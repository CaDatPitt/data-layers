A Pitt fraternity charged with
giving illegal rush bids won its
appeal in October, causing the
Greek community to question the
authority of the Office of Student
Affairs. ‘

In September, Pitt placed
sanctions on Delta Tau Delta after
two other fraternities, Pi Kappa
Alpha and Sigma Chi, brought

, charges to the judiciary board of

 

 

 

against them. The charges
alleged that ATA had given bids
to f1rst—semester freshmen before
they were allowed to pledge,
according to Kerry Daley, the
Greek advisor.

After a hearing before the
board, it was decided that Delta
Tau Delta would have to forfeit
their pledges from this semester
and be banned from participating
in rush events for the remainder
of this semester and all of next.

“We didn’t know anything
about [this incident] ,” said Nader

Abul-Ela, a member of the judi-
ciary board and president of
Kappa Sigma. “But after we
investigated, we even got signed
depositions from four of the
freshmen who received [the
bids].’’ ’

Abul-Ela said that after the
sanctions were announced, ATA
members were outraged.

“The president of the Delts
got up and yelled at us,” Abul-Ela
recalled. “He said, ‘This is far

from over,’ and then he stormed .

out. [ATA] claimed that they

should not be punished for this-

because freshmen are allowed» to
rush now. The point is, they bid
freshmen when it was illegal and
when we didn’t know if freshmen
would be eligible at all this term.”

Then on Oct. 8, the IFC
announced that the sanctions
against the Delts had been over-
turned. The judiciary members
were amazed.

“I was stunned,” Abul-Ela
said on hearing of the news at the
IFC meeting. “No one had any
clue they had appealed. It came

from nowhere. No one asked us
what evidence we had, why we
found them guilty, nothing. We
had the evidence; we made a
decision accordingly. Our deci-
sion wasn’t only questioned, it
was totally ignored.” '

The appeal process went
through the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs, the Greek advisor, and
the IFC president. Since Pat
Callahan, president of the IFC,
sat in on the board trial, he was
ineligible to take part in the

More than just teeth pulled from dental fraternity

After complaints about the un-neighborly behavior of the members of
Psi Omega, a graduate dental fraternity, Pitt revoked the traternity’s
lease to live in their Bellefield Ave. house. See page 3.

Pitt changes Greek Imperative
regulations with new IFC input

Karen Urbanik

 

The new mandates
regulating several facets of
Greek life, including rush

I and QPA standards, instat—

ed this summer have been
altered since their imple-
mentation this fall with
new input from fraternity
members.

Last year’s series of
fraternity suspensions
prompted the administra-
tion to set new standards
for fraternity members.
This semester, administra-
tors have challenged these
members to be responsible
for their actions through a

new set of guidelines that
both Greeks and Pitt’s
administration see as a
positive step towards a
healthy relationship.
Before he resigned
this summer, Leon Haley,
then vice chancellor of stu-
dent and public affairs, cre-
ated the Greek Life
Imperative Committee in
order to design a new set of
standards to be implement-
ed immediately in the
Inter-Fraternity Council.
These changes, which
only affected fraternities,
included a deferred fresh-
man rush and a 2.35 mm-
mum QPA in which a less-
er GPA would result in sus-

pension. Originally, the

average for the house had
to be equal to the all—male
average at Pitt.

The amendment,
which was a suggestion
from Haley, was put into
action by the Office of
Student Activities. These
policies are now re—amend—
ed by the IFC.

“This is something the
IFC has wanted to do for a
while,” said Nader Abul-
Ela, Kappa Sigma presi-
dent. “It will give the IFC
more control over what
happens within the Greek
community. It will make
things better for fraterni-

THE PITT NEWS

moves due to

neighbors’ complaints

Karen Urbanik

Pitt students won’t be able to make
jokes about the big tooth in the window
of 220 North Bellefield St. anymore.

That's because Psi Omega, the
graduate dental school fraternity, lost its
lease from Pitt this year due to resi-
dents’ complaints.

Last week at the City Planning
Commission meeting, neighbors in the
Bellefield section complained about
loud parties, the smell of pot, and drunk
people wandering around their neigh-
borhood. Suspicions were voiced that
the white tooth is a cover-up for illegal
activity. °

“This is a graduate fraternity,” said
Kerry Daley, assistant director of
Student Activities and the Greek advi-
sor. “It is ingno way affiliated with the
undergraduate Greek system.”

Pitt has been planning to move its
off-campus fraternity houses on cam-
pus. The complaints have given them
reason to speed up the process.

It was announced at the City

Planning Commission meeting that the
house and surrounding lots on North

Bellefield will be torn down and a con— 0

dominium with 46 units will be erected
to take its place, according the the Post-
Gazette. by

The Pitt—owned property was sold
to Crossgates Realty, Inc., who will
build the l3—story complex, complete
with parking garage for residents.

The old building was in need of
major repairs, and the parking lots have
been unused for years, according to
neighbors. The selling of the property
will benefit the neighbors of North
Belleﬁeld by not only getting rid of
their nemesis, but also by increasing
their property value with the new con-
dos.

The Pitt community also benefits
since the Greek houses will be assem-
bled in a more convenient manner.

Neighbors said Pitt has been very
accommodating in their concerns
recently. They feel that this is due to the
recent force of negative publicity
involving Pitt fraternities, especially
this past spring and summer.

Changes

ties. It will centralize the governing body
within the Greek community.”

After a roundtable discussion on Sept.
8 and 9 involving national and chapter
representatives from each house and
Keny Daley, the Greek advisor, the IFC
accepted the administration that would
best beneﬁt university students and the
Greek system. A

“We wanted to decide what was
going to be best,” said Pat Callahan, IFC
president. '

The most imperative concern was the
deferred freshman rush. Originally,
sophomores could rush, but freshmen
could not. During the roundtable, it was
decided to have a deferred one month
rush. Houses got their sophomore pledge
class in September and their freshman
class in October. Next year, formal rush
will be held in October.

“The deferred rush gives freshmen
the chance to get used to Pitt,” said
Callahan, “without losing the enthusiasm
of the first semester rush.”

The QPA requirement was dropped;
academic requirements will be left up to
individual houses based on their national

standards. .

P The IFC also implemented the Vice
Chancellor’s Cup. This recognition will be
awarded at the end of the year to the fra-
ternity with the highest overall QPA.

“I proposed that we make it open to _

all organizations except honors,” said
Mike Weber, president of Delta Tau Delta.
“That would make it more competitive.”
The roundtable also devised a new
appeals procedure. The original process
involved Director of Student Activities
Joe Cavella, Daley, and the IFC president.

The reformed appeals method is run ‘

by the IFC president, a member of the IFC
Executive Board, and the Greek advisor. It
will rely on a two—thirds decision. These
changes were implemented to provide fra-
ternities with more power within the
Greek system.

“Kerry [Daley] worked closely with
the IFC deciding how to leave power and
responsibility to the IFC to govern them-
selves,” said Bob Gallagher, interim vice
chancellor for student affairs. “We think
it’s a positive move. We’re giving them
more responsibility, and we expect them
to live up to that.”

ATA

' appeals process before it was amended this

semester.

Mike Weber, ATA president, said he
feels that Callahan inﬂuenced the board
before the trial took place. Weber said he
requested that Callahan not be part of the
appeal board for this case.

“I wasn’t involved at all,” Callahan
responded. “I had to brief the J-Board
before the trial because two of the mem-
bers belong to houses that accused [ATA].
They were asked to step down, and I
brought two members from my executive
board. I was "there because I had to explain
the procedure to them. I had no inﬂuence
on the J-Board.”

Weber said the appeal was based on
his feelings that the board made an unjust

decision due to Callahan’s involvement;

. Callahan said that the appeal “was not

made of procedural errors.”
According to Daley, the evidence the
board had collected was insufficient.-
“'I‘he investigation by the J -Board was
full of inconsistencies,” Daley stated. “It
was like the O.J. trial — the jury only saw

‘certain things. This was petty. It should

have been handled by the students.

“[The board] had invitations they
claimed were bids; they called people at
two in the morning,” she said. ‘This was a
shoddy investigation.”

Members of the board, however, feel
their authority as a governing body among
Greeks has been.challenged. “We don’t
understand how this could have hap-

 

pened,” Abul-Ela said. “This was a deﬁ-
nite rush infraction. I don’t know why
there is a J-Board if our decisions aren’t
going to be accepted.”

According to Daley, the sanctions
were unfair to brothers of ATA and to any
freshmen who might be discouraged from
expressing interest in joining ATA.

‘These sanctions were not fair to
freshmen who want to join Delta Tau
Delta,” Daley explained. “[Freshmen]\
should have the option of joining any fra-
ternity they want. They should be aware of
what is required of them. Freshmen should
read the rules.”

they do not feel that. the appeal was han-
dled in a questionable manner.

“This appeal never came to our
office,” said Robert Gallagher, interim
vice chancellor of student affairs. “It was
handled by Kerry Daley; she overturned
the IFC decision. It is my understanding
that it was in her View due to a lack of evi-
dence.”

Daley said this offense was not a
crime, and therefore it was not necessary
to appeal to a higher authority.

Daley opted to issue a warning to ATA
as she had for Delta Sigma Phi for the
same rush infraction this semester.

“Hopefully they received a wake-up call,” »

Daley said.

Weber said that they received a letter
reporting the overturning of the sanctions,
but he did not take this to be a warning. “I
guess you could say it was an indirect
warning if you were looking for it to be
one, but in the letter I received it didn’t say
anything like that.” .

“We do favors for [Kerry Daley], and
she does favors for us,” said Weber in his
first interview with The Pitt News. Weber
said his fraternitydid give illegal bids, but
that “lots of fraternities did. We weren’t the
only ones. Kerry Daley is our friend. We
look out for each other. You have to protect
each other.”

Weber has since recanted that state-
ment. -
“We know what we do. We are
responsible and careful,” said Weber in a
second interview. “We have a working,
professional relationship [with Daley]. We
meet with her to establish what is expect-
ed. We are not abusing anything.”

Weber expressed concern that other
fraternities would undermine the Greek
ethos by reporting them.

“It’s in our best interest to protect each
other,” Weber said. “As a whole, [Greeks]
have done stuff to dampen the View of this
system. There are enough people who

. want us to look bad, we don’t have to do it

to each other.”

According to Weber, this situation is
not unique.

“I don’t have a problem with [other

fraternities] trying to get around the rules,” ‘

Weber related. “We pride ourselves on not
getting in trouble. We have social moni-
tors. I am on the J -Board. There are things
you see that you don’t tell to protect other
houses. You expect them to do the same.”

Members of Sigma Chi and Pi Kappa
Alpha suggested that Daley made a deci-
sion based on personal preference rather
than evidence.

Daley denied these allegations. She
said she has a purely professional relation-
ship with the Greeks at Pitt.

“I have to work with them every day,”
she said. “Sometimes you have to make
decisions, and it is hard because you know

these guys and you like them. But it is my .

job to be fair. They respect me because
they know I will treat every case fairly
because they are my frien .”

Union

ments, but the union organizers are work-
ing to get students from the sciences and
professional schools involved.

“We’ve just started the drive, so basi-
cally we’re just starting to ask people to
organize. Anyone who’s interested  can
help us address the problems and viola-
tions that we see on a regular basis,” White
said. “We’re really trying to be proactive
at this point by focusing [the campaign] on
our contributions and on the solutions to
the problems we face.”

A recent survey of graduate students
by the Graduate Student Association
shows many grad students agree with the
complaints COGS has raised.

Over 47.5 percent of the grad students
surveyed said they work more hours than
they’re contracted for, 47.1 percent said
they have almost no voice in their depart-
ments, and 37.5 percent of them said
they’ve censored written or_ classroom
work because they fear administrative
sanctions.

Margarite Brown, of the History
Department, said the living wage offered
to grad students must be increased
because the current wage does not account
for all the time grad students must put into
their work. .

“The stipend is $10,400, at least in the
History Department, which our adrninis—
tration says is a living wage for nine
months. But unfortunately, our work con-
tinues for 12 months,” Brown said.

Because so much of their time in the
fall and spring terms is focused on teach-
ing, Brown said grad students’ summer
preparation for their jobs deserve to be
considered as work for the University.

“As grad students we need to work in

the summer doing research to maintain
familiarity with our ﬁeld,” she said. “It’s
very difficult to do that and work 40 hours
a week at a temporary job making seven
dollars an hour. It’s not that we’re asking
to get paid in the summer when we’re not
actually working. [A higher wage] is just
an acknowledgment that our work as grad-
uate students contributes to the
University.”

Vanessa Sterling, also from the
History Department, said most grad stu-
dents understand that they will have to put
in more hours than they are contracted for,
but that Pitt should have a grievance pro-

cedure so the University can’t take advan—_

tage of those students.
“You grade until you’re done grading,

 

and you meet with as many students as
you have to. If somebody gets sick you
cover for their class  The question is
‘How do you get paid for this?’ And the
answer is ‘You don’t,’” Sterling said.

Changes in curriculum, class require-
ments, and exams are other conﬂicts grad
students get in with their superiors, and
Sterling said a grievance procedure would
help remedy them.

“Who can you go to to address these
grievances and problems now?” Sterling
asked at a recent COGS meeting. “Can
you go to the chair [of a department]? Can
you go to the Dean?  The Dean’s going
to say, ‘Go talk to your chair’  Your chair
is going to say ‘Gee that is a problem.
Hmrn. Well, Sorry. Nothing we can do.”’

Sterling said COGS can help set up
the needed grievance council and appoint
a mediator to negotiate these complaints.

“Our options are very limited, and this
is not way to function,” she said. “Having
dual jobs- here as both students and
employees, we face harassment from both
directions  whether it’s sexual harass-
ment, ethnic-based harassment, or criti-

' cism of our work based on political ideas.”

Sterling stressed that the only way
grad students can solve these problems is
by banding together.

“Realistically, we’re not going to get
the things we need just by asking for

them,” she said. “We’re going to get them,

in the context of a larger struggle, and that
is the union struggle.” .

Delta Tau Delta controversy
needs to be re-examined  

The authority of the Office of Student Affairs has been
the subject of speculation regarding its decision in the appeal
of Delta Tau Delta. The fraternity was appealing eharges that
it had given bids to ﬁrst-semester freshmen before they were
allowed to pledge.

When the case was originally brought before the judicial
board of the Inter-Fratemity Council, Delta Tau Delta was
banned from participating in any rush events for the remain-
der of this semester and all of next semester. It was also
decided that they must forfeit their pledges from this semes-
ter.

When the case was appealed, rather than being referred
to the Office of Student Affairs where it would be presided
over by Robert Gallagher, interim vice chancellor of student
affairs, it was handled by Keny Daley, the Greek advisor. She
overturned the decision of the Inter~Fraternity Council.
Because this was not a crime, she said, it need go no further.

The members of the Inter-Fraternity Council were sur-
prised to see their sanctions against Delta Tau Delta over-
turned as they had come up with evidence in their investiga-
tion which supported their decision including signed deposi-
tions from four freshmen who had received bids.

After all of the effort that has been put into revising the
Greek system including the Greek roundtable and other mea-
sures which were taken, this is a matter which should be
investigated. The Office of Student Affairs needs to look into
whether it was appropriate for this matter to have been settled
by someone, the Greek advisor. The decision-making process
on these matters should be re—exarnined. '

It is unfair not find out whether or not there actually was
a violation by any party in this matter. This is not to say that
there was any impropriety in this matter, but due to the dif-
ferences in opinion by the Inter—Fratemity Council and the
Office of Student Affairs, particularly the Greek advisor, it
needs to be reviewed.

Suffering students need more breaks

 

Is it me, or is this semester really
dragging? Thanksgiving should be
earlier this year. We need a break, and

we need it now —— or anyway, sooner ,

than two and a half weeks from now.
We’ve already had 10 weeks of class,
and in the remaining ﬁve we have

' Thanlagiving break. It doesn’t make

much mental health sense to have 12
weeks of class and then a break and a
remaining measly two weeks before
Christmas break. We need to demand
that Thanksgiving be a couple of
weeks earlier.

Why isn’t there a break before
Thanksgiving anyway? CMU has a
mid-semester break. OK, so that
sounds like a little kid complaining
jealously that the neighbor’s kid has a
later curfew. But it is true; Pitt needs a
break for its suffering students before
the end of November. An earlier break
could only beneﬁt the University and
its students.

Obviously, students appreciate
any breaks. since they always jump on
a chance to read extra material for
class to enrich their understanding.
Naturally, they also take advantage of
time to read those novels they’ve
always been meaning to read. In addi-
tion, they like to take the opportunity
to socialize to discuss complex philo-
sophical life questions.

All right, maybe the last couple of
statements are a little exaggerated.
However, breaks are sure preventions
of burnout and loss of motivation.
Especially right before midterms, a
break would be conducive to
improved study habits. Midterrns

come at the exact point in the semester
when students start to yearn for a
break. This means it’s precisely the
time that motivation starts to drop. A
break to focus on midterrns would def-
initely help students to keep from
becoming frustrated by combined
feelings of mid—semester burnout and
exam stress.

Besides, having students wait all
the way until Thanksgiving for their
ﬁrst break also forces them to store up
all that lack of motivation. Therefore,
it all gets released during that (by then
long—awaited) break, and they don’t do
any work at all, which results in a
rather poor showing the week of class-
es immediately following the break.

Another factor is student resent-
ment. Being ready for break long
before it arrives, students start seeing
themselves as captives of the
University. Resentment slowly builds
until it’s common to hear depreciating
comments about the lovely city of
Pittsburgh and the charming Pitt carn-
pus. An earlier break would prevent
this accumulation of unneeded disen-
chantrnent.

Also possible are feelings of
annoyance towards certain aggravat-
ing professors, fellow students, or
roommates. These feelings would be
inconsequential if nipped in the bud.
But they can fester into major person-
ality conﬂicts if left all the way until
Thanksgiving. An earlier break would
therefore also reduce the amount of
ﬁghts and student—to—student or stu-
dent-to-teacher confrontations.

All of the above factors are par-
ticularly prevalent arnong freslunen,
since they are experiencing their ﬁrst
semester of the often hectic pace of

University life. Also, some ﬁrst-year
students (as well as upperclassmen
who can admit it) might start to be
plagued by bouts of homesickness. It
would be especially beneﬁcial to ﬁrst-
year students to have an earlier break,
since resentment at such an early stage
in University life is hardly encourag-
ing.
The University could do nothing
but gain by making the ﬁrst break at a
sooner and more logical point in the
semester. Students would perform bet-
ter on their midterm exams. Freshmen
would be happier upon their returns
from break. Burnout would be much
less severe, especially among hard-
working upperclassmen (those dili-
gent individuals being the most prone
to total collapse during the turkey
days).
Since resentment wouldn’t have
had a chance to build to high levels,

‘students would be more content in

their attitudes towards classes and
campus. This would rub off onto visit-
ing prospective students as well, giv-
ing Pitt a better image, since more pos-
itive comments would be made about
the University. More students would
perform better on their ﬁnals as well,
since they will have prepared more for
the week right after the Thanksgiving
break. Interpersonal relationships of
students and faculty would be more
harmonious with a cool—oﬂ° period at a
more strategic point during the semes-
ter to regain calm attitudes.

All in. all, it’s a splendid idea to
have a mid-semester break. Besides,
CMU has one. why can’t we?

Machteld de Waarrl is counting the
days.

Holyfield
rekindles the
good times

 

Every now and again some-
thing magical happens in the
world of sports. Something so
special that it serves as a perma-
nent reminder of why sports
impact our lives.

Saturday night showcased
why sports are such an important
entity —— it showed why we love
sports. One man, Evander
Holyfield, at one point a 25:1
underdog against the supposedly
invincible Mike Tyson, fought all
the odds and firmly placed him-
self amongst sports all-time great
men.

A man’s man.

During all the pre-fight
hoopla, it wasn’t Holyfield’s cor-
ner talking trash —— it was Team
Tyson with diarrhea of the mouth.
Holyfield acted as few athletes
do; he kept his mouth shut and
prepared to let his fists do the
talking.

Once the opening bell rung for
round one, Holyfield’s fists
wouldn’t shut up. Although most
judges and pay-per-View analysts
said Tyson won the opening
round, it was painfully obvious
that Holyfield would not be intim-
idated. Then again, a man’s man
won’t back down.

Holyfie_ld won the next three
rounds, going blow-for-blow with
boxing’s most dangerous puncher.
Holyfield won all those rounds,
until the fifth. Just when Tyson
looked like he’d gain some
momentum, Holyfield came out in
the sixth and shook up the world.

After a series of blows by both
battle-tested combatants,
Holyfield rocked Tyson with a

Penn State drowns
men's swimming
and diving team

 gun Borofski

The Pitt men’s swim-
ming and diving team suf-
fered its first loss this week-
end as they fell to Penn State,
128-115, at Trees Pool
Saturday afternoon.

Pitt trailed by four points
going into the ﬁnal event, the
400-free, but came up short
when they only placed sec-
0nd.

‘‘I think we did very
well,” Coach Chuck Knoles
said. “This is one of those
meets where you can be
pleased with the perfor-
mance of the swimmers and
not pleased with the out-
come.”

Penn State took first and
second in the 400—medley
relay, while Pitt gamered the
bottom three positions. The
Panthers bounced back by
sweeping the 1000—free. Pete
Hezky took first place with a
time of 9:29.18, improving
his previous best time of
9:38.57, set at last week’s
Syracuse meet. He was fol-
lowed by Brett Collins and

 

Preston Hammontree.

“Our distance events
went really well,”
Hammontree said. “We
needed to have good swims,
.and we did just that.”

Pitt also took first and
third in the following event,
the 200—free. Eric Stefanski
captured first with a time of
1:41.38.

Penn State took the top
three in the 50—free, and Pitt
freshman Jerry Koller’s
21.54 took fourth place. 1

After senior John
Soulakis took first in the 1-
meter diving competition
with a score of 2:15.40, the
Panthers only trailed by six
points, 59-53. ‘

Pitt came back out of the
water with its second sweep
of the meet, this time in the
200-ﬂy. Led by first place
ﬁnisher Jonathan Haggerty
with a time of 1:53.93,'fresh-
man Regan Drew and sopho-
more Mike Tortorici both
bettered their previous best
times.

Pitt also took first place
in the two events following.

Jennie Driscoll ended
her regular—season career
yesterday at the Fitzgerald
Field House with a team-
high 21 kills, and three others
finished with at least 10
spikes as the Panther volley-
ball team rallied to beat the
Connecticut Huskies in a
four—set thriller.

“UConn is a really nice
team,” said Pitt Head Coach
Cindy Alvear. “They bring a
lot of heat to the court 
serving, attacking.” .

Pitt (20—9, 8-1 Big East)

took out conference foes

Connecticut (7-15, 15-11,
15-10, 15-12) and St. John’s
en route to another undefeat-
ed weekend at home. Both
matches, especially Sunday’s
contest against the Huskies,
didn’t end without a ﬁght.
UConn (17-11, 5-4) took
the first set thanks in part to
textbook serving and crisp
passing across the front lines.

Huskie hitter J enelle Koester, -

who led all players with 24
kills and 16 digs, was a big
factor in the game one win.

“We blocked one of our
poorer matches,” Alvear said
of the squad, “mostly based
on [Connecticut’s] attack-
ing.”

Pitt‘ jumped out to a 5-0
lead in game two, only to

- Zemrowski blocks

watch the pesky Huskie
squad score five straight
points‘ of their own. After
three lead exchanges, the

9 Panthers took the lead for

good at 9-8. Freshman
Melissa Alpers capped off
the second stanza with a kill
down the middle. She fin-
ished with four kills and 13
digs for the afternoon.

Game three began in
Connecticut’s favor. Head
Coach Ellen Crandall’s
squad jumped out to leads of
5-1 and 9-4 before Pitt mid-
dle hitter Peggy Meinhart
took charge. The freshman
assisted on two Paula
and
brought the squad within one
at 9-8 with a twisting spike
past Huskie hitter Heather
Sokol. The Panthers took
seven of the next eight points
and game three for a 2-to-1
lead.

“We have to get to a
point where we can keep the
same constant mindset on the
court,” said Alvear, explain-
ing the team’s recent‘ “on
again, off again” play.
“We’re a good team; it only
gets frustrating out there
because [the team] lets it be.”

Driscoll and ﬁrst-year
player Julie Cress led the
attack in the ﬁnal stanza as
the squad clinched its 20th
victory of the year with a 15-

- Maybe it is the coaching. New Cincinnati
Coach Bruce Coslet used a short-pass strategy
to beat the Pittsburgh Stcelers 34-24.
Cincinnati has its ﬁrst three-game win-
ning streak since 1990. The Bengals are 4-6.
The Steelers are 7-3. ' 5 *
Highlights for the Bengals include David
Dunn’s 90-yard kickoff retum for a TD on the
last play of the ﬁrst half. Then in the second,
Eric Bieniemy had a 33-yard touchdown run,
the Bengals’ longest of the season, and Ki-
Jana Carter scored two touchdowns in the
game.
0 Philadelphia’s win streak ended at four games
with a 24-17 loss to Buffalo. The Bills shut
down the Eagles with ﬁve sacks. One of those
sacks came when Bruce Smith caught Ty
Detmer on a fourth-and-goal at the three-yard
line in the garne’s ﬁnal minute.
Detrner completed 26 of 42 passes for
315 yards and two touchdowns. Jim Kelly’s
numbers weren’t as impressive -- 11 of 22 for
112 yards and a touchdown, but Kelly got the
win.
Thurman Thomas gave Buffalo 90
yards on 22 rushes.
The outcome leaves both teams with 7-3
records.

- Miami dealt Indianapolis a fourth consecu-
tive defeat, 37-13.

Dan Marino threw the 4,000th comple-
tion of his career. He also crossed 50,000 yards
in career passing. In the game, he was 17 of 24
for 204 yards with three touchdowns. Fred
Barnett caught two of those touchdowns.

The Dolphin defense recorded a safety,
intercepted Jim Harbaugh twice, and held
Marshall Faulk to 13 yards rushing on ten
carries.

The blowout leaves both teams 5-5.

0 Kansas City grabbed the early lead and held
off Green Bay 27-20. Greg Hill had touch-
down runs of eight and 24 yards and added
another score on a 34-yard, reception. The
Chiefs ﬁnished with 383 yards against the
NFL’s top—rated defense.

KC improves to 7-3. The Packers slide to

8-2.
0 Tampa Bay beat Oakland 20-17 on Michael
Husted’s 23-yard ﬁeld goal in overtime. The
Buccaneers got their chance to win when
Oak1and’s Cole Ford missed a 28-yarder with
ﬁve seconds left in regulation. Ford had hit a
45-yarder into the wind earlier in the game
before hooking the short attempt left

Trent Dilfer drove the Bucs 57 yards for

the winning score. He ﬁnished 20-28 for 192 ‘

yards with two touchdowns and one intercep-

tron.

The outcome leaves Tampa Bay with a 2-
8 record. The Raiders have fallen to 4-6.

- The St. Louis Rams enjoyed their highest-
scoring day in 20 years. They pounded Atlanta
59-16.

Lawrence Phillips had the Rams’ ﬁrst
100-yard rushing day since 1994 —— 106 yards
on 14 carries, and Tony Banks completed 15
of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touch-
downs. 3

Harold Green also rushed for 106 yards
and scored a pair of touchdowns.

St. Louis climbs to 3-7, and the Falcons

Orleans.

The Oilers climb to 64. The Saints are 2-

- New England rallied ﬁom 21 points down to
beat the New York Jets 3 1-27. Drew Bledsoe’s
two-yard pass to Keith Byars with just over

alive by a controversial spot by oﬁicials.

The victory keeps the Patriots, at 7-3, tied

ﬁeld goal attempt in overtime gave Arizona a
clumsy 37-34 win over Washington.

Butler missed a 32-yard attempt early in
the overtime. Then Washington’s Scott
Blanton hit a 43-yard ﬁeld goal, but that was
wiped out by a holding penalty. Blanton then
missed from 48 yards.

Butler hit the upright on a 37-yard attempt
in the overtJ'me’s ﬁnal minute, but the Redskins

Holyfield, a man’s man, knew it.

Few moments in sports histo-

For those of you not in the know,
Pitt’s Dan Marino capped an

incredible season with a come-—

Steelers eventually lost that

and awe-inspiring. I felt the same

Maybe moments like these

Holyfield did to Tyson, but they

He shouldn’t have to, but

Swim

Freshman Brian secured the
200-back title with a strong
time of 1:48.58, and sopho-
more Preston Hammontree
won the 500—free in 4:35.94.
Penn State took second and
third in both events.

“I think a big factor of the
meet was that Penn State rested
before swimming us,”
Hammontree said. “They
always rest for us. We don’t
rest for anyone.”

Going into the second half
of the diving competition, Pitt
was ahead, 98-90. Soulakis was
the top Panther ﬁnisher at third,
with a score of 189.00, and

 

behind him in fourth with
160.30 points.

Pitt then took second and
third in the 200—breast, making
the score 115-111.

“We’d like to win every
meet, and we’d like to beat our
arch rivals, Penn State,” Knoles
said. “That would be exciting

to do. But I» am not willing to '

change our training schedule.
We look at the season from a
holistic viewpoint.”

The 3-] men’s swimming
and diving team defeated last
