UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Political Union Sets
First Meeting; Laws
87. Constitution Topics

‘ The proposed Political.

Union will make its first real
step to promoting “critical
thinking on social issues”
when presidents of nine or-
ganizations that will hold
seats in the union meet next
Wednesday to discuss the con-
stitution and perhaps draft by-
laws. ‘

Unless serious opposition to
the union . appears, Bill Cabin,
president of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa (ODK) which initially guided
the idea of a broadly based dis-
cussion group, expects the Poli-
tical Union to present its ﬁrst
program by_ the middle of the
winter term. “We can’t set up a
grand program until a so-und base
is established,” noted Cabin.

Forums and discussions spon-
sored by the Political Union will
be on a wide variety of issues,
not necessarily, or even largely,
campus issues. Topics such as
civil rights, selected areas of for-
eign policy (Vietnam, NATO,
etc.), education, the arts, and
drug usage would be handled in
the programs.

During the summer, Cabin sent
questionn.aires dealing with the
idea of a Political Union to 43
members of the University com-
munity. Seventy per cent of the
questionnaires were returned
and revealed a strong suport for
such an organization among stu-

The questionnaire also illum-

must be resolved before the Poli-

These include:

> Whether programs should be

arranged by individual groups in

the Union or whether all organi-
zations with an interest in the
chosen topic should work_ to-
gether to decide’ on these pro-
ST 31115;

>What should be the format
of the programs (should they be
parliamentary debates, panel dis-
cussions or open forums);

> Should only recognized Uni-

versity organizations be allowed .

to participate in the union as
permanent members or should
outside groups be allowed to en-

> Should the program be ﬁ-
nanced out of the student activ-
ities fee or the Student Affairs
general budget? ~

Organizations that will be rep-

Last March, more than

2,000 University undergrad-
uates took a poll aimed at

«discovering their attitudes

attitudes toward state related-
ness and the trimester calen-
dar. The results of the Stu-
dent Government (SG) sponsored
poll have now been released.
They reveal strong student‘ feel-
ings that tuition rates are in-
will lower academic quality, and

equitable, that state relatedness
that the trimester system is val-
uable.

Approximately 55 per cent of
the out-of-state students who par-
ticipated in the poll declared
that they would transfer to an-
other school if in-state _~ tuition
dropped while out-of-state tuition
remained unchanged. This strong

statement led Loren Hershey, the-

SG senator who announced-the re-
sults, to remark that SG must-
now take a ﬁrm stand on a re-
duction of out-of-state tuition.

Can they—or can’t they? That’s'the question.

Will the new six-floor life sciences complex be finished
by its target date _of June, 1967? -

Ground will be broken for the $3.5 million project next
Wednesday at 10’a.m. Whichleaves a scant nine months

until proposed completion.

The building, to be named Craw-
ford Hall after the University’s
13th chancellor, Stanton Chap-
man Crawford, will be located to
the rear of Langley Hall at Eige-
low Blvd; and Tennyson Ave.
Crawford, Langley and Clapp
Halls will be interconnecting.

The ‘project will be ﬁnanced

Producer — Director Speaks‘

HEP Orients Tutors

By MARY L. BROWN

When John Cochran, producer-
director and celebrated Negro ac-
tor, Was a boy in a Detroit ghet-
to, he used to tell his mother
about all the things he was going
to be, where he was going to go,
what he was going to do. “Son,”
his mother replied, “It’s more
than a notion.” Cochran contin-
ued in his kick-off speech for the
Hill Education Project (HEP) tu-
tors Monday evening, that like
every child, not just the under-
priviliged one in the Negro ghet-
to, he wanted to achieve without
“paying the dues.”

The child wants to achieve
identity, said Cochran, and the
dues are acceptance of pain and
humility, “saying ‘yes’ to life.”
For the underpriviliged child,
the dues are often too high, the
HEP’S goal is to provide a tutor-
tutee relationship with the child
which offers him more than an
educational boost toward the
achievement he dreams about.
HEP hopes to provide him with
the immediate satisfaction of in-
terracting with adults of his own
and other races in creative per-
sonal and group relationships.

The realities which the child
faces are stressed and utilized in
the project. According to a bulle-
tin distributed to the "volunteer
tutors at the meeting, the project
is “grounded in the concrete sit-

  

inter_ V 

Cochran who graduated from
Wayne State University in De-
troit and received his master’s
degree from UCLA in psychi-
atric social work, uses these real-
ities in his theraputic approach to
the HEP theatre which he directs.
“It is better,” he said, .“to kill a
man on the stage than to walk
outside and kill him.” For this
reason he chooses plays which
reflect the social problems faced
by participating students.

“The white man,” said Coch-
ran, “must understand the eco-
nomic and emotional reasons
why he invented a ‘nigger,’ a
creature which doesn’t exist and
never existed.”

The new hall will house class
rooms and laboratories of the De-
partment of Microbial and Mole-
cular Biology and Psychology.

Dr. Crawford, .who until his
death Jan. 26, was a teacher.
dean, administrator, and ﬁnally
acting chancellor, was posthum-

ously named by the’ Board of“

Trustees as chancellor.

Speakers for the - ceremonies
will be Dr. David H. Kurtzman,
acting chancellor, and Dr. David
Halliday, dean of the Division of
Natural Sciences and a long time
colleague and friendiof the late
Dr. Crawford._

Guests will include Mrs. Craw-
ford, and state, federal, and local
civic officials.

Architec_ts are Kuhn, Newcom-
er and Valentour.

Manning, SG president, stated, '

“If we are to maintain a quality
state institution, the problem of 
out - of - state tuition reduction"
must be’ dealt with immediately. -\
In solving this problem, a bal- "
ance must be maintained be- -‘
tween the price paid for an.edu- 4'
cation and the quality inherent’ 
in it. The ﬁrst step SG will take "
to achieve this goal is to urge
for -a tuition drop to three times ‘
as much at ﬁrst, and later ap'- I
proach a greater reducﬁon if»
quality of education is not sacri-

ﬁed.” . . 
The question of quality" also’,
concerned many of the polled
students. Close to 64 per cent of :

out-of-state students and _41 per
cent of in-state students indicated-
their belief that academic qual- 7?
ity would decline as a result 01‘, 
state relatedness. Eight per cent 4
of the in-state pollees said that
they would consider transfering._
to another university if state re-‘ 
latedness became ﬁnal. Only ten ’

per cent believed standards would 5
be raised as the result of stronger;
state ties. 

The trimester system received =
huge support from the under-7.
graduates. Eighty-six per cent in- ,
dicated a deﬁnite preference for ’
the trimester system over either _;
the quarter or normal semester I;
calendars. The trimester system
was the main reason why 27 per
cent of the pollees entered the '-f_
University in the ﬁrst place.

The Trimester Analysis and
Survey Committee, which com-
piled the report, said, “a lower-
ing of tuition for in-state and
out-of-state students should re-‘
sult i'n a high rate of increase 2%
in enrollment for the Spring tri-f
mester.” The low enrollment dur-
ing this third trimester has been
the major criticism of the trimes-
ter calendar. ‘ * -

Speaker Points Out ,  
Unpublicized UN Jobs S

“Our chief hope against mili-
tary holocust” lies with the Unit-
ed Nations, according to George
Bebee, history professor from
Long Island University, Brooklyn
campus. .

Bebee told a scant dozen mem-

bers of the College Council on
the United Nations (CCUN), “We
Americans don’t realize how
much investment we have in the
UN.” . -
He cited some of the less well-
known functions of the interna-
tional organization, such as the
maintainance of a giant interna-
tional civil service. “We aren’t
aware of the difficulties involved
in the civil service management
—the vast range of bosses, the
vast area of conﬂict, the vast
area of demand,” continued Be-
bee.

But when asked whether the
UN can keep the peace, Bebee
abruptly replied, “Temporarily,
no. It couldn't afford a. major
conflict todayigf P   -~ -

   
         

 
  
  
    
   
   
   
    
     
       
       
   
      

 

cy.” Bebee recalled the “endless
talks, the endless bargaining’’' in
lobbies and hotels miles from the‘
actual UN building. ‘ ‘ if

Of all the groups promoting"
public understanding of the UN
and its functions, the Quaker ex-H
cell in ‘spending the most" tim 
energy and money to this end;
Bebee said. 

Composed ofonly 80,000 mem-
bers, the Quakers maintain a con-7
verted building near the UN: at”
which delegates from various“.
countries, such as Albania, aire,
their grievances-—-“off the record?’
—to delegates from other coun“
tries.

Time To Act

Needed: A

‘ UPON THE resignation of
Dr. Edward Litchﬁeld as
 chancellor of the University,

‘the Board of Trustees estab-
lished a special Chancellor’s
Search . Committee. This
search group has been look-
-ing for more than a year
without ﬁnding a man to ﬁll
_, the chancellor’s spot. But

i the need for a chancellor is
 i now becoming acute and the
1.; committee, along with the
—_ trustees, must choose a man.
7 ' It is both trite and true to
. say that, since Dr. _Litch-

versity has undergone great
. change. The University has
. gotton through this period
.~ of change without a chancel-
-lor. Why is one needed now?
The answer lies in the na-
ture of the change in the
past year and the nature of
I the change that must occur
in the future. Throughout
the past year, the University
has been acted upon. Be-
cause of the action of non-
University agencies, this
school has survived a ﬁnan-
cial _, crisis and has become
state-related. The Univers-
ity’s present position has
been dtermined largely by
forces outside the school
community.
 NOW THAT a series of
great changes have been
made, a second stage of
adaptation to these changes
demands the University’s at-
tention. It also demands a
dynamic leader with initia-
tive capacities. A chancellor
is needed to shape policy that
will keep the University on a
high academic plane, while
serving the needs of higher
‘education in Western Penn-
fsjdvania. He must decide on
ta." policy that will prevent pro-
vincialism by attracting fac-
_ulty and students from wide-
ly divergent backgrounds
and geographical areas. He

 H I The results of the Student Government poll reveal an unfortunate
‘amount of superstitition and supposition pervading the mindset of the stu-
dent body. A disturbing number of students seem ready to condemn the
«idea of state-relationship without having investigated the situation an
3 given the idea rational consideration. I
,' Over 64 percent of out-of-state students and 41 percent of in-state
‘jstudents felt that academic quality would decline as a result of state-relat-
i’:edness.. This is typical of those who ‘would. quickly equate a publicly aided-
fschool with low quality mass education. . -
4 Nothing could be more irrational in today’s educational world. The
greatest center of graduate study in this country—-the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley—is publicly supported.‘
The Universities of Wisconsin and Michigan and the State Univers-
ity of New York at Stoneybrook stand out as institutions of higher learn-
ing dependent upon state aid.
While it can be argued that there are many state schools with limited
resources, it can also be said that there are an equal number of private
college and universities which are of a dubious calibre.
But in the final analysis it is useless to argue about what is going on e
at other schools. What is of greatest moment is the progress our Univers-
ity is making or not making towards becoming a great institution.

will have to achieve and
maintain a measure of pri-
vate support if the Universi-
ty is to retain any private
character. He will be respon-
sible for guiding the physi-
cal and population expansion

of the University without oc-
casioning another ﬁnancial

crisis.

These needs, plus many
others, require a solution
that must start now. Acting
Chancellor David Kurtzman,
an extremely capable admin-
istrator, cannot do the job in
his present position. Both
Dr. Kurtzman and his pre-
decessor, the late Stanton C.
Crawford, were hampered by
the fa.ct that the new chan-
cellor might not agree with
policies an acting chancellor
made and would change them
before they could have any
effect.

This aspect of the acting
chancellor’s job was men-
tioned by Dr. Crawford when
he ﬁlled the position. He ex-
plained that the job of the
acting chancellor is to react
to» emergency situations and
keep the University relative-
ly stable until a chancellor
is chosen. An acting chan-
cellor cannot establish long-
range goals and programs.

. Such long- range programs

are needed to deal with the
problems mentioned above.

‘Dr. Kurtzman recently said,
“We will not sacriﬁce quality
just to have a chance11or."
But, after a year, the Board
of Trustees should be able
to appoint a new, qualiﬁed
man to the chancellor’s seat,
or else allow Dr. Kurtzman
to use all his capabilities by
elevating him to chancellor.
In the last 12 months, the
University has been acted
upon. Now the University
must adapt by means of ac
tion from within. —

. Pitt in the end will be what it wants to be. The record of other state
school clearly indicates that extensive’ public support neither precludes nor
guarantees greatness. If the students are really concerned are where we
are going they can inevitably be the best judges by simply Watching what's
happening on campus.

For example, are the great professors of the University leaving en
masse? It appears to us that this is not the case and the faculty seems
stronger than it has ever been in recent years. Are new programs being

initiated which will broaden the scope of educational resources? Again it

new Center for International Studies came,

seems the University is continuing on a road of growth in this area. On the
, heels of the finalization of the state relationship, the announcement of the

Moreoverthe same broad-based and dynamic building program seen
for the last decade continues today. Never in its two hundred year history

has the University been expanding so many facilities at the same time.

respective schools can express their concerns about our future course. We

Editorial Attacked
By SU Chairman

Editor, The Pitt News:

May I clarify a few points that
were raised in today‘s Editorial
column? I can only speak for,
the Public Affairs Committee of
the Student Union Board. How-
ever, in this area alone, I think
it can be said that the students
of Pitt are offered a varied and
substantial program throughout
the year. First, simply because
there are only two names listed

on the Student Activities Calen- '

dar as Midday speakers, this does
not mean that we will have only
two speakers this year.

As I told one of your report-

ers earlier this year, the commit:-‘

tee could not publish in the cal-
endar names of speakers who
had not signed their contracts.
Second, the article spoke .of a
“gap” in programming. I fail to
see any validity in this statement.
On the calendar there are listed
two ﬁlms and a forum for this
period alone which according to
article lacks anything to keep up
the students’ interest in major
events.

Finally, as issues come up, the
Public ‘Affairs Committee has in
the past and will continue in the
future to sponsor forums, discus-
sions, etc. (i.e. Doctor Kurtzman’s
open forum on state relationship,
the debate among the three par-
ties running for student govern-
ment, the coming forums on Penn-
sylvania Politics, Black Power,
e’tc.).

May I close by saying that Pitt
News can only judge accurately
the first month’s programming.
Perhaps, on our part, one film
and the fair is not enough for
September. You have the right
to hold that opinion, if you wish.
I personally feel September is
the time for readjusting to school
and laying solid plans for tri-
mester.

Shapp Column Hit
By Law Student

Editor, The Pitt News:

The political perspicacity of
the two writings concerning our
“Man for the Times,” Milton
Shapp, has led me to enter this
plea.

I am strongly opposed to peo-
ple who ﬁll the editorial page of
a newspaper with suchblatantly
chauvinistic writings. If one feels
that political advertisements are
needed, I would suggest that the
required space be purchased, fo-r
the editorial page is no place for

' political ads. Agreed that the edi-

torial page is for opinions, often
openly biased opinions, but let
the opinions ﬁrst be considered
and thoughtful journalism.

I would welcome seeing an in-.
telligent commentary concerning
the Shapp-Shafer campaign on
the editorial page,__but please, no
more of these — Shapp equals ra-
tionality and enlightenment, Shaf-
er equals Batman and emotional-
ism —— polemics. Such writings
show both little respect for the
intelligence of Pitt students, and,
little intelligence.

signs of this progress, we are sure it will inevitably appear.

Rugby Fan Asks

For Coverage
Editor, The Pitt News:

As an enthusiastic fan of the
Pittsburgh Rugby Club, I was
highly disappointed with the in-
adequate article in the Septem-
ber 16 issue of The Pitt News.
Both the Pittsburgh club and rug-
by itself deserve more coverage
than a poorly-written, two-para-
graph item, particularly since the
Pittsburgh club had an undefeat-
ed season this past spring.

The description of rugby as “a
sort of combination of touch foot-
ball and soccer” leaves, essential-
ly, the wrong impression. Rugby
is a rough, man’s game, made
rougher by the complete absence
of padding, blocking, time-outs,
and substitution. It is also a team
game, with a great deal of pass-
ing, kicking, and running.

Every rugby team is a social
club as well, and the home team
hosts the visitors at a party, of-
ten with dancing and always
with refreshment, on the evening
after the game.

A lifelong sports fan, I can
honestly say that rugby provides-
more enjoyment for both players
and spectators than any other
sport I know of. I would hope
that, on this basis, the Pitt News
will show a bit more interest in
the Pittsburgh Rugby Club, not

. least because it contains a num-

ber of Pitt students and faculty
members. I also hope that some

, Pitt News readers will find time

to attend a game some Saturday
afternoon to judge for ’ them-
selves.. If Penn State can or-
ganize a complete team, Pitt
should at least be able to provide
some additional players for an
existing one.

“Operation Abolition”

Criticized In New Film

By HOBART HARRIS
“Operation Abolition” is

the most famous film in_

American political history.
It was produced by the
House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee to show that

student demonstrations outside
of the San Francisco hearings of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee were Communist led
and inspired.

The American Civil Liberties
Union of Northern California has
answered these accusations with
a ﬁlm of its own, entitled “Oper-
ation Correction,” which was
shown Monday night in the Stu-
dent Union side by side with
“Operation Abolition.” ‘The ﬁlm
attempts to refute, charge by
charge, the accusations of the
Committee. While doing this, it
takes “Operation Abolition” to
task for extensive falsiﬁcation of
the facts.

The central thesis of “Opera-
tion Abolition is that when the
Un-American Activities Commit-
tee decided to hold hearings in
the San Francisco Area on May
12 to 14, 1960, the Communist
Party incited and organized riots,
mostly among gullible college
students and sympathizers to pro-
test the Committee’s plans.

“Operation Abolition” began
with the statement that the Com-‘
munists had prepared for the
hearings “months in advance.”
However, the “Operation Cross-.
roads” narrator pointed out that
the Committee had announced
its intention to come to San Fran-
cisco only 16 days in advance of
the hearings. '

One of “Operation Abolition’s”
consistent charges concerned the
events that occurred Friday af-
ternoon, the second day of the
hearings. It was on this day that
the San Francisco Police Depart-
ment turned ﬁre hoses upon a
mob of students within the San
Francisco City Hall as they were
trying to get into the hearing
room itself.

The Committee’s descriptions
of the crowd’s actions seemed to

be out of proportion to what had
actually happened. The Commit-
tee charged that one policeman
was assaulted by a student, but
the police records state that the
man actually suffered from ex-
haustion.

The double showing proved
that it is essential to see both
ﬁlms before deciding if there
was any wrong-doing at the hear-
ings, and if there was, by which
side. Both ﬁlms try to identify
villians, although “Operation Cor-
rection” seems to have paid a

little closer attention to time se-’

quences and facts. There is little
doubt as to which ﬁlm should
be believed.

Mickey Rosborough enjoys what he

There’s not much else to ask of a tight end.
Yet Rosborough is the forgotten -man of Panther
football.

Last season as a junior he caught 32 passes
to supplement an attack that had Eric Crabtree
break virtually every Panther receiving record.
Rosborough was a spilt then. After two games at
tight end, he's made three catches for 26 yards.

There are two explanations for the discrepan-
cies. Bob Long now plays split end. The other is
simply that as a tight end Rosborough is a blocker
ﬁrst and a pass receiver second. 8 -

His blocking assignments couldn’t be readily
distinguished from those of a tackle. He pass
blocks, he slips downﬁeld to lead sweeps, he helps
double team the defensive tackle and sometimes
he tries to take care of the defensive lineman
-for himself.

“I get kidded all the time in practice,” Rosbor-
ough says. “The players call _me a tackle and they
chase me out of the passingdrills.”

End coach Frank Cignetti doesn't consider Ros-
borough a tackle. But he does consider him one
of the most unselﬁsh players on the squad. “He’s
playing tight end because hecan most help the
team at that position,” says Cignetti.

Rosborough says he doesn't mind not getting

thrown to as long as the team's moving. “Wh-en‘

we move upﬁeld on a. 15 yarder to Bobby (Longo),
it's ﬁne with me.” Then Rosborough cracks, “It
makes me want to catch the ball when it comes
in my direction.”

‘ In his new position, he doesn't have to wait
for that pass to be thrown to get involved in the
action on . the ﬁeld. “A split end,” Rosborough

V notes, “can't relax until he catches the ball for

help out on the offensive blocking assignments.
He was the split end last year.

the ﬁrst time. But as the tight end‘, you hit some-

body right away.”

The ﬁrst two games provide evidence that
Rosborough and the rest of the offensive line have
been hitting. Quarterback Eddie James has had
time to throw and frequently throw long.

“I drop back to block,” Rosborough says, “us-
ually to give Eddie extra time to throw deep. 00
casionally I’ll sneak downﬁeld to provide him
with a safety valve.

“Last year,” hecontinues, “the defenders were
forced into man for man coverage on Eric, Mitch
(zalnasky), and myself. This year Skip (Orzulak)
and Bobby are both deep threats and then there’s
me.” -
The Panthers attempted to force that same
type of coverage achieved last season by split-
ting Rosborough out on selected plays in the sec-
ond half against Duke. That new wrinkle in the
attack seemed to ‘help the offense but it didn’t
result in Rosborough hauling in the football. the
way he used to.

Writers covering the Syracuse game last year
considered Rosborough the ﬁnest looking pro pros-
pect on the field, including Floyd Little. Now, of
course, the scouts see him on the line. They see
his lanky 210 pounds single blocking a. defensive
tackle.

“I’m sure the scouts recognize that I’m not go-
ing to be a tight end in the pros,” grins Rosbor-
ough. “I’m just as sure that our running attack
is going to stay away from that hole I'll be trying
to open on the defensive tackle.”

That’s_ Mickey Rosborough. He's the guy who's
sacriﬁcing a great pair of hands to help the Pan-
ther. football ‘team in other ways, uncelebrated
ways. And even if his proliﬁc pass receiving days

I are over, he won't miss them. “I’m having fun,"

says the Mouse. “And I’ll catch my share before
the season’s over." -

Booters’ Play Geared To NCAA’s,
Another Crack At West Chester

 

By MIKE BROURMAN
It is not often that a team
gets .a chance to avenge a

defeat prior to that prover-
bial “Wait till next year.” Even
though they are not scheduled to
play West Chester again, the soc-
cer team intends to meet the
Rams again, and they intend to
avenge their 2-1 defeat of last
Saturday.

There is only way this meet-
ing can be arranged, and it is up
to the booters to arrange it. They
are sure that West Chester will
be in the eastern regionals of the
NCAA, and they intend to be

NCAA’s. They made it last year
with virtually the same team
they have now. For the booters,
reaching the championship will
be a much harder task. .It means
they must win practically every
game they play. A 8
The task starts this week, and‘
it starts with a. team regarded
by many as the top soccer out-
ﬁt in the nation, Michigan State.
But the soccer team, although
impressed, is not awed. “I don't
even want to wait until Saturday.
I want to play them right now,”
said captain Art Richardson. I

o‘us attitude for a losing team to
take "it is understandable _in the

outplayed. They conrtolle'd the
action most of the time, and got
twice as many shots as the Rams.

Thus, it was that a losing
cause might have made an even
better booters team. As fullback
Jim Snyder commented, “After
losing this game, I didn’t think
I’d ever be able to get up for a
game again, but I’m already get-
ting up.”

football hasn’t seen any real twin stars since the McKeevers A
played at USC in 1959. Dave Hart and his coaches ‘have
brought to this year’s freshman football squad a pair of

guards who mirror each other.

Well, not exactly. Mike Man-
cuso is a quarter inch taller, and
ﬁve pounds heavier at 6-4 and
205 pounds than his younger (by
ten minutes) brother Dave.

Although Notre Dame, West
Point, and Penn State, among
others were after the Mancusos,
Hart and assistant recruiter Torn
Richards‘ wrested them out of
Monongahela High where they
helped post a 16-0-1 .WPIAL rec-
ord in their last two seasons.
Even though the boys signed to-
gether, they hadn’t planned to
attend the sa.me school originally.

“My brother decided ﬁrst,” said
Dave,_ “and the trip here con-
vinced me. Also Dave Hart help-
ed and the recruiter (Richards)
and the school helped. Going to
school together saves Mom and
Dad a. lot of trouble.” Both agreed
that Hart sold them on the po-
tential of football at the Univer-
sity.

The twins’ attitudes on foot-
ball are as identical‘ as their
faces. Both like playing offense,
but they also enjoy defense. Mike
ﬁgures there will be more oppor-
tunities to play offense next year.
Dave gets a “kick out ofmoving
down the ﬁeld with your team
on offense,” and adds that there
is less pressure than on defense
where “’a guy runs by you and
all the people know it.”

COACH DAVE HART
Keeps Eye on Twin Mancusos

Texas all stars last summer. That
was high school; this is college.

The person keeping the closest
tabs on the two brothers is fresh-
man coach Steve Petro. He hint-
ed that besides playing guard,
the Mancusos would be tried at
tight end. Petro added, “Mike, al-
though he didn’t get Dave's publi-

In two games, they have scored
only 21 points, but have man-
aged to compile 629 total yards.
The air game accounts for 416‘
yards, but along the ground, the
runners have managed only 213
yards.-

Saturday, once more the Pan-
thers head westward, this time
to Berkeley and the Golden Bears
of California. Relying on the arm
of quarterback Eddie James, the
Panthers may replace the zero
by a one in the win column. In
order to open the Bears’ defense,
however, James needs help from
the ball carriers.

Although James has called on
tailback Deewy Chester more
than anyone else (28 attempts),
he says he has no preference.
Chester’s 89 yards leads the team

E‘ in rushing. -

Second and third are fullbacks
Mike Raklewicz, 15 carries for 55
yards, and Joe Jones, 46 yards
on 11 attempts. Chester holds the
longest run from scrimmage, 17'
yards against UCLA.

Dr. Hassouna, an Egyptian Ph.D.
candidate in the Graduate School

fairs, began work on the “roll”
under the Research

burgh Board of Education. His

trional value of school breakfast

eral Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity. ‘ .

“The children were getting lit-

30 cents for each child, the meals
consisted of frosted ﬂakes, milk

The yummy rolls, now in 17

_ Using a Middle Eastern pastry‘
as a model, Dr. Waﬁk Hassouna,
,' M.D., baker, composer, and musi-
, cian, has developed the “yummy
 roll,’’ a breakfast food to be used

of Public and International Af--

Vann Schools. Eighty-ﬁve per
cent of the children enjoyed the
tuna, peanut butter, meat, and
chicken ﬂavored rolls.

At ﬁrst, Dr. Houssana called
his product the “High Protein
Biscuit” until he was advised
against the formidable name. “In
Egypt a biscuit is a cookie,” said
Dr. Houssana. “This just shows
the differences between cultures.”

The roll was ﬁnally christened
by his daughter, who attends-
public school in Pittsburgh. When
asked by her father what she
called the roll, she said, “yum,_

Economic Opportunity.

Since the news of his product
became known, Dr. Hassouna has
been contacted by the Associated
Press, the New York Times,‘ the
Post - Gazette and other news
sources. The idea of the roll has
become quite popular because of
its possibilities for popular con-
sumption. As one Post-Gazette
reader mentioned in a Letter to
the Editor: “I can't wait to try
