The Sundae Flea Market, which first overtook Schenley Plaza on Sunday, will occur three more times through 
, the summer. The next market will be held on June 15. More than 40 vendors put their crafts on display. 3

“It’s gotten worse each
4 year,” said Eckenrode.
{Pitt police spokesperson
~ Ron Bennett was quick to point
"out that landlords must be more
involved if disruptions like stu-
dent parties are to be prevented
in the future.

Andrews said that he told his

Bennett’s assertion in-
formed the rest of the meeting
as Delaney, Bennett and the
four landlords in attendance
discussed how to reduce crime
and improve resident behavior
in South Oakland.

Much of the discussion fo-
cused on new ways to com-

. municate the consequences of

crimes" such as underage drink-

working. Police found prescrip-
in Andrews’
apartment but did not determine
its purpose.

Andrews accused Maas of
looking down on him and treat-
ing him like dirt. He told police
that she insulted his body odor

on Thursday.

Maas worked at the Wynd-

ing to student members of the
South Oakland community
because, as Delaney said, “the
plan that we have is not work-
ing.”

New ideas included taking
out ads in local media, talking
to the parents of students and
speaking to students‘ starting
with orientation.

f‘We need to advertise and
communicate,” said Delaney.

ofﬁcials meet to discuss consolidation

Wendy Goldstein / Staff Photographer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato propose a potential city-county consolidation to the House Urban Affairs Comrnittee May 28.

by Holden Slattery
Staff Writer _

For almost a century, the
city of Pittsburgh and Allegh-
eny County governments have
considered merging, but a new
committee led by Pitt Chancel-
lor Mark A. Nordenberg has
brought the discussion to an
end.

The possibility of a city-
county merge was ﬁrst consid-
ered in 1929 and, in fact, ap-
proved by a vast majority but
was stopped by a technicality
listed as a “printer’s error” in a
Citizen’s Advisory Committee
report.

Then, in 2006, Allegheny
County Chief Executive Dan
Onorato and Pittsburgh Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl designed a
committee to analyze and study
the idea of a consolidation

-anew. They chose Nordenberg

as chair of the committee.

The goal of this merger
would be to make government
more effective and efﬁcient,
thus improving the Pittsburgh
region and healing some of its
troubling economic woes.

As chair of the Citizens Ad-
visory Committee on the Ef-
ﬁciency and Effectiveness of
City—County Government, Nor-
denberg has played a signiﬁcant

role in communicating to local
ofﬁcials that city-county con-
solidation is now a necessity.
On April 3, the committee
released a detailed report that
discussed reasons to consoli-
date and listed other cities that
consolidated to ﬁx problems
similar to those Pittsburgh fac-
es. _
This past Wednesday, the
House Urban Affairs Com-
mittee, which was designed to
look into the implications and
feasibility of merging the two
governments, held a public
hearing on the proposed Al-
legheny County Consolidation
at Point Park University’s Law-

rence Hall.

Thomas Petrone, chairman
of the House Urban Affairs
Committee, said the goal of
the merger would be “to help
reduce the duplication of ser-
vices, which would help reduce
costs for members of both the
city and the county.”

Onorato and Ravenstahl
addressed the committee by
reading statements express-
ing their strong support of the
proposed merger, after which
they answered questions from
members of the House Urban
Affairs Committee.

Onorato emphasized that the
duplication of services makes

for less efﬁcient county and
city’ governments. He‘ said that
the city and county each have
a separate public works depart-
ment and a parks and recreation
department.

“There’s no reason to have
both of these departments,”
said Onorato.

He noted how several other
cities have merged with a sur-
rounding county in recent
years, but he said the city in a
situation most similar to Pitts-
burgh was Louisville, Ky.,
which ‘merged with Jefferson
County in 2000.

A merger is necessary to
accommodate the current de-

Consolidation, page 9

Delaney receptive to Oakland surveillance cameras

SempleFest, page 1

The possibility of reducing
South Oakland crime by plac-
ing surveillance cameras in
areas that experience burglar-
ies and grafﬁti was also raised
during the meeting.

Eckenrode asked Delaney
if police could place cameras
around South Oakland and
offered to have the cameras
placed on his properties.

“I’m worried about kids go-

ing home for Thanksgiving or
Christmas and their places get
robbed,” said Eckenrode.

He hopes that cameras would
deter or help catch the burglars
who strike during breaks as
well as the grafﬁti artists whom
he said he has “been ﬁghting
for years.”

Delaney was receptive to
the idea and said that the blue-
light emergency boxes and sur-

veillance cameras had not been
placed in South Oakland before
because the University doesn’t
own any property in the area.
“Student Government Board
has been entertaining‘ the idea
of getting more emergency call
boxes in South Oakland,” said
SGB president Sumter Link.
Link said he supportsthe in-
stallation of cameras in South
Oakland if property owners are

willing to have them placed on
their buildings.

Kelly Wawrzeniak, who

works with the committee as '

the community organizer at
the Oakland Planning and De-
velopment Corporation, said
that she will invite representa-
tives of SGB to attend the June
meeting.

Both Delaney and Eck-
enrode expressed interest in

meeting - with representatives
from SGB. Eckenrode said that
getting everyone in Oakland on
the same page will help prevent
crime in the area.

Link said that he wants SGB
to become involved in discus-
sions with the landlords and
Pitt police in the future.

“Some good has to come out
of this: the fact that we are com-
municating,” said Delaney.

Welsh room modeled after historic chapel

Welsh, page 1

the Welsh—inspired room, pat-
terned after the converted barn
Penrhiw Chapel found near
Cardiff, Wales.

The Welsh Room, located in
room 342, includes columnar
beams, milky walls and a door
with wrought—iron hinges.

Artifacts are displayed in a
case and include a Welsh hym-
nal, pottery, kitchen equipment
and a metal plaque inscribed in
Welsh.

Other furnishings include a
raised pulpit with a deacon’s
bench on either side, boxed
pews for ‘student seating and a
communion table to be used by
professors.

An oak clock, one of the
most important items found in a
Welsh home, is expected to ar-
rive and be placed opposite the
door in the next few weeks.

“The Welsh wanted their
own church, even if it was in a
barn. They wanted to worship
in their own way,” said Bruhns.

 

“[Penrhiw] Chapel said this in
a very plain and unpretentious
way.”

The concept committee
passed on manor house and
castle themes and opted for the
chapel design because of its im-
portance to community life in
rural 18th century Wales.

Chapels were not just places
of worship but also centers of
village social life and where
people learned to read and write
the language.

“It’s a simple and austere
copy of a 1700s Welsh cha-
pel,” said St. David’s Society’s
president Dave ‘Williams. “And
it turned out exactly how we
pictured it.”

Pittsburgh’s St. David’s So-
ciety members made up the
Welsh Room committee, the or-
ganization devoted to memori-
alizing its Welsh heritage. They
proposed the idea of a new Na-
tionality Room in 2001.

Between then and now,‘ the

mographics in the region, which have
changed as people have continuously
moved from the city of Pittsburgh
to other municipalities in Allegheny
County, said Onorato.

“Today, 75 percent of Allegheny
County lives outside of Pittsburgh,”
said Onorato. Yet our government hasn’t
adjusted to the population swings that
have occurred in the last 50 years.”

Ravenstahl said his ﬁrst inclination
was to oppose the idea of a merger but
that he later changed his mind.

“What we’ve been doing for decades
has not been working,” said Raven-
stahl.

“We cannot simply get through to-

Onorato said that by studying Louis-
ville’s merger he has learned that in this
merger there will be hurdles and grow-
ing pains.

“But even with these growing pains,
no one in these counties ever says we
should go back to the way it used to
be,” said Onorato.

sell this.”'

Onorato said he is working to pass a
law to allow for this consolidation. If it
is passed, it must be approved by both
Pittsburgh City Council and Allegheny
County Council. Then the voters will
ultimately decide, he said.

Onorato’s goal is to make the con-
solidation a referendum for voters to
decide onnin the November 2009 elec-

tion.

Members of the House Urban Affairs
Committee expressed doubt about the
feasibility of achieving the consolida-
tion so rapidly.

John Maher, R—Upper St. Clair, said
he was not convinced that a year from
now government ofﬁcials would be able
to persuade the 129 municipalities in
Allegheny County outside of Pittsburgh
to go along with the plan.

Maher and other committee mem-
bers expressed concern that these mu-
nicipalities might be forced to take on
the city of Pittsburgh’s ﬁnancial debt
under the plan.

“I think we’ve got a lot of work ahead
before the referendum,” said Maher.

Maher also said that in Louisville the
process of consolidating took 20 years
after a consolidation compact was cre-
ated in 1996.

EDITORIAL V 

 Oban1a- Clinton t

might not be a dream

The long, drawn-out Demo-
cratic primary process has ﬁ-

I nally come to a close, as the

last two states, South Dakota

- 3 and Montana, cast their votes

.yesterday and superdelegate

jendorsements slowly ﬁltered

1n.

While Sen. Barack Obama
closed in on the Democratic
nomination, his rival, Sen. Hil-

‘ lary Clinton, told colleagues
, that she would consider run-
lning alongside him -as vice

president.

As reported by the Associat-
ed Press, Clinton expressed her
thoughts on being vice presi-
dent during a conference call

— with fellow New York lawmak-
ers with the stated hope that it
would help the sorely divided
Democratic Party in Novem-
ber’s general election.

Throughout the protracted
primary process, questions
of race, gender and experi-
ence have split and bruised the
Democratic Party. According to
ABC News, exit polls taken in
six out of the last seven prima-
ries have shown that at least 60
percent of Clinton supporters
would be unsatisﬁed if Obama
won the nomination. About
one-third of Clinton supporters
in South Dakota and Montana
said they would either vote for,
Republican Sen. John McCain
or stay at home rather than cast
the ballot in favor of Obama.

As divided as the Democrats
‘are, however, an Obama-Clin-
ton “dream ticket” is not neces-
sarily the solution to unity.

Since its inception, Obama’s
campaign has been based on
change, on splitting from the
corrupt and dated status quo of

Washington. It has been about 
turning away from the legacy 
of the big government regimes 

of Bush and Clinton.
If Clinton were a vice presi-
dential candidate, she would

bring to Obama’s fresh cam— ‘

paign of change years and years
of baggage from her life in poli-
tics.

Clinton and Obama each
seem to represent different

sides of the Democratic Party. '

A joint ticket would forcibly
bring these two polarizing ﬁg-

‘ ures together and would high-

light their dissirnilarities, not
their individual strengths.

An Obama—Clinton ticket
would not be a ticket of change
but rather a ticket of compro-
mise. '

Both Obama and Clin-
ton have campaigned hard to
achieve the nomination, neither
of them willing to concede un-
til every last vote was counted.
Both candidates are hungry for
power, bothsee themselves as
independent and inﬂuential po-
litical forces. Are two people
who have spent the last several
months criticizing and differ-
entiating themselves from each
other able to set aside their dif-
ferences and pull their party to-
gether? A

Unity is possible, but not
with a joint ticket. Latching on
to Obama’s victory will not help
the Democrats in November. If
Clinton is "serious about unit-
ing the Democrats, she should
abandon desires to be vice pres-
ident. Instead, Clinton should

"endorse Obama, campaign for

him and encourage her support-
ers to vote for the Democrats in
the general election.

Congestion pricing oﬂers solutions for traﬁic and city ﬁnance woes

 
    

by Lewis Lehe V

With summer approaching, we
should ask ourselves: Would you
rather go to Kennywood for free
but have to wait two hours for ev-
ery ride? _

‘ One advantage of a price sys-
tem, where people pay for what
they use, is that it prevents over-
crowding. Kennywood is obvi-
ously better off charging money
for admission. What’s interesting
is that the visitors are also better off
when they have to pay.

Pittsburgh can learn from Ken-
nywood. Every day, commuters
waitin near-endless lines to get
into the city. But if we took tolls for
the bridges, tunnels and highways

- leading into the city, we could raise

public funds andisave commuters
their precious time.
T'hat’s a good idea, but one ca-

.veatcanmakeitagreatideaThe
’ toll should vary by hour according
to how much trafﬁc congestion is‘

on the road at a given time. At rush
hour, the toll would be highest. On
weekends or other times when it’s
the speed limit — not other cars ——
that limits how fast you drive, there

This system is called conges-
tion pricing, which I call CP to

save characters. It’s an idea from.

economists William Wckrey and
Maurice Allais, who both won the

. Nobel Prize.

The justiﬁcation is that people
should pay for inconveniencing

others. In the case of road conges— T

tion, that’s the delay I cause other
drivers when I get on an already
crowded road The problem is that
when I get on a crowded road, I
only consider my own time wasted
in trafﬁc, not the additional time
other people will now have to waste
because of my choice.

The size of the toll changes
because the extent to which addi-
tional drivers worsen trafﬁc delays
depends on how much trafﬁc is al-
readyontheroadlfthereisonecar
on the road, and I get on, obviously
we can both still go the speed limit.

But ifI get on an already crowded

road, I waste a small piece of every
driver’s time. Spread ‘over many
drivers, the cumulative inconve-
nience can be cosﬂy, so I ought to
pay for it.

The biggest advantage of CP
is less congestion; Drivers travel
farther in less time. London imple-
mented congestion pricing for a 37

speed. We should care for eco-
nomic and environmental reasons
but also because gridlock is really
depressing. Economics Nobel win-
ner Daniel Kalmman found com-
muting ranks last on people’s scale

of activities ﬂrey enjoy, and short,
_ ‘commutes are strongly related to
one’s happiness. Like Harvard psy-

chologist Daniel Gilbert explains in
the Wall Street Journal, “Driving in
uafﬁc is a diﬁerent kind of hell ev-
elyday-” ..

Flexible prices distinguish CP
from traditional tolling. A ﬁxed
toll probably just lowers the num-
ber of people driving into the city.
On the other hand, CP varies with
congestion, so it encourages people
to change when they drive. With
traffic spread over time, the ﬂow
is more efﬁcient, so the total num-
ber of tripsinto the city doesn’t fall
much or might increase: Think how
50 people in a line can walk through

a door faster  ﬁve people wrig- «

gling through at the same time.

p When we ﬁrst hear about trafﬁc
lessening, we wonder what those
drivers will do instead. That’s be-
cause our own imaginations are
smaller than the cumulative imagi-
nations of people all familiar with
their own situations. We can trust,

On May 15, President George
W. Bush delivered a speech before
the Israeli Parliament on the 60th
anniversary of Israel’s indepen-
dence that has reignited a debate in
this country over how to conduct
diplomacy not only in the Middle
East but also around the world.

Bush’s identiﬁcation of those
who would speak with “terrorists
and radicals” as individuals who
indulge in the “false comfort of
appeasement” was seen by many
in this country as a veiled attack

. on Sen. Barack Obama and his
pledge to talk not only to our allies‘

but also to our enemies and rivals.
Not only are Bush’s comments
on appeasement deeply hypocriti-
cal, they are also shortsighted and
embarrassingly narrow-minded.
This "is, after all, the president
who sent Assistant Secretary of
State James Kelly and then Chris-
topher Hill to conduct the six—par-
ty talks in Beijing in a successful

 
 

secure relationship between North

, Korea and its neighbors.

This-was diplomacy at its best,
and it was conducted with a nation

_ that sponsors terrorism, possesses

nuclear weapons and ardently op-
poses U.S. national interests.

Diplomacy proved itself a suc-
cessful tool of achieving foreign
policy goals in the case of the ‘six-
party talks, so whyfis it not being
used in the Middle East?

History has shownzthat even:
the most intractable terrorist con-

ﬂicts founded on the injustices of
hundreds of years can be solved
successfully through engagement

The perfect example is the 

Northern Irish peace process
which tackled a sectarian conﬂict
involving multiple nations, terror-
ist organizations and seven centu-
ries of animosity. A power-sharing

‘arrangement was reached in the

1998 Good Friday Agreement
only after all the parties involved
sat down together with a U.S.
mediator and contact with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and

The Good Friday Agreement 1

has held up for 10 years, and today

- a successful power-sharing gov-
ernment exists in Northern Ireland
where once the only engagement
between Protestants and Catholics
was through violence.

But rather than attempt to rep-
licate such successful diplomatic
efforts in achieving peace in the
Middle East, Bush has sought to
score political points with his last
supporters: Zionists who view-the
Bible as a real estate document
and are unwilling to reach any ter-

‘ ritorial comprorriise with Palestin-
ians.

. What Bush’s speech signaled
was that a meaningful peace pro-
cess cannot begin until he is out of
ofﬁce and his inﬂuence is no lon-
ger felt in the region.

I The peace talks that Bush held
at-Annapolis in November went
nowhere because Bush allowed

thority who refused to hand over

power in free and fair elections
last June, is just one more dicta-
tor in the mold of Egypt’s Hosni
Mubarak or Pakistan’s Pervez
Musharraf. Negotiating with him
carmot be considered engagement
with the Palestinian people.

True engagement in the Middle
East will take courage, for it will
require that the United States and
Israel sit down and hold discus-
sions with Hamas and Iran.

In such discussions it will be‘

impossible to rely on the rhetoric
of good‘ vs. evil. Instead, it will
have to be recognized that Hamas
and the government of Iran repre-
sent real people with real griev-
ances. I

It is a hopeful sign that Israel is
engaging Syria in peace talks, and
it is equally positive that France is
opening contacts with Hamas. But
in order to establish peace in the
Middle East it will take’the active

involvement of the next president
of the United States not as a parti-
san for Israel but rather as a_ force
for change.

 

r

And that is why Obama must
not be derided as an agent of ap-

peasement but rather as a man-

witli the courage to abandon the
shallow comforts of a militant for-
eign policy for the nuance of inter-
national diplomacy. I

It took courage for Tony Blair
to sit down with terrorists in Bel-

fast in 1998, and it took courage ~

for the United States to enter into
talks with North Korea.

But rather than display such
fortitude in the Middle East, Bush
has found it‘easier to retreat behind
a wall of rhetoric impenetrable by
shades of gray.

In his speech to the Knesset,
Bush described a Middle East 60

» years from now that, overall, “will

be characterized by a new period
of tolerance and integration.” This
is a dream that we can all share, but

_we‘must realize that such a future

will not be achieved at the barrel
of a gun but instead through close
cooperation and understanding
that must start with engagement.

happiness is a constant struggle.
There are people who go through
life with many different worries.
Like, how am I going to pay for
my children to go to college?
When will these gas prices get
lower? Can the economy get any
worse? How am I going to get a
job? Many people make them-
selves miserable worrying about
these things.

Except for conservatives.

In a provocative new study,
researchers from New York Uni-
versity have found evidence that
supports a 2006 PEW Research
Center survey. The survey showed
that 47 percent of conservative
Republicans describe themselves
as “very happy” while only 28
percent of liberal Democrats de-
scribe themselves similarly.

An article from LiveScience
ﬁnally cites the all-important
reasons why conservatives are

on measures of rationalization.

. They were best able to “explain

away” inequalities in our country.
Liberals tended to be “frustrated
and disheartened” by gaps in eco-
nornic status. The study was_un-
able to determine whether or not
Libertarians have emotions. That
last line, by the way, was a joke.

Conservatives who are reading .

have probably already written olf
the study as “biased.” After all,
it was done at “a college” in “a
city.” We all know what kind of
stuff goes on there. Liberals who
are reading might be smiling at
these results. The proof of their
unhappiness is perhaps making
them happier. As an admitted lib-
eral, I snickered about the results
of this study. At ﬁrst.

Then I actually thought about
it. What does this have to say
about us on both sides? Is it really
the case that half of the country is
out of touch and happy? That the
other half is depressed over the
struggles? of mankind? Maybe it’s

the case that studies like this one

At Rove event at Pitt ear-

the College Republicans were. A
group of white young men wear-
ing suits and Americanﬁag lapel
pinssat in the front of the room. I
quickly identiﬁed them as the Re-
publicans. And patriots. I knew
that because of the lapel pins.

A group. of students near the
back of the "room sporting Obarna
stickers as if Rove was Barack’s
presidential competition were
easily identiﬁed as the Democrats.
They weren’t wearing lapel pins,
so I can only assume they were
also members of Harnas.

 

By now conservatives and lib—.

erals know ‘where the other side
stands on the issues. What conser-

know, is who is statistically more

enough conservative humor, if
there is any. I’ve only heard ru-

p . After-four long
 years of anticipation,
. I-IBO’s fan favorite
___/ " “Sex and the City”

has- ﬁnally made the

jump from television to ﬁlm. The
four ladies of the series reunite on

 

the big screen this summer for the V

eagerly awaited movie version of
the esteemed show.

The girls are back — along V

with'7-their men, Manolos and, of
course, Manhattan. Although the
story is clearly centered around the
lives of the four leading ladies, it

is the addition of these three things ‘

— theirboyfriends and husbands,
their exquisite designer outﬁts and
shoes and their adored city — that
add ﬂavor to the lives of the wom-
en by fueling feuds,-controversy,
excitement and pleasure. _

Although the ending proves to
be more—or-less predictable, it’s
the tumultuous journey that each
woman endures that cinches the
ﬁlm’s success_by simultaneously

stimulating emotional highs and

lows with its charm and honesty.

 

The ﬁlm places considerable
importance on the fact thatreach
woman has matured individually
since their last » on-screen esca-
pades. p_

The ‘show’s main gal and

.voice—over narrator, Carrie Brad-

shaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), is
still happily with Mr. Big (Chris
Noth). The twosome decide to
take the leap into shared real estate
as Big surprises his lady with a
penthouse suite — complete with
an enormous custom—made walk-

the simple proposal soon escalates
to full-blown drama as wedding
plans become extravagant and un-

As faithful fans rode copilot

- with Carrie through her roller

coaster of trials and tribulations
on the show .—- through hook—ups
and break-ups, extreme highs and
lows — the movie captures the
audience’s attention right away,
shedding light on the happiness

But without the hard times,
there are no lessons to be learned,

in the show’s footsteps as each
woman eventually learns some-

comes enlightenment.

Superstar Chesney searches
or the next country star

by Tony J ovenitti
Staff Wrder

 

Before the stage is set up on
Heinz Field and 65,000 scream-
ing country music fans ﬁll the
stadium, four local bands -must
compete for the chance to open
for country music star Kenny
Chesney.

The ticket stubs might say
“Kenny Chesney at Heinz
Field,” but he is only one-sixth
of the entertainment June 14. In
addition to his four accompany-
ing acts — Luke Bryan, Gary
Allan, LeAnn Rimes and Keith
Urban —— Chesney is offering
up the lead-off spot to a local

band, which he cleverly calls
his “Next Big Star,” named for
his hit song “Big Star.”

The competition will take
place on the eve of the show at
the Hard Rock Cafe in Station
Square, where four bands will
duke it out to play in front of a
sold out Heinz Field.

“Chesney decided to offer
up this opportunity to up-and-
coming bands to give them an
opportunity to play in front
a large audience,” said Roy
Smith, Sales and Marketing Di-
rector for the Hard Rock Cafe.

According to BNA Records,
Chesney has considered this for
years.

“If someone came into
Chucky’s Trading Post— or
even the Turf in Nashville —
and given me the opportunity
to win a shot to open for Keith
Whitley, I’d’ve died. I don’t
want anybody dying, I just want

to help get them a little closer to
the dream,” said Chesney in the
press release from BNA.

The contest began on Tues-
day, when Y108 announced
10 ﬁnalists_. Listeners and fans
have until Friday to log onto
y108.com, listen to the ﬁnalists
and casttheir vote to determine
the top four bands. _

' There is also a national con-
test among all the local win-
ners from each tour date. The
grand-prize winner will hop on
the “Poets & Pirates” tour bus
for the ﬁnal weekend of the tour
and perform in Tulsa, Okla., St.
Louis, Mo., and Indianapolis,
Ind., with Chesney.

According to Y108, there
will also be a $25,000‘ cash
prize and an audition with
Sony/BMG for the grand-prize
winner.

Chesney has always tried
to give as much as possible to

“This isn’t about me. It’s
about the fans, and giving them
their own piece, of the dream.
Being able to do this is maybe
the biggest rush of all,” said
Chesney.

 Forget the movies, have a real summer adveture .

by Anton Skerl
Staﬂ Wrrler

Now that Mother Nature is ﬁ-
nally done toying with our sensitiv-
ity to extreme cold in late spring,
we can ﬁnally believe that this
summer could be a toasty one.

Football players can toss the
pigskin around ﬂue park, sorority
sisters can catch some rays on the
Soldiers & Sailors lawn and Ven-
ture Outdoors can unleash their
activities in full swing.

Students still residing off cam-
pus, stuck in summer classes or
spending their time in the dull
working world, can take part in
some of the organization’s sched-
uled activities, ranging from kaya-
king to a wine and cheese hike — a
little something for everyone’s
taste, so to speak.

While’ most of the activities
are open to all of Pittsburgh, some
are exclusive to Venture Outdoors
members — a nominal yearly fee
of $12 for students and $24 for in-
dividuals, with deals on dual- and
full-house packages for the family.
The memberships offer up to 50

percent in discounts for trips, mer-
chandise and activities for all ages
and .levels of expertise -—_ so don’t

lot of themed events like [the] wine
and cheese hike, and in the fall
there’s a soup of the monﬂr hike.”

Many events revolve around
biking, kayaking and hiking, show-
ing Pittsburghers that the steel city
is more than meets the eye. Some
events, like the South Side Slopes
New Moon Hike, test endurance
while showing oﬁ° the city. Partici-
pants can snake their way across
six miles of steep stairs and terrain
along the Slopes, guided by the
light of the new moon —— romantic,
no?

Lingren noted that the armual
Kayak Pittsburgh event sees its fair
share of rowdy Pitt students enjoy-

.ing a leisurely paddle.

“Pitt is one of the largest groups

who came out for kayak Pittsburgh.
Over 100 attended, the largest group
of any school,” said Lingren.

try the old “I don’t know how to do Another popular event is a

Pittsburgh. He came with a force of
seven thousand men, so our hope’s

us for the Great Allegheny Run.”
The event happens to be on the
same night as the Festival of Lights.

The Great Allegheny Run will have ,

While the ofﬁcial start of sum-

For devout fans, the ﬁlm might
fall short of the hard-to—exceed
expectations secured by the se-
ries during its six-season run on
television.

Throughout its run, there was
never a dry spell of wit, surprise,
humor and drama from week to
week —- the show always per-
forrnedwithgreatsatisfaction.Each
episode intoxicated viewers with
30 minutes packed full of adven-
tures —- sometimes unbelievably
hilarious and always endearing.

The transfer to‘ the big screen
for this guilty pleasure affords
loyal fans one last glimpse into the
lives of the ﬁerce foursome, and al-
though it might not reach the peak
that it did on air, it successfully
transports viewers back into the
escapades of their favorite ladies.

The movie is captivating, and

although it is lengthy at two hours
and 20 minutes," it holds interest
throughout. Each event introduces
something new, and loose ends are
left untied until the very end. The
length works because the resolu-
tion ﬁnally affords closure to the
lives of each character, and for this
reason, never becomes overbear-
ing.
It will make you laugh, it will
make you cry, but most important-
ly, it will make you feel good. The
enchantrnent of the show makes a
seamless transition to ﬁlm by ﬁll-
ing in all the blanks from where
the series left off while adding
new developments as well.

Reurriting with the ladies
turns out to be quite bittersweet
— catching up with them is in-
deed wonderful, but tainted with
sadness, knowing this is ﬁnally
the end of the road, and we will
always want more “Sex and the
City.”

The following is completely
ﬁctional and is not ‘to be taken
seriously.

Pirates president Frank

goonelly ﬂicks on the lights of

bowels of PNC Park. He and
general manager Neal Hunt-
ingdon look around the room
and cringe at the carnage. On.
the wall, individually framed,
are portraits of Pirates’ former
ﬁrst-round draft picks...

Neal Huntingdon: My god,
the smell! ' -

stink.

NH: But  but what hap-
pened?

I don’t know. Luckily, neither
you nor I have to lay claim to
these mistakes. You never knew

understand. Come to think of it,
I knew him, and I still don’t un-
derstand; . _

NH: All these pitchers?
There are so many of them!

FC: I know.’ It’s a shame,
really. Seven out of the last 10
years our Pittsburgh Pirates

organization drafted a pitch- _

ing prospect. One of the other
three was an NCAA home run
champ who closed in college.
They turned him into a starter.
We know the -rest.

NH: (Walks over to portrait)
Poor John Van Benschoten. Hit
31 home runs when he was a ju-
nior in college. Led the NCAA.
Now look at the ominous 8.78
major-league ERA over his
head.

FC: Not to mention the mess

‘of tendons in his left shoulder.

You see, Neal, this is why I
brought you down here. Clin-
ton Johnson.‘ Bobby Bradley.
Bryan Bullington. All former
ﬁrst-rounders. You know Bul-

all in 2002 ahead of B.J. Upton,
Prince Fielder, Jeff Francoeur
and Scott Kazmir. _

NH: He’ll be 28 in the fall

FC: Ahead of Nick Swisher,
Cole Hamels, Khalil Greene,
Zach Greinke, James Loney -

NH:  and he was just re-
cently recalled from Triple-A.

FC: Neal, all these guys
here were projected as prizes
— what should have been the
fruits of years and years of los-
ing baseball. And nearly every
one of them broke down, faded
into obscurity or has very little
productive big-league future
ahead of him.

NH: Poor Brad Lincoln and
Danny Moskos. They have
to be just dying to be a trade
throw-in.

FC: At this point, Neal, who
wouldn’t? I mean, let’s be real
here. We’re at the top of the
ball club about to set the streak
for the most consecutive losing
seasons.

NH: (Shakes head) But Paul
Maholm and Sean Burnett were
ﬁrst-round picks and are with
the club now. Paul’s one of our
best starters. Sean .has- great
potential. And I guess Bryan’s
now going to show us if he has
anything left. 8

FC: True, and We’re very
thankful to have their talent and
production. But Bullington is
still a question mark, and Ma-
holm and Burnett are the only
two pitchers who appear to
have made it, Neal. You know
how volatile and fragile pitchers
can be, especially starters. What
Dave thought he was going to
do was stockpile pitching tal-
ent so when contending teams
needed pitching, he’d have a
monopoly on the market. But
most of these guys were duds,
now riddled by injuries with
their prime years behind them.
You know there’s no market for
duds, Neal.

- NH: But there is a market
for studs — like Andrew Mc-
Cutchen, Dave’s only unani-

wo men’s desire to cleanse Pirates of past failures

mously celebrated ﬁrst-round
draft pick. V
FC: Exactly. You can take

‘a high-risk, high-reward pros-

pect, but a position player with
a full box of tools" and proven
pop in his bat is much less like-
ly than a pitcher to break down
during his journey through the
minors. Neal, Tampa Bay, Ari-
zona, Milwaukee — this is what
these teams have been doing for
years. And now? Gasp! Suc-
cess! Coincidence? I think not.
NH: Well, Frank, We’re a
new club now, and it’s time to
prove it! Scott Boras and other
megadeal agent-sharks won’t
intimidate the lil’ ole’ Pirates
anymore. We’ll sign Pedro Al-
varez or Tim Beckham, no mat-
ter what it takes, and We’ll re-

build this organization from the
inside.

Gonchar, Malone ’s

health Vital for Game 6

' , Powerplay, page 20

But all of those things changed in Game
5. He made hits to stop a play and he took

' hits to start a play. Whitney didn’t score,

but he logged more than 50 minutes of ice
time and really picked up his defensive
play when the team needed him the most.

NL: Darryl Sydor’s performance in ,

Game 5 surprised me the most. He com-
mitted untimely giveaways and executed
poor reads throughout the majority of the
game.

From a guy with two Stanley Cup rings,

you need to be able to depend on him in *

crucial situations, and, by his play in Game
5, Michel Thertien cannot. '

‘-Who in particular needs to step up at
Game 6_ in Pittsburgh? .

JH: Tough call as'the team is really
starting to pick up its play, but I think Ev-
geni Malkin gets the nod here. He still isn’t
playing up to the level he did in the regular
season. I know we addressed this issue last
week, but for the Penguins to ﬁnally put on
a dominating performance, everybody has
to be running on all cylinders, and it has to
start with Malkin. _

NL: Not one individual but the whole
team. For the Pens to push this series to a
Game 7 in Detroit, the entire team needs to

‘ carry the same consistent intensity through

a.....4:'vn.7...; .1»... 4...‘.

three periods that we have seen in the prior
playoff series and in Games 3 and 5.

-Who has been Detroit’s best player
in the series? '

JH:v Goaltender Chris Osgood has‘

made some impressive saves in this series
and is high up there on the Conn Smythe
list. His stiﬂing 1.53 goals—against-average
and .931 save percentage has been no ﬂuke.
Osgood has made some robberies this se-
ries, especially when the Penguins needed
a goal most. -
NL: Osgood. The man is playing

incredi.bly~,~ gand,  experience is nearly .

unmat,ched." ‘He is if proving a lot of critics
wrong including myself and has shown he
can still be a dogninant force in this league.

 (1 5h9t.S‘ 0V9?" “l,_¢,,e;_.

at times. The number of shots by the Red
Vlrmgs is misleading as they play a different
brand of hockey -~ taking shots at anytime
from anywhere — and that can be tough
for a defenseman to block.

Stopping this trend, though, starts with
aggressive pressure in the neutral zone. »
Force the Red Wings to make 50-50 passes
and a solid backcheck by the Penguins can
signiﬁcantly slow down Detroit. '

NL: The solution comes down _ to
simple hockey. Getting shots on net with
trafﬁc in front can score a lot of goals. Take

the game-tying and game-winning goals _

scored by the Pens in»Game 5.

Max Talbot scored a garbage goal from
the side of the net with trafﬁc in front, and
on the game—winner, Sykora picked the top
comer with a Ryan Malone screen.

-How significant were the injuries to
Sergei Gonchar and Malone? V‘
JH: Losing those two guys was hard

.to watch, as they are both integral parts

of the power play — and it showed when
they went down. But hey, it’s the Stanley
Cup Finals. These guys are true warriors.
I’m still in shock that even after ﬂying
head ﬁrst into the end—boards (Gonchar)
and taking a slap shot to the face (Malone),
you saw these two guys on the ice in.over—
time. That’s the beauty — ironically —— of
the NHL playoffs.

NL: I think the Gonchar injury is more
signiﬁcant than the Malone, especially ‘af-
ter seeing Malone come back almost im—l
mediately. ‘ ‘

Gonchar was able to play on the power
play late into overtime, so that tells me with
the day off for rest before Game 6, he will
be in the lineup along with Malone.

-Bold prediction time...can the Pens
push it to 7 and win it? Or will Detroit
prevail in one of the last two games?
