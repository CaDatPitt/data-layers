Inla letter of transmittal to George Lynn, past president of‘
Student Congress, Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald, last monday morn-
ing, made known the University’s decision permitting political speak-
ers on campus but not “implying endorsement of the statements

The decision became a matter of oﬁicial policy May 3 when 17
deans met and passed a three division report on the political sub-
ject after deliberating for some six months.

. Under the policy division of the report, the deans said: “The
University of Pittsburgh, as a center of intellectual activity and as
an institution devoted to the education of young men and women for
citizenship, welcomes the full and free discussion of all matters of-
general interest, including political and other controversial issues.”

The only restraining hand on the open policy concerns the
“probable contribution of the proposed speech to the educational
program of the University” and the matter of speeches advocating

WSGA to Fill

Top Positions

In the hopes of giving all inter-
ested women an opportunity to
participate in committee work of
WSGA, encourages all interested
tive unit swings into the second
session of interviewing applicants
on Monday.

Interviews scheduled for the
Braun Room between 12:30 and
4:30 p.m., are open to coeds de-
sirous of holding chairmanships
and committee memberships next
year.

A second string of interviews is
slated for Tuesday, 11:3-0 a.m. to
3:30 p.m., same place.

Ginny Reynolds, president of
WSGA. encourages all interested
women to apply, keeping in mind
the proposed plan of action for
some respective committee.

The new executive is acting up-
on the suggestion of the out-going
executive that ‘finterviewing be
adopted as a method in the con-
sideration of new committee mem-

bers.”

‘served on Student Congress ex
officio as president of Men’s
Council. ‘

Vice President of the new Coun-
cil is James Lauble, a member of
Phi Kappa.

Bob Kauffman resumed his sec-
retary’s duties. He was unan-
imously reelected to the office he
ﬁlled last year. His activities in-
clude membership in Sigma A1-
pha Mu, Men’s Debate and Phi
Eta Sigma, freshman scholastic

The treasurership went to Carl
Angstrom, another incumbent,

Senior Representative to Stu-
dent Congress is Jack Barto, who
handled the Council ﬁnances last
term.

“No program, as yet, has been
planned for next year,” stated
President Thrasher.

violent overthrow of the govern-
ment. ' ~
The University also urges dis-
cussion of all sides of controver-
sial issues and orderly -behavior
in speech meetings. ' '
Under administrative provisions
of the report, the deans propose
the establishment of a six man

committee and‘ an assemblies ad- “

ministrator. The committee is
composed of two students, .two
faculty members and two admin-
istration heads. '

The seventh member of the
group, to act as administrator of
the policy and chairman of the
committee, is Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men.

Highlight of the “Principles” di-
vision of the report is contained in
the ﬁrst proviso stating that the
University will try to obtain,
above and beyond the efforts of
student organizations, “outstand-
ing public figures.” The University
plans to hold oﬁicial lecture and
discussion meetings periodically.

Announcement of the change in
University policy is the culmina-
tion of a series of events follow-
ing the requests of “Students for
Wallace” to bring Henry Wallace
to campus last November. Stu-
dent Congress, at that time, asked
for clariﬁcation of the official Uni-
versity decision. A

The Board of Deans held inter-
views with activities students and
with anyone interested in the mat-,
ter since that time. The official
statement released Monday is the
result of their work.

The 1947-48 Student Congress,
acting immediately, placed its for-
mal acceptance on the new policy
in behalf of the student body as
its last official act.

The policy goes into eﬁect at
the beginning of the fall term.

Diplomat Holt
Speaks Here

A last-minute announcement
from the dean of men’s office re-
vealed that the State Department’s
newest foreign service oﬂicer as-
signed to Berlin will speak here
Wednesday morning.

Dr. John B. Holt, until recently
a member of the Economics and
Manpower Commission working
with Military Government oiﬁcers
in Berlin, will discuss “The strug-
gle For Power In Germany” at
10:30 Wednesday morning, in Fos-
ter Memorial Hall.

Dean Theodore Biddle, who re-
leased the information, statedthat,
“Dr. Holt’s subject is one of the
most interesting and timely to be
presented here or anywhere else
in a long time. Although I realize
that preparation for examinations
and the warm weather are handi-
caps to attendance, it will beneﬁt
every, student who can attend to
hear what Dr. Holt has to say. He
left Germany just a few weeks
ago, and will return to Berlin
June 1. His knowledge of the sit-

uation is unrivaled on this side of”

the Atlantic.”

_the new policy will become so many meaning- .

I A Step Forward

After four months of discussions, hearings
and deliberations the committee of University
‘deans appointed to study the school’s policy
with regards to political speakers has handed
in its recommendations.

The report provides for a’ standing com-
mittee of students, faculty members and admin-
istrative officers to handle applications for
speakers and to pass on their ﬁtness. It also
recognizes necessity for political speakers as a
part of the college studen't’s education. As such
the report represents a deﬁnite advance over
past University attitudes in the matter.

Since the policy does not go into effect un-
til next September it is impossible to attempt
any valid evaluation or criticism at this time.
But it isn’t too early to discern that there
are a number of possible loopholes in the -plan.

Most of these loopholes center around the
discretionary power given to the administrative
officer in charge of the new committee. These
powers include the right to veto a speaker’s
appearance after consideration of such factors
as the probable contribution of the speech to
the educational program of the University, the
availability of adequate physical facilities and
the past record of the sponsoring organization
with regard to compliance with the policies and
principles of the University.

No one will deny that there are certain
speakers whose presence here is neither nec-
essary nor desirable. But‘ the loose wording

-of the report could well permit school officials

to deny time to qualiﬁed men who might be
considered undesirable by the University ad-
ministration.

Much will depend, therefore-, upon the judg-
ment of Dean of Men Theodore'W. Biddle, the
administrative officer in whose hands respon-
sibility has been placed. We can hope that
Mr. Biddle will view applications in the most
liberal light possible. Unless he does the entire
purpose of the program could be thwarted and

less words. i v

Not Much Time

The alumni and students have picked their
representatives for the new athletic commit-
tee. The letter men probably will follow?‘ suit
within the next week. i

That leaves only the faculty members. The
understanding was that the Chancellor would
hold off announcement of his choices until the
other positions on the board had been‘ﬁlled.
Well, that time has come and we trust that
there will be no further delay on the Chan-
cellor’s part. ‘

Throughout the months of investigations
and inquiries he has expressed his desire to
see the athletic problem solved. Speed now
is important. Only a fewweeks of school re-
main; only a few months until the new foot-
ball campaign starts.

During those months the new committee
must decide on an athletic policy and settle
the status of Athletic Director Jimmy Hagan
and Football Coach Mike Milligan.

If the past performances of University
Athletic Committees are any criteria, the new
body is going to need every minute of the
time between now and September.

NEW YORK, April 3 (UP)—Dr. Albert Einstein
today offered a theory that some scientists believe
may reveal most of the secrets of the universe. It
was his earlier theory of relativity that opened the
way for the atomic bomb and unlocked many mys-
teries of nature. —THE PITTSBURGH PRESS,
April 3, 1948. .

Thank you, Dr. Einstein, but no thanks. I can’t

whip up a feeling that comes close to elation. When -‘

the boys in the inner sanctums of science have
decided what your latest theory will mean to our
bright, new, post-Wor1d—War II world, I still won’t
clamor for any of the material results.

The lone tangible product of your theory
of relativity still scares the daylights out of
me. Even granting that the atomic bomb may
be progress of one sort or another, I somehow
or other can’t rouse myself to pen encomiums
to science.

Here I sit as an inﬁnitesimal part of the United ,
States holding the weapon over the rest of the .

world in somewhat the same manner that a dom-

‘ ineering father holds a yardstick over his toddling ;

son. But as the father sometimes has qualms in
anticipating the boy’s growing up and ‘pasting the
daylights out of him, I perspire freely when I think
of the scientiﬁc underdogs someday coming up
with an atomic missile of their own. So if you

haven’t anything better to show for your theory ;
, of relativity, let’s leave bad enough alone and '
. shelve your latest venture into cosmic abstrac-

tions.

, The scope of anything that could possibly
“reveal of the secrets of nature” is much too
broad for me. I’m satisﬁed to sit around in ig-
norance and ‘let nature go her "unpredictable
way without any interruption from my preco-
cious partners in that loosely knit organiza-
tion, “The Human Race.”

I can speak positively only for myself, but I’ll
wager several tomes on atomic structure that most
of my fellow creatures prefer an element of chance

1 in their association with nature. Knowing the sec-

rets of nature, we’ll know how to control nature
and that will take away what few little surprises
we have left in life.

If the new cosmic control apparatus hasn’t
come equipped with a lever that spreads a fac-
simile of Greenland’s ice cap over any nation
objecting to the whims of the United States,
it’ll be a mighty gay lazy-man’s world. Peo-
ple with access to the control board of the
machine will be set for lives of uninterrupted
indolence. I’ve met only a handful of people
who would like things that way.

Thanks, Dr. Einstein, but you’ll take my life
with a modicum of exertion. I appreciate your of-
fer ever so much and you probably mean very
well. My stock of gratitude for theories is rather
low this year; I do hope" you won’t be hurt.

 Disc Jockeys Team Up

To Introduce New Tune
Penned by Piffsburgher

Jerry Newberg

On Thursday: April 29 Gimbel’s department
store and many of Pittsburgh’s top disc jockeys
got together and introduced “My First Look At
Heaven” a romantic ballad written by two Pitts-
burgh boys Harry Kurtz and, Bill Marino. U

The program which took place at Gim-
bel’s record department was capable handled
by WWSW announcer and Pitt student Michael
Marlow. Among the DJ’s present were Al
Noble of KQV, Bill Brandt of KDKA, Pitt’s
Dan Mallinger of WPIT, Hilory Bogden, WJAS,
Jack Beattie and Carl Betz of WCAE and Ot-
to Krenn and Bettelou Purvis of WPGH.

It was certainly a very nice gesture on the part
of these disc jockeys to pool their efforts in intro-
ducing this sensational love ballad written by two
fellows who call the Smoky City their home.

The song is orchestrated by Ramon Littee,
the “Latin from Paree” and record is on an
Ansa. label. Taking the spotlight on‘ the vocal
is former Les Brown vocalist Ralph Young.
This boy is really great. Take a listen to the
tune and tell me if you think he sounds like
Vaughn Monroe.

Wax Wise ,

Putting in a bid for the popular “Nature
Boy” is Sinatra’s Columbia recording. Colum-
bia with a feeling that this number was pe-
culiarly qualiﬁed for a cappella recording, has
had Frankie boy singing the lyrics over a.
beautifully rendered mixed - voice vocal
group.

atra recording over a comfortable, medium-tempo
accompaniment by an instrumental trio featur-
ing John Guarnleri, Tony Mottola and Mickey Al-

lowance, a double standard exists‘
between full and part-time stu-
dents. A full-time student veteran
without dependents may receive
$75 subsistence allowance, with
one dependent he may receive
$105_; with two dependents he
may receive $120.

Ceilings on Total Earned in-
come for full-time students are
now $210, $270, and $290 respec-
tively for the above mentioned de-
pendent groups. The part-time
student may receive a subsistence
allowance to the extent of a part
of $65 without dependents, or
part of $90 with dependents.

Ceilings on total earned income

for part-time students are the ,

same as for full-time; that is,

‘$210, $270, and $290.

Mr. Ricart states that, “It is
interesting to note that full-time
students with two dependents
whose total earned income per
month is $290, really has an in-
come of $320 to $330 because he
pays no tax onthe portion of his
income he receives from the VA-
$120.

“It appears that the best way
to beat the high cost of living is
to become a full-time student
with a part time job, or enter into
an on-the-job-training program.”

Ofﬁcial recognition of Chi chap-

after the twenty-ﬁfth anniversary
of the founding of the chapter on
compus March 23, 1923.. _

Revitalization of the chapter
was instigated by the national
fraternity and carried out by in-

Pitt men were ‘initiated at Sigma
Pi’s Penn State chapter in March
and now form the nucleus of the
chapter.

William O’Brien, president of
the Pitt chapter, expressed the

All you have to do is point it in the right

Research Program Produces Technique
for Tapering Molten Nylon Bristles

Difficult mechanical problems
solved by Du Pont chemists
and engineers to make nylon
paintbrushes practicable

.,.
Nylon bristles used in toothbrushes and
hairbrushes are uniform in diameter-—
that is, they are “level.” But paint-
brushes made from such bristles did
not paint well. Studies of the best natu-
ral bristles showed that they were ta-
pered, so a research program to produce
tapered nylon bristles was started.

Some difﬁcult mechanical problems
were encountered. Level brush bristles
were being made by extruding molten
nylon through spinneret openings de-
signed to produce ﬁlaments of perfectly
uniform diameter. A new technique‘ had
to be found to make tapered ones. Since
it was not practical to taper the ﬁla-
ment after cooling and drawing, a pre-
cise taper had to be put in just as the
nylon emerged molten from the spin-
neret. And it had to survive the drawing
operation, in which nylon is stretched
to several times its original length!

Techniques originated in laboratory

The original idea forisolving this prob-
lem came from Du Pont chemists, who

worked out the techniques in the lab-
oratory, in the somewhat crude form
represented in the accompanying dia-
gram. It being largely a mechanical
problem, chemical and mechanical‘ en-
gineers were called in to cooperatesoon
after the studies got‘ under way. After
further laboratory development, the
engineers put the operation on a pro-
duction basis. '

The ﬁnal result was a highly efficient
process for tapering nylon bristles.IAs
the molten ﬁlament emerges from the
spinneret, pinch-rolls driven by a series
of gears. pull it slowly, then quickly.
The size of the ﬁlament varies with the
speed of pul1ing—thick diameters re-
sulting at slow speeds and thin diam-
eters at fast. Next the nylon goes to
the drawing operation, where it is
stretched by. rollers to give it strength
and resiliency.

Engineers designed special machines

Following spinning and drawing, in
which many ﬁlaments are handled si-
multaneously, the nylon is “set.” Then
it goes to a spebial machine, designed.
by Du Pont engineers, which “feels
out” the crests and troughs and cuts
the bristle at these points. This type of
design was necessary because of the un-
avoidable small variations in the length
of individual bristles. Sorting the bris-

tles and sandpapering their ends com-
pletes the process.

ll Many techniques contributed to the
development of the optimum properties
of nylon in tapered bristles. At the lab-
oratory stage, x-ray studies were made
to learn the effect of various degrees of
crystalization on bristle" drawing and
setting. Numerous devices were designed
to test the bristles-—for example, a ma-
chine that simulates the abrasive effect
on a brush swept back and forth over a

surface. Even after manufacture was ‘

established, high-speed stroboscopic
photography and other stroboscopic
studies were employed to improve co-
ordination in the various operations
and make a more uniform product.

The development of these bristles

T furnishes another striking example of

the great variety of problems, often

covery of a new substance like nylon.

‘ An overnight stay tonight at

trot out their undefeated record
against Penn State at the Lion
lair tomorrow afternoon.

The Nittany thinclads are top-
heavy favorites. In the middle-
distance and distance events, the
host team is superlative. Bill
Thomas and Mitch Williams in the
880, and Gerry Karver and Hor-
ace Ashenfelter in the mile and
two-mile, should score heavily.

Jim Gehrdes, Altoona hurdler
and high jumper, is a good bet for
ﬁrst place honors in both hurdles
races and the high jump.

All in all, it ‘looks like a dismal
afternoon for Carl Olson’s lads
and their heretofore undefeated

three remaining games will kill
Pitt’s chances for a .500 season.

That means the Mitterling pro-
teges must not only defeat Salem
but sweep a double bill from
slugger-packed West Virginia.

Such a feat is hardly likely,
but a noticeable improvement in

the play of the Panthers has pro-
vided a pinch of - hope. Second
baseman Joe Frankofgwhose chief
defense against ground balls used
to be his chest, has looked smooth
and steady in the ﬁeld.

Jackie Snyder has begun to give
the team a well-needed batting
punch, and Deryl Calder has re-
turned to his old-time pitching
form.

Although Calder pitched the last
game against W&J, he- will prob-
ably start again on Monday. Rudy
Hudec, Mitterling’s other front
line hurler, has been sent to right-
field in place of Jim Couch.

The Medical B’s as future MD’s
will be required someday to make
vital "decisions. So after a quick
diagnosis of the situation, Tues-
day at Trees ﬁeld, the ,Meds de-
cided to call off their softball
game with the Psi Omega at the
end of the ﬁfth inning. The Ome-
ga’s were ahead, 2110-1.

Likewise Psi Omega, as future
dentists, will be required to pound
the patient into insensibility be-
fore pulling. This they did to the
Meds, drilling out 21 hits before
they quit struggling.

Elmer ‘Lipp performed credit-
ably for the Omega’s, giving up
two hits in the four innings in
which he pitched. Joe Haller, who
hurled the last inning, allowed one
hit. I

 Tels
!ndia's Need

COLUMBUS, O. — India will
continue in its present pitiable
condition unless the country can
be ruled by a government devoted
to the Indian people. and not by
a government trying to exploit it,
declared Dr. E. B. Junkerman,
former faculty member of Ohio
State University, in a talk here in
which he told of his experiences
while serving eight months
India as a colonel in the U.S.
Army.

“When white men have gone
into foreign lands, they have al-
ways ruled the people ruthlessly
and barbarously,” he said.

The starvation of two million
Indians during the Bengal famine
in 1943 was not due to a shortage

‘of food, Dr. Junkerman stated.

The government had collected,
stored, and held for high prices
large quantities of grain, which
were later destroyed, according
to him.

While in Calcutta, the ex-col-
onel said he saw skilled laborers

striking for $13 a month income.

They were earning only $3.60 per
month, he explained.

Everyone he met in India, Who
could read and write, or who had
gone to secondary schools, had re-
ceived part of his education in a
missionary school, Dr. Junker-
man asserted.

Nine chairs and a table,
rented by Spring Festival for
the Carnival last week from
the Dowd Chair C0,, are miss-
ing. It is believed that they
were accidentally included
among some of the furniture
brought by campus organiza-
tions participating in the Car-.
nival. All such groups are ask-
ed to check their furnishings
for Dowd trademarks and re-
port to the dean of men’s office
as soon as possible.

in,

‘of plunging from a luxurious ho-
tel into a dishpan is almost more
than a newly-made marriage can
bear.” ‘

~Al1 the women, however, are
agreed on one point: “It’s not the
place she goes nor how she trav-
els that makes her honeymoon
perfect for a woman — it’s THE
MAN.”

Most women advised what NOT
to do. Among their warnings were
the following: ’

“Don’t take a sea trip if it’s the

a swanky resort if you can’t
