But some
residents say

no dice

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

(Editors note: This is the third in a
three-part series on student gambling
at Pitt. )

Gambling bookkeepers in the resi-
dence halls will likely have at least
one more year of monopoly, as legal-
ized gambling for Pittsburgh seems
to be a dead issue.

At least until 1996, when it will
possibly be up for a state—wide vote,
according to Pittsburgh lawyer
Jonathan McAnney, who specializes
in gaming law at Tucker Amsberg, a
downtown law firm.

“The momentum we had in 1994

Casinos could sail along the Allegheny

Ridge administration did not make
legalized gaming a priority.”

Over the past few years, out-of-
town businesses have invested heavi-
ly in riverfront property, mostly on
the assumption that legalized gam-
bling is around the comer.

Last year, a large portion of land-

erty was sold to a subsidiary of
Harrah’s casinos and Forest City
Enterprises of Cleveland. The com-
panies paid $23.5 million for the
mall when Gov. Robert Casey was
still in office and it seemed apparent
that ﬂoating casinos would be a reali-
ty. .

McAnney says Gov. Tom Ridge is
for gambling legalization, although
the new governor has been “waver-
ing on the issue.”

' “Ridge has to be clear on what he
wants,” he says. “He’s got to have
the guts to come out and support it.”

Faculty members argued about
whether unionization would improve or
destroy the collegiate atmosphere at Pitt
during yesterday’s meeting of the
University Senate.

Professors Philip Wion and Mark
Ginsburg, the president of United
Faculty, argued in favor of faculty

unionization, but Professors Gerald»

Massey and David Brumble disagreed,
saying it would only add more bureau-
cracy to Pitt’s administration.

Brumble said the bureaucracy of a
unionized faculty would have no con-
cern for the students. _

“Have you ever seen anywhere in the
union ﬂyers ways in which we can pro-

vide more money for study abroad
scholarships?” Brumble said. “Have
you ever seen a union ﬂyer that worried
about student recruitment? Have our
union organizers ever written up a posi-
tion paper about overcrowding in
Hillman Library?”

Ginsburg and Wion argue that unilat-
eral decisions on faculty issues by Pitt’s
administrators cause low morale.

Ginsburg said that he believed Pitt’s
reputation as a top institute of higher
education is threatened by the poor
treatment of its faculty.

“The question before us now is the
future development of the university. a
future that I think depends on the cre-
ativity and energy of the faculty,”
Ginsburg said. “I’m very concerned
that the morale of the faculty is at a
level that it could possibly derail Pitt’s

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT)

institution.”

Decisions made by the administration
concerning faculty health care and
salary freezes were two issues that
prompted United Faculty’s new move to
unionize, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg expressed “personal out-
rage” at the “uncollegial process of
decision making” practiced by Pitt
administrators.

“We see this as an arrogant use of
power.” said Ginsburg. “It’s that kind of
arrogant use of power that needs to be
balanced off or prevented by having fac-
ulty who are in a position to sit down
and negotiate about these things rather
than read about them in The Pitt News.“

Terrorist bomb wounds 29 people in Paris

E? World Events

PARIS — Twenty-nine people
were wounded yesterday in
another terror-istic bomb attack
in Paris, forcing France to con-
front a continuing domestic
threat from political convulsions
in its former colony of Algeria.

French authorities said the
attack was the eighth one
attempted or carried out in the
last three months by Islamic mil-
itants who are protesting
France’s relations with the mili-
tary government in Algeria.

The latest attack sent alarm
through France, signaling that
Algerians are determined to
bring their civil war to their for-

JERUSALEM — The Israeli
government denounced Syria
and Iran yesterday fof support-
ing the Party of God guerillas in
southern Lebanon, who have
killed nine soldiers in the last
week, but it appeared that they
didn’t launch a major retaliatory
attack. _

The lsraeli army needed to
maintain the buffer zone inside
Lebanon that it established 10
years ago against Palestinian
attacks.

The statement reﬂected the
belief that Iran is the main
backer of the Party of God, a

militant Shi’ite movement in
Lebanon, and the Israeli convic-
tion that Syria could rein in the
guerillas if it wanted. The New

ANKARA — Turkey’s presi-

Ciller was asked to stay on

nership with the Republican
People’s Party on Monday. The
center-left party had belonged to
Ciller’s original governing coali-
tion but exited last month over
her economic austerity plan.

Ciller formed a minority gov-
ernment after the coalition col-
lapsed, but it failed on Sunday to
win a vote of confidence. The

has been used in the treatment of breast cancer and has
been shown, particularly in post-menopausal breast can-
cer, to decrease the chance of recurrence.

“At this point, there was a ‘study back in 1982 that
studied women with early stages of breast cancer,” said
Mary Pat Matisko, program coordinator of the BCPT.
“The women in the study that were on tamoxifen
showed a 50 percent decrease of the recurrence of breast
cancer in the other breast.”

“This study is studying healthy women at increased
risk of breast cancer,” said Matisko. “We want to see if
we have the ability to prevent breast cancer altogether.”

The most recent data reported describes the quality of
life of the women at the time they entered the study.
This data will serve as a baseline for how the women
were affected by their participation in the study.

The health and well-being of the study’s participants
were rated by BCPT researchers based on their perfor-
mance in self-care activities, mobility and work in doing
such things as household tasks, disease and treatment-
related symptoms such as breast sensitivity or pain, hot
ﬂashes and psychological and emotional well-being.

“We have taken great care in designing a survey
instrument to comprehensively measure health-related
quality of life data so that we can determine whether
long—term use of tamoxifen by healthy women positive-
ly or adversely affects their overall well-being,” stated
Dr. Patricia Ganz, chair of the BCPT Quality of Life
Committee.

Matisko said the women recruited to the BCPT are 35
years of age or older. She said they are healthy but are at
increased risk of developing breast cancer.

Women have an increased risk if they have a first
degree relative with breast cancer, if they have had any
children after the age of 30, or if they have a history of
benign cysts in their breasts.

“Right now, we’re not sure how long the study will
last,” Matisko said. “We’re just working on reaching our
goal of getting 16,000 women to participate in the study.
We have approximately 11,500 so far. But we want to
reach our goal in a timely way.”

“The women are either on tamoxifen or a placebo;
they don’t know what they’re getting,” she said.

This study comes months after the controversial
breast cancer program run by the embattled Dr. Bernard
Fisher, who is currently in a legal ﬁght with the univer-
sity. Fisher was the head of NSABP while at Pitt.

“Members of the United Faculty Massey said a union would create an

divide were not the obstensive defini-

Massey admitted he did not support
faculty unionization, there were prob-
lems with Pitt’s administration. He
said faculty members should make
personal efforts to resolve individual
problems within the university.

Ginsburg said Pitt’s faculty could
best serve themselves and the univer-
sity by joining the drive for unioniza-
tion.

“By uniting and empowering the
faculty and by instituting collective
bargaining, we believe the potential
of this university can in fact be real-

Not everyone in Pennsylvania is for the legalization that
will send riverboats ﬂoating down the Allegheny River. One
local group, No Dice, is ﬁghting to keep riverboat gambling
out of Pittsburgh.

“From all the research we’ve seen, we know that economi-
cally this will be bad,” says Charlotte Sonne, vice president of
No Dice. “It will addict the community in a negative fashion.”

McAnney believes legalized riverboat gambling in
Pittsburgh will be a big boost for a city that’s in danger of los-
ing its professional baseball team, the Pirates.

. “It will be an additional entertainment component to the
city. It will bring jobs and put people in the hotels,” says
McAnney. “It’s an acceptable form of entertainment in the
‘90s.”

"No Dice supporters disagree, saying that riverboat garn-
bling will not save this economically strapped city.

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy has followed the issue
closely, but a spokesperson for his administration said he is
“neither for it or against it.”

“Mayor Murphy supports the concept; he believes it will
add to the amenities already in the city,” the spokesperson
says. “But he recognizes the problems associated with it.”

Opinions
Bring on the bets

Riverboats up and down the Allegheny. High rollers and high
stakes. Money changing hands between winner and loser. Some
will win and some will lose, but the city of Pittsburgh will defi-
nitely be one of the winners.

Legalized gambling has not been a big issue of debate since
Gov. Ridge took office, but it is about to resurface on the front
lines. Pittsburgh has anticipated the legalization for two years, and
several investors have already sunk large amounts of money into
riverfront property.

Pittsburgh used to be a thriving town, but its businesses have
slowly trickled downstream to other places or have been com-
pletely submerged by larger conglomerates. There is little doubt
that legalized gambling will help Pittsburgh’s economy. Jobs will
be created by the hotels which will be built to accommodate
prospective gamblers, as well as by the riverboats themselves.
The service industries of Pittsburgh will also thrive if gambling is
brought to the city, and even the entertainment and cultural worlds
of Pittsburgh might receive a jump start.

Unfortunately, there are drawbacks to legalized gambling. One
complaint is that Pittsburgh is not a “vacation destination.” Along
this line, many believe that the people who will gamble in
Pittsburgh are the people who live here. -

However, if you have ever travelled anywhere else in the coun-
try, you have undoubtedly met Pittsburgh fans in the strangest
places. (No doubt the hermit who lives in the bottom of the Grand
Canyon is a native of Pittsburgh.) Pittsburgh may not top the list
of places to go for spring break, but a lot of people do spend their
vacations here for other reasons. Those are the people who will
make legalized gambling proﬁtable for Pittsburgh. '

When many of the businesses and industries left this city, they "

took a lot of native Pittsburghers with them. And those people
come back to visit bringing friends and family with them. A lot of
other people visit every year for football and hockey seasons,

,_ whether they are die-hard Steeler or Penguin fans or are following

the opposition. Of course, Pittsburgh is not where you might
choose to go if you want to spend a week on the beach, but this
city is a “vacation destination.”

Another argument against riverboat gambling in Pittsburgh is
the one put forth by groups like No Dice. These groups believe
that gambling is some variation of amorality, immorality or what-
ever. If that were the case, why then does the state sponsor gam-
bling every single day? That is exactly what they do daily at 7
p.m. when the little balls pop from their machines to be caught by
a 90-year-old man. Every time you scratch the silver squares off

' one of those pieces of cardboard, the state is sponsoring gam-

bling.

If gambling is considered immoral or amoral, why haven’t these
groups gone after the state for having a lottery? Is it because the
state lottery beneﬁts senior citizens? What makes the lottery any
different from riverboat gambling? '

The fact is, there are problems which can arise from legalized
gambling. But the advantages gambling will bring to this city out-
weigh the disadvantages -by a mile. Soto hell with Las Vegas.
Bring on Wayne Newton, and roll the dice.

:.._:__ pretend to be

ening, suffocating haze creeps
through the house. The opaque,
ghastly haze slowly creeps from
room to room, entangling every-
thing its path, leaving no comer
and no object untouched by its
sinister presence. Stealthily,
cunningly, the omnivorous
phantom engulfs the helpless,
unsuspecting victims who lie in
its ruinous path. Cruelly, the boy
and the girl are gagged and then
robbed of their frolicsome vitali-
ty, victims of the vile Smoke-
Thing.

The boy is me; the girl, my
sister. I am a victim of the
accursed Smoke-Thing. I was
rescued from its torturous grip
only once it had sated its canni-
balistic appetite for death.
Nevertheless, the Smoke-Thing
was efficient enough to leave
me and my sister in a state of
physical and emotional ruin.
Years later, we are still left with-
out the stamina and vitality we
once had as children. The phan-
tom remains inside us,.slowly
degrading us to lifeless, lethar-
gic beings.

The evil Smoke-Thing phan-
tom is better known as second-
hand smoke. Over the years,
second-hand cigarette smoke
generated" by parents has
become the leading cause of res-
piratory disease among children.
In a sad irony, the parents whom
children pretend to be in games
like “house” may sometimes be
some of the most immoral,
insensible and inhumane men-
tors around. Case in point:
When a parent smokes ciga-
rettes on a frequent basis around

the children with whom they
reside, the innocent child is
effectively strangled to death, a
victim of the parent’s negligence
and ignorance.

There’s a piece of legislation
ﬂoating around on Capitol Hill
urging a ban of nearly all adver-
tising and vending of cigarettes
at all places frequently populat-
ed by teenagers. This legislation
comes off looking rather
obscure after a recent release of
reports which show the real
smoking crisis that needs to be
corrected is among adults. The
biggest single factor inﬂuencing
teenagers to smoke is having a
parent who smokes.
Additionally, hundreds of thou-
sands of children are diagnosed
each year as having respiratory
diseases inﬂicted by the second-
hand smoke of their parents’
cigarettes. Yet, nevertheless,
legislators have diverted atten-
tion from adults to the rebellious
teenagers — exactly the age
showing the largest decline in,
and lowest rates of, cigarette
abuse! A report released by the
National Institute on Drug
Abuse in 1993 showed that
teenage smoking was down 79
percent since 1979 and that even
while tobacco companies spent

, $40 billion in advertising since

1985, smoking by teenagers was
down 37 percent.

Though ardent to protect
ADULTS from smoke in all
public places, officials have not
even bothered to publicize the
much greater hazards posed to
children by PARENTS’ second-
hand smoke! In all likelihood, if
you have asthma, you lived with
at least one parent who smoked.
A 1992 EPA report blamed par-
ents who smoke for causing or
aggravating at least 350,000 res-
piratory diseases EACH YEAR.
Dozens of studies document
lung disorders, delayed develop-
ment and even cancer among
children whose parents
adamantly refused to quit smok-
ing, even‘ when informed about
the detrimental effects smoking

What is even more shocking is
that in a recent press conference,
President Bill Clinton defended
smoking as “a reasonable deci-
sion!”

It is hypocritical to condemn
youths for smoking if both the
politicians and parents, who are
supposed to set examples for
these children, smoke as well. In
a study released in 1989 by the
Health and Human Services
Department, “75 percent of all
teenage smokers come from
homes where parents smoke.”
The report also states that
teenagers who live with parents
who smoke are three times more
likely to be smoking weekly by
age 15, as well as being much
more resistant to anti—tobacco
education.

On Capitol Hill, the portrayal
of teenage smoking has become

. a cliché. Officials select a few

outdated figures to prove that
teenagers are reeling even fur-
ther out of control, even, though
further research repeatedly dis-
proves their point. Yes, smoking
is an immoral act worthy of
being banned on all levels. But,
hey, smoking prohibition would
probably hurt our economy
more than help us. What has
been ignored by our legislators
is that the biggest-threat to the
welfare of our children is the
fact that regardless of what par-
ents do, they act as mentors and
guiding lights. It is parents who
need to be corrected. It is par-
ents who are keeping RJR
Nabisco and Philip Morris thriv-
ing. It is parents serving in gov-
ernment who pretend to be igno-
rant to the facts that THEY are
inﬂuencing teenagers to smoke
and that THEY cause innocent
children like myself to die or be
deformed. If politicians continue
to pretend to be ignorant to this
fact, their regulations will never
work.

My Religion," college radio
was the staple of cutting-edge
music. For years, everyone
from A&R reps to radio heads
to bored people have come to
the College Music Journal
conference to discover the
next Sebadoh or Superchunk.
Bands come‘ here to be dis-
covered, tgain exposure and
m‘ake awhole lotta noise. I

‘and the 411 posse from

WPTS drove to New York City
on the second weekend of
September for four-days of

“constant sounds andsites of

the city that smells like. urine
(you get use to it eventually).
It was my first year at the

~ music-in-the-know equivalent

of Sundance Film Festival.
From friends’ stories, I was
expecting music all ‘day and
night. I was served.

This year’s CMJ featured
Annie Lennox, Matthew
Sweet and Australia’s Nirvana
exports e Silverchair, guest
panelist David Bowie and for-
mer Slayer drummer,’ Dave
Lombordo. Although they are
not part of college music,
scene, they bring the people
in. For every Silverchair, there
were ten Plexis. For every
Matthew Sweet, there were

/ten Mad Scenes. it’s not the

politics or the indie posturing
that makes CMJ worthwhile,
it’s being able tosee the
Deluxx Folk Implosion, fol-
lowed by lvy, then the Boo
Radleys. Throw in a few

. drinks and a stoned taxicab

driver telling stories about
MTV's Music Video Awards,
and you have an extra page in
your journal. CMJ also fea-

 

 sng “oing

ugthe fils d,aIrt :

and Half-Cooked.

They gave us and a thou-
sand others authentic CMJ
badges on a florescent orange
string: we all stood out like
wounded gazelles on the
Segeranti. But we were armed
and ready.

The first night took us to the
Merge Records Showcase at
the new Knitting Factory, the
legendary venue for avant—
garde jazz. By the time of our
late arrivals, Spent had
already started. They played

_fuzzy guitars to a lazy audi-

ence. We wandered around
exploring the alien places,
where we found a computer
which had the Netscape pro-
gram. Craig kindly opened a
site to our homepage, WPTS
(http://www.pitt.edu/~wpts) —
free advertising.

Soon to follow were |ocal’s
The Karl Hendricks Trio, but

, "downstairs Portastatic was to

play, which would have
unevenly divided the audi-
ence. Mac Portastatic was
delayed, however, and a
strong crowd looked up at the
Trio’s performance.

The Magnetic Fields
pushed the. audience towards
the stage. Stephin Merritt and
friends stood on the stage as
they played with lullabied voic-
es, soft and sweet. Noise from
the crowd interrupted their set,‘
and in. between songs, Merritt

retaliated by tossing an empty

water-bottle at. two gabby
folks. Their imperfections lead
to The Magnetic Fields’ per-
fection. “All the Umbrellas In
London” was their perfect
pitch of the night.

 
  

Portastatic played in the
Lincoln Center auditorium. We
only saw a brief moment
where Mac covered Mary Lou
Lord’s » “Jingle Jangle
Morning.” After this set, a
testosteroned voice told the
crowd to “give it up for
Portastatic!” l was quite sure

Arsenio Hall was “in the

house?

On Thursday, MTV was
having their Video Music
Awards, so New York was

. being assaulted by the media.

Time Square was also impos-
sible to drive through, so we
arrived late at SubPop’s
LameFest under the assump-
tion that Plexi was “the band
to see.” The three-piece was
louder then ablitzkrieg. The
band completely epitomizes
SubPop’s Seattle-grunge
sound. It was too scary for
me, so we headed over to the
Mercury Lounge to catch the
Teenbeat/4AD Showcase.

A Our first taxi dropped us off in

the middle of nowhere, and
the second taxi deposited us
next to a diner where the
romantic orgasm scene from
“When Harry Met Sally” took
place. y

We stood in line, but we got
a big denial because wewere
part of the CMJ herd. “No
more badges until Versus are
done.” The bouncer explained
the room was sold-out. A
friend who didn’t have a CMJ
badge was welcomed in with
warm arms as shepaid for her
admission.

I saw Versus almost three '

year ago for the first time at
the Simple-Machine's Working

 

Tfollowing afterno,

  

second time was in
Harrisburg, Pa. when they
toured with Kicking Giant, and
we all shared a 2 a.m. break-
fast at Denny’s. Versus was
halfway through its set as we
forced our way into the back
room. The three-piece added
another guitarist to its mellow
-harmonies. Fontaine’s vocals
were serene —— like hearing

snowflakes would feel.
Next was 4AD’s Liquorice.
Jenny Toomey of

Tsunami/Grenadine and Dan
Littleton of Ida are the prized
members of the band. Their
album, Listening Cap, .didn’t
have the jangle-punk of
Tsunami that I love, but
iToomey’s Harmony Rocket
guitar never sounded more
precious than when she
played in Liquorice. When the
band. covered Franklin
Bruno’s “Keeping the
Weekends Free,” it sent peo-
ple to book stores looking for
Harlequin novels. Even
though the song was interrupt-
ed by a sudden electric distor-
tion, Dan recovered and said,
“There’s,no comeback for
that.” So they continued on
with laughters from the crowd.

From the resurrection of
Unrest was a half-spirited Air
Miami. in Unrest, Bridget
played bass; now she has
moved over to guitarist. 4AD
was handing out free Air
Miami 7-inches, and Mark

showed everyone" their new.

them into the crowd. l was
expecting the sounds of
Unrest to come back, but they
are a dead band. Air Miami is

jangly and poppy with their
guitars and didn’t have catchy
hooks.

Saturday night was another
night that I wanted to see a
handful bands, but they were
scattered all over Manhattan.

-The Fort Apache Showcase
was featuring-Cold Water Flat,
Belly and Fuzzy, but the
venue was completely on the
other_side of town. Ivy and
The Boo Radleys were play-
ing Mercury Lounge',,which
was much closer and was
located, in a better town to
wanderaround in while drunk.

Again, we were turned down
at the Mercury Lounge: “No
more CMJ badges!” After
some time staring at other
people wanting to get in, we
pushed ourselves into the
crowd. lvy’s Domniqu_e
Durand’s voice qualified as
better than being punctured
by Cupid’s arrow or being
sprinkled by Puck's dust; I
was swooned.

in between bands, we wan-
dered over to The Pink Pony
bar. Their jukebox was com-
parable to WPTS music rota-
tion. As I fed quarters to the
7-inch monster, we ordered a
round of drinks to end our
last-night in New York cele-
bration. We celebrated more
than Kool and the Gang and
missed The Boo Radleys.

Our trip wasn't as adventur-
ous as Kids, but we all got a
CMJ story to tell and a band
to talk about.

Jeffrey
directed by Christopher Ashley
With Steven Weber, ‘Patrick
Stewart, Michael T. Weiss,
Bryan Batt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Olympia Dukakis

Hollywood does a few things
well. its specialties are high-
speed car chases, exploding
skyscrapers and turning no-
skill actors into miIlion—dollar
heart throbs. Two things, how-
ever, that it fails at come to
mind just about every time.
Hollywood just can’t seem to
retain the charm of a stage
play once it is adapted for the
screen. Nor can it bring itself to
present believable male homo-
sexual relationships.
Amazingly, Jeffrey does an
usually good job at both.

Jeffrey, played by Steven
Weber (Bryan Hackett of TV’s
“Wings”), has sworn off sex.
Disgusted by the necessary
precautions of condoms, blood

tests and sexual histories that

AIDS has_ required, Jeffrey no
longer finds joy in sex. So he

 

 

decides to redirect his eneries
and chooses the gym as his
outlet. But there he meets the
man of his dreams, Steve: tall,
dark and HIV-positive (Michael
T. Weiss). As hard as he might
try, Jeffrey can’t escape Steve
—— he's in his dreams, in his
fantasies, at dinner parties and
where he works. Jeffrey tries
everything to avoid his lustful
thoughts and desires. He
attends meetings at Sexual
Compulsives Anonymous, self-
motivation seminars with New
Age evangelist Debra
Moorhouse (Sigourney
Weaver) and visits with a priest
who turns out to be interested
in more than his confession.
But the more he tries, the more
we see that it’s not just sex that
troubles Jeffrey. lt’s love, too.
With thoughts of death and
loss haunting him, Jeffrey
allows his fears to stop him
from loving someone who is
HIV-positive. With a little help
from his friends Sterling, a
flamboyant yet sophisticated
interior designer played by

October 19 1995

Patrick Stewart, and Darius,
a Cats chorus boy living with
AIDS, Jeffrey learns that love
is possible in this impossible
age.

Jeffrey and Steve’s love
affair is portrayed with all the

‘romance and tenderness

most often only found in het-
erosexual love stories.
Whether it be flirtatious
glances or passionate kisses,
nothing is hidden from the
camera. Unlike movies such

.as Philadelphia, in which

Hanks and Banderas never
even kiss, or Six Degrees of
Separation, in which the only
view youget is the back of
Will Smith’s head, Jeffrey
shows an intimacy between
two men with no pretenses.
Steve and Jeffrey are in love,
plain and simple. The film
also gives a pretty raucous
fantasy scene where Steve
fantasizes about dancing
with Jeffrey and some other
scantily clad men at a “Hoe-
down for AIDS,’' an event
they are both working at as
cater waiters. I haven’t seen
anything quite like this come
out of Hollywood lately —-

women. ‘

Paul Rudnick wrote the
Obie-award winning, off-
Broadway play and adapted
it for the screen, which would
explain the film version’s rel-
ative success in staying true
to the original work. In his
feature-film directorial debut,
Christopher Ashley worked
with Rudnick to produce this
comedy about living and lov-
ing in a time when AIDS
plagues not only the body,
but also the spirit and the
mind. A comedy about AIDS,
you ask? Rudnick suggests
that nothing else could better
depict the insanity of the
AIDS crisis. '

For those. who have seen
Jeffrey on stage, viewing the
film version may be a bitter-
sweet experience. Ashley
captures most of the charm

of the play well, despite the

less-than-exciting camera
work that gives away his lim-
ited budget. But the intimacy
we share with the characters
when it is played out on the
stage cannot be created up

2.) Switch on the Sega Genesis with

3.) Push away all thebitter feelings
and use your controller to select All-

Unlike this week’s matchup on the ﬁeld,
the Sega game will be close. Let’s take a

Quarterbacks— Dan Marino vs. Vinny
Testaverde

Dan Marino is arguably the best QB
ever to play the game. The Central

at Pitt and led the Panthers to four bowl
bids, including three wins. Marino threw
three touchdown passes, all in the second
half, in the dramatic win over Georgia. -

By Ian Dryburgh
For The Pitt News

The World Series is back in ‘95
after a year off due to the strike last
year. and the two best teams in
baseball will collide. This year the
Fall Classic will featureithe Atlanta
Braves, who’ve made it to the post-
season every year since ‘9l but
haven’t been able to win it all, and

  
   
 
   
 
   
  
  
  
    
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
  

the Cleveland Indians, who haven’t -

been to a World Series since 1954.
Here is how they match up by
position: '
CATCHER: Atlanta’s Javier Lopez
vs. C1eveland’s Sandy Alomar Jr.
These are two young catchers who
are strong defensively and have
decent power. ADVANTAGE:

McGriff vs. Cleveland's platoon of
lefty Paul Sorrento and righty
Herbert Perry. Sorrento hit 25 HRS
and had 79 RBIs, and Perry hit .315
in his rookie year. But McGriff is
an All-Star every year, and his
string of seven straight 30+ HR sea-
sons was snapped this year when he
hit only 27. ADVANTAGE:

‘BRA VES

SECOND BASE: Braves’ Mark
Lemke vs. Indians’
Carlos Baerga.
Lemke fields as
well as anybody,’bu<t
Baerga is a three-
time All-Star and
has power from
both sides of the
plate. His .314 bat-
ting’ average was
ninth in the
American League.

INDIANS

THIRD BASE:
Atlanta’s Chipper
Jones vs.
Cleveland’s Jim

ADVANTAGE:_

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 19, 1995

me the Buffalo Bills

Thome. Thome’s 25 HR’s were the
second most in the AL by a third-
baseman. Rookie-of-the-year candi-
date Jones hit .438 in the post-sea-
son along with solid defense.
ADVANTAGE: BRAVES ‘
SHORTSTOP: Braves’ Jeff
Blauser vs. Indians’ Omar Vizquel.
Blauser is recovering from a
bruised thigh and should be near
100% for the Series. He had a dis-
appointing season (.211, 31 RBI)
but plays solid defense. Vizquel is
probably the best defensive short-
stop in the AL and is not too bad
with the stick either. ADVAN-
TAGE: INDIANS ’
OUTFIELD: Atlanta’s platoon of
Ryan Klesko,Mike Deveraux,
Marquis Grissom and David Justice
vs. Cleveland’s Albert Belle, Kenny
Lofton and Manny Ramirez. Belle.
with 50 HRS; Ramirez, with 30+
HRS and 100+ RBIs; and All-Star
speed—demon Lofton are probably
the best outfield in the game.
Deveraux was the NLCS MVP;
Justice did OK in the playoffs bat-
ting .250 with one RBI: and

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 19, 1995

Halapin brings durability to defensive line

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Mike Halapin’s fingers and wrists are
taped. The black elbow brace on his
right arm helps support his 6—foot-5,
275—pound frame as he bends into his
three-point stance, never taking his eyes
off the ball. His helmet is inches away

’ from the center.

Halapin’s left hand starts to wiggle,
oblivious to the patch of blood on the
back of his hand caused by a fall to the
field’s artificial turf. Only a second later
the ball is snapped. He breaks through
the center’s block, making his way to
the quarterback. Halapin reaches Leon
Murray, the scout team’s quarterback,
just moments after he released the foot-
ball, but the pressure caused him to
throw an interception.

It’s only practice, but Halapin feels it
is the most important part of preparing
for a game. _ "

“It’s the biggest thing we do to pre-
pare physically,” he said. “We also do a
lot of film work to prepare mentally.
Whenever I get a free opportunity, I sit
down and think about what I have to do,
especially right before the game.”

Halapin feels that watching film all
week gives him a good idea of what the
other team will do on game day. It’s
possible to visualize the moves oppos-
ing linemen are going to make. By
doing this, execution becomes second
nature.

“If you’re thinking about a lot of stuff
before the ball is snapped, I think its
just going to hinder you more than it
will help you.” .

By practicing, studying films and
playing in every game the last three-
plus years, Halapin has become Pitt’s
most consistent defensive lineman.

“Without a doubt, he’s been a key
player on defense for us,” said Tom

\ Turchetta, Pitt’s defensive line coach.

“He’s one guy you can always count on,
always trust, and because of- him some
other guys are starting to come around

and play like him.”

After being red-shirt- 
ed his freshman year, _ ‘
Halapin played 11 "
games in 1992 and reg-
istered 36 tackles. The
last three games of the
season, he emerged as
the team’s starting right
defensive end.

In the next two sea- ,_
sons at defensive tack-
le, he had a total of 67
tackles, ll of which
were for losses, and
three _sacks.

In the first seven
games of this season,
he has 23 tackles and a
sack to go along with
eight quarterback pres-
sures.

When asked about
the biggest difference

 

nant under Majors,

if 2  1  Halapin credits the
  ,3.  long—time coach

for getting him
‘ where he is today
 because of his
 focus on disci-
 pline.
f “I’m proud of my
i improvement. I
stuck with it and
got better and bet-
ter even through
 , some tough times
p and rough seasons.
, “You gotta love
the game a lot to
go through that
kind of adversity
and keep coming
out,” he said.
The football field
isn’t the only
place Halapin has

 

between playing in his
freshman year and
playing in his final
year, Halapin joked
“I’m a lot more sore.” ,

In that time, he has gained 40 pounds
and improved his bench press approxi-
mately 90 pounds to 380. He’s also one
of the team’s fastest linemen, running
the 40 in 4.96 seconds.

But one thing that has remained the
same is the team’s record. Halapin is
one of the few remaining players from

~ Pitt’s last winning season, when it went

6-5 in 1991 under Paul Hackett. Since
Johnny Majorstook over in ‘92, the
team has had two straight three—win sea-
sons and looks to be on its way to a
third.

“I was a little skeptical when [Majors]
came,” Halapin said. “He came in and
was an old-time coach; there was a lot
of yelling and screaming. He wanted to
stress that point of discipline right away.
But once everybody started falling in
line, it worked out well.”

realized the
importance of dis-
cipline in his Pitt
career. He will be
I graduating in April
with a degree in information science.

“I’ve improved my football skill; I’ve
learned a lot in school; and I’ve learned
discipline having to keep up with class-
work and football,” Halapin said.

The degree will be something for
Halapin to fall back on if he doesn’t
make it to the NFL. Turchetta feels that
Halapin has a legitimate opportunity to
make it to the next level.

“His overall play, the way he plays
the run, his technique, are great. He’s
always ready to play,” Turchetta said.
“And at the [NFL] level, just like our
level, they’re looking for defensive line-
men, so he’ll get an opportunity.”

Halapin said that, for the most part,
he is a pretty balanced player, but he
plays the run a little better than he pass
rushes.

Along with overall skill and improve-
ment, durability will be something at

which the NFL scouts will be looking.

The brace on Halapin’s elbow is the
result of a hyperextended elbow suf-
fered last year before the Virginia Tech
game. But the injury didn’t cause him to
miss any time.

“It still bothers me; I can’t straighten
it out,” Halapin said. “l’ve got all kinds
of scar tissue and stuff floating around
in there.

“I feel really lucky that I’ve been
pretty durable these five years. I don’t
know why; I don’t know if it’s luck or
what, but I’m real happy.”

That is even more true this season,
when several of the Panthers’ big—play
guys "have gone down with injuries.

Injuries can be used as an excuse for
Pitt’s pitiful 1995 season. It was a sea-
son full of promise and talk of making it
to a bowl game for the first time since
1989.

With wins the first two games over
Washington State and Eastern
‘Michigan, Pitt began to silence its crit-
1CS.

There was a disappointing loss to
Texas and a mauling at the hands of
Ohio State. And then came Virginia
Tech.

“We kind of blew it,” Halapin said.
“Our original plan before the confer-
ence games started was to win the Big
East championship. We thought we had
a good chance to win it.

“Against Virginia Tech we were in
the game. BC beat us pretty good; we
just couldn’t get anything done on
offense.”

Many people say the offense is to
blame for Pitt’s five straight losses.
Halapin doesn’t feel that way.

“Sometimes it gets disappointing, but
we’ve had some letdowns on defense as
well, so you can’t get down on them too
hard,” he said. “They’ve been getting
the job done decently, but they still have
some trouble with execution.”

That’s just the opposite of Mike
Halapin. He’s gotten the job done

Depleted Panthers brace themselves for a Hurricane

Even though the team has been stag-

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports‘ Editor

Last season, Pitt nearly shocked the nation when, in a
torrential downpour, it narrowly lost against the top 10
Miami Hurricanes 17-12.

For the game, Billy West rushed 34 times for 160
yards, the only time a runner gained a 100 yards on the
Hurricane defense last season.

Of course, Billy West is gone for the year with a ﬂac-
tured fibula. Back-ups Demetrius Harris and Chris
Patton have not been the perfect picture of health either.‘

When the season began, Pitt’s offense rolled up
yardage like a well-oiled offensive machine, on the air
and the ground. 

“Our performance at the -beginning of the season was
much better than it is now,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said. .

Against the high-powered Washington St. Cougars’
defense, Pitt rolled up 344 total yards, including two late
touchdowns, to win the game.

The barn doors opened up against Eastern Michigan
University. Pitt exploded for 648 yards of total offense.
To be exact, Pitt rushed for 315 yards and passed for 333
yards. Pitt exploded for 66 points, the most it had scored
in years. The offense was ranked among the elite in the
nation and first in the Big East Conference. ‘

Against the Texas Longhorns, the Pitt olfense kept the
mojo clicking, despite the start of a ﬁve-gaine losing
streak in which the team currently finds itself. Once
again, Pitt rushed effectively, gaining 174 yards on the
ground and 380 total yards for the game. The offense
didn’t appear to be a concern.

It was timefor No. 4 Ohio State to roll into town.

After an_ impressive ﬁrst half, Pitt only trailed 20-14 and
looked good. The second half, Pitt got crushed. For the
game, Pitt’s apparently powerful offense accumulated
264 yards total offense.

The last two games have been a misery for the
Panthers offense.

“Since the second half of the Virginia Tech game, we
have not been the football team that we were earlier in
the season,” Majors said.

Against Boston College, Pitt looked pathetic. It tallied
-11 yards on the ground and 94 total for the game. The
Panthers sputtered all day. They accumulated a season-
low 10 ﬁrst downs. Pitt was shutout 17-0, the first time
it was held under two touchdowns all year.

The epitome of ineffectiveness came with last week’s
embarrassing 29-27 loss to Temple. The win was the
first—ever conference victory for the Owls. Much of the
blame should go to the Panther offense.

“I know it was a very poor performance on our part,”
Majors said.

_ Quarterback John Ryan, who has been benched three
times this season, threw for 74 yards in three-plus quar-
ters. For the game, Pitt managed a measly 227 yards
against a Temple defense that ranks nowhere. The
Panthers put two late touchdowns on the board after
backup quarterback Pete Gonzalez jump-started Pitt with
less than seven minutes remaining.

“By putting Pete into the game on Saturday, it gave us
a change of tempo,” Majors said.

Saturday against the Hurricanes, Pitt will oﬁer a new
look at the starting quarterback position. It looks like
Gonzalez will get the nod as starting signal—caller.

“We plan to use Pete Gonzalez or another young quar-
terback the rest of the season,” said Majors.

The offense needs a desperate turnaround. Once again,

because of execution.

Pitt’s execution is a key concern for the coaching staﬂ’.
The receiving core is again under ﬁre as well.

“All year long the receivers have been highly disap-
pointing. I am embarrassed that this is the case,” Majors
said.

Going into Saturday, the speedy wide-outs appear th
least of the Panthers’ concern. .

Pat Bums/Staff Photographer
Pete Gonzalez, who has replaced John Ryan in
four games this season, may start Saturday’s game.

Step all over famous Pitt athletes on your way to class

By CaroleLyrm Gerlock
F or The Pitt News

Many of us use the sidewalks outside the
Cathedral not knowing we might be walk-
ing on someone famous.

Located between the Cathedral of
Learning and Heinz Chapel is a sidewalk
called the Varsity Walk This walk has the
names of outstanding athletes engraved on
it. Every year since 1950, the name of a
graduating varsity athlete has been
engraved in the walk.

Over the years the walk has gone
through many changes, from changing the
names of the original awards to honoring
women. From 1950-1971, the awards
were called the Athletic Committee Award
and the Charles C. Hartwig Award. In
1975, women were added to the walk

The Athletic Committee Award went to
the athlete who possessed an outstanding
ability in a varsity sport. The Charles C.
Hartwig Award, named after the 1934 All-
America tight end, went to the athlete that
best sponsored the varsity sports program.

According to Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes, the names and qualifications of
these awards changed after the 1971 sea-
son. The names are now the Blue-Gold
Award and Panther Award.

To qualify for the Blue-Gold Award an
athlete must be outstanding in citizenship,
an athletic sport, academic scholarship and
leadership. The Panther Award goes to an

outstanding athlete in a varsity sport.

Each year an award goes to just one
male and female graduating senior Jaynes
said.

Last year’s Blue-Gold winners were
Matt Brady (swimming) and Staci Suggs
(women’s track). Football’s Ruben Brown
and women’s basketball’s Carol Morton
were recipients of the Panther Award.

“There are a lot of great athletes, which
makes it hard to pick,” Jaynes said.

With so many outstanding athletes,
some years athletes do tie. Jaynes said it

happened in 1990-1991 with Darelle’

Porter and Brian Shorter. There are also
times when a player is named for both
awards. This happened in 1978-1979 with
football player Jeff Delaney.

It takes a great deal of time and consid- 0

eration to pick the names for the walk.
According to Jaynes, it is not just the big
names that go on the walk It is whoever
possesses the most tearrr spirit and leader-
ship that receives the award, along with
academic abilities.

When looking at the walk, you will ﬁnd
popular names and sports like Michael K.
Ditka (football 1960-1961), Anthony
Dorsett (football 1976-1977) and Sean
Miller (basketball 1991-1992). You will
also ﬁnd names like Lisa Shirk (women’s
gymnastics 1983-1984), Robert Schilken
(football 1985-1986) and John J. Ciofﬁ
(baseball 1962-1963).

There are also names that one would

James Knox & Pat Bums/Staff Photographers

Mike Ditka and Calvin Smith are two former atheletes who will always be

remebered in the Pitt walk of fame.

expect to ﬁnd that are missing. One name
that comes to mind is Daniel Marino.

“Not to take anything away from
Marino, he is an outstanding athlete, but it
was felt that someone else was more
deserving,” J aynes said.

As Jaynes pointed out, it may be shock-
ing not to see a name that you might
expect to find, but it takes a lot on the ath-
lete’s part to ﬁnd his or her name on the

walk.

This walk and the name engraved in the
walk are taken very seriously.

“Of all the athletic awards, this is the
most signiﬁcant, because the name goes on
the walk and the name lives on forever,”
Jaynes said.

Along with the walk, the athlete also
receives a plaque and award at the senior
awards dinner.

Linebackers— Mike Ditka vs.
Michael Barrow

You gotta love Ditka. "The
Hammer” did it all at Pitt -
tight end, punter — and he also
played basketball and baseball.
Ditka was the ﬁrst—round selec-
tion of da’ Bears in 1961 and
was a member of their champi-
onship team in 1963. He is one
of two Pitt players to be induct-
ed into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame.

Barrow was one of the many
A1l—Americans at Miami and
was also names Big East
Defensive Player of the year in
1992. He also finished second in
the voting for the Butkus Award
given annually to the nation’s
best linebacker. ‘

This is also close, but the
Super Bowl shuffle gives Ditka
the edge. 6
Advantage: Pitt
Sec0ndary— Bob Jury vs.
Bennie Blades

Jury is at the top of a very
short list of great Panther players
in the secondary. He holds Pitt’s
all-time interception record with
21. He was named an All-
American in 1977 and played
his way into the Hula and Japan
Bowls for graduating seniors.

Blades starred at Miami dur-
ing the rnid—’80s and was a first
tearner in both his junior and
senior years. ‘He also won the
Jim Thorpe Award given to the
nation’s best defensive back.

' Miami’s all—time leader in picks

with 19; was drafted third over-
all by Detroit in 1988.

No “Jury‘ ’ jokes allowed here.
Advantage: Miami

There it is: the afternoon is set.
So when Jamm_i German is
strolling i-nto the end zone for
his third score of the day and
every Pitt student, past and pre-
sent, is leaving the unfriendly
confines of Pitt Stadium, you
will have a good game to look
forward to.

Sega: Pitt 28-Miarni 27

Saturday: Miami 56- Pitt
10

Good news, only 22 days until
the Melbourne Tigers invade the
Field House for the first game of
the hoops season.
