Reform

Curriculum Proposals To Correct Deficiencies

At a certain large. urban liberal-
arts college, a student can graduate
without ever having taken a litera-
ture. language or philosophy course.

It‘s for this reason that Pitt-— the
college described 'above-- is now
considering proposals for curricu-
lum reform.

A minimum of27 credits is needed
to fulfill the distribution of studies

requirement now. Proposed changes
call for a minimum of 39. The pro-
posals. which call for stricter lan-
guage. writing. and math
requirements among other things.

Actually reforming the curricu-
lum will require even more than
faculty approval. according to Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences Dean lrwin
Schulman.

“The reforms will mean a change
in faculty. as well as student. behav-
ior," Schulman said. ,

curriculum changes, if they are

approved, will begin with the forma-
tion of faculty standing committees,
Schulman said.

The committees will consist ofﬁvc
faculty members, chosen by Schul-
man.. who will be -responsible for
overseeing and initiating in the var-
ious departments the development
of courses which will fill the curricu-
lum requirements. ’

“I see the committees as playing a
creative role in going out and getting
courses, and in rejecting poorly
thought-out ones," Schulman said.

Schulman explained that if the
curriculum changes go through,
departments will have to adjust to
large numbers of new students by
either creating new courses or alter-
ing present ones. If attempts to
adjust to the changes aren’t made,
then the new requirements will
amount to nothing more than a
menu. an assortment of courses,
Schulman said. V

Funding for any new courses that
are approved will come fromthe
dean’s office. “The dean‘s office
should seek significant external sup-
port for this enterprise,” the faculty
report said.

The various academic 'dlepa:l:-
ments contributed to the refor.r;i
proposals because the curriculum
reform committee. a 126-member
committee appointed by Schulman.

solicited advice from them. i‘

“The proposals will come as '10
surprise to the departments,“ Schul-
man said.

department’s suggestions for

Gilliland Named Program Council Advisor

The Pitt Program Cotm-cil’s
recently-hired program coordinator
has some new ideas for the organiza-
tion this year.

Jimmy Gilliland, who replaced_

Henry Morris at the end of the
summer. said he expects his position
to be “studlent-_centered."

“My position is to help students
plan activities rather than to organ-
i7.e them myself," Gilliland said.

He said selection of PPC pro-
grams should be based on what stu-
dents want and not necessarily what
he believes is right.

I view myself as a problem—solver
in PPC, and I‘m willing to make
suggestions,” he said.

PPC should have a balanced pro-
gram in order to reach as many
undergraduates as possible. accord-
ing to Gilliland. Direction for these
activities. he said should come from
the student body and other student
organizations as well as from
members of PFC.

The program coordinator said he
is looking forward to the completion
of student union renovations. Fol-
lowing renovations,PPC will beable
to reach its full potential by expan-
sions. he said.

Gilliland attended Bowling Green
State University, where he received
his master's degree in college student
personnel. He worked as a graduate
assistant" with Bowling Green’s
activity organization, an experience

he said will help him as PPC's new

Greeks: College Brothers And Sisters

By BONNlE E. THOMPSON
Pit? =’\ews S*oii ‘Writer

They call each other “brother”
and “sister." Some study together.
many live together. and all party
together. Though not a family. they
are very close friends. They are the
Greeks. whose members comprise
l0 to l2 percent of Pitt‘s undergrad-
uate student body.

Made up of i5 sororities and 21
fraternities, the Greek system’s pur-
pose is two—fold: social interaction
and community involvement.

“Although these groups are defi-
nitely socially oriented, this does not
rule out community service." said
Assistant Director of Student Acti-
vites Lou McLinden. who serves as
adviser to the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil and the Panhellenic Association.
the governing bodies of the fraterni-
ties and sororities respectively.

Fraternities and sororities pool
their resources in a combined effort
to raise money for one specific char-
ity every year through various fund-
raising activities. including a
walkathon. “canning“ (collecting
money in cans) at football games
and a dance marathon. the Greeks
have raised $40,000 for each of the
past two years. The money that went
to the Western Pennsylvania Heart
Assocation. is now being used for
medical research at Pitt.

Members emphasized friendship
as the major social benefit to be
derived from belonging either to a
fraternity or a sorority

Sororities allow one to develop a
close group of friends that replaces
the ones you had in high school.”
said Laura Betts. a member of
Sigma Sigma Sigma. “These friend-
ships and the loyalty to your sisters
will last forever."

Once a person takes a fraternity or
sorority pledge. he or she forms a
commitment of everlasting perman-
ence with individuals as well as to
the organization itself.

"Brothers become your best
friends." Morrison said. “You can
sit down and talk with any of them
about your problems and they care.”

Morrison said he believes broth-
erhood is the basic meaning of fra-
ternities.

These guys (his fraternity broth-
ers) took me in like they knew me l0
years.“ he said.

Furthermore McLinden said.
“they provide an education not
received in the classroom. Members
learn to compromise with others, to
respect another person, and they
gain a knowledge of their fellow
man.“

Scholastic achievment is also
stressed in fraternities and sorori-
ties.

Lori Larson. president of Delta
Zeta. added that the key element in
Greeks doing well in academics is
competition.

“There is peer pressure for indi-
viduals to achieve their potential."
Mclinden stated.

Some feel membership in the
Greek system is a way ofderiving the
most enjoyment. participation and
fulfillment out of their college
experience.

“We offer the opportunity to
become more involved in other uni-
versity organizations. such as home-
coming and student government."
one sorority member remarked.

Murphy remarked that “this type‘

- of involvement provides valuable

connections after graduation in
terms ofjob possibilities and refer-

Thomas seemed to sum up what
most members of fraternities and
sororities value in their experience
as Greeks.

“You get roots here; a little bit of

permanence at Pitt." Thomas said. . ti”

"l can always say I was a brother.
Traditions aren’t going to be

Curriculum Reform

changes. When the fine arts and
music departments objectc/d to the
reform committees original propos-
als for their departments. the com-
mittee accepted those departments’
counterproposals because they were
more practical. Schulman said.

The curriculum reform committee
was formed in l979. after the CAS
faculty passed a resolution endors-
ing Schulman‘s efforts to begin the
study of the present curriculum and
possible changes.

Schulmanhad begun the process
in response to a “growing sentiment
in the faculty of the college in favor
of a general reform that would lead
to a restoration of liberal education
to a central place in the college‘s
undertakings,” accordingto the cur-
riculum committeeis report to the
facu lt ’

Sehulman then appointed 22 pro-
fessors and four students to form the
CAS committee. He sought a
“broad representation" of the
humanities. social and natural scien-
ces in the membership. According to
Schulman. his decision was based on
two factors: whether the faculty
member was interested in the prob-
lem of curriculum reform. and
whether he or she believed in the
importance of a liberal education.

The entire committee was then

broken into two ‘subcommittees.
One was to deal with the question of
student attitudes and patterns of
selection. and one would
draft the goals of the curriculum
reform. A

The second committee was
further broken down to subcommit-
tees that would work ondeveloping
the skills requirements and the con-
cept ofa liberal education.

“The foreign language require-
ment was the thorniest issue.”Schul—
man said. Previously. Pitt only
required a student to have\two years‘)
of a language in high school. The
new requirement will require three
years of a language study. or a dem-
onstration of proficiericy. or a _vear

w.of college—level study.

Schulman said the committee was ‘
sharply divided on this issue. with
members advocating a range of
requirements from none to 25/5 years
of language study. The committee
settled on a compromise after sur-
veying language requirements in
other colleges. Schulman said. \

The new language requirement. as
well as those of math and writing,
means that CAS will haveto expand
its placement testing program for
incoming freshmen. Schulman said.

lf passed. information about the
new requirements must be distrib-

'”'%.!::-..uted to students and their high
3*:schools. The foreign language

requirement will not be imple-
mented until I983 to allow high
schools to inform their students they
will need anextra year of language

Tens of thousands of workers decended on the nation’s capital last Saturday to demonstrate against rteaganomics.

Thousands March on Capital

By MATT HAWKINS

Pitt News Staff Writer

WASHINGTON-—It was 4 a.m.
and a loud voice came over the CB
radio in a crowded bus.

“Hey, where’s everybody goin‘? 1

been passin‘ buses all night. Where‘d

them buses come from?” the voice
blared.

There was no reply. The people on
the bus from Pittsburgh to Washing-
ton were trying to sleep.

After awhile another voice came
over the radio.

“I wonder how many of them
buses gonna be in Washington? I
seen a couple hundred of ‘em
myself,” the CBer said.

Scattered laughter. Ther buses
were indeed going to Washington
for one of the biggest protest
marches in the nation’s history. It
was a march called by the AFL-CIO
to protest the economic policies of
the Reagan administration. It was
Solidarity Day, September I9, I98I.

Many groups were represented at
the demonstration. There were

groups who support progressive pol-
itical policies, such as the(NAACP),
the National Organization of
Women and the Communist Party,

as well as citizens concerned about
environmental protection, nuclear
disarmament and racism. There
were also Christians active in hum-
naitarian issues, supporters of ERA
and many others.

Social service workers were also
well represented, especially teachers
and government employees.

The heart of the demonstration
was the trade unions. Among them
were steel workers, iron workers,
farm workers, air traffic controllers,
bakers, the actors’ guild, paper
workers, communication workers,
electrical workers and restaurant
and hotel workers. '

News media‘ estimates of the
crowd varied between 250,000 and
400,000, but some individual unions
reported that they had I5,000 alone
in their respective groups. The union
estimate of the crowd, based on the
passenger lists from the buses, was
around 700,000.

By 3 p.m. the demonstrators
covered the hill of the Washington
Monument and were spilling over
into surrounding parks and the Lin-
coln Memorial reﬂecting pool area.
The Communications Workers of
America provided l0,000 box
lunches and 20,000 soft-drinks for
its members.

‘ One reporter was spotted shaking
his head from side to side and say-
ing, “This is the biggest --- crowd- l’ve
ever seen.“ ‘

The first rally took place at the
Washington Monument around I0

a.m. Actors and musicians provided

entertainment; yes, the actors dis-
owned Ronald Reagan.

The skies were bluegthe sun was
shining, and balloons of every color
could be seen all over the park. A

» number of large hot air balloons and

colorful union flags decorated the
park. The protesters shouted “Hey,

hey! Ho, ho! Ronald Reagan‘s got to .

go!" and “Ronald Reagan ain't no
good! Send him back to
Hollywood!“ ‘
Box lunches popped up every-
where with the Solidarity Day emb-
lem of two handsone black and one
white, clasped together. People car-
ried protest signs as they casually

-mingled in the park.

At one point during the rally at
the monument, the demonstrators
joined hands and began singing
“Solidarity Forever,“ a historical
union song.

A great deal of discussion trans-
pired among "the demonstrators.
One carpenter from West‘ Virginia

~Reagan. (David) Stockman, (Sen.
Howard) Baker and the rest of ‘em
don't really know how working peo-
ple live. They’re surrounded by too
much luxury.‘ They couldn‘t even

survive if they had to get by on my

income or live in my home or drive
around in my car." -

“Yeah,"_a painter said. “If the
election was held today, Reagan
would never get elected."

‘A breeze blew across the park,
and the crowd began to sing the
union song, “Which Side Are You
On.“ Then the carpenter continued.

“If you look at your friends and
neighbors, you see most of ‘em are
either on welfare or unemployed, or

\ they’re earning minimum wage,” he

said. ‘‘It’s hard to survive today if
you’re working 40 hours a week on
union wages.”

A boilermaker walked over and
said, “Listen, what they don‘t under-
stand is that we’re not dumb and
we‘re not children. They’re thinking
about balancing the budget and how
things will look on paper; they don‘t

, realize how they’re affecting human

beings.”
The Carpenters eyes lit up.
“Yeh, that’s what I keep sayin’,
these are lives they’re messin’ with.
I‘m 30 years old; I've got two child-

what it is to work. “I know how to do

Soon a group emerged wearing
blue and white. They carried a large

began to chant. “‘PATCOl
PATCO?" Members of PATCO
were selling union caps to raise
money for families of PATCO

workers who‘are feeling a financial
squeeze due to the Reagan adminis-
tration's mass firing of air
controllers.

The-clean-up crew. Plovided by
the AFL-CIO. began to pick up dis-
carded leaflets and cardboard lunch-
boxes. A group supporting the
Equal Rights Amendment carried
signs saying “Era-—~Yes.“

They wore green and white and
chanted “Hey. hey! What do you
say’? Ratify the ERA!"

A member of the group. who was
from Maryland. said she honestly
didn't think anything would be
accomplished by the Solidarity Day
demonstration.

“But.“ she added. “lt’s worth the
fight." She was a teacher‘s aide and
said she could see the effect that the
cutbacks would have on the children
in the school lunch program. She
added that over the summer she was
unsure whether or not she would
have a job.

“The future is in the kids." she
said. “That’s where we should be
putting the money." .

The Communications Workers of
America assembled near the reflect-

ing pool. A spokesman forthe group
said he doubted whether the demon-
stration would “show Reagan any-
thing." He went on to say that it
would “show the nation that work-
ing people have doubts about Rea-
gan‘s (economic) program.

“He praised the accomplishments
of the Poish union Solidarity and
then steps on the necks of American
workers." the spokesman said.

The communications workers‘
union wore outfits ofpurple and yel-
low and proudly a large yellow hot
air balloon with the letters “CWA"
(for Communications Workers of

"America) written across it. It was.

perhaps. the most diverse union in
attendance, with whites. blacks.
Latinos and Orientals. They carried
signs in support of Affirmative
Action and against the budget cuts.

Members of the Pennsylvania
Alliance oflobs and Energy arrived
in car pools. One representative
from Pittsburgh said he came to
Washington as a “personal expres-
sion of opposition to Reagan‘s
policies."

"This is a people's rally." he said.
“lt is an opportunity for the people
to make a statement. They don't feel
that Reagan‘s policies are in their
interest."

Another member of the alliance.

i The march made its way down
Constitution Avenue with chants,

People were looking out of office
windows. the police were mounted
on horses. Journalists took notes
from the sidewalk as cameras
recorded the event from platforms
high above the demonstration.

Sidewalk merchants were selling
anti—Reagan buttons. such as “let
them eat jellybeans" and “Reagan
for Shah." The demonstration was
colorful and orderly. The crowd was
enthusiastic.

When they reached the Capitol
Building. the speeches began. When-

personal meaning, demonstrators
would wave their signs and cheer.

By 5 p.m. the Pittsburgh groups

hometowns.

The bus ride back was a quiet one.
Most of the people had taken off

again the CB$_adio could be heard.

WASHINGTON -- Thou-
sands of anti-Reagan demon-
strators marched on Washington
Saturday respondingtoeallsby
American labor to protest Rea-
gan‘s attack on the labor move-
ment and working people.

Hundreds of union and non-
union organizations and coali-
tions endorsed the march and
mobilized their constituencies
for the trek to Washington.

Most groups traveled by bus.
while others moved by rail or car.
avoiding the airlines to show
support forthe striking airtraffic
controllers.

Saturday's march began at
noon at the Washington Monu-
ment and proceeded down Con-
stitution Avenue to a rally at the
White House.

Unions were well represented
and comprised a majority ofthe
demonstrators. A

The rally got under way with
speechs by Sam Church of the
United Mine Workers and Lane
Kirkland. AFL—ClO president.
The union stressed their con-
cerns with the Reagan adminis-
tration‘s attacks on social
spending programs ofthe federal
goverment.

Kirkland criticized

Solidarity Details

Reagan for operating without a
mandate.

Also speaking was Coretta
King, widow of Martin Luther
King Jr. She expressed her oppo-
sition to Reagan's attack on the
civil rights laws. Eleanor Smeal
of the National Organization of
Women, another speaker. criti-
cized Reagan for his stands on
abortion and the Equal Rights
Amendment.

A predominant feeling among
the marchers was a concern
about the lack of national unity
among working people in the
face of Reagan’s attacks on
social programs.

Yet. on the local level. the var-
ious labor and community
groups appeared well organized,
especially those from the Pitts-
burgh area.

Despite the success ofSolidar—
ity Day, there is, as yet, no
follow-up plan on the part of
labor.

The demonstrations organiz-
ers and participants. however,
said they are pleased that labor
has made it known that its civil
rights that are becoming increas-
ingly threatened.

Their enemy has been defined.
and the battle, it seems. hasjust
begun.

A Much Needed
Reform

Liberal educ'ation...ean today be seen as an endless effort
to establish coherence in an extraordinarly complex and
ever-changing world. ‘

—excerpr from The -Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Undergraduate Education

The College of Arts and Sciences‘ Committee on Curricu-
lum Reform has taken an extensive look at Pitt's curriculum.
and more importantly. at its effectiveness in providing a
liberal arts education.

The_p_resent curriculum came up woefully short.

That’s why the committee has presented a series of pro-
posals that it believes restore the framework. ifnot the actual
spirit. ofa liberal arts education.

The proposals establish requirements in eachof the aca-
demic areas that are deemed essential to liberal arts educa-
tion. At present. a student can graduate without taking
courses in these areas.

“lt’s astonishing." CAS Dean lrwin Schulman said.“‘that
a student can graduatefrom this university without ever
having taken a literature course.”

The committee. made up of students and faculty. spent
nearly two years surveying graduates. studying other col-
leges‘ curriculums, and conferring with academic
departments.

What has resulted are tougher requirements for writing.
the establishment of new foreign language and math require-
ments. as well as ones for other disciplines which have been
overlooked in the past.

The new requirements certainly constitute an improve-
mcnt..over the old ones. The only challenge of the present
distribution of studies requirements ishow to take nine
courses in nine departments and still avoid going through a
math or chemistry course. It can be done.

Although some students may criticise them as being
overly restrictive. the proposed requirements are unexcep-
tional when compared with other colleges‘ curriculums. as
Schulman pointed out.

The question in evaluating the proposed changes is
whether or not they will truly achieve their intended
purpose.

The structure has been laid down by the committee. but
the actual implementation ofthe reforms will come only asa
result of faculty willingness to make them work.

Because the committee conferred with the various depart-
ments before proposing the changes. they should come as
little surprise to most faculty.

At the FAS meeting Oct. If). the faculty will vote on
approval of the proposed reforms. They also will have the
opportunity to propose amendments to the reforms if they
find certain parts impractical or disagreeable.

We urge the faculty to consider and approve these propos-
als. and upon the approval. ‘to work toward dexeloping
courses and devising ways to deal with the influx ofstudents
into their departments. A

At the very least. these reforms will substantiate the claim
that Pitt makes of being a "liberal arts“ college.

Dear Editor:

As a member of the University of
Pittsburgh academic community, I
would like to take issue with you on
the evident bias of your paper in
favor of abortion. An impartial
reader of the articles related to abor-
tion in last year’s issues of your
paper would have to give you a low
rating for fair and objective report-
ing. Even the paid ads for abortion
seemed to have been given preferen-
tial placement.

In a front page article by Mar-
garet Attwood in your Sept. ll. l98l
issue. not only was the reporting
limited to one side of the issue. but it
was grossly inaccurate. l was a pro-
fessional nurse many years before
abortion was legalized and know
that the statement that “ ‘before
abortions were legal. 50 percent of

gynecology wards were filled with
women who had bungled abor-
tions'" is so far from the truth as to
be ridiculous. The patients suffering
from pelvic inﬂammatory disease
who l took care of before the advent
of antibiotics were there because of
the aftereffects of venereal disease.
In 20 years as a director of nursing
service in two large hospitals. I can
remember only the death due to
an illegal abortion. Today. public
health authorities are again becom-
ing very concerned about the vene-
real disease problem in this nation, a
fact about which your paper has lit-
tle to say.

The lead in the Sept. ll article
which states that “area physicians...
are joining forces to fight the pro-
posed state abortion bill"is also mis-
leading. Many. many physicians

believe that abortion takes the life of
an innocent human being. and there-
fore they are vehemently opposed to
it.

Your paper——— as earlier ones in
our history which dealt with the
rights of slave owners. but forgot
about the rights of slaves- - is ignor-
ing the rights of unborn offspring of
mothers who have abortions. Abor-
tions may always have been with
us—- so has unjust killing of the
born——but there is no comparison
between the number of lives snuffed
out in the past and the holocaust of
today.

Let’s have some responsible jour-

nalism in The Pitt News.

Dear Editor:

A recent report on the front page
of The Wall Street Journal stated
that “the University of Pittsburgh
regularly trims $3‘ million a year
from existing operations...to finance
new programs that are in high
demand.” It would be more accurate
to say that $3.million from under-
graduate tuition fees are channeled
into the School of Medicine ata time
when clinical faculty members are
quietly squirreling away millions of
dollars. generated from services ren~
dered to patients. with little or no
regard for the general welfare and
plight of students at Pitt.

Until four years ago the School of
Medicine derived its revenues large-
ly from tuition. stateappropriations
and overhead on federal grants. ln
l97o a potential new source of dol-
lars was realized when the teaching
faculty of the Health Center formed
private corporations. Thirteen
separate corporations or “practice
plans." as they are called. were
created. and considerable profits
from patient care in places like
Presbyterian-llniversity Hospital.
(‘hildrcn‘s lospital and Western
Psychiatric Institute were diverted
from hospital profits into highly
secret and carefully guarded “kit-
ties.” Last year alone over ‘$18 mil-
lion flowed into these practice plans.

really knows. because the disposi-
tion of these funds is known only by

however. is the fact that millions of"

The Long

Range Effects

Of Short Term Cutting .

By MARK COLLINS

Pitt N»-ws Stuff Writer

The theory behind fiscal conser-
vatism is sound enough cut what
isn't needed. This includes all nones-
sentials. like substituting margarine
for butter or generic macaroni for
that “cheesier" kind that kids love.

There are always harder choices
to make. When the money gets very
tight. cuts must be made into some
respected programs. Apparently to
the state government. Pitt and the
rest of the state-related universities
fall into this unfortunate category.
According to Government Rela-
tions Committee member Jamie (ill-
key. Pitt is expected to get a 5-6
percent increase if funds this year.

A college degree. it seems. is
becoming a rich man's goal. It was

once considered an integral part of i

the American Dream. along with 2.4
kids in a checkerboard suburb with a
driveway groaning from the weight
ofjbicycles and station wagons. The
money was freerthen. and the goal
was easier to achieve. All it took was
hard work and perseverance.

Hard work no longer pays off in
school. unless it‘s work at a paying
job to retire some of the debts of
education. We have become a stu-
dent population founded not in the-
ory and homework. but in part—time
jobs and federal grants. "Working
for your education“ is a phrase to be
taken literally.

As many at this university can
attest. school is difficult enough
without the added burden of
employment. What is especially‘

wisely used by the school‘s clean to
avert the astronomical tuition
increases that now burden our stu-
dents and make us a national
disgrace. ,

The question is not whether the
department of pathology. for exam-
ple. was wise or not inispending
Sl60.000 of their practice plan
money on a single piece of equip-
ment. The chairperson of that
department may believe. and with
some justification. that practice-
plan-generated dollars turned over
to the dean of the School of Medi-

cine would simply be poured down‘

the proverbial rat hole. The l2 heads
of the other practice plans may,feel
the same way. thereby depriving the
dean of substantial revenues.

It is conceivable that the 13
uncoordinated practice-plan chiefs.
all riding off greedily in their own
self-justified directions. have gener-
ated a resultant vector that takes the
School of Medicine down a wasteful
and undesirable path. The outstand-
ing question is: How long will the
entire faculty of the state-related
University of Pittsburgh sit idly by
while an arrogant and unaccounta-
ble clinical faculty exploit millions
ofdollars in practice-plan revenues.
with complete disregard for the
overall well-being of the School of
Medicine and the university‘?

Students in the School of Medi-
cine. who last year saw freshman tui-
tion increase by 32 percent (50
percent for non—residents). should
be asking where the $18 million in
practice-plan revenues went. They
should ask why some of these mil-
lions ofdollars spent on travel. thick

carpets and wood paneling. sophisti-
cated equipment and retirement
plans were not conserved to mini-
mi7e the magnitude of the tuition
increase. Also. state legislators. who
have been Chancellor Posvar‘s per-
ennial scapegoats for the serious
problems resulting from misman-
agement of resources and poor lead-
ership in the Health Center and
university. should withhold any
increase in state support to Pitt until
the chancellor‘s secret practice plans
have been subjected to careful scru-
tiny by auditors from outside the
university.

Senior Vice Chancellor Freeman
was quoted in The. Pin News as
being concerned that we are “one of
the costliest public institutions in the
country and we don't think we can
continue to push up tuition at l0 to
I2 percent.“ ln his interview with
The Pitt News. Dr. Freeman care-

fully refrained from mentioning the
practice plans ofthe School ofMed-
ricine. Instead. he set up the state
legislators and Gov. Thornburgh to
take the blame in the spring of l982.
when medical school tuition will
likel_v skyrocket. lf Dr. Freeman is
sincere in his concerns about tuition.
he must move for full disclosure of
the practice plans of the School of
Medicine. ‘

ironic is that most of the students
here are working toward the goal of
employment —the full-time kind,
the career and station-wagon type.
Unless federal grants become easier.
or the state government forks over
more money. college will be an
animal owned solely by the rich.
Even in an era ofcost-cutting and
cutbacks in welfare and unemploy-
ment payments. it seems absurd to
commandeer money from universi-
ties. The men and women who will
one day populate administrative lev-

els ofgovernment seeking answers
to the same questions faced now

.arc going to be college graduates.

not technical school alumni. Provid-
ing more money for the education of
engineers. nurses. and profession-
als will not guarantee that today’s
problems will be solved. But limiting
funds for higher education insures
lower enrollment. which in turn
assures nurses. engineers and profes-
sionals ,.will be around to help: 3lVC
the problems of the future. In fiscal
terms. that principle seems unsound.

' Our job is to re-create a corner of

the world accurately enough to fool
an expert. In today’s diverse world
of technology, it’s a job in which
creative intuition and technical
skills must go hand in hand.

For example, we’ve developed

completely functional control
rooms that simulate the operation
of 30 different electric generating

plants——some run on oil, some on

coal, and some on nuclear energy.
And we’ve built scores of simulated
cockpits, engine rooms, command ‘

posts, etc., with which we’ve
brought sweat to the brows of
eady-handed old pros.
it all adds up to an impressive
record in what you might call “high

chicanery.” it also adds up to the

most diversified kind of technologi-
cal environment you can experi-

ence in the industrial world.

Mechanical and chemical engi-
neers work hand-in-hand with
computer scientists and electronic .
designers, with thermodynamicists
and visual display experts, with
theoretical scientists and

seasoned system operators...all
with one object: To produce the
most realistic simulation possible.

No other branch of technology
offers more opportunity for growth .
and diversity than Link Simulation
Systems. As the pioneer in simula-

According to Ralph Morrison. Morrison says. national students at the university orientaion usually get good

Pitt is a very international univer-
sity, complete with 238 visiting
faculty, worId—renowned National-
ity Rooms and a Semester at Sea
Program.

However, the most important ele-
ment rounding out this worldly
realm‘is the L500 international stu-
dents who attend Pitt. These stu-
dents, interacting with faculty, other
students and the community, build a
base that helps the university com-
munity to understand the world and
its roblems.

     

     
    
  
 

and having a Pakistani seated on
your left. a Hawaiian on your right
and an African across from you.
Sound unusual‘? This is normal
occurrence for students residing in
Intercultural House. located at 272
N. Dithridge St.

Life at Intercultural House offers

the U.S. and the world a chance to
explore the attitudes, values and
lifestyles of men and women having
dissimilar racial, cultural and aca-
demic backgrounds.

Approximately 25 percent of the
students at Intercultural
come from foreign countries; the
other 75 percent are natives ofstates
as diverse as Ohio and Hawaii.

Why such diversity?

“It gives students from other
countries the chance to live with
Americans and learn about the dif-
fering segments of American cul-
ture.” says Aftab Kazi. a student
from Pakistan working toward a
Ph.D. in international politics. “It
also eases the cultural shock that
many students experience when first
arriving in Pittsburgh."

Intercultural House was first
opened in I969 by the Gertrude
Stein Foundation under the direc-
tion of Dr. John Tyler. The basic
premise of the house. Tyler said. was
to provide “an understanding into
the nature of racial prejudice in the
American culture and a means of
dealing with it on both a collective
and personal basis."

According to Tyler. a Christian
Science practitioner and a former
Pitt political science professor.
Intercultural House was considered
extremely innovative for I9o9——~a
period of enormous interracial
hatred and misunderstanding. With
the advice and support of black lead:
ers and with commitments from
Pitt? however. the house weathered
those first few stormy years.

Pitt's commitments for the first
five years included free tuition to
students residing in the house. col-
Iege credit for house programs and a
food service. During one of these
years. over 500 applicants vied for
the 22 resident spots. But. this all
changed in I974 when Pitt chose not
to renew its commitments to the
house. —

     

22 students from various regions of

House -

director of the Office of Interna-
tional Services (OIS). international
students will contribute over $lO
million to Pitt‘s budget in tuition
and over $8 million to the Oakland
area in expenditures for food, rent
and clothing over the next I2
months.

“For the fall of I982. we estimate
that the total expense based on three
terms will be $l4,700 for an interna-
tional graduate student and $14,400
for an undergraduate student.”

    

lt’s Not Just Any House

Imagine sitting down to dinner‘

The Inercultural House is home to those internationar
students interested in learning about’America’s racial

relations.

“By I974. the immense pressure
disappeared for facilitating black
and white relationships. and it was
no longer a high priority with the
university." Tyler explains. “The
university still maintainsinterest in
the house through its community
service office."

Matt Hawkins. a junior in Pitt‘s
School of Social Work echoes the
primary reasons for establishing the
house when explaining why he chose
to live there.

“I wanted the cross-cultural expe- V

rience." Hawkins says. “I think this
house is productive in terms offaciIi-
tating black and white relations and
in giving a broader understanding in
racial and international lifestyles."

Residents also help each other
adjust to their new surroundings.

“I‘ve never seen snow.“ says Jac-
quie Pomeroy. a Hawaiian student
studying for her Ph.D. in‘econom-
ics. “I don‘t know what to expect or
what clothes I'll need. but fortu-
nately my room mate is from Pen-
nsylvania.“

Friendship and advice aren't the
only advantages ofliving in Intercul-
tural House. The house itself is spa-
cious. which gives residents access to
a living room. dining room and
even a game room.

     

Results of an OIS study reveal
that 60 percent of Pitt's interna-
tional students have their education
financed by their governments or by
outside organizations, thus reducing
the personal financial burden for
more than half of the students.

A breakdown of Pitt’s interna-
tional student population shows
that Nigeria is the most represented
nation, with I50 students, followed
closely by Taiwan, India, Venezuela
and Egypt. Close to I00 ofthe inter-

What sets Intercultural House -
apart from other boarding houses is
its innovative programs. In the past
these programs have included infor-
mal lectures by noted Pitt professors
with expertise in international
affairs and racism as well as cultural
programs with Hillel House.

Pakistani student Kazi. also the
present director of Intercultural
House. has been working with Pitt
administrators in the hopes ofestab—
lishing more joint programming
with the university. '

Tyler says that he would be
"happy to see more formal univer
sity participation come about.“

“The potential is there to maxi-
mile the benefits ofthis program on
a formal basis.” according to Tyler
“The integration of black and whit
understanding is going to be thi.‘
nation‘s greatest problem during th
next several years.“

Intercultural House is maintained
primarily by funds derived from the
(iertrude Stein Foundation and the
$775 fee charged to each resident.
This fee includes lodging in a large
double room. catered dinners five
nights a week and programs held at
the house. It alsorprovides an invalu-
able exploring both racial and inter-
national culture. /

come from Sweden. France. Eng-
land and Denmark.

The most recent rise of interna-
tional students from one nation is
China, where in the last two years
their enrollment at Pitt has multip-
lied from zero students to 55.

“The majority of international
students here choose engineering,
education, library and information
science and graduate study in health
or international politics as their
majors,” says Morrison.

He adds further that the enroll-
ment of international students has
doubled at Pitt since I976, and he
cites Pitt’s graduate programs for
the increase.

However, this increase can also be
attributed to the OIS and Morrison.
OIS is a centralized office that deals
with the non-academic problems of
international students and visiting
faculty. The office is also responsible
for recruiting international students
and keeping in touch with them after
they graduate and return home.

“The OIS has given us money and ‘
helped to make our lecture program
a success," says Jerry Miller, presi-
dent of Pitt International Student
Organziation (PISO). “It is also par-
tially responsible for Pitt’s reputa-
tion around the country as a
university that offers excellent edu-
cational opportunities, both formal
and informal, to international
students.”

All signs indicate that U.S. college
enrollment will decline in the I980s
because of the nation's shrinking
high school graduate size. As for
international student enrollment at
Pitt, Morrison believes it will stay
about the same as it is now.

“The I500 international students
is a size that our present staff can
adequately handle," he says. “Also,
with the costs rising at almost I0‘
percent annually, it may become
increasingly difficult for countries
with limited wealth to send students
to Pitt."

Housing or the lack of it is
another problem that confronts sev-

xeral of Pitt’s international students.

Over 80 percent ofthe l.50() interna-
tional students are graduate stu-
dents. and Pitt does not provide
housing for them.

“Housing is the foremost com-
plaint we hear in exit interviews.".,

- ..- - ~ .5-
says Morrison. Ihe lack of availa-

ble housing leads to cultural frustra-
tion. which. in the long run. hurts
recruitment.“

One of the top recommendations
made by the Middle States Associa-
tion evaluation team that visited Pitt
last November was that the univer-
sity provide graduate student
housing.

Although no definite plans have
been made by universityadministra-
tors to follow this recommendation.
OIS is doing all it can to provide
quality housing. I

“We provide new students with a
list of apartments and landlords‘
names who will rent to international
students." sa_vs Morrison. “Most
students who arrive on time for

 

housing."

The most successful attempt by
OIStoprovidequalityhousingisthe
International Living Unit.

Proposed" by Morrison in I977 to
promote cross-cultural exchange
among an equal number of under-
graduate male and female. U.S. and
international students, the unit
opened in the fall of I978 on two
floors in Bruce Hall.

Today. the unit occupies the l0th
and Ilth floors of Bruce Hall and
houses 60 students.

“There’s more of a sense of com-
munity here," says Maura Quinn.
the International Living Units resi-
dent assistant. “It’s a whole different
world learning about other
cultures.”

Quinn addsthatinternationalstu—
dents from Mexico. Japan, Iran and
Lebanon live in the unit and that
future plans_for the unit include col-
lege credit for residents and more

“Housing is the
foremost complaint
we hear in exit inter-
views. The lack of
available housing
leads to cultural frus-
tration, which, in the -
long run hurts
recruitment. ”

involvement in international life at
the university.

The Pitt International Student
Organization also brings American
and international students together
socially.

PISO is an I I-year-old social and
educational organization whose
activities are designed to lay aside
students’ home cultures. 7

“The organization is unique in
that it is open to all students." says
Jerry Miller, president of PISO. “It
fosters a high quality of interna-
tional life on the Pitt campus."

PISO activities center around its
goal to promote "international
peace through understanding.”

Last year’s PISO lecture series
included faculty members speaking
on such topics as El Salvador and
the Iran-Iraq war. Each lecture drew
an audience. including faculty
members. of over 80 pC0plc_

The first lecture for the new term
will be a panel discussion on nuclear
power overseas. A specific date has
not yet been set. but Miller says it
will be sometime in early October.

Other PISO activities include a

ﬁns

Kazi says that in his four years
here, he has- not made the close
friends he made at Edinboro.

Morrison offers
for this

OIS Director
some explanation
“unfriendliness.”

“When I give talks to Pitt stu-
dents. I’m often surprised at the
number of students who are not
aware of Pitt’s vast elements, includ-
the international." he says.
“Only 30 to 40 Pitt undergraduates
choose to study abroad each year.
And when the Semester at Sea Pro-
gram sailed last February. only eight
of the 5()0 students aboard were Pitt
students."

An international graduate student
from West Germany cannot get too
involved in PISO because. as she put
it. “studying physics 80 hours a week
doesn‘t leave room for much else."

Egyptian student Mohamed Met-
walli says the hardest adjustment
he‘s had to make in America during
his three years here is the amount of
liberation women have. However.
he is quick to praise American cul-
ture. because “here there‘s an oppor-
tunity to make the future—- some-
thing you can’t find in any other
country.“ ’

And the international students
themselves provide an important
opportunity at Pitt.

“They provide an important cos-
mopolitan feeling that brings’ an
added dimension to education." says
PISO member Jim S‘/ymecki. sum-
ming up the feelings of many at this
international university.

The lines leading to Pittsburgh from Venezuela, Nigeria, Egypt and England
indicate only a few ol the countries represented at Pitt.

THE WORLD
IS YOUR CAMPUS -

Pitt's Semester at Sea Program not only promises “the world is your campus,” but is
provides American students with the chance to be a genuine international student for a

term.

The death of a Carnegie—Mellon

University statistics professor this
‘ummer in Taiwan has surfaced
ears and serious questions about
the possibility of espionage on col-
lege campuses.
Dr. Wen-Chen Chen, a native of
Taiwan, was found dead on July 3
near the library ofthe National Tai-
wan University only hours after
being questioned about his alleged
political activities in the United
States. Although the Taiwan
government’s autopsy concluded
that he fell or leaped from the
library’s fifth-floor fire escape, both
Chen‘s widow. Su-jen Chen. and
CMU President Richard Cyert
charge that he was murdered.

A hearing held by a House sub-
committee on Asian and Pacific
Affairs this summer. while an inves-
tigation into the professors death,
raised a broader issue of whether
foreigners- and international stu-
dents in particular—living in the
U.S. are victims of espionage.

During the hearing. Cyert told the
subcommittee that he had received
“considerable information” naming
students on both the CMU and Pitt
campus as informants for the ruling
Kuomingtang in Taiwan and
charged that Chen “was a victim of

campus surveillance in the US.”
" Presently there is a good possibil-
ity that the U.S. will learn first—hand

the circumstances surrounding
Chen’s death. V

According to yesterday’s Pitts-
burgh Press, Allegheny County
Commissioner Cyril Wecht. who
went to Taiwan on Sunday with
CMU professor Morris DeGrpot,
“may have been successful in his
attempt to perform an autopsy” on
Chen's body.

During the hostage crisis in lran,
many students from that country
who were studying in the U.S. were

deported or chose to leave after

Americans’ attitudes toward them
made life unbearable.

According to Ralph Morrison.
director of Pitt‘s Office of Interna-
tional Services, none of the Iranian
students attending the university
was deported after the overthrow of
the shah of Iran or during the hos-
tage crisis.

“A lot of students chose to go
home to support the revolution and
to be with their families.“ Says Mor-
rison. “Many lranian students that
we have been able to keep in contact

‘Spies:

 

most cases it is impossible(forthem)ﬁ
to get out of the country.”

One legal option open for interna-
tional students who believe that
returning home after a change in
government would prove dangerous
is political asylum.

An international student, whose
government cut off his education
funding recently, says he is consider-
ing this option but is afraid he_.m_ay
be-turned down because of President
Reagan’s friendly political relation-
ship with his country’s government.

“There is also a long—term disad-
vantage with seeking asylum,” he
explains. “it could be termed politi-
cal suicide because when you return
home, even under a new govern-
ment. you are always suspected of
being a CIA agent.“

Other options available to this
international student include marry-
ing an American citizen to change.
his visa status or. seeking asylum in
such countries as France Canada
and Mexico.

 Pitt Delays Takingstance on CFA-N BC Deal

 By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Sports Editor

The University of Pittsburgh has

delayed taking a position on ratiﬁca-
tion ofthe Collegiate Football Asso-

\§ ' ciation's NBC-TV contract until

i after the NCAA‘s December 3-4

convention on restructuring.

according to Jack Freeman. Pitt
senior vice ' chancellor for
administration.

’ Calling the existing NCAA gov-

ernance structure. and not television

or property rights, the primary issue
in the current CFA-NCAA conflict.

» Freeman said yesterday Pitt Chan-

, cellor Wesley Posvar has mailed let-

 ters to both the CFA and NCAA

: stating that “Pitt is reserving its posi-

‘’ tion (on ratification of the NBC-TV

 contract) at this time.“

f Freeman made the announcement
at the Pitt football press conference
at Oakland’s University lnn.

 “The delay allows us, first, to wait

...........».....-.. .....- ........a.. , ~.. _,, .,

until the NCAA’s December con-S

vention. where we may be able to
work out our differences with the
NCAA. Second, it allows time for
some legal questions to be resolved,”
Freeman said.

One such legal question. which is
currently being tested in two state
courts. is who owns the rights to
negotiate a school‘s television con-
tracts. The NCAA Council inter-
prets the NCAA bylaws to that it is
the sole agent for negotiating its
members’ TV contracts for football.
according to Freeman. The CFA, 6]
of the nation’s top football schools,
maintains that each individual
school should control its own prop-
erty rights.

Freeman said he expects the two
class action suits filed Sept. 9 by
three universities on behalf of the
CFA to decide the property rights
issue.

One suit, filed by the University of
Texas, sought and received a tem-
porary restraining order from an
Austin state court prohibiting the

NCAA from threatening or taking
disciplinary action agianst its
schools that participate in the CFA's
television arrangement with NBC.
The other suit. filed jointly by the
universities of Georgia and Oakla-
homa. seeks a judgement on the
property rights issue concerning
football telecasts. it also seeks to
prevent the NCAA from taking
enforcement proceedings against
CFA members that go with the CFA

L tclevison plan.

The suit. which is still pending.
essentially will decide who owns the
right to control big-time collegiate
football.

“Our position and the CFA posi-
tion is that institutions’ property
«rights are vested in the institution.
The question of governance is the
primary issue at hand. The issue is
not TV." Freeman, said. “Many
(CFA) members would go along
with the NCAA contract (with CBS
and ABC) as it’s written ifthe gover-
nance structure could be amended.“

The NCAA has negotiated a $263
million TV contract with ABC and
CBS for its members football games.
which runs in direct conflict with the
CFA’s Sl80 million pact with NBC.

The NCAA’s decision to call the
December convention was seen by
Pitt and many schools as a conces-
sion to the CFA to head offa battle
over TV rights. according to Free-
man. The CFA has long sought a
restructuring of Division I-A. col-
lege football’s top division. in order
to gain greater control over its televi-
sion rights and governance rules for
football. Freeman said the NCAA's
decision to call the convention has
persuaded many CFA schools to wit
until December instead of going
ahead with the NBC contract now.

“A substantially large number of
schools have sent similar letters (to
Pitt’s) to both organizations reserv-
ing their position on the CFA televi-
sion contract,” Freeman said. “The
NBC contract has essentially been
set aside at this time. The CFA lead-

ership has taken the position that we
can bring bout a settlement with the

NCAA."

Specifically, the changes the CFA
would like to see in the NCAA struc-

ture. according to Freeman, are:

0 The elimination of the so-called
“Ivy Rule,“ which qualiﬁes schools
that field at least I2 varsity sports for
l-A. Under the CFA‘s
proposal, the “ivy Rule" would be
replaced with new criteria for_ Divi-
sion l-A membership, such A as a
school's size and its average football

Division

attendance.

The result would decrease the si7c.
of Division l-A from I37 to about90
schools. Such a reduction. the CFA
has said. will give big-time football
greater control ofits own destiny by
weeding out smaller programs cur-
rently beneﬁting financially from
larger programs that spent a lot on
football.

Coach Reaches
Win Milestone

By LISA GRENEVlCKl

P:t‘£~ws Soodswrier

Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
reached a milestone in his career
Wednesday. recording his l50th win
with the Panthers‘ 3-1 victory over
St. Vincent College.

Bemis’ team is 4—() this year. How-
ever. the road hasn‘t alwa_vs been
this smooth for Bemis. the only
coach the Pitt soccer team has ever
had in its 29-year existence.

When Bemis first came to Pitt in
l947 to take the post as intramural
sports director. intramural soccer
was one of the programs he man-
aged. lt was one ofthe more popular
intramural sports then. and interest
in forming a varsity soccer team at
Pitt began to blossom.

The first step was the soccer club
Bemis organized in l952. The club
usually played about six matches a
year against local league teams and
other schools’ junior varsity teams.
By- I954. soccer was declared a Pitt
varsity sport.

In eight years. Bemis and his I962
team made Pitt's first appearance in
the NCAA regional playoffs, return-
ing again in l965. The I962 team
featured All-America Paul Liberati
Pitt soccer‘s first three partial-
scholarship players. ln his career
Bemis has coached six All—Americas
and a lengthy list of All-Conference
including this year's
team scoring leader Eric Tiedtke.

In the mid-l960s. Pitt raised tui-
tion and its academic standards. and
it became harder for all Pitt coaches.
including Bemis to recruit athletes.
Recruitment was especially tough in
sports-— —like soccer with few
scholarships.

By I968. however. things
improved when the university began
to revitalize Pitt‘s athletic programs.
Football came first. followed more
recently by the other men‘s and
women‘s athletic programs. As head
of the Pitt soccer program. Bemis

has survived through it all. although
he admits the road has been rocky.

“The biggest problem l‘ve had
with the Pitt soccer team is that we
have never had a regular practice
field." Bemis said. “Even now. we
don't practice on a full-size field.“
Which makes it tough for a team
that plays all its game on full-size
field. which are slightly larger than a
football field.

Bemis said that in the past his
squads have practiced on a wide
range of surfaces--everything from
the side of a football field~ with
only enough room to conduct shoot-
ing practice to a football field.
depending on when the football
team was practiceing.

Years ago the Pitt bootcrs played
their games at Schenley Park. but
transportation soon became a prob-
lem. and the park’s field was aban-
doned. In the l9o()s. the team used 21

The Panthers even used old

Even today. the Panthers practice
on a smaller-than-regulation grass
field. yet play their games under the
lights at Pitt Stadium. a regulation-
si/c field. Some things never change.

Neither has Bemis‘ affection for
soccer.

Bemis got acquainted with the
game early in life as a junior high
school player. When he went on to
high school and later. to Edinboro

and baseball and wrestled. But he

Pitt Athletic Department's Choice

By FREDERICK BEERS

Pitt ‘News Sportswriter

may watch the Panthers from sec-
tions 3, 2| or 34.

It is possible underthe new plan to
get sideline seats without donating.
These, however, are located from
the I0-yard line to the end zone in
the bottom eight rows of seats ring-
ing the stadium.

Under the new plan, seats are
assigned based on the number of
years one has purchased season
tickets, the number of years one has
contributed to the university and the
total amount of one‘s contributions
on a first-come, first-serve basis. ’

According to Dean Billick, Pitt
associate director of athletics -for
public affairs, three things forced the
university to go to the new plan?
expansion of women's sports pro-
grams, increased tuition costs and -
inﬂation.

For example, the cost of women’s
athletics at Pitt was $40,000 five
years ago. That figure is now up to
$500,000. In addition, the costs of
football equipment, travel expenses‘
and training table for football and
basketball have all nearly doubled in
the last five years.

But the biggest factor prompting
priority seating at Pitt, according to
Billick. is the ever—widening gap

,between tuition increases and the

So you thought for the dollar you
paid to see the Pitt Panther football
tea“m waltz past Cincinnati you
should have seen something better‘?
Some Pitt faithful had to pay $52 to
see the game.

It sounds ridiculous compared to
what students pay, but that’s what
the best seats at Pitt Stadium now
cost, thanks to the new priority seat-
ing plan Pitt introduced this year.

Priority seating is nothing new to
big-time college football—in fact
nearly all major football schools
have already institutednft. Pitt held
out until last spring. '

Pitt’s priority-seating
works like this:

For the best seats in the house, the
covered section at the top of sections
18 and I9, one must donate $250 to
the university booster club, the
Golden Panthers, plus $66 fora Pitt
season ticket.

For the remainder of the seats in
those sections, the cost per seat is
$l50 above the season ticket price.
Sections I and 36 cost $l00 plus the
ticket charge, and for $50, one may
sit in sections 2, 20 or 35. For a $25
donation to the booster club, one

subsidy paid to the athletic depart-
ment by the university to cover
scholarship costs.

Wi\th Pitt's projected athletic
scholaTship .costs running at
$944,272 for the upcoming year and
the subsidy from the univcrsity‘s
general account at only $5l7,000,
the athletic department is left with a
$400,000-plus deficit.

. In the past, the Pitt Golden
Panthers made up the difference.
However. they currently raise
$400,000 a year: funding this year’s
deficit would dry up their coffers. It
would also eliminate the “little
things” they cover, such as recruiting
films and training table.

Such financial problems left the
Pitt athletic department at a cross-
road; it didn‘t know where to get the
additional money.-

Billick explained that alternatives
to priority seating were considered,
but they weren’t considered feasible.

Cutting non-revenue sports, for
example, to make up the money
would have required such a large-
scale cut that it was ruled out,
according to Billick. Increasing
ticket prices was like-wise ruled out
because the university thought it had
gone as far as it could in that area.

A Bucknell Drops Lady Panthers

.»‘a By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Sportswriter

‘The Pitt Lady Panther tennis
team is still winless following its 6-3
defeat to Bucknell University
Sunday.

The Lady Panthers, now 0-3 for
the.l98l campaign, will face Robert
Morris today in an away match.

Against Bucknell, Pitt’s Randi
Belkin easily handled Sarah Krieger
6-2, 6-1 to open the match with a

7» Lady Panther win.

At No.2 singles, Pitt’s Cathy Jac-
obson suffered a rare loss to Buck-
nell’s Patty Koch 7-5, 6-2. For
.Iacobson, who played despite an
illness, it was her first loss this
season.

Pitt freshman Miriam Goltz felt
fine, however, and went on to sur-
prise Laura Kirschstein, handing her

a 6-4, 6-4 loss. It was GoItz's ﬁrstwin
as a Lady Panther.

“Miriam is coming along well.”
said Coach George Dieffcnbach
“She’s gaining more experience and
confidence with every match."

Goltz ‘wasn‘t the only Lady
Panther praised by Dieffenbach.
“Randi (Belkin) played her best
match of the season,” he said.

Belkin teamed with Jacobson in
doubles play to capture Pitt’s third
and final victory of the day, a 6-3.
6-3 win over Krieger and
Kirschstein.

Rounding out the singles compe-
tition were Pitt’s Jan Castory. who
fell victim to Valerie Adelson 6-2.
7-6; Jody Mattioli, playing the No.5
position. who lost to Bucknell’s
Cindy Appel 6-0, 6-I; and Beth
Baughman. who was defeated by
Bucknell’s Mary Sykrowash 6-1, 6-
2. . ‘

Vastory and Baughman teamed
up for Pitt in the NO. 2 doubles slot
but suffered a 6-3, 6—2,loss. Pitt's
Goltz and Mattioli battled with Lisa
Smails and Ann Wilbur, but Buck-
nell‘s team emerged the victors by a
score of 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. ‘

There will be one major difference
for Coach Dieffenbach and the Lady
Panthers as they enter tOday‘s
Robert Morris match. The Lady
Panther’s should benefit from the
play of fifth-year senior Aldene Cliff
Lacaria. Lacaria was declared eligi-
ble to compete for the Lady Pan-
ther tennis team Tuesday by the
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women's eligibility
committee. ‘

Lacaria. who has played three
years of tennis at the college level.
provides the Lady Panthers with
some much-needed depth and expe-
rience.

Field Hockey Team Splits Two

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Sportswriter

The Pitt Lady Panthers field
hockey team evened their season
record at I-I Tuesday evening,drop-
ping a close 3-2 contest to Kent
State.

“We played much better as a unit
in the Kent State loss,“ said coach
Cindy DiGiacomo. “It’s a shame we
had to lose it the way we did."

The Lady Panthers had to come
from behind in the Kent State
match, finding themselves down 2-0
at the half. Kent State struck for a
quick l-0 lead two minutes into the
game, and hit pay dirt again with IS
minutes left in the half.

The Lady Panthers got their two
goals from wings Karen Olsen and

Phyllis Kasuplos to tie the game at
2-2. Kent State made good on a
plenty shot with I5 minutes remain-
ing in the contest to earn the win.

The Lady Panthers had opened
their season with 2-1 win over West
Virginia Wesleyan last Thursday.
DiGiacomo is very optimistic about
the home opener tomorrow against
Slippery Rock State College.

The season opener against West
Virginia Wesleyan was called “a
great defensive effort”. by DiGia-
como. Although West Virginia Wes-
Ieyan was able to control most ofthe
game, Pitt‘s defense held them to
one goal. An McCloskey put a shot
in the goal for W V U in the opening
minutes of the first half. Pitt
bounced back to even the score at
I-I with a goal by Karen Olsen. The

score stood at I-I at halftime.

Dee Dee Kantner scored the win-
ning goal for Pitt with I0 minutes
left in the contest.

“Dee Dee and Sue Shaheen
played great all-around ﬁeld hockey
for us, and I was impressed with the
freshman," said DiGiacomo. “The
defense is comprised almost entirely
of freshman. and they hung in their
well.”

The Slippery Rock game looks to
be a thriller for the home opener.
Although Pitt won the encounter
last year by a 3-1 score, it is always
rough to play “the Rock.”

“Slippery Rock has always been
an aggressive team," says DiGia-
como. “They have all the fundamen-
tal skills needed. It should be a real
test for the squad."

Seating Plan: Pitt’s Last Choice

continued from page sixteen
Pitt currently charges $ll per seat to
its football games.

Reaction thus far to the new sys-
tem has been “positive,” according
to Billick, although he admitted at
first that it was “somewhat ofa pub-
lic relations problem." Many people
objected to the plan in principle, Bil-
lick said, but they understood the
need to generate additional revenue.

Bob Heddleston, executive direc-
tor of the Golden Panthers, echoed
BiIlick’s comments. He said people
were upset with the change at first.
Now the public has become con-
cerned with improving the position
of their seats.

Several fans at Saturday's game
said their seats were better than in
past seasons -and that they didn’t
think the required donation was too
much.

Their comments, however, were
not all positive.

One 20-year season-ticket holder
at Saturday's Cincinnati game said

 

Olordache
0H.I.S. "Chic"
‘Wrangler

that fans who have supported the
team for 25 or 30 years should have
been exempt.

Another fan said the university
should make public financial state-
ments and reports on whether
student-athletes are making the
grade in the classroom.

Billick noted that a clause
exempting fans who have been
season-ticket holders for IS years or
more was considered, but it was
turned down after a debate.

For generating revenue, priority
seating has done as expected so far.

The revenues for athletic fund
raising this fiscal year are approxi-
mately $650,000, up from $450,000
in I980, according to John Blanton,
director of business and manage-
ment for the athletic department
Blanton credited the $200,000 in-
crease to to priority seating.

He added that if priority seating
were maximized, it could bring in up
to $850,000.
