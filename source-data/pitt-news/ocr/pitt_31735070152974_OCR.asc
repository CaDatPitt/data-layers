Dismissal of faculty member sparks debate over adjunct salaries

Danielle‘ Fox
Senior Staff Writer

When Sandra Saba found out the University
did not rehire her favorite professor, Bobbie
Jo Duffy, she began demanding answers from
Pitt’s administration about transparency. Saba
asked for better treatment of adjuncts and,
above all, the return of Duffy to the American
Sign Language department.

Duffy worked at Pitt for ﬁve years as an
adjunct professor and signed aone-semester
contract in August 2013 as a part-time lecturer
to teach American Sign Language in the fall
2013 semester.

The University informed Duffy in Novem-
ber 2013 that her contract would not be re-
newed for the spring semester. Duffy, however,
is not alone in this position.

Long-term contracts are hard to come
by in academia. According to the American
Association of University Professors, more
than 50 percent of all higher—education faculty
hold part-time appointments, and 76 percent
of all instructional staff appointments are for
non—tenure-track positions.

The AAUP recommended that no more
than 15 percent of instruction within an

institution and no more than 25 percent of
instructionwithinadepartmentbe from non-
tenure-track faculty.

According to the 2013 Pitt Fact Book, 621
out of 1,163 total Pitt faculty were non-tenure
track at the time of its publication. Out of the
621 faculty members, 417 had part-time con-
tracts. .

According to Robin Clarke, a lecturer in

- the English department and also a member

of the Volunteer Organizing Committee of
the Adjunct Faculty Association, roughly
68 faculty members in her department last
year were part-time, 36 were full—time, non-
tenure-stream faculty members and between
50 and 60 were in the tenure stream. Tenure
stream faculty members include part-time

faculty and full—time faculty on the track for '

tenure, which is, according to Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
Faculty Affairs website, ‘.‘a status accorded to
members of the University faculty who have
demonstrated high ability and achievement
in their dedication to the growth of human
knowledge.” Tenure assures the University
that there will be a continuity in its experi-
enced faculty and in the functions for which

Legacy status an added bonus for college students

Chris Puzia
Staff Wrz'ter

Whenjamie Cooperwas applyingto colleges,
she had a decision to make: whether or not
she would consider Pitt simply because her
family’s two preceding generations attended
the school.

Pitt accepted her application, and she
enrolled at Pitt over her other top choice,
Virginia Tech. While her family encouraged
her decision, she didn’t feel pressured to at-
tend her father’s alma mater.

“My parents were pretty cool about it,”
said Cooper, a freshman engineering major.
“They didn’t pressure me, but I felt in the
back of my mind that if I chose Pitt, it would
make them happier.”

Cooper is just one of many students who
faced the decision during the college appli-
cation process whether to apply and attend
one of their family member’s alma maters.
For some, legacy could factor into the ad-

missions and enrollment process as well as
joining Greek life. '

While some studentsfeel pressure from
their families to consider their own ﬁiture
alma maters, not all of them take itinto ac-
count when making the decision. ‘

For Cooper, her parents didn’t inﬂuence
her as vigorously as her grandparents did.

“My grandparents were so gungho about
Pitt,” she said. “I felt like if I applied here, it
would please my grandparents. It wasn’t at
the top of my list at ﬁrst, but I still am glad
I applied.”

Much of the consideration also depends
on geography.

Cooper’s grandparents on her father's
side grew up in the Pittsburgh area, and her
paternal grandfather was a professor at Pitt,
drawing her father in to attend the University.
While Cooper grew up in Baltimore, much 0
her family still had ties to Pitt. ‘

“So many people came here,” she said.
“Aunts and uncles and great uncles. We vis-

ited here a lot when I was a kid, so it kind of
becamea familiar home away from home.”
Many high school students apply to their

parents’ alma maters because of the advan-.

tage that admissions oﬂices grant legacy
students.

Marc Harding, chief enrollment officer
at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions,

said-he thinks legacy can give a candidate a"

“plus factor,” but not a singular qualiﬁer for
admission. Academic achievement, Harding
said, is the most important factor.

“If two students have similar characteris-
tics, and one is a legacy, that is a plus factor,
and we consider that,” he said.

Harding said the review board that

oversees applications doesn’t differentiate ‘

between whether an applicant’s parents or
grandparents attended Pitt. He added that
the board considers the legacy factor, while
ambiguous, more to separate similarly quali-
ﬁed candidates than to grant an advantage to
someone who does not deserve admission.

Nicholas Weltz also came to Pittas a legacy
student, but through a different path. Weltz
enrolled at SUNY—Stony Brook in NewiYork

A his freshman year, but decided to transfer to

Pitt, where both ofhis parents and his mater-
nal grandparents attended.

“I almost chose to go to Virginia Tech,
mostly to be with my girlfriend at the time,
a decision my parents were disappointed
with,” Weltz, a junior political science major,

said in an email.

“They heavily pushed for me to reconsider
and go to Pitt,” he said. “The school has a
certain sentimental value to me because of
my family’s long—standing connection to it.”

. Harding said admitted legacy students
are more likely to enroll intheir parent’s alma
mater once accepted when compared to most
students.

“Children of legacies deﬁnitely yield a

Professors embrace software meant to combat plagiarism

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Jonathan Misurda was grading a student’s
computer programming assignment a few
years ago when he noticed something odd.

A line of code the student had osten-
sibly written contained the last name of a
student who had been in one of Misurda’s
previous courses.

“It was not a common last name,”
Misurda said, and it indicated that some
of his students were passing around old
coursework.

While educators often rely on their
instincts to spot students’ attempts to
cheat, some are using online programs
to help them hone in on work students
might have copied from one another or
plagiarized from published texts without
adding citations.

Pitt maintains licenses that allow
instructors to use two such services -
Turnitin and Safeassign — to check work
students submit.

Cynthia Golden, director of the Cen-
ter for Instructional Development 8: Dis-
tance Education, said such services are
becoming increasingly popular among
instructors at the University, and about
150 instructors use Turnitin in a given
semester. She based this estimate on the
number of accounts instructors set up to
use the service in their courses.

While it would be harder to ﬁnd the
number of instructors who use Safeassign,
another service independently available
to instructors through Courseweb, Pitt
instructors are showing a growing interest
in the online services. .

“I can say for sure that there has been
increased interest in these tools during
the last year,” Golden said in an email.
“Our educational technology center has
been getting more inquiries about it than
in the past.”

Turnitin and Safeassign operate simi-
larly, pointing out sections of students’
work that resemble other authors’ work.

Educators who use the services can up-

load students’ work themselves or require
students to post their own work.

The services check students’ submis-
sions against sources publicly available
through Internet searches and their own
databases of published work, which in-
clude sources such as journals and periodi-
cals, according to each respective website.
Both services also store old assignments
to compare them with subsequent sub-
missions.

The services then generate reports that
ﬂag matches between students’ work and
other text. it .

The programs do occasionally produce
false matches. _ '

According to an Inside Higher Ed re-
port from 2009, researchers at Texas Tech
University found that the services, espe-
cially Turnitin, frequently ﬂagged non-
plagiarized-work because of coincidental
similarities to other texts.

But Chris Harrick, vice president of
marketing for iParadigms, the company
that owns Turnitin and is based in Oak-

land, Calif., cautioned against accusing
students of plagiarism based solely on a
report from the service.

“We’re just a tool to detect unoriginal
content,” Harrick said

For_example, a paper might contain
common turns of phrase, or a student

_ might use citations the program doesn’t

recognize. It is up to the instructor to de-
cide whether a student has cheated on an
assignment.

Michael Kessler, the director of un-
dergraduate studies for Pitt’s Depart-
ment of Philosophy, said that an instruc-

, tor wouldn’t accuse a student of cheating

because a single sentence resembled one
found in text elsewhere.

“If big chunks of it look like they were I

takerrfrom another source, then it prob-
ably is plagiarized,” Kessler said.

While they are not fool-proof, Kessler
said services like Turnitin and Safeassign
automate a process that could take instruc-

Pitt students find young love during years in Oakland

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Amy Longworth met her ﬁancé, Killian By-
rne, in her ﬁrst class at Pitt, Renaissance in
England. Longworth was studying abroad
at Pitt from Exeter University in England.

Longworth, who graduated from Exeter
University injuly 2013 with a degree in Eng-
lish literature, said she and Byrne have been
together for two years and eight months.

Early in her ﬁrst semester, Longworth
invited,Byrne to a party she threw at her
apartment in an attempt to meet new people
at Pitt. Byrne invited her to lunch the next
day and walked her the entire 45 minutes
home afterward.

“He was more interesting to me than
anyone I’d met in Pittsburgh thus far, and
we didn’t stop talking. We became pretty

inseparable after that,” Longworth said ~

in an email.

The majority of students will graduate
from Pitt with a degree and hopefully some
inkling of a life plan, but a few lucky stu-

   

dents graduate with a life partner as well.

According to a report from the Facebook
Data Science Team, a group that analyzes
data compiled on Facebook, 28 percent
of married college graduates attended the
same college. Researchers Sofus Attila Mac-
skassy and Lada Adamic compiled data on
users 25 and older who had listed their alma
mater and were linked to their spouses on
Facebook.

The pair didn’t stop talking after the
walk home, and Byrne proposed while visit-
ing Longworth in England lastjuly.

Longworth said Byrne asked her to

' marry him outside the Exeter Cathedral

as the sun was setting.

“It was perfect. Also, the most wonder-
ful, beautiful thing was that the ring was his
mother’s engagement ring. I cherish it more
than anything,” Longworth said.

The couple has maintained a long-
distance relationship since Longworth
departed from the United States in 2012.
Over the past two years, Byrne has traveled
to England four times, and Longworth has

returned to the United States four times
to visit. _

4 Longworth said being in a long-distance
relationship was not always pleasant or
easy, but always having a trip planned gave
the couple something to look forward to and

leased the stress of the situation.

“We,both made mistakes. We both hurt h

each other. My health suffered and, in
January 2013, Killian’s mom passed away,”
Longworth said. “I can’t explain how heart-
breaking that was. But we got through it
somehow, and I deﬁnitely believe that this
experience has made us much, much stron-
ger as a couple.”

Longworth and Byrne plan to get mar-
ried injune at a small courthouse ceremony
in California and then hold a bigger cer-
emony at Heinz Chapel in the fall of 2015.

Byrne said he thought the opportunity to
get married at Heinz Chapel was “amazing.”

“Honestly, Pitt issuper cool,” he said. “I
love the Cathedral and the Chapel is so nice.”

For another couple, local campus haunts ‘

were launching points for a lasting romance.

Brett Meeder and Katie Ly met through_
a mutual friend at The Perch during their
sophomore year and started dating in 2012
during their senior year.

Ly said that she thought about meeting
someone in collegelbecause her parents met

‘while studying at Temple University, but

Meeder said he had never thought about
marriage before college.

“I honestly don’t know that most people
look for a long-term relationship in college
because of the way the world is now,” Ly
said. “Careers are so importan .”

Meeder graduated from the Swanson
School of Engineering in 2012, and Ly grad-

Jeff Tweedy

June 6

Three Rivers Arts Festival

Jeff Tweedy, the frontman of Wilco, has
never played a solo show in Pittsburgh
before. The band last stopped in town
promoting Wilco (The Album) in 2010.
The band’s been teasing a-new album on
its Facebook page for the past year, so
fans could possibly be treated to some
new material — or a cover of Beyonce’s
“Single Ladies.” Tweedy’s solo shows are
known for a more relaxed coffee—house
atmosphere with a handful of cover songs
and audience requests. Like the other
festival events, Tweedy’s show will be a
free concert in a festival that also features

Luke Bryan
June 21 '
Heinz Field

Luke Bryan will take the stage at Heinz
Field onJun'e 21 this year, taking the place
of the infamous annual Kenny Chesney
concert. His That’s My Kind of Night tour
will also feature Dierks Bentley, Lee Brice
and Cole Swindell.

But will it make a difference whether
or not it__’s Kenny Chesney or Luke Bryan
up on the stage? Of Bryan’s two No. 1 al-
bums last year, both had the word “party”
in the title. Truthfully, the music could
be a sideshow to the tailgate scene, and
country instruments will be minimal in
Bryan’s set. Rock music holds a heavy in-
ﬂuence over this “bro country” superstar,
and the sound of the electric guitarwill

' ring more prominently.than any ﬁddle or

banjo. Nevertheless, Bryan’s show will be
engaging and probably dubbed as charm-

ing by manyconcertgoers.

Dave Matthews Band

June 28

First Niagara Pavillion

Since I’ve‘seen Dave Matthews Band 19

times in concert — and by the end of the
summer, that numberwill rise to 23 times
—— I might be a_little biased in saying that
this could be the best show of the summer.
That being said, I know that Dave, as his
biggest fans casually call him, gets a bad

rap for being an idol to frat boys in cargo ,

shorts and snapbacks. If you ﬁnd that you
can put up with some of those fans, you’ll
be in for a big treat.

This particular summer, DMB will try _

out a new type of tour. A Very Special
Evening with Dave Matthews Band will
feature a two—set show —— one as a tra-
ditional DMB show and one acoustic set.

' Since this is the ﬁrst time the band has V

tried such an event, even the most die-
hard fans have no idea what to expect.
With the tour beginning on May 16 in The

Woodlands, Texas, therewill be plenty of '

time before Dave and his crew arrive in

V Pittsburgh to see what the two—set show '
‘ will actually entail. .

LEGACY

higher rate of enrollment than nonlegacies,”
Harding said. “There are students who do not
want to go where mom or dad wentfrom day
one. But if a student was brought up around
Pitt from day one, it makes more sense that
they would enroll as well.”

Weltz agreed that his parents inﬂuenced
his decision regarding where to transfer, but
with entirely supportive intentions.

“It helped being raised from birth on Pitt

' football games andbasketball,”Weltz said in

an email. “I’d be an idiot to say that applying
and eventually coming here wasn’t inﬂuenced

' by my family having gone as wel .”

In addition to simple parent legacies, some
students choose where they go because of a
parent legacy in a particular sorority or fra-
ternity. '

Samir Daouk, amember ofPi Kappa Alpha
fraternity, said there are cases when students
rush the same fraternity or sorority as their
parents.

“It’s true that many guys try to follow the
family legacy, but every case is circumstan-

tial,” Daouk, a sophomore majoring in eco— v

nomics, said. “Sometimes the organization at
one institution may have a differentchemistry
than another.”

Daouk added that for many students, the

main consideration is chemistry rather than
legacy. - I  ' ..

“No matter what afﬁliafion you may have
with any organization, it’s always best to go to
several different rush events and ﬁnd where
you ﬁt in best,” he said.

For Stephanie Schaller, a legacy of Delta
Zeta, her motheﬁs membership in the same

sorority in college inﬂuenced her decision. _ ,

“Because I am very close with my mother,
I deﬁnitely took her afliliation with DZ into
account when I was choosing between three
sororities,” said Schaller, a junior majoring

. inaccounting.

Schaller said that outside pressure some-
times contributes to whether someone re-
ceives a bid, but added that regardless of

legacy, sororities should allow for an equal

playing ﬁeld. '

“I thinklegacies should be given the ‘same
consideration as nonlegacies,” she said. “But
because of pressure from nationals [national
sorority ofﬁces], they are given preferential
consideration.”

While havingaparentlegacyinafraternity
helps a pledge’s chances of receiving a bid,
Daouk said it will not automatically guar-
antee one. '

“It’s not necessarily a guarantee, but it deﬁ-
nitely can help,” he said. “Being affiliated with

someone who_has been a part of a ﬁaternityis _

tradition can help shape them intoan ideal

PLAGIARISM

tors much longer to perform without them.
Turnitin takes an average of 25 seconds to
compare a student’s paper with the materi-
als in its databases, submissions from oth-
ers in the same course and online sources,
according to information on its website.
Carol Bové, a senior lecturer in Pitt’s
department of English, said she is consid-
ering using Turnitin next fall to save time

as she grades papers, but said she stillhas '

reservations about the service.

She said she worries that using the ser—
vice might give students the impression
she is suspicious of them and might upset
the delicate “atmosphere of trust” that
helps students learn.

But Panos Chrysanthis, a computer sci-
ence professor, said such services hold
one advantage for educators who must
confront students who might have cheated:

Students can’t claim they have been un-

fairly singled out.

“The great thing about these automated
tools is that you cannot blame the TA or

Writing-intensive disciplines are .not
the only areas whereginstmctors are using
online programs to check for plagiarism.

Misurda, a computer science lecturer,
said he has previously used Moss, a service
available to educators for free on Stanford
University’s website, during two or three
semesters while he taught computer en-
gineering.

The program allows instructors to sub-
mit the computer programming students
have handed in and then compares the
assignments to one another.

In programming assignments, some
students might take code from their peers
and then change superﬁcial elements of

it to make it look like their own work, ac-

cording to Misurda.

Such shallow changes might escape a
cursory inspection by a grader. But when
substance of the program — the portion
that includes instructions for the com-
puter —— matches the work, Moss would
recognize these similarities immediately,
according to Misurda.

He added that, as with the case when
he recognized the name of one of his old

students in someone else’s work, educators
can often spot cheating without software.

“[Moss] is really about verifying an in-
stinct and catching things that are a little
more subtle,” he said.

Bové said that she has entered text
from students’ papers into a search en-
gine when she’s suspected that parts had
been plagiarized. For example, a paper
that seems more polished than she would
expect might make her skeptical about
whether it is the student’s own work.

“Oftentimes, it doesn’t turn anything
up,” she said. “But once or twice, it has.”

Like Bové, Misurda said he considers
checking for plagiarism an unpleasant
task that is secondary to his role as an
educator. He said software doesn’t stop
students from getting to the root causes
of cheating. Misurda said he suspects most
students grow desperate when they’re up
against deadlines and then copy work from

V elsewhere despite their better judgment.

“The problem with throwing technol-
ogy at this problem is that it’s not a tech-
nology problem,” he said. “It becomes

Brand New
July 10
Stage AE
Long Island-native band Brand New
have been around since 2000 with a
unique alternative sound that changes
on every album and distinctive lyrics in-
ﬂuenced by Morrissey and The Smiths.
Since their formation — after lead sing-
_er Jesse Lacey angrily left Taking Back
Sunday — they have released four studio
albums with songs such as “Seventy Times
7,” “The Quiet Things that No One Ever

Knows” and “Sowing Season,” and have

sold out numerous shows in Pittsburgh.
Even though the group hasn’t released any
new albums since Daisy in 2009, Brand
New’s premiere at Stage AE will deﬁnitely
be a show to remember, since the band has
only played at Club Zoo in the last three
years. Pittsburgh’s newest venue on the
North Shore always creates an impressive

' atmosphere for any act that plays there.

appointinents, which the Ofﬁce, of the Provost
reviews periodically.

Duffy said it wasn’t her place to encourage
the student’s movements.

“I don’t know even if it will make a differ-
ence. The administration, the faculty—th_ey
have aillthe authority,” Duffy said. “I’m not
important. So, if I ﬁght, I don’t think it will
make a difference.” A

A University—wide issue

Clarke said the exploitation of adjunct
professors is a national problem, and Pitt’s
quality of education and reputation in aca-
demia would beneﬁt from taking a progres-
sive stance.

Part—time professors in the English depart-
ment make $2,700 to $4,100 per semester per
class, and part-time professors can teach up
to two classes a semester, according to Clarke.

Clarke said the University beneﬁts from
the treatment of non—tenure-stream faculty,
and the low salary allows them to ﬁind other

projects.
The AAUP contends that the turn toward
adjunct labor is “largely a matter of priorities,

rather than economic necessity.” The greatest V

growth in contingent appointments occurred
during periods of economic prosperity.
Service said the Ofﬁce of the Provost and
the Council of Deans are currently review-
ing and addressing salary issues in addition
to working with an ad hoc committee of the

University Senate to identify additional con— .

cerns of faculty outside of the tenure stream.
He also said the provost’s ofﬁce and Council of

Deans improved job security by consolidating _

part—time positions into full—time positions,
and the importance of career development
for non-tenure-stream faculty is a priority.

Through Service, Cooper responded to
students by early Friday morning. In a state-
ment emailed to Saba and The Pitt News, Coo-
per said that while the University appreciates
its students’ interest and active engagement
in their education, the administration is not
legally permitted to comment on personnel
decisions.

“-There are thorough and multi—level pro-

‘ cesses for all such decisions, which have been

carefully followed in this instance,” Cooper
said. .
Cooper said the ASL program is ﬁilly
staffed, and the decision to not renew Duffy’s
contractwill have no impact on the program.
Saba said she believes it’s the students’

- right to know the rationale behind person-

nel decisions.

’ “It’s not something [administrators] can
claim as private,” Saba said. “It’s our educa-
tion. We are consumers. We pay them money,

' so we have ajright to know what they are doing

with this money.”

Growing support for adjuncts

Clarke became involved in the movement‘
after Saba, who is a TA for her seminar in
composition class, came into the class livid
about the loss of her professor.

Clarke has athree-year teaching contract
with the University, but said her job doesn’t
have any meaningif it “happened onthe backs
of people who have less.” _

“For every year that I feel comfortable
that I have my job, there are 10 adjuncts in
my department who don’t know if they have
theirs and make half my salary for the‘ same
classes,” Clarke said.

Robin Sowards, an adjunct professor at
Duquesne University and organizer of the
Adjunct Faculty Association, used to be an
adjunct professor at Pitt, butwas not rehired
after the University took his ﬁilly-enrolled
class fromhimand gave itto asenior member.

“We are sort of replaceable parts,” Sowards
said.

The Adjunct Faculty Association, which

A works to improve the working condition of

area and is a chapter of United Steelwork-
ers, helped the students secure funds to pay

While some might have thought it was
more of the same, the stunning visual ef-
fects and real-life chemistry of Andrew

Garﬁeld and Emma Stone as Peter Parker -

and Gwen Stacy made “The Amazing Spi-
der-Man” a unique and fun reboot for the
well—known origin story. It used new mate-
rial from the comics and also raised enough
questions — from the mystery of Peter’s
parents to the truth about Oscorp —— to
separate it from the original trilogy. The
newest trailer for the sequel is overstuffed
with villains, including Electro and Rhino,
but the appearance of the Green Goblin and
the fate of Gwen Stacy should make any

“Boyhood”

“Boyhood,” the latest from Richard Lin-
klater — director of the “Before” trilogy
and “School of Rock” — might not make
it into every multiplex —— if any — this
summer, but it could very well be the most
ambitious nonblockbuster to see release
in the coming months. Linklater’s nearly
3-hour drama took 12 years. to ﬁlm as he
quite literally ﬁlmed the lead character,
Mason (Ellar Coltrane), growing up from
age 5 to 18. With a strong supporting cast,
including Patricia Arquette and Ethan
Hawke as Mason’s parents and heaps of
Sundance buzz, “Boyhood” could shape .
up to be another masterpiece for Linklater
—— and one of the more complex character
studies of the year. .

Whether you’re graduating or still have a

couple years of school left, a road trip is a‘

quintessential American experience. If your
budget has dipped onto the low side after two
semesters of spending, consider these nearby
places that won’t break the bank or your 1998
Ford Escort instead of the traditional cross-
country trailblazing.

Cleveland:

While people tend to have a somewhat
blase attitude toward C-Town, it does have
its redeeming qualities and warrants a stop.
So what is there to do in Cleveland? After

completingatwo-hour drive, perhaps food is .

the ﬁrst thing on your mind. Stop by legend-
ary restaurant The Big Egg and load up ona

. plateful of sausage, eggs sunnyside up and

pancakes doused in maple syrup.

a walk in one of the many Lake Metroparks.

Once you feel you have burned a sufﬁcient
amount of calories, head on over to the Cleve-

than 100 years old, the museum has one of
the most expansive collections of art in the
country, as well as free admission. Be sure to

check out the contemporary art collection, ,

complete with Damien Hirst’s stained glass
made out ofbutterﬂies. Oh, and don’t forget
the Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame.  ’

And if you’re a sports fan, perhaps swing
by a Cleveland Indians game for the complete
American experience.

Detroit: ‘ -

Yes, I did write Detroit — and I don’t
mean Detroit, Ore., (it does exist). Now I’m
not suggesting you stay a week in the strug-
gling city, but hit these hotspots and you will
be glad you braved the stereotypes.

First, stop by the Motown Historical Mu-
seum, the headquarters of Motown record
company and where Marvin Gaye, The Su-
premes and the other hit _bands of Hitsville
USA got their start. '

struggling as a resultof the economy, and
there has been talk of selling some of the col-

city, it’s the Detroit Industry Muralsby Diego .

Rivera. The murals were commissioned by
the museum and reﬂect the industrial past
that deﬁned the city. Take a few minutes to
soak in the details of these overwhelming

the hope the United States had in industry
and technology in years past. 1

Before you depart from the Motor City,

How to stay sane while stuck in the city this summer

Stephanie Roman
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

As ﬁnals week looms, it can occupy the
minds, time and anxieties of all Pitt students.
It’s OK if summer still seems far away — or
maybe it’s all too close.

Perhaps you’re stuck working or taking
classes in the Pittsburgh area this summer.
You might be thinking, “Whatam I going to
do all summer while my friends are gone?”
Don’t worry. Pittsburgh has a humongous
array of art, events, concerts, music, plays
and ﬁlms that you can’t get elsewhere.

You know that Panther Card —- the one
that gets you meals at Market Central, pays
for dinner at Quickzone and even nets you
coffee at Common Grounds? It has a few
other uses as well, such as free bus rides.
Hopefully this is common knowledge, but
those bus rides can lead to even more excit-
ing places, including museums. ti

Obviously, the Carnegie Museum_of Art
and Natural History is located just a couple
of blocks down Forbes Avenue from the Ca-

thedral of Learning,‘ and those  museu_rns_  .

     
 connzn or Amoco &VnA1;'2$l,~:ia.¢_al1.5e§5' ,' T

  .**4°*w<-can 

are so massive that you could likely spend a
week-checking them out.

For the Carnegie initiates, it might be
time to move on to other places such as The
Mattress Factory on the N orth"Side or even
the Andy Warhol Museum across the Warhol
Bridge. The Mattress Factory is a small con-
temporary installation art museum — noth-

S ing like what you’d see at the Carnegie. The

Warhol is a huge collection of Andy Warhol’s
pop art and iconoclasm. For people who like
the greener side of things, take a trip down
to Phipps Conservatory in Oakland. A day
among the ﬂowers and butterﬂies can’t be
a bad one. i

But the absolute can’t-miss event, coming
up June 6-15, is the Three Rivers Arts Festi-
val, sponsored by the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust. Admission is free, so go_'and listen
to the daily live music acts andtjbrowse the
artwork that you probably can’t_aﬁ'ord, but
can at least appreciate. The festival is located

in the very heart of:Pittsburgh, _Cultur_al O
' District. Check out row after row of artists

and vendors, taste some deliciously fried

 

festival food and watch the fountain sparkle
at Point State Park.

Also in the Cultural District, the Benedum
Center will show two Broadway musicals.
First is. “Legally Blonde,” running from
June 13-22, almost immediately followed by
“Footloose,” which will run fro mjune 24-29.
Pittsburgh’s Civic Light Opera, a longstand-
ing and talented non-proﬁt, will stage both
shows, so check them out while they’re here.

But what if you’re more of a sports fan?
Start with the Buccos. The Pirates are coming
off a staggeringly impressive season, and,
for the ﬁrsttime in 20 years, are actually an
exciting team worth rooting for. Every Fri-
day, home games supply free T-shirts to the

. ﬁrst 25,000 fans, so get to PNC Park early.

Some exciting dates include showson May
10,]une 26,July 19 and August 9 — if you’ve
never seen the Zambellis before, you’re in for
a treat. Also, Pirates Fanjam boasts a really
strong contender this summer — the G00

J. Goo Dolls will play after the gamejune 7. '

On the South Side, Station Square has a

multitude .of fun things to check out. There’s A

Chelsea ner

the Duquesne Incline, which slowly elevates

you over the city to the beautiful viewpoint 

of Mount Washington. While you’re up there,
take a good look at the beautiful Highmark
Stadium, home of the Pittsburgh River-
hounds, Pittsburgh’s United Soccer League
professional division men’s soccer team.

And for those working hard this summer ’

and padding their pockets, cruising on one
of the Gateway Clipper Fleet ships might
become tempting. There’s nothing like a
fanciﬁil trip across the Allegheny on a ferry.
Similarly, you can’ also catch ajust Ducky
tour, a delightful excursion around the city
on a hybrid boat—truck vehicle. _

If you’re more of the adventurous type,
there are a few great places to visit. Sand-
castle and Kennywood Park, which are lo-
cated in West Homestead and West Mifflin,

respectively, are two of the best summertime ’

experiences availableto Pittsburghers. Sand-
castle is a decently sized water park, with

2 all the standard attractions: a massive wave

Clarke said the group offered some advice and
showed their support, but said it was largely a
student movement

Jon Sherry, a,Ph.D. student in the history
department, said he came out to the movement
for “so1idarity,’? because “adjunct labor is just
like any other labor.”

Jesse Olsavsky, also a Ph.D. student in the
history department, said he was there to offer
a certain level of “consciousness-raising” and
support. Olsavsky said he was “angered at the
mendacity of ruling instimtions everywhere.”

Olsavsky said to not rehire an exemplary
adjunct professor is “indicative of class strug—
gles.” . _ '

Saba said that while the movement was
founded on the speciﬁc rehire of one profes-
sor, it has become an attempt to “shed light
on the experiences of all adjunct professors.”

When the lesson was signed and done and
the message was heard, Cooper entered his
ofﬁce, and the group signed applause for itself.

But Saba said classwillreconveneinthe fall,

l and the group will continue to ask questions.

Saba said the class was only the ﬁrst step.

“We won’t just say that’s sad and move on
with our lives,” Saba said. “When we come
back in the fall, [administration] can expect
us to continue the ﬁght for a response and the
ﬁght foradjunct faculty.” I

Finding your place in college: Be your own Pathfinder  

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

Have you ever had those moments when,
as they’re happening, you realize you will
look back on them?

That moment for me occurred during
my PittStart while I waited for my ﬁrst ad-

' vising appointment. A recent graduate sat

down next to me and said, “I would kill to

' be in your position right now.”

‘ Just a-heads up: If you don’t want togread A
a\mushy Pitt memoir, you’re looking atfa
baby—food level of mush in the paragraphs
ahead. . '

It was really strange to hear her say that
because even she could tell that I wasn’t
having the glorious day that everyone else
seemed to be having. While everyone gig-
gled over icebreaker exercises and meeting
new people, I felt completely isolated. I
hated ﬁguring everything out on my own
and no one really caring whether I was in
the right place or notI‘I remembered the

April 21, 2014 | The Pitt News I \/vvvvv.pittnelws.com

anxiety I felt simply looking for classrooms
in high school, and this was that anxiety
times 10. Picking classes, meeting new

' people, explaining to my adviser what ex-

actly I was trying to get out of the next four
years in my life and all while basically alone.
How were people so thrilled about this?

I forget exactly what this new grad said
to me —— something about how I would
soon ﬁnd my place and that the next four
years would be a blink. Whatever cheesy
encouragement she gave me at the time,
though her enthusiasm really didn’t match
my mood, her prediction was completely

correct. Despite the fact that I spent a lot-

of time alone during my early semesters,
navigating my undergraduate career with
new conﬁdence, I did ﬁnd my place. And

it really has been a blink.

What- exactly did I do during this blink?
I can" essentially split it into three major

. lessons that Pitt has taught me, but they

all depended on me essentially becoming
my own Pathﬁnder (I warned you about

the mush). I ﬁgured that the ﬁrst item on
the agenda was to get friends because “you
make the best friends of your life in college,”
as the saying goes. That, and all my high
school friends were constantly Skyping me
and telling me about how much -they love
their new groups at their small liberal arts
colleges within the ﬁrst two weeks, while I
was picking seats at Market Central suited
for a party of one. So I talked to everyone
and asked where they were from, the whole
“I make a stupid joke and laugh and you
make a stupid joke andlaugh” routine as if I
would ﬁnd the best friends of my life social-
izing like I was at a suburban open house.
' But after a few weeks of dissatisfaction
with my fake self, I eventually realized that
I wasn’t going to ﬁnd genuine friends if I

didn’t behave genuinely. One of the ﬁrst ,

things that Pitt taught -me was to be myself
— a person, not a college-bubble—enclosed
freshman covered in blue and gold. Truth-
ﬁilly, I’m a dry person who doesn’t ﬁnd
every joke funny and sometimes can go a

25

day without smiling at all — and I really
don’t get along with every single person
the way Iwas making it seem. Taking off
that costume was a relief, and even more
of a reliefwas the fact that I found genuine

people almost immediatelyafterward. Once I -_

I started acting like a normal person, not
someone who was ﬁlled with Pitt spirit and
energized with the thrill of being on my
own, I found some genuine people who
acted the same way. ’

Let me take a moment to point out one of
my favorite things about Pitt: This univer-

sity doesn’t use its name to brand and label '

its students like typicallstate schools, but
instead becomes the medium for a really
diverse group'of people without attempting

to instill a single identity. You meet people .-
from hundreds of miles away and fellow _

Pittsburgh natives like me: art enthusiasts
and sports fans, computer nerds and lay-
in—the-grass philosophers, Urban Outﬁtters

a typical Pitt student.” There’s nothing that
deﬁnes you as a Pitt student except yourself.
Along with all of this soul-searching

3 4

came another important task: the eloquent-
ly titled agenda of “do stuff.” You quickly
learn from studying in a city environment
to embrace constantly moving and being
active in organizations. While this is some-

36

thing that all universities encourage, more
or less, there’s something very particular

that I have to attribute strictly to Pitt once
again. -Unlike the small schools or large
state schools that basically ensure you have
some campus function to attend at all times,
Pitt urges you to take advantage of awide
arena of activities, both on campus and off.

‘ l P l   it  much had student life ﬁgured out — I had

i ers. Pitt builds a certain type of person: —

something to do all the time, but within
that complacency you ﬁnd yourself look-
ing for more. - V

V I recall realizing one Friday afternoon

while running through the Schenley trails I

behind my house that there’s one more
step besides all the extracurriculars and
academic work that I need to take, and the
answer hit me in the cheesiest, most movie-
esque way. I started rounding a corner of the
trail where you can see a decent glimpse of
the downtown skyline, and it hit me: I need

to associate myself, outside of Pitt, with the ' V

city of Pittsburgh.‘

That day, I sent in an application for an '

internship and soon found myselfworking
for a nonproﬁt legal organization for the
following seven months. This is how Pitt
taught me my ﬁnal lesson.

When you live in Oakland, you really
start to see that line of privilege that most
universities don’t explicitly offer. Lacking a
typical campus has made it difficult to live in
a college bubble because you’re constantly
reminded of the real world without meal
plans andwith more responsibilities than a
syllabus. And to be around people with the
same privileges makes you appreciate yours
and use your time to help others —_- at least,

that’s what I found. Pitt has a community ' u
_ that makes you realizethe position you’re‘

in and realize that you’re sharing a city-with
many who aren’t in it. I

In the end’, I really want to extend a _

hugelthank you to you, Pitt, for not pay-
ing very much attention to me. You didn’t
ensure that I made friends the ﬁrst day, or
suggest clubs and classes to ﬁt into some
preconceived idea of success. You made

me struggle and ﬁgure these things out by
myself, pushed me to deﬁne myself as a per-
son, not simply as a student in a university. i

I’m glad you didn’t hold my hand or tell me,
who to become, but instead, decided to trust
me to do that on my own. I haveto say that

I’m pretty pleased with what I’ve done for
myself. You were the stepping stone to my‘.

becoming anlopen, adventurous, original
person, and that’s an attitude I’H carry as

I long as I’m a Pitt alumna.

To those of you who still have time on

It's been real, it’s been fun: Saying goodbye to college life

Julia Carpey

Columnist

Amid the pictures of Bigelow Bash,
when students started enjoying the
first days of spring and began near-
ing graduation, my Facebook newsfeed
became filled with nostalgic posts. I
can smell the beer from the statuses
screaming, “I’m drinking every night
from now until graduation. Holla at
me,” while others shed a few tears: “It
is only when we become aware that our
time is limited that we can channel our
energy into truly living.” Arid the sim-
plest status of all, “1o days!”

The countdown "began back at the
100—day mark and has now been re-
duced to hours, minutes and seconds.
For me, this countdown is filledwith
the same giddiness a 4-year-old feels
when watching “Frozen.” I’m excited to
close this chapter, shut this door and
put Pitt in my rearview mirror.

‘ Oh, come on. I know I’m not the only I

one.

The University of Pittsburgh bro-
chure, like every other brochure sell-
ing any experience, touts a promising,
perfect four years ahead of each pro-
spective student. But what they don’t
advertise is that these perfect four years
are not ﬁlled with perpetual positivity.
We might have a great couple of weeks,
months in a row or, if we’re lucky, a
whole solid year withouta major hic-
cup. We might be elected officers of our
clubs -or student organizations, score
internships —— good and bad — in which
we learn a lot. We might sail through
all four years with a high GPA, gradu-
ate with accolades and find the love of
our lives.

We might just have a bunch of great
weekends with .our friends. In I the
spring we might kick back on Soldiers
8: Sailors, basking in the two days of
perfect weather before it dips back into
the 40s before finally tucking ourselves

in Sunday night, feeling like everything
is right in the world. But these moments
of high victory are ﬂeeting.

And they should be.

I spent half of my freshman year in
bed with scarlet fever and mono -—— yes,
scarlet fever, the disease Beth from Lit-
tle Women died from at 14 years old —
and the other half pledging a sorority.’

With the exception of a few constant
faces throughout all four years I, like
many people, chose to surround my-
self with people who understood, gave
insight and were the right fit for that
given moment in my life. While some
people might walk away with a group of
friends they connected with freshman
year, most people will walk away with
three, four or even ﬁve good friends
from college. And I personally feel like
that’s how it’s supposed to be. If you
can’t let goof some pieces of your past,
you won’t be able to march into the rest
of your life without feeling a pang of

nostalgia wherever you go.

We’ve all had some signiﬁcant shifts
in our lives in the past four years. While
some experiences are not as relatable as

others, the roller-coaster college expe— V

rience is one we’re all riding together.

To be honest, what I’ll remember
most when I leave Pitt will not be my
academic experience -—— with the excep-
tion of Peter Trachtenberg’s and Cindy
Skrzycki’s classes. I know I’ll look back
and see all of the major dips, but what
I’ll see more glaringly will be the lessons
I learned and the perspective I gained

‘ from them along with the friends, fac-

ulty and professors with whom I con-
nected through the good and the bad.

My past four years were perfect be— _

as

cause of their flaws. The paw prints 1

indelibly left on me were stamped with
conviction — some done carelessly in
passing, some painfully seared over

Nkanata wraps up decorated

Pitt career, sets lympic goals

Garvin Nkanata won the 200-meter ACC title two times. Bobby Mizia |Visua| Editor

Dan Sostek
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

’It doesn’t exactly take much to know"

that Carvin Nkanata is one ofthe best
in the world. Just look at the stopwatch.

On March _15, Nkanata, a Pitt track
and ﬁeld sprinter, ﬁnished running the
2oo—meter dash, and the stopwatch read
20.52 seconds — the fourth fastest time
for the event at the NCAA indoor ﬁnals.

“It felt really good,” said Nkanata,‘

the senior from Summerville, S.C. “It
let me know that all the work I’ve put in
since September was worth it. I’m using
it as continued motivation.”

On Saturday, Nkanata followed
his ACC title from the winter indoor
200-meter by winning-the 200-meter
outdoor race at the‘ACC champion-
ships in Chapel Hill, N.C. In his two

years at Pitt, he now ownstwo Big East
20o—meter championships and two ACC
200—meter championships. V
A week after setting the third best
time, 45.46 seconds, at the Tennes-
see Relays, Micah.Murray and Charles
Ross along with anchoring senior Bry-
cen Spratling — whose 45.59—second
40o~meter dash earned a gold medal
and markedlthe fourth-fastest time in
the country — Nkanata helped earneda
silver medal in the 4x400 meter relays.
The team’s time of 3:05.94 was 0.05 sec-
onds behind ﬁrst-place North Carolina.
Pitt head coach Alonzo Webb said he
didn’t knowthat Nkanata had this level

of potential when he transferred from

Iowa Central two years ago. Webb even
had doubts that anyone else knew.

PALLI

Tell the whole story: qualitative evaluations lacking in academia

Rohith Palli
Columnist

Finals week hasfeome. Evaluations are in

the air. Perhaps some want their grades to
be as objective as possible, to reflect the
precise proportion of the course material
that they acquired from their semester. On
the other hand, many students probably

mostly care about maximizing their GPA. -

Since the era of Galileo ,—-who mea-
sured time by the fall of watér}f:i—‘ ”sophis5-'

ticated methods of measureinent and 
evaluation have been developed;iWithithMis.  
increased precision has come a willingness 
to benchmark. For instance, we can now-

reliably measure fuel efﬁciency and more

ﬁiel-efficient cars are considered s‘_upe-if

rior to their gas—guzzling counterparts,
all other factors held constant. ‘
These measures, however, often do not
reﬂect priorities. In fact, they are all too
often over—weighted, considering what
they can actually tell us. We default to what

we can measure, rather. than what we re-
ally care about. '

A Nonetheless, we are now so good
at evaluating and quantifying that we
often evaluate people in the same way,
especially on their performance in tasks
such as teaching, learning or retrieving
warehouse items. In college, ﬁnals probe
performance based on course objectives,
while standardized tests measure perfor-

» mance against a certain set curriculum.

Even if we think these tests ‘do, in fact,’
measure mastery of some set of material,

“we have to ask the question: What is educa-
tion actually for? If the answerjsuggests

that we should not teach the curriculum,
but rather develop the learner or facilitate

T avbroader process ofmaturation, then per-
_h:ap’_s~these tests do not reﬂect the larger

priorities of education as a whole.
This is a critical point. A property of

able factors inﬂuence measurable known
quantities, we can use large and repeated
measurements of these known quantities
to predict the inﬂuence of the underlying,
unmeasurable factors. When it comes to
tests, especially standardized tests, we
are using a single measurement — rather
than a large set — to predict underlying
knowledge. ' e

The Atlantic and other news media
like to make ﬁgures they claim explain
the world “in one simple graph.” Rarely,
however, can one simple graph accurately

' paint even a piece of the picture; reality

is too complicated. Sometimes processes
just aren’t suited for measurement. More
often, even the most careful quantitative
evaluation misses a key variable. A fresh-
man statistics class might point out that ice
cream sales are correlated with homicide
rates, but not because ice cream causes
homicide.

Early reports of the top 1 percent of the
income distribution receiving an outsize

share of income gains missed that an even
smaller group, the .1 or .01 percent of earn-
ers, actually absorbed most of that growth.
Numbers can tell us something about the
world, but only if treated with caution and

‘ extreme skepticism.

The use of GDP per capita as a measure

q of economic success of a nation is an ex-

ample of such a measurement. GDP per
capita gives the average “productivity”
or wealth creation of each member of a
nation, but this only reﬂects how much
stuff we make, not how it is divided or how

it impacts our quality of life.

The measure doesn’t reﬂect the status
of the environment, security, health, con-
nectedness or happiness, —— all of which
should be higher societal priorities than
simply more stuff, since the goal of accu-
mulation of material wealth is traditionally
to secure a subset of these things — health,
physical security and happiness. '

This year3s draft should solidify both
recognitions. Former Pitt players Aaron

PECYNA

The importance of sports: an offer

Tyler Pecyna
Sports Editor

You should care about sports whether
you’ve read this section or not.

Maybe you don’t have a favorite team
or player or can’t name an example of
either. Maybe you don’t support the mil-
lions of dollars tied to sports. Or maybe
you just haven’t made it all the way to
the back section of the paper before.

But even if you haven’t followed
along with our coverage of Pitt sports
this year, know that sports still matter,
that there is a reason for a story about
the wrestling team clinching a share
of the ACC title appearing in the same
issue there’s a story about Patrick Gal-
lagher being named the 18th chancellor
ofthis school. .

Forget the idea that coverage is com-
pletely based on revenue sports. These
athletic competitions have survived
alongside actual tragedy and warfare
because they’re a scaled—down version

of drama, withlittle serious conse-
quences. They’re an escape, a healthy
competition, that yields an objective,
be it positive or negative.

And this has always been the case,
even at Pitt. ' .

When the draft coinciding with
World War I pulled young American
men from their homes, colleges across
the country adopted the Student Army
Training Corps, made up of students
who volunteered to be on active duty
at all times.

O_f the 34-some men on Pitt’s football
team in 1918, 16 were involved in the
corps. Ajstory from the Pittsburg Dis-
patch explained that the corps desired
football-players because of “their natu-
ral training, fearleslsness and physical
qualifications.

“Naturally, these men are among the

first to be sent to camps for intensive

training, and in consequence, a football
coach is liable to wake up some bright
morning and discover [that] four or

ﬁve of his best men have been taken

When publicgatherings weren’t

- banned and the school wasn’t quaran-

tined because of the outbreak of the ﬂu,‘

Pitt was playing football — and doing
so quite well. A game was scheduled
between Pop Warner’s Panthers and
John ‘I-Ieisman’s Georgia Tech Yellow
Jackets —_— the presumed two most'tal—
ented teams in the country'— solely to
apply the proceeds to the United War
Work Campaign’s athletic funds.
Almost a century later, the Panthers
— this time the basketball team —
played in the midst of incessant bomb
' threats during the 2011-2012 school
year, givinglthe more than 195,000 fans
who attended games at the Petersen
Events Center a sense of certainty.
_Regardless of how the contest ended
for Pitt, students could leave the game
knowing whether their team won or
lost. '

When they’d return home, there was

of, refuge, certainty  

no way of knowing if another born
threat would cancel classes. 0
We give sports teams the pulpit to
speak for a city or a school — like how
David'Ortiz comforted, inspired and
engaged Boston at Fenway Park .after

last year’s Boston Marathon bombings. ‘

Red Sox fans attended that game, just

‘days after the tragedy, looking for a

distraction from reality.

But you can’t escape reality..You can
only temporarily substitute it with a
happier scenario. . . ‘ a

Sports have been that happier sce-
nario. But even when you see the ob-
jective ﬁnal score, it doesn’t tell the
story. The result was just an aggregate
of performance—based subjectivity. Did
the pitcher throw hard enough to miss
the hitter’s bat? Did the offensive line-
man set enough of a block to keep the
defenderlfrom his quarterback?

At the time these small events hap-‘ .

said. “That’s where it would start for Aaron

S Donald, but it might actually start higher

than that.”

Davis noted that the Detroit Lions could
welcome Donald with open arms at No.
10. After all, Lions general manager Mar-
tin Mayhew recently announced that his
front office won’t exercise defensive tackle
Nick Fairley’s $5.5 million option for 2015,
providing an excuse for bringing Donald
to Motown.

“Donald could be a guy who they might
make a move on right then and there,” Da-
vis continued, while adding the New York
Giants at No. 12, St. Louis Rams at No. 13
and the Dallas Cowboys at No. 16 as other
possible destinations.

Each year, only a limited number of
draft prospects receive invitations to at-
tend the draft, annually held at New York
City’s Radio City Music Hall.

Last year, a total of 23 players accepted
invitations to attend the draft, and 19 of
those players were selected in the ﬁrst

Donald reportedly received an invita-
tion to join Goodell and company for the
nationally televised jamboree, but Donald
respectfully declined the offer,

Savage, another former Panther, re-
ceived an invitation, as well.

Savage’s agent hasn’t revealed if his cli-
ent will attend, but he’s been viewed as a
“sleeper” in the eyes of many scouts, prob-
ably because of underwhelming statistics in
his senior season at quarterback — 2,958
yards, 21 touchdowns and nine intercep-
tions — because of a poor offensive line.

“He took a lot of sacks, and I kind of
worried about his ability to just navigate
within the pocket, to get out of trouble,”
NFL Network analyst Danieljeremiah said".

Savage was sacked 43 times —- the most
of any Division I quarterback.

“I look at what happens whenthings are
muddy around them, not when things are
clean. At the NFL level, you’re not going to
have clean pockets consistently like that.
That was my concern with him. I watched

- some later tape on him, and Iwatched him

get out of trouble a little bit. He isn’t quite
as immobile as I ﬁrst thought,” Jeremiah,

WI H ARTS '

a former scout, added.

Before Savage took part in the NFL com-
bine for quarterbacks on Feb. 23, many
projected the 6-foot—5, 230-pounder to be
taken as late as the sixth round.

Since the combine, Savage has been
raided with a series of meetings and work-
outs with various teams, and his stock has
skyrocketed. He was even pinned as “the
hottest guy in the draft,” by NFL.com’s Gil
Brandt. 1

Savage was not available for comment
because of his busy schedule.

“You can tell there’s buzz and some ex-
citement building on with the number of

e teams talking to him and working [him]

out,” Jeremiah said. “That’s hard data
there.”

ESPN’s Todd McShay has Savage going
33rd — the ﬁrst selection in the second
round — to former Penn State coach Bill
O’Brien and the Houston Texans.

“I think he ﬁts in with what Bill O’Brien
wants to do,” Jeremiah added.

~ In a correlating effort, McShay projects
the Texans to take former South Carolina
defensive endJadeveon Clowney with the
ﬁrst overall pick, a move that could help

Savage’s case.

If Houston selects quarterbacksJohnny
Manziel or Teddy Bridgewater ﬁrst overall,
the Texans will not need a quarterback
when round two rolls around. -

Jeremiah said that if the Texans pass on
Savage, he could be snagged by the Jack-
sonville Jaguars at N o. 39.

“[Jaguars] GM David Caldwell has spent
time with Peyton Manning in Indianapolis

and Matt Ryan in Atlanta, so a pure pocket ‘- *

passer could be an option for them, as well,”
Jeremiah said, listing Savage’s strengths as
arm strength, accuracy and pass velocity.

If Savage gets drafted, he would become
only the second Pitt quarterback in 31 years
to do so. .

' Savage’s No. 1 wide receiver target in
2013, Devin Street, caught 53 passes and
became Pitt’s all-time leading receiver. The
6-foot-4 athlete opened some scouts’ eyes
during his combine day. I

Street leaped 37 inches in the vertical
jump (14th place of 37 contestants), com-
pleted the 20-yard shuttle in 4.01 seconds
(T—eighth) and he extended 10.33 feet in

PAT’S TENSE

Pitt sports: passing disappointment, suffering between generations

Patrick McAteer
Editor in Chief

There’s something about being a Pitt
sports fan that I just can’t explain.

Maybe it’s the inferiority complex
we’ve all adopted as a result of being
surrounded by Penn Staters and their
unhealthy obsession with their football
team. Or perhaps it’s the villains we’ve
established: Todd Graham, Khem Birch
and Rushel -Shell.

The relationship between me, my
father and Pitt athletics has been in-
credibly personal. Since I was 11 years
old, my dad and I have attended Pitt
football and basketball games, putting
ourselves in a state of misery each and
every year. Pitt would break our hearts
and then provide us with nuggets that
brought us back. It was an unbreakable
cycle, it seemed.

Take, for instance, Pitt’s loss against
Butler in the second round ofthe NCAA

Tournament in 2011. Pitt entered the
tournament as a No. 1 seed, and most
analysts considered the Panthers a le-
gitimate national-title contender. Pitt’s
bracket was arguably the weakest among
all No. 1 seeds. This was it — our year.
That hope, of course, came to a

- screeching halt as Pitt forward Nasir

Robinson fouled But_ler’s Gordon Hay-
ward, sending him to the foul line, where
he would nail two shots to win_the game.

In my Sutherland East dorm room, ‘

_I fell to my knees and buried my face
in my hands. What did Pitt fans do to
deserve this? ,

I called my dad, whom I blame for
turning me into a Pitt sports fan, and
asked him the same question: Why Pitt?

- My dad, as he almost always does,
replied succinctly: “I’m not a supersti-
tious person, but I think we’re -cursed.”

“Cursed” was a word that was uttered
many times throughout my four years at
Pitt. Remember the loss to Youngstown

State in football in Paul Chryst’s first
game as head football coach. Or Pitt

basketball losing the two most highly-

recruited players in programhistory,
Khem Birch and Steven Adams, preemp-
tively? '

All of these experiences were no
doubt awful, but one game during my
junior year at Pitt deﬁnedmy relation-
ship with the University’s teams.

When Pitt’s football team fell to Notre
Dame in triple overtime during my junior
year after kicker Kevin Harper missed
two chip-shot field goals that would’ve
given the Panthers an upset victory over
a team _ranked No. 3 in the country, I
left my Ward Street apartment and went
on a walk, hoping to find someone who
shared my frustration. A

To me, it always seemed as though
the average Pitt student was apathetic
about the football team, but this time, I
heard that ‘C’-word everywhere I walked,
from the entrance of Peter’s Pub to the

Cathedral of Learning.

Once again, I called my dad, ho"ping°
fpr.some kind words. He had just fin-
ished watching the game, having DVR—
ed it. This time, he was truly at a loss_
for words: “I don’t understand why this
keeps happening.” .

OK, my dad had given up hope. Maybe
it was a good time for me to abandon
ship, put my school spirit aside and ﬁnd
another college team to root for. And the
opportunity did present itself.,Earlier
this year, I accepted an offer to teach
high school English in Baton Rouge, La.,
through Teach for America, putting me
in the heart of Louisiana State University
territory. Sure, the Tigers are arguably
the Pitt of t-he Southeastern Conference,
but at least I could go t_o'a football game
and sit in a crowd of more than 90,000
screaming fans, watching the team com-
pete against Alabama and Auburn.

“I knew he was pretty good,” Webb
said. “But I definitely didn’t know how
good he was going to be. I don’t even
think Carvin knew how good he was
going to be.”

Nkanata, who chose to attend Pitt to
get away from his home in Fayetteville,
S.C., is quick to credit Webb in helping
him realize that potential.

“[Coach Webb and the team] have had
a huge impact on my career,” he said.
“They motivate me and they push me to
be the best, both on the track and off.
They make everything better.”

Webb, a three—time Mid—Atl‘an_tic Dis-
trict Coach of the Year, has seen that
growth in him, particularly during Nk-
anata’s senior‘ campaign.

“I’ve seen a lot of development and
growth just this past year,” Webb said.
“He’s a lot stronger and faster, but the
big thing is his flexibility. He used to not
be able to even touch his toes.”

"Now, as his collegiate career begins

to wind down and he prepares to build
on improvements from his tenure at
Pitt, Nkanata has more on his mind.
Particularly, four digits.

“2016,” Nkanata said, referring to
the upcoming Summer Olympics in Rio
DeJaneiro, Brazil. “That’s what I’ve been
working towards. It drives me to better
myself and get that result.”

Nkanata said that if he makes the
cut for the Olympic Games, he wants to
represent Kenya, his family’s homeland,
but also said that he understands the
scope of work left to put in. _

“I need to work on the little things,”
Nkanata said. “[There are] some other
technical things I need to improve on.
Basically anything that will give me the
best possible chance to make it to 2016.”

Webb has no doubt that Nkanata’s
goal can be realized.

“Absolutely I think he can get there,”
Webb said. “I think he-has the talent and

' the desire to do that, and that’s what
_ you_really need. It’s not an easy thing

to do, of course. It’s a select few. But he
has the tools to get there.” i

the broad jump (T-eighth).

“He’s one of my favorite guys who we
don’t talk about nearly enough,” Davis said
of Street. “I think in a normal draft, and
when I say normal, I mean the normal num-

- bers at each position, this guy might be a

second—round pick, but I think because wide
receivers are so stacked this year, he might
get pushed down in the dra .”

Davis sees Street going. in the lat-

er‘—to-middle rounds, and he men-- if

tioned one potential landing spot.
“Teams who are wide—receiver needy, if they
don’t get guyswho they want early, then
Devin Street could really ﬁt for them later.
I look at the Carolina Panthers, who could
probably pick four receivers in this draft

_ and not get any criticism for it,” Davis said.

So perhaps Street, a redshirt se-
nior last season, will be granted a
sixth season as a Panther, after all.
Davis liked the chances.
“I think he’d be ideal for a place like that.”

L Was I giving up? Absolutely. But there’s

no way I was the only one. Naturally, this
hopelessness was short—lived, because
Pitt always does something to keep me
coming back for more.

It was one of those games Pitt always
lost, competing against a nationally
ranked team on primetime television.

only did the game feature a Pitt fourth-
quarter comeback, but the Panthers held
on to the lead, winning for the first time
against a team I’d grown to hate over the
course of my college career. , '
