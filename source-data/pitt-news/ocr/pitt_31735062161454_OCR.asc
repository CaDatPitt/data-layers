ROTC Men
To Parade

In Stadium

The University ROTC Corpsmen
are polishing their boots and their

‘ steps for the annual review and

inspection to be held this Friday
at Pitt Stadium.

Scheduled to get underway at
2:30 p.m., the review will include
all 900 students enrolled in the Air
Force and Army ROTC corps.

First at Stadium

This will be the ﬁrst time the*

annual inspection will be held at
the Stadium, and admission to the
review is free to the public. Guests
may use only Gate 1 of the Sta-
dium. Cadets use Gate 3.

Previously the inspection was
held on the Cathedral lawn, but
it was switched this year because
of the greater space available at
the Stadium and because the lawn
is to be used by Spring Carnival.

Parade and Inspection

The program will consist of a
review of about one half hour,
followed by a detailed inspection
of each company and squadron.

During the ﬁrst portion, the Sec-
ond Army Board No. 2 will be on
the reviewing stand watching the
parade. Col. Donald McGrayne of
the Maryland Military District will
be the senior inspecting otﬁcer of
the Board.

An Air Force inspecting board
also will take part in the review.

Cadets Freed from Class

During three days this week the
University deans have allowed
ROTC cadets a few hours’ dis-
missal from afternoon classes for
practice for the inspection.

Cadets will be excused from
ROTC classes next Monday and
Tuesday to permit the making up
of any work missed during this
week dismissal from classes, ac-
cording to an announcement by

Congress./Veeds.Money,
Says Green be rger  

Student Congress wants money.

Howard Greenberger, retiring
president, cited examples Monday
in which Congress was hindered
during the last year because of
lack of funds. Such activities as
the student-faculty blennds, in-
tercollegiate conferences, the
movie program, the high school
relations clinic and Tap Day par-
ticipation suffered from the too-
small University appropriation, he
pointed out.

Need Larger Appropriation

Greenberger advocated asking
the University for a larger ap-
propriation for next year to ade-
quately cover the expense of these
and other activities. '

Other recommendations t h a t
were brought to Congress’ atten-
tion were the continuation of the
Commons Room dances, sponsor-
ing of pep rallies, the purchase of
a voting machine, typewriter and
other equipment, the furthering of
the Servicemen’s Newsletter, and
the backing of the train trips to
away football games.

Chairmen Named

After an hour-long debate,

committee chairmanships for the

the military science department.
1951-52 year were decided.

Bill McKinley won the top post
of the appointments committee
over Larry Adler and Gene Rock
after two ballots were taken.
There was no majority on the
first vote.

Adler later was named chair-
man of the publicity committee.

Two ballots were also needed to
decide the assemblies chairman-
ship which went to Sam Shapiro.

Jim Johnston was elected by
acclamation to head the social
committee.

Election Next Week

The athletic committee election
was postponed until next week
when Don Ewart or Bob Dickey
will be able to appear to speak
to Congress on the qualiﬁcations
of a representative.

President Cyril Wecht read a
letter from Fred Lange, assistant
to the director of Ellsworth Cen-
ter, which asked that present
members of the Ellsworth Center
Student Congress be used on stu-
dent projects here on the campus
next semester, since classes at the
center are being discontinued.

Teachers Worrying
Over Rumored Cuts
In Take-Home Pay

By LOXS FOIGHT
Exchange Editor

A sizable portion of Pitt’s faculty face a 20 per cent
cut in take-home pay next fall, according to an as-yet-
unconﬁrmed administration directive.

Deans of the schools have been notiﬁed of the probable
elimination of overtime teaching loads, and of a possible 10
"per cent increase in salary, depending on the state appro-
priation and the fall enrollment.

At present, salaries remain un-
changed. The University Senate,
meeting Friday to discuss the
question of a faculty pay boost,
may come to some decision on
these points.

Faculty Thought Mixed

Among the faculty, uncertainty
and disagreement over the pro-
posed plan is widespread.

Those carrying a three or more
hour overtime load, which gives
them 20 per cent more take-home
pay than the basic salary, feel the
elimination of overtime work is a
deﬁnite out. An uncertain 10 per
cent increase in basic pay next
fall would fail to make up the
difference.

Among other members of the
faculty, cutting out the overtime
work is looked upon with relief.
One department head wondered:
“Is the question a decrease in

wages or the establishmnt of a
balancd work day—8 hours?"
Overtime Needed

The policy of allowing over-
time work was put in force fol-
lowing World War II, _when both
teachers and money were scarce.
Many teachers hired since then
took their posts with the assur-
ance that they could count on
overtime gravy, and many have
come to depend on it in lieu of
cost-of-living pay raises.

Three Top Seniors

Versatile

Jane Dobroshelski,

, Geraldine Taper Braunstein and
Howard Greenberger, the three students that won the top
-honors of queen, alma mater and man of the year respective-
ly, feel that their participation in extra curricular activities
has enriched their college careers.

Students

Miss Dobrosielski summed up
the "opinions of the three by say-
ing, “My work in student govern-
ment has given me an opportunity
to know and understand people
far better than I did before.”

Both the Queen and Alma Mater
are elementary education majors

_ and plan to teach in the fall. They

are also members of Cwens. mor-
tar board and senior court.

Miss Dobrosielski was president
of her class when she was a sopho-
more, chairman of the customs
committee as a junior, and presi-
dent of WSGA in her senior year.
When asked how she felt after
being named queen she said, “I
feel very grateful, very humble,
and very happy.”

Miss Dobrosielski and Mrs.
Braunstein have worked together
closely this year on various wom-
en’s activities. After both of them
were given the honors, Mrs.

Arts Gallery Di splays

Religious Paintings

The seventh ﬂoor ﬁne arts gallery now has on display

Braunstein said, “It is a perfect
climax for our work together as a
team.”

Mrs. Braunstein has worked on
WSGA for three years. As a
sophomore she was her class rep-
resentative to WSGA, in her jun-
ior year she was corresponding
secretary, and this year she was
vice president.

The Alma Mater is married to
Maurice Braunstein a law school
student. Her spare time is taken
up by cooking, cleaning house and
typing her husband’s briefs.

Greenberger, this year’s Stu-
dent Congress president, is a mem-

to the Point Bridge.

to the present day.

Among those artists whose en-
gravings have been reproduced are
the 16th century masters, Albrecht
Durer, Lucas van Leyden, and
George Prenz.

17th Century Represented

Rembrandt van Rijn, Raphael,
Lorrain, and Redon are represen-
tative of the 17th century masters.
The contemporary works are all
original.

Exhibited also are the Ameri-
cans, Benton Spruance, Roderick
Meade, Letterio Calapai, and Jo-
seph Margulies.

The exhibit gives a strong im-
pression of the changing points of
view and differences in approach
toward religion. In the 15th and
16th centuries there was consider-
able story-telling, illustration, and
realism, with emphasis on anatom-
ical study, minute detail, and or-
derly patterns.

Artists Change Style

But in the 17th century, while
still showing minute detail and
analytical composition, artists like
Rembrandt became less illustrative
in their later works and drama-
tized space, mass, light and dark.

The 20th century, however, is an
accumulation and variation of all
points of view.

In Roua1t’s works, for instance,
one sees the compassion of Rem-
brandt and the tragedy of the early
Durer.

Many of the contemporary works
are purely abstrct and modern.
Natural forms are reduced to a
minimum.

It is also interesting to note that
the religious prints of today tend
to disprove the general feeling that
religion is not emphasized today as
it was centuries ago.

11 33-Year Career At Pitt

 

By JOANN LISOTTO
Staﬁ Reporter

When next September ar-
gives, Dr. Alfred Procter
“C ames, professor of history,
 begin his 33rd year at
Pitt.

James says that the
Vﬁost amazing change in the Uni-
iiersity since his arrival has been
i7i“lhe increase of all facilities, the
libraries, labs, ofﬁces, and con-
veniences such as the Tuck Shops
ﬁnd Faculty Club.

cw “Why 33 yars ago,” he ex-
claimed “the faculty did not even
have desks, in comparison with
‘their oiﬁces of today.”

_,Dr. James came to Pitt shortly
‘after his marriage to Mabel Wil-
jiams in 1918. From 1922 to 1925
he was the acting head of the
gziistory department.

 Father Was Clergyman
.Much of his boyhood was spent
_ ving from city to city with his
-.‘—- tinerant clergyman father. Dr.
 recalled that he was fond
 taking long camping and ﬁsh-
 trips and indulging in the
jinful pastime of smoking hand-
Fitolled cigarettes in the woods near
,,  I home.

 Dr. James laughed when ques-
Igioned conc-erning the ingredients
 his cigarettes.

,7 “Oh I made them from some
 of weed, it wasn’t tobacco,
 know.”

 speaking of his early college
 at Randolph-Macon, Dr.
,;§Jarnes tells of his great interest
*1 sports. He was top man in
ivaulting on the track team, and
 a Center he played “wild,
Jgough football”.

 Worked For Construction Co.
 Dr. James ﬁnanced most of his
education by working for a con-
-struction company as a laborer,
carpenter, and general handy-
. 0, Reminiscing over his ﬁrst teach-
 position at Castle Heights Prep
"School in Lebanon, Tennessee, Dr.
James described the school as a

v “charming, delightful old place”.

"(During his description of Castle-
heights, one could hear strong
traces of southern accent, barely
marred by his 33-year exposure to
‘ﬁe hard Pittsburgh dialect).

Dr. James smiled as he spoke
of the hazing of freshman students

This custom was enacted on the

which is still very popular in

The “Coon Hunt” took place in

sive coon, the participants cli-

.maxed the hunt with a campﬁre

in the woods.

During the hazing, the new in-
structors and students would cut
large switches and mock-fence
with each other, each attempting
to administer the sharpest whacks.
Dr. James says that in these
matches he always came out top
man.

“Of course, I used the butt end

of the stick”, he said.
Won Rhodes Scholarship

It was during his second year
at Castleheights that Dr. James
received the Virginia state’s
Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.
While living in England and
studying for his B.A. in modern
history, he traveled extensively
through Europe during vacations.

On many occasions during these
trips, he remembers being hun-
gry. Dr. James says:

“It’s a good, experience for a
human being to be hungry. Every-
one should know the feeling.”

Era ve Decision

You ready to go to war, bub? Ready to spend the next
four years in a foxhole instead of a bed? Or maybe a nice
soggy grave? -

Whether you like it or not, that question will be de-
cided for you when the decision on Gen. Dopglas MacArthur’s
plan to carry the war into Communist China is made.

It’s as simple as that, and the history books, if. there’s
anyone left to write them, will tell»you so ten years from
now.

* * * * *

Although there’s not much you can do about the de-
cision, you might like to know a little more about the factors
affecting it. And reading the Hearst papers won’t help.

/ Fortunately, Pittsburghers have a golden’ opportunity
to get the facts from the horse’s mouth tonight, when natives
of the countries affected engage in a verbal free-for-all on
today’s hottest question: Should Manchuria Be Bombed?

Sponsored by Pitt’s International Club, the question will
be kicked around by students from China, Japan, India, Eng-
land, and the United States. It will be based on grassroots
facts and homegrown opinions. It’s being held in 339 C1. at
8 p.m. We suggest you plan on staying over for it.

All Washed Up .7

Men’s Council President Roy Titéhworth will cut the last
strand of a red-tape Gordian Knot today, marking the formal
opening of the eighth ﬂoor lounge and the successful com-

pletion of Council’s battle for an. honest-to-goodness recre- '

ation spot in the Cathedral.

The tape-cutting ceremony won’t mean the end of Coun-
cil’s lounge pnoblems, however. The walls still need plas-
tered, or at least. cleaned, and there are some furnishings to
be added. . ‘

Perhaps when the visiting dignitaries see the scabby ap-
pearance the ,dirty, rough-ﬁnished walls present behind the
brand-new furniture they’ll pay some attention to Council's
plea for action. ’ -

"Dirty Politics"

For one year I became close

deals to realize that most often
the right ma__ gets elected. (I was
defeated for vice-presidency of
Men’s Cou’ncil twice.) Underneath
the high—temperature-air was
very often a sincere desire to say
something worthwhile. Action
was never ignored on any issue
when something feasible could be
worked out. _

Why, then, is the aroma, usually
connected with one of nature’s
small animals, very often applied
to student government?

The answer to that is based on
two reasons. First, theaverage

student doesn’t bother to_ no

Profs Also Want Money

ception to this widespread pre-
occupation with paychecks. They
do not fulﬁll the “up in the
clouds” appellation when it comes
to money matters. I Last February
our faculty members informed the
administration of their continu-
ing interest when they went on
record in favor of a salary boost.

At that time the administration
was caught up in the throes of a
minor wave of “hysteria.” There
was speculation that the enroll-
ment drop next fall would be so
severe that we would be out of
business, and doubts about an in-
crease in the subsidy from Har-
risburg. Now, however, this pes-
simistic attitude seems -to have
given way to a considered optim-
ism. We will be in business next
year.

Only Rumors Available

The profs, however, are still
waiting for news of their salary
increase. So far, nothing has been
forthcoming. The only informa-
tion available is of the rumor

The professorial class is no ex--

variety and it is, to say the least,
most depressing to faculty morale.

According to the rumor mill
they will get their raise. It is
supposed to amount to 10 per cent
of their base salaries. The base
salary is the amount of money
due other than that which is re-
ceived from teaching late even-
ing, Saturday and Summer classes.

Each professor has a certain
number of hours which he must
teach and for which he receives
a certain sum of money. Any
classes over this pays him extra
cash. Some professors have aver-
aged 25 per cent oftheir income
from these “overloads.”

Increase Takes Beating

Under the pay scale revision
with the 10 per cent across—the-
lectern increase, the “overload”
classes will be eliminated, thus
reducing by 15 per cent the total
salaries of many of the faculty.
The increase will be in effect a
decrease.

It ‘seems highly probable that

more than a few members of:
faculty will greet this salary A

ROTC Snubs Tradition

DAVE win

The “who-the—hell-cares”

attitude "of Pitt’s ROTC unit

towards Tap Day ceremonies last Monday is typical of the
predominant attitude here towards traditions.

Tap Day, one of the very few really colorful traditions
on campus, was ignored completely by the military. Per-

nevertheless. _
Shouts Drown Out Biddle

While Dean Biddle was present-
ing an award to the Pitt man who,
among thousands of fellow stu-
dents, has proved himself out-
standing in scholarship and leader-
ship, ROTC sergeants were shout-
ing “Fall In!” only a hundred
yards away.

While audience curiosity built
up as the two solemn white-garbed
heralds searched among the crowd
for the outstanding senior woman
who was named our Senior Queen,
cadet otﬁcers were worrying about
the third man in the second rank
who was a little out of line.

Even Alma Mater Subbed.

But most remarkable, while Tap
Day ceremonies were closing with
the singing of the Alma Mater,
the cadets were ordered to stand
“At Ease!”

Deliberate or not, these things
show an utter lack of respect for
customs and traditions that help
to keep Pitt from being a mere
“diploma factory.” '

It’s true that ten years or even
two years from now, probably
only a handful of people will re-

member the glowing words of the

haps not deliberately, but ignoredé

citations of merit that were made
in front of Heinz Chapel on a
chilly Monday back in 1951. But
Tap Day, a tradition for more than
four-score years, is not only im-

portant to those who were tapped
and those who were not.

I paid a visit to Virginia Poly-
technic Institute, a predominantly
military land-grant school, in
Blacksburg, Virginia, this past
weekend, as part of the Pitt dele-
gation to a national convention of
a college journalism fraternity.

VFI Attitude Different

The difference between th e
schools is amazing.

Friday afternoon, I watched the
black-capped ROTC cadets down
there stand retreat, while the flag
was lowered and a bugle chased
the tag ends of a sun-set from the
sky. Marching to dinner after-
wards, the cadets sounded off in
marching cadence with some of
their school cheers.

Altogether it was a colorful
ceremony, and this heightened the
peculiarity of the Pitt ROTC unit's
reaction on Monday to a.- real
school tradition. -

Chance for Tribute ,

I don’t think our cadets'sh7
have been pulled out of the
Day audience in the ﬁrst p
but once they were in format
it would have taken only a-
face and a hand salute to make
impressive tribute to ‘the Se‘
Queen. .

and they can be silly. But if"
are not completely pointless, t

If the Pitt Varsity football
team’s showing this spring is
an indication of things to
:come this Saturday, Coach
;Johnny _Chickerneo’s Old-
Timers are going to be in for .
a rough time.

Len Casanova‘s charges wal-
loped St. Bonaventure over the
weekend, 60-13. Previously they
tookgSt. Vincent into camp by
seven touchdowns in a scrimmage
session.

Nevertheless, the Old—Tim.ers,
prepping for the Spring Festival
Bowl game, started practice on
3 Monday afternoon, and also picked
up two more former Panthers.

[ Jones to Play

Latest to agree to play is one

of Pitt‘s best runners and passers
 of the last decac"e—Edgar “Special
lDelivery” Jones. Jones had been
'playing for the Cleveland Browns
gin the All-American Football
;League from 1943 to 1950.

lball with Hamilton (Ontario) of
lthe Canadian Professional Foot-
ball League.

Over the weekend George

volunteered his services. I

For assistants Chickerneo has:

‘Show Opens illbhightg

20th Century Takes Back Seat

Will the mortgage be saved?

Will John Dalton, humble son of the soil, rescue the
virtuous and timid Nellie from the clutches of the black-

hearted villain Murgatroyd?°

These are some of the problems
Pitt Players will solve tonight in
the first performance of Gold in
the Hills; or The Dead Sister’s
Secret in Foster Hall.

The show is based on a typical
nineteenth century play, and, like
most nineteenth century plays, it
will include some solemn melo-
dramatic scenes.

In one scene the prim heroine
Nellie is working as a secretary;
she is tired and discouraged. Her
employer comes up to her about
this time and tries to kiss her.

For a moment Nellie Aweakens;
then, to her horror, she smells
brandy on his breath. Says Nellie
virtuously, “Lips that touch liquor
shall never touch mine!”

In another scene John Dalton,
the homespun hero, pleads with
Nellie and declares, “Beneath this
ﬂannel shirt beats the heart of an
honest man.”

A bit of mystery is introduced
when Murgatroyd, the villain,
mutters, “I fear no man but one.”
He’s talking about Hawkshaw the
Detective who is hot on Murga-
troyd’s trail.

But the audience won‘t be able
to ﬁnd out who portrays Hawk-

shaw by looking at the program.
He’s not listed with the cast.

The answer to this little mys-
tery will be given in the last part
of the show.

It isn't all melodrama, though.
In the second act, which takes
place in Bib Mike Slattery's Bow-
ery Beer Garden, specialty acts
will dominate the scene.

Lillian Russell, Diamond Lil, and
The Four Cohens will be there
with old songs like “Sweet Marie”,
“Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage”,
and “The Degradation of a Coun-
try Girl”.

Benny Benack and his trumpet
will be featured in one of the spe-
cialty acts. Benack is also the mu-
sical director of the show.

The associate director of the
show is Theresa C. Mravintz of
the speech department, and the
assistant director is Josephine Gal-
lagher, a student at Pitt.

Since tonight is the opening
night of the play, the Players will
hold their usual reception in Fos-
ter Memorial after the show.

As is the custom, Players will
present a parody on the play at
the reception. All first nighters
are invited to attend.

Playhouse Revue Has
Top Cast, Dances, Sets

By DICK

SNYDER

Because Pittsburgh Playhouse musicals of recent years
(notably Of All Things and last year’s success, Fifty Grand)
have caused such undue excitement at the box—ofﬁice, one
of the troubles you are likely to have with On Your Mark is

getting in to see it. 4:

There are a couple of other
things likely to bother you in this

the other is the music. This is a
shame because everything alse
about On Your Mark is practically
perfect.
Dances Attractive

The dances are sprightly and
attractive; the staging, by Frank
Wagner, has a professional sheen;
Paul Trautvetter’s sets are hand-
some and imaginative; and Fred-
erick Burleigh, who is responsible

memory, ever had so much top-
drawer talent at his beck.

But, on the whole, the show is
in need of careful pruning. When
On Your Mark catches ﬁre-—-which

pleasant hit and miss revue. One
that is not going to make anyone
too unhappy, but is going to dis-
appoint those accustomed to the
high standards set by its predeces-
sors. -

The best of Bauer’s music is

Of the sketches, Putch’s “Under

at “Bitter Rice”, and Crantz’s
“Theatrical Cocktail Party” are

noisy and, for the most part, la-

Cast Excellent

But, despite the show’s frailties,
Mr. Burleigh has assembled a cast
that seems inspired. Marvin Ar-
nold, a young man who deﬁnitely
is headed for the big time, Ray
Tudor and Mr. Putch contribute
largely to On Your Mark’s win-
ning ways. And, in Lucy Seibert,
Fred Burleigh has struck a vein
of -pure sunshine. _

Everything she touches comes
alive, particularly her moments
in “Pin-Up Girls” and “When
You’re Working In A Bar.” (Mu-
sic and lyrics by Charles Gaynor.)

Too, there are sparkling assists
such charmers as Mara
Landi, Lu Beery, and Elsie Ford,
with warm nods to Marjorie Lane
and Corrine Kessler.

Dance Numbers Lively

Also on the credit side, I thought
that the dancing by William Milie

lively; that Margaret Jones and
Mr. Bauer at the Steinways were
more than adequate; and that Ray

Research Takes the long View

Fundamental studies are one
of the most important phases
of Du Pont research

Fundamental research is designed to
discover new scientiﬁc facts without
regard to speciﬁc commercialuse.Yet
from it have come many Iproducts
of commercial signiﬁcance.

At Du Pont, for_ instance, funda-
mental research has pointed the way

Where long ango and fundamental research is emphasized: the newly enlarged Du Pont Experi-

“products of tomorrow” will come
from the test tubes, ﬂasks and
stills of the research laboratory, the
Du Pont Company recently expanded
its Experimental Station near Wil-
mington. In this thirty-million-dollar
addition, major emphasis is being
given to long-range and fundamental
research.

sents one of the largest and best-
equipped research establishments in
the world. Even so, less than half of
the Company’s total research per-
sonnel is situated here. Du Pont lab-
oratories in more than 25 other loca-
tions also carry on both fundamental
and applied research.

There are now about 800 technical
people engaged exclusively in re-
search work at the Experimental
Station. Assisting them are 1,500
others, in technical and non-technical
capacities. The research people repre-
sent a wide range of training. Among
them are organic, inorganic, physical,
colloid, analytical chemists and bio-
chemists; physicists and biophysi-
cists; chemical, mechanical, metal-
lurgical, electrical and electronics
engineers; plant pathologists, plant

physiologists, agronomists, entomol-
ogists, horticulturists and others
trained in biological science. In ad-
dition, there are specialists who
are not classiﬁed in any of these
groups.

Free for Research

At the Du Pont Experimental Sta-
tion every effort is made to permit
the research man to concentrate on
research. He is provided with the
most modern laboratory tools and for
the construction of specialequipment
he can call on a wide variety of serv-
ices. These include machine shops,
carpentry, electrical, welding, instru-
ment—making, and glass-blowing
shops. When the research worker
needs any service or equipment with-
in the scope of these shops, it is pro-
vided for him.

At this industrial research labora-
tory, Du Pont scientists are devoting
themselves to extending the fron-
tiers of science and creating “Better
Things for Better Living . . . through
Chemistry.”
