Students will soon be able to shop
around and register for classes online
underanewsystemthatPittwill imple-
ment for spring term enrollment.

SamConte,theuniversity registrar,
said the newsystemis straightforward.
After students meetvviththeiradvisers,
they can scan through class catalogs
and, when they ﬁnd some they like,

The Student Services tab under
my.pitt.edu teaches students how to
use this system. Ifstudents click on
the “Clickheretoleamhowtouse Self
Service Enrollment” directlyunderthe
redheading, the site connects themto

apageﬁlledwithvideos andPDFs that _

describe every step of the enrollment
process.

But before students can register,
they must meet with their advisers,
Conte said. At the meetings, advisers
suggest classes and discuss degree
progress. Advisers do not have to ap
prove any classes. ‘

Ifstudents neglecttovisit advisers,
a hold will remain on their accounts.
After students meet with their advis-
ers, however, the advisers will enter
commands into the computerthatwill
allow students to register online.

Frank Beatrous Jr., professor and
undergraduate director of the math-
ematics department, said thatstudents

have more responsibility under this
new system. Advisers will .have less
control over what students do and
what classes they pick. Advisers will
also limit their involvement to only
recommending classes. ‘

Students can start the enrollment
process onthe date oftheir enrollment
appointment, which they can ﬁnd by
going to the Student Center and click-
ing on Self Service. Once there, stu-
dents can click on the Student Center
tab and look under the Enrollment
Date heading.

V Enrollment appointments were
assigned to students based on the
number of credits they’ve completed.
Anyone who did not receive an enroll-
ment appointment, such as transfer
students or newly accepted students,
can only register after Nov. 11, during
the open enrollment period.

Once students’ enrollment appoint-
ments begin, they have until the ﬁnal
day of the add/drop period of spring
to change their schedules.

A student cannot add anything
prior to the time of their appoint-
ment, but it is a good idea to preview
class offerings, times and availability
in the catalog, just like in the previous

system.

Professor named editor in chief of music program

Niki Walters
Staﬁ Writer

Pitt professor Deane Root “couldn’t
believe it” when he found out he
would become editor in chief of one
of the world’s largest collections of
music reference works.

    

Sean Coyne I FOR THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS

“It’s the world standard for what’s
important in our ﬁeld,” he said of the
Oxford University Press’ Grove Music
Program, which he’s now editing.

The Grove Music Program, which
has both print and online versions,

provides reference material about
music. Based on a classic Victorian
work called “The Dictionary of Mu-
sic and Musicians,” the Grove Music
Program contains more than 60,000
articles that range from short artist
biographies to long articles on coun-
tries and famous composers.

It also prints books like “The New
Grove Dictionary of Musical Instru-
ments” and “The New Grove Diction-
ary of American Music,” which it’s
currently updating.

As editor in chief, Root will help
decide the new subject areas that
the publications should include,
supervise revisions and updates
and recommend scholars to serve
as reviewers or editors for Grove’s
projects.

Amber Fischer, senior editor
of Grove Music and Oxford Mu-
sic Online, said Oxford University
Press selected Root for the position
because the company was looking
for someone who was active in the
academic ﬁeld.

“He sort of covers all of the differ-
ent bases and people we are trying
to serve — librarians, students and
scholars,” Fischer said.

Fischer said Root came highly
recommended by an advisory panel
of music scholars representing dif-

of music reference. Ever since that
time, on several occasions when
there have been major projects that

ferent associations and societies in
musicology and music theory. The
press contacted the president of
the American-Musicological Soci-

’ ety,‘ among other organizations, for

recommendations.

Root, who has experience in mu-
sic editingand librarianship, has been
working with Grove for years.

“I kind of grew up working with
Grove, because when I was in grad
school, one of my ﬁrst jobswas to
work with Grove,” Root said. “It was
a great experience. It was like four
years of education packed into two
— a lot of work, a lot of learning,
and it trained me in the business

"(  \

Grove is doing, I have been asked to
be a part of it.”

Root works largely from his of-
ﬁce in Pittsburgh, where he hopes
to continue to teach.

“I get a lot from the relationship
with the students, from what they
bring into the classroom,” he said. “I
really enjoy the students. They have
a lot of energy and creativity, and
their experiences and their knowl-
edge inform me.” ‘

Fischer said that was one of the
qualities that motivated Oxford Uni-
versity Press to choose Root.

“One of the main beneﬁts of con-
tinuingto teach is remaining in touch

with the scholarly world, being afﬁli-

ated with a university and in touch

with the students,” Fischer said.
Root’s students say he’s not the

stereotypical professor.

He uses Billboard Top 100 songs,
from artists like Beyoncé and Taylor
Swift, to teach his classes.

“Professor Root really knows

‘what he’s talking about, and it’s ob-

vious that he has a lot of experience,”

A Michael Pollock, a Pitt senior major-

ing in business and music, said.

Root said he prefers to listen to
opera and orchestral music, as well
as some country music when he is
driving, but that there is no music in
particular that he does not like.

“There’s nothing that I can’t
stand. I’m fascinated by all kinds of
music,” Root said. “In terms of dif-
ferent styles and different genres, I
like to hear it all.” .

He also said that he remembers
being drawn to music from a very
early age and became more so in
later years. i

“Making music around the piano
at home and that kind of stuff, I’ve
done a lot of that in my lifetime,”
Root said

Pitt student Tracey Hickey was arrested for

She said she’d been holding the door to Towers

Instead of housing immigrants
in jails surrounded by razor wire,
the government would shelter
them in “detention centers” likely
surrounded by barbed wire.

Currently, Immigrations and

processing, either for asylum or

tain about 380,000 people per
year, according to The New York
Times.

Putting non—violent immi-
grants, including children, in the
clink poses hazards for both the
prisoner and prison. Over~crowd-
ing already bloats penitentiary
costs while decreasing security.
Relocating these immigrants to
less threatening facilities makes
them safer, and it allows prison

guards t0 concentrate on more ’

dangerous inmates.

Plus, it would save a lot of
money. '

Xenophobes and T.E.A. party-
goers will surely protest the spend-
ing of taxpayer money on illegal
immigrants -— though not every
detained‘ immigrantiis a border-
hopper, as some are jailed for even
minor infractions, like expired vi-
sas._Yet, government funds pay ex-

orbitant rates to keep immigrants
in jails and private prisons.
Placing them in the proposed
centers would reduce the cost from
about $100 per person per day to
$14, according to The New York
Times. That just makes sense.
Also, merely renovating these
hotels and homes improves infra-
structure while creating a few jobs,
however temporary. Construction
workers will update residences,
which will require at least. some
‘ guards and administrators to

maintain. Yes, this will increase I

the number of bureaucrats, but it
will also simplify the transporta-
tion and detention of people who
do not warrant prison cells.

For anyone who complains that
these so—called criminals will be
living the good life in a lower-
security detention center, know
that this ain’t the Ritz. The Times
documented a facility similar to
those proposed by Homeland Se-
curity that will house 700 people
and is encircled by barbed wire.
Homeland Security Secretary Ja-
net, Napolitano said that the gov-

ernment will continue detaining

felons in jails.

The point is to remove non—vi-
olent people from potentially vio-
lent situations while saving some
much-needed cash. I

One concern does arise, how-
ever. In the attempt to conserve
money, these facilities could be-

come squalid de facto jails. After ‘

their creation, the centers will
be easy political targets for ﬁscal
hawks looking to cut budget ap-
propriations.

If the federal government is se-
rious about creating a “truly civil
detention system,” as Assistant

Secretary of Immigration and Cus- '

toms Enforcement John Morton
claims, it needs to commit to main-
taining healthy, non-threatening
_ quarters for immigrants.

Many detaineesjust want to live
in the United States. They deserve a
safe environment while the govern-
fnent tells them they can’t.

Old Kissinger taught new tricks

In a Heinz Hall Q£‘9’A, Kissinger discusses political realism, global warming

 
  
 

Mason Herron
Columnist

Heinz Hall was not ﬁlled with the

familiar melodies of the Pittsburgh V

Symphony Orchestra on Monday. In-

stead, two chairs positioned around

a coffee table accommodated a cozy

discussion on stage in the grand au-

ditorium. Paul O’Neill, U.S. treasury
secretary from 2001-02, occupied

the chair on the right. In the chair on

the left sat Henry Kissinger, former
national security advisor, secretary

of state under Presidents Nixon and

Ford, foreign policy guru and one of
the most captivating individuals of
the 20th century.

Kissinger ﬁelded questions from

O’Neill and the audience. He dis-‘

cussed the current economic crisis,

China, energy, nuclear proliferation,

the G-20 Summit, negotiating, the
Middle East, the Cuban embargo

and the Israeli—Palestinian conflict.

Onthis particular evening, Kissinger
vibrantly displayed his knowledge of
world affairs.

’ Although Nixon’s downfall has
placed him among history’s most

disappointing presidents, his for-
eign policy was relatively SLlCC€SSﬁ.il
and progressive. Nixon’s accomplish-
ments included ending American
involvement in the Vietnam War,
opening up diplomatic relations with
China and implementing the policy

66

Kissinger clearly
understands this is a
different world.

ofdétente with the Soviet Union. Al-
ways loomingwithin the background
was Kissinger —- negotiating with
foreign leaders and pulling the cor-
rect diplomatic levers. Kissinger
was even awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize “for the 1973 Paris agreement
intended to bring about a cease-ﬁre
in the Vietnam War and a withdrawal
of the American forces,” according
to NobelPrize.org.

Kissinger, throughout most of his
career, was known as a proponent

. of Realpolitik, or less pejoratively,

political realism. In his view, nations

acted not in the interest of a greater
moral good nor in consideration of
the international community, but
instead behaved in ways that would

best enhance that particular na-

tion’s relative economic and military
power.

Yet, Monday evening Kissinger
revealed that he had begun to retreat
from the theory that had inﬂuenced
the decisions he made while working
for the State Department. He had
come to terms with a world vastly
different from the one that he had
meticulously studied. The global
economy, from Kissinger’s perspec-
tive, had become a dominating force
behind international relations.

As he spoke of the recent global
ﬁnancial crisis, Kissinger said, “The
economic organization of the world
was out of whack with the political
organization of the world.” While
economics has become international,
politics still remain national. Politics
being what they are, the political in-
terests subvert economic interests.

Kissinger: Cold War no tea party

Herron 44 5

Kissinger also elaborated on another issue

that the world must face in unity: global warm— ,

ing. The problem with coordinating efforts to
ﬁght global warming, Kissinger said, is that “in
almost every country, the political leaders are
driven by relatively short—term considerations.”
Global warming is along—term problem. World
leaders must deal with the problem while dodg-
ing short—term electoral consequences. It’s this
conflict that has been the primary bulwark

against efforts to curb global warming.

Kissinger, 86, clearly understands this is
a different world than that of the ’70s. He has
come to accept that globalization has radi-
cally altered the way we understand what a
nation’s interest is and that what might be
in one nation’s interest might not be directly
opposed to the well-being of another. The
economic crisis revealed that there is a new
interdependence among nations. The result,
as Kissinger described it, is that everyone still
wants to be more independent but has to stay

close together.

At the end of the evening, O’Neill pointed‘
out that it’s difficult to ﬁnd an individual who
hasbeen as inﬂuential within U.S. govern-
ment in the past 50 years as Henry Kissinger.
I struggle to disagree.

During Kissinger’s analysis of the Cold War,
he reminded the audience that it was not a “tea
party” and that communism was a great fear
and obsession of the United States. After com-
munism’s collapse, those fears were alleviated
and the doors appeared to open for a hopeful
and promising ﬁiture among nations. We no

longer face the obsession with communism we '
- once did, so our ability to develop and imple-

ment new ideas has ﬂourished. - e

As the sun sets on Kissinger’s era, he still
believes that, even with the obstacles we face
today, “We live in a period of great opportunity,
so, in that respect, I am optimistic.”

Did you know that Ella Fitzgerald

’ sang the “Reading Rainbow” theme

song?

Well, not the Fitzgerald you’re
thinking of, but Tina Fabrique, the
actress who plays the soulﬁil singer
in the traveling tour of “Ella.”

The show, now running at the
O’Reilly Theater, showcases the ca-
reer of Fitzgerald.

Set in a 1966 rehearsal and
concert in Nice, France, Fitzgerald
struggles to come to grips with the

death of her half—sister Francis. Her

manager, Norman Granz (Harold
Dixon), believes she’s better offwork—
ing than moping. So, that’s exactly
what she does. '

“Each song has been chosen to

, move the story line ahead,” Fabrique

said. “She addresses the audience like

_ they are one person that she can talk

to, like a really dear old friend. Then,

she begins to go back and reminisce

about how she got to where she is.”
Fabrique, who was chosen for

the role years ago while working
on a show in Connecticut, had to do
extensive research on Fitzgerald to
prepare.

“No one knew about her person-
ally,” she said. “They knew about her
as a wonderful singer, so I had to re-
search to ﬁnd that stuff out. I read a
biography on her and continued to

actively study her. I got a DVD called .

‘Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live
For.’ Gene Davis, who passed away
about two years ago, did abiography

- on Ella that always plays on A&E.”

‘ There are 23 songs performed in
“Ella,” so embodying the jazz queen
is no easy task for Fabrique.

“I’m involved in her persona and
how she feels about music. She was
very shy but very courageous musi-

cally, so I have to do certain things '

so that I can be just as courageous,”
Fabrique said.

“I take very good care of my voice
and body. I do seven shows a week,
so I live like a monk. I don’t socialize
a lot. I sleep in late. I eat really well
—- no junk food.”

While Fabrique has had extensive
experience in a wide variety of music

genres, it was her natural inclination A

toward jazz that got her the part.
“They said to me, ‘You’re a good
actress, a good singer, and you have
the look. If you can scat, you’ve got
the job,”’ Fabrique said. “And that’s

how it happened.”

Fabrique started singing when
she was just 3 years old. V

_“My mom would take me to birth-
day parties and say, ‘Oh put Tina up
there and let her sing ‘Happy Birth-
day.”’

But she struggled with accepting
it as her career for a long time.

“I knew I wanted to sing and be
on stage, but my father wasn’t very
supportive of that. He was Caribbean
and felt that just because you could
sing and dance didn’t mean you could
earn a living,” Fabrique said.

, “He said I needed to go to school
so I could put a roof over my head.
But music always seemed to ﬁnd .me.
I always got called upon to do some
kind of entertainment work, so I ﬁ-

nally realized —— this is what I was

going to do.”

While she never went to school
for formal training, award—winning
Fabrique has performed on Broad-
way, episodes of “Law& Order,” and,
yes, sang the theme song for the be-
loved “Reading Rainbow.”

Fabrique said this show is a great
opportunity to gain insight about
Fitzgerald as a person.

“I think people are going to be
surprised to ﬁnd out that Ella Fitzger-
ald was not originally going to be a
singer. She started as a dancer to
make money, because she came from

a very humbled youth.”

Fitzgerald was unique in her will
of character. She was one of few jazz
singers considered to live a very
stra'ight—edged life.

. “She sold a lot of records without
taking that bad rap that a lot of jazz
singers do — they drink, do drugs,
are publicly unhappy —— but she
didn’t have any of that,” Fabrique
said. “She lost her mother at a very

young age, she lived on the street, .

she was put in an orphanage, she was

beaten by male staff. There were a ’

lot of sad things in her life, but she
never turned to those bad things.
She put them behind her and moved
forward. I

“As a voice of American pop
music, she was considered the very
best,” Fabrique said. “But, because
no one knew about her life, this show
is like opening up abrand new page.
She was very courageous.”

Actress and singer Tina Fabrique belts it out just like her character,

the infamous Ella Fitzgerald.

The Internet has a huge inﬂuence
on the music industry right now.Just.
ask Lars Ulrich.

Since the emergence of Napster,
we, the people, have been swimmingin
a sea ofwondrously free music, while
record label execs pull their hair out
trying to stop the ﬂow of free music.

There is a lot of media attention
on how the Internet is rocking the
foundation of the industry and how
musicians and record labels are shak-

. ingintheirbootsoverthethreatposed
, by the big, bad Internet.

But downloading aside, I think
people tend to forget how absolutely
amazing and beneﬁcial the Internet
is for artists and fans alike. Corpo-
rate America might take a ﬁnancially
minded stance, but since when have
music lovers and liberal college stu-
dents been concerned with what men
in suits have to say? 4

The Internet, and the technology
that comes with it, doesn’t just open

a door to an endless source of new '

music but rather takes a bulldozer to
a retaining wall.

The Internet inﬁnitely expands
bands’ and artists’ audiences and gives
them free publicity and a great way
to get their name out. Anyone with a

computer can StumbleUpon, Google
or MySpace any band he pleases and
stream its music legally.

Thousands of music blogs circulate
music news and buzz about artists,
while You'I‘ube features musicvideos.
Plenty of other resources, including
eventhe outdated MySpace,putbands’
music and names out on the Web.

As lame as it might be, you can’t
deny that MySpace’s last surviving
function, other than as a great re-
source for sexual predators, is music.
Some bands evenuse itastheirprima—
rybandwebsite these days because it’s
a great way to introduce fans and po-
tentialfans to aband’s music with free
streaming, photos and band bios.

One ofthebestiesources for music
fans on the prowl is probably popular
Internet radio sites, like Pandora and
Last.fm. _

For the past year, I’ve been involved
in a love affair with Pandora. In the
hour it took me to write this column,
it has given me two bands that I loved
atﬁrstlisten— Stars and Badly Drawn
Boys. It just knows me so well! Even
my mom discovered the wonders of
Pandora in the form of the ABBA sta-
tion.

But it’s not the lovely Web design

‘ orthewell-organizedlayoutthatrnake

me adore Pandora, though these do
give it a leg up over Last.fm in my
opinion. It’s the fact that I can type in

Internet can be legal musical tool 

what I’rn in the mood for and receive
not only what I ask for, but more —- '
and everything is freely available on
any computer with speakers and an
Internet connection.

It gives tons of small-name bands
free publicity and gives me, the lis-
tener, the giddy excitement of ﬁnd- ..
'inga new band to gush over for a few
weeks.

So yeah, illegal downloading is
rough on the music industry, but it’s
certainly not the nail in the cofﬁn by
any means. L

There is alot of good comingﬁom 
the Internet, and the industry needs
to adjust and ﬁnd more ways to make
it work for them.

If Morie Kephart had her way, she
would have shared the records and
awards she’s accumulated with her
teammates.

The junior goalkeeper said she
couldn’t have broken Pitt’s records

"for season shutouts (6) and career 0

shutouts (11) without the help of her
defense.

“They are making my job really
easy,” Kephart said. “They make me

V ‘ look good. I demand alot out ofthem,

and they demand alot out of me. Ithink

the awards shouldbe givento thewhole -

defense.” .

Along with breaking two records,
Kephartwas selected as one of College
Soccer 360’s Primetime Players of the
Week forthe week of Sept. 14. Shewas
also named a member of the Big East
Honor Roll the same week. '

Kephart leads the Big East with a

.910 save percentage and is second in

saves per game with 5.55. She has 61,
total saves this season.

While Kephart said the acknowl-
edgements are important to her be-
cause of how hard she’s worked, she
was quick to move the spotlightto her
defense.

She said shejoins wit;hthe backﬁeld
of Kat Weiler, Maura Caslin, Rebecca
Fraser and Abbigail Baldys to form a
highly elﬁcient unit.

, “I give all the credit to them,”
Kephart said. “I’d rather see the team
succeed than have my own name in
the paper.”

Pitt head coach Sue—Moy Chinpre-
dicted Kephart would heap much of the
praise onto her teammates but added
that Kephart has played remarkably
for the team all season.

She said Kephart’s ability to read
the game and her shot—stopping skills
are two of her biggest strengths,
strengths that have allowed herto keep
the Panthers’ goal virtually untouched
this season.

“She’s come up big for us, making

thesavesshehastomakeandmaking
bigsaves inordertokeepus inthe game
and keep her shutouts,” Chin said.

Accordingto Chin, Kephart notice-
ably improvedthis season, which Chin
attributes to aconcentration onﬁmess
and an increase in conﬁdence.

“She’s really focused, and she set
goals forherselfthis season,” Chin said.
“She wanted to. break those records
and get shutouts. She wanted to get at

66%-

I’d rather see the team
succeed than have my
own name in the paper.

Marie Kephart

least 10 shutouts this year.”
Kephart said she spent her entire
summer in Oakland working out and

attempting to get in the best shape
possible so she could compete at her
highest level.

. Chin said that. kind of focus is
Kephart’s biggest strength.

“When she got here, she played on
the ﬁeld a little bit as well as playing in
goal,” Chin said. “Now, she’s focused on
only being a goalkeeper and that has
really helped. That focus on her part

i- and improved ﬁtness are the reasons

‘she’s progressed so well.”
Kephart’s competitive focus comes

from arriving at the University as an ,

under-recruited underdog. Injured in
high school, Kephart was mostly un-
aware of how the recruiting process
worked. -
She contacted Chin and expressed
interest in coming to Pitt. In March of
Kephart’s senior year in high school,
Chin offered her a spot on the roster.
“I’ve kind ofhadachip on my shoul-
der eversincel got here,” Kephart said.
“I’ve just been working hard to prove
myself. Everythingl do is never re-
ally good enough for me, so I just keep

pushing myself?’
Somewhere along the line, the
under-recruited high school player

became a record-setting goalkeeper;

and what Chin described as a very
emotional leader.

“She likes to get pumped up and to
get the girls pumped up,” Chin said.

However, the humble Kephart
doesn’t want to keep the leadership
credit all to herself. She said the team
is ﬁlled with leaders, which is one of
the reasons the Panther squad is 6-2-4
this season. A

“We have a lot of people who have
been stepping up,” Kephart said. “I’ve
been trying to do my part. I see the
whole entire ﬁeld from my angle, so
if I can be a leader and help that way,
then thafs what I want to do.”

“Kephart uses hervocal leadership
to organize the players infrontofher,”
Chin said.

“She loves to compete, she hates to
lose, and with that comes great work
ethic,” Chin said. “She deﬁnitely carries
that with her in games.”

This was it: the Elite Eight of March
Madness. Finally, the Panthers were
shattering critics’ banter about Pitt’s

‘inabilitytomakeadeeprunintothe

NCAA Tournament. ,

But on March 28, the Villanova
Wildcats defeatedthe No. 1—seededPan—
thers, 78-76, intheﬁnalseconds ofthe
game. This heart-wrenchinglosstoBig
Eastfoe Villanova endedthe2008-09
season for Coachjamie Dixon’s Pan-
thers — who went 31-5 in the regular
season and suffered only three losses
in conference play. The Panthers were
undefeated at home last season.

No doubt about it, expectations for
last season were at an all-time high.
With superstars like Dejuan Blair, Sam
Young and Levance Fields now in the
NBA, fans hope that newveteran play-
ersandfreshmenalikewillmakeahuge

“We’realittleyoungerthanwe have ,

been,” Dixon said. “But you’re only as
experiencedas you behave. I have seen
freshmen act like seniors and seniors
act likefreshmen.”

The Pitt mens basketball team has
sold out 125 consecutive games. They

have currently won 20 games or more
in eight consecutive seasons.

Four freshmen look to make sig-
niﬁcant contributions to this Panthers’
season. Dante Taylor, Talib Zanna,j.].
Richardson and Lamar Patterson will
be the highlight of Dixon’s recruiting
class this year, whichranks amongthe
top-25 inthe nation. N

Taylor, a 6-foot-9 forward, is Pitt’s
ﬁrst McDonald’s All-American recruit

' since the late-1980s. He is a deﬁnite
contenderto replace Blair, who turned '

pro followinghis sophomore season.
Taylor chose Pitt over fellow Big
East competitors, Connecticut andVil-
lanova, and long—time basketball pow-
erhouses Florida, Maryland, Kansas
and Memphis. -
Zanna, another 6-foott-9 power
forward from Maryland, came to the
United States from Nigeria four years
ago to pursue a career in basketball.

In 2003, Rush Limbaugh worked for ESPN as a
commentator on the network’s NFL pregame
show, “Sunday NFL Countdown.” On air in Sep-
tember that year, Limbaugh said that Eagles
quarterback Donovan McNabb was overrated
because the media wanted to see a black quar-
terback succeed.

The comments were widely regarded as of-
fensive and racist. Limbaugh resignedfromESPN

‘ three days after making the comments.

Now this man wants to buyan NFL fran-
chise.
Reports ﬂuttered this past Tuesday that Lirn—

baugh, with St. Louis Blues owner Dave Checketts g

and other urmamed partners, made a bid to buy
the St. LouisRarns — afranchisewithanestimated
worth of $929 million. ‘ .

In the NFL, 67 percent of the league is black.
The head of the NFLPA, DeMaurice Smith,‘is also
black. It is undeniable that numerous other non-
black players in the league probably don’t agree
with Limbaugh’s extreme conservative politics.

So, ifyouwere inthe NFLand Lirnbaughwant—
ed to buy your team, would you play for him?

The NFL is abusiness andfootball is aplayer’s
occupation. It wouldn’tbe theﬁrsttime inhistory
thatan employee philosophically differs fromhis

     
    

lifAli oayszo

re ﬂak for Limbaugh

employer: Realistically, most players do not want
to bite the hand that feeds them, the hand that
pens their salary checks.

But this is also Rush Limbaugh. The afore-
mentioned McNabb comments are just the tip
of the iceberg. This is a guy who called President
Barack Obama the “magic n"gro” in an LATirnes
interview in 2007.

Duringthe2008 presidentialprimaries, Lirn—
baugh implored his Republican radio listeners to
register as Democrats simply to vote for anyone
other than Obama and sabotage his campaign.
The scarythingisthatanestimated16,00o people
actually did it.

I think it’s safe to assume that the majority of
NFLplayers probably don’t agree with Limbaugh.
But, would anyone be willingto mail in their pay-
checktotakeastandagainstthe rightwingpundit?
Would you? H

Inaninstance where pne’s livelihood would be
at risk, the potential well—being and support for
one’s family would be in question and one’s very
existence jeopardized, could an athlete’s moral
compass direct him on the side of ethics and not
dollar bills?

Limbaugh is far more vocal and well-known
than most current NFL owners. But no Aﬁican—
Americanhaseverheldamajority ownership ofan
NFLteam.All0wners aremulti-millionaires —at
least— andallarewhite. Some mightholdsimilar

conservative views as Limbaugh. I’d bet a few of j

them are even friends with the guy.

Perhaps much ofthe league alreadyplays fora
guy muchlike Limbaugh. For allwe know, players
arealreadymakingthe conscious decisionto swal-
low their ideologies in exchange for a salary.

. We’ve seen athletes give up money in favor of
political beliefs before. Muhammad Ali missed
much ofhis prime in reﬁisingto ﬁghtinthe Viet-
namwar. PatTillmangaveupacareerintheNFL
to enlist and ﬁght overseas.

' But ultimately, the question is “do the play-
ers care?” Is it even relevant what they think? Is
there room for ideology —— whether it be racial '
or political — in sports?

Everythingis debatable. With Limbaugh, you
never know. The manlashions hirnselfas much
an entertainer as he does a politico. Maybe his
extreme ideas and claims are an exaggeration of
What he actually thinks — or maybe he really is

just a jack*ss.

Idon’tl<;now Butldo knowthatthemanwants
to buy an NFL franchise. If confronted with the
situation, Iwould like to believe McNabb wouldn’t

The fact is, Iﬁndithardtobelieve that anyone
would, actually protest Limbaugh. Maybe some
players don’t even know who he is or know the
politics of their current bosses.
