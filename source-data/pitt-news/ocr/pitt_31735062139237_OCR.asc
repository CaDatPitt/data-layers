The smoke investigation now be-

chairman, is not devoid of its humor-

their smoke abatement appliances.
VVhen such devices are received and
tested, it happens frequently that no-
body knows how to operate the
mechanism, not even the inventors
themselves, or that the original cost
of the device is. greater than the an-

Many Democrats ofithe University
of Pittsburgh among the IIIIdergI'ad—
uates and alumni are organizing a
Wilson Club to further the candidacy
of Gov. Wood1‘ow \/Vilson for Presi-
dent of the United States.‘

A mass meeting will be held Fri-
day morning on the steps of Thaw
Hall after chapel, at which some pr~orn-
inent Democrats of national reputa-
tion will make an address. It is

probable that ex-Mayor George W:

Guthrie, who is an alumnus of Pitt,
will be there. A band will furnish
music.

After the meeting the club will be
organized and a vigorous and syste-
matic campaign started to boost-Gov.
VVilson for the Democratic nomina-
tion. . Handbills and posters will be
displayed in all departments urging
all “true” Democrats to avail them-
selves of the opportunity to get in
the Democratic band wagon, which
is the only true way to a national

victory,‘ according to VVilson sup-
porters.‘
The boasts of the VVilson men

have aroused the old *‘-“dyed-_in—the-

Roosevelt men and Taft followers

are already making arrangements for

boosting their favolrites. Clubs sup-

ADDRESSES STUDENTS
Details History of Observatory and
‘the Men Who
‘Made It.

HIS CANDIDACY ENDORSED

Dr. John A. Brashear on VVednes-
day morning gave one of his charac-
teristic talks to the students and fac-
ulty of the University of Pittsburgh.

if The speaker gave many interesting
details of the early history of the Uni-
versity and referredto the hardships
experienced by the pioneers in the de-

' velopment of the Allegheny Observa-

tory; and the worthy scientiﬁc facts
they accomplished with ﬂheirlimited
equipment.

Concerning Professor Langley, the
great scientist who contributed much

"to our present knowledge of the laws

of aviation, Dr. Brashear stated: “He
‘careful
worker and would go over his experi-
ments hundreds of times -before ac-

was a very persistent and

ycepting the results as final, German

scientists on examining his work

found practically no mistakes in it.

“The desire of Prof. Langley’s life
was to invent a ﬂying machine. He
worked very hard to build a substan-
tial airship and capture the $50,000
Offered‘-by President McKinley during
the Spanish—American war for such
an invention.”

Dr. Brasihear then told his audience

Vhow Langley had built a model and

when trying it a small part of the ma-
chine had broken, causing it to fall
after ﬂying only a short distance.

Langley’s death was due -to the way
the public press ridiculed his efforts
in building this air ship. He "W215"
humbled" and greatly grieved by news-
paper accounts given him by are-
porter who had spent some time
at the observatory» and
whom he had discharged for ineffi-
ciency.” , '

Dr. Brashear referred to the Prince-
ton banquet and said Princeton was
not the only institution in the Uni_ted
States. Neither is the University of
Pittsburgh,” he cautioned.

As he proceeded to tell the stu-
dents that “all schools and universi-

ties must’ drop the selﬁsh opinions.

they hold, since all are needed i11 the
great work they accomplish.

“I. feel like kicking myself for ac-
cepting the candidacy as a delegate to
the National Republican convention.
I think the Lord will look over this
one pun in my life,” said Dr. Bra-
shear in referring to his candidacy.

At the conclusion of the address
Cheer—leader

That this proposal met with the
hearty approval of the students was
demonstrated by a spirited response.

Mr. Kirk also proposed that Dr.
Brashear’s candidacy for National Re-

publican convention delegate be en-

dorsed and the vote of the audience
was unanimous in his favor. \

IMPORTANT QUES-
TIONS DISCUSSED

 

(Continued from Page 1)
There was much discussion con-
cerning the progress being made in
the gathering of subscriptions for the
new student building. It was gener-
ally conceded by all present that the
building fund was not going forward
as rapidly as it should. Many new
plans were suggested and many
amendments to the present plan were
presented, but none was found to ex-
actly fit the situation,and the matter
was left unsettled.

Chancellor .\lcCormick presented
the problem of a better system of ii-
nances for the student publications.
He pointed out the fact_.tliat when
these publications contracted debts

that they were unable to pay it re-
flected on the University. .The Chan— A

cellor suggested the incorporation of
these publications. However, no de_f—

initeplaii was adopted for bettering:

the present situation.
Considerable. time was given to the

_ question of chapel atteiidaiice. Chapel

attendance on Mondays, and Fridays
was admitted to be very poor indeed,

'wliile even the weekly convocation

was claimed to be not up to the
standard it should. Various plans for
chapel attendance in use by other
schools were given thorough consid-
The ii1atterw.as finally left
in the hands of the various deans and
they were instructed to see that more
students turned out to chapel exer-
cises.

The return to a two seniester.plan
instead of the present four—term sys-

.tem was advocated by some of the

members of the faculty, but, after
much discussion, the matter was left
unsettled.

i.TlllS meeting of the faculty was
one of the most important held for
some time One liundre_d members

THE PITT WEEKLY

THE RELATION OF ACOLLEGE

HALL TO DEMOCRACY

In delivering the Phi Kappa ad-
dress at Hobart College, -Dr. Charles
Downer Hazen said: “There is an-

other aspect of college life which
,must never be allowed to disappear,

so important is it to the nation, its
spirit ofgdemocracy,” There is a dan-
ger, a growing danger, which is more
than noticeable in our country of an
intellectual aristocracy, which has
tended to ally itself with wealth and
corruption. This is, in a few instances,
due to the teaching but in most cases
to an atmosphere in college life cre-
ated by the students and student or-

ganizations. Some college men have

held themselves, because of their ed-

ucational opportunities, as men apart
from the rest of mankind, and. the or-

,ganizations of their making only go-

\/Vith the ‘in-

crease of questions demanding solu-

to emphasize this idea.

tioiis to be found only in democratic

principles, and with the increase in

numbers of college students the‘ prob— ,

lein becomes more acute.

Various remedies have been sug-

gested to meet this condition. In

some cases the whole system of uni-
versity life has been II1OCllllCd. There

seems, however, to be one general so-
lutioii, a student hall. Here men of
all departinents———graduate student and
ui.idergraduate—rich and poor, fra-
ternity and non—fraternity, of all na-
tionalities, of all creeds and of all po-
litical beliefs meet on a common
ground. Here they meet for common
purposes, and they cannot help but
come to know that while one man
may be better than another that it
cannot be in birtlior wealth, but in
solid work to society. '

VVe think of a student hall as the
center of student life and thought.
Here they meet and here they think,
not in narrow scholastic ﬁelds, but of
the relation of the student to the uni-
versity and the university to the city,
state or nation. It is here they learn
to put into‘ practice democratic ideas
and ideals. VVe cannot but think that
the Harvard students who crowded
into Harvard Union to hear Theodore.
Roosevelt, went away with the feel-
ing that it was the duty of each and
every one of them to contribute as
lla1‘vard men to the solution of 1121-
tional problems. No university in this

—broad land can escape making its con-

tribution to the creed of faith in men
and in the rectitude of their impulses.

\‘/Ve need such a student hall at the
University of. Pittsburgh. A place
first where the students can meet as
Pitt men without regard to organiza-
tion or fraternity, a place where Pitt
men can discuss problems of univerr
sity life, a place where they can see
and hear the men who are the makers
of present day thought, a place where
they can learn the duty of making

their contribution to the ultimate tri- .

umph of democracy.

BRYSON WILL AGAIN _
LEAD TRACK TEAM
At a meeting of the letter men in
State Hall last VVednesday, Oscar H.
Bryson was unanimously elected cap-
tain of the 1912 -track team. Bryson
successfully led the team of the pre-
vious year and his re-election shows
the appreciation and kindly feeling

- which the other members of the teain

feel towards him.

An election was necessary due to
the fact that Homer E. Halferty Who-
was elected captain last summer at
the close of the season was forced
to resign owing to deﬁciencyin his
studies caused by illness.

Bryson’s election was sanctioned by

Opsi-on graduated from Pittsburgh

of Engineering the following term.

He has had good experience in man-
aging the track and football teams of
the Red and Black institution, and
will be a great help to Manager Hall
in handling -track «affairs. He earned
his letter at P. H. S. in the two-mile
run and is working at,Trees Stadium
daily with the other candidates.

With two such men in line for the
managership of the Gold and Blue
track teams, Pitt adherents need feel
no doubt as to the future.

Director Miller said:

“Last fall when we went to Ithaca
some unforeseen misunderstanding
became conspicuous and almost sev-
ered our relations. I did not consider
this at that time of serious moment.
As time went by and we reaclied no
deﬁnite conclusi-on as to a game this
year, the importance of doing so at
the earliest possible date became the
thought uppermost in our minds.
Now thatvwehave been successful in
annexing a da~te——Nov. 9——this year,
we are going after a return game in
1913. It is our intention to have Cor-
nell play Pitt in Pittsburgh then. The
prospects f-or a 1913 game in Pitts-

couraging.” ‘ ‘
