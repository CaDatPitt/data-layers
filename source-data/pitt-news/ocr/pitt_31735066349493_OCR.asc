Insurance Costs Plague
Student Health Service

BY CONNIE GIEL

 A projected 50% increase in

student health insurance may
necessitate an overhaul of the
present Student Health Service,
director Dr. Joanne Robinson said
yesterday.

Robinson, addressing the Stu-
dent Government and its affiliate,
the Medical Action Committee,
said student knowledge and sup-
port is essential if the Health
Service is to survive in a usable
form.

An individual insurance policy,
administered by Blue Cross/Blue
Shield, now costs $122 per
academic year. Robinson said she

The agony... '

  

foresees a policy premium of at
least $180 and possibly as much as
$220 next year if the Health
Service’s funding base remains the
same.

The insurance program has
experienced a drop in enrollement
since its implementation in 1972.
The first policy was negotiated for
two years, with an enrollment of
7,704 students. This year 2,377
students opted for the policy. That
ﬁgure. doesn’t include teaching
assistants and teaching fellows
covered by the University.

Robinson said the enrollment
drop, coupled with the persistent
purchase of the policy by students
who expect to use it extensively,

* has ruined insurance negotiations.

“The problem with insurance
bids is that new companies get

figures from the previous three

years," Robinson said. “Last year,
we got only two bids. The other
company said they couldn’t price it
to make it at all affordable.”

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye said the drop
in enrollment indicates insurance is
a low-priority item for many
students. He said the need for a
competitive situation is obvious.
“The ﬁgures show we are out of
the leagues of most students,”
Moye said. -

“Right now. we can get away
with a pay-as-you-go service,"
Moye said. “But we’re up against
the wall. Service is not going to
exist much longer in its present
form."

Students on the growing waiting

Late applications for fall housing
are still being accepted by the

director Jo Ann Gibbs said.
“There is only a 50-50 chance some

of them will receive room assign-’

“Be sure to vote and to vote for your own convictions.” That is the admonition
of Teachers for an Independent Faculty (TIF). It is an insult to the faculty of the University
of Pittsburgh.

This slogan appears on items of TIF propaganda which by some mysterious pro-
cess turn up with frequency" in the University mail boxes of members of the faculty.

This slogan implies that, for some reason, faculty (other than TIF members, of
course) are likely to vote out of some other motivation than their own convictions. What
might those motivations be that would cause faculty to vote AGAINST their own convic-
tions or despite their own convictions—arm-twisting by “outsiders,” payoffs, fears of the
prospect of sloshing around somewhere in the mud at the bottom of the Allegheny?

The TIF sloganralso says to me that if faculty really vote their own convictions,
they will vote in favor of the stand taken by TIF. In other wo_rds,TIF is telling us less-
enlightened faculty members that if only we had the intelligence, integrity, and courage
that they have, if we seriously sat down and thought the problem through in the objective

mode of the scholar, if -we were as committed as they are to the welfare of the academic,

community, we would perforce ‘come to the same conclusions as TIF. We would see the
light of truth as TIF has been privileged from on high to see, and we would vote the way
TIF is urging us tovote. A ' '

I find such a smug, holier-than-thou, we-know-better-than-you attitude difficult
to comprehend—particularly in the scholarly community which has in long tradition laid

claim to the virtue of humility in the pursuit of truth. I guess I feel this way because I have A

greater confidence than TIF in the intelligence, integrity, and courage of my academic
colleagues. This feeling even includes colleagues in TIF; I feel no need to urge them to vote
“their own convictions.” I am sure they will do so without my urging of PSEA/NEA--Pitt or
any other organization or non-organization. I am also sure that when push comes to shove,
many TIF members will vote FOR collective bargaining despite——or perhaps because of-
the avuncular cluck-clucking of some members of TIF. A

I would even feel presumptuous in urging my colleagues, as TIF does, to “Be sure
to vote.” Unlike TIF, I have sufficient trust in the faculty to know that anyone who chooses
NOT to vote has made that decision on the basis of his own convictions.

Finally, I am certain that, in determining “their own convictions,” faculty will
refuse to be dependent upon the/ admonitions of Teachers for a Dependent Facutly.

facing union leaders, then, is not
what to do next week—it seems

highest number of votes. What
union leaders will be analyzing is
their chance in runoff election

particularly what position they may

the runoff either no-union or
pro-union take a majority—5l%.
That 51% is culled from votes cast,
not the number of eligible voters,
so that the unions, with seemingly
stronger vote organization, may
have a better chance in orchestrat-
ing the runoff than the no-union
people.

Indecision in the election rises
with the academic rank of the
voter. Assistant professors had
14% undecided, associate profes-
:sors had 15% undecided and full
professors had 19% undecided.

The Pitt News surveyed results
generally agree with ‘surveys
published by Everett Ladd and
Seymour Lipsett in The Chronicle
of Higher Education. These sur-
veys indicated that although 75%
of faculty are pro-union nation-
wide, only 25% actually are union-
ized. ’ .

‘Why? The Ladd-Lipsett analysis
suggested the political ideology of
some faculty members tends to
make them supportive of unioniza-
tion as a concept, but that these
faculty ‘reject the real manifesta-
tions of unionism on their own‘
campuses. This, coupled with the
perennially split between union
sympathy and the generally solid
no-union sentiment, adds up to
much verbal support, but less
voting support.

UNITED STUDENT CABINET
BACK TO DRAWING BOARD‘

A proposed United Student
Cabinet failed to materialize
Wednesday afternoon, due to lack
of participation bycampus groups.

The cabinet was proposed by the
Student Government Board (SGB)
as a vehicle for the unification of
student groups prior to Student
Affairs Advisory Committee meet-
ings.

“The cabinet could be seen as a
way for students to present a
united front in their dealings with
the administration" SGB member
Larry Gleason said.

Gleason attributed the lack of
attendance atthe meeting to a lack
of communication. “I don’t think
many groups actually received
notice of the meeting.” ‘

Gleason said a letter was sent to
all campus groups through the
campus mail, but they apparently
did not receive it.

Several groups were represented
at the meeting, including SGB, the
Resident Student Association, the
lnterfraternity Council, the Com-
muter Association and the Hockey
Club. Gleason expressed surprise
at the absence of the other groups,
especially the Black Action Society,
the Panhellenic Association and the
Engineering Student Cabinet.

"70 years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

 An Appeal to Reason

The approval last night by the Sudent Government Board (SGB) of a
proposal for the contending faculty unions makes it more difﬁcult for
the groups to reject some form of student participation, in the event
"collective bargaining wins at Pitt on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The SGB has dropped demand, from the Moser proposal for student
negotiators, and is now calling for the acceptance of student observers
only. This new position accommodates the unions’ objections to
student particijization and remains well within the spirit of Act 195.

' Now it’s up to the three unions to decide if they will follow through
on their promises to students and oﬁer a reasonable means of
involvement. Otherwise, they will become victims of their own rhetoric
as the election campaign nears its end. A j .

Students have a natural stake in their University, and advice by
certain faculty leaders that students "should concoct their own union to
look after their interests is a betrayal by professors and instructors who
would rather renege on their responsibility to students than meet them
eye-to-eye. ‘ ‘ ‘

By ignoring student interests, faculty are doing to students wha
they have claimed the administration is doing to them. '

Union leaders must consider seriously provisions for student
observers. Solid support by one of the unions for the inclusion __of

‘ students in collective bargaining could shift a critical percentage of the

undecided votes in its favor.
So student involvement is not only right, but also advantageous. ‘“

Directing the Fight

The debate at last night’s Student Coalition Against Tuition Hikes
(SCATH) meeting over the adoption of a statement of purpose clearly
shows, as we predicted, the group is in danger of being led by an
extremist element.

Two amendments steeped in radical rhetoric luckily were defeated,
averting at least temporarily the inviability of SCATH.

The general body of the statement of purpose also was riddled with
the platitudes of various political fringe groups.

SCATH must ﬁnd a comfortable center axis on which to base its
strategy or else face certain extinction. Increased involvement by
nonideological student groups like the Student Government Board and
the Resident Student Association would be the key to a strong centrist
position. I ”

A" lot of the discussion over the statement of purpose became
sidetracked over issues like abolishing the present Board of Trustees
and’ hitting the big corporations -with a 1% education tax, issues that

. obviously have no place in a forum on ﬁghting tuition hikes. An

effective central leadership could avoid the futile banner-wavingthat
tries to embrace a multitude of causes and hopes to solve them all with
neat little slogans.

If SCATH intends to take effective action someday, perhaps by
sitting down with the administration or the Board of Trustees, it can
only do so with a reasonable attitude and a bit less rhetoric. Where can
the reasoning begin except in the statement of purpose?

Revising Advising

The time has come for the
University to examine its faculty
advising system for. first- and
second-year students in the College
of Arts and Science. Entering
freshmen are randomly assigned to
a group advisor, usually a graduate
student in variousﬁelds of study.
These advisors advise the student
in making course decisions and the
registration process. That, in
essence, represents the extent of
their service.

Based on the requirements
needed for the job, these advisors
perform quite adequately. How-
ever. the college freshman needs to
be made aware of much more. This
is particularly true of pre-profes-
sional students. They need be
aware of information and access to

information ’ which will prove

America’s Majority Politics 

BY BILL KALMAN

“Only in the United States of
America can anyone, no matter
how poor, grow up to become
president.”

Every four years, during the
presidential elections, the famous
Horatio Alger myth is circulated
throughout the country. It seems
this is when, afterthey watch the
Democratic and Republican candi-
dates, the American people believe
it least.

Everyone knows that, in real life,

' anyone cannot run for president. It

takes special people—like white
males. White males have done a

_/‘/Trxemendous job of running for

president. Why, of the last 38
presidents, 38 have been white
males.

And you need two other
qualifications to run for president
(or, for that matter, any public
office): 1) lots and lots of money
and 2) the label “Democrat” or
“Republican” after your name.

How does one acquire lots and
lots of money? Well, either you’re
born with it (like the Kennedys and
the Rockefellers) or you jump into
the hip pocket of someone who was

born with it. This last point is‘

illustrated beautifully by the dozen
or so local politicians who were
caught taking illegal campaign

VF-aoigitributions from Gulf Oil. _
“»/Once your ﬁnances are arranged,’

you have to run as a Democrat or a
Republican. If you don’t, you can’t
get ﬁnanced. But it’s inconceivable
thatanyone could run for president
independent of “The Big Two.”
The two-party system is taught in
American schools as if it were one
of the Ten Commandments. The
two-party system is built up as the
only effective -and democratic way
‘to run the country. i
q _ But after Watergate and the CIA
and FBI revelations, the American
people no longer believe this. It has

to channel all political activity into
the confines of the two-party
system. And they have rigged
things so independent candidates
have to overcome tough restrictions
just to be on the ballot. This rigging
is done through an elaborate web of
campaign laws that vary from state
to state. One thing that is certain is
that these laws favor the Demo-
crats and the Repub1icans——they’ll
have their candidates on the ballot
in every state. . ‘

M The Pennsylvania Socialist Wor-
kers Party has been on the ballot

since 1948, in the face of stringent .

ballot requirements. Then, in 1971,
the state passed even more
restrictive election laws, tripling
the number of signatures required.
Obviously, the legislators were
worried that political developments
in this "country were creating a
climate favorable to socialist ideas.
They’re worried because the
Socialist Workers’ campaign repre-

Letter

sents a real choice in November.
Instead of voting for the candidates
of the ruling rich, Pennsylvania
voters may vote for candidates who
represent the majority of society.

So, if you see a petitioner on
Forbes Avenue, braving the cold
weather and the reactionaries, you
should help support the democratic
right of the socialist candidates to
get on the ballot. Even if you don’t
agree with socialist politics yet, you
still « can support the right of
socialists to get on the ballot.

By helping the Socialist Workers
get on the ballot, you’re helping
give . students and workers the

. chance to cast meaningful votes in

November.

And one day, in the not-too-
distant future, working people will
say to the capitalists, “Surprise!
This time we win!”

Refreshing News

Probably one of the most
enjoyable things about reading The
Pitt News is the features section.
After having read through the
drudgery of local and other news,
it's great to be able to go to later
pages and read up on people and
ideas on campus.

Like the Feb. 18 stories about
campus bus driver Jud Hilliard by
Steve Sybert, the meter story by
SteveiFine and the guest column by
Merril Hudson. We avid readers of

A The Pitt News enjoy any little bits

of change we can get. which don't
get put into the news that often.
I'm sure plenty of readers have

ideas for stories like these and are
interested in what is printed in the
paper. Getting people to suggest
what they have on their minds and
writing for the paper even if they
are not on the staff would

encourage readership and stu-
dents’ participation in The Pitt
News. 6

With all the new accepted forms
of journalism, it would not be
difficult to maker-The Pitt News
really be the “Pitt" News. A

Why Hike

I am a senior here and have lived
in the dorms for two years. The
first year I resided in Amos Hall,
whil this year I am a resident
assistant in the Towers.

Recently in response to the
announcement by the Housing
Office concerning a room price
hike, I have heard a lot of
complaining from various members

of the student body. I realize that '

this-is a bad time, economically, for
many students. but it is about time
that the residents realize why these
price hikes occur. ~

The vast amount of vandalism
performed each year in the dorms
is. phenomenal. A prime example
of these damages is the abuse of
the elevators in the Towers. Each
time a student illegally uses an,
elevator key, the‘ elevator core is
weakened. Of course, the use of
these keys is extremely widespread
and unnecessary. The weakening
of the core causes the elevators to
frequently malfunction. Each time
this occurs, a repairman , from
Westinghouse must be called in
and paid. I doubt that residents
realize how tremendously high this
cost is.

Other areas of vandalism exist

which appear to be minor, yet when
viewed‘ in their totality, are
extremely costly.
ples are the willful destruction of
lights, mirrors, security doors,
stairwell rails, painted walls, sinks,

toilets and carpets. The University '

can no longer afford to repair

damages in the dormitories with its

current room fee.

It is about time residents woke
up and become responsible mem-
bers of the University. Perhaps it

is unfortunate. the dormsare home '

for several thousand students each
year. The willful damaging of their
own “homes" is truly ironic. “ If

residents continue along this
course, room fees will go higher ‘

and higher each year. as the cost of

repairs increases. It is all a matter“ 0

of growing up and being respon-
sible for one's own actions. If this
vandalism is not brought‘ under
control by the residents and
stopped, all_of us will end up

paying more and more for other",

peoples’ immaturity. These
soaring costs leave the Housing

. Office no other alternative than‘to
raise room fees to order to cover

the immense repair bills.

become painfully. obvious that the
/:1,‘-igyo-party system is as corrupt as
»--.«'1ey come. According to a recent

Gallup poll, more Americans

consider themselves as “indepen-

dent” than as Democrats or

Republicans.

Both parties are run by the
handful of rich men who rule this
country—the capitalists. Through-_
out this presidential campaign, the
capitalists constantly will tell us we
do have a choice: ‘‘Pull the
Democratic lever and vote for us,”
or -“Pull the Republican lever and
vote for us.” Dutifully, the
electorate votes for one of the two
parties on Election Day; And the _
next morning, the capitalists say, ‘

ﬁgurprisel We‘ won!” If they
‘ 'anted to be truthful about it,
they’d move Election. Day from

November to April First.

If other parties, like the Socialist
Workers Party, want to get on the
ballot to challenge Tweedledee ‘and
Tweedledum, they have to go
through a hazing period. Third
parties have to collect tens of
thousands of signatures, often in
the dead of winter. But in
Pennsylvania, for example, Demo-

. cratic and Republican candidates
for the primaries have to gather
only 100 signatures. Supporters of
the Socialist Workers’ campaign
have to do a little more work. To
get the Peter Camejo and Willie
Mae Reid presidential ticket on the
November ballot, more than 30,000

ﬁsignatures have to be collected in a
‘three-week period.

country is afraid of independent

   “Gonna Get

 "TA College Bum"

, In response to an article
concerning beating the meters, the
use of the word vultures to describe
our friendly meter maids is very
unreal. They are not vultures at all.

They should be described more as

gorilla-like creatures, dragging

 their knuckles on the ground, pen
_ in one hand and their little book of

coupons in the other. These
Mongo-like creatures must not
have any sensitivity to them at all.

T "Give them a little power and they

go berserk, ﬁnding one ‘meter in
violation, then another and ano-
ther, constantly putting the screws

A‘ to the “radical, hippie college
’ freaks.” They say to themselves,

“Gonna get a college bum, yup,
yup, 'dat’s what um gonna do.”
One solution which can be used

an ammunition of nickels with you
at all times, so that when you see
one of them ready to write out a
coupon redeemable at traffic court
on someone’s car, you can
nonchalantly drop a nickel in that
person’s meter. This is a very
effective way to get the lovely lady
infuriated.'She is about ready to
drop the bomb on someone, and
you, the hero, save the day for your
college cohort. The gorilla’s eyes
will become red with ﬁre, smoke
will come out of the ears, the hair
on her chin begins to quiver, and
generally. you can hear little
undertones spewing from her
mouth. '
This has not been meant to
degrade the “maids” but is just a
reflection from one disgusted
student who does not like to play
little nickel machines, finding out‘
that the run from class was too late.
“Sorry, Charlie,” the note reads,
“this coupon good for one shaft,
redeemable at the Public Safety
Building. Do not pass go, just pay

The Trouble
With Transcripts

I would like to share an
experiene I had with the transcript
ofﬁce a couple of months ago. I am
a senior planning to. attend
graduate school.

At the end of fall term, I
approached the transcript ofﬁce
hoping to obtain my transcripts. As
I approached the door,_I came upon
a sign which stated that transcripts
which included fall term’s grades
would not be ready until Jan. 5,
1976. I was shocked to see this
because some of my graduate
schools had deadlines before Jan.
5. 1976.

Being totally powerless in this
situation, I returned on Jan. 5 to
procure my transcripts. As I was
reading them, I found a course that
I had taken over that fall term

‘ appeared twice on that transcript.‘

 

When I inquired about this, the
lady in the office said I neglected to
fill out a course repetition card. I
was shocked to hear this because it
' “at Wri=*ten anywhere about
ﬁlling out this card. I also asked the
lady when this would be corrected
and she said it would take about
two weeks. As a result of this, my

application would again be delayed‘

and my chances of being admitted
diminished.

I am still enraged about the total
lack of information about the
transcript office. l_t seems that this
University is more interested in the
money it receives for these
transcripts, than the students it
supposedly serves.

Long ago. on that famous day in

during the years to 200. Yet, with
200 dangerous communist inﬁltra-
tors in the government, Senator
McCarthy never once revealed this
list to the F.B.I.. or to any other
investigatory agency. , Never once
did he attempt to notify the
agencies these people worked for,
or notify their superiors. But, most
damaging to his case was that in
four years of an almost unbridled
reign of terror inflicted upon the
American people. his staffers and

McCarthy certainly made people

Coach For Fun, Not unds    

BY STEVE SYBERT

,/*5’ __

Pitt Hockey Club coach Lenny
Barcalow stops his pacing to light a
cigarette. Taking several steps
more, he searches momentarily for
a trash can, then throws the
burnt-out match into a corner.
Players are scurrying around,
getting ready for the game;

showers spray in the background,

Barcalow approaches his starting
goaltender Larry Newill. I
“All set Larry," he says, pulling
a piece of tobacco from the
Tareyton off his tongue.
“Yea, -Len. Where’s Jay? I need

of‘; some tape.” ,

” “Where’s Jumpin’ Jay? Where.

is that little beggar?”
Leaving his goalie and walking
down the corridor, Barcalow,
' dressed as fashionably as any of
the professional coaches, searches
for te team’s.trainer, Jay Irrgang.
Barcalow wears a matching gold-
and-green shirt-sweater-jacket set
and a white trench coat, topped off
by a gold snap-rim hat, which he
confesses is copied from the
Chicago Black Hawks’ coach Billy

_ Reay.

Players are dressing in the
corridor because the Pittsburgh
Penguins are playing later in the
evening and a Civic Arena dressing
room, usually allotted to Pitt, is full

{of the visiting team's uniforms and

equipment. His mind more on the
immediate game, though, Barca-
low stops looking for the trainer
and continues down the curved
hallway greeting his players.

“Ricky. You watch those jackass
refs out there today. I think we got
the Indian and his sidekick, the
Lone Ranger, that Mike guy. You
give it to them when they call a
penalty and they'll. be on their
horses and on their way out of
town. Where’s Sanders? Tell him
to keep his gloves on today. He can
meet the guy after the game in the
parking lot."

Vernon acknowledges, then
steps lightly down the path of
rubber mats, used to protect the
players’ skates from the concrete
floor, into the men’s room.

Barcalow takes a last drag of his
cigarette, then drops it to the floor,
crushing it with his foot. He takes
out lineups for both team-s and sits
on one of the many bright red
folding chairs lining the corridor
and begins to plot strategy.

Barcalow has directed the Pitt
Hockey Club to a record of 45 wins,
12 losses and 4 ties in his three
years at Pitt. This year’s 7-7-1
record is a result of facing stiffer
competition than in the past.

Since Pitt’s team is not under a
varsity program, Barcalow takes off
from his Allegheny County Parks
and Receation job to get no more
than personal satisfaction in return
for his efforts. His face is wrinkled_
and his hat covers a circular ‘bald
spot surrounded by gray hair. An
inch-long scar on his upper lip is
evidence of a past hockey career,
but his dimpled chin negatesgany
brutal characteristics.

Originally from St-. Catherines,
Ontario, Canada, Barcalow came to
the U.S. during the 1930s as a lover
of the all-American pastime,-
baseball. '

“I coached in baseball for a long
time,” he says, setting down his
lineups on an adjacent chair and
lighting another cigarette. “I went
up about as high as the semi-pros
and I had a chance to go to Durham
down there in what used to be
called the Tobacco League. This
was a long time ago. And I declined

for the simple reason that I thought ~

I could do better to help my folks at
home more than away, because I
had a job and made $82 a week.
Since I was the onlychild, it was
my duty to stay home and help my
parents."

Crossing his legs, Barcalow
takes a long drag from his
cigarette. He holds it ﬁrmly

between his ﬁrst two ﬁngers,
squinting as he draws in the
smoke. When he exhales, the
smoke billows upward and circles
around the array of pipes overhead
which intertwine between the air
conditioning and heating ducts.
“I was in the high semi-pros as a
hockey coach too, then I got into
these smaller leagues around

' elbows resting on his legs.

Pittsburgh. 1 went out to North
Park one day and asked if I could
skate with some of the younger
lads. There was a shortage of
coaches around to help those guys.

I must say Ihad the greatest kids in

, the world and they won all the

time. Hell, it was an easy job
coaching them. You'd tell them
something. and boom. they'd do
it.“
Although 66 years old and
always displaying his grandfatherly
image. Barcalow is amazingly spry.
donning his skates to direct his
players through their practice
sessions. Once, while coaching a
local high school team, two players
accidentally rammed him against
the boards during a drill and broke
his leg. Five weeks later, while still
recuperating, he tripped over a rug
at home and ‘broke the other.
Barcalow is glad when the games
come so he can take a safer position
behind the players’ bench and see
how his strategies work out.

“You see that some of your ideas
work and some of them don't. A lot
of times in games, we've been
really successful. But I've also
seen times when we've been darn
lucky."

Barcalow looks down at his
His
ﬁngers are intertwined and his
cigarette is protruding from be-
tween two of them. He spits on the
floor between his wing-tip shoes
and looks up. ,

‘‘I get the satisfaction of being
with a really great bunch of guys."
He nods in the direction of his
players. ‘‘I get more satisfaction
when they go out there and do a
terrific job. Like I've always said:
After our guys, everyone else is

changing lines.

The sound of running water
stops and two players, finished
with their pre-game showers,
return to the corridor to dry
themselves and don their equip-
ment and uniforms. Sensing that
game time is approaching, Barca-
low snuffs out his second cigarette
and heads down the corridor

through a maze of players, many
only half-dressed. He passes rows
of light switches and walks through
a portable ﬁberglass protective
tunnel, awaiting its use for when
the Penguins’ opponents appear
later. The Zamboni machine,
which resurfaces the ice, is just
ﬁnishing its second lap around the
rink, so Barcalow retraces his steps
and. once he is back among the
players, pulls out another cigar-
ette.

“Yea, I remember coming down
here all the time, when the Hornets
played," he says, referring to the
Penguins‘ American League pred-
ecessors who played here until
1966. “That's when Gerry
Cheevers was the goalie and he
was in the Toronto chain. But all

‘Urban centers grew up at the

X turn of the century; the urban ,

studies program at Pitt waited until

”._a few years ago to develop into a
. .. big program. -

The urban studies major was

I 5 established at Pitt in the fall. of

;1969, but the program" did not

 receive funding until June, 1974. In
 7 the fall of '74,
.- ' prospective majors. ‘Now there are

there were 44

115.
The budget is still not large
enough to hire urban studies

' faculty, despite that there are more

majors in urban studies than in the
geography or sociology depart-

' ments.

Elisa Ventura is ‘the only

I full-time staff member, but she has

.a title long enough for three
p'eople—administrative assistant

" and director of urban studies ﬁeld

placement.

Ventura said she feels the

' increase interest in the program

can be attributed to aspects of it

A‘ that are inviting to conscientious

students—the ﬂexibility of the

 program and ﬁeld placement,

which gives students practical

“The ﬂexibility of the urban
is attractive,”

FM. Tuning
Bookshelf Speaker Systems

Ventura said. “Students can take
courses from different ﬁelds in the
social sciences, such as political
science and geography, which
relate to their speciﬁc urban
interests.’’ ’

As the program stands, prospec-
tive majors must take 12 credits of
introductory social science courses.
The only requirement is that the
courses be taken in four different
disciplines. The purpose behind
this is to give the students a broad
background and 'a chance to
discover where their interests lie.

During the junior and senior
years, 12 credits of different
upper-level (1005) social science
courses dealing with urbanization
are required.

“There is no set pattern, no this-
course-follows-this-course setup,”
Ventura said. “The major gets into
different disciplines and ﬁnds
where his interests are.”

Although lack of structure may
have enticed many students into
urban studies, majors have come to
realize that, with the increased
participation and relative success,

some sort of structure may be:
.necessary. ’

A curriculum ad/visory commit-
tee, an informal group of concerned
majors in the program, have been

 jurbensiuaies ere ws up

formed to map out different
options and course routes students
may follow if they show interest in
a speciﬁc area.

Another problem is that the

department cannot hire professors
but depends entirely on other social
science departments to offer
courses concerning the city.

“Right now, we do not and can-
not because of our budget, hire
faculty for urban studies,” Ventura
said. “In the July budget request
we would like to be able to hire
faculty, especially to ﬁll in the
vacancies that are coming in the
fall with the department of urban
studies executive committee mem-
bers (associate history professor
Walter S. Glazer and political
science professor Irwin F. Owen).”

The aspect that attracts most
students is the ﬁeld placement
service. Majors are required to
have two three-credit courses in
which they work in an outside
organization for credits, not salary.

“Field placement gives the
major a chance to work and publish
with such groups as Community
Action Pittsburgh or Pitt Planning,
working not just in Oakland but all
over Pittsburgh, Ventura said.

“It gives the major the practical
experience that is soimportant in

the outside world.”

One senior urban studies major
said it was ﬁeld placement that
pulled him to urban studies. "‘In
urban studies, you get some
practical experience, and ﬁeld
placement gives you the tools you
can use when you’re out,” he said.

An urban stuides major who has
found the entire urban studies
program rewarding is Chuck
O’Neil, who was active in organiz-
ing community groups during the
civil rights movement in the ’60s.

“During my years with the civil
rights movement I came into
contact with a lot of formalities of

‘Elisa Ventura is the only full-time staff member’ in the urban studies

government .which I didn’t quite
understand,” O’Neil said. “Now
with some background in urban
government I can grasp some of
this.

‘‘I'm really interested in com-
munity functions, and.through my
ﬁeld placement with WQED I’ve
come in contact with a lot of special
interest groups and community
action groups,” he said. '

Possibly. as a result of being an
unrecognized department with no

‘faculty, the students have taken

a great interest; in the development
of urban studies.

Urban’ studies- majors now
publish a monthly newsletter in
which a student will describe the
ﬁeld placement with which he has
been working. Addivional ofﬁce
space has been given to the
program at 218 Oakland Avenue,

‘ but the problem of how to maintain

two ofﬁces with only one staff
member has arisen.

The newsletter and ofﬁce space
may seem like small accomplish- '
ments, but to a growing urban
studies department with much
bigger plans, they are only a-
beginning.

“Some people in the University
don't feel that urban studies is
important,” O'Neil said. “But it’s
a‘ legitimate discipline.”

 E ,“Madama Butterfly"

I

BY PAMELA EUSI

Hats off to Maria Pellegrini. Her

vocal and dramatic ranges literally  ' '
shook Heinz Hall last night_in a '

superb production of Madama
Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini.
Pellegrini last appeared in Pitts-
burgh two years ago and her return
was eagerly awaited.

Butterﬂy showed a compendium

‘of effort in the cooperation of

director, principals. chorus and
stage personnel. This was a grand
occasion to show off an exotic
rented costume or two. There were
no special effects as such but
overall the lighting stood out as the
best mood
changer. The opera seemed to ﬂow
along from one scene to another in
some of the smoothest transitions I
have ever seen. Credit to Pat
Simmons for these great moments.
A new idea was tried out by the
stage director Barbara Karp. As
"you walked into the hall the
scenery, house and landscape were
already present on the stage.
Throughout the entire production.
not a single curtain was used to
break mood, only the dimming of
the lights indicated when what
should happen did.
At the beginning of each act the
characters emerged onstage and
prepared the audience for the

, drama to follow. This agreed with

the fairy tale aura of the opera.
Not that the opera is for juveniles
Many factors contribute to
the emotional haze—the exotic
music, the Japanese setting and
the delicate lighting.
Personality standouts included
regular Arthur Graham as Goro
(He is a delight to watch. You can
count on his appearing in a number
of Pittsburgh Opera roles). Alex-

= ander Gray as Sharpless (this actor

gave a wealth of feeling to what
could have been an insigniﬁcant
role), Rita De Carlo as Suzuki
Butterfly’s faithful maid and
companiontand she had a great
voice to match her dramatic
talents) and Lee Cass as the
completely overwhelming Bonze,
uncle of Butterfly. ‘ V
Antonio Barasorda as the male
lead B. F. (Benjamin Franklin. no
less) Pinkerton, All-American Nav-
al ofﬁcer. came across as sharply as
a gunshot. His vocal talents

indicator and time=

succeeded where his dramatic‘
sense did not. With only four
professional years under his belt,
Barasorda can't be expected to
personify perfection and the
dramatics will come with more ease
and experience. .
Pellegrini gave an outstanding
performance as the heroine,
Cio-Cio-San (Madama Butterﬂy).

BY M. C. PILECKI

Drawing room comedies had
their heyday in the '30s.

That era of comedy was capped
in the '40s by what is still
considered as the best of the
bunch: The Philadelphia Story.

The Howard Hawks’ classic cen-—

tcred on the attempts of a young,
somewhat frivolous man (Cary
Grant) to win back his ex-wife
(Katherine Hepburn).

Not surprisingly, Grant was one
of the leading leading men for
many drawing room comedies. and
even less surprisingly, he's con-
nected ‘with Brut Productions,
which has been trying to revive the
lost art of sophisticated. upper-
class humor. When 'Brut's A Touch

of Class came out a couple of years ’

ago, the male lead was instantly
identified. as a Grant type. And
now with I Will, I Will...For Now,
the comparison is even stronger.
The plot concerns the efforts of a
somewhat frivolous young man to
win back his ex-wife. _ Sounds
familiar. Actually, any compari-
sons between the current release
and the 1940 comedy—though
tempting—wouldn’t be accurate
and totally unfair to the new flick.

coarse, oversexed character Les

Les’ ex. She comes across Well 85
the upper-class woman learning
her own mind and being outspoken

about it, while still suffering from a ~

few sexual hangups that include a
rather neurotic history of mig-
raines. _ a _

The best is Paul Sorvino as the

.“other man"——in this case Les’

lawyer and Katie's lover, Lou
Springer. An opera-loving guy who
sings arias at a moment's notice (or
less), Lou has, until the end, the
most sympathetic character of the

'movie.
Anyway. the plot. It’s some-V
where‘ around here. Katie and

Les——grumbling all the way—trav-

el to Katie's sister to attend her,

uh, not-quite wedding. You see,
she and. her lover have signed a
contract, with options, to live
together. _No marriage. .
Katie and Les decide to try that,
and Lou draws up the contract for
them. then tries to sabotage the

. arrangement. Complications arise

when Les’ wandering eyes wander
to a frustrated married neighbor,
and things wind up at a sex clinic.
A comparison ofl Will to the ’30s
comedies would be a lesson in
frustration and they-don’t-make-
‘em-like-that nostalgia. The olden
days featured much better-paced
dialogue and heavier doses of‘
wisecracks. Also, forcing the story
to be less explicitly sexual leads to
a greater delicacy in double
entendres. '
Not that I Will is a complete
loser. True, a doctor gag at the sex
clinic has such an involved lead-in
that by the time the too-obvious
joke comes off. it ﬁzzles. But for
the most part, the humor works.

 Tracksters 7

Last Chance- NCAAs

BY RALPH SPARKLE

~ The last meet of the indoor track
season is not necessarily the end
for the Pitt tracksters. The outdoor
season is just around the corner,
and a select few will be going to the
NCAAs, so tomorrow is just a
preview of the things to—come.
Tomorrow afternoon when Penn
State, Pitt-Johnstown and Virginia
Tech arrive at the Field House, the
Panthers will be hoping to set a few
records, school and personal,
maybe even qualify more people
for the Nationals. .
“We’ve changed the order of
events around to help the guys get
betterperformances,” coach Mike
Agostinella said. “By moving the
mile relay to the second event, the
sprinters will be fresh and have a
good shot at their goal. The relay
will be hoping to set a new Pitt
record and also meet the NCAA
standards.” ~ I

The distance runners also have
high hopes bettering their best
times. The three-mile and 1,000-
yard runs have been eliminated,
and only distances commonly run
outdoors will be featured. Bob Lee,
Terry Wile and Dave McDonald
will try the two-mile for a change of
pace, and most of the other runners
will be in shorter races, too.

Agostinella feels this will give
the guys a change and sharpen
them up at the same time.

“A lot of schools aim to peak
during the indoor season,” he said,
“but our program is geared more
towards the outdoors. We’ll be
faster and have our best perfor-
mances in the _ spring."

However, ‘the Pitt team has six
athletes bound for the Nationals,
and if the mile relay qualiﬁes, the
Panthers will have an exceptionally
large squad for such a young team
that is aiming to peak outdoors.

‘Nick Martin will step down to a
shorter, faster race——as will Mel
Boyd—to prepare for next week at

For the Panther basketball
program, the future is now. 'You’ll
be hearing a lot of predictions from
a lot of people for the 1976-77
season, ‘but probably none more
optimistic than this one from team
player Scott Nedrow:

“With the way the recruiting
seems to be going ane with the
work the players and coaches have
been putting in, I’d have to say that
next year Pitt could well be in the
top 10 teams in the country, and
maybe even the top ﬁve.” _

That’s saying a helluva lot for the

future of Pitt basketball, but then’

again, Nedrow will have a lot to say
about how the Panthers fare next
year in a tough new division that
includes the likes of undefeated
Rutgers, Villanova, Duquesne and
Syracuse. among the eight-team
ﬁeld. A ‘

Using the past as a blueprint for
the future, Nedrow took a nostalgic
look at the recently completed
campaign.

“We never quit and always came
back whenjwe had to,” Nedrow
said. “I think that gave all the
younger players some valuable
experience, something they’ve
learned that will deﬁnitely help
them next year.” '

Nedrow pointed to the string of
four wins at the end of the year as

It was a learning year for’ all of

And what of Nedrow? After three

Nedrow is getting his ﬁrst playing
time in the varsity lineup. As with
many other Panther roundballers,
his has been a story of untimely
injuries-—and how to come back
from them.

In his sophomore year, Nedrow
acquired a reputation and was
hoping to see some playing time.

SCOTT NEDROW

Then he acquired a leg infection
and was lost for the season. He got
a medical redshirt. . .

This year, his second sophomore
season, Ned averaged a respect-
able eight points per game while
shooting 48.5% from the ﬁeld.
“This seems like the ﬁrst time I’ve

“impartial referees" in order to
win the contest.

“I'll guarantee they'll be some
checking in front of the net," he
said. “There's no way it's going to
look like the Greyhound bus
terminal and like guys waiting for
the bus." ‘

Barcalow's chief concern is the
change of ofﬁcials for the C-MU
game. The two referees who

regularly ofﬁciate the Pitt- home

games are being replaced by
ofﬁcials from the Western Penn-
sylvania Hockey Ofﬁcials Associa-
tion (WPHOA), which, Barealow
said. doesn't exactly like the Pitt
hockey players.

“That was pretty easy to deal

N edrow looks back on the season

he said. “I shot well and haven’t_

Oakland and play with some of the
guys from the team. When you get-

the chance to play with Bill Knight

and Maurice Lucas, you have the
opportunity to learn and’ improve
your game.” »

The 6-3 junior guard will be’
making the improvement. As a‘
forward, Nedrow led his high--
school team, Ringgold, to a '29-2 
‘record in his senior year. “Under.

wrestling team. It proved itself in

_the face of adversity.

The Panthers were criticized
before the season began as a team

' not able to ﬁll the shoes of last

_year’s 8-4 winner. Graduation
supposedly left the team barren of

“ftalenti and experience.

To put it bluntly, Pitt was
predicted to bomb.

But like the bright sun peaking

' over the dark horizon, head coach

‘Dave Adams introduced a new
philosophy——aggressiveness. After
all, it only ﬁgures—if you don’t
have as much talent to go around,
you have to make up for it. And
Adams planned to make up the

-difference with aggressive wrest-
ling.-

The plan worked.

The Panthers made wrestling
critics cry in their beer by turning a
very good team into a very great

nation at the end of the season.

Pitt will be represented by ﬁve
wrestlers in the NCAA Champion-

and Bill Bailey.

Cirapplers End Great Season

Pitt has had a fantastic year. The
Panthers ﬁnished with a 12-4
record, 3-2 in the toughest league
in the nation—the Eastern Wrest-
ling League—behind national
powers Penn State and Clarion.

Among the many Panther
victims this year were prestigious
Navy, William and Mary, Lock

Haven, Tennessee and Maryland.‘

Then there was the satisfying
stompingof rival West Virginia,
25-11.

On the losing side, Pitt has
nothing of which to be ashamed.
The team suffered three of its four
losses to nationally ranked teams-
Michigan, Clarion and Penn State.

Wrestling crowds at Pitt also
have improved. What had been a
small group of about 500 fans at
Panther matches exploded to an
average of about 2,000. A horde of
yelling, screaming fans may have
been a big factor at home meets,
especially the 23-21 comeback win
over surprised Lock Haven.

Another reason for the Panthers’
improvement may have been
assistant coach George Bryant.
Bryant, a two-time, 126-pound
All-American at Pitt, was

lighter-weight wrestlers in prac-
tices.

But attitude was the key to Pitt’s
big-time success—an aggressive.

The season may be over, but the
competition is just beginning for
the Pantherette swimming team.
Today marks the start of the
two-day swimming and diving
championships of the Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate Ath-
letes for Women; better known as
the Easterns.

The competition at Trees Pool
will have 21 events; 11 will take
place today, the remainder on
Saturday. On both days, the
preliminaries will be from 10 'a.m.
to 12:30 p.m. and the ﬁnals from 5
to 7:30 p.m. '

Thirty-three schools will be
represented in the ﬁeld of 280
competitors.

“There’s a smaller
competing this year,” Pitt Coach
Kate Mathison said. “The
qualifying times are a lot harder to
make. so the Easterns should be
better this year.”

Last year. the Pantherettes
ﬁnished 11th in the standings.
With a 10-0 record this year,

Second Season Starts
For Women Tankers

(Continued from Page 14)

Mathison looks for her team to
place in the top four.

The strongest competition
should come from ﬁrst-seeded
Rutgers. Princeton (which presea-
sonpolls rated first in the East) and
Penn State. Pitt defeated the latter
two during the regular season. but
both ﬁnished above the Panther-
ettes at the Pitt Invitational in

»J."“?9€C€lTlb€t‘.
‘ " ‘Rutgers, which Pitt has yet to

face, is a formidable team. It will
send__l6 athletes to the competition
and is especially strong in the
freestyle with swimmers Vanessa
Jagenburg and Maureen Mantrell.

“They have a lot of strong
depth," Mathison said. “Rutgers
will probably take it. But there'll
be tough competition between Pitt

and Princeton for second."
Princeton, last year's top team,
still has a lot going for it with
freestyler Mary Sykes and breast-
stroker Liz Osbourn. Unfortunately

for Osbourn. she'll be up against

Pitt's All-American, Angie Lopez.
"Angie should show very well in
the 100- and 200-yard breast-
strokes," "Mathison said. Last
year. she finished third in both.

Lopez is the only athlete _among
Pitt's entered eight who has been
to the Easterns before. Most of the
other seven—Kathy Stetler. Kristy
Elston. Jamie Conley. Nila de
Jesus, Jennifer Price and divers
Connie Heister and Jenny Brooker
—-—are freshmen.

Stetler. who's seeded first in
three events. and Lopez could be
the key to a Pantherette victory.
