the ultimatum issued by Charles
H u g u s , chairman, yesterday
“Should there not be 300 tickets

for one dollar, with the balance of
$4.50 to be paid anytime before the
beginning of the dance, will be
rigidly adhered to. The reserva-

Gives History
‘Of Capitalism

Dr. Turner Traces Forms
In Inquiry Meeting

 

Dr. Ralph E. Turner, associate
professor of history, speaking at
the Inquiry Club meeting, Wednes-
day, drew for his listeners a com-
plete and interesting picture of
capitalistic movements and meth-
ods used, from the thirteenth cen-
tury to the present time. ’

“These methods,” said Dr. Turn-
er, “may be divided into four
schools of thought and expression:
Nationalist, Interdependence, Econ-
omical and Radical, in their order
of appearance.”

Explaining the Nationalist.meth-
0d, the speaker .told that this
group believed in a self sufficiency
to the exclusion of those around.
In this they argued large arma-
ments, for protection of self inter-
ests. The Interdependence group
believed in international coopera-
tion of interests. They, today, fav-
or the League of Nations and kind-
red ideas.

“The Economical or commercial
group, that in actual power today,
is composed chiefly, of the bank-
ing interests who beieve that
there shoud be a non-political ad-
ministration in international aff-
airs, and foster international in-
vestments, loans, and securities,"
said Dr. Turner.

The Radical group believes that
nothing can be done, and there
now is a world revolution impend-
.ing, which may change the entire
picture.

Pitt women will be given the op-
portunity to acquaint themselves
with the various phases involved

to the Future.”

The topic to be considered in
March will be “How to Make and
Live Up To a Budget,” a subject
which will treat the financial side.
“Hobbies" will be the topic for
April. The speakers who will ap-
pear at these times have not yet

Original Words For Songs
Written By Fraternities

 

Monday evening, January’ 18,
members of the women’s fraterni-
ties will meet in Heinz House
from 6 to 8 o'clock to participate
in a song contest: This event has
been revived by President’s Coun-
cil this year‘ for the first time

since 1923.

The competition among the sor-
orities has become very keen. “The
aim in sponsoring this contest is
not to produce a feeling of rivalry

quaint the girls with the various
events occurring among the soror-
ity girls through the medium of
song," says Hilda Rubin, Ed. ’32,

chairman of the contest, and pres-

ldent of Alpha Epsilon Phi.

Her aids, Mildred Wakefield,
Col. ’32, of Kappa Kappa Gamma;
Sally Moore, Ed. ’32, of Delta Zeta,
Helen Glynn, Col. ’33; Bessie Ra-
der, Ed. ’32, of Phi Sigma Sigma,
and Harriet Davies, Ed. ’32, of

spirit of friendly competition
shows promises of resulting in the
presentation of several clever, or-

whose song most nearly meets
the standards. ’

will observe the following rules:
First, the song is not to be more
than five minutes in length, Sec-
ond, a group must not consist of

the winning sorority each year,
but new plans have been made
whereby a new cup will be present-
ed to the winners each year.

Hears Talk

Hallock Outlines Studies
Before Business Men

 

 

Continuing his discussion on pro-
duction planning in industry as a
means of stabilizing business, Pro-
fessor Hallock, head of the depart-
ment of industrial engineering,
outlined the importance of time
and motion study as factors of
production planning, yesterday at
the University Business Men’s
luncheon meeting, held in the
Chamber of Commerce building.

“Since the ultimate aim of pro-
duction control should be the effi-
cient use of both productive ma-
chines and man power; and, since
mechanization has been carried far
enough in the United States, the
study of time and motion required
to finish a given product is impor-
tant in industry today, and woeful-
1y lacking.

“Time study, properly carried on
should make the job easier for the
worker while being done in less
time. Motion study should reveal
the proper actions to lessen work-
er fatigue in bringing about the
completion of the job,” explained
Professor Hallock.

“Time and motion study correct-
ly used may be of great help to
industry. Wrongly applied they
may do irreparable damage. The
executive who understands correct
time study technique can do much
toward improving the efficiency of
American industrial practice,” Pro-
fessor Hallock concluded.

rights in selling their tickets. A_c- ‘
cording to several of these stu-
dents, plans are being made to de-"f
mand the return of the books.

The majority of the conﬁsca-
tions were made Monday and Tues-
day as students exchanged their ac-
tivity books for generaladmission
tickets to the Duquesne game. Al-

State Hall, purchased student tick-
-ets for 50 cents, later reselling
them to the general public for a re-
ported price of $2.50,. _
The action of the Univensity, ac-' .

order to prevent student collusion.
with ticket speculators. “Pitt is-
going to protect the public from
ticket speculation,” he asserted.
“Students who break their agi“ee-_
ment with the‘ University by sell-
ing their activity book will sacri-
ﬁce their privileges. The student

use only and no extra fee is_ attach-
ed to the regular tuition price.”

V The present ticket squabble start-if

ed this week when the‘ demand for
tickets to the Duquesne game’,_
played Wednesday night, greatly
exceeded the capacity of the Sta-
dium pavilion. Students were com--
-pelled to exchange their regular ac-
tivity books for general admission
seats to the game. This was made
necessary by the fact that the pa-
Yilion will seat only 4,000 persons
and more than 4,500 student books
have been issued. About 2,000 stu-
dent books were exchanged. during
the two day period. According to
Harrison, no tickets were sold to
alumni or the general public until
all students presenting their books
for exchange had been accommo-
dated. .

Although violations of the non-
transferable agreement upon which
the activity books are. issued, have -
been reported to be general zduringp
the present year. the ﬁrst deﬁnite‘

that taken this week.

Harrison pointed out that each
student is getting $28 worth of ath-
letic tickets for $12, this amount
being‘ taken from-the tuition of the
Student and appropriated to student
activities, including athletic events.

A protest was also registered

Week hi’ students in the Pitt law
school. These students who have
all of their classes in the Chamber"
01? Commerce Building, downtown,
complained that no opportunity for
elfehange of activity books was.
given them. except the facilities of
the exchange office on the campus.

ENGINEERING GRADUATES.
JIIBIESS, Bl] Ill SBHIIIJI

Twelve unemployed gradu-
ate engineers of the Pittsburgh
district have applied to the
Engineering School to attend
day classes of the department
next semester without charge.
This plan of free tuition was
recently approved by the ex-
ecutive committee of the
Board of Trustees of the
School of Engineering.

According to Dean Elmer
A. Holbrook, it was the
thought of the faculty that
this plan would allow unem-
ployed graduate engineers to
review their «thecretical engi-
neering subjects and thus be
prepared for more responsible
positions when business im--

proves. It is not the plan of
the school to grant credit for
this work, but to allow the
applicants to attend for the
values that he may get from
the class work. .

is suffering a. natural letdown which comes to all sport champions just
as an economic depression is due to appear after a period of ﬁnancial

prosperity.

Pitt did not always possess good basket ball teams.

It was

not until the season of 1927-1928 that Pitt accomplished any-
thing in the sport which enabled the school to obtain more na-
tion-wide publicity; but preceding that period, Pitt's athletic
reputation was created by some championship football teams

turned out by Pop Warner and,

later, Jock Sutherland, together

with some brilliant individual efforts on the part of Pitt men
specializing in swimming and track.

Following Pitt’s ﬁrst year of prosperous basket ball, the
team went through the following three seasons with records
which were among best of all college teams in the country.
During that time, Pitttsburghers became so accustomed to see
Pitt trounce opposing teams despite overwhelming odds against
it that victories came to be more or less of a tradition.

Having at last tasted of the fruits of victory, the fans looked for-

ward to more victories and began

to expect more of the team. This

year’s team has had quite a time of it trying to hit a .500 average, and

the dissatisfaction of the fans has

resulted. Are these fans justiﬁed?
Just when Pitt was starting on its

years of basket ball prosperity, Carnegie Tech had its depression. Win-
hing one or two games a year was then considered quite a‘feather in

the cap of the Tartans.

Last year, with the addition of some promising

material from the freshman team of the preceding season, the Tartans
showed signs of improved form and ﬁnished the season with more vic-
tories to their credit than defeats charged against them. Were the

Tech followers mad? Guess!

As things look this year, Pitt is liable to ﬁnish the season

Pitt Boxers
Win Matches

Schricker, Conti, Take
Bouts At Uniontown

Jack Schricker and Harry Conti,
two of the most promising mem-
bers of the Pitt boxing team, in-
vaded Uniontown last Tuesday
night and won two matches in the
diamond studded belt tournament
that is held there every year.

The brilliant Schricker, 160
pounds, and only a sophomore,
displayed a classy form in knock-
ing out Mike Kaiser, Uniontown,
in the second round. Conti, 125
pounds, also worked smoothly in
winning the decision over
Komats, Uniontown,
round bout. Henry Martin,
pounds, also took the trip,
drew a bye. ,

Face Mountaineers

The varsity team is still practic-

but

ing hard in preparation for its first;
meet with West Virginia Universi-f

'ty January 30. The lineup of the
squad remains undecided and
Coach Orsini has declared that he

will not be able to give the names
of his regular boxers until the day
of the first meet.

In the 115 pound class, Norman
McCormick and Anthony Puglia
are battling for the regular posi-
tion with neither man having the
definite inside track. Harry Conti
seems the most logical represen-
tative for the 125 pound class with
Joe Namlick still holding a chance
to carry the Pitt colors. Marius
Santicola looks the best bet in the
135 pound class and Bill Schimpf
will be his understudy.

Gridders Fight

Henry Martin is leading all can-
didates for the 145 pound berth.
and Mario Rubbo is holding his
own with the other candidates.
Jack Schricker seems sure to be
the regular 160 pound fighter
while Joe McClure is his under-
study. Warren Heller and Francis
Siegel, both football men, are
fighting it out for the lightheavy-
weight position and Johnny Luch
and Johnny Love, two more grid-
men. are competing for the heavy-
weight post.

Last night members of the
squad journeyed to Freedom, Pa.,
to give several exhibitions at the
high school of that place. There is
no meet scheduled for the frosh
next week and the time will be
spent in intensive and much-need-
ed practice.

Pitt Swimmers Show
Potential Power in Drills

According to Pat Corr, the Pitt
swimming mentor, this
water team has quality rather
than quantity. Pat admits his team
is good, but thinks it would be
stronger if he had a larger squad.
With such men as Hanna, Adlers-
berg, Reilley, Patton, Carik and
the two Schmieler boys forming a
nucleus, the local university will
be hard to beat. Even though the
regular season has not begun, the
Panthers have already shown po-
tential ability in independent du-
els.

Even though the first meet is
still a few weeks away, Pat Corr
still insists on strenuous practices.
Pat has a system which seems to
be too unique not to be called or-
iginal. Every member of the squad
is timed daily. In the course of
the following days he has his yes-
terday’s record to beat. In the
course of a few weeks it is sur-
prising how each individual im-

Reiter Stars as Dukes
Win Opener From Pitt

Duquesne inaugurated its basket-
ball relations with Pitt at the sta-
dium Wednesday night and de-
feated the worn and weary Panth-
er five, 28-21.

A defeat for the Panthers seem-
ed inevitable from the sﬁfrst whistle.
Duquesne grabbed off an early lead
and the Panthers, still suffering
from the effects of their long west-
ern trip, were unable to maintain
a sustained scoring drive.

Marty Reiter, sophomore guard
for the Dukes, was the outstanding
man on the ﬂoor. His passing, drib-
bling, shooting and defensive work
were all high above average. Tim
Lawry was the big star for the
Panthers.

In the preliminary game, the
Duke freshmen came from behind
to defeat the Panther ﬁrst_ year-

men in an extra period game, 31-29.

Crib,bs, Pitt center, was the out-
standing star of the game. Three
Pitt men were ejected from the
game due to four personal fouls.

Mr. Lee Taylor Casey in the Pittsburgh Press

. . are dull and uninspired and the best is
third-rate he was interested neither in
literature nor art nor social problems nor public

Mr. Casey's imagination is evidently bound-
less. Discriminating men of literature agree that
Eugene Field is the author of, not mere jingles,
but some of the most beautiful child verses in
American Literature. His “Winken, Blinken,
and Nod” and “Little Boy Blue” are not dull and
uninspired. F'ield’s colorful, humorous folk bal-
lads of Colorado, e. g., “Casey’s Table d’Hote,”
“‘The Truth About Horace” are convincing the.

Homespun Humor

It still continues to be
favorite stories:

A husband was in mourning; after thirty-five
years of connubial bliss, his wife passed away.
The white-gloved pallbearers carried the casket
to the hearse, and the shrouded mourners fol-
lowed. The undertaker turned to the“ widower:

“You ride in the ﬁrst car,” he said.

“No,” was the answer, “I want to ride in the
second.” '

“I insist,” said the undertaker, “that you ride
in the ﬂrst.” —

After an argument that lasted ﬁve minutes the
husband agreed to obey the undertaker. With
reluctance he climbed into the ﬁrst car and turn-
ing to the other man said:

‘‘All right; I’l1 ride here as you request--but
you've gone and spoiled the whole day for me.”
