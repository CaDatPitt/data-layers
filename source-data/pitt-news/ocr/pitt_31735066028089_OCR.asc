Education officials, students fight cuts. . .

Department of Education calls $10 billion cut absurd

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

WASHINGTON — A
Senate proposal to impose a
fee on schools where stu-
dents receive loans would
discourage colleges from
admitting qualified, but
financially needy students,
according to the Department
of Education.

“This partisan, punitive
move is the last thing that we
need if we are to help more
American students go to_col-
lege,” said Richard Riley,
secretary of education, at a
press conference Thursday.

The fee, which education
officials called a tax, would
charge the school 0.85 per-
cent of each loan its students
receive and is part of
Congress’ overall effort to
cut $10.8 billion from stu-
dent aid programs over the
next seven years. i

“[The fee] is a disincentive
for schools to take needy
students in, no matter how
deserving,” said Marshall
Smith, undersecretary of
education. ’

The fee is just one symp-

tom, in Congress’ trend of

shifting the cost of balancing
the budget onto the backs of
students and schools, while
the middlemen — banks and
guaranty agencies — make a

fee is not a tax, since it is not
“scored” as a tax and it
applies to institutions that
already benefit from federal
student loan programs.

and parents more

afford, she said.

“If you look at
where the burden of
cutting costs is
being placed, 70
percent is being put
on students and 30
percent put on these
agencies that make
the profits,” Kunin
said.

Education officials
said the banks make
a profit of 8 percent
every year by han-
dling student loans.

Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum has
defended the bill she
is sponsoring by

ance.

Students from Pitt, Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon traveled to
a student aid rally on Friday hosted by Temple University in
Philadelphia.

Approximately 200 students gathered for the rally to hear stu-
dent speakers and Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell. Their speech-
es focused on proposed aid cuts and the importance of student
involvement through voting and letter writing.

One Temple student, a member of the student assembly.
compared the importance of one vote to a drop of solution in a
chemical experiment, which would result in upsetting the bal-

Federal budget priorities, including cuts in elementary and
secondary education, were the focus of Mayor Rendell's talk.
He said that the government was deinvesting in America’s
future. a _

After the mayor spoke, he was challenged by Kama] Latham.
president of Temple’s student assembly, to accompany the stu-
dents on a march to City Hall scheduled after the rally.

Mayor Rendell accepted the challenge and marched down

Ask Tele-foci how many

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

They have been asked, and have
found the answers, to what the going
rate for a prostitute is, what will be
served for lunch at Eddie’s, and how
many home runs Eddie Murray from
Cleveland has hit this year.

But they still aren’t sure how many
severed heads would theoretically fit
into Pitt Stadium.

The information source that finds the
answers to these trivial, and some not-
so—trivial questions at Pitt is the
Telefact information-by-phone service.

By using accumulated facts, figures
and contacts with research materials,

Telefact operators are equipped to give

quick and accurate answers to almost
any university or general knowledge
questions.

After five years of operation, this
service has built a database of answers
to questions that have been researched
and verified. These answers are orga-

interesting questions at Telefact.

Sweeney said a man called and asked
when his final exam was, so she con-
sulted a‘ course schedule. The test was
given two days earlier, and apparently
the person had missed his exam.

The infuriated man said that the
information was incorrect and for the
operator to re—check their source.

“So we called the department that
was. giving the test, and they patched
us through to the professor,” Sweeney
said. “When he picked up the phone, it
turned out that he was the one calling
us. He had missed his own final.”

Sweeney said that the office used to
get strange calls all the time, but after
getting caller—I_D, a service that tells the
number of a caller, the prank—type calls
have been less frequent.

Tracy Endy, a Pitt undergraduate stu-
dent and Telefact operator, quickly
writes down an answer given to a
caller.

nized and quickly accessed in any
of the three Telefact computers.

But what about the severed
heads question?

“We would figure out the vol- -
ume of Pitt Stadium first, then
figure out the volume of an aver-
age human head,” said Telefact
operator Keith McMellen. “From ,
there it’s just math.”

As a one-year veteran of
McMellen has
researched sports and scholastic
information for callers, and has .
even found a source of bulk con-
doms for one young lady.

He said though some calls may
seem funny, it is the operator’s
responsibility to find answers for
questions that aren’t against the
Telefact policy of not giving med-
ical or legal advice, or for opera-
tors to give out personal informa-
tion.

“We do get some calls, espe-
cially during finals week, that are
very strange,” McMellen said.
“But usually people just want to
know what is being served for
lunch, or for Pitt phone numbers.”

The wall of the ringing Telefact
office is covered by phone num-
bers ranging from the English
department to body piercing and
tattoo parlors.

Some numbers are typed and
neat, others are scribbled in an
obviously rushed attempt at get-
ting information down fast. Like
information packrats, operators
write down and keep the answer
for every new question that is
answered. They know someone.
else will eventually call for the
same thing.

The coordinator of Telefact, Pitt
graduate student Kathleen
Sweeney, has been answering
phones and questions with
Telefact for five years.

She said that the funny and
strange questions are what grabs
most people’s attention, b_ut the
office is a very powerful and
quick fact-finding tool.

“Most people just want a quick

tions like the one about prosti-
tutes, we have to tell them we
won’t answer questions about
anything illegal.”

Students will elect a new

the current SGB members said

they have made provisions for I

a fairer election.

“I am very, very, very

Some revisions include no

improperly using funds, as the
candidate will be blamed for
the violations and not the can-
didate’s staff.

Also, campaigning in the
residence halls, also known as
“dorm storming,” will be
brought back again this year.
This will allow candidates to
enter the residence halls and
go door—to—door to talk to stu-
dents. Two years ago, dorm
storming was a campaigning
technique, but last year it was
banned completely. In a com-
promise with the Office of
Residence Life, dorm storming
will take place on Nov. 14, for
four hours in the evening.

The only campaign materials
that will be allowed this year
are banners, buttons, leaflets
and a new standardized SGB
poster of all candidates.

Candidates will no longer
createttheir own posters, but
will give SGB a photo and an
essay, and all candidates will
appear on the same poster.

“This will help deter people
from ripping down other peo-
ple’s posters,” said SGB presi-
dent Julie Crowell. “No one is
going to rip down their own
poster.” ‘

Candidates will also give
SGB $50 to offset the cost of
printing those posters. This is
considerably less than what
individual candidates have
spent in the past.

“This levels the playing field
for those who don’t have large
campaign staffs or a lot of
funds,” said SGB member
Keith Campbell.

These posters will have all
candidates on them, except for
the write-in candidates. SGB
member Patrick Huey brought
up the problem of their exclu-
sion.

“In doing this, we’ve penal-
ized write-in candidates,” he
said. “If you’re a write-in can-
didate, you’ve lost 50 percent
of publicity that everyone else
had. We are shafting people.”

The board still approved the
standardized posters, saying
that write-in candidates will
have an opportunity to partici-
pate in other campaigning pro-
cedures.

reﬂects tough decisions that have to be made at

M _ this critical point in the effort to cut costs.

\“T‘o‘the charge that guaranty agencies and banks
will make it through the budget cutting process
unscathed, Kassebaum has saidilthat the package

achieves nearly $4 billion in savings from cuts to" 

these agencies.

“Taking the entire $10 billion—plus from lenders,
secondary markets, guaranty agencies" and Sallie
Mae would likely lead to the collapse of the guar-
anteed loan program,” Kassebaum said.

But Department of Education officials say even
attempting to cut $10.8 billion from the programs
is ludicrous and irresponsible.

“What we’re saying is $10.8 billion is absurd,”
Smith said. A more realistic figure would be $4
billion, he added.

Another proposal in the Senate bill that they
took issue with Thursday include limiting partici-
pation in the direct lending program. This pro-

“The idea for the contest
came from the Internet,”
said Michele Klingensmith,
business manager for
Vivarin. “It is such a hot
commodity  and we want-
ed to buy into it with some-
thing fun and interesting to
our target audiences — col-
lege students.”

College students can use
home pages to display parts
of their personality to other
Internet users.

“A home page is  simply
a way for someone to tell
others about themselves —
dislikes, likes, etc.,” said
Phil Greer, Pitt’s assistant
supervisor of the David
Lawrence Hall computer
lab.

“You can download pic-
tures and graphics. You can
use various backgrounds
and different types of print
to create your home page.”

In other words, a home
page is a fancy greeting on
the Internet. World Wide
Web users can call up a
home page address and get a
fullscreen layout of graph-
ics and text all designed to
greet, inform or direct the
user to any source of infor- A
mation about anything the
designer wants. ‘

have responded enthusiastically, according to Leo
Kornfeld, senior adviser to the secretary for direct

“Customer reaction to this has been universally
positive,” Kornfeld said; “It has been surveyed‘,

John Belush _ $3

and each time the results have been the same -
the customers are satisfied, the students are satis-
fied, the institutions are satisfied.”

Participating schools have reported that the pro-
gram has eliminated paperwork and conveyed
money more quickly. The lessened work load has
enabled financial aid staff to do more counseling,
Smith said.

During the first year of the program, 105
schools participated in direct lending. By July 1,
1925, the second year, 1,375 schools were partici-
pating. P ‘r i   A ’

If Congress caps the program\a_,t_, the 20 percent
participation level, about 1 million stuidents-who
are now in the program will have to be taken out,
and those schoolsthat planned to enter the pro-

because he likes what he’s
studying.

“Once you get more into
your major, your attendance
goes up because it’s something
you want to do,” he said.

Another CAS senior, Mike
Fuller, skipped classes regular-
ly his freshman and sophomore
years but has missed “hardly
any” classes this semester.

“It’s a sign of growing up
and maturity,” he said.

Fuller admitted he “could’ve
done better" freshman and
sophomore years if he’d
attended class more regularly.
A definite advantage of going

V to class: “You find out how

much easier it is when tests
come around.”

For freshmen who think
skipping class is the way to go,
Fuller had some advice. “It
might seem fun and easy not
go once in a while, but it will
definitely hurt you in the end,”
he said.

Maria Peterson, a graduate
student assistant at the
Learning Skills Center, sees
skipping classes as some stu-
dents’ way of exploring their
freedom.

“They’re used to having to
be places,” she said.
“Everything in college is an
option, it’s the initial thrill of
having time off.”

Most people who use the
LSC in the fall are there
because they feel they need the
help, Peterson said.

“If they haven’t been attend-
ing class, they are more willing
to attend,” she said.

But not all freshmen have a
take-it—or-leave—it attitude.

Three freshman women
hanging out in front of the
Towers have gone to almost all
their classes, but they know of
others who have already made
skipping a habit. “I feel guilty
when I skip,” said one.

Because Pitt is a major ath-
letic school, sports take priori-
ty over academics for some
student athletes. A senior male
athlete who asked not to be
named said, “I did not go to a
class freshman and sophomore
years except for midterms and
finals.” '

However, he has taken
advantage of the athletic tutors.
‘‘I can learn more from them
anyway,” he said.

One professor who has
taught at Pitt for over 30 years
also has an explanation for stu-
dent attendance.

“The most standard excuse is
the time of day,” said Chris
Rawson, an English depart-
ment faculty member. “It’s
hard to go to class early in the
day. It’s hard to go to class in
the middle of the day.”

“Remember, most professors
have been students.”

With a smile he added, “We
know most of the things that
go on.”

tant one on campus. )

And Kassebaum has
stressed that overall,

the gap between what you've saved and
what you'll need during retirement.

? Teachers Personal Annuity® now offers more
i ' ﬂexibility with the new Stock Index Account...
a variable account specifically developed for
the long-term investor who is looking for
more growth opportunities and is willing to
accept more risk. '
When you're planning for the future,
_.§: every dollar counts. Now you have more
choices to help you make the most of your
after-tax retirement dollars. With Teachers
Personal Annuity, you can select either our
Fixed Account or our new Stock Index
Account. Or, you may choose to allocate
your money to both accounts. That way you
can take advantage of the highly—competi-
tive effective annual interest rate of the
Fixed Account and the growth potential
offered by the Stock Index Account. With
both accounts, taxes on any earnings will be
deferred until you withdraw them — which
gives you a big edge over taxable accounts.
However, if you withdraw money before age
59‘/2, you may have to pay a federal tax
penalty in addition to regular income tax.
And remember —— as a variable annuity, the
Stock Index Account doesn't guarantee
‘ returns, which will fluctuate over time.
With a low initial investment, no front-
end sales charges or transfer fees, and no
surrender charge at this time, Teachers
Personal Annuity can help bridge the gap
between what you've saved and what you'll
need during retirement.

possibly not be able to juggle a job with
school for two more years to earn a bachelor’s
degree.

_The second concern over welfare reform
involves international students. Under reform,
the international student’s income and the
income of the family that sponsors the student
would be added together to determine the stu-
dent’s need, according to USSA. The combined
income would be too, high for some international
students to receive funding for schooling.

“The number of observers at USSA’s

USSA’s membership is very strong in the
Midwest, California and New York. Nationwide,
student groups like Pittsburgh Area Student

weeks ago students dressed up in foam-rubber sumo wrestler out-
fits (complete with wiglike helmets) during Campus Fest. We
also had the Bike Fair, the International Fair, the Fair Weather
Friend and the All’s Fair in Love and War.

Every one of these fairs revolved around corporate entities pan-
dering to students, receiving free advertising in exchange for pro-
viding some kind of entertainment for students. (You might have
even noticed that Vivarin had a’ booth at the recent Health Fair.
Yep, Vivarin — the product which can turn a healthy human into
a quivering amoeba in 3.8 seconds.) The entertainment they pro-
vide, however, is little more than juvenile contests more appro-
priate for elementary or high school than college students.

The union lawn has been turned into a third-rate carnival site at
least three times since school started. It is insulting and degrading
to college students to present this kind of image as something all
of us live for. If the people in charge of staging this kind of event
were interested in providing activities for students, how about
planning something with some kind of integrity instead of any
more of these childish fairs? After all, where is it carved in stone

' that life is a fair?

Justice, American style

With the long—awaited conclusion of the O.J. Simpson trial
finally here, people must be wondering what to do with them-
selves. Civics and judicial process teachers need to find a new
teaching aid since the farce of the century is almost over. Well,
here’s a suggestion — how about looking at the real judicial sys-
tem in action. _

Two days ago in New York a federal jury returned guilty ver-
dicts against Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine others for
planning to bomb the World Trade Centeriand the United Nations
building and plotting to kill the president of Egypt.

There were no$6 million-an-hour lawyers before the 12- per-
son jury which returned the verdicts. There was no attempt to fili-
buster court proceedings because a police officer was biased
against the defendants’ race. There were no jury members asking
to be dismissed due to intimidation from other jurors. The jury
members were never even publicly named. There will be no book
deal for every person even remotely involved in the trial.

This trial was an example of the way justice can and should be
served. Take heart, Judge Ito, it’s over. And take heart, America,
it’s not all O.J.—style justice.

Evolution

respecting an
’ establishment
of religion, or
 prohibiting
-.7 the free exer-
cise thereof.”
This is the
beginning of
our Bill of
Rights, and from this,
Americans have concluded that
anything other than the teaching
of evolution in public schools is
a violation of our Constitution.
Not only is the notion of “sepa—
ration of church and state” not
found in the Constitution, but
the First Amendment was
meant to apply only to the fed-
eral government. So if the
Constitution was so limited as
to permit even official state
churches, then why do public
schools abandon any thought of
creation?

Evolution is a sacred “fact”
believed by most members of
academia. So sacred, in fact,
that last year, when a letter of
mine published in The Pitt
News questioned evolution, I
received a lengthy letter from a
Pitt professor. I was informed
that there is “considerable
observational and theoretical
evidence in support of evolu-
tion.” So let’s take a brief look
at this “evidence.”

Probably the strongest argu-
ments the evolutionists use are
in the field of geology. Of
course, even this area is riddled
with holes. Nowhere does the
geologic column actually occur.
In addition, many fossils have
been found either too low or too
high in the geologic column.
For instance, in Glacier
National Park there is a block of
Pre-Cambrian limestone on top
of a Cretaceous shale forma-
tion. Evolutionists say that
forces thrust the “misplaced”
block over the other. However,
since the “misplaced” block of

 

Matt
Mills

limestone is 350 miles long, 35

miles wide and 6 miles thick, it
has been decisively concluded
that such large-scale sliding is
impossible. There is also evi-
dence that certain extinct ani-
mals, such as dinosaurs, lived
along with men. Numerous
human and dinosaur prints have
been found together throughout
the United States. The fossils of

trilobites, thought to have been

extinct about 230 million years
before the appearance of man,
have been found in a sandaled
footprint of a man.

The biological “evidence” of
evolution is even more laugh-
able. “Not one change of
species into another is on record
 we cannot prove that a single
species has been changed.”
These are the words of Charles
Darwin. The “proof” presented
in the 1925 Scopes monkey trial

' was the so-called Nebraska

Man. The evidence" of the
Nebraska Man was a tooth,
which was later found to be
from an extinct species of pig.
The Neanderthal Man is now
known to have been fully
human, with a cranial capacity
exceeding modern man by more

than 13 percent. Not only is ,

there no real proof of ape—men,
there is no proof of transitional
forms of any kind. One of evo-
lutionists’ favorites has been
Archaeopteryx, supposedly half
bird and half reptile. It has been
proven to be a true bird. Even if
it were a transitional form, it
should be one of millions of
such forms. No_t only are mod-
em organisms clearly identifi-
able as particular species, but so
are fossils. Darwin himself once
questioned, “Why is all nature
not in confusion instead of
being as we see them, well-
defined species? Geological
research does not yield the infi-
nitely many fine gradations
between past and present
species required by the theory.”
Good point, Mr. Darwin.

One of the core beliefs of
evolutionists is uniformitarian-
ism, the belief that the origin of
all things can be explained in

of the First Amendment

terms of the same natural laws
operating today. If this holds
true, for example, cosmic dust
particles, now coming to earth
at a rate of 14 million tons per
year, would have created a dust
layer 182 feet thick all over the
world. Our sun gives off energy
at a rate equal to that of a billion
hydrogen bombs being detonat-
ed every second. Such a rate
over billions of years would
have made its initial mass com-
pletely implausible. I could use
numerous other examples, but
The Pitt News won’t allow me
to devote five pages to my
topic.

Finally, I ask everyone to
consider the theory of evolution
in terms of a few common-
sense questions. How can ran-
dom mutations, ‘which are
harmful 99.99 percent of the
time, explain the enormous
complexity of modern life?
Darwin once noted, “The belief
that an organ as perfect as the
eye could have formed by nat-
ural selection is more than
enough to ‘stagger anyone.”
How can dead matter evolve
into living protozoans? In other
words, spontaneous generation
must have happened, although
it has been disproven by Louis
Pasteur. Surely,.if evolution
occurred on Earth, then why
haven’t we found signs of life
elsewhere‘?

I have barely scratched the
surface in my questioning of
evolution. If anyone is interest-
ed in further knowledge of the
topic (especially those in the
geology department), I recom-
mend a book called The
Collapse of Evolution, which I
used as a source for this article.
I have not even tried to prove
how the universe was created,
only that evolution is some-
where between questionable
and laughable. As the evidence
continues to mount in my favor.
someday evolution will not be
presented as a “fact" by our
esteemed educators.

Spiizer, the keeper of PiIl"s fate

By Ned Schano
A‘ For The Pitt News

Pitt soccer goalie Adam
Spitzer is starting his
senior year with a mission.

His goal for the team is
to make it to the Big East
0 tournament, then hopefully
win the Big East and

eceive an automatic bid to
he NCAA tournament.

Spitzer has also set per-
sonal goals.

“I want to be named to
the All—Big East team, and
I want to be in the top 10
in the country in goals
against average,” he said.

He reached one personal
milestone on Monday after
being named the Big East
Conference Soccer Co-
Defensive Player of the
Week. He made 10 saves
in Pitt’s 2-l upset over
eighth-ranked St. John’s on
Sunday. It was the first
time since 1985 the
Panthers defeated the Red
Storm.

These may seem like
lofty goals for someone
who has not been in top
form for the ,last two years.

After an outstanding
freshman year in which he
had a .71 goals against

struggled. Last year he
received a medical redshirt
after an admittedly poor
sophomore season.

Spitzer said that he was too
cocky during his sophomore
year, in which he split time
in goal with Kirk Brodows.

“I got it my head that I was
better than the competition.
Things just didn’t go my way
[my sophomore year].”

He was upset that he was
forced to sit out last year and
was eager to show he was
ready to take over the goalie
position this year.

Head coach Joe Luxbacher
believes Spitzer can return to
the form he had in his fresh-
man year.

“Adam is a key man on the
team.” Luxbacher said. “He
has all the tools to be a top-
ﬂight goalkeeper. All aspects
are coming together for
him.”

Luxbacher attributes
Spitzer’s improvement this
year to his work ethic during
the last year.

“His work ethic has
improved 100 percent,”
Luxbacher said. “This year,
Adam has been more aggres-
sive and going after balls.
He’s been steady in the net,

If you were a coach, and
your team went 1-3 in a
tournament, you wouldn’t
think you’d consider the
four games a success.

Over the weekend the’

men’s lacrosse team
played in a tournament at
the University ' of
Marylandglt was a 16-
team tournament, and
each team played four
games. '

“It was the first time we
all played together, and
we ended up playing the
toughest schedule down
there,” said head coach
Gary Neff. “We played
three of the top four teams
— Navy, Maryland and
Delaware. We could have
easily been 3-1, since we
only lost to Maryland and
Delaware by one goal. We
improved every game, and
the young guys got some
needed experience. I was
surprised and pleased that
we played with some very
good teams and were
never out of any game.
The weekend was a‘posi-
tive one.”

This year’s team is
young with 10 freshmen

and no seniors.

“We are very young.
The whole starting front
line from last year gradu-
ated,” Neff said. “Our
offense is struggling right
now, and it’s going to take
a while to get everyone
working together, but it’s
early so I’m not worried.”

In the first game on
Friday night, Pitt took on
defending champ Navy
and lost 8-2.

“We played well for our
first game, and we were
only down one goal at the
half,” said attacker Mike
Tanniru. “Navy was at a
higher level and was the
most organized and disci-
plined team at the touma-
ment.”

The next morning at 11
a.m., Maryland and Pitt
faced each other. Pitt had
the game won, but gave
up two late goals to send
the game into overtime. In
overtime Pitt had a clear
shot at the goal, but the
goalie made a kick save
on a bounce shot by
Tanniru. Maryland then
went on to win 5-4.

“We made mistakes late
in the Maryland game that
we won’t make later in the

season,” said Neff. “It was.

a disappointing loss, but it
was one we can learn
from.”

In the next game fresh-
man Rob Heaps scored a
hat trick, helping Pitt
break into the win column
against the University of
Maryland at Baltimore
County by winning 6-2.

“Rob played well in
every game, and he also
got better with each
game,” said Neff.

Against Delaware Pitt
had a 2-1 halftime lead,
but fatigue from the long
weekend set in and Pitt
lost a close one, 5-4. ‘

“They overpowered us
in the second half,”
Tanniru said. “I think
everyone was feeling a lit-
tle tired after playing three
games in less than 24
hours, but we still played
well despite being tired.”

“Overall I was pleased
with everyone’s play. Our
defense was great. We
gave up the fewest goals
down there,” Neff said.

The team will now pre-
pare for a tournament in
two weeks at West
Virginia University, fol-
lowed by a home game

IUP runs over
Pitt rugby

By Matt Dupuy
For The Pitt News

The rugby team had a tough outing this
past Saturday with a 14-8 loss to Indiana
University of Pennsylvania. Despite a
strong first half, shutting out IUP 8-0,
they couldn’t hold on to the lead at the
end.

“We should have won. This is a big
downer,” said Dave Jaeger. “IUP was the
better team at the end of this game, and
that makes the difference.”

Sean Tonkin was the lone scorer of the
day for Pitt. He scored five points on a
great run, and three points on a penalty
kick at the end of the first half.

“We are a team out there, and we must
do a better job of coming together as one,
and that means everyone working hard in
practice,” said Bryan Kane.

Pitt had a hard second half due to
missed tackling.

“We were fired up at the beginning,”
said Rob Mailliard. “It was 8-0 at the
half. In the second half we just didn’t exe-
cute or tackle.”

Tackling was the biggest factor cited by
the majority of players. Another aspect to
the problems of the second half was the
concussion to J .D. Groff.

“He is our leading scrum-half, and we
missed him in the second half,” said
Jaeger. .

He had to leave the game but is doing

Two men's programs f-cm victim to

By Nichole Gantshar
For The Pitt News

(Editor's Note: This is the sec-
ond of a four—part series about
Title IX and why the University
of Pittsburgh dropped men's
tennis and gymnastics, while
adding women ‘s soccer)

In 1991, as the University of
Pittsburgh interviewed candi-
dates for a new athletic director,
the athletic department knew it
had a problem. Yet, it took until
April 30, 1995, for the depart-
ment to develop a solution.

Ending men’s tennis and
men’s gymnastics was, “the
most difficult decision I’ve had
to make in 37 years,” Oval
Jaynes, Pitt’s athletic director,
said. Jaynes reached the deci-
sion after a long process. He
knew when he accepted the job
in Pittsburgh that this type of
decision was pending.

“When Mr. Jaynes came to
our campus in 1991, he was
made aware that we felt there
were areas of our program
where we were not in compli-

ance with Title IX,” Carol.

Sprague. associate director of
the athletic department, said.

1991 was a year of many
changes. “We also had a new
president coming on board, and
the budgeting process for the
university was changing,”
Sprague said.

Providing further background,
“that year The Chronicle of
Higher Education and USA
Today published statistics on the
role of women in college athlet-
ics, and the Supreme Court
ruled that women could seek
damages for being denied a role
in college athletics,” she said.

As Jaynes took office,
Sprague said the numbers for
Pitt did not look good. Then a
complaint was filed with the
Department of Education’s
Office of Civil Rights.

“We had investigators on our
Sprague said.
Moreover, Sprague and Jaynes
shared the OCR’s concerns with
inadequate facilities for both
men and women on campus.
“We have been looking for
space for more tennis courts
since 1992,” Sprague added.

An OCR routine audit of the
University of Pittsburgh raised
many concerns regarding “our
programs  participation 
facilities,” Jaynes said, and he
added “we agreed to 23 assur-
ances,” to resolve the concerns.

Discussions continued with
OCR for three years. In July of
1994 the campus was told,
according to Sprague, “we had
until April 30, 1995, to develop
a plan on how we were going to
affect our programs.”

Faced with the April deadline,
along with the university’s
Office for Affirmative Action,
the athletic department formed a
committee to make recommen-
dations and respond to OCR’s
deadline. The committee pre-
pared many different scenarios
to fund new women’s teams.
There were, however, no stu-
dents on the committee.

“The people on the committee
were representatives responsible
for administering Title IX and
our athletic programs,” William
Savage, director of the ofﬁce on
affirmative action, said in
response to The Pitt News’
question as to why no student
athletes were on the committee,

The only_ student input into
the decision to end two sports
programs came from a campus
survey. Part of the test to deter-
mine compliance with Title IX
is “to survey the interest and
abilities of your student body,”
Jaynes said.

The athletic department’s sur-
vey was conducted by the
University Center for Urban and
Social Research.

“Our survey showed that we
were meeting the needs of the
male population,” Jaynes said.
The numbers showed that
women’s interestin sports far
exceeded the opportunities
offered by the university.

The survey also demonstrated
that up to 50 percent of men and
women on campus “are poten-
tial varsity athletes,” Jaynes
said. 

In order to meet the survey"
results, and to meet with the
proportionality requirements of
Title IX, the campus would
need to add several women’s
sports teams. ,

Survey participants chose

women’s softball as their first
choice. Women’s soccer was
the second choice. Continual
problems with space and facili-
ties prevented the athletic
department from considering a
women’s softball team at that
time.

“Probably down the line we

, will add. other sports,” Jaynes

said. Soccer may have been
a compromise between facility
demands, financial concerns
and campus interest.

Jaynes said soccer was a pop-
ular choice because “it is one of
the fastest growing sports in the
NCAA for women.”

four seniors on a team,” Jaynes
said.

Jaynes denied waiting until
students had left campus to tell
the university community that
the teams were being cut.

“There is never a good time to
tell someone that their program
is being discontinued,” Jaynes
said about his decision.

According to Jaynes, the final
decision was only made in time
to meet the April 30 deadline.

Early in the process, however,
gymnastics became a candidate
for cutting in almost every sce-
nario the Title IX committee
considered.

“There is never a good time to tell
someone that their program is being

discontinued.”

— Oval J aynes
Pitt Athletic Director

Additionally, “in Western
Pennsylvania we have very
strong womenprograms [in
soccer] at high schools, and
there are very strong teams in
this area,” Jaynes said. “So the
pool of student athletes that are
available to us felt like this was
something we could provide for
students not only on our campus
but to students who would
chose to come to Pittsburgh.”

For the four years that this
scenario developed, the athletic
department continued to recruit
new athletes. Even when it
became clear that men’s gym-
nastics was a prime candidate
for cutting, nothing was said to
athletes.

“We were told by Jaynes that
he didn’t want to hurt the ath-
letes’ morale,” former tennis
player Mike Sullivan said.

Athletes were told they were
in a small program with low
expenses, so they should not
worry about being cut.

It was impossible to phase out
the sports, Jaynes said. “What

are you going to do with the '

freshmen and sophomores? You
can’t phase out until'the last
person is gone  and play with

“Men’s gymnastics had had
more programs discontinued
than any other sport in the
NCAA in the last quarter-centu-
ry,” Jaynes said. This trend
made gymnastics an easy target.

Last year, the NCAA execu-
tive committee recommended to
discontinue the championship
because there were no longer
enough teams to merit a compe-
tition. Perhaps since men’s
gymnastics is a high profile
Olympic sport, “at the confer-
ence last January, we voted to
have a couple of more years
before a ﬁnal decision,” Jaynes
said.

The Eastern Conference no
longer holds a championship,
and Jaynes asked, “who are you
going to compete against?”

 

Title IX

Pitt does not stand out as an
exception among its fellow
Division I members.

“Notre Dame dropped four

sports. Wisconsin dropped four"

or five sports several years
ago,” Jaynes said.

Acknowledging the dilemma
for the athletes, Jaynes said,
“There are no good answers.”

The reasons behind the elimi-
nation of gymnastics appear to
be a nationwide trend. The deci-
sion to cut men’s tennis is more
ambiguous. Sprague and J aynes
both cited facilities as a major
problem with men’s tennis. Yet,
varsity women continue to play
on courts cited as the slowest in
the division.

- Being competitive had a large
role in determining which teams
got cut and which didn’t.

Both Jaynes and Sprague
commended the men’s tennis
team.

“They played hard and repre-
sented this institution in a truly
first class way,” Sprague said.
He admitted, however, that it is
difficult to produce a winning
team with the current state of
the facilities.

Sprague added, “They didn’t
have the same percentage of
scholarship dollars.” As part of
the final decision, the commit-
tee saw that the men’s tennis
team was not “competing at the
same level as the other teams.”

The athletic department’s
decision to cut the teams was
popular with no one. Players,
coaches and administrators all
expressed regret.

“To me, playing athletics is as
natural as inhaling and exhal-
ing,” Sprague said.

The day Sprague and Jaynes
had to sit with the two coaches
“with whom I had worked for

years, and I respect very much,

Ellswortl'i's schedule Elwciyslras hergrunning around

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Some people like to keep busy.

Some people like to work 50 hours a
week or take 20 credits a semester to pass
the time.

Junior distance runner Stephanie
Ellsworth is very busy.

Ellsworth runs no less than eight miles a
day — seven days a week, participates on
the cross-country along with the indoor
and outdoor track teams, writes for The

~‘ Pitt News, takes 15 credits and maintains a

3.3 grade poirlt average. She also worked
two summer jobs. .

“It’s extremely tough,” Ellsworth said of
her busy schedule. “But I think the disci-
pline makes you more tough.”

This cross country season, Ellsworth is
having her best season as a Pitt Panther. At
the first home meet of the season,
Ellsworth ran the 3.1-mile course in 19:48
to place 10th overall while helping Pitt to a
second-place ﬁrrish.'

At the Malone Invitational in Canton,
Ohio, last weekend, Ellsworth knocked

. 1:26 off her time from last year at the same

New distance running coach, Dave
Sobal, seems impressed. A

“She ran a 20:53 last year at th
Malone,” Sobal said. “So obviously, you
can see a big improvement.”

The improvement in Ellsworth’s times
can directly be attributed to her olf-season
training program and improved confi-
dence.

“I came into this season in much better
shape,” Ellsworth said.

Ellsworth ran this summer at least ﬁve
times a week while working at the
Observer-Reporter, a newspaper that runs
out of Washington and Greene counties.

This summer Ellsworth ran in a ﬁve-
mile race in her hometown of
Waynesburg, Pa. She ran the race in the
low 34-minute range and won.

“I never won a race like that before. I
think that really helped out my conﬁdence
going into the season,” Ellsworth said.

Since the cross country season runs
through November, there’s plenty of time
for even more improvement.

“I really think that she’ll break 19 min-
utes this. year,” Sobol said. “She’s taken it
upon herself. to improve this season, and

And again, the immaculate master plan was being thrown

Now the whole world knew that Pitt was aiming for a

were depleting, there was a glimpse of hope. Admiral Billy
West was returning from a shoulder injury he suffered the
first battle of the year. He’s the key to the Panthers’ offen-
sive attack. He’s power and grace packed in a 5—foot-10

frame. Also, Denorse Mosley, who’s basically the I -5-”   

Panthers’ only defense against the air raid, was returning
from an ankle injury as well. _ _ _ _ , _ _ _
But the Panthers would have to be crafty to catch the I Getready to mlagme unhimted p°SS1b11meS'
Virginia Tech Hokies sleeping. The Hokies were the sec— i a An Equal Oppommlty Employer
ond-best defense in the nation, and they were fresh off a
huge upset victory over Miami.
The General had his troops conservatively plugging

moves, and the Panthers blew the battle, 26-16. They also
blew away themselves. ‘ ' e
That damn booby trap again. -
As the battle progressed, the General’s main men were
dropping as quick as their bowl plans. The Hokies were '
onto the Panthers’ plans, and they weren’t having any of it. ,
But the Panthers were still winning halfway through the ~

third quarter; then the booby trap started spraying rapid ’
fire.

Bam. Admiral West got hit. He broke his leg and will
miss the remainder of the war.

Barn. Dietrich Jells, the Panthers’ ultra-fast end zone
messenger, went down with an ankle injury.

Bam. Demetrius Harris, Admiral West’s shifty backup,
got hit in the toe. -

Barn. Mosley sprained his thumb.

What were the Panthers to do? The General’s heavy
artillery was empty. The master plan was now exposed like
a Capitol Hill scandal. P

They should have kept quiet. Because after all, the
Panthers might have won a battle or two, but they’re get-
ting killed in the war.

leader on the field. He admits he’s not the most

‘vocal player, but he tries to push his teammates to

do their best.

During the offseason Spitzer trained hard, work-
ing" extensively with assistant head coach Chris
Karwoski. Spitzer lifted four days a week and ran
three dayseach week.

“I said to myself, ‘I am better than I have shown
these last two years,”’ Spitzer said. “I put every-
thing else behind me. It didn’t matter what they
wrote about me, Ijust wanted play well.”

Spitzer was not really interested in soccer until
his junior year at Marlboro»High School in
Morganville, N .J . Although he received nine varsi-
ty letters, three each in soccer, basketball and
baseball, he decided to concentrate on soccer.

After receiving A1l—District honors in soccer,

Ken Gui‘ lo1i._Ei1giiiccifi11g

Spitzer was recruited by Connecticut, Towson
State, Seton Hall, Rhode Island and Pittsburgh. He
looked at Pitt originally because his club coach
recommended the school to him.

Spitzer eventually chose Pitt, he said, because he
felt like he was wanted. He was impressed by the
athletic department’s friendliness and hospitality.

Set to graduate in the spring, Spitzer said he
realized that this is his final year and he wanted to
make the most of it.

He has gotten into his mind that he will do what-
ever it takes to win.

Spitzer has received,a number of honors in the
last year. He was selected as a 1994-’95 Bell-
Atlantic Scholar Athlete. He received a great
honor this summer when he was asked to represent
the United States in the Maccabi Pan—Am Games
scheduled to take place in Argentina. Before the

beginning of the games, Spitzer said that he
“wants to make a name for myself.”

Pitt’s quick start is largely attributed to Spitzer’s
excellent play. He has two shutouts in five games.

But the New Jersey native is quick to point out
that Pitt’s early success is not a one-man effort.

“This year is more of a team effort. The defense
has played really well the first few games. They
have held the team together. Plus, our offense is

_ really coming into their own.”

“One man can’t win all the games.” Spitzer
added. “Our wins are a team effort. The better our
team plays, the better I look.”

Spitzer specifically pointed out the game against
Connecticut, where he looked good but the
defense allowed only three shots.

Adam Spitzer hopes that was one of many wins
for the Pitt soccer team this year.

better.

There were many positives in the
game. “The team is coming along,”
said Jaeger, “and Whitie [Kane] and
Tonkin really stood out.”

Other players noted for excellent
playing were Kevin Clancey and
Ryan Steppacher.

“Steppacher,” noted Kane, “was
playing in his first rugby game and
looked great for a rookie.”

Pitt must move on and put this
loss behind it because next on the
schedule is Penn State, which is cur-
rently ranked fourth in the nation.

“We are hoping to learn and move

must be focused for the game next
Saturday.”

“We need to work hard this week
in practice and work on many dif-
ferent things,” Jaeger said.

“We must be confident, everyone
at practice, and the focus be rugby
for the upcoming game,” Mailliard

said.

Penn State is sure to be undefeat-
ed in the Allegheny Rugby Union
and expects to walk away this week-
end with another win.

“We need to be focused and play-
ing above our ability to ensure an
upset,” said Mailliard.

Union consisting of Penn State,
Carnegie Mellon University, IUP,
West Virginia University and
Slippery Rock University. The top
two teams will go on to the Midwest
Tournament, and Pitt still has a
chance at the tournament.

“We are still very much alive and
have a good shot of going to the
tournament. We need to take one
Week at a time and work even hard-
er,” Jaeger said.

Pitt’s record stands at 1-1 with
three games left on the schedule.
