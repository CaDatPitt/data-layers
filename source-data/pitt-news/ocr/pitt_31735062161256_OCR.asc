THE UNIVERSITYAOF PITTSBURGH

FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 16, 1951 ‘A

University
Registers I
13,600

Bitter, near-zero temperatures
made the spring registration peri-
od the coldest on record, but
13,600 people, (a preliminary
total)disregarded the ice to regis-

ter last week.

This figure represents a de-
crease of 13 per cent in compari-
son with last spring’s preliminary
count, according to Dr. J.,G. Quick .
registrar. .

Approximately 130 first semester
freshmen were registered.

The use of the pre-registration
system enabled students to,com-
plete their registration in a mini-
mum amount of time. Quick claims,
some students going through the
lines in as few as 10 to 15 minutes.

As a result of this process, 2396
people went through on Saturday
morning, Feb. 10 alone, the largest
figure for one day in the history of
the University. ,

There was no apparent decrease
in the number of veterans’ who re-
gistered last week. This may be
the result, Dr. Quick says of the
imminent curtailment of benefits
for veterans under the GI Bill,
effective in July, 1951.

According to William F. Saal-
bach, veterans administrator for
the dean of men, approximately
800 veterans who enrolled in fall
courses did not continue, but an
equal number took their places.

Of these, approximately seven
were entering the University for
the first time, but the majority were
returning to take a last minute
advantage of GI benefits.

Enrollment in ROTC classes has
shown a marked increase, accord-
ing to C01. Holland L. Robb, head
of the department of Military
Science and Tactics.

Torhy is the final day for class
changes during the registration peri-
od. Students are permitted to change
or drop courses, however. through
the fifth week of this semester,
though special cases may be allow-
ed for after that time.

Refunds on tuition decrease from
week to week according to the sche-
dule set up by the treasurer’s office.
Veterans and draftees may receive
refunds upon presentation of their
orders to report for active duty.

Volunteers for military service
may not claim a refund of tuition, al
though they may receive credit for a
part or all of the courses they drop.

MC Store
Losing Out

Competition from the University
Bookstore is definitely detracting
from the profits of Men’s Council’s
Used Bookstore, according to
Ronnie Ecker, manager of the
Used Bookstore.

Ecker stated that while he could
not make va definite statement on
the total amount of the decrease in
sales at the eighth floor store, the
loss would probably amount to be-
tween $100 and $200 .

Although the store is slated to
close Feb. 24, there is still a
pressing need for more used «book-sj
to sell to the students, Ecker said,
and there is still a large supply of
used books on hand at the store.

Those books especially needed
are all English 21 and "22 books,
"Economics” by Ise, “The United
States” and all engineering,
science, and typing books.

Any person having any of the
above books may leave them at the
store located in 821 C1. If they are
not sold this semester, they will

berrkept in storage and sold in the-

bulletin board.

Major Joseph A. Hoffman, professor
of air science and tactics.
Major Hoffman will take applica-

First Aid Course Given
Here on No-Fee Basis

As a major part of Pitt’s civil defense program, courses in
first aid and first aid instructing are being offered on ano-cost,
no-credit basis by the University this semester.

Directed by Dr. Arthur Weigle of the physical education de-
partment, the program offers six campus sections and four Ells-
worth Center sections for students, and an unspecified number of

tions next week in 433 C1. Juniors
should apply Monday, Feb 19, and
seniors, Tuesday, Feb. 20.

Major Hoffman explained that
under present regulations, “Air
Force ROTC students of the class
of 1951 who will satisfy all pre-req-
uisites for a commission prior to
July 1, 1951, will be ordered to ac-

tive military service as soon as

, practicable after graduation.

"In addition, those Air Force
ROTC students who will satisfy all
requirements for
virtue of completion of summer camp
or its approved equivalent in 1951
will be ordered to active duty within
90 days after their appointment,”
he said. “

The ‘approved equivalent’ will
probably be substituted for the usual
summer camp this-year, because the
1951 summer camp has been elim-
inated entirely due to lack of facil-
ities and of training sites.

University To Accept   
Freshmen  

Under the accelerated program graduating high school seniors

will be admitted to the University in
June. Previously no beginning fresh-
men were accepted until the fall
semester began.

According to Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, the new regulation is
designed to enable younger students
to complete asmuch college work as

for the draft.

Used In Last War

A similar program was in effect
here during World War II. .It was dis-
continued in 1946.

All undergraduate schools will
participate in the new setup. Begin- V
ning students‘ who hope to get into
professional schools later will be
included in the program.

At the same time the University
will offer a regular summer calendar
for students already attending. There
will, however, be no accelerated
courses in the graduate schools.

Regular schedules will be followed. 0 ‘ ‘

Fulltime students in ROTC have
been advised that they must con-
tinue their training at the same
pace as their acaderric advancement.

courses which will reduce the length

IHarvard’s Kerner Tells

discussed by Dr. Miroslav Kerner,
first Student Congress Assemblies
speaker of the semester, to a group
of only 90 Pitt students yesterday.

Dr. Kemer, member of the Hat-
vard Bureau of Russian Research
and the National Committee for Free
Europe, pointed out the significance
of the premature organized resist-
ance movements, and the ability of
the Czech people to laugh at the
Russian dictators in his country.

In a review of recent Czech rela-
tions with tlie USSR, Kemer said
that because of their central geogra-
phic location and the country's long

slovakians have had an opportunity
to play a more significant role in
the history of Europe than other
nations.”

 Week Set

With the beginning of the 1951
Religion-in-Life Conference, March
4 through 8, Pitt students will take
time out to study and discuss their
problems with special emphasis on
religious issues.

Gerry Pendro, student chairman
of the conference, has announced
"Is Faith The Answer?” as the

theme. Well-known national reli-
gious leaders will base their talks
in assemblies, classrooms, semi-
nars, conferences, and fireside ses-

tion.

Hadacol ‘Discoverer’ Has a Cousin Here

83’ CLARK SUTTON

Kids aren’t dumb any more. They
used to ask their bewildered parents
inst exactly how Saint Nick could
travel all the way around the world
and deliver toys to every child- all
in one evening.

Now, they point
boards and proudly show their know-
ledge by stating that Santa Claus
can perform this remarkable feat
because he drinks HADACOL.

Humorous as this may seem,t_here
are a large number of children, and
an even greater proportion of adults,
who will swear that Hadacol is the
greatest cure-all to be put on the
market.

On top of that, they will tell all
who will listen that the creator of
this remarkable fluid, Senator Dud-
ley LeBlanc, is practically a mes-
siah to those who ache, creak, fal-
ter, or are just plain run down.

, “And this admiration,” according
to his cousin, DeNux L. LeBlanc,
Asst. Professor of geography at
Pitt,” is what will probably put him

in the govemor’s mansion of the

state of Louisiana.”,

“I haven't seen Dudley in about
15 years,” he said. “But the minute
my name is mentioned, I am either
laughed at or thanked.” His stu-
dents in geography get a big kick
out of reading of his cousin’s activ-
ities in the patent medicine field,
and never hesitate to send him
magazine and newspaper articles
that make fun of the Senator’s
Hadacol.

Diversified Career

As tohis connection with Dudley’ s
financial empire, Professor LeBlanc
stated thatthe last contact he had
with Dudley was when he worked
for Western Union as a kid. “I al-
ways liked to deliver telegrams. to
Dud because he was such a lavish
tipper.”

Professor LeBlanc said that Dud-

to large bill-

came aloqg. Then his cousin was
booted {out of politics and practi-
cally out of the state.

"He’s been running for Governor
for as long as I can remember, but
he will probably get it this time.”

Professor LeBlanc came to the
University of Pittsburgh a year ago
this month because he didn’t like

Professor LeBlanc has taught in
seven universities, has lived in
Paris, London, Algiers, and many
other foreign cities, but when he
first got off the 73 Highland and
looked at the Cathedral of Learning,
he wm “staggered.”

"I never saw anything so amazing,

"politest and
ha-rdest working students” he has
ever met. He believes that the fact

that many of them are first and sec- .

0nd generation immigrants ' gives
them the insatiable desire to learn
and study and “get somewhere.”

"Pittsburgh,” he said, "is a very
polite town-—except when you’re
driving. I've never been cussed out
in my life by a stranger until I came‘
here, but when I'm driving—well,
that's something different.”

Want a ‘Lift?’--
Local Ones

Declared Safe

Pitt’s elevator-riding students
don't need to worry about plung-
ing down 36 ﬂoors in case of an
accident. Tliey’re as safe on
their vertical trips as they are in
bed.

Several safety devices as well
as regular inspections give the-
elevators the maximum of safety.

A ‘limit switch’ will stop all
machinery of an elevator if it
fails to stop at the pre-determin-
ed floors.

If the car overspeeds, a govem-
or on the top of each elevator
hatch controls a mechanical brake
which stops the car.

An electric brake also operates
when the car is already stopped.

In addition, the car will stop if
the door is open on any ﬂoor.

According to its originator, Dr. L. M. Clark, president of

Kiski Prep, it will supposedly sat-
isfy the Army’s critical manpower
situation.

The new program if passed, would
call for the induction olf all 18-year-
olds and college students. .It has
been submitted to the Military Sub-
Committee of the House and Senate,
and if accepted, will affect a
schools in the country.

Training Would Begin June 1

If the bill is made law, basic
training would start this June with
the men divided into three groups:
1. All men who are 18 or over and
who are now in, or planning to enter

inductees‘ in groups 1 and 2 would
continue to serve in the Army, but
would live at the college or school
to which they have been sent.

Biddle Condems Plan

Localizing the plan, by which the
the armed forces would take charge
of the administration of all schools,
except for education, Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men, stated that a
program of this nature would cost
the public an-~ exorbitant sum of
money. In case of an outright war,
he said, the proposed plan might be
approved in its initial stages but if
continued it would be resented be-
cause of excessive expenses.

"Ifsuchaplan were to be passed,’
said Dean Biddle, “our schools and
colleges would be turned into mili-
tary_§E_§demies.” -

which recently tapped coach Len Casanova and band director
Bob Arthur as honorary members, have been using as mistletoe

their fraternity ﬂower?

Don’t buy any speculations about Druids going coed, though,

because the radical element isn't

strong enough.

Mistletoe today means romance
and stolen kisses, nothing like
ancient times when pagan Druid
leaders gathered it by climbing trees
bare-footed and made home-brew from
the leaves.

The romantic connotations of

I PHtPoH I

By ISABEL LUBOVSKY

At the last meeting of Student
Congress on Monday, Roy Titch-
worth suggested the idea of having
a student bulletin board where per-
sonal messages could be posted.
Titchworth cited Carnegie Tech as
an example of a school that has
such a bulletin board.

In line with his suggestion the
question was asked in this week’s
Pitt Poll: “What do you think of
having a ‘bulletin board centrally
located for personal use of students

which would carry all kinds of mes-

sages and would be subject to no
restrictions?”

DOT] Milletary, Col. ’53: "A grand
idea, particularly for a political
campaign since the school doesn’t
allow publicity for candidates

. through the use of the present bul-

letin boards.”

Howard Greenberger, Col. ’51:
"I think it is very necessary and
with reasonable restrictions could
be a real success.”

Lester Brailey, assistant to the
dean of men: “I think it's a good
idea. I’m sure we can trust the stu-
dents.”

Gertrude Christie, Col. ’54: “I
think there is a definite need for
a means of communication
among students and I’m in favor of
this proposal.”

Bill Langier, Bus. Ad. ’52: “PVC
been told such a system is effective
at Tech for such personal messages.
Therefore, it should also serve a
good purpose and prove itself use-
ful at pitta,’

Jack Thomas, Col. ’51: "I think
that this is an excellent idea. In a
large school like Pitt where you
don’t see your friends everyday
this would really come in handy.”

Jerry Lynch, Col. '54: "The time
saved in using a board of this type
should be very beneficial. I’m for
it.”

Art Lopatin, Bus. Ed. “51: "I
feel with a school of this size and
no restrictions we would need a bul-
letin board 8 miles long.”

Paul Schwarz. Col. ’S2: "1 think

- it would be most helpful for both

intellectual and romantic reasons.”

Ken Pfalzgraf, Col. ’S4: “With
no restrictions it is apt to become
an eyesore.”

Nick Rossi, Col. '51: “I think it
would be very helpful especially for
coeds on campus.”

Marvin Jacobson, Col. ’52: "I
think it's a terrific idea for quick

‘and important announcements.”

William Saalbach, assistant to

the dean of men: "I think there is a .

need for a message center.”
Bill Goldberg, Col. ’S2: "1 think
it’s a good idea.” .
Adele Moritz, Col. ’54: "I think
that it is a good idea but it can

'.only be used to a certain extent.

That is, it should be utilized for
notices of an important nature and
not for frivolous comment.” _
Lang Krayer, Col. ’5 1: “There is
a definite lack of contact among the
students in a school as large as

A Pitt. A bulletin board in a central

location would help to alleviate this
situation a lot.’ ’

Katherine Mun-gy, Col. '53:
uDeﬁnitely, it is a good idea.
Shall we give it a try?”

the complete romantic, though. The
novel was part political satire, 
he himself was a lawyer and politi-
cian by trade. It's a matter of record
that when he did become enamored
of an innkeeper’s daughter who lived
in what is now Squirrel Hill, he
up'ped and bought her for $200 and
made her his wife.

Swimmers Meet Law

The success of the Pitt swimming
team undeniably depends on how
they crawl, but a certain small town
magistrate could never be convinced
that they travel like snails.

On a recent jaunt to Annapolis, a
car full of swimmers was humming
through a 40-mph zone.Stat¢ P01iC€a
hampered by chains, couldn’t catch
them, but they radioed ahead and
had apaddy-wagon pulled across the
road to halt the car. The travelers
were hauled out and lined up for a
“Who's the driver?” interrogation,
then taken before a magistrate.

the more it costs you, and the speed-
ometer in the car was stuck at 98.
The tax would have amounted to
more than $40, which is quite a
piece of change to cough up on
short notice.

The magistrate was not exactly

In this town, the faster you go, i

gentle in his reproof, but to the
travelers’ relief, the fine was re-
duced to 36_‘75..~Even then, the dri-
ver had to borrow from one of his
passengers.

The magistrate’s reason for leni-
ency is laid to a reluctance to be
tagged as a persecutor of Pitt's
athletic department. According to
one of the voyagers, he told them
that only a week before he had done
business with Carl Olson, our track
coach. Track coaches and swimmers,
you would think, should have a pro-
fessional right to be speed enthusi-
asts, but the magistrate doesn’t agree.

Caught up on your sleep yet, now
that black coffee ‘and benzedrine
days can be forgotten until June?

One lissome young co-ed told me
sadly that she had faced the facts
in one of her courses, deciding that
it was senseless to cram. Asked
why, she replied, “There are just
too many notes in music apprecia-
tion.”

The same young lady is repeating
an elementary typing course this
semester because she couldn’t find
the keys to success in the course
the first time.

We haven't explained for a long
while that OVERSET is newspaper
slang for unimportant little stories
that don’t get into the paper. This
column is an attempt to collect odd
of funny little stories or cracks that
make good reading but aren't real
news stories. If you have any con-
tributions, drop us a note or come
up to 825 C1. and tell us about ’em.

First Things First

Next week the Pitt News will publish a special edition which
will include stories on Pitt’s Civil Defense planning program,
headed by Viers Adams, director of the Ellsworth Center.

We'd like to say now, though, that Mr. Adams has done a
monumental job, perhaps the best job in the county, of adequately
preparing the University for a possible atomic war without creat-
ing any of the hysteria that county civil defense authorities fear-
ed.

He did this while burrowing out from a pile of work connecged
with other duties such as preparing the mid-semester graduation
exercises, and still found time to take _a much-needed vacation,
postponed from last summer. Yet his CD program, at least what
we have seen of it, is second to none in, its field.

* # * * *

The first major phase of his program to be put into effect is
the series of first aid training classes that begin next Monday.

Without trying to alarm anyone, we can't emphasize the value
of taking such a course too much. Mr. Adams’ main goal in the
whole CD program is to prepare each person to take care of him-
self and of others on an ind_ividual.basis in the event of disaster,
and a general grounding in first aid is certainly the prime re-
quisite in such a plan.

So take an hour off from the Tuck Shop or delay hopping that
street car for an hour and walk down to room 124 next Monday or
Tuesday. It will pay you and your fellow citizens to do so.

Because of its unusual combination
of properties, it is now being used in
everything from “squeeze-bottles”
for toiletries t6 cable insulation and
chemical-resistant linings.

“Alathon” was born when English
scientists used high-pressure synthe-
sis to create polythene, the solid and
semi-solid polymers of ethylene.

Du Pont scientists and others
added their background in high pres-
sure work to the ﬁeld of ethylene
polymers. This concerted effort pro-
duced a greatly expanded range of

Taking First Steps

The ﬁrst step of Du Pont chemists
and engineers was to produce poly-
thene in the laboratory to conﬁrm
earlier ﬁndings. Then the product
was turned over to chemical engi-
neers for pilot-pla_nt work. Finally, a
plant for full-scale commercial pro-
duction was designed by chemical,
mechanical and electrical engineers

Du Pont engineers opened up a whole

Penn State, the only common foe

DISCARDS from

the Sports Shuffle

By WILL DOERGE
Sports Editor
Football coach Len Casanova was cheered by the news that
Chris Warriner and Bill Sasparovic may be playing for him next
season. The Marines may allow the two gridders to complete their

college education before calling
them to active duty.

Along with Bill Sichko, the two
previously were scheduled to leave
for Parris Island
last week. It
seems that with
the prospect of
military service
staring Sichko in
the face, the Pan-
ther halfback lost
interest in his
school work and
‘resigned himself

 

to serving with
the Marines.

But Warriner
and Gasparovic, ‘ Sichko
kept on ‘working in school, and at
practically the last minute, the
Marines deferred them on account
of their school status -- at least

until the end of this ‘semester and
possibly longer.

Sichko, however, no longer in
good standing in_the university,
was called up as .schedulediI and is
now serving on active duty.

Now if the two transfer grid-
ders from Duquesne, Quarter-
back Blair Kramer of South
Hills. and Halfback Dick Pardini
of Dormont are allowed to play
this fall, football prospects may
be a lot brighter than expected.

1% things stand now, however,
Kramer and Pardini have to be
at Pitt 9. full calendar year be-

 

fore they can participate in var-
sity sports.

When Doc Carlson's Panthers
walloped a woefully inept Miami
team at the Stadium last month,
the rumor of “fix" was heard
around campus. Reports had
gamblers making a big killing
on the game.

On the other hand, Miami's
student newspaper intimated
that the team was upset by dis-
sension on their northem trip,
which may have accounted for
their poor showing.

Herm Meister has already left to
assume his new assistant coaching
post at California. There has been
no inkling yet as to his successor.

...F;osh wrestler Hugh Peery,who
qualified for the U.S. Pan American
Olympic team, leaves Monday for
New York where he'll work out in
preparation for the Pan American
games in Buenos Aires on Feb. 22.

The coach’s son will wrestle
in the 114.5 pound class against
entries .from other American coun-
tries.

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Two of Coach Rex Peery’s" grap-
plers, Ray Cappelli and Harold
Miller, are the one-two punch that
is leading Pitt to a winning season.
The Panthers have three more op-
ponents to meet-‘Frank in and Mar-
shall, West Virginia and Waynes-
burg. Tomorrow they face F 8: M

~viCtory in 12 starts.

The consistent winning combina-
tion that Cappelli and Miller have
formed may be new to Pitt wrestling
fans, but it’s simply a continuation
from..~.high school where both grap-
plers combined their talents to
down opponents regularly for little
Washington High School.

' Cappelli Undefeated

So far this season the duo have
furthered their one-two punch. Their
combined record shows 19 wins, 2
draws, and l setback.
Cappelli, undefeated 130-pound
junior, is the only winner, along
with Captain Jim — 
Conklin, to return 
from the 1949-50 1
squad. Ray con-
tinues as the top
Panther this week
with nine wins
and two draws.

The other half
of the winning
punch,‘ Miller,
has been taking
over after Cap-
pelli finishes, to
rack up opponents
in the 137-pound class. Harold
wrestled on the frosh team last
year, winning his numerals. He was

IF Bowling
Playoffs Set

lM‘Director Leo Bemis paused
long enough over the mid—semester
holiday to schedule the interfrater-
nity bowling playoffs for Monday

Fraternities that will compete in
the playoffs are Sigma Chi, Pi
Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Chi, and
Phi Epsilon Pi.

Individual honors belong to a
pair of PiKA’s, Al Lochnicar and
Ronny Livingston.

Lochnicar rolled the best_single
game, a blistering 232 While his
teammate, Livingston, posted a
three-game average of 199.6.

For the second straight year,
the IF champions, Phi Epsilon Pi,
added another first place badminton
trophy to their case.

The undefeated Peps were led
by Sam Shapiro and Jim Rosen in
the singles and Jay Gefsky and
Harry Roth in the doubles.

All students interested in or-
ganizing teams to compete in
intramural bowling and badminton
should contact Leo Bemis at the

All-campus badminton will in-
clude both singles and doubles

With the possibility of Conklin
returning to the 157-pound division,
Tony Razzano to the 167-pound
class, and Gail Ellis returning as
heavyweight, Peery hopes to have
his team at full strength tomorrow
against F 8: M.

Ellis, who missed the Ohio State
meet last Saturday because of an
injured shoulder, has registered
three wins while dropping one.
Before-he became eligible at mid-
term, the Panthers hadn’t won in
the heavyweight division.

Other probable starters include:
John George, 123-pounds, (5-5);
Frank Skirpan, 147-pounds, (6-3);
and Razzano, 16"-pounds, (2-3-1).

Either Joe Kane or John Masarik
will go in the 177-pound class.
Masarik’s record is three wins and
four defeats while Kane has three

B)’ DAVE LIPMAN

One of the main reasons for the
excellent 7-2 record of Bobby
Artman’s freshman basketball team
has been the fine all—around per-
formance of Clarence “Dutch”
Burch.

Dutch, a 6-1, 180-pounder, is a
graduate of Oil City High School
where he was a standout in football,
basketball, and track.

In the frosh’s nine games, he is
the leading scorer with 46 field
goals and 23 free throws for a total
of 115 points, an average of almost
14 points a game. ‘

Push Shot Artist

Dutch has a fine one-hand push
shot and he does most of his scor-
ing by means of this shot. He is
extremely fast and a tieamplayer
at all times.

In addition to
activity, Burch

his basketball
played second

 
10

string fullback for
football team last fall.
Dutch made the Oil City High
varsity basketball squad in his
sophomore year and he captained
the team in his senior year. Oil
City won the Section 2 title that
year, during which he broke the
Oil City basketball scoring record.

All-State Selection
During his junior year, Dutch
was an All-State second tea m selec-
tion and in his senior year his per-
formance on the basketball court
won him an All-State first team
position.

This is the way Harry Berry, the newly appointed assistant

Mr. Berry thinks that he's getting a liberal education here.

There is a reason for all of this
extra work. It can be summed up in
one word: deadlines. The Owl, like
all publications, has defirgite times
for its page to be in to the printers
and these dates are not subject to
tampering.

Overtime Pays

The overtime paid off last week
when 314 of this year's 416 Owl
pages went off on schedule to the
printer's in Buffalo, N.Y. A big
sign in the 829 C1. office of the
Owl brushes this victory aside with
a warning that 102 pages yet, re-
main.

Owl Editor Leizer Balk attributes
the successful passing of the dead-
line to his staff, most of whom
stayed late, Friday evenings and
came in Saturdays. For awhile they
brought their lunches and ate them
on the job, Later the business staff
furnished food from a delicatessen.

Lots of Work

Most of the work that goes into
the book‘ is time consuming and
must be done in a definite order.
After the pages have been laid out,
the pictures have to be sized and
fitted into the format.

When the photography and layout
is completed, the organizations re-
presented must furnish copy for
their pictures. This, according to
Owl Editor Leizer Balk, causes the
greatest delay. Some groups, he
explained, do not turn in their
information on time.

The 1951 Owl will be a landmark
in Pitt yearbooks, Balk declared.
For the first time in its history it
will have a four color cover. Few

Fine Arts
’ Society Gets
Around  

Nine members of the Fine Arts
Society viewed some of the finest
collections of painting in the U.S.
on a five-day tour of Washington
and Baltimore during the mid-
semester break.

”Arthur Goldsmith, fine arts in-
structor here whose eight years in
Washington as a government eco-
nomist qualified him as guide, con-
ducted the tour for the gr'oup.

At the National Art Gallery, the
students saw the 15,000-item Mel-
lon collection of ‘objects d’art’ and
the Gulbenkian collection of paint-
ings amassed by the “world’s
richest man.”

Dumbarton Oaks, they found, is
famous for its collection of early
Christian and Byzantine art be-
sides being known as the site of
important wartime conferences.
They also paid a visit to the Freer
Gallery, which houses oriental art
collections.

Outside the world of painting,

curiosity took the group to a “dull”

meeting of the Senate, to the Lib-
rary of Congress, and to the Foyer
Shakespearean Library.

Moving on to ’Baltimore, the
tourists visited the Walter Art
Gallery and the Baltimore museum.
Back at home again, four students
from the group took part in a radio
discussion: of the trip aired over
WPGH on Feb. 9 with Goldsmith

acting as moderator.
