‘All "Men Report Enjoyable
Time in Spite of Intensely
Cold Weather.“

The New Year -trip of the Muscial
Clubs Northern

turned out to be, in the opinion of men

into Pennsylvania

{icessful events in their history. It cul-

it was morning, with what is believed
to be the most cordial reception ever
tendered a similar organization.

Erie High School received the clubs
and their baggage in the midst of classes
and unannounced. But they rose to the
occasion and continued their lectures
un-til lunch time, when Autos, driven
for the most part by seniors of the school

drove up and carried the fellows away
by twos, fours and more to private resi-

dences where they were to stay for the

the seniors and Messrs. Green and Held,
Pitt natives 0 Erie.

Automobiles were in almost every case
placed at the disposal of the Pitt men
and carried them to the concert in the
High School Auditorium ill the evening.
Later they were taken to a dancing party
at the Kahkwa Club out on the edge oi
the frozen lake.

The work of Manager Anderson,
Leader, and Reader Reynolds, Reader
Marcus, the violin solos of Yardum, the
playing of specialties by Learlc-r Godfrey‘
with the guitar, the Glee Quartet, con-
sisting of Reynolds, Wright, Speck and
Marcus, the mandolin-banjo-violilI-
guitar-tambourine combination, tne
piano playing by Coulter, an.d in general
the Mandolin an-d Glee Cl-ubs in their
entirety received most favorable com-
ment at every concert. Sam Coultcr,
however, is now lost to the clubs as he
has enlisted in the aviation corps.

Dayton, Pa., turned out quite gratify-
ing.ly to listen to the first “tra-la-la and
plunk-a-plunk-plunk” Tuesday, January
first. The clubs started the New Year
right by performing in Home Concert
form and the audience responded ac-
cordingly. Owing to themany incon-
veniences encountered here and the ap-
parent lack of “the fair ones” in any
numbers, the fellows departed for War-
ren without abundant regrets.

Nlow Warren, Pa., probably thinks
that the Pitt nlen are all football playc. .
and are unsocia-bly rough. For here it
was that blood and bruise.s were en-
countered and a cold bath about 2 A. M.
was administered. The concert here,
though not over-enthusiastically re-
ceived, obtained applause nevertheless,
and the men performed in first class
‘sound just the same. They say Warren
is a ﬁne, old town, but they go to bed
there before twelve. -

At Corry’s Rex T-heater the Mandolin
and Glee Clubs were treated to a large
and appreciative audience and it so hap-
-pened that there was a dance afterward

anesthetics and oil shales. In 1908
he was sent to Europe by the

.Canadian Government to study the

technology of the shale oil industry
there. In 1909-1910 he was Associate

Corry is now a memory but it is a very
pleasant one to all of the men except‘.
the three, perhaps, who “hit the hay"
early. The only other remarks about
Corry were expressed by telling about’
the ten cent sundaes they serve tncle
and about being locked out at one of the
two hotels where the men stayed. The
train pulled out from Corry almost on
time, and as a result, they say, as thel
parallel tracks stretched out from thel
station and faded into the distance, fourl
figures were seen standing and waiving
with their baggage alongside, for they»
had waited too long and now were found i
wanting.

PATRIOTISM IS SHOWN

 

Phi Delta Theta Founded at
Miami in 1848'»-6 Charters
Granted——Total Now 85.

Delta Sigma Pi, -founded in 1908,
one of the leading undergraduate fra-
ternltles at Pitt, was granted a char-
ter at the national convention of Phi
Delta Theta which was held at In-
dianapolis last VVednesday ,and. will
probably be installed as the ‘Pennsyl-
vania iota chapter of Phi Delta Theta
on Founder’s Day, March 15.

The Delta Sigma Pi fraternity was
Organized when the University of
Pittsburgh was known as the West-
ern University of Pennsylvania.
After the removal of the University
to its present location on the Schen-
ley Farms the fraternity made its
home on Fifth Avenue an-d two years
later moved to its present quarters
on 251 North Dithridge street. The
charter members of the fraternity:
R. P. McKown, Ec. ’1l; J, L, Can-
non,  ’ll; G. D. Kammer, Eng.
’l2; A. B. Bannister, Mines '12; R. E;
G€0T8C, EC. ’l2; J. G. Richardson,
Eng. ’l2; had a deﬁnite purpose in
view. ‘Phi Delta Theta was unani-
mously chosen as the national frater-
nity the Delta Sigma Pi would strive
to attain. __

The Delta Sign1a‘Pi_is conceded a

fraternities in the University. In the.
past ﬁve years the fraternity has fur-
nished the University with four honor
students. The lnember-s of the Delta
Sigma P-i occupy a very large place
in the student activities in the Uni-
versity. The ybar just past witnessed
lnembers of the fraternity holding
some of the principal ofﬁces in stu-
dent affairs. One was president of
the entire student body; another was
editor-in-chief of the PITT WEEK-
LY; another, editor-in-chief of -the
Pitt Panther; another, editor-in—chief
of the Owl. Delta Sigma Pi -mem-
bers sit in the Student Senate, assist
in the publication of the PITT
\VE.EKLY, sing in the Glee Club,
participate in A the Dramatic Clu’b.
Their names can be found on the ros-
ter of the Classical Club, the Prodi-
gal Club, the Student Band, the Y.
M. C. A. and the various other stu-
dent organizations.

Members of the facility who are on
the roll of Delta Sigma Pi are: Dean
H. B. Meller; Director of Athletics,
C. S. Miller; Dean J. C. Fettermann;
Prof. I. G. Flocken, and L. W. Muc-
Intyre, instructor in Civil Engineer-
ing.

Phi Delta Theta is one of the old-
est and best known of the national
Greek letter college fraternities. It
has chapters in eighty-ﬁve colleges
and universities in the United States
and Canada and has approximately
17,000 members. Some of the prom-
inent names -in Phi Delta Theta are:
Former President Benjamin Harri-
son, Vice-President A. E. Stevenson,
J. L. Stewart, engineer of this city;
Eugene Field, J. S. Phillips, editor
of the American Magazine; C. W.
Baker, editor of the Engineering
News; H. R. Johnson, cartoonist of
the Philadelphia North American;
R. A. Jackson, president of the Rock
Island Railroad; Milton Updegraph,
astronomer; M. A. Howe, botanist;
V. L. Kellogg. zoologist, and A. W.
Butler, ornitliologist. A partial list
of the positions held by Phi Delta
Theta men show that one has been
Presir,lent of the United States, one
has been \'ice-President of the United
States, 12 have held cabinet «posi-
tions, 6 have been ministers to for-
eign countries, 5 have been United
States Senators, 33 have been Con-
gressmen, 8 have been Justices of the

justices of the higher State courts, 6
have been governors of States, 6
have been presiding ofﬁcers of Stale
Legislatures, 30 have been college
presidents or deans, 20 have ‘been

The ﬁrst letter from George
Ketchum, Assoc. Ec. '18, of ‘the U. S.
Aviation Corps, since hisyarrival on
tl'1e~0'the'r' side, was received shortly
before ChrisVtm-as. The letter was
written‘ on shipboard, and- of course,
dealt -solely with -the voyage. The
destination -of the ship was unknown
to-the -men. ' _ ‘ ‘ '
, George said he -had thoroughly en-
joyed -the trip, which was: made on an,
excellent ship, but that “Bill” Ar-
ther,_"17, had been exceedingly sea-
sick all the way across, his only re-
marks being repeatedly -stated fervent
wishes that he might die speedily.‘
“However,” ‘said George, “I point
with pride to the fact that on the
occasion of every alarm or boat drill
:‘Bill’ was the ﬁrst man on deck, fully
equtipjpediwith hi-sV life preserver, etc.
He is determined-to die, but just as
ﬁrmly. re-solved‘ ‘not to give any
Dutchman the satisfaction of hasten-
ingthat end.” .. - ‘ V '
‘The ..aviation stud

“cording to George, after learnin.g the
precautions taken to prevent any ac-
tivity on the part of the Kgaiser’s
helpers. Georgewas aistsigped on the
‘voyage ‘over to the position of com-
pany clerk, because ofhhis acquaint-
ance with the typewri=te«r. He says he
thoroughly _ enjoyed ‘the voyage.‘ _His
chief demand is for letters from« all
his friends, Vreading matter, and «spe-’
ciﬁc news as to /the doings of “The
Boys”-—gang name for Pitt teams.“
He remarks that there areua -lot of‘

Company and he was its president
until 1896, when it was ‘absorbed by
_the Consolidated Traction Company.
Coal Operator and Coke Maker.

In addition to his banking and trac-
tion interests he -became interested in
coal operating and coke manufa,c-tur--
ing enterprises. He purchased a large
interest in thlé *Connell.sviVlle -Coke
Company, which under his adminVis—V
tration =be-came one of the most suc-
cessful -coke-making companies inV
W'estern Pennsylvania. VHe was also
one of theVor«ganizers of the Monon-
gahela .RiVver Consolidated Coal'ancl
Coke Company and for years one of
its la'rgestVVstockkholders. _
In,l884V »Mr..V.‘Whitney ‘became a5
mem'b_er of the New York Stock Ex-
cVlV1VaVngVe.f At that time ‘he formed a
partnership with F. L. Stephenson,
whichdid business under the name of
Whitney 8: Stephenson, and for many
years he was recognized -as one of the
most -succesVsfu1 bankers and -brokers
in Pittsburgh. Ten years «ago the
‘partnership was di-ssolved and ‘since
that time Mr. Whitney tngaged in
the brokerage bus-iness. h V

due to his early aggressiveness and
comprehension, of ‘ street railway
affair_s.- V . «

For many years Mr. Whitney was
a director of the Union Trust Com-
pany and was connected-at one time
with ‘the -Mellon banking interests.

For -years ‘he was regarded as (ﬁe
