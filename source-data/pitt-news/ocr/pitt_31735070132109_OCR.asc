As a young black man, K Leroy Irvis
really wanted to join a model airplane club. .
Unfortunately, the other members of the
club refused to let him because of the color
of his skin

Instead of backing down, though, he
retaliated by fonning his own black model
airplane club. The two clubs often competed
against each other. And according to Irvis,
his club won 90 percent of the time.

Purple spotlights and red carpet -
trimmed with white lights illuminated the
Twentieth Century Club » on Thursday.
evening. The event was held to honor Irvis
with the world premiere of the documentary
of “K. Leroy’ Irvis: The Lion of
Pennsylvania.”

The documentary was presented in cel-
ebration of Black History Month.

in 1954. During his time there, he was a
member of the Law Review. Now he serves
as aPitt emeritus trustee, andin2001 the K.

In 1959, Derrick Bell and a few of his
friends decided to attempt to desegmgate a
downtown Pittsburgh restaurant.

» When he anived, he found that none of
his friends had shown up, and upon entering
the ‘restaurant alone, he was denied service.

Although he failed to integrate the
restaurant that day, Bell is able to look back
on that day as one of ﬂre ﬁrst steps towards
his ﬁght for racial equality.

“Whether I was wise in going in there is
anoﬂrer story,” he said

Bell was the keynote speaker in an all-
day symposium marking the 50-year

‘anniversary of Brown vs. Board- of

Education, the Supreme Court decision that

declared racially segregated schools uncon-

stitutional. ’ .

4 ‘Students bombarded Student
Government Board members with ques-
tions and condemnations at the board’s
Thursday night meeting, only a day after
SGB removed the United States Student
Association from its budget in a private
morning planning session.

“You secretively met and made a deci-
sion to eliminate an organization that so
many of us depend on and don’t even
know we depend on,” said Chase
Patterson, the Black Action Society’s com-
munity outreach chair.

The decision to remove USSA ﬁom

the budget, which was due on Friday, ‘

developed under intense scrutiny because
of recent attacks on the organization.
Some students have complained that
USSA, a student—lobbying group, holds
political views_ and agendas not in line with
the entire student body and, therefore,
should not be forced upon unwilling stu-

Missing formalhea

51-

 

costs some grupsmoney

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

Something strange happened at Thursday’s
Student Government Board meeting.

People showed up.

The Pitt Rowing Club, informally known as
the crew team, attended the weekly SGB meet-
ing in numbers unheard of this year whﬂe the
Board received a recommendation regarding a
prospective trip to South Carolina for the crew
team.

After armouncing seven other recommenda-
tions, the Allocations Committee chair, Josh
Taylor, got to the Rowing Club’s recommenda-
tion, in the amount of $0.00. En masse, the crew
team took to their feet

“Is anyone here from rowing?” President
Brian Kelly said with a laugh.

Crew Business Manager Kristian Pearson
stepped forward.

“First of all, this is our team,” he began with
a gesture to the crowd standing behind him. “We
know that this is a lot of money. We know that we
request a lot of money from you, but just know
that we don’t do it on a whim.

“Every single year we ask for a lot of money,
[but] we back it up,” he added.

The team raised $20,000 in 2003 through
fundraising activities, according to Pearson.

Pearson lobbied for funds to help cover the
cost of a trip and training session in the south.

‘There .isn’t one competitive squad in the
Northeast that doesn’t go down and get in the
water,” Pearson said. “It’s: not a spring-break
party trip. It’s not a spring-break anything. It’s

1 spring training.”

Board member Joe Pasqualichio questioned
Pearson as to why his organization did not attend
the formal appeal of the recommendation before
it reached the board. I .

Pearson responded that, to the best of his
knowledge, former SGB President Liz Culliton
instructed the crew tearn’s previous business
manager “to wait and talk to [the Board].”

“Suggestion to anyone who runs for treasur-
er or business manager:” Board member Charis
Jones said, “Do not take that advice.”

Jones then voiced uncertainty about ﬂre
club’s protest of the recommendation because of
their absence in the appeal process.

“A couple of other student organizations had
this same kind of glitch,” Jones said. “And I don’t
think that we Voted for them to get the funding.”

Pearson and his teammates, however, won at
least for the day.

The Board unanimously voted to reject the
recommendation. After a week of review in the

Allocations Committee, it will retum to SGB for

a ﬁnal decision this Thursday.

Bell: Brown irrelevant

Brown, page 1

Bell explained that the real moti-
vation for Lincoln issuing the procla-
mation was not to advance racial
equality but to prevent France and
England from supporting the
Confederacy, as well as to disrupt the
southern workforce.

“It also opened the way for the
enlistment of blacks,” Bell said. “And
by the war’s end, more than 200,000
blacks served in the Union army, and
fought and died in disproportionate
numbers.”

Bell used the same concept for the
Brown decision: it beneﬁted the white
population more than the black.

“The Brown decision was likely
motivated by the need to counteract
reports of segregation and lynching
that received international attention,”
Bell said. '

Bell spoke about the role the
Brown decision plays in today’s soci-
ety.

“The ' Brown decision, while
never overturned, has become irrele-
vant,” he said. ‘Today, we ﬁnd most
black and Hispanic students [are]
attending public schools that are both
racially separate and educationally
inefI"ective.”

Bell laid out three rules he saw

Introducing III —Network Call

when comparing various civil rights
decisions and policies from the last
two centuries. .

“The interest of blacks in achiev-
ing racial equality will be accommo-
dated only when that interest con-

verges with the interest of whites in “

policy—making decisions,” Bell said
about the ﬁrst rule.

Bell’s second rule stated that even
when there is the potential _ for
advancement in race’ relations, many
policy makers try to prevent it as soon
as it begins to threaten ﬂie superior sta-
tus of whites. I

Bell cited the recent setbacks in
achieving racial equality as an exam-
ple of the third rule.

“The rights of blacks are always
vulnerable,” he said.

When asked what.-the next sym-

bol of racial equality might be, Bell I

stressed the power of people.

“I think we should stop looking
for symbols; we should stop looking
for leaders. The great barrier is getting
people who are oppressed to realize
they are oppressed,” Bell said.

. When asked about his views
about whether the Supreme Court will
seek to erode civil rights in the future,
Bell looked at the present '

“They have pretty much overrid-

den everything already.”

being discussed fairly.”

' The criticism, which was initially
aimed at the actual omission of USSA,
quickly turned toward the Board’s method
of removing it from the budget.

“We felt blindsided by this,” said Jen
Stephan, a USSA regional chair. “It looks

to us and everyone else [to be] very shady.”

Josh Taylor, the Allocations

Committee chair, rose in support of the
Board. I -
“In past history, the items that have
been placed in the budget have not been
voted on in public meetings,” he said. “This
clearly is a very controversial request. As a
result, I think that what was done was in
fact the right method.”

The Board splintered against a tidal
wave of accusations, allegations and
demands. ‘

“I want a writtenstatement as to why
the United States Student Asociation is
being dropped,” former Board member
Michelle Agostini said. “I also want a writ-
ten plan about what you are going to do
about that loss of 500,000 voices on Capital
 ‘ .

Agostini went on to question the
integrity and merit of SGB.

“What is wonying me about this
Board extremely, and what has also wor-
ried me about-Boards in the past, is that

there seems to be an inability to discuss and -

truly act on the issues that are impacting us
every single day,” she said.

After a collective attack from the vocal
majority of the audience during the open
ﬂoor portion of the meeting, broken up by
four voices of support, the Board split into

factions in its closing remarks. . ‘

Board member Lauren Evette
Williams targeted the other end of the table.
“I can’t trust you to make decisions,”
she said to her fellow Board members. “We
were pressed to make a decision in 15 min-

utes. Where was ﬂie compromise? What V

happened to teamwork? All of you guys

questions the board’s decision

know that certain things were not dis-
cussed.”

Pushed to the defensive, Business
Manager Liz Blasi struck back.

“[I’m] being stabbed with these allega-
tions that are not true,” she said with tears
in her ‘eyes. “I am not the kind of person
who would go behind 15,000 students’
bac .”

Blasi added that she could have sub-
mitted the budget without consulting ﬂie
board at all.

Board members Joe Pasqualichio,
Matt Hutchinson and Joe Salvatore rallied
in defense of the board’s resolution.

“[It’s] not an issue of teamwork,”
Pasqualichio said. “[It’s] an issue of repre-
senting the students. Some people on this
board have their own agendas. I want to
represent all the students, not my personal

agendas.”

While the Board reﬁained from attach-
ing names to their attacks, ﬂie intent was
clear.

‘Tm sorry if you can’t trust me, but
those that voted for me do,” Hutchinson
said. “It was obvious that this was going to
be an issue.” ’ ‘

After the meeting, President Brian
Kelly worked to sort out the situation in-his
head." '

. “Every Board member knows USSA,” '

he said. “I think Lauren Evette Williams
was upset that she didn’t get her way.”

Kelly and members of the Board will
be meeting with a national representative of
USSA this week

“There was no decision. We just post-
poned it,” Pasqualichio said. “We simply
decided to waitand make it a supplemental

. request.” -

Kelly remained conﬁdent the Board
would continue to discuss USSA, but
added that should they arrive at a split deci-
sion, he would vote in opposition to ﬁmd-
ing the organization.

“If you ﬁrmly believe in something, I
don’t think you should have to compro-
mise,” Kelly said.

Irvis: the ultimate blackPanther, Hill says

Irvis, page 1

Hill jokingly said he had originally
intended to make the movie into a major
motion picture with pop star Bow Wow
playing Irvis as _a child and Denzel
Washington playing him as a young man.

Before the premiere, Hill assured the
audience they would not be disappointed by
the ﬁlm and compared it to dating. The audi-
ence roared with laughter as Hill explained
to them that both movies and ﬁrst dates often
have surprise endings.” He added that this

, movie would end pleasantly.

Hill concluded by calling Irvis “the ulti-

mate black Panther.” _

The documentary contained many pic-
tures from Irvis’s childhood. Numerous col-
leagues, family members and friends gave
testimonies showing their deep admiration
and respect for Irvis. Irvis himself also fre-
quenﬂy appeared in the movie to tell stories.

“It’s a very great honor to be a lion,”
Irvis said. “It gives you a reason to roar.”

A reception was held both before and
after the premiere. The audience was ﬁlled
with numerous community members,
including Mayor Tom Murphy. Each couple
attending was also given their own copy of
the documentary on DVD.

Iowa school forum leads to subpoenas

A federal judge has set a new
precedent for the apparent elapse of
civil rights in this time of terror.

The judge issued a subpoena to
Drake University, a private school
in Iowa with 5,000 students,
demanding records about a forum
called “Stop the Occupation! Bring
the Iowa Guard Home!” held there
Nov. 15, 2003 — a forum that
included nonviolence training for
those who would be attending a
rally at the National Guard head-
quarters the next day.

It asks for “all documents indi-
cating the purpose  in the meeting
and  persons that actually attend-
ed the meeting  and any records
of attendees of the meeting.” The
subpoena also requests all records
relating to the local chapter of the
National Lawyers Guild, a legal
activist group that sponsored the
forum. '0

It is shocking to see the federal
government commit such an egre-
gious violation of the rights to free
speech and assembly,’ to see it
engage in such draconian measures
against some kids who want to raise
what they see as legitimate con-
cerns over the conduct of their gov-
ernment.

This behavior ‘smacks of
McCarthyism, of Big Brother
watching closely over any who

\

would dare dissent. Of course, this
subpoena and all such anti—civil
rights actions are being cloaked in
the black-and-white ideology of
resistance to terror? if you’re not
with us, you’re with the terrorists.
That kind of unwavering unwilling-
ness to see nuance and to allow dif-
fering opinions to see the light of
day has no place in America today.

It’s disturbing to see such abus-
es being perpetrated, and perhaps
more disturbing that this news isn’t
being trumpeted the world over. It’s
subtle and nefarious, perhaps the
way the government wants it to be.

America is supposed to be a
beacon to the world, an example of
why democracy is the finest form of
government. We" are supposed to be
an example of human and civil
rights, a force for good in a world
of chaos.

In light of evaporating evidence
of weapons of mass destruction,
Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime -
one that didn’t allow for any civil or
human rights — is being foisted
upon the public as the reason for the
war.

While that may or may not be a
good reason for the continued occu-
pation of Iraq, it’s certainly a stark
ironyiin comparison with America’s
own shrinking andtcherished civil
rights.

His party is over just as it’s beginning

Dear Sex N’ at:

I’m in a wee bit of diﬁiculty here. So far
as physical relationships go, I’m ﬁne, until
we actually reach the mattress. It all goes
downhill from ﬂrere.

You see, I know how to
talk to women, how to woo
them, how to caress them, and
sofaraslknowamoneofthe
best damn kissers they ever
experienced (This isn’t opinion
talking, but the Words of my
lady-ﬁiends’ kiss-and—tel1
friends. Please don’t think I’m
being egotistical.) I have no
qualms about my physical
appearance or penis size.
However, in the sack, I have no
way to please women. The '
problem isn’t my style, the

problem is I’m so fast I can’t even DEVEL-

OP style. Captain Wmky is NOT a patient
organ  the longest I’ve been able to hold
out was less than seven minutes, with an
average length of two to three minutes —
and yes, I’ve timed it because I’ve been
becoming worried about this. As if this
weren’t bad enough, I have weak joints in
my hands making it painful to please women
with my ﬁngers, and even though I can kiss
their lips, my tongue seriously has to be pret-
ty weak  it tires out even faster then my
Friend Down Under. It is almost as if my
body is physically incapable of being able to
please women. I’m becoming unable to
enjoy sex, because I know I am so easily ﬁn-
ished and yet can’t help my mate out the
same way, and that is not the way I want to
be. The only solution I can think of is ﬁnd a
woman in the same predicament, but I’d
probably have better luck ﬁnding unicorns in
my closet, especially since sex isn’t exacﬂy
the top of my list for dating; some relation-
ships just come to that. Do you have any
advice that can help me out of this predica-
ment? ‘

Fair trade coffee: a symptom and a glimmer of hope

Looking at coffee, we can see both a
glimpse at the suffering that permeates
most of the developing world, and the
first signs of hope that it doesn’t have to
go on forever.

Coffee isn’t a special case. Most
agricultural products grown in the devel-
oping world are facing crises. But coffee
is the largest market commodity in the
world, after oil. So, the straits are espe-
cially dire here. We’re talking about
more than i 25 million families being
forced into poverty and starvation, large
scale corporations manipulating farmers
into interminable cycles of life and debt,"
and a total population of about 250 rnil—
lion people dependent on an industry
that is currently being pillaged. , _

I don’t wish to come off anti-busi-
ness, and especially not anti-capitalism. I
only wish to say that I am against any
practice involving large—scale exploita-
tion of human beings. And I try to do

. whatever I can to wash my hands of it. \

Currently, self—emp1oyed coffee
farmers are responsible for about 50 per-
cent of the coffee beans grown world-
wide. You must understand that these
people, and even the majority of the
small farms which compose the other 50

in percent, only grow the beans. They don’t

have the capital to buy all the machinery
’ necessary to roast the beans or do any of
the other things that are necessary before
the coffee can be sold. All of this is in the
handsof corporations that buy the beans

from the farmers. And there are four big ‘

ones who buy about 40 percent of the
beans on the market: Phillip Morris’s
Kraft division, Proctor & Gamble,
Nestle SA of Switzerland and Sara Lee.
So, we have poor and disorganized farm-
ers, scattered across borders with no
effective organization with which they
can approach collective bargaining,
forced to negotiate with four of the
largest corporations in thevworld.

'. What ‘has’ happened generally goes
as follows. The corporations play the
farmers off of each other and force them
to sell for as low as possible. In
Nicaragua, this amount averages about
60 percent of the cost of -production. The

' farmers are forced"into debt. They only

have coffee to sell and are not able to get
a’ high enough return on it to even con-
tinue production, let alone support their
‘families. They need immediate money
and begin to sell rights to their future
harvests to speculators for less than
tl1ey’re worth, simply to have enough
money to live. In this way they are
caught in a cycle of life and debt perpet-
uated by the‘ unmediated drive of corpo-
rations to seek the lowest price. Parents
pull their children out’ of school to stay
home and work. Local money is
siphoned out of the country. Society
erodes. Those less willing to give in turn
to more proﬁtable harvests like the
poppy and coca plants.

Good cowboys should try leaving their comfort zones

I’ve always been a fan of the saying, “If it ain’t
broke, don’t ﬁx it.” I sleep with the same
number of pillows every night, go to the
gym just about the same time every day,
and have a pretty standard order when I
go out for dinner. Usually, I defend my
lack of variety by snidely saying, “I just
know what I like.”

However, sometimes you have to go
out on a limb. “

My break in my standard weekend
routine of going to bed at some ungodly
hour in the a.m., sleeping until some
ungodly hour in the p.m., bathing, and
ﬁnally trooping around the streets of
Oakland with my friends came on Saturday. One of
my more original pals announced that we were all

going to go — brace yourself — country line dancing,
It is still unknown how she-knew about this place, and

I am still in a state of shock that we were able to get
our acts together and organize this littlecharade. ,_

After an hour of traveling — some middle-of-
nowhere, straight—out—of-a-horror-ﬂick,. sketchy—a_ss

back roads we found ourselves in, wel1,'Texas,eappar.-E:

ently. Our little white sedan rolled into a sea of pick-
up trucks complete with bumper stickers that read, ‘.‘A

encouraged us to “Start boozing and get dancing!”

I’ve never been one to shy away from
the dance ﬂoor. Then again, I’d never been
line dancing before. I grabbed my friend
and we got on the ﬂoor just as they were
wrapping up a lesson on how to properly
two—step. We missed most of the instruc-
tion, but ﬁgured, how hard can it be? The
music started and I’d say our performance
was on par with Shaquille O’Neal —
should he ever decide to make an appear-
ance in “Swan Lake.” Not exactly grace-
ful.

‘ _ A few squashed toes 1ater,we decid-
ed that two-stepping was for the birds and
we would stick to the straight line dancing, ﬁguring,
how coordinated could a bunch of white people
accessorized with cowboy hats be? Turns out,
extremely coordinated. These rodeo regulars were

phenomenal. They would stomp, kick, click, and turn,
 faster than I couldiblirik. Now that I think about it,

I’m “that gir ” who still has to use her thumb and
index, ﬁnger to make —the “L” to determine her right

 . from her left, so this probably wasn’t the best of ideas.

came on. Just aswe were beginning to pick up the

this wedding reception staple, but at least it was
something I knew. I should have known better. I’m
not that lucky. The country version is a bit fancier
than the standard slide, slide, step-backdeal that peo-
ple who don’t wear plaid shirts and bandanas are used
to. ~
By this point, I’m covered in sweat, frustrated,
and I can take a hint. Completely a ﬁsh out of water,
I decided it was time to pack it‘ in.

The whole car ride home, between bites of buffa-
lo chicken sandwiches, we can’t quit talking about
how much fun we had. Unable to control our laugh-
ter, we reflected on the events that transpired that
night, from one of us dancing with a guy not a day
younger than 85 years old, to those of us who could-
n’t quite maintain our equilibrium after a few
cervezas and paid for it by falling on the dance ﬂoor
and being trampled by a stampede of boot-scootin’
boogiers.

Routine is a reliable, standard way to maintain a

comfortable lifestyle. And while I don’t plan on buy- .

ing a pair of chaps anytime soon, I am going to try to
step out of my comfort zone a little more‘ often. Even
though it makes you look more awkward than
Michael Jordan when he was playing baseball, and
feel completely out of place, it sure is a hell of a lot of
fun. Who knows, maybe I’ll get totally crazy and
order a slice of lemon in my Diet Coke next time I’m

The Graffiti Rock Challenge returns

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E Editor

Editor’s Note: For the past few
years, The Pitt News has been ‘invit-
ed to be a part of the judging
process during the semi-final round
of the Graffiti Rock Challenge, the
preeminent competition to "find
unsigned local talent and expose
these bands to new and larger audi-
ences. . This year, Dante A.
Ciampaglia took part, along with
nine otherjudgesfromﬁthe worlds of
journalism, music management and
promotion, to find the next great
local band.

The Graffiti Rock Challenge, in
its 18th year and for the
first time open to all
ages, is hosted by Mr.
Small’s Funhouse in
Millvale. There are
16 bands competing

Every Monday, a H o l l y

section. -
The bands that took part

were ReJX, Everybody Wins,
Top 10 Idols and Alisium.

With a somewhat sparse crowd
bunched up in small groups on the
floor of Mr.
groups which represented the first
wave of fans of the four competing
bands and the die—hard fans of local
music in general — the 18th Annual
Graffiti Rock Challenge was
opened by the punk—metal four

j piece, ReJX.

‘The bassist and lead singer was

band, decked out in sunglasses and
a “Macho Man” Randy Savage t-
shirt, and shouting claims of his
band being the “Ayatollah of rock
and ro1lah!” His wild playing and
jumping around made the band’s set
something interesting to watch. But
it wasn’t until their mascot came on
stage that the ReJX’s stage presen-
tation took off.

interacting with the
band, the crowd and
equipment. On his
first appearance, he was
joined by a cheerleader in a.
dark uniform brandishing two
small, souvenir, foam hands like
you’d buy at a football game. But it‘
was Nerdball — as he is called
accordingto the band’s Web site -
that made the impression. _
And these characters were a
welcome diversion —'— for both the
audience and the band —when one
of the band’s guitars fell victim to a

technical problem that rendered it

useless for nearly half their set.
But after a few appearances,
you start to wonder if this guy is

onstage to take the attention off of
the actual performance. The ReJX
is not a bad band by any means. The
guitar playing by the lead guitar
was inspired, going from straight

guitar work to blistering metal riffs

with ease. The drumming was
equally impressive.__ '

cal quality

lyrics over the too—loud guitars and
through the screaming of the lead
singer. When lyrics were under-
standable, though, they weren’t
very impressive.

Luckily, Nerdball made regular
appearances. At least the audience
could watch that enthusiastic odd-
ball run around on stage while lis-
tening to the ReJX’s awesome gui-
tar work.

After the 35-minute ReJX set,
band number two took to the stage.
Everybody Wins, another‘ four
piece, was a noticeably older group
— the bassist at one point thanked
his young students for coming out
to watch him perform — that came
on stage in suits. But these guys
weren’t the Beatles. Instead, they
were more like that really talented
band that can never quite"make the

  
 
       
   
          
 
     
  
 
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

big time that comes to play for the
high school prom.

Their set was a frustrating one.
The lead singer’s voice was‘inter—
esting, with a sort of quivering

raspiness that stood out

as the most original of
the night. Similarly,
there were ﬂashes
of interesting gui-

tar work from
the lead guitar
and decent
enough drum-
ming. But
their set
was, more
0 f t e 11
than not,

same
0 l d
thing.
Their
sound was pol-
ished and clean, but
all too familiar for fans of
mainstream rock. If you were to
close your eyes while listening to it,
you’d swear you were in one of
those John Cusack movies from the
‘80s, where he would sit around,
listening to the radio, brooding
about the girl he can’t have.
Everybody Wins could have provid-
ed the soundtrack to those movies.
Making things worse, when the
disco ball in the theater was lit up
during their set, that feeling of

‘being at a high school dance

became overwhelming.

But none of that is meant to
imply Everybody Wins was a terri-
ble act. On the contrary. There were
a lot of good sounds coming from
them, both lyrically and musically,
and they had a maturity that helped
them through the set. At one point,
technical problems caused an awful
lot of feedback to come from the
lead singer’s monitor. After a slight
derailment, they picked up the
pieces and made a decent rebound,
playing their two best songs at the
end of the set. ‘

By the end of their set, the
crowd had increased nicely and
everyone in the al1—ages area of the
theater was beginning to get into
the unfamiliar sound of this new—to—
them band.

THE PITT NEWS

“Salk” misses key moments

Undoing Salk

Through Feb. 22

Starring Jarrod DiGiorgi, Albert
Sabin

Directed by Robert Benedetti
Pittsburgh Playhouse Repertory
Company

(412) 621-4445

std‘:

In the 1950s, Jonas Salk developed
a polio "vaccine that saved an entire
generation. It was such a success that
polio is a muted issue in our world
today, and decreases in danger as the
years go by.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse
Repertory Company attempts to bring
the story of Salk and his groundbreak-
ing work to the stage in a new play by
Robert Benedetti. The 90-minute show,
“Undoing Salli,” spans 10 years of
Salk’s life. and shows that his journey to
the cure was full of’ drama and hard-
ships.

Salk’s determination in his work on

i the vaccine contrasts with his lack of

dedication toward his wife and chil-
dren. His relationship with his family is
the most interesting part of the story,
and unfortunately, Benedetti keeps us

_out of the home too much. Most of the

play’s attention focuses on Salk’s work
in the lab, and fails to ever directly con-
nect with the hearts of the audience.
The concept for the show is a
daunting one because, in all honesty, a
play based on the history of polio is not
exactly thrilling materialf There is an
overwhelming amount of scientiﬁc jar-
gon thrown around in the script, and
this is what ultimately holds back the
production. ‘ ~
The intimate theater is the perfect
place to perform a work of this nature,
but the bare-bones set provides very lit-
tle to hold your attention. Two‘ screens
on the back wall provide the most
entertainment, with stills and Video
clips of events‘/from the era, but it’s not
enough. However, there are a few
encouraging moments in the play.
' The rather large cast for such a
small play is full of exceptional actors.

‘Jarrod DiGiorgi’s portrayal _of Salk is as

exciting as one can be with a lifeless
script. The same can be said for the tal-
ented Martin Giles, playing Salk’s
rival, Albert Sabin. The two men feed
off of each other, and their energy

keeps the show from falling apart.
“Undoing Salk” somehow manages
to move at a quick pace and never gives
you a moment to collect your thoughts.
The amount of information on Salk that
is crammed into an hour and a half is
mind—numbing, and before you know it,
an entire decade of his life has gone by.
The play will certainly educate you
on the life of a fallen hero, but with the
excessive scientific lingo and overall
lack of entertainment, it will probably
leave you feeling as if you just spent
the night at the library instead of the
theater. , , _

SOUTH BEND, Ind. —- With the game on the
line, it was the seniors, who had never won. at
Notre Dame, who made all the difference in
Pitt’s 66-58 win over the Fighting Irish.

fifth three—pointer of the game to pull Notre .-

Dame to within four, Julius Page took a pass
from Yuri Demetris. Page faded to the corner
where he was wide open for the three-point shot.
He aimed and fired the bal.l right through the net
to put Pitt up 59-52 with 2:32 remaining in the
game. ,
With 58 seconds left in the game, the Irish

The final score does not reflect the way’ the

game started out. Notre Dame (10-9, 4-5)

After a minute and a half of no scoring by

SOUTH ‘BEND, Ind. — One play defined Pitt’s
66-58 win over Notre Dame Saturday. One play
twisted the knifeggin the Irish’s heart and sealed the
first’ victory for’Pitt in South Bend since 1998. That
play was a simple three-pointer by Julius Page.

With three minutes left in the game, Chris
Thomas did -what Pitt fans saw him do seven times
in Pittsburgh —— hit a three-pointer. The shot cut the
Panthers lead to 56-52. The Joyce Center crowd
rose to its feet, as the Irish were within striking dis-
tance of the No. 4 Panthers.

Carl Krauser dribbled the ball frontcourt and

passed to Yuri Demetris at the top of the key.

Demetris, who was only in the game because of
Jaron Brown’s foul troubles, threw a solid bounce
pass to Page in theright corner of the court. With
no hesitation, Page took the shot, and hit nothing
but the bottom of the net. He answered Thomas’

three-pointer with one of his own, putting Pitt on
top 59-52 and sealing the Panthers’ season sweep

‘ of the Irish.

. “I shot it with confidence, and I knew it was
going down,” Page said “The guy that was guard-
ing me was staying on top of the screen, so I stayed
in the corner, and I was open, so I just took the
shot.”

In one shot, Page spoke out loud for a senior
class and a team that had seen the Holy Ghost at
Notre Dame. The class with ‘the most wins ever in
Pitt basketball history had finally defeated the Irish
on its home court. 2

The biggest weapon Notre Dame presented to
Pitt was its three-point shooting ability. In the first
half the Irish started the game on a 15-2 run which
included three three-pointers by Thomas. Overall,
Notre Dame used six threes in the first half to gain
a six-point halftime lead.

“Over the last couple of years they always get
off to an excellent start by hitting a lot of threes,”

lps Pitt hold off Fighting Irish

Krauser said. “We just knew that if we kept our
composure, followed the seniors, kept our young
players in the game, and locked down on defense,
then we’d be alright.”

The second half was a different story.

Pitt started the second half on a 17-4 run to take
its first lead of the game. During the stretch, Notre
Dame’s weapon from the first half fell silent. The
Irish missed four shots from beyond the arc during
the Panthers run and didn’t hit a three until there
were only seven minutes remaining in the game.

After hitting 46.2 percent from the three-point
line in the first half, Notre Dame hit only two of 10
threes in the second half. Meanwhile, Pitt hit four
second half three-pointers, two from Krauser, one
from Brown and the biggest shot of the game from
Page. W -

“The key play of the game was Julius’ three,”
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “Yuri [Demetris]
made an unbelievable bounce pass, and the play
had perfect execution.”

could swim today-to relax us before

was kind of depressing swimming
his last meet, “but at the same time,
I’m moving on to new parts of my

\

life.”

“I’ve had lot’s of good times,”
said senior Sarah Grant whose moth-
er came from California to see the
meet, “I’m going to miss it so much,
but everybody’s having fun, swim-
ming well and getting ready for the
Big East Championship. That’s been
our goal the entire season.”

The Big East Championships are
February 19-21 at Long Island, N.Y.
The women look to improve on their
fifth-place finishes the past two
years, while the men want to contin-
ue their dominance with an eighth
consecutive title.

the ball into the hands of Carl
Krauser, who did not hesitate to
send a three-point shot of his own
through the basket.

After a missed layup by
Cornette, Page drove through the
lane and laid the ball in off the
glass. V

Notre Dame missed another
three-pointer and Pitt center Toree
Morris rebounded the ball and
passed it back to guard Jaron
Brown. Brown drove through the
lane and made a running jump shot
to cut the Irish lead to 15-9.

Notre Dame extended its lead
back to 10 points again with’7:20
left in the first half, but the Irish
lead would diminish from then on.

Pitt battled to cut the Irish lead
to 32-26 at halftime. .

“To play the way we did in the
first half and only beidown six
points, we knew that once we got it
going they couldn’t stop us,” Page

said.

Out of the half, the Panthers
went on a 17-4 run to give them a
43-36 lead.

Krauser start_ed the run when he
hit a layup 23 seconds into the sec-
ond half. .

After two free throws by Brown,

“Krauser crashed towards the basket,

jumped into the air as if he was
going to lay the ball in, but at the
last second he dished the ball to his
right to Troutman, who put the ball
in off the glass.

On the next Irish possession,
Thomas attempted another three-

pointer and again missed, allowing
Pitt to_ run the court. Troutman con-
trolled the ball down low and opted
to pass out to Krauser, who was
standing outside the three-point arc.
Krauser aimed, fired and watched
the ball swish through, as he threw
his crossed arms up, pounding them
together.

The basket gave Pitt its first
lead of the game, 35-34. After each
team exchanged two—point plays,

‘the Panther he1d'a 37-36 lead and

never looked back.
The Panthers built a 10-point
lead, 51-41, after Antonio Graves

I passed. the ball underneathto for-

ward Chris Taft. Taft turned and

banked a’ jump shot off the glass.

The Panthers finished the game
with three players in double-digit
scoring. Krauser led the way with
19 points and six rebounds.

Thomas led all scorers with 23
points, but just like the last time
these two teams met, it was not
enough to get past the No. 4
Panthers.

The Panthers are back in action
tonight at Seton Hall, where they
look to avenge last year’s 73-61
roadloss to the Pirates.
