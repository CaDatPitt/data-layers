Quartets Place
Titles on Block

Olsenmen Defend Four
Crowns at Philadelphia
In Penn Relay Races

By Ben Foote

Witli the greatest two year
record in the history of the tra-
ditional Penn Relays behind it,
the lfniversity of Pittsburgh
track team seeks clorm'.nati.o11 of
the carnival for the third
straight year as they defend four
titles in the 46th running of the
event tomorrow at historic Frank-
lin Field in Philadelphia.

The squad puts four titles on the
block: the mile sprint medley, the
440 yard sprint relay, the 880 yard
sprint relay, an.d the one mile relay.
The Panthers copped first place in
the latter three in 1938 and won

the sprint medley in 1938, making.

a total of eight triumphs in three
years. Only important member of
the cast that ﬁgured in the 1938 and
1939 sweeps and fails to return is
John Woodruff, C39, Olympic half
mile title holder.

Today the Panthers must first de-
fend the 440 yard trophy. Frank
Ohl and Larry Tregoning remain

. from the foursome that captured

the title last year while the sensa-
tional sophomore sprint twins, Hap
E.‘-tickel and Bullet Bill Carter ﬁll
the other two posts. With this
quartet, the locals are odds-on fa-
vorites to recapture the cup and
may set a new record.

Woodruff’s departure puts the
mile sprint medley title in jeopardy,
for Del Anderson makes his first
major start in the place of the for-
mer captain, running the half-mile
anchor leg. A new cup will be put
up, for last year’s combination re-
tired the Thomas Gates award. Late
lhis afternoon dependable Ohl ﬁlls

slot followed ybygstickelpand Tre-

Socialist Leader Thomas

Speaks at Hotel Schenley

Norman Thomas, Socialist Candi-
date for president, will speak to a
student peace meeting at Hotel
Schenley on Monday afternoon at
3:30 o’clock, according. to Alvin Ma-
laoff, C40, chairman of the commit-
tee in charge.

Although the subject of his
speech has not yet been announced
it is expected that he will discuss
the isolationist position in American
foreign affairs today.

The meeting arranged through
the courtesy of the Women’s Inter-
national League for Peace and Free-
dom, will be open to all University
students and to students of other
local colleges. ’

Thomas has spoken to University
audiences several times. The last
time he was here was four years
ago when he addressed a combined
group of students from all local col-
leges and universities.

He has spoken at Community
Forum every year for the last four
years; this fall he debated the hot-
ly—disputed neutrality act with
Robert Allen, Westmoreland Coun-
ty Congressman.

Thomas is well known on campi
all over the country. He is an active
participant in the regular April
“peace strikes,” speaking last week
at the strike held at Harvard.

A strong isolationist, he has been
an outspoken critic of any attempt
to change the status of American
neutrality, thus aligning himself
with Senator Champ Clark, the late
Senator Borah, and others of that
bloc in the international affairs of
the country. '

Alumni Trustee-:
A Complicated Case

The status of alumni representation on the Board of Trustees
is an issue which has become badly confused since a proposal for al-
tering the systeni of nominating alumni trustees was in effect re-
jected by Alumni Council this week.

At the present time. the (‘reneral .Associat_ion is proceeding with
plans to elect 11'} nominees to the Board of Trustees. The alumni are
following‘ the method used in 1937 and 1939. in accord with the ar-
rangement made when former Governor Earle intervened in the
alumni.-trustee situation. —

The method which the General Alumni Association  using for
selecting nominees to the Board of Trustees involves the election of
13 candidates by the alumni. Names of these nominees will be cer-
tified to the Board. In 1937 and 19339, nomination by the Alumni
Association had been tantamount to election by the Board of
Trustees.

' -ifnder the new proposal of the iiominating committee of the

-}oa'.'rd, Wliiclrwas presented to Alumni Council by Cl1a1icel.lor John
G."Bown1an two weeks ago and not accepted by the Council. this
weelz, the Alumni Association would lose the position of having; their
entire group at tliie alumni nominees elected to the Board. The new
proposal would have provided for the election of ,a panel of 80 nom-
inees by the various school groups. The Board of Trustees could
select new inenibers frotn this panel of 30 at will as vacancies oc-
curretl.  I ,

.. tlnherent in the new proposal was the idea that alumni trustees,
on'c‘e chosen to the Board, could be re-elected as alumni trustees.
Aliiiniii Association spokesmen have declared that this provision
would l.1a’ve removed from the alumni the right to determine whether
the present trustees could continue to represent them.

,One‘o,t’ the reasons for the proposal of the new plan, according
to the noniinating- committee of the Board, was a legal point; Uni-
ver~sit‘y solicitors have declared that. the method of 1101‘11i11all011 Of
alu'inni trustees used in 1937 and 1939 was illegal in that it forced
.tl.1e lloard to tlcllegate its responsibility in elec'ting' new trustees;
this means that the trustees may not accept alumni nominations 
elections to the Board, as they did in .1937 and lilijlfl.

ii Now that the new proposal of the noininating (::o;in1.n.ittee of
the Board has been turned down by the alumni for this  elec-
tion',_.an apparent impasse has been reached. It is true that’ the
Aluinni Council has authorized the appointment of a coin1nitt.ee to
discuss a revision of the trustee nomination with a :~:i1n:ila.r connnit'—
tee of the Board of Triistees, but it was clearly indicated that this
action would not affect the selection of the group of alumni trustees
this spring.

In the meantime, the teiieral Associatio11’s election. for nominees
to the Board of Trustees is being planned. lfnless another proposal
comes from the trustees, the alumni will probably certify the names
of nominees to the Board in time for the election of trustees on June
11. No statement has been made as to wlictlier the .l‘.ii>tl‘l"(l will ac-
cept’ or reject the alumni nominees. .

4, , i’ any action on thisiinpasse is to be taken, the next step is
p_ro:b’ably—up tothe Board of Trustees.

see,=-the unidentiﬁed entity can talk
toypleople without, them being on
guard against being quoted. Then
too, there is the problem of the
readers themselves. It is unfair
to be condemned. but readers often
confuse the personality of the writer
‘with what he has to say, thus de-
tracting from the value of anything
that? he might try to tell them.
Then, there is the uncomfortable
predicament of accumulating en-

The na“~ay Politic Dr. Geise Dedicates Text to Students

By S. F. Ayers

The bawdy politic has moved to
the other side of the tracks.

Conﬁned until recently to Uni-
versity campus environs. the exub-
erance of campus politics has now
emigrated with vengeance to the
halls ofthe Carnegie Institute of
Technology, which is also locat-ed
in the Oakland district.

According to dispatches emanat-
ing from informed circles, the
across-the—,border battle ﬂared up
last Tuesday when a blitzkrieg of
the Tech student paper, the Tartan,
precipitated statements, black eyes,
and pu-blicity.

War Communique

The informed circles reveal that
the fraternity group hijacked an is-
sue of the Tartan so that alleged in-
sinuations on double voting would
not revealed to the student voting
public. The Tartan, exponent of the
so—called Independent bloc, counter-
attacked with a replate issue, dis-
tributed to the campus by Inde-
pendent stalwarts.

A last minute communique from
Fraternity staff quarters in an
abandoned cellar on Forbes Street,
transmitted via neutral, but wor-
ried, circles reveals that the Big
Three Fraternity Party will publish
their version of the affair in time
for Tuesday’s election. which are
expected to be bitterly disputed,
verbally, physically and mentally.
Campus Significance

-Signiﬁcance of this scrambled po-
litical situation lies in the fact that
it is the first lndependent—Frater-
nilty fracas in four years for which
Jack Hoevcler, Jim Kennedy, Karl

tark, and Sam Whiteman have not

"issued statements.

There is no truth to the rumor

that Hoeveler-le'l flying squads will
try to vote Independent at the
Tech elections.

Fifty-four black and white line
maps drawn by Dr. John J. Geise,
associate professor of history, are
included in his new 1,100—page his-
to;y survey textbook, “Man and the
Western World,” published recently
by Harcourt, Brace and company,
New York.

Dedicated to his students, _the
book is written in two editions, one
:1 single volume edition, the other
in two separate volumes, for the
convenience of students taking only
one semester of the freshman sur-
vey history course in which the
book will be used.

At the head of each chapter is a
cut—line depicting an outstanding
individual in the period which the
chapter discusses. These pictures
were drawn by Henry Gute of the
Yale School of Art. About 128
photograph illustrations are grouped
in units of four pages with a page
of captions.

The book, which will be first used
in his summer school course this
year, was startedthree years ago
and was developed from his class
lectures. It follows the outline of

the syllabus which he also wrote for
“Man

his freshman history course.

substituted for both the syllabus
and Harry Elmer Barnes “History
of Western Civilization,” that were
used previously.

The last chapter titled “Between
Two Wars” covers the period be-
tween 1918 to January 1, 1940 and

discusses events leading up to the
present war in Europe.

This is the ﬁrst large book Dr.
Geise has written. Dr. Geise re-
marked that he feels’ he has learned
enough in writing this book to write
another, but at present he just
wants to rest.

Battle for Mile

All week long, candidates for the

team that defends the mile toga and
record of 3:14.8 have waged a great
battlefor slots. The mile crown,
the most cherished on the program,
was taken. last year, after Ohl ran
a brilliant 47.9 quarter, and Al Fer-
rara, Bud Graf, and Woodruff

stayed--15 yards ahead of the pack

to give Pitt the title and the record.

The abundance of star 440 mater-
ial caused Olson. to enter a team in
a class B mile event as well as in
the class A. Tregoning, Al Bou-

up the outﬁt that any other coach
would give his right arm to have as
No. 1 team.

Niiie Individual Events

For the first time a shuttle hurdle
relay quartet will represent the
University at Philadelphia. Senior
Bob Sulkowski, junior Joe New-
man and sopromores Len Powell and
Bill Cooper are Olson’s choices for
the 480 yard high timber bunch.

Not since Gene Taano and Walt
Good won individual titles in 1936
has a Pitt man come out on top. En-
trants in nine different individual
competitions‘ wear the Blue and

Stickel and Carter make another at-

Newman seeks a watch in the 120

‘First’ Squad

If. Ohio State thinks it has a push-
over in the Pitt varsty eleven on
next September 30, it had better
take a second look at the second
stringers that Coach Bowser has
on hand.,

On Tuesday the varsity playeda
regulation game against the so-
called second team and ended up on
the lower end of a 9-6 score.

Ernie_Bonel1i, playing right-half
for the scrubs,’ punctured a hole

'through the varsity line from the
‘three and went over for the first

score of the game.

Before the score-keeper had a
chance to sit down after hanging
up the seven, the yanniganstailed
two more points when Bob. Thur-
bon fumbled the ensuing kickoff
over the goal line for a safety.

Late in the second half, the var-
sity showed some sign of life as they
marched from mid-ﬁeld to pay dirt.
However, the subs made things diffi-
cult and it took Bowser’s first team
four downs to score after having
first down and goal to go on the
seven yard line. Kracum smashed
over from the one foot line on the
fourth try.

Tomorrow afternoon, the varsity
is planning a surprise party for the
under-pups in a return game.

Johnson May Handle
Slab Job for _Today’s
Skirmish with Indiana

For the second time within a
week Pittsburgh baseball fans will
see an opening game. This time the
important role of host will be play-
ed by the University of Pittsburgh
nine when they meet the Indiana
State Teachers tonforrow on the
Stadium diamond at 3:15 o’clock.

In their meeting last year, the
Panthers defeated the Teachers by
a :3-4 count for one of the three
wins the Pitt nine registered. The
Indiana State squad may upset Pitt
hopes to make it two in a row, for

they are reputed to hav_e one of

their best teams in recentyears.
According to Coach lvlitterling the
pitching assignment will be given
to either southpaw Andy Johnson
or newcomer Ben Kish. Regard-
less of who draws the nod, however,

the other will be sure to see action,_

Mitterling said.

Except for footballer Eddie Jones
the entire Pitt squad is in perfect
condition physically. Jones is still
troubled by an elbow injury which
he received earlier in the season,
but Mitterling may use him in the
outﬁeld. '

The other half of the battery will
be “Gabby” Hartman who handled
the job on the Southern trip. In
reserve the Panthers have both
Guadagnino and Goodell.

Although the Indiana Teachers
have as yet not played, they are
reported to have a well—balanced

Jim Kennedy, by virtue of his win
in the match with Penn_St_ate last
week, has moved from the sixth to
the second slot on the Pitt golf team
for today’s match with Carnegie
Tech.

Bill Kramer continues to hold
down the number one position and
Seybold is down to three. Bill
Reilly’s fourth, Homer McClintock
fifth, and Larry Geyer completes
the team in the sixth position. ‘

Pitt will be trying for a comeback
after losing to Penn State last week,
6-3. The best they could do then
was one win, a tie, and a best ball.

the State nine will meet the newly
formed Duquesne team. .

.Following the Indiana game, the
Panthers will open a two game ser-
ies with the West Virginia Moun-
taineers at the Stadium. Thus far
this season the West Virginians
have won two of their three games
played.

Chief bulwarks in the West Vir-
ginia offense are Lou Sloman, vet-
eran second sacker, and Hal Cross-
man, speedy shortstop. The former
has recorded a .556 batting average
and the latter is swinging at an

Undefeated Sigma Alpha Mu,

seem determned to retain their
crown as they enter today’s contest

Lou Mendlow, SAM satellite,
lived up to all advance notices ‘by
