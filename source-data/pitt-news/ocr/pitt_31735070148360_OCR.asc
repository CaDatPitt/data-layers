When tailback Ray Graham injured
his right knee and left the game on
Pitt’s ﬁrst drive Wednesday night,
the Panther offense could have shut
down. .

' Instead, quarterback Tino Sun-
seri and the passing game took
over.

the nation with 134.1 rushing yards
pergame, was carried off the ﬁeld
and carted to the locker room ear-
ly in the ﬁrst quarter. Graham has
been one of the few positives for the
Pitt offenseand his loss, potentially
for the season, is devastating to the
Panthers’ attack. I

But against the Huskies, Sunseri
guided the Panthers to a 35-20 win
over Connecticut at Heinz

Graham, who ranks second in

Field with a career—high 419 pass-
ing yards and two touchdowns on
29-42 passing.

Sunseri set the collegiate record
at Heinz Field for passing yards,
while also tying the fourth high-
est passing yard total in Pitt his-
tory. Rod Rutherford also threw for
419 yards against West Virginia in
2003.

“Whenever you lose a player like
Ray Graham, it hurts a lot,” Sunseri
said. “He’s a guy who’s in the locker
room, he’s a vocal leader and he’s
also one of the best backs in Amer-
ica. The way Ray is, hewanting to
make sure we kept looking forward,
kept on track and won this game.”

Ten days ago, Sunseri and
backup quarterback Trey Ander-
son combined to complete just nine
total passes for 40 yards.

Henry Kissinger reflects on political history

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Writer

As former Secretary of State

Henry Kissinger recounted the

steps that led up to his ﬁrst visit
to China, which took place in a
time when China had no diplo-
matic ties with the US, shouts
from an audience member,seat—
ed on the balcony interrupted
his remarks. I .13 L
“You don’t deserve a voice,”
the heckler shouted from the
audi_ence. ‘V I .
The voice faded and Ki.s_sing—
er turned to his old friend and
colleague, former Pennsylva-
nia governor and U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh,-and

said, “I certainly don’t,leave.

them indifferent.”

This type of dry wit has been
characteristic of Kissinger dur-
ing his long career in politics
and foreign policy. He demon-
strated this trait as the keynote
speaker Wednesday night at the
Carnegie Music Hall. He spoke
for the fourth ann_ual confer-
ence hosted by the Pittsburgh
Middle» East Institute’, Whose
goal is to promote ties between
the U.S. and the Middle East.
His lecture reflected on his
term as secretary of state and

his views on current foreign

affairs. .

In his hour-long lecture,
Kissinger discussed immigrat-
ing to the U.S. from Nazi Ger-

_ many’ in 1938 with his Jewish

family at the age of 15. He was
drafted into the U.S. Army dur-
ing World War II, which sent
him back to Europe where he
worked in military intelli-
gence.i

He also reflected on his in-
volvement in the Vietnam War
under former President Richard
Nixon and recollected the steps
that he and the Nixon adminis-
tration took to open relations
with communist China at a time
when such a relationship was
unheard of.

Nixon swore in Kissinger
as the 56th Secretary of State
in 1973, a position in which
Kissinger was famous for his
calculated decisions. '

best, but for the worst. And
there are some things you can-
not do even though you might
like to because the consequenc-

es of failure are too serious,”,

Kissinger said.

Kissinger also discussed the
recent changes in the politics of
the Middle East resulting from
the Arab Spring and how those
changes affect American inter-
ests. He said that in addition to
stability Within these countries,
he was concerned that the rap-
id political flux would make it
harder for Arab governments to
move toward peace with Israel,
a major U.S. ally in the region.

“Establishment of democ-

* racy by outsiders can become

very problematical,” he said.

“We saw it in Vietnam. We saw

it in Iraq. We’re experiencing it
now in Afghanistan.”

Kissinger also expressed his
concerns about the complexity
and unpredictability of future
events in the Middle East as the
Arab Spring progresses. While
groups with different motives
may come together to remove
a leader, Kissinger said that it
was another matter for them to
maintain order and establish
new leadership.

“One has to remember that
the excitement of the first few
months is the first scene of the
first act of a five-act drama,
and all of this exuberance of
our media at the beginning for-
got the history of revolution,”
Kissinger said.

Obama outlines plans to decreasestudent debt

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

The Obama administration has tak-
en actions that might make college
more aifordable, or at least make
student loan debt easier to bear.

President Barack Obama signed
three executive orders on Wednes-
day that seek to make college more
aifordable and make it easier for
students to repay their federal
student loans, with an end goal of
strengthening the economy. The
orders will not have to go through
Congress.

Obama announced the plan less‘

than two weeks after Congress re-
jected his Americanjobs Act, a $447
billion program meant to target
spending and alter the tax code to
increase revenue, and just one day
after premiering a national mort-
gage reﬁnancing plan. ’

In a speech touting the new
initiatives in Denver, Obama said
that college graduates who take out
loans leave college owing an average
of $24,000.

“Now, living with that kind of
debt means making some pretty
tough choices when you’re ﬁrst
starting out,” Obama said in Denver.
“It might mean putting off buying a
house. It might mean you can’t start
a business idea that you’ve got. It

may mean that you’ve got to wait
longer to start a family, or certainly
it means you’re putting of saving
for retirement because you’re still
paying off your student loans.”

Emphasizing the economic ben-
eﬁts of his new program has become
a running theme in the president’s
most high-proﬁle efforts over the
past few weeks. With not much eco-
nomic legislation coming out of a
divided Congress, Obama has now
turned to executive orders to try
and stimulate a struggling economy
while a tough re-election campaign
looms.

One of the main aspects of this
series of executive orders is the “Pay
As You Earn” plan, which allows
borrowers to cap their student loan
payments to 10 percent of their dis-
cretionary income.

In 2010, Obama enacted an in-
come-based repayment plan that
allowed borrowers to cap their
monthly student loan payments at
15 percent of their discretionary
income. The plan was set to reduce
the limit from 15 to 10 percent be-
ginning in 2014.

But Melody Barnes, the director
of the White House Domestic Policy
Council, said in a Wednesday con-
ference call that Obama “realized
students need relief sooner than
that,” so this proposal will take ef-
fect injanuary 2012.

There are currently 36 million

. borrowers, but only 450,000 of

them are participating in the cur-
rent program. Barnes is hoping
‘more people will take advantage
of the new program. She said it will
also have a signiﬁcant effecton col-
lege graduates who are currently
working to pay off their student
loans. - _ ff;;_ 0

She said these proposed changes
could reduce payments by hundreds
of dollars each month for more than
1.6 million student borrowers.

She said one major problem is
that debt levels discourage potential
students from going to college. Debt

’ also discourages college graduates

from entering lower-paying jobs
like teaching or other public service
careers because of high monthly
loan payments. A

Obama said the changes outlined
in his series of executive orders will
help young people ﬁgure out how
to afford college and will put more
money in their pocket when they
graduate.

“And because you’ll have some
certainty, knowing that it’s only a
certain percentage of your income
that is going to pay off your student
loans, that means you will be more
conﬁdent and comfortable to buy
a house or save for retirement,”
Obama said. “And that will give our
economy a boost at a time when it

desperately needs it. So this is not
just important to our country right
now, it’s important to our country’s
future.” '

Another part of the series will
help students manage their debt by
consolidating their student loans.
Currently, the separate payments
for loans, such as Stafford loans and
Direct loans, make borrowers more
likely to default, Barnes said.

Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan said during the call that the
administration has done everything
it can to help on the front end of
college affordability, including in-
creasing funding for Pell Grants, a
move separate from Obama’s three

‘executive orders.

S Duncan said that the greatest
increase in Pell Grants, which will
amount to $40 rn,illion,wi1l occur
within the next decade.

He said that it is now time to
help on the back end by reducing
loan repayments and consolidating
loans for students who have already
graduated, so that they can put that
money back in their pockets and
pay for things like rent and gro-
ceries.

The way to get America’s econo-
my back‘ on track is to “educate our
way to a better economy,” he said.

Raj Date, the special adviser to
the Secretary of the Treasury on the
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-

reau, noted another initiative that
will help students with loans before
‘they even come to college.

The “Know Before You Owe”
plan will create a one—page ﬁnancial
aid shopping sheet, which will make
it easier for students to compare
ﬁnancial aid offers from different in-
stitutions side by side. Right now the
sheet is a prototype, andvDaté said
they are waiting on student input’
before making a ﬁnal document.

On the sheet, college applicants
will be able to distinguish between
loans and scholarships, and the

sheet will also outline the ﬁill cost .

of attendance of college, the total
debt the student might incur and the
monthly payment for the loans. V

Date said during the conference
call that the ﬁnancial aid letters are
confusing right now because they
are full of jargon  students “can-
not easily determine how much debt
their takingon and how much debt
is too much.” . ‘

“We want to make sure the risks
are clear to students before they
take on that debt,” Date said.

Barnes said she realizes that col-
lege costs have. drastically increased
over the past few years, including
the costs of tuition, books and room
and board.“We know students can’t
wait, and that’s why we’re not wait-,

ing to make college more afford- -

able,” she said.

People protest Kissinger’s decision-making

Kissinger 4 1

He went on to stress that he
saw widely disparate groups
emerging and vying for leader-
ship in Egypt, Libya and other
Arab countries that are part of
the Arab Spring.

Outside the conference,
not everyone was enthusiastic
about Kissinger’s visit. Around
20 protesters carried signs
criticizing the PMEI for host-
ing the former statesman. Most
cited his handling of Vietnam
and bombing of Cambodia as
reasons for protesting.

Bob Ross, a professor of
global cultural studies at Point
Park University, said he was
skeptical about whether the
conference would really help
the Middle East.

Ross took issue with the title
of the second part ofthe confer-
ence, “Saudi ‘Arabia: Kingdom
of Opportunity.”

“It begs the question, oppor-
tunity for whom?” Ross said.

He said that Kissinger’s re-

cord as a diplomat and expert
on foreign policy has drawn
criticism, specifically regarding
his dealings with authoritarian
regimes.

“[Kissinger] has a lot of ex-
perience working with dictato-
rial regimes to create business
opportunities,” he said.

Malik Al-Hinai, who sat in
on the lecture, works in the
mayor’s office in Muscat, the
capital of Oman. He came to
Pittsburgh with the Omani del-
egation and said he was pleased
with Kissinger’s remarks.

Al—Hinai said he was opti-
mistic about the ties between
the Gulf country of Oman and
Pittsburgh. -

“It is very inspiring to see a
leader who has seen the past,”
Alhinai said, citing Kissinger’s

‘remarks on the need for cau-

tion among the next‘ generation
of leaders in the Middle East.
“That is exactly what we need
to hear.” j

Pitt students reﬂeet on Gadhaﬁ’s death

Kelly Lyons
Staﬁ” Writer

Pitt freshman Ali Aneizi’s parents fell
victim to C01. Moammar Gadhaﬁ’s
oppression 30 years ago when his
followers conﬁscated their houses
and belongings.

To escape the oppressive re-
gime, Aneizi’s parents separately
emigrated from Libya to the United
States and later met and married
on U.S. soil. ‘

The whole family let out a huge
sigh of relief on Oct. 20 when the
Libyan government declared Gad-
haﬁ dead.

Upon hearing the news of Gad-
haﬁ’s and his son Moatassim’s
deaths, many of Pitt’s Libyan stu-
dents expressed hope. Afterqa 42-
year dictatorship, they are eager to
watch their home country enter a
new era. Students with other! con-
nections to_ the Middle East are also
watching in anticipation as the -revo-
1ution’s impact expands into nearby
countries. V I  ~.

But students have mixeg1_feel—
ings about-how Gadhaﬁ waslﬁlled
in Sirte, Libya.

A cqntroversial video s

   

depicting a conscious Gadhaﬁ wip-
ing blood from the left side of his
face, with no indication having been
shot. Later videos show Gadhaﬁ
dead with a bullet hole in the same
spot andaLibyan rebelshoutingthat
he had killed Gadhaﬁ. The conﬂict-
ingvideos created skepticism about
the Libyan interim government’s an-
nouncement that Gadhaﬁ had died
accidentally during a shootout.

Aneizi and Pitt freshman Zaka.ri-
yya Elarbi said Gadhaﬁ’s death is a
reﬂection of the harsh treatment of
the Libyan people.

“Once I saw the videos, I was
happy. A lot of people died at his
hands,” Elarbi said.

Most of Elarbi’s family lives in
Libya. One of his uncles ﬂed Libya
because he was wanted by Gadhaﬁ.
His‘father and another uncle left
because they were forced to ﬁght

in the army for a government they
I . did not support. ' ‘
Senior Louie Al—Hashirni, who is ‘

the president of the Muslim Student
Association and of Syrian descent,
said that the videos were unsettling
to watch. . J  A‘
“It was brutal, to say the least,”
he said. “In Islam, we’re taught. to

hate what people do, notlpéeople-.

themselves.”

Al-Hashimi would have liked to
see the Libyan dictatorship collapse
the same way as Egypt’s. In Febru-
ary, Egyptian oﬁicials announced
that President Hosni Mubarak had
resigned. He’s currently facing trial
for allegations of being involved in
the killing of protesters.

The Libyan rebels’ capture of
Tripoli on Aug. 21 was part of the
dramatic revolutionary movement
in the Middle East known as the

“‘Arab Spring.” Al—Hashimi said

the revolution in Libya sends an
ominous sign to Syria’s president,
Bashar al—Assad.

“[Gadhaﬁ’s death] will serve to
inspire the young people who are
still ﬁghting against oppressive gov-
ernments,” Al—Hashimi said.

But because Syria has a more ad-
ept military that can offset regional
conﬂict, A1-Hashimi said that he is
worried about the lives of the Syr-
ians opposed to al—Assad.

As the Middle East faces historic

- change, Elarbi is-eager to experience

it ﬁrst-hand. He is visiting his family
this summer inlLibya.

“I hope byfgthe time I go this
summer, it  safe,” Elarbi said.

Don’t blame music

for drinking habits

Many teenagers, especially those
who listen to popular radio, can
list at least a half-dozen rapper—en-
dorsed brands of liquor. Thankfully
— despite what certain research-
ers might suggest — exposure to
these artists usually doesn’t lead
young audiences to engage in
drinking behavior.

A University of Pittsburgh-
Dartmouth study published last
Thursday found that during any
given hour of music listening,
American teens hear an average
of 3.4 references to brand-name al-
cohols. Some are “luxury” liquors
like Grey Goose, while others are
more modestly priced brands like
Smirnoff. Based on the results of a
recent survey, the authors specu-
late that it’s precisely these refer-
ences that cause underage drink-
ers to cite many of these brands as
their favorites.

Although it’s true that countless
popular singles —- particularly, the
authors point out, in the hip-hop
and R&B genres — encourage
drug use, we think it’s premature
to claim they play a pivotal role in
underage drinking. Music may be
one of the most visible catalysts for
bad behavior, but it’s certainly not
the most signiﬁcant.

First of all, it’s important to
note that the products champi-
oned by self-reported underage
drinkers in the aforementioned
survey are hardly exclusive to
hip—hop culture. According to a
2009 report by Drinks Interna-
tional magazine, Grey Goose is the
fourth most popular vodka in the
world, while Smirnoff, according

i to a 2008 Bloomberg News article,

is the most popular vodka in the

United States.

?

Furthermore, the reliability of
the survey itself should be called
into question. Because researchers
took underage drinkers at their
word, it’s impossible to gauge
how truthful they actually were.

These so-called “binge drinkers” -

might have been overstating their
misbehavior: Many might actu-
ally qualify as perfectly moderate
drinkers.

Finally, the “hip-hop/R&B”
mentality researchers single out as
especially harmful is hardly recent
or genre—speciﬁc. Many rock stars
popular in the 1960s and 1970s
were equally hedonistic; refer-
ences to alcohol and other drugs
abound in songs by The Rolling
Stones and The Stooges, among
others. If anything, these artists
were more inﬂuential than their
like-minded successors. Frank
Coleman, spokesman for the Dis-
tilled Spirits Council of the United
States, told ABC News that a 2010'

' University of Michigan study dem-

onstrated that binge drinking was
at an all-time low even as the popu-
larity of rap music spiked.

Many songs on the Billboard
charts do indeed promote dan-
gerous lifestyles — lifestyles that
more than a few young people
regard as desirable. However, as
multiple studies have shown, in-
nate behavioral traits are better
predictors of illicit behavior than
taste in music. Scold hip—hop and
R&B artists for their frequent mi-
sogyny or for their perpetuation of
stereotypes, but don’t make them
the scapegoats for a problem that
owes more to more subtle personal
conditions.

rue STAMATTACK  
Antisocial behavior, narcissism
increased by iPod use

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

You might be reading this in a hurry
between classes, stressed out about
how crazy your life is. Trust me, I
understand how unfair it is that
some professors take attendance.
But I hope that you’re not walk-
ing around with your nose inches
from the newsprint, absorbed in
your own special world because
you need some “rnetime.” First of

all, stressed power walking is not ,

the best way to enjoy an esteemed
college newspaper. Secondly, and
more importantly, our generation
already has an outlet for narcis-
sism and the need to get away: the
iPod.

This column might be coming
out about 10 years after it was ﬁrst

relevant, but considering that my’

music tastes’are about 40 years
behind and I missed my chance
to voice my opinions then, I can’t
be one to care about these kinds
of things. I will admit, at the very
least, that it’s passe to talk about
how technology is destroying
Ameri’ca’s youth.

But as someone who has recent-
ly forsaken the ways of the iPod -
mainly because I lost mine running
to catch a plane — I can’t help but
look at those of us who continue to
walk. around campus with earbuds

trailing from our ears with increas- ‘

ing disgust.

I’m not talking about the stu-
dent walking back into South Oak-
land after a long day, or the bus

‘passenger riding in from Squirrel

Hill in the morning. These private
periods are when we reﬂect and
plan anyway, and thinking to the
soundtrack from‘ “Mulan” or that
song from “The Hills” isn’t damag-
ing to anybody. Rather, it’s the hur-
ried iPod listeners that are trouble-
some —— the people who need to
throw them on in_ the 10-minute
frantic spurts around campus or
while walking down Forbes. Un-
less I’m-mistaken, we aren’t in a
war; I don’t think our classes are so
stressful that we have no choice but
to decompress every 10 minutes.
Furthermore, from a public

health perspective,

wearing an iPod when there’s a
possibility of getting hit by a rogue
PAT bus, cyclist or squirrel seems
irresponsible. There are dozens of
anecdotal stories on_the Internet

about people colliding with things _
because they weren’t paying atten-

tion. If you had asked those people
if anything bad could ever happen
to them before their accidents, I’m
sure they would say no.

Of course, in most cases, noth-
ing bad will happen. The caveman
brain that controls our instinctive
reﬂexes can function with the eyes
alone. But for the fast reactions that
save lives and prevent injuries —
like the quick dodge to get out of
the way of a bus or bike — it’s bet-
ter to hear something. Auditory
stimuli are easier for the brain to
process than visual stimuli, and
are thus better warnings than the
glimpse of a bike in your peripheral
vision. ‘

Maybe you don’t care about
your health. Like all college stu-
dents, I, too, know that nothing bad
can ever happen to me. But think
about this from a social perspec-
tive — think about all the awkward
incidents iPods cause.

It’s happened to all of us: You
see a friend —— or rather, a sup-
posed friend —— and wave, expect-
ing a friendly reciprocation. But
there isn’t any, for this friend of
yours is wearing an iPod, one that
you might not have seen. . .

Questions seize you: Did I just

Ben -Kaye I For The Pitt News

come across as a desperate freak?
Does this friend even like me? The
social anxiety is palpable.

The net result of all these en-
counters is that' eventually people

stop waving at each other. We all

collectively decide the warmth of
human conversation isn’t worth
the potential anxiety of an unre-
quited wave. Soon, we’ll live in a
cold world where coincidental
hellos are a thing of the past -—— if
they aren’t already. Just stare at the
masses moving through our public
places and you can see that I’m not
just complaining about nothing.
We really do look like the drones
our parents told us we would be-
come.

Now, I don’t pretend to be able
to deﬁne when walking with music
is acceptable and when it’s anti-
social and potentiallyldamaging.
Much like identifying pornography
from art, you just know it when you
see it. _

But until I come up with a sci-
entiﬁc deﬁnition, the next time you

ﬁnd yourself in a throng of people _

— be it walking around, in a class-
room, or in an elevator — consider
taking your headphones out. Try to
engage the world around you. Even
if you ﬁnd it gross and disgusting,
at least you’ll realize what you’ve
been missing. _

Also, I guarantee you the rest of
the elevator does not want to hear
that Miley Cyrus song blaring from
your earbuds. |

COLUMN

For women, there’s no such
thing as casual sex

Courtney Strauss
Columnist

Many women of our generation,
raised on shows like “Entourage”
and “Sex and the City,” have be-
come unconsciously conditioned
to a life of singledom. Now, unfor-
tunately, we’ve allowed marriage to
become obsolete and casual sex to
mess with our heads.

According to a 2010 Pew Re-

A search Center study, 39 percent of

surveyed adults believe marriage

is becoming obsolete. A largepor- -

tion of young people might cel-

* ebrate this development. The logic
_ goes that, given the diminishing

chances of having a successﬁil ﬁrst
marriage, why not just make ev-
erything once associated with the
traditional family casual? We could
avoid messy and time-consuming
divorces and the p_ain of inﬁdelity.

_ Believing we’re smarter than our

parents, we emotionally detach
ourselves from these antiquated
problems and instead focus our
energies on a career, social‘net-
wo rking, mastering the yoga crow

pose and baking vegan oatmeal
, cookies — all so we don’t have to

deal with real pain.
Unfortunately, we’ve compro-
mised ourselves in this binge of
tradition-breaking, and we’re
allowing our carefree attitudes
about love to turn us into dam-

aged lovers. Casual sex —_ that is, ‘

intercourse with no pre-existing‘
emotional commitment to one’s
partner — ‘is unhealthy for wom-
en. A woman’s orgasm releases
oxytocin, the “cuddle hormone,”
which allows us to feel a sense of
attachment to our partner. But if

there’s nothing to attach to — no
meaningful emotional connec-
tion —— we’re left feeling regret-
ful and empty after the orgasm.

V (Psychologists have also identiﬁed

these feelings less prevalently in
males, who release smaller doses
of the hormone). Compartmental—
izing sex and emotion is difficult
for us because our orgasms have
a lot to do with the mind. As New
York Times contributor Richard A.
Friedman wrote in a 200.9 edito-
rial, “The truth is that the most

We've allowed P

marriage to become

obsolete and casual,

sex to mess with

our heads.

—,—_.“",’y""““

important sexual organ of humans
is actually the brain.” Sex may be a
physical act, but depression, which
you might feel afterward, can be
physical as well. '
Sex therapist Ian Kerner, Ph.D.,
shared similar ' concerns on his

MSNBC page. “We can treat sex_

lightly,” he said, “but sex doesn’t
always treat us lightly back in re-
turn.” ‘ I
Although women gained the
right to vote in 1920 and are work-

ing steadily toward being perceived
as equal in all spheres of society,
there remain ﬁmdamental gender
distinctions that we need to ac-
knowledge. The fact of the matter
is that sex is fun for us in large part
because it entails emotional attach-
ment (insert male scoffs here).]ust

as fruits and vegetables require dif-—

ferent ingredients to enhance their
ﬂavor, women and men require dif-

— ferent degrees of attachment to

enhance their experience.

Doris Lessing addresses this
problem in her 1962 novel “The
Golden Notebook”: “Free, we say,
yet the truth is they geterections
when they’re with a woman they
don’t give a damn about, but we
don’t have an orgasm unless we love
him. What’s free about that?”

Carrying on casual relation-
ships with men is like third-wave

feminists asking for all—male at-’

tributes. We can’t forget that men
and women are different sexes
that, biologically, require different
things.»It’s not logical for women to
ask for a chemical change so we can
have sex with the same mindset as
a man. It’s not fair to us to succumb
to ‘a man’s casual desires either,
especially when it’s detrimental to
our emotions. Casual sex is not the
answer, even in today’s commit-
ment-phobic world. Let’s look to
marriages like Michelle and Barack
Obama’s, or even Sharon and Qzzy
Osbourne’s, for inspiration.

Of course, if my dream lover

came along today, I wouldn’t marry_

him anyway — at least not until
Ricky Martin or Adam Lambert
can walk down the aisle in all 50
states. But that’s a story for an-
other time. I

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

Mark Kozlowski’s Oct. 24 column,
“Capitalism still the most desirable
economic system,” is ﬁlled with inac-
curacies anduntruths. The piece brings
nothingnewinthe attemptto discredit
socialism Hisarguments have been re-
peated time and time again, and there
is no shortage of material available that
reﬁiteshis many hollow claims. _

Kozlowski references these stale
discredited arguments in an attempt
to demonstrate the failure of social-
ism, yet makes no attempts to seri-
ously consider or address the failure
of capitalism.

Just last week, ﬁgures published
bythe Social SecurityAdrninistration
revealed thata majority ofAmericans
eamnear-povertywages. The median
incomefor2o10 was $26,364, hardly

greater than the official poverty level,

of $22,025 for a family of four.
The anti-capitalist sentiments of
the Occupy Wall ‘Street movement

are not the result of some misunder-
standing of capitalism, as Kozlowski
 They are the result of an un-
derstandingthat capitalism has failed:
the realization that a system in which
so many face poverty and devastation
is ﬂawed.

The solution to these problems is
a system thatworks in the interests of
the whole of society, not for the proﬁts
of a narrow rulingclass. This requires

A thatfactories andbusinessesbeplaced‘
under the democratic control of the

working class, and a guarantee ofba-
sic social rights such as the right to
a well—paying job, quality education,
health care and housing. This is the
program of socialism, the alternative
to the capitalist system of overwhelm-
ing poverty and exploitation.

Sincerely,

To the Editor,

It is with a great deal of sadness
that I have watched The Pitt News
take such a dramatic lurch to the
right, a shift shown most obviously
in the unfair and ignorant article
written by Mr. Kozlowski in his
Oct. 24 column, “Capitalism still
the most desirable economic sys-
tem.” While I support capitalism
and agree that it seems to be the
best humanly possible economic
system, Mr. Kozlowski, as usual,
writes an article that shows just how
sadly the right has lost its grip on
reality. While I am limited to 250
words, I would like to point out
that the U.S. has one of the high-

est levels of income inequality in ’

the ﬁrst world and is one of the
only first world nations to become
more unequal since 1980. Europe
(particularly central Europe-and
Scandinavia), by providing quality
education and a fair, progressive tax

system, has avoided this problem
and has far more social mobility
than the U.S. through its “socialist”
policies. In addition, Mr. Kozlowski
claims that the banks were “encour-
aged” to behave riskily because they
assumed the government would
protect them, a patently false state-
ment. The banks made risky loans
because of lax regulations created
by the Bush and Clinton administra-
tions, the ultimate example of the
excesses that “laissez-faire”-style
capitalism encourages, a style that
Mr. Kozlowski seems to support.
There, of course, remains more to
be said — especially in regard to
his points on the recent problems
in Europe —— therefore, I urge stu-
dents _on campus to step forward
and stop articles like this from go-
ing unchallenged.

Sincerely,
Luke Neal

in the heat ofthe paintball gridiron. Feeling
a little cooped up as of late, I decided to strap

that it was the home of Pitt’s paintball team,

a Sunday afternoon. A
After looking online for advice, I came
prepared with a light hooded sweatshirt and
a pair of loose jeans that I wouldn’t be too
angry about staining. A pair of sneakers you

liability waiver form that I found on their
website.  '  "

From zombie video games to zombie-

“The Walking) Dead” season-two pre-

cording to the AMC network. This is a stag-
gering ﬁgure in comparison to AMC’s two
other crown" jewels, “Breaking Bad” and
“Mad Men,” whose most recent»-premieres.
only pulled 2.58 and 2.92 million viewers,
respectively. 

Based on the 2003 graphic novel series 2

written by Robert Kirkman and illustrated

by Tony Moore, “The WalkinglDead”‘cen- V "

The ﬁrst season ended by dramatically
revealing humanity’s bleak situation, while

the group’s leader, Rick Grimes (Andrew
Lincoln), reﬂects on his decision to go to
the Centers for Disease Control and the
“slim chances” his group now faces.

continue to display many of the strengths

ing, but itgseems that the band is willing to
adapt to new trends in music. ' ‘
The second single, “Paradise,” further

proves that Coldplay is‘ moving in a new ’

direction. In a surprising move, it seems
that Coldplay has chosen to make a song
better suited for a club or a bar than a re-
laxing Sunday drive. Nothing could better
prove this than the repetitive bassline, which
sounds more like house music than anything

I Coldplay has ever done before. But the old

volleyball team’s conﬁdence is high.
With a game against the conference’s
leaderfast approaching, the Panthers
will look to build on that momentum
this weekend.

“By beating the No. 2 team in the

Big East, we have proven to ourselves .
’ and the rest of the conference that
' we can beat anyone,” senior middle

blocker Kiesha Leggs said. “It gives us
a sense of conﬁdence going forward
with the rest of the season.”

The Panthers were able to rebound

‘ from a 0-3 loss to Cincinnati last Sat-

urday to earn a 3-1 victory over the
Louisville Cardinals the next day.
“Thewinagainst Louisville showed

coach Toby Rens said after the victory.

- “Hopefully thatmomentumwillcarry

The lasting effects of the Louis-
ville match will be put to the test this
comingweekend as the Panthers (14-

Syracuse and Marquette.

Syracuse (15-8, 4-3) currently sits

fense,”'Rens said. “Our offense will.

have to be very efﬁcien ”

Leggs has been a major contribu-
torto that offense, as she led the team
with 24 killsagainst Louisville.

. In addition to Leggs’ success, the
return of freshman outside hitterjes-
sicawynnwas an offensivesparkthis
past weekend.

After battling her way back from
an injury, Wynn earned her ﬁrst start
since September against Cincinnati
and led all players with 12 kills, a ca-
reerhigh.

“It is hard just watching from the
bench so I was glad to get back into
the game,” Wynn said. “I am looking
forward to playing Syracuse and Mar-

A quette and continuing to improve.”

f Rens agreed and added that even
though she’s a freshman, Wynn adds
more than statistics ‘to the Pitt team.

“Jessicahas a positive attitude that
brings a lot of energy on the court,”

.Rens said. “That presence is essential

in maintaining conﬁdence and mo-
mentum throughout a mate .”

‘ Such momentum and energy will
be key against Marquette on Sun-
day.

As the conference leader, Mar-
quette brings a fast-paced offensive
attack that averages over 13 kills per
set and just under 13 assists.

According to Rens, the match-up ,
against Marquette will feature two
teams with similar styles of play. I

“Our goal each match is to dictate

' the tempo of play,” Rens said. “Mar-
quette has a similar game plan and
they are probably the quickest offense
in the Big East. It should be an exciting
match of high-paced volleyball.”

Leggs is lookingforward to anoth-
er chance to give a Big East rival their
ﬁrst conference loss of the season,
and she believes that the experience
against Louisville will motivate the
team this week in practice. —

“Now we know what it takes to get
the big win,” Leggs said. “With com-

munication and mentalfocus,wecan
compete with the best, including Syra-
cuse and Marquette.” I

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Soccer to

get a

new start     ’

Jon Anzur
Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s soccer team may
have ended its fall season by
dropping a. one-goal game to

West Virginia, but come Tuesday, '

a new one begins. _

The Panthers will start offsea-
son training next Monday —— a
few weeks earlier than last year
— after a downhill season where
the team only took home two vic-
tories. The annual postseason
program puts players through
grueling workouts and drills
designed to put them in better
physical shape.

Given that the team had its
worst season in more than a de-
cade, this offseason will help the
understrength Pitt squad move
forward. ‘

“I think that, especially after.
this year, the offseason islgoing
to be a main focus for us because
of how rough of a season we had,”
sophomore Katie _Lippert said.

The players will begin by lift-
ing weights and running three
times ‘a week with the team’s
strength coach to improve condi-
tioning and overall ﬁtness, traits
that head coach Sue-Moy Chin
called “extremely important” to
her team’s success. lg

.“You have to be mentally
strong and physically fit,” Chin
said. “That deﬁnitely plays a role
in being able to outlast and out-
run opponents. We want to take
pride in our fitness and strength,
and the gains that we make.”

While.l,1nderstanding the im-
portance of the workouts, some
players loathe the idea of con-
stantly training without any in-
teraction with a soccer ball.

“I’m already dreading going
into it,” sophomore and offsea-
son workout veteran Caroline

Keefer said. “It’s not fun at all. *

It’s a lot of hard work. But it deﬁ-
nitely does help us.”

She said it’s hard starting the
training because the Panthers
don’t actually play a game until
the end of March.

“It’s a lot of hard work 

without seeing any rewards for
it, since you can’t play or do
anything like that,” Keefer said.
“As it winds down into March --
around the end of February — it
starts to feel like soccer again
and not like they’re running us
to death.”

Lippert, who suffered a torn
hamstring in a game against Rut-
gers on Sept. 23 and hasn’t played“
since, said she is anxious to get
back to being active. .

“I’m sure most of the girls are
dreading the start of training,
but I’ve been out for so long that
I can’t wait to start running and
playing again,” she said. “I wasn’t
the strongest when I came to Pitt.
But your offseason is when you’re
able to build your strength, and I
think that’s going to be my main
focus. The running is extremely

' difficult, so by the end of train—, .

ing you’re probably in one of the
best shapes that you’ve been in.
It’s worth it.”

The Panthers began this sea-
son with 22 players, eight fewer
than most teams. Numerous
injuries further depleted their
already thin roster. Coach Chin
pointed to this as a possible rea-
son for her team only managing
two wins this year. She also said
that added strength can help

‘ prevent such injuries from hap— 1:

pening.

“We were very unfortunate
with the numbers [of healthy
players] this year,” Chin said.
“We had a lot of injuries that de-
pleted our numbers. So our girls,
have to be extremely fit to play"
90 minutes,‘Friday and Sunday,
every weekend. Most of them
played 90 minutes, and it takes
a toll on you.” .

Coach Chin said that Pitt’s
roster, which currently includes *
nine freshmen, six sophomores,
four juniors, and one returning
senior, will be infused with an
incoming freshman class of “at A
least 10” athletes, adding the
depth and competition that was,_
noticeably absent from her team
this season.

TASSER’S TAKE

A weekend watching

sports’ best

Donnie Tasser
Columnist

No matter what the sport, city or team, every
fanbase’s heart rate spikes at the mere men-
tion of its rival. There is no bigger thrill than
stomping on your rival and nothing more
humbling than when your team is the one

getting peeled off the ground like a Looney S

Tunes character.

That being said, here are the
best rivalry games from all over the
world of sports in the next fewdays.

Honorable Mention
NFL: New England vs. Pittsburgh

Sunday, Oct. 30, 4:15 p.m.
CBS ‘

My Pittsburgh bias caused me to throw
this borderline rivalry game in as an honor-
able mention. Although this match-up isn’t
on the same level as the Steelers-Ravens
or Patriots-Iets rivalries, it’s no secret that
there is little love between the two teams.

6 Tom Brady has always been a pain for the

Pittsburgh defense and its fans. I personally

detest the guy. These two teams have been ’
the stalwarts of the AFC and are the closest ‘

thing to a dynasty in pro football since the
Troy Aikman-led Cowboys of the 1990s. The
Pats have been to four Super Bowls over the
past 10 years, winning three, and the Steelers,
have been to three, winning two. The Patriots
are favored,’but with a suspect defense, the
Steelers might be able to squeak one out —-
but they’ll need to score at least 30 points.

5. College Football: Stanford vs. USC

Saturday, Oct. 29, 8:00 p.m.

ABC

The Stanford Cardinal and Southern Cali-
fornia Trojans have been going at it since
1905,‘ making it the oldest rivalry on the
West Coast. While the Cardinal dominated
early, USC took back control in the later
decades, numbing the dislike over time. But,
with the resurgence of the Cardinal under
former coach Jim Harbaugh and current
star quarterback Andrew Luck, the hate
has returned. Last year, Stanford needed
overtime to dispatch an inconsistent USC
team. Stanford is favored again this year,
but if USC limits mistakes at home in the
Rose Bowl, the Trojans could hand Stanford’s
new coach, David Shaw, his ﬁrst loss in the
Cardinal and White. 4

4. Barclays: Chelsea vs. Arsenal

Saturday, Oct. 29, 7:30 a.m.

ESPN2

Now I know not many of you red-blooded
Americans watch the patsy ‘English game
of “soccer,” but I urge you to tune into this
Barclays Premier League match between
two of the leagues’ traditional powerhouses.

rivalries

Although not geographical rivals in recent
years, their respective fanbases have voted
each other their most hated rival. Arsenal
is having a down year, entering the game
with four wins, four losses and a draw, but
the team features Robin van Persie, who
is fourth in Premier League in goals with
seven. Chelsea, on the other hand, is sitting
in third place with six wins, two losses and
a draw and is an undefeated 4-0 at home.
Now I’m sure I convinced you to get up at
7:30 a.m. to watch.

3. NHL: Montreal Canadiens vs. Boston
Bruins ,r'

Thursday, Oct. 27, 7:00 p.m.

NHLNET I

Saturday, Oct. 29, 7:00 p.m.

N HLN ET

Many consider this rivalry to be the great-
est in the NHL, and the hockey version of
the infamous Yankees—Red Sox contests.
Their series includes a lot of “mosts,” as in
the most games played between two teams
(702), the most playoff series played between
two teams (33) and the most Game Sevens
in any series history (eight). The Bruins, the
current defending Stanley Cup Champions,
had to use all seven games to defeat the Habs
in the playoffs last year, capping of a year full
of violent games between the teams. In early
February, an 8-6 Boston win saw six ﬁghts,
a goalie ﬁght between All—Stars Carey Price
and Tim Thomas and 187 total penalty min-
utes. About a month later, mammoth Bruin
defenseman Zdeno Chara brutally checked
Montreal’s Max Pacioretty into the glass be-
tween the bench areas, knockirig Pacioretty
unconscious and ending his season. The

’ teams play two games over the next several

days: tonight in Boston and Saturday night
in Montreal.

2. NFL: Dallas at Philadelphia
Sunday, Oct. 30, 8:20 p.m.

- N B C
Although both teams have had their strug-
gles this season, this game is still one of the
NFL’s premier rivalries. These two teams
have combined to win eight out of the last 10
NFC East Division titles, Philadelphia with
six and the Cowboys with two. However,
playoff woes _have struck both teams. Come
Sunday night, both teams are going to be
desperate and hungry for awin after bad
starts to their seasons, which means good
things for football fans. After all, what’s
better than a rivalry game? A rivalry game
when both teams need to prove something.

1. NBA: Players vs. Owners
Message to both sides: Hold strong. No
NBA means I don’t have to sit through bor-
ing NBA highlights to get to the sick hockey
plays on ESPN’s Top 10.

“[We] just got a little extra work with the
quarterbacks just to get the rhythm down and
timing, stuff like that,” he said.

In Graham’s absence, Brown stepped in to
not only lead the Panthers in receiving, but rush

for 33 yards on 12 carries.

“He’s a really good receiver out of the back-
ﬁeld,” Todd Graham said. “That’s part of what
we do..He made a lot of good catches and ran
the baH hard.”

Pitt free safetyjarred Holley said the team
expects other players to step up when injuries
occur. '

“Ray means so much to our team,” Holley
said. “He’s one of the biggest parts of our team.
But it’s a team sport. The great thing about our
team is when one of our guys goes down, there’s
always someone there to step up.”

Sunseri took the time totalkto Graham after
his injury.

“I wanted to make sure he knew he was one
of the toughest guys I knew and that I’m there for
him whenever he needs me and that he knows
what kind of person he-is,” Sunseri said. “We
have a really good friendship.”

Graham returned to the Pitt sideline on
crutches with ice on his knee in the ﬁrst half.
After the break, he remained on crutches with
a knee brace. Pitt ofﬁcials don’t yet know the
extent of the injury. V -

Todd Graham said that he doesn’t know the

if extent of Ray Graham’s injury but he was told

the tailback couldn’t return to the game. Pitt’s
star running back wasn’t the only Pitt player to
suffer an injury against Connecticut as injuries
affected the offensive line, including right guard
Matt Rotheram who. suffered an ankle injury

and left the game.

Left tackle Lucas Nix didn’t dress due to a
knee injury he suffered against South Florida.

After falling behind 21-3 in the ﬁrst half, Con-
necticut came out strong in the third quarter.

The Huskies scored on their drive of the
second half when blown coverage by Pitt left
wide receiver Isiah Moore wide open along the
sideline. Quarterback Johrmy McEntee found
Moore with a 62-yard touchdown pass, trim-
ming Pitt’s lead to 21-10.

Connecticut cut Pitt’s lead to 21-13 when
McEntee completed a pass to tight end Ryan
Griffin to the 10-yard line. But after McEntee
took a sack on third down, the Huskies had
to settle for a 31-yard ﬁeld goal that made the
score 21-13. .

“On a couple of those drives in the second

1 half, if we.would have played like that the whole‘

game_then I think we would have deﬁnitely come
out with a win,” McEntee said.

Pitt defensive tackle Chas Alecxih said the
Panthers weren’t going to let the game slip
away.

“We had alot of games this season when we
letthe team come back and we just put our foot
down and said we weren’t going to let them do
that,” he said.

Holley said that despite the attempted come-
back by the Huskies, Pitt just kept “pressing
on.”

g “The coaches talked to us on the sideline and

steps up in victory over UConn

kept telling us to stop the run and react to the
pass and that’s what we did,” he said.

The Panthers responded on their next drive,
boosting their lead to 28-13 when Sunseri com-
pleted passes to Hubie Graham for 29 yards,
Carswell for 13 yards and then hit Shanahan
for a 27-yard touchdown.

Pitt added to their lead near the end of the C’

fourth when Sunseri handed off to freshman
receiver Ronaldjones, who completed a 14-yard
pass to Street in the end zone.

Pitt’s defense played well overall, ﬁnishing
with six sacks for 40 yards lost. Pitt racked up

529 total offensive yards, compared to 316 yards .

for the Huskies. Both teams ran 71 plays.

“Pitt was doing a pretty good job on cover-
age and we actually ran the ball pretty well the
whole game.” McEntee said. “We had trouble
passing inthe ﬁrst half and we couldn’t convert
any third downs.“

Pitt scored on its ﬁrst drive of the game. ‘

Graham broke through the Connecticut defense
for an 18-yard run to the Pitt 48. He injured his
knee on the next play, but the Panthers con-
tinued the drive. Sunseri completed a pass to
Shanahan for 18 yards and then rushed for 11.
Sunseri ran the ball into the end zone on the
next play to give Pitt a 7-0 lead.

Soccer 4 15

Anthony Gima I Staff Photographer
After its worst seasonin more than a
decade, Pitt women’s soccer team looks
forward to its offseason.

class is that we have some good players
coming in and depth at every position,”
she said. “I think it’s going to create comj
petition at every position —- we lacked
that this year because of the numbers. If

someone wasn’t performing, it was tough '

because you didn’t have people to replace
them. The competition in the fall will be
greater because instead of having one girl
competing against you, you’re going to
have four or five girls competing for the
same position. It’ll help with the training.

It’ll helpvwith the focus and our overall 1

team dynamic.” _
With the core of the team returning,

the arrival of a deep freshman class and l

the improvements that are expected to be
made in offseason training, Chi-n and the
players both said that they expect better
outcomes next year. ,
“Our goal is‘ to compete and win a Big
East championship, and that’s going to
be our focus going forward,” Chin said.
_“Our goals aren’t going to change next
year just because of the year that,we had.

If anything, we’re more determined to do '

better.” . _

Keefer said she expects the Panthers
to have a better season next ‘year, and to
at least make the tournament and earn-a
winning record. ‘

“I just think that we’re a big school that -

should also have a big program,” Keefer
said. “Things went wrong this year.’ We
were building last year, then it all kind of
fell. But I think that we started to pick up
where we left off at the end ofthe season.
It should only go up from there.”, I
