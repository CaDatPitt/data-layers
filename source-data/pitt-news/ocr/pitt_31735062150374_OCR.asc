Girl Magician Will Perform

I in Foster Memorial Mondrty

Hold on to your hats, girls, and
hang on to your hearts, fellows.
Paddy is coming to the campus on
Monday afternoon.

Paddy, the 17-year-old “Miss who
Miss-tiﬁe. ’ will appear at the Magic
party in Foster memorial at 3:30
o’clock. Although the program has
been arranged by Cwens in honor
of i'res.hman women, and Druids
have b:=-‘en extended a special invi--
tsitior-, Paddy’s periormance is open
to all students at a ﬁve cent as-
sessmeiit.

The charming Paddy is the young-
t professional woman magician

_America. She is listed in the
‘Whos Who of American Magic-
ians’ and is a member of the Broth-
erhood of l\/lagicians.

Her interest in magic was born
when she was ﬁve. Howard Thurs-
ton, dean of American Magicians,
was appearing at the Alvin, and
at one point in his program he asked
children to come up and assist him

in a trick. One of the assistants
was eager, plump Paddy.

A very thrilled Paddy, to be sure.

And when Thurston jokingly told
the little girl she should be a magic-
ian, she solemnly promised she
would.

Paddy has traveled all over the
country demonstrating her skill. At
one time, too, she was a performer

on the liner “Normandie.” She
has appeared many times in Pitts-
burgh.

Since the outbreak of the war,

most of her time has been taken up
giving performances all over the
country for the beneﬁt of the Brit-
ish. War Relief fund.

This vest-pocket magician was
offered a stage career when she
was thirteen, but she turned it
down. And so today, in private life,
Paddy is a Butler High school sen-
ior. Often, while Jaiting her turn
or.-. stage, Paddy studies her next
g;ay’s lessons.

Local Assembly Gets Nowhere

In Debate on Constitution

.By mwm C. ROSEN

SFA met Wednesday night to dis-
cuss a new constitution, but after
a muddled two-hour session the
meeting was adjourned without ap-
proaching any of the problems that
have faced the constitution commit-
fee for the past three months.

Trying to answer a host of ques-
tions concerning the structure, or-
ganization, membership, functions,
and authority of SFA as outlined
in the new plan, members of the
association soon turned the discus-
sion into a verbal free-for-all, with
none of the new proposals being
put to a vote.
Whatfs Coordination

The actual report of Dave Tuck-
er, C41, chairman of the committee,
was climaxed by a series of pro-
posed amendments which Tucker
declared “would coordinate student
activities and further student life
at the University.” His speech
started a series of arguments, cen-
tering mainly on the phrase “co-
ordinating student activities,”
which reached a conclusion only
when, out of the melee, someone
asked, “What’s coordination?”

Attempts to unify the discussion
and to ﬁnd the purpose of the plan
were made by Mary McKenna, in-
structor in English and faculty
member of the assembly, and Len
O’Connell, C42, but they were lost
in the shufﬁe of words and ideas
which ensued.

Change SFA Name

Among the steps which Tucker’s
constitution committee suggested
taking were: changing the name of
SFA, following the elimination of
faculty members from the assem-
bly, adding advisory powers to the
authority of the association, and
adopting a new membership set-up
10.1‘ the organization.

Under the proposed plan, sections
of which met With stormy diggps
proval from some quarters of the
assembly disapproval from some
quarters of the assembly, the mem-
bership of SFA would consist of
eighteen representatives of the stu-
dent body, and nine activities rep-

resentatives, and three faculty
members, to consist of the chancel-
lor and the deans of men and
women.

The keynote of the meeting was
sounded early, however, when a let-
ter, written by Howard Schwartz,
C41, addressed to Joe Roberts, pres-
ident, accusing him of “stalling”
action on his proposal to set up an
accident prevention committee was
read. According to the letter, a
plan proposed to the executive
committee three months ago by
Schwartz, calling for a committee
to investigate safety hazards and
elinvinate them if possible, was
shelved.

Letter Provokes Giggling

Immediate reaction to Schwartz’s
letter took the form of tittering
and giggling, as Gene Pyle, secre-
tary, read the note, which said, in
part, “If SFA cannot act in three
months upon a matter with which
all its members agree, one wonders
how long it would take the associ-
ation to act upon something about
which there was a little dissension.”

The titters grew into chuckles
when Miss Pyle told the assembly
about the “little man” who had pre-
sented his idea in executive com-
mittee. It was only when Roy H.
Umbl.e, instructor in speech and
faculty member, told the assembly
how serious Schwartz was about
his plan, that a committee was set
up with the originator of the plan
as its chairman.

The only other actual motion
made following the creation of the
committee came two hours later
and called for adjournment.

Barr Proposes
Fund Increase:

Of s2.00,000

State Will Legislate

Biennial Allowance

, ».-.-.~.

   

The University biennial ap-
propriation from the State will
be increased if a. bill introduced
in the State legislature this Week
is passed.

The bill, presented by State
Senator Joseph M. Barr, Pittsburgh
Democrat, calls for an appropria-
tion of $1,438,000 for the Univer-
sity’s use. This amount is an in-
crease of $200,000 over the present
grant.

Pitt now receives for the two
years ending May 31, an appropria-
tion of $1,188,000 and $50,000 for

the School of Medicine, a total of .,

' Pays Tribute

$1,238,000.

Senator Barr proposes to make
the appropriation $1,438,000 for the
two years beginning May 1, 1941.
This amount includes both the grant
for the University proper and the
amount for the School of Medicine.

In 1939 the House committee of
appropriations attempted to cut ‘he
present appropriation by $88,000,
giving the University $1,100,000 in-
stead of the $1,188,000 amount ﬁnal-
ly approved by the assembly. This
cut was restored upon the recom-
mendation of Republican ﬁoorleader
Robert Woodside, and the present
amount was granted. While the bill
was being debated, University stu-
dents, under the direction of the
SFA committee, sent hundreds of
cards and many telegrams and pe-
titions protesting the additional cut.
In the bi-ennium previous to 1939,
the University also received $1,-
188,000.

Senator Barr, ’28, is secretary of”

the Allegheny county Democratic
committee, and former president of
the Young Democrats of Pennsyl-
Vania.

$100,000 to University
For Student Loan Use

De-serving Borrowers Permitted
Ten Years to Make Repayments

A liberal loan plan for University students which permits loans up
to $1000 with repayment over a possible period of ten years will be
established at the University soon, it was learned Wednesday when
lawyers revealed the provisions of the will of Howard Heinz.

The fund, which is named the Heinz Student Educational fund, to
be established at the University un.der the will of Howard Heinz, will

total $100,000.

The fund will provide for loans
up to $1,000 a year to needy and
deserving students. Persons who
borrow under the plan wifi’ be al-
lowed 10 years in which to make
repayment.

According to terms outlined in
the will, no interest charges are
to be made for the ﬁrst three years
after graduation. For the next tnvo
years two per cent interest will be
charged, and for the last five years
he interest rate will be four per
cent.

Mr. Heinz established the loan
fund for University students under
the Howard Heinz endowment, to
which he willed most of his vast
estate.

When lawyers who are executing
the will communicate with the
University, arrangements will be
made for an administrative agent to
mar-age the loan fund.

1‘/Ir. Heinz, a member of the board
of trustees of the University since
1906 and president of the H J.
Heinz company, died in Philadel-
phia February 9 at the age of 63.
Mr. Heinz was one of the donors of
the Heinz chapel, dedicated to the
memory of his father, H. J. Heinz,
and his grandmother.

Czech.oslovalcian Student Describes War H orrors on Land, Ocean;

Tells of Britons’ Pluclry Attitudes Despite Trying Conditions

. By GI-:oRGiA snUsE‘i‘

From Czechoslovakia to America
in two-not-so-easy‘ years has been
the experience of a University fresh-
man.

In the course of those trying
months, fair—haired George Gibian,
17-year-old student in the College,
underwent such ordeals as being
bombed at sea, shot at by a German
submarine, and being witness to
149 air raids in London.

The young man applied for his
visa to America in 1938, about the
time of the Munich affair, and went
to London to wait for that little
card that permitted him to leave
Europe.

He was allowed to depart from
Czechoslovakia without any trou-
ble.

The rest of his family were not so
fortunate.

His parents and two brothers at-
tempted to leave the little country

immediately after German occupa-
tion. Their ﬁrst try was unsuc-
cessful.

However, while in a Nazi concen-
tration camp, they had ample op-
portunity to ponder another ﬂight.
Incidentally, one of George’s broth-
ers, then 12 years old, was placed in
solitary conﬁnement for 24 hours——
for attempting to leave the country.

By this time George had arrived
in Paris, where he stayed for two
months before proceeding to Eng-
land. His parents and brothers
joined him in London several
months later.

Coming to America from London,
George traveled on one boat of a
convoy of 30. While on patrol duty
on»: day, he spotted what he sup-

posed to be a British patrol plane,
but which, when it swooped down
over the convoy and dropped three
“packages,” announced in no un-
certain terms that it was a Ger-
man dive—bomber.

A few days later the ship George
was on was threatened by an ene-
my submarine. The boats had been
forced to disperse after a severe
gale (there is danger of them hit-
ting each other in a storm) and
there were no destroyers near for
protection.

But a few shots from the British
boat forced the U-boat to sub-
merge, and eventually it gave up
the chase.

Describing the air raids in Lon-
don, George declared, “One could
see a group of small black dots on
the horizon which gradually be-
came larger as the drone of the

motors became more audible. Then
a series of huge ﬁres in the east end
of London would conﬁrm our fears
—that the dots were German
bombers.”

In the young student’s opinion,
the Britishers are unimaginative
folk—cold and quiet and reserved.
“They never get excited," he stated,
“and in this war, that is a good
thing. If they would stop to realize
that what happened to a neighbor’s
house might happen to their own
any minute, if they would allow
themselves to get hysterical, it
might mean their downfall.”

George drew a gloomy picture
when he described the conditions
in England as far as sleeping and
eating are concerned.

“At about ﬁve or six o’clock, one
can see lines of people waiting at

The Sad, Sad Case
Of Carrier’s Throttle

A SUGGESTION to stiﬁe Pitt News criticism of
SFA was made by a member of the executive
committee last Wednesday evening.

Dorothy Ann Carrier, explaining her inter-
pretation of better student government, said that
the Pitt News should not have the right to point
out to the student body any defects we see in
SFA. She declared that any criticism we have of
the group should be kept from the student body
and delivered only to SFA members themselves.

Needless to say, we disagree with her motion.
We disagree with any motion to suppress any in-
formation that we think the student body has a
right to know. And we believe that anything con-
cerning an activity whose members are elected by
the student body falls into this category.

The person making the gag-the-press sugges-
tion was using as a basis of her suggestion the
recent series of editorials analyzing Pitt student
government in which we portrayed the sad state
of student government at Pitt and especially
SFA.

It was ironic that such. a charge was made at
a meeting which demonstrated in dramatic detail
the need for clariﬁcation of not only the present
SFA structure but also the proposed one. Assem-
bly members and executive committee members
alike, revealed themselves as a coiifused, blunder-
ing lot, peeking at picayunish details and quibbling
over irrelevant terms for over two hours, while
the main issue on the subject remained unrecog-
nized and undiscussed till the closing secods of the
meeting.

It was then that Miss Mary McKcnna, faculty
member, and Len O’Connell, student, explained
that before any intelligent appraisal could be
made, the end object and ultimate purpose of the
revision committee must be made clear.

An explanation of this purpose was not made
by ﬂustered connnittee chairman Tucker nor was
it brought out in the sniping‘ by the stumbling
speakers from the ﬂoor.

In two previous editorials, we have pointed out
that the revision committee has to decide what
they want. If it is student government they are
after, drastic reformations in the present consti-
tutional framcwork are in order. If it is simply
a streamlining of the present SIM. they want, their
end-object is not student government, but a more
eﬂicicnt management of the private SFA activities.

In the meantime, it must be made clear to all,
that the Pitt News will continue to interpret the
actions of Pitt affairs. If not for any other reason.
the example of last lVednesda_v’s meeting shows
that the Pitt student‘ body deserves to be inform-
ed and so protected.

A Professor P1-eaohes
“That He Professes

WE LIKE our professors. All short stories
and columns written by high-school—graduates-
and-no-more to the contrary, we think they are
a rather ﬁne lot, subject to all the frailties to
which we are subject.

Vx7e have a chronic gripe, however, against the
well-known type of professor who shuffles a
lot of vagrant ideas into some semblance of
unity, has them printed, and sets the resultant
book up as the required text for his depart-
ment.

It is with a pleased and smiling countenance,
therefore, that we hear the news of the latest
action taken by Dr. Oliver L. R-eiser, of the
philosophy department.

We thought his recent “The Promise of Scien-
tiﬁc Humanism,” was the m.ost remarkable book
on contemporary philosophy recently to be stack-
ed pyramid-like upon the bookstands of the
country.

To require any other text for the course,
we thought, would have been a leaning-over
backwards, harmful to the best interests of the
student. I

Dr. Reiser went us one better. He makes
available to his-students the opportunity to buy
the book at a little over half the market price.
In doing so,.he forfeits the royalties which are his
contracted right. .

crawled back under another boulder.

SFA Grabs C&G Precedent:
Madhouse Rules at lweet

9 By s. F. AYERS

Cap and Gown came early to the campus in the form of Wednes-

day night’s monthly SFA meeting.

Under the chakmanship of David Tucker, C41, chairman of the re-

, vision committee, the assembly started on what might be called a debate,

a monologue, or a cheering and jeering section of a football game

Debate centered around what is
revision? Do we want revision‘?
Who would revision affect and
how would it be brought about‘?
Answers to none of these questions
were available when the curtain
rang down and the meeting ad-
journed.

As best that can be estimated, ac-
tion is where it was when the meet-
ing began. The assembly voted
to send the work of the revision
committee back to the revision com-

- mittee for more revision.

Supplementing the usual Robert’s
rules of disorder ‘Tucker introduced
his own particular brand of parlia-
mentary law which consisted of de-
fending his plan from the oppo-
nents, the supporters, and mainly
from himself.

Coming on the floor with a plan
which was inchoate, to begin and
incoherent to end with, Dave spent
the shank of the evening :3 -.'.-ying
to get his plan across to the as-
sembly, and the assembly spent the
evening trying to get across to
Tucker. Tucker won.

The remainder of the meeting
was spent, as usual in appointing
and disappointing various commit-
tees.

Comparatively sane was the mo-
tion of Mary Lewis to give each
fraternity representation, and the
independents a representation based
on their numerical ratio to fraterni-
ties. This would give the assembly
about 161 members. Purpose of the
whole reconstruction program is to
get a less cumbersome body. From

Wednesday night’s meeting the
prospects are not for a body but for
a cadaver.

Anarchism, which was the sub-
ject of some debate and deﬁnition,
seemed to be the chief winner at
the meeting.

Another meeting of the assem-
bly will probably take place in the
near future. Treasurer Dave Buente
is considering selling tickets. After
all, “I-Iellzapoppin” was a great ﬁ-
nancial success.

‘Frat’ Pamphlet

¢ By OSCAR SHEFLER

Edited by Jack Stauff, the latest
edition of the fraternity handbook
appeared on campus Wednesday.

The pamphlet, a gross thirty—two
pages, is the longest of its kind to
appear in many a month.

Speaking seriously, the chief ar-
ticle is a word and picture story,
entitled “Why Go Fraternity?” The
question is purely rhetorical, no an-
swer being provided.

0 Sad, Sad Story

“The Sad Case of Eustace Throt-
tle,” a story by Irv Kaufman, ful-
ﬁlls all the promise of its name. Here
we have another example of the
mastery of machine over man, the
entire typographical set-up being
but a minor indication of what
havoc can be wrought by the ma-
chinations of the linotype machine.
There are more italics in this than
there are in Albania, and the effect
is not pleasing to the eye.

Best features of the book are the
style page, w‘th a number of excel-
lent pictures of Grace McCombs,
freshman Betty Lou Carr, and some
mirrors; and Dick Kay’s page of
Tuck shop pictures.

A horrid, semi-Hurrel photo-
graph of an orchid too closely re-
sembles a laundry ad, one of those
things which reads, “This is what
your slip will look like when it
comes back.” It is a challenge to
the novice to evolve a photographic
doodle from what was formerly a
good, clean, white space.

0 Pitt Is Horrid

Bill McElwain’s “The Doctor
Takes a Ride” is atypical 1VIcEl-
wain, which means that it is light,
well—pointecl, and good reading.

In general, the bookdevotes too
much space to fraternity life. It
has too many murky-looking, ob-
scure pictures, poorly-laid—out.
Gene Pyle’s “Pitt” presents poten-
tialities which it immediately takes
back from under your nose, which
you are inevitably left holding be-
tween the thumb and foreﬁnger.

The book, ﬁnally, is one of the
best of its kind ever to appear and
IS generally poor because it at-
tempts much, achieves little.

A GROSS UNTRUTH REVEALED

. The nasty, nasty News, it seems, stated
in_ last Monday’s edition that tickets for
Military ball could be bought at $3 from
any member of the committee. According
to Sam Aronson, this is a gross untruth—-
tickets can be bought only upon apphca-
tron. (Members of the committee have
neither tickets nor applications, but mem.
bers_ of the corps will have applications
distributed to them in class next week.)
Others will have to wait until advance
estimates are in before tickets will be put
on sale to them, the student body. ROTC
students should consider whether they
want to go to the dance. so that they will
be able to fill out applications that win
came their way on February 24. Clear,
isn’t it? Clear as the proverbial mud.

Expressed

So everybody goes around these days defending those
European peoples. So we’ll be unfashionable and do-
mestic and defend the younger generation. Not that it
needs defending. Don’t misunderstand. Though it’s
been kicked around from time immemorial, the younger
generation has managed somehow to struggle through to
adulthood. And so, just for variety’s sake and in
healthy reaction, we say to our critics En Garde! We
are about to champion the cause of lost youth—and
“this” to you!

Father & Preacher

“You’re not responsible, son,” said father as he
knocked his pipe out on the parlor rug. Granted that
we younger generates are modiﬁed rakehells and ‘the
ominous mouthings and shakings of the heads of four
elders go unnoticed. But the taste of the bit of ‘re-
sponsibility will come soon enough to our mouths, and
we’ll swallow it. . ‘

“Why have you left the fold, my lamb?” ‘said the
preacher as he discarded the button some  .. .
put in the collection box. Because what was go
enough for mother and father is not and never will be
good enough for us. “Good” isn’t the right word,
though. Let’s say sufﬁcient. Did father and mother
have our schedule of classes? Did they have our social
responsibilities? Were they in as many activities as
we? No. Nor did they have only Sunday to catch up
‘on. their studies and their sleep. And they didn’t have as
many good Sunday movies, as many good concerts, as
many good radio programs. Far be it from me to be
irreverent, but somebody had better streamline Chris-
tianity in a hurry and not leave the job up to the,
Young Men’s Christian Association alone.

The Purely Medicinal

“And what about your drinking?” said the pro-
hibltionist as he sipped what he called purely medicinal.
Well, we like it just as much and no more than our
elders. But why don’t we drink cider‘? Cider may have
been all right in its day, and we suspect it was, consider-
ing that the relative alcoholic content of some “hard”
ciders would make a Zombie blush, but we live in an
age of afternoon teas where nobody drinks tea and the
hostess is constantly trying out new cocktail recipes.
And then again, look what the registration card has
done to the national consumption of “cokes.”

“And what about the girls that never blush at a
risque joke?” said the birth-controllist as she covered
up her instep. We know very well that they’re good
kids eiiid mean no harm, and they can tell a few hair-
frizzlers themselves. They have ideals as clean and as
honest as mother’s. And in the quietness of their
rooms they give the lie to their mixed-company deport-
ment, for there they all, every one, hope and dream of
that handsome prince charming who will come dashing
up in a yellow Buick someday and make them the hap-
piest woman in the world. And if this delicate co-ed
should fall down two flights of stairs rather indeli-
cately, does she hurry home, put on a coif and go into
a nunnery? No. She gets up with amazing aplomb
and guffaws with the rest of us who are standing around
doing just that.

Here Today . . . ?

We seldom stop in our “joie de vivre,” to argue or
excuse our conduct, but if we should, would we not say
that here we are today and who can tell tomorrow
whether we shall be loaned or leased to the British
Commonwealth. Or clerking over an account book for
eight hours a day and spending the remaining sleepless
hours dreaming of the wife, the job, the salary that we
wish tohigh heaven we had. .

God bless the younger generation. May it survive
the world to censure its children.

Lines to Limbo

Song for Three Voices
C By Angelo Bruno

First Voice:

The troop trains are rolling in Roumania

Do you hear them? can you see them coming?
Through Bogan and the winter patched valleys,
Through Potkova, Slatina, and Valem,
Across the Dimbovita River, where once
The wine was pressed by gypsy feet,

To Alexandria, Gratta, tiny Guirgin

Down to the traditional Danube,

Then to Bucharest, city of beautiful women
The troop trains are rolling in Roumania.

Second Voice:

I remember Roumania not as a Flemish pastoral

With landscaped trees under a paling sun,

But instead as a country with an inner mystery
Unfathomable beneath an oriental brow.

I remember the color of her exotic roses,

A red deeper than-blood, as heavy in texture;

I remember the sweat of the shining oil wells,
The steel shooting upwards into a gypsy night;

I remember most of all the songs of the peasants,
The hills ringing with their rich, swarthy laughter.
Third Voice: A

The troop trains are rolling in Roumania

Come into the house, child, go to sleep

The troop trains are rolling in Roumania

Do not whimper, sweet child, do not weep.

For father will go to the new shining city

To buy you a new encephalogram

O lulla, lulla, lullaby
O lulla, lulla, lullaby
For Father will go to the new shining city
To buy you a new encephalogram.

Trackers Seek Repeat
Victory over Michigan

Injury-Ridden Olsonites Pin Hopes
On Anderson, Sterner, Allias Trio

. By BEN room
Two goliaths of the cinder track
clash tonight before a capacity
crowd in one of the feature dual
meets of the indoor season when
coach Carl Olson’s thinclads bat-

tle Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Riddled by injuries, the Pitt
squad hopes to make it two straight
over the Wolverines after the sen-
.sational 67-64 win last spring. But
the black-moustached mentor of the
Pitt squad is quaking in his boots.
As is his usual habit, he predicts
nothing but dire defeat for his
charges.
Anderson On Spot
The prospects aren’t nearly as bad
as Olson would have his followers
believe, despite Happy Stickel’s
probable seat on the sidelines. If
three men come through for the
"Panthers they’re in-—Del Anderson,
Zeke Sterner, and Marcus Allias.

Anderson meets the toughest
competition of this trio, and right

Pitt S'wim.mers
Favored to Top
Di plomnt Squad

Pitt’s su.—'imming squad should
have little trouble in gaining their
second victory of the season, when
they meet Franklin and Marshall’s
mediocre mermen tomorrow at the
latter’s home pool.

Although Dick Price is the East-
ern Collegiate’s top 220-yard free
styler, the other members of the
Diplomat squad have little to offer
Sprint
swimmer Macionis may offer some
trouble in both the 50 and 100 yard
free style races but the memory of
Wilde’s stretch win over Penn
State’s Bill Kirkpatrick discounts
any fear in that department.

Kachel, Gager, Rogers, and Mey-
ers are the other F & M free-styl-
ers. Badoff takes care of the back-
stroke division, while Phillips
swims in the breaststroke events.
Divers Kellan and Waring should
prove easy pickins for the superior
abilities of Dick Ames and Joe
Kaule.

In addition to Wilde, Ames, and
Kaule, Grady is taking Herb Cos-
grove, Joe Orloff, Al Samson, Bob
Soles, Al Fedor, Art Vitartis, Marty
Kramer, and Bob Jackson to the
Franklin and Marshall meet.

Every member on the Panther

squad seems to have found renewed

spirit after tasting the fruits of vic-
tory last week. As is the usual cus-
tom in the practice sessions, the
swimmers are clocked in their re-
spective specialties. The “times”
recorded this week show a deﬁnite
improvement over those of last
month.

Should a victory over Franklin
and Marshall have the same effect
on the boys as the Lion success,
chances of retaining the Eastern
Collegiate championship would be
greatly increased.

The Collegite festivities are sched-
uled to get underway March 7, and
will continue through March 8. Rut-
gers will play host to the swim-
mers in the Eastern circuit this year.

now he’s one of the toughest boys
on the Pitt team to beat. The ﬂy-
ing senior has even been threaten-
ing the immortal Johnny Wood-
ruf‘f’s records in the Pitt trackhouse
and is running as fast as he ever
did outdoors. He reeled off a 3:15
three quarters last Tuesday night
and breezed in at the ﬁnish fresh as
a mountain spring.

His chief competition tonight will
probably come from Paul Kautz and
Jack Leutritz. However, no matter
who the opponent is, Anderson will
certainly make him run 1:55 or
under to beat him. Anderson_’s an-
telope-like strides will also be fea-
tured in the anchor slot of the mile
relay team.

Allias Question Mark

Walt Sterner, the best cross coun-
try runner in Pitt history, Will also
be an important factor in the Pitt
victory quest as he attempts to win
his ﬁrst two mile race of the 1941
campaign. A 9:45 race isn’t too
much to expect from the sightly
built senior.

Biggest question mark in to-
night’s c ntest is Allias, sophomore
 "" " ‘ ' '= miler. Allias has
never gone “all
 out” in a mile
 race, but he will
 have to tonight,
since he’ll be in
3 very fast com-
: pany.

_ In the remain-

ing events, the
Pitt hurdlers are
 the most doubt-
, ful quantities.
A Bob Hall, Michi-
gan senior and
- Terry McIntyre,
Andersml Maize and Blue
sophomore, are favored over veteran
Joe Newman and sophomore Harry
Clark inithe highs, but Newman is
capable of pulling a surprise.
Stickel, who played a leading role
in the Pitt triumph over the Wol-
verines last spring, will probably
have to give way to Clark and Bob
Norton in the lower sticks.
Victory Possible

Should the Blue and Gold thin-
clads gain a maximum number of
points in the two hurdle races, half-
mile, mile and two mile, they should
win the meet. Bullet Bill Carter
should take the 60-yard dash and
the broad jump; Dusty Rhoades and
Red Jessup should ﬁnish one—two
in the pole vault; Dave McDowell
rates a good second in the high
jump and Larry Tregoning, Bud
Graf and Regis Larkin might pos-
sibly squeeze out a second among
them in the 440.

The Wolverines are favored in the
mile relay in addition to the high
jump, and shot put, and as stated
before, ﬁve pivotal events mean the
difference between victory and de-
feat.

Hurtwig N umed
Guard Mentor
F or Gridders

Charles “Doc” Hartwig, former
Panther grid star, has been added
to the football coaching staff at his
alma mater, succeeding Luther
Richards, who resigned last Sep-
tember to accept a coaching job at
Greensburg high school.

Hartwig is better known as a
member of that terriﬁc trio, Hart-
wig, Ormiston, and Shotwell, all
of whom were chosen on many of
the various all-American teams in

1934. He became a regular guard
at Pitt in 1932, his sophomore year,
on the undefeated team that went
to the Rose Bowl.

The new assistant mentor came to
Pitt from Benwood, W. Va., where
he played stellar football in high
school. He entered the coaching

profession in 1938 as headof the, ,

l\/loundsville, (W. Va.) high school
grid team. Before this, Hartwig
had been on the sales force of an
automobile sales company.

Pitt’s grid coaching staff, includ-
ing head mentor Charlie Bowser, is
made up entirely of former Panth-
er football greats. Nick Kliskey,
Bob Hoel, ‘Curly” Stebbins, Arnold
Green, Bill Daddio, Dick Fullerton,
Hal Klein, and John Dickinson all
feel right at home on the Stadium
sod.

Pitt students are funny creatures.
Psychologists say that average peo-
ple love to back a winner; maybe
that is true. As a Pitt student we
really don’t know.

From the golden era of Pitt foot-
ball to the seemingly hopeless pres-
ent days, the students have full
heartedly worshipped the gridiron
sport.

In the past Pitt has always been
known for its great, super-teams
with I~iartwigs, Daddios, and Gold-
bergs in abundance. One can read-
ily see why those winning football
teams were backed.

0 Students Support Gridders

Today Pitt’s football picture
seems to be far from bright; their
yesteryear championship caliber

football has dwindled considerably.
But believe it or not, the student
body is still loyal. So on this point
we give three cheers. 

Now to the basketball scene. Dr.
Carlson has put out, this year, one of
the finest aggregations to ever per-
form on the Stadium basketball
ﬂoor. Are the students giving
them the proper following? Is a
crowd of 500 students good repre-
sentation for our 5,000 student en-
rollment?

0 Other Teams Draw

Many blame the poor attendance
on the inadequate accommodations
which the Stadium court presents
to the students. This excuse seems
rather weak when we think of our
neighborhood rivals. Duquesne
packs 1,500 students in their band-
box Hilltop gym. At the home of
the Skibo, attendance is still rela-
tively high despite a winless season.

W & J, Geneva, and Westminster,

* ketball

with their small enrollments, still
have had larger crowds at the bas-
games than Pitt. Why
shouldn’t Pitt ﬁll the Stadium with
a winning squad?

Track, under the guidance of
coach Carl Olson, has always been
uppermost in the University’s ath-
letic accomplishments. But not on
the attendance basis.

Since 1933 when Olson arrived
at Pitt, he has won two IC4-A ti-
tles, one CIC indoor title, and nine
Penn Relay championships. In dual
meets he has a record of 15 straight
victories over such track powers as
Notre Dame, Michigan, Indiana,
Penn State, and Ohio State.

These titles only help to show
that Pitt track teams are riding a
crest of victory. Boys like Stickel,
Ohl, Woodruff, Carter, aand Rhoades
just don’t appear every day.

0 Sell-Out At Michigan

The scheduling of Pitt at Phila-
delphia, State College, Pa., New
York or any other track town means
a certain sell-out crowd. Today at
Ann Arbor, Michigan, Pitt meets
the Big Ten champion Wolverines.
From the athletic offices, reports
state that the ﬁeld house is com-
pletely sold out for this week.
Would Pitt students do that?

Vv'hen Johnny Woodruff, Pitt’s
contribution to track immortals, ran
for his university the situation was
the same. Time and time again the
only people to watch him run were
his teammates and the sports writ-
ers.

Interestingly, there is no charge
for admittance to track meets. In
fact, the gates are wide open, plead-
ing for the student following.

Some Mob Psychology »

So you see, even though we must
give credit to football fans for sup-
porting a losing team, we must
criticise them for not giving cham-
pionship basketball and track per-
formers proper encouragement.

Do Pitt students love to back a
winner? » We don’t know, we only
go to school here.

Alumni Plans
Charter Fete

An informal jubilee on Friday
evening coupled with a formal sup-
per. dance Saturday will highlight
the 1941 Charter day celebration
being sponsored by the General
Alumni association, next week-end.

Gene Burkhart, acting secretary
of the General Alumni association,
has issued alumnae invitations for
both Friday and Saturday night’s
events. The informal jubilee Fri-
day, in Foster Memorial will be “on
the house.” Last year a capacity
crowd paid 80 cents per person.

Entertainment plus with “ne’er a
dull moment” has been promised to
alumnae and friends.

Chancellor John G. Bowman, Dr.
George Clapp, secretary of the board
of trustees, and Harbaugh Miller,
president of the Alumni association,
will speak at the affair. In addition,
Joe Roberts, BA41, president of
SFA, and Mary Ruth Hosey, Ed41,
president of WSGA, will represent
the students. Entertainment by the
lVIen’s varsity quartet, and a string
trio will round out the program.

Five seniors make their last ap-
pearance on the Stadium basket-
ball court tonight when Pitt’s Panth-
ers go after the Geneva Covenant-
ers and their sixth straight win.

Winding up the best season in
their three-year varsity career,
Pitt’s seniors start against a squad
that gave them a tough tussle be-
fore bowing, 50-36, last week.

Two years ago the sophomore
wonders, last year still wondering
when the victories would start to
roll in, the Pitt big ﬁve ﬁnally ar-

Kocheran, and Jimmy Klein have
started consistently, played pretty
consistent basketball, and knocked
down nine assorted basketball teams
and Carnegie Tech.

Billie Slumps

Against the Tartans in Tuesday
night’s game, Pitt rolled up an 18-1
lead over what looked like a slight--
ly below—par high school team, ran
into a Tech hot streak that cut their
lead to six points, and ﬁnally coast-
ed through to a 38-29 win.

Despite the slump of 1939 sensa-
tion John Billie, the Genevans have
molded a formidable quintet around
ace marksman Danny Visciarelli.
Other probable Geneva starters are
Willard Jersey, Chuck Devenzio,
Bob Palmer, and Dick Hart, W"th
Billie held in reserve but expected
to see plenty of action.

In the ﬁrst Pitt-Geneva battle,
Port and Kocheran both outscored
Geneva’s sophomore sharpshooter
Visciarelli, who was held to three
ﬁeld goals.

Carnegie Sloppy

A slight recession set in last Tues-
day, caused partly by the contagi-
ous character of the Tartan’s sloppy
sickness, partly by remarkable
shooting by Tech in the ﬁrst few
minutes of the second half, partly
by the insertion of Pitt’s second
team at the start of the second pe-
riod.

Carnegie failed to score a ﬁeld
goal until two minutes before the
end of the ﬁrst half, which ended
with Pitt 0 the long end of a 23-7
count.

Forfeits Again Mar
I-F League Results

Fraternity intramural teams in-
active since the pre-exam days,
started up again on Monday and
Tuesday, and played some volley-
ball and table tennis.

Forfeits were again numerous
with SAE, Lambda Chi, Sigma Chi,
Phi Kappa, and Theta Chi either
forfeiting or double-forfeiting.

Winners by forfeit were the Phi
Delts, Phi Gamma Delta, PiKA, and
the Sammies.

In the games that were played
Kappa Sigma beat Delta Tau Delta,
2-1, while table tennis teams faired
a little better in forfeited games
than did volleyball. In the only
three games played, the Delts de-
feated Phi Eps, 9-3, and the Phi
Delts beat Kappa Sigma, 7-5. The
pre-season: favorites, Delta Tau

Delta, walloped the'Phi Gams, 12-0. ;

Professor From Egypt A

‘ Visits Faculty Member

Dr. Wendell Cleland, professor at
the American university, Cairo,
Egypt, visited William J. Martin,
assistant professor of history, re-
cently and toured the Cathedral
with him.

Dr. Cleland, professor of sociology
and director of extension work, is
an authority on political and social
conditions of Egypt. He arrived in
the United States last fall after a
voyage which included an airplane

. trip from Cairo to Capetown, fol-

lowed by a cruise from Capetown to
New York. Dr. Cleland has been
living in Egypt since 1917.

the entrances to the underground

others merely carrying rugs to cov-

“I assure you very few of them get
a good night’s rest.”

And food is really rationed in
England-—with exceptions for no
one.

Margerine is usually substituted
for butter and there is a marked
scarcity of eggs. Also, tea and su-
gar are difficult to obtain.

When George and his family
clocked in Boston harbor, their ﬁrst
stop in America, they were more
than happy to see so many automo-
biles, and to see lights at night. In
England there is not much gasoline
to spare and autos are not often
seen. And lights were a welcome
change from the regular London
black-outs.

“In London, police and ﬁre units
are equipped with bells, and sirens
could mean only one thing--3'11‘
raid!”

The young Czech is living with
his family on McKee place in the
Oakland district. An older brother,
however, is attending North Caro-
lina university, to which he re-
ceived a scholarship.

“I am looking for part-time em-
ployment,” George declared. “I
am well qualiﬁed to teach German,
particularly conversational German,
to anyone who would like to take
lessons, and I would appreciate it
if they would get in touch with me.”

Medical Reserve
Corps to Grant
32 Colnniissions

Complete preparations for an
army base hospital unit to be used
in the event that the United States
enters a war, are being made by the
School of Medicine at the request
of the Surgeon-General’s oflice in
Washington.

Commission in the Medical Re-
serve Corps will be issued to 28
members of the School of Medicine
faculty and four faculty members
of the School of Dentistry. Rec-
ommendations have been sent to
VVashington, Dr. William S. McEl-
roy, dean of the School of Medicine,
revealed.

The faculty members, who will
supply the professional services to
the unit in case of war, will receive
the following commissions: medical
——-one lieutenant colonel, two ma-
jors, three captains, and three ﬁrst
lieutenants; surgical—one lieuten-
ant colonel, three majors, five cap-
tains, ﬁve ﬁrst lieutenants; ear, eye,
nose and throat—one captain, one
ﬁrst lieutenant; roentgenology—one
major; laboratory-—-one maior, one
ﬁrst lieutenant, and‘ dental-one
major, one captain, and two ﬁrst
lieutenants.

The reserve hospital unit, staffed
by officers from the regular army
corps as administrative officials, will
be capable of being organ:-_-ed. into
a base hospital whose rzormal ca-
pacity will accommodate 1,000 pa-
tients.

If called upon for actual service
the commissioned personnel will
number 42 officers. Included in the
enlisted personnel of 400 will be 120
nurses, recruited from the regular
army lists.

Whenever possible, as in the case
of the Pitt unit, the reserve base
hospitals are organized in hospital
centers to permit economy of over-
head and to allow specialization
which otherwise would be impos-
sible.

Rorcﬁilota
Goes Up, Up

Statistics compiled by the War
department show that the Univer-
sity has a larger quota of students
entitled to take the Reserve Offi-
cers Training corps course than any
other college that offers the course
voluntarily in the third corps area.

The Third corps area includes:
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
and the District of Columbia.

The only schools which surpass
Pitt in the allowance quota are Penn
State, Virginia Military institute,
Virginia Polytechnic institution,
and the University of Maryland. All
of these are land—grant colleges as
established by the Morrill Act of
1867 making their military instruc-
tion courses compulsory.

In the advanced course which in-
volves the third and fourth years in
college, the enrollment in Pitt is
allowed up to 209 as compared to 42
for Duquesne and 143 for the Car-
negie Institute of Technology.

In the basic course, which consti-
tutes the ﬁrst two years, Pitt has
been allotted the quota of 1001 as
compared to 170 for Duquesne and
412 for Carnegie Tech.

Previous to the new quota, Pitt
had a total of 901. During the
term of 1940-41, 100 students were
not included in the quota. There-
fore, the miltary department re-
ceived no credit for them and they
were clothed with discarded uni-

forms.

National Guard Units
Leave Pitt Barracks

First and second battalions of the
One Hundred Seventy-Sixth Field
artillery of the Pennsylvania Na-
tional guard vacated barracks at
Alumni hall yesterday. The ﬁrst
battalions departed for Fort Meade,
Md., by train, and the second board-
ed a truck convoy for the same des-
tination.

Alumni hall will not be used in
the future as barracks for National
guard units, it was announced by
the office of the secretary of the
University. The entire building,
which was remodeled recently will
be given over to the department of
chemistry.

Liebman Will Address
Sunday Chapel Service

Appearing under the auspices of
the National Conferences of Chris-
tians and Jews, Rabbi Joshua Lieb-
man, of the Temple Israel in Bos-
ton, will speak at the weekly pub-
lic Vesper service in Heinz chapel
Sunday afternoon at 3 o’clock. Sub-
ject of his address has not been an-
nounced.

Since the Heinz chapel choir is
singing in Atlantic City this week,
the Taylor Alderdice high school
chorus will appear as guests. They
will present “In Heaven Above” by
F. Melius Christiansen and “Eniitte
Spiritum Tuurn” by Franz Joseph
Schuet cy.

T\.venty—four years ago, a staff of
men was chosen from the faculty of
the Uni\'ersity’s School of Medicine
to head the University of Pittsburgh
Base Hospital 27.

By the end of May 1917, the pro-
fessional equipment for the unit
was in order and enlisted men and
nurses enrolled. On June 20 the
officers were all commissioned, and
the unit awaited orders.

Debaters Talk.
011 U. S. Policy

Approximately 50 delegates from
ﬁve district schools and members
of the Men’s Debating association
will assemble on campus tomorrow
afternoon to discuss the foreign
policy of the United States in re-
gard to the war and aid to England,
announces Samuel Rodgers, C41,
who will preside at the assembly
scheduled to take place in 132 Ca-
thedral from 1 to 1:30 o’clock.

Rodgers reports that represen-
tatives from Carnegie Tech, Mt.
Mercy, VVestminster, Geneva, PCW,
as well as members of the varsity
and freshmen debate squads will
introduce arguments ranging all the
way from an outright declaration of
war on G-ermany to complete isola-
tion  no aid to England.

This is the first time the Univer-
sity debaters have deviated from a
more formal debate presentation
while on campus. The large number
of participants expected to engage
in the discussion indicated that they
would have to abandon the formal
presentation of arguments and sub-
stitute the convention type, or dis-
cussion from the ﬂoor.

The plan has met with repeated
success elsewhere as it usually pro-
notes more action, explains Rod-
gers.

OU don’t need a science degree to tell you that the
pleasure you get from a cigarette is in the smoke itself!

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Winston-Salem. North Carolina.

That’s plain common sense! But science can tell you—has
pointed it out many times-—that Camels are deﬁnitely
slower-burning. That means a smoke free from the harsh,
irritating qualities of excess heat—a smoke that is extra
mild, extra cool, and extra ﬂavorful.

Now science conﬁrms another important advantage of
Camel’s costlier tobaccos and slower way of burning—less
nicotine in the smoke (see above). So light up a Camel——now.

Try Camels. Smoke out the facts for yourself.
