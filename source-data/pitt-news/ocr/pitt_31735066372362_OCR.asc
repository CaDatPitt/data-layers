We’reNo. 1! Polls Rate PittTops

 By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The Pitt Panthers ascension to

the No. l spot in collegiate foot-
ball yesterday wasn’t accompan-
ied by wild exuberance or chest
pounding. finger—waving bra-
vado from the players.
, Or. as Pitt defensive end Chris
Doleman said. “We’re just No. l
today. We want to be No. lat the
end of the season."

The Panthers. now 7-0 and
one of only two unbeaten major
college football teams in the Uni-
ted Press lnternationaland the
Associated Press weekly college
football rankings in the country.
became the sixth team this year
to inherit the No. l spot thanks
to previously top-ranked Penn
State‘s l7—l4 loss to l9th—ranked
M iami.( Fla.) and Pitt‘s 29-24 vic-
tory over Boston College
Saturday.

Pitt easily outdistanced No. 2
Clemson. also undefeated at 8-0.
and No. 3 Southern California
for the top spot in the AP poll. _
The Panthers received 49 first-
plaee votes to Clemson‘s nine.
despite Clemson’s 82-24 slaugh-
. ter of Wake Forest. Saturday.

College. Pitt Coach .lackie Sher-
rill says the Panthers belong at
thetop when you get down to the
basics.

“Winning is the bottom line.
We‘re finding ways to win and
that‘s what counts." said Sherrill.
“I don’t think anyone deserves it
over us. At this point the No. l
team has to be undefeated."

Predicting Pitt‘s rise to the No.
l spot when the season began
would have probably won a
prognosticator a rubber room
and a couple of attendents.
Thanks to a graduation rift that
was anything but kind and the
bevy of new starters now gracing
the Panther line-up. a Top I()

the promised land in September.

“I don’t think anyone on the

new faces who has played a big
part in Pitt’s success. “Everyone

and that the faculty would be stabil-
ized at I0. and that the dean appre-
ciated the hardships imposed on the .
students by the temporary lack of
critical faculty mass necessary for
attracting students. .

The geography graduate student
organization is seeking withdrawal
of the dean's termination proposal
and believes that any consideration
of the dean‘s current proposal prior
to the resolution of its grievances is
also in violation of its understand-
ings with the dean.

The Social Sciences Council and
an ad hoc committee are currently
deliberating the matter.

Rosenberg declined to comment
on the charge.

The struggle between Rosenberg

_and the geography department goes

back to November l976. when the
dean asked the Senate Budget Poli-
cies Committee to evaluate the
department. In early I977. an ad hoe
committee of the Social Sciences
Council was also formed.

Their summarized findings
included that the department
“should be maintained." that geo-
graphy “has an important role at the
university." that the department
should be “restructured to reflect
more clearly the changing character
ofgeography.“and that there should
be “vigorous redirection under the
leadership of a new chairpe‘rson."re—
cruited from outside the current
faculty." «

The dean took up the responsibil-
ity of these findings and set up a
search committee to find the new
chairman. The current chairman.
Hibberd V.B. Kline. had planned to

make 1976-77 his final year as
chairman.
Two sets of candidates were

interviewed” one set during the
winter term of I978. the other
between the winter and spring terms
of l979. Offers were made. the dean

Senate Council DebatesAccou nti n g, Libraries

By SETH LUBOVE ’
If the objective of a university
senate is to facilitate discussion-
and criticism of an institution’s poli-
cies and procedures. Pitt's Senate
Council carried out its duty Monday
on a score of topics. ranging from
university compliance with federal
accounting procedures to the report

of the task force on university ‘

libraries. .

While the council passed only one
resolution. accepting as councjl view
or opinion a “statement of under-
standing concerning planning _and
Resource management system
procedures (PRMS).“ a lengthy dis-
cussion centered oh federal govern-\
ment requirements that Pitt report
in greater detail the expenditure of
federal research funds.-

Dr. John Armstrong ofthe Grad-
uate School ofPublic Health. speak-
ing as a “concerned faculty member.
cited published articles and state-

ments by leading scholars crit_icaI of i

the Office of Management and
Budget‘s Circular A-2|.

    
   
   
   
   
     
       

  

  

 
     
 

1-2::

The circular is a requirement for
universities to rﬁport in detail the
time and effort ofpersons involved
in federally sponsored research.

Armstrong recommended that the
council find out if his views oppos-
ing the federal requirements were
held by senior university administra-
tors; seek advice on howvto pursue
revisions through “political chan-
nels,“ and “straighten out" any
ambiguities’ in the reporting
requirements.

Jack Freeman. senior vice chan-
cellor for administration. responded
that while most university adminis-
trators agreed with Armstrong’s
opinion. “the battle against A-2l has
been met and lost."

While Freeman was optimistic
that “at some point in the future
some major aspects of A-2| may be
changed." he added that unless
something drastic happened. Pitt
would have to‘ comply with the

stringent accounting requirements. '
Freeman said A-2l was a result of

   -INCONCER

poor audit reports received from a
majority of American universities’
which had had federally sponsored
projects between 1975-79. Since
Congress was a driving force behind
A-2|. OMB was simply taking the
initiative. Freeman said.

He added that in an effort to com-
municate the A-2| procedures. the
university has held more than 40 '
training seminars in September and
October for deans and. department
Chairpersons.

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
said that the stringent reporting
requirements resulted from “a sense
of indignation on the part of Con-
gress and the OMB by what they
perceived to be a cavalier attitude on
the part of universities toward fed-
eral research funds.“

He added that there was“no prac-
tical way that we could expect to
win" any relief from the require;
ments from Congress.

Posvar sa_id that when he metwith

this year as part of a task force on
academic reform. the A-2I reporting
requirement was cited as a major
concern. ‘

Posvar said Bush “seemed
shocked and concerned" about A-

As past of its fiscal year I983

Pitt said thaticompliance with the
new A-2| new reporting require-
ments are expected to cost close to
$2 million in the next three years.

In other business. Richard Pratt.
chairman of the Senate Educational
Policies Committee. was critical of
some of the incentives. or lack of
them. to induce the faculty and stu-

' dents to enroll in the Semesterat Sea

program.

Most of his remarks. however.
centered on consistency. I

"What is needed for the program is
“continuity in administration ofthe
program. and continuity in curricu-
lum and planning for curriculum."
he said.

On the current Semester at Sea
voyage. only four Pitt faculty
members are on board. Icd by 393‘
demic dean Tobias Dunkelberger.

The universitv will have to give
more incentives -to register. I’I"<_1Il
said. and not make it such a financial
hardship."

Pratt added that the university
was at a disadvantage in offeringthe
program because of the make-up of
the student body and Pitt‘s role as a
“urban. non-residential university."

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg responded
that any incentives. particularly
financial. would have to be carefully
scrutinized so there was “no net
drainage of funds from the
university."‘

people in the community were
right." Masterson admitted.

He also said that although the
company applied for an occupancy
permit more than a week before the
opening. the theater had been oper-
ating without the permit.

Masterson said the company
opened anyway because it was open-

‘ ing night and the tickets had already

been sold. ,

Jay Roling. assistant vice chancel-
lor for public affairs. said today‘s
meeting is being held to “review the

‘ items of work necessary and prepare

an estimate in order to proceed with
that work.“
In response to the community

groups’ charges that they were

excluded from the planning process.
Roling said that it normally takes “a
couple of months" to get anything
through OI")l’s planning process.

“In this case(thctheater). timedid
not permit it." he said.

was unfortunate." Roling admitted.

Dorm
Burglar
Sentenced .

By KERRY WEIL

A Squirrel Hill man has been
sentenced to 5 years probation
and restitution for the robbery of
‘a University of Pittsburgh dor-
mitory suite last spring.

Twenty-year old Charles A.
Benett. of Beechwood Boule-
yard. was sentenced by Criminal
Court Judge James Clark on
Oct. 7. for the robbery of an
eighth-floor Brackenridge suite
on April l5. Thejury deliberated
for‘three hours before reaching a
decision. '

During the trial. prosecution
witnesses Karen Rupp. of Car-
bondale. Pa.. and Annie Carlotti
of Erie. Pa.. testified that Benett
had forcibily entered their
Brackenridge suite while they
had been out shopping. Upon
returning at o:45 p.m.. Carlotti
and Rupp confronted Benett as
he fled from the suite. The vic-
tims later discovered thatjewelry
valued at $400 had been taken
from their suite.

The defense held that Benett
had attended the Round Ball
Classic at the Civic Arena on the
night in question.

In his closing argument.
Assistant District Attorney (ire-
gory Fit‘/patrick maintained that
Benctt had been positivcl_v iden-
tified by the victims on several
occasions. __

(iary l.anca.st_cr. the defense
‘\ attorney.concluded byquestion—
ing thejury ifthey could "be sure.
beyond a reasonable doubt“ of
their decision. “due to the lack of
collaboration by the witnesses."

Court records indicated that
Benctt’ had been arrested on
three prior accounts. but no con-
victions had been made.

The latest of these incidents
occurred in another Pitt dormi-
tory. Amos Hall. iir_.lune l9ts'0.
The case was dismissed because
the vvitness could not make a
positive identification. A

  Geography Grads FiI'iieiiiGrievanceiWith Dean

<'onrinucd_/'rom page one

said. but they were all refused.
“We did have a bona fide recruit-

ment effort.” Rosenberg said. “We .

had a good search committee. we
identified some good candidates. we
weighed then and made relative
judgments and did make some offers
to several people. but we weren’t
successful."

The geography graduatestudent
organi7ation. however. claims the
negotiations were “protracted and
fruitless." and that they were “drawn
out.”

After the final candidate refused.
the dean offered Edward Muller of
the history department as a chair-
man candidate in [)ecember I979.
The department refused. holding
out for a nationally renowned geo-
grapher as it had been promised.

In March I980. the dean sug-
gested a “new depart\mentalco,nfigu—
ration.” according to the
department. which it understood as
a merger with another FAS depart-
ment. The dean also at this time sug-
gested naming a chairman from
within the department. Again the
geography faculty refused.

But after debate concerning the
future ofthe department. in October
l98(). the geography department
faculty recommended that Muller be
considered as chairman. In
November I980. Muller met with
the faculty and the graduate stu-
dents. and a week later. they recom-
mended that the dean offer Muller
the chairmanship.

In December l98() and January
l98I. Muller said he and the dean

i“discussed“ the chairmanship.

although no negotiations took place
or offer made. ‘He recently charac-
terized the dean‘s actions as “unfor-
tunate” and said the “savings would
be minimal" if the university closed
the department.

But in March I98l. the dean with-
drew his earlier consideration of
Muller as a chairman. a department
spokesman said. and again told the
department to look for another
department with which to merge.

The dean also told the department
that it would be “prudent" not to
accept any more graduate students
and that the position of carto-
grapher Howard Ziegler would be
terminated as of July I. l98l.

On May 28. l98I. the dean issued
his second‘ termination proposal.
which is the basis of the geography
graduate student organization’s
grievance.

The graduate students further
attacked the dean on the grounds
that although his original proposal
was defeated by the committee
recommendations and his own
acceptance of these recommenda-
tions. the dean still implemented it.

In the I977 proposal. the dean
suggested that “tenure would not be
conferred upon any additional indi-
viduals in the department." No
tenure has been granted. He pro-
posed that “faculty who retire would
not be replaced. junior faculty
would not be reappointed.“ No
faculty members were replaced or
junior faculty reappointed. He pro-
posed that the “cartography facility

-of the department would either be

closed or be transferred." It was
closed.

Under the current proposal.
tenured faculty would be reassigned
to other departments.

The dean cited budgetary prob-
lems and the non-essentiality of the
department to the mission of the
university as his primary reasons for
the termination proposals.

rte said the department has “been
in a weakened condition for. a
number of_ years." citing the loss of
faculty. “failure to recruit a new
chairman. terminations of junior
faculty. a decrease in the number of
ma_jors and student credit hours
taught. and the fact that the depart-
ment «has not had a profound impact
on the profession. He also pointed
out in his current proposal that “the
very smallness allows for a termina-
tion with a minimum of problems."

Dean Rosenberg told the Univer-
.\'fl_l‘ Time.\'(.lunc I8.’ l98«l)that there
are only I8 or I9 of the 30 depart-
ments in FAS that are essential.
Outgoing chairman Kline said “that

tells you something about what the
future holds.“

The geography graduate student
organi'/ation believes that the dean‘s

judgment of them is "inaccurate."

because it was his responsibility to
upgrade them. which he failed to do.
according to the organi7ation.
Rosenberg defended his actions.
saying there are “general university
guidelines that govern the decision
that might be made for reorganiza-
tion or termination." such as the
budget. cost effectiveness. intrinsic
interest of subject _rnatter to stu-
dents. quality ofthe work done. and
essentially of the work of the
effected unit to other units.

He added that “the environment
in which we have to look at the
recommendations is considerably
different...the budgetary compul-
sion to cut back now is much more
cogent than in5I977."

Rosenberg said the yearly savings
could be S200.000.

Kline said he thinks the dean's
projections are high and that “some-
what over $I00.000 might be saved.“

Rosenbcrgsaid. “I did not invent
those failures-(the decline of the
department). nor did anyone else: it
wasjust in the nature of things. But
in view of the history we have to

An Important
Inclusion  

A recent report by the university's Senate Educ-
tional Policies Committee concluded that cases of
faculty misconduct should be dealt with as a faculty
probiem.

Professor Richard H. Pratt. speaking at last week’s
Faculty Assembly. said that department units should
consider among themselves how they want to handle
instances of abuse with their own departments. V

The Provost. Rhoten Smith. said that a system
should be created which provides for a process for
charges of alleged abuse.

Suggested items for the proposed code of conduct
are: , ‘

—-Meeting the first class on time.

«Conducting a full period class.

—-Arranging for adequate substitutes in the event of
absence. P

-Completing the full term by not giving early final
exams. . ‘ '

——Arriving at “class prepared to teach.

--Keeping office hours.

This discussion raises a number of issues for a con-
stituency that appears to have been left out: the
student. ‘ ‘ '

The student is the person affected most by faculty
abuses of the system. The student is the one who foots
a good percentage of the faculty members salary. And

adoption of policy. since each department may set up
its own standards. L
The concept of separate standards of conduct for
separate departments is an absurd and dangerous)
proposal from the student's point ofview. It allows for
inconsistency in the performance of the faculty ofthe
various departments and also in the student's expecta-
tions as he moves from one discipline to another in the
course of his undergraduate education. V
In’ addition. one is left wondering why a political
science professor. for example. mightbe able to come
unprepared to class when a biology teacher could not.
It see-ms on this point that if the department heads
are allowed to make up their own rules concerning
faculty conduct. then it should be the students peroga-
tive to -offer different tuition-rates for what he per-
ceives to be different levels of performance and
commitment to the ideal of education. .
Also. there is the problem of an objective hearing

procedure. The faculty. it seems. does not favor this
” idea.

\

Once again. the lack of a hearing procedure will
adversely affect the student. In the case ofa negligent
teacher. he or she benefits by being allowed to remain
on the staff of a department merely because that
department does not recognize his or her infraction.
Certainly the student does not benefit.

What is needed is a standard code ofconduct forthe
entire university for the protection of both students
and faculty. There is also a need for a publicly accessi-
ble and objective hearing‘ board to deal» with
complaints. / _

And there seems to exist a need for some show of

wconcern on the part of faculty and administrators for

what is. afterall. the object of their endeavor: the
student.

A Vote For

Dear Editor:

‘The curriculum reform proposal
for the College of Arts and Sciences
has been the topic of discussion
among many faculty members in
recent days. and decisive votes on it
are fast approaching. But the topic
has been absent from student dis-

’’course: in fact. many students are
uninformed on the entire subject.

From personal experience. lsfind
the least informed to be the non.-
technical majors. lt may be just as
well; they stand to change the least if
thistproposal is passed. While their
curriculum will be significantly
more structured. the few new added
courses willnot be much different in
texture than the courses they have
already. There are no hard-set
requirements for science. math
(beyond algebra) or computer pro-
gramming. skills necessary to every

. person of every major in today‘s —

technological society.

This leads to an obvious question:
‘Why/the emphasis on ARTS in the
College of Arts and Sciences‘? A trip

Why Use

Dear Editor:

The Oct.26 Pitt News devotes
much space to,an incident reported
to the campus police Oct. 3. This is a
subjective reaction on my part. but l
do feel a first-page story. continued
inside. and an editorial is much
space. However. 1 am puzzled by
your coverage.

From the story l have no doubt a
rape was reported. However. I am
left with doubts about ‘whether or

e not it actually happened.

By my count. the word “rape" is
mentioned 23 times in the story.
headlinesand editorial. However. 74
percent of the timct l 7 instances) it is
qualified with “alleged" or
“allegcdly.“ Once it is modified by

"actual”. once it is modified by “inci- - ‘

dent of" and four times ( I 7 percent)
it stands alone. . g_

Now. I know “alleged" is a very
fashionable word in the news media.
It is supposed to prevent libel suits.
As I understand the situation. how-
ever. it really doesn’t. But that is
irrelevant. Since no one stands
accused in the incident there would
seem to be no one who would sue the
paper for libel.

Thus. I am left in doubt. l)o the
authorities doubt that a rape
occurred‘? Is the Pitt student's story

suspect‘? Why the preponderance of

allegations over simple declarative
statements.’

The Flexiblesystem  

to the Placement Center would pres-
ent overwhelming evidence that the
most-offered. and best-paying jobs
are in the technical areas. If we are
being prepared for society. why are
we not prepared in the skills that
society values most‘?

One should not equate a technical
or scientific churrieuqlurnﬁwyithba train-
ing program. Just as an English
major acquires skills in English. a
Chemistry major must acquire skills
in Chemistry. Certainly. it is impor-
tant to be knowledgeable in a distri-
bution. of topics. but when a
Chemistry major grad uates. he must
be able to do Chemistry.

This leads to my final point.
regarding a specific problem with
the proposal. The pros and cons ofa
liberal education can be argued end-
lessly. but the injustice this proposal
does to scientific majors. speciﬁcally
physics. can not. A typical physics
major. with intentions of‘entering
graduate school. should complete
about 72 credits toward his B.S.
With the new proposals 30 or so

distribution credits. a physics major

The Word

Make no mistake about this —l
consider rape to be a serious prob-
lcm. I consider student safety to bea
serious topic. But I consid'erTyour'

would only have I8 odd credits as
clectives-- barely enough for a
minor. given as l2()-credit academic
career. and not much freedom)-for a
mature. adult student.

liam not sure how other scientific

.majors compare with physics‘. I

invite further letters of response. But

 isycleariplfwa curriculum proposal

can not be made that does not slight F
against any one department or inter-
est. then none should be passed. The
entire faculty should be responsible
enough to see that no major is put
under an excessive and prohibitive
burden. while in search of a “liberal
education.“ '

Personally. I. like the present sys-
tcm; tailor-made to eachindividual
and flexible to a changing society. I

would not have come to Pitt if this

new curriculum proposal was in
operation four years ago.

Your coverage in the Oct. 2o edi-
tion of The Pitt Neu'.s'ofthc rape ofa
Pitt student was typical|_\:sexist in
approach. For example. the rape
was consistently referred to as the
“allcged“ rape. Why‘? Is there some

question as to whether the incident-
’ actually took place‘? I could find no

mention in the article of why the
rape is only “allcged" to have hap-
pened instead ofactually happening.

_ ‘Secondly. accompanying the article

land also at the.cnd of it) are the
typical warnings to female students
not to be out late at night. l-)o you
know that rape also occurs in broad
daylight in supposedly “safe“ situa-
tions? Along with C\ cry reporting of
a rape should be an accoinpanying
article of warningto M E.\' that these
assaults are unacceptable and will
nottbe tolerated. A swift. severe pun=
ishment under the law‘ for rape
would do more to prc\cnt rape than
the constant warnings to women to
stay off the streets at any hour of the
day or niiiht. l.et‘S Pl" “W '"°5P““-“"

Fighting Off-Campus
Housing Problems

Legal Awareness:

Monitoring the Situation

For many. the ordeal was over
when they signed the lease and paid
the security deposit.

For other students living in off-
campus housing.» however. the
ordeal never ends. A

This second group of students is
faced with problems that range from
clogged sinks to fire hazards. in one
case. a landlord beats up his tenants.

According to the Legal Aware-
ness Committee (LAC). a l4-
member standing committee of the
Student Government Board. a stu-

‘dent can take several courses of

actionrin waging a battle against off-

’ campus housing problems.

s

The foremost off-campus housing
problem this time of the year.
according to LAC. is a landlord’s
making of repairs to .a rental
property."

According to one Pennsylvania

law. if repair work makes it neces- _

sary for a tenant to move out of the .

rental property. even ifonly tempor-
arily. the tenant‘s responsibility to
pay rentis suspended for that time.

Another state law. however. states
that if a landlord is not making
repairs as quickly as a tenant would

like. the tenant cannot automati- '
~ cally withhold rent.

“If your landlord refuses to make
needed repairs. you should send a
letter to him explaining the repairs
needed.“ says LAC member John
Waite. “ln.the letter. state who is to
‘make the repairs and when. Then.
most important of all. have the letter
copied and certified.“

Another
Wasek. points out that fourvstudents
followed this procedure last year
and took it one step further. When
the landlord refused to make the
needed repairs. the students paid for
them and ded-ucted the cost from the
next month’s rent.

“The most important thing to
remember when using this proce-
dure is to have receipts proving the
exact cost of _the needed repairs."
says Wasek. “Another thing is that
after the repairs are made and
deducted from the rent. you cannot
-reverse them when you move out."

To avoid any legal complications
that may result with this “repair and
deduct” procedure.‘ LAC recom-
mends that a tenant call the Allegh-
eny Health Department and have a
health inspector visit the apartment.

“if the inspectors report finds
your apartment is in violation. you
can get an escrow account card from

.the health department." explains

Waite. “This permits you to legally
put your rent check in‘ an escrow
account until the needed repairs are
made.”

LAC member. John

Although the fear of eviction
stops many ' off-campus residents
from filing complaints against land-
lords. it shouldn’t. According to a
state law. it is illegal fora landlord to
evict a tenant for exercising his legal
rights.

Security .
Deposit

Another common problem for
people living in rental properties is
the return of the security deposit.

“During September and October
we were flooded with security dep-
osit complaints from students who
said landlords were withholding
them without legitimate reasons.”
says LAC member Carla Taylor.
“Overall. we tend to get the mafority

of these complaints at the beginning

of the fall term and at the end ofthe
winter term."

According to Taylor. students
with off-campus housing problems
are sometimes referred to the two
lawyers that LAC has on retainer.

‘They are also to file complaints with

the magistrate. This procedure
proved successful for two students
last year who sued their landlord for
their security deposit and won.

“The landlord withheld the secur-

ity deposit bywriting it off as dam-
ages.” explains Wasek. “The
students took it to court and won. It
wasn’t too hard. especially when the
landlord charged $4.50 to putty a
nail hole and repaired a china closet
that was never used." ’

Wasek points out that not all stu-
dents have the time or money totake
a security-deposit problem to court.
Instead. he suggests that students
when moving- into an apartment
make a checklist ofeverything inthe
apartment and record the apart-
ment‘s condition on the checklist. A
third party should witness this. and
then a copy of the checklist should
be given to the landlord.

“The Landlord-Tenant Act states

that your landlord must return the

full security deposit within 30 days
after the lease ends. or supply you

with aniitemized list ofdamages plus

the balance of your deposit.“
explains Wasek. "But you must
leave a forwarding address in
writing.”

Wasek adds that if the landlord
does not fulfill his obligation. the
tenant has the right to sue for double
the amount of the security deposit.

Often. disputes between tenant
and landlord can be avoidcd'when
each knows his rights and duties.
which should be in writing.

“No one should ever move into an
apartment without signing a lease.“
warms Taylor. “it often turns out to
be the tenant‘s weapon.“

The Lease

Another important thing a tenant
should do is obtain a copy of a
signed lease from the landlord.
While it sounds simple enough. it is
not always the easiest thing to d_0. as
one Pitt student found out.

“My roommate and l have called
our landlady at least seven times
since September asking for a copy of

« the lease." she explains. “Each time

she says she's putting it in the mail."
“The thing is. she's got us in a
corner since we don‘t have a Copy of
the lease. For all we know she could
have changed it." 
She could have. but it wouldn‘t be

if binding. According to onelaw. both

the landlord and tenant must agree
to a change in a lease ‘that has
alreadybeen signed. “

Often a tenant. especially in a stu-
dent's case. will carelessly sign a
leas'e"witlfoiit reading‘ it thoroughly
because he is glad to have taken care
of another hassle. Maybe now is the
time the lease should be pulled out of
the drawer and re-read to check for
certain clauses. y ‘

A tenant should be aware that
some leases contain a sub-letting res-

triction that prohibits anyonc other »

than those on the lease to move in.
This clause could be responsible for
the rude awakening those unaware
tenants planning to moveihome for
the -summer may experience in
April. ' A
Another clause a tenant should
look for is the distraint clause. which

allows the landlord to sell a tenant‘s

personal property in_ case of non-
payment of rent. This is now illegal
and such a clause should be deleted
immediately. -

However. two clauses penalizing
late rent payments that are legal are
the rent acceleration clause and for-
feiture clause.

The rent acceleration clause per— -

mits the landlord to demand the
entire amount due. that is. the rent
for the number ofmonths remaining
on the lease. as insurance against
late payment.

The forfeiture clause. on the other
hand. allows the landlord to con-
sider late payment a breach oflease.

Breach
of Lease

A lease is breached when either
the tenant or landlord _fails to
observe his commitments under the
agreement. .

if the landlord files a complaint
against the tenantifor any breach of
the lease. the tenant is served with a

notice that requires him to present a
defense at a hearing with a Justice of
the Peace or magistrate.

A tenant should then seek help
from such sources as LAC. private
counsel. the Office of Off—Campus
Housing. or Neighborhood Legal
Services. K _

dents who qualify for federal assist-

complaint. may be appealed within
20 days ofthe Common Pleas Court.
if. it is not. the decision’ is final.

“The court eviction process can
put a student out on the street if it is
not appealed." explains Waite. “or if
the student does not defend himself
at the hearing.“

Eviction « -C

Eviction. Just the mention ofthe
word makes some tenants shudder.

However. the only circumstances
under which a landlord may evict a
tenant are: when the tenant term of
the lease ends; when the tenant
breaches the lease: or when the
tenant refuses to pay rent.

Before a landlord can evict a
tenant he must notifx him by regis-
tered letter or post the order" by the
court granting permission to evict.

“If the landlord doesn't obtain
permission from the courts to evict
and he changes the locks. or has the
utilities shut off. the tenant has the
right to sue the landlord for damages
suffered because of this." explains
LAC member Taylor.

The Listing

Mary Lou Sosso has taken Pitt‘s
Off-Campus Housing Office
(OCHO) from a file box in I975 toa
full—fledged office that served over
l9.000 people in I980. "

“When I first came here. OCHO
consisted of a file box kept in Pitt‘s

Housing Office.“ says Sosso. coordi- A

nator ofOCHO. “l started this office
from scratch."

Since Sosso took»
OCHO has moved twice
to a larger office
quartered in the’baser_nent ofSchen-
ley Hall.

Today. OCHO has a full—time
staff of three and provides housing
information to students attending
Pitt. Carnegie-Mellon and the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh.

According to Sosso. there are
over 2.000 -landlords listing with the
OCHO this year. In addition to its
free listing service. the -office also
provides a roommate service and a
telephone service.

“In September‘. more than 800

the reins.
"each time

students came through here to the’

o

and is now head--

temporary facilities Bell Telephone
Company had set up." says Sosso.
“We provided a one-stop service and
saved each student whopicked up a
phone here $l2.‘‘ ’

Although Sosso would like
OCHO to take on a broader role and»
become more of an advocate. she
doesn‘t see it happening.

“l would like to increase our staff
and to investigate problems." she
says. “But with the current budget
cutbacks within 1 the university. I
don‘t think it will happen.“

Housing problems Sosso would

like to see investigated are apart-
ments that violate building. health.
and fire codes.

“The university itself is not in a
position to approve apartments. nor
is this office with a staff of three
people." Sosso says. “The inv_es_tiga-
tion is left up to the city.‘‘,.

The city is not always an ideal
in\estigator. According to Sosso. a
North Oakland apartment listed
with OCHO had a fire in its walls

“When the landlord heard we had

ening to sue." says Sosso. “Back
then. the only listings we could

’ comply with state laws."

While the OCHO now reserves
the right to remove listings. Sosso
thinks a lot more could be done. She
suggests the formation of a com-

from the fees it charges landlords
($l0) and real estate agencies ($50)
for unlimited listings for one year.

There is very little scrutiny of lis-
ters by OCHO.

“The only regulation for listing /

with the ‘office is to sign a non-
discrimination agreement." Sosso
says. “However. as I said before. the
office does reserve the right to
remove listings at any time."
Indirectly. it is the students who
scrutinize listers with their written

‘comments kept on file with the’

apartment listings. This. however.
does not always prevent students
from renting places that have
received negative student
comments. 5

“Students often want to find an
apartment in April before they go
home for the summer and are some-
times careless in
explains Sosso. “Other students wait
until September to find a place and
are desperate for a place to live."

Although some ofthe housing
problems students face are caused
by their own carelessness. Sosso has
not seen any improvement in the
overall quality ofhousingduring her
six years here. i

“The problem is not being
solved." she says. “When I first came
here in I975. I tried to convince stu--
dents to move out into new areas.
like South Hills and North Hills..but
the majority of students want to stay
here in Oakland.“

According to Sosso. for the same
price a student pays to live in Oak-
land. he or she could get a much
nicer apartment in the outlying
Pittsburgh area.

Apartments in Oakland generally
run five percent to I2 percent higher
than similar apartments in Shady-
side and Squirrel Hill.

According to an OCHO survey.
an average furnished one-bedroom
apartment costs $299 a month. while
a similar apartment costs $265 a
month in Shadyside and $285 in
Squirrel Hill. ’

_“Students pay for the convenience
of living in Oakland." says Sosso. “I
don‘t think rent increases are going
to change this. either."

Because more students are living
off-campus. Sasso says that housing
in Oakland has gotten tighter while
its quality has declined.

“More and more. four students
are living in apartments designed to
accommodate two people comforta-
bl_v.” she says. “The quality has not‘
declined drastically. but the lack of
upkeep is evident."

their choice." «

Does the Univer-
sity Fit In?

These days. students aren‘t the
only ones concerned about the qual-
ity of off-campus housing here in
Oakland. I

KDKA-TV newswoman Patti
Burnsrecently reported on the prob-
lem. Her series of reports gave the
rest of Pittsburgh a glimpseof the
apartments with leaking ceilings and
cockroaches that some Pitt students
have to call home during the school
year and raised questions about the
university’s» responsibility in this
situation.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar stated
the university’s position at last
month’s Senate Council -meeting
when he expressed concern. but said
that there is “no legal way to moni-
tor housing that is not owned by the
university.”

“The university maintains a list of
off-campus housing that has met
certain standards.” he explained. “If
we find out that the standards are’

not being maintained. such housing ‘

is removed from the list.”

But Pitt Professor ofSocial Work
Anne Jones. who mentioned com-
plaints about off-campus housing at
the council meeting. heard. ‘them
first-hand from students and raises
another valid point. 1 ‘

“While I realize the university is
not in the assessment business. I
‘think it does have an obligation to
students because it does not provide
university housing for all those stu-
dents desiring it." she said.

9 .
According, to Jay Roling. Pitt's
assistant vice chancellor for public

_ affairs. it would be to Pitt’s advan-

tage in attracting both students and
faculty to have a nice residential sec-
tor around the university.

'“The university supports the strict
enforcement of health and safety
codes for off-campus housing. How-
ever. if it were done today. we’d find
4.000 students out on the street."
Roling said in a recent interview.
“The only way this could be done is
if alternative housing were
available.”

Posvar also said at the meeting
that the university is trying to
develop more housing to meet the
housing demand.

“We are trying to develop sonic

housing of our own. but plans to
build town houses in*South Oakland
were turned down." Posvar said.
“Our development of the Forbes
Nursing Home into a housing unit
has. however. been a success. It has
proved to be beneficial for the
neighborhood.”

But in another neighborhood not
far from Forbes Hall. a Pitt student
is still waiting for his landlord to
make good on a promise to furnish
his apartment and fix his stove.

“After paying a security deposit.
signing a lease. and agreeing to a
more expensive apartment because
the first apartment wasn‘t in living
C0ndiIi0n. I expect the landlord to
do something." he sai_d in disgust.

Fire Report  

It‘s been almost a year since a fire g

destroyed the Saybrook apartment

y building on Craft Avenue leaving its

sixty residents homeless and over
two years since a fire swept through
the “Chance R" disco killing two
tenants who lived above.

According to Pittlsburgh‘s Fire
Prevention Office the bestmeasures
against such a catastrophe are pre-
ventative. Just thisiyear. the office
added an ordinance requiring the
installation of smoke detectgrs in.‘
multiple-family dwellings. Further.

the office says for it to be most effec-.

tive. the detector should be installed
in a hallway or as close to a -sleeping
room as possible.

Other suggestions by the office
include knowing where the‘fire
extinguishers are. and if they are‘
missing or empty. the tenant should ,
ask the

landlord to have them

 

e  19 re hat desoyed South Oakland’s
Saybrook apartment building.

replaced or serviced.

Also the tenant should watch out
for the accumulation ofcombustible

materials in or around the building. I

Ifthe tenant suspects the landlord
is in violation of a fire code. the
tenant should request that it be cor-
rected or call the Fire Prevention
Office at 255-2866 to request a check
by a fire inspector. I

If a tenant is caught in a burning
building. the most important thing is
to notify other tenants and leave._

Ifia tenant  trappediin a burning
building. the Fire Prevention Office

stresses that the tenant put as many _

barriers between himself and the fire
as possible and to stay low. A tenant
is advised to get to a window and not
to hide under a bed or in a closet

because the firefighters may not find_

him or her.

because there were a lot ofques-
tions about us." he continued.

“Now. if we keep working. we

can finish No. l. It's nice because
it gives us a chance to control our
own destiny."

If the top spot is to remain
Pitt‘s destiny, the team will have
to deal with the pressure that
comes with being No. I--the
pressure not to make mistakes.
and above all. not to lose theNo.
l spot now that they have it.

As Sherrill admitted. the fear
of losing can be as dangerous as
any opponent on the field.

“its very evident at any level.
the more you win. the more pres-
sure you have. You can con-
sciously say you'll be as reckless
as you have been in the past. but
subconciously. in the back of
your mind. there‘s a little guy
saying. ‘Don't lose. don't lose!’

.— ‘:You can end up playing not

to lose instead of playing to win.
We have to stay reckless and not
be afraid to make mistakes."

Though many players said
they don’t feel any additional
pressure since rising to the No. l.
others admit it can prey on a
player's mind. If you let it.

“The pressure is on now...but
there‘s no pressure if you don’t
let it affect you."said Pitt corner-
back Troy Hill. “Wejust have to
keep doing the same things and
not look ahead." I

The unofficial news that Pitt
had taken over the No. l spot.

PittBegins with
  PSU Diving Invite

By SEAN BARNES

The annual Penn State lnvita-
tional Diving meet will open the
l98l-82 Panther diving season Fri-
day and Saturday for Pitt Coach
Julian Krug and his male and female
divers.

The meet features the best teams
in the Eastern division striving
against each other for the first time
since last season’s Eastern and
National Championships in‘ late
March. ‘

Although the rivals will be many.
Krug expectsthe best competitionto
be among West Virginia.iPenn State
and Pitt. PSU will return Dale Dim-
itrzak. who trainsgon Pitt‘s AAU
summer team under Krug.

“They’ve lost Craig Brown (due to
graduation) and Joe Greenwell (due
to tranferral). but Dale is in his
home _pool and will prove tough to
beat.“ Krug said. Dimitrzak placed
fifth and seventh on the one- and
three-meter boards at Easterns last

year.
Pitt has returning l98l Eastern
one-meter champ Mike Minik.

Minik also placed third on thethree-
metcr at the Easterns. and was
named l98l Eastern Diver of the
-Year, so he is the dinite favorite this
year. '

Minik. a’ junior. said he is anx-
iously awaiting this weekend's invi-
tational. because it will allow him an
-early season inspection of his up-
coming competition during the
dual-meet portion ofthe season. The
new recruits will be of special inter-
est to watch. '

For Pitt. Krug is very pleased with
freshman Shawn McLane out of
Virginia.

He was one of the top four high
school recruits in the country this
year." says Krug. “His home state;
Virginia. wanted him. lndiana. Ohio

‘ State. Miami. SMU. ..... ..I’m glad he

chose our team.”

recently. Krug will have towait fora
doctor’s opinion to decide if
McLane can dive Friday.

Pitt has two more talented divers
in Bob Lambert and sophomore
Rex Nordheimer. For Lambert. it
will be his lasrtrip to PSU since he,
graduates in December. Lambert
has a lot ofcollege-level,experience
and should live up to his Eastern
finalist standing in the three-meter

V ' competition. ’
 Nordheimer could be a bit shaky.
not having had much real collegiate
diving experience. Krug and Nord-

«I

heimer‘s fellow Panther divers. how-
ever. see a lot of talent in
Nordheimer.

“He is a very improvingidiver“
says Minik. “HE’s learned a lot from
diving at Pitt under Krug." ;d

WVU recruited well this year and
will show four divers. including
Dann Grindel. their new recruit out
of Butler. Grindcl was a WPIAL
record-setter in high school and
Krug. who also tried recruiting
Grindel. expects him to make an
excellent opening for the
Mountaineers.

Returning Lady Panther divers
include Eastern finalists Holly Sluss
and Lisa Huey. Both girls are very
strong on the three-meter board "and
aie versatile one-meter divers. Krug
has one freshman recruit. Yvonne
Johnson. who dove on Pitt‘s AAU
summer team. .7‘;

For Johnson. it will be a tough
opening college meet since she and
her fellow divers will be facing the
best in the East.

If Harvard. Princeton and Penn
State show all of their new divers.
Pitt will face a challenging opener.
PSU had a good recruiting year.
while Princeton and"Harvard have
excellent returning divers.

Harvard's best recruit. .lcnnifer
Goldberg from nearby Chartiers
Valley. was a WPIAL recordsctter
and trained under Krug in the
summer. so she is well aware ofwhat
Pitt will be sending in competition to
PSU. " 

Krug islooking forward to seeing
the new as well as the experienced
college divers in the East this early in
the season. As with his male divers.
the girls will see all of them again in
competition at least once during reg-
ular season. and again for the East-
erns and the National qualifying
meets in March.

Last year. Pitt‘s women divers
took l4 out of2O possible first places
in dual-meet competition. and in the

» six they missed. they landed second-

place finishes. Krug has been the
Eastern Champion diving coach
ever since he took over as head div-
ing coach in'l979. Pitt stands an
excellent chance ofwinning the mew
if all goes well. ‘

The next appearance of Pitt‘s div-
ing squads will be at the Pitt-Kent
State swim meet at Trees Pool Nov. T
l3. The Kent State meet will be Pitt‘s
only home meet this season until the
Panthers. Eastern champs for the
last six years. host Easterns at Trees
Pool in March.

Eastern 8 Future on Hold

The Eastern 8 basketball confer-
ence holds its fall meeting tomor-
row. but no action is expected to be
taken on the key issue facing the
league: future commitments.

With the increasing likelihood of
the new formation of a new. all-
sports Eastern conferen-e that
includes three Eastern 8 schools-
Pitt. West Virginia and Rutgers--J
the chances of future one or two-
year commitments to the Eastern 8
from any of its current members are
slim.

The remaining five schools-
Rhode lsland..George Washington.
Massachusetts. Duqucsne and St.
Bonaventure» will probably join

Pitt. WVU and Rutgers and delay a _

decision on commitments to the
Eastern 8 until the future ofthe new

conference becomes clearer.

Pitt Athletic Director Cas Mys-
linski said he expects the schools to
wait until early December. at least.
to decide whether or not to sting‘
with the Eastern 8. All eight schools ‘W
are committed through the l98l
l982 season.

After that. the future of the East-
ern 8 look dim. And short-lived. ln
addition to basketball. the new con-
ference will offer a framework for
non-revenue sports

There is a good chance that a foot-
ball bowl tie-in. probably with the
Fiesta Bowl. can’ be worked out.
League proponents are also optimis-
tic about a basketball television con-
tract. lt all adds up to more potential
revenue for the schools.

One of the shortcomings of the
Eastern 8 has been its failure to land

_ a regular-season television contract.

According to Dunn. it was due to
the intensity oftheir soccer schedule.

“Back home. soccer is year

social life. Most of your friends are
soccer players because you’re always
around them. Keith and I hit it off
from the start."

Dunn and Reinhard came from a

Heismanunlikely;

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Some thoughts:
Jackie Sherrill was in New York

yesterday to push Dan Marino for

the Heisman Trophy. He might as
well forget it. for this year anyway.

Following Marino’s un-Heisman-
like performances against Syracuse
and Boston College. thejunior quar-
terback has about as much chance of
winning the Heisman as Gerry Faust
of Notre Dame has of winning the
coaeh of the year award.

Seriously, Marino, with his 21
touchdown" passes. had the creden-
tials until the past two weeks. His six
interceptions against mediocre com-
petition and Southern Cal's Marcus
AIIen’s continued excellence
reduced Marino’s chances to slim
and none. The USC tailback. espe-
cially after last week‘s sensational
282-yard performance against pre-
viously undefeated Washington
State. has a virtual lock on the
award.

If he should falter. something he
has not done—witness his sixth 200-
yard game- Herschel Walker is
probably next‘in line.

Marino‘s credentials will put him
third on the list with next year possi-
bly being his Heisman-winning year.

together, their pressing has wrecked
havoc. but.don’t count it during the

When a hockey team has to go

tournament. the team has troubles.
The Pitt Hockey Club had just that
problem in the St. Bonaventure

lost to eventual champion Buffalo

Saturday. Pitt came back the next '
day only to get routed in the conso-
lation game by I)uquesne 8-4.

The first fi\e minutes set up what

Defenseman Mark Brown was
ejected from the entire tournament
for butt—ending with his stick. Since
defenseman Roger Paul was out
with a wrist in_iury..the Panthers
were left with only three
defensemen.

Despite this and a two goal deficit.
Pitt rallied to tie the score at four all
only to lose on a Buffalo State goal
with only 4l seconds remaining in
-the game.

“I have a lot offaith in the team."
said C7emerda. “We showed a lot
when we came back against Buffalo
State. but losing the way we did was
heartbreaking. We were in a very
physical game. and that took a lot

‘ out of us when we pla ed Du uesnc.

   

 

 

The Pitt Hockey Club got a cool reception in Its season opener at the St. Bonaventure

both physically and emotionally."
Czemerda commented.

Czemerda expects a much differ~
ent performance when his team faces
Duquesne Saturday at the Civic
Arena.

“First of all. we will have both

Mark and Roger back in action.“
said C7emerda. “We should be emo-
tionally up. since Duqucsne is a big
rival."

Czemerda also feels the club has a
good chance to be successful this
season.

“This team has plenty of talent.
but it isjust a matter of putting this
talent together." said Czemerda.

But the conditions at Pitt don’t
seem to really bother these two
young men. Both are contributing to
the Panthers successful 8-5 season.

and has started in several games.
Dunn’s size. 5-l l. I63 pounds. and
excellent speed. for a defenseman.
aid him-in his position.

“My job is to keep the opposing
team from scoring.” explained
Dunn. “l’m suppose to make things
happen. l enjoy playing fullback
because if the defense plays well. we
could have "a shutout and l liketosee
shutouts. The chances are better that

' we’ll win.”

Reinhard is a 5-7. I40 pound half-
back who has seen a lot ofaction in
the midfield. Reinhard enjoys run-
ning and the midfield’s the place to

do it. ’ _

“l like it in the midfield." said
Reinhard. ‘‘It’s fun. There’s more
running than other positions. You’re
a lot more involved in the game.
You’re a key man. You’re always
involved in the play. whether you‘re
playing offense or defense."

Coming from an area that has
almost 4()()() youths involved in
soccer. these two blonds are making
names for themselves on a young
and talented Pitt squad. And they’re
enjoying it. ~

“l’m having a good time.” said
Reinhard. “l wan-t to play the best
soccer possible for me. l‘ve grown up

with it and l like the competitive:

ness. l‘ve met a lot of neat people.“
‘‘I’m having a great time." said
Dunn. laughing. “Soccer is enjoya-
ble and it helps me to keep in shape.
Its a way to meet a lot of people.
Being halfway successful in a sport
makes you feel‘ like someone."
