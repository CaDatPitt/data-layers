Pitt bookstore returns to old location, boastsnew features

Mahita Gajanan
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

After a yearlong renovation, Pitt’s book- I

store is open and ready for the fall semester
under a new name. I

The University Store on Fifth opened
at the University Book Center’s previous
Fifth Avenue location Monday. In July of
last year, the store moved to a building near
the corner of Forbes and Meyran avenues
to allow construction and expansion within
the store.

According to the. store’s manager, Kris-
tin Hopkins, the store will host a_ grand-
opening celebration in October. For now,

the store is open and operating while giv-
ing the staff time to hire employees, ﬁll the
store with books and work out any kinks
in its operation.

“I’m really impressed,” junior Meghana
Patil said of the renovations. “It looks like
a real bookstore.” ' '

Now the newly renovated Book Center
is more than just a place to hunt down text-
books for class. There are now sections for
children’s books and leisure reading, open
areas for customers to sit and read books
and a merchandise area ﬁlled with Pitt gear.
According to Hopkins, the renovations in-
volved ridding the storeof its ofﬁce area
and expanding back so that the store would

wrap around the quad.

Injuly 2012‘, Pitt’s Board of Trustees ap-
proved more than $9.4 million for the Book
Center renovations. At the time, the money
was expected to come from Pitt’s auxiliary
reserves. The renovations are the ﬁrst for
the bookstore since it opened in 1960.

Pitt spokeswoman Cara Masset said that
the renovations cost $9.5 million in total.
Pitt plans to lease the temporary bookstore

location on Forbes Ave. to Verizon Wireless. -

Junior Gordon Wyrostek explored the
new book store’s layout on his ﬁrst day as
a Computer Services and System Develop-
ment employee and commended the reno-

vations.

“I think the new inclusions are really
awesome, and I think people will enjoy get-
ting everything in one place,” Wyrostek said.

The ﬁrst ﬂoor now includes a CSSD lo-
cation, a cafe and a printing press where
students can print their own books.

Hopkins said the store saw a steady
stream of customers on'its ﬁrst day, though
employees are still in the process of stock-
ing bookshelves and unpacking textbooks.

Students are happy that the Book Center
is once again easily accessible.

“It’s deﬁnitely better that it’s back in its
original spot,” junior Felix Nguyen said. “It’s
the center: of campus.” I

Subletting a viable option for
students in summer

Danielle Fox
Staff Writer

In April, Kaylie Springer, a self-proclaimed
travel junkie, discovered that she had landed
the internship of her dreams in Berlin for the
summer through Pitt’s College of Business
Administration’s International Internship
Program.

But, before the senior English writing and
political science major could begin practicing
her “hallo, guten morgen,” Springer had to
unburden herself of the remaining months
left on her South Oakland apartment’s lease.

Thus, Springer began the search for a sub-
letter.

When someone sublets, he or she leases a
property from alandlord ora realtor and then
leases it to another person — the subletter.
This is also called subleasing. j

Subletting is a common practice among
college students who live near campus during
the school year but then move away once sum-
mer begins. Pitt’s Department of Oﬁ'—Campus
Living even offers an online service in which

students can list the apartment or house they ’

are looking to sublease. There are currently
256 listings on the website, with properties
in Oakland and other surrounding neighbor-
hoods.

Springer originally found her subletter

through a mutual organization at Pitt, but _

found herself searching once again.

“When the ﬁrst person I thought was sub-
letting from me bailed at the last minute, it was
a huge headache. I had two days to ﬁnd some-
one before leaving the country,” Springer said.

But things‘ worked out. Springer listed her
apartment on Craigslist and was able to ﬁnd a

subletter, saving herself the nearly $2,000 in

rental costs she would’ve had to pay had she
not subleased. I
_ While some students like Springer need to
leave Pittsburgh for the summer, others need
a place to stay. Pitt students Liz Sadoski, Au-
tumn Puhac, Alex Sieman and David DeLeon
all subleased this summer and said they had
positive experiences. '
This was DeLeon’s second consecutive year
subletting. The junior urban studies and po-

‘ litical science major is currently subletting in _
North Oakland.

The ﬁrst year, DeLeon said, he ran into
trouble when his sublease was up before he was
able to move into his university housing. The
future tenants of the apartment had agreed to
allow him to stay an additional week but then
changed their minds at the last second, forcing
DeLeon to relocate and stay with ﬁiends in

Shadyside until University buildings opened‘_

for the year.

“While my experiences haven’t been
100-‘percent smooth, I’ve been lucky to have
landlords [or] companies that were not the
nightmares thatl hear people have dealt with,”
DeLeon said in a message via Facebook. “I
honestly think anytime you do sublet, you are
taking a risk as the actual tenant. But as the
subtenant, your experience is going to depend
on the landlord, so it’s hit or miss.”

DeLeon’s landlord at his ﬁrst sublet re-
quired him to sign a subletting contract and
leave a security deposit.

This is a fairly common practice because

. though the original tenant of a property tem-

porarily leaves the premises, he or she is still
responsible to the landlord for anything that
might happen while the subtenant is living in

 president of activist group  
envisions changed message

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

Ryan Branagan, who led a pro—Palestinian
campus advocacy group at Pitt until he
graduated in the spring, said that more
than once, he ran into people who ques-
tioned how much he knew about the region
because he is neither Israeli nor Palestin-
ian and because he has never been there.

“But somebody like Mahmoud [Ya-
c_oub],” Branagan said of his successor,
who is of Palestinian descent. “He’s been-

there. He’s had an AK-47 in his face at a 4

checkpoint.”

Yacoub, a senior English writing and
philosophy major, said that when he vis-
ited the West Bank in 2008, he and other
members of his family were stopped at an
Israeli security checkpoint. Passengers
had to get off the bus and walk through a
metal detector. _

Yacoub, who was 15 years old at the
time, helpedhis 11-year-old brother with
their bags as the boy walked through the
metal detector. The soldiers got angry and

started yelling at both of the boys. When ’

Yacoub continuedhelpingwhis brother, the
soldiers pointed assault weapons at them

. because they appeared to feel that the two

boys were taking too long to pass through
the metal detector. ' *

' Now, as president of Students for-Jus-
tice in Palestine, Yacoub wants to educate
the public about the grievances of the Pal-
estinian people. He plans to implement

‘changes in the organization in hopes of

increasing the group’s advocacy efforts
in order to enact change in Israel and the
Palestinian territory. But, although Ya-

coub said he wants SJP to be seen less as a
radical protest organization and more as
a human rights organization, he said has
no interest in open dialogue with campus
organizations that support Israel.
Branagan said that even though he has
researched the issues related to the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict extensively, many op-

ponents of the organization questioned. .
. his credibility simply ‘on the basis that

he was not Israeli nor Palestinian, and
has never visited the region. Although
he ‘disagreed with this criticism, he said

opponents could not raise these same ob-

jections against Yacoub.

Structural Changes

Yacoub said he would make SJP more
inclusive by running the club alongside
officers and other members. He said that
he respected Branagan’s work as an activ-
ist, but he wanted to focus more on raising
awareness about the issues related to the
Palestinian cause. But Yacoub also said
Branagan, who was president of SJP for.
two years before he graduated, was known
too much to outsiders as the “face” of the
pro-Palestinian movement at Pitt.

Although Branagan agreed with Ya-
coub’s plan to make the club more par-
ticipatory, he denied that he intentionally
took the spotlight. ' '

“Some of our opponents focused their
eyes on me instead of what I was saying,”
Branagan said. He also acknowledged that
at one point he became burnt out when he
tried to take on too much organizational
responsibility by himself. ‘

Branagan agreed that SJP would prob-

Organization serves children of area incarcerated parents

‘Matt Singer
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

After 10 years of advocating the rights of Al-
legheny County children whose parents were
jailed, the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Founda-
tion is wrapping up its decadelong work and
looking forward to a new initiative.

PCGF is the offspring of what used to be
the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center. Upon
formation, the PCGF, a 5o1(c) tax—exempt non-

- proﬁt, began its work to better the emotional

stability of Allegheny County’s children.
Current PCGF Executive Director Pam
Golden said that it should be understood
that the foundation does not provide direct
services, but rather, is an_organization that
funds, advocates and facilitates collaboration
on behalf of children. -
“The ﬁrst thing they did was help organiza-
tions to help children build the competence for
copingwith emotional reality,” Claire Walker,
the former executive director of PCGF, said.

' But, after its initial work, PCGFwanted
people in the county to better the goals of the
foundation and chose to simplify its next ini-
tiative to, as Walker phrased it, “something
that people could understand on the street.”

Thus, the “Advocating for Children Whose
Parents are Incarcerated” program began and
ultimately extended to a 10-year course of
action “to convene, to advocate and to give
small targeted advances” to organizations that

worked toward bettering the lives of children
whose parents were in jail.

“We see children as our future, and despite
whatever feelings people may have about the
needs of incarcerated parents, the children
are innocent, and they deserve the chance
to develop into emotionally and physically
healthy, productive citizens,” Charlotte Brown,
PCGF’s board president and an associate pro-
fessor of psychiatry and health and community
systems at the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine, said. -

PCGF performed extensive research on the
topic, making the public aware of the stark
realities the affected children, who make up
12 to 15 percent of all children in the county,
face. These children’s families will feel the

economic drain of a wage earner for multiple T

generations, while the children themselves
might be ostracized by their peers and nega-
tively affected by the loss of close, functioning
bonds with a parent.

Of the changes PCGF brought about
through this program, many improved the
programs within Allegheny County jails, and
the foundation has worked to lessen the sever-
ity of the conditions for prisoners who are
discharged. p

Jails’ discharge centers now ensure that
prisoners leaving the jail can make a phone
call home. Before this change, which PCGF
sought, the typical release occurred between
2:30 and 4:30 a.m. with no possibility for the

——
I

  
 
    
 

‘discharged prisoners to call their families.

They were put out as soon as the authorities
processed their paperwork. ‘

“And the guys, they said, ‘We get‘ out and
the only guy waiting for us is the dealer,’ and
women said, ‘We know how to make money
Downtown,’” Walker said.

But now the discharge period has been
lengthened to°48 hours, giving those dis-
charged time to make accommodations for
their return. Additionally, there are now
programs in place to ensure that discharged
prisoners have a place to stay, something to eat
and resources at their disposal to meet their
needs upon leaving the jail.

Furthermore, families now know when p

their loved ones are coming home thanks to
the PCGF, whose research found that one of
the most traumatic elements of the process for
children was not knowing what time their par-

ents would return, which could render them i

unable to be home to greet them. '

Kathy McCauley says that although many
of these programs seem like they would obvi-
ouslybe in place, in some cases they werenever
implemented. However, as PCGF contributed
to the work of thejail Collaborative, McCauley
says that the foundation “really hammered
[these programs] through.” '

McCauley is a coordinating member of the ..

Allegheny County Jail Collaborative, which
is a product of the combined efforts of lo-
cal government, the county jailsystem and

several other organizations, including PCGF,
which supplies particularly valuable input and
research on family services for the jail‘ Col-
laborative. _h . .

The Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.—
based nonpartisan think tank that evaluates
social and economic policy research, is cur-
rently conducting studies on the efficacy of
the Jail Collaborative’s work, and the results
of this research will underscore the overall
impact of PCGF’s changes within the Allegheny
County jail system. -

Although their examination of the county
jail system is not yet complete, McCauley says
that the preliminary data seems to indicate
that there has been a reduction in recidivism,

and she feels that PCGF’s work with programs
‘ within the jails deﬁnitely played a role. ‘

“The bottom line is [PCGF has] been a fan-

I tastic ally to the Allegheny Countyjail Collab-

orative,” she said. “And.we are so, so fortunate
to have them here in Pittsburgh.” I I
But while these external studies are not yet
concluded, members of PCGF are nonetheless
proud of their contributions to the community.
“I’m really proud of the work that 'We did
with the community, the organizations we
partnered with and the families that our pro-
grams impacted,” said Golden, “and I’m con-
ﬁdent the changes our initiatives made will-
continue to have a positive impact.”

Oakland farmers market offers fresh produce, pastries in summer  

Mahita Gajanan
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

At 3 p.m., a crowd forms outside the Carn-
egie Library in Schenley Plaza as vendors
set out their goods at the Oakland Farm-
ers’ Market, where residents can ﬁnd veg-
etables, such as kohlrabi, vegan cookies and
hot cross buns.

Dino Lopreiato brings Italian baked
goods from Vibo’s Italian Bakery in Brack-
enridge, Pa. He works while he talks, paus-
ing only to sell to eager customers, who
enjoy the fresh-baked pies and elephant
ears stored on the table. Red—raspberry pie
is the popular choice of the day. Lopreiato
also sells pepperoni bread, punchi, which
are small Polish donuts, and long and round
breads.

‘ “Everything is made by hand,” Lopreiato
says, showing the differences between two
of the same pastry —— an indication of their
true individuality.

From 3 to 6 p.m. every Friday, about
ﬁve to seven vendors, including My Good-
ies Vegan Bakery, Dillner Family Farm and
Vibo’s Italian Bakery, set up shop in Schenley
Plaza to sell Oakland-area residents freshly
grown and homemade food.

The Oakland Farmers’ Market is a proj-
ect of the Oakland Business Improvement
District and has been active in the neigh-

borhoodfor years, although this is the ﬁrst ‘

Jwy17,2013lTheF%tNewelvwmmpmnawsconw

year that the market is in Schenley Plaza. H

According to Deanna Hitchcock, owner and
operator of My Goodies Vegan bakery, an in-
dependent bakery specializing in pure vegan
and allergy—friendly treats, the vendors see
about 200 customers on a fast day, typically
when the weather is good and students re-
turn to Oakland. The market runs from early
June until mid-‘October. V

Selling fresh food at farmers markets ’

allows a certain amount of independence.
Hitchcock rents a commercial space to

_ bake and travels to different farmers’ mar-

kets around the Pittsburgh area. She has

spent six years baking and selling through

the farmers’ market circuit. '
Hitchcock said that having a farmers’

’ market in theloakland areais good for stu-

dents who often don’t know where to buy
fresh orhomemade ingredients.
Customers can also ﬁnd a variety of fresh
fruits'and vegetables, depending on what
is in season at the time. Mary Windstein

SUBLET

the house and is also held responsible if the
subletter neglects to pay the rent or utilities.
While Springer’s landlord did not require

her and her subletter to sign a contract or '

leave a deposit, the two did so on their own.
Springer had a lawyer, who was also the father
of one of her friends, create a contract, and
she advised others looking to sublet his or
her properties to sign similar contracts and
require the subletter to leave a deposit.
“Nearly everyone is willing to do so, and it
helps avoid problems if the subletter pays you
late or damages the apartment,” Springer said.
In the state of Pennsylvania, a landlord
has the right not to allow a tenant to sublease,
and Joel Owens, a representative of Oak Hill
Apartments, said subletting is against the
company’s policy and always has been, but
did not elaborate on the company’s reasoning.
Bruce Berman, a private landlord who of-
fers student housing in Highland Park, said
that he “generally frown[s] on subletting be-
cause you lose control of responsibilities.”
Berman is wary of subletting, especially
after seeing his relatives have problems with
it, but still allows his tenants to sublet after
goingthrough all of the procedures the original
lessee completed.
But not every subletter will have to interact
with the landlord. ,
Sieman said a realty company handled the
subleasing process for him and Puhac, while
Sadoski said they haven’t had to interact with

anyone but the original tenants.

The original tenant of the apartment from
which Sadoski is subletting is a former high
school classmate, which she said made the
experience more manageable. .

“It’s less awkward for sure, and it’s nice to
just be able to text the [lessee] with any ques-
tions that I have about the place,” she said in
an email. “I just feel comfortable, and it’s also
a trust thing too. It’s a person that you know
isn’t likely to lead you astray.”

With their subleases ending in August, Sa-
doski and Puhac have had the time to develop
their own advice on subletting.

Sadoski said to start early if you want a lot
of options but added that “the later you start,
the more negotiable people get with the price.»
I did ﬁnd a place that was $200 [a month],
but it was unfurnished, and that wasn’t what

' . I needed.”

Puhac is living with two roommates whom
she had never met before.VShe urged others
to focus on the people who might share your
temporary living space. _

“Make sure you are comfortable living
where you are subletting,” Puhac said in an
‘email. She added, “Don’t be afraid to live-with
people you don’t know. You may end up mak-
ing friendships that will last a lifetime.”

Like Puhac, Sadoski is also living with
roommates she had not met, but she used a
familiar analogy to describe subletting.

“It’s kind of like the ﬁrst year of college_—
tryingto not [impose] on other people’s spaces
and still trying to make sure you pay for toilet
paper,” she said. I ,

ably benefit from Yacoub’s plans to share
responsibility with ofﬁcers and members
of' the organization in preparing and or-
ganizing events. .

Yacoub also said that he wanted SJP to
distance itself from -its image as a radi-
cal or “protest” club by portraying itself
instead as a human rights group.

Yacoub said he wants to educate Pitt"
students about how Israeli policies, such
as frequent security checkpoints, affect
Palestinians’ daily lives. Along with check-
points, he listed Israeli-only roads for
Jewish settlers in the West Bank, separate
bus lines for Palestinians in Israeli ter-
ritory and-a security barrier Israel has
been erecting in the West _Bank as major
factors that cause ordinary Palestinians
to live in fear. if .

In order to relate to U.S. college stu-
dents,.he said the group will tailor its
message to compare the current state of
Israeli-Palestinian relations to the Jim
Crow laws that suppressed blacks in the
American South before the Civil Rights
Movement of the 1§6os.

Although Yacoub said he wanted to

change SJP in order to make the club’s

leadership more inclusive and less radical,

he emphasized that he’s not interested in '~

opening dialogue with pro-Israel groups
on campus, insisting that Israel is the op-
pressor and Palestine is the victim.

But Alex Bryant, who will take over as
acting president of Panthers for Israel in
the fall, said dialogue is the only means of
achieving progress in relations.

“Open dialogue isalways the best so-
lution, and Panthers for Israel has said
that over and over again,” Bryant said in
an email. - I '

Bryant has been in Israel since late May ;

and will stay there until early in August.
There, she’s interning with the Ethiopian
National Project, an educational and out-'
reach program aimed at youth in Ethiopi-
an-Israeli communities. I

Bryant also said that comparisons be-
tween Israeli policies and segregation laws
in the American South were unwarranted
because Palestinians are not Israeli citi-
zens. The Palestinian Authority governs
the West Bank, while Hamas governs the
Gaza Strip. I

The Israeli government does maintain
two bus lines for Palestinians who live in
areas in the jurisdiction of the Palestinian
Authority but work in Israel, though this
is not a segregationist policy, Bryant said.
Palestinians, along withlanyone else who

. enters Israeli territory, are legally entitled

to use the country’s public transit.
“This is nothing like pre—Civil Rights

America, where buses were separated and" ,

segregated; there are no“Muslim’ and ‘Jew-
ish’ sections,” Bryant said in an email.

Facilitating Activism

Last November, Israel conducted air
strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, militants linked to Hamas
retaliated by ﬁring rockets into Israeli
territory. Yacoub said that during this pe-
riod, SJP organized a protest against Israeli
operations.

Although more than 100 attended the
demonstration, which was held in Oakland,
few or none of the attendees went on to
become involved in SJP, which only has
about 25 active members. Yacoub said he
wanted to build an organization that could
retain outsiders.

“When Palestine was on the mind of
everyone, we could have capitalized on it,”
he said. “But instead, [the opportunity]
was just wasted.” '

Few or none of those who had shown
up for the demonstration remained active
in the club.

SJP is not, however, the only advocacy
group in modern times that has suffered
from a phenomenon Yacoub labeled as
“slacktivism.”

. Jackie Smith, a professor of sociology
at Pitt whoco—authored an article detail-
ing the “tyranny of structurelessness”
that plagued Occupy Pittsburgh, said she
has heard the term “clicktivism” used to
describe ﬂeeting, web—based interest in
social movements. She said that, in gen-
eral, activism is ineffective without strong
organization. « .

“This is not something that’s unique
with the [pro—]Palestinian movement,”
she said. “This is a huge problem with
social movements.” '

In order to retain members, she said,
activist groups need to combine web-
based and informational campaigns with
face—to-face interaction.

Yacoub said that he‘wanted to find
ways to combine educating the public with

cultural events through which members ’

could enjoy themselves and draw more
attendees from outside SJP.

“We’re' college kids,” he said. “We’re
privileged kids. We have lives. I would
like to mesh our lives with these issues.”

()rgan1ze' (1 activities are needed to end
,“summer slide” for youn er students

Simon Brown
For The Pitt News '

If you were to ask any 12-year-old
whether or not he’s excited for
the onset of summer, his response
wouldn’t be difficult to predict —
that is, if he has the attention span
to even provide one. -

Ask anyone whose school days
are well behind him to recount
some of his’ most cherished ado‘-
lescent memories, and chances

are that _a disproportionate‘

amount occurred during the sum-
mer seasons. '1
There’s a special relationship
between our recognized rites of
passage and those three months
of freedom, mirth and no home-
work. The cultural signiﬁcance of
summer to a child’s hormone—rid-
. dled journey from adolescence to
adulthood is reinforced in popular

* ﬁlms such as “Grease” and “The

Sandlot.” This should come as
no surprise to most: The quarter
of the year out of school enables
students to spend time with fam-

‘ ilyand enjoy social experiences,
which are education in their own
right.

But, without any of these bene-
ﬁts of a liberated summer, it would
be needless and ineffective to re-
lease students injune, only to re-
turn in September with signiﬁcant
‘.‘summer learning loss.” And this
summer slide is far more danger-
ous than the slides that kids usu-
ally associate with summer vaca-

‘ tion..Study after study concludes

that such a long break results in
an average loss of one month’s
worth of content in mathematics
and up to three months in reading
comprehension.

What is perhaps most strik-
ing in this data, however, is the
signiﬁcant discrepancy in reten-
tion when considering students’
family incomes. ‘ ,

‘According to one study com-
pleted by the Johns Hopkins
School of Education that tracked
the math and reading abilities of
low- and high-income students,
both groups advance compara-
bly in reading and math during
the year, however, the former de-
clined in ability’ during the sum-
mer while the latter marginally
improved.

: It’s evident from this data that

those who could most beneﬁt.

from the enrichment that happy
memories of vacations and sum-
mer camps provide might not ac-
tually receive these opportunities.
Even this bastion of innocent fun
represents one more space in the
achievement gap between poor
and privileged students.

This, however, should come
as no surprise when one consid-
ers the few educational beneﬁts
mustered in defense of summer
vacation. Sure, students with edu-
cated and ﬁnancially secure par-
ents can reap the developmental
beneﬁts of vacations, camps and
independent learning, which pre-
vent memory loss, but these luxu-
ries aren’t readily available for
those students who already face
obstacles at home and in school.

While several parents welcome
—. initially, at least — the oppor-
tunity for quality time with their
children, those unable to take any
considerable time off from their
jobs are left to scramble to place
their children in free summer pro-

Ultimately, the season long concession
that schools make to students, parents and
teachers has the potential to produce a host
ofeducational beneﬁts that students of any
age could energetically recite. Disposing of

 

this recess would be culturally naive. But,
once educators dismiss students from the
ideally equalizing public school sphere in
the summertime, they must realize that this
break allows the socioeconomic inequities
to creep back into students’ development.
Policy makers at the state level, then, ought
to provide universally accessible summer
programs for students disadvantaged by
the vacation. And for those critical of any
expansion in state spending, these pro-
grams should represent a more efﬁcient
reallocation of funds than an additional
expenditure. Consider the money saved
by efficiently utilizing the autumn months,
which now go wasted, dedicated to needless
review of material from the previous school
year. This beneﬁt, not to mention the dent
placed in the achievement gap, could surely
counterbalance any cost.

School administrators and charitable
foundations are already beginning to catch
on, as both increasingly widen funding
streams to rigorous academic summer
camps in districts across the nation, in—
cluding Pittsburgh Public Schools’ Summer
Dreamers Academy program. Though these
certainly offer encouragement, it leaves
state governments — the constitutionally
appointed guardians of education —-— to
standardize funding across all districts,
urban and rural.

And if parents can muster the courage to
send their children back to school during
those hot summer months, then politicians
have no excuse. in

Beer ﬁmdamentals: making sense of the summerb‘eer conundrum

Jackson Crowder
For. The Pill News

As temperatures begin to approach the upper
90s — with humidity to match — and Game
of Thrones disappears, what is there to do all
summer besides lament the end of hockey sea-
son‘? According to the ﬂurry of advertisements
that pop up during the summer months, the
answer is drink beer. Beer companies seem to
spoil the consumer during the hotter months of
the year, as each one claims to have the perfect
beer for summer.

But what makes a summer beer, really? The
obvious answer, asjustin Viale, assistant brew-
master of Pittsburgh’s Church Brew Works, puts
it, is a beer that is “refreshing and drinkable to
the point where you can have a few. Along that
same line, probably lighter in alcohol, which
is going to help it be lighter in body overall.”

Lightness, however, especiallyas it applies to
beer, is a very broad category. Styles including
various ales, kolsches, pilsners, certain hefe—
weizens and even the woeﬁxl American adjunct

. lagers such as Bud Light fit the bill perfectly.

According to Viale, the barrage of beer ads
this time of year connects to a basic truth of

the season: Americans drink more beer in the P

‘ summer.

“There’s deﬁnitely  a seasonal component
to, I guess I’ll say quantity of beer drinking.
You get into the swing of summer, and people
are doing more cookouts and more sporting
events and things like that where they might

. go through more beer,” Viale said. “I think it’s a

result of what the beer is that makes it sellable.”

The ability of any brewery, no matter its
size, to actually sell the beer that it makes is
paramount. Thus, given the popularity of an-

_ nually released seasonal beers, it’s little wonder

why brewers try to get a jump on their market
competition. And if that means releasing a beer
before its appropriate season, so be it.

“It’s easy to sell an Oktoberfest a little early,”
Viale said. “It’s impossible to sell an Oktoberfest
when it’s November. Once it hits November,
people are looking for Christmas beers.”

Scott Smith, owner of East End Brewing ‘

Co., agrees.

“There is certainly a lot of seasonal creep,”
Smith said. “I think this month you might see
pumpkin beers on the store shelves in the
month ofjuly, which to me is insane  Every-
body wants to be ﬁrst in the pool, and it just

Brett Sholtis
For The Pitt News

During one weekend everyyear, Schenley Park
becomes a racetrack. '
On Saturday, July 20, and Sunday, July 21,

' the citypark popular for jogging, nature walks

and golﬁng will transform into the location
of the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, an auto
race that brings together drivers and racing
fans from all over the country while compil-
ing a collection of classic cars that date from
pre—World War 11 through the 1970s.

' The Grand Prix began 31 years ago, when A

racing enthusiasts Art McGovern and Mary
Beth Gmitter paired up with Myron Cope, the
legendary Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster
and Pitt graduate, to create a race that would
raise money for two local charities, the Autism
Society of Pittsburgh and the Allegheny Val-
ley School.

“It’s the charity aspect that makes the event
unique,” said Steven Weber, the PVGP on—site
media director. Weber, an active director for
24 years, indicated that, to date —r discluding
2013 — the Grand Prix has raised $3.2 million
for the two charities.

In addition to its distinction as a charity
race, the PVGP is among the increasingly small

. number of vintage car races that are held on

Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix provides a glimpse into the past

city streets rather than on racetracks. Accord-
ing to Michael Zappa, an avid vintage car racer
and member of the PVGP board of directors,
the Schenley Park races are now the longest
consecutive—running vintage street event.
Zappa, a Pitt graduate, has raced in the
PVGP for at least 20 years and traced his love
of the event back to his days as a student, when
he drove around the park at speeds he would
rather not admit. With Schenley Park boast-

ing 21 turns three of which are 180 degrees, .

Zappa was ecstatic when he learned he would
actually be allowed to drive fast there.

It’s not just a j oyride, though, noted Zappa.
All drivers must have racing licenses, ﬁre- and
crash—resistant gear, and their vehicles must
undergo an extensive safety inspection. In ad-
dition, all 228 cars are checked to ensure that
they comply with the PVGP rules,‘ which help
to keep the race authentic to its respective era.

“The idea is that you race the way it was
raced then, so there is no unfair driving with
modern technology,” said Zappa.

He pointed to brakes as one example of
the unique rules of a'vintage race. While brake
pads could be made of modern material, the
rotor.style and caliper must be authentic to
that vehicle. - ' E

Dehydration poses threat to doggies during hot summer days

Matt Singer
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

When a dog runs around Schenely Plaza on
a warm, sunny day in the summer, it imme-
diately becomes the center of attention. But
just like humans who engage in outside rec-
reation, that pooch can quickly become de-
hydrated. Pet owners must take precautions
to prevent their pets from dehydration in the
hot weather. Dogs are vulnerable to overheat-

ing, which can escalate the symptoms that _

accompany dehydration andpose serious
risks for dogs. Dehydration, if not reversed

with proper hydration, can result in major 1 _

health complications. '

“Water is essential to all living beings, . _ c
includingdogs, who depend on proper daily _ T
ﬂuid intake to maintain appropriate health,’ ’= --
Maurene Baum oftheWestern"Pennsylvania 

Kennel Association said in an email. “It makes
up to 80 percent of your dog’s body.” Ac-
cording to Baum, water is vital for canines’
natural processes, including circulation and
digestion. _ _

But how can one tell if Fido is dehydrated?
_Symptoms ‘of dehydration in dogs include
sunken eyes, -uncharacteristic lethargy, a loss

of appetite, excessive drooling, dry mouth and
depression, all of which are markedly similar-

to the symptoms observable in humans -
except maybe the drooling.

But dehydration isn’t the only risk that
the summer months pose for dogs. In a press

How to make the most of thissumni1er’s music festivals

Nick Voutsinos
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Summer is a unique time of year, for every-
thing about it is ﬂeeting. The relationships
you form, the undertakings you pursue and
even the body you work to maintain all tend
to be distinct aspects of the season.

This is why we millennials revel in sum-
mer: It’s the time of year when we dig our-
selves out of the daily rut of classes and
responsibilities and move toward an en-
vironment that rewards impulsivity with
new adventures and punishes caution with
boredom. So it’s essential to take advantage
of this short time by- allowing summer to
take you away from the norm and propel you
into these new and fulﬁlling experiences.

One example of a unique summer ex-
ploit is music festivals, which successfully
embody the summer attitude of removing
all inhibitions. Crowds of people, with faces
kissed by the sun and dirtied by sweat and
paint, share only one concern —- the music.

This carefree attitude explains the lack
of hygiene, but it also exempliﬁes precisely

why music festivals are such fantastic sum-
mer experiences. They provide a setting
in which concerns are ‘left outside of the
festival area and are replaced with music.
While festivals only lasta couple ‘of days,
they leave participants feeling physically
exhausted, yet ardently fulﬁlled. So even if
you’re a casual music fan, shelling out the
cash to attend one of these events will most
likely end up being a worthwhile summer
investment. ’

In order to make this venture fulﬁlling,
preparation and planning before the festival
is in order. You can’t simply wing some-
thing as epic as this. While grocery lists and
proper shoes become necessities, having
good friends with you is the most essential.
Naturally, having friends with you provides
a bit more comfort, therefore making your
awkward dancing seem less awkward — it’s
discernibly easier to let loose with accepting
friends by your side. .

But don’t be afraid to talk to strangers
when at the festival. Most festivalgoers are
as friendly as they are interesting — per-
haps because the good majority of them

0

are under the inﬂuence of something -

but never mind that. The crowd _is_ part of »

theexperience,;and you will most likely
ﬁnd yourself feeding on the energy of those
around you.,After allifyou don’t want to
simply stand there when everyone else is
jumping up and down —— that’s not proper
festival etiquette. ' . _
In order to have a good time, you should-
simply follow the crowd and disregard stan-
dard social conventions while there. Em-
brace the carefree attitude of your fellow
festivalgoers and acknowledge the limited
time you have to fully absorb the experience.
This holds true for the tailgating aspect
of the festival as well. That is, if your festiva
of choice has tailgating. A *

. If your festival does," it’s a plus because
tailgating depends on those around you.
While tailgating before the concerts, it’s
common for festivalgoers to- graciously
share grills, burgers and, of course, bever-

ages, for the sake of a good time. Thus, an _

atmosphere of absolute summer perfection
emerges, in which awesome people, great
food and ‘relaxation become the main at-

tractions.
‘By the time you reach the actual concert

and you’ve had your ﬁll of hot dogs and ‘

beer, you should be ready for some music.
Normally, there are all types of bands to
choose from, and there is no better way to
experience a new band than to do so live.

Hence, when you’re waiting for the bands ~

that you already knowingly love, take advarfib
tage of this opportunity to experience some
new music, which will most likely result in
the expansion of your iTunes library after
the festival. .

At ﬁrst, this melodious diversity might
cause sensory overload. Throughout th
day, electronic beats and heavy guitar riffs
bombard you, lightshows entertain you,
and the smells of barbeque and weed litter
the air. Consequently, there’s a lot to take
in.Try not to worry about experiencing ev-
erything. As cheesy as it sounds, it’s really
best to just be spontaneous. It’s important!‘
to remember during a concert that there’s
really no time like the present. Enjoy what

TPN FASHIONISTO

For great summer outﬁts, loo

Matt Singer
Stqﬁ’ Wrt2'er

'-Anyone who believes the old adage, “when
you look great, you feel great,” must not have
ever had to don a fashion-forward outﬁt

*’ ‘When it’s humid and 85 degrees outside .

The hot and sticky days of summer can
push thoughts of well-pressed shirts and
achieving perfect color combinations to
the back of your mind. But the hot weather
doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t be hot,
too.

First and foremost, everyone can capital-
ize on the increased sunshine that summer
brings by investing in some pastel-colored
garments. Once the spring season rolls
around, most fashion retailers make it a
point to showcase their pastels with signs

‘or intricate displays so they are easy to ﬁnd.
It’s good to stock up, as these stores almost
always have some sort of sale in the begin-
ning of the season, allowing color-minded
shoppers to get their ﬁx early on. '

Shoppers can ﬁnd many articles of cloth-
ing colored salmon, sun-kissed orange, gen-
tly faded electric blue or soft yellow. One of
the great things about pastels is that their
color scheme is incredibly versatile, which
means that newcomers to these summer

‘_ shades can rest easy knowing they don’t

1

, necessarily need to suit up in pastel from ,

head to toe.
Guys, for example, can pair pastel v-
‘necks or collared shirts with basic khaki

shorts; most undoubtedly own at least two
or three pairs already. This is a great look
for both the fratty and the faint of heart. A
simple shirt, paired with some shorts, preps
you for a casual picnic or other summer ac-
tivity, but a salmon button-up tucked into
clean, above-the-knee tan or khaki shorts
can easily outﬁt you for a Kentucky Derby-
esque mixer. A

Women, who at our age tend to be bolder
and more accepting of the day’s latest fash-
ion, can ‘lace up some solid—colored Keds,
Vans TOMS or any other form of loafer-like
or slip-on footwear when they sport their
soft-hued outﬁts. These shoes are less ornate
than say, a pair of gladiator sandals, which
immediately grab attention — something
to stray from particularly while wearing
pastels. _

Avoiding gaudy apparel is something
everyone should keep in mind during the
summer or at least during the daytime.
Summer fashion relies heavily on a sort of
bespoken modesty that results from heat.
You can’t layer or complement a great shirt
with a cardigan, and you can’t shoot for a
sleek look as easily as you can when winter
grants you more leeway with the addition
of pants. Summer’s heat demands compli-
ance, and therefore, mandates us to pursue
a minimalist sense of fashion.

Don’t get me wrong: Gladiator sandals
deﬁnitely have a proper time and place, but
you should tread lightly and avoid pitting

modes of calm against clashing bits of ex- -

citement. Pastels are the perfect example:
If,you’re going to take a muted hue out of
the closet, keep the rest of the day’s outﬁt
relatively docile as well.

Guys might be familiar with the phrase,
“sun’s out, guns out” — that summer rally-
ing cry to bust out your sleeveless shirts and
pihnies. However, some members of the prep
community have recently created abelow-
the—waist equivalent: “sky’s out, thighs out.”

Yes, shorter shorts are back in style.
These curtailed antitheses to their baggy, be-
low—the-knee counterparts, which emerged
in the late 1990s and early 2000s, aren’t as '
revealing as their 1970s forefathers, but you
might want to work on your thigh tan a bit.

Made popular through aggressive online
marketing by companies such as Chubbies,
who bill themselves as selling “radical shorts
for men” and assure buyers that “thigh liber-
ation never looked so good,” shorter shorts
have made a resurgence and are becoming a
staple in the summer wardrobe of preppier
guys. And the diffusion of the shorter shorts
trend has landed many pairs in the majority
of commercial stores, tagged with stickers
labeled “prep ﬁt” or “high leg.”

However, since these are the latest trend,
they tend to be expensive. But a little bit of ‘
DIY cufﬁng can transform an already exist-
ing short into something more fashionable.

Many standard shorts that fall very slightly -

below the knee can be cuffed until they rest

— an inch or half inch above the knee.

Be "aware of how these cuffs look, though. '

kg to pastels, prep ﬁt shorts

If you cuff the legs of your pants in the spring
or fall, you’ll have some sense of too high or
too low. But, if you’re unfamiliar with the
cufling ways, there are a few things you need
to take into consideration. For example,
remember that your shorts shift on your legs
when you sit down, so too much cufﬁng will
have your shorts riding up relatively high
when you sit. Also, if your shorts aren’t a
slim ﬁt on the leg, cufﬁng them make result
in a_very boxy appearance that leaves too
loose of a ﬁt. .

Girls are able to get a bit funky with their
shorts by injecting ﬂoral patterns and the oc-
casional acid wash into their wardrobez, two

styles guys can’t necessarily pull off. These -

come in addition to the standard range of
options presented by solid—colored shorts,
which are easy to match, but run the risk
of redundancy. ‘
As long as you don’t go overboard with
patterns. to the point of buying something
that looks as if it’s fromjustice or some other
tween store, shorts with a little extra zest can

_add a noticeable pop to your outﬁt.

— Just remember the basic rule of patterns:
never mix them. This is especially true in
summertime because of the aforementioned
minimalist approach. But no matter what
gender you are or what style you stick to-, as
long as you don’t try too hard, you’ll be ﬁne.

. If you’re doing summer fashion correctly,
it should almost seem like you’re doing noth-

ing at all — but still looking damned good

while doing it. i

Jeff Ihaza
Staff If/rzrter

. Early on in Harmony Korine’s much-hyped and
frankly game—changing ﬁlm, “Spring Break-
ers,” the line between reality and fantasy be-
comes blurred in a way that’s only possible in
today’s landscape. -

“Pretend you’re in a video game or some-

- thing,” one of the ﬁlm’s ex-Disney heroines

’9'declares.

Like in-game footage of Grand Theft Auto V,
the scene blooms into absolute anarchy as the
band of party-driven spring breakers mimic
every rap song cliche in existence and violently
rob a chicken restaurant. '

' Korine’s commentary stings in regard to
this generation of “parenting by way of televi-
sion,” and it’s haunting. .

His points make sense when the music
world’s recent chart—toppers are considered.
Somewhere in between the happy-go-lucky
days of Vampire Weekend’s “Oxford Comma”

“band Kanye’s manic-depressive anthem, “Hold
My Liquor,” outright happiness became a wild- .

ly foreign concept.
.Pop culture evolves in this way, too. Gen-
erations mold themselves around their pop

stars and for the ﬁrst time, the faults of alleged
pop culture gods — Yeezus; anyone? —— are
out in the open. This culture of blurred lines

between public and private lives creates avoid '

for celebrities such as Amanda Bynes, whose
Twitter hijinks exemplify the concept of an
off-the-rails teen star as she decides openly
whether or not she wants to have sex with
Drake. These outward displays offer a new
framework in understanding the deﬁnition
of celebrity.

And this new deﬁnition makes it a lot more
difﬁcult to separate reality from fantasy, and a
lot more problematic to simply fake it.

The indie music and hip—hop worlds have
long been obsessed with the idea of authentic-

ity, and the only difference now is that largely _

‘marketable music has caught on.

The Internet, or the new epicenter of just
about any social argument, is an obvious culprit
forthis emphasis on authenticity. A less—obvi—
ous cause of the shift, though, is the importance
of mass-produced music. Gone are the days
when a chart—f’opper simply needed a catchy
hook and a pretty face to sing it. Music-nerdom
has crept into popular culture, bringing an en-
tirely new set of rules for commercial viability.

Britney Spears didn*t need to be real dur-

ing her catapult to success because she was a
product of corporate sponsors itching for the
under-18 demographic. Reality shows such
as “Making the Band” were predicated on the

idea that music could be manufactured with a ‘

speciﬁc formula.

However, the recent commercial success
of independent artists rooted in their relat-
able existences has created a new standard of
success that necessitates, at the very least, the
acknowledgement of a dark side. Consider for
a moment that Odd Future’s ringleader is also
the head of a creative agency with the goal of
targeting young people. The game has changed
and the powers that be are well-aware.

With that added weight — the expectation
of anything more than escapism-pop culture
by virtue of its often unstable arbiters has been
given entirely new context. ' ‘

Ta_ke Miley Cyrus’ raucously controversial
single, “We Can’t Stop.” Setting aside for a mo-
ment the racial implications of a white former
Disney star reappropriating black culture for
the sake of rufﬂing feathers, the song is abso-
lutely haunting. 0 1 - _ ‘

For 3 1/2 minutes, Hannah Montana gives
the antithesis of a D.A.R.E presentation, trivial-
izing excessive druguse in away that falls short

of clever and lands on morbid. She’s trying, and
that’s what’s so sad about it. _
In a vain attempt at an uplifting youth an-

_ them, the song’s refrain mimics pop verses

of the past. ,

“It’s our party, we ‘can do what we want/
It’s our party, we can say what we want / It’s
our party, we can love who we want / We can
kiss who we want / We can see who we want,”
Ostensible partygoers whisper on the song’s
bridge. .

What’s different here, and what seems to
have the entire world in a ﬁt, is Cyrus’ attempt

at capturing reality. “And everyone in line in '

the bathroom / Trying to get aline in the bath-
room,” the former Disney star croons.

Miley’s nod at drug culture — or her more
problematic nod at what she wrongfully has
gathered as black culture — is a calculated
response to a desire for reality.

The problems arise when that reality is
manufactured, as it so often is. Korine’s “Spring
Breakers” lives in an MTV universe where

- the sight of cocaine in the bathroom is to be

expected and “getting turned up” as Cyrus
so eloquently puts it, is the norm. And if the
prevalence of darkly poppy songs such asthis
proves anything, it’s that we really can’t stop.

Exhibit showcases Pittsburgh’s fascinating role in Civil War

Vincent Smith
Staff Wrz'ter

Imagine living in Pittsburgh during the out-
break of the Civil War: Confederate troops
are moving north, their destination unknown
and — considering you might not have been a
radical Republican —- you’re not exactly sure
where you stand on the issues. Defending the
Union is imperative, but is it worth dying for?
Does President Lincoln plan to extirpate the
practice of chattel bondage of human beings,
or are there plans to concede to the South’s
demands? And possibly the most important
question of all: Does Gen. Robert E. Lee plan
to attack Pittsburgh, the Union’s Engine of
Production? From the organizer’s perspec-
tive, the Heinz History Center attempts to
shed new light on the way Americans View
the Civil War with its exhibit, “Pennsylvania’s
Civil War.” In honor of the 15 0”‘ anniversary
of the Battle of Gettysburg and in associa-
tion with the statewide Pennsylvania Civil
War 150 program, the exhibit, which runs
throughjan. 4, allows patrons to understand
how ubiquitous the effects of "the Civil War
were, speciﬁcally from Pennsylvanians’ point
of view.

“One of the things that sets the exhibit
apart is the way that we have told the story,”
Leslie Przybylek, curator of history at the

  
  
 

 

Heinz History Center, said.
The goal of the exhibit is to look “at [the
Civil.War] not so much in a purely chrono-

_ logical sense, but thematically looking at it

as an experience.” '

Starting at the home front and then mov-
ing on to the life of a soldier in a Union camp,
“Pennsylvania’s Civil War” shows how every
life in a Pennsylvanian household was af-
fected. ,

“If you were a young man here in the state
or a woman whose husband was going off
to war,” said Przybylek, “what are some of
the things you would have seen and felt and
heard?” -

The displays, artifacts and mementos
serve to answer these questions. Posters
reading, “Wanted:.A Few Good Men” and
“Save the Union” adorn the walls, echoing
Linco1n’s call for 16 infantries from the state
of Pennsylvania, second only to the state of
New York. The interactive “Which Hat Would
You Have Worn?” section describes the roles
and possible dispositions of children, women
and businessmen who remained at home.

These depictions describe Pennsylvanians
as unique pieces of the Northern puzzle, just
as the state itself had a speciﬁc place within
the war effort.

Described as the “Arsenal of the Union,”
Pennsylvania manufactured more than 3,000

‘canons, some weighing as much as 90 tons.

the can’t-miss attractions, considering it was

been cast nowhere else on earth at the time.”

BEER

* _ gkeeps creeping up every year.”

\

 

From the estimation of these two beer vet-
erans, the industry is losing its sense of timing,
and there is ample evidence to support this
argument. For example, Samuel Adams’ Al-
pine Spring — a beer intended for, you know,
s ring —— regularly hits stores and restaurants

late January, with Summer Ale arriving in
early April. .

In one sense, brewers are simply moving
ahead in an effort to maximize proﬁt. Smith
and Viale, however, maintain that this trend
will move seasonal releases up each year, forc-
ing them further and further away from their
intended season. A year-round beer drinker
who keeps up to date with availability will be
able to conﬁrm these suspicions, even ifby only
paying cursory attention. The moment a beer
consumer enters his favorite beer distributor
wearing shorts and ﬂip-ﬂops and sees a24-pack

Eovered in brown and orange leaves, he should
know something is amiss.

When asked ifhe thoughtthis was indeed the
case, Bill Powell of South Side’s Black and Gold
Beer Distributor replied, “Deﬁnitely! It does
seem like every year the seasonals come out
earlier and earlier,” citing the beer industry’s fa-
vorite —— and highly lucrative — whipping boy.

“We’ll probably have pumpkin beers in Au- ‘

gust,” Powell added.
If the idea of seasons is becoming less and
less relevant in the minds ofbrewers across the

- nation, aren’t consumers left simply with dif-

I1

      

ferent ﬂavored beers at different times of year?

Smith, for one, doesn’t ﬁnd this trend par-
ticularly troubling.

“It’s not like you’re standing outside in the
cold drinking [a winter] beer. You’re going to
be in a warm place that’s probably not that
different than it is in the summer months,” he
said. “What does this seasonal beerthing really
mean? Is it all just in our heads or just in our
marketing heads, you know, as we’re marketed
to as beer drinkers?”

In asking such questions amidst the sweaty
and cluttered environment of the East End
Brewing Co. office, Smith hits the proverbial
nail on the head. What makes ‘a pale ale or a
hefeweizen more of a “summer beer” ‘than a
stout or a porter?

In America, we insist on drinking all of our
beer at ice-cold temperatures anyway. Would
a chilled Brooklyn Summer Ale be any more
refreshing or thirst-quenching than a Rogue
Mocha Porter at the same temperature? Prob-
ably not.

Viale sums it up by saying, “What people
expect is what they’re going to wan .”

Thanks in large part to clever marketing, ,

the American beer drinker, myself included,
has come to expect summer beers with a light
body and minimal malty sweetness.

Whether or not it’s right, stouts and porters

aren’t associated with those qualities. Indeed, .

many dark beers do possess a light body and a
pleasant roasted ﬂavor that’s not too dissimilar
from iced coffee — another summer staple.
Guinness Ltd. tried capitalize on this idea
with the release of its Black Lager, a European

dark lager with a thin, refreshing mouth feel
alongside the smoky, burnt notes that dark
beer apologists crave. It’s yet another perfect
beer for summer, yet, despite Guinness’ efforts

. to market this beer as a refreshing summer

component — as evidenced by its commercials,
which frequently appear on ESPN — consumer
still seek out this dark lager more heavily in the.
colder months and, of course, on St. Patrick’s
Day. ‘ .
Beer drinkers choose to follow the trends,
which truly demonstrates the immense power
ofboth advertising and preconception. So if the
seasons are as irrelevant to seasonal beers as

they seem to be, why continue with the con-

struction of seasonal beers?

‘As Smith puts it, “Seasonal beer is one of
the few things that we can truly embrace as a
change throughout the year.”

T In spite of everything, he’s right. p
Sure, a seasonal beer might come out a bit
early — sometimes to the point of absurdity
— but it still marks the passage of time. In that
regard, ‘seasonals accomplish their end per-
-fectly, even if their clocks ‘are always wrong.
How boring, one wonders, would life be with
only a few types of beer available? Seasonal
releases give beer drinkers something to look
forward to. . .
They give us a means by which we can trace
the history of our favorite breweries, while al-
lowing the brewers to stay creative. Whether
it’s enjoying a barbeque or sitting in front of
a crackling ﬁre, there is no activity that beer,
regardless of its seasonal association, doesn’t
improve. I E ‘

l§Rr°2M/iii PRIX

There are eight groups of cars in the race,
and the grouping is based on the decade in
which the car was manufactured. Group 8, the
Mambo Combo race, which includes cars from
different decades, is the largest classiﬁcation,
with 52 drivers participating.

Twenty-year racing veteran Dotti Bechtol
agreed with Zappa, mentioningthat one of her
cars, a 1959 Elva, had drum brakes, no power
steering and_a primitive suspension — chal-
lenges exacerbated by the quirks of Schenley
Park. , ’ _

Bechtol found her way to Schenley after
inheriting her father’s love of American cars
and forming her own interest in exotic sports
cars. These days she races a 1972 Porsche 914.6,
a 30o—horsepower racecar that’s not street-
legal. While she acknowledged that she was
in the minority as one of three or four female
racers among 50 or so men, she said that she’d
never had any issues navigating through a male-

dominated sport and had never been treated

differently because of her sex. ‘ .
“There’s no discrimination,” she said.

“Gentlemen do not let me go fast just because

Pmeawoman.” ‘

_ Above all else, the Vintage Grand Prix’s dis-
tinct use of space creates a race that’s entirely
unique and highly demanding.

“It’s so different from other race tracks,”
Bechtol said. “The road is crowned. There are

curves and stone walls. You have to keep your ,

wits about you.’f ’ I -

D ® (3 3 things outside a pet’owner’s control in the
summer heat because some dogs are more

with water and proper hydration. But for un-
trained or unfamiliar pet owners, it can be

difﬁcult to tell whether a dog is dehydrated ‘

or just out of breath.

Goldberg recommends two tests for de-
hydration.

For the ﬁrst test, Goldberg instructs pet
owners to pinch the skin on their dog’s back
into a fold and observe whether or not it stays
in place or returns to its normal position. If
the skin remains upward in a ridge, then the
dog might be dehydrated. ‘

The second test, he says, calls for the pet
owner to stick his or herlﬁnger into the dog’s
mouth and press on its gum line —— which
should be wet and slick, not dry and sticky
— until it becomes white. If the gum remains
white without returning to its normal pink
coloring within three seconds of the pet owner
removing his or her ﬁnger, then there is a

' A chance that the animal is dehydrated.

Goldberg warns against harmﬁil behaviors
such as leaving a dog in the car without the
air conditioning running or leaving the dog
outside without sufﬁcient water, even if the
dog is in a shadyarea.

Baum recommends providing clean water
that is changed regularly to ensure freshness.
Pet owners should wash the bowl containing
the water on a daily basis to prevent the spread
of waterborne bacteria that might exacerbate
illness if dehydration does set in. T

According to Baum, a dog should drink
at least one ounce of water for each pound
of its bodyweight per day. So, for example, if
someone owns ajack Russell terrier, which
typically weighs about 15 pounds, that little

guy should drink at least 15 ounces of water

each day.
Although prevention is key, there are some

susceptible to dehydration and overheating
because of their breed or underlying health
conditions.

“It is important to note that pets with ﬂat
faces, like Pugs, English bulldogs and Persian
cats, are more susceptible to heat stroke since

they cannot pant as effectively as animals ’

with a longer snout,” the Western Pennsylva-
nia Humane Society said. “These pets, along
with older pets, overweight pets and those
with heart or lung diseases, should be kept in
air-conditioned rooms as much as possible.”

To add to that list, Baum says that dogs
suffering from kidney disorders, cancer and
infectious diseases, along with pregnant or
nursing dogs and diabetic dogs whose con-
ditions aren’t properly cared for, also face
higher risk of dehydration.

In the event of dehydration, a pet owner
should immediately take action. If the condi-
tion is serious, veterinary assistance should be
sought immediately. Pet owners should give
their dogs fresh water as soon as possible, and
Goldberg recommends wrapping the animal
in a wet blanket or towel to help its gradually
cool off. But owners shouldn’t'douse or bathe
the dog in cold water, as this might send its
body into shock. ,

“A veterinarian will administer intrave-
nous or subcutaneous ﬂuids,” said Baum, who
also’ said the veterinarian might run tests if
he or she feels it is necessary to look for any
underlying causes of the condition aside from
the heat. _

When caring for a dog in these hot sum—
mer months, not only is prevention key, but
preparation is equally as important. There’s
a tie for the best way to treat dehydration:
Ensure it doesn’t happen in the ﬁrst place
and also have the ability to.identify it and
recognize when to. seek help. 1

,troops had decided to attack Pittsburgh, or
even Philadelphia?

“Pittsburgh could have been Gettysburg,”
Brady Smith, communications manager at
the History Center, said. “And at that time
that fear was very real.”

From a strategic standpoint, the idea was

"not only plausible, but also highly likely. A _

defeat of Union troops at their industrial epi-
center would have been a crushing blow for
the North. In preparation for such an attack,
both of Pennsylvania’s major cities, through
their respective Departments to Assist De-
fense, assembled a considerable workforce

July 17, 2013 I The Pitt News l wwvvpitmex/vs,00m

to build fortiﬁcations — a precaution that
we now know was for naught.

Perhaps the most gruesome part of the
display is the exhibit that takes guests into
the personal stories and bloody depictions
of a war whose horrors are at times diﬂicult
to describe.

Of the more than 33,000 Pennsylvanians

who died in the war, 60 percent of them died ‘

from noncombat—related injuries, with many
more having limbs amputated with no steril-
ization whatsoever. Because of these deplor-
able conditions, more than 7,000 volunteer
sanitary commissions were instituted nation-
wide to try and remedy the many preventable
deaths that occurred. It was just another ex-
ample of how almost every American citizen

was involved in the Civil War in one way or

another.And often times, that involvement

transcended generations.

“I have always been interested in the Civil
War because my great-great—grandfather was
in the Civil War twice,” Denny Shealer, 66, a

. retiree from Philipsburg, Pa., said.

Shealer decided to make the trip to Pitts-
burgh for the new exhibit to reﬂect on the his-
torical and personal signiﬁcance of the war.

“At that time, people who did not want to
enter the draft could pay someone else to take
their place, so [my great—great—grandfather]
was in a second time,” he said.

From the battleﬁeld to the war’s after-
math, “Pennsylvania’s Civil War” concludes
with pictures of veterans’ parades, evidence

of long—lasting bonds between infantry mates
and political and metaphysical thoughts on
the outcome of such a bloody, national tumult.

By the end of the exhibit, Przybylek’s
words hold true: “The uniqueness of [‘Penn—
sylvania’s Civil War’] is that we really tried
to look for ways throughout the exhibit to
personalize it.”

The artifacts amassed by the Heinz His-
tory Center are not just historical relics, but
rather, personal heirlooms. And in the vein
of true historical analysis, the stories are
told as depictions of people representing a
greater whole. ,

A camp ﬁddle, belonging to the 193“
Pennsylvania Infantry, is on display with
the names of each member etched into the
aging wood. Music was a popular form of
entertainment during long periods of down-
time in the war.

Jacob Shénkel, a musician ﬁghting for the
Union, is shown in a photograph ostensibly
lying dead after a battle. At that time, cam-

eras were not quick enough to capture battle"

sequences, and it would take years before
historians realized that the photo was staged,
and Shenkel was just playing dead.

A life-sized ﬁgure of a bull terrier belong— 2

ing to Company F of the 102"“ Pennsylva-
nia Volunteer Infantry sits stoically among
bright display lights. With soldiers hundreds
of miles from home and missing any sem-
blance of the life they had known before, a
playful pooch was a stress reliever as well as
a morale booster.

“Pennsylvania’s Civil War” is an amalga-
mation of high—resolution photographs, au-
thentic artifacts and displays and interactive
pieces that help elucidate another side of
Civil War history. .

Smith said that the History Center has re-
ceived overwhelmingly positive feedback thus
far. She_aler mirrored the sentiment when he
described the exhibit as “very impressive,”
both in terms of content and appearance.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The ﬁrst few weeks of July have been busy
for the Pitt men’s basketballteam. July 1
saw the official entrance of the team to the
Atlantic Coast Conference. The next day, July
2, Pitt received a commitment from 2013
four—star shooting guard Detrick Mostella.

One week later, sophomore point guard
James Robinsonbecame the ﬁrst Panther
to win two gold medals playingbasketball

' against international competition. With

Team USA’s 82-68 victory over Serbia in

the FIBA Under—19 World Championship

game on July 9, Robinson won his second
gold medal..

“It’s a real honor to be able to say that.
I think my time at Pitt has really prepared
me to accomplish that, just being with my
teammates feeding off them and their work
ethic,” Robinson said. “And then learning
from our coaching staff here and being able
to applythat to the international-game and
implement that in the game and the con-
cepts brought about by Billy Donovan and
the rest of the coaching staff.”

While Robinson ended up playing for
the team, he was left off the U19 roster
originally, even though he played for the
under-18 team that won a gold medal in
Brazil last summer. He was a close call that
year as well.

“We weren_’t sure we were going to keep
him. We cut the team from 25 to 14 and then
kept guysaround to 12. He was originally
on the outside looking in,” head coach Billy
Donovan said last year. “But once we started
practicing we saw that he’s a winner and a
great role guy.”

In 2013, Robinson was one ofthe last

players to be cut.

“Billy [Donovan] has made it clear,” as- _

sistant coach Shaka Smart said in an inter-
view with ESPN’s Andy Katz. “Everyone is
trying out this year. We will pick the guys
that comprise the best team.”

But when Robinson later found out that
he was chosen for the squad, the turnaround
between his return to Pitt and his departure
to join the U19 team was quick.

“Originally I was not part of the 12-man
roster, so I ﬂew back to campus and was
getting ready to start classes and already
worked out with the team here, but I got
a call that Jerami Grant got ill,” Robinson
said. “So that same day I ﬂew back home,
got my passport, and the following day I
ﬂew overseas.” '

Grant was unable to play because he
was diagnosed with mononucleosis, which
resulted in Robinson replacing a lifelong
friend and former teammate at DeMatha
Catholic High School.

SPORTS

Robinson brings gold—medal experience to Pitt

“I’ve knownjerami since ﬁrst grade, so
it’s kind of ironic that I had to replace him,”
Robinson said. “He was upbeat, he did ev-
erything with the team, he just didn’t play.”

As for those who did play, they were
guided by some of the nation’s top coach-
ing talent: Florida’s Billy Donovan, Virginia
Commonwealth’s Shaka Smart and Virginia’s
Tony Bennett. Donovan owns two NCAA

‘ championships, Smart guided VCU to a Final’

Four berth in 2011 and Bennett enters his
ﬁfth season at Virginia with a .589 winning
percentage. V

“All three are very intense coaches, they
run terriﬁc college programs. The job they
did with us to really teach us on the ﬂy, it
was a terriﬁc job by them,” Robinson said.
“I think they deserve all the credit. We obvi-
ously went out there and played hard, but
they prepared us each and every day.”

That preparation resulted in a perfect

_ 9-0 run at the event by Team USA, as the

Americans beat their opposition by an av-

erage of 39.6 points. One such blowout in-'

cluded a 68-point demolition of the Russian
representation.

“It was a great experience. All 16 teams
at the event had talent, they were well-
prepared to compete,” Robinson said.
“It’s deﬁnitely a different style over there,
it’s a lot more physical than people may
think, 24-second shot clock, so possessions
are faster, a lot of transition game, a lot of
screen—and-roll stuff, so it deﬁnitely had a
college feel to it.”

Playing a higher level of competition
is something Robinson and the rest of the
Panthers will become accustomed to with
the transition from the Big East to the ACC.

“We know we have our hands full going
into the ACC with those higher teams, and
UVA’s going to be up there. It’s going to be a
lot of fun moving to the ACC, and I think just
bringing a little bit of leadership and con-'
sistency to the game is going to be needed.”

What to  
  watch for in 
Pitt football's
ACC debut

Dave Uhrmacher
Sports Editor

_ Season—opening football camp is less than

one month away, and Pitt football will kicks,-;
offits inaugural Atlantic Coast Conference
campaign injust a month and a half.

The buzz surrounding the upcoming
season is certainly warranted, with the
its start pushing Pitt into the national
spotlight alongside a home slate that the

. Panthers’ marketing department is calling

“the best home schedule in the country.”

As the saying goes, “to be the best, you
have to beat the best,” and the Panthers
will have plenty of chances to beat the
best of the ACC in their inaugural season.

Here are a couple of storylines to watAcl'i=‘-“-

during training camp and in the days lead-
ing up to the Sept. 2 showdown at Heinz
Field against defending ACC champion
Florida State.

A quarterback “controversy”

Head coach Paul Chryst won’t call it a
controversy at the quarterback position,
but when you have two or more solid can-
didates to command arguably the most:
important position on the ﬁeld, the situa-
tion is bound to produce discussion.

Following‘ the standout performance
of redshirt freshman Chad Voytik during’
the spring game, every mistake made by
assumed starter Tom Savage this season
will be met with calls for the stout Voytik
to take over.

But, the savvy veteran must stay fo-
cused on the Panthers’ opponents instead}
of on who is looming in the rear-view
mirror.

A freshman phenom

We’ll have to wait until camp starts to
get a glimpse ofwhat Chryst has in mind
for former Clairton star athlete Tyler,

Boyd, but until then, his recent perfor-“~“

mances suggest excellence in all facets
of the game.

Boyd didn’t wait to impress at the Big
33 Football Classic, taking back the open-
ing kickoff for a touchdown and following
that up with four more touchdowns. K’

Boyd is a receiver whom defenses will
have to focus on opposite Devin Street, ~

\‘ The Panthers won a team record 42 games

players drafted by major-league clubs: catcher

Elvin Soto by the Arizona Diamondbacks ,

and starting pitchers Ethan Mildren, by the

Mildren was the ﬁrst Panther off the board
as the Twins chose him in the 12th round at
No. 350 overall. While Mildren doesn’t throw
extremely hard, Deron Johnson, the Min-
nesota Twins’ director of scouting, told the
official team website that Mildren “throws
straight” and should project as starter go-
ing forward.

“My ﬁiture goals are to have a healthy
career and work my way up through minor
leagues and get a chance to play at the MLB
level,” Mildren said.

Mildren currently pitches out of the bull-
pen for the Elizabethton Twins of the Appala-

in his four appearances, in which he pitched
one inning a piece. He has allowed four hits,
three walks and struck out two batters.

“I’m currently coming out of relief right
now because of the amount of innings which I
had from school,” Mildren said. “It’s deﬁnite-

More reasons than ever to believe in the Pittsburgh Pirates

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The past two years saw the Pittsburgh Pi-
rates enter the second halves of the 2011 and
2012 seasons in contention for not just the
franchise’s ﬁrst winning season since 1992,
but also a playoff spot. Everyone knows how
those seasons ended, with the 2011 team at
72-90 and its 2012 counterpart fallingfrom
16 games above .500 injuly to a 79-83 ﬁnish.

As of July 14, 2013, the Pirates’ record
sat at 56-37, 19 games over .500, leaving the -3
team ﬁrmly in control of a wild—card spot and
closely trailing the St. Louis Cardinals, who
lead the National League Central Division.

For context, the 2010 Pirates won 57
games all season.

At the All-Star break, as the Pirates send

’ ﬁve players to represent Pittsburgh baseball

to Citi Field, the primary concern still lies in
Pittsburgh, as nothing will be enough to as-
suage the concerns of Pirates fans until the
Pirates record their 82nd win.

' But there are signiﬁcant reasons to believe
that will happen this year.

First and foremost, the Pirates’ bullpen
has been the strength of the team and should
continue to be a strength. All season, the
bullpen has kept the team in games and has
had what manager Clint Hurdle describes as
a “settling effect” on hitters.

  

  

Saturday, November 2, 2013

Join us... Meet our facufty, staff arid students. Tour our facilities and
ieam about our programs and the career opportunities they offer.

“I think our hitters feel that, once our
bullpen gets in, there’s a settling effect. I think
there’s a conﬁdence factor,” Hurdle said.

As for its own performance, the bullpen
has compiled a 2.79 earned run average, al-
lowed opposing hitters to hit just .209 and
stranded 81.8 percent oﬁ runners — the
best mark in Major League Baseball since

ﬁrst two months of the season now receives
cheers louder than the boos that rained down
on David Wright at PNC Park last weekend -
yes, the same player who initially snubbed
Alvarez for the Home Run Derby.

Another one of the Pirates’ ﬁve All~Stars,
Alvarez delivered arguably the best mo nth of
his career injune, batting .309 with 10 home

the dead—ball era of the early 20th century.
It’s a bullpen that sent Mark Melancon
and N L saves leaderjason Grilli to the All-Star
Game. The tandem has helped Pittsburgh to a
42-2 record when leading after seven innings.
,“It’s been like that since Game 1,” center
ﬁelder Andrew McCutchen said. “It’s not like
anything’s changed or gotten better. They’ve
been consistent this whole year  just being
able to shut it down?

runs and compiling an insanely high on-base
plus slugging percentage of 1.060.

“You’re watching, at times, him lay off
more pitches that he had a tendency to chase
early. He’s just growing. He continues to grow
as a power hitter, and he expects a lot out 0
himsel ,” Hurdle said. '

As a result of those expectations, Alvarez
has seemingly developed into the clean—up
hitter Pirates fans envisioned him becoming
when the team selected him with the No.
2 overall pick in the 2008 MLB Draft. This

 

year, Alvarez enters the All-Star break with?
24 home runs and an OPS of .830.

While McCutchen is having another solid
season, hitting more than .300 in the third
spot in the Pirates’ lineup, and Starling Marte
has emerged as one of baseball’s best leadoff
men, the biggest difference is Alvarez. The”:
continued success of Alvarez will be vital to
the Pirates, not just in winning 82 games, but
in making the playoffs as well.

Focus

But there are 162 games in a major—league
season, and while the 56-37 record through
93 games has Pirates fans ﬂocking to PN C
Park, there’s still plenty of work to be done in
the ﬁnal 69 games of the year. Take last season
for example, which saw the Pirates suffer one
of the worst collapses in baseball history.

But the current crop of Pirates are aware
of it. Just ask anyone in the clubhouse. E“

“We’ve grown up together, we’ve learned
together, we’ve taken some lumps together,
we’ve enjoyed some success together,” Hur-
dle said. “We’re pleased, we’re not satisﬁed.
There’s not a man in there that’s satisﬁed.”

For the 37-year-old closer, Jason Grilli,
a ﬁrst—time All-Star after 13 seasons in the
major leagues, the goal is the same as it’s
been since spring training.

“Our goals are the same since training
camp,” Grilli said. “We’re just trying to win

a World Series.” R

“Ethan deserves everything coming his

career,” and I am conﬁdent he will have the
opportunity to pitch in the"big leagues.”

Elvin Soto, C

The sophomore catcher from the Bronx
was one of Pitt’s best recruits of the Joe Jor-
dano era. The Panthers’ backstop was not
only responsible for catching the best staff in
Pitt baseball history, but also for producing
at the plate, where he hit .320 with six home
runs and 43 RBI.

Soto’s success, both at the plate and be- A
hind it, catapulted him to the All-Big East ‘

ﬁrst team. Soto was drafted with the No. 480
overall pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks in
the draft’s 16th round.

tainly for the past two years,” Jordano said

in a press release at the time of the draft. “I

believe Elvin felt he deserved to be drafted .

out of high school and, when that did not

happen, I think he made it an absolute goal to '

be drafted after his sophomore year.”

So far at Hillsboro, Soto has hit .226 with .

one home run and five RBI in 17 games. While
his average is below-average up to this point,
the patience Soto showed so often at Pitt has
already started to translate to the professional
ranks as he owns an on-base percentage of
.349, in large part because of the 10 walks
he’s drawn. 1

“I think he’s ready,” Jordarto said. “He
knows that he has a lot of work to do, but when

"he is in an environment where it is baseball

and that will allow the Pitt quarterbacks
to use every weapon in their receiving
arsenal.

A That arsenal includes sophomore
tight end _].P. Holtz, freshman tight end
Scott Orndoff, redshirt junior tight end
Manasseh Garner, redshirt junior receiv-
er Kevin Weatherspoon, junior receiver
Ronald Jones and others.

Look for Boyd to have an immediate

Stability at the helm .
Panther fans, rejoice and be happy. For

. the first time since Dave Wannstedt’s de-

parture, the same head coach who began
coaching the year before will once again
patrol the sidelines. ~
And -from the sounds of it, he isn’t,
going anywhere anytime soon. __
_ The verdict is not yet in on Chryst and
his job performance after just one season
with former coaches recruiting almost all
of his players.‘ , I
But, all signs are pointing up. Chryst
has filled his roster with players who

_ love two things: Pitt and playing football.

His second year will be abetter mea-
suring stick for how well things are going.
A dominant defensive front A
For the Panthers it all starts with se-
nior defensive lineman Aaron Donald on
the defensive side of the ball for a group
that finished 23rd nationally in points
allowed last’ season. ’ .
Despite last year’s accomplishments,
Pitt’s'group of experienced defensive
backs in the secondary will be put to
the task of covering a faster and more
talented group of receivers in the ACC.
Seniorjason Hendricks, senior K’Waun

Williams and sophomore Lafayette Pitts ,

lead a group of returning starters that
totaled. 15 interceptions last season.
The wild card _
Theraverage fan might not think of the
battle for the position of kicker 4 which
the Panthers’ fans know will be important
come crunch time — but it’s an'interest-
ing storyline as the team heads into camp.

and other competitors.

Of course, none ofthis speculation
is meant toestablish a definitive ﬂoor
or ceiling for the team this year, and ex-

pectations are exactly that. Panther fans

might have come to expect mediocrity,
but according to Aaron Donald, the off-
season preparation going on right now
will lead to ‘a season that is anything but
mediocre.

“Right now, we focused on this upcom-
ing season, working on this team and
trying to get better,” said Donald. “We
[are] just a football team getting ready
for the upcoming season.” I

doubtedly be a storyline in the early goings of
the season as a result of the departure of Tra-
Von Woodall because of graduation. Woodall
led the team in scoring at 11.5 points per game
and also handed out 5.1 assists per game.

“I got lucky last year having Tray in the
backcourt with me, and he taught me just
everything, all the nuances of the college
game,” Robinson said. “It was so beneﬁcial
to have him in my corner last year, and with
him gone I have to try to have a career hope-
fully as good as he had.” .

the ball, Robinson will run Pitt’s offense this

season as point guard. The promotion will

likely see an improvement over his fresh-
man numbers of 6.1 points and 3.5 assists _
per game. ' P ‘

A fantastic early sign of Robinson’s ability
to keep Pitt’s offense moving, though, was
his assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.83:1, which
placed him ninth among all Division I basket-
ball players and represented the best mark of
any freshman. 

“I’ve been trying to work on my total pack-
age, my entire game,” Robinson said. “I think
this year’s going to be a collective effortacross
the board. We have_a lot of new guys coming
in that are very skilled, and it’s going to be a
