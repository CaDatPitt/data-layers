The Pitt News Staff

Whenjonas Kerner saw a long line
of people outside Rita’s India on
Wheels, he didn’t think about the
wait. All he thought about was the

’ food.

“I just went to the one with the
biggestline. It’s a kind of mob psy-
chology,” the Pitt freshman said.
“There was a long line, so I as-
sumed it wouldbe good.” -

Although Oakland is. rife with
restaurants, there’s something
about the food trucks that sets
them apart from other campus eat-
eries. Every day, scores of people
gather on Bigelow Boulevard to
grab a meal from one of the four
food trucks parked on the street.
The trucks, which offer a mix of
Indian and Thai food, provide
quick, authentic meals in the heart
of campus.

But the consumer appeal of the
trucks has not sparked a growing

trend in Pittsburgh — partly be-. »

cause of Pittsburgh’s strict and
complicated permit system. And
after mandatory location changes
caused some owners to suffer dras-
tic losses in business, ﬁnding a way

to obey laws while boosting sales

’ has become more difﬁcult.

The carts didn’t always line Big-
elow Boulevard. They ﬁrst parked
outside the Hillman Library near
Schenley Plaza. But a city order in
2005 caused the trucks to pack up
and head over by Soldiers & Sailors»
Memorial Hall.

Mary Fleming, the city’s assis-
tant chief of code enforcement,
said the trucks had to move be-
causeof conﬂicts with the food
kiosks at Schenley Plaza. Regula-
tions set by City Council forbid
food trucks from being withinisoo
feet of a non-vendor business that
sells similar menu items.

Fleming said the regulations
make it more fair for restaurants
since their rent is typically much
higher than the cost of a truck’s
permit, which is usually around
$1,000 per year. I

But the move deeply cut into
proﬁts for the truck owners.

Rita Amin, owner of Rita’s In-
dia on Wheels, said business has
decreased by 50 percent since the
move. ‘

“I don’t get a lot of business
compared to Hillman Library. Hill-
man Library is a hot spot. Here, it’s
a longer walk. We are not doing

Before Amin started the busi-

EDITORIAL -

Battle for best
sandwich divides state

One of the great things about Pitt’s stu-
dent body is that it’s anything but homo-
geneous and anything but close—minded.
Not only do we associate with persons of
an array of political parties and subcul-

tures —- we even make food preferences

part of our. identity.

Two years ago, an editorial in our Din-
ing Guide evaluated the strengths and
weaknessesof Antoon’s‘and Sorrento’s
pizza (the overall superior product re-
mained undecided). Now, we’ve decided
to address another culinary debate that’s
preoccupied our campus for decades:
cheesesteaks versus Primanti Bros. sand-

. wiches.

What this dispute‘ is often reduced to,
of course, is a battle between Philadel-

phia and Pittsburgh — or, more broadly, "

A

F

 spy

tinct product, unlike cheesesteaks, which

- can be procured at countless establish-

ments in the Philly area, not to mention
the rest of the United States. The Pitts-
burgh staple has‘ an acute, unmatched
taste andaesthétic. A

The merits of (Philadelphia) chees-
esteaks ’ . 4

A good cheeaesteak — one purchased
at, say, Pat’s King of Steaks or Geno’s

Steaks ~— boastsgsomething the maxi-

malist Primanti Bros. recipe can never

achieve: simplicity. There’s a basic for— P

mula involved, but a formula that works
so well you’d be a moron to tamper with
it. Conservatism and tradition make the

* sandwich.

This adherence to tradition usually
necessitates a highly specified, highly

   

 

What this dispute is oiten reduced
to, of course, is a battle between
Philadelphia andPiltsburgh — or,‘ i
more broadly, Eastern and Western

T   i Pennsylvania. 1 o   

Eastern and Western Pennsylvania. In-

deed, much like the participants in the

. ongoing Wawa versus Sheetz and “soda” -

versus “pop” arguments,‘ the champions
of each sandwich are split neatly along

longitudinal lines. . V ~

It’s important, however, not to let
regional allegiances obscure the actual
merits of the foods. As such, we’ve ab-
stained from any arguments regarding
the superiority of one locale over the
other and let the facts’ speak for them-
selves. « '

The merits of Primanti Brothers sand,— p

wiches ’ V

First and foremost, Primanti’s sand-
wiches facilitate creativity. Their basic
ingredients — meat, coleslaw, fries —

V are compatible with countless variations

(throw in an egg or two, replace the beef
with‘ fish). Cheesesteaks, by contrast,
are traditionally static (onions and pep-
pers are among the few recognized top-
pings). ‘ A

Primanti sandwiches are also a dis-

 

-reﬁned set of ingredients: the chipped

beef used -in many esteemed restaurants,

the high-quality bread —-even the noto-

rious Cheez Whiz. Sure,‘ Primanti. Bros.

has a time-‘tested formula as well, but it’s,

not nearly as well known, nor as vener-
ated, '  ’ - , "

Also, while cheesesteaks are avail-
able across the country, Philadelphians
would maintain that th‘ey”re‘simply not
the same outside city li_mits..And per-
haps’ they’re right: Primanti Bros. has
branches outside the region; Pat’s and
Geno’s do not. L T

We won’t delude ourselves into think-
ing this exercise will change peoples’
allegiances —— ‘our own editorial board
couldn’t come to a definitive conclusion
on which was the superior sandwich. We
do hope, however, that a neutral new-
comer — someone from out of state, say,
or even the middle of the state —— can use
this editorial as a basis for picking a side,
without, hopefully, refusingto acknowl-
edge the strengths of both sandwiches.

Oakland residents
hire off - duty city
officer to patrol
this weekend

Danny Zaidi
Staﬂ”Wri ter

~ Rowdiness, ‘vandalism and

loud noise drove some South
Oakland residents to arrange
for preemptive measures

. against the wild behavior that

comes with Pitt’s Homecom-
ing weekend. , .

“At the beginning of this ,

year, we noticed some fairly

large parties that concerned »

the residents,” said ‘Nathan
Hart, vice president of Oak-
land" Community Council,
which aims to improve Oak-
land’s quality of life.

The residents decided to call

' upon an off—duty city officer

to patrol South Oakland from
10 p.m. to 2 ‘a.m. this week-

end, which is Pitt’s Homecom-

ing weekend.
’ “Homecoming weekend
seemed to be the most logical
weekend,” ‘I-Iart said about why
residents chose this weekend
to hire an off-duty cop. » '
Residents have cited vandal-
ism, excessive noise and pub-
lic urination as reasons for
hiring the off—duty ofﬁcer.
A city representative said

-hiring an officer costs $45.15

per hour, which means resi-

dents will have to pay around V

$180. ,

.“We are’ hoping that things
stay calm and the ofﬁcer
doesn’t have to cite anybody,”
Hart said.

Hart said that the noise and
vandalism that come with par-
ties worry the residents.

“If there is a party that has
an excess of a couple hundred
people and the hosts are sell-

ing entry, that is our main

concern,” he said. ,
South” Oakland resident

Rose Palmieri acknowledged

disturbances in the neighbor-

hood.

“This year it hasn’t been too _

bad with~the students,” said
Palmieri, who lives on Daw-
son Street. “They get row-
dy whenever the games are
over. When we won the Super
Bowl, they took couches off
the neighborhood here and
burned them on the sidewalk,

. which is ridiculous, you know,

but other than that, not too
bad.” ,

. Pitt was not immediately
available for comment.

Pitt students
were sympathetic with the
concerns ofthe long-term res-
idents, and thought students

who host parties should start.

to reconsider their behavior.

“I think it is unfortunate,”,

junior Andrew Serby said.
“I don’t think it is excessive

, enough, personally. For peo-
ple that live here, it is get— '

ting out of hand, and people
should take this as a sign to
settle down a little bit.”

Seniorjayson Myers said the
excessive rowdiness is a good
reason for the residents to
hire an off—duty cop.

“It does definitely get a little
rowdy on weekends and prob-
ably does need to be taken
down a bit,” he said. “How—
ever. the students should take
a lot of that responsibility on
themselves.”

Hart said that the Council
may look into hiring an off-
duty officer next year, as well.
This weekend will serve as a
trial run to decide whether

hiring an officer effectively’

calms the rowdy students.
,“We really want a sustain-
-able solution that meets stu-
dents’ needs and the longer-
term residents’ needs so we
can live in harmony.” Hart
said. “I was in a fraternity in
CMU, so I understand.” I

o Yesterday’s article on Occupy Pittsburgh did not clearly state when the march starts. The march will start at 11 am., bu -

Other universities provide
club sports game space

Josh Won
For The Pitt News

As the club sports teams at Pitt
continue their push for access
to game space at the Petersen
Sports Complex, the Athletic
Department insists that it will
not open up access to varsity-
designated ﬁelds.

But club team leaders have
recognized other universities’
leniency in allowing club sports
teams to use the varsity ﬁelds as
an example of what they would
like Pitt to do for club teams.

Last month, the Pitt men’s soc— '

cer club president, Ray Ludwig,
approached SGB to help_appeal
for use of the Ambrose.Urbanic
Field.

But the Athletic Department
has made it clear that the game

space at the Petersen Sports

Complex, home to the Ambrose
Urbanic Field, varsity baseball’s

Charlie L. Cost Field and soft-

ball’s Vartabedian Field, is not
intended for club sports game
use.

Athletic Department spokes-
man E._]. Borghetti said that
during the development of the
Petersen, Sports Complex, the
University and Athletic Depart-
ment decided it would only be
used for varsity competitions.
They decided to open up the
Trees Field area year-round for
recreational sports.

Yet at neighboring school
Carnegie Mellon, cooperation
between sport clubs and admin-
istrators for varsity ﬁeld use is
commonplace.

Sara Gauntner, the assistant
director of athletics for instruc-
tion programs and recreation at
CMU, said that club sports are
constantly sending in requests
to use varsity ﬁelds. Gauntner
coordinates times for students
to use the athletic facilities and
organizes ﬁeld usage with a new
schedule every two weeks. This

is in addition to physical educa- .

tion classes and varsity teams
who use the university’s_athletic
areas. .3. V
Gauntner said that she,consid-
ers it a natural privilegiefor all
university students to bé"'able to

use the ﬁelds.
“Of course they use our facili-
ties, because there’s nowhere

else for them to go,” she said,’ '

dismissing the idea of renting
an independent ﬁeld for more
than $1,300 per day, the wa
Pitt club teams do. -
The Pitt men’s soccer club cur-
rently resorts to renting a facil-
ity for about $1,300 per day in

order to participate in tourna.- A
ments. It requests moneykfromi

SGB because the Cost Center
ﬁelds do not meet regulations
for its games.

Of course, CMU’s competitive
varsity teams get ﬁrst priority
for ﬁeld use, but Gauntner ra-
tions out time slots when the
ﬁelds are available for nonvar—
sity students to use facilities, as
well.‘

“We try to give them asmuch:

time as we can, and we’re pretty
flexible,” she said. j

Considering the thousands of
students ‘ participating in club
teams every year, Gauntner said
she gladly shoulders the extra
effort to ensure students maxi-
mize use of their university’s
facilities.

“We have a pretty good bal-
ancing act on it,”‘she said. “We
make it work.”

Penn State also provides fields
for club sports, although they
don’t necessarily share the same
facilities as varsity sports.

‘According to Tommy Otter-
bine, Penn State’s club sports
program coordinator at Uni-
versity Park, both varsity teams
and sports clubs fall under the
Intercollegiate Athletic Depart-
ment at Penn State and, as such,
are all provided with facilities-
for use.

“That’s not to say all of the
facilities are shared,” he said.
“There are some that only varsi-
ty use. On the other hand, there
are some that only clubs use.”

With 78 clubs to consider,
Otterbine admits that techni-
cally, some clubs have to seek
off—campus resources for facili-
ties the university lacks, as is
the case with the Roller Hockey
Club. ‘  '

“But I don’t think that any of
our clubs are denied any: privi-

leges,” he said. “For example,

our varsity ﬁeld hockey and

club hockey team play on the
same field.”
Otterbine also affirmed that

‘ﬁelds designated strictly for

club use are full size and tourna-
ment ready. The only restriction
is use of Beaver Stadium, which
clubs such as soccer and lacrosse
are not permitted to use. 3
_ Back on Pitt’s ﬁeld, Board
member Ryan Gayman said that
SGB is still working on theeeﬁrst
steps of preparation before it
approaches the Athletic Depart-
ment.
‘ Gayman is working with Board
memberjames Landreneau, who
is responsible for contacting ad-
ministrators about this issue.
Gayman stressed that before
the Board moves forward with
any attempt to contact adminis-
trative ofﬁces, it must ﬁrst con-
nect with more student groups
interested in a change of policy.
“Right now, we’re focusing

on getting the word out there S

and reaching club sports who
want to have a say in this,” Gay-
man said. “We have to come to
a group understanding of what
we want to see come out of all of
this before we move forward.”

SGB reaches interested club
groups in a variety of ways, such
as through the Pittsburgh Sports
Network, an informational net-
working organization devoted
to sports issues.

And while it has met interest-
ed members of club wrestling
and women’s soccer teams, at-
tempts at wide-scale outreach
are unsuccessful so far.

“We’re reaching a communi-
cation barrier with contacting
people with a desire to use fa-
cilities for club sports,” Gay-
man said.

And with so many different
club sports who want to use

different game spaces, cohe-

sion has posed a problem for
moving forward with discus-
sion with the Athletic Depart-
ment.

“Everyone -is ridiculously
busy, and it’s hard,” Gayman
said. “We’re -addressing it day
by day and learning from our
mistakes.”I if i '

CASUAL

FRIDAYS    

Piss—poor Transportation

The Dutch might outdo Amer-
icans in numerous departments
— health care, quality of life —
but when it comes to sanitation,
they’re still, it seems, woefully
behind the times. The national
railway’s short—haul trains, for
example, still lack toilets; in
their place, according to. the
Associated Press, administra-
tors have introduced highly ab-
sorbent “pee-bags.” Although
politicians are less than pleased
with the solution, we think these
devices are a perfect ﬁt for Pitt’s
lecture halls, where bathroom
breaks can often prove disrup-
tive.

The Reluctant Leader

A Saddam Hussein look-
alike in Alexandria, Egypt, ex-
perienced more than second
thoughts after he refused a
$333,000 offer to the play the
erstwhile dictator in a porn ﬁlm.
Apparently convinced he was the
right man for the role, a gang of
black-suited assailants appre-
hended him on the street and
tried to force him into the back
of a van, according to Egyptian
publication Ahram Online. While
the ordeal was doubtlessly trau-
matizing, we’re happy, at least,
that the country’s revolution has
instilled in people a passion for
free-market enterprise.

Sperm Donor

No great culinary innovation,
apparently, goes unpunished.
Last Thursday, an Albuquerque
man pleaded guilty to offering

a bystander a semen-laced yo-
gurt sample, according to the
Associated Press. While we’re
disappointed that the recipe was
poorly received, we’re impressed
that the taster was able to iden-
tify the unusual ingredient.
Perhaps Cryos International,
the sperm bank that recently
banned redheads’ genes, could
use this person’s services.

Bridging a Legal Gap
Residents of New Castle, Pa.,

were doubtlessly torn between
feelings of dismay and awe when

4 a nearby 50-foot bridge was “sto-

len” sometime between Sept. 27
and Oct. 5. The bridge, which
was made of corrugated steel
cumulatively valued at roughly
$100,000, was disassembled us-
ing a blowtorch and likely sold
for scrap metal, according to the
Associated Press. On the bright
side, the crime’s perpetrators
are just the sort of pragmatic,
hardworking Americans that
President Barack Obama has
been waiting on to revitalize our
infrastructure. l

Back to Stool

Students, teachers and jani-
tors in Ocala, Fla., breathed
a collective sigh of relief last
weekend after police said they’d
nabbed a serial pooper, who
repeatedly squatted outside a
middle school classroom for a
quick number two, according to
The Gainesville Sun. His reasons
for committing such dastardly
defecations remain unclear, but
if we had to guess, we’d say he
just disembarked from a Dutch
train.

world would be a happier place.
Everybody just needs a double dose

Withfsteve jobs’ passing, how-
ever, analyses of his decision-
making’ style questioned this
attitude. Jobs’ great ideas — the
iPod, the iPhone, the iPad and the
MacBook — didn’t really follow
the smart money of theday (al-
though he indisputably had a ﬁrm
understanding of the markets). It
was in no way obvious that people
would want ﬂat tablets. No budget
projection would have predicted
20 million iPhone sales a quarter.
A more reasonable, clear—minded
CEO would have probably played
it safe and released another incre-
mental improvement to the PC.

That, of course, is exactly what
the rational people in charge of
Microsoft, HP and Cisco did. Ac-

cordingly, it’s unlikely that the
CEOs of these companies will be

eulogized to the same degreejobs»
was, although Bill«Gates might '
comeclose. And it’s certain that V

these companies won’t be valued
as highly. ‘ .
Although we all like to invoke

reason and logic, slavish follow- f ‘
. ers of this creed don’t make the

_world ‘move. We need ‘people to :
‘stay irrational — or “foolish,” in .

jobs’ words. .

If*you’l1 indulge me. for "a mo-
ment, I’m going to suggest that the
reason why so much of the world
seems broken — the reason unem-
ployment is so high fornew col-
lege graduates and why median
incomes have remained static since
the 1970s — is that we have too
many rational people.

To understand where I’m com-
ing from, you need to understand
how the world improves. Most
economists will tell you this hap-
pens when our productivity in-
creases. When we can create more
goods with the same amount of
resources, our quality of life
spikes.

The Industrial Revolution is the
best example of this phenomenon.
When mechanized fabric making
was introduced in the late 18th
century, all the hours that had
been spent sewing pilgrim hats

could suddenly be devoted to
other things while.the population
still produced the same amount

of hats. The worker or any other i

person could now occupy his ex-

cess time caring for a puppy. Magi— ~
cally, the world became one puppy.

happier. .

Of course, productivity needs
to improve faster than the birth
rate. Otherwise, all the new, happy

puppyowners will have babies and '

suck up all the extra resources.
Now here comes the part
where rational people ruined
things. When computing and ex-
tremely sophisticated statistical
techniques began to drive pro-
duction in the 1970s‘, everybody
could be more precise with their
predictions. Not to romanticize
too much, but before this, things
really were a lot like that famous
scene in “Apollo 13” in which the
engineers are given toys and told
to ﬁgure out how to get the astro-

. ‘nauts home safely. There Weren’t

sophisticated models to predict the
proﬁt projections of a new product.
Read an engineering paper from
the 19505 + the lack of speciﬁcity
is almost shocking. The best way
to move forward at all was to be

very risky.

Letter to the editor '

To the Editor,

I wanted to write a response
to the Oct. 12 editorial, “Smart
thinking: No guns at Pitt.” There
was a large amount of misinfor-
mation in this piece, so I wanted
to clear up the inconsistencies
quote by quote.

“...in’ short, we are glad Pitt
has a strict no-gun policy, re-
gardless’ of permit.”_

‘ Pennsylvania issues a License
to Carry‘Firearms, not a permit.
And yes, semantics are impor-
tant. t .

“It’s-true that those who will
commiticrimes in the ﬁrst place
won’t give Pitt’s policy a second
thought, but we think giving

every individual with a permit
the right to carry a gun on cam-
pus would do more harm than
good.”

The reason Seung—Hui Cho’s
Virginia Tech massacre was so
devastating was that he knew
anyone besides an officer was
unarmed.

“When those weapons are in
the hands of college students and
not professionals, the odds of
safety look dismal.”

Many people in law enforce-
ment are not ﬁrearm enthusiasts.
They qualify on their issued duty
weapon once or twice a year and
forget about it. The idea that ev-
eryone in that community is an

expert marksman is untrue.

“Imagine a gunshot rever—' .

berating through your freshman
dorm.”
In the state of Pennsylvania,

‘ Licenses to Carry Firearms are

issued to individuals who are
at least 21 and not restricted by
law to posses them. Only a tiny
minority of students in dorms
would qualify for an LTCF. In ad-
dition, Pitt could still enact a “no
firearms in the dorms” policy.

Murs sheds the dreads, ushers
in new era of ’90s-style-rap

When someone drops the name
“Nick Carter,” visions of Back-
street Boys —~ not Murs —
arise.

OK, so the Nick Carter of
Murs — short for “Making the
Universe Recognize and Sub-
mit” -— isn’t the ’90s boy band
member, but he should getjust
as much attention. The under-
ground hip-hopgartist from Los
Angeles just released his sev-
enth album. V

After struggling forthe past
14 years, Carter ﬁnally received

some commercial attention for
his 2008 album Mursfor Presi-

"dent, which hit No. 45 on U.S.
charts. A mix of Ice Cube and
Atmosphere, Murs’ ability to
cover a wide range of topics is
one ofthe reason it’s able to at-
tract fans ofvarious genres.

bum moves away’ from the tradi-

Before his most recent album, Murs cut off his signature dreadlocks

is not the only thing that has
changed about the West Coast
rapper. Cutting off his signature
dreadlocks, Carter has ushered
in a new era with producer Ski
Beatz, who provides a wide as-
sortment of beats to comple-
ment the artist’s well-rounded
style. ' R '

As in previous Murs albums,
storytelling is still one of the
rapper’s weapons of choice, but
the new Murs also embraced
a laid—back style, something
more typical of Californian rap-
pers. The change led Ski Beatz
to incorporate more horn and
saxophone samples, giving the
music a feel similar to that of
’90s rap. «

The first track, “Epic Saluta-
tions,” exemplifies Murs’ new
taste, with a flow softer than
his earlier more famous tracks,
“H-U—S—T—L—E” and “3:16.” The
song shows that the formerly
hard Murs is now willing to have
fun with his craft, switching his
storylines from cruising around

Cali in a Caddy to ﬂying around ,

space in a rocket ship.

He may be a changed man,
but Murs still knows how to re-
late to his fans, and songs like
“Remember 2 Forget” show that

anddeveloped a more mellow style.

Murs is just a regular guy who
goes through the same highs,
lows and breakups that we do.

Murs "also takes time on
the album to pay his respects
to West Coast rap. The track
“Easy—E” pays ‘homage’ to West
Coast rappers Ice Cube, Cor-
rupt, Hieroglyphics, Souls of
Mischief, Plan B and, of course,
Eazy—E over a laid—back beat
—~ the type of beat that have
become synonymous with the
hip-hop produced on the left
side of the country.

Although most ofthe album
has a relaxed, mellow feel, the
customary in-your-face sound
of Murs is still found on the

'track “316 Ways,” in which Murs

takes four minutes and eight

ALBUM REVIEW

Band Wavves goodbye .-

to summer

Patrick Wagner
Staﬂ’ Writer
Wavves
Life Sux .
Ghost Ramp Records
Grade: A- ‘

Rocks Like: Best Coast,]ayReatard,
Trash Talk —

With the wave of lo—ﬁ, California-
based bands that has appeared in the
past few years, you’ve got to wonder
if their proverbial summer is ever
going to end. With Life Sux, Wavves
ditches that summer in the best way
possible.

Instead of another pop-punk re-

cordwithacaliforniatheme, Nathan ,

Wlliams and company have created
an EP with a concentrated dose of
sunshine that could easily be a set of
anthems for any youth.

“Bug” leads off strongw ith apow-
erfully simple guitar riff that makes the
track particularly articulate. “You’re
always crashingparues /You’re always
crashing someone’s car,” Williams
sings in his signature snarl before tak-
ing his guitar — and the song — into
the stratosphere with one of Wawes’
famous guitar breakdowns.

Wavves is joined byToronto-based
group Fucked Up on the song “De-
stroy,” and their shared backgroundin

punk makes the collaboration shine.
Nihilism builds in the song’s musical
screams and compelling lead guitar
work. By the time the chorus of simply
“destroy” comes in, there’s a feeling of
rebellion emanating from the track.

There’s something prophetic
about “I Warma Meet Dave Grohl,”
not because of the song’s rock star"
focus, but because of the way Wavves
references the title track of their last
album, “King of the Beac .”

“Never gonna stop me,” he repeats,
and it’s hard to believe that anyone
could. The music is more controlled,
focusing less on the brazen style of
punk and moving towards —.— perhaps

’ deliberately‘— a style more akin to the
pp controlled rock of the Foo Fighters.

While Best Coast usually shines,
its singer Bethany Cosentino’s vocals _
on “Noddingoff” aren’t unleashed to T
theirfull effect The high-speed ballad
seems to lose the sentimentality that
Cosentino’s voice can so powerfully
convey. The effort is worthy, but the
execution in this particular case loses
what a female voice could uniquely
add.

Ending with a pop—infused
midtempo number named “Poor Le-
nore,” Life Sux is atremendous record
that has shown exactly what Nathan
Williams and the rest of Wawes can,’
create in California —— or anywhere
else. I

BASKETBALL

Panthers host
“preseason media day

    

by Mizia I S

Pitt men’s basketball coachjamie Dixon discusses the upcoming
season at a preseason media opportunity on Thursday.

Brody Engelhard
Staff Writer

Pitt freshmen Khem Birch and Mal-
colm Gilbert have already taken steps

D to prepare for their ﬁrst year of col-
legiate basketball.

Since arriving on campus, the
two have worked diligently to bulk
up, Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said
at the annual men’s and women’s
basketball preseason media oppor-
tunity on Thursday. For many Pitt
fans, the media opportunity signaled
the beginning of college basketball
season. .

The women’s team started prac-

_,_tice on Oct. 3, and the men’s teamwill

' hold its ﬁrst official practice today. -

But the athletes started preparing
for the season long before their ﬁrst
practices. For Birch and Gilbert, the
hard work is already paying off.

“The important thingto mention

‘t about those two guys is that they have
been here for about a month and a
half, and Khem put on 10 pounds and
Malco1m’s put on 14 pounds. So it just
goes to show what hard work and
being around guys that work hard

, will do,” Dixon said. '

Currently, Birch stands at 6-foot-9
and 220 pounds. Malcolm is 6—foot—11
and 235 pounds.

Sophomore walk-on Aron
Nwankwo said that Birch and Gil-
bert, along with John Johnson and

"" Durand Johnson, make up a solid
freshman class.

“They work hard, they play hard,
they’re talented and willing to learn,

and I think they are ready to really
help us out,” he said.

Birch, a McDonald’s All-Ameri-
can, and Gilbert join afrontcourt that

_ might be undermarmed before the 1

start of the season as senior forward
Nasir Robinson undergoes surgery
on his right knee this morning.

Pitt anticipates Robinson to sit

out three to four weeks and return in '

time for the Panthers’ Nov. 11 season
opener against Albany.

The surgery marks Robinson’s sec-
ond on his right knee. He had a torn
meniscus repaired last year, causing
him to miss the ﬁrst three games of
the season. Dixon said that the team
physicians don’t believe Robinson is
sufferingfrom another tear, but they
won’t know exactly what is causing
Robinson’s discomfort until begin-
ning the surgery.

Robinson averaged 9.4 points and L

4.9 rebounds for Pitt last season.

Dixon added that if the injury
keeps Robinson out of games, then
redshirt sophomore guard and for-
ward Lamar Patterson might make
an appearance in the post.

Even though Robinson is ex-
pected to return in time for the sea-
son opener, the men’s team is still
relatively young — but Dixon isn’t
concerned.

“Our four freshmen, as well as our
two redshirt freshmen, leave us with,
on paper, a young team, but we don’t
ever use that as an excuse,” he said.
“We anticipate those guys getting bet-
ter and helping us in a lot of ways.”

FOOTBALL

Pitt looks for win in last
nonconferencegame  

R] Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer

After a letdown performance
against Rutgers just a week after
its impressive victory over South
Florida, the_ Pitt football team will
look to riglit. itself in its last non-
conference,,game of the season.
The Panthers will take on the Utah
Utes (2-3, 0-3 Pac-12) Saturday at
Heinz Field. .

The noon matchup will be a
showdown between two teams that
have both struggled to ﬁnd consis-
tency this season.

“They’re kind of facing the same
type of deal as us,” Pitt head coach
Todd Graham said at a press con-
ference. “They’ve lost some games
that they shouldn’t have lost due to
turnovers. They’re_wounded and
hungry for a win, and this is going
to be a battle.”_ , 3 _.

The Utes started the season at
2-1 and looked like a dangerous
team after they almost upset South-
ern California on the road and then
demolished rival BYU 54-10 away
from home. 0

But Utah followed that state-

ment victory with back-to—back dis- L

appointinghome defeats, and the
team lost star quarterback Jordan
Wynn to a season—ending shoulder
injury in the process.

In last; year’s season opener, ~

Wynn tdfched the Pitt secondary
for 283 yards and three touchdowns
as the Utes held on to beat the Pan-
thers 27-24 in overtime.

Pitt redshirt senior defensive‘

tackle  Alecxih said facing the
Ute’s bziffkup quarterback won’t‘
change the Panthers’ mentality.

“It’s prérgt the guy we played last
year,”  “But at the same time,
we’re going to go forward like we
do every?_week. Respect everybody,
fear no Cone.” ‘

Wy  ’s replacement, juniorjon
Hays, t- rew three interceptions
in his ﬁrst start of the season last
week as Utah lost to’ Arizona State
35-14- . 

With ‘Wynn out, Utah will look
to running back John White, who

is averaging exactly 100 yards per
game on the season, to help the
Utes offense move theeball down
the ﬁeld. .

But the Pitt defense, for the

most part, has been able to control ‘

the line of scrimmage this season
and managed to hold Rutgers to a
miniscule 2.3 yards per rush last

, weekend.‘ A
“That’s something that we really -
emphasize on defense is stopping

the run,” redshirt senior defensive
tackle Myles Caragein said in an
interview. “[Utah’s] offensive line is

_ pretty good, so that’s a big challenge

for our defensive line.”

Utah head coach Kyle Whit-
tingham said -in a press confer-
ence that the Panthers “mix it up

on defense.”“They use a three- and A

four—man front, a four-deep sec-
ondary, a lot of quarters and some
zone pressure,” he said. “It’s a good

. challenge for us. They looked,ex-

ceptional against South Florida in
.a route at their place, but they are
coming off a tough loss to Rutgers
 -They are a good football team,
no question about it, and it should
be a challenge.”
The Panther offense will also face
a challenge, as the passing game has
been the root of the team’s consis-
tencyvproblems this season. A
- After turning the ball over four
times and giving" up sixsacks in
the Rutgers defeat, the ‘key to Sat-
~urday’s "game might bethow well
the Panthers take care of the ball

against at Utah defense-which", has , .
, roski’s'historic home run, Skornickel

forced 13 turnovers and recorded
nine sacks in its ﬁrst ﬁve games.
“They are very well-coached,”
Graham said. “They are going to

- play hard, tackle well and be sound

about what they’re doing.”
Pitt junior running back Ray
Graham currently leads the na-

tion with 899 total rushing yards, 0

but quarterback Tino Sunseri and
the offensive line must perform
better in order for the offense to
run as efﬁciently as it did against
South Florida and in spurts against
Iowa. ,

     REMEMBERING GAME 7: _ FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND T
  PIRATES FANS GATHER TO RELIVE PRNACY ACT (FERPA)

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
. ‘ ‘ ’ , cation records: These rights include: »
. M _  M  S  E  N ' ~ The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives
« t G . M . . . .. g , _ , , .. .. .. ‘ .. , a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other
f ‘ T _ appropriate program director, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University offi-
cial will make arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may be in-
spected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that offi-
ciat shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
- The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer~
sity ofﬁcial responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it
is inaccurate.
If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notiﬁed of the right to a
hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure 09-08-01.
- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable information contained in the student's
_ education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which
: permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school
official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supen/isory, academic or research, or support

versity has contracted (such asan attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person sewing on the Board of Trust-
ees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an-
other school oflicial in performing his or her tasks. A school ofﬁcial has a legitimate educational interest if the offi-
cial needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University will disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which ‘a student seeks or
V intends to enroll. The University will forward records on request of another school.

- The right to ﬁle a complaint with the US. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by University of
Pittsburgh to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers
FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance Office
U.S. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
