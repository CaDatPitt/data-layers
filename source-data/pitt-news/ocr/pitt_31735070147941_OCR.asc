him to have a psychological eval-

Noah Gorelick sits in the chair with
a nervous smile on his face. The
hairdresser standing behind him
prepares to shear off the remain-
der of his formerly shoulder-length
hair, the majority of which is now
sprinkled on the blue tarmac below
him. Senior Amanda Russell begins
a chant.

Senior Grace Duffy, standing nearby
and taking pictures of the scene,

Gorelick’s smile eases into a
laugh and the hairdresser ﬁnishes
the job. .

Gorelick, a professor at Pitt’s

’ Graduate School of Public Health,

runs his hand over his buzzed head,
feeling for the scar on the left side,
by his ear. This is his ﬁrst haircut
since the surgery two and a half
years ago that removed a benign
brain tumor.

“It signiﬁes that I’ve grown past
having to hide the scar,” Gorelick
said. “It’s nice to be on the other
side and help out people who still
need some help.”

Gorelick was one of more than

It’s the only thing standing between Pitt
students and four months of summer — a
time of Scantron sheets, late—night cram ses-
sions and hours in front of computer screens
churning out papers.

In other words: It’s time for ﬁnals.

And there’s one University group at-
tempting to pull students away from their
textbooks, at least for a little while. 1

builds up as the semester dwindles down.
Running this coming Monday through Friday
—— the week before scheduled ﬁnals — the
Pitt Program Council’s events will offer a
variety of stress relievers, including a spa
day and a tie-dye session.-

“It’s meant to provide free activities that
are stress—free for students so they can re-
lease their stress before ﬁnals and have things
to do other than those related to school,” said
Rachel Kasab, recently elected director of
the public relations committee. .

Students can ﬁnd a full schedule of events

on the Pitt Program Council’s website, www.
pitt.edu/~ppc/.

Kasab said that between 30 and 50 stu-
dents generally attend each event, with larger
numbers turning out for the craft events.

“My favorite is Day at the Spa because,
why wouldn’t you want to go and get a free

haircut/manicure for free when you typi— -

said. '

aged to donate their hair to the Locks of Love
charity, which manufactures wigs for children
living with cancer and other diseases.

Gorelick’s cheerleader Russell also hap-
pens to be the founder of Pitt’s Buzzing 4
Change program. -

Pitt is one of only four universities in the
country to host the annual event. Russell
brought the hair—shearingfundraiser to cam-
pus last year after learning about the group
from her friendjudah Ferst. Ferst initiated the
program on George Washington University’s
campus in 2002.

Pitt’s Buzzing4 Change president, senior
Christiana Thurton, was thrilled by the large

said before giving the hairdresser the go-
ahead to buzz off his shoulder-length hair.

For Stavriotis, the choice to donate wasn’t
as much related to the purpose of the event
as it was the weather.

“It’s getting warm out and this hair’s like
a hat,” he said. “I was eating lunch and some
girls walked by and asked, ‘Do you want to cut
your hair today?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ And they were
kinda like, ‘Woah!’ I ﬁgured if it’s going to help
someone at Children’s, why not?” '

Professional hairdressers from Supercuts
donated their time for the event.

“This is our day off, and we chose to come
here and do this,” said Carly Craig, a hair-

Zack Stavriotis, channeling Wiz Khalifa:

Everything I do, I do it big.

turnout. “There’s been a nice steady ﬂow of
people,” she said. “I feel we might make more
money this year than last year.”

Russell estimated the total amount raised
to be about $2,500, but didn’t have the ﬁnal
tally yet. The event raised about $2,000 last
year. .

Some students opted to buzz off all their
hair for the event, while others went for a
simple trim.

“I have split ends,” senior Sarah Sandrian
said when asked her reason for participat-
ing. She quickly added, “But it’s also a good
cause.” ‘ 7

Senior Lauren Perwas had a more personal
reason for donating some of her long black
hair. In high school, her friend’s sister died
of cancer. Since then, Lauren and her_friends
from home have periodically donated their
hair to Locks of Love.

“This is the fourth time I’ve donated hair,”
Perwas said.

Junior Zack Stavriotis used the words of
rapper Wiz Khalifa when it came time to de-
ciding the fate his long blond locks.

type of charity event.”
For the event, senior Brett Schupack also
volunteered as a D] to pump up the crowd.
Pitt’s Buzzing 4 Change program is run
by an eight—member board. The group count-
ed on volunteers from a number of student
groups, including service fraternity Alphi Phi
Omega, honor society Omicron Delta Kappa
and the Hillel Jewish University Center.‘
Though the annual Buzzing ‘4 Change
event is the group’s primary focus, its mem-
bers also raised money this year through
pizza sales, a fundraising event at Pamela’s
Diner and online proﬁles that members use
to request donations from friends and family
in other cities or. states. Before the Buzzing4 ~

a Change event began, the group had already

gathered more than $1,400 for-Children’s
Hospital.

At times, the wait for a haircut reached
30 minutes yesterday afternoon.

“I’m surprised by the number of girls who,
on impulse, cut their hair,” Russell said. “It’s
awesome.” . '

voted to repeal a town standard
that prohibited nude dancing from
taking place within a quarter-mile
of any residence or business), op-
ponents began gathering signa-

supplied its answer: No naked

As April rolls along and we hear back
from potential summer employers,
rejection hurts, especially when it
seems likely to halt our future plans.
But there’s no need to feel helpless.

A few weeks ago, I was sitting
around a house with some friends
and we started talking about a song
called “Helplessness Blues.”

home, just not the books that I was supposed
to —— Iwas a little farther along than my peers.
I didn’t want to waste my time on “The Giver,”
because I had read it two years before. Is that
a self-starter? Obviously, this isn’t the kind of
story to include in a cover letter to a potential
employer. The problem is, I don’t know how
to show how I am a self—starter if I’m just writ-
ing what they want to hear. I’m told to cater
to what speciﬁc internships or applications
are looking for, but what if catering to them

means that I’m not really the kind of person
that they’re looking for? What if I get a job by
pretending to be something that I’m not, and
I’m miserable? Cue the helplessness blues.
But as a good friend advised me rnid-panic
attack, sometimes a seemingly hopeless and/

. or wasted time isn’t wasted at all. Sometimes

it gives you space to do exactly the things you
want to do. My reading teacher gave me lunch
detention for not doing my homework three

days in a row, and I loved it. For once I could.

sit alone, eat my smelly egg salad and not look
like a freak. When you stop worrying so much
about the consequences, it’s easier to ﬁnd
space to live. I go to class and I study, but it’s
certainly not to get a Dean’s List certiﬁcate in
the mail. Someday I’ll ﬁnd a job or internship
that likes me for me, and it will mean more to
me than a line on my resume signifying that I
marked all the right boxes in my life.
Helplessness is astate of mind, I think, and
a second choice can turn out to have its beneﬁts

too. Why not spend another summer on the
porch? Maybe I’ll regret it in the long run —
just like I’ll regret sleeping through class when
exam time comes around —— but for those 20
minutes, I’m going to enjoy my rest. And for
these next three months, I’m going to enjoy
my Plan Z, gadumit. Who knows how many
aimless summers I have left. ’

Pitt Rep hosts bumpy but re

Ben Labe
Staﬁ’ Writer

“Henna Night” and “Sparagmos”
Now - Sunday

Studio Theatre in the Cathedral
of Learning basement

Student tickets $8 at the door,
$13 online

Grade: B

In a double feature that will run
through Sunday, the members
of Pitt Repertory Theatre dem-
onstrate the versatility of their
talents and tastes.

The two plays, showing
together in the Cathedral of
Learning’s cozy Studio Theater,
have little in common. “Henna
Night” and “Sparagmos,” which
run at about an hour apiece,
were written in very different
times and convey very differ-
ent themes. “Henna Night” is a
modern, ‘urban play about the
interactions of women, whereas
“Sparagmos” is an adaptation of
a traditional Greek tragedy.

“Henna Night,” directed by
Pitt senior Jess" Edelstein, is
the better of the two plays. It
contains just one scene, which
takes place in the apartment of
the recently heartbrokenJudith
(junior Chelsea McCune). The
story begins with an introduc-
tory voicemail in which Judith
begs her ex—boyfriend Jack to

take her back. She is desperate. -

She even hints at the possibility
of a pregnancy.

When the voicemail ends,
Judith answers a visitor at her
door. Instead of finding Jack,
however, she discovers his new
lover, Ros, played by sophomore
Chelsea Strub.

The whole play is an account
of the ensuing conversation be-
tweenJudith and Ros. Judith is
understandably contemptuous
of Ros’ perceived homewreck-
ing capabilities, but Ros de-
fends her actions intelligently
and gracefully. By the end, both
characters come to deserve our

_ sympathy.

The play earns high marks
across the board. Its great suc-
cess is its levelheaded treatment
of the characters’ viewpoints

and the wonderfully nuanced
acting of McCune.and Strub.
While it would have been easy
for London—based playwright
Amy Rosenthal to portray Ros
as a villain, she smartly avoids
it. Nor does she portray Judith
as irreconcilably bitter or in-
ept

and witty, making use of invent-
ed truisms while elaborating on
old ones. Although the women’s
pretext for meeting is their mu-
tual, but obviously conflicting,
fondness for the same man, the
play is not really about him at
all. It is about the compassion
and complexity of the women.
It is enjoyable to watch as their

_ relationship subtly evolves and

they begin to understand each
other. A

The David Bisaha-directed .

“Sparagmos,” on the other
hand, is a flawed production.
Based upon Greek playwright
Euripides’ “The Bacchae,” it
contains all of the traditional
themes ofa Greek drama, along
with some of the pitfalls.

Enraged by the people of
Thebes for scrutinizing his cus-
toms, the god Dionysus swears
retribution against the city’s
ruler Pentheus, who is brazen
and hubristic. Pentheus is ap-
palled by the Bacchic customs
that are sweeping through rural
Greece and is willing to fight
off those who would introduce
them to his city. _

The Bacchae are a group of
Theban women whom Dionysus
has possessed. Their behavior
alternates from serene to sav-
age, at the god’s command. At
one moment they sit, beauti-
fully poised, in the forest. In the
next, they are tearing through
a bull’sflesh as if,it were cel-
lophane. To punish Pentheus,
Dionysus disguises himself as
a man and attempts to lure him
toward the Bacchae.

There are scenes in which
the Bacchae perform worship
dances for their god. The ac-
tresses are hardly dancers, but
they perform the choreography
well enough. -The accompany-
ing music, particularly the song
“Cosmic Love” by Florence and

The dialogue is both delicate .

Judith , played by junior Chelsea McCune (left), and Ros, played

The Machine, suits the dances
perfectly.

But “Sparagmos” suffers
from a small budget and ex-
cessive acting. Of course, Pitt
Rep can hardly be blamed for
the first, but this is clearly a
play that requiresmore scene
changes and special effects than
either such an ill-equipped the-
ater or such a scant budget can
permit. However, Bisaha, a Pitt
doctoral student, makes do with
what he has.

Tragedy is certainly a diffi-
cult medium to perform. When
actors are supposed to be hys-
terical, many have a tendency
to stress too many of their syl-
lables. They lose their patience
and forget to breathe. Instead
of speaking from their dia-
phragms, they begin to speak
high up in their throats. Some
of the actors in “Sparagmos”
fall into that trap, and at times
I wanted a change in the dynam-
ics of their voices.

_Overall, “Henna Night” and
“Sparagmos” make for an en-
tertaining — if at times uneven
—_ two hours.

hometown enthusiasm.

“It’s kind of surreal. I’ve never

“The band’s music is grounded in‘hip-

with rock, soul, funk and modern inﬂuenc-
es,” Nash said.

i In addition to expanding the musical
palatte, Turner remarked that his main re-
sponsibility as a hip-hop artist and song-
writer is to give the public a chance to rec-
ognize the difference between “fast food and

a home-cooked meal.” He does this by using -

his talent to share “pieces of wisdom” that
don’t, as “fast—food” hip-hop does, deal with
the topics of drugs, money or women.

Others in the industry have praised the
band’s wholesome approach to the genre..

“When I think about Formula412, I
think about their roots. They bring more
to the table than The Roots themselves,”
said Dwayne Muhammad, founder of the
annual Pittsburgh Hip—Hop Awards. “ [The
band] encompasses everything that is cut-
ting edge about hip-hop music. I’m listening
to their song ‘Step to the Rear’ right now. I
love their energy,” he said, speaking about
the ﬁrst song on the new album.

Turner said that the inspiration for his

band’s lyrics, including those of “Step to the ‘

Rear,” often derives from the band’s experi-

ences, or even from the members’ casual.

Pitt not looking past lowly Hoyas this Weekend

"’ Panthers travel to Bethesda, Md., for series against Georgetown as Baker closes in on record books

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt has already zoomed past
Georgetown in the Big East
baseball standings. And this
weekend, the Panthers hope to
continue that trend.

The Panthers have used dis-
cipline at the plate and a white-

""'hot, deep offense to surge to

within one game of the confer-
ence lead. The Hoyas can’t say
the same.

The two teams will meet for a
three-game series this weekend
in Bethesda, Md., and although
the Hoyas have struggled to put
runs on the board in April, Pitt
senior outﬁelder Zach Duggan
said Georgetown is better than
its record suggests.

“Georgetown is a much im-

e" “proved team,” he said. “I know

when we used to play George-
town, it was kind of like any-
thing less than a sweep was a
disappointment. But they’re a
better team this year. It’s going
to be a dogﬁght.”

The Hoyas (18-17, 1-8 Big
East) have lost eight of nine
games this month and have been
shut out twice in the past week.
But as Pitt head coach Joe Jor-

M: dano pointed out, all but one of
’ their Big East losses have been

by two runs or fewer.
“Georgetown is a well-
coached and talented team,”
Jordano wrote in an e—mail
Wednesday. “They have lost

” several games by a run or two.

They will be well-prepared for

us, and it will be a challenging.

weekend.”
Jordano emphasized that Pitt
(19-12, 6-3 Big East) can’t worry

.;__ about Georgetown’s struggles

and should focus on its own
game.

“We have to play our game,”
he wrote. “Regardless of who we
are playing or where we are play-
ing, we have to focus on things

“' we control.”

Shortstop Mike Garza leads
the Hoyas with a .358 batting av-
erage, but the rest of the lineup

has struggled to drive in run-
ners during the drought. No. 2
University of Virginia held them
to two hits in a rain-shortened,
five-inning game Tuesday, and
they haven’t scored more than
four runs in any Big East game.

Pitt, on the other hand, has
overwhelmed opponents with its
offensive production recently.
The Panthers put up 31 runs in
last weekend’s series against
Villanova, and catcher Kevan
Smith won Big East Player of
the Week for his efforts against
the Wildcats.

But the offense hasn’t relied
on Smith, or any single player
for that matter. Three differ-
ent Panthers have won Big East
Player of the Week this year, and
Pitt has four of the conference’s
top-12 hitters in terms of bat-
ting average. Each series has
produced a different star.

Jordano has preached pa-
tience at the plate and aggres-
siveness on the base paths, and
that philosophy has permeated
the entire lineup during the re-
cent offensive outburst.

“We are swinging the bats
well,”]ordano wrote. “The rea-
son is we are executing our of-
fensive plan  Any one of our
players_has a chance to excel
each weekend.”.

The team faced a setback,
though, when Pitt went on the
road Wednesday night. The
Panthers lost, 5-4, in an out-
of-conference matchup against
Penn State. Smith drove in two
runs in the loss.

Pitt will send Matt Iannazzo
to the mound in the series open-
er Friday night, Jordano said.
Freshman Ethan Mildren, who
hasn’t walked a batter in 41.1
innings this season, will pitch
Saturday night. i

Jordano wrote that Corey
Baker will start in the series
ﬁnale Sunday afternoon. One
more victory would allow Baker
to break the school record for
most career wins. He is cur-
rently tied with Tedde Campbell,
whose 21 careerwins have re-
mained the record since 1995.I

TASSER’S TAKE .

Basebal|’s rep tarnished,
but its excitement builds

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Major League Baseball hit another

low this past week, as more of last ’

decade’s stars lost their credibil-
ity. ’

In a time when baseball should
be trying to reclaim some of its

lost popularity from the money-

hungry NFL, it instead continues
to pick up the pieces resulting

from its recurring scandals. Yet,
while baseball is starting to lose
its prestige, it is simultaneously
gaining in its excitement.
Controversial home run -king
Barry Bonds was convicted of
one count of obstruction of. jus-
tice Wednesday —— for giving an

evasive answer under oath more

than seven years ago. Three other
counts he faced were thrown out
—— one for lying about steroid use,

one for lying about human growth
hormone use and one for lying
about receiving an injection from
someone other than a doctor.
The seven-day trial ended
nearly seven years‘ of legal bat-
tles against Bonds. His conviction
comes on the heels of dreadlocked
and free-spirited outﬁelder Man-
ny Ramirez’s latest tribulation.

Steroid Era not all bad

Tasser< 8

Ramirez, the former Boston Red Sox
superstar, retired from the Tampa Bay
Rays last week after he learned he faced a
100-game suspension for failing arsecond
drug test.

A second failed test certainly cannot
simply be explained using the popular
phrase “Manny being Manny.” The care-
free outﬁelder is often given a break for his
follies in leftﬁeld and awkward interaction
with fans, but this is a much more serious
offense. His ﬁrst failed test came in 2009,
when Ramirez was a member of the Los
Angeles Dodgers. ‘

Now the question I ask you is this: “Was
the Steroid Era really that bad?”

I, as part of the minority, say no. Base-

ball’s history islitteréd with cheating ——

was caught stealing a record 42 times that
year). V
Despite all those trends erased from

I today’s game, should they be tossed from

the record book? I think not.

Besides, at its peak, the Steroid Era did
something for baseball — and the coun-
try.

Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa’s epic
summer of home runs in 1998 helped revive
baseball from its deathbed —- where it was
sent after the 1994 players’ strike (are you
listening NFL?) — and I will never forget it.
Fans were glued to their seats all summer
to see if either of the two could break Roger
Maris’ single—season home run record of
61, which both proceeded to‘ do.

What little boylin all of the country at

Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa’s epic    
summer of home runs in 1998 helped
revive baseball from its deathbed, Where it

and it’s a widely accepted part of the game.
From stealing signs to spitballs, baseball
has embraced the mantra, “It ain’t cheating
if you don’t get caught.” .

Old school fans will argue about the sa-
credness of records. My retort is a big, fat,
“Who cares?” Personally, I love baseball
statistics and records.

But that is why I recognize that baseball
goesthrough certain eras that profoundly
affect the way the garfhe is played and the
records that are produced. -

lWhat‘about'Cy Young’s 511 wins‘? In his
era, pitchers pitched every inning, every

fourth day. Closers, lefty specialists and-

middle relievers weren’t even heard of.
And Rickey Henderson’s stolen-base
record of 130 stolen bases in one season,
should that be tossed out too? Every team
ran way more in the,1980s (Henderson

that time didn’t want to be McGwire, whose
jacked arms were crushing homers left and
right? Or Roger Clemens, whose death stare

‘ on the mound before he ﬁred afastball un-

derneath the batter’s chin gave viewers the
willies? Or Sammy Sosa, whose home run
hop and complicated kiss—chest-point at the
sky was imitated all around the country?

My bottom line is this: Most players
were on steroids —and power was the
evolution of the game. Instead of hating
the game that basically encouraged it (no
steroid testing at the time) and the players
(chasing the glory and their paychecks),
look instead at yourself. If you were in their
shoes, could you realistically say that you
wouldn’t even think of doing the same? If
you said no, then you might be lying. I’m
not saying I would have taken that route,
but hindsight is always 20/20. I
