Black Studies

‘Circular’ Curriculum Proposed

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

The two authors of A Black Pa-
per on Black Studies defined the
need for and the structure of the
proposed School of Black Studies
at the University before an au-
dience of more than one hundred
in the SU Ballroom last Thurs-
day at noon.

Dr. Jack Daniels, Speech de-
partment, and Curtiss Porter, of
the Black Action Society (BAS).
co-chaired the seminar. Porter
stressed the importance of a cir-
cular education for black people."

Porter explained the circular
curriculum as “full knowledge of
the place of the black man in
the world.

“In a circular curriculum, stu-
ding one area of human life means
studying all the other areas,
bringing in literature, black econo-
mics, the natural sciences, etc.”
Porter went on.

Enlarging on Porter’s com-
ments, Daniels insisted that a de-
partment as opposed to a school is
not a viable alternative for a
black studies program.

“In the field of English alone,
there is need for specialization
on every significant writer. As
there are specialists on Robert

USOE GRANT

A $5.6 million grant from the
U. S. "Office of Education will en-
able the University to build an
eight story building to carry out
frontier research in education.

The grant was announced in
Washington and at a press confer-
ence recently in the office of
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar.

The University grant is part of’
a $14-million package awarded by

Frost and Hemingway, there
should be specialists on Leroy
Jones,” he said.

He further objects to the de-
partmental structure because a
department in the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences (FAS) must fol-
low the guidelines of the FAS
Council.

“Course outlines, appointments

of faculty members and grading-

procedures should be under the
control of the Black Studies
Council,” believed the speaker.

The structure of a School of
Black Studies here as expounded
by the speakers and expanded by
the Black Paper on Black Stu-
dies, breaks down roughly as fol-
lows:

—Departmental divisions co-
ordinated by a Vice-Chancellor
of Afro-American affairs or a
black Provost. The school would
be headed by the Dean of the
School of Black Studies.

—Community institutes designa-
ted geographically, extending
University work and dealing
with community issues such as
food problems, sanitation, etc.

——Research institutes.

Under the present University-

structure, a self-designated major
may be worked out in Black Stu-

the U.S.0.E. to Pitt, the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley and _
Stanford University to enable the
nation’s top researchers and scho-
lars in education to develop a
concentrated attack on the nation’s
educational problems and to im-
prove learning in the classroom.

Dr. Posvar also disclosed that:
the Learning Research and Devel-
opment Center has received an op-
erating grant of $230,200 from
the -National Science Foundation.

dies. The projected school idea
would provide a degree in Black
‘Studies.

According to Porter, the all-in-
elusive. ie. circulear, curriculum
of the -proposed school will affect
black students in a five step pat-
tern.

v

“The first step,’ averred Por-
ter “is awareness-—awareness of
the situation of the world today
and the black man’s place init.
This would lead to recondition-
ing the minds of black students.”

The stage following awareness
is catharsis, “vomiting out the
unclean lies about self, readjust-
ing the sights and moving past ro-
manticism.”

From awareness and catharsis
evolves black functioning.

“Black students must take their

munity, doing black things for
black people. What is needed is
a spiritual and cultural base as

well as a real set of political ideas,”

stressed Porter.

The fourth stage of black’ de-
velopment involves work in com-
munal groupings, thus the em-
phasis in the Black Studies School
on the community.

The final evolution is libera-
tion. “That will not occur at the
University,” impressed Daniels
“but in the community where
black people are.”

“We are operating in a sys-
tem in which 35 million black
people are held in a powerful ed-
ucational, scientific, cultural
bondage. We must fully study the
monkey on our backs. We must un-
derstand and realize a concern for
the black man in this world.”

which LRDC pioneered several
years ago.

The new LRDC building will

to develop experimental equip-

Associate Editor

Fog clouded the highway and Tom’s eyes were straining to
see the faded white lines along the bend of -the road. He slowed
to 45, turned the radio low and looked at Janey slumbering next
to him.

Then he thought back to their fatalistic futuristic coup. it
was a spur of the moment idea they had to drive to Florida that
Wednesday night. They had had several drinks. and with an im-
pish air about them, just said, “Why not .. 

Both had class assignments due the next day; Tom even
had to go to work that night. But as Tom kept the car on his side
of the two lane highway, he knew it was one of those things you
just do . . . “To do,” he barked aloud.

Janey stirred, and snuggled up against Tom's leg. He put
his hand on her cheek.

“SO MANY PEOPLE are essentially mad to condemn
themselves forever‘ to a methodic way ofliving,“ he thought.

deny themselves the liberty and freedom of life.

thing. week after week after week.

was better

They live from week to week, leaving Saturday night as the hnly
day to free themselves. 1

WITH HIS EYES groping for the white lines of the road,
Tom was becoming sleepy, and decided to pull over at a rest stop
and sleep for the night.

When he and Janey awoke the/next morning, they stopped

for breakfast and hit the road once again.

Janey looked at her watch, “Eleven-thirty," she said. 

“Hey I should be in English class. I’ll have a cut against
me,“ Tom chuckled, laughing at society. “This is like running
away from home. It's like saying the heck with everything, and
just taking-off.“ 

“You know Janey, we‘re doing something that I’ll betcha a
whole lot of other kids want to do down deep inside, but niever
do it.“ _Tom inserted. “It's just a love of freedom and new places
that makes us go. — ‘:

“JUST THE CHANGE means so much, because when? you
get back to what you left, everything is put into a better perspec-
tive. Life seems a little better, a little freer. ‘ '

“When you do get back‘, it makes you feel better abouteyour
responsibilities to others. You see them in a clearer light. When
you go off to new adventures, you grow in yourself. You’re a‘-_bet—
ter person for your friends and relatives. Everything is better.”

For Tom, everything was better. He had jumped out of the
mainstream of life and made himself the target of fate.

He and Janey always had good times together, but this time
would be the best. They knew it.

' Janey rubbed the back of Tom’s neck, and he turned to see

her smiling. Neither of themsaw the oncoming car. .

notes from underground

Bedford, New Hampshire
July 15, 1967

. . . . Life as'an abstract concept is meaningless. A life, one man’s life, isn’t. Each man must fine a pursuit
and follow it. This pursuit should benefit not deprive others. One man can change the existence of all others — for
better or for worse. But no man can give mankind’s existence a purpose. One can only make things more tolerable,
not more comprehensible.

Pittsburgh
February 9, 1968

I have finally learned how to live life by enjoying each moment for what it is, for the next may not exist.
Occasionally I lapse into_the frenzied hours of the “old days” when all I thought of was the tomorrows to come
and how wonderful they would be. But the today’s were so empty —— I lived in a real vacuum. I am so busy — to
look at an enumeration of my activities you would
think so anywhow. SG Senator, Student for McCar-
thy, ISO member, Dorm Council representative
desk assistant, student, dental patient, date, daughter,
sister, friend, enemy, individual, conformist, scholar,
party-girl, wall-flower. Yes I am all those things —
each at a different time, sometimes several simula-
taneously, occasionally almost all of them at once —
those are the moments I hate. What I love is to forget
all these and relax — like now — be alone, and think
about nothing.

Pittsburgh
February 20, 1968

No real ambition to study, but a great thirst for
knowledge. I want to know everything—but the tedium
of study distracts me. How can Dr. Sternfelt expect
me to appreciate classical symphonies and under-

must waste my time memorizing piano, forte, mo-
tive x and y? My grades will undoubtably be low
this term, but remarkably —— I am learning more than
ever before. I have read Rod McKuen and Ferling-
hetti to become more exposed tocontemporary writ-
ing. But no drive to study in my courses. . . . Every-
thing seems irrelevant. I just want to float in this vac-
cuum-like existence on campus. Yet I'don’t want to
float, I want to swim; I want to get somewhere, do
something, be someone. I am only happy with
people. No ,— I am not afraid to be alone, afraid to
face my own mind and thoughts. But I can’t stand
the stagnancy of college life. Four years of acheiv—
ing nothing. All gains are personal —— nothing for so-
ciety . . . Oh God! Help me V—_ help me pull my-
self from this pit (Pitt).

I try to call a spade a spade. I want to be honest. In factI strive for a Confucian-like existence, but I often
become confused with the degree to which I should conform to society’s demands.

Society expects certain things of an individual which I don’t feel one can ignore without repudiating so-
ciety and jeopardizing one’s existence.

Drugs, marijuana specifically, are big on the campus scene . . . Good God — one wonders if “civilization”
is worth the price we pay by being faced with these novel situations. Maybe it is our society that is warped in its re-

I remember last spring when self-liberation in other areas led me to liberate myself in the academic sphere.
I cut a number of classes and renigged on various commitments to work in the McCarthy campaign,readRod Mc-
Kuen, and listen to records. This summer — whether due to accidental lu_ck or unconscious planning I have four to
six weeks with only one commitment — four hours of tennis a week. . . . I put down my astrology reading at 1 a.m.

Brenda is a girl with a problem.
Brenda is the girl who is the cen-
tral character of Good-Bye, Col-
umbus, playing at the Chatham
Cinema downtown.

Brenda plays these little

her lover, but mainly with her-
self. ,

Brenda pretends that she is
not guilty about sex, that she is
not guilty about deceiving her
parents, that she is not control-
led by the status trap that her par-
ents nouveau affluence has set.
But, oh, she is.

The funny storyline-that-is-
not-really-funny concerns a love
affair between country club
Brenda and librarian Neal. The
heroine (make up your own mind)
tries to get rid of her conflict be-
tween what she wants to do and
what she can justify in two ways.

She tries to pretend it isn’t
there. She calls Neal out on his

in a swimming pool in an attic.

But these measures will not do
it, so she subconsciously does
her best to get caught.

having to face herself eventually
