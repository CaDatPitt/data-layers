A Pittsburgh judge yesterday suggested
Pitt’s Tri—Delta Sorority chapter be decertiﬁed
following the testimony of an 18-year-old
woman who said she drank at a private sorority
party and was sexually assaulted by her 19-year-
old date.

“She became so intoxicated  she remem-
bered almost nothing until she woke up naked the
next morning in her date’s dormitory room, on
blood-stained sheets,” Judge Dan Butler said in a
letter to Chancellor Nordenberg. Her injuries
were not speciﬁed in the letter.

The unidentiﬁed woman attended “Bring-
A-Date night” April 24 at Loafers Restaurant &
Bar downtown, where Tri—Delta sisters, pledges
and guests had access to an open bar, the letter
stated.

According to her testimony, she drank at
least four shots of liquor and nearly two pitchers
of beer, and no bar employees made any effort to
check her age, Butler said. She said her only clear
memory of the evening was when she refused to
have sexual intercourse with her date.

Butler indicated in the letter he thought Tri-
Delta members knew of the violations at the

“If an official University sorority had not
held a party at which underage drinking was per-
mitted, even encouraged ——- this incident might
have never taken place,” Butler said in the letter,
obtained from WTAE Channel 4 reporter
Sheldon Ingram.

Butler encouraged Pitt Police Chief Furka,
Pittsburgh Police Chief McNeil1y and Sgt.
Seibert of the Pa. Liquor Control Board to take
action against adults involved. None could be
reached for comment.

“In that vein, I would expect that the
University would take whatever steps are
required to decertify Tri—Delta Sorority so that no
further incidents of this type can take place under
University auspices,” the letter continued.

Decertiﬁcation involves a sorority or frater-
nity losing its status as a University-affiliated
group.

However, it is too early for Pitt to consider
decertiﬁcation, according to University
spokesman Ken Service.

“It really wouldn’t be fair to pre-judge, and
the University will give serious attention to the
allegations,” he said.

For The Pitt News

Some professors who have par-
ticipated in Pitt’s new retirement
plan intend to remain at the
University to concentrate on their
own research endeavors after the
retirements take effect.

Most of these professors are in
the natural sciences division of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. FAS
washardest hit by early retirements,
losing 59 faculty members.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said he '

thinks many retiring faculty will
continue to do research at Pitt.
However, these professors will

be responsible for acquiring and
maintaining the funds necessary for
their research. Koehler added that
any retirees staying on to continue

research are viewed as retired by the

University and must have external
funding to subsidize their work.

“Faculty members have a cer-
tain amount of research they want to
do before they [retire],” he said.
“They get to be 60 or 65 and
approach the end of their careers not
having accomplished all of their
professional goals. They think ‘If I
could just concentrate on doing
these projects, then I think I can get
them done before my time runs
out.’”

Frank Tabakin, chairman of the
department of physics and astrono-
my, said professors will be given the
use of University equipment, labs
and offices only as space and fund-
ing permits.

He added that six of the eight
professors who agreed to the early
retirement plan in his department
will stay at Pitt to conduct research.
If their funding should dwindle,
their space will shrink.

Also, Tabakin said as new facul-
ty are hired, accommodating their
needs for office and lab space will
take priority.

SGB, Wallach propose
upgrade of A+ to 4.25

Heather Barnett
For The Pltt News

If a proposal to change the way
Pitt calculates grade point averages is
enacted, students earning an A+ will
soon be getting more than a boost to
their self-esteem.

The Student Government Board is
lobbying Pitt administration to adjust
the calculation of QPAs so that an A+
would be assigned an extra .25 quali-
ty points.

Currently, grades of A and A+ are
both counted as 4.0 in Pitt’s grading
system, despite the fact that an extra
quarter-point credit is given for all
other “plus” grades.

If approved by the University, the
proposal would be retroactive, mean-
ing that all A+ grades a student
earned in the past would count for
4.25 quality points on his transcript,
according to SGB President Alyson
Wallach.

The proposed change in grading
policy has merit, according to
Frederick Koloc, College of Arts and
Sciences director of advising.

“I’ve always thought that students
should get some extra credit for an
A+, because it’s really terribly ironic
that if a student has all As, but one A-
, they won’t have a 4.0,” he said.

The Academic Affairs Committee
has been in contact with University
administration to investigate the fea-
sibility of the proposal. While the
idea in principle appears to have sup-
port, such a policy, change would
have to be approved by the Faculty
Council or the Board of Trustees,
Wallach said.

This adjustment in Pitt’s grading
policy has been discussed in the past,
Koloc said, but faculty concerns

about grade inﬂation prevented its
enactment.

“There are a lot of people who
worry about grade inflation,” Koloc
said. “I don’t think faculty would hes-
itate to give a student an A+ if they
thought [students] would [only] get a
couple of extra points.”

Koloc acknowledged that “in the-
ory, you could have someone graduat-
ing above the maximum amount [of
quality points on a 4.0 scale].” He
noted that one of his fraternity broth-
ers at Brown University graduated
with a QPA of 4.25.

But cases like these are unlikely
to be common at Pitt. Last term,
1,820 of the 52,658 grades (3.46 per-
cent) awarded in CAS were A+
grades.

The relative scarcity of A+ grades
was reﬂected in many students’ reac-
tion to the proposal. While students
universally expressed support for the
idea, many added comments like,
“not that this applies to me.”

Also, A+ grades “tend to cluster,”
Koloc said.

“I see some transcripts with a
dozen of them,” he said. “Some stu-
dents never get one.”

Koloc also said implementation
of the proposal would probably pose
few practical problems with grade
calculation.

“There’s nothing to say that the
computers [which calculate grades]
can’t be programmed to do that,” he
said.

For those reasons —— the relative
scarcity of A+ grades and the lack of
logistical problems with implement-
ing the proposal —— Koloc said that
now is an opportune time to raise the
issue for another round of considera-
tion.

Scaife Family
gives money for
Parkinson’s
research

Pitt’s Center for Excellence in
Parkinson’s disease received a
$400,000 research grant.

The grant, awarded by the
Scaife Family Foundation, will
provide funding for the develop-
ment of research proposals and
the purchaseof new equipment
for 1998 and 1999. The University
has already received the first
year’s worth of money.

Michael Zigmond of Pitt’s
Department of Neurobiology said
the funds will make ‘possible the
start of several new projects in the
coming months.

“Most of them will be directed
by individuals who have not pre-
viously applied their skills for the
study of Parkinson’s disease,”
said Zigmond. “We are confident
that important new insights will
come from this work and deeply
appreciate the support.”

Vandals strike
Forbes Field
landmark

To the vandals who defaced a
brick wall in Oakland last week, it
was “probably just an open wall
and a place to leave their mark,”
said Stephen Haluszczak of the
Pittsburgh Council for
International Visitors.

But to Pittsburgh sports fans,
these simple bricks and mortar
enshrine one of the city’s leg-
endary moments.

The Pittsburgh Pirates won
their first World Series in 35 years
when Bill Mazeroski hit a homer
over the wall in the ninth inning
of the last game of 1960. Like the
Immaculate Reception twelve
years later, unlikely numbers of
Pittsburghers have claimed to
have witnessed the game in per-
son.

When Forbes Field was torn
down in 1971, the historic portion
of the wall was preserved. The
city has owned it since then, and
had the responsibility of removing
the graffiti scrawled on the bricks
last week. 1‘

Police arrest
robbery suspect

Police arrested a man suspected
of at least one other robbery after
he attempted a holdup in an
Oakland bank last Wednesday.

David S. Jordan, 37, walked
into the Eureka Federal Savings
and Loan at about 3:25 p.m. and
handed a teller a note that read,
“Give me the money. Big bills, or
I’ll kill,” according to police.

As Jordan left the bank, a red
dye packet the teller had hidden in
the money bag exploded. Police
were able to corner him in an alley
near Chesterfield Street.

Jordan fit the description of the
perpetrator of a robbery that took
place a week earlier at the Gateway
Center post office downtown.

Memorial service
to beheld for Pitt
professor

A memorial service will be held
for Dr. Jack D. Myers on Sunday at
2 p.m. in Heinz Chapel. Myers was
the chairperson of Pitt’s Department
of Medicine from 1950 to 1970.

Myers received his medical
degree from Stanford in 1937, and
spent the next 60 years working in
fields from internal medicine to arti-
ficial intelligence. Colleagues and
former students remember Myers as
an exceptionally knowledgeable
physician, a tough and effective
educator, and a dedicated
researcher.

‘ After completing his postgradu-
ate training at Stanford and Peter
Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston,
Myers volunteered as a captain in
the U.S. Army medical reserve. He
served in Northern Ireland and
England until 1946.

Myers earned many awards
throughout his career, including the
1971 Pittsburgh Academy of
Medicine Man of the Year Award
and the 1981 Distinguished
Teaching Award from the College of
American Physicians.

He was elected to the National
Academy of Sciences Institute of
Medicine in 1976, served on adviso-
ry councils for the National
Institutes of Health, and was presi-
dent of the American College of
Physicians from 1976 to 1977.

Myers died of cardiac arrest
January 31, 1998. He is survived by
his wife of 51 years, Dr. Jessica
Lewis, a son, three daughters and
nine grandchildren.

are no definitive plans for
installing lights. While lights are
an option, Cravotta pointed out
that most city parks and trails
close at dusk.

The city obtained the land for
the new bikeway through an ongo-
ing county—wide initiate through
which it purchases old rail lines

~and converts them to exercise

paths. The project, dubbed “Rails—
to—Trails,” is a common type of
project occurring across the nation
as local governments ponder what
to do with abandoned railroad
tracks.

Pitt students’ reactions to the
the new trail have generally been
positive, although a few students
have grumbled that the city has
other problems on which it should
be spending money, such as solv-
ing traffic backups and repairing
streets.

However, most students see
the completed bikeway as a cheap
method to get downtown. For oth-

ers, it stands as a sign of the city’s %

interest in bettering the Oakland
community.
“Anytime you can combine

cise and great scenery, it has to be
a good thing,” said graduating
senior Tim Birdsong. ‘

THE Prrr NEws

AssAuL'r

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs will
investigate and Pitt will take judicial
measures against the people who may
have broken University drinking policy,
Service said. If Tri-Delta is found to have
broken Pitt’s rules, decertification is
something the school will consider,
according to Service.

“I do ﬁnd it outrageous that in this
day and age, a University—affiliated
sorority would conduct this type of func-
tion with free—ﬂowing liquor available to
those below legal age,” Butler said.

With anti—underage—drinking cam-
paigns becoming convention here and
across the country, Service said Pitt has
done all it can to avoid problems like this.

“There is no way the University is
in a position to monitor the activity of
every student off campus,” he said.

Service could not say whether the
investigation will be effected by the
paty’s location, miles from campus.

John Leventis, owner of Loafers,
said he’s not responsible, either — not
only because a Tri-Delta member assured
him that no underage guests would be at
the party, but also because bouncers
check the age of every person who enters
his bar.

“We did check IDs, but sometimes
they [underage drinkers] lie” to police
about having fake identiﬁcation because
it can lead to driver’s license suspension
and a ﬁne, Leventis said.

worried about the suspect than the under-
age drinking.

Tri-Delta President Katie Carney
had little to say about the letter because
she didn’t know about it.

“We have, obviously, guidelines
and bylaws we have to follow,” she said
of her group’s underage—drinking policy.
She refused to comment further.

Tri-Delta wasn’t allowed to throw
any parties that day, according to Pitt’s
Panhellenic Association President
Melissa Chordock. _

“I don’t think it’s a national

Panhellenic rule, but I said a week before
Finals, they were not allowed to have any
events,” she said. The rule meant no Pitt
sororities were permitted to have parties
from April 13 to April 25, when the week
of ﬁnal exams ended.

“Obviously this , is disgusting.
There’s a lot of irresponsibility,” she said.

At the May 15 preliminary hearing,
Butler concluded the woman’s testimony
was sufﬁcient to hold the case for court.
The man is charged with sexual assault,
according to Ingram. A trial date was not

“There is a deﬁnite phase—down

plan,” he said. “Any restrictions placed
on space and equipment availability for
emeriti will be handled in a humane
way.”
Tabakin said allowing the retirees
to continue their research is a cost-
effective venture for the University
because portions of the government
grants the retirees receive serve to
cover the costs of’ their overhead
expenses. These expenses include utili-
ty costs such as electricity, gas and
water, and maintenance of facility
space.

Koehler contends it is wrong to
characterize Pitt’s support of these
researchers as a “money—making propo-
sition for the University.” According to
Koehler, funds generated pay “for the
expense that the University contributes
to let them do their research.”

Retired faculty will be free to enlist
undergraduate students to help with
their research and will aid graduate stu-
dents with their own work.

“Typically, the faculty members
have grants, and they have graduate stu-
dent support for GSRs (Graduate

Rebecca Clycamp, assistant chair-
woman of the chemistry department,
said one of the three retirees in the
chemistry department intends to remain
at Pitt to conduct research.

She said such faculty will be grant-
ed the use of space and equipment only

mer faculty to assist graduate students

Sexual Assault high price
to pay for sorority party

Recently, a Tri-Delta sorority sister woke up in
her date’s room on blood-stained sheets. She testiﬁed
before the Pittsburgh Magistrate’s Court that she had
at least four shots of hard liquor and most of two
pitchers of beer. She claimed she remembered refus-
ing to have sex with her “date” that night, but the rest
was a haze. I .

The Greek system is often criticized for being
irresponsible and careless, especially with regard to
sex and alcohol. With the recent alleged sexual
assault of a sorority member, which could have been
prevented, it’s easy to see why.

Tri-Delta had organized a private “Bring-A-
Date” party, with an open bar, at Loafers, a down-
town club. Though Loafers’ management should
have been suspicious that a University-certiﬁed
sorority would bring underage people into the bar,
jeopardizing their liquor license, they were assured
by Tri-Delta that all those in attendance would be of
legal age. '_

Though Loafers claimed IDs were checked (the
victim and the alleged assailant were 18 and 19,
respectively), Tri-Delta’s violation of protocol, com-
bined with the possibility of allegedly endorsing the
use of fake IDs, met with disastrous consequences.

Tri—Delta also broke a Panhellenic rule by hold-
ing the party during Finals week. By operating out-
side of the Greek fold, and breaking rules which
were designed to prevent this type of horriﬁc act
from happening, a heavy price was paid.

Tri-Delta’s efforts at sisterhood failed miserably.

.In a situation where mass amounts of alcohol were

consumed, and the theme of the night was of a sexu-
al nature (“Bring-A-Date” might as well have been
called “Bring-A—Sex-Partner”), they allowed her to
end up with her date —— drunk. If the sisters of Tri-
Delta had looked out for one another, as they claim
to do during their Rush weeks, then this alleged sex-
ual assault would not have occurred.

The University can’t possibly control students’
propensity to consumealcohol, or control where they
drink it. It therefore lies with the Greek system —-—
including sororities who operate outside Panhellenic

rules — itself to look out for their own members, and .

ensure that they act in a responsible manner.

This recklessness exacted a terrible price on the
woman, a tragic event that will remain with her long
after her graduation. God help her now that she’s
paying the highest price.

Liberal theology and
actions hypocritical

Liberals and members of the
Democratic party profess to be the true
representation of fairness, equality and tol-
erance. In reality, such courtesies are only
extended to those who follow their ideolo-
gy. A few recent supporting anecdotes:

The ﬁrst involves campaign ﬁnance.
Democrats attempt to beat the GOP over
the head for not passing additional cam-
paign ﬁnance laws. At the same time,
high-ranking Democrats have willingly
admitted to violating laws already in exis-
tence.

When ﬁrst questioned about his in-
ofﬁce telephone solicitations, Al Gore
denied everything and stated that he never
made any telephone calls for the
Democratic National Committee from his
federal oﬁice. Later, Gore admitted that he
made “a few” phone calls from his oﬂice.
A few days later, after the phone logs and
DNC calling sheets were made public,
Gore admitted to making over 75 calls

stalled and blocked efforts to discover who
gave the order to garner these ﬁles. It is
illegal to remove these ﬁles and hold them
outside FBI headquarters. Any investiga-
tion or outside media pressure? Another
example of Democrat hypocrisy.
Conservative Supreme Court Justice
nominee Clarence Thomas was intensely
questioned and scrutinized on national
television for allegedly making a joke
about “I_.ong Dong Silver” and a pubic
hair on a Coke can years prior. Feminist
organizations were in an uproar.
Republican Bob Packwood was thrown
out of the Senate for allegedly hitting on
his female staffers. Feminist organizations
were in an uproar. Any case of sexual
harassment in the military (a conservative-
supported institution), from Tailhook to
Sergeant Major McKinney, received the
attention, victim support and outrage of
feminist organizations. They called for the
withdrawal, resignation or ﬁring of all of

from his federal office and in . the above.

doing so, raised nearly $1 mil- PA U |_ But when the liberal

lion for the DNC. C LA R K Democrat President Clinton
There already exists a allegedly exposed himself to a

campaign ﬁnance law that COLUMNIST female employee and demand

prohibits anyone from solicit- .
ing political donations in their federal
ofﬁce. Democratic Party hacks label this
law as ancient and archaic, as it does not
take into account deals made over a tele-
phone. »

Question: Upon listening to the Vice-
President of the United States asking you
for a donation and being well aware that
this man has quick-dial phone numbers for
the IRS, CIA, FBI, ATF, EPA and other
organizations that could wreak havoc and
possibly destroy your business, family and
livelihood, would you feel a little intimi-
dated?

Gore also admitted to illegal cam-
paign fundraising in the Paciﬁc Rim and
returned all donations (that we know of).
Of course this was aﬁfer the monies had
already been used in the 1996 election.

Gore broke laws already in existence
and the Department of Justice refused to
even investigate. Why pass new laws
when the Democrats will ignore and break
them without reprise, as they have already
done for years?

Yet it’s the Republicans’ fault for not

In the Clinton White House, over 900

If you want to sexually harass some-
one, all you have to do is be a Democrat or
a liberal. If you’re conservative, life as you
know it has ceased. The hypocrisy
abounds in other arenas as well.

Ifyou wish to advocate against the use
of alcohol, drugs and premarital sex (of
any kind), make damn sure that you shave
your head, dress like a punk, and join the
“Straight Edge” group. You will then be
revered by the media (i.e. 60 Minutes and
The Pitt News) as a good example. If you
dress in a plain fashion (i.e. jeans and a
Polo—shirt), are a Republican and strictly
advocate the same thing — LOOK OUT!
You will be labelled by liberals as “back-
wards,” “homophobic,” “extremis ’ and
“fascist” (i.e. me).

Hypocrisy thrives throughout liberal
and Democratic ideology and action. Their
analysis and conclusion on any given situ-
ation depends upon what feels good and
the personal politics of the persons
involved In their eyes, your opinion or
your defense is legitimate only if you ful-
ﬁll their prerequisites, regardless of your
evidence, character or experiences.

WEDNESDAY, 20 MAY 1998

John

Van Nijmwegen

There are intellectuals out there
who deride basic cable as the opiate
from which the masses get an electron-
ic high. But little do these ivory tower
philosopher—wannabes know that on
one small Fox subsidiary ~— the under-
rated and overtly ‘80s nostalgia charmel
F/X — there lies a program which,
though blatant in its testosterone—fueled
content and appearance, contains social-
ist philosophy that has gone unnoticed
and over the heads of America’s couch-
assed telejunkies.

If Friedrich Engels were alive
today, he too would watch “The A-
Team.” As a boy in Noordwijk,
Netherlands, I enjoyed playing with my
“A-Team” action ﬁgures. (Though I did
not know it at the time, and it’s a col-
umn unto itself, I believe that “Masters
of the Universe” is blatant neoconserva-
tive propaganda, hence my decision not
to be all teary—eyed about that cartoon.)
Upon arriving in Pittsburgh, my dismay
in not ﬁnding any hard-core pomogra—
phy stations on cable was soon replaced
with delight when I saw those four rnid—
dle-aged rebels, just the way I remem-

. bered them, battling corporate scum,

drug dealers and the Military Police.
“The A—Team” does, however,
allude to America’s obsession with the
Stars ‘n Stripes. In an attempt to get the
“Dukes of Hazzard” and “Fall Guy”
fans to watch, and to make those liber-

_ als understand them, they’re on the run

   

TH: Prrr News

Karl Marx: ''I pity the feel!"

from the Military Police for a crime
they didn’t commit. Republicans would
dislike the A—Team if its members were

doing what they did for the greater

cause of the working classes. Slap
together a script with “Hail Jesus and
fuck you,” and “Bless America, land of
the free (as long as you’re not a spic,
Jew, nigger or fag),” and one has the
reactionary Republicans hooked.

The A—Team, comprised of
Hannibal Smith (George Peppard),
Templeton “Face” Peck (Dirk
Benedict), H.M. “Howling Mad”
Murdock (Dwight Schultz) and B.A.
Baracus (Mr.T), is essentially a merce-
nary unit for hire, but in some cases,
they work even though there appears to
be no ﬁscal reward. They seem to cover
their costs —— stupendous amounts of
ammunition, ﬂipped vehicles,
Murdock’s psychiatric treatment, Face’s
Corvette, Hannibal’s Cuban cigars and
Mr.T’s gold trinkets — by looting and
pillaging from their Villains.

Looking at individuals within the
group, we can make comparisons with
real—life leftists. Hannibal comes off as
a white Laurent Kabila rip—off — portly,
with an afﬁnity for cigars, and a dogged
determination and belief that if one
sticks to one’s cause, in the long run,
one will prevail against all odds (and
Mobutu Sese Seko, or whichever comes
first). I could well imagine Kabila,
emerging triumphant in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo last year, riding
through the capital city of Kinshasa on a
tank, saying to his comrades, “I love it

when a plan comes together.”

Face, a middle-aged man at the time
the “A-Team?’ was ﬁlmed, reminds me
of a young Ernesto “Che” Guevara.
Face is a swashbuckler, a cad, a wom-
anizer. Read Guevara’s “Motorcycle
Diaries” (his autobiographical account
of his trip on a motorcycle through
Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and
Venezuela at age 23), then watch Face
in action scamming goods, and the sim-
ilarities are more than obvious.

Murdock can be compared with the .

ever—zany and eccentric J .P. Marat, or
even his looney compadre the Marquis
de Sade. Mr.T reminds me, in a weird
kind of way, of the portly and attitude-
bearing Karl Marx. One can easily
come up with Mr.T/Marx blended
phrases, such as:

° “Up the workers, sucker!”

- “Shut up, bourgeois fool!”

0 “I pity the fool who oppresses the pro-
letariat!”

Even . the reactionary Colonel
Decker (Lance LeGault) turns up as a
metaphor for the embodiment of all that
is reactionary in this world. UNITA’s
Jonas Savimbi, a reactionary mercenary
who tried to overthrow the
Marxist/Nationalist Angolan
Government in the ‘70s and ‘80s, seems
like the leader upon whom Col. Decker
is based. “The soldier who can capture
an MPLA member or one of their
Cuban allies gets to keep his rank,”
must surely be one of Savimbi’s catch
phrases.

Asfor the plot lines, they speak for

themselves. Here’s four plot lines which
show that the show had socialist, not
liberal, leanings:

- The A—Team helped unionize farm
workers in California against exploita-
tive farmers.

- The A-Team helped rid a Nicaraguan
village of right-wing guerillas.

- The A—Team battled CIA—backed
Colombian gunrunners.

0 The A—Team drove a bus full of three-
months pregnant women through a rnil—
itary blockade to an abortion clinic.
(Okay, I made that one up?) i

Even though a new episode of “The
A—Team” has not been made in over 12
years, it is still an important facet of
American culture, for both the televi-
sion tubby and the couch—bound revolu-
tionary.

And as I sum up a mysterious col-
umn, which I can justify only by the
recent wave of ‘80’s nostalgia sinking
its sharp talons into my ﬂesh, I will
compare an ending —— Murdock’s death
in the last episode was mysterious (did
he or did he not die in an explosion on
that boat?), and so was Che Guevara’s
(it took 30 years to find his body in
Vallegrande, Bolivia).

Stephen J. Cannell did not save the
world, but he did know how to make
entertaining —— and politically enlight-
ening —— television.

John Van Nijmwegen, being Dutch,
loves Grolsch and Heineken, but doesn ’t
mind the occasional 40—ounce bottle of
St. Ides malt liquor.

A hilarious and scary Irip in Vegas

By HENRY]. MASON

”It started when I left Vegas that
first time, skipping the hotel bill, dri-
ving off in the red convertible all
alone, drunk and crazy, back to LA.
That's exactly what I felt. Fear and
loathing.”

So said Hunter S. Thompson
recently about his critically acclaimed
and rather deranged 1971 novel,
”Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,”
which chronicled in hallucinogenic
detail the journey of a journalist and
his lawyer into Las Vegas, ostensibly
to cover a dirt-bike race for a sports
magazine. But with the help of a suit-
case full of assorted pharmaceuticals,
they succeed in turning the assign-
ment into an extended drug trip,
making little other than a strange and
misguided attempt at ﬁnding the
American dream.

Fans of the book will be extreme-
ly happy with the new movie of the
same name. From the main charac-
ter’s narration, lifted almost directly

 

WEDNESDAY,

from the novel, to some lines, for
example, ”As your lawyer, I advise
you to take a hit out of the little
brown bottle in my shaving bag,” the
film is the best possible interpretation
of the novel. The characters and set-
tings appear as they did in 1971.
Johnny Depp, as Raoul Duke, Hunter
S. Thompson's alter ego, looks like a
younger replica of Thompson, with a
bald head, prominent ears and a per-
manently affixed cigarette holder.
Benicio del Toro gained 40 pounds
for his role as Dr. Gonzo, Duke's cor-
pulent Samoan attorney. And Las
Vegas itself is a composite of old
buildings and computer-generated
replicas of glittering fixtures long
replaced by modern buildings.
Director Terry Gilliam (Brazil)
impressively recreates what is essen-
tially an aimless journey through a
psychedelic haze. At times, the movie
is ridiculously funny, like when
Raoul Duke wakes up in a trashed
hotel suite wearing a tail and a lot of
electrical tape. Sometimes the narra-

remain buried under layers of coke,
LSD and mescaline, stumbling
around in a frightened stupor. The
narration holds the story together -
after all, how interesting is a person
whose nervous system has

it's inside the scattered

slavering dinosaurs, or ponder-

Thompson's fantastic prose. It

when the two anti-heroes

Incumbent California
Senator Bulworth sits deep in
kickbacks and bribes. His wife
appears only for photo oppor-
tunities. And his campaign is
forgotten beneath pointless
rhetoric.

After anxious days with-
out food or sleep, he signs on
for an immense amount of life
insurance to beneﬁt his daugh-
ter and contracts a hit on his
own life to be carried out over
the last weekend of his cam-
pargn.

Oh yeah, Bulworth is a com-
edy. The unorthodox Warren
Beatty (Reds, Shampoo) directs
the movie with a strong sense
of hilarity in juxtaposition.

Since he is planning to die,
he starts speaking his mind --
blunt honesty. His first stop is
Compton, where he mocks
racial stereo . He moves
on to Beverly Hills, insulting
Jewish constituents. Then, he

spends an entire night drink-
ing, smoldng pot and dancing
with Nina -- one of his insult-
ed voters nearly 30 years his
junior, played by Halle Berry.

Reinvigorated by some
truth-telling and partying, he
spends the rest of the weekend
trying to call off the hit.

The stiff, 60-ish, white
politician changes a little bit
while hanging out with the
young, street~wise, African-
American Nina. On TV for a
debate, he raps to his oppo-
nent, admits he has taken
bribes and shows disgust with
the system. The media and the
public are attracted to his
sooth-saying rhythm, giving
new life to his campaign.

Beatty wisely puts himself
up for ridicule when he dress-
es in a teenager's clothes,
baggy shorts and all. He's an
odd picture in the changing
times. But he successfully pass-
es along ugly truths of the old
and current times in scathing
satire.

By ZACHARIAH BLOTT

Green Day, the quintessential ’90’s pop-punk
band from California, headlines a line-up that
includes ska-core gods the Mighty Mighty
Bosstones and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott
Weiland in a solo performance. They're all coming
to Star Lake Amphitheatre this Monday.

It's X-Fest, a local music festival witha handful
of big-narne acts that guarantees a diverse high-
energy show.

Green Day's new album, Nimrod, the follow—up
to Insomniac and Dookie, was recorded in Los
Angeles last summer. It features the top-ﬁve hits
”Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)” and
”I-Iitchin’ a Ride.” The album has already sold over
one million copies worldwide and garnered plat-
inum and gold awards in many countries. The
band easily alternates more soulful tunes with the
punk of their past. -

In addition, the band's 1994 album Dookiewas
cited by England's Q magazine (January 1998) as
one of the "essential dozen” all—time punk albums.
With a plethora of hits, Green Day may be the high-
light of the show, but they're in good company.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones are the Barnum
& Bailey of contemporary popular music, with
upbeat ska tunes, bright suits and a member who
does nothing but silly dances on stage. After 10

years of building
the largest under-
ground following in
America, they
broke into the main-
stream a few years
ago. But they still
have a crazy energy
that makes them a
blast to watch live.
And Scott
Weiland released a
solo album, 12—Bar
Blues, earlier this
year that's been
described as ”mad
pop” and ”art
noise,” earning it
mixed reviews.
Although he's
unproven as a solo
artist, his days with
STP earned him the
beneﬁt of the doubt.
Also playing at X-
Fest are the industrial/ alternative band Stabbing
Westward, reminiscent of the audacious Tool, and
the high-octane quartet Fuel, never light on the
power-chords. ]immy’s Chicken Shack made it big
two years ago with the MTV release of their pow-

By JAKE WOMER

Robert Cray understands the
inspirational power of atmos-
phere.

He took his band to Memphis,
Tenn., to record an album, result-
ing in 1997's Sweet Potato Pie. Cray
recruited the legendary Memphis
Horns and melded a seasoned
rhythm-and-blues sound with
reflective soul.

Cray found classic tunes in the
early ’70’s blues scene, but he's
been near the top of contemporary

  SOUNDTRACK

 

Treat” from Sweet Potato Pie. If he
gets the house rocking, Cray will
reach back into a bag of tricks that
includes Grammy-winning guitar
playing. Sure, he plays the guitar
on Pie, but his songs are unadul-

' terated blues with his fast hands in

songs like ”Smoking Gun” on the
1986 double platinum Strong
Persuader. .

Highly respected among his

peers and mentors, Cray has
played with a number of the greats
— John Lee Hooker, B. B. King,
Tina Turner and The Rolling
Stones. He has performed in trib-
utes to Chuck Berry and Stevie
Ray Vaughan. Eric Clapton
even covered Cray’s ”Bad
Inﬂuence” in 1987.
With rhythmic grooves like
”1040 Blues” and ”I Shiver” on
the 1993 album Shame 63* a Sin,
and the title track on 1992's "I
Was Warned,” Cray gives the
audience a vast array of the
blues done his way, the right way.
And the seats are even cheaper

NC sells out
with athletes

In the world of college athletics,
boosters aren’t the preventative shots
that children receive prior to age two,
but rather, the ﬁlthy—rich supporters
of sports.

Every major college program is
littered with these types; the ones
willing to “loan” a car to a student
athlete, “help ﬁnance” a ﬂight home
or “introduce” a player to a profes-
sional agent—friend of his.

Boosters are a sort of enigma to a
university: they share the strange dis-
tinction of helping college athletic
departments with necessary ﬁnancial
support while also potentially hurting
programs by giving athletes illegal
money.

Most programs keep a watchful
eye on these boosters, and many
smart programs do their best to elimi-
nate direct contact between boosters
and athletes.

But the NCAA, in its inﬁnite wis-
dom, has recently ruled that boosters
can now pay college athletes. And the
ruling may hurt.

The new rule is known as Prop.
62, and beginning August 1, athletes
can earn as much as $2,000 during a
school year by working jobs provided
through the athletic department,
coaches or other “athletic interests.” _

This may seem like a good idea.
After all, why shouldn’t an athlete
who makes thousands of dollars for a
university be compensated?

The problem arises in the phras-
ing of the new Prop. 62. The “athletic
interests” that the rule talks about are
far from the kind-hearted alumni who
give an athlete a few bucks for shov-
eling the snow from their driveway.

The “athletic interests” are actu-
ally the slimy boosters that proliferate
major college athletics.

Stipends from universities are
already given to college athletes.
They are used to make up for the fact
that athletes are too busy to make
extra money working a part—time job.
Stipends range in amount from one
school to the next by providing ath-
letes with ample money for clothes,
books and food.

Athletes do deserve money con-
sidering the amount of time they
devote to their university. A typical
in—season day for a Pitt basketball
player, for example, begins before
6:00 a.m. and ends at 11:00 p.m., with
practice, games and studying in-
between.

Crew rows
well at Dad
Vail Regatta

Joe Carmody
For The Pltt News

For the Pittsburgh Crew Team, this
past season was one to be proud of, to
learn from and to build on toward its
promising future. The team completed its
season on the rainy day of May 10 in
Philadelphia at the Dad Vail Regatta race.

In the world of crew fans, competi-
tors and coaches, this is the Super Bowl
of races with about 100 schools partici-
pating and 75,000 in attendance.

Pitt's best ﬁnish came from the men's
novice four—man—boat which came in
ﬁfth out of 18. The team was Matt
Rogers, Nate Mitterling, Ben Althof and
Eric Green; Leslie ' Cucuzza was the
Coxswain.

Men's novice coach Matt Bunce
said, "I was proud of the way my team
ﬁnished this season. I had the best novice
class ever to work with."

The men's light weight eight also fm-
ished ﬁfth. This is the best this group has
ever ﬁnished at Pitt.

Coach Bunce wants his players to
remain in shape and run a great deal over

  

aoiiagioiond AOW3 xaumvd Nvag

 

the summer in order to better their per-
formances for next season.

Recapping this past season Bunce
said, "I want to congratulate captains
Matt Rogers and Scott Vifisniewski for
their great effort all year."

Awards were given to MVP, Eric
Green who also received the novice lead-
ership award for the solid example he
displayed. Ben Althof received the
"Hammer Award," which goes to the
man with the lowest times. Also, fresh-
man Ned Longdon was honored for win-
ning the novice lightweight 2000-meter
race.

At the Mid-Atlantic College
Championships the novice lightweight
eight ﬁnished second. The varsity light-
weight four boats finished first and sec-

The crew team finished its season with its best finish at the Dad Vail Regatta.

ond with only a one second difference.
The varsity women's four ﬁnished third,
as did the novice women's four.

These results come at another tough
race for Pitt. Many schools from all over
the East competed in this race.

Head Coach Todd Ridenour said, ''It
was a successful season, more so than
last year." Ridenour believes that his
team was consistent throughout the year
because of how well they prepared.

The increase in both number and
stature of the crew members has allowed
the coaching staff to work with and train
its members at a highly competitive
level. With possibly 12 returning letter-
men and a quality transfer from La Salle,
John Wall, the future for our Pitt Crew
Team is one to keep your eyes on.

WHO SAID OFF-SEASON?

Cummings heas F
for a tryout with Team USA

column, page 14

al team later this month in Colorado.

Cummings hopes to make the  nation-

It may be the basketball off—sea—
son in the sense that there aren't any
games until November.

For Pitt guard Vonteego
Cummings, though, the competition
he'll face next week is beyond any-
thing he's seen so far in college, and
it's not because he's leaving Pitt for the
NBA.

Cummings will be one of 33 col-
lege hoopsters competing for a spot on
the 12-member USA Basketball Men's
National Team.

"This is a well—deserved honor for
Vonteego," said Pitt Head Coach
Ralph Willard. "He is one of the pre-
mier players in the country headed
into this season."

The trials will be held May 29-31

Colorado

at the United States Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
This low air—pressure location may
prove helpful for Cummings, who set
a Big East durability record last sea-
son by averaging 40.1 minutes per
game.

Last year, Cummings earned All-
Big East honors for the second season
in a row. He ranked third in the con-
ference in scoring (19.5 points) and
second in both assists (6.1) and steals
(2.2 ) per game.

Among the players selected for
the try-outs are Big East Player of the
Year Richard Hamilton from the
University of Connecticut, Big East
Freshman of the Year Khalid El—Amin
from the University of Connecticut

Pirates suftero drop in wins from last year as youth dominates

Ned Schano

Senior Staff Wrlter

Last season, the Pittsburgh Pirates
were the most surprising team in base-
ball. Devoid of more than a handful of
legitimate major leaguers, most experts
predicted that the Pirates would be the
worst team in 1997, if not one of the
worst this decade.

The Bucs went on to have their
most exciting season since they won
three straight division titles from 1990
to 1992. Although they ended the sea-
son under .500, they challenged the
Houston Astros for the division lead
and earned the moniker
Comeback Kids” for their penchant for
come—from—behind victories.

But this is 1998.

The Pirates have played far less
inspiring baseball since their unlikely
season last year. Theyhave been under
.500 for the majority of the season and
after more than a quarter of the season,
their record stands at 20-24. V

Although the team has had difficul-
ty replicating the energy and grit of
1997, this year’s team is once again
one of the youngest in baseball. Left
fielder Al Martin is the Bucs‘ oldest
starter, and he's only 30 years old.

While the Pirates are young, even
younger talent awaits in the minor
leagues. The team was voted the best

minor league system in baseball by

“The ‘

Baseball America last season, and
minor league all-stars such as third
baseman Aramis Ramirez, first base-
man Ron Wright, second baseman/out-
ﬁelder Chad Hermansen and pitcher
Chris Benson are waiting for their call-
up.

In the meantime, the Pirates must
rely on scraping together wins. And the
foundation of any good team, as the
Atlanta Braves and Astros will tell you,
is starting pitching. The Pirates‘ starting
pitching has been inconsistent, but their
staff is among the youngest in the
major leagues.

The cornerstone of the rotation is
26-year old Francisco Cordova.
Cordova, whom the Pirates plucked
away from the Mexican Leagues, has
just a 4-3 record but has had poor run
support. Cordova has been dominant at
times and his 2.37 ERA leads the staff.

Jason Schmidt has been the sur-
prise of the group. Schmidt, who is the
Pirates‘ hardest thrower next to closer
Rich Loiselle, has learned to throw
more strikes this season and is among
the league leaders with a 6-1 record.

Jon Lieber is the elder statesman of
the group at 28 years old, but as any
high school freshman will tell you, just
because he’s the oldest doesn’t mean
he’s the best. Lieber has a pitiful 1-6
record this year, and while he leads the
teamlwith 46 strikeouts, the 10 home
runs he has surrendered in his nine

starts have hurt him.

The Pirates‘ other two starters, Jose
Silva and Esteban Loaiza, have been
mediocre at best. Silva, in his first sea-
son as a major league starter, is 4-3
with a 4.30 ERA. Loaiza is rumored to
be on the trading blocks and may be
dealt to the Detroit Tigers for third
baseman Joe Randa. But his 2-2 record
and 5.40 ERA should scare away most
teams.

Manager Gene Lamont has been
patient with his starters, but only
Cordova and Schmidt have consistent-
ly shown that they can pitch into the
seventh inning. Consequently, the
bullpen has seen plenty of action.

Closer Rich Loiselle has lost three A

games but he seems to have settled
down in the last two weeks. Loiselle’s
nine saves are still among the league
leaders. His primary set—up men,
Ricardo Rincon, Jason Christiansen
and Chris Peters, have been outstand-
ing, all with ERA’s under 2.00.
Offensively, the Pirates boast three
hitters who are among the league lead-
ers. Second—year right fielder Jose
Guillen has been one of‘ the major’s
hottest hitters during the month of May
and after a mediocre start, he is now
hitting .350. The 22-year-old Guillen
had been more known for his incredi-
ble, if not somewhat erratic, throwing
arm but has worked with hitting coach
Lloyd McClendon to eliminate the

overzealousness he had during his
rookie year at the plate. 1

Catcher Jason Kendall, who is hit-
ting .342, has continued to improve in
his third season as the Pirates‘ back-
stop. Kendall’s high batting average
goes along with his four home runs and
25 RBIs, which is second on the team
to first baseman Kevin Young.

Center fielder Jermaine
Allensworth has been the biggest sur-
prise of the season. Allensworth almost
lost his job at the end of last year, but
has rebounded to hit .328 in 40 games.
Allensworth, who seemed to be a for-
gotten man during spring training, has
shown he can handle the everyday cen-
ter field duties.

The area that the team is most lack-
ing in is power. Young has 10 home
runs, but as a team, the Pirates have hit
just 30 dingers. General Manager Cam
Bonifay is reportedly shopping for
another power hitter and is rumored to
be interested in Cardinals outfielder
Ron Gant. A

The shortstop. position was a sore
spot early in the year, with both Lou
Collier and Kevin Polcovich struggling
in the field and at the plate. A hitting
tear has propelled Collier into the start-
ing position, but his shaky defense may
eventually give way to Polcovich.

Bucs

from last season, left ﬁelder Al Martin
and second baseman Tony Womack,
have struggled. Martin has been
bounced around in the batting order
and is hitting just .239 with five
homers. Martin is the Pirates best pure
hitter and should rebound by the All-
Star break.

Womack is also struggling at .240.
Although he has 16 stolen bases, he
has struck out twice as often as he has
walked, not a good sign for a lead-off
hitter. _

Throughout the first quarter of the

FROM PAGE 13

season, the Pirates have been unable to _

string together more than a four or five
game stretch of solid baseball. That is
to be expected with such a young team.

The Pirates‘ youth and their scant
$13 million payroll, less than one-ﬁfth

‘of the Orioles league leading $68 mil-

lion, may prevent the Bucs from chal-
lenging in the National League
Central. But if they are able to string
together a few winning streaks, the
Pirates may be able to once again sur-
prise people.

BREAKING
NEWS

Panther men ’s
basketball assistant
Vince Taylor has
left Pitt to become
an assistant at
Wyoming. No
replacement has
been named. Look
for the story by
Zachariah Blott in
next week’s Pitt
News.

 FROM PAGE 12

Athletes also deserve money

because of the prestige and publicity’

they bring to a university, particularly
to a winning program. It’s a fact that
schools with winning athletic teams
create more money for a university
through increased merchandise and
ticket sales. Plus, winning university
teams generate more interest in that
university by translating into more
overall applicants and a better pool of
incoming freshmen each year.

It’s unrealistic to believe that ath-
letes have the time to devote to any full-
or part—time job while they are in sea-

son. But to allow boosters to create fake ’

jobs for athletes while paying them real
money is even more ridiculous than
believing that players go to the
University of Kentucky because of their

» ﬁne philosophy program.

Instead of making up fake jobs,
such as working at a boosters car deal-
erships or real—estate company, a better
form of payment would be to give a
regulated stipend to athletes while they
are in season. This stipend would be the
same for all athletes in every sport and
would be dependent on keeping a mini-
mum QPA, say a 2.0.

There are better alternatives to
rewarding athletes than giving them
dirty money. Allowing boosters to cor-
rupt college athletics is not the answer.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that
jobs are going to be fabricated, faked
and forged.

These extra “shots” the boosters
give to athletes may hurt college athlet-
ics worse than any chicken pox shot
ever could.

FRENCH INIPORTS

Watching opposing center Rafal
Bigus grab 18 rebounds against Pitt in
the Panthers’ ﬁnal game of the season
leading to a double—ove1time loss to
Villanova, was enough to convince any
fan that Pitt's frontcourt needed more
depth.

Coach Willard has already added 6-
foot—9 power forward Chris Seabrooks

from Thomson, Ga, Cummings’ home-
town.

Willard may now be hot on the trail
of French recruit Mohammed Kante.

Kante, a 6—foot—l0 center, is report-
edly an excellent shot—blocker and
rebounder. Other colleges looking at
Kante include UNLV, Villanova and
Virginia.

According to Willard, however, if
Kante decides to leave France to play
college basketball, he'll be a Panther.

"A lot of things will go into his deci-
sion (to come to America)," said Willard.
"I think he'll come here, though, if he
decides to travel overseas."

According to an article in last
Friday's Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,
Kante visited the University on Friday
and took some English tests.
