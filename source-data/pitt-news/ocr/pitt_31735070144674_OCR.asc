Senate talks tuition, salary freeze andbreast milk

by Alie Gensheimer
Staﬂ Writer

Speakers at Pitt’s Senate Council
meeting joined to discuss  milk
and the economy. —

Professor Paul Munro, chair of the
Plant Utilization and Planning Com-
mittee, proposed a resolution on breast
pumping, which “encourages all units

of the University to identify private

space, if needed, within  facili-
ties for mothers who wish to express
breast milk.” I

Another committee member said
that Pit1’s School of Nursing already
has two private nursing rooms

Someone then  from the
other end of the table that this is be-
cause it is, after all, the school of nurs-
ing ' ' .
Howls of laughter rose from
around the table, especially ﬁom Chan-
oellor Mark Nordenberg, who cackled
 personal microphone at the
joke ‘

Before the  turned to the -t

resolution, speakers confronted the
challenges that the University is 
in the current economic conditions
For the first time in public, Nor-
denberg addressed the lawsuit accusing
Westridge Capital Management Inc, of
 hundreds of millions of dol-
lars from Pitt and Carnegie Mellonf

“Our staff hasworkedveryhardto
--build ﬁnancial strength at Pitt,” he said.

“Although there are limits to what we

know right now, we hope to recover"

some of our assets and do not expect

that it will have a- short—term impact on

Pitt” '
Nordenberg also said that as the

‘economic turmoil continues, serious

budget  remain. He said that
the Planning and Budgeting Commit-
teeplans fortheupcomingﬁscalyear,
with the hope that Gov Ed Rendell’s
federal stimulus will prevent Pitt’s, bud-
get from  cut; ~

_ He expressed that even though»
Rendell does not plan to include Pitt in

the "proposed tuition relief act, “Con-
 tuition increase has always been

_ahighpn'ority, and atthis time,willbe—
. come an even higher priority”

President of the Senatejohnj. Bak-
er agreed that economic times are difﬁ—
cult He said that although the 6 percent
cut would “eventually be restored,” the
faculty and .staff’s salaries will still freeze
next year and the Govemofs School
 cut These effects, he said,
“hurt Pitt and hurt our students’ ’ _

In  of the economic situation“,
Baker said that Student Governrnent

\X/hile the economy presents the University
with several challenges, Nordenberg said that there
are rcasons for Pitt to remain positive

“One of the things that distinguishes Pitt from
other organizations is there is still a great demand
for the high—quality education and strong rcscarc ,”
said Nordenberg. ‘We therefore have incentive to
continue to provide topquality programs, despite
what’s going on in" the economy.’ ’

Nordenberg also said that Pitt is in a prime situ-
ation to receive stimulus  ﬁrom the govern-
ment '

“I don’t know that you could find an institution
that’s in a better position to attract those dollars,”
he said

He also said that research at Pitt already provides
23,000 local jobs, which indicates that “we have the
opportunity to play a big role in the economy’s irn—
provement,” he said.

Bill lets FDA regulate tobacco

at expense of free choice

Few people have any doubt that

I smoking is an unhealthy activity.

Experts have linked it to numerous
health risks, diseases and other sun-
dry conditions. But in an effort to
make the activity safer, the House
Energy and Commerce Comrnit-
tee overwhelmingly voted to give

_ the Food and Drug Administration.
_ the power to oversee and regulate

the tobacco industry.
The bill gives the FDA the pow-

: er to regulate ingredients, to require
I new labels on tobacco products
, and even to ban ﬂavored cigarettes

(with the exception of menthol),

. with the goal of the bill to “pre-

vent the dangerous and all—too
prevalent marketing and sales of

_ tobacco to kids,” according to Rep.

Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
Perhaps the most incredible

: thing about this bill is that it’s only
; being passed today. Cigarettes have
' been a known health risk for de-

cades, and yet their marketing, sale

j and consumption have gone more
A or less unregulated, with the excep-
tion of banning television ads and

requiring a warning from the sur-

. geon general on every package.

But the bill ‘goes further than

I that, requiring a new, larger label as

well as a full list of ingredients on

. each container of tobacco prod-

ucts,- and it would prohibit com-
panies from using words like “low-

V tar” and “light” in their marketing.

We have to wonder, though,

 how much this bill is actually aimed
at making cigarettes safer and how

much it is aimed at simply making

v them unattractive. larger warn-
‘  labels and ingredient lists are

welcome additions, but they don’t
actually do anything other than dis-
suade people from using the prod-

; uct.

Longtime smokers — and new
ones — aren’t going to beneﬁt

from reading a new label if . they still ‘

smoke afterward.

The bill would give the FDA

some ability to affect the cigarettes _

themselves: FDA‘ officials could
require the removal of harmful
chemicals from tobacco products,
and companies would have to pass

new products through an FDA ap— ‘
proval process. But for the most 

_part, it does nothing but make ciga-

rettes look less appealing and more
like a health risk.

The only reason this is fair at I

all is becauseﬂsmoking undeniably

poses a health risk. But requiring 
larger labels and banning strawber— i
ry—flavored cigarettes won’t have an t
effect on people already addicted I

to smoking, nor will it dissuade

people who know about the health 

risks and decide to smoke anyway.

In some ways, this bill is in— l
A _ by Erik Hinton
march toward government regula— ,
tion of private industry and the ‘

dicative of the United States’ slow

gradual rise of the nanny state,
Smoking is a health risk and, in
many cases, it’s a public health risk
But smoking is also a personal
choice.

Regulating the tobacco industry
ultimately has no goal other than to

dissuade people from smoking and .

to make tobacco a socially unac-
ceptable product. The only 
left for the government to do after

this is to ban tobacco products out— I

right, at which point citizens are ba-
sically being told that they can’tibe
trusted with their own well-being.

some good — tobacco products
are inarguably harmful, and regu-
lating them for the good of the
people who use them is a beneficial
goal. But we have to wonder where
this type of legislation will stop and
allow people to make their own
choices regarding their health.

The whole affair conjures the
image of an Archie Bunker—type
ﬁddling away on a drawing board,
chuckling over gawky dogs and
watching the “7OO Club.” When
hot—button issues spin through
the news, these comics try to wit-
tily incorporate in the most cut-
and-paste fashion imaginable. Is
Gov. Sarah Palin’s candidacy the
hot news of the day? White—out
“Spiro Agnew” from that ’70s
strip and write in “Palin” instead.
If similar dismal content was
allowed in other copy, all papers

a would have already died or gone

the way of the Christian Science
Monitor and been eaten up by the
Internet. Why, then, is “Marma-
duke” allowed to live? If Iiever
want to laugh even once on the
comics page, I have to pull a Pe-
ter Pan and muster all of my good
memories. It helps if a stranger
tickles me.

Webcornics have been light-
years ahead of print since the in-
ception of the Web. Sarcastic col-
legiates spend hours on sites such

Comics are papers’ only thread to their own histories

Hinton, page 6

as The Perry Bible Fellowship,
Dinosaur Comics and Wonder-
mark. I, on the other hand, have
never seen anyone lazing away the
afternoon with a “Cathy” collec-
tion. Whereas Webcomics con-
stantly innovate and follow trends
in modern dialogue, print comics
ﬂaccidly trail behind, doting on
chubby shoe—lovers and sloppy
hounds

More than contributing any-
thing stimulating to newspapers,

comics survive as some of the
last vestiges of the halcyon days
of newspapers. In the puerile, jin-
goistic innocence of the “Family
Circus,” we see an entire legacy of
news publication. Most of these
strips have not updated their im-
ages since Vietnam. Through
such consistency, older genera-
tions may seize upon the happy
thread of history.

' Furthermore, by‘ brazenly
turning a blind eye to modem is-

sues, fashions, styles of humor or
methods of illustration, comics
maintain the image that nothing
has changed in their often 50-
year—plus runs. Beetle Bailey still
ﬁghts in some ambiguous 20th-
century war. Andy Capp still wal-
lows in some drunken industrial-
age stupor. Frank and Ernest are
still optimistic homeless people
who can change shape at will.
Newly introduced print com-
ics are proof that we depend on

these very comics we disparage to
keep our papers feeling like pa-
pets’ as news organizations shift
ever further to the Internet. Sure,
“Zits” and “Non Sequitur” make
me laugh.

However, they make me feel
like I went home to ﬁnd an at-
tractive stranger lounging on my
couch. “Ma’am, I’m not entirely
upset. This just smacks of intru-
sion.”

Despite what good taste would

like to tell you, do not expect tra-
ditional print cornics to go away
anytime soon. _

At the very least, they are a
punching bag we can all rally
around and try out our new social
humors upon. But at the very best,
they are a cultural touchstone that
imprints history on ever—modern—
izing papers.

LETTERSTOTHEEDITOR  

To the Editor,

I am writing to comment on The Pitt News March 4 editorial, “Stim-
ulus grant a good gesture to make up for bad policy.” While I too am
relieved that Gov. Ed Rendell allocated $42 million in federal stimulus
funds to Pitt, the attack launched on the governor’s “too little, too late”

policies is misguided.

The villain here is not the Pennsylvania State Government, which is
facing many obstacles as a result of the economic downturn, but Pitt.
Though the University is certainly not malicious in its actions, when
it comes to budgetary concerns, the school does not -exactly exhibit

“common decency.”

As Liz Navratil’s front page update reports, “Pitt’s vice chancellor of
public affairs, Robert Hill, said it’s too early to tell how the funding will

affect the University.”

Instead of blaming the governor’s ofﬁce-for not having the ﬁnancial
resources to fund Pitt’s gluttonous budget, students should instead be
asking why the University doesn’t enact a tuition freeze on its behalf.
Despite the beating all Universityvendowments have taken in recent
months, Pitt’s would in no way be unduly burdened by such a decision.

The Univeristy could look to the humanistic ideals of the liberal
arts education it offers and attempt to meet students halfway at a time
when college loans, family ﬁnances and part-time jobs are drying up.
Unfortunately, it is much more likely, as Hill’s comments suggest, that
the Univeristy will gleefully accept stimulus funds with one hand while
using the other to slap Pitt students with another frivolous tuition hike

to replenish its endowment.

I’m writing ir1 response to Giles Howard’s piece, “Egalitarian care is not American.” First of all, I agree
with his title. This nation stole from natives and enslaved Africans — egalitarian care is by no stretch of
the imagination something our country should or can be noted as a representative of. —

That said, Howard’s argument is fallacious. He succeeds only in begging the question. The question
being asked is something like, “How much of the wealth that rich people own do they deserve?” How-
ard’s argument is simply the claim that taxing them more heavily than other groups is plundering their
wealth. Yet, the question at hand is if it is their wealth to begin with — you ca.n’t simply hold" that it is
in the face of that very question. So that was his logical mistake. It is enough for us to ignore what he’s
said because it is the functional equivalent of a child covering his ears and shouting as a response to his

Yet there is a further assumption Howard makes that is all too common and is never supported: that
people who are given an advantage will not then work hard to succeed. Who would play a game in which
the other players have an unfair advantage? By creating an atmosphere of egalitarianism in terms of op-
portunities and basic ‘needs, why shouldn’t we expect a larger pool of “the intelligent, the vigorous and
the exemplary” because the greater number who now have the opportunity to act upon their dreams? The
fact is, Howard gives us no reason to think his analogy is better -- just the same old hollow defenses of
a system that subjects individuals to a disparity of opportunities based on class.

The pure capitalism Howard defends merely represents an unconscious and unintentional caste sys-
tem. This economic caste system is why the sons and daughters of the rich tend to go on to be successful.
One might ask why they do not fail. After all, we would expect them to beneﬁt less from material suc-
cesses of their own than poor children. If arguments about the removal of incentives were at all sound,
we would expect this trend to be different than it is. That is why I am of the opinion that this line of
argument is anything but sound. Meanwhile the sons and daughters of the poor tend to go on_to be poor.
That a few select individuals move through the ranks doesn’t change the vast and overwhelming injustice

8 p.m., Saturday, March 7
Carnegie Music Hall of Homestead
East 10th Avenue, Munhall, PA
412-323-1919
or
vvww.ticketmaster.com

This weekend, Pittsburgh will be
hit with a deluge of diversity when
Americas most prominent female
queer Korean performer storms into
town, wielding her characteristic wit
alongside a ﬁeshly brandished 

On Saturday, comedian extraordi-
naireMargaretChowillpe1formatthe
Carnegie Music Hall of Homestead
\With her “Beautiﬁ.1l” tour now ﬁn-
ished, the showwill be made up mostly
of new, developing material.

However, in the spirit of Cho’s di-
verse identity and equally diverse career,
the show also features her burgeoning
foray into the realm of comedy music.

“I’Ve been doing music stuE for

about ﬁve years now,” said Cho “I
was mostly  to tracks and doing
stuff with rap music, but now Pm play-
ing guim

I’m actually pretty good It’s really
cool to pick up an instrument at 40 and
be pretty good at it.’ ’

The show will also feature Ian I-lar-
vie, a transgender comedian

‘‘He’s a -very funny, very smart
female—to—male comedian,” said Cho
“He’s incredible I’m really proud of
him”

Cho’s past shows featured very
strong themes, from her familial and
personal experiences of ‘Tm the One
that I \Want’ ’ to the more political mes-
sages of her more recent tours Re-
garding the theme of this show, Cho
says that the materialis still 

“It’s not experimental — well, the
comedy stuff is  but the
standup is all me,” said Cho ‘Tm still
putting together the theme of my next
show, so I’d say the material [for Satur-
days show] is developing.” I

Of course, Cho has more going on
than just her stand-up tours these days,
the most prominent and  of
which is her role in the new Lifetime
ensemble dnnn “Drop Dead 

Cho will be moving to Atlanta to
ﬁlm “Diva” and will simultaneously

work on her new comedy album, fea-
tuting the songs that she will play at
Saturdays show

A project that Cho might have to
put to the side is “The Cho Show,” her
VH1 reality show that follows her and
her  in the style of “Kathy Grif-
ﬁn: My Life on me D—List”.

However, Cho sees herself as a
unique personality in the blasted waste-
land of “follow-me—around” reality.

‘Tm pretty sure I’m the first person
to get anal bleaching on reality TV,”
joked Cho “I wanted the show to be
extremely outrageous — which I feel I
accomplished — but I also wanmd it to
be a sort of Asian-American sitcom
thatusedmyactualfamilyinsteaclof
actors meant to imitate them,” she
said.

As for the near future, Cho will
continue to tour, as well as perform in a
few  country—therned shows
called “Fingerbang” In the summer,
she will travel across the Atlantic to do
shows, as well as continue to pursue
her other projects

“I’ve really just made it a point to
do different  over the years — it’s

exciting to change  up,” said Cho

Pitt retires Knight, stays alive in Big East hunt

by Mike Gladysz
Spar/.1 E3110/*

It makes sense that on a night when Pitt
retired the jersey number of one of its best
guards in history, it also moved one step
closer to achieving something the guard
earned twice: a Big East regular season
title.

After pulling the No. 20 jersey of Bran-
din Knight into the rafters, Pitt took down
Marquette, keeping its conference title
hopes alive. V

But with a matchup against No.
1—ranked Connecticut looming, Pitt still
has some work and some help from an old
rival left. ’

The Panthers need to beat Connecticut
on Saturday, and No. 6 Louisville needs to
lose its last regular season game, which is
on the road against West Virginia Saturday
night. The Cardinals beat Seton Hall at
home last night 95-78.

If Pitt beats Connecticut and Louis-
ville loses to the Mountaineers, there will
be a three—way tie for first place in the Big
East. .

Pitt will get the No. 1—seed in the Big
East tournament, though, as it would have

 

Graduate Study at HIT

a 2-1 record against those teams, thus giv-
ing it the edge.

No matter what happens with Connect-
icut and Louisville, Pitt guaranteed itself a
two—day bye in the Big East tournament
next week and third place in the final con-
ference standings, meaning it won’t play
until Thursday and will have a maximum
of three games in the tournament.

Finishing among the top of the Big
East is something that Knight, now an as-
sistant coach for Pitt, is used to. Knight,
who played point guard for Pitt from
1999-2003, holds school records for career
assists, career assist average, career steals,
season assists and minutes played in a sea-
son.

He led Pitt to two consecutive Big East
regular season titles and its first ever Big
East tournament title. The Panthers also
made two NCAA Sweet 16 appearances in
that time.

Now in his third year of coaching at Pitt,
Knight works extensively with guards.

“I told Levance [Fields] I wouldn’t cry,
so I’m going to stick to that,” said Knight.
“This is the best place to play in the coun-
try. We have the best fans.”

Basketball, Oakland Zoo
help football recruiting

by Kyle Craig
Staﬂ Writer
Two years ago when LeSean McCoy was
ready to commit to the Pitt football team, the
first people to whom he publicly tipped his
hand were members of The Oakland Zoo, Pitt
basketball’s student cheering section
. On Feb. 14, the Pitt football coaching staff
hosted more than 100 football players who are
in their junior year of  school. One of the
central events of the day was the Pitt basketball
game against Cincinnati. And while basketball
and football are played on completely different
surfaces, the basketball team, along with The
Oakland Zoo, are stepping into big roles when
it comes to courting perspective football stars.
Mike Antonoplos, Pitt’s assistant director
of football operations, said in an interview last
week that the coaching staff

One of The Oakland Zoo’s best qualities is

its passionate portrayal of the University’s fan

base, said Antonoplos
‘The overall enthusiasm of the students and
the people at the basketball games can portray,
in the minds of the football recruits, what they
could see at Heinz Field, too,” said Antonoplos.
Davejedlicka, the president of The Oakland
Zoo, highlightedthe importance of the Zoo in
making an impression on recruits who are unfa-
miliarwith Pitt. ,
“Whether theyfre from out of state or even
out of town, [some players are] not exactly sure
what to expect from the schoo ” said Jedlicka.
“When they come to the Petersen Events Cen-
ter, they see 1,300 kids  up and down
and screaming for two hours cheering on Pitt”
The fact that the Zoo is

Kolby Gray, at quarterback from Houston,
recently signed a letter of intent to play for the
Panthers next season. Gray/s visit to Pittsburgh
in January included a tripto see Pitt play St:
]ohn’s. He said it was the fans, not just the game,
that got him  more about Pitt.

‘The fans were awesome,” said Gray. “I
[went] home and that’s all I talked about: ‘You
should have seen these guys at the basketball
game”’ ._ -
While Gray had given his commitment to
the coaching staff earlier in his visit, he was put
at ease by the reception players received from
the student section. ‘

“The fans deﬁnitely played a big part,” he
said. “They made you feel at home They made
you feel comfortable.” i

Gray said that  to a basketball game
gave him a positive impression of the Pitt fans

he looks forward to seeing duting the football‘

. “Obviously,  are going to want to do
what they can to get the best players possible,”
said Jedlicka. “Now, you need to be careful
about going over the line.”

 over the line includes  recruits’
names on barmers or presenting potential stars
with Oakland Zoo T—shirts.

Ultimately, the Zoo’s chief role in recruiting

will remain providing a positive image of Pan- ‘

ther sports fans.

The people at the Pete project students’ ex-
citement about Pitt’s sports programs, said An-
tonoplos. v

Each season, another class of "prospects
shapes their decisions in part based on their
experience at the Pete. Jedlicka said that bas-
ketball games —— and the fanfare around them
—— present an attractive opportunity to football
recruits. -

“I think it makes the athletes want to be
part of it,” saidjedlicka. “They really see that the
fans care for their team.” .— i '

Student Travel alert for Mexico  
Excerpts from the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs website:
hit9://travel.state.aov/travel/cis__r>a__tw/pa/i>a;3028.hlml#

This information is current as of Monday, Mar 02, 2009 10:17:27 GMT-0500 (EST).

This Travel Alert (February 20, 2009) updates security information for US. citizens traveling and living in Mexico.
Ir supersedes the Travel Alert for Mexico dated October 15 2008. and expires on August 20, 2009.

While millions of US. citizens safely visit Mexico each year (including thousands who cross the land border every
day for study, tourism or business); violence in the country has increased recently. it is imperative that travelers
understand the risks of travel to Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and whom to contact if one be— _
comes a crime victim. Common-sense precautions such as visiting only legitimate business and tourist areas dur~
ing daylight hours, and avoiding areas where prostitution and drug dealing might occur, can help ensure that travel '
to Mexico is sale and enioyable. »

- US. citizens who believe they are being targeted for kidnapping or other crirﬁes should nolify Mexican oflicials and the nearest
American consulate or the Embassy as soon as possihle, and should consider retuming to the United Stales.

v US. citizens should make every attempt to travel on main roads during dayiighthours, particularly the toll ("coma") roads,
which generally are more secure. . . . , y

. - US. citizen visitors are encouraged to stay in the well-known tourist areas of the cities. Travelers should leave their itinerary
with a lriend or family member not traveling with them, avoid travelingalone, and should check with their cellular provider prior
to departure lo confirm that their cell phone isycapabla of roaming on GSM or 36 international networks. Do not display expen-
sivevlooking jewelry. large amounts of money, or other valuable items. -

- US. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez,_ avoid isolated locations during
late night and early morning hours. and remain alertlo news reports. ' ' . - - - ‘

- U.S. citizens are urgad to be alert to safely and security concerns when visiting the border region.

« US. citizen victims of crime. in Mexico are urged lo contact the consular section of the nearest U.S. oonsulaleor Ernbassy lor
advice and assistance. Contact information is provided at the end of this message. - ‘

3 During demonstrations or law enforcement operations. U.S. citizens are advised to remain in their homes or hotels, avoid large
crowds, and avoid the downtown and surrounding areas. Since the liming and routes of scheduled marches and demonstra-
tions are always subject to change. US. citizens should monitor local media sources for new developments and exercise ex.
lreme caution while within the vicinity oi protests. The Mexican Conslitulion prohibits political activities by loreignersxand such
actions xpay result in detention andlor deportation. U.S. citizens are therefore advised to avoid participating in demonstrations

‘or other activities that might be claemed political by Mexican authorities. As is always the case in any large gathering: U.S. citi~
zens should remain alert to their surroundings. ‘ ~ ~ ' .

. To see the entire travel alert, and for detailed information for staying sale in -i
