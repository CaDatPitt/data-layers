‘Student Leaders .1!/lust Serve as Examples’

Marty Landy To Dfiscussi

- Leadership At} Tap Day; Dinner

Student Government president, Martin Landy, will speak  Ii

at Tap Day Dinner tomorrow night in the traditional position
of senior speaker for the occasion. ‘

Landy will discussstudent leadership on this campus:

what it is and what its resporIsibilities.are..

“I generally think,” he indicated in summarizing the
text of his address, “that
student I e a d e r s must
serve as examples.‘ The
role of the University is
to create men, to create
real people — and the stu-
dent leader must be a real
person.” - Landy also plans‘
to point ‘out that student
activities are educative
processes.‘

His position as SG presi-
dent has prepared him to dis-
cuss this topic, Landy feels,
for he has viewed it to be his a
responsibility to be concerned
with the Welfare of the total
student body. His resulting in-
student .
leaders has made him aware,
he explains, of what students , _ _,
are and what their responsi- ' '
bilities are. ~ MARTY LANDY

_ Besides being SG president, Landy is also a member of
Phi.Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Druids. He is a
Senior Worthy and has traveled in Europe under a Carnegie
Foundation grant. . - _
_ The speaker, for the‘ noon Tap’ Day ceremonies will be

Ever see the “Progress Corps” in action?

Its members are at work all over the free world, helping
millions of people to progress toward better lives.

In India, West Germany, Italy, and in the United
States, they’re building nuclear power plants, launching
the age of low-cost atomic power. A A

In Samoa, they're developing an educational TV net-
work to battle illiteracy . . . while in Pittsburgh, they’re
working with teachers to help high school students learn

more about computers.

In Wales, they’re putting the ﬁnal touches on Europe's
first computer-controlled steel mill. Near Los Angeles
they've scored a world first by putting a computer in
charge of cement mill operations.

In Brazil, Pakistan and Ghana, they’re providing
extra-high-voltage equipment for huge dams to harness
these nations’ hydroelectric power. For Malaysia, they’re
supplying high-power diesel locomotives . . . for Norway,

a marine engine -room to power oneof the world’s largest

supertankers.

The membersof the “Progress Corps” are the men
and women of General Electric, working toprovide the
key to progress—low-cost electric power and better ways
of putting it to work. Many are engineers. Many others
are international lawyers,_nphysicists, ﬁnancial special-

ists, marketing experts.

General Electric is growing both atxhome and abroad.
If you’d like to grow with us, talk to your placement

committee members pledged to raise $200 apiece, and a total
of $24,000 was raised, enabling 76 students to attend college in
September. '

Recipients of ﬁnancial aid from NEED are attending col-
leges throughout the country. Under chairman Rabbi Silver of
the Temple of Emmanuel and co-chairmen Mrs. James Jordan

.. and Mrs. Louis,Reizenstein, the group is in the‘ process of
setting up a formal organization. “We ‘hope to raise $250,000 by
next September,” explained Mrs. Jordan., “We’Ve just been
nibbling at the problem so far. pWe have a waiting list now,
so by _September we’d like to double the number‘ of students
aided.”

“We are helping by our voices,” commented Ron David,
president of Men’s Glee Club. "They are singing a selection or
sacred and secular music. ' '

rangedby Flor Peeterstand sung by the joint groups. Lorenzo

 Editorial: Vrana For President

 

--1

"—L   News  Wednesday, February 26, 1964

 

Politics is a funny business and, unfortunately, a little ridculous at times. This
certainly must be considered the case in to day’s election. We are being asked to select
a Student Government for next year yet the students are being given very little
chance to do any selecting. " - .

John Vrana is running for president and Ron Camino is running for vice-presi-
dent. John Vrana is the only person running for president.and the same is true in the
vice-presidential category. Is this ridiculous? ’ T

Not..real_ly. John Vrana has all the qualiﬁcations necess-ary to be a successfu

’ president once he gets into ofﬁce. He is a’ good bit older than most students here, having

served in the air force for three years before coming to the University. This gives
him a more mature and a broader outlook on things. He is a sharp student possessing

' well over a 3.50 QPA, and knows his way around among. administrative circles. He is

the type of fellow who can get a job accomplished. Being business manager of The Owl
requires such talents in excess. —

Perhaps his greatest asset, however, is the fact that he has never served on SG -
and knows actually very little of the, way in which the organization functions. Because
of this he will not be restricted by procedures of the past of which he knows nothing.
When a problem comes up he will not appoint a committee to investigate it as has
been done in the past. Instead he will point his ﬁnger at a Senator and say: “Take

care of it!” and it had darn better well be taken ca

know the reason why.

re of,_ and plenty fast too, or'he’ll

When a problem arises with the administration he will not crawl over to Dr.

Rankin’s oflice and beg for a piece of his time but will barge in and demand action. 

- This is the type of leader that SG needs and forsaking any calamity, John ‘Vrana will

be-the next president of SG. ’
The problem is that he is running on

the Able Party. This party is in business to

win elections and not to furnish candidates who can do a good job once elected. To the
Party, a good vote getter is worth twenty competent people. ' .

jWe do not say that there are no people running on the Able Party ticket who
would not make good Senators. However, for heaven’s sake, don’t vote the straight Able
ticket. It’s a sure way to smother the initia tive‘ of the man who is elected president.

Look Out, Cliburnl

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

One of everyone’s secret ambi-
tions is to play a musical instru-
ment . . . to express themselves,
you know. Well, I skidded pretty
fast through that stage and all I
got for my money was some tor-
tured moans and rasps out of a
tortured clarinet. (Sure, just like
Pee Wee Russell).

‘So I passed through that stage
after about six months of building
up my embrochure — that’s a

_tough lip, man. The clarinet and I

(sob) parted company. I told my-
self I’ll stick to my singing,
though it’s mostly the bath-tub
variety. But I would like to learn
to’ read music somewhere along
the way. That’s it! Up to the music
department for advice. Music
eleven is for me?.Little did I sus-
pect . . .

Let me tell you about this

' course. In Music 11, you learn the
rudiments of music — chords, in-

version, cadences-. You learn to

sing in syllables — do, re, mi and

that jazz. And you learn to play
the piano, that is, you are expected

This — my piano-playing — is

essay. Can you bear with me,
please. It’s about these three blind
mice . . . _

It seems that the song for learn-

The first one is a simple unison
arrangement with both hands.
This little number’ was my ﬁrst
piano solo. I want to tell you how
it _feels to play your ﬁrst piano
solo. You don’t realize, I know.

You’ve heard of the pent-up
emotion at soldiers’ departures for
the Far East? You know the emo-
tion you feel in a three—second-
left situation with your. team be-
hind by one and you gettin-g ready
to take the last shot? It is the
same as you feel the ‘-searching
glance, of your music professor
looking around for a volunteer “to
show how you’re getting along the
piano.” Sure, you evade his glance,
pretending you’re ﬁnishing your
notes . . . but, my friend, your
number is up.

“Ah, Mr. Niederberger, what
have you prepared for us today?
What opus are you going to per-
form?” The prof smiles.

You pick yourself up out of the
seat — slowly, to .be sure — re-
luctantly, to be sure — and you
take your book along with you so
you can pretend that you’re really
reading the notes and, you sneak
up to the piano stool.’

“. . . Ah . . . well I would like
to play . . . uh . . . Three Blind
Mice . . . the ﬁrst arrangement.”

ﬁrst solo —' my piano debut. Do

you know what this means? You
don’t. It means I join my family at
last. Everyone of them has played‘
the piano at one time or "another.

It latches on to your emotions. It

enfeebles your already-uncoordi-
nated ﬁngers. Your composure
crumbles. Yes, you start to choke.
You get that “I don’t belong here”
feeling—the one you last experi-
enced when you were a freshman
at this gigantic university. How-
ever, duty calls.

And one thing. You suddenly
realize how ridiculous you are to
be sitting there quaking over
Three Blind Mice. It makes you

agine how stupid you ‘look.’ You

rangement of Three Blind Mice.

For the moment you forget those
smug 1ooks.that your eleven-year-
old brother gives you when you
practice your opus on the piano at
home. (Incidentally, our piano
sounds like a ragtime harpsi-
c h o r d.) This eleven-year-old
smart-aleckhas been playing since

'he.was six and has utter contempt

for your rendition of Three Blind
Mice.

As a matter of fact, as soon as
you close your book after a gruel-
ling practice session, he slides onto
the piano bench and before you
can leap away he plays an original
version of Three Blind Mice that
sounds like a combination of
Artur Rubinstein and Oscar Peter-
son. Then he feeds you "his vicious
smile. Why, he doesn’t even bother
to look at you after he has de-
stroyed you.

But there is always next week’s
solo to worry about. So you work
on your second solo. Soon it’s that
voice again . . . “What opus have

United States foreign policy has been hampered by the lack of
constructive criticism. Only recently has there been any serious
questioning of our assumptions which guide policy in South Viet-
nam. Newspaper columnists like Reston and Lippmann have been
spurred by DeGaul1e’s maneuvers in Asia and our deteriorating
' 3 military position in South Vietnam to call for a
reconsideration of the possibility of neutralizing
both North and South Vietnam. -

One issue, however, still seems too delicate to
play with. That is Cuba. Within the last two
weeks our paranoia over Cuba led us into what
, the Canadian Toronto Globe termed a ludicrous
5 picture. The State Department encouraged

as a deliberate provocation. Castro supposedly
had planned to use their arrest as a pretext for

 

putting pressure on Guantanamo. Yet how was A

Castro to know that the U. S. would imprison the crews, when ‘the
federal statute which deals with territorial water encroachments
provides for no penalties? How was Castro to know that we would
give the crews to the state of Florida to punish them for ﬁshing
without a license? Obviously the man couldn’t have such "foresight.

Very few ‘Americans, however, were aware of this. Readers of
_The,New York Times editorial page, unlike most Americans, had
the opportunity to get a sober perspective on the ﬁshing boat inci-

dent. Yet even the'Times,' our best newspaper, is not immune to‘
V the hysteria which clouds our thinkingiabout "Cuba.

Herbert L. Matthews an editor of The New York Times, went
to Cuba last fall. He came back with a report that challenged most
of our accepted views’ of Castro and the Cuban- Revolution. He

rejects the view that Castro is a puppet of the Soviet Union or”

Cuban ‘communists: He points out that Castro says the‘ Russian

missiles were put in Cuba at Castro’s request because he feared _

another U. S. invasion. - In addition, he argues that-the greater part
of the children of the poor are “well fed, well taken care of, well

(One of his conclusions is that, A “Now that ﬁve years have
passed it is surely time for American officials, and the American
public to realize that whatever they want to think of Fidel Castro,

' he is one of the most extraordinary” men of oifr "age. The U.’ S.

has paid heavily for a shocking, underestimation of Castro’s intelli-
gence and abilities.” . , . I —
Matthews’ report,~however, was never published in his town"
newspaper. Finally, the Hispanic American Institute at Stanford
University published the report. There could be .var‘ious explana-
tions of the Times’ failure to print the story. Inthe 1955 investiga-
tion of the Internal Security subcommittee headed by Senator East-
land the Times was the chief target. In 1960 the same committee
directed‘its attention against Matthews speciﬁcally, for his;,1,957 re-.,
ports on interviews with Castro. Vestiges of ‘McCarthyism still‘

"poison our body politic.

Thus. The New York Times, a few weeks ago, did what was

much safer. They reprinted from the New Republic a sympathetic

report on Cuba written by a French journalist, Jean Da‘nie1."Yes,
it is safer to have a man who 1is,xnot an American who works for
The New York Times challenge American’ thinking and policy.

, No one thinks about Cuba;“"ever’yone reacts. When Prime
Minister Home stated that England would continue to trade, with
Cuba, Senator Wayne Morse, considered to be a liberal, "promptly
issued the statement that England would do anything for a- buck.
There was no consideration of Home’s argument that ‘a Communist

, with a full, stomach is less dangerous than a hungry Communist.
Cuba is the most dangerous topic in America today. Politicians ‘

who attempt to be objective risk political suicide. Yet because we
live in a democracy it is imperative that the alternatives’ be de-
bated. Could Castro be split away from the Soviet bloc? We not
011137 deal with, but give aid to Yugoslavia. Why not Cuba? These

If the Panther basketball team met Du-
quesne in the ﬁnals of the NIT and found
out thatiMossie Murphy was oﬁiciating, there
is little doubt that Bob Timmons and his team
would be disgruntled. Not that the honesty of
Murphy would be ques-
tioned,but that just isn’t
exactly the type of situa-
tion which is strived for
in athletics. -

Yet -this is almost
the same fate which
awaits visiting teams
that play at the Field
House. They don’t ﬁnd a

Pitt doing the refereeing;
' but there is a Pitt alum-
nus handling the oﬁicial
clock. As was proven in
the Duquesne and Syracuse games this year, the
operator of the clock plays an important part
in the outcome of the game.

 

BOB’ SIVIIZIK

eferee Sho

Originally Horse Czarnecki, head of the
athletic department’s ground crew, handled the
clock. But after the Duquesne game Horse re-
signed his post. Bobby Lewis, Panther base-
ball coach, held the job last year, but didn’t
want it this season. Horse ﬁlled in the interim.

Dick Kress, a Pitt alumnus and former
athlete "here, took over for Czarnecki.

It is not the intent of this column to ques-
tion the honesty or integrity of Lewis, Czar-
necki or Kress. This column does question the
sense which lets such a situati.on exist.

We think there is a very simple solution

to the matter. The person running the clock is
paid eight dollars a game. This approximately
is the same,pay that a basketball ofﬁcial refere-
eeing City League high school or independent
games receives. It would make a lot more
sense and cause quite a few less embarrassing
situations if one of these oﬂicials was hired _to
handle the clock ‘for Field House games.

If a diflerentofﬁcial was hired to run the

uld  FH Clock

clock each game, there would seldom- be
charges, no matter how ill-founded, of having
a homer on the clock.

But it is doubtful if athletic director Frank
Carver will make such a move. “I’m perfectly
satisﬁed with the work of Dick Kress. I don’t
know a person I trust more.” -

Carver probably has strong reasons for his
statement. He has known Kress for a long
time and is convinced of his honesty. “You may
be a fan before the game,” Carver said, “but
once that game starts you’re an oﬁicial and
your whole attitude changes.” A

Kress is honest. So are Czarnecki and Lewis.-
But the fact remains that Fitzgerald Field

"House is acquiring a reputation of having a

home team clock. People don’t remember how

the clock -hurt Pitt twice last season, they only

remember how it helped them this year.
Carver could remedy this situation by

_ hiring an official to run the clock. It would put

an end to most arguments and put some sense
into the game.. 1 ‘~ ~

Panther Wrestlers
Battle Penn State
In Final Home Meet

By FRANK SMIZIK .
The showdown for Eastern wrestling supremacy will be
staged at Fitzgerald Field House Saturday night at 8 p.m. ,The
Panthers will be trying to ﬁnish the season with a four-meet

winning streak while Penn State sports a ﬁve-meet winning‘

streak.

All past results for the second guessers to ponder over are of
no use in evaluating each team’s chances. The most recent op-
ponent for the Panthers, Lehigh, clobbered‘ Penn State, 25-5,
while the Panthers beat Lehigh, 19-13. But Penn State beat
Navy, a team considered best in the East. . . .

A common factor which has plagued both teams this season
is the loss of key’ wrestlers due to scholastic problems. Three
men from the Lions’ squad have been lost to coach Charlie

Tom Balent, 123-pounder, third in the East and third in
NCAA at 115-pounds; Bob Haney, who tied ’Mike Johnson
last year; and one of the East’s best 191,-pounders, Ed
Pohland, are the Lions declared ineligible. ‘

L Panther Coach Rex Peery, who made some surprise moves

last week, can be expected to do the samethis week. Ken Barr

and Lee Hall will probably move up to their usual weights of

191 and 177 pounds, respectively, since Penn State is strong

throughout’ the middleweight classes.

Dino Boni may also be forced to move up to 157 pounds

because State is weaker at that position and Boni would have a

better chance of gaining a victory. If Peery does move Boni he

will either insert Don Caslow or Clair Riley into the 147.pound

spot.

Despite the loss of three men and the possibility of
strategy, Speidel has a strong team and should make this match
the Panthers’ toughest of the season.

John Windfelder, the Lions’ 123-pounder, hasicome on
to be a strong winner, undefeated after being tied in his
first match of the season against’ Cornell. ‘

At 130-pounds Speidel may make a change of his own.
Mark Piven is his usual man, but his chances against Mike
Johnson aren’.t bright. Piven'may.move up to 137 pounds where
he would meet Frank O’Korn, whom he beat last year, 8-4.

Penn State’s George Edwards, at'147 pounds, is one of the
best, if not the best, in the East in his division. He ‘is the reason
Peery may move Boni up to 157-pounds. His only loss ‘this
season was to Doug Koch of Lehigh and he was undefeated last
season in dual meets.

Joe Eremus will probably wrestle at 157-pounds for
the Nittany Lions, while undefeated Marty Strayer will
oppose the Panthers’ entry in the 167-pound division. Strayer
finished second in the East and reached the quarter-finals
of the NCAA championships last season. ‘

At 1-77-pounds, Dick Walker, who dropped down from 191,
will probably meet Hall. . .

Ellery Seitz will be the 191-pounder. He pinned Barry
Raichlin, Syracuse, who had pinned Bill Beck earlier in the
season. Beck, however, will probably be put against heavy-
weight Don McKenna, while Barr will meet Seitz.

Panthers Visit Tech 1 Tonight; p

Play at Penn State Saturday  

A scrimmage "against

. Carnegi.e.Tech tonight, list-

ed as a regularly scheduled

game, and a contest at Penn
State Saturday are all that re_-

‘,main of the Panther basketball

team’s 1963-64 schedule.

It ' Pitt should win these
games they would end. the reg-
ular season with an 18-6 mark
compared to a 19-5 record last

year. The Panthers have won all "

12 games at the Field House and

need wins in the next two games

to ﬁnish 6-6 on the road.
Tonight's game against the
Tartans at Skibo Gym should
give coach: Bob Timmons fur-
ther opportunity to use his"
second team. The ﬁrst game
‘between the two teams ‘ended
with Pitt the winner,’ 108'-75.
Second team
Lovett, who has played in 20 of

the Panthers’ 22 games, should

see considerable action against
Tech. Lovett has scored 98
points on the season and is just
short of a ﬁve point average.

The.last time Pitt and Tech
played, 12 Panthers scored.
Since that game, the Tartans
have lost six of seven games.
On Saturday they halted a six
games losing streak with a 7.4-
64 win over Allegheny, for
their sixth win of the year.

The game against Penn State
should be a much tougher con-
test. The Nittany Lions lost to
Army last Saturday _and knock-
ed themselves out of the NIT.
State will be looking to reverse
an earlier season loss to the
Panthers, 69-60.

As usual, coach John Egli
is expected to use a zone de-
fense. If Pitt continues to do
as well as theyhave been

doing the past two years
against zone defenses, then
they should have little trouble
against State. ’
“Dave Roman and Dave Sauer
prefer, to play against zone de-
fenses,” said Timmons. Both
have done exceptionally well

State isnot taller than the Pan-
thers, they do have_ an overall

Weiss, who leads the team with
a 20 point average.

Saturday both’ Cal Sheffield

and Brian Generalovich pass- .

highest; scorer in Pitt history.
Generalovich now has 1061
points, seven more than Shef-

the Tartans gives him a total of
402 on the season. He leads all

"scorers with an 15.2 average.

West Virginia will provide the Panther
gymnasts with their ﬁnal dual meet of
the season Saturday night at 6 p.m. and
the local squad hopes that last will also be
least. Fortunately, this may be the case
since the Mountaineers will probably be
‘the least talented opponent that the Pan-
thers have faced all year, with the possible
exception of Slippery Rock.

Coach Warren Neiger is optimistic about
chances for a victory. “I’d have to say that
this is one meet in which we should be

favored," he stated. -“I have scouted them .

  
  

Gymnasts Face WVU In Final Meet Saturday‘ 

and I believe that we've got a little bit
more than they do."

Neiger also brought up the possibility
of a change in the scoring system for
this contest. “I’d like to go back to the
old method this one time,” he said.
Each of our squads has been hurt by,
lack of» depth and I feel that it will be
fairer for both of us.” '

The Panthers used the 6-4-3-2-1 scoring
system only one other time this year and

that meet provided them with .their only.

Defensive Play Proves Valuable

Dave Sauer Vital F ac tor in Panthers Getting
Invited to National Invitational Tournament

By ART FLEISCHNER

Throughout his four years here, Dave Sauer has
remained steady in one aspect of basketball -— de-
fense. His scoring has ﬂuctuated, hi's dribbling has
been shoddy, his foul shooting often inaccurate, and.
his rebounding inconsistent.

But he has always been the best defensive player
in the Panthers’ front court; the man coach Bob Tim-
mons assigns to guard the,opposition’s best offiensive
threat. , .

Sauer has improved all his faults except drib-
bling, which he maintains needs the most work. His
defensive play, which has been most effective this
season, has helped the Panthers get an NIT bid.

Timmons said,'“We’re not a big team and we
have to play good defense. We are lucky to have
a player like Sauer who can cover the other
team’s best scoring threat.”

After almost every win this year, Timmons has
mentioned ‘Sauer’s A name, mostly for .,_his defensive
work. In fact, it is now almost as routine as _T1m-
mons matter-of-factly states, “of course Sauer played
a good defensive game for us.”

After the Panthers’ 69-67 win over Syracuse two
weeks ago in which Sauer held the Orangemen’s Dave
Bing to four points, Timmons‘ remarks were ‘not
routine. He said, “Bing hit his average of 22 against
us up at Syracuse, but today Sauer held him to four
while he covered him. '

“We needed this game to get a tournament
bid, and I consider Sauer’s defensive work just
as important as Cal Shefﬁeld’s scoring.”

Sauer himself states, “I enjoy playing defense.
When, I’m covering a man who’s only averaging eight
points or so, I tend to get lax. I prefer to guard some-
one who has better than a .20 point average.” '

Sauer covered Jim Manhandt of Fordham, Bill
Leggins of George Washington, Mike Silliman of
Army and Cazzie Russell of Michigan, all of whom
are ’averaging over‘20 points a game. Sauer held each.
to approximately half their average. .

“It was a challenge covering those players,’ said
Sauer. “I get more excitement out of playing a man-
to-man defense instead of a zone. When I’m playing-
man-to-man, I know where my opponent is all.the
time. It’s a personalbattle.”

Sauer admits to playing much better at home
this year, but can’t explain why. His perform-
ance against Temple, last Wednesday, in which
he led all scorers with 22 points, bears him out.
He has managed to lead the team in scoring four
times this season, all at the Field House, and has
better than av12 point average.

Thus, despite his ﬁne all-around play this season,
defense remains Sauer’s strongpoint, and the factor
which has helped the team make a tournament for
the second straight year. Watching Sauer -play one
comes to the conclusion that he would be satisﬁed if
Pitt won the game, 2-0. '
