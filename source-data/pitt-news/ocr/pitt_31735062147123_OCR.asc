Scholastic Group
Prepares Award
To College Senior

Pi Tau Phi Sponsors New Honor
For Student Showing Greatest
Recent Gain In Average

Pi Tau Phi, scholastic honorary fra-
ternity of the College, will present a
;yearly award to one or more gradu-
ating seniors who, in their last two
"years, have shown the greatest im-
provement in their work.

On the committee for the award
are Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel as-
sistant to the dean of the College,
chairman; George Carver, professor
-of English; Betty Black, 36, secre-
tary of the fraternity; Herrymon
ltlauer, 36; and Israel Goldberg, 36.

Meeting at 3:30 o'clock today, the
committee will decide upon the exact
-qualiﬁcations for the award. Gold-
‘berg, president of Pi Tau Phi, said:

“It will not be purely an objective
basis which we shall use to determine
‘the winners. The award will be given
to encourage students to improve
"their Work in their last two years in
-school, when interest is centered in
their major ﬁeld.”

At the fraternity’s me_eting Thurs-
~day evening in the Cathedral, Edward
Parrack, C36, chairman of the eligi-
bility committee, presented a list of
names of eligible students in the Col-
lege. Juniors and seniors who have
maintained a median average of 2.2
or above were elected to membership.
The students elected will be tapped
on Scholars’ Day, March 13.

After the business meeting, Norman
Horowitz, C3'6, read a paper on
“Science and Mora.1s.” Following a
discussion of Horowitz’s paper, Pro-
fessor Carver spoke on “Richard Ay-
ton, Forgotten Essayist.”

Refreshments__ were served under
the direction of Sylvia Fixel, C36,
head of the committee.

Engineers’, Mines
Schools inspected

National Council Committee Here
To Rate Technical Divisions:

So that they might inspect the fa-

cilities and rate the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines, the inspection
and rating committee of the En-
gineers’ Council for Professional De.-
velopment visited the University Fri-
day and Saturday.

This committee, headed by Dr. Carl
Compton, president of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, consists of
prominent engineers and engineering
educators. E. A. Holbrook, dea.n of
the Schools of Engineering and Mines,
is a member of the board but natural-
ly did not aid in the rating of his
own school.

As the department of chemical en-
gineering has already been approved
by the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers, it will not be inspected
again. The Schools of Engineering
and Mines have already been approv-
ed by the University of the State of
New York, the rating bureau of that
state.

Colleges of engineering which pass
this inspection will be placed on an
approved list which will be used by
various state engineering licensing
boards i11 their work of licensing pro-
fessional engineers.

The results of the present inspec-
tion will not be known for several
months.

Graduation Applications

This is the last day that stu-
dents in all the schools, including the
Graduate School, who expect to get
degrees in June, 1936, may ﬁle appli-
cations in the oﬁices of the various
schools. Those. who do not do this
will have to defer graduation until
August.

Information about applications may
be obtained in the oﬁices of the
schools.

Babel At Heinz House

 

Sigma Kappa Phi Laclet Alle Sprachfreuncle Zu
Einem Gesellschaftlichen Abend Ein. Ce Sera Une
Soiree Dramatique, Musicale. Prid. Non. Mar.

 

From the departments of modern and classical languages comes the an-
nouncement that Sigma Kappa Phi, national honorary foreign language fra-
ternity, will open Heinz House to every student interested in foreign lan-

guages on Friday at 7:45 o’clock.

The program will consist of plays,¢

songs, dances, and readings by the
German, French, Italian and Classical
Clubs. It is revealed that a genuine
German Band will go through its
“eins, zwei, drei, go ahett.” And all
this for the price of an enjoyable eve-
ning, and nothing more.

The language departments have
their own inimitable invitations to
present, which, when translated,
might mean something.

The German department, via Dr.
Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant professor
of modern languages, says:

“Sigma Kappa Phi, die Vereinigung,
die solche Studenten ehrt, die sich in
fremden Sprachen ausgezeichnet
haben, ladet hiermit alle Soracl1-
freunde zu einem gesellschaftlichen
Abend ein, um dreiviertel auf 8 Uhr
am Freitag, den 6. Maerz findet diese
gemuetliche Gesellschaft statt. Tanz,
Erfrischungen und Unterhaltung sind
frei.”

From the inner office of Dr. Whit-
ford H. Shelton, professor of modern
languages, came the French announce-
ment:

“La Societe

d’Honneur pour les

etudiants de langues etrangeres, Sig-
ma Kappa Phi, invite tous les amis
des langues a une Soiree dramatique
et musicale le vendredi, 6 mars, a 19
heures 45 a la Heinz Maison.”

The Italian department has this to
say: “Sigma Kappa Phi, fraternita
honoraria e nationale delle lingue
straniere, estende cordialmente un
invite a tutti gli studenti e i loro
anuci interessati all lingue a venire a
un divertimento, venerdi sera, ll 6
marzo alle sette e quarantacinque alla
casa di Heinz.”

But even the grandpappy of them
all has something to say. The Latins,
claimed dead, present their invitation
for the scheduled lively meeting:

“Sodalitas quae decus eis studiosis
linguarum. alienarum _ attribuit, Sigma
Kappa Phi, omnes amicos linguarum
in convivium convocat, prid. Non-.
Main, prima vigilia media, apud
Domum Heinsium.”

For once the Greeks did not have a
word for it. But then our linotypers
and proof readers may rejoice. All we
can add, for their sake, is to save
March 6 for a Kalos, Kale, ﬁne eve-
ning at the Heinz Acropolis.

Forum Committee
Presents Laidler

Student Faculty Group Will Begin
Program With Meeting Today

“We are trying to ﬁll a long-felt
need, an unlimited forum,” said
Charles W. Herald, C35, chairman of
the Student Faculty Forum commit-
tee. “To accomplish our aims,” he
continued, “we are bringing Dr. Harry
W. Laidler to campus today at 2:30

o’clock. Dr. Laidler will speak on
“Which Way America,” at Heinz
House.---~  -  

Dr. Laidler has been executive di-
rector of the League for Industrial
Democracy since its inception more
than 15 years ago, and has been a di-
rector of the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research since 1920.

The speaker is a graduate of Wesley-
an University and received his Doctor
of Philosophy degree at Columbia
University in 1914.

‘Dr. Laidler is the author of many
books and pamphlets, among which
are ‘‘'History of Socialist Thought;”
“The Road Ahead;” and “socializing
Our Democracy.” Dr. Laidler has al-
so written “Concentration in Ameri-
can Industry,” a textbook used in sev-
eral courses by the department of
economics.

“There will be absolute freedom of
discussion on all sides at this forum,”
Herald concluded.

Members of the committee, in addi-
tion to Herald, are Betty Wainwright,
C37; Howard Lutz, C36; Leonard Se-
der, C37; and Robert D. Ayars, profes-
sor and head of the department of ac-
counting.

College Orientation Group
To Plan Religious Program

Special committees from the wo-
men’s college orientation classes are
planning a religious education pro-
gram for the freshman class which
will meet at 3:30 o’clock Thursday in
Room 114, Alumni Hall.

It is intended that committees con-
fer with their college orientation
classes at the end of the regular class
hour. Thus they will have speciﬁc
suggestions to aid in drawing up the
proposed program.

The entire freshman class heard a
talk by Dr. Bernard C. Clausen last
week. The special committee will
plan the rest of the religious educa-
tion program.

Students Outsmart Faculty Members
In Business Institute Spelling Bee

 

The tables were turned at the PBI.

Spelling Bee Thursday night as the
faculty of the School of Business Ad-
ministration “took a beating” at the
hands of the students.

It was a memorable event with un-
speakable as well as unspellable
words such as hexylresorcinol and
transcendentalism ﬂoating around
Room 1309, Cathedral. VVhile Alfred
Berkovitz, BA36, dispensed words
which would have troubled old Noah
lVebster himself, aspirants for ortho-
graphical honors withered under the
onslaught and fell by the wayside.

The unfortunate were weeded out
in a match between student teams of
eight each led by Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the School and J. Ell-
wood Amos, instructor in ﬁnance. In
this battle, the Dean’s forces were
defeated.

The remaining students were pitted
against the crack faculty vowe1-sling-
ing aggregation. Here the fun be-
gan. As Berkovitz relentlessly select-
ed excerpts from the dictionary be-
fore him the ﬁrst of the teams of six
began to fall into the class of also-

rans. Edgar Dowling, instructor in
commerce, and Mr. Amos soon were
among the victims and Dr. Tippetts
fell victim to his own brainchild».

In a short time the ﬁeld was cut
down to ﬁve nerve-wracked contest-
ants, including three faculty members,
one student and one pseudo-student.
Dr. J. M. Ferguson, who ordinarily
teaches economics, tripped up on
“corollary” by being too conservative
in using his consonants. A hireling
in the student ranks, in the person of
a downtown reporter who sensed a
good story, took a fall on the same
word.

Things went smoothly until Dr.
Francis D. Tyson guessed wrong on
the tongue-tickler, “Pterodactyl.” That
left the championship to be settled
either upon the head of Allan J.
Fisher, instructor in accounting, or
Ray Ehrman, C36. And then Fisher
erred ignominously on “rendezvous."
He couldn't make up his mind
whether there should be a “z” in it.
As a result the crown went to Ehr-
man, who can now at last feel an
air of superiority over the faculty.

Cadets Get Stern
For Military. Ball

Gardner, Eichler, Eddy Orchestras
Also Signed For March 20

Harold Stern, Richard “Hot Cha”
Gardner, ‘Carl Eddy, and Fran Eich-
ler will furnish the music at this year’s
Military Ball. Announcement of the
four bands was made Friday night at
the College Association dance.

As was predicted, two “name” bands

‘and two local orchestras were chosen.

Heading the list is Harold Stern’s
band, which has been in the national
lime likht of better modern music for
more than 12 years. Dur'ng that time
Stern has been associated with the
NBC coast-to-coast network. He played
for two and a half years at the Hotel
St. ‘Moritz, three years at the Hotel
Ambassador, and one year at both the
Biltmore and Hotel Montclair’s “Casi-
no in the Air.” For 22 summers he
has “supplanted the dancing waves
with dancing rhythms at Manhattan
Beach Park,” according to press re-
leases.

Richard “Hot Cha” Gardner, of
George Olsen fame, was formerly fea-
tured on two popular NBC programs.
Recently he was featured at Balti-
more’s Lord Baltimore Hotel, and
played over 'Columbia’s national hook-
up.

Named as one of the local units
was Carl Eddy, who plays over WJAS
three times weekly. Fran Eich1er’s
band, well-known to campus dance-
goers, rounds out the quartet of mu-
sic makers.

Tickets for the Ball will be on sale
today and may be obtained for $3
from the members of the Military Ball
committee.

The dance is scheduled for March
20 at the William Penn Hotel.

Engineering Informal!

Not Unlike CA Dance

Ballroom, Price, Even Orchestra All
The Same; lt’s This Friday At $1

It seems that the sequence of copy-
ing need not end with the CA dance
last Friday. If VVilliam Britton, ChE,
were named as chairman of the affair,
the CA replaced with EA, the date
this Friday, and the formal idea witl1-
drawn, the answer would be the EA
Spring Dance.

For Jimmy Bray will furnish the
music at the Hotel Schenley ball-
room, and the price is $1 a couple.
But the dance is informal.

Britton said, “We are not imitating
the CA Formal, but rather duplicating
it. We even hope that those attend-
ing the CA Dance will consider this
a one week long intermission and re-
turn to the Hotel Schenley ballroom
minus formal to attend a dance with
the same orchestra, at the same time
and same price.”

Tickets for this affair are being
sold by: James Shields, IE37, William
McQuade, CE37, Frank Obenauf,
EE37, Phillip Kurtz, ME37, Robert
Millar, AE37, Florian Majchrzak.
ChE37, Robert Smith, AE37, Elmer
Messer, EE36, Frank Hockensmith,
ME36, William Hall, CE36, Edward
Sheperd, IE36, and Britton.

Hedinburg At Seminar

At the Chemical Seminar Thursday
in the Old Mellon Institute, Dr. 0. F.
Hedinburg lectured on “Vital Products
and Their Synthesis.” Dr. Hedinburg,
a graduate of Wesleyan and Chicago
Universities, has a fellowship at the
Mellon Institute and is working on
insecticides.

Cap, Gown Fable
~ Of Students’ Own
Play Materializes

Sophomores ‘Sa.ﬁ'ron, Spanos Do
‘ Trick Of Decade; Townsend
Plan Supplies Plot Idea

:1 Robert Saffron should be writing
this story since it concerns him; but
then, maybe he wouldn’t do himself
justice.

For Robert Saffron, C38, together
with Nicholas Spanos, C38, has suc-
ceeded in contributing what will be
the “best Cap and Gown show in re-
cent years.”

The quote is that of Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant dea.n of men and
chairman of the production committee
of Cap and Gown. He released the
announcement after the committee
and Theodore Viehman, director of
the show, made their decision.

The competing script was written
by Theodore Whitaker, C38, and Jack-
son_Speer, C38. ,

The ﬁrst completely student-written
show since 1923, the Saffron-Spanos
opus is a modern satire on the Town-
send Plan.

“The boys have revised and rewrit-
ten and cooperated to make the book
as fine as possible,” according to Mr.
Biddle.

A title has not as yet been selected.

Chorus tryouts will start this eve-
ning at 9 o'clock in the Student Ac-
tivities building (Y Hut), where Mr.
Viehman’s office will be located in
Room 2. Eliminations will continue
on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
Veterans of last year will not have
to appear until Tuesday.

Cast tryouts are called for 2:30
o'clock today, 3:30 on Tuesday, and
2:30 Wednesday, in Room 244, Ca-
thedral.

“There will be no favoritism to vet-
erans,” declares Mr. Biddle.

Candidates for the business and
production staffs are asked to meet
tonight with the group.

Survey Results
. 0'
To Be Reviewed
By Psychologists

The Psychology Forum will hear
the results of a survey of the inter-
ests of employed and unemployed
persons in Allegheny County at 4:30
o’clock, today, in Room 308, Alumni
Hall. Glenn U. Cleeton, head of the
department of industrial education
and a member of the psychology de-
partment of the Carnegie Institute of
Technology, will talk on “Vocational
Interests.”

This survey has compared the in-
terests of an employed group of per-
sons, such as the sports they like,
or the magazines they read, to the
interests of a group composed of high
school and college students and un-
employed men and women.

The results of this survey have
been published in the magazine of the
Pittsburgh Personnel Association un-
der the title, “Occupational Adjust-
ments in Allegheny County.” The ad-
dress tonight is based on this article.

Dr. G. E. Jones, professor of psy-
chology, is chairman of the forum.

Students and faculty are invited to at-
tend.

Phelps To Speak Here

Mrs_ Mildred, E. Stegeman, sec-
retary to the Chancellor, an-
nounces that William Lyon P'helps,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of English at Yale, and emi-
nent columnist and critic, will
speak before the general student
body on April 29.

The number of bids entered totaled
161, with bids going to 129 men. Of
the bids accepted, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, with six new pledges, topped the
list. Closely following with ﬁve each
were Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Delta.
Theta. Kappa. Alpha Phi, professional

YM-YW CA Plan Another Tri-State
Student Conference At West Virginia

Another of the tri-state student
conferences is soon to be under way,
according to a report from the exec-
utive offices of the YMCA.

The conference is to be held at
West Virginia University March 14,
15, and 16, it was revealed.

W. W, Mendenhall, executive sec-
retary of the University YMCA, em-
phasized the fact that it will be a
conference devoted entirely to stu-
dent problems. It will attempt to
answer three questions:

1. “What is the true responsibil-
ity of a ‘Christian group in the society
of today?”

2. “Should it work primarily at
the point of changing persons, or the
social order?”

3. ‘‘In either case, what distin-
guishes it from other groups under-
taking similar work?”

For a full chance to discuss these
three problems, the leaders of the
conference have decided to break up
the delegates into two s_e1_ninars. The
program will also include three ad-

dresses by one of the foremost Amer-
ican professors of religion, Dr. Wil-
helm Pauck; recreational events be-
ing planned by the student leaders at
West Virginia University. In addi-
tion, there will be numerous -separate
sessions for the discussion of. the
place of religion in higher education.

The committee in charge of the af-
fair has also secured nine leaders
whom they believe outstanding in ad-
dressing college students. Two of
these, Dr. Roy Burkhart, pastor of
the First Community Church at C0-
lumbus, and Miss %R.ose Terlin of the
national staff of the YWCA, have al-
ready spoken to student groups at the
University, in connection with the
tri-state conference here last year.

Students who desire to join the
delegation from the University should
get in touch with Mr. Mendenhall or
Miss Helen .Battrick, executive secre-
tary of the YWCA. Full particulars
of the trip will be given to the appli-
cant. The YMCA headquarters are
in Room 801, Cathedral; and those of
the YWCA are in Heinz House.

‘And So They Are Graduated . . . ’

OME PEOPLE weren’t at all bothered, of course, but
to others the recent expeditions to the offices of the
various Schools in order to ﬁle graduation applications
brought a slight touch of something or other. When you
come right down to writing your name “just the way
you want it to appear on your diploma” you get an un-

comfortable feeling that the end is dangerously near.

This situation may have been particularly alarming to
those seniors who might have taken to heart some com-
ments of Mr. Heywood Broun the other day, This col-
umnist painted for the college senior a picture that was
anything but delightful. It pained him, he said, to speak
before senior classes, because each time he looked into
“their bright young faces——-or at any rate, their faces,"
he saw something there that denoted little realization of
the conditions the students would run up against as they
marched off with their diplomas.

He told of the New York editor who is employing only
college journalism graduates and making them oﬁice
boys at $15 a week, he told of the great numbers of peo-
ple now engaged in the pursuit of higher education and
he indicated a deﬁnite pessimism concerning what would
become of them. While he did maintain that the stu-
dents are proﬁting by paying more attention to the social
sciences and getting mixed up in all sorts of forums to
learn what the world is about anyway, his remarks con-
tinued in a pretty desperate vein and ended on a note
which the average prospective graduate wouldn't consid-

er worth ending on.
I It 82

There was something of this dismal outlook in a mo-
tion picture going the rounds last year, entitled “Gen-
tlemen Are Born.” The show opened with the graduat-
ing class singing “Alma Mater.” It closed with a repeti-
tion of the opening scene. By that time, after watching
the major and minor tragedies through which four fellows
of the class had passed, you doubted that they would
have done any singing at all, had they been able to fore-
see what was to come.

Some enterprising author or scenario writer might ﬁnd
it worthwhile to get off the beaten path and cook up a
few plots wherein the college boy clicks after gradua-
tion, is able to get married, and manages to pace the
sheriff over all the hurdles. This popular philosophy of
“out of the commencement procession and into the bread-
line” was originally designed as a gag; tl1ere’s no sense
in allowing it to become a permanent tradition.

We've always been impressed by the professor who
checked the despondent senior by asking if he knew just
how many of last year’s graduating class had starved to
death. You’ll get along, this fellow would say, you’ll be
able to live and marry and raise a family, just as your
mother and father did before you. Don't be too bothered
about it.

That attitude requires conﬁdence. But why shy away
from conﬁdence? “He can who thinks he can” may be a
better adage than it is a possibility, but it does go in the
right direction. After all, there is only one answer to
“he can't who thinks he can’t.”

The next instalment of Pep Talks For Seniors will ap-
pear in an early issue.

The Alger Boys

MONG OTHER THINGS, the year 1936 will be re-

membered as the end of a long drought in regard to
student-written Cap and Gown shows. According to an-
nouncements made Friday, the script by a couple of
sophomores named Robert Saffron and Nicholas Spanos
has been accepted by everybody concerned for the forth-
coming production of the all-male dramatic group.

These boys are to be congratulated for the evi-
dently ﬁne work they have done. Other student authors
who worked hard at producing less-successful scripts for
this year likewise deserve a stack of congratulations for
their efforts and interest. And while the bouquets are
being passed around, it might be well to toss a few in
the direction of the production committee, which stuck
to its guns until it had found what was wanted in the
way of student scripts.

Uncovering a couple of sophomores who can turn out a
show of the ﬂavor this one is reported to he seems com-
parable to having two of Dr. Sutherland’s boys blossom
out as All-Americans their ﬁrst year on the varsity. This
realization shouldn't do Messrs. Saffron and Spanos any
harm; fellows as smart as they are will realize that their
show is far from perfect now and that it won't be deﬁn-
itely beyond revision for the better until the curtain goes
up on the ﬁnal performance this spring.

It's hard to argue logically that an added impetus will
be given to the Cap anl Gown cast, choruses, and tech-
nical staffs this year because of the student-written
script, but certainly there will be some power about it to
make the boys Work harder than before. That will be
ﬁne for everybody.

Work begins tonight and after a little less than two
months we'll see what it is that the students have con-
cocted. Meanwhile Messrs. Saﬂron and Spanos may do

Boswell Collection

By Richard Cooper

What is probably the most important literary work ac-
quired by the University library this year has been re-
ceived al: the library in State Hall, according to J. How-
ard Dice, University librarian. It is a set of “The Pri-
vate Papers of James Boswell from Malahide Castle,”
published in 18 volumes at the printing house of Edwin
Rudge and designed by Bruce Rogers.

The set, bound and boxed in red boards, consists of
the papers of Boswell long thought destroyed, which
were found in 1927 and 1930 in the 700-ye_a.r-old Castle
of Malahide, just outside of Dublin. Upon ‘their discov-
ery the papers had been bought from Lord Talbot of
Malahide, a descendant of Boswell, by Lt. Colonel Ralph
Heyward lsham, who then brought them to the United
States.

Under the direction of Colonel lsham, work was be-
gun in 1929 by Geoffrey Scott preparing the papers for
publication. The undertaking was continued by Fred-
erick A. Pottle after the death of Dr. Scott in the same
year. Since then, volumes of the set have been pub-
lished from time to time, until recently the full set of
18 has been completed.

Included in the collection, considered the greatest
literary discovery of modern times, are documents of
considerable value to students of history and English
alike. There are 107 pages of the original manuscript
of the famous “Life of Samuel Johnson” and the com-
plete journal of Boswell’s trip with Johnson in 1773, of
which but two-thirds appeared in the original edition of
1785. The almost complete manuscript of the “Account
of Corsica” is likewise among these long-lost papers.

Also contained in the collection are the other journals
written by Boswell at different periods of his life. These,
along with more than 150 letters, throw new light upon
the lines of the biographer and his associates. There are
accounts of his meetings with Voltaire and Rousseau,
and of his last meeting with David Hume at the latter’s
deathbed. Most of the conversations recorded by Bos-
well in his journals were later used in the “Life.” Of
the letters there are many from Goldsmith, Burke, Vol-
taire, Chatham, Rousseau, and Burns.

This edition of Boswell’s Papers, containing several
facsimiles of the orignal documents, i-s limited to 570 sets.

I Bowman’ 3 Viewpoint

By John Martinco ’

The viewpoint of Dr. John G. Bowman on the contro-
versy between the University and Governor Earle was
broached Friday night as the Chancellor addressed a
large gathering of graduates at the annual alumni meet-
ing and Charter Day celebration at the University Club,

The Chancellor ﬁrst averred that he was not making a
reply to the Governor, rather, he explained, “I will try
to say what I believe. The University belongs to no po-
litical party. The very foundation of the University is
loyalty to the state of Pennsylvania.” In view of that,
he declared that it “owes loyalty to the governor.”

“The University grows out of local needs,” he said,
At this point, he expressed the belief that if the Gover-
nor would come to Pittsburgh for a month, “he would
have reason to be proud of Pennsylvania as he has never
been proud before.” He advised the alumni not to ﬁnd
fault. “Don’t tear down,” he cautioned, “but build up.”

He praised the plan for election of alumni to the Board
of Trustees. However, he warned the graduates “to be
very conscientious in the selection of the trustees and to
be careful that they don't use the office as a ‘badge of
honor’.” He reiterated, “The plan shows more intelli.
gence and wisdom than anything that has come to me in
recent years.” Finally, he asked that the administration
and the alumni work together in good will.

Substituting for Harold Obernauer, president of the
General Alumni Association, who was unable to attend
Dr. P. V. McParland, vice president of the organization’
stated that the alumni are behind the Chancellor and

trustees "100 per cent."

Dramatist Eugene B rieux’ Widow Corresponds

With Freshman Student In

These High Buildings Seem‘
Very Strange To Us, She
Says Of Cathedral

By Milton H. Lehman

Several letters from the widow of
Eugene Brieux, famous contemporary
French dramatist, are in the possess-
sion of Harry C. Colby, C39, student
in the French 6 class of R. H. Joini-
son, assistant professor of modern
languages.

“It all began last semester when
our class read M. Brieux’s drama, ‘La
Robe Rouge,’ ” Colby says. “In the
introduction was the statement that
Brieux answered all his own letters.
I wrote to him at once.”

The letter Colby received was from
Brieux’s widow, Madame Jeanne
Eugene Brieux, her husband having
died in 1932. The letter, edged in a
heavy black border as the sign of
mourning, was written in a ﬁrnr fem-
inine hand. Madame Brieux, after
stating that Brieux had died three

French Six Class’

V

‘Introduction To ‘La Robe
Rouge’ Began It All, Says
F rancophile Colby

years before, went on to compliment
Colby on his French. The letter told
of her husband’s interest in youth, of
his high ideals and his work, and
concluded with:

“You can read his works with bene-
ﬁt, If you wish later to enter more
into the intimacy of his work and
character, I am quite at your disposal
to give you any details or informa-
tion. But it is necessary not to wait
too long, as I am old.”

Member of the French Academy,
author of several crowned plays,
Brieux wrote for the French Theater
for 25 years. He liv-d in Paris,
where his widow now resides.
Her second letter to Colby was
written on Janury 29, exactly one
month after her ﬁrst. She mentioned
that she had taught Americans
French, offered some practical advice
to Colby on his study of French, and
encouraged him to write again. She
enclosed a postal card showing the
last home in which her husband lived,
and a postal exchange stamp a.nd a
pamphlet of resumees of his plays.
Her letter ended with:

“Permit an old lady, such as I am.

to send you this exchange stamp..
You have only to exchange it at the.
post office for a stamp of your own
country. Thus our correspondence-
will not weigh on your budget.
“Thank you for the card (Colby
sent her a picture of the Cathedral),

These high buildings seem very
strange to us.”

Now in Professor Johnson's class,
Colby studied French for three years-
at Clairton High School. This is not.
his ﬁrst international correspondence-
He has been writing to two girls in.
Carcassonne and Moiselle, to a boy in
Charente, and to an old man in Ger---
many. Besides his French, Colby has:
been studying German on the side. He
is a member of the orchestra and
string trio here and will appear in an
French play to be presented at Sig-
ma Kappa Phi’s Open House.

Cage;;Face EIC
Foes This Week

Meet Georgetowners Wednesday,
Penn State Quintet Saturday

Right in the thick of the torrid East-
ern Intercollegiate Conference ﬂag
race, the Panther cagers meet two
more league rivals this week, George-
town and Penn State, as they continue
to ﬁght for their fourth successive

conference championship.

Dr, Carlson’s boys will battle both
teams on the Stadium pavilion,
Georgetown's Hoyas being billed on
Wednesday night, while the State ﬁve
appears against the Panthers Satur-
day evening.

Of the two cage teams, Georgetown
will be the one for the Cats to fear
most. In their ﬁrst meeting over a
month ago the Capital team just bare-
ly nosed the Panthers out, 43-42, in a
game that required an extra period
to decide the winner. Since then,
however, the Pitt boys have chalked
up four straight conference triumphs
and the Hoyas have lost three
straight.

Unless something vital happens to
the Penn State varsity between now
and game time on Saturday, the Lion
outﬁt is headed for another league de-
feat. To date, everyone in the con-
ference has cleaned house at Penn
State’s expense with ‘the result that
the Lions hold down the cellar post
quite ﬁrmly. Eight losses out of
eight games is the State record.

Players’ Candida Avoids
Red Ink, Report Shows

“Candida” is pretty certain to
have ended up without a deﬁcit, al-
though 800 tickets are still out-
standing and, in many cases, unre-
ported 011, according to Gene
Cohen, C36, business manager of
Pitt Players.

Approximately $25 was collected
at the door during the two-night
stand of the George Bernard Shaw
play at the Pittsburgh Community
Playhouse, February 19 and 20.

Expenses for “Candida” were
lower than for previous produc-
tions. The royalty amounted to
$40 for the two nights, rental of the
auditorium. to $70, and incidentals,
including printing of tickets, pic-
tures, stamps to $25.

Dr. Carlson’s Pitt cagers completed;
their climb up the ladder to the top;
rung in the Eastern Intercollegiate;
Conference when they routed Carne-E
gie Tech, 29-21, Saturday evening in
the Skibos’ gym. The victory, strength-
ening the Panthers’ hopes for another
league title. at the same time dished
out a knockout blow to Tech’s titular"
ambitions.

Pitt now holds ﬁrst place with ﬁve
wins against two losses, while Tech’s
record shows six victories in nine
starts.

With both teams on edge, neither
club displayed true championship;
calibre, and it took another one of’
those famous second-half spurts tol
put the game in the bag for the Carl-!
sonmen. 

Playing very cautiously in the ﬁrst=
half, the Tartans scored three ﬁeld
goals and eight successful penalty
ﬁings and were able to leave the ﬂoor
at the intermission with a 14-13 lead.

Rags Radvansky’s pair of accurate
foul shots sent Pitt into the lead at
15-14, and from there on until the end
it was all Pitt. Midway in the period,
Macalka’s basket allowed Carnegie
to come within two points of the
Panthers, but four Cats, Noon, Spoto-
vich, Jesko, and Zeleznick, scratched
out that threat with a quartet of buck-
ets.

‘Spotovich and Johnson, with six
points apiece, sparked the Panther
offense, while Patt, with six markers,
was high man for Tech. James and
Jagnow played brilliantly for the Tar-
tans, the towering James using his
height to a great advantage by keep-
ing Pitt's shots from coming near the
basket.

Track Comebackl

Ex-Pitt Ace Stars In AMA Meet; 
Olson Squad Dominates Field

I
___ I

It was a typical Senior AMA chain-I
pionships up in the track house Satur-
with Pitt or ex-Pitt runners
again ﬂashing their heels to the best
track and ﬁeld performers in the tri-
state district. However, splotches of

an otherwise ordinary AMA meet.

An Everett Utterback, see any Pitt
for background, returned
very much to the front in the track
world when he hurled himself over 46
feet, seven inches of board and cin-
ders winding up 011 the far edge of the
long broad jump pit.

This series of leaps on his fourth
attempt, though still exactly ﬁve feet
short of Chubei Nambu’s world’s rec-
ord performance iii the 1932 Olym-
pics, convinved many spiked-shoe fans
in the district that perhaps there is
something to this hop, step and jump
business. At any rate, ‘Western Penn-
sylvania now has a very serious candi-
date for the American team entry in
the 11th Olmpiad at Berlin this sum-
mer.

In other outstanding roles were:
Pete Bennett with a leap of six feet,
four inches in the high jump, his best
of the year; Red Tost with at 4232.4
mile; Glenn Cooper, clocked at 5.4 sec-
onds in the 50-yard dash; and Ken Ry-

L0cice’s Duel With Dexter Woodford
Gave Don Harrison Biggest ‘Kick’

This is the first in a series of interviews of outstanding sports
figures at the University revealing just what event or events, play or
plays, athlete or athletes, gave them their biggest “kicks” or thrills.

“Unusual,” you will say. when you hear VV. Don Harrison, director of
athletics, speak of the greatest “kick” he experienced from an athletic
event.

It was not unusual that the man in the case is only a sophomore at
the University, nor that several of our sports teams overshadow swim-
ming, the sport in the story, nor that the hero loses a close race.

But VV, Don Harrison, chose one
quarter-mile race in the Metropolitan
pool between Dexter Vvoodford and Pat
‘Corr’s sensational sophomore free-
style swimmer, Tom Locke, one Sat-
urday in January, 1936. 'Woodford
rated plenty high when he was chosen
on Ed Kennedy's All-American swim-
ming team. In fact the entire Ohio
State team breezed in from Columbus
feeling plenty conﬁdent of returning
with a Panther pelt.

As it turned out, they got the pelt,
a.nd easily, but not before Mr. \7Vood-
ford was given the scare of his life.
Young Tommy Locke showed only
“novice” credentials, polished up a bit
with a C. D. Wettach award, to one of
the four best quarter-milers in the
country. Locke looked loose, gangling
and almost too frail for his ﬁrst start
in Intercollegiate competition.

At the gun, both swimmers shoved
off, Woodruft‘ getting a good start, but
at the half mark he could still see
Locke at his shoulders. Now this was
bad news to Mr. Woodford, but he ﬁg-
ured he would step up the “beat” and
soon shake his shadow.

With only a lap to go, his mad sprint drove him ahead, but still Locke
swam within striking distance, In that ﬁnal lap, the water ﬁzzed and
si-zzled with the machine-like “ﬂutter” kicks of both swimmers. It was
only a question of how much water remained to the ﬁnish wall. Wood-
ford sensed Locke moving up, but could do nothing about it.

Mr. Woodford could no longer step it up, and then there was only :1.
few yards to go. Woodford’s hand smacked the wall just then and it
was over. Locke lost, but had the race been 441-yards, he most certainly
would have out-touched the faltering All-American.

“That,” Mr. Harrison concluded, “takes real courage for :1. sophomore
in his ﬁrst Intercollegiate race. Locke, who is working his way through
the University, will go far,” he predicted.

All this comes from :3. man who has watched Pitt football elevens
battle the Irish, Nebraska, Southern California, Army, and other great
teams during his eight years in the guiding position of director of athletics
for Pitt teams.

Held By Athletes

Teachers’ Team To Roll Phi Delts
For University Bowling Title

Play in the second annual Univer-
sity Table Tennis Tourney begins to-

day, the ﬁfth hour, in Room 817, Ca-
thedral. A last-minute ﬂood of en-
tries poured in just before Friday’s 5
o’clock deadline, boosting the number
of competitors to well over 80'.
Pairing for today’s ﬁrst round play
are posted, on the ﬁrst ﬂoor bulletin
board in the Cathedral. An attempt
will be made to have all ﬁrst round
matches competed this afternoon and
there will be plenty of activity across
Room 817’s three tables.

Last year Irvin Solow, chairman
of this event, won the title by defeat-
ing Bill Brosius. Both men are back
this year, but the large number of
entries shows that at least 78 students
aren’t worrying about their return.

The gentlemen from the department
of athletics hold the ﬁrst place notch
in the Faculty Bowling League, which
swings back into action this evening
in the Strand Bowling Alleys.

Captained by James Potts, assistant
track coach, the athletic group has
won 20 games i11 24 starts. The teams
is composed of Potts, Milligan, Kern,
Hagen, Bowser, Olson, Ridley, and
O’Dell. Charley Bowser has an aver-
age of 131.8 pins to hold the individ-
ual leadership on this team.

In second place are the Vvildcats
with a record of 18 victories and 6
defeats, followed by the Printing, Bus-
iness Administration, Education, En-
gineers and History, tied for sixth
position, and the Administration
teams in that order.

Ted Biddle holds the record for a
high-game score with a neat 200 total.
Enright oi: the Wildcats has an aver-
age of 136.7 pins to head the individ-
ual scoring list.

Intramural League Games
Scheduled For Six Groups

\\'itl1 six leagues organized. two al-
ready running full blast. two answer-
ing the opening gong today and to-
morrow, and the remaining two card-
ed ‘(or inaugurals later in the week,
basketball rules the University sports’
roost.

Nothing seems to upset the equi-
librium of Greek athletic chairman,
Bill Housel, and as  result the two
Interfrateruity Leagues have com-
pleted all opening games.

First night honors in Interi'rater-
nity‘s League A went to Theta Chi,
Kappa Sigma, and Phi Kappa. A ﬁrst-
half scoring splurge put the game on;
ice for the Theta Cl1is_ although
Sigma Chi limited them to four points
during the ﬁnal period only to lose,

25-‘.22.

Defending champions, Kappa Sigma.
showed that they had lost none of
their championship touch. With
Johnny \Vood in the leading point-
making role, they walloped Phi Ep-
silon Pi, 54-21. Phi Kappa. put the
Indian sign on the Lambda Chis, 23-
11. in the remaining Tuesday game.

Competition in League B started
\Vednesday evening. Winners. a.nd as
a result league-leaders, were Phi
Gamma Delta, Delta Tau Delta, and
Phi Delta Theta.

Bill l\/Iurchison paced the Phi Gams
to a 20-10 win over Pi Kappa Alpha.
The leading scoring light in the Phi
Delt 31-13 licking to Sigma Alpha. Mu
was burly footballer Bill Glassford.
Last ’year’s runner-up, Delta Tau
Delta, gave evidence that it, too,
would be very much in the running
by schellaking the Pi Lams, 36-5.

All this sent the Interfraternity
leagues off to a. streamlined start on
a streaxnlincd track. 'l‘onight the In-
dependents have their say. Chi Rho
Nu stacks up against the Newman
Club at 8 o’clock on the Trees Gym-
nasium floor in the initial Independ-
ent League encounter.

Fol‘owing 0 this fray, Kappa Alpha
Phi meets the Sophties at 9 o’clock.
Other members of this league are .1163

Edgewood and the Chem Specials.

wc._v. Electricals
vs. Chem Eiigixieers, Chem Specials

These games involve the entire league
members iip.

Although ()l‘gO.l‘IlZ€(l, the Medical
School League aml the Dental School
League will not start play until the
latter part of the week. Ahoys, Littlo
Potatoes, Yes Men. Rul1csers,and

Each organization has an annual
extravanganza; the Cabaret and the
Cap and Gown show. This year’s Cab-
aret, adapted from the Gilbert and

Sullivan operetta “H. M. S. Pina-
fore,” will be known as “H. M. S.
Pittafore.”

Cap and Gown employs a goodly

number of men. Some “men are men,”
but many burlesque as bits of fem-
ininity. Similarly, only one of the
women who will appear in “Pittafore”
will take feminine part. The remaind-
er of the VVAA’ers will have just as
much trouble making up as swarthy
sailors as the huskies will have in
decking themselves out as members
of the gentler sex.

With an SFA committee ready to
meet any demand of the general stu-
dent body, possibly the two groups
could get together and put through a
motion for a. new “exchange” commit-
tee where women could trade their
four triple A sized feet for a pair
of broad shoulders. or where the
feminine lead in, C&G could trade oﬁ
his stubble for the real McCoy in
blonde tresses.

Kappa Phi Dinner Meeting
Scheduled For Tomorrow

Kappa Phi, organization of Metho-
dist students from the University,
Carnegie Tech, Frick Training School,
and Duquesne will meet at 5:30

Student Bridge Club
To Hold Eliminations

Faculty Strengthened, Says Labarthe;
Students Don’t Lose Two In Row

In preparation for the student-facul-
ty bridge tournament Thursday, the

Student Bridge Club will hold a du-
plicate tournament tomorrow at 2:30
o’clock in Room 801, Cathedral, to
choose a team of 24 members, and six
alternates.

There will be at least 12 openings
for bridge players who did not com-
pete in the last faculty match, but
Leonard Seder, C37, president, stated
that all prospective contestants must
be present at the meeting tomorrow
to be eligible.

The match Thursday evening will
be held in the rooms of the Faculty
Club, 17th ﬂoor, Cathedral,.and will
begin at 8 o’clock. According to Dr.
Jules Labarthe, senior fellow of Mel-
lon Institute, acting captain of the
-faculty team and leading scorer in
the latest tournament, the faculty
team has been strengthened consider-
ably by the acquisition of several new
players. Yet the precedent shows
that the student team has never lost
two matches _in a row. “A hot ﬁght
is expected.” The team losing this
match must stand the expense of pay-
ing the tournament director for the
next match.

mittee today in Room 119, Alumni
Hall, at 12:30 o’clock. All members
are asked to be present.
