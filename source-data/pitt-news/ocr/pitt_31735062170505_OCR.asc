President Nixon has won land-
slide re-election by earring 49 of
the 50 states, but despite his tri-
umph the Democrats kept firmly
in control of Congress.

Only Massachusetts and the
District of Columbia withstood
the Nixon tide Tuesday and wound
up in Democrat George McGov-
ern.’s almost invisible column.

_ Nixon’s I521-17 electoral vote
_majority over McGovern rivaled
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1936 vic-
tory of 3523 to eight over Alf Lan-
don. The Republican President,
scoring his greatest personal tri-
nmph won about 61 per cent of the
 popular vote, matching Lyndon B.
'9 Johnson's 61.1 per cent eight
 -years ago.

 But the Democrats picked up a
-net of two seats in the Senate to
widen their control there to 57 to
43, gained a net of one governship
‘-and lost only about a dozen seats

WASHINGTON—President Nix-
on, wasting "scant time on cele-
bration, scheduled three meetings
with key aides and officials today
to look toward the next four years.
Nixon set up sessions with mem-
bers of the White House staff, the
Cabinet and heads of federal agen-
cies.

Nixon returned to the White
House about 1 a.m. today after
attending formal GOP victory
celebrations in a Washington ho-
tel, then went immediately to his
office in the ‘Executive Office
Building next door. Ziegler said
the President wanted to return
some of the phone calls he had re-
ceived from prominent well-wish-
ers.

SIOUX FALLS, S. D. — George
McGovern’s long day’s journey

odyssey that had started 22
months and 300,000 miles before.
As usual, he was composed in de-
feat.

“Congratulations on your vic-
tory,”
Nixon in a telegram his support-
ers had long dreaded hearing. “I
hope in the next four years you
will lead us to a time of peace
abroad and justice at home. You
have my full support in such ef-

Oil Co. Charged  t

by MIKE MILLER

A group of “concerned stu-
dents“ made an abortive attempt
to confront a recruiter from the
Gulf Oil Company at the Place-
ment Office on Monday. The stu-
dents wanted to challenge the re-
cruiter with charges of genocide
in Portuguese Angola for which
they felt Gulf is responsible.

Bill Morrison of the SDS said

- that “Gulf Oil has been condemn-

City Police Search Room in Towers

Last Thursday night, Pittsburgh
City Police, with a search war-
rant, entered a room in Tower B.
There were no arrests. The pre-

and the Campus Police were both
notified. -

According to Redick, the inci-
dent was a rare case of city police
intervening in student affairs. He
said, , "I’d say that, so far this
year, there have been only two or
three incidents where the city po-
lice have come on campus."

sistance to colonial powers which
are engaged in suppressing na-
tional liberation movements.’ ’

Morrison also claimed that Gulf
spends 50 million dollars main-
taining a 15,000 man mercenary
army in Angola.

Assistant Dean of Student Af-
fairs William Markus attempted

~ to ease the tension on,Monday by

talking to the students.

“I think these folks had a right
to be here,” Markus said. “They
made a peaceable presentation of
a point of view in which they
strongly believe. I'm here to in-
sure the rights of all concerned,
the recruiter, the people being in-
terviewed and these students.”

Morrison continued to maintain
that the recruiter had no right to
be on campus.

‘‘That’s like saying a person
selling drugs has a right to do it.
Gulf is a worse pusher. They‘re
pushing murder,” he said. .

He also alleged that “this Uni-
versity is not a neutral institu-
tion.” He said that Pitt is con-
trolled by the Mellon family

through University investments in I ll‘

Gulf, Alcoa, Pittsburgh Plate

Glass, Mellon Bank, and other 7

Mellon owned corporations.

Markus said that the recruiter
had refused the confrontation be-

cause of a tight interview sched- , 
ule and because he had been in- - 
structed by his superiors not to 

make policy statements.

Markus did not comment on the A 4'7;
students’ charges or on the pre-

sence of Campus Police Inspec-
tor Brevard, who was present in
the Placement Office.

The sltudent group consisted of l

members of the SDS, the-_Student
Mobilization Committee, and stu- .
dents who had attended a SDS ral-

ly on Gulf Oil's actions in Portu- ,' 

guese Angola.

At the SDS meeting Monday, 
members of the Gulf Oil Protest. : 
Committee vowed to confront the V 

Gulf recruiter with a larger‘
crowd during his next visit to the

Placement Center. Plans are also  I
being made for the publication of _"

"06 Ygdn_0f Collegiate Journalism”

lllllllllllllllllllllllll:

by JOHN METCALFE

A few issues ago, while discussing the diffi-
culties nonresident students experience getting to
and from the University. I mentioned hitchhiking.
While hitching is cheaper and sometimes quicker
than the local bus system, it does not work every
time or for every hitchhiker.

No doubt the general poor condition of the
world is a factor in this lamentable development.
Drivers may be unwilling to take a chance on
some stranger who probably does not carry a string
of letters of reference in his-jeans. Just the jeans
may put some potential benefactors off.

But a large factor has to be the hitchers them-
selves..’I‘hey do not seem to know what they are
doing.

An especially large group seems to imagine

that it is possible to successfully combine hitchhik-

ing with walking. It is not.

The most likely result of this experiment is that
the traveller will arrive very late at his destination,
weary and cramped from walking the entire dis-
tance backward.

Hitchhikers_would,do well to consider the needs
and interests of drivers, many of whomare human
beings like themselves. Only drivers overcome by
kindness or by a vague flirtation with death will
risk their‘lives just to pick up’ a fellow-traveller.
In my hitching experience, drivers who will, for
instance, stop dead in a moving lane of city" traf-

' fic, are likely to expose me to similar dangers once

I am in the front seat. Many of them drive very
fast when they get a chance; some of them choose
to ignore those few traffic regulations which make
clear practical sense; a few are obvious suicides
who wish to share their final choice with some

A Column and a Half

ll||l|lllI||ll||l||llllllE

For thumbers who wish to improve their chances
of arriving quickly wherever they are going as
well as to attract a less exciting sort of driver. I
have a few suggestions.

The first is obvious, but here goes. Give your
benefactor a place to stop. Choose a place where it
is possible to pull out of the stream of traffic. No
Parking areas are handy, as are bus-stops.

Make yourself visible from a reasonable dis-
tance. In other words, don’t lurk just around a
sharp curve, or between parked cars. However
kindly disposed a driver may be, if he does not
see you until he passes you he is most unlikely
to back up or to circle the block just for the
privilege of your company.

Do not walk or stand directly in front of on-
coming traffic. This isllikely to annoy peopleywho
might otherwise have wished to pick you up.
Some of them may even hit you. It is also
illegal. The latest version I have of the state
Vehicle Code states, roughly, that “No person
shall stand on the main travelled portion of a
street or highway for the purpose of solicit-
ing a ride.” Yes, you may be arrested. By current
custom, if you are under eighteen you will be
released from custody only to your parents, as
you will be considered a probable runaway.

I have hitchhiked about thirty thousand miles
in this country and roughly the same distance all
over Europe——not all in one trip. In those miles I
have seen hitchhikers ignore all of the above
suggestions. Sometimes, days later, I have met
them when they finally straggled into their des-

; tination, complete with stories of how hard it was

to get a ride_this time out.

When I drive I always pick up hitchhikers-
like repaying a debt—if they let me. i

Letters to the Editor

’I‘o the Editors of the Pitt News:

I am constantly amazed that
not only do Pitt students allow
the humourless ‘Homecoming
Queen Contest’ to go on, but some
of them actually vote in it (is
apathy dead?) I figured that by

~ now, manylmore of them would

have developed some sensitivity
to women’s consciousness .(if
you don’t know what that isfyou

don’t have it.) This letter has ref-"

erence to the non-exploitation of
women, particularly in the case
of the Homecoming Queen Farce.

Many liberationists have com-.
pared these beauty contests where
women parade around and allow
others to compare their physical
attributes; i.e., proportioning of
meat, to cattle shows where cows

parade around and allow others to '

compare their physical attri-

butes, i.e., proportioning of meat. '*

It is my contention that in
marching human females back
and forth for show is just sublim-
ating real desires in a socially
accepted manner. I therefore pro-
pose that we do away with all the
superficialities and half-admit-
ted truths of the Homecoming
Queen Farce not by eliminating
the contest, but by giving the cus-
tomer what he really wants. Bare
skin and nitty gritty.’ No one is
really interested in personality
and personal achievements in
beauty contests so let’s do away
with that "as well. Very few

' cows I’ve met have congenial per-

sonalities (I’ve never had an in-
teresting conversation with one)
or have accomplished much of
note. My proposal is that we hold
a cattle show (not to be confused
with the panther show that takes
place Saturday afternoons.) No
longer will you men have to guess,
and dream about those bumps
under the sweaters or the well-
formed ‘scoops of vanilla ice
cream‘ or ‘scoops of chocolate ice
cream‘ peeking out from the top
half of the bikini. In our cattle
show, we’ll let it all hang out.

have two, but cows have four! .

Dear Sir:

Nowhere has the serial Repub-
lican apologia in the Pitt News
fallen flatter on its face than in
Wednesday’s piece on Nixonomics
by Alstadt and Haley.

Ignoring Nixon’s obvious panic
when his deliberate policy of un-
employment, high interest rates,

etc, failed and Democratic pres— .

sure forced him to try wage and
price controls, A & H’s selected
three points, with the necessary
translation, make the case for
McGovern:

1) for ‘(more flexible controls”.
read granting an average 9 out
of 10 price increases while re-
peatedly battling Labor on wage
increases;

2) to “stimulate expansion” add
“of joblessness” (an additional
2 million unemployed under Nix-
on, so far, at an estimated cost to
the taxpayer of $55 billion);

3) suspension of convertibility
of the dollar into gold was a
move, again made in despera-
tion, as Nixon saw the world real-
izing that he was NOT‘ control-
ling US inflation, which botches
up financial conditions around
the globe; and as this nation mov-
ed into the worst foreign trade
situation in this‘ century! (Good
reasonsto soften one’s ideology
towards big world traders nam-
ed Russia, China and Japan)

Under the circumstances, Nixon’s
decision to allow the dollar to be
devalued was a correct one; the
point is, that it needn’t have been
that way. Furthermore, the 10

‘percent surcharge on imports,

an ,adj'u'stment overkill, ‘was ‘typ-

' ical-_of_ short-sighted_ special inter-

est-oraieiited 1 ,Nixonomi<;s,. .~'I'_li_is_,.

by the dubious theory that hiking
import prices would somehow
stimulate an underproductive
economy, was matched’ with the
hard reality that higher import
prices only add to the consumer’s
inflationary burden.

Anyone who has survived a
freshman-level ‘statistics course
can see what Alstadt and Haley
were doing with their industrial

.?\

production and personal income '

figures. They used a monthly
rate (September, usually a good
month) in the former. and a
yearly rate for the latter. The
personal income‘ figure is not

, explained in terms of whether or

not inflation was accounted for
(“real” income) _as was done
in the spending power figure-
which is disputed by Labor, any-
way. Also, had A & H used the
monthly rate for inflation for
the last month and extrapolated
that into a yearly average, as a
government report two weeks ago
did, it would have come out to
6 percent—the rate when Nixon
took office. 1'

/

More deceptive perhaps, was

. theimplication that the_nonfarm

production workers category of
employment reflects the “aver-
age worker’s”l take—home pay
situation. Come now, gentlemen!
We all know that that is the most
highly unionized sector of the
workforce. Omitted are most non-
union workers, white collar work-
the self-employed, C etc.,
namely all of those who suffer
most from Nixon’s policies.

McGovern’s program, aside
from dropping the politically hot .
though economically sound $1,-
000 -a-person negative income tax

_,proposal, has been onenot so

much of change, in the sense
of policy reversal (like Nixon)
but of growth—and all in the same
direction: redistribution of wealth,
and jobs. The expenses are clearly
covered by McGovern’s new
revenue~ proposals. As for Mc-
Go,ve_r'n’s’Se'nate record on econo-
mic bills, someone really ought to

housework or holding a pencil. The old arts of leather-working. can-
dle-making. knitting, and silver-smithing were being taken up by or-
dinary people in rebellion against the selfless, mass-produced, depart-
ment store goods of our age.

The Earthworks Exchange. located in a yellow brick, three-story
building on Craig St., in Oakland, is a testimonial to the living-on of
handcraft, but is the only such experiment in Pittsburgh.

Sue Berger, who runs the Exchange, described it as “Pittsburgh’s
only market for individual craftsmen.” The quality of the items, and
the prices, make one wonder why.

Handmade shirts and afghans, a whole wall of brightly colored knit
handbags, a rack of wide, real leather belts, shelves of rugs, a glass
case with delicately wrought jewelry all strike the eye as you enter
the second floor display room. Touching the items reveals a texture
and honesty in the materials that somewhere along the way manu-
facturers seem to have lost. And yet, the prices for the goods are
lower than those on the commercial market. -

Burger explained that the individual craftsmen set their own
prices. The arrangement is by consignment; if a craftsman comes in
with something he or she would like to sell, the item is displayed at
the Exchange. When the item is sold, the Exchange gets a certain per-
centage and the remainder of the price goes to the craftsman.

, Most of the 85 local craftsmen currently displaying work do their
particular handcraft as a hobby. Burger pointed out that many use the
money they make, for supplies so they can continue their work. Be-
sides items on display, the Exchange has contact with craftsmen who
make special items—jewels, bridal veils—to order.

“The Exchange is always open to new people who want to display
their craft, as long as the quality is good," said Burger. College stu-
dents bearing crafts are welcome.

Earthworks Exchange plans to open a yarn shop and an art gallery
in the near future. Also, one of the second story rooms is now filled
with things for the Christmas season—sma1l cloth birds and colored
glass bulbs for tree decorating, candles, and children’s dolls. As I was
leaving, Burger smiled and reminded me to bring my Christmas list
by. I think I will.

Ceylon Seminar Offered

by JUDY DECKER

A new three credit seminar
course. Project Srilanka (Ceylon),
is being offered Winter Term for
students interested in examining
the society and culture of Ceylon.
Nine or 10 students will be select-
ed from the enrolled participants

to visit Srilanka for an eight to 12

week trip in late April.

The course is open to under-
graduates with more than 30
credits who are willing to return
to Pitt, and help work with and
share their experiences with the
next term’s class.

Gary Lowe of the International
Student Services stated that this
course is “student oriented”;
anyone interested in enrolling
should contact him at 1105 Bruce
Hall, ext. 6180, for a course card.

Sinhalese, which is the nation-
al language, will be taught, though
English is also spoken on the is-
land. History and geography will
also be discussed. with emphasis
on the last 20 years of the coun-
try’s history, during which time
Srilenka became a socialist coun-
try. Buddhism remains the pre-
dominant religion.

Hopefully, the students involved
in the trip to Srilanka will be able
to stay with host families for at
least the first three-four weeks in
the capital city of Columbo.

They will be expected to per-
form some research effort while

terests. Participation in a work-
study program will also be avail-
able. All projects will be carried
out on a “people to people” basis,
allowing the students to interact
with an Eastern-Asian culture. A
student contribution of $200 will
be required for the trip.

The participants in the trip will
be prepared in several ways to
minimize the Western-Eastern cul-
ture shock. Indian food, highly
spiced, will be introduced to the
students. The trip from Pitts-
burgh to Asia will be made with
stops at various places in the East
to slowly expose the students to
the new culture. A four day train
trip from northern to southern In-
dia is also being considered to sen-
sitize the students to Eastern
peoples.

This new course, designed to
add an international dimension to
the University, owes its existence
to the success of its predecessor,
Project Afghanistan, which is

also being offered this term.

The course is funded by the Bu-
reau of Education in Cultural Af-
fairs of the U.S. Department of
State.

Burning PlZZCl Starts Series of Dorm Flcimes

by LARRY PANSINO

Last Thursday night a pair of
fires broke out in Tower B, Room
602. According to a police report,
a call was made to the local fire
department at 11:46 p.m. from
residents of that dormitory’s 22nd
floor, where smoke from the fire
had accumulated after drifting up
the stairwells. After searching
several floors, firemen discover-
ed the room from which the
smoke eminated.

A campus policeman admitted

the firemen to the room, appare-
ently with a master key; they
found the contents of a waste bas-
ket smoldering and quickly ex-
tinguished it.

The occupants of the room were
not present. Eyewitnesses said a
“burned pizza” discarded in the
waste can started the fire. By
shortly after midnight, the fire-
men had ventilated the room, and
its door was locked again. But the
evening's excitement was yet to
continue.

At 12:38 a.m., the fire depart-
ment was called again. Addition-
ally, residents activated several
fire alarms in Tower B. However,
students on the sixth floor did not
wait for help this time. Again
smoke poured from under the
door of Room 602; fearing that
someone may have been uncon-
scious inside the room, one of
those present .-kicked the door
open.

The students, found a burning
mattress, immediately broke out

dormitory fire extinguishers and
a hose, and doused the small blaze.
Firemen arrived there shortly af-
terwards. Apparently, this fire
was started by a hot plate, or
other electrical appliance, placed
underneath the bed, in contact
with the sheets.

Donovan Hughes, the Associate
Director of Housing, listed the
damages: the mattress, two
sheets, two pillows, two pillow
.cases, a bolster pad and the kick-
ed-in door, which must be re-
placed as a unit. Besides these
ruined articles, the bed itself and
areas of the floor and walls -211]
scorched—need repairing. Hugh-
es estimated the total damage as
“around $200 or $250” and said
the room’s occupants will be bill-

‘ ed. Hughes pointed out that elec-

trical appliances such as -hot
plates are expressly prohibited in
dormitory rooms by the housing
code and cites the violators as
libel.

Safety Officer, expressed concern
over residents who did not leave
the floor when asked to by fire-
men. “One of the things that dis-
turbed me was the failure of the
students to evacuate the dorm. A
student should not oppose a po-
liceman, fireman, or head resi-
dent when he says to evacuate a
floor." '

One of the observers at the fire
was the floor's resident assistant,

. Joel Hurwitz. He,substantiated

much of the police report and said
that no water damage to the floor
occurred because of the water
pumping equipment of the fire de-
partment.

In reference to Barry's concern,
Joel said, “Nobody left the Tow-
er. Some students left the floor
and just stood in the stairwells.
The campus police were able to
get some people away. It seems
that as long as the students see no
danger to themselves, they’ll
stand around and watch it like a
show." '

Coke to Cure
Alcoholism

COCA-COLA may be insidious-
»ly capitalistic in the eyes of
most communist country
governments, but the Polish
government views Coke as the
answer to a growing alcohol-
ism problem in that country."

The Polish government re-
cently asked Coca-Cola to sell
their product in that country
as a competitorgfor the large
teenage beer and vodka mar-

, ket. Pepsi-cola will also be sold
but as the official organ of the
Polish Communist Party ex-
plained, ‘‘It just doesn't taste
thesame.”

Revolutionary Dogma Mars “La

by STEVE LUBETSKY

All -- When I first picked up an issue of

National Lampoon, I beheld what
I considered a revolutionary ap-
proach to humor and heir appar-
ent to Mad Magazine. After buy-
ing two issues, I "became so ad-
dicted, I purchased a trial sub-
scription for one year, and even-
tually also paid $3 for the first
three copies I missed.

The material, admittedly, was
somewhat gross. Indeed, not the
strongest of stomachs could have
survived “The World's Seven

by BARBARA GERAUD

The first few times I heard
‘-‘You Don’t Mess Around with
Jim,” I figured Jim Croce was on
some sort of ego trip, writing a
song about himself. Then I found
out there really was a “Big Jim

’alker” that hung around the
mid ‘St.

" wasn’t going to mess around with
his songs—let him write what he
wanted. I

But I wouldn’t buy the album
(ABC x-756) until I heardhis fol-
low-up single, “Operator (That‘s
Not the Way, It Feels).” Deciding

', that if I liked two songs out of 12,

there was hope of liking the others.

And Ivido. This album contains
12 of the best songs I’ve ever
heard, beautiful in their lyricism
and simplicity. '

Croce wrote all the’ songs and

I sings them with only a modicum
of embellishment. His voice is
rﬁ-:.~gh and untrained, but he sings
each song as he wrote it—with

“'3 depth and sincerity.

As in “A Long Time Ago”: "We
spent the whole night talkin’/You
said you’d like to see the sunrise*
But in the fold of mornin’/was

nothing I had not seen in your‘

eyesf’

Or “I would reach ‘into heaven/
and I’d pull you down a star for a
present/and I’d make you a chain

Worst Restaurants."‘which pic-
tured the head and claw of a
dead chicken on top of a chicken
wing, and a rat-and-spider-web-
infested hamburger-french fry
plate, without turning.

The ideas, however, were quite
adventurous, which was Lam-
poon’s outstanding attraction.
“The Soviet Zone After Dark,”
which contained a sampling of
Warsaw, Poland’s TV alignment,
is one of the most exotic satires
I've ever read.

Cartooning combined insanity

.«.Truck Driver Sings

out of diamonds/and pearls from
a summer sea” from “Tomor-
row’s Gonna Be a Brighter Day.”

Then there’s the rocker, more
autobiographically workingman—

‘type songs—“Hard Time Losih’

Man” about alguy. who gets ripped
off for everything from a car held
together by wire and “a couple a’
hunks of twine” to. “just tryin‘ to

him a sawbuck for. /
'I‘here’s a song about “Rapid

Roy (the Stock Car Boy)" and one

about a young “down home coun-
try boy” who was “took” by a city

-lady. Songs about all facets of life
as Jim has apparently lived_them. ~

And if he’s lived a life'that‘s in
any slight way like most of these
songs, it’s been some life. ,It’s
worth listening to him sing about
it.

with innovation. “The Fruit Gum
Cycle," which appeared in the
Pollution edition, stands out as
the craziest animation I‘ve ever
seen in any publishing. To think
that a stick of fruit-stripe gum
could have such an impact on the
process of evolution.

As time went on, Lampoon pro-
gressed with it. Articles grew in
hilarity, topics in eccentricity. So
impressed was I, that I purchased
a three-year subscription when
my first one expired. I reasoned
that rather than saving only $3.05
for one year,.it would be more
profitable to save $12.50 for three
years. L

It turned. out not to be the bar-
gain I thought it would be. For
what used to be a revolutionary
approach to humor has become a
hideous approach to revolution.

Since slightly molrethan 12 is-
sues ago, the content of National
Lampoon has shifted to an em-
phasis on politics, and all that I
read in there now, it seems, is
Nixon, Nixon,, Nixon. There is
only so much laughter that can be
had from a gimmick carried too
far, and, furthermore, I can find
hardly anything funny about the
man to begin with.

In a recent issue is an article
concerning the .Coronation of
Richard Nixon, containing what is
referred to as “The Dick of

Rights,“ which poses the Presi- A

dent as a dictorial monarch. In-
asmuch as I myself dislike him, I
think that it’s one thing when sat-
ire is based on truth, but/when it
derives from falsities, it ceases
to be humorous, bu_t instead be-
comes propaganda.

The latest issue, which focuses
on the Fabulous Sixties, establish-

ed Lampoon now as being not only _

politically monotonous, but down-
right offensive as well. The ad
boasts that it features “Bob Dy-
Ian and Joan Baez in Zimmerman
Comics, Tom Wolfe in Watts, and
a long-suppressed Rolling Stones
album.”

All this sounds attractive, but
never is it revealed what is real-
ly inside the two covers: that the
sucker has to find out for him-
self. So upset was I while reading

‘it. I had a notion to sue for de-

ceptive advertising.
Included in these pages is one

item no one would ever expect to-

find in a humor magazine — the
murder of President Kennedy.
Yet National Lampoon knows no
boundaries, and dared to publish

Wednesday, November 8, l972—THE PITT NEWS—Page 

mpoon's" Humor

a cartoon story of the assassina-
tion of Vaughan Meter, who used
to impersonate President Kenne-
dy, and the inauguration of David
Frye, who has done impressions
of Lyndon Baines Johnson.

“The Ventures of Zimmerman”
portrays Bob Dylan as a hypocri-
tical split personality. As Dylan;
he is an idealistic folksinger-poet,
but as “Zimmerman,” he is de-

picted as profit-minded, money- —

swindling Jew, whom the Weath-

ermen refer to as “revanchist"
pig.” Perhaps “Zimmerman”

should show National Lampoon

what a pig he really is by filing a

law suit and donating proceeds to

the Anti-Defamation League.

Imitation Godot is like imitation

anything; it may have its good
points but there is an essence of
falseness to it. This is the basic
problem of student Tom For-
grave‘s play, Tomorrow, the cur-
rent Studio 'I'héatre production.

Forgrave, who__ also directed his

play, is simply no match at this
time in his career for Samuel
Beckett. He does display a talent
for clever dialogue which unfor-
tunately is often bogged down by
attempts at heavy-handed pro-
fundities.

The core of his play is a cruelly

witty parody on sexual games be-A

tween men and women. If" the
script had been -pared down to this
theme, it could easily have suc-

ceeded on its own merits. How-,

ever Forgrave’s insistence on

.tackling (with at least one line),

all the important universal ques-

V tions scatters that core.

It remained the task of the ac-

tors to recreate a whole from For--

farce. They just manage it.

The cast, consisting of two men
and two women, perform enough
quasi sexual acrobatics to keep us
thoroughly entertained. Clownlike
in a Three Stooges tradition, the
four actors alternately court and
castrate [one another. Amazing
discoveries are made like, “Girls
are humans“ in the course pt’ ro-
tating power struggles.

Ricky Ruben is Gene, a child-

ish, somewhat sloppy outcast that '

no one wants. While his carica-
ture is slightly strained in the be-

ginning of the play, he soon re-

laxes into. an" appropriate ‘and
charming simplicity. J. J. Tierney
as Alfred, the man the two wom-
en both want, is an apt study in
adolescent sexual». anxiety. Like

every; good 13 year old, he doesn’t ,

know. what all this frustration
means, and handsgclutching his
crotch, he repeats, »“I’m hungry,
I'm hungry." '-

Iliad _all year, there’s nodoubt

phq, by-JANICE BUCCIGROSSI , _ _
- Associate sports Editor about that,’ commented the Pitt
‘- gridder. —

x _
 It’s a little difficult to find
something good :_ about a 1-8
football record, but the perform-
ance of the Panthers’ junior‘ half-
back Bill Englert has been one
of the few bright spots of Pitt's
‘72 season. '

This perfmroance was a cul-
mination of ‘Englert’s season-
long efforts to capture a starting
spot on the squad and keep it.

“I guess the biggest~thrill of
the year for me is winning a
starting assignment,” said Eng-
lert. “At the very beginning of
the season I wanted to be first
string. I'm pretty consistent and
I —think that’s ‘why I’m play-

, ing.”
If _Englert is pleased with his
performance so far this season.
the team’s showing has not been
anything like he expected.

"Except for about threeteams,
we got beaten by teams that
weren't better than us, last
year," he stated. "We thought
we would come back this year.
though. Everyone came to camp
knowing that we would be play-
ing some good teams but we‘
knew we couldn‘t afford to be
beaten by teams that weren't
be han us. ‘ 5

Englert has been progressing
all season and his outstanding
showing last weekend against
the West Virginia Mountaineers
enabled him to become the sec-
ond Panther to gain over‘ 100
yards rushing this year.

Against West Virginia ' Englert
rushed for a ,'se_as_0n high of, 114
yards on'17 carries.

“I feel that Bill had an,excep-
3, tionally fine day on Saturday,”
related Pitt’s head football coach
‘Carl DePasqua. “He was the
second man to gain over 100
yards and this seems to show that
we’re establishing some poise
and confidence in ‘what we are
doing.

“It was the best performance

for their activities offthe ice, are
working together very smoothly
with Clarke fitting right in even
though it‘s only his first season
with Glanville and Browne.

The second line is also impres-
sive with Tom Lang and Frank
Williams on the wings and Dave
Bahnson at center. Williams, who
has been hampered with knee
problems, has missed the last two
weeks of practice but is expected
to skate with the team this week.
Williams was the leading scorer
on the squad last year.

Meyers and Carole have not yet
announced a starting third line
for the game and will not do so
until after the Thursday night
practice. Veterans Rick Baginski.
and
Jeff Leston have the best shots
at the open spots but are being
battled by ‘rookies Al Moidel
and Gary Cummings. ’

Mark Lieberman will start in
goal for Pitt and he should re-
member last year’s game with St.

' Vincent very well, as Pitt could

manage only a 2-1 win. Last
season’s contest with St. Vincents
was the first after the Christmas
holiday break and the icers went
into the contest after nothaving
practiced for three weeks.

Len Hoenfield led St. Vincents
in scoring last year with _three
goals and eight assists "with Rick
Ruddy second, scoring six goals
and two assists. Andy‘ Labrasca
will take the nets against Pitt.

can’t feel too bad about it.”

During the ‘72 campaign Eng-
lert feelsthat the only teams
that were really superior
ability to the Panthers were Air
Force and N otre Dame.

"Air Force and Notre Dame
were the only squads that were
better than our team this year.”
said Englert. “But even at Notre
Dame we stepped up to the
occasion and played well (the
Panthers successfully contain-

ed ND until the fourth quarter_

when the Irish
broke open the
gamei."

Englert’s for-
mula for suc-
cess against the
Midshipmen of
Navy on Satur-
day is short and
to the point.

“If we play well. well win."
explained Englert.

"But this

ENGLERTI

is something that‘

the Panthers have not been able ,

to do consistently and Englert
realizes it.

“We haven’t done that all
year,” related the 6-2, 195 pound
halfback. A“We’ve been giving
the ball away as well as giving
up our own opportunities to
score. It’s just been a series of
mistakes.”

Despite these mistakes and _'
the Panthers‘ disappointing sea-
son record. Englerg maintains
that the spirit on the Pitt team
is still high.

"Maybe some of the pressure
is off right now," he said. “But
we still don't want to be 1-10 at
the end of the season. We still
want to win those remaining
games.‘,' 1 " ., -.

Boo!-— But Nobody Is Really Scored  

by VINCE DiNARDO
Sports Editor

For the last 59 years. Boo Con-
nors has lived a part of the many
traditions that have become Pitts-
burgh history. Connors has been
a living part of the Hilly City,
the Smokey City, the rebirth of

the Golden Triangle.

Actually, Boo Connors has
played a very small role in the
history of Pittsburgh——he has been
a common day-to-day citizen.

But, in the Pitt family of athlet-
ics, Boo deserves the highest ac-
claim possible for his loyaa ser-
vice.

He has not been athletic di-
rector. he has not coached a Pitt
team to any Bowl Games. he
won’t ever be the man directly
responsible for any turn for the
better the Pitt athletic teams will
make. But, for the last 17 years,
Boo has served as the unlikely
mother to Pitt athletes.

As head of the equipment
department, B00 is responsible
for getting everything needed
on away football trips ready for
travel. He has to make sure that
if something breaks out in Colo-
rado Srpings, Colorado he has
to be able to fix it. It is his re-

sponsibility to see that the Pitt-

football team has clean clothes
every day. His experience ne-
gates mistakes.

A graying man. with a heal-
thy belly hanging over his brown
belt, Boo sends no fear into the

hearts of the Pitt athlete. He is.

When you say Boo Connors, no-
body is scared.

Quite to the contrary. Boo has
emassed a lot of friends in the
Pittsburgh area through the
_vears. Some people contend that
he knows everybody worth know-
ing. He knows all the cops. he
knows all the politicians. he knows
all the athletes.

“Boo has a magnetic person-
ality,” said Pitt head football
coach, Carl DePasqua. “He is a
friend of the squad; he is a friend
to city hall; he is a friend to
the mayor; he is a friend of the
Pirates; he is a friend of the
Steelers. He is the little mayor
of Pittsburgh.”

With proper apologies to Peter

I Flaherty, Boo might be deserv-

ing of that title.

“You know why DePasqua

‘called me that," he said when

this title was brought to his at-
tention. "This is why."

He reached for his desk in
Pitt Stadium and pulled up a
handful of parking tickets that
the football players" somehow
managed to get. Can Flaherty
fix parking tickets?

ReGeHing Set 6

by BART MACK

The Indiana (Pa.) soccer team
may not be the toughest compe-
tition that the Pitt booters will
face this season. but the game
this Saturday will definitely be an
important one for Pitt. If the boot-
ers can defeat Indiana they will
clinch the West Penn Conference
title for the third year in a row.

The booters are currently un-
defeated in league play and lead
second place Alliance only be-
cause Alliance has been tied once
in conference competition. The
booters will defend their title suc-
cessfully by virtue of the best
winning percentage in the league
if they can down Indiana. 1

Indiana has been finishing the
season strongly with victories in
three of the last four games
they’ve played. They recently tied
Slippery Rock, 1-1.

The game has definitely been

scheduled for Saturday at 2:45 '

p.m. Originally slated for an ear-
lier opening kickoff, the game con-
flicted with the local high school

' football playoffs, which were also

scheduled for Pitt Stadium on Sat-
urday.

-P'*~Although Pitt has had some

trouble with some top notch teams

this season. they have handled.
their West Penn opponents quite

easily. Pitt has recorded victories

over Carnegie-Mellon, Grove City,

Edinboro, and Slippery Rock in

league play.

Goalie Bill Haines, who will
start against Indiana, has notched
shutouts over Carnegie-Mellon
and Edinboro. boasts a 1.2 goals

against average in nine games so

(Continued from Page 9)

The varsity will play a 26
game schedule this year, with 13
home games, not counting the
Steel Bowl. One of the high-
lights of the road card is trip
out west, where the Panthers will
do battle with the UCLA Bruins
and Pepperdine College.

 

 

far this season. Freshman net-
minder Eric Holt. who held Grove
City to a single tally in his only full
appearance. will be available to
back up Haines.

The Pitt offense has out scored

their opponents 20 to 11 but the-

forward line has run into some
problems this year. Pitt has been
shutout three times this season,
while blanking the opposition
three times also.

Out of those 20 goals. senior
Joe Luxbacher has accounted for
11 himself as he leads the team in
scoring. Ray Rex and Denny Kohl-
meyer also have three goals
apiece.

The Pitt defense has been the
strong point of the team all sea-

son. providing Haines with excel-
lent protection. Led by Kohlmey-
er. Fernando Carriquiry. and
Dave Thompson. the fullback
crew has presented a strong show-
ing all season long.

A junior varsity contest has
also been scheduled for Saturday
and is presently slated to start at
lp.m. on the Trees Hall field.

Coach Leo Bemis realized the
importance of the crucial contest
when he said. “Indiana is a team
that‘s finishing the season pretty
good. 'I‘hey’ve beaten a couple of
good teams in our conference.

“I'm sure they‘ll be up for the
game." Bemis added. "It'll be a
big one for them too.‘.‘

NSA speaks your language

And furthermore, if you a.re especially adept
in. certain foreign languages, the National
Security Agency is ready to give you
immediate language assignments, advanced,
refresher, or special vocabulary training or
may even train you in an entirely new-
language.

Career language positions are available in the
fields of translation, transcription, analysis
and documentation. Fluency in speakingis not
essential, but knowledge of idiomatic,
colloquial and dialectal variations is desirable.

At NSA you will be joining an Agency of
national prominence——a unique civilian
organization responsible for developing
”secure” communications systems to transmit
and receive vital information.

NSA offers you this opportunity to further
broaden your knowledge of modern language
or area studies, and to use your talents in a
challenging and rewarding career while you
enjoy also the broad, liberal benefits of Federal
employment. In return, we ask that you not
only know your language, but that you be
ﬂexible, naturally inventive and intellectually
curious. That's a lot to ask.

. Do you fit the picture?

Where to go . . . what to do: Language
applicants ;n_1;§t take the Professional
Qualification Test (PQT) as a prerequisite to

2 NSA interviews for employment. Pick up a
PQT Bulletin at your Placement Office, the
sooner the better. It contains a brief
registration form which must be received in

' Berkeley, California by November 28 for
the December 9 test.
