Pitt students encourage support of
gay rights as they march on Washington

By Thanita Adams
Staff Writer

On April 25, an estimated one million
people will march in Washington, D.C.,
in support of gay, lesbian and bisexual
rights.

Among those participating in the 1993
March on Washington for Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Rights will be Sacha Layos,
co-president of the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance (BIGALA) at Pitt.

“I know it will be the most incredible
experience of my life to see so many
people who are either gay or bisexual or
who support me in my endeavors,”
Layos said. “I have an identity and I will
be able to see it out there. This will
make me more confident in my everyday
life.”

This will be the third march on
Washington. The first was in 1979 and
the second was in 1987 when approxi-
mately 600,000 Americans participated.

Layos attributed the growth of the
march to the current political atmos-

- phere in the United States.
“There is finally someone in office

who supports equal rights. for gays, les-
bians and bisexuals. [We] worked so
hard to get Clinton into office and we
want to make sure the Federal Civil
Rights Bill will be passed, that it will not
be delayed or put off.”

Layos also said that the march has
grown because of the committees that
have been organizing and promoting the
demonstration. There is at least one
committee office in every state.

According to Layos, one of the goals
of the march is to let people know that
gays, lesbians and bisexuals do exist in
large numbers, that they are not a few
isolated individuals scattered throughout
the United States.

f‘The march will be a coming out of
the closet in a big way,” Layos said. “It
will be very empowering to know that
there are so many people willing to risk
exposure, even arrest, to fight for our
equal rights.” I

The whole week surrounding the day
of the march will be full of activities
including fund raisers, dances,_dinners
and concerts. This gathering will also
serve to raise awareness and help orga-

nize for the future, Layos said.

“New organizations will be formed
during this time that will serve to fight
discrimination at the state and local lev—
els.”

Many other Pitt students will be
attending the march, including Todd
Kinavey, a senior and the business man-
ager for BiGALA. He is going for “politi-

cal reasons and personal empower-

ment.”

Both Kinavey and Layos said thatthey
feel it is very important for people to
actively show their support for gay
rights. _

“It is crucial for us as individuals to
show our faces, to say ‘here we are’ and
demand our basic rights,” Layos said

Inan effort to raise public awareness
for the march, Network Q, a gay televi-
sion network, is travelling across the
United States and holding rallies in vari-
ous cities. Pittsburgh will be Network
Q’s last stop before Washington, D.C.,

and a rally, co-sponsored by BiGALA, is

scheduled for Wednesday, April 21, on
the east lawn of the William Pitt Union.

Awards take two Pitt
students to Cornell

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

Two friends wanted to receive the same scholarship to attend the
same graduate school. Competitive tension could have escalated,
but never had a chance to.

Kathryn Heagy and Margaret Weitekamp both have received
Mellon Fellowship awards, and both have been accepted into
Cornell’s graduate school programs. ,

“I was surprised to see two of the fellowship awards go to two
Pitt students,” Weitekamp said.

The fellowship was granted to 89 students, and the winners were
selected from over 1,100 nominees across the country. The fellow-
ship is for college seniors and recent graduates of academic excel-
lence.

It covers full graduate tuition and fees but also covers a stipend
of $12,500 for the 1995-’94 academic year.

- Since 1985 there have been five Pitt students who have received
this award. Dean Alec Stewart of Pitt’s Honors College said the uni-
versity takes great pride in both Heagy and Weitekamp.

Heagy, a Pitt graduate with a degree in Japanese literature, was
offered a fellowship award from Cornell, but says she chose the
Andrew Mellon award. .

“I believe it was a case of prestige over economics, and it will be
nice to write Andrew Mellon on applications for awards in the
future,f’ Heagy said. ‘

Heagy said she hopes to spend time in Japan in the future, and
Cornell has told her she will have a one-year opportunity to study
abroad. '

Weitekamp, who will be graduating with a history degree this
year, said she remembers visiting Cornell with Heagy before they
realized how it would work out for the two of them.-_

Weitekamp is interested in writing and researching as well as
teaching on an undergraduate level.

“We became friends four years ago and now we are making
graduate school plans together,” Weitekamp said.

Heagy and Weitekamp have planned to be roommates at Cornell

GPSA holds strong against fees

By Pete Oppelt
Staff Writer

After squabbling for months with the
University of Pittsburgh administration over
gaining exemption from the $30 shuttle
bus/security fee, graduate student leaders
show no signs of rescinding their demands.

Graduate and Professional Student
Association President Steve Parks said that
he still does not want graduate students to
pay ‘the fee and that his organization’s “ulti-
mate goal is to get all fees under a line—item
veto system except the computer fee and
the activity fee.”

A line-item veto rule would allow stu-

, dents to pay only for those extra fees that

they choose.

Recently, the GPSA sent a report outlining
their concerns about the $30 fee to mem-
bers of the administration and are currently
awaiting a reply.

The report questioned the shutt1e’s role as
a security measure, as said by the adminis-
tration, since statistics show that its peak
ridership times are during low—crime day-
light hours and not at night when the crime
rate increases.

Statistics also reveal that a small percent-
age of graduate students ride the shuttle. In
addition, the report stated that the GPSA
wants the fee declared a tuition increase

since it “masks the real costs of a Pitt edu-
cation.” A

In order to accommodate more students,
including graduate students, shuttle routes
have been altered to include parts of-
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. Director of
Business and Finance John DeVitto said that
the new routes have increased the number
of graduate students riding the shuttle.

DeVitto added that his office has tried its
best to please the GPSA.

‘‘\We’ve done everything that they have
asked,” he said. “I’m a little dismayed since
all the things [in the GPSA report] were dis-
cussed with them.”

Additionally, money from the $30 fee will
be used to fund the current program to
increase lighting around campus and an
escort service that is in the planning stages.

'It is the escort service, being organized
by Student Government Board President
Jacob Brody, that has caused concern for
Parks and College of General Studies
Government President Marcie Roberts. ,

“We’ve looked at the plan and think it
will create more problems than it solves,”
Parks said. V

The current proposal, according to Brody
and a Campus Safety Information report
sent to students, said that a central office
would dispatch a male and female escort

pects blocked the exit of the
shop not allowing her to

pass.

The witness said she then
sought out city patrolman
David Proctor who asked the
men to leave, which sparked
the fight. Proctor testified
that it took eight officers to
subdue Gilbert.

All-Big East lineman
Brown, who has been dis-
missed from the team, was
arrested earlier in the semes-
ter on crack cocaine charges
when police raided his East
Liberty apartment.

These charges were later
dropped due to lack of evi-
dence that Brown and his
roommate, another Pitt play-
er, were aware that a large
stash of crack had been con-
cealed in the apartment.

After the second arrest,
Brown and McCray were dis-
missed from the team for the
remainder of the term, pend-
ing judicial action.

Brown, a junior from
Lynchburg, Va., was one of
the most highly recruited

defensive linemen in the
country during his senior
year in high school. He
switched to offensive line-
man in 1991 and earned
third—team Freshman All-
American honors from The
Sporting News.

That same year, Brown
was disciplined by the uni-
versity’s Judicial Board for
allegedly assaulting Stan
Clark, a team manager,
according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. Brown alleged-
ly knocked Clark’s head
against a wall after accusing
him of taking one of his
jackets.

This season, Brown earned
All-Big East Conference hon-
ors at offensive tackle.

Gilbert, 21 former All-Big
East defensive end at
Pitt, left the Panthers follow-
ing his junior season to
make himself available
for the 1992 NFL Draft.
The Rams grabbed Gilbert
with the third pick overall in
the first round, and he went
on to earn All-Rookie hon-
ors.

Kinavey said he hopes that the rally will
gather support and encourage people to
attend the march.

“This march is important because discrimi-
nation against gays and lesbians exist in all
areas of our society,”- Kinavey Said. “lNetworl'<
Q’s] rally will serve to remind Pittsburghers
that our diversity as a city is our strength and
that we must all work together to end unjust
discrimination. V

Speakers at the rally will include Greg
Spicer, a Pitt graduate student, and Joe
Pauley, a gay veteran who will speak about
the importance of lifting the military ban.

“If the government is allowed to discrimi-
nate, what will stop others from doing the
same?” Pauley said.

While Layos does support the demand for
equal rights, she insists that the gay and les-
bian community is not fighting for special
privileges. ‘

“Many people who oppose the amendment
try to say we want special rights. That is com-
pletely false,” Layos said. “I just want to live
my life without worrying about getting fired,
without discrimination. I want to move on
and deal with more important issues. It is
the 1990s —— it seems we all should be past
this.”

The Barrys began to discuss

They quit Friendly’s and Cape

into academic life.

“We were both out of touch
with school,” Susan said. “We
wanted to start out at a smaller
school with a slower pace.”

After getting acclimated,
David started classes at the Art
Institute for illustration. Susan
transferred to Pitt and majored
in English writing. They will
both graduate this year and
relocate wherever David finds a
job. Neither wants a high-cal-
iber, pressure-filled job. They
dream of eventually running
their own small restaurant and
doing writing and illustrating on
the side.

“We don’t want SOK a year,”
Susan said. “We just want peace
of mind and to raise a family.”

In an article in IX/orleing
Woman, frequent career con-
tributor Anita Gates suggested
taking evening classes as a way
of testing the waters while you
keep your present job.

David’s sister Eileen Barry, 40,
loved her job handling claims
over the phone for a tiny insur-

 

ance office, until the office fold- L
ed two years ago. Barry got »

another job with a larger com-
pany but hated the backbiting,
competitive environment.

She always wanted to be a

nurse, so she started taking ‘

evening classes at CCAC to earn.
an associate degree in nursing,
while keeping the job she had.

This year, Eileen felt confi-
dent enough about her choice
to quit her insurance job and
take a night shift job in a nurs-
ing home. The job will give her
experience and help her be sure
she is cut out for nursing — an
important step in a career
change.

Will employers fault those
who switch careers and come
looking for a job?

No, said Bob Perkoski, direc-
tor of Pitt’s Job Placement
Services.

“If you know that you’re not
in the right career path, switch.
If you’re focused,’ if you know
what you want to do now, that’s
the key,” he said.

team to walk with anyone
requesting the service. The
escorts would be equipped
with radios linking them to
the Department of Safety.

Brody said that even
though the service would
only be offered on campus,
“there are graduate stu-
dents in South Oakland
and some who visit
Hillman Library who would
probably like to have an
escort to a parking lot.”

Presently, paid students
are being considered as
escorts, which raises objec-
tions from student leaders
about their competence
in such a role and that
older students would be
escorted by younger peo-
ple.

Roberts said she ques-
tions the effectiveness of
the entire proposal and the
desire of students she rep-
resents to have an escort
service. CGS students gen-
erally are part-time or
night—school students.

“CGS will oppose any
new fee for this service and

will oppose any use of an
existing fee for the ser-
vice,” she added.

Parks said he does not
favor the plan since his stu-
dent representatives have
not requested an escort
service.

“I’d rather see the money
go for a rape counseling
and victim crime center,”
he said.

Assault

Continued from page 6

others stemming from acquaintance sexu-
al assaults, according to Counseling
Center Director Dr. Robert Gallagher.

°About a dozen students who had
been raped by someone they knew

talked about their experiences with

‘Resident Director Jon Conlogue.

“Date rape” on campus is not a new
phenomenon. What is new is the recent
increase in students seeking legal and

- psychiatric counseling, medical treatment

and advice from someone other than their
best friend or roommate.

Resident assistants to administrators are
faced more often these days with students
who were sexually assaulted by an
acquaintance.

Former Assistant Director of Residence
Life Jerry Kowalski says he dealt with
only one or two cases of date rape a year
during his 1982389.’

I But Jon Conlogue, who filled
Kowalski’s position, says he has talked
with about a dozen students over the past
year.

Many say this increase is due not neces-
sarily to an increase in the crime itself, but
to a heightened awareness of date rape
and acceptance of its victims.

lncreased- publicity about rape on col-

lege campuses is forcing a change in uni?

versities as well. Spurred on by last sum—
mer’s amendments to the Federal Higher
Education Act, several Pitt departments
formed the Sexual Assault Task Force to
deal with this old but only recently con-
fronted problem.

The Task Force, which began meeting
in January, is made up of several depart-
ment directors, including the counseling
and health centers, Office of Residence
Life, judicial and student affairs as well as
students and counseling experts outside
the university.

Task Force Chair and Provost Dr.I

Elizabeth Baranger said that although the
law provided the impetus for the Task
Force, Pitt is doing more than it must.

,_,“It wasn’t just that we intended to look
at the law and say ‘what do we have to do
to satisfy the law?” Baranger said. “We are
going beyond the law to try and improve
both the education, services for the victim
and the reporting.” '

According to the law, Pitt and other
government-funded colleges and univer-
sities must submit a “statement of policy
regarding —— (i) such institutions campus
sexual assault programs, which shall be

aimed at prevention of sex offenses; and

(ii) the procedures followed once a sex
offense has occurred.”
“Goingbeyond the law,” the Task

Force has made a recommendation to
create a new administrative position to
deal with the services and education
regarding sexual offenses.

“It’s clear that there needs to be one
central person who would be designated
sexual assault coordinator that everybody
would know that you’d go to if you need-
ed help,” Baranger said.

“Someone you could even look up in
the phone book under sexual assault
coordinator.” ,

A second recommendation is to pro-
vide students -——— particularly first-year stu-
dents — with an educational brochure
that clearly defines date rape and what
steps to take as a victim. ,

-The third recommendation, which,
according to Baranger, is still in the plan~
ning stages, is to create a discreet report-
ing system in order to get a more accurate
picture of the problem that statistics fail to
show. Pitt reported only three on—campus
rapes in all of 1992.

“The catch 22 is how to make it as easy
as possible for people to report the mini-
mum facts about the case if they aren’t
going to press charges,” said Assistant
Provost Ann Rawlinson, another member
of the Task Force.

One {suggestion has been to create a
proxy report that could be filled out —

only with the student’s pemiission —— by
counselors, doctors or Resident Directors,
who deal directly with victims. The report
then would be sent to Public Safety
where it would become an anonymous
statistic.

Other groups on campus were single-
handedly battling date rape long before
the university—wide Task Force and the
federal government’s official assault on
sex offenses.

About three years ago, RDs and RAs of
the Office of Residence Life formed an
awareness program known as Sexual
Assault and Violence Education
(S.A.V.Ed). This program, currently apply-
ing for student group status, is trying to
educate people who may not realize
when they have crossed the line to
becoming “rape victims” or “rapists.”

“lS.A.V.Ed’sl goal is to give you. the real-
ization it could happen to you,” said RA
and S.A.V.Ed member Mark Crescenzi.

The senior engineering student said he
got involved with S.A.V.Ed because he
knows people who have been raped and
sexually assaulted “many times over.”

Crescenzi said he hopes the program,
which conducts awareness workshops in
the required freshman studies classes, will
help dispel the belief that date rape is
“socially acceptable.”

Smoking bill ignites ﬁre

Just recently, Sen. Stewart Greenleaf (R—Montgomery County) intro-
duced a bill that would ban smoking in almost all public and many private
buildings. Smoking would be eliminated in bars, restaurants, work places,
shopping malls and even in Three Rivers Stadium where Pirate Manager
Jim Ieyland has been seen from time to time taking a pulf in the dugout.

. The Greenleaf Bill has good intentions. Many people are allergic to sec-
ond-hand smoke, and according to Environmental Protection Agency
reports, second-hand smoke kills over 3,000 people a year. q

‘‘We all know the hazards of second-hand smoke and the toll it takes
on non-smokers. Now it’s time that we take action on what we know and
protect the victims of environmental tobacco smoke,” said Greenleaf.

It is true that the bill is remarkably benevolent. Even in restaurants and
bars with non-smoking sections, most individuals are not protected from
second-hand carcinogens. Smoke diffuses through vents and across tables,
only to end up in the lungs of innocent bystanders.

Even so, we have to question the necessity of this bill; not for what it
says but for how it is being accomplished. Smoking is unhealthy — plain
and simple. But is it necessary for the government to legislate on an issue
where the battle is clearly being won on its own’

Smokers in the United States now make up only 25 percent of society, a
far cry from many other nations, like Japan and Denmark, where as many
as 70 percent of the people smoke. This year, more people have been
successful in their attempts‘ to quit smoking than ever before.

In other words, people themselves are making the choice not to smoke.
Just as people can decide if they want to enter a bar or restaurant where
smoking is allowed. If the demand is there, then restaurant owners and
their customers will ban smoking on their own. They don’t need the gov-
ernment to do it for them. '

“Big Brother” insists on speeding the process up and removing smokers
from every place but the privacy of their own homes. Maybe that’s next.
As if there weren’t more important issues for the government to take care

of anyway.

Race relations on campus

You didn’t even have to read the article in this week’s US News and Wonki
Report to know whatit was going to say. The report said that race relations
on campus are not as they appear to be in college brochures. Blacks and
whites are not joined together in unity. On the contrary, most universities are
quasi—seg1egated with two campuses (one black and one white) existing
simultaneously.

College newspaper editors at 64 percent of large universities described
race relations as fair or poor on their campuses. Stories about racial violence

_ and discrimination are prevalent throughout the country. i J
For example, last April a racial brawl at Michigan’s Olivet College, resul —

ing from a white students allegations of harassment, ended in the temporary
withdrawal of the school’s 60 black students and the hospitalization of two
others. '

At the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill black students have been
engaged in a battle with the university administration for a black cultural
center, which the administration claims is segregationist

The stories, while slightly better at the University of Pittsburgh, are not
much different A racial incident eariier this year led to the resignation of a
Resident Director in Lothrop Hall, and African-American students at Pitt have
organized quite impressively in a struggle to attain a black cultural center of
their own. But the question remains: Are race relations on campus as bad as
the media makes them out to be? Communication is something that is sup-
posedtobeaunifyingforce.Buthere, as insomanyothercases, articles
like this one do more to create divisiveness than they do to cure it.

Racism sells. That’s the problem. While college brochures may not be the
way of life on most mmpuses neither are violent demonstrations or unequal
opportunities. Magazines like US. News and World Rqron‘ continue to harp
on it and paint it in the form of a blad< cultural center or a passive demon-
stration. But that’s not racism. And until everyone starts taking responsiblity
for their own actions, improvements are a long way oﬂf.

A senior's final thoughts of Pitt
Gree/es, The '0’, tbe Union, are all at part of life at Pitt

After four glorious years of
undergraduate study at the
University of Pittsburgh, this
student has decided to leave
a worthwhile contribution to

. futurelgenerations of Pitt stu-

dents. Hopefully, a copy of

this article will accompany

every freshman survival
guide. Please remember, I
call ‘em like I see ‘em. '
-There seems to be a perpet-
uating myth that Greeks are
snobby, elitist, big-haired
people who only care about
their own vanity. This is not
true. After co-existing with
the Greeks and personally
witnessing a pledge, I am
confident in saying that not
all Greeks have/big hair.
-Many lengthy debates have
arisen over the best place to
eat “after-hours” (usually 3
a.m.). Hands down winner is
the Original. Whether you are
interested in a large, cheap
pizza or a light tonnage of
fries, the “O” cannot be beat.
The fries satisfy well after the

initial feasting. I can remem— A

ber feeling those fries in my
stomach for days afterwards.
I think it was Plato who said,
“Buy a man ‘O’ fries and
you’ve fed him for a week.”
-As an avid fan of William
Pitt Union ground floor bath-
room graffiti, I regret to say a
new bathroom has been cho-
sen the best on campus.
According to the research
team of Krastek and Neuff,
the Public Health building is
an all-around wonderful
“relief” spot. Yes, they have
researched bathroom
ambiance.

-It is about time that we (the
apathetic student body) stand
up and demand a financial
overhaul of this institution.
Imagine what would happen
to the university’s programs,
such as sports and research,
if 20,000 people decided on a
plan collectively. Maybe
some of you have forgotten J.

Dennis’ $92,500 party last
year, but I have not. Next
time you plan a get together,
he sure you do not buy the
beer from the same distribu-
tor Pitt did. If you cannot
help it, then ask for about a
$9,250 cover charge.

°Carnpus crime is always 21
hot topic during the semes-
ter. Here is the situation in a
nut shell. A crime takes
place; people whine for

Tim
Desmond

improvements in safety; safe-
ty seminars are held; nobody
shows up. I would like a date
with Cindy Crawford, but cry-
ing about it constantly is not
going to improve my chances
of getting it.

°Everyone is familiar with

the local vendors who occu-

py the precious real estate
between the William Pitt
Union and the ‘Cathedral. A
new stand should be appear-
ing soon: the law firm of Bill
and Bob. It’s actually a new
convenience for students
crossing in between classes.
When a car hits you, instead
of driving to the office you
can now crawl over to the
stand and fill out the paper-
work. Do not be afraid of
pain, walk right into the mid-
dle of the street because Bill
and Bob say, “The more you
break, the more we’ll take!”

-In the past years the only
improvement in the Oakland
parking scene has come at
the expense of the Syria
Mosque. This lot, however,
charges about $117 per hour.
If you plan on commuting to
Pitt you have a couple of
options: ride the bus along
with Dr. Frankenstein’s assis-
tant Igor. Other options
include parking in Cleveland
and riding the shuttle up to

campus, or you can find a '

way to remove the wonderful
orange boot installed at no
extra charge. I personally
prefer the campus shuttle,

sometimes they serve minia-

ture bags of peanuts and tiny
bottles of alcohol.

°Best part of the University
of Pittsburgh: Professor Van
“The Man” Beck Hall. In an
atmosphere of an uncaring
and unsympathetic faculty,
Van is the shining example of
the almost extinct professor
who cares. Hats_ off to you,

' professor.

°For those of you having
trouble filling out forms for
graduate school, I have some
advice: a big mistake is to
admit you are a straight,
white, middle—class male; for-
get actual qualifications
because you are everyone’s
enemy. Checking those boxes
on an application will get the
pleasant, “You are on our
waiting list” response. In
other words: lie, Michael
Jackson gets away with it.’

°Sending unsuspecting visi-
tors to St. Francis when they
ask how to get to Bruce Hall
is always amusing. Just in
case there are not any saps
asking for directions, try the

police ‘blotter. If anyone is ‘

interested, I plan on starting
a Hillman Library Masturbator
fan club. Thanks to the
police blotter, we can track
our superhero’s every "fun-
filled adventure.

Four‘ years ofa college
education and I have learned
that I know nothing. The
moreyou study, the more
you realize how much of the
world is out there and how
little you know. Of course,
Pitt has not left a totally neg-
ative mark on me. I will bet
that guy that asked me how
to get to Bruce Hall in 1990
is still walking down Forbes
Avenue.
Peace.

I could be him.,

Bill Junker gutted out a complete game victory in game one 7

of Pitt's doubleheader sweep of Seton Hall.

tt baseball a not-so-sleepy gr  ~..   .. t in twin mu bombings

By Gory Walborn

Senior Staff Writer

When Seton Hall Coach Mike Sheppard called
the Pitt baseball team a “sleeping giant,” he had
some idea of what might happen yesterday after-
noon.

Sheppard said he realized the hidden talent of
the Panthers well before the Big East season was
underway. But nothing could cushion the blow of
stats on this sunny day. .

The sickening stats for Sheppard were 28 hits, 26
runs and two Pitt victories in a six-hour span. The
giant was wide awake.

Using a tremendous hitting performance, led by
center fielder Al Lardo, second baseman Brad
Reese and first baseman Jason Roth, Pitt pounded
Seton Hall 8-4 and 18-5 in a Big East double-head-
er yesterday. The wins raised the Panthers’ record
to 23-5 overall and 6-3 in the Big East.

“I’ll give all the credit to Pitt,” Sheppard said.
“They murdered the ball today.”

“People were just crushing the ball,” Lardo said.
“Everyone was hitting at the right time.”

The right time came in the second game of the
double-header. Winning 18-5, all the Pitt batters
got in on the fun.

“We hit some balls real hard,” Pitt head coach
Mark Jackson said. “Everybody was going up there
swinging.”

Lardo hit his second home run of the day in
game two and contributed four RBIs as well. Roth
had four hits and two RBIs, while left ﬁelder Craig
Crawley had three hits and two RBIs to boot. ‘

Reese and shortstop Danny Gonzalez collected
three hits and three RBIs a piece to add to the hit-
ting barrage. '

With one hit after another, the momentum was
definitely on Pittis side.

“Everybody can go up there more relaxed,”
Reese said, explaining the good feeling created at

the plate with such a good hitting performance.
“You can be more aggressive and take an aggres-
sive swing at your pitch.”

While Pitt’s bats were on fire, the Panther pitch-
ing was solid. Pitt starter Rob Hanawalt (1-0)
pitched a good ﬁve and one-third innings but left
with a sore shoulder. Middle reliever David Kelley
came in for Hanawalt and was perfect, blanking

_ the Pirates for two and two-thirds innings. Kelley

allowed Pitt’s bats to take control.

With the score tied at 1-1 after one, the Panthers
started the second with a ﬁve-run surge. Singles by
Lardo, catcher Pat Walsh, Reese and Gonzalez
capped the rally. ,

Pitt added a run in the third and fourth, the latter
produced by Lardo’s second home run of the
game. '

“Lardo has done nothing out of the ordinary,”
Jackson said about Lardo’s “hot” bat. “He has
power and good bat speed.”

“I dropped down an ounce and an inch on the
bat,” Lardo said. “It helped my hand speed, I can
now turn on the inside pitch.”

It was Lardo’s third home run in three games and
his second solo shot of the day with no outs.

“I tend to be more aggressive with no outs,”
Lardo said of his hitting. “I’1l swing at the first-pitch
fastball.” -

It seemed like all the Pitt batters were not swing-
ing at the f1rst—pitch fastball in the ﬁfth inning, they
were looking at it. Scoring 10 runs on the strength
of six walks, the Panthers travelled around the
bases like a merry-go-round. Lengthening the
advantage to 18-2, the route was on.

In game one, signs of the dominance displayed
in the second game route were showing. With the
score tied 4-4 in the bottom of the sixth inning,
Panther designated hitter Ken Strish doubled to
right-center. Third baseman Josh Tyler was then hit

by a Chad Frontera pitch. That pitch sent the Seton"

April showers  with sg ootball as Gold reigns 22-14

ByJason Brame
Staff Writer

As sporadic rain fell upon the 200 or so spectators
that came out to witness the return of Panther head
coach Johnny Majors, Pitt’s Gold team rode an 84-yard
kickoff return by Jay Jones to a 22-14 victory over the
Blue in the annual Blue-Gold Game.

Majors watched from the press box as the two teams
fought through 40 minutes of sometimes-sloppy foot-
ball.

“Overall I thought it was a pretty well—played spring
game,” Majors said. “There were very few mistakes
like alignment, jumping offsides and illegal proce-
dures. The most exciting thing about today is we
won.”

The game was the culmination of Pitt’s annual
spring practice, in which Majors got his first look at the
squad. Despite a cupboard that is more bare now than
when he first came to Pitt in 1973, Majors was cau-
tiously upbeat about his team’s effort.

“We made progress in virtually every area,” Majors
said of the team’s practice sessions. “Every phase
needs to be improved  and we need help at every
position. But We saw improvement in discipline, hus-
tle, attitude and effort.”

Majors didn’t have to wait very long for scoring as
the Gold’s Tim Colicchio punched in a three—yard
touchdown in the first quarter to give the Gold a 6-0
lead. Quarterback Ken Ferguson began the drive with
a 28-yard pass completion to receiver Chuck Coe and

watched as Chad Askew dropped a beautiful fade pass‘

in the comer of the end zone before Colicchio rushed
for the team’s first score.

The Gold also tallied late in the second when kicker
Chris Belculfine converted a 27-yard ﬁeld goal as time
expired to put the Blue in a 10-0 hole going into the

Men's track tunes up for Penn Relays against local teams

Tony Fiorini/T he Pitt News
Pitt's Jonathan Dixon set a personal best time in winning
the 110 hurdles at this Weekend's Panther Relays.

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s track team used Sunday’s
Panther Relays at Pitt Stadium as a tune-up
meet for Thursday’s Penn Relays. Teams
from local schools Carnegie Mellon,
Duquesne, Robert Morris and Thiel College
competed.

Because NCAA regulations limit the num-
ber of meets an athlete can compete in per
season, several»Pitt runners did not compete
in this meet.

Even though the Panthers weren’t serious-
ly tested by the competition, they still
received several strong individual perfor-
mances.

“Jim Monk and Jonathan Dixon were two
highlights of the meet,” Pitt head coach John
Vasvary said. “They both work real hard and
it’s nice to see it pay off.”

Monk won the discus with a throw of 152-
10 and in the process qualified for the
Eastern Championships (IC4As). Monk also
won the shot—put with a mark of 50-00.

Dixon won the 110 hurdles with a person-
al best of 14.68 seconds, which also quali-
fied him for IC4As. Dixon also won the 400
intermediate hurdles with a time of 55.13
seconds. —

“Jonathan is really running well. He should

help us on the shuttle hurdle relay team,”
Vasvary said.

Tim Flanders will join Monk and Dixon at
the IC4As as he qualified in the decathlon
with a total of 6,754 points. Flanders set
personal bests in‘ both the high jump and
long jump in his way to breaking a Pitt
record.

“That was just a great performance by
Tim,” Vasvary said. “It’s good to get Tim
qualified.”

Thrower Dave Senay, middle distance run-
ner Wayne Smith and two distance runners,
Mike Umbleby and Mike Lynn, used the
meet to turn in their best performances as
well.

Senay won the hammer throw with a per-
sonal best of 155-5 1/2. Senay also finished
second in the shot—put and third‘ in the dis-
Cus.

Smith turned in his best performance of
the year in winning the 800—meter run with a
time of 1:55.97. Devvon Bradley finished
third for Pitt with a time of 1:56.37.

Umbleby and Lynn set personal bests as
they both crossed the finish line well ahead
of the rest of the field in the 1,500-meter run
in a time of 5:55.50.

The Panthers will travel to Philadelphia
this Thursday to compete in their biggest
meet of the year, the Penn Relays.

Devils, 6-3

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

All season long, the
Pittsburgh Penguins have
showed the hockey world
that they are the most domi-
nant team that the NHL has
‘seen in years.

They continued to lay their
claim to greatness as the
1992-’93 Stanley Cup
Playoffs began yesterday.

Under the spotlight of
n a t i o n a 1
television
coverage on
ABC, the
P e n g u i n s
showed the
entire country what they
have been showing the
Pittsburgh fans all season --
the way to control a hockey
game.

The Pens did that job to
perfection in a 6-3 victory
_over the New Jersey Devils
in the first game of their
best-of—seven Patrick
Division semifinal series.
This game was never even as
close as the final score.

Pittsburgh outplayed the
Devils in every facet of the
game. In particular, they
offered a~clinic in goal—scor—
ing technique. Led by cap-
tain Mario Lemieux —— who
made it look like another
day at the office with his two
goals and two assists — the
Pens opened fire early.

With the Pens on a power
play early in the first period,
Rick Tocchet grabbed the
puck off the boards after
Kevin Stevens shot and
flipped it past Devils’ goal-
tender Chris Terreri to take a
1-0 lead.

Later in the first, after New
Jersey had scored to tie the
game at one, Jaromir jagr
and Lemieux barrelled into

Pitt Women's track reaches goals at Panther Relays

By Matt Groff
Staﬁ“ Writer

The‘ Pitt women’s track team had goals
beyond beating the local competition at the
Panther Relays yesterday, and according to
track head coach Steve Lewis, the team met
all of those goals.

“We wanted to get people qualiﬁed for
ECACS, improve the times and decide who
should compete in certain events in the
upcoming weeks,” Lewis said. “And today
we got all of that accomplished.”

In addition to qualifying for F.CACs, Pitt
athletes Katina Miles and Najuma Fletcher
qualiﬁed for NCAA provisionals in the hep-
tathlon. Miles’ score set a new Pitt record
and Lewis said they both have a good shot

at going to the NCAA National
Championships in that event.

“The NCAA sets certain standards for
inviting athletes to the national champi-
onship,” Lewis said. “As provisional quali-
ﬁers, Miles and Fletcher are on the list which
is evaluated for national championship
qualiﬁers.”

Competing along with Miles and Fletcher
at ECACs will be teammate Ayodella Iewis,
who took third place in the heptathlon.

Allison Williams and Tonya Mullins both
qualiﬁed for ECACs in their one—two ﬁnish
in the 400—meter hurdle. Williams, an All-
American indoor hurdler, said the Panther
Relays were a boost to Pitt’s track team.

“It builds morale,” Williams said. “There
isn’t the high pressure of traveling and then

competing against 50 other teams. We can
focus on our times and improving our relay
combinations.”

Pitt’s 4 x 100 relay (Mullins, Williams,
Renee Pope and Ronise Crumpler) proved
to be a successful combination, running the
fastest time of any Pitt 4 x 100 team this year
in their ﬁrst—place ﬁnish.

Cnrmpler also ran one of the best times
for Pitt this year in her 800-meter perfor-
mance that took ﬁrst place.

First-place honors went to Staci Suggs and
Melanie Ishman for their respective perfor-
mances in the 1,50()—meter run and 100-
meter hurdles. Ishman also took second
place in the 3,000 meter, behind teammate
Carmela Mariani.

Pope won the 200 meter and qualiﬁed for

ECACs in her second—place ﬁnish in the 100.
Lewis said that competing at home, a rare
luxury for a Panther team that competed in
Tennessee, Florida and Alabama in the past
month, played a role in Pitt’s success.

“It’s a big difference,” Lewis said. “Athletes
are competing in front of their friends and at
the same place where they practice.”

Pitt will be on the road for its upcoming
meets, traveling to the Penn Relays in
Philadelphia this Thursday and on to the
Big East Championships in two weeks.

Williams, who is competing in both of the
meets, said he is optimistic.

“I’m excited for the Penn Relays,”
Williams said. “We had a good meet today,
and I think we can be successful next
week.”

— Matt Serlin/The Pitt News
The Panthers congratulated center ﬁelder Al Lardo after a home run in the first game of

yesterday's twin bill bombing of the Pirates. Lardo also homered in game two.

Hall starter to the bench and
brought in reliever Jamie Fisher.
Fisher promptly threw an errant
ball to first, allowing pinch—run—
ner Brian Henne to score.

With two on and no outs,
Reese doubled in Tyler. Then
back-to—back singles by short-
stop Danny Gonzalez and left
fielder Kurt Allen plated Walsh
and Reese.

That four—run burst was the
timely hitting that Pitt starter Bill
Junker needed. Junker (4-2) did
not have his best stuff in game
one, but he got the job done.

“He came back when he had
to,” Reese said on Junker’s gutty
performance. “You can always
count on him.”

“A sign of a good pitcher is
one that makes the most on any
given day,” Jackson said.
“[Junker] really shut them down.”

Throwing a complete game in
seven innings of work, Junker
allowed only six hits, four runs
and two walks. He stuck out
three, while only giving up one
costly hit, a three-run home run
to Seton Hall’s Dan Clarke in the

Before Clarke’s shot, Pitt came
out of the first with a three-run
advantage. Pitt’s Crawley led off
the inning with a walk and
advanced to second when Lardo
followed with .a single. Crawley
tagged up and moved to third on
Roth’s deep sacrifice ﬂy to right,
and scored on a double steal,

with Lardo moving to second,

Strish followed with a walk and
the bases were full after Tyler
singled. Walsh then hit a two-out
blooper over third base to score
Lardo and Strish, giving Pitt a 3-0
lead.

After Clarke’s home run tied
the score, Junker settled down
and retired 10 straight batters.
While Junker motored along,
Lardo. put the. Panthers in front
with his first home run of the
day, a lead-off blast to left field
in the third.

With Pitt leading 4-3 into the
sixth, Seton Hall tied the score
on a sacrifice ﬂy by catcher Alex
Andreopoulos, forcing Pitt to do
some timely hitting in the bot-
tom of the inning to pull out the
win.
Pens

Continued from page 10
the Devils end, with Jagr car-
rying the puck and Lemieux
following to Jagr’s left.
Terreri was completely
fooled when Jagr, who ‘nor-
mally takes the initiative to
shoot the puck himself in
those situations, instead
flipped a backhand pass to
Lemieux, who one-timed a
shot into the wide-open net
to give the,Pens a 2-1 lead.
They would never look
back.

The Penguins decided to
put away the game in the
second period and succeed-
ed by scoring three unan-
swered goals.

The first came
the Magnificent One, left
all alone in front of the
net, found the puck and
buried it into the upper cor-
ner to give the Pens a 3—1
advantage.

Later, Ron‘Francis, who
always picks it up two
notches for playoff time,
grabbed a rebound to
Terreri’s right and notched
his first playoff goal, increas-
ing the Penguin lead to 4—1.

Dave Tippett closed out

the second—period scoring I

when Jagr found him streak-
ing toward the net, passed
him the puck, which
he promptly shot past
Terreri to give the Pens a
5-1 lead. ‘

Jagr finally put the wraps
on a fantastic individual per-
formance by scoring his first
of what will be many playoff
goals with a backhand shot
while traveling across the
goal crease to make it 6-1
Pens.

The Devils added two
meaningless goals down the
stretch, but it was a moot
point, for the Pens had
already taken the first step
toward retaining the Stanley
Cup.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 19, 1993

Football

Continued from page 9
Blue’s deficit to only two at
16-14.

Jones’ touchdown return
galvanized a soggy Pitt
Stadium crowd. Taking the
kickoff from his own 16, Jones
scampered the 84 yards while
breaking several Blue tackles.

“Kick-off returns set up the
offense and give good field
position,” Jones said. “I’ve
worked on hitting the wedge
like today.”

In what is possibly the most
open position on the team,
quarterback Ferguson outdu-
elled counterpart John Ryan

' by completing four of seven

passes for 86 yards, compared
to Ryan’s three of eight for 24
effort. Despite statistical simi-
larities, Ferguson clearly
played the better of the two
while Ryan was obviously ten-
tative in the game.

“The quarterback spot will
be wide open during the sum-
mer,” Majors said. ‘‘I hope [the
competition] will create good
practice habits over the sum-
met.”

The lack of offensive depth
that plagues Majors is most
evident at the quarterback
spot, where there was literally
no one available to spell the
two starters for the game. And
despite the arrival of recruit
Pedro Gonzalez from Miami in
the summer, the team will
most deﬁnitely be lacking at

the head offensive spot.

“We’d like to have someone
walk on because I’ve never
had only three quarterbacks
[on a team] in my career,”
Majors said. “If a [walk-on] is
good enough to help us win,
we’ll put him on scholarship.”

Defensively, the Gold got
big games from sophomore
linebacker Jason Chavis, who
recorded five tackles, three
unassisted, and David
Sumner, who notched five
with four unassisted.

Tom Tumulty paced the
Blue with five total tackles.
First-year defensive back Jim
Williams also pulled in four
for the Blue.

‘‘We’ve made subtle
improvements each day [of
spring practicel,” Tumulty
said. “[But there’s] lots of work
to be done if we’re to be the
defense of our capability.
We’re not lacking effort, but
schematics [of the systeml”

Tumulty has had no prob-
lems with a pectoral muscle
injury that sidelined him for
the 1992 campaign. The red-
shirt sophomore has “gotten a
little lighter” and gained some
needed speed at outside
backer in the Panthers’ new
attack 4-3.

“I never think about [my
chest] during practice,” he
said. ‘‘I try to block it from my
mind, and I’m doing a good
job of it.”
