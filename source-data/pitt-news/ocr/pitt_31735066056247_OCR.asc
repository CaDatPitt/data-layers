Republican

candidates say

they will ﬁght
Oakland crime

By Randy Knapick
Staff Writer

Republican judicial candidates Pat Scanlon and
Judge Donald Machen outlined their positions at
last night’s College Republicans meeting. 9

Because Tom Murphy’s commanding lead in

Pittsburglfs mayoral race may cause low voter V

turnout on election day, Republican judicial can-
didates see an opportunity to win seats in a heav-
ily democratic area, according to John Robert
Clark, chair of Pittsburgh’s Republican
Committee‘.

“This is a significant election,” Clark said.

Scanlon, who is running for district justice, said
she actively promotes public safety and is
involved in many community organizations.

“I know this community intimately,” "Scanlon,
who is a Pitt graduate and Oakland resident for
52 years, said. V

Scanlon chairs the Pittsburgh Nuisance Bar
Task Force and ~Oakland’s Neighborhood Social
Service Agency, an organization she has been
involved with since its inception in 1965.

She is a mediator with the Pittsburgh Mediation

_ Center and an arbitrator with the Better Business

Bureau.

In the area of public safety Scanlon co-chairs
Oakland Community Oriented Policing, the first
community policing program of its kind in
Pittsburgh. ,

She said improvements in public safety have
been made in Oakland, though further anticrime
measures are necessary.

Scanlon helped to create crime watch pro-
grams for Oakland as well as Pitt’s dormitories.

“I am deeply involved with the public safety
people here at Pitt,” she said.

Scanlon said 85 percent of casesbefore the dis-
trict justiceinvolve landlord—tennant disputes,
and her experience with housing concerns as
chair of the Oakland Housing Code Task Force
will prove useful. - I

“I bring experience, maturity, training, com-
mon sense, ethics and integrity, the things that
are needed to do the job,” Scanlon said.

“My history shows I am a person, not a politi-
cian,” she said. “I think I will bring a lot to the
bench.”

Pittsburgh Magistrate judge Donald Machen,
seeking election to the Common Pleas Court,

j also spoke at last night’s meeting.

The foundations for a decidedly
shorter and more exciting Greek
Week were laid out at the 1994 Greek
Week Orientation meeting.

“Greek Week was very drawn out
last year. We are trying to cut it down
and to make it more fun at the same
time,” Greek Week Events Chair
Jennifer McCue said.

Greek Week organizers said they
not only want to increase fun, but
hope to increase the funds raised for
charity as well. “Our goal is to
increase the volunteering [from last
year] and to raise money, yet still have
fun in the process. We raised $96,000
last year and hope to raise a lot more

this year,” Business Manager Kelly
Reddy said.

The funds raised will be donated to
Special Olympics, according to Cassi
Berarducci, overall co-chair for Greek
Week. The traditional Greek Week
blood drive will benefit Central Blood
Bank.

Danny Mays, a Special Olympian
from the Allegheny County chapter of
the organization spoke to Greeks on
the importance of their activities. “Just
because we have mental disabilities
doesn’t mean that we can’t achieve
our dreams  but we need people
like you to help support us.”

Dave Edmunds, a senior consultant
for Central Blood Bank, also spoke to
the Greeks in an effort to rally their
support for the blood drive which will

Fraternities, sororitiesplan Gree/e Wee/e ’94

take place Nov. 1 through 5.

“You save three lives with each
donation [of blood]. We’re looking for
another record—breaking year this
year,” Edmunds said.

Greek historians Teresa Soto and
Mary Collins said they will also be try-
ing to raise money for Greek Week
while preserving memories of Greek
Week on videotape. The videotape

will include pictures and live footage

of the week all set to music. The tape
should be on sale at the end of the
year, Soto said. '
“We’re really trying to make things a
lot more fun, but still keep the spirit of
fund—raising there,” overall co-chair
Erin Walker said. “We’re also trying to

New programs strives to cut down on bike theft problem

By Steve Kozarovich ’ .
News Assistant -

A high number of student
bike thefts has prompted a new
program to deal with bike thefts
and provide money for more
bike racks.

Student Government Board
member August Imholtz said he
met last week with Bob Harkins
and Kathleen Miller, both of the
department of Parking and
Transportation, to brainstorm
possible ways to deal with cur-

rent bike problems on campus.

The result of the brainstorm is
Bike Registration Days. All Pitt
students will be able to register
their bikes at a booth in
Schenley Quad from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. today through Friday.

Students registering their
bikes serves two purposes,
according to SGB members
Imholtz and Tony Moody.

The first reason is to assemble
an accurate count of Pitt stu-
dents who bring their bikes to
campus or would bring them if
there were more bike racks

available. Registering bikes
would also makevit easier for
information about bikes to be
provided to campus police if a
bike were stolen.

Imholtz said that campus
police has reported 29 bikes
stolen at Pitt since July of this
year.

Another reason for registra-
tion is related to the interest
neededto justify ﬁnancial sup-
port from the university. In this
case, the university is willing to
provide the necessary funds for
new bike racks.

The department of Parking
and Transportation would
be willing to spend money on
new bike racks if enough inter-
est is shown, according to
Harkins.

Although registration has

‘been available since the begin-

ning of the semester, less than
100 bikes are registered with the
university, Miller said.

“Their department is prepared
to spend a lot of money,”
Imholtz said, “but they need
interest.”

Imholtz said it only takes a

minute to register, and it is ben-
eﬁcial in the long run.

“Students should make an
effort to register their bikes
because it’s no cost to the stu-
dents, and it benefits all current
and potential bike riders,”
Moody said. “But after Friday it
won’t help.”

The booth at Schenley Quad
will also have theft avoidance
information, a bike lock demon-
stration and safe cycling tips.
Campus Public Safety will also
be participating, offering free
bicycle etchings.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, October 26, 1993

Cover letters are just as important as resumes

Last month I outlined the
basics of résumé writing.
Today’s column will provide
some tips on another essential
job search communications tool
— the cover letter.

Many job candidates are
under the impression that a
well-written résumé is all that
an employer needs in order to
evaluate your qualifications.
While a resume is an important
first contact, it only provides
recruiters with a brief and gen-
eral outline of your strengths.
By contrast, a cover letter focus-
es on how these strengths can

be utilized in a particular orga-

nization.

I It stands to reason then that
you should always include a
cover letter with every résumé
you’re mailing. Don’t make the
mistake of creating a “generic”
cover letter in which only a few
words within the text are
changed for each version.

Today’s sophisticated computer‘

software programs make this a
temptingoption but resist it.

What you’ll gain in speed
and efficiency by this method
will be more than offset by the
loss of focus and that all—impor-
tant “personalized” ‘touch. None
of us takes a “Dear Occupant”
very seriously, ‘ including
recruiters.

The first step in avoiding an
assembly line cover letter is to
address it to a specific person. If
the ad or posting does not list a

name, a little bit of research and
detective work (sometimes just
a simple phone call to a compa-
ny) will usually yield a contact.
To whom should you write?
There ar/el several options.

The company’s personnel
manager or college recruiting
coordinator are good choices,
but often the best contract is the
head of the department or area

Bofremeck to achieve this
goal.”).

If you’ve done a good job on

your resume, it should be rela-
tively easy to identify
your strengths in the cover
letter. Finding out about the
company can be a bit trickier,
especially if you’re responding
to a brief newspaper ad. In
addition to the Employer

in which
you’re inter-
ested (i.e. the

libraries
sources of corporate informa-
tion, both on local firms
and on companies based out of

The main body of the cover
letter should focus on the
strengths that you mentioned in
the first paragraph.However,
keep in mind that the resume
and cover letter are only used to
get you an interview — not to
land a job.

You don’t have to go into a
lot of minute and exhaustive
detail in cover letters just tell

I employers what you learned

contain valuable’

from your education and expel
riences.

For example, “As an account
executive at The Pitt News, I
gained valuable experience in
sales and marketing, as well as
in responding promptly and
courteously to customer’s
needs.” _

In general, cover letters
shouldn’t be more than four or
five paragraphs, so stick to your
major selling points.

The closing paragraph
can often make or break a cover
letter. Whenever possible,
indicate at the end of the letter
that you will contact the
employer to arrange a mutually
convenient time for an inter-
view (unless the ad or posting
specifies that no phone calls
will be accepted or that the
company is‘loca_ted out of
state). ‘

Taking the initiative and mak-
ing the call shows confidence
and interest in the position ——
qualities that most employers
value in candidates.

letter writing is a must for suc-

. cess in today’s competitive

job market. For more informa-

“I am a very tough magis-
trate,” he said. “I don’t want
criminals on the street hurt-
ing people.”

“There’s no one in city
court protecting the victims
but me,” Machen said.

Machen has the highest
compliance rate among
Pittsburgh magistrates,
meaning fewer of the-crimi-
nals he sentences become
repeat offenders. '

Though tough on sentenc-
ing, Machen advocates
rehabilitation before jails
terms, especially for petty
offenses. = _ E
I “Everybody deserves a
second chance,” he said.

Machen said violent crimi-
nals and those who cannot
be rehabilitated, however,
must serve jail sentences.

“I’m not only for bigger
jails, but also to put people
away who are dangerous to
society and cannot be reha-
bilitated,” he said.

According to Machen,
justices must establish “a
balance between the nature
of the crime and [the crimi-
nal’s] ability for rehabilita-
tion” when delivering sen-
tences.

Machen said this philoso-
phy is especially relevant for
college students convicted of
crimes.

“I’m careful to evaluate all _
the facts,” ‘he said. “If a stu-
dent’is just starting a career,
a crime can be really devas-
tating. Once the criminal
record is in, who is going to
hire them?

“I think I’m a little more
well—rounded than some of
the other candidates,” he
said. “I think that’s impor-
tant.”

‘The Wall Street journal reported yesterday that
Washington, D.C.’s mayor requested 3,000 National
Guard troops to help control drug—related crime in the

Ucity. - A

The Mayor had. to make his request through President
Clinton for these troops, because, unlike a state’s gover-
nor, he cannot mobilize troops on his own authority.
P-resident Clinton said on Friday that Mayor Kelly”s
request would be considered, according to the Wall
Street journal _

This request points to a Very troubling trend in our
country today. Our cities have increasingly become
concrete jungles, ruled not by law and order, but by fire

power in the hands of those who have little or no

respect for human life. _
In our own city the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported a

. strange‘ attitude among some of the older inmates at the .

Allegheny County Jail. Warden Charles Kozakiewick
said that"‘older, more seasoned jail inmates had
requested cell transfers because they had no use for 
gang members,” because they lack “respect for values

. [n]ow there are no values.” The story points out that

these older, “hardened” ‘criminals are shocked by the _

new brand of criminals’ total lack of regard for human

-- life. '

What is also disturbing is that m Chicago, gangs, or
“street organizations” as they preferred to be called, are

- _ now moving into politics. They are organizing such

things as voter registration drives and political marches.
It seems that instead of directly fighting the establish-

. ment, gangs are now trying to, make the system work

for their own ends. _

These reports show that the government is increasing-
ly losing its ability to maintain law and order in the
cities.

‘I When this happens, the citizens no longer have the
protection of the government. The streets are being

ruled by groups similar to Gen. Mohammed'Farah_‘
as .Aidid’s clans that our elite forces are battling in

Mogadishu.
It is time that the United States looks at the rhetoric of
its last presidential campaign. The country’s citizens

. were promised a new focus on rebuilding the infra-

structure of the nation. .

Its seems now that the nation that was being talked
about was Somalia or perhaps Haiti. The United States
is contributing millions of dollars to nations that it can-

not possibly hope to stabilize. Instead of rebuilding-
_nations abroad, the administration should begin look-

ing homeward. V

Apparently, our own capital is incapable of policing
itself. In the supposed home of democracy,the govern-
ment is moving toward martial law in every aspect
except name. The United States cannot presume to
rebuild other nations when it does not have control in
its own nation.

In April 1992, millions of peo-
ple nationwide watched in hor-
ror as Reginald Denny was mer-

cilessly beaten by a mob of_

black men. The reason he was
beaten was simple — he was
the firstvwhite male those hooli-
gans could get their hands on.
Following the beating and the
riots, several black leaders had
the audacity to tell the American
pe’ople that we had to “feel their
rage.” Before this occurrence I
never knew that a group of
angry people had the right to
torch an entire section of a city.
This civic disorder was blamed,
once again, on something other
than the perpetrators of the
crime. It was not the last time
such a thing would happen dur-
ing this nightmare in L.A.

A positive thing to come out
of the riots was that a local
news crew had filmed the
Denny beating on videotape, so
it was thought that the criminals
would at least be punished
severely for their crimes. Think

.again, because once more the

black leaders and the ultra-lib-
erals have tried to paint the
“LA. Four” as “victims” and
apparently a biased jury has
been intimidated into buying it.
Many liberal lawyers around the
.nation were quick to come to
the defense of a jury that hand-
ed down 16 “not guilty” verdicts
on Oct. 18, the shocking “not

, guilty” of attempted murder ver-

dictlfor Williams and a mistrial
(by the judge) for Watson on
Oct. 20. It now seems that a
videotape is not enough to con-

vict because it can’t tell what «
. the defendants intent was.

University of California at Los
Angeles law professor Peter
Arenella said, “The only lesson
to be learned from this is that a
tape can’t be your whole case.”

Who is that clown trying to
fool? It was the exact same kind
of videotape that convicted
Stacey Koon and Lawrence
Powell in a federal trial, which
decided that the officers had
violated Rodney King’s civil
rights. - Arenella went on to say
that “a videotape is not always

Denny verdict will fuel racial tensions

helpful in proving what was in
the defendants’ mind.”

If that’s the case, then how
could the federal jury fairly con-
vict the L.A. police officers? Did
that jury have some kind of ESP

that the jury in the Denny beat— l

ing trial didn’t? No, they did not.
What it all‘ comes down to is a

Tony
. Dickensheets

double standard that is perme-
ating throughout this nation in
an attempt to make up for an
injustice of the past (i.e., slav-
ery) by doing an injustice in the
present (i.e., this Verdict), which
will accomplish the opposite
goal that the liberals are work-
ing for. This verdict, as with
many other liberal programs,
will only harm racial relations
and will ensure a continuation
of racial strife in this nation.

The only difference between
this case and the King beating
trial is that this time the defen-
dants are black and the victim is
white. The Video evidence that
convicted the police officers
and the video evidence in this
trial are of the same importance
to each trial and the only evi-
dence which the jury had to
decide on. Once again, the sim-
ilarities only diverge with the
race of the defendants. Another
thing that I found interesting
after these verdicts was that the
liberally-controlled media didn’t
show the Denny beating video
over and over again as they did
following the King beating trial.
I guess it isbecause this time it
was blacks that were doing the
beating (on an innocent person
in comparison to a criminal).

As long as the black leaders
such as Jesse Jackson applaud
outcomes like this verdict and
continue to tell blacks that they
are “oppressed” and can’t suc-
ceed because they are “discrimi-

nated” against, a large propor-
tion of the black community
will remain underclass. Why
doesn’t the media ever let a
black scholar such as Shelby
Steele talk on television? The
answer is simple: Steele doesn’t
buy into their constant whining
about not beingsable to live the
American dream due to discrim-
ination. I think that Shelby
Steele is a, role model for any
race and should be heard.
Jackson and the others aren’t
about to tell the black commu-
nity the truth because it is
through their rhetoric of “injus-
tice” to blacks that they make
their living. Jackson is the very
same black leader that cried
injustice when the first jury
acquitted Koon and Powell
despite the video evidence. This

time he is saying that justice

was served. Nonsense! This

kind of double-talk will only ,

continue to hinder race rela-
ﬁons — not help them.

‘Maybe the memories from
the last trial will be of the things
that didn’t happen. Despite
many whites in L.A. being out-
raged with this verdict, the
white community did not riot,
loot or burn down sections of
the city. Nor did they go around
and beat up innocent black
people. That says something
about the character of that com-
munity. The other aspect of this
trial that will long be remem-
bered is the jury that couldn’t
separate their civic duty from
their very clear personal biases.
They joined together in a collec-
tive prejudice and saw only
black and white —- not right
and wrong.. Because of their
ignorance both blacks and
whites will suffer. Because with
each not guilty verdict, race
relations in this country took
another step into the abyss of
racial hate and disharmony. A
further tearing of the social fab-
ric can only be a detriment to
the nation as a whole. Why
can’t we understand that?

Marttrt doubtful

for T792/trsa’ay’s

Big East game
versus Rutgers
By Brian Gallagher

Sports Editor

The spry, willing-but-oft-

-unable mug known as the Pitt

football team will likely be
without its :‘Razpr” for

_Thursday night’s nationally tele-

vised game against Rutgers.

Tailback Curtis Martin, who
leads the Panthers with 855 .
yards rushing and six touch-
downs, is listed as doubtful for
the ESPN matchup,’ due to a
left shoulder injury incurred in
Saturday’s loss to West Virginia.

“I doubt Curtis Martin will
play,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said at yesterday’s
weekly press ‘ conference. “The
doctors will look at him again‘
[Monday], but I think it’s doubt-
ful he’ll play Thursday.”

Already hobbled with a knee
injury, Martin injured his shoul-
der in the second quarter of the
WVU game when he took a ‘
shot over the middle after’

‘ catching a pass from quarter-

back John Ryan. Monikered the
“Razor” for" his slashing style of
running, Martin was never
sharp after the hit —-leaving

-the game for good after. two

painful and unsuccessful carries
later in the second quarter.

In addition to leading Pitt in
rushing, Martin also tops the
team in rushing attempts (152),
receptions (22) and total yards
(961). He has also converted
two two—point conversions.

Pegged’ to fill Ma1'tin’s shoes?
Billy West and Tim Colicchio,
both of whom saw consider-

.. able action in the second half

against the Mountaineers.

For the most part, whenever you mentioned
the Pitt offense, all you had to do was mutter
two simple words to sum it up: Curtis Martin.

But now, low and behold, you can add a cou-
ple more names to the increasing number of
workhorses that are grinding out yards for the
Panthers. ‘

Though Martin racked up 94 yards, the star of
I Saturday’s 42-21 loss to West Virginia may have

been Chad Dukes, a senior fullback who had
seen only limited time carrying the ball.

When Martin went out with a strained shoul-
der, after taking a tremendous collision on a

‘third-down reception, Dukes stepped in -to fill

the void.

Slaouldering the load

Chad Dukes‘ 109 rushing yards led the Panthers in their 42-21 loss at West Virginia.

West, Colicchio, Da/eesptc/e up for Martin

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

The senior rushed for 109 yards on 10 carries
—— a 10.9 average — while busting a 43-yard
run. Dukes was aided by the play of an improv-
ing offensive line but turned many small holes
into huge gains.

“It’s pleasing to see the backs come out there
and givean effort,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said.

“We have a lot of peopletrying very hard.
Mentally, we’re not playing as smart as we could
 but I think there are several players who are
trying very hard.”

Also seeing his first sizable playing time was
former starting running back Tim Colicchio. The

junior, who started in Martin’s stead last year, .

picked up 41 yards on nine carries and ran with
some of the same explosiveness that made the

The Pitt tennis team closed
its fall season with an impres-
sive showing this past weekend
at the Duquesne University
Invitational, led by. Braden
Doherty’s win in the top brack-
et. ‘

The invite consisted of‘ three
flights of singles and three
ﬂights of doubles. No team
points were awarded.

“This was the best showing
at a tournament by one of my
teams since we were second at
the Big East in 1985,” head
coach George Dieffenbach
said. 7

Doherty beat Greg Llewellyn
of Akron University 4-6, 6-2, 6-
3 to take the Flight A
Championship.

“Braden deserved to win the
championship,” Dieffenbach
said. A

“He’s worked very hard this
year, but he just wasn’t win-
ning like he was used to.”

Matt Mills was the Flight C

champion, beating Robert
Morris’ Greg Peluso 6-1, 6-1.
After losing in the first round,
Chris McShane came back to
win the Flight C consolation
championship with a 9-5 win
over Duquesne’s Jason Fuges.

In doubles Doherty teamed
with Brad Wade for a 7-6 (7-4),
6-2 win over SUNY Buffa1o’s
Matt Klein and Luis Gurri to
take the Flight A doubles
championship.

Pitt’s Jeff Campbell and James
Chronister beat Duquesne’s
Tom Kirk and Mike Sullivan 6-
4, 6-4 in the Flight B semifinals
and won the championship by
default when the Robert Morris
doubles team failed to show.

Dieffenbach was impressed
with ‘Campbell and Chronister’s
semifinals match calling it “the
best doubles play I’ve watched
by my players in many, many

years.”

Tennis notes: The ITC Rolex

  Trio

Continued from page.5
1992 Martin/Colicchio backﬁeld
one of the most potent duos in
the Big East. , ~

“I’m never pleased with my
performance, but right now I’m
trying to overcome injuries,”
Colicchio said. '

“I know I gotta step up now
and sell out the best I can. I
have to forget these injuries
and just play my hardest.”

“Colicchio ran hard  I have
a lot of respect for him,” Majors
said.

“He’s a terrific kid  he
works hard in practice, he
works hard on the kicking
game. He’s a tough young
man.”

Perhaps the biggest surprise
of the day was the play of

rookie Billy West. The frosh

rushed for two touchdowns on
four carries, including -a sprint
to the right corner to punch
home the Panthers’ first touch-
down.

“Billy West isn’t the biggest
guy or the fastest guy, but he is
quality all over,” Majors said.

 

“I’m very fond of him  if you
have more Billy Wests on the
squad, you’ll be fine.”

Despite his injury, Martin was
happy with the play of the trio
of backs.

“As a running back corps, we
work as one, and I have confi-
dence that if I’m not in, they’ll
get the job done just as if
they’re not in, they have confi-
dence that I’ll get the job
done,” he said.

“It’s not like we’re competing

- against each other, but every-

one wants to start.

"We’re so close that we’re
always rooting for each other,"
Martin added. '
