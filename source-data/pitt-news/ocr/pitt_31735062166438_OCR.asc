Senior Women

Win SC Posts

Because of an insufficient
number of candidates in some
student government areas,
sixteen students are assured
of victory in today’s elections
in the Common’s Room.

Thirteen of these students, how-
ever, are candidates for class
offices and therefore will have to
await the returns late tonight to
ﬁnd out the actual positions they
win.

In the senior women’s section
for Student Congress, incumbent
Betty Chiapetta, Helen Swift,
and Donna Goode are assured
of their positions.

Three senior class officer areas
have a shortage of candidates.

tion are (in no speciﬁc order)
Dennis Zymboly, Charles Dahl-
inger, Arny Landy, and Walter
Zimmerman. For engineering and
mines there are William Cook,
Richard Ney, and Patsy Pignoli.
Education ’58 has only two office-
seekers, Robert Watford and Ro-
bert Gibb.

Congress Absolves Coroso,
Suggests Central "Committee

By MILLARD AMDUR

Student Congress at the closing meeting of the present D

administration, Monday, April

8, in the French room of the

‘Student Union, recommended unanimously that COROSO be

absolved. I In a letter to Assistant Chancellor Peake, SC mem-
bers suggested that one central committee with similar ac-
tivities and functions to the Committee on Recognition of

Student Organizations be institut-0

ed within the framework of Stu-
dent Congress.

Congress members reasoned that
such a change would bind student
activities to student government.
It would also develop a bet-
ter system of communications
throughout the organizations’ sys-
tem. Finally, it would ensure the
permanence of small organizations
by continual checking on their
functions, activities, membership,
and officers.

Stan Goldberg, Col. ’59, as-
semblies chairman, presented a
resolution to Congress which
would, as he stated, promote a
“uniﬁed, co-ordinated assem-
bly program.” Any group which
desires to sponsor an open as-
sembly must clear the date with
the assemblies committee. This
will eliminate such conﬂicts as
Goldberg found this semester.

Morton_Wedner, chairman of the
blood drive, represented Arnold
Air Society in urging Student
Congress to grant their support
to the program which they did.
The blood drive will be held on
May 2, 3. '

Howard Rossen, appointments
committee chairman, announced
appointees for Homecoming 1957.
Tom Latimer, Bus. Ad. ’58, is
chairman, Robert Mendelson, Bus.
Ad. 59, business manager, and
Adam Sommerstein, Col. '59, was
selected publicity chairman.

ACTIVITIES

Registration for women’s ac-
tivities will take place all day
tomorrow on the twelfth ﬂoor.
Included are WSGA commit-
tees. class committees, and
some co-educational activities,

The Deciding Undecided

. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of their party.

Without a doubt, all those who are naturally associated
with the All~campus party, mostly fraternity men, and
those who are connected with the All-University party,
mostly independents, will vote for their party slates. They
are good men rallying to the aid of their party, which is the
ﬁber of any large electorate. ‘

But in any DEMOCRATIC elections the deciding factor

i should be those votes which split the ticket and select good

men from both parties. These votes are usually undecided
until election day. They are characteristically middle-of-the-
road and the appeal of both parties is extended to them since
they decide the election. *

The trouble with the student body at this University
when it comes to the election of student officers is that the

«only ones who take the time to vote are those who have

some direct aﬁiliation with the two “thought—groups” to
which the parties appeal.

The old-fashioned American mugwumper, with his mug
on one side of the fence and his wump on the other has
always been pushed and pulled by platform appeals until
he has ﬂopped into one party or another at least for a single
election. But at this University the anatomy of the fence-
sitter is slightly different. In order to keep his backturned
to the existence of student elections and student govern-

ment he is equipped with a wump at both ends. 

f you are one of the non-afﬁliated and still have a
head on your otherwise unburdened shoulders then use it
to advantage and take a few minutes to vote today. It’s less
painful than more incompetent student government.

Polaris Growing. Pains

‘ By Barbara Cherington _

Recently Polaris handbook was put under the
government of Student Congress. It is our hope
that the book will continue to be as convenient and
informative as it has been up to now.

It is certainly ﬁtting that the handbook should
come under the auspices of a men’s and women’s
combined organization because the material in-
cluded in the book‘ concerns all
students. Both men’s and wom-
en’s honoraries, social groups,
and professional organizations as
well as activities are listed and
described.

It is also ﬁtting that a man and
a woman share the editorship of
the book. B
;. The reasons are threefold: ex- A
pediency, democracy, and inter- ‘ ‘ . _
est. Because a woman will know more about wom-
en’s activities and groups than will a man, and be-
cause a male student will will know more about
men’s activities ‘and organizations, Polaris will
proﬁt from having both persons head its staff. As
simple asthat.
Equal Editors _

Second, as the interests of both are invested in
the handbook, both should have an equal share in
editing and publishing.

Third, the experiences of men and women work-
ing together and learning of the government of
each other in the various groups such as Men’s
Council and Women’s. Self Government Associa-
tion are of value.

The Careful Young Men . . .

    

Because of these reasons, the editorship of the
handbook though given over to the auspices of Stu-
dent Congress should be shared by the men and
women.

Past Selection Separate

In the past a woman editor was selected from
those applying at WSGA activities registration the
day after University elections. And the man co-
editor was selected by Men’s Council. Each of these
knew who their respective staff members were
from WSGA and MC. .

It has usually happened that the woman editor
was selected long before the person from MC, so
that work on the handbook would be delayed until
the partner’s place was ﬁlled. If such delay can.be
averted by the new control, so muchtthe better.

Changes have come about in the handbook in

the last couple of years. For instance, women’s andx. _

men’s activities used to be separate under the
former name of the book Vade Mecum.

This was found to be confusing to one seeking
information. For instance, if a personiwanted to
know about a certain honorary society's qualiﬁca-
tions, that person would have to look up the wom-
en’s section ﬁrst-and hunt for the particular or-
ganization.

Now, such groups are integrated in Polaris so
that a person need look up only the particular
group to ﬁnd its description.

If such improvements can be sustained andl

more innovated, the change is good. And the work
will be all the more exact with representation by
the man and woman co-editors.

logical source to exploit than
those most familiar with the sit-
uation, a representative group
of the students’ college teachers.
This self—styled “magazine for
intellectual leaders,” considered
by some too liberal, contacted
sixteen distinguished educators,
each from a different college. To
be completely equitable, the.
campuses are well-distributed
geographically and according to
size. Each professor was un-
aware of what his colleagues
were writing. b
Surprisingly enough, the re-
sults of the survey were signiﬁ-
cantly similar. All the pedagog-
ues seemed to agree that the
student of today is a “via media”
man, anxious to scan new hori-

\

, zons of knowledge, but not eas-

liy impressed by them. He is not
as likely to follow a new, fresh
writer as his parents were 25
years ago; attitude is, “wait and
see.”

. Letterslto the Editor-

Editor, The Pitt News:

With the advent of the new
administration, I have been pa-
tiently awaiting, almost with
anxiety, the ~improver_nent of
conditions in the Tuck Shop.
More speciﬁcally — I don’t mind
the noise that permeates this
natural habitat of frustrated in-
tellect, although at times the din
becomes deafening. Nor do I
mind all the glass, shattered on
the floor, broken due to inade-
quate space in which to move.
In the eatery, the long line that
is the result of insufficient aid
at the cash register is slightly
annoying, but this is, I imagine,

one of the shortcomings of ﬁn- «

ancial appropriations far from
realistic. .. -

Of course, with the prices that"

 

 

They don’t fall for propaganda
nor do they trust extremists. The
students, somewhat paradoxic-
regard themselves inde-
pendents, while maintaining this
attitude of conservatism. They
seek men who desire to ﬁnd out

the truth. If they become con- .

vinced of his ﬁrm and fearless
qualities, no matter what tag
society may pin on him, they’ll
listen to him and, logically, on
the basis of valid, reliable evid-
ence, judge him. The student
doesn’t care if the new truth
corresponds to the widely ac-
cepted one or not. If it does, no
damage is done.

They are serious, but not
solemn. According to Carlos

Baker, chairman of the English’

Department at Princeton, “They
can hoot at Elvis Presley and
other happy hotdogs with pleas-
ure.” They have sharp wits, love
pleasure, and are skillful at
getting into trouble. The college
youth regard the good things of
life too often only from a ma-
terial aspect, typical of the false

value placed on wealth in the a
“United States.

’ The students normally respect
the old and established more
readily than the new and un-
tried. Freund and Jung are cited
by all the professors inltheir re-
ports on student attitudes, as re-
spected individuals for uncov-
ering the human personality.

Faulkner Mentioned .

Faulkner, along‘ with Salinger,
rated mention by all the sixteen
educators. Students _admired Or-
well, Koestler, and Huxley, Sa-

exist, if this organization doesn’t
show a large proﬁt, I believe an
investigating committee some
what similar to that investigat-
ing the rackets, should be estab-
lished — its ﬁndings, I am sure,
would reveal gross mismanage-
ment.

I noted with awe and enthus-
iasm, that Chancellor Litchﬁeld
had grants of millions and mil-
lions of dollars available to him.
Great progress is in the offing,
so they tell us. But I wonder if
just .0001% of this impressive
budget could be directed to the
improvement of “atmospheric
conditions” in the Tuck shop.
Some would contend that ven-
tilation is _a better word, but this

. would be erroneous, Here lies
amy. objeqtion: I can’t breathe. It

that much in the world is bleak,
but does not advocate the cyn-
nic who leaves the reader with-
out a “glimmer of hope.”

It’s obvious, though, that no
fettish or shining example to the
great body of students exists.
There is no trend, but small
clots of studied interest. It was

agreed by everyone that stuff]
dents are attending college, for T,

the most part, in pursuit of “the
good, i the beautiful, or the
truth.” They attend because a
degree increases earning power.

As the professors. become
more and more specialized in a
particular ﬁeld, the students un-
der their tutelage in greater and
greater number desire only to
‘get by.” This makes for some
intellectual deterrioration. It is
little wonder that these students
don’t desire to go out on a limb
about anything. They’ve s e e n
what happened to those who did.
With the unexpressed fear of

V’

“war, the bomb, military serv-'

»ice,” they buy security for con-
formity.

On the other hand, with the

disadvantages that conformity
may have, it is “self-reliant and
sane.” Many periods in the his-
tory of the world have been
characterized by some type of

conformity. The professors agree "

that the students are talented,
industrious, and attractive, but
as one of the students’ favorite,
Niebuhr has described, they
grew up in a “paradise of do-
mestic security and growing
justice, suspended in a hell of
‘international insecurity.”

seemsthat some type of ventil-
ating system has been provided,
but where it is or why it re-
mains inoperative remains a my-
stery. The windows are ﬁrmly
anchored through disuse. The
temperature in this greenhouse
at times approaches 95 with a
corresponding rise in humidity.
This environment may be con-
ductive to swimming, but not to
eating. —

And now my plea — could
someone from the All-Univers-
it y, All-Campus, Nationalist,
Radical, or Left-Field Party,
provide a solution to the exist-
ing problem in their platform?-
To this personer party, I do
hereby solemnly pledge my vote.

Panthers To Try Again

If Weather

Cooperates.

By MURRAY CHASS ,
After their fourth consecutive rainout, the Panther nine

A will now play, or try to play, their lid-lifter at home against

the St. Vincent Bearcats today. The game at Mellon Field

will get underway at 3 p.m. v” V

‘ With the conglomeration of rain,
snow, and cold temperatures that
have prevailed the past week, it
is somewhat dubious that the Blue
and Gold will be successful in
starting their season today.

Instead they stand a better
chance of getting the opener out
of the way A =
this Saturday
at Lexington,
Va., w h e r e ‘
they will‘ play
a d o u  l e —

h e a d e r
against V i r -
ginia Military
Institute. _

N 0 m a t t e r
which team, the . , V
Bealrcats or the Lindstrom
Military or any _
other mitt squad, oﬁers the op-
position for the Panthers’ opener,
Coach Bobby Lewis’ mound ace,
Ronnie Moog, will be rarin’ to go.-

S Concerning the continuous lay-
offs, Moog says, “If we would
have played last week and then
had a lot of games rained out, it
would have hurt us more. I’m still
staying in shape, though. You can
never’ tell when a game is coming
up.” .

And as soon as Moog has his
turn senior Carl Lindstrom will
be ready to take the mound. In
one way or another Lindstrom,
whom Lewis feels can come up
with his best performance this
year, should meet his first test
Saturday.

Yesterday’s postponement with
California Teachers has been reset
for Monday, April 29. That will
give the Panthers four games in
five days, the only open date com-
ing on Sunday. A

week, only VMI hashad previous

  
  
   

Netmen Open

Witt: Indiana

Coach Ben Pope, successor
to Jim Tully who resigned to
take as similar post in Haver-
ford, Pa., faces a big task’ in
his ﬁrst season as head man
of the Panther tennis team.

Last year un.der the guidance of
Tully the Blue and Gold netmen
posted a 9-3 record, but the loss
of some promising freshmen will
make it difficult to improve on
this chart.

Coach Pope is couiiting heav-
ily on Herb Thompson as the
No. 1 man when the Jungle Cats
open the season with Indiana
Teachers on the latter’s court
tomorrow afternoon.

The big drawbackin the case of
Thompson, however, is the pros-
pect of not having him available
for all the matches because he is
attending Medical School.

Ping~Pong Unit Places Second

The Panther ping pong team, a
member of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Table Tennis League, ﬁn-
ished second in the ﬁrst half of

the schedule with a record of 5-3.,

The league consists-of ﬁve teams
from the Tri-rstate area. They are
South Park (7-1), the ﬁrst half
winner, plus Steubenville, Down-
town YMCA, and Carnegie Tech.

Although the Blue and Gold’
fell short in their quest for the
ﬁrst-half championship after
dropping their ﬁrst two matches,
they came on strong to win ﬁve
of their last six games.

One thing which has earmarked
the locals as a strong favorite for
second-half honors is some addi-
tional talent, notably Peter Con-
daris who played on the national
table tennis team of Greece.

Other players in order of their

ranking are Abbot Friedland, cap-A

tain of the team, Chuck Caffery,
Herbert Sroboritz, Sandy Cohen,
Milt Jacobs, Maurice Fried, and
Danny Jacobs.

The top three players intend to
enter the national tourney next
month. A

cTrackst‘ers Inaugurate

Campaign W ith Middies
By JOHN FAY

Highlighting the home track opener with Navy on Sat-
urday at the Stadium should be the clashes where the Panther
thinclads appear to be very strong with Herb Carper, who
last year ran a :09.4 over the 100—yard route, back to lead
the team’s speedsters. The meet begins at 12:30 p.m.

Jim Donahue, an outstanding sophomore runner with a

ﬁne record in this winter’s indooro

season, should give the Panthers
a strong dash duo. Another man
who showed great promise as a
freshman l a s t‘ y e a r, and who
rounds out the team’s entry in the
100—yard dash is Jay Moody.
Returning to the s t a r t i n g
blocks for the
2 2 0 - y a. r d
dash will be
C a r p e r,
Donahue, and
Moody. There
i s a g o o d 3
chance t h a t
a n o t h e r
s o p h o more,
Walt Talbert,
will break in-
to the lineup
in this event,

Moore

~ too.

In the 440—yard dash, Coach
Carl Olson will have four veter-
ans to choose from to ﬁll the three
starting positions. From this win-
ter’s showing, Dick Doyle seems
to be the No. 1 man over this dis-
tance. Charles Heﬂin and Ed
Saunders, both of whom com-
peted in the mile relay in- the
indoor season, will offer Doyle
support along with Perry Jones,
the speedy senior from New Jer-
sey.

As Coach Olson sees it now, Jim
Moore is the leading Panther in
the 880-yard run. Jones, who was
part of the Blue and Gold’s one-

“two punch in this event last year

along with Arnie Sowell, also will
compete in the ‘880’ again.
Coming up from the fresh-
man squad are Sam Grisciotti
and Zinnerford Smith, both of
whom are expected to run regu-
larly during the coming sea-
son. Wendell Harford, a senior
letterman and veteran from the
two-mile relay team, and John
Christoff round out the prob-
able starters in this event.

When the runners lineup for
the mile run, Moore and Harford
will be called upon to represent
Skyscraper U. in this grind. Join-
ing Moore and I-Iarford in the run
will be Thorton Smith and Vince
Timon, the very promising sopho-
more distance runner.

Smith, Timon, and Charles

 

James, another sophomore who
should see a good deal of service,
will be Coach Olson’s choices in
the two-mile run.

Although the Panthers lack
depth in the high hurdles, the
team should score a good num-
ber of points through the efforts
of Paul Thrash, last season’s
outstanding hurdler, and Regis
Goggin, a ﬁne sophomore pros-
pect.

Thrash will compete in the low
hurdles, too. Moody, Saunders, and
Heﬂin are Olson’s other selections
to run this event and thus round
out the lineup for the track events
against Navy.

Three Returnees
Boost Golf Hopes

Golf coach Dave McCormick,
commenting on the progress of his
team says, “I sure hope we soon
get a break in the weather. I
haven’t been able to get a good
look at the boys myself.”

Last year the Panther linkers
posted a 6-4 chart, and with the
addition of Ronnie Schwarzel of
Brentwood who was three-time
state scholastic champ, the local
golfers are looking forward to
improving on their 1956 record.

Dick Segal of Pittsburgh,
Dave Brown of Brownsville, and
Bill Reilly of Sharon are the
returning lettermen which
should form the nucleus of an-
other ﬁne team for Coach Mc-
Cormick.
