Area Greeks discuss
changes for the '90s

By Karen D. Speece

Staﬂ“ W1-iters
Leadership, goal setting,

communication, ability to change
and proper risk management will
keep fraternities from becoming
extinct, said Bob Bainey,
Northeastern Inter-Fraternity
Council chairperson, during his
keynote address at the NEIFC
conference on Saturday.

The conference, held in the
William Pitt Union, hosted
representatives of fraternities from
several area schools. During the
conference these representatives
had the opportunity to attend
seminars which addressed current
issues facing the Greek system
and to hold discussions on
different ways their problems

could be solved.

“Fraternities are changing all
the time. My purpose today is to
talk about getting the most out of
your fraternity experience,”
Bainey said.

“It can be done, but we've got
to plan. We’ve got to put [our
goals] down in writing and
constantly review what we're
trying to accomplish," Bainey
continued. He encouraged the
members to think big, enroll the
help and support of all the
brothers in their fraternities,
establish a mission statement and
do an audit or review each year.

Bainey cited an example of an
assistant football coach who had
just lost his job. Instead of feeling
down on himself and giving in,
he got out a ledger pad and

PPC seminar increases students’ health awareness

By Tammy Poole
Staff Writer

In an effort to make students more
aware of their physical, emotional and
psychological health, the Protect Yourself
seminar was held on Friday.

The seminar featured ﬁve workshops,
four videos, and 19 representatives from
various campus organizations, nearby
hospitals and institutions.

“I tried to create a wide range of programs
that students would be interested in or
have questions about," saidjodi Gagliardi,
Pitt Program Council’s director of leisure
learning. PPC organized the seminar.

One of the groups represented at the
seminar was the Pittsburgh Men’s Collective
Organization. The purpose of the

organization is to give men the opportunity
to talk openly about their public and
private lives.

“We are here to emphasize the way in
which our organization tries to create a
world for men to feel free to be whatever
they want to be,” said Todd Erkel, a
member of the organization and a senior
writer for Pitt Magazine.

“If a man wants to be a gay man, that’s
fine. if they want to be a man who cries,
that’s fine. If they want to be a school
teacher, instead of an accountant for a big
ﬁrm, that’s fine also. We support that. He
shouldn’t feel like any less of a man
because he is not what society wants him
to be," Erkel said.

Mary Litrnan, public-relations director at
Women’s Health Services in downtown

Pittsburgh, said her facility tries to remind
women that good health care is essential
on a number of levels.

“Although Women’s Health Services is
the largest abortion provider in the area,
we do provide other health care for women
and really like to inform them about birth
control as well as responsible decision
making,” said Litrnan.

Litrnan said that she felt lucky to have
found a job where her personal beliefs can
be validated.

“I had an illegal abortion when I was 20
years old, and I was one of those classic
cases where I almost died because it was
illegal,” she said. “It gives me a personal
satisfaction on the days that we do an
abortion that I walk through the clinic and
see women getting good health care.”

Sgt. Charles Grier of the Community
Relations Crime Prevention Unit attended
the seminar to speak with students about
date rape on campus. Grier said that it is
always important to stress that date rape is
a crime and that a woman has a right to her
body.

“Our talks always focus on the behaviors
that an individual can [use] to resist
becoming an victim of date rape,” Grier
said.

Grier said his information is not only
directed toward the female audience but
toward the male audience also.

“Both males and females are victims of
date rape; however, 99.9 percent of the
time, the victim is the female,” he said.

Universities need to address

By Leo Hoh
For The Pitt News

The harassing effects of racial
slurs were discussed at “Campus
Responses to Racial Harassment
and Intimidation," a
teleconference held Friday in the
William Pitt Union.

“Words are the weapons by
which one inﬂicts pain on others
these days,” said Blandina
Cardenas Ramirez, a panelist on
the satellite conference from New
Orleans.

Other panelists were Robert M.
O'Neil, Dudley D. Woodard }r.,
and Beverly E. Ledbetter.

Ramirez, director of the Office
of Minority Concerns for the
American Council on Education,
deﬁned racial harassment as those
words and actions that ‘devalue
your cultural identity, your sense
of being.”

“You're not only hurting the

individual but the totality of
creation which brought you to
be," she said.

The effects of racial harassment
are easily seen in the minority
community, said Ledbetter, vice
president and general council for
Brown University. Minority
students come to campus with
the sense of belonging; when
racial harassment occurs, it
devalues them personally and
reduces their value to participate
fully in campus life, she said.

The reason that racial
harassment is increasing across
American campuses is the lack of
a national spirit, said Woodard, a
professor of higher education at
the University of Arizona.

“In the ’60s our generation
worked for a unifying cause, a
greater goal; and in the '80s, all
the student cares about is material
goods and self-gratiﬁcation,” he
said. Woodard also said that as

females and minorities move up
the professional ladder, white
males are steadily losing their
self-identity and job security. This
type of change quickly can lead
to violence on the white males’
part against the minority, he said.

Woodard believes that a great
amount of racial violence could
be avoided if college ofﬁcials
helped white male students
accommodate to this kind of
change.

As racial tension increases
across American campuses, more
and more administrators are
making plans to deal with racial
harassment.

According to the 1990 Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching report titled
“Enhancing Campus
Community," 60 percent of all
institutions have a written policy
governing racial harassment
Twenty-three percent of the

institutions did not possess such
a policy, and 11 percent were in
the process of writing one.

Panelists said some
administrators are cautious to
write such a policy because it
may infringe upon the individual’s
freedom of speech.

O’Neil, founding director of
the Thomas Jefferson Center for
the Protection Of Free Expression,
said, “Universities may have to
go to court to have their policies
tested for constitutionality, but
that should not shy the education
community from developing
these types of policies.

‘If we truly believe that these
are the standards that must be
maintained in order to protect
every student's right to a decent
education, we must stand up to
this challenge and take that risk,”
he said.

The panelists offered their
suggestions on ways to ease racial

‘devaluing’ eﬁ’ects of racism

tensions on campus:

0O’Neil said that the university
ought to require special courses
in foreign cultures.

oWoodard said the university
must teach its students the history
of racism. Universities should also
provide more opportunities for
the students of divine cultures to
get to know each other and
understand our differences.

-Ramirez said the university
not only has to support minorities
on campus and encourage their
culture, but also make them feel
like they are part of the larger
learning community.

-Ledbetter said, “A campus
needs to have that positive
environment that allows the
educational system to function at
its best. Minority students need a
greater sense of support from
administrators that racial
harassment will not deny them

their full campus experience.”

Socialists callfor Pitt to oppose U.S. imperialism

By Randy Legersky

sum‘ Writer

College campuses need to
mobilize to oppose U.S.
involvement in the Middle East,
according to Helen Halyard,
assistant national secretary of the
Workers’ Revolutionary League.

“We're ﬁghting for the working
class in the United States to lead
the anti—war movement We call
on students here to ‘turn their
attention to the industrial
proletariat and to ﬁght within the

working class for the building of '

a revolutionary leadership, to arm
the working class with a new
perspective and to arm the
working class with a new
program," said Halyard.

“A resolution should be taken
into the student [government] at
Pitt to demand that the student
[government] vote on a resolution
condemning the action of U.S.
imperialism and calling for the
withdrawal of all the American
military forces from the Persian
Gulf," said Halyard.

Halyard spoke on Wednesday

at a meeting of The Workers’
Revolutionary League and Young
Socialists at the YWCA
downtown.

“Iraq remains a I repressed
country economically dominated
and exploited by imperialism.
The American working class must
defend Iraq and oppose the
military intervention of American
imperialism. Our enemy is not
the Iraqi masses of people but
American corporations and the
banks and their political front
men and stooges like [President]
George Bush," said Halyard.

D’Artagnan Collier, national
secretary of the Young Socialists,
and Paul Scherrer, assistant
national secretary for the Young
Socialists, gave speeches focusing
on what they considered to be
America's imperialism as the
driving force in the Persian Gulf
crisis.

Scherrer said that right now the
U.S. government is conducting
its biggest military build up since
the Vietnam War.

“Youth are being sent to either
kill orbe killed in order to beneﬁt

the needs of the Wall Street
bankers, the oil monopolies and
the military machine which will
make millions of dollars off this
war. We say categorically that the
Arab workers and youth are not
our enemies, that our enemies
are in fact the Wall Street
corporations, the military machine
and this government. Our slogan
is not a dime, not a drop of blood
for an imperialist war,” said
Scherrer.

“The current war is not the U.S.
response to the [Iraqi] invasion
but it is in fact the outcome of a
long-standing drive of U.S.
imperialism for the establishment
of permanent military bases in
the Middle East and for its
domination over the control of
oil resources," said Scherrer.

“The aim today [of the United
States] is the re—establishment of
direct colonial rule over the
people not only of Iraq but
throughout the entire Middle East,
Africa, Asia and South America.”

Collier spoke on the support
that young people have given the
socialist cause.

“Thousands of working-class
youth have purchased copies of
The Bulletin and The Young
Socialist over the last several
weeks. Young people have
expressed their distrust and
resentment that many social
programs, including college
education and public education,
are being gutted in order to
finance the war. In Detroit the
board of education has plans to
close down over a 100 schools in
the next ﬁve years, and already
16 have been shut down,” said
Collier.

Collier said that the Bush
administration is hypocritical in
its presentation of foreign policy.

“If the Bush administration is
so concerned about ﬁghting for
democracy and restoring
legitimate regimes, why doesn’t
the U.S. government send troops
to South Africa to assist the black
working class in overthrowing
the apartheid regime and place
the political power in the hands
of the vast majority instead of a
handful of white capitalists?” said
Collier.

Anthropology professor strives to make learning fun

By Tonia Caruso
For The Pitt News

It's 11:15 a.m. on Tuesday. An
eruption of laughter comes from
behind the closed doors to Room
120 David Lawrence Hall. Inside
are 400 students stricken with the
giggles and up on the stage, the
man responsible.

This man is Richard Scaglion,
Ph.D., and the class is Introduction
to Cultural Anthropology.

“Learning can be fun or at least
painless,” said Scaglion, the
associate professor and associate
chairperson of the anthropology
department.

“There’s no reason why you
can’t enjoy yourself and joke a
little.”

If Scaglion ever wanted to give
up his anthropological career,
perhaps he could get a job as Phil
Collins’ stand—in.

“There was a time about five
years ago when I thought I looked
exactly like Phil Collins. But he
has changed a lot,” said Scaglion.
“He has gotten really fat and
really, really bald. I have too of
course, but just not so much,” he
said. A

Scaglion said he can also see
his similarity to Gene Hackman.
“Especially in the ‘French
Connection’ days. I also think I
look a lot like Bill Murray. Bill
Murray acts more like me,” said
Scaglion. “One of the things they
always ask you in the newspaper
is: ‘Who would play you in the
movies?’ For me, it would be a
combination of Gene Hackman
and Bill Murray.”

Scaglion admitted he took his
first anthropology course because
it filled a requirement.

"1 was enrolled as a math major
at LaFayette College when
somehow along the way I got
exposed to anthropology and saw
the light, ” Scaglion said “I realized

I had always been interested in
anthropology; I just didn’t know
what it was.”

Scaglion, who came to Pitt ‘s
graduate school in 1969, said he
has always been interested in
other people and cultures.

“I think everyone in the world
has real worth. You can learn
something from everyone. I like
sharing this with my students,”
he said.

“lscaglionl makes you want to
go to class because you don’t just
sit there and take notes,” said
junior, Frank Paletta. “He gets
you involved by telling lots of
stories and jokes.”

Many of Scaglion’s stories come
from his ﬁeldwork experiences
with the Abelam people of Papua,
New Guinea.

“I love working with the Abelam
because I'm about the tallest
person around,” the 5~foot, 6-
inch anthropologist said. “In our
society, I'm considered to be
small, but among the Abelam I’m
a giant. They’re always making
jokes about how tall I am. I never

have to worry about bumping
my head in America but I smash
my head up all the time over
there because I’m not used to
being so big.”

Scaglion said he’s learned a
whole different attitude about
life from the Abelam.

“You begin to realize that your
culture’s way of thinking about
the world is just one of many, and

less ethnocentric. If all people in
the world would have a bit more
understanding for others, the
world would be a much better
place,” said Scaglion. “I think it’s
my sacred mission in life to try
and open the eyes of all the Pitt
undergrads who will soon be
going out into the real world. I

part."

“It’s easy to ~ learn from Dr.
Scaglion,” said junior Armando
Sciullo. “He’s funny, enjoys his
work and likes his students.”

Scaglion said knowing that
students enjoy his class is the
most gratifying thing about
teaching. “When students who
are not just trying to get a good
grade tell me they really enjoyed
the class or got something out of
it I feel good,” said Scaglion.

In 1984, Scaglion won the
Chancellor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award.

professionally, winning ihﬁ awa r (l

has made me the proudest. I won ,

the award the first time it was

because it came largely from the

Currently, Scaglion is teaching
two graduate courses along with
the introductory class. He
describes one of the courses as “a

began writing down everything
he wanted to do in his lifetime.

When he was done, his list
contained 107 goals including
meeting the president, visiting all
seven continents, getting a hole
in one, being on the Johnny
Carson show, and winning a
football championship as the head
coach of a Division I football
team. Lou Holtz, head coach of
Notre Dame, has since then
accomplished many of his goals.

Running each fraternity like a
business will also help fraternities
survive, according to Bainey. He
asked his audience to think about
how their brothers answered the
phones, how they dressed, how
they conducted themselves and
how long they took to respond to
letters from alumni and the public.
Bainey said that a more
professional, businesslike attitude
will help make a good impression
on people who are leery of the
Greek system.

“We need to be thinking about
where we’re headed in two, three,
four years, and within that, how
can we prepare for that by using

fraternity as a vehicle for that
goal?” Bainey said. Taking
calculated risks, getting to know
people, developing new plans,
planning ahead and establishing
long-range planning committees
which include alumni will help in
this preparation, according to
Bainey.

“Look at your fraternity as a
microcosm of what society is all
about," Bainey said. “Watch your
time  spend some quality time
with your brothers.” Bainey
advised the participants to “get to
know their publics,” which he

' said includes the mayor, the media

and [officials at their] national
headquarters, among others.
Bainey encouraged the brothers
to get to know what sororities
want to do socially, sell
themselves, repeat their good
ideas and maintain a balance in
their lives.

“If Billy Joel were here, what
would be his words [to ‘We Didn't
Start the Fire’l? If it was the year
2000, what would be the words
that would go with the next
decade, and how are we going to
be a part of those words?” Bainey

asked. “Don't worry about your
failures. Worry about the chances
you miss when you don’t even
try,” he said.

A discussion of the Fraternity
Insurance Purchasing Group
given by Bainey introduced a
new insurance program which is
being adopted by fraternities and
sororities, nationally and
internationally. Under this
program Greeks are better able
to cover their liabilities.

Currently, about 33 of the 59
national fraternities are covered
by this plan, and a majority of the
remainder have similar policies.
A few sororities have also adopted
this plan. Bainey said he considers
this trend to be an indication of
what may be necessary in the
future to properly insure Greek
organizations because FIPG
covers all aspects of risk
management.

A Greek Week session was
conducted by Brent Saunders,
NEIFC vice president and IFC
internal vice president at Pitt, and
Bob Williams, Greek Week
business manager at Pitt. This
session focused on how to have

a successful Greek Week.

“It's a business; we run it as a
business,” Williams said. Most
people don’t realize that the cost
of a Greek Week is about $35,000,
according to Williams.

The most important element in
Greek Week is getting good
sponsors because the only Greek
Week event that raises money is
the Dance Marathon. The other
source of funds is canning, which
Williams said is illegal without a
permit. He also said that only one
permit may be issued . for a
particular cause.

The rest of the Greek Week
events are held for _fun and to
promote friendly competition.
Williams said that the main reason
why some Greek Weeks are not
successful is that they lose sight
of their philanthropic goal and
focus instead on rivalry.

seminar on hazing. She

major, so I have a great concern
for health services. The
representatives 0 were able to
provide me with essential
material, ” said sophomore Steven
Walker.

Gagliardi said she thought the
seminar went well and calculated
that there were at least 400
students in attendance.

“I estimated this many students
because Student Health Services
[was] giving out free key chains
to students, provided that they
fill out a question on a small
sheet of paper. There were about
400 sheets of paper when I last
counted,” said Gagliardi. “I was
very pleased at the outcome.”

and then to reﬂect on their
initiation rituals and determine
how well they measure up to
their principles.

Bob Curry, NEIFC executive
director, addressed membership
development. “When I think
about Greeks, I think about three
things. I think about when I open
the newspapers — some of that’s
good; some of that’s bad. I think
about risk reduction and
violations for dumb things that
happen, [and] I think of John
Belushi’s Animal House,” Curry
said.

Curry asked the audience to
imagine fraternities as a large pie
and asked what the slices would
be. Pledging, scholarship,
philanthropy, alumni, sports,
other activities and social
functions were determined to be
major components or slices of
the pie.

“People are being called to
task now, and that is going to be
a big challenge for [Greeks] to get
good membership-education
programs for your new brothers,”
Curry said. A

3 Obscenity is personal choice

U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez defined obscenity for
the state of Florida on June 6. Now a man is going to jail
for believing the First Amendment of the Constitution
overrides Gonzalez’ decision.

Gonzalez ruled that the album As Nast)/As They Wanna
Be by 2 Live Crew was obscene. He also decided that this
album could not be sold in the state of Florida.

Two days after Gonzalez’s ruling Charles Freeman sold
a copy of the controversial record to undercover police
officers in his E-C Record Store in Fort Lauderdale.
Freeman was subsequently arrested for selling obscene
material. In July the lead singer of 2 Live Crew was
arrested in Fort Lauderdale for performing songs from the
album.

When the decision came down, Freeman openly
challenged the statement, saying that he would sell the
album anyway. He believed that any attempt to restrict the
music he sold was a violation of the First Amendment.

Last week Freeman was convicted on this charge. He
faces up to oneﬁyear in jail and a $1,000 fine.

During the trial Broward County Judge Paul Backman
gave jurors the right to decide whether or not the album
was obscene yet refused to give them copies of the lyrics,
which many couldn’t understand because of a poor sound
system.

Backman was correct in his decision to let the jurors
decide for themselves. However, they shouldn’t have
been the only people to make that decision.

The judgement of obscenity should be a personal one.
Juries should not have to decide on it. Judges should not
have the authority to rule on it. The public should have
the right to decide for itself.

Charles Freeman should never have been brought to
trial. He was right in his decision to let the public decide
for itself.

Because of the publicity surrounding the album sales of
As Nasty As They Wanna Be have skyrocketed because
people want to hear the lyrics and make their own
personal decisions. They should have the ability to do
this, regardless of what any one judge says.

Ironically, Florida, namely Fort Lauderdale and Daytona,
is an annual haven for college students on spring break,
who tend to be more obscene than any album could ever
be. This contradictory policy toward obscenity shows that
any one person’s definition of it cannot be omniscient.

Helms sponsoring high prices

College marks the time when
many students start purchasing
clothing with their own money. . ..

But very few people ever ask
why clothing is so expensive.
Well, one reason is because of
various trade barriers that the
U.S. federal government has
imposed.

The federal government has
very strict import quotas which
limit the amount of clothing that
can be imported into the United
States every year. Once a quota

‘\ has been reached for a particular

type of clothing, it is illegal to
import any more of that type of
clothing into the country for the
rest of the year.

Because the supply of foreign
clothing is limited, its price goes
up. Furthermore, because there
is less competition, American
clothing also becomes more
expensive.

Every year, U.S. citizens pay
approximately $27 billion in
higher clothing prices because
of U.S. trade barriers. That
amounts to. an average of $108
per person.

And guess what? Sen. Jesse
Helms (R.-N.C.) is sponsoring a
bill that will make this amount
even higher!

import quotas and make clothing
even more expensive than it is
now.

Helms has one basic argument
to support his bill: It will create
jobs in the U.S. clothes-
manufacturing industry.

What Helms says is certainly
true. However, there are other
things which he does not say.

For example, if Americans have
to pay more for clothing, then

 

T Daniel
Alman

they will spend less on other
things, and jobs will be destroyed
in those areas.

Furthermore, if we import less
clothing from other nations, then

The Textile, Apparel and those nations will have less money
Footwear Trade Act of 1990, if withwhich to purchase American
passed, would toughen up the manufactured goods. This too

Intramural soccer is run poorly

After seeing the letter “Filing
nails while we pay” (The Pitt
News, Oct. 1), I decided to pen
my complaints about our
university’s intramural depart-
ment. l...l This year my roster
was never returned, and I did
not receive a schedule of game
dates. I finally decided to call the
intramural office and I was told
[to] come pick up a schedule.
After I retrieved my schedule, I
discovered that my team had
. already missed two games.That
day I talked to another team
captain (sic) in my league and
|found that his team had also

0

missed those two games. Neither
of us was contacted by the
intramural department in any way.

Letters

So, I called the person in charge
of the soccer intramural league.
He said the schedule had been
changed as a result of the football
team's practice, but that we were
scheduled to play on Sept. 25.
When my team and I arrived at
the stadium Tuesday night, we
discovered that there were no

will destroy jobs.
The job gain which Helms
speaks of will be concentrated in

one industry: clothes
manufacturing. Thus, it will be
very visible.

The job loss, however, will be
spread out among many different
industries, and thus, itwill be less
noticeable.

In North Carolina, there is a
large Sl9ill§§=lll§illl.f§SE9illl£
industry. Helms hopes that by
“creating” jobs in his home state,
he will have a better chance of
getting re-elected.

Of course, Jesse Helms doesn’t
care about all the jobs that his bill
will destroy. Furthermore, he
doesn’t care if people, particularly
those living in poverty, have
difﬁculty in being able to afford
clothing.

But the real issue of import
quotas goes beyond economics.
Import quotas take away some of
our freedom.

If somebody wishes to purchase
a particular amount of clothing
from another country, then he or
she should be permitted to do so.
By setting quotas on this, the
government is taking away some
of our freedom to choose how to
spend our money.

Daniel Alman is a columnist
forThe Pitt News.-

referees and no representative
from the intramural department.
The next day I spoke with Marilyn
Ross, co-director of intramurals
and recreation. She told me that
we were not supposed to play
Tuesday night. L. .l She confirmed
that my team was to play on
Thursday, Sep. 27, and that
referees and an intramural
department representative would
be present. Again I showed up
with a team, and again there
were no referees or repre-
sentatives from the intramural
department. l...l

the second quarter.

Several fans still cooking out in a Three Rivers
Stadium parking lot (because they could not score any
scalpers’ tickets and make the game) said after
yesterday's Steelers-Chargers game that they had heard
the loudest cheer ever explode from the inside the
stadium’s concrete confines less than one minute into

Hallelujah...

Steelers‘ ofensive drught end with fouTD victory

For those of us inside the stadium, that deafening
cheer resulted from Bubby Brister’s eight—yard
touchdown pass to rookie tight end Eric Green. It was
the first TD pass for Brister this season and Green’s first
professional score. More importantly, it was the
Pittsburgh Steelers‘ first offensive touchdown of the
season. And it wasn’t the last either.

The Steelers went on to score three more TDs on the
afternoon en route to a 36-14 victory in front of 53,486

ecstatic fans.

 

First-round draft pick Eric Green scores the first oﬂensive touchdown of the season for the Steelers; an eight-yard strike from Bubby Brister early in the second quarter.

“There’s no question we needed this one [win] for
everybody’s psyche —— for our fans, our press, not to 1
mention coaches and players. It was a game where I
thought we had an outstanding effort in all areas,” head
coach Chuck Noll said.

The rookie Green accounted for two Steeler scores —
the first on the eight-yard reception and the second on
a one—yard catch late in the second quarter. After
Green’s lengthy hold—out, there was much questioning

Women's Cross Country

The Pitt women’s cross country
team had runners place first
through fourth and dominated
the Pittsburgh City Championships
Saturday at Schenley Park.

Pitt scored 19 points and
defeated Duquesne University
(47) and Carnegie Mellon
University (62). Robert Morris
College was unable to field
enough runners to qualify for
team scoring.

Stacey Wyzykowski led the pack
of Pitt runners and won the race
in 18 minutes, 9 seconds, followed
by Laura O’Donnell, second
(18:29); Carmella Marianni, third
(19:06); Crystal Corle, fourth

have field day at Weekend tournaments

(19:21), and Chris Carnevali, ninth

(20:16).
“The team really came
through,” Wyzykowski said.

“Everyone ran a good time,
especially Laura. She was on my
tail most of the way.”

Besides one Duquesne runner
who challenged Corle at the
ﬁnish, Wyzykowski, O’Donnell,
Marianni and Corle were left to
themselves for most of the race.

One shadow over Saturday’s
meet was the absence of one of
Pitt’s top runners, Jen Hrauck.
Because of an eligibility problem,
Hrauck has been unable to
compete so far this season. She
was expected to be eligible for
Saturday’s meet, and the fact that
she wasn’t is frustrating to Lear.

“It’s amazing to me that she’s
still ineligible,” he said. “Every

week we’re told that she’s going
to have her eligibility back at the
end of the week, and then
something else pops up. She's
been cleared by the NCAA and
by another athletic committee
we have here. Now she has to go
before some senate committee.
It’s a shame because she’s losing
her season.”

The Lady Panthers’ next meet
will be the Big East
Championships at St. John’s
University in New York. The
competition will be very tough
up front since the top three Big
East teams — Providence,
Villanova and Georgetown —
are also among the top 10 teams
in the country.

But while those teams are
battling it out for the title, Pitt will
be taking its best shot at a fourth-

fifth— or sixth-place finish.

“They've had some tough meets
so far," Lear said. “They ran a
tough field at Penn State, and
down in West Virginia they barely
lost to Bucknell. Now we can get
in some good work in the next
two weeks and see what we can
do.”

Men's Cross Country

Keith Dowling placed first at
the Notre Dame Invitational
Saturday and led the men’s cross
country team to a second—place
finish over a ﬁeld of 20 teams.

Eighth-ra nked Notre Dame won
the meet with 40 points, followed
by Pitt (104), the University of
Virginia (115), the University of
Wisconsin, Oshkosh (146) and
Edinboro University (175).

“I feel’. good about it,” said
Coachjim Lear. “We beatvirginia,
who's a good team, and we also
beat some smaller schools who
were also good.”

Those smaller schools include
Oshkosh and Edinboro, which
have won their respective
divisions for the past few years.

Dowling won the race in 25
minutes, 4 seconds, and Jim
Hamilton finished 13th for Pitt in
26:01. Scott Humphrey was 17th
(26:14); Mike Formica was 25th
(26:31), and Pete Beehler was
48th.

“Pete Beehler did a real good
job,” Lear said. “We needed a
fifth man, and he was able to do
real well. And the other four guys
ran well, obviously. We finished
four in the top 25, and there were

as to how effective he would be
in his ﬁrst few outings.

Noll said that Green is a bright
individual who doesn’t make
mistakes, and that is the reason
he is playing so early after just
having been signed.

“I thank my coaches for really
having the conﬁdence and letting
me be in there because if they
didn't have that conﬁdence, I
wouldn’t have been in the position
I was in today,” Green said
graciously.

“I really studied the playbook.
I had a week to prepare. I really
studied it to prepare because I
want to be the bestl canbe at this
level,” he added.

The Steelers were not the best
they could have been lineup-
wise yesterday due to injuries.
Cornerback-kickoff-punt-return
man Rod Woodson sustained a
bruised thigh on a kickoff; running
back Tim Worley sprained his
ankle, and Brister wound up with
bruised ribs, giving rise to backup
QB Rick Strom.

Strom entered the game with
2:17 remaining in the second
quarter and turned in a respectable
performance the rest of the way.
He went seven for 11 for 68 yards

with no TDs or interceptions.

Regardless of who was on the
ﬁeld at any particular point in
time, it was not key individual
players who accounted for the
Steelers’ offensive explosion but
rather a well-executed game plan
by 11 men, according to Noll.

“There are many ways to do
things, but the one ingredient
that you need is blocking and
tackling and extra-hard running,
and we got that. You have X’s
and O’s all you’ want, but what
you need is people to knock
[other] people on their fanny,
and we got that. We got good
execution and they [players]
should be proud,” Noll said.

And speaking of a team effort,
ﬁve running backs had their crack
on the ﬁeld; seven different
players caught passes; four took
their turns at returning punts and
kickoffs, and two defenders
shared interception rights for the
Steelers.

Pittsburgh’s offensive numbers
were phenomenal on the
afternoon. Twenty-five first
downs, 376 total yards (185
rushing, 191 passing), a seventy-
ﬁve percent third down efﬁciency
rating, four touchdowns and no
interceptions.

The Steelers started their scoring
onslaught early. Gary Anderson
hit a 45-yard field goal, capping a
12-play, 52-yard drive early in the
first quarter to give the Steelers
an early 3-0 lead. But the Chargers
came right back on their next
drive when Billy Joe Tolliver hit
Gary Plummer, a linebacker by
trade, with a two-yard strike.

Green’s two touchdowns
accounted for all the scoring in
the second quarter as the Steelers
took a 17-7 lead into the locker
room.

In the third quarter, after
Dwayne Woodruff picked off a
Tolliver pass and returned it to
the San Diego 15-yard line,
Warrren Williams went around
the left side for a two yard
touchdown to put the Steelers up
24-7. But only minutes later,
Williams fumbled in his own end
zone, and the ball was recovered
by nose tackle Les Williams for
the Charger score.

A blocked punt by Tyronne
Stowe for a safety, another
Anderson ﬁeld goal and a Barry
Foster TD culminated all the
scoring that was to be done.

And in a gesture that certainly
had its time and place today,

Down a man, soccer
team preserves tie

By Christopher Block
Staff Wt-iter

Despite playing a man short
for almost 10 minutes, the Pitt
Panther soccer team held off a
late offensive surge by the St.
John’s Redmen last Saturday
night, preserving a scoreless
tie in New York.

The game started out slowly,
with each team making
sporadic attacks at each other.
In the second half both teams
seemed to settle down, and
the defense began to take
control.

The ‘ game remained a
defensive struggle for much of
the second half. With under 10
minutes left in the game, Pitt’s
Ted Noethling was given a red
card for rough play. Since a
red card means automatic
ejection, the Panthers would
have to continue the game
down by one man.

Playing 10 on 11, the Pitt
defense, buoyed by the play
of goalkeeper Tim Sobelman
and stopper Brian Pelligrino,
played extremely well.

Sobelman deﬂected a ball
late in the game to preserve
the tie and bring Pitt’s season
record to 3-5-1, finally
terminating its abysmal road
trip. The Panthers went a
disappointing 1-3-1.

After the game Sobelman
was proud of his teammates as
they kept the ball out of the
Pitt net despite being down a
man.

“I felt that the whole defense
played well. Nick [Liberatil was
strong; he marked St. John’s
best player and kept him out
of the game."

Defenseman Roberto Croce
said, “The defense was keeping
everyone in check. We had a
good effort against St. John's.

“It was a very unsatisfying
road trip, but yesterday was
the start of something good. In
practice this week, we
concentrated on ball control,
and it really helped us in this
game,” added Croce.

He continued, “Sobelman
came up big for us at the end
of the game. He probably
saved the game for us.”

Steelers——

Continued from page 12
Steeler offensive coordinator Joe
Walton was given the game ball.
Walton’s offense has come under
recent scrutiny by players and
the media, not to mention fans,
but it was his day to steal the
spotlight in an offensive rout.

“All week long we've been
talking about the type of people
we have working this offense,”
said Steeler wide reciever Louis
Lipps. “There's no reason why
we shouldn't be playing the way
we’re capable of. I think for him
[Walton] to see us go out there

and score points and make things

happen was a big feat for him.”
Who knows, maybe things will

turn out rosy for Joe after all.
But there’s always next week.
