anding participant in
studentvactivities, named the winner of the Pepper Prize at tapping

and an . outst

morning. The Pepper Prize is ‘the

award made each year to the most representative student in the Univer-

to be made, the fund having been

withdrawn by George Wharton Pepper, the donor.

“Eddie” Schultz
Is Named Winner
2   Of Pepper

_ Edward Schultz, who furnishes deﬁnite proof that it is
entirely possible to be both an athlete and a scholar, provided
one.is ‘endowed with sufficient ambition and energy. has been
selected byhis fellow students as the most representative Pitt

 

V . Schultz, known to everybody aboutpthe campus as “Eddie,”
will be awarded. today the George Wharton Pepper prize, an
honor that has been conferred upon only nine other Pitt stu-

dents, for display of leadership,"
scholarship and character.

In presenting Schultz with the
prizeth-is morning at the Tap as-
sembly, Dean Robert C. Clothier will
also announce that former Senator
Pepper has; decided to discontinue
the award after this year. The prize
wasﬁrst given in 1921 and in addi-

surrounded, an honorarium of $100
is also attached to it. “

"Eddie” will graduate in June
with a grade card that looks as
though it were marked by some one
who didn’t know the alaphabet be-
yond:A. In addition he will also
take with him the varsity football
“P.” With this record, “Eddie”
should be allowed to laugh when
any bombastic sports writer men-
tions overemph-asis and reforms in
college athletics.
There are many students who
probably are unaware of the fact
that “Eddie” was in many ways a
main cog in the Panther football
team for three years. Schultz
playedin few games, nor did he
stay long when he did play, but on
the--word of Coach Jock Sutherland,
himself, no, man has ever contrib-
uted more to the success of the
squad than he. '

_ Older Student

“Eddie” is older than most mem-
bers_of the June graduating class
and is also the oldest student to re-
ceive the Pepper prize. He is 31,
having been born in Pittston, Pa.,
October, 1900. But his life has been
an active one, ﬁlled with tragedy,

gan of the campaign wil be sta-
tioned at all prominent places on
the campus, including Alumni Hall,
State Hall, Thaw Hall, Cafeteria,
Dental and Medical Buildings, and
the Gymnasium.

The Student Loan Fund began in
1925. Throughout its whole career,
it has been very helpful to needy
students to men as well as to wom-
en. Their money has not depended
upon any endowments by the fac-
ulty but has all been obtained by
beneﬁts. At first bridges were held,
until the scope was widened to the-
ater parties, and just this last se-
mester, a Hallowe’en dance. Tag
Day has been an annual event.

The total amount of the eighty-
four loans’ that have been made, has
been $5,966.50. At present forty-ﬁve
loans amounting to $12,870.00 are
held. This year, alone, nineteen
loans, amounting to $1,145.00 were
granted.

To obtain a loan, one must main-
tain a C average throughout his
school career, ﬁle application with
the dean of women, and must prom-
ise to pay back the money at two
per cent interest within two years
after graduation.

Virginia Wickersham, Col. ’31, is
chairman of the committee. Those
aiding her are: Sara Jones, Col. ’31;
Adelaide Hartman, Col. ’31; Sara
Dunmire, Ed. ’31; Amy Long, Ed.
’32; Dolores Weslager, Ed. ’32; Jane
Wille, Ed. ’32; Marjorie Hacking,

Mada, Honorary Wits Group,
Learn About "Tests, Find
There Ain’t No. I. Q.

Meda, honorary, met on Wed-
nesday of this week to discover
just how intelligent they were.
Professor Whitmer of the psy-
chology department adminis-
tered the test, which was of the
species Intelligentsia Exami-
natia. 0

After the tests were graded,
Professor Whitmer spoke on.
the methods and scales for de-
termining the capabilities of a
subject. The Medians then held
Open forum, i.e., they asked
questions and Prof. Whitmer an-
swered them. In the course of
discussion it came out that there
ain't no I.Q.—--for persons above
the age of 18, and if there is, it
doesn’t mean anything. (We al-
ways knew it didnft--—ever since
that last test.)

M.eda’s next meeting will be
held in Hay, when plans for the
coming year will be made.

Coed Singers
Give Concert

Mrs. Ayars To Lead Recital
On May 6 At Music Hall

 

 

 

The Women’s Glee Club will pre-
sent its Home concert next Wednes-
day evening at 8:15 o’clock in Car-
negie Music Hall, Mrs. Robert
Ayars, conducting.

The Home concert will be the
most important of a series of con-
certs which the Glee club has given
during the past year. Besides‘sing-
ing on the Women’s Day program
and in the Yuletide Festival, it has
also appeared in a concert at the
Pennsylvania Institute for the Blind
on Bayard street, and at the S01-
diers’ Memorial Hospital in Aspin-
wall. Last night the club sang in
Carnegie, and on May 13, it is to

Mrs. Ayars is rounding out her
ﬁrst year as director of the Pitt
Glee Club. Formerly, she conducted
the glee clubs at Harlem College, in
Mexico, Missouri, and at Palmer
College in Albany, Missouri.

Ayzirs Comments

“I find,” says Mrs. Ayars, “that
the women at Pitt are splendid in
co-operation. When one considers
that in an urban university, one’s
time is taken up with innumerable
things, it is remarkable how much
time the girls are willing to give
to rehearsals.”

Exchange of the tickets in the ac-
tivity book for reserved seats begins
today and will continue until May
6 at a stand in Alumni Hall. Any
number of seats may be requested.

The singers will appear in Greek

By Senior.Wome-ni
For Honor

 

 

When the trumpets sound, the

’*inarsIi'a1s and canopy bearers,” the

numerous attendants wait in awed

and thrilling suspense for Anne Ros-
ensweig as Alma Mater to place-the
heavy jeweled crown on the dark,
wavy hair of Margaret Hall, a sixth
Senior Queen will be added to the
royal lineage by the women’s class
of "1931.

For Margaret Hall, president of
W. S. G.‘A. has been elected to
represent her class in the traditional
senior week ceremony which will be
held the day before commencement.
Selected for persona1ity—and men
and women alike agree that’ she bub-
bles over with energy and tact,
friendliness and poise; for scholar-
ship—she was eligible and was
tapped to Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity last May; for
Activities——she has so ‘many that
they can’t be enumerated--national
president of Cwens, honorary sopho-
more activities fraternity, (second
term); active work in W. S. G.
as Decorations Chairman her sopho-
more year, secretary next, and now
president. She is also a member of
Mortar Board, national honorary ac-
tivities fraternity. _

But most of all Peg is represen-
tative of the ﬁnest all round stu-
dent in Pitt——scholastically, socially,
and in friendships and acquaintances
she is undoubtedly as outstanding in
popularity as she is in activities.
And this includes faculty and admin-
istration members as well as stu-
dents.

An ideal is hard to find in reality,
but Margaret Hall comes appropri-
ately to prove that it wasn’t so dif-
ficult for the coeds of 1931.

rather a cut and ﬁll which has cre-
ated a fairly level plain about 400

by 200 feet. Toward Fifth avenue,
. DeSoto and Lothrop streets, the “ex-
lcavation" shelves off in high banks,
but on the Terrace street side the
!hill has been hacked away by steam-
,shovel, dynamite and crowbar crew
;until a hi h cliff has been formed.
;Since the ill is alternating layers
;of shale and rock, mostly the latter,
=the cliﬂ’ face is ﬁrst “shot” with
dynamite.

All the rock thus loosened is then
pried off the face of the cliff by
‘human ants clinging to the side of
lthe wall. Theirs is hazardous occu-
pation. When they are not busy
drillin gholes for the dynamite and
tamping the dangerous stuff into
them, they are standing upon a two-
ton rock which they are wiggling
slowly off its perch on the cliff. .
The masses of shale and rock
thus crumbled down to the floor of
the excavation is then scooped up

trucks for transportation away from
there.

By this slow and laborious proc-
ess, over 60,000 cubic yards of
earth and rock have been removed
from the hill. At present the sec-
ond wing of the hospital toward
Lothrop street is being excavated,
or perhaps, more properly, “blasti-
cated."

The medical center, it has been
estimated, is a $15,000,000 project,
of which the Presbyterian Hospital
with which is combined the Eye and
Ear Hos ital, is the largest unit.
The Chil ren’s Hospital on ,DeSoto
street and the Falk Clinic on Fifth
avenue are’ two completed units.
Others are lanned, among them the
$500,000 E wards. Laboratories for
the University's medical school.
Completion of the entire project will
give the Pittsburgh district and the
University possession of as ﬁne a
medical plant as there is anywhere
in the world. .

“Yes," says Grace D. Ely, art and
fashion consultant of the University
Bureau of Research, “at least for
several seasons. The ankle length
gown for extremely formal after-
noon and evening wear will remain
. _. because it is graceful and femi-
nine. ’

And that comes from one who
knows. Miss Ely has just returned
from Palm Beach, fashionable and
glittering resort, where she made an
extensive study of the predominat-
ing styles for men and women. We
naturally hied to her office in hope
that she would divulge the very
newest notes of fashion for milady.
That, Grace was most gracious
enough to do.

How much of the student's budget
should be appropriated to insure an
adequate wardrobe, we queried.

She Smiles

Miss Ely's lips curled and a smile
blossomed on her gay, round face.
No, she wasn't quite able to answer
that, but she had this to offer: “The
size of a woman's wardrobe is no
guarantee that she is well dressed.
t is, rather, smart to be thrifty.
Some girls who have two pairs of
shoes are better dressed than girls
with ten pairs.” Miss Ely stressed
utter simplicity and versatility in
the apparel of a girl whose ward-
robe is necessarily limited. She
should for example, she explained,
purchase a dress which has a re-
movable jacket and thus can be
transformed into a formal or infor-
mal gown as the occasion requires.

When asked to comment upon the
mode of dress as reflected on the
Pitt campus, Miss Ely asserted that
“the keynote of mode is suitability

the daily routine. Up in the coun-
try school the girls wear typical
country outﬁts. . .but here where
you come to school in an automobile
or a street car, you would be al-
lowed a more sophisticated outﬁt. It
should, however, be practical. En-
vironment governs the degree of
formality or informality of the cos-

tuine.”
Petticoats Black
Among the “juicy morsels” of
fashion which may appear in the
forthcoming season, says Miss Ely,
is the return of the petticoat, “the
good old rustling petticoat with ruf-
ﬂes. The petticoat, in such instances
will deﬁnitely constitute a part of
the costume.”
will be strongly felt in both jewelry
and the costume; strong ﬂashing and
daring color contrasts in the dress
will be a predominating note. Miss
Ely predicts the return of the veil
and jewelled clips in the hair. Hats
will soon reach the proportions of
skull caps and will be worn farther
back upon the head; thus the veil
will become indispensable in keeping
the hair in place. Of the extremes
in fashion, Miss Ely mentions a new
7-8 sleeve length and a bifurcated
evening gown.
Then to the very vital dictum
which is of so great concern to ev-
ery well groomed young lady, “what
are the skirt lengths?’
Couturiers decree the upper calf
length for sport wear, middle calf
for street wear, lower calf for the
afternoon and ankle length to the
floor for evening.
Miss Ely notices the tendency to-
ward the elegant, the feminine, the
statuescﬁue and the gracious styles
in the p ace of the jaunty and ﬂap-
perish mode.

Famous Woman Research

By HELEN IIEICK

Dr. Florence R. Sabin, a noted
American- woman, visited the Uni-
versity last week when‘ she was
here to deliver the Mellon lecture on
April 23, before the Biological. Soci-
ety of the Pitt School of Medicine.

Dr. Sabin is one of the outstand-
ing members of the Rockefeller In-
stitute for Medical Research. Her
line of research lately has been de-
voted almost entirely to- work on

plain it as ii venture in co-opera»
tive research.”

ew York, Dr._ Sabin
shares a.7large apartment with oth.
er. doctors of the institute. There
are only seven women besides Dr.

does to the disease. She said that
the disease is a Vici°118' 9113019: 3,3
far as, she can, see. Bacllhp 01‘d1'
'r.arily, when dead are harmless. but.
in tuberculosis dead bacilli are
harmful. ' _ _
In 1925, Dr. Sabin began this
work with the Rockefeller Insti-
tute. She organized a new attack

contracted Mulford Drut Company.
9, commercial firm, to‘ grow tubercle-
bacilli for the chemistry end of the
work. Dr. C. W. White of the in-
stitute was appointed to push the
chemistry of t e roblem. Much
material was ii ed. Mulford’s
bought enough chemicals and glass-
wear to last ten or ﬁfteen years.
They shipped to Dr. White twenty
pounds of bacilli at ‘a time, enor-
mous amounts to be analyzed.

Use Bacilli

The bacilli was ﬁltered off and
sent to Yale to be analyzed. The
media or liquid from it was sent to
Chicago University. After Yale and
Chi 0 had made analyses, they
sent eir ﬁndings and reports bac
to‘ Dr. Sabin. She tries to see how
much of the disease can be repro-
duced by these chemical fractions
which have been analyzed out by
Yale and Chicago Universities.

Chicago does the chemical as-
pects. Yale works on the eﬁects of
the protein. Rockefeller Institute
is working more on the fats, and is
doing all the biological testing.

Dr. Sabin’s name recently ap-
peared on a list of ten most distin-
guished Americanwomen, and in
1929, she was the recipientof the
Pictorial Review prize for the most
noteworthy achievement by a wom-
an for that year. She was formerly
a member of the faculty of Johns
Hopkins University for twenty-ﬁve
years. She is the author of more
than ﬁfty original papers which
have appeared in scientiﬁc jour-
nals during the past thirty years.

On Ideas Contributed
At 4-Day Meet

Approximately one hundred and
thirty-five delegates from colleges
and universities all over the United
States were represented at the con-
vention of the National Student Gov-

ernment Association at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, last
week, lasting from Wednesday un-
til Saturday.

Margaret Hal-l, Col. '31 and Edith
Raschen, Col. ’32, W. S. . A. presi-
dents for this year and next, re-
spectively, represented Pitt at the
convention. With regards to the aid
she received from the convention
which will help her next year, Edith
Raschen commented, “I must say I
learned that Pitt has a good Wom-
en's Self-Government Association. I
received a lot of i-ew ideas from
the girls I became acquainted with,
but the opinion is that Pitt usually
contributes more than it receives.”

Registration

The greater part of the opening
day, Wednesday, was spent in regis-
tration and sight-seeing over the
University of Michigan campus. In
the_ evening a reception was held,
which gave the girls a chance to get
together. .

One of the most interesting fea-
tures of the convention was the talk
given by Miss Nellie Lee Holt of
Stevens College, Columbia, Missouri,
at the opening session, Thursday
morning. Miss Holt spoke on the
place of women in the modern col-
lege and everyda" world. She dis-
cussed the responsibility placed on
women, expressing the belief that
on campus as in other places, wom-
en hold the balance of responsibility
and that no civilization has ever ad-
vanced higher than its women im-
pellc_d it. The speaker used this
citation in regards to temperance
among college men and women and
cited that whether or not drinking
is indulged in depends to the great-
est extent upon the women.

She also commented upon the rush
of college life, telling her listeners
that they should indulge in siestas
during the day, as do the Spanish.

Point System

The advisability of a strenuous
point system was one of the subjects
of discussion in the groups which
were formed according to urban or
non-urban locations, after Miss
Ho_lt_s address. The consensus of
opinion in regards to this question
was that a system with a smaller
number of points required, but with
more strict enforcement of those
P01Ylf€S W0111d give a greater number
of girls the chance ‘- participate in
activities. Plans for orienting non-

Margaret Hall, Col. '31, retirii
president of Pitt’s W. S. G. A., led
one of the afternoon’s groups _ion
the subject of the relation of the
Self-governing associations with the
women’s athletic associations. The
decision which was reached was that
although the two bodies differ in
their activities to a great extent, the
athletic body should be amply repre-
sented in the campus government.

General Business

At the general business meeting
held Saturday morning, committees
on constitutions, recommendations
and resolutions were drawn up. The
suggestions submitted by the recom-
mendations committee, of which both
Miss Hall and Miss Raschen were
members, included the ideas that
delegates be divided into dormitory
and non-dormitory groups, that con-
vention subjects be sent out previ-
ous to the convention, group leaders
chosen, that a roster should be
posted as soon as the girls are reg-
istered, and that permanent ad-
dresses of the officers of the differ-
ent associations be sent to the reg-
istrar of the national association.

Among the social events included
in the convention program were a
formal dance Friday evening, and a
banquet at the end of the session,
Saturday evening. ,

Cornell University, Ithaca, New
York, was chosen as host to the next
convention, in 1933, and the Univer-
sity of South Dakota will hold the
sectional convention next year.

87 REBECCA WEEBER

May brings days when you just
can't help getting hungry and then
the best thing to do is to drop in
the Betsey Ross Tearoom on the
corner of Forbes and Oakland,
glance at their menu and order the
best things imaginable to eat.
There you can ﬁnd anything you
wish, from soup to pie-—and they
are delicious.

For your Spring Formal the Tech-
bound Studio on Bouquet street has
designed the best-looking dance pro-
grams in leather. They have them
in all colors and will print anything
you want on the cover‘ in go (1 let-
ters. Why not be original; drop in
and see Mr. David and let him sug-
gest something new for that always-
to-be-rememberedakdanee.

Let joy be unconfined! With only
about a month more of_ this jolly
racket of trying to acquire an edu-
cation, get a OOD fountain pen
from the Singer Pen Shop in the
Jenkins Arcade, take those ﬁnal
tests with no fear in your eyes and
then away for a glorious yacation
and a change from scholastic cares.

“Y” Names Nine To

Presidents’ Council '

Breaking the deadlock whidh held
the Y. M. C. A. puzzled for the past
two weeks, the “Y” electoral col-

lege ﬁnally chose nine men to lead_

the Pitt association next year as the
President's Council. The men elect-

ed are Franklin Yellig, Mines '32:‘

James McAfee, Mines '32; John D.
Paulus, Col. '34; S. B. Wuerten-
berger, Col. '32; Arthur Charles-
worth, Col. '33; John Holbrook, Eng.
'34; T. W. Forrester, Col. '32‘
Alonzo D. Brewer, Col. ’33, and
Wayne Patterson, Ed. '32.

The electoral college which elect-
ed these men was composed ‘of the
committee of management, the
members of the cabinet, representa-
tives of the association units and
representatives of the dental and
medical schools. ‘
tion in the election methods used by
thhe Y. M. C. A.

The reason for such a; drastic

ge was given as the inability of
a single president to take’ care of
the enlarged activities of the Y. M.
C. A. Each of the above men will
have the duties of a president and
will preside over a cabinet and sev-
eral committees. '"

on yourself? Feel yourself relaxing . . . forgetting that you

stores your ego, refreshes your spirit, makes you aware of
your own inﬁnite possibilities. No fiction about unreal
heroines can give you quite the same lift. Vogue is yours

. . . all yours.

For Moulding Pitt Band
lnto Pine Musical Unit

We have all known the glamour‘

the concert band its Home concert
in Carnegie Music Hall to show just

concert instruments. Under the
capable direction of Coach Rocereto,
these" student blowers were moulded
into aniusical unit which might
conceivably give even a symphony
orchestra a run‘ for its money.

. Light Opera '

The predominance of ‘light opera
music showed Rocereto’s, good taste
in selection of numbers for his pro-
gram. Victor Herbert was repre-
sented b the well-known entr’acte

selections. from- “The Serenade”;
DeKoven by ai-rs from “Robin. Hood”
and even the beloved, Gilbert ‘and
Sullivan were. not forgotten.‘

. Those" of us» who wondered how
the ‘delicate Meiiuette Celebre of
Paderewski would--fare when played’
in brass received. a? pleasant sur--
prise to know that it fared not only
well, wbutthat: it lost not a tittle of.

 

in those parts which even a compe-
tent pianist cannot play loudly
enough.

The Thais Intermezzo, a violin
solo by Morris Cohen, seemed a bit
incoherent but that may be because
the composition itself is not force-
ful enough to suit this reviewer’s
taste. Mr. Cohen’s technique and
interpretation, however, show him
to be an artist on his instrument.
He is not yet a master but he has
the stuffing which will eventually
produce a genuinemusician.

The comet solo, “Surf Polka,”
played by Arnold Battaglini, was
dear to the heart of anyone who en-
joys goodbrass music. It seems to
me that’ the full richness of a cor-
net cannot be equalled and Mr. Bat-
taglini blew that comet for all its
musical worth. _ 3

One might hope. in: the future that
the Pitt band will draw away,1’ro‘m‘_

After about four weeks of actual

was brought to a close Wedliesdiiy
coach. ' .

Sutherland is thoroughly content
with the results of the practice. He
said: ~ ‘ I

‘‘I am greatly pleased with the
spring practice. The players showed
a marked improvement in form, abil-
ity, and condition. 'l.‘,he;~-spirit "of
those participating was excellent
throughout, and this aided the
coaches a great deal; ,The'ses‘sions
never seemed too long nor,~~for that

us just enough time to, put the play-
ers through the necessary work.”
When asked; what he thought of
“Pitt’s chances next, season, Suther-
land answered: _ _ ‘ V
“I feel highly conﬁdent abou

too distant future the entire,’ hill

practice ﬁeldwlll be leveled out and
turned into a. giant practice lot. If
thisis ever done, Sutherland expects
to call out as many students. as pos-

sible, divide them into groups ac- 7

As Summer Approaches 

About this time of the year there
are certain signs, that make them-
selves manifest, that fofetell the ad-

vent of the summer vacation. In
the sport ﬁeld the signs are most
convincing.

When May pulls around in all its
“verdant glory,” (good old Words-
worth) Head Football Coach Doctor
Sutherland calls off spring training.
He tells us that he is well satisﬁed
with next year’s prospects. He be-
wails the fa that there were not
more men ou , and while not giving
a gloomy prediction for the next sea-
son, refuses to admit that the foot-
ball team might have a good record.
That is sign number one.

Carlson Duo

Basketball Coach Carlson calls out
the basketeers for their spring
training drills. He innovates a new
offense. Gets his phsychology book
out and thinks up a new fad. Gives
the players dizzy spells with the
problem where he should be when
play number 771/.» is being played,
and wants to have the center jump
eliminated in favor of the inverted
hoop. That is sign number two,
Also this time of year gives Ut-
terback a chance to get some of the
track publicity he deserves. You
read in the papers, that Utterback
won this; Utterback, the backbone
of the Pitt team, almost won the
meet singlehanded; Utterback set a
new record for the broa.d jump, the

three other men with him. But still:
it is a good sign of sign number‘
four.

Another sign that is very appar-
ent to the observer is the scarcity of
football men, and all the other ath-
letes, in the Activities Hut. Usually
the athletes congregate in the Hut
before going to practice. They ain't
there no more. Sign number ﬁve
has been translated.

Festival Athletes

The last and most signiﬁcant sign
of the waning year is the Spring
Festival. How come athletic, you
ask ? Allow me to proceed with my
dissertation. If you saw how the
committeemen perspire in their ef-
fort to get somewhere, you wouldn’t
ask. One man I know of had to be
in three places at the same time.
He was not there. But the efforts
he made to be there are amazing.
He tried to talk on a telephone, lis-l
ten to a committee meeting, and get
on his way to the third a pointment.
If that isn’t athletic, well ping-pong
is a major sport. Ah, gentle reader,
sign number six has just passed be-
fore your most honorable eyes.

Clinic Work

Over In June

Installing Fixtures For All
Treating Departments

ule, the end of the school year should
ﬁnd the Falk Memorial Clinic com-
pleted and ready for occupancy by
the incoming medical staff.

A. A. Lyness, superintendent of
construction for the contracting com-
pahy who is doing the work on the

clinic, expects that his work will be
ﬁnished by the ﬁrst of June. There
is yet no indication of when the
Clinic will be taken over and opened
to serve the public.

Interior work on the clinic that re-
mains to be ﬁnished includes only
washing and polishin of terrazzo
flooring on the groun ﬂoor, the in-
stallation of — li g h tin g ﬁxtures
throughout the building, and the
work of connecting up medical and
dental ﬁxtures. Kitchen equipment
is being shipped this week and will
be installed as soon as it arrives.

Grading of the lawn in front of
the Clinic is being completed at pres-
ent, and the walks will be in place
by the middle of next week. The
contemplated widening of Fifth ave-
nue, which will probably be under-
taken by the city sometime within
the next year, has been provided for
in the grading of the Clinic prop-
erty. A clearance of twenty feet will
remain after the street has been
widened, leaving ample room before
the building.

Foundation and structural steel
work on the Presbyterian and Eye
and Ear Hospitals will be carried on
by the present contractors, who have
completed the excavations for these
sites. It is not known when this
work will begin, as the contractors
are waiting for word from the com-
mittee in charge of the building pro-
gram before they proceed with any
construction.

Forest Park Meeting Plans To
Be Discussed By “Y’s”

A Forest Park pre-conference ban-
quet will be held at the Church of
the Ascension, corner of Neville
street and Ellsworth avenue, Tues-
day, May 5, at 5:45 o’clock.

This dinner is held for‘ the pur-
pose of recruiting men and women
students interested in attending the

to be held at ,Forest Park, Pa., June
10 to 20. .

A feature of the evening’s pro-
gram will be moving pictures of last
year’s conference taken by Dr. Kin-
ley McMillan. This will be the ﬁrst
opportunity University students will
have to view these pictures, al-
though they have been shown at
various colleges throughout the
state to create an interest i.n this
summer’s conference.

Students Speak V

Miss Helen Battrick, secretary of

the Y. W. C. A., will outline for the

All of which leads us to believe
that the language scholar will have
to Watch the “ups and downs” of

is more consequential, with the de-
velopment of the oscilloscope, learn-
ing French in “ten easy lessons”
may become a reality instead of an-
other Saturday Evening Post adver-
tisement. Henceforth the French

That the instrument may prove
of practical value in other than
academic ﬁelds was asserted by W.
O. Osvon, research engineer of the
Westinghouse Company, when he
expressed the belief that the oscillo-
scope may be efficacious in the re-
moval of some of the raucous city
noises. His scientiﬁc explanation
follows:

“It is entirely possible to dovetail
the high and low spots of many
noises to produce or approach si-
lence. For instance two tuning
,forks with equal wave lengths or
ifrequencies are set in motion. While
;each produces a note which is heard
iby the human ear, yet both together
under certain conditions produce a
silent note which is inaudible.” Thus
by controlling the extremes of ob-
jectionable noises it is highly possi-
ble to tffect changes which are not
irritating to the ear.

The invention may lead to the re-
moval of such aggravating noises as
the piercing train whistle, the grum-
bling street car and the rat-tatting
rivet. Perhaps scientists will be

musical in the city racket and thus
obliterate much of that grating
cacophony which gnaws at'the hu-
man ncrvousaystcm. ..

_Ping-pong, though a new sport at
Pitt, already has become popular.
Twenty girls are participating in a

League’s Start

Advance Fin al Date
For Completion Of
First Round

Singularly like the Pittsburgh Pi-
rates, the Interfraternity Mushball
League, sponsored by the Sports
Staff of the Weekly, got off to a bad
start because of inclement weather
conditions. Not one of the ﬁrst
I‘0l€nd' games have been played as
ye .

Under such circumstances, the ﬁ-

the games will be moved up from
Wednesday, May 6, to Friday, May
8‘; However, all games must be
played and the reports of them in
the hands of either Morris Cohen or
Robert Remaley by midnight on
Friday.

Since the ﬁrst round has not been
started, the staff has agreed to per-
mit Theta Delta Psi and Sigma Chi
to enter_the tournament. They will
play their ﬁrst round together.

As has been announced, the tour-
nament will be conducted by elimi-
nation. _When a team has once been
beaten, it is deﬁnitely out of the
running. In case-of disagreement,
all matters should be referred to
the committee as announced last
week. '

Other regulations which must be
followed’ are:

1. Underhand pitching, no twist.

2. Forty-ﬁve feet between bases,
and thirty feet between the pitch-
er’s box and the plate.

3. No ﬂy ball can be caught in
the chest. If so, batter gets to
ﬁrst and each man advances a

ase.

Boxers, Cheerleader,
Panther Get Insignia

At‘_its last meeting, the athletic
council reversed its- previous decision
against‘ the awarding of letters and
numerals to the members of the
varsity and freshman boxing teams
and decided to honor these men in
the same manner as they had the
members of _the other sport teams.

Members of the varsity team who
received letters were: John Luch,
heavyweight; Joseph Tommins,
light-heavyweight; Heinie Zimmer-
man, middleweight; Henry Martin,
welterweight; Marius Santicola,
lightweight, and Milton Bradley,
featherweight.

Freshmen who were awarded nu-
merals included Joe Milutis and
George Patterson, both 115 pound-
ers, and Jack Schrisker, middle-
weight, who is regarded as being
the best collegiate prospect in the
district. ~

Letters were also awarded to the
Panther and to John Williams, head
cheerleader, during the past year.

Dr. Boots Addresses
Women Voters’ Group

Dr. Ralph S. Boots, professor of
political science, and an authority
on municipal administration, ad-
dressed the General Council of the
National League of Women Voters
in Washington, D. C., last week.

He spoke on the subject, “Can the
Direct Primary Be Improved?” This
was of much interest to the women,
since the direct primary has been
called the adopted child of the
League ‘of Women Voters.

There were only two formal proc-
esses of nomination preceding the
direct'_ primary inthe development
of political institutions in the United
States—,—-the legislative or congres-
sional caucus and the delegate con-'
vention. Dr. Boots, , in his talk,
showed the evolution and the possi-
bilities of improving the direct
primary.

According to Smith, the department is one of the most eﬁicient in

the United States and it takes both
brain and brawn to make headway
in the department, civil service ex-
aminations and heroism being the
requisite for promotion. The City
of Pittsburgh also conducts a school
for its ﬁre “demons.” Each re-
cruit is forced to go through rigid
training and many breath-taking ex-
periences. This school is open to
inspection.

Above all, Chief Smith stressed
the fact that his ﬁre salvagers were
saving millions of dollars for both
the public and especially the fire
underwriters. This division of the

ﬁre department is the ﬁrst to enter
the burning structure, it being their

ture, clothing, etc., from being
ruined. When the squad enters a
building they cover all the loose

The talk was given at a very op-
