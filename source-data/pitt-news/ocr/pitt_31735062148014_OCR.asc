i‘»"RIDAY, SEPTEMBER ‘32, 1339

‘IDon’t Yell--Go See Someone’
May Cure ‘Growing Pains’

\Ve were glad to hear Provost Fitzgerald put his new policy into
the words “Don ’t yell——go see someone” when he spoke at the fresh-
man banquet. \Ve respect the provost for what he has done in the
short time he has been here, and trust that he will help to see that not
only can students talk to someone but that soinething; is done about
what they have to say.

Many of the U1iiversity’s administration will, no doubt, be shock-

ed that we call this a new policy. They will say that they were always -

yilling to listen to a student’s problems. But in all too many in-
stances students came away feeling that that was precisely the
trouble. The person in authority listened. but did nothing; at least,
not openly. If the student. pressed the point, he, too often, was made
to feel that. he was a pest, or that he was being given a run-around.

‘We know that much of this feeling can be attributed to what the
trustees’ committee referred to as “growi1ig pains.” More speciﬁc-
ally, it probably falls into the troubles resulting from the poor admin-
istrational 0I'gj8.lllZélll()l].

Noiv, however, these troubles are to be remedied. Much of the
undercurrent of complaints or “gripes” around our school should be
aired and repaired as soon as possible. “*9 feel. certain that if the
satisfaction. can be obtained nowhere else. the provost himself will
be glad to handle the matter. If a student doesn’t know whom to
seeilct him ask a member of the faculty or a(liu'mist.ratio11. They’ll
be able to tell him.

It's time we put an end to our “growing pains” and act like the
{neat university that we are.

There Must Be lslarnnony
011 Capitol Hill

Not since 1917 has the United States C-ongress had such an im-
portant decision before them as that which. they will be required to
make at the special racssion which convened yesterday.

The country as a whole is looking; to these legislators to decide
on a policy of neutrality which will do as much as possil)le to keep us
out of the rapidly spreading‘ European conﬂict.

It isn’t goiiig to be easily arrived at, this decision, but tlm1'c is
one thing of which we are certaiii. lf our representatives and senators
have assembled at this session as members of the Democratic or of the
Republican parties, they may fall into a mesh of political quibbling;
whicli can only result in ineffective compromises and a job half done.

Even more than this. such useless a.rg'1iing may also result in
heated disputes as to which country is on the side of rig_rlit, or why, in
the selling of munitions and food supplies, we should be partial. to
certain countries and ignore others. A

Let.‘ our Congress take their cue from the Labor, Liberal, and
Conservative parties of England. Althougli the breaches between
them in not-so-important domestic and foreign problems have always
been wide, they stood above petty prejudices and party politics when
their country really needed their united action.

Clear thinking‘ is needed at this congressional meeting, plus level-
headed at't.ent.ion to the problem that calls for immediate solution.

Above all else, the men and women we have sent to \Vashington
should be Americans ﬁrst. not Republicans or Democrats, or English
and French or German and Russian s_vmpat'hizers.

All   Note on Some Peculiar
Habits of Our“ Childhood

If you have fully recovered from the shock of registering, perhaps
you noticed that during_r our summer‘ absence the Cathedral’s second
ﬂoor walls have been cleaned, and the foot—marks removed.

All of us, we think. would like to keep the walls of the Cathedral
looking the same shade as the ceiling, but that is not possible if tliey
are used as places to prop our feet. while we are talkiiig in the halls.
After all, the Cathedral is rather a nice place, and we assume Univer-
sity students are mature enough to have put away such childish habits
as initial-carving and wall-marking’.

Then, too, we do in a sense, own the building‘. and should have a
certain amount of pride in its use—a pride which would cause us to

take care of what we have so that the Cathedral may be handed -down . ‘

to future classes still retaining its original beauty and usefulness.
This is our Cathedral of Learning. ,

§‘Darling’ Takes A Mail!

Your informer spent three-quarters of the summer absorbing a regu-
lar. shellacking on the tennis courts from Bill Daufenbach, Ted Biddle,
Bob Corley and Dr. Paul Zehfuss . . Big Bill is the “iron man” . .
Biddle serves the aces . . Corley is the steadiest . . Dr. Zehfuss is the
placement artist . . I have the best racquet! Other faculty men
on the courts were Dr. Ben Vvilliams and Dr. Verne Vllright The
poly sci professor showed his young‘ son how to garner points.

Tragic note of the hot months was struck when it was learned that Miss
Alice Beatty, darling to all act.ivit;ies men who at some time or another find
itheir way into the dean of men’s carpted suite, up and took unto herself a
l man . . . She now answers to Mrs. Dorfield.

Long Lme Of ‘Oomph’ Gals

Pittites in the city this summer were few and far between . . But
glimpsed on a motor bicycle in Oakland, politely shagging at Bill Green’s,
holding bidless bridge hands at the Phi Kap abode was Mary McCahill

Shoe-admiring‘ (I don’t know if he bought) at a. downtown store,
tall, rugged, red Pat Cusick . . Toting alleged text books in the Cathe-
dral, Fritizie Bentzel and the victim of his affections, Nancy Hiles
Ditto portly, jovial Sudser Jim Kerr.

One of the brightest of the long line of “oomph” gals at the Kappa castle,
Gene Pyle, with her 0. a. 0., Clint. Sipe . . Decorating the Fifth avenue
lawn from time to time were such members of the prominent Tuck Shop

coterie as Betty Jane Martin Cinderman Hap Stickel, who is still a
stickler for the Weber g;al——Dot.

For  ll   t

By Don Hainilton

‘Xitli the school year that has
just begun, comes the second an-
niversary of the 'u1tra2nural sports
pi'og1*ani under iiitrainural direc-

tor James Potts.

After a successful initiation last
year intramurals will offer even a
wider range of activity to all men

athletes
The pro-
gram gives every man on campus a
in several

students, excepting those
with a varsity standing.

chance to participate
sports of his particular liking.

The entire program is an optional
affair affording physical activity to
all interested whenever their time

per its. A While participation is en-

tirely voluntary, activity in the pro-

gram would -afford chances for exer-

cise, perhaps improve the partici-
pant’s game, and provide him with a.

wider activities scope.
Calendar Set Up

A calendar for the year has been

drawn up to include the three sea-
sons: fall, winter, and spring. Im-
mediate action will begin with the

fall schedule which includes eight
sports, two of which, touch football

and soccer, will be run off in leagues.

Speedball, handball, swimming,
and cross-country are all-campus
tournaments open to individuals

rather than teams. Horseshoes and
tennis will be open to doubles teams;
that is, any two men in the Univer-
sity may team up to compete for the
laurels.

The Intramural set-up includes
three divisions of teams under the
fraternity, engineering, and inde-
pendent headings. The teams in each
division battle it out for division
championships with the ultimate
winners clashing for intramural
supremacy.

The sports under the all-campus
heading, the champions will each re-
ceive a trophy for the particular
sport in which they participated.
Like awards will be made to league
winners and all-intramural champ-
ions. The grand prize, which was
awarded at the Druid smoker last
Wednesday to Phi Gamma Delta,
1938-39 titleholders, is the All-Point
Trophy, based on the sum total of a
year’s competition in the Intramural
Program.

Points are awarded for entering a
team and playing through the sched-
ule, for division championship and
runner-up, for each game played in
the elimination series when neces-
sary, and for team championship. If,
at the end of the year, there is a tie
for the number of points, the team
