Labor Educator
To Give Speech .

Before Inquiry

Miss Stein to Explain
Efforts of Federation
In Labor Teaching

Speaking from herexperience in
labor education, Miss Rose Stein, sec-
retary of the Federated Labor Schools
will address Inquiry Forum on “Edu-
cation for Labor?” in 129 Cathedral
at 1 o’clock today.

The Federatidn of Labor Schools is
non-‘partisan, Miss Stein explains. It
sends out teachers and speakers to
address their ai‘ﬁ1iate’s—both the
American Federation of Labor and
the Congress of Industrial Organiza-
tion.

Outstanding leaders in the ﬁelds of
sociology and labor teach classes in
social psychology, labor law, history
of imperialism and dramatics.

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics, is a member of the Labor
School’s Advisory Board. Jacob J.
Blair, instructor in economics is
teaching a course" in industrial rela-
tions at the school.

‘‘All the patter in the world about
union responsibility is meaningless,
unless and until the millions of new
unionists are given a systematic
coaching in the handling of at least
the elementary tools which make for
intelligent trade unionism,” Miss
Stein says. ’

“yvorkers must be equipped to re-«
sist the onslaught of totalitarianism

with its propaganda which exhausts,
enervates, and destroys. Our purpose
in the Labor Schools is to help the
workers ﬁnd the whole view of labor
and of the social scheme.”

Miss Stein, a graduate of the Uni-
versity, has written two books, “M-
Day” and “Bonds Without Safety.”
I‘-Ier writings have also been pub-
lished in the Nation, New; Republic,

and the London Economic Journal. ‘

The next issue of the Harvard Busi-
ness Review will include Miss Stein’s
article on “Worker’s Education.”

Glaancciat 1914 Weekly Reveals
Apathy of Students Toward War

United States stand in almost the
same position as we did at theonset
of the first World War. In an at-
tempt to parallel conditions then and
now and to bring more forcibly to
mind the events and changes in at-
titude that drew us into the war,
The Pitt News offers this as the ﬁrst
in a series of articles showing the
effect of that war on University stu-
dents, as reflected in The Pitt Week-
ly, the Pitt News of 1914,

 

By Dorothy Cleland

The curtain went up on the First
World War in 1914, but, if one is to
believe the records left for us in The
Pitt Weekly at that time, students
hardly realized or seemed to care that
there was‘? a war.

Ironically perhaps, students were
more interested in how the football
team, under the famous Pop Warner,
was doing than in what the front
page news from Europe was. Even
Chancellor McCormick in opening the
128th session of the University ap-
parently did not think the war worth
mentioning.

Not until October 9 did the paper
mention it. On that day it carried the
account of an address by Dr. R. F.
Bacon, then director of Mellon Indus-
trial Research. He discussed the ef-
fect of the European war on the
chemical, :_industry in the United
States. At this time no one ques-
tioned the neutrality of -the United

‘ States. Itwas something thatexistedv

.as atlhaﬁer of fact. ‘

recognition of what was happening in
Europe. Football was still the sub-

ject for discussion not only in head-'

lines clear across the front page but
also on the sports and editorial pages.
Editorials plead for loyalty to the
football team and to the University,
these two being synonymous;
lamented the fact that those stu-
dents, namely the band members,
who were most loyal to the Univer-
sity had to take second rate seats at
the games. Student letters bemoaned
the most regrettable fact that stu-
dents had to suffer the indignities of

standing in line for tickets and seats 1

at the games.

Jordan’s Predictions

In November a journalist address-
ed students, who were particularly
interested, on how‘ war news is gath-
ered. I

In December the ﬁrst real note,of
the war was an address by Dr. David
Starr Jordan on “The Causes of
War.” Declaring that the war was
the result of “armed peace,” Dr. Jor-
dan said that if the people had had
their choice they would not have
gone to the front. He ended his
speech with a few predictions.
“Slum breeding—that is what will
prevail,” he said, and “Nations of Eu-
rope are dying and new nations will
rise that can not be like the old.” 

Perhaps best representative of the
opinion of students on the war at
this time was a dinner which the eve-
ning school held in December. . The

. dinner -was an.Amunition Banquet at
which such delicacies as Su.bm‘arine'¢

puddling. Cossacks. and Floating Tor-

. pedoes were served.

Editors Notice War‘  _ 0
In the last issue of The Pitt Week-
ly before Christmas the editors ﬁnal-
ly condescended to notice the war.
Perhaps it was the same Spirit of
Christmas that bothered Scrooge

which caused this. Whatever it was, .
the editors.-bade. their .readers re‘-
“ member their less fortunate brothers"

across’ the water who were going to
the trenches. L ’

These ﬁrst few months of school at
the University and war in Europe in-
dicate that the students here were
wrapped up in a little world of their
own that ended with the campus

boundaries and the markers on the.

football ﬁeld; -mostly the-‘latter. There
seemed to be a strange disinterest in
and flippancy toward the war on the
part of the majority of the students.

Freshmen Take
Customs Exam;  

Several hundred freshman men
will sweat and groan their way
through the annual custom examina-
tion tomorrow, during their Orien-
tation class periods. The examina-
tion is under the auspices of Men’s
Council.

Not to be out-done by past ﬁrst-
year men, the men of ’43 will pre-
sent the University with innumera-
ble new cheers and the latest ver-
sions of the school songs. Having
done this, they will rewrite the His-
tory of the University, and rearrange
the personnel.

The examination will bea large
factor in the awarding of the gold
panther keys, to be distributed at
the freshmen honor assembly later
in the month.

These keys will ‘be awarded for
marked achievement scholastically, in
orientation, and in activities.

Council._
Describing the weck’s activities

Wuertenberger says, “the rushing
season is on and all Greeks are
searching for Neophytes. A strong

universityhas much tradition, arising
from each of its units. I believe that
the fraternity, steeped in tradition, is
the cornerstone of the University
life. The fraternity is the place to
enjoy life in a creative social atmos-
phere with the fellows you like. A
chapter unit provides human rela-
tionships which manifest the need for
social order.” '0 N

Rush week continues through Sun-
day morning at 2 o’clock and will be
followed by silence week, until Oc-
tober 23 at 5 o’clock in the after-
noon. During silence week no fra-
ternity man is permitted to approach
or speak to any rushee.

When a prospective pledge re-
ceives a notice, Wuertenberger ex-
plains, he will visit the offce of the
dean of men at the time designated
on his slip, and accept or reject the
bids the various houses have .made

Inter—fraternity rules stipulate that
during rush week a fraternity may
offer any sort of entertainment to the
rushee, with the‘ exception of allow-
ing the student to stay overnight in
a fraternity house.

The 13 social fraternities on camp-
us, all national organizations, are:
Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Gamma Delta,
Phi Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi
Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Sigma Chi, and Sigma Alpha Mu.

Kennedy reminds rushees that they
are obligating themselves in no way
by accepting’ invitations to as many
of the affairs as they possibly can.

of blushing, credulity, embarrass-
ment, and outrage that run through
the school.

Breaking with tradition, Jack
Stauff, C42, chairman of the dance-
committee,_ announces that this year’s=
Soph Hop to be held Friday evening,-,
October 27, at the Schenley Hotel,
will be completely informal.

Together with Matt Marshall,
C42, business manager, and Ralph
Kallock, C42, publicity director, and
committees including 31 sophomores,
Stauff is making arrangements for
“the most novel dance ever staged
on or off campus, the Screwball
Hop.” Stauff explains that the real
purpose of the Hop is to replace the
elegance and formality of the seniors
and the sophistication of the junior;-3
with nothing more than a “lot of real-
fun.”

The Screwball Hop will depart:
from precedent in more ways" than
one, Stauff says. For practically the
ﬁrst time in University history ad-
mission to an upperclass dance will
be less than the customary $2. Tick-
ets for this dance, which go on sale
today, are priced at $1.98.

Music Bulletin 0

Theodore M. Finney, associate pro-
fessor of music and director of the
University musical activities, has
been selected editor of the “Bulletin
of the Music Teachers National Asso-
ciation.”

The bulletin, printed locally, is the
ofﬁcial publication of the national as-
sociation, which is composed of men
and women active in the music pro-
fession throughout the country.

Within its membership of over nine
thousand, there are private teachers
of music; a large number of univer-
sity, college, and conservatory teach-
ers and administrators; composers,
conductors, musicologists, editors, and
publishers, Finney reports.

The MNTA has as its goal, the
bulletin states, the “closer linking to-
gether of the music teaching profes-
sion of the entire country. It aims
to foster the growth of state and lo-
cal associations. Its annual conven-

tions and publications offer a na-
tional interchange of new ideas and
progressive methods in music.”

All freshmen and transfer women
are to have their physical examina-
tions completed by the end of this
week, announces Dr. Arlene Mar-

in disclosing the real stuff of which the American Communist is. made.

funds." ,

If it were not for the unfortunate stigma that Congressman Dies bears,
because of his unquenchable thirst for sensationalism and his inability to
,3:-paiuilge fact. from slander, his investigation work would be of tremendous
service to the Ur.-itcd States. I would suggest that Congress disband his
committee and replace it with one conducted in a judicious manner, capable
of ﬁnding the facts.

At the risk of being called a “red baiter,” a “tool of the capitalists,”
and a “stooge" by my Communist friends, I offer a simple antiseptic for
the complete elimination of what little inﬂuence they might have in the
United States: expose them to the light of public investigation and they
will wither as a. dying leaf.

Dedication to What’

At the dedication of the Chinese
nationality room in the evening, Dr.
Hp Shih rhetorically asked his audi-
ence,-which included almost one,-half
of the Chinese population of West-
ern Pennsylvania, what he should
dedicate the room to. He said, in
View of the present world situation,
“I am almost tempted to dedicate
this room to the devout hope that out
of these tribulations and sufferings
there may come the day when brutal
force shall fail and international jus-
tice and order shall prevail.”

Dean Amos Offers Plan
For Fraternity Meeting

Honorary Scholastic Organization May Hear
Phi Beta Kappa Members at Special Meeting

Plans for a meeting of members of all scholastic fraternities to
licar addresses by prominent members of Phi Beta Kappa, honorary
scholastic fraternity, were put forward by Thrysa VV. Amos, dean of
women, at the executive committee meeting of SFA on Thursday.

This assembly would honor the members of the scholastic frater-
nities and bring: them in closer contact with Phi Beta Kappa, which is

not represented by a chapter at¢

the University.

Probably under the sponsorship
of the Scholar’s Day Committee of
SFA, the meeting would be held in
Foster Memorial and would be fol-
lowed by an informal reception. The
Western Pennsylvania Association of
Phi Beta Kappa is an alumni group
headed by the bishop of the Protest-
ant Episcopal diocese of Pittsburgh,
Dr. Alexander Mann.

Similar to Scholar’s Day, the meet-
ing would omit one feature of the
annual spring event: the’ tapping
ceremony. '
SFA Chairmen Summoned

Also discussed at the executive
committee meeting was Dean Amos’
suggestion for a ceremony at Christ-
mas time in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral. It was suggested that
the elevated platforms around the
room be used to present tableaux of
Christmas observance in various parts
of the ‘world.’

Several chairmen of SFA commit-
tees were called in to report on the
activities of their groups. Reports
were heard from William M_cElwain,
C41, of the Pep Assemblies Commit-
tee; Joseph Roberts, C41, of the So-
cial Committee; and William Rial,’
C41, of the Buildings and Grounds
Committee. _

McElwain discussed the proposed
rally to be held before the Duke
game. Inability to obtain any indoor
hall in the district has made it ne-
cessary to hold the rally outside the
Bigelow Boulevard entrance of the
Cathedral. ‘

Football Team to Appear

- The pm Band and football team
will appear on the balcony overlook-i

Hoeveler, C40, will be -SFA represen-
tative at the assembly Friday after-'
noon.

Recommendations were made to
the Buildings and Grounds commit-
tee at the meeting. They were: that

Freshman Dance
Interviews Begin

dral today beginning at 2:30 o'clock.
All applicants are requested to ar-
range for the time of their interview
in the deanof men's ofﬁce and must
bring their dance budgets with them.

Joe Kristufek, C40, chairman of the
appointments committee, requests the
following committee members to
meet with him’ at that time: Peggy
Megee, Ed40; Mary Lewis, C41; Julia
Clemens, C41; Ann Goldszer, C40;
George Hyde, C40; Emil Narick,
BA40; Rae Young, C41; Ray Dimit,
C40; Sam Bonavitta, C40; and faculty
adviser, Theodore Parker, lecturer in

floors of the Cathedral; fountains and
telephone booths be placed in com-
mission; and that a ceremony be
planned for the opening of the new
“Tiffin” shop (Tuck Shop) on the
ground ﬂ.oor.

Evelyn Green, C41, and Robert
Goodwin, E41, were added to the So-
cial Committee when Roberts re-
ported that he needed extra mem-
bers. A proposition was discussed -at
the meeting that a tea dance be held
for students after football games.

The SFA article in the all"-student
issue of “Pitt” will be written by
Rug-gero Ald-isert, C41, it was an-
nounced at the meeting.

The Pitt News

Chinese Room

Continued from Page two

Following is the speech with which
Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of
the Universityaccepted the gift to
the University by the Chinese com-
mittee which symbolized the presen-
tation of the China Memorial room.
Mr. Tsui, I accept this volume
for the University of Pittsburgh, in
the spirit as presented. I accept

it in trust, that it remain at the
University as a symbol of Chinese
culture; as a symbol of the courtesy,
the integrity, the learning, and the

joy of life itself by which the Chi-
nese enrich our American ways.

I feel humble tonight in the
presence of the historic greatness
of the Chinese people. Their philo-
sophers, poets, artists, and states-
men rank ‘with the most elevated
souls who have -appeared on the
earth. Hundreds of millions of
Chinese respond today with clear
understanding to the wealth of
their own heritage. They see the
sunrise, the sunset, the plum blos-
soms, and i" the river among the
hills; they know the de‘p’th"s of
friendships, the value of loyalty
and the value of independent hon-
est thought. __

Still more important, you are a
loveable people. I acceptthis book
as a. symbol, also of affection.

Dr. Bowman then addressed the
Chinese Ambassador, Dr. Hu Shih:

Your E.xcellcncy: May I now ex-
press to you and through you to
your national government our sin-
cere gratitude for your help to-
ward this Chinese ‘class room. We
are much aware that it .'Wi—ll make
for the enrichment. of.  "in-gthis
land. And” to the members ‘iafif ‘tinie-
