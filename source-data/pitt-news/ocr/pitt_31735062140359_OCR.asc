Klein Explains Set-"up

Volume 133, Number 53

F 3 ft ll" Dive  
At a. “Victory” meeting lastliriday, the Defense Stamp committee
resolved to clear up any doubts about the “nature and value” of the
stamps being sold in the battleship drive, inaugurated last Wednesday.
According llo Sales Manager Edwin lﬂein, BA/4-.2, zconnmiﬁzee mem-

bers will exchange and ﬁlled 25-cent stamp booklets laor a defense bond,

worth $25 in 10 years, or redeemable at any Yum: vlior the origllll

Klein also pointed out that al-
though the booklets being distrib-
uted are printed to accommodate
ten-cent stamps, the stamps sold
by the committee may be pasted
in them. i

Oliicial explanation of this ap-
parent inaccuracy L comes from
Leonard Woods, Deputy Stamp ad-

'mini.strator., who said that book-

lets are not available in  "cent de-
nominations.

He also said that it is the value
of the stamp that counls, and not
the number of squares ﬂied in ,a
booklet. He warned, however, that

stamps of different denominations

should not be mixed together in '

one booklet.
“Students who refuse to buy
stamps here. maintaining that they
arealready saving ten-cent stamps,
really have no argumen ” 
chairman Herbert‘ Gall, OMQ3.’ He
explained that provisions have been
made to exchange old booklets for
cash, and then to issue the exchang-
er twenty-ﬁve cent stamps for the
cash. ' i

Because of the inquiries con/‘Herrick: grad-;

cerning the disappearance /of the
"little Iowa," a booth" built in ‘rep-
resent the battleship "Iowa, symbol
of the drive, Klein said that 
booth would be set up only on
each Vlednesday since lint is the
only day stamps will be sold. A
After this Wednesday, the com-
mittee will continue to run the
campaign, but will give the sales
duties to the women’s fraternities,
assisted by Klein. ’ O

Cabinet

By ELAINE KAHN
Britainls recent cabinet }shak»_e-
up, Chm-chill’s answer to the criti-
cism leveled at him as the result
of the defeat of Singapore and the
incident at Brest, met with favor-
able reactions from at least three
members of the University history
department. . .
Typical of their sentiments was
the statement of Dr. James Oliver,

_ head‘ of the history department,
who termed it "a very timely move
and one that indicates a ﬁrmer in-
tention on the part of the Churchill
government to throw politics out
the window and to concentrate
on ability." Dr. Oliver added that
he felt the move was to England’:

pp, SIDNEY KLEIN .
The ..'University’s new $50,000
item-smasher is slowly nearing
ggnompletion, reported Dr. David
Halliday, ‘research fellow in phys-
ics, today, despite lack of materials
the to defense priorities.

“Work on the atom-smasher»
more techincally known as a cyclo-
',}'h'on, is being carried on at a. steady
*‘pace,” he said.

I ' Radiations coming from - the
_ streams of electrically charged par-
 ticles produced by the machine will
III used in treatment of certain dis-
eases, among which are cancer and
lukemia. Radio-active material pro-
‘ducednby the cyclotron will be used
for experiments in bio-chemistry.
 “If an individual with a goiter
>1 is fed radio—active iodine, external
J application of iodine will determine
0 sjrhen the former has reached the
~_ gland. Such knowledge will be valu-
- able in the treatment of goiter,”
»   Halliday explained.

Physicists who make use of the
. gcyclotron, he said, will attempt to
‘J, ﬁnd out more about the mysterious
.. forces. that hold together the pro-

. tons and neutrons within the neu-
cleus of an atom.’ ’

i’iCusicl< Clarifies
.DTD's Position

, §VCharles Cusick, 043, SFA social

chairman, today clariﬁed the posi-
tion of the social committee of SFA
‘in regard to Delta Tau Delta, which

has been placed on social probation
and ﬁned $75.

, Because the fraternity sponsored
' a dance on January 16 which con-
’ llicted with the Junior prom, a
penalty. was inflicted, but it will
» notinvolve complete suspension of
V a social privileges, according to Cus-
’ ii ﬁcks V‘

“Delta Tau Delta. will have to
,,jeunform more rigidly to SFA so-
~_ slal rules. There will be a. few
7minor restrictions,” he said.

V The fraternity was permitted to
 sponsor jointly with Phi Eps1lon_P1
last Saturday night a dance to raise
.hnds ‘for the University Red Cross.

  

   
    
  
   
    
     
 
    
  
   
 
 
 
  
   
  
   
      
  
    
  
   
 
   
     
   
  
    
   
  
   
   
  
 

The atoms of a substance, such
as hydrogen, are bombarded by
streams of electrically charged par-
ticles in an attempt to knock pro-
tons and neutrons out of their nu-
clei. The charge, speed and num-
ber of particles that come out are
measured. Physicists ' hope that
from this data more may be learn-
ed about the structure of the atom’s
nucleus.

The cyclotron will be the twen-
ty-ﬁfth to be built in this country.

collected. ’

The cabinet last year awarded
several slide rules for the best
drawings. _

The contest will be conducted
through drawing class instructors
who will select the best drawings

M of their students for the contest.

Faculty members -of the civil en-

gineering department will  the
‘judges. b

At the same time the cabinet also
appointed more members to the
committee for the al1—university

DR. STEPHEN WILSON
tells of inadequate diet

Pharmacist Lists
American Diet
As Inadequate

The American people do not have
an adequate diet, Dr. Stephen Wil-

son, assistant professor in the
School of Pharmacy, contends in
his new book, “Food and Drug
Regulation.”

“That American diet did not
meet standards of the Committee
on Food and Nutrition of the Na-
tional Research Council was made
—-unmistakably clear at the 1941
conference,” he states.

Dr. Wilson also maintained that
the inability of the people to pro-
tect themselves against misrepre-
sentation and adulteration of com-
modities makes it mandatory that
the government promote the gen-
eral welfare by further pure food
and drug legislation.

In his book, he traces the evolu-
tion of food supply through three
phases: getting sufﬁcient food, pre-
vention of sale of unﬁt food, and
the modern problem of nutrition.

Dr. Wilson has been a member of
the School of Pharmacy faculty
since 1927.
