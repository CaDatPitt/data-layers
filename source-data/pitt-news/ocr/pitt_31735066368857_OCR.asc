— College students ‘across, the
country again may have the threat
of adraft hovering over‘ their heads,
according to predictions of retired

Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub.

Singlaub, who retired from the"

military after several of his critical
statements‘ about President
military policies were
made public, predicted at a press
conference Saturday that a return to
the draft is inevitable.

.“A return to some type of
conscription force is inevitable just
as soon as some group has the
courage to bite the bullet and face
the facts,.because the all-volunteer

forceis a disaster/,’ Singlaub said.’ ‘

Singlaub ‘answered questions
from local reporters Saturday

morning at the Greentree Marriott’

Inn, where Singlaub was a guest
speaker at the fall conference of the
Pennsylvania‘ chapter of the "Re-
serve Ofﬁcers Association of the
United States.

The retired Major General

‘disagreed with statements by the

secretary of the Army and the
secretary of defense, who called the
volunteer army a success.

“The secretary of the Army and

4 the secretary of defense have been

laudatory of the volunteer army,
saying we are getting all the people
we need, getting adequate quality
based on the number of high school
graduates entering the service,”
Singlaub said. The fact that many of
the high school graduates now are
functional illiteratcs seems to have
been overlooked.”

Singlaub said the Army is being
forced to write instruction manuals
at a sixth grade level, because
recruits_no longer can read at the
level, where the
manuals are written now. . He also
stressed that the volunteer Army
has resulted in the decimation‘ of

reserve units.

“Most important is. the fact that

the all-volunteer Force has elirnin-' "

ated any eeincenﬁve _. for ~.P?.9P.1§; ,§9_ .- . .
said ‘ ‘

serve‘ in the reserves,”
Singlaub. » The pool of-’ trained
manpower is drying up. Individual
ready reserve used in the event of
emergency is down to well under
l00,000”now, and we need about

‘half a million of the ﬁrst 30fdays of a

NATO contigency. That’s a direct
result of the elimination of‘ the
draft.” ‘ H

Singlaub did admit that American

troops are‘ much more technilogi- .—

cally capable than Soviet troops.

A ‘ ‘Every guy or gal who comes into
the Army is capable of driving some
kind-of vehicle,” he said.
not true in the Soviet Union. This is

one area we should exploit by‘ giving ,

our forces technologies that can
overcome the great mass of
quantitative superiority the Soviets
have.” .- . . 1

Singlaub stressed that the United

States’ disadvantage in'troop'

qualitycan be useful only if the size

-ofthe U.S. and Soviet forces are

nearly equal. Now,’ he added, the
Soviets have too great a military-
advantage over America.

The Soviets have five times the
number of tanks we (NATO): have
in Europe,” he explained. ‘fWe
need some really outstanding
technology to overcome that.”

When asked to defend his

- criticism of the delayed develop-

ment of theneutron bomb in light of
criticisms; from the head of Pitt’s
Center for Arms Control and
in_Joseph International’ Security
Studies, Dr. Coffey, Singlaub said
the neutron bomb is needed to
superiority in tanks. That theory is

‘ based on facts'given to General

Haig, commander of the NATO
forces, and to America’sANATO
allies. -

“It may be that he (Coffey) has
more technical knowledge than the
people who are advocating the
production of the neutron bomb,”

. Singlaub said." “I’m just basing my
_~”"argur"nents on the arguments to the
‘NA-T0 halfinns and General Hai”g.~”,

“That’s ,

Health Service Merger 

Ready for SGB Voie

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pm News Staff Writer

The proposed Peer Medical Aid a
Programl—Student ‘Health Service
merger will be ﬁnalized by a
Student ‘Government Board vote
according -to, SGB
member David Hesidence’.

The details of the mergerwere
mapped out at a meeting'Friday
between Hesidence, Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs William
Markus’ and representatives from
the Student Health Service and the
Student Health Advisory Board.

Hesidence said representatives
“went overspeciﬁcs of a compro-
mise,” and that “the responsibility
of PMAP will go from the (Student
Go.vernm'ent)‘Board to the Student
Health Advisory Board.” _

The advisory board, which had
consisted of undergraduate and
graduate volunteers, was re-
organized at Friday.’-is meeting to

incorporate input from three.

student governments‘ on campus.
The advisory board now will
consist of one representative from

Retired General Singlaub PredicisRe1urnioPeocetimeDrcift

reporters at a press conference Saturday.

Coffey, a former U.S. Army
colonel, has publically stated in the
past that the delay of production of

the neutron bomb will not“ seriously -

harm the United States’ ability to

defend western Europe from’ any ‘

“Soviet ‘ground attack. 

Coffey also has pointed ‘out that
other anti-tank devices, such as
precision guided missiles,
helicopter-sown mines and changes
in attack response patterns, still are
being developed by the U.S. Army

and that these weapons could stop -

any armoredassault by the Warsaw
Pact nations. ~

Sin glaub cited ﬁgures throughout
the conference to show the U.S.
military is now inferior to Soviet
forces. He denounced the
anti-defense philosophy in-some
parts of the government as
unrealistic.

“The Soviets today are militarily
superior to us,” he said.

“The .
_ degree of , -superiority may be _
V‘ argued, but thelfact itself is not '

deniable at all by any one.’ _There is I
_an element that has been both

anti-defense and unrealistic in their
hopes that by demonstrating
disarmament the Soviets will do the

same thing.” .
Singlaub said the Soviet Union
has not slowed its defense

production but increased it. He
added that the weapons systems the
Soviets have developed in recent
years have been offensive, not
defensive, weapons.‘

“Most of the systems they are ‘
building now are offensive,” he
said. “They don't need a great ﬂeet
of attack submarines. They have no
need for them, but they do know
The United States and her allies are
wholly dependent on the use of the
sea lanes for their survival. By
having this great attack force, they
are able to subject us to pressures
that would make what Germany did

   Reporter Fil/es Brutal Charge Against Policeman

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer

Ed Tack, a reporter for The Pitt
,News, has filed charges of police

, , gbrutality .again'st officer Thomas,

I O’Connor, Pittsburgh City Police,
because the officer allegedly struck
him during an arrest for disorderly

" conduct last Sunday.

According to forms for Tack’s
arraignment proceedings, Officer
.0’Connor said Tack grabbed him
and attempted to spin him around.

.:;»O’Connor feared Tack was about to
harmzhiin, the report states.
a Then-sliolice Su.perintendent’s

Offi_ce»h_as confirmed that Tack has

ﬁled a complaint.with the Internal

,: it "~ O’Connor said he was unaware of

~ any charges filed against him. He
‘ declined to make any comment
about Tack’s claims of police
brutality.
Tack suffered a scalp laceration
,and dog bites to the buttocks, thigh,
arm and ankle when he allegedly
was clubbed during arrest for
disorderly conduct, harrassment,
assault and resisting arrest near the
Original Hot Dog Shop some time
between 12:30 a.m. and 1:15 a.m.
last Sunday. -
Tack said he was held after his

. rights, the police just laughed at

me,” said Tack. “Even the
magistrate laughed at me when I
mentioned my rights.”

The incidents leading to the
reporter's arrest began when Tack
noticed a group of policemen
gathered in the vicinity of the
Original while he was walking from
his old apartment on Bouquet Street
to his new apartment on Bigelow.
Boulevard. He sensed “something
was going to happen.”

Tack decided to wait and watch.
Tack said he saw O’Connor,
approach a woman in the doorway of
the hot dog shop and order her to
remove her dog from the doorway.
Stan Jones, a man who stoodbeside
the woman, asked O’Connor why he
could demand this, and the officer
cited an ordinance.

' After the ﬁrst question, Jones
asked O’Connor several more.
O’Connor then grabbed Jones,
pulled him into the intersection of
Forbes and Bouquet and struck him
with his night stick, according to
Tack. C

The reporter also said he saw no
reason why. the officer had to strike
Jones. “Joneswas not abrasive to
the officer as far as»I could tell,”
Tack said.

When O’Connor stopped striking
Jones, Tack addressed him from
where he was standing, not more
than 15 feet away from the police ‘
officer.

that, he claims the officer struck
him and knocked him to the
pavement on Bouquet Street next to

Another proposal for restructur-
ing the advisory board was dropped
Friday, because it created a,
situation "involving too many
advisory groups, Hesidence said.

IIASO a restilt of the merger, the

Peer M_edical Aid Program now will
-be funded by monies from the

student health, fee. The. medical

' aid _ program, student run and

offering emergency aid and med-
ical Acounsieling", wasformerly an
arm of SGB’s Medical Action
Committee until that committee
disbanded last April. Although the
medical aid program’s budget now
will be funded by the student
health fee, Hesidence said it would
not add any increase to the current
$16 fee. ' ~

Hesidence said the budget was
only‘ $40 last year,- and he said
there are no plans to increase it.

“I can see some expansion (of
the budget), and obviously they
won’i keep asking for — $40,”
Hesidence said, “I don’t se_e any
big jump in the amount of money
they will need.”

Present at Friday's meeting were

I Joe Roberts, - chairman ‘of the

Student Health Advisory Board,
health educator Bob~La Civita and

Singlaub Claims Defense Too

The retired ' major general
criticized Sen. George McGovern’s
recent statements, which called for
an invasion of Cambodia to end
repressive communist rule there. .

‘ ‘George McGovern is as guilty as
anyone for the communization of
Cambodia. For him to show concern
for Cambodians now is incredible to
me; it’s the height of two-
facedness,” Singlaub said.. “I
think ‘it’s irresponsible.”

Favoring the

    Home Rule

  Charter

WhengAllegheny County voters enter the.voting
booths on: election day and shut the drape’ behind
them, tligifichoiceifor governor will not be the only
questioif {must decide. County residents also
ghave,_.§lJ;,':t;i1

'\ .1

aiice to vote yes. or not on the County's

.propose"cl:,ltome rule charter when they cast their

  ballots.Nov. 7. '

If ‘approved, the charter would. completely revamp,
the structure of county government. Allegheny
County would cease to be governed by three com-
missioners with both legislative and executive powers
and by the gackle of —row,ofﬁcers who now reign

from the medieval «- monstrosity of the county cour-

thouse. A g I
The home rule charter proposes to replace the
commissioner system with a nine-member legislative

‘council to be elected by district, every four years.

An elected county executive with a four-year tenure
will, head theexecutive branch of Allegheny County

5 government if the charter is approved. He will have

the power to prepare the budget, nominate depar-
tment heads, negotiate contracts and speak on behalf

of the county to the state and federal governments.
Any change. from the commissioner system—as
much an anachronism in 20th century Allegheny
County as the squat labryinth of the county cour-
thouse is among the skyscrapers in downtown Pit-
tsburgh——would be a welcome innovation in county
government here. Three men. could be trusted with
the maintenance of government when Allegheny
County was a pastoral region, but now it seems un-
wise to allow three commissioners to handle all the

complex issues the county now faces. A new system
‘of government that instead places the county in the

hands of nine representatives" and one executive

‘seems much more suited to the present day.

Not only could the charter give the county moreref-
ﬁcient government, but it could reduce government
budget. A study by the Pennsylvania» Economy
League shows “the county would spend 4.32 percent
less on salaries under the Home Rule Charter, a
savings of $48,104. ‘Although the amount isn’t
much, any scheme that can give burdened taxpayers a

break deserves a yes from voters. .

A If approved by voters, the charter also promises t
help end patronage and give citizens a chance to par-
ticipate more in government through the establish-

. ment of_ initiatives and recalls. Article 10 of the«char-

ter allows the establishment of a personnel code" that

_ requires county employees to be chosen on the basis

of ‘merit, fitness and demonstrated ability. Such a
system would be a refreshing switch from .the present
system that allows pe’ople’t.o get jobs according to
whom they know—-not what they know.

Initiatives give people a chance to prod elected of-
ficials to approve new ordinances or repeal existing

ones—an act voters should have available to them
when all other petitions to the government fail to
illicit action. Provisions for recall supply voters with
the chance to remove from office any elected officials
who have proved themselves to be totally incom-
petent in their positions-—-a situation that happens
occasionally in local government.

The feat of “metropolitanism” is the only strong '

argument presented against the charter, but that
argument becomes a false issue when the home rule

' proposal is studied closely. The charter does not give

county government any power over the local
municipalities. They remain autonomous bodies and
can refuse to participate in any county services if they
wish. .

Allegheny Countyvoters have everything to gain
and nothing to lose if they vote for the..charter_on
election day. We urge every Allegheny 'Countian to
vote yes on the home rule referendum.

‘standoff.

It was the end of a year-long
V MOVE, a radical
back-to-nature group, vs. the city of

--Philadelphia, in particular, and
modern society in general.
. confrontation ended in the early

The

morning hours of Aug. 8, amid a

’ ﬂurry of gunﬁre. After two minutes

of heavy corssﬁre one Philadelphia
policeman layﬁ dead and one
seriously wounded. Less seriously

wounded were six more policemen, '

ﬁve ﬁremen, two MOVE members

and three MOVE-supporters. One

wonders who—if anyone—won.
The scene was Powellton Village,

E ‘at west Philadelphia neighborhood

located beside the University of
Pennsylvania campus. In the early

. 197'0’s<the FBI concentrated on the
“neighborhood in the ‘search .for

anti-war burglars who broke into
the FBI ofﬁces in Media, Pa.
About this time a friendly, soft-
spoken black man wandered
around the neighborhood discus-

sing his philosophy with anyone
who cared to listen. He was Vincent
Leaphart, MOVE founder, who, in
the words of one area resident, was
“interesting and intelligent”.
Slowly, he collected a group of
followers and they purchased the
compound at 307-309 North 33rd
St., Powellton Village. —
Calling themselves MOVE’

(standing for nothing in particular),
they began living a back-to-nature
philosphy. MOVE vmembers
adopted the‘ ,. surname “Africa,”
rejected modern technology and
electricity, allowed their hair to
grow freely, refused to use soap and
rejected burial. They denounced
the concept of time, listing their
ages as 1. If meat was eaten, it was
usually chicken, and supposedly all
food was eaten raw. All stray dogs
were welcomed, and it was a
practice to feed “our" rats, which
soon proliferated the compound.

‘ MOVE attempted to spread its
doctrines. In a yellow school bus,
members traveled to public meet-
ings- and directed obscenities at

' members.

whoever happened to‘ be speaking.

They managed to be so disruptive
that over a seven-month period 40
active MOVE members were
arrested more than 150 times,
sentenced to several years in jail

‘and fined more than $15,000.

But what ﬁnally brought /the
situation to a head were neighbors’
complaints of a strong, offensive
odor andthe large number of rats.
The city obtained permission from
the state Supreme Court to check
the ‘MOVE compound for health,
housing, ﬁre, zoning and safety
codeviolations. On May 20, 1977,
city inspectors attempting to enter
the houses "-were met by khaki
dressed, heavily-armed MOVE
Within an hour 200
equally armed policemen were on
the scene. ‘ ’ ‘

Mayor Frank Rizzo’s ﬁrst reac-
tion was to order a police raidof the
compound, but cooler heads
prevailed. The city began the long
trek through the judicial system. In
the incident, 141 MOVE members

i

 

  

"K -5-. .
-1.5‘ &

i g V _ ) . _______.
g-“HOW DID YOU GUESS THAT I’M A FRES MAN?"

    

were charged with firearms viola-
tions.‘ 1 -

So the standoff began. MOVE.
members refused to move from the
compound and could not be served
with the warrants by the police, who
did not enter the compound for fear
of a shootout. A 24-hour
surveillance was placed on the
compound. The situation remained
unchanging and pressure grew on
city ofﬁcials to end it. _

On March 1, i978, Philadelphia
Common Pleas Court Judge G.
Francis Di Bona approved a full
scale blockade of MOVE. After the
state Supreme Court refused
several appeals, the barricades
went up on March 16.’

As the blockade continued,

. MOVE members decided it was

against their beliefs to eat any food
from outsiders. Food placed on the
porch by city and social organiza-
tions was kicked to the dogs. Fears
rose "as MOVE members announced
that not even the children would
eat.
Palmer and Monsignor Charles
Devlin began negotiations between
MOVE and the police in hopes of
reaching-a peaceful settlement.
Finally, on May 3, a 10-point

g agreement was reached. The key

points called for MOVE to" vacate
the Powellton Village compound
within 90 days, all weapons were to

. be surrendered and MOVE mem-

bers who were involved would be
arrested for the May 20, 1977
‘incident. In return, the city lifted
the blockade, allowing MOVE
membes to come and go as they
pleased. ,

The’ city watched tensely as the
agreement was carried out. As the
MOVE members routinely were
arraigned, the city breathed a sigh
of relief. Speculation arose about

where MOVE would go next.

Slowly, MOVE disappeared from
the front pages and, as it is wont to
do, the public forgot. Then Aug. 1
and the 90-day limit approached,
and interest slowly picked up.
MOVE, once again, refused to
move. Judge Di Bona then issued
an order t’o arrest all MOVE

Community leader Walt’

members still in the Powellton

Village‘ compound for contempt.

within 10 days. On Aug. 7 city
ofﬁcials decided to go through with
a raid to carry out the order.

Shortly before 5 a.m. on Aug. 8 '0

Philadelphia ﬁremen set a high-
pressure deluge gun in front of the
house,.and policemen led approxi-
mately l0 MOVE supporters away
from the sidewalk in front of
MOVE’s barricaded compound. A
bulldozer appeared, and at 6 a.m._ it
began tearing away the fence
around the compound‘ that re-
mained in violation of the May 3
agreement. Half an hour later a
crane began knocking out the
barricaded windows on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor.. A few minutes before 7 a.m.
15 members of the Philadelphia

stakeout squad (Philadelphia’s_
SWAT team) entered the house.

Over the next 15 minutes, 30 more
stakeout members entered. Police
searched the three floors andfound
all MOVE occupants had retreated
to the basement.

_ Firemen then bought up axes and
tore away the barricaded basement

windows. As they‘ did throughout .
, police called on‘

the morning,
MOVE to surrendervonly to be
answered by obscentities. At 7:50

-a.m. the deluge gun opened up, and

within ﬁve minutes there were 16

-inches of water covering the

basement floor. At 7:55 a.m. police
radio reported guns had been

i sighted inside the basement. At 8

a.m. all doubt was removed when a

riﬂe poked out a basement window. 5/

Ten minutes later, four shots were
ﬁred from the basement. Exposed
police and ﬁremen were hit by
MOVE fire. Although police
returned ﬁre, no MOVE members
were hit. Q
When police radio reported
several stakeout squad members
were trapped on the ﬁrst floor,
police were ordered to cease ﬁre
and MOVE soon followed suit,
ending the shooting for good. Tear
gas was then ﬁred into" the
basement. Finally, MOVE began
responding to calls of surrend-

er. Within two hours, five
men, seven women and 11 achildren
emerged from the basement.

Police found two .45 caliber and
three .233 caliber semi-automatic
pistols, two .30 caliber riﬂes, one
7.65 mm Argentine Mauser riﬂe
(later determined to be the gun that
killed officer James Ramp) and
1,400 rounds of ammunition from
the house. The 12' adults were
charged with murder, multiple
counts of attempted murder and

_ weapons violations (they face trial
we . .
‘ sometime in 1979).

The children
were placed in foster homes.
There are lessons to be learned
from this. In the opinion of many,
there were several MOVE positions
that are correct, although oversta-
ted. For example, ‘ ‘When you have
crime, drug addiction and gangs
under an alleged state of laws, it is
your laws that are criminal,
’ addiction-inducing, gang-provok-
ing."’ One could arguethat the
problem is oversimpliﬁed and
somewhat distorted, but is_'it any.

- more oversimpliﬁed or distorted

than a politician promising to clean

up crime by pouring more money ’
ﬁinto law enforcement?‘ MOVE was ‘

certainly within their Constitutional
rights to hold to whatever personal
philosophy they wished.

But, however supportive one is
of any,‘ or all, of MOVE’s stands it
is difficult to justify its methods.
Move members showed absolute
disregard for their neighbors. If

they wante'd'_toi.,make a statement"

by living their beliefs, perhaps they
should not’ have chosen a crowded
inner‘-city area. The rats were

genuine ‘health threats, especially '

to the children of the community.
Using ‘guns-‘to keep the inspect-
ors and ‘police out was also wrong.’

*9‘ If one ‘decides to undertake a civil

disobedience protest‘ one‘ must
accept ‘the penalties.
But what tops the
complaints‘ is MOVE members
demandingtheir right to live as
they please while totally disregard-
ing the fact that their neighbors-
" the city in which they chose to live
andmodern society in general——-
also have rights. ,-
regarded promises it made at the
end ‘of the city’s blockade ‘knowing
the city andthe police would be

list of "

MOVE . dis-‘ s

forced to respond as they did.
MOVE members brought guns ‘to
the house AFTER they had agreed
to leave. They had, it would seem,
no ‘intention of leavingas prom-
ised.

Five days before the shootout,
Delbert -Africa was quoted as
saying, “He (Rizzo) has still got
the Cisco Kid image. We’re not’
giving up. He’s goirrg to get his fat’
face pictured all over the Untied
States asthe killer _of black women
and‘ children.” ,Devlin, ‘in ‘a
Philadelphia Inquirer interview,
said that MOVE members saw
themselves as catalysts in a1 world‘
wide revolution, ‘that once they

_ began resisting,‘ groups all over the

world would follow MOVE’s lead.
Taking ‘ into‘ account "any ' positive
ideas MOVE had, its conduct did
not‘ justify its positions.’ Give
MOVE a D minus.

. MOVE can be critized on many’
points’ but Rizzo was not what one
would call a model leader. Within
a few hours of the shootingwith

tensions still high after the

shootout, there was Philadelphia’s
fearless ruler saying,‘ “Here is as
group who for months said ,the

police were out to kill them. _ ,

The only’ people hurt were “the
police. Only in a‘ democracy would
they get away with what they’ve
done.‘..that’s the trouble with this
countr'y——we’re backing‘ off 'too
much.” - — »

Rizzo is right——-thereis not‘ way
to deal with any MOVE—type group
determined to have a showdown;
but by ' the same token, ‘if’ the
authorities are determined to have
a showdown, one will ﬁnd ‘a scene '
much like that of Chicago during‘
the 1968 Democratic Convention. '

v No matter if MOVE could have -.

been dealt with peacefully or not’,
Mayor Rizzo showed poor judge=
ment ‘in making’ an inﬂamatory
statement ' so soon ‘after the
incident.‘ One ‘ of government"s ‘
responsibilities is maintaining
calm. In a crisis"situation.the
leader of the government should be
stressing. ‘cool-headed responses on '
the part of the city-residents’, not‘
blowing his top. Give Frank a D.
So, we come to the police. The
police should be comended‘ for 99
percent of their actions.‘ -Over a .

' year-long period, despite continual

verbal abuse, not one policeman
reacted to the provocation and
started an incident. The police
exposed themselves to risk, per-
haps out» of concern ‘for the
children. ‘Police simply could have
ﬁred massive amounts’ of.-tear gas
into’ the basement (they did so after
the shooting stopped) but instead
attempted to carry out Judge Di
Bona’s order without force. But for
all the good work the police did,
there was an incident.‘ New photos
show Delbert Africa with arms
upriased, being ‘hit with a helmet,
kicked while on the groundand
dragged by the hair. Police‘ may
have been justiﬁed inhitting ‘Africa
with the helmet and‘ dragging
him—the ﬁringhad just stopped
when Africa crawled out of the
basement, ‘and police had no way of
knowingthat he was not’ a decoy
designed to draw them into‘ the
open.‘ There was not’ tactical

reason for the police ofﬁcer to kick '

Africa-it seems to have been a
purely emotional’ response. True,
the policeman had just seen many
fellow ofﬁcers hit, but‘ does‘ this

justify any act of brutality? .

This ,is.the only‘ complaint against‘

the _police inﬂthe long‘ standoff. 4

Give theipolice an A minus. ,

MOVE, the “city of Philadelphia, :

and ‘the police had the key roles in
the situation. "The report card
reads‘ D minus, D, A r_ninus——not'
what one ‘would _ call outstanding.‘
As of today, the city no ‘longer is
troubled with an ‘armed camp
in west Philadelphia drawing ‘away
‘vitally ’ needed policemen, and
MOVE did get -its positions
well-established but there was
THAT ending.‘ Let’s "hope other
radical groups learn from MOVE

that guns ’are_;_1ot‘ going to i,;’e1p;_,

let’s hope cityofﬁcials can learn to

- tolerate differing pointsof view and

respond only when the law is
broken and ‘ then respond ’ calmly
rather than ‘reacting; If both
groups genuinely want what is best
for society, it would seem both
sides must realize that . common
sense says compromise is the only‘
real solution.-' But as A.W.
Englehardt once observed:

“Among ’life’s many ‘mysteries,
‘I have often wondered'—why

we designate as ‘common-sense’
a trait in such short supply.” -

  Flying High
' : Fridays, 10 p.m.

(“Flying High" could be retitled
”‘‘Charlie’s Angels Become Air-

borne,” except that ABC’s famous ~ -

.__threesome (or foursome, depending
if L Farrah Fawcett-Majors is
guesting) can outact the three
. " vstewardesses from CBS on any
' given day. Plus, to make matters
worse, the original angels are much
better looking.

Despite CBS executives’ staunch
denials, “Flying High” is a blatant
rip-o

ultimately to themselves. ,‘

has capsulized in his characters the
dubious issue of white supremacy in
southern Africa today. By

instrumentals. “Last' Night,”
“Reds”, “Chains”. and‘ “Every-
thing” are rock’n roll tunAes,,,but
much better rock ‘n’ ‘roll has been
recorded; “Life Line” is a shallow
ballad with meaningless lyrics.
Other songs are hurt by other
faults, “Shock on the Tube” could
have been a great bet of

one blonde (Pat Klous) and two
brunettes (Connie Sellecca and
Kathryn Witte), who portray,
respectively, Marcy, Lisa, and Pam.
The three girls, despite a Barbie
Doll monotony, have slight regional
differences—Marcy is from the
South (and playsthe dumb blonde
role to the hilt), Lisa is a society
sophisticate (and tries her best to
mimic Kate Jackson), and Pam is
the city girl from New Jersey (and, if

she could act, is supposed to

‘provide a balance between the other
two).

Their adventures at Stew U.
(well; even McDonald's has a
training ground University)and
early days at Sunwest Airlines duly
were reported in an introductory

‘Flying High’ Doesn't Get Off the  Grou,nd

something too personal to ignore. In
an outstanding dramatization, the
audience actually is seized into the
empty lives of the brothers’ burning,
restless spirits.

The black brother, Zachariah,
played by Damien Leake, is a
supressed laborer who is frequently
ill as a result of his ardent efforts to
afford himself, at the very most, a

.meager means of survival. The only
exception to his monotonous

"lifestyle is his recent correspon-

dence to a female penpal who not
only awards him a short span of

/

surrealism—if 10cc hadn’t decided
to tell you in the last line “I’d been
dreaming all the time.” The group
makes the surrealism too obvious,
as if it felt the average listener
wouldn’t be able to understand
without a concrete explanatiion.
The worst cut is “From Rochdale
to Ocho Rios,” a Mexican folk song
mimickry with rinky-dink guitar and
stupid lyrics. The song is an
attempt to be clever, /but it only
slightly amuses.
There are some good cuts,
however, the best being "Old

episode aired earlier this fall. The
pilot proved to be‘ one of most
insipid previews in the history of
mindless television shows. While
CBS sacked two episodes that were
intended to open the regular season
for “Flying High” as being
unacceptable to the , viewing
audiences, the show that aired last
Friday ‘night reafﬁrms the belief-
that CBS execs have no taste. '
What happened was the girls
were trying frantically to elude a
pack of itchy-pawed, leering
legionnaires on a plane trip and
later at a luxury hotel. Mixed into
this was a policeman (Rosey Grier)
trying to transfer a prisoner to a
different prison. Naturally, the
killer slips past Grier until Marcy, in

humor but also a great deal of
disruption.

‘David Little plays the white
brother, Morris,‘ a man who has
returned to his home after spending
rrany long years trying to live the

white mans’ life. Inside the logic of "

his quiet guilt, Morris tries to help
Zachariah by becoming his house-
keeper and frugally’ saving the
"earnings of Zachariah for some

future ideal of someday owning -a‘

farm. Both brothers exist as social
outcasts and have absolutely

Mister Time”—a tale of a hermit
criticized by those around him. The
lyrics are touching and full of
meaning, while the arrangement is
smooth with grand piano and cello
accompaniment,

“Tokyo” is also impressive. A
soft rock number, the song keeps an
oriental ﬂavor viarwind chimes and
bass zither, but_ that ﬂavor isrl’t

ing the song to verge on mystical."

nothing in this world but each other.

The last line of the play clearly
shovv's this observation as Zachariah
asks of Morris: “Morrie, is there no
other way?” Morris solemnly
replies “No. ”

“Blood Knot” is a well-construc- - ~

ted, duly thought-out piece and is
worthy of the exceptional actors
who have successfully shaped.‘ it
from pen to stage.

Opening the fourth season for the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre, “Blood
Knot” will run through Oct. 29.

cut, is a reggae number in which the
arrangement overshadows the ly-
ric; “The Anonymous Alcoholic” is
the lone clever cut that works,
mixing blues and upbeat rock to
appropriately match the lyrics’

subject matter—getting drunk at a _

dance party.

But there are more poor_songs
than good songs—-and for an album
to be of high quality, the ratio must
be opposite. This is where
“Bloody Tourists” fails. And for

Two songs are above average.

“Dreadlock Holiday,” the opening-

a daring display of heroism, ﬁrmly
handcuffs herself to the prisoner.
What is puzzling about this is why
the stewardesses of America
haven’t been protesting. After all,
they made United Airlines’ dispose
of the infamous “Fly Me”
commercial, and have won several
battles against sexist hiring
practices. And “Flying High”

such an imaginative group like 10cc,
it's abloody disappointment.

likely won’t be ‘grounded by the

ratings, eit_her—CBS slated the
show -in‘, their , nowhereland of late

, ‘Friday nights, where it bucks the

second half of ABC’s Friday Night’
Movies and NBC’s “Eddie Capra
Mysteries.” So even if 3 most
viewers don’t opt to ﬂy Sunwest,
Klous, Sellecca,'and Witte may be
“Flying High” into ‘another season.

A promise from Pitt quarterback
Rick Trocano is as good as money
in the bank.

The day before‘ the Panthers
20-16 come from behind win over
North Carolina Saturday- at Pitt

,-”."Stadium, Trocano and head coach -

Jackie Sherrill had a little powwow.

“Maybe it’s my fault more than
anything else,” said Sherrill
“During fall camp, I wanted Ricky
to come to the front so bad, but I
wouldn’t just give him the job. We
had a talk yesterday,
promised he'd win the gamefor
me.” -

And win the game is just what he
did for the 50,439 in attendance as

well as scouts from the Orange and

Liberty Bowls.
Once again, Pitt employed its

. “Temple offense” in the ﬁrst

quarter—marching the ball down
the ﬁeld on the ‘ﬁrst possession

‘ﬁbefore fumbling within the shadow

of. the goalpost.

The Tar Heels entered the game
plagued by offensive problems, but
during the Panthers ﬁrst drive, it

appeared North Caroliina would

V have something else to worry about. -
Pitt chose to test Carolina’s rushing '
defense’ and kept the ball on the .

ground for its ﬁrst 18 plays.
Everything was there during‘ that

ﬁrst series—the consistent move-

ment downﬁeld Sherrill wanted, -the

a sizeable holes in the’ ‘Tar. Heel

defense the runners wanted and the
extreme probability.of an early Pitt

lﬁlead the bettors wanted. ‘Unfortun-

ately, there’ was also something
North Carolina head coach Dick
Crum wanted, a Trocano fumble
inside the 1-yard line. , ' .

‘ ‘I never fumbled that much in my
life,” Trocano said about his five
fumbles. “It was just a bad day for
holding onto the ball. _0n third
down (before the first fumble) I was

_ in the end zone, but that’s'just my

opinion.” A
Suddenly, as if stricken ‘by .a

contagious disease, Pitt found itself

coming up inches short on several

NEW YORK— The New York Jets’
biggest fear yesterday was that

key plays. It is a well known fact
that unless one is throwing hand
grennades, inches short minght as
well be yards short.

On’North Carolina’s ﬁrst puntof
the game, Pitt’s Ricky Jackson
came‘ within the length of Joe
Patemo’s nose of getting a hand on
the kick. The Pitt defense almost
stopped the first Tar Heel scoring
drive twice before it got within ﬁeld
goal range. On a fourth-and-one,
quarterback MattvKupec caught the

_ Panthers waiting for» the defensive

call from the sidelines and darted
over tackle for the first down. And
on the play before Jeff Hayes gave
Carolina a 3-0 lead, Hugh Green let
an interception slither through his

1 hands.

The offense had tow more

‘f ﬁrst-halfTdri'ves stopped by almost-
itis. On a third-aind-18 from the Pitt ~

12, Trocano found Gordon Jones
slanting over the middle for 17‘/2
yards, which only meant Joe
Gasparovic would have more
breathing room to punt. ’
After ‘a 5-yard punt by Hayes on

the ensuing possession, the Pan-.

thers appeared to be in good
position to put some points on the
board before intermission. On
fourth down at the Tar'Heel 31-yard
‘line, Trocano again found Jones on
th_e quick slant, but after Jones lost

. thehandle at the 15, Buddy Curry

recovered for Carolina:

Kupec was replaced by Clyde
Christensen after taking a shot to
the head in the second period.
Ofﬁcially listed as a mild concus-
sion. Kupec would have found it

very difficult to play quarterback’
with the telephone ringing and no 1

one answering it. 
The third quarter had the teams

~ exchange turnovers, which led to an

exchange of touchdowns. Only Al
Chesley’s right arm allowed the
Panthers to _chop a point from the
Carolina lead by blocking Hayes’
conversion attempt, and Pitt was

down 9-7, going into the ﬁnal 15

minutes. a .

anticipation of the National League
championship series against the

The Phillies
clinched the division title with a
10-8 victory Saturday.

Moreno rapped a run-scoring
single in the Pirates’ four-‘run ﬁfth
inning and got the stolen base he
needed to break the club record of

70, set last season by Frank
Taveras.

Tekulve pitched the ﬁnal two
innings in'- breaking the.» former
Pirates’ record fo 30 saves set by
Dave Guisti in 1970.

Moreno leads the major leagues
in stolen bases and Tekulve topped
all pitchers with 91 appearances.

went- 0-for-1 before going to the
bench with a .334 batting average,
gaining his second consecutive

the fifth. Dale Berra hit a solo
homer, his sixth, in the eighth
inning off Dan Larson. Winner

The first-quarter play ‘in which Rick Trocano believed he scor_e'd.,'

I had success with the pass so I
stayed with it, ’ ’ Bradshaw said after
throwing three TD passes in a game
for the sixth time in his career.

Swann roamed around downﬁeld

at will, winding up with seven

receptions for 100 yards.

-“The Jets take such, deep
drops—the linebackers 15 yards,
the secondary 20-25—that it opens
up the stuff» underneath all day
long,” he said.

With less than two minutes to
play and the victory well in hand,

1-Bradshaw suffered a bruised knee

and had to be helped off the field
after linebacker 4 Mike ’I-Iennigan
ﬂattened him on a pass play. ..

Coach Chuck Noll said he ordered
the pass because he felt Pitts-
burgh’s running game wasn’t
getting the first downs.

Bradshaw said he was surprised
he was in the game at all at that
point and said of the play that
knocked him out: “I don’t want to
argue that. It wasn’t my idea."

He hit Swann on a 10-yard scoring
pass in the ﬁrst period, found John

Stallworth on a 14-yarder to put ’

Pittsburgh ahead for good in the
second quarter, then connected
with Swann for 26 yards and a TD
early in the third period.

Pittsburgh’s other TD came on

something Saturday. For the first

penalty kick was converted by the
Owls. Temple had passed the ball
down_ the. left wing, where Hamm
tried to take control of the ball and
was called for pushing within the
18-yard line. Temple striker Mike
Gorni took the shot from the 12-yard
line and scored to even the game.

The score remained tied through-
out the rest of the evenly matched’
ﬁrst half.-

Twenty minutes into the second
half Temple went ahead as Owl
midﬁelder Scott Land took a corner
kick and headed the ball into the

coach Jackie Sherrill Friday after-
noon. '

“I had personal things to say to
him,” said Trocano, who was

‘booed by 45,000 fans and removed

from last week’s Temple game.
“Things ‘I had to get off my chest.”

. ' Sherrill agreed to listen.

“Trocano said to me, Coach, I—

Pitt Stadium) for you,’ ” Sherrill
claimed. 0

A 12-play, 80-yard touchdown

by a 13-yard Trocano-to-Fred

game. But why did the Panthers
wait until the fourth quarter to
generate such offense?

“In the ﬁrst half they took away
the option,” Trocano said, “Which
we thought wasthe strong point of
our offense-. They‘ did things I
didn’t see before-—next time I see

The offense shut "out “by. the

said. “I put pressure on him.
I wanted Rick to come to the front
so bad, but he jus_t.didn’t.- excel-.”

ﬁmiljhe pressure was obvious:
Trocano fumbled ﬁve times in the
game, further stalling any Panther
scoring dri_ves.

Pitt’s women’s volleyball team

has become hooked on the winning
habit, as it has yet to.lose a game
I this season.

The Pantherettes came out on top
.; of a ﬁeld of 17 teams at the Temple

12 straight games, Pitt beat teams
comparable to the ones it will be
competing against‘in the Eastern
Regionals this year. s

Pitt was in a “pool” with Navy,
East Stroudsburg State.and Brook-

lyn College. The teams in each pool .

played each other twice, and the top
team went on to a quarterﬁnal
round. Pitt_ defeated Navy, 15-9 and
15-13, then beat East Stroudsburg

grand Brooklyln by identical scores of

15-6‘and 15-8.

In the quarterﬁnal round Pitt
bested Delaware, 15-11 and—15-9.
The semiﬁnals had the Pantherettes
matched against last year’s Eastern
Regional champions, Maryland,

which ‘Pitt handled easily, 15-3 and
15-6.’ ' '

Pitt then moved_on to the ﬁnals
against host Temple and took a 6-0
advantage in the ﬁrst ,g_arr_ie.
Despite . ‘ant ankly injury to
co-captain Cindy Chambers. Pitt
went on to win, 15-6, but struggled
in_ the second game before putting
the Owls away, 16-14.

F “The thing that most impressed
me was the way the girls continued
their aggressive play after Cindy’s
injury,” said Pitt head coach Mike
Hebert. V

Hebert cited the play of Ingrid
Mueller, Maria Perez and Cham-
bers as “dominating.”

“Even though we’re still hurting,
we really dominated this touma-
ment,” Hebert said.»

Earlier in the week the Panther-
ettes destroyed a hapless Duquesne
team, 15-2, 15-7 and 15-4. After
that ‘match, Hebert said he wouldn't
know how strong his team is until
the Temple tourney because of
Duquesne’s lack of strength. V Now
he knows. ‘ I , - -  I

goal. Unnerved, the Panthers did

not challenge Temple again. .
With 25 minutes left in the game,

Temple scored two more times to

‘ keep its record unblemished at 3-0. _ T

The third Owl goal came when

‘midﬁelder Joe Steffa ﬁred from

close yardage. With ﬁve minutes
remaining Steffa scored again when
he headed the ball in from the
8-yard line.

_ Temple A coach John Boles be-
lieved the Panthers let go after the
second Owl goal. , '

“In the second half we ‘wore Pitt

scored that second goal, and then
Pitt simply let go.” '

Boles did give some credit ‘to
Panther individuals, “midﬁelders
Johnny O'Hara and Karl Nigh
played well for Pitt,” said Boles.
“They played a- hard game and had
the rest of the team looking to‘
them.” -

Panther coach Leo Bemis agreed
with Boles about Panthers’ indi-
vidual efforts. - P‘

- “We had a great deal of
individual effort being shown out

quarters and the Panther offense
stumbled. Until the fourth quarter’.

(Continued from page 11)
combining the run and the pass to
record the longest touchdown drive

i of the season (85 yards) with Fred

Jacobs again scoring the touch-
down. " ‘

On the ensuing possession, the
Tar-Heels were victimized by Bill
Neill and Dave Logan who
accounted for the Carolina offense’s
seven-yard reversal, and it ap-
peared Pitt had gained control of the
game.’

- ~After the 44-yard Carolina punt,
two option plays gave the Panthers
a ﬁrst down on the ofvn 24
Trocano, whose hands seemed to be

. made of concrete, put the Tar Heels

back in the game with "his ﬁfth
fumble at the Pitt 24-yard line.

After the Tar Heels regained the
lead on a two-yard run by Doug
Paschal, Pitt’s hopes for a third
straight win were dimmed consider-
ably.

After the kickoff, the ball Sat 80
yards from victory, there were less
than ﬁve minutes to get it there and
Pitt had but one timeout remaining.
Two acrobatic receivers and one
very poised'quarterback made it all
happen.

“When we went out on the ﬁeld
before that last drive, there wasn't a
lot of yelling and screaming,” said
Trocano. “We just looked at each
other, knew what we had to do and
just went down the ﬁeld.”

Trocano had suddenly trans-
formed himself from a college
sophomore info a quarterback who
could swap last minute comeback
stories with the most seasoned
veterans.

Officially, Trocano completed six
of nine passes for 83-yards and one

touchdown on the drive, but the
poise necessary to pull something
like that off‘doesn’t show up on any
stat ‘sheet.

Ralph Still started the storybook
ending by climbing a ladder to haul
in a pass and set the Panthers up
near midﬁeld. Under a heavy rush,
Trocano was unable to ﬁnd an
eligible receiver and had to take a
15-yard loss. Stabler—er—Trocano
came right back and found Steve
Gaustad for 25 yards and a first
down at the Tar Heel 28 yard line.

Sandwiched around an Gordon
Jones special (a diving catch over
the middle), Trocano was forced to
throw the ball out of bounds to stop
the clock. .

Jacobs, proving that scoring on
Saturdays is not limited to fraternity
parties, found an opening in the
secondary, and the Panthers had
themselves a 3-0 record.

“I think that ﬁnal touchdown
drive proved that Trocano can throw
the ball,” said Sherrill. “On the
touchdown pass to Jacobs, he
spotted his secondary receiver and
hit him. The biggest‘ thing Ricky
needs right now is conﬁdence, and
that ﬁnal drive should give him a lot
of it.”

Trocano ﬁnished the afternoon
with 16 completions on 27 attempts
for 59.1 percentage. No bank in the
world will give you more than that.

PITT NOTES: All the Carolina
pointscame after Pitt turnovers...
The Panther defense held Amos
Lawrence to 47 yards. . .The passing
attack ﬁnally showed some bal-
ance—-J ones grabbed ﬁve, Gaustad
and Still hauled in four apiece..._
Jones has now caught a pass in the
last 19 games. ~;
