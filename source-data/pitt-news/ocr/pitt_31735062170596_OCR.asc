New Meal Plan Supported  

by KAREN BURGIO

New University policies con-
cerning invoicing and voluntary
-meal plans were discussed at
Thursday night’s Student Govern-
ment meeting, the next to the last
one held this term. ' '

Starting this winter term or
next fall, invoices will be distri-
buted the same way grades cur-
rently are, in a folded envelope.
Because of this, the Student Di-
rectory will be included in the in-
voice mailing.. This means that a
separate mailing will not be need-
ed if the Student Directory con-
tinues to be published.

The University will back avoi-

 untary meal plan with aproposal

of allowing students of opting for
21, 15, 10, seven or no meals per
week/per term. However, if stu-
dents are allowed to choose no

board, there will be a crack

down on the use of hot plates and
keeping food in dorm rooms, for
since Carnegie-Mellon University
has begun a voluntary meal plan,
rats have been found in rooms.

_ Room rate will also increase
next year, not only due to a volun-
tary meal plan, but also because
of thenew Centrex system and

inflation.

President Tom Bailey announc-
ed his displeasure with the John
Roberts Ring Company, saying
that some rings ordered this July
have still not been delivered. Bail-
ey said he would take the matter
to the Better Business Bureau if
they are not delivered by Dec,25.

_ In a report from the Legal

Awareness Committee, Jeff Pas-.

ek said that Pitt will be host-’t0 a
national convention’ here from

' March 30 to April 2 of next year,

in an attempt’to set up similar
committees nationwide.

The Committee on Student Or-
ganizations recommended that
two new student groups be recog-
nized, the Students for Human
Life and the American-Irish. So-
ciety. SHL’s constitution was sent
back to committee, because Bail-
ey said it was too vague and cur-
rentli overlapped the purpose of
at least three existing organiza-

tions on campus. Terry Sadler op- '

posed the American-Irish Society,
saying that if one ‘ethnic group’
was allowed on campus, there
may well be dozens more. Sadler
contended that BAS had a differ-
ent purpose than merely ethnic
goals. The meeting was adjourn-

~Winter Applicants

APPLICATIONS are available for
membership in the Intercultur-
al House for the winter term.
Applications may be picked up ‘
at the Student Union Desk, the
Towers Desk, or at the Intercul-
tural House at 272 North Dith-
ridge St. A

The Intercultural House pro-
ject consists of ten white and ten
black students living together in
a fraternity house. environment
and working on specificproiects
in the University and the com-
munity.

Members receive a free room,
but must pay a board fee.
Scholarship preference is given
to house members who can dem-
onstrate financial need to the
Office of Student Aid.

STUDENTS may still register for
Educational Communications

tion of Instructional Systems.-
Students should pick up registra-
tion cards in Room 230, David

Students are encouraged to sign
up for additional freshman
studies courses during the drop/'
add period. ,

Students are asked to consider
changing to a seminar that relates
to their particular discipline if
they have signed ‘up for an 80's
course.

The 40 seminars relate to al-

.most every major department at

the University. For example,
there are seminars in Asian
studies; Conflict and Peace; So-
cial Justice and World Order; and
a course, "Mathematical Prob-
lem.Solving,” that would be val-
uable to any science major.

The program is recommended

.for students interested in a per-

sonalized teaching approach. in-
volvement in their own education,
and making new friends through
close student and student/teach-
er contact.

Classes are small and personal.

Students work on projects with

the kind of supervision not pos-
sible in a larger class and are pro-
vided with a background in re-
search technique that will prove
invaluable in all future studies.

The seminars are somewhat in-
terdisciplinary, breaking up a

‘ more general class into smaller,

related topics.

Freshman Studies courses fill
the distribution of studies require-
ments and in some cases count
towards the major. These semi-
nars are a personalized way of
escaping overcrowded lecture
halls and fulfilling the elective re-
quirements.

Instructors of _these seminars
are pleased with the results of the
f—irst~term. They reported a high-
er degree of participation and stu-’
dent cooperation. ' ‘

ter was reached.

Board Games Teach Court Strategy 

by‘JOYCE GEMPERLEIN
When a tennis ball comes whiz-

zing over the net at you just as

your socks droop, a shoelace
snakes to the asphalt, and your
sweatband slides over one eye,
you’d better be able to retain
some of your dignity.

The best way to redeem ; our-
self is to employ some strategy-—
a backcourt drive, an overhead
smash. or some shot calculated
to thoroughly astound your op-
ponent. .

Dr. Donald Mercer, a biochem-
ist and assistant professor of
Pathology in Pitt’s School of Med-
icine, feels such game strategy
and rules are best learned outside
the actual situation.

Last year Mercer began hark-
eting his solution to the problem-
a board game called “Advantage
Tennis—the Game of Singles."

This year two. others in the "Ad-
vantage" line—hockey and bas-
ketball—are on sale.

Mercer says his work on rules,
percentages, and charting was
tantamount to “doing a master’s
thesis.” It is easy to see why.

The three games, produced and
manufactured by a Pittsburgh
company, have been hailed by pro
shops and Scholastic Coach Mag-
azine as both valuable education
tools and exciting simulations of
the fast action of the actual
games. Each owe their fast play-
ing time to a unique. patented
"mobile spinner."

This spinner is moved by play-
ers to one of approximately 50 de-
cision making discs, each repre-
senting an aspect of the particular
game.

For example, in tennis the play-
er must decide which serve would
best suit his position at the time,
then move the spinner to that
disc.

Both the replica of the court.

and the spaces on the discs are

Aloni Lecture Covers
Israel Internal Strife

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Shulamit Aloni, Israel's answer
to Ralph Nader, appeared on cam-
pus Wednesday for an informal
discussion concerning internal
problems of Israel. Formerly a
member of Parliament. an activ-
ist in Israel's =Women’s Liberation
and Civil Rights movements, and
an advisor in the Consumer Pro-
tection Agency, Aloni lectured on
several controversial issues.

Speaking about discrimination,
she focused on the predicaments
of Jews from North Africa and
Palestinian Arabs. Reviewing
events since 1948. when the State
declared independence, Aloni‘re-
called that "many refugees from
Oriental states such as Morocco
came from a different society to
a westernized one without leader-
ship,” since the wealthier immi-
grants went to North America. Is-

For example, the landing space
for the spinner varies with the
riskiness of the shot. In tennis,
the faulting area on the power
serve disc is considerably larger
than that of the spin serve disc.

Included with the game board
and,_playing pieces are two books.
The first explains basic game
rules. The other, called “Shot
Profiles” is a. thick booklet of
diagrams, strategy, and termino-
logy about the actual sport.

'rae1, at that time a country of- 
only 600,000 Jews, “had to ab-
sorb 1,500,000 in a short period.‘

Since we couldn’t give them an

IQ test for jobs," she ‘explained, 

"we had to place them on welfare.

“Welfare ruins initiative,” she
stated. School. is free, “but since
families of Orientals _are so large‘,

it is difficult for a man living on  -=-‘I

welfare to support his family.

Children have to work rather than _ iii’,

attend high school, and they are
unskilled when they finish the
army. Poverty is a viscious cir-
cle.” . ‘V _

In Israel‘, unlike other societies,

she said, “Its patriotic to have  “

a big family. But to have a big
family, you must be rich. This is

why the Orientals have started to '

rebel." _ . I :

(Continued on Page 3) I I ' I

"and men I take horn out on‘~the" 

court and trounce him.”

Apparently Mercer’.s_ kowledge
of both strategy and form is ac-
countable. He is a former melm-.-at
ber of the Wheeling College "ten-

is team, has played at the West7

Virginia Open Tennis Tourna-
ment. He and his partner-heldthei

West‘Virginia state title for don- I

bles for several years. Also, play-_
ed basketball with the Wheeling
College team as an undergraduate.

DR. MERCER presents trophy to a young tennis strategist.

The games have been proven
to be ideal for the beginning play-
er who wants to learn the fine
points of the game and the home-
bound, advanced player who
wants to develop his knowledge of
rules and strategy.

To test this, Mercer selected
children in the Mount Lebanon
area and held his own tennis tour-
nament. Some had a cursory-
lege and others, none. The results
showed that athletic skills was not
necessary. -

"My ‘son will beat me." he said,

 

Mercer said his games, now on 
shelves in the Pitt Bookstore and 
downtown department stores. are p 

selling fairly well.

At first, Mercer said, coaches, 
and teachers were reluctant to"
forsake time in actual tennis, 
hockey, or basketball practice,_,.
for a sit-down game. Gradually,” '

after demonstrations at various

conferences, opens, and tours,'ac- 

ceptance‘ is easier to come by.

At least one coach is convinced.- .
Buzz Ridl, Pitt’s head basketball if

coach. Mercer said, has just or-’

. dered a dozen of-, the basketball
games! V

Co-operation

Plan Proposed

by SUSAN STEINBACK

President Richard Cyeizt of
Carnegie-Mellon University is ini-
tiating programs which include
cooperation between Hunt and
Hillman Libraries:
‘” A cooperation would reduce the
duplication of new acquisitions
and reference materials in both
libraries. “It appears to be un-
necessary as well as wasteful for
libraries within close proximity
each to spend, large amounts on
identical volumes." Cyert said.

I ~

President Cyert would also like ’

to invite Pitt to house their two
PDP-10 computers in the CMU
Computation Center to reduce op-
erating costs and increase facil-
ities available to both universities.

Nothing final has been decided
aboutiany of‘ these plans.

Present cooperation between
the universities includes a pro-
gram between ‘the Physics De-
partments. The two departments
hold joint seminars and share.
several grad courses. I

CMU’s Math Department has
already arranged for coordinating
first year graduate level courses
with Pitt. The department is also
considering sharing faculties for
higher level, and more specialized
graduate courses.

Glazer, Vernon Design
Urban Studies Course

by JOHN CAPITMAN

Walter Glazer of the History
Department and Phillip Vernon
of the Geography Department are
offering a new course that "will
apply to many different fields be-
cause of the importance of the ur-
ban scene in. America where our
greatest problems are urban
problems.”

Glazer and Vernon feel that
their Freshmen Studies course,
An Introduction to Urban Studies,
will "give both historicaland a
geographical perspective—th’ese
are the elements of time and
space and these are the two axis
on which we can give an answer
to the question, “What is a city'.”‘
as Glazer explained.

According to Glazer, the fact
that the professors in the Urban
Studies Program “come out of a
traditional sort of “background”
does not keep them from trying to
face the city in a broad inter-dis-
ciplinary manner. “It is this abil-
ity to know one aspect and see it
as a part of a whole that makes
for a real understanding of the
problems around us.”

As ‘Vernon explains, "The aca-
demic approach and the policy ap-
proach ‘are very different, our

‘role is removed from the policy
, makers

almost by definition."
The goal of the course then, is not
"to compete with GSPIA. but to
give people a general introduction
to urban society.” .
Glazer and Vernon feel that al-
though their course is of an aca-

demic nature. “the problems of _

the city are so complex that new
approaches to their history, char-
acteristics, and perhaps their sol-
utions, require new methods of
teaching."

The students will be given both
an academic and a personalized
view of the different aspects of
the field of Urban Studies, from
the process of urbanization, to the

Film Ival p

Pittsbu h Playhouse
resents‘

economic, ecological, social, and
political contexts of the city.

Those who take, the course will
be exposed to lectures. movies,
seminar-discussion groups, and
guest speakers, who as Vernon

‘suggested would give their own

understanding of the‘ various fa-
cets of the city and its problems.
“For example. for the module on
social contextsiwell have some-
body doing social work for the
city in a specific community come
and tell us what its like from his
perspective."

But the course will not be sole-
ly theoretic since students “will
have the possibility of taking ad-
vantage of their own backgrounds.
while they try to draw-up a kind
of tour-book of the various com-
munities in the Pittsburgh area.
using both factual and personal-
ized informations. their impres-
sions and how those impressions
fit into a factual understanding
of their communities,” explained
Glazer.

The guide of the Pi-tsburgh
area that could come out of the
Introduction to Urban Studies,
said Glazer would be both “impor-
tant to the students in the course
as a way to organize their own
perceptions of their communities,
but also as a service to anyone
else who wants to know about this
city.”

ELECTIONS to the Executive
Board of the Intra-Fraternity
Council were held Nov. 28, with
the following results: Jay Latter-
man, president; Bill Fulcher, in-
ternal vice president; David
Boko, external vice president;
Joe “Burke, secretary; and Jerry
Iwler, treasurer.

Aloni made clear that she is
"happy about the rebellion.” and
hopes that "many things will be
done to make things better.”

A civil rights advocate, she de-
nied that this problem has any-
thing to do with discrimination
against a minority. The Orientals,
she stressed, “are not a minor-

ity, but part of the Jewish peo- ‘

ple..7!

The problem clearly involving
the status of a minority group
which she touched on is that of
the Israeli/Arabs. Basically, she
asserted. “There are two ques-

tions: How do we deal with them, .

and what influence does relations
between the Arbas and Israelis
have on Israeli society?"

Noting that “income in the West
Bank is twice as high as it was
before." the Israeli government
assumed occupation during the
1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, Aloni
nevertheless mentioned several
iniquities. "No one wants to dis-
criminate,” she insisted, “but Is-
raelis became supervisors, while
Arabs do all the work. Though
Arabs are higher.
they’re lower than wages of Jews.
Arabs have been supplying cheap
labor.

Monday, December 4, l972—THE PITT N EWS—Page 3

Israel Subject of Lecture

“Cheap Iabor,” she continued,
“is now illegal. A West Bank Arab
must get the same wages and
benefits as Jews.”

Moreover. as a solution to this
problem, she recommended that
her government invest in more en-
terprises for the West Bank. This
way, she said Arabs “won’t have
to go to Jews for jobs.” I

Turning to the status of wom-
en, Aloni admitted that Israel in
1948 was “a paradise for women
economically, militarily, social-
ly. and politically; there was full
participation."

This started to change, how-
ever, in 1953, she said, as a result
of “propaganda for having many
children, advertising and the
mass media, and_ religious legis-
lation, which is important in mar-
riage and divorce and personal
status.” Referring to religious
marriage law, Aloni explained
that “a woman is a man’s proper-
ty,” she cannot be divorced with-
out her husband’s consent. “Un--
less a woman divorces her hus-
band according to Jewish law, she

is still his wife.”

An attorney, Aloni is currently
serving on the Constitutional
Committee for the Bill of Rights,
in assisting with what will be Is-
rael’s first formal body of law

she and her colleagues “are not

which will compromise on free-

dom of speech and conscience,” .. ff,-if

and emphasized that she'd prefer
delaying adoption of the legal doc-
ument to drafting it hastily. "It’s
better to postpone it than having
to change it later."

"‘It’s easy to look at a small
country like Israel, compare it
with other larger countries, and

Unavoidable Pollution

by MIKE 0’CONNOR

When someone mentions air pollution. we almost always
think of the steel mills, power companies, or Henr_y Ford. Some-
times the pollution gets so bad that we are forced to stay in
doors. For Pitt student indoors could mean, for instance. a
 lassroom full of unavoidable pollution for students who don't
%smoke. -

   
  
  
   
 
  
   
    
  
   
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
   
    
    
   
 
  
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
 
    
   
  
 
   
 
  

_ When a non—smoker enters a classroom he can usually
"breathe fairly well, at least the first 10 minutes. anyway. Then
_, he-smokers begin to light up. The girl next to you will undoubt-
edly be the first one. and surely the first puff of smoke from her
:.-extra long cigarette is aimed for your nose. '

Immediately your nasal passages begin to shrink and clog.
'."'l‘:imes passes, you’re 30 minutes into the class, your throat
,-"feels like sandpaper, your eyes are burning so badly you remove
3 your glasses. Your nose is closed completely now and every
?'few minutes you are forced to cough. You try repeating to your-
self, “The class will soon be over,” as nauseaibegins to churn
Sin the lower half of your body. .

You, closed your note book 10 minutes ago. because it was
_ rnpossible to see the professor through the smoke clouds. Your
.TImind feels foggy, almost as if someone had put a white screen
‘iiip to block its train of thought.

1 Finally everyone else closes their note books and begins to
leave. That's your signal to hurry out of the room: you've miss-
’d the assignment for the next class, but survival is basic. You
know you have enough carbon monoxide in your lungs to keep 50
green plants alive fora week. Hurry. get outside in the snow and
‘cold, take a deep brea/the. ' ’

-* But, don’t stay to long. because you have another round of
. unavoidable pollution to fight in 10 minutes.

Column and a Half

a by JOHN METCALFE
_ Just recently I flew to the West Coast and back. exciting the
’- envy of my friends and evenia few of my relatives. I learned many
_hings, a few were thought-provoking and some horrifying. First. the
iwhorrifying (let me indulge myself nd say horripilating. I've wanted to
"use that word ever since I learned it meant something so scar_y it made

‘” ’/ To fly from Pittsburgh to Los An-
Ageles and back, I had to depart from and arrive at the terminals
.. in ‘both cities, though at different times. As these events were not

lqences in the ways things are done in the two great cities. Pitts-
burgh comes off a rather poor second.

_ Baggage, for instance, In Los Angeles, you can't leave the
f-area where baggage is retrieved without passing a guard who checks
whether you have a claim tag corresponding to the piece of lug-
'_‘gage. you have just collected. This is a refinement which has yet to
l;.-Jreach Pittsburgh. Here you can take anything that strikes your fancy,
I and if the actual owner does not catch you in the act, it is yours.

_ ' But this is a mere bagatelle; it involves only personal property
and; no threat to life and comfort.

, .
, Lately, anyone who flies is likely to be aware of the consider-
able chance of being diverted to one or moreuodd destinations by
someone who has taken over the aircraft by force of arms and threat
of violence. The airlines and the federal government claim to be

iiidtials (and expensive airplanes). The effect is curiously uneven.

Letters to the Editor  

Black Stereotyping

To Whom It May Concern:

I remember from the days when
I was a kid how easily white peo-
ple tended to generalize about
black folk. For example: We all
liked jazz, never the classics or
the operas. Or. we were always
aspiring to be like some famous
athlete. ‘never a famous intellec-
tual——God forbid! And of course.
we were always a nice boy or
girl no matter how old we were.

Today, I find that white people
have hit upon a new generali-
zation. Consider the following
two cases: (1) While waiting to
be served at Winky’s the other day,
one of the counter help asked me
if I were a teacher at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Although I
did not know the prson, I none-
theless nodded affirmatively, and
said that I was presently teaching
a course in the School of Gen-
eral Studies. The person then pro-
ceeded to ask me if I knew Mr.

. . . Not knowing Mr. . . . I, naturally‘,

said no, The person gave me
somewhat of a surprised look and
remarked “He is in the Black
Studies Department.” (2) [asked
one of the clerks of the Reserved‘
Book Room at the Hillman- Li-
brary if a professor had put any
books on reserve in the past week
or so. The clerk inquired “For
what department—Black Studies?”

In neither of the two cases did
I perform any action, utter any
word, or have on any type of
clothing that would have given
even the most perceptive person
the slightest clue that I was a
member of the Black Studies‘
Department. Why? When I
attentively reflect upon the mat-
ter. I suppose the reason is that
I am a graduate student of the De-
partment of Philosophy.

The new generalization that
white people have hit upon is——
if one has not already guessed it——
that‘ to be black is to be, ipso
facto, a member of the'Black
Studies Department. I have noth-
ing against the Black Studies
Department, but as it turns out.
this particular generalization is
hardly true. This, I would have
thought. is quite obvious. At the
very least, I would have thought
that it is no less obvious than the
true statement “Not all blacks
look the same.” I am inclined to
believe that the truth of this state-
ment is prettyiobvious. I hope
that I am not wrong. /

, Sincerely.

' Fetus “Not Human”

Editor, The Pitt News:

To the extent that the "pro-life"
anti-abortion movement, as re-
ported in the Nov. 13 Pitt News
and elsewhere. has failed to em-
brace a genuinely pro-lit'e policy
by opposingthe death penalty and
the senseless mass violence and
deaths of war. one must regard
their argument as hypocritical.
And to the extent that thier
spokesmen have failed to discrim-
inate 'carefully in discussing
"life," one may regard their posi-
tion‘ on abortion as untenable.

There is no/doubt that the fer-
tilized ovum and fetus are alive.
There is also no doubt that they
are in some sense homo sapien.
that is the cellular material con-
tains the biological code which
distinguishes a member of our
species. These facts alone do not
entitle the fetus to special protec-
tion, unless we shall so distort
language as to suggest that every
surgical removal of a diseased ap-

‘penjdix i-s murder. Every cell of

 

‘munality of

 

the body is "human" to this de-
gree. each contains the genetic
code unique to the individual and
with every injury many of these
cells are killed.

A reyerent belief in the sancti-
ty of human life may properly be
urged as an uplifting and unifying
precept which distinguishes sensi-
tive men and humane societies.
There is nothing, however, in such
belief, elevated perhaps to a fun-
damental religious and ethical
principle, which conflicts with the
advocacy of abortion.a

The principle of the sanctity of
human life embodies respect and
tolerance toward the lives of
others. and thus, hopefully. in re-
ciprocity. toward ourselves. It

recognizes that life being precious-

to each of us. it is equally precious
to others. The first part of the
principle is basically selfish. to
protect each of us. conscious of
our own existence. from the pain-
ful fear of our own death at the
hands of others. There is a second
part which recognizes the com-
human existence.
which asserts that the death of
any of us impoverishes the whole
of humankind. Each individual is

‘a member of a constellation of

family and friends whom he loves
and a larger community he de-
pends upon. The death of these
people are likewise hurtful to us.
as our own death would be hurtful
to them.

These. however. are precisely
the attributes a fetus does not
possess. It is not a member of any
community, it is not conscious in
any normal sense of that word.
has no identifiable concept of self.
and is not humanly alive any more
than a man‘s gall bladder is. The
capacity for sensorial movement.
possessed by most lower forms of
life. can in no way be equated with
consciousness aware of itself.
The fetus is not an interacting
part of society, it is not loved or
loving, or depended upon. or part
of the lives of others, excepting
the couple who created it. The

fetus does not therefore qualify.

for the. special protection afford-
ed human individuals. and it is not
murder to_destroy it.

The decision as to when human
life begins will necessarily have
no precise answer, but this diffi-
culty cannot justify founding an
ethic upon a reductio ad absur-
dum. We might adopt quite arbi-
trarily the ‘time 10 days after
birth for a legal standard. By
that time, long before functioning
self-awareness, the infant begins
to acquire a certain status in the
lives of other humans. Before
then, as part of the life of the one
or two human beings who might
care for it, the decision of life
and death _resides with them
alone. Society has no overriding
right to meddle in the decision
(unless there might be some
danger of the perpetuation of the
species, a problem we do not face
owing to too few births).

The fetus, not a human being.
and not important to the commun-
ity. has no rights. The anti-abor-
tion laws, in fact, give the fetus
not therights of a human being.
but rights far in excess of human
rights, namely a right to the use
of another person's body against
her will. The fetus would be given
the right to make enormous de-
mands on another, perhaps weak-
ening, confining, and distressing
her. without her assent; and she
would deprived of any remedy. at
bar or otherwise. It is after all.
not for the sake of the principle
that we urge that sanctity of hu-
man life. but for the protection
and enrichment of human beings.

If. as the rally speakers sug-

gested. they fear abortion de-’

means human values and human
dignity. I reply that it truly de-

 

means human life to equate a
functioning. self-aware. loving.
and interacting human being to
the unformed. passive, incogitant
life that is the fetus.
Sincerely yours.

Tender Bosum
lmperiled

Dear Editor:

I have a niece attending your
school. I shall not reveal her name
for fear she will be scoffed at.
called‘Priscilla Prude and Vir-
ginia Virgin and other such ap-
pellations.

However, she is-one of the for-
tunate girls. She is immune to this
hideous age and its scarlet
values. Her long brown limbs and
tender bosom will not be des-
poiled bysome lusting loutout
fora cheap night’s adventure.

But what sort of age is this that
permits institutions of higher
learning to pass out birth control
pills willy nilly, that allows stu-
dents to cohabit without penalty?
How long can our debauched so-
ciety go on ignoring the mass dis-
tribution of films like Marjoe,
pocket books like The Story of O.
or more recently Dolinsky’s
Mind One. How long can obnox-
ious disc jockeys continue to play
recordings nationwide extolling
drugs and urging girls to “hang
the whole gang.” .

Young people, I ask you to
take a moment! Pause, reconsider
your peril. Save yourselves.<Turn
your backs on the licentiousness
around you.

And dear editor I ask you. please
print my letter. Allow one shaft
of sunlight to pierce the gloom of
"the stone zone.”

Sincerely.

You can get a whole weekend
worth of. reading and something
you haven’t seen lately—change
from a dollar. And it’s all within
easy reach of the campus.

The location——4612 Winthrop St.,
just off Craig and two blocks down
from Fifth.'The price range —
from very reasonable to ridicu-
lous. The place—a formeigprivate
home fitted out as a bookstore,
specifically, the Bryn Mawr-Vas-
sar book store. '

The name suggests that any
profits from this enterprise will
go ‘to a worthy cause; the prices
suggest that it’s a good thing the
student bodies of the two colleges

I are already well-endowed. They’ll

never get rich at this rate.

The store is open Monday.

through Thursday_ from‘ 10 am.
until 4 p.m., Wednesday evenings

— from 7 to .9, and Saturdays from

10 in the morning until 1'in theat-
ternoon. It is staffed by volunteers

 ‘L and the books for sale have been

donated, (Book donations would
be accepted, no doubt graciously.)

I     Mawr—Vassar Bookstore

  A Weekend’s Worth of Reading

Some days there is a box on the
front porch, containing about a
bushel of books, and decorated

with a sign inviting all and sundry 5

to “Take One.” Inside there are
four rooms where books are dis-
played, two upstairs and two
down, and a basement where
large sets and encyclopedias are
stored. A display case in the front
room shows sample volumes of
the sets. Another case holds rare
and valuable editions. Paperbacks
are in the back room, still on the
first floor. They generally cost
15¢, though oversized volumes
may be as much as 25¢.

Hardbacks are on shelves, on
every wall of every room. They
are sorted by general categories,
but not strictly catalogued. within
the categories. This encourages
browsing, as a particular work ‘of

. French Literature or’ Asian his-

tory, may be anywheremin its sec-
tion. Or it might not be there at
all, which adds a sporting touch.

Monday, December 4, 1972—THE PITT NE,WS+-Page‘: 5;

One of my favorite sections is
on the second floor, back room —
books in a wide variety of foreign
languages. It fils a need that
seems to have been abandoned by
the University Bookstore, which
used to stock a good selection of
contemporary and standard
works in French, German, Span-
ish, and Italian, as well as a few
examples of such arcane lan-
guages as Russian. Now it is dif-
ficult to find anything that is not
specifically assigned for a course.

No matter. The Bryn Mawr-
Vassar people have a shelf run-
ning from the floor to the high
ceiling stuffed with non-English

goodies. For example, Ifound a ’

copy of The Little Prince by Saint
Exupery (in French) for a dime.
An elderly but useful German-
Englishdictionary for a quarter.
There are a lot of textbooks in.
this section; at least a few of
them are in current use at local
colleges. ’

Until now. Jack Bruce had the
knack.of' being in the right place
at the right time. Bruce‘s sense
of timing was remarkably accu-
rate when he, Eric Clapton, and
Ginger Baker formed the highly
successful and brilliant Cream,
and his credibility was further
enhanced when they dissolved
before becoming excessively
big as did Led Zeplin and Cros-
by. Stills, Nash, and Young.

On his own, Bruce reasserted
his tendency musically. if ‘not
financially as he did with Cream,

Why Doncha essentially con-
sists of high-energized FOCK’ 'n‘
roll anid serves as a vehicle for
Leslie West to express his ego-
tism. West, Bruce. and dru nmer
Corky Laing. with engineer Andy
Jones are all accredited with pro-
ducing the album. but the coin-
cidence of Leslie West's name
being listed first and the pre-
dominance of his guitar through-
out the record suggests that he
probably had final decision as
the mixing. This was_ the icing

Degree,” “Pleasure,” and “Pol-
lution Woman,” the tracks on
which Jack Bruce's vocals are
represented, all share the com-
mon ingredients of an unclear,

-broken voice and muffled sounds
,of-...bass and keyboard, drowned

out by the volume of West’s
amplification. Bruce is one of
the few bassists in’ rock with
an identity all of his own, and
it’s a shame that his talent here
goes to such waste.

Also plaguing the album is a
shortage of lyrical contributions

By ANDREW J. sopxo

., A Art Editor
 The Pittsburgh Opera's new
production of Wagner's “Fly-

ing Dutchman” has now joined
the ranks of the Titanic, the Lusi-
tania, and /the Andrea Doria at
the bottom.

While we can hardly belittle

the problems’ inherent in Wag-.

nerian musical drams. it would
seem that our local company is
intent upon creating major fiascos
rather thancredible manifesta-
tions of the German master’s mu-

, sic. The relative rarity of Wagner-
\ ian musical drama in ‘our city’s
‘ operatic diet leaves inany a de-
voted Wagnerite hoping for the

, day when a convincing production
' "will be‘ an actual realit_\' in

. Pittsburgh.

Dutchman has proven that that
day is far off indeed.

Most of the evening’s prob-
lems spranggfrom Hermann Wede-
kind’s staging, "Henry Dahm’s

I
is‘-\.

g scenery, and Pat Simmons"light-A

ing. Each of these artists evident-
ly took into consideration ad infin-
itum the idea of “Dutchman” as a
V prime example of the northern
Kﬁﬁgothic tale, but their attempts

:in portraying the work as such’ .

£1 ‘succeeded only in making it
' I drab and depressing.

Lighting was absolutely ‘atro-.

cious throughout. Those ‘of us

V who sat in the gallery strained
our eyes in the hope that~we
might see what was happening
on stage.

In the darkness, the chorus
groped about the stage as if
lost in some labyrinth and even
.Santa‘s leap into the sea at the
conculsion of the work went al-
most unnoticed.

_ Despite this, the scenery still
l . deserves the “total disaster”
\ award. One needed a vivid imag-
' fsiiiation to envision a square,

“ ‘raised platform as the bow of
-"5" .Daland’s ship, ' especially after
the spectral ship of the Dutchman

arrived in port (a ship which was
never seen completely due to the
on-stage darkness, but which did
change color now and then to the
amusement of many of us).

Needless to say. there was some
good singing during the even-

ing. Walter Cassel was richly.

resonant as the Dutchman. In
addition, to sounding his part.
he looked it.

Claire Watson’s Senta was most
convincing. Her voice was fully
robust and she had no qualms
about slipping in and out of those
high Ds which pop up ‘during
act two. '

Unfortunately, however, the
other singers had their share of
problems during the evening.
Red Mac Wherter as Erik was
very booty’ in his approach to
vocalizing. Rather than ‘sing
with only his voice, he found it
necessary to throw his entire
body into the set. Paul Pleshka
as Daland and Julia Lerner as
Mary were unmoved and unmov-
ing for the greater part of their
performances. '

The members of the Pitts-
burgh Opera chorus are still

being paid. and we cannot really
imagine why. Tenors and basses
who portrayed Daland‘s crew
in the opening scene sounded as
if they had been imbibing rum
in the hold below; they refused
to sing together with any sense
of ensemble and several voices
stuck out blatantly. The women of
the chours fared no better dur-
ing their act two spinning scene.
Their approach was jumbled and
their German pronunciation
muddled. )

Fortunately for everyone in-
volved. the orchestra played mag‘
nificently. The overture was a
tour de force and the _h0FnP1P_e
of act three a delighttul experi-
ence. -

Quite frankly, this operatic ven-
ture bore breat resemblance to
the Dutchman’s spectral ship; it
was only a ghost of what it should
have been. Dr. Karp, we think
it best that you exercise this ghost
from your repertoire immediately

and reconsider future attempts .

years on. this production revers-
ing and rewriting it as he pon-
dered its philosophical theme.

“It maintains realism through
actually having Christ crucified

Christ portrayed as a black man
in order to communicate his abil-
ity to be identified with all
mankind regardless of color‘ or
creed.”

CHAPEL HILL, N. C. — Taking
advantage of a very healthy foul
situation and a 61 per cent shoot-

Tar Heels of North Carolina
trounced the Pitt Panthers last
Saturday afternoon at Carmichael
Auditorium. in front of 8.500 rav-

It's about 300 miles to Ann.Ar-

bor. but the trip home must have

seemed like a thousand to\Pitt's
wrestling team following their
lopsided 32-2 thrashing at the . 
uh . . . hands of the University of
Michigan this past Saturday. In
the first dual action for each club.
the powerful Big Ten title aspir-
ant got off quickly with Jim Brown
trounching Pitt’s ' 118 pound
Bryant by a score of 12-2, and roll-
ing up similar scores on the Pan-
ther’s lessexperien ed matmen.

The Wolverines proceeded to a
nearly clean sweep. and only a 9-5
point decision by Wally Morrell in
the 167 pound class saved Pitt
from a shutout.

Coach Dave Adams was quite
explicit in his disappointment.
"We just smelled the place out."
he said. "We were completely flat
and they were sky high."

The Panthers, minus an ailing
John Chatman, floundered, not be-
cause they weren’t physically

-Qfieady, but because they weren’t

mentally ready, Adams said.

It wasn't a case of the younger
wrestlers-Freshmen Bob Baily
and Brad Strayer and Sophomore

Bob Beck——suffering from open-.

ing day jitters. but rather an over-
all failure. “We just didn't react.“
Adams said. “We can’t blame it
on the younger wrestlers. we all
acted like spectators.“

Of course, Michigan were no
bunch of chumps. either. The
Wolverines 158 pounder is Mitch
Mendrygal, last seasons Bib Ten
champ at that weight.‘ It was
Mendrygal who scored. the only
fall of the day when he pinned

the points.

Because the Cats decided/ to
play a close inside game and be-
cause the officials -— particularly
James Wadell of the ACC — were
toot happy, the Cats were victims
of serious foul trouble.

However. they managed to stay
within 1-2 at thehalf. thanks to
some nifty play by Bill Sulkowski
and Bill Knight. ’

But. disaster struck in the sec-
ond half. Three fouls were called

_, against the Panthers in the first

minute of the second half. The
game got completely out of hand—
59 fouls were called altogether.
only 18 against the North Caro-
linans. Down by 12 at the 10 min-
ute mark. the Carolina natives rat-
tled off 13-straight points at one
stretch. all from the foul line. Al-
ready possessing a 12 point lead.
the spurt ended the Cats day.

Bill Knight, though not as sharp
as in the past, bagged 25 points
and pulled down seven rebounds.

Before the game NC coach Dean
Smith said he expected a tough
game.

"There a lot of question marks
about both teams. We are botll
relatively young. We lost seven of

"our top 10 players from last year.

but I expect to win because we are
playing at home," he said. in a
way only a Southerner could.

' The handful of Pittsburghers
who made the trip as the Rebound-
ers (the booster club)'were to find

Trounses

Evans, who was subbing for John
Chapman, at 7:20 of the match.

Oh yeah, they another guy, Jer-
ry Hubbard, at 150 pounds who
was no slouch, as Pitt’s
John Buzzato will attest. Besides
earning a 9-1 decision over Buzza-
to, Hubbard has the distinction of
being not only Big Ten champ, but
runner up in the NCAA tourney
last year.

Michigan is a tough opener for
any team. and the Cats took their
lumps, but they‘ll be back. "These
kids are embarrassed; they know
how bad they looked. Our guys
will bounce back," Adams said.

In fact. Adams himself took a
chunk of the blame. assuming the
responsibility of having his team
“overact to Michigan's reputa-
tion.”

But when they get whipped you
can’t moan, and the Panthers
must look forward to next Satur-
day’s match with rival Eastern

.power Temple at the Field House.

The Owls will be the first and last
home opponents for the Cats un-
til Jan. 6,” when Navy’s Midship-
men bring a powerful squad to
town.

At the Temple match on Dec. 9.
something newga wrestling boost-
ers club will be unveiled. The
Golden Grapplers. as they are
called, are sponsoring a High
School Wrestling Day. The Grap-
plers hope to attract a substantial
number of school boy prospects
as well as any interested mat fans
who will. hopefully. view a much
more impressive Panther perfor-
mance. Dave Adams is hoping too.
"I sure hope we are better than
we were against Michigan."

C-MU

by BART MACK

Goals could have been a dime a
dozen last night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet, but the Pitt Hockey Club
just couldn't get one when they
needed it, as the skaters went
down at the hands oc Carnegie-
mellon University by a 4-3 score.
It was the first time in 15 games
that the skaters lost to a Western

Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Asso-.

. J
clatlon opponent.

The Alpine Arena packed with
C-MU supporters. the Tartans
gave them reason to cheer. taking
a 1-0 first period lead. C-MU came
out strong from the opening face-
off. testing Mark Liberman early
in the going. Lieberman came up
with three excellent saves in the
opening» minutes to stop C-MU
from grabbing an early lead.

The initial Tartan score came
on the power play. a situation that
Pitt was in several times through-
out the night. C-MU goalie Jeff
Hart was also hot. coming up with
a solid performance. especially in
the third period-l H-art stopped
Dave Bahnson on a breakaway in
the first period as the puck rolled
off Bahnsons stick into his pads.‘

Smith saw it differently.

“If they had called all the fouls
I saw, we’d still be playing in the
first half,” he commented.

-Despite the 21 point edge at the

charity line, the North Carolina
offense cannot be deprived. They
would not miss and looked like
last year's team with their shoot-
ing. The Cats downfall was due to
their 45 per cent shooting aver-
age.

Women Want Sports Recognition

by VICKY VETERE
"We want to get recognized. We

I want to be heard." This is the slo-

gan of the newly established Wom-
en's Varsity Sports Board.

' The purpose of the Board is to
coordinate the five women’s var-
sity sports - volleyball. swim-
ming, basketball, gymnastics. and
tennis. Each team has two repre-
sentatives on the Board and ineet-
ings are held with the respective
coaches plus members of the Ath-
letic Department.

The Board has set up four com-,

mittees. One is to handle publicity
for women’s sports. The function
of the second committee is to es-
tablish a set of varsity standards
to lend coherence to the whole
women‘s varsity sports program.
‘The’ third is a banquet commit-

 ‘tee whose purpose is to plan an
Athletic Reception at the end of

the year in recognition of women

athletes. The final committee has

the job of attempting to get two

‘graduate assistants who will work

on a full-time basis to recruit

"women into the sports program

and will also handle some of the
publicity.

A meeting of the Board was held
last Friday at Rees Hall. Donna
l)eMarino. captain of the gymnas-
tics team, and Ann Walliscli of
the swimming team officiated.
Both long range objectives and
more immediate goals were dis-
cussed.

For next year, a ‘full scale re-
cruitment program is in the inak-
ing. “Each team willhold their
own reception so that high school
girls and their parents can come
and meet the girls on the teams."
said Wallisch.

The Board hopes to eventually
publish a brochure on the wom-
en’s arsity sports program at
Pitt to better acquaint incoming
students with the athletic facil-
ities available and their opportun-
ities to join a varsity team.

In addition to discussing their
plans, the women also aired some
problems at the meeting. Wall-
isch explained that “The men's
and women's sports programs
here at Pitt are two seperate en-

tities. It’s only in theory that
were united. The men just don't
have time for the women in ath-
letics. We need to make ourselves
heard. We want to be recognized
by the Chancellor at the end of the
year and receive awards just as
the men do."

Sue Anderson of the wo.nen's
basketball team cited another
problem. “At practices we've had
a turnout of only 16 girls so far.
That’s really a disappointing num—‘
ber considering the size of the
University. Girls dont realize

that you don't have to be a great

experience player to get on the
team. In fact. most of the girls on
our varsity teams are not even
education majors.
They’re just interested in a sport
and enjoy playing it.“

In view of the tight athletic bud-
get the women in particular know
they are up against a money prob-
lem. However, their primary con-
cern right now is to organize the

women’s varsity sports program

and make the Board's existence
known.

The women athletes here at Pitt
are enthusiastic and spend many
long hours in training. It is time
they gained for themselves the
recognition they all deserve.

Women Spikers
Finish On Top

Pitt‘s womens varsity volleyball team ended its season Saturday
on a winning note as they beat Youngstown University by hard-fought
scores of 15-4. 12-15. and 15-5.

-Tlie junior varisyt team also took the win in an equally tought
struggle with scores of 15-12, 15-17, and 15-9.

After having lost badly to Indiana University last Wednesday the ‘

women were determined to tilt their 4-4 record toward the winning
side, and indeed they did on Saturday to officially close the season at
5-4. 4

Manager Eileen Surdoval admitted, “Youngstown is a good team.
It was a struggle, but we -made. Helen Baginski and Fickie Bundy made
a good combination. With Vickie’s setting and HeIen’s spiking we scor-
ed a good amount of points. Cathy Cassell also hit her share of spikes.”

Looking back over the season, the women got off to a fine start
beating Kent State and Chatham. A slight set-back came at the hands
of powerful Slippery Rock, but the spikers came right back with two
more wins as they downed Edinboro and CMU.

with over half the schedule complete theyr record was an optim-
istic 4-1. But the remaining four games proved to be the toughest as
the women lost three straight to Ohio State. Capital. and Indiana to
things out at a disappointing 4-4. Then came the final effort against
Youngstown to yield a 5-4 season result.

The last win was more of symbolic value. To be able to look back
on a winning season is more of an inspiration to next year's squad.
Even though the recordidoes not show a fantastic season victory it
points to one very important fact. A squad of women playing power vol-
leyball for the first time took on some pretty rough competition and
still came outahead. _

Next Coach-P Rumor Is.....

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor‘

You name him and he's coming
to Pitt to lift the Panther football
program out of losing ways.

It has been exactly one week
since Pitt's Athletic Director Cas-
imir Myslinski fired head football
coach Carl DePasqua and in that
t1mes’a great many rumors have
been spreading about many pos-
sible replacements for him.

Names on the list of replace-
ments is impressive to say the
least —— Johnny Majors. Frank
Kush, Duffy Daugherty, Johnny
Unitas, Bart Starr. Some over-
zealous sources have even eluded
such names as Joe Paterno and
Art Parseghian as noteworthy
possibilities.

It is almost certain that neither
Paterno T nor Parseghian would
leave their respective paradises
at Penn State and Notre Dame for
any price that Pitt would be will-
ing to pay.

The other coaches cited may
sound a bit outrageous at first but
when speaking in terms of Pan-
ther football you have to keep a

Kush. Arizona State's mentor.
quickly squelched the rumors
about his transfer to Pittsburgh.
No sooner were the stories
spreading than he was quickly
denying the validity of any of
them.

Having been offered the same
job with the Panthers four years
ago, Kush explained, “I’m pretty
well entrenched now (in the Tem-
pe, Ariz., area). My family real-
ly enjoys it here. That was one of

' the hangups before."

Kush contends that the Arizona
State team that he manned to a
Western Conference champion-
ship and Fiesta Bowl bid this year

is his ‘main concern at this point‘

and that he isn't likely to change
his mind.

Iowa States coach. Majors. is
also just thinking in terms of his
own team at present and doesn't
seem anxious to do otherwise.

Last week Majors related that

he had “a game Saturday, and a
bowl game coming up” and that
he didn't feel free to comment on
the situation at the time.

Unitas and Starr are the names
that have been pulled from the
ranks of the professional football
players.

"Both of these outstanding quar-
terbacks (Unitas for the Balti-
more Colts and Starr for the
Green Bay Packers) seem to
have had their fi ll of professional
football and may be looking for
something different. Coaching the
Panthers would surely fill that
bill. .

Of the two, Unitas seems to stir
the most enthusiasm, possibly be-
cause of his Pittsburghearea ori-
gin. Besides, what college quar-
berback wouldn’t want to be
coached by someone like Unitas-
the interest of the nations top col-
legiate quarterbacks in this pos-
sible situation at Pitt is manna
