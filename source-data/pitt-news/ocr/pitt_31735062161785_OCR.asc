FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1949

Three weeks ago_he estimated

that the fall enrollment would show‘ ’

a slight drop, a seven per cent one»
with the total’ "approximately
19,000.”

By his tentative figures, which
carry through Sept. 30, he missed
his guess by just nine students.
It is 19,009.

Dr. Quick did say, though, that
't_hega_1p between last fall’s final
ﬁgures 20,420 combined day and
afternoon, evening, and Saturday
students, would likely be narrowed
by late returns.

The freshman statistics most
significantly account for the dip.

Close" to one-fifth less freshmen
entered Pitt this fall compared to
last Scbtember when 1549 enrolled.
The tentative 1949 figure stands
at 1279, a 17 per cent drop.

Vet Attendance Drops

A bulk of the decrease came,
Dr. Quiok’s report shows, in the
new veteran entrance group, where
a 9.5 percentage slip appears. This
lowers the veteran ‘proportion among
the incoming frosh to 20 per cent.

One exception to the downward
trend was noted. Part-time students,
the majority of whom study either
in the School of Education or as
non-degree students, are definitely
on an increase. 4

Their 20.5 and 10.2 per cent
boosts, along with raises in the
dental and medical: undergraduate
classes, :mark,the only plus figures
on the registration report.

Greater Drop Expected

Dr. Quick had feared a «greater

sag in the freshman class.
' "During the summer the figures
on freshman admissions were pre-
dictive of a much greater decrease
in the new first year glass,” he
‘said. “This was changed consid-
erably by eleventh hour cases,” he
explained.

Between Sept. 9 and 28, new
freshman applications totaled 144,
2.60 acceptances were made, and
335, better than a fourth of the
paid their
matriculation fees.

While the days of record—breaking
enrollments have passed, the reg-
istrar’s office did establish two
new marks in the actual registra-
tion procedure. This was attribut-
able to the sharpening of the pre-
registration process.

lsﬁegistration Quicker

On Saturday, the half-day that
opened the fall registration, 2330
students completed the procedure,
a new standard for fall registra-
tions. Likewise, on Monday 4173
passed through Syria Mosque,‘ ex-
ceeding any previous full-day fig-
ure.

the parking lot was illegal and a

told the court, "I have had no sleep

“Resigning” Rut

After watching, with little seriousness and considerable skep-
ticism, the operation of student government at Pitt for several
1 years, we find one unusual. trait defining the Panther politician
from the rest of the breed.

' Contrary to the standard type of legislator, the Pitt politico

- seems to do mor.e resigning than vote-seeking. The run-of-the-mill

politician is almost always working feverishly toward getting into
‘office or protecting his position while holding an office. Not at
“ ':P itt. _Our Bob Tafts and Sam Rayburns make the news oftener by
_fgﬁ7iHg‘up posts they ’.ve been elected to.

It has taken only five i'ssues of the News to record two legi-
slative resignations this semester and we understand there may
be, more coming. Last year the paper carried story after story as
‘ congressmen gave up posts. A

1 From the explanations offered, nine of ten resignees discover
they have bitten off more than theycan chew, offering apologies
ithat—“this or that position or pressing schoolwork forces me to
resign.”

While some might commend these men and women for giving
ﬁup positions they were duly elected or appointed to rather than
riding‘ along and doing nothing, we feel they should ‘have had
enough foresight to keep themselves out of the running from the
start. If they had, they would save the trouble of special elec-
tions and/or appointments and would not be denying another per— g
, sonthe original crack at the iob. I
I This string of strategic retreats also points up some clever
politicking by the more shrewd of the Pitt office-holders.

Ray Maher’s withdrawl from Men’s Council last week serves
as the most recent and perhaps the clearest illustration of it.

Maher, who along with the presidency of Inter-fraternity Coun-
-cil, held offices on both Student Congress and Men's Council
. until last week, when he dropped the latter post. _Internally re-
elected by Council last year, Maher, none the less, ran for and
won a Congress berth.

With both posts on his hands, Maher could choose the one
more to his liking and open the other to IF-dominated Council’s
1 ‘internal election, which will doubtless mean the hand-picking of
i a fraternity man who didn’t have the ballot box appeal of the pre-
sent members. ’

It iswith the constitutional flaws that permit dual offic-hold-
I lng thatwe quarrel, although we are not presumptuous enough to
assume that the closing of this hole would in any way affect”
, .IF’s strangleholds on the two houses. It makes a farce, though,
of-the elections.

. However, we do believe that this and the control monopoly
I is unfair to the budding politicians who are denied the chance to
practice their intended profession merely because they haven’t
the opportunity or the money to “register IF.” ‘

A recent issue of the Pitt News
carried an item under your name
concerning smoking in which you

respondent who obj.ects to the in-
discriminate use of tobaccos. She
is to be commended for her efforts
and_I should like to have her name.‘

You refer lightly to her writing.
on the subject, yet you write on the
subject. Your attitude is that of the;
usual tobacco user -- “to hell with
others if I want to smoke,” a
strange attitude for a person who
probably considers himself well»
mannered, well-bred and intelligent.
You are in the position of most
writers -- they write without being
informed on the subject about which

they write. Suppose you adequately
inform yourself on the subject of
the use of tobacco -— you may find
that the young lady has a case. At
any rate, a writer in any publica-
tion should not so tactlessly and
contemptuously ridicule the opin-
ions of others. .

By the way of comment, "I am not
a student but the father of a -stu-

ED NOTE--It is not our policy
to ridicule‘ or “refer lightly” to
our letter writers. We do, as the
paragraph above Mr. Boss’s‘epistle
states, welcome reader comment.
However, when a reader like our
Carrie Nation (News, Sept. 27)
continually floods us with propa-

ganda we obviously reject, she

opens herself, as does any cru-
sader, to the legitimate attack of
the press.

We repeat, “Cigarettes are here
to stay.” Her campaign is simply
‘one of batting her head against a
stone wall.

Voting on

Vacancies

Men’s Council last Tuesday
tabled the election of a College
junior to replace Ray Maher, who
resigned last week, until their next
meeting, scheduled for Tuesday,
Oct. 18.

A college senior will also be
el‘e‘Cte‘d then to replace Bob Kauff
man, who resigned from Men’s Coun-
cil Tuesday.

In a letter to Howard Greenberger,
president of Council, Kauffman
stated that due to his activities as
basketball manager, he would be
unable to continue as a member of
Men’s Council. He praised Coun-
cil’s "rise in prestige” during the
three Years that he was a member.

President Greenberger accepted
the resignation with “deep regret.”

Council decided to table the
College junior election originally
scheduled for this weel<'until the
tally sheets of last Spring’s elec-
tion could be secured and studied.
The election will be open to any
College junior. Council, however,
hopes to consider those who se-
cured a high vote at the last elec-
tion and the two alternates who
were nominated by the Nominating
Committee last spring.

At that time it was believed that
two members of Men’s Council
would resign from Council to accept
positions on Student Congress. This
was not the case, however, and the
two alternates therefore did not be-
come Council members.

Panther
Sales Soars

The “Curr” edition of the Pan-
ther was a sell-out. Business man-
ager Ralph Douglas estimated that
3,000 copies were distributed on
Wednesday.

, This sale compares favorable
with those of 1949-50 issues.

This year a contest was run with
individuals and campus organiza-
tions competing to sell the most,
copies. Winners of the 325 Award
and gold loving cup have not yet
been determined.

Plans for future issues of the
magazine are being laid now. The
“Campus Candids” picture series,
which was the Subject Of P0131113-f
comment last year, is to be resumed
in the next edition.

that, under the present operational

Unpredictable Mounties
Aimfor Upset Victory

BY JOHN MEGELLA
In taking to the hills this weekend to tangle with West Virginia, Mike
Mi1ligan’s Panthers are reckoned to add to Dr. Dudley DeGroot’s oolog-

ical collection.

eggs, can look for the goose eggs
after the Pitt-Mountaineer game.
The Panthers are expected to do-
nate four of this variety to Dud
and the Mounties Saturday, one for
each quarter of the game.

West Virginia, an in-and—out
team this season, has been operat-
ing on an "it’s-fun-to-be-fooled"
basis. After winning the opener
from Waynesburg, 42-7, the
Mounties were upset by Ohio Uni-
versity, 17-7, the following week.
Rated underdogs against Washing-
ton and Lee, the West Virginians
fooled the experts again by defeat-
ing the Generals, 28-20.

Surprises Sprung

In the W&L ame, DeGroot, who
has plenty on the ball as football
coach as well as an ornithologist,
showed just how unpredictablehe
and the Mountaineers can be.

Groot started his reserves against

Coach DeGroot, one of the nation’s authorities on the study of bird’sf

 

tion team, the reserves ran from
the single wing and scored 14
points before halftime when Dud
substituted his T eleven.
Two Platoons

The Mounties, who use the two
platoon system extensively, boast
of a wide open style of play. In
releases from Morgantown it is
described as "the Dud DeGroot T
formation with new features.”

From all indications, the only
reliable thing about the West Vir-
ginis team is the fullback position.
In this spot Capt. Pete (Old Re-
liable) Ziniach stands out.

Rounding out the backfield are
halfbacks John Murphy and Ray
Caldwell and Quarterback ]im«Walt-
hall,’ the number four passer in the
nation last year. Walthall, who
completed 89 passes out of 178

1948, was picked on Collier’s All-
Eastern eleven. '

Looking Sharp

By wmon xopstum
Sports Editor

 

A coach is always happy to have a couple of 60-minute men
around, but he is seldom happy when he has to use them that long.
Nowadays, teams known for their iron men are teams known for
their tin bench warmers. .C1Yd<_?_ Smith’s Indiana club was called

"Smith’s Iron Men” last year. His
team ofcourse,won few ball games.

iTherein lies the reason Why
Mike Milligan’s Panthers should go
places this season. The happiest
point proved by the Northwestern
game was that Pitt has strength,
from the left end of the bench to
the right end.

Moreover, it is not just promis-
ing sophomores who have suddenly
taken leading roles. End Bill Samer
and Guard Don Karanovich, who
have been picking up splinters for
two years now, got into the North-
western tilt and threw everything
but their old home, the bench, at
the Wildcats.

‘Depth provided by the sopho-

,mores is not only good news for
the moment but insurance for future
years. The Campbells, Andabakers,
Sichkos, Gasparovics, and other
sophs will be the regulars a year
or two hence.

But it is even more encouraging
to see the veteran scrubs, who
have been plugging away for a long «

The hunch is prevalent that be-
fore the season is too old, there
will be more unknowns — men who
have heretofore made a sideline
seat their permanent residence —
stealing pieces of headline.

_ Some Workout!

Reader Marvin Sheffler clipped
the following Pulitzer Prize piece
from a Chicago newspaper on the

I day of the Northwestern game.
“The Panthers have a stout running
game...that should give the Wild-
cats good practice for their clutch
game with Minnesota a week

 

hence.” Northwestern should be
well practiced by now, eh?

Graduate Manager Frank Carver
argued before the .start of the sea-
son that Pitt would win five of
its first six games. He now includes
all six, and understandably so.

With William & Mary and North-
western out of the way, the next
four include West Virginia, Miami
of Ohio, Indiana, and Penn. Natur-
ally, Ohio State, Minnesota, and
Penn State are not only too tough
but too far in the future to specu-
late on. »

No Overconfidence

Don’t look for overconfidence to
spoil the Panthers at Morgantown
tomorrow. Judging from their con-
versation on the way home from
Evanston last week,Northwestern’s
goats have taught them a lesson.

The United Press story mention-
ing five Panthers for All-America
consideration means exactly noth-
ing. I don’t want to take credit
away from Nick DeRosa, Bernie
Barkouskie, Nick Bolkovac, Bimbo
Cecconi, or Jimmy Joe Robinson.
But the wire services mention
everybody and his brother, so news-
papers in as many localities as
possible will buy the story.

Pitt Harriers I

 Meet Rockets

Cross coun.try’enters the Pitt
sports scene today when Carl Ol-
son’s harriers start the season by
meeting an old menace in Slippery
Rock at Flagstaff Hill, Schenley
Park, at 4 p.m.

feated Geneva in their season open-

last season. Virtually the
same squad that defeated Pitt is

Four sophomores have moved into

competes today. Ken-Mahanna, a
comparatively unknown from W_ash-
ington High, outdistanced the flock
inthe tryouts last Friday while first
year men, Jack McMahon and Ed
Berman, were clocked second and
third, respectively.

Lone veteran to gain a place Fri-
day was 1948’_s top point getter Ted
Zatkovich. he notched fourth spot.

Additional tryouts were held Tues-
and seventh
places were determined. Frank Ku-
zm'a, who missed the initial trials
Friday, paced the remaining Can:
didates to clinch the number five
spot. Two varsity members, John
Weigel and Jay Neilson, gained the
remaining berths.

The remainder of the squad will
also compete in today’s meet but
only the above mentioned seven
starters will be scored.

7-6 Win

  Dezen Pass

Gives Eps

An unimpressive Phi Ep six
sneaked by Theta Chi this week by
the narrow sc_:_ore;of 7-5, Theta Chi,
tossed a scare into the Phi Eps as
they threatened with alate drive
which fizzled out on the one-foot
mark.

After receiving a Theta Chi punt
the Phi Eps marched 60 yards to a
touchdown when Howard Dezen, Phi
Ep star, took a lateral from Curly
Weitz and flipped the six-pointer to
Mark Chernoff. Dezen’s pass for
the extra point was good to center
Gurson Green.

Theta Chi scored on the last
play of the first half on a long
pass. Joe Cruciani heaved a 40-
yard aerial which Jack Doyle
speared out of the arms of twp Phi
Ep defenders for a touchdown.
Cruciani’s pass attempt for the
extra point bounded out of the arms
of its intended receiver. A

Victory eluded Theta Chi on two
occasions in the dying moments of
the contest. After making a first
down on the Phi Ep 5, their attack
sputtered.

With the Phi Eps taking over,
halfback Dezen, on a deep reverse,
was trapped in the end zone for
what would have been. the winning
two points, but he skipped to the

' goal line before he was stopped.

DTD Swamp KNs

The weather proved more of a
menace to a Delta Tau Uelta vic-
tory than did the Kappa Nu grid-
ders. Dark rain clouds hovered
overhead threatening to wash out
an easy 41-0 Delt win.

Ken Thorpe was the whole show
‘for the Delts. He scored three
touchdowns and passed for one.
Bill Brehm, Dick Ruth, and_ Ralph
Douglas also figured in the Delt-
scoring.

SAE, Delta Sig Tie

With 35 seconds of playing time
_remaining, SAE managed to knot
‘its game with Delta Sigma Phi at
7-7. A 20-yard pass from Bob Moul-
ton to Bob Miller scored for SAE.

The all, important extra point
was made on a pass from Miller to
Phil Sweet.

Jim Smyers passed to Dick
Littleman for Delta Sig’s score in
the third quarter. Blaine Helmar
notched the extra point on a pass
. from Smyers.

Sammies Bow

In the other game‘ played at the
Oval the Sammies were no match
for the powerful Phi Delts, bowing
1'09-0.

Larry Brent passed to Butch
Stoffer and Joe Perkovich for two
markers, while Bob Badke "recov-
ered a Phi.De1t kickoff in the Sam-
mie’s end zone for the third touch-
down."

Brent passed to Stoffer for the
extra point.

million unknown diabetics.

Health to test only the faculty.
Through the added help of Doc
Carlson, however, all male students
may avail themselves of the free
test. The News has as yet received
no word from the Women’s Health
Service as to whether the test will
be available to female students.

Tests Next Week

Interested males should report to
the 34th floor any day next week
between 0 a.m. and 47p.m. for urin-
alysis tests. I

The advantages for people afflic-
ted with diabetes discovering it at ’
an early age is that it can be treat-
ed by insulin and very often, in the
case of overweight persons, can be
completely cured through dietetic
methods. .

Next week's screening test will

. determine whether or not the stu-

dent's urine has a positive sugar
content. In such cases, they will be
referred to their private physician.
Positive indications of sugar
does not necessarily mean that a
student is a diabetic. All diabet-
ics, however, havea sugar content.

Early Treatment Helpful

Confirmed diabetics,-because of
modern scientific discoveries, are
not gravely endangered, but_ are
subject" to constant states of leth-
argy. Early treatment can very often
prevent this.

great success.
The idea was hatched by Dean of

his lieutenants Charles H. Ebert
Jr. and Edward J. McIntosh. These
TV pioneers secured a set from the
J. E. Miller Co. of Pittsburgh. It
was dispatched poste-haste tothe
University. -
Originally TV was set to rear its

to repose in front of the office of

There, with a network of aerial
wires effectively hemming in all oc-

the first Pitt television" show
flickered on.

Minute byminute the crowd grew
until passage in or out of the News,

Pitt Varsity Band Soothes

“Upset” Wildcat

By MILO PONTE -

The music of Robert L. Arthur’s
Varsity Marching Band had charms
to soothe the "upset” Northwestern
fans Saturday.

For almost an hour after the
game, thousands of Illinois rootersi
remained in the stadium cheering
for "More, more!” of that Pitt band.

A highlight of the post-contest
serenade .was the impromptu per-
formance of ‘a very young but very
charming majorette who addedher
flashy baton-twirling to the band’s
entertainment. The girl had appear-‘
ed with a Boy Scout drum and bugle
corps which shared the half-time
spotlight. ‘

' The fine ovation, beginning im-
mediately as the band made its
entrance and prolonged until long
after game time, was particularly
gratifying to Mr. Arthur, band direc-
tor. The Northwestern fans may be
considered good judges since they
are accustomed to the splendid
musical organizations of the Big
Ten Conference.

With enthusiasm at a high pitch,
and a successful football team for
competition, Mr. Arthur and his
assistant director, Ben Benack are
planning more novel half-time fea-
tures. _'

One novelty Mr. Benack is work-
ing on is an arrangement of “The
Toy Trumpet,” a Raymond Scott
original. Mr. Benack is well ac-
'qu_ainte.,d: with Scott’s music having
played with that orchestra the sum-
mer of 1947 on atour to California,
and he had a chance to visit with
his old bos-s the night before the

ST°“Es .EvERYH/1,‘.
"e

Rooters

game. Mr. Benack and several
bandsmen stopped in at the Blue
Note, a popular Chicago night spot,
Friday where Scott is playing.

Mr. Benack told Scott of his plan
to feature the "Toy Trumpet” and
promptly responded by demonstrat-
ing the way his tune should be
played. Then he asked the band
«members to gather around the band-
stand while he honored them with

This and other books used at Pitt
include "Liberalism and Social Ac-
tion,” "Philosophy and Civiliza-
tion,” and "The Public and Its
Problems.”V

All members of the faculty are
invited to attend the luncheon,
which will be presided over by
Samuel P. Franklin, Dean -of the
.School of Education.

The sponsors regret that the lack
of space prevents their inviting stu-
dents to the discussion.
