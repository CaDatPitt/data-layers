More money from fewer alums

G bok°

 

Students don’t only give
their hard-earned cash to Pitt
while paying ‘their tuition. Pitt
hits them up for cash again after
they graduate.

Although, lately, fewer
alumni have have heeded the
call.

“While alumni dollars have
gone up,
alumni donors
have, interest-
ingly, gone
down, which
means that . . ’
those people . I
who are giving to Pitt are giving
more,” said Peg Duronio, direc-
tor of planning and administra-
tion within the Office of
Institutional Advancement.

According to a 1995 survey
done by Pitt Telemarketing,
many alumni make donations
for tax deductions, desire to give
something back to their alma

 

mater, and positive feelings
about their collegiate experi-
ences.

However, 80 percent of
gifts in general, according to
Albert Melfo, director of tele-
marketing, come from only 20
percent of the alumni popula-
tion. .
According to Melfo, the
purpose of telemarketing at Pitt
is to renewformer donors and to

create new
donors. But
the students
working the
’ phones are
frustrated at
the large num-
ber of alumni who won’t give.

“We bring in the lion’s
share of new donors,” said
Melfo, “In telemarketing it is not

i only cost effective to call the

alumni, but it is also a more per-
sonal approach that many alum-
ni respond to.”

Many universities use tele-
marketing to get donations

because it is extremely cost eﬂi-
cient and has a relatively high
success rate.

But Pitt telemarketers said
they don’t get many positive
results.

“I get the regular ‘I hate
telemarketing’ people and the
immediate hang-ups,” said tele-
marketer Fred Sinkevich, a, Pitt
junior, “But sometimes I get
some very nice alumni who’ve
got great stories to tell and they
give, like, $300. But, a lot of
times, they make you work for
it.”

Many times, alumni won’t
make donations because they’re
still concerned with ﬁnancial
problems Pitt had in the past,
and this affects their decisions
about whether or not to con-
tribute.

“A large percentage of
alumni have an interest in Pitt,”
said Tom Strickler, a senior at
‘Pitt who has worked for two
years in Pitt Telemarketing. “But

SGB announces Pitt television station

Live broadcasts, weather,
sports, soap operas, talk shows,
all from atop the television hill 
at Pitt?

This could all be a part of
PlTT—TV’s future. Starting in the
fall of the ‘97 school year, the
University of Pittsburgh will gain
a television channel. It’s set to
premiere as an information list-
ing charmel, but entertainment
programing may follow soon. '

In a meeting of various
University organizations, Pitt
agreed to co—sponsor the
infocharmel in cooperation with
the Student Government Board.

“I think the infochannel is a
foundation for something much
greater,” said SGB member
Cyrus Zolghadri, mastermind of
the program. “It could be a fully
operational TV station where
students can conduct broadcasts
on everything from athletics to

special events.”

The channel will serve the
students by providing inforrna—
tion about campus activities, ath-
letics, news, registration and

other important service or com-
munity armouncements.

The Pitt infocharmel will be
free for all students in the resi-

BAS lakes fashion from
Ihe pusl into the future

..!"‘°"x§r"i*h

 

Opening with a setting in the 1940s
and ending with a look at fashion in the
21st .century, the Black Action
Society’s annual fashion show took an
audience of nearly 300 on a historical
spin ‘through black life Friday night,
filling the evening with a lot of body, a
lot of clothes, and a lot of soul.

The program, titled “The Essence
of Fashion with a Little Body and
Soul” opened in a juke joint during the
1940s. The scene came complete with
a grand piano, piano player in tuxedo,
and model Sala James as Billie
Holiday in a white sequined dress stun-
ningly finished with a boa ﬂaring at
both the top and bottom.

I Holiday’s song “Sister” resounded
throughout the room as the enthusiastic
audience boldly" joined in for the
refrain.

Performers strutted the stage,
demonstrating. the various styles of
clothing from the past five decades set
against a backdrop of politics and cul-
ture. ’

In an artful mix of V sights and
sounds, the audience witnessed the rise

_. of “black movie actors like Harry

Bellefonte; the importance of the
church; Martin Luther King, Jr.; stu-

dent sit—ins and protests, soul train’

dancers, break dancers, and current
campus life.,. i

The period clothing -— big wigs,
go—go boots, powder—blue pantsuits,
elegant evening wear, action—adventure
outerwear, and accessories —— were
made possible by various stores in

Oakland, Shadyside, Monroeville, and
Downtown.

Two African—American clothing
lines, the Pittsburgh—based “ofaafo”
and the Ohio-based “Ubnoxus,” were
also on hand, displaying their clothes
and donating some of them as prizes
for the audience during intermission.

It all ended with a grand finale that
rocketed the audience into the 21st

century on a journey into “the '

unknown.” The hypothetical scenario
presented both male and female mod-
els whose bodies were wrapped in
pink, purple, green, and yellow design-
er cellophane.

These outfits of the future were the
least expensive of the show, compli-
ments of Reynolds Plastic Wrap and
ringing up at only $3 each. Quite a bar-
gain, considering most of the show’s
formalwear ranged in price from $500
to well over $1200. .

Mykola Webster, coordinator of
the show, liked the 21st century attire
the best. She says that fashion, is
becoming increasingly bold and ‘open-
minded and that we just might end up
wearing a material like cellophane
someday.

Chandra Simpson, assistant coor-
dinator, described the event as more
than just a fashion show. “This is a
show about fashion, interspersed with
historical lessons designed to increase
awareness of our heritage,” she said.

The BAS fashion show has its own
heritage, too. It has been an annual
event for over 20 years. Auditions for
the show usually begin in September.
This year, over 100 people auditioned.

Only 22 were selected as models. '

Dowd

kind of person he was,” ‘said Claycarnp.
“He kept in close Contact with them
because he knew if something happened
to him, they would then be able to finish
their graduate degrees and do well.”

She said this as typical of Dowd, who
always put the education of his students as
his top priority. I

“He really was very protective of his
students,” Claycarnp said. “It’s easy when
one’s health is failing to think only about
yourself, but up until the very end,
Professor Dowd was thinking of his stu-
dents.” A

Professor George Wilcox’s ‘office

_neighbored Dowd’s, and Wilcox said
Dowd was highly respected and admired
by everyone in the department.

“He was a good friend to everybody,”
said Wilcox. “[He] set a good, wonderful
example for everyone, a real ‘scientist’s

scientist.

In the 10 years he knew Dowd,
VV1lcox said one of the professor’s pas-

sions was reading. \V1lcox said they spent I

many hours in each other’s office dis-
cussing books, from research articles to
fiction.

“Professor Dowd had a complete
life,” Wilcox said. “He had a very good
family life and very good friends. He was
a professor who thought carefully about
things and was always willing to speak up
about his ideas and opinions.”

In his immediate family, Dowd was
survived by his wife Susan Ramsmeyer
Dowd; his daughter Katherine Cramer of
Minneapolis, Mass.; and his son Michael
Dowd of Pittsburgh, Pa.

Instead of ﬂowers, the family requests
that any donations be made to the United
Way.

Not many people get the chance to
study in the same land that many bibli-
cal ﬁgures lived and died in, but this
summer the Study Abroad Office is ini-
tiating a new “Pitt in Israel” program to
change that.

Students will be led by English pro-
fessor David Brumble, associate dean
of the College of Arts and Sciences., on
the three-week trip and participating
students will earn six credits of inde-
pendent study through the Department

THE PI'l'l' NEWS

of English.

Brumble intends to attract students
in the Department of English who have
or will be taking the Bible as Literature
course offered at Pitt or students in the
fields of anthropology, archaeology, or
religious studies. The program is, how-
ever, open to all interested students.

The first week of the “Pitt in Israel”-

program will begin in Jerusalem.
Brumble will lead the students on field
trips throughout the inner walls of the
holy city to experience the different
religious quarters.

“We will visit the Church of the

                       . .     .

Iel gives students thechance to visit the

Holy Sepulcher,” Brumble said, “as
well as historic Masada, a ﬂat-topped
mountain fortress.”

Other sites of historical and reli-
gious interest like Bethlehem and the
Dead Sea will give students the oppor-
tunity to experience a wide range of
places. According to Brumble, “the old
city of Jerusalem is a museum in itself.”

The second and third week of the

“Pitt in Israel” trip takes the students to,

a kibbutz where they will eat and sleep
right next to the Sea of Galilee.
Students will then take part in a nearby
archaeological dig in Beth Saida, the

An archaeological team coordinat-
ed by the University of Nebraska-
Omaha will oversee the students’ care-
ful, painstaking fieldwork each mom-
ing. Later that day the chief archaeolo-
gist at the dig from the University of
Haifa, Israel will discuss the day’s find-
ings with the group.

Optional weekend trips during the’

stay on the kibbutz will explore the sur-
rounding area of Galilee. Students will
have the opportunity to visit the “Jesus
Boat,” a fishing boat that has been
recently discovered and said to have
sunk at the time of Christ.

The “Pitt in Israel” program
explores many different aspects and
areas of Israel. Brumble describes the
program destinations as “well off the
beaten path.” Through “Pitt in Israel,”
students will have the opportunity to
experience Israel with exciting, hands-
on participation.

Students interested in the “Pitt in
Israel” program can obtain information
in the Study Abroad Ofﬁce, 4G Forbes

Alumni

they are unsure of giving to Pitt because of
the ﬁascoes of the past and where their
money will be going.”

Strickler also said Pitt encourages its
telemarketers to focus on the academic
aspectof the University. He said this keeps
alumni from concentrating on administra-
tive and athletic faux pas.

A prime example is former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s large retirement
package. When he retired, Posvar received
a large beneﬁts package from the Board of
Trustees. Controversy erupted over the size
of the beneﬁts. Some telemarketers said
alumni are fearful that the money they
donate might go towards beneﬁts for the
administration. , -

“Even though this assumption is based
on inaccurate information, and Mr.
Posvar’s retirement package did not
involve alumni funds, it still prevents
alumni from giving,” said William
Gebauer, a graduate student at Pitt.

Many alumni are glad they’re still rec-
ognized by Pitt, but still others resent being
contacted only to give money.

“I think the majority of people I call

 

imam PAGE 

. are interested in hearing from Pitt. They’re

happy to talk with you, but they just aren’t
interested in giving,” Gebauer said, “I
would say about one in four are interested

' in giving now, and maybe an additional 50

percent are interested in giving some time
in the future, but the others just aren’t
receptive of the idea.”

Other Pitt telemarketers disagreed that
the majority of alumni are happy to hear
from Pitt. «

“Lots more people hang up than actu-

ally talk to you. As soon as they hear that '

you’re from Pitt, you hear the click,” said
telemarketer Kathleen Campbell, a Pitt
sophomore. “But once you get people to

T actually listen, about half give, and half

don’t. Most say their Pitt experience was
good, but some are mad because they
couldn’t get a job afterwards.”

All Pitt telemarketers interviewed
agreed they are also expected to provide
positive PR for Pitt. A

Many. said alumni often receive old,
inaccurate, and incomplete information
that gives them a bad impression about Pitt.
It is the telemarketer’s job to dispel the
rumors so that alumni are provided with

. the most up—to-date information.

The Alumni Association hopes that
with this current information, alumni will
be more willing to give.

“Pitt Telemarketing acts as a liaison
between the University and the alumni,”

” Chris Chaney, the evening supervisor of

Pitt Telemarketing said. “We have a low-
key approach to alumni telemarketing in

V that we allow open communication

between current students and alumni. This

. gives the alumni an outlet to voice their

comments and concerns about Pitt and
enables us to help them with their prob-
lems. We have got to care about their views

» because these are all the alumni that we

have, and we have to make them feel like
they are a contributing part of Pitt.”

The first meeting of the
Business Student Council was
held last week to inaugurate the
officers and try to bring about
dramatic changes in ﬂie College
of Business Administration and
the CAS/Dual Majors program.

The council was developed
by students of the College of
Business Administration to rep-
resent student business organi-
zations, students in the College
of Business Administration, and
the CAS/Business Dual Majors.

“What we are trying to do
is to unify the students who are

in Pitt business programs so that

:3. we can get them more involved

with each other and hopefully
create a sense of pride which
could carry on to other pro-
grams at the University,” said
newly elected BSC Vice
President Steve McCarron.

The College of Arts and
Sciences is suffering from prob-
lems in student enrollment and
drop-outs due to inefﬁcient

. advising procedures, and

Secretary Walter Michael
Olbeter said this kind of activity
is exactly what the BSC has
been set up to counteract.

“We are trying to build a
better, more efficient school of

business,” Olbeter said.

The Council proposed a
system of ﬁles for each teacher
in the school. Students could
preview these ﬁles to ﬁnd out
how an instructor teaches.

The Council wants to
implement other ideas includ-
ing a comprehensive internship
program that will make it easier
for business ‘students to ﬁnd
internships best suited to their
needs. They also want to bring
in guest speakers and to pro-

mote open forums between all '

business students so that prob
lems within the CBA and
CAS/Dual Major program
could be handled more elli-

ciently by the students.

“This is a great opportunity
for us to expand and do good
things within the business
school,” said BSC President
Norah Caldwell, in a speech at
the inauguration “I encourage

you to contribute your opinions» ‘

and ideas. ”

Although the ofﬁcers for
the BSC have been elected, they
encourage any business student
to attend future meetings next
semester. If you would like
more infonnation on the BSC
and its future activities, feel free
to contact McCarron at 942-
2437, or e—mail him at

Alumni donations are up,
number of donors is down

Although the amount of money donated by alumni has
gone up, the number of alumni donating the money has
gone down.

Most alumni donations come to the University through
telemarketing. Pitt Telemarketing uses current students to
get alumni to donate money to the University. This process
is beneficial because it allows current students to dispel the
rumors alumni may have heard about where their donated
money is being spent. An example of this is the fact that
many alumni are concerned that if they donate money it will
go to the administration rather than to the students. Alumni
were concerned upon hearing of the large retirement pack-
age former President Wesley Posvar received that their
money had been spent to this end. However, Posvar’s retire-
ment package did not use any alumni funds. ’

Alumni donations are an important part of the
University. Pitt Telemarketing deserves our congratulations
for a job well done. The fact that Pitt is- receiving greater
alumni donations while less alumni are donating is a real
accomplishment. V

To those alumni out there who are wary of donating for
fear of how their money will be used: it is important to
research the rumors you hear. Ask the telemarketers when
they call, or call the University, find out what alumni funds
are being used for, and then decide whether or not to make
a donation.

With 20 percent of the alumni population making 80
percent of the donations, one must wonder what could be
done at Pitt if more alumni donated. Would we have our

 

new convocation center? Lower tuition? A better educa- .

tional experience? We’ll only find out if more alumni
donate.

We hope the students at—Pitt Telemarketing keep up the
good work, and that the 80 percent of alumni which make
only 20 percent of the donations will open their wallets and
say “Hail to Pitt!”

We're all fighting on the some side

 

President Clinton’s victory on
Nov. 5 (attention Clinton—bashers
screaming about “impeachment”: You
lost. Get over it.) means that he will be
returning to the White House to con-
tinue to confront several formidable
challenges: entitlement reform, cam-
paign ﬁnance reform, and, perhaps
most troubling, America’s lack of
interest in foreign policy.

On election day, just four percent
of voters named foreign policy as the
issue they cared the most about.
President Clinton spent just seven min-
utes in his 1996 State of the Union
address discussing foreign affairs. Sen.
Dole’s A response to the Presidents
speech had just one reference to for-
eign policy. Quite amazing. During the
19803, the issues of the Cold War dom-
inated America, and now many people
would be hard—pressed to name the
capital of Russia (answer: Moscow).

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989. the United States has shirked its
responsibility as the world’s greatest
superpower. We won the Cold War
and then walked away from the chance
to ensure the growth of democracy. As
American attention has tumedinward
to jobs and the budget deﬁcit, our for-
eign affairs capabilities have been gut-
ted. Since 1984, our foreign aid budget
has been cut 51 percent. Now only
Egypt and Israel get any meaningful
aid.

Meanwhile, Congress has
attempted to pump $6 billion worth of
pork barrel spending into the defense
budget that the Pentagon said was
unneeded. Many congressmen regard
the defense budget as little more than a

_ jobs program for their home districts.

California lawmakers managed to
include funding increases in last year’s
budget for the costly B-2 Stealth
bomber, whose mission (evasion of
Soviet radar defenses) no longer exists.
While jobs ﬁom the B-2 program may
make a lovely gift for constituents,
they have exactly zero impact upon
America’s foreign policy. Somehow, I
don’t think that Serbians in Bosnia are
sitting around campﬁres warning each

_ other, “We had better not kill any more

Muslims or the United States.will send
a weapon designed to target Soviet
ICBM missile silos against us.”

Our foreign policy budget is so-

small now that many workers at the
State Department don’t have access to
the intemet. One foreign affairs colum-
nist pointed out that we spend more
money expanding a highway into
Washington D.C. than we do support-
ing democracy in Russia. GOP Sen.
Mitch McConnell remarked with dis-
gust that cuts in the foreign affairs bud-
get would give the United States in the
next century  visible and viable an
international role as Ghana." Without
foreign aid to offer other nations as an
incentive to cooperate with us, we
have little inﬂuence in the world.

Put into ofﬁce to deal with domes-
tic issues like taxes and welfare reform,
our elected ofﬁcials are ignorant of for-
eign policy issues. According to one
magazine I read, one congressman
closed off a foreign policy brieﬁng by
asking what the capital of Aﬁica is.

Another problem is partisanship.
The number of bipartisan votes on for-
eign policy in the 104th Congress was
the lowest since World War H. Many
members of Congress are narrow-
minded ideologues like North Carolina
Sen. Jesse Helms, whose only desire
seems to be one to upstage the presi-

dent. The contract with America’s
“National Security Revitalization Act”
was designed primarily to deprive the
president of his authority as comman-
der-in-chief. It is ironic that the very
same people who complained about
congressional micromanagement of
the Vietnam War would seek to do the
same thing now.

The key to any successful foreign
policy is bipartisanship. During the
Cold War, Democrats and Republicans
usually set aside their differences on
important issues and remembered that
we are all on the same side. In 1947,
Republicans cooperated

serve democracy in Europe. In 1995.
Sen. Dole ignored the partisans in his
party and backed President Clinton’s
plan to send peacekeepers into Bosnia,
despite negative public opinion, rather
than using the issue to beat the presi-
dent unfairly. Sen. Dole took a coura-
geous, principled route, but it appears
that the Clinton—Dole nonaggression
pact over Bosnia may be an isolated
incident that will likely not be duplicat-
ed in the future.

I hope that President Clinton will
name a strong man like George
Mitchell to replace the retiring Warren
Christopher as secretary of state. I also
hope that he will expand the NATO
alliance to include eastern European
nations and will stand up to those in
Congress who wish to leave America
with a paper tiger for a foreign policy.
Hopefully those isolationists can be
persuaded that an intemationalist for-
eign policy can only beneﬁt America
in the long run.

everyone to remember that there is a

It’s a shame that we go to a school
where most students suck.

They don’t, vote for SGB elections,
they don’t stay past halftime at football
games, they let The Pitt News form huge
piles of litter on Oakland streets, and they
don’t even know about Pitt teams besides
football and men’s basketball.

Pitt hosted the Big East Volleyball
Championships this weekend ‘ at
Fitzgerald Field House, and few students
noticed. Pitt’s volleyball team is one of
the best teams this school has to offer, but -
that doesn’t matter to the majority of you
pathetic people.

I must confess, I’m guilty of all the
violations that were just stated. I still
could give a shit about the SGB. The only
thing I’ve ever seen them accomplish was ‘
the pretty clock outside the union. I have
left football games early —— that’s one

A ’ where we’re all guilty. It’s fun to see your
name and picture on the sidewalk with a '

big footprint across it, so I litter The Pitt
News any chance I get. And before I
worked here, I only attended football,
men’s hoops, and men’s soccer games.

I must also admit that the fate of the

-volleyball team never caused me to lose

any sleep, and I never saw a Pitt volley-

« ball game until this weekend.

Man, am I an idiot. ~

Pitt may have lost to Notre Dame in
yesterday’s championship game, but that
can’t discourage my new ‘attitude — an
attitude I encourage all of you to adopt.

You see, these females are out there
busting their butts. In the words of Head
Coach Cindy Alvear, “They bleed blue
and gold.” ‘ ' »

The last time that was muttered by
any Pitt athlete was by defensive end
Jason Chavis, before the football season
started.

Poor shooting and turnovers by the
Panthers led to a 69-50 opening game
embarrassment to Illinois State last night at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

The loss to the Redbirds was Pitt’s ﬁrst
season home-opener defeat in 14 years. The
loss was also Pitt’s worst non-conference
loss at the Field House since 1968 when
they lost to Georgia Tech by 30 points.

Coach Ralph Willard summed up the
game saying, “We got beat in every facet of
the game.”

Pitt shot only 34 percent from the ﬁeld
while Illinois State dominated Pitt in nearly
every statistical category . ‘including
rebounds (47-30), three—point ﬁeld goals (5-
2), turnovers and steals. ‘ —

Pitt played without forward Chad
Varga, who is out indeﬁnitely with a leg
injury. The team leader dressed for the game
but did not see action. Center Gerald Jordan
didn’t play either while nursing a sore left
foot.

‘There is a real tentativeness right now
without Chad and Gerald on the ﬂoor,”
Wﬂlard said. “Until we get them back, it’s
going to be a tough proposition. Right now
we’re not physical" enough”.

Despite Illinois State’s dominance

- inside and Pitt’s reliance on a small lineup,

guard Vonteego Cummings refused to use
Varga’s and Jordan’s absence as an excuse.

“We could use (injuries) as an excuse
all day long,” Cummings said, “but if we
came out to play like we know we can play
and did the little things, we would have won
tonight”

Defensively, the Panthers looked solid,
especially in the ﬁrst half. But 24-percent
shooting in the ﬁrst 20 minutes put the
Panthers in an insurmountable hole. Pitt

Center Mark Blount c<m’t hide from Pil1’s worst non-conference home loss since 1969.

scored only 20 points in the ﬁrst half, with
center Mark Blount showing the only sign
of life. He led Pitt with seven points, eight
rebounds, and three blocks.

After the game, Coach Willard summa-
rized the Panthers’ ﬁrst-half performance.

“We couldn’t put the basketball in the
ocean,” Willard said “A good defensive
effort went for naught”

Illinois State featured a balanced attack
all game long with guard Skipp Schaefbauer
leading the Redbirds with 16 points.
Forward Rico Hill contributed 10 points and

eight rebounds. ,

Illinois State may have surprised some
people,5but Coach Kevin Stallings returned
four starters from a team that went 22- 12 last
year and advanced to the quarterﬁnals of the
post-season NI'I‘.

“We knew it would be a tough game,”
 said. “[But] we didn’t do what
Coach Wﬂlard said. They kickedour butts in
every aspect of the game. We got embar-
rassed on our own court” 3

Since the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame entered the Big
East last year, Pitt has failed to
win the ‘Big East Volleyball
Championship, something they
owned for the previous decade.

Yesterday, Pitt (22-11, 10-
3) fell behind two sets to none
and eventually fell to the 24th-
ranked Lady Irish 15-5, 15-6,
13-15, and 15-10 in the cham-
pionship game. The loss virtual-

Peggy Meinhart's five blocks weren't enough to win.

on the team, Alvear says what -
the two ﬁrst—team All-Big East
performers did was even more
special.

“Driscoll and Dufresne
carried a tremendous amount of
weight all season,” Alvear said.
“It’s tough on the younger girls
to stay with it mentally all the
time. Sometimes, they can’t
stay in it.”

That was evident yester-
day. With Pitt trailing 6-4, Notre
Dame took charge, taking ,
advantage of a ntunber of ser-
vice errors to take a 94 lead.
Notre Dame, led by Big East

ly eliminates Pitt from playing
in the NCAA Tournament.
“We won’t know until a

. week from today [Sunday],”

Head Coach Cindy Alvear said.
‘‘There’s 10 teams looking at

two slots.”

The loss probably marks
the end of Jennie Driscol1’s and
Stephanie Dufresne’s respec-
tive careers. The seniors did
their best to keep the Panthers in

the game. Driscoll registered 14
kills, seven digs, and ﬁve
blocks. Dufresne, as usual, led
Pitt with 53 assists.

After his team’s 64-55 loss to the
Virginia Cavaliers, Lady Panther
Head Coach Kirk Bruce tried his
best not to be happy.

Normally, a loss makes this easy
for a coach, but not on Friday night
— not when Bruce’s unranked and
inexperienced squad opened their
season with a tight game against the
seventh-ranked team in the country.

“I knew we were capable of
playing like this,” said Bruce after
the loss. “I knew it. This was the
team that won two games in the Big
East Tournament last year.”

While the team has changed a bit
since those March upsets, they have
improved immensely since last
November when the Cavaliers best-
ed Pitt 103-56.

Friday’s game opened with a
similar _Virginia dominance, made
possible by 13 Cavalier offensive
rebounds compared to three for the
Lady Panthers. Virginia’s Monick
Foote, coming off the bench after
preseason ankle surgery, led her
team’s first-half. scoring with eight
points, including two three—pointers.

Foote would finish with 18
-points despite her injury —— one of
many hurt visitors who, according to
Bruce, somehow managed to pro-
duce inside the Fitzgerald Field
House.

“It’s like the faith healer touches
them and, ‘Boom!,”’ said the coach.
“I remember»Monick. She made six
three-pointers last year.”

Answering for the Panthers in
the first half was junior Latia
Howard, who led all scorers with 12
early points. Her closest teammate,
however, checked in with only five,
and the Panthers fell into a 37-27
halftime hole.

While Virginia was not on their
way to triple digits like last season,
the Cavaliers did have a command-
ing lead early in the second half. The
Lady Panthers slashed the lead to as
low as five, but Virginia would pull
away to a 59-50 advantage with only

4 3:19 left in the contest.

Bruce called a timeout, and re-
deployed his defense. The team
responded, as Howard blocked a
Cavalier jumper to force a shot-
clock violation. Missy ‘Thompson
then registered a layup, and Jo Jo
Guzman scored all three of her see-
ond-half points long bombs from
almost a foot beyond the three—point
arc.

Down by four and visibly shak-
en, the Cavaliers went back to
basics. Foote crashed the boards yet
again and put back a teammate’s
miss to bring the lead up to six. A

\\

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

Pitt travel on the next possession put
the game out of reach.

Despite the final score, Bruce
was quite pleased with the perfor-
mance.

“We gained a little bit of respect
in this game,” said the coach. “I’m
so very proud of these young ladies.
How could you not be?”

Thompson finished second to
Howard’s 21 points with 10 of her
own, along with a team-high ' six
rebounds. Guzman recorded eight,
including two three-pointers.
Leading the team’s youth movement
was freshman Michelle Katkowski,
who had four points as well as five
of the team’s 10 offensive boards.

Virginia’s DeMya Walker, sub-
ject to double—teaming for most of
the contest, scored 14 points. Guard
Tora Suber finished with nine points,
and Tiffany Bower led the Cavaliers
with seven rebounds.

The crowd of 1,209 —— the
largest for a Lady Panther home
game since last year’s City Game
against Duquesne — had a large
Virginia contingent, especially when

‘it came to Cavalier freshman Jackie

Glessner. The Brothervalley High
graduate from Berlin, Pa. had what
amounted to a homecoming party,
scoring seven points in limited
action to the delight of a whole sec-
tion of fans.

Pin grappler Matusic sees the error of Penn State's ways

B on Knovish

  

After graduating from high school in
1992, wrestling phenom Bryan Matusic
committed the most unthinkable of acts
— he enrolled at Penn State. Not to
worry, though —— he soon realized the
error of his ways and brought his grap-
pling skills to Pitt.

After the national powerhouse
Nittany Lions redshirted him as a fresh-
man, Matusic quickly emerged as a col-
legiate standout and qualiﬁed for the
nationals in his second year, a feat usual-
ly worthy of more than the 25—percent
scholarship he was receiving.

Penn State would not increase their
offer, so he decided to transfer. Pitt seized
the opportunity and offered him a full-
ride.

“It was more than just the money,”
Matusic said. “I was not happy with the
coaching at Penn State.”

He explained that the Penn State
coaching style was primarily that of neg-
ative reinforcement.

“When you’d lose a match, they’d
criticize you and magnify the negatives,”
he said.

“But here, even if you lose, the
coaches’ criticism if far more construc-
tive. They not only make us aware of
what we did wrong, but also emphasize
the positive aspects of the match. That

kind of thing never happened at Penn

State.”

The Pitt wrestling coaches wel-
comed Matusic with open arms.

-“We recruited him heavily right out
of high school,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemeyer said. “When he decided to
come back to Pittsburgh, we were more
than happy to make him another offer. I
think Pitt was a better fit for him. He saw
the merits of what we had to offer, not
just athletically, but academically as
well.”

Matusic, who boasts a 3.5 grade—point
average and is a two-time Academic All-
American. He’s a neuroscience major
who plans on attending medical school
after graduation.

“Coach Stottlemeyer remembers that
the real reason we’re here is to get an
education,” Matusic said. “At Penn State,
academics weren’t even an issue for ath-
letes. Eligibility was all they cared about.
As long as you maintained your C aver-
age, they were happy.”

Matusic’s wrestling debut was not

exactly what you’d call earth-shattering.
He began wrestling in the second grade.
where he lost all of his matches. He was
too afraid to even go out on the mat for
three of them.

Things have changed. 9

Matusic compiled a stellar ll4—l6
record while at Cannon McMillian High
School. He placed fourth in the
Pennsylvania state championships as a
sophomore and only a late-season injury
prevented him from placing again. as a
junior. During his senior year, he finished
second in the state and and compiled an
impressive 39-1 record, with his only loss
coming in the state championship ﬁnals.
He followed that up with a third—place
finish at the National High School
Championships. ‘

Matusic’s collegiate record stands at
81-39; he currently ranks seventh on
Pitt’s all—time wins list. With. a good sea-
son, it’s possible he could jump all the
way to second on the list, where former
Pitt great Scott Hovan now stands with
118 wins (Pat Santoro is first with 139).

He has already qualiﬁed for nation-
als three times. He ﬁnished second in the
Eastern Wrestling League as a sopho-
more and third last season.

As far as personal goals ‘for the
upcoming season go, Matusic wants to be
national Champion. 1

. guts, emotion, and ﬁre this weekend. On

Saturday, they beat conference rival (and
morally classless) Villanova University.
Automatically, they enamored me.

It’s no secret. I hate Villanova.
Villanova is ﬁlled with thousands of prep-
py bastards who think their fecal emis-
sions don’t stink because their parents can
afford to send them to school for $30,000
a year.

It was pleasurable to see Pitt wallop
Nova three sets to one. It was also fun to
hear the volatile Nova crowd get a big
glass of shut—the—he1l—up after it was
apparent that we were better.

Yesterday’s loss to Notre Dame
reminded me why I loved Pitt as a child

P and why I grew up dreaming of coming '

here (though some dreams turn ugly).

The Panthers dropped the first two
sets to the n'ationally—ranked Fighting
Irish, who packed Player of the Year
Jaimie Lee with them. Pitt didn’t look too
good those first two sets.

But the third set was different. As
easily as Pitt could have closed up shop,
they played for pride —- Panther Pride.

 

Monday, November 25, ‘I996

FROM PAGE 8 

Remember Panther Pride? Probably not.
Since I’m a little older than most of you,
and I can barely remember Panther Pride,
I wouldn’t expect you to.

The volleyball team came out and

forced the third set from the Irish, shoving
spikes down their collective faces and
getting to every loose ball. You could see
it in the players’ faces — Panther Pride.
However, nobody else was there to see it.
That’s a shame. ’
' Besides the volleyball team, Pitt does
have a few other teams that deserve the
support of the student body. Our national-
ly—ranked wrestling team comes to mind.
They’ll be good for years, but will any-
body notice?

The Pitt News tries to inform readers
of these unsung heroes, the teams and
players who get no respect from the stu-
dent body. But the only way to truly
appreciate their efforts is to go see them
play. The wrestling‘ team kicks off its sea-
son tomorrow" night at the Field House.

Mike Kovak is the lame—duck sports edi-
tor for The Pitt News-

lbs.],” he explained. “The number-one

_ranked guy [Erich Harvey of Michigan
State] only beat me 6-4 last year, and the ‘
number two ranked guy [Mike Geurin of A ‘

Lock Haven] beat me 1-0.”

As the wrestling tearn’s only senior,
Matusic’s importance to the team extends
beyond pure wins and losses. He and
junior John Withrow have been elected
as captains for the upcoming season.

“I think Bryan understands his lead-

ership role,” Assistant Coach Dan Payne

said. “He leads by example, through his

work ethic and toughness.”

Younger players said they look up to I

Matusic. -
“He’s a role model for us younger
guys,” said freshman Rob Loper. “He
can relate to us, not just in wrestling, but
in our personal lives as well.”

Pitt fans hope that Matusic can lead
the Panthers to an EWL title this season.
The first step in that quest comes next

Tuesday, Nov. 26, when the wrestlers

open their season at home against
Bloomsburg.

Volleyball 

Panthers in game two as well. Notre Dame
took advantage and took a 3-0 lead after
Pitt’s Jessica Van Der Mallie hit one into the
net. And when Pitt did make plays, Notre
Dame still came outwith a sideout or point.
With Pitt down 8-5, a great volley featuring
several sliding Panther digs ended up in a
Notre Dame kill.

.“Mentally, I think the kids were a little
intimidated,” Alvear said. V

They weren’t intimidated for game
three. _ ,

‘‘I’m not the kind of coach who raises
her Voice often,” Alvear said. “I don’t coach

‘ that way — that probably had an effect.”

The play of freshmen Julie Cress and
Peggy Meinhart deﬁnitely had an eﬂ’ect . '

Meinhart opened the scoring with one
of her team-high ﬁve blocks. She then had a
kill for point two. Cress put the smack—down
on the Irish for point three and another
Meinhart block put Pitt up 4-0.

Notre Dame did make things diﬂicult in
game three, however. At one point, Pitt’s

 

. lead was trimmed to 7-6. Then, the Panthers

erupted for a 13-7 lead, only to see the Irish
trim the margin to 14-13. Luckily, a Cress
kill ﬁnished off the game. .

Lee and tournament MVP Lindsay
Treadwell were too much to handle in game
four. The two combined for 37 kills on the
day and basically wore out ‘a tired Panther
defense. Treadwell hit for an astronomical
.548 hitting percentage. A

“Notre Dame is more experienced,”
Alvear said. “But, at times, we let them beat
us. Jessica [Van Der Mallie] really stumbled
the last game and she had been the one who
really stepped up the last couple weeks.” ,

Pitt reached the final after defeating
Villanova on Saturday 18-16, 15-7, 12-15,
and 15-9.

Despite the hard-fought victory, Alvear
didn’t think the game tired out her players.

“We’re deep enough not to have an
effect,” Alvear said. “I don’t think it had a
negative effect, in fact, it was a positive
effect.” '
