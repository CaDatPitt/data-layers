thief caught

Brett Taylor
Asslstant News Edltor

Thomas W1lcox’s arrest record is eight or nine pages
long.

This is according to Charles Bonasorte, owner of the Pitt
Stop, who caught Wilcox attempting to steal a box of hats
from a Pit Stop supply truck on March 17.

Bonasorte said a district judge later issued a detainer on
Wﬂcox because he has a history_ of 20 or 30 anests, includ-
ing aggravated assault of a Carnegie Mellon University
police oﬂicer. I

Bonasorte said that Wilcox is presently serving ﬁve
years of probation for the assault of the CMU oﬂicer.

Wilcox was wanted by CMU police for stealing nearly
20 bicycles at CMU and Pitt over the last two years, accord-
ing to Bonasorte. He said most of W1lcox’s prior arrests were
for theft and that he was stealing bicycles and other things to
pay for his drug habit.

“He’s a lifetime thief, nickle and dime kinds of things,”
Bonasorte said “He’s been preying on people in Oakland for
years.”

No one from the CMU police department would com-
ment on W1lcox’s aggravated assault or theft charges.

I Bonasorte said that at his arraignment last week, Wilcox
begged the judge to admit him into a drug program instead
of holding him over for court at a later date.

According to Bonasorte, the judge told Wilcox that if he
really wanted help, he could have received some a long time
ago, and that his request was just an attempt to avoid jail
time.

Bonasorte said that on March 17, a customer alerted him
that somebody was in the truck, across the street from his
outdoor shop on the northwest comer of Forbes and Bigelow
Avenues. He then chased Wilcox down, tackled him and

pinned him to the ground until the police arrested him,
according to Bonasorte.

Bonasorte said that Wilcox made several attempts to
escape —— he asked Bonasorte to let him smoke a cigarette
and to remove his muddy sweatshirt Each time Bonasorte
removed his hands, Wrlcox tried to run and had to be tackled
again, Bonasorte said.

“Eventually he just ran out of energy. He’d really been
trying to get away, but he was real tired,” he added.

Bonasorte said Wilcox offered him money to let him go,
but Bonasorte refused and told Wilcox he was going to jail.

Wlcox reportedly gave several alias names to the police
to avoid being identiﬁed, but oﬂicers later recognized him as

Bonasorte said the box of hats was a promotional set that
he used as a display. The hats were faded from months of sit-

Alleged billing disputes of
Medicare and Medicaid patients will
cost the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine’s 18 clinical prac-
tice plans $17 million.

The issue involves discrepancies
in the billings of the Medicare and
Medicaid patients between 1990 and
1996. The total of the doctors’
billings in that six-year period was
$250 million.

Pitt’s audit showed that a super-
vising doctor wasn’t always docu-
mented as being present on the bills
sent to Medicare. By not always fol-
lowing the rules stipulated by
Medicare, Pitt is now paying the gov-
ernment $17 million.

According to Dufﬁeld, one of the
reasons behind the faulty documenta-
tion submitted by Pitt’s doctors is that
many regulations used by the Health
Care Financing Administration tend
to be ambiguous.

In 1996, Medicaid and Medicare

Medicare requires written proof

when a resident doctor treated a

Otherwise, the resident, who is a
certified doctor getting specialty
training, isn’t eligible for certain
refunds from Medicare and Medicaid.

Pitt decided to hold an indepen-
dent audit in response to OIG’s
billing questions.

“We had an option to do our own
audit or have the government do one
for us. We chose to do our own,” said
Duffield.

filed a lawsuit in
October of 1997
against the U.S.
government to put an end to the cur-

program — the initiative OIG started
to investigate the billings.

Duffield said there was no evi-
dence of fraud or intentional over-
billing of patients and that adminis-
trative error seems to be the core of
the problem.

Pitt, UPMC, and its doctors
decided to pay the government the
funds rather than go through exten-
sive litigation, according to Duffield.

Blumenfeld, a Pitt junior, said

women should carry their own con-»

doms rather then expecting the men to
provide them. She agreed with Decky
that college—age people just don’t care
about the long—term effects of their
actions, that people want to live for the
moment.

This laid—back attitude can have
crucial effects that many people tend
to forget in their quest of instant grati-
fication. The statistics tell a grim tale
of lifein the ‘90s.

HIV infection rates have leveled
and held at a steady rate over the last
few years, but the rates within the dif-
ferent groups have changed. What
began as a “gay disease” in the early
‘80s has progressed from a communi-
ty’s epidemic to a world—wide concern.

Right now, persons living with
full-blown AIDS number over
216,000, while 650,000 to 900,000
people live with HIV, according to the
Centers for Disease Control.

One of the reasons more people
are living longer with HIV may be the
new drug therapies available that are
capable of suppressing the virus’ lev-
els in the bloodstream. People diag-
nosed HIV-positive can sign up to join
study groups that test some of the new
drugs.

Even though these drugs can be
miracles to many participants, lots of
people fail to realize the strict limita-
tions on group size, the huge expanse
of the drugs, the possibility of side
effects and just the overall hassle of

“Some of my
friends won’t go on the HIV drugs
because they are afraid of the long-

term effects that no one knows about

yet,” said Matthew Moyer, director of
the Youth Empowerment Program, a
group affiliated with the ~Pitt Men’s
Study. The Pitt Men’s Study runs an
HIV drug study program and is an
HIV testing site.

“Many people don’t want to come
in to get tested because they are afraid
to hear they are HIV-positive,” said
Moyer.

Meyer said early detection is
important for controlling the disease
with drug therapy. People remain
unaware they are HIV-positive
because they don’t get tested regularly.

ment. He said the “don’t ask don’t 

tell” attitude is basically in effect with

government jobs that deal with the
public directly, so he wished to remain
anonymous.

“AIDS is a concern, but since I’m
celibate for the most part, it doesn’t
scare me. I just worry about my
friends who aren’t as careful as me,”
he said.

Garnish said the way AIDS is most
dangerous is that people feel they are
invincible, and this omnipotent belief
makes people do dumb things like
have unprotected sex.

“AIDS is like a chain letter. One
person has it, gives to 10 others and
those 10 give it to 10 more  it’s a
vicious cycle,” Granish said.

WASHINGTON — Paper or plastic?

The U.S. government is testing new
materials for folding money —— including a
tough but ﬂexible plastic.

Advocates say plastic bills last longer
than paper, are more dilﬁcult to counterfeit
and don’t get all wrinkled if you accidental-
ly leave them in your jeans on wash day.

They are also less prone to rejection by
change machines. And when they wear out,
they can be recycled into other plastic prod-
ucts.

Skeptics wony the public would reject
them, that they would force an expensive re-
tooling of currency-sorting and counting
machines and that such a radical change
could subtly undermine conﬁdence in the
U.S. dollar.

Both agree it would give a new mean-

Fork in the road of
medicine’s future

The Supreme Court started hearing arguments yester-
day in a case that may pave the way for the future of health
care in this country. ,

Nine justices will decide whether HIV counts as a dis-
ability in the language and spirit of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. If they decide it does, then doctors, nurs-
es, dentists and anybody else who provides a service to the
public will not be allowed to discriminate against those
with HIV — that is to say, surgeons and dentists will be not
be allowed to refuse treatment to those with the disease.

On the other hand, if they decide HIV does not count
as a disability — even though many, including the Clinton
administration, claim it should be considered a reproduc-
tive disability —— then health care professionals will have
the choice not to treat HIV-infected patients.

As far as it is a legal matter, the decision rests entirely
with the Supreme Court. But as much as it is an ethical and
practical matter, the whole country should be hoping the
Court holds that HIV counts as a disability. ‘

Americans pay a great deal of money for health plans
and insurance, and those who don't often end up paying
more if they need those services. The fact that insurance
even exists is a sign that Americans expect to receive that
care when they need it, and that insurers expect hospitals
to provide it. -

But even more important than the money is the fact
that doctors hold the god-like power to give and take life.
We need physicians who respect that power and who
chose to take it in order to do good with it, not just to help
themselves.

HMOS and rapid developments in technology, med-
ical knowledge, and the proliferation of information will
probably turn the world of medicine ugly in the coming
years.

A Supreme Court decision now that begins to estab-
lish medicine as a public service instead of a private indus-
try may be one of the few things that can push the future
of health care in the right direction.

Physicians don't take the Hippocratic Oath anymore,
and even if they did, mouthing a few words doesn't guar-
antee that a person is committed to helping people.
Unfortunately, it seems that many go into medicine
because of the money — or because their parents gave
them a choice of doctor or lawyer -- without really desir-
ing to help anybody.

If laws and policies made it less appealing to those
who are more concerned with living long, wealthy lives
than with helping those who need medical attention, it
might become less and less of a misnomer to call the work
health care. ’

OPINIONS

Co-op housing
is more than
editorial made
it out to be

As one who lived in a student
cooperative for two years as an
undergraduate, I must respond to the
editorial in the March 23 issue of The
Pitt News, "Communes: a really bad
idea." The editorial struck me as
being a poorly thought—out reaction
to a proposal that offends the author.
The author makes several assump-
tions that are not supported either by
the front page article ("Co-op hous-
ing solution olfer ") or by my own
co-op experiences.

First, it is not necessary for one
person to be "in charge" of a co-op in
order to address and resolve conflicts
or other issues as they come up. My
co-op could, and did, kick out people
whom we decided were not pulling
their own weight or were disruptive
to the community. These were group
decisions, not ones that should be
made by one person. The fact that we
took on the responsibility as a group
is in itself a measure of how we
viewed our community: as a collec-
tion of equal individuals who were
living and workingtogether for our
mutual beneﬁt and enjoyment.

Second, the author is under the
impression that any co-op is auto-
matically an anarchic institutionand
thus would be incapable of making
decisions or getting things done. The
front-page story mentions that the
co-op would rent a building for their
collective use. The author assumes

Letters to the editor may be
addressed to the Opinions
Editor, 434 Wm. Pitt Union,

The Pitt News

that if something went wrong with
the building, the coop, being leader-
less, would be unable to cope. That
may be his/her personal experience
with student living arrangements, but
it is hardly the rule.

The landlord, as in most rental
agreements, would be responsible
for any repairs mandated by the lease
— how is this any different from
having one's own apartment? Why
would a co-op automatically be inca-
pable of obtaining or effecting such
repairs?

The author further states, "Most
students also carmot afford the
$200+ fee that can come with a
plumbers house call." By pooling
their resources, 15 people could eas-
ily afford such an expense, should it
for some reason not be covered in
their lease. This is one of the princi-
ples behind co-ops, that by spreading
out the cost you can afford to live
better“. Consider the party 15 people
working together can pull off. The
author's argument here actually sup-
ports, rather than refutes, the idea of
cooperative living.

Third, cooperatives do in fact
tend to have a leadership within their
organization. Why does the author
assume that chaos would reign?
Every co-op I have been associated
with has had someone to whom the
phrase "The buck stops here"
applies. In an emergency, that person
is the one who can make a quick
decision and get things done, and

who can mediate differences

between members. (If only more
roommates had such an arrange-
ment.)

Usually, in fact, the membership
of a co-op deems such a position of
sufficient importance that being the
"loose ends coordinator" (to use a
phrase borrowed from the Oberlin
Student Cooperative Association)
counts as a large part of the weekly
work expected of that member.

As the main story said, student
cooperatives have been very suc-
cessful at a number of institutions.
They offer students a chance to get
out of the dorms without leaving the
college behind. In exchange for
accepting some responsibility
(which the author overlooked) and
doing some work, students can live
in a nicer, better-maintained, more
enjoyable, and considerably cheaper
enviromnent than would be possible
either in a University-rim group liv-
ing enviromnent (dorms), other stu-
dent-oriented living
(fraternities/sororities), or on their
own.

Among my fondest memories
from college are sitting around the

ﬁreplace, munching on fresh-baked ~

bread, talking to people who not only
lived around me but also worked
with me to make the bread (and also
to clean up the ﬁreplace).

Quotas don't equal fairness

Carrie Hager

columnist

People should be hired for jobs or
admitted to college based on ability,
not race, gender or economic situation.
Now, don't get me wrong, affirmative
action was needed in the past when
women and minorities suffered from
extreme discrimination. But now,
although some discrimination still
exists, and unfortrmately may always
exist, women and minorities have
come a long way with equal ﬁghts,
and afﬁrmative action is .no longer
necessary.

According to a New York
Tirnes/CBS news poll, Americans
want diversity but aren't happy with

present means to achieve it. Forty-1

three percent of those surveyed feel
that affirmative action programs
should be changed, and 25 percent
believe aﬂirmative j

because the company needed another
woman on its payroll to satisfy a
quota, I would feel very insulted and
look for a different place to work.

Being able to take pride in what I
do is very important to me, and I'm
sure most people like to take pride in
what they do. Afﬁrmative action takes
that pride away. It says that you're not
good enough to get the job on your
own, so we'll give you special treat-
ment. There's no wonder why many
Americans, including many women
and minorities, ﬁnd aﬂirmative action
insulting.

Eighty—eight percent of blacks and
65 percent of whites feel it is necessary
to have laws to protect minorities from

‘ discrimination in hiring. Laws to pro-

tect from discrimination are of course
needed. But that is very different ﬁ'om
guaranteeing employment.

Another problem with afﬁrmative

those less qualiﬁed because of their
gender, race or economic situation, we
can offer job training or programs to
assist minorities who are competing
for jobs or admission to college.
More than 60 percent of
Americans are in.favor of these kinds
of programs according to the poll.

With such programs in place, minori-

ties could compete without special
treatment and could get a job based
strictly on their
abilities.

Even as a
woman, I am com-
pletely opposed to
afﬁrmative action.
Many companies
are required to hire
a certain number
of women and
minorities to ﬁll a
quota, but I never
want to be part of a
quota. I ﬁnd it to
be very insulting.
When I graduate
and go searching
for a job, I am con-
ﬁdent that my abilities will land me
one. But if someone is better than I, as

much as I'd'lik3é‘ the job, the other can; ‘

We must fight racism actively 

John
Lacny

When the struggle for social justice
falls on hard times, those who long for jus-
tice need to cultivate a sharp sense of irony
if they want to maintain their sanity. It is
extremely discouraging, then,
when an irony is not even mild-
ly amusing.

Indeed, there are some
ironies which are palpably nau-
seating. I am thinking of the
most retrograde racist oppo-
nents of racial equality and the
means to achieve said racial
equality (i.e., affirmative
action), who have lately been
appropriating for their purposes
none other than Martin Luther
King Jr.

Take Gov. Mike Foster of
Louisiana, who was elected in 1996, as. a

   

  

    

  
   

ignorant, they are dissembling shamelessly.
It is true that King would not have support-
ed "reverse discrimination," in the sense
that he would not have advocated the per-
petration against white people of the same

cial for the Negro." ”

In the March 26 issue of The Pitt News,
James Maude related the appalling story of
Vryburg, South Africa, where a scene orig-
inally played out forty years ago in Little
Rock, Ark. is being re-enacted before the
eyes of the world. Maude pointed out that,
in addition to the problem of violent resis-
tance by diehard segregationists, "Another
problem is that black pupils are being
absorbed into these schools while having
had an inferior education beforehand in a
derelict township school (which was the
intention of the apartheid government's pol-
icy), but no extra help is being afforded
them." The injustice here is clearly seen;
only the most blindly racist would deny the
necessity of afﬁrmative action programs in
today's South Africa. ‘

But I would hasten to remind you, dear

 
    
     

a 

 
 
   
  

reader, that the United States is not very
long out of its own system of legalized
apartheid. If not within the lifetime of
today's university students, then within the
lifetime of their parents, "white" and "col-
ored" drinking fountains, segregated restau-
rants, Ku Klux Klan lynchings, and similar
unforgivable hor-

H rors were ubiqui-

tous 1n the
American South.
And despite Dinesh
D'Souza's procla-
mation of "the end
of racism," their
legacy is with us
still.

Let's see some of
the obligatory sta-
tistics. The ofﬁcial
unemployment rate
' for those aged 20-
24 in 1994 was 8.1 percent for whites, 19.5
percent for blacks," and 11.8 percent for
Latinos, according to the Bureau of Labor
'stig;,s The poverty rate in 1993 was

;« f 33.1 percent for

  

   
   
  
   

   
  
  

ioned ra ism, but you knew that already,
didn't you, dear reader? Whether you're for
afﬁrrnative action or against it.

I can't resist pointing out, though, that
another thing indicated by the. statistics
above is the appalling level of poverty and
unemployment in the United States, regard-

less of race. That one-third of the African-

tion lives below the pover-
enough; it should also be
-eighth of the white pop-
_ specially in the richest
, of the earth.

5: :et that the famous event
 I   . fred those imperishable
words about the content of our character
was known as the March on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom. -King understood well
that the struggle for racial equality was only
one part (although an indispensable part) of
the larger struggle for social justice and that
just as racial equality could only be
achieved through ambitious programs like
affirmative action, so the elimination of
poverty could only be achieved through
ambitious programs like the guaranteed
income.

April 4 is the 30th anniversary of
.Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.
Those of us who honor his memory would
do well not only to preserve his legacy, but
to enhance it.

Weather and
Jelly-BeIIy’s point
to Opening Day

The weather in Pittsburgh at the
end of March typically resembles the
end of a bag of assorted Jelly—Belly’s: a
little bit of sleet, maybe some snow, a
bunch of rain and skies grayer than a
monsoon. Basically, it’s all the stuff you
really don’t want.

But over the" last several days, El
Nino has been very kind to us, giving
Pittsburghers plenty of sun and 80-
degree temperatures.

The weather seems to have trans-
formed people’s attitudes and has
revealed many signs that summer is
near.

Stroll past the Cathedral and see
the lawn teeming with well-oiled and
scantily clad sun bathers. Walk toward
the Union and see 50 percent of the carn-
pus choosing to do a little opposite-sex
sightseeing instead of going to class.
Saunter through the Towers and see
freshman co—eds showing off their new
outﬁts (and fake-bakes).

After months of winter, these signs
are all welcome sights and give a good
glimpse of what lies ahead.

But the first true sign of summer
begins tomorrow, slightly after 1:00
p.m. That’s when the baseball season
ofﬁcially starts.

What exactly does that mean?

For starters, it means no more nasty
tasting coconut Jelly—Belly’s. That’s
right, no more snow (it’s just not
allowed after Opening Day).

It means that tongue-curling but-
tered popcorn Jelly—Belly’s (rock salt)
will give way to sweet tasting strawber-
ry ones (tulips).

It means that blueberry and lemon
Jelly—Belly’s (blue skies and sunshine)
will replace licorice and chocolate ones
(dark skies).

In short, it means that people will
get exactly what they want — without
any of the nasty leftovers.

There is no other time of year like
this one, when everything starts to look
ahead. And there is no other sport quite
like baseball.

Baseball epitomizes what is right
about athletics. It’s the only sport where
you’re not supposed to rush. In fact,
leisure is built right into the game with
pauses in between each pitch.

It’s the only sport played in the
summer, the quintessential time to be
outside and relax.

Davidson, WVU take weekend
games, Pitt faces Bonnies today

Sports Edltor

In six hours last Saturday,
the Pitt tennis team played 15
matches against two different
opponents at one place — the
unfriendly confines of
Morgantown, W. Va.

After those six hours, the
Panthers left Morgantown
without winning a match, los-
ing, 5-0, to the host
Mountaineers and dropping a
6-0 decision to the Davidson
Wildcats.

“When you play teams
like [these], you learn an
awful lot about the game of
tennis,” said Pitt Head Coach
George Dieffenbach. “You
kind of imitate your competi-
tion.”

Davidson and West

Virginia squared off early
Saturday morning, with the
Mountaineers taking a 6-3
win in a ﬁve-hour match up.

The Wildcats went on to play
Pitt after the marathon, but
had to cut the contest short
after the singles matches due
to travel considerations.

Even without the doubles . 0

matches to pad the score
sheet, the VV1ldcats disman-
tled the Panthers —— only
third—seed Fran Davis and
sixth—seed Alison Bucher
both came close to taking a
set, both playing to 5-7
against their Davidson oppo-
sition.

' Bucher put in the best
effort, losing her match 6-3,
7-5.

“We have a deep team,
and that shows when you play
good teams,” Dieffenbach
said when asked about
Bucher’s play at the bottom of
the Panther lineup. “Bucher
does well at that spot.”

The loss, coupled with a
loss versus West Virginia,
dropped Bucher’s record to

The National League in 1998 will be

r completely changed from last year. Two

new teams join the league this year, one via

p expansion (the Arizona Diamondbacks)

and one from the American League (the
 Milwaukee Brewers). Last year’s pennant
 winners and eventual World Series champs
§Florida Marlins will struggle to ﬁnish at
3,500. But don’t worry. The Braves won’t
’ be in the World Series.

Expect the Cardinals, Braves and
Dodgers to win their divisions with the
Padres joining the playoffs with a wild
card. Then expect the Dodgers to emerge
from the pack to make it to their ﬁrst World
Series since 1988. ' ’

Riggleman can expect some excitement
though, with the off-season acquisition of
Rod Beck and Henry Rodriguez. The
oﬁense should score more runs but their
starting pitching staff doesn’t have one
legitimate l2—game winner.

have the worst starting rotation in the

Symptoms may include tight-
ness in the chest, shortness of
breath, and wheezing.

, A heart attack?

Maybe, but these are also the
symptoms of a common illness
called asthma — a disease affecting
millions of people and a good por-
tion of the Pitt swimming team.

Thirty—two Pitt swimmers are
currently taking part in an on-going
study concerning asthma and swim-
ming, under the direction of
Kathleen Ashmen, the team trainer
and partner _in the asthma study.
According to Ashmen, 16 of the

after her swimming workouts
before she learned she had asthma.
Only then did she take steps to com-
bat her exercise-induce asthma
Seven percent of the population
suffers from asthma, and despite
effective medications that control
the condition, it is increasing in
severity, frequency and even mor-
tality, claiming more than 4,000
lives in the United States each year.
“Good management of this dis-
order is essential to a patient’s well-
being,” said Dr. William Calhoun,
University of Pittsburgh associate
professor of medicine and director
of the asthma program at the

University of Pittsburgh Medical’

Center. “The medications offered

swimmers in the
study suffer from
asthma.

The study is
divided into two

periods — the
preseason and
postseason --
and involves T

measuring the lung capacity of each
swimmer after he or she partici-
pates in swimming and running
activities.

“The point of [having] half
asthmatics and half non—asthmatics
is to have a fair study,” Ashmen
said. “Our goal is to find out the
root cause of this condition.”

Swimming was once thought to
be therapeutic for asthma sufferers,
allowing them to breathe the moist,
humid, easier—to-process air sur-
rounding the pool.

But now, researchers believe the
chemicals in the pool, such as chlo-
rine, may irritate asthma sufferers.

The preseason part of the study
was conducted last fall and showed
that even severe asthma patients,
such as freshman Joe Stone, had a
high lung capacity. The postseason
part of the study will take part in
late April, and Ashmen is excited to
see the differences in the two mea-

V surements of each swimmer.

Exercise induces asthma attacks
in some patients by causing the tiny
muscles surrounding bronchials to
twitch, thus restricting air flow. The
problem is made worse by cold, dry
air —— that is why the moist, humid
air around a pool is helpful for an
asthma patient.

Many Olympic swimmers have
competed and won gold medals
while suffering from asthma.

today are much
better than the
mediocre drugs
from 25 years
ago.”

According to
Calhoun, the
key issues for
today’s asthmat-
ic athletes are receiving the correct
diagnosis and getting the right
treatment.

Many people believe they have
asthma, but never see a doctor to

receive a diagnosis, said the doctor. .
These people, in turn,‘ purchase ‘

over—the-counter inhalers that can
essentially do more harm than good.

“Most of the time the OTC
inhalers wouldn’t be a problem,”
Calhoun said. “But there are some

times when a prescription drug can .

help immensely.”

One of the major classes of
asthma medications, according to
Calhoun, is steroidal anti-inﬂam-
matories. These drugs are entirely
different from the anabolic steroids
that have become notorious for
their abuse by athletes, rather they
prevent attacks before their onset
by reducing the swelling around the
windpipe and reducing the produc-
tion of mucus.

Such steroid-based medications
can be a part of daily life for ath-
letes like Stone, who uses three
inhalers, each holding a different
medicinal concoction. While he
tries to use these devices as little as
possible, he often needs the medica-
tion for swimming practices or even
classes -——- which he occasionally
misses due to his illness.

“All my teachers have been
more than understanding,” Stone

said. “They’ve had to adjust their ,
own schedules to accommodate me. 

I appreciate that.”

NL

contend.

4. Florida Marlins. Don’t confuse
these ﬁsh with the ones that bought a
World Series title last year. Once again
the Marlins resemble an expansion team,
after they got rid of 12 of the 25 members
of their World Series winning team. That
leaves a lot of question marks. Rumor has
it that owner Wayne Huizenga even tried
to sell his dog Toto to the highest bidder.

5. Philadelphia Phillies. The question
surrounding this team is not how many
games the Phils will win this year, but
rather, how many they will lose. Yes, they
had the best record after the All-Star
game last season, and Ctut Schilling is
arguably the best stiikeout pitcher in the
game. Schilling will have three times as
many strikeouts as the Phillies do wins.

WEST

1. Los Angeles Dodgers. The United
Nations Nine (a.k.a. the Dodgers) boast
players from Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, Japan and Korea on their ros-
ter. While this may make clubhouse con-
versations awkward, the Dodgers have
the most stacked lineup in the league.
This year may be starting pitchers Ismael
Valdes and Chan Ho Park’s coming-out
season. Closer Todd Worrell retired, but
ﬁreballer Antonio Osuna should be an
adequate replacement Mike Piazza and
Raul Mondesi lead an offense that should
be second only to the Rockies.

2. San Diego Padres. The Padres
have one of the most top-to-bottom solid
lineups in the league. The addition of

THE PITT NEWS

pitching stud Kevin Brown (traded to the
Padres after the Marlins post—World
Series purge) adds to an already intimi-
dating starting rotation. Their offense is
full of veterans such as Tony Gwynn,
Ken Caminiti and Wally Joyner who pro-
vide equally solid offense and defense.
Expect the Padres to make a run at the
NL West crown and at the very least,
secure a wild card

3. Colorado Rockies. Pitcher Darryl
Kile had a career year for the Astros last
season in the pitcher-friendly Astrodome.
Then he signed with the Rockies, moving
into Coors Field, the best hitter’s park in
baseball. Bad move, Darryl. The
Rockies’ oﬁensive ﬁrepower, led by NL
MVP Larry Walker, Dante Bichette and
Vinny Castilla, is impressive. But their
weak pitching staff, combined with the
thin Denver air, will yield a lot of 14-11
games.

4. San Francisco Giants. The Giants
won over 90 games last season and held
off the Dodgers to win the West. But the
team from the Bay lost closer Rod Beck
and mid—season acquisitions Wilson
Alvarez and Roberto Hernandez, who
fueled their pennant run. Several players,
including Jeff Kent and Sean Estes, will
have a diﬂicult time duplicating their
1997 stats. Of course, the Giants still
have everybody’s favorite left ﬁelder,
Barry Bonds.

5. Arizona Diamondbacks. The
Diamondbacks made a bold move for an
expansion team, spending millions of
dollars signing veteran free agents Jay
“Boo” Bell and Matt Williams. They’ll
still suck.

And it’s the only sport where a 1-0
shutout is the most exciting game.

Fans have waited more than ﬁve
and a half months to see real baseball.
The past month has been merely a
primer for what lies ahead.

Spring training was the time to dust
off the cobwebs after a lethargic winter
and make sure all the working parts are
still functioning. The games are essen-
tially meaningless, played in front of
small, retirement-community crowds
with nothing really at stake (save for the
38-year-old utility inﬁelder giving it one
more chance to make the big leagues).

But Opening Day is the real thing,
the time when players actually begin
running out ﬂy balls and the games real-

13

 

ly count in the standings. No more
seven-inning, split-squad games called
because of darkness, and no more
chances to use 12 pitchers in one game.

In many ways, spring training is
like a big tease, kind of like a red Jelly-
Belly. You save the red for last, hoping
it’s a cherry or maybe evena fruit punch
candy tlLat’s waiting to satisfy your taste
buds at the bottom of the bag., only to be
disappointed and alarmed when you bite
down on a double hot cirmamon. 7

Beginning tomorrow, all the disap-
pointments are over. Now, it’s time for
the real thing.

Ned Schano is the senior staﬁ writer for
The Pitt News and has been hibernating
for the last ﬁve months in anticipation of
the ﬁrst no-hitter:

 FROM PAGE 10

Dana Jafarian and Erin Shalbrack, along
with Davis and Bucher, fell to their
Mountaineer rivals.

Jafarian’s loss was the most painful,
as she dropped a 6-0, 6-0 match to
Christina Walker.

“She’s a national top 45 [player],’’
Dieffenbach said of Walker. “She could
be a world-class player when she gradu-
ates. I’m talking top 100 in the world.

“There are a lot of tennis players in
the world.”

Jafarian, a freshman, fell to 11-15
after her two Saturday losses, including
her defeat at the hands of Walker, a senior.

The Panthers» hope to recover this

afternoon, taking on St. Bonaventure at
the Cost Center at 3 p.m.. According to
Dieffenbach, the Bonnies will provide a
less formidable challenge than Saturday’s
opposition. Pitt downed St. Bonaventure,
5-4, in each of the last two seasons.

“I don’t think they’re as strong as
they were last year,” Dieffenbach said.

The match also marks a chance for
Davis to pull even closer to the all-time
Panther wins mark (both singles and dou-
bles), currently held by Julie LoPrinzi
with 116 victories. Davis had 113 wins
entering Saturday’s contest and takes that
number with her into today’s match.

If she wins both her singles and dou-
bles matches this afternoon, she’ll have a
chance to tie and break the record April 7
versus Duquesne.
