New Additions
Aid Student
Health Plan

In addition toits regular stu-
dent health services for minor_ill-
nesses «and injuries incurred dur-
ing‘ school hours, the University
this year oﬁers a new hospitaliza-
tion plan for students, operated
in conjunction with the Employ-
ers Liability Assurance Corpora-
tion, Ltd’. A‘ The plan provides
treatment for illnesses or injur-
ies requiring hospital or emer-
gency hospital care when the
campus services are not available.

For an annual premium of $10
for out-of-town students or $5
for students living in the city,
the insurance guarantees up to
$500 reimbursement for each in-
jury or illness incurred. Individu-
al costs, covered include the fol-
lowing: Hospital board and care,
$6.50 per day; additional special
services, such as X-‘rays, oper-
ating room expenses, etc., $65;
surgery, a graduated scale rang-
ing up to $150; physician’s ser-
vices, $3 per visit to hospital up
to $75 ;and dentistry, $100 for
treatment resulting from injury
to sound, natural teeth.

A special provision of the poli-
cy makes beneﬁts payable in ad-
dition to any which a student
may be entitled to under any per-
sonal policy or hospitalization as-
s-ociation.

Pamphlets listing information
for enrolling ‘under this plan are
secured at the registration areas
at Syria Mosque and Ellsworth
center, or at the University’s Stu-
dent Health Service.

If October’s social events are a preview of this year's calendar,
.,»‘the' Pitt campus will be a busy one.

VA Increases
Subsistence
Credit Limits

Veterans’ Administration. of-
ficials recently set ‘a 14-credit
minimum for undergraduate stu-
dent veterans seeking full time
subsistence, This requirement
goes into effect this semester.

Revised qualiﬁcations for par-
tial subsistence are included in"
the same measure. "'

The new policy, designed to
bring VA prerequisites more in-
to line with regular college stand-
ards for full-time participation,
affects aproximately 30-00 Pitt
veterans carrying only 12 credits,
the minimum during the spring
semester.

J; Edward Ricart, Director of
Veterans Affairs at Pitt, urges all
students who attend school under

beneﬁts of the GI Bill, to make

the necessary readjustments in
their proposed curricula imme-
idately. ,_ -

University officials may not be
geared to absorb a last minute
rush for several thousand extra

courses. Any veteran waiting too
long before complying with the
order may be unable to secure ex-
tra credits and consequently not
receive full subsistence pay.

Part-time students are class-

iﬁed according to the following‘

schedule:

(1) 11-13 credits equal 3,5; sub-
sistence.

(2) 7-10 credits equals 1/2 sub-
sistence.

(3) 4-7 credits equals 1/4 sub-
esistnce.

Students carrying four cred-
its or less are eligible to receive
only tuition and supplies, at the
rate of 1/4 of their tuition allot-
ments. They are not eligible for
any subsistence.

These changes apply exclusive-
ly to undergraduate student vet-
erans. The 12-credit minimum
still holds for graduate students.

 ctobernates Set for Two Dances

The Soph Hop on October 17 is
still in a tentative stage. The po-
sitions of business manager and
chairman are open. Sophomores
are requested to apply at the office
of the dean of men before Sept.
24.

As soon as all applications are
in, the Appointments Committee
of Student Congress, headed by
Janet Neesham, will meet to
choose the business manager and
chairman.

Hagan Promises to Provide

Space for All at Stadium

Student interest in athletics this summer resulted in an
August meeting between Athletic Director James Hagan and a
committee representing the student body. Student concern also
brought assurance of the Chancelor’s interest regarding at-
tempted improvements in the sporting set-up. ' e .

Last ‘years traffic jam in the student section at Pitt home
games should be only a bad memory this season. Following his

James Hagan
“Room for all.”

New System
Accelerates
Registration

Three days of registration un-
der the new modiﬁed pre—registra-
tion system have demonstrated the
University’s stated policy to do
the most it canfor the greatest
number of students.

Unlike last September’s regis-
tration, the current procedure
eliminates much of the confusion
and most of the long lines at Syria
Mosque necessitated in the past
by faculty advisors selecting
courses f‘or students.

Seniors and juniors, registering
Friday and Monday required
from 25 minutes to several hours
to complete their registrations, de-
pending upon the time consumed
in arranging a schedule for them-
selves without conflicts.

Under the new system, compos-
ite time schedules of classes for
the fall semester along with study
lists were sent to all undergradu-
ate students except engineers who
follow block schedules arranged
by their department. The student
chose his own schedule in advance,
ﬁlled out his study list and receiv-
ed his advisor’s approval.

Students reported to the Mosque
at times indicated on the back of
their study lists.

Veteran students attending
school under beneﬁts of the GI
Bill found the red tape ordinar-
ily accompanying their registra-
tion had been cut considerably and
that in certain cases they could
ﬁll out the necessary forms in as
little as 15 minutes.

Some senior engineers received
registration permits for Friday
morning by special delivery mail
late Thursday night. The permits
were postmarked 8 p. m. Thurs-
day.

News Seeks
Staff Members

The Pitt News needs men" and
women to handle the various jobs
of publishing a twice—week1y,
eight page newspaper.

Openings exist on the news, fea-
ture, copy, and sports desks. A
librarian, an exchange editor, two
society columnists, a humor col-
umnist, and several special assign-
ment editorialists are needed.

Anyone intenested may inquire
at the News Office, 825 Cl, Thurs-
day or Friday afternoon of this

   

‘impeossible for the girls.

  

meeting with the students, Hagan
announced that arrangements are
completed for a new seating sys-
tem. _

The other tentative addition to
the sports organization on cam-
pus is the possible appointment
of a student representative to the
University committee on athletics.

Chancellor Gets Ball Rolling

The door for this plan was
openedby a letter from the Chan-
cellor replying to this request
made by students last spring. Dr.
Fitzgerald asked that a commit-

-‘ tee from Student Congress meet

with him this fall to discuss the
subject.

Deﬁnite plans for the new seat-
ing arrangements call for a stu-
dent cheering section and demon-
stration block for home football
games.

Percentage Scheme Originated

The size of the enlarged student
section will be determined on a
percentage basis. For example.
last season 8000 student activity
cards were issued. If the top stu-
dent attendance at at single game
was 6000——the percentage was
75 per cent. Therefore, seats in
the student section this fall would
toftal~‘75 per’ cent of the number
of activity cards issued at regis-
tration.

In anticipation of the large turn-
out for the opener with Notre
Dame, six student sections may
be reserved.

It is expected that 900 seats
in Section 17--on the 50-yard line
—will be used for the demonstra-
tion block. After a thorough trial,
Student Congress purchased a
public address system composed
of two portable electric mega-
phones.

The PA system will be used in
both the demonstration block and
the cheering section. Swimming
Coach Ben Grady, who qualiﬁes
as an expert on demonstration
block technique, will handle the
block. He 11S0 will instruct the
cheer leaders.

Hagan guaranteed further that
every effort will be made to seat
all students who wish to attend
home games. He emphasized that
in all probability, more student
seats would _be allotted than
would be needed.

Comrﬁittfe members who repre-
sented (the, student body at the
meetingwith the Athletic Direc-
tor, include: Walt Thompson,
Jack Moran, ‘Ch‘a1'les Davis and
Franklin _Blacl§s_'t_U3ne.

N 0 Dictation, Please

It is rare that a statement of policy should
appear in the registration edition. It is very
rare that such a statement is needed.

During the two—day work run on this e'di-
tion, itbecame evident that some statement
should be made. On two particular instances,
the News was instructed, forcefully, what to
print and when to ‘print it. It also was in-
structed to provide an individual with rights
of censorship. .

In deference to these persons, whose knowl-
edge of journalism is scant, and to the fact
that we had made no previous declaration of
policy, we followed, to a limited extent, their
directions. -

As a matter of policy, beginningnext Tues-
day, we ask for cooperation from all offices-
administrative, faculty, student——in providing

' information to print in the Pitt News. Under

all circumstances, printing certain releases is
worthwhile for the student body, as publicity
to the outside and to the ofﬁces themselves. \Ve
realize our position’in this respect.

In the same breath, we must insist that the
News will not be an announcement sheet, dedi-
cated to the whims of those seeking publicity.

A college newspaper serves to train its per-
sonnel in ways -similar to actual commercial
paper operation. There is no independent news-
paper in the nation which follows the “print
what I dictate” principle.

The second. point of policy concerns censor-
ship. Part of the training involved in the News
is a major point not covered extensively in any
journalism course. Newspaper ethics and ac-
curacy are just as important here as in any
commercial publication. If the reporter must
have the news source check every word that he
writes, his training in accuracy and ethics suf-
fers. .

We keep a record of each reporter and each
article that he writes. We rely on his accuracy,
honor, and, judgment. If there is any error in
copy, .a cheek-back can be made.

We ask then for cooperation—with the lim-
itations of our position as an independent news-

paper.

Reverse Irish

The month of August was_ warm, humid,
and, at times, rainy. A direct contrast with
the month of June.

Student Congress found also that the summer
was divided into two parts. One of cold indif-
ference, the other, warm - - even torrid interest
- - on the part of James Hagan, ‘Director of Ath-
letics. ‘

Late’ spring of last year saw a letter ad-
dressed to the athletic head asking for an
answer to certain problems confronting the stu-
dent body and its football games. Little if any-
thing resulted immediately. A letter was ad-
dressed to the Chancellor asking, in eifect, the
same thing.

The two Congress notes wanted:

(1) More seating for the student body at
football games; _

. (2) Permission tbiuse a loud speaker system
to aid the cheeringvblock and cheerleaders.

During the mo:_1th~of August, the athletic

I office and Mr. Hagan replied. And their reply

far surpassed~ Congress’ expectations.

A seatingar-rangerxient has been worked out
and presente,d“:by ,_Mr.-p Hagan. The cheering
block has a sct.,of electric megaphones, far su-
perior to a B «A system in simplicity and por-
tability.  '‘...''Q. .

The announcement" that the administration
is consideringjthe appointment of a student
"member to the'~UI1iye;t'.sity Committee on Ath-
1613108 aS’C011nd’.e'd' Congress. It marks the great-
est step .in the directionfof progress for the or-
dinarily impotent Student governing body.

Pitt departs "from usual role of watching
before acting,-'m',if 'it'«accepts the suggestion.
It has been tried, bt”1'1;__'7tl1e results of the move
are incomplete." Thevmove is still relatively
new. It smacks of the unconventional. And
for Pitt, this is a great: step forward.

, We look forward to the fall meetings of the
committees and of Congress. Whether a suit-
able arrangement can be made concerning the
student appointment or not, a pat on the back
should go to last year’s student body alienator,

. James Hagan.

Piﬂ iNews Reprint:

The following editorial appeared in the Washington and Jefferson
College newspaper last May. It is reprinted herein accord with the
Pitt News staff policy to keep its readers informed about ideas and
attitudes represented at other colleges and universities.

Grades and Ratings

Many of us associate-—not always consciously-,—grades or
marks given scholastic eﬁorts with army grades and commercial
ratings. Students may even ask instructors “What’s it worth?” in
reference to a paper. That question is ordinarily used in connec-
tion with price. In other words, the student asks the instructor
“What price will you give me?” In the back of his mind is per-
haps the thought that in the commercial world an “A student” or a

“B student” appropriately gets better jobs and more money. If that
is true, a student who receives an F is immediately branded a failure,
he who receives a D rides to fall, and the "‘C student’f is condemned
to mediocrity. , _

A college in primary ‘deﬁnition is a. community of scholars.
All the scholars have a common interest in learning. The senior
scholars, as they seek new truths, communicate the truths they
have learned to their juniors. There is no end to the process of
learning. Discovery of new truths reveals new unknowns. Learn?-"’
ing like living, is a continuous self-renewing activity. It only
dies with the man. If it dies before him, he is intellectually dead. '

A college is not a market. Barter and prices are alien to it. Any
achievement is a landing place in the ascent; new doors remain to be
opened. A college is not a trade school. Its purpose is not to teach
how—except how to 1ear~n——but what. Grading systems are imperfect
devices designed to measure progress in academic life. They are an
arbitrary means by which the senior scholars attempt to estimate
the readiness of their juniors to embark on further ventures. ‘In.
some cases they represent critical appraisals of performances. Still
they are expressiong of opinion that may be useful to the student.

A Phi Beta Kappa key looks well on a watch-chain. Watch-
chains, however, are not worn much today. In any case,ithe emblem.
of the honorary society is just that. Physically, it is an ornament. It
is not a symbol, like the “Key to the city,” of popular acclaim; nor
is it a “key to success” in any world except, ‘perhaps, the academic
world. If the four-year “B student” or the three—year “A student” is
rewarded for his brilliance or his industry, the prize is simply the
opportunity to learn a little more a little sooner. "

Life does not end at the gate" of the college or the door
of the classroom, Years ago the venerable president of the Uni-
versity of Chicago, the late Harry Pratt Judson, greeted freshmen
with the good counsel that they were there not preparing for
life but living it. Learning is part of the living of a civilized man. ‘
It should be integrated with whatever joys and sorrows his daily
life contains. How often have you not smiled with pleasure when

you said, “I didn’t know that”?

The shock of recognition and the triumph of discovery are terms
familiar to psychologists. “Eureka!” is the word come to us from
‘Archimedes. It was not the gold that excited him; it was the dis-
covery. The Greeks had a word-—philosophy-—for their love of learn-
ing. Our neglect of their gift is what-— Walter Lippman deplores, among
other things, in an essay called “Education without Culture,” included
in our Freshman reading course. Pessimistically, he sees an educa-
tional system that has forsaken its classical heritage and “which
sharpens the acquisitive and domineering and possessive instincts.”
He-‘blames the taxpayers, parents of students, for pressing the schools
and colleges to abandon western culture for careerist training.

There are, of course, the professional schools or colleges that
serve society with doctors, lawyers and engineers. But the best
of those institutions require the new student to bring something
more than interest, aptitude or ambition. They expect him to
understand what he reads or what he hears. They expect him to
have some acquaintance with literature and the arts as well as
with science. They expect him to be able to use independently
his independent mind, to have some knowledge of his world and
of society. They expect him even to have begun to understand
himself, .

Self-discovery can be as rewarding as the discovery of external
truths. A student who does not experience spiritual and mental
growth, who does not ﬁnd new talents and capacities and new ways
of looking at life through his undergraduate years, is a man who in-
sulates himseli.‘ against fortune anddenies himself freedom. His pur-
suit of learning becomes a weary trudge from course to course. He
dwells in darkness because he closes his eyes against the light, sadly
hoping that some day he’ll be given the paper that says he’s served
his time. -

Go Hand-in-Hand ‘

by Bill Veenis .

Every year, every editor in every school in ,
the country tells Mr. and Miss Frosh: “Join I
the happy throng, kids. You ’re in college now; i
this is life - - the real thing - - get in there and
pitch . . . ” and so-'o—o—on.

Every year, every upperclassman in every
school in the country remarks bf the editor:
“You meathead!”

Mr. and Miss Frosh will be fed more ﬂow- ,
ery phrases and insipid inducements during the ’
next few weeks than a smoothgent on a moon-
light night could produce. For a change they
won’t swallow everything, On the contrary,
probably nothing. Mr. Frosh hasmaturity in
experience and years, with his femme counter
soon adopting his opinions. ‘ .

Mr. Frosh is mature. His reaction to most,
things collegiate, unless they have a deﬁnite
bearing on his life plan, is “childish, a waste‘
of time.” Basically, he’s right. A considerable
the title of tradition or sentiment takes a
strong stomach on the part of the practical ob-
server. And Mr. Frosh, a veteran, is that.

The one flaw in this much publicized matur-
ity of Mr. Frosh is evident to everyone but
himself. After a few short weeks, the_pure
cynic emerges. Mr. Frosh degenerates into a
grousing nonenity.

The ofﬁces of the dean of men and women
are more than a little perturbed over this “col-
lege life isn’t my speed” attitude. Higher_edu-
cation is relegated to technical training when
it attempts to work. through this cynicism. (Mr. ,
Frosh calls it mature individualism.) And the 
deans are worried. A .5

Freshman camp, along with its many facets :
of enjoyment, tries to ,tell the freshman what I

_to look for and what to expect in the way of a 

modiﬁed campus life. It explaiiis that more ,
than a sheepskin can be gained through edu- ii
cation. Under all of this lies the bare fact that
college is what the individual student wants it
to be.

Mr. Frosh, our new cynic, fails to see that
he, as an individual, is obtaining an education.-
In this he also misses the fact that hisxbuddy
is doing the same thing. Hence, Mr; Frosh deals’

PK um, _ '

nothing but black cards when it comes to com-

menting on his college life. _

Whether our individual freshman likeszac-
tivities, football games, Lantern "iNights,. or
Freshman Camp is his own concern. If he
wants to go to a school danceor to his favorite
spend and bend joint that is his concern '

Logically, whatever his buddy does ishis
buddy’s concern. But Mr. Frosh" doesn’t see it
that way. _ I ' ,

He now calls all school life unﬁt except for '
highschoolers. And classes all who delve into
it .as infants. Purely the opinion of the ego-
tistic cynic - - pardon, our “practical” Mr.
Frosh. ‘ V ,

In the end, our Mr. Frosh becomes Mr. 
Senior. He has led four years of a merry rat _ Z
race for grades, and little else. He condemns-
Pitt, or whatever school he attended, as .‘-‘too
formal.” And ends by saying, “I wouldn’t
permit my children to enter that school.”

And the upperclassmen remark‘ of ‘ the
editor: “You meathead.”

'“.“acks Ellsworth Center

Ellsworth Center, the latest ad-
dition to the University’s system
of schools, opens for registration
of freshman and transfer students
of sophomore standing tomorrow
and Thursday while work is be-
ing rushed to completion on class-
room and laboratory facilities for
use by opening day.

Admitting both veterans and

. recent high school graduates (all

male), the Center has been plan-
-ned and equipped to accomodate
1,000 students. Although the ma-

. jority of students will be first

semester freshmen, some trans-
fer students from western Penn-
sylvania Area College Centers al-
so will be admitted according to
Director Viers W. Adams.

‘The Center, located in the old
Shadyside Academy building at
Morewood and Ellsworth Avenues
(about a‘ mile from the Cathedral
campus), provides six laborator-
ies and 16 classrooms for elemen-

W ,tary work in the College, Busi-

i

ness Administration, and Engi-
neering and Mines.
Handles Cathedral Overﬂow
Similar in the scope of its ac-
tivities to the Johnstown Center,
the Ellsworth Center was con-
ceived and fostered by Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald to cope with
the unprecedented number of ap-
plicants for admission to the Uni-
versity and to better utilize the
Shadyside building. As a supple-
ment to the Cathedral campus
’ the building could not be well
used because of distance and time
required for travel between the
two locations.
Under the existing plan, Ells-
worth Center students will take
all of their classes at the Shady-

rside building _although they Will

be ‘considered students of the
University of Pittsburgh and may
participate in any extracurricular
activities at the main campus.
Completely, Independent Unit
Students admitted ‘to the Cen-
ter. will be those who could not

spective schools were ﬁlled. Each
school was allotted a ﬁxed num-

ber of students who might attend
the Cathedral campus and all in
excess of thatpnumber were as-
signed to the Ellsworth center.

An independent unit in all re-
spects save extracurricular activ-
ities———student demand will deter-
mine what activities the Center
will provide exclusively for Cen-
ter students—the Center is equip-
epd with a library containing
about 5-000 volumes, a branch of
the University bookstore and a
cafeteria seating 200 students.

Operating under the adminis-
trative supervision of the Uni-

Frosh Men Meet
Senior Advisor

Freshman men students meet 9

their upperclass counsellors at
the Dean of Men’s assembly this
afternoon at 1 o’clock in the S01-
diers and Sailors Memorial Hall
auditorium from 1 to 2:30 p. m.

Immediately after the assem-
bly, meetings of the counsellors
with their individual groups are
scheduled in classrooms at the
Cathedral. Approximately 20 stu-
dents will be assigned to each
group. _ \

Although there are possibly
only 40 counsellors, a four to six
weeks orientation program is to
be carried out. During this time,
the counsellors will meet week-
ly with heir groups and discuss
school activities and history of
the University.

This year’s orientation pro-
gram is not compulsory, but
Men’s‘Council would like to see
all freshmen men participate. No
customs exam is included in the
program. However, Panther keys
will be awarded on a different

basis, not yet decided.

the Ellsworth center at his ofﬁce on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

the term. .

The 51 senior mentors, chosen
because they best represent Pitt’s
ideal in womanhood, are slated to

By 1895, ten years after its

and a sizeable new building was
added to the old one. Morewood

 When the building was built, Morewood Avenue was not

been donated to the school by a
Pittsburgher. At Fox Chapel the
school has 125 acres with swim-

Pitt’s administrative hierarchy
is near full strength oncepmore
following the summertime ap-
pointment of ﬁve new officers, in-
cluding one dean and two "de-
partment heads.

-Dr. Lawrence E. Van Kirk, a
practicing dentist, was selected
as new dean of the School of
Dentistry; He succeeds Dr. F. C.
Friesell who has been acting dean
since the death of Dr. H. Edmund
Friesell.

Both the English and mechan-
ical engineering departments
start the year with new top men.
Dr. Putnam F. Jones takes’ over

the chairmanship of the English

department committee from Fred-
erick P. Mayer. Mayer resigned
this summer because of ‘ill
health. W. Lewis Buck, one time
W &g J engineering teacher, comes
here as head of the M. E. de-
partment.

To take care of the spiritual
side of campus life, Rev. Paul Of-
fenhifer was picked as campus
minister for Baptist students,
while Rev. J. Victor Murtland ad-
vanced from Part-to full-time
pastor to Lutheran students.
Neither post existed previously.

Still left unﬁlled are the va-
cancies created by the resigna-

_ tions of Elmer Holbrook, Dean
of the School of Engineering;_ Dr.
'William R. Farmer,

University
Chaplain; and Miss Marie Mc-
Swiggan, director of the Univer-

Camp Kon-O-Kwee, owned and
operated nearly all year around
by the YMCA of Pittsburgh, will
oﬁer the campers the finest type
of outdoor activities. Situated on
the Conoquennessing Creek, the
camp c-overs a large area in which
facilities for all activities are lo-

pool is one of the largest camp

' pools in this portion of the state,

and living and eating accommo-

The camp is recommended by
the entire University faculty and
staff. Dean of Men T. W. Biddle
observes, “As a participant in
every Freshman camp since the
ﬁrst one in 1930, I can enthusias-
ticallyencourage the attendance of
every freshman. The camp will
afford you a real experience. It
is a vital factor in Pitt life.”

The U. S.  Force now offers you the chance of a
lifetime to start your career in aviation.

If you want to learn to fly, you have one of the

' ﬁnest opportunities ever offered in peacetime. Avia-
tion Cadet pilot training has been reopened to quali-
ﬁed applicants presently serving enlistments in the
Army, and to civilian young men who can meet the

same high standards.

In order to be eligible, each applicant must Be: a
single male citizen, between 20 and 26% years old,
of excellent character and physically ﬁt. He must ,
have completed at least one half the credits leading to
a degree from an accredited college or university, or
be able to pass a mental examination given by the
USAF. He must now be living within the conti-

 

,, nental limits of the United States.

   

____ .4

Upon successful completion of the training course,
Cadets will be rated as pilots, commissioned Second
Lieutenants, and assigned to ﬂying duty.

Reactivation of Aviation Cadet pilot training is
only one of the several choices open to outstanding
men who want increased responsibility and advance-
ment in the ﬁeld of aviation. It is now possible for
qualiﬁed men to apply for attendance at USAF}
Ofﬁcer Candidate School —— and thus be able to equip
themselves for such important specialties as engi-
neering, armament, administration and supply.

You have a real chance to make progress and build
a sound career for yourself in today’s U. S. Air Force.
Talk it over with the Recruiting Olhcer today at

By Repairmen

From a broad new stone plaza
on the Fifth avenue entrance to
the heavy oak doors that replace
the hazardous revolving door at
State Hall, The University has
vast improved student facili-
ties during the summer. Since
early July, carpenters, cement
workers, plasters and painters
have completed ten classrooms in
the Cathedral. -

‘Laboratories have been added
in the New Ellsworth Center and
the biology lab on the tenth ﬂoor
of the Cathedral has been com-
pleted. On the ground ﬂoor, the
Physics department will seat its
students in two recently complet-
ed /rooms, G 8 and G 13.

The Nationality Rooms have
been cleaned and 2,300 square feet’
of flooring has been sanded and
re-varnished. Even the ﬁfth floor
libraries have been given a new
coat of paint, improving visibility.

The Blue Tuck Shop annex re-
ceived a new coat of paint and
there will soon be a hydraulic
elevator to speed food from the
basement to the kitchen. The
Red Tuck shop boasts a new elec-
tric dumbwaiter to carry food up
and dishes down. '

Modernization has also been
under way on the hill. In addi-
tion to a new Physical Chemistry
Lab in Alumni Hall, the Electric-
al Engineering Department has
been tearing down walls and re-
modeling.

Even the Stadium will have it’s
share of improvements when the
ﬁrst home game is broadcast from
a new press booth with large full
view windows. Back in the Ca-
thedral again. The Schenley Ball-
room is now ready for the inter-

_ior panel work and workmen are

now installing the limestone

arches at the entrance.
Steam mains have been install-
ed and are in operation in four

hospitals at the medical center. i

The steam plant located in Thaw

Hall will continue serving Thaw, "

State, the Dental Inﬁrmary,
Alumni Hall and the Falk School,

but'in case of failure, it will be  it

supplemented with s-team from
the new main.

Glenn S. Peacock, construction
engineer for the University, stat-
ed that “plastering will continue
in classrooms by shifting classes
to continue the work.”

A tour of the ground and the
ﬁrst three ﬂoors disclosed forty-
eight rooms, which Mr. Peacock
and the University construction
crews have yet to complete. '

Weiss to Direct‘

Mixed Chorus

Pitt Singers, latest musical
group added to Pitt activities,
makes its debut this fall. The
new group is a chorus of mixed
voices drawn from Men’s Glee
Club and Women’s Choral.

David Weiss, head of both the
Men’s Glee Club and Women’s
Choral, will choose 32 members
of the chorus from these groups.
Self-government for the group

will be provided by elected stu- -

dent officers. Meetings are sched-

to 12:30 p. m.

Certain to See

If Athletic Director James Ha-
gan had his way, Pitt would meet
Notre Dame twice on October 4-
once in the morning, again in the
afternoon. That way, he ﬁgures
half of the people who want to
see this game could squeeze into
the Stadium.

Sounds like one of Brooklyn’s
double admission twin bills. As
it stands the Notre Dame game is
a sure sellout, 65,000. Already the
Athletic Department is considering
the erection of temporary stands
for this grid battle. e

“Speaking conservatively,” Ha-
gan said, “250,000 people would
buy a ticket for that ball game,
if we had enough seats.” A mul-
titude that size would jam Sol-
diers’ Field, Chicago, twice.

Irish Draw Crowds

Naturally, with the Irish already
being considered “in” as the No.
1 “’college‘”eleven in the country,
the Pitt-Notre Dame fray will be
the top “interest” game of the
four at the Stadium this fall;

However, large crowds will be
on hand for the Ohio State, Penn
State, and West Virginia tussels.
In fact, the advanced sale for
these games is the heaviest the
Pitt Athletic Department can re-
member.

The return of record—breaking
gates at Pitt can possibly be at-
tributed to two recent football
changes at the University.

Like Old Times

There is no doubt that the ﬁght-
ing ball club that Wes Fesler
ﬁelded last fall gained many ad-
mirers. Then, too, Mike Milli-
gan reverting back to the single
wing offense, the Sutherland sys-
tem that put Pitt on’ top in the
’30’s, probably -has the fans rem-
iniscing and looking forward.

Those war-time struggles
against Temple or Bucknell in
front of naked Stadium seats are
From
now on, a crowd of 25,000 will be
classiﬁed “minute.”

End Two-week
a  Drill Period  
 ”  .  Ai Bedford

Mike Milligan brings his 51_
gridders back to campus tomorrow
for a seven-day tuneup in prep-
aration for the opener with Illinois
at Champaign. After two weeks of
hard work at Bedford’s Arandale
Golf club, here’s the picture.

Milligan’s line
needs m o r e
depth. With a
few exceptions,
the r e s e r V e

linemen lack
game experi-
e n c e . Like

 

every, coach in
the country—ex-
eluding Notre
Dame’s Frank Leahy —— Milligan it
needs tackles. The temporary loss
of Wib Forsythe, who wasin the A
Mercy hospital for a physical
chec-k-up, upset previous plans.

Forsythe was expected to pair
with last year’s regular tackle, Bob
Plotz. But a throat infection
coupled with a 25 pound loss in
Weight has sidelined Wib. To ﬁll
the Void Walt Cummins has been
switched to tackle where he joins
Mike Boldin, Moe Harris, Don
Karanovich, and Ralph Coleman.

It’s the third shift for Cummins
who ran at quarterback during
spring drill and shifted back to
end this fall. The two Bills, Mc-
Peak and Mihm, are one, two at .
right end, while Ted Geremski
moved up to second string behind
Leo Skladany at the left terminal.

Three Deep at Center

Len Radnor has strengthened.-
his claim to the ﬁrst team center
job that he won during spring -
training. But Lee Ward—out since .;
the Notre Dame tilt with a knee 5
injury—has come back fast. Once
Sam Haddad’s shoulder separa-
'tion_ mends, the centers will be
three deep.

At the guards, last year’s regu-~
lars, Bernie Barkouskie and John .
Kosh, dominate a ﬁeld which in-
cludes: Earl Sumpter, Bill Coury,
Tony Razzano, and George John-
osn. Sumpter has been outstand-
ing on defense. ,

The big problem in the back-
ﬁeld is what to do with ‘Sleepy’
Paul Rickards. Just watching
Rickards on defense can tire any-
one. He won’t‘run two feet to
make a tackle—not when he can
jog. When he carries the ball, he
lumbers. ' 1

Just Wants To Pass

Any individual, group, or team_
in the University can compete in
intramural athletics. The only
restriction prevents teams from
using letter winners in that par-
ticular sport.

The bowling schedule gets un-
der way soon after the start of the
fall term. As in the past,‘ IM
duckpin tumbling matches will

   

be held at the University Bowling ,
Alleys on Craig street. Both the joildeglorlllteof till:

Within the next week, Bemis ut a doubt ‘
will call a meeting of all sports .-Could be the ’bes
managers to make necessary ar- passer in Pitt

rangements for the inauguration
of the year’s program.

Bemis expresses the opinion,
“The scope of the entire intra-
mural program will be enlarged
this year. We honestly hope that
the’ student body takes as real in-
terest in IM activities.”

, Sherman, you will remember,
Went to fall camp last season with

‘Wes Fesler’s squad. He combined
fastrunning with deadly left-hand
passes, while his punting was out-
standing. Without a doubt, young
Sherman was the best backﬁeld
prospect on the squad.

‘Beforeschool started, Sherman
was drafted. After ﬁnishing a year
in the army and receiving his dis-

Wchare, he was contacted by Pitt

authorities. Sherman assured them
he was returning to Pitt.

Later, he reversed himself and
said he was undecided. Backﬁeld
Coach Josh Williams saw Sherman
late in August. Sherman once again-
promised to return to Pitt. The
odd part of it all is that Sherman
intended to enter as a pre-med.

Few, indeed, are the universi-
ties which can match the medical
facilities availa-

Byrne Boqk Settles Arguments

Those of you who had trouble
last season winning a tuck shop
football argument can look for-
ward to a few victories this sea-
son by securing a copy of Ray
Byrne’s “57 Years On Pittsburgh
Gridirons.”

Mr. Byrne writes occasional ar-
ticles for “Sportweek,” “Football
News,” “Huddle,” and the “Sport-
ing News.” He also compiled the
statistics and edited the football
section of Frank Menke’s forth-
coming “Revised Encyclopedia of
Sports.”

" In his thirty—six page pocket-
size history, he presents the ideal
argument settler. In it are found
most of the answers to questions
concerning the football destinies
of Pitt, Tech, Duquesne, and the
Steelers.

If you have a mania for all-
time teams, all-Americans, or
game-by-game season’s histories,
this is your meat. Just drop fifty
cents in anenvelope and mail to
Ray Byrne, P. O. Box 5139, Pitts-
burgh 6, Pa.

Crickets Buzz

At Fall Camp

If the Panthers were after a
training site that would permit
them to lend their concentration
solely to football, they picked a
perfect spot.

Situated one mile from Bed-
ford, the Arandale Golf Club cov-
ers a vast stretch of green land
sprawled in a valley of the Alle-
ghenies.

Aside from the coaches and the
signal-barkers, the only sounds
are the breeze rustling éhrough
the trees and the never-ending
buzz of crickets. By way of adapt-
ing themselves to the tranquil
surroundings, visitors go about
conversing in hushed whispers.

Young‘Doc Cuts Up

About the only excitement is
“young” Doc Carlson turning up
at the golf course with a terrify-
ing war cry. His -- ,~
antics could re- I

or a bird taking

New Shoes Cause Blisters

Injuries prevent Coach Milli-
gan from keeping his ﬁrst team
intact. The squad was outﬁtted
with 72 pairs of new shoes which
caused an epidemic of foot blis-
ters.

Ailing shoulders have troubled
Sam Haddad, guard Fred Cimino,
and halfback Jimmy Joe Robin-
son. Major ills were incurred by
halfback Bill Abraham, out with
a bad knee, and blocking back
John LaFrankie who has a brok-
en hand. Neither is expected to
play in the Illinois opener.

Mike‘: Hungry

Athletes Keep

Four Cooks Hustling All Day

By Donald Giﬂin

They don’t get paid time-and-a-half for overtime, but four,
and sometimes ﬁve, cooks work at least 16 hours a day in the Aran-

dale Golf Club kitchen preparing
and the coaches staying there.

meals for the 51 Pitt Panthers

Does this hard work phase these ladies? In direct contrast, Mrs.
Suter, the kitchen commander-in-chief, commented: “We're having

a lot of fun, feeding the boys.”
And feed them, they do_ With

steak’ and roast beef topping the

list, the hungry Pitt gridders devour more than 30 pounds of meat
at their noon and evening meals. This, they wash down with milk,

iced tea, and their favorite beverage——fruit punch. The milk went

down at a pint a person per meal

Panthers Go for Corn-on-the-Cob¢

Plums, grapes, and their fellow
fruits disappeared fast from the
training tables — in fact, so fast
that the waiters soon began to
hand the fruit out at theldoor so
that all the boys would get some.

Pudding and ice cream was
spoken of in gallons, rather than
in “minute” pints and quarts.
When these commodities were on
the bill of fare, ﬁve gallons barely
made the rounds.

Even though they didn’t go for
the country eggs in a particularly
big way, the Panthers certainly
liked Bedford’s corn—on-the-cob,
eating ten to ﬁfteen dozen ears at
a sitting.

Besides serving the food, the

stantly kept busy switching the
chairs at the three training tables,
one for the “thin” men, one for
the “fat” men, the other for the
coaches. There are no “just-
rights.”
Moe Harris Eats Light

Every day, a few of the over-
weights become underweights.
Then, the chair-shifting begins.
At least one fellow has remained
at the same table during the
training period, “tiny” — 240
pounds —- Moe Harris. He‘ just
can’t get away from the fat men’s
board. -

The meal schedule calls for
breakfast at 7:15 a. m., lunch at
12 noon, and dinner at 5:45.
Sometimes a long scrimmage dis-
rupts the routine.
