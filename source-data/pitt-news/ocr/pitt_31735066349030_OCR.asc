The Student Government (SG)
Allocations. Committee already may
have overspcnt its 1975-76 budget.
a spokesperson for the committee
said last night.

Though the year's total budget
for student groups has not yet been
accounted for, funding of organiza-
tional projects probably has gone
$1,000 beyond the maximum
amount SG will garner, according
to Allocations Committee member

"Patty Cooper.

“The most money we could bring
in this year would be $296,000,'' a
Cooper said, “and we've already
allocated $297,000‘ to organiza-
tions."

So far, Cooper said, about
$233,000 has been brought in to
cover expenses. .

 

  _' =3

The allocations funds, which
come from the $12 student
activities fee charged on student
invoices, are at the current level
because more than 2500 students
have not yet paid their bills,
according to Cooper.

Cooper cited other reasons for
the possible debt.

"We're not getting money back

"from student organizations like we

did in years past," she said. “The
Programming Committee (of SG)
and the Pitt News are operating
under new plans this year; we're
not getting returns from them."
Cooper explained that Program-
ming now receives only enough
money to pay for the cost of events
it brings in. To determine the
original funding, Allocations auto-
matically subtracts the estimated
ticket-sale proﬁt from the sum

Southern Leader$ays I
Faith Will CurePoverty

BY GARY LAMPENFELD '

_.;The power of Christian faith can
halt the cycle of black poverty and
oppression in the South, a Southern
religious leader said Wednesday at
the Belleﬁeld Presbyterian Church.

John Perkins, founder and
president of the Voice of Cavalry
Bible Institute in Mendenhall,
Mississippi, ‘said his organization
‘tries tolprepare black leaders for
educational, economic and political
advancement of rural black com-
munities by serving as Christian
models.

' Perkins is scheduled to address
the Black Action Society next
Wednesday.

“America is a leadership soc-
iety,” Perkins said, “and this is
reflected in the high esteem a
church places in its leader, the
minister."\. (He added, however,

A that the black minister “often got
‘caught up in his own wealth,” and
thus alienated himself from his
congregation. *

The focusgof the program atvthe

  
 

Bible Institute, according to Per-
kins, is on training community
leaders who can relate to their local
people in a Christian context. One
aspect of this leadership is the
teaching of agricultural manage-
ment techniques that are efﬁcient
and productive.

“Many (farm) co-ops
because they were run by persons
lacking in managerial know-how,”
Perkins said. “The (Black)
Muslims succeeded economically
because of their deep religious
conviction."

Perkins stressed that problems
of rural blacks in the South stem
from governmental indifference
toward education and welfare. An
example he cited is the lack of

_compulsory education laws in
Mississippi, and the state govern-
ment's attitude that welfare and
subsidized medical care would
foster laziness in black people.

Another cause of black oppres-
sion in the South, in Perkins’ view,
is the feeling by low-income whites
that they are superior to their_b1_ack
counterparts.

Programming needs.

Previously. Programming was
given lump sums to cover‘all costs
of events and was required to
return leftover funds at the end of
the year. .

Under a plan adopted this
summer, the Pitt News receives SG
allocation at a yearly rate of 8% of
the entire student activities bud-
get. Prior to this year, the paper
also was required to return the
unspent
budget at the end of the ﬁscal year.

Cooper also said the current

inflation rate has caused an
increase in the number of
emergency funding requests by
campus groups.

“We also projected a very
optimistic enrollment for this
year," Cooper said. “but enroll-
ment went down and we haven't
brought in a lot of money."

Fifty-one thousand dollars was
left over from last year's budget,
according to SG Board President
Larry Platt, but $38,000 of that
amount has been used to pay off

51' Udents Support ‘Tiger Paul’ i

BY TOM WENSTON
_ An overwhelming majority of Pitt
students say “Tiger Paul" Aus-
lander should be allowed to
continue cheerleading at Pitt
basketball games, according ‘to a
Pitt News survey taken this
weekend.

Of 100 students polled, 71 said
they believed Auslander was an
asset to Pitt basketball games", one
said he was not, and 28 were
undecided. '

Auslander. who has led cheers at
Pitt basketball games during the
last three seasons, has
banned by Athletic Director Casi-
mir Myslinski from leading cheers
on the court.

Myslinski said last Thursday
Auslander should not be used
because Pitt already has official
cheerleaders and Golden Girls to
spur student support at games.

“Tiger Paul's become a Pitts-
burgh legend," senior Vince
DeFalice said. ‘.‘He's at Central
Catholic games and Pirate games,

.and I don't see where he's been

doing any harm."

“I was really looking forward to '

basketball season." said .John
Pietrovito, a prelaw student. “But

without Tiger, the games could be '

dull." .

The student who favored the
ban on Auslander asked to. remain
unidentiﬁed. “I think he just
makes a fool of himself," the
student said. “Everyone laughs at
him." .

RSA Backs
Dorm-Safety
Modifications,

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

The Resident Students Associa-‘M

tion (RSA) recommended modiﬁ-
cation of the dorm security plan,
including freer access within the
dormitories for residents and
long-term structural changes in the
Towers, at its meeting last night.

“The residents of the towers 

should be allowed to go throughout-

the towers with only a phone-

conﬁrmation, instead of having to
be escorted,” said RSA Chairman
Marty Doerfler.

Under the RSA plan, non-resi-
dents still
escorted into‘ and out of the
building, but residents from any.
dorm could be admitted with a

phone call to the room they will be '

visiting. .
The RSA plan also suggests the-

hall councils be given the option of .

instituting stricter systems if they
so desire. _ ' ~

have an entirely separate system,”

The dollar amount of lawsuits in

UniversityDefendont
In 75-l 00 Legal Cases

The amount of lawsuits in which
Pitt is involved doubles each year,
Dutton said, and in an effort to
decrease involvement in outside
legal services and to keep expense
increases at a minimum, the Legal
Service Department was formed
recently.

“In many cases the University
found itself paying _ downtown
lawyers $50 to $60 an hour plus taxi
fare into Oakland for services that
weren't helping us win cases,”
Dutton said.

“We were paying what we call ,

out-house counsel, in essence, to
clot i’s and cross t’s.” 0

On July 1, William Hannon,
former ‘Labor Counsel, was made
director of Legal Services. Two
attorneys, Keith Burr and Matthew
Jackson, were named assistant
directors. ,

“Right now we’re in a transition
period, and we’re having some
trouble corraling into one office all
the stuff that's been spread
throughout the University,” Han-
nan said. “I’m just now studying
cases that are three .years old.”

The Legal Services Department
would like to cut outside expenses
and create a front-line defense

against lawsuits. Hannan said.

“Our real effort is to get things
settled at the initial stages,”
Hannan said.

He explained that if a University
vehicle were to hit a car. the owner
could first file with Legal Services.
Legal Services would investigate
and if it found Pitt at fault it would-

RSA suggested that locks,
similar to those on the women's

“Even if a person entered a floor
and got into a room, by having the
stairwell doors locked, you’ve
trapped the theft in the stairwell.

fﬁfhis could be done in the near

future." Doerﬂer said.
RSA also suggested some
changes in the Towers, including

opening other entrances to they

cafeteria and ‘another door to the
mailroom. A A

“The way the system operates
now, it's impossible to adequately
operate a security system between
6 am and 8 pm because we can’t
close offthe cafeteria. The only
way to completely secure the
Towers is with some structural
changes," Doerfler said.

Doerfler plans to meet with
Student Government Board mem-

/r,-Vber Chip Hubbard today to discuss

‘ ~'the RSA proposal

and try to
correlate it with the plan suggested
by Hubbard. The proposals will
then be sent. either combined or
separately, to the Office of
Residence Life.

The entire situation. as repres-
ented on paper, could be a mistake.
Some student groups could have
paid for goods and services for
which they were not allocated

funds.

The goods and services reques-
ted by student groups could have
been pricedtabove original estima-
tions. but paid for anyway.

Platt said the maximum amount
Allocations could have overspent is
$5,000.

Cooper said the budgets of all
student groups funded by Alloca-
tions are investigated in an attempt
to ﬁnd the cause of the deficit.

Emergency funding requests for
student groups are temporarily
being rejected in an effort to curtail
the problem, she added.

BY STEVE FINE

What ever happened to streak-
ing? When was the last time your
path was crossed by- a body clad
only in tennis shoes and a
Halloween mask?

Certainly it was more daring
than swallowing goldﬁsh. And .it
was much more innocuous than
burning ROTClbuildings or rushing
police lines. It may never be
matched for sheer insanity and lack
of purpose. But what ever
happened?

The first few months of 1974
witnessed hordes of people
throughout the world shedding
their clothing for the purpose
of...streaking., There was no cause
celebre to. publicize, _no act of
inhumanity to bring to light. The
only cause was to see in front of
how many people one could run in
the nude. The all-time champion
was probably Michael O’Brien, an
Australian, whoistreaked 50,000
people, including Princess Alexan-
dra, at a rugby match in England.

No country, however, matched
the United States for sheer
numbers. Andlike most crazy
things these days, it all began on
college campuses.

At Pitt, the era of the streak was
brief. According to Lieutenant Sam
Conte of the Campus Police, these
are the bare facts:

Streaking lasted about two
months at its peak, March and
April. The bulk of the action took
place around the Cathedral and the
Quadrangle, although there were
isolated incidents all over campus.
It began with fraternities and was
picked up quickly by the athletic
teams. Women soon joined the
action, proving they maynot be the
same, but they are certainly equal.

And like all fads, streaking died
as suddenly as it began.

‘‘I don’t think there is any
particular reason why people quit
streaking,” Conte said. “There
were isolated incidents up until
June of 1974, but most of the
streaking was over by April.
School let out and there was a lot of
cold weather. I guess that had
something to do with it.

Streaking: Flash of Insanity 

It seems like only yesterday the Cathedral lawn was mobbed with

1974.

“The incidents weren’t very
spontaneous. We knew about most
of them well in advance. We had
men around just to make sure
nothing happened. We wanted it
confined to campus as much as
possible. .

“We weren't concerned about
people streaking as much as the
crowds they attracted.” Conte.
said.‘ “The ‘students were just
having fun, we didn’t want to stop
that. There’s no realgway to control
something like that anyhow.

“We were more worried about
the safety of the students. The
streakers attracted huge crowds,

as in this picture taken in the spring of I

and once a crowd gathers, anything
can happen.

“We only apprehended two or
three students. In these cases, it

i A Pitt would-be tradition has come to an abrupt end.

“Tiger Paul” Auslander, who brought Pitt basketball fans to their
feet with his unique style of clieerleading, has been told by the athletic

departmentjtotakehisseatintliestandswiththerestoftlie
 “unoﬁicial” cheerleaders. 4

What this means for Auslander is plain enough, as those who know
him will attest. But we can’t expect the athletic department, the great
bureaucracy on the mount, to take an individual’s feeling into
consideration, so it would be little use for us to make an issue of it here.

Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski has done it once again--and in
such a short time since he last made his ill-conceived policies felt.

What he’s done is give the students just what the, administration
wants, namely, cheerleaders who are hardly rousing, a band that imtil
this season was steeped in military stiffness, and some Golden Girls
who prance around, ﬂaimting their long legs. '

Auslander was one of those human phenomena that just seem to
oorne out of nowhere, seek to make people happy and have a good time.

, The unfortunate thing about such unusual people is that their stay is
‘- short and they leave not of their own accord.

“Ofﬁcial” or not, Auslander will be the only cheerleader students
remember 10 years from now. His performance was unforgettable,
his enthusiasm endless. And no one that the athletic department puts
up could ever substitute for him, for half the act was Auslander

» himself. .

Myslinski’s attitude seens to suggest that students will have to be
contentwitlitraditionalcheerleaders. Thefactofthematteristhat
students will not be content with the monotonous gymnastics -on the
sidelines,butwillgobacktowatchingthegame.

Evidence for this has been shown consistently at football games.

‘When students are not led by cheering groups in the stands, usually

fraternities, they watch the ﬁeld. And even the loudspeakers used this
year by the cheerleaders to overpower the mavericks in the stands have
failed. '
And so it will be at basketball games this winter without Auslander.

necessarily forbid from getting on the floor,” the other half of the
doublemeaningsaystha_tAuslanderisanembarassmenttothenew

When Pitt went bit-time sports, someone forgot to tell the students,

.and for this reason no one cares how other schools on national

I ' t'elevi"s_ion root.

’ 51%;’ ’ -What Myslinski wants Pitt students to do in front of the Camera hit

its  20 years ago. And students, probably because they’re on the

v ‘V — learning end of the desk, know to reject outdated ideas and people who

are bent on imposing them.

Though Myslinski may appreciate the old siss-boom-bah, some John

cheerleader when they follow one, and whether he’s "‘ofﬁc‘ia ” or not is
beside the point. ’

Stage Is Set in Mideast

BY TOM WASELESKI

Henry Kissinger’s latest diplo-
matic success has been achieved
not in some exotic land via‘ his
shuttle technique, but in Washing-
ton, DC, which, according to some,
is a helluva place to sell foreign
policy.

But sell is what the Secretary of
State did, and what will come of it
is out of American hands. .

-By agreeing to send 200
American technicians to the Middle
East, both houses of Congress have
set this country up for its next war.

State Department officials argue
that the situation in no way
resembles the early stages, of
Vietnam. They are mostly right,
but are on one count ominously
wrong.

The Palestinian factor will spell
the success or’ failure of- the

Football Saturdays

commitment. It's doubtful that
either the Israelis or the Egyptians
will ﬁre upon the Americans. But
as for the Palestinian Liberation
Organization...

The PLO -makes for an interest-
ing war. While Egypt and. Israel
are somewhat predictable and
sometimes downright uninterest-
ing, the PLO can make things in the
Mideast pick up whenever there’s
the . slightest. danger of them
slowing down.’ .

Though its international terror-
ism_ has helped it accomplish none
of its goals, it.has lost nothing
either, and will stand to lose
nothing more if it chooses to make

_a raid on the American technicians.

Congress’ naivete to this possi-
bility is almost unbelievable--it’s
almost as if Vietnam were 40 years
in the past. ' ' '

different, too.

What really brought out the
legislators’ simplemindedness
were two votes in the Senate. The
first, an amendment to bar any
American forces from being use“

for the rescue of the technicians;~-

was defeated, 75-5. A similar
amendment, barring “combat ac-

 

-git

tivity" to rescue the volunteers, '

was rejected, 68-25.

Perhaps Congress isn’t as stupid
as the votes imply. Maybe there’s
an ulterior motive for their Mideast
commitment-—maybe there are sev-
eral: Exxon, Standard, Texaco...

In this respect, I suppose the
Middle East is much different than
Vietnam.

And I'm sure that when all is
said and done, if these suspicions
prove correct, the outcome in the
Middle East will be much, much

Let There Be Parking

BY CAL RITCHEY

Last Saturday, I ran into
another of Oakland’s perennial
problems: no parking. This time,
however, it was different. There
was a Pitt football game, and
football fans were gasping uphill to
the stadium.

They were probably gasping
because they had to walk from
Greenfield or Bloomfield, in order

‘to find a parking space. Certainly

there were no cars parked on any
street between the Cathedral and
the Stadium. At 11:30 am, even
the parking lots and garages
seemed full, and besides, I didn’t
want to park for several hours.

I was trying to. stop for a few
minutes at the LRDC building on
O'Hara street, while somebody
picked up some work materials. I
couldn't park on the street,
because every parking meter was
hung with a yellow “No-Parking”
sign. I finally pulled into a
driveway and waited while the
errand was_ run.

b On Monday, "I discovered I

wasn't the__only one with parking VA

‘troubles. One LRDC employee
complained she wanted to.-work a
few hours on Saturday--something
very common in many University

ofﬁces on weekends--and had to

drive “all over Oakland” to ﬁnd a '

parking space.

Finally, the girl said, she found a
place, and put money in the
meter. When she came back to her
car a few hours later, she was
aware that the meter had just
expired, and was prepared to pay a
$2 over-parking ‘ ticket. To her
dismay, the ticket was there, all
right, but it was a $10 ticket for
parking in a no-parking zone.

The lady theorizes there had
been one of those yellowb“no-park-
ing" signs on her meter, and
someone had torn it off--and
indeed, I saw a dozen of the signs
ripped off along 0’Hara Street,
apparently by some irate motorist.

I called the Oakland Police
department, who referred me to

' the Traffic Division. where I spoke

with Sergeant Black. Sergeant
Black claims to have been on the
force for 32 years.
For 32 years, he said, the city has
posted “no-parking”. signs every
timethere is a major athletic event
at the ‘Stadium. ‘The signs are
posted all around the Stadium to
aid in traffic" control, “because you
couldn’t get the people in and out
of there otherwise,’_’ Sergeant

checking» for broken light ﬁxtures, loose handrails, etc., students ‘
should expect to see them and their walkie-talkies quite often, perhaps

too often.

Can we be assured of the student marshals-’ effectiveness? There is’
.a chance students keeping an eye on other students may  biased in
what they feel should be reported to the police. Those who went to
grade schools with safety patrols and  schools with hall monitors

know this situation all ‘too well.

Another point in question is the wearing of ,ID‘badges’ from one tower .
~‘ to another. Hubbard has strived for convenience in his plan, but
somehow students conducting themselves as if they were in a nuclear

laboratory doesn't, seem too convenient,

» HUbbaI:d'S_ ‘desire to simplify security is one thatshould bé satisﬁed
for all residents. It's our hope that he and Residence Lifecan work out 1

. 3 SY"Th_€SlS Of 130th PlaUS.',th'3I -W0i.1ld,.l5e.’,ef_f_ective,, but not ‘cumbersome. 

Black said.
Well, where are motorists

supposed to park, if they want to
attend the game, or to visit another
function at the University?

‘‘I don’t know,” admitted
Sergeant Black. “There are
parking lots and garages around
there.”

the problem, and fortunately, home
football games occur only a few
times a year. Still, it is
inconvenient to have to carry an
athletic schedule in order to know
when parking will be impossible to
find in Oakland.

Certainly the University loses.
because faculty members who
might be willing to put in a few
extra hours on Saturday will give
up and go home when they can’t
find parking spaces. Of course, it’s
always possible to ride the bus, but
in my case I was making a trip
outside the city, and couldn’t take
the bus to Oakland.

Maybe the University should
make some attempt to reserve

parking, either on the street or in a"

central lot area, exclusively - for
University motorists on such days.
It certainly would be easy‘ to prove
who is and isn’t an employe 'of the
University, since all employes carry
ID cards.

Perhaps there is no solution tog?

Life in the Fetus
Basis of Abortion

Thi9is in reply to an article
entitled -“Murder By Any Other
Name” by Dan Mulholland in the
Pitt News of September 24, 1975,.
His article dealt with the issue of
abortion, which he refers to as “the
mass destruction of innocents.”

Mulholland states that abortion
involves two lives--those of the
woman and the fetus. However, an

, eight-to-twelve week fetus has no

life of its own; it has no audible
heartbeat, nor is the brain

§ll|ll|||llllllllllllllllllll

developed to any significant extent.
I cannot understand how an
organism such as this can be called
a “life.” Surely Mulholland
realizes that a human is a human
only because it can think logically,
and plan for its future. Only when
these functions can be carried out,
as well as when fully developed
internal organs are present, is
there life.‘ Unless a fetus can
function in the world, which it
usually cannot do until the ninth
month, then there is no life inside
or outside the womb.

Secondly, Mulholland naively
states that the notion of abortion
vs. unwanted children is an
example of “twisted logic.’.’ He
writes, “Only the most callous and
recalcitrant ﬁends could slay their
own offspring so that they may
enjoy a few more materialistic
pleasures.”

It is clear that the author of
a statement is not in touch with th
realities of everyday living.
Children are extremely expensive
to raise; to feed, clothe and
educate. Thousands of normal,
middle-class parents have decided
to end an unwanted pregnancy
simply because their economic
survival could not withstand such
an expense. Thousands of children
are born every year to parents who
did not want them. These unloved

a . I

children‘ will always’ live’ lives ' or-‘

poverty,and despair, if they live at
all. Countless cases of child
beating and murder stem from the
factthat a child was simply never
wanted. Surely all women who
decide to end a pregnancy cannot
be called “callous ﬁends._” A
recent article in New Times states
that many of the Vietnamese
refugees are having abortions; the
reason being that their futures are
so uncertain and they feel this is a
bad time to have more children.
Are these women ﬁends? S
Finally, it should be added that
the womens’ movement cannot be
held responsible for the number of
abortions performed today. Many
women had abortions in the past.
Many died as a result. The
women’s movement has made
more women aware of * their
alternatives as far as pregnancy is
concerned. But they are not telling
every pregnant woman to have an
abortion. «
Never in the nation’s history
have the state and federal
governments been involved in a
medical issue, as is the case with
abortion. Every other medical

‘ question is left to the discretion of

the individual. It is, to my mind,
proper that the Supreme Court
should have freed women to make
this decision, which effects them
more than anyone else, in a
medical, economic and social way.

Monday.  
Puppeteer Given     

  Warm Ovation

Tuesday evening, October 7, I  
became a kid again with a little  
imagination and the help of 
Student Union Board. They spon'- ' '

sored David Synotiak and his
National Marionette Theatre's
“Art of the Puppeteer." For some
reason Ifelt right at home sitting_,in

the Student Union Ballroom with '

the other hundred or so. children
who ‘ranged in age from 5 to 60.“
Synotiak brought his inanimate,
stringed, wooden ﬁgures to life
with a grace and professionalism

that allowed me to appreciate his .

art and helped me cut away the
strings of reality and became
engulfed in each marionette’s act.

We laughed at the belly-dancer,
the hippo-hooker, and the Charles-
ton dancer.
at the ice-skater and ballerina.

We held back a tear for the hobo V

and for the finale, not because the

show was ending; but because we

actually felt sorry for .the wooden

puppet who searched for “an ‘

identity. . .
The standing ovation that Syno-

tiak and his associate received at

the end of the program should be

shared with the Student Union 9

 V ' (Continued from Page3)

after the fact, his role in the
incident continues to be a source of
em-bare-ass-ment.

“When/this whole thing hap-

to me and said, ‘You're a liberal
guy, so why do you go around
busting naked people?‘

“It was a strange situation. I
didn’t want to grab him, because I
didn’t know what I was going to do
-with him if I caught him. I mean,

just how do you go about arresting

a naked person?

“The crowd got pretty mean
when I was leading him away,” the
ofﬁcer said. “They booed and
hissed, and some of them were

‘ ’ stoning the squad car. I was really

embarrassed. It was like I was
arresting Robin Hood.”

Jim is a pleasant,
He is not a
bus-station degenerate. He is in
his ﬁnal year of pharmacy school.
Until the day he streaked, he never

 had done anything to attract the

attention of the police. And he

” ~ hasn’t done anything since that
day.

‘ “Every night on the news there

Vpfwere reports of people streaking
‘down South,” Jim laughed.

“We
were kinda bored, so we said, what
the hell, let’s do it. There was
‘snow on the ground the day we
streaked, but we wanted to be the
ﬁrst at Pitt, so we went ahead with
it.

“Six of my fraternity brothers
and I were in on it. We decided not
totell’ anybody, but there were
5,000 people watching, according
to the police. There were
photographers there too, so you
know someone blabbed.

“We were running across the
Cathedral lawn on Fifth Avenue
when I ran into the cop. Our

original plan was to run from

Hillman to Belleﬁeld Avenue,
where there was supposed to be a
car waiting. The guys I was with
ended up running all the way to the
frat house. They probably went
well over a mile. I guess that was
some kind of record at the time.

“When we got to the station,
they gave me a uniform to wear»
until somebody showed up with my
clothes. They seemed pretty
annoyed with me. They took me
into a few different ofﬁces so
different people could yell at me.

“There I was, sitting around in a
police uniform while they read me
the Riot Act and something about

“I was under the impression that

Ihad been arrested, although they,

never came right out and said it. I
guess they were just trying to scare
me so I wouldn’t do it again.”

Jim never tried streaking again.
He wasn't afraid to do it; he saw no
reason for it. His goal was to to be
first streaker at Pitt," and he was.

‘‘I wouldn’t do it again. That's
the kind of thing you only do once,
like swimming across Lake Erie. I
accomplished what I set out to do.
Why do it again? It was funny the
first time. To try it again would be

stupid.

“Streaking was great because it
gave people something to yell
about, to laugh at. This school gets
so dead all the time. You need
something to relieve the bore-
dom.”

Streaking was, as its name
implies, a ﬂash of insanity that
swept not only American colleges,
but also the world. Nobody really
has been able to explain why it
began. Some say, in the words of
Edgar Allen Poe, it was the imp of
the perverse. People acted for the
simple reason that they should not.
Unlike with the ﬂasher in the
alleyway, there was nothing sexual
involved or intended. The purpose

was to raise a few eyebrows.
Nothing else was raised in the
process. —
Streaking was an outlet, a way to
relieve the pressure of scholastic
competition. It ended probably
because of term breaks,

out of steam to let off. The novelty
wore off and it began to get stale.
Consequently, streaking has gone
the way of goldﬁsh swallowing,
hoola hoops, the miniskirt, yelling
“off the pigs,” and fur-trimmed’
Or has it?

There was a report recently of an
elderly gentleman streaking ‘a
bingo game in a California
retirement home. Said one
nearsighted observer of the inci-
dent, “I couldn't really see at ﬁrst
glance what he was wearing, but it
sure needed pressing.”

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

During the fall Pittsburgh may
be someplace special, but as winter
approaches and the skies begin to
darken, the city gets grubbier and
somehow “less unique." As you
trudge back and forth between the
library and the Cathedral, feeling
the capillary action draw the slush
up to your knees, all you can think
about is getting away. Or at least
preparing to get away.

Any CAS student can spend the

winter preparing to get away next
April with the Latin American
Studies Field Trip to Brazil.
During the winter term, instead of
dragging up three ﬂights of steps
in the Cathedral to ﬁnish distribu-
tion requirements, a student can
take an Intensive Portugese class
and Current Problems 22.

The Current Problems seminar
prepares the student for the
7‘/2.-week ﬁeld trip to Brazil. In the
seminar, students design a re-
search project to be done in the
ﬁeld and learn about the region of
Brazil they will visit.

A student can earn six credits
from completion of the ﬁeld trip to

the , 
weather, or that people simply ran

Studies or, in most cases, used for
credit in the student’s major.

In the past, students have gone
to Venezuela, Colombia and
Ecuador, and have done projects on
topics ranging from Adult Educa-
tion to politicalparties.

“The research project provides a
focus for your stay in the country,”
said Kathy Hurr_1ey.a student" who
went to Ecuador wilth the program
last _year. “But the really
important thing about the trip is
living in a different culture.”

Thomas Kelsey, the coordinator
of the program, agreed. “The
major beneﬁt of the trip is to
observe and participate first hand
another way of life.”

After the student arrives in
Brazil, the ﬁrst few days are spent
adapting to the way of life, and
learning to cope with the “culture
shock." The balance of the trip
(S‘/2 weeks) is spent participating
in the culture by living with a
Brazilian family. During the last
part of the trip, students have the
opportunity to travel through

Brazil. _ _ _
“The program 1s_1ntent1onally

loosely structured,” Kelsey said.
“The students’ time is pretty much
their own, but we encourage them
to involve themselves with the
family as much as possible.”

“It really depends on the
family.’i said Kathy Conahan, a
student who went to Ecuador last
year. “In my case the family
introduced me to friends and
helped me establish contacts for
my research.”

Next spring the students ac-
cepted into the program will visit
Bello Horizonte, one of Brazil's
fastest-growing cities.

The population.has grown from
zero to two million people since
1900. According to Kelsey, it is an
ideal place to study because the
migration into the city from the
countryside ’provides. a fascinating
cross section of Brazilian culture.

Twelve students will have the
opportunity to get away to Brazil
next spring. Anyone interested
should contact Kelsey at 624-5509,
or pick up an application at the
Center for Latin American Studies,
216 Mervis Hall. Applications
must be returned by this Wed-
nesday.

Etchings Thru theCenturies.

BY MREA CSORBA
Prints are often. bypassed by_
casual museum browsers in favor
of larger, more attention-grabbing
artworks. The humble appearance
of etchings and lithographs is often

Vﬂfimisleading. A close examination of

prints reveals marvelous displays
of intricacy and artistic skill.

The Museium of Art, at Carnegie
Institute is exhibiting 40 European
landscape prints. Besides gaining
appreciation of such ﬁnely detailed
works, the viewer is presented with
a mini art history course. The show
traces European development ‘of
etchings and lithographs from 1550
to the 1900’s. Represented are
some of Europe’s greatest masters.

The earliest works exhibited are

‘two engravings by 16th Century

Flemish artist Pieter Brugel. His
angular style provides an excellent
contrast to the looser, more natural
works of a few decades later.

J, 5.7 “Two Cows at the Water,” a

work by Dutchman Jan Both,

1 reflects this trend. Despite a slight

tendency towards Baroque full-
ness, Both presents a very
naturalistic etching of lowing herds
winding homeward on a mellow
summer’s eve.

Van Rijn Rembrandt takes the
trend one step further. In his seven
exhibited‘ etchings, the great Dutch
painter sheds all dramatic flavor of
pure simplistic representation.
Every line of his etchings goes
toward an unaffected end.

The 18th Century prints of
Francesco Piranesi and Antonio

_f_:fCanaletto illustrate the glorious

effects attained by the perfection of
the “High Baroque” style.
Canaletto’s “Ale Porte de Dole”
gives us a merry parade of gondola
traffic on Venice"s waterways.
Through amazing technique, Can-_

 

aletto conveys (in black and white)
the impression of a brilliant
sunshine reﬂected by the seem-
ingly sheer glass water surface.
The theme of Piranessi’s etch-
ings is the glorification of “that
which was once Rome.” Though
the ancient ruins have settled into
the rustic countryside, the remain-
ing columns seem to emit the
proudness of the grand past. The
shrubbery growing _from the stone
cracks are like laurel wreaths
adorning the ancient civilization.
French realism dominates the
museum’s exhibition of 19th
Century prints. Charles Emile
J acque depicts obscure commoners
“doing their thing” in the etching
“Peasants House.” Though the
work retains a touch of sentimen-
tality, Jacques’ style is noticeably
more realistic than his 18th

Century forerunners.

“The Gleaners,” a print of
Francois Millet’s famous work, has
no-trace Qf idyllism left. Millet
breaks from the past by painting
what he sees with no attempt to
_modify reality. Up to then peasants
were portrayed patronizingly as
clumsy, harmless oafs. Rustic farm
scences were pictured as pleasantly
shabby nostalgic retreats.

Millet represents rural life as it
is. His peasant forms are heavy’
and angular. Women with strained
backs stoop and sweat profusely
under the’beating sun. Under-
standably, Millet’s contemporaries
found his illustrations “barbaric.”

A variety of styles is being shown
at this exhibition, but a common
point with all is their superb

‘Smile’ Comes to Town 

Despite Past Failure

BY RICK SIEGEL

Smile is a cinematic farce of a beauty pageant, the Young American
Miss, and it is a good ﬁlm. Not ‘perfect perhaps, but a good ﬁlm.

The problem Smile has arises from the lack of box-office success, I i

which translates into ﬁnances. Although movies are made. under the

pretense of culture and entertainment, the bottom line in 99% of tall I I

ﬁlms is money. Show the public what it wants to. see. A movie’s
quality in the eyes of a ﬁlm company, depends not on reviews or
opinion, but on how many people pay three dollars to see it. In the case
of Smile, not enough people have. -

I had the opportunity this summer to listen to Jack Goldberg, the A

vice president in charge of distribution for United Artists, which is the
distributor of Smile, as well as Jaws,-The Return of the Pink Panther,
and Love and Death, among others. Goldberg explained how the
successes of the latter three give Smile a chance to play towns like
Pittsburgh, despite its failures. These pictures have grossed so well
that United Artists has some money with which to take chances.

Smile opened in Minneapolis last spring after a big promotion
campaign, but no one went to .see the picture. Then United Artists
tried a few communities in Alabama with no success. The next step
was Los Angeles, on the UCLA campus, but still nothing. At this point,
most distributors would forego any "further efforts, but because of

Goldberg's conﬁdence in director Michael Ritchie's Downhill Racer,   ~'

The Candidate, United Artists is still trying. '

No one in the industry can explain why Smile isn’t doing better; most
of the major critics like it, and nearly every moviegoer who has seen it

echoes their opinion. When I saw it, I was in a ﬁlm class with more.‘

than 400 people, and only ﬁve or six voiced their disapproval. Then
what is SmiIe’s trouble?

It could be that Smile tries to cover too much in one ﬁlm. We are

bombarded with plots, subplots and irrelevant sketches all in the ‘space’

of just over two hours. We examine the plights of the 33 mostly

talentless» girls trying to win a beauty title and how they go about it. A 

Ritchie shows the brown—nosing, the vaseline on the gums to make
smiling easier, and the dirty tricks contestants play to hurt the other
girls‘ chances. At the same time, Ritchie gives us a slice of life of the
organizers of the contest. Bruce Dern and Barbara Feldon star as chief
judge and mother hen, respectively. B ‘

Dern is neurotic, as he usually is. This time he’s so wrapped around

happiness and the spreading of good will he doesn’t realize what a A
mess his own life is. Feldon has a similar story, ignoring the problems _

of an alcoholic husband who tries to decapitate her to ensure a

successful pageant. Add to this a J aycee president, a sexually curious , A

Janitor, and —a big-ume choreographer, and you have your hands full
keeping up with the action.

Even with its drawbacks, Smile deserves to be seen. The characters
are portrayed excellently, the movie ﬂows nicely, and most important,

 

it is fun. Catch a Smile.

commercial appeal has been one of
the largest pushes for C&R (as
opposed to C&W). The naivete of
John Dawson's vocals have put the
New Riders up on the fence, too.

Commander Cody’s music bor-
ders more on blasphemy than. on
aesthetic value. The harshness of
the perfect master's voice and the
booze-and-balls kick of the Airmen
have lifted their popularity to
immeasurable l1eights...let’s say
about as high as the gutter.

This, their sixth LP--(second for
Warner), comes close to being the
perfect mix of songs and attitudes
that represents this group of
lunatics. The previous effort was
overladen with production and was
a miserable album. With Hoyt
Axton’s production on this one, it
comes off much more chaotic and
true to form for the Commander.
Live from the Armadillo World
Headquarters was the album--
mainly for its guts and raunchy
energy. The main attribute of this
one is the diversity of tunes and

styles. The spectrum begins with3 ‘

Cab Calloway’s “Minnie the
Moocher” and ends with Andy
Stein’s “Gypsy Fiddle,” a fiddle
tune exemplifying his never-before
-shown technical ability. ‘
Then there's “The Shadow
Knows,” a little bit of nostalgic
indulgence in three chords, but
with the perfect air of cynicism that

 

makes a good Commander Cody
song. “Roll Your Own” is the last
vocal piece and is a tribute to all the
flavored papers you’ve ever
smoked...you’ll get it. Please don’t
pick up the tone arm before the
album is finished because you can
hear the end result of the album as
it heads towards the label.

ballsy than Ronstadt’s. She is
more breathyand nasal sounding,
but also has a much lower range.
When she reaches for the upper
ranges, it comes off far_ more

lilting. That is partially because of
the choice of material they utilize.

porary writers of the Warner field,
and Nelson has banked on the
blues writers of today.’ The best
example of this is the title song
written by Mike Bloomﬁeld and
Roger Troy (twosome from the
Electric Flag).

Apparent throughout this album
is the depletion of guitar work and
the heavy use of piano and organ
work. There is also a tremendous
amount of background vocal work.
“Lies,” a Troy and Nick4Gravenites
piece, is the most solid on the
album. The Muscle Shoals horns
and production make Tracy sound
like a woman onlthe loose, with
path leading toward the Fame
door. .

Past efforts aside, thisalbum is a
very tight and laid-back LP. lt’s
not totally unlike other albums, but
different enough to mark another
stage for her career. I think this
could be an underground album
because of its lack of the right
songs and its country-rock flare,
but it also could be recognized as
one in the middle of the crowd. Wo

So Long, Tiger Paul
a Great One

BY JIM SPANOS

“Tiger Paul” Auslander, the greatest thing to happen to Pitt
basketball since Billy Knight, has been banned from “doing his thing”
at Pitt basketball games this year. Considering the reputation the
athletic department has for making unwise decisions in this university,
this should come as no surprise.

For those of you who don't know or have never seen Tiger Paul, let
me explain. Auslander is a 30-year-old resident of East Liberty who
became the leader of the Pitt student section because of his zany style
of cheering. Auslander usually came to the games dressed in blue

~ tennis shoes, blue pants, a long-sleeved white shirt and a bow tie. He

would wiggle his body this way and that, rotate his arms in
propellor-like motion and run from one side of the court to the other,
‘high-stepping it all the way. And it gave you something to cheer about.
But most important, he brought SPIRIT to the games. Spirit. That
indeﬁnable word cheerleaders use routinely and which they describe to
the.students as something you “should have,” and if you don’t, then
something’s wrong with you.
However, the cheerleaders don't mean what they say. Tiger Paul,

A‘ ' . you‘ see, brought spirit to the Pitt student body. And the vibes he

generated bounced off the Field House walls like thunder roaring
across a deserted ﬁeld.

Tiger Paul realized one thing that to this day the cheerleaders still
haven't discovered: that college students aren’t interested in watching
a group of “Pretty” girls standing around, looking cute and, once in a
long while, saying something like V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.

A Tiger Paul has been rejected by thecheerleaders not because of their

' concern for the students, but because the cheerleaders are

‘ jealous--jealous that Tiger Paul could do something they will never be

able to do. Cheerleading captain Linda Armbruster said, “I can’t say
that I'm disappointed,” in response to Auslander’s removal.

Another cheerleader said, “Tiger Paul was good support for the 1

teams because the students really liked him. However, he didn't stick
with the team when they were losing."

Those comments are very funny. Cheerleaders should be most
concerned that the students display verbal and emotional support for
the team, which they did with Tiger Paul. That “the students really
liked him" is the most important thing. But neither the cheerleaders
nor Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski has given much thought to the
impact Tiger Paul had on the students. No, they want everything to
“look good" to the alumni, and Tiger Paul running around and
screaming and perspiring with his shirt tail sticking out and his bow tie
crooked, well, that just doesn’t project a “good” image of the school.

“Tiger Paul was just somebody we didn't necessarily forbid from
getting on the ﬁoor--just a spectator,” Myslinski said.

Wrong. For one thing, Tiger Paul was more than “just a spectator."
He was perhaps the best cheerleader ever to walk upon the floors of the
Field House, notbecause he tried to impress anybody with his manner
of dress, but because he was concerned with the outcome of the game
and felt he could help the team.

I As a result, the Tiger Paul cheering section will just have to move
into the heart of the student section at the Field House. See you at the
I first game, Tiger Paul.
And bring your bow tie, will ya?

‘HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHMHHHHHH

Philadelphia, Pa._...Did you ever '

have one of those days when you
woke up in the morning and you
knew things were going to happen
to make your day? But when you
got out of bed the first thing you
did was stub your toe on the
bathroom door, then everything
else was downhill. The Temple
Owls must have felt that way
Saturday when they were absolut-
ely trampled by the Panthers, 55-6,
in Veterans Stadium before less
than 11,000 fans. '
The opening indeed did look
good for the Owls. Sophomore

~ quarterback Pat Carey, a transfer

from Pitt, kept the ball on the
ground until he got to the Panther
38, from where Don Betterlich
attempted a 55-yard ﬁeld goal.

Unfortunately for the Owls,
Pitt's Leroy Felder can leap tall
buildings at a single bound. He
charged from the left end cleanly
blocked the ball. -

After scooping the ball _ up,
cornerback James Calvin Wilson, a
name that became very’ familiar to
everyone in the stadium, ran 52
yards for the Panthers’ first score
of the day. Carson Long came in
and kicked his first of seven extra
points of the day, which along with
his two ﬁeld goals moved him to
fourth among career scoring
leaders in Pitt history, and Pitt led,
7-0.

Eastem

From there everything went
wrong for Temple. _ On the
Panthers’— next series, quarterback
Robert Haygood dropped back and
tossed a bomb to Gordon “You-
throw-it-I'll-catch-it” Jones, who
went 75 yards for still another
score. Long made the PAT,
making the score 14-0 with just six
minutes gone in the game.

Temple did threaten a touch-
down in the ﬁrst quarter when
Carey kept the ball and ran 49
yards before being dragged down
by Felder and that Wilson boy.
Bitterlich made good a 44-yard
ﬁeld goal and the quarter ended
with Pitt in the lead by 11.

The second-quarter Panthers
were all offense, as Temple flapped
its wings but wouldn’t get off the
ground.

With a ﬁrst and 10 on his own 36,-
Carey threw for his ﬂanker Pete
Righi, but instead found Wilson all
alone for an interception. Haygood
came in and tossed a pass to that
forgotten man in the backﬁeld up
until this time (was his name
Tony Dorsett?) and “The Hawk”
showed the Owls what the big
(boys) birds can do, weaving his
way through defenders for his first
touchdown reception of the year, a
51-yard burst, as he moved into
third place for all-time Panther

_SCOl'eI‘S .

At the seven-minute mark, the
Panthers again clicked for a
six-pointer. Keeping the ball on
the ground and running the veer
with perfection, Haygood made it
to the Temple three, from where
Elliott Walker bulled \n for the
score.

Once again it was J. C. Wilson
who set up the ﬁnal Panther score
of the half. With a ﬁrst and 10 at
his own 29, halfback Bob Harris
fumbled the ball and Wilson
recovered on the 24.

Haygood wasted no time. He hit
Dorsett on a screen to the right and
the speedster broke two tackles and

went into the end zone standing up.
Long kicked the extra point and the
Panthers led at the half, 35-3. The
only Owl rooters left in the stands
were the band members.

Halftime statistics told the story. '

Pitt had 302 total offensive yards
while the Owls had 110. The only
bad stat for the Panthers was in the
penalty department, where Pitt led
with 40 yards in penalties to
Temple's ﬁve.

“I hate to look for bad points in a
game like this but the third period

.was sloppy,” said Head Coach

Johnny Majors.

Indeed both teams could muster
only a ﬁeld goal apiece, with
Bitterlich hitting on a 34-yarder
and Long splitting the uprights
with a 40-yard attempt. The
quarter was marred by some long
distance penalties for clipping and
roughing the kicker against Pitt,
but, on the bright side, Wilson
intercepted his second pass of the
day.

“Many times when a team opens
up a big score in the ﬁrst half they
have a tendency to become a little
lax in the second half,” said
Majors.

During the fourth quarter the
Panthers again put on a scoring
show, and Wilson leading the
attack. The transfer from Tampa
U. intercepted a Terry Gregory
pass at the six and walked the ball
in for the score. Then Long hit on
44-yard field goal and Matt
Cavanaugh completed a 14-yard
pass to Steve Gaustad, making the
ﬁnal 55-6.

The Panthers ﬁnished the game
with 441 total yards offense to
Temple’s 192. “The Hawk” picked
up 114 on 24 attempts and caught

two. passes for 80 yards.

“I am totally happy with the
team’s play today,” Majors said.
“The entire game was outstanding
and the big score means a lot. Our

Pantherettes Win Two

A BY PATTY TASCARELLAI

“I think the better the competi-
tion, the better‘ we play,”
Pantherette volleyball player Mitzi
Frye said after the two Pitt victories
Saturday afternoon.

It’s a good thing Frye’s
teammatesfollow the same philos-
ophy; several times during the
games, it looked like an upset was
very possible.

It was a tri-meet; Mercyhurst,
which has no facilities for home

_ games, played Ashland for the

opener. Then Pitt played Mercy-
hurst and took on Ashland for the
ﬁnale. The Varsity and junior
varsity teams played simultan-

. eously.

The Pantherette J V’s won easily,
defeating Ashland, 15-9 and 15-5,
and crushing Mercyhurst, 15-3 and
15-5. The. tension came in the
varsity games.

The Pantherettes played Ash-
land last year and although they
won then, they expected to ﬁnd the

team a lot stronger. And they were-

right. ‘
“Ashland improved immen-
sely," Pitt Coach Mary Kromer

‘ noted.

“It was an offensive game with
good spiking on both sides. A
tough match.”

The hard-fought victory -over
Ashland was not much of a
surprise; the real shocker came
from Mercyhurst.

Prior to the game against Pitt,
Mercyhurst’s Athletic Director
confessed that his coach had
seriously considered forfeiting the
match rather than have her team
demoralized by a mauling from the
Pantherettes. And after the
crushing from Ashland, it looked
even easier. '

The ﬁrst set with Mercyhurst
was easy, quick and painless; the
Pantherettes won, 15-9. But
maybe it’s unethical‘ to try a
“ ercy killing” with a Catholic

 

v - disaster.

1 is ‘still undefeated.

- n‘¢;o‘o‘;".n L r --

college.

The lead seesawed. An offensive
spurt put Mercyhurst ahead,
sending the Pantherettes into a
dumfounded silence. ,

“Talk out there. Talk! ” shrieked
the normally placid Kromer.

The Mercyhurst bench was on
the verge of cardiac arrest.

Diane Zaken pushed Pitt ahead,
9-7. Mercyhurst battled back to a
10-9 advantage. Then the
Pantherettes took the lead for
good.

The Pantherettes accredited the
ch ase from Mercyhurst to their own
nervousness. ,

“Just a little bit of nervousness

until we got things rolling. Just .

nerves, that’s all,” Frye explained.

The way to beat Ashland was to
start out fast; the games were
timed and, unlike most Pantherette

games,’ all
replayed.

Pitt and Ashland were evenly
"matched. The scoring was close
and balanced in the ﬁrst set until
Jamie Andrews—put the Panther-
ettes ahead for good, 15-13.

Ashland jumped off to a 6-0 lead
in the second. Pitt was unable to
generate any offense; Frye, An-
drews, Debbie Stinner and Julie
Richter were unable to score ‘more
than one point apiece. The
Pantherettes lost, 8-15. '

I The third and deciding match
'was tight at ﬁrst. Then Richter
gave the Pantherettes the lead,
14-9, and Stinner chipped in the
ﬁnal point.

“They were good competition,”
Richter said. “It was more of an
offense game. Ashland started out
slow and picked up momentum.

Bradshaw’s Passing
Beats Broncos’ Jinx  

BY YAIER LEHRER

Until yesterday, the Pittsburgh
Steelers had never defeated the
Denver Broncos. The closest they
had ever come was a 35-35 tie last
season, and when Denver started
to march down the ﬁeld during its
ﬁrst possession, it looked as if the
Denver jinx would hold.

But this was not to be.

The steeler defense stopped the
Broncos short of a touchdown, and
Denver had to settle for a 22-yard
Jim Turner ﬁeld goal. From there
on, it was all Pittsburgh, as

___J»-—~q_.uarterback Terry Bradshaw pick-

Ki

ed apart the Denver defense on the
ﬁrst Steeler possession en route to
a 20-9 Steeler victory.

After four plays, including a
clutch four-yard pass to Rocky
Bleier, had netted the Steelers a
total of 16 y-ards, Bradshaw faded
into the pocket and heaved the ball
to Lynn Swann 43 yards downfield.
Swann leaped into the air between
two Denver defenders and pulled
down the ball, falling forward into
the end zone for a Pittsburgh
touchdown. ‘

‘fBoy, can that Swann jump,”
Bradshaw said afterwards with a
wide-eyed look of amazement on
his face. “Usually if the receiver

/-and defensive back are close, I

won’t throw the ball. But with
Swann you can be pretty sure he’s
going to get it.”

Bradshaw’s conﬁdence in Swann
was exhibited on the Steelers’ next
possession when he threw a high
pass to the second-year man from

. US_C. Denver's Louis Wright was

_','.A
_}

all but hanging on Swann, but he
pulled in the pass and scored his
second touchdown of the game.’ It
was the ﬁrst time Swann has ever
caught two Steeler TD passes in
one game.

Bradshaw’s passing had to make

26 for 191 yards and two
touchdowns. With his performance
yesterday, he probably has estab-
lished himself indisputably as the
number-one Steeler quarterback,
at least until _last week.

On the Steelers’ next possession,
they drove down to the Denver
22-yard line and Roy Gerela came
on to kick a ﬁeld goal and make the
score 17-3. It looked like the

Steelers were going to romp, but it»

was then that little mistakes began
piling up. With a third down and
ﬁve on the Steeler 22, Denver
quarterback Charlie Johnson pas-
sed imcomplete to Bill Van
Heusen, but the Broncos were
caught holding.

Instead of "pushing the Broncos
back 10 yards, Steeler Coach Chuck
Noll elected to decline the penalty.
Turner then came on and kicked a
ﬁeld goal for Denver.

“We didn’t think Turner could

kick it’ that far,” Noll said
afterward. “We just played the
percentages.”

This was the first of a few costy
mistakes. All totaled, the Steelers
coughed the ball up three times,
with two fumbles and a blocked
punt, and were it not for a tough
Steeler defense, it is quite possible
Pittsburgh's season record would
have been 2-2 instead of _3-1.

The defense, led by Mel Blount,

- held Denver to 124 yards on the

ground and 170 yards passing, but
most important, the Steel Curtain
was to cme up with the big play.
‘Blount, J.T. Thomas and Jack
Lambert had one interception
apiece. Thomas added a little
excitement to his when he pitched
the ball to Mike Wagner, who ran
another 18 yards.
John Hufnagel made a brief
appearance for Denver and showed
everyone why no one thought the

A Pitt defender, trying to pass it
back upﬁeld, kicked the ball
straight into the air. It went,

- unfortunately, to a Rocket forward,
who passed it to Slippery Rock’s'

Pitt net. Rex put it cleanly into the

Bucci for the 1-0 win.

Despite the fact Rex scored the
winning goal, the real hero for

and the defense played extremely

As for Wilson, he didn’t have a
bad day: two fumble recoveries,
one of which he ran in for a TD, two
interceptions, one of which he ran
in for a TD, one pass breakup, and
a touchdown-saving tackle that
kept alive the Panthers’ three-
game string of having no six-
pointers scored against them.
“I’ve never seen better play by a
defensive halfback,” Majors said.
“His play was simply outstand-

they set out to accomplish. The
Owls’ feathers were plucked clean
by an offensive and defensive

he knew he was beaten, which is a
no-no in soccer.

“Most foreign" players will do

“He should have been thrown out
of the game, but the ofﬁcials only

gave him a caution the second time i

he did it.

In action last weekend, the Pitt
JV football Cubs avenged a
humiliating 30-0 loss of a week ago
by defeating a highly touted Kent
State squad by a score of 23-22.

Laverga Walker, Greg McCray,
and quarterback Tom Yewsic
combined for a total of 306 yards
rushing. ‘

“I would attribute this game to .
getting some players who would

travel with the varsity squad, to
make the‘trip to KSU. They played
with a lot of pride out there,” JV

Rock scored. Also, Kim Blasko had
a very good game.” ’ '

Blasko may be a question mark
for Pitt in the near future. His

-shoulder was injuredvearly inthe

game and it will be looked at later
in the week.

According to Bemis, there are_
other question marks for the
Panthers.

“Westill have areas where we
still need work,” claimed Bemis,
obviously talking about the offense
that has only scored 11 goals in‘
seven games. “We can’t expect to
win games with defense alone.”

The Panthers’ loss was a
heartbreaker (an overused term,
but very appropriate). Their record

dropped to an even 3-3-1. ;

Coach Larry Holton said after the
game. A -

Also last weekend, the Panther
Cross Country team made it three
in a row by defeating West Virginia
20-41 at a dual meet held in
Schenley Park. .

Nick Martin bettered the muddy
course in a record 30:40 to lead the
pack. Mel Boyd, also of Pitt,

ﬁnished a close second.

The harriers will try_ to make it
four straight, when they meet Ohio
University, tomorrow.
