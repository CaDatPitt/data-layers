Jon Goettler rolled a die while playing
atrivia board game on the ﬂoorwith
his sister, mother and friend in the
midst of a massive crowd in the AMC
Loews Waterfront Theater Thursday
night. He wore a long gray robe, wig
and beard as part of his Albus Dumb-
ledore costume. Goettler is 23.

Then a man in a short, black wig

 

and billowing black cape ran up to
him and brandished a wand.
“Avada Kedavra!” Shane Conrad,

V 22, shouted before sprinting away.

Many of the fans that lined up
for the midnight premiere of “Har-
ry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,
Part 1” wore wizard attire. Across
the country, similar scenes unfolded
in one of the highest ticket-selling
weekends in movie history.

Warner Bros. estimated the rnid—
night premiere ticket sales at $24

million, beating the $22 million re-
cord set by the previous ﬁlm in the
series, “Harry Potter and the Half-
Blood Prince.” The entire weekend
brought in more than $120 million
in the U.S. and Canada, and more
than $330 million from fans of the
series worldwide.

At Loews Theater, a swarm of
people dressed as wizards in black
cloaks and waving wands descend-
ed upon a small crowd dressed in
everyday attire. The ground ﬂoor

of the theater resembled a feast
in Hogwarts’ Great Hall as people
packed together hours before the

’ premiere.

Whereas striped, knit scarves and
drawn—on lightning—shaped scars on
foreheads were most common, many
fans, including Robert Hockenberry,

arrived in full costume early in the .

evening.

Hockenberry, 32, stomped
around the theater with a wooden
walking staff, blonde wig, tan trench

him for pictures recognized him as
Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody from
Rowling’s books.

“This is the last ﬁlm he’s in, and
I’d always wanted to go as him since
the fourth ﬁlm,” Hockenberry said.

Hockenberry attended the open-
ingfor the Half-Blood Prince as Pro-
fessor Horace Slughom. He didn’t
get involved with the series until the
sixth book came out, but he made

News Editor

Pitt police are searching for a sus-
pect in relation to an attempted
robbery that occurred Friday
morning, Nov. 19, in North Oak-
land.

According to a crime alert post-
ed on Pitt buildings and on the Pitt
police website, no one was injured
in the attempted robbery.

A man told police that he was
approached by a tall black man
just before 9 a.m. on Friday at
Robinson ‘Street Extension and
Centre Avenue. The suspect tried
to rob the victim and failed. It was
not apparent if the suspect had a
weapon.

The suspect — around 30 years
old and wearing a long, black ﬂuffy
coat — then ﬂed down Robinson
Street Extension toward Centre

and Herron avenues, according 

to the crime alert. I

about a week.

Pitt student Mary Fakner, 19, combined
the characters of Harry Potter and Hermione
Granger in her costume. Her small, plastic
kitchen broom allowed her to whisk around
the theater on foot.

Fakner has been following the Harry Pot-
ter series since she was a child, but because
she never received her acceptance letter into
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
she likes to imagine the Cathedral of Learning
as her Hogwarts. S

Conrad, dressedas Severus Snape, has been
following the series since the beginning.
5‘It’s a classic story of good versus evil,”

he said. “It’s astonishing how [_].K. Rowling],

created a different world. It’s hard not to be
fascinated by it.”

He said his ﬁancée thinks he’s a “dork,” but .

he insisted on being the ﬁrst in line because he

wanted everyone to know that he’s more of a .

die-hard fan than others. A

He was one among a group of fully-cos-

She was waiting in line with her son Joey

midnight premiere. Moser came dressed as
Harry Potter with a gray sweater, a scarlet and

His HarryPotter obsession didn’t stay con-
tained to the walls of the theater. He works
at a bank Downtown, and he went to work

carrying a drawstring bag with the Hogwarts

just for children, but also for older
generations.

Not everyone who attended the
midnight showing was a die-hard

_ Harry Potter fan, but everyone who

attended the screening found them-
selves immersed in the Harry Potter
culture.

Patty Himes, 46, didn’t initially
have plans to dress up, but “her
friends made her.” Wearing thick
spectacles, abandana around a long
mane of messy, brown hair and car-
rying a crystal ball, Himes said that
she was proud to take the part of
Professor 'I‘relawney, a divination
teacher.

When the doors to thetheater
opened, people presented their
ticket stubs and sprinted through
the hall to the theater.

“H-P! H-P! H-P!” everyone

shouted, high-ﬁving each other as 1

they ran.

Zachariah Swope, 19, arrived ex-
tra early for the “Harry Potter Ad-
venture” experience. Loews offered
a deal to patrons to view the ﬁfth and

sixth movies before the seventh ﬁlm.

1 Swope, who said he was dressed as a

Muggle, showed up for the Monday
premiere at 1 p.m.

“I come to the ﬁrst movie show-
ings out of a sense of loyalty,” Swope
said.

He said that he’s loved each of the
ﬁlms that have come out. He said the
most recent installment exceeded his
expectations, and that he’s excited
to see the same level of devotion to
part one of the ﬁlm applied to the
second part.

The ﬁrst part of Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows is bittersweet
for fans. They can ﬁnally watch the
anticipated ﬁnal installment, but
then the Harry Potter series comes
to close. ~

“We don’t want to talk about it,”
Conrad said. “Inthe past we could al-
ways wait for the nextbook or movie,
but after the ﬁnal movie, there isn’t
anything next.” -

“Even though the movies will be
over, Harry Potter is going to be here
forever,” Fakner said. I

pat-downs unveiledlastweekat

.S. airports prompt travelers

to re-examine howmuch oftheirphysi—

cal property they want the government

handling, Americansarenow havingto

makethe same decision regardingtheir
intellectual property.

Last Thursday, the U.S. Senate

Judiciary Committee unanimously
approved a bill that would give the
Department of Justice the power to
quickly shut down websites suspected
of hosting pirated material. The bill,
the Combating Online Infringement
and Counterfeits Act, would grant the
DO] the abilityto seek expedited court
orders that require domestic domain
nameregistrarsto shut downsuspected
sites. After the comrnittee’s approval,
the bill will now be considered by the
full Senate.

According to The Hill, industry
groups like the Motion Picture Asso-
ciation ofAmerica, tl1eU.S. Chamberof
Commerce andthe Recordinglndustiy
Association ofAmericahavepushedfor
the COI(‘J5£s passage. MPAA President
Bob Pisano lauded the bill’s 
of “rogue” websites.

While such illegitimate sites clearly
lurk about the Web and while COICA
tries to address worthy problems, not
eve1yonewasasquickasPisanoto jump
on board — nor should they be.

The day the Judiciary Committee
decision was armounced Senator Ron
Wyden, D-Ore.,vowedtoblockthebill,
sayingitwas the “wrongmedicine’ ’ for
addressing copyright infringement,
accordingto PCWorld. “Deployingﬂiis
statute to combat online copyright in-
fringement seems almost like using a
bunker—bursting bomb, when what
you needisaprecision-guided missile,”
Wyden said duringahearing.

Since individual senators can place

. holds on ‘legislation, Wyden’s opposi-

tion will likely kill the bill for the re-
mainder. ofthe session, butthat doesn’t
mean the newly elected Congress tak-
ing over Washington injanuary won’t
turn COICA into law. So were afraid of
whatjanuarywill bring.
Dorftgetuswrong, copyright hold-
ers deserve their property respected —
though we’re nottoo afraid “Lady Gag

' the artist ofher livelihood. Surely it’s a

basic element of a democratic society
for a government to protect citizens
againstwould-be thieves of intellectual
property, but it’s equallydemocraticto
practice due process oflaw.

We agree with Wyden’s position,
that the powers the bill grants the D0]
are too broad and too liable for abuse.
Improperlyobtained contentpervades
the Internet, but even sites containing
infringing materials have free speech-
protected content. We’re afraidthatthe
“expedited” nanire of warrant issuing

of digital censorship andtihatthe term
“rogue”act1ially-has broad application.
Sobefore Congress commits millions of
taxpayer dollars to such a radical con-
tent crackdown, we hope lawmakers
consider alternative solutions. ,

For one, instead of going after an
entire websitefor small infringements,
why not have the DO] bureaucracy is-
suewamingtothe site administrators
and give them deadlines for proving
the content in question was properly
vetted? .

Whatever solutionispicked-— and
this intellectual property issue clearly
needs one —— the government should
cover all the bases; it’s the same ser-

Sharia law ban

doesr1’t

disenfranchise anyone

Mark Kozlowski -

' Columnist

For all our eloquence against
tyranny over the years, humans
seem to like rules. We seek to
understand the world as a series
of rules, which is why we study
natural sciences at universities.
We also believe that people should
behave according to a set of rules,

which is why universities have
theology departments and law
schools. Of course, whenever hu-
mans have different ideas about
what constitutes justice, they ar-
gue, bicker and sometimes go to
war over whose rules are fairer.
The latest disagreement hails
from Oklahoma.

Oklahoma State Question 755
establishes that Oklahoma state
judges are bound to use only
state or federal law and shall not

use foreign laws or precedents
in reaching their decisions, in-
cluding Sharia Law — Islamic
law based on the Koran and the
teachings of Mohammed. It is this
last clause that has led Muneer
Awad of the Council on American-
Islamic Relations to sue for the
overturn of this provision on First

- Amendment grounds. He argues

that the measure stigmatizes
Muslims and limits their ability
to have a political impact.

The usual histrionics are on the horizon.
Supporters of the measure will say activist-
judge terrorists will trample our rights and
kill us if the measure is overturned, whereas
opponents will call the supporters racist
hicks. Regardless of what you think of Sha-
ria or international law, there are other
reasons to back the initiative.

First, let us answer some of the argu-
ments being forwarded by supporters of
the lawsuit — such as the Islamic Society
of Greater Oklahoma City —— who said in a
statement that the measure was a vote by
“over 70 percent of the people  to have
their Muslim neighbors’  religious free-
doms stripped and limited to the measure-
ments of others.” I

I vehemently disagree.

This is not an issue of freedom of reli-
gion. An individual has a right to follow
religious laws if he so chooses. But he does
not have the right to require those laws have
any standing in a court under the laws of the
United States. Allowing Sharia or any other
form of canon law in judicial proceedings
is a violation of the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment, as doing so makes"
religious beliefs a part of the American
legal code. As Justice Clarence Thomas
said in his dissenting opinion in Graham v.
Florida, foreign law “factors are irrelevant
to the meaning of our Constitution or the
Court’s discernment of any long-standing
determination in this nation.” The worst
you can say about the ballot initiative on
First Amendment grounds is that it is re-
dundant. ’ _

Whereas I understand Muneer Awad’s
concerns that this measure stigmatizes
Muslims and think it’s tactless to single out
Sharia in a “Save Our State” amendment,
the parties involved in the conﬂict should
realize that this measure does not limit
the political impact of Muslims. Muslims
would still be free to petition the legislature
to change the laws of the state or to run
for elected office. Muslims would stillbe
able to sue, press charges, serve on juries,
vote, protest and do all the other things
any average citizen can do. This measure

denies them no political rights. It denies
them something every one of us is already
denied —- the ability to infuse religion into
court proceedings.

This leads directly into why this mea-
sure can be supported on the grounds of
the 14th Amendment. If Sharia is applied‘
in certain cases involving Muslim plaintiffs
or defendants and not in all cases, we have
just created two separate systems of law.
This is completely antithetical to the 14th
Amendment’s doctrine of equal protec-
tion. Furthermore, if one judge decides
to cite Sharia or international law, there

is no guarantee that the judge in the next -

courtroom will do the same. So the same
trial, on the same charges, involving the

same contesting parties could have two '

different sets of rules governing it depend-
ing on which judge is, assigned the case.
Remove the ability to cite international
law or Sharia and you remove this potential
inequality. '

Finally, this proposition short-circuits ‘

a route by which judges could bend the law
to their individual whims. By citing foreign

law, judges would no longer be bound by *

our laws and our precedent. Thus, a judge
could do something very close to making
up laws as he goes by plucking parts out
of the diverse legal codes of the world and
writing precedent based on these foreign
laws. All of a sudden, we ﬁnd that our legis-
lators don’t make our laws anymore. They
are made instead by foreign potentates
and legislatures and U.S. judges we might
not elect. This is an egregious violation of
the doctrine of separation of powers that
delegates the making of law to our elected
legislatures.

There are, of course, waysto split hairs.

International law is important in inter-
national cases, such as those where the

‘ Supreme Court has original jurisdiction.

But in general terms, Oklahoma State Ques-
tion 755 is constitutional and a worthwhile
measure to maintain. ‘

Artists salvage, surf web for inspiration’

The SPACE Gallery presents an exhibition of artists exploring how their lifestyles and artwork are inextricably linked

Everything is changing these
days, including the way artists
approach their artwork.

The “SCALE” exhibit, pre-
sented by the Pittsburgh Cul-
tural Trust, attempts to look at
ways people can both live and
create artwork during an eco-
nomic downturn. Guest curator
Ally Reeves had this exhibit in
mind for two years and wanted

MOVIE REVIEW

to bring together artists that she
liked from around the area — but
ﬁrst she had to ﬁnd the “vein of
continuity” between each art-
ist. '

“The basic idea isthat all of
these artists have a practice that
is a type of creativity that is close
to their lifestyle,” Reeves said.
“So even in times of hardship
they are able to create work, be-
cause materials come from sal-
vage sources or because the art
helps them make money or relax
in some way.”

“SCALE” offers a variety of
artistic mediums, including pho-
tography collections, woodcarv-
ing, silk printing and video.

One of the pieces is a working
shower with a wooden frame and
a canvas that drapes around the
person who uses it. The piece was

_put together by sculptor Derk

Wolmuth using more than 80
percent salvaged materials.
Wolmutl_1,~a Canadian with a
background in woodworking,
considers himself a non—medi-
um-speciﬁc artist. -

“The idea behind the shower .

is that since this is a show about
living on margins and somehow
not in the standard way, this is
a place people can come to use
the shower,” Wolmuth said. “It’s
a straightforward functioning
shower.” ’

The shower plays around
with the “thin line between be-
ing homeless with a shower and
homeless without a shower,” ac-
cording to Wolmuth, who wanted
to explore the idea of living with-
out an apartment and a place to
go. . ’
The entire “SCALE” exhibit

Movie questions Bush administration’sdecisions

“Fair Game ” investigates Valerie Plame ’s claims about the Bush administration and their role in divulging her identity

Kayla Sweeney
Staﬁ” Writer

“Fair Game” I

Naomi Watts, Sean Penn
Directed by Doug Liman
Summit Entertainment
B

As history —— and Hollywood —
has proven, the United States
government does not need to
paint a bull’s— eye on your back to
make you a target. And, as “Fair
Game” proves, it doesn’t'need a
weapon to take you down.

“Fair Game,” based on a true
story, tells the tale behind the
Valerie Plame affair that oc-
curred in 2003 when a newspaper
published the name of a covert
C.I.A. agent after her husband
railed against the U.S. decision

_to invade Iraq in 2003.

Naomi Watts plays Valerie
Plame, a secret agent and mother

who must keep her real identity
a secret from her friends who at-
tend her dinner parties. At work,
she has to deal with post-Sept. 11
Iraq, and the chance that Saddam
Hussein might have weapons of
mass destruction. This uncer-
tainty is particularly interesting.
to look at nine years later.
Power politics come into
play when the White House gets
involved. In the ﬁlm, the Bush
Administration is portrayed as

~ desperate as they seek reasons

to invade Iraq.

One such claim is that Plame’s
husband, Joe Wilson (Sean Penn),
saw Niger sell Iraq yellowcake, a
form of uranium ore that can be
used to create the uranium used
in nuclear weapons.

In the 2003 State of the Union

address the evidence of a trans— ‘
action between Niger and Iraq .

was used as justiﬁcationfor the
invasion of Iraq.
It_was -this evidence that Wil-

son refuted and began to speak
publicly about. In retaliation,
the government leaked his wife’s-
identity to the press.

“Fair Game,” also based on

’Plame’s memoir, “Fair Game:

My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by
the White House,” is sometimes
unsure of what it wants to be. It
dabbles in the political thriller
genre while also presenting it-
self as a biopic trying to stick to

the facts instead of an outright

dramatization.

“Fair Game” would not work
if it starred poorer actors. But
Watts’ and Penn’s taut emotions
and heart wrenching breakdowns
are moving and force the viewer
to ask himself what the role of the
government should really be.

This movie additionally pro-
vides an interesting look at the
American psyche after Sept. 11
and forces the ‘audience to won-
der if the nation really behaved
as the film suggests.

As for his shower, it’s open and avail-

“People could just come down and get

research into the kinds of images men post
on Craigslist for. dating purposes.

Foley noticed that on dating sites wom-
en will usually post a simple portrait of
themselves, but men do several different
things. A ‘

“Sometimes they’re sexually explicit
and sometimes they’re something sweet,
like a guy with his poodle,” Foley said.
“Sometimes they’ll even post something
they like, like a nature photograph or a

beer. So the video is a slideshow categoriz— A

ing those photographers.”
Foley is using this project asa gauge to
look at men’s usage of pictures. '
“Artists often look at references for

new work, so this is my taking a look at
and presenting back to our culture in Pitts—
burgh in terms of what men are doing with
photographs,” Foley said.

Foley also teaches people around the
city about media literacy and works with
ﬁlm festivals. For her, technology-based
mediums allow her the most feedback,
which is what she wants to see.

“I discovered I want to have a conversaj
tion of some sort,” Foley said. “That was
how I got into doing art. As for picking

me, this has a bit of laundry out to air and

work, and the images of masculinity are

being turned into something feminine.”

As for “SCALE” overall, Foley said she
felt excited to see how people would react
to an exhibit that explores not just certain
topics, but the artists themselves.

“That’s partly what this show is about,”-
Foley said. “How do artists live and sur-
vive? What are their contributions? Do
things have to be the accepted way or do
artists sometimesget to change that and
open up new ways of thinking and doing
for people?”

As for Reeves, the projects show a col-
lection of creativity, and this is what she
wants to see.

“I think it’s encouraging for people to
see people without very much, but who
are creative,” she said.

VOLLEYBALL

Panthers fall in first roun

Louisville Cardinals capture tournament crown as Pitt hosts the Big East’s best

Torie Wytiaz
Stajfwriter

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
looked forward to hosting the Big
East tournament at home. But
sometimes, home-court advantage
only goes so far.

Even at home the Panthers
couldn’t push Pitt through to the
second round of play as the No. 6
Panthers fell to No. 3 Marquette
3-0 in their ﬁrst match of the tour-
nament.

In what senior Pitt setter Alyssa
King deemed a “crazy conference,”
the Big East title seemed to be a
possibility for each of the eight
teams invited to the three—day
tournament.

“I believe the championship can
go to any of the teams this year,”
King said, prior to the start of the
tournament. I

“We know our court well an
we also know that we need to de-
fend it,” senior middle hitter Imani
Harper said. “It becomes a serious
matter of pride.”

It was the second victory for
Marquette this season against Pitt.
The Panthers were shutout -3-0 on

‘ Oct. 31.

Despite the tournament loss,
Pitt’s two All-Big East honorees
Harper and senior outside hitter
Amy Town recorded nineand ﬁve
kills, respectively, whereas the Pan-
thers as a team lost the kill battle to
the Golden Eagles, 45-32. I

A major key to Marquette’s
success was keeping the ball away
from Pitt’s middle offensive attack
while also ﬁghting a home crowd
atmosphere.

Golden Eagles head coach
Bond Shymansky indicated that
his team’s victory was a result of “a
brutal outside offensive attack.’-’

“We knew that Pitt has incred-
ibly athletic and long middles,”
Shymansky said. “We did not want
to be up against that block all night,
and our outside hitters performed
well.” '

Ciara Jones was a large part of
that attack, as she earned a match-
high 12 kills._ ,

“We prepared for Pitt all week,”
Jones said. “We knew it would be

.a............,....-.a

The Panthers ended a tough season with a 3-0 loss to Marqu

tough coming into their home court
and that we would have to ﬁght
hard and I think we did tha .”

Whereas the Golden Eagles
went on to face Louisville in the
semi-ﬁnals, the Panthers ended
their season with the loss.

The loss to Marquette was also
the last match for seven senior Pitt
players, including setter Allison
Hodnik and liberos Brittany Fallis,
Melanie Feldman and Tara Rohall,
in addition to King, Harper and
Town. 4

After the early exit of the Pan-
thers, play continued at the Fitzger-
ald Field House as the four remain-
ing teams took part in semi-ﬁnal
matches. I

No. 2 Louisville defeated No. 7
Seton Hall 3-1 to earn a spot in the
second round against Marquette,
whereas No. 1 Cincinnati and No.
5 Notre Dame recorded victories

over No. 8 USF and No. 4 Villanova,
respectively.

Quarterﬁnal matches were all
played on Friday, and the semi-ﬁnal
rounds took place on Saturday.

In those rounds, the two top-
seeded teams, Cincinnati and Lou-
isville, prevailed over the competi-
tion to meet in the championship
match on Sunday, where Louisville
outplayed the Bearcats en route
to a 3-0 victory and the Big East
tournament title.

The Cardinals defeated the
Bearcats with set scores of 25-20,
25-20 and 25-15. With the three set
victories, Louisville extended its
winning streak over Cincinnati to
ﬁve straight sets, dating back to its
Oct. 31 come—from-behind regular
season win. 3 1

In the championship match, the

Cardinals posted an overall hitting I

clip of .401 whereas the Bearcats

tournament at Fitzgerald Field House on Friday.

managed only a .211 ﬁgure.

Louisville’s superiority was
also evident at the net, where it
recorded 11 blocks to Cincinnati’s
three. .

With the championship victo-
ry, the Cardinals have won four of
the last ﬁve Big East tournaments,
including ‘last year’s title match
against the Bearcats.

For Cardinal senior middle
blocker Amanda Simmons, the
victory was a culmination of Lou-
isville’s season—long efforts.

“For our team, it is a game of
heart,” Simmons said. “It is about
how well-prepared we are and how
conﬁdent we are and that shows in
the win.”

In addition to the conference
crown, Louisville also earns an au-
tomatic berth in the NCAA Champi-
onship tournament that will begin

on Dec. 16 in Kansas City, Mo. I

Vick
back on
top

Video game—like stats

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

I can remember playing Madden in
high school, and every time one of
my friends wanted to play against‘
me as the Atlanta Falcons, I would
make him pick another team.

It simply wouldn’t be fair. The
Falcons’ quarterback was an in-
credibly accurate passer and could
run for a ﬁrst down pretty much
anytime he wanted.

That quarterback was Michael
Vick, a dynamiclplayer who was
so good that he even graced the
video game’s cover in 2004. But in
a well-documented trial where he

was convicted of organizing dog"

ﬁghting, the former Pro Bowler
served a two-year jail sentence
starting in 2007.

A funny thing happened since
then: Vick seems to have gotten
even better.

This was never more evident
than last Monday night, where
he dismantled the Washington
Redskins with his new team, the
Philadelphia Eagles, en route
to a 59-28 win where he put up g
video game—like statistics, going
20 for 28 with 333 yards passing,
80 yards rushing and six total
touchdowns.

_ Despite not even beginning the
year as the starting quarterback
and then missing three games in
the middle of the season once he
was named starter, Vick is mak-
ing a serious push toward being
named the NFL’s Most Valuable
Player.

With 15 total touchdowns this”

season and zero interceptions,
Vick is the main reason why Phila-
delphia is considered to be a real
contender to represent the NFC
in the Super Bowl. I

Vick’s improvement certainly

isn’t because of physical improve-is

ment — he was arguably the best
