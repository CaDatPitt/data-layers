‘Cash Cab’
to market
Chevy

Students
must claim
tickets at Pete

Gwenn Barney
Staﬁ Writer

Projects in Marketing is not just another
Students with ‘football season tickets now
have until Friday to go to the Petersen Events
Center ticket office to claim their tickets to
the Backyard Brawl on Nov. 26.

Justin Acierno, director of ticket market-

. ing at Pitt, said he extended the deadline
after hundreds of students joined a Face-
book group saying theywere confused by
the ticket claim process. T

When students who ‘bought football
season tickets received their tickets in the
mail this summer, they noticed something
strange about the sixth and ﬁnal ticket.

A The ticket for the West Virginia game is a
“false ticket,” and the instructions told stu-
dents to claim their tickets either online or at
the Petersen Events Center ticket oﬂice.

That the ticket says “or” is the reason for
the confusion, Acierno said.

“That’s where the ambiguity is coming
from,” he said. “I was working under the im-
pression from a men’s basketball standpoint
where [ticket holders] automatically come
[to the Pete]. I was thinking on a different
level than students were.’’

' To claim their tickets, students must go
to the ticket office at the Pete, regardless of
whether they claimed their ticket online.

An event on Facebook brought the issue
to many students’ attention over the past
week. The “WVU Ticket Claim” event gained
825 attendees by Monday morning — with

 — - j many students commenting saying they had

— not only do students learn how to mar-
ket and advertise, they also learn how to
jump—start cars. '

Students in Professor Bob Gilbert’s class
are participating in a contest thattakes
them out of the classroom and onto cam-
pus: They transformed Schenley Quad into
a Chevrolet festival yesterday. The D] was
out and people were playing “Cash Cab”-
like games inside four parked vehicles. Gil-_
bert hand-selected the 18-member class
— called ProsInMotion —— from more than
30 applicants. , _ . V

The class designed a_semester—long mar-
keting campaign for Chevrolet from start '
to ﬁnish as part of a nationwide contest.
The team received a $3,000 budgetfrom
Chevrolet to conduct the campaign and
will present its results in a ﬁnal project
later this semester.

‘ While Pitt students passing through the
quad were able to test their trivia knowl-
edge inside four Chevrolets yesterday,
members of the campaign were facing a '
test of their own.

The trivia game was so popular that the
car batteries in two of the vehicles died
from overuse. Campaign members had to
think on their feet to ﬁx the cars and ar-
ranged to get some jumper cables. The cars
were up and running again in less than
an hour.

“In general, everyone was pretty calm,”

For The Pitt News

The Phipps Conservatory is about to
build a large —— and notably green —
expansion near Pitt’s campus.

The $8.1-million Center for Sustain-
able Landscapes is planned to be one
of only a few “living buildings” in the
world.

That means it will consume zero net
energy, produce zero water waste and
will try to achieve the three highest
certifications for green design. The
Conservatory —-- already free to Pitt
students — should open the new center
by December 2011.

The plans say that the new center will
serve as a teaching tool for other green
building designs in the future.

“We want to show people that the
technology exists now to integrate
buildings into the landscape in an en-
vironmentally friendly manner,” Phipps
Conservatory director Richard Piacen-
.tini said.

This new 24,350-square foot Center
for Sustainable Landscapes will be adja-
cent to Phipps’ Tropical Rainforest fac-
ing Panther Hollow in Schenley Park.

According to the site plans, created
by The Design Alliance Architects and
provided by Deborah McGuire, execu-
tive assistant to the Phipps Conserva-
tory, the new center will use the most
cutting-edge technologies to maximize
sustainability.

The center will achieve net zero en-
ergy through technologies like solar
photovoltaic arrays atop adjacent build-
ings to capture energy from the sun and
generate electricity, along with vertical-
axis wind turbines to generate electric-
ity when wind is more than 2 miles per
hour, according to the design plan.

It will produce zero water waste
through technologies like rainwater
harvesting, which captures storm wa-
ter from the roofs and lower sites and

center

  Phipps to build new green

 

The Phipps Conservatory plans to add a new “living building’

stores it in underground tanks for use,
and a lagoon system, which captures
storm water runoff and replicates the
natural water treatment process.

Piacentini said the building will help
solidify Pittsburgh’s ranking as one of
the United States’ greenest cities.

Eden Brukman, vice president of
the International Living Building In-
stitute, said that construction of new
buildings should reach for more, like
Phipps. The Living Building Institute
runs the “Living Building Challenge,”
which calls for more environmentally
friendly construction.

“What if every single act of design
and construction would make the world
a better place?” Brukman said in a
phone interview this week.

Besides “living” status, the plans call
for the center to be LEED certified and
SITES landscaping certified.

LEED, which stands for Leadership
in Environmental Energy and Design, is
the second—highest standard for green
architectural design, recently upped
by the new Living Building Challenge.
SITES can be thought of as a LEED cer-
tification for landscaping, Piacentini
said.

’ that will be sustainable and consume zero net energy.

According to LEED’s Website, LEED
Platinum Certification is voluntary and
provides third-party verification that
a building or community was designed
and built using strategies aimed at im-‘
proving performance in areas such as
energy savings, water efficiency and
carbon-dioxide emissions reduction.

“I think the CSL will definitely
spread environmental awareness to Pitt

students,” said Pitt junior Matt Tam- '

rowski.“‘It will show people the effects
our current world is having on the en-
vironment as opposed to the reduced
effects of this new technology.” I’

Class tries to boost Chevy’s image

The Projects in Marketing Class will compete against 23 schools for a $6,000 prize

Marketing 4 1

said ProsInMotion spokeswoman and Pitt
student Teresa Bresticker. ”We’ve run into
a million roadblocks, and we just have to

-1 get around them. Just get a little creative
and think outside the box.”

Problems like the one ProsInMotion
faced yesterday are typical for an average
marketing ﬁrm, but not something students
usually come to face while in school.

“It’s a shot at applying what they work at
in school to a real life situation,” Chevrolet
representative Bryan Wunsche said.

Judges from Chevrolet and EdVenture
Partners, a marketing education consul-
tancy,will pick which of the 23 schools

competing can build. the best campaign

’4‘4‘aimed at Generation Y. The winners take

. in $5,000, and Pitt’s team is competing
against classes from Boston College, Drexel
University, University of Arizona, Howard
University, California State University and
the University of Texas at Arlington.

This is the eighth year a Pitt class has
participated in the marketing contest.
ProsInMotion members said they have
put an average of 14 hours a week into the
project. i

Yesterday’s event in the Quad, Dare To
Be Smart, was the third and ﬁnal promo-
tional fair for ProsInMotion. The class pre-
viously had an event around Homecoming,
in addition to participating in Relay for
Life. Lauren Smith, team coordinator and
a senior marketing major, said the class
has made more than 10,000 impressions
— meaning the group estimates that more
than 10,000 people have seen its chalking,

with ca

ﬂyers, events or website.

“The class is so much work. So many
hours each week. But people know before
they sign up that it is a lot of work,” Smith
said. I

These hours of work include a wide
range of activities that comprise the over-
all campaign. In addition to three events
the group has staged under its campaign
slogan “Dare To Be,” it has also spent hours
spreading the word about Chevy through
ﬂiers and chalk, andthrough the creation of
promotional viral videos and a website.

ProsInMotion’s campaign used the In-

A ternet tohelp promote different partsof

its campaign. Its self-desiglned: website,

PittDareToBe.com, is linked to Facebook,

Twitter and Foursquare. ’ ‘ I -
“The Internet sort of links everythin

together,” Smith said.

The class is also using videos to reach its
Generation Y audience, including a parody
of California Swag District’s “Teach Me How
To Dougie.” ProsInMotion’s new — and
improved, in the class’ opinion — version
is called “Teach Me How To Chevy.”

The students already conducted a pre-‘
campaign survey and hope to conduct
a post-campaign survey to see if their

work inﬂuenced students’ opinions about i

Chevy. .
In the pre-survey, the class found tha

Chevrolet fell behind Ford, Toyota and -

Honda when students were asked-what
cars came to mind. Students ﬁrst associated
Chevy with American, affordable, cheap
and average, when asked for two positive

The class still has to create a ﬁnal pre-
sentation to be judged by Chevrolet and
EdVenture Partners. The ﬁnal presenta-
tion will culminate its semester’s work —— a
semester that might pay off after gradu-
ation. ,

Pitt alumna Shannon Conlon knows

I ﬁrst-hand how working on this market-

ing project could beneﬁt students. Before
graduating in 2006, Conlon was in Gilbert’s
class and worked on a marketing campaign

for the CIA. Her experience with the cam-
paign helped her land a job with EdVenture'

Partners after graduation. V

“When they go to apply for a position,”
Conlon said, “everything they are learning
right now is one step above other [college
graduates], in line for that position.”

Conlon said that the project is a winning
situation for Chevy, as well, because the
company is acquiring brand-new tactics
and media for how to talk to the college-
aged demographic. It’s common for the

‘ companies working with this marketing

project to expand good student ideas to a
regional-or even national campaign level,
said Tom Cronin, who managesthe Pitt
account for EdVenture Partners.

Whether they win the overall competi-

tion or not, members of ProsInMotion are

proud of the work they have produced.

“I think we accomplished more than we
thought we could,” team member Christian
Kratsas said. _ _ S

EDITORIAL

Don’t pass the
cheese, please  

Pizza is a well—known staple ofthe aver-
age college student’s diet. A

But‘ not all pizzas are created equal.

According to The New York Times,
after Domino’s Pizza tied in a survey for
worst—tasting pies, it teamed up with an
organization called Dairy Management
to develop a new line of pizzas with 40
percent more cheese, along with a new
$12 million marketing campaign.

Of course, with more cheese comes
more calories and fat.

In fact, “one slice contains as much as
two-thirds ofa day’s maximum recom-
mended amount of saturated fat, which
has been linked to heart disease and is
high in calories,” The New York Times

‘reported.

Compared to other pizzas, that’s a
lot of saturated fat.

According to CalorieKing, one slice

- of Pizza Hut pan cheese pizzacontains
23 percent of a day’s maximum recom-
mended amount of saturated fat.

One slice of PapaJohn’s original-crust
cheese pizza contains 18 percent.

V In‘; addition to at Domino’s, Dairy
Management has “helped generate a
cheese sales growth of nearly 30 mil-
lion pounds,” in places like Pizza Hut,
Wendy’s and Burger King, according to
The New York Times.

Although we aren’t exactly surprised
that an eating establishment is inject-
ing its food with more fat in order to
increase sales», we are surprised that
a government agency is advising it.to
do so.

The fact that Dairy Management was

created by the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture presents a conflict —— while
Dairy Management promotes all of this
cheese, the USDA warns about the dan-
gers ofsaturated fat and obesity.

“The organization’s activities, re-
vealed through interviews and records,
provide a stark example of in-herent con-
flicts in the Agriculture Department’s
historical roles as both marketer of
agriculture products and America’s
nutrition police,” The New York Times
reported. , .

Unlike in politics, where people can
use political cues like party identity as
a shortcut, health cues don’t exist.

We either have to trust the informa-
tionthat the government puts out or do
a great deal of self education.

As the cheese example shows, infor-
mation the government is putting out
and promoting can be conflicting.

So where do we go for guidance?

According to -Dr. Walter C. Willett, the
chairman of the nutrition department
at the Harvard School of Public Health,
“The-USDA should notybe involved in
these programs that are promoting
foods that we are consuming too much
of already.”

We agree that the USDA should not

be promoting and marketing excess of
what it knows to be unhealthy.
' But because the cheese example is
just another reason not to rely on the
information the government gives you,
we recommend you eat a little less pizza
or at least compare nutritional informa-
tion to find the healthiest one.l

FOREPLAY ON wonns

 

Hollywood creates unrealistic relationships

Leah Trimble
Columnist

“Dear John” is currently on the Starz On
Demand free movie list. I’ve been meaning
to watch it because,.well, two words: Chan-
ning Tatum. I am typically against these
disgustingly overrated romance ﬁlms, but,
as a girl or even a gay man, how can you
resist him? He’s an absurdly sexy, tall, for-
mer underwear model with dance skills.
Need I say more? I suppose these all are
very shallow statements. In this situation,
I just can’t help myself.

Tatum isn’t even really a reputable ac-
tor: I wouldn’t say that “Step Up” —— you
can’t even count the sequel — or “She’s the
Man” really deserve an Oscar. The truth
of the matter is that, in these movies, he
plays the typical American heartthrob who
realizes his leading lady is “the one” after
leaving her, and then has to run back just
in the nick of time — almost every girl’s
dream. ~

Despite Tatum’s allure, my roommate
and I chose to forgo “Dear John” as an
option now and in the future. _Why would
we watch two people have the most ideal
relationship ever, and then watch it end
with some sort of probable tragedy? Either
you cry because he dies ﬁghting overseas

—— the most logical prediction — or you ‘

want to give up on relationships because
you realize a real life romantic experience
is never that good. It’s a classic Catch-22,
and we want no part of it.

In fact, I’ve missed out on a few
trips to the Waterfront based on these as-

sumptions. Case in point: “The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button” and “The Time
Traveler’s Wife.” I’m notevenconsidering
all the movies that start off with friends
that end up together, no examples needed.
Just watch any romantic comedy. You’ll
get my point. '

forget the steamy, backseat sack session,

not to mention him sketching her naked
body? Oh, Leonardo DiCaprio, how you
make the adolescent girls swoon. You’ve

even moved up in the rankings lately, hand- ‘

picking partners from the world’s most
gorgeous models. If only we all had that

Hollywood has killed romance for

any of us living off - screen in the real

if World.

I was resistant to believe it before, but
the more I watch, the more I think it’s true
— Hollywood has killed romance for any
of us living off-screen in the real world.
The obsession with perfection has gone
out of control. It’s not enough that cinema
emits seemingly ﬂawless individuals, rais-
ing our beauty standards to immeasurable
heights. No, they have to go and add hu-
man interaction into the mix. Even RTE
News reports that “An Australian survey
revealed half of the 1,000 people polled
blame the gushy and unrealistic stories
for destroying their personal romances.
One in four said they felt as though they
were expected to know what their partner

was thinking while one in ﬁve claim the I

movies made their partners expect gifts
regardless of an occasion.”
I think my ﬁrst exposure to this dis-

torted reality had to be “Titanic.” Who can ‘

privilege. .

Now that I think about it, even Disney
had its role in damaging our early percep-
tions of love. Belle and the Beast had a
happy ending. 4 ‘ ' '

The thing I ﬁnd odd is that even? though
we /seethese romance_s as ideal, we don’t
imitate them like we do with fashion trends
or hair styles. Actually, we’ve never been
further away fromeconforming our every-
day lives to these depictions.

_You don’t just see prostitutes marry-
ing executives like in “Pretty Woman,” or
men preparing notes and trips for their
wives after they die as we see in “P.S. I
Love You,” or a doctor leaving his ﬁan-
cee for the woman he actually wants to
be with, “Wedding Planner”-style. Sorry
to single you out, guys, but it’s usually the
men who make all the moves during these
scenes. Sex therapist Dr. Gabrielle Morris-

sey agrees. He says that the gushy feeling
women get from these movies makes them
want their men to act “like the attractive
yet caddish” types they see in these ﬁlms.
Then they are disappointed when their
mates don’t reach this standard.

It doesn’t make sense to me as to why we
even go as far as calling these screenplays
cheesy or ridiculous. Obviously, some are

really overbearing, but most are only just - '

slightly tacky. It’s like we’re making fun of
common decency between two people, like
no one can care that much for another hu-
man being. It’s even like we’re trying to dis-
tance ourselves from intimate moments in
the process. Then again, in a world where

our thumbs have replaced our voices, and ‘_
letters are e-mails thatcare the furthest.

thing from lovely, how can anyone expect
some over—the—top expression of love? It’s
kind of sad when you think about it.

i As we move away from these Old World
romantic notions and into the days ahead,
I think it’s important we keep in mind some
of the things that Hollywood hasn’t forgot-
ten about. Hey, I’m not suggesting that a-
guy read poetry to me on the Cathedral
lawn, but I think that opening the door for
me or any other girl once in a while would
be nice. Ladies should consider paying
the bill on occasion, just to be fair. Most
importantly, do n’t.be afraid to admit you’ve
made a mistake and run after the person
you left behind. . .

See, we can still appreciate the “perfect
romance” without it being ideal or even
barely realistic. What relationship is ideal,

_ anyways?

groups Free the Planet and the Pitts-
burgh Student Environmental Coalition.
They cite two primary concerns: the en-
vironmental costs and the implications
for equitability. Addressing both would
be too much for one column, so expect
a discussion of equitability next week.

This week, we focus on the environ-
mental cost.

Ignore the dead goats for now —
which, I’ll admit, were a bit of a ploy
to keep you reading — and consider
what is guaranteed to happen at every
well site. Every well requires big roads,
big machinery and big, ugly contain-
ment ponds. Put this in the column of
inevitable environmental costs.

Now consider those horror stories of
goats dying from polluted ground water
and drinking water becoming ﬂammable

Environmental costs of

through infection by a combination of

methane and toxic sludge. According
to the Worldwatch Institute, a sustain-
ability organization in Washington,
D.C., this is not a guaranteed outcome
of drilling. Underground aquifers and
the natural gas deposits are separated
by thousands of feet of rock.

Contamination only happens when
accidents or improper disposal occurs.
I’m not going to pretend it doesn’t hap-
pen, but it’s important to acknowledge
that this isn’t happening everywhere
and that effective regulation can reduce
this (although I’m not naive about this
either). It’s only in a small proportion
of cases that water supplies become
bad enough to kill goats and pollute
drinking water.

So go into the concrete room and

natural— gas drilling

picture these environmental costs —
big drilling sites in rural Pennsylvania,
some dead goats, some polluted drink-
ing and surface water.

But let’s just look at the benefits
for a little bit before you rush to any
emotional decisions-about pushing the
button.

According to Tom Murphy ‘of the‘

Penn State Cooperative Extension, the

beneﬁts all stem from around $500 bil-

lion worth of natural gas. This is instant

wealth out of nothing, creating an eco-

nomic impact on local businesses that
“may be felt for years to come.” The
exploration could.boost the real-estate
market, drastically increase wages, and

provide employment. ..

Plus, according to the Department
of Energy, even the speculation of in-

creased reserves and supplies has sent
natural gas prices plunging around
30 percent in the Northeast» since last
year. V

Back on theisland then, you have
a choice to make. The environmental
images are emotionally charged, but
the possible economic benefits are
charged also — families with a decent
income, elderly people who can afford
their heating bills and a beaming local
businesses owner.

. Should we work to bring up human
happiness — which I believe drilling
does - or does the earthtsomehow get
a say? Do you push the button for us,‘
or refuse? .

The answer to that question is too
big for a Pitt News column. A

Kuntu Rep dissects Tubman’s life

Harriet Tubman was not an abstraction.
Nor was she sexless.

, Tubman, perhaps the best-known
worker of the Underground Railroad,’
was a complicated ﬁgure whose biogra-
phy lends itself to dramatization.

“As a young lady, Harriet was very
hard-willed and spiritual, and that
helped her get through difﬁcult times,”
said Stephanie Akers, co-director of Wil-
liam F. Mayﬁeld’s “Harriet Tubman Loved
Somebody,” a historical drama that Pitt’s

Kuntu, Repertory Theatre is currently
staging. ' ‘

“When I see theatrical representations
of Tubman, she looks god—awful — kinky
hair, slurring her words  They tend to
want to“man-ize’ her,” added Dr. Vernell
A. Lillie, founder of Pitt’s Kuntu Theatre
and the producing artistic director of
the show. ”

Kuntu’s production aims to humanize
Tubman through a focus on her work
ethic, her relationships and her gender
identity.

“One of the things Mayﬁeld wanted to
do with the play was to show Tubman’s
femininity,” Akers said.

Like all Kuntuiproductions, “Harriet
Tubman Loved Somebody” expresses “the
black intellect at work,” as Lillie put it.

For Lillie; expressing the black intel-
lect means drawing from a reservoir of
traditions — foremost among them the
tradition of Kuntu, a form of theater that
both entertains and educates. '

“Kuntu drama has been around for

centuries. It comes out of West Africa.
The process is to present our culture ‘as
it is,” Lillie said. “One of the things that
Kuntudrama does not show a great deal
of is selﬁshness. I want to make this clear:
Kuntu is about knowing each other —
what I call a lack of ‘I-ness.’ Theatre is
just not a solo game.”

Diminishing the “I” factor means more
than just cultivating a spirit of coopera-
tion. Kuntu actors often play multiple
roles, sometimes in the space of a single
scene. ‘

In “Harriet Tubman Loved Somebody,”
there are only three actors, but there are
three times that many characters in the
script. Thus, the actors are constantly ad-
justing their voices and demeanor, cross-
ing race and gender lines in the process.
Theorists call this psychodrama, or the
use of roleplaying to enter the heads of
others and explore their motivations.

Much of the play is narrated by Mahala

Yours Truly    

pioneers ,
‘math—pop’  

Sara Pecora
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh—based band Yours Truly had one

important thing going for it right away: ex-
perience.

The trio, consisting of lead vocalist/guitar.»
istjustin Portis, bassist/back-up vocalist DJ
Huggy and drummer/back—up vocalist Eric
Downs, united through a mutual acquain-
tance, jazz musician Gene Stovall.

All of the members had played with him
before, but one concert in particular brought
them together.

“It was the middle or end of my senior
year, and Gene had booked my band a gig
with his band in Erie,” Downs said.

' D] Huggy was already playingwith Downs,
and Portis came into the picture after Stovall
asked if he would play the gig as well. Downs
and Portis ended up carpooling together and
spent the two-hour drive discussing music

i and the way they felt it should work.

“By the time we got to Erie, we had a
band,” Downs said, laughing.

The group deems its genre “math-pop” —
a new take on the concept of “ma ” music,
an intricate, guitar-based take on rock, most
popular inthe mid-90s. Because its sound
didn’t ﬁt any genre in particular, Downs said

. the band asked itself, “Why not smash [all of

our elements] together into math pop?”

' “We talk about it a lot, because we don't
want to fall into the ‘we don’t know’ catego-
ry  we really want to categorize it,” Portis
said.

“The way we looked at it is  if you look
at the composition of the song, and espe-
cially _Iustin’s voice, he has an extremely,
pop—friendly voice, but we do have a lot of
time-signature—heavy elements, so we try
to ﬁnd the perfect marriage of these two,”
Downs said.

In Yours Truly, each member brings a
different element to the mix: DJ Huggy, for
example, is a skilled producer; Portis is ad‘
experienced singer-songwriter; and Downs
has a keen sense for arrangement and per-
spective. This might be due in part to their
divergent musical backgrounds: DJ Huggy is
a studio producer/engineer, Portis is a profes-
sional jazz and classical trumpeter and Down;
is a jazz drummer.

Portis said that their experience in profes-
sional music has helped keep them aﬂoat.

“Bottom line  a lot of bands are just in it
to be in a band, but we were musicians ﬁrst.
We recognize this is a job. It sucks, it’s painful
to know, but it’s a business,“ he said. _ _

While most bands feel that bad music
has no purpose in the world, Yours Truly
disagrees. .

“We draw a lot of inﬂuence from bad mu-
sic  We’ll take elements and say, ‘Okay, what
makes this not pop?”’ Downs said. “You can
listen to the most boring artist in the world
and say, ‘You know what, I don’t like this
music at all, but now what can I get from this
artist to either utilize or avoid?”’

The band’s debut'EP, The Co/omge, is, ac-
cording to Portis, “ﬁve songs that are well-
arranged about girls.”

“That’s not to say [we] don’t have songs
that are totally out of left ﬁeld and not about
that at all, but for whatever reason those are
the ﬁve songs [we] chose,” he added.

Future plans for the band include another

L CD and some out-of-state traveling. '

“We’ve since returned to Erie, played in
Greensburg and we’re starting to book out-
side of Pittsburgh in the surrounding states,
places like Ohio, Washington, D.C.,” Downs

said,’ mentioning that they’d love to eventu— _

ally play in Philadelphia and “make [their]
coverage area bigger and bigger.”

Kuntu founder reminisces

Lillie believes in “culture of love, trust and understanding”

Tubman < 9

Tubman, who marriedjohn Tubman after
he and _Harriet split.

“The show begins with Mahala reﬂect—
ing back on the life of [Harriet] Tubman.
As Mahala matured, she grew to really
appreciate Harriet’s accomplishments,”
Akers said. , .

The show, of course, aims to foster
in audiences an appreciation for those
accomplishments and also for the rich-
ness of Tubman’s personality. When asked
about an ideal audience for the play, Ak-
ers had this to say: “We’d really like to
have children come, because it’s such a
historical play, and we’d like to see that
African American history is ongoing —

not just something limited to one month
out of the year.” ' A

Preserving a space for examination
of the black experience has been Kuntu’s
project since its inception in 1974, when
Lillie founded the theater. Due to ﬁnan-
cial uncertainties, this may prove to be
Kuntu’s last year in its current state.

“I’ve had a ball. God could not have
been kinder to me,” Lillie said. “This year
I thought I would consciously train ac-
tors so that they are able to direct Kuntu

drama in the" future. Everyoneneeds a I

culture of love,‘ trust and understand-
ing. If you don’t have that, you’re setting
yourself up for tremendous pain.” _

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Due Date’

Jeffrey Ihaza

Staﬂ” Writer '

“Due Date” ,

Starring: Robert Downey,Jr., Zach Galiﬁana-
kis,_]amie Foxx

Directed by: Todd Phillips

Film studio: Warner Bros. Pictures, Legend-
ary Pictures

C

Todd Phillips’ “The Hangover’ ’was an immensely
successful ﬁlm, in partbecause of its novel come-
dic techniques, such as alluding to the ending in.
the first scene by centering drama around the
search forawoman’s ﬁancee. Phillips’ latest effort,
however, fails to update the formula. *

“Due Date’”s plot is remarkably similar to
“The Hangover’ ”s: It features a level—headed pro-
tagonist — in this case, soon—to-be father Peter
Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) —— and a foil, the
eccentric Ethan 'I‘remblay, whom Peter meets by
complete chance. The two embark on a journey
that, inabizarre sort ofway, brings themtogether.
Sprinkled inthe seams of this formulaic scriptare
moments of insanity aimed at generating laughs
—— but this time, these moments fail.

The ﬁlm begins with Peter traveling home
ﬁ'om abusiness trip inAtlanta. At the airport, he
runs into Ethan, awould-be actorwhose inspira-

formulaic

tionis “Two and a HalfMen.” After a string of
events only possible inthe Todd Phillips universe,
Peter ﬁnds himself depending on Mr. Tremblay
to get him home to Los Angeles in time to witness
the birth of his child. The two invariably wind
up embroiled in a comic misadventure, which

"includes a ﬁght with a paraplegic, taking drugs

and anurnﬁillof ashes. p
Unfortunately, the smart screenwriting that
made “The Hangover” a success is nowhere to

be found in “Due Date.” Whereas the former’s

excess and grandeur made its plot twists seem
unpredictable and fresh, the same frame doesn’t
work in the latter.

At one point in the ﬁlm, for instance, the
unlikely duo ﬁnds itself sneaking past the U.S.-
Mexico border with narcotics in the vehicle. A
carchase ensues,which impossibly ends withthe
two getting away. Throughoutthe chaos, however,
there isn’t a single moment where the outcome

, isn’t easily foreseeable.

' “Due Date” does, however, have its moments:
Galiﬁanakis gives a solid performance, exercis-

ing his versatility as he portrays the dark and _

troubled Ethan. Robert Downey, Jr., takes the
predictable script and does his best to provide
some laughs.

Overall, “Due Date” doesn’t do much to be
original or really revamp “The Hangover” for-
mula. Instead, it provides a few cheap laughs —
and only because of its star—suidded cast. I

{Pitt goes deep with receivers

~‘«~‘- Isaac Saul
For The Pitt News

One standout receiver on afootball team is great.
Two good receivers are even better. And three
good wideouts? A

Well, that’s the Pittsburgh Panthers this
season.

Jonathan Baldwin gets a lot of the limelight.
Everyone’s witnessed his spectacular athletic
ability, his tremendous leaping catches and his
body built for the NFL.

P“ But Baldwin isn’t the only player Pitt has to
represent its rising corps of strong receivers.
That’s because this season, the Panthers have
both Mike Shanahan and Devin Street lining up
alongside Baldwin. ' ’

Last year, Shanahan emerged late inthe sea-
son. He was the guy who put the cherryon top
of a 10—win season with a 13-yard reception on ,
a third and seven in the Meineke Car Care Bowl
to keep the Panthers’ winning drive alive.

On the play, Shanahan absorbed a jarring hit
and secured the ball — and with it the Panthers’

_ hopes of endingthe season with avictory. That

‘was just ataste. V

This year, Shanahan’s game has really started
to blossom. With 29 receptions for 391 yards
and a touchdown, he’s already surpassed his
season totals from last year (15 receptions for
211 yards) and is only continuing to get better
with the help of Baldwin.

“He really helps me out in all aspectsof
receiving,” Shanahan said. “I really think the
biggest thing he does is catch everything. He
catches everything, and that makes you want to
go out there and catch everything too.”

C Although Shanahan might not possess quite
lame athletic prowess of Baldwin, his work ethic

and knowledge of the game is recognized by
his teammates. '

“.He’s always doing the right thing, always
knows what to do,” Street said. “He knows when
it’s time to go to work, and he always has his eye

‘fan the prize.”

At 6 feets inches and 220 pounds, fans can '
expect Shanahan to draw more and more atten-
tion with each game. But if opposing defenses
can ﬁgure out away to slow down the combina-
tion of Shanahan and Baldwin, they’re quickly

,Kgstarting to learn that their work isn’t ﬁnished.

Street, who was redshirted as a freshman
last year, stepped into the slot position this
season and proved that he’s more than a viable
threat. ‘

stay in the game until late in the second,
but held off the hot-shooting Rams team
to come away with a 83-75 victory last

In the first college basketball game
of the 2010-11 ‘regular season and the
first of four 2K Sports Classic games
benefitting Coaches vs. Cancer, the Pan-
thers tested themselves against a- Rhode
Island team that went‘26-1.0 last year.

.“They came out strong .andT'they 

came out hungry, and we didn’t really
come out as strong as we wanted to,”
Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs said. “It really
showed, especially in the beginning.’_’
“For a stretch, it seemed as if Rhode

would'n’t miss  si‘ngle_ 3—pointer. . .
Delroyled the Rams with_20 points

Rhode Island shot just more than 45

percent from beyondthe arc, making -

“They hit a lot of threes on us,” Pitt
guard,Brad Wanamaker said. “We have
to pick it up on the defensive end.”

derous jam to give Pitt a 37-36 lead at
the buzzer.

The play, which gave Pitt its first lead
since—12:15 remaining in the first half,
seemed to give the Panthers momentum
going into the second half.

“That probably was the key part of
the game, that last two minutes where
they came out and took_ the lead on that
last buzzer,” Delroy said.

But Pitt didn’t do itself any favors,
turning the ball over 14 times and miss-
ing some easy layups, something that
the players said could be attributed to
first—game jitters.

“We missed a lot of easy points, and
that-’s something we probably won’t do

the next game,” Gibbs said. “But we
got this first game under our belt, it’s
a relief and now we just have to keep
moving.”

The Panthers will play the sec-
ond game of the 2K Sports Classic on
Wednesday against the University of
Illinois-Chicago.

But this first game of the season in
November certainly had the feel of the
ones that really matter in ‘March.

“It felt like the tournament. This
was a pretty intense game, especially
against a really good team early on in
the season,” Wanamaker said. “I think
it’s going to help us out in the long
run.” I - ‘

Confusion over Brawl tickets explained

Improper wording caused “ambiguity ” in WVU ticket claim process.

‘WVU(1

The creator of the event, Pitt student Hyla
Wallis, said she heard about the correct process
by word of mouth.

“I made the Facebook group in order to save

,people some grief,” Wallis said.

According to the ticket, the deadline was
Nov. 1, but Aciemo said that students can still
claim their ticket at the Pete. He asks that all
students who are attending the game claim their
tickets by this Friday. As long as they are picked

up by this date, tickets can even be claimed while
waiting in line for basketball games.

Acierno said the process for claiming Back-
yard Brawl tickets changed because student
season tickets sold out this year.

“We had a huge interest on a single-game
basis, too.” Aciemo said. _

By having students claim their tickets, Aci—
emo will know just how many season—ticket
holders plan on attending the game — which

falls over Thanksgiving break on Black Friday.

That way, he said, Pitt will probably be able
to sell’ some single-game tickets to students
“depending on how many season-ticket holders
say they’re coming to the game.”

He said students shou1dn’t-worry too much
if they_ have ticketing problems. .

“Wewilltryto work with people as much as
we can,” he said. “We aren’t going to penalize
anybody.” I

Receivers < 12

season, Pitt needed to pull it together fast. It
needed a spark. . ~

Ninety seconds into the game, on the I
-Panthers ﬁrst offensive play from the line of

scrimmage, Street provided that spark with a
79-yard touchdown reception from Tino Sun-
seri to give Pitt a 7-0 lead. The Panthers never
looked back. 5

That spark ignited a Pitt team that is now
onathree-game winning streak and inastrong
position to win the Big East Conference after
falling short lasts'eason;. .

As a young receiver, Street shows his matu-
rity when reﬂecting on his ﬁrst year at Pitt.

“I wasn’t going to redshirt at ﬁrst,” Street
said. “But I think we realized one year of ma-
turity is really going to help.”

Head coach Dave Wannstedt also offered
high praisefor Street, who even exceeded some
of the coach’s expectations. i

“The one thingthat surprised me is howwell
he has progressed from a learning standpoint,”
Wannstedt said. “A lot of these young kids who
are redshirt freshmen like him, you’re always

' hesitant to put them in certain situations be-

cause it may be too muchfor them. But he’s made
plays in almost every game, home and away.”
A big part of having success on'a team like
Pitt is understanding your role. Street is one
player who knows what he needs to do, even

though he might not get all the glory.

“I think I’m that third guy that can step in
whenJ.B. [Baldwin] or Shanahan gets tired, and
I can create mismatches in the slot,” he said.

For the season, Street has 14 catches for 215
yards and a touchdown.

With the rest week leading into the ﬁnal
stretch of the season, the players to_ok advan-

tage of free time to be critical of themselves. _

Street understands that there_is always room
for improvement, and he expects a lot ofhimself
over the next few weeks.

“I want to show people I can run by defend-
ers,” Street said. “I want to go up for the ball too,
showl canbe more than justa shifty player. Also,
I’d like to be a more physical blocker, get some
pancakes._]ust be an all-around good player and
contribute in any way that I can.” A A

Wannstedt believes that Street can turn into

that player and recognizes his rare physical _

“ifou either get big guys that can catch, but’

theycan’t stretch the ﬁeld, or smaller guys that
are quick but they get beat up.” Wannstedt said,
“He’s a size receiver that can run, and it’s diﬁicult
to ﬁnd those guys.” .

Street’s attitude is a healthy one for a Pitt
team that has shown it can be great but also

' proventhatitcanalsohaveitslows.Withallthat,
I I Pitt still has a shot to do something great this

year. Street understands the ultimate goal.
“We all have our eyes set on that Big Eas

‘ Championship,” he said. I -.
