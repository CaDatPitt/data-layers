UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Both admired
and despised,
Thomas Detre
has been called
the architect
and monster of
Pitt's medical
structure

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

Dr. Thomas Detre has been por-
trayed as Count Dracula more than a
few times at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

The most obvious reason for this
dubious distinction is Detre’s thick
and distinctive Hungarian accent.

A less obvious reason to an out-
sider is the reputation for ruthless-
ness Detre has acquired since arriv-
ing at the University of Pittsburgh.

There are even rumors that Detre
sometimes actually dons a cape and
does a pretty good Dracula impres-
sion.

Detre dismisses these stories with
a wave of his handand a sly smile.
“Actually, that is not true, what is
title is that because I have a distinct
accent and I used to have pitch
black hair and I used to smoke a lot,
I was often categorized as a certain
person from Transylvania.”

However popular opinion charac-
terizes him, Detre could be consid-
ered the architect that built Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center into what it is today.

In 1973, when he arrived at the
University of Pittsburgh, WPIC’s

yearly budget was around six million
dollars.

Today, WPIC is one of the leading
psychiatric research facilities in the
country. .

When Detre, senior vice chancel-
lor for health sciences, has a goal, he
sees it to fruition.

VVhether the goal was to become a
doctor in .post- World War II Europe,
to consolidate his power at the med-
ical center or to make the University
of Pittsburgh’s hospital system into a
world leader, Detre refuses to fail,

regardless of the implications for
other people. '

Detre is quick to point out, “I think
that it is generally true that if you
want to make an omelet, you have
to break some eggs.”

Detre was born in Budapest,
Hungary in 1924. He survived WWII
as a young Jewish man living in one
of Nazi Germany’s neighboring
allies. Twenty-two of'his relatives,
including his parents, did not.

Two years after the war, he ﬂed

Mental stress
raises risk of
heart attacks,
.Pz'tt study finds

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

Acute mental stress can cause blood clotting,
increasing the risk of heart attack and artery hard-
ening in patients already at risk for cardiovascular
disease, according to a study by Pitt researchers;

The study, which appears in the December
issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, shows that
stress releases hormones, such as adrenaline, that
activate platelets in. blood (small cells that group
together and clot to stop blood loss during
injury).

“In a healthy individual there is no indication of
the potential to clot within arteries. But, if an indi-
vidual’s arteries are already narrowed [by heart
disease] they are more likely to clot in these
blood vessels, which is what a heart attack is,”
said Susan Malkoff of Pitt’s Behavioral Physiology
Laboratory.

Although the platelets do not activate specifi-

cally in any area of the body, the arteries and

veins going to and from the heait are at greater
risk in people who already have some blockage,
according to ‘Malkoff. The activated platelets can
also lead to atherosclerosis, or hardened arteries,
in these individuals.

The study measured platelet activation in 30
healthy young men before and after completing
21 minutes of stressful computer work designed
specifically to raise stress, according to Malkoff.
Ten control subjects were also measured who did
not participate in the activity.

Platelets secrete adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
as an indicator that they are active. The ATP
secretion levels increased significantly in the
stressed participants while the levels remained
normal for the control group.

The study, which is co—authored by Dr.
Stephen B. Manuck, Dr. Matthew F. Muldoon and
Dr. Zella R. Zeigler, is the first to show a relation-
ship between stress and platelet secretion of ATP,
and supports earlier theories stating that stress
may enhance coronary disease conditions by
causing clotting in coronary arteries, according to
Malkoff. '

Former New York City mayor
Ed Koch spoke at Pitt’s campus
on Sept. 23, 1993 for the
approximate fee of $12,500 to
225 individuals, approximately
2 percent of Pitt’s undergradu-
ate student body, according to
the Pitt Program Council’s bud-
get report. '

The report also showed that
the Homecoming Comedy
Concert on Oct. -15, 1993-featur-
ing Billy C. Wiitz which 355 stu-
dents attended cost $4,000.

The films shown at David
Lawrence every Friday and
Saturday night use up approxi-
mately $27,000 of the student
activities fee and of the 21 films

shown so far this year, 5,051
students attended.

Who decides what films and
guest speakers students will get
to see and how much Pitt stu-
dents will pay for these events?

The PPC committees made up

and directed entirely by Pitt stu-
dents.

PPC receives a portion of the
Student Activities fee and is
responsible for selecting lecture
speakers, providing ﬁlms every
weekend, planning homecom-
ing activities, organizing aero-
bics classes and coordinating
other student oriented events.

The present Student Activities

fee for full—time CAS students is-

$32 per semester, for part—time
students $10. PPC receives 35
percent of this fee which is

$11.20 for full—time students and
$3.50 for part—time students.
The average full—time CAS stu-
dent pays approximately $89.60
to the PPC to provide activities
in their four years at Pitt.
Although PPC receives a large
portion of the student activities
fee, Assistant Director of
Student.Activities and PPC advi-
sor Torn Misuraca said their role
is to provide activities students
want — PPC is not out to make
a profit. _
“We are not trying to make
any money.vWe’re trying to
,bring in some nickels so we can
take the $300,000 we get and
do $700,000 worth of program-
ming. Based on the numbers,
you can’t goto school here for
four years without going to

_ Professional

three or four of our events each
year. You may not know they
are our events, but you go to
them,” Misuraca said.

While PPC receives 35 per-
cent of the total funds, 50 per-
cent of.the Student Activities fee
goes to the student govern-
ments of the College of Arts and
Sciences, the College of General
Studies and the Graduate and
Student
Association. Twelve percent of
the student fee is allocated to
Pitt’s yearbook, Panther Prints,
and the Pitt radio station,WPTS-
FM. The final 3 percent of the
budget is given to Telefact.

PPC was allocated $302,531
for this year’s planning of activi-
ties, according to the budget
report. The chairs of all PPC

PPC badgetoatlmes expenditaresforspeakers, programs

committees were involved in
planning their committee’s bud-
gets.

“We get an idea from the
Office of Student Activities of
approximately what our alloca-
tion is going to be. We take that
number, say in the spring for
the following year, and student
directors budget programs and
do it on line—items per pro-
gram,” Misuraca said. '

“While we know how much
money we will get, how the
money is used is dictated by the
students who are directors,” he
said. “This allows them flexibili-
ty, it allows them to dictate
what they will get and also
allows them to go with the
times.”

PPC

Continued from page 1

The PPC policy is that any student can
join if they fill out a membership form and
contribute to the organization. Currently six
Pitt students are on the lecture committee

' and decide on guest speakers for the entire

university. .

Although PPC is open to all students,
some students said the organization should
reach out more to the student body for
input. '

“I think that they should survey students,
but that costs money too + I don’t know if
they have that type of access to all students.
But maybe they could get in touch with
RA’s and people in the dorms,” Pitt senior
Jana Dambrogio said. “I think they should
make some effort to reach students.”

Koch spoke to only 225 students this
September and some students said they
were dissatisfied with the amount PPC
spent for him to addresssuch a small
crowd.

“I think-they should get what people
want to see becausel ldidn’tl think that
lKoch’s lecture] interested a lot of people,”
Pitt student Robin Wilhelm said. ,

Misuraca said that many students don’t
understand the amount of money “big

name” speakers- want. George Bush runs for '

about $70,000 and Rush Limbaugh is cur-
rently charging $50,000 according to
Misuraca. A
“We could pay for these, lectures but it
wouldn’t be a well—rounded program then,”
he said. '
But other students said they believe PP'C



meets the needs of the campus. .

“I think they bring in a diverse amount of
people that affect the campus,” said Pitt
senior Rita Miceli, who attends weekend
movies and has participated in a PPC aero-
bics class.

In order to offer programs to Pitt students
at the lowest possible cost, PPC is very spe-
cific in that one has to be a Pitt student to
be charged the student rate.

“Students are giving us money so we are
going to keep our charges to a very mini-
mum. If we don’t get money fromvthem
lstaff, faculty, students from other collegesl
then they are going to pay the going rate,”
Misuraczi said.

However not all programming groups are
similar to Pitt's.

West Virginia University’s student activi-
ties are funded partially by a Student Affairs
fee. Activitiesare decided on by a “student-
staff committee,” according to WV_U’s
Manager of the ‘Arts and Entertainment
Department Eric Andrews. , _

“We don’t do many ‘big name’ lectures
and have chosen to dedicate our money
into other areas,” Andrews said.

WVU’s ‘big success is their film depart-
ment of student activities. Films are offered
five times a week for free and once a week
students are charged a $1 to see
Blockbuster Movies. According to Andrews,
the Office of Student Affairs surveys stu-
dents extensively for ideas on films and lec-
tures and survey cards are handed outat
every event. Concerts are also based on
radio requests and ticket sales.

Communist Hungary for Italy so
he could finish medical school
at the University of Rome. He
graduated from medical school
in 1952.

Detre left Italy for the United
States in 1956. He said he didn’t
feel there was enough opportu-
nity for him to continue engag-
ing in research in Europe. He
said, “IIn Europe] when the
director of the institute retires or
dies, his or her whole entourage
is moved away. There is no con-
tinuity.”

He said, “Although I liked the
food and hotels better there, I
liked the conduct of biomedical
science in the United States bet-
ter.” ,

After his arrival in the United
States, Detre went to Yale where
he was a professor of psychia-
try.

In 1973, Detre was offered the
chance to chair the Department
of Psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh. Detre jumped at the

opportunity and the challenge.

He came to Pitt from Yale
because, “I always wanted to
create an institute dedicated to
clinical research. I found out
what opportunities existed; a
building IWPICI that was half
empty, this is always the most
important thing. I decided this
was an offer I cannot refuse.”

After bringing WPIC to the
forefront of research psychiatry,
Detre was promoted to the pres-
idency of Pitt’s Medical Center
in 1982 by former University of
Pittsburgh president Wesley
Posvar. He then helped to man-
age the massive growth in the
medical center.

Under Detre’s leadership,
both Presbyterian University

Hospital and Eye & Ear Hospital"

came under University of
Pittsburgh management in what
became known as the Medical
and Health Care Division. He
also established the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute.

Detre was also UPMC’s first

president. He retired from that
position in 1992 and was suc-
ceeded by Jeffery Romoff, who
is the current president of the
medical center.

Over the years, Detre has
acquired a reputation for contro-
versy. Detre has a history of dis-
agreement with his peers on a
variety of subjects from homo-
sexuality to neurology’s place in
psychiatry. His theories have
become generally accepted over
time.

In the 19505 Detre made an
open declaration that homosex-
uality was not a disease.
Homosexuality was not

_ removed as a diagnosis from the

DSM-III—R Ipsychiatry’s diagnos-
tic manuall until the late 1970s.

He also objected to psychia-

tiy’s movement away from neu-
rologyin the early 1960s.
’ “In 1960, I said, believe it or
not, our psyche doesn’t ﬂoat 
That we need to have a brain to
have a psychic life. If you dis-
agree with the tradition, you will
be rejected. In the olden days,
you would be hung.”

His leadership style has also
caused a great deal of contro-
versy and sometimes even hard
feelings. His style has been
described as ends5oriented,
without regard to the means.

Detre replaced much of the

with administrators and doctors
from oeitside the system. Several
former department heads were
forced to resign or were
replaced.

He said, “If you are not going
to change anything, there is no
controversy. If you are pleased
with what you find around you,
you will be the most beloved
person in the world, but I’m not
temperamentally suited to be
the most beloved person in the
world.“

“I generally try to recruit very
talented people. My vision is
that they are so talented, so
energetic, so enthusiastic that
they will do an outstanding job,”
Detre said. I I

Detre, 69 and the highest—paid

employee at Pitt, did plan to
‘retire as senior vice chancellor

for health sciences last year.

> However, because theoriginal

search for a successor to his
position was unsuccessful, Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
postponed the subsequent
search until the spring.
O’Connor said, “In view of the
introduction of President
Clinton’s national health—care
reform package and its implica-
tions for academic health cen-
ters, the need for consis_tent
leadership in the University’s

Health Sciences is paramount.”

O’Connor asked Detre to put
off his retirement until a succes-
sor could be named. Detre
agreed to remain in his position
on an interim basis.

Detre said he believes acade-
mic health centers like UPMC
should play a greater role in
President Clinton’s health care
reform package.

“The Clinton plan makes ten-
tative provisions that recognize
that we [academic health cen-
ters] are different from ordinary
teaching hospitals,” Detre said.
“Academic medical centers
should be given a task for which
they are naturally prepared,
which is not only to promote
advanced biomedical science,

but also to be in the forefront of .

evaluating current and future
diagnostic methods.”

“We have two moral obliga-
tions in academia: to do the best
we can for our patients with our
current knowledge and to push
the frontiers of science.”

With all of the time Detre
spends working, it is hard to
imagine that he has any time for
a family. However, he is married

and has two children, John and *-

Tony. He met his wife,

Katherine, when he still lived in

epidemiologist at UPMC. Detre

said, “My wife is a real, working
scientist, not an academic.”

In his spare time Detre enjoys _

photography, reading, travel
and listening to music. Detre’s
spacious office on the second
ﬂoor of WPIC has several of his
own photographs hanging on
the wall behind his desk.

Detre said he doesn’t seem to
need very much sleep. He said,
“In my younger years I could
get along on four and one half
hours of sleep, now I konk out
if I don’t get six to six and one
half hours.”

Detre attributed his need for
more sleep to his age, bypass
surgery a few years ago, diet

and the 45 minutes of exercise

he does each day.

Detre recently visited his
native Hungary and reminisced
about his birthplace, Budapest.

He said, “At the time I grew up,
it [Budapest] was a kind of super
concentration of art, as well as
centers for biomedical sciences.
I am talking about prior to the
second World War.”

He also spoke of the great

‘changes in Hungary since the

downfall of Communism. He
said, ‘fIt is very helpful that it is
changed back to a free market
system  In _the meantime life is
vibrant.”

Detre is the picture of old-
world style and grace. He is
charming, elegantand very
engaging. He laughs and smiles
often during conversation. He is
cordial enough to offer coffee
upon a guest’s arrival or help
someone into their jacket upon

exit.

But Detre is also one of the
toughest, if not the toughest,
administrator at Pitt. He is strong
enough to stand up for himself

and what he wants. A recent dis-
pute with Senate Council and
Faculty Assembly President,
James Holland, provides a good
example of Detre’s feistiness
when he is engaged.

Detre took offense to the
manner in which Holland
brought up a tenure dispute at a
Faculty Assembly meeting. At

— the subsequent Senate Council

meeting, Detre said, “I do not
believe [Holland] should feel
good about it —— but he obvi-
ously does. He wants to arouse
emotions. He succeeded. If he
wanted to conduct himself as a
colleague —— he failed.”

He also said, “May I ask you,

 

are there any consequences
when the president of the
Senate misbehaves  and enter-
tains his crowd with unsupport-
ed allegations.”

Detre does not like to specu-
late too much about what the
future holds for UPMC. He did
offer some idea of what he felt
was in store for our medical sys-
tem. He said, “The future is
notoriously hard to predict.
More new knowledge has been
accumulated in the past twenty-
five years in the biomedical sci-
ences than in all of the history of
medicine which means that
there is a dramatic acceleration.

“It is possible to predict that

everything is going to change.
Increasingly, only the most criti-
cally ill will go to the hospital.”

When his successor is found
and Detre ﬁnally retires, he said
he plans to concentrate more on
neuroscience, which is one of
his driving interests. He also
plans to continue his affiliation
with the university, at the
request of O’Connor.

Detre said he feels that his
greatest achievements can’t be
measured by his work alone.

“I have never left a place
behind, where my successor

- hasn’t done better than I have,”

he said, “and that I am proud
of.”.

Participate in PPC

The Pitt Program Council is responsible for schedul-
ing extracurricular events such as bringing in outside
lecturers to speak, screening movies, and organizing

trips to concerts and points south for spring break.
They are responsible for spending approximately thir-

ty—two percent of the student activities fee.

Any student who is interested can fill out a member—-

ship form and join one of the council’s committees.
Right now, however, only six students sit on the lec-
ture committee. This is why a limited range of lectur-
ers is brought to Pitt. There have been complaints that
the lecturers don’t represent broad enough interests
and there are not enough famous lecturers. People
need to realize thatlspeakers don’t come cheap.
George Bush charges 70,000 dollars for a lecture. _

With this kind of money being spent, it is important

0 that the PPC has a lot of input from the students.

Although the PPC does advertise in The Pitt News,

i_more should be done to get these opinions.
It should be remembered that the group is open to‘

everyone. Students often attend programs sponsored

‘ by the council without realizing it. Anyone interested

in bringing programs to campus should get involved in
the committees. If they cannot be involved on a regu-
lar basis, then they can seek out members of the com-
mittees if they have suggestions. The council can only
work when students are involved.

Help the true victims
When most people think about the horrors of war,

‘ they think only of the dangers that soldiers face, but

often times the real victims are those not directly
involved in the fighting. The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
reported that the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape
will send counselors to the war-torn republics in. the
former Yugoslavia. An estimated 20,000 to 50,000
women have been raped during the war (Post-
Gazette). The volunteers are going to Belgrade,
Serbia's capital, in March to teach native counselors to
help women deal with rape trauma. In Belgrade there
is a major refugee center where many women come to
deal with the horrors of rape. '

The project started after a writer from Lancaster, PA,
Senta Troemel-Ploetz, had met women from

0 '-Yugoslavia while traveling in Switzerland.

This program is-a first step toward rebuilding the
war-torn republics that once made up’ Yugoslavia.
More importantly, it is a beginning toward rebuilding
the lives of people who have suffered the worst in the
battle between the various ethnic groups. Kathryn

- Geller Myers, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania

Coalition Against Rape, was quoted as saying, “rape is
rape and war is war and we’re going to help women.”
This statement makes the important point that the true
victims and losers in war are the people caught in the

It is still the economy, stupid

As is usual with the media,
they have allowed the news to
go unheard once the hype of

.an issue is_no longer surround-

ing it. I’m sure we all remem-
ber the media’s coverage
‘around the election, where the
popular slogan was “it’s the
ECONOMY, stupid”. Guess
what? It’s still the economy.
While many of us were con-
cerned with rather or not
Clinton’s tax (I mean budget)
bill would get passed, we have
allowed the issue, questionably
the most vital issue facing us,
to fall by the wayside". It is of
the utmost importance, in order
to remain even somewhat
informed, for Americans to fol-
low theseissues in the weeks
and months that follow the
hype. This is especially true
today, when we have a presi-
dent who has continued to
break promises, and at other
times, straight out lie to us;

Bill Clinton campaigned on
the idea that America was in
such bad economic shape and
in desperate need of (in the
president’s own tired, over-
used word) change. This being
somewhat true, after having
four years of a President who
continuouslybacked down to
-the money-hungry liberals in
Congress and turned his back
on Reaganomics. What did
Clinton do? He put Lloyd
Bentsen, an elderly, old-style
democrat, Washington insider
in as secretary of the Treasury.
He then wenton to play the
role of the stereotypical tax-
and-spend democrat.

He broke the promise of the
middle-class tax cut, raised
taxes on virtually everything

we use via an energy tax and -

included retroactive taxation.
What about his spending cut?
Not $1 is to be cut i_n actual
spending - the rate of spending
increase shall be slowed down
or redistributed from one pro-
ject to another, and that doesn’t
even take place until 1997. This
made Clinton the only presi-

dent in history to have his

taxes levied before he was
elected and his spending cut

not take effect until after his ‘

term. Regardless, his bill passed
by a single vote and was pro-
claimed a victory.

Well, it doesn’t work like that
in the real world —— only in the
glossy print of the papers and
the camera lights of television.

Booker T.
Stallworth

If you remember the vote on
the budget bill, you probably
also remember how tight it
was. "Many members of
Congress saw this bill for what
it was — a photocopy of the
Bush budget, which levied
taxes, had no spending cuts of
significance and sent the coun-
try into recession. No member
of Congress wanted to go back
to his Or her constituents hav-
ing passed this bill without
ensuring significarit spending
cuts.

Representative Penny, a
democrat from Minnesota, was
one of these congressional rep-
resentatives. He, like others,
thought the bill contained too
many taxes and not enough
spending cuts. In return for his
vote, he was promised by Bill
Clinton and the congressional
democratic leadership that he
would be allowed to author a
bill which would contain addi-
tional spending cuts. He took

, them at their word (the same

mistake made by President
Bush) and voted for the bill. .As
I mentioned before, the Clinton
budget bill went on to pass by
one vote.

That’s where the media left
the story. In reality, Penny
worked together with
Representative Ketchum of
Pennsylvania. Ketchum, a
republican, had worked on the

alternative plan proposed by
the republicans, which was not
even allowed on the floor by
House leadership. The two
arrived at a deficit—reducing
series of spending cuts, which
would take a penny of every
dollar spent by the federal gov-
ernment, and put it aside for
deficit reduction. This would
be an initial savings of up to
$70’billion ($60 billion more
than what the Clinton bill origi-
nally claimed). They then built
up a bipartisan coalition of thir-
ty democrats and republicans
to back the bill.

Well, the Penny-Ketchum bill
went to the ﬂoor on Nov. 22,
and do you think it got White
House support? In the words of
one of my professors here at
Pitt, “hell no.” Clinton, along
with-» Foley and a host of addi-
tional taxspenders, denounced
the bill saying that it would do
every thing from destroy health
care to sink the economy. The

, bill was defeated by six votes

in the House.

It is vital that we, as the
media, students and citizens do
not allow our politicians to
believe that we will not con-

' front them on these issues, bla-_

tant lies and all, once the glam-
our has left.

Bill Clinton was right when
he said he heard a call for
CHANGE, but it was a change
back to Reaganomics that the
people wanted. After all, if the
people _didn’t like
Reaganomics, why did he serve
two terms? And why was Bush
elected to a term? Bush was
elected because people were
hoping to get eight more years
of Reagan. That’s why he lost
the office when he backed
down from Congress and
backed out of his “no new
taxes” promise. Clinton is no
change. He’s a traditional tax-
and-spend democrat and we
knowit! Now-let’s let him
know we know it. I

The Panthersforce
31 RMU turnovers,
improve to 2-0 ’

Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers pressed their
way to an 82-53 blow-outagainst the
Robert Morris Colonials last night at the
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. ‘

The story of the game was the Panthers’
relentless defense. They ‘caused 51
turnovers — 17 of which were steals.
Point guard Carol Morton lead the thiev-
ery with seven.

“Defense wins games,” Morton said. “I
thinkthat is one of my biggest assets. We
worked well as a team, trapped and stuck
together.”

“Anytime you can get the other team to
turn the ball over that many times, it’s
extremely positive,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said. “I’m not one to focus on sta-
tistics, but that one is very significant.”

Pitt’s defense enabled the offense to get
easy shots. The Lady Panthers broke the
game open early by going on an eleven-
point run six minutes into the game —
Morton’s lay-up capped the 13-2 drive.

Pitt’s offense was lead once again by
Jonna Huemrich, who tallied 18 points
(16 in the first half) and nine rebounds.

Talking about the lopsided score,
Huemrich said, “I think it has a lot to do
with [the fact that] we are looking forward
to Vanderbilt. I think that’s why we
played so well.”

Rookie Missy Thompson also added 15
points for the Lady Panthers, going seven-
for—nine from the ﬁeld.

“Missy doesn’t miss many shots inside,”
Biuce said. “She catches the ball well, and
she knows were she is and takes her time
and puts it in.”

After an eight point run by the

the first half, Robert‘Morris closed to the
closest they would get — five points.
Then Pitt put the defensive clamp on and
strung together a 16-6 run to close out the
half.. As if the Lady Panthers needed any
more momentum going into the locker
room, they executed an in-bounds pass
with three seconds left to up the lead to
45-28. ,

In the second half, it was moreof the

turnover after turnover. — sparked by the
play of back-uppoint guard Joanne
Guzman, Pitt increased its lead to 68-41.
Guzman finished the game with eight
points, four assists and three» steals.

All but two Pitt players got in the scor-
ing column.

onewho got in there,” Brucesaid. “You
can go right down the list and pick out

Senior Stajf Writer

(Second of a two—part series
on the history of Pitt volleyball.)

The Pitt volleyball team
pulled together for one of its
best seasons ever in 1990,

‘advancing past the first round of

the NCAA tournament for the
first time in its history. '

The next season, head coach
Sue Woodstra brought Cindy
Braziel in from Texas A&M as
an assistant and put her in
charge of recruiting.

In addition to laying the foun-
dations for Pitt volleyball with
the athletes she brought in,
Braziel took on _a more central
role in the Panthers’ future

when she replaced Woodstia as_

head coach this season.

On the court in the ‘91 sea-
son, Pitt took a step back. In
addition to replacing seniors,
Ann Marie Lucanie was limited
by an ankle injury. Pitt was 28-9
and lost to Nebraska in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.

Off the court, Braziel was
bringing in a blue-chip recruit-

. find

ing class. Braziel said Pitt is
sometimes a tough place to
recruit, a place that attracts only
certain types of people.

“It takes a lot of homework to

reputation. I knew these were
quality people.

kids,” Braziel promoted to
said. “There head coach
are people “Someone
who come told me along

through that
tunnel from
the airport
and they are
here." My first
year at Pitt
was like that.
We brought in
seven kids
and signed
five of them.”
Atop that
class was one

time ago, you
should always
keep a listof
ten names in

of the top-
recruits in the country, middle
hitter Jennie Driscoll.

“Some people question how
you could turn down offers
from Stanford, Northwestern
and Illinois. I never saw it like
that,” Driscoll said. “I knew
Cindy-Braziel. I was really

gone and Driscoll sat out the
season after shoulder surgery.
The other four rookies stepped
in well enough for Pitt to
regroup and win the Big East
title again. One thing that sea-
son did was set up high expec-
tations for 1993, when the entire

happens that Cindy’s name was
on the top and she said yes.”
Braziel said she had been

anxious to be a head coach, but -
. having Woodstra leave was bit-

tersweet. ,
“I wanted the job,” Braziel
said in July. “This is great. Sue

. can I hire you as my assis-
tant”’ _ r A
‘Braziel ended up bringing in
former Nebraska assistant coach
Brian Begor to take that job.
Those changes so close to the
opening of preseason practice
left Pitt with a tough transition.
“I’m not going to lie and say

‘ there weren’t problems because

there were,” Lucanie said. “It
was a big adjustment. Cindy
was also thrown into the situa-
tion pretty late, too. That affect-

ed us somewhat because it was

pretty rushed.”

Braziel said the timing was
the only reason the transition
was a problem.

“I didn’t have a chance to be
organized,” Braziel said. “Brian,
coming in two days before pre-
season, hadgno chance to be
organized. Our kids had no
time ‘to adapt to a new staff and
a new system. It has been very
uncomfortable to changethis
quickly with the same expecta-
tions over our heads.” '

The Panthers adjusted
enough to go 23-9 in an up-and-

18-O. Pitt has never —- not
once — lost to St. Francis in
men’s basketball.

Okay, so the Red Flash is not
North Carolina or Duke or even
Memphis St. But in the history
of the two schools, St. Francis
has never done as much as sur-
prised the Panthers in an early-
season overlooker.

Pretty impressive?

“No, I don’t think that’s a big
deal,” Pitt assistant coach Norm
Law said. “Each game is individ-
ual of the other, and you have
to play each game separately.”

The Red Flash (9-18 overall
last season) will have their 19th
shot tonight at 8 p.m. when they
enter the still-warming
Fitzgerald Field House — a
pla_ce where they are O-11, hav-

ing lost by an average of 17.6
points ‘—— to take on 1-0 Pitt.

Led by senior forward Deon
George, ‘St. Francis operates a
style of offense vastly different
from the Panthers’ bang—it-
inside, Big East philosophy.

“They’re smaller than us and
they’ll make our big" guys play,”
Law said. “They run a lot of
motion and make our big guys

work, so that might be a prob- _

lem for [center] Eric [Mobley],
but if we play some D’ and get
the ball inside on offense we
should be OK.”

George, who averaged 18.3
points and 6.3 boards per game
last season, returns as the Red
Flash’s leading scorer and
rebounder. He joins. senior for-

‘ ward Chris Temming (13.4 ppg,

5.9 rpg), who will be playing

protective face mask after frac-
turing it in practice. He also

the Russian Select Team. “Their

exhibition loses to Marathon Oil
and the Canadian National
Team. But, as would be expect-
ed after beating a much weaker
team, the Panthers are not hold-
ing the win as inspiration to 
them through the season.

“They weren’t a very good
team but there’s nothing like a
win to help the confidence,”
Law said. “We got some of the
younger guys in there to play a
little so that’s got to help their
confidence, too.”

Despite the obvious differ-
ence in the two programs —— Pitt
went to the NCAA Tournament

ished nine games under .500 —

Continued from page 7
down season. Pitt dominated
the conference again in the reg-
ular season, but had to battle to
pull out a ﬁve-game conference
championship match against
Seton Hall. They play at George
Washington in the first round of

the NCAA tournament tonight.
Lucanie is currently playing to
extend her career. When Pitt’s
season ends, so does her career
after three Big East Player of the

Year awards and a possible All-.

American selection this season.

Even as Lucanie leaves, she is
an inﬂuence on the future of the
program.

“You see one athlete come
through the program and be
successful and athletes start
looking.” Lucanie said. “If this
person went there, there must
be something good happening
here.” ‘

Pitt has pushed Lucanie for
All-American status. The
Panthers have never had one,
but Braziel said Lucanie has a
good chance.

“When kids open up
Volleyball Monthly and see the
All—American list and there is a
kid from Pittsburgh — you can’t
beat that kind of publicity,”
Braziel said. “It makes you rep-
utable as a coach. It means you
train great athletes well. It

9

opens up a whole new recruit-
ing realm.

“[Ifl a kid says, ‘I want to be
an All—American,’ land I say that]
we’ve never had one  We’re
not going to get that kid.”

Three things that also affect
recruiting are the major con-
cerns for Braziel in Pitt’s future
— the Big East itself, facilities
and marketing. “

Braziel said that Pitt cannot
make the next step to the top 10
level with the Big East as it is.

“The conference is a hin-
drance more than a help for us
moving forward. The best ath-
letes are not impressed by the
fact that we’ve won six Big East
championships in a row,”
Braziel" said. “The best athletes
will say, ‘I can go to UCLA and
play a top 15 team every other
week, or I could come to
Pittsburgh and thump people
and never get any recognition.”

Braziel and Sprague both

Cindy Braziel came to Pitt in 1991 as an assistant coach.

women’s sports, particularly
women’s volleyball, which has
established itself as such a high-
priority women’s sport,” Collier
said.
Sprague said that most

schools do not comply with
Title IX, but that is changing.

“If you look at the recent
court cases, it is clear that is not
acceptable any more,” Sprague
said. “With gender equity, ath-

'1

letic departments across the
Country are making bigger com-
mitments to women’s pro-
grams.”

A recent twist to the problem
is the other Big East schools
pushing for the conference to
go to a double round-robin reg-
ular season schedule, which is
how 12 of the 24 conferences in
women’s volleyball play their
regular seasons. The Big East
teams only play each other once
a season.

“We don’t think the confer-
ence is ready for that, because
of the disparity of resources in
the volleyball programs in the
Big East conference,” Sprague
said. “It would tie the better
schools and the schools that are
trying to get [better] in knots in
terms of scheduling.”

Sprague said that the double
round robin is coming, as is a
slow improvement of the rest of
the conference.

A question for Pitt is if the
same can be said for fans. While
some of the top programs (such
as Nebraska, UCLA and
Wisconsin) draw thousands of
fans to each match, the Panthers
have continued to be severely
lacking in fan support, failing at
times to out-draw even, their

conference opponents.

“I think it impacts on every-
thing,” Begor said. “I think it
impacts on recruiting. A recruit
 goes to one campus and
there are 30 People 1“ the
crowd and they go to another
campus and there are 4,500.

That has a p1‘€ttY big impact-"
Begor also said that fan sup-
port is impoitant for the athletes

 

already in the programt.

Pitt’s facilities also effect
recruits and current players. The
days of matches at Trees Hall
are in the past, but the team still
practices there often.

“We need to be training on
our home court more than the

visiting team is,” Braziel said. ‘.‘It -

wall and thefloor is stained.
You’ve got to function on that
level all the way around, not
just scholarships, [but also] in
media, in facilities  you need
to be proud of what you have.”
Sprague said that she hoped
the volleyball program could
have its locker room and train-

‘ ing facility at Fitzgerald Field

House once the planned convo-
cation center is built. She said
that Trees Hall should be
improved for the time being.

Braziel said the team also
needs a stable coaching staff.

“You recruit the kind of kids
you know you can coach,”
Braziel said. “The program takes
on your personality. Once that
happens, you maintain that
more than create it. This year
we did a lot of creating. That is
difficult on the coaching staff
and the kids.”

Braziel and Begor both said

“I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t
convinced that great things
could happen here,” Begor said.
“It’s an exceptional university.
Y'ou should be able to draw
exceptional student athletes.”

Getting those top athletes is a
key for Pitt to succeed.
\Woodstra’s departure changes
Pitt’s recruiting style, but that
area is Braziel’s strength.

“A lot of recruiting is working
your butt off and being some-
one the kids can relate to and
having a successful program,”
Braziel said. “The top 10 teams
repeatedly draw those top kids.
For a program like Pittsburgh,
we have to get one blue chipper
every three or four years.”

Braziel is working on next
year’s incoming class as she
prepares her current teamfor
the NCAA tournament. She said
that the Panthersalready lost
out Aon one of its top prospects,
but is still in the hunt for three

other players they want to sign.

Nov. 29 edition of The
Washington Post. Senior
Jen Smuck retumed to the
team this season after
going through three
months of chemotherapy
for cancer.

Then in September, as
the team prepared for a
road trip to Florida,_the
parents of rookie Heather
McNab were killed when
their train rolled off a
bridge near Mobile, Ala.

‘‘It was almost a feeling
like, ‘What else can hap-

coach Susie Holman told
The Washington Post,

The Colonials lost two

- of the matches in Florida,

but have not lost since, a
21-match winning streak.
The match will be the
first ever NCAA tourna-
ment match for the
Colonials. Pitt has been
there four straight times.
Pitt’s top hitter and only
senior, Ann Marie
Lucanie, has extra incen-
tive as she takes the court,
but it is a positive one.
“I’ve never been in a
situation where I’ve
