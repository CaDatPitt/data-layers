All Candidates
Are Unopposed

Motion Passed to Consider New
Druid Plan for Freshmen ~

   

Giving its first official expression of
uniﬁed strength, a new Student Coun-
cil took over the reigns of self-goverm
ment Wednesday night and elected
all officers and committee chairmen
without opposition, nominations in
every case being closed by a unani-
pmous vote.

Jack McFarland, Dent. '34, was
elected to succeed President Reed P.
Rose, Dent. '33, and after a brief mess-
age in which he pledged himself to
an efficient administration, opened
the meeting for discussion of the
Druid plan of freshman regulations.

Other officers nominated and elect-
ed without opposition were James
Danahey, Col. '34, vice president;
Dorothy Lewis, Ed. '34, secretary (re-
elected), and Bernard Curran,
Mines '34, treasurer.

The same system of nominating one
candidate and immediately closing
nominations held throughout the elec-
tion of the -six council committee chair-
men. Members elected to these posts
on the ballot of Secretary Dorothy
Lewis were Ray Mo-Cune, Eng. '34,
Student Relations Committee; Rich-
ard Wettach, Bus. Ad. '34, Elections
Committee; Scott Turner, Eng. '35.
Investig.ation Committee; George Roll,
Ed, '34, Assemblies Committee; Jules
Greveii, Col. '35, Traditions Committee,
and Paul M. Baker, Bus. Ad. '35, Con-
stitution Committee.

McParland, who was elected senior
representative from the Dental School
in the recent election, is the fourth
successive dental student to hold the
presidency of Student Council. A
member of Delta Tau Delta, social
fraternity, Psi Omega, dental frater-
nity, and Omicron Delta Kappa, hon-
orary activities fraternity, McFarland
has seen service in a number of di-
versiﬁed campus‘ organizations.

During the past year he served as a
member of Student Relations Com-
mittee of Student Council and as a
member of the Junior Prom Commit-
tee. In his sophomore year McPar-
land held the presidency oQDruids,
honorary activities fraternity for
sophomore men, and was chairman of
the Soph Hop Committee.

The Druid plan for instructing in-
coming freshmen in University tradi-
tions, songs, football yells, and activi-
ties was discussed at some length by
the new body. ,

A motion ﬁnally was passed author-
izing the executive committee of Stu-
dent Council, with the chairman of
Traditions Committee, to meet with
Druids at its next meeting and clar-
ify the details of the plan. Council,
the motion also provided, will have a.
special meeting to acquaint itself
with the approved program,

Past-president Rose, in welcoming
the members, stressed the importance
of the new members accepting their
responsibilities as duties apart from
the “activities” world. He said:

_ “Student Council is not an activity.
For most of you it will be a. job. ‘My
advice to you would be to use common
sense, rather than to cling to the high-
est of unattainable ideals. ‘
materially, or you will be lost in a
maze of quibbling. And remember that
although you can do some good, you

can't’ expect to dig the roots out of’,

everything in one year."

Arthur Goldberg,-. Col. '33, retiring
senior representative, had some addi-
tional advice for the new members: '

“There are two alternatives which
this group —~ a so-called ‘coalition
council’—may follow in the coming,
year. You may sit back and do noth-
ing for the general student body, or,
being uniﬁed, you may take the rest
of the University into your activity.
I would urge you to take the,non-
fraternity group into consideration:
do something for these unorganized
students who have little of the Uni-
versity life you enjoy through fra-
ternities. -

“Be the loudspeaker for the stu-
dent body, for you can do and say
things thatwouldl be‘ frowned on out-
side of Council. Members of Council
need not be afraid of the administra-
tion or any such divisions of it as
are represented by Heinz House, And
in this connection I would urge the
women representatives to exercise
their power in legislating. for women."

Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of
men, reviewing Council activities of
the past year, had a brief word of
praise for the group's accomplish-
ments. '

Schramm Talks
011 Child Courts

Inquiry Speaker Outlines Reme-
dial Steps for Delinquents

 

“Possibilities of the Juvenile Court

are as yet undeveloped and many are
probably unthought of," declared Dr.

Gustave L. Schramm, asso.ci_ate pro—[

fessor of political science, before the
lnquiry Forum ‘W'ednesday after-noon,
He spoke on “The Juvenile Court.”

The Inquiry speaker outlined the

children's court system in Allegheny
county, showing the relation of the
organization to the county court.
“The old jails,” -he commented, “were
a school for crime. Yet today delin-
quents are younger than ever."

Dr. Schramm pointed out four rem-
edial measures adopted
The ﬁrst -en-
tails keeping the child at home after.

.a ;'.9Jjl1'll1li3.l1(l, the second involves send-

ing him to a foster home. In the .third.
instance, he is transferred to an op-
porlu-nity school, and ‘for most serious
delinquencies, is sent to such an in-

~stiI..u;t.ion as M-orga=_nza.

"The greatest difficulty with the
plan," asser1.e.d -the political science
professor, “lies in the ;foster home
plan. There is only one investigator
tor e~v:ery 100 I'0ste1' homes in the
county. Naturally he cannot keep a
close check upon these places.”

"11’ ~Gov.e1-ii-or Pinchot signs the new
-hill,” he continued, juvenile court
judggges will, .eft'ective January 1, take

oflice. for a full ten-yea-1' term, thus

i-aiikiiig with other branches of our
-judicial systeni. Possibly th.e_gii.eatest
advantage in the juvenile court is that
it. may stimulate better -treatment of
adults in our courts.”

'‘‘‘'‘In those days, a man named Wellinan,

to ‘keep the ﬂavor fine and mellow.

"Well, sir, the people who make this
Grziiiger ‘-R-o-ugh Cut acquired Mr.

‘known how the old boys used to wliittle
their tobacco to make it smoke cool. Yes,
sir, this ..Gr.a1_1ger is the real stuff. The
same mcllowness and fine ﬂavor that
Wcllmaii used to hand out to his friends.
A.1i,r1. ifs whittled into big sliaggy ﬂakes

is imposed for every day they are
over dlle. A record is kept of all
those rented, and if one. is not re-
turned, a card is sent ollt, giving the
number of the umbrella and the date
it was taken out. A request is sent
to call at the health ofﬁce if it is lost,
so that an adjustment may be made.

’l‘he money received from this
rental service is used to buy new um-
brellas and to keep others in repair.
In addition, it is devoted to the care
of women who need medical~atten-
tion, besides that given by the office,

furnish additional ' nourishment to
women who are in need. Dr. Jamison
is particularly interested in this phase
of the fund and urges that any woman
,who is receiving insufficient nourish-
! ment should arrange with her for get-
ting lunch money. If these aids can
be repaid they will be treated as a
loan from the fund. In the case of
women unable to repay, the office is
still anxious to assist them and urges
that these women should call and
make arrangements at the office.

It is estimated that in the fall sixty
umbrellas went out daily, but since
it has been raining in the morning
when women left their homes for
school, only six or seven have been
rented a. day.

Business Administration
Alumni Elects Officers
The School of Busilless Adminis-

tration Alumni Association held its
annual meeting May 5, at which time

the officers for the coming week were"

elected. The officers elected are:
President, Eric. Johnson; first vice
president, Joseph Scllewe; second vice
president, Charles L, Garson, J1‘.; and
secretary-treasurer, E. A. Batchelder.
The three icpreselltatives elected to
the General Alumni Council are: ‘Wil-

, ll;-‘llll C. Arthur, Nornian MacLeod and
lGeorge I. Carson. The Board of Gov-

' ernors will consist of R. A. McCrady,

John B. Nicklas, J1-., Nellie Jones, J,
G. Quick, Ulhard Hangartner, Jason
 Stone. Jr.,- C. R. Vlfilson, W. H.
Ma.rk11s, C. E, Hastings and Severin
Kenah.

Approxiinatcly seventy-ﬁve mem-
bers of the association attended the
meeting‘, during which Dr. Marion K.
).'IcKay. }31‘()feSS0l' of economics, gave
a. talk on ‘'‘Taxation in Pennsylvania,”
and Dr. J. Paul Vvatson, assistant pro-
fessor of Economic Research, spoke
on “Governmental Expenditure and
some ;VIa.jol- Problems in Budgetary
Reductions.”

ND another organization succumbs to the key craze. The College

Association, campus group whose chief function in the past has
been to sponsor two dances each semester and let things go at that,
alters its by-laws to permit the awarding of keys to ofﬁcers and
cabinet members. A

Service as an officer of the association for one year or member-
ship in the cabinet for two years are the requirements which must
be met before a student may be permitted to lay claim to this newly
created chest adornment. Added to these are the provisions that
the key candidates must have attended at least three—fourths of the
cabinet meetings and discharged their responsibilities with a reason-
able amount of efficiency.

The reason advanced for introducing the key award system into
the College Association was the one usually applied at such a time.
It is expected to encourage a needed interest among the members
of the association c.a.b.inct.

jut since present senior members of the cabinet will not have
an opportunity to fulﬁll these requirements, eleven gradllating
members were graciously voted keys. Apparently this action was
justiﬁcd on the basis of past service rendered by the out-going in-
dividuals.

Hearing this latest endorsement of a practice which is fast as-
suming the proportions of a racket on the University campus, one
wonders where the thing is going to end. Must we believe that
nothing is to be expected ‘by way of service from glorified dance
committees without I_‘eward‘.~’ Perhaps the Senior Ball connnittce and
all similar groups next year might be persuaded to join the parade.
Such an event would not be surprising in the light of this most re-
cent development.

There is little enough rea..=;on for the existence of an organiza-
tion which has feigned to represent one school of the University and
consistently embraced the entire student body in its sole activity,
without turning it into another key-chaser’s club.

If there is not el1Oll1,.0,'ll interest among the students of the College
to carry on what little work there is to be done in the association
without being paidoﬁ’ in enamel and lettered gold, there probably is
not enough interest to warrant continuing the organization in its

jpresent» status. If the reason for -making what amounts to an un-

complimentary award is that of encouragin.g future interest, there
is no excuse for spending money on incumbent members. Such an
action, if considered at all, should have been left to next year’s ox-
ecutive committee.

Commendable, indeed, is the cabinet’s proposal to sponsor at
least one assembly for College stuclcnts next year. In this direction
should lie the interests of a group which is theoretically designed: to
bring students of a single school together. There is no raising of
the a.sso'ciation’s standards in such self-gloriﬁcation as the key racket
inva.r.'lably indicates.

l

T

‘a‘arom.en’s 'room‘hzis"been long "apparent. The University, being a
school whose buildings are spread"over,.§a large" area,‘ oﬁier-is little‘ op-
portunity to women who, having.a_frec_'hour.,or two, find the Alumni
Hall benches or the even less adequate facilities of the Cathedral a
poor place to spend it. i  '_ ‘ ' _ ‘A ~‘ - 

As well as the women, the direc,tors.of -_S.l;l1(l(?l‘lt publications
will welcome this innovation. For certainly “the coed problem”
in publications offices was not through a choice of the editors and
business managers. Since last fall the News has advocated the
establ.isllm.ent of such facilities.

This change meets a need. But there still remains the need for
zl. similar room in Alumni Hall, the distance between the hill build-
ings where most classes are held and the‘ Cathedral being a great
one. A fair view, however, brings to mind the present crowded con-
dition of Alumni, and the impossibility of 3. smoking room there
until further completion of the Fifth avenue building absorbs a
greater share of classes.

A Needed Improvement

_ What has been done for the women should, at an early and rea-
sonable time, be done for the men. Present conditions do not point
to the completion of the Cathedral in the very near future. Hence,
we cannot defer the provision of smoking and lounging facilities in
either the Cathedral or other campus buildings because of present
plans for the all-too-distant future.

of the -Cathedral will‘ be good-news to coeds.“ The. need ‘for slléilli '

The modern trend in architecture,
which has produced such buildings as
those on display at the World's Fair
in Chicago, is represented and ex-
plained by imported reproductions and
books on exhibition in the library of
the Fine Arts department, State Hall,
The exhibit, which opened May 8 and
will continue until May 17, illustrates
functionalism ‘and the ferro-concrete
style, along with the theories of Le
Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, per-
helps the greatest of American archi-
tects, Gropius and others.

Functionalism and the ferro-con-
crete style have been made possible
through modern methods of construc-
tion. Oif-set arches, which were im-
possible with the old, stone block
method of building, is now a simple
matter of structural steel and cement.

The theory of functionalism holds
that a building should be built to il-
lustrate the use for which it is in-
tended. For instance, an art gallery
should be so designed that no one in
passing it would mistake it for a. can-
ning factory, 'or‘ vice" versa.

The designs produced by this new
movement are "characterized by sim-
plicity. _As no ornamental designs
quite applicable to the new style have
yet been drawn up, the buildings are
plain.

In forming this new school of ar-
chitecture, the artists have complete-

iy ignored the existence of classical
forms such.-as Gothic, Greek, Roman
and the like, and the result has been
a pleasing simplicity of form, re-
strained enough to prevent the feel-
ing of nausea that one often gets when
viewing “modern art.”

This new form of expression in ar-
chitecture has its ‘practical applica-
tion also. The new buildings provide
an elasticity of design impossible with
the old conventional forms. There is
no need now for balancing a column
with a column, a wing with a wing,
and the result when the buildings are
set on the side of a hill, is more sat-
isfactory than any designs yet em-
ployed. Also. the cost of constructing
this new type of building is consider-
ably less than, present construction
costs for the ordinary design of build-
ing and offers the additional advant-
age of added light.

It is in Germany, where a housing
shortage resulted soon after the war,
that this new form_ of architecture
has had its practical expression,

’though most of'the theories’ have

come from F1-allce. Almost every
large city on the continent has its
section containing examples of this
new movement in architecture, which
should, in time, at least, gain the
prestige of classical forms, and per-
haps will even supplantvall previous
modes of architectural expression.

Louise E. Mcliirdy, Col. '36, has
been chosen for-the -lead of» “Fol-

presentation.

Miss McKirdy will portray the char-
acter of Lucinda, a spinster. Virginia
Raskin, Col. ’36, who has been cast
opposite her, will ha.ve the only male
part in the play. She will enact the
role of Mr. Redfern, the spurned sweet-

Helen, who scoffs at Lucinda/s old-
fashioned idea, will be acted by Fran-
ces Geraldine Goodwin, Col. ’36, Velva
La Rue Seyler, Col, ’36, is Susan, the
maid.

The story deals with the life of a
spinster, who, in her youth, refused
