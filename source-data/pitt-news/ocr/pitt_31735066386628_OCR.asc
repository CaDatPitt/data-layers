The Black Action Society will hold a march and rally
on Thursday, Dec. 6 to protest a lack of student
representation on the presidential—search committee.

“We hope to be demonstrating students’ demands for
more representation and that we are not being demoralized
by [presidential—search committee Chairperson Farrell]
Rubenstein’s and [Board of Trustees Chairperson John]
Marous’s refusal to give us adequate representation.
Students are not going to stop fighting. We are going to
continue to fight the issue in the public eye to get more

Chairperson Justin Laing said.

The BAS action comes after Marous and Rubenstein
missed a Nov. 21 BAS deadline to contact the BAS to talk
about more representation. Laing said since the 21st he
has spoken to Rubenstein, but “Rubenstein and Marous

step.”

“The march is to keep the issue in the public eye and
to put pressure on the university to listen to us and sit
down and talk about more representation,” Laing said. “It

Area students
to protest Gulf
War possibility

By Dana Fernandez

and Jeff Tatusko
T be Pitt News

In an attempt to get U.S. troops out of
Saudi Arabia, about 30 people met in the
Cathedral ofLearning yesterday to plan an
anti-war demonstration.

The rally, scheduled for Friday, will
encompass students from six universities
including Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and
Duquesne. A march is expected to run
between Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, starting
at 1 p.m. at the William Pitt Union.

Amanda Johnston, a member of the
Central American Peace Coalition, is
heading the student movement at Pitt. She
said that her main goal for the march is to
get the American troops out of the Middle
East. ‘

“Nothing is worth the kind of war that
will be waged in the Middle East,” she
said. “lt’s going to take a lot of American
lives. We have to criticize the administration
for their ideas.” She also said that many
lives of those who live in the region would
be disrupted.

Johnston said that the Bush
administration is too dependent on Kuwaiti
resources. “[Wel aren't there to protect

Study claims Kuwaiti Emir violates human rights

By Donna Terrell
Staf/'W'r1'ter

The ousted Emir of Kuwait should free
people in his own country before the
United States risks war to restore him to

‘his throne, said a group_ protesting

Operation Desert Shield last night in front
of the William Pitt Union.

Members of the Schiller Institute,

comprised of supporters for the
incarcerated Lyndon Larouche and a team
of investigative reporters, wanted students
and passersby to sign a petition to get
Congress to investigate allegations of Emir
Jaber’s slave-holding practices.

The Schiller Institute unveiled the
findings of its investigative team at an
emergency meeting at Cleveland State
University two weeks ago.

The 42-page report titled Does Cbattel
Slavery Exist In Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
and other Gulf states? was written by
Webster Tarpley. Tarpley is the head of
the investigative unit of the Schiller Institute
and editor of its publication called the
Executive Intelligence Report.

Tarpley calls the report “a first attempt
to assemble excerpts from relevant
documentation that may help U. S. public

opinion, and in particular, elected members
of the United Stated Congress, to build an
increasing awareness of the slavery issue
as it regards Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf.”

Information contained in the report is
based primarily on reports from journalists,
travelers and books written on the topic of
slavery.

Activist on week-long ‘juice fast’ at SEI

Runway collision kills 20

A jet bound for Pittsburgh collided with another plane
yesterday at Detroit’s Metropolitan Airport, killing at least 20
people and injuring 50.

Northwest Flight 1482, a DC-9 bound for Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport, was taxiing on a runway when the wing
of Northwest Flight 299 headed for Memphis, Tenn., scraped
against the rear portion of the fuselage.

The fuselage of the DC-9 apparently exploded, engulfing the
plane in flames. All of the fatalities were on the Northwest ﬂight.
'¥ Both planes were apparently converging onto the same

runway at the time. The DC-9, which held 39 passengers and

five crew members, suffered most of the casualties but there
were some casualties on the Boeing 727 carrying 146 people.
' Apparently the runway had been wet from an earlier snowfall,
and dense fog was rolling into the area at the time of the
accident, about 1:45 p.m., Eastern time. The 727 had been
cleared for takeoff on the runway, but the pilot of the DC-9 was
apparently lost in the dense fog and had given the control tower
,, wrong information about his where-abouts. The ﬂight had
originated in Chicago and had stopped in Detroit on its way to
Pittsburgh when the accident occurred. ___je17 Tamsko

began a week-long vigil and “juice
fast” yesterday in front of Came gie
Mellon’s Software Engineering
Institute to protest SE1 ’s research
work for ‘the Department of
Defense.

“SEI does the software research
for many weapons used by the
U.S. military, some of which is in
[Operation] Desert Shield,” Eirene
said, sitting inside a Second—Mile
Light Hauling moving van to get
dry from the rain on Monday.
“This week marks the five—day
countdown to the sixth
anniversary that SEI has been
open and working, and we are
also tying in [Operation] Desert
Shield.” ,

While staying outside SE1, he
will “juice” fast, drinking only
fruit juices or vegetable broth the

stop at SE1 on Friday. Eirene feels
this is inspiring because more
and more students are showing a
concern for what is going on in
the world.

He also said that he has done
nothing to make this happen, this
is an independent action, with
him having no input.

Also throughout the week,
weather permitting, Eirene said
he will be burning a white candle
to symbolize what he believes to
be “a light of hope amidst avast
darkness.” Vigils as a form of
protest have a special purpose
for Eirene.

Terry McGillen, public—affairs

of Eirene’s claims are untrue.

“Eirene is inaccurate. We do
meet the Department of Defense’s
needs in various projects.
However, the research done in
software is not going to the

Eirene disagrees.

“Napoleon once said that

Coping on campus...
Chase those holiday blues away with positive thinking

The holiday season is almost
here, and most students greatly
anticipate this welcome break.
Classes are winding down, and
exams will soon be over. Holiday
music can already be heard, and
images of happy faces, gift-
exchanging and warm embraces
flow from the media. It is a time
of great excitement, high
anticipation and fond memories
of holidays past.

It may also be a time of family
tension, intense disappointment
and the emergence of the holiday
blues. Students who may have
put their conflicts with family
aside in September sometimes
become demoralized to find that
they are spending their precious
holiday time in the middle of old
squabbles. Others may find it
difficult to resume their old roles
in the family and to once again
submit to the authority of their
parents.

Loneliness is also a common
experience during the holidays.

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

Since our culture programs us for
romance and togetherness during
this time of year, we can easily
feel like failures if we don’t have
loving partners to share the
holiday with. The loneliness can
be intense, especially if one has
experienced a recent loss such as
the death of a family member or

 

friend or a broken relationship.

One of the things you can do to
ward off the holiday blues is to
maintain a more realistic view of
what to expect. Anticipate the
home tensions you might
encounter and plan in advance
how you might minimize them.
Expect, for example, some of
your old adolescent conflicts with
your parents to emerge. Plan new
strategies for responding to these
conﬂicts.

If you anticipate that loneliness
will be a problem, plan ways to
help you cope with that
possibility. Make up your mind
to call old friends, and plan some

enjoyable activities. Take the

initiative, rather than hoping for
someone to call you or waiting
around for something interesting
to happen.

Also, remember that the most
effective blues—chaser of all is to
get outside yourself and do
something for somebody else.
Call an old teacher or some other

’ nrra prrr NEWS, Tuesday,December 4, 1990

person that inspired or supported
you in the past, and tell them

how much they meant to you._

Tell someone close to you that
you love them. Find someone
lonelier or needier than you and
offer them a helping hand or a
little encouragement. Make the
old truism “it’s better to give than
to receive” work for you.

You might also want to take
some time during the holidays to
reflect on the quality of your life.
If you are not happy with that
quality, resolve to change it. Henry
David Thoreau once wrote, “I
know of no more encouraging
fact than the unquestionable
ability of man to elevate his life
by conscious endeavor.”

Take hope from T horeau’s
words. Think about how you
might elevate your life. Read an
inspirational book. Psych yourself
UP- .

Convince yourself that the best
is yet to come, and commit
yourself to making it happen.

Futurisitic Handmaid 's Tale raises contemporary questions

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staff Writer

The women’s studies program
sponsored a screening and a panel
discussion of the contemporary
feminist issues raised in The
Handmaid's Tale, the movie
based on Margaret Atwood’s
novel, last Thursday evening.

The three speakers were
Marianne Novy, associate
professor of English; Susan
Hansen, associate professor of
political science; and Patrice
Fleck, a doctoral candidate in the
English department. Lucy Fisher
from the film studies department
moderated the discussion.

Atwood’s novel is about Gilead,
a society torn by war. Only one in
100 women is fertile, and the
“New Right” that rules the republic
forces fertile women to become
handmaids and carry children for
the families in control.

“By imagining the pervasively
institutionalized male dominance
in Gilead, Atwood has synthesized
her concern with women’s
personal empowerment and
individual empowerment against
the repressive state,” said Novy.

Novy discussed Gilead in
relation to the history of women
and governmental oppression.

“Handmaids are required to
bear children for the state; in
some respects this situation could
be compared to that of any
woman who bears an unwanted
child because abortion is illegal,”
she said.

Novy also made the following
comparisons

. In Gilead women are punished
for reading, as were slaves in the
United States; handmaids must

renounce their names, as women
often do after marriage in our
culture and as slaves were forced
to do, and there is an
Underground Female Road to
help women escape Gilead,
similar to the Underground
Railroad which helped slaves
escape.

Hansen discussed the
reproductive policies of Gilead
in comparison to historical
reproductive policies.

“What struck me about this
film was the very heavy emphasis
on the coercive aspects of
population policy in this
imaginary dystopia of Gilead,”
she said.

Hansen considered the success
of various political efforts to
control population, citing both
positive and negative examples
of population control in the recent
past.

In 1950 Sweden’s low birth
rate prompted officials to give
incentives and bonuses for
couples with children and to
impose a tax on unmarried

people, said Hansen. She
considered this a positive
example.

As a negative example, Hansen
cited Nazi Germany's efforts to

control the population. The Nazis
offered incentives only for Aryans
who bore children and
disincentives for groups they
considered “unpure. ”

Hansen said that many of these

governmental efforts are met with
resistance, as they are in Gilead,
and may be unsuccessful as well.

“l’ve been looking at the impact
of state abortion restriction, and
it is an interesting phenomenon
to notice that states that pass the
most restrictive abortion
legislation have increased the
most in terms of birth rate and
had the greatest increase in
abortion rates as well,” said
Hansen.

Fleck analyzed the differences
between the novel and the film.

She said that although both
works deal with contemporary
feminist issues, the film is
stylistically very bourgeois, and

the emphasis of the film is
different than that of the book.

“[Atwood’sl critique of women’s
political apathy is censored. In its
place, the film foregrounds the
fundamentalist religious attitude
[also pervasive in the novel] as
the primary locus of blame,” she
said.

According to Fleck, the film
was not a success due in part to
its controversial nature. O

“This lukewarm reception
possibly suggests that the material
remains subversive enough to
discourage audiences even after
its translation into the glossier
genre of Hollywood film,” she
said.

Veterinary technician takes animals’ problems to heart

By Margaret Swisher
Staﬂ’ Writer

At the Pittsburgh Humane
Society, animals, not their owners,
are top priority. Tawny Kempa, a
veterinary technician, often
becomes upset with people and
their attitudes toward animals.

“Animals are more of a
commodity than a real thing,”
she said. “They’re something you
can dump when you get tired of
them."

Kempa has been working at
the Humane Society for over eight
years. At first she worked in the
kennels. Then a position for a

veterinary technician became
available, and with an associate’s
degree in animal technology,
Kempa was qualiﬁed. She has
been working as a veterinary
technician for the past three years.

“It always enrages me to hear
the reasons why people don’t
want their dog or a dog we have,”
Kempa said. Pointing to the
identiﬁcation tags on the metal
cages, she read, “‘We’re moving,
allergies, can’t be housebroken,
too big, too small, too submissive.’
The list goes on.”

Walking along the dog cages in
the main kennel, Kempa, wearing
jeans, sneakers and a white lab

coat with a missing button,
repeats some ofthe lame excuses
she has heard. “People tell you
it’s a stray when it’s their
daughter’s dog. A week later
their child comes in crying,
wanting [her] dog back.”

Kempa read more reasons off
the cages. “Killing the neighbor’s
chickens!’ What are they doing
letting you in the neighbor’s
yard?” she asked the cocker
spaniel. “‘No pets! Destructive!’
Another reason might be you're
a puppy,” she said smiling, petting
the German shepherd.

Looking at the cats, she noticed
a popular excuse. “jealousy of

the baby,”’ Kempa said, brushing
her ruffled blond hair off her
face. “I have two children, and
my cats have gotten used to it.”

Kempa enjoys working at the
Humane Society but prefers
working in the clinic to the
kennels. The workers in the
kennel interact with the animals
on a daily basis cleaning cages,
feeding the animals and putting
the animals to sleep. They also
have to deal with the people
who don’t want their pets and
with customers interested in
adopting an animal.

Kempa explained how
frustrating it is to work at the
kennel and deal with the people.
“The more you talk, the less
they listen. They blame you for
everything. They bring in a 9-
year—old dog. Nobody’s going
to want it.”

Kempa said the worst part of
her job is putting the animals to
sleep. Approximately 15,000 to
20,000 animals are destroyed
each year.

“It’s a lot of work for 10 kennel
people and two technicians to
handle,” Kempa said, bending
down to adjust a blanket under
a Doberman who has just been
spayed. “It’s very emotional to
put the animals to sleep.”

Animals can be destroyed
within hours, days or a week. It
all depends on how much room
is available in the kennels.

“If they seem healthy, we see
how many we can adopt out.
Pups and kittens sell themselves
because they’re so cute,” she
said.

EARCH IS NOW ON!
YLVANIA USA@ PAGEANT

For many years the Humane
Society used a decompression
chamber to put animals to sleep. A
decompression chamber removes
all the oxygen from the air.

“For years it was ﬁne. Now they
decide it’s not as humane as we
thought. Now we put them to
sleep by injecting them with an
overdose of a depressant. We then
put them into a cooler until the city
truck picks them up. We call it the
euthanasia room. You really don’t
want to see it.”

Kempa said her job is busiest
during the spring and summer
months.

“We get 700 to 800 cats a month,”
she said, ﬁlling the kittens’ water
container. “In the winter it gets
dark sooner, and they don’t breed
as much.”

She expressed anguish with some
owners who bring their dogs in to
be put to sleep. “Some take their
pet back to be buried. The others
get picked up by the city truck. I
sure wouldn’t want my pet shoved
in some landfill.”

All sorts of animals come into
the Humane Society,— including
birds, hamsters and ferrets, but no
snakes are allowed.

When it comes to the animals,
Kempa said she can’t help picking
out a favorite. “I usually adopt the
older animals, the ones nobody
wants. I adopted a yellow tabby
and two birds a few years ago.”

Since then Kempa hasn’t adopted
more animals. “Animals are too
social to be left home by
themselves,” she said.

At the clinic, which is above the
kennels, all the treatments and
operations are performed. When
Kempa makes her daily rounds,
she walks into the holding room,
where animals are kept for three
days, to see if they show any signs
of disease. It is her responsibility to
give them their shots, bathe and
care for them when they first arrive.

She smiles and talks in a high-
pitched, excited voice to all the
animals, rubbing each one on the
back or touching its nose. Kempa
explained the diverse needs of
animals she works on. '

“We even have pit bulls
sometimes,” she said. She also
explained that with certain dogs,

THE  NEWS, Tuesday, December 4, 1990

 

,KuWait

Continued from page 1

The reports contains an excerpt from an article
written by British author Germaine Greer titled
Our Allies, the Slave Holders published in the
Nov. 14 edition of The New Yorle Times. In the
article Greer questions “... our new friends, the
Kuwaitis, for whose national sovereignty we are

‘ prepared to die?”

Greer portrays the “beaming Emir of Kuwait
who has been given a standing ovation at the
United Nations ...” as the kinsman of a Sheika
who stole her servant passports, kept her prisoner
for four years and subjected her to daily
whippings.

The High Court awarded her 300,000 pounds
for damages last December, but Greer contends
that only the anti-slavery society acknowledges
this.

An interview with an American doctor is also
published in the report. The doctor, who lived in
Saudi Arabia from 1983 to 1985 likened the
slaves from Sudan to cats, saying “they wouldn’t
say a word. They would just crawl into a corner

and not say a word when they had performed
their assigned tasks.”

Tarpley admits that the report does not contain
the last word on slavery in the Gulf.

However, it does, in his opinion, “provide
sufficient material to motivate the investigation
we are calling for.”

Constance Komm, of the Schiller Institute, said
the report would be especially alarming to
African Americans since it claims that a majority
of the chattel slaves are from Africa. Komm
questions whether or not African Americans
should be fighting to defend a country that
allows slavery to exist.

Demonstrator’s signs telling people to “just say
no to war” did not please some students. One
passing student asked how we could stop
something that has not begun.

Pitt economics and Japanese—studies student,
Matt Chase, questioned the need for anti-war
demonstrations saying that if “their actions make
our oil prices really high we have a right to be
there.”

is broad representation on the
search committee, even though
there is only one student on and
she was selected
undemocratically.

“It seems the students are
uniformly for more
representation, but they don’t
know how to go about it. We feel
as though this is a way to get all
students involved,” Laing said.

Laing said that many people
have the mistaken impression
that this is a black student issue.

“The Student Government
Board didn't do anything to
defend the students, so we are
doing it, and now people are
thinking that we are making it a

gblack/white issue, [but] we are

doing this for everybody.
Hopefully everybody will get
involved in this, so that we can
show people that this is not just
a black/white issue,” Laing said.

“I would just like to stress that
it is not a black student issue and
that students should not feel as
though BAS is making some kind
of aggressive move toward white
people or anything like that. We
‘want all students to get involved

with this because the president is
going to affect things like tuition,
student fees and the amount of

money that goes to the
undergraduate‘ faculty and
research,” he said.

Some people have

misinterpreted the wording of
the BAS speech at the open
student hearing for the
presidential-search committee,
Laing said. The statement read,

“We urge the search committee

and whomever else is responsible
for making the necessary changes
to contact us by Nov. 21, 1990, 12
noon, because if the issue is not
dealt with by this time, the chances
of solving this problem orderly
and peacefully will decline
drastically.”

The wording of the statement
was not intended to suggest
violenc, according to Laing.

“The original wording of the
statement was not intended to
suggest violence, but because
we worded it ambiguously, it
allowed people to say that we
were going to be violent. People
are quick to say that a group like
the BAS is going to be violent. In
our definition violence is outright

and

—— us attacking someone, and we
had never had that in mind,”
Laing said.The wording meant
that if the deadline was missed,
the BAS would take "action" on
the matter, in contrast to doing
things like letter writing and
making phone calls, Laing said.
Laing said that the BAS will
continue to fight for
representation on the search
committee after the march.
“This won't be the last action
we are taking until we win, and
we plan to. We will go right
down to the wire because we
refuse to let the trustees and the
university treat us this way. So
there will be no last action; we
are not stopping. If we really
want this, then we will just con-
tinue until we get it,” Laing said.

dependent on Kuwaiti oil. We

It’s just causing the economic

Many people from various
student groups are also
participating in the march.
Stephanie Helsel, co—president of
the Campus Women’s Organ-
ization,‘ said that she att—ended
the meeting for personal reasons.

“I’m here as a concerned
student,” she said. “The CWO
hasn’t officially taken a position
on the situation yet.” She also
said that she did expect some
members from the group to attend
the rally.

“A war is not going to solve
anything,” she said. “Many people
will be killed. An embargo is a
much better way to get the point
across to [Saddam Husseinl.” A

A Students will not be the only

ones taking part in the rally. Allan
Canfora, one of the students who
was shot during the Kent State
incident in 1972, will be speaking
at Pitt for the event.

Gary Doebler, a member of
Pittsburgh’s “Remember Kent
State Committee,” said that he is

concerned about the freedom of . -

the soldiers in the war effort. “A
free society can’t go to war and
keep its freedom at home,” he
said. “The first casualties of war
are truth, freedom and justice.”
Doebler also said that he did
not want to see a repeat of Kent
State, where four people died in
a confrontation with National
Guardsmen during a protest.
The march will start at the
William Pitt Union and proceed
to the CMU ROTC building. It will
then go to the Software
Engineering Institute at CMU and
finally end up back at Pitt.

Say no to the dmfl‘...

During the Vietnam conflict the U.S. government
instituted a military draft in order to get enough troops
into what ended up as a no-win situation. Now the Bush
administration is doing the same thing, as it is considering
another draft if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf.

The situation in the region is tenuous at best. One wrong
move by either side could start a bloodyiwar in which
thousands of people will be killed. The United Nations
has recently upped the ante, giving the Iraqis until Jan. 1 S
to pull out of Kuwait before “use all necessary means”
sanctions go into effect. .

Originally, the United States sent some 230,000 troops
to Saudi Arabia in an effort to defend that country from
further Iraqi aggression. After that, however, it became an
offensive situation for .the Bush administration, and it sent
an additional 200,000 troops.

On the other side, the United States is facing upwards
of 400,000 Iraqi troops within Kuwait itself. An offensive
effort by the United States will take a large amount of
ground and air support and will take thousands of
casualties in order to succeed.

instituting a draft, however, is not the answer. Sending
trained, professional volunteers into an armed conflict is

A one thing. Drafting -young men involuntarily, training

them in the most basic methods of warfare and sending
them into a battle in which they might not want to fight
is completely another.

Kuwait is approximately the size of New jersey. The
Iraqis already have hundreds of thousands of troops

‘ there. By sending in an offensive troop movement, the

administration should have the confidence in its regulars
to carry out this assignment. ‘ '

If the United States is so desperate for troops, then it
should draw from its own reserves. There are places in the
world where U.S. troops are not engaged in defensive
maneuvers. There are many places in this country where
military forces could be used in Saudi Arabia. The U.S.
government should highly consider taking forces from
these resources rather than instituting a draft.

This prospective draft would also contradict the
diplomatic solution which the United Nations is trying so
desperately to negotiate. Economic sanctions have only
been in. place for a little over four months — hardly
enough time for them to have any sizable impact. An
offensive and subsequent draft would mean that the
United States is giving up on the United Nations and
taking matters into its own hands.

By sending a young man into a war in which he may or
may not want to fight is not an effective way for the
administration to boost its country’s morale and support.

Losing Kuwait...

Soldiers need our support for morale

Ladies and gentlemen, I think
it’s about time we buckle down
and get ready for action. Like it
or not, there’s a really good
chance that we’re going to war.

Last week, the United Nations’
Security Council voted 12-2 (with
China abstaining) to use “all
necessary means” to get Saddam
Hussein's forces out of Kuwait.
This vote, which the United States
was ferociously seeking, means
that military force will be
sanctioned by the United Nations.
Seeing as President Bush is
sending an additional 150,000 to
200,000 American troops on the
way to the Persian Gulf, things
aren’t looking so good for Mr.
Hussein; 0

Unfortunately, the real loser in
this situation will ultimately be
Kuwait. Yes, the world is behind
it, and yes, the world wants the
original Kuwaiti government
reinstated. But will they have a
country to rule over once this
crisis ends?

Right now, the Iraqis have
reportedly mined the Kuwaiti oil
ﬁelds to such an extent that the
land above the oil ﬁelds will be
blown off the face of the earth.
Nobody will have to worry about
redrilling for the reserves; the
place is going to look like Prince
William Sound: a vast reserve of
oil. All the oil companies will
need is a siphon to drain these
reserves.

But that's not the only problem
facing Kuwait. There are also an
estimated 400,000 Iraqi troops
within Kuwait itself. There is also
a similar number of troops in
Saudi Arabia waiting for the go-
ahead to invade the country.

 

 

Jeff
Tatusko

Since the Kuwaiti army was
virtually destroyed during the
original attack on Aug. 2, there’s
no need to worry about any more
people in the country.

Unfortunately, that almost
doubles the actual civilian
population of Kuwait, which was
estimated at approximately 1.7
million people. Many people,
during wartime, complain about
civilian casualties inflicted by the
armed forces (e.g., in Vietnam).
With the sheer number of fighting
troops in the country, thecivilians
are going to be decimated.

Let’s put this into perspective:
Kuwait only covers 6,880 square
miles of land. That's about the
size of New Jersey. Picture about
800,000 heavily armed troops
fighting within the confines of
New Jersey. There wouldn’t be
much left of that, either, with the
exception of a large crater.

One of the things that does
keep troops going in wartime,
however, is support from home.
They need this support to keep
their morale high. If they don’t

\I/

/|\

get this, morale will drop and

fighting capacity will suffer, —

resulting in far more casualties
than would normally be the case.
, Unfortunately, there are many
people in this country who don’t
want the treeps there at all. If this
country should go to war, some
people predict that there would
be a protest in this country that
would make the Vietnam protests
look like a day in the park.

For these soldiers, the war
scenario is fairly likely. But
without open support from home,
it’s going to seem like an awfully
long time period for them.

Whether or not the people of
this country support the
administration's handling of this
matter is a personal decision. If
you don’t support the
administration, fine. March,
protest, write letters, do whatever
your heart desires because that is
a right that all Americans have.
Just make sure that that protest
doesn’t lead to diminishing
support for the troops themselves.

I don’t want to see these soldiers
treated like those who returned
from Vietnam —-—- ignored as the
heroes they were because they
“fought a war that shouldn't have
been fought.”

Like most of us, I do know
some Americans currently in
Saudi Arabia, and I would like to
see them come home safely. But
I also know that theyare trained
to do a job. And if this country
can’t see ﬁt to support them, then

it decreases the soldiers’ ability

to carry out their duties.

Inside game falters as Pitt loses for first time

By Derek Willis
Staff Writer

Bryant Stith came back from a
first—half injury to scorch Pitt for
28 points last night, leading
Virginia to an 84-80 victory in the
opening game of the ACC—Big
East Challenge at the Richmond
Coliseum in Virginia.

Stith and guard John Crotty (18
points) provided a potent one-
two punch to hand the Panthers
their ﬁrst loss ofthe season in five
games.

Jason Matthews led the way for
Pitt with 24 points, but Sean Miller
was the only other Panther in
double ﬁgures, and nine ofhis 11
points came in the first half.

Pitt was also outrebounded SS-
28, although the Cavaliers played
a smaller lineup for most of the
game.

Leading 73-72 with 5 minutes,
30 seconds remaining, the Cavs
missed two straight shots but got
offensive rebounds both times,
enabling them to wear down the
shot clock. Stith then took over,
nailing a three—pointer to put
Virginia up, 76—72.

The Panthers missed several
offensive opportunities and were
forced to foul, allowing Virginia
in increase its lead to 82-74.

Jason Matthews’ three—pointer
with 26 seconds left brought Pitt
to within five, but his basket was
one of only three in the ﬁnal four
minutes by Pitt.

Virginia then ran out the clock

J for the victory.

In the first half, the teams went
back and forth as the lead changed
hands often. With 8:31 remaining
and Virginia up 22-18, Stith went
down with a twisted knee, and
was out for the half.

Wrestling team finishes 16th at Las Vegas Tournament

With Stith gone, Evans switched
to a two—three zone defense,
which proved more effective as
the Panthers tied the game four
minutes later and went ahead on
three straight free throws by
Matthews.

The Panthers outscored the
Cavs 26—18 after Stith’s injury,
building a 44-40 halftime lead.
Darelle Porter picked up his third
foul early on, and the bench
came to the rescue as Omo Moses
led five Pitt reserves with seven
first—half points — the first seven
of his career.

Gandhijordan replaced Porter
and scored three points and
provided solid defense, while
Chris McNeal and Antoine Jones
also contributed off the bench.

Pitt did not rely on its press in
the first half as Virginia broke it
easily and instead pulled back to
a half—court defense.

The Cavs outrebounded Pitt
and collapsed on inside players
Shorter and Martin, who
combined for 10 points before
intermission.

Both teams appeared to be
feeling each other out, as the
tempo was sluggish.

Without Stith, junior Anthony
Oliver picked up the scoring slack.
Oliver, who came into the game
averaging six points a game,
scored 10 in the opening period,
hitting five of six from the floor.

Stith came back with a
vengeance in the second half,
hitting six straight baskets, most
coming on the inside. He scored
20 of his 28 after halftime.

The tempo quickened, and after
Shorter picked up his fourth foul,
Stith and Kenny Turner provided
the spark for a 11-0 run, putting
the Cavs back on top for good.

Las Vegas is the home of Andre Agassi,
ﬂashing lights, show girls and slot
machines. But it was also the site of the
1990 Las Vegas Wrestling Tournament
held on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, when the Pitt
grapplers came home with some shining
stars of their own.

The Panthers ﬁnished 16th out of the 44
teams in the tournament and had a couple
of wrestlers place very well in their weight
divisions.

Scott Hovan at 158 pounds and Sean

Gibbs at 167 finished third and eighth,
respectively.

“Overall, these two guys carried the flag
for us,” said head coach Rande Stottlemyer.
“Both guys wrestled in very tough weight
classes and went against some of the best
wrestlers in the country.

“Sean is wrestling as good as ever in the
four years he’s been at Pitt,” said
Stottlemyer. “He beat two—time All-
American Scott Chenoweth of Nebraska.”

Two other wrestlers Stottlemyer
mentioned as having exceptional days
were Perry Miller and Joey Bursick.

“Joey is just a plugger,” said Stottlemyer,

“a hardworking kid.”

“The only thing wrong with Perry is that
he doesn’t get enough playing time,” said
Stottlemyer. “lBut] he’s starting to believe
he belongs. If he stays focused in doing
what he has to do, he’ll be up there.”

The winner of the tournament was
Oklahoma State. Other top ﬁnishers include
Iowa State in second place, Arizona State
in third, and Nebraska, pulling out a
fourth-place ﬁnish.

“It was a whale of a tournament,” said
Stottlemyer. “The only teams that weren’t
there were Penn State and Iowa. But we
see Penn State later in the year,”

Overall, the Panthers did much better
this year in the tournament, where they
ﬁnished about 10 places better than last
year. Stottlemyerwas happywith his team’s
performance, although he did see room
for improvement. I

“We would have liked to ﬁnish better
than this, but we went up against some of
the best kids in the country. This
tournament will beneﬁt us this year better,”
said Stottlemyer.

PI'I'I‘ BITS: The Panthers do not have
another match until Jan. 8, when they
wrestle Arizona State at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

Senior baseball is bacle, ibe Clippers are wit/ming...wbaz‘ next?

Hmmm...

0 Everyone knew he would be
a good NBA player, but did
anyone actually think that ex-

Panther Charles Smith would be

capable of scoring 52 points in a
game? Sure, it was against the
Denver Nuggets, but still, 52
points is 52 points. Smith and his
Clipper teammates are playing
like a playoff team right now,
even without Ron Harper. Smith
should make the Al1—Star team
this year.

0 Even Jerome Lane is playing
decently. He still makes less than
half of his free throws, but Rome
is starting now and is regularly
the team’s leading rebounder as
well as scoring in double figures
for the Nuggets.

0 Stat of the week: the Panther
basketball team, which already
has more wins than the football
team had this year.

0 Why did Ty Detmer win the
Heisman Trophy? No offense to
him, but doesn’t it seem like

 

Scott
Campbell

there is a quarterback like him
every year in college football? In
contrast, someone like Notre
Dame’s Raghib Ismail comes
around every 20 to 25 years or so,
because I don’t remember seeing
anyone else that explosive in my
lifetime.

- After almost losing to both
Siena and St. Francis, there is no
question how much a healthy
Brian Shorter means to Pitt. But
the two near—losses, combined
with the loss to Virginia last night,

also lead to anoth« ear1y—season
question. Are the I .llh€I‘S, at No.
11,overranked?

o I heard Sunday night that the
Dallas Cowboys (a 6-7 team) are
now ofﬁcially in the playoff hunt.
Already I hate the NFL adding
another wild-card playoff spot.

0 Here’s some good news. The
Senior Professional Baseball
Association is back. No, really. I
saw part of a game Saturday. The
Daytona Wheezers beat the Ft.
Myers Wash-Ups, 10-S. I think.

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Tuesday,December 4, 1990

L— 

Bubby, Mario, Buccos: no one escapes oz jersey

OK, OK,
enough.

Enough about Bubby, enough
about Mario, and enough about
the Pirates. This stuff about
Pittsburgh being the greatest
sports town has got to stop.

I’ve endured the Pirates
winning the National league East,
and despite occasionally waking
up screaming in the middle ofthe
night, have learned to learned to
live with it.

But where has that gotten them?
Even with Cy Young Award-
winner Doug Drabek at the helm,
the Bucs were unable to beat the
Cincinnati Reds, who had no one
on their staff nearly as effective.

The Bucs have made little effort
to keep September star pitcher
Zane Smith or scrappy second
baseman Wally Backman, and
these losses could be extremely
detrimental to the team’s future.
So enough about the Bucs; they’re
going nowhere fast.

I’ve also sat here for the last
two years and watched how all of
the Pittsburgh fans have drooled
over the potentially potent
Steelers, and I’ve also had to live
with that.

Let’s get something straight
here. Bubby — whatever kind of
name that is — is no future
quarterback. You thought Mark
Malone was bad; at least he didn’t
have a candy bar named after
him.

Sure, the Steelers have played
fair this season and have managed
to stay relatively near the top, but
they are by no means a team to
go bragging about.

Remember this year’s preseason
when everyone talked about the
Steelers, led by Brister and Joe
\X/alton’s high-tech offense,
making it to the Super Bowl? GET
REAL, GUYS!!! This team will be
lucky to make the playoffs.

Incidentally, Bubby looked
great against the Bengals this

I’ve heard quite

Christopher
Block

past weekend, didn’t he?

And what about Mario? God’s
gift to Pittsburgh. It seems almost
once a week, I turn on the tube
and have to see different reporters
outside the Penguins’ locker room
grilling the team physician or
general manager Craig Patrick
about Mario.

They always ask, Is he skating?
When will he practice? I think it
should be more like, Is he
walking? When will he be able to
tie his shoelaces again?

At the beginning of the year,
the Pens fans were going crazy
over john Cullen and Kevin
Stevens stepping in to make up
for the missing Lemieux, but
where has that gotten them?
Nowhere.

The Pens are currently sitting
in fifth place and remain 15 points
behind the first—place Rangers
and seven points behind the third-
place Devils.

Now, I understand your
obvious state of misery, and I
happen to have a few ideas to
rectify the situation.

First, go out and buy a nice
blue Mets hat. They’re not too
expensive and look a whole lot
better than the usual black and
gold. Next, while you’re at the
store, pick up a New York Giants
scarfand a Devils or Rangers key
chain.

Finally, stop watching these
local sportscasters blubber on
about how great Pittsburgh sports

are, and pick up a copy of the

New Yorle Post or watch
superstation WWOR on cable
sometime to get the New York
news. Following these simple
steps will allow you a few extra
hours of fun during the playoffs.
