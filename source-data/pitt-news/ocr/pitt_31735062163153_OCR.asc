Herter Praises Exchange Program

Secretary “of State Christian
Hertei" praised the University at
the Commencement exercises last
week for its active interest and
participation in international ex-

change. i -

Herter commended the Univer-
sity for establishing the Office of
Cultural and Educational Ex-
change for making the many great
advances in affiliation with for-
eign universities; and for offering
the many new and varied pro-
grams of study in international
affairs. ‘

He added, “In fact, Pittsburgh
has shown an increasing aware-
ness of our nation’s responsibility
to assist other peoples and to
learn from other cultures, and has
made this the basis of its pro-
grams found in very few Ameri-
can universities.

Exchange Vital

Emphasizing that a cultural ex-
change program is of vital im-
portance in ‘our whole’ foreign ‘pol-
icy, he stated, “We must always
remember V t_h;at_ what ‘touches

     

thinking is, perhaps, the most de-
_termining factor of all in shaping
historic events and the course of
civilization.” " . “
~ “Aware as we must continue
to be of the Communist threat,”
he concluded, “we must never
be so preoccupied with this.
challenge as to forget our own
constructive purposes.”

Flor tlrei Suite of learning

Thhe number of student-faculty discussion groups has
increased in the past few years, but such groups do not yet
reach the large majority of students.

Since there is a smaller student body this term, such
a program on a wide scale would present fewer organiza-

' tional problems. Many faculty members who live in the
Pittsburgh area and are not teaching this trimester, would

very likely be willing to participate in such an undertak-
ing. But few students or professors are willing to take the

"-1 initiative in planning these events‘.

The importance of such discussions cannot be overem—
phasized. An exchange of ideas outside the classroom be-

‘tween teacher and student can provide an opportunity for

increased understanding of a topic that can be skirted only
brieflypin class.

I Many classes are too large to provide any real inter-
play between students and faculty members, and still cover

‘ the course material, particularly under trimesters.

One of the opportunities which should be granted a
University student is to beneﬁt from the stimulating in-

-tellectual influence of distinguished faculty members.

Such programs as the Student Union’s “Quotes and

_ Comments” are a step in the right direction, as are the re-

cently organized tea hours discussions sponsored jointly by
Phi Eta Sigma and the Student Union.

These programs are admirable, but initheir mass par-
ticipation do not promote the intimate exchange of ideas
possible only in a small informal groupatmosphere.

Both faculty members and students should take the re-

sponsibility for forming such discussion groups~in the near

future, so that students can proﬁt fully from their Univer-
sity experience. ' -

Corrosion of Society . . .

A Human, Question

Dr. ‘Hugh Clelcnd

Dr. Cleland is an Assistant Professor of History.
Presently, he is faculty adviser to _the University
chapter of the NAACP and the Inquiry Club. He
specializes -in labor history.

The Pitt News has asked me‘ to contribute an
article on the question of segregatipn and Why I
think students should be concerned with this
problem.

In one sense, this article could be written in one
sentence: I believe students (and
everyone else) should oppose
segregation because it is morally

much of an article.

Anyway, there are other
Very obviously, it is unfortunate
for American foreign policy in a
world where most people are
darker than Caucasians. Very
obviously, segregation at home is
a poor advertisement for Amer-
ican /democracy. These factors are so plain that
nothing more need be said about them.

One of the reasons why segregation is morally
wrong is because it cripples those who are segre-
gated. As the Supreme Court pointed out in, the
decision outlawing school ‘segregation, the very act
of shutting off a child from the rest of society
inescapably instills in him the idea that there is
something wrong with him, and this psychological
scar can warp an individual for life. Any policy
which -cripples individuals also cripples the nation.

It Boomerangs , , . .

Another, reason why segregation is morally
wrong is because it cripples those who segregate —
that is, the majority. Segregation is an act of
hatred, and hatred corrodes the hater. _ Discrimina-
tion against a minority — any minority —- is an
act of unloading one’s shortcomings onto a scape-
goat. It is better to face one’s shortcomings and
correct them. .

White people should not combat discrimination
because they feel sorry for the Negro; they should
combat it in the interests of themselves.

One of the places where segregation and dis-
crimination are now under attack is the South.

Here segregation is not only a wrong in itself, but’

is also the keystone of a whole arch of wrong.
Most of the Southern Democrats who perpetu-
ate segregation and are perpetuated in ofﬁce by it
are also wrong on many other questions." They
block the development of a healthy two-party sys-
tem in the South; they oppose decent minimum

wage laws; they are against aid to education, aid ,

to health, aid to conservation.

They help to perpetuate unfair tax laws, par-
ticularly those which give special advantage to
Texas gas and oil interests. A whole system of
political, social and economic reactions has been
built around the keystone of .“white supre1nacy” —-
a white supremacy, by the way, which leaves most
southern whites little better off than the Negro.
Therefore, if segregation can be eliminated, the
Dixiecrat bar to general social progress can be
removed.

Our Own‘ Back Yard ‘ ‘
Many students, I ﬁnd, are opposed to segrega- .
tion in the South but defend it in Pittsburgh! The '
truth of the matter is that there is only a little
less discrimination in the North than there is in’
the South. Our public schools are almost as segre-
gated as those in the South because our neighbor-
hoods are segregated. In defense of «segregation in
the North, students still sometimes point to a ,.
higher crime rate, or inferior health cnditions, or. ‘H 
something similar as. justification for residential ‘or
job discrimination. , _ ' .3‘
C .What this amounts to is confusing effect with
If any group is crowded into ‘decaying
slums, sent to crumbling schools with inferior-
teachers, denied recreation,»d_enied equal job op-. 
portunities, ‘and insulted -daily in a hundred little
ways, than some ‘members of that’ group will be- V
have in an anti-social -way. Is it logical or fair, "
then to use this as a pretext for continuing the
vicious circle? Is it wise? _ I
Our own campus has some discrimination on it.
Some of the Greek letter organizatins have -dis-’
criminatory clauses in their constitution, and not 
just against Negroes. Some of these 'o1‘ganizatiyons:‘§f:.E-*4 3"
have- space in the dormitories, even. ‘ - I” I
Just lastweek, the University of Pennsylvania
ordered Sigma Chi to remove restrictive clauses
from its constitution. I would not want to see the I
University take steps against a campus organiza-
tion, but my own opinion is that the student gov- : :
ernment should. Does anyone agree? 

Open the Door . -

Removing restrictive clauses from Greek letter,
constitutions would not mean that these --groups‘
would be forced to admit anyone they Adidnot want’
to admit. It would simply mean that a student
organization would not be barred fromadmitting:
someone they might otherwise want to admit 'be-;‘*
cause of a clause put in the constitution years ago
and kept there by “old grads” or simply by inertia._ i

There is another reason why students should
oppose segregation, and it doesn’t have anything to . .
do with segregation. I think that students should 
have social consciousness in the United States just 
as they do in most other areas. In Koreaand Tur-‘_'~;
key recently, students have taken the lead in the
quest for democracy. A few years ago, Hungarian,
students were in’ the forefront of the attemptibyjy

Two Month Visit Offers Chance

, For Study

of U.S.

By TRUDY WEISS '

Medical School

-Two British medical students are currently observing
surgical and medical procedures- at the Universityas part‘ of
a student exchange program between the University School
of Medicine and St, Mary’s_ Hospital Medical School in Eng-

Goodwin of Sussex County cameé T

here April 26 for a two month stay
to familiarize themselves with our
medical school procedures.

Sutton Hamilton of Punxsutaw-
ney and Earl Smith of Pittsburgh
will leave today for the same
length of time to attend St. Mary’s
summer school program.

Exchange Started

The exchange ‘plan was orig-

.inated by Dr. Bernard Fisher, Pro-

fessor of Surgical Medicine at the
University, and Dr. Charles Robb,
Chief of Surgery at St. Mary’s.
After September, Dr.. Robb
will be Head of Surgery and
Brofessor of Surgery at the
University of Rochester School
of Medicine, Rochester, New
York.- . V
The original intention Qf the
program was to create better re-
lationship and better understand-
ing between'American and British
medical students. \
It was designed not only as an

academic experience, according to

Dr. Fisher, but as a social and in-
tellectual experience as well.

Fellowship Supported
The program is supported by the

. Cordelia Scaife May Post-Gradu-

ate Fellowship Fund, and it is ad-
ministered by the Vice Chancellor
of the .”Health Professions. .
St. Mary’s Hospital Medical
School is one of 12 medical
schools under the University of
London. It was here that peni-
cillin was discovered.

In‘ comparing the British medi-
cal program with -ours, Goodwin
and Bankes see many similarities.
“We use many of the same text-
books, and the clinical studies are
similar,” they said. '

Six Year Program

However, in England it is possi-
ble to enter medical school di-
rectly after secondary s c h o 0 l.

’ Their medical program consists of

three years of schooling in medi-
cine and three years of clinical

work in a hospital, as compared to
our four year program.
“Thus, the work of American
medical students is more con-
centrated,” Mr. Bankes said. He
feels that our program is harder
for this reason. ‘ .
Goodwin completed one year of
anatomical research, which has
qualiﬁed him for a Bachelor of
Science. degree. This is outside of
his medical school courses.
According to Dr. Richard J.
Cross, associate dean of medicine,
students are selected for this pro-
gram according to their high
scholastic ability, their character
and personality, and their interest
and desire to participate in this
plan.
