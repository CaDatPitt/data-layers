BAS vows to win

fight for student
x representation

-if

By Jennifer Calabrese

News Editor

The current fight that the Black
Action Society is wagin g for more
representation on the
presidential—search committee is
part of a larger struggle for greater
student involvement in university
decisions, according to BAS
political—action committee
chairperson Justin Laing.

That is why Laing said that the
BAS will not stop fighting for
representation.

“This is the beginning of a very
long process of getting the
students involved in general, and
to stop would be to think that this
kind of thing was not going to
happen again. This situation
warrants a fight on the principle
that the students have been left
out for a very long time, and if
you are going to reverse a trend
like that, you have to go to
methods that would be very useful
in the very long term. Students
will begin to be politicized,
mobilized and learn a lot from

that kind of struggle, as well as .

the short—term situation with the

searchlcommittee,” Laing said.

Laing said that the fact that the
search committee has already
begun working to ﬁnd a president
is not discouraging to the BAS.

“The fact thatit is moving on
very quickly means that we will
have to intensify things very
quickly. So we really hope that
the university understands this.
There are other ways of protesting
and I think that if the university
doesn’t take us seriously, that is
when we are talking about
something much more drastic
because a lot of people are upset
about this, and I personally do
not pay $11,000 to get treated
like this,” Laing said.

Today the BAS will hold a
march and rally to protest the
lack of student representation on
the presidential—search
committee. The march will begin
at 3 p.m. in front of the yellow
sculpture in Forbes Quadrangle.

“The reason that we are
marching is because we feel the
one student that was picked, Lisa
Campoli, cannot represent the
very diverse and different students

Pitt to develop teacher
certiﬁcation program

The University of Pittsburgh’s School of Education has been
awarded a $1.5 million contract to develop the nation’s first
national board certification for outstanding teachers.

“What we are doing here is a first, and it will effect others who
come after us,” said Anthony Petrosky, who is the primary
investigator for the project.

The certificate will be developed through extensive research,
including observing teachers, and will hopefully be a catalyst

for improving the educational standards in the United States, '

Petrosky said.
Working in conjunction with the Connecticut State Department

of Education, one of the chief aims of the 30-month project is '

to improve teaching standards across the United States.

The development of a voluntary teaching certificate will
focus on English/language-arts teachers of early adolescents.

People in Pittsburgh involved with the project include several
teachers whose teaching skills will be assessed and investigated.

Petrosky explained that the research would be conducted in
three ways: testing knowledge of subject matter, testing teaching
strategies and observing the teaching style of an individual.

“One other result that we hope will come of this project is that
it will push the testing field to re-look ways of testing,” Petrosky
said.

Petrosky expressed his concern for the present popularity of
‘multiple-choice tests.

“I was in a project assessment for reading and literature. We
broke from tradition by asking the students to write essays, and
we found that in each age group ——- 9, 13 and 17 — less than
5 percent could do the essays, while a significant amount could

\ do the multiple-choice tests," he said_

Local activists wor/e toward at more caring world for bomeless

By Eric Hoch
stag‘ Writer

In the book of Isaiah, chapter
58, God commands his people to
help the hungry, the homeless
and the oppressed people of the
world.

Today in Pittsburgh, people
like Jim Frazier of the Urban
League, social worker Dave
Stewart, volunteer Andrae Cassel
and activist Vince Eirene do just
that. All these people have
different styles to help those they
see as their fellow humans.

Frazier serves the homeless in
what he considers to be more of
a cure to the problem than a
soothing of the symptoms.

“Though the Urban League has
many programs such as Operation
Bundle-Up [which gives people
clothes] and Operation Round-
Up [which brings people to
shelters] which are good and help
people, they are not the cure,”
Frazier said from behind his
paper-cluttered desk. 9

“Affordable housing is not, right
now, a commodity. At the Urban
League, myself and the people
under me lobby Washington to
provide more money for housing.
Lobbying is a long, slow process,”
he said.

In order to make lobbying more
effective, Frazier organizes events
through the Urban League to
educate the public about the
problems of the homeless and
attempts to involve the public in
lobbying the government.

“In the past I have organized
protest marches and sleep-outs
in front of the City—County
Building in downtown
Pittsburgh,” said Frazier.
“Recently, the Urban League had
organized a play titled Home Is
Where in the Stephen Foster
Memorial at the University of
Pittsburgh on Nov. 19. The play
was about several homeless
people from different situations
and was produced by The
Underground Railway Theater Ia

Urban League hope to educate
and persuade people through

methods such as these: to call
their congressman and ask him
to push for more money for more
affordable housing."

Social worker Dave Stewart,
who works at the East End
Cooperative Ministry Shelter, feels
thatuntil more affordable housing
is made available, it is up to the
public to take care of the people
who suffer due to their poverty.

Stewart believes that giving the
poor food and shelter does not
alone solve the problem.

“Mother Teresa once said that
America’s poor are the poorest of
the poor,” said Stewart. “What
she meant was that because in
America a man is judged by his
wallet, and because our country
is very materialistic, our poor are
humiliated. They have very low
self-esteem, and that is what we
also try to correct here at the
shelter. We respect them and
treat and talk to them as equals.
Once we get them to feel good
about themselves — about who
they are — we can help in
whatever capacity they need.”

Stewart gestures across the
room to a man who has just

‘walked into the shelter and who

is wearing a green winter jacket
with a hood, .

“That guy is mentally ill and
needs medicine to help his
sickness,” Stewart whispers. “We
helped him get access to the
medicine he needs. Over there is
a guy with a wife and two kids.
He lost his home and his job
because he was accused of a
burglary he did not commit. While
his family lived with relatives, we
helped him find the strength to
go on and not give up. Soon he
will be working with his brother
down in Atlanta, Ga., and have a
place where he and his family
can live together. But in both
cases, we had to show these
people that we really cared about
them and that they were important
to us.”

Once a month at the shelter,
located in the East Liberty
Presbyterian’ church, Andrae
Cassel volunteers during the
evening to prepare the night’s

  

 
   

      
     
 
   
     
 

 
 

    

dinner and serve it to the evening's
guests. As he heats up 10-inch
turkey legs and puts a pot of corn
on the stove, he gives his reasons
for why he volunteers at the
shelter.

“After I graduated from Pitt, I
joined a Baptist church in
Homestead. [It was] the best thing
I ever did,” Cassel said. “One day
my minister asked me if I wanted
to join him in helping at this
shelter. I wanted to do something
for people not as well off as me,
and this was my chance. It’s easy
work because I used to cook at a
hospital in Philadelphia, my
hometown.”

A man with a mustache and in

his early 20s walks into the kitchen
and asks if the rumor that pigs’
feet were being served was true.

‘Sorry, brother,” said Cassel,
“but we got turkey legs, mashed
potatoes, sniffing, corn and
cranberry dressing for tonight.‘

As the guest leaves the kitchen,
Cassel says he will miss this job
when he leaves for Kenya, where
he and seven other people will
be helping the poor people of
that African nation.

Just as the people at the East
End shelter take their Christian
beliefs seriously in helping the
poor through the church, activist
Vince Eirene takes his Christian
beliefs one step further, in a radio

3

interview transcribed into his
book, ‘The Spiritual Roots of
Peacemaking.’

Citing Romans, chapter 12,
Eirene believes that it is up to
each and every person living in
this world to practice hospitality.

“There should be no soup
kitchens, and there should not be
bread lines, and there shouldn't
be people who are sleeping on
steam grates and whose main
meal is a bologna sandwich out
of the back door of a church,”

Firene said. “When the New‘

Judgement Day, the criteria isn’t

Going out with 61 hang...

What a year. T

In 1990, the University of Pittsburgh has seen a dynasty
enter its final stages, with controversy waiting’ to fill its
void. Pitt President Wesley Posvar announced his retirement
in May, saying that he would stay until the end of the 1990-
91 year. But the search for his replacement has been very
controversial, with power struggles and cries of racism
resounding throughout the campus.

It saw one man fight against the system to keep his
business intact. Charles Bonasorte, a vendor on the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard, had his license
revoked by the city and received a lawsuit from the

_ university over the use of its logo.

It watched as a single key caused havoc in its absence.
The missing master key of Lothrop Hall in November
caused the university to loosen its pockets and pay for
new locks throughout the dorm.

It watched athletic director Ed Bozik come under fire for
allegations of ignorance and mismanagement of funds.
Bozik was criticized for not watching money closely
enough, as $100,000 from the Golden Panthers fund
turned up missing.

It also saw the quick demise of a football team, which
started the season ranked in the Top 20 but ended with
seven losses, including a 52-10 thrashing by Oklahoma
and a heartbreaking 31-22 defeat by top-ranked Notre
Dame.

On the international front, Germany finally came together
after 45 years of cold separation. Popular elections were
recently held in the reunified country, with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl winning the race.

The Soviet Union, once a great power feared by the
world, found itself reeling from food shortages and
internal strife. Mikhail Gorbachev, once the most
charismatic and popular leader in the world, saw his
power diminish and his country tear itself apart, bordering
on civil war. .

The world saw a man lead his forces into battle and put
it on the brink of war. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
his army invaded the tiny country of Kuwait. As world
condemnation and isolation mounted against him, the
United States upped the ante and sent troops to intimidate
Hussein.

Now the world could be facing the bloodiest war it has
ever seen. Neither side plans to back down, and a
deadline for Hussein's withdrawal from Kuwait is set for
Jan. 15, 1991. We must, unfortunately, take a wait-and—see
attitude, in hopes that a peaceful solution can be found.

Finally, The Pitt News would like to wish all students,
faculty, workers and administration members a joyous
holiday season.

Pitt: A freshman ’s new "home"

So it’s the beginning of
December, and pretty soon Pitt
will empty out, sending most of
its thousands of students back
home for the holidays. I say
“back home” because “home” to
me now (as unusual as it may

sound) is the Pitt campus. I’m used to having trays
when I eat, picking clean silverware out of the
dispensers and scrounging for the cleanest bowl
before I get some soup. Heading to a place where
meals are cooked (or at least ordered out), where
I don’t have to ﬂash an ID to get into my house,
take an elevator to my bedroom or dial 9~l for an
outside line, is like heading to a whole new world.

I always hated when the people who had already
graduated from my high school and went off to
college came back. They acted like they owned
the world, and though Irespected them for “getting
out,” I hated their attitude of “I'm better than the

rest of you.”

Sadly enough, I know that when I go home, I’ll
be the same way because things change when one

moves out of home.

When I went “back home” for Thanksgiving, I
spent most of my time with either my friends from

Pitt or my boyfriend.

Was it selﬁshness? Conceit? Head blown up with

air?

No. More simply, I grew up, as most everyone at

Pitt did after leaving for school.

Don't get me wrong. I’m not saying I didn’t
spend any time with my friends from high school.
I just felt that I had more in common with those

Theta Chi responds to charges

We, the brothers of Theta Chi
Fraternity, Alpha Beta chapter,
would like to address the false
accusations made in the
Wednesday, Dec. 5, 1990,
Perspective article in The Pitt
News. First, in the Dec. 5 article it
was stated that Theta Chi held a
“housecleaning party in which
pledges were told to clean the
fraternity house.” In reality, what
occurred was a cooperative task
between the brothers and pledges
of Theta Chi, in which the
brotherhood, working
cooperatively with the pledges,
did home improvement to the
chapter house. This event is
recommended and encouraged
by the Theta Chi national
fraternity.

Letters

Secondly, [we wish] to address
the second false claim that the
“lInter-Fraternity Council] acted
with great swiftness to the
incident.” First, the incident
occurred in the middle of October.
The IFC did not officially act on
the incident until Nov. 1, some
two to three weeks after the
incident occurred. All remaining
forms of hazing were eliminated
by the chapter from the pledge
program two weeks prior to the
IFC notification and reaction to
the incident. This simply means
that Theta Chi took the initiative
of eliminating the last forms of

hazing from the pledge program
on its own without any outside
guidance. This shows that the
IFC was slow to react to this
incident and the chapter had
already responded and moved to
see that such an incident would
not occur again.[...l

We the brothers of Theta Chi,

5.

4‘

Alpha Beta chapter, feel that we»?

have been unfairly singled out by
the IFC even though we have
[shown] a willingness to change
and in fact have made changes to
bring ourselves in line with
university policy as it pertains to
pledging. We will continue to
monitor our program to ensure

that no forms of hazing occur in.‘

the future.

g U.S. not world police force...

Lt?

Jason
Hillman

Once again, the United States is involved

in a conflict that could escalate into a war. ‘

It is the first major conﬁict since the
Vietnam War, which was the first war in
modern times to shake the United States’
conﬁdence in itself, a war in which a
significant number of civilians opposed
the fighting openly.

Virtually every conﬂict since then has
been called a potential “Vietnam.” The
comparison, a media favorite, never
worked, and it doesn’t work now. I mean,
history never repeats. But it does love to
imitate.

The past tells us that isolation from the
rest of the world wasn’t a good policy. The
United States was isolationist in the early
1900s. It was deﬁnitely a bad policy during
World Wars I and II, where belated
entrances by the United States almost
caused worldwide disaster. So after World
War II, our policy changed to one of
interventionism.

Looking from a historical perspective,

Vietnam and its repercussions seemed to
be a bad enough experience to swing
American foreign military policy back to
isolationism. And the end of the Cold War
seemed like it would increase the chance
for change. But it didn’t. Conflicts like
Grenada and Panama seem to have brought
back conﬁdence in interventionism. In
Timemagazine, a poll said that 36 percent
of American citizens think Bush is moving
too quickly toward war with Iraq and only
31 percent don’t think the liberation of
Kuwait is worth fighting for.

But interventionism is not a good policy
either. For the United States to act as a
world police force by itself is arrogant and
dangerous. It undermines the value of a

United Nations.

Isn’t Vietnam now considered an
“American” war? Fact; Vietnam was a U.N.
“police action” that eventually became a
U.S.—sponsored “police action.” Fact: The
actions in Kuwait are considered to be
U.N.—sponsored even though the U.S. has
by far the most troops in the area, at least
75 percent. The fact that the United States
is considered the world’s police force
once again, even after a conflict like
Vietnam, is scary.

The Middle East is a powderkeg waiting
to explode. The United States has the
support of most of the countries in the
region — for now. But if the United States
invades, that support may disappear,
especially if Iraq launches a missile attack
against Israel. Some sort of nuclear
involvement is possible. There is a good
chance that removing Iraqi forces from
Kuwait City will be difficult if the Iraqi
military stations anti-aircraft guns and
missile launchers in hospitals and schools
and uses the civilian population as a
shield. I ﬁnd it hard to believe that the
United States military could pull the kind
of surgical strike it did in Panama.

The United States does not need to and

shouldn’t be the world’s police force. A

U.S.-dominated military presence is asking
for trouble, especially since the U.S. is not
exactly beloved in the Middle East. An
attack on Kuwait would at the least leave
Kuwait devastated and in the worst case
create a chaotic war covering possibly the
entire Middle East region and involving
both chemical and nuclear weapons.
It would be best if we could play less of
a role in this crisis, but it appears that this
possibility is fading. Bush has left only two
options for resolution of this crisis, of
which all the responsibility is on the
United States: Hussein caves in and
withdraws, which seems unlikely, or we
invade and pay the consequences.

...but radicals not the answer

For three years I have watched with
amusement and sometimes utter disgust
the rantings of those long—lost souls who
refuse to emerge from the confusion of the
19605, but now I believe the time has
come to startle a few members of the Pitt
community with a little reality. In the past

two weeks Pitt students have witnessed ~

the antics of people like “professional
activist” Vince Eirene, numerous peace
coalitions and even the Communist Party.
They whined about the urgency for college
students to renew the “me—first” attitude of
their mothers and fathers, as they held
hands and sang songs through one of the
most disastrous times in U.S. history. Let’s
look at what we allcould be facing if the
advice of people like Eirene is followed.
It seems that the aging hippies have
found a trampoline with which they can
attempt to vault the students of today into
the same insanity and lack of guts that was
so much a part of life on campuses across
the nation 25 years ago. Last Monday
Eirene spoke before several Pitt students
and nearly begged them to become

V involved in a modern anti—war movement.

He basically claimed that the United States
was currently plunging itself into a situation
similar to Vietnam, and that it was up to
the college students of the ’80s and ’90s to
push the government toward a policy of
ignoring the rest of the world so that the
entire domestic left—wing agenda could
ﬂourish.

There are many problems with the logic
of people like Eirene, especially in that
they are using the same old tired arguments
that most people realized weren't based
on fact decades ago. For example, we
always hear that war is an immoral act that
must never be used by any government.
The trouble is that people like Eirene only
demand that the United States refuse to
wage war.

First of all, the United States is justified
in defending the Middle East. If we allow
Saddam Hussein to escape the

Tom
Lester

consequences of his actions this time,
who will be his next victim? Israel? We
cannot turn our backs on countries whose
only crime is that they don’t want to be
blackmailed and controlled by a man who
would murder his own people by the tens
of thousands. One needs only to look to
Southeast Asia after the U.S. pullout in
1975, when all hell broke loose. Vietnamese
and Cambodian Communists ran
roughshod over the entire region. Where
were all of the moralists like Eirene when
the Khmer Rouge, with the blessing of Ho
Chi Minh’s successors, murdered hundreds
of thousands of Cambodians?
Furthermore, every dime of America’s
resources cannot be spent on the social-
engineering agenda of the far left There
are many problems that demand
government attention, particularly the
defense of innocent people against naked
a ggression. Let’s keep in mind that nobody
is calling for cuts in the cherished welfare
state. Welfare programs in particular
‘enjoyed almost complete amnesty in the
budget-cutting process of the last several
months, while the Department of Defense
took it on the chin.

Here’s my message to all of you
impressionable young college students:
Ignore the rantings of the lunatic fringe.
We have too many lost souls here at Pitt
who are desperately clinging to the ‘60’s
like the Holy Grail. Don’t let them sway
you. Never let the relics of radicalism
convince you that it is right to abandon
your principles simply because some idiot
with love beads implores you to do so.

Anniversary of Montreal mass murders remembered

I didn’t want to think about
anything when I picked up the
newspaper outside the David
Lawrence Hall computing lab a
year ago. It was the last day of the
semester; I had a 15-page paper
that was due in the morning.
Mentally, I was struggling to
remain focused on my work,
while emotionally I felt as if my
nerves had been stretched out on
a rack. I didn’t want to deal with
anything.

So when I read that 14 women
were murdered and 12 others
were wounded at the University
of Montreal by a man naiised
Marc Lepine, my reaction was
purely physical; my stomach felt
as if it had turned to ice. According
to The New Yorle Times, he went
to a classroom where students
were preparing to take a final
exam. Lepine ordered the men
and women to stand on opposite
sides of the room, then sent the
men outside. He shouted, “You're
all a bunch of feminists!" to which
a student replied, “No we’re not. ”
Her appeal didn’t work; all six of
the students left in the classroom
were slain. Eight other women
were slaughtered that day by

Levin, and he wounded 12 other
students. He killed himself later
that day.

The implications of this didn’t
occurred to me immediately, I
wouldn’t allow it; I had to ﬁnish
my paper. Dazed, I went back to
my writing thinking that I would
attempt to make sense of the
tragedy later.

A year later, I still haven’t ﬁgured
it out. I keep asking why, and I
look around me for an
explanation. During break, I
followed the news, watching the
media sensationalize the story.
Cameras intruded on the students’
vigil, and the reporters didn’t
seem very interested in
inieiviewing women. One man
who was hit in the leg by one of
Lepine’s bullets said, “He was
clearly gunning for the women.”

"Another male student, Francis

Bordeleau, agreed that the man
was hunting for women.
Bordeleau said that he heard
Lepine say, “I want the women.”
Despite this, few women were
interviewed for their reactions. In
fact, nearly all the media used
men almost exclusively for the
“human interest” quotes.

 

Lisa
Oshop

If some westerner had gone on
a rampage targeting African
Americans, Jews or Arabs,
reporters would have crowded
the offices of these group’s
leaders. (I'm afraid to imagine
what would happen if a man-
hating woman slaughtered 14
men.)

Had ethnic groups been
targeted, there would have been
riots; the whole world would
have risen in unison. Writers
would have written impassioned,
yet thoughtful editorials with
various psychosocial
explanations for the shootings.
But in this case, women’s voices

were not heard. Few opinions
from women were solicited. Why
is it that when women cry out,
the only sound we hear is a
whisper?

7beNew Yorle Times grudgingly
carried a quote from one feminist.
Jocelyn Cottier, coordinator of
the Concordia University
Women’s Center, said, “If you
combine an armed sociopath with
misogyny, this is what can
happen.” This was after a suicide
note was found on Lepine’s body,
the contents of which were not
disclosed to the press. But the
note conﬁrmed that Lepine felt
that women were to blame for his
life being a failure. According to
Jacques Duchesneau, chief of the
Montreal's police department
organized crime division, in the
note “[Lepinel mentions feminists
in particular.”

After a couple days of television
crews zooming in on the faces of
women crying, the media
abandoned the story in search of
happier stories more suitable for
the holiday season. Nobody had
given me an explanation.

If Lepine were alive, we could
question (and prosecute) him.

'His motives would be made
public, and throughout the whole
media freak show, some
questions would have been
raised. Why did he hate women?
Why did he kill them? And most
important, How could this have
been prevented?

But he’s dead, and itisup tous
to ﬁnd these answers. The first
step to ﬁnding out is to not forget
what happened to these women.
We must SHOUT, hold vigils,
march and declare Dec. 6 a day
of remembrance and reflection
of the violence that women face
every day.

Homeless

Continued from page 3
but if we visited the prisoners, if
we housed the homeless, if we
gave clothes to the naked, if we
gave drink to the thirsty. We have
the responsibility to take the
homeless into our houses. That’s
not an option in the New
Testament; that’s something that
has to be done.”

Eirene lives in the North Side at
his own homeless shelter, Duncan
and Porter House. This shelter is
like any other house that someone
would own and live in.

It has hardwood floors with
rugs in the middle. The walls are
white with pink trim. It has a
living room with a television and
stereo. The dining room contains
a hutch and a large dining table.

Two walls have paintings hanging
on them, which were done by
Eirene’s artist friends. The kitchen,
which is in the back of the first
floor, has a stove, a refrigerator
and pots and pans hanging from
hooks on the ceilings and walls.

The upstairs boasts a newly
redone bathroom, which is
spotless, and several bedrooms.

Duncan and Porter can
accommodate five to seven
guests, and those guests,

according to Eirene, will not be
alienated by dehumanizing soup
kitchens and shelters.

“With those who are homeless,
it depends on us changing our
hearts and changing our lives
and also putting forth a world
view that looks at society through

The women’s team pulled down five top spots...

First-place ﬁnishes prove to be the norm for track

By Sharon Kerestes

Ronise Crumpler was a double
winner, and Kimberly Blair,
Cathleen Chrissos and Allison
Williams each captured first places
for the Lady Panther indoor track
team at the West Virginia I loliday
Invitational Saturday.

Crumpler, considered one of
the top sprinters in the country,
won the 55-meter in 7.03 seconds
and the 200 in 24.74. ller time in
the 200 makes her a provisional
qualifier for the .\‘CAA national
meet.

Williams led Pitt’s domination
of the 55 hurdles. She won in
8. 1 1, followed by Clarissa Dudley,
Arrhpr and Blair. In
addition, Blair ran 57.17 to win
the /100, and Chrissos won the
mile in five minutes ﬂat. Williams
also placed fourth in the 200.

Alzfvib

Pitt’s 4x400 relay team;
composed of Williams, Monica
Hockaday, Archer and Blair,

placed second.

“We use this meet to start off
and see where we’re at in our
training,” said head coach Steve
Lewis. “We can see if we’re on
the right track or going in the
right direction.”

The Holiday Invitational is one
meet that’s always on Pitt’s
schedule, and Lewis says it gives
him an excellent chance to
compare his team’s performance
from year to year. 1

His evaluation?

“We have exceptional talent,”
he said. “The whole team has
definitely improved from last
year”

Lewis has some definite ideas
about where he’d like to see his
team go this season.

“We have a mile relay team that
can qualify at nationals and score,”
he said. “We also have a few

Swim coac/9 lauds Picklo as

best Captain in nine years

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s swimming coach David
Belowich thinks Theresa Picklo is the ideal team
captain because of her immense talent. Even
though Picklo is extremely successful in the
pool, the talent he refers to has nothing to do
with swimming.

“She is an incredible leader,” said Belowich.
“Sometimes great athletes can’t deal with people
too well — not because of conceit but because
they have different goals than most people.
Theresa has the ability, though, to handle the
people around her, while still setting her goals
high.” ,

Picklo feels that she is able to do this through
example.

“Whether I’m in the pool or out, I try to set an
example. I also try to keep things fun while I do
it. I think more people pay attention that way,”
Picklo said. A

Pitt junior Laura-Lee Sullivan is certainly
impressed with l’icklo’s leadership.

“Theresa is an inspiration to the team. She
keeps plugging and working when she doesn't
have to,” said Sullivan. “I look up to her as a
swimmer and a person.”

“The thing that makes Theresa so special,”
said Belowich, “is that she is just as accom-
modating to the greenest freshmen as she is to
the most experienced senior. She is probably
the best captain I’ve ever had.” Surely high
praise from Pitt’s nine—year head coach.

Things weren’t always this good for Picklo,
however.

When Picklo graduated from Plum High
School, Belowich said she was a good swimmer,
but she really never came into her own until her
junior year.

“Theresa had one of the most phenomenal
breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” said Belowich.

Picklo managed to record a time of4 minutes,
51 seconds in the 500—yard freestyle at the
Eastern Women’s Swimming League
Championship, 21 time which was five seconds
better than her previous best of 4:56.60. With
this time, Picklo qualified for the Senior Nationals,
a prestigious summertime meet where she
competed against Olympic gold medalist Janet
Evans, and the 1992 Olympic trials.

“The progress she has made at Pitt is simply
remarkable,” said Belowich. “Often times, talent

goes unfulfilled, but not in Theresa’s case. I

honestly wish she wasn’t a senior so she could
stick around for a few more years.”

 

the national championships.“

Last year, the mile relay team
of Keisha Demas, Hockaday,
Dudley and Crumpler qualified
for both the indoor and outdoor
NCAA nationals. That team also
gained All-American honors and
won the indoor and outdoor Big
East Championships.

This Saturday the Lady Panthers
travel to George Mason University
in Fairfax, Va., where they will

against other Big East teams.

Scuba club prepares
for deeper waters .

By Spencer Borisoff
Sla_[/‘ lVr1'ler

The University of Pittsburgh
Scuba Club will be plunging into
the sunny waters this spring break
when the club travels to the the
Florida Keys to scuba dive.

The club, which has been active
for three years now, is headed by
Peter Treloar, president; Paul
Frustaci, vice president and Chris
Chizek, business manager.

According to Treloar, the club
keeps active between trips by
diving at local dive spots, such as
Strawberry Quarry, located near
Slippery Rock University, and
Willow Springs, near Harrisburg.
The team members also meet
every month to discuss future
dives.

The only prerequisites needed
to dive, according to Chizek, is
scuba certification, which can be
acquired by taking a two—credit
scuba course here at the uni-
versity, and enough money to
cover the cost of this relatively

I

expensive sport.

“Some fish only come out at
night, and sometimes you can
see fish sleeping,” Treolar said.

The club is able to explore the

' waters to a much greater extent

than the average person gets to in
a lifetime. According to Treloar, it
is not unusual for scuba divers to
stay under water for an hour at a
time.

“A lot of changes happen to a
diver’s body when they’re
underwater,” Chizek said. “The
deeper you go, the harder it is to
stay under because of the
pressure,” she continued.

Chizek said that the safety limit
is 100 feet for the divers, but
usually the most colorful things
can be found within the first 50
feet. Often the club will explore
tankers and other vehicles that
lay dormant under the surface.

Treloar said that many good
dives will be made during spring
break in Florida.

“A good dive is when you set a

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 6, 1990

 

 Man tono man...
One of Pitt’s hoop defenses leaves much to be desired

tr-
i

_ .«.‘*\

Just a few notes on the 4-]
Panthers 

There are few teams in college
basketball which can play man-
to—man defense well, and
unfortunately Pitt is not one of
them. _

This point was evidenced in
the last two games. In both,
Darelle Porter, the team’s best
defensive player, picked up three
fouls in the first half and spent a
lot of time riding the pine. This is
not exactly the first premise of
Pitt’s defense. True, against St.
Francis, Pitt did come back and
win, but the Virginia game
exposed the weaknesses inherent
in the Panther defense. While
Mike Iuzzolino tired down the

stretch under the burden of
carrying the offense, Bryant Stith
stepped up and performed at a
higher level to lead the Cavaliers
to victory. Great players do this.
Pitt will face a lot of great players
this year.

Matchups are the key problem
for Pitt. Case in point: Stith’s big
three-pointer late in the contest,
which basically broke the
Panthers’ backs. The man
assigned to Stith, Bobby Martin,
was fighting through a pick as
Stith put his shot up. Martin did
all he could to get to him, but the
point is that the 6—foot-5 Stith
should have been covered by
someone else. At6—9, Martin can’t
slide through picks without

dive plan, follow it and stay within
the safety limits,” he said.

The spring—break is not only
limited to certified scuba divers.
People with no scuba experience
are welcome to come along, help
out on the boat and enjoy the
sunshine. For those who aren’t
certified but wish to become so

before the trip, special arrange-
ments can possibly be made.

“Scuba diving is one of the
most fun things to do with your
clothes off,” Treloar said. “It’s
something everyone should
experience. You have to consider
yourself a visitor though, and
treat the environment with
respect.” P

attracting a lot of attention. .If he
forces his way through, chances
are good that he gets nailed with
a foul. Darelle would have been
the ideal player to cover Stith, but
when foul trouble strikes, a
defense can break down.

The man—to—man is a much
better defense than the zone, but
it also requires more disciplined
players to make it work. Teams
like Indiana and Duke don’t often
get beaten for a bevy of inside
baskets like Pitt did Monday night.

The two-three zone was more
effective, possibly because it is a
more familiar defense. But a good
solid man-to-man defense is what
nearly every basketball coach
aspires to play. It definitely suits
Paul Evans’ style of play and can
be an effective weapon for this
team in tbefuturc.

By bringing in new players
who are athletic and able to play
two positions, ‘Evans is
unquestionably on the right track
to producing a team which can
play the man—to—man. But the
fans must be patient, as this
process takes time.

One of the current problems
was also evident during Monday’s
game. Virginia point guard john

Crotty, not exactly revered for his
blazing foot speed, had little
trouble getting past the Panther
guards. If there is one thing that
breaks down a defense, it is
penetration into the paint by a
guard. just think of the point
guards that Miller will face this
year: Michael Edwards of
Syracuse, Chris Walker of
Villanova and Darrick Martin of
UCLA, to name a few. These
players are all quicker than Crotty.
IfPitt wants to play the man-to-
man, it will probably take its
lumps for a while. But with the
veterans on the team, the
transition will be smoother. It
also will pay off down the road
— maybe even later this year.

Swimmers Woes range from transfer problems to mono

By Chris Kuzneski
Slu_[]‘ Writer

\\“'hen Lady Panther Julie Rocks was a
senior at Bethel Park High School, she
narrowed her list ofcolleges to two schools
— Pitt and the University of Maryland.

After much deliberation, she decided on
Maryland and anxiously looked forward
to swimming under her new coach, Rick
Curl.

Rocks’
l1owe\'er.

“Two days before I got to school,” said
Rocks, “the coach that recruited me [Curl]
left Maryland. 'l'hat was really difficult for
me to take.”

attitude quickly changed,

beginning of Rocks’ trouble, though.

“I originally wanted to get into pharmacy
as a freshman,” said Rocks. “W/hen I talked
to my adviser, I found out that that meant
I would stay on the main campus [College
Park] for two years, then I would complete
my education in Baltimore at a branch
campus lUniversity of Maryland at
Baltimore Countyl.”

That also meant competing for two
separate swim teams.

“I really didn’t like the idea of different
swim teams existing under one university,”
said Rocks. “It didn’t make sense competing
for both.”

Because of Curl’s resignation, Rocks
was legally allowed to transfer to Pitt after

“When Rick resigned, we [the freshmen
recruited by Curl] were guaranteed release
papers from Maryland at the end of the
year. Something got screwed up between
Pitt and Maryland, though,” said Rocks.

Rocks was ruled ineligible for her
sophomore year at Pitt as a result.

“A technicality cost Julie her eligibility
during her first semester at Pitt,” said Lady
Panther Coach David Belowich.

“lThe problem] was more at Pitt’s end,”
said Rocks. “Any other transfer from
Division I could compete at any other
school, but not Pitt.”

Belowich and Rocks decided to fight
the rule, and they eventually won.

“We had our first appeal denied,” said

and they gave me my eligibility [for the
second semester] four days before a big
meet with Penn State.”

“I refer to it as the ‘Julie Rocks ru1e,”’ said
Belowich. A

Despite contributing to the squad last
year, Rocks felt that she would really make
her mark this year.

Unfortunately, Rocks was hit with
another setback.

Rocks was stricken with mononucleosis
this summer, and suddenly all of her plans
had to be put on hold again.

“It’s very frustrating,” said Rocks. “It’s
one ofthose things that ifyou try to do too
much, you get sick again. I’ve tried to
come back quick, but it doesn’t work. It

Coaching problems were only the her freshman year. Rocks. “But We re—appealed to the board,

Ellis’s time in the 55 hurdles
made him a provisional qualifier
for NCAA nationals. Provisional
times were set because in past
years there has been a low
number of NCAA qualifiers in
certain events. The provisional
qualifying times are somewhat
slower but ensure that a fair
number of runners compete at
NCAAS. Meeting the provisional
qualifying time, however, does
not guarantee NCAA part-

captured the Big East indoor
championship in the 55 hurdles
and placed sixth in that event at
indoor nationals. He also placed
fourth at NCAAs in the outdoor
110 hurdles last season.

Overall, Vasvary was pleased
with the results and stressed the
importance of this meet in
preparing for the season ahead.

“Whether [the guys] do good or
bad, this meet keeps them going.
If they do good, then they say,
‘I’m going to keep working.’ And
ifthey do bad, they say, ‘I’d better
get working,” Vasvary said.

Because it’s a low-key meet,
Vasvary said it gives him the
opportunity to move people
around to different events.

“Maybe somebody can come
up and surprise you —— show you
something. It?s a good meet 89:
that,” he said.

It’s also the perfect opportunity
to give freshmen their first taste
of collegiate competition.

Vasvary said he really couldn’t
compare his team’s performance
against those of other teams. For
this meet, many coaches operate
on the same strategy as Vasvary
does, with runners switching
events and trying new things to
see what works best. Still, the
experience ofcompeting against
other teams is always helpful.

Managing Editor

Their looles are deceiving -
well, downright disgusting, to be
perfectly honest —- for the
members of GWAR are not of this
Earth. As a group of intergalactic

0: Yes!

H: How are you?

0: Oh, dandy! Just picking at
my putreﬁed anus, feeding the
delightful tidbits to my many
slaves. They covet such anal
intrusions. .

H: You’re speaking to me

warriors, it was banished to the from the Slave Pit?

Earth. After spending thousands
of years frozen in ice, GWAR was

ﬁnally freed and taleen under the
greedy watch of SleazyP. Martini.
The rest is rock ‘n’ roll history.

I had the humanly pleasure of
speaking with G WAR’s
"mouthpiece, ” Oderus Urungus
from the Slave Pit, and living to
write my story. (Most journalists
areleilled during theirinterviews.)
Oderus, along with his cohorts
Balsac, The jaws of Death
(guitar); Beefcahe the Mighty ~
(bass), Flattus Maximus (guitar)
and jizmale the Gusher (dmms)
have become the masters of “shock
rock.”

The following is a transcript of
the delightful conversation I had
with Oderus. Spending a
thousand years in ice can make

you awfully grumpy.

Oderus Urungus: What do
you want?
' Human: Oderus?

O: No. Well, yes. Well, no.
Well, yes. Well, a bit. No, actually,
yes, I am here at the Slave Pit
right now. I've decided to “pop”
in, as it were, unannounced to
the various slaves who are
working now, like dogs,
ceaselessly for my muddied goals.

H: What exactly is the Slave
Pit?

O: The Slave Pit — there are
many Slave Pits secretly across
the world — is a place where we
get the human slaves of GWAR
— the various creatures that we
use to serve us —— to scrape the
dried fecal matter off our
mammoth, ornate armored suits.
They work, slave, in seclusion far
beneath the bowels of the cities
of your continents and produce
things for GWAR. Occasionally
we will pop in and destroy a few
of them —— put a couple in the
lard bubble bath. And then, of
course, reward some with little
stinking hunks of genital cheese.

Playwright Laboratory showcases student talent

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

The great thing about laboratory
theatre productions is that you
always get more than you
bargained for. Typically
minimalist in design, they can be
wonderful expositions of a
playwright’s raw intensity —— his
or her instinctive and personal
vision. The customary process of
trying out original scripts on stage
usually generates little
expectation among theatregoers,
butvery often the experience can
be just as good, if not better than,
full—scale productions.

Such is the case with Pitt’s
Playwright Laboratory Showcase,
which opened yesterday for a
three—day run at the StudioTheatre
in the Cathedral of Learning.
Directed by Theatre Arts Professor
Kathleen George, this 40-minute
anthology of six short
monologues and exploratory
scenes offers an exciting and
imaginative look at cu rrent works
by Pitt playwriting students.

In the first monologue,
Sleepover, written by Erin Lee
Flynn, we are introduced to the
restless Paul (Tom McClure) a
wandering soul-searcher who
hasn’t been home in years. After
spending the night at a girl’s
house, Paul relates to his friend
Dan (Andy Miscuk) the enormous
generosity which this seemingly
malicious girl favored him with.

heartfelt gesture, one that does
not betray genuine goodwill. “It
was really cool,” says Paul. “We
didn’t fuck; we just slept. She
didn’t shut the door, and her
parents were in the next room.
And at breakfast, her mom kept
filling my glass with orange juice,
and I kept thanking her. It was
really cool!”

Tom McClure’s easy-going and
sincere disposition is naturally
convincing and, at times,
humorous. He shows a
remarkable confidence in the
blocking space. In addition, the
actual presence of a silent but
reacting Dan makes the entire
monologue more meaningful.
Occasionally, Flynn’s dialogue
seems over-loaded with “Gosh-
gee” lines like “really cool” and
“fucking awesome,” but it all
eventually adds to the. comic
quality of Paul and his
neverending praise.

Therapy byjudy Woodside is a
bit less successful in its projected
message and at times it suggests
its own notions with an
overbearing blatancy. Penny
(Erin Flynn) believes there is
nothing wrong with her (of
cou rse) and claims that her recent
plunge into solitude is a natural
phase in young life. The entire
monologue details examples of
the tempestuous relationship she
has with her parents and Penny’s
ultimate, half-baked self-analysis.

Meyung Kim, who also plays Old
Woman and Woman, middle-
aged in later scenes here) delivers
a reiteration of the first line with
punchline vigor and predictable
vitality. Erin Flynn, while being
a very talented writer, has less to
offer here as the tormented Penny,
but she ends up being adequately
stubborn during her therapy.
Small Victoriesis a funny, if not
clever, work that engages us in a
brief examination of the ever-
elusive meaning of life. A Jill
Flerning’s monologue about a
woman named Vicky (Lynn
Bernatowicz) who ties up city
traffic by standing on a ledge, is
allat once serious and comical.
Her husband Ralph, silently
played (again) by Andy Miscuk,
looks utterly ridiculous, trying to
talk his wife out of her ostensible
suicide; he never gets a word in
edgewise during her tirade.
Conversely, Vicky eventually
reasons that her life is now
important because she has, for a
brief moment, pissed off every
New York commuter in the traffic
jam she’s started — all by simply
standing on a ledge and saying
nothing. While Vicky stands
there, philosophizing about how
one person can affect the lives of
others, we start wondering why
Lynn Bernatowicz’s accent
fluctuates between Brooklyn and
New England.
Tom McClure’s Parle Bench is
easily the best of the lot. A witty,

ParkBencb not only pokes fun at
the volatility of male/female
relationships but also the very
language used to incite passion
and romance. And how ridiculous
it is! McClure’s dialogue is filled
with self-mocking pet names (“My
little strawberry sundae, my little
doe, my little sweet pudding”)
and a barrage of outrageous
metaphors that are as
purposefully written as they are
obvious (“My sugar woman," “My
man of beef jerky, I’ll lick the
drips of your ice cream cone;”).

that’s what makes it so
entertaining. McClure knows how
ridiculous it sounds, and so he
fulfills our ' unexpected
expectations. McClure not only
makes fun of his words, but of
himself for writing these words.
Who else would have a woman

most vital of all life’s luxuries.
All I got was lawn seats  for
Mond}ay night.

But, I didn’t care. I had
TICKETS!
Through a series of

unfortunate mishaps, I arrived
late for the concert. I missed his
first four numbers. Ironically,
three of them were among my
top 5 favorites. It was as ifI was
destined to live in
disappointment. I was quite the
angry young man.

But, harki He returns!

Billy Joel is coming to the
Pittsburgh Civic Arena on Dec.
12.

This time I did it right. I waited
out 17 and a halfhours and got
myself 12th row  center
stage (Ha! Ha? Hal). Why should
I worry? I could walk to the
arena, if worse comes to worst.

A lot of my friends have been
jerking me around because I am
one of those guys who never
got over Billy Joel. While they
were bobbing around to the
new—wave sound, I was still
engrossed in Songs In '177eAm'c
(1981). And when Billy got
married and stopped producing
those rip-your—heart--out—and-
throw—it—on—the-floor—and-
stamp—on—it ballads, a lot ofmy
friends gave up on him.

But, in all honesty, wouldn’t
YOU be happy ifyou could go
home [0 Cl-lRlS'l'lli l3RlN'Kl.lZY
every night? Give him a break!
Billy has given the world an
awful lot of happiness through
his music. I think he deserves
his own little paradise now and
then.

I do concede that Billy hadn’t
been producing the same quality
of music throughout most ofthe
’80s. His lyrics have gotten less
specific and therefore less
poignant. He has given in to
less complex rhythms and
shorter piano solos. The array
ofinstruments used in his songs
has been reduced to the basics,
and he has not recorded an
instrumental in 16 years.

But I really have to give him
that leeway. Billy spent most of
the ’80s on tour. Isle also
provided the voice of Dodger
the dog (as well as singing
another song) for the Walt
Disney Pictures animated movie
Oliver and Company. In short,
Billy has been busy.

And So It Goes....T he confessions of 21 Billy Joel fan

Nevertheless, Billy Joel has
released an amazing 14 albums in
his 19-year solo career. That makes
him one of the most prolific
songwriters and musicians in
history. (Yes, he does write all of
his own music and lyrics.) I
challenge any person on this planet
to produce as many quality songs
as he has produced. Take all the
time you need.

The first single from Storm Front
(1989) was “We Didn’t Start The
Fire. ”It earned Billy his first No. 1
hit since “its Still Rock and Roll To
Me” (1980). Billy has had less than
20 No. 1 hits, but this data is
deceptive. “Tell Her About It”
(1985) went platnum, but it never
topped the charts. In fact, five
singles from the same album, An
Innocent Man, fared respectably
on the charts (and that came out a
year afterBillysupposedlystopped
producing good material).

In reality, all Billy changed was
his style. Billy went pop for a
while. So sue him. It was GOOD
POP-

Let’s face it. Society is fickle.
Billy was just adapting.

My friends called this “selling
out.” I called it getting his second
wind. Whichever is the case, Billy,
somewhere alongthe line, decided
that he had got to begin again.

With the release of Storm Front,
Billy rewarded all of us who have
been keeping the faith. In his first
album of new songs since the
I986 failure, The Bridge (Well, I
liked it), Billy has returned to his
old tried—and—true formula. In an
interview televised by Video Hits
One, Billy said that Storm Front
consists of rockabilly and blues,
the kind of music Billy originally
played as a teenager. It’s the kind
of music he likes.

He also predicted that it would
be a‘ gas to play on stage.

“This stuffsounds greatlive!” he
declared.

Although I missed some of the
concert, I agree. I’m glad he took
this turn around.

I picked up the album the first
day it was released and literally
jumped for joy.

The title track is so smooth! You
almost have to wear shades before
you can listen to this one. Billy
must have spent some extra time
backstage with Ray Charles after
they recorded “Baby Grand” for
7799 Bridge.

Dr. Space and Sleaz give new meaning to ‘College Rock’

By Jim Tezak

News Editor

Reclining in an office chair in
Crawford Hall, James Pipas
doesn’t seem much different from
any other professor at Pitt. He
seems quite at ease in his sport
coat, slacks and shoes.

Pipas has a bachelor’s degree
in chemistry and a doctorate in
molecular biophysics. He has
been teaching and doing research
in Pitt’s department ofbiological
sciences for 10 years. He has
lectured around the world.

Dress Pipas in blue jeans and a
T—shirt, however, and an amazing
transformation takes place. Every
other Thursday at Peter’s Pub in
Oakland, Dr. James Pipas
becomes Dr. Space, one half (or
one third, depending on how
you look at it) of the musical
group Dr. Space and the Sleaz.

“Welcome to lifestyles of the
drunk and perverted,” says Pipas’
brother Mark, alias the Sleaz, one
night as the group winds up its
first set. It isn’t clear whether he’s
talking about the crowd, the band
or both.

“A lot of college professors are
into music. Mine is just a little
different,” said Dr. Space.

The Sleaz plays electric guitar,
and Dr. Space sings lead vocals.
The two are backed up by
Robodude, a computerized
keyboard. The group plays mostly
covers of classic rock songs, but
the Sleaz occasionally throws in a
composition of his own.

“Hey, does anybody pick their
nose out there?” the Sleaz asks
the crowd. He doesn’t wait for an
answer.

“Everybody picks their nose,”
he says. He then breaks into a
Sleaz original, “Pick, Roll and
Throw.”

“Sleaz is the best guitarist-
songwriter in Pittsburgh, probably
the world,” Dr. Space said.

Where does he rank himselfon
the musical-genius scale?

“I’m below Roger Daltrey.
That’s accurate,” he said.

“I may be one of the better
kazoo players, maybe. My
strength is the D kazoo; I’m a
little weak on the F kazoo.”

According to Dr. Space, the
band can play a wide variety of
music.

“Mark and l, in other formats,
play almost everything you can
imagine. It’s just that in Peter’s
Pub people don’t want to hear
opera or show tunes.”

Actually, Dr. Space and the
Sleaz do demonstrate a range of
their musical talents to the patrons
of Peter’s. During one set they
played the theme from “Petticoat

Junction,” “Bungalow Bill,” “The
Asshole Song” and a medley of
“Happy Birthday to You” and
“Birthday” by the Beatles for
someone named Lisa.

Last week, the Sleaz even
played a short riff from M.C.
Hammer’s “Pray” on an acoustic
guitar. Instead of the correct
words, however, he sang, “We’ve
got to spray.”

The group’s musical diversity
doesn’t please all of the bar’s

3 customers, however.

“He's an idiot. They sing Elvis
Costello and the Grateful Dead in

vw. ..a . 4.- run ‘rm

. .;v....t-.,..-.~...m..-xu..»n....- ta. . . .‘.v-v...—.»......»-.-“.1-

the same set. They should be
taken out and executed before
sunrise,” said Will Young. Some
fans have said that Dr. Space
resembles a slim Jerry Garcia.

While the Sleaz is a professional
musician, Dr. Space was born by
accident. About seven or" eight
years ago, Pipas said he was at a
bar in Oakland called the
Portfolio, which had an open
stage. A man came up and
introduced himself as Mr. Krud
and asked Pipas what his name
was.

When he was younger, Pipas’
friends had called him Dr. Space
because he liked theoretical
physics. That was the first name
that came to Pipas’ mind, and Dr.
Space and Mr. Krud was born.

“We found that we both had
something in common: We both
liked Wild Turkey whiskey. So
we had a few shots and decided
to play together,” Dr. Space said.

Mr. Krud has since moved on
to bigger and better things, but
Dr. Space wasn’t nearly ready to
retire yet. Dr. Space and the Sleaz

began playing together in 1983
when Pipas was giving a talk at
the Imperial Cancer Research.
The Sleaz tells a different story,
however.

“We started in the bedroom
when we were kids. It really
started with the now—historic
group The Jinx when we were
kids,” the Sleaz said.

Although, Dr. Space said he
likes to keep the academic and
musical sides of his life separate,
Dr. Space and the Sleaz completed
a worldwide tour called “Around
the World for Science and Music”
about a year ago.

The tour covered 21 countries,
including stops in China, the
Soviet Union and Eastern Eu rope.
Dr. Space would give a science
lecture, and then Dr. Space and
the Sleaz would perform.

“One of the common themes
of the trip was that science and
music are universal,” Dr. Space
said.

Dr. Space said that the group
was in Vilnius, Lithuania, during
a time when 100,000 people were

protesting. While there, they
played with one of Lithuania’s
top rock bands.

“In English, they’re called The
Duck, but in Lithuanian it’s a
name that sounded like a rock
band,” Dr. Space said.

According to Dr. Space, playing
in Pittsburgh isn’t much different
from playing in Moscow, with
one exception.

“It’s pretty much the same
everywhere, except people
around here can understand when
you sing the wrong words," he
said.

Dr. Space and the Sleaz have
also played at the 100th
anniversary celebration at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, where
the double helix was discovered,
and at the opening ceremonies
for the new molecular biology
building at Princeton University.

Back in Oakland at Peter’s Pub,
Dr. Space is demonstrating exactly
what he means about singing
lyrics. The Sleaz began playing
John Fogarty’s “Old Man Down
the Road,” but when Dr. Space

ran out of lyrics, they switched to
“Suzie Q,” barely missing a beat.
And at the end of the song, they
had a special treat for all of their
female fans present. ‘

“If you are the first girl to
request a song, you get a very
special prize. You get to spend
the first break ...” Dr. Space begins,
“... in the van~with the band,”
they ﬁnish in unison.

One of the things bar patrons
like about Dr. Space and the
Sleaz is that it is about the closest
thing you can get to an audience
participation band. People yell
out names of songs they want to
hear, and Dr. Space and the Sleaz
make their best attempt at playing
them.

“Eminence Front,” one person ‘

yelled. None of the regulars at
Peter’s could remember ever
hearing them play that song
before, but the Sleaz just started
playing like he had known it for
years.

“They didn’t really know it, but
they just started playing. It was

Okay, get ready for this.

A French diplomat has a 20-
year affair with an apparently
beautiful Chinese opera star with

‘ whom he falls hopelessly in love.

After those 20 years, he finds out
he has really been in love with a
man.

But maybe he knew all along
and consciously denied it.

Such is the case in David Henry
Hwang’s Tony Award—winning
play M. Butterﬂy, which made a
special run at the Benedum Center
from Nov. 27 through Dec. 2.

Gallimard the diplomat, played
by Philip Anglim, lives out the
stereotypical Western male’s
fantasy of being loved and adored

by a subservient Eastern woman
(Song Liling), a role ﬂawlessly
performed by Alec Mapa.
However, as Gallimard believes
that he is in the position of power,
he is carefully manipulated by
Song Liling into divulging French
secrets, as the striking woman
uses every tactic in the book to
keep her man confused, happy
and always guessing.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 6, 1990

Gallimard’s actions are
reinforced by M. Toulon (Kevin
Cooney), Gallimard’s superior,
who winds up promoting him
and congratulating Gallimard on
keeping his liastern mistress.

Thus, Gallimard unknowingly
becomes a traitor, divulging
confidential information to his
beloved and winding up in jail.

The play is filled with
philosophically humorous, yet
sensible lines, as when Song l.iling
says in reference
effectiveness at manipulating Gal-
limard, “Only a man knows how
a woman is supposed to act.”

After the wondrous opera star
goes so far as to drop his drawers
center stage, Gallimard is finally
faced with the concrete reality.
But Gallimard goes to
unbelievable lengths to hold on
to his version of /l/Iaclamelmtterjly
and applies makeup, a headdress
and a graceful robe before finally
killing himself, in the end seeing
himself as the true “Butterfly.”

M. Butterﬂy raises the question
of how far we all 1 will go in
holding on to our ultimate fantasy
— how much we are willing to
deceive ourselves. Gallimard had

finally achieved success after an
adolescence and young adult life
ofsexual failure when he became
involved with Song Liling. For 20
years, Gallimard had homosexual
relations with a man in drag.

“How could he not know? He
must have slipped a hand down
there or something!” said one
character in the opening act.

But through the context of the
play, it is believable. When Song
Liling finally takes the makeup
offand turns into a man— a short
break ofabout five minutes while
the audience is able to witness
the whole process — he tells the
ruthless Comrade Chin of his
most challenging acting job in
making Gallimard believe he was
a woman the entire time.

All performances were flawless,
including Rachel Ann Jones’
portrayal of Renee, a blonde
bimbo visiting China, who just
thinks the whole experience is
simply “neat.” Gallimard has his
second extramarital affair with
the promiscuous Renee, and
Jones does an excellent job of
portraying a young woman who
revels in a one—nighter.

In addition, Brian Reddy’s
performance ofMarc, Gallimard’s
longtime friend who appears even
in dreams to give him advice on
the opposite sex, is a fine portrayal
of a popular guy who never
graduated to mature adultvalues.

The play is based on a true

story of a recent espionage trial .

in France.

Stephen King's ‘Misery’

By Scot Ross
Editor in Cbief

It’s no secret that Stephen King’s
novels have floundered in their
cinematic adaptations. With few
exceptions, graphic and bloody
effects replace the tension and
internal pain of the characters
King develops in his books.

Directors and screenwriters
adapting King thrillers such as
Pet Sematary and Christine
struggle under the task,
employing cheap comedy to
compensate for the lack of
character development.

Mz'5e7y, King’s latest work to
make the book—to-screen
transition, suffers from these
similar symptoms but is saved
from terminal campiness by
director Rob Reiner’s prescription
of suspense, surprise and a dose
of wit.

King’s novel is about pain. (All
right, it’s about misery.) It’s about
the miserable pain of romance
novelist Paul Sheldon’s broken
body as it lies helpless after a car
wreck and in the ca re of a devoted
reader and psychotic ex-nurse

named Annie Wilkes, who
introduces herself as Sheldon’s
“No. 1 fan” and tortures him
accordingly.

If the film were to be true to the
book, an intermingling of
Sheldon’s hallucinations,
emotional torment and narcotics
dependency would have been
the challenging route taken by
the filmmakers. Alas, it was not,
and Reiner and screenwriter
William Goldman chose to
concentrate on Annie’s
punishment and confinement of
Sheldon as the plot.

The movie begins at a turning
point in Sheldon’s career and life.
Sheldon, played by James Caan,
has completed his first book away
from the romance genre. His
bread-and—butter character,
Misery Chastain, was killed off in
his soon—to-be—released novel,
and his latest writing conquest is
a liberating account of real people
in real situations.

Driving down the snowy
mountains of Colorado, however,
Sheldon’s ride to freedom takes a
twisted turn. A car wreck later,
Sheldon awakens inside the

isolated’ home of Annie Wilkes.
(Kathy Bates). Wilkes pats herself
on the back as she explains to
him how she found him and how
well she has been treating his
mangled legs and separated
shoulder.

Wilkes seems nice enough, and
Bates skillfully plays her
somewhere between caring
mother and giddy schoolgirl. She
explains that the blizzard has
knocked down the phone lines
and closed the roads, but soon he
will be able to get to a hospital
and begin his recovery.

The relationship between the
two borders on touching,
especially when Annie asks
Sheldon if she can read the new
manuscript she dug out of the
wreck. He smiles, saying that
Only his publishers and people
who save his life are allowed to
see his unedited work.

Needless to say, the life of the

manuscript isn’t up to the

standards of Annie, Misery

Annie’s abrupt loss of temper

Mercurotorzes
Island Records

Toto, I have a feeling we’re not
in Kansas anymore 

The second release of
Southwest-based band, The Buck
Pets, takes a dramatic but delicious
turn with their new album,
Mercurotones.

The Buck Pets, the darlings of
college radio with their premiere
album 779eBLtC/ePet5, have proven
with their new album that you
don’t need to be redundant with
a successful formula to maintain
quality.

Where before they were a four-
piece band with hard, fast guitar
licks and haunting vocals, their
new album comes off as more
clean and polished, with the
addition of harmonicas, horns
and even strings.

Though the feel of the music is
at times vastly different from that
of the first album, Chris Savage
and Andy Thompson continue to
take turns with lead guitars and
vocals. Savage’s voice, which
sounded a little strained on the
first album, has matured greatly
and includes a greater range of
musical capability.

Ian Beach continues to be a
driving force with his heavy bass
soundings, and Tony Alba’s
drumming will get you moving
even on the laziest of mornings.

“Pearls” is the only song that
has a lot of the flavor of the first
album, with all of the members of
the band included in the vocals.
It is methodical and hard and

THE PI'I‘l‘ NEWS, Thursday, December 6, 1990

probably the best song on this
album.

“Brother” is a gripping tune
with a guitar feedback sound that
is faintly reminiscent of something
you might find on 21 Jesus and
Mary Chain album.

“Libertine” and “Hey Sunshine”
are two notable tunes that
embody _the band’s departure
from the original Buck Pets sound.
“Libertine” is a funky, foot-tapping
cut with harmonicas and horns
(produced by The Dust Brothers).
“Hey Sunshine” is a surprisingly
melodic song that might leave
you swaying gently, thinking
about the Texas landscape.

The Buck Pets aren't a heavy-
metal, ’60s retrospective, nor are
they a pop band. They are fresh
and clean, and Mercurotones is
one of the most creative and
diverse releases from Island
Records this year.

If you are fortunate enough to
catch the Jane’s Addiction tour
this winter, then you will be
doubly blessed — The Buck Pets
are the opening band.

Watch out, thou gh——The Buck
Pets are giving Jane’s Addiction a
run for their money on college
airplay charts — and rightly so.

Robert Johnson
The Complete Recordings
Columbia

RobertJohnson’s brief life lasted
from 1911 to 1938, and it was
during his last few years that he
recorded what has since become
some of the most influential music

 

of all time.

All 41 songs thatJohnson ever
recorded are now available on
the recently released boxed set,
Robert ]o/mson — T be Complete
Recordings.

Robert “King of the Delta Blues”
Johnson could play guitar like
nobody else. He sounds as if he
had been born doing it and the
guitar is merely a natural
extension of his anatomy. On
some ofthe songs, such as “32—2O
Blues,” it actually sounds as if
there are two guitars being played
simultaneously.

One likable aspect ofJohnson’s
performing is that he is not trying
to be llashy or to make an
impression on anyone. Instead,
his playing reflects what he is
feeling deep within himself.
Whether it be the joyous
exhilaration of “They’re Red Hot”
or the painful realizations of “Love
in Vain,” Johnson expresses his
emotions in a truly genuine
manner.

Listening to this music, one
immediately notices thatJohnson
has influenced many recording
artists who followed him. Cream,
Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers,
Bob Dylan and many others have
been touched by his work. Classic
albums by the Rolling Stones,
such as Aftermath, Beggar's
Banquet, Let It Bleed and Exile
OrzMaz'rt Street are all full ofwith
numerous techniques and styles
that Johnson created.

Included in this boxed set is a
48-page booklet that true fans of
Johnson will be thrilled to see. In

Continued from page 5-8
addition to the lyrics and
recording dates of the songs, the
booklet contains numerous
photographs and a rather
thorough history of johnson’s
life. From this, one learns many
interesting things aboutiohnson,
such as that he could repeat
somebody else’s song after
hearing it just once. Those who
don’t already know howjohnson
died may be surprised to learn
that he was (sort of) murdered.

Even if you own all of Robert
Johnson’s other albums, this one
is still worth purchasing because
it contains previously unreleased
alternate takes. Thus, we are
presented with two versions of
“Cross Road Blues,” “Love in

Vain,” and 10 other songs.

The best songs here, such as
“Terraplane Blues,” “32~2O Blues”
and “They’re Red Hot,” are
wonderful evidence of Robert
johnson’s skills as a composer,
guitarist and singer. Had he lived
longer, who knows what else he
might have accomplished?

The Jesus Lizard

By Brian Berger
Staff IVriler

Hail! Hail! The Jesus Lizard!
This four-piece outfit consists of
vocalist David Yow (ex-Scratch
Acid), bassist David Sims (ex-
Scratch Acid and Rapeman),
guitarist Duane Dennison (ex-
Cargo Cult) and drummer Max
McNeilly (ex—Phantom 509). But
don’t look at the horriﬁc picture
the Lizard paints; just listen and
imagine.

This is a journey through the
underbelly of life, a journey led
by the psychotic vocals and lyrics
of Yow. The man is a menace to
society; his obsession with human
decay, shit, blood and voyeurism
(all represented in his songs)
show the makings of a most
beautiful ﬁrst—<:lass psychopath.

And oh! How beautiful the
music is. Dennison’s relentless
groove guitar riffs stick like butter,
while Sims’ bass rips and shreds
you into submission. The drums’
short, tight rhythms march in order
to Yow’s vocals that choke their
way into your id.

The sound is raw, yet textured
undeniably the Lizard due to
Yow’s manic vocal shrills and
Dennison’s unforgettable finger

The supporting cast of Lauren
Bacall and Richard Farnsworth
are kept in the background, but

they handle their roles well. The .

gem of the film is Bates, whose
voice manipulation and
determined manner leaves the
audience holding the breath every
time she enters the room.

0: She was there. You were
just looking in the wrong place at
the wrong time. Undoubtedly you
were at the bar swilling away,
trying to pick up some girl who
_was desperately bored with your
company.

You probably came back, and
a whole thing ofvomit hit you in
the face, and you were busy
brushing that out ofyour eyes for
a while. She was there. Obviously
you’ve been a bad boy, and you
weren’t rewarded with a vision of
her tremendous beauty, but you
have only yourself to blame, for
this. .

H: Where does the hand get
inspirations for its songs?

0: We watch a lot of the
human culture, and we make
jokes about them and how
ridiculous they are. Occasionally
we write about the funny human
things that you do. Various
celebrities of the human race
give us pause to think, likeJacques
Cousteau or perhaps the immortal
Burl Ives.

More of our songs come from
the deeds and the great stories
that we earned for ourselves in
the millions of years that we
ravaged the universe before we
even came to your planet. There
might be a song about Beefcake’s
love for a Coke machine or the
first genital wart I ever had, or
maybe the obliteration of Hob
Quirm 7, a particular battle that I
remember with a great amount of
relish and a little bit ofketchup,
too.

H: Did you ever get your

penis‘ back from the police in
North Carolina? (Several
months ago at a show in North
Carolina, Oderus was arrested
on obscenity charges. The
police conﬁscated the phallic
symbol which Oderus claimed
was a ﬁsh.)

O: No, I don’t really care about
it because l’ve already grown a
new one which is twice as big
and even more deadly and can
spew at least a mile. So I will be
inseminating and impregnating
en masse again; more humans
will be bloating up than ever
before. 8

Tipper Gore is still using the
first Cuttlefish as her own personal
sex toy. Though the police have
agreed to give it back, we still
haven’t worked out a date when
it will actually be resewn on to
my body. Then I will have two
Cuttlefish.

These humans keep calling this
thing a penis, like it’s some kind
of human penis, like I was trying
to simulate a human sex act. This
is such an insult. Nothing could
be further from the truth. it is a
fish, a cuttlefish, a radioactive
creature from beyond Uranus.
Indeed, I find it most appalling
that a human would try to link
that in any way with an actual
human sex act. In fact, I think that
they’re the sick ones.

H: Well, I stand corrected,
then.

0: Oh, yes! indeed you do, as
usually humans are.

H: How do you feel about
people like Tipper Go re, Jesse
Helms —the entire ceusorsh ip
issue?

0: Somehow these lame
humans have elevated themselves
to positions above the other
humans, who are equally
ridiculous and tepid, and they’re
ordering people around.
Occasionally they can harness
forces I’m a lot more concerned
about some oftheir goon squads
—— more than anyone, Granbo
and the Morality Squad. They’re
so right wing they’re left; they’re
out there. Tipper Gore, Jesse
Helms —- they don’t mean a thing
to me. But Granbo, her nephew
Private Parts and their ferocious
bodyguard Tiny —— now there’s
something that I really worry
about. They’ve been following
us around gig to gig 

She was the creature that
actually managed to sever my
Cuttlefish from my body with her
whirling death machine. I’ve been
battling them across the country
now. She wasn’t satisfied with
just chopping off the entire
Cuttlefish; she wanted the bloody
nub as well. I couldn’t let her
have that, so we've been battling

l CMAGOI Donal I988

 

By Manny Theiner
srayf Writer

You don’t usually see the words “avant garde
and “blues” in the same sentence, but that’s
what’s unique about an unassuming figure named
Loren Mazzacane, better known as the Yenusian
Bluesmaster — Guitar Roberts, who will perform
on Sunday at Carnegie Mellon. While hundreds
of small-time acts, many of whom regularly stop
at the Corner of Rock and Roll, are currently
demeaning a longstanding American tradition
by unnecessarily attaching such hyphens  
rock” and “rhythm-n,”’ Mazzacane is taking the
blues a few steps further than anyone else.

The music on his record In Pittshargih (so
named because he based it on his impressions
of our city after a recording session at \VW’l-ii’) is
so other-worldly that you'd swear Jandek and
Sun Ra merged with Blind Willie Johnson into
one superhuman being. Mazzacane pulls
heartstrings with microtonal note—bending and
plaintive passages so ghostly quiet that you can
hear the ‘wind whistling through the creaky
floorboards of some dimly lit front porch.

The Guitar Roberts version of the blues is the
envelope—pushing kind that finds its way into
“new music” venues like New York’s Knitting
Factory and Montreal’s New Music America but

has little connection to the art/improv scene.
Rather, he has independently developed his
own original style, transcending the boundaries
of familiar blues forms and shooting out into
stark, unheard territory that some might call

_ blues noir, a soundtrack to an eerie bone—chiller

of a film. llis haunting style combines with the

understated vocals of wife Suzanne Langillev

(who also acts as manager) to almost
unrecognizably alter the cover songs he performs
—— from Chuck Berry to Lonnie Johnson — as
well as lending stately distinction to his original
compositions.

.\la'/.zacane has also released seven of his own
records on the St. Joan label, each one sporting
a stark white cover with a small glossy photo in
the center; the title is written with a silver pen.

Whether or not you believe in any deity, you
must believe while listening to the meditative
music ofGuitar Roberts that there really is some
mysterious creative force that could erupt in any
of us at any time. When Guitar Roberts howls at
midnight, you know he’s got the blues.

(}‘ii.z'tar Roberts plays Sunday at the Forbes
Gallery, located at Forbes Avenue and Margaret
Morrison Street on the Carnegie / ’ellon campus.
’/he show hegins at 8 p.m., and all ages are
welcome.

Continued from page S-3
brilliantly articulate McClure’s
seminal work. It is a campy and
wildly funny scene.

In Striptease, Stacey Ghetian
explores the world of cocaine,
booze, sex and sin — all to tragic
ends. The powerful story of one
woman’s entrapment by a sinister
strip-ioint owner is told with great
poignancy and alarming reality.
If only it weren’t so pointless.
.\lary’ellen Rowlett stretches her
sexy body from one end of the
stage to the other, telling the club
owner of her; child, sniffing
cocaine through a dollar bill and
allowing her boss to feel her up.
Her performance is certainly

believable, and she has the
drugged—out preoccupation of
someone who has sold her soul.
But there is never enough time
for her to develop. Rob
Masterson, fresh from his role in
The Tapeworm’s Last Hurrah,
delivers a striking performance
as the cruel and demanding club
owner. He is the quintessence of
low-life scum and villainy. While
this could turn out to be a modern-
day Tennessee Williams play -
what with all the decrepitude
and soul—searching going on — I
don’t think that Stacey Ghetian
has enough material here. It truly
seems like a piece of a larger
work, which it probably is, but

seeing it out of context only raises
unanswerable questions. What’s
the point of their final embrace?
What’s so new about these
characters? Haven’t we seen them
before? Who knows? It certainly
looks interesting, though.

In the final scene, Double
Entendre, Erin Lee Flynn depicts
the emotional collapse of Fe, a
girl whose history of sexual and
mental abuse haunts her through
various nightmarish images: two
men who know she wants “it”

and can make her feel good ~

(played with relish by Masterson
and Miscuk), an old woman
(Meyung Kim) who blames her
for her own sexuality and a

who tortures her with suggestions
of sinful pleasures. It’s a much
more intense and serious work

 Flynn’s Sleepover. But for

some reason, it too, seems
preoccupied with its own
imagery, although the entire scene
is largely carried by the marvelous
talents of Jennifer Chervenick,
who confronts each image with
unquestionable terror. It’s a very
emotional show with a lot of

watch poor Fe writhe in horror.
In that case, Flynn has succeeded
in projecting a remarkable scene

awesome,” Grant Geraci said.

Dr. Space concurred with
Geraci.

“I didn’t know the words. I just
made them up,” he said. “I love
that song. Sometimes I know the
words; tonight, I didn’t.”

“Pinball Wizard,” yelled Adam
Kamras a little later. There are
always plenty of Who fans around
when Dr. Space and the Sleaz
play.

“Never heard of it,” Dr. Space
said.

“Bullshit,” Kamras said.

“That I’ve heard of,” Dr. Space
said, and they played the song,
one of their most well-received
numbers.

Sometimes the people in the
bar get slightly carried away with
their requests, but Dr. Space and
the Sleaz are usually ready for
them.

“Kareem Abdul—Jabbar,” one
overzealous fan blurted out.

“L.A. Gear,” said the Sleaz.

Dr. Space and the Sleaz also
have several other features that
appeal to the bar crowd at Peter’s.
At the end ofa set when the band
is ready to take a break, Robodude
will play the theme from
“Jeopardy,” or Robodu de and the
Sleaz may team up to play the
theme from “Mister 

One night whenever the Sleaz
got thirsty, he would play songs
from different beer commercials
until the waitress appeared from
the bar with the desired beverage.

Dr. Space, however, usually
refuses to take any credit for the
band’s hijinks. ‘‘I’m only an artist
man. I have no control,” he said.

The crowd even likes the way
the band ends an evening of

' playing at Peter’s.

“Head ‘em up. Move ‘em out,”
Dr. Space will say, and then they
play “Rawhide.” That’s a standard
Dr. Space and the Sleaz ending,
but fans never know when it’s
going to be one of those nights
where Dr. Space breaks into a
kazoo solo at 1:55 a.m.

Much of the group’s appeal
comes from it being being able to

S relate to the audience and being

just a plain old rock ‘n’ roll band,
according to Dr. Space.

“We’re rock ‘n’ roll stars. We’re
making nowhere near thousands
of dollars,” Dr. Space said. “Most
rock ‘n’ roll bands, they have
roadies. But us, we’re a macho
Pittsburgh band. We carry our
own equipment; we do our own

._ setup.”

“I make the Maytag repairman
look like Hugh Hefner,” said the
Sleaz one night as he was packing
up Robodude.

“Tell him he has a loyal
following here in South Oakland,”
Pitt student Jeff Custer said.

Rico's Music Video Guide :

By Rico Gagliano
For T be Pitt News

Well, MTV hasn’t gotten any
better since the last column, so
here’s some more thoughts to
ponder while you’re blowing off
finals in front of the tube.

1. Poison, “Something to
Believe In’’ —— Oh, wow, dudes,
like, Poison is sooo deep. They
totally are sad about Vietnam

I and Jim Bakker —— plus, they

 

don’t wear lipstick and fright
wigs anymore!

Yeah, right. This video came
about this close to winning last
coIumn’s worst video award, but
I figured it’s sooo bad it’s actually
interesting, like Plan 9fr0m Outer
Space or the Third Reich. Watch
the camera spin around and
around the guitarist to hide how
short he is. Watch the bassist
pretend he can play piano. Watch
the lead singer get so choked up
with emotion he forgets to lip-
sync (pair this slab o’ celluloid
with Sinead O’Connor’s “Nothing

Compares 2 U” clip and get
yourself the definitive textbook
of How to Sell Emotion). Bet
your rent check Poison is crying
all the way to the bank.

2. Wilson Phillips, "Impulsive"
— My friend Ron put it best: “I
wonder how many people refer
to the fat one as ‘The Fat One?”

3. Pixies, “Dig for Fire” — I
know you're gonna think I’m
favoring videos by progressive
bands, but honestly, this is the
best video ofthe year. It’s actually
two videos. In the “Dig for Fire”
segment, we get a fairly typical
Rambo—esque montage of the
band members suiting up for a
show then being chauffeured to
the concert venue via motorcycles
complete with sidecars. It’d be
pretty unspectacular if it weren’t
for the fact that the Pixies’ tongues
are generally rooted pretty far
into their respective cheeks, a
fact that becomes apparent in the
second “Alison” segment. A title
somberly announces “The Pixies
performing live at such—and—so

stadium,” then the camera pulls
back. Indeed, the group is
performing in a stadium, but
there’s no one in the seats. It’s
just these four musicians
wandering around a football field.
I can’t think of a more apt (or
funny) way to lampoon those
self—important, pagan
idol—worship fests that comprise
the majority of performance
videos. Did you ever notice that
“priority” one of most videos is to
make gods of T op 40 commasters?

booting, watching SO VCRs at
once all playing Nazi war-atrocity
footage, playing croquet with
world leaders’ severed heads,
spreading butter on our genital
warts, playing golf with the rotting
carcass of Burl Ives  I am an
epicurean, a famous chef. I like
to hang around the torture
chamber and get my kicks. I’m
pretty much a quiet guy, a family
man.

H: What types of music do
you like to listen to? Do you
have any favorites?

0: I enjoy listening to the
bleating songs of whales; Umla
and the Bubbletones are my

     
     
   

favorite. Some bands that the
humans have created, such as
Carcass, Slayer and Napalm Death
of your world, are soothing to my
pointed ears, but they are of
course human, and as such they
offer absolutely no competition
to us whatsoever.

H: Do you have anything to
say in closing to the people of
Pittsburgh?

0: Let me say that it has been
some time since we have visited
your seething, writhing, filthy
metropolis. We hope that in the
meantime that you have been
eating lots of red meat and getting
all bloated and fat for the show.
