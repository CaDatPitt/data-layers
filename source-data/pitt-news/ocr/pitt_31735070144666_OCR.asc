in general studies, Dean was like most students
— quiet during class, shy to ask-questions and
impatient for the lecture to end. ‘
“As you get older, you learn _to appreciate
more,” said»Dean, who’s sporting a blue flannel
shirt and a mustache, his hand gestur-

ing while he speaks. “Now I don’t hesitate to ‘

say something, tight or wrong”

After graduating from McKeesport Senior 0 I

 School in 1979, he served ir1 the Navy
for ﬁve  He worked at in the sales de-
partments at lkea stores in both Virginia and
Pittsburgh and then transferred to a small copy

' and fax machine company, Van Dyk Business

Systems. ' _

Dean’s salary eventually reached the highest
it could, given that he had an associate’s degree
and not a bachelor’s. So three years ago, he de-
cided that it was.time to go back to school.

i “I wish I would have done this 20 years

ago,” said Dean. “[Getting a degree back then] ,

would be worth probably $20,000 to $30,000
more than it is now.” ‘

Dean got his general education require-
ments out of the way at the Community Col-
-lege. of Allegheny County while working full
time in the evenings He left Van Dyke Busi-
ness Systems in the fall to come to Pitt as a full-
time student 0 _

According to the National Center for Edu-
cation Statistics, there were 6 million adults
older than 25 enrolled in postsecondary insti-

tutions in  That’s about 43 percent of all

students. V . ' _
The center predicts that by 2012 there will
be 6.7 million adults older than 25 in college

—— which would be more than half of the col— ‘

lege population. The report also said that in
-2004, 98 million people older than 25 — 49

' percent of American adults -— participated in

some type of formal classes These statistics in-
cluded work-related courses and those offered
by postsecondary institutions. '

Dean said he hopes _that ifihe earns 
' bachelor’s degree, he can ﬁnally get over some
of his regrets. '

He regrets not  calculus in 
school, ‘and he said thatiit is-much more dif-
ficult now that he is _older. And then there’s the
fact that if he would have earned his bachelor’ 5
degree whenhe was in his 203, he could have
retired in five oi 10 years ' .

“My earning potential hit its limits, and if I

had to push my retirement past 70,” he said. H
Getting this degree will help him lower that

retirement age. , ’ “V

.. “With age comes _tremendous darity about
,what your goals are and about how important
that _passage of information really is,” she said.

Now she never misses a class, sits up front _

and always pays attention. She even enjoys the
challenges of her ‘more difficult classes. She
has_n’t taken a math class in more than 30 years,
and she tackled biostatistics last semester.

“The wonderful  about it is thatowhen V

Desiree Kosmisky, a pre—pharrnacy student,
is the undergraduate teaching assistant for this
business calculus class. At 20 years old, Kos-
misk_y is less than half the age of both Cassesse
and Dean. _ ‘ '

Kosmisky said it was interesting to have

we’re thinking that student leaders will be

.. more effective once we’re not all stressed

about tests. Hopefully we are going to raise
a lot when we get back from spring break,
when people aren’t being totally destroyed
by exams,” said Schutzbank.

Caryn Goldenberg, who is helping
Schutzbank with the group, echoed his op-

tirnism.

“We’re planning some things to get
to the student body, whether it’s sitting
in Towers Lobby or the student union or
talking to students on the Cathedral lawn
in between classes,” said Goldenberg. “We

want people to know we’re not giving up ,
C on this.” '

Goldenberg said she thinks bystanders
at the riots fueled the destruction, even if

they weren’t actively involved. She said that
donations are a way to repent for the lack
of intervention. '

“I actually yelled at some guy who was
turning over a car. It sounds stupid to be

like, ‘Put that car down,’ but just standing »

idly by is worse,” said Goldenberg.
Schutzbank said he’s not sure what spe-
ciﬁcally the money will go toward, because
the University’s insurance covered much
of thedamage. But he thinks the Univer-

sity will use it to replace at least one of the
campus trees uprooted in the revelry.

He said it matters less what gets re-
placed and more that students show they
care about the Oakland community.

“No matter what happens, if people

realize that college students aren’t all assh-

oles, that’s what we want,” said Schutzbank.
“It’s something of a symbolic donation.”

“But we’re definitely going to raise
more,” he said.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, in a state—

, ment released last month, called Schutz-

bank’s initiative “heartening.”

“The quality of Pitt students is mea-
sured by the strength of their character
as well as by their academic abilities, and
that character has been shining brightly in
recent days,” said Nordenberg in the state-
ment.

  Stimulus grant a good gesture

to make up for bad policy

In the beginning of Febru-
ary, Gov. Ed Rendell proposed
tuition relief aimed at helping
students attending Pennsylvania’s
state system universities and com‘-
munity colleges to alleviate their
ﬁnancial woes. It could give up to

A $7,600 per year to students whose
families earn less than $100,000 a
year, reducing pressure from tu-
ition and other expenses.

Left out from this plan,
though, were students at the
state-related universities — Pitt,
Penn State, Lincoln and Temple.
Those students were excluded
from tuition relief even as Ren-

V dell’s budget cut appropriations

G to their schools, all but guarantee-
ing a tuition hike.

Rendell attempted to ﬁx this
omission Tuesday with $42 mil-
lion of federal stimulus funds,

ggwhich are going‘ to the state-

iwrelated schools as a replacement

3 for the budget cuts Rendell made

0 previously. And while the move,

is certainly a good gesture, it may
be a classic case of too little, too
« late.
Even though Rendell’s pro-
posal theoretically brings the
, budgets of the state—related
schools back in line with their
' pre—cut estimates, Pitt spokesman
: Robert Hill said that it’s too early
I to tell whether or not Pitt will ex-
’ perience a tuition hike. However,
’ Penn State’s president Graham
4» Spanier told reportersiyesterday
, that Penn State students could
 still expect a tuition increase be-
tween 4.5 percent and 5.5 per-
cent, and it’s difﬁcult to see why
j Pitt should be any different.
i The problem is that the mon-
j ey only brings the budgets of the
 schools back to where it would
i have been had the state not cut
: out any funding. It doesn’t pro-
‘. vide anvyaddidonal relief, anclmr

like the tuition relief act, it gives _
the money directly to the univer- A
sities rather than to students and '

their families.

If nothing else, this grant is a i

Band-Aid measure, a temporary
ﬁx to a persistent problem. Penn-

sylvania has consistently given _

less and less money to state-re-
lated universities every year, and

right now state appropriations .

only make up about 11 percent
of Pitt’s annual budget.

The fact that Rendell was will— .

ing to cut a good portion of that

money in his original budget, and -

is only giving it back with federal
stimulus money, should speak
volumes in itself. And considering
that state-related students also are
cut out of his tuition relief act,
it seems as though Pitt would be
better off as a private university.
We understand that it’s impor-

tant for Pennsylvania to have a '

balanced budget, and the cuts to
the state-related school funding

were part of a series of neces— —
, tration. As it turns its back on lib-

sary reductions in the budget as
a whole, but the federal stimulus
package isn’t going to be around

to rescue the schools from budget .
cuts every year. What’s Rendell’s _
plan for reducing tuition hikes at .

state-system universities after the
stimulus money is spent? _

It’s good that Rendell con-
sidered the state-related schools

when deciding how to divvy up 3

the stimulus money, but the fact

ties.

Giving the schools money that
he cut from their own budgets in
the ﬁrst place isn’t tuition relief,
it’s common decency. Calling it
anything else is a disservice to the

schools and students he’s short- 4:

Egalitarian C

 
  

by Giles Howard
Colunzniat

 

‘Egalitarianism has become the
watchword of the Obama adminis-

erty in favor of a potently ignorant
populism, the administration that
was elected to address the economic
troubles plaguing this nation has
stopped searching for solutions and
begun bribing the mob with bread

 and circuses. The latest play to the

populist hordes: universal health
care

The administration tells us that

 not only is universal health care pos-
remains that his administration 
has consistently slighted Pitt and f
the other state—related universi— 

sible, but it can be achieved without
any contribution from those it ben-
eﬁts.

But the money has to come ﬁ:om

: somewhere In President Barack

Obama’s plan, that somewhere is
the coffers of small businesses and
the pockets of successful working
Americans.

In a document on its health care
plans, the Obama administration
said it will fund its universal health
care plans by “rebalancing the tax
code ‘ so that the wealthiest ‘pay
more”

Who are these mystical wealthy
Americans who will fund our new

age of health and prospeﬁty? Why,
households with an income of
$250,000 or more a year, of course.

Obama’s “wealthy” make up 2
percent of the population, earn 24
percent of all income, pay 43 per-
cent of all federal taxes and, under
Obama’s’ plan, would also take up
the burden of the nation’s health
care costs. .

Obama’s health care plan repre-
sents an attempt to capitalize on the
new climate of class warfare that his
election initiated in this nation. The
wealthy have become an inhuman
abstraction in the rhetoric of the
Obama administration. They are the’
scapegoats of the economic crisis,
yet at the same time, plundering their
wealth has been identiﬁed as the sal-
vation of middle— and working-class
America.

, The short—term effects of
Obama’s health care plan are clear.
First, the successfulwill be penalized
for their accomplishments, and their
wealth will be redistributed to sub-
sidize the care of the indigent. Tax-
payers will be forced to subsidize the
health care of the uninsurable or the
chronically unwell A

This includes individuals who
should be provided for, people who,
through no fault of their own, are
unable to get private insurance be-
cause of a chronic disease. Howev-

are is not American

er, Obama’s plan for universal health
care will primarily force Americans
who live healthy lifestyles, who ex-
ercise regularly and eat well, to bear
the burden of the obese and the lazy
— a classiﬁcation of Americans far
more numerous than those who
carmot receive insurance, through
no fault of their own.

Americans who suffer from life-
style-related illnesses, such as heart
disease and adult-onset diabetes,
and people who smoke or are obese
would be the primary beneﬁciaries
of Obama’s plan. But these people
should never be cared for at the ex-
pense of the public, because 
problems are of their own creation.

In the short—term, such a plan
constitutes an un—American assault
on the liberty of the successful
as the government begins to take
money from them, not to defend
the nation or to provide for neces-
sary public works, but to subsidize
the mob. I I

More troubling is the fact that .

Obama’s long-term vision of an
egalitarian America is one where
people improve themselves only
to be penalized by the failures of

their neighbors and where the gov- '

ernrnent works to bring everyone
down to the level of the average.
Such a system deprives citizens of
an incentive for individual success

In international politics, image isn't everything

by Mason Herron

Columnidt

  

There is a commonly modiﬁed
and widely interpreted aphorism
that states, “Nations do not have
friends, they have interests.” Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhowefs sec-
retary of state, John Foster Dulles,
received scrutiny for sharing his
belief that “the United States of
America does not have friends, it
has interests.” ‘

W/ith talk of a renewed U.S. irn—
age, this observation has become
critically relevant. The Obama ad-
ministration should approach diplo-
macy with the goal of competency
and effectiveness rather than ideal-
ism. We must forego the notion of
utopian international cooperation
in exchange for a much more prag-
matic and realistic approach to inter-
national relations, and our successes
must not revolve around a goal of
popular image. They must be sub-
stantial and conclusively within our
direct and immediate interest.

Nation-states do what is in their
best interest — militarily or eco-
nomically — regardless of ideologi-
cal sentiments. There are exceptions
throughout history to be sure — the
19905 contained many — but these
lonely exceptions only illuminate
the authority of the maxim.

History is rife with examples of
this behavior: Europe in the middle

18”‘ century. the Balkan wars pre- '

ceding World War I, the United
States and the Soviet Union dur-
'  and after \X/orld War II or US.
support of Saddam Husseinin the
’80s. These are instances of nations

operating as allies with former en-

emies and vice versa.,

The climate of international re-
lations is not‘ that of a playground.
Nations do not act in consideration
of personal affections or grudges.
Italy will not snub Germany be-
cause Germany talked to Norway,
nor will Turkey ally itself with Italy
based on the attractiveness of the
other’s statesmen.

What this all means then is that
the U.S. image abroad is immaterial
within relations between states. With

a new president, there is a tempta-
tion to believe that the European
powers or other allies will be more
willing to work with the United
States in order to achieve common
goals. Former President George W
Bush has been castigated for tar-
nishing the US. '-image abroad, and

a lack of an international solution

to the world’s problems has often,

been portrayed as Bush’s fault.

But this is not true. The prob-
lems of . reaching international so-
lutions are not "based out of any
personal animosity but rather by a
difference iniperceptions. The Iraq
war is a prime example of this.

Germany, France and the other
nations that didn’t participate in the
war simply didn’t perceive their se-
curity interests in the same way the
United States or United Kingdom
did. ‘

France approached the Iraq
war with a grander vision of in-
ternational relations. Its history —
something which greatly inﬂuences
foreign policy —— is full of instances
in which a balance of power was

seen as the most effective course

People should care for themselves

Howard, page 6

and self—improvement It turns the
excellent into a casualty of the me-
diocre. H

But the value of the free market,
which Obama is so subtly  to

' destroy, is that it allows the intel-

ligent, the vigorous and the exem-
plary to triumph over the ignorant,
the lazy and the average.

This is why the best and most
practically educated people in our
society, including the very doctors
whose small businesses and eco-
nomic liberties would be swallowed

whole by socialized medicine, are in
that top 2 percent of households
Obama identiﬁes as wealthy.

The market rewards them for
developing skills such as surgery or
dentistry, which are both in high de-
mand and remarkably complex. It
does not reward someone without a
high school diploma, nor should it.

James Madison wrote, “That is
not a just government, nor is prop-
erty secure under it, where the prop-
erty which a man has in his personal
safety and personal liberty, is violat-

ed by arbitrary seizures of one class
of citizens for the service of the
rest.” Madison and the rest of this
nation’s founding fathers initiated a
war to establish a just government
on these principles. They have guar-
anteed American liberty for more
than 200 years.

Let us not, in our fear and an-
ger, allow Obama to supplant this
American liberty with un-American
egalitarianism. “

of action. France, along with Ger-
many, attempted this same balance
of power approach to the Iraq war,
with a desire to create a stronger
EU and a counterweight against the
United States.

Terrorism, notably, is outside of
this approach. Terrorists operate on
a much more irrational mentality,
one based mostly upon ideology
with little regard to self-interest.
Blaming Bush’s image or attitude
for an intensiﬁed terrorist mentality
is enticing, but one must recall that
Sept. 11 occurred eight months into
Bush’s presidency —- his image, if it
even existed, had yet to materialize.

The rage expressed by terrorists
was not fostered by Bush’s lead-
ership, but originated in a deeply
ingrained ideological difference
rooted in differences of religion
and values. Expecting terrorism to
diminish simply through a change
in leadership is dangerously foolish.

Diplomatic success then rests
in an ability to provide convincing
and legitimate arguments that illu-
minate the beneﬁts of a potential
action or pursuit Bush’s diplomatic

failure was that he failed to present
an alluring case for an intervention
in Iraq. The interests of France and
Germany, if they were to be found
at all, were not adequately outlined
by the Bush administration.

The costs of the Iraq war illus-
trate the folly of directing foreign
policy without consideration of
direct self-interest. Policies enacted
with a desire for the spread of de-
mocracy or prevention of future
war can be labeled as interest-serv-
ing with only tenuous reasoning.
Indeed, the same can be. said of
nations that pursue or avert poli-
cies based upon approval ratings or
vague concepts of image.

The difﬁculty found in all of
this rests in understanding what is
and what is not an interest. Find-
ing the correct balance between the
extremes of imperialism and iso-
lationism takes creativity and fore-
sight. The determination of when
to use force must take into account
whether the nation using it will be
incontrovertibly better off.

separating reality from the imagi-

International Film Festival, “Fac-

“Realism in cinema is differ-

There is a blurred line between
ﬁction and documentary. There

the festival’s director and assistant

Selecting the range of ﬁlms to

Lion watched about 100 ﬁlms

said.

The event’s goal is to “ques—

music demands to be appreciated uniquely. H
Dancers, poets and. visual displays bring
the music "into sync with other art forms,
often asking the audience to take the sound
and transform it into something more.
Stephanie Rael, the -group’s ‘publicist
and wife of percussionist Eliseo Rael, said,

1 “They integrate different media with each V

other to make it into a more ‘fully rounded
experience.” _ Music alone cannot capture
everything, she said, so this “is a different
way to engage the audience.” ‘ V
The pieces this weekend include Joh

A_dam’s “American Berserk,” a “high—en-
ergy work for virtuoso pianist,” according
to his'\Web site. Dancers from KnotDance
will _need to push their bodies form the
-staccato bursts of "notes in this piece. You’ll
also enjoy Eric Moe’s “Superhero,” setting
the stage for seeing “Watchmen.” .

Those staying in Pittsburgh for spring

the word and share music — or, in a very rare
moment, offer criticism. Colligan, however,

'hadn’t seen the latter become a problem.
' “Whether there’s good or bad publicity, ‘

that’s still getting your name out,”_ said Col-
ligan. “There’s a lot of people who can’t make '
it to our shows. There’s still kids secluded in
their rooms clicking on MySpace all daylong,

_and that’s the best way to get your name out

there.” ' . p _
MySpace ‘hosts samples from The Cab’s

As No. 3 Pitt gets ready to
close out the regular season this

‘ week, Pitt coach Jamie Dixon can
i look back on what has been a rel-

atively healthy year.
’This is especially true when
Pitt is compared to other teams,
as Dixon is one of three coaches
"in Division‘ I‘ basketball to have
the same five players start in ev-

ferent.

pretty steady here’: .

That consistency has helped
propel the Panthers (26—3, 1343
Big East) into a powerhouse team
that’ could take the No. 1 overall’
seed in the‘ NCAA Tournament.

I But while this year has been
without any major injuries, Dixon
is all too familiar with the difficul-

' ties of having his players out.

Top 10 reasons why Pirates will be better in '09

by Robbie Kleinmuntz
Staﬂ Writer

Mid-February means one thing
for Pittsburgh Pirates fans: Only
another month and a half until the
team is near the bottom of the di-
vision.

Last year, however, Tampa Bay
Rays fans were probably think-
ing the same thing. The truth is, in
April every team still has a chance.
Here are the top 10 reasons why Pi-
rates fans should have hope for the
upcoming season.

10. Starting pitcher Paul Ma-
holm is coming off his best season.
Not because he struck out Billy
Crystal, but rather his 3.71 earned
run average in 31 starts. He is in the
prime of his career, which is good
news for the Pirates and their fans.

9. The Pirates now have World
Series experience. Eric Hinske, for-
merly of Tampa Bay, signed with
the team. They seem to anticipate
him being the opening day left
ﬁelder, which adds a veteran with
power to the lineup. Hinske totaled
at least 60 RBIs  ﬁve of his seven

seasons.

8. When Pittsburgh traded Ja-
son Bay and Xavier Nady last sum-
mer, Pirates fans were devastated.
That quickly changed when start-
ing pitcher Jeff Karstens was just
four outs away from throwing a
perfect game against the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Aug. 6. Karstens
can easily become the ace of this
staff and will be one of the reasons
why Pirates pitching will be better
this season.

7. For years, the organization
looked to have a strong minor
league system, and now the ‘time
has finally come. Twenty-year-old
outﬁelder Jose Tabata, who also
came over from the New York
Yankees in the Nady trade, is just
one of many—Andrew McCutch-
en, Brandon Moss, Andy LaRoche,
Steve Pearce, Pedro Alvarez, Nyjer
Morgan — who show a lot of
promise for the team’s future.

6. Another reason why the start-
ing pitchingwill be better is because
Ian Snell and Tom Gorzelanny
cannot pitch any worse than they
did last season. Their numbers

don’t need to be repeated, there’s
no place to go but up. Both Snell
and Gorzelanny had ERAS under
four in 2007, but the problem was
that the Pirates weren’t: getting pro-
duction from anyone else in the
rotation. If these guys can put up
numbers equivalent to 2007, the
rotation will have serious depth.

People quickly forget that second
baseman Freddy Sanchez was
the 2006 National League
batting champion. He was also
the only Pirate to make it to the
2007 All-Star game.

RE’?

5. Last year, catcher Ryan
Doumit started the season split-
ting time with Ronny Paulino. He
finished the season with 15 home
runs and a .318 batting average. In
2006, he had six home runs and a
.208 batting average and nine home
runs and a .274 batting average. So
his statistics keep going up every

’ dous power from both sides of the

plate and will play a key role if the
Pirates generate any success this
season. j_

4. Matt Capps didn’t blow a
save last year until June 10. He is
one of the most underrated closers
in the game. However, a shoulder
injury caused him to miss nearly
two months last season, and too
many games were blown during
that span. A healthy Capps will lead
to many more victones. '

_ 3. People quickly forget that
second baseman Freddy Sanchez
was the 2006 National League bat-
ting champion. He was also the
only Pirate to make it to the 2007
All-Star game. So shouldn’t he be
Pittsburgh’s most—valuable player?

Last year, he was never 100-
percent healthy and still had a .271
batting average, but people started
to write him off Sanchez should
be expected to have a bounce-back

year.

2. The NL Central is up for
grabs. Sure, the Chicago Cubs -are
heavy favorites going in, but after

 

last year’s post-season collapse,;-
who knows how many years it will
take that team to recover. Not to
mention, the Milwaukee Brewers
no longer have their ace, CC Sa-
bathia. It seems as if all the teams
are heading in the wrong directiongv
so the Pirates have just as good a
chance as anyone.

1. The Pirates still have Nate
McLouth. “Nate the Great” simply
has it all. He began last season with
a 19—game  streak.

He was the Pirates’ representa-
tive for the All-Star Game last year
where he proved he can perform
in the.biggest games. During that
game, he made a clutch throw from
center ﬁeld in the 10th  that‘
cut down the potential game-win-
ning run for the American League.
Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Rus-
sell Martin later commented that
McLouth’s throw was “perfect.”
He also won the 2008 Gold Glove
Award and the 2008 Roberto Cle-
mente Award.

~ As long as McLouth is on the
team, fans have a player to antici-

pate watching.

Other days, it’s more Olympic weight-
lifting moves that use high-weight totals to
help develop the metabolism and localize
strength building.

It all started when Miller was a sopho-

was when he saw the movie “300” that he

fornia this July. Winner gets the title of “ﬁt— .

test man or woman on Earth.”
For Miller, Crossﬁt has become alifestyle
that transcends simply staying in shape.
The discipline he’s developed from his
workouts has carried over into other facets
of his life, from proper dieting to school
work.
“The development is broad. You be-
come more diligent,” he said. “It’s with
schoolwork or a leader-

soon, his friends started
to follow, beginning with
Max Schultz, a friend of Miller’s since their
freshman year.

“I started [Crossﬁt] to get rid of a little
gut,” said Shultz. “Now when it’s a day to
run a 10k [6.2 miles], it’s nothing.’ Crossﬁt
gives you a ready state to compete in any-
thing.”

Soon the following swelled to 10 others.
Now it’s about 15 depending on the week-
end, and Miller and Schultz are competing
in Crossﬁt events around the country.

In September of this past year, Miller

After ﬁnal exams this April, both plan
on heading to Virginia Beach to compete in

“Housewives do this.
Grandmothers and sol-
diers do this,” said Miller.

But on this particular Saturday, as Miller
and his club go from station to station do-
ing a workout dubbed “Fight Gone Bad”
— a workout designed to simulate the
physical demands of a mixed martial arts
ﬁght while exceeding metabolic demands
——- he isn’t thinking about that.

Miller is far too focused on the task at
hand and challenges immediately in front
of him.

Amid the ballistic acoustic of physical
percussion that permeates the room — the
grunts, yells for help and weights clanging
— Miller’s face remains acute and ﬁerce.

This is his life, and it is happening one
workout at a time.

Marquette,

PDayton — an injury that caused him to
miss the next 14 games.

When Cook and Fields went down last
season, Dixon turned to Ronald Ramon
and Keith Benjamin off the bench. His

.-,senior guards helped pace the season for
the Panthers.

Dixon said that when a player is hurt,
it affects the rotation in more ways than
most might think. That’s. because someone
who might not have had a lot of experi-

Connecticut hurt by major injuries

ence must replace the player who replaces
the injured player.

“You have to look at the guy who re-
places the guy who [was injured],” said
Dixon. “That’s almost more important.”

For Pitt, the biggest scare might have
come during its last game against Seton

,Hall when sophomore DeJuan Blair left

the game after a collision. But his return
five minutes later put to rest any question
on his status, and Dixon expects him to

play Wednesday.

Without any major injuries on the team,
sophomore Brad Wanamaker doesn’t see
any difference in the amount of contact
in practice compared to last year, meaning
that sometimes, the injuries can just turn
out to be bad luck.

“[Coach Dixon] keeps it balanced,” said I

Wanamaker. “Everything we do is com-
petitive and hard. We’re just staying healthy
this year.”

  Student Travel alert for Mexico

. Excerpts from the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs website:
'* htti>://travel.state.2ov/travel/cis__pa_tw/pa/pa__3028.html#

. This information is current as of Monday, Mar 02, 2009 10:17:27 GMT-0500 (EST).

This Travel Alert (February 20, 2009) updates security information for U. S. citizens traveling and living in Mexico.
It supersedes the Travel Alert for’ Mexico dated October 15, 2008, and expires on August 20, 2009.

While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year (including thousands who cross the land border every
day for study, tourism or business), violence in the country has increased recently. it is imperative that travelers
understand the risks of travel to Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and whom to contact if one be-
comes a crime victim. Common-sense precautions such as visiting only legitimate business and tourist areas.dur-
ing daylight hours, and avoiding areas where prostitution and drug dealing might occur, can help ensure that travel

- US. citizens who believe they are being targeted for kidnapping or other crimes should notify Mexican officials and the nearest
American consulate or the Embassy as soon as possible, and should consider returning to the United States. -

- U.S. citizens should make every attempt to travelon main roads during daylight hours, particularly the toll ("cuota“) roads,

- U.S. citizen visitors are encouraged to stay in the well-known tourist areas of the cities. Travelers should leave their itinerary
with a friend or family member not traveling with them, avoid traveling alone, and should check with their cellular provider prior
to departure to confirm that their cell phone is capable of roaming on GSM or 3G international networks. Do not display expen-
sive-looking jewelry, large amounts of money, or other valuable items.

- U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during
late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports. ‘

- U.S. citizens are urged to be alert to safety and security concerns when visiting the border region.

- U.S. citizen victims of crime in Mexico are urged to contact the consular section of the nearest U.S. consulate or Embassy for
advice and assistance. Contact information is provided at the end of this message. .

- During demonstrations or law enforcement-operations, U.S. citizens are advised to remain in their homes or hotels, avoid large
crowds, and avoid the downtown and surrounding areas. Since the timing and routes of scheduled marches and demonstra-
tions are always subject to change, US. citizens should monitor local media sources for new developments and exercise ex~
treme caution while within the vicinity of protests. The Mexican Constitution prohibits political activities by foreigners, and such
actions may result in detention and/or deportation. U.S. citizens are therefore advised to avoid participating in demonstrations
or other activities that might be deemed political by Mexican authorities. As is always the case in any large gathering, U.S. citi-
zens should remain alert to their surroundings.

To see the entire travel alert, and for detailed information for staying safe in
Mexico as well as consulates and consular agencies please go to the following website:

httvzl/travel.state.2ov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa__3028.html#

ihis announcement is brought to you by the University of Pittsburgh Division of Studenmﬁairs.

The same can’t be said for No. 1 Con-
necticut, which lost starting guard Jerome
Dyson to a knee injury.

This goes for No. 13 Marquette, which
Pitt hosts Wednesday. _

The Golden Eagles (23-6, 12-4) lost
senior guard Dominic James to a broken
foot after he played only four minutes in
their 93-82 loss at Connecticut on Feb. 25.
James, who averaged 11.4 points per game
this season, is out for the rest of the sea-
son. ‘

Still, the Panthers aren’t taking Mar-
quette lightly. Last year, Pitt was in a similar
battle against injuries but went on to upset
Georgetown in the Big East Champion-

ship.

Everything we do is competi-
tive and hard. We're just staying
healthy this year. '

Brad -
Wanamaker

“I don’t want to say they’re a different
team [without James],” said’ Wanamaker
about Marquette. “They have players that
are ready to step up  [Maurice] Ackers
has been playing all year, so I think he’s
comfortable with stepping up and playing
as good as Dominic James had been.”

With two games left in the regular sea-
son and a chance to clinch a two—day bye
in the Big East tournament, Dixon said the
team is focusing on the rest of its games

i one at a time.

Injuries or not, Dixon said it’s impor-
tant for the players to focus on one thing.

‘You just try to play your best basket-
ball,” he said. “That’s the bottom line.”
