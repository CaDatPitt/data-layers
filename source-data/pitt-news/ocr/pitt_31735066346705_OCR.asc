Tap Day Speaker Lists Student Responsibilities

Firestone Sees Campus ‘Vacuum’

By MATT SWETONIC

Nathan Firestone, speaking at
Thursday’s Tap Day dinner, called
attention to the “existence of a
spiritual vacuum“ on the Univer-
sity campus.

“Students,” he stated. “are bru-
tally shocked by massive lethargy
and far from helping to overcome
it, they actually contribute to it."
In seeking a correction to this
“disease,” Firestone called upon
students “to demonstrate their
maturity and capibility to accept
responsibility.”

He divided student responsibil-
ity into three separate areas: the
academic realm, campus activities,
and world political areas; and
then proceeded to examine each
separately.

With our “questionable aca-
demic standa-rds,”‘ remarked
Firestone, “we have to do every-
thing but apply ourselves to the
serious task of true academic at-
tainment. The priority is on
grades and on personal recogni-
tion, and not on honest intellec-
tual accomplishment.

“Perhaps,” he mused, “it would
be wise for us to regress to the
old-fashioned idea of learning-form
learning’s sake, and to discard one
of our most cherished 20th century
American. academic traditions -
“How to get a bigger and better
(A9,?! ‘

Commenting on campus‘activi-
ties, Firestone made reference to
their improper perspective, poor
leadership which makes. “their
aims and purposes seem petty and
insignificent to most of the student
body," ;and the pollution of these
activities “by a swarm of “well
rounded’ parasites who skip hap-
hazardly from one to another leav-
ing nothing in their destructive
wake but internal strife.

Tech Professor
To Discuss
Salinger Books

“J. D. Salinger: A Reputation
and a Promise,” will be the topic
of the next review to be held at
the BockCenter. Mrs. Ann Louise
Hayes, assistant professor of En-
glish at Carnegie Institute of
Technology‘, will present her
views on Salinger at the review
which is scheduled for Wednes-
day at 4:15 p.m. in the Fine Books
Room. A

Graduating in English summa
cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa,
Mrs, Hayes received her AB. and
H.A. at Stanford University.

She has taught English at
Stanford, Indiana University, and
Coe College. She has been at

Carnegie Tech since 1957. Some
of Mrs. Hayes poetry appears in
a 1949 collection, “Poets of the
Paciﬁc: Second Series,” which
was edited by Yvor Winters.

Mrs. Hayes will begin her talk
by discussing “The Catcher in the
Rye," a book which has become
required reading for many col-
lege students. She will then com-
ment on Sa1i’nger’s“‘Nine Stories”
and will conclude with a discus-
sion on the stories which make
up the Glass Family sequence.
"Franny and Zooey" is a part of
this sequence.

———-.. .... -

TAP" DAY SPEAKER Nathan Firestone lashed out at the “perpet-
ual joiner" who belongs to eight or nine organizations and sug-
gested that the student whojoins only a few organizations is more
of an asset to the University and his fellow students.

as at 4:

“It is necessary," continued
Firestone, “for the leaders of our
major organizations to sink their
teeth into University-wide issues
that need attention, and that will
reflect the opinions and wants of
all the students."

Firestone next attacked the
perpetual “joiner" calling atten-
tion to the fact that “no student
can make any significent contri-
bution to a host of ‘activities
and still do justice to his aca-
demic endeavors. The harm
they do, both to the activity and

O 4 at
to themselves is intangible but,
nevertheless, huge.”

Politically speaking Firestone
questioned whether “it is too much
to ask that our ‘reputable’ student
leaders occasionally do some ser-
ious thinking about world affairs
and‘ initiate proper action? It is
new time for us to become the
spokesmen of their University, in-
stead of having outsiders think
that Pitt is a hot-bed for a reac-
tionary conservatism, or a haven
for dreamy liberals.”

But they must strut their hour

which relies entirely on the impact

Wlritlrer leaders?

_.F0r the past year the emphasis on campus has been for
reorganization —- structural adjustment to the trimester
program. But it wasn’t until Thursday evening that per-
sonal adjustment was suggested as the real problem facing
student leaders and their organizations.

Nate Firestone, in his Tap Day address, Pointed Out theft
the present problem is centered within students and their
purposes. The intellectual life of the student is out of per-

spective, and because of this students have become dis-

illusioned with activities per se. Mr. Firestone thinks the
answer to the organization problem is a return to academic
achievement -— not the kind measured in grades, but true
understanding and intellectual development.

In order to achievethis goal, he feels that a stronger
interest among all student leaders, especially in national
and international affairs should be promoted, and that all
areas, Student Government in particular should concen-

‘ trate on problems‘ pertinent to» all students, not just those

factions who need help in attaining their goals.

Mr. Firestone_’s analysis of the problem was excellent
and put into words a movement that has had many weak
beginnings over the past few years. Gradually, more and
more political organizations. have been formulated and
taken an active role on campus. More important,however,
are those programs such as the Student Union ‘Forum Se-
ries which present objective analyses of major events.

Unfortunately, student attendance at such perform-
ances are sadly lacking —- total 30 on a good day. Publicity
has been the major obstacle under such circumstances. But
consider the problem as it actually exists. -

‘First step in presenting such a program involves ob-
taining a big name speaker or one reknown in his ﬁeld, one
who will “attract” people. Announcements appear in The
Pitt News often with front page coverage; bulletin boards
are covered» with literature and posters announcing the ar-
rival of the outstanding speakers, but still students shy away
from the thought-provoking events. But in no way can the
leaders determine where they have failed. Student apathy
becomes the charge. a

Mr. Firestone has made an outstanding contribution by
pointing out the obvious failure to vitally involve students
in all realms of activities -— activities which will be well
worth those students time.

But may we add that just initiating programs of this
sort will not solve the problem either. Student leaders must
believe in the programsto the extent that they do not only
coordinate them nor search extensively for speakers they
see have an impressive biography. They must have a vital
interest in the program for the sake of the program itself
before the so—called followers will join in.

Formal publicity can never have the results that per-
sonal enthusiasm accomplishes. No dogmatic pressure
groups are suggested here, but,_an honest interest in what
is being done and why.

An awareness of the problem is the ﬁrst step, and it
is those students who realize misplaced values who must
promote where they believe the true values lie. But as Dr.

omy isthatof the free market and whose fountain‘-
head is the individual. i

Liberals scoff at such concepts. As for conserva-

’ tives? They see both good and

bad in Rand. When I speak of‘
conservatives, I speak not ‘of the:
traditionalist nor the libertarian,
but, the contemporary conserva-
tive who is the partaker of the .
synthesis of the philosophy of ‘
traditional conservatism and the
ideology of libertarianism.

Ayn Rand is a novelist. And
because of this, she deals with
people and situations in order
to convey her major premise ‘
That is, that a state of liberty (that conditiqgn 0
being wherein coercion by the state and by in-
dividuals is eliminated completely) is feasible, and
most desirable. ‘

Model For Liberty L

In Anthem and in Atlas Shrugged, this concept
is conveyed magniﬁcently. The society of John Galt
is the model for this condition of liberty where
the individual enjoys the obvious beneﬁts of a free,
perfect, and productive society. For through the
utilization of the free market 'economyri.‘e. the free
play of supply and demand, the individual is able,
without the restraint of government, to surpass the
frontiers of knowledge which have been stagnated
by the desire of the state to have everyone equal.
In Anthem, the mother state hasireduccd the finest
minds to the position of street cleaner, and, will
not accept advances in science because of the fear
of resultant inequality. The street cleaner escapes

   

with a female potato picker (also a ﬁne mind) and

they live happily ever after. I ; A .

I as a contemporary conservative feel that Ayn

' Rahd has much to offer. But she is misleading and,
therefore not a constructive contribution to the

conservative—libertarian synthesis or the ranks of
the conservative movement. The contemporary con-
servative believes that man is capable of good and
bad, given his free will to choose, the result is
good. In such a society, John Galts are all other
men, a perfect man.

There is a hitch to this “Whatever turns to gold”
attitude. Man throughout history has shown that

-if given half a chance to use his free will, he will

do that which benefits him most. If, therefore, he

must sacriﬁce the right of his neighbor in order to‘ '

execute his free will in‘order to satisfy some de-
sire, he will do so. Unless there exists some au-
thority to hinder him. Or some sense of right and
wrong to sway him. Rand sees no needfor morality
or for authority.
We Disagree

This is where the contemporary conservative
and Ayn Rand, disagree. Although I applaud 'Rand’s
individualism and her championing of the free
market economy, the state of liberty for me is
not the state of anarchy. It is the condition of be-

ingwherein coercion is reduced as much as possi-

ble. The Judaic and Christian norms of our culture
are not museum pieces, but standards which play
an important part in balancing the scales between
authority and liberty. For Society is seen by the
contemporary conservative as being in ‘constant
tension between authority and liberty. The con-
temporary conservative feels that today the au-
thoritarian side is too heavy. Buthe admits that

By Richard J. Bishir!ian--—-I

-the libertarian side can weigh too heavy.

Letters tothe Editor

. Replies To Hufnagel *

Editor, The Pitt News:_

It would be quitenatural for
me to begin this little essay in
the form of a letter and say,
“Dear Jim,” because you seem
like such a ﬁne young man -
one with good understanding,
good manners and common sense.

Your column in the Pitt, News
of March 5 gave me quite a jolt.
It never occurred to me that some
of the older students (in years)
acted so about their classes.

My experience since returning
for more education has been
quite different. Many times. it has
been necessary for me to hustle
quite lively to keep up with the
youngsters in my classes. Some-
times they have gotten ahead of

me.

I glory in your achievements,

_ your abilitiesand your desire to

get ahead. More power to you!
When your generation now in the
colleges and universities, sets the
pace, it isn’t a slow believe me.
When the days of my college ex-
perience cometo mind they are as
nothing compared to yours.

I am now working for my de-
gree in education -— getting it

the hard way in evening classes-

but enjoying every minute of the
time. It isn’t easy to do after
teaching junior ‘high students all
day.

Now, this isn’t written to de-
fend the woman you wrote about
—only written to present a grown
woman teacher’s viewpoint. I am
married and the mother of two
grown daughters, the youngest
graduating from college this
spring.

Again let me say, I would not
flaunt before any group of stu-
dents myexperience. I will state
my Jiewpoints on pertinent mat-
ters and would listen to the views
and philosophies of others, young
or old. I never resent mingling
with those younger than ‘I but at
the same time I don’t wish to

Students Question

Ray Reave's ‘Selection’

Editor, The Pitt News: ‘a
First we would like to say that
Ray Reaves is not a sweet boy
with an attractive personality. If
he were, he would not have writ-

ten the letter appearing in The
Pitt News of March 7."

Our question is whether Mr.
Reaves, mature University senior
and learned student of political
science and governmental theory,

is capable of deciding for us who»

would or would not dc a good
job as Student Government vice
president.

Miss MaGuire w-as willing to
run, and Mr. Reaves admits she
“has proven herself a good work-

er.” Student Government needs
workers — not just idealistic
planners.

We know neither Miss Maguire
nor Miss Diethorn but we respect
anyone willing to run. V

Mr. Reaves suggests electing a
team of leaders, but election is
the process of selection, and who
could we select for President?
Thomas Olofson? No. We could
not select him; Reaves and his
machine had already enthroned
him. But we could have elected
a vice president. Did We?

wasn’t simple-minded enough to
believe everything was right in

ough to believe everything was

' longer with us, but I’m sure many

“average” Americans still exist.

There appear to be many or-
ganizations on campus which
seem dedicated to showing us
what is wrong with our country.
There is nothing wrong with this,
more especially if the criticism is
constructive in. nature,.I also do
not wish to imply we lack many
ﬁne organizations at Pitt, but their
views, in the main, are singular
in nature. .

I would like to see a group
formed which would be dedicated
to the evaluation of what is good
in this country as opposed to the
llegative approach. We could call
it the WRAAA (What’s Right
About ‘America Association), or
perhaps you could suggest a more
suitable name. _

Based on such a“ theme, I am
sure we could attract speakers of
outstanding caliber from the
ﬁelds of business, labor, religion,

,P01i’€ics,.etc., and thus be in a

better position to obtain an un-

derstanding of existing conditions

from Varying points of view.

 pace Grant Given

To School Physicist

The National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA)
has approved a grant for $61,340 to help promote a Univer-
sity team of scientists who are trying to determine whether
or not life as we know it exists in outer space.

The money will be used for a three year project for

lprbuilding a biological-detecting device called a microspectro-

 photometer.

signed to detect, measure and re-
b'cbrd light sensitivity of organic
imolecules, or parts of living cells,
in outer space.

Principal investigator for the re-
search team is Dr. J. J. Wolken of
the School of Medicine and the
Biophysics Laboratory at Eye and
Ear Hospital. Other departments
at the University will be collabor-
ating on the ‘project.

Dr. Wolken and his stat.‘ have
been studying light-sensitive
areas of the retina for the past
seven years, and as a result,
have developed a complicated
microspectrophotometer to ob-
serve chemical changes in pig-

. }rments within single living cells.

The device, however, is too large
to be placed in a space ship. The
goal of the NASA project is to
miniaturize, the present machine
to the size of a table model radio
without losing any of its eﬂ‘i-
ciency.

Other modiﬁcations, including
the automation of "the data re-
cording process, wil be introduced.

Dr. Wolken added that, in ad-
dition to searching for life in outer

space, the device would also be
 seful to scientists conducting
 ceanographic research.

LA Probation
Figure Drops
F or Wiiiter

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, Assistant
Chancellors Student and General
Affairs, has released figures for

- the students placed on probation

in various schools for’ low aca-
demic standards during fall Tri-
mester. ‘

The School of Libert Arts has
30.2 percent of its enrolled student
body on probation and the School
of Engineering and Mines 19.7 per-
cent. 28.1 percent of the total
freshmen class is on probation.

Dr. Albert B. Martin, dean of
School of Liberal Arts, said that
he is not happy about the high
number of probationaries but the
figure this year reflect a decrease
over the past years.

“There are so‘ many students on
probation because the University
has adopted a policy to ‘toughen
up’ its academic policy and im-
prove standards for which it is
well known. Raymond Fitter dean
of the School of Engineering and
Mines had no comments.

The office of Chancellor has
released figures comparing the
scholastic ability of entering
freshmen for 1958 and 1961. In
1958 the number of freshmen
with a 650 or better in the Scho-
lastic Aptitude Tests were 3 per-
cent for Verbal and 7 percent‘
for the written exams as com-
pared to 6.2 percent verbal and
12 percent for the written exams
in 196l.— '

In 1958, freshmen accepted at

the University were, 46 percent
from the top fifty, 30 percent from
the second fifth, 15 percent from
the middle fifth, and 5 percent
from the fourth fifth of their class.
Last year these figures were 56
percent from the top fifth, 29 per-
cent from the second fifth, 10 per-
cent from" the middle fifth and 3.4
percent from the fourth fifth.

A LOST WEEKEND

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—-A deeply hurt Rex Peery must
have had the arteries to his heart slashed when he squirmed
powerlessly in his chair as Rich Martin, an apparent invulner—
able 123—pound defending champion, succumbed to cocky
Curt Merriam of Lehigh in the EIWA ﬁnal round at Penn
State’s. Rec Hall here.

A distraught Martin slouched into a corner away from
the crowd, bewildered by the turn of circumstances as well as
the turn of hectic holds on the spotlighted mat. At the outset
of his match, Merriam scored a quick reversal on Martin in
a reckless tumble, and Martin’s championship form stole
away in the infringement on his superiority.

“I just felt like I lost,’’ Martin‘ mumbled, his“eyes empty
and bordered by plum-colored, battered tissue. 1, want an-
other chance at him.” Martin will get that chance at the

. NCAA tourney in Stillwater, Oklahoma, March 16-17. “It has

not altered my plans,” Martin, exclaimed, “I’m still going after
the national championship.” , ,

Sliampion Loser _

At the culmination of theﬁnal round when the silver
serving bowls were given to the outstanding wrestlers to get
them started in housekeeping, Martin plucked off, one of the
best. He won the Fletcher Memorial Trophy, symbolic of the
man who has been most valuable to his team in three years
of competition. ‘ ‘

“There aren’t many guys who can lose,” Martin said,
wryly, “and still win an award.” Martin is such a sincere
athlete with a poised, and digniﬁed carriage that even the
crude Lehigh following - cheered him heartily for his
gameness. This is like Nero, the fellow who ﬁddled about
Rome, getting a curtain call at Carnegie Music Hall.

Meanwhile, villain Merriam, was reputed to have been
tough with the press, turning his back on Daily Collegian
writers the night before in arrogance. “I don’t want to say
anything to the press,” the bespectacled titlist blared.

“If you are a’ champion,” I replied,l"you would have
the courtesy to speak to the press.”

“Well, I’m not used to such things,” he snarled, “I’ll just
have to learn to live with it for awhile.” Finally, he was
gracious enough to speak, “It’s something to beat Martin,”
said‘Merriam, “Without saying anything for myself; When
you’re a sophomore it’s hard to wrestle anybody, and when
Martin beat me last year, he really beat me.”

Mike Johnson, Martin’s heir apparent, was off in the
wings,‘a silent, yet meaningful stare. Johnson would like to
avenge the loss next year, and he may well might.

Quiet Explosion «

I In the 137-pound class, Pitt’s John Zolikoff lost in over;
time. It was over time that Zolikoff should “shoot the works,
but he preferred caution, and to quote Brute Kramer, “he who
hesitates is lost.” .

He was beaten by a Navy man, Mike Harman, whose
coach is Ed Peery, former three-time NCAA champion at Pitt.
“When Navy wrestles Pitt, it’s Navy—~now,” said the younger
Peery. “It’s kinda tough to see Dad lose. He hates to lose,
but so do I. I feel bad when those Pitt kids lose because I
helped to coach some of them two years ago.” ,

Daryl Kelvington’s “wrestling was a thing of
beauty,” according to Hugh Peery, another _ of the
former Peery champs. “D.K.” smothered Ron Pifer, the
defending champ from Penn State‘. This he did in spite
of the fact that Pifer has beaten Kelvington several
times, ever since his early high school days.

Sophomore Kenny Barr was the only other Panther in
the ﬁnal go, and he‘ bowed to Lehigh’s senior, Jim Detrixhe,
a two-time champ. Detrixhe clamped Barr with his vice-like
grip the same as he did earlier in Pittsburgh and he broke
down Barr better than any rodeo man. But Barr. certainly
distinguished himself this year with his outstanding 10-2-1
mark.

Rex Peery said this of his boys: “They were really
in there ﬁghting for it when they lost. Too bad, that’s all.”
What does Peery think of Lehigh’s chances in the Na-
tionals? “They’ll just go out there,” Peery mumbled, “and
fade like they did in Oregon last year, I guess.”

When Lehigh’s Coach Jerry Leeman was asked if Lehigh
had ﬁnally vindicated their supremacy over Pitt, he’ smiled,
“We did‘ it more convincing than the. other time. It s unbe-
lievable. It’s amazing. Butwe earned it and we deserved it.

While Leeman was accepting handshakes, ﬁremen were

Martin Upset
In Final Round
Kelvington lst

By BOB SMIZIK

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. ....
Lehigh made the 58 annual
Eastern Intercollegiate Wrest-
ling Association Champion-
ship Tournament. a one team
affair as theyswept six of the

nine first places, including a near
unbelievable upset of Rich Mar-
tin, and set a new team scoring
record by posting 96 points. Pitt
finished a disappointing and dis-
mal second with 69 points, and
only Daryl Kelvlngton won a, title.
Martin’s loss in the finals seem-
ed to give the Engineers the mo-
mentum they needed tocrush the
field even though they all but
won the title in the semi finals.

Both squads sent seven mend

into the semi-finals and going into
the crucial 167 pound about each
team had placed three. of _those
men in the finals and‘ had’ each
lost a man.
Exciting March
The 167 pound match pitted Jim

_Harrison against Dave Angell. In

the most thrilling match of the
tourney Angel] scored a 5-2 win
in overtime. .

The loss dropped the Panthers
far behind Lehigh, but the defi- ’
cit could have been made up it

"Tom Jeffries had beaten Chuck
Moore. He didn’t, losing 2-1 in
overtime and Lehigh all but
clinched the Tournament.
Jeffries wrestled" the same type
of match against Moore that he

hed earlier in the year. He seemed ,

to be afraid to try any offensive
moves and was warned for stalling
in regulation time. In the overtime
a stalling point was called against
him and this proved to be the de-
ciding point.
Six Finalists

Lehigh placed six men in the
finals and all of them came
through with firsts. Bill Mei'ria'm’s
7-6 _upset of Martin was Lehigh’s
first title and after that nothing,
not even six individual winners,
was a surprise.

Martin received some satis-
faction out of the tournament
as he won the John A. Fletcher
Memorial Trophy which is given
to the wrestler who has done the
most for his team during his
career in the Eastern tourney.

Aver three years Martin compil-

ed 37 points to edge Army's Al-

Rushatz and Angell by a single
tally.

Lehigh won the 130 pound title
when Pat Smart edged Navy‘s
Denny Farrar. 7

Mermeiii Hope For
Bid To Easterns

Although the curtain has come
down on the regular season for
the Panther swimmers, there‘ re-
mains a possibility that some of
the mermen will participate in
the Eastern Invitational‘Meet and
the ‘NCAA Championships.

The Eastern meet, which will
take place later this month at

Yale, does not decide team
champions, but only individual
winners. As yet, the Panthers

have not been invited to the at-
fair, but are still hopeful.

“We haven’t even mentioned

Stop ‘Redshirting’

The University of Pittsburgh
and three of its perenial football
rivals, Penn State, Syracuse and
West Virginia are contemplating
an agreement that would ban the
practice of “redshirting’ football
players.

According to Athletic Director
Frank Carver, “A formal agree-

In 1961, the National Collegiate A

Athletic Association adopted a
rule outlawing ‘redshirting’ for
more than one campaign. Confer-
ences have abandoned ‘redshirt-

the country, and it is highly prob-
able that in the future the prac-
tice will be done away with com-

“Even in today’s age of specialization, a man eventually
reaches a point where breadth of knowledge is necessary.
The engineer must understand accounting and marketing.
The marketing man must know his product. The financial
man must be sympathetic to engineering development
and sales programs. Management must have a working
knowledge of all phases of the complex and highly com-
petitive business world.

“Therefore, even though specializing, a student should
make his college curriculum as broad as possible, and
diversify his outside ‘activities. Authoritative surveys have
shown that only a small" percentage of individuals end up
in the field in which they specialized in college.

“Widen your world. Broaden your interests right now.
Since graduation from college I’ve discovered that those
who are really succeeding today are the ones who do more
and keep on learning from what they do. The broader
your college interests are now -~ the steadier your ladder
of success tomorrow!”
