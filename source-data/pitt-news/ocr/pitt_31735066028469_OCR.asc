Gambling on a physicist

Peter Koehler oversees College of Arts and Sciences

Tucked in the comer of a
diploma from Pitt's College of
Arts and Sciences is the signature
of a man not many students
know. They will only meet him
brieﬂy as they walk across the
stage at the Civic Arena to
receive the piece of parchment
certifying their graduation from
Pitt.

''I’m the one who signs your
diploma," laughs Dr. Peter
Koehler, dean of the faculty of
arts and sciences, when asked
what he does.

Koehler does more than sign
diplomas, though. Since the
restructuring of CAS in 1996,
Koehler has overseen both the
business and academic perfor-
mance of the school.

When Koehler was appoint-
ed dean of the faculty of arts and
sciences in 1986, he and the
school's administrators consid-
ered his appointment a "gamble."

' "I was certainly a nontradi-

tional candidate. I never climbed
the traditional college ranks,"
said Koehler. "If they wanted a
person steeped in the traditions of
a university, I wasn't that person.
But if they wanted someone with
a strong administrative back-
ground, then I think I'm that per-
son."

Typically, a college dean
begins his career in the class-
room. Koehler, however, started
his career as an assistant physi-
cist at the Argon National
Laboratory in Illinois. He also
worked for the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory, a nation-
al physics lab in Illinois.

Working for the Fermi lab
allowed Koehler to keep in touch
with the academic world,
because the institution provides
research assistance to universi-
ties throughout the country,
including Pitt.

"I've focused on research
and administration, not really
teaching, unless you count a brief
period as a teacher's assistant

here when I ﬁrst started," he said.
"When I was doing that, students
in my recitation thought it was
strange that a teacher's assistant
would have such a nice ofﬁce. It
didn't dawn on them as to who I
was until later."

Even though Koehler may
not have the usual background
associated with a college dean,
his colleagues maintain that he
has a commitment to Pitt's stu-
dents and faculty.

Dr. Frank Giarratani, associ-
ate dean for faculty affairs,
regards Koehler as a mentor.

"At the end of the day, you
can't but feel like you've learned
something from him," Giarratani
said.

Results .of an evaluation of
Koehler's work as dean for the
faculty of arts and sciences in
1996 described him as being
"respectable" and "pruden ."

"I am very impressed with
his work," said Rose Reynolds,
an administrative assistant in the

Top of the world: What's on
the Cathedral's 40th floor?

Jennifer Stoltz

Staff Wrlter

Within the towering structure of
the Cathedral of Learning lies a
secret. Or, at least some think so.

Most students know the eleva-
tors take passengers to the 36th
ﬂoor. But, what some may not know
is that the Cathedral actually ‘houses
40 floors. As for what's up there, not
many people know. Nor do many
know exactly how to get up to the
four highest ﬂoors.

The top ﬂoor of the Cathedral is
known as the Babcock Room. It was
named for Edward V. Babcock, the
former chairman and CEO of the
Babcock Lumber Company.

Babcock also founded that cor-
poration, which was headquartered
in Pittsburgh. It would later be
dubbed the "company of the [19th]

century."

So, how does one find his way to
the highest elevation in North
America’s tallest university build-
ing?

Around the corner from the
familiar bank of elevators on the
36th floor is another elevator — a
single, small, rather ominous-look-
ing one.

However, you can't just hop in it
and jet up four more floors. There's
a catch: The elevator is locked.

What makes this elevator, and
its ultimate destination, the Babcock
Room, so guarded? In the early sev-
enties, a group called Concerned
Students and Faculty requested per-
mission to attend a full meeting of
the board of trustees, whose presi-
dent at the time was Dr. Wesley
Posvar.

Their intention was supposedly

to discuss ways in which "the
University could disengage itself
from the clutches of corporate
power." Theywere denied permis-
sion to attend this meeting.

As a result, approximately 40

members of Concerned Students and
Faculty blocked the elevator leading
to the Babcock Room, and managed
to trap those trustees attending the
board meeting.

Germanic languages
department. "My only objection is that 
he has been slow to respond to some
issues. He knows the faculty and is con-
cerned with the needs of the students,
especially those of undergraduates."

Despite reservations like Reynolds’,
Koehler believes he has made some sig-
nificant contributions to Pitt, especially in
the area of tenure.

Koehler compared granting tenure to
giving someone a lifetime guarantee to
teach. Because tenure tends to be a per-
manent decision, Koehler said it requires
scrupulous evaluation of a person's work
in and out of the classroom.

"I think I have made the right deci-
sions in hiring and promoting. I've want-
ed to improve the quality of education,
and one way to do that is through making
the right decisions concerning tenure,"
Koehler noted.

Koehler decides to grant tenure based
on an instructor's research, colleagues‘
reviews and, most importantly, students’
evaluations.

"The evaluations are a chance for stu-
dents to say if a teacher is doing some-
thing right or not. If the students don't
take the time to respond, I'm left to guess
as to a professor's performance," he said.

Koehler will leave his position in
1998 to ﬁnally try his hand at teaching
physics. Before making the leap from
administrator to faculty member, he plans
on taking a year-long sabbatical. During
his year off, he'll cocreate a science
course for non—science majors.

"It's been a strange career. I was in
administration and now I'm going into
teaching, but it's a fascinating challenge,"
Koehler said. "I'm looking forward to
working with undergraduate studen ."

Koehler was born in Gennany in
1938 and grew up there during World War
II. Fortunately, his family was not greatly
affected by the conﬂict.

"My father was a forester, so I grew
up in a rural setting. Being in the country

was a fairly safe place to be during this

A time period," he said.

On April 2, 1956, Koehler, a recent
high-school graduate, traveled to America
for the ﬁrst time. Koehler's father was
working in Washington, D.C., and sug-
gested ﬂiat Koehler visit his family in the
States.

. "I arrived in New York by boat, and
the ﬁrst thing my parents did was take me
to the top of the Empire State Building. I
was amazed with this booming town. I
saw all the cars, the faces, the glitz of
New York. ‘

"We then went to the Cherry
Blossom Parade in Washington D.C. I
never saw anything like that," Koehler
recalled with a slight smile.

Koehler planned to stay in the United
States long enough to satisfy his parents‘
wishes and work for the U.S. Forest
Service. By 1976, he was a U.S._ citizen)

In the meantime, Koehler enrolled at
George Washington University in the fall
of 1956. He later transferred to Harvard to
ﬁnish his bachelors degree in physics.

He received a master's degree in
physics from George Washington
University in 1963, and in 1967 he
received a doctorate_from the University
of Rochester.

In 1967, Koehler married Anne
Alexander, a former nurse. They have
two sons, Michael, who is a doctoral can-
didate at Stanford University, and
Richard, a third- year Pitt medical stu-
dent.

Koehler said that his work is time-
consuming and doesn't allow him to do
some of the things he'd like to do, such as
go to the theater. One thing he hopes to do
is go to a hockey game.

"There's a lot in this city I haven't
tried yet. I hope I can get around to those

things once my time as dean is over," he _

said, lounging back in his chair with his
hands folded behind his head. "I'd espe-
cially like to make it to a Penguins game
sometime."

Groceria Merante brings a piece of Italy to Oakland 

Corrine LaFata

For The Pltt News

Some grocery markets or
restaurants may claim to be
Italian because of a name like
Rosalini’s or a red, white and
green store sign. But one South
Oakland grocery store seems to
have been lifted right out of the
old country.

The Groceria Merante is a
deli stuffed with Italian meats
and cheeses. It has a wall domi-
nated by an array of pastas and
sauces, a cooler loaded with
Italian cheeses and salads and
three sisters brimming with
Italian spirit.

Gina, Julie and Filomena
"Fil" Merante own and run the
Italian-style grocery store on
Bates and McKee Streets. And
these sisters are about as Italian
as you get.

The sisters come from a
large family of seven children
headed by an Italian—immigrant
father and a first generation
Italian-American mother. Neither
parent ever surrendered their ties
to Italy, and certainly not their
ties to Italian food.

Gina, 31, remembers when
she was a waitress in high school

and _ someone asked her for
“brown toast.”

“I said, ‘All toast is brown,
what do you mean?’ I was 18
years old and I didn’t know there
was any bread but American and
Italian. And American meant
sliced Italian brea .”

Gina added, “I didn’t know
there was such a thing as wheat
brea .”

Now, as the part—owner of a
small grocery, she even sells a
few loaves of wheat bread.
Mostly, however, the store sells
Italian bread, which goes with the
homemade sauce their mother
cooks up and the sausage that
their Uncle Salvatore makes for
the store.

The Merante family is very
close—knit and tries to maintain its
traditions.

_ “Right now it’swine season,
so we’re all making wine,” said
Julie, 33. “It’s a fun tradition to
keep.”

Also, the family still cans
tomatoes and fruit.

“It’s sad that a lot of our gen-
eration doesn’t do it anymore,”
observed Gina.

Every Sunday, the entire
family treks to Mama Merante’s
house for Sunday dinner. This

usually means about 22 place set-
tings. It’s a chance for the family
to catch up on the week’s hap-
penings and to talk to the rela-
tives still in Italy.

Italo Merante, their father,
spoke to his children primarily in
Italian, so all of the children
speak that language ﬂuently.

“Every Sunday, they call us
or we call them,” said Gina,
referring to their relatives who
live in Calabria, Italy.

Also, the three sisters visit
Italy as often as possible. Gina is
probably the family's most regu-
lar traveler. She tries to make the
trek to Calabria, what she calls
the “Florida part of Italy,” every
year.

Being a regular visitor to
Italy, Gina is able to give direc-
tions to popular sights to a cus-
tomer who will vacation there
soon. Gina rattled off her direc-
tions as if she traveled Italy's
roads daily.

The sisters are willing to
help customers however they
can, which usually means
explaining the store's unusual
types produce.

Several customers pointed to
the odd-looking fruit sitting next

Fil, 37, said that it was fruit from the
prickly pear cactus, and then ‘she
explained how to eat it. ‘“I‘hey’re kind of

' e pomegranates, lots of seeds,” noted
Fil. I

     

THE PITT NEWS

Although all three sisters are cus-
tomer-oriented and friendly, Gina and
Julie like to run the register, while Fil
favors running the deli's slicer.

The sisters have assumed niini-roles
in the store. Fil is the “queen slicer," Julie.
is the “sign maker”, and Gina is the self-
proclaimed “gofei” —— she’l1 do an , ‘Kg.

This categorization of positio may
be hereditary. '

“My dad decided each of us was good
for one job and put us there,” explained
Gina. “He started us all out.”

“Lucky for him, we all liked it,”
added Julie, 33.

Each of the seven Merante brood is
self-employed, with Gina, Julie and Fil
running the family business.

In 1951, their father, Italo, and their
Uncle Salvatore opened a grocery on
Frazier Street, which they operated until
they relocated to Marion Street in 1961. In
1979, they opened their second store, on
Bates and McKee Streets.

. Switzerland has approved a government program to dis- ,

pense heroin to addicts. That country, which has one of the

Pmgmm ’ .

Monika Stocker, head of welfare services in Zurich, and
Ethan Nadelmman, director of a New York-based drug-pol-
icy research institute, hope that the example will encourage
other cotmtries, including the United States, to enact similar
policies.

We hope that doesn’t happen yet.

It’s too early totell whether such a program will help

'matters,orifitwillmakethingsworse.Therearestilltoo

many questions to be answered
Itisquitepossiblethatsuchprogramswillmakeheroin
more easily available on the street. It may give reason for
nonaddicts to increase their usage, knowing that if they
become addicts, the drug will be rmde freely available for
them. The_program may even take the place of abstinence

_ preaching and so-called family values.

Now, we are not condemning the program Advocates

A contend that it will result in lower death rates among users,

fewer drug-related crimes and improvements in the overall
health of that nation. They may be right. But the score isn’t
in yet, and we have noway of knowing what will happen.

This could end up being very good For instance,
Switzerland has paved the way with clean-needle exchange
programs. They provide clean needles for drug users, so that
they don’t have to share, all in an effort to thwart the spread
of AIDS and HIV through needle sharing. This is a good
idea Some ask why we should spend tax money keeping
alive a little longer addicts who will probably end up dying
from their drugs anyway. But keeping HIV from spreading
among users also keeps it from spreading among everybody
with whom users have sex. It isn’t wrong to attempt to keep
these innocents ﬁom being infected. .

But taking the leap to doling out free heroin for addicts
would be too hasty right now. We must wait and see what
happens in Switzerland; let’s see if things really do improve.
If so, then we may want to consider such programs here.

In the meantime, we’ne skeptical. We can’t aﬂbnd to take

Germs: They can happen to you

Alison Novicki
columnist

I witnessed something terribly
disgusting at Eat’n Park the other
night that makes me wonder about
how rampant germs really are.

My friend and I had just sat
down in a booth next to the area
where they make desserts and till
drink orders, and I was watching
our soon-to-be waitress put togeth-
er a “tin-roof sundae.” I watched
the sundae cup with great pleasure

-as it ﬁlled up with vanilla ice

cream, peanuts, chocolate and
whipped cream.

Then, I watched with horror as
the waitress scooped up some
whipped cream that had fallen onto
the tray back into the cup with her
bare hands!

As if it was not horrible
enough to see her touching the
food of a patron, she proceeded to
lick the left‘-over whipped cream
from her ﬁngers.

Needless to say, we left.

Since this experience, I have
been plagued with constant
thoughts of the exponential spread
of germs. And, unfortunately, this
is not something that can be con-
trolled.

For example, in the worst—case
scenario, the Eat’n Park waitress
might have gone to the bathroom
and not washed her hands after-
ward. The result would be that the
poor soul at Eat’n Park who
ordered the tin-roof sundae got a
mouthful‘ of something she obvi-
ously didn’t order with the sundae.
(Yes, this is blatantly disgusting,
but it probably happens more than
we care to think about.)

Let’s say that the waitress went
to the bathroom and did wash her

hands when she was ﬁnished. She
still has to open the door to get out
of the bathroom by using the han-
dle that other people have touched.
Hence, the poor soul who ordered
the sundae still got a mouthful of
something else.

Now, let’s pretend that the
waitress had just washed her hands
at a sink next to the counter. She
still has to touch the scooper for the
ice cream, the spoon for the
peanuts, the pump for the chocolate
and the canister for the whipped
cream. Who knows who touched
those things before she did? Who
knows what they. touched before
they touched those things?‘ In this
case, the poor soul who ordered the
sundae could end up with a mouth-
ful of germs from several people.

What if the waitress didn’t use
her hand to scoop up the whipped
cream, and she used a spoon
instead? The whipped cream still
would have touched the waitress’_s
tray, which is full of dirt and germs
from dirtieddishes and table rags.

I suppose it would be simplest
to rag on the waitress for having
touched the whipped cream in the
ﬁrst place, but there_are so many
other people involved that it
wouldn’t even matter if she did or
did not touch the whipped cream.

What about the dishwashers?
Technically, they are in charge of
removing the dirt and germs of the
last patron who ate from the (sundae
cup. (Like a “germ middleman”)
Let’s assume that the dishwasher
decides to be lazy, only rinses the
sundae cup, then returns it to the
clean-dish bin. From there, the sun-
dae cup moves from the hands of
the person who handles dishes to
the hands of the -waitress. _

At this point, the sundae cup

THE PITT NEWS

has collected germs from a fellow
patron, from the busperson who
cleared the table, from the lazy
dishwasher, from any other persons
in the kitchen who handles dishes
and from the waitress. Also, the
sundae cup has been passed along
to the poor soul who ordered the
sundae. ' I

That poor soul.

I am aware that Eat’n Park is
not exactly a ﬁve-star establish-
ment that takes great caution in
preparing and delivering food, but
the. experience I had there has
jump-started my oppressed para-
noia of gemis, which originated
about ﬁve years ago when I got a
rare virus that the doctors believed
to be Coxsackie virus. (Yes, it is all
one word.) - '

“ The virus only gives you a rash
on your hands, feet and sometimes
in your throat, and goes away all by
itself. It’s not life-threatening or
serious, but it is very rare. It’s so
rare that it took several doctors to
ﬁgure out what it was; and when
they finally came to a consensus,
only one of the doctors had ever
seen another case.

The thing that scared me was

that I got this virus by touching
something that had Coxsackie
virus germs. _

That “something” I touched
could have been anything, accord-
ing to what the doctors told me.

That “something” I touched
could have been the sundae cup
from which I ate my own tin-roof
sundae ﬁve years ago at Eat’n
Park.

Pride and a good attitude can make up for anything

Jennifer

Stoltz

I can recall sitting in the
Cathedral during the ﬁrst week of
classes, surrounded by people I
didn’t know. The TA in the ﬁont of
the room was being congenial,
asking us what we had been doing
during orientation. Later, she
inquired as to whether we would
be attending the ﬁrst football game
of the year. After most of us had
nodded “yes,” she replied, “Oh,
you’ll have a good time, but you’ll
get sick of it when they never win
a game.”

Well, I was totally shocked by
her comment. Being a cheerleader
in high school, I was ofthe under-
standing that even if one of yoru
school’s teams had a habit of los-
ing, you never said it out loud It
was unpatriotic, or something like
that. But, before her statement
could even register in my mind,
another student —— a member of
the football team -— spoke up and
said something. Needless to say,
the TA must be eating her words
right now. '

This stellar attitude came full
circle with this year’s second home
game. Having never been to a Pitt
football game, I had no idea what
to expect I was used to large
crowds, since our high school
attracted fans from all over the
community. However, getting
some of them to cheer during the
game was like pulling teeth with-
out anesthetic. I remember in
juniorhighwhenthe l0orsofans
at a game would yell, “Get out of
my way, I want to see my kid!” at
anyone who walked in their path.
Such is not even close to being the
case here.

The. atmosphere was awe-
some. Fans screaming in an overall
extremely spirited crowd, hand-
made signs, Tony the Tiger-tum -
Panther fan bobbing through the
crowd The attitude was conta-
gious. I don’t think one person left
that stadium with his voice fully

' intact You could barely hear your-

self over the band, complete with
the fans’ additions to the ﬁght song.

Voices were projected across
the ﬁeld, even if the ESPN cam-
eras were nowhere near them. And

after the game, the
outpouring of fans
onto the ﬁeld needs
no description —
probably because
most of us were
there to see the goal-
post ripping, if not
directly involved in
it. You could feel the
energy and excite-
ment behind both

person, or group of
people to band
together, and make
the once “impossi-
ble” possible. Even
if they still do not
achieve their goal,
they left the battle
honorably.

Maybe Pitt foot-
ball is in its rebuild-
ing stage. All teams
endure that periodi-

players, and that
mattered more than any ranking or
prediction of success or failure.

A team can have an undefeat-
edrecordandnotbeatrue winner.
It’s the attitude behind that record
that counts. Pitt was given a death
sentence, so to speak, in the predic-
tions for this season, and look
where the Panthers are. This does-
n’t just apply to football; it’s just
the most immediate example.

Anyone can be told they can’t
do something, or that the odds are
stacked grossly against them. The
easiest thing to do would be to live
up to that low standard, whether or

notonpmposelttakesagreater

cally. But there is a
large difference between rebuild-
ing “superstars” and rebuilding a
team Scouts can bring all the All-
Americans and MVPs in the
nationhere,butitwillrneannoth-
ing unless there is teamwork, atti-
tude and work ethic. In any case,
sports or not, one-track minds only
focused on winning are bad There
are other building blocks, like
development, that not only matter
much more, but should be the pri-
mary focus.

I received an email from a
ﬁiend at Penn State. She wrote,
“Wow! How did your football
team do it? Everybody said you

guys had nothing this year guess
they were wrong!” Well, yes, they
were wrong. We have attitude. I
can’t emphasize this enough:
“Everybody” can be wrong, and
most of the time, they are. It takes
something higher to prove it to
them, and right now, I think we
have that.

No matter what happens the
rest of the season, even if we don’t
see another victory, we will
emerge victorious. I hope we do
show the rest of them who’s No. 1,
with our record speaking for us.
But, if we don’t, the football team’s
“new attitude” will not be forgot-
ten. We have taught our critics a
valuable lesson. “Expect the
Unexpec ” — that was our
senior slogan at my high school.
Now, it applies to the present, and
weneedtoapplyittothefuture.
So, take a cue ﬁorn the Miami
game. Never let anyone tell you
something is impossible.

night while listening to fellow, stu-
dents’cheers in the Schenley Quad

The Homecoming race for king and

Spending such an outrageous amount

shallowness of the candidates. Why
don’t they just throw their money out

with pretty faces that will just be

Once again, you have gone above
and beyond the call of duty in represent-
ing the opinion of the student body. Your
Sept. 17 editorial hit the nail right on the
head. Screw class, it’s Homecoming
Week and its time to party. I mean, who is
here to learn anyway? The purpose of
going to college is to spend a lot of
money simply so one can party. Besides,
think of the memories one will have in
four years, or four and a half, or ﬁve, of
the fun you had at Pitt, if you can remem-
ber the fun through the haze of the alco-
hol.

-And besides, what good will a QPA,

and university affiliation (if any).

 

or an internship, or a B.S. or B.A. do you
when you graduate? Aside from the obvi-
ous job or grad-school plans, nothing.
Well, nothing compared to the memories
of the fun that Pitt is, or was.

So, the hell with the professors that
are trying to give you that useless college
degree, it’s just college. Skip class, get
drunk, go to football games. But, after it’s
over, don’t go around crying to your
friends about how Pitt failed to give you
the experience or qualiﬁcations to land
that dream job. Instead, when you are
counting your tips at the end of the night,
you can always look back on how much
fun Homecoming was, and blame your
useless degree on, to quote The Pitt News,
the “many self-important professors who
consider it a personal insult when you’re
not in their class.”

I enjoyed most of Michael Berquist’s
Sept. 22 column about why the Democratic

But in his characterization of the
American public as consisting of liberals,
moderates, and conservatives, he leaves out
the roughly 25 percent of Americans who
are socially liberal and economically conser-

Indeed, he mentioned that former

booed off the podium of the 1992
Republican National Convention for his
belief that “the government should stay out

Last week, the Pittsburgh Panthers
scored an unforgettable victory over the
21st-ranked football team in the country,
the Miami Hurricanes. ’

Last year, the Panthers barely defeat-
ed the Temple Owls, who lost every game
but one that season.

This Saturday, Oct. 4, Pitt faces
Temple once again. On Monday, days
before the Homecoming rematch from a
year ago and over a week since Pitt’s last
game, Head Coach Walt Harris used his
weekly press conference to explain how
this season’s squad hopes to avoid anoth-
er one-point nail-biter versus the Owls. ,

“We’ve had a week of summer camp,
quite honestly,” said Harris, who turned
his team over to strength and conditioning
coach Buddy Morris for much of the pre-
vious week “We have a lot of respect for
Temple”

The Owls, it seems, retum the favor.

Temple Head Coach Ron Dickerson,
whose voice was pumpedinto the confer-
ence room through the Big East telecon-
ference system, said that “Pitt’s urgency is
truly impressive  you can tell that these
kids want it. They have some big, talented
players on their team.”

Dickerson also commented on Pitt’s
passing game, saying that the Panther

squad was much more dangerous in the
short-pass department this season than last
season.

Fifth-year senior quarterback Pete

Gonzalez has been the key to Pitt’s effec— e

tiveness in passing. He has completed 58
of 112 passes for a total of 667 yards, nine
touchdowns and only two interceptions.
Despite the numbers and big expecta-
tions, Harris wants to keep his players’
helmets “the same size” — preventing

It was an ordinary cross-country

A meet on an ordinary Saturday after-

noon at the Penn State Spiked-Shoe
Invitational.

No Pitt-PSU rivalry talk, no
injuries like at the meet at West
Virginia — only the Panther runners
attempting to showcase their talents in
their biggest meet to date.

For the most part, the Pitt men’s,
and women’s cross country teams
turned in very ordinary performances.
The women ﬁnished third in the nine-
team field with 127 points, and the
men placed ninth of 13 teams with 262
points. -

While this is an improvement over
the squad’s injury-plagued, last-place
efforts in its previous meet at West
Virginia, these results mirror the
team’s performances earlier this year
and efforts from last season.

The women were led by seniors

Amy Francy, who was 25th in 19:29,
and Lynda Andros, who placed 30th in
19:40. Those two have been leading

the team all season, but the gap got a

little bit smaller this time. Lauren Fittz
was right on Andros’ heels, ﬁnishing
33rd in 19:48. .

“Lauren ran tough. For her to be
that close, she ran very well,” said Pitt
Head Coach Dave Sobal. “I expected
Amy and Lynda to be out there a little
bit farther, but Lauren stuck close.”

The early part of the season
includes a lot of heavy training in
addition to races. Fatigue from tough
practices may have been a factor in the
top runners’, performances, according
to Sobal. ’

“[Francy and Andros] looked a lit-
tle tired. There was a lack of leg
turnover. That’s something we need to
work on,” he explained.

Penn State and Bucknell battled it
out-at the top, finishing first and sec-
ond with 22 and 45 points, respective-

ly. Pitt came out on top of a tight pack
to take third place, with only 22 points
separating Pitt, St. Francis, the State
University of New York at Albany, and
Clarion.

“All of the women factored into
that. When it’s that close, every single
place down the line is important,”
Sobal said.

The biggest plus on the men’s side
was that the freshmen got a taste of
what it’s like to compete in a big race.
Three of Pitt’s top five runners were
freshmen, led once again by Mike
Orzechowski. Orzechowski came in
48th place, running the 5.2 mile course
in 27:48.

Another freshman, Max Itkin, was i

Pitt’s second runner, in 67th place with
a time of 28:23. The third freshman,
John Becker, finished 94th in 29:10.
The two upperclassmen in Pitt’s
top five did not have good days.

Playoff preview part I: Can the
Indians derail the Yankee dynasty?

Matt Mento

 

Staff Wrlter

The Yankees are back to defend their
crown, but they face a much more diffr-
cult road this time as they draw the
Central Division Champion Cleveland
Indians in the first round.

This wild-card game, featuring the
defending World Series champions and
the former hosts of the Albert Belle media
circus, kicks off tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
New York. Orel Hershiser is scheduled
to throw for the Tribe. Hershiser went 14-
6 during the regular season with a 4.47
ERA.

The Yanks have David Cone sched-
uled for the opener and are hoping he will
recreate his past success as a postseason

hired gun. Cone had a 12-6 record with a ’

2.82 ERA during the season.

The Yankees have the pitching
advantage if Cone can stay healthy for the
playoffs. They have a deep staff that
includes Andy Petite (18—7, 2.88 ERA)
and David Wells (16-10, 4.21 ERA).
They are also strong in the bullpen with
Mariano Rivera, who had 43 saves dur-
ing the regular season. The Yanks should
also have Dwight Gooden healthy for the
playoffs. He most likely will be a middle
reliever during the series.

The Indians are not as strong, but

they do have some prominent starters —,

most notably Charles Nagy, who went

15-10 with a 4.21 ERA this season. They
also have a strong bullpen, which boasts
ﬁreballer Jose Mesa and Mike Jackson,
who had 16 and 15 saves this year,
respectively.

New York has a strong offensive line-
up, with center ﬁelder Bernie Williams,
who hit .325 during the regular season,
and Tina Martinez, who had 44 home
runs and 141 RBI.

The Tribe counterattacks with a sim-
ilar mix of power- and singles-hitters. It
features playoff veteran David Justice,
who hit .331 with 33 homers and 101
RBI. Other standouts for the Tribe
include Manny Ramirez, who hit .330,
and catcher Sandy Alomar, who hit .324
during the regular season. ‘

The Indians have a power advantage
over the Yanks in that they belted 220
home runs this season — far more than
New York could muster. This production
was enough to set a new club record,
beating‘ last year’s mark of 218 home
I'l1l‘lS. '

The Yankees ﬁnished the regular sea-
son on a high note, winning ﬁve in a row,
and ended the season with 96 wins. It was
the first time they’d reached that total

1 since 1985.

The series will come down to pitch-
ing, and the Yanks have a stronger staff
than the Tribe’s. But if Cleveland’s bats
get hot, than New York will struggle.

This season, Oakland wasn’t in a simi-

I’m sure the Athletics’ managenrent
considered the third option, but ait’s irnprac-
tical, unless your star player is Bugs Bunny.

Rooting McGwire on to glory, in
effect, means rooting to enshrine the current
ﬁnancial setup of major-league baseball -—
which is something that no one in his right
mind should support —

sense — hope Maris holds the mark forev-
er. He earned it

Yankee Stadium as well as on the road -
people were on my back The last six years
in the American League were mental hell
for me. I was drained of all my desire to play
baseball. ” — Roger Maris

Maris overcame America’s greatest
sports legend in Ruth. McGwire, Gritfey
and the rest are just pursuing a number.
Sixty-one may be our only collective mem-
ory of a man haunted by the Babe, over-
shadowed by Mickey Mantle and worthy of
our continuing admiration. Let it stand.

Once again, the juggemaut Atlanta

1 Braves made their way to the playoffs.

They face off against the Astros in what
could be the most mismatched series of the

four ﬁrst-round contests.

The Astros face an all-star lineup in
Atlanta, which has made six straight play-
off appearances and has been to the World
Series in four out of the last ﬁve seasons.
The Astros haven’t been to the playoffs
since 1986, when the New York 'Mets
defeated them for the pennant. The Braves
were defeated by the New York Yankees
last season for the World Series title.

The series begins today in Atlanta’ at

1:00 p.m., with Darryl Kile pitching for"

Houston and Greg Maddux throwing for
the Braves. Kile went 19-7 during the reg-
ular season with a 2.57 ERA. Maddux was
19-4 with a 2.20 ERA. .

The Braves have the edge with a pitch-
ing staif that includes Denny Neagle (20-4,

2.84 ERA during the regular season) and
Tom Glavine (14-7, 2.96 ERA). They also
have a strong closer in Mark Wohlers,
who led the team with 33 saves. If needed,
the Braves will use other starters as middle
relief. .

Houston is not as strong on the mound,
but it does have Mike Hampton, who went
15-10 with a 3.83 ERA, and‘ Shane
Reynolds, who had a 9-10 record with a
4.23 ERA.

The Astros hold the advantage in
closers and middle-relief pitchers. Young
middle-reliever John Hudek had four
saves during the Astros" regular season,

which complemented his middle-inning‘

work The Astros also feature a young clos-
er, Billy .Wagner, who had 23 saves and a

2.85 ERA during the regular season.
Olfensively, the Astros may have a
slight advantage as well. Second baseman
Craig Biggio hit .309 during the regular
season with 22 home runs and 81 RBI. The
Astros also have third baseman Jeﬂ'
Bagwell who hit .287 with 43 homers and
135 RBI to complete the “Killer B” combo.
The Braves’ offense features speedy
center ﬁelder Kenny Lofton, who hit .333

, with 27 stolen bases. Chipper Jones and

Fred McGriﬁ‘ make up the heart of the
order, providing power and rum production.

Overall, Atlanta should win — the
Astros struggled to stay above .500 all sea-
son. Pitching will prevail, and the Braves
should dominate if they can avoid going to
their bullpen early.

The bottomlineisthatAtlantahas
experience; the majority of its lineup has
been here before. This alone may carry
Atlanta to another World Series matchup.

HARRIS

_ the conference to discuss his personal phi-

losophy.

Harris’ motto is, “You play like you
live” -— a quote from his mentor and for-
mer coach, Buddy Ryan.

Hanis explained, “If you live tough,
you play tough. That’s what I have grown
up to believe.”

The summer-camp-like practices have
helped make the team play tough, accord-
ing to the coach. They have worked espe-
cially well with the freshmen and transfers
— players who may not even have seen
last season’s Homecoming heroics.

.“We have some very young players
and we have worked them very, very
hard,” said Hanis. “We lmve a challenge
ahead of us. Temple has been in every

game this season. It’s not going to be easy.”-

Harris also commented on the
defense’s continued success in forcing

fumbles and interceptions. He said that .

Pitt’s MadDog  “has leamedthe ftm-

damentals and techniques in gaining

turnovers —- Temple has been unlucky in
this area.”

Senior John Jenkins has proved this.
His Homecoming interception with under
1:30 left versus Miami will go into Pitt’s
record book Also, during the ﬁrst quarter
of the game against Houston, Jenkins

Harris also did some narne-dropping

The San Francisco Giants, fresh
from clinching their first National
League West title in eight years, face
the Florida Marlins, who have kicked
back and enjoyed for a few days now
their first-ever playoff berth.

The Marlins finished eighth in
team batting (.259), fourth in team
pitching (3.76 ERA) and second in
the NL East with a 92-70 record,
while the Giants, armed with one of
the best bullpens in the National
League, finished with a 90-72 record.

But who cares now? All those
statistics will be meaningless once
San Francisco’s Kirk Rueter throws
his first pitch tonight to kick off the
1997 National League Divisional
Wild Card Series.

Rueter and company will take on
Florida’s bats. Moises Alou came
from Montreal and finished the sea-
son as one of Florida’s top home-run
hitters with 23 dingers. Gary
Sheffield finished behind Alou with
21 ‘and is another one of Florida’s
sluggers.

First baseman Jeff Conine gives
the offense depth, but the Marlins’
secret weapon may be late-season
acquisition Darren Daulton, who
despite his bad knees remains a
home-run threat.

THE PITT NEWS .

Florida’s pitching staff is its
other strong“ suit. Cy Young Award
candidate Kevin Brown leads the
starting rotation and will make
Tuesday’s start for the Marlins.
Brown is followed by Al Leiter on
Wednesday and Rookie of the Year
candidate Livan Hernandez on
Friday.

The bullpen is Robb Nen and his
35 saves. The Marlins’ overworked
bullpen may hinder them if the
starters falter, but Tony Saunders’
move to relief adds strength to the
bullpen. 9 -

For the ‘Giants, center fielder
Barry Bonds brilliantly displayed
his “kwan,” a la Cuba Gooding, Jr.,
in Jerry Maguire, after the Giants

   
  
    
    

clinched the NL West. Bonds’ biggest
test now is to prove that he can per-
form in the postseason.

Like Florida, the Giants are
stockpiled with hitters. Slick center
fielder Stan Javier batted .286, and
infielders Jeff Kent and J.T. Snow
both passed the 100-RBI mark (121
and 104, respectively).

San‘ Francisco’s strongest point is
probably its bullpen. Ace closer Rod
Beck finished the season with 37
saves, third in the National League,
and the late—season acquisition of
Danny Darwin helps the Giants at
middle relief. ,

But San Francisco will have to
rely on its starters if it wants the
closers to do their job. Staff ace Sean

« Playoff preview III: Barry Bonds vs. Bobby Bonilla  who do we cheer?

Estes went 19-5 with a 3.18 ERA and
has a formidable supporting cast of
Rueter, former Marlin Pat Rapp and
Wilson Alvarez to accompany his
fastball.

But forget pitching,'hitting and
coaching ‘strategies for just a
moment. Think about the one psy-
chological aspect of the game that
stands out the most: Whom will jet
lag catch up to first? Both teams have
an equal amount of travel time, so it
might not matter.

Mental preparation is still the
key, however. Jim Leyland has been
priming this club for the postseason
since his arrival in Miami.
Prediction: Florida in five, but Dusty
Baker’s Giants will fight to the end.

Playoff Preview IV: Will Baltimore's playoff woes continue?

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The Baltimore Orioles and Seattle
Mariners face oﬁ Wednesday to begin the
American League Divisional Playolf Series.

The Orioles have some unﬁnished busi-
ness from last year. They were eliminated
from the playoﬁs on a missed fan-interfer-
ence call -— everyone remembers Jeﬂiey
Maier, right? This call left the O’s without a
World Series opportunity, but it did get one
junior-high student the souvenir of a lifetime-

TheMariners,ontheotherhand,areone'

of baseball’s younger teams and always seem
to be in the postseason hunt Game one starts
at 8:00 pm. Wednesday on NBC.

The first game pits pitcher Randy
Johnson against Mike Mumina.

Johnson is the most dominating pitcher
inthegametoday.Hehasascaryfastballthat
always reaches into the high 90s. If he is _on
with his slider, he is virtually unhittable.
Johnson needs to win game one to give the
Mariners a chance to take the best-of-ﬁve
series.

The rest of Seatt1e’s statf is a little weak
Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer are both
ﬁnesse pitchers. They can get the job done,
but are not as consistent and do not have a
great deal of postseason experience.

Mussim opens the series for theAL East

Champions. He has a good fastball that

ranges fnom91 to93 mph Healsohasalot
of breaking pitches, all of which are consis-
tently effective. \lV1th up to" six diﬂ"erent pitch-
es, he usually has batters guessing. 5

Baltimore’s No. 2, Jimmy Key, has
proved that he is a big—game pitcher. The
Orioles saw this in last year’s playoffs when
Key was a member of the World Champion
New York Yankees. They liked him so much
they signed him as a free agent.

The Orioles’ bullpen outpaces the
Mariners by far. The Mariners feature
Heathclilf Slocumb as their closer. He has a
good fastball and an above—average splitter.

K" Unfortunately, Slocumb is a very streaky

pitcher.

Norm Charlton and Bobby Ayala are
tlrecoreoftlreSeattlepen,buttlrey tendto
have a problem throwing strikes. In short, the
Mariners need strong starts to stay competi-
tive. ‘

The Orioles have a deep, versatile and
veteran bullpen. Alan Mills throws about 95
mph, whi1eJesseOroscohasgreatbreaking
stuff. Armando Benitez is one of the hardest-
throwing guys in ﬂre majors, while Terry
Matthews consistently baﬂles hitters with
oﬂ’-speed magic.

These four guys set the table for Randy
Myers, who closes the door. He uses the fast-
ball to get out of jams, but has much better
control than he did in his “Nasty Boy” days
with the Reds.

In the ﬁeld, the Orioles have the advan-
tage at the comers. Cal Ripken, Jr. and
Rafael Palmiero anchor Baltimore’s stellar
inﬁeld. Ripken will catch anything that comes
his way and will hit in big situations.

Up the middle, Roberto Alomar is a
great defensive second baseman. He makes
the routine plays and the spectacular ones.
Alomar also hits consistently for average.
Mike Bordick was so good at short that he
bumped Ripken to third this year. He is as
steady as they come.

The Mariners have Paul Sorrento, Joey
Cora, Alex Rodriguez and Brent Gates

manning the inﬁeld Rodriguez is anAll-Star 1'

and a great—hitting shortstop. He will give the
Orioles problems. '
The outﬁeld has to go to the Mariners.
Anyone who has Ken Griﬁey, Jr. out there
has to get the nod. He hit 56 home runs this
year and wins the Gold Glove every year.
Mix him with the power hitting of Jay
Buhner and Roberto Kelly and you may
have the most imposing outﬁeld in the
majors. —
5 The Orioles have Jeffrey Hammonds,
B.J., Surhoﬁ‘ and Brady Anderson. They are
all steady outﬁelders and will hold their own.
The Orioles should win this series on the
strength of their pitchers, especially the
bullpen. Griﬂey can rrrake a big ditference,
but he still needs a lot of help ﬁom his team-
mates.

battling illness and injuries all sea-
son, placed 28nd in 28:51.
Sophomore Matt Hornsby was
86th in 28:59. That’s about 15 sec-
onds faster than he was on the
same course last fall, but Sobal was
disappointed.

“My expectation is that you
improve more than that from year
to year,” he said.

FROM PAGE 8

The men apparently have 8

improved during the course of the
season. In their first meet this sea-
son, Pitt’s men ﬁnished 31 points
behind Duquesne. Last Saturday,
the Panthers were 35 points behind

Duquesne, but in a much larger J

meet, where teams are generally
more spread out. Both the men and
the women still have work to do,
though, according to Sobal.

This was Pitt’s biggest meet of
the season so far in terms of sheer
numbers. There were nearly 100
women and almost 150 men racing
Saturday. Next weekend at Lehigh,

those numbers should swell to well

over 200 for each category.

“You need to get out fast in a
big race,” Sobal said. “I think we
got out okay [at Penn State]; now
it’s a matter of maintaining that
through the whole race.”
