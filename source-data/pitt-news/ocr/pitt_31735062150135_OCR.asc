Q _ O
Brlngs to Mind
HE recognition given today to students who
have taken outstanding parts in extra-cur-
ricular activities brings up a question of import-
ance to many students~—the need for making a sat-
isfactory adjustment between scholarship and ac-
tivities.

It has been claimed by some observers of Uni-
versity life that activities are not worth while
because they divert the attention of students from
their academic work. Those who hold this view-
point maintain that activities are only a super-

ﬂuous addition to the main purpose of a university,
the pursuit of learning.

Example of what too much emphasis on activ-
ities can do to students is the case of the typical
Joe College who is so busy With his fraternity,
dance committee, and the glee club that only o_c-
casionally can he ﬁnd time to cut an activity in
favor of classes.

The University may have a few Joe Colleges, but
it is more noted for its large number of “street-
car” students, who stay on campus only long
enough to go t'o classes. They are learning facts,
accumulating enough knowledge of their subjects
to pass examinations. But in not gaining experi-
ence in planning projects and working with others,
they are missing some of the best opportunities
which University life aﬁords. A

No amount of cla.ssroom work can provide the
experiences which are available through activities
in business and management, creative self-expres-
sion, proﬁtable use of leisure time, and develop-
ment of personality and leadership.

That this experience can be gained Without im-
pairing scholastic work is indicated by the results
of a study conducted by Dr. Vincent WV. Lanfear,
dean of men, who concluded that “Those who gain
positions of responsibility in activities are usually
well above the average scholastically.”

During the school. year 1937-38, Dr. Lanfear
found that iiien students were most active in cam-
pus affairs at the University, niaiiitaiiicd a quality
point average of 1.8. while the all-in_on’s :::vci.":-‘i for
the saiiic period was only  Iiicliidctl in the

THE PITT NEWS

A Champion  
Of Democracy Speaks

F IT WERE announced a year ago today that

Eduard Benes would speak at the University,
most of the campus would have passed off the no-
‘tice with a polite yawn.

In the space of a few months, however, the name
Benes has become world famous, has developed
into something much more than the name of cen-
tral European statesman. Dr. Benes, now lectur-
ing at the University of Chicago, has, by his heroic
stand throughout the dismemberiiient of Czecho-
slovakia, his championship of a real democracy,
become known the world over.

So the fact that he Will speak in Stephen Foster
Memorial tomorrow morning and in Syria Mosque
tonight takes on great signiﬁcance. It is, in the
ﬁrst place, a welcome change from the usual parade
of arctic explorers, anthropologists, sportswriters,
etc., who usually monopolize University platforms.

Secondly, the appearances of Benes will be im-
portant from the standpoint of the present crisis in

world affairs, Will offer an opportunity for students
to hear one who himself was caught in the mael-
stroni of current history.

Vile hope the students and faculty will take ad-
vantage of this chance to hear the ex-president. of
one of the few republics which actually functioned
in efficient style.

Dr. Benes will discuss the matter of “democ-
racy.” He is an expert on the subject.

Pitt Players

‘Our Town’ Show
By William Murray

Pitt Players closed one of the most
successful seasons they have had for
some time, with a sincere and
tlioughtful presentation of Thornton
Wilder’s “Our Town” Tuesday and
Wednesday night.

The success of the play was due
largely to careful direction by Buell
Whitehill and his assistant, Bernard
Mayer. The actual presentation de-
pended almost entirely on the pacing
kept by the Stage Manager, played
by Earl Riley. He kept the play
moving with commendable ease.

PLAY IS UNIQUE

The play itself is unique, being
presented without scenery and with
few props. About 20 chairs, 2 step-
ladders, and a plank are the only
props used. Effective lighting and
convincing sound effects gave the
presentation a professional ﬁnish.

Casting of major characters was
surprisingly good, with one or two
exceptions. One of the most ﬂagrant
charges made against The Players is
that they do not have enough material
at Pitt to produce a good play. “Our
Town” proves otherwise.
PEGGY MEGEE STARS

Peggy Megee was excellent as

Emily. She was at all times absorbed
in her portrayal, and gave a touching
performance. Joe Burkley did ex-
ceptionally well as George.

Alice Jahn and -Georgetta Davis
were wisely cast in the role of Mrs.
Gibbs and Mrs. Webb, and the other
characters were well chosen, espe-
cially Richard Milo, Edna Kauffman,
and James McHale. Milo, perhaps
more than anyone else in the cast,
with the exception of Miss Megee,
realized the potentiality of his role.

Members Check Sheets

All committee chairmen request
that members come into the YWCA
office to check their personnel sheets,
according to Elizabeth Farrow, exec-
utive secretary.

the typical American youth attending
one of the nation’s 1,500 institutions
of higher learning. And it is a well-
founded description, for nearly half
of them are doing just that.

A nation—wide study of economic
conditions of college and university
students has been conducted by the
Student Opinion Surveys of Amer-
ica, the results showing that 47.2 per
cent “work” to pay part or all of
their college expenses.”
PART-TIME JOBS

The student that goes through four
years of classroom and laboratory
routine and as a sideline earns all his
living expenses is not as common as
the one who has a part-time job that
merely supplements his allowance
from home or a scholarship fund.
Nevertheless, the Surveys clearly
point out that almost ﬁve out every
ten students in this country care

Libotit an cclucatiou bc;;7c:.‘;c‘:

Although not as
men hold jobs, over a third report
that they perform some sort of work
to aid their pocketbooks. Slightly
less" than 34 per cent of the co-eds'in—
cluded. in the representative sample
used answered “yes” to the question,
“Do you work to pay all or part of
your college expenses?”

DO MENI.AL WORK

There are collegians who sweep
halls of learning for their spending
money. Others wait on tables or
act as clerks in stores for their meals.
The smarter ones coach and even
write papers for their classmates at
handsome rates.

A Texas undergraduate has devel-
oped a “night mail service.” Along-
side the U. S. mailboxes he has set
up his own. For ﬁve cents he will
get your late letters to the trains at
hours when Uncle Sam’s mailmen are
home asleep. Thousands receive N.
Y. A. aid. Colleges and universities
employ a great many as assistants
and library pages. The variety of

many VVOIIIGII as‘

student occupations is staggering.

Panthers Favored to Trip

Hoosiers

Despite Track Coach’s Blues Singing

By Ben Foote

Although Coach Carl Olson is
singing the blues as is his habit, and

comparative times of Pitt men are,

somewhat inferior to the winning
times of events in Indiana’s dual
meets with Michigan and Ohio State,
the News yogis go out on the well
known limb and forecast -a Panther
victory, Saturday at Bloomington.

One of our arguments for picking
the local outfit is their record feat
in winning four Penn Relays cham-
pionships two weeks ago, a feat that
the News dared to suggest before-
hand. In every one of the four events
that Pitt foursome carried off the
trophies, Indiana teams were en-
tered and finished well behind John-
ny Woodruff and his mates.
SECOND ARGUMENT

Secondly, most of the events on
the program that dual meet com-
parative records should give to In-
diana in tomorrow’s affair, were
events that Panther cindermen had
little or no competition in against
Temple and West Virginia. After
much figuring, head scratching, and
reasoning, we came up with the fol-
lowing prediction: Pitt 75, Indiana 66.

Inasmuch as we proved to be too
conservative in calling the result of
the Temple meet, although we came
within ten points and as we called
our shot in the Penn Relays exactly
right, we don’t see how we can be
far wrong this time. We are all
aware, though, that accidents some-
times happen.

Frank Ohl, the flying junior who
helped make history at Franklin
Field, and Larry Tregoning, blonde
sophomore star, should give the Pan-
thers at least six points in each of
the dashes. -

Although Cochran, Hoosier quar-
ter-miler, toured the quarter mile
route in 48.7 seconds a2.ainst Ohio
State, it IS doubtful. whether he can
fight off the challenge of three Pitt
stars, Ferrara, McKee, and Graf.
This trio has had things easy in
their dual meets to date, and have
not reached Cochran’s figure, but
they are well skilled in the art of
keeping one of their threesome in
front.

WOODRUFF RUNS

In the 880, Captain Johnny Wood-
ruff will be extended to a greater
degree than he has been this season,
but his long ebony legs will carry
him safely across the line in front
of Mel Trutt, Hoosier middle dis-
tance ace. Over the mile route Trutt
will give the Olympic 800 meter
champ much more competition. Del
Anderson, Pitt sophomore who hail:=.
from Laporte, Indiana. is a good'thir.l
place prospect in the half-mile.

Al Boulanger, new Pitt two-mile
record holder, will battle Tolliver of
Indiana for top "r-onors in this long
distance event, and if Al is in top
form, he will win.

may have plenty to say about ﬁve
outcome of the two mile.

week-end play. Reilly, Mcclintock,
Mathias, and Seybold round out the
squad.

Georgetown throws a triumvirate
of veterans into competition, name-
ly, Shea, Dettweider, and Burke.
Princeton offers another threesome
to club the Pittites, Riddle, Clark,
and Page. Penn holds a trump in
Max Moore, last week-end’s best in-
dividual performer.

Last Tuesday the Panthers stop-
ped Carnegie Tech Tartans for the
second time. 6%-2%, at Alcoma. Tony
Kaye posted the medal score of 73
when he took Bobby Cameron 5
and 4.

For their season record thus far
the Blue and Gold linksmen have
compiled a total of three wins against
the same number of losses. In As-
sociation play the Panthers have won
one and lost one, entitling them to
a toe-hold on fourth place in the
EIA standings, southern division.

GEORGE CLIFTON

try for points

DEL ANDERSON
against Hoosiers

Indiana’s chief weakness lies in
the jumping events, Dave McDow-
ell, a Panther from Gary, will out-
jump any of his home state rivals
in the high jump; Frank Ohl will
out-distance any of the Hoosiers in
the broad jump with McDowell; and
George Clifton, dependable senior,
should soar higher than his oppon-
ents in the pole vault.

Inconsistent Johnny Bazyk will
have his work cut out for him in
both the shotput and discus throw
when he matches heaves with I‘I’1.‘.‘I‘xS
of Indiana. Ted Konetsky will make
Harris press in the latter event, but
the nod will have to go to Harris
there. Bazyl: s:-ould cop the shot.

There is no room for debate con-
cerning the outcome of the mile rc-

lay, for Pitt's Penn Relay titlist team
is far superior to any combination
Hays can muster. '

Sophomore Women
To Honor Seniors

Sophomore women will honor
members of the senior class at 1
o’clock Monday by presenting each
of them with a rose.

This custom, which has become a
tradition, was started three years ago
by the present senior class. The wo-
men will receive their roses on the
court near Heinz chapel.

Sophomore Evelyn Green and Es-
ther Marcuson are co-chairmen of

the tribute day. They have request-
ed that all senior and sophomore wo-
men attend the ceremony whether or
not they have received an invitation.

DARTMOUTH College is now lay-
ing plans for an annual Summer
Drama Festival which will be “a
yearly exhibition of the best in the
theatre.”

FOR SMOKING PLEASURE AT ITS BEST...

F ijis,

The original college boy’s night-
mare is on again, with strong-limbed
fraters once more giving their all for
home, mother, and the All-Point
Trophy,

As if the Cap and Gown show
wasn’t enough, bony legs and hairy
chests will again be bared to the
gaze of innocent bystanders this af-
ternoon. Several of the pushers will
be brawny footballers; and if past
performances mean anything the
boys will need all the brawn and
all the stamina that they can find,
for this marathon, like the fabled
race of the tortoise and the hare, is
not to the swift but to the “tough.”

Sigma Alpha Epsnon came through
last year in a close finish, but ru-
mor has it that Phi Gamma Delta
has_ been holding nightly practice
SE3SSlOl'lS to get in shape for “sweet”
revenge. Other reports have the

houses stocking up on Wheaties and
spinach. And they’ll need it.

At 2:15 comes the lovely Float
Parade; at 3:00 comes the lovely wo-
men’s (sports); at 4:00 comes the
lov . . well anyway at 4:00 comes
the Fraternity Sweepstakes. Keep
watching Bayard Street. The frat-
ers really have something all their

own in this pushcart derby. Don’t
miss it.

As Top Rifleman

Clair K. Hoffman, BA39, has been
named as one of the top ten collegi-
ate small bore rifle shooters in the

ment from the military department.

Symbolic of the honor is a golden
bullet with which he will be pre-
sented by the National Rifle Associa-
tion.

His winning score was shot at the
National Intercollegiate small bore
rifle matches at Annapolis last
month, where the Pitt Team placed
gfourth. Second of Captain John D.
Mitchell’s boys to receive the award,
which was given last year to J. Stu-
art Diefendorf, C38, now a second
lieutenant at Fort Monroe, Va., Hoff-
man has not yet learned just where
he placed among the first ten.

Lew Mendlow struck out 15 out of
16 batters as he pitched SAM into
the championship. Outside of
Daugherty’s d.oub1e, not one Phi
Kap got so much as a loud foul off
Mendlow’s hopper. The champs,
meanwhile blasted out 20 hits, at
least half of them for extra bases.
but Phi Kappa’s cheer at the ﬁnish,
“Yeah Mendlow,” just about tells the

story. Fifteen putouts; ﬁfteen
strikeouts. What a man!

Social Note: Si;;‘ma Alpha l\v'Iu has
announced the dvmation of one keg

of beer to Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity. v

The Phi Gam-3 earned their re-
ward '-with an .3-.'n:-.7in'; 16-0 win over
Phi Delta Theta I'l.St Monday, thus
knocking SAM right into the cham-
pionship. Though Bill Angel, the
original. Phonograph who walks like
a man, was still chattering at the
ﬁnish, the Phi Delts never had a
chance before the Fiji attack and
the 5-bit twirling of Bob Quick.

The new fraternity champs meet
the engineering winners from Oil and
Gas in the first game of the play-
off series Monday at 4:00. Tuesday,
the winner of this game plays Gam-
ma-. Gamma Woo, who are quoting
mouthpiece Babe Stark, “the only
team in any of the leagues with two
good pitchers.”

The Engineering leaders, Oil and
Gas, have been suspiciously quiet.
But then I suppose that any team
which can produce 20 runs per game
doesn’t have to broadcast its prow-
ess.

The losers of Monday’s and Tues-
day’s games battle the next day for
the right to play Tuesday’s winner.
(Do you follow me?)

The marked man in this tourney
will be SAM’s Lew Mendlow. If Lew
can stop the Oil and Gas and GGW
sluggers he will deserve all the bou-
quets that have come his way. Four
o’c1ock is the time. Come up to Trees
field and see for yourself.

Tracy_:l_'y—pe Wings
'|dea| Escort’ Poll

Finally, after several hectic days
of balloting, the women of the
University have chosen their ideal
escort.

Patterned along the style of
Spencer Tracy, the ideal man must
weigh 175 pounds, have brown hair
and blue eyes. Those next in
choice were Clark Gable, Robert
Taylor, Johnny Weismuller, and
James Cagney.

At tomorrow night’s Senior Ball,
the Spencer Tracy Escort will be
picked from among the male es-
corts at the dance.

1 Proposed Merger

Proposed plans for combining
the Eitgiiieer-.i11g Association and

Mines Association have been
dropped, according to \Vi1li-ant 
Smith, E39, president of the En}
gineering Cabinet.

Immediately after the meeting of
the Engineering cabinet on Wednes-
day, a statement was issued by the
Engineering Association to the eﬁect

that “the proposed consolidation‘
would be postponed until next year
or until full and unanimous agree-
ment as to the desirability of such a
union is reached by the Mines cab-
inet.”

The reasons given for this recent
change of plans was attributed “to
the misunderstandings which have
arisen during the past week concern-
ing the proposed combination.”

The statement’ declared, “All pro-
visions set forth in the proposed
merger shall be inoperative until,
that time when fL1ll agreement is‘
reached.”

Funeral. Rites

For Follansloee
Held Today

Funeral services for Benjamin Gil-
bert Follansbce, past University trus-
tee and Pittsburgh civic and business
leader, will be held at his late resi-
dence, 4214 Bigelow Boulevard, this
afternoon at 2 o’clock.

Born on the North Side and edu-
cated in the public schools of the
city, Mr. Follansbee became a mem-
ber of the University board of trus-
lees in 1917 and served in that ca-
pacity until his retirement in 1936.

A graduate of Newell Institute,
Mr. Follansbee entered business life

Senior Queen Ritesto Resemble
English Coronation Ceremonies

By Phyllis Cohen

“The Coronation ceremony is a
public commemoration of the life and
achievement of the senior women of
the University,” according to Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women.‘

The rites for the ceremony are pat-
terned after the Coronation ceremony
oftthe English king or queen, but
adapted to an academic setting. Par-

iaphrases of lines used for centuries

in English coronations are included
in the ceremony.

The present ceremony also follows
the plan of the English coronation to
the extent that it has both religious
and secular atmosphere.

Each year a senior woman is
chosen to reign for a year as Senior
Queen. The queen is elected by pop-
ular ballot of the senior women. The
person having the next highest num-

the annual Tap Day, when the name
of the queen is also revealed. Coro-
nation ceremonies are held the day
before Commencement.

“The Senior queen is a symbol,”
says Miss Amos. “In choosing one
girl to receive the official crown, the
members of the class not only honor
her as a person, but also see in her
and honor in her, their own personal
attainment. They pay tribute to her,
and through her to their own ideal
of what a woman graduate of the

Miss Amos believes further that
“the whole rite invites one to the life
of the mind and the spirit, to friend-
ship, to social and civic responsibil-
ity, and to the ideals of ﬁne woman-
hood. In itself it speaks of Beauty,
Truth, and Goodness and calls every
senior to further enrichment of life
through cultivation of those eternal
virtues.”
