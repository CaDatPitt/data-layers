Navy begins convoy

operation

in Gulf  

for Kuwaiti tankers

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The
U.S. Navy began a new convoy
operation for reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers Tuesday, just one.day af-
ter American ships destroyed lra-‘
nian off-shore platforms in the
central Persian Gulf. .

The Pentagon, in a brief state-
ment, said the new convoy began
sailing from Kuwaiti waters

around 9:30 a.m. local time (2:30 _

a.m. EDT), steaming southward
toward the Strait of Hormuz.
The convoy consists of.two
reflagged Kuwaiti ships — the
80,000-ton product carrier
Ocean City and the 46,000-ton li-

~quified petroleum tanker Gas

King — and the -guided-missile
frigate USS Ford, the Pentagon
said. J

”The convoy is now progress-
ing uneventfully in the central
Gulf,” the Pentagon added.

The latest convoy is the 12th
since PresidentReagan ordered
U.S. military forces to begin pro-
tecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers
in mid—July.
- The Pentagon refused to locate
the convoy in greater detail, cit-

ing operational security. It thus
was not clear when the convoy
might pass the area east of
Bahrain where four Navy destroy-
ers attacked two Iranian platforms
on Monday. .

i That attack, which resulted in
the destruction of the two plat-
forms, was ordered by the presi-
dent in reta|iati_on for last week’s
attack on the Sea Isle City,
another reflagged tanker. The Sea
Isle City was struck by an Iranian
Silkworm missile last.Frida_y, in-
juring more than a dozen crew-
men and blinding the American
captain.

The Ocean City and Gas/King‘ ’

arrived in Kuwait on Oct. 13

along with the Sea Isle City and

a fourth tanker, the Gas Princess.
The Sea Isle City was never
loaded for the return trip out of
the Gulf because of the damage
done by the Iranian missile. The
Pentagon declined comment to-
day when asked why the Gas
Princess was not part of the latest
convoy, but sources who asked
not to be named said the ship
hadn't been loaded as yet.

The first of the annual Stu-
dent Government Board can-
didate functions took place at
the William Pitt Union last
night.

Representatives from four of
the university's largest and
most active student groups
were there to ”meet the can-
didates” currently running for
board positions for the
1987-88 term.

Candidates running for SGB
president are Craig Jackson
and Robert A. Reddy.‘ Kent»
Baldauf, Nan Beal, Kyle
Durham, Robert Fazion, Daryl
Grecich, Tanya Jackson, Matt
Pritt, Pamela Rich (incum-
bent), Jon Scanlon and Curt
Toll are candidates for board
positions.

This program was held in
order for these governance

. groups to get better acquaint-
ed with the candidates them-
selves, in order forthe groups
to better their own choices for
possible endorsement.

Jeff Carpenter, chairman of
the existing board's elections
committee, said he felt the

A program went extremely well.

”We do this every year and
I think we had a very good tur-
nout this year,” said Car-
penter. ”The purpose of the
program is to help the.gover-
nance groups decide on the
candidate or candidates they
wish to endorse, and I think
those which were in atten--
dance got an extremely good
sampling of what they can ex-
pect from each of the can-
didates.

”Another very good thing is
that we had four of the major
{governance} groups there,"
he continued, ”and the candi-
dates were asked very intrigu-
ing questions by them.”

’’I think the evening went
very well, and the candidates
handled themselves quite ad-
mirably,” said current SGB
president Phil Moyer. -”The
candidates right now are learn-
ing a lot, and you can tell
this.” . j ‘ J _

Major V issues ‘discussed in-

SGB candidates give views,

cluded campus safety, aca-
demic\ and recreational
facilities, _, academic and
recreational events, modern
”safe_‘ sex” dispensaries and an
increase in student/.administra-

; tion communication. .

All of the candidates agreed

in they would actively petition
» for a greater channel of com-

munication between the
governance groups and the
Student Government Board
itself.

Presidential candidate Jack-
son, if elected, said he, ”plans

to avoid the pitfalls which

sometimes V make the Student
Government Board in-
effective.”

Reddy said he is campaign-
ing for more direct input from
the student body concerning
real student problems. .”l’ll
possibly do this by opening a
channel through The Pitt
News for opinions surveys,”
said Reddy.

NEW YORK —- The Dow Jones

A record amounts Tuesday, then
results turned mixed as trading
returned to New York.

The Dow Jones industrial aver-
age rose 102.27 points to
1,841.01 in near-record—heavy
trading, according to a prelimi-
nary reading. The Dow average
had fallen 508 points on Monday
in a decline that rivaled the worst
of the Great Crash of 1929.

In spite of the Dow industrials’
roller-coaster climb, declining is-
sues outnumbered advancing
ones nearly two to one on the
New ,York Stock Exchange.
Stocks traded over the counter
were hit even harder.

The previous_record-point rise
in the Dow industrials was 75.23
on Sept. 22. In a day of indeci-
sion, the index gained as much"

as 200 points in early trading and
later was briefly 26 points below
Monday's close.

Reagan said there

won't be a recession

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, buoyed by the parital
recovery of the stock market,
declared Tuesday, ”There is noth-
ing that has happened here that
should result in a recession.

”EconomiC fundamentals in
this country remain sound, and
our citizens should not panic,”
Reagan said after an extraordi-
nary meeting with Federal

"Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Treasury Secre-
tary James A. Baker ill to discuss
the chaos that had been gripping
the stock market. '
The president noted that he
signed an order Tuesday im-
plementing the automatic spend-
ing cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduc-
tion law but said he would prefer
that the administration and con-
gressional leaders negotiate an
agreement to reduce the red ink.

Reagan appeared to soften his

opposition toboth a tax increase
and to a ”budget summit” long
advocated by congressional
Democrats.

‘'1 am willing'to participate in
anything that will bring us
together,” he told reporters as he
left the White House to visit his
wife in the hospital.

As for Democratic demands
that he accept a tax increase as
a means of reducing the defict,
Reagan said, ’’I am willing to look
at whatever proposal they might
have/’

Reagan .praised the action of

the Federal Reserve earlier in the
day to, make emergency-loan
money more readily available to
the nation's banks, saying it had
”a salutory effect on the
markets.”

He also said that he had been
in close touch with leaders of
other major industrial nations.

Reagan denied a projection,
prepared by a senior White
House economic advisor, that the
nation might face a recession as
early as next spring, barring a dra-
matic reversal of the stock mar-
ket plunge. '

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, Gctober 21, I987

PITTSBURGH (AP) — A Soviet-
born woman who was separated
from her family by Nazi soldiers
44 years ago has been reunited
with her brother in Moscow, just

. a month after learning he was still

alive.

”We hugged and we wept,”
Galina Petrova Tokarsky, 63, of
suburban Wilkins Township, told
The Pittsburgh Press in an article
published Tuesday. _

”We talked all night. I was so
happy that I wasn't at all tired the
next day,” she said.

Tokarsky met her brother, Yuri
Petrov, 62, in the lobby of a
Moscow hotel on Oct. 7, a few,
days after she arrived in the
Soviet Union for a vacation. She

Jet crashes into hotel

By Doug Richardson

Associated Press Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — A military
jet crashed a mile short of Indi-
anapolis International Airport
runway Tuesday, plowing into a
hotel where at least 14 people
died and others were injured as

' the plane exploded in a ”fire-

ball,".authorities and witnesses
said.

Up to 25 people were missing,
and 14 were confirmed dead in
the accident at the seven-story
‘Ramada Inn Airport, which oc—
curred just after 9 a.m., said

' the Indianapolis

planned the trip before learning
he was still alive.

Despite the decades of separa-
tion, she said she knew Petrov
was her brother the minute she
saw him.

”I saw a man standing there 

waiting  and I knew he was my
brother,” she told the newspaper.
”We had been children together,
but now we were grownups,
strangers.”

Tokarsky last saw her family in
May 1943 when Nazi sbldiers
took her from her home in

. Smolensk, about 225 miles west

of Moscow, for forced labor in
Germany.

In 1949, she married an Ameri-
can serviceman and, after living

Robert Duncan, an attorney for
Airport
Authority.

Up to 10 people were trans-
ported to area hospitals, said Lar-
ry Curl, a spokesman for the fire

department rescue units on the ‘I

SC€|"I€.

The A-7D Corsair jet was at-
tempting to make an emergency
landing after an engine flameout,
according to the Federal Aviation
Administration. It went down
about one mile east of the airport,
first hitting a bank building and
then slamming into the north side
of the building.

briefly in Louisiana, they settled
outside Pittsburgh and had six
children. Her husband died in
1980. ..

Tokarsky had no knowledge of
what happened to her parents
and brother until Sept. 19, when
she‘ received a letter from the
mayor of Erlangen, West Germa-
ny,'saying her mother, Maria
Petrova, was alive and had
sought his help in finding her
daughter.

Six days later, she received a
phone call from her brother in
Russia in which she learned her
mother had died in 1982.

”My mother never gave up
hope of finding me,” she said.

killing 14

The hardest hit areas were the
second and third floors of the
hotel, with the point of impact at
the second floor, just above the
main lobby. Black smoke poured
from the building, and the plane
was wedged in the lobby area of
the hotel.

The pilot of the plane, assigned
to a test unit at Nellis Air Force
Base, Nev., bailed out before the
crash, the Pentagon said in a
statement from Washington.

He was identified as Maj.

' Bruce Teagarden, 35. No
. hometown was given. He was

taken to Methodist Hospital in
good condition.

She said her brother wrote the
mayors of many German cities,
soliciting their help in finding her.
In his correspondence, he used
his mother's name, even after her
death, believing officials would
be more likely to help a mother
hunt for her daughter than a
brother find his sister.

Petrov told her German sol-

diers took him to Germany in ‘

1944. After the war, he returned
to Russia and became a lawyer.

Her father, meanwhile, was
sentenced to two years hard labor
in Siberia because he had helped
maintain roads in Smolensk,
which the Germans occupied
during the war. He was then ex-
iled to the outskirts of Minsk in

Byelorussia, where her mother ’
supported him by working as a,

seamstress.
”There was no political in-

volvement,” Tokarsky said. ”The 

family was just plain hungry. He
had to maintain the roads or else
be killed. Then later, he was

punished just for trying to

survive.” -

Tokarsky said her dream now

is to have her brother, who is

divorced and has little contact 3

with his two children, come live
with her in the United States.

”He is alone now,” she said.
”He would love to -live in the

United States, and I would love I

to have him with me.",

For The Pitt News

Many people, regardless of
their age, are being diagnosed as
having a chronic illness. Trying to
cope .with these illnesses is a
difficult experience to face, and
to do-it alone is virtually impos-
sible. A book has now been writ-
ten to help those who suffer from
chronic illnesses such as: arthri-

tis,,A;‘,Park,in_son’d,s disease, systemic

Sefra Kobrin Pitzele gives support to chronic disease suffers.

lupus erythematosus and count-
less others.

Sefra Kobrin Pitzele, author of
the book We Are Not Alone:
Learning To Live With Chronic
Illness, is a victim of systemic lu-
pus erythmatosus. This disease,
as stated in her book, causes the
body to actually turn against itself
and attack tissues like joints, skin
or internal organs. ‘It has been
known to affect young women of

child-bearing age. The ratiodof

women to men who get this dis-
ease is eight to one. Early symp-
toms can be fatigue, muscle
aches, fever, chest pains and a

rash. What makes this disease so ’

difficult to be diagnosed is the
fact that it mimics other illnesses.
If it is caught early, the chances
of leading a fairly normal life are
increased.

This book does not deal specifi-
cally with the life of Sefra Kobrin
Pitzele but that of helping people
who suffer from chronic illness-
es. it discusses diagnosing the dis-
ease, getting proper medical care
and gives helpful advice to make
a sufferer’s life easier. The book
also uses humor to help ease the
transition of accepting the illness.

Pitzele is vice president of the
Minnesota Chapter of the Lupus
Foundation of America and
serves on the board of directors
of the Sjogren’s Foundation. She
has been the speaker at numer-
ous conferences dealing. with
health care. She also has been
known to make guest appear-
ances for radio and te_|evision
shows.

Pitzele knew just six months af-
ter being diagnosed that she
wanted to -write a book. It all
came about when she was una-

ble to find information on her,

Surrender doesn't
meet expectations

By Ike Shibley
Staff Writer

Many of the individual scenes
in Surrender are terrific. Several
of them caused outbursts of
laughter from nearly everyone in
attendance, including myself.
There are select moments when
the movie borders on greatness.

The list of acting credits in this

movie is impressive. The lead
roles are played by Sally Field
and Michael Caine, who have
‘won three Academy Awards be-
tweenthem. The supporting cast
includes Steve Guttenberg, Peter
Boyle, Jackie Cooper and Julie
Kavner. Although some of the
names are not familiar the faces
‘are. This is truly a wonderful act-
ing ensemble.

The characters in the Surrender
are comically scripted. They are
refreshingly human with idiosyn-
crocies that are believably hilari-
ous. Time is taken to develop
peronalities for most of the sup-
porting cast members which
makes the movie warm and per-
sonable.

I keep wondering why, if all of
the above statements are true —
and they are — this movie was so
unfulfilling.

Jerry Belson, who co—wrote
”The Dick Van Dyke Show” and
”The Odd Couple”, wrote and
directed Surrender. His script
contained interesting character
development but little storyline
once the individual personalities
were elaborated.

The first half of the movie is up-
roariously funny.

Author shares experience in order to he

illness.

There weren't any books that
explained what she was going
through. She began writing her
thoughts into a journal. People
saw her improving and asked her
to write a book. At first, she
turned down the offer to write it.
She later‘ realized‘ that people

6‘

self-worth and have
found out that regard-

with me I am still an ok
person.

— Sefra Kobrin Pitzele

needed to be aware of how to
cope and consented to writing
the book. She was writing the
book for us, the community,
rather than for herself.

One purpose behind the book
was to make more people aware
of chronic illnesses. Pitzele stat-
ed, ’’I want each and every in-
dividual who reads my book to
know that there are other people
who have gone through similar
experiences." This is where the
title of the book We Are Not
Alone comes from.

..,»_.;,.._rg,;¢-wgiara was v1<«‘a'v~ ‘M-bl-»4I.D. - .ur'adn'-o.n-'a- s -- - — \~ -

Sean Stein (Michael Caine), is
a succesful novelist who has been
raped finacially by women he has
gotten involved with. Combined
the two females are getting
seventy percent of his-income
from books. Sean has sworn off
women as evil creatures and
plansto fly to Kuwait where, says
Sean with a cockney sway in his
voice: ”women can't vote and
you can flog them...”

In one of the funniest scenes of
the movie Sean, suffering from
his misogynistic attitude, presses
the up button for an elevator
while going to see his lawyer.
Two cars arrive at the same time.
One opens to reveal a beatuiful,
buxomous blonde, the other a
muscle-bound, mean—looki'ng
man with a Doberman pinscher
at his side. Sean, like Odysseus,
is caught between a Scylla and
Charybdis. The pretense of the
scene is so ridiculous that it is
hilarious.

Another comic scene involves
Daisy Morgan, a down-on—her-
luck painter who works at the Art
Extraordinaire Studios stamping
alpine chalets and fir trees on
mass—produced oil paintings that
hotels like the Hilton purchase as
decorations for the rooms. One
print is returned because Daisy
expressed her creativity by pa-int-
ing a drowning man in the mid-
dle of a placid lake. Her boss tells
her that the Hilton does not want
creativity, it wants uniformity.
Daisy simply shrugs at the hotel's
failure to appreciate art.

p others

Pitzele’s life is very different
from the way it was before she
was diagnosed. She has had the
opportunity to do television and
radio shows. As she stated, ’’I
have relearned my self—worth and
have found out that regardless of
what is wrong with me, lam still
an OK person." She has had the
chance to make friends with peo-
ple that she would have never
had the opportunity to meet be-
fore. She is very happy with the
life she has built for herself.

Pitzele has another book com-
ing out in January. It's a daily
meditation book called One
More Day: Meditations For Lives
Touched By Chronic Illness. She
has two books in the works but
declined speaking of them. She
did express an interest in writing
a book for teen-agers_ to help
them cope with relatives’ ill-
nesses.

If you have a relative or friend
who is suffering from a chronic
illness, it is best not to patronize
or pity them. That, would be the
worst way to help them deal with
their illness.

Same Timebut in a
different dimension

By Polly Thornton

For The Pitt News

Market Square Theatre, down-
town. spans the years of a rela-
tionship in the latest production
of Same Time Next Year, starring
Kathryn ,Fisher and Daryl
McLaughlin. '

The play describes the chang-
ing value systems of two happily
married people, George and
Doris, who meet once each year
for a weekend affair. ~

They reserve the same hotel
room each year, and throughout
the play, both take comfort in the
room being the one thing that re-
mains unchanged in their lives.

George (Daryl McLaughlin) is
introduced as a nervous business-
man tense about the affair. His
lover Doris (Kathy Fisher) is a va-

cant, intellectually dormant
housewife. ‘

A five year jump to the next
scene finds Doris a member of
the Book of the Month Club with
”an expanding vocabulary.”
Daryl McLaughlin does not ap-
pear to be completely comforta-
ble with George at this point,
which makes the character a bit
too unrealistic.

The next time they meet, Doris’
pregnancy leaves Georgefeeling
large amounts of stress. The lights
dimmed on a wel|—done scene of
George about to deliver her baby
in the hotel room and providing
an unexpectedamount of moral
support. Here McLaughlin trans-
forms George into more of a per-
son than a character.

Act two opens with George in

Painting is more than covering
walls with colored substances or
sticking fingers into jars of sticky
paint and slapping colors on
paper without any direction.

The UP Gallery helps give
pai_nting a direction in their latest
show, entitled simply Paintings.
It is a collection works by Joseph
Shepler.

Shepler, a professor at
Chatham College, has displayed
his worl, extensively over the
last 10 years. The show consists
of 14 pieces, all acrylic on
canvas

The paintings are representa-
tions of figures with the hair, eyes
and fingers distorted. ”| make it
awkward "or crude because I
don't want it to look like the real
figure,” said Shepler. ”I didn't
want to be contained in the
figure; I wanted to do it different-
ly, but not too differently.”

so the people and objects are
different, but very recognizable.
They are men and women, most-
ly not looking at each other, in

familiar environments like living
rooms.

”Everything is from experience.
I've experienced relationships,
and there is a degree of tension
in relationships,” said Shepler.

The most striking aspect of the
exhibit is his use of_ color. He uses
many different, bold colors. Stat-
ed simply, the colors work. _

When questioned about his
palette, he modestly remarked
that he was not sensitive to color

and actually used a lot of colors

straight from the tube. But his
work shows great sensitivity to
color — a brilliant knowledge of
color and how to use it.

Shepler’s first artistic endeavors
were cartoons in his youth. This
memory of cartoons comes
through in his paintings. They are
drawings with paint on canvas,
instead of drawings with pencil
on paper. . _

”I don't make a sketch on the
canvas before -I paint. I have an
idea, and I make a lot of small
sketches of watercolors,” said
Shepler. Then he works on the
painting, selecting items from the
preliminary drawings if needed.

own work to teaching, he said, ’’I

don't go near this in teaching. I ‘ 
teach the basics.” Shepler stress- '  
es individual growth after being-

taught fundamentals.

THeY’Re NOT cxazr.’

~ THE.PlTT NEWS, "Wednesday, October 2], 1987

   
  

COUDKOIJ

  

  
 

The legacy is aliveand well

I strongly disagree with your
editorial of Oct. 5, ”A march in
a small town, a dying Iegacy.”

It is erroneous to assume that
the racist Klan is a dying breed in
this country. We cannot calculate

‘ their enrollment numbers. But the

fact that they exist and travel to
all areas of the country to put
forth their racist, right-wing ideol-
ogy, must be strongly and

— vigorously protested. You would

not let an infected sore alone
without aggressive treatment. We
must not allow this insidious and
dangerous racist cancer show it-
self without aggressive oppo-
sition. '
The reasons we must protest
the Klan’s racism is because first,
our country remains in a tenuous
economic condition. Plant shut-
downs, exporting jobs overseas,
wage concessions and minimum-
wage jobs have made competi-
tion for the scarce, decent wages
more competitive. That is why
the Klan went to a town in Maine

last week, where there has been I

a strike by paper workers.

The Klan’s purpose was to
spread the racist gospel that white
workers are losing their jobs to
minorities, women and im-
migrant workers. Their divide
and conquer theme has always
been used in this country to keep
the races and the workers apart.
This has been used to prohibit
unity and a progressive together-
ness. Whenever there is econom-
ic insecurity people will find a
scapegoat to ease their pain.

Second, racism is not dead in
this country. Witness our own ci-
ty's recent episodes of racist vio-
lence. While Ronald Reagan has
not donned a white robe, he
might as well have due to his ra-
cist policies. His administration
has fought against affirmative ac-
tion. Reagan cries that the white

male is being discriminated‘

against and calls this reverse dis-

  
 

cri-rninat'On-..His cutbacks in so-

LETTERS

‘

cial programs have directly
affected minorities. And he nomi-
nated a man (Robert Bork) to the
Supreme Court who see_s nothing
wrong with the poll tax and
seperate public accomodations.

Through these, Reagan has
promoted racist attitudes. He tries
to make it clean-looking.

Third, the Klan in Lancaster
spoke against homosexuals. This
is very dangerous at this time of
the AIDS scare. Discrimination
against homosexuals and lesbians
is frightening because they are
seen as an easy target and as a
way of allaying people's fears of
AIDS. »

We must study history. Should
Hitler and the Nazis have been
left alone? Because German 50-
cialists and communists in their
protests received no support from
other sectors of the German so-
ciety; they were the first execut-
ed. The rest is history.

Finally, protests are not a dying
legacy. This is a myth. Because
within a two-decade period we
had civil rights, anti—Vietnam war
and women's movements which
proved effective. These produced
social change and changed the
face of our nation. The myth is
kept alive to prevent people from
coming together to the common
ground (as Rev. Jesse Jackson
states) and from openly and free-
ly protesting against injustice and
working for justice, peace and
equality.

events im Tibet,_ where the
Chinese continue to supress and
oppose the cultural and religious

traditions of the Tibetan people
and to the Reagan administra-
tion’s_ reaction to these events.
For those not familar with the his-
tory and the extent of the oppres-
sion, a [New York Times]
editorial of Oct 8 would inform
them that among other atrocities,
”[in the 19605], more than 1 mil-
lion people [of a total population
of 7 to 8 million] died in work
camps, and more than 6,000
monastaries were destroyed, their
icons and paintings looted and
sold.”

This tragedy may be filed with

other 20th century crimes against -

humanity, such as the Armenian

death march in the early '20s, the :

Stalinist purges and the Jewish
Holocaust. '

Having lived and travelled ex-
tensivly in Tibet's southern neigh-

bor, the Kingdom of Nepal, I.

have met many Tibetan refugees
and have learned much about
their culture. Despite the events

of the past 37 years, they are a_

friendly and- peace—loving people,
whose 2,000—year history shows
that they follow the non—violent
precepts of- Gauthama Buddha
much more closely than many

still

Christians have followed those
same teachings of Jesus Christ.‘

In a news conference given at
his exiled headquarters in North-
ern India, the Dalai Lama, the
spiritual and theocratic leader of
Tibet, said, ”Vio|ence is not the
proper way at all. It is almost sui-
cidal.” He then renewed his call
for civil disobedience, a concept
taught by Buddha some 500
years before the birth of Christ.
Tibet was an isolated country be-
fore 1950; how the hell could
they have enemies? [...]

I am outraged, though not sur-
prised, by the reaction of the Rea-
gan administration to this latest
round of killings, arrests and des-
truction, which was the subject of
the [New York Times] editorial;
our gang in the White House
feels that condemming the
Chinese, or even expressing em-
pathy for the Tibetan people and

their strife, would undercut the ,

recent moderate measures being
proposed in Beijing. That ”the
State .Department hesitates to
stand up for decency” (Times
Op-Ed, Oct. 8) demonstrates how
warped and misguided Reagan's
foreign policy is, not only in this
hemisphere, but in many parts of
the world as well.

Does this all seem a little odd to you?

a gap: Men are changing but so‘.-_ 
. are women's expectations. I ‘

First of all, I must confess that
I'm a sucker for ”Can This Marri-
age Be Saved?" articles. You
know the kind I mean. First we
get Her story, then we get His sto-

” ry. Then we get generic all-

purpose advice from the ther-
apist: "What Jim and Judy need
to do is learn to communicate,
share their feelings and stay in
therapy until we get back to them
next month.”

Nevertheless, despite a high
tolerance for Tales From The

Relationship Crypt, I couldn't .

bear the latest Hite report. Nine
hundred pages of depressing cor-
respondence entitled Women
and Love?‘Nine hundred pages of
Her story, or to be specific, 4,500
Herstories? Nine hundred pages
of comments on things like
”Men's trashy behavior and bad
manners" and why ”Most wom-
en are unable to get their relation

ships to change”? '

.Each time I crawled through
Shere Hite’s American love
desert, a barren place littered
with abuse, silence and misun-
derstandings, to some -tiny oasis
of happiness, I wanted to stand
up and cheer. "I am so in love
with myhusband. I'm in love
with him because he's such fun
to be with: I trust him implicitly.”
Atta girl. Way to go kids.

Each time I heard a male voice
in this all
however damaged by Hite’s
commentary — I felt a peculiar

female chorus — _

urge to root for the underdog.
"There is something to be said for
male patterns of a certain amount
of privacy and distance.” Sure
there is. I'm not entirely sure
what, but there must be.

Author and polemicist Hite

made her fame and fortune,

reporting on female and male
sexuality. Her method, such as it
is, is to pass out questions, turn
the answers into a "study," sprin-
kle it liberally with her own po-
litics, then‘ lob the whole package
into the public arena and watch
it explode. This time, Women
and Love landed all over Time
magazine.

Hite is, and I suspect intends to
be, less of a reporter than a
provocateur. As a scribe of the
skirmishes of the sexes, there is
no question who's side she's on.
"This book is,” she writes in the
preface, ”... a celebration of each
other and the greatness of
women.”

To achieve this celebration,
Hite gave 100,000 take—home es-
say questionaires to women on
the subject of their relationships.
She got back answers from 4.5
percent. Assuming that discon-
tented people are much more
likely to spend their nights on
127 essay questions, these 900
pages are slanted toward the most
unhappily relating women in
America.

Consider the" statistics of the
Hite gripe sampler: 95 percent of

the women say they experience
emotional and psychological
harassment from men in their
relationships; 88 percent say men
avoid talking about problems; 83
percent say men don't under-
.-stand the basics of intimacy; and
‘then, perversly, 67 percent of
these women say men complain
more than they do. '

There is good reading here
among these women's lives,
rather like snooping through a

true confession record. But there,

is little surprise. It is no news
bulletin that women long for
"communication," rich, layered
talk about feelings with the men
they love. It's hardly a secret that
women today suffer "relationship
burnout,” exhausted from carry-
ing a work—and-caring overload.
Nor is it a flash that there is still

In my own life, I assume 50
percent of the blame in any rela- ’
tionship. Sometimes I get off .- 
lucky. In Hite's'world, however, _  

"It is men's attitudes toward
women that are causing the

Droblem.” This blanket indict-" 

ment, this wholesale imbalance,

distorts the value and indeed the '7

truths spoken by many women.

It is too bad that neither of their  
respondants nor Hite give much ‘._

credence to men who are trying

to achieve their own internal‘, _
balance: to be strong and not si-I -

lent. What is missing from this

'’report” is what we in the news 

business call "the other side of

the story.” You don't know much- 
about relationships until you get,
inside both partners. Again and‘
again, reading a wife's lament —.

”even though my husband says

we'll talk each day, he just talks“ — 
for two minutes before he goes to I ,_ ;
sleep, about himself.” I wanted to 

hear from her "other.", ,

But man—bashing is not the

worst of Hite’s crimes. Shallow- _ 

ness is. A massive collection like
this ought to have dialogue —

— between men and women. All . M 

Hite will move is books.‘

Well, we took a vacation last
week. Combine the. miniscule
papers and a catastrophic illness
on my part, and the result was a
week without the Naked City. To
paraphrase Anita Bryant, "A
week without the Naked City is
like a week without sunshine."

While we're on the subject of
Anita Bryant (does anyone out

there remember her?), today is

Jeans Day. "Well what does An-
ita baby have to do with jeans?”

Well, it's like this:

Have you seen the signs that
read, "Attention!!! If you're gay,
or support gay rights, wear your
blue jeans on Wednesday, Oct.
21.” The following is not an
editorial on gay rights, it's an in-
terview with two of the people
behind Pitt's Jeans Day. After all,
the Naked City is an apolitical
place. It's actually a state of mind,
but it's -kind of fun to refer to it
as a place.

Chris and Richard are members
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Pitt. The GALAs at both Pitt
and CMU are sponsoring this
Jeans Day based on similar- events
held at CMU and IUP previously.

Richard told me, "The idea for
Jeans Day came up at ourfirst
meeting, four weeks ago. Mem-
bers thought it was a great idea,
and here it is."‘ , - '

I asked him what.the'purpose

I of theevent is, and he replied,

safe. We're trying to raise cons-
ciousness about something that
we [the gay community] have to
do every day."

I asked Chris, "Why jeans?” To
which she replied, "Because
everyone wears jeans, it necessi-
tates their making a decision as
to wear them or not. You can't
just ask people to actively partic-
ipate, you have to force it be-
cause most people are too
fucking lazy to make an effort."

I asked them if they had publi-
cized the event enough, and they
told me that they had printed up
some 300 signs and posted them
all over Oakland. However, most
of the signs were torn down
quickly, sometimes as they
watched.

Chris was quick to point out
that some people‘ are aware of
what's going on today. Yesterday,
after her History of the Holocaust
class, an anonymous classmate
came up to her and asked her
"What’s all this Jeans Day shit?”

The aforementioned classmate

had no idea that Chris was in-

volved in this project.

_Ch'ris told her that,"If you're
gay, or support gay«rights=,_you're

ed, "Oh, God, I'll have to be sure
to wear a skirt."

As Chris was relating this story
to me, Richard was also hearing
it for the first time. He said,
“What are they teaching in there,
Holocaust appreciation? I
thought that class was meant to
eliminate prejudice through edu-

‘cation,"’ Good point there,

Richard.

I really don't care if you're go-
ing to wear jeans or not. I don't
particularly care ‘how you feel
about gay rights. Once again, this
isn't an editorial.

But think about what GALA is
trying to do here. Think real hard
about the story,Chris told about
her class and Richard's reaction
to her story. These two are
definitely off the beaten path, and
they are warmly welcomed as
new citizens of the Naked City.

In other departments of the
Naked City, I got aletter two

THE PITT NEWS

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Bubby
Brister, angry about his demotion
to third—team quarterback, lashed
out at Pittsburgh Steelers Coach
Chuck Noll on Tuesday, claiming
he is being punished for ‘refusing

to play during the NFL strike.

”I always thought the guy with
the most talent was supposed to
play, but that's not the way it is
around here,” he said.

Brister wondered whether the
Steelers are making an example

Gottfrie ta

Editor in Chief

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried ap-
peared troubled about the Pan-
thers ‘upcoming game with the
Navy Midshipmen at his weekly
press conference at Pitt Stadium
yesterday.

But considering his team's
schizophrenic tendencies, who
can blame Gottfried.

”We’ve learned enough les-
sons here in the past ourselves.
I'm concerned about Navy. We
have to play a disciplined football
game,” Gottfried said.

It is, indeed,‘hard to fathom
how the 4-2 Panthers beat

’ Brigham Young on the road and

Notre Dame (ranked fourth in the
country at the time) at home and,
yet, lost’ to Temple and Boston
College at home.

Those games are obvious indi-

 cators of incongruities in the '87
Panthers play. But they're not the

only ones, either.

Consider this:

0 Pitt has outscored its oppo-
nents 99-19 in the first half, but
the Panthers have been outscored
60-29 in the second half. '

0 Only two opponents . —
Brigham Young and West Vir-
ginia — have had more first
downs than Pitt in the Panthers

_ six games this season, yet Pitt

won both games.

0 Sophomore wide receiver
Reggie Williams, who caught I7
passes in slightly over two games
last year, leads the team with 19
receptions after six games this
season.

So what's all that mean?

Well, the Panthers aren't a
second— half team; first downs
don't win football games, and the
emphasis of the Pitt offense this
year is on the running of Craig
”lronhead” Heyward.

For Gottfried, these stats mean
even less. ”As long as we win, I
don't care what the stats show.”

But of course, none of this
should matter in Annapolis, Md.,
on Saturday afternoon.

Navy (I-5 this season) isn't too
good this year, and everybody
knows it.

The Midshipmen, who have
lost to, among others, William
and Mary and Lehigh, while
trouncing Ivy League Penn 38-28,
might not have the fortitude to

* beat some of Pitt's better in-‘ "

out ‘of him because he wouldn't
cross the picket line with 18 other
regulars. He also questioned
whether he has a future in Pitts-
burgh now that replacement
team QB Steve Bono is backing
up starter Mark Malone.

’’I could see them demoting me
ifl had been rebellious during the

strike, if I had been carrying‘

around a shotgun or dogs or chas-
ing people around,” Brister said.
”But I thought it was pretty mild
around here. I feel like I haven't
done anything to lose my job.”

Noll, at his weekly news con-

  

Craig Heyward, shown diving over the Notre Dame defense, has been the focal point of Pitt's offense.

down by the Chesapeake River.

He expects a tough ballgame.

”Navy has continued to im-
prove as a football team all sea-
son. You have to judge them on
the last two weeks, they've been
a different team,” said Gottfried.

While many people are look-
ing forward to the Panthers’
showdown with Syracuse at Pitt

Stadium on Oct. 31, Gottfried‘

prefers to take the season one
game at a time. '
He knows Pitt's 30-22 win over

. Notre Dame gave the Panthers

some national exposure. But,
even more‘ importantly, the week
Pitt had off following the game

gave the Panthers a chance to _

”missed a golden opportunity” to
win the quarterback’s job from
Malone by not playing during the
strike. ‘
”Maybe they're trying to make
an example out of me  I know
they’re making examples out of
guys on a few teams,” Brister

. said. ’’It was quite obvious I beat

him [Bono] out in training camp,
and I'll beat him out again. It
wasn't any contest.

”It’s nothing against Steve be-
cause I like the guy, but I put a
lot of hard work into this job, and

Siragusa and fullback Prentiss
Wright, would have had to sit out
if Pitt played last week, accord-
ing to Gottfried.

As of yesterday, all five players
were questionable for the Navy
game. I

With Pitt at the midway point
of the season, Gottfried feels he
has a better feel for this team as
opposed to last year's.

”This is a little bit different ball-
club [than last year's], but I think
I know our strengths and weak-
nesses and what we need to im-
prove on. Whereas last year I was
still trying to evaluate talent, and
I_ still didn't know what we were
really working with,” :said

Pitt's Smith takes 'em one game at a time?

By Christopher Sepesy

Staff Writer

Carnel Smith sincerely hopes
his time has come.

Just don't ask him about it.

”What I believe in, is thinking
only about the game you have to
play and nothing else,” he said.
"Right now, all that is on my
mind is the game this weekend
against Navy, and that is the way
it will be until Saturday night.”

Smith has earned his right to be
so forward with his thoughts. The
6-foot-3, 240-pound sophomore
defensive end has increasingly
shown both prowess and stami-
na on the gridiron for the Pan-
thers this season.

In six games this season, he has
-played more than half of "each,
and he started in the game against

North Carolina State when the
regular starter, Burt Grossman,
was out with an injury.

And in this time, Smith has
racked up a pretty good set of
statistics.

He has two sacks, four hurries,
and 29 tackles, T2 of which are
unassisted. ,

"Carney is really a gut player,”
said Pitt coach Mike Gottfried.
"One of the best things about
him is that he feels good
whenever he's out on the football
field and it shows to the rest of
the team.

"He’s quick, strong, agile and
very talented and he can really
assist well in tackles. He's a very
disciplined player. He's going to
be a strong asset for our team for
quite some time to come," he
added.

According to Smith, the key
word in the above quote is dis-
cipline.

"One of the biggest problems
in our two losses this season is we
weren't always playing with the
maximum amount of discipline
we could have been," said Smith.
'’All I have to do is relate it back
to the Temple game. Football is
a very physical and challenging
Contact sport. You can't go into
a game, no matter how hard you
try, with a lackadaisical attitude
or else you're never going to be
able to win that game.

”And even if you're up by
many points during the second
half, if you slack off and lose your
nerve somehow, then the other
team is going to come back and
possibly take the victory away
from you,” he added. ”We just
can't let that happen anymore
during this season. We've let too
much go already.”

But Smith contends with‘ the
way the team has been perform-
ing of late, there should be no
problem in the team's discipli-
nary habits.

He said after the 30-22 upset

 

 

win over'Notre Dame, a feeling a 

of pride overcame the team and
they are not yet ready to see it slip
away with futile mistakes.

"We’re in a good situation. , 

Now all we have to do is go out

and execute what we preach. I I 

figure if we go out and perform A
for the team instead of just for

ourselves, then our goals of vic- 4' ’ 

tory and hopefully a bowl game
will be in reach," Smith said.

And how does Smith see him-,,;.' I T

self fitting into this?

"I see myself as a gratuity man ~ ll:-"'1

— whatever they ask, I'll do it."

By Kelly Witt
Staff Writer g

Nora Mulvihill, a key member
of the Lady Panther volleyball
team will miss another week of
play "due to torn ligaments in her
ankle.

Mulvihill was injured recently
in a match against Florida State.
’’It was the third game in the ser-
ies, and a girl came under the net.
I landed on her and twisted my

ankle out,” said Mulvihill.

Mulvihill will be out for four of
the next home matches. Coach
Shelton Collier said, ”She’s in the
process of trying to rehabilitate.
We're aiming for Nov. 1.”

The Lady Panthers are 26-2,
and Mulvihill has been a key rea-
son for this winning record.

Last year, she was named to the
first team All—Big East conference.

This year, she's led the team to
key wins over Georgetown, LSU

the best season ever,” said
Collier.

One of the biggest ever recruit-
ing battles between Pitt and Penn
State was over Mulvihill. She
went back and forth a few times,
but Pitt won out in the end.

Ironically, Mulvihill wasn't
able to play last weekend when
Pitt hosted Penn State. ’’l was
really looking forward to this.
Hopefully, I'll be able to play
against them later in the year.”

We have to pull together and fo-

said Collier. '

Mulvihill also thinks that the
team can pull together. ”We have
a lot more depth on our team

someone isn't as vital,” she said.

Mulvihill thinks the team is bet-
ter as a whole this year. ”lt’s been

ing to cheer me up,” she said.

Penn State needs some rest sa

Before the Oct. 31 game
against West Virginia, Paterno
said his injured players would
have a chance to heal, and youn-
ger players would get more prac-
tice time.

Syracuse defeated Penn State
48-21 on Saturday in the Carrier
Dome, the Nittany Lions’ worst
beating since a 44-7 loss to Notre
Dame in 1984.

”Our problem is, basically,
hurt people,” Paterno said. ”lt’s
not a question of making
changes. It's a question of getting
better and getting healthy.”

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn
State football players may not
want to wait to avenge the team's
worst thrashing in three years, but
Coach Joe Paterno said on Tues-
day a week's rest is what they
need most.

”They’d like to get back at
somebody this coming week, but
with our injuries and everything
else, the week off is really a bless-

said at his weekly press con-
