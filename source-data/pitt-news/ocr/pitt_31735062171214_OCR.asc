New Measures

 Security Crackdown Set

by SHERRI ZIPPAY

In response to approximately
130 reported thefts which oc-
curred in the Towers last year.
the University implemented sev-

‘ eral new measures.

According to John Vrana, Dir-
ector of University Housing.

every lock core was changed in _

each of the three towers. Stu-
dents living in the towers for the
fall term received the first keys
to the rooms. Each key is coded
so that the location of the room
will not be known if the key is
lost. -

_Lt. Robert K. Merritt, new sup-
erintendent of Security here, has
instituted stringent measures to
prevent last year's flood of thefts
in the campus dormitories.

“We now have a security
desk operating in each tower."
Vrana said. "and we hope that
the new lock system, the new
security desks. and the new
awareness of the problem will
tremendously reduce the num-
ber of thefts in the towers‘
area."

Vrana also stated that at least

_two-thirds of the thefts occurred

in open rooms. He stressed the
necessity of locking rooms when
leaving and also of‘ reporting
quickly any theft to University
security.

Assaults

Approximately 50 assaults
on students occurred in the first
three weekends of the term last
year. “Problems don't necessari-
ly repeat themselves." Vrana
said. “We no longer have wom-
en students living at Carlow Col-
lege. so there won‘t be the
same. amount of traffic between
the schoolsas in previous years."

Robert K. Merritt. newly ap-

pointed security department sup-
erintendent.‘ increased foot pat-

'rols of the Oakland area for the

“critical" period of Friday and
Saturday nights. His goal is to
include regular beat patrols on
the upper. middle. and lower
campus areas. and to increase
mounted patrols in vehicles.

Security Innovations

Merritt is interviewing can-
didates for the position of inves-
tigator. which will include hand-
ling incidents which are not
necessarily arrest situations. but
which require further investiga-
tionf _

Another innovation of the sec-
urity department is the "dorm
sergeant." who will supervise
the dormitory areas and the Stu-
dent Union in order to root out
problems. Merritt also employed
student security aides to release
professional officers‘ from low
level security duties such as sign-
ing visitors in and out of build-
ings to perform duties more ap-
propriate to their status and
training. ‘

Communication

Merritt outlined two basic areas
through which he hopes to open
communication. He wants to
hold general meetings in the de-
partment once a month to inform
the‘ men of progress and to make
them aware of existing situa-
tions. The meetings will also
make him available for questions
from the officers‘.

The second area involves a
community awareness program.
-“The citizens must help us by
calling on us." Merritt said. “We
try to communicate this to the
University community. includ-

"Many people fail to report
losses." he added. "which re-

sults in a loss of equipment not“

covered by insurance. This
equipment must then be replac-
ed by budgets which are al-
ready‘ tight. Quick reporting
would help save money by re-
covering or preventing such

‘losses. "

The University is an open
place and therefore difficult to
control. "You can't stop open-
ness in the university community
or it ceases to be a university."
Merritt stated. “but we must
reduce the number of thefts."

Merritt took over his post as
superintendent of the security
department in early august. “I
want the department to reflect
the finest standards possible -in
law enforcement." he said. “I
don‘t want the officers to fit
the stereotyped role of ‘pigs.'

Denied Dr. Koehler

by JUDY VOLLMER

Dr. Ludmila Koehler. Univer-
sity associate professor of Slav-
ic languages and literatures.
is in Pittsburgh once again af-
ter her eviction from Russia last
month. Dr. Koehler had been
traveling with several University
students on a study tour through
the Soviet Union at the time of
her eviction.

'Dr. Koehler and her students
had finished a four week Rus-
sian language course at ‘the Uni-
versity of Leningrad and were
vacationing at the International
student camp in Sochi. While
they were in Sochi. Dr. Koehler
and the students attended a
youth rally where an anti-Am-
erican Russian Resolution was
passed around for students sig-
natures. (A copy of this resolu-
tion was released at a press con-

ference with Dr. Koehler and the .

students who accompanied her
yesterday in Student Union Din-
ing Room A.)

All of Dr. Koehler's students
refused to sign the anti—American
document. and. when Dr. Koeh-
ler attempted to speak at the
microphone. she was arrested and

taken to a nearby airport. The

Russian police sent Dr. Koehler
to Moscow. then to Budapest.
Hungary where she notified the
American Embassy.

Dr. Koehler explained to the
Pitt News that she felt that the
whole trip through the U.S.S.R.,
especially the rally, was very
worthwhile. ,_.—for .- the’ students.

cause now they realize'tha’t the
Soviet government is not what
they want.”

“Youths in Russia can't travel
abroad at all and my students got

  

a long look at the isolation that
Russian youths experience." she
added. The most wonderful part
of the trip. though. was meet-
ing so many young Russians and
enjoying the closeness that they
feel toward each other and tow-
ard the young people who visit
them.“

State Program

Drug Abuse i Discussed 

The University will be one of
the sites this year for a State
Training Center‘ to familiarize
the campus and the outside com-
munity with the hazards of drug
abuse.

A The $140,000 program. admin-'

istered by the State Department

‘pare as many as 1,500 Pennsyl-

vania residents as "team lead-
ers" who will return to their
schools and jobs to disseminate
the information they acquire.

In addition to the University

rector of Special Programs, for

The procedure had taken the
students through two grueling

elections and two presidential H 
and had left“

disqualifications,
the matter unsettled at the end
of the winter term. ‘

The original election, held in
January, had Harris Miller and

his Student Community Union V. 2“

party victorious by a small mar-
gin of 18 votes. Steve Cundra,
Miller‘s opponent. appealed the.

election on the premise that 7 
many students were unable to‘ . 

vote because of procedureal dif-
ficulties.

The Election Committee, up-V

holding Cundra's appeal, called
for a re-election to be held on
February 4.

The re-election completely ‘re’-
versed the previous results.
Cundra won with a 33 vote mar-

gin and it seemed the matter’

was_settled. But again the elec-
tion was appealed, this time on
the grounds that Cundra had vio-'
lated certain rules ‘of the elec-
tions campaigning code.

The Student Government Elec-I
tion Committee '(SGEC) took up

_ investigation on the allegations

as the winter term ended with-
out any type of settlement.

The dispute was ended by the
SG Senate in April, when they
elected Klavonic. then a sena-
tor, as president of Student Gov-
ernment. The decision settled
the matter .quietly, and finally
gave the students a President.

:4“  think we’ve expressed in these posters,” said Tho-
" C mas Huff, new director of the campus YMCA.
YMCA volunteer-staffed projects provide tutors
for area students, companions for institutionalized
 ,_. . persons, and facilities for various ‘ types of en-
 ’ ~ counter situations. ‘
' Huff was asked if he felt concern qualified a:
. student to deal with an emotionally disturbed
child, or a slow learner.

F “We deal with people problenis, human eon- R

eerns,” he said. “Human beings, just by being
human, are qualified to deal with other people.
Not tomorrow, ‘When I get my head together,’
but right now.” _ .

Students volunteering for tutorial programs are
asked which subjects they are qualified to tutor.
Tutors are required to attend an orientation ses-
sion.

"Our experience has been that students don't
volunteer forithings for which they aren't quali-
fied," said Huff. "In fact, the opposite is true.
Students are afraid to volunteer for-things which
they are not really equipped to handle."

Concern Enough?

Is concern. then. enough of a reason to accept
the responsibilities of a tutor or a companion?

“If you care." said Mary Kay Bwanosky, co-
ordinator of Project ABC, a reading program for
children, "it's enough of a reason for you to vol-
unteer." ‘

...‘‘I don’t think anyone in the ‘Y is completely
motivated to help people,” added Serene Kolaltoski,
presently involved in Project Judo-Pal, an offshoot
of the Link Program. “All motives are not good
ones. But as long as what you do is good, motiva-
tion becomes less important.” ‘

According to Huff, YMCA projects serve a
two-fold purpose, ideally benefiting both the stu-

dent and the person to whom the project is dir-

ected.

“If a good, warm" feeling inside is all that a
student gets from a project, its not enough,” stat-
ed Huff. _

“When you start anything, you go into it step

_by step," said Miss Bwanosky. “You learn and

grow within yourself. It's not just a volunteer help-
ing another person. It‘s also a volunteer helping
himself." *

The tutorial programs and Project Link (a pro-
gram in which the volunteer establishes a rela-
tionship with youngsters from low income neigh-

Hborhoods in a small group situation) involve the

largest number of student volunteers, usually from
200 to 250 persons. . ~ . I

‘ Wide Range

The restof the Y's nearly‘ 500 volunteers are
involved in a wide range of other projects.

Project Light. Project Mental Hospital, and
the Juvenile Court Program are examples of
those programs which work through existing insti-

Toward a “Good Society’

Dr. Aims For Change

by SUE RUFFNER

According to~Dr. Donald Hen-
derson, the newly appointed Asso-
ciate Provost, the universities of

"today have a responsibility to so-

ciety that must be met to produce
the presently desired "good so-
ciety.“

He believes that the changes
people are clamoring for are. in
the main, changes which will ben-

efit all of society.

"The university must respond
to this call for change because in
20 years the direction of society
will depend on the people we are
now educating," the doctor of
sociology stated.

However, Dr. Henderson main-
tains that the responsibility facing
our nation’s universities has not
been treated seriously. “Every-
thing else is _more important in
our society than the quality of ed- 

ucation which will so readily in- -

fluence the future,” he asserted.

In the past. he feels, the human _

element in education has been
comprised to increase the tech-
nical or professional development
of a person. “We produce good
technicians but poor human be-
ings." -

A creative university can solve
this problem and thus make a val-
uable contribution to society by
letting students have first-hand
knowledge in a field which inter-
ests them. “Students should be

.active participants in their own

learning to widen their human ex-
perience. . . . We must realize
that people can learn out of the

~ classroom, in the real world."

In Dr. Henderson’s opinion,
schools must move in this direc-
tion if they are to fulfill their re-
sponsibilities for a better future.

During the winter term. Dr.
Henderson will teach about social
and cultural aspects of the Afro-
American experience. He believes
that Pitt's Black Studies Depart-
ment is probably better than most
but added that if suffers problems
plaguing any new field. ’ 0

He maintains. -however. that to
critically evaluate the Black Stu-
dies program in a way you would
normally criticize a field is in
appropriate.

Concerning his new position as
Associate - Provost, he plans to
work as a team with the Provost
rather than just as an extension
or an enlargement of the bureau-
cracy of the university. The re-
sponsibilities of Provost will be
split between him and Provost

The phrase “through the‘ system”
has a very negative connotation to many
young people and if our governmental

.systems remain as paranoid of students

as they-have been, the phrase will be
looked on as complete absurdity.

The University announced this sum-
mer that its students would be given the
opportunity to participate in the fall
political elections, to be afforded to

I - them by a two-day recess November 2

and 3.
That a large University like ours

_ would even sanction such a thing in the

first place aroused suspicions of it be-
ing a token gesture, and many students
were immediately turned off, contend-

1 ing that it would give the impression

that ‘they were pleased with our sys-
tem of government as it exists.

...But-on the positive side are those

_ who said that the University was on the

path to seeing that all learning all rel-
evancy is not only classroom applica-
tions. And it is not a naive assumption-

1 Student Politieing Vs. The IRS  

So now we have the University mak-
ing some kind of effort to go along with
student national concern, and what
happens? A new cog is thrown into the
operations by the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice, by handing down a list of guide-
lines which basically state “Okay chil-
dren we’ll' allow you to play in the mud
of politics but only if you do this and
don’t do this.”

On June 19. the IRS approved the
guidelines which require universities to
refrain not only from direct involve-
ment in political campaigns but also
financing student organizations
which attempt to ‘carry a political mes-
sage to the people in ways other than
they have defined.

Their ruling said that organizations
like the Young Democrats and Young
Republicans on campus are to receive
University funds only if they limit their
operations to the University community.
In other words if they go outside of
the campus politicking. but still using
campus services and funding. Pitt will
have to charge them.

This ruling seems an indication of
the light in which the IRS looks on stu-
dents.

groupwhich suggested the guidelines.
still think the only contact students
in higher education should have with
anything outside of the University. is
in reading the newspaper — and even
then. not too closely.

Universities all over the country are
struggling to achieve some sort .of
strong correlation and ties‘ with the
communities surrounding it, but by the
IRS setting these guidelines they seem
to hint at the idea that for four years
of a student's life, he's to forget that
there is a world outside of the grass,
and buildings, and books of his school.

The ruling even bans inter-campus
student correlation. It specifies: "Or-
ganizations must reimburse the univer-
sity if they permit non—members of the
University community to avail them-
selves of university facilities or serv-

rightly so. A

THEY ALSO rob intra-move-

macy of their claims.

Since most of the movement

people have been. and more
importantly. felt oppressed

to take advantage of their rela-

One of “the major contribu-

Objectivity: Something

To Strive Towards

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

With experience at Pitt comes the sad realization that tripe
is not foreign to the mouths or typewriters of students, including
campus leaders and (more distressing than all else) even friends.

It is with little relish but a sense of urgency that I respond
to the September 4 column of my friend and colleague.- Virginia
Joyce.

....As one who was present at the awards banquet to which Vir-
ginia referred. I must admit that I found dessert that evening
more palatable than the lines I read last week.

To say that there is no such thing as objectivity is ana-
logous to saying that there is no such thing as happiness. Both are
extremely difficult to achieve. But it is nonetheless vital to strive
after them, no matter how elusive they prove to be.

Surely, it’s frustrating to play Tantalus all the time. But that’s ' i ‘

journalism and that’s life.

Rather than call objectivity “a justification for reinforce-
ment of the status quo and a subtle, indirect means of oppres-
sion” as Virginia does, I would label a denial of its reality and
worth a rationalization for copping out and retreating from an un-
deniably strenuous task.

I agree with Virginia that “pseudo-journalists” can be found
in the media. Unfortunately, I often have to look no further than
The Pitt News office to gaze at some.

As for‘John 'I‘roan’s tirade in The Pittsburgh Press a couple
weekends ago, it reminded me of ten year old Freddie, who
broke up a’ wiffle ball game by taking his bat home, on the
grounds that the other fellows were cheating, when in fact he
really didn’t want to play anymore anyway. .

I'm not convinced. though. that Troan's action was any
more o_di0us than the refusal of the 25 groups to permit a report-
er to cover their conference.

I am certain that it ill becomes the Associate Editor of The
Pitt News to condone anyone's failure to cooperate with the rep-
resentative of a newspaper. whether metropolitan or collegiate.

I only hope that members of the University community don't
hold Virginia to her words. because by her doctrine. they might
properly refrain from providing her with information or refuse
her entry to a meeting. should they predetermine that her re-
porting would ‘impede their “ironing_ out inter-group conflicts
and political differences" or "indirectly cripple effective organ-
ization." . e

To accuse Post-Gazette Editor Frank Hawkins. as.Virginia
does. of “lamenting the neo-emergence of conscience in media
men and women" is to put words into his mouth. An advocate of
objectivity does not necessarily oppose advocacy. .

Once, of course, the distinction between advocacy and glib
dogmatism disappears, advocacy becomes propaganda. But co-
gent, well-researched appeals to ‘reason represent some of journa-
lism’s finest offerings.

. Ego trips are no less common on campus than anywhere else.
If the Editors of the Press and Post-Gazette must guard against

. narrow-mindedness and excessive. pride. so must Pitt's "media

mongers." who include both Virginia and myself. .

  Marbury   Disappoints As Editor

To The Editor: The Pitt News

Re your September 4 issue.
I was unsure whether to reply
or not to yoifr editorial. fear-
ing that a responsewould give
it an air of legitimacy. How-
ever. since this is the first issue
of The Pitt News that most fresh-
men have seen. it might be
dangerous for them to think that
all people at this University
harbor such thoughts.

When Don Marbury became
the campus Perry White a few
months ago. I was heartened to
see that at long last a respon-
sible and sensible person would
head the official publication
here at Pitt.

After digesting this latest ef-
fort. however. it would appear
that unfortunately Don has been
bitten by the campus zeitgeist.
i.e.. he espouses a point of view
so out of touch with reality that

he and his followers actually
come to believe it. '
Alexander Heard, President

Nixon’s special campus advisor,
recently told the President that
students feel that they are about
to be “repressed.” Objectively,

‘ there are fewer restraints on

students than ever before. Heard
noted, however, that the fact
that their belief is false does
not mean that it is not an im-
portant part of campus reality.

Your editorial was packed with
outrage» and emotion. but there
was almost no substance to it.
_You are content to bemoan the
tragedies of Kent State and
Jackson State. yet you don't make
a serious attempt to find out
why they occurred. save per-
haps a‘ grossly unfair and over-
simplified reference to Presi-
dent Nixon on the cover. ‘

You do make some reference
“sick society" and “bad
laws." I cannot, comment on
these observations because it is
impossible to ascertain the truth-
"value of statements whose con-
notations‘ are many and vague.

I can, however, offer what I
consider a reasonable proposi-
tion concerning social change
and contemporary American
Society. I would’ say that there
is no objective revolutionary
situation in America to day.

There are no serfs to free. no
absolute monarchies ‘to topple.
no mass of impoverished work-
er.s. no mass poverty. By all

objective standards. our affluence
surpasses that of any society in
history.

I don't think that we can
blame our internal strife on any
of the traditional grievances
that have triggered revolutions
in the past.

Now consider the revolution-

aries. Studies have shown that
most come from upper middle
and upper class backgrounds.
Shielded from need by the um-
brella of affluence. they need
something to occupy their time.

Why not remake the world.
bring the millennium a little
closer.

The tragedy is that many are
sincere and actually believe that
utopia is’ for this world. Prac-
tical constraints are disregarded
as the Armageddon approaches.
Reality is replaced by a kind
of dream world. .

Kent State was merely a mani-
festation of this state of mind.
Professor John Roche of Bran-
deis says that students also par-
ticipate in such mob actions
look upon it as some sort of
“game.” They can yell all the
obscenities they wish, provoke
as much as they desire, and
threaten to their heart’s content.

But yet when reaction to them‘

sets in, as it must eventually,
they cry and moan about being
repressed. -

Well what the hell do they
expect? When confrontation
after confrontation is provoked.
how can you not expect inci-
dents like Kent State to happen‘?
The real miracle is that more

,’Writing On

by ALLEN DARLING

Does anyone remember the
1 Seven Deadly Sins? Does any-
I «one remember six of them? Well
if you do, forget them. You’ve
been had. Like so many tra-
_ ditions the magnificent seven
"have faded, their relevance lost
'_in the light of nuclear warfare,
the New Left, Alka-Seltzer,
television and Joe Namath. Let’s
‘a face it, Lust is here to stay!

3 This is not to say that having
\°-‘fseven deadly sins is‘neccessar-
ily_a bad idea. All that's needed
-is a little updating, some simple
_ revisions, some new sins to avoid
_at all -costs or to at least shy
“away from come
iDay when Eldridge Cleaver buys
 a- home in Chevy Chase; when
~_Jerry Rubin does it; when a veri-
table host of angles bring the
wrath of evolutionary social
change raining down upon us;
when John Wayne finally starts
‘ to.

THE ‘FIRST deadly sin will
be Ambition, as Ambitious
people are clearly dangerous to
have around. Sloth, on the
other hand, though sometimes
monotonous is generally-harm-
less and should take its rightful

place among man’s pursuits.
Admittedly “a stitch in time
saves nine," but without ambi-

-tion ,we -could just sit around
and sew all day long, so every-
thing should work out.

The Second Deadly Sin will
be Autonomy. Certainly anyone
 wantingTto maintain his individu-

E ality and exercise his rights to
reject insanity, whether its
source be right or left, is most
likely a narc and besides not a
very nice kid.

Judgement ‘

 

In Walden, Thoreau said,
“One can be a majority, if he
is right", but since Buckley feels
the’ seme way we can’t allow
that idea to carry too much
weight. Attempts to achieve or
maintain Autonomy undoubtedly
blaspheme one God or another.

and will - only lead to‘ your
being labeled a heretic and
damned to Hell by everyone

instead of just those that you
outwardly oppose. Repent.
Choose a side.

' Third: “cleanliness is next to
godliness” which like most
cliched sayings has a‘ pleasant
and reassuringly familiar sound.
but doesn‘t mean a hell of a lot.
Reject it out of hand. Anyway.
peoplewith short hair are fas-
cists; people who wear suits.
ties, skirts and dresses (except
for transvestites) are without ex-
ception inexcusable servants of
the system; people whose upper
lip, chin, and/or legs are not
hairy are unconscienible bores
and definitely unhip; people
who are concerned’about bad
breath. body odor of athlete's
foot probably watch “The Fly-
ing Nun" and don‘t play fris-

bee. Cleanliness is phony. Show

your dirt.

I'm convinced that we should
‘hold on to Greed, Avarice and
Envy for a while longer. We
clearly haven‘t progressed too
far in these areas since biblical
times. and that these sins are
gross. ugly. malignant. venom-
ous, and still very much a part
of our lives is undeniable.

Since they are still applicable
to both majority and minority.
core and fringe. and to most peo-
ple regardless of race. creed.

length of hair or place of.na--

tional origin they have earned
their places among the deadly
sins.

Finally we come to Under-
standing. No matter what side
of any argument you find your-
self on beware of it. Understand-
ing brings only tranquility which
in a time of social change should
be avoided.

Outlet Provided For

Student Frustrations

by POHLA SMITH

Students who feel they are
no more than numbers, among
the thousands within the Uni-
should be
glad to know there is an agency
that treats them as individuals
with unique needs and problems.
The University Counseling Cen-
ter at room 205 SU is, in the
words of its director, Dr. Warren
T. Hill, “the only agency here
totally for the purpose of help-
ing individual students."

The counseling center exists
for the purpose‘ of helping stu-

-dents find the solution to, as

Hill explained, “any problem
that alate adolescent would
encounter in the process of be-
coming an adult.” The eight
member staff, consisting of
four professional counselors, is
prepared to discuss vocational,
academic, or personal problems.

Dr. Hill, who has been direc-
tor for the past five years, ex-
pressed pride in his staff as he
enumerated their qualifications.
All of the counselors, Dr. Ro-
bert Gallagher, Dr. Tom Sches-
inger, Dr. Penny Crary, and Hill
have earned their doctorates.
Miss Tedie Fakles, counselor-
librarian, holds two masters de-
grees, one in counseling and
one in library science. The in-

terns. Mr. Moses Slith. Miss
Lawrencella Wright. and Mr.
Nelson Harrison, hold post-

graduate degrees and are in the
process of completing their doc-
torates.

Dr. Hill explained that stu-
dents who come to the center
need not feel embarrassed or
fear being labeled neurotic. At
least 10 percent of the students
here at the University seek guid-
ance at one time or another. The
director further explained that
the majority of those who seek
help are simply normal people
with normal problems. The types
of problems discussed range
from vocational, or achieve-
ment problems to parental or
marital problems.

All efforts are made to help
students feel comfortable at the
counseling center. Pretty secre-
taries help the student relax
immediately by offering him
coffee or tea. Warm colors and
large, comfortable chairslend
the offices an informal. homey.
atmosphere.

Students need not fear that
their confidences will be vio-
lated; all meetings are confi-
dential. Since the counselors

keep no records and take no
notes, as Dr. Crary explained.
no information could possible be
passed on to other agencies. She

added that there is also no dis-
cussion among the staff.

A special feature of the coun-
seling center is its vocational
library. There. students may
find information on various
schools and vocations. The cen-
ter also helps sponsor the annual
career seminar here at the Uni-
versity.

WPGH
Airs For
Charity

by JOYCE SMITH

WPGH sponsored a charity
marathon for the Muscular Dys-
trophy Association. broadcasting
live from McDonalds Restau-
rant at Forbes Ave. and Boquet
St. September 2-9.

Each term for the past two
years. WPGH sponsored a mar-
athon to raise money for differ-
ent charitable organizations. In
the past broadcasting came ‘from
the Towers Lobby. However.
for the last two years McDon-
ald's Restaurant has been the
location. thereason being that
more of the Oakland commun-
ity is reached and therefore
more money can be raised.

The station found that by
giving the marathon at the be-
ginning of the term. especially
in the fall. it gave the disc
jockeys a chance to structure a
rather flexible program and
gives the station a chance to
make the necessary new term
adjustments. When asked about
the marathon and its set up. D.J.
Ronaele Novotny said. “It’s good
and fun to do! "

ennessey Rep laces  

'P0int’ With ‘Forum’

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Tom Hennessey. a one time
general assignment writer with
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,

did not find his work as fulfill-i

ing as he would have liked and
recently decided to ‘change his
line of work. Capitalizing on
the collapse of The Pittsburgh
Point of the radical newspaper.

the former reporter invested in *

its stock and now is the editor
of that newspaper. '

Hen_nessy immediately made
two drastic changes in the paper.
First. he renamed the paper the
Pittsburgh Forum.

The next change Hennessy
undertook was to balance opin-
ion, since the old Point, re-
stricted itself to leftist causes.
Hennessy relates that George
Shanky, a local conservative
who campaigned unsuccessfully
for the Mayoralty, will present
arguments for the conservative
side, and a liberal writer is cur-
rently being sought to present
the other point of view.

Hennessy said that the Forum
will focus upon politics. envir-
inment. and consumer protec-

tion. Like the Point, it will
continue _its coverage-on art and
music and publish a calendar
of community events.

The new editor attributes the
downfall of the Point to two fac-
tors. "The Point was victimized."
Hennessy asserted. “by the in-
flated economy. and. further-
more. it alientate its advertisers.
They were offended by the use
of four—letter words and obscene
photography.“

To enhance its appeal. the
Forum will make use of writers

specializing in given areas. The

paper is searching for contribu-
tors within the Pittsburgh com-
munity. ‘

The Forum will issue its first
publication at the end of Octo-
ber and will publish on a weekly
basis. Mr. Hennessey has ac-
quired the Points list of. sub-
scribers and those whose sub-
scriptions are still in process
will continue to receive weekly
issues. Those whose subscriptions
have expired will each be sent
a sample copy of the new journ-
al at the end of this month.

i"RedliTai)ei Hater’-

  Siporin’s r

by ANNE DORN

Rae Siporin hates red tape.
And so. the new assistant CAS
dean is going to make it her
job "to snkp as much of it as
possible“ for students

Dr..Siporin. who is also an
assistant professor in English.
considers one of her responsi-
bilities "finding out what re-
sources are available here and
making them available to stu-
dents." As assistant dean. she
is dealing with problems of
curriculum. But Dr. Siporin is
also concerned with "pulling
things together“ by cutting
through the bureaucracy of the
Universitys many offices. "1
hate sending students from of-
fice to office."

To this end. she is working
closely with the Advising Cen-
ter. and her office is even lo-
cated on the same floor in 909‘
CL. Many of the problems that
students haveustated Dr. Siporin.
“'are not always academic ones.
I'm trying now to see how the
Advising Center can work more
closely with the Counseling
Center."

Her office will also be work-
ing in the area of advising'"self-
designed majors. Aside from
granting official OK’s and find-
ing faculty sponsors, Dr. Sipor-
in will be doing research in the
type of courses the individual
student would need for a self-
designed degree.

_By talking with “self-design-
ed majors“ Dr. ‘Siporin feels
she may be able to" find out the
type of courses students "really
want" and relate this informa-

tion to her responsibilities with

curriculum. ”

In ‘the field of English. Dr.
Siporin specializes in linguistics.

‘This year. she will be working

with the Trainers of Teacher
Trainers. "a" federally funded‘
program to research new "and
better methods of training
teachers and those who train
teachers. . . I‘d like to get rid
of the notion of teaching gram-
mar and instead emphasize
communication."

Dr. Siporin assumed her posi-‘
tion July 1. She and Dr. Ro-
berta Salper were to work to-
gether as assistant deans. but

.1 ob--°S11ip’    

 

     

Dr. Salper recently left her year
old position for the University

of San Diego as a visiting assist-‘ .\

ant professor. Dr. Siporin gradu-
ated with. a BA from Wayne
State University in Detroit. She
earned her MA and PhD degrees

from UCLA. She has been at ‘ 

the University since the fall of
1968. A ‘

Freshman Council is compris-'
ed of 25 women elected by their
class. The Council is_ concerned
with freshman women. Its unique
nature allows for complete flexi-
bility in its endeavors—it can fol-
low some of the past activities
such as promoting spirit at fresh-
manfootball games. salute to
mentors. city sisters program-
and/or develop new ideas. It is
not bound by the past. It goes in
the direction its members desire.

During the first weeks of Sep-
tember. applications for Fresh-
man Council elections will be
available. Elections will be held
the last week in September.

Another activity of AWS initi-

ated solely for freshman women is '

Sipp didn‘t jump at the oppor-

first came to him. Panther Head
Coach Carl DePasqua and Ath-
letic Director Casimir Myslinski
approached him more than. a
month ago. He didn‘t accept
them because he wasn‘t sure
of the possibility of staying with
the Development Center.. And his
masters thesis -was also due in
two weeks.

. Unfortunately for Sipp, his
acceptance eventually came at a 1
time when Syracuse, one of Pitt’s
opponents, is having difficulty
with its black athletes over the
hiring of a token black. But Sipp
says any connecting of his ap-
pointment with . the Syracuse
trouble doesn’t disturb him.

Not only is Sipp sure that an
incident similar to the oneat
Syracuse wasn't foreseen at Pitt.
he also believesjthat he can be
an important asset to the Panth-

“I think I can lend the en-

Injury Wave, Offense;

Diseourage DePasqua

By BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

Inconsistent play and consistent injuries seem to characterize

Panther football drills.

In the latest scrimmage last Saturday. 17 individuals were hurt-
ing. while the players who were able to perform must have dropped
the ball ‘at least 17 times. The Panthers suffered 7 fumbles and-

dropped innumerable passes.

“We were extremely ragged. It was the worst that we‘ve looked

all year." grunted head coach
Carl DePasqua.

. “It was a good thing it wasn’t
UCLA out there today,” Offen-

. sive Co-ordinator Bimbo Cecconi

muttered.

DePasqua wasn't completely-

discouraged. however. He point-
ed out that many Panthers were
"defense

Despite the defenses robust
rush‘and its overall brisk play.
the offensedrew most of the
post-game attention. “We just
couldn't hold onto anything."
DePasqua mentioned. “That
makes a world of difference in
trying to move the ball. There
just weren't any sustained
drives." '

The number of players start-

, ing at strange positions also con-

tributed to the afternoon’s fias-
co. Offensive tackles Ernie Web-
ster and Bruce Harkiewicz were
switched to guards, while Dan
Lynn remained at guard but

-played on the opposite side of

the center. Fullback John This-
sen, meanwhile, ran from the
halfback slot.

  Cubs l3egiI1 WOPl{Ol1tS
With 4 Quarterbacks
Vying‘For Top Spot

By JERRY MYERS.

Complete with a full squad of ballplayers. Coach Bill Quinter
began working out with the freshman football team last Wednesday.
concentrating on basic fundamentals and tough conditioning drills.

Opening their 1970 season with 42 players. including ten walk-
ons. the Cubs and Coach Quinter are confident of a good year.

According to the coach. "most of the freshmen are really enthu-

siastic about playing. They look

forward to getting out and work-

ing. All the guys we recruited

are pretty fine football players.
' and most of the walk-ons too."

Concentrating on fundamen-
‘g tals. Quinter is interested in
 things like blocking. tackling and
l running.

 "We have a few plays that we
 use every day but we‘re working
 mostly on the basic stuff."11e
 mentioned. ’

f The great majority of players
 are natives of Pennsylvania,
l,__ many of them from the Pittsburgh
.-" area. Four quarterbacks are bat-

..h‘.___.tling for the number one spot,-

-—"’ each getting an equal shot at th
position. '
Bob Medwid. a 6-3. 180 pound-
er from Sto-Rox high school in
McKees Rocks. was the West’s
quarterback in the Pennsylvania
-"Big33‘Classic. ’ ’

Rod Huth. a native of Brack-
enridge, Pa., may prove to be the
real dark-horse candidate. Huth
missed his whole senior year in
high school after getting banged-
up in the first game of that foot-
ball season. Since then he has
recovered completely from the
knee operation he underwent and
according to Quiner, “the opera-
tion doesn't seem‘ to give him

any trouble. We ran times on

Another 6-3 quarterback is
Dan Rullo. He resides in Holis-
opple, Pa., and goes at about 180
pounds. He also plays defensive
halfback and might see some ac-
tion there.

The fourth quarterback pros-
pect, Bob Viellette, is from Ni-
agara Falls, New York, and is
a graduate of Bishop Duffy high
school there. He goes at about
6-0 and also weighs 180 pounds.-

Commenting on the effects of
the quarterbacks practicing with
the varsity, Quinter said, “When
the boys go and _work-out with
the varsity i.t helps them to de-
velope poise. It also gives the
varsity a chance to work with
someone. The quarterbacks then
comeback to the freshmen prac-
tice and he seems to operate
smoother."

The majority of the‘ time the
Cubs will be working out on the
All-Purpose field behind Trees
Hall. Last Saturday they got an
opportunity to sample the Astro-

_ Turf in the stadium.

“The boys adjusted pretty well
to the Astro-turf," Quinter said.
“We practiced there mainly be-
cause all our games this year
will be played on the turf and the
players will have to get used /to ‘
it." i

The Cubs will play four games
this year, three at home in Pitt
stadium and the fourth in Mor-
gantown, West Virginia where
there is also an Astro-Turf grid-
iron.

  What About   That

    Secondary,   M r.

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Just outside the Pitt locker

room. Charlie Hall was leaning

against the bars of the gate that prevent spectators from entering the
field at Pitt Stadium. He was watching most of his Panther team-
mates warming up prior to the Saturday scrimmage he would miss

because of a slight ankle injury.

“I could probably go out there today." he said. “But Doc Smith

told me to take it easy."

Dr. W. K. Smith, the Pitt foot-
ball physician, had better tell
Hall to take it easy. The senior
Panther is the most experienced
member of the Cat defensive
backfield. a secondary which has

been depleted through gradua-~

tion and injury.

Losing starters like Dave Dib-
bley and George Pribish was
enough of a loss. But an eye in-
jury to Mike Bannon three weeks
before opening of fall camp has
made ‘the Pitt secondary an un-
certainty on an experienced Pan-
ther defensive unit. Bannan was
expected to start this year.

Currently Hall and Bryant
Salter are the regular corner-

vidual workouts for the harriers
to give them all a chance to get
into prime condition.

“By now, all of the team is
running anywhere from 18-22
miles a day to get into shape."
he mentioned.

After the initial training
phase, Banner hopes to be able
to pull things together slowly
and get ready for the first duel
meet against Cleveland State on
September 30.

Banner realizes the potential
of the team with cautious opti-
mism.

“We have four or five guys
that could be named All-Ameri-
cans barring injuries or illness-
es,” he said. “Everyone is a tre-
mendous competitor.”

backs. and J. D. Lewis has
switched from a preferred offen-
sive post to join Bill Ramos as
top safetymen‘.

What does Charlie Hall think
about this secondary. knowing
that it is going to face some tal-
ented and tested quarterbacks
this fall? ‘—

“It undoubtedly hurt us alot
when Bannan was injured,” he
said. “But I don’t know if you
can ‘call it a weak spot. We’ve
got some pretty good athletes
out there ‘. . . But we’re gonna
need some work.”

With the ankle problem—plus
a muscle pull before it—Hall
has missed more practice than
he would have preferred. But
he probably needs the work less
than the other members of the
secondary.. -

Hall is a two-year regular at

A .the corner post, and last season
against Oklahoma he had the

A depth crisis ‘could cause
similar occurences this year if
many more injuries hit the de-
fensive backfield. Third-stringer
Craig Kugler is also out for the
season, and Willie Saloky has
been nursing a problem knee.

But Hall could be correct
about the quality of the men De-
Pasqua will use to defend against
the. longer passes. Their leader.
Charlie Hall. was being touted as
an All-America hopeful prior to

Pitt‘s 1970 spring Blue-G_oldA
game.
Now. the Pitt publicity de-

partment is only calling Hall an
All-East candidate, but the cor-
nerback says the change of opin-
ion only bothered him for a
short time.

“I’m not looking towards any-
thing like that,” he said.

Hall is looking towards play-
ing a lot of defensive football

Soccermen Strive To

  Top .500 Record

"With some major handicaps

overcome, coach Leo Bemis is

launching his soccer team on a
campaign to improve last sea-
son’s .500 record.

.The team cleared its first hur-

‘ I 'dle by acquiring a regular prac-

tice field_. For years the team
practiced on Kennard Field, an
expanse of dirt in the center of
Terrace Village. Last season they
moved to an under—sized field be-

 _ hind the stadium.

Now, with the football team

‘I practicing in the stadium, the

booters have inherited the prac-
tice field behind Trees » Hall.

J _ In addition, they will be play-
. ing most of their home games on ‘
’"the new Astro Turf. '

- Bemis will be aided in his

campaign by 15 returning letter-
men, and some talented fresh-
men.

Bemis’s freshmen recruits in-

 ‘clude ‘Fernando Carriquiry and

"*“"‘ Panthers

his cousin, Jorge Maure, two
high school soccer champions
from Lima, Peru. A total of twen-
ty freshmen are on the roster.

The team has scheduled a
practice scrimmage" with Dav-
is Elkins College for Saturday.

Their first regular match will
be: on September 19, at the Uni-
versity of Akron.

Bemis rates Akron as. “Very

tough." “They have an outstand-7

ing team every year,"
ed.

The coach considers Akron,
Cleveland State, «West Chester
and Bucknell, as his .most diffi-
cult opponents.

Bemis seems to have garnered
another fine crop of frosh.

This year's batch boasts five
foreign-born booters who ought
to supplement the predominant-
ly local J. V. team well. The for-
eign-born recruits number four
South Americans and one Italian.

The offense includes Tony Bo-
laa, Pete Bender,’ John Heagy,
Robert Hull, Dennis Kohlmyer,
Jorge Maure (Peru), Bill Rex,
Al Sciulli, Ed Simmonds (Ecua-
dor) and Bill Slemenda, the Cen-
tral Catholic captain and high
scorer.

Among the halfbacks and full-
backs are Fernando Carriquiry
(Peru), Bill Hauch, _Tony Poli-
cicchio (Italy), and August R01-
and (Chile). ‘

‘The goalies are Nate Robbitt,
Bill Haines. and .l,\,_‘/lgarty Willem.

In addition to these fine frosh
the J. V. team will be bolstered
by the experience of the follow-
ing soccer sophomores: George
Eross, Dick Euler, Jorge Gut-
ierrey on offense, with Dennis
Kozak, Len ‘Raffa, Larry Skal-
ski, -and Rick Ulaner at half-
back.

=I= * *

Bemis and his two assistant
coaches, Joe Luxbacher and Ke-

_vin Crowley, need a manager to

take care of the equipment for
both the J. V. and the Varsity.
Anyone interested should con-
tact Bemis at extension 66236,
Monday through Friday,
time before 4:00 p.m., or when

Bttsics Stressed As I
R Cubs Begin Training

 

On All-Purpose Field

(‘Continued from Page 13)

“We havethree weeks before
the game," he said. “We have a
small scrimmage almost every
day between -A the freshman
squadsf‘

The general appearance of the
freshmen football team is a lot
different compared to 1969.
Quinter now has a full team of
players to work with and three
good young coaches to help him
out.

..On the freshmen staff this

year is former varsity lineman
Rod Fedorchak, who got a bid
to play pro ball for the Kansas
City Chiefs. Another Pitt foot-
ball veteran, Bob Ellis will also
be working with the team.

Ellis was a lineman for Pitt
and is now drilling the ends on
the Cub squad. Frank Nespolli,
Quinter’s third assistant, is not
that familiar with coaching.

According the Quinter, “Frank
said he wants to learn about
football and we’re going to help
him as much as we can.”

All the home games will be in
the afternoon, which is a switch
from the past when the Cubs
played in the evening at Forbes
Field. When asked about this
switch in playing times, Quinter
claimed, “We practice football in
the daytime, we play‘ football in
the daytime. The night games
were mainly for the benefit of
the crowds. Of course, when you
play ‘at night you have to make

adjustments that we won’t have
to make this year."

When foundations are being
set for a tradition of top-notch
college football, frosh squads
like the Cubs are one of the bas-
ic ingrediants in the plan.

Cheerleaders 

Managers,

Needed Now

There is more happening on a
football field each Saturday af-
ternoon than players battling
each other, with their coaches’
yelling commentary. Close” to
the sidelines the cheerleaders
add color and spirit to the week-
end classics.

The Pitt cheerleaders are in
need of another male member
or two, and try-outs will be held
on Monday, Sept. 14 at 7' p.m.
in the Trees Hall Gym. It I?)
specifically stressed that only
male members are needed at
this time. _

Closer to the grid scene is the
need of more managers for the
football squad. Anyone interest-
ed in joining the crew of man-
agers should contact Dave Ev-
ans. Dave can be found in Tow-
er B, or at 687-2154. Here is an
opportunity to get right into the
football scene and to give the
Panthers a helping hand. ‘

TRAINERS ARE AN important part of the team in major collegiate football.
The Pitt squad, like most in the nation, is well-equipped with a crew to
take part of everything from bruises to headaches. Above, head trainer
Willie Myers attends to receiver Bill Pilconis after a collision during a scrim-
mage at the Meadville camp two weeks ago.

Assisting Myers are Danny Bazylak (student trainer) and John Spiker.

The Panthers had two other trainers at Meadville. Not shown in the
photo, taken by Paul Salva, are Bobby Mangini (student trainer) and Ro-
ger McGi||. -
