Five Panther varsity teams
which left Pittsburgh Friday
and Saturday -for intercol-
legiate championship events
from South Bend to Lancaster
returned yesterday _with a record of
successes mixed with failures.

Foremost among the successes was
the great showing Billy Jesko and
his mates pu't up during the last half
to defeat West Virginia’s basketball
team, 48-42, on the Morgantown ﬂoor
Saturday night. This victory, follow-
ing the Mountaineers’ defeat of Tem-
ple Wednesday night, gave the Pan-
ther ﬂoormen a much-deserved tie
with Temple in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate basketball conference and
necessitated a playoff game.

Next in importance were the three
Central Intercollegiate track cham-
pionships which Coach Carl Olson’s
runners recorded in the CIC meet
Saturday in South Bend. Johnny
Woodruif, ace half-miler, Art Thomas
in the 440, and the Panther relay
team all ran ﬁrst in their events, al-
though the supporting cast was only
good enough to place the Panthers
fourth in total points.

Swimmers Take Two

Coach Pat Corr’s swimming tea._m,
meanwhile, was running up two in-
dividual championships. and taking
third in an Eastern Collegiate Swim-
ming Assbciation meet at Franklin
and Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa.
Captain Bill “Red” McQuillan ﬁn-
ished his last season for Pitt by re-
gaining his diving title which he won
in 1935, but lost in 1936. And Walt
Nowotny led home the ﬁnalists in the
100-yard free-style race. Tom Locke
narrowly missed winning both the
220- and 440-yard events, and the
freshman 220-yard relay team also
swam second, pushing a fast Rutgers
team to a new eastern record.

Panther boxers, needing a tie or a
victory to win their ﬁrst Eastern
Boxing Conference championship,
dropped a decisive 6-2 match to the
Mountaineer mittmen, as only Ray
Bombe managed to chalk up a Pitt
point. The Panthers won the ﬂy-
weight bout by forfeit, but dropped
all the rest, with even Ralph Caruso
losing a close match.

Two Pitt wrestlers grappled their
way to the ﬁnals in the Interstate
wrestling tournament at Waynesburg,
but both Roofner at 145' pounds and
Kosinski at 155 lost to wrestlers of
Case Institute, Cleveland, in the
ﬁnals.

For Annual I-F Dance
At Bill Penn Hotel

 

 

Glen Gray’s Casa Loma Orchestra
has been deﬁnitely booked to play at
the Interfraternity Ball, in the grand
ballroom of the William Penn Hotel
on Friday, April 9.

Announcement by Ben W. Baskin
C37, chairman of the Interfraternity
Ball, that Glen Gray is to play the
aﬂ’air, climaxes the parade of “big
name” bands which began at the Uni-
versity at the Freshman Dance, and
continued with the Junior Prom and
the Military Ball.

“'l‘here is no reason,” asserted Bas-
kin, “why the University cannot have
dances as good as those which are
supposed to be held at other schools.
Getting Glen Gray for the I-F Ball
is, I believe, a big step in the right
direction.”

Along with the word that Glen
Gray is to play the dance comes the
announcement that the ticket sale
will be strictly limited. Only 600
tickets for the -IF Ball will be sold,
according to the committee in charge.

Pre-sale reservation for tickets will
be distributed to fraternity houses on
Wednesday, and. all reservations,
priced at two dollars each, must be
purchased by fraternity men by
Wednesday, March 24.

Those not taken by fraternity men
by March 24 will be placed on gen-
eral campus sale the next day. All
reservations are to be exchanged for
tickets, for an additional two dollars.
on April 5, 6 and 7.

Commit'tee members for the LF
Ball are to hold a meeting tomorrow
at 2:30 o’clock in Room 821, Cathe-
dral.

Day Assembly; selections from the

g’ With the Flaxen Hair,” and the “Gol-
iliwog’s Cakewalk.” The customary
‘school and University songs will also
lbe played.

Dr. Hovde Comments

On Welfare Problems

By Robert Adams
“Understand your own community
before tackling the world.” That is
the advice which Dr. B. J. Hovde.

‘1.‘5S()(‘l¢'1l0 professor of history and di-
rector of public welfare of the City
of Pittsburgh, gave to students at
i'.*‘riday’s meeting of lntersectarian
Forum.

Speaking on “Public Welfare and
Social Security,” Dr. I-Iovde empha-
sized that the public welfare problem
is a local one, and that a more equi-
table (list1'ibutio11 of the good thing.-
that man and nature produce would
go far toward solving the problem.

With present equipment and re-
sources in this country, declared the
speaker, all persons could be proper-
ly maintained. But until a fair sys-
tem of complete distribution exists,

he contends, exploitation of the poor-
er classes will continue, and will give
rise to more problems of public wel-
fare.

“Most people won’t exploit others
consciously,” stated Dr. Hovde; “they
do it in more subtle ways. Show an
‘economic royalist’ a poor man, and
he is usually willing to aid him. But
we must concentrate on the subtle.
abstract side of exploitation if we are
to cure it.”

' People of a nation, asserted the
speaker, cannot attempt to think of
securing peace until they have estab-
lished peace at home. Real peace
within a nation depends upon peace
between classes of its peoplpe, he
continued. Thus, we must try to keep
peace among classes in our country
if we are to become a force for world

peace.

Sports Again

ATHLETIC teams at the University continue
to chip out remarkable niches in the sports
hall of fame. Over the pastweek-end, Dr. Carl-
son’_s basketball squad, far from the best -cage
aggregation in history, pulled up from behind
to tie the Eastern Intercollegiate league-leading
Temple Owls for the title. In doing this, the
Pitt scrappers whipped a rejuvenated West Vir-
ginia combination which only two days earlier
pushed _-the Panthers into a challenging position
by’. subduing the Philadelphians. Thank you
twice, West Virginia’! Should Temple win the
play-off, the Pitt ﬁve will still go down, substan-
tiating our earlier predictions, as one of the
hardest-driving combinations in Pitt athletics.
Those last-half victories over N otre Dame, West-
minster, Duquesne, and Tech were sufficient to
establish this claim before the season reached
the half-way mark. With the end in sight, it is
highly probable that the 1936-37 squad will ﬁnish

with their characteristic punch and drive.
Meanwhile, up on the Trees Field lot, there’s

rumors that another Monday won’t go past before"

thirty or forty pairs of cleats rip into the soft sod
in preparation for the next fall football cam-
paign. The plans are ordinarily secretive, and
evenmore involved this spring with three gentle-
men of the coaching staff still living pretty much
in the spirit of last month's Mardi Gras season
when their three predecessors picked up a few
stray bag—pipes and donned kilties to join_the
Tartan carnival for an indeﬁnite period oftime.
Just who Dr. Sutherland’s choices to fill those
vacancies will be is still unknown, but We are
hoping for an early unmasking of the three gen-
tlemen in question. _ _ ’

While we are discussing a phase of this Car-
negie Tech new deal, it may be pertinent to take
a squint at an alumnus’ version of the signiﬁcance
of the shuffle. It was while we were out Johns-
town way the other week-end that we heard an
old Tech grad, who traded in his cleats some time
back for a case of insurance policies, say that
this story of Tech returning to small-time foot-
ball “tickled him,” especially when he peeked at
that “giant-killer” 1937 Tech schedule, especially
when Tech is to have one of its largest coaching
staffs in history, especially when he claims that
Tech has its best football material in recent his-
tory, and, more especially, when alumni dues to
the athletic association have been increased by
better than one-third (which he is happy to pay
for a Pitt victory). It looks like prosperity for
the boys on the other side of Panther hollow.

..   ‘Portia’ Repeats

By Irene Long

In Venice, many centuries ago as Mr. Shakespeare
had it, a young lady hamed Portia pleaded and won a
famous case in jurisprudence before a gowned, peri-
wigged magistrate. '

In a packed court room of the City-County Building
the other evening, a young la-dy named Marjorie Han-
son, L37, ably argued and won her clie11t’s case in-
volving quasi-contracts. A triuinvirate, Judge James H.
Gray, City Solicitor John J, Kennedy, and Albert C.
Hirsch, attorney-at—law, judged the case,

The occasion was the moot court trial between the
Legal Eagles, organization of non-fraternity law stu-
dents of which Miss Hanson is president, and Phi Alpha
Delta, law school fraternity of .which Leroy Lewis, L38,
is‘ president.

Counsel for the plaintiff, William Kennedy, L37, and
William Dreher, L37, contended that the defendant had
received_ a beneﬁt by the plaintiff’s forbearance to sue
on a tort action. Counsel for the defendant, Miss Han-
sonand Wi.lliam'Watt Foster, L37, presented a history
of common lawpleadings, having dug up a statute of
1621 -which was similar to the Pennsylvania statute of
limitations of 1713 which had reference to the case
at.-hand:-gr  1 ..  - '

J_udge,s‘.Gray_=, Kennedy, and; lS_I_i1*scl_1'lseenied to enjoy
themselves consi_derably at the trial. --_Altern'ately heck-
ling"-and commending’ the counsel, and often joking,
they, along with other spectators, listened with interest
to the pleas of the prospective shysters. After the
decision in favor of the defendant was returned, each
gave his reasons for his respective judgments. Judge
Gray commended the aspiring attorneys upon their
presentation of the case and the form of their sub-
mitted briefs.

‘Brain Straighteners’
A By Albert» Lasday

_Today, The News introduces a new feature: "Brain
Straighteners.” Many publications have “Brain
Twisters," but now pwe. have “Brain Straighteners."
Each Monday, iintil further noticeH‘(watch-:th'e obitu-‘
ary columns for word of the editor's sudden demise)
we shall offer for your entertainment an intriguing
question. On Wednesdays, the answers will be given.
The first problem appears below:

 

A man and a boy are hired to harvest potatoes. The
first day the boy pulls the tops from the hills and the
man digs up the potatoes. Each working at his full
speed, the .man succeeds in digging up all the hills from
which the boy has pulled the tops. On the second day
each again works at full speed, but the man pulls tops
and the boy digs up the potatoes; at the end of this
day the boy has ‘dug’ .up only half the hills from which
the man has pulled the tops. If the man receives $5.00
per day, what should the boy be paid?

If you find it hard to work out in terms of potatoes,
change the problem to one with a woman and a girl
washing dishes.

The first problems in this series were suggested b
Dr. James S. Taylor, professor of mathematics. y

By Nick Spanos, Co-Author .
Of "Out For the Count," 1936 Cap and Gown Show

“Swing High, Swing Low,” at the Penn is another
one of these pictures chuck full of people who do
screwy things, and then -laugh at themselves. Of course,
it tries to be a little different in that this time the
characters cry once in awhile, and keep a rooster, called
“Butch,” just for the hell of it. The other cl1arac.ter.-
in the story are a girl who won’t marry a millionaire
because she doesn’t know him well enough, and a fel-
low who plays a “mean” trumpet down in Pémaina.
These two meet, go to jail, drink, marry, divorce, and
then make up again,——which puts them back where they
started from. As you can see, it's a very unusual pic-
ture. A very sad one, too, especially when MacMurray
(he’s the fellow) goes to New York and becomes a
dipsomaniac.

When he “takes up” with a loose woman,
he forgets about his little wif.-3 (Carole Lombard) way
back in Panama. Carole, of course, can stand just so
much,—so there is a divorce. She knows she doesn’t
want to divorce Fred and that she really loves him, but
the story must have a divorce. Mac.Murray is all broken
up or down about the divorce. He loses his white tie
and tails, grows a beard, smokes butts, and staggers
around, looking pretty bad and sad, when Chaizley But-
terworth, his bosom pal, sponsors his comeback, In-
cidentally, Fred had been King of 'I.‘rumpeter.s for a
while, but when liquor spouted from the valves of his
trumpet they hired a new trumpeter. 'l‘herc’s no sense.
in my telling you that Fred makes good on his coine-
back, for you can see for yourself at the Penn. But
see it early in the morning when the price is also low.

The Alvin has a double bill which is a real time-
killer if you care for time-killers. Heading the bill is
an English musical with Jessie Matthews. After seeing
it I've decided that the English should stick to stagiiig
coronations and disarmament parties. True, it has
Jessie Matthews, who is well-built, and Gordon and
Revel, who write good songs, but those are deﬁnitely
not enough. Especially when the show is stuck with
two juveniles who can’t even “niake faces.” The humor
is atrocious. To sum it up, Miss Matthews tells each
of the juveniles just what they’re going" to say next
when they propose to her (humor). You see, she's
heard it all before. Perhaps this picture might be
notable for its conception of an American movie aet—r-ess.
She’s got long slinky hair and a fat, Jewisli-looking:
manager with a waggling cigar; she wears the same
outﬁt on two occasions (six months apart); and she
picks up fellows who can’t sing, act or dance, for her
leading men. To be brief, I thought “Head Over Heels
In Love” was lousy. ,

The second feature on the Alvin bill was “The Devil's
Playground.” It's one of those shows where the audi-
ence calls the shots. You can always tell at least 15
minutes before hand what’s going to happen, If you
don't care for surprises and like to see actors on their
way down, you’ll like it. It’s about deep sea divers
and submarines. You ought to know the-rest.

The Stanley’s got a stage show called the Interna-

tional Revue and a picture called “Sea Devils.” I

haven’t'.seen either but I can tell you that even the
aged Mrs. Parry was not greatly entertained by either
one. Of course Mrs. Parry’s verdict may mean one
of two things, both depending on what you think of
Mrs. Parry.

The Fulton continues to Show the smartestepictures
of the year with “On The Avenue.” Even pretty boy
Powell can’t spoil this one, and if you haven’t_al_reac1y
seen it, you should hurry in the direction of Sixth and
Duquesne before it moves on.

Pitt Bits

 

By Ruttencutter

Story of the week is Karl Punzak’s account of a col-
ored Med school janitor who left school very sudclenly
one night Several years ago after being scared “stiff.”
It seems that the janitor was required to punch a time-
clock in certain rooms of the Med school, including a
laboratory where several bodies were being examined.
Ordinarily, the janitor could enter the lab through a
door close to the time—clock, One night, though, the
usual entrance was locked, and the janitor was forced
to walk the entire length of the dissection room to
punch the clock. The roomwas so dark that he failed
to see the projecting foot of a “stiff” lying on one of
the tables. The foot caught on his coat and jerked
the body to the ﬂoor. When the broom-pusher turned
to see what had happened, he never stopped to collect
that week’S pay. Detectives who arrived because the
clock had not been punched, found the stiff on the floor,
and the open door. Possibly they still noticed the draft.

Juvenile Johnny Woodside
Farmed Out For Show.
Scheduled Tuesday

By Irving Bennett
A bombshell was tossed into the

dramatic world Friday, when a prom- V

incnt stage producer nominated John
Woodside, an actor in the Pitt Play-
er.-" show, “Goodbye Again,” as 
choice for Itliett Butler in the movie

production . of “Gone With the
Wind."
Woodside, playing the part of

Theodore iii the. comedy to be pre-
sented next Tuesday and Wednesday
evenings, is a handsome young blond
boy, tall for his age. Carl B. Cass.
director of Pitt Players, commented
on the nomination with approval of
'Wood.side. _ I

"His smile is one of the most win-
ning I have ever seen, and his act-
ing,” Said Cass, ‘‘.displays a polished
technique rare in such a young man.”

There was only one objection, Cass
cleclared: Johnny is too young. He is
only eiglit _vea.i's old. .

Father Teaches Here

Johnny plays the part of the young
son in the Iiaiglit-Allan comedy the
Players will present in the Pittsburgh
Playlio'u’-rt-. His father in the play is
Oscar (i*()()i’.iSi.:?llI, C39.

Johnny’s real father is an instruc-
tor in commercial education in the
Unive1'sit'_\', having come here three
year;-' ;1.;.3‘o from Colorado.’ Eight-
year--old Johnny attends the Falk
Elementary School, and when Dr.
Martin Chwoworsky, principal of the
Falk School, was asked by Director
Cass to name a boy to play the Theo-
dore role in “Goodbye Again,”.- he
-suggested Johnny Woodside.‘

Johnny's most important problem
when he came to his ﬁrst rehearsal
last week was “to ﬁnd out who. my
pop is.” Now he refuses to leave re-

Mrs. Woodside (‘0l‘nt3~‘. with Johnny
to every rehearsal, but unlike mothers
of screen stars, she sits quietly by,
watching her son. I-Ier big job is to
teach John to say “live dollars" and
lower his voice on the "dollars,” but
Johnny insists on raising the live dol-
lars.

The youngster likes acting, al-
though he still insists that he is go-
ing to be a doctor-. He'll probably
go to Pitt, he says. But among the
third-grade youngs-ters of Folk School,
Johnny is the hero, for he is a real

When it comes to preference in
actors, Johnny insists that Shirley
Temple is great. but, boy, Toni l\‘li.\'
is swell, too. He likes westerns and
G-men pictures. He believes that his
talent, which he denies having, is
original. "My'dad and my mother
only go to the shows. They like
Katherine Cornell.” ‘

Mrs. Woodside lauglis at Jolmny’s
enthusiasm, but believes that acting
in “Goodbye Again” is good training.
She thinks that working with people
like lone Williams, C38, who plays
Ann Rogers, the Se('.l'€:tz1l'_\’; Frank
Critchfield, the lead role of -Ken Bi):-
by, and the others in the play, is
helping Johnny.

with a final laugh.

halftime position, and when the sec-

passed, dribbled, and hooped its way
into the scoring front. The Panthers
fell into ‘the lead at 30-29, kept it
even to 34-33, and then, with six n1in-

they wouldn’t be wont any points

Graduate Committee Accepts
Eight Songs,_Requests
More Candidates

KELLY ‘SPOTS’ TUNES

Most of the music of the
coming Cap and Gown produc-
tion will be the work of stu-
dents, it Was indicated today
by an announcement of the

writers whose songs had been ac-
cepted by the graduate club’s music
committee. .

Tunes by the following men are to
be featured: Charles Raugh, Jack
Stephens, Robert Slack, Sidney Roth-
stein, Donald Joy (two), Herbert
Cohen, and Vernon Krahl.

Some other songsare still being
considered by the committee. The
successful composers are to bring a
piano copy and lead sheet to Room
142, Cathedral, today anytime from
2:30 to 3:30 o’clock. Gene Kelly,
dance director, will hear them then
in order that the music may be spot-
ted in the production; .

In addition, all candidates for the
singing chorus must try out today,
3:30 to 4:30 o’clock, or tomorrow.
1:30 to 3:30 o’clock, in Room 2304,
Cathedral. -This choral group is to
be whipped into shape byyTheodore
Finney, director of the Men’s Glee
Club. Absolutely everyone who in-
tends to participate must appear on
these days with his own music.

‘Rehearsal of the cast will take
place" tomorrow, beginning at 3:30
o’clock. The room number will be
announced on the bulletin boards.

The production will run the full

 

 

‘week of May 3 in the Nixon Theater.

Mr. Biddle has as yet made no deﬁ-
nite plans to take the show on the
road, but there is a possibility of such
a trip, he said.

Critics, Praise Dr. Willian‘1s’§
Book‘Of Nature Study, 
‘The Living World’ ,

By Milton G. Lehman - , -C

“The Living World,” a thick, 704-!
page volume, written by the Univer—:
sity’s Dr. Samuel H. Williams, pro-1
fessor of zoology and associate direc-
tor of the University Lake Labora-
tories, "came off the Macmillan Com-
pany’s press‘ last week.

According to cursory reviews by
sritics in the ﬁelds of biology, the text
's the first c_omprehensive work_-de-
cigned to encompass the; entire ﬁeld,
of nature study in a single volume,
.u1d, Say critics, it is extraordinarily
successful. _ ,

According to Dr. Williams, popular
classroom lecturer, speaker, and au-
thority in the ﬁeld of Arthropoda, of
which his specialization is the beetles,
the volumeis designed for teaching;
of a general course in‘ nature study.

In the preface to “The Living
World,” Dr. Williams declares" that
the work has been designed “to fuli
til the requirements of a cultural
course in biology and to serve as a
basic text in nature study, ﬁeld biol-
ogy, and elementary ecology courses’?
Most similar works are encyclopedic
in nature, Dr. Williams declares.

The volume reﬂects the wide ‘ex-
perience of the author, who has made
research expeditions in nearly every
section of the world._ At variance
with the frequent purely scholastic
and theoretical text books, Dr." Wil-
liams’ text contains; references to
what he has seen and studied him-
self. _ - A -

As an authoritative text, the ‘vol-
ume will be accepted. For its fre-
quent lively and highly personal
style, it will be somewhat of a'relief
to students who have been assigned to
read weighty compendiums compiled
by pure scholars. ‘ i i

The text. has been the result of
some 20 years of experience in study
"-md teaching, and ‘several years of
writing. Assisting Dr. Williams in
the preparation of the volume have
‘been Goerge J. Dambach, Lee W.

' Henderson, Jr., and George E. Wal-

lace, _z:raduate a:5sisl.ant.-5 in the De-
partment of Zoology.
