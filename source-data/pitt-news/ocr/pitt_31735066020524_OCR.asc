_This is “the fun class,”_according

the Student Occupational Therapy
Association (SOTA)._ Mower’s is
among the first class of potential
graduates in OT at Pitt; today" an
accreditation committee determines
whether or not the program is quali-
fied to graduate occupational
therapists.

Occupational therapy has often
-been compared to physical therapy,
but the two are fundamentally dif-
ferent, says, Christina Laichak,

The evaluation committee con-
sists of a combination of American

OT Association members and“

American Medical Association

' members, who have been scrutiniz-

ing Pitt's OT program the past three
days, according to QT advisor
Christine Wolfe. “This program is
like many others in that it needs
accreditation,” Wolfe stated.
“Students have to have graduated
from an accredited institution
before they,can take the National
Certiﬁcation Exam, which is offered
‘twice a year — in June and Janu-
ary,” said Wolfe, whose - main

responsibility at Pitt is supervising
field-work sites, where the students
gain practical experience. ,

“The committee is speaking-‘with’
the dean of health-related profes-
sions, Jerome Martin, senior vice
chancellor Stark, and associate
senior vice chancellor Detre from
the medical school,” Wolfe stated.

, “They are evaluating the curriculum

content, the availability of field
work sites — there are about 40 ——
and the sponsorship of the
university.” ' ‘

Wolfe explained that the field
work_has two in-term phases.. Dur-
ing the winter term of the junior
year, the students spend two morn-
ings a week at a psychiatric facility

‘for their practical experience. They

spend two days a weekvat a physical

' dysfunction and pediatric OT clinics

in_t_he fall term of their senior year.
“The committee makes certain these
resources are available to the stu-
dent becuase they’re such an impor-
tant part of their education.”

Limousines ﬁlled with dignitaries

. and vans jammed with more thana

score of secret service agents and
police officers pulled into Schenley
Quad Wednesday in a display of
heightened security unfamiliar to
most Pitt students.

Yesterday, the university played
host to some of the city’s political,
corporate and academic elite as they

A hosted the third HJ. Heinz Distin-

guished Lecture. Guest speaker at
the invitat_ion’s only speech was
Robert G. Mugabe, prime minister
of Zimbabwe. ‘

The Assembly Room in the Wil-
liam Pitt Student Union, where the
speech was given, resounded with
the rhythm of drums, hand claps and
traditional African music.

The lecture was given as part of

H the HJ. Heinz Company’s Founda-

tion Fellowship Program. The Fel-
lowship was founded in l982_with a
$500,000 endowment from the
Heinz _Foundation. The program
invites and provides funds for quali-
fied individuals from Third World
countries to study at Pitt.

The program is sponsored by the
H.J. Heinz Company and adminis-
tered at Pitt by Burkart Holzner,
director of the University-Ccnter for
International Studies.

R. Derek Findlay, a senior vice
president at Heinz,“opened the lec-
ture with a recapitulation of the
goals of the Fellowship.

The organization hopes that by

exposing future leaders to the educa-, _

tional opportunities of a major

learning center they will return to
their nations with a better under-
standing of the U.S. The foundation
also hopes the experience-_ will
improve their chances for successful ,_
development in their home nations.

_ Chancellor Posvar then intro-
duced Mr. Mugabe.

Mugabe lectured extensively on
the economic development of his
nation. Zimbabwe, formerly Rhode-
sia, gained its independence in 1980.
Before that time, Mugabe had spent

~10 years as a political prisoner.

“Heinz and us are newlyweds.
And we are more than that, we have .
had our first child,” said Mugabe in
reference to a trade agreement in
which Zimbabwe will grow -beans
for a Heinz Co. line of baked. beans.

Mugabe went on to talk about the

strength of the ties between his coun- '

try and Heinz as well as his hope that
more U.S. companies will invest in
Zimbabwe.

Mugabe played on‘ his marriage. _ C

analogy by sayihg, “The marriage is '
firm and strong  but I don’t, think
Heinz would beljealous if I began
looking for other brides.” The crowd

‘responded with laughter’ as: Mugabe“ 

continued, “After all, we are poly-
gamous, not monogamous."

The prime minister commented
"on the‘ conditions in southern
Africa. He condemned the South
African. government and their policy
of apartheid. The policy, restricts the
movement and advvacement of
blacks and other non-whites in the
country.

ter in the nation’s first national'elec-
tion in 1980. ‘ .

_ Why would a comfortable local
journalist like Sally Wiggin, the
weekend anchorwoman for Channel
4 “Action News,” sacrifice a well-
earned vacation to do some revolu-
tionary roving in China, a country
that seldom even enters the mind of

' the average Pittsburgher?

“The reason I did it was because of
my Asian St_udies background,” said

Wiggin confidently. “All of a sudden ’
' it just hit me; I had to let Pittsburgh

know about this.”

Asian Studies Club and the Univer-
sity Center for International Studies
staff, she discussed her one-woman
journalism project for “Action
News” in the People’s Republic of
China.

Wiggin stressed how important
she thought it was for the public to

-know the details and lifestyle of a

country that contains one-fourth of
the world’s population. Mao

According to Wiggin, the trip to

‘China in 1982 was totally self-

conceived and arranged. “My col-

there was no local angle to a story on

talks
on China

continued from page two

China. Wiggin took off on her
summer vacation with a one-half
inch VCR in hand and a lot of
ambition.

“Not much coverage is ever given
to China,” claimed Wiggin. “I feel
the 21st century will be the Asian
century; maybe we won’t be around
at that time, but I think Americans
should develop an awareness for the
next generation.”

Wiggin‘s talk at Pitt included five
video excerpts from the shorts she
did in China. Attaining interviews
from the mayor of Wu Han and
average Chinese citizens, who are
still discouraged from speaking too
freely with foreigners, was not as dif-
ficult as she expected. Wiggin credit-
ed this to the fact that she was a local
reporter from Wu Han’s sister city
and that Chinese officials in that
area were very interested in good
relations with Pittsburgh. ' ‘

“Mayor Calaguiri paved the way
for me," she said. “He told the peo-
ple in Wu Han that I was coming  I’

By Ken DlBucd
For The Pitt News

Only residents 21 years or
older are permitted to possess,
consume or transport alcoholic
beverages in the residence halls.

The amount of alcoholic bever-
ages registered per person per
seven-day period cannot exceed
a) 12 cans of beer, or b) one (1)
pint bottle or one (1)375 mi. bot-
tle of liquor or c) one (I) 1.5 liter
bottle of wine.

When Pitt instituted a new
alcohol policy in the dorms last
year, they threw out the first i
‘ pitch on a whole new ball game.

Alcohol   policy

The game that began is between
the desk attendants and the stu-
dents who try to sneak alcohol
up to their rooms. '

A lanky senior from North
Hills said, “The best way to get
cases or quarter barrels, into the
dorms is in a laundry bag; they
never check them. Once, a desk
attendant asked me why my bag
made such a loud bang when I sat
it down to sign in my friend, and
I told her that I used a lot of
starch in my laundry."

Paul, a junior from Stanton
Heights said, “That alcohol pol-
icy is a bunch of bull. I’ve
brought enough beer into the
dotms the past year to open my

leaves in

ing to solidify its’ power by creating
one-party rule in his government.
Presently, a multi-party government
is guaranteed through 1990. Only by
a 100 percent vote for the change
could the system be changed before -
that time.

The prime minister suggested that
it was interference from South

Fitzgerald, prime minister of the
Republic of Ireland and Valery Gis-
card d’Estang, former president of
France.

Following Mugabe, the president
and chief executive officer of the
Heinz Co. spoke to the audience.

In a humorous address, he
encouraged other companies to

own beer distributor." He also
added that the most creative way
he did it was last Halloween
when he entered the dorms

«dressed as the hunchback of

Notre Dame with a case of
Stroh’s taped to his back. His
girlfriend entered as a pregnant
angel with a case strapped to her
stomach.

Jessica Amsdea, a desk attend-
ant at Bruce Hall, said, “Given
the authority that we have, we do
the best we can to control the
amount of alcohol that enters the
dorms.” The attendants must try
to keep alcohol out of the build-
ing without asking everystudent
to empty book bags that the stu-
dent may try to enter the building
with. Stopping students and

. checking their bags for alcohol is

a violation of the students’rights,
unless. the attendant is sure that
there is alcohol in the bag. This

uch desired

would mean putting X-ray
machines in the buildings so that
all bags would be screened.
“Early in the year the desk
attendants are stricter. They usu-
ally question you about every

bag," explained Ted, a senior.‘

from Shaler who is now living off
campus. He also added that early
in the year when you rent carts to
move in with, you can substitute
a keg for that extra pair of socks.

“The desk attendants are get-, '
’ ting a little brighter,” explained

Paul, a senior from Lawrence-
ville. He also said, “When I really
want to have a party, I just pull a
barrel up through the window
with ropes. It hasn't failed me
yet.”

So as the game continues, the
challenge will continue to grow

for students to be more creative.

the dorms.

P Looking for action

It’s already that time of the year. You’ve heard it, _
,-perhaps even felt it. You hear it in movies (“No one is

-featured. movieiin today’s _Show’c'ase)i. Wliyidoes eve‘:  "' '
ryone think Pittsburgh is so boring?

. Perhaps for some Pitt students, the question
should be asked as “Why does everyone think Oak-
‘land is so boring?” And, adfnit it to yourselves, dorm
students, how many times do you actually get out of _
Oakland and see the rest of Pittsburgh?

- It seems that right around the middle of the term, -
with the mid-term crunch and all the pressure it ,
entails, students get restless, depressed and bored
and start complaining about the campus, Oakland

and Pittsburgh itself.

If the movie scene, bar scene, frat scene, party
scene, etc. start getting you down, why not try some-
thing different and not become even more indiffer-
ent toward your regular activities? You can probably
find something. Right across the street from the
Cathedral is the Carnegie Institute. “Yecch,” some
of you are probably saying at this point, but before
you pass judgment on it as being just anotherjdull,
stuffy museum, check it out and you may actually

, ‘find that something interests you there.

For the less intellectual, try grabbinga bus and
just making the rounds about downtown. The shop-
ping, if nothing else, is great down there and a nice
change of pace. Or go take‘ a hike in Schenley Park,
go to the Phipps Conservatory, visit Point Park, try
some of the food in those weird restaurants that line
Oakland and Atwood streets. '

There’s so much to take advantage of in both
Oakland and the rest of the city.’ Don’t spend four

.' years here and only get to‘ know the immediate cam- _
pus. The “O,” Zelda’s, CJ’s, Peter’s, the stadium and
the Cathedral lawn do not a city make. Try some-

thing new.

criticism  

During the last week of Sep-.

tember and the ﬁrst issue of October
The Pitt News staff felt the need to
print derogatory cartoons of the Pitt
football program. The cartoons
depicted footballeplayers as being
brainless bodies who -received spe-
cial favors from the university. The
cartoons also made references that
all football players received cars and
money from the university.
I must begin by saying that these
accusations are untrue, unfair and
unfounded. What The Pitt News has
failed to mention is the fact that the
football‘ program during the past
and present has contributed large
sums of money to the school’s var-

ious libraries and other non-athletic‘

facilities. Football players continu-
ously participate (on free time) in
many charity events, such as visits to
Children’s Hospital and the VA
Hospital, to name a few. The most
important aspect missing from The
Pitt News is the fact -that during the
past three years Pitt football players
have graduated at an 85-90 percent
ratio. Keep in mind that a typical
day for a football player at Pitt is as

follows: class from 9 to 2, meetings .

and - practice from 2:45 to 6:15,
dinner from 6:30 to 7:30, game Sat-
urday and ﬁnally, more films on
Sunday for 3 to 4 hours.

In closing, it is not my intention to
portray football players as academic
all-Americans. However, it should
be made clear that in comparison to
the general student body, ' football
players accomplish an equal amount
if not more than the average student
at’ Pitt. Finally, it should be remem-
bered that the Pitt football program
has brought a vast amount of pres-

tige to this university and will con- '

tinue to do so with the support of the
students, and hopefully the entire
Pitt News staff.

Editing ethics i
questioned

I was absolutely appalled at the
way my last letter had been edited
before it was published (The Pitt
News Sept. 28, 1984). The way you
butchered the paragraph containing
the history of the Democratic Party
was especially disheartening: by
changing a comma into a semicolon,
rendering “the ‘bureaucracies most
responsible for our economic woes"
as “its bureaucracies are most
responsible for our economic woes,”
and ruining my play on words about
the IRS (perhaps you are unfamiliar
with the word “infernal,” and there-
fore thought I had misspelled “inter
nal"), you transformed a logical
argument in rambling nonsense.
Do a bunch of idiots put your
paper together, or are you trying to
ridicule people _who do not share
your liberalism? The next time a let-
ter to The Pitt News editor sounds to
me as if a moron had written it, I'll
remember what you did to mine and
give its author the benefit .of the
doubt '

  Searching
for peace

peace, that is the true peace, between
our fellow man, until _we, as individ-

uals, have committed ourselves ‘to’
finding inner peace, that is the peace

within our very souls and the love
which exists deep in our hearts.
When we as individuals look at our-
selves as we see others, but with love,
not hatred, cruelty or prejudice, then
and only then can we begin to create
a better world. That very love is
going to waste as we too are wasting
our lives away. We must learn to
understand, to define the principles

by which we can help one another,‘

not constantly hurting one another’s
pride. Together‘ and only together
can we build a better world in which
to live. A worldiwe can be proud of,
-a unified world, ONE NATION
UNDER GOD. .
Maybe it's about time we looked
at ourselves to see what we are really
like. Peace can be obtained if men

would only learn to reason justly

and not degrade the morals of oth-
ers, such as the color of one's skin.
Perhaps there is still hope for
humankind, but time is running out.
Take that look at yourselvesfrom
time to time and try and find that

inner peace, that inner most pre-

cious love. For only through under-
standing man's indiffere-nces, with
regard to the basic rights of others,

‘can. we‘ hope‘ to save the world. .

Think about it, for there may not be
a second chance. The world may
soon end. But can we save it in time?

Letters to the Editor

Stand behind our team

I simply cannot believe the nerve
of some of the students, faculty and
The Pitt News staff here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, particularly
the people who are drawing the car-
toons in The Pitt News, writing the
malicious articles and sending off
the coldhearted letters to our very
biased college paper concerning the
Pitt Panther football team. Has
anyone ever seen any of these people
who are writing these slanderous
news pieces? Have you ever won-
dered, as I have, why, if these people
are such experts at the sport of foot-
ball and coaching, they are not out
on the field on Saturday afternoons?
Why aren’t they going through the
practices that keep the football team
at the stadium for up to eight hours’
per day, at the annual camps that
keep them away from everything but
footall for two full weeks and some
odd days, and at the grueling games
every Saturday that literally tear
apart their bodies just to give the Pitt
students some entertainment on a
Saturday afternoon and a sense of

' pride that they attend Pitt as" the

team does now? .

Our football team is working their
butts off for you people and this is
the‘thanks they get? Did you ever
stop to think that maybe if Pitt stu-
dents stood behind their team as the
West Virginia fans do even when
their team is losing, we might also
raise the Panthers’ spirits enough to
have a victorious team. Apparently,
you haven’t! This school is so full of

‘ ‘‘fair-weather fans” I can hardly

stand it. You all cheer when the
Panthers earn a touchdown or make
a good play, but when even the smal-
lest mistake is made, you all just turn

-around and boo them. I’m_sorry, but»

that just doesn't seem right to me.
Real fans do,n’t do that. If you are
going to treat them like that, then
just don't bother going to the game
at all. The Panthers neither need nor
want people like you around. I’ll tell
you what, I surely wouldn’t play
very well if I knew that it was all for
nothing, that the next time I made a
mistake, the “fans” would be booing

all over again. Would you?

' So, how about this? How about if
this Saturday The PittVNews staff,
the little twit who wanted to turn the
stadium into a parking garage and
all of you who booed our Panthers
go against East Carolina? Let the
Panthers, the coaching staff and
those students and family members
who are really dedicated fans judge
you. Let us be in charge of the news-
paper the week after you play and
you tell me what it feels like. Let me
see how great and perfect all of you

‘people really are since. you all seem
to think that you are so wonderful.
I, along with many confirmed

experts of the sport of football, feel '
that the Pitt Panthers have the '
‘ potential to be one of, if not the, best

college teams in the country. I'm not
saying that the sarcasm and belit-

L _ tling of the Panther “fans” is theonly

problem the team has, but if you
would all do your part in raising the
morale of t-he Panthers and let them
know you’re behind them you would
see a marked difference.

Another point must be raised con-
cerning the misinformation spread-
ing over the Pitt campus that our
Panthers are obtuse illiterates that
can hardly walk, let alone talk. If
you people would just take a look
around and notice these guys as peo-

ple rather; than just hulks of flesh,
you wouﬁ realize that most of them
are very‘intelligent and are pursuing

highly inﬂuential positions in all’

fields. I give these guys more credit

than most people. I'll bet that if you ~
.had to spend 8 hours a day practic-

ing at the stadium and 4 to 5 hours a
day in class, very few of you would
have the averages that you are now
holding. .

And if these guys are such good

L for nothing wastes of life, why are

there always people hanging around
them? Because these people want
some of the limelight, they are glory
mongers and low down groupies.
Don't be hypocrites, people -— the

Panthers don't need people like you! “

All in all, what I am trying to say is
that a good many people around this

university had better take a good,‘

hard look at themselves and their
surroundings. There is nothing
worse in my eyes than a hypocrite. If
you'can’t say something good, then
don’t say anything at all.

The perils of sisterly love

By Kelly Caruso
The Pitt News

“I've had it! You two girls
grow worse every day! Fight!
Fight! Fight! That’s'all you two
know how to do!”

My sister Julie and I were sit-
ting at the kitchen table half-
listening to our mother give us
Lecture No. 23, section ll,
entitled, “The Expected Love
and Devotion Two Sisters
Should Have for Each Other.”
This lecture was carefully
selected from a vast library col-
lection that my mom has stored
in that head of hers. I noticed
that the mole on my mom’s cheek

was getting larger and it would ’

probably start growing rings
around it similar to those of the

_ planet Saturn.

As mother rambled on, I

remembered the boxing match _

Julie and I had a while ago. If any
of the female readers but there
have younger sisters, the follow-
ing story may sound too familiar.

I 'had arrived home after my
last lecture, and I was a bit tired

. and slightly distressed after my

slip into the sewer on the corner
of F orbes and Oakland Avenues.

a

I went into my bedroom withthe
sewer gate clamped onto my
foot, and lo and behold, my sister
was illegally using my new pink
shimmer frost lipstick. You are
probably thinking, “Wow, I bet
she flipped out and killed her!"
No, she is unfortunately still
alive; however, she was in a deep
coma for three months after she
was accidentally struck by the
sewer gate that‘ happened to be
on my foot.

After Julie came out of the
‘coma, she did not remember
_what she had done. Mind you, it
wasn't the fact that she had used
my lipstick, but rather that she
had used it without asking me. I
think that’s what caused the
vicious, maniacal sewer gate to
attack Julie, showing absolutely
no mercy. By the way, the sewer
gate is presently serving 2-5 for
assault and battery.

Julie and I get'_along really

great sometimes. In fact, this

past summer we hardly fought,
and it was terrific! Maybe it was
because neither of us were under
any'pressure (school, etc.), so we .
got along-' better. Sometimes
when we fight we say ignorant

- things to each other in the heat of

anger that we later regret.

g   5. A__ 

Maybe if I turn over a new leaf

it will make it easier for Julie to

-_ change  I‘m‘going to do it! I'll
- be patient, understanding and, ,

yes, I will even possess the most -.

important quality, all-sisterly
love. Just the thought makes my
stomach turn. Don't
though, I know I will be a better
person for I will have a positive
outlook on life! (Do you believe
this baloney?) I’ll tell Julie thatl
want to be her best friend as well
as her sister. I will apologize for
the sewer gate incident, for the
fsuperglue on the eyeshadow
applicator” incident (I must
admit it was quite funny), and
even for the intentional drown-
ing of her pink teddy hear.

I look up and see that the kit-- _
chen is now empty. I hear Van ‘

Halen somewhere in the dis-
tance, so Julie must be in our
room. I take a deep breath and
think of exactly what I will say. I
walk in my room and there she is

standing in front of the lighted;

mirror using a shade of lipstick
that looks vaguelyfamiliar to
me. No! It can’t be  but it is!
"What are you doing with my

pink frost lipstick?" I scream,

and so begins the battle.

The Pitt News, Friday, October 5, 19234

Central American discusses US foreign policy

 Bryan Lee
[The Pittﬂews

Henri Favre, visiting Mellon Pro-

'fessor in Latin American studies and ‘

an expert on Mexico and Andean
Eountries, addressed an informal
group this past Wednesday at noon
as part of the history department's
bag lunch lecture series.
 The cultural anthropologist read
aprepared text entitled: “National
Models of Development in Latin
America, A Dead End?" The ma-
terial explained how the imposition
of industrial models (plans for
industrial development) by the post-
colonial governments of Latin
America led‘ to the break-up of the
peasant agrarian life style. The result
of this breakup is that unemploy-
linenti and underemployment in
Latin America now range from 30-
50 percent. In order to survive, these

 

  

people’ must now migrate great dis-
tances just to obtain “precarious
temporary economic activity.”

As an example, Favre said a rural
migrant might work three months at
a mine some 300 kilometers from his
native village and then three months
at a coastal plantation harvesting
crops. The remainder of the year
might be spent in the capital city
“selling in the street.” Although
never there, these people maintain
their ties to their native villages.
Favre explained that rather than
integrating society, as the post-
colonial governments envisioned,

the imposition of industrial models
_‘resulted in the fragmentation of

society and .created a huge class of
migrant workers.
This fragmentation led to the

_development of social movements as

people banded together to cope with
their problems. These Favre
groud ito four classifications.

   

The first  lie call$7‘.fmic_ro-
movements.” lhese gro_'ups.{orm' in
shanty towns andxpafnos in oiderto
achieve a -concrete but limited goal
(i.e., establishment of a waterline or
the building of a health center).
After this goal is achieved, the move-
ment generally subsides or
disintegrates.

The second type he labeled “esca—
pist movements.” These are spiritual
or religious in nature and are often
the combination of Catholicism and
Indian practices. He cited as an

_example the settlement of a “holy
-city" in the Mexican desert by 12,000
people. -.It was founded in the harsh
desert after some claimed seeing a
vision of the Virgin Mary. Favre
likened it to. the famous Fatima
vision. The people organize life
cmonastically and predict the end of
the world soon. He said that bus-
loads of 40-50 people arrive daily to
__s;w_e£ its population.

Don’t be left in the dar!  

The third type Favre calls “Indi-

anist." These’ are ethnic revivalists
who favor the dissolution of present

nation-states and the organization
of society along ethnic lines. He

‘cited a Bolivian Indianist movement

that captured 10 percent of the vote
in a national election.

The fourth, and perhaps most
interesting, is what Favre calls the
“Integrationalist” movements.
These consist of violent revolution-
ary groups such as the ‘Maoist Shin-
ing Path in Peru, the M-16 group in
Colombia, and the successful Sand-

-inistas of Nicaragua.

Favre said that the current world
economic situation is only exasper-
ating Latin America’s problems and
predicted the . growth of “social
weightlessness." More and more of
the people of Latin America have
“no position in society” and this pre-
vents the “redemocratization” of the
region, said Favre. He predicts

growing political instability in the
area. .

Favre warned the military regimes
are not the solution and that revolu-
tionary movements like the Shining
Path of Peru may happen in other
Latin American countries. “We

‘must be ready” to learn from these
developments, Favre said. When
asked if there was danger of insur-

rection in Guatemala Favre said, “lb

was at Chappas [on the Mexican-
Guatemalan border] and I saw no
insurrectionbut the genocide of the
Indians by the army.” He criticized
the military regime in Guatamala for
being “bloody and inefficient.”

In response to the question of how
the Nicaraguan revolution would
affect US. foreign policy in the
region, Favre replied carefully, “I

‘am European, [and] I don’t know
how the United States defines their
policy,” but he felt it to be one of
“maintaining geo—political equili-
brium.” In that respect he said that
Nicaragua was not a threat because
the Sandinista regime is more popu-
list than leftist.

Furthermore, he said that this
equilibrium would not be affected
should the Shining Path take over in
Peru.

“Not only is the Shining Path
anti-America,” said Favre, “but
anti-Soviet and anti-China as well_.”

' When the Shining Path attacked the

U.S. Embassy recently, they also
bombed the headquarters ofthe pro-
Soviet workers’ union and a few
days later sprayed the Chinese Con-
sulate with gunfire. They have great
“human resources,” said Favre, and
despite 2,000 casualties in four years
and over 3,000 injail, the movement
is growing. ' -

Asked if the guerillas profit from
the trade of cocaine, Favre replied
that although the bulk ofthe cocaine
trade is in the hands of “gangsters”,

A there is a “revolutionary tax” on the '

coke trade. It is an important part of
the economy of Latin America, from
the Peruvian plantations where the
coca plants are grown to Colombia
where is is refined into cocaine.

“Three years ago, ‘the income
from cocaine exceeded” that of the
coffee industry in Columbia,” Favre
said. This illicit trade is such an
important part of the economy of
Bolivia that if removed there would
be “nothing left.”

Presidential candidate .

rips, into Reagan

By Bill Nichle
The Pitt News

Counting his campaign organi-
zers, only eight people attended this
presidential candidate’s press con-
ference at the downtown YWCA
yesterday.

The candidate was born 70 years
ago on the Mesabi Range, an iron
refining and steel town in northern
Minnesota. He spent eight years in a
United States prison, because of a
law which was later found unconsti-
tutional. Andhe was a steelworker
and member of the United Steel-
workers of America. He has run in
the last three presidential elections
and is on the ballot in 22 states for
this election year.

He's Gus Hall, the Communist
Party candidate for president of the
United States.

Hall’s campaign slogan contains
only two words, “Defeat Reagan!"

“The reasons are simple," said
Hall. “Reaganhas given the big cor-
porations and banks $750 billion in
tax breaks, and at the same time he
has cut $380 billion from workers’
wages, and cut another $120 billion
out of social security, food stamps,
and child care. ,

Hall believes that the FBI has
been involved for three years in
Labor Secretary Donovan’s cover-
u .
p“Reagan’s administration is the
most corrupt administration in his-
tory," said Hall.

Hall added, “A Pennsylvania
delegate to the ‘Republican National

Presidential candidate  Hall of the Communist Party.

Convention said ‘of Reagan's policy,
‘You get just the whiff of facisrn.’ I
couldn't agree more. Reagan‘s rhe-
toric has created an atmosphere
where the right wing is on the brink
of fascism.”

Hall feels there is only one way to
get the country’s basic _industries,
like steel and machine building,
back on their feet. That is by public
takeover of these industries.

"Big business is interested only in
profits; they put nothing into new

' technology,” said Hall. “Meanwhile

our banks ﬁnance oversea steel
plants."

When asked how the public atti-
tude toward communism has

\ changed over the years, Hall said,

“Back in ‘72 when I ran, there were
alwaysgbig ‘crowds to hear me speak
because people wanted to see a real
live communist up,close. But today
they come to listen seriously,
because the ideas are drawing the
crowds.”

Breaking us in three

 

 

v years. As she puts it, ”...

by Michael Selz

irreconcilable Differences ‘is not a
comedy. Previews for the movie por-
tray it as such. The seemingly prepos-
terous premise of its plot does the
same. ”What a crazy notion," we're
led to exclaim, ”a cute little girl get-
ting a divorce from her parents!”
(Fact is, this special kind of divorce is
legal in at least six states. The only
liberty taken is with the age limit.)
The movie has funny moments to be
sure, but at the heart, it's a dark com-

ment on the state of the American-

family.

The film opens with this landmark _

case coming to court in where else
but that breeding ground of social
progress, Los Angeles. Casey
Brodsky (Drew Barrymore, the little
girl in E.T. and Firestarter), wantsa
divorce from’ her already-divorced
parents so that she can live with the
Hispanic maid/nanny "who acted as
surrogate parent for most of her ten
if I'm not
going to be totally nuts when Igrow
up, I'd better get out of this family
while I still have the chance.”

Jumping off from courtroom tes-
timony, the film is mostly flashbacks,
chronicling the Brodskys’ lives,
together and asunder.

Lucy Van Patten Brodsky (Shelley
Long), picks up Alfred (Ryan O’Neal)
in Harmony, Ind. He is hitchhiking to
his new job as a film teacher at UCLA.
She is driving her fiance's car‘ to L.A.
to be married. Fate swipes intentions
aside and the two fall in love and
marry in four days. In short order,
Alfred gets discovered by a film
mogul, husband and wife become a

- successful screenwriting team, score

a huge artistic and commercial tri-
umph for which Alfred gets all the
kudos, and the marriage falls apart.
’ Lucy goes through many stages in

the film, drawn to perfection by Shel-
ley Long. Shegoes from a Fair Isle
sweatered Chatham College gradu-
ate (at one point, her husband
asserts, ”No one is ever happy in
Pittsburgh.”), to a Hollywood wife, to
a sweat-suited overweight divorcee
on a chocolate Haagen-Daz diet, to
the quintessential bitch-goddess. Her
performance should win her an

‘Academy ‘Award nomination. Her

child-like quality, reminiscent of les-
sica » Lange, evokes both a tough,
treat—me-like-one~of-the-boys deter-
mination and a tremulous fragility.

Alfred becomes a metaphor of the
evils of success. His ballooning ego
strangles off any giving to others,
and the once idealistic professor
swallows ._the casual, empty, Holly-
wood chic with no misgivings.

The story is not just about Holly-
wood. It is about the collapse of fam-
ily ties amid the rush to fulfill oneself.
Labels and titles mean nothing. After
Alfred has bankrupted himself on a
bloated-budget box office disaster, he

whines to his daughter for support,"

proclaiming mightily, ”I’m. your
father.” She retorts, ”No, you're not.
You don't pay child support
anymore.” '

Everyone leans on Casey.‘When she
gets home from visiting her father,
she is grilled by her mother. When
the two Brodskys break up, Casey
has to sit with her mother in the
Volvo wagon near their house, listen-
ing to Lucy punish herself over her
unfaithful husband with lines like
”They dranktheir lovers’ wine out of
glasses I stood in line to buy.”

All this makes Casey grow up very
fast. Maybe this makes her incredible
precocity believable. Her "tone of
voice in the courtroom betrays a
fatigued, bemused irritation with the
foolish ego ballet of her parents. She‘
was the balm for all their friction and

Shelley Long stars in Irreconcilable Differences.

at age ten wants no more of it. Mak-
ing an analogy between herself and a
pet, she says she was there when
needed, forgotten when" not.
Irreconcilable Differences is really very
funny at times, but all the humor is
slightly tragic. During the m‘arriage_’s

waning stages, Lucy complains of ”a
cobweb on my diaphragm." Great
line, but a marriage devoid of sex isn't
funny. Youiwill laugh, but you'll also
think and maybe even cry a little —' it
should not be missed. '

_ by Dolores Rice

I've been waiting to see a good love
story for quite some time now, and
after seeing Michael Gruskoff's pro-
duction of Until September, I will have
to continue waiting. '

The advertisement reads ”only
once in your life will you meet the one
person who changes you .forever.”
Fair enough. But where is the excite-
ment, the heart pounding within
your chest, the welling up of tears in
your eyes? I

It is a love story — that's all. There ,

are ~na other plot diversions aside

from the two lovers, which should

allow for character development and
emotional attachment to the charac-
ters. But no. ‘

.Mo Alexander, portrayed by Karen
Allen (best known for her role as
Marion in Raiders of the Lost Ark), is a

horticulturist from St.-Louis, on a

trip through Europe with a group of
students. While on a layover in Paris,
Mo misses her plane and is stranded

in‘ Paris for almost a month.

Stuck in the chic-est part of Paris

with only a dingy blue jean jacket, a _

blue and white camouflage jumpsuit
and a pair of Adidas ‘sneakers, she
runs into the charming international
banker Xavier de la Perouse (played
by Thierry Lhermitte, one of France's
popular actors). After many charm-

ing cat and ‘mouse scenes, Mo

acquiesces to Xavier's advances des-

pite his marriage, two children and

string of mistresses. The two make a

pact to spend, their time together_
until he returns, to his family and she

returns to St. Louis — until

September.

Together they spend_three glor-.
ious weeks in love, exploring the
French countryside and each other.
They are swept away by their emo-
tions but the real world closes in on
them and decisions must be made.

Mo's stubbornnessjand Xavier's
arrogance meet head on throughout

- the film and the results are funny.

But, because the film is dedicated

-solely tothe two lovers, anything

that happens outside their relation-
ship seems misplaced and unneces-
sary since it does nothing to add to or
advance the film's plot. The scenes
seem thrown in to take up time.

The music complements the scen-_
ery beautifully "and romantically.
Director of photography Philippe
Welt, though a new name among
cinematographers, managed to focus
France softly to capture its splendor
and charm. One need not see the Eif-
fel Tower in the backround to realize
that they were in France.

LIVING IN THE

NEW  

by Darren Hvizdash '-

If you want to experience the mov-
ing, vanguard force in art today, go to
the Pittsurgh Center for the Arts.
Assembled there is a thrilling exhibi-
tion of New Wave art, the main trend
in art today. The exhibition is called
New Attitudes: Paris/New York.

The exhibit represents nine artists:
Remi Blanchard, Louis Jammes,
Herve di Rosa‘ and Samantha
McEwen from Paris; and Dan Fried-4
man, Ann Mag_nuson, Keith Harding,
Kenny Scharf and Tsei Kwong Chi
from New York. They have come
together for the first time to reach
out to the masses and try. to make
them aware of a world that is both

  AVE

dangerous and superficial. They lash
out with sarcasm at high technology

__and our mundane, material-minded '

middle class culture. They also
express a consuming fear of nuclear
annihilation. ‘

.~New Wave art has its origins in

‘New York City. In 1979, a group of

avant—garde artists formed Club 57 in
the basement of an East Village
church. Club 57 soon became_a hang-
out for the undergound art move-

ment where members engaged in.

bizarre skits and parties '(a sort of

‘contemporary Cabaret Voltaire). In

the summer of 1981, the careers of
these New York artists were cata-
pulted to international fame through
a huge exhibition at the gallery P.S. I

with the Pittsburgh - . ,
Symphony . "
classical music
like you’ve never
 heard it before!

Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis is No. 1 in both jazz
and classical music, winning 1983 Grammies in bo_th
categories. He’ll take your breath away when he
.makes his Pittsburgh Symphony debut! '

called New~Yorlc/New Wave. Recently,
they joined the Parisian artists who
share similar artistic views and New
Attitudes came to light.

One aspect that a number of the
Parisian and New York artists share.

is their ecstatic fascination with Q

children's cartoon space aliens and
fantasyland characters. Space aliens
and alternative universe landscapes
grace the works"o‘f Parisians Herve di
Rosa and Louisa Jammes. Particularly
enjoyable are the paintings of Kenny
Scharf, which feature voluminous,
playful,witty fantasy creatures. Each
of the creatures expresses its own
‘spirit and personality. The paintings

. of di Rosa, Jammes and Scharf are

dazzlingly brilliant and solid with the
colors of a Saturday morning televi-
sion cartoon.

The video ”Made for Television’-’

Ann Magnuson viciously slashes the
superficial and hypocritical world of
television. Her understandable cyni-
cism stings game shows, talk shows,
soap operas and co-mmercials. Partic-
ularly good is her attack on religious
shows in which a ghostly Southern
WASP belle begs for money for mis-
sionaries in France and asks pledgers
to call 1-800-666-CASH. She also
spoofs _MTV with a video by ”Nina
Hagadazovich.” ‘

Tsei‘ Kwong Chi relates the cul-
tures of East and West in photo-

graphs portraying ‘him as a visitor
from Red China in Disneyland posing.

with Mickey Mouse and- Donald .. 
Duck. Though the» photographs are --

cold and sterile, there is a definite
aesthetic appeal in the sharp con-
trasts between the austere, serious
visitor from the East and the rather

,silly Disney figure of the West.

The artificial environment/{Post-
Nuclear Installation” by Dan Fried-
man, is a haunting scenario of a
nuclear explosion‘. It is _a room with
everyday objects — fans, a vacuum
cleaner, bicycle parts, boards,_ etc. -
scattered on the floor, suspended

. from the ceiling or hanging on the

walls as if they were being blown
about in the midst of a nuclear attack.

A rotating toy jet and a lonely, eerie « a

buzzing sound complement this chil-
ling, mind-boggling experience. The
effect is heightened by glowing red,
green, orange and blue brought to life
by a black light to simulate a nuclear

‘ flashl Upon stepping into this room,

one is immediately transported to a
new dimension of mental challenge.

The whole exhibition is an enlight-
ening experience that has more mass-
appeal than most modern art. The

Pittsburgh Center for the Arts is I

located on the corners of Fifth and
Shady Avenues in Shadyside. The
exhibition will be running until Oct.
14. '

‘TONIGHT

David Bowie
EMI America

David Bowie is well on his
way to becoming a mega-lounge
act. What earlier in his career

’was touted as a chameleonic

ability to change personas has
evolved into a well-tempered
versality. With his new album,

Tonight, he has shed his dance-
floor skin and opted instead for

as varied an album as any aspir- 4
~ ing vocal stylist could want.

Here's a varied menu for you:
two straight reggae songs (no
creeping artsy embellishments),
a syrupy Beach Boys song with
strings (”God Only Knows”), a
soul tune by the songwriting
team of Leiber-Stoller, circa
1962, five of nine songs by Iggy
Pop and only two by Bowie
alone — the Young Americans-
styled single; ”Blue Jean,” and a
religious, political song about
the Mideast, ”Loving the Alien.”

Any new fans Mr. Bowie won

' with last year's offering can go

EB '84

A The Everly Brothers

Mercury

The sphere of influence in
popular music that can in some
way be traced to the work and
success of the Everly Broth'ers
extends from the obvious —

Simon and Garfunkel’s revival

of ”Wake Up, ‘Little : Susie”
(1957) —— to the elusive —— Mar.-
shall Crenshaw’s vocal stylings
on his debut album-

Now, rock's answer to CPR,

’Dave Edmunds, has revived the
syrupy harmonies and Country-

based laments of the Everlys on

' EB '84, their first studio effort in

more than a decade.
When Edmunds and the
brothers practice their craft —

rockabilly tunes backed by a‘

rock beat but fueled by the ligh-

-ter, twangier guitar lines and

high-pitched vocals —— the
album entertains.

sulking back to their Thompson "

Twins. This record is eclectic
and not particularly commer-
cial, though luminary Tina
Turner joins our hero for a duet
on the title cut. The production
evokes nothing so much as

_Steely Dan's /lja album. Hugh
Padgham produced, Tonight‘

along with Bowie and band-
member Derek Bramble.» Its
sound is crystal clear, with a big,
thick low end —— a very sensual
listening experience.

His voice is at its best here,
both the low buzzing baritone
on ’’God Only Knows” and the
soulful tenor, which still gets
you smiling on ”Blue Jean.” And
the record's variety does not
mean filler — there are good

‘rock songs on this record. -

Tonight hasn't got the crusad-
ing consistency of last year's
exuberant call to the dance
clubs, but Bowiestill does it bet-

ter than most. For Bowie fans I

only.
 JMIICHAEL SELZ

But according to the liner

notes, the Everlys and Edmunds I

"came into the project with their
sights set on experimenting
with today's ”contemporary”
sounds (i.e. synthesizers). Even
the presence of ELO leader Jeff
Lynne is not enough to save the
experiment from- failure.
There seems to be a negative

connotation in calling the sound .
of the Everlys (and by implica- '

THE WILDEST WISH TO
FLY -
Rupert Hine

_Island I

In a time when the mere
utterance of the word ”synthe-
sizer” constitutes profanity to
an increasingly purist musical
ppess, Rupert I-Iine’s latest
album emerges with the power
of one big sonic expletive. A

I-line, not one for the min-
imalist approach to musical tex-
ture, offers The Wildest Wish To
Fly, a full-bodied exploration of
synth excess and technical inge-
nuity  the trademark of I-Iine
the producer and now of Hine
the artist. '

Rhythmic and tuneful, I-line's
latest -is initially slow though
not totally devoid of character.

The album moves much like a

slug on dry pavement until near
the end of the first side when
”Firefly In the Night” serves to
separatethe project from the

boredom of its synthetic peers _
ly Britishvocal ‘

with its extreme

~.--,

part and an easier, more relaxed 
beat. But "just wait until you flip 3, i

this disc over.

Side two gels into an admira- 
ble piece of work characterized ~

by busy musical touches, syn-
thesizer effects and technical

trickery via layered mixes and I

overdubbing, The -lyrics, sup-
plied by Jeanette Obstoj, give
the musical background a poetic
voice, lending a face to the
sturdy musical body I-line
creates. ' '
_ The light—hearted _confes—
sional of ”Living In Sin" and the
passionate statement of ”M_is-
placed Love” ably support the
tightly structured body of the
second side, and the haunting,
elegiacal title track raises The
Wildest Wish To Fly above the
ranks of other synth dominated
projects. On the charge of mu-
sical excess, Rupert I-Iine beats
the rap  this time around.

THE LONGEST ‘DAY
.The Del Fuegos
Slash

Much to the dismay of many a
Beantown native, rock ’n’ roll in
Boston has somehow come to be
synonymous with the techno-
cratic Cars, when in fact, few
Boston bands are saddled by the
stigma of the Cars’ going-
through-the-motions version
of pop music. Locals, and a for-
tunate few others, however,
know that Boston's music scene
has been cultivated and deified
in that truest of all launching

pads —— the garage.

And ..so it is with the_ Del
Fuegos. On this, their debut lp,
the band offers the tangled gui-
-tar lines, tinny drum beats and
raunchy vocals of a neighbor-
hood band that has somehow
magically, mysteriously struck a
nerve in rocl<’s ageless tradition.
Better yet, the De] Fuegos do a
nifty job of mixing up the influ-
ences, making The Longest Day a
musical hodgepodge of youthful
energy. ' .

Although the texture of

country music pervades the
record with its consistently
twangy guitar parts — courtesy
of brothers Danny and Warren
Zanes — the Del Fuegos come
across strongest in the songs
that cast aside fusions for
straight ahead rock 'n’ roll, as on
the album's two finest songs:

”When The News Is On” and

the title track. ~

The only time’ that The Longest
Day runs into trouble, in fact, is
when the band fails to register
any emotional response toward
their favorite subject — youth-
ful romance. ”Bacl<seat
Nothing," for instance, relies
more on wordplay and country
cliches_ than lead singer Danny

, Zanes’ love’-lost predicament.

’This is rarely the case, how-
ever," and most often‘ the Del
Fuegos paint an interesting por-
trait of a topsy-turvy world of
romance. Though occasionally
repetitive in theme, it is the Del
Fuegos’ spirited performance
that more often than not shines
through. ‘

;j ’ LOU REED
Syria Mosque

October f 4, 1984

bylleffrey Sewald

7 I “What becomes ‘a legend most?”

iHow about a few thousand scream-
ing, rock ’n' roll-thirsty Lou Reed
fans, many of whom were young
enough to be Lou Reed's children?
The response last night at the Syria
Mosque was the ultimate compli-
ment to a man whose music has
‘inspired millions but whose sales
barely jettisoned him into the public
spotlight. ‘ -
Reed rocked happily through a
thunderous two—hour set that fea-
tured spirited renditions of his clas-
sics and earthy, rumbling versions of
‘current material from New Sensations.
_ The resounding chords of Reed's
trademark, ”Sweet Jane,” set Reed's
‘rock ’n' roll show in motion, and the
finely honed precision never ceased.
- Supporting Reed were old com-

rades Robert Quine on guitar, whose“

licks squealed with the psychotic
reverbs for which he is known, and
Fernando Saunders on bass, who ably
added the punch to Reed's songs,
especially with the funkier tunes
from the latest album. Fromdrums to

lkeyboards, the band was tight and

Reed is as able-bodied a front man as
you’ll‘see anywhere. A

blue  masl<

In typical Reed style of late, the
show was incredibly stripped down.
Simple lighting and near static per-
formances did not lessen the impact
of ”Walk on ‘the Wild Side,” for
instance. Reed pumped up and elec-
trified the song, displaying his typi-
cally wry .personality. He even
smiled. No kidding. ' I L

Reed himself looked sleek, in great
physical shape. He looked clear-
minded and happy in his black T-shi_rt
and black leather pants. While he did
not speak much withthe audience,
one got the feeling that what.he did
say was more than he would say on
most occasions. He was having fun,
mimicking playfully the slamming
bass licks of Saunders. Lou looked
like a man who is content just to do
what he's doing. A fan to Lou Reed:
What kind of musieare you listening
to these days? Reed: Rock ’n' roll.

About the only disappointment of
the entire show was the hyper-speed,

-..overly rocked-up version of ”Street
Hassle”. The harrowing nature of the
song's lyrics were all but lost in the
garble of electric guitars and key-
boards, a tragedy in the hearts of Lou
Reed loyals. But if Lou Reed was
looking for the coveted rock ’n' roll
fleece, one must conclude from the
madness of the crowd that he's prob-
ably resting comfortably somewhere
sipping Perrier with it draped majes-

tically around his shoulders. LOUREED

It's official. What many people
thought would happen did. The
Pitt women's tennis team
clinched its first winning season
in two years on Wednesday by
defeating Allegheny 8 matches to
l.

The Lady Panthers swept all
six singles matches on the way to
their seventh victory of the year
against only two defeats. "Well,
we clinched a winning season

today, and that is very important

for. us," said a very. surprised

head coach George Dieffenbach.

' _“We didn't think we'd be this far,

but right now what we have to do
is go out in practice and work
hard." ,

_ Playing her customary brand
of dominating tennis, No. 1 sin-
gles player Jodi Levine won eas-
ily in straight sets 6-3, 6-3. “I
played smart today,” Levine said
after the match. “I went for smart
shots and didn't try to kill the
ball like I usually do, and I think
that was the main reason I won."
Levine defeated. Kris Kohl.

The Pitt News

Too bad Ed Emory pursued a
master's degree in physical educa-
tion and administration. Had the
fifth-year coach at East Carolina set
his sights on an M.B.A. with inten-
tions of entering hospital adminis-
tration, he’d be equally adept at
dealing with his American Red
Cross of a football team as coaching
It. ~ '

Orthopedists have been as much a
part of blackboard strategy as the
assistant -coaches. In one practice
two days ago, four players suffered
dislocated fingers, and another,
starting offensive guard Paul Hog-
gard, twisted a knee, which was
operated on yesterday, and is now
out for the season.

. The remaining list for tomorrow's
Pirate vs. Pitt game (kickoff 12:20
p.m.) reads like a hospital admit-
tance directory. Emory's two start-
ing offensive tackles are sidelined.
Jeff Autry pulled a foot ligament last
week, and Tim Dumas, a redshirted

- sophomore, played on a pulled
. hamstring in ECU’s»opener against

Florida State and hasn't played
since. -

'Quarterback Robbie Bartlett,

started that game but strained‘ knee
ligaments three weeks ago, throwing
that position into cloudiness. In the

- game against Central Michigan, de-

fensive tackle Joe Grinage separated
a shoulder and is done for the sea-
son. And just last week, Emory lost
two starting cornerbacks, Kevin

7 Walker (possible broken ankle) and
M Keith Ford (ankle sprain). ‘

“We've got 95 scholarships, 21 are
out for the season, then there are 30
freshmen, and that leaves you with
40,other players,” Emory _said yes-
terday. “It's a devastating situation."

It's been an equally devastating

year in Greenville, N.C., where the-

Pirates are 1-4 after eking out a win

against Georgia Southern two weeks‘

ago. This follows an'.unexpected 8-3
finish last year, during which ECU
lost by a total of 13 points to-Florida
State (47-46), Florida (24-17) and
Miami (12-7)‘while defeating Mis-
souri, among others. _ '
“We lost about 40 players from

‘ last year's team and if we had [offen-

sive guard Terry] Long back,”
Emory said of the Steelers' mam-

moth draft choice, “we might be 4-1. *

We thought we'd be better, even
though we knew we had problems.”

The problems began at quarter-
back, where three candidates vied to

replace two-year starter Kevin

Ingram on the option. Bartlett
started two games, leaving here and
there to give No. 2 Ron Jones and
No. 3 Darrell Speed playing time

while Emory expen'mented.~All have '

been mediocre at best while Speed
has taken over since the Georgia
Southern game.

Both he and Bartlett have
struggled to be above 50 percent

passing efficiency, with Speed's 349

total. yards coming in four games
played. The depleted line ranks have
made for depressing rushing stats, as
fullback Reggie Branch's 297 yards

1

page—l7

leads the team, although tailback
Tony Baker's 5. 1 average per carry is
tops after 48 carries.

Given that Emory graduatedan _
-entire defensive front line and the

unit "injuries already diagnosed,
ECU only surrendered 140 points.
But, as Emory stifﬂy said of his

defense, “Nobody-has emerged as a V

quality player or leader. We're really
struggling right now."

Even the Pirates‘ oil slick, Henry
Williams, is finding a lot of dry
wells. Last season, Williams estab-
lished himself as the nation's top
kick returner, using his 4.25 speed in
the 40 to average 3l.\l yards‘ per
return. This season, however, his
prospects have dwindled.

“No one kicks the ball to him,”

Emory drawled. .“They’re poaching
the ball to the corner, squibbing it.

Becauseno one kicks it down the’

middle, he's picking up garbage here
and garbage there.” .
Little Henry (5-6, I80), as he's
known down South, has. averaged
20.5 per kickoff return in 17 tries. He
also splits time with starting ﬂanker
Ricky Nichols, but will start for the
first time this weekend as Nichols
moves to split end while ECU's No. I
pass receiver, Stefon Adams, moves
to the defensive backfield as rein-
lforcement. Adams has no touch-
downs, but nets nearly 16 yards after
13 receptions. V
Despite the present-day blight
that so resembles Emory's first two
rebuilding years, he refuses to com-
pare his situation with Pitt's.
“I don't think our problems are
similar to Pitt's," Emory said. “They

lost .a tight end, a great, guard, some’ I

running backs ‘and while they
thought they had a great deal of
depth, they don't have it now. We
were never in Pitt's position because
we don't have the experienced foot-
ball players. They came back with"
talent, players that got them there
last year."

In retrospect, Emory heaves a
long sigh, berating himself for some
questionable coaching last season.

“We were a good football team

because we probably played too‘

many five-year players and both
quarterbacks were seniors. We
should have played some younger
players. We thought we'd coach
ghem in the spring and preseason,
ut ..." '

Nonetheless, it was coaching that
partly contributed to ECU's 20th-
place finish in the ﬁnal Associated
Press writer's poll and a 17th-place
ﬁnish in Sports Illustrated.

“This program is better off than

ever before," said Emory, whose_

predecessor was Auburn coach Pat
Dye. “This team is l-4 but the pro-

gram isn't. As long as we stay that ’

way, we should be able to do some
things.” i A

Emory never did emphasize the
conditional, "as long as."

GRID BITS: Head coach Foge
Fazio seems more concerned about
ECU's quarterback's last name than

his performance to date. “Darrell,
Speed, his name alone scares you. '
Overall, East Ca_rolina has great 1,
. team speed. We're lacking a little bit
there. Speed looks like he's put it _

together and Baker ran well against
North Carolina State [last week]?

' Forecasters?

The gridiron gurus are at it again. Maybe they can
improve over last;’week's showing. See page 22.

At this juncture last season, the
Pitt women’s volleyball team was an
impressive 19-2 and had won five of
five tournaments and a tri-match.
Then came time to face some very
stiff competition via three of the top
eight teams in the country -
Purdue, Nebraska and Kentucky.
Pitt lost all three matches, but came
away satisfied at having pushed two
of those teams to ﬁve grueling
games. '

Tonight, the spikers head for the
Tennessee Classic with a 12-1 record
and much less experience in tourna-
ments; they came in third in their
first such outing, but won the Big
East Southern Division tournament
at Seton Hall last weekend. The rea-
son for the late start, according to
head coach Shelton Collier, was to
ensure that the team would peak at

for Tennessee Classic

 

the right time, unlike last season.

Collier believes this weekend
grants the team several important
opportunities. “It's a great oppor-
tunity to have the chance to play and
defeat a Top 10 team, to help our
team improve, and to identify our
strengths and weaknesses in compe-
tition at the national level.”

Pitt meets host Tennessee,.which
is ranked No. 17 in the country, at
7:30 tonight in what Collier expects
to be a “great match.” Pitt-
Tennessee has evolved into an

intense rivalry between two of the.

best teams in this half of the coun-
try." Last season Pitt lost to Tennes-
see 6-l5, ll-15, 15-13, ll-l5.
Nebraska, Pitt’s next opponent at
10 a.m. Saturday, is tabbed seventh
in the nation and is the defending
Big Eight champion. The Corn-
huskers are 8-0 and in first place in
the Mideast-East Region and are
favored to win the tournament,
according to Collier. Pitt lost to
Nebraska at the Purdue Invitational

No. 8 Texas is Pitt’s ﬁnal oppo-

- nent and is the defending Southwest
Conference champ. The two teams
have played twice in Collier's reign.
The most recent was in the 1981
AIAW national championships,
when Texas defeated Pitt and went
on to win the tournament. Pitt ﬁn-
ished ninth in the country that year.
The other time was in l980, when
Pitt won in overtime, l9-l7, at the
Houston Invitational.

“Do we have the capabilities to
beat a Top l0 team?” Collier asked.
“Traditionally, Pitt has had the team
quality to upset a top-caliber team.
This is a new year, and we’ll see how N
we react to the challenge.

' ' “Our middle blockers [Sopho-
more] Sue Hoover and [Senior]
Ulana Kohutiak will really be tested
by these national-caliber middle
blockers, but I am confident they
will both hold their own,” Collier
said.

Collier also noted the team’s
dependence on Cathy Rupp, who is
still adjusting to being the lone setter
after_ sharing the setting duties with
Judy Young. Because Young con-
tracted mononucleosis, Rupp sets
up all the spikes, and the new S-l
offense has only been in effect a little
over a week.

“Cathy is starting to play excellent
and consistently,” Collier said.
“When she’s on, she's as good as any
setter that will be at this tournament.

“The remaining ingredients are
the outside hitters — powerful Pat
Belcher, freshman Louise

0 O’Shaughnessy, spunky Krid Wex-
ell and defensive stalwart Sally Gil-
lespie,” Collier said.

The coach says one of the team’s
goals is to improve the team’s unity

, and performance as well as individ-
ual performance. Another, of

6-1. Gress, however, was not
entirely happy with. her play. “I
just couldn't hit any ground
strokes, couldn't get any
winners.” Gress also lodged a few
complaints about the wind and
an on-court photographer. “The
photographer didn‘t bother me
taking pictures — what got me
was the walking around,“ she
said. “You‘re trying to concen-
trate on the ball and it's just
really distracting. The wind was
another problem. It swoops
down over the hill, and on the
back court by the wall, it's
terrible."

It was win after win for Pitt.
Jenny Leach emerged a 6-2, 3-6,
6-2 winner. “I’m not at all
pleased with the wayl played,"
she said, shaking off the effects of
a midseason ‘slump. “I'm glad I
won, but I have to get it together
on the court. I don’t know what’s
wrong with me this year. ‘Like

today all she hit me were lobs; I '

should have killed that, but I

didn‘t." Stephanie. Nelson ,

rounded out the Lady Panthers
singles sweep with a convincing
6-l, 6-2-victory.

Tennis team dominates foes

The only match the Lady Pan-
thers dropped all day was the
number three doubles, 4-10. In
doubles play, Dieffenbach con-
tinued to juggle his pairings,
teaming in the number three
match Giselle Leonardo and
Judy Khuu. Leonardo felt she
had a mixed day on the court.’
“Parts of. my game were good, I
had good net shots and had alot
of winners that way, but I had
some-serve problems; my serve
wasn't very good at all today,”
Leonardo said.

Khuu didn‘t think she. played
up to par either: “I didn't play as
well as I. wanted to. I haven’t
been feeling well lately and

_couldn’t practice yesterday."

Dieffenbach is looking ahead
to the Big East Championships
later this month in New York.
“What we have to do now is use

"our remaining matches to get

ourselves primed for the Big
East. We had two goals this sea-
son, and we accomplished one of

,them today in getting a winning

season; our other goal was not to
finish last at the Big East. We’re
going afterthat now."

Pitt wins
in O.T. T

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team’s 2-1
overtime victory over Bethany
College was an occasion for
which every’ team hopes. The
exhilaration and strength of the
team was illustrated in their per-
formance on Wednesday.

“It was a big win,” exclaimed
Coach Joe Luxbacher. “They
[Bethany] are a strong team. Up
until Wednesday they had been
undefeated, hdlding a 6-0-1
record. But our guys played with
much intensity, and it was a team
effort that brought us the win."

turned out to be quite eventful.
Pitt’s first goal came from, Rick
Burkholder, with the assist from
Bob Howard. But the goal was
answered by Bethany’s Mike
Ault. After two of the opponent’s

It wasn’t until eight minutes
into the first overtime that the
joint effort between Pitt’s Tom
Foley and Bob Howard put the
Panthers ahead 2-1.

“The pass from Tom was per-

couldn’t have asked for a better

The triumph has boosted their
morale, as well as their desire to
be recognized as a tough compet-

season. If they continue to com-
pete as consistently as they have,

there will be no’ denying them '
such status.

. Gurus still hoping for first Pitt win

It wasn’t too long ago, last
spring to be exact, that a couple
of California grad students con-
ducted a study. This was no ordi-
nary study. It wasn't into the
chemical nature of fruits and
111115. not what effects the
Summer Olympics would have
on Los Angeles as the world des-
cended upon Orange County for
several days in August. Instead,
they studied Sports Illustrated
and its purported cover jinx.
They proved claims advancing
the jinx as inconclusive and
unjustifiable.

Whatever their ﬁndings, how-
ever, something strange hap-
pened in Syracuse’s Carrier
Dome last weekend. The Or-
angemen entertained the
Nebraska Cornhuskers and inex-

The Pitt News, Friday, October 5, 1984

to explain "because the Huskers
came in with a 3-0 record after
crushing Minnesota, Wyoming
and UCLA. Ah, the answer
becomes clearer when consider-
ing that Husker halfback Jeff
Smith appeared on Sports Illus-
trated's cover one week ago
under the heading, “The Big Red
Machine.”

Despite Nebraska's misfor-
tunes of one week back, The Pitt
News ' Gridiron Gurus recovered
some lost respectability of late,
ﬁnishing 23-27 last week. It's not
quite .500, but it is the closest this
group of four has come in recent
weeks. That, of course, excludes

-the Guest Guru, whom we con-

sider an independent ,_ factor.
Since he or she is always different
each week, his or her finishes are

that policy, since he was the first
outside guest this year to top
.500, finishing 6-4.

Then again, we all would have
done much better had Nebraska

- headed the line score. In one fell

swoop, there went five (what we
thought were) easy victories. But
then again, as East Carolina

coach Ed Emory pointed out
recently, how often will we see
Pitt, Alabama, Nebraska and
Southern Cal all lose on the same
weekend. Will anybody admit to
considering the Panthers in the
same class of teams just
mentioned? '

In any case, the Trojans only

plicably came away with a 17-9
victory. In one sense. that’s hard
