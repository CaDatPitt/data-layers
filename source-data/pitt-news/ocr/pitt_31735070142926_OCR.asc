Swine flu comes to campus

Pitt details its plan to help sick students after the flTSt cases emerge; cases decrease at neighboring Carnegie Mellon

Staff Report

The swine ﬂu has come to campus.
Jay Frerotte, Pitt’s director of en-
vironmental health and safety, said
the University learned of its ﬁrst case
of suspected swine ﬂu, also known as

the H1N1 virus, this past Thursday.

Since then, Pitt has received re-
ports 0 “a few” more cases. Frerotte
declined to say speciﬁcally how many
people on campus might have the
swine ﬂu, noting that since this isn’t
the middle of ﬂu season, almost
anyone with a ﬂu-like sickness is
considered a possible case of the
swine ﬂu. .— '

News of the swine ﬂu on Pitt’s.

campus comes one week after a Uni-
versity of Nebraska-Omaha student
died of possible complications from
H1N1, making her one of the first
college students in the nation to do
so. (See Deaths p. 4.) V

i It also comes the same day Carn-

egie Mellon announced that it’s see— b

ing a decrease in cases.

Over the past three weeks, more
than 200 Carnegie Mellon students
have exhibited ﬂu-like symptoms,
with only a portion of them being
tested for the swine ﬂu.

Today, less than 60 are still re-
covering, Anita Barkin, the school’s
director of student health services,

said in an e-mail to students.
Frerotte said most of the cases
at Pitt have been mild. He suggested
that students with ﬂu-like symptoms
—— which include fever, cough, sore
throat, fatigue, aches and, occasion-
ally, vomiting or diarrhea —— call ei-
ther Student Health Service or the
University’s 24-hour H1N1 hotline.

Pittto promote democracy abroad

Julie Percha
Contributing Editor

How much does it cost to help develop
political parties around the world? For one
Pitt professor, $685,000 sounds about
right.

That’s the amount political science pro-
fessor Scott Morgenstern and his team of
researchers recently received as part of
a grant sponsored by the United States
Agency for International Development,
in collaboration with Higher Education
for Development.

Established in 1961, USAID is a nonpar-
tisan federal agency aimed at expanding
democracy and international development
through humanitarian and crisis response,
global health programs, education initia-
tives and other focus areas.

Shally Prasad, a USAID democracy and

governance officer, said Morgenstern’s
grant is the first of its kind —— and long
overdue. _ - 5
“We have provided assistance in the
area of political parties for over 20 years,
and to date, we've never really done a seri-
ous look at this sector,” she said. L

Pitt brainstorms response

CM U offers an on-campus facility for H1N1-aﬁiicted students

.Flu<1

Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey said in an e—mail to students
yesterday that people who call the
hotline will be put in touch with a
health care provider. If they have
mild symptoms, they will be told
to get rest, drink lots of ﬂuids, take
pain relievers, take fever reducers
and s'elf-isolate.

Students with ﬂu-like symptoms
shouldn’t attend class or social events,
Frerotte said, and sick students with-
in reasonable driving distance‘ should
return to their homes. Sick students
who can’t travel home are advised to
stay in their apartments or dorms.

Frerotte said a resident director
or student health worker will call to
check on sick students who are living
on campus each day. The University
will also arrange to have food sent
to students in dorms, so they don’t
havetoleave isolation. The University
recommends that students living off
campus designate a friend to help
them, should they get the swine ﬂu.

Frerotte said students with ﬂu-
like symptoms should leave their
rooms for necessities and medical

_ care, butthey shouldweartl1e masks

that Pitt provides. ’

Carnegie Mellon University places
students with ﬂu-like symptoms in an
on—campus facility with round—the-
clock nurses. . .

Frerotte said an on—campus fa-
cility is not part of the plan for Pitt
yet.

He said a team of University ofﬁ-
cials — made of representatives from
Environmental Health and Safety,
Student Health Service, Student Af-
fairs and other organizations — has
been meeting regularly since May to
develop a basic plan for dealingwith
the swine ﬂu.

“There’s notasingle  magic fac-
tor that says if we get to Point X, we
will suspend classes,” Frerotte said.
“There are a number of consider-
ations to be taken into‘ accoun ”

He said the University’s swine
ﬂu team will consider the severity
of a swine ﬂu symptoms, numbers
of cases and people’s reactions
when deciding whether it needs to
takeﬁirther action torespond to the
pandemic.

Humphrey said the taskforcewill

Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and advice from the county
health department, Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health and doctors
at UPMC. '

Frerotte said the University will
update students if the swine ﬂu be-
comes more severe or if the number
of cases increases.

Most people who get the swine
ﬂu don’t need to take antiviral medi-
cines, Frerotte said. The exceptions

‘would be pregnant women, people

with high-risk medical conditions,
such as asthma, or critically ill peo-
ple. They should take Tamiﬂu or a
similar drug. . ‘ -

He previously said he expects a
swine ﬂu vaccine to be available by
mid—October. College students willbe
among the ﬁrst to receive the shots.

People ages 65 or older were ex-
posed to a strain of the ﬂu that was
similar to H1N1 between 30 and 50
years ago, giving them some resis-
tanceto it. _ .

Because college-age students
don’t have this resistance, they’re
given a higher priority on the list of
vaccinerecipients.

Students in overflow housing ake best of their situation

Lounges < 1

It’s not a question of ‘if.’ It’s a question
of ‘when.”’

Estefanos said his room isn’t like the
others on campus.

“There’s really no room for a desk and
chair,” he said. “Once I have to study, I’ll
have to make the commute to the library
— and it’s a long commute.”

Estefanos said he was frustrated be-
cause he has an extra key to get in his room,
while other students can use their cards.

“It’s just another thing to lose,” he
said.

A trip up and down Lothrop’s stairs
shows that 11 out of 13 common areas are
now filled with three to four students per
room.

Another freshman, Steve Schmitz, said
he learned last night that he had to move
today.

“I didn’t even get chance to make my
bed yet,” he said.

Originally in Litchﬁeld Tower B, Schmitz
was placed in an overﬂow room in Lothrop
because of an unrelated issue. Today, he’s
moving into Tower C.

James Earle, a spokesman for the Uni-

versity, said it’s typical for the year to begin

with students living in lounges.
“Students have indicated that living on

campus is_ a wonderful experience, and as
such, our demand for housing is high,”
Earle said in an e-mail. “We are thrilled
that so many students wish to live on cam-
pus.”

Earle said additional accommodations
will open up as students move out, and that
students who currently live in the lounges
will eventually be able to move into a per-
manent room. Most of the students living
in lounges will move out within the first
few weeks of the semester, he said.

He added that the University gives first
preference to the students who turned in
their housing contracts the earliest.

Earle also said the order for addition-
al desks —— a common complaint among
residents of the overﬂow rooms — was
delayed, but the desks should arrive next
week. _

“In the meantime, we attempted to
leave the lounge study tables and chairs
in place so that students would have a place
to work,” he said.

Thomas Sevacko, one of Estefanos’ three
roommates, said he was disappointed that
he doesn’t have his own sink, like other
Lothrop residents.

Still, he remains optimistic about his
living situation.

Fedel Estefanos works in his temporary Lothrop room, converted from a lounge.

“It’s not bad,” Sevacko said. “It’s actu-
ally pretty pleasant, pretty homey.”

Sevacko said he and his roommates
spend most of their time in the room —
almost 10 hours per day. He said he and
his roommates have already forged a close
bond, sharing meals and socializing.

David Haselton, who shares a room
with Sevacko and Estefano, said it’s fairly

They never knew what it was like to live
in a traditional dorm and “ignorance is
bliss,” he said.

Sevacko said he’s even enjoying the
experience.

“Really, I love the floor, I love my room-

like being here. This place is all right.” ‘

Researchers to aid parties

USAID ( 2

Prasad said the grant research will help
future USAID initiatives by evaluating a
country’s readiness for party—building and
expanding the framework of its existing
parties.

Over the next two years, Morgenstern
and his team will take a series of two- to
three—week trips to Latin America, where
they will work with USAID workers, U.S.
embassy officials and local political party
representatives. The group will visit seven

to 12 developing nations throughout Asia,
Eastern Europe and Latin America, Mor-
genstern said. Colombia and Peru are two
options they’re considering.

“I’d love to go to as many as I can, but
there’s just not enough time,” Morgen-
stern said with a laugh. “We need to take
advantage of the regional expertise of our
team members.”

Morgenstern said he’s “very excited
about this grant because I was able to

blend my academic interests with prac-
tical applications. I’ve studied [political
parties] for a long time from an academic
standpoint. Now, we can look at them
practically and develop the kind of pro-
grams that would help solidify these in-
stitutions.”

While abroad, Morgenstern and his
team will concentrate on researching
democracy and governance issues, par-
ticularly, USAID’s efforts to develop po-
litical parties as a means of furthering
democracy abroad. ‘»

Prasad said Morgernstern’s work is
“going to be groundbreaking for our team,
for ouroffice and for the University of
Pittsburgh team, as well.”

Still, Morgenstern won’t be able to
come up with one theory that’s best for
every country. With different countries
come varying political climates, and these
need to be considered, he said.

“A big part of what we’re trying to do
is assess the needs of the parties to think
about what kinds of programs are most
effective,” Morgenstern said.

The obstacles to political party devel-
opment vary by country. They include
minority nonrepresentation, religion-
based parties and candidates associated
with certain ethnic or regional groups
rather than with their political identi-
ties, he said.

By evaluating USAID’s existing party-
building programs, Morgenstern and his
research team will develop a framework
that will help future programs account
for the needs of political parties under
different political contexts.

“[USAID is] mostly interested in look-
ing forward. They want to know how to
improve programming for the future,”
he said.

Morgenstern said he applied for the
grant in October of 2008, after he received
a request for applications. Morgenstern
then assembled a team of researchers,
which included Pitt political science pro-
fessors, non—University academics and a
contractor with USAID experience.

While Morgenstern’s expertise is in
Latin American politics, he said the team
also features specialists in African and
Eastern European politics.

“It’s a team that has international ex-
perience in many of the regions of the

world,” Morgenstern said. “It’s a perfect

kind of blend.”

Prasad said she is looking forward to a
productive partnership with Morgenstern
and hisresearch.

“It stands to make a very high impact
on the sector, and we look forward to
that,” she said. “Our expectations for the
team are great.” _

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to the
column in the Welcome Back edi-
tion titled, “Attention SGB: Capital-
ize on your inﬂuence, for once” by
Jacob Brown.

Brown described the United
States Student Association as an
“ancillary organization  that
serves no direct beneﬁt to the
students here at Pitt.” Yet, USSA
Pitt Chapter is a certiﬁed student
organization that directly beneﬁts
Pitt students by educating them on
national political issues and gives

them an opportunity to lobby local ‘

and national officials.

Brown recommended an ex—'

pansion of the SafeRider transpor-
tation program. Having worked
with SafeRider in the past, I can
tell you that talks of repair and ex-
pansion of SafeRider have been in
the works for years now. But the
cost of the upgrade would be about
$180,000. In this economy, Pitt
students sure do not want to see
an increase to the transportation
fee on their bills.

As for the intercollegiate col-
laboration Brown was encourag-
ing to form, the Pittsburgh In-
tercollegiate Council has been in

the works since fall of last year,
although Pitt’s SGB has not joined
yet because of lingering questions
on the management of the organi-
zation. Hopefully, Pitt’s SGB will
consider the opportunity to affect
local politics through this organi-
zation in the future.

Lastly, in regards to the “mean-
ingless rally cry” of “Students
First,” the former president of SGB
and former board members are
responsible for the fall break that
we will be enjoying on Oct. 12, as
well as contributing to the Outside,
the Classroom Curriculum and Pitt
Make a Difference Day.’ I I

The fall break allows many
students not from Pittsburgh to
visit their families mid-semester.
The OCC provides students who
complete the program an edge
over competitors in the job mar-
ket, and Pitt Make a Difference
Day allows students to improve
the Pittsburgh community on a
large scale. If Brown thinks that

these program-s don’t help the stu-

dent body in some way, shape or
form, then yes, it is a meaningless
rally cry.

Tighter security worth it

lebrity than credibility. Numerous
incidents of racial proﬁling involving
South Asians in America go unno-
ticed even though they are clearly
more heinous than what happened
to Khan. .

During July of this year, Ravi
Shankar, an" associate professor at
Central Connecticut State University
and person of SouthAsian origin,was
stopped by New York City police on
suspicion of driving under the inﬂu-
ence. Despite passing two sobriety
tests, Shankarwas arrested and jailed
formore than 36 hours.

’ Before being taken in by police, he
wastold that awarrantwas outforhis
arrest. Upon examining the warrant,
Shankar saw that it was for a white
man who wasn’t his same height,
weight or age. Although Shankar
was ultimately released and cleared
of charges, this is aclear case ofwhat
he calls “Driving while brown.”

With the exception of an interview
with NPR, this story has received little
press —— the most popular article on
the subject was written by Shankar
himself.

As a person of South Asian de-
scent, I’m troubled that dramatized

stories of celebrity detention can gar-
ner more attention than inexcusable
treatment at the hands of those who
we trust to protect our cities. Sure,
Khan’s ordeal is farfrom amusing, but
it shouldn’t become such a grandiose
international news story when there
is such little substance to it.

Every article I’ve read about Khan
and the Newark airport has made



 

Personally, I am willing to
* put up with tighter security
and small inconveniences 

mention of his status as Bollywood’s
premier actor, but mentions little of
the incident itself. Without his ce-
lebrity, no one would know or care
about episodes like Khan’s. I know
this because nearly every time my
family goes through airport securi-
ty, we’re delayed because of similar
screenings.

Regardless of whether it’s because

Thuppal < 9

of my parents’ accents or that one

of our names matched one in the 0

database of suspected terrorists, we
leave our security checks hindered
but unscathed. '

Personally, I am willing to put up with

- tighter security and small inconve-

niences if such practices help to en-

sure the safety of the greater public.

However; I will not excuse treatment
likethat experienced by Shankar. Nor
will I pay any heed to the whining of
pampered princes like Khan.

Some will say that the involve-
ment of celebrities like Khan will
bring more attention to the troubles
of South Asians and all people of
color in the U.S. being treated less
than fairly. I disagree.

When we only pay attention to
such issues because of the celebrity
of people involved, we forget why
these issues should trouble us in the
ﬁrst place.

It shouldn’t be because someone
of such credentials is subjected to the
same processes as common individu-
als. It should be because people are
unjustly, unreasonably discriminated
against. v

Say ‘Yes’ to one of Pittsburgh’s hottest rappers“

movie music video at Altar Bar



Alan Lee, or Mr. International, as he is known to the rap community, will premiere newest

Jocelyn Meehan
For The Pitt News

“Yes Girl” movie music video pre-
miere V

Altar Bar

Thursday, Sept. 3

7 p.m.

$6 general admission, $25 VIP

Ages 21 and older

Sometimes spitting sick rhymes
isn’t enough.

When he’s not rapping, Pitts-
burgh native Alan Lee is busy man-
aging models, actors and mixed
martial arts ﬁghters. '

- But Mr. International, as Lee is
known in the rap world, runs his
ownﬁlm company with the attitude
and resilience of Ari Gold, making
many people want to “hug it out,
b*tch,” as Gold puts it on the HBO
show “Entourage.”

— Lee’s new music video, “Yes Girl,”
will make its debut tomorrow night,
and it would be no surprise for him
to feel overwhelmed, but that’s not

the case. In fact, he feels like he’s
lacking something — time.

“I never have enough time,” Lee-

said. “I stay really organized with
journals and my computer, but I just
wish I had more time in the day.”

Lee also said that he reads a lot
and doesn’t let anyone tell him that
he can’t do something, an attitude
he applied to ﬁnishing his newest
movie music video.

“Yes Girl” is a movie music video
about a modern-day Bonnie and
Clyde and is based on a song Lee
wrote. Directed by Dustin Dowling
with M] Meehan as the cinematog-
rapher, “Yes Girl” willpremiere at
Altar Bar at a Hollywood-esque
event that will include a red carpet
and quite the party.

_“People should expect a few live
performances, the premiere, some
local stars coming out and a lot of
dancing,” Lee said.

DJ Stylz, DJ Magic Mike and The
Pittsburgh Kid will provide the mu-
sic. Lee said that he, as Mr. Inter-
national, Pheni and Choze will do
special performances.

“Yes Girl” is backed by a clever
promotional website — www.yes-
girlmovie.com. The site functions
much in the same manner that ﬁlms
such as “Cloverﬁeld” and “District
9” promoted their movies online,

My dear freshmen, by now you
are cozily nestled into your pic-
shaped slices of collegiate heaven.
You’ve hung band posters on your
walls and put extra-long sheets on
your beds. You’ve had your ﬁrst
weekend of parent-less freedom.
You’re meagerly attempting to
accept the fact that yes, you do
have to take classes for the next
four years.

A lot of lessons in college must"

be learned the hard way. Me tell-
ing you not to take shots of Bac-
ardi 151 after eating nothing but

head in the toilet (once you’re 21,
of course).

What I can help you with, dear
freshmen, is guiding you away
from a few sartorial blunders
—— freshman fashion faux pas,
if you will. I’ve made quite a few
ensemble errors myself over the
years, and hopefully I can assist
you by learning from the pain of
my mistakes.

The following is a list of sug-
gestions, far from all encompass-
ing, but a few thoughts to keep
in mind before you head out the
door in something less than fash-
ionable:

1. ) Ugg boots. Let’s talk about

but they’re comfy as hell, and in
the dead of winter, there’s nothing
better to slip on. The key word,
however, is “winter.” As in, winter
is the only acceptable season to
wear them. When it’s 75 degrees
outside, pairing them with a den-
im miniskirt is not ok.

2.) Crocs, on the other hand,
are completely unacceptable. Al-
ways and forever.

3.) While we’re still on the shoe
topic, lets talk ﬂip—ﬂops: I don’t
particularly care for them in gen-
eral, but I get it .——- they’re com-
fortable. But just as Uggs are for
winter, ﬂip—ﬂops are for summer,
so don’t wear them in the middle

of warning — Oakland sidewalks
get very slippery when it rains.
Run to class with caution. ‘

4.) Those free, baggy T-shirts
you picked up at the Activities
Fair? Save them for the gym and
bed.

5.) The same thing goes for
sweatpants and sneakers. I nev-
er schedule classes before noon,
but I can empathize with those
poor souls taking 8 a.m. chem-
istry labs.

However, waking up early is not
an excuse to look like you’re still in
bed. It doesn’t take any longer to
put onjeans and a sweater.

6.) Put your ID in your pock-

look like they are at a leadership
conference.

z) Here’s one your mothergj;
will thank me for: Girls, when
you’re making a mad dash for a
frat house in the middle of Febru-
ary, put a coat on over your tank
top.

Find one you don’t care all that
much about and use it. Runniri§-
around in single-digit tempera-
tures without a jacket is ridicu-
lous.

8.) If you can’t walk in 4-inch
heels, don’t wear 4-inch heels.
People will make fun of your limpg,
ing and even more so when you
face-plant. Get some nice ﬂats.

Just a mediocre Passage

Maserati ’s instrumental jam album never really accelerates

Lukas Truckenbrod
Staff Writer

Maserati

Passages

Label: Temporary Residence Ltd.

Rocks Like: U2, Mew, Explosions in the Sky
Grade: B-

If Bono was kicked out of U2 and the Edge
was given ﬁill reign,'this might be the result
(also, perhaps if David Gilmour was behind
the board and there was a constant supply of
psychedelic drugs)-.

After a chorus of repeating chants, the
drums and ethereal melodies swell ‘into a
heavy groove. Delay-laden guitars, big open
drums and a fat, edgy bass drive this sound,
which is appropriate when taking the band’s
name into account.

Critics seem to group this album into the
“tum—up-really-loud-and-drive-really—fast—at—
night-in-your-Italian-sportscar” genre.

The ﬁfth track, “The World Outside (Thee
Loving Hand Remix),” starts off as a tl1ree—
song remixed set, all of which contain more
of a dance vibe —— it’s a hypno-psychedelic
trance that might very well translate into

a spectacular live show, not unlike popular
dance-rock band Lotus.

Instrumental music cannot rely on vocals
to keep the listener hooked — instead, Mase-
rati relies on driving rhythms that can turn
into a repetitive drone.

The album can be used most effectively,
and unfortunately, as a basic enhancement
of the mood.

It’s hard to see a story with the lack of L

dynamics throughout the album, but when
listened to individually, the tracks make-for
excellent spots on long road trips and dance
mixtapes. .

One criminally bland CD

Uneven quality and confusing lyrics plague Mallman’s latest

Sarah Simkin
Staff Writer
Mark Mailman
Invincible Criminal
Label: Badman 4
Rocks Like: Billyjoel meets The Killers, but
poorly executed -
Grade: B-

Listeners looking for ’7os~style keyboard
slides and incoherent despondency in their

4 music will conclude that Invincible Criminal

is an album worth listening to. If you don’t
ﬁnd yourself in that category, you might still
enjoy some of Mark Mallman’s compositions
on his second solo album, but don’t expect a
happy mood when you’re done. The instru-
mentals aren’t excessively dark or moody, but
coupled with lyrics bemoaning the passing
of better times, the end result is far from
cheery.

“You’re Never Alone in New York” be— ‘

comes repetitive but compensates with inven-
tive and unusual melodies. “Mercy Calls” is
an overdone ballad featuring inscrutably dra-
matic lyrics including, “It began with mercy
/ And mercy is how it will end / When mercy
calls / We all know who’s answering.”

“In These Times of Harsh Economy” is

comprised exclusively of what-is-he-talking-
about lyrics like, “Some people say whep
Dillenger died / Thatgthe job was inside /31
feel the same about love and war,” and three
or four notes on a keyboard. A little Google
research revealed a quote by Mallman claim-
ing that Invincible Criminal is intended to be
an anthropomorphism of time.

This is clariﬁed by the title track — 
though it’s distracted by out—of—place techno
effects and furious vocals ——- and thoughga
close listening of the album as a whole sup-
ports the grandiose claim, it doesn’t pull it off
to the degree that Mallman and the listener
would hope.

need to do now is ﬁgure out what I’m going to
wear,” Alyse Carpenter, a junior at Point Park
University, said.

Lee is also excited for the premiere but is
no amateur when it comes to the entertain-
ment business. When Lee was a kid, he always
dreamed of being a car salesman, but his in-
terests quickly shifted to the entertainment
business after he memorized everyword to the
entire soundtrack of Disney’s “Aladdin.”

He laughed as he recalled putting on per-
formances with his sister — who took on the
role of Jasmine — for his mom and also at
talent shows.

“Aladdin and I go way back,” Lee said. “But
yeah, I love working with and around people,
and I’ve been interested in theater, movies
and music for along time. My best advice for
young entrepreneurs is to not wait. Don’t wait
for a degree, keep moving forward and learn
from experience.

_“I admire P. Diddy as a businessman and
musician, and I also admire Mark Wahlberg
as an actor, director and producer,” Lee said.
“Wahlberg produces the TV show ‘Entourage,’
which is my favorite show. I love Ari Gold.” zit.

Lee’s attitude reﬂects his success, and this
Pittsburgh native has bigger and better goals
in mind. It would be hard to imagine him stop-
ping anywhere short of the goal his rap persona
suggests: “international” success.

City Game moves again

Pitt and Duquesne will play at Mellon Arena

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

It’s only fitting that things come
full circle for Mellon Arena, a
building with a rather circular
shape.

Pitt and Duquesne, teams in-
volve_d in the first two basketball
games at the arena back in 1961,
will play the last basketball game
there on Dec. 2, the two teams
announced yesterday in a joint
press conference.

Mellon Arena is in its last
season as home of the Pittsburgh
Penguins_and will be replaced
by the Consol Energy Center,
which is scheduled to open in
the fall of 2010.

“This is great for the city of
Pittsburgh,” Pitt coach Jamie
Dixon said. “It’s the right thing
to do. There is a great history
between Pitt and Duquesne in
basketball, and this is an out-
standing way to commemorate
and promote the series.”

On Dec. 6, 1961, Duquesne
beat Carnegie Tech 78-40 and
the Panthers lost to then-No. 1
Ohio State 99-79 in the arena’s
first basketball action. Pitt last
played there March 17, 2004,
against California in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament,
beating the No. 6 Golden Bears
63-50.

The City Game has been
played 34 times at Mellon Arena,
with Pitt compiling a 20-14 re-
cord in those games.

The last time the two played
at Mellon Arena was 2001, when
Pitt won 78-63. The Panthers
hold an eight—game win streak
over Duquesne. The Dukes last
won the City Game win 2001
with a 71-70. A “

Pitt holds a 46-31 record
overall in the history of the
game. 7 . P 

The game will count as "a
home game for Duquesne, as it
was originally intended to take
place at Duquesne’s A._]. Palumbo
Center.

Tagliane tti works his
way to potential starter

Sergei Feldman
Stajf Writer

Pitt sophomore Andrew Taglia-
netti is currently in a battle with
Elijah Fields for the starting free
safety job, but he’s usedto in-
tense competition.

“[My brother Jon] and I
were always encouraged to play
sports,” Taglianetti said, adding
that his parents used athletics as
both a recreational activity and
to instill a degree of competi-
tiveness.

It’s hard not to listen to the
Taglianettis when it comes to
sports, since both parents have
a past of competing at high lev-
els.

Taglianetti’s mother, Alison,
was a swimmer while in college
at Vermont, and his father, Peter,

was a professional hockey player
who played on the Pittsburgh
Penguins’ ’91 and ’92 Stanley Cup
championship-winning teams.
His brother, Jon, is a freshman
linebacker for the Panthers. V

So far, his parents’ encourage;
ment has paid off for Taglianetti;
who surprised even himself by
playing in all 13 games as a fresh-
man and competing for a starting
job this year.

“When I committed to Pitt, I
thought I’d get redshirted,” Ta-
glianetti said.

“I was fortunate enough to
have a good first preseason camp
and did well enough to crack the
ﬁeld for special teams, but things
have gone beyond my expecta-
tions, given the chance to start
on defense now.”

Despite the thrill of develop-
ment and chance to play an ev-

Panthers kick off year with a road victory

Sergei Feldman
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team opened ‘

its season last night with a win over
Robert Morris 3-1 in front of 420
spectators at North Athletic Com-
plex.

, “We didn’t approach things dif-
ferently,” said coachjoe Luxbacher,
referring to his team’s preparation
for a season-opener. “We just ﬁn-
ished our chances tonight, and that
was the difference.”

Part of what made the team suc-
cessful was its new strategy, which
Luxbacher implemented in the off-
season. ,

The new conﬁguration had three
forwards up front, opposed to the
traditional two. While that leaves
the midfield a bit more vulnerable,

the up tempo and aggressive style *

helped Pitt compensate for a lack
of offensive potency. I

s, “We don’t have legitimate big-
time goal scorers,” Luxbacher said.
‘_‘Instead, we’ve got a solid group and
eleven guys working as one.”

Panthers got on the board in the
67th minute when midﬁelder Ryan
Brode scored on a deﬂection off an
indirect kick.

The goal propelled the Panthers,
and they scored another unassisted
goal in the 72nd, minute of the foot
of midﬁelder Mike McDade, who
received the ball on a bounce before
beating Colonials’ goalkeeper Toba
Bolaji. .

Robert Morris had more shots
than Pitt in the second half, 11-7, but
goalkeeper Zack Matthews blocked
all but one.

Pitt put the game away with a
goal from midﬁelder Alex Fischetti
in the 86th minute before Robert
Morris scored its only goal of the
match one minute later.

Luxbacher liked what he saw
from his team, butshe thought some
of the starters underperformed.
Conversely, he liked the play of some
freshmen and players off the bench,
a trend he hope will continue.

“It’s very important to get con-
tributions from the bench,” he
said. “We’re a deeper team [than last
year] and we’re going to need that

ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

After playing in all 13 games last year, mostly on the special teams unit, Taglianetti is
now up for the starting free safety job in his sophomore season.

eryday role for Pitt, Taglianetti’s position
on the team is especially unfamiliar to
him. .

In high school, Taglianetti played run-
ning back, receiver and defensive back
and was productive at each position. At
the collegiate level, especially with a tal-
ented team like Pitt, it’s more difficult to
turn heads.

“It’s a tough adjustment to go from be-
ing a star in high school to having to work
extra hard to earn a role now,” Taglianetti
said. “But you just have to go out there and
earn the respect and do what you have to
do to separate yourself.”

He’s brought that versatility with him
to Pitt. Although he’s a defensive back, he
was also a standout on special teams last
year, blocking three punts and recover-
ing a fumble.

“He’s a throwback kind of player,” Pitt
assistant coach Greg Gattuso said.

That throwback nature transformed
him from long—shot, on-the-ﬁeld contrib-
utor to the player battling for a starting
job on a team picked to win the Big East.
Just a few years ago, Taglianetti wasn’t
even sure he wanted to attend Pitt.

Even though he attended Pittsburgh’s
Central Catholic High School and grew
up in the area, Taglianetti first looked at
attending Louisville and Toldeo. But while
visiting Pitt, Taglianetti thought Oakland
and the various Pitt football facilities

were “just awesome.”

coaching staff.

“No one outworks him or outthinks
him. He’s got all the tools,” Gattuso said.
“He’s got great instincts, and he hits like a
truck. I don’t even think of him as an over-
achiever anymore because he’s running 4.5
[seconds in the 40-yard dash] .”

Taglianetti realizes the importance of
practice to help develop his craft and ulti-
mately contribute to Pitt’s success.

“The hardest part is topping what I did
last year,” Taglianetti said.

“I have to keep stepping up my game
and do as good as I can each year and just
keep adding on.”

His first chance will come Saturday at
Heinz Field against Youngstown State, as
coach Dave Wannstedt expects to use his
skill-set at different points throughout
the game. ~

So long as Taglianetti keeps showing
his versatility, the coaching staff will keep
finding a way to get him on the ﬁeld.

Taglianetti maintains certain personal
goals, but his primary goal is to help Pitt
win the Big East title. S

While that remains a work—in-progress,
Taglianetti deals with the responsibilities
that come with being a student—athlete.
Taglianetti is focused on earning a degree
from a top-tier academic institution. He
hopes to get into Pitt’s business school and
pursue a business management degree.

“A degree from Pitt is huge,” he said.
“Academics are one of my primary focuses.

‘Berenato meets Pitt fans, even in Afghanistan

On her trip, Berenato ran intoa former Pitt student, a Pitt fan from Franklin and woman who played for Jamie Dixon’s sister, Maggi?

"Berenato! 14

’ _'tar and stayed on an Air Force base. While

there, Berenato returned to "the sidelines
to coach the Navy in a basketball game
against a Smith—coached Air Force team.
§ She said both teams were competi-
ive: A
" Berenato said she met three people in
‘ ‘articular who left a lasting impression
n her. ~
 The first was Army engineerjen Bel-
-, emy, who Berenato met previously when
 hey sat next to each other at a dinner. H
‘ Bellemy played basketball at Army and
was on the 2006 NCAA Tournament team
« coached by Maggie Dixon, 'men’s basket-

  
 

ball coach Jamie Dixon’s sister, who died .

in 2006. - A T . —.
 “We talked about when [Bellemy] gets

gout, her going into her coaching. That was ’

"one [person] who wasreally, really cool,

_” Berenato said.
- --T5‘: - _
The second person was Michael Mazza,

gwhom Berenato met in Afghanistan. Maz- ‘

za graduated from Pitt with a doctorate
in English in April 2009.
’- “He came up to me right at the end of
-this one function we were doing and said,
‘I hear Pitt’s in the house!’ and I said, ‘Yeah,
Pitt’s in the house!”’ Berenato said.
V “[Mazza] got his PhD, and it took him
-'13 years,” she said. “Here he is with this
big machine gun on, and he’s like, ‘Oh,
this is like the Batman in me. This is my

exciting life. The English is like my bor-.

4

ing life.”’

Berenato said Mazza leads the police in
Afghanistan, working to bring together a
police force by recruiting people to gather

7 Evehicles and uniforms.

He was an adjunct professor at Pitt for
seven years.

“He was the coolest man, so I took the
microphone and I was like, ‘Everyone, give

 -‘tne your attention!’ and I gave a shout to
 3Michael Mazza and how he ﬁnished his
~ 3PhD,” Berenato said. “Everyone started
 ‘cheering and clapping, so that was re-

 

ally cool.” V I
The ﬁnal person she discussed was
Steve Bell, a Pittsburgh fan from Franklin,
Pa., who told Berenato of his connection
to the LA Fitness shooting last month. Bell
was best friends with shooting victim and
former Pitt-Johnstown basketball player
Jody Billingsley.
' “That just tore me apart. Here he is,

ﬁghting over there, carrying a gun, and he’s
struggling because his dearest friend from
America was killed,” Berenato said.

Berenato also met people from Pitts-
burgh who humbled her with their ap-
preciation. . l I

Many of them watched the Pitt women
play on television against Gonzaga and
Oklahoma in last year’s NCAA Tourna-

rnent.

“They were all just thanking me for
coming over there to the point where I was
embarrassed by their gratitude because I
was over there to thank them,” Berenato

‘said. “I’m just a coach. Who wouldn’t go

if they had the opportunity to do that?
You just can’t imagine how much it really
means to them.”
