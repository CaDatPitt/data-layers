GREEKS REQUEST
FOUR CHANGES
IN RUSH RULES

Move To Accept Committee’s
Report At Special Meet
Last Night

cur DEFERRED PERIOD

‘Seek Lower 1 Scholarship‘ To
Pledging; Drop Preferred
V Bidding

I'nterf1-aternity Council‘ accepted
an investigating committee’s recom-
mendation that four major changes

‘be made to its deferred -rushing

rul\es‘at a meeting called last‘ night
by Tom Blair, Dent. ’29, president.

With seventeen fraternities rep-
resented at the meeting, it was de-

' cided to recommend to the frater-

nity cominittee of ,the University
Council that fraternities be allowed
to defer their rushing for seven
weeks instead of one se1nester,.that
twelve quality points, with twelve
credits be re-quired for initiation in-
stead of pledging, that men be al-
lowed contact with fraternities later
than 9 o’clock each evening," and
that preferential bidding and silence
week be abolished. These rules can-
not go into effect until they have

«been accepted by a joint committee .

composed of the officers of inter-
fraternity council _and the fraternity
committee.

Would Rush in November

Should these rules be accepted,
rushing will begin at 8:30 o’clock
Monday morning, November 12, for
freshmen who enter in September’,
and will extend for twelve days, ter-
minating, at‘ midnight, November 24.‘
This modiﬁcation was accepted by
council, with six ‘opposing votes.

-Two fraternities opposed‘ the
change, which would allow a fresh-
man.to be pledged regardless of , _fs,
grades, but which would require t, at
he pass twelve quality points with
twelve credits in one semester'be-
fore initiation. Under the present
rules this requirement is necessary
for pledging.

‘The« body voted unanimously to
retain the rules which prohibit fra-
ternities from holding more than
ﬁve regularly scheduled rushing»
events _and make. it illegal for fresh-_
men --to remain overnight at a. fra-

, temity _house- or 'at_j_he. home _of"a

fraternity R man" ‘a‘s"'his' i_”Witl_i}‘
six opposing votes, the resolution to

.abolish preferential bidding through

the deanrof men’s office and, to,iIt-_
stitute a period of ‘silence while -the
bidsare .transmitted,~ was accepted.
Two’ houses voted to retain the rule
"which prohibits contact by frater-
nity men with rushees after‘ 9
-o’-clock at other than scheduled rush-_

Joint Committee Holds Vote" A
Whetherthe joint committee will

iliarken to these requests for modiﬁ-

cations will be announced at a- next
meeting of council, April 2, at the
Pi Lambda Phi chaptershouse. The
changes were -only “recommended”
to the joint committee, which may

‘take any action it sees ﬁt.

These two committees will meet
in C. R. ,Wilson’s office Tuesday

- afternoon to decide-the matter. Vot-
ing was even at the meeting Tues-

day in that the same fraternities»
usually opposed the same changes
to the rules.

"* , light pink dress, ﬂesh stockings and
black shoes. Much cosmetics adorn-
ed his features. lt,was his concep-

 Number two was in full dress with
 his black bow tie pointing north and

GABBERT DISCUSSES
RELIGION OF MODERNS

MORGANTOWN, W. Va}, March
27.——Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, head of
the department of philosophy at
.Pitt,~last week ‘delivered the clos-
ing address of a student religious
conference held here during the
week-end. Dr. Gabbert, speaking in.
the First Methodist Episcopal
Church, discussed modern religion.

Interpreting religion in terms of
everyday language, the Pitt philos-

‘ opher declared that the college stu-
dent is rare who is ready to stand
on his own feet and declare that he
,1. has an idea or is a true individual.
 “Don’t let anybody kid you along
 till you imagine religion is some-
.,thing, to be indifferent about,” Dr.
 Gabbert ‘counseled the students.
V ‘The conference opened in the
AV Methodist Episcopal Church-, with
; Dr. Gabbert and Dr. Harold Holt,
ofeNe,w York City, assistant execu-
“tive secretary of the board of social
service of the Episcopal Church, as-
”_ri_n ipal speakers”. , '

  FROSH ARMBANDS

“-To Dink,/,0: Not To Dink”
‘May Worry Men; Women
Find No Contention

 

 

 

"To dink or not to dink” may be
‘the worry that is molesting the men
at present, but arm bands, back-
doors and all the other features of
freshmen regulations are no prob-'
lem to Pitt women. ,

“It’s no stigma. to wear a blue and
gold arm band,” Elaine Foraker, Col.
‘.32, a member of Pitt Players; ex-
plained. “Regulations help 'us get
acquainted with upper classmen,”
says Louise -Linn, Col. ’32, of the
debating squad. Other freshmen who
wear merit panthers, tokens of suc-
cessful passing‘ of their regulations,
agree that they are 9. pleasure most
of the time. “The lonesome feeling
is taken from the ﬁrst few weeks,”
Gertrude Reoterwalcl, -Col. ’32, e a
Weekly regorteriiand niember of W.

. G. A., elieves. Christine Ruoﬂ’,
Col. ’32, president of freshmen wom-
e‘n’s class, is enthusiastic about the
help that the armbands are in bring-

each other.

‘ Upper classmen are ‘ust as
pleased. Sarah Drumm, 01. '31,
vice chairman of the customs com-
mittee, -thinks the incentive of the
merit panthers gets freshmen» into
activities sooner. Winifred McClure,
chief justice of senior court, has
watched them» function with obvious
aid to freshmen for four years. Her-
mine Ruoif, Col. ’31, chairman of

Praised By Visitor

 “Fraternity organization for
women at Pitt is superior in
every detail, to that of other
universities I. have visited,”
observes Alice Brown, national
travelling, secretary of Y. W.
C. A., recently a visitor at the
University, when asked what
feature of Pittlife seemed un-
usual to her.

Arriving at Pitt in,the' midst
of rushing season, Miss Brown
noticed the quietness which
prevailed. “I think deferred
rushing, such as you have, is a
_great advantage to everyone
concerned. Although I have
seen it used in many other
schools, I have never found
sLi'ch a thorough system of pre-_
paratory education for fresh-
men as there is at Pitt.”

Comparing, .Pitt with other
, urban 'colle es,‘ Miss Brown
, said, “I thin Pitt is, in most.
respects”, a typical metropoli-
tan school, but its locationis
more fortunate. The view on
a clear day is something no
other college can boast of.”

ammer brought to themeeting the
revised‘ sketches of the room, the
entire designs to be completed in
his studio in New York. ' V
.. Rev.‘ J. V. Benson, chairman of
the Swedish committee, called atten-
tion to the fact that the mystic
colors of Pitt are the same as the
colors of the state of ‘Pennsylvania,
and that blue and gold are the
Swedish colors and the ﬁrst presi-
dent. of the territory now included
in Pennsylvania was ‘Lt. Col. John
Prince,,a Swede. Hedeclared the
fact was particu1a13y symbolicalto
all "the delegates. , _ ,,

At» this meeting the following
resolution was passed": ‘ A '

Help Women Secure

A special meeting for women in-
terested .in summer work was held
last Thursday at Heinz house by
Miss Isabelle ~ Anderson, women’s
employment director.

Miss Anderson {pointed out the
demand for summer positions and
the uncertainty of deﬁnitely con-
tracting for work this early. _She
sugg‘est,ed names of hotels which
usually need waitresses. The girls

were given practical hints on the
of' applying‘ for‘ jobs,

technique
either in.pe‘rson or-by letter. I

In order to help every applicant
to ﬁnd work, Miss Anderson asked
theglirls to turn all opportunities
for positions "w‘hich‘rth.ey could not

EIGHTY-NINE. MEN REPORT

Three ‘Temporary Elevens Go
Through Signal Drills
At Practice Field

 

With the ‘first scrimmage sched-
uled after"Easter vacation, the Pan-

ther football squad will don their‘ .
pads today to hit the dummies and . ~

to practice the art of charging the
line. Following an ultimatum issued
by Jock Sutherland, no new men will
be added to the‘ squad without spe-
cial dispensation from him, as 89
recruits" answered the call to
promised gridiron fame.

After a week of light calisthenics,
the team began its real work Mon-
day, learning the signals, running
dummy scrimmage, drop kicking,
punting and plunging into the
chargin , machine. Yesterday, as a
result _o the training, the squad was
divided into ’, teams which ran sig-

als.

'Mike Getto and Alec Fox, last
year star linesmen, reported Monday .
to take on the coaching of two raw .
squads. and taught the line in gen- .
eralv the secrets of their success.»

Mike, in his energetic fashion, took
part in the calisthenic drill preced-
ing the practice. ,
‘Although no positions have been
determined, Jock has been running
certain men on deﬁnite squads until
new and better material showsup.
The first team is composed of
Barnes, center; Montgomery and Di-
Meolo, guards;.- Tully and Corson,
tackles‘ and, Donchess and. Loehr,
ends’. The backﬁeld held Parkinson,

It would be hard top distribute the
glory equally amongthe members
of the Pitt squad. Utterback, the
great negro athlete, was the high
point man for the day, and probably
did as‘ muchtoward winning the
meet as anyone else. He started the
day off by taking" third -in the open

heels of'Schellback of the Dukes.
Then he got warmed up and took the
broad jump. This was his biggest
victory of the day, for in winning
he was forced to beat out_Furth of
N. Y. U., who was recently crowned
national indoor intercollegiate cham-
ion at New York. He and Marshall

jump, both clearing 5 feet 8'inches.
Incidentally he won a fourth place

- were the brilliants of the Phi Delt

crew, Donchess scoring four ﬁeld
goals. Getting off to an early lead,
the Kappa Sigs held the overhand
throughout the game, letting up only
in the third quarter. I
Playing a game, scheduled for
tomorrow, last Monday, the Pi Lams
capped‘ the Thursday division title
by defeating the Omega Delts, their
nearest rival in the race, 35-8. In a
fast game that turned into a com-
plete walk;-over, the Pi Lams proved
real champions as they handed the
Omega Delts a real setback. Jacobs,
Kantz and Levin were the stars of
the Pi Lam squad, while Biddle led
the Omega Delts, The game was
featured by neat work on both sides,

Vllllt the Pi Lams were too good for

their o ponents. ,
On riday, the Kappa Nus dc-
feated the Sigma Pis, 25-10. The

the open and special 70-yard dashes,

Coach Jock Sutlierland and the
Pitt football team have gone'- into
the “talkies.” The Pathe ‘Sound
News and the RCA Photophone peo-
ple dropped into the stadium the
other day and the phlegmatic Scot
was kind, enough to put his crew
through their paces and_ even make
a little speech himself for talkies.

The Pathe ' and" RCA’ company
have been making a tour -of thebig
universities in the country getting
news and sound; of collegiate doings.
On this; last trip they stopped at

Penn and -Dartmouth and took some ~

scenes theite. As the. ‘Pitt football
team is pickedto ﬁnish right around
the top of the nation’s best next
year they thought it advisable_ to

drop" in and ‘look‘ the" Golden _Pan- '

thers over.

Accordinghto the boys whoiworked .

"the cameras and whatever the gad-

get is that takes in the sound,'Jock .
‘made an ideal actor. He was also a
ﬁne director, ‘furnishing many of the .

ideas for the ‘ different groupings,
and also putting the boys through
their paces without any confusion.
One of the best scenes -of the
whole lot was when Luby Dimeolo
led his team out on the stadium turf.
It looked',lik.e a stampede in the
Chicago stockyards. Jock was asked
to answer the age old question,
“What happens in a huddle .” With
a temporary varsity lined up. and
with Charley Edwards doing. the

time takes on quite anpimpor-,
