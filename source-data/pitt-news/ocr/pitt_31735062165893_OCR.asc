Discrimination Committee Established

Students, Professors Join
To Demand Prompt Action

By KATHIE EDWARDS

As a result of the SU Forum panel discussion Monday on.
“Racial Discrimination at Pitt,” a student—faculty commit-
tee has been formed to urge strong action by the University
against ‘racial prejudices. A petition will be drawn up and
be ready for distribution by next Monday, stating the aims
of the group and the stand they wish the University to take.

At the discussion, following introduction statements by
the panel members, questions were hurled _thick and fast. Dr.
William'B. Crafts, dean of men, bore the brunt of the in-
formation-seeking students. “I still feel sort of black and
blue,” he remarked after the Forum series had ended. “I real.-
ized that it would be a heated discussion, but it got a little

Parking Meter
Hearings Set
For Future

Pending hearings -to be held at
a yet to be ‘announced date in the
near future, City Council will put
the Oakland parking proposal into
effect for a sixty day trial period
beginning on June 15 it was an-
nounced last Monday by James J.
Dillon, Director of Public Safety.

At the hearings petitions may
be presented and motions enter-
tained regarding solutions to the
parking problems which faculty
members and students would en-
counter should the proposal go
into effect permanently.

Matthew Swetonic, Pitt News
news editor and chairman of the
recent petition campaign, stated
that “City Council has promised
to give us a week’s notice prior
to the hearing so that we might
prepare a brief to be present-
ed to Council at that time along
with the 2,000 names which we
collected on the petitions.”

After speaking to the City
Clerk last week concerning the
date of the proposed hearing,
Swetonic commented that “it
seems that The Pitt News is not
the only organization interested
in the outcome of the parking
squabble. A number of other peo-
ple have requested that they be
informed prior to the meeting in-
cluding SG’s Pete Bijur and
Chancellor Litchﬁeld.”

Convocation Honors

Teller, 650

The sixth annual Honors Convocation was held this

Stu dents

morning in the Syria Mosque.‘ The proceedings began at

10:15 a.m. with a processional of faculty and
from the Cathedral to the Mosque. ‘ -

administrators

Approximately 650 honor students from_ the various
schools participated in the convocation. Included among the

honored undergraduates
over 100 students from Johns-
town College.

Physicist Edward Teller, who
played a key role in the develop-
ment of nuclear energy in the
United States, was the featured
speaker and was awarded an hon-
orary Doctor of Science degree by
the Chancellor.

Rankin Presents

The honor students were pre-
sented to the faculty and to the
University by Dr. Allan C‘. Ran-
kin, assistant chancellor for stu-
dent and general affairs.

In a written statement ap-
pearing on the Convocation
program Chancellor Litchﬁeld
stated that the honor “students
have clearly recognized the ﬁrst
reason for a university’s exis-
tance—to foster excellence in
education. The Honors Convo-
cation serves to reatﬁrm the
University’s commitment to ex-
cellence, so that the value of
our society is sustained against
lesser or contrary values.

“Excellence is the hallmark of

bit beyond my expectations. How-9
ever, this is the kind of thing we
must expect and encourage,” the
said. ‘

Much Improvement

Crafts, in the course of his in-
troductory statement, said that
the University, has done much to
improve the racial situation in the
campus community. Several stu-
dents questioned this, demanding
to know, “Is it enough?” Crafts
answered rather evasively that,
“I don’t know how the University
will move forward, but it is not
opposed to doing so.”

Mr. L. Ma-son, executive di-

rector of the Mayor’s Commis-
sion on Human Relations, replied
that policies are not enough.
They must be stringently fol-
lowed. “It seems to me that
there is no chance of compro-
‘misc or shirking of the Uni-
tversity’s duty as a leading in-
stitution in the area,” he said.
“It is a ﬁne chance for that in-
stitution to take the lead where
it should?’

Crafts suggested several times
that racial prejudice must be
overcome by an evolutionary pro-
cess and not ’rash_ actions. Dr.
Warren d’Azevedo, assistant pro-
fessor of anthropology, disagreed,
saying that no social change takes I
place by itself or by some internal
force. “It takes someone to get out
and do something about it,” he
declared. “People must act!” '

“I personally believe that the
University administration should
take a deﬁnite, ﬁrm stand,” he

Mellon History Professor
Discusses U.S. Foreign Policy

Examining the United
States’ current Latin , Ameri-
can Policy April 6 will be Dr.
Dexter Perkins, visiting An-
drew Mellon Professor of
History. He will speak on

idealism and pragmatism in
American foreign policy.

Professor Perkins‘ lecture is
one of eight in an informal c-ourse
called “Behind the Diplomatic
Headlines” which will be held
Apri 1 and continue through May
20. The courses are for adults
who want to continue their edu-
cation without formally seeking
a degree.

An authority on the Monroe
Doctrine, Dr. Perkins does not
think it is dead, but'he does
think it might" be better if the
U.S.._ didn’t talk so much about

it. “The words ‘Monroe Doctrine’
are offensive to Latin American
pride. Furthermore, we are bound
not to intervene unilaterally in
the hemisphere by several pro-
tocols and treaties signed with
our Latin neighbors over the
years.” '

Although Dr. Perkins techni-
cally retired a decade ago, he
has continued to lecture and
write. He is Professor Emeritus
of History, University of R0-
chester, and University Profes-
sor Emeritus of American Civ-
ilization, Cornell University.
He has received the M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees at Harvard Uni-
versity.

Among his many published
Works are: The Monroe Doctrine,

...Clidets.iiContracted for Four Trimcsters

Army ROTC Students F ind
It Impossible toQuit Corps

Because students have com-
plained about not being able to
get out of the Army ROTC pro-
gram for personal reasons, The
Pitt News has investigated this
problem. I

The News found that any stu-
dent who decides to join Army
ROTC must remain in it*for four
trimesters
has a contract with the army
guaranteeing this. Any student
who decides to join Army ROTC
is supposed to know this before
he joins. His advisor was supposed
to have told him.

A student may be relieved from
ROTC “for the convenience of the
government,” stated Colonel Ray-
mond A. Banks, professor of mili-
tary science. “This includes phy-
sical. disabilities, inaptitude for
the program, and failure to main-
tain grades. A student cannot be
dropped for his own convenience.
The Army puts a gerat deal of
money into the program and ex-

' pects returns for it.”

Colonel Banks contends that he
does not “know of any student in
serious trouble because of want-

'ing to drop ROTC. Seniors have

had to take freshman and sopho-
more courses over again in order
to graduate, but this is nothing
new as far as the University is
concerned.”
“Students,” asserted the colo-
inel.‘ “have to have some_good
justiﬁcation for wanting to get
out of ROTC other than just not
liking it. Their reasons must be
valid.” A
The colonel included physical
disabilities that had been pre-
viously overlooked or that had
developed since a student "joined
ROTC as valid reasons for drop-
ping out of the program. Emo-

, tional difficulties are also taken

into consideration. They normally
come under the title “inaptitude
for the program.”

“Some people are completely
uncoordinated,” said the cglonel.
“They can’t handle themselves, let
alone others. They become emo-
tionally unstable when they have
to work with or lead other men.
Some don’t display any potential
for leadership.”

If a student falls into any of
these categories, or fails to
maintain a 2.0. QPA, then he
may be dropped from the ROTC
program. He must, however,
.wait at least a year before dis-
charge action will be taken.
Every Army cadet, theoretical-
ly, knows all this since ‘I bulle-
tin had been sent out to ad-
visors.

Before anyone is discharged,
after he ﬁlls any of the above
qualiﬁcations “he is given a pretty
thorough screening by the staff.”

The Army allows a student to
decide to drop the course on his
own. The student is not, however,
dropped from the program. The
consequence of this is that the

since the University.

student cannot graduate "until he’
completes the._four trimesters of
basic ROTC work.
The Army does work with the
University, a student advisor,
and the school of the individual
if,a student wants to be drop-.
ped from the program. If the
Dean of any student's school re-
quests that the student he drop-
ped “and has valid reasons for
this request, it »will be consid-
ered.” ,

Some examples of valid reasons
given by Colonel Banks are that
the program “could interfere with
the academic program so that he
would be unable to ta-ke required
academic courses and army cours-
es. This has never been a major
problem,” the colonel added,
“since we will adjust the ROTC
schedule to those of the cadets
who are having scheduling prob-
lems.

“If the Dean felt that the stu-
dent was undergoing such an
emotional strain that it was af-
fecting his other academic work,
the student could be dropped.”

Glee Club

Slates Concert

For Saturday

The Men’s Glee Club will pre-.
sent its spring’ concert Saturday
at 8:30 p.m. in the«SU Ballroom.
General admission at $1 and stu-
dent admission at 50 cents are;
payable at the door,

Director Emmanuel Rubin said
he will include “familiar show
songs and new adapted numbers
in our program.” Curt Ebitz will
do the solo in “The Drummer and
the Cookie.” The‘ Varsity Quartet?
-— composed of Wade Silverman,
David Savage, Joseph Romito, and
Al Rich — will also appear.

‘The 38 member chorus will di-‘ ,
vide into two parts to present
“Adoramus Te” by Palestrina.
Rubin said that this arrangement.
to place the choruses on opposite
sides of the room is consistent"
with the traditional “glees,” sev-
eral men’s choral groups.

Special Arrangements

Donald Colton of the Univer-
sity’s music department especial-
ly arranged “For All the Saints”
for’ this concert. As in previous
concerts, the club will again sing

Rubin expects many Glee.

‘ Cl/uh alumni to attend this "ﬁnal

year. He also mentioned that

students interested in singing

cers for the coming year.

Once again the colonel‘ had at
addendum. “The Dean of Men has
only been brought in once when a
student’s emotional p r o bl elm s,
caused by ROTC, were affecting
his family life and his academics.”
Thei Army feelsthat “over a

period of four trimesters, the
army has had an opportunity to
observe the student and to
evaluate his potential and the
student has had time to eval-
uate the prozram and decide
whether he -wants to take an
advanced course and earn a
commission.”

pear to have been passed on to
students interested in the Army’s
program. According to Colonel
Banks, the problem evolved from
the breakdown, of communications
through the University. The De-
partment. is planning on writing
up another bulletin for/the ad-
visors. This. is what the Army
feels any student itnerested in
ROTC should have known before
deciding whether or not he ,want-
ed to join. ' —

think’ that this relieves other

"members of the University com-
munity from putting pressure on
the administration and supporting
them. -

Crafts was asked whether he

i believed that if, the University
took a solid stand against dis-
crimination, would racial rela-
tions be improved. He merely
‘restated that the University
must work “as a concert.” In
answer to several other student
questions, Crafts repeated,

“Again, I_ have no answer.”

Hannington Okoth, shook his
ﬁst and declared that, “There is
something wrong with the 12th
ﬂoor (Dean of Women’s_ Oﬂice) of
the Cathedral.” He added that
“these are the things that should
be mentioned in such a .discus-
sion,” as he suggested a petition,
to be signed by all interested fac-
.ulty and students" and submitted
‘to the administration.

The petition states: We hereby
move that the chancellor of the
University make a formal state-
ment over press, radio, and TV
that his administration will take
all actions necessary to uphold

the law where professed practices
of discrimination have been made

Action on Race Issues

by any student, faculty member,
or University personnel, and that
the University will not condone
any such actions in Oakland or
Pittsburgh.

D’Azevedo said after the dis-
cussion that the petition was a
reasonable one. “It is stated
well, and is purely a request for .
action to be taken,” he said. “I
feel that the students were re-
markably sensible and well-be'-
haved, considering the serious
and controversial subject.”

In his introductory remarks, Dr.
M. El Aramany, president of the
Foreign Students Council,‘ protest-
ed that racial discrimination is ir-
rational and that the problem
“must be settled more positively
by the University.” Judy Diet-

clared that the problem lies basic-
ally with people —- the students.

Panelist I-Ierk Jones, a senior
English _major, said that Negroes
at the University know that, dis-
crimination exists here, but that
most of them simply ignore it, be-
cause they feel nothing will be
done.’

“Racial discrimination is your
fault,” said Mason in his pre-

liminary statement. “No one has

the intestinal fortitude to com-
plain to our ofﬁce or to back up

complaints that are made.”‘

K Zen is Quite Natural,
P Says Dr. George Fowler

Dr. George Fowler, president of the First Zen Institute
in New York City, believes, “Being at home with yourself

.and the world attracts people to Zen.” Dr. Fowler voiced
‘this opinion on Monday afternoon at a lecture on Zen spon-

. sored by the Freshman Council.
According to History Professor, the World Wars kindled

. the spark of Western interest in$

the Occidental civilization. He
stated that the Eastern cultures
seem to offer the “something
solid” for which the industralized
Western man is tormentingly
searching.

In deﬁning Zen Buddhism Fow-
ler asserted, “Zen is the tradi-
tion basically formed when Budd-
hism came to China.” In further
clarifying this belief, ‘he stated
that Zen is the part of the Budd,-
hist tradition which stresses med-
itation, the aim of which is to
reach an awakened state of mind.

To reach this state of mind,
an individual must possess the
“intestinal fortitude” to look at
himself, stated Fowler. In addi-
tion, Fowler asserts that such
an individual must inquire into

A his existence and ask himself

“who is he, for what purpose he
is here, and what his relation-
ship to the world at large is.”

Fowler heartily attacked the
faddish interest in Zen ‘Buddhism,
a belief which he considers to
be an austere and aristocratic
one. He stated, “The subtle es-
sence of Zen is so natural that
it is apt to be missed;” apparently
too subtle for J. D. Salinger and
Jack Kerouac according to Fow-
ler. . —

In commenting on‘the beatniks’
intense interest in Zen, Fowler
asserted, “The beats have turned
to Zen because they ‘do not un-
derstand their own world and un-
derstand the Occidental world

' even less.”

The audience’s response to. the

‘lecture was admirable. Forthose

\

  

who wished to dig deeper into
Zen Buddhism after this intro-
duction, Fowler recommended the

4 ,.
"“" book, An Anthology of Zen.‘

The ad_hoc racial'discrimination committee which was
established after Monday’s rather dramatic SU Forum

. Series discussion on the subject may prove to be the ﬁrst

step in an effective student-faculty. plan of action or, as one
member of the panel indicated, it may lead to nothing
more than a pitiful poke. We sincerely hope that the former
will be "true; we feel that if the organizers of the commit-I
tee retain the admirable enthusiasm and ideals with-which
they have begun, support should grow for their plans for
bringing racial issues out into the open and forcing ﬁrm ac-
tion against discriminatory elements of the University and
Oakland community.

.. As has been pointed out already in Pitt News editorials,
columns, and Mosaic essays, on several occasions, racial dis-
crimination does, unfortunately,‘ exist on several levels at
the University to a limited, but still despicable degree. The
subject was discussed at a Faculty Senate meeting when

 some members demanded that the University blacklist a

club which practiced discrimination, an action which caused

‘ the administration to restate its brief and, therefore, some-

what unsatisfactory policy on tolerance.. Discrimination has
reared its head about a hundred times, one of the racial
committeemen reports, as one member of the Forum panel
states he has documented that many instances. And dis-
criminatory action against i‘nter—racial dating couples stem-
ming from the 12th floor of the Cathedral has been report-
ed to this oﬁice time after time, week after week, since the
beginning of the school year. ‘

. To saythat something must be done is an understate-
ment. Everyone is interested in racial problems, but not
everyone will transform his interest into action. Groups like
the Foreign Student Association and the recently-formed
committee on racial problems contain the students and fac-
ulty members who share the most interest in the problems

and who can, if they act wisely, develop the support of the ~

majority. It is hoped that they will tread wisely and care-
fully, and not lose sight of their goals and if such is the
case, the student newspaper supports them wholeheartedly.

Racial discrimination exists here. Some people are try-

ring to ignore that fact. Others are trying to do something

about it. Most are in the middle, but can be led against the
medieval practice of discrimination if their leaders are
strong. ’ ‘ '

r-———Time Allotments

Grades Vs.

Activities A 

The requirements for a student to be known and-
respected by the other students on campus. To
achieve this goal the said student must belong to
several organizations, in other words have extra
curricular activities and belong
to a number of honoraries also.
For this the student must have
good grades. Thus, a successful
student must prudently ‘allocate
his time to studies and activities.

Of the two phases, grades are e
the more important and conse-
quently stressed more at the
University. Scholastic honorar— .
ies at different. levels of aca-
demic career and Honors con-
vocation emphasizes the scholas-
tic achievements. ,

Frequently, however, students become involved
in an activity or ,a number of activities and conse-
quently let their grades suffer. Then these students,
usually try to shift the, blame elsewhere and be-
moan the fact that the present grading system is
not equatable. “Examinations do not give a fair
account of the students’ capabilities.” Term papers
are also vetoed on the ground that they.do not ac-
complish anything or establish the genius of a
student. . .

Such chronic complainers have no suggestion to
offer as to what should take the place-of tests and
examinations than to say that there should be no
grades either. Thus they are in effect saying that
all students wise and otherwise should be placed
on an equal footing. C This is not only against the
precepts of the capitalist system! which stresses

and rewards individual initiative and hard work,
but is not even practiced in the communist states.
There, all wages are brought in equilibrium but
every one is assigned his job where he is most
competent. Having no grading system would elimi-
nate the source of competition and remove the ;
gauge by which two persons in the same ﬁeld may '  

.,‘ "T

‘be compared. - -

I feel that the present grading system, though
not always the best, is a fair~and equitable one
and till such time that a better grading system is
evolved, the present system will have to suffice and
the thing to do is to adjust to it.

Often, students with high grades argue that they
can not join an organization because their grades
will suffer. I feel that this is not a valid excuse:
one does not have to become unduly involved in an 
activity, but everyone should have or take time
from his studies to devote some time to the group
or groups of his choice. I ,

Honoraries are select societies that recognize a

valuable service in a given area and at the same i
time for minimum acceptable quality in their aca- 
demic work. No compromise should be made in ac-, 
cepting'"a person to an honorary who has failed to 
do so. To do so, as is done by several honoraries, g
would be to defeat the purpose of the honorary and "
condone the fact that ' an individual has given" 9 
more importance to his extra—curricular activity’( Fl
rather than to his school work. ' l ' *1

Thus, I feel that both'academic work and be- ,5!

sible balance must be reached between the two.

  LETTERS To THE EDITOR

Nine from Physics
Dept. Object to Teller

Editor, The Pitt News:

On April 3, the University of
Pittsburgh is planning to award
an honorary degree to _physicist
Edward Teller. This seems to
imply that the University not
merely approves but admires Dr.
Teller’s well known political
views. ‘

In our opinion the policies ad-
vocated by Dr. Teller serve only
to increase the mutual distrust
between the United States and
the Soviet Union and would, if
adopted by the United States
government, lead inevitably to
nuclear obliteration.

In short, we believe that Dr.
Teller has been of disservice
both to the United States and
to the cause of world peace.

Certainly we do not object to
Dr. 'Teller’s being freely ac-
corded a platform at this Uni-
versity. But we do-wish to pub-
licly dissociate ourselves from

:5” the decision of the University

Editor, The Pitt News:

On April 3 the University of
Pittsburghis planning to award;

an honorary degree to physicist
Edward Teller. We (members of

the faculty of the Department of
Physics) would like.to inform?"
the students "of the University;
and the people of Pittsburgh
that this choice was‘ made by:
3. n d the;

the Administration
Board of Trustees of "the Uni-

‘versity without consulting the‘
‘.faculty of the Department of «
Physics (31 large majority of this"
voted '

faculty w ould have
against- an honorary degrees for
Dr. Teller).

We disapprove of this award
because we believe that Dr. Tel-

ler has behaved irresponsibly’
both as a scientist and as a gov-- _

ernment advisor in. his opposi-
tion to international agreements
that might relax tensions and

reduce the possibility of ’ war. I

His well known position for

the continuation of the arms’

race .would, if’ argued honestly,
be respected even by those of
us who disagree with this posi-
tion. _

However, in his public opposi-
tion to any agreement on arms
control, disarmament or dis-

continuance of atomic weapons E

' testing he has misused his rep-
utation as a scientist by pre-
senting questionable and
specious speculations as though
they were well established and
relevant facts.

Moreover, his devotion to his

 _ own convictions had led him to

imply that a colleague (J. Rob-
ert Oppenheimer) was a security
risk’ without giving, any sup-

Nothing that we have said is
meant to suggest that Dr. Tel-
ler should not be heard or that
he should not be accorded a
platform at this University. Our
objection is to his being honored
and presented to our students

and our community as an emin-
ent ‘scientist and leader worthy
of emulation.

Parking Areas Puzzle

_.lohns’rown Visitor

Editor, The Pitt News:
Recently I came down to visit
the Pitt campus and to get a
look at my future home. After
spending an enjoyable day tour-
ing the campus, "I returned to
my car and found a parking

ticket on it which read: “Park-,

ing in a restricted area.”

Fine, except how was I to
know that I had parked in a
restricted area when there were
no signs posted to that effect?

When I returned to Johns-
town, I picked up acopy of The
Pitt News and read about the
anti-meter petitions. I would
like to add a comment to that:

The University doesn’t need

any more parking meters as long

. as it doesn’t put up signs warn-

ing of No Parking areas; the
University should be able to
make good off of the visitors

who come to the campus ig-S .

A Foreign Civil Engineers See City

Uraguay Students
Visit United States

By BONNIE WHITMAN

Most of the 20 civil engineering students from Uruguay
did not think they would like to work in the United States
after graduating from the University of Uruguay. Said Luis
Grosskopf, 7‘We feel a need to do something for our country.
There is a great need of engineers in Uruguay.”

Last week these students spent a few days visiting the

University and Pittsburgh.

They were brought to the
United States by the State De-
partment to see American.meth-
ods of construction and to see

how Americans study engineering,

They will be in the U.S. for 30
days.
We’re More Religious

Grosskopf, Jose Pargman, and
Anibal de Loy all agreed that the
American family is essentially the
same as that of Uruguay. The
only differences they noted were
that “the Americans are more re-
ligious,” and that there is more
automation in the U.S.

DeLoy also observed that life
is different in each city. For
instance, they were impressed
with the fast pace of New
York in contrast with the slow-
or pace of Pittsburgh.

“If you stop a person on the
street here, they seem glad to
help you. We have not found this
in other countries we have visit-
ed,” stated Grosskopf.

Anxious to Talk

The students seemed anxious to
talk of their country. The Uni-
versity of Uruguay in Montevideo,
is the country’s only university.
It is the smallest country in
South America. Some of the dif-
ferences they noted between their
university and those of the‘ U.S.
were that there are no gym re-
quirements in Uruguay and they
have no dormitories.

All students live at home, or,
if they come from far away,
they live in an apartment or
with a family in Montevideo.

Pargman observed that the so-
cial problems are worse in Uru-
guay than in the United States
since they have many more poor
people. But, Grosskopf pointed
out, “we have a middle class that
is bigger than both the rich and
poor classes.” He added that Uru-
guay is the only country in South

De Loy mentioned that Uruguay

When asked what they
thought of the Alliance for

Field Trip Sponsored to Capitol

—-K Graduate Librarians
Tour Washington

Students in the Graduate School of Library Science took
a ﬁeld trip to Washington, D.C. for three days beginning last

Thursday.

Their ﬁrst stop was the National Library of Medicine in
Bethesda, Maryland, where they heard a speech about the
 ‘library by the director and then toured the library. There

they saw the new
which will be used later this year
to help publish Index Medicus, as
well as to provide special biblio-
graphy and other things.

Computers Used

The computers also provide a
large amount. of inter-library
loans, working at the rate of one
per minute. A mobile camera is
used to photograph the particular
section that is wanted or the
whole section is microfilmed and
a copy made by the xerox pro-
cess.

In the History of Medicine
Division at the library the stu-
dents saw a large collection of
old medical books and mono-
graphs. Most of the books at
the library are underground,
and the building was construct-
ed in such a. way that it should

“‘ " be blast resistant.

The students next visited the
Government Printing Ofﬁce in
Washington, D.C. where they were
taken on a tour, ending up in the
bookstore. From there they went

to the National Agricultural Li-I

brary where they saw the original
“photoclerk,” -which, though it
was made in 1948, is still being
used. ' .
Attended ALA Meetings
That night some of the students
went to an American Library As-
sociation meeting where they met
the president and heard a speech
on “Automation in the Library.”
The students spent Friday at
the Library of Congress. After
hearing Dr. L. Quincy Mumford,
librarian of Congress, speak on
“Organization of the Library of’
Congress,” they went on a gen-

‘,._,( eral tour of the library.

ﬁe-rGs._

   

Some of the places they saw

Longer Than Expected

The tours took longer than ex-
pected and the students did not
have time for interviews with the
personnel about jobs, according to
Ronald Wiley.

The students also visited the
Library Service Branch where
they heard about its work and
saw some audio-visual equip-
ment. Through the branch, the
Library Service Act is carried
out, bringing about new and
improved library service.

After a short sightseeing tour
of Washington Saturday morning,
the students visited a special li-
brary dealing with Shakespeare.
They spent the afternoon in the
Enoch Pratt Free Library in
Baltimore, returning to the Uni-
versity that night.

assistant, a member of Lambda
Chi Alpha, and on the Varsity
Marching Band.

The slate was approved by a.
nominating committee consist-
ing of senior .members of the
SU Board as well as Larry Hell-
er,. faculty director of the
Board.

According to Woody Cross, out-
going Student‘ Chairman, “The
potential of the new board is
great. All 58 people have been
placed on the various committees
and have many good ideas for
next year.”

As part of his program for next
year Mellers advocates more in-
formal use of the Student Union.
Also he feels that there should be
smooth internal communication
between the board and the vari-
ous committees and its members.
This will promote harmony and
will eliminate the problem of each
committee being only concerned
with its own problems. Further-
more Mellers believes that the
students should know more about
the activities of the SU Board.

The Special Events Committee
of this year has been eliminated
because each chairman should
work on" this in order to bring
events of a special nature to the

University and thus round out the
total SU program, according to

Mellers.

“It Goes On..."

OUTLAWINC PAUL

Apparently someone on the NCAA basketball rules com-
mittee has a personal grudge against the Panther’s Paul
Krieger. A new rule‘ invoked for next year may force Paul
to either learn how to tie his shoes or start wearing high cut
shoes. . .

‘The committee eliminated the practice of “ofﬁcial’s time
out,” for the purpose of adjusting or repairing equipment
or apparel. This change is aimed primarily at players who
wear low cut shoes which often come off, delaying the game.
Players have been suspected of deliberately losing shoes to
stop the action.

As far as being guilty, of losing low cut tennis shoes,
Krieger rates his own TV show, known aptly as “The Offend-
er.” He used to lose his shoes on the average of twice a game
——-or whatever number ‘of points Tim Grgurich scored per
game—and this created-a new game for WPGH broadcaster
Barry Weiser.

To eliminate a lull in his constant patter,‘ Weiser always
clocked Krieger while he tied his laces. We forget what the
record was. -

It may be recalled, however, that one of these shoe-
lifters was a key element in a victory this past winter.
Remember how Krieger was frantically waving for a
timeout at _Morgantown because his shoe was falling off.
If the referee hadn’t noticed the loose footwear it would.
have called for a jump ball because Krieger had been
tied up.

Instead the Panthers got the ball inbounds, and this time
Krieger was fouled and he calmly sunk two free throws, the
last'one a game-winner for the Panthers. .

The anti—tennis shoe loser rule is ‘not the only unique rule
change on the cards for next winter. There are others.-

It may take as much as 15 minutesrlonger to play a
game next year. There is now a provision calling for stop-
ping the game clock whenever .the referee blows his
whistle, for‘ any reason. ‘ ‘ —

Heretofore, the clock has run onwhile the bal.l was hand-
led or taken out of bounds for such violations as traveling,
double dribbles and many other situations. Now it will stop,"
and Cliff Fagan, secretary of the rules committee, said col-
lege games obviously will require 12 to 15 minutes more to’

  

, play.

What a year for Celtic Bob Cousy to start coaching
Boston College. Not only will he be publishing articles about

' the excessive length of college games, but he’ll be bemoaning

the 100—point_games on the schoolboy circuit.

The other major change will do away with the old
call of “forced out of bounds,” in which the player with
the ball was given ‘possession on an out of bounds play. ,

Acting on the assumption that it is impossible to force a
player out of bounds without fouling him, such a call now
will result in a personal foul on the defensive player.

Officials now will be required to handle the ball to
be thrownin from out of bounds after all violations, not
just in the forecourt as previously, to prevent scoring of
cheap baskets against unprepared defenses.

Three violations were added to the list of those calling

-A for technical fouls: having more than ﬁve players on the

.h_

court during‘ play, re-entry" of a disqualiﬁed player into the
game, and changing of a uniform member during a game.
The committee clarified the definition of an offensive
foul, specifying that whenever there is question whether an
offensive, player has possession of the ball, it should be ruled
that he does. , . K

mittee in Louisville, Kentucky during the NCAA champion-
ship games. . . , A »
He said \the committee hemmed and hawed at one.
meeting to get a rule that is already in theqrule book.
After he watched the Loyola-Cincinnati basketball game,
Doc ﬁgures the committee might consider a new rule
next year.
“They’re thinking about prohibiting a player from stay-
ing in the air for more than four seconds,” says Doc.

By MARV ZELKOWITZ _4
‘ Baseball coach Bobby Lew-
is isn’t Worried about the de-
fensive ability of his outﬁeld-
ers, but hopes their hitting

‘improves over last year.

“Their hitting can’t be any
any worse,” Lewis said.
Last year, four of the return-

ling outﬁelders collected 34 hits

in 16-1 at bats for a .211 average,

»despite Bob “Corky” Cuthbert’s

.290 mark.

Lewis said, “They should be
better hitters this year. The out-

v ﬁelders are more mature. They’ve

all been‘ hitting better this
spring.”

Averaged Only .211 Last Year

Lewis Expects Improved Hitting From Outfielders 

Cuthbert used to play second
base, but_ Lewis moved him to
the outﬁeld when he started hav-
ing trouble with his ksees. “Sec-
ond base puts a lot of pressure
on a person’s knees,” Lewis said.
“It’s tough to make the pivot.
In the outﬁeld he only has to
do straight running.”

Lewis is conﬁdent that Brian
Fisher, a.;iunior left ﬁelder, will
hit well this year, despite the
fact that he went hitless in 12
times at bat last year. Fisher

Dick Wagner is the third re-

but his hitting could use improve-

said. The center ﬁelder batted
.167 for 17 games last season.
“He hit well in the spring,

Jack Giarusso is back this

a lot ‘of action. He batted four‘

  

times last year Without a hit.

Fred Mazurek, the only new-
comer to the Panther outﬁeld,
is working for a starting berth.
“He’s pressing at bat now,” Lewis

said. “He’s trying to kill the ball,

he’ll come around.”

 ;.First Game with Syracuse April 20 

Opening day will be set back a while for the baseball team as their game with
Slippery Rock, originally scheduled for April 2, has been postponed until May 2, much to
Coach Bobby Lewis’ pleasure. This gives his club a full card from April 20 through June 15.
“We couldn’t play that game on the sixth,” Lewis said. “We’ve hardly been out-

\.

doors. The weather didn’t really break until last week.

“Another reason I’m glad we don’t have to play that game on the sixth is that my

pitchers won’t have a two week

layoff between games,” the base-

ball coach continued.
” Two Week Layoff

“Last year we hit the same
kind-of situation, and John Car-
lisle couldn’t pitch for two weeks.
When he ﬁnally did pitch, he was
wild,” Lewis said.

“A guy has to pitch once
every fourth day to be effec-
tive.” Lewis went on to explain
that a pitcher may pitch in an
intrasquad game and be effec-
tive, but, “the pressure isn’t
there. Like I said, it's not like
a. baseball game."

The baseball team opens its
season, Saturday, April 20, meet-
ing Syracuse in a doubleheader
at..Leech Farm, where the team

A will play the majority of its home

games this year.

Barry Wetzel, who lettered
last year, will not Play for
Bobby Lewis this summer be-
cause of a knee oD€1'=1“0n- "I
could have used him this sum-

Lewis said.

“Barry is the kind of guy y0_u
need on a baseball team,” Lewis
continued. “He plays the inﬁeld

V-Quarterback Found Resistance to Shift to Baseball

Fred Mazurek Disappointed b

By JIM omunu

Fred Mazurek is a sincere young athlete _who came to
college three years ago and has since learned that some men

are insincere.

As a high school senior, Mazurek was the most highly
sought-after scholastic football star in the state. About 85
college recruiters beseeched him to further his education

at their respective schools.

Promises were plentiful then,
but Mazurek has since learned
that they are not like clauses in
a' written contract.

Irresistible Forces

Mazurek, who is heir apparent
to the departed Jim Trafficant’s
quarterback- job, encountered
much diﬂiculty this year when he
decided to foresake spring foot-
ball practice in' favor of baseball.

The football coaches tried to
persuade him' to change his
mind. Finally, they relented and

’ asked him to come to grid prac-
tice on a part-time basis. But
Mazurek insisted that they hold
true their word: they told him
he could play baseball in his
junior year.

Eventually, his father, a hard-
working coal—miner in Republic,
Pa., had to visit the coaches, and
add his own weight to Fred’s
argument. _

Why Not Both?

“They say why can’t I do both,”
Mazurek said,‘ referring to his
coaches. “I told them if I played
both at the same time I’d be
mediocre in both. I’d rather ex-

cel in one. It’s pretty tough do-
ing both; I couldn’t do-it. I don’t
know how Paul (Martha) does
it.” - -
Mazurek was perturbed by
the coaches’ failure to make.
good their promise. “Every
school said the same thing,” he
said. “If you went there you
could play baseball, but they
wanted you out for spring foot- .
ball when you were a sopho-
more. ' ‘

“I ﬁgured this was a\ big uni-

versity and I was disappointed ’

when‘ I had to ﬁght just to get my
own way. After all, .they had
promised me that I could play.
Better Man Wins

“The way I told the coaches, I
said if I was good enough I ex-'
pect to’ play football. If these
other fellows show that they’re
good, they should play. If I can’t
do the job, I don’t even want to
play. But I don’t think. the~coach_-
es thought the same way.”

If the coaches don’t like his
action, could this possibly hurt
his chances in ._ the fall? Fred
doesn’t think so. “ '

“Like Litchﬁeld says. He wants
to‘ see a wide-open offense this
year. The coaches know that.
Their "jobs are in jeopardy, "so

they can’t afford to foul up any-
body if they’re good. .
Starts at Bottom

“When practice starts in the
fall I "know I’ll start at the bot
tom. I’ll have to work my way
up again, but I think I can do it.”

Mazurek is concernedabout
playing baseball because he
feels that his future may pos-
sibly lie in this sport. He says
he is too small (5-foot-10, 185-
' pounds) to even consider pro
football. ‘The Philadelphia Phil-
lies have already offered him _a
$25,000 bonus. ‘

Mazurek played in the East-
West Junior Legion game as a
scholastic star’ after batting .400
for Redstone High during his sen-
ior year. '

Prefers Baseball .

“If I would ever want to play
sports, I would want to play pro-
fessional baseball,” he said. “But
the way I’m going now I‘won’t
evencmake this team.” Mazurek
had been tabbed earlier by base-
ball”Coach Bob Lewis as the

starting centerﬁelder, but he has
been pressing too much lately.
“Look at Penn State,” he said, ..
trying to draw a parallel. ~“They
always -have some of their top
football players. out for "base-
ball. Last year, Pete Liske play-
ed baseball and he had been «
primarily a defensive specialist
on the football team. So what
did he do in the fall. He took
over as the No. 1 quarterback.”

about his rating here as a quarter-
back anyhow. He says he can ﬁt
in with Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s
conception of a wide-open offense
if given the chance to throw.

“That’s what really griped me
last year,” he said. “They got the
idea early in the season that I
couldn’t throw. So they toldme
not to. It got so that I was throw-

ing about two passes a game. Soon‘

as they put me in the game, the
other team had eight or nine
men on the line. They knew what
I was going to do. You can’t show
anything that way.

“I was ﬁve for nine passing-

against Penn State and II‘ thought
that was my best game. That was

V the _ﬁrst opportunity I had all

year to show what I can do.”

Mazurek, it seems, is disturbed
