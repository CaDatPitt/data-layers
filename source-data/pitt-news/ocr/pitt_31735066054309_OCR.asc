CAS attempts to improve advising

 

As the drop-out rate in the

‘” Faculty of Arts and Sciences contin-

ues to rise, administrators are trying
desperately to keep more of these
students by improving the quality of
advising services to CAS undergrads.

At a meeting of the FAS
Thursday, CAS (a subdivision of
FAS) administrators said many of the
students drop out because personal
stress causes them to do poorly in
their classes.

The revised advising service will
begin next semester for freshmen,
but won’t solely be geared toward
picking classes. It will also direct
unstable students toward counseling
services in the hopes of keeping them
enrolled in school.

These advisors and counselors
will help students suffering from
things like too much workload pres-

sure, relationship troubles, or the
death of a loved one to keep them _

from falling behind in their classes
and subsequently dropping out. ‘

The dropout rate for CAS stu-
dents is evenly spread over each of
their undergraduate college years
with 30 percent of drop—outs being
sophomores, and 17 percent juniors;
freshmen and seniors are tied at 26
percent each, according to Peter
Koehler, dean of CAS faculty.

However, limit-
ed resources prevent
the school from
offering the new
advising services to

are low.

“We do have a problem,” said
Koehler at the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences meeting last Thursday.
“[The College of] Arts and Sciences
has not made its enrollment goals in
the past several years, which has
begun to cut into [its] budget.”

The new advising program will

  
   
  

help the faculty members, who feel it
is too difficult to contact students and

assist them outside of the classroom. ‘

“Right now, we as faculty have
no ability to reach students and warn
them that they are on their way to an

and Philosophy of Science instructor.

SGB plans
seminar on
date rape drug

.'er.. .

   

In response to student outcry, the
Student Government Board is sponsoring
a seminar about Rohypnol.

Rohypnol, known as the “date rape
drug,” has been showing up at college
campuses all over the country.

The. Rohypnol seminar will be held
on Saturday, Nov. 23 in the Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Unionfrom ll
a.m. to 1 p.m.

“The SGB felt that this was an issue
of concern for students,” said Cyrus

V Zolghadti. “We reached a consensus that

the seminar would be beneﬁcial.”

Zolghadii and board member Valerie
Styduhar worked with Inter-Fraternity
Council President Pat Callahan and
Panhellenic President Kristen Harts to get
Mary Koch Ruiz to hold the seminar.

Ruiz works for Sexual Assault
Services and will speak about sexual
assault as well as Rohypnol.

Christa Douaihy, who works for
Sexual Assault Services, is on the execu-
tive board of Campus Women’s
Organization, and is seeking election to
the SGB, is particularly concerned about
the dangers of Rohypnol.

“I have been going to sororities and
talking about this,” said Douaihy. “It has
become a major concern in the last sever-
al weeks. Questions about what would be
done about the Rohypnol problem even

A came up at SGB’s Meet the Candidates.”

Douaihy added that women have also
informally approached her and other
members of CWO, telling them that they
had been drugged with Rohypnol.

She said that people don’t realize that
it doesn’t have to be an alcoholic drink
that the drug can be slipped into, and it
just doesn’t happen at parties either. It can
happen at some of the most popular
downtown bars and clubs.‘

Douaihy shared that a friend of hers
who doesn’t drink alcohol was a Victim of
Rohypnol drugging. Someone put the

Trial date for Oklahoma
bombing suspect pending

Around the World

WASHINGTON — President Clinton
said a humanitarian mission in Zaire
may be required. He told reporters
Friday that the U.S. should be prepared
for the prospect of committing ground
troops.

Clinton said that before he gave the
go-ahead, he would do everything in his
power to minimize the risks to U.S.
forces. Clinton explained that he wants
assurances that troops won’t have to
“shoot their way in,” and that the U.S.
wants a cease—fire pledge and assur-
ances of cooperation from both Zaire
and Rwanda. Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Republicans in
Congress have criticized President
Clinton’s plan to send 8,500 new U.S.
troops to Bosnia for a peace-keeping
mission. 1

Indiana Senator Dan Coats said the
action was one more example of what
what he calls a “seat—of-the—pants, reac-
tive foreign policy.” Coats said that
Clinton is risking American lives for ill-
defined goals. L

Clinton originally sent U.S. troops
to Bosnia for a one—year mission, but is
now saying that the job is not finished.
Coats said the lesson is that once troops
go in, “it’s verydifﬁcult to get them
out..” Associated Press

DENVER —— A trial date for Oklahoma

Lawyers began meeting with U.S.

including the trial date. McVeigh’s

attorney, Stephen Jones, said it would

BOSTON — Racial quotas are out at
Boston’s top three high schools.

The city’s school committee voted
to scrap the system due to a lawsuit
brought on by a 13-year-old white stu-
dent. Jusy McLaughlin sued after she
was denied admission to the prestigious
Boston Latin School. She was kept out
even though she scored better on the
entrance exam than 103 black and
Hispanic students who got in.

The school reserves 35 percent of
its seats for minorities.

A federal judge ordered that
McLaughlin be admitted to the school
while the lawsuit is pending. Officials
said they’1l work out a new policy
which gives access to all racial and eth-
nic groups. Associated Press

CAS t

This project, set to be tested next
semester, will target freshman stu-
dents, particularly those in math and
English classes, who are having trou-
bles. This will hopefully keep stu-
dents who suffer through a poor
semester from getting discouraged
and dropping out entirely.

“[Faculty] can use the ‘bad
semester’ as an indicator that they
ought to intervene,” said Brumble.

In his proposal, Brumble

describes how he thinks the program

will benefit students.

“One student who suffers from
depression told me that had she
received a phone call early in her bad
semester, she would not have dropped
out of school for a year and a half;
two told me they would have avoided
F’s this semester had they received
such a call early [on],” the proposal
states.

Brumble said he hopes this ser-
vice will become available for all stu-
dents, from freshmen to seniors.

The program is only available to
freshmen because CAS will be able to
handle it without hiring additional
staff.

“‘Pitt already provides so many
good support services that virtually
every student should be able to get
appropriate‘ help,” Brumble said,
referring to Pitt’s tutoring resources,
counseling facilities, and its financial
aid office. ‘

Also, Brumble said the hiring of
full-time CAS advisors (instead of
graduate students) has provided facul-
ty with more time to talk with under-
graduates who are having problems.

Delegation is Cl strength for DalMolin

Jlennifer Stine

Justin DalMolin was working in
his office last year when a visibly
upset student came to him with a
problem.

The student sent $90 to a compa-
ny that “guaranteed” scholarships to
everyone who sent in the registration

‘ fee. But when she called to get infor-

mation about her application, she
discovered that the “company” had
vanished into thin air - along with

 

DalMolin wasn’t sure what he could
do, so he made a few phone calls. After
speaking to the Better Business Bureau
and the SGB lawyer, he helped her file a
complaint with the BBB.

She got her $90 back.

Extraordinary effort? Not for
DalMolin, one of two candidates for
SGB president. He says it’s all in a day’s
work as an SGB member.

“SGB’s not just about helping stu-
dents on a broad spectrum,” he said.
“Sometimes you have to sit back and fig-
ure out how to make it easier for individ—

But DalMolin, 20, didn’t always
know how to help other students. He
came to Pitt two years ago with a desire
to get involved with something, but had
no previous experience with, or interest
in, politics.

That all changed when he found out
about the SGB’s Allocations Committee.
He said he liked the idea of -affecting so
many students ‘through one organization.

a student, you had the ability to decide
where all this money was going to,” he

Fellow board member Cyrus

said.

DalMolin said it’s all worth the effort
though. He said that what they do now
will inﬂuence future generations of Pitt
students, and he wants to be part of mak-
ing changes at Pitt. .

“If I can leave and have made a sig-
nificant impact on this University, that’s
something that I would consider an
accomplishment for the rest of my life,”
he said.

DalMolin said he thinks now is a
good time to make that impact, because
the University is in a transitional period
and that the SGB, especially the presi-
dent, has the potential to be a powerful
inﬂuence on the new administration.

Friedberg fights for simplification

Marc Friedberg is refusing to partici-
pate in the typical rhetoric— ridden cam-
paigning that is so indicative of the elec-
tion process. He says he’s offering some-
thing a bit simpler and a lot more valuable
—— results.

“A lot of people give campaign
rhetoric about communicating with the
student body, but never say how they’re
going to do it. I am,” Friedberg, one of two
candidates for Student Government Board
president, said.

According to Friedberg, the bureau-
cratic structure of the University process is
such that current SGB members do not
have the time necessary to concentrate on
the issues that are really affecting students.

He said that board members’ time is
often monopolized by the planning and
organization of student programs that
should be implemented and paid for by
departments within the University. The
result of this is that pertinent student con-
cerns are not addressed.

More important to Friedberg are what
he calls the “little things” -~ things that he
said really frustrate students such as park-
ing, registering for classes, and the overall
bureaucracy that a student has to wade

through to get anything accomplished.

“I’m not offering any grand decision
that is going to unite the entire campus.
That’s not feasible. I have a feasible plan
to put students first,” Friedberg said.

It is clear that Friedberg’s plans for the
presidency have been thought out, and he
is earnest about furthering the interests of
the student body of a University whose
alumni include his father, uncle, and older
brother. Friedberg said that undergraduate
campus involvement is what breeds this
type of strong alumni support.

Friedberg said he would begin by giv-
ing the 200 student groups on campus
more of a voice. Under his plan, each of
the eight SBG members would be respon-
sible for communicating with four student
groups a week so that in a 15-week period
each group will have been heard from
twice.

“This way students won’t be saying
that SBG does nothing. This will push the
board members to accomplish something
for them,” Friedberg said. .

He is also committed to simplifying

the allocations process so that student

groups will have access to money that is
rightfully theirs. He said that there is way
too much paperwork involved in the
lengthy process and this disenﬁanchises a
lot of groups.

“Their money gets redistributed back
into the system and eventually goes to
Student Affairs where they end up doing
things for us, and it shouldn’t be that way,”

Friedberg said.

THE PITT NEWS

Friedberg has already spear—headed
lobbying efforts for the pennanent closure
of Bigelow Boulevard, integrated Pitt into
Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1672-1676 to
institute stricter penalties for slum lords
and made innovative changes in freshman
government as an SGB member. He
adamantly asserted that any further
changes that occur must start in the SGB
office.

Friedberg said that his experience
with top levels of administration make
him the best person to lead the charge. He
currently occupies seats on both the
Senate Council and University Senate and

regularly interacts with the chancellor and
vice—chancellor.

His running mates, Brian Reimer,
Brandy Miller, Dave Eisenberg and Jen
Molluso, boast similar credentials and
each are involved in student groups rang-
ing from Pitt Pathﬁnders to Freshman
Government.

“Everything is represented  educa-
tion, allocations, recreation and communi-
cation,” Friedberg said.

Students will be able to vote for SGB
president on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and
should be sure to have both their Pitt ID
and Student Activities Card with them.

There are many professors doing
important research at universities all
over the world. If they had to be
ranked, Dr. John Mellors of Pitt’s
medical school would be among the
best.

It’s not just that the research he
is doing could become vital in the
war against HIV and AIDS, which
alone puts him at the top — his mod-
est and approachable personality
puts him over the top.

Where some researchers might
be quick to take the credit for any
findings with which their research
group is involved, he is the complete
opposite. Each time he discusses his
research work, he stresses that he
does not work alone.

In discussing the several articles
written about him and the research
in which he is involved, he says he
always makes it a point to be cau-
tious about what he says.

“Some people try to get you to
say something bad about your col-
leagues, and I don’t feel comfortable
doing that, so I’m cautious not to
give them an opportunity to do that,”
he said.

His career was not always along
the path of studying infectious dis-

 

THE PITT NEWS

eases. When Mellors was in medical
school, he was faced with a decision
about what area of medicine he was
going to study. He had narrowed it
down to a choice between cancer
and infectious diseases, and he made
his decision after an experience with
a patient.

At the time, Mellors was strong-
ly considering focusing his career in
cancer research. Then a 5-year-old
girl with leukemia made his decision
an easy one. She went into remis-
sion, only to fall victim to throat
cancer 12 years later.

“She had a huge mass on her
cheek, and it was just rotting her
face, and there wasn’t anything that
we could do to help her. I just didn’t
think I could see that on a daily
basis,” he said.

He wanted to make a difference
in research and cure the people, but
he didn’t feel he could do that while
studying cancer. He felt that his
study of infectious diseases could
not only make a difference in
research, but it would give him the
opportunity to help people.

“I chose to study infectious dis-
eases because most people would get
better. Then came AIDS,” he said.

Mellors chose not to study can-
cer because of the suffering it brings
to its victims along with the frustra-

tion researchers experience while
trying to find a cure. The irony is
that Mellors is now the director of
the UPMC AIDS Programs, and he
faces those realities everyday.

,When asked if he would rather
have studied cancer, he spoke of his
experience with the young girl and
her struggle with leukemia and
throat cancer. He replied, “No. I’ll
never forget the suffering of that lit-
tle girl. Even now, when I go to the
hospital and "see the children with
cancer, I cry, and I couldn’t handle

Pitt AIDS researcher says patients impact his work

Mellors graduated from
Dartmouth College and completed
his graduate medical study at Yale.
He came to Pitt in 1991 where, in
addition to his research with the

AIDS programs, he is an associate

professor of medicine, teaching in
both the medical school and
Graduate School of Public Health.

For the first five years after
medical school, he didn’t do any
research; he strictly took care of
patients infected with HIV and
AIDS. Mellors said he feels his
patient work in the hospitals had a
great impact on his research.

“I saw people withering away
and dying. I was spending my ener-
gy on trying to improve their quality
of life, but I realized I wanted to
improve their treatment instead,” he
said. “I would go to the literature on
how to best take care of someone
and realized the information was
vague and that more was needed.
That motivated me to do research
and try to add that lacking informa-
tion.”

Although he doesn’t get to see
patients on a regular basis anymore
because of his intensive research
work, he hopes he can get back to
treating patients soon.

leagues at the UPMC AIDS
Programs including Debbie
McMahon, Sharon Riddler,
and a staff of seven other
researchers, has found a
new therapy for patients
infected with HIV.

The team discovered
that a mixture of three dif-
ferent drugs will reduce
the HIV virus to levels that
they are unable to readily
detect for as long as a year.
The drug combination has
shown positive effects in
85 percent to 90 percent of
the individuals who have
taken it.

Even though they have
made drastic improve-
ments in AIDS research,
Mellors cautions that they
have not found a cure, but
only a method of control-
ling the disease. He does
foresee a vaccine in the
future, but still sees no
cure.

“By the end of the cen-

act irresponsibly, which
could lead to an increase in
the number of HIV cases,”
he said.

Mellors also is work-
ing with three other
researchers in the
Multicenter AIDS Cohort
Study. It is a national
study, involving four uni-
versities, in which Mellors
and his colleagues —
Charles Rinaldo, Phalguni
Gupta, and Larry
Lawrance Kingsley —-
study 2,000 HIV—infected
men.

The researchers have

found that the amount of

HIV, or viral load, in the
patient’s blood stream can
determine the time it takes
‘ for HIV to progress to full-
blown AIDS. Tracking the
viral load gives
researchers the ability to

stage the progression of

HIV, which can help them

DalMolin admits that sometimes the demands
of school and SGB get a little heavy. When he’s the
most tempted to quit, there’s someone special that
helps drag him out of the dumps and keep going:
his Dad. ,

DalMolin’s father came to the United States
from Brazil when he was 20 years old and worked
to pay his own way through college. DalMolin says
he thinks about how hard his father had it when
he’s tempted to give up.

SGB Board endorsements

SGB elections will be held this Wednesday. Since informed
voters are the best voters, The Pitt News took last Friday after-
noon to meet with all the candidates. After this meeting, the edi-
torial board got together, and today we present you with our
picks of the most promising candidates for Student
Government Board.

These represent the opinion of the majority of the editorial
board and are not the picks of any one person. Tomorrow, we
will let you know our pick for the presidential race.

Marquette Bowman was the easiest choice for The Pitt
News. A rising senior who has had four years to look around at
Pitt’s campus and student life, his energy and commitment to
the students will serve the campus well during Bowman’s term.

David Teeters was next in line. The only returning board
member, Teeter combines experience with a passion for certain
issues such as the Pitt Card, closing Bigelow, and reforming
registration that will allow him to hit the ground running.
Because he is already working on his promises, there is no
doubt about a congruence between promises and reality. .

Ryan Weidenmiller has demonstrated his ability to stay

A focused on real issues when others are caught up in rhetoric.

While his performance on stages has not always been the most
dramatic, when talking with The Pitt News, he has shown him-
self to be a thoughtful and sincere candidate, which is a quality
to be encouraged in board members. _

Brian Riemer, who is running with the aim of becoming the
business manager for the board, has shown that his candidacy
is one directed. towards a purpose. His previous involvement
with the allocations committee shows that he has spent time
learning the ins and outs of a complex system. He is an orga-
nized candidate working to make a substantive change.

David Eisenberg is the ﬁnal candidate we’d like to endorse.
Eisenberg said that he would like the SGB to be a place where
students can come without hesitation when they have problems.

i It is the opinion of this board that he, unlike so many dabbling

in politics today, is sincere.
These ﬁve candidates were standouts to The Pitt News edi-
torial board.

Informal pol

 

There are deﬁnitely some
items that do not exist that would
greatly enhance our world.

. Through a little informal polling, I

found what the public—at—large is
really yearning for. Just remember
that anybody who decides to
exploit these holes in the market
can thank me for pointing them out
(cash would be nice).

First of all, we all know that
food delivery is one of the indis-
pensables of student life. But the
public is crying out for an exten-
sion in the delivery market. What
we need is ice cream and bagel

» home delivery. OK, maybe not
 together. I don’t really think the
 market for a bagel with chocolate
5 chip cookie dough ice creamis all

that huge. But c’mon, wouldn’t it

 be great if you could call out for
* either of these two food items?

Imagine this: it’s midnight,
and you are still studying for that
killer test" you have at 9 a.m.
Suddenly you get ﬂiat craving for
ice cream. You look outside and
see icicles and swirling clouds of
snow. You are in your oldest pair of
sweat pants. So you call for deliv-
ery, and ask for a hot fudge sundae.
A short while later, it’s brought to
your door. OK, so maybe you
wouldn’t be craving ice cream
when it’s snowing out, but it’s a
good idea anyway, although per-
haps it’s not all that conducive to
healthy living.

Then there’s this problem of
walking to class when you live off

I reveals PiH's real needs

campus. The buses are crowded,
and the drivers seem to be testing
how fast they can take the corners.
Good practice for surﬁng can be
done in the bus —-— it’s amazing the

balancing ability one gains while .
hanging on to those poles-

Walking, on the other hand, takes a
bit longer, and it takes energy that
sometimes you just don’t have at
some early morning hour. So, what
we need are moving sidewalks,
like the kind in airports. They’re
like escalators, but ﬂat. It would be
perfect — you just walk out the
door, step onto the sidewalk, and it
carries you to campus. Of course, a
better idea would be to install a Star
Trek transporter in all student
apartments. Then you could trans-
port yourself directly into the class-
room where you need to be.
Lecture attendance would skyrock-
et, especially for those given at
nine in the morning.

Also for those living off-cam-
pus, a personal chef should be pro-
vided. As mothers like to point out,
it is important to eat right. And see-
ing as we are all too busy studying

to cook well all the time (meaning
more than once every couple of
months), a personal chef would
help us stay healthy. The produc-
tion of another generation of stu-
dents who have forgotten the
meaning of the words “fruit” and
“vegetable” would be prevented.
Students would be in much better
shape. Actually, this would elimi-
nate the needs for ice cream deliv-
ery and moving sidewalks. We
would all feel so much better hav-
ing all our daily vitamins and nutri-

ents that we wouldn’t be craving
odd/ foods at midnight, and we
would even get up early to enjoy
the invigorating walk to campus.
Yeah, right.

Another wish that has been

strongly voiced is for the allevia- .

tion of stress, especially during
exam weeks. What we really need
are massage therapists. A universi-
ty with a massage service would be
the most popular in the entire coun-
try. After sitting behind a computer
for several hours, working diligent-
ly on an intricate research paper
(not e-mail), a massage would be a
welcome tension relief and would
prepare you for further homework
and lectures. Yes, a massage ser-
vice would be an excellent addition
to our University. This would also
cut down on student health costs,
since there wouldn’t be so many
cases of people with shooting pains
in their shoulders from sitting
hunched over their books.

Equally unlikely, but the most
strongly expressed wish has to do
with a little time off. A fall break is
number one on the wish list of
those who responded to my poll.
So I’d just like to reiterate: a break,
we ‘need a break.

Anyway, since the above are
all not exactly priorities of either
Pitt or the city at large, I guess we’ll
just have to settle for reality. But
don’t worry, Thanksgiving is fast
approaching, and the parental units
will provide edible food that will
be a weloome_contrast to the smell
of a roommate’s burned rice.

tious or sarcastic.

The Pitt News is an
embarrassment

On Thursday, Nov. 14, 1996, The
Pitt News released an article titled,
“White boys look at black boys who
pose as daegos.” The article focused on
Afro-American rap artists who model
their lyrics, styles, and album titles after
notorious members of the organized
crime society. However, the term “dae-
gos” was never deﬁned to a specific
group of the Italian culture, and there-
fore could be interpreted as representing
the entire Italian community. Not only
was the term misspelled, but also used
out of context. If the headline was equal
in grammatical context, it would have
been written with the slang term for all
three racial communities in the main
title (not to say that any use of deroga-
tory terms is correct and/or permissi-
ble). However, the only member
acknowledged by this statement was the
Italian commu-
nity. Such
b e h a v i o r
should not and
will not be tol-
erated.

remarks in his interview with you.
Despite his assertion to the con-
trary, Ulery is well—acquainted with
efforts to organize graduate students.
During his election, he sought from
the Graduate Student Political Action
Network our endorsement. A former
GSPAN officer, I was present at the
meeting with Ulery, and I can tell you
that we discussed the issue of union-
ization with Ulery at that time, offer-
ing conditional support. We suspected
that Ulery, in the fashion of ambitious
politicos everywhere, told us what he
thought we wanted to hear; we did
not endorse him. While the
Committee to Organize Graduate
Students is a new and separate orga-

nization, various persons are active in

both.

As a funded graduate student

can tell you that the stipend is not

Not only has-The Pitt News become an
embarrassment to journalism in general
and to the University of Pittsburgh as a
whole, but its writers have too often
shown the utmost display of ignorance
towards many issues. From this point
on, they should be educated in the areas
in which they decide to write.

The Pitt News is a representation of
an institution of higher learning and
therefore, should include material
which reﬂects the intelligence of its
readers, rather than its own individual
ignorance. As a result of the unprofes-
sionalism displayed in this “so-called”
paper, the ﬁnal guidelines that deter-
mine what material is and is not pub-
lished should be more aware of its
actions. We will accept nothing less
than a formal, written apology to the
members of all Italian origins, as well as
the members of the human race as a
whole.

The article
noted that
Ulery seems to

interests of the administration in
mind. This comes as no surprise to
me, as Ulery came to office with the
formal endorsement of the dean of the
business school, Mr. Zoffer, who, in a
memo on his official letterhead, urged
business school students to vote for
him. Our University’s fine grievance
procedures —— which I utilized — did
not rule this blatant subversion of stu-
dent democracy to be an infraction. I,
and other members of the Student
Action slate (I stood for business
manager), asked during the election
how effective an advocate for gradu-
ate and professional students’ inter-
ests Ulery could be, given the formal
support of the administration. His
trivialization of unionization efforts
shows him to be disinterested in the
needs of students, but attuned to the
wishes of administrators. The tone
and content of his remarks show that
he wishes to forestall, not facilitate,
the efforts of graduate students to use
their rights to‘ organize and to
improve their conditions and the

quality of instruction here at Pitt.

“Experience is what you get when
you don’t get what you want” —-
American Proverb.

Once again this dictum proves as
true as ever. What I am thinking of in this
respect is last Thursday’s Spectrum head-
line, “White boys look at black boys who
pose as daegos.” What I wanted was a
satirical headline that would catch the
eye and make people think about ethnic
slurs. What I got was the experience of
people being outraged.

So, I guess I owe some people an
apology.

I’d like to apologize to my staff for
all of the ﬂak they’ve taken as a result of
this headline. Especially to our advertis-
ing representative who had to endure a
diatribe from one of the advertisers. I am
sony. It is not your fault that she didn’t
know where to direct her anger.

It was suggested to me by folks who
know me that I write a satirical apology
and talk about how this headline was part
of a grand scheme that has been in the
works for months — that my reason for

- studying the Classics and Ancient Rome

and hiring an Italian managing editor and
working with an Italian business manag-

' er was all part of an evil plot to debase an

entire culture. Yet, if I have learned any-
thing, it is that satire is a dead art form.
People either get terribly offended or see

the satirical portrait as something to be '

emulated.

Apology comes from the Ancient
Greek word, octcoitoytoc, which is actual-
ly a defense, as in court. Here, then, is my
ocrtokoytoc. .

When the headline was written, it
was after a lot of discussion. First of all,
the headline was supposed to be poking
fun at the writers of the reviews. The idea
was that the writers are a couple of nerdy
white kids who are writing about gangs-
ta rap even though they can’t hope to
appreciate it properly. Since lots of music
reviewers are guilty of this same practice,
we thought we’d just come right out and
admit it.

“Black boys who pose” — the idea
here is that Snoop and Tupac, two suc-
cessful adult musicians whose strong
identities are well known, are acting like
kids playing make-believe in pretending
to be someone else. It never occurred to
me —— until after it was pointed out —
that ‘boys’ could have negative connota-
tions for African American men because,
being from the Detroit area, I don’t think

 

of them in this way. _
“Pose as daegos” was supposed to be

irony. Francis Ford Coppola is one of the.

most brilliant ﬁlmmakers of the past 25
years; Machiavelli is arguably the most
brilliant, certainly the most proliﬁc, polit-
ical scientist of the Renaissance. Calling
them “daegos” is trying to say that their
only important characteristic is that they
are Italian — which is clearly not true,
hence the satire. Yes, there are some

Italians today who ﬁnd “daego” a truly‘

offensive word; my hope was that by
using it, we would focus on the tangle of
ethnicity involved in these reviews.

One of the lessons that has come out
of this is that there is a danger in group
thinking. While things can make sense at
the time among a select group of people,

once that is carried out into the larger

world, the implications are not always
the same. After all, the person whose pri-
mary responsibility is to keep me from
being stupid (read: my managing editor)
was busy spelling “daego” (just that way)
for me.

So, The Pitt News gets a learning
experience instead of kudos for being
creative. This is unfortunate for us. But I
would also like to take this opportunityto
thank the people who came up to speak
with me reasonably about what was
printed. One fellow, who is only a second

generation American, explained his situ-

ation to me and how the headline seemed
to him and people he knew. To him, I say
thank you for trying to make me under-
stand and working with me to make
things better.

To those who refused to even hear an
explanation or talk to me about what had
happened, there is little to say. If you are

« so unreasonable as to not be able to even

discuss what bothers you, if you are
unwilling to go beyond a headline, and
are unwilling to let people learn from
mistakes, then good riddance.- We don’t
need you reading the paper in any event.
The last thing we need is a readership of
bigots.

Two more notes of thanks: to the fel-
low who came ' in after someone had
threatened to “throw [my] ass through a
wall” in order to sign a petition against
The Pitt News; thanks for telling me not
to take it personally. I appreciate that you
could condemn the headline and not the
people who made a mistake in printing it.
Finally, Marisa Pedulla, your note
arrived in the middle of all this mess.
Thank you, it was a bright point in an
otherwise very dark day.

Benjamin Jackson is the Editor-in-Chief _

of The Pitt News.

“It’s a great tradition and a lot of
memories,” said Tagliabue. “I grew
up cheering for Johnny Lujack, Ralph
Guglielmi, and Leon Hart as a young
kid in New Jersey. It’s great to be
back here and see it first—hand and
feel it first—hand. Its a special day.”

It was a special occasion for the
hundred—plus campers, mobile homes,
and blue-and—gold—painted school
buses that blanketed the parking lot to
the west of the stadium. Students and
alumni mingled amongst autos, their
socialization aided by enough spirits
to inebriate downtown Dublin. This
from the same campus that was virtu-
ally vacant at 11:00 the previous
night.

To the east of the stadium,
Touchdown Jesus appeared unfazed.

Notre Dame fans still loved their
neighbors, no matter where they were
congregated. Among the RV paradise
and blaring Irish fight songs, the par-
ents of Pitt defender John Jenkins

’ soaked up the ambience. In the regu-

lar parking lot, Pitt alum Steve
Buchman pondered South Bend’s
place in college football lore. _
“Even if you hate Notre Dame,
which [I] do,” said Buchman, “the tra-
dition is something to live through, to
respect  to enjoy, actually. This is
what college football is all about.”
Buchman attended his first col-
lege game when Pitt visited Notre
Dame in 1989. In between expressing
his respect and awe for the Irish mys-
tique, he praised the fansf behavior.
‘‘I haven’t been harassed,” said
the former Pitt basketball manager.
“No one’s said anything.”
Buchman is a 1995 graduate and
arrived at the game with, 1994 grad
Dave Kiehl and Jason Bostocky, who

gave his college status as a dubious
“Class of 1996. Winter. Probably.”

The parking lot parties gradually
closed down in the hour before game
time, as the fan mass made its way
toward what may be the smallest
59,000—seat stadium in human history.
Fans were crammed within inches of
either end zone, while the late arrivers
at the ticket window stood around the
top of the bleachers.

Well, almost the top. Construction
to expand the stadium, expected to be
finished by 1997, encircled the top of
the old building with unfinished lev-
els of white concrete. The empty
upper level made it look like the fans
decided to cram themselves into the
tight spaces of the lower level.

If given the choice, the fans prob— I

ably would have squeezed in anyway.
The crowd acted in unison for most of
the game, starting with a massive ren-
dition of “The Star—Spangled Banner”

 

that nearly outdid the ensuing military
jet ﬂyover.

The ﬂyover went west to east, like
they were preparing to execute a
bombing run on Touchdown Jesus.
Talk about not making sense.

As for the game itself, Irish faith-
ful behaved like they were in atten-
dance at a Catholic mass. On cue,
after every one of the many Notre
Dame kickoffs, they would scream
“Go  Irish!” in perfect harmony. The
Irish players didn’t need to cue fan
involvement —— any time Pitt faced a
crucial third down or was pinned deep
in Panther territory, the stadium erupt-
ed. And after every touchdown, from
the first shocking punt return to Kevin
Carretta’s first—ever career score late

in the fourth quarter, the cheers shook

both the old and newly—constructed
rafters.

Fans continued to cheer as the
Notre Dame tradition was employed
to the dismay of the Panther faithful

in attendance: Allen Rossum broke a
season record for kick-return touch-
downs that was first set in 1965, the
Irish punt—return corps broke a record
for yards. in a game set in 1926
against Beloit College, and the 40
points scored in the second quarter
came within two of the team record,
when the Irish victimized poor little
St. Viator in 1912.

The mostrevealing fan reaction
came early in the fourth quarter,
when the entire stadium fell silent for
an Indiana State Police announce-
ment about safe driving. Afterwards,
they screamed in mock fright.

The last fan explosion was for the
band, whose extensive post-game
performance brought out all the
Notre Dame cheers, except for
“Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!”

Ryan Gee, a.k.a. the Notre Dame
Leprechaun, pointed out the band’s
significance.

“It’s not just about the game,”
said Gee, a junior. “It’s the whole
show — it’s the band,‘ the cheerlead-
ers, the Irish Guard

 

it’s a full‘

 

weekend.”

Fan solidarity broke only once,
when a few chants of “Lou, Lou,
Lou,”.seeped through the band’s last
number_as Coach Holtz ran off the
field. Mystique wasn’t on Holtz’s
mind after the contest,»a's he dodged
questions concerning his possible
resignation. Even so, while he danced
around media with stories of mon-
key—grinders, he made a few remarks
about the South Bend tradition he
may soon be departing. »

“I have nothing but the utmost
respect for Notre Dame and its lead-
ership,” said the coach. “I see a great

E future for Notre Dame. No one can

love this University more than I do. I
don’t think it’s that big a deal
whether I stay or whether I go 
Notre Dame is going to continue to
exist.”

If you’re any kind of college
sport fan, you have to hope so. Even
if you don’t understand why. '

Like Commissioner Tagliabue
said before ducking into the stadium,
“The mystique is real.’’

SOUTH BEND, Ind., — Pitt’s
men’s and women’s swimming and
diving teams traveled to Notre
Dame with more realistic chances
of defeating the Fighting Irish than
the football team.

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team raised their season
record to 4-1 after they sunk the
Irish 180-115 Friday evening.
Several Pitt swimmers tore apart
the waters at Rolfs Aquatic Center.

Brian Elko participated in the

winning 200 medley relay
(1234.86), with Andy Cherup,
Jonathan Haggerty, and Jerry

Koller. Elko also captured first-
place finishes in the 100-backstroke
(51.41) and the 100-butterfly

(51.46).
“We knew that Pitt was one of
the best teams in the conference,”

said Notre Dame swimmer Matt
Rose, who was found tailgating at
the football game. “We really hoped
to do a lot better.”

Rose didn’t fare too poorly. He
and diver Herb Huesman were the
only winners for the Irish. Rose
won the 100-breaststroke, and
Huesman won the one-meter dive.

Pitt had several double winners.
Koller also won the 200-freestyle
(l:44.42). Regan Drew claimed the
1000-freestyle (9233.90) and 500-
freestyle (4:42.92). Finally, Eric
Stefanski won both the 50-freestyle
(21.51) and, by five seconds, the
200—backstroke.

Preston Hammontree’s 1:54.70
time in the 200-butterfly was good
enough for first place. Bob Nooning
won the 100—freestyle with a time
of 47.89, and Scott VanEpps fin-
ished first in the 200-breaststroke
with a time of 2:10.28.

Things did not go quite as well

for Coach Marian Cassidy’s
women’s team. Notre Dame never
trailed in the meet as they claimed
every diving event.

Nikki Clifford said, “We were
really surprised. Our strengths are
in the shorter races, but [Linda]
Gallo swam an awesome 1000
free.”

Gallo outdueled one of Pitt’s
finest swimmers, Samantha
Chabotar, in both the 500—freestyle
and 1000-freestyle. Courtney Smith
won the 100- and 200-freestyle,
while freshman Shannon Suddarth
won the 200-breaststroke and 400-
individual medley.

Pitt’s lone winner was Jaime
Tomazich, who crushed the field on
the one-meter and three-meter div-
ing boards.

There’s no rest for either team,
as they head to the Indiana
Invitational on Thursday.

plete. Notre Dame’s attempted fake
field goal was denied when holder

‘Hunter Smith’s shuffle pass to Bert

Berry was snuffed by linebacker
Ernest Coakley at 14: 48. Following
the ‘defensive stop, the smell of
upset was in the air, as the Pitt Band
blared the Panther fight song.

That drive proved to be one of
the last in which Notre Dame would
be denied the end zone. Following a
Panther drive that featured Pitt run-
ning back Billy West, Pitt was
forced to punt at 12:45 of the sec-
ond quarter, the beginning of Pitt’s
downfall. Punter Nate Cochran's
low boot was fielded by Allen
Rossum who caught the ball in full

 

stride and broke two Panther tack-
les, running down the right sideline
for a 55-yard touchdown return.
Cochran failed to play safety on the
play, as Rossum blew past him at
the 25-yard line. Rossum’s touch-
down was the first of three punt
returns for Irish touchdowns in the
second quarter.

Following a three-and-out series
for the Panthers, the Irish took over
possession at 11:20. Fullback Jamie
Spencer capped off an 80-yard Irish
drive with a 40-yard burst past Pitt
defensive backs Darrell Whitmill
and John Jenkins for a Notre Dame
touchdown. Following a missed
extra point, the Irish led 13-0.

 

Notre Dame began another scor-
ing drive at 8:32 following another
three-play-and-out series by Pitt.

“We needed to sustain a drive,
and we didn’t,” Lytle said after the
game.

Highlighted by a 37-yard pass
from Powlus to flanker Shannon
Stephens, backup tailback Robert
Farmer blasted over the goal line for
a touchdown at 6:31. Notre Dame
failed to convert a two—point con-
version but still led 19-0.

Following Pitt’s third straight,
ineffective drive, Rossum once
again broke through a. seam up the
middle and outran the Panther spe-
cial teams for an 83-yard punt

return touchdown, pushing Notre
Dame’s lead to 26-0.

On Cochran's next punt, with
Rossum still catching his breath
from his previous touchdown,
Denson took over the punt return
duties. It was a different player but
the same result, as Denson broke
through a wave of Panther players
and ran 74 yards for another Notre
Dame touchdown.

Notre Dame’s third and final
punt return for a touchdown made
the game a laugher at 33-0.

“The punt returns took the wind
out of our sails,” safety John
Jenkins said. “After that, they could
do what they wanted.”

With the score 33-0 and Pitt
sinking fast, Panther’s quarterback
Lytle’s interception at 4:07 fueled
another Irish score. Powlus took the
ball over at the Notre Dame 36-yard
line before lofting a pass to a wide-
open Bobby Brown for a 49-yard
completion. A two-yard touchdown
sprint by Randy Kinder ballooned
the Notre Dame score to 40-0 at the
half. '

The second quarter marked sev-
eral history—making performances

' for the Fighting Irish.

- Rossum became the first play-
er in school history to return four
returns (punt and kickoff) for touch-
downs in a season. .

0 Notre Dame’s three punt
returns for touchdowns in the quar-
ter tied the school-record for returns

, in a season.

- The 40 points were the most
the school ever scored in a quarter.

- The 231 punt return yards in .

the first half set a single-game
record.

The second half featured a
majority of second string players for
both sides. The lone Panther- score
came on a perfectly timed 32-yard
fade to wide receiver Jake Hoffart
from backup quarterback Pete
Gonzalez. Besides Lytle and
Gonzalez, quarterback Darnell
Dinkins played two snaps, and
freshman Tony Zimmerman finished
the game.

After the game, Holtz had noth-
ing but positives to say about Pitt,
despite the lopsided score.

“Pitt is a vastly improved team,”
Holtz said. “Johnny Majors is a
great coach, and [the team] is on
their way back.” ~

Holtz was typically low key
about his own.team’s performance.

“We’re not a great team, but
we’re a solid team,” Holtz said.

The /Panthers now have two
weeks off before they take on the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the sea-
son finale on Nov. 30.
