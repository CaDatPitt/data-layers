‘Unusual Number of Late
Applications Cause of
Expected Decrease

An estimated decrease of from ﬁve
to ten per cent in freshman enroll-
ment was indicated this morning as
freshmen and upperclassmen entered
their second day of registration at
headquarters in the Cathedral of
Learning. An unusual number of late
applications, according to Registrar
J. G. Quick, is responsible for the
anticipated decrease. ‘

Although decreased enrollments in
other institutions outside Pittsburgh
would serve to indicate an increase
here in the number of transfer stu-
dents, Registrar ,,Q';uick stated yea-
terday that no uiiusual increase had
been noted in the transfer enrollment.
Deﬁnite ﬁgures on the number of
regularly enrolled upperclassmen were
noet available from the oﬁice of the
registrar this week.

Members of the class of 1936 were
the first to invade registration "head-
quarters as the flow of incoming stu-
dents to the seventh and eighth floors
of the. Cathedral began yesterday
morning.
Business Administration, Engineering
and Mines, with pre-dental and pre-
-medical students, registered from nine
until 12 o'clock yesterday; In addi-

‘tion to these, freshmen in the survey
section, mid-year engineering fresh-
men, and sophomores in-the pre-den-
tal and mines divisions kept regis-
tration ofﬁcials busy until after four.
o'clock in the afternoon.

The estimated decrease in fresh-
man registration would ‘ place the
number of incoming ﬁrst year'stu-
dents somewhere betw_een 1093 and
1153, as compared with last year's
freshman~ enrollment of 1,214. This
does not include the ‘freshman en-‘
rollment. from the three off-campus
centers, where last September 248
freshmen were registered in courses
of the University. " , _

The change of the -scene of regis-
tration activities jrom Syria Mosque
to the upper levels of the Cathedral
of Learning will not impair the em-
ciency of the registration staff and is
not expected to cause over-crowded
conditions. the registrar explained.
Students, throughout theweek, will
he admitted in limited groups at half-
hour intervals, the procedure followed
_:in previous years at Syria Mosque.

Elevators carrying students from
the -ground _to the eighth floor will
maintain a steady ﬂow into the build-
ing. From the eighth ﬂoor all stu-
dents will be directed to their section
advisers in the several rooms re-
served for the schools. The line
then ﬁlters down one flight of stairs
into the section division in Room 728,
and from there passes through Room
725 into the writing section in Room
717. .

Rome, Activities Transfer
To Eighth Floor

an-an-a———-—-j

Staffs of the three campus publi-
cations and the musical and dramatic
organizations this week. were_prepar-
ing to abandon their offices in Activ-
ities Building for new quarters adja-
cent to the office of the dean of men
in Room 801, Cathedral of Learning.

The .tna.usfer of activities, planned
for today, was postponed late yester-
day until sometime next week so the
movement would not interfere with
registration.

The exodus of the publications from
the DeSoto street "Y" Hut is but part
of a general transfer of all activities

"and" many department headquarters

into the Cathedral, John Weber, Uni-
versity business manager, explained
yesterday. .

Transfer of the entire staff of the
office of the dean ‘of men, was effected
late last week. Walter Rome, assist-
ant dean of men; Theodore Biddle,
assistant to the dean of men; Ches-
ter Bennett, director of the Univer-

sity -employment bureah, "and 7’:3ami'1el"'

Strauss, business manager of the In-
ter-fraternity Cooperative Buying As-
sociation left" their offices in Room
210 State Hall Thursday for the new
home on the eighth .floor of the
Cathedral. ' p

A total of 171 classes offrom two
to six hours each, with a total class

enrollment of" 5,900 students, will be

heldthis semester In the Cathedral,

Weber revealed in announcing trans-
fers to the new University center.
This is an actual enrollment of ap-
proximately~ 2500 different under-
graduates who will be attending
classes on the seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth and eleventh ﬂoors of the
Cathedral. '

The Panth.er, Owl and Pitt Weekly,
with the offices afﬁliated with the
dean of men’s headquarters, t:'a.CI_1 will
occupy a reserved section in Room
801, the back wing of the Cathedral
facing Belleﬁeld street and file new
Mellon Institute. M ’

Transfer of the ofﬁces and equip-
ment of the military department from
their old offices on O’Hara street to
the eleventh ﬂoor of the Cathedral
was completed early last; week.

Other transfers to the Cathedral
since the closing of school in June in-
clude the removal of the staff of the
Research Bureau of Retail Training
from its old building on Fifth avenue
to the eleventh ﬂoor, and the trans-
fer of the botany department from its
headquarters in Zoology Main——-now
demolished to make ,way for land-
scaping of the Cathedral grounds—
to the tenth ﬂoor. -

A complete directory of Cathedral
of Learning oﬂices. and rooms being
occupied this semester will be printed
in the ﬁrst issue of the new semi-
weekly publication, appearing on the
campus next Tuesday.

Three Pitt Graduates Get ,
Fellowships for Research

 

. Milton Plessett, Isadore Amdur, and
Robert. L. Martin, three former Pitt
students,‘ were signally honored this
-year by the National Research Coun-
cil which awarded to each of them a
fellowship. at a nationally-known uni-
_ versity. . . '

Each fellowship is for $1600, to be
used this year; and under its terms
the student who receives it must
carry on research on a particular sub-
ject in his ﬁeld. To be eligible for a.
fellowship, a. student must possess a
Doctor of Philosophy degree
, equivalent‘. -

The National Research Council was
formed by the Rockefeller Foundation
and holds $125,000 forithe purpose of
providing fellowships to deserving
students throughout the--country. It
is made up of a committee of distin-
guished scientists and educators who
pass on the right of students to the
awards. The‘ committee attempts to

distribute the fellowships to as many
different universities‘ as possible. An

 

or its '

applicant for a fellowship takes no
examination, but the , committee
studies his record and recommenda-
tions that have been sent in attest-
ing to his ability.

Of the applicants, Ple-ssett obtained
his Master of Science degree from
Pitt in 1930 and his Doctor of Philoso-
phy from Yale in 1932. He is going
.to the California Institute of Tech-
nology where he will do research
work in the ﬁeld of quantum mechan-
ICS. ' ' -

Isadore‘Amdur entered Pitt in 1927
and obtained_ his Doctor of Philosophy
degree from Pitt in 1932. Amdur will
study at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. . ‘

Robert L. Martin took his-Bachelor
of Science in Mathematics degree at
Pitt in 1929. and his Doctor of Philo-
sophy degree at California Institute
of Technology in 1932. He will spend
the ﬁrst half of the year at Rice In-
-stitute, Texas, and the second half
at Harvard University. . V

The Pitt Weeklly is Dead!

Long Live The Pitt Weekly!

Withethis issue, The Pitt Weekly,
published regularly since October 5,
1910,‘ becomes a new ‘official student
publication on the University campus.
In spite of thedepression, talk of hard
times, and general despo_ndency over
ﬁnancial conditions, and probable" cur-

- tailment of student activities, thenew
- student publication will

appear’ on
the campus twice each week, on
Tuesday and- Friday morning.

The size ‘of the new semi-weekly,
has not been materially decreased.
Instead of being published as an
eight-columned paper as last year,
the new paper is to appear as a
seven-columned paper, but with slight-
ly greater width. : _ - _

There has been growing feeling on
the campus "for several years for. ‘a
paper. to more, adequately. fjcover" the.
campus. It has been felt that the
time between issues from week to
week has been too great to allow
most of the news to remain as news.
So after much discussion of budget,
expenses, and news sources during
the week, the Board of Publications
has approved the publication of a.
seml—weekly ‘on the campus. ‘

With no successor as yetnamed to

it was announced this week by John

to supervise all non-athletic activities.

In announcing plans for the dean’s

efficiency in assuming the duties of
both offices and in giving to each its
full measure of attention. He said: j

“Mr. Rome has done aisplendid job
in the fulﬁllment of his duties in the

Organization of a cheering. sec-

Schools of Engineering», Mines

week by William“ E, Brinker, .
cheer leaders’ coach.

No other students save those in
the above groups, all of, whom
will have their registration'c_ards
stamped during registration, will
be admitted to the cheering sec-

was made, because they were or-
ganized and could _be reached
with the least trouble at any time.
Students in the College and .
School of Administration will not
be permitted to sit in the cheer-
ing section.

Possibility of their inclusion in
this group at a later date was in-
dicated, contingent upon the or-

1 Women ’s Earnings Decline   D 
 Almost 100% During Yeairjltp

 ?—

“Although the outlook for this year
is naturally even less bright than last
year's-, those students who must be
eitheripartly or wholly self-supporting
may ﬁnd some promise in the fact that
individual earnings of women students
last year went as high as" four hun-
dred and ninety-eight dollars,” ac-
cording to_Isabe1 Anderson, women's
employment and housing ‘director.
“The gross average,” says Miss An-
derson, “was however somewhat less
than ﬁfty dollars, since
ranged from eighty-ﬁve cents to the
four hundred and ninety-eight dollars
top’)!

Decrease Almost 100 Per Cent

Women students grossed thirty-nine
thousand two hundred and twenty-two
dollars during the school year 1931-

sor of chemistry; Walter Rome, as-
sistant dean of men; and Theodore

ous university activities. ,_

camp includes John B. Holbrook,
chairman; James Danahey, Col, ’34;

and no difficulty whatever has been
experienced soifar in signing-up the
‘social and professional fraternities
that are in good standing.

Strauss, as business manager, -will

manner of making fraternity pur-
chases. The fraternity‘ steward‘ will
order direct from the ﬁrms selected
by the Association, ‘exactly as in the
past. It will not be necessary for the
fraternities to purchase in larger
quantities. than they-formerly did.’ ' Al-
though dealing in awholesale market
the Association has arranged t6 have
the fraternities_ well serviced.

The oﬂice of the Association has re-
quested that the' fraternities _do not
make any separate contracts for main
tenance’ supplies though several con-

thepfraternity business.  .
The dealers’. will present their bills
to the fraternities directly, but the
bills must be paid through the office
of the Association, located in Room
801 of the Cathedral of Learning.
this way the Association can best
check on price lists, etc. The Cooper-
ative Buying Association‘ will receive‘
the discounts and will make the re-
funds to the fraternities. In order to
receive all of the discount, the fra-
ternities must settle their accounts
within ten ‘days after the bills are ren-
dered. Half the discount will be re-
mitted from the 10th to the 15th and
the discount deducted from bills paid
‘after that time. ‘
,A cooperative buying scheme‘ at the
University of Oregon saved $14,000

year; a similar plan at the University
of Minnesota saved $10,000.‘ Strauss
believesthat the Pitt plan will effect
at least a 10 per cent saving in main-
tenance costs, which may possibly
amount to $5,000 or more saved dur-
ing the coming year. Expenses of the
Association willbe paid with funds de-

ducted from the discount savings at-

Health Service

- Organiiation Located In

Falk Clinic; Gives
Free Assistance

(Continued From Page One)
pear at the Falk clinic.

Each incoming freshman has been
presented with a health notebook in
which is kept his complete health
history and physical examination
record. From time to time he will
be‘expected to make certain addi-
tions to the contents of the book,
and so will be required to keep it
available at all times. The notebook
is intended to_ make students health
consgious. The physical examination
probes into every phase of the stu-
dent's health and takes more than an
hour to make.

will Operate Full Time ’

The health service will undertake
to administer treatment at the Falk
clinic, but it will treat no cases at
the patient’s home. The service
does“ not propose to take the place
of the"-family physician. Differing
from the previous Pitt health service,
the present service will operate on
full time and will be prepared to
handle cases as they come in. -All
members of the Falk Clinic staff,
comprising many of the city’s best
physicians, will be available.

In case of accident or illness, stu-
dents will be expected to notify the
health service immediately so that

the proper therapeutic measures. can
be started quickly. In cases where
students _are unable to come to the
office——for instance. where students
are living away from home and be
come ill—-hospital treatment may be
advised. In such cases, parents" and
family physicians will be notiﬁed at

once. The University will not as-
sume responsibility for hospital
charges. It is likely that if a student

should become ill at a fraternity
house, the health service will under-
take treatment for the case though
this has not deﬁnitely been decided
as yet.
Certify All Excuses

All students who are ill should
notify the health service office in
order that the cause of absence may
be communicated to the proper dean
of the University. Excuses for ab-
sence from class on account of ill-
ness will be certiﬁed by a member
of the staff of the health service.
This certiﬁcate may be obtained by
reporting in person with a statement
from the ‘attending physician.

No permanent excuses from physical
examination will be granted. Cer-
tiﬁcates of illness requiring tempo-
rary absence from the classes will be
issued by the health service. Ex-
tensions on these excuses may be
granted when applied for in person.

Dr. ‘Carlson desires to have the
student consult the health service
physicians concerning illness or-
problems of health, physical or
mental, regardless of how difficult or
intimate these may be. '

The health service has been the
subject of considerable agitation by
student council, the Pitt Weekly, and
other centers of student opinion in

-previous. years. It was felt that Pitt
had an inadequate health service. At
a special election last spring the
question of whether or not to im-

0 prove the Pitt health service was de-
cided by a student vote.

By FRANK C. “JAP” STEWART
First Editor of the Pitt Weekly. C
Frank C. “Jap” Stewart, first editor of the Pitt Weekly, is new
with the Cleveland Press, as its state editor. During his ‘six years
with this paper he has also been night editor, and assistant city
editor. ' . -
So the Pitt Weekly is going “twice a week.” . __ ' . '
That stirs the same kind of a thrill that goes with the ﬁrst pair
of long trous'ers——or the young son ’s. ﬁrst trip to the polls ‘as a voter.
The goodold VVeekly is growing up in the journalistic. world.
It brings back a lot of memories to me——-back to a time‘ when
there was no Weekly. . i , ‘ -
The night that Karl Davis and I sat on the porch of the old Phi
Zeta Phi house——now the\ active chap- ‘ _
ter of «Phi Gamma -Delta.—and we de- "
cided the hour had struck for the
creaky -old “'Courant”—the Univer-

E 0" camp‘-'5 5 °°”t5 3 °°PY3 $150 3 Year‘ By M3“! $1‘-"5 The ﬁrst issue of the Pitt Weekly, a single sheet, announcing the fur- _.
ther publication of an “official student publication" at the University of 7 
Pittsburgh, has unfortunately been lost. The facsimile below presents the )
first regular Pitt Weekly, as published October 5, 1910. ’ . ‘ -
The present size of the new semi-weekly publication gives an idea as to _
the growth of the “official student publication” at the University since the .‘.
-birth of the Pitt Weekly, 22 years ago. Then the paper was published as a,~_..-- .-
four-page publication, with. a circulation of less than a fourth of the presenitill I
5,000 circulation of the Weekly. ' y ' 
Too,.with only a staff of six students, as compared to the staff of fifty4

working on the Pitt Weekly last year, the paper conﬁned itself'to thegathr -- .
ering of only the larger news happenings on the campus, with additional 
news from a few of the many departments and offices. - ‘ _ - ‘ ‘

' Such capable methods of meeting the economical demands of the group might
’ well be incorporated into other phases of fraternity life.

i ACH succeeding class coming_to college is of fascinating interest because
of its potential value; the college life for— the next succeeding years will
largely be affected by the material in this group. Pitt-will beggonly what you
‘make it. Teachers, laboratories, traditions, and rooms will be here for you,_
as they have been for the others before and will be for the hundreds after
you. _ ' -
But they can avail little unless you give whole-heartedly and freely to
the development which you should expect and to which you are entitled.
Scholarship cannot be thrust upon you; you must study; the publications,
debating, orchestra, . glee clubs, band, dramaticsi, or athletic teams cannot
succeed with on-lockers-only. Your class must furnish its fullshare of par-
ticipants. From your ﬁrst day make up your minds to accomplish some-
thing. . ‘ - _ I
You would do well to bear in mind those verses by John Oxenham:

“To every man there openeth
A way, and ways, and the Way,
And the high soul takes the high way
The low soul takes the low, ‘ 1
And _in between on the misty ﬂats
The rest drift to and fro. ’
But to every man there openeth
A high way and a low way
And every men decideth
, The way his soul shall go.”

You will ﬁnd it easy to drift aimlessly through pleasant days here. To
make the University of Pittsburgh, and yourself of use to the University, you

need a clear purpose and a high goal, for “not failure, but low aim, is cri1ne.” '

You will ﬁnd us all ready and willing to help. Faculty, ofﬁcers, upper-
classmen, are "one in their desire that the University is the best possible place
in which to work and play; to grow strong spiritually, intellectually, and
physically; and you, we know, are coming with this same spirit.

Welcome to the University of Pittsburgh, class of 1936!

UFFICIENT evidence to justify the continued existence of Student Coun-

cil exists today in the full time student health service recently organized
with headquarters in the Falk Clinic and Dr. H. C. Carlson, basketball coach,
as its director. _ _ ' -

' For it was Student Council, and one of its members in particular, who
last semester conducted an investigation of the health service on the campus
and found it hopelessly inadequate. Acting on the .results of its investiga-
tion Council petitioned the University administration for more adequate facil-
ities for handling the health needs of the undergraduate body. The fact that
thedesired improvement was not effected‘ until after the closeof the school
yearin no measure detracts from the credit due Student Council and Reed
P. Rose, Dent. '33, chairman of the investigating committee.

The investigation conducted by Rose and his committee disclosed that

located, but was inadequate in point of personnel, equipment, size of quarters
and number of hours devoted daily to receiving and treating student patients.

It is Well to point out that the results of that investigation were in no
sense a reﬂection on the work carried on in past years by Dr. E. M. Frost,
for hiswas not a full time position as men’s health director. The natural
limitations of his working time, the inadequate quarters assigned for his use,
and the lack of funds combined to prevent him from instituting such a pro-
gram as is now being carried out under the direction of Dr. Carlson. Chair-
man Rose, throughout the investigation, had the full cooperation and the
personal endorsement of Dr. Frost. ‘

3 Today’s full time health service, while not the ultimate in such facilities-,
is a far cry from the old “health” dispensary, isolated in the closet—like con-
ﬁnes of a second-ﬂoor ofﬁce in Trees Gymnasium. An ironic remark made
before Council last spring to the effect that the long climb from the lower
campus to Trees Gym would tax the strength of any healthy ath1ete,»not to
mention its effect on an afflicted patient, had its element of timely truth.
One scarcely needs to dwell on the other countless improvements in -the new
service. Suffice it to say that it meetsthe immediate needs of'th'e student
bod . ‘ .
' ‘ ySo far, the University has borne the expense of the new project, an as-
sumption of responsibility that was neither requestednor anticipated by the
petitioning Council. It was expected that the undergraduates here, as in other»
institutions, would be called upon to pay an annual health service fee in re-
turn for regular examination and treatment. The committee had even gone
so far as to work out estimated costs, showing fees that ranged from three
to ten dollars‘ per student. , . '
_ That unsolicited endowment from the University, more than anything
else, indicates that the administration has some respect for intelligent, con-
structive student 1egis1ation_—that there is yet a place for self-government in
our educational system.

The Buying Association Program

fraternity Cooperative Buying Association. Every INTELLIGENT fra-
most efficient and practical means yet offered for reducing the operating ex-
penses of the eighteen struggling campus fraternities.

Organized during the summer, the association, through its business man-
ager, Samuel Strauss, Col. ’32, and its supervisor, Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant "to the dean of men, functions as a purchasing agency for its members.
Suchcommodities as coal, ‘oi'l;'*iee,'“canned goods, milk, meats, vegetables and

panies endorsed-"by the association.

' Tremendous savings for the fraternity members is the result of this coop-
.e_rative buying plan. One can hardly doubt the eﬂicacy of a buying arrange-
ment which makes possible, in some instances, a saving of 24 per cent over
prices, previously ‘paid for the same and possibly an inferior product. Aver-
age savings of from ten to ﬁfteen per cent on most commodities will keep
a steady return of refund discounts ﬂowing into chapter treasuries.

"Because all bills must be paid through the association not later than 15‘
days after they are due to receive the discount savings, there will be "no

wait for their money. . -

And because the University has taken upon itself the obligation of meet-
ing the incidental operating expenses incurred for stationery, supplies and
telephone service, the discount savings of the association will "return to its
members. The only actual expense to be met by the association will be the
slight salary received by Strauss for the work he will be doing in the admin-

His‘ endorsement of a particular wholesale merchant means that the lat-
ter’s product has been selected on a basis of quality and price as the brand
to be used by the association members. Price alone is not always the de-
termining factor in the endorsement of a product.
Like-

fluctuations are recorded and checked against prices as billed to the office of
the association. The refund savings are returned to the fraternities when
theirbillsare paid, within the discount limit, to the association, which in
turn pays the wholesale merchant.

Fraternity men who are interested in fraternity welfare would do well
to. study the far-sighted and efficient planning of the Buying Association.

pressed a desire to elevate the con-
test to a plane in keeping with men
of the University. Dr.'McCormick
said, it almost grated on his nerves
when he read of the ﬁghts going_on
among the studelits of ;the High
schools and then was compelled to-

believe that the same thing might oc- '

cur in our, University. A isuggestiou
was made that the contest be made
more freefrom unsplortsmanlikeicoll-

classes. I Dean 'Fetterman spoke along

of winning, but to gain the conﬁdence

ule they face for the next nine consecutive weeks.
Beyond doubt Sutherland has another powerful football team despite the
loss of seven varsity linemen from the 1931_squad_. Hard work together with

necessary to properly meet the sched-

untiring effort on the part of players: ' '

- P Grid Coach

and coaches has developed‘ such
pleasing results that it would take
more than an optimist to believe the
sight of his own eyes.

Ted Dailey and Muggsy Sklanany,
who spelled Paul Collins and Captain
Eddie Hirshberg at the end positions
last year, have developed into a pair
of terminals that willaid materially
in the Panther passing attack,

Bobby Timmons, 180 pound Pitts-
burgh lad, can not be counted out of '
the race at this early date. Timmons,
a substitute last year, did not see a
great amount of service, but Suther-
land took time out from his work last
spring long enough to remark that
this lad was the mo.st promising can-
didate on his squad.

Louis Wojcihokski, and Harvey
Rocker, of last year’s freshman team,
also bidding for one of the end posi-
tions have been handicapped to some
extent because. of their lack of ex-
perience. '

j Cuba at Tackle

At the tackle positions thus far
Jock has favored Paul Cuba, New
Castle boy, who was kept out of the
greater part of last season's games
because of injuries, and Bob Hoel, a.
veritable‘ giant from Skip Goughler’s
freshman team.

Cuba was completely overlooked
last year in view of the gtellar per-
formances of John “-Cy" !Meredith and
Johnny Love, who alternated at the
tackle positions last season. How-
ever, _'when Sutherland called for a
tackle to ﬁll in for the ﬁrst signal
drill in camp, the shy -Cuba came out
of his usual obscurity and has be-
come .a permanent ﬁxture among the
first eleven’ ever since. .

Tar Onder, who understudied for

comer, Kenny Ormiston, seem almost
destined to occupy the two guard po-

Ormiston is the sort of ‘a. fellow
who possesses the exceptional ability
of stepping from the rank of a fresh-
man into one of the coveted positions
on Sutherland’s varsity football team.
Kenny makes up. that rare combina-
tion that football coaches dream
about. ‘He is fast, aggressive and an
exceptionally heady ball player.

Tormey Again at Center

-In -the center of the line Joe Tor-
mey has things pretty much his own
way. Tormey saw considerable serv-
ice last year as an understudy_to
Ralph Daugherty, All-American cen-

pivot position.
George Shotwell and Leslie Wilkins
have developed into- capable substi-
tutes, but their lack of experience
keeps them from endangering 'Tor-
mey’s position. ‘

One of the most gratifying things
that Coach Sutherland had to look

return of a wealth of likely
-backﬁeld material.

Captain Paul Rider and Warren
Heller of last year’s varsity will’
again occupy their respective half-
back positions and Bobby Hogan still
seems to have the edge on Rocco
Cutri, who pushed the Meadville boy
hard for the quarterback job last
Ye8-!'- , ’

However ‘Miller Munjas, quarter-
back on last year’s freshman team,
had gone relatively unnoticed until
the last few days in camp, when
Cutri because of minor injury was,
forced to miss practice, and the lad!
was chosen to pilot the second teanil

looking

evidently satisﬁed Sutherland, be-
cause for the -remander of the camp
Munjas alternated with Hogan and
Cutri in that position.
Johnny Luch Stricken

Johnny Luch,’ who was stricken
last week with a mild attack of ap-
pendicitis has not engaged in any
practice since he returned from the

team physician, found it unnecessary
to operate on"Lu‘ch after thoroughly
investigating his case, but precaution
will be taken not to antagonize Luch’s
ailment by having him return to prac-
tice too soon. ’

Izzy Weinstock and Heinie Weiseu-
baugh, both sophomore full.backs, the
latter being revamped from the half-

year’s Frosh team, are alternating in
the place left vacant by Luch. It is
hardly likely that Luch will play in
the opening contest against Ohio

Which Calibre of Men
May be Battered

 

\

Managers, managers, everywhere,
and not a bit of work done! The -bat-
tle cry of the managers- that has come
to be a ﬁxture of University life for
years and years is undergoing a
change that, it is hoped, will be per-
manent. . .

Beginning with the current football
season, an attempt istbeingpmade to
incorporate only the highest type. of
managerial, or possible managerial
talent into a body that will live up
to the highest traditions of the or-
der. ‘ ‘

In past years it has been the cus-
tom for the candidates to attend prac-
tice only when in the mood, which oc-
curred -so infrequently that another
system has been devised.

The present system, which will be
illustrated by the manner in which
the football is manager picked, seems

sued for all freshman candidates to
report to the varsity manager. At
the end of spring football practice, a

. appearing freshmen,

Thirty-five Candidates Work

Out: in Strenuous ‘ Drills

About thirty-ﬁve husky and capable
candidates for
the frosh grid team, went through
steady workouts last week on the
practice ﬁeld above the Stadium.
Coach “Skip” Gougler was in charge
of the proceedings and Eddie Schultz,
Ulhard Hangartner, and Jess Quatse
assisted him.

Among the. group of yearlings are
former stars from high schools and
prep schools of the entire Tri-State
district and several are expected to
develop into ‘---excellent material for
future varsity Pitt teams. All of
them, of course, need experience and
polishing, but the majority exhibit
decided possibilities.

There are ﬁve games on the Little
Panthers’ schedule this year and all
of them should be plenty tough. The
yearlings play, in order, Wyoming
Seminary, Carnegie Tech, Penn State,
West Virginia,‘ and, in the ﬁnal game
of the season, Kiski..

There are several freshmen who
possess a decidedly large amount of
the well-known beef and muscle on
the squad. Three tip the beam, at
over 200 pounds. Buskirk, tackle
from McMechen, is the heaviest man
on the squad, his weight equalling a
niséat 235 pounds. Bill Hall, from
Auburn, West Virginia, is a really
massive tackle whose meat. bone, and
gristle helps the marker -along to the
209_ pound point. Green, an excellent
prospect who hails from Huntingdon,

Pa., scales 205 pounds. Green is a .

half back.

Other men on the squad include
Wolff, West View; Johnny Wood,
New Martinsville, West Va.; Duff,
Schenley high school; Taylor, Lang-
ley high school; Roberts, California,
Pa.; Detzel, Erie;_ Schindel, Aurora,
Ill.; Mccue, Wilkinsburg; Triglone,
Wilkinsburg and Bellefonte; Shed-

loski, Nanti_col~:e;. Lynn, Sewickley;_-

Jim Hall, McMechen, West Va.; Sites,
Pittston, Pa.; McCune, Massanutten
Military _Academy and Newell, Pa.;
Swaney, Pittsburgh; LaRue, Greens-
burg and Wyoming Seminary;
Vaughn, Allegheny high school; Rec-
tor, Avella, Pa; Glassford, Lancast-
shire, Pa.; Random, MacDonald;
Failor, Harrisburg; McClure; Wohle-

mu th; Staughton; Taylor; Franks;
Malarkey; McMunn; Baxter and
Bache. '

The freshman schedule is as fol-
lows:

October .. 1—Wyoming Seminary at
Kingston, Pa.

October 15--Carnegie Tech at
Pittsburgh.

October 22-Penn‘ State at Sta_te
College. .

October 28--—West Virginia, at Fair-
mont (night). ’ —

complicated. First, a blanket call is is- ~

men will be kept as sophomore appren-
tices. Theseten, at the end of the
spring practice of their freshman
yiear, will receive their class numer-
a s.

When spring practice for their
sophomore year is completed, an ad-l
ditional cut will‘ be made in the
ranks, reducing the personnel to three
men. The remaining three will au-
tomatically become assistant man-
agers and will work with the team un-
til the end of their junior year, when
one will be appointed‘ varsity mana-
ger. The remaining two will be ,re-
warded with gold keys.

This year, at the Pitt‘ football train-
ing camp at Windber, a program of
athletics, of some sort or another, was
inaugurated with the opposing teams
being composed of the‘ coaches and
the managers. ‘

The best scheme to follow would
seem to be that of letting the coaches
win. (It’s good sense anyway.)
However, the various events -seem to
be on the up and up. -(Oh Yeah.)

Other sports in which the managers
participate to keep in condition are

and coaches’ tables, keeping the dining
hall in shape,‘taking care of the dress-
ing room, aiding in the medical cabin,
and making the coaches’ beds. All
good, clean sport!’

The two varsity co-managers, Jack
Mo-Parland. and Elmer Rosenbloom
are at camp in charge of affairs. Le-
roy Lewis, assistant to the varsity

case, VVeinstock will, from all ‘indica-
tions, get the ﬁrst call. -

Mel Brown, Mike Nichsich, and
Mike Sebastian look like the most
promising candidates for varsity un-
derstudies. ‘Sutherland is quite for-
tunate in having such capable men to
spell Captain Reider and Heller when
such a move is necessary.

‘Charles “Doc” -Hartwig, who was
kept out of varsity competition last
year because of injury, together with
Francis Seigel, have succeeded thus
far in making things uncomfortable
for the two varsity guards.

Much has been said of the back-
breaking schedule that Director of
Athletics W; D. Harrison has com-
piled for the Panthers this fall. It
might be said that the Panthers meet
everything from the “corn country”
of Nebraska to West Point of the
Hudson, and while Jock’s proteges
are matching football prowess with
that sort of company Pop Warner
will be on his way from Palo Alto
with one of the strongest teams

- I - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Sports Writer. _ s
The Pitt Panthers may go undefeated this season justas the Chicago

ready to wager the family heirlooms that they do.
The Ohio State debacle of 1930, the fact that the Bucks are expected to

wiched between Army and Notre Dame leads. me to expect trouble on October
’22." Pitt's first game against Ohio was their introduction to Big Ten circles
and they wanted to show the Columbus boys a few tricks. They did. The
next meeting at Columbus found Pitt indifferent and sluggish. The natural
rivalry_isn’t there. Sutherland faces a big problem pepping his proteges up
for this one. . ‘

The Irish have the well-known’ Indian sign on Pitt, as any of the
localconting-e'nt ‘who journeyed so hopefullytom South Bend last fall‘ will
readily agree. Why is inexplicable. It is one of ‘those thingslike the-
Penn“ Stateineptitude against Pitt back a few seasons when a highly-
praised Lion merelymtook one glance at the Panther and turned tail and
fled. The Irish loom just as strong as ever this year and form the big-
gest mental hazard of the year for the locals. _

Carnegie Tech, because the Plaid is‘ always twice as good as usual
in the city battle; is next hardest although Pitt.-is"the favorite on paper.‘
Stanford likely gets many votes but I can scarcely figure the Panther in
its windup game with Heller, Reider, Luch, Tormey and others in their
last appearance, doing any differentthan other Sutherland elevie-ns in their
fanewells. Sutherland has never lost the last game of his regular sched-
ule here at Pitt. By that time his minute attention to detailmhas oiled
up the perfect ‘machine. . .

Army is probably the toughest of the other games but I am stringing
along on Pitt because they made the soldier. boys look so bad_ last fall. I
give Nebraska the next notch with Penn closebehind.‘

West Virginia: and Duquesne should provide interesting but not crucial
games. If you want to be.on a sure thing, though, TAKE THE PANTHERS
AGAINST OHIO NORTHERN. That is_ one where you just can’t go wrong.

 

. , By JESS CARVER
— Football Writer, Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph. -

It would be a pretty game one who would have the old cork to come right
out and predict an unbeaten season for Pitt. Such a chappie would have to
be about two inches and a half on the good side.of complete insanity.

The games Pitt must take sp-ecialcare in preparing for are the
ones with Notre Dame, Carnegie Tech, Ohio State and with Stanford.

If the Irish and Cardinals. can be beaten, then the cha_nces.of_ scoring.

a clean sweep will be very, very good, but deep inside this manly

breast lurks a hunch that the ball game that"Is likely to cause the

Panthers the greatest trouble and that may spoil a fine record will be

' the one with‘Ohio State. That is just a hunch .‘ . . but don’t forget,
the Buckeyes are supposed to have the most powerful team in the

Western Conference this Year.

Do not get the idea from all this that your correspondent isn’t taken with the
general appearance of the Pitt squad. It is about as classy a locking layout
of football strength as I’ve ever seen at Pitt, or any other school, for that
matter. There is speed and weight and individual brilliance as typiﬁed by

Enter by Gates 7- and 8

Students will no longer trek up
those-many steps at the side of the
Pitt stadium to get to theircheering
sections, for a. change has been-. made
by the athletic department in the
seating arrangements for ‘under-
graduates. For the past, three years
students have been assigned to sec-
tions .33, 34, and 35 on thelnorth side
of the playing ﬁeld, with entrance at
gate 22.

- This year, effective with the Ohio
Northern-Pitt football this Week, ‘stu-
dents Will beseated in sections 15,
16, and 17,,with entrance to these
sections through gates seven and
l eight.

Complain on North.Side

Originally these sections onthe
south side of the ﬁeld were designat-
‘ed as the undergraduaute sections.-
The change from the north side of the
ﬁeld was made on camplaints re-
ceived last year after several games.
During the halves of these games,
special cheer and placard displays
were put on by thestudents. These
displays, it was said, could not be
seen by the University alumni sec-
tions on the opposite side of the ﬁeld.
Too,.the change was made onthe ad-
vicéof head football coach, Suther-
land, who believes it will help his
players in havingptheir benches on
the south side of the playing ﬁeld
near the "entrance gate.

. No difference will be made by the
move in the ﬁeld positions of the
sections. The three'sections will ex-
tend from the-20 to the 40-yard line
