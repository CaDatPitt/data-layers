‘ Donna Zaccaro, daughter of vice
presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, yesterday took on a room-

. ful of student questioners ‘— includ-
i_ng some who were hostile —— on a
campaign swing to stir students to
vote for the Democratic ticket.
Zaccaro, 22, and a recent graduate
of Brown University, has ‘cam-
paigned at- college campuses
throughout the country to address
the issue from a younger person’s
viewpoint.

She began her visit by urging stu-
§ dents to get involved in this year’s

election. “College is a wonderful .

have to deal with things outside of ‘I
classes, so they have to get out and

get involved.”

When asked whether she thought
there ‘was a wave of apathy in college
students, Zaccaro replied, “In col-
lege, people are responsible for
themselves, that’s it. It is a very shel-
tered environment, but you have to
make an effort to reach out beyond
that sheltered environment and get
involved. There was a poll taken
among Ivy League students that
showed"Mondale as being ahead.
That‘s good — that shows that the
universities are getting interested."

She went on to point out that
young people should be concerned
with current issues. “It took Reagan

three and one-half years to meet
with the Soviet diplomats. People
should be as concerned with what is
being done with toxic waste dumps
and such things as the cuts in state
loans and financial aid."

A number of the questions, from
the mixed audience of Mondale and
Reagan supporters, concerned Fer-
raro‘s stand ‘on the issues. Zaccaro
handled the questions, including
those surrounding her mother’s
stand on abortion, with case. On the
abortion issue, in which Ferraro was
accused of being an “activist," Zac-
caro explained that her mother is
opposed to abortion and that the
entire family is devoutly Catholic,
but she [Ferraro] did not want.,to
impose personal views on the public.
Her supporters applauded her state-

Weinberger, backs

peace through might

. By Bryan Lee

The Pitt News

Outside the Hilton Hotel yester-
day, protesters from the Thomas
Merton Center displayed signs read-
ing, “Caspar the Ghostmaker, go
away." Inside, Secretary of Defense
Caspar W. Weinberger was talking
about “...survival, the survival of
people everywhere."

Weinberger said there are three
ways to keep the peace. The first is to
be strong “militarily, economically,
and morally." “Strength "is the best
way to deter aggression," said Wein-
berger. He emphasized our allies as a
primary source of that strength.

 Secondly, according to Wein-
berger, “We must constantly strive

~ -for-agreernents with ,the..U.S.S.R. to .

veriﬁably reduce nuclear weapons."
He claimed the Reagan administra-
tion's goal is to eliminate nuclear
weapons entirely.

- “We must persuade the Russians

to come back to the [negotiating]
table,” said Weinberger.

Lastly, Weinberger said to pre-
serve peace, the U.S. must develop ‘a
thoroughly reliable way to destroy
nuclear weapons in ﬂight. Wein-
berger characterized this effort as
“noble” and “a system of protection,

' not retaliation.”

He said the administration’s pres-
ent aim is not so much to secure a
defensive capability to win a war,
“but to make obsolete these terrible
weapons of destruction."

“This is our objective,"said Wein-
berger. “Democracy must be sup-
ported by force of" ideas, not just
arms.”-

Weinberger said that the Reagan
Administration for the past four
years has been restoring the nation’s
defenses, which he said had been
neglected throughout the 1970s.

“We are at a higher state of readi-
ness," said Weinberger, “but we
have a long way to go.”

Weinberger said that this renewed
strength by itself is not “signiﬁcant”

perimeter." _

“Democracy must be
supported b y force of
ideas, not just arms.”

—Caspar Weinberger

if we don't work together with our .
allies. He said that the U.S. and our _

alliesmust show “unswerving solid-

arity in the face of Soviet pressure." _

Weinberger said that by helping our
allies, we are helping ourselves. “It is
better to defend Pennsylvania in
Europe," said Weinberger, “and we
must be strong enough to counter a
challenge wherever it may arise.” He
said that the Soviets are the primary

challenge and an “awesome, gro- _

wing...military power.” Weinberger
said that the U.S. “invites aggres-
sion“ , by limiting its “strategic

But of all the threats to peace,

according to Weinberger, none is
more prominent than to prevent
nuclear war. Weinberger said that
the best way to prevent this is
through strength. He said that dur-
ing the 70s the U.S. limited its
nuclear weapons while the Soviet
Union stepped-up its nuclear capa-
bility. “We must take the kind of
action that induces them to nego-
tiate," said Weinberger.

He said that from the outset, the
Reagan administration has made it
plain that “they don't wantan agree-
ment just for the sake of an agree-
ment.” The administration calls
negotiations “arms reduction” talks
rather than “arms limitation" talks,
Weinberger said, because the arms
limitation talks of the 1970s only led
to increases in nuclear weapons
stockpiles. “We want to sit down
today," said Weinberger, “and make
genuine arms reductions possible.

“If we persevere,”continued
Weinberger, “we can convince the
Soviets to re-examine their stra-

tegy.” Weinberger added that peace ~
is best secured by “a defense of non-'

nuclear means. We look to the day
when we may destroy weapons in the
air," said Weinberger, “before they
hit the ground._" Once we have that
capability, said Weinberger, it will
“bring us closer to a new era of
peace." '

Hospitals
get new

president

By Bill Nlchle
The Pitt News

The University Health Center of
Pittsburgh (UHCP) has a new. presi-
dent, Joel H. Ettinger. ,

Before joining UHCP, Ettinger.
held various professional positions .

in the health ﬁeld including adminis-
trative posts at both the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn. and Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute in
New York. .

UHCP is a confederacy of general
and specialty teaching hospitals,

, clinics, and services and agencies.

Some of the members of UHCP
include: Children’s Hospital of

Pittsburgh, Eye and Ear Hospital,-

Magee-Womens Hospital, Monteﬁ-
ore Hospital, Presbyterian Univer-
sity Hospital, ahd Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

As president, J oel Ettinger’s job is
to coordinate the collective interests
of its member hospitals. “One of our
objectives is to work in the best
interest of the Pittsburgh health
community but also to preserve aca-
demics and teaching in the hospi-

tals,” said Ettinger. “Today hospital ’

thing of the past but we (UHCP) are

Ettinger. '
“Identifying our member hospi-

tals’ common interests and creating‘

programs to satisfy these interests is
very important,” said Ettinger. “It
helps keep Pittsburgh a leader in
health care.”

An example of one of these pro- I

grams is the new Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Institute (NMR) now
under construction at the corner of
Craft and Fifth Avenues in Oak-
land. This new facility will make

nique is safer than X-rays or other
methods.

The NMR institute works along
with another program initiated by
the UHCP, Pittsburgh Cancer Insti-
tute. “Like the NMR institute the
Cancer Institute will allow people to
have greater access to the UHCP,
provide the best in research, quality
treatment, and at the same time keep
health care as affordable as possi-
ble,” said Ettinger.

Series on Survival: - .

Nuclear warfare declared as  

an act of lunacy by speaker

By Greg Evanlna
The Pitt News

“Thermonuclear warfare may
have become a physical impossibil-
ity. And-, in all likelihood, the wea-
pons can not ever be used for any
decisive kind of military accomp-
lishment — unless we are all caught
up — on both sides, in a fit of collec-
tive lunacy,” according to award-
winning author Dr. Lewis Thomas.

Thomas, who is Chancellor of the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Institute in New York City, spoke
Monday night before a crowd of
about 500 people at the Allegheny
County Soldiers’ Memorial. He is
dedicated to the fight against
nuclear warfare. The basis of his
argument against thermonuclear
warfare centers around a concept
known as nuclear winter.

Nuclear winter refers to the condi-
tion created when a huge cloud of
dust and soot rises from the earth
after nuclear war, Thomas
explained. This cloud could cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere and
part of the Southern Hemisphere,
blocking out sunlight and effectively

killing most plant and animal life, he

.added.

Therefore, even if one country
successfully attacks another without
being retaliated on, the victor will
only have about a week to celebrate,
Thomas said. Eventually, nuclear
winter will kill them.

Although the theory of nuclear
winter came about recently (late

Spring, 1983), Thomas felt that at

least 25 percent of the U.S. popula-
tion is not aware of it. He said that a
lack of media coverage of the issue is
mostly to blame, especially since the
nuclear winter theory was discussed

at three conferences open to the pub-

lie and the media.

However, Thomas did not place
the blame for our society’s view of
nuclear weapons solely on the
media, but on the subconscious of
human beings themselves. “There is,
to face it squarely, something terri-
bly attractive about nuclear missiles
and their bombs,” he said.

“They are there, buried like pol-
ished jewels in wonderfully engi-
neered silos. And, with the touch of
a human finger, they will ascend
smoothly into space beyond the
stratosphere, curve over the Earth,

descend to a target halfway around

the planet and they destroy, by blast'

and firestorm, any city they like," he
said. “In short, they are the most
marvelous tovs ever devised bv man:
triumphs of the human intellect."

But, even if there is a nuclear war‘

in which the United States is victor-
ious, Thomas questioned what they
would do afterward. “We decide the
big questions like how to change
their form of government to what-
ever form we like better. What do we
do about the immediate problem of

' perhaps hundreds of millions of"

human beings in both huge nations
dying before our eyes from body

burns, blast injuries, radiation dis- -

ease and later on, frozen and starv-
ing. What kind of society would ours
turn into?"

Questions like these prompted
Thomas to say that there should be a
freeze on nuclear science. However,
he does not consider nuclear science
to bea real science. He reasons that
it has nothing to do with the compre-
hension of or an inquiry into nature,
but that it delves into the destruction
of nature. “It should be brought to a
stop bv both sides before it gets

totally out of hand,” Thomas said.

Budgetary
Bed fellows

On Oct. 23, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences held a -

meeting that could not have been more absurd had the
Monty Python troupe written its script. The meeting was
called to discuss Provost Roger Benjamin’s budgetary
planning exercise, an exercise that thus far seems consist-
ent with the Board of Trustees’ desire to “run this place
like a business.” ,
The FAS planners announced that only nine out of a
present 30 departments are “absolutely essential” to the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leaving 21 departments to
be co-opted by other departments, reduced substantially
or done away with altogether. Then, in a deft and unusual
display of insight, FAS planners declared that a 25-
percent cut in the overall budget could not be perpetrated
without in some way adversely affecting the quality of
education at the University of Pittsburgh. The planners
concluded that a 25-percent cut would mean larger class

..sizes, fewer courses from which to choose, the complete
‘elimination of the Writing Workshop, the Advising Cen-
ter, professional programs and a few doctoral programs,

just for good measure. ,
Perhaps if the economy were presently unfriendly to
big businesses like the University of Pittsburgh or the
university had not experienced a steady increase in
undergraduate enrollment (despite the fact that western
Pennsylvania has seen the opposite occur in nearly every
other institution of higher education), such thinking

might transcend mere logic and unite with reason, but’

this is not the case. Indeed, the tone of Virgil Cantini
seemed to suggest that the university is operating at a
comfortable surplus. What,.then, can be the reason for
this blind groping for austerity? _ ‘
It would appear that greed offers a fair explanation, for
many pure “pork barrel” expenses were left completely
unscathed by the thought of budget reduction. What has
remained secure? Administrative lunch accounts, Wesley
Posvar‘s receptions (held in a -not altogether modest,
university-financed house), the administrative body as a
whole, research—for-research’s-sake projects, Semester at

Sea and administrative travel expense accounts, to name _

a few.

Has this absurdity occured because the administration
is morally bankrupt? Probably not. Has it occurred
because there is nothing that anyone can do about it? No!
It has occured because no one is willing to do anything in
the way of work or real thought, leading to a self-
propagating string of learned incompetence.

Truth of  

Invasion

As one of the medical students in
Grenada at this time last year, I am
deeply concerned about the so-
called “Student Liberation Days”
being organized on college cam-
puses by right-wing groups, pur-
portedly to celebrate the United
States’ invasion of Grenada.

Whether my life and those of my
fellow medical students were endan-
gered by the coup that overthrew
Maurice Bishop is very much open
to question. It is clear, however, that
our “liberation” by the Reagan
administration came at a terrible
cost: dozens of young America,
Cuban and Grenadian lives.

That is a fact that the people
organizing Student Liberation Day
may not want you to know. Nor may
they want you to know thecourse
they would like to see our nation
follow in other parts of Latin Amer-
ica, namely such places as Nicara-
gua, El Salvador and Honduras.

If American troops are ‘sent to
those countries as some would like,
they ‘won't be facing a few hundred
glorified policemen and Cuban con-
struction workers as they did in
Grenada. They won't be fighting on

V a sunny tropical island, as they did in _

Grenada. ‘

If American troops are sent to
Central America, it’s more likely
they will ﬁght thousands of well-
trained soldiers and guerillas willing
to give everything to defend their
homelands and their ideals.‘

As in Vietnam , American soldiers
will face the uncertainty of whether
the’ peasants in the villages before
them are friend or foe. They will
battle again in scorching heat, dense )-
and hilly terrain and unfamiliar
territory. r ,

"Polls show that most students, as
well as the majority of Americans,
want peace in Central America
through political and diplomatic
means, not more bloodshed through
clumsy and misguided American
intervention. If the organizers
behind Student Liberation Day
mean to suggest through their mind-
less celebration of the invasion of
Grenada that students support mil-
itary ventures on behalf of unpopu-
lar and repressive ‘ dictators in
Central America, I suggest they ask
students first. '

Instead of celebrating the libera-
tion of students, their actions only
encourage _the decimation of stu-
dents. The publicity from their ral-,
lies, if not countered immediately, J

They should recognize, asEl Sal-C

vador ’ president Jose Napoleon
Duarte has, that hundreds of years
in poverty, exploitation and despair

- are at the roots of the conflict in

Central America, not the struggle
between foreign ideologies. They
should recognize,‘ as most students
do, thatit only hurts the prospects
for peace when our government sup.-
ports those who have the most to

- gain by continued bloodshed: The

contras in Nicaragua and the

government-tolerated death squads t

in El Salvador and elsewhere.
There still _is time to act before our
government sends us on ahopeless
in Central America.
Regardless of the foolishness of
these right-wing Student Liberation
Days, let us ensure that our country
not repeat the mistakes of the past
by getting involved in an endless war
on the wrong side of the battle.

Hopeless
Generation.

In the‘ Oct. 26 issue of The Pitt
News the editorial and two letters to
the editor spoke out against the Rea-
gana administration. All made valid

. attacks on the 'administration’s pbli-

cies, and for the most part were
organized and well worded
(although I think “political valium”
is a tad excessive). Sadly, none of the
articles will have any effect on_ the.
way the population of this school
and "the nation as a whole votes.
Both will most likely pick Reagan to
be the President for another term.
Why? What is wrong? '

Let us examine the two age groups .

in which Reagan has the greatest
support. The two groups are those
age 30-44 and those l8-24. Although
there has been quite a bit of stir over
that second group, our generation, I
argue both groups have reason to
support Reagan over Mondale. The
first group is a little easier to discuss.
Look at the “common man“ from
that age group. He has seen unem-
ployment come down under Rea-
gan. Oh yes, you argue, it also went
up under Reagan. True enough, but
that was’then. It has since then come
down, and perhaps our "common
man has a job because it came down.

He has seen a drastic reduction in"

the interest rates, and perhaps he
was able to buy a new house or car
wn. _He has

 
  

 

ing out of control. The common.

man is better off now than he was
two years ago.

The common man doesn’t care
about the national debt. Maybe he
should but he doesn’t..He handles
his own debts which have become
more manageable. Perhaps this atti-
tude shows a lack of concern about

' the future, but keep in mind that this

person's present has been difficult
‘enough to deal with, without being
concerned about the future. Now his
present has stabilized somewhat, he
wants to relax. The: future'can be

- ignored a little longer while the pres-

ent is allowed to become ajbit more:
stable. _ _

How can such logic be argued
against? For our common man,
Reagan is the clear choice. But what
about the 18-24 age group? Why do
they support President Reagan? The
experts say a wave of conservatism
has washed over the youth of Amer-
ica but have you ever listened to this
conservative youth argue his politi-
cal views? I suggest they take a long
hard look at the definition of “con-
servative,” and carefully study what
they are arguing for, because what-
ever.it is they are attempting to say,

‘ it isn’t “of or relating to a philosophy

that advocates preservation of the
established order.” It is a terribly
confusing mixture of pseudo-
patriotism intermingled with a pol-

~ icy of the destruction of the existing
order rather than a preservation of _
‘it. But why do they support a presi-

dent who has absolutely nothing for
their generation? The youth of this
country will have to inherit the
havoc created by another Reagan
administration. “This election

affects your future,_" the youth of

America is repeatedly told. But the
warning falls on uncomprehending
ears.
“future” has no meaning to them.
Oh it’s not like our common man
who simply doesn't care: the youth
of America has no idea what the
word_ future means. For too many
years, the same. voices that are-now
telling young people that this elec-
tion will have an effect on the future
have been telling them that they
have no future: They have lived far
too long with the assumption that in
their lifetime,they were going to be
killed in a nuclear war. The threat
has created" nothing less-than a suici-
dal generation. A generation with-
out hope. _ _

On November 6 the youth of this
nation may be instrumental in put-
ting Reagan in office and thereby
signing a pact with death. If Reagan
doesn’t come through, they will try
again in 1988 and then, ifpwe reach
1988, they will be joined by another

urice Mallin

- It’s Time to"Move On

9.

This columinist has supported, on
this page, in private discussion, and
with personal conviction, a substan-
tial amount of what has become
known as the “Reagan Revolution.”
The two broad goals for which Rea-
gan campaigned in 1980, rejuvenat-
ing the economy and restoring the
credibility of our national defense,
were goals I shared‘ and believed
were necessary for the country.

Yet in this election I am voting for
Walter Mondale.

Throughout this campaign,‘ Rea-
gan has purposely failed to address

the substantive issues which face our ~

nation. He criticizes Mondale’s
deficit-reducing plan, for example,
but offers no alternative. The deficit
is a serious problem. Its sheer size
threatens to undermine the recov-
ery. Yet Reagan offers no real plan
to confront and manage this
problem. ’

Reagan's campaign strategy
seems’to be based on the purposeful
avoidance of substantive , issues.
Instead he proclaims America’s
return (from -where?) and strives to
strike patriotic chords within us.
The implication is that America is
back because of Ronald Reagan. I

Reagan recognizes that most
American's don’t really want to dis-

cuss the issues. The underlying

assumption, probably true, is that
with inﬂation down and peopleifeel-
ing financially secure, other issues
lose their relevance. People vote
with their pocketbooks.

The polls show that Reagan's
approach is working. But success
does not excuse Reagan's abdication
of his responsibility as a candidate
for the presidency. .

Reagan has restored the credibil-
ity of our strategic deterrent forces.
But he has allowed the capability of
our conventional forces_ to erode
seriously. With inadequate conven-
tional options, the U.S. in time of
war, may thus be forced to prema-
turely employ nuclear forces.

. Reagan has argued consistently
that-negotiating arms control with
the. Soviets would have to be pre-
ceded by the strategic moderniza-
tion program. Consequently, it is
only now that Reagan is making
overtures toward the Soviet Union.
This is commendable; yetit is highly
suspicious that Reagan‘s new tone
appeared only weeks before the
upcoming election. Would the new
Reagan carry over into" a second
term? With his economic and mil-

.i'tary agenda securely in place, a

Reagan second term would see'an
emphasis on social issues, such as
abortion, school prayer, and the

like. These may be viable topics of
political debate, but they do not
deserve to be at the center of the
political process. They certainly do
not belong in the Constitution,
where Reagan would put them.

This raises the spectre of a “Rea-.
gan Supreme Court." Reagan’s plat-
form calls for the nomination of
justices sympathetic to his views on
abortion and thus, by implication,’
other social issues. A Reagan
Supreme Court would be too‘ ideo-
logically conservative to interpret
impartially the laws of the. land.

In his first term Reagan set a new
agenda and radically changed the
priorities of American politics. Our
country needed the Reagan Revolu-
tion, and we are the better for it. But
now it is time to move on.

Mondale is realistically address-
ing our nation's problems. He has ,
provided a concrete plan to reduce
the deficit. He will reorient defense
spending toward improving our
conventional capability. He will not -
dismantle the Reagan agenda but
will contain its extremism. It is time
for Americans to give Mondale a

, sound listening to — and soon. He is

not just the alternative to Reagan
but a strong, viable candidate in his
own right. . ‘

Author offers Vietnamese view

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

"The stench that clung to every-
thing and thousands of voices rever-
berating like cicadas on a summer
night made me feel queas y. I ate only
out of politeness, and even then I felt
guilty. I knew the islanders had had
no fresh fruit, vegetables, meat or
eggs in over a month and that they
restlessly awaited distribution of the
newly arrived cabbages. As —I
nibbled, children stood behind the

low corrugated wall that separated

the Coconut Inn from crowds pres-
sing along the path. They stared with
almond eyes, watching me eat."

— “Sensing the Enemy”

by Lady Borton _

_Many writers in the past decade
have dedicated volumes of work to
describing the horrors of the Viet-
nam War, but few have done it quite
the way Lady Borton has. Miss Bor-
ton is a Quaker relief worker who
spent her strength and patience both
in Vietnam during the war and, most
recently, in Malaysian camps for
Vietnamese refugees, working as a
health administrator. She wanted to
write a different account of the ever-

popular Vietnam theme, puttingthe

usually completely ignored Viet-
namese in the foreground, and the
westerners in the back.-

Borton is coming to Pitt Wednes-
day, Oct. 31 to speak about her
experiences in Vietnam and Malay-
sia and discuss her motivation for
writing her recently published book,
“Sensing the Enemy." Her talk be-
gins at 8 p.m. in room 501, Cathed-
ral of Learning.

“Sensing the Enemy“ is an alter-
native to most literature on Viet-
nam. Lady Borton felt the need to
focus on the lifestyles of the still suf-
fering Vietnamese, who were left to
fend for themselves after, in Bor-
ton’s words, “we wreaked havoc and
then left.” » '

The book describes her own expe-
riences in the refugee camp of Pulau
Bidong, a small island off the coast

. of West Malaysia. When Borton

arrived on the island in 1982 she says
she found a camp that “housed
13,000 Vietnamese boat people in
the same amount of space as the val-
ley farm on which for years I’d lived
alone. _

' “I wanted to turn the focuson the
island,” she said, but her editor
wanted the book to stress her expe-
riences and frustrations as she

_ adapted to the filthy conditions of.

her environment. Her overwhelming
task of trying to administer health
services to multitudes‘ of Viet-
namese, anxiously awaiting passage
to the‘ United States and “out of
hell,” is the basis of “Sensing the

Enemy.” if

Borton saw a Pulau Bidong of
improving conditions, she said. At
its peak, the camp held 43,000 refu-
gees and had insufficient staff and
supplies. However; the island was
equipped with a hospital upon her
arrival in 1982, although it wasn’t
free of rats and “that camp smell — a
mixture of stagnant water and stale
urine.”

Much of the frustration Borton‘

felt in Pulau Bidon, she said, was
from the burden of sticking out in a"
community of Vietnamese, being a

_ “Ba My,”an American woman. Bor-

ton had the rare ability among for-

’ eign staff of being able to actually

speak Vietnamese, which put an
additional burden on her. Refugees
clung to her, making impossible
requests and sometimes even expect-
ing she “could get them immediate
passage to the US.” However, Bor-
ton felt that this also gave her an
advantage in her work and she “put

_ a real priority” on learning to speak.

“You can hear what’s going on
around you,” she said. '

Though some critics have stressed
that the point of her book and its
very title, “Sensing the Enemy,” is to
criticize the apathy of U.S. citizens
and government in helping these
refugee victims of our own war, Bor-
ton denies this. “The ‘enemy’ is
inside,” she said, “and so is the
capacity to destroy ourselves, or the
capacity to heal.”

Lady Borton te her k on the problems in

Vietnam.

wered the question on taxes by
outlining Mondale’s two-part plan
to control the deficit, and comparing
it with Reagan’s request for a sales
tax and ﬂat tax. She said that mak-
ing everyone pay the same amount

her mother is one of the most promi-
nent news figures in the country. She
and her younger brother and sister
are traveling throughout the country
along with the Mondale family. Zac-
caro does not seem to mind, as she
has been actively involved in politics
with her mother since she was 15.
“People don’t realize how much
government means,” said Zaccaro,
“This is not a good time. Politics are-
not fun, but it is very rewarding. It’s
a lot of work — a seven day a week
job. But it has to be done.

Labor Camps

(Editor's Note: The «information
in this article was gathered through

- the use of interpreters. The writers

do not claim the statements made
are indisputable facts. Thoughtful
evaluation and counter-argument
are strongly encouraged due to the
apparent timeliness and signiﬁcance
of the following material.)
/

Michail Makarenko felt that
he was 100 percent Soviet, that
he shared all of the official ideas
of the Russian Communist
Party, accepted its goals and was
willing to spend his life trying to
achieve them. He was raised

under an “official eye” to pursue '

two goals: one was to defend the
homeland from Western aggres-
sion, the other was to liberate
from oppression slave laborers
of the capitalist system. Maka-
renko is a dedicated communist
who believes the Russian Revo-
lution was betrayed by a fascist
element.

According to Makarenko, a
Russian defector who visited the
Pitt and CMU campuses on Fri-
day, there are presently, about
2,000 labor camps operating
inside the Soviet Union. Con-

~trary to.popular Western opin-

ion, the majority of camps are

T concentrated not in Siberia but

in the European part of Russia.
Because the number of camps is
an official state _ secret, the
number of laborers actually held
inside them is hard to confirm. It

_ is estimated that there are 17 to

19’ million prisoners presently
confined to labor camps. T

Makarenko said that the
Soviet Union had been using
labor camps 12 years before
Adolf Hitler came to power in
after which they

tion camp." He went on to
explain that the Soviet camps
are basically for people who
commit small or large crimes as
defined by the state or who
manifested their disagreement
with the government.

Makarenko, for example,
grew up in an orphanage in

‘ .Romania and at the age of 14

entered a- military academy.
. Entering the real world, as he put

A it,.'revealed to him the inherent

inconsistency and contradiction
of the Soviet brand of commu-
nism. As a man of conscience,
Makarenko quit military school
and was hence directed to service

at a labor camp. Ironically,
Michail formed a Labor Party
with the goal to implement the
ideals of Marxist working-class
communism, a doctrine to
which the Soviets paid lip service
but opposed in practice. His
efforts produced little success.
After» serving for eight years, he
returned to his family and was

consequently apprehended by-

the KGB officials who, Maka-
renko said, literally lifted him off
the ground and carried him
away. The officials told him that
from now on he would be
accompanied by a civilian who
would stand two or three feet
away from him at all times.
Makarenko was told that he
would get used to the surveil-
lance. Somehow, Michail man-
aged to escape twice. The details
of his experience are not known
at this writing.

After his second escape from a
hard labor camp, one for politi-

cal prisoners, he lived under-'

ground in Moscow for
one-and-a-half years. Maka-
renko explained that during this
time he triedto use the official
"bureaucracy to deal back some
of the anger and frustration the
party had dealt him in the past.
He said that during this period
he was in constant communica-
tion with the KGB. After one-
and-a-half years of not being
able to trace Michail’s letters or
pinpoint his location, the KGB
declared him to be a wanted state

‘criminal. Wanted lists are rare in

the Soviet Union, Makarenko

-explained, because they are an

admittance of crime and dissent.

The KGB then approached
Makarenko’s son-in-law and
advised him to transfer a mes-
sage to Michail: either he sur-
render in the next five days and
be expelled from'the countryfor
die and further endanger his

‘ family. Naturally, he chose to

leave. He arrivedvin the West via
East Germany.

Makarenko brought with him
a short film that he’ said he made
by reading books. The film is of a
secret vigil held to honor the esti-
mated 67 million victims of the
Red Terror of 1918. Makarenko
explained that 10 months after
the Soviets claimed power, Len-
in's government issued a decree

of mass terror and the use of -

labor camps “to safeguard the

homefront.” This action was to
weed out the ,“old elements” left
over from the revolution. so that
the Soviets could proceed in
creating “a new-man.” Accord-
ing to ‘Makarenko, people were

simply" _picked off the street, '
prosecuted without trials and

sentenced to labor. The prison-
ers were mostly young, ages 14 to

24. Sixty percent of the dead‘

were under age 24.

For 45 years, mass graves of
bones of prisoners who built the
White Sea,-Baltic Sea Canal in
the l930’s with their bare hands
lay uncovered. Makarenko said
that the Soviets usually destroy
graves of their victims to leave
no trace of crime. On Sept. 5, the
same day as Lenin‘s 1918 decree,

‘ a portion of the ashes was taken 

to Moscow for a memorial ser-
vice. Makarenko’s ﬁlm showed a
small group of people lighting
candles and bowing their heads

amid a box of skulls. The walls ‘
of the room were covered with

white sheets so that werethe film
seized, the vigil’s location would
remain a secret. The people par-
taking in the service, however,
were clearly risking their lives. It

was Makarenko’s original idea?

I ,4: .«..' {
''.$~’‘a',‘‘i)s}«. '-.' 3

to establish a memorial to show
evidence of the labor camps in
Russia. He presented his film to
a Senate Intelligence Committee
upon entry to the United States.

 Makarenko said that a law
had been recently passed in the .

Soviet Union prohibiting the
imprisonment of children the
age of 12 or younger. Women
who give birth in the camp may
keep the child for two years,
after which the child enters an
orphanage. Makarenko also
said that, officially, a person
may not be sentenced to more
than 25 years in a labor camp but
that the officials add years on the
sentences, nevertheless. "

One can be sentenced to labor
for five years for purposely des-
troying agricultural produce or a
defective factory product. The
essence of the crime lies in the
use of individual initiative,
something the Soviet system
does not condone. Makarenko
said that all official holidays
must be observed; to celebrate
any other is a crime punishable
by at least five days of labor.
Once inside the camp, one must

maintain a certain production .

level to receive any "medical.

attention.’ Makarenko. made a

striking comparison between the 3

camps of Auschwitz and thosgﬁxin

Russia —prisoners in the Au‘s‘ch- -
witz‘ camp were given a daily-

caloric allowance. of 2,076 calo-
ries compared to the 2,050 maxi-
mum level given the Russian

‘ prisoners.

Makarenko explained that the

people chosen to suffer are those
‘ who don’t totally accept the

Soviet regime and its goals.’ He
said from childhood one learns
the truth, that “we are slaves —

they [Soviets] are different fr€‘3n~
us and we are different from-

them.” Everyone lives two lives,

” a private one and ‘an official one, "
which are drastically different.‘

. Makarenko said that no one in —.-'
‘ the party has illusions about the =

truth; they know that people

simply perform their dutyto get
rewards. Makarenko believed
that 50 percent of the Ru ' n

* people simply “play the garﬁ/e‘L'”’

ideas‘ to increase production and -

 

schools keep ﬁles containingthe
academic activities, views and
psychological development of
each student. As a young man, -
Makarenko said he realized that
his psychology was much differ-

ent from the others’. He

explained that children ‘in the
orphanage were taught one sim-
ple truth to help them survive:

“Those who kill and enslave us /

are worse‘ than, fascists. Those

who cooperate with the govern-

ment are traitors of - the people
and must be treated as enemies.”

Makarenko _said that in the
Soviet Union,.there are different
kinds‘ of resistance: cultural, pol-
itical, ideological, and eco-
nomic. Some forms of resistance
are funny, he said, “like wearing
long hair or a heard as people in
the West/do.” Ifta man has or
expresses some small detail of

_ Western society, such as a wom-

an's lipstick, he claimed, itis per-
ceived as a statement against the
Soviet ’ system. According to

V Makarenko, everyone goes to

work but,.tries to ﬁgure out ways
to do the least he can.

, Makarenko said feels that
‘in order to succeed, the source of

a

resistance really has to come
from outside the Soviet Union.

He said that the United States
can help strengthen the resist-
ance by maintaining a neutral
position in trade policies and by
not negotiating with the Soviets.

- In .a sense, explained» Maka-

renko, the United States often
helps the Soviet regime by supp-
lying '_ them with a source of

. strength. Economic isolation, he

said, will take its toll on the
Soviets. ‘ '

The bottom line is, this,
according to Makarenko: Peo-

_ ple simply are “not satisﬁed‘ to

work for the state. Makarenko
said that with only .6'percent of
the acreage, home gardens pro-

‘duce three times as much as col-
« lective farms. The real function

of the labor camps is to, get jobs
done that no one will volunteer

for, like building the Siberian »

pipeline in sub-zero weather
without machinery. The camps
are an economic necessity. Since
there is no viable incentive to get
‘people to work, the Soviets rely

. on forced labor and the black-

market to keep their economy

going. ’

Q

“A bullet will buy enough to get high.”

' — Aleksandr Voromov

\
A British journalist recently risked his life by sneaking

into Kabul, Afghanistan. He returned with a report of a '

city under seige, surrounded by Muslim‘ guerrillas bom-
barding the city daily with mortar ﬁre. Russiansoldiers,
he reported, buy opiated marijuana from Afghan youths
on bicycles. V ’
This story was confirmed“ Friday by Aleksandr

Voromov, a shy, 20-year old deserter from the Russian”

army in Afghanistan. ‘

“A bullet will buy enough to get high, and you do it if

[even though you know they will be ﬁring it back at you
the next day.”

Through an interpreter, Voromov told a tale of con-
stant hunger. He said the soldiers in Afganistan have
plenty of weapons but precious little food, unless of
course one is an ofﬁcer. Morale is low, soldiers take
drugs, and desertion is rampant.

Voromov» said he decided to desert on the spur of the
moment. As a truck driver for a mobile propaganda unit,
hunger drove him to trade gasoline to the Afghans for
food. He was caught by the Russians and immediately
incarcerated in a make-shift barn prison. Voromov said
the barn was infested with snakes, so he spent the night in
the rafters. '

The next morning he was assigned to a labor gang as

"punishment. There were seven men and only six; shovels

(“typical Soviet efficiency,” said the interpreter) so he was

sent to get a shovel. It was then he decided to run.
He climbed a fence and then began crawling through a

ﬁeld to escape. Evading the helicopters searching_for him, -

he ﬂed to the nearby mountains where he was captured by
the “partisans,” the Moslem guerrillas.

Voromov was the ﬁrst non-Moslem Russian deserter ’
captured by the Afghan rebels not to be shot on the spot-

He said that the CIA had made a deal with the Afghans in
order to gain access to any captured Russians. As part of
the deal he was smuggled to a Pakistani border village in
return for munitions. »

Voromov lived in the village for four months until
interviewed by an American journalist. Through that
story,‘ the Senate granted him political asylum in the U.S.
His testimony before the Senate led to their voting $50
million in aid to the Afghan resistance. He is now living in
Washington, D.C. ' '

,Is be happy in America?

“No, not now," he said. ‘‘I have nothing here, no sup- ~

port, no money.” .
 ‘ He is homesick and misses his familyvery much, said

the interpreter. He wants very much to return to his home - V

town of Smolensk, but of course he cannot. He has
received two letters from his mother, but he suspects they
were not written by her. ' V

How does he look to the future?

“That ‘is hard to answer now,” Voromov replied. R '

“Right nowtthe future looks dark.” _ . .

“It is difﬁcult for a free people to imagine what it is
like,” Voromov said of his homeland. “They must expe-
rience it to understand.”

Rupp’s
skills
surpass

Big East

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Pitt women’s volleyball coach
Shelton Collier calls his setter “the
number one athleteof all volleyball
players in the Big East Conference.”
He is referring to 5-8 senior Cathy
Rupp, an honor student in adminis-
tration of justice who transferred
from Ohio two ‘years ago and is now
at the center of the Pitt offense.

“She came to Pitt as an average

“Pitt's success comes’
from caring about the
athletes and the‘ pro-
gram enought to get (a
coach) who really knows _
what he’s doing.”

— Cathy Rupp

setter and spiker but has really
worked at learning the setting posi-
tion and the strategy involved with
‘running an offense,” Collier said.
“It’s similar to a quarterback read-
ing defenses, and it takes a combina-
tion of experience, quick thinking,
and athletic ability. I‘ haven’t seen
anyone in the conference with as
much power, strength or overall skill
as Cat_hy._"> ,_ _ ,

Rupp was named to the All-
Tournament team at the Temple and
Louisiana State tournaments, and
led the LSU tournament with 23 ser-
vice aces. Her involvement in sports,
which as yielded the fruits of success
at Pitt, began on the courts of a
small school in Ohio.

Like many young girls, Rupp did
not have the luxury of a world full of

superstars as role models that her .

younger brother and neighboring
boys had. “I just sort of had this
thing about sports — sixth grade
manager for the high school teams
type of thing," Rupp said. “I guess I
was the typical tomboy.”

Rupp said that athletics for girls-

’and"women were slow in catching on
in Ohio. “Women’s‘ athletics were
almost nonexistent. There was a
Girls Athlet_ic Association, but it
wasn’t really developed. I didn’t go
to matches and say, ‘I want to be like
this.’ Ohio _just wasn’t that
advanced.” A

Athleticism runs in the Rupp fam- 0'

ily. Her parents were both good ath-
letes, and her brother -Jeff was a
wrestler on the Amateur -Athletic
Union circuit. “Jeff was a real good
athlete ‘but he got‘_burnt out really
young. He had done very well.”
Rupp set._for the Arehbold High
School team that won the Ohiostate
championship her. junior year and
was runner-up her senior year. She
said thatrshe was -not recruited by

‘ any colleges with well developed vol-
leyball programs, coming from the .

small community that she did.
‘‘I didn’t- know anything about
Pitt. I wasn’t approached by any of

the big schools, like"Oliio State or”

Pitt or Purdue,” she stated. She said
that the big schools generally did not
look in Ohio for quality‘ volleyball

players; consequently she attended

Ohio on a full scholarship.

Rupp said she has no regrets,

about leaving Ohio University, even
though she had to “pay over $8000”
the year she sat out; transfer stu-
dents must wait one year, during
which time period they may not
recieve scholarship money from
either the schoolthey left or the one
they will be attending.

“Pitt’s success comes from caring
about the athletes and the program
enough to get someone who really
knows what he’s doing," she said.
“We can always walk on the court
with confidence that -our coach can
play with -any team in thecountry.

We don’t have to worry about him‘

screwing up. Person for person, we
may not have the same talent as the
team-on the other side of the net,”
she said, but added that her team has
the unity and self-confidence to be
successful. . .

“Cathyhas had to abandon spik-
ing duties in favor of setting in all
rotations,” Collier‘ remarked. “I
think she probably misses spiking‘

‘ but enjoys controlling the match as

the only setter. lt’s a lot of responsi-
bility but she's doing a great job."
The team's‘ switch from the_6-2 to
the 5-1 is an unfortunate result of
Judy Young, setter and team cap-
tain, catching mononucleosis. Rupp
and Young would each spike part of
the time and set part of the time.
“When we were in a 6-2, you could

. -oeo-5‘

‘ - See page 14;

.2 am .

A

take out frustrations on the ball if
you had a bad rotation [setting],”
Rupp said. “You could say to the
setter, ‘Let me slam -some balls.’
Alone you have to somehow find a
way to get out of the rut, and it has
made me a stronger player."

It has also added responsibility.

“I always feel like I have responsi-
bility to the spikers if they hit into
the net. I always feel it should have
-been a_better set. I feel responsible
and that I should change
something.” _

Rupp said that another part of the
reason she transferred was aca-
demic. “I felt I was not getting quali-
fied. The program at O.U. was just
getting started and not really devel-

, oped yet.”

Maintaining an honors QPA is
extremely difficult for somestudent
athletes, but not Rupp. “lt’s an area
I'm interested in so it’s not difficult.
You enjoy learning if it’s an area
you’re interested in.” She said she
would like to further her education
in paralegal work or law school, pos-
sibly as a probation officer or else-
where in the judicial system.

Pitt beats CMU

By Kirsten Goston

The Pitt News '

' It was only fitting that a beautiful
fall day should turn dreary for the
crucial face-off between Pitt and
Carnegie-Mellon’s soccer teams
Tuesday afternoon. .

But.the sun shone brightly all day
on the Panthers as they defeated
CMU 4-2 to bring home an impres-
sive win. —

The game took on added signifi-
cance due to the approaching post-
season tournaments for both teams.
’A win for the Tartans would have
given them a berth in the NCAA
playoffs, while a Pitt victory would
have helped to assure them a spot in
the Big East Championships. Also at
stake were bragging rights as to “the
best soccer team in Pittsburgh,”
well, at least in Oakland.

“Right now we are on an emo-
tional high. This was probably our
biggest win all year,” said an exuber-
ant head coach Joe Luxbacher.
“We’ve been working hard all sea-
son, and today, our character
showed.” . -

Pitt was in control of the game
with a 2-1 lead at the half. The first
of the two Panther goals was scored
by freshman Craig Freund with an
assist from Scott Reiner. The second
score came on a Rick Burkholder
goal setup by Victor Hugo.

— The Panthers had hopes of sitting
on their lead, and did just that until
CMU sent the game into overtime
with a late goal. Then the game
should have ended. _

The referees made the decision to
halt the game due to the darkening

skies, but the teams pressured the

officials to allow a modified over- ‘

time of two five-minute quarters; At

the beginning of the ﬁrstovertime A ‘
Pitt had control of the ball but was -

unable to connect until Swarey
Karnara scored on a pass from
Hugo. .

The Panthers remained in control
the rest of the way in, toying with the
Tartans in the second quarter. Then
with 3:45 left in the ﬁnal overtime,
Dave Van Newkirkiced the game
with an unassisted goal. ,

“We're real happy with the win,
coming home with the win,” said
Reines. “They’ve been somewhat
sure of themselves all season, but we
proved it where it counts, on the
field." ’ '

Burkholder agreed. “We had a lot
to prove, because they’ve been talk-
ing a lot. But we were able to play
better. We didn’t rely on one person
and that’s the sign of a good team.”

Considering the aggressive nature
of the match, the Panthers kept their
composure remarkably well. “Des-‘
pite a rather physical, strong defense
we were able to play well together,"

bundu. “We’re looking forward to
making the Big East Championships
both for ourselves and as wg}l as for
Coach Luxbacher, and to accomp-
lish that would mean a great deal."

There is no denying that the team '

is playing better as the season wears

on. “The six plays we‘ve been work- ’ I

ing on all season are really beginning
to work,” said Freund. “I guess it’s
just a matter of time, but we're able

to prove that we’re,No.2 in Pitts-

burgh at least.”

Mix of veterans, frosh forecast sunny season

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

If you happen to be walking out of
Trees Hall in the next few weeks and
you notice a strange swishing sound
coming from the direction of Fitzge-
rald Field House, chances are it is
the _result of a basketball that came
off the hand of Jennifer Bruce, the
Pitt Lady Panthers’ all-everything
forward.

It is no wonder that Coach Judy
Saurer has been smiling a great deal
lately. She boasts a roster that
includes Bruce, the I984 Big East
Co-Player of the Year; Jenny Tyner,
the tallest player in the Big East;
eight returning letterwinners; and
two highly touted freshmen that

look to contribute immediately.

The Lady Panthers are currently
in preparation for their season
opener against St. Vincent's on
November 24 at Fitzgerald Field
House. “Enthusiasm” was just one
word Assistant Coach Kirk Bruce
used to describe the Lady Panthers.
Bruce commented, “Right now, we
are looking for the five players that
will work together the best.” Most
likely, that five will be headed by
senior co-captain Jennifer Bruce.
Coach Bruce noted, “Our squad is
comprised of mostly role players.”
His sister, Jennifer, can play all the

roles. Last year, she led the Lady
Panthers in scoring (23.8), rebound-
ing (9.4) and blocked shots (29)
while she established herself as the
premier player in the Big East. But
don’t get the idea that this is a one-
woman team.

Surrounding Bruce is a great deal
of experience. Stephanie Collins
will see time in the backcourt when
Pitt needs some outside shooting.
Collins is a pure shooter and may
prove to be the Lady Panthers’
zonebuster.

Is it defense you want? Lisa Fubio
will provide steals. She led the team
in steals last year with 60. Becky
Maziarz will get her share of takea-
ways also.

There will be a battle at the point
guard slot. Incumbent Kim Tirik
holds the Big East record for most
assists in a game with l2 and tied the
Pitt single—season record for assists
last year with I86. Tirik played in all
28 games last year, but she will be
challenged for the starting spot by
freshman Valerie Halesworth.
Halesworth is adept at both scoring
and passing. .

When you add senior Ellen Gil-
hooley across from Bruce, you have
an excellent one-two punch. Gilhoo-
ley has a devastating jump shot and
if the guards get the ball to her and
Bruce, there may be no stopping this
team.

The only void that Coach Saurer

had to really fill was at the center
position. Most likely to step in is
sophomore Jenny Tyner. Tyner
stands 6-5 and is the tallest player in
the conference. Saurer noted the
importance of Tyner's play: “Jenny
Tyner may be the difference in our

SAN DIEGO (UPI) — On Mon-
day night, the San Diego Chargers
were dismantled by the Seattle Sea-
hawks by the score of 24-0. It was the
first time that the Chargers had been
shut out since Oct. 7,-I979.

The Seahawks benefited from fine
performances turned in by their
defense, led by Kenny Easley and his
three interceptions, and by Dave
Krieg who passed for three touch-
downs, all to Pro-Bowler Steve Lar-
gent. Krieg completed 23 of 29
passes for 273 yards.

The loss dropped the Chargers
record to 4-5, which is good for last
place in the AFC Western division.

The victory lifted the Seahawks to
a 7-2 mark, tied with the Los

"The onus is on us."
, -— Jim O’Brien
Pitt Sports Information Director

 Time was — several years prior to

2 A the Johnny Majors era — when Jim

O’Brien bode his time sportswriting
for The Miami News and the New
York Post. They were not pretty

years for Pitt, as the Panthers turned ’

in scarred records of the 1-9, 3-8 and
l-l0 varieties. Starting to sound like
present-day 1984, isn’t it?
Regardless, O’Brien — during his
days as a scribe — never paid the
won-loss_column much due; he was
just interested in the team's perform-
ances against the opposition. He

spent his undergraduate days in
Oakland, began scribbling on these
very pages and had all the more rea-
son to catch the weekend scores of
the football program he used to
invariably cover.

He was also part of a minority, if
one ever existed. In the 10 or so years
between his graduation and the

Majors’ entrance, Pittsburghers,

found avoiding the Panthers an eas-
ier task than tying one’s shoelaces.

His two-year-old SID title aside,
the,43-year-old O’Brien still keeps
close tabs on Pitt football. But with
a 1-6-1 record to defend against, he
finds ‘himself in Va fourth-and-long
spot. Well, almost.

Since attendance levels at Pitt
Stadium arguably indicate the pro-
gram's appeal — or lack thereof —
O’Brien finds himself, as head of a
publicist staff, in a marketing

quandary.
Don’t be deluded, though. The
problem seems to have existed even

through the glorious Majors and.

Jackie Sherrill years. A recent
breakfast conversation between
O’Brien and offensive coordinator

Viewpoint

Joe Moore illustrated the point well:
Except for the West Virginias, Penn
States, Notre Dames and an occa-
sional Oklahoma, the true Pitt fans
can only be counted among the
30,000 or so who show for the

Harder to believe, perhaps, are
the 9 of 13 seasonal average crowd
records that have been set within the
last decade: 54,818 in ’82; 51,485 last
year; and the 50,860 in 81 serve as
the top three as only three others
came prior to 1974.

But wait, maybe Moore made
some sense of it all. Of the Panthers’
top nine crowds, only three haven’t
been against Notre Dame or Penn

State (Fordham, Nebraska and‘

Army being the others in ’38, ’37 and
’35, respectively). p

- Obviously ‘the visits by Illinois,
North Carolina and Florida State in
years past jack attendance levels up,
as do the excursions by UND, PSU
and WVU. Games against Louis-

,ville, Temple, Cincinnati or Army

just don’t cut it. In fact, it wouldn’t
be too presumptuous to state that

more to watch the nationally ranked
programs than the Panthers, though
Pitt has had similar, if not better,
status.

Now, that can't even be guaran- I

teed, as evidenced by home games
against Brighham Young (40,263),
Oklahoma (52,797~— why wasn't it
“sold out" at least?) and WVU
(58,032, despite an empty student
section).

Okay, so the numbers can get to i

be boggling. Enough of that. But the
question still remains: Why can’t
Pittsburghers find it in themselves to.

enjoy a Saturday afternoon out-~

doors? A 1-6-1 record doesn’t help,
but it isn't just this year. '

O’Brien readily shoulders all the
blame. He insists it is his ofﬁce’s
primary responsibility to make sure
Pitt Stadium ﬁlls to. the rafters.
Know how serious he is? By decade's
end, guided by an annual 10 percent
rise in season ticket sales, he projects
there will be 45,000 season ticket
holders. 0 .

Over the years, season ticket sales
have fluctuated _between 19,000 and
22,000. This season the ceilingwas
21,000, a 1200-ticket increase over
'83.

Maybe that‘s,a nice figure, but
given a new commitment, it’s pretty

pale‘. Consider: » g

0 Extensive facelift renovations at
Pitt Stadium, not including the
installation of turnstiles and upgrad-

' I ing of rest room and concession

stand services.
0 Efforts made between O’Brien’s
office and the Oakland—-Merchants

-Association to. attract and keep fans

in Oakland longer before and after
home games. ‘ _

0 Personal tours of the stadium
and other facilities guided by

O'Brien for grade school students,

civic associations and similar
groups. O’Brien also trafﬁes the ‘83
highlight film fairly heavily.‘ Upcom-
ing audiences include students from
Hampton Township, Turtle Creek

and children living in St. Clair -

Village. , -

0 ‘Excluding head coach Foge
Fazio’s two radio shows each week,
O’Brien’s» right-handman, Pat Han-
lo_n, gets on’ the horn several times
every week with various radio sta-
tions across the state. Notjust West-

ern Pennsylvania, but parts as far g 0

east as Harrisburg. .

0 And O’Brien takes care to spot

such minute things as ﬁlling the

backs of airline seats with leftover '

programs. Eastern and USAir are-
just two cooperating. '
Sounds like the whole show
hinges on O7Brien, though he admits
he could use a couple more salaried

,.sta_ff ‘people. “We're still learning” is

the phrase heard most often as of
late. Easilythe most perplexing item
O’Brien, continues to wrestle with
and find solutions for is c’ontinuing
high levels of student apathy.

A It afﬂiets this campus worsethan
the Towers’ food. During freshman
orientation some weeks ‘ago, part of
the program called for O’Brien to
show last season’s highlightﬁlm to
whoever wanted to view ‘it. ‘

Not a soul showed. _, ,

Wait, it gets better. Each year the
Student Activities Office places
9400 student season tickets on sale
on a first-come, first-serve basis.
One ticket per student. .The. price
went from $5 two years ago to the

present-day $9. That's an 80 percent-

hike, to cover printing costs, Pinker-
tons, ‘etc. Big deal. Students today,
as they have in the past, invariably
snatch up every single ticket for the
right to find a spot in sections 12 to
17 and part ofll. . '
Soewhat do-they do? As has also
been consistent in years past, an
average ‘of only 4500 actually turn
out for home garnes.Again, O'Brien
obligingly admits, “The onus is on
us,” to change that around. Early
tactics include pushing that high-
light film on campus before the stu-
dents; promoting awareness and
such through guided tours; and,

honest, having Fazio mingle more"

with_the students, including meeting
with individual fraternities.

dwellers should be no different.
Unfortunately, O’Brien might be
leading a lost cause here. As he bat-
tles tradition, a Pitt student was
recently quoted in The Miami News
as saying there's not any interest in
Pitt‘ football nowadays because’ of

‘ one win in seven games: You’re off-

base pal. Pitt could have been ll-l
— as it was for three straight seasons
— and average student attendance
would be half those tickets sold’
them. , \

It all puts the athletic director in
an interesting position after having
to cope with reduced income from‘
TV and burgeoning costs related to

coaches, recruiting, travel and God,

only knows.

“It may be disinterest," Pitt
Athletic Director Ed Bozik said yes-
terday, “but -I think we have to
market ourselves. It’s a problem
related to economic access, .getting
in-and out‘ of -the stadium and is a
problem when you’re competing for
the" entertainment dollar in a small
city. Well, relatively small‘, though}
don’t think that's it since most urban
institutions have [attendance] prob-
lems as well.”

Bozik advances not a bleak analy--

sis, but-a fair and accura_te one that
includes a higher attendence at Pitt
football games (the last decade) than
any other time period. A

Still, it is not enough, especially
for the $7 million budget Bozik
oversees.

“If everything goes right, you
could promote the idea of selling
30,000 [season tickets]," Bozik said
of his projection last spring, “But
fight now you don’t have the
ambience for it.,It’s a happening at
West Virginia or Penn State. People
use .the whole. day. I remember
attending a .press reception [at

one of the urban areas disadvan-
tages, but for every one of those
there is an advantage.”

Bozik’s comment aside, the lack-
of-parking issue is so dead it already
smells.~ If you want to see the Pan-

‘ thers play, you’ll find a way. Ticket
- prices have been reasonable at least.
All seats go for $13, with the 25,000
or so bet-ween the endlines going
especially to Golden Panther donors
who plunk down at_ least $250 per
top seat, excluding ticket prices. For
two or three games a year, youths
are. treated to $3 admission , days
which usually coincide with a pro-
motion. And if a group of 25 or more
assembles, the price per seat plunges

to $7. - ‘

' Explaining Pitt’s demise at the
gate is indeed difficult to diagnose,
especially the plight of the fickle stu-
dent. One thing is certain. With the
’84' home average at 42,456, the
Panthers are headed for the poorest
attendance finish since 1979 when an
average of 40,930 were bored by the
likes of Kansas, Boston College
(pre-Doug Flutie), Navy and
Syracuse. '
