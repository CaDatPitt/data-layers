Counsel Hired

A law firm whose members
contributed to Governor
Richard Thornburgh’s campaign
has been hired as bond counsel to
the Pennsylvania HigheriEduca-
tion Facilities Authority. _

“Under this administration.
the rule of thumb seems to be
that ify6u’re politically qualified
and if you’re connected, you get
thejob."’Craig Lewis. state sena-
tor from Bucks County said yes-
terday. ’ ~

T (iubernatoriai Press Secre-
tary. Paul Critchlow responded
by saying that ‘just as it would be —
wrong to appoint someone to an
important position who was not
qualified. it would be just as-
wrong todisqualifyalperson who
. is qualified just because he is a
friend and supporter." R

Student Protection. ‘

lllinois is so far the only state
in the country to take action to
protect its students from the
Reagan cutbacks in the federally
guaranteed student loan pro-
gram. according to James J.
Unland, director of public
finance for William Blair &
Company. a Chicago-based
banking and investments firm.

The plan. developed by the
lllinois Federation of Independ-
ent Colleges and Universities and
administered by a newly created
Higher Education Loan Author-
ity. provides students with a
direct grantwith only the pay-
ment of a service charge due

The state is seeking the death penalty for Sidney Brinkley,
a Pitt coed. A g A

By scor STONE

A recent Supreme Court decision
will force Pitt to disclose a wide
array of job-related data on the
faculties of four professional
schools. and pave the way for an
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) suit against
the university on sex-discrimination
charges on behalf of members of

‘Pitt’s School of Nursing.

On Monday. thecourt upheld a
March l7 ruling by the 3rd U.S. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals that required
Pitt to make available to federal
investigations information on the
sex. salaries and job discriptions of
faculties within the health science
schools. for comparative purposes.

According to federal court offi-
cials in Pitsburgh. this action allows
the EEOC to prepare its case against
Pitt.

The suit itself stems from a sex

EEOC in I977. '

Upon learning of the high court‘s
decision. the ANA responded with a
strong statement of support for the
action.

“The American Nurses ‘Associa-

Deliberations are scheduled to‘
resume today for ajury charged with

T deciding whether convicted mur- _
derer Sidney Brinkleyishould receive 

a first degree murder conviction.
and possibly. the death sentence.

Common Pleas Court Judge
Ralph Cappy told the jury ofjsix
men and six women that “no one
ever told you it would be easy."after
they had deliberated for 4'/3 hours-
and were unable to «reach a verdict. »\

The state is seeking the ‘death
penalty for Brinkley. a 26-year-old
former Philadelphia construction
worker accused of robbing. raping
and strangling Pitt ‘coed Monica
Renee Jones in the basement of a
Pitt dormitory in January of I979.‘

Assistant District Attorney
Robert Vincler based much of his
case on a confession Brinkley gave
to city police and a writtten state-
ment he made to Philadelphia detec-
tives in the fall of'l979.

Brinkley never took the stand. but
his statements were readto the court
by the police officers.

According to Brinkley's confes-V
sion. hewas in a car parked in the .
garage beneath: P,itt’s Litchfield
Towers with his girlfriend. Estielle
Hill. on the night of Jan. 3 when the
murder‘alledgedly occurred.

Brinkley. who shared Hill’s Tower
B room, in _violation_,ot7 Pitt’s’ dorm
visitation policy. said that he and‘
were reading pornographic
magazines. He said he leftthe car to
go to the dormitory room and get *
more magazines..and that when he
returned. Hill was sleeping.

Brinkley told the police he went_to
the Towers laundry room. which

was then located in the basement.
g. According

to ‘his statement,

Brinkley spoted Monica Renee

Jones-a Pitt student Hill had ear-

lier identified to him as a high school

classmate of hers---— in the laundry

room.

Salary

The Supreme Court’s “decision
against Pitt came as a result of a
June l8 ruling in favor of female pri-
son guards claiming the right to the
same pay as male guards on the
grounds that they performed similar
work. This strategy of comparison .
as a basis for equal-pay-for-equal-
work suits. is a significant new devel-
opment in the field.

According to sources in Washing-
ton. the .lune 8 ruling “opened a new’
avenue for the‘ use of comparative
statistics in sex-based. wage-bias
cases." i

According to Hannan. the univer-
sity is not commenting on the court
ruling. or on any other aspect ofthe
case while it is still in litigation.

The next stop in the legal process
is the suit itself. Hannan said that it

is impossible to tell when that/would

occur.

“It could be six months. a year.
even something crazy like two‘
years." Hannan said. “

The assassination yesterday of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
will probably lead to a struggle to
topple the now-fragile Egyptian
government, according to Pitt polit-
ical science professor Richard
Cottam.

Cottam, an internationally recog-
nized expert on the Middle East,
said at a press conference here that

two groups, the intelligentsia and
religious fundamentalists, will

strugglewith the current gOvern— ,

ment, now headed by Hasni
Mobarak. He said the ability of the
opposition groups to mobilize is
unknown. ,

“lfthe government is to remain in
power,” Cottam said, “it will have to
immobilize these (groups)." He said
itgcould be accomplished through

brutality Or through the release Of~

those jailed by Sadat.
Success of the final implementa-
tion Of the Camp David accords,
negotiated‘ by former President
‘Jimmy Carter, will depend- on
4 whether the new government can

stabilize.

“I think if the (Mobarak) regime

can stabilize, they will try to hang on
‘to the accords," Cottam said.’

If either of the factions is success-
ful in'its attempts, there will be a
break from Israel, Cottam said.

  Sadat’S Murder:What Now?  

Dr. Richard Cottam

The professor said he is led to
believe that the assassins" were Mos-
lem fundamentalists because news
reports said they were willing to die
themselves. The military, he said,
likes to see the fruits of its labor.

"There is a distant possibility ofa
return to the policies of Gamal
Abdel Nasser, Sadat‘s predecessor,

Dr. Joseph Eaton

Cottam said, but the more likely’

possibility is a return to fundamen-
talist ideology. He added‘that there
is no dominant religious figure in
Egypt; therefore. there is an “even
chance" of a religious takeover.
ltwas a mistake, Cottam said, for
United States policies in.the Middle
East to rely so heavily On one man,

a former colonel in the Egyptian
Army and currently a student in the
Graduate School of
International Affairs.

Zhony said the assassination did
not come as a surprise to him. He
cited three groups that could have
been responsible: Moslem funda-
mentalists supported by Iran's Aya-
tollah Khomeini and Libya's Col.
Moammar Khadafy; a group with
support from an exiled Army Gen-'
eral oracombined effort. Headded
it is unlikely that it was an individual
act.

(An organization that identifed
itself as the “Independent Organiza-

tion for the Liberation of Egypt“ ‘

claimed responsibility for the ass-
assination earlier yesterday.)

, Zhony said that if Mobarak
wants to remain in power, he must
move away from Sadat’s policies.
Cottam said that‘ “Mobarak is not
strong," according to the people
who know him. A

Zhony described the situationas
“critical."

Several GSPIA faculty members
also commented on the implications
of the assassination, all emphasizing
the role of the military.

Don Goldstein of GSPIA said

that “the military will determine

what happens” because they are the
only stable group within the coun-
try. Mobarak does not have the
charisma that Sadat had, he added.
and that the situation is now one of
“watchful waiting.” A

He added that the United States
has lost a “goodi‘friend" and “cor-
nerstone" of its Middle East policy.

Joseph Eaton said the army, in
fact , will decide who will succeed

0 Sadat. Further, he said. he thinks

the Reagan administration will try
to reduce risks to the region by
backing any regime sympathetic to
the Sadat cause. Eaton also called
for a re-examination of U. S. mil-

‘ itary policy toward the Middle East.

He said the assassination is “cer-
tainly unlucky for the president" in
terms of the debated sale of
AWACS to Saudi Arabia.

GSPlA’s Hector Correa pointed
out that the U. S. is not paying
enough attention to the Arab world
which limits U.  policy options in
the Middle East.

019603 Radical Speaks Out Against Capitalism

The veteran of political radicalism
and leader of the All-African Revo-
lutionary Front expressed hatred for
capitalism and urged its overthrow.
He was-also critical of some Ameri-
can policies.

To accomplish the overthrow of
capitalism. the “constant political
education” ofthe people would have

‘to be changed, according to T-ure.
.He contended that “constant politi-
cal education” is a practice the U.S.
government uses to exploit and con-
fuse its people. i »

“Ever since we’re 6. we‘ve heard of
Coca-Cola. and even though every-
one knows about Coca-Cola.'the

television. because there is constant care and will not stand for“capitalist

education.“ he explained.

"The American people think they
think. but in reality they react to
material stimuli."

This exploitation leads to naivete
among the people. Ture cited the
Vietnam war as an example of both
American consciousness and Amer-
ican gullibility. ‘

“We‘re told to fight communism
and that communism is bad and (we

‘\should) send soldiers to Vietnam to

fight. But if you ask those soldiers
what communism is. they couldn’t
tell you. they've been programmed.”

lnthe U.S. however, the protests

over the controversial war were indi-_V

cations that the American people

The problem. Ture said. is that we
have to keep the protests going.
unlike what happened in the Viet-
nam era. when the protests subsided
as soon as /the American involve-
ment in the war ended.

“Capitalism is like a snake. it
retreats when faced with strong
opposition but comes back stronger
than before when the enemy lets his
guard down." Ture warned.

Ture told the crowd to be fearful
ofthe Reagan administration. for it
will try to implement a draft. A draft
could only lead to more oppressive
tlreatment of- nations abroad.

  Pitt Doctors Study Smelting  

‘I

F.

it:

By MIKE MALLINGETR

Two Pitt scientistshave received a
grant that will ‘fund research to
determine whether fumes from
copper and zinc smelting plants

cause cancer and subsequent death

in workers.

Dr. Philip Enterlineofthe depart-
ment of biostatistics and Nurtan
Esmen, professor of industrial and
air engineering, have contracted
with the Smelter Environmental
Research Association, an industry
organization, which awarded them
$450,000 for the study. _

.Enterline found in an earlier study
that smelter workers “without
exception (have) shown some excess
in lung cancer.”

The two researchers have been
reviewing data for only a few
months, and the completion date for
the studyis set for I983.

The data include the occupational
and medical histories of more than
l8,000 workers who labored in
smelting plants in Monaca. Pa.,
Arizona. Nevada, Tennessee and
Utah.

According to Esmen, the data on
each worker are first classified using
a number of variables. These varia-
bles include the types ofchemicals to
which each worker was exposed, the
cumulativeeffect of those chemicals
on mortality, the worker’s specific
job in the plant. if

The methodology then is “to clas-

sify the workers in certain uniform»

jobs, knowing what the worker did
and then goback to the plants’
records to see ‘how the job has
changed,” resulting in an estimate of
that workers overall exposure,
Esmen said. ’

Love, your sisters and winter pledges
of DELTA ZETA

are really psyched to have you

. The correlation between a
worker’s exposure to fumes and
death determines the cause ofdeath.
which is then compared with the
mortality rates for the population in
general. he added.

If the scientists can show such a
cause-and-effect relationship. then
they can prove that a level of each
chemical is significant in a specific

_ form of death. This discovery allows

industry to eliminate any fumes
above a safe level, Esmen said.

He stated that the smelting indus-
try sghould know which fumes are
dangerous to workers as part ofbus-
iness and should make any changes
necessary before the industry is
forced to make thechanges.

When asked whether the nearly

_ half-million dollar smelter industry

contract would result in a report

‘favorable toward industry, Enter-

liné replied. “we’re going "to make
sure that it isn’t biased.” .

Enterline asserted that the smelt-
ing industry is not looking for easy
answers.

“l think industry wants to face the-

truth because what they find out is
that it’s going to catch them eventu-
ally," Enterline said. 7

He cited the asbestos industry as
an industry that’ failed to rid its’
workplaces of dust and now faces
lawsuits by workers exposed to dust
over a period of years.

Other industries have improved
safety after observing the asbestos
industry’s problem. Enterline said.

“The company is willing to do

anything that is necessary, but they '
have to make sure that it is really’

needed." he added.

“These workers are working
under conditions that appear to be
safe. People are not dropping dead.
There are no'situations that I know
of in semlters where there have been
acute deaths.“ Enterline said.

Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health has pioneered these kinds of

studies, according to Enterline,
beginnning with studies of steel-,

workers about I0 years ago, and
more recently it has completed a
study on copper smelting for the
National Cancer lnstitutelij

Pozorski said, were used to fashion‘
the portable art such as jewelry.

Photos of cave paintings from the
Alta Mira cave in Spain and the Las-
caux and LaMadeleine caves in
France are on display. as well as
reproductions of actual cave scenes.
One ceiling painting has been sus-
pended overhead to simulate the
original. g

Cave painters were aided by the
availability of natural pigments such
as manganese. Some painters/app-

L lied these colorings directly to the

cave walls or kept the color in
powder form and blew it through a
tube onto the wall to achieve nega-

tive prints or what can be r-oughly 2

described as outlines. Pozorski said.
“The people who created this art
were full human’ beings, Homo
sapiens sapiens. not Neanderthals.
Man. in fact. has not evolved since
thattime. This is essentially modern
man‘-s first art." Pozorski said. 1

Many people spend their lunch
hours gobbling burgers and fries or
yogurt and granola and then strol-
ling around Oakland. But there are
others who feed their brains as well
as their stomachs by attending
“Ethics for Lunch” twice a month at
Presbyterian—University Hospital.

“Ethics for_Lunch" is a three-year-
old noontime lecture and discussion
series about moral problems in
health care.

“lt‘s designed to attract virtually

.\ anyone in or out ofthe medical cen-
' ter in a relaxed discussion ofvarious

topics over lunch." said James G.

‘Lennox, assistant professor inthe

history and philosophy of science
department at the University of
Pittsburgh. who was primarily
responsible for setting up this year’s
program.

This year‘s agenda includes talks
by local physicians on“‘Dilemmas of
Technological Medicine in Develop-

ing Countries,” “Involvement of

Physicians in Social Controversies.”

Brinkley’s
Fate  

r'onIinuea’from ;2iigt> one

‘A

Brinkley said he followed Jones
out ofthe laundry room to the step
near the cafeteria. where he grabbed
her and strangled’ her until she was
unconscious. c

He then dragged her to a trash-
room where he strangled her two
more times. using anelecrical cord.

“I had like this ironing cord, but
thick." Brinkley’s statement read. “I
strangled her until she was
unconsciouis." ii

He said he also beat. and raped
her. sexually assaulting her with a
broom handle before taking her keys
and‘ identification. and stuffing
some of her clothing in a laundry
bag. .

Hill testified on Monday that
Brinkley appeared nervous when he
returned to the car. He drove the car
around the block and threw the bag

_of clothes away. she said.

Three Philadcpphia detectives
testified that they found Jones’ keys
in Brinkley‘s Philadelphia apart-
ment that he shared with Hill in the
fall of 1979. They said the keys fit the
locks of doors in Jones’ home.

Defense attorney Cook said in his
closing arguments that thejury must

i be sure beyond a reasonable doubt

that Brinkley intended to kill Jones.
He said prescribing a first-degree
conviction could be the result of a
“knee-jerk" reaction.

‘‘It’s not necessary to return a
first-degree murder conviction to
establish the appreciation for the
seriousness ofthe crime.“Cook said.

He added Brink|ey's intention was
to rape Jones. but in the process. he
killed her. Thus. (‘ook argued the
crime deserves a second-degree
murder conviction.

Vincler however. said the alleged
murder was pre-meditated. B

“Would someone stranglean indi-
vidual three times just to rape
them?" he asked. “Where did he get
the cord he used to strangle her‘? He
had enough foresight to pick up a
murder weapon.“

lhe jury has been seqttcstered
throughout the case because (‘zippy
ruled they are not permitted access
to information about Bt'inkle_v\
three other com ietions.

Brinkley has been convicted of

killing two other women ittclttdiiig

 A Model
  Corporation

After four years, the “preliminaries,”as Pitt counsel
William Hannan called them, are over.‘

The “preliminaries were a long and very complex
series of legal manuevers between the University of
Pittsburgh and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission overthe disclosure, by Pitt, of extensive L

‘ job-related statistics on thefaculties of four profes- 1
sional schools; '

' The final decision, reached Monday by the Supreme
Court, upheld a lower court ruling that ordered Pitt to
release. its records to the EEOC.

Now that the two sides are warmed up, the main
attraction—a sex-discrimination suit against Pitt--
Qcan beadvanced. The EEOC needs the statistics,’
which includes pay scales and the gender composition
of several schools, in order to prepare its case. against
A the university. -

The EEOC, on behalf of 29 current and former
faculty members of the School of Nursing, is charging
that Pitt discriminates against women by paying them
less than male counterparts performing similar work
in related fields. \ ‘

The principle of comparison as astrategy in sex-
related wage-bias .. cases was established by the
Supreme Court last June when it ruled in favor ofa,
group of female prison guards claiming the right to

- receive equal pay for similar, though not exactly the
same, work as their male counterparts. A

What is disturbing about this whole debate is not the
particular claims and issues of one side or the other,
but an underlying attitude on the part ofthe university

—t in their handlingof the case. I ‘

It seems that Pitt is indifferent to,,the moral and
' ethical charges leveled against it. Rather than fespond-
ing directly to the allegations of sex—discrimination. it ‘
girds its substantial array‘ of legal muscle and prepares
‘ to settle into an interminable quagmire of legal’
manuevering. 9

As an institution, it appears logical that it should
respond in such a manner, after all, it is most likely
that a giant like Pittwould be able to outlast the puny
annoyance ofa group of individuals or even a govern-

" . ’ ment agency. But in addition to being alarge institu-
tion, Pitt is also a university. As such, certain. ideals
come into play that removesjudgement of its actions
from -the simple Darwinisms of life in the private

" sector. *

The university is a model for the larger community
that surrounds it. it is bound by its mission and its
nature to act differently than other institutions. The
sight of Pitt behaving in the manner of a cynical and
profit—conscious corporation can be of little use~to its
students and members of the community who look to
that institution for signs of hope and compassion in
overly competitive and pressure-laden society.

when they slyly open that window. 9
To add credibility to my position.‘

l traveled to an abandoned monas-
tery somewhere beneath Bracken-
ridge Hall. lnthe ancient archives l
found a very old book written by
Orvill Reed Leviticus and printed by
Housingpun Industries./,The book,
Ethics of Window Bombing. _con-
tains..an in-depth study-of the. do’s
and"d6'n’ts for Quad Bombers.
Hereis a brief rundown of Leviti-
cus‘imora| code: '

himself by throwing rocks or sticks
atapproaching danger..Asthe Quad
grew. primitive man took to its
higher regions. The aerial view
accompanied by the brick and stone
surrounding him gave him a feeling
of security. With the advent oftech—
nology. primitive man decided he
wanted a bigger brain. t
Upon receiving a bigger brain he
’ soon learned to distinguish between
friend and foe. friend being human.
foe being any rabid dog or other
creature that doesn’t Know enough

/ to feel the pain when a dangerous

object or substance knocks his her
its brains in. i . _;

‘'But.‘‘‘' wrote Leviticuis/i. “some
primitive men never received bigger
brains and have thus stayed’ primi-
tive and mindless." V

These mindless primitive morons
have been known to throw beds.
doors. furniture and other haiinful
objects. Such a practice has the
potential -for ruining the artol‘ win-
dow bombing for everyone con-
cerned. It is, one thing to scare a

‘victim but it is another to kill or
cripple.

minated. Although Leviticus never
stated how M.P.M.s should beidone
away with. l'm sure he'd be amena-
ble to throwing M.P.M.s out of the
Quad windows as long as only a
M.P.M. is struck and killed below.

2) A window bomber must be able
to select the proper device in order to
avoid prosecuti_on. lt is downright
stupid to throw anything that could
cause _ broken’ bones, blood. or
death.‘-But one/must also be-careful
to match the intended target with the
proper form of weaponry. For
instance, it would beunethical to
launch an attack 'on a lone, neatly
dressed, book-carrying. shy college
girl~ but it’s completely justifiable
to silence a loud and boisterous

crowd by seynding down a volley of A

wet toilet paper. Remember, how-
ever. that one‘s attack mustbe
calculated. A

it 3) It_ is absolutely immoral‘ to

. intentionally aim and hit someone.
Window bombing is an art. The act. _,

of bombing is only meant to remind

the ‘person of his or her existence.

‘Therefore, direct hits will be consi- s

dered dishonorable and stupid.

4) The cardinalsin and theactthat
most shames and degrades one’s
character is to drop a bomb of any
nature out of a pre-opened window.
In the Old West it was considered
dirty and cheap to shoot someone in
the back. If one chooses toattack at
least give fair warning~;—The sound of

.an opening window is a beckoning
3 call for the victim to “face" his‘

attackers.

Leviticus wrote that an in-depth,
study‘ of his a Ethics of/' Wimlow
Bombing is essential for any serious
bomber. As of now, there is no Stan-
ley Kaplan course that will teach
dignified and proper window bomb-

ingiiin eight easy lessons.

To bomb is easy. To get hit is even
easier. Don‘t throw what you your-‘

’ self wouldn’t.want to get hit with. Of

course’ that doesn’t apply to the
mindless primitive morons. I‘m sure
they‘d love to have just about any-

/thing “kaboom" on their heads.

You’re The On-e.»ABC --—

Dear Editor: .

We. the ‘ members of the Pitt
Athletic Boosters. urge all Pitt fans
to follow our example and send let-
ters voicing their discontent about

ABC’s ludicrous handling ofithe'

Oct. 3 Pitt-South Carolina football
game. Letters should be sent to
ABC. I330 Avenue of Americas.
New York. NY l_()()l9. A

This is the only way thatvwe as
viewers can make-oifr views known
to mentally deficient network
executives.

If there are Pitt fans who would
like to writea letter, but do not have
the time. we would be happy to send
a copy of the letter below on your
behalf. Just send a stamp to Box
2993. Campus Mail.

“Corky" Cvrkel. President
Robert J. Querio, Business Manager
Pitt Athletic Boosters

(The/'(2lloii'ing letter was sent ear-
lier this week to A BC-TV by the Pitt
A tliletic Boosters. )

Thank you very much. ABC. We
really enjoyed your regional cover-
age ofthe Pitt-South Carolina game
on Saturday, Oct. 3.

Your coverage was very
imaginative that is. we had to use
our imagination in order to enjoy
the game. Perhaps we misunder-
stood your advertisements. We
assumed that “regional coverage of
the game" was coverage of the‘ent‘ire
game. not just the first quarter.

Your sportscastersghad promisedi

» ,  , 3 K ..

to return to the game if it had
become more competitive. Had this
game become any more competitive
it would have turned into a boxing
match. which at one point itdid. On
Sept.‘ 26, however. you presented..\
coverage of the entire North
Carolina-Boston College game. The
Boston College cheerleaders offered

_more resistance than the school’s

football team did.

We do not understand the logic.
or lack thereof. behindithis decision.
Ourlocal ABC affiliate, WTAE. had
originally scheduled to televise the
game at 7p.m. You, however, pulled
rank and decide to show the game
regionally at 3:45p.m. You then
yanked the game despite the cost of

the setup, which was paid for by

your advertisers. ‘Were these same
advertisers. who paid for the cover-

’ age. a part of this decision. or were

they deceived as we were?

You advertised the Pitt game
heavily throughout the afternoon.
t_hereby “baiting" the viewers. and
then “switched” to anotherregional
contest. which is a fraudulerit prac-
tice by FTC advertising standards.

Until this fiasco. we had held high
regard for ABC‘s quality program-
ming. ()ur opinion of your network
has dropped a full I00 percent fol-
lowing _vour hasty and insensitive

decision. Nothing short of a public .
apology would restore our faith in

you and your advertisers.

International Studies Center

  Pr°m°tingUnde-Handing

Burkart Holzner. the director of ‘,

Pitt’s University Center for lnterna-
tional Studies. sits at the end of a
long confe_rence table on the ninth
ﬂoor of theiLearning and Research

iDevelopmen.t Center-—“the funny-

looking building next to Western

Psych‘ that goes sideways instead of.

straight up,” as students often say.
To Hol7.ner’s right ‘and front is

' seated a cross-section of ‘scholars

from American and foreign univer-
sities attending the final session ofa
UClS— and Graduate School of Pub-
lic ‘and lnternational Affairs-
sponsored conference, “The
American-German Conference on

E ‘Utilization of Knowledge Acquired

Abroad.”
= To his left, beyond the room’s
thick glass windows. is the Oakland

landscape: the medieval. towering

Cathedral of Learningfthe Towers
dormitories. resembling cleanser.
containers‘; and the Carnegie-

. Mellon University campus. Farther

are the smokestaeks ofthe steel mills
along the Monongahela River.
Holzner is reading from a paper
on “The Cross-Cultural Aspects of
Knowledge Transfer.” lifting his
head occasionally to gauge reactions
.-‘of his colleagues.
‘*2’ in his characteristically thick Ger-_

Jvan accent. he refers to “structural

ii '3’, ifferentiation ofthe social system."

«ri._§.i*-"‘limited structural convergence”

.  and “internalization -of the national.

_ knowledge systems“—-~ definitely not

the material covered in an “Intro-
duction to World Cultures” class.
No. this is heavy stuff. but. for

that matter. so is most ‘of what

makes up Pitt’s Center for lnterrna-

_ tional Studies.

The cerrter is a sort of umbrella
organization for a variety of pro-
grams. that center on the research

' and intellectualdevelopment of for-
. eignstudies and cultures‘ and how

those developments affect the world
as a whole.’ » ’ -

UCIS is as Holzner describes it.»

“an assemblyof many different pers-
pectives that together--allow us to
understand with greater accuracy-
and scope what‘s going on around
the world.” ,

The programs of UCIS fall under
the general heading of area studies.
The three major area studies pro-
grams of-UClS are Russian and East
European Studies, Latin American
Studies and Asian Studies.

But it doesn’t stop there. Interna-
tional studies at_Pitt'also can be
found in the controversial Semester
at Sea program. which returned
homeifrom its maiden v.oyage under
the sponsorship of Pitt this summer.
and the Pennsylvania Ethnic Herit-
age Studies Center. created by the
Pennsylvania General Assembly
and the State Department of Educa-
tion in l974 to collect and’ publish
information‘ on‘ the state's ethnic

heritage. A
The center was’ founded in I968
“to establish a focal point of all the
academic international activities of‘
the university” and. to serve as “a
home for research and interdiscipli-
nary area programs.” Holzner
explained. _
Originally directed by the late
Carl Beck. who died in I979. and
co—director Paul Watson. a basic
organizational structure emerged
that remains intact today.
Perhapsthe most distinguishing
aspect of the center's organization is
its ability to cut across disciplinary
lines--into the medicine and engi-
neering schools, for example.’ or the
College of Arts and Sciences.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. one of
the original founders and long-time
supporters of the center. describes
the interdisciplinary dimension of
UClS as “unique among interna-

.,tional study centers and universi-
- I ties” across the country.

“it's pervasive and horizontal."
Posvar said. “It fcuts across the
schools and departments and coor-
dinates-‘and acts as a catalyst sup-
porting people in all fields.” L

Centers at universities such as the
University of Chicago. Harvard.
UCLA_. and MlT“‘\‘are more like ver-
tical departments.” he said. “in

. which a group of experts are set

aside and removed from their col-
leagues in politicalscienceor history

Studies T Weinschenkerphoto

or sociology and interact within a
small circle. '0’ur center transcends
allthat. and l think it's acquired a
truly powerful position of national
leadership because of that.”

So. for example. medical students
might have the opportunity to study

' medical ethics of other countries. or
i an engineer could study design tech-

niques of foreign cultures through
UCIS-coordinated courses.

This horizontal structure is very
important in an age ofspecialization
“where the hierarchical structure of
the university setsitself off so that

people don’t talk to each other very

much 'across departmental and
school boundaries." Holzner said.
The ‘structure “allows us to
respond to new intellectual issues
and challenges'“‘in a way that can
draw on"t'he resources of different
disciplines" he added. A i
There are three broad responsibil-
iti‘t:s of the center. according, to
Holzner: y ' ‘
-Curriculum and
Even though the centerdoes not give
degrees. it does have some responsi-
bility within its area studies centers
of creatingand coordinating courses
of instruction
—Research. A majority of the
center's resources and efforts is
devoted toward development of
research. the results of which are
later published in journals or dis-
cussed at seminars. conferences and
policy forums. A "
-i-Outreach and public service.
This aspect of the center is the most
visible and. by some accounts. the
most important. It is because ofthe

t outreach programs. directed prim-

arily by Jonathan Flint. that under-
graduates and highschool students
are introduced to foreign curricula
and speakers. Local businessmen
have the opportunity to attend
seminars on other countries. and
foreign film series are presented.
"UCIS has from the very begin-
ning accepted the responsibility for
serving not only the iiniversity but

- .. also «to bring the intemational;imel- .

leetual resources of the university to
bear on such issues as the improve-
ment of curriculum in schools. and

to service the needs of the general

public. the business community.
labor unions and ‘the like.” Holzner
said. i

It isn‘t enough just to sit in on a
lecture. or watch a film. however.
its facing up to the hard realities-—
how different countries affect each
other. how they are interdependent.
how they can destroy each other
that is
important. V

This is-primarily what the center is

emphasizing through its outreach“?-

programs. Holzner explained.
“It is our responsibility to identify

priorities, to put them into the pub-

lic debate within the university com-
munity and to advocate the point of
view that international’ studies.-lan-
guage studies and international
understanding are ofextreme practi-
cal importance." Holzner said. “And
they will become more importantas
the years go on. as we become more
interdependent.“

The center. along with the inter-
national studies departments and
faculty of the other large universities
in the state. is also actively involved

in Gov. Richard Thornburgh‘s prtw

gram to attract more foreign invest-
ment into the state and export more
state products to foreign markets.
The primary objective, of the
state's program is to create jobs for
Pennsylvanians. But the Commerce
Department. charged with imple-
mentation of the program. is so

i small that it is forced to take advan-

tage of the schools‘ international
resources.

So. over thepast year. a series of
meetings have been held between
state officials and representatives of
these universities. The
meeting. held last month. was

‘ “technical review of how wouldyone

make an inventory of the interna-
tional resources of the four major

Despite the loss of funds for the
Russian program. Holzner said the
center has been successful in-attract-
ing funds overall. Tom McDechnie,
associate director of UClS. said fed-
eral grants to the center and its pro-
grams will total $343,657 for fiscal.
year l982.

 

Evenwith the slowdown of/fed-
eral funds coming into the center,
Holzner said he is not too worried
about that source of funding. given
the Reagan administration's priori-
ties on international affairs.

effort, private foundation, non—

sources of funding. 3

"Alan Adelman, associate director and outreach coordinator

continued from page !ii'eI\'e_
ple and the University of Pennsylva-
nia).” Hol7.ner said. “

There are hazards involved in,this ‘

close - relationship with business.
Hoizner admitted. citing a possible
loss of identity. /

While UClS‘wants to expand its
cooperation with business. it must
also keep in mind its role as strictly
an academic institution.

“We want to be careful that eve:
ryone understands that we are not a
business firm. The frames of refer-
ence of academic institutions and
business firms are necessarily differ-
ent.” Holzner said.

‘-‘So we want to be quite clear that
our primary responsibility is scho-
larship and teaching and dedication
to the academic point of view."

All this is fine.-a skeptical student’
might say. but what is Pitt‘s interna-
tional studies finding out about the
world'.’\

' Well. Holzner responds. there are
many things going on in.the world
today. but what eyeryone seems con-

cerned aboutis the arms race and the '

Cold War rhetoric between the
superpowers.

Yet. ‘under the shadow of these
threats. as Holzner describes it, is a
revolutiongin worldwide communi-
cations.-

“lt‘s in part a technological revo-
lution; it’s in part a change in the
mentality of people who are dealing
with scientific research. technology
and social science.” Holzner said.
“They're becoming much more
orientated beyond national boun-
daries to their counterparts in other
countries.“

Hzi\‘in'g heard Hol‘/ner‘s answerto
that question. that same skeptical
student might say. ‘‘I‘m a pre—med or
pre-law student. and l‘m hzixing
enough problems in the courses l
need for post-graduate \\'0l‘l~l. let
alone international studies."

ln that case. it's a matter of laying
claim to being a well-educated and a
well-rounded person. Hol‘/.ner said.
if one doesn’t know. for instance.
what a dynasty meant in China. or
where the history of Vietnaﬁiese

Y eitpansitin into (‘anibodia began. or. T‘

more recently, why the United
States has sent military advisers to
El Salvador. then you “can’t claim
very well to being a well-educated
person.” i

The international changes that
have developed in about the last l5
years through the expansion of

‘international communication net-

works and the subsequent intensifi-

cation of ‘scientific and economic
relationships betweennations imply
a completely different rewards sys-
tern. Holzner asserted. '

“Our responsibility is to do our
best to try to monitor what is emerg-
ing outthere. to see how we can
formulate the emerging understand-

ing of these realities and communi-

cate that to our -students.” he said,

One of the ways international
studies- and, eventually UCIS.-is
manifesting itself at Pitt is in the
proposed College of Arts and Scien-
ces curriculum changes.

T “The study of foreign cultures,
like language study. can liberate the
student from the crippling effects of

’ cultural paro'chialis.m/”’the Commit-

tee on Curriculum Reform wrote in
its report to the faculty.

“in today‘s world.” the report
continues, “where we are increas-
ingly brought into contactwith a
wide diversity of cultures‘. the reali-
zation of these goals requires that

student have some understand-
ing not only of our close cultural
relatives but ofcultures from outside
the tradition of Western Civilization
as well.“

Changes in foreign language and
cultural studies requirements would
have students. among other things.
satisfactorily complete at least a
term of study in a study-abroad pro-
gram or demonstrate advanced lan-
guage proficiency six credits beyond
the elementary level in a foreign lan-
guage. Faculty will vote on the pro-
posed changes Oct. l().

UCIS can study as much as a for-
eign culture as it wants. Whether or
not an individual faculty member
gets paid for it. however. is another
matter. ‘

Thegkussian and East European
Studies program received quite a
shock this summer when it found
out the program‘s federal support

was discontinued for this year.»  .- .

l

“One ofithe haiards of interna-
tional research and education.” he
said. “is that it really does challenge

what‘ might otherwise be a rather ’

inward-looking view of self and

society. The hazard might be that.

you come back with an enlarged
horizon ofthe location in which you
are. historically and culturally. Its
impact is one of expansion: your
horizons are never really the same.”

The Pitt /Vilewx, ‘Wednes-da_i', October 7. [98]

BY LISA GRENEVICKI

In a sport where most of the
glory’ is in scoring goals. playing
defense can be a disappointment.
Pitt goalkeeper Scott Thunberg
takes it in.stride.

Thunberg. nicknamed "Tune"
because his name is pronounced
“Thunberg” and no one ever gets
it right. has been the Pitt soccer
teams starting goalie for’ most of
his four years on the team.

A starter as a freshman, Thun-
berg credits former Panther
goalie. Frank Bucci for his help
and coaching. Bucci had an
excellent career at Pitt. setting
the Panther record for most
career shutouts (I4) before he
went on to the pros.

“Bucci helped me out the
most," said Thunberg. “In high
school. I picked up things by
reading about goalkeeping. but
most of all by trial and error. In
high school. I would have 40-45
shots taken on goal a game. With
that many coming at you. you
learn what works and what
doesn‘t. ‘

“When.l came to Pitt. Bucci
helped to mold me into a college
goalie." P 4

To be a good goalkeeper isn't
that easy. According to Thun-
berg. it’s the mental pressure of
the position that makes it so
difficult. -

“All you have to do is make

‘ one mistake and yo_u can let a

berg.*'—"lhere‘s nothing you can

that hurts even worse.

“As long as the team is win-
ning, it‘s great. but the goalie
rarely getsthe creditforawin. As
soon as the team loses. the goalie
is usually the man they point to.
It's all mentally tiring.” Thun-
berg added. ’

Not only is a goalkeeper men-
tally tired after the game; he is
also physically drained.
Although most ofthe action is in
the field of play. the goal area can
get pretty busy--and rough.

Getting clobbered by charging
opponents. smacking the hard
ground after making diving

V catches and suffering bruises and

brushburns are all part ofa day‘s
work for Thunberg.

“You have to have, something
wrong with you to be a keeper."
Thunberg said. laughing. “I like
to play positions where you get
hurt. Why’ else would I be
keeper?"

Thunberg relies on his sarcas-
tic humor to deal with all the
physical punishment.» \

“My humor is a coping mecha-
nism." said Thunberg. “Its the
best wayil know to get through
something that’s giving me a

Akron Test
For Pitt

The Pitt soccer team will face its
toughest test of the season tonight
when the o—| Panthers host the l3th
ranked University of Akron.

The Panthers lost to Akron last
year 4-1 on the road. but the Pitt
booters didn't fall easily. Pitt played
Akron to a 0-0 draw at the end ofthe
first half last year.

“Akron will be the best team we‘ve /

faced so far." said Pitt Coach Leo

Bemis. “They have excellent talent.”  T

Akron is 6-3 on the year. but the
teams they‘ve lost to are some of the
best in the nation. Nationally-
ranked Penn State ripped Akron 2-l
and No. l Indiana (at Bloomington)
dro_p_ped—them 3-I.

The Akron team is heavily loaded
with talent from all over the world.

The bulk‘ of Akr0n's scoring
comes from Matt English, a bigjun-
ior striker who is a bonafide All-
America.

On the wing position. Akron has a
lot. of quickness in African J.B.
Amangoua. a 26-year-old from the

Ivory Coast. and Joe Pereira. a  
native of Portugal who playedaf‘

soccer in Canada. was a I979 All-
America.

‘With all of this speed. Bemis has .

made some defensive changes. The
Panthers will use two men on the
front line instead ofthree and put

the extra back in the midfield to A

strengthen the defense.

Bemis has moved Karl Heimbach
into the middle and freshman Jeff
Dunn will get his first start at right
fullback. Bemis made the move
because Dunn has good speed to
hopefully handle the explosive
Akron scorers. '

“l’ve made these adjustments to

make our defense stronger,” saidv ﬂ

Bemis. “I just hope it ‘won’t take
away from our scoring attack."

The.Panther scoring attack will be
hurting ifiinjured leading scorer Eric
Tiedtke. still a big question mark,
cannot play tonight. Tiedtke injured
his ankle in the Bethany loss last
Wednesday and has not been ableto
practice since. lt will be determined
today if Tiedtke plays. '

Bemis says he will rely onhis stel-

lar defense to keep the team in'i
‘ tonight‘s game. '

“Thelmain thing we’ll haveto do is
keep the score down." said Bemis.
“We’re going to have to play the fin-

est defensive game we've ever
played. If we can keep the scoreﬁgi.

down. we'll have to chance to score

and hopefully win.“

Game time is 7:l5 p.m. All stu-
dents with a Pitt l.D. are admitted
fF€€* 3 bargé}in.. considering the
caliber of both teams. V

“We respect the Akron team.”
said Bemis. “but we’re goingto show

‘,up and defnitely ive them tame.”

By JOHNETTE‘ HOWARD

The cornerstone forthe formation
of an all-sports Eastern conference
may be placed tomorrow when
athletic directors from seven
schools. including Pitt. meet in Phi-
ladelphiatodrafttheleague‘s consti-
tution. bylaws and regulations.

The written results oftomorrow’s
meeting. which will also include dis-
cussions of a revenue sharing plan.
academic standards. league officials
and league office operations. will be
sent to each school’s chief ofﬁcals
for examination. according toiPitt
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski.
Further action ‘on the conference
will be put on hold. pending any
revisions of tomorrow’s results.

The movement to form the con-
ference gained impetus after Fiesta
Bowl officials suggested a possible
tie-in with the league—which ‘would

tentatively include Pitt. Penn State.- _

Boston College. Syracuse. Rutgers.
Temple. West Virginia. and perhaps
Army or a darkhorse candidate like
Virginia Tech or Maryland.’

The Fiesta Bowl officials have had
“extremely serious" discussions with
members ofgthe proposed confer-
ence about accepting its football

champion. according to Myslinske.
and the conference members are
extremely interested.

The Fiesta Bowl: which is played
on New Year‘s Day in Tempe. Ariz..
may be able to guarantee its teams
up to $l.5 million each this year.

“There’s no question the Fiesta
Bowl is
changed the game date to Jan. l
(from late December). and (they
want someone tojoin up with them.”
Myslinski said. “They realize the
East can be a very lucrative area.
with the number of TV sets here.”

Further complicating the Eastern
conference picture for Pitt are the
recent overtures Pitt has received
from the Big East basketball confer-

ence and its commis-sioner. Dave
Gavitts. who has met with Mys-
linski iwice in.the last four months
and hinted at a membership offer for
Pitt. .,

Unlike the Eastern 8 basketball
conference. which Pitt is currently
committed to for at least the 1981-82
season, the 2-year-old Big East
offers a lucrative television contract
to its members and outlets in four of
the nation’s top-eight..TV markets.

According to Myslinski. who last
met Gavitts on Sept. 29. the Big East

growing up—— \they‘ve.

Around the Corner?

discussions have been very general
and Pitt has not received a “formal
invitaiton“ to its eight-member fold.
But. Myslinski added. Gavitts did
hint that Pitt was welcome in the
league and that an opening did exist
if Pitt wished to apply.

Gavitts acknowledged yesterday
that he has had “very general discus-
sions with some athletic officials at
the University of Pittsburgh. but
they’ve been exploratory discussions
so far." W

I Gavitts said Pitt would be an
attractive addition to the Big East
because of its national reputation in
football. strong basketball tradition
under Coach Buzz Ridl in the l970s.
the recent resurgence of the basket-
ball program under Coach Roy
Chipman. and...oh yeah. Pitt’s loca-

I‘ tion in the nation’s l Ith largest tele-

vision market.

“From that standpoint. they
would be a very attractive addition.”
Gavitts said. “The conversations
haven‘t come to the pointof any
offers on our part or Pittsburgh app-
lying. They've been very general.”

With the possibility _ofthe Eastern
conferences formation growing
stronger. Gavitts acknowledged that

it may have been Dave Parker‘s

baseball season and he saved it for
last.

“Goodbye. Pittsburgh: Stein-
brenner‘s already got me a condo in
upstate New York,” Parker yelled to
no one in particular in the clubhouse
of the Pittsburgh Pirates after
Sunday‘s 4-0 loss to ‘the St. Louis
Cardinals.

Most of\ his teammates were
quietly packing their bags. some
were watching the Steeler game on

Qtelevision and they didn‘t look up as
Parker’s voice boomed.‘

That’s because he often shouts
that way after games, and he has
traded himself many times during
his high—decibel ramblings.

But his suggestion that he might
be traded to George Steinbrenner’s

more than just loud talk.

said.

Daniels. clipboard or no clip-

offense. His role is vital and the
coaching staff makes sure to drill
him constantly in case the worst

happens
The worst might have happened.
I)an Marin’s injury is serious

enough to have him listed as ques-
tionable for Saturday’s game. When
discussing injuries. players usually
react ‘with optmism over their
return. Yesterday. that wasn’t the
case with Marino. »

-“If the game was tomorrow,
(Wednesday)“ I couldn’t play."
Marino dejectly reported.

The stiff shoulder limits the
throwing motion ofthe man that has
made the Pitt attack one of the most
explosive in the country. Most peo-
ple seem to feel that Dan Marino
will play on Saturday. Maybe it's

S just wishful thinking on their part.

in the end, perhaps Marino will be
taking the first snap from center on
Saturday; but if he doesn’t. Dan
Daniels will be thrown into the big-
gest game of his football career.

The Superman role is out there
waiting.

these two teams get together, it’s
such an emotional battle." Sherrill
said.

Nehlen seems to be approaching
the Pitt-WVU rivalry with a similar
outlook.

“We’ll show up. they’ll show up
and we’ll have a lot of people in the
stands yelling like crazy. I think it
might come down to who wants it
bad enough,“ Nehlen said. “I ddrrr
know what will make the difference
Saturday.”

Nehlen hopes it won’t be a quote.

the Big East is concerned with the
likelihood that two of its members.

and Syracuse. would go with the
new league. By luring Pitt into the
Big East fold. the new Eastern con-
ference is generally given a slim

“We would prefer not to lose Bos-
‘tone College and Syracuse.

Gavitis admitted. While Boston
‘ College and Syracuse have balked at
transferring their basketball pro-
grams out of the Big East. it‘s likely
they would‘ rather do so than stay
out of a new all-sport East league‘.

Despite the financial advantages

cated Pitt prefers joining an all-

" sports East conference instead of

just a basketball conference.

‘flf we go with the conference, we
would be leaning toward the bowl

  ‘tie-in and still have the possibility of

our own .very‘ fine basketball confe-

 rence." Myslinski said. “This isn’t a.
” proven fact’. but the East conference

 

   

“Could produce a good (basketball)

He played in 67 ofthe Pitt'sburgh‘s

He was in the lineup before Satur-

day's game with St. Louis. a game

that could have counted in the play-,

off race. ‘But he was removed before
the game with what a team spokes-

-— man said was a “cold." Parker didn't
 play Sunday either.

“l can't comment directly about
Dave Parker.” said Pirate Executive
Vice President Pete Peterson. who

» witnessed some of Pai:ker’s ranting

“But my general comment is that

il’ll trade anybody except Willie’

Stargell if the deal will help the
Pirates." Peterson added. \
"That doesn’t mean l‘m going to

l‘i_n not goingto trade him."

are planning to meet with NBC-TV‘s
Jeff Mason in about two weeks to
get a comparison of the money
involved in televising the Big East‘s
regular-season games or basketball
games for the East conference.

That noise in the background may

 

be the Eastern 8 crumbling. Pitt.
West Virginia and Rutgers have
promised to inform the Eastern 8 of
their intentions to stay or leave by
Oct. l5. and Freeman. Pitt‘s top
decision-maker on athletic matters.
has gone on record saying the future
of the Eastern 8 is very much in

     

doubt. Billicki echoed Frceman‘s
sentiments. saying. “Unless some-
thing happens. the Eastern 8 doesn’t
look like a viable alternative right
now."’ P

But Myslinski probably best
summed up what it would take to

improve the Eastern 8‘s chances of

K

survi\al against the East conference 

best when said. "There
miracles.”

It will be a miracle. if the Eastern
conference loses out. If all goes well.
Myslinski thinks play could begin in
two to three years. depending on
scheduling difficulties. i
