Fighting cancer with shear will

Pitt student group Buzzing4Change raised money and collected donated hair for charities yesterday

Olivia Garber
Staff Writer

Krystle Heffner sat demurely in
the chair, occasionally taming her
wind—tousled hair. The Pitt sopho-
more’s medium brown crop swung
just below the chin.

The 10 inches she’d just had

chopped off sat sealed in a gallon-
sized Ziploc bag a few feet away.

“Ihaven’t seen a mirror yet,
but I think I’ll be okay,” Heffner
said.

Heffner was one of about 10
women to donate hair during the
charity Buzzing4Change’s fund
raiser for Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh Foundation. The event

was held yesterday on the William
Pitt Union lawn to raise funds and
awareness for pediatric cancer.
Amanda Russell, president of
Pitt’s chapter of Buzzing4Change,
began planning for the event in
2009. Her friend Judah Ferst got
the idea to form Buzzing4Change
in 2002 while he was a student at
George Washington University.

Ferst, who graduated in 2005,
wanted to increase support for
cancer patients, as well as honor
his mother’s memory —— she died
when he was 15.

Buzzing4Change currently has
chapters in Virginia, Pennsylvania
and Washington, D.C., but Ferst
hopes to spread the organization
to colleges nationwide._

Williams
gears up
for draft

Tony Jovenitti
Sports Editor

ditor’s note: This is the
second part in The Pitt
News’ series ofproﬁles

‘on the eight Panthers who are

entering the NFL Draft, which
takes place next weekend in New
York.

Pitt senior Mick Williams is
6’1” tall and weighs 285 pounds.
But that’s not big enough.

Williams h_as been a standout
defensive tacklegfor the Panthers
for the past few seasons, and he
will be eligible for next week’s
NFL Draft.

According to his agent, his

defensive skills are exceptional,
and his determination certainly ‘

isn’t lacking. ,
, The one thing that is lacking,
however, is height. "That will be
the one thing to blame if he isn’t
drafted next weekend.

“I didn’t know I was getting

drafted for the NBA,” Williams

said. “I didn’t know that height
mattered that much in football,
especially when you’re defensive
player of the year.”

Williams was named the Big

_ East Co—Defensive Player of the

Year, an honor he shared with
teammate Greg Romeus, a junior
defensive end. i

As much as Williams would

like to be drafted, he knows he W

A tide of purple-shirted, yellow-
sign—waving protesters descended
on Market Central yesterday after-
noon. »

Protesters from the Service Em— C

ployees International Union joined

. a protest by Pitt student group Stu-

dents in Solidarity with Service Work-
ers. .

After a brief but loud protest in-
side the cafeteria, police asked the
protesters to leave. The group soon
dispersed after leaving Towers.

“Everyonerdispersed as soon as
the police asked,” said Pitt junior
Shannon Sweeney, a member of the
group.

Matt Painter, a spokesman for
the Service Employees International
Union, a union Sodexo employees
can join for representation, said the
group was protesting against So-
dexo’s treatment of its non—unionized
workers on Pitt's campus.’Sodexo
runs Pitt's dining services at all of

l

its campuses.
He said that about 150 of _So—

dexo’s employees at Pitt were not in .

unions and received worse pay and
beneﬁts than unionized workers.~The

4non—union workers were the focus

of the protest and SElU’s action,
he said.

Students in Solidarity with Ser-
vice Workers focuses on “pressuring
the University” to help provide better
work .environments for its employees,
Sweeney said. Although the Sodexo
employees are not part of the Univer-
sity staff, she said Pitt could dictate
the terms of its contract with Sodexo,
providing for better pay and work
benefits.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele did
not have a comment, stating that
the protest was an issue between
the unionand Sodexo.

The local SEIU chapter filed a
complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board on March 24, al-
leging that Sodexo employees were
coerced and interrogated, according
to the National Labor Relations Board
website.

New textbook law to
take effect before fall

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Lawmakers in Washington and Harrisburg
hope to make buying textbooks easier, cheap-
er and more competitive.

A federal law that will place some require-
ments on universities and publishers to push
for competitive textbook sales will go into
effectjuly 1. And on campus yesterday, a pair
of state House committees held a hearing
about making a similar, more stringent law
for Pennsylvania.

The State House Committee on Education
and Committee on Consumer Affairs took
testimonies on a state textbooks bill at a
morning hearing in the William Pitt Union.
The committees heard testimony from sev-
eral people, including a representative from
Barnes & Noble Bookstores, an independent
bookstore owner and a representative from
a publishing ﬁrm.

Paul Supowitz, director of Pitt’s Govern-
mental Relations, said that Pitt occasionally
provides spaces for hearings like that one,
but the University does not necessarily sup-
port them.

State Rep.]oseph Preston]r., D—Allegheny
County, introduced the bill and co-chaired
the hearing. He said that meeting at Pitt was a
matter of convenience, and that he thought it
was appropriate to discuss the bill in a higher
education community.

The 9:30 a.m. meeting did not see a large
turnout, Supowitz said.

“If there were students there,” Supowitz
said. “There weren’t many.”

The federal law — the Higher Education
Opportunity Act, which passed in 2008 —
has a number of similarities to the proposed
state bill.

Both bills try to open up the process of A

selling textbooks. Under the federal law, all
colleges would be required to disclose the
class size and required textbooks for each
class at their universities to any bookstore
that requests it.

That, Preston said, will give bookstores

outside of the university system a chance
at fair competition, because they can know
what textbooks classes require before the
term begins. “What is wrong with that in-
formation being public?” Preston said. “It’s
public knowledge when the class begins
anyway.” i

The state bill might take the process a step
further than the federal one, Preston said.
The bill is still in committee, and Preston
doesn’t know when that might change.

“We can make some stronger competition
in the state,” Preston said.

The state bill, the Accountability in Col-
lege Textbook Publishing Practices Act, was
referred to the education committee last year.
Preston said that by holding the hearing, the
committees hoped to ﬁnd out more about
the situation with college textbook sales in
Pennsylvania.

He said some of what he heard surprised
him.

“Right now, books might be reprinted
with 20 or 200 words changed,” Preston said.
“That costs millions of dollars.”

The state bill would require publishers
to disclose substantial changes they make in
each edition of a textbook, and require ‘the
publishers to give 45 days notice of a change
in the price of their textbooks.

Opinions

EDITORIAL

Lose anonymity,
lose candidness

elling at the television is so
i last century. You might still
shake yourﬁst or utter some
harsh words when that politician
you love to hate pops up on the tube,
but today there’s another option.
Find your favorite political blog or
a recent news article featuring said
politician, and let your caustic com-
ments run loose. Don’t worry. It’s
anonymous.

The ability to comment on online
videos, articles and photographs is
as ubiquitous in the digital world
as commercials are on TV. Ideally,
commenting provides a practical
forum for feedback from anyone
who happens to come across your
tricycle tricks video or online journal
entry. But those anonymous com-
ments can get rather scathing, and in
some instances, commenting anony-
mously has led to legal problems and
lawsuits.

Now, some news sites are chang-
ingtheir commenting policies. They
and other papers are getting rid of
the option to comment anonymously
and are instead requiring that people
register and give some information
about themselves before they’re al-
lowed to comment, The New York
Times reports. Comments on any
site about an article or video can be
insightﬁil and beneﬁcial, but more
often they’re needlessly scathing and
requiring a commenter’s identiﬁca-
tion could help control the chaos
stemming from online comments.
Still, nixing anonymity might pre-
vent viewers from sharing honest
thoughts. Those thoughts, however,
could still be presented in a way that’s
candid yet not so characteristically
cruel and crude.

News sites opposing anonymous
comments are concerned about
more than just swaths of vulgar lan-
guage and obnoxious comments —
although those are hardly attractive
on any professional site. Comments
can get quite controversial and raise
legal concerns. The Plain Dealer, a
Cleveland newspaper, recently traced
anonymous comments about a local
lawyer to a judge who was overseeing
some of his cases. The judge denied
leaving the comments on the paper’s
website and is suing The Plain Dealer
for violating her privacy, The New
York Times reports. Additionally,
two Yale students settled a lawsuit
last year against people who anony-
mously posted deprecatory com-
ments about them on a website for
graduate students, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education.

By requiring a username and
some background info, sites can
more easily control comments and
delete users who leave inappropri-
ate or otherwise improper com-
ments. Some sites have personnel
constantly scanning or prescreen—
ing comments to deter bigoted or
objectionable comments. That’s one
solution, but it requires signiﬁcant
manpower and time.

News sites have more to be con-
cerned about than the range of zany
YouTube videos that receive com-
ment after comment of degrading

feedback. But the problem isn’t a

limited to news sites, and neither
is the solution — that is, reducing
anonymity. As much as this effort
might tone down some of the nasti-
ness anonymous commenting lends
itself to, there’s more at stake than
hurt feelings.

Driving ourselves insane

Who ever said. driving was relaxing?

 
   

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

Two weeks ago, I was driving on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike, and I saw
a sign that said “Breezewood.” I al-
ways stop at the Breezewood service
plaza, so I pulled over. Going down
the exit ramp, I felt a knot in my
stomach as I realized I had pulled off
at the Breezewood exit. Instead of a
friendly fast-food oasis, it was a toll
plazathat loomed before me. I checked
my card. The charge was $4.10, but I
only had $2.50, since I had planned
to get my toll fare from the AIM at

Breezewood.

Itold the man at the tollbooth, “I’m
fromAlaban1a. I’ve neverbeen onthe
uimpike before. I heard there would
be agas station center at Breezewood,
andlwas gonna get some moneythere,
but right now I don’t have any.”

The best thing about being from
Alabama is that no one ever thinks,
“That guy should have known better.”
No one ever expects people from Ala-
bama to know anything.

The man in the tollbooth nodded
glumly and ordered me to back up,

tumaround and getbackonthe road, .

which I would have done in the ﬁrst
place if I’d known itwas legal. The car

behind me had to back up, too, and an

old lady glared at me from her shiny
blue Buick.

Driving is depressing.

The main way drivingbrings on de-
pression is by making me feel stupid.
I’m not selflloathing: I only feel stupid
wheneverl mess up something really

obvious — tasks that a competent ,

adult should be able to do right 999
outoflooo times. But drivinggives me
so manythousands of chances to make
one—in-a-thousand blunders thatlfail

phe several times per year.

In contrast, I don’t pride myself

Every time we look in the mir-
ror, walk past a dusty photo or try
to fit into an old pair of jeans, we
are reminded that —— no matter
how much we protest — time is
constantly passing.

those eccentric characters we’ve
encountered.

That’s the theme at the center
of Alan Ayckbourn’s play “Time
of My Life,” which the Pitts-
burgh Public Theater will pres-
ent tonight through May 16. The
show is a snapshot in the lives
of a multi—generational family
celebrating the birthday of its
matriarch, Laura. Joined by her
husband, Gerry, their son Glyn,
daughter-in-law Stephanie, sec-
ond son Adam and his girlfriend,
Maureen, she enjoys a celebra-
tory meal at the swanky eatery
Essa de Calvi.

[The characters] all grow to
appreciate their existences
as they were, are and will

be.

Along the journey, we have the
responsibility to decide which
moments were the best, which
were the worst and to remember

Using the playwright’s pen like
a magic wand, Ayckbourn takes
two of his characters at a time to
past, present and future points in

their lives. The experiences prove

ANALYSIS

People can learn something about music from listening to these unfortunate remakes.

Lindsay Carroll
Contributing Editor

Covers are a hot topic of debate in
the music world. Some people love
them. Other people think they’re a
blasphemy to original source mate-
rial. Some covers generally succeed
—— think those of Leonard Cohen
or Bob Dylan songs — because the
originals, though memorable and
important, sound kind of bad al-
ready. And other artists, like Jeff
Buckley, have completely mastered
the art of the cover.
Others, however, have not.

My journey into looking for bad
covers began as I crawled music
blogs for new music. I found a bad-
cover gem in Mary Chapin Carpen-
ter’s version of Bruce Springsteen’s
“Dancing in the Dark.” What was
an ’8os anthem became a painﬁilly
slow folk ballad.

And then I realized that bad
covers are an under-appreciated
genre. I began searching for the
10 worst covers of all time. This
is by no means a comprehensive
list — I left out songs that I had
never previously heard, songs by
random tribute bands, songs from

American Idol and songs that were
supposed to be funny (i.e. Alanis
Morisette’s “My Humps”). But
from these bad covers, we can
learn something important about
music — that a basic part of mak-
ing a good song is having a deep,
personal connection to the words,
instrumentation and the overall
message of the song.

Without those requisite ele-
ments, covers can fail miserably.

lo. “Stairway to Heaven” —
Dolly Parton (original: Led
Zeppelin)

I’ll preface by saying that I apol-
ogize for including a Dolly Parton
song on this list. Yes, I agree with
you that Dolly Parton is awesome.
However, as overplayed as Led
Zeppelin’s version was, hearing
Dolly Parton sing it is kind of hi-
larious. The song, released on the
album “Halo & Horns” in 2002,
is overly breathy, melodramatic
and contains way too much voice
inﬂection.

The harmony parts are awk-
ward, but the instrumental parts
with the guitar and violin, are

"1152 under-appreciated genre of bad covers

beautiful —— and I am impressed
with how Dolly Parton croons “O0,
it makes me wonder.”

This song, admittedly, isn’t as
bad as it could have been. But it
gets much worse from here.

9. “Walk This Way” — Macy
Gray (original: Aerosmith)

I put Macy Gray at No. 9 be-

cause I support her for trying. I still _

think this cover is bad, but doing a

pseudo-funk version of this song is

at least somewhat interesting.

Celine Dion does AC/DC

What made the diva think her “Titanic” hittwas a; ﬁtting
prerequisite to cover rock legends?

Covers 4 8

song, is another ‘example of a good idea with

questionable execution. It features a steady
bass line, cowbell and a horn part that are
predicatble and lacking in the improvisation
that I would expect from a funk song.

I’ve heard plenty of people say how much
they hate Macy Gray and her voice, but I’m
trying to avoid criticizing artists for the
qualities that make them who they are.

8. “American Pie?’ — Madonna
(original: Don McLean)

This song reached the top of the charts
when it was released in 2000, but I’m guess-

ing it was because of its novelty and not

because the song is good.

Madonna turns Don McLean’s original
ballad into awhimsical pop song, completely
subduing all of the political and cultural is-
sues that McLean had hoped to highlight.

I The music video tries (unsuccessfully). to

update those issues. Madonna’s vocals are
boring and unemotional, unlike McLean’s.’

7. “You Shook Me All Night Long” —
Celine Dion and Anastacia (original:
AC/ DC)

I didn’t know who Anastacia was before I
watched this video of the duo performing at
“Live Divas: Las Vegas” in 2002, but I have
never seen someone wear a more stereotypi-
cally early—2000s outﬁt than her.

Not only is the idea that this cover exists
hilarious, but the video is also hilarious, as
I’m sure you can imagine. I’m certainly not
saying that Celine Dion doesn’t have talent
— I don’t know who I would rather have
sing “My Heart Will Go On” or"5Because

 4 You Loved Me” ——but perhaps I’m not being

unreasonable when I say that covering AC/
DC is a stretch for her.

6. “Take My Breath Away” —Jessica
Simpson (original: Berlin)

Only Jessica Simpson could have made

_ this ’80s love song cheesier.

And only Nick Lachey andjessica Simp-
son performing the song live on Oprah —
on Oprah’s Valentine’s Day show, “Oprah’s

Most Romantic Man Search,” because it’s

the song they reportedly were listening to
when they kissed for the ﬁrst time — could
be any cheesier thanjessica Simpson’s solo
version. ' l ‘ .,

I suggest you listen to the Oprah version
—— which can be found on YouTube — for
the full effect. ‘ l '

So far, I have learned that overly emo-.

tional versions of songs generally go bad.
This is a tragedy, because I think Jessica
Simpson has an underrated (and perhaps,
under—utilized) voice overall.

5. “Folsom Prison Blues” —— Everlast
(original: johnny Cash)

Everlast makes blues music for Kid Rock
fans. But this song is a disaster. ,

The music video, complete with an Ever-
last-Johnny Cash montage, is also a disaster.
It also makes it seem like Everlast is playing
to sold—out crowds. *

I’m not completely averse to artists
sampling beats from rap songs with one of
the country’s most famous anthems —- in
principal. But Everlast, certainly, is not the
artist with the creativity to accomplish this
successfully.

Britney Spears tops
worst covers list

Nickelback cover still sounds like a Nickelback song

Covers 4 10

4. “Dancing in the Dark” — Mary
Chapin Carpenter (original: Bruce
Springsteen)

The song that inspired my research only
makes it to No. 4 on this list. When I ﬁrst
found it listed on the music blog “Star Maker
Machine,” I couldn’t stop laughing.

I love folk music, but I also love Bruce
Springsteen. This song makes me especially
sad, simply because it could have been done
so much better.

A friend told me that no female could
cover “Dancing in the Dark.” That’s not true.
Tegan 8: Sara did it, and their version was
successful because it was cute, creative and
fresh.

Mary Chapin Carpenter is a talented art-
ist who can perform both folk and coun-
try music, but when I listened to this I just
couldn’t stop laughing. Yes, Mary, Spring-
steen’s tempo of this might mask that it’s
actually a very sad song, but there’s no need
to make it wispy, overly emotionally affected
and exhaustingly slow. This song lasts for
more than six minutes.

3. “Dock of a Bay” — Michael Bolton
(original: Otis Redding)

I hate Michael Bolton for doing this. It’s
painful. I literally cringe when I hear him
attempt to sing with the level of emotion
that Otis Redding has in his songs.

This truly must be music’s worst night-
mare. And Michael Bolton attacked other
beautiful songs and penetrated them with
his shaggy cheesiness — for instance, he

also covered Percy Sledge’s “When a Man

Loves a Woman.” _

Worst of all, the idea of Michael Bolton
covering this seems completely ingenuine.
Making this song into a glamorous ’90s pow-
er ballad is incredibly sad, and my sentiment
is consummated by the music Video, which
features Michael Bolton singing in a foggy
shack of sorts with a shirtless wind instru-
ment player.

2. “Saturday Night’s Alright for
Fighting” — Nickelback (original:
Eltonjohn)

This is a cheap shot, because I knew any-
thing Nickelback covered would be horren-
dous. In fact, I didn’t even ﬁnd Nickelback
covers until I told my friend Erik about
my project and he suggested looking for
them. _

“Anything by them,” he said. “Any-
thing.”

And he’s right. This is the most egregious
example of their handful of covers (appar-
ently atone concert, the band also covered
0neRepublic’s “Stop and Stare,” which is
strange). Chad Krueger uses gravelly yelling,
as always. And then there is his triumphant
yelling of “Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!”
It’s horriﬁc. ,

The biggest problem I have with this song
is that somehow, Nickelback manages to

‘ make this song sound exactly like all of their

other songs (even that one with the Latin
rhythm).

So here’s to Nickelback, for completely
defeating the purpose of the cover. _

God, I can’t listen to this anymore.

Who allowed this to happen? I
remember owning Britney Spears’
“Oops, I Did'It Again” album when
I was a chubby preteen, but I don’t
remember this song. I doubt I
knew who the Rolling Stones were
back then. The song opens with*a
slow prelude of the song’schorus.

_ ears’ breathy, desperate voice
ruins the effect of the song.

It gets worse when the song
breaks into a ’90s dance beat, com-
plete with record scratches and
synthesizer sound effects. Plus, she
replaces some of the lyrics. Instead
of that man telling Mickjagger how
white his shirts could be while he’s
watching TV, we have “that girl”
telling Britney Spears how tigh
her skirt couldbe. - ’

‘Rocket

I think Britney Spears already
knows the answer to that ques-
tion.

rorized me when it was released in
2003. For years, I couldn’t listen to

NFL DRAFI' SERIES: PART 2 OF 8

Williams may
change position

Draft 4 1

his name is called next week-
end.

“It’s not about April for me.
It’s about September,” he said. “I
know people who got drafted in
the third round but got cut.”

“[Williams] doesn’t have the
ideal ‘measurables’ that you
would see in a defensive tackle
around the NFL,” Drew Smith,
Williams’ agent, said. “So he
hasn’t gotten the ‘love that some
of the other guys around the NFL
draft are getting.”

Mick Williams:

It’s not
about April
for me.

It’s about
September.

“That’s the thing that really
kills,” Williams said.

But according to Smith, Wil-
liams has everything else.

“He uses his leverage excep-
tionally well, he has a quick first
step and he uses his hands well,”
he said.

Williams was a captain this
year for the Panthers and had
42 tackles. Seventeen of them
were for losses, which put him
at second place in the Big East
and 23rd nationally. In the games

' against N.C. State and Navy, he

had a career-high eight tackles.
He also had ﬁve sacks and forced
three fumbles, one of which was
returned 50 yards by a teammate
for a touchdown.

The draft projections vary
for Williams. According to NFL-
DraftScout.com, the earliest

round he would be selected is the
sixth round, but there is a pos-
sibility he would not be drafted.
If that’s the case, he will likely
become a priority free agent.

Priority free agent is the
term used for undrafted players
who will likely be picked up and
signed by a team shortly after
the draft.

But defensive tackles are often
selected in the later rounds.

“[Steelers head coach] Mike
Tomlin is one of our clients,”
Smith said. “Tomlin said if an
NFL team is going to take a shot
on someone late in the draft, it
will be a defensive lineman. They
are a premium.”

“They can work with the team
for a long time,” Smith said.

Smith compared Williams to
one of his clients in the 2009 NFL
Draft, Kentucky’s Myron Pryor.
The New England Patriots se-
lected Pryor in the sixth round
as the 207th overall pick.

The Patriots also picked a
defensive tackle in the second
round. Boston College’s Ron
Brace was the 40th overall pick
in last year’s draft.

Brace played in nine games
and registered eight tackles. Pry-
or played 13 games and notched
20 tackles.

But Pryor was avoided in the
early round of the draft for the
same reasons Williams might
be.

“The knock on [Pryor’s] game
was that he didn’t have the size,”
Smith said.

He said Williams might not
even be playing as a defensive
tackle next year.

“His versatility could lead
him to becoming an offensive
fullback or a middle or outside
linebacker,” he said.

Williams has already been
working out with some NFL
teams as a fullback, including
the Green Bay Packers and the
Atlanta Falcons.

So even if Williams goes un-

Stat card for Mick Williams. Be sure to cut out and collect all eight of The Pitt News’ stat cards

drafted, there are still options.
There are even options if he
doesn’t make the cut for any NFL
teams.

“There’s a couple Canadian
teams that want me,” Williams
said. “But I’m not sure if I want
to go that route.” A

“It really don’t matter, I’m just
happy to be in this situation,”

he said.

But he hasn’t looked into do-
ing anything other than football
after leaving Pitt.

“I’ve been doing it since I was
six. It’s a part of life now,” he said.
“I enjoy playing the game. I just
get out there and make plays.”

And that’s why he is so deter-
mined to play the game profes-

~ vs.

sionally. If football doesn’t work
out, he’s not sure what he’ll do.
“I’m actually going to be three

credits shy [of graduating] as of

right now,” Williams, an adminis-
tration of justice major, said. {K

“If it just don’t work out, '1
have to maybe go to the Cana-
dian league,” he said. “Or look
for a job.”

AN OLTMANN’S OPINION

 

Holmes trade keeps Steelers ‘classy

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

On Sunday night, when I ﬁrst saw
the Steelers had traded Santonio
Holmes to the Jets for a ﬁfth-
round pick, I thought it was a big
mistake. Why would you ever trade
a former Super Bowl MVP for a
late-round pick?

But the trade seems to make
a lot of sense the more I think
about it. p

The Steelers have long been
known as a classy organization.
They’re run by the Rooneys, one
of the best ownership groups in
football. They have always held
their players to the highest stan-
dards. ,

But during the last few years,
other Steelers players such as Ben
Roethlisberger, James Harrison
andjeff Reed have all had off-the-
ﬁeld issues , and it was time that
the team took a stand against such
actions.

College Grad

REBATE

Holmes, who is doing his best
to follow in Ricky Williams’ foot-
steps, is suspended for the ﬁrst
four games of next season for
violating the league drug policy.
And he is one more failed drug
test away from being suspended
for a whole season.

Whether through his contro-
versial Twitter updates, getting
pulled over with marijuana in his
car or allegedly smashing a bottle
of alcohol over a woman’s head, he
was doing more harm than good
for the franchise —- a red ﬂag for
any general manager.

The Steelers said that they
were prepared to simply cut him
if they couldn’t ﬁnd a suitor, which
not only sent a message to Holmes
that it was time for him to go, but
made it clear to Roethlisberger
that one more of his highly pub-
licized slip-ups will not be toler-
ated.

Not only was unloading Hol-
mes good for the team’s image,
but if there’s any position the

The Steelers’ Santonio Holmes was traded to the New Yorkjets. This trade signiﬁes the Steelers’
ownership’s commitment to high standards.

and three more in the seventh. Although Pitt
couldn’t shut down Heath at the plate, it took
advantage of him behind it. The teamstole
four bases during the game.

Caravella left with the lead, but the
bullpen lost it in the seventh. _].R. Leonardi
gave up a two-run homerun to Penn State’s
Sean Deegan before handing the ball over
to Baker. Baker allowed the two runners he
inherited from Leonardi to score and also
sent Mario Eramo home when he hit Steve
Snyder with a pitch.

Jordano said that miscues on the mound
happen with a young staff.

“We are thin on the mound,”Jordano said.

“Three of the four pitchers throwing tonight
were freshmen. It’s a part of the learning
process, but we have to get better.”

Pitt’s chances to comeback from the 9-8
deﬁcit shrank when the Nittany Lions tacked
on another ﬁve runs in the eighth on two hits
and a costly error by shortstop Lopez. If not
for the error, the inning would have ended
with only one run on the board.

However, the Panthers bounced back
last night against Duquesne, winning 21-9.
Junior pitcher Kevin Dooley picked up the
Win for Pitt. The Panthers will travel to Phila-
delphia this weekend to take on Big East foe
Villanova in a three—game series.

Trade warning for
other Steelers

Holmes 4 15

Steelers could spare to lose someone, it’s
at receiver.

They already have one of the most con-
sistent receivers in the league with Hines
Ward, an emerging star in Mike Wallace
and just—signed veterans Antwaan Randle
El and Arnaz Battle to form what appears
to be a decent receiving corps, even without
Holmes.

This was the perfect time to get rid of
Holmes too, as he is entering the last season
of his ﬁve—year rookie contract and is sure to
command a high asking price in free agency
in the next offseason.

With pressing needs in other areas, such
as the offensive and defensive lines as well
as in the secondary, the Steelers might have
had to let him go after this year anyway, so
why not get a draft pick out of it now?

While Steelers fans should be thankful

for everything Holmes did for the franchise
(especially in the playoffs), they should trust
the judgment of the ownership team.

If you don’t think they know what they’re
doing, look no further than the last troubled
receiver that left the team to play in New
York.

Right now he’s known as inmate O9—R—
3260. But you probably know him better as
Plaxico Burress.

And what have teams who are known to
tolerate players with off-the—ﬁeld problems
like the Bengals and Cowboys won in the
past decade?

Absolutely nothing.

The Steelers are a proud franchise that

’ has won six Super Bowls — two in this past

decade — while running an organization
the right way, and it doesn’t look like that’s
going to stop anytime soon. "
