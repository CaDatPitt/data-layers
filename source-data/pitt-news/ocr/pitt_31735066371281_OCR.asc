Chemist  
calls for  
coal study

University of Pittsburgh -_ Pittsburgh, PA 15260;

By Michael Fay
The Pitt News

Coal-based synthetic fuel will not
play a prominent role in the future
unless the government of the United
States makes a genuine commitment
to its development, a United States
Department of Energy chemist said
yesterday. ,

Dr. Dennis Finseth, a graduate of
the University of Pittburgh, in his
lecture entitled “Coal F and Shale
Utilization: Past, Present and
Future” said both the research and
production of such synthetic fuel is a
very costly process. However, he
said, it is also very necessary.

“At some point, we will run out of

oil,” he said, but he added that coal A

and shale are abundant throughout
the world. ,
According to Finseth, the history

of coal-based fuel development has -

been very predictable. Those coun-
tries that have been willing to make
the financial sacrifices have pro-
duced results. Heused wartime Ger-
many and present day_South Africa
as examples of this. In both of these
cases, he said, the motivation has
been the desire or need to be self-
sufficient.

The problem with US. govern-
ment policy on coal research is that
it is directlycorrelated to the con-
stantly fluctuating price of a barrel
of oil. When the price of petroleum
drops, so does both government and,
corporate interest in coal, he said.

These attitudes may change,
according to Finseth. Prompted by
the unpredictability of major oil
producing nations" and the huge
costs of drilling exploratory wells,
the United States may reassess the
importance of self-sufficiency. A
$1 billion drilling project in the
Antarctic came up empty.

Coal, however, is very complex,
even to modern day chemists, he
said, and its structure is still debated.
Because it is not fully understood,
the method of producing fuel from it
is still primitive and very expensive.

It is a. simple process to extract oil
from shale, ‘but the problem is that
for every barrel of oil, one ton of
shale must be mined. This process,
he said, also leaves large amounts of
sulphuric sludge which must be dis-
posed of. This disposal makes up 40
to 50 percent of the cost of running a
plant efficiently.

“The only way to get around these
problems,” he said, “is for the U.S.
to follow the example of Germany
and South Africa and make a
genuine attempt to secure our future
energy needs.”

Lady Panther swimming and
diving teams as,they set out to
defend their title as Big East
Champions when they host the
conference‘s swimming and div-
ing championships, which start
tomorrow and continues

through Saturday.

“It’s difficult enough to win,”
said last year's. Big East Coach of
the Year, Dave Belowich, “but
it's even harder to defend a title.
Everyone wants to knock you

Belowich and the entire Pan

dine Burrel. “Everyone wanting
to beat usjust adds to our enthu-
siasm." The team is optimistic
that it will defend its champion-
ship. According to Belowich, if
the team does its best, the cham-
pionship will come on its own.
“Everyone is expecting to win,”
he said, “but they still know what
they have to do to win.”

He believes that last Satur-

day's meet with Princeton

proved that they are physically
ready because they were able to
perform well under such adverse
conditions.

“We were in the middle of a
taper when we swam against

Labor board

begins steps

to union vote

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

The Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board recently received the
petition for representation submit-
ted by Pitt’s United Faculty, accord-
ing to United Faculty president
Philip Wion, and responded by out-
lining the next steps toward unioni-
zation . r

The process of unionizing faculty
in the Provost‘s area began over two
years ago with an authorization card
drive that resulted in the collection
of 650 signed cards by Provost’s area
faculty members. These cards were
submitted last month to ‘the PLRB
with a sponsor petition requesting
that the board sponsor a repre-
sentation election in the near future.
The election would offer faculty
members the option of selecting

United Faculty as their bargaining .

agent or deciding not to have an
agent, according to Wion.
In a letter to the United Faculty

and Chancellor Wesley Posvar; the i if

board said that “the employer
should immediately furnish to the
board an alphabetized list of [Pro-
vost’s area] employees" who were
active on the university payroll sys-
tem just prior to the filing date ofthe
petition; - _

The purpose of this request,
according to ‘ university counsel
David Sullivan, is to provide the
board with the information neces-
sary to check the signatures and,
therefore, the validity ofthe authori-
zation cards.

The PLRB is also requesting that
the administration identify those
faculty members “who are supervi-
sory or who act in a confidential
capacity.”

While the identification of super- ‘

visory faculty may pose problems
for the administration, Sullivan said
every effort is being made to satisfy
the requirements of the labor board
as expeditiously as possible.

After the board has validated the
signatures on the authorization
cards, a pre-hearing conference will
be held, according to Wion. At this
conference, representatives of Uni-
ted Faculty and the administration
will meet with the board to define
areas of dispute.

“The chancellor doesn’t regard
the Provost's area as a legitimate
unit," Wion said. He added that he
anticipates this to be one of the
major issues of dispute at the
conference.

Such issues will be resolved by
labor board-sponsored hearings.
The hearings would be the final stop
prior to holding an election. \

This spring, students from secon-
dary schools and high schools all
over southwestern Pennsylvania
will either be quietly amassing huge
fortunes or losing their shirts on the
New York and American Stock
Exchanges. They will start with«
$l00,000 and over I0 weeks, graph,
chart, forecast and trade their way
to either fame or anonymity by
using a computer at the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. It is only a simula-
tion, but it is also serious business.

The numbers aren’t in yet for the
spring semester, but this past fall,
[05 schools and close to 5,000 stu-
dents played the game, introduced
two years ago by Pitt’s Center for
Economic Education.

The center’s director, Dr. Jeffrey
Blais, started the game in this area
with 650 students at l4 schools.
They had to mail ‘the computer
cards showing their transactions to
Virginia, where the software and
computer needed to play the game
were located. Now they use the
Post-Gazette computer and control
is a lot tighter over certain variables,
like mailing time.

The game is conducted in a class-
room setting and is open to anyone
past sixth grade. It‘s mostly used in
high schools and in “gifted” pro-
grams in juriior high schools,_typi-
cally as an adjunct to economics,
business, math or history classes.
For the students to get the informa-
tion needed to trade sensibly, a
Post-Gazette subscription comes
with the game. Also, brokers visit
schools, and students visit broker-
age houses or call them at any time.
The game is subsidized in part by the
Western Pennsylvania Securities
lndustry,Association.

It works as follows. Students
trade Monday through Friday every
week with 2,300 companies from
which to choose. They pay broker-
age fees, open marginal accounts

collateral for the loan necessary to
buy it), take out loans (as long as
they’re willing to pay interest) and
take short positions (sell stock they
don’t own but think will go down in
price, so they can buy it back and
make a profit having only borrowed
it in the first place).

Students can do anything a better
client could do at a brokerage house
—— but they only have 10 weeks.
Every Monday morning, the Post-
Gazette sends them a printout show-
ing them where they stand and how
they rank with other schools.

For their efforts, they learn what
stocks are, how they’re traded, the
things that make stocks go up and
down and how a corporation finan-

M ces itself.

Blais said, “We want them to real-
ize that while news events can cause
lots of short term change, it’s risky
to react to these things, and that
over the long term, stocks are a via-
ble thing to do with your savings.

“It gets them reading the paper
regularly too — many of them for
the first time." ' ,

Then, of course, there’s the first
prize — a trip to Wall Street for the
team and their teacher who’ve made
the most profit at the game's
conclusion.

The Stock Market Game was
adapted for use in the United States

from a Canadian original by Dr.

Williams Bennett at Buffalo State
University. According to Blais, Ben-
nett began eagerly sending the pro-
gram all over the U.S. in the late ’70s

‘ but made the tactical error of failing

to copyright it. There are now prob-
ably 50 versions of it in 20 states.

Blais heard about it from a gradu-I
ate school friend at an economics
convention. He contacted Bennett
and got a copy of the game sent to a
computer large enough to handle it
in Virginia.

Parker-Hunter Inc. of Pittsburgh
volunteered some time and man-
power to get it rolling. At a $6.80 fee
per four-man group, the game
doesn't turn a profit.

Pitt’s Center for Economic Edu-
cation offers its services, the Post-
Gazette gives free computer time,
and the brokers certainly don’t
make money, but Blais said he’d like
to see it break even soon.

He recounted one ‘story where a
tip-off paid off, just like in the real
world.

“One student had a pretty con-
ventional portfolio. It was OK,
nothing spectacular —— IBM,
AT&T. He said, ‘Something’s gotta
give here ifl want to win.’

“He worked part-time at Wickes

’ Furniture, out near the airport. One

Saturday, moving furniture in the
warehouse, he heard that Wickes
was going under -— that they’d lose
their jobs‘-— real soon; He was a
little upset about that, but on Mon-
day, he went in and told his team,
‘Look, we want to take a short posi-
tion at Wick's because that stock's
going to fall, so lets go to the compu-
ter and borrow as much as we can
right now and sell it. After the fall,
we can buy it back for practically
nothing, and the difference will be
pure profit.’ ’

“So they put in an order for some-
thing like 10,000 shares ‘short’ of
Wickes Furniture," Blais continued.
“The company declared bankruptcy
that week; the stock stopped trading
the price fell to zero. He ended up
with 200 and some odd thousand
dollars for his team. Someone could
have gone to a broker and donejust
that.”

The Stock Market Game is
offered through Pitt’s Informal Pro-
gram (PIP) as well. The cost is $50.
Blais will begin conducting the game
this week.

Labor Pains

Members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local
23 have picketed 45 area Kroger supermarkets since mid-
January. Yesterday, the Kroger Company announced it plans
to sell all 45 stores. The union, which recommended the strike,
and the struggling Pittsburgh economy are now left with more
than 2,800 unemployed workers. a

‘ In the past few years, unions have received harsh criticicm
from the public. Nearly every AFL-CIO president has been
brought up on charges for misconduct. Both unions’ being

. viewed as big businesses and their connections with organized
crime have caused them to lose a lot of their bargaining power.
The necessary components of unions are being eroded by hard
economic times and poor management of the unions.

The unacceptable conditions that led to the unionization of
America no longer are the norm. The big issue’ that occupies
unions today is maintaining and advancing of its members‘
quality of life. Unions have become just as intransigent as the
old robber barons who necessitated their existence. In the hard '
realities of today’s economy, the lack of cooperation by labor
and management has led to a decline in respect for unions.

A recently opened Mitsubishi auto plant inAmerica is unun-
ionized. Douglas Frazier, head of the AFL-CIO, has ‘sworn to
unionize the plant despite the fact that the workers have repeat-
edly rejected previous attempts. Last year, the number of
unionized workers fell to 25 percent, and for the first time in
more than six years, non-union workers’ salaries increased
more than those of their union counterparts.

These facts only parallel on a national level what is happ_en-
ing here in Pittsburgh; unions are losing their power and are
their own worst enemies. The need for unions is clear. When
times were good, the unions called for and deservedly received
the increases in benefits they sought. But now that times are
hard, they have to be willing to yield a little as well. I

Unions and management must dispel their adversarial rela-
tionships if genuinely productive labor agreements are going to

I be made. Labor and management should take a lesson from
what is still business’ greatest success story‘ and follow
ChrysIer’s lead in cooperative management.

Letters to the Editor

Socialized med.
social ill

Adam Eisenstat’s “A Call for
Socialized Medicine" (The Pitt
News, Feb. 13) is an excellent expose
of the hypocrisy of altruism. Mr.
Eisenstat cares about the poor and

‘ the sick (or so he says), so he thinks

the government should pay their
medical bills. The government, how-
ever, would raise the money to do so
by taxing those who are healthy and
working; Mr. Eisenstat apparently
believes that the government has the
right to coerce individuals into pay-
ing for services which they will not
use. In other words, society owes
some. people a living.

If Mr. Eisenstat were to have his
way, taxes would go up, decreasing
the supply of money available for
creatingjobs through purchases and
investments. (Perhaps Mr. Eisenstat
doesn’t care about the unemployed.)
Furthermore, Mr. Eisenstat forgets
the law of supply and demand; make
more money available for medical
care, and its cost will rise even more.
Mr. Eisenstat and his fellow do-
gooders, however, will have two
solutions: either raise taxes (creating
even more unemployment) or print
more money (and bring back high
inflation). i

Mr. Eisenstat doesn't say whether
he gave any of his own money to
help the child he mentioned in his
essay. I guess he wants us to pay the
kid’s bills with more economic woes

and a system that has never worked
for any other country that has tried
it.

Kevin Bold
GSLIS

A domestic

responsibily

I am glad to say that another edi-
torial by The Pitt News is not the
reason for my writing this letter to
the editor. The cause for which I
pick up my pen this time is one about
which I feel very strongly. This letter
is written in response to Michael
Ashford’s column in the Feb. I2
issue of The Pitt News entitled “An
American in Europe." I will lfirst
address several points of Ashford’s
repetitious and sophomoric article.

First, Ashford is correct in that ,

he cannot claim to be an authority
on the subject of “young Americans
abroad." I agree with him totally on
this point. Having visited almost 30
different countries over the last
seven years, I will claim to be much
more of an authority than Ashford.
If Americans were to travel under
the influence of Ashford’s ‘:hide
your flag between your legs" philos-

jophy, the already poor image of

America abroad would be further
tarnished. V

I am proud to be an American. I
always haveand probably always
will. The fact that Ashford can be an
American citizen and have the same
rights as I do is one of the reasons
that I am proud of my citizenship.

Nationalism does not mean a
reactionary movement “opposed to
criticism and change and which
advocates a reversion to an
exhausted sense of righteousness"
and morality.” Nationalism to me
means a loyalty and devotion to my
nation.

Ashford's definition ofwhat it

means to be “young” and “Ameri-i

can" is one that distresses me. “It
means a sad recognition of our his-
torical and contemporary role in the

,suffering of the people in distant

lands....” is a definition lthink that
is found in the dictionary of Com-
munist anti-American propaganda.

As a traveller going abroad, be
proud to be an American. Do not be
so proud that you are blind to the
facts that you are a guest in another
country whose customs and practi-
ces you must follow and that you can
learn from that culture.

Every culture has good and bad to
offer, so while abroad, examine both

and bring back those ideas with you. ,

It is in this way that you will expe-
rience personal growth, and perhaps
that. growth will have some good
effect on our culture. If you go
abroad and feel ashamed of our
nation and of the pre-conceived
notions that others have of Ameri-
cans, it is not going to benefit you. If
you are abroad and have the oppor-
tunity to live and work with the peo-
ple of other nations, I strongly
recommend doing so.

Liquor companies avoid underage

Paradoxical, that's just about the
best way I can put it. Teenagers, and
nowadays even adolescents, struggle
through life‘s early years, trying to
best deal with the pressures of
becoming an adult too early. Often-
times a true test of whether one
passes these “early entrance exams”
into adulthood revolves around a
can of beer or a vodka and tonic. .

The legality of drinking is not a r

questionable issue, the boundaries
being distinct. Depending on your
state of residence, you have only to
wait until the age of either I9 or 2| is
attained. Drinking beforehand is
outlawed. Drinking afterward is
not. Nothing moral about it. Legal
questions do arise, but for only 20
years —— a person's first, blessed 20
years.

It is at this stage of the game that
either sex will pull out all ofthe stops
and all of the fake IDs they can to
obtain a six-pack or a fifth of Jack

Daniels. They may beg their friend’s
brother‘s next-door neighbor’s dis-
tant fifth cousin to go to the state
store or coerce mom and dad into

buying a keg and some cocktail mix-

ers for that Sweet I6 bash that’s been
so long awaited.

Anything and everything has been
tried. The urge to demonstrate
adulthood is immeasurable. Peer
tactics may have something to do
with it, but it is really the ineffective
feelings many young people harbor.
Drinking 80- or I00-proof booze
gives them a sense of importance
and power.

Suddenly it all fizzles. Fizzles fas-
ter than the club soda poured over
vodka and rocks. Havingjust turned
21, I ought to know. Then the
paradox cast a pal] over me. For 20
years, I often cursed the slow pace at
which the months crawled by until I
could walk into a liquor store, deli or
beer distributor without feeling like

Dorothy standing before the Great
Oz.

The intimidation came from
knowing that I was breaking the law
by drinking while underage. It was
not, I have to emphasize, from the
$22 billion a year commercial adver-
tising industry, supported in part by
the beer companies. I consumed that
and the wine and the hard liquor for
other reasons. Others will say that
the booze middlemen of Madison
Avenue direct their ads at the
younger generation. of which I still
consider myself a part.

Then, to further this ill-grounded
logic. organizations such as Mothers
Against Drunk Drivers (MADD)
and Remove Intoxicated Drivers
(RID) will say that this has to do
with the 26,000 alcohol-related traf-
fic fatalities each year. It gets more
exciting. Seventy people die every

\day — one person every 23 minutes.

Don’t get me wrong. I support a
national drinking age of 21. There
must be mandatory license suspen-
sion and jail terms for those con-
victed of driving while intoxicated.
But do not lay all the blame for this
on the beer industry.

The beer industry might direct its
ads at the .college—age population,
but by and large, college students are
of legal drinking age. If you’re in
college, you're going to be offered a
drink. Lately, the industry is into
hooking this up-and-coming genera-
tion on its products.

Otherwise, I see such breweries as
Budweiser seeking out blue-collar
workers. Lowenbrau tries to attract
the fraternity crowd. The Pabst Blue
Ribbon man hangs out in bars.
Miller Lite is, in more ways than
one, for male athletes, and Meister
Brau honors those who rise from

drinkers

I

rags to riches.
MADD and RID are obviously in
the right business when both seek to

punish drunken drivers. But when

either interest group starts trying to
equate these beer ads with teenagers,
forget it. Even ifa sound case can be
made to this end, would teens be less
inclined to hone in on beer, liquor or
wine‘?

Beer ads played no part in my
decision to drink. It might have
greater impact on me now, since I’m
part of this up-and-coming genera-
tion. It’s a pity teens have to take the
rap when all they're doing is proving
to peers or others that adrinking age
is a strictly arbitrary decision and a
figment of the legislation's imagina-
tion. If only they could envision the
paradox of it all. Patience, I now
realize, is again only gained through
acquisition of wisdom. I like to think
I've acquired some over the years.

On the right course

Don‘t let me stop you. Wear your
ttons, hold rallies and scream
“drop Reagan" as loudly as you like.
lt’s nice to see that people still care
enough to stand up and shout about
something. But I'd like to say
respectfully that you're wasting your
breath.

You're vocal all right, but unfor-
tunately, you’re part of the vocal
minority.

President Reagan may be an actor
and older than the average- Ameri-
can, but like it or not; Reaganomics
has turned the economy around.
Things aren’t great in Steel Town,
but they are getting better. Don’t let
the buttons and the shouts of“I hate
Reagan, I hate Reagan” drown out
the whispers.

His votes won’t come from the
screamers; they’ll come from the
quiet people, the ones who are tired
of the revolving door installed at the
White House every four years.

Let’s keep Reagan in office and
see what a two-term president can
do. lt’s been a while since America
has given its leader a second chance.

lt’s my opinion and the opinion of
many others that America is finally
moving in the right direction. If a
strong dollar, lower interest rates
and increased consumer buying
power make you hate Reagan, then
vote for the Democrats. I’m sure
we’ll have inﬂation and serious eco-
nomic problems back in no time.

“What's that?“ you scream. “Rea-
gan's a war monger." Oh, come on.
You‘ve been saying that for four
years, and you‘re still wrong. We
went into Grenada, but we're out.
Sure Marines have died in Lebanon,
but they didn’t die because they were
at war. They died for the cause of
peace, not war. Now, to avoid
further trouble, Reagan's pulling the

With any luck, the draft will
remain a thing of the past. And I
think Ronald Reagans the man to
keep it that way. Your T—shirts and
buttons are really nice, but don't
think peace doesn‘t start at the top.
It does. Peace-keeping missiles are a
cruel paradox, but disarmament is a
project for the future, it seems.

We live in troubled times where,
for many people, the bottom line is
JUST getting by. Prosperity was a dis-

we have it at hand. Increased
employment and a balanced budget
are some of Reagan’s last hurdles. If
we let him attempt these last few

By Kathy Krause
The Pitt News

Although a heart transplant typi-
cally costs $70,000 to $80,000, rela-
tively few patients in Pennsylvania
are unable _to receive the potentially

life-saving operation, according to ~53

Dr. Henry Bahnson, chairman of
the department of surgery in, Pitt’s
School of Medicine. '

“Because Blue Cross and Blue
Shield cover heart transplants, this
is not much ofa problem in Pennsyl-
vania," Bahnson said yesterday in a
lecture at Scaife Hall entitled,
“Heart Transplantations: The Ethi-
cal Dimensions." Bahnson noted
that in some states many patients
cannot obtain the operation because
insurance companies will not cover
the cost of the operation.

consideration of society’s role in all
of this,” Bahnson said. People are
becoming increasingly interested in
the maintenance of lives through
heart transplants, both in Pittsburgh
and throughout American society,
despite the fact that an operation
may prolong a patient’s life for only
six more months. he said.

“Since organ transplants began,
the whole concept of brain death
had to be brought forward,” Bahn-
son said.

Bahnson cited recent develop-
ments in life-saving technology as
responsible for a changing definition
of brain death and re-evaluation of
ethics and priorities within the medi-
cal profession.

“One controversial case was that
of Karen Ann Quinlan and the idea
of keeping her alive as a liability and
cost to society and a cost and pun-
ishment to her family’s happiness,
with the known realization that she
would never have a functional exist-
ence,” Bahnson said.

Regarding the broad ethical prob-
lems posed by the new life-saving
technology, Bahnson concluded,
“Whether it is right or not, only time
-will tell.”

By Cheryl Sirko
The Pitt News

Many students in search of
summer employment overlook the
possibilities of working on a Finnish
campsite, a Norwegian farm or in a
West German resort. These arejust a
few of the job opportunities offered
through the International Studies
Abroad Program (ISAP).

The program enables students to
live and work almost anywhere in
the world. Three— to six-month
internships are available to students
in the program. Local contact with
the program can be made through
Pitt's study abroad office in Forbes
Quad.

“Students...who have work expe-
rience abroad have the advantage of
being exposed to other career possi-
bilities. They come back with other
interests to pursue,” said Angie
Yucas, director of Pitt’s Interna-
tional Studies Program.

Once abroad, a student has the
option of volunteer work or a paying

job, she said.

According to the “Whole World
Handbook — (I984-1985),” “...the
working hours for most jobs will be
long and wages a bit low by Ameri-

example, worked as hospital porter
in Great Britain and earned _the
equivalent of $130 per week.

Since there are many types of
jobs, a student can probably find
one that best suits his interest. Some
students try a different approach to
study and work abroad, called du
pair. Au pair\work requires the stu-
dent to spend several hours a week
teaching English to the family with
whom he lives.

Jobs such as these require a cer-
tain kind of individual, according to
Yucas, “A ’gutsy individual — some-
one who is willing to tackle the
unknown,” she said.

Pitt M.B.A. student Terry Eggart

was a computer science major here.

Eggart said the university helped
him find his job.

“Every day was an adventure!
You never knew who was going to
approach you,” Eggart said.

He also said he found almost no
prejudice toward Americans in Ger-
many. “The experience was great,”
he said, adding that he would recom-
mend it to anyone. Although know-
ing the Ianguage would make life a
little easier, it is not required,
according to Yucas,

Most countries recommend that a
student come over with $300 for

Budget cuts threaten future

Pitt helping comm

By G. Warren Mayers
The Pitt News

It is widely acknowledged that the
University of Pittsburgh has come to
extend its professional inﬂuence
well beyond the confines of its cam-
pus. Local, state and federal govern-
ment agencies all tap into the
university’s resources as the need
may arise. ‘

Pitt is also in the forefront of an
ongoing community relations effort
that reaches beyond the immediate

Oakland vicinity to the larger Pitts-

burgh community. .

Pitt’s Office of Urban and Com
munity Services (OUCS) located at
3814 Forbes Avenue adjacent to the
Office of External Studies, grew out
of the social and political unrest of
the mid-l960s.

Dr.

ing of the office in May, 1969.

“Following several protests on
campus, when black students had
taken over the computer center, Pitt
received a federal education grant to
establish an interface with the com-
munity,” said Bell.

In addition to the grant, the pro-
gram was to be funded through the
university’s operating budget. Bell
was tapped to head the new office
and to quell repeated calls by the
Black Action Society (BAS) that the
university install a provost for Afro-
American Affairs. BAS, according
to Bell, also requested that the posi-
tion be announced on the day of
spring graduation in 1969.

The university refused both
requests, Bell said, on the grounds
that “it may appear that the univer-
sity was running a segregated
school.” However, Bell's appoint-
ment to head the new OUCS was
reported in local newspapers the fol-
lowing day, he noted. -

However, according to Bell, the
BAS was not placated by this move,
and the protests continued. Three
weeks later the administration
responded by giving Bell the addi-

he was satisfied with. his appoint-
ment but not with the proposed
funding of the program. “I stipu-
lated that we receive no ‘soft’ money,
that is, grant money, but rather be
totally funded through the universi-
ty’s budget. One reason for this is
that programs funded through

I Lloyd H‘. Bell, executive A
director of OUCS, recalls the found-

dry up. Also, budget funding will
ensure the university’s responsibility
for the program."

Bell’s wish was granted, and the
federal education grant was severed
from the university funding. The
grant was then split between various
programs, -.including campus expan-
sion, news and publications and
governmental relations.

OUCS has weathered budget cuts
and other problems over the past
twelve years to emerge as a ﬂexible
muscle of Pitt’s community arm,
Bell said, explaining the office’s suc-
cess. “We not only serve the com-
munity, but help’ the faculty to relate
more effectively to the community.
For example, if faculty proposes a
program for the -community, we
introduce them to that community
andeven give money for implemen-
tation in some cases.”

In its first three years of opera-
tion, OUCS concentrated its focus
on Affirmative Action programs.
Outside of official channels, in fact,
it came to be known as a “black”
office, Bell explained. However, not
even he suspected how monumental
the growth of OUCS would become.

As a branch of Pitt's Office of
Public Affairs, OUCS has blos-
somed into a separate entity, still
attached to its sponsoring parent.
Within the unit, various branches
have sprung up to meet the needs of
the larger Pittsburgh community.
These are as follows:

0The Technical Assistance Unit.
Its main functions are conducting
community seminars on various
topics of public concern, organizing

  
 

, communities

unities

resources within the community and
assisting local communities in writ-
ing grant proposals. This unit is cur-
rently working with a Project Area

District to ensure that the residents
directly benefit from the proposed
reconstruction of that community.

0The Legal Unit. With Carl H.
Brown as its managing attorney-at-
law, this branch of OUCS provides
advice on business, corporate and
commercial transactions and offers
tax counseling and planning, includ-
ing advice on tax exemption issues.
This unit also acts as an arbiter for
several -contracts involving local
and Allegheny
County.

O,The Information Unit. Headed
by _former Pitt student Michael
McLendon, it offers a communica-
tion network within the community,
including the use of a computer
information service. According to
McLendon, who graduated as a
computer science major in the Class
of ‘SI, over 200 ties and community
organizations have used the resour-
ces of this unit. The Information
Unit conducts a Faculty Inventory
Skills Bank, which is responsible for
writingcommunity proposals and
for conducting seminars. Currently,
several communities use the compu-
ter network to compile mailing lists,
which can be easily revised and
updated.

Apart from these specific services,
OUCS and it departments offer a
host of other services. A few exam-
ples are programs in community
economic development,
services, resource
development and research and pol--
icy analysis.

In spite of budget cutbacks at
both the federal and state level,
OUCS continues to forge ahead. Dr.

Bell is optimistic about the future.

“The current operating budget
has been drastically reduced, but has
had minimal effect on the overall
operation,” Bell said. He did note
that one area that has been adversely
affected is the community seminars,

which have been drastically reduced.

Staff members have also been forced
to pay for their own travel, transpor-
tation and other expenses while con-
ducting business for OUCS.
However, according to Bell,
OUCS will go on serving the com-
munity as long as “both the com-
munity and university need us."

' I HERE IS A GROUP of Pitt students wholive _
and die by the philosophy of “no pain, no gain.”
It's not some kinky sex group, nor a bawdy,

long-haired rock band.

The students are bodybuilders and weightlif-

ters at Pitt.

“The whole thing is discipline," said student
Mike Markewinski, who pumps iron at Trees
Hall during the week. Discipline obsesses these -
muscle-minded students, looking to strengthen

their pectorals and abdominals.

“We can help someone tone, build or rehabili-
tate after an injury. We can make the girls look
good in their bathing suits,” says Rick McAteer,
assistant manager of Body Technics, a Nautilus

center on Forbes Avenue.
Getting in shape at Pitt can be difficult.
Students are less than 30 minutes from a

Domino's Pizza. The scent of Italian hoagies and
O-fries wafts from the corner of Bouquet and
Forbes Avenues. Even the Towers’ cafeteria,
with its all-you-can-eat format, looms as a threat

to getting into your Levi’s_ the next day.
Enter weight lifting and Nautilus.

“Any exercise program, as long as it's started
gradually, is fine,” said McAteer. Students make
up three fourths of the membership rolls at
Body Technics. The Forbes Avenue basement
offers 30 Nautilus machines, as well as whirl- -~
pools, stationary bicycles and aerobics classesi"

“Each machine is designed to isolate a spe- ‘ 
cific muscle,” he said. “lt's not like lifting weights
or pumping iron. Nautilus machines tone mus-
cles,” whether the goal is body-building competi-

tions or just bathing suits.

McAteer patrols the mirrored headquarters,

observing how the members use the
equipment. -

“Don't extend your arms all the way," he
advises one student, conditioning his biceps on

a specially-designed machine.

Janet Lavelle, a junior majoring in elementary
education, follows a Nautilus fitness program.

BY CATHERINE KIRSCHF

The drive to succeed often
compels athletes to employ
incredible rigors in pursuit of
their goals. Some competitors
make tremendous sacrifices
and endure physical and men-
tal torment to reach the top.

Some cheat. .

Every walk of life offers a path
of least resistance, fitness not
withstanding. Many athletes
resort to ingesting doses of ana-
bolic steroids to gain a competi-
tive edge.

Anabolic steroids are various
synthetic derivatives of the
male hormone testosterone,
explained Dr. Ralph Schmeltz.
endocrinologist at Magee
women’s Hospital. '

The controversy over steroids
centers on its effect on other-
wise healthy users. Users of the
drugs believe that steroids build
up muscle, increase strength,

 

restore energy after a workout
and enhance aggressiveness.
Many doctors, however, argue
that steroids probably do very
little, if anything, to give athletes
a competitive edge —- and may
even cause considerable harm.
Schmeltz cited a 1981 study
entitled “Anabolic Steroids Are
Fool’s Gold." The report stated
that the combination of weight
training and anabolic steroids

«does not necessarily increase

muscle mass or strength any
more than weight training alone
will.

Despite contrary evidence
presented by medical profes-
sionals, accomplished body-
builders maintain their belief in
the “polishing effect" of steroids.
noting personal gains in size
and strength. -

Schmeltz agreed that steroid
users will observe increases in
body weight. However, this is
attributed to the retention of salt

“This way, I go home and actually-study
better," she says. Her friend, junior Joanne
Sunico, also uses the facility as a diversion, “to
get away from things.” C

Scott Tapper is a medical student at Pitt. The
Nautilus circuit at Body Technics is ideal for his
purpose. He works to strengthen the specific
muscles heneeds to excel in rugby.

Students are offered an alternative method of
building or strengthening their muscles at Trees
Hall. Training supervisor Mark King said that the
weight room at Trees offers free weights‘ and

. weight machines.

“This is the only weight room for students for
recreation," says King. Students can also gain
supervised access to the equipment through
university physical education courses.

Pitt restricts usage of its Nautilus machines to
athletes, except in special cases, according to
King. But a large number’ of students use the ‘
free weights, following a specific program every
time they lift. 

“Most people have a program written up. One
day, they’ll work on building up their arms, and
then the next day, they’ll work on building up
their chests," King said. gt -

The individualized programs are vital to mus-
clar development. “lt gives the muscles a
chance to rest,” King said. ,

The Trees Hall facility is made up of two
rooms. The first room has full-length mirrors on
one wall, as well as stretching mats and‘
stationary bicycles. The other room has free _
weights and weight machines. .

The facilities get especially crowded, accord-
ing to King, from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays,
when many students and faculty members like
to work out.

women also make use of the weight room.
Their objectives a—re varied; some are interested
in bodybuilding or increasing muscle tone. in
addition to these health-related concerns, as one
woman said, the weight room was a “perfect
place to check out all the well-built men.”

iopefuls have already been
alled for defiance of the
"national Olympic Commit-
: ban on the drug. The Pan

American Sports Organization
disqualified 15 athletes at its
games in August with sophisti-
cated drug testing devices.

Pitt track star Roger Kingdom
competed in -the 1983 Pan
American Games in Caracas,
taking first place in the 110-
meter high hurdles. He is now
training for the 1984 Olympic
Games.

Kingdom remembers the uri-
nalysis test given to first- and
second-place finishers in Cara-
cas after their respective events.

The Pitt junior also remem-
bers a number of athletes con-
cerned with the drug testing.
some competitors feared their
steroid use would be discov-
ered and would result in expul-
sion from amateur competition,
including the Olympic Games.

Kingdom said that he was not
intimidated by the strict regula-
tions that govern amateur
athletics, claiming that his talent

was extracted from hours upon
hours of hard work. i

‘-‘What the IOC [International
Olympic Committee) is doing is
good,” he said. “Those who are
on steroids are trying to take the
easy way out. '

“If you cando it without it, why
use them?" he asked, tapping
his knuckles on hardwood for
emphasis. Kingdom’s success
in track and field seems to attest
that he can “do it without them.”

Steroids may have leaked
into football, where 290-lb. mus-
clebound hulks wrestle on turf.
Pitt strength coach Buddy Mor-
ris said that tests like those con-
ducted at some amateur events
are not administered to local col-
lege football players.

But, he emphasized, “steroids ’
have no place in college athlet-
ics. We are training our players
to improve their performance
on the field, not to become
weightlifters."

needs 25 points tonight to pass Don Hennon for second place on the

« all—time Pitt scoring list. Vaughan has 1,817 points in his career. The
6-4 forward was held to six points against Villanova, only the second
time in 63 games he has been held under double figures. The first time
was at Villanova Jan. 9, where he sprained an ankle three minutes into
the contest. Andre Williams was named Big East Player of the
Week, as his l5-for-2| shooting from the floor led Pitt to its two
victories last week. A win tonight ensures the Panthers of a winning
season. A A

Meanwhile, the Irish are on a two-game slide, losing at Rutgers
(61-59) last Thursday and DePaul (62-54) last Saturday at home.
Notre Dame is 12-2 at the ACC, with their only other loss at the hands
of UCLA. The Irish’s season has resembled a roller coaster ride,
beating Maryland and Villanova while losing to Northwestern and
Rutgers. With games like Brigham Young, Marquette and Dayton
after tonight, Notrc Dame is almost in a must-win situration in order

3 to secure a post-season berth.

The lrish’s forte is defense, as they are second in the nation in team
defense. Notre Dame has held nine teams to 50 points or less.

O’Neil swims tward b

By Lisa Grenevicld
The Pitt News

Not all athletes can fill the shoes
vacated by a three year All-America
like Jan Ujevich, but .a young New
Yorker by the name ofJodi O’Neil is
making believers of everyone.

O’Neil is in her freshman year as a
Lady Panther swimmer and‘is look-
ing forward to her first Big, East
Championships this weekend. Head
coach David Belowich has little
doubt that O'Neil can aid the Pitt
women in retaining their Big East
crown.

“On most teams, to lose two
swimmers like Jan [Ujevich] and
Sue [Heon] the same year would be a
disaster,” Belowich said. “It hasn‘t
had that effect on our team.
Through good recruits and a strong
nucleus of returners, we have over-
come the loss.

“We have several young swim
mers who have stepped in and taken
over the voids. Jodi takes care of the
breaststroke events, while her and
Tracy [Pfister] fill the voids in the
IM [individual medley] events.

“Jodi is an extremely talented
swimmer,” Belowich added. “She is
intelligent and a leader by action.

‘She is self-confident, but not cocky.
She has all the attributes of a great
athlete.” ,

O’Neil began her competitive
swimming career at the young age of
eight in Webster, New York. At the
suggestion of her father, she joined
the local AAU team when they first
moved to Webster. She continues to
swim for the MCC Marauders in the
off-season. I -

Good academics and a strong

swimming program brought O’Neil '

to the Pitt campus. She chose to
swim for the Lady Panthers over Big
East’ rival Syracuse and is happy
with the decision.

“I’m happy here,” O'Neil said. “I
enjoy the swimming and both the
coaches and my teammates are
great."

The first-year Lady Panther
swims in the breaststroke and indi-
vidual medley events, along with a

6 few of the relay teams. Her strongest

event, according to Belowich, is the
200 breaststroke.

“Very few people have beaten
Jodi in her events and she is unde-
feated in the 200 breast, by far her
strongest event,” he said. “If she can
swim some of her lifetime bests,
there is no doubt she’ll be on top in
the breaststroke and IM events."

O‘Neil’s top competition in the
breaststroke will come from Sarah

“Jodi and Wendy have been one-

two all season long,” Belowich said.

“Wendy has the natural speed, but

Jodi is a very strong swimmer. We‘

are stronger because of this combi-
nation of Wendy and Jodi. It leaves
me free to use them in other events."

Although there will be head-to-
head competition between team-
mates in this weekend’s champion
ships, O’Neil believes the‘ Lady
Panthers are going into it as a strong
team.

“No one’s against anyone,” she
said. “Everyone’s real supportive of
a good team effort. There’s no intra-
competition. We’re allivlooking to
win as a team.”

The Lady Panthers are making I

their final preparations for tomor-
row’s start of the Big East Cham-
pionships. They are resting and have
tapered down, which, according to

O‘Neil, means the reduction in yard- ‘

age and intensity. They are now con-
centrating on the finer points, such
as turns and stroke technique.

“I would say we're ready," Belo-

wich said. “We‘re rested and that’s a i

very important part. Enthusiasm is
good. It’s a controlled enthusiasm,
which is perfect. No one is being
outrageous. The key is to be in con-
trol, yet be excited. It’s something
you have to work at and I think we
are there.”

As defending women's cham-
pions, the Lady Panther‘s main
competition will come from Syra-
cuse and Villanova, with Boston

Wrestlers peaking despite losses

By Chaﬂie O'Hara
The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team has
battled some of the top-ranked
teams in the country over the past
several weeks. Although the final
scores didn’t result in any wins,
coach Rande Stottlemyer believes
his youthful corps of grapplers has
improved.

“I think we’re starting to peak,”
Stottlemyer said. “And if you want
to peak, now is the time with the
championships right around the
corner.”

Last weekend, the Panthers took
the best shots that No. 4 Penn State
and. 16th-ranked Lock Haven had to
offer and finished respectably, des-
pite losing both.

Lock Haven scored a 26-15 vic-
tory Friday night, while Penn State
notched a 29-10 win the following
day.

Against Lock Haven, the opening
match —— the 1 I8-lb. contest between
nationally-ranked Ken Whitzel and
Pitt's Bob Pisone — set the tone for
the rest of the evening.

Whitzel, whose specialty is head- A

locking his opponents, pinned
Pisone with his favorite move, put-
ting his team in the lead, 6-0.

,“The crowd really can have an
effect, especially when they win the
first match like that," assistant
coach Chuck Coryea said.

Sophomore Kyle Nellis got the
Panthers back in it with a decision
over Dick Howell, I0-5.

Gary Bolin gained Pitt's second
win (following teammate John
Hnath’s loss to Don Parsley) with a
narrow decision over Tom Kreamer,
7-6, in the 142-lb. class.

Senior Jeff Jelic later recorded a
major decision (an eight-point mar-
gin of victory) at I67 lbs. over Lock
Haven’s Doug Buckwalter, I4-6. Joe
Bond was also a winner at the 158-
lb. level. ~

The Panthers entered the ﬁnal
match trailing by five points and
needing a pin (worth six team
points) if they were to pull the upset
or a superior decision (a 12-point
margin of victory) for a tie.

Lock Haven‘s Rick Peterson took
care of that by pinning Curtis
Conner and completing the final
score of 26-15.

The Lock Haven bookends, Whit-
zel and Peterson, provided the mar-
-gin of victory in a match that was
otherwise surprisingly close.

Again on Saturday, Pitt faced a

superb bo_okend tandem, in Penn ..

State’s Carl DeStefanis, the second-
ranked 1 I8-lb. wrestler in the coun-
try and Steve Sefter, a defensive end
on the Lion football team who dou-
bles as a heavyweight wrestler. Sef-
ter, a senior who hasn’t competed
since his first year, was ranked fifth
in the country as a freshman.

The result was almost the same for
the Panthers.

DeStefanis pinned Pisone in 2:30
while Sefter scored a superior deci-
sion over Conner, 15-3.

The margin was again too great to

in the country going into last week-

end‘s matches is expected to move

him twice earlier this season.

“Intwo weeks, Jeff has beaten the
No. 7, 8, and 9 ranked guys,"’Coryea
said. “We believe that Ron Good,
who does the rankings, will move
Jeff up into the top eight."

Both Nellis (I26-lbs.) and Hnath .

(I34-lbs.) also‘ won their respective
matches.

In a losing effort Bond performed
well against Lion Greg Elinsky, the
eighth-ranked I58-lb. grappler in
the United States. Elinsky decisi-
oned Bond, 8-2.

“Almost every guy we wrestled in
had a winning

record,” Coryea said. “We feel our
guys are improving even though
we're getting beat, but that’s one of
the toughest things to accept."

Panthers
favored  
to repeat

The qualifying time for the 400-
yard freestyle relay is 3:00.72, while
the standard for the medley relay is
3:21.50.

One event which the Panthers
should be strong in is the 400-yard
individual medley, where Greg
Murphy and Don Martin are seeded
one-two, while three other Pitt
swimmers — Frank Williams, Rich
James and Dean Delibertis M are
also ranked in the top seven.

Other strong events for the Panth-
ers are the I00-yard freestyle, where
Bahan took the top seed and is fol-
lowed by James (5th), Martin (7th),
J.D. McCrillis (9th) and Murphy
(10th); the 200-yard backstroke,
where four Panthers dot the top
seven positions and the 50-yard
freestyle.

Lewis said the Panthers will be
weak in the I00-yard breaststroke
and butterfly events, as only one Pitt
swimmer is seeded in the top ten in
each of those events. Martin is
second inthe breaststroke and Rich
Lush is eighth in the butterfly.

With Pitt’s depth and the home-
pool advantage, Lewis believes his
team will be favored to repeat as
champions. ‘

“Our overall depth is our biggest
advantage,” he said. “Just about our
entire team qualified for the meet.

“Syracuse and Villanova are the
only two teams that really could give
us trouble. Villanova is very strong
in the breaststroke, freestyle and
sprints and Syracuse is strong
overall.”

The Orangemen took second
place last year, with 463 points to the
Panthers’ 530. Villanova finished a
distant third with 297 points.

Syracuse enters this year’s Big
East meet with several swimmers
seeded in the top three positions.
Chris Black has the number one
ranking in both the 500- and 1,650-
yard freestyles; Mike Wright and
Scott Henry hold the top two seeds,
respectively, in the 200-yard breast-
stroke, while Henry holds the con-
ference record and the top spot in
the I00-yard breaststroke; and Tom
Lewandowski earned top seed in the
200-yard freestyle.

Villanova complied a 10-3 dual
meet record mostly because of the
efforts of two swimmers. Sopho-
more Pete Maloney has not finished
below second in any event this year
and is seeded first in the 100-yard
backstroke, an event he took third in
the Big East Championships last
year. He is seeded second in the 100-

"yard freestyle and third in the 200-

yard backstroke. Junior Bill

Slamkow ski, a distance freestyle:
for the Wildcats, took third in the
1,650-yard freestyle during the 1983
Big East Championships and is
seeded there this year.

Besides those two teams, the only
other thing Panther swimmers have
to contend with is avoiding Lewis,
who is suffering from the flu .

“They have to stay healthy and
perform adequately,” he said.

Pitt divers perfect routines
for Big East championships

By Gabrielle Pease
The Pitt News

The Pitt divers know the meaning
of the word perfection.

They spend hours every day prac-
ticing to make the most efficient use
of the few seconds they have from
the end of the diving board_to the
water.

The Pitt divers will have a chance
to show everyone their capabilities
in this afteinoon’s first round of Big"
East competition.

What goes Into a dive? What gets
the diver from the end of the board
into the water?

It takes a deep breath, and the
confident thought, “rip it!” Lady
Panther Tricia Schultz says.

“It takes a lot ofdiscipline," coach
Julian Krug says. Krug’s divers are a
disciplined familyl Working
together, they perfect their short
opportunities to perform.

Here’s what a typical day looks
like:

6:50 a.m. The whole diving “fam-
ily” goes to Trees pool.

7:00 Weight lifting. Each diver
works to strengthen all the muscles

necessaryito carry out the dives that
are earning Pitt’s team its winning
reputation. Diver Mark McCor-

mick enjoys the weight workouts M

because of the power it gives him on
the boards.

7:45 Trampoline spotting. Each
diver in turn is hooked up to the

trampoline belt. Coach Krug assists —

them in practicing the motions that
refine a dive. The body must memo-
rize these moves in order to execute
the twists and somersaults from the
board to the water. Blood blisters
caused by vertical stops on the be1t‘s
halter dot the arms ofdivers Jennifer
Brown and Todd Mulzet.

2:30 p.m. Afternoon practice.
Each diver goes through his or her
“list” of dives. Tricks practiced on
the trampoline are perfected on the
diving board. For diver Mike
McCalley, the ultimate goal is to
make the Big East competition as
easy as afternoon practice.

7:00 p.m. Dinner, especially for
the lady divers is late and light.
These divers watch their weight ritu-

ally. Diver Patricia Ney attests to
not being able to eat before
workouts.

Evenings are tense, particularly
before competition. Often studying
is difficult. “Trying to catch up on all

my classes before Big East is the
hardest part,” says Mulzet.

“We're up against some really
good divers,” says McCalley. Yet
coach Krug is conﬁdent about his

‘“family’s’-‘ ability. “We have tre-i '

mendous potential,” he says. '

Sophomore Tricia Schultz, who
finished second on the one meter
board and fourth in the three meter
board last season, will be joined by
this season’s new divers Jennifer
Brown and Tricia Ney.

Returning on the men’s diving
team for a second Big East confer-
ence are divers John Dusch, Mark
McCormick, Mike McCalley, and

Todd Mulzet. They will bejoined by I '

this season’s new divers Chris Blair
and Jeff Luffey.

Men’s diving competition begins
tomorrow at l p.m. The Lady
Panthers’ diving begins Thursday
afternoon. Tickets may be pur-
chased at Trees pool.

‘Panther track team learns from tough competition

Bill Moorhead

Tli"e'“‘T’ittiNeVvs‘,’ Wedne’s‘day,'Fel5fuary TS, 1984

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

It sounded more like a NASA
press conference than an answer to a
simple question.

“At Boston, we did fair, but the
mission was not accomplished and
in New Jersey we did good, but
again the mission was not accom-
plished,” said Panther sprinter
coach Steve Lewis.

Although the answer sounds
strange, it was accurate in describing
the fortunes of the Pitt men’s track
team last weekend.

The Panthers were represented at
two meets over the weekend, the
Bud Lite Invitational in Boston and
the Olympic Invitational in East
Rutherford, N.J., and although they
didn't bring home any gold, they
obtained something that may lead to
gold in the future: experience.

For Panther middle-distance spe-
cialist Todd Colas, the weekend was
a learning experience. Colas placed
fifth in the l,0O0—meter run at the
Olympic Invitational, losing to
former two-time national champion

Villanova standout Don Paige.

Paige went on to set a new American
record of 2:18.88 in the race. Colas
finished fifth with a clocking of
2:23.22.

Although the finish was not what

either Colas or Pitt track coach John
Vasvary were looking for, Vasvary
still saw positive signs even in defeat.

“Todd made some mistakes but
still ran a good time," Vasvary said.
“If Todd had made mistakes and run
a bad time, we would have some
problems. Now all we have to do is
correct the mistakes, and Todd may
be right there.”

Vasvary said the same thing about
Panther hurdler Roger Kingdom.

“Roger ran well in the trial heat of
the 55-meter hurdles, but in the
finals, he hit the first hurdle and
couldn’t make up the ground,” Vas-
vary said. “The 55~meter hurdles are
so short that if you make one mis-
take, it’s all over.”

In Boston, the Panthers fared no
better as the distance-medley relay
team of Bill Moorhead, Alan Laws,
Garland Brown and Tim Manes
placed fifth. It was a case of a bad
start making for a sad finish. "

“Tim got caught in the back at the
start and we were always trying to
catch up,” said Vasvary. “Bill ran a
l:59 split [800-meters], and he

I wasn’t catching anybody. That was

sort of demoralizing.”

Vasvary was philosophical after
the performances.

“The time is gone, and now we
have got to look ahead,” he said.
“Sometimes good things come out
of bad races.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February I5, l9B4

Lady Panther Alicia Dugan en route to victory in the freestyle.

Lady Panthers prepare to

defend Big East crown

continued from page one
“That means that we should be at
our peak this weekend."

The fact that Pitt has been prepar-
ing all season for the championships
should result in faster times and bet-
ter overall performances. This is an
especially important factor for the
Lady Panthers because this meet
will be the last opportunity they
have to make the qualifying cuts for
Nationals. '

ln the past, swimmers have had
the chance to make their qualifying
times in the Eastern Championship
meet, but for financial reasons, the
women’s team will not be attending
that meet this year.

“The Big East is a now-or-never
situation if we want to make our
times for Nationals,” Burrell said.

The 400-yard medley relay will be
one event in which Burrell, along
with Susan Hickman, Tracy Pfister
and Denise Sedlacek, will be trying
to make the qualifying time. The

relays are some of Pitt’s strongest

events, although there is a lot of tal-
ent in the individual races.

Hickman, who is entered in the
50-yard freestyle, has already quali-
fied for Nationals in the event. Pfis-
ter will be up against some tough
competition from Beth Metger of
Villanova in the 100-yard butterﬂy
as she attempts to make her qualify-
ing time. A .

Dugan will be facing a rival from,
her high school days. Connie Sne-
deker of Syracuse had never beaten
Dugan until this past dual meet
season.

Coach Julian Krug said that the
women's diving team will receive the
toughest challenge from Sue Bales
of Boston College but contended
that Pitt’s three divers — Jennifer
Brown, Tricia Schultz and Tricia
Ney — are all healthy and psycho-
logically ready.

“We’re not a shoe-in to win,” he
said, “but we’re motivated to do well
in front of a home crowd.”

VILLANOVA

The Villanova Wildcats, who
placed third last year at the Big East
Championships, are led by two out-
standing seniors, Lisa McFadden
and Beth Metzger. The two have a
combined total of nine individual
and two relay records in their four
years at Villanova.

SYRACUSE

Syracuse is led by Connie Sne-1 ‘vi

deker, who swam on the conference
champion 400- and 800-yard frees-
tyle relay teams last year. Sopho-
more Sallie Cinco will also be
returning to defend her title in the
200-yard butterfly. ,,

BOSTON COLLEGE

Scoring 366 points in last years‘
conference championship, Boston
College placed fourth in the meet.
Diver Sue Bales will be the No. 1
competition for the Lady Panther
divers. She is described by Pitt div-
ing coach Julian Krug as having out-
standing talent.

ST. JOHN‘S
The women divers from St. John’s
will not be taken lightly according to
Krug. Patty Mullen and Lorreta
Cavavaugh will both be representing
St. John's on the boards. .
CONNECTICUT
The Lady Huskies are led by
senior co—captain Karen Redman,
the team’s second leading scorer all
seaon, and a versatile freshman,
Dana Redman, the team's top‘
scorer.

College _sporting a much stronger
team than last year. Pitt has already
defeated Syracuse this season, but as
always, everyone will be gunning for
the returning champions.

“l‘m cautiously optimistic about
winning,” said a grinning Belowich.
“We have a team that can win. But
it‘s really difficult’ to defend. You
can’t let down because someone will
be ready to knock you off.”

“It's been a great year so far,"
O’Neil said. “Despite a lot of new
people coming in at the beginning of

the season with all different person’ ..

alities, we have molded together. We
are a real close team and that's nice.
We’re coming together, looking
towards the Big East Champion-
