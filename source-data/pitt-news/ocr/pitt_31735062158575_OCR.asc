Academic Fete
To Symliolize
Scholastic Side

The annual Fall Convoca-
tion of Pitt students and fac-
ulty, originally scheduled "for"
Oct. 22, will be held Wednes-
day, Oct. 29, at 10:30 a.m. in
the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial Hall.

IThe date was changed due to a
conﬂict in the available auditor-
ium space.

The Convocation involves all
the Schools of the University, un-
dergraduate, graduate, and pro-
fessional.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld will ad-
dress the assembly. He will speak
on “Are Soviet Universities a
Challenge to the United States??'

The Chancellor’s address will be
based on his ﬁndings in Russia
during his visit there this past
summer. He headed a group of
eight American educators in their
visit to 18 Russian institutions of
higher learning.

The Fall Convocation will be
the occasion for the first major
address which the Chancellor‘
has made on his observations in
Russia. He will analyze the im-
port of these observations for
America and American educa-
tion. '

One of the two major academic
convocations held during the
school year, the -Fall Convocation

. symbolizes the central intellectual

purpose of the University.

Both the Fall Convocation and
the Honors Convocation are cere-
monial events and an academic
procession of the faculty is a tra-
ditional part of these events.

Classes will be dismissed from
10 a.1n.-noon so that students and
faculty may participate in the
assembly.

lots 60 To The Club  

The University has a unique facility which is not bein

utilized tothe fullest advantage by_ students. ‘

The Pitt W ildwood Club, a budding country club, was_
visited by members of the Pitt News editorial board re-

cently. . .
‘A feeling ‘of warmth and friendliness pervades the

 -newly reconditioned "club house.’ Classic meals are-served

at reasonable rates. These meals surpass even the Venetian
Room‘ in our Student Union. . ~ .
There is room for large student dances and meetings

iwhether of the All-University variety or those of individ-

ual organizations, fraternities,’ etc.

The National Convention of one of Pitt’s social frater-
nities was held recently-at Wildwood; over 600 delegates
attended and these were accommodated easily by the Club.

4 The Pitt Wildwood Club ﬁlls a void, that'mo.st city
Universities are unable to ﬁll. It provides the large rec-

‘ reational area that we lack in the central campus.

A Too many of our dvancesare held in the Student Union.
This «is not to cut one of our fastest growing and best insti-
tutions at the University,‘ but anything to extremes is un-
healthy. ' ' A T _

is Why. not utilize a building designed in the total Uni-
versity scheme of things for just such a purpose; '

Sometime soon, this year, Student Union Board, SGA
or some other‘ student group, if these two do not hustle,

-should take it upon themselves to organize an introductory
dancefor University students to see what there is to see at

» Wildwood.

This dance could be held without great expense, and
would contribute to a novel experiment which students at

, the University should do their best to foster in its infancy.
_ Its old age will then be assured.

Sentiment Hits Expansion

By Murray Chass

Any newspaper always looks for interesting and
lively “Letters.to the Editor.” Thus, a paper has its
eyes open for a story that _will provoke such
reader comment. . , ' _

In proposing an ‘expansion program for Pitt,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld became the 2- A
newspapers’ fond friend. For :-
since he made known his plans, -1
the City’s papers havebeen be-
sieged with letters concerning :
the expansion. __ ~ '

The editorial pages have in- '
eluded almost a letter per day.
Unfortunately, the overwhelming ‘
majority of these reader opin-
ions have been on the con side 

cellor, the ,University, and any other person or
group that has favored the “bold and dramatic”
idea. ' 0

Most Fear "Defacing"

ruin the beauty of the Oakland area: the Schen-
ley Plaza. Many have spoken against the tearing
down of the statue dedicated —'to Mary Schenley,

the woman greatly responsible for the construc-_

tion or the Plaza.

They have said that it is inexcusable to alter
Forbes Avenue, “one of the two main thorough-
fares in. the City.” One, reader has termed the
Cathedral of Learning a “modern monster.”_ To one
reader the only important thing in Pittsburgh is
Pittsburgh itself. It is more important than the
University of Pittsburghor any other institution.

Finally, another letter writer thinks that as Pitt
grows,bigger physically, it will reach out and take
students from sections other than the Tri-State,
or Pittsburgh in particular. Build the dormitories
for the out-of-towners and give them the scholar-
ships. Never mind about the City student.
Chancellor Like Nixon? '

Should the Chancellor, or the University, react '

‘like Vice President Nixon, when he read that 80
per cent ofthe public opinion was against United
States foreign ‘policy in regard" to the Far East,
and state that the people aren’t informed well
enough about the expansion program and are in
no position to speak against it? That the business
should be left entirely to those who are in charge?

We don’t advise that he_ does make a similar

These people have said that the University will?

statement, but more so than Mr. Nixon, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld-has reason to think in theabove terms

P and would be wise to pay little heed, if any, to

such adverse opinion. We say this because we must
consider the sources from which the condemning
expression has come.

"It is possible only to theorize what type of peo-— it

ple have written these negative letters, for we have
seen only their names and opinions in print and
have not met any of them. But we will theorize.

Because most of the writers have argued against .

the demolition of the Plaza and how Mary Schenley.
secured the money "for its original construction
and how it is a shrine to her, we feel that the
majority of these thinkers——-not all of them—_—are
men and women who are getting along in years,
the elders among us.
Writers Contraclict Themselves

No doubt, these people were around when Mary-
Schenley carried out her project. They recall with

’sentiment—a'nd that’s the key-word—her efforts.

Sentiment is a ﬁne emotion; but _had sentiment
prevailed when Pittsburgh’s redevelopment pro-
gram was begun, the Golden Triangle would not
be the place of beauty ‘it is today. One letter
writer uses the Golden Triangle to support his idea
that the Plaza should be kept to preserve the
beauty of the rest of the City.

The latest letter that appeared in one of the

papers talked about the alleged destruction of So]-

diers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall (this originally
was suggested by a City paper) and how that edi-
{ice is a great shrine to the men of Pittsburgh who
fought so valiantly in the Civil War.

He mentioned one of the ﬁghters whose name
was Jab Griﬂiths. The signee of the letter was "J.
W. Griffiths. Mere coincidence? Maybe. But this
shows -how far sentiment can carry a person.

The current adverse opinion points out the need
for the education of the people about education.
We no "longer live in! a world where we can learn
by‘ the light of the ﬁreside and do our work on
wooden tablets. .

Education and research demand facilities, facili-
ties that can encompass thestudent of"not only the
immediate area, but also the student from the far
distant locale who wishes to get the best education
in his chosen ﬁeld as possible.

This need for education far outweighs. the senti-
mental value of any piece of property. As diﬁicult
as it may be, the dissenters should realize this and
reform their opinions.

Gophers Hold Jinx V

In Panther Series

Tomorrow the Panthers meet an old nemesis when they
travel out to meet the University of Minnesota in Minne-
apolis before an expected crowd of 40,000.

The Panther began its series with the Gophers in" 1933,
but in the 25-year period they have onlyimet nine times
with the result being in Minnesota’s favor each encounter.

The last Gopher victory was in¢
1956 when the score was 9-6. In
that one the Panthers had a last-
minute touchdown by Joe Walton
called back because of a penalty.

Last season Minnesota had a
fourwon and ﬁve lost record.
In Big Ten play they ﬁnished
eighth with a three and ﬁve
slate. The Gophers opened their
season last week with a 24-21
loss to Washington. _ _

Coach Murray Warmath is in
his ﬁfth season as head coach and

men returning which is the small-
est _nucleus for any Minnesota
football team in many years.

Of the returning lettermen only
three are backs. The end corps
represents the most solid spot in
the Minnesota lineup. Five letter-

‘men are returning at the terminal

position headed by seniors Perry
Gehring and Ken Schultz.

At tackle are Norm Sixta and
Mike Wright. Guard is a weak
position, manned by only one
letter winner, Everett Gerths.

The backﬁeld poses a real prob-
lem‘ with its limited depth. Last
season Miginesotaihad two out-
standing quarterbacks in Dick
Larson and Bobby Cox, but both
have graduated, leaving only sen-
ior Jim Reese at the position.

Center ﬁeld at 1:30 pm.
