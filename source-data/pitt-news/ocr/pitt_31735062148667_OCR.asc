The Licadcrs

Printed below are the statements
which Jack Hoeveler, C40, and Jim
Kennedy, C40, Independent and
Fraternity spokesmen, respectively,
issued on the eve of today’s student
elections.

Despite the recent comments of
the free press the “bawdy politics”
this year are cleaner and fairer
than ever before. We have chosen
our candidates carefully-—basing
their selection upon their qualiﬁ-
cations as leaders, who are fair,
honest, and alert. They have the
sanction of an open and demo-
cratic convention and are, I feel,
the cream of the Independent crop.

We’ll win today if all those who
are members of our party live up
to the interest and enthusiasm
they have shown so far. With
good weather (Brotzman’s on our
side) honest elections and 100%
turnout of the Independent stu-
dents voting straight Independent
slates we will gain the majority
for which we have fought for the
last two years.

To the Fraternities we wish the

best of luck-—and)no hard feelings.

on either side.

Jllll KENNEDY

Sa °
Y~  

It is the belief of
party that this year more than in
any previous year both parties
have succeeded in slating the best
qualiﬁed men and women for the
various elective positions. We ask
the general student body to vote
as their consciences and good judg-
ment tells them to vote. Of the
fraternity men and women we ask
wl1ole-hearted straight slate sup-
port, for it is only by straight slate
voting that we can hope to elect
the candidates whom we believe are
best qualiﬁed-the candidates on
the Fraternity-Dental slates.

To the non-fraternity men and
women, we suggest two courses.
First if you are a member of the
Independent party, vote Independ-
ent. Sccond, if you are not a mem-
bcr of either party, and Independ-
ent leaders readily admit that all

.. axon-fraternity men and women
are not Independent-., then vote for
the best candidates regardless of

. their parties.

When the elections are over and
the votes are counted, we believe
that the student body will have se-
lected an outstanding group of stu-
dent governors and that both po-
litical , parties will! be adequately
represented.

Not Problem of City, States McNeil

By Fred Lange .

City traiﬁc engineer Donald M.

McNeil threw the confused parking

situation back into the lap of the
University this week.

“Student parking complications,”
declared McNeil, “are problems of
the University--not of the city.”

He revealed that he had received
a signed petition from 90 per cent
of the ,_,pr0peI‘ty owners on streets

’ “above'Bige1ow boulevard” request-

ing parking restrictions to give
owners “full use of their property.”

Property owners who signed the
petition asked for a no-parking re-
striction from 8:30 to 10 o’clock in
the morning and from 6:30 to 8
o’clock in the evening.

Dr. John Weber, secretary and
business manager of the University,
delayed retaliatory action, claiming
that it is better for the University
administration to wait until the Bet-
ter Traﬁic committee makes the first
move.

The City Traffic Engineering sub-
committee meets next Thursday,

Sororities Stage Panhel

Eger, Green Lead Ball Tonight

EVELYN GREEN

ALBERT EGER

Al Eger will set a campus precedent tonight when he leads a major
University dance for the second time in one year. He will escort the
chairman of the Panhellenic Ball, Evelyn Green, C41, Alpha Epsilon Phi.

Decorations for the dance will carry out an “all Greek” motif, and
special favors for the men are promised.

Jimmy Joy furnishes his “dance with Joy” music for dancing from
10 until 2 o’clock in Hotel William Penn.

To the fraternity which sells the most tickets over its quota will go
a gold loving cup, Miss Green announced.

McNeil said, but Dr. Weber pointed
out that the report of the sub-com-
mittee will be submitted to the Bet-
er Traiiic commitee and ﬁnal action
will be taken by that group.

Meanwhile, as the traffic engineer
and the University administration
trade statements, the parking situa-
tion enters its ﬁnal stage this after-
noon. The opening of Forbes Field
and the Pittsburgh baseball season
brings a second development in the
complicated situation, as more space
is being denied student parkers by
police.

Students may park in the Schen-
ley Plaza only on the east and west
sides during baseball games; the
center section will be reserved for
the automobiles of baseball fans, po-
lice announced. Cars parked in the
center area of the plaza will take
the risk of beinghemmed in.

The plaza parking" area will be
patrolled by traffic oﬁicers who will
question early-morning parkers as
to whether they intend to go to
Forbes Field or elsewhere. “Bleach-
erites” may park their automobiles
in the center section, but the class-
room-bound must park along the
sides, the statement declared.

Tickets Go On Sale

For Band Concert

The ticket exchange for the Pitt
Band home concert scheduled for
Friday, April 26, in Carnegie Music
hall at 8:15 o’clock, opens today and
will extend through next Thursday,
announces Clif Carlson, C40, student
director and manager.

The exchange will be open on the
ground ﬂoor on. the speciﬁed days
from 12:30 until 3 o’clock. The cou-
pon numbered 38 in the student ac-

4 tivities book may be exchanged for

one orchestra seat, one first balcony
seat, or two second balcony seats,
free of charge.

Additional tickets may be pur-
chased for one-half the established
rate. On this basis the price of or-
chestra seats are 50 cents, ﬁrst bal-
cony seats 40 cen.ts, and second
balcony seats 25 cents.

To the Winners:
Prestige, No Power

Memorial Hall will be littered with the annual
ac_cumulation of colored slate cards, party checkers,
and honest watchers at today’s elections.

To the winners in the balloting today will so
theprestige which l)~£‘lOll{J,'S to successful czmiplis
politicians, and a certain degree of control over the
University impotent student government. A I

Leaders of the l7raternity and l1.ide_pe11dcnt par-
ties have been quite frank this year in stating_;' their
c.la.inis for student support. Neither side has come
forth with one positive statement of policy. Both
sides have relied on the satliy overucrketl cry of
“Merit, merit?"

The fact. that neither party haslproposed any
constructive ideasor programs indicates that some-
thing is missing from Pitt student government.
That something is real power over student aifairs.
[Party leaders can’t be blamed for a situation in
which the effectiveness of student government is
hamstr-ling by division between SFA, VVSGA,
Men’s Council, and th.e school associations.

‘ No matter who wins today’s election, the re-
sult W0n’t shake the ‘foundations of the University,
because leadership in student g'overn1nent carries
with it‘ prestige but little power.

' Bu't it’s a nice honor to be a member of the
SEA assembly, so election chairman VVhitenian’s
staff will have a busy day taking care of 1700 stu-
dent voters.

Peace Council Sleeps
Through a War

“Today is a. good. time to make some stringent
coniments about Peace Council, for this is the day
when Council's annual peace assembly should have
been held.

‘ Every spring, for ﬁve years, the Council was
able to bring some prominent speaker to a large
meeting to give» students an opportunity to gain
some constructive inforination about peace, and to
allow them to show that young people in this Uni-
versity were not interested in going to war.

But that was all while there was no war going
on. Now that peace is an important reality to
most everyone, and now that constructive leader-
ship is really needed, Peace Council has spent a
strangely,letharg'ic year. To put. it bluntly, its
leaders have muffed every opportunity to_ do some-
thing for the cause they support.

‘Vile realize it is somewhat unfair to criticize a
group that possesses no resources, and performs
most ofits activities purely as a labor of love, a
group that receives only nominal support from the
more socially approved activities on campus.

_lBut nonetheless, ,P,e_,ace Council has been un-

necessarily dorm-ant: this year, and has not per- .

foi'n1ed even the minimum functions that it has
lIllPI'€4Vl0l1S years.

Peace is a vital thing to too many people at
the University, who now are left only to ﬂounder
around, not ﬁnding any group who can offer lead-
'9'f$1liP; 01' iI1f0rmat'ioi1, or even just plain talk.
Peace Council has a job to perform, and its leaders
ought. to get out and do it. I

In asking what we considered
to be the majority of Pitt’s most
eligible men it‘ they were attend-
ing Panhel--we found the answer
to be unanimously NO . . could-
it be that Pitt girls have found it
necessary to go off campus for
their dates? This cry sounds very
familiar. Those prominent men
who will not appear include Emil
Naric, Rich Harmon, Kal Kalwary,
Dave Bois, Harry Holt, Bob Good,
Harris Hawkins, Bill Allen, and D.
J. Bailey. Oh well, comes the
spring and some girls may regret.

We wonder if there is any truth
in the rumor that Rose Brennan is
going to ride -on the handle bars of
Jules Audy’s bike (star of the 6
Day Bike Races)—he is quite the
boy and from all reports also Rose’s
idol——guess you’ll have to learn to
ride a bike Buzz! It is reported
that the total number of coca cola
glasses broken per day in the new
Tuck Shop is in excess of 8.

Gee Skinner has gone the way
of all good men and has got him-
self engaged . . . Congratulations,
Gee . . . While musing over things
that are lacking in the Cathedral
the other day, we decided that one
thing deﬁnitely missing in the New
Tuck Shop is George, the friendly
little man with the broom. We
recommend that he be dressed up
in a pretty baby blue uniform and
added to the stalf of the place—he
contributes much needed at mos-
phere.

Tonight’s Panhel Ball should be a

i Top, dance what with Evelyn Green

leading with Al Eger and such
couples as Ginny Childress and
Gray Weller, Jack Stauff and Midge
Fnobouck, Margy Gibson and Joe
Rob“er?'s, Adeline Buter-1 and one of
the most eligibles—Bob Botkin—-
Alice VL-ally and Jack Carr of Med
School, and Dave Buente squired
by Nancy Sundstrum. It is said
that Bill Morton is quite perturbed
about some darn Duquesne Guy
who asked Peggy Brennan to a Du-
ouesne dance before Peggy had a
chance to ask Bill to Panhel.

The Bawdy Politic

By S. F. Ayers
To Would-be Politicians:

Lest anyone take this business of student politics
too much in earnest, it would be well to recall the atti-
tude expressed by Independent leader Jack Hoeveler
at his party’s nominating convention this spring:

“Don’t take yourselves or them too seriously. Have
a lot of fun during the campaign. Try hard to beat
thorn. After elections relax and forget about it.”

This statement is recommended to aspiring politicos
on both sides of the fence, who would do well to re-
meinber that today’s elections are by no means the
climax of their college careers.

S. F. Ayers Predicts

After the last tally sheet is torn from the voting ma-
chines tonight in Memorial Hall, the efﬁciency of the
political organization based on the 13 men’s fraternities
will probably have been demonstrated once more.

Unless the Independents are saved by perfect
weather and far greater spirit than they have demon-
strated thus far this spring, the ﬁnal result for SFA
will probably be: Fraternities 17, Independents 13.

This division of the SFA seats will allow both sides
to get three members of the executive committee, and
will allow the fraternity and faculty votes to elect Phi
Garn Joe Roberts president of SFA.

Naming the individual winners from the 42 slated
candidates for SFA is a tough job. Here’s the list of
winners as it looks from this corner:

Senior Men:
Joe Roberts, Jack Glenn, Rae Young, Bill McEl-

wain, Dave Buente, Rugy Aldisert, Dave Tucker, Roger
Powell, Fred Robie, Morton Lincotf.

Senior Women:

Adele Yorio, Dorothy Ann Carrier, Gene Pyle, Mary
Lewis, Virginia Halen.
Junior Men:

Jack Stauff, Leonard O’Connell, Jack Brady, D. J.
Bailey, Lew Riley, Ralph Nadler, Bill Donaldson, Hil-
lard Kreimer, Ben Foote, Hiram Milton.

Junior Wonlen:

Julia DeLeo, Suzanne Rigby, Charlotte Harris, Mar-
jorie Munroe, Bernadette Blatt.

Zeta Goes Independent

Most promising campaign of anyone not on either
Fraternity or Independent slates belongs to Julia Clem-
ens, Zeta Tau Alpha, running for a senior women’s posi-
tion‘ in SFA.

In addition to about 40 solid Zeta votes, Miss Clem-
ens may be able to count on an uncertain number of
sympathy votes from the smaller women’s houses, which
joined the Zetas in their approval of the Fraternity
Presidents’ Council “no-politics” plan.

Tri-Delt Job Hunter

Tri. Delt Charlotte Harris is on the voting machines
for two jobs in today’s elections——junior woman in SFA,
and College Association secretary. She is on a Fra-
ternity ‘slate for the SFA job, and has said that she
doesn’t want the other post. I

Fraternity men say that Miss Harris didn’t apply
for the CA job; Gene Tedick, Fraternity candidate for
CA president, pulled a ﬁrst-rate boner by ﬁling her
petition. -

In the recent women’s elections, Miss Harris was
elected president of the class of 1942.

Barone of)‘ CA Ballot

A last-minute blow to the Independent Party was
the declaration yesterday that Anita Barone, candidate
for secretary of the College Association, is scholastically
ineligible to run for ofﬁce.

She failed to approach a professor who doesn’t be-
lieve in student activities in time to have an incom-
plete grade cleared for the election.

Feature Soloist

By Mildred Caplan

"Featured in the University or-
chestra concert Wednesday night,
Wendell Otey, instructor in music
appreciation, distinguished himself
with the playing of the little-known
Dittersdorf Piano Concerto in A
Major. A - .

lV[r'L Otey handled the Mozart-like
work with delicacy and fine taste,
although the selection did not dis-
play his excellentpianistic accom-
pllshments. He was accompanied by
the University string? orchestra.
Representative Works .

Theodore M. Finney, director 0
the group", chose his program with
an eye toward providing an inter-
esting evening. It was representa-
tive of the work of the students,
who ﬁnd much interest" in playing
together. These examples of.,.types
of work they have; been" doing this
year proved that the orchestra is
serving as a valuableextra-curric-.
ular activity for those members
who are interested in instrumental
work. i

The playing of the Rimsky—Kor-
sakoﬁ‘ Polonaise and the Bach
Chorale and Fugue was ably
handled. Both of these numbers re-
flected the sureness of a group
which through long practice has at-
tained ﬂexibility and deftness.
These numbers‘ were”,the highlights
in an otherwise mediocre perform-
ance.

'I'c‘~a.iknwsky’s Fifth

-The Tchaikowsky Fifth Sympho-
ny was the only unfortunate choice
on the program. It requires a much
larger orchestra to give the work
its true value. The smallness of the
the rendition of the barbaric Fin-
orchestra was also a hindrance in
landia by Sibelius.

Also included on the program
were the Beethoven Overture to
Coriola-nus and the Prayer from

Student Deplorcs

Election Apathy
Editor, the Pitt News:

In the best of all institutions
there is usually one situation which
may be called deplorable. That so-
called state in the U. of Pgh. ﬁnds
its expression in the lack of stu-
dent interest and participation in
voting at the Spring Elections.

If non-voting by students in their
own elections just stopped there it
would occasion no comment. But,
because the very essence and value
derived from student activity is stu-
dent participation, I feel the voting
situation warrants a little discussion.

What are some of the reasons that
students don’t vote? Bad weather
—-lack of interest-—-too far to walk
---don’t know there is an election
being held—-not interested.

I-lave those students who don’t
vote for one of these reasons or for
one just as ridiculous, ever stopped
to realize that if the News staff, the
football team, or the committee
members ever failed to act for the
same reason, that there Wouldn’t be
a News, Pitt football games, or
school dances or S. F. A.
theater, to mention only a few of
the benefits accrueing to you? Don’t
forget, voting in Spring Elections is
just as much of a student activity
as any of the above mentioned.

For many students it represents
their only chance tovparticipate in a
student activity. They ought to get
into student life, feel at least that
they belong, go to the polls, heckle,
get heckled, and have some fun.
Students shouldn’t have to be drag-
ged by the scruff of the neck to
vote. It’s their election. Why
should they be just hangers-on‘? If
each person wereiresponsible for
one other person and himself vot-
ing, it could be said that Pitt is a
university whose studentsare inter-
ested in where their scliool is going.

Riley Demands

Evidence
Ilditor, the Pitt News:

Ilam directed by the members of
Druids to request that you produce
evidence in support of the alleged
quotation of a member of this or-
ganization as‘ editorially reported
under the pseudonym “S. F. Ayers.”

Otherwise, this organization re-
quests a retraction of this state-
ment in an early issue. —

, LEWIS RILEY,
,1 President of Druids.

Edito1"s Note———Rather than pub-
licly embarrass several colleagues
of Mr. Riley, we suggest that he see
the editor for the names of some
junior members of SFA, who can
verify the correctness of the ma-
terial to which he refers.

We assure Mr. Riley, that this ar-
ticle was not intended to «reflect
upon Druids. We feel that the in-
cident reported was not representa-
tive of the high ideals for which
Druids stand.

from the

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES,
who have been forgiven for last
year’s collapse and allowed to open
another season, pull into home port
today. With them, they bring a
new manager, a flock of new in-
ﬁelders and outﬁe-lders, new catch-
ers,  some new pitchers.

Unfortunately, the new manager,
Onkle Franz Frisch, is doing some
high class moaning about the cali-
ber of both his new and old pitch-
ers. But if Boss Frisch thinks he
has troubles, he should shoot a
quick glance at the mound corps of
our own Panther baseballers.

The glance would probably be
comforting to Frisch, but Ralph Mit-
terling, who directs Pitt’-s diamond
affairs, ﬁnds the situation, in the
words of the war correspondents,
“increasingly more grave.”

Disturbing Inﬁeld

There are ﬁve or six men on the
Pitt pitching staff. Approxim.ately
one of these has given promise of
better things to come. To this one
might be added a second if certain
undesirable traits in his hurling
makeup are ironed out.

Had it not been for some inex-
plainable and disturbing antics by
the Pitt inﬁeld, sophomore right
hander Eddie Jones, the one men-
tioned above, would have come
through with a 9-2 or 9-3 win in
his ﬁrst start. However, the in-
ﬁelders did bungle several plays
and Jones helped with 10 walks.
As a result, Duke was a 10-9 victor.

Southpaw Andy Johnson, who
was credited with all three of the
Panther triumphs last year, may
give Jones some aid, but his per-
formances so far have been discour-
aging. Johnson does his best work
when he is three or four runs be-
hind, although it would be less

wearing on Mitterling if Andy were
not so frequently trailing by three
or four runs.

Against Wake Forest, Johnson
gavve up ﬁve runs in the ﬁrst in-
ning, then clamped down until his
teammates had moved ahead, 7-5.
At this point Johnson fell victim of
a terriﬁc case of jitters, and the
southerners took the decision, 8-7.
in his other start in the South,
Andy watched the Panthers make
14 errors, get only one hit, and lose,
14-0. The blame for that one can
not be placed wholly on Johnson.

Wild Pitchers

Of the rest of the staff, little can
be said; in fact, the less the better.
The only other twirler who made
the Southern trip were Joe Treolo
and Ed Haluska, one of whom
couldn’t ﬁnd the plate and the other
found it too often. The pair work-
ed against Virginia and our only
comment is the score: Virginia 19,
Pitt 5.

Vague possibilities to crash the
regular lineup are Bob Geiger, an,-
other left hander, and sophomore
Jack Brady. Geiger, a transfer
from Duke, was ineligible last year.

No one can prove just how much
the loss of Jim Egan has hurt the
Panthers, but the boys are taking
odds that the Mitterling men would
be in much better shape with big
Jimmy tossing them in. As a fresh-
man he had enough stuff to push
Jones into a relief spot.

The way college schedules are ar-
ranged, a team can get along with
two strong moundsmen. Egan and
Jones would have ﬁlled the bill.
But Egan hit a scholastic snag. This
leaves Mitterling with Jones. If
Johnson can make the grade, every-
thing will be ﬁne; if not, the wailing
wall will have to be enlarged to ac-
commodate Mitterling.

Troubles Linger as Pitt

Nine Awaits Home Debut

Mitterling Continues Juggling Inﬁeld to Model
Strong Defense for Invading Indiaa Squad

Still plagued by uncertain base-
ball weather, the Panther nine
is continuing its outdoor drills in
an attempt to put the Panther de-
fense in a presentable condition for
the coming Indiana State Teachers’
game on April 27 at the Stadium.

According to Coach Ralph Mit-
terling the Panther inﬁeld still is
in a rather bad state. The difficul-
ties appear to be with the ﬁrst base
and third base positions.

Katz for Third

The initial sack received plenty
of going over in recent practice
sessions with Mitterling frequently
substituting ﬁrst sackers. At the
present time there are six men in
the thick of the ﬁght for the as-
signment. Lefty Drobnusky and
Guy Guadagnino still appear to
have the upper hand, however, on
their experience.

Also a vulnerable point in the

Panther defense is the third base‘

job. Here Mitterling is apparently
willing to string along with Larry
Katz, also a second sacker and
short stop.

Katz receives the nod over oth-
er candidates for the third base slot
by the consistent improvement he
has displayed in practice. Doubt as
to whether Katz had a strong
enough arm to play third was the
only reason for Mitterling’s delay
in using him earlier in the season.
Jones Hurt

The lone casualty to strike the
Panther squad came when Pitcher
Edgar J-ones recently reported for
work with a sore elbow. However,
the arm is responding to treatment
and will probably be ready when
the Pitt nine meets the Teachers.

Jones is believed to have injured
the elbow either in baseball prac-
tice or at spring football drills. Ed-
gar divides his time between base-
ball and the football ﬁeld.

Although the Panther defense is
nothing to write home about, their
hitting has shown plenty of prom-
ise. Except for a poor showing
against Maryland, Coach Mitter-
ling’s boys have been potent with
the bat. Three Maryland hurlers

held the Pitt nine to a single hit
while their teammates won, 14-0.

The leading extra base hitter
for the Panthers is ﬁrst baseman
Lefty Drobnuski. In games played
so far this season, Drobnuski has
collected a home run and a triple,
both against Duke.

Varsity Tennis
Candidates Meet

Candidates for the varsity ten-
nis team will meet in Hunt Armory
today at 2:30 o’clock for the se-
lection of the traveling squad.

Joe Kristufek will agan be cap-
tain and number one man, while
Weiss, Goehring, and Harmuth are
probable members of the ﬁrst sex-
tet. The remaining two starters
will be chosen by coach Dr. David
O’Loughlin from a group of about
half a dozen.

University Press p
Issues New Book

“Pioneer Life in Western Penn-
sylvania,” eighthin a series of books
relating to western Pennsylvania
history, was published recently by
the University of Pittsburgh Press.

Written by J. E. Wright and Doris
S. Corbett, the latest 252—page vol-
ume is illustrated with drawings by
Clarence McWilliams. The book
was published under the direction
of the Western Pennsylvania His-
torical survey which is sponsored
jointly by the Buhl foundation, the
Historical Society of Western Penn-
sylvania, and the University.

Although the book points to West-
ern Pennsylvania’s frontier life, it
also reﬂects a way of life repeated
again and again in various sections
of early America.

The book explains how the front-
ier family lived, how they worked,
what they ate, how they played,
their superstitions, their hopes and
fears. It goes on to tell of their
health, what they wore, how they
traveled, and ﬁnally, of the growth
of the ﬁrst towns and factories.

Thinclads Defend Clear Record,
Will Face Ohio State Tomorrow

Panthers’ Power
In Sprints Gives

Them Meet Edge

By Ben Foote

One of the few two-year unde-
feated records in collegiate track
starts on its third year‘, when the
Pitt cindermen seek an extension
of their mark over Ohio State at‘

Coliinibus tomorrow.

There are two records at stake in
tomorrow’s contest, for your News
track prognosticator, who called
every victory last season and hit
two scores on the nose, goes after
the ﬁrst leg in his second straight
string of air-tight predictions by
calling a 73-58 Pitt victory.
Sophomore Sprinter Hurt

The Blue and Gold thinclads
were dealt a severe Blow last Tues-
day when Bullet Bill Carter, na-
tionaly famous sophomore sprinter
was carried to the training room
with a pulled muscle. However,
Happy Stickel, Pitt’s other sensa-
tional yearling dash man, should
take care of the 100 yard dash even
without his running mate.

Frank Ohl, senior quarter-mile
sprint ace, gives the local spike-
wearers a probable one—two ﬁnish
in the 220. Stickcl holds the place
winning possibility.

The feature of the day pits Ohl
against Jack Sulzman, Big Ten
runner-up last season in the 440.
According to track psychology, the
Pitt’s veteran’s experience and rep-
utation will prove too much for the
Buckeye satelliate.

In the half-mile, the Olson-
coached squad will be without the
services of Long
John “money in
the bank” Wood-
ruff for the ﬁrst
time in three
years, but junior
Del A n d e r s o n
ﬁgures to be a
capable replace-
ment for the
E b o n y Flyer.
After Al Bou-
langer has push-
ed Eisenhart,
Buckeye distance
ace, to the limit
in the mile, An-
derson should breeze home ahead
in -the half.

Stickel Gets Top Ranking

ICAAAA champ Boulanger has a
tough assignment ahead of him,
for he must recuperate sufficiently
after the mile to take the two, but
opposition can’t be too tough for
the Hoosier two‘-mile sneedster.

According to the form charts,
that boy Stickel must be given top-
ranking again in the 220 yard low
hurdles, for this grinding timber-
topping, race is made to order for
the speed and power of the blonde
Adonis. Joe Newman, junior star,
should do no worse than second in
the 120 yard high barriers.

Johnny Bazyk, Brooklyn husky,
and Ted Konetsky, junior grid star,
give the Panthers the edge in both
the shot put and discus throw. In
the javelin toss, experience is on
the side of the Buckeyes, but soph-
omores Jim Elliott and Dusty
Rhoades will make the OSU star
put out every inch he can.
Should Win Relays

Ohl stands way out among the
broad jumpers, but the Pitt leapers
must. yield the advantage to the
Ohioans in both the pole vault and
high jump. Steve Linta, Big Ten
indoorchamp has beaten Rhoades,
top» Panther pole-vaulter, and two
of .Larry .Snyder’s athletes have
soared higher than Dave McDowell,
junior high jumper.

On the basis of Butler Relays
performances, the Pittites should
win the mile. relay tomorrow after-
noon. Standbys who make the
Panthers a threat in every relay
competition include Al Ferrara,
senior whom critics call one of the
best competitors in collegiate cir-
cles, Clyde Graf, junior to whom-
big names mean nothing, Larry
Tregoning, junior whoprovided the
necessary spark to carry the Panth-
ers over the_top last year, and Al
McKee, who has turned in several
great relay performances in a bril-
liant three’ year career.

Track Couch Olson
Gets Birthday Gift
From ‘His Boys’

“Happy birthday to you; happy
birthday to you; happy birthday
dear Coach; happy birthday to you.”

Panther track coach Carl Olson
looked upon his proteges with
mingled surprise and appreciation
as they chanted this well known
ditty when he entered the cafeteria
Tuesday night.

Without the Pitt mentor’s slight-
est inkling of what was in the air,
the spiked shoe outﬁt planned a
surprise birthday party with big
cake and all the trimmings for
training table on the Coach’s birth-
day.

After the meal, Frank Ohl pre-
sented a golden chain on behalf of
the 1940 track team “in apprecia-

tion of the great work of the best
track coach in University history.”
Olson thanked his squad with the
words, “The only thing that could
give me more pleasure than this
would be an ICAAAA outdoor
championship next June.”

Gridders Meet
In ‘Civil War’

Coach Charley Bowser stages his
first inter-squad test of the 1940
spring training season tomorrow
afternoon at Trees Field when next
year’s probable ﬁrst team, the
Blues, battle the 1940 second team,
the Whites.

The encounter will follow all the
regulations with. respect to periods,
penalties, and technicalities. This
affair affords the coaching staff its
ﬁrst opportunity to witness the 1940
squad under the ﬁre of competition.

No deﬁnite lineups have yet been
settled, but the Blues will probably
line up with Gervelis and Rettinger
at ends; Benz and Konetsky at the
tackles; Fife and Gradisek at the
guards; Since at center; Sekela at
quarterback; Thurbon and Jones
at the halves; and Kracum or Ross
at full.

The Whites will probably take
the ﬁeld with Stahl and Goodridge
or Al Gurzcenski at ends; John
Gurzcenski and Gartner at tackles;
Mitchell and Kapurka or Foley at
guards; Hawkins or Allshouse at
center; Wascovich at quarter; Saska
and Bonelli at halves; and Fitchko
or Ross at full,

Bert ‘ Jaﬂfe and the Pi Lams
swamped a weak Lambda Chi outﬁt
last Monday, 9-1. Pitcher J affe kept
the losers’ hits well scattered. Mat-
tes and Englesburg led the Pi Lam
sluggers with two blows apiece
while Ollis and Hunter showed well
for the Lambda Chis.

Phi Kappa nosed out the PiKA
team, 6-5. Connell pitched and hit
the Phi Kaps to the victory as he
bore down in the pinches and drove
out three safe smashes off PiKA
Weightman. Schusterv made a round
tripper for the PiKAs.

Oil & Gas will aim for their sec-
ond consecutive victory today
against the once-beaten AE & ME
team. Oil & Gas has in Bielek one
of the outstanding pitchers in the
Engineering loop and should hold
the AE & ME nine to a low score.
AE & l\/IE’s main hope lies in

Kramer to Lead

Pitt Golf Team

Against Lions

Bill Kramer, one of the most
promising golfers ever to swing a
club for the Panthers, has ﬁnally
been declared eligible and will play
in the number one spot when the
Pitt linksmen open their season at
State College tomorrow.

Kramer had previously been held
back by an incomplete 011 his blue
print but has succeeded in making
up the work, the registrar’s office
has announced.

The addition of Kramer to the
ranks gives Coach Art Underwood
a more formidable outﬁt than had
been expected, although it is un-
likely that the Panthers will enter-
tain any championship hopes.

Last year the Lions had little
trouble in subduing Pitt after they
got past Tony Kaye and Bill Dad-
dio, the Cathedralites’ aces. The
starters are somewhat of an un-
known quantity this year.

Behind Kramer will play a team
of four veterans and a newcomer.
Bob Seybold will work as number
two man, Bill Geyer follows at
number three, Bill Reilly tees off
number four, Homer Mcclintock
plays ﬁfth, and Jim Kennedy makes
his ﬁrst appearance on the squad
in the number six slot.

Of the sextet only Reilly and
Seybold competed much last year
although Geyer and McC1intock ap-
peared occasionally. Replacements
for the group are Rees, Glenn and
Sam. , .

The squad will leave late today
for State, and will meet the Lions
tomorrow afternoon.

As Outstanding Student

Senior in Engineering
School Wins Honor
At Association Affair

VVi11iam J. Edmunds, IE, re-
ceived the award of the out-

standing senior in the Schools of
Mines and Engineering at the
Engineers’ A.ssociation smoker in
Trees Gymnasium last night.

Edmunds, who was presented
with the award by E. A. Holbrook,
dean of the Schools of Mines and
Engineering, is president of Phi
Gamma Delta and vice president of
the Interfraternity Council. He is
a former member of Druids and
was on the freshman basketball
squad.

Students and faculty submitted
the names of ﬁve seniors, each of
whom was outstanding in his de-
partment. Candidates for the award
besides Edmunds were: Patrick J.
Cusick, civil engineering; Ray A.
Wolferndale, ’ mechanical engineer-
ing; Paul F. Gibson, aeronautical
engineering; and D. Michael Mitsak,
chemical engineering.

A committee consisting of Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men,
Robert R. Corley, assistant dean of
men, and Dr. W. George Crouch, as-
sistant professor of English, met in
the oﬁice of Dean Holbrook to‘de-
cide the award winner Wednesday.

A junior membership in a nation-
al A engineering society which may
be chosen by Edmunds also goes
with the award.

Merits considered by the commit-
tee were scholarship, leadership,
personality, and practicality.

Poll Indicates r
U. S. Students
Go to Church

By Student Opinion Surveys
Of America

, AUSTIN, TEXAS, April 18.-——As
church-goers, American college stu-
dents give themselves a good grade,
a national poll of the Student Opin-
ion Surveys of America just com-
pleted reveals:

(1) Only one-eighth declare they
never attend church; 40 per cent
say they go regularly; (2) A slight
majority of students state they go
to church more often or at least
about ‘as frequently as they did be-
fore they came to college.

The poll, taken’ by personal in-
terviewers fronilcoast to coast, pro-
vides the ﬁrst complete answer to
the signiﬁcant question often asked:
Db college students lose some of
their religiousness when they leave
home? A good number, 46 per cent,
admit they attend services less often
than they did before they arrived
on the campus.

Catholics Take Honors

'.What may be surprisin.g to some
is that 15 per ceni of the students
say they are going to church more
often than when they were at home.

Catholics appear in the results as
the least apt to change their habits
on religion upon leaving their
homes, and they take honors for
regular church-going.

Tabulations of church-attendance
habits for the entire college and
university enrollment of the nation
are given below. It should be con-
sidered that Jewish church services
often conflict with campus social life
and scholastic schedules, thus the
lower attendance shown than for
the Gentiles.

Results of P011 .

The question, of whether they at-
tend church regularly was answer-
ed in the affirmative by 39 per cent
of Protestants, 75 per‘ cent of the
Catholics, 9 per cent of the Jews,
and 24 per cent of other religions
combined.

-When asked whether they attend
church more often than they did
before they came to college, 16 per
cent of the Protestants said that
they did, while only 10 per cent of
the Catholics and 12 per cent of the
Jews have increased their attend-
ance. _

Results of the poll are given be-
low:

casionally, or never?

SEA Members Fail to Produce

Quorum at Year’s Last Meeting

As next year’s Student-Faculty
Association moved toward a climax
at the polls today, this year’s assem-
bly ﬁzzled to a finish when it re-
corded its ﬁrst “no-quorum” meet-
ing of the year last Tuesday eve-
ning.

When repeated roll-calls failed
to ﬁnd more than 17 out of 40 mem-
bers present at any time, the regu-
lar monthly business session was
limited to a review of the minutes,

iree committee reports, and light
refreshments served on the twelfth
floor.

Sam Whiteman, chairman of elec-
tions reported on election proce-
dures and declares that identifica-
tion cards would be necessary for
admission to the polls.

The Parking situation enter-
ed the discussion and Dave Bu-
ente, C41, chairman of the parking
committee, announced that his com-
mittee had reached an impasse.
“Everything has been done that we
can do,” he said.

Letters had been sent, he report-
ed, to the city ofiicials by both SFA

The largest number of votes ever
received by a candidate was 466 for
Mercedes Shiring in 1938. Top man
last year was Ted Konetsky, who
received 328 votes.

Running for reelection on Frater-

nity and Independent slates are the
following members of the assembly
of SFA: Joe Roberts, David Tucker,
Roger Powell, Robert Heape, Wil-
liam McElwain, Rae Young, David
Buente, Ruggero Aldisert, Gene
Pyle, Adele Yorio, Dorothy Ann
Carrier, Mary Lewis, and Esther
Marcuson.
, Last year’s elections saw 17 Fra-
ternity and 13 Independent candi-
dates named to SFA; eight Frater-
nity and two Independent candi-
dates to Men’s Council; aand four
Independents to the offices in the
College Association.

In 1938, Fraternities won their
celebrated “plebiscite” when their
coalition with Independents and the
Dental block swept 27 out of 30
seats in SFA. That year, Fraterni-
ties took all 13 position in Men’s.
Council and the four CA ofﬁces.

The Independent Party goes into"
this election with experience of one
election behind it.- Growing out of
the hastily-formed Independent-In-
dependent group of 1938 which
elected Jack Hoveler, Mary Gregg
and Gertrude Broido to SFA, the
party organized last year and met
its first test in the 1939 elections.

tributed and collected at the end of
the voting line.

Whiteman explains that the iden-
tiﬁcation cards will be stamped ﬁrst

University. The Schenley plaza,
Buente pointed out, would be used
beginning Friday for the baseball
patrons, and the Nicola Company
was oﬁering a special parking rate
to students who cared to use Ruskin
ﬁeld.

All the committee could do now,
Buente said, was to await the re-
sults of next week’s meeting of the

Better Traffic Committee, who
would consider the University’s
problem.

Mary Mills, C40, reported for the
Spring Festival Committee.

The report was devoted to tenta-
tive proposals for the events of the
week, and to whether the tap day
should be held at Memorial hall or
on the Cathedral lawn. No decision
was reached.

Pat Cusick, E41, president of
SFA, announced that the Finnish
relief fund drive was being dropped
since the executive committee now
felt that the project was not wide
enough in scope.

You Can See the Ball Game Today

By Gertrude Lieblich

Oh, to be a Cathedral window-
washer this afternoon at 3:15!

It’s a fact that these window
pane-polishers have the best View
of. Forbes Field and of the opening
game between the Pirates and the
Cincy Reds today. But less fortun-
ate students can also see the game,
or portions of the game, from Ca-
thedral windows—provided they
choose their observation post with
care, a hasty Pitt News survey re-
veals.

For instance, you can see right
ﬁeld, center ﬁeld, and home plate,
if you’re lucky enough to get be-
hind the counter in the Men’s Tuck
Shop. You may have some difficul-
ty with Bill Kofmehn, Thiel ’37, but
remember, he only runs the place.

ﬁrst-base coach, although it is a
little hard to read his signals from
the Tuck Shop. Of special interest
to the male observers is the view
of the right-ﬁeld stands, which, on
Thursdays, seat several thousand
ladies. But let’s not get into the
fine points of the game.

Should a runner advance to sec-
ond base, you must leave: the Men’s

Graham, professor of journalism
and director of the University News
Service. In this office are four win-
dows, three of which are dirty.
You’ll ﬁnd Mr. Graham pressed
against the fourth.

On the twelfth ﬂoor there is a
super-special vantage point. From
the Forbes street window of 1212,
you can see the whole outﬁeld and
second base. There is also a ﬁne

view of the parking situation and
the horizon, in case the game slows
up.

From 1617 you can see everything
but home plate. If this minor
omission annoys you, just pretend
that you paid $1.65 and had to sit

On any ﬂoor above the twenty-

a wider view, you lose because of
the additional distance.

In conclusion we might expose
some deliberate misinformation
which has been circulating. It is a

Arts Department Will Present
Documentary Film, ‘The City’  

“The City,” third in a series of
documentary ﬁlms produced in the
United States will be shown at 3:30
o’clock this afternoon in the fine
arts department, seventh floor.

The picture is an attempt at art
in the relatively new field of un-
posed cinematography. Photo-
graphed and directed by Ralph
Steiner and Willard Van Dyke,
well—known arti.st-photographers,
the ﬁlm avoids the dullness that
some deign to classify as social sig-
niﬁcance by combining artistry of
camera-work with unity and sim-
plicity of idea. 4

It is an experiment in coopera-
tion between. photography technique
and fact-recording. As such, it sur-
passes the newsreel in its well-
planned coherence of theme.

The ﬁlm itself is in five sections.
First are the scenes in a New Eng-
land village, depicting the lack of
embellishment and the primitive
quality of the town in its ﬁrst
stages.

The second scene, “Industrial
City—City of Smoke,” contrasts the
sordid misery of the worker and his
family with the industrial advance-
ment of our civilization.

Part three, “Metropolis-—Men in-
to Steel,” reveals the day to day ac-
tivities of millions who crowd the
large cities of the world.

“The Highway——The Endless
City” points out the utterly unnec-
essary stupidity of the traffic jam
and the trafﬁc problems appearing
in congested cities.

The last section, “The Green
City,” unveils the conclusions drawn
from observation of conditions in
the first four. In the planned city
of the future, according to this ﬁlm,
there will be “plenty of open space,
plenty of air, light, grass, trees.”
Already in existence are planned
cities with well-ventilated, easily-
accessible- factories, libraries, mod-
ern efficiency kitchens, and l.eisure
time to enjoy these and other facil-
ities.

Test cities such as Bradburn, N.
