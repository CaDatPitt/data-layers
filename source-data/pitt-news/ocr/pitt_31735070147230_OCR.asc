Six vices inspire fashion show

A model for the Black Action Society’s fashion show personiﬁes the vice wrath at the group’s event this weekend. 

Emily Marmion
Staﬂ" Writer

When a model for the Black Action
Society’s annual fashion show strut-
ted down the walkway with eight-feet
long tree branches harnessed to her
waist, she was personifying the vice
wrath.

» She was one of 60 models who
participated in the fashion show,
called “Capital Vice,” which brought

more than 1,0QO people’ to the .

Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Down-
town Hotel Friday night. .
Four of the eight local college de-

signers were Pitt students, and about

90 percent of the models attended
Pitt. Most of the models were part of
Pitt’s Black Action Society who, with
the help of other local Pittsburgh col-
leges, put on the three-hour show.

Brittany Moreland, a Pitt senior
and the fashion show’s coordinator
and creative director, said the pur-
pose of the annual fashion show is
to give student designers — as well
as a handﬁil of localbusinesses —
the opportunity to “showcase their
clothes and creativity.”

But Moreland made sure to incor— ~

porate other aspects into the ‘show. A
strongproponent of community ser-

o xt.!i:i‘¥.l'i'*?‘

vice, Moreland and others involved
with the production put together lit-
eracy packages for underprivileged
elementary school students.

The night wasn’t just about com-
munity service. For Moreland, it also

presented a chance for the event to .

make up for its 2010 absence. After
last year’s show was canceled be-
cause of Snowpocalypse, Moreland
was set on creating a fashion show
to remember.

“I had been a model in the show
since my freshman year, and I re-

member how much of an impact be— '

ing a part of the show had on me. I
had avision to make this an awesome

Sarah Kontos I Staff Photographer

experience for everyone involved,”
Moreland said. a

She said the experience gave-her
self—conﬁdence, ﬁiendship and a cre-
ative outlet outside of schoolwork.

“I wanted to showcase an array
of clothing styles, both diverse and
unique, having the ability to appeal
to any and every student in the audi-
ence,” Moreland said of this year’s
show. “I chose Capital Vice in [an]
effort to capture drastically differ-
ent moods and still have a cohesive
production.” ' ‘

In memoriam: Pittlfreshman Ryan McGovern  

Philip Bombara
Staﬁ Writer

Ryan McGovern was a straightforward
young man who knew what he wanted
from life. ‘
“You know, I think he had the next ﬁve
to 10 ‘years of his life all planned out,” Ry-

an’s aunt, Lisa Friello, said. “He was very i

into the ROTC and knew that was what he
wanted to pursue. He had an uncle who was
in the Air Force and I think he lookedup to
him quite a bit.”

McGovern, a freshman, died unexpect-
edly on Feb. 13 in Beaver County, where

his family lives. He died at Heritage Valley A

Beaver, a hospital in the area.
Beaver'County Coroner Teri Tatalovich-

Rossi said the cause of death ispending an _

investigation. She said she did not know
when the investigation would conclude.

A graduate of Hopewell High School,
about three hours east of Pittsburgh,
McGovern played volleyball for the
Hopewell Vikings for four years, lettering
both his junior and senior years.

-. Many people involved in -his life said that

McGovern was committed to Arm"y'ROTC_.

His older brother, Patrick McGovern, said

he was a devout Pitt fan. .
“Ryan loved Pitt. It was the only school
he applied to. I think it had something to

do with my loving Penn State, and being my.

younger brother, he loved -to annoy me,”
Patrick McGovern said. “If I had to guess,
I would have to say that about half of our
conversations had to do with Pitt and Penn
State.” ‘

' For the past two years, the brothers had
been saving their spare change to buy tick-
ets to the next Pitt vs. Penn State football

matchup, whenever it might happen. At last
count, they had $250.
' Ryan’s favorite part of the ROTC was the

A physical training. With intentions of going

to basic training this summer, Ryan wanted
to ﬁnish his time in college as a member of
the Army National.Guard and, after gradu-
ation, go on to active duty with the hope of
serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. Beyond that,
he had aspirations of working with either
the FBI or the CIA, his brother said. I

Patrick McGovern went on to say-that','in
a lot of ways, Ryan was like a little “brother
to a lot of_Patrick’s friends. ‘

“I never messed with him’ in that stereo-

’ . typical older brother way, but my friends

sure did. He never complained and sort of
enjoyed it. He hada little rivalry with my one
friend who went to WVU, and they often ar-

I guecl about the football or basketball Back-

yard Brawls,” the older McGovern "said. ,
The Pitt freshman wasa fan of reality
TV, Olympic gymnastics and Glenn Beck,
and his love of Pitt was no secret to those
who knew him. . ' ,
Ryan McGovern’s Sutherland suitemate
and closest friend at Pitt, Marc Pelberg, said

that he and Ryan wentto all the football
games and as many basketball games as

they could get ticketsto.

McGovern and Pelberg could often b.e
found together lifting weights in Trees Hall
or playing basketball. In both exercise and

‘social interactions, McGovern was always

level-headed and never lost his cool, even

when Pelberg would try to get a rise out

of him. I . ,
“I remember this one time we were in the

. gym lifting and deciding onlwhat exercise

to. do next, and Ijust turned to him, threw

. my weights down and screamed at the top

of my lungs ‘What do you want to do next,
Ryan?!’ but all he did was smirk,” Pelberg

A said. “That’s just the kind of kid he was.”

‘After spending a great deal of time with
him throughout the year and planning to
live with him next year, Pelberg said Ryan

I McGovern was one of the nicest kids he ever

had the pleasure of knowing.

“I wish I would have had time to get to
know him better. I onlylknewhim for a short
time and even though I was lucky.enough

V to have so many experiences with him and

getting to know him‘ as well as I did, I wish-I
could have gotten to know him even better,”

Social networking
good for dating

College students have interest-
ing priorities. Apparently we put
our school work and ultimately
our career ambitions before our
quest for the perfect mate. At
least, that’s the premise behind
a new dating website for college
students.

A business student at Colum-
bia University developed Date-
mySchool.com to eliminate the
need to have an offline social
life in order to find a signiﬁcant
other. Students can simply take
a small break from the research
papers they are writing to log
on and find their own special
someones. The site recently re-
ceived $500,000 from private
investors, according to The New
York Times.

Although the service is cur-
rently limited to only a few
schools, the website is in the
process of expanding — though
users will require a .edu e—mail
address to register, as was
required in Facebook’s glory
days.

If it makes it here, we antici-

pate that the website would be
well received by the Pitt commu-
nity based on its popularity at
Columbia — the site currently
has 7,000 users.

Though it might seem that
personal career ambition is
destroying romance, we think
dating websites don’t actually
do much to change the dating
game. DatemySchool;com al-

lows its users to restrict their‘

search results based on attri-
butes like religion, body type
and major.

Shallow?

Maybe. But don’t we do this
offline as well?

Dating websites also help to
take fate out of the dating equa-

 

tion. Why wait to bump into your

. dream date at the laundromat

when you can search through
many potential candidates from
the comfort of your computer
chair?

We don’t think the site will
see as many members as Face-
book, but that’s not really the
point. It offers a distinctive ser-
vice -—— dating — with the con-
venient feature of allowing users
to search for matches with cer-
tain attributes. Datemyschool.
corn’s strongest chance for suc-
cess lies in the fact that Face-
book doesn’t currently offer this
type of advanced search, and the
app that used to alert you when
your love interest became single

was shut down last week. Hey,‘

no’ one ever said dating wasn’t
a little bit creepy — online or
offline.

The site also promises to offer
an elitist environment through
its college e—mail requirement
for registration — elitism we’re
sure many college students miss
from the Facebook days free of
friend requests from 15-year-
olds who currently attend your
old high school. The site also
aims to decrease the embar-
rassment associated with online
dating through its many options
for privacy and selectivity. Ac-
cording to The New York Times,
“users choose which schools and
programs can view their online
profiles, which remain invisible
to others.”

So who cares if we prioritize

our education over our future.

marriage engagements? Good
grades are sexy and will bring
the boys and girls to the_yard.
And if/when they don’t, we’ll
social—network-date each other
’til death do us part. 3

We love letters. 4

VA MIDWESTERN PIECE

A deﬁnite deﬁcit problem

Mark Kozlowski

What happens when the government
carries a credit card balance that ex-
ceeds one—sixth the value of all the
goods and services produced every

year in the entire world? Well, we’re .

in a position to ﬁnd out. The U.S. na-
tional debt exceeds $14 trillion, which
is roughly 100. percent of the U.S.

annual GDP. The_ budget Congress is .

consideringfor the comingﬁscal year
has a deﬁcit ofbetween $1.1 and $1.6
trillion, which about equals the value
of all goods and services produced in
the U.S. in a month. That’sjustthe gap

between how much the government ,

spends and how much the govem—
ment gets as revenue. This glum pic-
ture doesn’t even include the serious
problems individual states have with
their own budget shortfalls.

The size of the deﬁcit is a serious
problem. Lenders only have so much

money, which they lend to the gov-

ernment, private enterprise, prodigal
brothersrin-law and so forth. when
the government issues a lot of debt,

' it creates a huge demand for ﬁinds ,

Columnist

providedby lenders. Lenderswho give
their money to the government are
not lending it to private enterprise.
Private businesses then have fewer

. people willing to lend" to them and

in order to attract any investment at
all, lenders are forced to offer higher
interest rates. This effect, known as
“crowding ou ,” cuts into business
proﬁtability and makes it less attrac-
tive to start or expand businesses. In
this way, a persistently large deﬁcit
will be a brake on the economy.
Another problem caused ‘by
the expanding national debt is that
progressively more and more of the
budgetis required justto pay interest.
With more money given to debt ser-
vice, less money is availableto pay for
useful things’ like highways, aircraft
carriers and the like. It also means
less ﬂexibility in terms ofﬁscal policy,
asjapan is ﬁnding out. You can only
roll out so many $800 billion stimu-
lus packages before youﬁnd outthat,
oops, peoplewon’t lendto you money
anymore. This is what happened in
Greece, and there’s no reason why it

V couldn’thappen here. Although risk of

default is still remote for Illinois, it is
interestingto note that Illinois bonds
are rated the same as those of Portu-

gal. This is a problem, as investors
will demand a higher rate of interest

on government debt to compensate .

for the fact that they aren’t so sure
if they’ll get paid back at all. When
this happens, it means that still more
money is required to pay interest on
the debt, further constraining our
ability to do anything else.

So we have to do something. But
what? Well, we have to either: a) cut
spending, b) increasetaxcollection or
c) both. Both solutions are difficult po-
litically. Ifyou attempt to slash spend-
ingby asking governmentworkers to
contribute more to their health insur-
ance, as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker-
is doing, you end up with the oppos-
ing party in the state Senate skipping
town, leaving you to deal with angry
protestors inside the capitol rotunda.
If, on a federal level, you try to touch
the great white elephant of Social se-
curityor other entitlement programs,
you get angry old people who accuse
you of forcingthem to eat dogfood. If
you raise taxes, most everybody gets

upset. All three of these solutions ’ -

are, in effect if not in fact, exactly the
same: you are taking money away

from peoplewho feel entitledto it. So '

A debt
solution

Itozlowskk 6

it’s tempting to do nothing at all. But
doing nothing means that eventually
we simply won’t be able to pay for ev-
erything. At that point, wewill simply
have to raise taxes and cut spending,
as Greece had to do. There will be no
other choice. ‘

These two fimdamental realities,
that we need to solve the problem of
the deﬁcit and that somebodyis going
to have to pay for that solution, have
been lost on far too many people. For
example, quite afewinMadison, Wis.,
have categorized Wa]ker’s budget cuts
as attempting to destroy American
families by reducingbeneﬁts for pub-
lic workers. Allow me to ask: Where
does the money to pay for these ben-
eﬁts ultimately come from? It comes
from other American families who
have to pay income, sales, property,
payroll, Medicare and other taxes.
This is not to say that government
employees shouldn’t have beneﬁts
or that people shouldn’t have to pay

’ taxes. Butwehavetokeepinmindthat

every dollar the government spends
hasto come from somebody. ‘
What exactly needs to be done
about the deﬁcit? The recommenda-
tions of the Sirnpson-Bowles com-
mission are a good place to start. The
bipartisan debt comrriittee came up
with a number of solutions that were
supportedby, among others, Sen. Dick
Durbin (D—Ill.) and Sen. Tom Coburn
(R-Okla.) —hardly people inthe habit
of agreement. The panel’s recommen-
dations have also been roundly com-
mended by members ofboth parties,
which certainly suggests compromise
is possible. Maybe there are better
solutions to, the deﬁcit problem, but
one thing is clear — we can no longer
pretend that there isn’t a problem.

'rHArs WHAT sue SAID P

Gossip not just for high school students

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

As with most things, there are
two sides to the gossip coin.
One is the warm feeling you get
when talking about a mutual
acquaintance with a friend —
good gossip, sharing news. The
other is the stomach-ﬂip you get
when you realize that someone
is sticking his or her nose where
it shouldn’t go. Hey, stayoutta
there.

Remember high school? Me

neither. I was one of those girls .,

who did her own thing, kept to a
close circle offriends and spent
four years virtually unnoticed +
in my? humble opinion, the best
way to spend the ages of 14 to
18. But I wasn’t so invisible that
I didn’t hear the rumors about
pregnancy, expulsions, so-and-
s_o in the football locker room.
I’m not gonna lie, I got pleasure

out of it too ——- that’s why we .

read celebrity magazines, right?
We like to. hear about people at

the top of the pedestal messing I

up somehow. Who wasn’t inter-
ested in Tiger Woods’ lady ha-
rem and the golf club through his
windshield? I know I was.
Anyway, by the time I got to
college, I thought that everyone
would have relaxed with this
stuff a little bit. False. Once you
move past freshman oblivion and
start to see people in the same
circles, the gossip continues — a
little more pointed and a little
more uncomfortable. After all, in
Pittsburgh there are usually only
two degrees of separation.
Here’s what I’m wondering:
Why doesn’t it stop? And why do
we continue to care about oth-

ers’ personal lives — lives that,
at times, have very little to do
with our own?

Well,-ﬁrst of all, people are
social animals. Gossip helped
forge our identity in early times,
when we all lived in small com-
munities. “Did you hear who
slept on Urg’s hide pallet last
night?” was probably one of the
first interrogatives ever uttered.
Kidding. Still, according to re-
search in evolutionary psycholo-

we can use at a later time to help
with our own social promotion.
It makes your friends feel closer,
because you’ve’ told them a se-
cret, you’ve conﬁded in them.
As much as I hesitate, gossip,
it seems, might be good for us.
As Oscar Wilde said, “There’s
only one thing worse than being
gossiped about, and that is not
being gossiped about.” If people
don’t talk about others, it can
signify a kind of social alien-

 Oscar Wilde said,

-‘‘There’s only one

thing Worse than being
gossiped about, and that
is not being gossiped

about. ”

gy — cited by PsychologyToday.
com —— gossip helped early man
navigate the complexities of a
clan and ﬁgure out the relation-
ships that laid therein.

Our brains are also wired to
interpret signs in verbal and

body language to detect one an-

other’s motives and emotions,

and evaluate how to use them to _

our advantage — some scientists
call it Machiavellian intelligence.
Gossip helps forge alliances that

ation. The Caitlyn of the past
— the version of me who spent

A her weekends watching “Sex

and the City” alone and writing
in her feelings journal — hears
that. Invisibility sucks. I
Rarely is gossip malicious —
that takes a kind of Machiavel-
lianism that requires the gossip-
spreader to think he or she is
above the other person or event.
On that note, though, even ma-
licious celebrity gossip — I’m

thinking again, here, of my old
friend Tiger — serves society by
making our humdrum problems
seem a lot more manageable.
Gossiping also serves to human-
ize other individuals, celebrities
or not, in high social positions.
I mean, everybody messes up.-
Everybody bleeds.

All of this reasoning, how-
ever, doesn’t necessarily soothe
you when you realize people at
your job, student organization or
social group are watching you.
One day you walk in and feel like
everybody’s staring at what you
didn’t want to be exposed. You
know, I put on pants today for a
reason. Some things are much
better left to the imagination.

So give the people something
to hold on to. If they care that
much, let their minds wander.
You know what, your life is a
lot more goddamn entertaining
than you ever imagined. Let them
have it. It’s true that dirt can turn
into a mudslide, but it’s possible
to put up reinforcements.

Because people are storytell-
ers naturally, it’s silly to be sur-
prised to find that we haven’t
given up our old ways. In terms
of the evolution of the earth, we
haven’t really been around that
long —— not long enough to grow
out of it, anyway.

Just watch what you say and
watch where you pry. Exposed
nerves can be raw. Spread some-
one’s confidence around, and
the gossip queen who delved too
far will find herself very lonely
indeed, holding only someone
else’s can of worms for com-
pany.

THEATER PREVIEW

 

   

Kuntu Theatre celebrates famedgospel singer

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staff Writer

“Mahaliajackson: Standing on
Holy Ground”

Kuntu Repertory Theatre
Alumni Hall Auditorium

Now through March 12
Tickets: $5 students, $14 fac-
ulty, $20 adults

Tickets can be purchased at the
William Pitt Union boxofﬁce

One of the actresses in Kuntu
Repertory Theatre’s recent show
prepared for her role by keeping
in character at home and recit-
ing lines into a tape recorder to
perfect her delivery. '

Stephanie Akers, who chairs
the group’s steering committee,
plays the role of Aunt Hannah in
“Mahalia Jackson: Standing on
Holy Ground.” The production,
which runs now through March
12, tells the story of famed Gospel
singer Mahalia Jackson and her
impact on the Civil Rights Move-

. l’l'l€IllI.

Akers described Aunt Hannah
as “the nice aunt,” in comparison
to Mahalia’s stricter Aunt Duke.
Akers said that Aunt Hannah is
the one who encouraged Maha-
lia to move from New Orleans
to Chicago to pursue her dream
of becoming a gospel singer.
Terri Smith, an actress in the the-
atre, plays the role of Aunt Duke.
Smith agreed that she portrays
the “strict aunt.” —- the one who
was vocal about not wanting Ma-
halia to go to Chicago. She also

MOVIE REVIEW

said that playing such a stern
character required her to step
out of her element signiﬁcantly
because she is generally not “a
mean person.”

The actress that plays young
Mahalia is 17-year-old Penn Hills
high school student, Imani Wilk-
erson. Twyla Glasgow and Lor-
raine]ackson—Berry play the adult
Mahalia.

All the performers in the show
are local actors and actresses.
There were close to 40 auditions
for the lead role of Mahalia, with
hopefuls ranging. from members
of local choirs to students from
Pitt, Duquesne and CMU. Vernell
Lillie, Kuntu founder and play-
wright, said the selections- were
made based on singing ability as
well as whether the actors and
actresses could commit the neces-
sary time to the play’s production
schedule..

In writing the play, Lillie,
a professor of Black literature
at Pitt, said she wanted to give
people insight into theparts of
the Civil Rights Movement that
aren’t widely known.

“Mahalia wasn’t just a singer
— she played a signiﬁcant role
in Martin Luther King’s March
on Washington,” Lillie said.

She said that ]ackson’s relation-
ship with prominent Chicago
family the Daleys was an integral
part of the march. Her friendship
with them gave her the political
backing of a powerful family that
enabled her to do the march. She
also said that the initial idea for a
March on Washington was found-

I Twyla Glasgow plays the adult Mahaliajackson in Kuntu Repertory T

led by A. Philip Randolph.

“My goal was to bring some of

‘the lesser—known revolutionaries

like A. Philip Randolph and Maha-

liajackson together in such a way

that people could understand the
size of the movement and how all
of these people helped Dr. King,”
Lillie said.

heatre’s production of “Mahalia_]ack-

son: Standing on Holy Ground,” which chronicles the singer’s life.

Lillie also said that the play
shows how an uneducated black
woman from the 9th Ward of New

Orleans was able to become one _

of the most inﬂuential people in
the Civil Rights Movement.

“I wanted to make people real-
ize that it wasn’t only the educat-
ed people who_ were successful,”

Lillie said.

Lillie said thatJackson’s story
is signiﬁcant because she only
sang gospel music, despite receiv-
ing offers to sing in other genres
for more money. She said that,
as a result of _]ack_son’s persever-
ance, gospel music became more

popular. Q ‘ -

‘Rango’ comments on politicians’ thirst for power

Ben Labe
Staﬁ" Writer

‘(Rango)’

Directed by Gore Verbinski
Starring johnny Depp and Isla
Fisher

Grade: A-

A good name is hard to come by.
“Rango” is a good name. It is rug-
ged, penetrating and well—cadenced.
It sometimes even sounds ominous.

Pronouncing it requires the sort of
drawl that one might ﬁnd in Texas
or another state where Spanish and
English collide.

The movie “Rango” is a formula
ﬁlm moonlighting as a postmodern,
existentialist parody. Its plot is one
that’s been explored many times,
yet this ﬁlm manages to be an inter-
esting animated execution. Rango
(Johnny Depp) is the ﬁlm’s feckless
but likeable hero.

After being dropped from the
trunk of a swerving car, the once-

pet lizard ﬁnds himself thrust into '

the middle of the Mojave Desert. The
ﬁrst character he meets is a saga-
cious armadillo (Alfred Molina) who
introduces Rango to the mythology
of the desert. The armadillo then
directs Rango to a town called Dirt
where he might ﬁnd some water.
As a newcomer in town, Rango
feels intimidated by his gruff hosts
and lies ab out his previous life.'Aﬁer
he, accidentally kills a predacious
hawk, the townspeople hail him as
their new hero. The mayor (Ned

Beatty) appoints Rango as the new
sheriff.

For the animals of Dirt, water
is money. Literally. At one point,
the mayor makes the portentous
claim, “If you control the water,
you control everything.” The vault
at the bank, which is just an office
water cooler, is running dry under

the mayor’s watch. But the mayor ‘

is nonchalant. He is a politician who
knows how to use populist rhetoric
against his own people. The movie
incorporates important overtones

about our own society, where our
current economic doldrums are be-
ing used as an excuse for politicians
to again impose suffering on regular
people_while safeguarding the rich,
and powerful.

Later, the banker is found dead
—— murdered by drowning.

The plot of Rango is nothing new,
and the characters are run-of—the-

' mill. But the animals all have memo-

rable traits, and because there are so
many different species, there is a lot

Town awash in water crime

of room for character-speciﬁc jokes.

There’s the pretty girl, a scrupulous lizard
named Beans (Isla Fisher) who becomes suspi-
cious about the drought when she notices that
even though there is no water, the mayor and
his cronies always seem to have some. She
is distrustful of Rango at ﬁrst, seeing him as
the ego-driven klutz that he is. But eventu-

ally she comes around — after all, this movie.

doesn’t deviate very much from predictable
conventions. ’ ,

There is also an innocent, plucky mole
named Priscilla (Abigail Breslin). She is the
sympathetic core of the ﬁlm. In a series of
heartwarming exchanges, Rango comes to
realize that he cannotjlet Priscilla down.‘ As a
cinematic law, we  that he won’t.

The rest of the characters are faint-hearted
but dependable yaho _ l —— most notably a Na~
tiv‘eAmerican raven’aiid"a‘hyperactivelhorned
toad who accompanyikango on his mission to
explain the droughtand a brutish bunch of
louts who act as the mayor’s muscle.

Narration and music are provided by a
Mariachi band composed of owls. Every so
often, the band members predict imminent

   

death and failure for Rango, but they are always
wrong. And it’s hardly a shock that the movie
ends on a positive note. ’

The animation by Nickelodeon Movies is

I superb. It is realistic and stylized at all the

right times, with details as impressive as those
of a Pixar ﬁlm. During certain sequences, the
cinematography is as surreal as a Dali paint-
ing. The portrayal of desert life is witty and
incisive. I .

_ “Rango” works on multiple levels. At times,
it almost seemsto be broken up into scenes

intended for children and scenes intended .

for adults. As in any good family ﬁlm, the ver-
bal jokes are mostly for the adults, and the

slapstick visual humor is "more for the’kids.
Whereas kids will care about the plot and the A

characters, the adults are far moreflikely to

be‘? interested in the ﬁlm’s barragebf movie]

references and existential conﬂicts. The per‘-

‘sona of the Spirit of the Wesltis anobvious and ~ l

hysterical homage that only adults will get. It is
also clear that some of the movie’s most cliché
moments are only there for irony.

Despite having anotherweek of classes, .

many students already have their minds
on Cancun, Cabo San Lucas and other ex-
otic locations. In just a week, these vaca-
tion spots will be packed for spring break
with‘ many travelers arriving by plane.

One of my biggest questions is: What
will these students be wearing for the
ﬂight? v

Over the past several years, I’ve no—.
ticed a shift in what’s considered accept
able plane attire. V

My earliest memory of ﬂying on a

At the young age of 11, I ﬂew with my
mom to our native Eritrea for my uncle’s
summer wedding. The night before, just
as Ifinished packing, I began to set out my
outfit for the eight—hour journey. My first
choice, a casual shorts and T—shirt combo,
was quickly shot down by. my mother.

dressed, I felt mature and sophisticated
beyond my 11 years. Once we had passed
through security, we went in search of
something to eat. As I waited for my pizza,
I noticed something that would make only
an 11—year—old’s eyes widen as much as
mine did. . .

Five feet away from me, a crowd of
girls were swooning over none other than

three memberslof O—Town. I immediately "

headed over. _

Afterward, I was thankful for my pant-
suit andshuddered to think how I would
have approached the boy—banders had
I been wearing‘ my measly shorts and

T-shirt. After I posed for pictures and.

drooled over the band members, my
mother said, “Whether it’s the mall, the

‘airport or school, you never know whom

you might bump into when you leave the
house. Especially in the airport and mall
 your outﬁt will affect the service you
receive.”

Over the last few years, my mother’s
comment has_continued toring true.
To some extent, our attire affects other

people’s perceptions of us. ‘I’ve seen the ,

difference in service in the mall, for ex-
ample.
Over Thanksgiving break, I made two

trips to the same mall. The ﬁrst time, I was .

well-rested, well-dressed and dripping
in labels-. Sales associates were almost

‘ ‘tripping over e_ach other trying to help

me in the hopes of securing a guaranteed
commission. Although I enjoyedthe ser-
vice and "special attention, I didn_’t buy
anything that day. I I .
Later that week, I returned to that sam

spring break in style

mall and the same department stores, ex—
cept this time, I wore sweatpants (don’t
hate me) and Ugg boots (I’m a fraud).

The store clerks’ reception of me was de— .

cidedly different. I’ had trouble finding
someone to help me, and even though I
was prepared to make some sizable plur-
chases,4the sales associates didn’t seem
inclined to help.

The same is generally true when it
comes to any service establishment or
industry, including airports and restau-
rants. In the airport, dressing in a long
black trench coat or baggy sweatpants is a

4 terrible idea. In today’s unstable political
climate, traveling makes people nervous
and even more likely to think of you in a
negative way.

Anywhere you go to exchange money
for some type of service or product, you

A will be judged for the way you dress.
Whether that judgment is good or bad,
it’s sure to affect the manner in which
you’re treated.

Is it fair? Deﬁnitely not. But it’s hu-
man nature, and we’re all guilty of mak-
ing judgmentsof each other based on
appearance and dress. It’s also something
that is out of our control. I’m not one
tocareabout what people think of me
and wouldn’t advise anyone else to care

' either, but I’m well aware of the stigma
associated with dressing sloppily. You
sho_uld'be_too.

So remember as you prepare to take
off towards an exotic locale or when you
go anywhere to receive service: Dressing
just a bit better could lead to an improved
experience.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP

Men, women lose

over the weekend

Nate Barnes, Greg Trietley
~ ’ Staff Report

Despite a furious rally to push the
game to overtime and a game-
high 20 points from senior Gilbert
Brown, No. 6 Pitt (25—4, 13-3 Big
East) came up short against No.
16 Louisville (22-7, 11-5 Big East)
Sunday afternoon, losing 62-59.
After trailing 31-22 at the con-
clusion of the ﬁrst half, the Pan-
thers mounted a comeback to force
overtime with a 56-56 tie at the end
of regulation. The run was capped
off with two perimeter jumpers
by Brad Wanamaker in the closing
minutes, who turned in a strong
game of his. own with 13 points, 12
rebounds and six assists.
Following the tying shots by

Gibbs went 3-for-11 from the ﬁeld,
making two of his three 3-point
attempts.

Throughout the game, the Car-
dinals employed a full-court press
and then transitioned into a 2-3
zone defense, two types of defense
that Pitt has struggled against in
recent contests. Against the zone,
the Panthers had diﬂiculty enter-
ing the ball into the middle and
instead settled for a number of
contested threes.

Pitt ﬁnished 4—for—14 from
3-point range.

For Louisville, Siva scored 14
points to lead the team, with Kyle
Kuric and Mike Marra scoring 12
and 11 points, respectively. Kuric
hit'two shots in overtime, and that
was all the Cardinals needed. Pitt
was held to only three points in

vented a game-winner in regu-
lation by blocking Peyton Siva’s

remaining. McGhee also had 12
rebounds in the contest.

Down three with time winding
down in overtime, Brown missed
an open layup that led to a Lou-
isville fast-break slam dunk with
the clock winding down. In cel-
ebration, a Louisville cheerleader
threw the ball, earning a technical
foul — there were actually 0.5 sec-
onds remaining. '

Gibbs hit both free throws and,
regaining the ball, the Panthers
made a half-court desperation
shot. Itiwas off the mark, and the
miss ended Pitt’s chance to send
the game to doubleovertime.

With two games remaining be-
fore the Big East tourney, Pitt is in
danger of losing its hold on the Big

which it seemed to have locked in
when it- beat Connecticut back in
December. Pitt playsian away game
in Tampa against South Florida (9-

then caps off the season next Satur-
day at home against Villanova.

With their win, Louisville is
now within two games of catch-
ing Pitt for the Big East lead. The

that Pitt has struggled against in recent con-
tests. Against the zone, the Panthers had dif-
ﬁculty entering the ball into the middle and
instead settled for a number of contested
threes.

Pitt ﬁnished 4—for-14 from 3-point range.

For Louisville, Siva scored 14 points to lead
the team, with Kyle Kuric and Mike Marra
scoring 12 and 11 points, respectively. Kuric
hit two shots in overtime, and that was all the
Cardinals needed. Pitt was held to only three
points in the extra time. 4 ‘

With two games remaining before the Big
East tourney, Pitt is in danger of losing its hold
on the Big East regular season championship,
which it seemed to have locked in when it beat
Connecticut back in December. Pitt plays an

‘ away game in Tampa against South Florida
(9-20, 3-13 Big East) on Wednesday, then caps

' off the season next Saturday at home against
Villanova. »

With their win, Louisville is now within two ’

games of catching Pitt for the Big East lead. The
Panthers hang onto a slim one—game lead over
No. 9 Notre Dame (23-5, 12-4) who could pull
within ahalf game of the lead with awintonight
over No. 14 Villanova (21-8, 9-7 Big East). .

AN OLTMANNS’ OPINION

Winners, losers at
NBA trade deadline

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

The NBA trade deadline came and went this
past week, and the landscape of the entire
league changed.

: In fact, it’s being touted as one of the most
active and exciting NBA trade deadlines in
recent memory. V

Star players like Carmelo Anthony and
Deron Williams were shipped from Western
Conference teams to their Eastern counter-
parts, all but cementing the Eastern Confer-
ence as the premier one.

Some teams got better at the deadline,
whereas others made some head—scratching
moves that made one wonder what they were
thinking when they pulled the trigger on the
deal. ,

That being said, here are the winners and
losers from the NBA trade deadline:

Winners:

New York Knicks: At the conclusion of
what had been the biggest storyline in the

V

10-Midnight

.7 5 Tacos 8-1 0

NBA for the past few weeks, the Knicks ﬁnally
landed Brooklyn native Anthony in a trade
with the Denver Nuggets.

Anthony, one of the premier scorers in
the league, averaging just over 25 points per
game, and newly acquired Chauncey Billups
will make the Knicks a real contender. To
make things even better for New York, the
team didn’t give up any elite players to get
’Melo and Billups,

New Jersey Nets: Their owner, Mikhail
Prokhorov, failed to land LeBron James this
summer. Then he lost out on the Carmelo
sweepstakes. But he ﬁnally got his guy when
the Nets acquired point guard Deron Williams
from the Utahjazz. .

Arguably the best point guard in the
league, Williams is averaging over 21 points
and almost 10 assists per game. He brings
star power to a team set to move to Brooklyn
in two seasons. While the Nets traded away
draft picks and‘ a couple good playersto get
“DWill,” they got one of the best players in

the league in return. And in today’s game‘

Celtics, Davis lose out

where stars want to play with other stars,
that matters.

Honorable mentions: Oklahoma City
Thunder, Portland Trail Blazers

Losers:

Boston Celtics: Just when Boston looked
to be the front—runner to emerge from the
Eastern Conference in the playoffs, it traded
away its best big man, Kendrick Perkins, to
the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Celtics re-
ceived Jeff Green in return.iGreen’s a good
player in his own right, but he doesn’t provide
the formidable inside presence that Perkins
does.

Now the Celtics have to rely on the O’Neals
—~ Shaq andjermaine — who are bothon the
last leg of their NBA careers and are nowhere
near the imposing presence they used to be
—— even when they’re healthy enough to be

MCT Campus

in the lineup. On the other end of the spec-
trum, the Thunder got the big man the team
desperately needed and could make a serious
run at a Western Conference title.

Baron Daviszjust a little over a week ago,
Davis could be seen grinning while throwing

‘Los Angeles Clippers teammate Blake Grif-

ﬁn an alley—oop in the slam dunk contest.
Davis seemed to be happy playing for th
Clippers. ~

A Los Angeles native, Davis seemed to
relish his role as a mentor for some of the
best young players in the game. But then he
got the news that no NBA player wants to
hear: He had been traded to the Cleveland
Cavaliers. With the‘Cavaliers lacking LeBron
James and now the worst team in the league,
no one wants to hear he’s been traded to the
team in the Mistake by the Lake.

Honorable mention: Utahjazz I
