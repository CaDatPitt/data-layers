Athletic - Social Events

 

As guests of the University, stu-
dents of the three off ('amDUS C0I1t€1‘S
—-Erie, .loh.nstown, and Uuiontown——,
will participate in an Inter-Center;
Playday, arranged for them by the;
extension department under the di-§
rection of Frank W’. Shock1ey,l
March 11. 

More than 300 students from the;
three branches of the University Willi
join in a.n athletic and social program’,
which.will begin at 2 o'clock ,Saturday~;
:i.l‘ternoon, and brought to a close at;
10 o’clock that evening. 

The Intc-:r—Center Playday will mark;
the ﬂrst time since 1929 that all thel
centers have joint.ly participated in a;
University program. In 1928 students!
from Erie, Johnstown, and Union-'
town were guests on the campus at
the PiI;t.-W.  J. football game, and
the following year attended the Car-'
negie game on the campus. Since that
time, with the exception of the Vio-
xuen’s Plnyday to which Women of the
three centers have been accorded an
invitation to send representatives to
the WAA—\VSGA contests, students of
the off-campus centers have partici-
pated in between S(:h00l,,1)l.‘()gl'anl5
only.

Last year J ohnstown and Uniontowu
arranged a liome-and-home athletic
:m.d social program. Because of the
;.r,rea.t distance, inconvenience and ex-
pense attending the sending ofi
representatives to either of the other
two schools, students from the Erie
branch were forced to decline invi-
tations to participate in programs ar-
rangeil by Johnstown and Uniontown.

Hollis A. Sanderson, physical direc-
tor at Uniontown Center will have
cliarge of the athletic program of the
Playday at Trees_Gym whiclnwill con-
tinue from 2 to 5:80 o'clock." He will
be assisted by students of the phy-

Group Plans
Mock Congress

Event to Consider Problems
of National Importance

 

 

Preliminary plans for a ‘Model
1.”-nited States. Congress were laid re-
cently by John P Bracken, Col. ’3.,
and a small executive committee, in-A‘
eluding John D, Paulus, Col. '34, andl
{Rudolph Morga.n,._,Col. ’34. The Model!
Congress will take place on the;
campus during the later part of;
March, the group announced, and will?
‘be concerned with the outstanding!
problems which President-elect Roose-l
veltfs special session will consider. 3

The third in a series of similar!
events, the Model Congress will at-i
tract University students who are in-E
tr-.rested in national political problems!
of importance. A number of eventsi
are being, arranged and tentative out-_i
lines have been suggested for tliel
consideration of the Congress. '

The event will resemble last year's»;
Model Political Convention inasmuch}
as several committees will be ap-l
pointed to consider thoroughly prob-
lems of importance such as foreign
debts, international relations, reclam-
-_ation, economic planning, and others.
The reports of the conimittees will
be oft'erc»d at the ﬁnal sessioli of the
a1”t‘air where, after discussion, the re-
ports will either be adopted or re-
ejected.
_ Several innovations in the proce-
dure oi the Congress will be noticed
in the coming event- All students who
take part in the affair will be asked

-, to present their requests to the exec-.

lutive committee of the Congress
which will pass on the eligibility of
lstudentsv qualiﬁed to take part.

The. group is negotiating to bring
;several outstanding senators, repre-
‘sentati-ves, or. other local leaders in
.government to address the delegates.
The personnel of the executive com-
mittee will be named in the immedi-
ate future and plans for the Congress
will be developed,

“The present popularity of the
racket and crime ﬁlm should not
be deplored,” says Dr. Francis D.
Tyson, professor of economics.
“These pictures represent, he
continues, for the most part, a
real eifort to get away from the
defensive reactions of ignorance.
We need the vital aid of the mov-

against crime, and it must be

used to present fully the complex
of human motives and the distor-
tions of life that lie back of crim-
inal conduct."

exception of the three-mile event set
by Corbett in 1925 in 15:-19.2 which
will go uncontested‘.

In all there will be 25 events, theg
varsity squad participate in twelve
regular events, the fresh in eleven. An
open race in both the henior and jun-
ior card at the close of the program
will be a, hop, skip, and jump event.

The direct results of the indoor
track meet tomorrow afternoon will
be to "choose a relay to represent the
University at the IC-l——A indoor,
planned for Madison Square Garden
in New York City next Saturday even-
ing, and to award red, white, and blue
ribbons for place winners in various
events on the varsity and frosh card.
The indirect results will include 8.
study on what may be expected from
the 1933 track team this year against
Notre Dame, Temple, Penn State. and
Carnegie Tech.

Blue ribbons will be a-Warded to
ﬁrst; place winners, with red ribbons
{or the second best, and white for
third place takers. 3

Keller, Schlossberg, Milligan, Flem-I
ing, and Kiger will provide the main!
opposition in the shorter dash events;
[for the varsity. Keller, a junior, is;
serving his second‘ term on the var-l
sity squad, and majors in the 220 and:
quarter mile events. The others,}
graduates from last. year's frosh:
squad, will be participating in their‘?
second varsity interccollegiate event,!
the first -being the invitation indoor atl
llflorguntown two weeks ago, when!
the Panthers trackmen scored morel
than 25 points to take second place
in competition.

In the longer runs Lawrence, Clise,
‘wagenliouser, l{irkpa.trick_. Galan,
Christrnan. and McDonald will do the
running, with the odds favoring none.

Tho only departments giving
Coach Olson trouble are the pole
vault and high and low hurdles. Theis-
sen is the only regular in the low and
high hurdles events, Miller, Simms.
-Sebastian, Rookcr have not been test-
ed and their quality is yet an unde-
termined quantity. In the pole vault

Olson is concentrating on O'Dell,
(“..rocke1', Ericsson, Gongloif and
Pelucha.

In the weight events there will be
plenty of opposition with Bonavita,
Gonglofl‘, Yalenti, Wilkins, and Self-
fcrt furnishing the throwing power.

Should the meet prove a successful
one tomorrow, Coach Olson may at-
tempt to runoff an interfraternity
event some time the latter part of‘;
next month. The last recorded record '
in an indoor interfraternity event was
made in 1928. There have been no
fraternity events, other than the
-spring track meet since that time.

l Pitt/s ﬂrst wrestling team since
i 1917, when wrestling was discontinued

{as part of the official intercollegiate
 athletic program, will meet the
 Sewickley YMCA grapplers at Sewick-
 ley next W'edne-sday night in its ﬁrst
1 competition. The first intercollegiate
lmatch will be with the \Vaynesburg
; College team at Waynesburg. on
; March 10.

,‘ The Pitt. wrestlers have been work-
l ing out da.lly for several weeks under
lthe direction 01' Harold A._ Hubler,
lformer Penn State star. Hubler is a
E graduate student in the University.
j Vvhile at State College he represented
 the Lions in the 135-pound class. Un-
ldefeated for two years in dual com-
: petition, he won the Eastern intercol-
' legiate championship in 1930.

Hubler has a big job in rounding
out a team, as most of his men are
inexperienced and the University as
yet has no adequate facilities for the
sport, Despite these handicaps, Hub-
ler has hopes for a good squad.

The athletic department is negoti-
ating for two additional meets, one
with the Akron Y a.t_Akron, Ohio, and
a. joint meet with the Western Rye-'
serve and Penn State varsity teams
on March 25.

The team to represent Pitt willgbe
picked from the following men in the
118 pound class, R.Thiessen. Robert
Boyd; in the 126 pound class, Jack
Gleason, Paul I-Iinclibergei‘, Willia.m

Boxers Prep
For Middies

Pitt Mittmen Stage Extensive
Drills For Navy Bouts

 

Any attempt to break a long losing
streak is greeted with cheers by the
assembled thousands, but for some
,reason or other, there are not many
for‘ the cheerers who expect the Pitt
boxers to break into the winner's
column tomorrow night. The reason

gfor this is the fact that the Pitt box- !

ers are stacking. up against the Navy
mittmen. ‘
l" After a. good start, in which they

defeated the Temple boxers, Eastern
lConference champions, the Panthers
went into reverse, and were defeated
_by West Virginia, Army, and Du-
quesue in succession. The fact that
the Tech matches were postponed
‘have given the Panther boxers a new
‘ambition to ﬁght, and they appear to
‘be in the best of shape for tomor-
- row’s match.
1 Navy. under the able tutelage of
"‘Spike” Webb, has been on the win-
ning side of the fence for so long,
that it seems almost an impossibility
for the Pitt boxers to turn in :1 vic-
tory. However, Coach Orsini, is some-
what optimistic on the result, and the
rest will be up to the boxers them-
selves. ‘

and the matter of naming their start-
ing lineup is mostly a matter of guess
work. Every report that has come
from the Navy publicity oflice seems
to point to the fact that _a new squad
is picked each day, but what becomes
of the former squad, no one seems to
know.

\Vright will likely -box in the 115-
pound class for Navy, and will prob-
able be followed; by Dolan or Suther-
land in the 125-pound class. The
lightweight and gwelterweight classes
will be capably ﬁlled by Miller and
Nauman, respectively. McNaughton
seems to be the logical Middle start-
er in the 155-pound class, with Lam-

PAGE THREE

can be said as yet of the Navy 165-

pounder.

No change will be made in the Pitt
lineup for this match, which means
that Junge will ﬁght at 115 pounds:
Gambatese at 125 pounds; Giannatti
at 135 pounds; Spiegel at 145 pounds;
Schricker at 155 pounds; Captain
Seigel at 165 pounds; Kopp at 175
pounds.

The squad will leave Pittsburgh to-
night and will enter the ring at An-
napolis at 8:00 o'clock Saturday
night.

In Need at Recognition

SIX YEARS ago the ﬁrst oﬁ?-campus branch of the University was
ization of two similar branches at Uniontown and Eric. Much time,
cﬁort, and expense on the part of the University attended the estab-
lishment of the three centers: s1n'vcys to centralize the greatest num-
ber of high school graduates who might beneﬁt from attenda.ncc at
a University branch rather than come direct to the campus for the
freshman and sophomore years were conducted; provisions for best
available class quarters made; and the best available tcacliiug staff
provided those who wished to take advantage of this educational
venture. Too, in order that these students wl1o attended eithcr—E1-ic,
J ohnstown, and Uniontown miglit realize the full benefit of Univer-
sity training, the calling of these branches Junior Colleges was con-
sored. Thcy were just as much a part of the campus as the campus
itself. They were University Ccntcrs.

Over these six years, to the students on the campus, students
attending either of the three Centers were University; students in
name only. There has been little or no recognition of these students
who become a part of the campus organization during their junior
and senior years. They are as strangers in the fold, visitors hearing
strange earmark.

‘What becomes of the student, appearing for the ﬁrst time on the
campus in his or her junior year, prominent as a. student and as a
leader of activities while at one of the three off-campus centers? A
stranger, he bccom one of the thousands of milling students knock-
ing at the doors of Education, his identity completely lost in the
maze of new contacts, having had no opportunity, unless extremely
fortunate to have had previous contact with a few friends before
him on the campus, to become acclimated to the ways of the campus
until so much time has been lost that it becomes an almost impossi-
bility to make his mark on the campus.

L-ctliargic attempts have been made in the past to initiate the
oﬁ-ccntcr student into the fraternity of the campus. On two occa-
sions during the life of the three centers, students have been invited
to spend a day on the campus, but at their own expense. They were
not guests, just paying visitors.

The fault of this caste condition lies both with the student of
the campus as well as the student of the center. Rcbuffed by lack
of welcoming advance on the part of the student of the campus, the
student from either of the oﬂ’.-campus centers not ﬁnding a satisfac-
tory answer to his “What’s it all worth?” question goes mumbling
through his two years on the campus of the injustice of treatment
and lack of friendly spirit. On the other hand, the students of the
centers seem to enjoy an isolated life while attending the off-canipus
branches, ignoring a kindly invitation to participate as an off-campus
branch of the campus fraternity. The result is a growing spirit of
alicnity which tlnrcatcns the coming of the Centers’ students to the
campus. They did not know, and now they begin n.ot to care. '

The centralization of Center activities into a cohesive and con-
solidated group takes a step in the right direction, in the planning
of an Inter-Center playday. Here will be a splendid opportunity of
seeing what the other half looks like, and becoming a part of it, of
making contacts with the inner circle and proﬁting by those con-
tacts, of losing a great part of the cloak of strangeness which has
destroyed the initiative of the off-campus student to earn an interest
on his off-campus talents: for the campus student it will be an op-
portunity of learning just what sort of quality there is in the
branches of the University.

Bethany Religious Forum
Attracts Pitt Delegation

 

established in J ohnstown, followed, the next year with the organ- ’

Sugar-coated religion will be in or-
der next week when several Pitt men
and women participate in the West-
ern Pennsylvania-West Virginia In-
tercollegiate Conference on Religion
at Bethany College, starting Friday
and ending Sunday.

Not only are religious questions to ,
the conference will attempt to give

be probed, but the conference is to
progress through a series of recep-
tions, luncheons, dances and athletics.

As highlights of the conference, the
Bethany College orchestra. is to play
at dinner meetings; special orienta-
tion sessions are to be held, and
swimming and hiking programs have
been arranged. What promises to be
the high water mark of the confer-
ence is a special U-table forum, at
which friendly and unfriendly expo-
nents of religion are to engage in
battle. ‘

“The central purpose of this con-
ference,” according to .3. printed pro-
gram of the convention, “is to help
students find and know the way out
of our personal
sions.”

Dr. Henry P. Van Dusen, dean at
Union Theological Seminary, and
Miss Winifred Wygal, of the student
division staff of the National Board

and social confu-_

of Young Womenls Christian Associa-
tion, are to lead the discussion
forums. Dr. Van Duseu will speak at
foundiﬁerent sessions, once Friday
evening, once Saturday morning, once
Saturday night, and once Sunday
morning.

His series of a.ddresses throughout

a religious and philosophical back-
ground for the recovery of unity and
Durpose in personal and social situa-
tions. No pre-determined topics have
been assigned to these addresses, the
content being modiﬁed to meet the
problems of the students as they
arise.

Conference delegates will be the
guests of the student body of Bethany
College. Everyone is to be accom-
modated in either dormitories, or fra-
ternity aud sorority houses, so that
the only expense involved is for
transportation and for meals.

Two Pitt students, Marjorie Hanson
and Rudolph Morgan,.both Col. ’34,
are representedon the general con-
ference committee. Miss Helen Bat-
trick. executive secretary of the Pitt
YWCA, is to cooperate, and Mr. W.
W. Mendenhall, executive secretary
of the Pitt YMCA, will act as con-
ference secretary.

Editor of The Pitt News:
Dear Sir: «

We, the Junior Prom Committee,
wish to express our feelings toward
the Pitt News, a supposedly repre-
sentative University newspaper, for
the adverse comment in its columns
concerning the Junior Prom. VVc
feel that we have a perfect right to
so express these feelings, since we
put over one of the most successful
dances ever held at Pitt, both ﬁnan-
cially and socially.

The committee concurs in the opiu-
ion that the most unfair treatment
was given us through your editorial
policy. Among other things, the
News failed to put a final writeup
about the dance on page one on the
day of the dance, and instead placed
a very brief resume on page two.
This, we believe, is an unprecedented
policy in dealing with a dance as im-
portant ou the campus as the Junior
Prom, and is not one that assures
the good-will of the student body to-
ward the News.

However, be that as it may, we
might even thank you! Your editorial

comment "causcd'us to work all the '

harder to make the dance succeed.
And in spite of the odds against us,
we DID succeed, and the dance was
a. success! Tliat old phrase might
well be applicable here, “It's an ill
wind that blows no one good!”

It is the com1nit.tcc"s advice that in
the future you boost dances and give
them the proper and fair advertising
that is necessary to assure their suc-
cess. not condemn them before they
are held!

Sincerely,
The Junior Prom Committee.

Editors of T-he Pitt News.

'l‘hcrc is a famous and very old joke
which has been making the rounds of
the college l1lllll0I'0llS Inagazines for
a good many years. It reads about
as follows:

“Hey, Frosh, you cz1n’t use this
walk!”

“Can't hub? Vvliy not?”

“Because, dumb. by order of the
1'-Iokum College Student Council it
became a tradition at twelve o'clock
today that only Seniors can use this
walk.”

It sems evident that the Pitt Stu-
dent Council in creating a Traditions
Committee is in favor of this “tradi-
tion by decree” theory. According to
the Pitt News for Friday, February
10, the 'l‘1'a.d.itions Committee was or-
ganized for three purposes: to deter-
mine longstanding University tradi-
tions and to keep them as such; to
uncover new and appropriate customs,
and to act as a standing committee
for the interpretation of traditions,
It is plain that Council has never
bothered to look up the deﬁnition for
“tradition” in the dictionary. For
their information, I quote from a good
authority:

“Tradition—-the oral transmission
of events, opinions, doctrines, prac-
tices, etc,, through successive gener-
ations without written memorials;
that which is so handed down, ancient
custom.”

For instance, it is a. tradition that
the president of the United States
should not serve more than two terms,
audit is a. tradition that the Pitt
mascot and sym-bol‘ "is a panther.
There is no law requiring these
things.

But surely it is obvious that a Tra-
ditions Committee is a. gilding of the
lily, a foolish superﬂuity, more likely
to bring about the end of many of the
traditions Pitt may now have, and im-
potent in,its avowed purpose of ore-
ating new customs. A codification, a
writing down and making into law of
traditions causes them to cease being
traditions. From that time on, they
become just so many laws to be
broken and twisted to suit popular
convenience. The beauty of a. tradi-
tion is entirely in its spontaneity--its
popular acceptance without compul-
sion. But there is nothing good about
a. tradition as such. Most of them are
outmoded today. Why’ should a. com-
mittee be appointed to insist upon the
perpetuation of many so—called tradi-
tions that have long lost any real vi-
tality, use, and purpose? The divine
riglit of kings was a good tradition
until a few kings tried to abuse their
power in the face of an enlightened
public oninion.

Equally, it is impossible to uncover
new customs. There is no such thing
as a “new” custom. A custom, to be-
come a custom, must be habitual.
This year's Council can force the ini-
tiation of acts which it may hope will
eventually become customs, but it
cannot decree “new customs.” It was
the custom to consider the Junior
Prom the biggest, most important
dance until the Military Ball won that
honor. -

Yale has a. fence, Stanford has an
axe, Harvard has an accent. Let Pitt
take pride in the fact that most Pitt
students have sense enough not to
waste their time and energy in dig-
ging up a lot of old customs that are
better left dead. Any effort to sell
“new” customs and traditions to Pitt
students will probably meet the disre-
gard it deserves.

too many traditions being blindly fol-
lowed by too many people now. Stu-
dent Council would do better if it ap-
pointed the ten students who now
comprise the Traditions Committee
to a Committee for Pitt Progress,

 Sdeahers
Are Problems
For YMCA

“Do you walk to school, or do
you carry your lunch?” And
over 100 members of the YMCA
luncheon clubs shouted in unison,
“Both!"

The occasions were several
meetin:_:s of the Monday, Tues-
day, Wednesday, and Thursday
lunch forums. “Bill” l\lc-ndenhall,
executive secretary, noticed that
membership was falling off. At
each meeting there were fewer
and fewer to listen to prominent
economists, business men, and
political scientists speak on their
pet theories and cure-alls for
everytliing that's wrong.

So Bill decided to get to the
bottom of it all. Concerning for-
mer members who were making
themselves scarce, he put the
question to them, “Say, why have
you stopped coming around? The
boys want to see you!”

In practically every
the answer was the same. “Well,
Bill, there's a depression, and
thereby hangs my confession.”
‘What to do about it? The solu-
tion arrived at by Mr. Mendenhall
and his associates was very sim-
ple.

If a. fellow doesn't want to pay
two .bits_fo1' a couplcgof bites of
cafeteria food, they reasoned. let
him bring his own lunch. Food
ever have thought of that?

Now, the attendance is nearly
100 per cent. Every chair around
the table in room 3 at the Y but
is taken. Everybody eats_ Every-
body’s happy!
