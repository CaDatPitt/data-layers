An effort is underway at Pitt"to 
.win collective bargaining for faculty--:3
members. The Pitt Professional :
Union (PPU) has announced the--
launching of a card drive to getvi-_;
faculty signatures authorizing the"
PPU as their bargaining agent. - ' ; 

According to Dr. Philip Wion, 3.
associate professor of English and
president of the PPU, the Pennsyl-
Vania Labor Relations Board needs:
30 percent of thefaculty to sign the
cards in order to mandate an elec‘-.
tion, but his- organization is hoping ‘I
for a much higher percentage to
strengthen their case. N ' _ _ _i

The organization effort stems
from two basic issues:. salary and
fringe benefits, and the problem of
the faculty’s limited role in setting
university priorities and policy.\- 

According to Wion, the average’
realincome of a Pitt faculty m_einb'e_r
has declined 20 percentover thelast
‘ten years. P ' r M’

ciate professor at Pitt makes "less

i"N:riiona|ity Roomswill Award ’   
l6Sd1oiarshipsforPitt Students

By COLLEEN MCDONAIID
"‘._._"'-;'Pitt News Staff Writer‘'‘—--:——‘’

Looking for something interest;

ing /and worthwhile to do over the
Christmas holidays? Start thinking
about 1981 summer study abroad.
The Nationality Rooms and lnter-
cultural Exchange, Programs will
‘award 16 scholarships next Feb-
ruary for deserving graduate and
undergraduate Pitt students.
Applications for the scholarships
are now available in Room 361
Mervis Hall.

‘ ‘We have been awarding grants

iforlsummer study abroad since

1948,” said Maxine Bruhns,
Nationality Rooms Program direc-
tor. “The program, now in its 32nd

.. year, has given 259 scholarships

amounting to over $210,000.”

Applicants must have at least a
2.75 quality-point average, have
been registered for two consecutive
terms (about 60-90 credits by April,
1981) and must return in Septem-
ber for at least ,two consecutive
terms, said Bruhn_s.

There are two parts to the
application, said Marilyn Gindroz,
from the executive office of the
program; the first two pages are an
initial screening. Students then
arrange apreliminary interview and
receive the "second part of the
application which includes study
abroad objectives and faculty and
personal .references,. Gindroz
added.

‘ “It is best for students to come in
now and look through the mater-
ials. This way they can get advise

A on the best programs to ﬁt their

1!

individual goals, said" Gindroz.

The Nationality Program office
has catalogues from a number of
foreign universities and American
programs that offer foreign sum-
mer studies, she said.

“If students come in early

T enough, they can write for more

 

 

     
  

information,” Gindroz said.

 -‘

According to Bruhns, eligible J‘
,5{///.,.

graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents can apply for two scholar-
ships but can only be awarded one.
She said that no more than six
ﬁnalists are chosen for each
scholarship.

“Finalists are then reviewed by a
five-person panel consisting of
representatives from the National-
ity Room Committees and faculty,”
said Bruhns. “The ﬁnal interviews
are spontaneous and unstructured.”

The program was founded by
Ruth Crawford Mitchell, a distin-
guished international educator and
member of the Nationality Room
Council. Mitchell organized -the
committees and the construction of
the rooms, said Bruhns.,

“This year in honor of her 90th
birthdray, the program is offering
the Ruth Crawford Mitchell‘Award,
a one-time graduate award for
study abroad,” Bruhns added.

Also new this year is the John H.
Tsui Memorial Award for graduate
study of Chinese culture. Tsui,
explains Bruhns, became chairman
of the Chinese Room in the 1930’s
and was instrumental in getting the

Bill Abraham, recently re-elected
for a second term as SGB President,
said in an interview that two of his
first priorities are greater visibility
for the SGB and the allocations
process.

“We‘ll be opening things up more
this year, having planning sessions
and open forums with the student
body,“ Abraham said.

“We’re hoping for a great deal of

student participation.” he added.
Abraham said that the Board may

publish a newsletter to keep the stu-
dent body up-to-date on what the
Board is doing.

A second item that is high on
Abraham's priorities is the alloca-
tions process which will begin in
January. The allocations process is
the process by which student organi-

. zations are budgeted for the coming
year.

Abraham said there will be joint
meetings between the Allocations
Committee and the new Board
members to acquaint them with the
allocations process.

“We need to add a degree of con-

decisions that are made regarding

policy and funding priorities. As it
stands, the faculty has a variety of
apparatus in place to present their
views, but “in reality, we are more
often on the reaction end ofa policy
than on the language end," Wion
said.

Professor Van Beck Hall, former
president of PPU believes that col-
Iective bargaining would cause the

_ university to be more public about

the decisions it makes about using
taxpayers’ money. .

“Pitt has a bigger budget than the
City of Pittsburgh and everything
the city does is open to inspection.
When Pitt says it doesn’t have the
money for the Women’s Center, or
Hillman Library, we have a hard
time believing them since we'don’t
have access to the information on
which those decisions were based,”

Hall said.

The last organization drive at Pitt
was in 1976. At that timethe faculty
voted in favor of collective bargain-

mg but, because of the number of
groups competing for the position of
bargaining agent, the vote was split
between the American Association
of University Professors, the
National Education Association,
the PPU, and a “no agent" choice,
and no one received a majority.

This time around, the PPU, is
seeking and alliance with the AAUP,
and feels that their position has been
strengthened by the continued dete-
rioration of the average faculty
members position.

The PPU hopes to hear from a
significant number of faculty
members by early winter. Their goal
is to present the results of the card
drive’ to the State Labor Relations
Board by summer, hold an election
by early fall and, if that goes well, to
enter into contract negotiations with
the University by this time next year.

The PPU is directing its drive
towards faculty in the provost’s
area. This includes the Faculty of
Arts-and Sciences, the School of

“We’ve stressed teamwork in,t_he_'

take a little," he said. A ,_

“I hope everyone will work If ,

Dreainer Cheated of His 
To nﬂtethewrlda Bit Better

By LARRY‘ LUNSFORD

Imagine there's no Heaven

it's easy ifyou try

no he/I below us

Above us only sky. ,
Imagine all the people living for today.

How ironic to look “back and
reflect upon these words of John
Lennon written in 1971. The world

with which Lennon _was so‘
displeased, the world ﬁlled with
hatred which he so wantedito ﬁll
with peace, has made the famous
Beatle one of its victims.

This is the second time within.

four years that the music industry ‘

and the world has been shocked by
the tragic loss of one of the most

prominent membersiin the history .

of thebusiness. The reaction to the
death of Lennon may even surpass
that which'was expressed by the
unexpected death of Elvis’ Presley
on August 16, 1977. ' "‘

Regardless of thecontroversythat
has surrounded..:e..the..ﬁg es since,
their rise from a lowly'iBr1tish pub in
the early sixties, it is doubtful that
anyone can question the’ major

impact that the quartet played in the
music industry as well as on societal
and cultural trends themselves. The
arrival of the Beatles sounded the
death knell for the rock-and-roll era
particular to the fifties, and ushered
in a new form of rock-aiid-roll which
created the heat generation. Individ-
uality was the key to that generation.
New dress, new language, and new
morals all highlighted by the use of
durgs identified the new generation
whose lifestyles and stories were told
in their music. -

Along with the assassination of

Beatle things, 1 recently found a

Many people support the United

Nations hoping thus to better the
world. My contention. is that they
must now begin to prepare for the
next step which is a world govern-
ment under constitutional law,
agreed to byall nations, with a world
court to which all "international .
problems must be taken, and whose
edicts can be enforced byan interna-:
tional police force; This the United-
Nations cannot .do, not being a *
government, though it has been and
will be, of the greatest value until
such an international government
can take its place. i

but the only alternative to war is the
ruleof law.

Since modern technology has
drawn the countries of the world
into a single, global community, that
community must-be governed not by.
some self-serving interest, but by a
world government under constitu-

__ tional law if we are ever to achieve a
lasting peace.

Our present , efforts toward a
peace seem, to me, impractical. We

tant future, but I want the killing
and misery stopped before that.
Also, it is impractical to expect
the responsible leaders of any nation
to expose its citizens to attack from
other nations. Even a reduction of
armaments is a very “chancy”thing.
Remember the agreement not to use
poison gas in , World War I? It
worked only until the crunch came.
Furthermore, when we, as paciﬁsts,
ask our nation to disarm, or limit
armaments, are we being fair to all
the non-pacifists (who have an equal
right to their belief0 when we ask
them to give up their only protec-
tion? We don’t even tell them how
disarmament can be safely accomp-
lished. We may be willing to be
martyrs to the cause, but we are ask-
ing them to be victims of our belief.
Again I ask, is it fair? Also, any
successful peace-plan must be able to
control, and direct‘ into acceptable

V channels, the violent element latent

  John Lennon- ‘I Heardfl1eI\IeiwsToday§

By SAM MATTIJ-IEWS

“I could have been ‘
f——-————- fisherman,” began
John Lennon in Lennon Remem-
bers. And he could have‘, too. He
could’ have been whatever he
wanted. An artist. A writer._ A poet.
An actor. John Lennon was allof
these things. Instead, he chose
rock and roll; the only livingiart
"form in the 20th century that allows
the’artist’s statement to have some
impact.

Lennon was my fave  .
Wheras Paul was cu?, __, _' 
musician, Ringo a. hired-hand,

E Lennon ‘was an idealist. An
experimental artist in the truest
sense. He took risks. He made
statements. He had a social
consciousness.

Perhaps Lennon’s greatest
achievement_was his use of rock
and roll as a vehicle for social
change. In the late 60’s and early

John_ and Yoko led a

two-person campaign for peace in
the’ world. It was publicity stunts
and full-page ads in" international
newspapers appealing for peace on,

«- earth. Look at their songs.’ The\

refrains tell the story. Give peace a
chance, they chanted. Or Power to
the people. Many American youths
who. never exercised their consti-
tutional rights to qgestion the
United States policy on the
Vietnam.War now had the issue
‘thrown in their faces by their
transistor radio. You couldn’t
escape or ignore their message.
As the Beatles split and the war
ended, Lennon began his long ﬁght
with the U.S. Government to allow
him to immigrate to this country.
During" this period Lennon re-
corded all but one of his
post-Beatles work. His 'ﬁrst ‘album’

,,__with the Plastic Ono Band is his

best aitd. probably the most
horrifying. Lennon used this music
to exorcise his own demons by the.
primal therapy of J anov. Although
the song’ meanings are personal,
these recordings are the most‘
intense of his solo work. Use

was born, the U.S. Immigration
Service ﬁnally came through with
the citizenshipfor Lennon that they
had previously deniedi.’ At this
point Lennon retired to take care of ‘
his son. Finally, this summer saw
the long-awaited recording and
release of Double Fantasy. A
world-tour ‘was in the V works.
Lennon was talking to the press
explaining the changes within him. .-
Then, Monday night, Lennon diesa
of gunshot wounds at age 40.

_ During lunch Tuesday at Roy '

__;.-,...;'-___~.,; in Oakland, I overheard
two middle-aged women speaking

of Lennon. One said, “Why. are
people making such a big thing of
this? People get shot every day.”

, Perhaps the tragic death of Lennon /
. can't be fully appreciated by those

who can remember a time before
the Beatles. As long as. I have been
following rock arid roll the Beatles
were ‘a constant. From my first .
memory of them on Ed Sullivan 'to
Lennon’s latest LP, the Beatles, "
and particularly the outspoken
John Lennon, -provided me with a
role model of sorts and _a code of

Pantheisbefeat

— By AMIN GHOSSEIN—_

Pitt News Sports Writer
For 30 minutes the question was
not -how much Pitt would win by but
whether they would indeed win at
all. It was only in the final l0 min-
' utes that the blowout that had been
expected materialized in the form of
a 79-64 win. I
Against Indiana of Pa., a division
ll school, the Panthers were not sup-
posed tobe tested. There were, how-
ever, external factors that made it
tough for the Panthers to concen-
trate on the game. In the wake of the
withdrawal of Brett Crawford, a
, promising freshman, came the sur-
prise announcement that Lennie
McMillan and Eddie Wallace were
suspended for an indefinite amount
of time. Couple that with a disap-
pointing trip to Missouri and it is
easy to see why the Panthers were
not playing up to par. Ofcourse,

IUP was not going to lie down and .

make it easy for the Panthers either.
The Panthers had to work for their
win. '

Indiana took a quick 4-0 lead
before Dwayne Wallace could break
the ice for Pitt with a 12-foot
jumper. The game remained close
throughout the first half with the
biggest lead for either team being
Pitt’s nine point lead at 4:22 of the
first half. With Pitt leading 35-26
the Indians, on the strength of the
hot shooting of Jeff Brown, were
able to cut the halftime lead to a
precarious four points at 40-36.

Brown, who led IUP with 20
points, impressed most everyone
and had people asking why was he
playing for a division ll ballclub.
Carloton Neverson and Clyde
Vaughn both agreed that Brown
could play for a division I school. It
was his play that was mostly respon-
sible for lUP’s strong showing. /

With McMillan out the Panthers
lose one of their better defenders,
and, in th_e“opinion of coach Chip-
man this was a key.

“Lennie is an outstanding defen-
sive player while Clyde is a good one
but he still has a lot to learn,” said
Chipman. “lt’s tough to lose a
player of McMillan’s caliber and not
have it affect the cohesivenessiof the
defense."

Although Clyde Vaughn may still
have a lot to learn on defense, his
offense makes it easy to see why
Chipman has so much confidence in
the freshman from New Rochelle

The Panther Swimmers were
_ defeated Thursday at home, 69-45
by the North Cardlina State Wolf-
pack coached by Don Easterliﬁg.
Pitt's head coach Fred Lewis said he
was disappointed by the loss, not
‘ because Pitt swam poorly, but
because N.C. State toughed out the
Panther swimmers by less than one
second in four out ofthe eight swim-
ming events they won.,One of these
four events was the first event ofthe
meet, the 400 Medley Relay. Pitt lost
this event by fourteen-hundredths of
a second, but second place in a relay
is as good as last, since only first
place in relays gets points.

One must look deep r than just
the score. into Pitt‘/s p rformance.

High. Promoted to a starting posi-
tion, Vaughn answered with l8
points; l4ofthose cominginthe first
half. By his own admission, Vaughn
is more comfortable as a starter.
“As a 6th man I had a lot of pres-
sure on me to score but now as a
starter I can relax more and take my
shots,” said Vaughn. “As you can
see by today, I had a real good
shooting dav.” ._
Dubbed as a‘ mini-Clancy,
Vaughn and “big, brother" Clancy
were the only players for Pitt in dou-
ble figures at halftime.’ Clancy com-
plemented Vaughn’s 14 points with
I0 of his own. The scoring burden
fell upon these two powerful for-
wards because Neverson and Wal-
lace were having an off shooting

7 points at halftime.

the only Panthers who had their
troubles. The entire Pitt team shota
miserable 37% from the field while
the Indians shot 62%. Coach Chip-
man is miffed at the Panthers shoot-
ing slump.

“After the St. Bonaventure game
we shot the ball real well. But after
that wcjust have not been able to put
the ball in the hoop. I can’t explain
it,” said Chipman.

The first l0 minutes ofthe second‘
half, was a replay of the first half.
The teams stayed close to each other
and with l0 minutes left to play the
score was still a close 60-57 with.Pitt
out in front. With the game in
danger of becoming an upset, Carl-
ton Neverson found his shooting
touch and keyed the Pitt win. 7

Neverson scored 8 of his l2 points
in the final ten minutes. He began
with a 6 foot jumper to make it 62-
57. After a Steve‘ Beatty field goal,
Neverson scored another one from
l'0 feet out. The senior from New
York then stole the ‘ ball and fed
Dwayne Wallace for an easy. two,
and within three minutes the score
was 68-58. Neverson was notdqne“
however, as he scored two ‘more
buckets sandwiched in between a
Sam Clancy dunk.

‘ Coach Chipman called the victory

, a tough psychological game.

“Everybody is pressing,” said the
Panther coach. “With the two kids
being suspended and that tourna-
ment really hurt the kids, this game
was tough. But they won and I feel
pretty good about that. I'll give

them the day off tomorrow and I

think they need that. Butiafter that

and two second places, improved‘

Pidgeon» and Jerry Zaleski also
improved on all their times. Long
distance swimmer, Mike Polak,
dropped seven seconds off his 100-
yard freestyle time and five seconds
off his 500-free time.

“I see improvement every time the
men swim," said Lewis, “We're
further ahead than last year and
right on schedule for nationals.”

Lewis also expressed pleasure by
his freshmen showing their power.
“Just look at the first event-. We had
three freshmen, Geoff Emore, John
Waldman, and Mike Lehto, and one
junior, Ricky Carter, nearly beat a"
relay team from NC. State with a

former UCLA coach Gene Bartow.

Pitt will have to play much better

Lewis..

did. Greenwell executed dives with

dence and poise that commands
respect‘ in diving competitions

The Women’s lnvitational Bas-
ketball Tournament this past week-
end turned out to be an offensive
show, with the winning team in l l of
the l2 games scoring over 75 points.
Three teams, Penn State, Youngs_-.
towri State, . . and West Virginia,
topped the century mark. Not until
the championship game, pitting the
Pantherettes’ against the 7th-ranked
Lady Wolves ofCheyney State, were
the defenses relied upon.

Although Pitt’s defense sparkled,

{Kim/inning the statistical battle, the

offense sputtered. Cheyney State
was crowned the l980 tournament
champion, defeating the now 4-2
Pantherettes, 65-55. Despite the
score, Pitt had just about everything
going for them the entire game.
Cheyney took the.opening jump
ball, but could do nothing with it.
The Pantherettes fared no better
when they headed for their end of
the floor, as it was apparent that
both teams were still suffering from

' the pre-game jitters the first two

minutes into the game. The Pan-
therettes dominated the boards and
it began to pay off. With Cheyney’s
offense checked, Pitt relaxed and
their shots began to swish the nets.

Pam Miklasevich popped -in the first
two points, and Debbie Lewis
quickly followed suit. A deft pass to
Gail Aughburns at the back door
resulted in Pitt’s third basket in one
minute, and the Pantherettes
jumped out to a 6-0 lead. The Lady
Wolves regrouped, however, and
gnawed away at the lead.

Cheyney went on top with 6:18
remaining in the half, 24-22. With
Freda Glover and Valerie Walker
hot, the _Lady Wolves never relin-
guished that lead. Not helping the
cause was the Pantherettes inability
to sink a layup, which theyihadiai
chance to do five times in the final
five minutes. Pitt also could not

score on three one-and-one situa-

tions in the same time span. Chey-

ney took a 35-27 lead into the locker

room at half time. . . .
Again Cheyney took the opening

jump, this time sinking the ball for

two points. The Pantherettes came
out like gang-busters, though, and
that was the last points’ the -Lady

_ Wolves would see for a while. While

The Pitt Pantherette swim team
rounded out three days ofswimming
with "times fast enough for Al,W
National qualification in nine
events. lt start’ed.Thursday when
Pitt swam against Michigan and
North_Carolina State in a triangular
meet. Pitt lost to‘N.C. State in the
last relay which decided the meet.
The Pantherettes, however.
drowned out top-ranked Michigan
by a devastating score of l04—36.
with Michigan only winning the
three-meter diving event.

This meet left Pitt with six of
those nine national qualifyingtimes:

posed of Linda Frankenbach.

Jan Ujevich with aqualifyingtime of

Pagain.

three shots from the sin stripe, cut-
ting the Cheyney lead to 52-51 with
4:45 remaining. A rash of Pitt tur-
novers iced the game for the Lady
Wolves as they were capitalizing on
the costly mistakes. It was a disap-
pointing 65-55 loss for
Pantherettes. A

Three Lady Wolves accounted for
55 of Cheyney’s 65 points. Valerie
Walker led with 19 points, and
Freda Glover and Yolanda Laney
added l8 each. Pitt was led.by Mik-
lasevich with 23 points and I2
rebounds. Penny Welsh chipped in
l0 points and H rebounds. Dolby
also had 10 points. Gail Aughburns
led the rebounding corpsiwith a

smoothly paved for the Pan-
therettes. Facing Youngstown State

in the opening round, Pitt enjoyed a"

comfortable 50-28 halftime lead,
and cruised to an 80-62 victory._

Again Miklasevich led the Pan-
therettes, pumping in 23 points and
hauling in a.game-high l0 rebounds.
Debbie Lewis contributed 19, Gail
Aughburns dumped in 16, and Lori
Dolby added 10 points to the well-
balanced Pantherette attack.

Youngstown got 25 from’ Wanda _

Grant and l5 from Holly Seimetz in
a losing cause.

Thesecond round had Pitt taking,

on DePaul, ateam that narrowly
defeated West Virginia in its first

round ga_me, 86-79. The Blue Dem-,

ons surprised the Pantherettes with

-a tough defense, and it took an over-‘

time before Pitt couldﬂclaim an,.85-84
win. - . ' V .— . '

Pitt jumped out to a 6-2 lead

before the Blue Demons could knot
it at 8-8. 1 However, the Pantherettes
defense snatched the ball from them
on several occasions, buildinga 14-8*

lead. At the 10-minute mark, the

Pantherettes had worked the lead to
25-10 on the strength of Dolby’s
sharpshooting from the outside, and

Aughburns’ dominance of the inside
. game." ' -
DePaul’s ﬂawless shooting in the

next six minutes closed the gap to

33-24, but Pitt's defense again rose‘
.t__o the occasion._,With key steals by

Dolby and Lewis, the Pantherettes
rebuilt their ‘lead, and the teams

wentto the locker room with ‘Pitt,

ahead, 42-28, .. . ~ .

Sue Heon with a qualifying time of

Outstanding triple-winning Pan-
therettes wereiSue Heon and Jan
Ujevich. Heon qualified for AIW
Nationals in the I00 back, setting a
pool record. and came within one
second ofqualifying in the 500 frees-

took five minutes to undo Pitt’s
surge. With just 3:38 to go, the Pan-

technical on the_D_ePaul coach put
Miklasevich at the foul line, upping
the lead to 69-67.

Three minutes stood betweenPitt
and victory, or so it seemed. Blue

Demon Christine Jaksy changed,

baskets, and with two minutes

remaining the Pantherettes were. up, . -

Pitt drew first blood in_the over-

time period, but DePaul responded

Linda

Ujevich with a.time of 7:36.82. This
was also a new pool record, beating
the old one set also by Pitt: Another
200-medley relay, with two different
Pitt swimmers than the one before,
also qualified for nationals. This
time swimming for Pitt were Linda
Frankenbach, Suzanne Pulley. Julie
Terrell, and Denise Sedlacek. Their
qualifying time was l:49.82. The
ninth event in which Pitt women
qualified for Nationals wasthe 400-
freestyle relay. The swimming was
done by Amy Jackson. Diana Firth,
Julie Terrell. and Jan lljevich, with a

qualifying time of 3:32.04.

Another relay from Pitt, which
took first place at PSU Relays, was
the 400-medley relay with Suzanne
