  Streit Will Speak
In Stephen Foster

By Jack Brady

A man who has risen from cor-

res'po11dent.”on’ the New York
Times to world wide__jfame as a,-
lecturer will make an appearance
on .-campus today when Clarence
Streit speaks at Foster Memorial
at.2:30 o’clock. .

Brought to the University campus
through the co—sponsorship of the
University -. International Relations
Club and Student—Faculty Associa-
tion, Mr. Streit". will speak today in
defense r-= of policies -outlined in his
recently published book, “Union
Now,év’ri ftoﬁ antaudience of city-wide
IRC memberswavnd other interested
students, according to Esther Marcu-
son,“ C41, chairman.‘ “

Today, Streit proposes that the 15 .
democracies unite to form a common
government for their peop1e—-a gov-
ernment based on the principle that
the state is made for man, not man
for the state, and organized on the
lines of the present United States
Constitution. .» . .

Mr. Streit believes that Soviet
Russia, -India, and the South "Amer-
ican countries should be left in a zone
by themselveshntil they are able to
meet the standards of the Western
democracies. .

Such ;a union ;would have a com-
mon citizenshipv, ’ -defense; force, cus-
toms, rnoney, and communications
system". It Wouldguarantee, explains
'f‘Union Now” each democracy the
right to govern its home affairs in its
own tongue according to its customs.

“open,doo,r” if they would guarantee
to their citizens the Union’s minimum

Amity Schedules
‘Two-«Gun Trot’
At Heine House

Setting a social tradition by sched-
uling the first new large dance for
several years, the Amity Club will
hold a “Two-Gun Trot” Saturday,
December 9." I A relatively. new or-
ganization on campus, the club is
opening its dance to all students.

Ticketsfor the trot which will be .

held at Heinz House are $1 per couple,

The chairnian says . . ..

“The name, the ‘Two-Gun Trot’
was inspired by Bill Calhoun, E42,

called ‘Two-Gun,’ rumor and Bill I

Frick, C41, publicity manager, have
it, since Jesse L. Lasky dubbed him
the perfect cowboy. A familiar
campus ﬁgure, Calhoun ﬁghts duels
with the University marshals every
day in the Commons Room and
‘holds up’ the Schenley theater and
Isaly’s every third day as a sideline.
In true ‘Two-Gun’ spirit the dance
will have a Western motive and the

men‘ will " be " ‘en‘c1niregea' to “dress as 

informally as they wish. Women
can wear what they please, they
always do anyhow.”

~ Annual Drive“R-esults=

A deﬁcit of $1,380 was reported on
the proposed General Alumni Asso-
ciation budget for this year,--which
was presented to the" Alumni Council
at their meeting Monday night, ac-
cording to Eugene L. Burkhart,_alum.-

ni secretary. , , .1 » _ -
The budget was based "upon..=th,e
supposition that the Association will
be self-supporting this year, with an
expected membership of ‘2,800.i The
budget madeno allowance for a sub-

sidy from the_»University." To date
the University has not notiﬁed the

usual subsidy this year. v

Harbaugh Miller, chairman of the
membership committee, reported that
the annual drive had,iup "until Mon-
day evening, shown.2,640 members,
over 90 per cent of the budget ex-
pected membership, although this is
only 65 per cent of last year’s. Miller
believes that the ultimate member-
ship of the Alumni Association this
year will be close to 3,500.

In order to make up the deﬁcit, the
Alumni Association will go back to
their former “giving plan,” which
when last used in 1923-24 brought
tme Association $20,000. Of this
money, the ‘Association used only
$9,000, giving the remaining $14,000
to the University. The giving plan
was discontinued when the campaign
to erect the Cathedral began.
Under the giving plan, each per-
son joining the Association contrib-
utes as much over $3 membership as
he desires to, the excess being placed
in thegeneral alumni funds.

much of this money was devotedtg

A blanket invitation has been ex-
tended to all members of the faculty
and student body to attend the an-
nual ,Women’s Day celebration Mon-
day from 4’ to 6 o’clock in the Com-
mons Room.

The traditions committee of WSGA

the reseption. _ M ‘

High point of the Woman’s Day
program will be the presentation, of a

cellor of the University, music,, the
cutting of a huge birthday cake, and
refreshments served by the members

also scheduled to give short vpep
talks. Every partymember who was
elected last year will be introduced
to the audience. I

And so begins the campaign drive
of the Independent Party. Replete
with phone calls, lists, button-hol-
ing, badges and forceful personalities,
the party will go out to round up
members, build up their loyalty, get
them to attend a nominating con-
vention to select slates, teach‘ them
the complicated system’ of voting,-
and get them out on election day.

All this the party must do with-
out the aid of the disciplined mem-
bership that their opponents, the
fraternity coalition, obtain through
brotherhood, gou loyalty, and
fines. j , ‘

As usual, the prime point in the
independent campaign literature,
will be that while the Independents
are not anti—fraternity, the party does
want a more equitable distribution
of political power on the campus.

Independent campaign literature
should be worth watching this year
since it is being run by Aldisert, who
has been a publicity agent for the

A The Alumni Association

Reports a Budget llcficit

Behind the announcement of the $1,380 deﬁcit in the budget
submitted at this week’s meeting of the Alumni Council are some
facts which indicate that all is not happiness and peace between
the University and the General Alumni Association.

Signiﬁcant in the new alumni budget is the omission of any
allowance for partial support by the University. If the alumni
receive no subsidy from the University this year, a deﬁnite reversal
of the former policy will have been made. The University has
been helping to support the General Alumni Association since 1933;
during 1938-39 the subsidy was $11,000, about half of the alumni
budget.

E ‘This year, the University has delayed payment of the usual
alumni subsidy. Alumni ofﬁcials have not received deﬁnite word
that the subsidy has been cut off. But the fact that their budget
makes no allowance for any University aid is an indication that

__ they expect nothing this year.

The answer of the Alumni Association to their position has
’-been the intensiﬁed membership campaign being carried on this

" fall. ‘Last’ year-, of the 25,000 graduates of the University, the

Alumni Association had a membership of about 4,000. The present
drive with results incomplete, shows a reported membership of

2,640‘, about 65 per cent of last year’s total.

Because of its reduced income, the Alumni Association has been
The ﬁrst issue of the pr1ze—w1nn1ng
Alumni Review in October was shortened to 16 pages. But in spite

of a slim budget, the alumni are working actively.

Focal point of alumni activity is the nomination in the spring
of 13 members to the Board of Trustees. Alumni ofﬁcials are de-
termined that these nominess shall represent the policy of the asso-
ci_at'ion_, which has declared itself “ready to do everything possible
to correct conditions as found by its own investigating committee
and ‘the Trustees" investigating committee by the adV00ati0I1 Of
suchichanges in policy or in personnel as in its judgment will best
serve the interests of the University.”

‘ Comparison ofthis statement of policy with the fact that the
alumnihave not_ received. a University subsidy this year gives evi-
dence that there are potential ﬁreworks in this situation.

   Gocs Educational

\Vitl1 Movies, Clarence Strcit

' In these times much interest is being centered upon how best
to prevent the present conditions from ever re-curring again. As a
preventative of war, and as a peace solution after this war, much
thought, is being given to some sort of world state, which will pre-
vent ﬁghting among nations.

Clarence Streit, author and newspaperman, has presented the
r‘no,stwidely known of such plans. The interest that the plan has
aroused and the backing it has received, shows that possibly, in the
course of events, i_t may vitally inﬂuence the activities of the na-
tions of" the world. Therefore it is well worthwhile for every stu-
dent to take time off and go down to Foster Memorial this afternoon
and hear the author explain his plan.

’_ International relations Club and SFA are to be commended
for -bringing this outstanding speaker here. Since it follows
just on the heels of the theatre program yesterday, it seems to in-
dicate a new and worthwhile policy of SFA. \Ve think SFA is

to ‘be,’ commended, too, for its new interest in education at the

University.

 the pep assemblies, and “no corsage policies,” that have
been sole interest of SFA in the last few years, are vital to the
school’s social life, there is much to be said for its new idea of

sponsoring programs that will allow an engineer to learn a little
political theory, or an economics major to ﬁnd out what a great

physicist does, or someone from the school of nursing to see what
‘soil erosion means to the nation she lives in. <

1. Case of Civil Liberties
 Comrade Earl Browdcr

‘-"L’ affaire Browder”- at Harvard and other eastern Univer-
sities should be_an object lesson to college administrators that it
pays to do more than to offer merely lip service to the principle of
‘freedom of speech. - . * A

. _ -\Vhen permission was asked by a recognized student group at
Harvard—~and the same is to be said of Princeton, Dartmouth and
other schools—-to have Earl Browder, head of the Communist Party,
speak on campus, they should have been allowed to do so.

Refusing such permission is an obvious violation of free speech.
A recognized group at Harvard, the John Reed Society, had asked
to have him speak.
the communist leader on campus by trickery.

But the Harvard authorities—as the other schools later found
-—felt that free speech wasn’t involved, but that it was a matter of
“good taste.” Browder, they said was under a federal indictment.

- The obvious fallacies in this argument are being readily pointed out

by the critics of the action.

The effects of the refusal, are, however, more interesting than
its correctness. A wave of requests for Browder to speak has swept
over the New England campi. At Yale, the Communist leader had
a large if unimpressed audience. To allow or not to allow Browder
to speak has become a bugaboo to college heads all over the east.

And what does Mr. Erowder speak about? The position of the
Communist Party and the present Russian foreign policy—which
to do at this time would put him squarely behind the eight ball. Cer-
tainly not.

He praises free speech and defends the bill of rights and the
Constitution. For allowing him the opportunity to do this and to
further confuse the issues, we think that certain eastern college ad-
ministrators might be classed as accessories to aiding Communist
propaganda.

By E. Seymour Kerber

, World War II descended upon the
nations of Europe in all its force

September 1, and has already be- V

gun to make its inﬂuence felt upon
the cultures of the world. A

The war itself, being at least 500
miles away as yet, didn’t cause us to
ponder much, but when the Car-
negie International, which we had
expected to bring forth an autumn
glory of colorful ﬂags, brought out
only the red, white, and blue and a
few somber, and thin, City of Pitts-
burgh ﬂags, we woke up.
Flags of Nations '

Following World War I, the Inter-
national reopened in 1920 after a
ﬁve year “interlude” with four 90-
foot poles and banners modeled

after St. Marks’ in Venice. In 1929,- 

mostly because of their age, they
gave way to the ﬂags of the exhib-
iting nations.

Since international situations grew
worse during the last year and only
ﬁve nations and a handful of ex-

Roerich Pact Flag

There is one ﬂag we have. hopes of ,

not seeing; wave across the street,
the Roerich pact flag, a “red circle
with a triple sphere in a circ1e,on
a white background,” which, accord-
ing to the treaty between the United
States and 20 other American re-
publics, signed at Washington April
movable artistic and scientiﬁc insti-
tutions and historic monuments. '
iNothing has been said in the
present European propaganda about

‘the Roerich pact ﬂag has been

ﬂown anywhere yet. Belgium, one
of the big promoters of the, pactin
1931, probably has hidden he_r,treas-
ures, movable or “immovable,” re-
membering the “inv;iolate” ;Red
Cross flags of 1914-18. a’
Make War Humane? ,

We’re glad, as we implied before,
that the Carnegie institute’ hasn’t
taken to flying the Roerich ﬂag. We
hope the International will” never
need it; we are also against the Uni-
versity’s investing in one.

In fact, we rather side with the
New York Times of September 6,
1931 on the whole subject. It is
asinine to make war humane-why
not outlaw war?

Anti-War Plans

With a warning that “the second
world war” has created “great dan-
ger of a repetition of the war hys-
teria of 1917” and that “the signs
are already clearly visible of a con-
certed drive against civil liberties,”
the American Committee for De-
mocracy and Intellectual Freedom
last week announced a series of
projects through which it is ‘‘pre..
pared to take up the cudgels in de-
fense of the Bill of Rights and in.
tellectual freedom at any point of
threat, in or out of the schools.”

The American Committee’s pro-
gram was issued by the national ex-
ecutive committee, including Pro-
fessor Franz Boas of Columbia Uni-
versity as chairman, Dean Christian
Gauss of Princeton, Professor Wes-
ley C. Mitchell, president of the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, and Professor
Ernest Minor Patterson, president of
the American Academy of Social
and Political Science.

In America, the committee stated,
“there must be no recurrence of the
subjection of science and culture to
a propaganda of hatred.” Citing its
support of the National Education
Association in its insistence upon
strict objectivity of discussion of the
present war in the schools, the Com-
mittee declared that “a concerted
effort to ‘present to the American
people the, truth about war and
peace, can contribute much to weak-
en the effectiveness of anti-freedom,
antl-alien,‘ and pro-war propa-
ganda.”

The ﬁrst step in its program, the
committee announced, will be a
public report on war and intellectual
freedom, analyzing concretely the
effects of the first world war and
of the present war on intellectual
freedom and civil rights in both
belligerent and neutral nations.

A SIMPLE BIT or
REASONING

If the ‘University were to announce that all student ‘publi.-I.  . P
cations cease, the student body would be quick to  
protest. “Student publications here at Pitt, just as anywherejgf-f~i

, in America, are dependent on the students themselves. They

must edit, they read and they support.

 The success of student publications, ﬁnancially, direct-
ly depends upon the students. The money paid by the stu-
dent for his] copies  triﬂing compared to the cost of running
the individual magazine or newspaper. The important

source of revenue comes from advertising, national and local.

Local merchants are always willing and ready to adver.
tise as long as they feel their advertisements are being ob-
served, and acted upon. Why not make it a habit of reading
the advertising sections of your publications, as well as look-
ing into the services and products of the advertiser? If
their products and services are inferior, tell us . . . if they

are satisfactory, patronize them.

After all, these merchant-advertisers enable the editors

of your publications to give you better publications.

FROM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL MCELWAIN
Sports Editor

FOR SOME REASON, people are still talking about the drop-

ping of West Virginia from the

Pitt 1940 football schedule. The

general opinion seems to be that someone somehow was knifed. No-
body has brought forth deﬁnite proof who or how, but the idea is

still there.

It ’s difﬁcult to get an accurate account of what happened. The
boys at VVest Virginia say they knew nothing about the break until

Pitt released its schedule.

According to Morgantown, the Pitt-

West Virginia game for 1940 was practically a certainty, which, if
true, looks like more of the purported “broken promises.”
Unfortunately for this account, there is another view of the

situation, that of the University authorities.

Up on the twenty-sev-

enth ﬂoor, no one is much concerned with the \Vest Virginians’

howls of pained “surprise.”

The attitude upstairs is that VVest Virginia has nothing t'o com-

plain about.

Pitt athletic bigwigs say the Mountaineers had not

been promised the game, that West Virginia was one of several teams
under consideration for the eighth spot on the 1940 schedule, and
that Ohio State was considered the best choice.

In addition, the Ohio State game was not unexpected. The ar-

rangements had been on the ﬁre for some time.

break with the Mountaineers is not considered permanent. Whether
the Panthers and the “snakes” get together again on the gridiron

is problematical, but not unlikely.

WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED a “lamentable commentary’ ’on
organized baseball appeared in the papers the other day. Ken Kelt-
ner, Cleveland Indians’ third baseman, applied for a $15 a week
state job on the grounds that he wasunemployed during the winter.
The Ohio compensation board refused the application.

It is truly a shame when a baseball player is so poorly paid dur-
ing the summer that he is forced to seek public aid during the off
months. Keltner’s salary is reported to be in the starvation wage
level, about $7500 per year. This can not go on!

 There may come a time when hard-ﬁsted and hard-hearted em-
ployers realize the worth of the men working for them. Athletics
have been notoriously poor pay. Top wage for major league hockey
players is less than $8,000, baseball hirelings seldom get more than

$15,000, and boxers rarely go over the $100,000 limit for a ﬁght.
- T The situation is even more deplorable in amateur athletics.

A

first class football school will occasionally put up about $5,000 for a

star’s four years in school, but this the exception.
schools pay less than $1,000 per school

graceful.

Most southern
year. Such a system is dis-

If this is to be a free country, a land of equal opportunity, stand-
ards of living must be raised. And the ﬁrst steps must be made in
athletics, the backbone of American democracy. We demand for all
athletes a 20% wage increase, collective bargaining, and unemploy-

ment compensation for everyone.

The present shameful conditions, vividly portrayed in Keltncr’s

case, must go!

Punks’ Record

 Results Extend Playoff
 By Extra Return Game

_As, Jack Eitel scored twice, the Phi
Gems. smeared the previously pure
Punk"record with a 12-6 last Tuesday
afternoon. The Fiji victory extends
the‘.,playoﬁs, the deciding contest to
be played at a later date.

Throughout the game the Punks
were handicapped by the lack of a
complete team. The major part of
the ﬁrst half, they played with but
ﬁve men, while a one-man addition
bolstered the Punk defense» in the
second period.

The Phi Garns struck twice in the
ﬁrst half, a Watson-Eitel pass, pre-
ceded by Eitel’s interception and a
short heave, accounting for the lrst
score. Watson’s attempt forithie ‘ex-
tra point was no good.

On the play following the next
kick-off, Eitel again grabbed scoring
honors. He pulled down a Punk pass
at midleld and galloped 40 yards for
touchdown number two. Watson
again failed to convert.

Ziolkowski’s passing was at an all-
season low last Tuesday and addition-
al passers had to be called on to ac-
complish the lone Punk tally. Mel
Port’s heave to Scherer was complet-
ed on. an interference ruling, setting
the next play up on the Phi Gain 10.

With, Ziolkowski back, the ball was
passed to Kocheran, playing up close,
who shoved the ball across the goal
line to Milanovich.

r.“Rip” Collins came in for the Punks
at the tail end of the first half and
counted as the sixth man till he was
injured midway in the last half. Vuj-
novic came in a play later to continue
to‘ aid the Trackhousers’ defense.

»}A fast charging Fiji line was re-
sponsible for Ziolkowski’s failure.
M_acNeill, accounted for ﬁve of the
losses chalked up against the un-
fortunate Punk passer.

-Christy Watson was in his usual
form, completing nine passes out of
24 attempts. However, he shifted his
attentions from receiver Bill Ed-
miunds, favoring Mansﬁeld and Eitel
with a few tosses.

-When the ﬁnal game for the intra-
mural title comes around, the Punks
should be at full strength and quite
likely to break into the win column
again.

Collembolae Field Trip

Collembolae, honorary natural sci-
ence fraternity, will make a ﬁeld trip

H urd Schedule

Team Will Meet Butler
In Year’s Initial Game

The University of Pittsburgh's
promising cage stars this year face
o~ne“of' the hardest‘ schedules‘ in the‘
long history of the school, a schedule
that replaces Duquesne and George-
town with such stalwarts as Michi-
gan, Indiana, Ohio State, Navy, Ge-
neva, and Waynesburg.

In a year which may be “the sec-
ond golden era in Pitt basketball,”
the ﬁrst being the days of Charley
Hyatt, Pitt will meet more stumbling
blocks than the poor turkey which
evaded the Democratic Thansgiving
holiday-

’ Butler University will be their ﬁrst
foe, a team that won 14 out of 20
games last year and has nine return-
ing lettermen. Not long after, the
Panthers will trade two pointers with
four Big Ten foes: Northwestern,
Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana.

Indiana and Ohio State appear for
the ﬁrst time on the ‘Pitt ‘schedule.
Both roused sports writers’ adjectives
last year with their imposing per-
formances.

Johnny Kincaid, the Buckeye All

American, returns this year and will
cause many a coach some breath-
taki.ng moments. The Hoosiers have
always had one of the ‘leading teams
in the midwest, but little is known of
their abilities.
‘ Prosser and Stopper have been lost
to Penn State through graduation but
the Lions expect eight returning let-
termen, and a few recruits from a
good frosh team. Westminster, the
former South High team who were
state champs under Grover Washa-
bauagh and followed hi Into the Ti-
tan’s domain, expects mainstays Mil-
ler, Wasik and Spak to return.

Waynesburg peeks into Pitt’s bas-
ketball realms for the ﬁrst time,
though little is known of them this
year. They are the ﬁve that handed
an “invincible” Duquesne team a
lacing last year.

The Plaid of Tech cannot expect
much this year. An- All-American,
Stark, will ring up baskets with reg-
ularity but his support will be faulty.
West Virginia is reported to have a
strong team, mainly because of their

rangy frosh ﬁve that ran rings around ’

Pitt’s freshman aggregation.

At present, Dr. Carlson, Pitt ﬂoor
mentor and recognized as an out-
standing authority on the ﬂoor game,
Is experimenting with a 20-inch bas-
ket which is two inches larger than
the present regulation size. It is ex-
pected that if such a basket were in-
stituted, a higher scoring game would
be developed.

This trial was carried on at the
University of Missouri, and results
showed that the outside shots split
the cords with far more accuracy.

Pitt Squad’s All-Opponent Team

By Bert Jaife
\Vith George McAfee setting

D
the pace by his unanimous selec-
tion, Duke university of the sun-
ny South placed three men on
Pitt’s All-Opponent team that
showed players from seven of the
nine teams that the Golden Pan-
thers faced this past year.

Together with McAfee on the first
eleven were team-mates Willard
Perdue, roly-poly end, and co-cap-
tain “Sweet Pea” Johnson, a hard
charging guard.

Closely behind, with two represen-
tatives each, followed the Carnegie
Tech Tartans, with Merlyn Condit
and Bill Rieth, and Cornhuskers’

Herman “Roaring” Rohrig, and
wingman Seeman.
Four schools placed one man

apiece on the first team selected by
the gridders, coaches, and sports
writers of the Pitt News. Gajecki,
Penn State center, received the sec-
ond highest number of ballots and
stood head and shoulders above any
pivot man the Panthers faced all
year. Carl Nery of Duquesne, Kol-
man of Temple, and Principe of

- Fordham round out the initial elev-

en.

Of ‘the 26 ballots received which
included votes from Coaches Bow-
ser and Hoel, and publicity direc-
tor Carver, McAfee hit the jack-
pot with two dozen and two, closely
followed by Gajecki, Kolman, and
Condit, all receiving better than 20
votes.

Of the eleven men selected, eight
showed their wares on the stadium
turf and left little doubt as to their
respective ability. George McAfee
spearheaded a Duke attack that fell
one point shy of a tie with the Pan-
thers and an undefeated season for
the Blue Devils of Durham. .

Perdue proved just as trouble-
some this year as he was in Durham
last season when he blocked a Chick-
erneo punt and fell on it in the end
zone for the solitary score in a game
that saw Eric Tipton keep the Jungle
Cats bottled up in their end of the
field all afternoon.

“Sweet Pea” Johnson, Duke’s third
man to be honored by the Pitt elev-
en, gave the Panthers a tough af-
ternoon with his ferocious charging
on the defense and his vicious block-
ing when the southerners had pos-
session of the ball.

Carnegie’s Condit and Rieth acted
as a thorn in the P,anther’s hide op
Armistice Day, although the Pittites
finally connected with a wild aerial
thrust in the final minutes of the
fray to bring back the purloined goal
posts. Condit lived up to all the
press notices in his scrap book with
his hard running, good kicking, and
great defensive play. Rieth was a

bulwark on defense, and continually

perked up the morale of the team
with his brilliant playing.

As a perfect sniper both with his
toe and arm, Herman Rohrig, led a
strong Nebraska team to its first win
over Pitt since many of the present
students were still wearing three-
cornered pants. Rohrig’s quick-kicks
surpassed those of any kicker since
the — first bonds were issued on
Pitt’s Stadium. , His accurate passing
and shifty running were responsible
in no little way for the Cornhusker
victory. _

Sharing .honors for the Nebraska
triumph with “Roaring Herman”
was Seeman, a wizard defensive end.
Seeman played the same type of
game as a predecessor, rangy Dohr-
man who played on the Nebraska
eleven two seasons ago. I

’ Although inconspicuous on the of-
fense except for his punting, Carl
Nery, Duquesne jack of all trades.

received high praise from his Pan-
ther opponents after the first tussle
for the city crown. The Spring-
dale giant consistently smeared the
Cats’ attack before it could get from
behind the line of scrimmage. Late
in the game after the Dukes assumed
the lead, Nery shone like a beacon
light in the Bluff line-up.

Dick Cassiano, ace Panther back,
issued the following compliment to
Temples great. tackle, Kolman, “He
hit me so hard and so often that I
went through nine games in one
quarter against him.” Every Pan-
ther back but one selected Kolman
as a tackle on the All-Opponent
team. He was largely responsible
for the close score in the Panther
game with the Owls.

The center of this mythical team
proved to be an easy selection for
the Panther gridders. Gajecki breez-
ed in so far ahead of the other two
centers who received votes that it
brought back shadows of Maine and
Vermont. The State’ pivot ‘man-Iwas
a 60-minute ball player for 60 min-
utes. He shone on pass, defense from
his backer-up position, and his dead-
ly tackling kept the Panther attack

Sports to Begin

- On Wednesday, December 6, the
winter intramural sports competition
will begin. The sports program will
be the same as in previous years with
three leagues, the fraternities, engi-
neers, and independents.

Basketball, volleyball, handball,
sports included in the program, but
individuals compete in only two of
these sports. All games are to be
staged in the Trees Gym with bas-
petball also being played on the Pitt
stadium ﬂoor. The site of the bowl-
ing alleys is as yet undecided.

Swimming and indoor track are
the extra sports this year, and may
be played even though one is com-
peting in two other sports. Coach
Grady is to be in charge of all the
swimming meets,‘ a major activity
this year. I

All competition is to be based on
the round robin method in which
each team plays every other one.

Mr. Potts, head of the intramural
oﬁice, states that any team wishing
to enter a sport may still do so if they
immediately secure an entry blank
in the intramural office at the Trees
Gym.

Any team may use the Trees gym
for practices by making arrange-
ments with the intramural oﬁice.

Men’s Council wondered too.

They had watched University
swains passﬁup. a1l..the gala affairs

just because they hadn’t a tuxedo‘

while their one-and-onlies tripped
off with someone else. Then Men’s
Council had the bright idea of es-

tablishing a tuxedo exchange.

Last year A1 Ludwig, BA41, vice

A president of Men’s Council announced

that Men’s Council would rent tux-
edoes and tails to students for formal
dances. The tuxedoes would be sup-
plied by students. As an experiment,
the idea was so successful that this
year Men’s Council will make the
tuxedoexchange a permanent service.

This year tuxedos will be availa-
ble for all occasions, Ludwig an-
nounced. They may be obtained for
banquets, dances, debates, and din-
nersat home. _

To make this possible", Ludwig
says, all undergraduates who have
tuxedoes to rent may ﬁll out the bal-
lot below. Men’s Council will act
only as a medium of exchange. The
owners of the tuxedoes may set their
own rental fee. The"balIots should
be ﬁlled out and deposit in the dean
