“This is quite unique,” said Dr.

swinging doors bearing “-No Admit-

“This thing has spread from other
cities to Atlanta—fr’om Houston,
Chicago, New York and Los
Angeles—children are being mur-
dered wholesale across our country

and no one is doing anything,”-

Camille Bell; mother of slain
Atlanta child, said at a press confer-
ence Sunday in Pitt_sbu'rgh’s;Soldiers
and Sailors Hall. 4 '
Bell ‘came to Pittsburgh along
with Georgia State Senator Julian
Bond to tell the “truth” about
‘ Atlanta and the conditions of blacks
in America during a memorial ser-

vice for Dr; Martin Luther King Jr. 1.

and the 22 dead or missing children
of Atlanta. . is

done to us, but in Atlanta we can-
not," Bell said. “We are going to
have to get to the point where we can
expect responsiveness and leader-
ship from whoever is in charge."

While not in agreement with Bell
over the responsiveness of Atlanta
officials, Bond said it was necessary
for blacks to become.“self-reliant"in
dealing with this and other
problems.

\

“With the Reagan program of

I budget cuts, we are now in an era of

forced self-reliance," Bond said.

“We never tapped all of the resour-

ces of our community in the Sixties,

and we are not now. but l think we

can. There isa great deal ofstrength

‘ 4- there.” . _\

tAccordi'ng to Bell, her group is

trying todojust that.

“Everywhere, when something
like this happens, people go back to
business as usual," Bell said. “We
contend that mothers in Atlanta will
not go back to business as usual. As
individuals we may not be able to
change_things, but as a group we can
make a difference.” .

Bell stressed the universality of
“child murder,” labeling all things
that work to keep blacks and poor
people a permanent underclass,
including bad education, health care
and lack of economic opportunity.‘

7:} Her solution to these problems is a
tighter community fabric.

“We need to get to know who our

neighbo‘rs are: our knowledge is our . .

protection," Bell said.

Bell touched on a number of fea-
tures in what Bond has referredto as
a “circus atmosphere” in Atlanta:
vigilante groups, solicitation of
fund_s for the families and the gen-
eral effects of publicity.

“We don’t "solicit money for the7

to___ suffer the double tragedy of.
dependence that comes with
charity.”

‘Bell spoke of a memorial fund

"‘ ' - ILn.~5.'.\\79‘1»59 ‘

families,” Bell said. “We don’t want» »

dedicated to the memory ofthe slain
children and of the need to direct
sympathetic feelings for the Atlanta
children into constructive commun-
ity works projects. ’

“Why should the poor of Pitts-
burgh support the poor of Atlanta,
when there are poor in Pittsburgh?”

,Bell said. “A tribute to the Atlanta

Bell, along with Bond. denounced

to the situation. Referring to the

Bond was moreexplicit when it
came to the’ general plight of _blacks“
in America. Citing dozens of statisrg :;
tics, he made one point clear:~“all”
across the cotlntrysblacks are being}
challenged." 1   A '

  

“In Atlanta today tragedy has”.
caught the national spotlight,” he
said “but all over our relative condi
tion has grown worse,” ‘ A A

Blind blames ,the Reagan __.eco-I
nomic policy of cutting the budget,..'
for creating conditions" for a._.ip_e“r. A
mane_nt -underclass in America‘

_ ‘Under the new administrati‘on’s-pro’
"grams, Bond contends, hug,
T numbers of personsrwill be pushed.
over the brink of poverty. _ c  A

“Our children,“ Bond said, .
“reflect the hardships for-those of us "A
in‘ America whose skin is dark.” T

 Bond characterizes the current -.
political andteconomic situationiasa
“bunch of Robin Hoodsin. Reverse, T

‘ stealing from thepoor to line _the“ T
batik accounts of the rich.”  R 0

His solution comesin two part

First, Bond said,‘ Blacks can no‘
longer “afford to ignore the political
process; “We are the most unregis;
tered group in the ,country,” Bond
said, “it is like fighting a batt_le__’w,itjh"‘
only half an army.” , -  

zsecond, Bond believes it-is.neces-
’ sary for blacks to become, ;po,lit A
. cal.ly,cmore sophisticated. Referring

‘Carter received in 1976, he “sat:
“they know the words to our h_ym_r_i

Enforcement of Hijack Law May Have Stopped Hinckley

ASSOCIATED PRESS

NEW YORK—Just hours after

V.-v«,_John Hinckley Jr. was tackled by

F)

‘’ Secret Service agents and charged
with trying to kill President Reagan,
authorities identified him as the
same John Hinckley who tried to
board a plane in Nashville, Tenn.
last October with three handguns
and 50 rounds of ammunition.

Former president Jimmy Carter
was in Nashville the same day.

Eyebrows went up around the
nation when it was revealed that
Hinckley had been booked on a mis-
uemeanor charge in Nashville and

The Pitt News, Manda;/,‘ApriI 6, 1981

released within an hour on a $02.50
bond.

But the fact is that federal authori-
ties rarely bring charges against indi-
viduals who attempt to board planes
with concealed firearms, leaving it
up to local jurisdictions to
prosecute.

That’s because many violators
have permits for the weapons in
other states and are not intent on

hijacking the aircraft-—or ofassassi-

nating anyone. officials say. They
may also simply be moving gun col-
lections between states. or tojewelry
dealers or antique collectors. Or
they may want ‘-the guns for
protection.

“People come into New York
thinking it’s the crime capital of the
world.” said Capt. Henry DeGe-
neste. police commanding officer at
LaGuardia Airport. “Ifthey’re com-
ing from Arizona. for example.

_ where its legal to carry a gun, they

might forget when leaving New
York that it isn’t legal here. The gun
is detected when they go to board the
plane, they’re in violation of FAA
regulations and local laws and
placed under arrest. ‘
“We contact both the FBI and
FAA security people." he said.
“Federal people decide through the
U.S. attorney ifthey want to take the
arrest. Usually, it doesn’t seem to be

an attempt to hijack an aircraft and
the feds don’t prosecute and we go
with state charges." '
State laws regarding guns form a
legal crazy quilt. And whathappens
to violators whose weapons are
detected with airport screening devi-
ces varies from jurisdiction. One
person can be charged with a misde-
meandr and face a small fine.
Another may‘ face a felony charge
with a possible jail term and thou-
sands ofdollars in fines. In all cases,
weapons are seized and ballistics
checks are run.
In HinckIey’s case. “He wasjust a
man...going through the terminal,
just an ordinary passenger, and then

makes boarding an aircraft with —
intent to hijack a serious felony with .
penalties of up to $I0,000 in fines,‘ 20

spokesman John Russell, the V

Gathering    
Clout 

“We are the most unregistered group in the country.
lt’s like fighting a battle with halfan army,” Georgia
State Senator Julian Bond said at yesterday’s press
conference and memorial service for Dr. Martin.
Luther King Jr. and the 22 dead or missing Atlanta
children. Bond correctly emphasized that black and
the poor, members of what he termed as the “perman-
ent underclass” need to develop strong political aware-
ness and action to combat the unresponsiveness’ of
public officials.

Vigilantism, illustrated by the “Bat Patrol,”a com-
munity organized neighborhood in an,Atlanta Hous-
ing Project’ was rejected by Bond as adding an.
“unnecessary level of grandeur” to the situation.
Although the tragedy of the Atlanta murders and the
helplessness of the plight of the poor are_strong em_o-
tional situations, they must be dealt with in a calcu-
lated manner. To illicit responses and action from the
public requires mor_e'than just emotions; ' V

Bond proposed a two part solution for what he
‘termed as a “robin.hood in reverse” economic and‘
political situation: _ =

—first, active participation in the political process.

—second, political sophistication: “

System
if -Dear Editor:

Our university system is such that
an instructor with a goodlprogram
and an unyielding concern for_his
students is not permitted to con-
tinue. The instructor is Doug Jones
and the program is Architectural
Studies. A Ph.D., tenure, the right

connections, anchorage in a depart- '

ment, and proper outside funding
are not necessarily the proper ingre-
dients for making a good teacher, as
we are all well aware. l think an
_ injustice is being done here.’ A

As lv graduate this April, l can
proudly look back at my education
as being a solid, productive and

A encouraging foundation for any and
all of my future endeavors. This I
attribute to the program which is
designed to either serve as an excel-
lent proparation for graduate train-
ing orto allow the imagination and
creativity of the individual student
toidetermine hisor her QWH Career.
The nature of the curriculum is criti-
cal and comparative in scone. and

gives the student 2 svnthesis of dis‘-"

ciplinary perspectives This in tiirn
allows the student to compare archi-
tecture with other forms ofexpres- '

sion, while also placing emphasison v

contemporary architecture.

Prevents Quality

Together this develops a well-
rounded understanding of the envir-
onment as an intergral_ part /of
society and culture.

But more importantly, the pro-
gram encourages one to think. By
proposing nothing finite, the student
must work for some goal not spelled
out by his major-‘s title. Similar to
architecture, he learns that his edu-
cation does not end in four years,
but continues throughout his whole
life. He develops a critical reflection
of his own values,-which makes him
investigate, analyze and be aware of
his surrounding conditions.,But he

Teaching

also has become aware of how to
explore, be innovative, and yet how
to be flexible and adapt to new con-
ditions. This is the essence ofwhat a
student should learn. Our present
college system has forgotten, or
should, I dare say neglected, to
develop the individual’s character
along with his profession. M

This is not aplea to save the pro-
gram, but is intended as awnote of
"thanks to Doug Jones for, in my.
opinion, he has done his job well.
Thank you and good luck_.‘

Blacks in particular can no longer accept politicali  in     

WEAR A HELMET. No exciep-', T’ '

promises; Carter’s failure to follow through on his-

commitment to blacks is a case in point. It is precisely

this lack of political clout that enables the inefficiency
. and apathy of Atlanta authorities to exist. 4

Camille Bell, mother ofa slain Atlanta child stressed
another area blacks and the poor must strengthen in

, orderto be heard; a tight community fabric.

“We need to know who our neighbors are; our
knowing is our protection.“ Bell said. Bell also said’
that people cannot accept a “back to business as usual"

_attitude concerning t-he Atlanta murders. “as individu-
als we may not be able to change things. but as a group
we can make a difference," she said.

The points Bell arid Bond made are too_important to ‘
ignore. Strong political clout and community organi-
zation will accomplish more than the disarray that
occurs becauseof frustration in dealing with a difficult
political, and emotional situation. lt is precisely the
channeling of emotion into a strong, cohesive organi-
zation that will incite Atlanta and public authorities to

For sponts fans, Sunday after-
noons in early April are a verita-
‘ble paradise. For the TV sports
addict on an NBA playoff Sun-
day morning, catch a quick
— breakfast around l2:30 and turn,
* on Channel 2 for a NBA playoff
' doubleheader.
ltfs going to be a good set of
T zgames. First, Boston is to take on
' _ Chicago and then L.A‘. will play
Houston; Or, it could be Phila-
delphia vs. Milwaukee and Kan-
sas City vs. Portland. Hmmm!
Bird vs. Gilmore, Jabbar and
Magic vs. Moses, the Doctor
against Marques, Birdsong vs.
Thompson. Should be a great
one!
l2:50 p.m.: Put the TV on to
warm up.‘ Bette Davis movie is
winding down. Go to make a
sandwich and prepare some

Pat Ewing A

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

After an introduction that
included a list of honors and acco-
lades almost as long as his 7-foot
frame, Pat Ewing, generally consi-
dered thebest high school basketball
player in the country, loped out of
the tunnel and onto the floor amid a
thunderous round of applauseas the
spotlight“ followed him to center-

-court of the dimmed Civic Arena

After _the"’ action had started,
Ewing——the man most ofthe |5,l52
fans had come to see—gave the
audience everything it wanted, and
maybe some more that nobody had
asked for. ‘~  l ‘ A

The game was perhaps the final
chapter in the illustrious history of
the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic.
The game, which.pitted the United
.States All-Star team against the
Pennsylvania‘. All-Stars Friday
night, was a misma_tc.h of gigantic
proportions. ln more ways than one.

Forget that the score was I08-73,_
as the U.S. team cruised past the
outmanned and outclassed Pennsyl-
vania squad. That was expected.
The U.S. roster, studded with a
lineup of high school.All-Americans
that could easily fill a list of Who’s
Who in schoolboy basketball, domi— '
nated almost all facets of thegame.
-By the time the clock had churned
down to the final minutes, the con-
test had ‘become showtime for the
U.S stars, as they-- poufed in, the
points with flair. P T M l '

But the game action was a sub- K
plot, overshad'ow._ed by the presence
of Ewing, Ewingbeganlthe game as
the crowd's darling, and'he ended it
as thelgoat when he wh-irled and flat-
tened Pennsylvania’s' Victor Alex-_

‘ ander with a wicked elbow to. the

head late in the game. .

Alexander_ Slay sprawled on the
ﬂoorboards for 4 several- minuted
clutching his right forehead before
being assisted to. the bench. Ewing.
looking somewhat-d‘i'stress'ed, fouled K
out on the play and exited under a
torrent _of boos, The wave of boos,
mounted ‘once more —after the
game—when Ewing was announced
team's Most ‘ Valuable’ '
Player." 0 ‘

In the locker room after the game‘, .
Ewing said he,was.not trying to l*.'urt
_-anybody. His high school coach‘,
Mike Jarvis, who coached. the U.S. _
team, called the incident unfortu-

' _nateC'°J ohn ‘Thompson, the coaching

   

heir to Ewingwhen he gradu,a'tes to

Thompson said. ‘‘'He's got to learn to
expect that, and that will come with
maturity.” '

Nobody was willing to slaylthe

'. elbow- was fintentional~—it didn’t

appear to be. But’itl was unfortunate

that the incident may be what Ewing‘

is most remembered _for in his initial
appearance in Pittsburgh, despite
the other fireworks he created’ on the

court with his performance, which i

was, at least, spectacular.
Ewing warmed up with an electri-
fying assortment of stuffs that_drew

th‘e _oohs and aahs of the crowd. It .
was an extraordinary exhibition'in ”

the art_of dunking that included a

gs-.,_jack—knifing slam after Ewing had

launched himself from the‘ foul line.
Another dunk in his repertoire:
overhead dunk in which he squeezed
the ball with two hands,’dipping' it
back over his head with his long,

‘ long arms seemingly extended all the.

way to half-court and then back over
the top. The ball came d_own with
such force that the net hissed.

Oh, don’t forget the “windmill”--—‘
when Ewing cradled the ball in the

.crook of his wrist, brought it up

from his waist and down again, his
arm blurred like a~propeller, as he
rammed the ball throughthe hoop
and almost through the floorboards.

Ewing qhaas an advantage over i

some of the gmntsgthat have pre-
ceded h,im.'.-‘izito, collegiate vranks..

Unlike ‘Bowie or‘ Sampson, the 230- -
pound Ewing already has ‘ some"-

bulk. His legs are thick andfsturdy,
like two ebony pillars and as immov-

able as telephone poles once he digs

them .in for position. -His’ gait -i_sn’t
gangly when he r.uns—Ewing glides
despite his size. His arms and

shoulders are not pencil thin, like,

say a Bowie. And Ewing can only get
bigger—'once,‘he 'doé:’s‘:'l"he' could be
another Moses Malone if he can add
a little muscle; \ . t _ '
Once -the game e started, Ewing
dominated both offensively and def-

V ensively, setting the, tone ofthe game‘

for»the‘Pennsy/lvania team on its first
offensive trip down the-ﬂoor. V S
'_Ron Rowan, headed ‘ to Notre
Dame on’ a basketball scholarship’,
fired a pass to Alexander,’ who was.
standing along the .lba_sel~ine‘ to the
right V of '-the key. As Alexander
squared himself for the shot, Ewing;

‘in. one great, sweeping ‘stride out
from the key, simply extend‘ed‘_his‘_

long willowy arm right over Alex-
ander’;/~head and placed his*3large-
palm on top of'the_ba'll. Alexander

‘was: frozen/,‘Tparalyzed,_as‘ he tried to ’ S

~wasn’,t merely satisfied to stay back

In tensity Puts BairdAmong
Top Settersin the‘East 

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pm NewsSpon5VVmer

When the Panther men’s volley-
ball team decided to. change its
offense to a 5-1 setup. it meant that

there would be only one setter in the.

lineup. Dave Baird, in his first sea-
son with Pitt, was given the nod for
the starting setter position halfway
through last season. Now, with a
year of experience, sophomore
Baird is considered one of Eastern

» Colleigate Volleyballs’s best setters.

“Without a doubt he’s the best in
the East.” said Pitt volleyball coach
Ray reilly. “Last season when we
changed to the 5-! , we elected to use
Dave as the lone setter. He’s tough.
and we have a great deal of success
with him in that position."

Baird. too. is pleased with playing
the 5-l offense becauseit eliminated

having to alternate setters through-‘

out the course of a match.
“Everyone gets used to thesame
person because you don’t have to

. make a lot of changes in the match,"

said Baird. “It also makes it easierto
take control. I think that it‘s easier
for one person to be in totalclontrol
than having only half of the"
responsibility.”

Baird was a highly-regarded
player while still in high school at
Steel Valley. As a senior he earned
All-State honors. but he decided to
take a year off before coming to
college. /

f‘I really didn”t know just what I \

wanted to come to school for. so I
decided to wait a year before making
the move to choose a college.“ said
Baird. ‘

In that year. Baird rarely played
organiyed \'0llL‘_\'l’)iIll. but he kept in
touch with the sport. He served asan
assistant coach at his high school.

and he played in pick-up games.

Despite the time off, Baird didn’t 

lose anything from that All—State
performance in his high school days.
Teammate Dave Mitas played
against Baird in the state volleyball
finals as a member ofthe Deer Lakes
championship‘ team. ’
“In that final match I learned that
he was certainly not aquitter." said
Mitas. “We‘beat them/soundly in
that final game. but he was the only
one on their team that never gave up

the whole night. He neverquitl

trying.” , _
Panther freshman Gary Groshner
considers Baird a top quality setter.
“I think that Dave is one of the
best setters in Eastern ball," said
Groshner. “He‘s able to keep everyb-
od=y loose during games?”

Baird. a team captain, has gained ‘

a good deal of volleyball knowledge
from coaches Reilly and Mike
Hebert. Reilly considers Baird to be
a competitive athlete and a tough
member of the squad to unseat.
“He‘s the most competitive guy on

the team; he hatesto lose and he lets .

everyone know it." said Reilly. “The
only thing that. hurts him is his
temperament on the court. lnlthis
sport you can‘t~let it show or let it
take control of you‘ during the

» game."

Baird has put that agressiyeness to
good use and has been a fundamen-
tal part of the Panthers‘ success this
season in the ECVI-‘s Division I. Pitt
is currently ranked third in the East
behind powerhouses Penn Stateland
Rutgers. A strong finish by_ Pitt
could possibly mean moving up into

I the No. 2 position,

“Our last tournament at New Jer-
sey was a stepping stone." said
Baird.. —“.\’S’s' hzid .21. .g0o.d .w<;c.kcnd

boosts us even higher. If we could
knock off Penn State or Rutgers and
continue the way that we have been
playing, we could possibly move up.
“We‘ve developed into a cohesive
unit, and that can pull us through
our matches successfully,” Baird
said. “We have the added asset ofthe
bench support this year. They have
done a great job in substituting all‘
season with Jim (Grant). Mike

PITTSBURGH AP—

Heavyweight Dennis Atiyeh reco-
vered from a 5-0 deficit and defeated
Andy Schwab in an I8-l7 decision
to giveithe Pennsylvania All-Stars a
22-19 victory over the USA All-
Stars in the Seventh Annual High
School Wrestling Classic Sunday.

With the score tied I9-I9 entering_
the final event, Atiyeh, of
Allentown-Dieruff. struggled back
to take a l7—l2 lead and hold on for
the one-point decision over his
Elmira, N.Y.. opponent.

John Worley of Red Land helped
set up the tie by handing Gilbert
Sanchez ofCheyenne, Wyo., his first
defeat in 53 matches with a I0-3
decision in the I05-pound class.

Atiyeh, the state champion heavy— ‘

weight who plans to attend the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh on a football

scholarship, said his latest victory,

before 6,2|2 spectators at the Civic
Arena, was his most satisfying.

“I won the state title for myself. I
won this for my state...and I was
able to do it in front of myjcoach.
That was the best feeling,” said

WinOverU.S.All-Stars

Atiyeh. who got a handshake after
the match by Pitt football Coach
Jackie Sherrill. ’ '

Ken Nellis of Shaler High School
was selected Pennsylvania's
outstanding wrestler for his ll-2
decision over Leo Bailey of Bixby,
OkIa., in the l38—pound match.

John Johnson, a I55—pounder

from Midwest City, Okla., was_

chosen as the USA team's outstand-
ing wrestler after he decisioned Matt
Haak of Cumberland Valley 21-6.

The Pennsylvania team holds a
4-2-I edge in the classic.

In the preliminary matches ear-
lier. Jim Dicker‘s 4-2 decision over

Mark Stivala in the I55-pound class .

was the margin of victory for a team

Ewing Draws Mixed Reviews
From Roundball Fans  

continued from page (en
entment. Ewing exited with only l2
points, but also pulled "down l2
rebounds, blockedi six shots and
added five steals.

A woman screamed he was too big
to be playing with the other kids.
“Its not fair,” she yelled. The,U.S.
team MVP trophy did little to
assuage Ewing’s torment as the fans
gathered around the bench and
shouted taunts at him after the game
had ended.

Such a reaction isn’t new. Other

players of Ewing’s size and stature‘

have had to deal with thexsame kind

of attitudes and expectations that
Ewing arouses in fans. Virginia’s 7-
foot-4 giant, Ralph Sampson, often
laments the fact that people put all
the fame and all the blame on his

. shoulders. ‘‘I’m not no team,"Samp-

Grgdrich   Quiet‘
On Pittsburgh

Former Pitt basketball coach Tim
Grgurich was in attendance Friday
night at the Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic on a recruiting mission.
Grgurich, now an assistant coach at
Nevada-Las Vegas under head man
Jerry Tarkanian, who was also at the
game, were watching United States
All-Star team member Anthony
Jones, whom they are reportedly
recruiting. .

Grgurich declined to comment on«

his first year at Las Vegas or his
feelings upon returning to Pitts-
burgh. “We have a policy at Nevada,
only the head coach is allowed to
talk to the press,” Grgurich said.

.Millen Keys Pens Playoff flopesiﬁ

The Pittsburgh Penguins chances‘

of creating havoc in the upcoming
Stanley Cup Playoffs rest on the not
so broad shoulders of goaltender
Greg Millen according to team cap-
tain Randy Carlyle.

-“A lot of teams in the playoffs are
there because of a hot goaltender,
Mike Liut in St. Louis, Tony Espo—
sito in Chicago, Rogie Vachon in
Boston, and hopefully Greg Millen
in Pittsburgh,” said Carlyle.

Carlyle added, “Tony Esposito
has kept Chicago inilcontention all

year. It's not because Chicago has

such an overpowering team, it’s

The quickest way to get  

An emergency stop for repairs can
wipe out even the best-heeled traveler. —
Luckily, al-1 you need is the price of a'
phone call to get you the money before
your car gets off the lift., Here’s what to

- do when you need money in a hurry. ‘

1I'Ca1l home. Report the situation, and

tell the folks they can get emergency
cash to you fast by phone.

2 I Ask them  call Western Union’s
toll—free number, 800-325-6000 (in

Missouri, 800-342-6700), anytime, day or

night. They charge the money and the
service fee to their .MasterCard* or

Q

VISAT card. A Western Union Charge-

Card Money Order, up to $1,000, will be_

ﬂashed to the Western Union office or ‘
agent nearest your emergency.

3: Pick up your money——u_sually' within
two hours+—at the local Western Union '
office or agent; There are 8,500
nationally, except in Alaska.
_ Conveniently, about 900 locations are

open 24 hours. It’s that easy.

Be sure to remind your parents about.
our toll-free_ number. It’s all they need to
call Western Union to the rescue.
