Illegal bus companies
take students for a ride

Byjohn Temple
Staff Writer

Campus police are investigating
bus companies that have been
offering students illegal low—fare
trips and occasionally stiffing
them.

“Several students haven’t
received full service from these
companies,” said Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary

Moses, “One student was left

. stranded in Lancaster.”

Bus companies are supposed to
be licensed with the Public Utility
Commission, but illegal compa-
nies advertise on flyers when
vacations or term breaks
approach. I

“Students should check the
companies out either through the
Public Safety Department or the
PUC,” Moses said.

In addition to the films

Movies made by non-
film students are also
being sought. Amateur

are acceptable and
encouraged.

“Most of the films we
receive are student coine-
dies,” Lewis said.

When asked about cen-

all of the films are

they’ haven’t refused one
yet. "Some are pretty per-

Student artwork other
than films will also be dis-

Roberts: student president,
student, mother of three

By Holly Affeltranger
Staﬂ‘ Writer

She is a mother of three, a
wife, a horse trainer, a full—time
student and has been the CGS
Student Government Board pres-
ident for the last two terms.

Marcie Roberts is a woman
always on the go.

“I don’t have a magic formula,
and I am not superwoman,”
Roberts said. “I just thrive on
being busy.”

At the age of 27 she enrolled at
Pitt in the summer of 1987. At
that time, she was pregnant with
her third child.

“I carried nine credits my first
semester,” Roberts said. “Icon-
veniently had my child between
semesters and then went back in
the fall and carried six more
credits.”

For these first two semesters,
Roberts took her classes through
the external studies program at
Pitt-Greensburg. Since this CGS
program has only one workshop
a month, the majority of class-

work is done at home.

Presently she is in her last
semester before graduation.

“I will be glad to be done with
this part of school,” Roberts said.
“I have been pretty much a con-
stant student.”

It has been hard for Roberts to
do all this in the last six years.
She says the personal costs have
been staggering.

“I have made the choice of
coming here for a midterm or
staying home with a sick child,”
she said. “It has been hard and I
have paid the price dearly.”

In the past, Roberts has been
involved with many groups.
Between 1989 and 1991 she was
vice president and president of
Lambda Alpha Epsilon, the
American Criminal Justice
Association. LAE is supported by
the CGS Student Government,
and Roberts made a progression
to council.

Roberts was elected president
of CGS Student Government in
April of 1991. She was then re-

Sorber leaves Pitt engmeemgfor T exas

By Julie Holaren
Staff Writer

Engineering Dean Charles A.
Sorber has decided it’s time to
move on.

Sorber, who is leaving Pitt
after this semester to take over
the presidency of a Texas col-
lege, knew when he began his
seven-year stint at Pitt that this
position would not be his final
career move.

“I believe that it’s healthy for
change in administrative posi-
tions,” he said. “When I came
here I made it known to the fac-
ulty and to the administration
that I didn’t really expect to stay
longer than eight or 10 years.”

He came to Pitt from the
University of Texas at Austin,
where he was associate dean in
the College of Engineering, at a
time when Pitt’s faculty morale

' was low. Sorber said that there

seemed to be inequities among
allocations and resources, as
well as a lack of communication
in the Engineering School.
Sorber tried to utilize team-
work to bring the Engineering
School to where it is today.
Now, over 25 percent of the
students receive scholarships
from the Engineering School, an
estimated $350,000 worth. The

Grad students
dare to share
food drives,
volunteerism

By Kathy Kmiecik
For T be Pitt News

Local graduate students are
finding time to share with the
hungry and needy people in
Pittsburgh by participating in
Dare to Share 1993.

The program, which
involves a food drive and vol-
unteering at local soup
kitchens, is comprised of
graduate business students
from the _ University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon
and Duquesne Universities.

The schools wanted to
come together in a way that
would benefit the community,
and from that idea came Dare
to Share.

The event was totally
planned by graduate students
from the three schools in
cooperation with the
Salvation Army. On March 9,
city councilmember Dan
O’Connor recognized April 4
as Dare to Share day in
Pittsburgh. Representatives of
each of the three schools
were there to receive the res-
olution.

Students are collecting non-
perishable food on campus as
well as volunteering at local
soup kitchens. They are also
contacting alumni and local

‘businesses for donations to

purchase perishable goods.
On April 4, the Salvation
Army will provide trucks that
will drive to each school and
Seenruc, page 6

laboratories have been modem-
ized, primarily through outside
donations and a Study
Equipment Grant Program,
making Pitt more competitive in
research.

Furthermore, Pitt awarded 38
Ph.D.s last year, doubling the
figures prior to Sorbefs arrival.

“It’s nothing that I did alone,”
he said. “What we have here
now is a team effort that has
resulted in some solid progress.”

As well as being dean, he is
also the president of the Water
Environment Federation, a
40,000 volunteer association for-
merly known as the Water
Pollution Control Federation.

He became a member in 1965
while he was a graduate student
studying sanitary engineering at
Penn State. Three years ago, he
was asked to go through the
chains of the executive board, a
four-year process serving as vice
president, president-elect, presi-
dent and immediate past presi-
dent.

Being an officer has taken
him to such places as Singapore,
Sweden, Hong Kong and many
other countries. ‘

“It’s a lot of fun, a challenge
and a lot of travelling,” he said.
“It requires considerable effort,
but there’s a lot of satisfaction in

working with folks who have
common professional interests.”

Sorber also served in the
Army of Medical Service Corps
almost continuously from 1961
to 1975, obtaining his Ph.D. dur-
ing the same years.

He left the military to enter
the world of academics, some-
thing he thought he’d never do.
His father had been an English
teacher in northeastern
Pennsylvania, and that is where
he spent his childhood.

“I wasn’t overly impressed
with the fact that he had to
work every summer painting
houses and the winter selling
insurance, or whatever it took to
make ends meet,” he said.

His father did this to support
his wife and five children,
Sorber being the oldest.

He has gone far and beyond
teaching and will soon be leav-
ing Pitt to his new position.
He’ll pack up and take with him
his coffee mugs, which decorate
his office. The collection started
many years ago as a joke that
just kept growing.

He will also take his three
plastic college football helmets
given to him at the Alabama
Water Environment Federation
meeting. All three helmets rep-

P192’ Beta Kappa boners Pitt students, chancellor

Sixty-three Pitt juniors
and seniors, along with
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor and Pitt Professor
Andrew J. Strathern, will be
initiated into Phi Beta
Kappa national honor soci-

Sabloff said he is

large number of Pitt stu-

year; only 49 students were
chosen for initiation last

inflation.

WHEN THE GAME IS OVER,
WHO WINS?

Love. What does it mean? Just a one-night roman-
tic encounter with the "perfect” partner. Perhaps a
warm, mushy feeling that wells up inside of you when
you see that shapely blond girl walking across campus-
the fireworks that go off in you when you finally meet
Mr. Right.

I propose to you that love is not these things, but
that love is a commitment. Anyone can have a warm and
mushy feeling at 20, but what happens when the ”girl" is
65, and not so blond and not so shapely? Love at 65 is a
commitment, a commitment to be faithful, to sacrifice,
regardless of looks, regardless of physical appearances,
regardless of how one feels. Love, when you get right
down to it, has to be something that transcends the effects
of time. ”Hey, haven't I heard that somewhere before?”

"But now there is faith, hope, and g>_v_e, and the ‘
greatest of these is love.” Sounds good. Love will always
be around. But who is the author of love? Is it an idea
someone in the 20th century invented? I think not! Did
someone on the par of Copernicus chart love in his primi-
tive 16th century laboratory? No way. We need to go
back to the beginning of time to find the author of love.
God instilled in Adam and Eve His ability to love, to
wholly commit oneself to another. This is how man is
made in God's own image. Thisis how man loves.

When you think about it, God knew how to love. He
gave up something that was very important to Him in
order for others to know His love. He gave up His Son,
His only Son. He gave Him up to suffering, to persecu-
tion, to death. This is true love. This is what true com-
mitment is all about; sacrificing what you want in favor
of what is best for someone else.

That is what God has done. He gave His Son so that
you would know that God is committed to you. He is
committed to having you know Him, yet He gives you a
choice to love Him or not. You say: ”it’s too difficult to
change", later, I'm too busy now"; God still loves you and
He weeps for you... .

Don't try to love without knowing Him who created
love. He loved you first, and He wants you to know the
love He has for you now. If you are looking for stature,
success, happiness or money, you are wasting your life.
This is truth that transcends all “time: Seek love first, seek -.
God first, and you will have what counts once the game
15 over.

elected for a second term last
year.

“It was far more remarkable
than I expected it to be,” Roberts
said. “I really had an opportunity
to explore the needs, services
and concerns of non-traditional
students.”

The experience of being presi-
dent has changed Roberts’ origi-
nal plans for after graduation.
With her bachelor’s degree in
legal studies, she planned to go
into law school, but now that
plan is uncertain.

“By working through the uni-
versity in an administrative
capacity, I found I really enjoy
taking an organization, looking
at it and trying to determine how
effective your organization is,”
Roberts said.

The opportunity to work with
proposals, programs and organi-
zations has increased her interest
in public administration.

“I like to be the person to
make changes happen,” Roberts
said. “That’s where I get my
kicks."

Even though she has done
much with these groups, she
does not consider herself to be a
“joiner.”

“I was not a person who could
commit unless I knew I could
mold it to the way I wanted it,”
she said.

If not for the. flexibility of the
CGS Student Government office,
Roberts said she would not have
been able to be its president.

“That is the beauty of this
office in representing these non-
traditional students,” Roberts
said. “It is all about flexibility.”

Roberts said the most difficult
aspect of being president was
when you must weigh the good
of the entire community vs. what
the student perceives as bad for
him or herself. '

“You are in this situation
where you are weighing these
two interests, and on top of that
somewhere, ﬂoating in the mid-
dle, is yourself,” Roberts said.
“Any leader on campus is going
to experience that.”

Even though some decisions
were hard, Roberts said she
believes recent changes in coun-
cil have been good ones. One
change is that CGS Student
Government has become more
visible within the university.

“We have set a mark here,”
she said. “We are really focusing
on a broader spectrum for non-
traditional students.”

Roberts has a different life out-
side of Pitt. She and her husband
Bob have a 150-acre farm where
she trains horses.

Pitt representative Frank

“We had a great response,”

Freshmen Council President
Todd Neufeld thanked several
board members for working
with their student interns
throughout the year but criti-
cized others for “untapped
resources that are going to
waste.” .

The intern program matches
first-year students interested in

learning the workings of stu-
dent government with current
members of the board.

Neufeld said that some of the
board members have not been
working with their interns, and

that being active as an intern

gives students invaluable expe-
rience.

“Interns should be more
effective student government
members,” he said. “They
know the ropes, and they’ve
had hands-on experience.”

Neufeld said that while some
interns have been working out
very well, others have not.

“In some cases it’s working
great, because the individuals
just mesh,” he said. “And in
some cases, the ‘interns have
changed their minds, they
aren’t interested.”

“My interns did excellent

work this term,” board member
Brian Bolton said
Board member Tara

Munkatchy, who was an SGB
intern last year, questioned
how many times the board
member was responsible for
repeatedly trying to get in
touch with the interns.

The intern program is in its
second year, and board mem-
bers and Neufeld agreed that
there are still some snags to be
worked out.

Cartoon hysteria

Recently, several newspapers from around the country announced that
they would not mm a ﬁve-week series of the comic strip “For Better or For
Worse.” The comic, which is 14 years old and has a nardership of 14,000
people, has been nixed because the subject matter concerns homosexuality.

Thomas Mitchell, editor of the Ins Vegas Retriewjozrmal, said his paper is
not running the series because it  was condoning homosexuality almost
to the point of advocacy.” His statements are ludicrous. Advocacy of homo-
sexuality and the acceptance that it exists are two entirely dilferent things.

There is a growing trend in this nation toward forced morality. Right-wing
leaders, such as the two Pat's — Robertson and Buchanan, have expressed
an interest toward returning to the traditional values of the 19505. Back then,
there was no talk of homosexual rights. And black Americans were denied
the rights that many of their fellow countrymen enjoyed

But believing that homosexuality is wrong is not a crime in itself. Nor is it
wrong to “advocate it.” Religions and cultures all over the world teach
against homosexuality, just as many accept it. However, as quickly as we
scream tolerance of homosexuality so must we accept the teachings of these
religions.

Likewise, the far left has been equally guilty.  like Adrienne
Rich have condemned mainstream Arnerica’s thinking and tried to force its
brand of morality, as the only way to achieve equality for many homosexu-
als. ‘

The question, however, is one of choice. For newspapers to censor this
comic strip denies its readers the opportunity to decide for themselves if
they should raid it. The medium of print is not advocacy as Mitchell sug-
gests. It brings to light the fact that homosexuality exists and that the
American public will have to (1311 with it. Like a weighed-down pressure
cooker, censorship and suppression cause deeper and more disruptive
eruptions.

The creator of the comic strip, Lynn Johnson, is simply trying to provide a
forum in which to express her opinions Other writers and artists may do the
same. But the key here is dialogue, and until both sides of the issue realize
this we are destined to live our lives in fear ofone another.

Thank you Mr. Stone

Two days ago controversial ﬁlm director and producer Oliver Stone
spoke at the William Pitt Union Assembly Room in front of a sold—out audi-
ence. The Oscar-winning director, former teacher and Vretnarn veteran, best
known for his ﬁlms JFK, Platoon and Wall Street, had an important mes-
sage for those who were there to listen.

During Stone's discourse he spoke of his movies — but not for their
entertainment value. His message was like the beginning of Dickens’ Tale of
Two Cities, it was one of hope and despair: “It was [about] the age of foolish-
nas, it was the epoch of belief.”

The foolishness that Stone spoke of was the failure of Americans — and
for that matter humankind — to question the powers that be. A failure of
Americans to recognize the cornerstone of Western thought he did not try to
paint his movies as the absolute truth. In fact, it was quite the contrary. In his
discussion about the film JFK. he asserted that he had no answers, just sev-
eral questions that were worthy of response. Unless the public realizes that
“power corrupts,” said Stone, freedom will remain but an empty idei.

Stone’s message of doubt was matched by a seemingly contradictory dic-
tum of faith, or as Dickens put it —— belief. He talked of a higher essence and
of mankind’s kindred spirituality. Human beings must love their Earth, for it,
above all, has provided mankind with shelter and food Stone spoke of
Indians who pierce themselves with arrows and of 100,000 Buddhist monks
meditating in a human chain. ‘

Faith, as well as doubt, can conquer the establishment. We do not con-
done overthrowing the establishment, but Stone’s ultimate message was an
important one. In Tahiti, the military tried to overthrow the government. It
was those monks, and the faith of Buddhism, which denied this usurpation
of power. In other words, Stone said, it was the strength of the people that
overcame adversity. In an otherwise cynical speech, the message of hope
was one worth hearing.

The NRA should stand up and ﬁght

n response to the anti—NRA

article by Cameron Harvey,

I have just a few things to
say. I support the NRA and every-
thing it stands for. We live in a soci-
ety today where if you are willing
to risk a small jail term, you can
arm yourself with awesome ﬁre-
power. Most policemen only carry
a six- or nine-shot pistol. I would
feel much safer going up against an
assailant with my Ruger 10/22 with

’ a 30—round clip rather than wait ﬁve

or more minutes for the police to
arrive with a pistol.

Rather than ban the weapons
that criminals have easy access to,
maybe we (as the public) should
take up arms and defend ourselves

_with the same weapons used

against us. I realize the implications
of this, but using the same theory
as Cameron, if it can save one life, it
is worth it.

I can’t say that I would stand
behind all of this, but I can say that
it contains a considerable amount
of reality that most people choose
not to acknowledge. I do think that
without the NRA we as citizens
could lose some of our basic rights.
I do agree with checking into one’s
background before s/he is allowed
to buy a weapon, but banning
weapons from the public only
gives the  an easier ﬁght.

Open forum requested

I challenge Reverend George

Polzer to a public debate in regard
to their views (on) Native-
American spirituality. I would like
for us to appear in a college setting
that favors freedom of discussion. I
would agree to leave the lectem if
the audience should interrupt the
discussion or become urrmannerly
or disruptive in any form. Either of
us would be free to leave should
the opposite side also exhibit
behavior unacceptable toward
rational, ethical debate. I am an
enrolled Ogala Sioux, OST 15287,

Elle Speales. My God is Wakan
Tanka, the Creator and Great
Mystery.

I am an environmentalist. My
belief is that this recent awakening
could lead toward planetary salva-
tion. This is my supposition and is
open for agreement or disagree-
ment. I do not desire that the
Catholic church be destroyed,
although it appears that it is headed
on its own path of self—destruction.
An open discussion could help the‘
church become aware what is
environmentally and spiritually
happening throughout the globe.
But that is the nature of debates.
Hopefully, the three of us cam stand
up and respond in an open forum.

Satanic worries

The report in T uesday’s March ,

23, 1993 edition of The Pitt News
about the “Male student raped near
campus” is cause for active alarm.
Two men raping a male in a “mug-
ging” scenario near campus and
then the victim “not able to give
descriptions” can be a satanic cult
gang assault with continuing threat
of retaliation if the victim identifies
the attackers to the authorities.
First, rape of a male is a satanic ritu-
al method. Second, the fearfulness
— which may be the rerson for the
victim’s lack of description of the
muggers — is the usual result of a
child abusers threat to the victim
insuring the victim does not tell
his/her story parents about the

» abuse.

Thus, my hypothesis of this
event being conducted by a satanic
cult gang — although on very little
evidence of such — leads to the
alarm that a dead serious investiga-

tion and explicit alarm about a cult
gang should be launched now
before mutilated bodies are found
near Heinz Chapel. I envision this
from reading the book The
Ultimate Evil.

I wanted to respond to the full-
page ad that Planned Parenth‘oo‘d
took out in a national paper. The ad
started out reading: “They shot him
lDr. Gunnl in the back because 
The ad went on to lie about prolif-
ers and support their own mtu'der—

tion industry.

Simply, there was no conspiracy.
There was only Michael Griffin.
There was no "Ihey.” These radical.
anti—family, anti—child, anti—men.
feminists are much too eager to
implicate the entire pro-life move-
ment with Mr. Grifrin.

Of course, leave it also to the
pinko—commie editors of The Pitt
News to put something equally as

stupid in their piece: “Gunn Killing“ ‘

(3/16/93). They label Mr. Griffin as
“an activist advocate” of the pro—life
movement How about a nut’ How
about a madman’ A crackpot’ The
editors of [The Pitt] News are making
the same moronic implication that
Plzmned Parenthood did. EL?[')«’j)i‘()-
life ﬁiend I know is a compassion-
ate, rational person dedicated to
family and life.

lastly, I want to beg all you pro-
abortion people to stop saying pro
lifers approve of the killing of Gunn.
Mr. Terry of Operation Rescue is not
at all being contradictory. He con-
demns the killing of Dr. Gurm and

. the killing of the innocent babies Dr.

Gunn would murder for proﬁt by
abortion The way to stop monaers
like Dr. Gurm is by laws and con-
vincing, not by gunshots. The way
to stop monsters like Michael
Griffin is imprisonment.

P.S. It’s not the death penalty for
Griffin. That, too, is murder.

When Johnny Majors first stepped
on the Pitt campus in 1972 he had
with him a fleet-footed jewel of a
running back that glistened in the
autumn sun.

As he makes his way back to Pitt
Stadium after an extended hiatus in
Knoxville, Majors finds himself with a
five-sided stone from which the foun-
dation of a return to glory might be
laid.

With five lettermen returning in the
backfield the recently re-hired head
coach has the luxury of five quality
backs —— with a bruising convert
included. I

The five — Tim Colicchio, Curtis
Martin, Vince Williams, Chad Dukes
and Jermaine Williams + bring the
offense a valuable combination of
skill, speed and power.

“We’re all a family,” converted full-
back Vince Williams said. “If I« go
down, I expect Curt to come up. If
Curt goes down, I want to be right
there to back him up, even Jermaine
or Timmy, any of them.”

Noneenter spring workout with a
leg up on the starting job, and all,
injured Vince Williams included, are
prepared to vault into the limelight.

Due to the new administration at
Pitt Stadium, virtually none of the
coaches knows anything of his play-
ers. Running backs coach Charlie Coe
entered workouts without even
watching a video of his backs.

“I came in herewith an open
mind,” Coe said. ‘‘I don’t know what
these guys did last year, so I have no
preconceived notion on any of them.
I want to give them a fair opportunity
before I have to judge them on the
football field.” _

The situation seems perfect for
each back to get a fair run at the job.
The whole staff is new, and the
offense, freshly imported from the
University of Tennessee, is waiting to
be tuned up. Majors and offensive
coordinators Coe (running game) and
former NFL quarterback Ken Karcher
(passing game) bring in a newly
styled system that has the Panthers

raving. -

“It’s a basic offense, but it’s real
complex,” wide receiver Curtis
Anderson said. “Last year was more
pro style, but this is a more college-
oriented offense,” with single-back,

Williams finds new place in

Panther backfield puzzle

By Rob Pugliese
Sports Assistant

For all of its individual talent, the
Pitt backfield picture remains largely
a giant puzzle, one that will likely
stay that way until after fall camp
begins.

But the Panthers may have found
themselves a missing piece to that
puzzle, or actually, may have just

Matt

CW8

Vince Williams is all smiles about his move to tailback for the 1993 season.

found the proper fit for that piece.

Until the fall, however, Vince
Williams will remain the mystery
man in Pitt’s backfield scheme.

The 6—foot 2-inch, 215-pound red-
shirt sophomore has yet to truly find
his niche in the Panther backfield.
Williams came to Pitt as an all-state
tailback out of Lynchburg, Va.’s E.C.
Glass High School. During his first
season an injury to Ronald Redmon
at an already-thin fullback spot

Williams to fullback.

“In the old system, if you were
over 210, you were a fullback. I was
just struggling at that position,”
Williams said. ,

Last season, Williams saw action in

« four games at the fullback spot, car-

rying the football 3O times for 94
yards and a touchdown. That was
until Oct. 5 when he ruptured his
right Achilles’ tendon, ending his
season prematurely. Ironically,
Williams could have received play-
ing time at tailback when injuries to
Curtis Martin and Jermaine Williams
wrecked Pitt’s depth there. Just as he
was to move back to his natural
position, Vince Williams was lost for
the season with the injured tendon.

Now Williams is hungry for fall
camp to begin, eager to show his
skills to the new coaching staff and
prove that he can produce effective-
ly as a tailback. Williams is not par-
ticipating in spring drills as a pre-
cautionary measure. He decided to

‘hold off until fall camp, only to

ensure complete recovery. His reha-
bilitation has progressed as expect-
ed. Williams began running last
week and said he is already looking
forward to the fall.

“People haven’t seen me playing
tailback,” Williams said. “They really
haven’t seen the speed I have, and
my running style is kind of punish-
ing. The plays they have — I’m tick-
led to death because they’re power
plays.” 4

Williams said there was no tempta-
tion to rush back for spring drills in
an effort to impressthe new coach-

ing staff.

Royster speaks out on his lack of a future with Pitt footbaﬂ

By Mike Johns
Staff Writer

Since Johnny Majors took
over as head football coach
for the Pitt Panthers, the
catchy new
phrase has
been “back
to the
future.”
For junior
Marcus Royster it has been,
“Don't come back — you
have no future.” .

Royster has been given
the death penalty by
Majors. He was kicked off
the football team forever.
Royster is no longer a mem-
ber of the team and his
scholarship is up at the end

 

of the this term.

Royster was a junior col-
lege All-American and was
highly touted as a quick-fix
for the-defensive line due to
the departures of superstars
Sean Gilbert and Keith
Hamilton.

In the ‘92 season, Royster
did not play and was red-
shirted, which would have
enabled him to have two
more years of eligibility.

“Marcus possesses great
strength and straight-ahead
speed for a man his size,”
defensive line coach Tom
Turchetta said. “His biggest
hurdle right now is learning
the defensive system. If he
can master that during fall
camp he should be a very

productive player for us.”
Royster, in an earlier
interview with The Pitt

News, said he was ready to‘

come in and show the fans
what he can do. Despite his
coaches’ high "assessment of
Royster, his own assessment
of himself and a defensive
line that would not be con-
fused with the Steel Curtain,
Royster did noteven get
one chance to fail or suc-
ceed on the field.

In an interview with The
Pitt News Royster speaks on
why he went home for
Christmas break, why he
had to run punishment
workouts and why he got
banned from the Pitt foot-
ball team for life. With the

exception of brief initial
statements, Pitt’s football
coaches refused comment
on _the issue of Royster’
dismissal. A '
Pitt News: Can you tell me
why you got kicked off the
football team permanently?
Marcus Royster: My
understanding of it is I vio-
lated team rules.‘That is
what they told me. I violat-
ed the rules by missing a 5
a.m. punishment workout.
PN: Why were you given a
5 a.m. "morning punishment
workout?

MR: I went home for
Christmas break to see my
mother who lives in
California. ‘Me and my
mother are very close, and

since I was playing football
for the team I never got to
go home for many months
to see my mother.

I didn’t really have the
money to get back to Pitt
and I was a week late in
getting here. I missed about
a week of winter condition-
ing because of that. So as a
result for being late for win-
ter conditioning, I had to do
some workouts at 5 a.m. in
the morning as a punish-
ment.

Some people might say‘

“well if he didn’t have the
money to get home and
back on time well he
should of stayed in
Pittsburgh.” But it was

Defense is a part of the
Pens’ winning formula

While it’s true that Mario Lemieux has been scoring
at an astronomical pace and the Pens have four play-
ers who may topple the 100—point plateau, the
Penguins’ defense is one of the main reasons they cap-
tured the Patrick Division and are the NHL’s best team.

The Penguins are third in the league in team
defense, allowing 242 goals (only Chicago and
Toronto have surrendered fewer goals). While Tom
Barrasso is the primary reason for the lack of goals
against, the Penguins blueliners have contributed sig-

nificantly.
Jirn Clark

Now with the acquisition of Mike Ramsey and Peter
Taglianetti, the defense has become only stronger.

Now Pittsburgh has eight NHL—caliber defensemen.
Larry Murphy should be a strong candidate for the
Norris Trophy. He has 18 goals and nearly 80 points
while compiling a plus/minus rating of over 20. The
man who made Paul Coffey expendable has run the
Penguins’ power play from the point all season. He
also continues to play a smart, positional game.

Then there’s Ulf Samuelsson, one of the meanest
players to ever come from Sweden. He has hit, fought
and annoyed all year, compiling a plus/minus rating

_ T racks Crumpler; Mcm'ozm' come bade strong

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Pitt seniors Ronise Crumpler and Carmela
Mariani came off injuries to build on the steady
progress of the Pitt women’s track team at the
Alabama Relays, the first meet of the outdoor
season.

Mariani, who recently recovered from a leg
injury, took first place in the 10,000—meter run
and qualified for the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Championships. She was Division I
All—American in the 10,000 meter last year.

“Both Mariani and Crumpler are not near
their top performance yet,” “Pitt track head
coach Steve Lewis said. “The good news is that
they are well on their way.”

Crumpler placed third in the 400-meter run,
qualifying for ECACS in that event. She
anchored the sprint medley relay (Tanya
Mullins, Allison Williams, Kim Blair, Crumpler)
which set a mark of 144.60 seconds to set a Pitt
record. Crumpler also contributed to the 4 x
100 relay (Williams, Mullins, Blair and
Crumpler) and the 4 x 400 relay (Williams,
Crumpler, Blair and Hockaday), which fin-
ished sixth and seventh place, respectively. All
three relay teams qualified for ECACS.

“Our relay teams are very strong,” Lewis
said. “A big part of that is Hockaday. She has
been a steady performer for the past two
years.”

In addition to the 4 x 400 relay, Hockaday
ran in the 4 x 800 relay (Hockaday, Ayne
Allen, Natasha Van Reil and Tonia Malloy),
which finished in second place with an ECAC
berth. She also took seventh place in the 400-

meter run.

“Monica has been our rock,” Lewis said.
“When she shows up, we win.”

Blair and Williams, who were successful per-
formers for Pitt during the indoor season, had
successful events individually as well as on
relay teams. In addition to the relays above,
they finished second in the shuttle hurdle relay
(Mullins, Staci Suggs, Blair and Williams). Blair
received an ECAC bid for her third-place finish
in the 400-meter hurdle. Williams, recently
named All-American in the 55—meter hurdle,
took seventh place and qualified for ECACS in
the 400—meter hurdle. She finished third in the
100-meter hurdles and earned a trip to the
NCAA divisional qualifiers in that event.

“Allison was right on time,” Lewis said. “She
is where we want her to be.”

Katina Miles qualified for ECACS with her

second—place finish in the heptathlon. First- A

year student Najuma Fletcher, who set several
Pitt records during the indoor season, finished
seventh“ in the event before leaving the meet
due to sickness.

“Najuma will not be practicing this week,”
Lewis said. ‘‘Hopefully she will only miss one
meet.”

Another first-year student, Malloy, took sixth
place in the 800—meter run.

“I think the meet went extremely well,”
Lewis said. “We’re planning to get a lot better,
starting with this weekend. We will be taking a
few of our athletes in hopes of refining their
performances.”

The next meet will be this Saturday at the
University of Miami—Florida, where Pitt will
compete in the Gatorade Invitational.

Christmas and I just wanted
to be home with my family
for the holiday.

What college kid wants to
stay on campus during
Christmas break when they
could be home with their
family?

PN: Do you feel that getting
the “Death Penalty” for miss-
ing three punishment work-
outs is unfair?

MR: Yes, I certainly do-
because if they kicked every-
one off the team who missed
more than three 5 a.m. pun-
ishment workouts there
would certainly be more
players kicked permanently
off the football team.

I know players who missed

six to nine 5 a.m. punish-
ment workouts and they are
still on the team.
PN: Why did you miss three
5 a.m. punishment workouts?
MR: I missed my first 5 a.m.
punishment workout because
I had to go and pay a fine.

The next one I just missed.
And the third one I had
worked out in team condi-
tioning really hard the day
before and that morning I
was really cramped up and I
couldn’t run. .

before I missed my third 5

a.m. punishment workout I
worked out with the team,
and later on that evening I
did some running on my
own. That next morning, like
I said, I just was really
cramped up. I really could
not run for my 5 a.m. punish-
ment workout.

PN: Is it true that you want-
ed out of your scholarship at
Pitt and the university made
it easy for you to transfer to
another school?

MR: Certainly not. I am a
junior college transfer player
and I only have two more
years to play major college
football.

If I transferred to another
Division I-A school I would
have to sit out for a
year and only have one year
of eligibility left.

Besides, no Division I-A
school is going to give a
player a scholarship for only
one year.

I could transfer to a
Division II or III school and
be eligible in the fall. IfI
wanted to go to a Division II
or III school I would of done
so and never have come to
Pitt.

Pitt is the place were I
would love to receive my
degree and play football at.

of, but he has still played
strong. He’s dented the net
four times while compiling
12 assists and 21 plus rating.
And on the outside look-
ing in is Grant Jennings.
Jennings’ contributions to
the team have been over-
looked almost ever since he
got here, but he has played
well recently, when he’s not
scratched. His play Sunday
was exceptional, and for the
season he is a plus player.
Newcom—ers Ramsey and
Taglianetti give the Penguins
solid depth. Ramsey was the
captain of the Sabres and
he’s_ one of the best shot-

blockers in the game while
Taglianetti has played
exceptional hockey since his
return to Pittsburgh.
Taglianetti racked up two
assists against the Bruins
Sunday and he’s been hitting
opponents with a passion.

SO the saying that defense
wins championships comes
true. When the Pens tight-
ened up on the blueline in
the last two playoffs, they
won. Now you’re seeing
what they can do when they
play solid defense all year
long.

“They might be pleased,
but I won‘t be pleased until

I’m 110 percent,” he said.
During the winter,
Williams went to new run-
ning backs coach Charlie
Coe with his request to move
back to tailback, a place
where Williams feels much

more comfortable and confi- _

dent.

“When I asked, ‘Can I play
that spot?,’ [Coe] didn’t even
hesitate. He was like, ‘sure,
just be ready when fall camp

. comes, because the best peo-

ple are gonna play.’ And
that’s basically all I needed
to hear anyway -— the best
people are gonna play.
That’s what it’s all about,”
Williams said.

To Williams, the switch
represents the chance of a
lifetime -— a chance to con-
tribute from a position he
loves to play. Williams
expressed enthusiasm for the
new offensive scheme,
which could even include
versatile sets such as the
Wishbone and Power I as
well as one back sets. More
than anything, Williams
stressed his confidence in
Coe and looked ahead to
August.

“As he told me, the best
people will play, and that’s
what I like,” Williams said.
“You can’t ask for anything
better than that.”

them,” Coe said. “Simplicity
is whatever you can teach.
We feel like if we can teach
it and they can learn it then
we will do very well.”

Martin, a two—year letter-
man, returns as a big brother
of The Family. But the former
member of the 1991 Big East
all—rookie team entered camp
with a small limp and a need
for answers to questions that
followed him around last
season’s 750-yard perfor-
mance.

“Curtis looks fine,”Coe
said. “He’s not 100 percent
—- he has a little ankle injury,
a little nagging bruise — but
he’s playing and practicing,
and that’s what we’ve got to
have.”

Martin, however, is some-
what uncertain of his imme-

diate future in the revamped
Panther offense.

“I’m not sure what my role
will be because there’s no
one who’s got a starting posi-
tion right now,” Martin said.

Besides carrying the rush-
ing load in 1991, Martin also
saw time catching passes in
the flat and in short—yardage
situations. While this will not
drastically change, Coe
stresses that the routes for
the tailbacks will be different
this season.

“We do have [deep routes]
in [the playbook] for them,
but they don’t have a lot of
routes to run right now,” Coe
said.

Martin’s main competition
for the starting tailback spot
will be junior Tim Colicchio.

ed eight games last year in

Martin’s stead. amassing a
total of 743 yards on 159 car-
ries.

“Last year we didn’t con-
centrate on being versatile
backs,” Colicchio said. “This
year it’s a lot more focused
on that, a lot more pass
routes. The back is now
focused a lot more into the
passing game than usual.”

The competition between
the two front-runners is
being taken extremely seri-
ous between the two backs.

“There’s always going to be
competition between me,
Curtis, Jermaine and Chad,”
he said. “We’re all good
backs. It just depends on
who’s healthy. As long as
everybody’s healthy, there’s
a great race going on.”

“Being that it’s so competi-
tive makes us work extra

hard on the field,” Martin
said.

But through all the prob-
lems of spring camp — unfa-
miliarity with coaches and
staff, Vince Williams’ torn
Achilles’ tendon and the
uncertainty of the roster —
the Panthers continue what

pleasant surprise — attitude.

“There’s more intensity
during practice,” Martin said.
“Everybody’s hustling and
getting from place to place. If
there’s a mistake, they’re cor-
recting it and everything is in
a positive direction.”
