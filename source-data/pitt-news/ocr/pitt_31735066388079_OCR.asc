Additional study to further delay bus lane

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Due to a study on safety, pollution and
road conditions, recommended by
Allegheny County Commissioner Peter
Flaherty, the return of the Fifth Avenue
bus lane will experience another delay.

According to Richard St. John, Executive
Director of Oakland Directions Inc., the
delay was previously due to “troubles in
getting the bus lane railings fabricated.
[The bus lane] wouldn’t be reopened until
the railings were in place or [until] a
combination of permanent and temporary

guards were in place along Fifth Avenue” ,

St. John noted at an O.D.I. meeting held

“Commissioner Flaherty contacted Bill
Millar, director of Port Authority and [said
that] one of the major funders of Port
Authority [recommended] that the bus
lane shouldn’t be reopened until some
kind of study or reassessment of the
positives and the negatives of the bus lane
were concluded.”

St. John said “That study is in progress
and being coordinated by the Port
Authority. It is unclear how long it will
take, but we think within the next month
to two months it might be completed and
that may pave the way for reopening the
lane.” 1

“We heard 60 to 90 days to do the study,
but we’re,not sure at this time.” said PAT

the time it takes on Forbes versus the time
it takes to get from point A to point B on
the Fifth Avenue bus lane.”

Other factors that will be considered
will be pollution, safety, wear and tear on
the roads, and the congestion of both
traffic and pedestrians. This will determine
if the bus lane is reopened or eliminated.

Many people would like to see the lane
completely removed. One strong advocate
for removal is University of Pittsburgh
President Wesley W. Posvar.

“T 0 place [a bus lane] against the traffic
ﬂow doesn’t make sense,” Posvar said.
“I’ve been opposed to it from the very
beginning. The arguments that I have
heard [in favor of the bus lane] are in

13.”

Sandra Phillips vice president of O.D.I.
states that having the bus lane on Fifth
Avenue will lower the pollution level.
“Forbes Avenue is a very crowded street,”
she said, “and when traffic is slowed down

the amount of pollution is increased. It’s ‘

that type of slow moving, thick traffic that
creates the most pollution.

“Plus, Forbes Avenue is more narrow
than Fifth Avenue and the buildings are
higher [on Forbes Avenue] and it holds in
the pollution. It makes the pollution for
the people in cars, on sidewalks, and in
stores much moredense. Faster moving
traffi on Fifth Avenue doesn’t create the

Theiword is “ming zhu.”
Approximately 3,SO0Amen'cans
traveled to
Washington D.C. ,Sunday to
celebrate this word. In Chinese,
“rning zhu” is written with the
‘character for “people” and the
character for “master.” The word
is “people master.” The idea is

democracy.

""Ihe reason we are gathered
here is because each one of us
has a dream,” said Shen Tong, a

,3 pro—democracy movement leader

who was forced to leave China
after June's T iananmen Square
massacre. .
“A dream of a better China,”
said Tong from the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial. “A freer China.
A more democratic China. In
cprder to create from our dreams

rally for Chinese political reform

a crystal reality, each and every
one of us must begin within
ourselves.

“Freedom is rooted in your
hearts. It does not come from me.
It does not come from any student
leader. It is from within yourselves
and can and will change the
nation.”

Approximately 100 students
from the University of Pittsburgh
participated in the demonstration.
Most of the'Pitt participants were
members of the university's
Chinese Students and Scholars
FriendshipAssociation, a member
of the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars,
which organized the protest.

“We went there to demonstrate
against the [Chinese] government
because they are not the people’s
government anymore,” said Wang
Shen, president of the Pitt group.
“We want our voice to be heard

by the government. We are

against them."
According to Shen, all Chinese

citizens in the United States were

warned by a front page editorial

in the Sept. 19 People's Daily not

to participate in Sunday’s

demonstration.
“It’s very clear from the editorial
that if you go [to the

demonstration] you will be

I marked as a counterrevolutionary.

Many people were upset," said
Sheri.

Once so marked, a returning
Chinese student could be arrested
and his or her family pressured
into denouncing their child or
being forced to go into exile, he
said.

Many at the protest refused to
let their names be printed for fear
of future Chinese government
action against them or their
families.

“I don’t think it would be a
good idea ifl gave you my first
name," said a Mr. Wang from
Carnegie Mellon University. “We
have families back home, and we
don’t want them to worry about
what we’re doing,” he said.

Others, like Xue Ming Yang of
the University of Santa Barbara,
were not hesitant about talking
about their involvement.

“(The protest] is great except
for the weather,” said Yang,
referring to the downpour that
lasted through the entire event.
“This is the way we speak out.”

“We [the Santa Barbara group]
got here Friday and went down
to the Chinese embassy. A man
with a video camera came out [of
the embassy] and began taking
pictures of the crowd. We all
shouted ‘Shame! Shame!’ and he
went in after about 30 minutes,”

Grant gives
opportunity

By Shelena Rauscher
For The Pitt News

Pitt is offering a program which
students to

no charge, being one of only six
universities inthe United States
to do so.

The program allows the
students to obtain a master's
degree in orientation and mobility
instruction and a degree in
education. A three— year grant of
$80,000 thatgenables the university
to pay for the “program was
submitted to the United States
Department of Education by Dr.
George Zimmerman, assistant
professor for the visually impaired
at Pitt.

The grant was received by the
federal government in August of
this year. It is used to pay the
tuition of students who meet the
speciﬁc requirements and are

interested in working with the

visually impaired.

The program, headed by ‘

Zimmerman, lasts a period of 12
months and involves many hours
of clinical work.

Amy Neil, a student involved in
the program, applied to graduate
school and upon acceptance was
awarded the scholarship. She is

now completing her clinical work _

at the Western Pennsylvania
School for the Blind. Following
her seven weeks there, she will
work "at the Pittsburgh Blind
Association for seven additional
weeks.

She considers the program

Pitt was chosen because the
grant was well—written, and Pitt
offers a dual certification while
other universities only offer a
single major, according to Dr.
Zimmerman.

The field in which the dual '

certifcication is given is relatively
new, according to Larry Bieberly,

involves helping visually impaired

Stress causes college problems

By Diane Wolf
For The Pitt News

Nobody has to tell Rene Lukas,
a sophomore nursing student at
Pitt, that stress can be hazardous
to your health. She learned that
lesson the hard way during the
third week of her freshman year.

“I wentto class one morning at
11,” Lukas said, “and by 11:30, I
was back in my room — deathly
sick. I had a fever of 104 and
couldn’t move my neck.” _

A doctor at Pitt’s Student Health
Clinic examined Lukas and sent
her to Presbyterian Hospital for
further tests. After performing a

painful spinal tap, which ruled

out the possibility of spinal
meningitis, the hospital staff told
Lukas there was nothing they
could do for her.

“They didn’t even givegme an
aspirin,” Lukas said. “They said it
was all caused by stress.” '

Lukas went home to rest, and
her fever and other symptoms
disappeared overnight.

“I really was sick,” she added.
“But now I know that stress can
do that to you.”

Although Lukas’ severe reaction

may have been unusual, stress‘

affects everyone to some degree,
according to Tawnya Farris,
coordinator of the stress
management program sponsored
by the Health Education Office of
Student Health Services.

“How a stress affects you
depends on your personality and
how you cope with things,” Farris
said. “There’s a range of things
that can happen, and if you ignore
symptoms, they can definitely
worsen.” 1

According to Farris, a student ,

at Pitt's Graduate School of Public
Health, large amounts of stress
can trigger a variety of problems
from physical difficulties such as
headaches and digestive
disorders, to psychological
symptoms ‘such as increased

irritability, depression and"

withdrawal. .
The causes of stress in college

students seem to be as varied as
the effects are. Many of them are
' obvious — grades, homesickness,
pressure from parents and friends
— but there may be stress
producers built into the
environment at Pitt that students
aren’t aware of.
“I think the size of the campus
can contribute to the stress,” Farris
said. “It can seem like you’re lost

in an infinite number of people.” -

Pitt’s urban setting can add to
the confusion. “It’s a busy place
with an intermingling of people
who are working and people
going to school, so the campus is
sort of undefined,” Farris said.

So what can one do to avoid all
these stressful situations? Nothing.
But with the help of stress
management programs, like the
one offered by the Health
Education Office every term,
students can learn to cope with
the problems of collegelife.

“The first thing we do is to help

— the students deﬁne stress in

I general and in their own lives,”
Farris said. She said the first of

~ four sessions in the program is

devoted to showing students
how stress affects each of them as
individuals.

During the second and third
sessions, various techniques are
introduced that students can use
to cope with stressful situations.
These sessions focus on topics
such as progressive muscle
relaxation, positive vs. . negative
outlooks, personality types and
time management skills.

The roles of nutrition and
exercise in controlling stress are
the subjects of the final session.
Farris said that a well-balanced
diet with the proper amount of

“high energy foods” such as
carbohydrates is “extremely
important” to successful stress
management.

But Farris emphasized that just
learning the techniques is not
enough.

“The key is practice,” she said.
“I would hope that students would
have some level of success from
week to week, but it’s a
continuous process.

Farris also offered a ﬁnal piece
of advice to all of the stressed-out
students at Pitt.

of time and money has been
invested to reopen the bus lane.
Phillips said, “I don’t think [the
investrnentl is a major reason to
keep the bus lane, but there is a
question on how you should
spend public money, and you
have to be careful and not waste
it.”

_However, Posvar disagreed.
“Having wasted an investment is
not a rationalization for [the bus
_lane’s] use.”

Posvar said he does not have
much faith in the study. “I
somewhat doubtful [that] this
study will be completely

_ objective. [The lane is] illogical,

it’s less safe, it’s bound to be
more costly, and it’s bound to be
less efﬁcient.

“I will continue to express my
view. I think that there has been

a very positive response to my
argument. Commissioner Flaherty
agrees with it, he is opposed to
the bus lane. The Paramedical
Union strongly supported this
argument; the doctors and health
centers strongly oppose the lane. ”

Phillips said that she did have
hopes for the study. “I do think
that everyone wants to come up
with objective answers, ” she said.
“Peter Flaherty from the county
asked for the study, and he
opposes the bus lane. So I don’t
see why just because the county
pays for [the study], it won’t be
objective. Also, if the study shows
that it would be better to have the
bus lane on Forbes Avenue, then
I think people will consider it.

Fifth Avenue will be the safest

Posvar denied having any

inﬂuence on the study, or being

spoke of. “lThe University] is not
a major funder of PAT but we
certainly provide a large number
of customers," he said.

“One flimsy argument that I’ve

Forbes Avenue might lose
business,” Posvar added. “It seems
to me that if you put [all] of the
bus passengers going through
Oakland on Forbes Avenue, it
would improve business.

“The head of the dental clinic

taking away the bus lane would

Many Chinese students stayed
away, according to Mark Sun, a
Pitt graduate student active in the

ipro-democracy movement.

Despite these signs of worry, Sun
said that the atmosphere of the
protest was one of both “fear and
hope.” i

“I'm trying to catch a spy!” said
Yueqian Zhen of the State
University of New York at Buffalo.

. Zhen said that he was looking for

a man who at a previous
Washington demonstration had

— identiﬁed himself as a journalist

with the South Asian News

Agency of China and taken down C

Zhen’s name and phone number.

According to Zhen, the man ‘

had shown up at Sunday’s rally
without press credentials and
“ﬂew away” when Zhen tried to
take his photograph.

“That was him in the white '

jacket!” said Zhen, pointing and

snapping a picture with his I

camera. Zhen then disappeared
into the crowd.

The demonstration ended with C

a march from the Lincoln
Memorial through the streets of
Washington to the Chinese
Embassy- With a sound car

playing taped shouts of “Long

live democracy, long live the

people, and long live humanity,” C

the protestors made their way

along 17th Street, which was

closed to motor traffic. ,

“I think this is great,” said Bryan
Wilkes, a student at the University
of Delaware who ran into the
march to shake hands with some
of the demonstrators.

“To the media [the democracy
movement] is a dead issue. There

was alot of coverage right after ..

the massacre, but there’s not so
much now. As soon as the blood
stops, the coverage stops. It’s not
iust a liberal or conservative issue.

thought having the buses rerouted
to Forbes “would have a negative
effect on the businesses.”

According to Dr. Edward L.
McCord, assistant to the president,

“By focusing on the bus lane as .

the major alternative, the city can
ignore other alternatives, such as
moving parking to Fifth Avenue
[bus lane] off of Forbes,
redeveloping the bus stops at
more optimal, less crowded
locations on Forbes, or even
finding ways of routing a lot of
buses in other ways so that you're
not sending so much bus traffic

on Forbes. Some of these buses
might be able to take other
routes.”

, Phillips said, “No one has
proposed moving parking. There
would be a. great danger in
moving parking into the bus lane,
because that lane is so narrow,
and traffic is so fast moving. I
don’t think the city will even
allow it.

“If there are buses that don’t
need to go through Oakland,
then we will support [rerouting
them]. However, Forbes Avenue
and Fifth Avenue are main arterials
from the East to Downtown.”

C/omoz celebration oz 5/yam

The Fourth of July is a day of celebration all over

America. People celebrate it in many different ways, ‘ 1
4 usually by lighting fireworks, having picnics and

maybe even tipping a few bottles. But no matterhow
it is celebrated, it is always by choice, no one is
forced to honor the fourth day of July. 2

In‘China, it is a different story.

China recently celebrated the 40th anniversary of
the founding of the Peoples Republic of China. This
name is a bit ‘ironic considering that there is nothing
about the ,_ Republic of China that belongs to the
people. 0 . " . B ‘ A

Many citizens were literally forced to enjoy the
“celebration” which, incidentally,.was held in Tian-

‘anmen Square. What a coincidence. A statue of a

worker, a peasant and a soldier was placed in exactly

the same spot where the students had erected a

‘_‘Goddess of Democracy” during the revolt in early
June. Obviously, another coincidence.

Approxirnately 120,000 dancers were selected to
perform‘ for the crowd — many of them against their
will,»according to a press report .from Beijing. Mas-
sive fireworks displays were also part of the cheerful -
celebration, which was _ only for those who had V
invitations. . 2 V

The happy occasion required thousands of military
and police reinforcements to block off Tiananmen
Square before a 28-gun salute opened the festivities
-— literally with a bang. -

Once again, things like this remind us that no —

matter how corrupt the American government may
be or may not be, there are always even more corrupt
governments. Our sympathy goes out -to all those
who have loved ones under the oppressive rule of i

any gOV€I'I1fI1€f1[.

When the Chinese government murdered pro-
democracy demonstrators, the world was appropri- ,
ately shocked. Now the Chinese government has the
nerve to hold a‘ celebration for communist rule in the
same place thatso many students gave up their lives
for democracy. Appalling indeed.

7706 old Pittspirit returning

In late August of 1985, the Pitt
football team opened its season
against Purdue and a highly touted

‘quarterback by the name of'Jim
Everett. It was Pitt’s first night

game ever. Students liked the
idea of a night game. They could
catch the contest and, whether
the Panthers won or lost, could
hit the bars or frats without miss-
ing a beat (this was in the days of

wet rush). Day games and the .

early tailgates that went with them
left the revelers tired by the time
the game ended and out of the
spirit that a win byuthe football
team could bring. 2

Unfortunately, fans didn’t have
much to get excited about that

yearvor the season before. The

Panthers dropped to a dismal 3-

7-1 in.1984, followed by a 5-5-1 ,

record in 1985. ,

Those records were nothing to
cheer about as the Panthers soon
found out. Average attendance
slipped to 39,237 in 1984 and
rose slightly to 40,220 in 1985.
The Panthers averaged over
50,000 the previous four years.

Until that Purdue game. The
Stadium was packed and the game
was televised by ESPN. The
Panthers and the Boilermakers
seemed intent on making the
game a tie. Purdue led 10-7 after
the first quarter. The Panthers
scored14 unanswered points in
the second period, taking a 21-10
halftime lead. Purdue rallied with
14 points of its own in the third
quarter, setting up a climactic
fourth quarter.

Tailback Charles Gladman
found the end zone from 10 yards
out, and Mark Brasco added a
field goal that gave the Panthers

hing from us?

lerns associated with having an
unplanned baby, but pretending
the baby isn’t human and killing
it does not solve them. The solu-
tion, rather, lies in reaching out
with love, compassion, and fi-
nancial support towards these
women and their children.

a 31-24 edge.

V Everett hit Purdue receiver Ray
Wallace with a 31-yard touch-
down pass with only seconds
remaining. Down by one, the
Boilermakers decided to go for
the win rather than the tie and
attempted a two-point conver-
sion.

The Panther defense wouldn’t
allow it, and Everett's pass fell
incomplete. The Panthers eased
out of Pitt Stadium with a 31-30
victory.

The capacity crowd roared its

 

approval. Not many fans, if any,
had left during the game. They
oohed and aahed with each score,
each tackle, admonishing the

Purdue players while supporting .

their own team; rather, its own
team. The fans ceased becoming
fans sometime during the game
and became a crowd, a single
entity. It shook the stadium with
each score, groaned with each
mistake. It waved. to the ESPN
‘cameras.

_ "Aside from one or two games
since then —— most notably a 10-
Ovictory over Penn State in 1987
and a 48-16 walloping of West

Virginia in 1986 — spirit hasn't-

been the same. Easier to stay at
the tailgate when a Panther loss is
anticipated. Simpler to stay in-
doors and watch the game on TV,
or maybe take in another game if
Pitt isn’t on.

That all changed on the eve-
ning of Saturday, Sept. 23. Pitt’s
30-23 victory over Syracuse sent
the Panthers into the Top 10 for
the first time since 1983. For the
first time in almost‘ as many years,
the Panthers can claim the fan

support that befits them.

Pitt Stadium was alive that night.
It wasn’t artificial. It wasn’t due to
the gold -shakers handed out

before the game. It wasn’t be-

cause the game was televised by
ESPN. Students have decided to

stake their claim in this year’s Pitt
football team, and the Panthers

are responding. 2

Even in the season opener

against Pacific, students were

involved. They sang with the

band. They didn’t let the cries of
the cheerleaders die without‘
voicing them themselves. They

T got involved. Maybe it’s the fresh— V

man-class. That would be funny
since they’re the most impres-
sionable. Seems they would take

notice of the upperclassmen sit-

ting 'stoica1ly (perhaps silently
drunk) all around them.

Then again, tailgatesi don’t exist
as they once did._ The -Syria
Mosque parking lot is no longer
open to partying.

The number of tailgaters has
decreased although some

diehards still lug their kegs to any

available parking lot.

It seems as if all the classes are
going through a! resurgence.
Everyone is represented, by them-
selves and the person sitting next
to them. They has become an it
again. It moaned as the West
Virginia and Penn State scores
ﬂashed across the scoreboard. It
responded to theantics of Pren-
tiss Wright, twirling his towel as
he danced around the field. It
mimicked Marc Spindler and Tony
Siragusa, arms raised after a sack
or hurry. It applauded and
stormed the field as the Panthers
raised their helmets in victory.

Will it be back? The Panthers
don’t play at home again until
Homecoming against Navy on
Oct. 14. Was this simply a ﬂash in
the pan, a show for the television
cameramen and a national view-
ing audience? It didn’t seem like
it. It seemed genuine.

Tradition has failed the foot-
ball team for a few years, as have
the fans. Perhaps it’s time to build
a new tradition, one that may
have begun on Sept. 23, 1989.

Pittsburgh tend to prematurely
judge engineering majors as
geeks. However, anyone who
has taken the time to partake in a
discussion with one of our fine
engineering troopers knows this
is far from the truth. A few days
ago I had a simply brilliant con-
versation with my buddy Eugene
Schnurt on the pros and cons of
X-ray diffraction processes. Being

the specialist, he more or less’

embarrassed me. .As if that were-
n’t enough, that evening I had the
misfortune of going to _a party
with Eugene. As the night pro-
gressed, a number of us began
playing drinking games. We were
playing quarters for some time
before Eugene decided to join in

(he had been ‘sitting, observing

the party, in a corner with his
Hewlett-Packard calculator for
about half an hour). He immedi-
ately sat down and divided the

. table into quadrants with his

pencil, and proceeded to make
his first 153 attempts. Needless to
say, it was Eugene,,not the rest of
us, who was keeping track; I

easily see the disappointment
radiating from their faces. The
grand ﬁnale is destroyed. I think
to myself, “I should have said

behavioral neuropharmacology.

This may sound like an exag-
geration, but,it’s not. This kind of
scenario has occurred more times
in the past two years of my col-
lege career than I can count on
my fingers and toes. It’s not so
bad when it’s a bunch of drunken
college guys, but it’s really un-
cool when it’s a professor, par-

WEDNESDAY,OCTOBER 4,1989 

Gottfried in favor of help for injured Steve Israel

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

Pitt sophomore defensive back/
kick returner Steve Israel
underwent surgery for torn
ligaments in his right knee
yesterday.

Israel sustained the injury in
Saturday’s game against West

‘ Virginia returning a kick-off. His
leg got caught in the turf causing
enough damage in his knee to
put him out.of action for‘ the
remainder of the season. .

Although it was early
speculation, Israel’s football
career was in jeopardy at the time
of the injury.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried, I

L, currently working on his team's
chances at a national
championship, is also concerned
about his players’ chances to
someday make the pros. Gottfried
believes Israel has this kind of
talent. ‘

j “I would consider him a player
who has ‘ potential.,” said
Gottfried. “He’s got to prove a lot,
but at least he’s young. He’s go
a chance to be there.” —

Gottfried thinks enough of

Israel’s ability that he raised an »

issue about the possibility of an
NCAA rule change that would
insure college athletes a possible

future from a career threatening‘

injury.,

“Here’s a kid with a knee injury
and is out for the year. His parents
have to pay their way in (to
Pittsburgh) and miss two or three
days of ,work. There should be

V some compensation (for ‘the
family)."

The extent of the injury is more
than financial, Israel’s status as
an athlete and a student will be
affected. ,

"‘He’s going to get set back
academically and athletically. I
think there is something that we
ought to be able to do, as an
institution, to provide
(compensation) for somebody
who is hurt playing the game of

football, who could have a career
ending injury, in a game
representing the university.”
Gottfried used Penn State’s star
running back, Blair Thomas, as
an example. He said it would be
a shame if someone with abilities
like Thomas would; lose the
opportunity to
professionally.
Thomas missed all of the 1988
season because of torn ligaments
in his right knee, the same injury
as Israel’s. Thomas sustained his

" injury in December 1987 working

out for the ’88 Citrus Bowl.
“It seems to me there are some
things (the school) should be

able to do to help a player,

because he is playing in a game
representing the university.”
Gottfried said he does not know
what the answer is for. such a
situation, but it is something that
should be explored by the NCAA.

Gottfried suggested an example 8

for a rule that would allow
compensation, to athletes with
potential tobe insured from career
threatening injuries.
He said the university should
be allowed to pay insurance for a
select number of players “who
couldn’t afford to pay it” and for
players “who have the ability to
play in the pros.”
“I just think they ought to pay

the parents’ way in and be able to A

keep them here while he’s in the
hospital and, somehow, be able
to help Steve Israel. He’s going to
miss classes for a while and be on
crutches.” ,
“I am always concerned about
a player, like Israel, to lose a
chance at the pros.”
Israel returned 11 kicks for 235
yards and a 21 .8 yard average this
year for Pitt. His long_ return was
. 47 yards against the University of
Pacific. He also returned the
opening kick off of the year
against Paciﬁc for a touchdown,
but it was called back due to a
Panther penalty. Israel also had
five total’ tackles for Pitt, four
unassisted. ‘

Freshmen lead women ’s tennis

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

For the first time in seven years,

Pitt’s tennis program has the
Capability to offer athletic
scholarships and the Panther
women’s program has beneﬁtted
heavily with the addition of two
of the better scholastic players on
the East Coast.

Current freshmen Erika
Devins and Julie LoPrinzi both
were heavily recruited from their
respective high ‘schools and
decided to come to Pitt to play for
George Dieffenbach. Both
freshmen have made .such an

V impact that they comprise the top

two singles positions and the No.
1 doubles combination.

So far, both have struggled in
their brief period of playing, as
only LoPrinzi managed to win a
match at the recent Women's
Intercollegiate Tournament held

, in Trenton, NJ.

However, both of them were

on top of their games in an
impressive doubles performance,
winning the consolation ﬁnal.
“It's gone about like I would
have expected it to,” LoPrinzi,
who currently occupies the No. 2

’ position, said. “I expected to lose

a few and win a few.

“I definitely expected some
losses playingat No. 2. I need to
get some matches under my belt
because most of the girls I'm

“playing [against] have a lot more

experience and are juniors or
seniors."

Devins jumped right into the
feature—match position and
echoes similar sentiments as
LoPrinzi.

“There's a lot of competition,”
she says. “We’re getting to play a
lot of good girls and getting the
experience.”

LoPrinzi was the top female
singles player in the 16-and-under
age group in New Jersey while
Devinsgwas a star at her high
school in Pottstown, Pa. They

both knew each other through
the sport in high school, but did
not foster a close friendship.

All of that changed once their
college, careers began, now
roommates and the closest of
friends.

“We were just acquaintances

‘in high school ,” LoPrinzi said.

“Now since we're roommates,
we’ve become real good friends.

“Erika’s more of the shy type
and I’m real outgoing. It sort of
balances out — I’ve gotten her
out of her shell and she’s calmed
me down a lot.”

Although they have different 6

personalities, both Devins and
LoPrinzi share one strikingly
similar characteristic: they want
the Pitt tennis team to gain more
respect in the East region.

Both feel 8 that the
scholarships, although only
partial, are definitely something?

Pens and Canadiens to dominate Wales Conference

The Wales Conference will
feature an interesting battle for
first place in both divisions.

The Adams has overtaken the
Patrick in skill level. The Patrick
has seen only the Penguins and
Devils improve with the Flyers,
Capitals and Rangers declining.
The Islanders are simply awful.
In the Adams, Buffalo and
Hartford look to improve with
Montreal and Boston remaining
about the same. Quebec stays in

the basement with the Islanders. ,

Adams Division I

The Canadiens will continue to
rule in a division which is stacked
with defense. Boston may falter
to a much more talented Buffalo
team. Hartford and Quebec will
again battle for the ﬁnal playoff
spot. ,

The Montreal Canadiens
have everything except the Cup.
They got weaker with the loss of

A left winger Bob Gainey (now
coaching in France) and
defensemen Larry. Robinson (to
Los A Angeles) and Rick Green
(retired). But it is believed that
players such as Claude Lemieux
and Stephan Richer did not play
up to potential last year. The

Canadiens have players who can ‘

score, though no high- scorer,
and one of the best defenses in
the league. If the defense falters,
they have the league’s best goalie
in Patrick Roy (who is only 24)
and an equally capable back—up
in Brian Hayward. It will‘ take
harder work for this team towin

. it all, but they do not have the

pressure of defending the title. A
24th championship ’ is very
possible for Les Habitants-

The Buffalo Sabres will ﬁnally
get over the hump and beat out
Boston for second. The Sabres
have a good mix of young players
with seasoned veterans. Players
like Pierre Turgeon,‘ Uwe Krupp,
Doug Bodger’ and Phil Housley
will continue to improve. The
addition of Soviet Alexander
Mogilny will give the Sabres some
more scoring punch. (Mogilny
was one of the , top young
superstars in the Soviet Union).
Veterans including Grant Ledyard,

Christian Ruuttu, Dave
Andreychuk and Rick Vaive will
provide leadership. The
acquisition of goalie Clint
Malarchuk completed a solid
defensive corps. Malarchuk will
play most of the time, something
he did not have a chance to do in
Washington with Pete Peters.
Daren Puppa will provide a
young, but capable back-up.

Buffalo has the‘ ability to score

 

and defend in a tough division.
The Boston Bruins have a
solid defensive team. They just
lack the ability to put the puck in
the net. Cam Neely.1ed the team
with only 37 goals last year. This
would not be bad on a team like
Montreal who had eight players
with 20 or more goals. The
problem in Boston is that they
only had two other players who
broke the 20—goal plateau (Randy
Burridge, 31, and Ken Linseman,
27). Bobby‘ Carpenter was
acquired to help score some goals.
He once scored 53 goals for

Washington. But he only had 16‘

last year. This is one of the best
defensive teams in the league.
Ray Bourque will once again lead
the blue—liners in front of goalies
Reggie Lemelin and Andy Moog;

Positive Proof of Age Required

Bourque must remain healthy to
keep the young defensemen in
order. -

The Hartford Whalers have P

similar problems to Boston, lack
of scoring but good defense.
Kevin Dineen dominated the goal

» scoring. He led the team with 45

goals, 16 better than second best
scorer Ron Francis. Hartford is
not as big and talented as Boston
at the blue line. David Babych,
Sylvain Cote, Norm Maciver and
Ulf Samuelsson are capable
defensemen, but this is not
enough in a division which
emphasizes defense. Netminders
Kay Whitmore and Peter
Sidorkiewicz will take over for
Mike Liut. They can certainly
handle the job, but they are no
Roy and Hayward. Rick Ley finally
gets his chance to be behindthe
bench in the big leagues. Ley will
get the most out of his young
players, just as he did ‘in the
minors. Another playoff spot is
probable in Hartford. So is another
sweep at the hands of Montreal.
Michel Bergeron takes over
behind the bench for the Quebec
N ordiques. He must build a team
full of young defensemen. The
defensemen must gain expelience
before they can challenge for a
playoff spot. Their biggest
acquisition was signing top Soviet
goaltender Sergei Mylnikov. They
needed a strong netrninder to
play behind their weak defense.
Quebec also added Joe Cirella to

the blue line. However, he had a
-14 plus-minus ratio. In fact,
Quebec's entire defense finished
on the minus side last year, except
for Randy Moller (+2). Scoring is
also a weakness. Peter Stastny
will lead an inept scoring attack.
The Nords are desperate for
scorers. They acquired Lucien
Deblois and Guy Laﬂeur to help
out on offense. This will hardly
be enough.

 

. Patrld<Division

The most offensively talented
team in the NHL is going to need
to a little improvement on defense
to capture their first Patrick‘
division title. The Pittsburgh
Penguins believe they have
improved their defense this
season with the off—season
acquisitions of Gilbert Delorme
and Jim Kyte. Both defensemen
are known for their ‘tough play
around the net. If the Pens can
play defense like they did in the
playoffs last season, look for Tom
Barrasso to battle’Patrick Roy of
the Canadiens for the Vezina (best
goalie) Trophy. Another
acquisition of Pens’ General
Manager Tony Esposito was right
winger Andrew McBain. Mario
Lemieux, Paul Coffey, Zarley

Zalapski, Rob Brown, Dan Quinn
and McBain could possibly be
the most dangerous power play
in league history. McBain will
also team with Lemieux on
penalty killing. Don’tbe surprised
to see Lemieux break his own
NHL record of 13 shorthanded
goals. Overall, if the team can
stay away from
overabundance of penalties (they
set a NHL record in team penalty
minutes last year), look for the
Penguins to ﬁnish at the top of
the Patrick. I
The most improved team in the
NHL this season will be the New
Jersey Devils- They added two
Soviet players, Viacheslav Fetisov
and Sergei Starikov. When Fetisov
was in his prime, he’ was

considered the best defenseman.

wanted these two players to add

AROUND ONCE

How _ would you spend tomorrow if you
knew it was your last day? What do you think life
is all about? You might do something to become
famous so you could endure in history. Frighten-
ingly, Sirhan Sirhan thought this way. After shoot-
ing Robert Kennedy he said: "They can gas me but
I am famous. I have achieved in one day what it
took Robert Kennedy all his life to do.”

If tomorrow was your last day you might do
good for others. But what assurance do you have
that your efforts will be for good? For example,
feeding the poor may save lives or prolong misery.
Neither hope for fame nor hope for doing good are
sure hopes. '

Perhaps lack of sure hope in such things is
why you might spend your last day partying. You
might feel the only sure way you can make your
life worthwhile is to live it for yourself.‘ Yet_isn't

But if God exists and Jesus rose from the dead
then reality is different. You are unique. Your re-

to you and you can reach back. You do only go
around once, so what is life all about?

The Duchesses’ managed to
score two points before hitting
the ball into the net, handing Pitt
the first game.

Woodstra brought out two
substitutes to start the second
game, but the Dukes play only
seemed to deteriorate. Pitt’s first
four points were the result of
Duquesne miscues, and Heather
Hollands, Bridget Gary, Lantagne
and Linda Zols helped the Lady

The third game started much
the same as the first two, with Pitt

“They fight pretty hard, they

Peter Sundstrom come through,
look for the Devils to have home
ice advantage in the playoffs.

The presence of the
Philadelphia Flyers as always
will be felt in the Patrick Division.

., Ask Chris Chelios of Montreal

about feeling the presence of the
Flyers. A lot will be known about
the Flyers in the early part of the
season when they are without
their goalie Ron Hextall for the
first 12 games. Their goalie will
be Ken Wregget, and the pressure
is now his alone. In the last two
weeks, the Flyers have traded
both Pete Peters and Mark
LaForest for considerations. Even
after trading both of those goalies,
there are still rumors abound that
say Hextall and his contract
problems could be next. The
Flyers are looking for a goal scorer
to go with their often-injured
right wing Tim Kerr. They thought
Mike Bullard could fit the role
last season. Now the Flyers, along
with half the NHL, are looking
into acquiring the Jets’ Dale
Hawerchuk. Hextall for

  A Hawerchuk, Lord knows the Jets

need goaltending (even with the
addition of Peters). Hextall and
Hawerchuk will stay put, and the
Flyers will explore other routes
for their goal scorer. Hextall, Kerr
and the young defensive corps
should keep the top of the Patrick
division crowded.

The Washington Capitals
have a good offense and a sound
defense, but they really don't
have any type. of goaltending.
They look a lot like the Red
Wings. Both have a good mix of
talent but no goalie to lead the
way through the playoffs. Don
Beaupre and Bob Mason are the
Caps’ goalies. Neither have ever
been winners. Dino Ciccarelli was
a great addition down the stretch,
scoring 12 goals in the last month
to capture the Patrick crown. Rod
Langway and Scott Stevens are as
good a defensive tandem as any
team in the NHL. Mike Ridley and
Geoff Courtnall are the Caps’
scorers, and there is no reason to
believe their production will fall
off this season. The Caps are
missing a goalie and a team leader.
They acquired Dale Hunter two’
seasons ago, and he has never
developed into. the leader they
had hoped. If they don’t fill these
voids, the Caps will fall to fourth

place.

The New York Rangers have
been in a rebuilding year since
the 1940s. They ﬁred GM Phil
Esposito for firing the coach,
Michel Bergeron, before the
playoffs last season. They are a
team in search of an identity and
really have very little to work
with in terms of making any
quick climb back into the elite of
the Patrick division. The team is
led by Bob Froese and John
Vanbiesbrouck, (the goalies).
They are the most talented tandem
in the NHL, but much of their
work will go for nothing this
season. The new GM, Neil Smith,
has a foundation to build from as
long as he doesn’t do what
Esposito did. That is trade the
foundation. Brian Leetcht and
Tony Granato finished first and
second in the Calder (rookie)
Trophy voting last season and

are going to be looked upon to

carry this team. Leetch will be a
Norris Trophy (best defenseman)
contender for the next 10 years.
If the goaltending can stand the
shelling, and the team comes
together, the Rangers have an
outside chance at the playoffs.

for them to stay there. This team
has very little NHL experience.
Their goalies played in a
combined 24 NHL games last
year. The number- one goalie
will be Mark Fitzpatrick with his
back-up being Jeff Hackett. The
center position is the only place
on the team with experience and
proven talent. Pat LaFontaine,
Duane Sutter, and Brian T rottier
are the centers and the team
leaders. The Islanders’ front office
has called upon former Coach A]
Arbour to lead this team back to
where it was when he retired.

The Islanders are looking at this
year as a time for the team to
move back to respectability. With
Arbour as the coach, the Islanders
will more than likely only need
this year to get back. Are you
listening at Madison Square
Garden? One year.

The Wales Conference final
may see a classic goaltending
match-up between the toptwo

An early look at the upcoming
week of college football.
Boy, this prediction ‘stuff is
starting to get boring.
It isn't the predicting, however,
that is boring. In fact, I get a great
‘amount of pleasure from
outpicking everyone from Jimmy
the Greek to Mr. Monday Nite.
The part that I find tedious is
sending in those Pittsburgh Press
football contests every-week.

Sure, I collect $1,000 for my
trouble,’ but I have to come up
with a fake name every week in
order to be eligible. Well enough
babbling. Here are my picks:

Pitt 48, Temple 3

New Temple coach Jerry
Berndt is appropiately named
because his Owls got “Berndt”
for seven long touchdown passes
last weekend against Houston.
Expect much of the same this
week as the Panthers get one
game closer to “a battle of the
undefeated” when they meet
Notre Dame on October 28th.

A University of Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference event

Continued from page 10
made up of college coaches, have

contradicting views of the two
teams.

The AP moved Pitt up two
places to no. eight, and West
Virginia remained at no. nine.
The UPI poll has West Virginia
moved up one notch from last
week to no. eight. However, they
took Pitt out of their top 10, and
put them at no.12, despite Pitt

playing on the road and making

the incredible comeback.

“I can tell you right now, those
newspaper men know what
they’re doing,” quipped Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried at press
luncheon held yesterday. “I’m
really not concerned with it, "

When Pitt beat Syracuse they
cracked into the top 10 for the
first time since the 1983 season.

That is impressive considering
Pitt didn’t even get a top 20
appearance in any preseason
polls this year. It’s hard to say just
how far they will climb, but
Gottfried said that Pi.tt’s schedule

_ will be the biggest factor in the

determination.

“We have a tough enough
schedule that it will take care of
itself. We just have to be
concerned with this week and
playing better, and those things
will fall into place.”

Pitt defensive tackle Tony
Siragusa says it the best.

“If we beat everybody from
here on in, we'll be number one.”

Tennis

Continued from page 8
players’ heads like a carrot in
front of a rabbit.

“Those scholarships mean a
lot,” LoPrinzi said. “A lot of tennis
players won't look at schools
unless they get some type of
financial aid. ‘

“I know that I received some
phone calls from coaches and
basically turned them down when
they could not offer me any
money at all.”

“There are other things you
have to look at besides money,”
stated Devins. “But when you
work hard, you feel that you
deserve to be rewarded in some
way.”

And so, the two found
themselves headed to Oakland
to continue their playing careers.
Although they may be taking
their lumps now, both feel that in
the future they will do nothing
but improve.

“I want to play my best and
win as many matches as possible,"
LoPrinzi said. “I just want to learn

from the matches that I do lose, V

so maybe one day I'll be the
junior or senior with the
experience winning“ a lot of
matches.”

And maybe one day the
names Devins and LoPrinzi will‘
be synonymous with the rise of
Pitt tennis in the East.
