From the Student Government
Board elections to the Fair Share
Tax and some students’ G-20
Summit court hearings, The Pitt
News has had a lot to cover over 5
the past month.

So we’ll admit~we’ve fallen a
little behind in publishing the
Pitt police blotter. 5

To make it up to you .— and
because really, we don’t want
to pay attention in class, either

' . — we decided to devote today’s

news section to the blotter.

Devolution Revolution

A segment on CBS’s “The Early
Show” revealed scientiﬁc research
on the prospect ofturning chickens
into dinosaurs. Terrned “reverse
evolution,” the process involves
an idea to take chicken embryos
and “turn off development,” which
some scientists think will cause the
birds to revert to their prehistoric
forms. We’re excited for the pros-
pect of Kentucky Fried Dinosaur,
though the gravy will still be the
best part.

California Raisin’

The Board of Regents for the
University of California met last
week and decided to raise tuition by
32 percent. We didn’t know Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl sat on the board.

Happy Birthdays

Today marks the 150th anniver-
sary of the release of Darwin’s “On
the Origin of Species,” redeﬁning
our understanding of nature’s deli-
cate balance. Today is also the 138th
anniversary of the incorporation
of the National Riﬂe Association,
which remains committed to main-
taining that balance.

An article thatA. A. Campbell—Swinton
wrote in an issue of Nature in 1908

provides the impeurs for developing .

He ﬁrst proposed employing cath-
ode raytubes asbothtransmitters and
receivers in an attempt to devise f‘dis-
tant electric vision.”

A Morethanacenturylater, television
has trudged a mountainous climb. But
it hasn’t peaked yet.

So many options exist today.

Ittakes some knowledge before one '

can make an educated decision when
it comes to electronics. For instance,
which type: LCD, LED, DLP or Rear-

Projection?Whatparametersinrefresh .

rate, resolution, contrast ratio, Internet
capability, inputs and outputs? It’s no
ﬂeeting choice. .

then. Now wehave hardy, affordable
TVs on our shelves’.

Somethingnags atme, though.

Thelasttimelwasinanelectronics
store, I stopped infront of a240—hertz
LED TV. That's a high refresh rate, or
frequency of data being drawn.

When I_ viewed whatwas on, I real-
ized my eyes couldn’t differentiate the
picture from a120-hertz, slowerTV.

Ironically, this improvement had

~ no beneﬁt

The whole point of improved re-
fresh rate is to smooth the image and
reduce blur.Atacertain point, one can-
not detectblur—fewpeoplecandetect
blur above72 hertz. ‘ ,

Two-dimensional TVs might have
reached their fullest potential.

Sowhat’s,left on the horizon? With

present parameters exhausted, how

can TVs offer more options?

Simple. Add another dimension; ‘

3-D television.

Yes, 3-D TV. They are slated to be
available as soon as next year. Exact
pricing is not yet available, but we can

In the late ’90s and earlier this de-

cade, HDTVs struggled to stake their .

claim in the market.

People deemed HDTVs unneces-
sary. Regular TV was already good
enough. So a decade later, most of us
have these new models.

“  

We canexpectthethirddimension
to invade the American living room
soon. .

Even though the idea of 3-D has ex-
isted since the cardboard glasses ofthe
1950s, sales to individual consumers
could start another buying spree for
several reasons. _

Additionally, much oftoday’s enter-
tainment, suchas computer animation
and games, iscreated‘ﬁ'omscratch.Vid—

In fact, games are already created
in 3-D but normally haveto be down-
gradedto 2-D. ‘

With these new TVs, gamers can
become even more lost in their digital
worlds — a staggering feat in itself.

Broadcasting in 3-D has already

movie theater ticket sales for the 3-D
version of a release form the majority
of total sales.

For example, the 3-D version of "

“My Bloody Valentine” accounted for
71 percent of all sales.

As HDTVS have started becominga ’

Companies always need something

It is unclear how much consum-

I personally wouldn’t buy a 3-D TV

I’ve learned something ﬁom buy-

Besides, I justwantto give the engi-

Even so, consumers will be appre-

sets could decrease in price with time.
’ -But also, many will dislike the op-

mightﬁrstbring. .
‘ Can different viewers watch the
same television —, but one in 2-D and
the other in 3-D? Exactly which pro-

Theseareallquestions ofversatility,

Pitt defensive "end Greg Romeus was a top basketball recruit before stepping onto a football field ﬁve years ago

1

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

After exploding from a 3-point
stance, all it took was one fake‘ to
the inside. He had him.

Pitt defensive end Greg Romeus
extended his long arms into "Notre
Dame left tackle Paul Duncan’s

premier basketball recruit prior
to his senior year of high school.
That was before he moved to a
newly built Coral Glades High
School, which was starting a foot-
ball program.

“I was playing basketball, ‘

and the football coach needed
guys to come out to the team,”
Romeus said. “He just asked me

said.

Romeus leads a Pitt defense
that leads the nation with 41 sacks
through 10 games. Romeus has
7.5 of those sacks, matching his
season total from last year.

It’s a defensive line that will
play a key role in Pitt’s next
matchup againstwest Virginia
Friday. ‘

 

I was playing basketball, and the football coach needed
guys to come out to the team.

,,..chest, fought through Duncan’s

desperate block and dove for
quarterbackjimmy Clausen.

As Clausen went to throw the O

ball, Romeus chopped it from his
hands with Pitt leading Notre
Dame 27-22 with two minutes,
10 seconds left in the game.

The ball wobbled free and
was initially ruled an incomplete
pass. ' i

It wasn’t just a great play — it
was timely.

'1'" After referees ruled the incom-

pletion a fumble, Pitt took over
the ball and ran out the clock,
ending any comeback hopes for
the Irish.

Pitt won 27-22S", keeping its BCS

“bowl hopes alive. Romeus was a
“hero.

Along with the forced fumble,
Romeus batted down a pass, made
one tackle for a loss and blocked
an Irish extra point, the latter of
which forced Notre Dame to at-

*‘«tempt —- and fail — a two-point
conversion late in the game.

That’s impressive for some-
body in his ﬁfth year of playing or-
ganized football. It isn’t Romeus’
ﬁfth year at Pitt — it’s his ﬁfth

A (‘year actually playing football.

In 2005, in his hometown of
Coral Springs, Fla., Romeus faced
a decision his senior year.

In high school, Romeus was a

to come out, andl ended up com-
ing out.”

After playing six games, he
made his decision. '

“I didn’t even ’play basketball
my senior year,” Romeus said.

But he didn’t know he would
try playing Division I football un-
til December of that year. It was
then that Pitt coach Dave Wannst-
edt recruited Romeus without
much of a ﬁght.

Now, if coaches knew what

he’d become, other big pro-
grams in Florida might have
pursued Romeus to play football
for them. I

He has become-a starting de- .- —-
“ fensive end on one of the nation’s

best defenses.
“He goes up there every day
and does all the right things on

and off the ﬁeld,” Wannstedt said. A

“When you reﬂect back to when he
ﬁrst showed up here — a skinny,
6-foot-5, 220-pound basketball
player who played football for one
year —— and now you see him de-
veloping into one of the better
defensive ends inthe country.”

Wannstedt also said Romeus
could soon ﬁnd himself in the
NFL.

“I don’t know when, but we’ll
cross that bridgewhen we sit
down at the end of the year and
have a discussion together,” he

""*l$"Ul\‘?.i'\V‘

“Every guy on our defensive
line has .something different
about them they bring to the
game,” Romeus said. “Mick [Wil-

liams] is such a powerful guy. He’s
probably the strongest guy on our

team. Jabaal [Sheard] is a speed’

guy. Gus [Mustakus] has a com-
bination of both. They’ve taught
me a lot.”

With so much power on Pitt’s
defensive line, opponents have
taken notice.

“They play really good. They’re

Very stout and good players,”
West Virginia head coach Bill

Stewart said. “Their size, ex— ’

plosiveness —- they’re old guys
with two juniors and two seniors.
The inside guys are tough. I think
both ends are big, strong guys.”

But Romeus said he still needs
to learn more about playing de-
fensive end, and only more play-
ing time can help.

“I’m still learning so much
about the mental aspect and
being able to read offenses,” he
said. “Athletic ability can take

over certain things, but the men-
tal aspect is the thing I try to work
on the most.”

Fortunately, he’s had some

talented tackles during training
camps and practices over the
years to hone his skills.

“I would go against Jeff Otah
when he was here. It was deﬁnite-
ly a good experience,” Romeus
said. “He’s such a big, athletic
guy. He showed me how to use
my speed advantage on guys and
use power. When I see him now,
he’ll give me advice on things that
he sees, just things that can make
my game better.”

The advice has started work-
ing for Romeus, as evidenced by
the Notre Dame game. .

From the hardwood, to the
hard knocks «on other quar-
terbacks, Romeus has learned
through experience how to play
football.

- “God blessed me and gave
me the opportunity to come to
Pittsburgh,” Romeus said. “I came
here, and I remember the ﬁrst
drill I did.’I couldn’t even get in
a 3-point stance, but [the] coach
never got frustrated with me, and
he always helped me with stuff.”
