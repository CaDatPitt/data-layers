“It’s a little trick I learned in the
Yukon,” Jim (Sourdough) Glas-
gow, C43, said modestly when a
score of reporters interviewed him
today at the announcement of the
publication of his article, “How to
Deal Yourself a’ Perfect Poker
Hand”,in the Christmas issue of
the Panther on sale today.

After throwing a hunk of ﬁsh at
the three Alaskan huskie dogs in
the corner, Glasgow, who is Pan-
ther make-up editor on the side,
was persuaded to add a little more
to this vague remark, “Well, a
bunch of the boys were whooping
it up the other night. .4. .”

And so on far into the night
about a gal named Lou. This is
a newspaper so we can’t tell the
rest.

But the rest of the articles and

pictures in today’s issue of the
Panther make reading that is just
as interesting. For instance, the
regular “Hushed About” column,
the 13’ full-page pictures of Pitt
women.’ to represent the different
types at the University, the fiction
story, “Black Crow,” by Bill Beng-
hauser, and letters from Pitt,men
in the army.

Christmas» recess in all schools
and divisions will extend from
Monday, December 22, to Sunday,
January 4, inclusive. Classes will
be resumed on Monday, January 5.

the opinion that “youth will em-
erge stronger in respect to religion
because man will have come to
absolute dependence on God. Rel-
igion is stronger in " Russia today
though it is suppressed. .
‘The role of the church in prevent-
ing ‘-recurrent wars will take the
form of “teaching future genera-
tions to make, religion —the primary
and fundamental part of their in-
dividual lives by actually applying
it, Father Rock continued.

That is precisely. the fault of
both the adult and younger genera-
tions today. “Youth and old "age
fail to use religion as a rational
thing—--as an absolute necessity to
happiness.” V

Despite the fact that youth has _

at great many more diversions and
temptations, some of which are sin-
ful and some of which are not, they
have improved over their parents’
generation in that they have “a
freer, healthier attitude. They view
religion from a more logical stand-
point. Because our grandparents
and parents ﬁlled the churches is
no criterion of their religion.”

Father Rock pointed out that
ours is not the first generation
that has come through depression
and war. “History repeats itself,"
he said. “Each generation that goes
through” the battle against these.
forces “wins it.” Because of the
increase in education and experi-
ence “youth ftoday are better
equipped to light the present con-
dition” than their ancesters were.

~an‘irit'erviewl with 

Father Paul Rock

   

“Youth is not cynical, but prac-
tical. He wants ‘an answer to the
‘why.’ Since there is an answer to
every question we have 9. right to
give it to him.”_As to the alleged
conflict between religion and sci-

ence, the Catholic priest felt sure ,

“there is no conflict” but that re-
ligion and science “are dovetailed.
It is the atheistic scientist who has
a conﬂict. God is thegreatest sci-
entist of all scientists.”

“Why do young people need‘re-
ligion, and why more so .today"?”
was our next question. Because of

the increase of fémptations in the l

modern world there is an increase
in the “constant conflict between
good and evil and only by bring-
ing out the good“ in man can we

bring out the tendencies which will ’

overcome evil.”

“Though Catholics, Jews and
Protestants all believe in a su-
preme bejng whom we call God,
there are still important differences
between them. We should be tol-

erant to every man, but we can’t be _ -~

tolerant to principles that are
wrong,” he‘ thought. The way to
-bring about . greater tolerance is
“through education.” For instance
“The Catholic church must be
known for what she is, rather than
what she is rumored to-be.”

Terming it as “one of the most
beautiful things I ever saw,” the
' observance of traditional orthodox

Hebrew customs, which he saw in’ 

the home of a Jewish friend of his,

Father Rock was convinced that 
. , customs

of all religious sects
“should be continued, because in

_ -following them, man does what‘ 
A God wants and is with God in spir-
> , it.

Jones Discusses War in English Class
After Considering Situation for Week  

By ELAINE KAHN ,
Professors called upon to conduct

classes on the Monday, following
the Japanese attack, generally fol-
lowed one of three methods in re-
,gard to the war. ,
Some devoted the entire hour to
discussion of the war, others dis-
missed it with a brief comment,
and others made no reference to it
at all.

This latter course was employed
by Dr. Putnam F. Jones, associate
professor of English. That was on
Monday.

On Wednesday Dr. Jones ex-
plained himself. He told his classes
that he had thought a great, deal
about what he should say to them
on Monday and then had decided to
say nothing. He believed that it
was a time for thought rather than
for speech. He would," however, dis-
cuss theiwar on Friday.

.. ., And ,.911..F:rida.v Dr» Joliescdid-—

ers dealing with the German sci-

Scandinavian 2 countries ’ ’-‘might. be-
 attributed to this theory, _Ge,rmany_ _»
“thus t'1'ying to get the necessary

entific theory of geopolitics and
offered it as a possible explanation
for recent German actions. Geo-
politics is a science that sets forth
the idea that all human action is
inﬂuenced by the earth.
According to this theory the
three coiitimrnts“ of Europe, Asia,
and Africa are united into a single
unit kn:o*-.vn as the “world island,”
around which the other continents
are mere satellites. The key to the
whole world-island is__the “Heart-
land,” a district extending roughly
from the Volga to the Yangtze and
from the Himalayas to the Arctic‘
ocean. The disciples of this theory
believe that he who controls East
Europe rules the Heartland; who
rules the Heartland commands the
World-Island; and who controls the
World-Island rules the world.
. Dr. Jones stated that the German

sea power to secure complete domi-
nation of the Heartland.

     NEWMAN CLUB \ *  
TWELFTII’ ANNUAL WINTER. DANCE
“THE INTERCOLLEGIATF/’ 

Dr. Jones toldhis class that this‘ "

V was aiwar far different from the
last war. “At the conclusion of
the last war,” he declared, “there
were many, and for a time, I was
among them, who believed that we
had been duped into ﬁghting a war

\ for businessmen. But I think this
war is different and I think the
cause is well worth ﬁghting for.”

He characterized this as es-
sentially a conﬂict between two
codes of human ethics. The gen-
tleman’s code that believes that you
should wait until a man is facing
you before you hit him and the
gangster code that considers such
conduct weak and stupid.

Dr.,. J ones startled his class with
the statement, “You’re‘ Very lucky.
Some think that you are members
of an unfortunate generation, but
I.._ think you are lucky.. You are
lucky }-.because you‘ are young

I enough to go out and do something

about it and because what happens
will determine the course of human
civilization forthe next ﬁve hun-
dred to one thousand years.”‘

to balance the budget.

Mr. Rupp called attention to the_
fact that expenses for instruction
(largely salaries) were $98,000
more than last year. Funds devot-

ed to organized research and for ;

Doctor H. Clifford Carlsgifs latest basketball system, the
oscillatory offense, makes its debut tomorrow night at the
home of the Big Ten favorite, ‘Northwestern University.
‘Then, in rapid succession, the ice-cream eaters play Butler,

Indiana, and Cornell.

These four games will be played in ten days, which should
prove that the football team isn’t the only squad to draw a
suicide assignment. -

Should the good Doctor’: newest brainstorm turn out to
be as efficient as last year’s team, and should the jaunt through
the mid-west turn out to be as successful as. last _season’s trip,
the local fans are apt to see another championship squad this
winter.

It isn’t likely that the Panthermen will run into any more
serious competition than they will face over the Christmas
holidays. Of course, Penn State, Westminster, West Virginia,
and Army usually have pretty fair ball clubs, but nothing like
Northwestern, Butler, Indiana, and Cornell.

It would seem then that all the boys .will have to do is
play out the rest of the schedule, but that just isn’t done. Coach
Carlson will tell you that, because that is exactly what hap-

. pened last year.
The cagers came back from the mid-western tour sport-

ing four wins and two setbacks, and looking forward, with

hopeful gleams, to a national title. Westminster, Penn State,
and Waynesburg took the gleam out of their eyes when they
trounced the Pittmen soundly. That returned the boys to
normal. . ,‘
,_ Unlike last year's all-senior quintet, the locals have a
.well—balanced, well-coordinated group of seniors, juniors, and
sophomores.
‘ Flashes of brilliance by the underclassmen last season
' portend better things to come; they have potential greatness
combined with a bit of experience. It may be that this is the
year when “VVin ’em all” will become something more than a

slogan. Should the boys catch on to Carlson's oscillatory of- ‘

fense, whatever that may be, they should go places. ‘Even as
far as a national title. '

Fife, Gervelis Depart For Drills

Pitt Guard Ralph Fife'and End
Stan Gervelis who were recently
selected to play on the all-East
squad in the annual San Francisco
Shrine charity East-West game
had their hopes of spending New
Year’s day in sunny California
blasted by the Japanese attack on
the United States. Indeed, for a
time, it was doubtful as to whether
they would be able to play in the
classics at all.

However, the game has since
been shifted to New Orleans where
it will be played January 3. The
players will travel to Chicago

‘and Egan and Artman guarding.

The Panthers will leave Chicago
Sunday night and arrive in In-
dianapolis Monday morning where
they take on the Bulldogs of But-
ler that evening‘. Following the bat-
tle with Butler the local ice cream
heaters will entrain for home and
will get back early Tuesday.

With the new “oscillatory of-
Fense” having functioned more than
satisfactorily during the warm up
games against the cream of the
local semi-pro outﬁts, it is not un-
likely that -the Panthers will come
home with two wins under their
belts. Carlson, as per usual, has
been very optimistic over the out-
look for this season. His “win ’em
all” slogan has long been the pass-
word of the team prior to the open-
ing of a new season. This year the
‘team has caught some of his en:
thusiastic fever and has set the
Sugar Bowl game, to be played in
New Orleans in March, as its
goal. If this means anything, Otto
Graham and company are in for a
tough time tomorrow night.

Alarm Pitt

The surprise Japanese attack on
Hawaii came as a shock to all, but
its effects were especially felt by
one Pitt student who was instant-
ly concerned with fear for the
safety of _her family.

The student, Lorraine Williams,_
who has been in the States only
since September 16, lives in Ha-
waii, a scant ﬁve miles from now
,h'rstoric Pearl Harbor. A graduate
of the University of Hawaii where
“ she specialized in so"cial work, Miss
Willi-ams came to the Ilniversity of
Pittsburgh on a fellowship to earn
her MA degree in the same ﬁeld.

Miss Williams received a letter
from her parents on the Monday
“ following the invasion. The letter

had been written prior to the at.-

tack and in it her mother com-
mented on the fact that “sentries
are posted "along the beach.” The
letter voiced, the fearful hope that
“we do not have a war with Japan.”

It was not until Tuesday, how-
ever, that Miss Williams received
telegrams assuring her of the safe-
ty of her parents and friends.

In the ﬁrst mail to come from

the island since the outbreak of the
war she received a brief note from
a friend that bore the war symbol
“censored.” The only reference to
war was contained in the state-
ment, “I can’t tell you anything,
but,we are all well and are taking
this like true Hawaiians.”

Miss Williams expressed her own
great surprise at the Japanese at-
tack. Although all the mail she has
received from home has, from
time to time, commented on the

-tenseness of the situation, no one

ever actually expected a war with
Japan. » s "

j‘There is no racial problem

there,” she stated. “The majority

of the population is Japanese. I
went to school with many of them.
I have workedwith them and have

eaten with them. I never had the .

feeling that Japan would invade
us.”

Miss Williams was born on the
Island of Oahu,’ as were her par-
ents, Mr. and Mrs. James A. Wil-
liams. Her grandfather, James J.
Williams, first came to the island
from Maryland as a‘ photographer
and took many pictures of native
kings and queens in early days.
She has two brothers, aged 18 and
28, who she expects will be in' the
war shortly, and two sisters. ,

One of her sisters is in Chicago
studying court reporting. Imme-
diately after the - invasion, they
checked the possibility of return-
ing home, but passengers are not
being accepted for the western trip.

For the time being, at least, the
girls are forced to depend on the
newspapers and the censored mail
for their news of home.

board, and the National Travelers

- Aid associaton.

Italian Organizations
To‘ Remoin‘Unchanged -

Activities and aimsof the two
Italian social organizations on the
campus will not be altered in the
least by the fact that Italy and the
United States are now at war. This
is the opinion of John Christiano,
graduate student assistant in
mathematics. P

Mr. Christiano, adviser to the
Italian club and to APD, social fra-

ternity for Italian men students, 

was born in Italy as was Tony Pon-
tano, E42, Italian club president.
However, both emphatically declare
they are 100 per cent behind Ameri-
ca, and are very disappointed at
the actions of their fatherland.
