Women Present
Interclass Sing
Today At Noon

Drs. Armbruster, Elmer, Geise,
Williams, And Witz Named
As Judges Of Contest

By Alice Wright

When the Women’s classes meet at
12:30 o’clock today in Heinz House
for their interclass sing, the seniors
will offer particularly strong compe-
tition in their effort to keep the cup
which they won for two consecutive
years, and which will be their perma-
nent possession if they win again to-
day. It was their class that originated
the sing two years ago, when they
were sophomores. Betty Quarrie,

chairman, says, “Come on out, sen-
iors It’s going to be a hard pull to
get the cup again this year. Let’s
work!” Florence Price is the only
member of the senior committee. Vera
Kost is the class pianist.

Frances Dent, Ed35. general chair-
man, remarking on the preparation
for the sing, said, ‘‘If the interest
shown and the work done is any in-
dication of a successful sing, this
year’s interclass sing should be a
complete success. I certainly hope
so.” It was the junior class who is-
sued the challenge to the other
classes this year. The junior com-
mittee consists of: Frances Dent,
chairman, Anne McAfee, Muriel Dils,
Martha McCune, Elaine McLaughlin,
and Wynone Williams, pianist.

The sophomore class has had four
practices, and Kit Hall, chairman,
says, “I know that the sophomore
class will do their best to win. Come
on ‘36’!” The committee named in-
cludes: Dorothy Swearer, Edna Hor-
vitz, Helen Rose Gibson, Frances
Goodwin, and Ruth Richards, pianist.

This year the freshman class is de-
termined to put up a real battle, and
their re-hearsals have been well at-
tended. The committee representing
the freshmen includes: Barbara
Thomas, Betty Knop, Dorothy Oden-
heimer, Charlotte Atwell, Dorothy
Earl, and pianist, Marie Shaeffer.

Virginia Boyd, chairman, announced,‘

“I would like freshman women to
back the ﬁrst project of their class
with all the spirit and cooperation
they can possibly give.”

The criteria for judging follows:
Class spirit, 30 points; cleverness
and originality of presentation, 25
points; cleverness and originality of
words, 20 points; musical ability, 15
points; number of class in attend-
ance, 10 points. The judges named
by the chairmen are: Dean A. H.
Armbruster, Dr. M. C. Elmer, Dr. J.
J. Geise, Dr. S. H. Williams, and Dr.
W. R. Witz.

In order to accommodate the ex-
pected crowds, the building and
grounds committee will erect bleach-
ers in Heinz House, and it is import-
ant for each class that their section
be ﬁlled. Each class will provide
copies of the songs.

Speakers Slated
For Y Conference

 

 

Colleges Expected To Join Forum

fend the stand of socialism and com-
munism respectively,

John P. Bracken, chairman of the
conference, is arranging for speakers

Fascism. The Italian Embassy at
Washington, D. C., will probably fur-
nish a speaker for the defense of
Fascism.

The registration fee for out-of-town
students will be one dollar which will
include free lodging and breakfast
and participation in all the phases of
the conference. For local students a
fee of ﬁfty cents will be charged which

Chest Pledge Payment
Period Will End Today

All student pledges to the Student
Chest drive must be paid by today,
announces Homer Wadsworth, C35,
director of the drive.

The plan drawn up by \Vadsworth

to enable students to pay these
pledges is, as follows: Students
pledging in fraternities, English

classes or other special groups are to
see the person in charge of their
group and pay their pledge to that
person. Special booths will also be
placed on the campus in the various
buildings. A representative of the
Student Chest drive will be at these
booths during class hours.

Russian Students Recognize
Pitt International Club,
Open Correspondence

By Bernard Fleming

With the recognition of Russia
by America comes the recognition
of the University’s International
Relations club by the English
group of the Combinate of For-
eign Languages at Moscow,
USSR.

In a letter received by Dr. Ben
Williams of the political science
department, faculty director of
the International Relations club,
came the request for an exchange
of views on the present world po-
litical state with the English
group of the Combinate of For-
eign Languages.

The text of the letter received:
Friends:

The English group of the Com-
binate of Foreign Languages acci-
dently learned of your address
and decided to enter into collec-
tive as well as individual cor-
respondence with you.

The distance and the difference
in political systems of our coun-
tries will give us a great material
for exchange of experience.

When you receive this letter
we will already celebrate the six-
teenth anniversary of the Octo-
ber revolution. We’ll be very
glad to throw light upon all the
questions you are interested in.
This will lead to the strengthen-
ing of our friendship with you.

Our best regards.

In the name of the group,
Bella Levin, Iren Wikker,
Michael Rosenblit.

Council Proposes
New Activities
Program Points

Recommend Sixth Floor Oﬂices
In Cathedral, For Student
Publication Groups

 

Consideration of suggestions for a
new activity program featured the
meeting of Student council in the
Cathedral Tuesday evening. With
most of the original twelve-point plan
for the year already completed, the
group, through its executive commit-
tee, took up further projects for the
remainder of the term.

Among the work outlined was a
recommendation for the use of the
sixth floor of the Cathedral. In order
to eliminate the noise and congestion
of Room 801. the executive group sug-
gested sixth ﬂoor quarters for under-
graduate publications.

The second of the plans called for
student representation on the athletic
committee of the University. In the
discussion of the scheme, the point
was brought out that no students
have been included on the committee
for the past eight years,

Student voice in undergraduate ex-
pulsions and suspensions except those
for academic reasons was also_ sug-
gested. Reorganization of the point
scale system to revise present ratings,
and admission of students to the point
scale committee, were proposed for
consideration.

Further representation for students
was requested in proposals for an un-
dergraduate board of publications and
for a student athletic council super-
vising intramural sports. The ﬁnal

plan for undergraduates, which would’
be offered for a four-year term at a
reduced premium. _

Louis W. Linsley, E35, is the new
council treasurer, elected to replace
Bernard Curran, E34, who had re-
signed because of excess activities
points. Linsley will join the execu-'
tive committee at its next meeting for
further consideration of new plans.

C Cathedral Brain Trust
Cheers; Candyman
Keeps His Job

“Dad” Pryor, Pitt’s popular
candyman on the seventh ﬂoor of
the Cathedral, will be back at his
old post when classes start again
after Christmas vacation. The

good news ﬂew along the desks
of engineers working on plans, up
to the eighth ﬂoor where Panther
editors were writing jokes for the
next issue, and along the corri-
dors where ROTC men were con-
gregating on the eleventh ﬂoor.
“Dad” Pryor’s coming back and
the boys are happy!

A petition signed by 1,000 Pitt
students was circulated on the
day, a month ago. that “Dad” was
told he couldn’t have his seventh
ﬂoor stand. Ink-stained news-
hounds and the engineers’ “brain
trust" together worked on the pe-
tition to have “Dad” kept at Pitt.
And yesterday, all smiles, “Dad”
told a Pitt News reporter that the
world's all right and that he’s
coming back!

Senior Court Aids Study
Of University Traditions

 

Senior court at its last meeting de-
cided to co-operate with Fisk univer-
sity, Nashville, in a study of college
traditions. The purpose of the study
is to determine ways and means of
helping freshmen better to orientate
themselves. Fisk is collecting reports
from other colleges in regard to cus-
toms and traditions. Senior court has
offered Vade Mecum, Lantern Night
and other Pitt traditions for the
study,

also carry out the yuletide motif.
Dress is informal.
‘Tickets will be on sale all day to-

day for $1.50 per couple, the lowest

price, so far as is known, ever set for
this affair. The only other major
dance in recent years with an equally
inexpensive assessment was the
Sports dance of Spring Festival week
last semester, which more than 600
couples attended.

The committee members, the office
of the dean of men, William Daufen-
bach in Alumni hall, and the office of
the School of Dentistry will be selling
tickets throughout the day. The price,
which was originally a pre-sale price
meant to be in eﬁect only until noon
today, has been extended until 5
o’clock this afternoon. Although no
mention has been made of possibili-
ties of a door sale at the dance, it

flies been stated 011 good authority

that should such a sale take place,
the original price of $2 set for the

_affair would prevail.

Buhl’s band, which will occupy the

-orchestra platform until 1 o’clock, has

played for numerous fraternity affairs
here and at Carnegie Tech, and was
popularly received at the Interfrater-
nity Conference dance on November
25. Buhl and several members of the
unit are students at the University.

School Refuses
Federal Loan,
Says Chancellor

 

“University Can’t Meet $90,000
Interest Premium Yearly,”
States Dr. Bowman

By John D. Pauilus

“We are not, oing to put a cent
into the building of the Cathedral of
Learning until we have the money in
the -bank,” said Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, in an
interview in his office in State hall
Wednesday afternoon. Commenting
on the much-publicized loan from the
federal government to complete the
building, Dr. Bowman stated that no
money would be borrowed from the
government for this purpose.

The burden of a $90,000 a year in-
terest premium on the proposed fed-
eral loan makes such a ﬁnancial ven-

ture hardly possible, Dr. Bowman
stated. “If we should borrow enough
money to ﬁnish the building, we

would have to- pay $90,000 a year in-
terest, and we do not have the money.
I do not think such a venture is good
business,” Dr. Bowman said_

“No one wants that building ﬁnish-
ed more than I do,” the Chancellor
stated, “but I do not feel that we
should borrow from the federal gov-
ernment. Although I have not been
officially informed, the government
will want a first mortgage on the prop-
erty for the venture and would ask
an interest rate of between four and
ﬁve per cent.”

The question of a change in the
University charter does not enter into
the situation, the Chancellor said. “It
is a question of whether or not it is
good business, and I do not think it
is,” he said.

Stating that the University has the
good will of the community, and that
the Cathedral would be ﬁnished in due
time, free of ﬁnancial encumbrances.
Dr, Bowman emphasized the fact that
no federal aid for the completion of
the building would be accepted.

Christmas Spirit
Pervades Festive
Heinz House

Christmas spirit has invaded
Heinz House. The time-honored
tradition of “dressing up” the lit-
tle house on the hill has been
faithfully carried out except for
last year. ever since there has
been a Heinz House. This year
the main decoration is a picture
of Ra.phael’s “Madonna Del Se-
dia,” which hangs above the ﬁre-
place garlanded bv evergreens;
on either side of the mantle
bright red candles add color to
the decoration.

A seasonal pine fragrance
comes from eight candle-lit trees.
. The holiday atmosphere will be
the background for numerous sea-
sonal activities. Saturday after-
noon the children of faculty mem-
bers will enjoy the trees and a
period of games, and in the eve-
ning the WSGA commission will
have a party. Monday at 12:30
o’clock, the house will be open
to the YM-VVCA Christmas wor-
ship service, and Tuesday at noon
the Cwens will sponsor a bene-
ﬁt dance, to which admission will
be canned goods. At 3:30 o’clock
on the same afternoon a group
of children from Soho will be en-
tertained by the social service
departments of the YM-VVCA.
“Paints and Patches,” the newly
organized dramatic unit will also
hold a party at the House.

Running ‘the gauntlet (meaning

transfer physical education majors
underwent last night at Trees

tion majors.

Before the initiation, the pres-
ent PEP members treated the
futures to a big dinner —- for
evidently they believe in the
policy of “fattening before the

ciprocated by presenting a stunt
for the approval of the old mem-

Alumni Organize
Clubs Throughout
State, Country

 

Chancellor Bowman Approves
Proposed Constitution For
New Organizations

 

Formation of Pitt clubs under the
wing of the General Alumni associa-
tion is being carried on throughout
Pennsylvania and in other states.

Tentative organizations for Pitt
alumni clubs exist in the following
places: Philadelphia, Washington,
Harrisburg, Allentown, Meadville,
New Castle. Beaver Valley, Johns-
town, Greensburg, Altoona, and War-
ren; in Ohio. Cleveland and Youngs-
town; in Illinois, Chicago; in New
Jersey, Newark. It is expected that
permanent organizations for these
places will be formed early next
year.

First to organize is the Lackawanna
county Pitt club, which, at a meet-
ing in the Chamber of Commerce
building in Scranton, elected John J.
Harding, BA26, president; T. J. Ken-
nedy, D27, vice president; Hoty D.
Jones, GPh25, treasurer;
Fisher, BA2-3, secretary.

The object of these clubs is ex-
pressed in the blanket constitution
prepared by the Alumni association
and has been approved by Chancellor
John G. Bowman. The object stated
by the constitution reads:

“The object of this club shall be to
provide opportunity for helpful fel-
lowship, to promote a spirit of coop-
eration and loyalty among graduates
of the University of Pittsburgh, to
promote the welfare and interests of

the University, to foster close coop-

eration between the alumni and the
University, and to support and ad-
vance the cause of higher education,
.to the end that the graduates of the
University of Pittsburgh may render
sympathetic and effective service to
the communities in which they live.”
Under the blanket constitution the
membership of the Pitt clubs will be
divided into three classiﬁcations: (1)
Regular members, those who have
graduated and received degrees from
the University or from any of its an-
thorized and established schools or
(2) Associated mem-
bers, those who have attended the
University at least one year and
whose class has graduated from the
University. (3) Honorary members
shall be those who have received lion-
orary degrees from the University.
Another section of the constitution
deals with prospective students that
the alumni might contact for register-

ing at the University.

Croatian Women Sponsor

Committee Plans
Final Education
Entrance Needs

 

Intelligence And Health Ratings
Included In Standards Set
For Applying Students

Final plans governing admission
from a pre-education curriculum to
the School of Education will be work-
ed out by the executive committee of
the committee on admissions pro-
cedure to the School of Education at
a meeting this afternoon.

According to Theodore A. Siedle, as-
sistant to the dean of the School of
Education, the steps in the admission
procedure are now practically, deter-
mined. The meeting today will com-
plete the details and arrange for the
mechanics of administration.

In keeping with the changes made
in the organization in the School of
Education in September, 1932, stu-
dents who desire to prepare for teach-
ing are enrolled in pre-educa_tion cur-
ricula iii the college during their ﬁrst
two years. During their sophomore
year they are observed in key courses
and rated on the various characteris-
tics which are considered a part of a
good teaching personality.

A rating card speciﬁcally designed‘
for the pre-education group is being‘
worked out by the executive commit-
This form will be distributed to-
such classes as English 21, Education
3, Public Speaking 25, and Psychology
3. A composite of the ratings of dif-
ferent instructors will furnish a basis.
for determining a student’s possibili-
ties for admission to the School.

In order to determine the persons
interested in applying for admission
to the upper division years of the
School of Education, application
forms will be provided. Tentative ar-
rangements now indicate that formal
application will be made on April 1
by students who are completing their
sophomore year in June, and on No-
vember 1 by those who will complete
two years in a pre-education curricu-
_lum in February. This year there
will be no February group. The ﬁrst
applications will be ﬁled on April 1.

In addition to obtaining ratings on
personality characteristics, the results
of physical examinations, the general
_quality point average, and the spe-
ciﬁc attainments of-. students in their
major ﬁelds will be considered. Reg-
ulations provide that a student must
maintain a general average of C and
an average of B in a major subject-.

Non-Fraternity
Group Formed

 

To Eliminate Election Clause In,
Student Council Charter

 

One of the most signiﬁcant moves ‘~-
of a non-fraternity political group was -
made at a meeting called by Howard.‘
last Wednesday after--
noon, when this new group decided to I

Cohen, C34,

nity group on the campus during the;
next Student council election,

Cohen pointed out to the group the“
evil of the internal election clause in
the Student council charter which
provides that the seven senior mem-
bers of the council shall elect three
of the junior members to succeed
them. By electing three members
from the weakest schools, those in
which the power of the six fraternity
coalition is weakest, and the assur-
ance of a clean sweep in the con-
trolled schools, the coalition, has be-
fore the election has even begun, a
total of seven members favorable to
them in council. The election of one
other coalition members is compara-
tively easy and the coalition has a.
majority in council.

Only by eliminating this internal
election clause can a non-fraternity
group or any other group hope to
break the power of the present group
in council.

John P, Bracken, C34, urged the
group to drop all fraternity affilia-
tions, and that only by this means
could the group hope to gain any re-
spect from the non-fraternity student
body,

Students Grade
Liquor Bill Tests

Four State - Aided Universities
Score Civil Service Exams

An onslaught of job seekers will
descend upon the state tomorrow in
search of positions under the Pennsyl-
vania state liquor board, and Pitt is
prepared to do its share, as one of the
four state-aided universities, in grad-
ing and scoring the results of the
thousands of examinations.

The University, in conjunction with

Penn State, Pennsylvania, and Tem- ,

ple, the other three state—aided
schools, has been designated in the
recent state liquor bill to do the scor-
ing of the civil service examinations
given by the state department of in-
struction. Certain members of the
faculty and student body will begin
correcting the exams on Saturday as
soon as they arrive from the 40 dis-
tricts where they will be given. It is
estimated that it will take several
days for them to complete the task
and they will, therefore, continue to
work over the week—end.

Requirements For
Education School

(Continued From Page One.)

if he is to be admitted to the School.

Provision is made for a student to
remain in a School other than the
School of Education and still pursue
professional courses to become certi-
ﬁcated to teach. Such students, how-
ever, must pursue a major program of
study, in keeping with the speciﬁc re-
quirements outlined in the bulletin of
the School of Education; otherwise
they will not be permitted to do prac-
tice teaching under the direction of
the University. The qualiﬁcations of
students not applying for admission
to the School will be as carefully
scrutinized as are those who are ad-
mitted to the upper division of the
School of Education. Furthermore,
the professional courses in education
may be taken only when prerequisites
are satisﬁed.

If a student does not wish to apply
for admission to the School of Edu-
cation at the end of his sophomore
year, he may, according to Mr. Siedle,
still continue to take courses speci-
ﬁed by the education curricula. This
also applies to students who have
failed to gain admission to the School.
No guarantee, however, will be made
that any student, either in the School
of Education or in some other school
of the University, will be permitted
to pursue practice teaching, unless he
uneets the speciﬁc standards. These
include superior intelli-

view with a representative of the fac-
.ulty committee on admissions.

McCabe Reviews
Money Program

National Recovery Is Foreseen
In Inquiry Club Address

The nation is well on its way to re-
covery according to Dr. George K.
McCabe, assistant professor of eco-
Iiomics in tlie School of Business
Administration and authority on
ﬁnance, who addressed the Inquiry
forum Wednesday on Roosevelt’s
monetary program.

“The events of the past few months
lead me to believe that we are
deﬁnitely on the way to recovery,”
Dr. McCabe told Inquiry members.
“The rise in the price level is being
sustained; sales are increasing all
over the country; foreign trade is up
.20 per cent over last month; proﬁts
are reappearing; securities, mainly
stocks, reﬂect the general increase in
other branches of industry and busi-
ness; and, important to Pittsburgh,
the heavy industries—steel, railroads,
and building——show general improve-
ment,” Dr. M,cCabe ‘said.

Discussing brieﬂy the administra-
tion’s gold purchasing plan, Dr. Mc-
Cabe explained that it really is less
important in the whole program of rais-
ing prices than most people believe,

“It was instituted in the ﬁrst place
:as a last desperate resort to stimu-
late the sagging price level in Sep-
tember,” McCabe said. “It has suc-
ceeded, but,” he added, “the gold
purchasing plan, because of the small
supply of gold as compared With the
total wealth of the country, has little
~cl1ance of raising prices.”

Dr. McCabe concluded the address
with an outline of his own monetary
plan.

“l’d favor a. temporary stabilization
of the dollar at its present price,” Dr.
McCabe said. “This would regain
confidence and thus stimulate the re-
investment of money in securities,
which would naturally speed up recov-
ery all along the line,’' he said.

Professors Are Election

Judges For Steel Workers

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, assistant
professor of economics, and Theodore
A, Veenstra, instructor in statistical
research, have been in Weirton, West
Virginia, this week acting as election
judges for the steel workers of that
community, who are electing repre-
sentatives for collective bargaining
under the provisions of the NRA.

Dr. Daugherty and Mr. Veenstra
are assisting the National Labor
board in supervising the election. This
marks the second time that men from
the University have been chosen
through the Bureau of Business Re-
search to assist the NRA in estab-
lishing new labor codes. Dr. Daugh-
erty and Mr. Veenstra were among
those from the University who as-
sisted in the captive mines election
last month in the same region,

 

 

Pitt Panther Appears
With “Gift For
Every Buyer”

The Panther will be out on the
campus again Monday morning,
bedecked in the usual greens and
unusually violent reds of Christ-
mas, The spirit of Santa Claus,

osity has gone so far, in fact,

a Yule gift with his copy of the
magazine.

“Hello, Gracie,” the feature
which features the great Amer-
ican moron, will return, and illus-
trations of letters to Santa and
accompanying gifts will be scat-
tered throughout the issue.

Cagers Go West;
To Meet Purdue
In OpenerTonight

Tour Itinerary Also Includes
Northwestern, Butler;
Ten Make Trip

Embarking upon their ﬁrst and
most lengthy trip of the present sea-
son, the Pitt basketball players left
last night for Lafayette, Indiana,
where they will meet the Purdue cag-
ers tonight. Ten men made up the
party along with Coach Carlson and
Richard Wettach, manager. The play-
ers making the trip were Ochsenhirt,
McCamant, Cahrley Hughes, Skip
Hughes, Cribbs, Kuno, Roderick,
Noon, and Wainio. The tenth man
was to be a last-minute selection from
the quintet of Wilson, the two Groat
boys, Bond and Nickel.

Following the game with Purdue,
the Pitt team will move on to Evans-
ton, Illinois, for a game with North-
western Saturday evening. The team
will get a day's layoff over Sunday
and will then return to the state of
Indiana, where they will meet the
Butler university quintet at Indianap-
olis Monday night. After the Butler
game the party will entrain for Pitts-
burgh and arrive here Tuesday‘ morn-
ing. The trip calls for only two
nights of travel in sleepers, a plan
which gives the players a chance to
do most of their sleeping in hotel
rooms, a decided improvement over
the arrangements of last year's mid-
western jaunt.

This trio of games will test the
mettle of the Panthers. The records
of the past year indicate that Pitt has
found some stiff competition from the
rivals they are to meet on this trip.
The Golden yanthers held an eight-
point margin over Purdue in their
game last year and a ﬁve-point mar-
gin over the lads from Butler. North-
western took the home boys quite
handily winning a 31-22 decision,

The Pitt team will line up in the
same manner as in the Georgetown
game. This combination will have
McCamant and Skip Hughes at the
forwards, Cribbs at center, and Och-
senhirt and Charley Hughes at the
guard positions. There is more than
a remote possibility that Slim Wainio,
whose work stood out in the opening
game, may start at one of the for-
wards. This change will probably
send McCamant back to his old guard
berth, teaming him with Russ Ochsen-
hirt.

Purdue’s strength has not been test-
ed as yet, but the Boilermakers have
a habit of turning out teams good
enough to rank high in the Midwest,
a basketball hot-bed if there ever was
one.

Pitt Rid; Shoot Down
Metallurgist Gridders

The Pitt Riﬂes’ football team proved
to be too hot for the metallurgists to
handle in their game at the practice
ﬁeld last Friday. The ﬁnal score
stood 13-0 in favor of the soldiers.

The Riﬂe team overcame the re-
sistance of the metal pounders for
two touchdowns and a point after
touchdown. The Riﬂes swamped the
scoring chances of the metallurgists
each time they threatened.

E. F. Haverty, of the Riﬂes, was
the star of the day. His offensive
play was particularly good. The out-
standing star for the metallurgists was
their captain and manager, McDivers.
Outstanding on the defensive for the
Riﬂes was J. E. Tredennick_

Coach Corr Undecided As
Starting Lineup

 

With the swimming team out of
competition until after the Christ-
mas vacation, Coach I-‘at Corr is trying
to select the swimmers best suited
for each swimming event.

The backstroke and breaststroke
men are fairly certain. Jones and
Lindberg are most likely to start, but
there is a possible chance of using
Swazuk in the backstroke in place of
Lindberg, who could be used in any
of the freestyle events; relay, 50, 220,
4401, or the 100-yard race. Herman
Adlersberg and Joseph Schmeiler will
undoubtedly swim in the 200-yard
breaststroke.

In tl1e 440, and 220, Hanna, Lind-
berg, Denny, Swazuk, and Lewis are
all possible starters. Denny and Lind-
berg could also be used in the 100-
yard race. Other men who could
swim in the 100 or 50-yard races and
take points in any meet are: Stinner,
Ruhe, Madden, Adlersberg, Norton,
Schmeiler, and Lewis.

‘Harry Wagner and John Carik may
represent Pitt in the dive, but there
is a chance for Schmeiler to come
through and be a ﬁrst class diver.

Mike Sebastian To Play
In Annual East- West Tilt

 

 

Mike Sebastian, Panther halfback,
early this week accepted the invita-
tion of Andy Kerr, coach of the All-
East team, to play in the annual East-
West game New Year’s Day in San
Francisco.

He is the third Panther play-
er to have been invited to make the
trip west, Walton and Skladany hav-
ing accepted last week.

Sebastian had previously accepted
an invitation to play in the North-
South game in New York on New
Year’s Day. He cancelled his plans
for playing there when he accepted
the invitation to go to the coast.

Veteran Boxers
Fight For Berths

Mittmen Face Tough Competition
In Every Class But Two

 

After a. few weeks of boxing prac-
tice a number of new men have shown
enough skill and promise to make the
team berths of a last years’ veterans
anything but certain.

In the 135-pound weight division,
Kronick, a clever boxer who uses his
head, is giving Giannatti, a letterman
from last year plenty of competition.
Vissat and Kopp, at present seem to
be taking care of the 165 and 175-
pound classes.

In the 115-pound class Junge is
back from last year’s team. He is a
greatly improved boxer, and will make
it tough for any boxer he faces_

John Brallier, although lacking in
experience, is a fast 125-pound man.
Coach Orsini’s 155-p-ound class is well
taken care of by Jack Schricker. The
candidates for the heavyweight class
will have to beat Arnold Greene if
they hope to represent Pitt in the
heavyweight ﬁghts.
