In a clear signal of ebbing ‘pa-
tience and political frustration,
President Carter has announced a
four.part plan to deal with Iran and
the hostage situation.

The basics ‘of Carter’s plan in-
clude:'1) severing diplomatic rela-
tions with Iran (all diplomats must
leave the United (States by midnight
yesterday), 2) increased economic
sanctions, 3) freezing of all Iranian
assets in the United States,’and 4)
suspension of the visa process for
Iranians trying to enter the United

 States, except’ -for medical and

As the hostages begin their l58th

day of captivity, there is still a great
deal of puzzlement as to the key to
Iranian acquiescence.

State Department’s Iran Working
Group said, “We’ve been through

five or six policy flips already. It’s ‘

and it doesn’t happen. Through this
whole thing, first it’s been yes, then
it’s no, then it’s maybe.” . ~

Dr. Merton Bland, also on the
Iran Working Group, felt that the
steps were ‘a good _start to a solution
of the situation.

“The current line of procedures
was getting us nowhere,” he said.

By CINDY COHEN
'Pitt News Staff Writer

It has been over five months
since the capture of the
American Embassy in‘ Tehran.
The situation has escalated with
President Carter’s new proposal
and the severing of diplomatic
relations with Iran.

The reaction from Tehran was
less than contrite. The Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini said that
this break in relations was a
“good omen” and although
there is some concern about
possible shortages and ration-
ing, Khomeini and Foreign
Minister Gotbzadeh said sanc-
tions did not change their posi-
tion on the hostages.

_‘ Iranian president Bani-Sadr
said Iranians should be prepared
for “steadfastness, self-sacrifice

and action” also adding, “If

‘you want to be alive, produce
and work.”

The Ayatollah added, “The
breaking of relations-with Iran is
the one thing in all his life that

the offical radio noted he has called
for appointment of an outside
observer to oversee their condi-
tions.

Iranian television Tuesday night
showed ﬁlm of the hostages as they
were visited last Sunday .by three
American clergymen who presided
at Easter services in the embassy.

In the film the hostages appeared
in generally good spirits, although
some seemed nervous, as they chat-
ted with the visiting ministers. "

Khomeini told Iranians that
Carter’s break in relations was a
“good omen” because it meant the

the oppressed. It marks the end
of ties between a risen country
and a world-devouring
plunderer,” he said. -“This is the
beginning of the dawn of final
victory of a nation against the
bloodthirsty superpower‘ which
was forced to cut relation and
end its pillaging.” ’

Dr. Richard Cottam, noted
Iranian expert, said “There are
people in Iran who" have been -
working very hard to get on with
the business of building their
country. Our government had
been dominated by those who
want good and easy relations
with Iran, but their Iranian
counterparts failed when Kho-
meini pulled the rug out from
under them.”

“What they underestimated
was the intensity of Khomeini’s
views of the United States,
especially his views on the need
of getting rid of the U.S.” Cot-
tam added. ,

The central issue fsurrounding
the initial capture of .the em-

United States had lost all hope of
controlling Iran.

The ruling Revolutionary Coun-
cil met in an extraordinary session
Tuesday with provincial governors
general to discuss steps that should
be taken as a result of Carter’s new
sanctions.

Council spokesman Hassan
Habibi said they were considering a
“holy war” that might mean ra-
tioning of consumer goods, putting
a lid on wages and clamping down
on hoarders and others causing
shortages in domestically produced
goods.

Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,
an issue which may have been a
red herring all along.

“I was told. long ago that
Khomeini knew we couldn’t

.retirrn the shah.’ So the point

wasn’t .a real one, but Khomeini
thought that we needed a lesson.
The hostages willremain captive
until he thinks that we have
learned our lesson,” Cottam
said.

\“As faras the sanctions are
concerned, they really won’t be
effective unless all‘of Europe

« joins in and they won’t because

they need oil,” he said. “Iran
does have a fairly good economy
anyway, and it is going to be
hard to restore diplomatic rela-
tions eventually because of
anger.”

As far as U.S. policy is con-

’ cerned, Cottam said, “For the

last two months we have follow-
ed the best possible policy to
strenghten the moderates, but

./Khomeini «wouldn't go along
if g with them.”

By WALTER R. WATSON

- Pitt News Staff Writer

Pollster_ George Gallup said
"last week Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan appear to have the nomina-
tions‘ of their respective parties.

Gallup spoke last Tuesday night
to a gathering in the Student
Union.’s Kurtzman Ballroom, shar-
ing inforrnatin compiled by the‘
Gallup Poll. The lecture was spon-
sored by the Pitt Union Program
Council. »

Gallup said the number of in-

”;"dependent voters have grown at a

faster.-rate than the Deomocratic or
Republican parties. Gallup have
the results of a survey that found

Republican Presidential Candidate ~

‘John Anderson to be well liked by
both Democrats and Republicans,
but strongest among the in-
A dependents. '

Gallup said President Carter’s_

popularity "has rapidly decreased
since early December, just after the
Iranian crisis.

Gallup told the crowd that the
popularity of the president tends to
rise and fall in six month intervals.

“By June, Mr. Carter’s populari-
ty willgo up to about the level it was
in December (61 percent). The
results from a survey that were just
completed Sunday see the President
as having 39 percent of the
American public behind him.
Again, the major consideration by

‘ the majority of the public is the Ira-

nian crisis, they’re becoming more
andmore impatient with the situa-
tion and tend to want stronger steps
taken by the government,” Gallup
said.

“Senator Edward Kennedy's sur-l

prising victories in New York and
{Connecticut have not__ crystallized
“into a nation-wide surge. Chappa-

. quidick has. hampered his chances‘

throughout the primaries and he

hurt his bid for nomination by some
of his comments regarding the [ra-
nian crisis and the shah,” Gallup
said.

Gallup made five predictions of
trends in the 1980s. He predicted
that “voter apathy will be with us in
the 80s, voting participation in 18-,
19-, and 20-year-olds will continue
to be discouraging. A lot of the
apathy is to blame on a distrust of
government and the mudslinging

_ that takes place in campaigns.”

His second prediction was that
one out of every five people will
move away from the cities and one
out of every three will move from
the country’s major cities due to
fear of crime.

His third prediction was that
there will be a growing drug pro-
blem, especially alcohol abuse.

Gallup claimed that half of all
murders are drug-related, half of all
deaths are drug-related, with the
same holding true for. half of the
country's divorces. He said that he
wished that the liquor industry
would discontinue the “glamorizing
od drinking,” and that parents

. should be re-educated in dealing

with drug abuse in the home.

The fourth trend that Gallup saw
was a high crime rate in the 80s. He
pointed the major cause as being
the high number of youth
unemployment. In a recent Gallup
poll, it~was found that 18 year olds
were in favor of voluntary of man-
datory service of their country.
Gallup also stated that youth
favored non-military service over
military service “ever so slightly.”

The final trend that Gallup found
in this decade was the growing
distrust in big business. He blamed
young people with “grossly
overestimating the amount of profit
and taxes payed by private
industry.” - . ‘

Gallup explained how the Gallup
Poll was run. He said that the poll
is conducted by a process of
modified probability sample devis-
ed at the poll’s headquarters in

Princeton, New Jersey. He said the-

representative sample of the United
States used in the Gallup Poll
surveys was 1500 people.

“The reason we use the number
1500, is because we’ve found it to
be the best number for our pur-
poses,” Gallup said.

Gallup said his group has divided
the ocuntry into seven areas. Inter-
viewers are sent to the blocks‘ in
each town which have been deter-
mined as random samples for that
part of the country. The inter-
viewers go to every -fourth house or
every tenth house on that block, (or
any other interval).

“Every 10th sport of 100 blocks
in .a geographic area we pick; it
follows a highly complicated pro-
cess to keep it (the samples) ac-
curate,” Gallup said. .

“About 90 percent of theinter-

viewers work for us, and sometimes -

we hire professional interviewers to
help areas that are hard to get peo-
ple from the Gallup organization
into,” he said. The selection of age
and sex is left to the discretion of
the interviewer, we may tell him
that we want “x” number of men
or women interviewed. Princeton
decides the rest.” '

Gallup concluded on a happy
note, reporting that prejudice of
race, creed,'and color, had decreas-
ed greatly in the U.S.

“A growing amount of tolerance
has been caused by the growing
number of 'people/with a college
education. I The public is not
discouraged,” Gallup said.

I Volcano Makes For

Explosive Humor

TACOMA, Wash.—The
volcanic activity at Mount St-
Helens has touched some fun-
nybones.’ Denny MacGougan of

_ the Tacoma News Tribune collected

these from local punsters: A
—Professor George Nock of the
University; of Puget Sound Law
School suggested -that if the volcano
were toproduce a spectacular erup-
tion, the university should give it a
degree—"‘Magma Cum Loudly.”
-Ed West contendedlthe steam
and ash eruptions were originally
scheduled for last October, “but

2 God couldn’t get his Environmental

Impact Statement filed on time.”

—C.C. Clouse suggested the
government drop bombs filled with
peanuts and popcorn into the
crater, so an eruption would pro-
duce a shower of snacks. .

—Rick Van Cise, KTNT Radio’s
night disc jockey, suggested a major
eruption might be ‘ prevented by
smearing the volcano with a pimple

‘ cream .

Blockade of Persian Gulf

U.S. Calls for Support fromA|lies:’

eOil Supplies Could Be Jepardized i 

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The Carter
administration, raising anew the
possibility of a blockade of the Per-
sian Gulf, warned U.S. allies Tues-
.day that their oil supplies could be
jeopardized unless they cooperate

‘in pressuring Iran to free its 50

American hostages. _,
The question of new action
against Iran arose when White
House press secretary Jody Powell
was asked to assess the reaction of
U.S. allies to President Carter’s an-

' nouncement Monday of new sanc-

tions, including the breaking of
diplomatic ‘relations with the
Tehran government. . ,
I _ “We will be awaiting with in-
terest their response in this matter,”
Powell said. Then he added:

“To the extent that they support
us in these efforts, the crisis is more

. likely to be resolved without the

necessity of additional actions
\which could involve additional risks
for all concerned.”

Powell characterized his
reference to possible additional ac-
tion as
policy.”

“a clear statement, of‘

Asked if he could be more
specific about additional actions,
Powell replied, “I could be but I’d
rather not be at this point.” ,

However, itvwas understood that
options for future action that are

considered open by the administra-_

tion include a naval blockade of

‘ Iran’s sea routes or the mining of its

oil ports. ~

Either move would have a major
impact on U.S. allies who are heavi-
ly dependent on imports of Iranian
oil. Powell’s remarks came shortly
after the State Department issued a
warning to U.S. allies that their
Iranian oil supplies could be placed
in danger if they do not support
new sanctions. -

Iranian officials have strongly in-

dicated they will cut off, oil
shipments to any country that joins
in the US; sanctions. ’

The public warnings were issued
as American diplomats talked to of-
ficials in several dozen countries,
asking them to impose trade sanc-
tions of their own against Iran.

The FBI shadowed Iranian
diplomats as they made ar-

by'President Carter when he broke ”

diplomatic relations with Iranon
Monday.’ - --

The State Department placed ‘
precise, limits on travel forthe 35 ‘

diplomats affected by Monday's ex-'
pulsion order, allowing them to

travel no more than two miles from_ __- -

home or work.

_ Another 209 Iranian soldiers in
military training courses were also
required to leave.. Officials said
some Iranians had asked, for
political asylum, but ‘as of mid-
afternoon, no requests had been ap-
proved. They refused to give
details. A ' " .

Carter announced thedecisuion to

break relations with Iran in a televi- ,

sion’addre'ss,Monday. At the same
time, he announced new economic

. sanctions in an effort to pressure

the Iranian government. to release
the 50 Americans who have been
held hostage since the U.S. Em-
bassy in Tehran was overrun by
militants on Nov. 4.

C @112 iﬂitt Nana
The student newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh. Editorialopinions areimade

« by a majority of the editorial board. Opinions expressed in columns are those of the
author and not neccesarily of The Pitt News staff. E

There is a new book in town, authored by Director
of Student Activities Andy Smith and titled, simply,
“Control.” '

For a condensed version of this masterpiece...

, Chapter One

Shortly following Smith’s arrival on the P-itt cam-
pus in mid-August he began his quest appointing
himself adviser to the Student Government Board,
the group that only last week voted to revoke the
right of its standing committees to elect their own
chairmen.

Chapter Two

Last week Smith announced a proposal to revamp

the existing Media and Publications Board (the body

that oversees the operation of the campus radio sta-
tion, newspaper, literary magazine and yearbook)
constitution‘. Among the proposal’s clauses are pro-

visions to abolish the annual internal elections each .

group holds to select chief officers. Under the revis-
ed proposal, the officers would be appointed by the
Media Board. Also mentioned in the proposal is the
right for the board to have some input to the editorial
policy of the various groups. Smith, who also
assisted in draftig the proposal would the first line of
veto power over any policy or budgetary matter
brought before the board.
Chapter Three

Work has already begun on a proposal similar to S

the Media and Publications document to govern the
Pitt Union Program Council. Smith, along with
assistant Director of Student Activities and adviser to
the program council Joyce Giangarlo and “selected”
students are working to polish the document.
' Chapter Four - O

Smith once again looks to the governmental
bodies, asking that the College of General Studies
Student Cabinet make itself reportable to him. ,

Although the cabinet presently operates under the
auspices of a student agent, a paid employee of the

cabinet who tends to the students’ administrative '

duties, Smith wants the cabinet to become directly
responsible to either ‘himself or the dean of the Col-

 News

Page 8—Wednesday, April 9, 1980*?

lege of General Studies. He offered these choices of ‘

administrative control to CG‘S president Dave Huff-
ner. « .

And so the saga.goes on and on and on...

The question remains of what lies ahead, or should
we say what organization is next to come on the
chopping block.

. Smith who has already managed to bring the
government underhis auspices, is attempting to put
the media under some indirect control and'is seeking
in the future to even control the students’ source of
entertainment. "

Could the Greeks be next? Several fraternities
, have already been given notice that they must move
from their houses (houses owned by the university) at

the end of the term. ._ .

And what about the Black Action Society? Could
the type of solidarity march successfully planned and
carried out last month become a thing of the past
when ‘administrative controls are instituted?

The resident students have already lost some of
their rights this year and the commuters, the group
that represents 60 percent of the student population,
cannot even.be recognized_as a governance group by
the, Student Government Board. _

It is time for the students to step back and collec-
tively scan the activities that serve to infringe not
only on theirrights but also on the educational ex-
perience afforded them by participating in
democratically functioning student organizations.

Atthis point Smith’s book is unfinished.

That ending and the overall success of his work lies
in thehands of all students involved in student ac-
tivities at Pitt. -

The final chapter. of that book could include a
group of student organizations—government and
media, dangling from the apron strings of the ad-‘
ministration.

Or it could find a group of strong independent

. students willing and-able to govern themselves, deter-

minetheir own policies and elect their own leaders.
How will that final chapter read?

with tuberculosis, I needed‘ to

receive a tine test. I called the"

Health Service, and the receptionist
told me to come in without an ap-
pointment. Upon arrival at 4:45,
the receptionist ‘took my name and

A said there would be’ about a half

hour wait. J After more than an
hour, I was called in. The test took

’ about one minute. '

I had to return to have the test
read within 72 hours, so I again

.'visited the Health Service two days

later. I had a forty minute break at

 

at least forty minutes. She told me

'to return and, in essense, “try my

luck” later. I returned at 7:50 
and was informed the wait would be
a half of an" hour. ‘ .

While waiting, I observed as the
receptionist informed everyone that
there was at least a half of an hour
wait. One girl, frustrated with a
situation similar to mine, left the
office without being tested after 45
minutes. Once again, after more
than an hour, I was called in for one

‘minute. -

I found that, at three different
times, the length of the waiting line
seemed to be at_ least one hour. I
recommend one of two alternatives.
The Health Service could employ a

,.

nurse who specifically performs

care such as tests to shorten this un- _

necessary waiting. Alternately,
they could allow one to make an ap-
pointment to see a nurse. I found
myself waiting in back of four or
ﬁve others who had appointments
to see doctors.

Coupled with the hour wait came
the discovery that my student health
fee "does not cover the testing for
tuberculosis unless I need the test to
be admitted to a school or program.
Upon seeing the nurse, she inform-
ed me that the tine test would cost
S3. A _

It has been mandatory that I pay
the health fee with my tuition every

term for three years. I have paid

$16 each term. I don’t know where

my $96 for the past three years has
gone, but it certainly should have
paid for a simple test. I expect effi-
cient service and that the the Health
Service fee cover minor problems
such as being tested. If this is not
the case, the fee should be optional.

Wednesday, April 9, 1980-I-Page 9

f

The March 25 issue of The Pitt
News ran a correction asserting that
Rob Toy, a member of the Young
Socialist Alliance, said “the Afghan
peasants are heroin dealers and op-
pressors of women’s rights.”

First, there is no member of the
YSA narned Rob Toy. Secondly,
the YSA does not "believe that
Afghan peasants are heroin dealers
and oppressors of women’s rights.”

The way that The Pitt News

. covers the role of Soviet troops in

Afghanistanis similar to the way

‘the U.S. big business press covers

this question. Most of this coverage
is based on lies, fictitious people,
and twisted assertions——and needs
constant corrections.

One of the many possible ex-
amples was the media coverage of
the events in Kabul at the end of
February, including the shutdown
by some merchants and other
rightist activities. The Neward, New

. Jersey Star Ledger ran a banner

headline in its February 29 issue:
“I000 Afghans Marchine-Gunned
in Reprisal.” It went on to report
that Soviet troops had herded up
and summarily executed Moslem
Shiite leaders and others in a “reign
of terror” and that many Soviet
troops had also been killed. Reports
similar to this appeared in
newspapers and TV newscasts
around the country presented as
fact.

However, soon after, CBS, The
New York Times and others
reported that no massacre had
taken place, that Soviet troops had
played only a supportive role in the

develop that country.

Especially after the new govern-
ment’s land reform program got
under way, armed action began
against it. These guerrilla bands are
portrayed as “Muslim rebels” op-
posed to an “atheist” regime. This
is another of Washington’s

~fa1sifications. The majority of the

country’s population who support
the government are also Muslims.
And as the London Economist ad-
mitted last year, “no restrictions
had been imposed on religious prac-
tice” (Sept. 11, 1979).

The real reasons for the fighting
lie elsewhere. Who are these so-
called Muslim rebels?‘ They are
former feudal landlords, former
military officers, monarchists,
opium and heroin dealers,
smugglers, money lenders, and
others whose privileges and power
are threatened by the gains of the
majority. I

An “Afghan rebel leader” proﬁl-
ed in the Jan. 8 Wall Street Journal
for example, turns out to be a rich
landlord with 35 houses. He is
fighting because the new govern-
ment took over 34 of his houses, ex
plaining that he needed only one.
Rather than see their profits go
down the drain and their poppy

fields turned toward other produc-
tion, the drug traffickers opened a
guerrilla war against the new
regime. A report in the April 30,
1979 issue of McLean’s magazine, a
Canadian weekly, stated: “Feudal
landlords whose holdings are
threatened with confiscation by the
Afghan government are bringing
the produce from their poppy crops
into Pakistan, and use the proceeds
to buy riﬂes, explosives and other
weapons.”

Unable to launch a direct military

intervention because of the deep ,

anti-war sentiment of the American
people, Washington has sought to
carry out its operations through in-
termediaries. In this case it has
mainly been through the U.S.
dominated military dictatorship in
Pakistan. The Pakistani govern-

ment provides bases for the right '

wing guerrillas, money to buy arms,
military training, and free access
across the Afghanistan border.

' Evidence has also appeared in the
international press that the CIA is

.directly involved in the training of

Afghan rightists.

With this powerful group of in-
ternational forces arrayed against
the revolution, the Afghan govern-
ment turned to the Soviet Union for

for herself.

A girl becomes a woman
when she assumes responsibility

  
  

aid. Money and advisors were pro-
vided. When it looked like the
imperialist-backed forces might pull
off a Chile-style counter-revolution
right on its Southern border, Soviet
troops came in.

So the issue is not Soviet in-
tervention, but a growing U.S. in-
tervention aimed at taking back the
gains won by the Afghan masses
which finally" forced the Soviet
government to respond.

The threat to peace is Carter’s
campaign to aid the right-wing

 YSA Member Questions Media's Coverage of Afghan Situation

Afghan guerrillas, to beef up the
Pakistani dictatorship, to establish
military bases in the Middle East
and Africa, and to squander more
billions on the war budget.

The way to peace is to support
the gains of the Afghan masses and
to reject and attempt by the U.S.
government to intervene either
directly or indirectly.

land-locked country about the size
of Texas, is one of the world’s
poorest countries. Annual per
capita income is $160.‘ It was long
ruled by a— repressive and corrupt
monarchy, replaced in 1973 by a
dictatorship under Mohammed
Daoud. With economic power in
the hands of big landowners and a
few capitalists, Afghanistan was a

land of inequality and oppression. WOMEN'S HEALTH

Daoud developed closer and
closer ties tothe Shah of Iran and
the U.S. government. The Shah's
dreaded secret police, SAVAK,

_ moved into Afghanistan to hunt

down suspected political dissidents.
The death penalty was imposed for
opposition political activities.
Then, in -April 1978, the Afghan
masses rose up and fought to
change these oppressive conditons.
Tens _
workers and peasants took to the
streets a section of the army rebell-
ed and a new government came‘ to
power. It announced and began to
implement a series of important
social reforms:
—l.4 million acres of land
distributed free to 248,000 peasant
families. ~ -
——debts cancelled to landlords that
benefitted three million peasant
families.
—trade unions legalized for the first
time.
—oppressed nationalities allowed‘
newspapers in their own languages
for the first time.
-—massive literacy campaign.
—out1awing the sale of female
children and extending compulsory
schooling to include young women.
Washington’s response to these
social improvements was to cut off
all economic aid programs to
Afghanistan. American_ officials

Law Schoo‘ I
To Hold  
Competition

The final oral argument of
this year’s intra-scholastic ap-
pellate court competition will be
held today at 8 p.m. in the Law
School courtroom. This year’s
problem involves statutory in-
terpretation of secion 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973
which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of handicap or
disability by any institution
receiving - federal financial
assistance.

The arguments will be heard
by the “Supreme Court of the
United States” on writ of cer-
tiorari to the Twelfth Circuit
Court of Appeals. The Twelfth
Circuit had «ruled: (1) prior ex-
. haustion of federal ad-
ministrative remedies is not a
prerequisite to civil suit under
section‘504,‘and (2) the Act im-
poses an affirmative action duty
to hire the disabled upon all
employers within itsambit.

The panel of judges for the
final round will consist of three
distinguished jurists: Honprable
Ruggero J . Alidisert, Third Cir-
cuit; Honorable Joseph F. Weis,
Jr., Third Circuit; and
Honorable Lawrence W.
Kaplan, Common Pleas.

The final round participants
will be: Donald Pier and Wayne
Babcock, representing. the Peti-
tioner; and James Poerio and
Samuel Grego, representing the
Respondent.

, To be an All-America is an ac-
complishment which most people
never get a chance to experience.
But, for four women on Pitt’s
V swimming team, it became a reality.
Last weekend, Pitt’s women, who

3 meet, traveled toyleas Vegas for the
 National Competition. The

_ No one faired as well as Amy

‘ events. ‘Jackson was sixth in the

  Baseball Situation May Cause Abmpt End To Season  

Despite the fact that the 1980 major league
baseball season will open on schedule, it is in
desperate trouble. In what the players have called a
-“good faith” move, they postponed the strike

deadline to May 22, instead of opening day. The, I

deadlock between the Players Association and the
owners stems from mainly one issue: player compen-‘
sation for free agency. Both sides ‘are so adamant in
their positions that cancellation of‘ the, season, at the
moment, seems to be the only result possible. i

Baseball right now has a compensation clause on
the books. It is simplythat if team ‘A’ loses a player
to team ‘B’ viathe free agent route, team ‘A’ gets a
draft pick from team ‘B’ in compensation. It is very

the owners wanted to control free agency,’it could be
done without the new proposal. They would have to

refrain from meeting players demands. If every

Patemo Looks Forward 1

To Upooning Season

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA — “I’m kind
of excited,” Joe Paterno said today
as he started his 15th season as head
football coach at Penn State with
spring drills.

“I’m pleased with the way the
squad worked during the winter to
keep in good physical condition,”
Paterno noted. 6 V

“And I think the squad is ex-
cited," Paterno observed. .

What’s all the excitement about?
What makes this spring different
than any other spring?

Patemo didn’t use the word, but
he intimated that both the coaching
staff and the players realized that
the Lions’ image as a football
power with student athletes was at
stake. ' ' .

Paterno had a number of
disciplinary problems last season,
uncommon to his program. Still, he
produced an 8-4 team, which went
to the Liberty Bowl and beat Tulane
9-6. But State missed the nation's
Top 10 list for the first time in many
years. i

"I think the staff is better
prepared,’ said Paterno, who since
last season has taken on the added
duties of athletic director. “We’re
not confused as to what offense we
want to use. .

“And we had a good recruiting
year despite the adverse publicity in
1979,” Paterno said. ..

“That’s why we're really excited.
“We have the toughest schedule
since I’ve been here but I think we
can have a good football team. We

The schedule starts Sept. 6 with
Colgate and runs through Texas

Maryland, Syracuse, West Virginia,

Patemo explained that he had ad-
justed to handling the dual role of
athletic director and coach. He ex-
plained that he had ample help and

didn’t have to bother with the nuts;-E,

and bolts operation of the athletic
department. He would, however,
formulate the policy.

Paterno’s biggest problems this
spring are finding replacement for
defenders Bruce Clark, Matt Millen
and Lance Mehl, and offensive
stars Matt Suhey, Mike Guman and
Tom Donovan. The coach believes
he has the ‘,‘hor-ses.”

“We have a lot of work to do
before we can say how competitive
we’ll be,” Patemo cautioned. “But
I’ll say the will is there, the poten-
tial is there.”

Paterno noted that he hadn’t
seen the team since the Liberty
Bowl game, but that he had the feel-
ing it was a better squad overall
than it was at this time last year or
at the ‘Liberty Bowl in Memphis,
Tenn. . '

Hebert, the squad clinched a berth
in the Eastern playoffs.

Pitt will travel to Princeton on
April 18 and 19 to compete in the
Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League playoffs.

By defeating a tough George
Mason team on George Mason’s
home court, the Panthers took top
honors in Division II Conference

The resignation came as universi-
ty officials completed an internal
investigation into issues raised by
two Tucson newspapers.

Included were two copyright
reports in The Arizona Daily Star
last week that Mason and six assis-
tant coaches ﬁled expense vouchers
with the university for about $4,800
for airline tickets that were not used
and for recruitment trips that never
were taken.’ 9 I

Sunday, the Star quoted state

play and received an automatic bid
into the ECVL tournament.

The Panthers defeated George
Mason three games to one, by
scores of 15-11, 6-15, 15-7 and 15-7'.
The victories boosted the Panther’s
conference record to an overall 7-0

"and placed George Mason in third

place with a 5-3 record. Princeton is
right behind Pitt with a 6-1 record,
with Princeton and Pitt having a

Sen. Luis Gonzales, D-Tucson, as
saying there seemed to be “some
sort of cover-up” involved since
university officials had made aware
of the allegations some time ago but
had taken no action.

Last week Mason said he and
some assistants had charged the
university for trips never taken but
-said it was “not for personnal pro-
fit.” Instead, he said, thecoaches
were seeking to cover expenses for

Spikers Prepare For
Eastern Playoffs

(Continued fror/n Page 15)

Baird and Danny O’Donnell per-
formed superbly for the Panthers
all year.

Hardin and Baird were thought
to have put in a superior match last
weekend.

“Both Don (Hardin) and Dave
(Baird) played exceptional matches
against George Mason,” said.
Hebert.-“With Don blocking and
Dave setting, their performances
were very consistent throughout the
four game match.”

The win and the overall perfor-

- mance of the Panthers throughout
“ the season should place them third

in. Eastern volleyball behind

' Rutgers-Newark and Penn State.

“Going into the ECVL next
weekend, I look for us to be seeded
fourth with our automatic berth,”
said Hebert. “This competition will
field a total.of eight teams ‘and will
decide who will represent the East
in the nationals.”

Beavers, who has been a veteran
of Pitt volleyball since the days of
club status four years ago, is im-
pressed with the improvements that

' the Panthers have shown in the last

year of. play.

“I think that we have shown a
full turnabout from a year ago,”
said Beavers. “Last year we were in
our first year and did not pose a
threat to too many teams until the
end of the season, when things
began to jell together. This year,
though, things are entirely dif-
ferent. We have opened eyes of
many Eastern teams in our division
and in Division I ball. I think that
that is someting to be recognized in
just one short year.”

The victory for the Panthers
deﬁnitely puts Pitt on top of
Eastern collegiate volleyball, with
both men and women bringing the
name of Pitt to volleyball circles in
the East.
