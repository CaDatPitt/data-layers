‘Fines Violators

Captain Charles i=.a'y,'h‘ee'a of
the University security depart-
ment; stated‘ that‘ 116 cars have

been ‘towed away since the "Uni-
nversity enforced the_ new park-

- ingy regulations "two weeks ago.

Before “the operation of estab-
lished towing procedures by the
University was enforced, every-
-one was notiﬁed ‘in The Pitt News
and the weekly University direc-
tory” accordingto Capt. Ray,
, Automobiles are towed to Nel-
son’s garage, ‘a ﬁve story build-
ing located behind Mellon Insti-
tute on Fifth Ave. Cars can only
be retrieved for a $9.25 ﬁne. ‘

' ' No Way Out

Captain Ray commented, “There ,

is no way out and special re-
quests lmustibe ignored. The Uni-
versity po1ice.don’t mess around.
We rea1ly.mean it.” —
‘Any unidentiﬁed automobiles
parked in these restricted park-
ing spaces which are designated
by a white sign will" be prose- _
cuted. These parking spaces are
reserved for faculty and ad-
ministrative personnel who pay
$17.50 fora parking permit. At
present "there are not enough
-Parking spaces to meet the
needs of the faculty. '

These parking restrictions refer
to any private parking lot owned
by the University.

Only Effective Way

Captain Ray further stated, “It’s
a little rough but it is the only
way we ﬁnd effective." _

There have been so many vio-
lations since the program was
started two weeks ago that the
University police, ‘because of a
lack of facilities have not been
able to prosecute all violators.

Discrinnninatio-I1 Policy

C _. (see Editorial, Pager)’

The faculty of the University’s_»School of Medicine ‘last week
reinforced the anti-discrimination stand it took two years ago. With
theiformulation of a’ policy of non-support of University functions at
clubs practicing racial discrimination, the medical school. has set

. the pace for further clariﬁcation of the University’s policy the last
two years. i " A ‘ A
' The "original stateymentu read: ‘_‘I-lenceforth, the faculty. of the
school of medicine will not engage in or support University acti-
, vities of any nature, official, or semi-ofﬁcial, which are conducted in
private town or country clubs which"use racial orreligious criteria
as a basis for membership.” ' ‘ ’ I

, , _ vNot as Strong as Intended _

A spokesman for the University commented that the ‘medical
school's resolution was in tune with Chancellor Litcl1field’s state-
ment of University policy on discrimination last February. This A
general Universitylpolicy. was issued afteriseveral other schools
followed the medical 'school’slead.l Itmerely‘ stated that the Uni.
versity does not discriminate on racial or religious grounds, but
that individual schools must interpret it for themselves. ,

The medical school has considered a restatement of its original
' since last May. The original action was inspired by City ‘Councilman
James A. ’.Iordon’s complaint of discrimination at a "luncheon at the

In The Spuotlight  

With Stan Schweiger

Step right up, folks! lt’s time to place your bets on the

ii" ﬁlly of the year. Who will be the Belle of the Box Oﬁice?

This event is a match race between those gold-dust lassies of
the silver screen, Luscious Liz and Dainty Dod’o. Included
among those heave plungers who will decide the winner of

* the race are assorted American bankers, Swiss bankers, and

audiences the world over. If ,thei1¢

latest races are an indication of
the eventual champion, I see
Dainty Dodo scampering home in
a‘ boat race (or is that on a
barge?).

The “Cleopatra 'Handicap” is
the biggest race of its kind in the
history of equestrian economics.
Luscious Liz is in trouble the en-
tire route although her silks are
gorgeous and her bridle is ex-
quisite. Her opponents number
just two, and they prove to be two
too many for her to handle. Sexy

A Rexy is the winner of this race

by a landslide. He struts his stuff
magniﬁcently and forcefully. His
presence is made known from the

.moment he gets out on the track

and he dominates every minute of
running time. He prances, snorts
and whinnys with the style and
grace worthy of an Oscar-winning
loving cup. This will be a tough

, nag to controliin April’s Academy

Award sweepstakes.

Second to "Sexy Rexy by about
two lengths is Trickie Dickie, a
Welsh-bred, ruggedly handsome
charger. Tric_k_ie Dickie is too’

_ Welsh at times and refuses to give

his all when he and Rexy ‘are
neck and neck. He

‘n-ickie overpowers Luscious
_ _ Liz in the stretch
Dlclue and just manages

to sneak by her‘for
place position. Liz ﬁnishes in, the
show spot and she is someshow
spot! She is the most beautiful
ﬁlly on the racing scene today, in
my opinion. Though carrying more

' weight than usual, she is in lovely

form. and a sight to behold. It is
when she neighs and snorts that
gets her fouled up in the race.‘
However, I must admit that
the “Cleopatra Handicap” is a
beautiful multi-colored event of
great magnitude‘ and scope.
‘Nothing has been spared by
track officials to keep the race
from becoming the biggest
grosser in turf history. I highly
recommend it to wagerers who
appreciate beauty, decor, lavish
spectacle and a wonderful,wire-
to-wire performance from Sexy
Rexy.

Now I direct your scratch sheets
to the latest workout by that
three-time ﬁlly of the year,
‘Dainty Dodo. Dodo is trying for
an unprecedented fourth crown as
the coveted Belle of the Box
office. For her latest jaunt, “The

I Thrill of it All Stakes,” the dar-

ling Dodo has switched trainers
and the switch proves to be
monetarily as well as ﬁnancially
Carl Reiner is her
new trainer and he is a superb
handler of ﬁlly maneuvers.

among the present crop of ﬁlly
performers. In “The ‘Thrill of it
ALL Stakes,” Dodo ‘
is a bundle of con-
ﬁdence, energy, ten-
derness, and espe-
cially noticeable in ‘
this race, independence. Running
without the aid of her stablemate,
the Rock of
proves she can goiit alone. She is
the frolicsome, ﬁlly-next-door
type to the nth degree wh_ile run-
ning against a tough ﬁeld of mares
from Madison Ave. Raceway. She
outwits the formidable ﬁeld by a
wide margin and her performance
is as bright, breezy /and brisk as
the race itself.
“The Thrill of it All Stakes”
is no handicap event. Equipping
.the slick field with the usual
stunning silks and bubbly back‘-
grounds, "track president Rose
Hunter has presented an eager
public with another sure-ﬁre
‘racing success. The -pattern of
this race is the same as past
ones: top horses, lovely silks,
and an entertaining course for
the ‘spirited sprinters to -trod
upon. Previously Mr. Hunter,
has presented The Pillow Talk,
The Lover Come Back and That
Touch of .Min‘k' Stakes with’
equal ﬁnancial and critical adu-,
lation. He is giving the chalkers
just what they want in the way
of easy-paced entertainment.
Dainty Dodo is Hunter’s« sure-
ﬁre ﬁlly and she has. responded
beautifully every time’ out; Her
purses are _greater than any ﬁlly
in turfdom, and that includes
Luscious Liz, her adventerous ad-
versary. Lis is a ﬁlly who is either
loved or despised by the betting
public. Publicity has helped and
hindered her in the race for ﬁlly
honors. Dodo. has never, had
harmful publicity from the Morn-
ing Telegraph and has remained
the favorite, unblemished‘ ﬁlly of
an adoring public.‘Every time she
runs the bettors flock to the rail.
Dainty Dodo, on the strength of
“The Thrill of it All” and other
past performances will be the
worthy recipient of Belle hon-
ors. And those honors surely
ain't hay! . / '

Last week, the University’s School of .Medicine voted
«.g...‘i-to. re-deﬁne its earlier statement against “engaging in or
‘ supporting university activities -of any nature, official or
"-semi-ofﬁcial, which_ are conducted in private town or
country clubs which use racial or religious criteria as a
.basis for membership.” ’

In the new statement, the terms

 

“official and semi-

':i" funds from the ‘University or organizations associated with
the University.” » i j '

 What this ammounts to is a virtual boycott of almost
all functions which are notaUniversity’wide, for most "of the
clubs which individual University organizations frequent

till now has been which clubs to boycott, not which to
attend.

The solution is to be found in the founding of a Univer-

 facilities for banquets, meetings, and whatever other func-
tions the individual University organizations should choose

The club would, being an official part of the University,
discriminate against no race, creed, or religion and would
 also" alleviate the need to’ use outside clubs for functions.

Such positive actions on the part of the University

would most certainly quiet the complaints of a “not strong

enough” policy on discrimination’ which have been leveled’

at this institution in the past, and might well serve as‘ a
model for like moves at other colleges throughout the
country which have been faced with the same problem.

Inter-Faith Marriage: Part 3' . ._. I"

Love Conquers All

 

At this point in the history of the Re-
public, society prefers to look upon the

question of inter-faith marriage as non-exis-
‘tailti but it isbecoming increasingly more
difficult to forget the statis- -
tics. _V _ , '
In 1950, the Bureau of-
the Census conducted a
survey as a part of its reg-’
ular business to .ﬁnd ‘the
percentage of mixed mar-V’
‘riages in" the country and
discovered that out of 54,-
000,000 It 0 t a 1 marriages,
nearly 18 ‘per cent of the
couples who responded still _ 9 4 _
considered themselves members of ’diﬁer-
ent faiths. " ’

This does not include persons. who have

converted to one faith or another upon.

marriage but strictly those whose marriage
had crossed ‘religious lines and remained
crossed. ' '

What this implies is that a, signiﬁcant _

percentage of Americans contemplating
marriage areimore concerned with lost as
a factor in marriage than religious or~cul-
tural backgrounds. I ‘

It is, of course, impossible. to ascertain
exactly what percentage of these marriages

have resulted in so-called “loss of faith,” for‘ 
a “rejection of cultural ties,” but it is quite ’

probable that it does not run very high.
Proven Fact ' ~ »

It is a proven factof human’ nature that»

a person fears somethingmuch more when
he can only speculate about its resultsthan
when he can ‘know positively. Thus, most
people fearing a Catholicor a Jew as an
inlavv are amazed to discover. after the
marriage that such a person. is not as great

 

By Matthew Swetonic

a danger to religion and background as he
had supposed.

The next logical step will‘ be to have
resolutions passed by the various faiths
which would cut much of the religious red

tape prohibiting such marriages. As a mat- _
ter of fact, even the strong prohibitive 2

Roman church began inquiries last fall in
the Ecumenical Council to discover whether
the present system could be a factor in
driving the faithful out of,..the churches.

Unfortunately, no decree by any faith
will go veryiifar towards convincing the
family of a person contemplating marriage
to one of another religion that such a
juncture will not destroy his religion, social
status, and cultural ties.

Love Breaks Bonds i - - '_ ' _‘
Thus, it appears that love may well have

to be the factor which will ultimately break
the bonds of restriction which prevent
many'“a marriage in this country. 

Love is essentially a selﬁsh emotion and

‘it is this very quality which makes it—_so
‘powerful. When ‘a man and a woman are
truly in love, their affection knows no re- ,‘

ligioniéxcept love itself, and as marriage is
the logical’ outcome of love, there can be
no other eventual resultbut complete dis-
regard of the restrictions against inter-faith

. _mar'riag‘e. .

People in love know no logic and are
thus" quite suited tovdeal with-the illogical
bans“-irnposed by religion _and culture. Only
when therevare social restrictions", affecting
the -free association by people-‘of marriag-
able age with those of another religion will
this practice continue. However, places of .
this sort, : i.e. many districts of the south,"
are rapidly beingfoirced to recognizethe

iequality oflnotionly all races but of all

religious as well. ‘

The Importance "of . .. .

 

      eiingf Rational     

 

Our culture values rationality. When an indi-
vidual commits an act ‘he is expected to be able
to explain why. Proabb lythe best indication" of
the value "our culture places on rationality is" the
fact that “demagogue”" (a dema- ' '
gogue by deﬁnition appeals to _ ,
the emotions) is a derogatory
word. , ’

The importance of emotions
of’ the irrational, however, is '
highlighted by the civil rights
movement. It is ‘axiomatic that
prejudice is an irrational belief.
But how about those people who
are ‘active in the movement?
Are they rationally motivated?
And what about the people who

sit on thefence or are opposed to integration and

do nothing, or sympathetic and do nothing?
Although overt segregation in the‘ south and

overt and subtle discrimination in the north are

a century old, events had to be dramatized and

. martyrs created to awaken America’sv conscience.

 

After waves of mass demonstrations in the south, I

Americans began to take interest.

Cruel Reality . _
Pictures in The New York Times ‘and other
papers across the country.of‘police dogs attacking

 marchers awakened us to_ the cruel -reality of

police brutality. ltesistanceto the integration of
the University of Mississippi and the University
of ‘Alabama focused our attention on the injus-
tice of segregated colleges. In 1963 segregation
became an issue of national concern. ‘
The list of longdramatic events have aroused
our indignation’. Only recently the ‘latest dramatic
event, the church bombing in Birmingham.‘ en-

tailed the death offour young Negroggirls. Ppresi-1 .

ham since World.War II. Yet what are 50 bomb-
ings? There is no way of knowing how many
Negroes have been maimed by segregation and
discrimination. These people do not make the
headlines. What. the system has done‘ to them
nevertheless, is just as outrageous as one isolated
and gross manifestation of that system such as the-
church bombing.

Few Events in North _

~ In the north there are few dramatic events.-
Last Tuesday ‘60 Pitt students attended-., a student
NAACP meeting. Last year at this time the stu-
dent group was ‘dormant. Yet the pattern of dis-
crimination in Pittsburgh has not detiorated.
Only because the dramatic events of the past year
have aroused our emotions has the civil rights
movement become as strong as it is in Pittsburgh.

The Washington March for-Jobs and Freedom
convinced me ‘of the emotional nature of com-
mitment.’ A friend of mine went to Washington
just to ﬁnd out what was happening and to have
a good time. Before the trip she was. more or less
sympathetic. On the way home she swore that.
the march had not effected her one bit. "Yet she
kept singing “We Shall Overcome.” She also de-
cided to join the NAACP and work for the Hill.
Education Project. She has since tried to explain
to her friends that “It’s not "enough just to be
sympathetic. You’vé got to do something.” up

That thin. line between being sympathetic -and

doingsomething can be_ bridged‘ only byveiiiotiona-1"

Sage Remarks
J armolenko
Quits Soccer

  

‘ By Bob Smizik it

_ Losing a regular player would bother most coaches but
according to soccer coach Leo Bemis “the general atmosphere
of the team has improved since George J armolenko quit the
.team.” , .

Jarmolenko, a highly thought of sophomore who started
at inside left for the booters, quit the team last week when,
as Bemis said, “He didn’t want to do what the rest of th
team wanted to do.

. “He wouldn’t do what we wanted in calesthenics,” Bemis
said. “The captain called him on it. and told him to do what
the rest of the team was doing or take off. He decided to take
off. . ‘ e '

“A teammate talked him 
into coming back the next  '

when he found out what he
had to do to get back on the
team he decided to drop off
the squad for good.”
The captains an4lBen1is
had asked Jarmolenko to
make up the ‘work he mis-
sed the day he walked off
the ﬁeld. This included
laps and sprints. Accord-
ing to Bemis, Jarmolenko
said “I can’t see doing
.this.” .
J armolenko has apparent-

 

he started here. ‘Bemis said, GEORGE JARMOLENKO
“We had trouble with George last year, but‘ we felt sure
he’s swing into line this year while working with the varsity.
He was a complete individualist last year, but we thought
he’s chance with the varsity. He never did.”

J armolenko was one of the few players on the team with
‘a soccer scholarship. “I can’t say that he will lose his scholar-
ship,” Bemis said, “but I certainly will recommend that "he
does. One of the stipulations of the scholarship is that he
play soccer.” "

Rees Also Hos- Problems » V -

While Bemis is having personnel trouble, cross country
coach Carl Rees is having team trouble. _

After getting off to what looked like a good season the
harriers were humiliated by Ohio University Saturday.

_One of the biggest problems facing Rees is the in-
ability of his runners to put two good seasons together.
Senior Bill Mocnik was Rees’.top. freshman in 1960 but
hasdone nothing as a varsity performer. 4 '

As a sophomore in 1961 Steve.Waslo led the team in vir-
tually every race. He was a major” disappointment last year
and has-done nothing this ‘season even though he'is over
teeth trouble which allegedly, caused his downfall last year.

This year seems to. be Larry Robinson’s turn to flop.
Robinson took over for Waslo last year as the team’s number
one man. This season he has yet to score a pointfor the team
in two meets.

Here’s hoping that the jinx is not catching up with

sophomore Dave Eichelaub. Eichenlaub gave promise of be-
coming a top-ﬂight runner last year, but has been slowed
by injuries this season and has not lived up to expectations.
Eichenlaub, however, is an extremely hard worker and
chances are he won't be a second year ﬂop like many of his
teammates. ’ .

All but overlooked in the Panthers win over Washington
was the clutch play by end Gene Sobolewski. After the Pan-
ther’s second touchdown W,ashington’s Steve,Bramwe1l ap-
parently was set to go all the way with the kickoff when
Sobolewski brought him down from behind, after Bramwell
had outrun Bill _Bodle, who looked like Pitt’s last hope. .

If Sobolewski hadn’t caught up with the Washington
speedster, the Huskies would have been in a" position to tie
up the game or even go ahead.
