By IRV JACOBS /
One of education’s strongest ad-
vocates of “the satisfaction of un-
derstanding” is Dr. Max A. Lauf-
fer, head of Pitt’s budding depart-
ment of Biophysics. Pitt, one of a
handful. of leading universities
-that include a department of bio-
physics, can attribute its early lead
in this new ﬁeld to the initiative of

Dr.'Lauifer, pioneering professor

of Physics.

The tall,
oneer, who founded the depart-

ment in 1948, came to Pitt in 1944
after serving as associate profes-
sor at the Rockefeller Institute for

Medical Research. Since its estab-

lishment, the department, under

Dr. Lau1Ter’s guidance, has grown

from a small division catering only

to graduate students to a complete

undergraduate and graduate school

program, today granting B.S., M.S.,
and Ph.D. degrees. ’
_r The undergraduate program, re-
cently established, may be of spe-
cial interest to the science majors
he/re. R_equirements for a B.S. de-
gree in biophysics include two
years each -of biology, physics,
chemistry, and mathematics. Stu-
dents interested in the new -ield
are encouraged to discuss the
possibilities with Dr. -Lauﬁer,
whose office is in 307 Thaw Hall.
' Virus’ Studied
The new department head, al-
ready a leader in original research
in- this country, has, todate, com-
pleted notable work in the study
of virus’ structure and the rela-
tionship to pathogeneity, ability to
cause disease. Such nemeses of

A surprise reception and dinner
at Duquesne University was held

for Dr. Manuel C..E1mer by pro-
fessional

colleagues Saturday,
April 28. Dr. Elmer, head of ,Pitt’s
sociology department, will retire

in June after 30 years of service

to the University. ,
Earlier that same day Dr.
Elmer was honored by Alpha
,Kappa Delta. the local chapter
of the sociological fraternity,
~’l‘he newly established M. C.
‘Elmer Award will_,bc given
annually to the individual
‘with the "best research paper.
Having come to Pitt in 1926, Dr.
Elmer established the sociology

He was also the founder of the

now the School of Social Work.

.* .\

SALK A]])—Dr: Max A. Lautfer adjusts mechanism of one of

Department. Since coming to

Some of his ﬁndings aided Dr.

certain bacterial viruses, have

come under the scrutinous eye of
Dr. Lauffer with his team.

Asked if any of his research
duplicated that of the health de-
partments, Dr. Lauffer explain-
ed that the two differ in that
one is concerned with funda-
mental research and-the other
is applied research. The‘ policy
of his department, he stated
proudly, is one of pure scientiﬁc
motivation—-—to ﬁnd out the hows

and whys of biophysical phe-
nomena.

In that statement lies a basic
philosophy that perhaps ‘all Pitt
students might note. “One of the
greatest joys in the satisfaction of
life,” he remarked,,“is the joy that
comes from understanding.” His
research is not primarily directed
toward the solving of practical
problems, but, rather, emphasis
on .lust for basic knowledge.

_Any practical results that grow
out or his work are accepted as a

bonus satisfaction. Biophysical
background information, for ex-
ample, was important in the de-
velopment of the Salk vaccine.

Despite all his scientiﬁc ‘nature,
Dr. Lauffer strangely deviates,
from’ such interests at home. His
hobby, he admitted, is that of col-
lecting railroad timetables. “Had
to take that up,” he explained.
“The wife wouldn’t [put up with
my old hobby--a virus collection.”

entitled “A Sense of Poetry,” by
quoting several English poets on
their deﬁnitions of a “poet.” Ac-
cording to Philip Bailey, “Poets
are all who love and all who feel
great truths and tell them, and
the greatest truth is love.” Shakes-
peare said that a poet gives to airy
things “a shape and .a name.”
Answering the question
“Where is poetry?”, the speaker
said that it is not enough to’sa-y
that poetry is everywhere. We
should try to be more speciﬁc.
“We can ﬁnd poetry in different
levels of everyday life.
“Thomas Moore, the Irish poet
gives ‘an example of poetry on a
simpler level in a poem on French
cooking, written in 1818. Emily

..Dickenson’s poems are further ex-

amples of this kind of poetry.”

Internal Happiness Important

Lady D’Arcy contended that
without‘ internal happiness‘ “one
can do nothing -constructive, ‘but
seldom do writers portray happi-
ness. There is nothing a human
being can not do if he really wants
to do it.

“He has inﬁnite, immeasurable
potentialities. If a person feels
that life has not given him much,
he should ask himself how much
he has given life.”

 . i  Proper Judgment

The formation of a Judiciary committee for Interfra-
ternity Council shows considerable -progress toward the

', realization of the true ‘meaning of self-government at this

University. , ~

_The fact that a student committee must ﬁrst recognize-
discipline or administrative difficulty in all fraternities and «
attempt to solve it before it is presented before the faculty
committeegives all men a greater responsibility——to deter-’
mine the source of trouble, to present the situation before
fraternitypeers, to reach a solution to the problem whichis
‘honorable’ and forceful. '_ ‘ ,

_ Because cases will be tried “involving fraternities or
fraternity members for violation of IF rulings,”.’IF’council
must take care: that those decisions it passes are suitable to
all its groups; that they_ are sensible enough from the begin-
ning to merit judicial hearings in the event of violations.

It is signiﬁcant that the program has been supported all
-the way by Fraternities advisor Richard Cunningham and
senior awardee Don Gartner, who was chairman. Gartner’s
sensible leadership and clear thinking have been vital to the-
committee. ‘ V ’ ‘ ,

Cunningham has provided the force. At two recent IF
meetings he provided the “Do something or else” attitude
that he has the right to enforce, saying; in effect, if IF
‘didn’t attempt to control itself more closely, he would take
it upon himself to‘ do so. ‘ '

Being the advisor he is, Cunningham knewythe men
would rise to the challenge. And they did. With everyone
aware of the need for the commission, it should be successful.

 liram Pits to Pulpit _ A

Exclusive of studies, Spring Carnival is probably the
largest single. project in which all students take part through-

~ out the year. ,And this year, the Carnival committee, mindful

_of the impact of education on its participants, has chosen to
immortalize Shakespeareiin the annual spring festival. This
is to be expected. ' A

Shakespeare was a great one for buffoonery; He also.
knew personalities and skilfully transformed them into.

' stage characters who fascinated his public .from the pit to the
.'‘pulpit. Carnival will all"too well show that Pitt students are‘

characters, to.o.. v V - _
Whatever the impact Carnival may have educationally

‘ or commercially, andf/neither is usually verypositive, we’ll
have to say “It’s going to be fun.” V‘

Changing Tens of Millions . : .

No Strings Attached

By Irv Rot-hmon

The Indian people would prefer to receive aid
from the United States with “no strings‘ attached”
Indian Ambassador Gaganirhair Mehta told Men’s
Debate Association members on WQED “Campus
on Call” Wednesday night. V

In this brief butpoignant statement, the Am-
bassador brought out facts that have been obvious
for some time and have reﬂected er" ‘  '
the nil foreign ‘policy of the State
Department under John Foster
Dulles. .

While this government should .
be conducting a positive program
it has attempted to force Asian
countries into following United
States policy on the basis of for-
eign aid; it has expressed disap-
pointment with those countries
that are “swinging left” because of consistent trade
with Communist China and Russia; it has attempted
to control through colonial trade relationship a
“new” Asia which is going through economic, ‘so-
cial, and industrial development that other countries
went through ﬁfty years ago. .

While the United States grew great because of

    

ioriginal small population and unlimited resources,

the Ambassador pointed out, India must change
the way of lifefor tens of millions in a relatively
short time with, however, no frontiers" to beat
down. The government will turn to those coun-
tries that provide the» best possible trade relations
amti enable the industrial expansion to be carried
on . ’

 

The fact that India trades with Russia is no
more an indication that it favors the Cominform
than that its receiving aid from this government
means it follows the “American" line. Obviously,
it does not. ’ 1

India is looking to its own expansion through
a realistic foreign trade policy that gives it the
freedom to develop independent foreign policy

apart from British and American interests still en- J

trenched in that country.

Futile Desire , _

Mr. Dulles’ desire to “win” Asia is a futile
one for, in following a general policy, he has ne-
glected the individualism of every state—India, its
neutrality; Pakistan, its Moslem control;
Vietnam, its ' French inﬂuence; the Philippines,»
staunch individualism and strong United States sup- .
port readily accepted. - 

All of these countries are similar in that they
are reaching for equality, independence. “India
prides itself on resembling the original 13 colonies
for the independence and vigor it seeks.

.But the Indian government wants to do it‘ by
itself. It will carry ‘on trade with Red China or

Russia if those countries provide the supplies they -
need cheaper than the United States. They no long.-,.

er want charity, but loans.

Industrialization is changing the whole. picture
in Asia, the proud Ambassador stated, in effect.
As far as this reporter is concerned, D_ulles should ‘
reverse some of his own industry for shaping for-
eign policy to ﬁt the “new” Asia rather" than to
continue a‘ failing crusade to “win” India from
Russia. I

Administration Support

Even the Pitt administration
supported the Association’s po-
sition. Acting Chancellor Dr.
Charles B. Nutting stated that,
“ .' . . As for the AAUP’s prin-
ciples, Pitt’s administration has
always supported them and will
continue 'to do so.”

This action of the AAUP and
of they Pitt professors who at-
tended the meeting makes one
of the most recent perform-
ances of our late Student Con-
gress look rather -sick.

A few months ago, Senior Joe
Banik proposed at a Student
Congress .meeting that SC take
some stand on action taken-by
the student body at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin. Wisconsin
had ﬁled a brief to the United
States Supreme Court support-
ing a position of the Labor
Youth League, a left-wing stu-
dent organization, which was
appealing an order that it re-
gister as a Communist Front or-
ganization.

Support or Condemnation

The idea of taking action on -

 

the Wisconsin brief, either sup-.-"

porting or condemning it, was»-

neatly ‘put to death by Student
Congress president Bob Sedler
& Co. It seems that Congress
felt it had far more important

things to do than to take a stand . '

concerning academic freedom. 

So long as our student gov-._ 4

ernment refuses to touch any-
thing controversial than .the
prices in the Tuck Shop, or the
parking problem, it will remain
a meaningless organization. A
The actionitaken by the Pitt
professors at the last meeting
of the AAUP shows that the

professors recognize the truth in ’

Tom Paine’s warning that,
“He that would make his own

liberty secure must guard even 1

his enemy from oppression; ‘for

if he violates his duty, he es-W»
tablishes a precedent that will‘_

Another change was‘ enacted
in the section dealing with pen-
alties which can be imposed on
the violating fraternity or fra-

ties, inaddition to ﬁning and

Tomorrow afternoon

baseball team will take on
what is proving to be the best
baseball team, college wise, in
the aiea. The Panthers will meet
the Iron Dukes from Duquesne
on Moore Field at 3:15 p.m.

In an attempt to spill the Dukes
from their perch atop the college
baseball standings, the Panthers

In retaliaton, Duquesne is_ put-

Binder, the Dukes will have Dave

chores. Ricketts, who is the lead-

one of their better pitchers when
he is not appearing behind the
plate.

17 out of 18 ball games, enter the
game on the crest of a six-game

to be the guests of Duquesne should they getoby the Prexies.

With eight more .matches

carded for the present cam-

paign, the Panthers will be hard pressed to keep their record

unblemished.‘ After their engagement

to boom the way it did last year.
If the bats of Dunlap, Jaxel, and
Schmitt all started producing base
hits in the game it will be a long
afternoon for the Duke twirlers.
Gordon Comes Alive .

Lewis has stated that his third
baseman, Joe Gordon, has been
hitting nothing but line drives,
but they have been going into the
hands of the opposition. He feels

that sooner or later these have to '

start going for base hits and this
might be the game for it.

Adding to the woes that Moog I

must face are third baseman Sam
Talenti and ﬁrst sacker George
Sertick. The shortstop position for
the Dukes will go to Harry Weih-
rauch. ,-

Following is the probable start-
ing lineup for the game:

THE TRUE. ilND TYPICAL CASE or
CHATSWORTH OSCEOLA

The school year draws to an end, and everybody is
wondering about the future - everybody, that is, except the
engineers. Today there is not a single engineer on a single
campus who has not received a dozen fabulous offers from
a dozen corporations.

All this, of course, you know. But do you know just how
fabulous these\ofl’ers are? Do you have any idea how wildly
the corporations are competing? Let me cite for ‘you the true
and typical case of Chatsworth Osceola, a true and typical
senior. —

and members of the audience.
But no one was more surpris-

opened the second page of The

“Mr; and Mrs. Pitt Named.”
Nicola Sirianni, Mr. Pitt, was
also surprised to learn the

Body Becomes Hyperactive
Therefore, by injecting‘ the body
with a very potent dose of vac-
cine, the body can ‘become’ ”hyper-
active” in the production of anti-
bodies. In this way, the body can
begin to ﬁght off an attack of
polio almost at once while gen-
erating more anti-virus material
within only a short time after
initial contact with the disease.

ural immunity by protecting in-
