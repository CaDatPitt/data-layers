Hagan, Former Quarterback, Speaks For Grid Team;
Rose Nugent Kicks Football At Ceremony
In Grotto At ‘Kick-Off’ Informal

Approximately 500 couples swing into the Grotto ballroom
tonight to celebrate the opening of two 1936 seasons—football
and social, at the Kick-Off Informal, annual College Association
dance. —

Dancing to the tunes of Bob Fredette and his Philco Radio
Orchestra begins at 9 o’clock, and during the subsequent four
hours several events will take place which should make this 11th
annual frolic one of the most gala“

events in University history.

At approximately 11 o’clock, CA
time, Coach Charles Rogers, '37,
leads an All-beauty eleven to the
Grotto stage for a kick off ceremony
that will end with the booting of an
autographed Pitt football into the
crowd of fraternity men, non-frater-
nity men, engineers, d-ents, young
Sliysters, and even Deans.

Heape, Orr
Win Laurels

In Speed Boat

Professional Boat Racers
Relate Narrow Escape,
Movie Experiences

By William Colker

Traveling as far north as Boston,
as far south as Maryland and as far
west as Cleveland, Robert W. Heape,
C39, and Lawrence E. Orr, C39, won
new laurels in outboard motor racing
this summer.

Heape, the only person to win the
Pennsylvania S t a t e Professional
Championship, having won it in 1934
and again this year, and Orr, as his
mechanic, carried their boat with
them on a trailer a distance of 23,000
miles, to win 11 out of 15 races.

Heape and Orr are the holders of

_ Jmany racing titles, having won the

Adirondack Professional Champion-
ship, the Finger Lake Class C Cham-
pionship and the Otisco Lake Profes-
sional Championship.

Appeared In Movies

Outboard racing, it seems, has that
danger, that uncertainty of what
might happen, to make it interesting.
Heape was racing at Trenton when
the gas line broke, and ﬁre spurted
from the exhaust, causing the boat
to look like a comet whizzing across
the water. The gas line is located
above the exhaust, and if he had
stopped the ﬁre would have caught
up to the break in the gas line and
exploded the gas in the tank. He
had to keep running after the race
was over to exhaust his supply of gas.

Heape recalls another close call
with death that he had last year at
Rochester. The boat tipped over
twice, plunging him into the swirling,
churning Water. Seven boatspassed
over the spot where he went down
before he came to the surface. He
‘still recalls the whining noise of the
motors as they passed over him.

Heape and Orr have made a short
for RKO on outboard racing, soon to
be released. The feature includes
everything from how to rig up a mo-
tor to what the well-dressed daredevil
driver will wear. ’

thus get much better service from
the photographer.

Goldstein also stresses the fact that
all the pictures must be taken by

First Year Men Take Tests
In Orientation Classes
Tuesday, Thursday

According to the plans of Paul
Bearer, E37, and Paul Jennings, C37,
co-chairmen of the Men's customs pro-
gram, customs examinations for all
freshman men will be given on Tues-
day and Thursday of next week.

All freshmen will be examined in

1 their regular orientation classes, ex-

cept freshmen in the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines. The latter
groups will be examined during their
regular psychology class at the fourth
hour on Tuesday. Examinations will
be given and corrected exclusively by
upperclass counselors.

The green buttons, which freshman
men are wearing at the present time,
will be replaced by bronze panther
pins with the numerals 40 mounted
in blue.

Ten Per Cent Get Plaques

Freshman plaques will be awarded
at Memorial Hall on Friday, Novem-
ber 20, to approximately ten per cent
of the class of 1940. Plaques will be
distributed on a basis of results of
the examinations, participation in ac-
tivities, recommendations of counsel-
ors and faculty instructors. Further
qualiﬁcations are a “C” average with

no “F’s” in academic work.

The examinations will be based on
knowledge of the history of the Uni-
versity, on the names and positions
of the deans and administrative offi-
cers, outstanding student leaders,
campus buildings, cheers and songs.

Pitt  Age

F‘A’s first s"treamer" headline, excluding electipnsyis the ﬁrst in

many moons for the official student governing group at this
University. It, therefore, chalks up quite an achievement on the
asset side of the balance sheet.

The gesture has been made. For some years now, many stu-
dents have growled a bit now and then about the iinactivity of
their student government. This, innjiost cases, was done by people
who had nothing constructive to offer, but merely wished to tear
down something which was not fL‘in“ct‘ioning at ‘top speed.

However,’like many other organizations of this kind, the group
passed through periods of change du_ri__ng the last few years. Each
one, we believe, had some members who were interested in proj-
ects other than securing dance chairmanships for their respective
followers. Those few are the ones you seldom read of, yet when
something important breaks you__v_vill ﬁnd them mixed in the very
center of activity. _

As evidenced by today’s streamer. or banner headline on the
front page, a big thing has happened. Those responsible for the
project are not so import-ant at this moment. More important are
those who will sign to ﬁll positions in that cheering block. SFA
needs 800 students to make the plan a success. After students sub-
scribe to that amount the case rests in the hands of SFA. But, to-
day they need help!

Pitt’s football teams are known from coast to coast. They
are known, year in and year out, to have few equals. In the past
three years, Pitt bands have marched out on the ﬁeld to win simi-
lar acclaims.

The Paciﬁc Coast invented the card shuffling tricks, and has
held supremacy in this department since that time. Pitt, quite
naturally, at this time takes the initiative for the East. What Pitt
does in this department depends on the student support and en-
dorsement of the project. The blue and gold coat jackets are
free, and you can even sit with your favorite Coed‘ or Ed. Let s
get behind this, and put it over with a bang that will be heard as

far west as Trojanland.

No Parking!

PARKING on Alumni drive has become quite a problem. Most
everyone recognizes that two minutes often means the differ-
ence between arriving at Prof. Hunts English class. on time or
“late.” Now everyone knows that Mr.. Hunt 1S ordinarily a very
charming person. But Mr. Hunt does not like you to'rep'ort late
for his class. So you park on the wrong side of Alumni drive, and
14 auto accidents are narrowly averted during your very pleasant
stay in “217” only by the expert maneuvers of the “other fellow.

Accidents do happen, they have happened, and.wi1l continue
to happen unless the boys remember that, although it is very nice
to have a charming Mr. Hunt, it is alarming to be prosecuted for
negligence in parking caused by ignoring the parking rules.‘

If the practice does not stop, we are told, tickets will be
awarded to the offenders. This, however, will be the last resort.
The solution is ﬁrst, to start two minutes earlier next time, and
second, if all available spaces are ﬁlled, move on up the hill where

parking is permitted.

EN the class of 1917 was at college, a long

more than ten minutes to be put through.

This time has been whittled down gradually, so

that now the connection

is made in an average of

1.4 minutes—n.ine out of ten of them while you

hold the line.

But this is only one phase of the relentless effort
to improve. Your service is better today because

By The Campus Scout
Down among the West Virginia foothills, in Morgantown.
there’s a pesky band of Mountaineers. Just about this time today
they’re apacking up, aputting on thar besties, agrabbing up thar
shootin’ irons, and goin’ on a Visit. According to J esamiah Hmgby,

the owner of that noisy little still just across from Smiggins’ corn-
ﬁeld, they’re agonna attempt to settle a little feud that has been
going on for nigh on to 35 years.

That little band of Mountaineers isv

Coach Charles Tallman’s football

squad, which will try to make things
hum up the Pittsburgh way tomorrow
when they stride out against Jock
Sutherland’s Panthers in the renewal
of the grid rivalry between the Pitt
and West Virginia teams, scheduled
on the Stadium turf tomorrow after-
noon at 2 o’clock.

Coming into the Panther game with
one of the nation's best aerial com-
binations, an undefeated team with
two games under their belt, and a
strong will to whip the Panthers, the
West Virginians have reached the
high point in their 1936 schedule, the
annual Pitt game.

Coach Tallman has built up quite a
dangerous little team down there
among all the stills. In its opener
this season Tallman saw his boys take
a stubborn, ﬁghting Waynesburg
eleven, 7-0. A week later, last Fri-
day, the Gold and Blue gave a re-
markable come back exhibition when
they crushed Ohio University, 40-6.

Moan, Barna Dangerous

Headlining the West Virginia at-
tack will be an already famous pair,
a pair that scored three touchdowns
last week, the Kelly Moan to Babe
Barna air-route. Both Moan and
Barna return from last season’s
Mountaineer team and are even more
dangerous this season than last in
their aerial show.

Only one other player that started
against the Panthers last year, di-
minutive Glenn Carder at left half-
back, will start in the game tomor-
row. The remainder of the varsity
contains four sophomores and four
reserves that have earned starting po-
sitions this season. .

Up on the Panther practice ﬁeld,
Coach Jock Sutherland has switched
the Pitt lineup around in four differ-
ent positions. In place of George De-

lich will be Ave Daniell, the senior‘

right tackle, who has been pushing
Delich hard for the past two weeks
for the start. Arnold Greene will re-
place Johnny Michelosen at quarter,
Henry Adams will take over Don
Hensley’s_position at‘ center, and the
ﬁnal change ﬁnds Frank Patrick start-
ing in Bill Stapulis’ post at fullback.

Pitt will lineup the same as it did
in the Ohio Wesleyan game last Sat-

urday at all the other positions. Bill
Daddio and Frank Souchak will give
Moan trouble from the end jobs. Mar-
shall Goldberg, who made a great
start in his debut as a Panther regu-
la1' last week, and veteran Bobby La-
Rue will be at the halves.

Tony Matisi, 210~pounder, will be
at the other tackle post with Daniell,
and Biﬁ’ Glassford will share the
guard positions with Dante Dalle
Tezze. This will be the probable
starting eleven men, with Sutherland
planning to use his second stringers a
great deal as he did in the Ohio Wes-
le_van game.

Two Tons of Beef!

In weight, the two teams will enter
the game almost on par with each
other. The Mountaineers, with most
of the shootin’ irons in the hands of
Mr. Moan, will shoot 2034 pounds of
football beef at the Panthers’ con-
trasting 2095 pounds. When one ton
of solid meat hits another ton of good
football ﬂesh, if feathers won’t fly,
something will.

The game tomorrow will be the
29th in the 35 years of football feuds
between the Mountaineers and the
Panthers. Of the 29 games, the Pitt
teams hold the edge with 23 victories.
Two games went into the books as
ties while West Virginia was very
happy on only three occasions.

lt’s been a long time since the
Mountain boys have really had their
shootin’ irons awork-ing right. The
last Mountaineer win over the Golden
Panthers happened back in ’28, a sur-
prise 9-6 victory for the West Vir-
ginians.

Engineers To Confer

A group of engineering students
will meet in the YMCA Conference
R-oom, Room 801, Cathedral, Mon-
day at 12:40 o’clock.

Those asked to attend are Ray
Nordstrom, ’38; Howard Dyche, ’38;

WARNING you in the picture is the Panther team's very reliable right

end, Frank Souchak. “Chow,” as the boys call him, is quite adept at
blocking, pass catching, and especially is he quite adept at putting that
ball through the goal posts after his mates have pounded out another touch-
down. '

Mr. Souchak will be one of many Panthers who will try to rush in at

So that versatile novices will not

novice basketball tournament, origi-

following week, beginning Monday,
October 19.

This announcement came from the
basketball sponsor, Dr. H. Clifford
Carlson, after he had huddled in the
corner of the new athletic offices with
Carl Olson. Mr. Olson had selected a
few dates in the same week, namely
October 14 and 15, for his novice
track and ﬁeld meet.

Rain, at its best or worst, has

Pairings, however, are listed on the
bulletin board outside Alumni Hall.
The two Bobs, Madden and Bald,
draw byes through the ﬁrst round, as
does Irwin Solow, last year varsity
teamster. Matches in the ﬁrst round:
Lewis opposing Willson; Kennedy
against Wilson; Bill McKenna and
Calloman shaking racquets at each
other, and number two man of last
year's frosh team, Hartman, matching
his skill against Sigmon.

Rosenﬁel-d is carded to meet Conti,
and Hergenroder opposes Suici.

Last season frosh netmen, Culp and
Mogan, are paired off. Levinson and

Kunkel and Henry. Kristufek plays

basketball proclivities, may have the
chance to get into the two events.

Both tournaments have one thing
in common. That is that they’re open
to anyone except the experts. Varsity
and freshman letter winners or even
numeral winners are advised n-ot to
ﬁll out entry blanks. They are
ineligible.

Both coaches have the same pur-
poses. First, there’s the fun from
playing. And, second, native talents
might be brought out. The batches
of entries that both Olson and Carl-
son have piled on their desks are
steeped to about the same height.
And that’s plenty high.

With the all-University track and
meet only about a week and
a half away, entry blanks should be
signed at once. The entry blank ap-

_ Track novices may easily engage
in practice sessions. The Stadium

‘track is open all day and track man-

agers will immediately issue equip-
ment.

Sixteen events, covering all of the
track and ﬁeld events are listed. In-
cluded among these are foot races,
jumping events, and weight events.

Dr. Whitney Reports

Denmark’s Folk High Schools Operate As Cooperatives
As Do Nearly All Business Organizations; System
Not Form Of Socialism——Type Of Capitalism

By WILLIAM MURRAY
Dr.,G. D. Whitney, of the School of Education, who visited
Denmark this summer, found that A. Ritsmar Pedersen Was right.

Interviewed by The Pitt News

last year when he came to the _

University from Denmark to study our methods of education,
Mr. Pedersen stated that there were 3,500,000 people in his native

country and about
ing to Dr. Whitney.

lncluding the time he spent travel-
ing back and forth, Dr. Whitney was
away seven weeks. Half of his shore
time was spent in Denmark, the rest
in Sweden and England. V V

In Denmark he found that the
Danish folk high schools are operated
on a cooperative system, no one per-
son being the responsible head. Most
of the schools are out in the country;
so 1. board of farmers governs the
school policy. These folk high
schools emphasize the principle of
cooperation so that the students will
enter into the system dominant in
the nation.

Business Chiefly Cooperative

.NearlV every business is coopera-

tive, whether for the beneﬁt of con-
sumers or producers. A band of farm-
ers may organize to purchase any-
thing from fertilizer to large farm
machinery. Each farmer beneﬁts
from the organization and is equally
responsible with his neighbors. Si1ni—
lai‘l'y the same "men may form a pro-
ducers’ cooperative system to sell
dairy; products or pork; These latter
two are exported, mainly to England.

i"‘Such 5 system,” Dr. W'hitney ex-
plains, “ is not socialism, but a form
of capitalis..1. Marquis W. Child_s has
written a chapter on this economic
orgaiiization in his ‘Swede;;——The
Middle Way.’ The system is much the
same in Sweden as in Denmark.”

Stockholm, the capital of Sweden,
is known as “the Venice of the
North.” Here canals serve as addi-
tional streets, but there are more
automobiles than in Denmark. Never-
theless, the people are quite satisfied
to use their motor boats. Summer
places are popular on the nearby
Archipelago, and it is estimated that
12,000 motor boats travel back and
forth. '

Tenants Own Apartment

In Sweden, as in Denmark, the
cooperative system is used, big busi-
ness enterprises, as well_ as farmers’
groups, being founded on this prin-
ciple. One‘ of the two largest depart-
ment stores in Stockholm is coopera-
tive, as is an enormous ﬂour mill, and
an electric bulb manufacturing plant.
Apartment h-ouses are operated on
the same idea, each tenant owning
that section of the building in which
he lives.

Education is very far advanced in
Sweden, where the present school
system is said to be the best in the
world. It-, too, is operated in the
spirit of cooperation. Broadcasting is
regarded as an edu-cati-onal enterprise.

When he visited England, Dr.
Whitney says, he found no fog in
London. He did not see the Prince of
Wales, or rather the King, but he did
see a lot of traffic on the wrong
side of the street. One item of traf-
ﬁc he did not see W-as a huge omnibus
which almost ran him down.

Dr. Whitney points out that “teach-
ers are getting along well in London
since their salaries, which had been
cut, have been -restored to the origi-
nal amount. All in all, the English
educational system is well-developed,
including technical instruction.”

lChairman McQuade Selects
: Members Of Committee

Spreading propaganda among en-
gineering freshmen in the first issue
of the Nitt’ Pews, which put in its ap-
pearance yesterday on campus, the
Engineering Association swings into
action for its premier social event,

the Engineers Annual Fall Dance,
scheduled for October 23.
William McQuade, E37, recently

selected as chairman of the affair,
has chosen James Shields, E37; Rob-
ert Duncan, E37, and Richard Irwin,
E38, as his assistants.

Begun several years ago with a low
“dollar per couple” policy, the EA
affair has grown until in recent years
the purchase of a_ dance ticket also
entitles the holder to attend the EA
smoker held later in the semester.

The Engineering Association spon-
sors two social events each semester:
namely, the dance and the smoker.
Membership in the association is open
to those attending the dance.

The Nitt Pews, which is issued
some time_before each of the events,
began three years ago as a satirical
takeoff on the News.

will quite naturally sail somewhere
