Outcast, But Not Humbled Sports Writer Seeks Vainly
For Those Five Missing Touchdowns

 

By The Campus Scout

Little children cross the street when I approach. Mothers scare
their children by mentioning my name. I am an outcast. I am a
fugitive. I am the Campus Scout. (Brace up, my boy, and tell papa
what happened.)

I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong. I only thought I
knew what I was talking about. VVhy should I be branded an out-

cast simply because I picked Pitt to win over Duquesne by six touch-
downs? I'm still trying to ﬁgure what happened to the other ﬁve. Maybe
I can’t count past one, and perhaps the best thing to do is to forget all
about my past. (At least I picked Gustav L. Schramm to win the Ju-
venile court election.) That’s some consolation!

The Duquesne rooters in the Perrysville avenue district can hardly get
over the fact that they were defeated. Inasmuch as all were willing to
wager (i. e.—bet) on the game (if you gave them 25 points and 2 to 1 odds),
they seem to regard the outcome as a, moral victory, the Panther’s triumph
is worthless as far as they are concerned. After all boys, you can’t buy
sandwiches with moral wins.

I dread the thought of facing the razz-hungry printers at the WNU
plant. They laughed when I said six touchdowns, and I fear that the plant
is in ruins from the hysteria that undoubtedly developed after the game.
I guess that I should try to laugh the whole thing off, but I refuse to. In-
stead, I’ll take a few facts, sidelights, and ﬁgures to prove that the game
was plenty one-sided.

Pitt easily outgained the Dukes, 228 to 82 yards. The Pitt tackling
was cleaner and harder, and the ball carrying of the Panther backs dini-
med the feeble glow cast by the much-publicized Duke backs. The officials
were all right as officials go, and as most oflicials go, they certainly went.
I often wondered what would happen on a football ﬁeld if the oﬁicials didn’t
seem to do their job, and believe me, I found out on Saturday afternoon.
No, I’m not punch-drunk when I make such a statement, and I must admit
that I wasn’t on the ﬁeld, but one can follow the play very closely with a
pair of good glasses. To return to the offensive abilities of the two teams,
cast an eye on Bob Badger’s statistics on the sport page. They prove my
point, and save me work.

The Pitt line, considering the weather and the ﬁeld’s condition, per-
formed as well as I expected. Their play was, at all times, that of a smooth
machine. The Pitt tackles, playing the entire sixty minutes, easily out-
charged several squadrons of Duquesne tackles. The playing of Muggsy
Skladany throughout the game was a pretty sight, as was the performance
given by Rocker, Timmons, Shotwell, Kliskey, and the rest of the line. The
yardage piled up by Izzy Weinstock and Howdy O’De11 was enough to make
any statistician itch for an electric calculator. In short, the Pitt team
dominated the play throughout. Naturally enough, we must not forget the
kicking of Hogan and Munjas. Using a wet ball, the Panther kickers easily
outkicked the Duke punter, yet we can hardly overlook the fact that
Zaninelli did kick the Dukes out of plenty of tough spots. That’s that for
this_year’s game. ; ‘ .

Self Defense‘ ~

In order to protect my, ahem, good name, and to remove all fears that
I am deliberately turning pro,‘ I rise to state that the article appearing in
the Varsity News, sold at the Duke game, and bearing the Campus Scout
by-line was NOT written by the Scout. In fact, I want it emphatically
known! I haven't any idea who wrote the article yet, but I imagine that
something can be done about a retraction, an explanation, or an apology. So
what?

Philological Group Hears
Li t e r a t u re Discussion

 

Dr. M,arvin T. Herrick, associate
professor of English, and Evan T.
Sage, head of the classics department,
spoke at the Philological society meet-
ing Saturday evening at the Faculty
club.

Dr. Herrick’s subject was, “Require-
ments for the English Major.” He
pointed out that the growth of the
“honors” system in eastern colleges
had revived agitation for change in
requirements for the English major,
and told what an undergraduate
should know about English by the
time he has a bachelor of arts de-
gree. George Carver, professor of
English, led the discussion,

Dr. Sage spoke on “Euclid, and True
Literature.” He stated that our deﬁ-
nitions of the word, “literature,” are
too comprehensive and therefore mis-
leading. Its best, if not its only, true
representative is the Greek mathe-
matician, Euclid. Hugh A. Wing, in-
structor in English, led the discussion.

tors didn’t see during the game thatl
the players couldn’t miss.

reel; Sally Sanderson will dash-off
school social notes; and Lucius R.
Hassenplug will continue as the

‘King’ Swartz Gives Royal Portrayal
In Pitt Players’ First Production

Fine Cast, Good Acting,

Direction Make “Queen’s

Husband” Succeed, Pitt News Writer Finds

By E. Pickering

Suggested billing for Pitt Players’ coming production, “Carl

Swartz in “The Queen’s Husband.”
Sunday night at the preview before a

a delight to the audience.

Carl ’s presence on the stage is

goodly audience at the Irene Kaufmann Settlement he was the out-
standing actor of a large and good cast.
The plot of the Robert Sherwood play is nothing exceptional; a

kingdom ruled by a general with a ﬁgure head king and a bossy
queen; a princess, in love with a secretary, to be married off to a “silly
awss” of a prince for diplomatic reasons; a traditional revolution both of

the underclass and of the “forgotten-man” king;
But the dialogue is brilliant, with dripping satire and

please the audience.

and a happy ending to

sprightly comedy. The checker game between the king and the footnian is

rich.

First meet Lou Reizenstein, as ﬁne a little checker playing footman as

ever trod a stage. Then Joe Samson,

nicely handling a not-too-good part as

the king’s secretary and princess’ lover, and Betty Black, every inch a prin-

cess, and extremely attractive in a bridal gown.

Our opinion of queens has

changed a bit, thanks to the vitriolic qualities indicted into the part by

Betty Quarrie.

The king knew what he was talking about when, upon her

leaving for America, he said, “God help the President of the United States!”

The small part of the be-monocled and effiminate prince is neatly han-
dled by Joe Letteriello, his help in the part aids the cause of the princess

in the hearts of the audience.

As for the others; Herb Fine has the voice of

a soldier, in his part of would-be dictator, but the uniform hints of Laurel

and Hardy or Major Hoople in its red and orange.

The parts of a diplomat

and a major art minor ones handled by Nate Elbaum and George
Strong, even though their opportunities for real acting were a minus quan-
tity. So also with the radicals, John Hesselbein and Isador Dickman, the

former quietly but well handled, the latter overdramatic.

The remainder of

the roles were bits and fulﬁlled by Jeanne Osborn, Louis Misko, and Frank

Adams.

The king, in all senses of the word, was Carl Swartz, timid, be-

wildered, humorous, explosive, and lordly.
Two disappointments: we always thought that a queen should be referred
to as “your excellency” or “your highness” or, at least, “madam,” but never

“mam.” '

Student Groups Will
Ask Student Opinion

—.:.._.

Meet With Utility Heads

By Israel L. Goldberg
Pitt News Council Writer

During the ﬁrst four hours Friday
morning, every Pitt student will be
contacted in Student council's drive
for lowered trolley fares.

According to Scott Turner, E34,
chairman of the combined Pitt, Du-
quesne, and Carnegie Tech campaign
for decreased rates, 6,000 ballots are
being printed for the survey. In each
class, appointed representatives will
distribute and explain the purpose of
the blanks, and will ask all students
to answer the four questions shown
elsewhere on this page.

Professors will allot several min-
utes of their classes to the poll, ﬁnal
ﬁgures of which will be used in nego-
tiations with the Pittsburgh Railways
company. This week, representatives
of Pitt, Tech, and Duquesne will again
meet to compare results of drives on
the three campuses, and will formu-
late plans for conferences with the
railways organization.

The University administration, said
Turner yesterday, is with Student
council 100 per cent in its move for
lowered fares. “We expect to have
collected from the 10,000 students, in
the three colleges,” he declared,
“enough information to show exactly
how much can be gained or how much
lost by rate reduction. We expecct
the cooperation of everyone in this
drive, so that we can present accurate
ﬁgures to the utility.”

Board Discusses
Safety Measures

J. W. Hallock Receives Place In
Industrial Group

Three important safety measures
were discussed at the meeting of the
State Industrial Safety board in Har-

risburg last Thursday, to which J. W.
Hallock, secretary of the General
Alumni association, was recently ap-
pointed by Governor Pinchot.

Two of these measures concerned
the health of the workers in indus-
tries. The ﬁrst concerned the degree
of carbon disulphide in the air that
would not affect the health of the
workers. This condition is found in
textile industries, where excess
amounts of carbon disulphide in the
air affect the nervous system of the
workers and often lead to insanity.
The second was on the amount of
sylicate particles in the air that would
lead to silicosis, an infection of the
lungs. This condition is found in
quarrying, metal polishing and certain
foundry operations.

The third discussion centered on
the question of why there are so few
prosecutions of the violators of state
safety measures.

Dean Holbrook Addresses
Engineering, Mines Group

 

 

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the School
of Engineering, will speak on “En-
trance Requirements and Curriculum
of the Schools” before the University

Alumni association at their discussion
meeting on “School Betterment” to-
night at 8 o’clock in Room 1301, Ca-
thedral.

At the ﬁrst monthly luncheon meet-
lng of the year at the downtown
YMCA on November 7, the associa-
tion voted to sponsor a luncheon on
the second Wednesday of each month.
These luncheons will be in Room 211,
Pittsburgh YMCA. J. F. Collins,
CE19, chairman of the luncheon com-
mittee, requests that all Pittsburgh
engineering and mines alumni attend
the monthly luncheon without fur-
ther notice.

Suggestions Made For Possible
Legislation By Group

Today the Pitt News prints a ballot
on which students can suggest legis-
lation for Student council discussion.

The ballot has been made available
so that, in the words of Jules Green,
C35, “Council may take up vital stu-
dent problems which we might other-
wise miss. This method of seeking
student opinion will allow us to dis-
cuss present issues of undoubted im-
portance."

Green suggested the ballot at a.
council meeting last month, and
moved that similar blanks be printed
once each semester. The one printed
today will be found in the lower left-
hand corner on page two.

Boxes will be placed in Alumni hall,

Student Chest Drive

. HE LARGEST AND MOST CONCENTRATED drive
for funds ever staged on the Pitt campus opened at

noon yesterday with a luncheon of 400 workers who, dur- ,

ing the next two weeks, will canvass the University stu-
dent body. Combining campaigns and tag days of sev-
eral organizations on campus, the student chest affair
‘bids for the support of every student.

With prospects of little or no decrease in the rolls of
the unemployed in Pittsburgh during the approaching
winter, welfare agencies ﬁnd themselves at a loss to take
adequate care of the thousands who will have to depend
on the Welfare Fund for their sustenance this winter.
With mounting costs in prices of clothes and foodstuffs,
the agencies face prospects of a shortage of money for
welfare purposes.

Students at the University, in the trend of conditions,
ﬁnd themselves pressed ﬁnancially. Many are doing
without necessary textbooks; others without lunch;
scores ﬁnd it difficult to pay even tuition. Conditions
make it difficult for college students, who still are de-
pendents to a great extent, to subscribe to welfare funds
and student chest drive. However, despite three years of
“skimping,” the results of last year’s campaign for funds
on the campus proved that students, even in their acute
ﬁnancial situation, are among the first to give.

We feel that the Student Chest drive on the campus
will result in absolute success. We feel that students

of the University will do without lunch, without an occa--.

sional movie, without some little petty luxury. Students
will feel that the amount they give is unimportant. To
give, and give freely, that is the aim of every Pitt stu-
dent during the next two weeks.

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

Editor's Note:—The opinions expressed in this col-
umn are the personal views of the writer and are
not to be taken to be in conformance with the edi-
torial policy of the Pitt News.

 

T IS BEING PREDICTED that a return to the mon-
archial form of government will take place in Ger-
many some time this winter or next spring. According
to the reports, a king will be installed through the mach-
inations of Hitler, in order to forestall the “second revo-
lution.”

There is a basis to such reports, since it is no secret
that Hitler’s policies have not satisﬁed a great mass of
his middle-class followers. The Fascist movement in
Germany, as in other countries, received its main sup-
port from the middle class, which was beguiled by all
sorts of promises leading it to believe that a middle-
class paradise was in the offing. Thus, during his long
and strenuous campaign for supremacy, Hitler stated
that department stores were to be restricted in their
operations and trade combinations were to be restrained.
The small retailer was to be protected in every possible
way and the government of Germany was to be a govern-
ment of and for the small storekeeper and the white-
collar class.

ITLER, HOWEVER, AFTER GAINING power, has

fulﬁlled none of these promises. The department
stores are still operating in full force. Great trade
groups are still very strong. Through a policy which
raised the price of foods, Hitler has worked severe hard-
ships upon the consumer, while enabling large landown-
ers to accumulate heavy proﬁts. And there has been no
hint of a possible division of the estates of the Junkers,
which many Fascist followers desired.

Hitler, of course, would have found it difficult indeed
to carry out the intentions publicized before the revolu-
tion. He has received his largest ﬁnancial contributions
from leading German industrialists and it was their in-
terests he had at heart. A great German steel magnate,
Thyssen, by name, was Hitler’s outstanding bulwark, ﬁ-
nancially, during the period of Hitler’s struggle for
power. Since the revolution, as a reward for his serv-
ices, Thyssen has been made virtual dictator of the
steel and iron industrial area of Germany.

The German dictator’s action in the interests of the
wealthy classes has not failed to arouse bitter anger in
a group within his party. This group has advocated a
“second revolution” in which the great landowners
would be dispossessed and the rich merchants destroyed
as a power, in line with Hitler’s public pronouncements.
Hitler, however, has thus far very successfully prevented
such a “second revolution” and will prevent it in the
future.

HE RADICAL MOVEMENT WITHIN the German

Fascist party is likely to gain a little strength as the
winter goes on. In order to quiet it, rumor has it that
Hitler will cause street ﬁghting to take place in Berlin,
and then bring in the king, with the rioting as an excuse
for such an action.

The installation of the king can only strengthen Hit-
ler's position, since the army, whose loyalty is doubtful

at present, will swear allegiance to the king, who, in
turn, will be dominated by Hitler. A monarchy will also
placate Hindenburg, who is still suspicious of the revolu-
tion and whose inﬂuence is still substantial. Hitler’s po-
sition, at present, is very solid, anyway, and there seems
little chance of any effective opposition making itself
felt for years. Control of propaganda machinery, of the
entire governmental organization, and of military forces
has put Hitler in a spot where, even if the people do
ﬁnally lose faith in him, he will be able to crush any re-
sentment. And there is no question that Hitler is solid-
ly backed by the German people in his foreign policies,
aggressive as they are. These foreign policies are al-
most certain to cause war, sooner or later, a war which
it is not particularly pleasing to think about.

It seems likely that Hitler will be able to maintain his
rule as long as he restrains from armed conﬂict. But
when he eventually leads Germany to war, then he will
probably lose control as a new revolution, and a radical
one, takes place. Then too, perhaps, will the disastrous
and vicious effects of Hitlerism, with its destruction of a
glorious culture, be erased—that is, if the war has not
desﬁoyed all culture more completely than even Hitler
cou .

‘Hill And Dalers End Season

With Lengthy Victory List

 

Notre Dame Only Team To Defeat Panther Harriers In
Five Starts; Wagenhouser Tops Score

 

By Charlie Ruch

The victory over Carnegie gives the
Panther harriers an impressive rec-
ord for the season. Losing only to
a. great Notre Dame aggregation, led
by Bob King, Canadian Olympic cham-
pion, the local hill-and-dalers swept
through to decisive victories over
Westminster, Miami, West Virginia.
and Carnegie Tech.

The combination of Albright.
VVagenhouser, Lawrence, Kirkpatrick,
and Musico was too much for the
Westminster Titans in the opening
meet and these ﬁve boys crossed the
ﬁnish line together to account for a
perfect cross-country score, 15-40.

Miami university’s Ohio conference
champions of 1932 were not much
more of a test for the Panthers.
Wagenhouser, Kirkpatrick, Albright
and Lawrence ﬁnished in a dead heat
for the ﬁrst four places, while George
Cook took a ninth -place to account
for Pitt’s 19 points. Miami had a
score of 36.

The following Saturday found the
Pitt harriers at South Bend, Indiana,
where they met the Irish cross-coun-
try team and subsequently lost their
ﬁrst meet of the season by three
points. Wagenhouser ﬁnished a scant
yard behind the Canadian champ a.nd
Albright took fourth place for the
Panthers. Kirkpatrick was sixth,
Musico was eighth, and Bill Lawrence
captured ninth place, running the
Pitt score to 29, which is just three
points more than 2.6, and therein lies
the tale of the lone loss.

Journeying to West Virginia the
week after, the Panthers had little
more than a breeze in the meet with
the Mountaineers. Vvagenhouser and
Albright ﬁnished arm in arm for the
ﬁrst two places and they were fol-
lowed by Kirkpatrick, Lawrence, and

Musico, who ﬁnished in the very same

manner to complete a perfect score.
Watkins also ﬁnished before a West
Virginia runner came into view of the
ﬁnish line.

Including the score of Friday's meet
with Carnegie, Pitt has a. record of
101 points as against 175 for their op-
ponents. ’Wagenhouser was an out-
standing performer on the team this
year, ﬁnishing ahead of or on par
with all Panther runners in every
meet, except the one Friday. Albright
was close behind tying with Wagen-
houser in all but the Notre Dame
race.

The freshman harriers went their
varsity brothers one better, going
through a strenuous campaign unde-
feated. Schenley, Peabody, Oliver,
South Hills, Westinghouse, and Lang-
ley high schools were taken into the
Pitt camp quite handily. Langley,
boasting a team made up of practic-
ally the same runners who captured
the 1932 city high school champion-
ships, gave the frosh their stiffest
test. The West Virginia Little Moun-
taineers were the only collegiate op-
ponents the Panther plebes met, and
the local boys took that one, 22-23.

A summary of the freshman season
ﬁnds a totally clean slate in seven
starts. Harold Tost was the ﬁrst man
to ﬁnish for Pitt in every meet, the
speedy red-head capturing the ﬁrst
places in all runs but the one with
West Virginia, when Gedwalis, a
freshman sensation, beat him out.
George Prosnik was second to Tost
in places won, while Radosevich, Leg-
gin, and Beachler ﬁgured prominently
in the string of triumphs.

The harriers have two more im-
portant engagements. One is in the
IC4A meet in New York on November
20 and the other is in the AMA meet
four days later. The Pitt representa-
tives for the races are not yet
known.

Webber. Last night at nine
o’clock in the studios of station
KDKA, editors of the Panther
presented him the Panther Award
of Honor for hi-s work in advanc-
ing radio broadcasting “from
just a. bunch of blurbs and burps
to a really ﬁne science.” Editors
admit, however, that his getting
the H. P. Davis award for diction
might have had something to do
with it.

Webber, who for three years
has been associated with KDKA,
came to the pioneer station from
WCAE; originally he hails from
Boston where the citizens speak
the purest of English, and his
diction shows it. The Davis award
recognized his excellent diction.
and now Panther comes forward

to verify it with a plaque which
replicates the Panther coat of

Golden Panthers Meet Undefeated, Untied Nebraska Eleven Saturday

 

Cornhuskers, Big Six Conference
Title Holders, Likely ‘To Give
Pitt Team Plenty Of Opposition

 

Scoreless Games Dot
Records Of Previous
Meetings

 

Next week—the Nebraska Corn-

huskers!

And next week another big job for
Jock Sutherland’s football team. The
Cornhusker eleven this year is one of
the select few undefeated and untied
top-ranking teams in the country.
Last Saturday it copped the Big Six
conference title by defeating Kansas,
which startled the football world by
holding Notre Dame to a scoreless tie
in their ﬁrst game of the season, 12
to 0.

Dana X, Bible’s boys are always big
and tough. Last year Pitt’s Golden
Panthers, Eastern champs, went out
to Lincoln, favorites to win, but came
away well satisﬁed with a scoreless
tie. The big gun of the Nebraska at-
tack that day was a gentleman-full-
back by the name of Sauer. Mr.
Sauer is still one of Mr. Bible’s star
pupils and from all reports his favorite
stunt is ripping opposing lines to
pieces.

The Cornhuskers this year are also
touted to have a ﬁne passing attack,
something which they have lacked in
the past, The combination which has
clicked for them best this year is
from this same Mr. Sauer to Kil-
bourne, an end, and from Masterson,
their quarterback, to Kilbourne.

Saturday’s game will be the eighth
meeting of the Panthers and the Corn-
huskers. The series started way back
in 1921 when the Nebraska team
copped its only victory, 10 to 0. The
two teams did not meet again until
1927 when Gibby Welch, Whitey
Hagen, et al in a thrilling encounter
in the Stadium scored a 21 to 13 vic-
tory over the mid-western team. The
Panthers won the games played in
1929 and 1931 a.nd played scoreless
ties in 1928 and 1932.

Mud, Dukes Hold
Favored Panther
Team To 7-0 Score

“Four Horsemen” Unseated As
Pitt Line Dominates Play;
Sleet, Rain Mar Game

Weinstock Outstanding

 

By James Nelson

On a muddy ﬁeld, which made scor-
ing almost impossible Coach Jock
Sutherland’s Golden Panthers put a
stop to an eight-game winning streak
of Coach Elmer Layden’s highly
touted Duquesne eleven Saturday at
the Stadium by handing them a 7 to
0 setback.

The Panthers started a touchdown
march early in the first quarter which
terminated when acting-captain Mike
Sebastian’s forward pass to O’Dell
fell incomplete over the goal line_ In
the second period Duquesne unleashed
a passing attack which netted them
35 yards. One pass, Strutt to Kran-
kotawas good for 15 yards and an-
other, Deluca to Krankota gave the
Dukes a 20-yard gain to place the ball
on the Pitt 42-yard line. After batting
down a pass Pitt regained the ball
when Niccolai’s attempt for a. ﬁeld
goal failed.

In the third Quarter Pitt lost the
ball on downs on the Duquesne 34-yard
line. Skladany recovered a Duke
fumble which gave the Panthers pos-
session of the ball on Duquesne’s 26-
yard line. In two tries Weinstock
crashed through the center of the line
for a ﬁrst down on the Duke 15. The
Duquesne line then dug in and re-
pulsed four tries _at their line and
took the ball on downs on their own
6. Zaninelli punted to Matesic who
ran the punt to the Duke 35-yard
mark. On the next play Pitt was
penalized 5 yards for offside. O’Dell
tossed a pass to Matesic to give the
Panthers a ﬁrst down on the Duke 17-
yard line. Weinstock and Matesic ad-
vanced the ball to the Duke 8-yard
line in three tries. On the next play
Weinstock also kicked the extra point
with O’Dell holding the ball to give
the Panthers seven points. ,
Duquesne had a scoring opportunity
in the ﬁnal ‘period when Powell re-
covered a bad pass from center to
give the Dukes possession of the ballI
on the Pitt 24-yard line. However,
the Panthers broke up three passes
and smothered a line play to take the
ball on downs. In the closing mo-
ments of the game, Kliskey intercept-
ed a Duke pass to give the Panthers
the ball on the Duke 47_ The game
ended three plays later with the Pitt

team in possession of the ball, The

Coach Corr Orders Distance Swim
To Condition Men

 

 

Heavy practice sessions have been
the order of the week for the Pitt
natators as they prepare for the Al-
legheny Mountain association meet
scheduled for November 25, at the
Pittsburgh Athletic association.

Coach Pat Corr ordered plenty of
distance swimming last week in or-
der to have the squad in the best
possible physical condition for the
pointing process which will begin
next week. There is enough inter-
team competition to keep the squad
going at full speed although the relay
race tonight between teams “A” and
“B” is probably the reason for the
added zeal which marked last week’s
practice sessions. Team “A” will be
composed of: Adlersberg, Chambers,
Norton, and Stinner. Lewis, Schmeil-
er, Denny, and Lindberg will form
team “B.”

in the association, which were sold at
ithe beginning of the year for $2, will
of course, be valid. However, accord-
ing to the committee, a close check
will be carried on at the door to guard
against the transferring of member-
ship tickets for this affair.

Panther Harriers Top
Tartan Runners 23-32

Running over frozen ground made
treacherous by snow’, the Pitt cross-
country team eked out a 23 to 32 vic-
tory over their city rivals, the Car-
negie Tech Tartans, last Friday.

For the second time this year, the
Panthers failed to take ﬁrst place in
a run. Gioloma, Tartan leader, ﬁnished
ten yards ahead of Sam Musico to
win the event. Gioloma’s time was 23
minutes and 52 seconds, while Musico
was clocked in 23 minutes, 58 sec-
onds.

Albright ran in third place for Pitt,
the Tartans took fourth, Kirkpatrick
gave the Panthers a ﬁfth place, and
Wagenhouser, running in spite of a
badly injured foot, was sixth. Law-
rence ended the Pitt scoring by cross-
ing the ﬁnish line in seventh posi-
tion. -
