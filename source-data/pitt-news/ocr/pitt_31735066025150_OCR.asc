Theta Chi frat
to reorganize

under judicial
board penalty

By Heather Gahres
Sta_[)" Writer

Theta Chi fraternity will be reorganized
this fall as the result of an incident in
which two sorority members were
assaulted at the Theta Chi house by a
member of the fraternity.

The decision, which also involves the
halving of Theta Chi’s membership, is a
compromise between the fraternity and
the Inter-Fraternity Council.

The decision stems from a February
incident, in which two members of Alpha
Delta Pi sorority were allegedly physically
assaulted during an open party at the
house. _

Jason Skelley, president of Theta Chi,
said that at the party, “Two guys were
having a pillow fight and bumped into
some girls.” Skelley said a verbal fight°
followed, and the women were then asked
repeatedly to leave.

Pitt audit

 finds no

illegal use
of monies

By John Temple
suqr Writer

After spending eight months
and $160,000 to review Pitt's
books, state Auditor General
Barbara Hafer criticized Pitt
for what she called
questionable spending of state
funds. Hafer did not release
any information regarding
specific expenditures.

Hafer, who last fall attacked
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s unwillingness to
open Pitt's books to public
scrutiny, also avoided
answering directly how much
questionable spending the
review had uncovered. When

pressed, she said, “It’s large.

to leave and slapped some of the members
as they were being escorted out of the
house. Michael Beckman, a Theta Chi
member, then shoved one of the women

out of the door, causing her to fall and hit 0

her head. ‘

Ellie Miller, president of Alpha Delta Pi,
said the incident began when two members
of Theta Chi hit the women over the head
with a couch pillow, and it progressed into
a verbal argument. The women then began
to leave the party, she said.

“She was half way out of the door when
Michael Beckman came up from behind
her and grabbed her by the shoulders. He
pushed and shook her 12 to 15 feet
through the house. He then pushed her
through the second door. He pushed her
so hard that she was knocked off her feet,
causing her to land ﬂat on her back and
head as she hit the cement,” Miller said.

When the woman’s friends found her,
they asked five Theta Chis to use their
phones to call the police. “They were
denied the right to use the phone to call
the police and an ambulance,” Miller said.
The women went to another fraternity
house and called the campus police.

Shock, hostility, and anger
were the feelings expressed by
many at the last pre-law society
meeting, when the president
of the society, David Snyder,
suggested barring all
homosexuals from the society.

Snyder began by explaining,
“No definite stance has been
taken. The rationale is quite
similar to the philosophy
society. No firm, concrete
decisions have been made."

He told the group it was not
a protest, but a serious matter
to be dealt with. “If we say it's
a protest, then we come out as
Students for Peace. The issue
doesn’t get addressed. Then
it's just a protest, nothing for
the administration to address.
The issue becomes‘ trivialized.
All we’re trying to do is get the
administration to confront the
issue. When you have a society

‘that is not doing itsymbolically,

the administration is forced to
face the issue," Snyder said.

‘ Snyder assured the members
he had the best interests of the
society in mind.

The question was not why to
ban bisexuals, gays and
lesbians, but why not, Snyder
said. He then cited Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s decision to allow
ROTC to remain on campus
despite the Department of
Defense's policy barring
homosexuals. The rationale is
that if ROTC is allowed to
discriminate and is still
permitted on campus, then the
pre-law society should be able
to ban homosexuals, and remain
on campus.

“The whole university is a
non-discriminatory estab-
lishment. Even though ROTC
has Department of Defense ties,
they're still on our turf and
should follow our rules," Snyder

said.

“For some reason, the
inconsistency isn’t called out
that the ROTC does that.
O’Connor opened the window.
You can't expect air not to
come in," Snyder said.

But many members, officers
and observers were strongly
opposed to Snyder’s
announcement and said he was
ruining the reputation and
endangering the future of_ the
pre-law society.

“If you feel strongly about
this, get 10 people together
and form «your own society,”
Erin Claypoole, a member of
the society, said.

“I had no idea they were
going to discriminate. I joined
this society because I'm
interested in the field of law. I
will quit if they do this [ban gay
students from the societyl,”
member Kathryn Jones said.

Student -Government Board
members Bryan Bender and

Jacob Brody attended the
meeting to find out exactly
whatthe society was going to
do and to inform them of the
consequences that would

happen if they did go through .

with such a motion.

“If you choose to discriminate
against homosexuals, you will
not receive money or
recognition,” Brody said. “We
will not tolerate discrimination. ”

“I really think [Brody] didn't
get it. He didn't know what
was going on  He shouldbe
responsible for understanding
the issues. Everyone should
be, really,” Snyder said.

After more than an hour of
discussion the meeting ended
without a decision. It had been
agreed that at the next meeting
the issue would be further
discussed and a vote would be
taken as to what the society
would do; however Snyder has
since decided against that.

Pitt rideshare offers help to commuters left stranded by PAT strike

By John Temple
Staﬁ" Writer

The thousands of commuting
Pitt students and employees who
were left stranded Monday by the
Port Authority Transit strike may
find help at Pitt Rideshare.

The program matches
carpoolers, runs a wide—ranging
van service for workers with
regular hours and offers other
information about Oakland
commuting. Program Director
Kathleen Miller said her workers
have been working overtime on

the phones during the past week
as concern over the impending
strike grew.

“We've just been bombarded,”
she said.

Phones rang almost
continuously in the Rideshare
offices on Monday, as Miller
dispensed information and advice
about commuting during the
strike. Miller said commuters who
live in Squirrel Hill, Point Breeze
and Shadyside might make better
time and avoid hassles if they
walked to Pitt.

For those living farther from

the city, Rideshare can search
through computer files for
matches. Either riders can
alternate driving days or one
person "can drive and be
reimbursed for expenses by the
other riders.

“That way, people without a
car just chip in for the extra
costs," Miller said.

The free carpool-matching
service is usually a better option
than the van service for students
because of the van’s irregular
hours. A small percentage of the

approximately 10,000 active

names in the Rideshare computer
are students, Millersaid, although
many students have called in the
last-week.

Although printouts of carpooler
matchups usually take about two
minutes to print out, the confusion
during the past few days has
caused a backlog, Miller said.
People inquiring about
carpooling can make the process
easier by giving adequate
information about their situations
when they call and stopping by
the office to fill out a form and
pick up a matchup list.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor issued a letter to the
university community on Monday
which refers questions about
parking availability to Rideshare.
To prepare for the strike, two
extra phones were installed in
the Rideshare office.

The program also provides a
van service that runs to various
suburbs of Pittsburgh. But this
service is more suited to workers
with regular nine-to—five shifts,
according to Miller. Riders pay a
monthly fee, usually around $65,
for a seat in the van.

referred to his Student Rights

of animal-protection issues,
introduced this bill which will
allow students in grades K through
12 to refuse to dissect animals
without being penalized. It has
already been passed in the House
and is going to the Senate.

Murphy said that regarding
most of the animal-rights issues
there are no “friendly
committees.” “There's a myth in
Pennsylvania that if you're against
hunters or sportsmen you're dead
politically," he said.

Murphy said that there are 1.5

licenses in Pennsylvania. But
Murphy added that if advocates
band together politically there
will be “an enormous amount of

Pitt lecture analyzes
role of autobiography
in Italian literature

By Rebecca Wilkins

Staﬂ“ Writer ’

Deﬁning the essence of autobiography as a literary form’ is a
problematic task, according to Professor Albert Mancini.

Mancini spoke on “Writing the Self: Autobiography in Italian
Literature in the Cinquecento” before spring break.

He is the author of several books and a professor at Ohio
State University

Mancini cited two definitions of autobiography: autobiography
as any text wherein the narrator speaks of himself and
autobiography as self-portrait.

“Strictly speaking, autobiography is not a recollection of
one’s past; it is an artifact, a literary construct,” he said. “The
essence of current criticism of autobiography has consisted
largely of distinguishing it from other literary forms with which
it overlaps, such as the diary, the memoir, the epistolary novel
and the biography.”

He said that the purposes of his lecture were to gain a greater
- understanding of the specific cultural and social conditions
surrounding autobiographical writers, to study the motives for
writing and reading autobiography during the late Renaissance
and to better understand the evolution of this literary form.

“My intent in this paper will be to examine the major
characteristics of six important autobiographical texts in a
particular period setting,” he said.

The texts were all written by Italian authors in the late 16th
and early 17th centuries.

Secondo Lancellotti is the author of Della Vita.

According to Mancini, this text contains all the motives for
writing autobiography.

SNZI/IA makes demands to Pitt administration 

The SNMA claimed this incident ' 
is only one of several documented I 

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

In order to,gain support and
remedy the ongoing insensitivity
and racism that black medical
students face at Pitt, the Student
National Medical Association held
a press conference to present a
list of demands to Pitt
administrators last Thursday.

The SNMA’s action stemmed
from a racially motivated incident
in the medical school earlier this
month.

According to an SNMA press
release, a black medical student
asked a secretary in the Oakland
Emergency Medical Center
building where its men’s room
was. After returning from the rest

 

room, the secretary told the
student to leave the building.
Allegedly, the student explained
he was a medical student and
showed his identification, but the
secretary continued to demand
that he leave the building. The
secretary then called security and
also asked» a physician to help
forcibliy remove the student.
Although a white student veriﬁed
the man in question's identity, no
one listened. When security
arrived, the physician realized
that the man was in fact a medical
student.

Pitt’s School of Medicine Dean
George Bernier said an
investigation by the medical
school confirmed the account of
what occurred.

Transcendental chess provides new twist

By Scot Nespor

Staﬂ' Writer

l

Chess is an ever—evolving game.
It is one that matches one player’s
skill, concentration and logic
against those of another player.
People are always trying to
change the game in an effort to
add spice and more action.

One of those people is Maxwell
J. Lawrence.
Lawrence has invented

transcendental chess. He feels
that orthochess (regular chess) is
“at best a musty, boring exercise.
Few games have a more daunting
or intimidating format than
orthodox chess’s opening book.”

The opening book is made up
of the first moves that a player
uses in starting a game of chess.

A If a player uses the appropriate

moves, the player will be well set

up to win the game. To avoid the
opening moves, Lawrence’s
version places pieces at random
on the board. This allows for
immediate action.

Lawrence said he feels that
people who have memorized the
opening book have an advantage
over those who have not. He said
transcendental chess will
eliminate this “exceedingly
negative and unattractive aspect
of orthochess."

Pitt's Chess Club does not like
Lawrence’s new rules. '

Club member Jeff Myers said
that “there is little reason to
change." He said that there are
two types of players, beginners
and advanced. .

According to Myers, beginners
do not memorize the opening-
book moves. They spend a lot of
time “experimenting with new

moves.” Myers said that most
people on the advanced level
have memorized an opening
move “and have their own twist
on opening theory." A downfall
to having the pieces placed
randomly on the board, according
to Myers, is that “the opening
leads to positional themes” and
sets the player up to defeat his
opponent. The “set-up by some
random draw will lead to an
uncoordinating thread of boring
moves."

Fellow chess player Jim Jones
agreed.

Jones said that Lawrence ’s rules
sound uninteresting and very
tedious. “The mechanics of
[transcendental chess] are too
complicated and never will be a
popular alternative. Based on
those rules, you might as well ﬂip
a coin and see who wins."

And Barb Cvrkel and Valaska Davidson, volunteer one-on-
ones, gave individualized attention to a severely retarded boy
who could walk but who could not communicate at all.

These are justfour of the over 400 Pitt students who gave up
a Saturdayto participate in the annual Hand-in-Hand Festival.
All four will be back again this year on March 28. Why are they
doing it?

“It’s a great experience to see the kids so happy,” Bachman
said. The “kids” are the nearly 400 children with mental and
physical disabilities from over 20 schools in the area who take
part in the festival.

LSC offers finals help

By Donna Pesansky
For tbe Pitt News

For students who want to
approach final exams more
conﬁdently, sharpen and improve
study techniques and become
better organized, the Learning
Skills Center can help. The LSC is
offering its last series of
workshops in preparation for
finals starting this week.

The workshop will be run
similar to those earlier in the
semester but will specialize in
preparing for ﬁnal exams, said
Dr. Rosalind Jones, director of
the Learning Skills‘Center. Jones
said the workshops are designed
to keep students from falling into
a cramming mode by the end of
the term.

“I want to become more
efficient,” saidJeffLango, a junior
who is enrolled in the workshop.
He said his grades aren’t bad, but
there is room for improvement.

The workshops meet for two
hours, once a week over four
weeks. The topics for the
workshops are textbook reading,
note taking, memory and time
management and test-taking

; techniques. Jones said there will

also be a special session on how
to relieve stress due to ﬁnals.
“Efﬁcient and effective" is the
motto for the course, said Christine
Moleski, the student academic
counselor teaching the workshop.
She ‘said the biggest problem

yfacing students is procrastination.

Students who want to eliminate
this problem before ﬁnals should
find a quiet, comfortable place to
study now, according to Moleski.
She said they should look back at
past tests and visit their professors
during office hours.

On the first day of the
workshop, a goal worksheet is
given out. The students are to list
their present grade, then their
desired grade for the course.
Moleski said she will do whatever
needs to be ‘done to achieve that
goal.

The workshop is set up to be
close and personal, Moleski said.
The students are encouraged to
ask questions about their speciﬁc
problems. She said the students
who attend the workshops range
from math majors to English
majors, from first-year to graduate
students to returning students.
Moleski said they want to reﬁne
their study skills.

“I want to use anything that the
university will give me,” Susie
Blocher said. She is returning to
Pitt to major in Math. Blocher
said she has been in school longer
than most students have been
alive. With work, classes and her
family, Blocher said she needs to
make the most out of every
minute, which is why she enrolled
in the course.

The workshops start this week
and run until the middle of April.
To register for the workshop or
for individual counseling, call the
LSC at 648-7920.

Students choose cafeteria menu.

By Donna Pesansky
For The Pitt News

Students who complain about the menu in the

cafeteria will only have themselves to blame.

The University Dining Service invited students
to plan the cafeteria menu for three weeks. The
results of the program, called “Students . . . This
is YOUR Menu,” were implemented this week,
said Ron Seewald, director of operations for
DAKA, the food-service contract company which
services dining halls on Pitt’s campus.

“When we said the students get to plan the
menu, that is purely what we meant,” Seewald
said. Students were asked to plan lunch and
dinner. They followed speciﬁc guidelines, set
up by dining-service dieticians, which follow
the American Dental Association’s and the
Surgeon General’s dietary regulations.

Students had to create a menu which involved
balancing nutrition while giving attention to
variety, texture, color, taste and eye appeal,
Seewald said.

The menu students created wasn't “remarkably

different from the regular one.” He said students ,
chose the usual favorites: hamburgers, chicken’

patties and french-fried shrimp, although there
were special requests for items such as vegetarian
sniffed peppers.

“It’s a good idea,” student Heather Hanna
said. “It’s about time they ﬁnally serve the food
we want."

She said her choices were cheesesteak
sandwiches for lunch and baked ﬁsh for dinner.
Other students said they would like to always
have a deli line at dinner but no onions in the
tuna ﬁsh.

Seewald said over 100 students participated in
the program, and the two top requests were for
fried shrimp and chicken cordon bleu.

The purpose of the program was to get

students involved and give them a sense of
control over the food they are eating, Seewald.

Seewald said they did their best to
accommodate everyone’s requests and would
continue to do so, so long as it stays within the
dining services’ ﬁnancial limits.

He said his top priorities are to maintain high
quality while keeping students’ costs at a
reasonable level. ’

On hand to help students make low-calorie,
healthy and good-tasting choices were
representatives from Student Health services,
cafeteria dieticians and several DAKA
cookbooks. _

Planning a menu becomes an “intellectual
concern,” Seewald said. It’s important to stop
and think about the right foods to eat. He said
once food is put in front of you, it becomes
“more emotional." People are less likely to
choose food that is good for them right there in
line. He said if more people thought about what
they ate, “a lot of places [in Oakland] would not
be in business."

Seewald, who started at Pitt in July, said prior
to his arrival there were many problems. He said

some managerial changes“ were ‘made and as‘"a ‘

result a new top food-service management team
was formed. Since the summer, the management
has been exclusively controlled by DAKA instead
of the previous arrangement which included
mostly university employees.

Seewald said the dining service on campus ’ '
will continue to experience many good changes
and he encourages new ideas or suggestions. By
working with various campus groups, such as
the Food Committee (which works in connection
with the Resident Student Association), amazing
things have been accomplished. Examples, he
said, include the addition of Fru ity Pebbles to the

. breakfast-cereal bar. Seewald promised even

more exciting things for the future.

affiliated institutions reminding them of
their responsibility to adhere-to university
policy regarding discriminatory practices.

‘ ‘oAll members of the medical school

community participate in an ongoing
educational program that explores personal

prejudices and behaviors while informing‘
. them of the value of cultural ‘diversity. V I »

The group also called on Bernierto

I fulﬁll some of their demands.

The SNMA asked Bernier to address
cultural diversity during his State of the

 Medical School Address in the spring with
proposed strategies for change. Also, it

asked him to write and submit his personal
opinion and concerns regarding
institutional racism and valuing diversity
for publication in local medical journals.

The students also requested the dean
meet with African-American medical
students on a quarterly basis to discuss
ongoing concerns.

A new academic-grievance process
should be designed and implemented as
part of the new curriculum, and a system
tliatitracks thesubjective grading of African-
Americans in comparison with other
students was also demanded by the SNMA.

The group expressed its desire to work
with the medical-school administration in

order to reach a resolution.

“Because we are committed to academic
success, we will stop at nothing to address
the problems of bigotry, insensitivity and
racism within the medical school,” the
SNMA’s press release stated.

After the‘ press release was read, the
group invited Bernier to respond to the
state'me'nts and demands.

‘ Bernier started by addressing the issue

of racism in general. “These events have
confirmed’ in the minds of many that
racism, conscious or unconscious, operates
within our society and within our school,”
he said.

The dean told the group that one of its
demands had already been met. Both the
physician and staff member involved in
the incident had received written
reprimands, he said. He also expressed his
willingness and desire to meet with the
medical group and address the concerns it
has. “It is critical for dialogue to proceed,
and we are very committed for that to
happen," Bernier said.

The president of the SNMA, Seth
Borquaye, said he was pleased with the
outcome of the press conference.

“I'm happy with the dean's statement.
He agreed to dialogue so we can take care
of this incident,” Borquaye said.

“We have the rational motives, that is
to say apology and testimonials, and
the emotional motives, that is to say
measuring oneself with one’s time and
finding a sense for one’s life,” he said.

A Girolamo Cardano, author of De Vita
Pmprta, was a mathematician, physician
and astrologer as well as a writer.

Mancini said that this text was written
as a project of self-rehabilitation.

“He designs anger and outrage
through self-castigationby highlighting
the humanity and inhumanity of his
major exploits, sexual, familial,
academic and professional, in a strange
but effective mixture of bravado and
anxiety that lurks behind all of us,” he
said.

Gabriello Chiabrera was a well~
known literary figure in his time.

In regard to Chiabrera’s writing, “One
should speak of the reworking of the
common biographical formula of Greek
and Latin poetry,” Mancini said.

Mancini said that Chiabrera wanted
to reform Italian verse by imitating
Greek poets.

Guido Bentivoglio wrote an

autobiographical text narrating events
which he had witnessed and of which
he was often the protagonist.

According to «Mancini, “The declared
intent is one of recovery of the past for
personal use and gratification.”

Bentivoglio’s work is both a memorial
to the author/protagonist and a piece
of history. .

Paolo Paruta, a Venetian statesman,
and Carlo de’ Dottori, a poet, wrote
autobiographical texts that attempt to
discover the true meaning of their lives
from a spiritual point of view.

“In these works, the recollection of
events of the past on the part of the
narrator/protagonist is meant to
dramatize the quest of a troubled soul
in search of healing and healing self-
knowledge,” Mancini said.

“As guides to the examination of the
individual conscience, [these six works
are] instrumental in the emergence of
the modern autobiography,” he said.

The lecture was the Department of
French and Italian’s seventh annual
Tucci Lecture and was co-sponsored by
the Western European Studies Program
and the Italian Club.

Audit

Continued from page 1
It’s a large number.”

Hafer’s press secretary, Steve
Schell, said the auditors did not
keep ‘track of the numerous
examples of excessive spending
the review uncovered while
scrutinizing an $829,057 sample
of Pitt’s state funds.

But it is highly unusual to not
keep track of questionable
expenditures while doing a
review, according to Barb
McElhaney of the auditing
firm .-_Ferraro, Krebs and
Associates.

“You would always have a
record [of these expenditures]
whenyou are through with the
review,” she said.

Despite the vagueness of her
report, Hafer was critical of Pitt’s
spending policies, saying that state
funds were being spent by

management above the dean level
an unrelated trips, entertainment,
membership fees to social clubs,
alcoholic beverages and business
luncheons.

She said that these managerial
perks only had to be approved
by a superior.

Hafer recommended that
guidelines be established in order
to control spending of the
approximately $130 million that
Pitt receives each year. Guidelines
would not prevent the same type
of spending,- but they would
force Pitt to use its own
money.

According to Hafer, this would
protect Pitt from negative
public reactions to certain
expenditures.

“The commonwealth funds go
to Pitt with only one guideline:
Spend it,” she said. “As a result,

the commonwealth may bei

inadvertently funding
expenditures which any citizen
would consider excessive.”
Hafer also introduced four plans
which would monitor Pitt’s state

funds and suggested that the state ‘

adopt one. _

When asked last week about
the possibility that these plans
might take away a large chunk of
state funding, forcing a tuition
increase, Schell said the auditor
general’s office had not
studied the potential effects of
the plans.

O'Connor said the suggested
plans are an issue for the
legislature.

Hafer’s report also attacked
Pitt’s Board of Trustees.

“The boardlost sight of its goal:
oversight," she said. "The board
had delegated much of its
authority to subcommittees and

simplyrubberstampedimportant
administrative issues that
appeared at the meetings.”

She added that a few members
actually ran the BOT and the
others were chosen for their ability
to provide money.

BOT Chairperson John Marous
denied
and explained that the- BOT is
already undergoing restructur-
ing.

Marous said Pitt is already
addressing the issues that Hafer
raised. ‘ ’

The report said the auditors
found no evidence of unlawful
activity in Pitt’s management of
state allocations.

‘ Marous said he was
pleased with the audit’s
results.

“Any time you ask the auditor
general to come in and examine
an institution this big and she

concludes happily that we are , ~

policies and procedures, there's

nothing unlawful here andthe,

said.

Hafer for coming in here and
doing the study and discovering
the same things that we
already knew all along,” he
said. ‘ '

Hafer decided‘ to review the 

university's books after ﬁnancial
scandals, surfaced last summer.
Though Hafer and Marous now
agree that Marous initiated the
audit, each claimed credit for it
last summer. ; ,
Hafer said her auditors
will soon be back at the
university to study more recen
records. -

The point of the motion was to

get people to ask if maybe there
was something inconsistent with
the ROTC policy and then to ask
if maybe they could do something
about it, according to Snyder.
“People saw the. buzz word
“discrimination,” and said, ‘Oh,
that's wrong,’ but they didn't stop
to ask why. So the pre-law society
is not going to [ban homosexuals]
because the message has already

been addressed. It wouldn't serve
any purpose to do it now. It's not
an issue for the society anymore.
It wouldn't force the admin-
istration to address the issue any
more then they have already as a
result of the past action," he said.
“The fact that our actions stirred
up controversy and the ROT C's
stance doesn't shows that people
don't know what's going on, and
[it] goes to show where homo-
phobia is working," he said.

Fraternity

Continued from page 1

Beckman pleaded guilty to the charges.

According to Skelley, the IFC judicial board’s
ruling gave the members of the fraternity two
choices. It could either retain all of its members,
give up its house and move into Brackenridge
Hall, or it could suspend all of its members and
retain the house.

Theta Chi submitted an alternative punishment
that allowed Theta Chi to keep the fraternity
house but reduce the number of its members
from 45 to somewhere between 16 and 24
members until the fall, when it could rebuild. The
suggestion was accepted by the judicial board

IFC Chief Justice Jeremy Weiss said, “We
accepted their proposal in lieu of their immense
concern, determination and dedication to save
their fraternity. The sanctions they voluntarily
imposed on themselves were more indicative of
their remorse over the incident and their
determination to better represent Theta Chi
fraternity." _ ’

Although the incident was not alcohol-related,
no alcohol will be permitted in the fraternity
house until the spring of 1994 as a result of the
reorganization.

According to Assistant Director of Public Safety

Gary Moses, Beckman was arrested at the scene
and pleaded guilty to charges of harassment in
city court. Beckman was fined $300 in addition
to court costs. He will also be tried by the
University of Pittsburgh’s judicial board.

Skelley said, “After the incident, we cleared
the party  We tried to call the police, but were
notified that they were already on their way.”

Moses said, “The officer did not think that
[Beckman] was drunk at the time of the incident.”

Due to the incident, Theta Chi had a hearing
in ‘front of the Inter-Fraternity Council’s judicial
board. Miller said Alpha Delta Pi was not out to
bash Theta Chi. “We're doing this to protect all
of the women on campus, so it won’t happen
again.”

The decision as to which brothers will remain
to rebuild the fraternity will be determined by a
committee of university officials, alumni,
undergraduate members and members of the
national fraternity office, who will also monitor
the actions of the fraternity.

The fraternity was also required to submit a
letter of apology tothe university community.

“I realize the seriousness of the incident, but
I thought it was blown out of proportion,”
Skelley said. I

Questionable spending

Eight months and $160,000 later, questionable spending
is the conclusion reached by state Auditor General
Barbara Hafer.

Hafer reviewed $829,057 of state funding. Unfortunately,
Hafer, who has been critical of Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s supposed unwillingness to open Pitt’s books,
was not specific in her report of what exactly was
determined to be “questionable.”

Even without specifics, Hafer called into question
certain expenditures in the area of trips, entertainment,
membership fees to social clubs, alcoholic beverages and
business luncheons. -

Also, Hafer criticized the Board of Trustees for granting
too much power to subcommittees. She said, “The board
had delegated much of its authority to subcommittees and
simply rubber stamped important administrative issues
that appeared at the meetings.” She criticized the Board
of T rustees_ for lacking “oversight” in the running of the
university. -

While the Board of Trustees may be restructuring, the
university’s credibility has been impaired. Even though
no unlawful transactions were discovered, questionable
spending seems to be an all too common ailment at Pitt.

Hafer suggested in the report that plans to monitor state-
money spending should be instituted. Greater
accountability will only help the university’s tattered
public image. _

University leadership must not forget its past mistakes.
It must drop its opposition to attempts to bring openness
to the university. For every mistake made and for every
questionable expenditure, sources of university revenue
will fall, leaving students to pay the bill.

PAT fare hike in future  

Public transportation in Pittsburgh came to a halt in
Pittsburgh on Monday and Tuesday. .

On Sunday, the Local 85 Amalgamated Transit Union,
representing roughly 2,700 workers, rejected an offer by
the Port Authority of Allegheny County. The picket signs
were up at 12:01 Monday morning. The last public-transit
strike, in 1976, lasted five days.

In response, ride-sharing programs and carpools are the
only ways some students and Pittsburgh-area commuters
will be able to reach their desired destinations. Public
transportation is just what it is: public. It impacts all of our
lives; it requires the concern of our entire community.

Clearly, a settlement like the one reached this weekend
in Philadelphia, seems reasonable. There union members
received a $500 “signing” bonus and a 3.5-percent cost-
of-living pay increase for the next three years.

This appears reasonable; however it will cause bus and
trolley fares to increase to $1.50. For some unknown
reason, there must be a bottomless hole in our public-
transportation unit. Certainly, our union wages are not out
of the ordinary when compared with other cities.

The real crisis is that the budgetary void will not be
solved in the process of remedying the strike. No matter
when the strike ends, fares most likely will increase. The
public will pay the price for leaks in PAT ’s spending.

Why is the supreme being always male?

We have all been taught about
how religion is supposed to serve
a sublime role in the human
experience. In a world where all
people struggle for themselves,
religion promises a community a
sacriﬁce of ego for the good of
something bigger than itself.
Church was said to be a
transcendental experience.
Witness the communal act of
eating the body and drinking the
blood of Jesus Christ in the

Catholic religion. In charismatic "

churches, followers spoke in
tongues as the force of the spirit
of god transcended them to
another plane. Communal singing
and offerings of fellowship are
common in most religions. It is in
these examples thatl consider
religion’s promise to be the most
realized.

But something’ went wrong,
and all of these wonderful values
were buried beneath the
subjugation and oppression of
other people.__

For me; the questions begin
with this:

Why is god/dess referred to as
a man? It just seems so unnatural
to me to think of a creator of the
universe as being male. In pre-
christian history, god/dess was
considered female because
women were closest to the
creation process (i.e. childbirth).
That makes some sense to me,
but why anthropomorphize
creation? V

Of all the living things in this
universe, the lﬂcelihood that that
which is responsible for this
existence is somehow human is
illogical. It just points to the
superstitious human need to have

After last Thursday's loss to the
Miami Hurricanes, calls went up
both in Pittsburgh and outside of
Madison Square Garden for head
coach Paul Evans’ head.

. Many fans vowed never to
 watch another Panther basketball
"" game until the once-touted savior

«Rob Mazur

 of Pitt basketball was disrobed

 and removed from the bench.
However this move may be a bit
hasty.

 The Panthers were simply guilty

 i oflookingaheadintheirschedule.

 V It happens all the time in college
basketball. How else would a
team like Richmond defeat
Syracuse in last year’s NCAA
tournament. Or Murray State
knock off North Carolina State a
few years before that? While that
does not make the practice of
looking past an opponent and
getting burned right, it's bound
to happen to even the best of
teams.

Many ‘fans penciled, no
chiseled, in a first-round win and
made plans around a Friday Pitt-
Georgetown matchu p. All the so-
called experts everywhere stated

 

It's a familiar contest in a strange setting: Pitt versus Penn State, but

on the basketball court.

The 17-15 Panthers will travel to State College to face the 21-7 Nittany
Lions in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament tonight
It'_s been over 10 years since these two hoop teams last squared off. It
was during the 1981-'82 season, when Pitt was a member of the Eastern

Eight.

This latest rendition of the famous rivalry has several sidebars,
including the paths of the respective teams. The Nittany Lions, a team
without a conference this year, is headed toward the Big Ten and can
use any NIT wins to bolster recruiting efforts. Pitt, on the other hand,
has lost its past two games, and the players voted not to accept the NIT
bid after the loss to Miami in the Big East Tournament. They were

overruled.

that the Big East was so tough
that any one of nine teams could
win it, but it would be a cold day
in the proverbial hot place before
the Hurricanes would even win a
tournament game, let alone the
whole mess.

This oversight came with
justifiable reason. Pitt had
defeated Miami twice in the
regular season by 30 and 22
points. Pitt was coming off an
ugly, season-ending loss to
Georgetown and needed at least
one, maybe two victories to
solidify its shot at a bid to the
NCAAs.

Miami came in with different
ideas, however. The Hurricanes
came ready to play. Even though
they only had one Big East win to
their credit (a 45-42 shocker over
St.'}ohn’s, which cost thejohnnies
a title), they showed signs of
tremendous improvement. In
their last three games, they beat
Florida International by five;
played eventual regular—season
champ Seton Hall tough, taking
the game into overtime; and lost
by five at Providence.

So they had their one shining
moment against Pitt, played

Panthers face Penn State in NIT tonight

Penn State's season has been just as strange as Pitt's in some
respects. After the Atlantic 10 cast them out, the Lions found their
“independent” status left them unable to put together a strong
schedule. ,

The slate included Buffalo, Morgan State, Butler (twice), Lafayette
and Maryland-Baltimore. As a result, the NCAA Tournament was not
really a realistic goal for head coach Bruce Parkhill.

“I felt, and I said so publicly, that as an independent, it wasn't a
good situation for us,” Parkhill said. “The chances of making the

NCAAs were pretty tough. ~

it, they earned their points. But they were

cutting it pretty close.”

Their loyal throng invaded Fitzgerald
Field House sporting T-shirts that read
“Thanks For The Memories,” but the Penn
State Nittany Lions weren’t finished until
they gave their faithful one more magical
performance.

The Nittany Lions snatched their 11th
consecutive Eastern Wrestling League
Tournament title and 14th overall in 17
years, while crushing the league's team
scoring mark -—— all in their final EWL
competition. Penn State was not ready to
bolt for the Big Ten until it racked up 165.5
points, surpassing its old mark of 148.25
back in 1987. Penn State sent seven of its
10 grapplers into the finals, and all seven
came away with titles. leading the way
was Tim Wittman, named the tourney’s
Outstanding Wrestler after a 6-4 overtime
upset of Pitt's Scott Hovan in the 158-
pound championship. Five of the seven
Penn State titles were decided in overtime
or by a one-point margin.

“They were favored in six of seven
weights, and they were really fortunate to
win that many," Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “When you think about

Four Pitt Panthers advanced to this
weekend’s National Tournament, which
will take place in Oklahoma City, Okla.
Senior All-Americans Hovan (158) and
Perry Miller (Heavyweight) and junior
Sean Gibbs placed second in their
respective weight classes, while
sophomore Jeff Kloiber (190) finished
third for the second straight year.

Pitt's 63 team points were only good
enough for fifth place, behind PSU, Lock
Haven (101.25), Clarion (89.5) and West
Virginia (66.25). Bloornsburg finished sixth,
followed by Cleveland State and Edinboro.
However the Panthers’ cause was greatly
damaged by a couple strokes of misfortune.
Bobby Simpson (1 18) did not even wrestle
in the tourney because he failed to make
weight, and a concussion forced Steve
Budman (142) to forfeit the competition
after his first—round match. The junior
tandem was expected to score big points,
with Simpson being one of the favorites at
his weight and Budman a strong contender
to place in the top four at his. Stottlemyer
said the Panthers’ big guns carried them
again, but the lack of production in other
classes thwarted Pitt

“The players had the NCAA as a long shot,” he said. “They were
hoping, but they had things in perspective.”
So Penn State will be competing in the NIT, which it has been in
twice before in the past four years. Last year the Lions made the field
of 64 teams in the NCAA Tournament.
While fans of both schools are getting excited about the renewal

See N11; page 16

“We did a good job. We ended up taking
four guys, andl thought coming in Simpson
and Budman could make it, too,”
Stottlemyer said. “U.Jl Fasnacht was awful
close, and U06] Plouse showed himself
real well, too. I hope the young guys
gained experience. You have to score in
all 10 weights, and we just didn’t get
enough points. There were four weights
where we didn’t score any points. The
horses obviously scored us points. We
were hoping to get some support from
some of the other guys.”

The two first—year prospects chipped in:
Fasnacht at 134 and Plouse at 150. Both
placed sixth, showing strong promise for
the future.

Hovan, the defending champ and top
seed at 158, marched to the finals by
pinning Bloornsburg’s Cory Anderson at
4:32 and scoring a 16-6 major decision
against Lock Haven’s Kemal Pegram in the
semifinals. Hovan defeated Wittman 8-2
during the dual-meet season, but Wittman
also won an EWL crown last year at 150, so
Hovan expected an intense matchup this

time.

“I ﬁgured it would be me and him
again," Hovan said.
Hovan displayed his trademark ferocity

Huskies
beat Lady
Panthers
in Big East
tourney

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

After ﬁnishing the regular
season with the upset of
Georgetown, the Pitt women's
basketball team entered the
Big East tournament seeded
seventh, hoping to turn some
heads.

They defeated No. 10
Boston College in the first
round, 70-59. But their rising
hopes deflated in the
quarterﬁnals, courtesy of host
Connecticut, 86-50. The
season-ending loss to the
Huskies closed out the Lady
Panthers’ year with a ﬁnal
mark of 11-18 overall, 6-12 in
the conference.

That record is not as bad as
it could have been, however,
when you consider that this
team lost three potential
starters before the season even
began. That left Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce with only
10 players on his roster when
everyone was healthy.

Lingering injuries to
forwards Turia Ransom and
Tiffany Fingers, as well as
guard Lisa Fessler, limited their
playing time during the year.’
Bruce often had only nine
players. In fact, Ransom did
not play in the last few games
of the year and did not get
any minutes in the
tournament.

by jumping on Wittman for a takedown in
the bout’s opening seven seconds.
However Wittman stunned Hovan by
quickly reversing him to knot the score 2-
2. For an instant Wittman had Hovan in
immediate danger. Even though Hovan
escaped the opening period with a 3~2
lead, he didn’t appear to wrestle with the
aggressiveness and wild—eyed nature that
he is known for during the remainder of
the bout.

“I felt like the biggest mistake I made in

the match was I should’ve given him two‘,-_

escapes instead of letting him get two
reversals."

The second reversal came in the early
stages of the second period, when Wittman
spun on top for a 4-3 lead, and an upset
was definitely in the making. Wittman
kept control until Hovan escaped with :25
remaining in the period to make it 4-4. It
stayed that way through the duration of
regulation time, with both wrestlers
appearing very cautious and getting
warned for stalling.

The extra period saw a quick rush of
action. Wittman shot at Hovan and looked

_ like he might end it until Hovan countered

with a move of his own. But out of this

Late bloomer Miller stalwart for wrestling team   

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer

The term “late-bloomer” does
not always denote positive
connotations for athletes.
Sometimes late-bloomers are
nothing more than people who
never fully develop.

Then there are those who defy
expectations and blossom into
superior performers, smashing
their supposed limitations. Pitt
wrestling head coach Rande
Stottlemyer has watched one of
these late-bloomers mature.

Pitt heavyweight Perry Miller
has ascended from virtual
obscurity to the threshold of a
national championship.

Miller, a senior All-American
from Delmont, Pa., enters this

_weekend’s NCAA Tournament
ranked fifth in the nation at
heavyweight,

He has racked up an impressive
25-2 slate, including a 16-1 dual-
meet record and an unblemished
Eastern Wrestling League mark
of 7-0.

Miller was named EWL Wrestler
of the Week for the week of Jan.
6.

Miller dominated opponents
during the dual-meet season, as
his 13 pins will attest. The only
losses came to Lehigh’s John
Morris (S-4) and recently to
Clarion’s Kurt Angle (3-2) in the
EWL Tournament Finals.
Finishing second at EWI.s did not
diminish the success Miller has
produced this season.

“Perry's had a tremendous
year,”Stott1emyersaid. “He’sbeen
so much more mature. Last year
he was still trying to find himself.
He’s a real special individual. As
a coach, you don’t get too many
like him.

“Coming from a 7-13 record as
a freshman — through hard work,
just that good old blue-collar
mentality—he’s anAll-American.
I just can’t say enough good
things about Perry Miller."

For someone who was not
expected to reach this level, Miller-
has come a long way. His
collegiate—career mark stands at

76—41—2.

Last season as a junior, Miller
went 23-10-1 en route to an
eighth-place finish and All-
American status at nationals.

He found himself one of only
five unseeded wrestlers in the
nation to gain the title of All-
American.

Over the summer Miller traveled
to Italy as part of the National
Wrestling Coaches Association
All-American team and gained
valuable international wrestling
experience by finishing second
in a tournament.

He also represented the East in
the U.S. Olympic Festival in Los
Angeles.

“I look from where Perry Miller
came from his freshman year at
EWLs, and through hard work
he’s developed into one of the
finest heavyweights in the
country, ” Lock Haven head coach
Carl Poff said. “It just goes to
show you that hard work pays off
because he took his lumps his
freshman year.”

Miller is a perfectionist who

\
, I
om-

always demands more from
himself. Academically, he
maintains a 2.98 grade—point
average in mechanical
engineering.

Miller carries himself in a quiet,
unassuming manner, and when
listening to him talk of his
accomplishments and
improvements, his modesty is
quite evident.

“Some of it is superstition. I
don't want it to jinx me,” Miller
said before EWLs. “I don’t know
why, but I’m superstitious, and
we have these two tournaments
coming up that really just decide
whether or not you have a good
season, "cause the dual-meets
don’t mean anything. Nobody
remembers how you did in the
dual-meet season. Everybody
remembers if you were a national
champ, an EWL champ, an All-
American.”

Although Miller fell just short in
his bid to unseat Angle as EWL
champion, he said he looks
forward to crossing Angle’s path
again this weekend.

Angle is a two—time All-

American and has been ranked _

No. 1 at heavyweight for the
entire season.

In 1990 Angle won the national _

championship, and he finished
second last year after taking a 2-
1 overtime decision from Miller in
the EWL ﬁnals. _

Miller said he approaches all
opponents with the same frame
of mind regardless of their ranking
or reputation and realizes that
everyone he faces in Oklahoma
City will provide a stiff test

“That's the thing about Perry. It
doesn’t matter who he’s
wrestling," Stottlemyer said. “If
It's the No. 1 guy, it's the No. 1; if
it's the 50th guy, it’s the 50th.
Perry says to himself, ‘I am going
to get the job done and let the
chips fall where they may.’ He’s

successful in a lot of different _

ways than Scott [I-Iovanl. He’s
very quiet and unassuming”.
Miller said he enjoys challenges,

but close matches are not always ‘

something he thrives on.

 Miller credited his father for

encouraging him to get involved

"in the Franklin junior Wrestling

‘Program in the Greensburg Salem

of wrestling saw him win at the
Greensburg Eliminations. He
advanced to the Area III
tournament, and after a victory
there he wrestled in a statewide
tourney in Altoona, where he

finished third.

Miller gradually became more
serious about wrestling and the
summer between his sophomore
and junior years at Greensburg
Salem High School completely
changed his outlook. He attended
an intense wrestling camp, where
for two weeks he did nothing but
wrestle, eat and sleep.

“You get up in the morning and
wrestle," he said. “Then you eat
lunch and, in the afternoon,
wrestle again. At night you come
back for another session. Then
you go to sleep. This went on for
two weeks, and boy, it was just

hell.”

This experience spurred a new
conditioning philosophy for
Miller. S

“Conditioning is something you
can control; it doesn't depend on
natural ability,” Miller said. “You
can't control your natural ability,
but this is somethingl can control.
In 11th grade I lost to a kid
because he was in better shape,
and I said never again.”

From that point on Miller

implemented a tremendous ,

training regimen that includes a
lot of running and weightlifting.

occasional rest.

“I' take a Sunday off every now
and then,” he said. “I go for a
short, fast run— about two miles.”

“One thing about Perry: He
knows conditioning is one thing
you can control -'-— conditioning
and attitude,” Stottlemyer said.
“Perry's thorough. He is a real
analytical. guy, and he’s real
thorough with his conditioning."

Miller’s commitment to
preparation has paid large
dividends. He came to Pitt as a
natural 190—pounder and
developed himself into a true
heavyweight during his redshirt
season of 1989-90.

This training philosophy Miller
calls the “Iowa Philosophy”
because Iowa’s wrestlers, under
head coach Dan Gable, have
traditionally been in better shape
than the opposition.

“It really can be anyone’s

philosophy; it’s just that Iowa has
been known for it,” Miller said.
“’Ihey’re looked at as the best.
They’ve made it famous. Your
opponent —— run him into the
dirt, just don’t beat him.”

Miller has no problem
motivating himself and
appreciates the loyal support of
his parents, who attend every
home match and have even
traveled to many of the away
matches, including gping to
Clemson this season. His mother,
Carol, sang the national anthem
before many of Pitt’s dual—meets
at Fitzgerald Field House and
before the ﬁnals of the EWL
Tournament.

Miller was virtually unknown
on the national scene before his
junior season, but people
gradually started to notice him.
After his performance at nationals,
Miller was forced to accept his
new role as a “favorite,” staying
in the top six nationally
throughout this season.

“I have more conﬁdence. I
know that the guys I'm going to

    
  

/’

    

W

  

  

wrestle are looking to get a big
upset for themselves, ” Miller said.
“I don’t want to sound arrogant
when I say that. It’s added
pressure on me ‘cause it makes
every match that muchharder.
They all want to bump you off,
whereas last year nobody knew
this Miller kid from pm."

Unfortunately the satisfaction
of an opening. round win at
NCAAs was short-lived; Miller met
up with North Carolina State’s
Sylvester Terkay. in the second
round, and Terkay pinned him.
With Miller being a probable fifth
or sixth seed this year, he will not
meet up with any of the other top

' contenders early and should use
the experience of ‘last year’s loss
in Iowa to his‘ beneﬁt, should he
see T erkay again.

Miller explained that Terkay is
a tough matchup because of his
height. Miller stands about 6-feet,
S—inches and is accustomed to
wrestling opponents that are
much shorter.

But Terkay is taller than Miller,
and this presented problems that
he could not adjust to. After the
loss, Miller fought his way through
the consolation bracket and
wound up winning four of the
seven matches he wrestled at
nationals.

Besides Angle and Terkay,
other competition will come from
Kirk Mammen of Oklahoma State
(third seed) and Mike Anderson
of Arizona State (fourth seed).

As heapproaches the climax of
his collegiate career, Miller admits
that the pressure has been getting
to him. This year big things are
expected. Part of him will be
relieved when nationals are over.

“I know I'm gonna miss it, but
at the same time I’m getting kind
of tired,” he said.

Miller said he has been growing
more anxious as the days pass
and he wants the national
championship “more than
anything.”

“It’s been a dream of mine ever
since I knew what it meant. Back
in junior high it sank in, what it
meant to be a national champion,”
he said. “It was a distant dream,’
but now it’s more vivid. I

“I have to wrestle this

tournament in each match like it 4,,

Continued from page 12
tussle, Wittman scored the
decisive takedown and ended
Hovan’s quest for a second
consecutive EWL crown. Hovan
said he never felt any sense that
the match was slipping away and

V cou1dn’t decipher what exactly

happened on the last exchange
of the bout.

“I felt pretty conﬁdent that he
couldn’t take me down,” he said.
“I don't know who shot at who.

. We got into a ﬂurry, and he got on

top.

Hovan became only the 23rd
wrestler in league history to
qualify for the NCAAs four times.
He placed second at 150 in 1988,
third at 150 in 1989 and, following
his redshirt season, won the 158-
pound title last season. Carrying a
27-4 record and a probable ﬁfth
seed for nationals, Hovan
-accepted the loss. Ever the
competitor, he vowed to redeem
himself.

“He wrestled a helluva match;
it deﬁnitely hurts to lose," Hovan
said. “I’m not gonna let it get me
down. Losing makes you humble
and makes you hungry.”

r Despite being a definite
underdog, Gibbs appeared to
control Penn State’s Dave Hart for
the majority of their duel in the
167-pound finals, but a referee’s
controversial decision may have
taken the title from Gibbs’ grasp.
Late in the third period Gibbs led,
3-2.

With only four seconds
remaining in the bout, the referee‘
called Gibbs for stalling and
awarded a point to Hart. The
match went to overtime, with
Hart prevailing 5-3. Gibbs was on
a mission throughout the
tournament, striving for the
respect a 23-5 season merited.
The most severe blemish on his

, slate was a 9-1 loss to Hart, and r

Gibbs was out to prove that a
fluke. After the finals Gibbs
intently focused on his
accomplishment and reﬂected on
the questionable decision. _

“Sometimes that’s the way it
goes, ” Gibbs said. “I know now at
nationals he’s gonna think twice
about me. I’m not a 9-1 opponent.
I think he has a helluva lot more
respect for me now. Deep down
inside he knows that I won.

“I’m happy that I'm going to
nationals. If I place higher than
him at nationals, nobody will
remember him beating me here.
Everybody that was here, except
for Penn State people, know what
happened. I'm not taking anything
away from him; hejs a helluva
good wrestler. But I think tonight
I got the best of him."

Gibbs earned his trip to the

,, final, completely controlling

Bloomsburg’s Brian Willoughby
in a 14-8 decision, then surviving
third-seeded Ron Coffel of Lock
Haven, 6-5. He takes a 25-6 mark
to nationals. '

Miller and Clarion’s Kurt Angle .

staged a sequel to 1991's titanic

" Heavyweight ﬁnal, with Angle

earning a tough, 5-2 decision.

Last year Angle won 2-1 in
overtime. In that bout, neither
man could score even a takedown.
This time Angle ﬁred out to an
early 2-0 lead with a takedown
:15 in that Miller said he thought
was the difference.

“The coaches told me he’s
gonna come out strong and hard
and go for that ﬁrst takedown.
Maybe I should’ve listened a little
better," he said.

There were three other
moments in this bout when Angle
shot and controlled Miller in a
single-leg hold, only to see Miller's
extraordinary balance and
strength bail him out of trouble.
Miller said he should have seized
these opportunities to counter
with a takedown of his own.

“As soon as [Angle] released
the leg, I should’ve dropped down
and shot,” Miller said. “He was a
real small target, andl just gotta
find a way to take him down.”

Miller trailedi2-1 at the outset
of the second period, and a quick
escape by Angle made it 3-1.
Miller closed the gap to 3-2 with
an escape to start the ﬁnal period
and came at Angle hard
throughout the ﬁnal two minutes,
falling just short with his last-
second shot.

Miller said his neglect in
developing an outside shot hurt

him in this bout. Most of his shots
are straight on, and with Angle
being such a small target an
outside shot could make a
significant difference if the two
meet this weekend.

Kloiber battled his way through
the consolation bracket to take
third from Bloornsburg’s Tyrone
Howard. After winning a 15-5
ﬁrst—round major decision over
Cleveland State ’s Dennis Marconi,
Kloiber locked up‘ with Penn
State '3 Adam Mariano in the semis.
The first 20 seconds proved fatal
to Kloiber, with Mariano catching
him for a five—point move.
Mariano led 7-2 after the ﬁrst
period, but after an even second
period Kloiber made a strong

_ charge.

He immediately escaped from
the bottom position to start the
third period, then took Mariano
down to close the gap to 8-5.
However Mariano held on for a
9-5 decision. 9

happen," Kloiber said. “I made
one mistake against Mariano, and
that ﬁve-point move made the
difference.”

Kloiber came out with ﬁre
against Edinboro’s Jason
Loukides, winning a '5-2 ‘decision
in the consolation semifinals. I _

Howard looked very strong in
his semiﬁnal bout against Lock
Haven’s Dale Budd, the top seed.
Kloiber jumped on him early,
-and‘ a‘ takedown 1:15 into the
bout gave Kloiber a 2-0 lead. He
escaped from the bottom position
for a 3-1 lead early in the second
period, but Howard wrestled hard
throughout. Kloiber’s riding time
advantage pushed the ﬁnal score
to 4-2. Kloiber (16-8-3) has
advanced to NCAAs in his ﬁrst
two seasons, but he said he is
looking for more than just
experience this time.

“If I'm an All-American this
year, nobody’s gonna remember
I placed third at EWLs. They're
just gonna remember I was an
All-American," Kloiber said. “I
only made one mistake. I still feel

on any given day I could have
won this. The top threefguys in
this weight are all equal, and any
one of us could have won it.

By no means is Kloiber in awe
of the challenge that awaits him
at Oklahoma City. ,

“I feel pretty conﬁdent I'll do

well at nationals,’.' he said.’

“Marianofsi a pretty high-class

, wrestler; he beat the No. 1 guy in
. the country [Travis Fiser of Iowa,

6-4]. I just have to stay focused. If
I'm on at the national tournament,

I could win the whole tournament

I don't think I’m in that second
echelon. I think I'm in that upper
echelon of _ wrestlers when I'm
on."

Stottlemyer said he expects all
four of his wrestlers to perform
well at nationals. Hovan is making
his fourth appearance. Miller and
Kloiber are making their second,
while Gibbs will be making his
NCAA debut.

“We're taking out four kids that
are going to compete. We're not
just going to get experience,"
Stottlemyer said.

Bruce tried to make the best out
of a tough situation.

“We just tried to adjust and do

things would have been better if
we’d have had this player or

play with the ones you have and

The Lady Panthers entered

before going on a 31-8 run to
take control of the contest.

In the first round of the
tournament, Pitt continued the
run of success it started against
the Hoyas by dominating Boston

by as many as 22 before the
halftime buzzer sounded with
the Lady Panthers ahead by a

Continued from page 12
of a classic rivalry, Parkhill said
his players are not affected to the
same degree.

“I think the main thing was to
play a team of that stature, whether
it be Pitt, Villanova or Florida,” he
said. “Our guys haven’t been
touched that much by the rivalry.”

The Nittany Lions are paced by
their senior backcourt of Monroe
Brown and Freddie Barnes.
Barnes, the point guard, averages
13.3 points and 6.2 assists a game.
Brown is the team’s leading scorer
at 14.8 points per game, and both
players are the only legitimate
three—point shooters.

The frontcourt is not as steady
and has been injury-prone. The
Penn State frontline is not big to
begin with, and the biggest
regular, 6-foot, 9-inch David
Degitz, has been bothered by a
recurring back injury. Parkhill
described Degitz’s status as “day-
to-day," but added that Degitz
will play tonight. 0

Degitz is joined up front by
sophomore Eric Carr and
swingman DeRon Hayes, the
squad’s third-leading scorer (13.1
points per game).

Both Carr and Hayes are 6-6,
and Degitz is the leading
rebounder with a 5.1 boards-per-
game average.

“Pitt will be tough to play
because they are so big inside
and it's tough to match up,"

Parkhill said. "We only have one‘

big guy [Degitzl.‘”
To make up for the lack of big

 

filled bag of trick shots.

men, nearly all the regular players
hit the boards frequently. Brown
is the third-leading rebounder
from his off—guard position, and
Barnes also averages over four
boards a game.

First-year player Matt Gaudio is
the top reserve, averaging 8.9
points a game, but he too is
limited by back problems. Beyond
Gaudio, the Lions’ bench is thin.

Still, Penn State has been
successful during recent times, as
its 87-39 record in the past four
years demonstrates. This year was
PSU’s fourth straight 20-win
season.

The Lions have won 40 of their

last 42 at home in Rec Hall, A

including 14 in a row this year.
However Parkhi1l’s team has had
a two—and-a-half week layoff since
its last game, a 79-75 win over
American on March 2.

“Things have been going pretty
well,” Parkhill said. “There’s no
getting around a layoff like that.
We gave them some time off,
though.” ,

Although the Pitt team might
be unfamiliar to the Nittany Lions,
the court won't. The game will be
held at Penn State's Rec Hall,
which gives the Lions a huge
advantage.

“It's a relief for the players,”
Parkhill said. “There’s no question
that everybody plays better at
home, and we’ve had something
like 16 road games this year."

In addition, Parkhill said he is
very familiar with his counterpart,
Pitt head coach Paul Evans. The
two faced each other when Evans
was at Navy and Parkhill was at
William and Mary, and twice
when Parkhill took over the Penn
State position.

Looking at the game, the Penn
State coach said he sees Panther
guard Sean Miller as a key to Pitt’s
game.

“I’m really impressed with
Miller,” he said. “He’s just" a
fabulous passer, both in the open
floor and into the post, and [he]
can obviously shoot.”

Although Pitt fans may be I

disappointed with an NIT bid,‘

Parkhill sees it as valuable.
“It’s a situation that enables the

guys to play some more,-

especially our seniors, and have
fun," he said. “We really enjoyed
the NIT in our previous
experiences."

The tip-off is set for 9:30 p.m.
and will be televised nationally
by ESPN. The second-round
matchups will be announced after
the first-round games are
completed.

throws by Fingers and Erin
Maloy put the game out of
reach.

“We felt like it was the kind
of game where we had to play
well,” Bruce said. “We changed
our defense a bit, going away
from our man-to—man into a
zone. It worked because we
limited their good shots and
outrebounded them by 14.”

They also shot the ball better
than they did in their past two
games, making 53 percent of
their shots for the game,
including 14 out of 25 in the
first half.What little momentum
Pitt had built to that point hit a
Husky brick wall in the next
round. The Lady Panthers
allowed UConn to jump out to
a 23-2 lead in the first 7:30.
The game was over at halftime,
as the Huskies led by 30, 48-
18. As was the case in the
earlier debacle at Connecticut,
Pitt made only one—quarter of
its shots, hitting on seven of 29
first-half attempts for a 24.1"-

The second half seemed a
little better for the Lady
Panthers, as they kept the score
closer by holding the Huskies
to 38 points and scoring 32.

“We started out really
nervous and didn't get off to a
good start,” Bruce said. “They
came out hot, and we got
down by 12. Then we had to
try and press, but that really
didn’t work too well and we
were out of it by halftime.

“In the second half, we told
them to forget about the first
half and to just go out and
play.”

Despite the lopsided score,
Bruce managed to see the
bright side of an otherwise
dark loss.

“Our kids never quit,” he
said. “Even when they got
down big early, they were still
trying. We’d like to try and
build on the effort they put out
in the second half next year.
We were different than a lot of
other schools because we
didn't really want the season
to end.”

Georgetown tough for 30 minutes
before succumbing and went
home having gained some respect
from conference opponents and
fans.However if Pitt entered the
tournament with a dark cloud
hovering overhead, it left in the
midst of a hurricane.

Fans began to question the
team’s spirit and Evans’ coaching
ability. Then the team voted to
reject a bid to the National
Invitational Tournament. After
they were _overruled and the
pairings came out, Pitt was the
only Big East school to..open the
NIT on the road — at arch—rival
Penn State, where the Nittany
Lions have won 14 in a row.

That's not too hard to figure out
— the NIT wants to make money.
Penn /State likes to play in the
NIT, and Pitt thinks that it is like
being deemed a second—class

citizen. The grumbling from fans
and boosters had to lead the NIT
to question whether Pitt could
even sell out 6,798 Fitzgerald
Field House seats, let alone 16,500
in the Civic Arena.While many
fans look on the NIT as a slap in
the face, look at the expectations
of this team before the year
started. Many fans were praying
for an NIT berth. After a few early
wins, including one on the road
at Kentucky, many had visions of
the Big Dance in their heads.
These dreams grew even bigger
after a 3-0 start in conference
play put Pitt into ﬁrst with its best
Big East start ever. Then the
Panthers lost four in a row, and
reality hit home. Hopes were
climbing back up when a 20-
point loss to Boston College put
a permanent damper on
enthusiasm. The only wins they
could muster were at home

against Villanova, a’ slumping  I

Connecticut squad and Boston
College in Sean Miller and Darren
Morningstar’s last home game’;
So before cursing Evans and
his staff and comparing them to
the coaching staff of the
Sacramento Kings, look at what

they really had to work with '—.,a '

raw group of talented basketball
players with a lot of rough edges.

Evans’ contract was extended
by Athletic Director Oval Jaynes.
While the exact terms and
provisions were not released, one
of them probably has to do with
this new group of recruits. If
Evans can show signs , of
improvement and even make it
past the second round of the
NCAAs while running a clean‘
program, expect

extension. If not, there could be_
a coaching vacancy at a
semiprivate, urban school.
