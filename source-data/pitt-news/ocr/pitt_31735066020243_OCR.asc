A man fitting the description of
a suspect wanted for a rape in
south Oakland 10 days ago was
chased by city and campus police
yesterday after he broke into
another apartment within a block
of the earlier attack.

The man, described as a 15- to
19-year-old black male "with a
dark complexion, was discovered

early yesterday in the bed of a fe-
male Pitt student in the 200 block
of Atwood Street.

When the girl returned at 10
a.m. yesterday and found that her
apartment had been ransacked,
she left to get her boyfriend. A
video cassette -recorder, later re-

was missing, and a butcher's

The woman's underwear were

in victory over Bob Edgar

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA —- Republican U.S. Sen.
Arlen Specter, re-elected to a second term,
credited his victory to hard work and a record
‘for independence.

”It was approval by the people of Pennsyl-
vania for the job "I've done in office,” Specter
said Tuesday night after his victory speech.

”I want to thank the people of Pennsylvania

,3: for the expression of confidence and for send-
’ ' ing me back to the U.S. Senate for a second



\ .

term,” Specter said.

His second term agenda includes measures
to spur the economic recovery to‘ pockets of
the state, but Specter said he would resist vot-
ing strictly for the wishes of the Reagan ad
ministration. '

”There is no expectation by the party that
I would do anything other than vote my con-
science,” Specter said.

A former district attorney in Philadelphia, the
56-year-old Specter was greeted by chants of
”Ar-len, Ar-len” and ”Six More Years" at his
victory party. Supporters strutted to a string
band and rock quartet during ‘the festivities.

"Considering the alternative, it's ‘better to
win,” said Specter, a three-time loser in

statewide elections before he defeated former
Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty in a senate race
six years ago. .

Aides credited Specter’s win over Democrat
Bob Edgar tohis unending toils.

"It was good, old-fashioned hard work. Arlen
is a hard working, populist sort'of senator,” said
Gordon Wood row, Specter’s campaign
manager.

”He’s dogged and persistent. He's legend for
his hard work. He really produced. He built

up a lot of chits over the yearswith business— _

men and unions_a|ike," said Dan McI_<enna,
Specter’s spokesman’. ' '

'’I don't think Edgar had an issue. Edgar was
never able to erode Arlen’s image, which he
had built up over six years, being visible and
accessible. He was always on the road,”
M_cKenna said.

The race lacked much suspense because
Specter had maintained a double-digit lead
over Edgar in public opinion polls.

Casey sa vors victory

By Peter Mattiace
Associated Press Writer

SCRANTON, Pa. —— Amid the red, white and
blue hoop-la of the sweetest of victories, the
real Bob Casey today remembered that real
success sometimes takes four times.

After failure in 1966, 1970 and 1978, Robert
Patrick Casey, at 54 years of age, finally won
his prize as governor of Pennsylvania.

1 "Tonight’s victory,” Casey said with a know-
ing smile, "is a victory for all those good peo-

ple around this Commonwealth who’. were "

down, who refused to quit and who got back
up again  and kept fighting.”

For more than 1,000 of the faithful awaiting
Tuesday's election results at a Scranton hotel,
Casey's smiles and waves ended a four-hour
vigil of optimism, then foreboding and, sud-
denly, success.

Only two hours earlier, a late surge by
Republican Lt. Gov. William W. Scranton III,
and a report that Casey had not carried

‘Philadelphia by as wide a margin as expect-

ed, put the fear of still another failure into the
crowd. V .

But Casey's runningmate for- lieutenant
governor, state Sen. Mark Singel, D-Cambria,
sensed a victory earlier than most.

Before the polls closed, Singel predicted’
’”flat-out it's a win.”

Later, a more subdued Singel nervously con-
ceded, ”No question about it, it's going to be
close. I was wrong about the margin.”

John Davies, 32, of Carbondale, a Democrat-
ic volunteer, .worried about the Philadelphia

numbers despite ”a real good showing here in _

Lackawanna County.”

Davies, who described himself as "an unem-
ployed government worker,” hoped a new
Casey administration might mean work for him
in Harrisburg. -

"I’d entertain an offer if it came my way,”
Davies said. . \

Former Philadelphia District Attorney Ed
Rendell, Casey's opponent turned campaign
chairman, conceded Casey's camp was "op-
timistically nervous."

Casey, in two terms as audito_r general,
gained popularity as a reform—minded state
official.

Two other Robert Caseys subsequently won

- statewide elections — one as state Treasurer

and one as a lieutenant governor nominee in
the 1978 Democratic primary that Caseylost

to former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty.

SGB presidential candidates discusscampus issues

‘9:

By Teresa Candori
Assistant News “Editor

Divestment, public safety, and the
student activites fee were the major
4 issues in last night's debate between
Student Government Board presiden-
tial candidates Phil Moyer and Jay
Rothstein.

The debate, attended by an au-
dience of 30, was monitored by out-
going SGB president Jim Mumma
and broadcast live on WPTS. The
candidates’ main focus was the board

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 

 lay Roth ei

 

of trustees’ recent de_cision to con-
tinue adherence to the Sullivan Prin-
ciples andthe surge of.violent crime
in Oakland. I

While both Moyer and Rothstein ‘

considered the board of trustees’ po-
sition on divestment too weak, the
two disagreed on the role of student
opinion in the trustees’ decision. '
"Through more quorums and more
education of the student masses, and
then a referendum, we could present
a more educated opinion of the stu-
dents and a stronger voice for the stu-
dent population,” Moyer said.
Rothstein considered the referen-
dum something to look forward to,
but felt it would have little impact.
"A lot of people are calling for a
binding referendum...I don't know
how representative it would be of the
student population,” Rothstein said.
”I think a major percentage of.the stu-
dents wouldn't vote. I don't know
how significant that would be.”
Moyer. replied that the students
who wouldn't vote in a referendum
most likely are not concerned with
the issue of divestment. ,
"We need to voice the opinions of

. those students who do care," Moyer
‘said. "|t’s\our responsibilityto voice -
student concerns ‘to. thepbqard _'’.Of_, ,

dorngot know abo_ut[the problem] 

  

trustees, and if we don't even ask
those students who care, then we're
shutting out part of our’population.
That's something that can't be done
on student government.”

Rothstein clarified, "I'm not saying

I don't want to represent the students’
view; I'm saying I don't know how
representative [a referendum] would
be to the board of trustees. I don't
think they would actually look at it
seriously.” '

Onthe issue of public safety, Moy-
er and Rothestein agreed that pro-
grams to increase student awareness
would be effective in reducing vio-
lent crime.

”A lot of people think there should
be more police protection, especial-
ly since there's been a spree of murd-

ers and rapes here in Oakland,” ‘

Rothstein said. ”What I think needs
to be done, instead, is for the student
government to hold some- sort of
seminars to increase student aware-
ness as to how to protect themselves,
how to stay out ofsituations’ that
would provoke an assault or a rape."

Moyer contended that part of the
problem is the high percentage of
crimes that go unreported.

"The city and the universityrreally

 

cause we haven't been telling them,”
he said. "That’s why there's been a

_lack of police protection.”

The candidates also agreed on
another potentially controversial is-
sue, an increase in the student activi-
ties fee. However, the two disagreed
on the implimentation of the in-
crease.

- ”Back in 1975, IUP had a student
activities fee of $65," Moyer said.
"Presently we are operating on a stu-
dent activities fee of $35, I really
don't feel that's adequate of a univer-
sity of this size.”‘ .

Moyer cited last year's record re-
quests for allocations, totalling
$9b0,000 and pointed out, "Inflation
has risen, but the student activities fee
hasnft.”

Rothstein acknowledged the need
for an increase in the activities fee,‘
but disputed the validity of Moyer's
contrast of Pitt and IUP.

"I don't think it's fair to compare
this university to any other [in terms
of] the amount of the student activi-
ties fee,” Rothstein said. ”One, be-
cause of the population of the
university, and two, because some
other schools incorporate the student
activities fee more and some incor-

porate it less." ‘ _ 6 -

Moyer pointed out that the present ~ ,

SGB had considered the increase.
"lt’s not a very difficult issue to ad-
dress. Ten or. fifteen dollars would be
more than adequate to cover the
needs of -the students,” he said.
Rothstein argued, "I don't think a
monetary figure can be put on how
much It should. be raised at this time,

because if it were five or ten dollars v '
" now, in two or three years they'll be-

asking for more again. I think it's
something that, if changed, shouldn't
have to be changed again for a
while." .~

U.S. envoy arrested and expelled by Iranians 

NICOSIA, Cyprus — The speaker
of Iran's Parliament said yesterday
that his government arrested and then
expelled a special envoy sent to Iran
by President Reagan, the official Ira-
nian news agency reported.

The Islamic Republic News Agen-
cy identified the special envoy as
former National Security Adviser
Robert McFar|ane. The agency did
not specify when the reported expul-
sion took place.

At McFar|ane’s office at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington, an aide said the for-
mer White House official had no
comment on the subject.

There were published reports in the
Middle East that American hostage
David Jacobsen was freed Sunday as
a result of negotiations between the
United States and Iran.

Asked about a possible role by Syr-
ia or Iran in the release of hostages,
Terry Waite told a news conference,
”I don't want to comment on the po-
litical dynamics.” Waite, the Angli-
can Church envoy who has worked

to gain the freedom of hostages held I

in Lebanon, spoke at a news confer-
ence in Wiesbaden, West Germany.

Waite said he expected to hear
from his contacts within 24 hours
whether he will be returning to Beirut
to negotiate the release of more
Western hostages. He said there are

High court deals

blow to anti-abortion

WASHINGTON — States may not
cut off payments to private groups be-
cause the groups offer, among other
things, abortions or abortion counsel-
ing, the Supreme Court ruled
Monday.

By a 5-3 vote, the court upheld rul-
ings that Arizona's payment policy
violated the constitutional rights of
Planned Parenthood organizations in
the state.

Although today’s decision was not
accompanied by any written opin-
ions, it sets a national precedent.
Without waiting to conduct oral ar-
guments in the case, the court af-
firmed that such state-fund cutoffs
interfere with constitutionally protect-
ed abortion rights.

ChiefJustice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Byron R. White and An-
tonin Scalia voted to hear arguments
in the abortion case, but four votes
are needed to grant such review.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not

.participate.

It

The high court nine years ago said
states have no legal obligation to pay
for ”non-therapeutic” abortions. Six
years ago the justices went further,
ruling that the federal government
and individual states do not have to
fund even the most therapeutic
abortions.

Shultz in Vienna to
rejuvenate arms talks

WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George Shultz and senior ad-
visers traveled to Vienna yesterday to
try to regain the arms control momen-
tum that stalled in Iceland, unsure of
what reception to expect from their
Soviet counterparts.

To bridge the gap between the two
sides, a U.S. proposal for a treaty to
cut superpower strategic arsenals in
half by 1991 has been modified since
the summit in Reykjavik to allow the
Soviets to retain more land-based
missile warheads, an administration
official said Monday.

Shultz is scheduled to hold talks
late tonight with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at
the U.S. Embassy in the Austrian cap-
ital. They will hold a second round
Thursday morning at the Soviet
Embassy. '

Woman pleads guilty

to treason in Pretoria

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
A 28-year-old white woman today
pleaded guilty to treason, admitting
she planted bombs at two police sta-
tions and was a guerrilla for the out-
lawed African National Congress.

Marion Sparg’s guilty plea was ac-
cepted in Johannesburg’s provincial
Supreme Court, and sentencing is ex-
pected this week. She could receive
the death sentence.

Sparg, a former reporter whose
family is from the Indian Ocean port
city of East London, said she also
bombed three offices of the liberal
opposition Progressive Federal Party
in 1981.

In an emotional letter written just
before her March arrest and read to
the court, she pleaded for her parent's
understanding. What she called ”the
war for freedom” would be bitter, she
said, but ”in the end there will be a
happier life for us all — black and
white.”

WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP)
—— U.S. Air Force doctors examining
David Jacobsen said the former
hostage toasted his freedom with
wine and appears to have endured 17
months of captivity in Lebanon
remarkably well.

Jacobsen, 55, was awaiting a reun-
ion today with his three children,
Eric, Paul and Diane. He arrived at
theU.S. military base in Wiesbaden
on Monday, one day after being freed
in the Lebanese capital of Beirut by
his Shiite Moslem captors.

Following a preliminary medical
examination, Wiesbaden Air Force

hospital chief Col. Charles K. Maffet.

said that "although he [Jacobsen] is
tired, our initial impression is that he
is physically in very good condition.

”|t also seems that he has dealt

with the stresses of his captivity ~

remarkably well," Maffet added.

Jacobsen was administrator of the
American University Hospital in
Beirut when he was abducted May
28, 1985, by the pro-Iranian Islamic
Jihad organization, which holds at
least two other Americans hostage.

”|nitial evaluation did not reveal
any evidence of physical abuse,” said
Maffet, adding that Jacobsen was eat-
ing normally and drank some wine
to celebrate his freedom.

He said the medical evaluation
would be completed in a few days.

Jacobsen’s children and their
spouses left their homes in California
on Monday to meet with State
Department officialsin Washington
before continuing on to West
Germany.

Air-Force spokesmen said they did

Jacobsen physically fitdespite17-

not know when Jacobsen, a native of

Huntington Beach, Calif., would be

returning to the United States.

In an emotional statement to
reporters after his arrival here,‘ the
former hostage pleaded for the
release of other Western captives in
Lebanon.

’'I can't tell you how very, very
happy I am here today. But it's with
really mixed feelings to be a free man
again,” he said with a shaky voice,
appearing on the verge of tears.

Six Americans and 13 other for-
eigners remain missing in Lebanon,
including Terry A. Anderson, 39,
chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, and Thomas
Sutherland, 55, acting dean of
agriculture at the American Univer-
sity in Beirut.

"Those guys are in hell, and we've =

gotta get them_ home,” Jacobsen said.

Anderson and Sutherland were kid-
napped by the Islamic Jihad in early
1985.

Anglican Church envoy Terry
Waite, 47, who has worked toward
freeing the hostages since last year,
surfaced in Lebanon three days be-
fore Jacobsen’s release and accompa-
nied the former captive to
Wiesbaden. '

During a brief stop at Larnaca,

Cyprus, Waite said he would con- -

tinue his efforts for the other hostages
and may be returning soon to
Lebanon.

”We’re being very careful about
what we say for the moment because
we're just at a very critical stage,” he
said. ”I’|| be here probably for a cou-
ple of days, and then I may be going
back.” I

Most women passed on birth control

By Randolph E. Schmid

Associated Press Writer

Fewer than half the women in a

. new government study said they used

contraception when they first en-
gaged in sexual intercourse.

The study by the National Center
for Health Statistics said 45 percent
of women between the ages of 15
and 44 reported they had used some
form of contraception during their
-first intercourse.

”Data like these are important be-
cause most women have intercourse
before marriage, exposing them-
selves to the risk of unplanned, pre-
marital pregnancy if they delay
contraceptive use,” the report said.

An earlier report, published a year
ago by the same agency, found that
about two-thirds of women aged 15
to 44 who had ever been married had
had sexual intercourse before
marriage.

Contraceptive use varied consider-
ably according to race, income and
age, according to the study based on
interviews conducted with more than

_7,000 women in 1982.

The National Survey of Family
Growth found that 47 percent of
white women reported using con-
traception at first ‘intercourse, while
34 percent of black women and only
25 percent of Hispanic women did
so.

The proportion using contraception

at first intercourse was twice as high
for women with 13 yearsvor more of

education than for women with less ‘

than 12 years of schooling — 54 per-
cent to 26 percent. V

Women with family incomes three
or more times the poverty level used
contraception in 51 percent of their
first encounters, while the rate was
34 percent for women with incomes
of.1.5 or less times the poverty lev-
el, the report said. ‘

Women delaying their first inter-
course until age 18 or over used con-
traception 48 percent of the time,
compared to 41 percent for those
who began earlier.

Younger women who had experi-
enced their first intercourse more re-
cently were found to be more likely

to use contraceptives, indicating that
usagehas increased in recent years,
the report said.

For example, 48 percent of wom-
en aged 15 to 19 said they used con-
traception at first intercourse, while
those aged 35 to 44_did so in 40 per-
cent of the cases.

The most common contraceptive
method reported for first experiences
was the condom, listed by 39 percent
of women.

Twenty-eight percent said they
used the pill, and 19 percent tried
withdrawal. The remainder used a
variety of other methods, such as
lUDs, diaphragms and sterilization.

an element in the decision by the ls- ‘

ThePitt News

strongly endorses
Phil Moyer

for president

Therese McFadden
Roan Confer
for the SGB

It's that time of the year again. Student government elections start
today and end tomorrow. Make sure you cast your vote to let your
voice be heard.

After some debate, The Pitt News editorial board has come up with .

their list of endorsed candidates for the Student Government Board
and presidency.

For the position of SGB president, The Pitt News endorses Phil Moy—
er. Moyer brings a realistic approach to the position. He readilygad-
mits that, while divestment is a high-priority issue, security on campus
affects us on a more personal level and is, therefore, more pressing.

For the Student Government Board, The Pitt News endorses Therese
McFadden and Roan Confer. Of the 1 1 board candidates, these two
have proved themselves to be most voteworthy. Neither of them filled
his or her platform with tired rhetoric about increasing communica-
tion and decreasing apathy. ‘

Confer realizes the limitations of a position on the SGB and, there-
fore shies away from promising things he cannot do. He readily ad-
mits that the SGB can ”influence, lead and educate. And they can
make recommendations.” He honestly believes that the SGB cannot

_ and should not make promises that are not within their realm.

McFadden has much the same attitude when it comes to making
promises about issues which cannot be solved. Her idea to use the
SGB as a lobbying organization to work on statewide issues, though
not a new one, is commendable. Her mention of House Bill No. 6
as a way to pressure Pitt into divestment shows her awareness of the
SGB’s role both on and off campus.

Also endorsed are: Fiora Boehm, Amy Danziger, Rose Cardone,
Vince Altomare, George Kontos and Kelly McQuoid.

ﬁﬁﬁfrﬂr

Remember *
to vote today

Every year, a select group of people actually get excited about SGB
elections. It's usually just the candidates and their friends though.
That's most likely the reason that SGB elections are regarded as little
more than a popularitycontest by many of the students at Pitt.

The truth of the matter. is that the SGB has the potential to be more
than it's been in the past. If more people were involved, it would
be a much more effective organization. ‘

You don't necessarily have to apply for positions on committees

‘ or run for office. All you'h_ave to do is vote. It really does matter.

SDI: the crucial allacy

As everyone knows, the United
States and the'5oviet Union possess
enormous stockpiles of thermo-
nuclear warheads. The two countries
are, speaking figuratively, armed
with nuclear ”swords. ” The construc-
tion of an anti-missile defense system

« would mean adding a ’’shield’’ to the

”sword. ” I think that such an expan-
sion of the nuclearmissile armament
would be very dangerous.

— Andrei Sakharov

We have been through the Star
Wars debate before, and Sakharov’s
words, which were true. then, are still
true now. Unfortunately, Star Wars
supporters have ignored the past de-
bate and want to start back at the be-
ginning again. So be it; we will have
to rehearse the moves with them
once again. '

It seems that they have finally come
around to admitting that Star Wars
could never work as an umbrella to
protect populations. However, rather
than concede defeat and junk their
precious scheme, they have come up
with even more absurd rationales for
placing weapons of mass destruction
in space. Now, for example, they

maintain that the point of Star Wars .

is not to defend us against weapons

that have already been fired; rather,_

the point is, supposedly, to banish
nuclear weapons altogether. SDI, we
are told in pious tones, will bring
about a world free of nuclear
weapons because it makes them ef-
fectively useless. In one particularly
naive version, we are told that the
Soviets will spontaneously see how
silly it is to maintain all those awful-
ly expensive warheads once Uncle
Ron has erected his peace shield.

This line of reasoning — now one
of the central arguments given in
favor of Star Wars — ‘reveals a dan-
gerous ignorance of the strategic real-
ities. For if an effective Star Wars
”defense” system were ever
deployed, the result would be a mas-
sive escalation of the offensive arms
race.

To see why, imagine yourself in
Soviet shoes for a moment. The
Americans — who you have no rea-
son to believe have benign intentions
.— have deployed a missile defense.
Unfortunately, your space defense
technology is not as good as theirs.

Suddenly your position is very seri-
ous. Now the Americans can launch
a first strike of their own, and your
only possible means of preventing it
— the threat of a retaliatory nuclear

strike —' has been seriously under- .

mined, if not completely destroyed.

 

TIM
VAN GELDER

You desperately need to restore the
balance of power in order to preserve
the security of your homeland. Since
you can't build your own defenses
yet, you do the only thing you can
— build-more offensive 'missi|es
(together with anti-satellite weapons,
decoys, jamming devices and all the
rest). Rather than discarding your
only hope for preventing an Ameri-
can first strike, you will be forced to
build it up as quickly as possible.

Thus, it is dangerously wrong to
suggest that deployment of Star Wars
will lead to a world without nuclear
weapons. If Star Wars is 90 percent
effective —— that is, capable of destroy-_
ing 9 out of 10 Soviet missiles in an
attack wave —- then, to maintain the
same deterrence ability they had be-
fore, they will need 10 times as many
missiles, since only one in 10 will
make it through.

They currently have around 10,000
warheads, all told. lfa 90 percent ef-
fective Star Wars system is deployed,
they will need a further 90,000 war-
heads. If a 99 percent effective Star
Wars is deployed, they will need a
further 990,000 warheads. The arith-
metic becomes absurd, but the cru-
cial point is this: the more effective
Star Wars is, the greater the escala-
tion in the offensive arms race.

Furthermore, suppose that the
Soviets overestimate that Star Wars is
90 percent effective, while in fact it
is only 75 percent effective. On the
above assumptions, the Soviets will
have acquired, as a direct result of
Star Wars deployment, the ability to
actually deliver more warheads than
they could before Star Wars was
deployed. Thus, if the Soviets signifi-
cantly overestimate the capabilities of
Star Wars, we will probably end up
just as, if not more, vulnerable than
we were before. And overestimate
they inevitably will, because it is bet-
ter to err on the safe side, and the
Pentagon is hardly likely to release
the necessary technical data for an ac-
curate assessment.

Having produced many more war-
heads than they previously had, and
most likely being able to deliver more
as well, the Soviets will also be far
more eager to actually launch them.
.To guarantee effective penetration of
the Star Wars shield, they will need

 

to be able to launch as many

weapons as possible. If the Ameri- 

cans get in with a strike first, a large
proportion of their forces will be left
smoking in Siberia, and Star Wars
might be able to successfully cope
with the rest. It becomes even more
urgent to strike first in a possible
nuclear exchange. The hair trigger
becomes lighter than ever, now that
the stakes have been heightened by
missile defenses.

5*‘.

Thus, the strategic consequences of 

Star Wars deployment will be: more
nuclear weapons in existence, more
weapons would be actually launched
and probably more reach their desti-
nation and the probability of launch-
ing is much greater. It is therefore of
utmost importance that Star ' Wars
never be deployed.

Star Wars is at most a bargaining
chip, to be exchanged for an agree-'
ment on massive cuts in offensive
forces. This is why Reykjavik was
such a disastrous failure. The Soviets
were prepared to‘ accept massive cuts
in nuclear weaponry in exchange for
an agreement to delay Star Wars. In-
stead of seizing the opportunity to rid
the world of a huge portion of its
nuclear weapons — the only realis-
tic opportunity of its kind in history
— Reagan chose to preserve a pro-
gram whose only outcome, if ever
deployed, would be a massive esca-
lation of the arms race. Star Wars is
at best a bargaining chip, but Reagan
failed to ‘bargain. '

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 5, I986

Motherhood isa job one can never quit

”Gail was 9 years old,” she said.
”She had been playing over at a
friend's house after school, and when
she got home, I could tell that she
was excited about something. I asked
her what was going on, and she said
that she had learned to play ’Chop-
sticks’ on the piano.”

That was in 1962. The family was
living in Indiana; Gail was the oldest
of five children. It was the first time
the mother had noticed Gail taking
a great interest in anything.

”It was as if she haddiscovered
something about herself that she had
never known before,” the mother
said. ”The fact that she could sit
down at a piano and make music —
it was like a revelation for her.”

The daughter asked if the family
might buy a piano. Finances for the
family weren't great, but at Christmas
time the mother and the father went
to ‘a music store, took a deep breath
and put $50 down on a piano —- a
fine upright Gulbransen. They agreed
to make monthly payments on the pi-
ano for the next two years.

On Christmas morning, Gail came
downstairs and was overwhelmed.
Within weeks she begantaking piano
lessons. Daily, the house was filled

with the soundof her practicing. In
time her younger brothers and sisters
began taking lessons, too. That Gul-
bransen piano was providing a
soundtrack for the family's life.

Gail studied piano for five years
and then learned how to play the
French horn so that she could be a
part of her school's band. It was
amazing to the mother — her 9-year-
old had come home that day so
thrilled about learning ”Chopsticks,”
and then music had indeed become
the central thing in her life.

Gail began telling her family that
she wanted to be a music teacher
when she grew up. She never lost
sight of that goal, all the way through
Indiana University, and when she
graduated and got married and
moved to Ohio with her husband, the
goal was still there.

Gail began looking for music
teaching jobs. There weren't any
available at first. The mother could
hear something in Gail's voice
whenever they talked via long-
distance. So one weekend the fami-
ly rolled the Gulbransen piano out of
the house, loaded it onto a trailer and
drove it over to Ohio so that Gail

could have it in her new home.
Eventually Gail did land a music
teaching job with a school system in
Ohio. ”She just loved it from the first
minute,” the mother said. ’’It was

i I .
..___.._ -..__. . .j..:_...j ._:..._._... ..

' what she had dreamed of all her life

-- spending her time teaching music
to children. When she talked about
it, it made me remember back to
when she was a little girl and when
she taught her younger brother to
play his first song on our piano.”
The mother used to talk to Gail
about it. ”She would tell me that she

wasn't striving for immortality in the
minds of her students,” the mother
said. ”She said her goal wasn't any-
thing fancy like that. She just loved
teaching music, and the teaching was
a reward in itself."

Gail taught in the school system for
six years. She was a little wary about
a trend she saw forming: because of
budget considerations, various
school programs were being .cut
back, one at a time. The school al-
ready had another music teacher,
with seniority, and sometimes Gail
would wonder how safe her job was.

This year she found out. As of this
fall, her position has been eliminat-
ed because of budget cutbacks. Her
job as a music teacher is over.

”She. has been sending out re-
sumes, but it doesn't look as if there

are any jobs available in her area,”

the mother said. ”We talk on the
phone about it. She says that she feels
the thing she was put on Earth to do
has been taken away from her. Her
students have been sending her cards
saying how much they will miss her
this year, and that almost makes it
hurt even more. Sometimes when we
talk about it, she tries to lighten the
mood up, and she'll laugh, but I can

tell it's a laugh to keep from crying.” ’

The mother realizes that. it isn't the

worst tragedyin the world.Afterall, ' I

the daughter is healthy, has her own
family and can depend on a pay-
check every week from her husband.
It isn't the kind of story that people
with real problems have.

”But still,” the mother said, ”I think
of her when she was a little girl, and

I think of her now, not being able to_

do it. It might not mean much to any-
one else, but it means something to
me."

Gail still plays the piano at home.

for 30 minutes or an hour at a time,
making sure her skills remain sharp.
It is as if time is frozen — there she
will be, running her fingers over the
keyboardof that same old upright
Gulbransen the way she did so long
ago in Indiana. I

’’I keep telling her that there is
something better out there waiting for
her," the mother said. ’-’Gail will
listen and just say, ‘Sure, Mom.’ ”

The mother is surprised by how
.much time she spends thinking about

her daughter and wishing that things ~

were different. _ _
”I guess you never quit being a
mother,” she said.

Try to keep in mind that it's your party too

Q. He's OK in bed and would be-
great if he'd stop asking me to tell
him the fantasies I am having while
we make love. I told him I don ’t like
talking then, but he says it turns him
on. Do I have to?

A. No. You don't have to, and I'll
tell you what else — you don't have
to play the harmonica and banjo at
the same time you have sex; you
don't have to do it on water skis —
nothing you find difficult or unap-
pealing. You are supposed to be hav-
ing a good time. It's your party, too.

Perhaps you could tell him some
stories at another time that you think
about during sex with him.-I don't say
the stories have to represent truthfully
your mind at those times. It may be
a blissful blank, so far as you know.
But he can think about what you tell

him during lovemaking. The fantasy
you give him may make him feel
even closer to you than the physical
act of love.

Q. While my girl and! were mak-
ing love'in her room, her mother
walked in and raised hell. As we are
both 24 and really should have our
own places, I was sore at being in
such a dumb situation. But my girl
won't leave home. How can I get her
to? .

A. You have to find out why she
won't move out. Maybe she wants
more commitment from you. Can
you give it? She may still need a
mother —. even one who doesn't
knock before barging in. Possibly at
24 she isn't ready to leave home. Do
you have the understanding and pa-
tience to give to a person who needs
that kind of support?

 

WESTHEIMER

I'm not asking these questions to
make you feel inadequate, but be-

cause you have to think about why g

she won't move out and if you want
to be responsible for her. The best
plan for right now is to go on seeing
her, meeting her, loving her and giv-
ing her self-reliance time to grow.
Q. I was married to a wife-beater
who was in a behavior-modification
program. /ust as things were getting
better, he was killed. For three years
I have just stayed home with my
preschoolers and was happy to do
that. The idea of men frightens me.
Am I getting stuck_in a bad pattern?

. A. Well, you think you are, and the
best thingyou can do is to take steps
to change that. And you have taken
the first step by asking me, right?

But you do have to think of the fu-
ture, one not so far off, when those
tiny children grow up and go off,
leaving you alone — unless you have

someone to be your mature compan- .

ion, your man. It is not too soon to
think about that.

First, I want you to make up a little
sentence — ”Lots of nice men all
over this state and all. over the
U.S.A.” Fit those words to some lit-
tle tune and get into the habit of sing-

ing it to yourself — because you are’

naturally afraid of men, but not all
men are abusive. That is a special
sickness.

Then I would get into some volun-
teer work, like hospital work, where
you will meet men coming and go-
ing. Or join a church singles group
or a Parents Without Partners chap-
ter, but I especially recommend
groups where people meet and do
things together and share ideals and
ideas. Good luck, and let me know
how things go. ’ ‘

High tech telephone systems won't get us jobs

In the beginning, colleges were to
be places for the most intelligent
members of a society to meet and
learn. Somewhere between the be-
ginning and now, that ideal was lost,
and the universities have become lit-
tle more than bastions of rhetoric.

The most important thing any stu-
dent can gain from college is an edu-
cation. I have to wonder what kind
of education anyone will be getting
as the university advances into the
”Campus of the Future.”

When time is devoted to publiciz-
ing Pitt's future, I hear of the new
phone system, fiber optics commu-
nications and high-tech. High-tech

There aren't too many people who
really know what went on up there
— ”up there” being the summit in
Iceland- As a matter of fact, I think I
am the only person who really
knows, but, in spite of that, I think I
am ready to talk about it now. Yes,
I'm ready to talk about it, even
though it's keeping me up nights.

It started smoothly, but things got
out of hand when Reagan and Gor-
bachev got together alone. They
weren't really alone. There were the
interpreters‘. And me, of course, hid-
ing behind the table with my notepad
and my periscope.

Reagan was very confident when
he stepped into the room, which was

strikes me as a nebulous catch-all for
all the things we don't understand. I
like to think about the possible dia-
logue between a Pitt grad and a
prospective employer:

‘'50 you went to Pitt? What was it
about your education you expect
makes you different from all my other
candidates?”

"Pitt has the Campus of the Fu-
ture,” the grad says with all the pride
he's been taught to feel. The employ-
er notices the graduate’s futuristic at-
titude, the one that's sure to carry him
into the next century. _

"What's the Campus of the Future;
is that a new teaching technique?”

as well. He was carrying an armload
of miniature nuclear missiles (about
a foot high), some with ”CCCP”

printed on the sides and some with "

’’USA.’’ They, I reasoned, were un-
doubtedly going to be used to
represent warheads in various posi-
tions. By the thousands, probably.

I was impressed. They were both
prepared and looked as if they were
ready to deal.

Things went sour from the first
word. They soon discovered that
their interpreters didn't speak the
right languages. Reagan's interpreter

So there it is: Reagan and Gor-

gave up after a while. Both of them
seemed to realize that they couldn't

Then Reagan looked up, a light

Then he ran back, picked up the

missile. He missed. He set up two
more and tried again. Missed again.
Gorbachev was intrigued. "He gath-

The Pitt grad walks out of the

’’There was one I liked from the
University of Pittsburgh, but every
time I try to call, no one knows how

neither of them had scored a point

had been positioned there.

They were bad bowlers. Being. a
veteran of many hours of professional
bowling on television, I can safely say
that Reagan and Gorbachev were
horrible bowlers. They couldn't have
hit a missile ifthe world had depend-
ed on it.‘

Anyway, they came back for more

sessions after that first one, and I.

time, Reagan matched Gorbachev

Lamda Chi Alpha begins escort
service to protect Pitt students

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer ll

Responding to recent Oakland-area
crime, Pitt's Lamda Chi Alpha frater-

‘ nity chapter started a student escort

service Monday.
The service is available to students
walking between any two points on

— campus or between the campus and
, South Oakland.

Escorts can be requested from 7:30
p.m. to 12:30 p.m. Sunday through

Thursday.

To be escorted, a student must call
the Lamda Chi Alpha house at
683-2575 or 687-2369. One of the
two volunteer brothers on escort duty

_takes the call and goes to walk with

the student.

”We will be’wearing our green
jackets so that we will be a visible
presence," said chapter president Joe

’ Daum.

According to Daum, the idea for an
escort service evolved from a sugges-
tion made by one of Lamda Chi Al-
pha’s national consultants during a

recent visit. The brothers agreed that
since Pitt had a large urban campus,
an escort service would be a good
idea. '

Daum said that lnterfraternity
Council Advisor Bridget Guernsey
supported the idea, and she told
Todd Underiner, chapter vice presi-
dent, that she didn’t anticipate the ef-
fort having any problems.

Guernsey also informed Daum of
a similar program in a Lamda Chi Al-
pha chapter at the University of Cin-
cinnati four years ago.

”We’ve been talking to a few of the
members of that chapter and are get-
ting advice on how to run the pro-
gram better and what problems to
look out for,” said Daum.

The service will not be offered on
weekends.

According to Daum, the brothers
are worried about complications in-
volved with “escorting drunk
people.” 4

”We wanted to provide the serv-
ice for people studying,” said Un-
deriner. ’’I don't think too many

people study on Friday nights.”

Because the Lamda Chi Alpha
house is in South Oakland, escorts
will not be available for the North
Oakland area‘.

”We’re hoping that once we get
this started, we can get one of the
fraternities in North Oakland to help
us,” said Underiner. ”We haven't
talked to any yet because we want-
ed to see what kind of response we
got.” '

Monday night only two students re-
quested an escort. But enthusiasm for
the program among the brother
volunteers remains high. .

The brothers have publicized the
event by sending flyers to each sorori-
ty on campus. They are currently
looking into placing signs in the resi-
dence halls.

”We’ve got a schedule set up for.

two different brothers to take escort
duty for the next two weeks,” said
Daum. 2

”We all think it's a good way to
meet people and also be a service to
the university." '

Pitt leading in blood drive

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer '

That the Panthers will beat the
undefeated Nittany Lions in their
upcoming brawl is questionable.
But if yesterday's results are any
indication, the University of Pitts-
burgh will prevail over its cross-
state rival in another competition
—— blood donating. -

According to Marge Brown of
the Central Blood Bank, after one
day, Pitt supporters have con-

tributed 533 pints; Penn State has,

come up with 509.

Brown is optimistic that the
drive will continue to be success-
ful. She said this year’s results are
likely to be the best ever.

”This year,” she stated, ”we
had 129 students show up in the
Assembly Room. That's more than
we had last year on the first day.”
Brown praised students for doing

”a beautiful 'ob.” _ .
Jean Mc amel, who lS in

charge of collecting blood at Pitt,
believes students are motivated by
school spirit. ”Students say they're
giving blood to beat Penn State,”
she said. McName| added that
over 150 students contributed
Monday.

Administrators aren't the only
ones who are excited about the
blood drive. Students as well
seem quite enthused. John
Smelko, a chemical engineering
student, said he hopes his dona-

tion will help alleviate chronic
blood shortage.

.’’It seems like the Blood Bank
is always short of blood,” Smelko
said. ’’I hope my donation will
help them out. Besides, I like to
beat Penn State."

Surprisingly, though, school
spirit may not be as strong as one
would think. In addition to giving
blood, students at both Pitt and
Penn State are voting for their
favorite schools. Brown said that
some Pitt students were voting for
Penn State.

Overall, here in Pittsburgh, 452
voted for Pitt while 275 voted for
Penn State._ In Western Pennsylva-
nia, Penn State received 234 votes
and Pitt received 81.

College presidents on the

Editor's Note: This is the second in
a series of three articles produced for
The Associated Press by the Pennsyl-
'vania Association of Colleges and

‘ Universities in observance of,Higher

Education Week.

PITTSBURGH (AP) —.- In an era of
increasing competition for students
and funds, Pennsylvania's college
presidents are spending more and
more time on the road. They also

y continue to speak out on a variety of

controversial and far-ranging issues.

”No question about it,” said Mary
Patterson McPherson, now in her
ninth year as president of Bryn Mawr.
”By necessity, we're away from our
institutions more than ever before.”

Many college and university presi-

412-422-S000

dents travel across the country, rais-
ing funds, speaking to alumni groups
and promoting admissions activites.

”We’re out there,” McPherson
said, ”telling our institution's story to
all our constituencies.”

But McPherson and other presi-
dents -— among them Swarthmore’s
David Fraser, Drexel’s William
Gaither and the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Wesley Posvar —— are also ad-
dressing national and international
concerns.

David Fraser, now in his fourth
year at Swarthmore, was leading
spokesman on the issue of linking
student financial aid with registration
for the draft. He testified before Con-
gress that such a policy unfairly
penalized poor people.

Fraser and many other Pennsylva-
nia college presidents are worried
that mounting college costs will deny
higher education opportunities to a
growing number of Americans.

”We do not believe in merit
scholarships at Swarthmore,” Fraser
said. And the college is making a
push to significantly increase need-
based financial aid. This effort is cost-
ly, but Fraser argues that ”the risk is
worth taking.”

Fraser typifies a new breed of col-
lege president — outgoing, energet-
ic, devoted to causes. Like several of
his colleagues, his background is not
in academic administration.

A medical doctor, Fraser was an
epidemiologist for several years with
the Centers for Disease Control in At-
lanta. He led the team that tracked
down the cause of Legionnaires

disease. *

William S. Gaither, president of
Drexel University, brought both a
strong academic and engineering
background to his current post. As a
maritime engineer, he became an ex-
pert on ports, and waterfront and ma-

rine structures. Gaither envisions a V

national effort to build vast undersea
cities someday. ”But don't make me
out to be a dreamer — I'm an en-
gineer and a college president,” he
said. ‘

When Gaither is on the road, -he
often addresses the implications of
the ”knowledge explosion” that has
transformed modern life. He notes
that ”the gap between our best edu-
cated citizens and our least educat-
ed citizens is growing greater and
greater every year. The result is a
major dilemma for our society.”

road more than “ever

Ciaither said that the widening gap
in knowledgewill likely change the
nature of democracy and ”make it in-
creasingly difficult” to govern the
country.

”Presidents make decisions with
the advice of Ph.D.s, but how are
average voters to make informed
choices?” The society of the future,
he suggests, ’’will either be thrilling
or terrifying._”

Bryn Mawr’s'McPherson, a former
philosophy professor, also speaks out
on national issues involving educa-
tion and politics. She is very con-
cerned about ”ensuring access for
minority students” and is critical of
emerging trends in reduced federal
and state funding.

.McPherson sees signs of _”inap-
propriate government intrusions into
academic life” in the areas of classi-
fied information, drug-testing and
draft registration. She has written an
open letter to President Reagan op-
posing his South African policy.

Pitt’s Posvar regularly addresses
another issue involving federal
spending —— the support of basic
research in this country. Posvar, a
leading spokesman on the evolving
role of university-based research, said
American research institutions are
”entering a new era of vitality, ex-
panding on their traditional roles of
educator, observer and critic.”

Posvar believes innovative alli-
ances among universities, govern-

ment and the corporate community .

will ”pioneer the accelerated trans-
fer of basic research into new pro-
ducts and services competitive in
world markets.” _

Posvar contends these new alli-
ances ’’will directly address the
dominant problems of our time: fal-
tering economic productivity; social
inequities; sweeping technological
change; and an increasingly violent
and turbulent world.”

A graduate of West Point and a
former military pilot, Posvar w-as
head of the political science depart-
ment at the Air Force Academy be-
fore coming to Pitt in 1967.

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt's Congemi

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief

”Be prepared!”

Pitt head football coach Mike Gott-
fried hopes his players are familiar
with that popular saying — the mot-
to of the Boy Scouts of America.

The reason is because Gottfried has
an injury list longer than Fifth
Avenue, and the name at the head of
that list is quarterback John Congemi.

A fifth-year senior from Lauderdale
Lakes, Fla., Congemi is lost for the
season with a hairline fracture in his
back.

Gottfried will find out very soon ,

who the Eagle Scouts and the Cub
Scouts are on his team. Pitt hosts un-
defeated, top-ranked Miami this
weekend at Pitt Stadium.

The question that faces Gottfried
now is: Who will replace Congemi?
' He has his choice between three
candidates. Junior college transfer Sal
Genilla, who battled Congemi all
through fall camp for the starting po-
sition, and freshman Larry Wanke,
perhaps Pitt's quarterback of the fu-
ture, are the first two choices. Gott-
fried had originally planned to
redshirt-.Genil|a and Wanke. Junior
Joe Felitsky is the third candidate. He
was promoted to Congemi’s back-up
after Gottfried decided he wanted to
redshirt Genilla and Wanke."

lf Genilla plays, he cannot be red-
shirted, and next year he would be
declared a senior. The same goes for
Wanke if he plays, except that he
would be declared a sophomore next
year.’ ‘

Gottfried said he has not arrived at

» any decisions as of yet.

”lfl knew what I was going to do,
I would tell you,” Gottfried said
yesterday. ”The only thing I can say
is that whoever it is, I think he will
be very successful.”

And judging from his candidates’

— prior performances, Gottfried has rea-

son to believe that.

4' Genilla, a 6-3, 205-pounder from
San Mateo, Calif., was the most pro-
lific passer in junior college history. '

He holds numerous JC records, in-
cluding most yards passing i_n a sea-
son (3,555) and most yards total
offense in one season (3,607).

Wanke, a 6-2, 195-pounder from
Cleveland, Ohio, amassed 5,088
yards passing and threw for 50 touch-
downs in his career at Benedictine
High School. As a senior, he complet-
ed 201 of 366 passes (54.9 percent)
for 3,045 yards.

Both were impressive during fall
camp, but lately, both have been
regulated to charting playson the Pitt
sidelines.

Gottfried said it would be impor-
tant to get Congemi’s replacement as
many snaps as possible in practice
before Saturday's game with Miami.

Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, a
former assistant coach at Pitt, said the
change at quarterback for Pitt would
not influence how his team prepares
for the game.

”We will prepare for the run and
shoot, and we will prepare for the
power running game,” Johnson «said.
”But we would have prepared that
way if Congemi was playing.”

Congemi had grasped Gottfried’s
complicated offense with ease and
was, according to Gottfried, ”a coach
on the field.”

”This is a toughlloss for the team
and forJohn,” Gottfried said. ’’I really
feel for him.

’’I’m proud of him and what he has
accomplished here,” Gottfried add-
ed. ”lt has been an honor to have had
the opportunity to coach a young
man like John Congemi.”

Congemi injured his back in the
first quarter of Pitt's 24-20 upset loss
at Syracuse. He returned in the sec-
ond quarter and finished with 17
completions in 35 attempts for 243
yards and a touchdown.

Congemi has completed 165 of
293 passes for 2,048 yards, 11 touch-
downs and six interceptions in eight
games this season. His 6,467 career
passing yards rank second at Pitt to
Dan Marino’s 8,597 yards.

A junior from Pittsburgh, Pa.,
Felitsky has thrown 11 times this
season, completing six for 60
yards.

He is the only Pitt quarterback,
other than Congemi, who has Di-
_ vision I experience.

Felitsky was promoted from
fourth string to second string when
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried decided
to redshirt Sal Genilla and Larry
Wanke. ,

A junior from San Mateo, Calif.,
Genilla was originally going to sit
out this year and take a redshirt.
He would have two years of eligi-
bility left if he remains with that
plan, otherwise he will be a senior
next year.

Genilla battled for the starting
job with Congemi during fall
camp, but lost out. There is no
doubt,'however, he will be Pitt's
starting quarterback next fall.

He was the most prolific passer
in junior college history, once

‘throwing for 593 yards in one
game. Afavorite. , 1

A freshman from Cleveland, 0h.,
Wanke is Pitt's quarterback of the
future. It is only a matter of time
before Wanke begins his assault on
the Pitt passing records. The only
thing Wanke lacks is experience.
The physical ability is there.

Like Sal Genilla, Wanke is being
redshirted, and if he plays one
down, he loses the redshirt and will
be a sophomore next season.

Another question: If Wanke

plays and finishes the year as Pitt's '

quarterback, who is the No. 1
quarterback entering spring drills?
Wanke or Genilla?»A sleeper.

A sophomore from Wildwood
Crest, N.J., Osborn was originally
recruited as a quarterback by Foge
Fazio’s staff. Currently, he is a
Pitt's leading reciever with 28
catches for 352 yards and two

' touchdowns.

He has tossed one pass this year,
a 39 yard touchdown pass to Ver-
non Kirk during Pitt's 48-16 win
over West Virginia.

. Should Felitsky get hurt, and
Gottfried decidehe wants to red-
_shirt Genilla and Wanke, Osborn
might get the call. A longshot.

The only things Craig Heyward
will throw around on Saturday are
linebackers and defensive backs
for a certain Miami team — not th
Dolphins either. -

Heyward completed a pass two
years ago at the Carrier Dome
against Syracuse, and he tried to let

one fly against Notre Dame thjs - P

year, but he was ruled out of
bounds.

Heyward will line up in the back-
field, but not behind center.
Sorry Iron — a real longshot.

”Ossie has been struggling because
he's coming off a knee injury,” ob-

playing up front for us because he is
a good passer and has good vision
recognizing situations. It's a matter of
him getting healthy.”

”Seckin has a tremendous attitude
and is a hard worker,” Luxbacher
added. ”He’s physically strong and

Ablek’s admiration for Luxbacher
is mutual. '

”Joe gets us prepared for games,”
said Ablek, a senior majoring in aer-

understand why each game is impor-
tant. When we were finally ranked [in
the Middle Atlantic region], he told
us that this is where most teams take
it easy, and he won't let us do that.”

Osberg, a sophomore industrial en-'

praise for Luxbacher.

our best, yet he doesn't raise his
voice when it comes to getting his
point across.” .

Ablek is one player capable of get-
ting his point across, even if only
players can understand it. Ablek was
born and raisedin Upper St. Clair,
but his parents are from Turkey, the
native land of Panthers’ forward Erim
Gude.

’’I sometimes tell Seckin that the
only reason he's around is that he is

the only one who can understand
Erim,” Luxbacher joked.

Being able to speak a foreign lan-
guage does have its advantages,
though.

”In the Vanderbilt game, one thing
in particular happened,” recalled
Ablek. ”We had a corner kick, a sit-
uation where we like to get our taller
players inside. I looked for an open-
ing, and when I saw one, I told Erim
in Turkish where he should kick it.
It hasn't worked yet, but we're hop-
ing it will sometime because nobody
knows what we're talking about.”

Ablak and Osberg do know what
they are talking about when they
stress the importance of the Panthers’
games in the closing games of the
regular season. _

”OUI games with the Big East op-
ponents are extremely important,”
stressed Osberg. ’/These are the
games that we must go out and win.”

Ablak and Osberg are accustomed
to being with a highly ranked team,
having played high school soccer for.
Upper St. Clair. They expect nothing
less from Pitt, and each is doing his

- part to see the team achieve its goal.

Soccer team closes season with victory over IUP 

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

Even though the Panther soccer
team didn’t make the Big East tour-
nament, they managed to beat the
IUP Indians 2-0 last night to end their
season.

”We played very well tonight,”
said Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher. "I'm
very pleased. It was a good way to
end the season”

The game started out slow. There
was an exchange of kicks in the mid-
dleof the field. Every once in a while
the ball would be kicked down the
field,,but the goalies would pick it up
and throw it back. This continued for
the first five minutes of the game,
with no serious scoring threats.

Then with 40 minutes left in the
half, Pitt broke through for a score.
They drove down the side of the field
and passed it through the Indian
defense.‘ Panther senior Mike Grimes,
playing in his last game at Pitt, end-.
ed up with the ball. He faked the
goalie out of the play and put it into
the net, giving Pitt a 1-0 lead.

”I think this was the best game we
have played all season,” said Panther
player Erim Gude. ”Everybody want-
ed to win tonight. I'm happy that we

Pitt started to take control of the

Every once in a while the Indians
would break the pressure and ‘try to

ricks would send them back.

’’I don't think our team ever adjust-
ed to the turf,” said IUP coach Vince
Celtnieks. ”It was really wet and that
gives the ball a different bounce. Our
defense was confused, but Pitt did
play a good game. We should have
played better, though.”

With 12 minutes left in the half, Pitt
had the ball again‘. They eventually
ended up-with a penalty kick, and
Panther Dari Liberati put it in for Pitt's
second goal of the game.

Staff Writer

The kid gloves are off.

No more McPherson or Byrne or
Beuerlien or Saltz. This is the big-big-
time. It's Testaverde time. And expect
the atmosphere to be filled with
footballs.

When the unanimously No. 1 Mi-
ami Hurricanes storm into town, no
one will feel their high-powered
wrath more than the Panther defen-
sive backs. Hurricane quarterback
Vinnie Testaverde has been looking
for a challenge, and, this far into the
1986 season, he hasn't found one.

"Florida State tried and failed. Same

with Cincinnati, South Carolina, even
the mighty Oklahoma Sooners. The
'Canes passing attack thrashed these
teams also. Now it's Pitt's turn to step
into the ring, and it couldn't have
come at a worse time.

The Panther secondary is hurting
with at least a half dozen injuries on
the roster. The Panthers are battle-

worn with the biggest game of the
year just ahead.

Yet, is there any doubt that they'll
come out hitting, jamming receivers
with each snap, picking off passes,
stringing out sweeps?

"We’re gonna be ready, definite-
ly,” said freshman cornerback
Michael Hadley. "This game is a real
challenge to us. We may not be 100
percent physically, but if we can
reach a peak at any point in the sea-
son, this is the game.”

Indeed, this is the game. And
they're gonna have their hands full
the whole afternoon. "Testaverde is
the best throwing quarterback in col-
lege," remarked junior cornerback
Quintin Jones at Tuesday's football
luncheon. "He has a great arm and
the ability to avoid the blitz. If you
don't sack him or get to him with the
blitz, he'll make something happen,”
Jones continued. "They also have
great running backs with talent to
receive the ball. They really mix it up
on offense well.”

’’I’m impressed with their
receivers,” Hadley revealed. "Blades,
lrvin, Wilson — they're all quick and
can hold on to the ball. They remind
me a lot of N.C. State's and
Maryland's receivers.”

But the key, Hadley noted, is
Testaverde.

”With their quarterback you know
the ball will be there for the receivers
to catch. They might not be able to
get wide open because of the cover-
age, but he gets it to them, and that
makes up for everything,” Hadley ex-
plained.

With such a battered defensive
backfield, do the Panthers have any
chance at stopping this passing
machine? In this game, anything is
possible. It'll take a tremendous ef-
fort from the entire team, as any
master-of-the-obvious would
proclaim.

But the key — the true key — to
Saturday's football fiesta, will ‘lie in
taking Miami's strength away from
them (i.e. scrambling the airwaves).
Force the Hurricane ground attack to
challenge Pitt's fine rushing defense.
Then we'll talk about an upset.

Miami ace looking no further than Pitt

.7)‘

gr

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

Well Pitt fans, the time has come
for us to meet Vinny, and we can all
be sure it will be ”hurricane" season
in Pittsburgh this weekend.

Vinny Testaverde, quarterback of
the No. 1 rated college football team
in the country, the Miami Hurricanes,
will be meeting the Panthers this
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. Is he ready
for us? He thinks he is. The big ques-
tion is, are we ready for him?

”People keep asking me whether
or not I'm thinking of things other
than this week's game. The answer
is no,” said Testaverde. ”Pitt has al-
ways been a strong team; I don't care
what the polls say. Also, they have

beaten us before. Right now, beating -

Pittsburgh comes first in my mind.”

Testaverde this year has led the
Hurricanes in an 8-0 victory record.
The team is proving itself a strong
contender for the national champion-
ship, and Testaverde is the favorite
1986 Heisman Trophy candidate. But
has the success gone to Vinny’s
head?

"I think we have proven that we
have a good team," said Testaverde.
”The victories are definitely satisfy-
ing, and I still have a lot of good feel-
ings about the team. I know we have
the talent to, go all the_way.

”As far as the Heisman goes, I real-
ly am not thinking about it. If it comes
my way I'll be happy, but right now
our remaining games come first, the
Heisman second,” Testaverde said.

Testaverde hadn't heard about
Pitt's loss of quarterback John Con-
gemi due to a back injury. When he

‘ heard the news he sounded sorry, but

he still feels the Miami defense will
have to work hard trying to stop the
Panther push. a

"John Congemi, [from] what I
know of him, is a fine athlete. I have
always wanted to meet him here in
Florida. It really means a lot to us to
see him play," said Testaverde.

’’I'm very sorry to hear he is hurt.
Like I said, this game means a lot to
us, and I'm sure it means a lot to him.
But football is a game where you get
hurt easily, and these things happen.”

Testaverde said his main improve.-
ment this year has not really been his

have said, but his ability to read other
teams’ defenses and then act tactical-
ly against them.

”When people ask me about other
[teams'] quarterbacks, I tell them I
don't know about them. I don't fol-
low other offensive players. In my po-
sition I have to look at the defense
squads that will be charging at me on
«the field. From the experiences I've
had, I feel I can do this well."

Overall, Testaverde feels he has
had a very lucky and very beneficial
college football experience, includ-
ing the fact he was benched two
seasons.

”If I had to do it all over again, I
wouldn't change a thing. I really feel
the bench has made me a better quar-

terback and a better person. No, there
is nothing I would change," said
Testaverde. 0

Even if Vinny is reluctant to beat
his own drum, Miami coach Jim
Johnson isn't. He feels Testaverde is
truly a great football player.

”Vinny is truly one of the finest
players I've ever worked with," said
Johnson. "I don't care what anybody

‘says. He is truly deserving of the

Heisman."

"In football, the team is what
comes first, where every player is im-
portant. We're all in this together,
and everyone on the team realizes
this. Along with being a great player
in his own right, Vinny is also a ter-
rific team player," said Johnson.

Johnson said he is very proud of the
Miami team this year, even going as
far as saying it is one of the most
talentgd_he has eve‘r_worked with.

However, he, like Testaverde, feels

they will have to work hard against
the Panthers. "

"One of my main concerns is that '

it is a road game. Also, the weather
may play a part. But the biggest thing
is the Pittsburgh team. I know it takes
a lot to beat Pittsburgh, and I know
we will try. We're going to do what
we have to do to win ball games."

Testaverde said he does not know

what he will be doing this time next ‘

year, but he does know what he is
doing now.

’’I don't see anything really for next
year; I have to worry about this year.
Right_now I'm thinking about Pitts-
burgh, and I think I'm ready for them.
I hope they're ready for us, because
we're on our way."

' PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh
Steelers have returned to the physi-
cal style of play that gained them a
reputation for ferocity in the 19705;
and Coach Chuck Noll said it's no
coincidence that they've also
returned to the victory column.

The Steelers have allowed only five
field goals in consecutive victories
over Cincinnati 30-9 and Green Bay
27-3 ”and when you play defense
like that, you're going to win games,”
Noll said Monday.

The Steelers’ physical, gang-
tackling defense seemed to unsettle

_ both the Bengals and the Packers. A

vicious hit by Steelers’ safety Dave
Edwards on Cincinnati wide receiver
Tim McGee had Bengals coach Sam
Wyche calling for an NFL investiga-
tion, and Packers coach Forrest
Gregg became increasingly upset
Sunday as the Steelers successfully at-
tempted to intimidate his- team.

What we have done speaks well for this team.
Now, we've got to continue to ‘get better, to get
our streak even longer than It Is.

’’It was like we were physically
afraid to play,” Gregg said.

”Some of their guys acted like they
didn't want to catch the ball,’’ said
linebacker Bryan Hinkle.

”The three points speak well for
our defense,” Noll said. ”The offense
is playing well and taking advantage
of the opportunities the defense is
presenting us.”

Noll was grinning broadly at his
weekly news conference, and for
good reason. For the first time in
nearly a year, his Steelers have won
two games in a row.

sure, but the two straight victories
have given the 3-6 Steelers something
they didn't have two weeks ago:
hopes of salvaging their season.

”What we have done speaks well
for this team,” Noll said. ”Now,
we've got to continue to get better,
to get our streak even longer than it
Is.”

The Steelers remain three games
behind American Conference Central
Division co—leaders Cleveland and
Cincinnati. But they're in the middle
of a streak that sees them play three
of the NFL’s weakest teams: Green

Steelers’ defense playinglike ol

The Steelers play Sunday at
Buffalo.

”We had some injuries in some
key spots that hurt us, but now we're
getting some of these people back,”
Noll said.

Even when one of his injured regu-
lars, wide receiver Louis Lipps,
wasn't able to play against Green Bay
because of back spasms, Noll found
more than a capable replacement on
his own bench in third-year pro Wee-
gie Thompson.

The 6-6 Thompson, who caught
only eight passes in the Steelers’ first
eight games, had six receptions for 78
yards and three touchdowns. His
scoring catches included a 6-yard div-
ing fingertip grab and a 9-yard alley-
oop leap over Packers’ cornerback Ed
Berry. «
Noll hinted that Thompson may
keep his starting job even when Lipps
is able to play again. The Steelers’.
other starting wide receiver is Calvin
Sweeney, who has been subbing for
the injured John Stallworth. Sweeney

”We’ve got to get Louis back and

somebody who's producing back on
the bench."

ning streak in November 1985, when
they beat Cleveland 10-9, Kansas City
36-28 and Houston 20-7 in succes-
sion. But they won only one of their
final five games and had won only
two of their previous 12 games until
manhandling the Bengals and the
Packers.

Noll, meanwhile, said he moved
reserve tackle Mark Behning into the
offensive line rotation ”because he's
been playing well, especially in short-
yardage situations  he made a great
block on one of their cornerbacks on
one play.”

‘To make room for Behning, right
tackle Tunch llkin was periodically
moved to the left side, where he
relieved Ray Pinney.

paces Pens
to 2-2 tie

PITTSBURGH (AP) —- Only a third
period effort by Mario Lemieux
spared the Pittsburgh Penguins from
a home loss to the NHL’s worst team.

Lemieux scored his league-leading
17th goal midway through the third
period as the Penguins salvaged a 2-2
with the Vancouver Canucks
Tuesday.

”Lemieux earned them their point
tonight,” Canucks Coach Tom Watt
said.

The Penguin center scored at 10:21
when he took a pass from Dan
Frawley, fought off a check from
defenseman Dave Richter and
banked a shot into the upper right
corner off the goal post.

”You have to give Lemieux credit
because he made a great play,’’ Watt
said. ’’I thought we worked hard the
whole game but hard work isn’t al-
ways necessarily rewarded the way
it should be.” A

Vancouver outshot Pittsburgh
37-26, but the Canucks, who have
had problems generating offense all
season, could beat veteran goalie
Gilles Meloche only twice.

The first goal came 44 seconds af-
ter the game started when Jim Sand-
lak beat Meloche from a sharp angle.
He overpowered the goalie with .a'
hard shot from the base of the right
circle. e

”He just put the brakes on and

_ caught me out of position,” Meloche

said. "He got good wood on it.”

After Moe Mantha scored on a se-
cond period power play to give Pitts-
burgh a 1-1 tie, the Canucks
answered with a power-play score.

Rick Lanz shot the puck from the
right point and Tanti tipped it in for
his third goal. Meloche tried to grab ’
the puck with his glove and ended
up directing it into the net.

”We probably could have won this
game,” Tanti said. ”We’ve been
struggling, so we'll take a tie and
hope it's the start of turning things
around.”

The tie ended the Canucks’ four-
game losing streak and extended
Pittsburgh's winless streak to four.
The Penguins are 1-3-2vsince open-
ing the season with seven consecu-
tive wins.

”We were very fortunate to get a
point,” Pittsburgh Coach Bob Berry
said. ”We knew by the end of the first
period that Vancouver had come
here to work but we had some guys
who didn't seem to be able to pick
up that challenge.’’

Berry declined to single out any

~ players for criticism but it's obvious

he ,was not talking about Lemieux,
who has at least one point in each of

 

1‘).
