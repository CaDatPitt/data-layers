GPSA president: grad student unionizers are

The campaign to unionize
grad students is premature and
members of the union move-
ment are “living in a vacuum”,
according to the president of
the Gradute and Professional
Students Association.

Brian Ulery, GPSA presi-
dent, said he was not opposed
to the idea of a union, but feels
the union movement’s goals
are financially impossible.

' “Tuition would be at a
point where I’m not sure who

would be able to afford it,”
Ulery said. “Sure the graduate
student [employees] would
have alighter workload. We
wouldn’t have an under-
gradute population besides
those who can afford much
much more than they pay
now.” ‘

But spokespersons for the
Campaign to Organize
Graduate Students question
how Pitt justifies pay increases
for administrators while the
living wage of grad students
stays low. '

“Every time someone says

there isn’t enough money for a
certain program, the books
should be opened,” said COGS
spokesman Frank Joseph.

more money should be
requested.

According to the chancel-

people realize.

An article by

MOSCOW — Russian President
Boris Yeltsin ‘is making‘ a quick
recovery after the bypass of five
arteries in his heart. He left the heart
center Monday, where his surgery
took place only a few days earlier, to
be in the Kremlin Hospital where he
could set up an office.

Ycltsin’s doctor and the Kremlin
both say he has been recovering
quickly, and they expect that he could
be back to his presidential duties
within two weeks. Dr. Rcnat

Akchurin, the president’s surgeon,-

told the NTV network, “If all goes as
it has so far, Boris [Yeltsin] will be
moving about actively in the hospital,
and in 10 to 12 days he will quite eas-
ily fulfill most of his duties.”

CANNES, France — This past
weekend, Pierre Salinger, a former
spokesman for President Kennedy
and ABC news correspondent from
1978 - 83, said he has a government
document that says TWA ‘ﬂight 800
was accidentally shot down by ‘Navy
gunners while conducting missile
tests, killing all 230 people on board.
Salinger said he was willing to give
the FBI the document and its “very
important details that show the plane
was brought down by a U.S. Navy
missile.”

According to Salinger, the Navy

was told that all planes would be fly-
ing at an altitude of at least 21,000
feet since they would be testing mis-
siles off the coast of New York.
Flight 800 was flying at an altitude of
only 13,000 feet because of another
plane that was flying above it.

Ukrainian ambassador visits

THE PITT NEWS 3

O

nationality room, encourages
study of Slavic country

Michael  Hoffman

   

Spending a large part of his lecture
speaking his native language, the
Ukrainian Ambassador to the United
States made a goodwill stop at Pitt this
week to inspect the nationality room
dedicated to his homeland.

Ambassador Yuri Shcherbak dis-
cussed the economic and political status
of his country in the Ukranian room
with members of Pitt’s Elementary
Ukranian class, while stressing the
importance of the youth’s role in the
development of the newly independent
country.

“We need more young people from
the United States who are willing to
learn the history, business, and the
economy of the Ukraine to study and
work in the Ukraine,” said Shcherbak.
“It’s important to learn not only the lan-
guage, but the current politics as well.”

Kateryna Dowbenko, head of Pitt’s
Slavic department, was extremely
encouraged with Shcherbak’s devotion
to the students.

“I was very glad that he empha-

sized the importance of the youth’s role
in the future of Ukraine,” Dowbenko
said. “His main point was to encourage
the students to study in Ukraine.”

There are a lot of U.S companies
operating in the Ukraine, according to
Dowbenko, and she said students who
understand the culture have a greater
opportunity to find international
employment.

“By the students studying the
Ukrainian language and culture [at
Pitt], it will help the U.S. better under-
stand more about the country,” she said.

Carolyne Hanych, a Pitt sopho-
more, explained that her heritage
played a major role in deciding to learn
the'Ukrainian language.

“My grandfather and my father
were born there, and my grandmother
tells me stories of life‘ in Ukraine,” she
said. “That’s why I want to ﬂuently
learn the language.”

Before serving as ambassador of
Ukraine to the United States, Shcherbak
was the Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel
from 1992 to 1994. He became ambas-
sador to the United States in November
of 1994.

a system that has nothing to do with the
quality of education,” said Wuertele.
“Pitt’s academic offerings are much,
much better than those presented in the
rankings.”

Currently, U.S. News uses criteria
such as how much money is spent per
student, student retention and graduation
rates, and the number of faculty with doc-
torates to rate colleges and universities.

The SGB, at its Oct. 30 meeting,
passed a resolution asking Pitt to join in
the petition initiated by Stanford
University that U.S. News and World
Report change the criteria they use to
rank schools. SGB members feel the
report is biased toward Ivy League and
private institutions.

“We feel that U.S. News and World
Report is glossing over the real story,"
said David Teeters, author of the SGB
resolution. “Higher education should not

be ranked this way.”

According to Teeters, the U.S. News
rankings do a disservice to Pitt and its
students because employers outside of
Pittsburgh have little else to go on when
deciding the quality of a Pitt graduate’s
education. Teeters said the schools Pitt
would be joining in this petition are those
usually ranked within the top ﬁve in
America by the report.

While Pitt is not ranked among the
top 50 schools by U.S. News, it is one of
only 57 schools in America to become a
member of the American Association of
Universities, a prestigious group of some
of America’s top research schools,
according to Teeters.

“The full impact of what we do is not
yet fully-appreciated,” said Nordenberg
in his Senate Council report. “We will be

300 hopeful students turn out for first Internship Fair

Anne McLeod ‘

 

Some were dressed casual-
ly, others were in suits, but peo-
ple at the first Internship Fair
held at Pitt yesterday said it
didn’t matter how a person was
dressed. Presence is what mat—
tered.

The Student Government
Board, the CAS Dean’s Office,
and the Placement Service
hosted the event held on
Monday, Nov. 11, in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom.
Turnout for the fair was close to
300 students.

“We gave out more infor-
mation in one night, than we
would have given out in an
entire week,” said Patti Lee
from the Placement Service.

Companies such as
Northwestern Mutual,
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, In
Pittsburgh, Toys ‘R’ Us,
JCPenney and university rela-
tions were all on hand to talk to
students about possible intem—
ships.

“I was really disappointed
that the representative for the
Penguins didn’t show up, but I
thought the booth that they had
for critiquing your resumes was

very helpful,” said Pitt student
Patti Martin. “They gave me a
lot of feedback on how to
improve my resume.”

Other students also took
the opportunity to polish their
resumes at the internship fair.
Bryan Mark, also a Pitt student,
said, “My resume was horrible,
and they told me what I could
do to fix it. That was great.”

The fair gave students the
chance to go face to face with
employers in a less stressful
environment than an interview.
It was designed that way so stu-
dents could talk to potential
employers in a casual atmos-

phere without being nervous.

For Chris Martin, a manag-
er at Northwestern Mutual, the
Internship Fair is also a good
way to get the company name
out. They only take interns who
are interested in future employ-
ment within the company. He
said _the internships they pro-
vide almost always lead to full-
time employment after gradua-
tion.

The fair was scheduled to
be held from 5:30 until 9:30
p.m., yet most all of the busi-
nesses cleared out by 7:45 p.m.
Students showing up after night
classes around 8:00 p.m. were

disappointed to see that every-
one had left already.

“You have to keep in mind
that employers had been in
work all day long; it doesn’t
surprise me that employers
left,” Lee said. _

To make the Internship Fair
even better next year, the dura-
tion may by changed to just a
two—hour long fair, or it may

possibly even be held during.

the day.

“Overall, the fair was pret-
ty good considering it’s the first
one. Hopefully next year we
can grow upon this and make it
even bigger,” Lee concluded.

McDuffie

1989, his position had been changed to
the program’s administrative dean.

For McDuffie, the offices he held
with the Semester at Sea program seem
only natural considering his love of
travel.

“I wanted to study abroad as an
undergraduate,” said McDuffie. “I
wanted to get out of the country.”

After graduating from Gonzaga
University, a Jesuit college in
Washington, McDuffie joined the
Army. A veteran of the Korean War
era, McDuffie used the GI Bill to
obtain his master’s degree, which he
received after study at Middlebury
University and the University of
Madrid in Spain.

“I liked Spanish a lot,” said
McDuffie, who was actually an
English major as an undergraduate.
“My English professors said I went
wrong,” he adds with a chuckle.

After getting his master’s degree,
McDuffie taught Spanish at prep
schools in the East.

“I took part in good [Spanish] pro-
grams, and helped set up programs at
schools that didn’t have them,” said
McDuffie.

McDuffie came to Pitt to get his
Ph.D. in Hispanic Languages and
Literatures. In 1969, after finishing his
degree, he spent seven years teaching
at the University of Montana, where he
-served as president of the Senate of the
Faculty. '

McDuffie returned to Pitt in 1974
as a post—doctoral Mellon Fellow. He

“Ulery is a capitalist idealogue,”
Joseph said. “He works only for the
benefits of business at the University.”
‘The COGS spokespersons said a
union would be more effective than the
GPSA, but Ulery said the union orga-
nizers have jumped to conclusions.
“They claim they can’t_ go to the

chairs are not the bottom line. The bot-
tom line is the Chancellor. There’s

an actor in some college productions.

“I can’t remember the names of
any of the plays,” said McDuffie with
a smile. “It’s been a long time.”

In addition to these activities,
McDuffie was also active in the Alpha
Sigma Nu Jesuit Honor Society, and
helped to form a discussion society for
a handful of students at Gonzaga, enti-
tled “Corps d’Esprit.”

As a writer, McDuffie once did a
study of Gonzaga from a student’s per-
spective, one which he admits was crit-
ical of a number of things about the
University. A

As a faculty member, McDuffie’s
involvement with the University
Senate and Faculty Assembly keeps his
and his colleagues’ voices heard within
the University structure. Now,
McDuffie, along with the input of
other faculty, staff, and students, can
bring suggestions to the administration
that can make a difference in the lives
of those who work and study at Pitt.

“Faculty should be active,” said
McDuffie. “Some argue it has no
power, but the administration does lis-
ten to the senate.”

Though his life has been and still is
busy, McDuffie still made time for a
family. He has two children, Andrew,
who lives in Pittsburgh’s South Side,
and Ann, who lives with her husband
in Seattle.

McDuffie married twice. His sec-
ond wife, Dr. Pamela Bacarisse, was
also a professor in the Hispanic depart-
ment, whom McDuffie, brought here
from Scotland, before they married, to
fill a position in the department. She
died in March of this year.

“I’m not surprised he didn’t hear

Ulery is considering the full implica-
tions of the good a union can do at Pitt.

“I think Ulery lives in a vacuum,”
Joseph said. “We’re talking about
reform in the whole system, the whole
university sytem, and the American
university system in general.”

Barbara White said COGS has
begun to assign varous committees to
investigate the implications of a union
on campus, and are studying how grad
student unions have affected other col-
leges and universities.

She said she thinks there “seems to
be a lot of common good” in--«both

COGS and GPSA and wants both

groups to discuss these issues.

"‘We’d be happy to set up a meet-
ing between the two organizations,”
she said. “The GPSA can do a lot of
good things, and have done so in the
past. But as far as employment issues
are concerned, it’s just not structured
to the problems many of us have.”

Job expo broadens employment horizons

Looking for a job?
Then keep your calendar
open this Thursday, Nov.
14, because the African
American Job Expo ‘96 is
taking place_from 10:30
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the
first ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union.

The job fair, made
possible by the Black
Action Society and the
National Society of Black
Engineers, is for anyone
looking for internships,
part—time or full-time
employment.

“Even if you already

, have a summer, part—time,

or full-time job, this will
broaden your horizons and
present new opportunities
for you,” says Creighton
Moorehead, vice president
of the BAS.

He says the fair is pro-
vided as a service to all
Pitt students, students
from other campuses, and
to people of the surround-
ing community.

“A job fair such as this
one is a great way to meet
prospective employers and
find out where you want to
start your career,” says
Freida Kinney, placement
counselor at the
University of Pittsburgh
Placement Center.

The African American
Job Expo began as an
annual event in 1984 and
has grown significantly
over the last decade, both
in the number of compa-
nies and of students par-
ticipating.

“It started with a
resume book of 50 pages
in ‘84. This year’s book
has 210 pages,”
Moorehead said.

The book facilitates
students’ job searches by
getting their resumes into
prospective employers’
hands. Companies partici-
pating in the expo receive
a copy of the book. Copies
are available for a set
price throughout the year
to any business or organi-
zation requesting informa-
tion on available candi-
dates.

Profit from the book
sales go toward paying for
the BAS senior dinner and
NSBE banquet. Any extra
money goes to the cost of
printing the resume books
and the
involved. The deadline for
submitting a resume for
the book is mid-October.

Moorehead explained
that the expo is for all stu-
dents. “It’s important for
all students to come. A lot
of nationally-based com-
panies attend this fair, so
people who are looking

advertising “

for a job outside of
Pittsburgh have a great
opportunity here.” He
adds that it is not just for
engineers, either. The
recruiters vary from health
care to administrative jus-
tice to the Department of
Public Welfare.

Over 70 companies
and 500 students partici-
pated last year.
Moorehead expects a good
turnout for this year’s
expo as well.

He encourages those
interested in attending the
expo to come to the BAS
office and pick up a stu-
dent -handout on the job
fair. The handout high-
lights how to prepare for
it, and provides a list of
participating companies.
The BAS office is located
on the sixth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union and is
open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5

p.m. ‘

Kinney, at the
University Placement
Center, says the three

most important things stu-
dents can do for the job
fair are to prepare well,
communicate effectively,
and follow up.

She says preparing
well first involves deter-
mining your reason for
attending the fair, and then
considering several types

RECEPTIONIST

A large Assisted Living Facility is currently seeking a mature Receptionist to perform
reception and clerical duties. This individual will be responsible for answering phones,

of career options. Kinney
recommends having a
“game plan.” She says a
good game plan hinges on
making quality contacts.

Communicating effec-
tively entails providing a
prospective employer with
an error-free resume typed
on quality bond paper. It
should be brief and suc-
cinct, highlighting exam-
ples along with personal,
listed skills. “If you have
good interpersonal skills,
then demonstrate it,”
Kinney said.

Carry on a conversa-
tion in which you ask
some questions also. Ask
questions such as: How
does my educational and
work experience fit into
your available positions?
What do you look for in an
ideal candidate? What do
you like about your job?

“It’s extremely impor-
tant to follow up after the
fair is over,” Kinney said.
“Be sure to get the busi-
ness card or name and
phone number of the per-
son you spoke with. Ask
them what is the normal
process in applying for the
position, and when is a
good time to give them a
call. Remember to send a
thank you letter to the
recruiter and reiterate
your interest in their com-

Internship Fair leaves
a lot to be desired

SGB, the CAS Dean’s Office, and the Placement Service
sponsored the Intemship Fair in the William Pitt Union yesterday.
This fair was a great concept, but unfortunately, the actual didn’t
live up to the ideal.

While the free pop was nice and the onion dip was good, the
number of internship possibilities being represented at the fair
was poor. Even the groups that had booths at the fair did not all
have representatives for students to talk with. - ‘

This is not to blame the sponsors of the event because it was
set up and promoted well. The problem was that the people who
could have beneﬁtted from ﬁnding talented young recruits to
intern and work in their companies didn’t seem to care.

Over 300 students showed up, some with resumes in hand,
only to ﬁnd too many booths with nothing more than brochures,
and too small a selection to choose ﬁom.

It would have been a successful event if more companies had
decided to actively solicit student employees rather than act as if
we aren’t worth their time. This is disheartening to the large num-
ber of students at this University who are looking for internships
which will bolster their work experience and hopefully lead to a
job upon graduation. '

We should all appreciate the people who actually did make
an effort in the Internship Fair: those who sponsored the event,’
the companies that not only sent brochures but also representa-
tives to talk with interested students, and the students who took
advantage of the opportunity to check out the fair. If more people
had cared as these people had, the fair would have been a great
success.

Those who didn’t even bother with the fair have only them-
selves to blame for the missed opportunity and the poor showing
they made to the students of this University. _

Hopefully, future fairs will get the respect they deserve from
the job market. Though the resume tips were a great help, it
would have been an even greater experience to have someone to
give your newly polished resume to.

Get a haircut and get a real job

Help! I’m having a separation
anxiety! If things continue to go
according to plan (and my car lives
another year), next semester will be
my last “real” semester at Pitt,
except for a senior seminar and

‘ internship over the summer. At the

beginning of this semester, I talked
to a lot of new freshmen who appar-
ently envied my status as a senior.
Meanwhile, I’m envying them
because they are going to have all
the fun of taking classes, deciding on
a major, making friends, robbing
Peter to pay Paul, and watching the
sunrises and sunsets from our own
ivory, er, I mean, steel and concrete
tower, while improving the quality
of their minds — for the next four
years! While I will be thrown out on
the streets to play grown—ups’
games. I’m really not sure I want to
play.

It’s really here. Time to start on
that resume, start clipping clips for a
portfolio, start looking for — can I
bear to say it? Yes, looking for a
REAL job where one (hopefully)
earns a wage which means you
might just get ahead. A real job.
where you might actually enjoy
what you are doing, might gain self
respect, and feel like a member of
the human race. Where you might
have to, and this is the really bad
part, get up in that unholy part of the
day during which the majority of cit-
izens is apparently pleased to refer to
as “morning,” and might have to
drive in, yech, rush—hour traffic.

But I have one more semester
of academia. Of course, there’s
always graduate school, but my
ﬁnancial situation, I fear, precludes
such indulgences, at least for the
immediate future. I think that one of

the things I am most anxious about
separating ﬁom is the camaraderie
of people who share my situation.
While it’s really not too painful to

write a resume while swapping.

insults with one’s cohorts (“She’s
putting down Grade School Best
Halloween Costume!” and “Just
remember to take it off before the
interview”), it’s quite amusing to
contemplate how exactly the roster
of one’s achievements should be tai-

lored to each different application — .

“Wouldn’t it be funny if we mixed-
up the clips she plans to send to Utne
Reader and the Young Christian
Republicans? Bloody hilarious,
especially when we’re going out to
lunch on your credit card for the sev-
enteenth post-graduate month — oh
yes, I’m free for lunch any day of the
week; yes, call me from your car
phone and pick me up outside the
Light of Life mission —— I’ll be the
one in the grubby raincoat with the
ill-matched socks, sagging around
my unshaven legs. “So what’s up?”
“Oh, still researching that novel, you
know. Yes, I decided a real job was
simply too conﬁning for my cre-
ative genius.”

The search for the mythical real
job is as all-consurning to those of us
in the ranks of the almost—graduated
as the Holy Grail was to knights of
yore. One of the main reasons I had
for going to college was that I want-
ed an interesting job, deﬁned mainly

‘by all the jobs I’ve had and hated

during my varied career which
spans two continents. I just couldn’t
sec working the rest of my life in
some dreary office, some sordid
restaurant, or some freezing factory,
and I have presumed to elevate
myself above the common herd and
demand something better. And so
have all of you reading this.
However, if you are a freshman or a

sophomore, even ‘a junior, all this
remains happily academic. You are
still ensconced in the womb of our
dear alrna mater, and despite hassles

with such tedious details as ﬁnancial .

aid, housing, parking, library ﬁnes,
boolstore return policy, etc., you are
in fact a Lucky Dog, because you
don’t have to leave yet.

But for us seniors, we are about
to undergo the trauma of birth, of
being pushed out into the world to
fend for ourselves, dropped uncere-
moniously into the alleyway of life
like in that Terminator movie. I just
hope I don’t have to steal a pair of
trousers from some broken down
old tramp — because you know that
would have to be extremely ur1hy-
gienic. Yes, I’ve learned all about
those unhygienic primeval life
forms from which we -sprang, (and
have leamed, now, to scrupulously
avoid). I’ve learned about gases and
liquids and pressure and tempera-

ture. I’ve learned about kinetic ener- g

gy andsimple harmonic motion. I
tried to learn about electric circuits
and relativity. I’ve learned about
Mendel and Van Gogh and
Medieval Cathedrals. I’ve leamed
about psychiatric disorders, and
come to think of it, I’ve had a quite
a few of those,‘ too.

So all in all, I can offer both aca-

demic and hands—on experience. So
getting a job shouldn’t be hard at all.
There’s really no need to start acting
like a six-year—old on the ﬁrst day of
school, having separation anxiety.
Nope, it’s time to come out and play
with the big boys. Because if you
don’t, you really will end up on the
streets, having your pants stolen by
time-travelling aliens.
The enigmatic p.r taylor will soon
be selling plasma at a blood bank
near you. The real world is a harsh
place, folks.

Third parties are good for everyone, even Democrats

 

According to national polls, about 60
percent of the American people like the idea
ofathirdparty, andlagree. IamaDemocrat,
and I will always be a Democrat, but I am an
American ﬁrst and foremost. I think that a
third party would be good for America. We
live today in a system of 83,0()0 county, city,
state, and federal governments and other sub-
divisions. A third-party system would give
the lazy and complacent Democratic-
Republican monopoly (the oldest political
system in the world) a jolt, and it would give
the American people a real outlet for their
anger and a real chance for change.

Now, I kr1ow some people might be say-

ing: “Why not Ross Perot? Did he not form
a third party called the Reform Party that’s
supposed to be a viable alternative to the two-

party system?” The answer is no. The

Reform Party is a sony excuse for a third
party. Here’s why:

Following the 1992 election, Ross Perot
was at the mnith of his power and probably
the most-feared man in Washington D.C.
Politicians desperately kowtowed to him to
win his favor. The political establishment
had, for the ﬁrst time in a long time, a gen-
uine reason to be afraid. However, Perot

decided instead to commit his energy to
making himself a nuisance in Washington,
unsuccessfully ﬁghting the president’s coura-
geous I993 budget and NAFTA. His infa-
mous debate with Vrce-President Gore on
Larry King Live showed him to be little more
than a petty, tl1in—skinned tyrant. Instead of
ﬁghting for change, Perot had become an
obstacle to reform. The public mostly desert-
ed him. A

Then in 1995, Perot appeared on Larry
King Live and armounced the formation of
the Reform Party, which Perot vigorously
claimed would not simply be a vehicle for his
own ambitions. Former Colorado Governor
Richard Lamm, distraught at the inability of
the Democratic and Republican parties to
reform the entitlement system, announced
his intention to rrm for the Reform Party’s
1996 nomination for president. “Never,”
Lamm said in his armouncement» speech,
“has a generation so pre-spent their children’s
money as my generation.” \Vrthin 36 hours
of Lamm’s announcement, Perot went back
on Larry King live (surprise, surprise) and
armounced his intention to run for the
Reform Party nomination as well. The race
was on.

The Reform Party had a two-tier nomi-
nating process. In July, ballots went out to
979,882 Reform Party members across the

United States. Anyone who received more
than 10 percent of the vote would go on to
the party’s second round of voting, and the
wirmer would be announced on August 18 in
Valley Forge, Pa. Perot defeated Lamm more
than two—to-one in the ﬁrst round, but less
than 10 percent of the ballots were sent back.
That’s right —- over 900,000 Reform Party
members did not even vote!

Unsurprisingly, Perot won the second
round of voting as well, but there were some
serious problems with the balloting. For
round two, an extra 250,000 ballots were sent
out (the Reform Party had gained, mysteri-
ously, another quarter-million new mem-
bers). Over half of the ballots returned were
dazlared invalid for one reason or another.
Larmn had to call Perot himself seven times
before he received his own ballot, and
Reform Party organizers refused to give
Lamm a list of party members until it was too
late for Lamm to send out his campaign lit-
erature. Larnrn was disgusted by the dirty
tricks Perotusedtobeathimandrefusedto
endorse the Texan for president. “I will
endorse Ross Perot as Paul Revere; I will
endorse him as prescient. But I will not
endorse him as president”

It’s a shame too. Perot had a golden
opportunity to form a third party following
the 1992 election, when nearly 20 million

Americans cast ballots for the maverick, self-
made billionaire. Perot won his Pyrrhic vic-
tory over Lamm but ended up losing the war.
Faced with the fact that his party was a sham,
and thanks to revelations by former Perot
employees that painted their boss as a para-
noid nut obsessed with secrecy, the American
people passed Ross by in 1996, giving him
about 8 percent of the vote. less than half of
his voters in 1992 retumed to him in 1996.

The Reform Party has become little
more than Ross Perot’s personal playpen, a
forum where he can indulge his ego in front
of thousands of willing supporters who will
follow their leader to the ends of the earth
without question. The American people were
right to pass him by in 1996 and to re—elect
President Clinton, who has fought for real
change, but I hope Perot’s failure will not dis-
courage other candidates who would seek to
challenge the traditional political establish-
ment. Thomas Jefferson remarked that,
“Each generation has the right to choose for
itself the form of government it believes most
promotive of its own happiness.” I would
advise everyone to take a look for alterna-
tives to the established order in 1998 and
beyond. Just don’t look at Ross Perot to
deliver that change.
Michael Berquist is hoping for some change
to a system that needs it.

Why in the heckdid Generation X vote for Bill Clinton?

 

I am absolutely ashamed,
appalled, and disgusted with my
generational peers. Again, the 18
to 35-year-olds have cast their bal-
lots for Bill Clinton. In 1992,
many political pundits believed
that Generation Xers were respon-

sible for electing Clinton. My gen-

eration voted for Clinton on the
premise that he was bringing
“change” to government and that
he would ensure that our govem-
ment be prepared for the next rr1il—
lenniurn.

While Clinton and his sup-
porters point at certain areas in
which government works better
(and in some cases, this is true),
we still have a dying patient on the
table — our federal government
— and our president has made no

3 efforts to stop the bleeding. We’re

only repairing the patient’s' broken
pinkie toe and ignoring the stake
in its chest.

Yes, the deﬁcit has been cut
63 percent. Meanwhile, Clinton’s
own budget reports predict an
ever-increasing deﬁcit after he
leaves oﬂice. By the year 2030,
we’ll have a $4.1 trillion deﬁcit
(keep in mind that our national

-- debt — our accumulated deﬁcits

— is only $5.3 trillion today). This
is a burden that Bill Clinton will
never have to manage. It will be
on my generation’s shoulders.
Yes, government overhead
has been trirmned. But govern-
ment operations only account for a
small sliver of our govemment’s
budget —-—— about nine-tenths of 1

percent of the federal budget, if .
you want‘ to get technical. We

need to get serious if we want to
balance the budget. We waste our
time with discussions on cutting
aid to schools, reducing environ-
mental protections, and slashing
aid to farms. Education and train-
ing services occupy only about
three percent of our federal bud-
get, environmental protection gets
1.5 percent, and agriculture
accounts for 0.6 percent.

No major elected official has
touched the third rail of politics:
entitlements. Can you blame
them? Our deﬁcit will amount to
about $110 billion next year, or
about 8 percent of federal spend-
ing. If we need to permanently cut
8 percent of our budget in order to
balance it, we need to begin look-
ing at the largest area —— and
largest growing area — of spend-
ing: entitlements, where our gov-
ernment spends 57 percent of its
$1.519 trillion budget.

Our entitlement programs are
large now, but what’s ﬁightening
is that they are projected to grow
exponentially into the next centu-
ry. While we may not want to cut
beneﬁts already promised, we
must rethink our programs for the
next generation. If we cut tiny pro-

grams that will hurt our country,’

we may temporarily balance the
budget. No one talks about this.
I’m still waiting for the discus-
sions to get serious. I seriously
doubt any current politicians will
stop the runaway growth of enti-
tlement programs. It will be my
generation that will have to deal
with it.

The current administration
gave us the largest tax increase in
history.) And a child born today
will pay an 82 percent-tax rate,
according to page 25 of Clinton’s
own 1995 budget‘ report. We’re
building a bridge into the 21st cen-
tury, but We’re borrowing the
money to pay for it at the expense
of my generation and the next.

Trade deals with Mexico
have sent thousands and thou-
sands of jobs across the border.
The creators of the North
American Free Trade Agreement
promised a trade surplus with
Mexico, but we’ve accumulated
$70 million in trade deﬁcits with

Mexico since NAFTA’s inception.
My generation worries about the
environment, and NAFTA dealt a
giant blow to enviromnental pro-
tection in the south by loosening
environmental controls in
Mexico. Pollutants stream across
to the United States via the
northerly air currents that blow
ﬁom Mexico into the U.S. When
my peers graduate from college,
will they need to move to another
country to ﬁnd a job?

And, I feel the need to men-
tion campaign ﬁnancing as well.
Clinton’s campaign and the
Democratic Party have accepted
millions in illegal campaign con-
tributions (and the Republicans
certainly aren’t innocent either). In
1995, Clinton shook hands with
Newt Gingrich, and they
promised us we would receive
real campaign finance reform.
Instead, all efforts were stiﬂed.
Now, after Clinton’s illegal prac-
tices have been exposed, he has
called for the refonn again. Will
we get it? Any bookkeeper will
give you odds against it/happen-
mg. a

My generation will owe more
thanany other in American histo-
ry. Already, each individual’s
share of the national debt is
$20,000 —— enough to by a nice

car for every American citizen.
We don’t have much to show for
that expense. According to gov-
ernment reports, our government
ofﬁcially has a negative net worth
— and negative to the tune of
$2.983 trillion. Unoﬁicially, when
you add Social Security, federal
pension liabilities, and other gov-
ernment “promises,” the United
States Govemment has between a
$14 trillion and $17 trillion nega-
tive net worth. This is the largest
bankruptcy man has ever seen.
Yet my generation votes for

the guy who eats Big Macs and .

plays the saxophone. It’s no won-
der politicians will not take my
generation seriously. We vote for
the superﬁcial and ignore the seri-
ous.

Fellow Generation Xers, you

now know what you got for your '

vote. Was it a fair exchange? I

hope all of you think long and Q

hard about that question.

The gods must
be crazy

 

.When Mike Tyson became human
last weekend, the sport of boxing was
brought back from sideshow status into
the three-ring circus of sporting events.

And, in the center ring, Evander
Holyfield has captured the hearts,
minds, and future pay-per—view dollars
of the pugilist-loving populace.

In his ﬁrst few moments in the
spotlight, Commander Vander did what
might come natural to many of us — he
thanked God for the strength to attain
his goal of a third title reign.

Then, he thanked God again.

Then, again. And again. By the
time he was ﬁnished, half of the press
gallery was probably looking for the
offering plate and ﬂipping pages in the
media guide to find the words to the
post—sermon benediction.

Tyson was too busy figuring out
where he was to deliver a speech, but
he did praise Allah for getting him
through the toughest night of his life.
The only major player in this event that
didn’t mention a supreme being was
Don King, which came as a shock to
nobody.

While these two heavyweights are
more vocal than some, most boxers
give thanks to some divinity after their
match is over. Fighters don’t quite get
the irony here of two grown men
attempting‘ to knock each other’s heads
off for millions of dollars then immedi-
ately tuming into televangelists the sec-
ond the ﬁnal bell rings. It’s kind of like
a vegetarian working the day shift at a
meat-packing plant.

Holyfield, like George Foreman
before him, even made an appearance
on The 700 Club before the ﬁght. Pat
Robertson wished him the best of luck.
I doubt equal air—time was offered to
Tyson.

Other than his appearance with Mr.
Robertson, very few of Holyf1eld’s reli-
gious statements have made the news-

There are athletes of exceptional
ability and skill who come along on
rare occasion. Players capable of enter-

ing a situation and quickly adapting to ,

that environment to better his or her
team. Pitt volleyball setter Stephanie
Dufresne is one of those individuals.
When Yankees’ first baseman
Wally Pipp went down with an injury,
the Yanks had no choice but to go to
rookie infielder Lou Gehrig. Who
knew .Pipp’s days as a starter would
come to an end that afternoon. Gehrig,

the original “Iron Man,” went on to A

play 3,140 consecutive games.

In 1981, Baltimore Orioles’ short-
stop Cal Ripken replaced Doug
Dascenzo at shortstop and never
looked back, passing Gehrig’s streak.
The future Hall of Famer hasn’t missed
a game since.

Pitt Head Coach Cindy Alvear
watched as starting setter Annemarie
Memagh went down prior to the start
of the 1994 volleyball campaign.
Knowing Memagh was a question
mark to start the season, Alvear turned
to the only answer — Dufresne.

“Since Annemarie was hurt, I
started the preseason,” said the
Canadian native. “Two weeks before

Alvear and the Panther volleyball program since day one.

going to be the starter. That got me
very nervous, because I hadn’t yet
begun to understand the game here.”

Dufresne, born in Montreal on
March 14, 1974, did what came natu-
rally: she worked hard, adjusted to the
new plays, and eventually made the
full transition.

“I got through the whole month of

September,” Dufresne explained, ”and
then Annemarie was healthy again. By
then it was too late, because I already
had developed a good feeling with the
team. It wasn’t planned, but it turned
out to be that way.”

The 5—foot—l0 senior hadn’t initial-
ly planned on playing volleyball either.

Big changes

 M k

There will be a new look this sea-
son for the Pitt men’s and women’s
track teams this season. Several high-
quality athletes graduated, leaving
things a little bit different than they
were last year — particularly for the
men. ‘

An inordinately large number of
graduates from last year’s men’s team
were sprinters. That means that sprint-
ers won’t be scoring all of the team’s
points anymore.

“The team will have a balance that
we have not had over the past couple
of years,” said Head Coach Steve
Lewis. “We will be stronger as a team.
We should be successful in areas that
we weren’t as successful in last year.”

One of the biggest changes since
last year is in the men’s jumping
events. A trio of freshmen,‘ Bryan
Johnson, Brian Richard, and Stacy
Ruffer, have joined the team to com-
pete in events in which Pitt didn’t
have any regular participants last sea-
son. ’

“We didn’t score a point in jump-
ing events last year. Our jumping will
be very strong this year,” Lewis said.

 

are on track for Panthers

ie Martin is one of the many
Panthers returning in 96-97.

An
La

The core of last year’s hurdling
crew, including senior captains Orrel
Green and Jerel Williams, returns. The
team should also be strong in middle
distance events, led by senior captains
Ed Adamson and Matt Samuel.

The team’s other captain is senior
Ron Losiewicz. Losiewicz is recov-
ered from injuries that plagued him
last season and is ready to compete in
the throws.

The women are now without All-
American Najuma Fletcher, who can
be found these days on Pitt’s coaching
staff.

“I don’t think in terms of replac-
ing and losing,” Lewis said. “Losing
people to graduation is a poor excuse
for not doing as well as the year
before.”

The women’s team is still loaded
with athletes who can perform in sev-
eral events.’ Senior captains Shana
Fadis and Jennifer Williams lead that
group, which includes fifth-year
senior Megan Ferrara and sophomores
Trecia Smith and Naeemah Withey.

The middle distances will be han-
dled by senior captain Angie Martin
and junior Anna Kohler. Pitt’s fourth
women’s captain is senior distance
'runner Stephanie Ellsworth.

“This year’s team will have a dif-
ferent look,” Lewis said. “I’m excited
about the development and cohesive-
ness that this team is demonstrating
now.” '

The first competition of the
Panthers’ season is this Saturday’s
Blue Gold intrasquad meet. The ﬁeld
events start at 10 a.m. at the Cost
Center. The track events follow at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Big East coaches
speak their minds

%Mike Kovak

Boston College senior Danya
Abrams has been chosen as the 1996-
97 Big East Preseason Player of the
Year by a vote of the league’s head
coaches. The Charles Barkley—esque
power forward is the first Boston
College player in Big Easthistory to
receive Preseason Playerof the Year
honors.

The 6—foot-7, 265—pound Abrams
averaged 19.6 points and 9.6
rebounds last season for the Eagles
while earning All-Big East honors for
the second consecutive season. He
ranked sixth overall in conference

scoring and second in rebounds. In

conference play, Abrams led the Big
East with 10.1 boards a game.

Abrams is joined on the 1996-97
All-Big East first team by two
Villanova seniors, Jason Lawson and
Alvin Williams. Also on the first
team are senior Austin Croshere of
Providence and junior sensation
Zendon Hamilton of St. John’s,
Lawson and Hamilton were second
team all—conference picks last season,
and Croshere earned third team hon-
ors. .

In each of their first three sea-
sons, Lawson and Williams have led
the Wildcats to top 10 finishes in the
‘AP poll. Last year, Lawson averaged
12.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. But

more importantly, Lawson is a defen—_

sive intimidator. His 3.] blocks per
game mark last year led the confer-
ence. Lawson. was named a Playboy
All—American for this season.
Williams scored at an 11.0 clip last

 

season and dealt 177 assists.

Croshere averaged a team-high
15.3 points for the Friars last year
and took down 5.8 boards per con-
test. Hamilton emerged as one of the
conference’s best players last season,
officially waving goodbye to the
shadow cast by the over-hyped Felipe
Lopez. He averaged 20.8 points and
10.3 rebounds. _

Underclassmen dominate the sec-
ond All-Big East team. Syracuse cen-
ter Otis Hill, is the only senior. Hill is
joined on the second team by team-
mate Todd Burgan, who emerged dur-
ing last year’s NCAA tournament.
Joining the two Orangemen are
junior forwards Pat Garrity of Notre
Dame and Damian Owens of West
Virginia. A

Last year’s Big East freshman of
the year, James “Scoonie” Penn and
Victor Page of Georgetown round out
the second team.

Vi1lanova’s Tim Thomas replaces
Pitt’s Vonteego Cummings as
Preseason Rookie of the Year.
Thomas could have turned pro this
year, but they6-foot-9 freshman for-
ward chose to play for Steve “Rat
Boy” Lappas. ,

The coaches also selected places
in the Big East divisions. Pitt is slat-
ed to finish fifth in the Big East 7
division. Syracuse ‘is scheduled to
win the BE7. Behind them are

Providence, Georgetown, Miami,

Pitt, Seton Hall, and Rutgers.
Coaches think Villanova will run
away with the Big East 6 division.
They should be followed by Boston
College, Connecticut, St. John’s,
West Virginia, and Notre Dame.

Dufresne

You can thank her big sister for that.
“When I was 12 years old, I began

- in synchronized swimming at first, “

said Dufresne. “[My sister] had started
synchronized swimming too  that’s
why I went into it.”

Following their younger years in
the pool, Stephanie followed in the
footsteps of ' her sibling, eventually
making the transition to the hard court.

“In high school,” she said, “my
sister was playing volleyball already,
and said to give it a try. I tried it for a
year  I decided I liked volleyball bet-
ter because of the
team sport aspect.”

Because of her
height at the time,
Dufresne played
middle hitter. As she
got older, her
growth in height
stagnated, prompt-
ing a change of posi-
tion.

“When I was 16
or 17 _and started
playing very seri- '
ously at home,” said Dufresne, ”they
told me if I switched to setter I’d be
able to go further based on my size
and the fact that I couldn’t swing as
hard as the other hitters. It was a tough
switch at first. The setter is apart from
the rest of the squa .”

Dufresne settled in at her new
position and eventually moved on to
the University of Montreal as a fresh-
man. She had played volleyball the
past two years in CEGEP — a “pre—
college program” — wiping out the
competition. It was after her first year
at Montreal that she would face her
next obstacle.

“There were rumors that the vol-
leyball program was going to be cut,”
she explained. “Our coach told us that
if we still wanted to play, we should
start looking elsewhere to transfer.”

After months of research and vis-
iting schools, Dufresne finally ended
up taking a scholarship to come to Pitt
in 1994.

“I had went to Florida the week
before and really didn’t like it,” the
Pitt setter said. “Then I came here dur-
ing Spring Break  I had other offers,
but I didn’t have time to ask them to
wait two or three weeks. I really liked
[Pitt’s] program, the girls, and coaches
 so I chose Pitt.”

With a language barrier and quick-
er play on the court to deal with in the
United States, Dufresne said she
wouldn’t have made it through her
first Panther season if it weren’t for
‘94 team captain Carrie Thornton.

“Every time I had a problem I
called her,” said Dufresne. “She was
always available. We used to go to the
coffee shops every time I had lost it.
She was really good to me.”

The sophomore transfer finished

 

 

her first Panther season with a team-
high 41 aces and 1,271 assists en route
to a 21-11 season. Pitt won the Big
East title for the seventh straight sea-
son in 1994 ‘and Dufresne was named
to the All—Big East second-team.

As the end of her third season
winds down, Dufresne has met much
success at the University of
Pittsburgh. The 1995 AVCA District
One selection and 1995 Big East sec-
ond—teamer led the conference in
assists per—game (13.25).

While leading the 1996 squad in

attack percentage
(.346), aces (32) and
assists (1,239),

Dufresne is again on
pace to lead the Big
East with 12.79
assists-per-game this
season.
“Statistically,
this has been a great
season,” said
Dufresne. ”The play-
ers are so good 
 even when we play
bad we can still win. If you look at our
potential, we could still playbetter. In
the next two weeks, we need to raise

. our level to, challenge for the [Big

East] tournament. If - everybody
believes in it as much and Jennie and I
do, and everyone could understand
what it feels like when you’re a senior,
we’d be awesome every day.”

papers. Quotations in post-fight reports
centered mainly on the two or three
passages the new champ uttered which
did not have anything to do with
Christianity. Tyson’s Muslim faith was-
n’t addressed by anybody.

Sportswriters have a natural aver-
sion to religion, especially when more
than one is involved in the same story.
This makes sense — writing that a man
who draws his strength from Allah got
knocked out in the eleventh by another
man who draws his strength from Jesus
Christ is bound to irritate, confuse, and
provoke a few letters.

Obviously, that kind of characteri-
zation isn’t the best way to attack this
issue. Still, it has to be addressed when
you consider how important religion is
to these two fighters and many other
members of the sports world.

Holyfield believes that his heart
condition was cured by a faith healer.
Amazed doctors, while not publicly
agreeing with him, haven’t come up
with a better answer. If Tyson didn’t
ﬁnd religion in prison, he could very
well have gone right back.

Holyfield said publicly, before and
after the fight, that God had already
made it quite clear that he was going to
win. Asked whether he would agree to a
rematch, he told a TV reporter that it
was up to Jesus Christ. While reporters
speculated in print whether or not
Tyson-Holyﬁeld II was imminent, that

 

 

 mom PAGE 9 

quote never saw the sports pages.

For some reason, “Touchdown
Jesus” is fine, but when anybody else
mentions religion, you can forget it. If
Tyson or Holyfield had been driven to
perform by poverty, revenge, or a sick
grandmother, it would have been the
lead story of every newspaper in the
country — God/Allah/Buddha/etc. just
doesn’t cut it as a motivation, I guess.

Put simply, if the heavyweight
champion of the world strongly
believes that his spiritual strength is
what made him what he is, then some-
body better say something about it.
Boxing writers can dwell on slipped
jabs, counterpunches, and inadvertent
headbutts for as long as they want, but
if Evander says God helped, somebody
ought to print it.

If Mike Tyson says Allah helped,‘

somebody ought to print it.

If some other boxer says any kind
of person, place, thing, or divine being
helped, then somebody ought to print it.
If a belief is strong in the individual, it
becomes a necessary part of the story.

And speaking of Touchdown Jesus,‘
let’s hope the Panthers hit the cathe-
dral/church/synagogue/mosque/gather-
ing place of their choice a few times
before Saturday. Never let it be said that
Pitt doesn’t have a prayer against Notre
Dame.
