If you travelled the Boulevard of the Allies
between Seneca Street in Soho and Craft
Avenue to Oakland this morning and plan
on using the same route later today, forget it.

PennDOT closed that stretch of the
Boulevard after this morning’s rush hour.
The 44,000 people who travel to Pitt, area
hospitals and other colleges each day and the
thousands more who pass through the Oak-
land area will be faced with yet another road
repair project.

Commuters on Western Pennsylvania’s

most heavily travelled highway are being
introduced to Phase I of a two-year, $35.3
million PennDOT project that will cap a
nine-year plan to rebuild the Parkway East.
Phase I will close three Boulevard ramps
from February to mid-June.

Pitt commuters, who represent 87 percent
of the university’s enrollment, and others
working in Oakland who travel the Boule-
vard inbound will have to follow several
detours.

“People are going to be driving through
parking lots and backyards trying to find
alternatives [to the" closing]," predicted Jay
Roling, Pitt’s assistant to the vice-chancellor
for public affairs. Roling is also the univer-
sity representative to the community group

The Oakland- ramp on the Parkway East
will remain open until July when PennDOT
plans another surprise: closing the entire
eastbound side of the Parkway from Stan-

bound side will be altered to allow one lane
of eastbound traffic. Motorists will enter the
Parkway East by the inbound Grant Street
exit, which will be converted to handle out-
bound traffic.

By September, Roling said it may be
necessary to reschedule some classes to
reduce the number of days students will

State
budgetto
include hike
for Pitt

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

Pennsylvania governor Richard Thorn-
burgh yesterday unveiled his 1984-85 budget
proposal, which includes an increase of $5.7
million in state appropriations to Pitt aswell
as increases to other universities in the
commonwealth. -

Thornburgh recommended an $87.13 mil-
lion appropriation to Pitt, a 7 percent
increase over the budget appropriation of
fiscal year l984, $79.7 million. The increase
in funding between 1982-83 and last year
was 4 percent.

The university had made a request for a
16.4 percent increase in state
appropriations. I

Senior Vice-Chancellor for Administra-
tion Jack Freeman said he could not project
at this time whether this appropriation
would result in a tuition increase for the term
beginning in September. e

“Our commonwealth appropriation
represents less than one third of our total

budget” Freeman said. Other funding  9

considered include tuition and fees,‘federa‘l
and private research grants, private contri-

' butions, -contracts and endowments. . - 

“Each facet of our budget will be analyzed-
prior to the presentation of our fiscal year
1985 proposal to the board of trustees early
this summer,” Freeman said. 5

“We recognize the economic position of

' the commonwealth, and consider the $5.7

million increase in our appropriation pro-
posed by Governor Thornburgh a clear
statement of his commitment to strengthen-
ing higher education,” Pitt chancelloi Wes-
ley Posvar said. r

The governor's proposed 7 percent
increase in funding to higher education
would mean an additional $55 million in
state money to be divided among the 14
state-owned universities, four state-related
schools (including Pitt) and 14 community
colleges. ” 

“We recognize that each of us has a
responsibility to share in and contribute to
the economic resurgence of Pennsylvania,”
Posvar said.

“The. University of Pittsburgh has main?

tained an austere budget over the past
decade and will continue to do so for the
foreseable future. Our goal is to continue to
make high-quality education available at a
reasonable cost to qualified students, partic-
ularly Pennsylvanians.”

The governor’s proposal also would
include a_ 7 percent increase in the budget of
the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assist-
ance Agency, the primary source of financial
aid for the state-resident students.

Thornburgh’s budget also calls for fund-
ing of $20 million for the Ben Franklin Part-
nership Program —— a joint industry-
government-academic program —— in which

Two Pitt professors plan to testify
before the City Council at a public
hearing later this month that Mayor
Richard Caliguiri’s report on the
impact of military spending on the
City of Pittsburgh should be redone.

Robert Norman, associate profes-
sor in the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs (GSPIA)
and representative for Jobs With

S Peace (J WP), called the report “a

fraud and a sham." Pitt professor of
economics and JWP representative
‘David Houston agreed and called
the report, “inaccurate and incom-
plete.” Houston said he plans to
present an alternative report on the
economic impact of military spend-
ing on Pittsburgh to City Council.
He explained he will do so “not to
compete with the mayor's office,
though we would win such a compe-
tition hands down, but to show that
an accurate study could be done
without too much expense."

The report was the result of a
November 1982 ballot referendum
proposed by City Council. Council's
call for a referendum overrode
Mayor Caliguiri‘s veto. Pitts-

burghers voted 2 to 1 to amend the ‘

Home Rule Charter to require the

of regular um drmti

Mayor’s defense report Called ‘Sham’

mayor to present a report on the
economic impact of military spend-
ing on Pittsburgh annually, making
those results public.

According to the charter, the

report must include an account of.

the taxes Pittsburghers pay to the
federal government per capita and in
total and an analysis ofthe impact of
the military budget on the city's
economy in relation to jobs and
social services.

This amendment was sponsored
by JWP, a national organization
that argues that defense dollars
would be better spent on creating
private sector jobs. It has sponsored
similar referendums in over 50 U.S.
cities, but only in Pittsburgh and
Baltimore have binding amend-
ments been passed.

“If the mayor says military spend-
ing hurts the local economy, people
believe it," local J WP representative
Joe Hughes said. The mayor's
report, however, concluded that
“the city seems to receive in defense
contracts and spending more than
its residents send to the federal
government for defense.”

According to the report: a little
over 25 percent of Pittsburghers’

income tax payments go for military,

spending. $140,314,000 of the
$545,969,000 Pittsburghers paid in
federal income tax in l982 went for
military spending. The Defense

‘Just because the $558
million check goes to
Westinghouse Corpo-
rate headquarters
downtown, doesn’t
mean the money is
spent in Pittsburgh’
-David Houston

Department awarded contracts to
the city totalling $601,736,000 and
there appears to be a positive impact
for the city in the amount of
$461,422,000.

Westinghouse Electric Corp,

which has a defense contract of
$558,127,000, received 92 percent of
all the federal defense money
awarded to Pittsburgh firms. The
remainder of the military spending
in the city, slightly over $33,000,000,
was divided among 138 other firms
and institutions.

“It doesn’t take an expert to see
that the report doesn’t even mention
jobs or social services," Norman
said. '

 

The report cites the benefits of
defense contracts which are not
clearly within city boundaries and its
estimate of how much of Pitts-
burgh’s tax money goes for the mil-
itary budget is too low, Houston
said.

“Just because the $558 million
check goes to the Westinghouse
Coiporate headquarters downtown
doesn't mean the money is spent in
Pittsburgh. The money could go to
any of the Westinghouse plants all
around the country,” Houston said.

The Pittsburgh Westinghouse
Defense Group public relations
manager Tom Duncan said in 1982
Westinghouse received contracts
that totaled less than $10 million for
the entire state of Pennsylvania.

“I don’t know where in the world
those numbers came from," Duncan
said, referring to the report’s calcu-
lations. “A few administrative types
push paper around here, but
nowhere near $558 million is spent,"

. Duncan said. He added that 99 per-

cent of Westinghouse‘s defense busi-
ness is in Baltimore.

Senior Internal Auditor for the
City Department of Finance Marion
Wise said she and the city treasurer
got the report’s data from “pub-
lished facts" sent to them by the
Defense Department. Someone in
the Defense Department had

assured her that all the contract’s
work is performed in the city, Wise
said.

Wise refused to answer why the
report does'not analyze the impact
of military spending on cityjobs and
social services.

Pitt professor ofeconomics Frank
Giarratani declined to comment on
the mayor’s report, saying he had
not read it. The report is “next to
impossible" to do well with existing
data, he said.

He called the report “a political
football."

“The city should never have got-
ten involved with a situation that
just left them up the, creek."

Houston said that the precise eco-
nomic impact of military spending
on the city would be difficult to
measure.

“Part of the money goes to buy
steel, part of the money goes to buy
dinners for visiting architects. If the
architects have dinner at Station
Square, then the money creates jobs
for the waiters, but you still have to
measure how much goes for what,"
he said.

“But there must be a middle
ground between a couple-of-
hundred-thousand dollars
and some back-of—the envelope cal-
culations,” Houston said.

President Reagan’s stationing of U.S. Marines in Lebanon 4- ‘lg  in 11”’ ‘L1 ‘ '2' 1  :
has turned into a 1t 1 ' ~ it  ‘ ’T-’  ‘P
po 1 ica quagmire. /, .,I . HE“;

Reagan “now is only waiting for the most politically expe-

dient moment to pull out our troops. This is the same faulty 4

rationale used by former-President Richard Nixon that caused
the unneccesary deaths of thousands of'Americansin Vietnam,

‘ well after it was clear that the U.S. cause was hopeless.

The inquiry into the bombing ofthe Marine base pointed out
the lack of Reagan’s policy in the area. There seemed to be no
clear recognition by the Reagan planners that placing the
Marines on the ﬂat airstrip would make them sitting ducks for

just such an attack. The inquiry showed that the only policy in

effect was to show U.S. muscle without giving the Marines any
clear idea of what they were sent to-accomplish.

I.n the latest developments of Beirut, the U.S. yesterday
ordered all “non-essential and dependant” persons out of Bei-
rut. Thisfollowed the resignation of the Lebanese cabinet and ~
prime minister and the near-total collapse of the current
government of President Amin Gemayel.

Observers in the city have said the only sections the anti-
government forces haven’t taken are those they don’t particu-
larly want. _  .

Some questions remain. What is the mission of the U.S.
troops in Beirut, and why have over 250 Americans been sent to
die, when no official policy has been established? It would
appear that as peace keepers, we’ve failed. . '

To allow the sensless slaughter of Americans in Beirut is
intolerable. President Reagan must realize that no matter how
well-intentioned the peace keeping forces may have been, it
hasn’t worked. The lives of American soldiers should not be
traded for a few extra points in the electoral college.

Dubious Report

lt’s been three years since President Reagan spoke.ofinfus- “
ing over $1 trillion into the nation’s defenseprogram over a
five-year period. With such a monetary figure to work with,
now in the third fiscal year, it is assumed the dollars are being
spent to further ‘Americans’ best interests, domestically and
abroad. ‘ ’

In the Pittsburgh area, nothing is further from thetruth. Two
years ago, city residents amended the Home Rule Charter to
require the mayor to present an annual report that analyzes the
impact of military spending on jobs and social services in
metropolitan Pittsburgh. The issue carries with it complicated
and controversial questions. i

Recently Mayor Caliguiri presented the annual report,

 which must weigh defense contracts awarded Pittsburgh indus-

try and an estimate of what residents pay Uncle”Sam in taxes.
The difference between taxes and contracts, this year’s report
concludes, “seems to [have] a positive impact on the city in the
amount of $461,422,000." Furthermore, the report shows
Westinghouse received 92 percent of all federal defense monies
awarded Pittsburgh firms.

At best,. Caliguiri’s latest report smells of deception.
Nowhere within does it mention what impact Washington's
dollars have on employment in t-he private sector or on Pitts-
burgh’s social services. Additionally, money awarded Westing-
house is “trickled down” in its plants throughout the country.

And there are those versed in pure economics who presently
contend that many of the report’s figures are inaccurate and
misleading.

Caliguiri’s latest attempt to estimate the impact of defense
spending on Pittsburgh potentially sets an unhealthy precedent
for future reports. Competence is sorely needed for ‘analyzing
the use of vast amounts of money that cannot be channeled any
which way. This is not lunch money that’s at ‘stake. National
interests all the way down to the local level depend on pinpoint
accuracy in the national security realm.

 Cheering on

mediocrity  

You have finally convinced me
that The Pitt News is definitelyjour-
neying in the realms of mediocrity.
The recent story about George
Allen’s being out late at night before
the Boston College game was total
gossip. I mean, who cares if George
was outthe night before the game -—
maybe Coach Chipman but cer-
tainly not me. It is no surprise that
you printed such a story. It seems as
though you are only in t_he business
to fill your newspaper withjunk sto-
ries. Let‘s be real. You were really
digging for a story when you printed
the story about George Allen. The
next thing Itknow you will be taking

pot shots at the cheerleaders or

SGB. Or,have I seen that before?
It is to my understanding that the
s6le purpose of a newspaper is to
report the news, not gossip, which
you continue to print in order to fill
pages. If I wanted _gossip, I would

t read the National Enquirer.

Let’s also ‘give credit where credit
is due. The cheerleaders have finally
gained the respect that they have
fought so hard to gain. The crowd is
cheering with the cheerleaders de-
spite the absence of Tiger Paul, who,
in my opinion, cannot be replaced
by anyone. Sure, I thin-k that he was
great for the school, but he is not
here to cheer for Pitt. ‘

It is time that you wake up and
become responsible journalists.
Write news stories for a change.
Sure, you can take pot shots at the
cheerleaders or print gossip stories
about athletes, but it is your image
that you are ruining. -

We are pleased to see The Pitt

Moral look '
at president

It was with disappointment that I
read The Pitt News on Monday,
Jan. 30. The reason for my disap-
pointment was the somewhat moral-
izing tone of the letter by Ronald
Hoptadefending Reagan or, as it
claimed to be, defending the office of
the president of the United States.

Suffice to say, if the majority
elected Reagan, then let that major-
ity sing his praises. Do not, however,
deny the supposed minority the right
to voice their opinions, particularly

, in a letter which goes on to mention

how freedom of choice is fundamen-
tal to our form of government. This
is also true for freedom of expres-
sion and the principle of loyal
dissent.

As for Reagan’s “beating down"
inﬂation and reducing unemploy-
ment, any first-year statistician
could tell you that numbers can be
made to appear to say anything.

Campus Concerns/ Mindy Goldberg

Solving the internship problem

Whatever happened to the intern-
ship office? Last April, when stu-
dents were busy studying for final
exams, the Office of Student Affairs
quietly eliminated the full-time
internship office as one of their stu-
dent services. Just as quietly, the
Office of the Provost picked up the
program on a part-time basis. Cur-
rently the office is only open two and
one-half days per week and is staffed
by just one graduate assistant.

The internship office offers an
essential service to students. In this
era when a liberal arts graduate is
often hard-pressed to find a job, an
internship in their chosen field of
study offers them hands—on expe-
rience. This experience makes stu-
dents more appealing to companies
while at the same time adding
another dimension to their educa-
tion experience.

Not only are internships valuable
to students, but they are valuable to
the university as well. Internships

provide an important rapport with
the corporate community. In some
instances, research funds were made
available to faculty through the con-
tacts made. Finally, the university
receives increased tuition revenues
when students pay for the credits of
a summer internship, when they

normally would not have enrolled in ~

classes.

The current part-time status ofthe-
internship office is inadequate. Dur-
ing the 1982-83 school year, when
the office was full time, over 723
students were served. Most of these

‘received personal advising. lt is at

best doubtful that one part-time
graduate assistant is able to serve
that many students.

ln addition to the lack of staff is
the problem of continuity. One
important aspect of having a full-
time professional in the office is that
it enables a continuous year—to-year,

day-to-day dialogue with the busi- V

nesses which offer the internships.

Without this dialogue, new intern-
ship possibilities will be hard to dis-
cover and current program may be
lost. A graduate assistant will most
likely work in the office for only one
year, thus destroying all continuity
of placement. When they leave they
take all their personal contacts with
them. Also, being in the office only
two and one-half days per week will
leave little if no time for recruitment
of new internship programs.

It is clear, unfortunately, that
many university officials are unable
to come to grips with the evidence
proving that the part-time status of
the internship office is insufficient.
The administrations response to the
problem and to the student concern
has been less than dismal.

unknown. They are unknown not
only to this writer but to the admin-
istration as well. In the Senate
Council meeting of December l2,
Vice-Chancellor Freeman argued
that the debate over the internship
office concerns an issue ofpriorities,
and that the university administra-
tion must first establish their own
list of overall priorities. Maybe Vice-
Chancellor Freeman, Provost Ben-
jamin, and colleagues should
mini-bus out to the Harley Hotel for
a weekend retreat of agenda and
priority setting. Maybe then they
could find an effective way of allo-
cating .0009 percent of the overall

university budget. It is important to “

realize that only an approximate
$25,000 above the current outlay for
the part-time office is needed to
make it full-time. The Student
Government Board is able to allo-
cate over a quarterof a million dol-
lars each year without many
problems; therefore, it is bewilder-
ing to me why these top university
officials are having such a hard time
with $25,000.

Two months have passed since
Dr. Freeman announced that priori-
ties must be set. lt appears that stal-
ling tactics are being used. How
convenient it will be for university
officials to wait until April (when
most students have gone home) to
make their decision.

To a great extent, the administra-
tion has ignored the students’ pleas.

undergraduates called for the rein-
statement of a full-time office. A
petition with their signatures was
presented to the Provost and the
University Senate. To this, the
administration gave little more than
a nod. They were, in essence, ignor-
ing the wishes of over 1,500 students.

It is puzzling to this writer why the
administration will not act. Could it
be that they are too proud to bow to
student outcries? I sincerely hope
not. But what other reasons could
they have? The evidence is conclu-
sive that a full-time internship office
is in the best interests of all con-
cerned. Only through continued
pressure by students and faculty will
the administration finally get the
message.

8GB member calls neighborhood unsafe,
requests additional campus bus, more runs

E By Diane Lefkowitz

The Pitt News

The Interfraternity Council and
Panhellenic Association recently
endorsed a Student ‘G ernment
Board proposal calling an extra
campus bus to facilitate residents of
the new fraternity housing complex,
but whether thebus is needed is still
be' debated.

proposal calls for an exten-
sion of the current cut-off time for

the bus, 10:30 n.m., to ll:50 p.m.
weekdays and 2:20 a.m. on we -

- ends. It also calls for two buses_

instead of one to run during the day.
This increase would mean a bus

‘would begin the route every 15 min-

utes rather than every 25 minutes, as

it does now. ‘

Accordi to John Vrana, vice
chancellor business and finance,
the buses that run later in the even-
ing always have extra seats.

“The information that we have is,
[during] the later part of those even-

ing hours, there's certainly space on
the bus for extra people,” he said. He

It’s not that great of a
neighborhood...It

really doesn ’t matter I

how much it cost,
because they're going
to haveto do it.’

——John Geyer

added the issue is not the frequency
of the bus but what the cut-off hour
should be.

Board member John G r, who
formulated the proposal \w' board
member ‘Pamela Hart, said the
hours should be extended for the
safety ofthe students going back and

 

I:

forth from the complex, which is
located on the northwest side of Pitt
stadium.

“It's not that great of a neighbor-

, hood," he said. ‘‘It really doesn’t

matter how much it’ll cost because
they’re 'ng to have to do it. It
should I considered a cost of the
housing project itself.”

The buses, contracted with
Schmitt Bus Compa , have a total
operatin cost of a t $8,500 an
average 001 month. accordin
Sergeant George Lancaster of
parking division of the campus
police.

“You're running into a cost fac-
tor,” he said. “Maybe you need a bus
at 12:10 for the students [leaving]

Hillman Libra , but the rest of the
time the bus [w d be]just standing
there.”

However, Geyer thinks the uni-
versity has a responsibility to insure
the safety of the 200 students living
at the complex, as well as visitors.
The complex is scheduled to open in
September.

“If you’re going to have students
there, u ha
y’re sa ,” he said.

Not only would the extra bus
serve those residents, according to
Geyer, but nursing, medical and
pharmacy students whose facilities
are located on the hill would also
benefit from the additional bus.

Vrana is investigating the matter
before a decision about the necessity
of the bus is made.

Pitt gets
budgetboost

continued from Daze one
Pitt rticipates. That figure is
dou last year’s funding of$l0
million.

Pitt’s Western Pennsylvania
Advanced 'Technology Center,
funded in part by the Ben Frank-
lin Partnershi , currently is con-
ducting 48 di ent projects with
various small businesses and
industry.

“We are just beginn' to
make some in-roads with ' us-
tries in the region,” Dr. Roger
Ahlbrandt, from the Office ofthe
Provost, said. “If the budget
didn't increase, that interest
would have withered.

“I think it is very, very impor-
tant to the stateto pass the $20
million appropriation,“ Ahl-
brandt said.

Without the increase in fund-
ing, Ahlbrandtsaid, the center
would have, “been faced with a
situation late in the spring where

we would have had little flexibil- ~

ity to take on new projects.”

This is the sixth budget pres-
ented by Thornburgh to the state
legislature since he became gov-~
ernor in 1979.

continued from page one
classes, but a final decision will not
be made until later this year.

Half of Oakland's commuter pop-
ulation uses mass transit, and they
will have to contend with rerouting
and new bus stops because PAT is
rerouting 20‘ buses in and out of
Oakland. Roling said that the cur-
rent traffic jams on Fifth Avenue are
small compared to what they will be
like this summer.

Roling said local traffic planners
will try to reduce Oakland traffic by
10 percent by advocating use of mass
transit and group commuting to
reduce the private cars coming into
the area. ‘

“We’re going to see Fifth Avenue
backed up past Carlow College a lot
worse than it is now,” Roling said.
“People are going to have to be very,
very careful because they’ll be fight-
ing with the buses.”

The closings, detours and bus
reroutings will isolate the Oakland
area for commuters travelling to the
south and west, Roling said.

“Oakland’s going to be a little
oasis."

A list of the closings and detours
includes: ~

0 The Boulevard will be closed at
Craft and Forbes Avenues inbound,
thus preventing any access to the
Parkway via the Boulevard from
Oakland.

0 Detour: PennDOT suggests you
follow Fifth Avenue to Seneca
Street (just past the Birmingham
Bridge) to the Boulevard. You can
get on the Liberty Bridge, Cros-
stown Boulevard or the Parkway
West from there.

0 The Boulevard‘s outbound
ramp to Oakland will be closed.

0 Detour»: Follow Seneca Street to
Forbes Avenue to Craft Avenue to
Fifth Avenue into Oakland. Craft
Avenue is now open to two-way
traffic.

If this sounds complicated, con-
sider the following:

_O For those crafty commuters who
will try to take alternate routes to or
from Oakland, PennDOT and the

city are planning 31 other construc-
tion projects which will coincide
with the reconstruction of the Park-
way East.

0 For instance, if you were think-
ing of taking the Polish H.i1l shortcut
to Oakland, think again. Bigelow
Boulevard will be converted to a
two-lane road from downtown to
Blessing Street in the Hill District
sometime in May due to construc-
tion of the Bloomfield Bridge.

0 In addition, Crosstown Boule-
vard will be restricted to allow for an
extension to the Northshore
Expressway, tying up traffic coming
from the North Hills.

0 For those thinking of traveling
eastbound on Baum Boulevard, the

city is planning to tear down the,

Baum Boulevard Bridge at More-
wood Avenue and replace it.

.0 Finally, commuters from the
West and South will run into traffic
snarls because of PennDOT's resur-
facing of part of the Parkway West
near Greentree.

Lllnderrepresentation inve_s_l_:_ijgated '

Pitt lacks female leaders

By Megan McGough
The Pitt News

A new Provost's Advisory Com-
mittee said it is concerned about the
lack of women in leadership posi-
tions in faculty and administration
at Pitt.

“Take a look at the brass of the
university —'there just aren’t any
women there,” committee chairper-
son Marigold Edwards said.
Edwards is one of 20 women Pitt
Provost Roger Benjamin appointed
last March to the Advisory Commit-
tee on Women’s Concerns.
Concerns.

. Though women make up 54 per-
cent of the United States’ popula-
tion, less than l5 percent of Pitts
tenured faculty is female. Such sta-
tistics, according to special assistant
to the provost Cynthia Vanda, sym-

‘ bolizes what is going on in society.

In an effort to combat the appar-
ent underrepresentation of women
in leadership positions, the commit-
tee is investigating the tenure pro-
cess and other issues of interest to
women at Pitt. . ' _

Last term, the committee distrib-
uted "a questionnaire to tenured
female faculty members. In it, they
were asked to comment on the'pre_s-
ence of any sexual discrimination in
university departments. Other ques-

Ron itz/ The Pittiews
Dr.Marigold Edwards

tio_ns also inquired about the
amount of support they received
from their colleagues while seeking
tenure.

The committee hopes that the
extent of any sex discrimination will
show up in the responses. The first
annual report making all question-
naire results public will be released
this spring. It will submit a list of
recommendations at the end of the
year, but the committee does not
have the power to act on them.

A second questionnaire was also
sent out to all Pitt administrators to

test their awareness of university‘

policies concerning sexual
harassment.

“We want to be sure that people
fully understandthe procedures...we
need to find out whether harassment
is an issue at Pitt,” Edwards
explained. ‘

In addition to faculty members,
the committee addresses the con-

cerns of female staff members at i

Pitt. A subcommittee "called Out
Reach was formed to find what
problems, ifany, staff members have
with sexual discrimination.

“We’re trying to bring faculty and
staff together so they can recognize
that many of the same issues affect
them both,” Vanda said. The lack of
adequate child care and payment of
lower salaries to women in compari-
son to those of men are two issues
with which both faculty and staff
must contend, she said. A

“We don’t know exactly what we
will be recommending [in the
report]. We have to wait until all of
the questionnaires are back and we
have full reports from the Out Reach
Committee,” Vanda said.

Edwards said the committee does
not expect instant results. “Right
now we are looking for problem
areas." Once uncovered, “these

issues could be our focus for the next

several years,” she said.

Founder of Nationality
Rooms Program dies at 93

Ruth Crawford Mitchell, founder and director emerita ofthe Uni-
versity of Pittburgh‘s Nationality Rooms Program, died in Presbyter-
ian University Hospital yesterday after an extended illness. She was
93. ‘

Mitchell was born in Atlantic Highlands, and grew up in St. Louis,
Missouri. After graduating from Vassar College in 1912, she received
a master’s degree in social work from Washington University in St.
Louis in l9l5. .

Mitchell came to Pittsburgh in 1922 and two years later began to
lecture on the historyyof immigration in Pittsburgh’s department of
economics. In 1926, Pi_tt chancellor John G. Bowman asked her to
help him work on the interior of the Cathedral of Learning. It was
from this that the Nationality classrooms eventually emerged.

She organized committees which raised the funds and worked with
the architects at the university and abroad until 16 Nationality Class-
rooms were completed by I943. The rooms are decorated in authentic
period styles of some 16 nationality groups that helped to settle the
Pittsburgh region and gifts of those ethnic communities to the univer-
sity. 4

Since her retirement in 1956, Mitchell served as director emerita of
the Nationality Rooms Program and as consultant to the Nationality
Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs at the University of
Pittsburgh. Between 1969 and 1978, she conceived and planned the

.tercentenary celebration in honor of Elena Cornaro, the first woman
in history to receive a Ph.D. degree — in 1678 at the University of

Padua, Italy.

Her many honors include the Order of the White Lion from the
Republic of Czechoslovakia and the David Glick award for distin-
guished services in the field of international affairs from the World
Affairs Council of Pittsburgh. In I955, she was selected Distinguished
Daughter of Pennsylvania. Inil972, she ‘received the Chancellor’s
Medal from Pittchancellor ,Wesley W. Posvar for “a long and distin-
guished contribution to the University of Pittsburgh."

. “We are all saddened by the passing of this great woman," said

.. Posvar. “Her contributions to the university areinestimable. The

Nationality Rooms in particular are a reminder of the wit, wisdom
and vision of this woman. I personally mourn the loss of a friend. But

there is much comfort to be taken in her legacy. She will be remem- «

bered throughout all the history of this institution.”

A university memorial service will take place in Heinz Memorial
Chapel on the University of Pittsburgh campus, noon, Tuesday, Feb.
14..

Wednesday, February_8, 1984

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

It was a game the Panther bas-
ketball team meant to lose.
Down by five with seven minutes
to go on the road, it was -not
likely for a Pitt comeback.

The sight of a 2-8 conference
record was staring at Roy Chip-
man. Added to that was the
adversity, as.disenchanted for-
ward Jeff Robinson was sus-
pended from the team
indefinitely for comments made
in Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press.
The setting was not one of mak-
ing a rally in Storrs, Conn.

Yet, this was not the same

Panthers’ chang

squad which collapsed against
Georgetown, Providence and
Boston College in the final min-
utes. There were several changes
evident in Monday's 75-7] win
over Connecticut.

One was the emergence of
guard Billy Culbertson as a
leader. Even though the statistics
did not show an outstanding per-
formance —— four points in 43
minutes -— the senior showed the
leadership quality which has
been missing from the team. At
one point, for example, he
screamed at Andre Williams and
Chip Watkins to rebound after
the two watched Connecticut
players crashing the boards.

His clutch play during the lat-
ter part of the game — two steals,
including one which lead to the

ports

page I 1

opening overtime basket —— was
the impetus Pitt was missing dur-
ing the last four games.
Another positive note was the
performance of Andre Williams
at the big forward position. The
6-8 junior forward, who has been
plagued with injuries and incon-
sistent play since the Panthers
entered the Big East, had one of
his best games Monday night. He
hit seven for eight from the floor
for 14 points, equally getting the
inside basket as well as making
the 18-foot jumper from the
corner. Getting such play from
Williams theirest of the season
will ease the burden off Clyde
Vaughan.
Vaughan, who scored 29
points and grabbed 12 rebounds
Monday, is returning to the form ‘

es result in 75-71 win

which made him the Big East’s
leading scorer last season.
Instead of staying on the wing
and shooting outside, Vaughan
exploited inside, hitting the
jumper inside the paint and fight-
ing for the offensive rebound.

A key to the improvement of
the inside game is the offensive
development of center Keith
Armstrong. Armstrong, better
known for his shot-blocking and
defensive abilities, is also show-
ing signs of that he can play at the
other end of the court. Even
though the 6-9 sophomore
scored only four points, the two
baskets came on power moves
usually reserved for Vaughan. A
third basket was wiped out on an
offensive foul call. "x

A change in Chipman’s substi-

tution policy worked success-
fully Monday night as well.
Instead of using people just to
keep them happy, Chipman
stuck_ with a veteran starting _
lineup, and only Chip Watkins
and Curtis Aiken played more
than 10 minutes coming off the
bench.

Finally, the Panthers were
able to remain intense for the
entire game. Unlike the past,
where Pitt would lose concentra-
tion for various lengths of time,
the team put together 45 minutes
of consistent basketball.

. However, it may be too late for
Pitt to put together a rush to
leave the bottom half of the Big
East or to make them attractive
to the National Invitation Tour-
nament.

Thump, thump. The sound was
lovely to Roy Chipman. Thump.
thump, thump. This was last
summer, one of those oppressive
Pittsburgh days when the humidity

clamps you in a bear hug. Chipman ’

was straggling toward his office at
Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House to do
whatever basketball coaches do in
the off-season. Thump, thump. He
poked his head inside. Thump. He
laughed.

“He does things that are very
monotonous," Chipman said, the
subject being Clyde Vaughan. “We
told him he had to work on putting
the ball on the floor, and for literally
two hours a day over the spring and
summer all he did was dribble the
ball through cones._ lt’s stuff that an
8-year-old, after 45 minutes, would
be tired of. Clyde would do it for
hours. You'd come by in the
summer, and he’d be the only one in
the gym."

Vaughan, born in England to
Jamaican parents, is a blue-collar
basketball fanatic at the University
of Pittsburgh, a 6-4 construction
worker in a game of ballet dancers.
There are few through-the-legs or
in-your-face moves or wham-bam-
thank-you jams in his arsenal. What
he does is toss in l7-footers until the
Field House nets grow blisters. “He
does the one thing you have to do,
and that‘s score,“ Syracuse Coach
Jim Boeheim was saying at midsea-
son. “They say he doesn’t do a lot of

turns to Pitt basketball, the words
most often heard are Clyde
Vaughan, Clyde Vaughan and Clyde
Vaughan. . »

Although Clyde Vaughan does
represent the biggest part of the
whole, Pitt does have another note-

worthy roundballer on its scholar-..

ship rolls.

This player leads the Big East in
scoring with 24.4 points per game -
l3_th best in the country — and ranks
third in the conference in rebounds.
The player was named an
honorable-mention All-America
last season and was deemed a pre-
season All-America and preseason
Big East Player of the Year this year.

Last season, this player was
picked as Big East Player of the
Week three times, more than any
other player. The player captured
the honor again last Monday.

“People there were telling Rodney
that here’s a guy who gets no respect
even in Pittsburgh,” says Kimball
Smith, Pitt’s basketball publicist.
“He told Clyde you have to work
hard to get respect.”

Chipman giggles. “What no one
could imagine was how hard Clyde
would work. The kid is relentless,”
he said.

Vaughan is the world’s best bas-
ketball player from England by way
of New Rochelle, N.Y. But no one—-
not Chipman, not Smith, not Pitt
Athletic Director Ed Bozik——was
aware of Vaughan’s heritage, nor his
British citizenship, nor his given
name of Clive. It was not until
Vaughan sought a position on the
U.S. Pan-American Games team
that his secret was revealed for pub-
lic consumption, that the black-kid
from New Rochelle was-identified as
a foreigner. “I wanted to prove to the
best players in the country that I was
just as good as they were,” he said
dejectedly. But Vaughan agreed to
represent his native England in the
World University Games, and he
shoveled in 37 points a game to lead
the tournament in scoring.

“I didn't say anything because I
didn’t want people to think I was

“It's whether or not he can play

Collins shoots for Lions

"rt continued from page twelve

inside moves of Jennifer Bruce (24.4
ppg, 9.7 RBs).

It is the threat from the outside
shooter that loosens a collapsed
defense, however. Stephanie Col-
lins’ left —— handed jumpshots from
15 to 20 feet powered Pitt past Prov-
idence Saturday night, enabling the
Lady Panthers to gain first place.

“We're taking advantage of what

,we see we can do,"Saurer said.
“We’re getiing good bench play.
Collins came off the bench and

played a great game (against

Providence)."

Collins was a perfect shot Satur-
day night: 6 — 6 from the field and 5
-—‘ 5 on the free throw line. The 5 --8
junior said she uses a’ one —— handed
shot that she learned in high school,
and has never played any other
position.

“(The Pitt coaches) have really
helped me build confidence, and
with being consistent,”Collins said.
“I’m really not as quick as I'd like to
be so I rely on playing a steady game

-— try to be smart on defense.

“I try to anticipate where the ball
is going, but sometimesl make the
wrong choice. Sometimes I get
caught helping people a little too
much; I start cheating."

The long —— range shooter has not
cheated herself or her teammates of
her scoring ability, and the invest-
ments she has made have turned a
profit for Pitt.

\ “She has worked very hard,"
Saurer said. “She's not just shoot-
ing, but has developed agility and
finesse in moving to get the shot off.”

The coach attributes Collins’ suc-
cess to perseverence and a confi-
dence built through encouragement

and playing time. Collins is a good,

example of not giving up,"Saurer
said. “She really has a lot of confi-
dence now."

Saurer is less concerned about
Penn State‘s ability to affect her
team's scoring but emphasized the
Lady Lions‘ running game. “They
don’t appear to like to set up on
offense, but tend to score quickly —

 

ajump shot or a lay - up,"she said.

“We'll have to release sonic people
immediately (on defense). We’ll also
need to control the boards and to
stop the running game.”

A running game requires liberal

use of substitutes, which Penn State

uses, according to Saurer. “They
have two different teams, substitut-

ing five at a time. We keep our big

people in."

Collins echoes Saurer's assess-
ment of Penn State. “They are very
guard — oriented, preferring to play
a transition - type game. They like to
fast —— break and get the ball up the
court and score quickly."

doesn’t give me any ofthe headaches
usually associated with coaching.
She is always able to keep her cool
and we can always count on her in
the clutch.

“She’s also a real hard worker and
really creates excitement. Some of
the things she does on the court truly
amaze me.”

The slender 6—foot junior amazes

-“gather coaches as well.

“Jennifer is a very versatile
player,” said Penn State head coach
Rene Portland. “She plays inside
and outside equally well. Her size
and agility definitely work to Pitt’s
advantage. She has a great nose for
the ball and moves to the basket
well. She’s a terrific girl as‘ well."

Bruce honed her talents,‘ best
exemplified by her quickness and
tough inside play, on the asphalt
courts near her home in the Knox-
ville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

\ “There’s a YMCA right in back of
my house, and they have an outdoor
court, and that’s where me and my
brother really grew up,” she said.

Her brother is Kirk Bruce, a guard
on the I974 Pitt men’s basketball
team who reached the NCAA East-
ern Regional finals. He is now'a high
school basketball coach at Clairton
High School near Pittsburgh, and he
can still recall the backyard confron-

.‘_tations of years gone by.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 8, 1984

“There was the court right across
the alley. You know, it was an inner-
city court, and there must have been
l,000 people playing," Kirk Bruce
said. “She was the only girl.

“She basically stayed outside, out
front, and would come inside when
she had the opportunity, like on fast

breaks.”

“That’s how I really started play-
ing,” his sister interjected. “Over
where I live, there’s not really that
many girls playing basketball.
There’s a few here and there, but on
the courts I play on, there’s mostly
all guys."

It was after years of honing her
talents to the clanging of the metal
backboard that Jennifer Bruce deve-
loped into a complete basketball
player.

“It got to the point where the only
way to stop her was to foul her,” her
older brother remembers. “The guys
knew they had to do something,
because they didn’t want Jenny to
embarrass them.”

Despite her slight build, Jennifer
Bruce can find a way to dominate a
basketball contest. She can rely on
her long-range jumpshot, drive
through the lane with a graceful lay-
up or post upinside and capitalize
on a teammate’s pass.

Kirk Bruce and the other neigh-
borhood players shared a great role
in polishing Jennifer’s brilliance.

-Recognition misses Bruce

“I think that‘s what made me
more of a physical player,” she said,
“since I’ve been playing with the
guys ever since I was in high school
and I play with them like every
summer.”

Jennifer Bruce graduated ._from
Carrick High School, where she led
the team to a Pittsburgh City League
championship as a junior in 1980.
She chose Tennessee Tech, not Pitt,
as her collegiate choice, but fate
intervened.

In an Ozanam summer league
game, Bruce twisted her left knee
afterwa rebound. It was drained in
Pittsburgh and an orthopedic sur-

geon gave her the OK to play, but A

she reinjured it in her first practicein
COOl(VlllC, Tenn. .

Bruce underwent ~ total recon-
struction surgery on her knee. She
travelled with the team for a season,
then moved on to Pitt and eventu-
ally the Big East Conference, where
men are men and women are

- unnoticed. —

“We really don’t get a lot offans. I
mean, say we’re playing in front‘ of
the guys. The fans might come in
early to their game, that’s all,” Bruce
said.

“We still haven’t got the exposure
and the media coverage, stuff like
that.'We have had a couple of our

Fitzgerald Field House can seat

For one game, against Northeast-

“It hurts a little bit because I’ll

‘What’s so hard about putting our

ATTENTION ALL GRADUATE STUDENTS!!!

PROPOSED STUDENT ACTIVITY FEE INCREASE

A student activity fee of $2 per term (3151 part-time) was established I
for all graduate students in 1973. This fee is used primarily to support
academic and social activities within your own school. It is also used
to provide graduate student discounts to activities sponsored by the

A Pitt Program Council (PPC) and to fund the university-wide activi-
ties of the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA).
Because ten years of inflation and added activities on all levels have
‘severely limited school budgets, a proposal to increase the activity fee
to $5 per term ($2 part-time) is being considered. Your respective
graduate schools will be voting on this proposal shortly. GPSA  
strongly encourages you to express an informed opinion on this issue

ierge G_o_ikovich/Pitt's Sports Inf_orn_1at_i_on‘

Coaches Andy Urbanic (middle) and Foge Fazio advise quarterback Chris Jelic.

Urbanic excited about season

Andy Urbanic is as upbeat as can
be about the future of the football
program at the University of Pitts-

burgh. His eyeglasses are definitely

rose-tinted these days.
Urbanic has been an assistant
coach at Pitt the past threerseasons,

, one under Jackie Sherrill and the

last two under Foge Fazio. He
believes the best is yet to come.
“We’ve got a real good team
returning, and with a good recruit-
ing year, we could have an outstand-
ing team,“ said Urbanic. He should
know an outstanding team when he
sees one, having been associated
with the Pitt program this long.
Before that, he coached eight

WPIAL championship teams while
earning Coach of the Year honors
five times during his ll years at Penn
Hills. 0

Both Brown University and Mar-
shall University spoke to Urbanic
about the head coachingjob at their
respective institutions this winter,
but Urbanic is staying at Pitt.

“I’m happy here,” he said, “and
I’m real comfortable coaching with
Foge. We’re on the same wave-
length. We’re pleased with the prog-
ress we‘re making.”

Fazio feels the same way about
Urbanic. “He represents our pro-
gram so well in so many ways," he
said. “He’s an excellent coach, a real

   
 

tactician and perfectionist. He gets
after the guys pretty good, and he
gets them going.

“He's one of our finest recruiters.
He makes a great personal appear-‘
ance and speaks well at public func-
tions and when the media come
calling."

Fazio also praised Urbanic’s

efforts over the past two years in ‘

helping Byran Thomas and then Joe
McCall.rush near 1,000 yards in
their respective senior seasons.

“There’s not a more dedicated guy

there than Andy Urbanic," said

Fazio, “and it rubs
everybody.”

Urbanic prepares backs for campaign

continued from page seventeen

McCall has completed his eligibil-
ity atwPitt and is pointing toward a
pro career. Urbanic doesn’t expect
the Panthers‘ running attack to skip
a beat, however, as some terrific
young talent returns.

At tailback, Darnell Stone,
Chuckie Scales and Billy Owens are
coming back, and at fullback, there
are Marc Bailey, Marlon Mclntyre
and Tom Brown.

“We’re looking to get some top-
rated players at those positions this
time out, too,“ said Urbanic, “and
we're out to get an outstanding
freshman quarterback to complete
the cast.

The Panthers are strong at that
position, too, with juniors John
Congemi, Chris Jelic and John
Cummings.

Ever since Tony Dorsett keyed a
comeback in Pitt's football fortunes
for Coach Johnny Majors, leading
the Panthers to a national cham-
pionship in I976, an outstanding
tailback has been paramount in
Pitt’s search for talent.

Stone started three games in place

Experience

of the injured McCall before he was
sidelined himself with a broken wrist
at ‘West Virginia. He was unable to
play the rest of the season but
accompanied the club to the Fiesta
Bowl and practiced for two weeks.

Stone, a 6-1, 205-lb. back, played
on championship teams for Bap
Manzini at Thomas Jefferson High
School. As a sophomore, he gained
132 yards on 37 carries for a 3.6
rushing average.

Scales, a 5-11, I82-lb. freshman
from West Mifﬂin who won Parade
All-America honors at Shady Side
Academy, scored a 21-yard touch-
down the first time he took a hand-
off for Pitt, at West Virginia. He
gained 210 yards on 32 carries for a
4.0 average. He also caught nine
passes for 58 yards and a game-
winning 20-yard touchdown catch
against Florida State.

Owens, a 6-2, I82-lb. freshman
from Syracuse, started the ‘season as
a defensive back but was switched to
the offensive unit when Stone was
injured. He responded brilliantly,
gaining I 16 yards on I4 carries —- an
8.3 yards-per-carry clip -— and

looked good against Louisville,
Army and Penn State.

“We don't know yet what we‘ve
got there,“ said Urbanic. “Spring
camp will tell us. He has a chance to
become a real good one. He has to
get bigger and stronger. He played a
lot of sports in high» school and
didn't get into weight training.
That’s essential now."

Weight training is a factor to
which Urbanic points in order to
explain the improved performances
by fullbacks Bailey and Mclntyre,
who were both plagued by injuries in
the past. They split time as juniors
and may do the same as seniors,
though they figure to be pressed by
Brown. '

“All running back positions will
be wide open,” said Urbanic. “Those
jobs are anybody’s right now."

Bailey and Mclntyre finished
second and third behind McCall in
rushing. Bailey, 5-11, 207 lbs., of
King of Prussia, carried the ball 86
times for 451 yards — a 5.2 average
— and three touchdowns, including

two 40-yard plus runs at Navy.
Mclntyre rushed 82 times for 414
yards.

“Marc and I get along great," said
Mclntyre. “I think we both were
stronger because we didn’t have to
take all the hitting and beating back
there. It made us a better rushing
team.”

Urbanic believes that. “The full-
back has to do a lot of busy work
here, blocking and brings in plays, as
well as rushing for the tough yards.
With Tom Brown, a sophomore
from Lower Burrell, back there too,
we should be as strong there as any-
body in the country.”

‘‘I‘m really excited,” he said. “I

Fight cancer
with your
bare hands.

The best way to guard
_ against breast cancer is
right in your hands. It's
called breast self-exam-
ination. Ask your doctor to
teach you how to do it.
And while you're at it, ask
him about mammography
—a low dose breast x-ray.

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

Tomorrow evening, another Bi
East power invades Fitzgerald Fielg
House. However, this team has
some major differences from the
giants that have visited the hill as of
late. For starters, it is not a basket-
ball team that will be competing
tomorrow and last, but not least, the
squad is not a visitor to the univer-
sity, but one of its own.

The Panther track team entertain
five regional teams at the Pitt Open
Invitational. Among those traveling
to the Field House oval will be Clar-
ion University, Slippery Rock Uni-
versity, Robert Morris College,
Carnegie-Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburgh-

. Johnstown.
The Panthers, runner-up in the ‘

Big East last season, will run the
meet on Thurday without some of
their key people. Hurdler Roger
Kingdom will not be competing as
he is scheduled to run at the Olympic
lnvitational in East Rutherford,
New Jersey. Kingdom will face some
of the toughest competition in the
world for the third weekend in a row
as he represents Pitt in the 60-meter
hurdles.

 
 
  

Also missing from Coach John
Vasvary’s squad will be NCAA qual-
ifier Todd Colas and the distance
medley relay comprised of Alan
Laws, Tim Manes, Bill Moorhead
and Garland Brown, as they head
for the Budweiser Lite Invitational
in Boston on Saturday.

Even with these members missing,
Vasvary boasts an impressive young
squad eager to see competition.

“This meet will give us a chance to
try some things,” said Vasvary. “It
will also give us a chance to compete
without having to pack up and travel
somewhere.”

Competing for the Panther track
team tomorrow evening will be some
names familiar to those who follow
other Pitt athletics. Mark Mazziotti,
who will be pole vaulting for Pitt, is
also a member of the soccer teapi.
Also seeing action tomorrow night
for the Panthers will be Randy
Dixon and Andrew Lewis in the
shot, Matt Daniels in the highjump
and 55-yard hurdles, Brian Davis in
the 55-yard dash and Joe McCall in
