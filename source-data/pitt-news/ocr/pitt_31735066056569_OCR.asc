Casey doing
well despite
an infection

By Nicole Stiller
For The Pitt News

Doctors said that Gov. Robert Casey is
doing well after receiving intravenous
antibiotics for a fever and chills he experi-
enced on Saturday night.

The fever has subsided, but doctors
continue to monitor his condition closely
for further signs of infection.

According to Dr. William Follansbee,
Casey is responding well to the various
medications being administered to cure
any bacterial infection. ‘

Doctors said they believe the cause of
the fever was due to the onset of a blood
infection from bacteria in his bowel.

Lab results from the heart biopsy are
reported as being 100 percent normal,
and there have been no signs of rejection
to the transplant thus far.

The results of the measurement of heart
functioning were also normal.

According to Jane Duffield, spokesper-
son for the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, Casey is feeling much
better and was reported to be walking the
hospital corridors on Sunday.

Casey was scheduled to be released on
Tuesday but will be kept five to seven

days longer for further observation and to

continue antibiotic treatment.

Casey became ill on Sept. 25 and was
admitted to Presbyterian University
Hospital on Sept. 28 where it was discov-
ered that he was suffering from a
cytomegalovirus infection.

According to Follansbee, the latest tests
indicate that Casey is still suffering from
the CMV infection, and it could be awhile
before he has a full recoveiy.

The Candida infection discovered while
he was in the hospital was treated and
cleared up last week.

Councilmember Cohen briefs
University Democrats on safety

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Safety on campus and in the city of
Pittsburgh became one of the main top-
ics at the University Democrats meeting
last night,

University Democrats’ speaker and
City Councilmember Dan Cohen said
there should be more beat cops from
Zone Five in Oakland, especially in
North Oakland.’ ‘ ‘

Cohen said he would also like to see a
police hministation somewhere in North
Oakland, perhaps on Craig Street. S

“It doesn’t have to be [as large as] the.

old zone four station in South Oakland,”
Cohen said. “It could just be a store-
front.”

When one student compared the
Original Hot Dog Shop to a ministation,
Cohen said there needs to be more coop-
eration between city and university

police.

“What happens is you have a lot of
overlap in some areas [like the “O”l, and
then there are areas not covered by
police,” he said. Cohen also said that the
numerous police officers near the “O”
have little to no experience in crowd
control, making them less effective.

‘_‘There needs to be better policing, as
well as more police [in general],” he said.

Cohen discussed the anti-drug loitering

bill that Mayor Sophie Masloff vetoed '

this summer. “Basically the bill said if
you engage in conduct incidental to drug
trafficking, you can be arrested,” he said.
Some actions that would constitute
arrest include passing money or a plastic
bag, according to Cohen. “The city needs
to give police the leeway to arrest people
in drug trafficking,” he said.
Cohen said he thinks that candidate
Tom Murphy will pass the anti—drug loi-

natural mountain setting.

“You can’t camp in the city
just like you can’t build tele-
scopes on sacred land,”
Staryszack, a member of the
Student Environmental Action
Coalition, said

Despite the sounds of the city
drowning out the protest of the
drums, flute and acoustic guitar
being played at the Fifth
Avenue camp site, the SEAC
week-long vigil continued yes-
terday. The vigil is in protest of

vPitt’s possible $15 million

investment in the Mount
Graham telescope -project.
According to member Jeremy
Mullinary, SEAC does’n’t aim to
block the project but to relocate

the site to a place with less neg.-

ative effects than the Mt.-
Graham site.—

She said the current tele-

 

scope proposal invades the
sacred land of the San Carlos
Apache Nation and threatens
the lives of various endangered
species.

“We’re not against the tele-
scope,” Mullinary said. “But
there have been 38 different
places which have also been
recommended by major
astronomers.”

Erected among the pitched
tents was a shelter where SEAC
members handed out Mt.

Graham fact sheets and offered

a‘ petition to students passing
by.

“Camping here seemed like
the best way to get the message
out,” SEAC member Melissa
Davis said. “It works better than
posters  we get to meet and

‘_ educate a lot of people.”

Pitt sophomore Heather

9 Arendt was one student who

/

said she was enlightened by the
Vigil. -

“I’m astounded that Pitt
would [consider having] such
disrespect for the Apache cul-
ture,” Arendt said as she signed
the petition Tuesday night, join-
ing over 800 Pitt students and
staff members who have already
signed the petition.

“I wish there was more com-
munication between students
and the administration,_” -Pitt stu-
dent Mike Hedrck said. It seems
they shouldn’t be doing some-
thing which so many students
object to.”

According to SEAC member
Josh Knauer, Mt. Graham
protests won’t stop when the
vigil concludes on Friday. SEAC
plans to set up a meeting to
speak directly with Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor and present
their concerns along with the

petition. .

“We have a chancellor who
believes in cultural diversity,”
Knauer said. “We’ve got every
organization on campus that
stands for diversity behind us.
So there will be a major conflict
of his interests if he decides to
go with [the Mt. Graham pro-
jectl.”

Even if ‘their protests have a
limited success at Pitt, Knauer
said, the SEAC’s pressure has
had effects on other campuses.

“Michigan State had just
announced they might be inter-
ested,” Knauer said. “[Butl they
said they don’t want to have the
same problems as the University
of Pittsburgh  and Chancellor
O’Connor.”

According to Pitt spokes-
person Mary Ann Aug, the uni-
versity is still studying the pro-
ject. ’

“I don’t think our university
should be supplying the space
and the money for a black cul-
tural center,” Bill Gollatz said.
According to Gollatz, the inter-
ests of the black community are
not the sole responsibility of the
University of Pittsburgh.

Some College Republicans
said the BAS would find a larger
backing if the organization sup-
ported a multicultural center.

“I can’t really support a black
cultural center,” Jim Pacelli said.

. Such a center would “exclude

other cultural groups.”
“I support a multicultural cen-
ter,” Pacelli said. -.
Pitt students should strive to
“become more of a unified
body,” said Chad Devinney,

public relations director for the.
s College Republicans.

Since the cost of tuition has
risen faster than inﬂation, Lurie
suggested the money, which
might be spent on a black cul-
tuial center, could go to schol-
arshipsl instead, which would
help students who cannot
afford college tuition.

The wording of the ballots

suggested the CR’s opposition
to the black cultural center,
emphasizing the use of tuition
money to fund the center.

One choice on the ballot was
phrased, “I strongly oppose the
funding of a black cultural cen-
ter with my tuition money here
on the Pitt campus.” '

The other choice was word-
ed, “I support my tuition money
going toward the funding of a
black cultural center here on the
-Pitt campus.”

The guest speaker at the
College Republicans meeting

was Greg Cooper, field director
of the Tom Ridge for Governor
campaign . in Western
Pennsylvania. ‘ ' 8

Cooper explained why he felt
Pennsylvania needs a strong
conservative governor.

Among the statistics. Cooper
mentioned is Allegheny
County’s distinction as the old-
est county in the nation, ‘sur-
passing Florida’s Dade County
during the ‘80s.

‘In addition, Pennsylvania lost
a quarter of a million people
who were in their 20s in that
decade.

Pennsylvania ranks 45th in.

the U.S. in new job creation and
47th in new manufacturing job
creation, despite being the fifth-
largest state. ,

Without a Republican gover-
nor, “were not going to be eco-

nomically competitive,” Cooper

said.

Cooper also criticized the
bureaucracy of Pennsylvania’s
government, especially the
Department of Environmental
Resources.

“We’ve got our sights set
squarely on DER,” Cooper said.
“It’s a monster out of control.”

For instance, Hersheyfoods
Corporation, a company very
loyal to Pennsylvania, built a
pasta plant in Virginia because
the company got construction
approval in seven days from
Virginia.

The same formalisms would
have taken Pennsylvania’s DE__R
18 months.“Who’s losing out?
We are!” Cooper said, referring
to his college-age audience.

“We’ve got to make
Pennsylvania a more job—friend—
ly place,” he said, “or there will
be no jobs.”

“Under Tom Ridge, DER is
not going to exist,’i he
said. “Like [Richard] Thornburgh
took care of PennDOT,” Ridge

would streamline DER, Cooper"

said.

“We need young, bright, tal-
ented people to be involved in
the problems in the city,” he
said. “Crime is the biggest prob-
lem facing the city now.”

Cohen said students need to
become more involved in their
community while in college.

One way students can
become involved, according to
Cohen, is by learning the name
of their state legislator in
Harrisburg and where he or she
stands on certain issues.

According to Cohen, students

concerned with crime and safe-'

ty should attend Zone Five pub-
lic meetings.

“Go and discuss where more
police need to be deployed and
times when there needs to be
more of a police presence,” he
said.

Clohen also suggested neigh-
borhood block watches as a
way to cut crime. “You don’t
have to be elected in politics to
affect change. You can change
things by just getting involved.”

“If I’m not re—elected, I’ll still
be involved in. my community,”
Cohen said.

Overdue recognition

The mainstream for many years has overlooked and
even belittled the contributions made to popular cul-
ture. by those of African descent. The artistic creativity
of African females especiallyihas seldom been recog-
nized for its true merit. ' O ’

These forgotten artists were finally given their rightful
place last week with the awarding of the Nobel Prize

for Literature to Toni Morrison. It was a milestone in the .
history of Nobel, for Morrison was the first female of ‘

African descent to be awarded the .prize..~

Ms. Morrison and her novels are a testament to the
rich African culturewhich has played a signiﬁcant role
in the shaping of mainstream culture in America. As the
Nobel academy put it, Morrison “gives life to an essen-
tial aspect of American reality [in novelsl characterized
by visionary force and poetic import.” '

Her achievements, not only in the writing field, but

’ also as a professor at Princeton University, can only be

a source of pride for other women and other African

Americans. . I
Morrison’s award not only highlights her achieve-

ments and contributions,_ but it also recognizes that all

I African females who came before her left their mark on

society.
A mark which, for too long, people have tried to pre-
tend didn’t exist. ’

Home care maintenance
Many things stand in the way of achieving the best

» possible education the university can provide. The lack

of a sense of security felt by studentsat the University
of Pittsburgh, in light of the recent escalation in crime,
is a prime example. ‘ .

The students can continue to voice their concerns to

E administrators and their student representatives, but

they also must realize that the University of Pittsburgh is

' not the only policy maker who can effect positive

change in the Oakland area. Another is the city govern-

‘ ment in Pittsburgh. ‘

City Councilmember Dan Cohen, addressing the

- University Democrats last night in the William Pitt

Union, stressed the importance of the need for young

«people to get involved in the community at large. Dan
A Cohen believes that government can be a catalyst for

positive change, and that goes for Oakland and the Pitt

, campus.

"‘We needyour brains, your talent and your new
blood,” Cohen told those attending.

Cohen said there are many challenges facing the city
of Pittsburgh, stressingfthe rise in violent crime and
some steps which need to be taken to help curb it.

Even though many students may come from cities and
towns all around the country, Pittsburgh becomes your
home away from home for at least four years. Take an
interest in makingit a better place and become active in
the greater community. ‘

Dems deprive blacks of American dream

— Hayes Davis, vice president of e

the University Democrats,
recently blasted College
Republican public relations offi-
cer» Chad Devinney and his
party for being exclusionary
when it comes to minorities
(Tlye Pitt News, Oct. 6). Mr.
Davis raised several issues
which are of true concern to the
black community, but rather
failed to research the issues
thoroughly or failed to report
them honestly.

Mr. Davis accused the GOP of

running “blatantly racist ads”

during the 1988 presidential
Campaign —— referring to the
Willy Horton ads. What Mr.
Davis neglected to realize in his
“careful research” of the topic is
that the ads were originally ran
by New York Governor Mario
Cuorno, a Democrat, during the
primaries.

The ads were picked up by
supporters of Bush and not the
Bush campaign managers them-
selves. Bush then sued to have
the commercials repealed
immediately. at V

Mr. Davis also referred to a
Bush veto of an inner—city aid
package. This is true, but I fail
to see how he can conclude
from this that the party is exclu-
sionary. Millions of the tax pay-
ers’ dollars are poured into
“inner-city aid packages” each
yean

Despite this, the problems
which plague the inner cities of
America get increasingly worse.
What most liberals fail to under-
stand is that government can
not solve the problems of the
people regardless of party affili-
ation. It is the necessary respon-
sibility of the people to better
themselves.

In conclusion Davis praised
the Clinton administration for

appointing “the most racially

ldiverse cabinet in history”.

Once again, Mr. Davis’ “facts”
seem to be contradictory to the
truth. While Clinton
appointed his fair share of —
and yes, I will say the word —
tokens, his cabinet remains pre-
dominantly white, male, mil-
lionaires over 50 years ofage.
His cabinet, in fact, contains
more millionaires than any
other presidential cabinet in his-
tory.

has’

Booker T.
Stallworth

Mr. Davis, the Republican
party is not exclusionary. Maybe
it’s time you learned your histo-
ry.
The Republican party was
founded as an abolitionist orga-
nization -dedicated to having a
society of equals. By equality,
they did not mean equality of
outcome, but rather, equality of
opportunity. Itiwas Abraham
Lincoln, the first Republican
president, who emancipated the
slaves, and the Democrats,
which fought a war to prevent
it. It was the northern
Republicans who fought to end
the Jim Crow laws of the south-
ern Democrats. It was conserva-
tive Christians such as Dr.
Martin Luther King, jr., who first
asked that we be judged on the
content of our character rather
than on the color of our skin. Is
the Republican party inclusive
of minorities? It was the
Republican party which was up
to 45 percent black from the
period of reconstruction until
the New Deal.

Mr. Davis fails to realize that it
is the Democratic party which is
truly exclusive when it comes to
minorities. It wishes to sepa-

rates or divide the black com-

munity from the remainder of
society.

It perpetuates the stereotype
that all minorities are incapable
of achieving greatness in
American society.

It perpetuates the stereotype
that blacks are inferio_r and

require government aid and '

intervention in order to survive
and succeed. It perpetuates the
stereotype that blacks, along

’ with women, are victims. The

Democrats, Mr. Davis, wish to
exclude black America from the
American dream.

This is, the time for black
Americans to turn their back on
the New Deal Democrats who
have given nothing to the black
community but a raw deal.

For it was the New Deal pro-
grams which spawned the
poverty, violence and basic
demoralization among inner-
city blacks. ’

Don’t accept the pacifier the
liberals are trying to shove
down the -throats of black
America. It is time to make a
choice either-wait for gov-
ernment to do away with pover-
ty, racism and crime, or like so

many groups before, begin to *

take destiny into your own
hands. 3

I wrote this not as a member
of the College Republicans, but
as a black American who
strongly disagrees with Mr.
Davis’ comments.

Mr. Davis. I think you need to

Intensity personiﬁed

Jennie Driscoll brings unique passion to Pitt volleyball

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Pittsburgh has had its share of intense
athletes. the kind that will run over anyone

' in their way —— Jack Lambert, Gregg Lloyd,

Rick Tocchet and Jennie Driscoll.

Jennie Driscoll? _

The redshirt freshman middle hitter who
has brought a unique intensity to the Pitt
volleyball team.

“Jennie is an animalistic competitor,” Pitt I

head coach Cindy Braziel said. “Get out of
her way. You had better play hard or get
off the court. That is a priceless attitude. If
every single kid out there had that, we’d
be a whole different team.” I

Braziel and assistant coach Brian Begor
have pushed their players for intensity all
season. '

“That is the whole key for thisteam,”
Begor said. “When we’re making assertive
moves on the court, taking the play at our
opponent, we are a pretty good team.”

Driscoll’s attitude makes her stand out
from the rest of the team, so much so that
even her teammates have to shake their
heads.

"My teammates look at me and [say],
‘Driscoll, you are crazy.’ They look at me
and laugh,” Driscoll said. “Sometimes they
say I’ scare them. I can’t say it’s real pretty,
what I do, but it gets people excited  to
have somebody that is going nuts. It would
get me excited if I was watching me in a
big match  just going crazy.” V

Senior outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie
said Driscoll has been an important addi-
tion on the court.

“She’s very aggressive, and that’s what
we need,” Lucanie said. “We really need
people that aren’t scared to play.’ when the
game is close."  

Driscoll said that she has been asked to
be a source of intensity. ‘

“That is pretty easy for me,” Driscoll
said, “I couldn’t play any other way. My
personality and everything about me is
easy to show in a sport like volleyball. I
am a very intense person. I don’t mind
being crazy.”

Driscoll grew up with the intensity in the

“That’s just how he was,” Driscoll said.
“Let’s go. Clean the garage. It is funny
stuff. He never wanted us to be disap-

pointed because we could have done

more, we should have done more, in
everything. 
Driscoll said she just wants to do every-

thing possible to win every match.

“If I walk out of a match, and say I
should have been more intense in that
match  that would be my most disap-

A blue-chip recruit is a play-

the top—5O prep players in the
country and a “'can’t miss”

Pittsburgh would know first-

Women's
cross country
takes first ,
in city meet

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s cross coun-
try team won its first meet of
the year at the City of
Pittsburgh’s \Women’s Cross
Country Championships.

The meet was held at Robert
Colleges Moon
Township campus course,
which is located in Coraopolis,
Pa.

The Lady Panthers, a team
consisting of only six runners,
were lead by first-year athlete
Angie Martin.

Martin finished 43 seconds
ahead of the second—place f1n—
isher to become the individual

champion. Her time: 19 min— _

utes and 23 seconds.
After Martin crossed the fin-
ish line, the next two places

went to Duquesne, making for —

a possible Lady Dukes upset.

But Pitt never lost face with
the fine running of rookie
Stephanie Ellsworth and sopho-
mores Melanie Ishman, Tonia
Malloy and Natasha Van Reil,
who took the fourth, fifth, sev-
enth and eighth places, respec-
tively.

“The girls did a great job”,
head coach Steve Lewis said.
"‘This was the stiffest course
we’ve been on all year. They
ran great.” I

The men’s cross country
team wasn’t as fortunate as the
women this past weekend. Pitt
took 12th place at the 20th
Annual Paul Short Cross
Country Invitational at Lehigh
University.

The 31~team race showcased
the best teams on the East
Coast in a grueling 6.2 mile
course.

Sophomore Mike Umbleby'

had the best showing for Pitt.
Umbleby’s time of 31:28 was
good enough for 18th place out
of 210 runners.

Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team
voyaged to Miami University
this weekend to compete in

"the Big East conference tennis

championship. The over-
matched, Panthers tied for last
place with St. John’s
University. '
With powerhouses like
Miami University, Seton Hall
University and Syracuse
University in the tournament
-— which finished one, two
and three respectively ‘— the
sophomore—dominated Pitt
squad did not stand a chance
to win. Head coach George
Dieffenbach said the team’s
goal was not to finish last.
Pitt was dominated

throughout the tournament
with 0-6, 0-1, 0-2 running
consistently throughout the
scorecard. However, there
was one bright spot on the
team. The No. 5 seed Kristen
Siegel played very well in the
Flight E consolation bracket.
After getting beat 0-6, 0-6 in
the first round by Cordula
Bode of Syracuse, Siegel
came back to have the most
competitive match for Pitt.
Siegel faced off against Amy
Santaniello of Villanova
University and lost a tough

.match 3-6, 4-6.

“Siegel played very tough
for us.” Dieffenbach said. “For
a girl who just started playing
tennis not too long ago, she’s
been doing well for us.”

As far as the rest of the

team — let’s just say they
didn’t fare as well as Siegel.
The No. 1 seed Alison Baker
lost 1-6, 0-6 to Carolyn Daley
of Villanova.

Marla Zielinski, Pitt’s No. 2
seed, got skunked in both
rounds 0-6, 0-6 — first to
Kelly Barnes of Villanova and
then to Donna Lomenzo of
Boston College. The No. 3
seed Barb McCarthy followed
in Zielinski’s footsteps as she
too was shut out.

The No. 4 seed Tammy
Keister lost 0-6 in the first set
and then salvaged two games
in the second set to Sharla
Caico of Seton Hall.

Becky Elliott, the No. 6
seed, faced off against Darsi
Cocozza of the University of
Connecticut and fell 1-6, 1-6.

W/omen’s tennis falls at Big East's

In doubles competition the
scores were no better. In the
Flight A doubles Baker and
Zielinski dropped their first
match 0-6, 0-6.

McCarthy and Keister got
shutout in the first match in
the Flight B doubles and lost
their second match, 2-6. In
both matches of the Flight C
Doubles, Hillary Gordon and
Deborah Baird failed to win a

"game, losing 0-6, 0-6.

\With all the bad, there is
some good..

“We saw a lot of excellent
tennis players this weekend,”
Dieffenbach said. “When we
play these players, we learn
what we need to do  to

beat this type of competition._

This was definitely a motiva-
tional experience."

“I think they are surprised at

said. "I am here to play. That’s

Driscoll credits support from

Continued from page 3

Tom Ridge advocates
two divisions of the present
DER,_ a Department of Natural
Resources in charge of
parks and public forests, and
a Department of Environ-
mental Protection which would
handle environmental regula-
tion.

This department would be
“just as tough, maybe tougher
on violators,” said Cooper,
though it would operate on the
premise that “folks ‘are not crim-

THE PIT'I‘ NEWS, Wednesday, October '13, 1993

inals” and wish to abide by
environmental regulations.
Ridge is also “committed to

exports” and plans to make’
Pennsylvania

“a leader in
exporting,” according to
Cooper. “That will only help
create jobs in Pennsylvania.”

In order ' to “ready
Pennsylvania for the 21st centu-
ry,” Cooper said Tom Ridge will
lower taxes and “take care of
Pennsylvanians and
Pennsylvanian companies first.”

According to Cooper," Ridge is

in favor of the North America
Free Trade Agreement, though
he acknowledges some jobs
may be lost initially.

“I think NAFTA will only help
us,” Cooper said, citing that
many companies find Mexico’s
substandard communication

"and transportation systems

negate the beneﬁts of relocating
in that country for its cheap
labor.

In education Ridge said he
does not believe in a “value
component” of minimum teach-

‘Pa.

ing standards, seeing the
church, family and civic organi-
zations as better means of
instilling values in children.

Ridge is, however, in favor of
“tightening up” academic stan-
dards, said Cooper.

More details of Ridge’s educa-
tional agenda will be released in
the‘coming months.

Originally from Munhall,
Ridge graduated from Harvard
and went to law school at
Dickinson College in Carlisle,
Ridge is a decorated

Vietnam veteran and practiced
law in Erie before running for
Congress in 1982. Ridge is now
serving his sixth term in
Congress.

Cooper said Ridge can win
the general election because he
has appeal with Democrats, his
home district being heavily
Democratic.

Ridge’s district encompasses
Erie, as well as dairy country, so
Ridge has experience with
issues concerning urban and
rural constituents.
