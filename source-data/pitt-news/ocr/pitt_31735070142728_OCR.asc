The city district attorney’s office
withdrew the charges for three
people arrested during the G—2o
Summit, including one Pitt News
photographer.

Mike Manko, a spokesman
for District Attorney Stephen
Zappala’s ofﬁce, said the ofﬁce
withdrew the charges against Pitt
News photo editor Vaughn Wal-
lace “after consulting with the
Pittsburgh policeand reviewing
the evidence.”

“It was determined that Wal-
lace was ‘working with creden-
tialed media at the time,” Manko
said. ‘ _

with failure to disperse and dis-
orderly conduct while he was

on Sept. 25.

Photo of Pitt student with police cause for investigation

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Chicago police are investigating
claims that several of their of-
ﬁcers forced a Pitt student who
they arrested during last month’s
G—20 Summit to take a photo with
them.

The investigation began after
videos surfaced on YouTube de-
picting several officers surround-

ing Pitt student Kyle Kramer as
he kneeled to his knees in front of
them as they took a picture in the
middle of Forbes Avenue, outside
of the Barco Law Building.

Jody P. Weis, superintendent of ‘

the Chicago Police Department,
said in a statement that the officers
were not working for the Chicago
department at the time but had
come to work during the G-20 “on
their personal time.” -

Weis addedthat, “The Chicago

Police Department does not toler-
ate misconduct by any of its mem-
bers, regardless of whe_re it might
occur.”

Cris Hoel, Kramer’s attorney,
said neither he, nor Kramer, had
heard from the Chicago Police De-
partment.

Chicago police spokesman Mi-
chael Fitzpatrick declined to com-
ment on Hoel’s remark, saying all
he was permitted to say was that
the investigation was ongoing. He

said he did not know when "the
investigation —— which is being
conducted by the department’s
Internal "Affairs Division —— will
conclude.

Hoel said his focus right now is
not on the Chicago investigation,
but rather on resolving Kramer’s
criminal charges. A
i “A criminal record for an un-
dergraduate could affect job pros-
pects, credit —— many, many im-

portant parts of their lives as they

try to build their lives,” he said.
“My current focus is on extricat-
ing these students from criminal
jeopardy.” '

Kramer said he felt relieved
about the investigation. - ,

“I was happy to hear about it,
and I’m glad they’re looking into
it,” he said; - _

Editor’s note: Kramer is a staff
writer for The Pitt News. He was
not on assignment for the paper
at the time of his arrest.

making progress with the district
attorney’s office,” he said, “and
I’m grateful for the help_ I’ve re-
ceived from both my lawyer, col-
leagues and other friends.”

Cris Hoel, an attorney who
represents Wallace and some
other Pitt students, said with-
drawing the charges-is a “wel-
come development.”

“We are grateful to the district
attorney’s office for effecting jus-
tice in this case,” Hoel said.

He said their records will not
be cleared completely, though,
unless they file a petition to
expunge their records, which
erases any indication of an ar-
rest or criminal proceeding. Such
records can affect their abilities
to get certain jobs, he said.

Hoel said he hopes other

students’ charges are also with-

drawn.
“I represent a number of other
students who were charged and

remain hopeful that charges will

‘be withdrawn in those cases, al-

though perhaps not on terms
quite so favorable as those for
working journalists,” he said.
Dunlap said he ﬂew from
North Carolina, where he interns,

‘ for his court hearing. this week.
“It was kind of a wasted trip, '

I guess,” he said. “I’m very glad
to hear that the charges were
dropped.” _

Evans didn’t respondto a re-
quest for comment.

The charges against Vic--

tor Powell, the other Pitt News
photographer arrested while
covering the G-20 demonstra-
tions in’0akland, have not been
withdrawn.

The district attorney’s office
has withdrawn charges against
Pittsburgh Post- Gazettereporter
Sadie Gurman, who was arrested
around the same time Wallace
and Powell were.

Crowd watched from patio

Forbes Hall 4 1

Matula overheard someone talk-
ing about the ﬁre as well and went to
investigate.

Fire down the streets ofForbes

On Fifth Avenue, a separate group
had formed near the Graduate School
of Public Health on Thackeray Avenue
by1o:19 p.111. The group marcheddown
Atwood Street, took a few Dumpsters
from an alley and pushed them into
the intersection‘ near the Rite Aid on
Forbes Avenue. A

At 10:21 p.n1., asprawling crowd of
marchers nearjoe Mamas restaurant
paraded around an overuimed, ﬂam-
ing Dumpster. Salamone and others at

Forbes Hallwatched as rioters marched '

away from them and toward Schenley
Plaza. .

The rioters broke windows at the
Pitt police substation underneath the
pedestrian bridge by David Lawrence
Hall. They crossed the lawn of the Wil-
liamPittUnion and traveled up Bigelowu
Boulevard, turned right on FifthAvenue
and then turned onto Craig Street.

Police caught members of the group

onBelleﬁeldAvenue,wheretheymade g

at least one arrest around 10:37 p.m.
— the time when city police played a
recording that ordered the crowd to
disperse.

Matula, who had left Forbes Hall to
investigate, said the streetwas ﬂooded
with curious students and other by-
standers. ,’ '

“[It] would remainthatwayunlilthe
police removed them,” he said.

As hewalkeddown Forbes Avenue,
he saw that protesters had overturned
the Dumpster. He noticed several bro-
ken shop windows. He wenttothe W11-
liam Pitt Union lawn and saw police
beginning to assemble. He watched as
they drove inwithaLongRange Acous-
tic Device, a loudspeaker that sits on
top of a police truck  emits mes-
sages or sounds loud enough to induce
hearing loss. '

At 10:37 p.m., police played a pre-
recorded message through the LRAD
that declared the crowd in Schenley
Plazaan“unlawﬁ1l gathering’ ’ and said
it hadto disperse, orriskarrestor attack

the police werethreeblocks awayfrom
Forbes Hall, Matula went out onto its
second-ﬂoor paﬁo.

Around 11 p.m., Salamone stood
on her balcony and watched the street
below. She saw a group of protesters

Gyory stood on the Forbes Hall

Pepper spray used as riot gas

round three sides of the patio. Some look directly

over the street.

Matula was on the patio, too. He and Gyory
both said they never heard a warning telling the
crowd on the patio to disperse before the canisters
were thrown.

Salamone said she’d heard rumors that some?
one on the patio yelled, “Let’s riot!” or that a pro-
tester tried "to run into the hall, prompting the
police to disperse the crowd. A

She said she saw someone throw the canister
of gas back into the street— the people on the patio
didn’twantto be exposed to the gas, she said, add-
ing that she thought that prompted the police to
throw two more canisters onto the patio.

“When we saw the-canisters ﬂy, we all ran in
right away,” Gyory said.

Gyoryworkedas anemergency medical techni-
cian in his hometown near Allentown, Pa.

, He wentto theﬁrstﬂoorto check on someone

whohetlheardhadbeenhitbyarubberbulletand '

waswaitingforanambulancewhen police released
the gas. An oﬂicer in riot gearprevented Gyory and
other residents from leaving the hall. The oﬂicers
let only the two people waitingwith the person to
stand outside the front door. .

Gyory decided to check other ﬂoors. He went
tothe sixth. ,

There, he found Salamone. Shewas hyperven—
tilating, surrounded by a group of women on her
ﬂoor who tried to calm her down.

‘It feels like your eyes are melting’

Oleoresin Capsicum spray, commonly known '

as OC gas or pepper spray, isusedfor self—defense
and riot control. ,

The vaporis derivedfrom the capsicum, or red
pepper, plant. It inﬂarnes the areas ithits, resulting
inpain and discomfort so that “many victims lose
their capacity to resist,” according to a National

Criminaljustice Reference Service report given to
the U.S. Department ofjustice in 2000.

Being exposed to OC vapor raises blood pres-
sure and can affect breathing, but according to
the report, the  does not cause serious breath-
ing problems such as asphyxiation. However, the
report did not address other health conditions,
such as asthma. V '

Matula said he thought OC gas felt similar to
how he imagined tear gas would. ’

‘ “When you inhale it, your lungs and throat itch,
and you can’t do anythingbut cough,” he said. “If it
gets in your eyes, you become partially blind and
it feels like your eyes are melting.”

When police released the. gas, Matula ran and
the others on the patio,‘ stampeded back into the
building. ‘

“The situation got panicky very fast,” he said.

A Matulawas several feet from one of the gre— ‘
nades when it hit the patio.

“I ran to my bathroom on the sixth ﬂoor and
ﬂushed my eyes and choked for five minutes,”
Mat11lasaidinane—mail. “The thirdﬂoorhadwin-
dows open out ofrwhich the students had been
looking. It was ﬁlled with gas, and the students
living on thethirdﬂoorbecame refugeesfor several
hours while it clear _ .”

Gyory startedto roarnthe residencehall. When
he found Salamone surrounded by some of the
other women from her ﬂoor, he started giving
them directions. A

Salamone was able to breathe, but she was
coughing and hyperventilating. Gyory said he
didn’t want to help her directly because of legal
complications thatcanresultfrom giving aid while
off duty, but he helped tell the women what to do.
One of them was a lifeguard and had training in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Salamone said she hadn’t experienced an asth-
maattack since shewasyounger. She coughed and
her limbs felt tingly because of the lack of oxygen.

Forbes Hall 4 6

One of the two Forbes Hall resident assistants
called an ambulance, she said. Firemen gave her
oxygen while she waited.

She changed into pajamas so she wasn’t in
clothes contaminatedwiththe pepper spray. EM'I‘s
transported Salamone to the hospital, barefoot
and without her cell phone. She still has her hos-
pital bracelet.

“The nurses seemed pretty stressed,” Sala-
mone said. She said they told her several other
people had the same reaction afterbeingexposed
to the OC vapor.

UPMC didn’t respond to phone calls requesting
comment on the number of people who went to
the emergency room that night. .

Salamone received an IV and stayed in the
hospital for about an hour until campus police
drove her back to the hall, which she said she felt
grateful for. She got home early in the morning —

she said maybe around 3 am, although she said‘

her perception of time was skewed —' and slept
through her ﬁrst lecture. But in two days, she felt
she was back to normal

She was unable to comment on speciﬁcs of those
complaints, but she said the board will continue
to accept them. It is also working with University

City police spokeswoman Diane Richard said
‘she hadn’t heard of the incident at Forbes Hall
and couldn’t give a statement about it because
she wasn’t there. i’

: “I am not certain that your sources are totally
accurate in their indication that the city police
ﬁred OC [gas] inthe dormitory areato disperse a
crowd,” Richard said. _

Richard said she would ask Paul Donaldson,

' Pit1sburghdeputychiefofpolice,aboutwhathap—

pened and askforaresponse. She said the deputy
police chiefwould respond “athis discretion.”The

Pitt News e—mailed and called the police three.

times but received no further comment.

' Neither Forbes Hall residence assistants nor
Residence Life oﬂicials were allowed to comment
onwhat happened at Forbes Hall, but Pitt spokes-
manjohn Fedele said the University is working
with the city police to investigate all incidents that
occurred on campus during the G-20.

“It would be premature for us to comment I

on it while the investigation is ongoing,” Fedele
said, speaking for Vice Chancellor of Public Af-
fairs Robert Hill

‘A lot of misunderstanding’

While she was in the hospital, Salamone wor-

ried about people she knew who were stuck else-
where on Pitt’s campus and couldn’t get to their
dorms and other buildings.

There was some chaos in Forbes Hall, she i

said. It was dark out and things seemed “crazy,”
she said.‘ '

She said she felt as if the events of the night
were part of a largerproblemthatwasn’t necessar-
ilythe fault of police ofﬁcers, and she understood
where theywere comingfrom—— especiallyifthe
policewho tiirewthecanisterswerefrom out ofthe
area, or if they thought Forbes Hallwas anapart—
ment building rather than University housing.

“The police were put into weird positions,”
Salamone said. “I think it was a lot of misunder-
standing on everybody’s side.” V

Gyory said he feltpeople standingonthe patio
would have gone inside ifpolice had told them to.
He understood the police might have been afraid

ofonlookers.Hesaidthatpeople applauded police,

as they wentby the hall to show their support but
didn’tsee anythingthatmayhave prornptedpolice
to throw the ﬁrst canister. f

“Without any sort of warning whatsoever, I
think they deﬁnitely overstepped their boun ,”

Obama puffs,

passes to states

_ fter spending the week-
, Aend listening to The

Mars Volta and watching
“Harold and Kumar,” President
Obama decided to,halt federal
prosecutions of state—licensed
medical marijuana users and
providers.

So we don’t know his process,
but the Department ofjustice did
announce on Monday that it will
no longer interfere with states
that allow medical marijuana.
Righteous, dude.

The Department of Justice
said in a statement that pursuing
these prosecutions is not a good
use of time or resources, accord-
ing to the New York Times."

Until now, the federal govern-
ment actively prosecuted people
using medical marijuana, even
if they were under compliance
with their state laws, because
they were still violating federal
law. This wasted tax revenue
could be better spent ﬁghting the
spread of universally illegal nar-
cotics, including unprescribed
marijuana. It also usurped power
from doctors in their diagnoses

.of what could help unhealthy

patients. _
As the health care debate
rages in Congress and across the

, country, each side argues that

their solution will best empower
doctors, yet with medical mari-

juana, the doctors get glossed -

over. .

If a doctor thinks that a mar-
ijuana subscription is the best
thing for a patient, why should
the government stand in the
way? .

Doctors deserve our belief
that they will write these pre-
scriptions for the right reasons.

They’re already responsible for ,

prescribing addictive and poten-
tially dangerous drugs, so mari-
juana feels like an awkward place
to draw the line. While opponents
of medical marijuana certainly
have their reasons, the decision
should ultimately fall upon one’s

doctor as to whether the poten-
tial advantages are worth the

' potential drawbacks.

That isn’t liberal. lt’s respon-
sible.

By refraining from pros-
ecuting the medical marijuana

. community, Obama is actually

making a classically conserva-
tive move —— and a good one. His
decision reinforces both indi-
vidual and state rights by remov-
ing federal bureaucracy from the
process. It also provides clear,
consistent guidelines for a citi-
zenry befuddled by conﬂicting
state’ and federal laws.

Now that this contradiction

has been removed, states can.

openly debate medical marijuana
without the non-starter of ‘TWell,
it’s still illegal at the federal level,
so why bother?” The conversa-
tion has always been happen-
ing, but perhaps now it won’t.be
quite as taboo to advocate for
legalizing medical marijuana, so
our society can have an educated
debate and decide, for the right
reasons, whether or not to al-
low it. ‘

Currently, 14 states have le-
galized or decriminalized medi-
cal marijuana. Believe it or not,

, Pennsylvania is not among them.
' However, allowing and taxing

medical marijuana might allevi-
ate some of the commonwealth’s
migraine headaches from the
budget crisis, while potentially
helping medical patientswho
could be waiting for the right
treatment for them to be per-
mitted.

Next year’s gubernatorial
race has already started, and
this would make a fascinating
proposal to consider. The next
question for the federal govern-
ment will come when an espe-
cially liberal state like California
decides to decriminalize mari-
juana entirely. But that’s a very
different debate, and hopefully,
both sides of this debate will rec-
ognize it as such.

Lying helps in every situation

 
  
 

Alie Gensheimer

Most of us grew up learning that
‘although we should never lie, it is
OK to tell the occasional ﬁb.

To ﬁb, by deﬁnition, is to tell a
small or trivial lie. To lie, however,
is to speak falsely with intent to
deceive.

I have always been under the
impression that ﬁbbing is a much
smaller infraction than lying. My
mom would tell me, “If you tell a
girl you like her dress when you
really don’t, but itgmakes her feel

good about herself, that’s a ﬁb or

A awhite lie. But if you tell me you’re
going to a friend’s house, and you’re
really doing something else, that’s
a lie.”

Once I thought I had mastered
the ﬁne line between lying and ﬁb-
bing, I’ll admit, I became the ﬁbbing
queen. The problem that remains,
however, is that the line between a
ﬁb and a lie is murky at best.

Is ﬁbbing simply telling a lie to
make someone feel better?

In that case, I’ll tell my mom
I have never been drunk. That’ll
make her proud.

I’ll tell my dad that a tree fell
over and hitmy parked car instead
of admitting that somehow the
red traffic light just wasn’t bright
enough. He’ll feel much better
thinking his daughter isn’t an ir-
responsible driver.

You’re probably thinking, “Girl,
your parents would never believe
that crap,” in which case, you’re
right.

Yet if you’re anything like me,
you’ve experimented in the realm
of ﬁbs and lies to see what you can
get away with.

Unfortunately for me, I can’t get

. away with anything.

Columnist,

But with two simple steps, you
can minimize the risk factor and
make anyone believe anything.
Well, maybe.

The ﬁrst step to successful lying
is playing the part.

Now, some people are naturally
good liars. They don’t break eye
contact, breathe heavily or spill
coffee because of uncontrollable
tremors. Basically, they’re real—life
actors and actresses.

To makesomeone believe what ’

you’re saying, you_must speak casu-
ally, as though you are. stating what
- you ate for breakfast. Take a deep

breath, keep your body loose and

it requires strong compartmental-
izing skills. Based on how many
lies you’re telling at one time and

whether you’re telling the same lie _

— or some version of it -— to dif-
ferent people, youlmust keep your
lies organized.

If you possess a high-functioning
brain and really think about what
you’re saying, then you should be
OK. If you’re forgetful like me, I sug-
gestkeepinga handy lie journal.

Organize it either by person
or by lie, and then document the
details-of the lie. The drawback: It
might be just a little ‘obvious if you
referto your lie, journal mid-lie.

‘ ‘   

If you’re forgetful like me, Isuggest
keeping a handy lie journal.

remember to keep it cool.

First, say something true, and
then immediately carry over into
the lie. Toss it in without appearing
awkward. Let’s practice.

' Truth: “Yeah, I had Cheerios
for breakfast with skim milk and
a banana.” Smooth transition into
a lie: “Oh, and by the way, I don’t
have a thing for your boyfriend at
all. Totally, like, whatever. No, I
deﬁnitely don’t.”

See how it works? Easy. It just
requires some practice to get it
right. Always slip a lie in between
a lot of true statements because it’ll
be far more difﬁcult to recognize.

Let’s move on to the second step
of a great lie: keeping‘ your story
straight.

This step is more challenging, as

“So anyway, yesterday when you
called I was getting coffee with 
Hang on. Let me just look some-
thing up in my journal really quickly

 Oh yeah, I was having coffee with

Christine.”

Not so smooth. Your best bet
is to review the contents of your
journal before any social encoun-
ter so that you are on your ﬁbbing
A-game. ‘

Now, if you’re thinking that
everything I’ve told you is absurd,
you caught me. I told you I can’t get
away with anything. But if you’ll
actually implement these tips a
well, best of luck to you. Gullibility
might be abigger issue for you than

lying. ‘

Public option now
depends on Snowe

Green 4 9

Therefore, it is possible that Snowe

I will have even more influence than

Baucus or Dodd.

But the question remains: Why?
Snowe is just one senator. Why would
Democratic leadership give a Repub-
lican non-committeeleaderthis much
power? ,

Certainly not for sheer numbers.
The ﬁnance committee legislation
passed by a vote of 14-9, well above
majority. As for the overall Senate
vote, there are 58 Democrats and two
liberal—leaning Independents —.— more
than enough people to supply the 51
votes needed to pass health care re-
form without Snowe.

The only other fathomable pos-
sibilityisforthe illusion ofbipartisan-
ship, something Democratic leader-
ship  spoken to.

According to CNN, President Ba-
rack Obama has singled out Snowe
“forboththe political courage andthe
seriousness of purpose thatsheis dem-
onstrated throughout this process.”

Likewise, House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi told CNN, “I respect Sen. Snowe
and the role she has constructed, the
role shehasplayedinthe deliberations
for the Senate Finance Committee.”

Neither seemed to come out and

V explicitlysaywhatwe areallthinking:

If the Democrats were able to bring a
Republican on board and the legisla-
tion faﬂed, the failure of health care
reform could not be attributed solely
to the Democratic Party.

And yet, anyone withasense area-
son can see that this is ludicrous.

One moderate Republican does not
a bipartisan legislation make.

Not to mention, Republican
mouthpieces like Glenn Beck and

Rush Limbaugh have already viliﬁed

Snowe as a RINO, or Republican in
name only.

Following Snowe’s vote, Limbaugh
called Snowe a “predictable joke” —
and even attacked the state of Maine.

“What she cares about every six
years is voters in Maine, not voters
in Florida  I’ll tell you what it’s time
for. Goldwater had it right. Let’s just

A saw the state off and let it sail out to

sea,” Limbaugh said on his popular
radio show. ' —
And giving Snowe so much inﬂu-

ence presents aserious threatto some- ‘

thing many Democrats hold near and
dear to their big—govemment—1oving
hearts: a public health care option.
In the past, Snowe. has urged
Obama to forgo the public option in
favor of a“trigger”thatwould activate

apublicoptiononlyifprivateinsurers ‘

fail to make coverage affordable. _

It therefore stands to reason that
the conspicuous absence of a public
option in the Finance billis Snowe’s
inﬂuence —— something that could
extend to the ﬁnal legislation, a fear
that has some Democrats very, very
unhappy-

“We can’t sort of hedgeand say,
‘What’s Olympia going to do?’ We’ve go
to decide whatwe want,” Sen.Jay Rock-
efeller, D-W. Va., said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital withAl Hunt.”

The Democrats have the numbers
to pass apublic option-included health
care bill. Perhaps Democratic leader-
ship should worry less about the illu-
sion ofbipartisanship and more about
satisfying their base — 77 percent of
which supports a plan with a public
option, according to The Huffington
Post. I _

CLO Cabaret celebratesits stripes with ‘Plaid’

Forever Plaid

Oct. 8, 2009 — March 28, 2010
Theater Square Cabaret
Tickets‘ $39.50

In honor of its ﬁfth anniversary,
the Pittsburgh CLO Cabaret is host-
ing a reunion. The dress code is
plaid only.

“Forever Plaid,” a jukebox mu-
sical that highlights, the pop hits
of yesteryear through the voices
of an all-male quartet of clean-
cut singers, is returning to Pitts-
burgh to mark another milestone
in the Venue’s history. The show
will run from now until March of
next year. V

In 2004, this off-Broadway hit
was the ﬁrst performance of the
CLO Cabaret, which has been a ma-

jor name on the Pittsburgh theater
scene ever since.

The talented cast of the 2004
production is also making a come-
back, along with director and cho-
reographer Guy Stroman.

Stroman — a distant relative of
Tony Award winner Susan Stroman
— was a part of “Forever Plaid’s”
creation and directed many mount-
ings of the piece in its own 20-year
history.

“‘Forever Plaid’ is a piece I
helped develop in NYC when it was
just an idea, three monologues and
some great songs from the ‘50s and
‘60s,” Stroman said.

On the topic of the different
experiences and productions, he
said, “I direct and stage the show
that I know and that I know works.
I help each. actor ﬁnd their own
path to play these roles, and that
can feel different, but the results
and impact are always effective.”

Stroman said his experiences
with this show were some of

the most fulﬁlling of his career.
Throughout the years, he saw the
extreme excitement exhibited by
American patrons of “Forever
Plaid” and the undying loyalty of
its fans across the
pond.

He relished the
chance to work .'
with the CLO Cab-
aret and to bring
this musical to
Pittsburgh again.
Stroman acknowl-
edges that direct-
ing is a craft that
actually chose him.
His chance to com-
municate the in-
herent joys of this
show is just one of
the fringe beneﬁts
of his enlistment.

The play starts
out with four high
school friends dy-
ing in a tragic car

accident on the side of a road.

What sounds like the headline
of a particularly morbid front page
is actually thepreface of “Forever
Plaid.”

ARM processing takes a grip on notebooks

Donald Campbell
Columnist

 

The news of netbooks has essentially
been unchanged for quite some time.
The storyof'netbooks,similarly,has

:”beenrather1nvanan' ' t.

Netbooks entered the market as
extremely low-priced alternatives to
normal laptops. They sported small
screens, processors that requiredvery
little power — and, in turn, provided
very little power —-— and, out of neces-
sity, ran ultra-efﬁcient Linux-based
operating systems.

Windows was an innovation on
some netbooks as the processors be-
came more powerful and couldhandle

_._.;he more power-hungry calculations of

a Wmdows platform.

Microsoft could breathe easier as
they didwhatthey dobest—takeover
atechnology and plantalarge Wndows
ﬂagprominently on top.

Major manufacturers like Dell and
Hewlett—Packard now offer netbooks
thatareweaker and include attractively
colored case designs and run the ever-
f'riendlyMicrosoftW1ndows, afavorite
of most computer users.

seemed to ﬂourish as most netbooks
utilized the low-cost, simple and
low-powered Intel Atom processors,
coupled with Wmdows XP Home Edi-
tion. »

Trouble is brewing however —
mostly from the frequent denuncia-
tions of Wmdows XP coming from
Microsoft.

Microsoft, a company that ulti-
mately wants to put people into the
mindset that WlI1ClOWS XP is obsolete
— and thus cause them to upgrade at
considerable expense— nowpromises
netbooks that runWLndows 7.

Windows 7 has not completely
entered the market yet, but.Microsoft
seems conﬁdentthatitwill replaceWm-
dowsXPasthenextnetbookopera1ing
system of choice. ,

Because it is a Windows platform
and therefore compatiblewith around
95 percent of the computer-buying
public, Wmdows 7 may very well take
overthe netbookarenaand preventthe
original Linuxnetbooksfrom develop-
ing ﬁirthermarketshare.

The original concept behind net-
books mightbelostas aresult.A1though
Microsoftwmdowscanrunonthe cut-
down, low-cost netbook machines,

the demands of Wmdows commonly °~

require the netbooks to sport faster
and more expensive Atom processors
thanwouldbe requiredfor comparable
Linux machines.

This requirement plus the licens-
ingcoststoputwmdows onarnachine
raises the cost of the average Wmdows
netbooks when compared with its Li-
nux brethren. ‘ R

The original EEPC, which ran a Li-

book became inﬂated and signiﬁcantly
closed the gap between netbooks and
the cheap full—sized laptops that run
Pentium Dual-Core processors.

A recent article in Computerworld
written by Steven]. Vaughan-Nichols,

ternative to a scenario of Microsoft’s

Copland: Ezsazon Mexico
Barber: Adagio for strings

Zealand duo, Bret McKenzie and
Jermaine Clement, sets the less-
thanjserious tone of the band’s
second studio album, “I Told You
I was Freaky.” I

The songs from the album
were featured on season two of
the band’s HBO series, and 10 of
the 13 tracks were pre—released
on iTunes —- one per week after
their TV debuts.

The album comes with one

v sticker and four badges, as well as

a lyric book with guitar chords.

As per usual, McKenzie and
Clement don-’t shy away from
any genre. They tackle rap, R&B,
folk and rock with both soul and
satire.

The rap songs, such as “Hurt
Feelings,” are particularly enter-
taining, coming from two white
guys with funny accents.

The sheer ridiculousness of
the lyrics and songs are fun for

. fans of the show, but those new

to the Conchords might need to
check out the show before fully
appreciating the duo’s humor.

be compared to a full—blown musical. ‘

“The more instruments you’ve got,
the more songs you canproduce,” said
McGinty.

Attractingthe widest audience goes
handinhand with Celtic Thunder’s mis-
sion, which is not just to make money
by selling records, but to make people
happy, McGinty said.

and Sparky the chance to perform their
dream show.

Thanks to the original direction, chore-
rography, libretto by Stuart Ross and a score
that assembles some of the 1950s’ most well
known songs (including “Cry” and “Love Is
A Many Splendored Thing”),

“Plaid” has been called off—Broadway’s
No. 1 show and sold more than $300 million
in tickets. It pervaded the relative obscurity

that is characteristic of off-Broadway shows
and reached the mainstream. _

Unbeknownst to the folks at Webster’s
Dictionary, late night television personal-
ityjay Leno coined a phrase to describe the
millions of ardent devotees that the show
has acquired over its long history — “plaid
heads.”

Some celebrity plaid heads include Liza
Minnelli, Jason Alexander, Rosie O’Donnell

and Tommy Hilﬁger. ‘

“Forever Plaid’s” returning cast of lead-
ing men from the 2004 production, Chris
Crouch (Frankie), J.D. Daw (Jinx), Joseph
Domencic (Smudge) and Marcus Stevens
(Sparky) hope to create a new group of plaid
heads from this season’s crop of Pittsburgh’s
theatergoers.

After Villanova victory, Panther soccer team sets school shutout record and nears the team’s win record

Diana Connor I Senior Staff Photographer
The Panthers have found success, thanks to strong defensive play.

Lauren Kirschman
‘Senior Staff Writer

When opponents face the Pitt wom-
en’s soccer team, they know scor-
ing on one of the top defenses in the
country won’t be easy.

Pitt’s defense set a school record
for the most shutouts in a season
(nine) with its win over Villanova
Sunday. The victory also brought
the Panthers closer to the Univer-
sity’s win record -— one more victory
gives the team eight wins and ties
the record.

Pitt head coach Sue-Moy Chin
said this Panther defense is the best
she’s seen in her seven years as head
coach and has been the strongest
part of the team this season.

“Their understanding over the
past couple of years playing in the
system has gotten better, so they’ve
gotten better,” Chin said. “Add that

with the experience of playing to-
gether and the records they’ve set,
and they are [the] best.”

Pitt’s backﬁeld consists of senior
Maura Caslin, juniors Kat Weller and

. Rebecca Fraser and sophomore

Brittany Pfaff, prior to her ankle
injury.

Chin said that after Pfaff’s injury,
freshman Abby Baldys did a good job
of stepping in, learning the situation
on the field and being productive
for the team.

The Panthers are tied for third
in the Big East for goals allowed and
are ﬁfth in goals against average with
0.62 goals.

Starting goalkeeper Morie
Kephart has seven shutouts this
season — a season record — and
is also the team’s a11—time shutout
leader with 12. She is second in the
Big East this season with a 0.51 goals
against average and ﬁrst in save per-
centage with .910.

«:

When Kephart broke the record
for most shutouts in a season, she
credited the entire defense for her
success. '

“We all work together to form
an effective unit,” Kephart said. “I
demand a lot out of them, and they
demand a lot out of me.”

But Kephart isn’t the only goal-
keeper ﬁnding success on the ﬁeld.

Backup goalkeeper Alison Finch
shut out Notre Dame on Oct. 4, keep-
ing the Fighting Irish scoreless for
the ﬁrst time since 2006. Notre
Dame is second in the Big East in
goals per game, followed by Con-
necticut, against whom the Panthers
will end the season.

Pitt has played against several
high—powered offenses this season.
Chin said she’s been impressed with
her backﬁeld’s ability to hold them
to long shots and her goalkeepers’
capability of stopping those shots
when they come.

Freshman Lewis on pace to break scoring record

Panthers ranked No. 20 after weekend slaying of the Scarlet Knights

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

Rutgers’ strong rushing defense
was no match for Pitt freshman
running back Dion Lewis, who
was named Big East offensive
player of the week Monday.
Before Friday night’s matchup,
the Scarlet Knights ranked first in
the conference and sixth nation-
ally in rushing defense, having

allowed only 65.2 yards per game _

and 2.3 yards per attempt.

But Lewis ran for 180 yards
and two touchdowns, including
a 58-yard touchdown run late in
the third quarter, as he led the No.
20 Panthers to a 24-17 victory in
Newjersey.

Pitt head coach Dave Wannst-
edt said Lewis’ work ethic is
largely responsible for his strong
numbers during his freshman
campaign.

“The consistency that Dion
has demonstrated has been un-
believable, on the field and off

the ﬁeld,” Wannstedt said. “He’s
doing everything right. He’s such
a- great kid. Very few freshmen
can make that transition and
maintain it.”

Lewis’ third—quarter score,
which gave the Panthers a 24-
10 lead, provided the winning
points. ‘

He also had a one-yard touch-
down run in the second quar-
ter. '

The Rutgers game was Lewis’
fourth 100-yard rushing perfor-
mance of the season.

His success so far this season
is no surpr_ise to Wannstedt, who
said Lewis’ homecoming perfor-
mance against the Scarlet Knights
was a great response to the atten-
tion he’s received this year.

“When your name’s being
thrown around maybe as a Heis-
man Trophy candidate, and you

5 go back home to play as close to

home as he’s going to get, and
you show up and play like he did
 there are some really special

The Pitt women’s volleyball team found--itself
in a dogﬁght in its opening game.

The Panthers led Notre Dame 24-21 in the‘
ﬁrst set of Saturday’s match after breaking
away from dead-even play leading up to
that point. ’

All Pitt needed was one point to secure a
win over the No. 16-ranked Irish.

But the Panthers spoiled two chances and
were deadlocked with the Irish for ﬁve more
points before losing the set 32-30.

. The Panthers held set point six times
in the opening set before losing both that
set and the match to the Irish 3-0. But Pitt
did not lose a set by more than four points
throughout the match.

“It was disappointing that we couldn’t
take the ﬁrst set from them,” Pitt head coach
Toby Rens said. “That would’ve certainly
changed the toneof the rest of the match.”

JuniorAmy Town led the Panthers against
the Irish, notching a double-double on the
day with 13 kills and 15 digs.

Town also led the Panthers and a crowd
of 1,123, most of which donned white shirts
for a White Out promotion, in singing the
national anthem before the game.

Senior Meagan Dooley contributed 10
kills and four blocks to the game, while ju-
nior Imani Harper added eight kills and
three blocks. .

A win against the Irish would have put
Pitt in a-tie atop the conference standings.
The Panthers (14-8 overall, 6-2 Big East)
now sit alone at fourth place.

“It was a pretty good match —- lots of
high-level volleyball, just not the outcome
we wanted,” Rens said. “ [The Irish] are well-
deserving of the success they have had. They

have a lot of experience on the court with
six seniors that have all been starting for a
couple years.”

Rens said Notre Dame came through in
the clutch points to defeat the Panthers.
' “They’re a very good team, and they
earned it,” he said. “But I think we made
good progress, considering Notre Dame
is returning ﬁve starters and a libero from
last year, and we lost ﬁve seniors and four
starters at that.” I

The Panthers rebounded from a loss to

Notre Dame to sweep DePaul 3-0 Sunday.

Town again led the Panthers with 13
kills, whil/e Dooley tallied 12 kills and thre
blocks. , i

It was the Panthers’ turn to lead DePaul
in the opening set of the game, in which
they won 25-23.

The opening game put the Panthers on _

the winning track.

“That was good to see the turnaround
after a big match like Notre Dame,” Rens
said, “We came back and we were in com-
plete control, deﬁnitely in the second and.
third sets.”

. Rens said it took poise for the Panthers
to bounce back against DePaul.

“I thought we did a really good job of.
taking care of things on our side of the net,
playing good defensively,” Rens said.

The Panthers, who are in the middle of
a rare three-game homestand, will face off
against West Virginia (13-10, 3-5) Friday
in the volleyball version of the Backyard
Brawl. ‘

“[West Virginia] is having a great sea-
son,” Rens said. “It’s nice knowing we’re
going to be home again, and it will be a little
different preparing for one match this week
instead of two. We’ll have more time to focus
on game preparation.”

There’s this photo I have taped to

my-news desk. It ran in the Pitt
News the day after the Panthers
defeated Xavier in the Sweet 16
andadvanced to Elite Eight for the
ﬁrst time since 1974.

-;It’s a great photo of Levance

Fields. It was taken rightafter

the=Panthers_,;who trailed 54-5,2 ,

with less than a minute remaining,

mounted. a 'comeba.ck.in-the ﬁnal '

   

secondsiiof the ga_1nev.' .

' ,Looking for a player who ‘knew

how to takecontrol of game when

his team needed him? That was

Fields.

Down by two, late in the game,
Fields hit a seemingly impossible
three-point fade—away jumper to
give Pitt a one-point lead. Seconds
later, with the Musketeers look-
ing to take the lead from the Pan-
thers, Fields stepped up and stole
the ball before putting in an easy
layup with about 24 seconds left

in the game. - _ —

The crowd is in a frenzy and
Fields, with his hands raised, is
showing all the emotions of the
game. i

That was the photo, and that
was a great game. _

But that was last season, and

, Fields is no longer with the Pan-

thers. There is also no Dejuan Blair
and no Sam Young. V V .
Theyare a tough trio of players
forfans to replace.--But for head
coach Jamie‘":Dixon, that’s not a
problem. He’s seen it before and
will most likely see itagain. : _
“I ‘know _h_‘at it looks like on

paper, but fortunately for us, we’ve

never really lo oked at that,” Dixon
said. “We’veT-told guys to elevate
their game. We’ve always had guys
surprise people, and I would an-
ticipate the same thing happening
again this season. I can’t tell you
speciﬁcally who it will be, but I’m
sure it will be a couple guys, and I
have some ideas.”

I have a couple ideas myself.

Heading into the 2009-10 cam-
paign, there are two players who

 

will compete for the starting point
guard position, which Fields left
vacant.

Travon Woodall, a redshirt
freshman who sat out all of last sea-

son, and sophomore Ashton Gibbs, _

who led the Big East in three-point

» shooting percentage last year, will

both have their chance to make an
impact this season.

, 7l.That was the photo, and

jgthat was a great game.

While both Woodall and Gibbs
will see a lot of action, look for
Gibbs to start the season at that
position. He competed with the
United States Under-19 team in the
FIBA World Championships over
the summer, and his teammates
say he returned from the competi-
tion a lot faster and smarter with

the ball.

Dixon, who coached the Under-
19 team to a gold medal, isn’t wor-
ried about the loss of Fields and is
happy with the situation that the
team is in.

“We took two very good point
guards in the same class and two
guys that can play together too for
this reason,” Dixon said. “You lose
a guy, a very good player, but we
couldn’t be in a better situation
than we are. We couldn’t be in a
better position there where we are
with these two guys.”

Even though younger players
are ready to improve their game
and presence on the court, the
loss of three seniors - Tyrell Biggs,
Fields and Young -has also raised

questions as to who will be the‘

team’s veteran leader.
The Panthers have only one re-
turning starter in seniorjermaine

Dixon. The only other senior on the

teamis newcomer Chase Adams.
Despite some injury setbacks dur-
ing the summer and the beginning
of the fall season, Dixon is ready to
lead the young team.

  Here’s hoping for a picture-perfect season”,

“I deﬁnitely feel comfortable
[with a leadership role],” Dixon
said. “The players that left last year
—— even Dejuan as a sophomore —
I learned a lot from them.” ,

At his junior college, Dixon was
one of two sophomores who were
the only returning players on their
team, so this situation isn’t much
different for him.

“I’ve been in this role before,”
he said. “And I take it up as a chal-
lenge.” A

,Dixon’s expectations and
Gibbs’s role give some conﬁdence
to a basketball team that isn’t
ranked or even discussed as a Big

East contender. .-r

But that’s ﬁne for this team
because the program has been in
situations like this before. And just
like in the past, this team will over-
come losses, see leaders emerge
and challenge expectations.

That’s good news because may-
be Iwill get to see a photo of Gibbs,
Dixon or another player celebrat-
ing a Sweet 16 victory.

‘ And I’ll hang .that one up -
right next to the one of Fields.

qualities about him as a person, in addition
to his talent,” Wannstedt said.

For the year, Lewis has rushed for nine
touchdowns and 918 yards. He has the

.,second-highest rushing total in the coun-
try. He has also caught 12 passes for 82
yards and one touchdown.

Lewis is averaging 131.14 rushing yards
and 8.57 points per game, which ranks
him third and 25th in the nation, respec-
tively.

Over seven games, Lewis has scored
60 total points and is on pace to break
Pitt’s freshman scoring record (90) set by
LeSean McCoy in 2007.

Along with his conference honors, Lew-
is was also named the Rivals.com national
freshman of the week.

Lewis and the Panthers (6-1 overall, 3-0
Big East) sit atop the conference standings

and will host South Florida (5-1, 1-1) on‘

Saturday at Heinz Field.

“The backﬁeld is not allowing players to get
us in a lot of dangerous situations,” Chin said.

‘“They’ve been good with the ball and starting

our attack. I can’t say enough about them and
what they’ve done for us this year.” i

Chin said defense is something on which
the team concentrates every year, beginning
with preseason workouts. The coaches practice
with the Panthers to move from individual to
group to complete team defense.

She said defense is a team concept, where -

the players start from the front and work to-
ward the back. '

“Every year, we want to make sure we are A

solid and sure in the back,” Chinsaid. “We talk
to our forwards about how when they turn it
over, they put pressure on our backline.”

She said Weiler and Caslin are the center
of the backﬁeld for the Panthers.

Weiler was named the Big East defensive
player of the week on Oct. 6. She started every
game this season, while leading the team in

minutes. Caslin has also started every game
this year. .

“They are the organizers for the defense,
and they’ve been consistent for us throughout
the years,” Chin said. “They have determina-
tion and an understanding of how to play.
Their focus has been really impressive.”

Chin said she has noticed those character-
istics carry over to the rest of the backﬁeld and
the goalkeepers. Combined with the team’s
overall experience, those qualities make up
one of the best defenses in the Big East.

“It’s very impressive with the teams that

. we play in the conference, with the amount

of goals that those teams usually score,” Chin
said. “Our defending and organization helps
us eliminate a lot of different attacks and of-
fenses.”
