 Extra Building Obtained

 For Engineering Labs

Crowded Setup

 Causes Leasing
Of Old Eldifice

‘Crowded by the University’s
defense training courses, the
School of Engineering has moved
its department of industrial en-
gineering and part of its defense
training work to the old build-
ing of Shadyside academy, More-
wood and Ellsworth avenues, ac-
quired last week by the Univer-
sity Dean Elmer A. Holbrook re-
vealed Wednesday. Classwork in
the new location has already be-
gun.

I The building, leased for one year,
will be used for all undergraduate
laboratory work in industrial en-
gineering, graduate class and lab-
oratory courses of the same de-
partment, and for the production
planning and control courses of
the defense training program. In
addition, the physical education de-
partment will use the playing ﬁeld
adjacent to the building.

One Year Lease

1 Dr. John Weber, secretary of the
University, stated that the ‘build-
ing has been leased for one year
with the possibility of continuing
the lease at the end of the time.

f Dean Holbrook of the Schools of
Engineering and Mines stated, “On
account of the large number of stu-

? dents enrolled for the engineering

defense training courses, it became
necessary to _ﬁnd additional labora-
tory and class room space. Ac-
cordingly, arrangements have been
made by which the old Shadyside
academy will be used.”
- Joseph S. Lambie, director of the
University’s defense training pro-
gram, revealed that approximately
$1,000 outside students enrolled -in
the special courses. This is almost
wice as many as the School of En-
gineering could handle without ad-
ditional facilities. ,
Instruction in the special engi-

neering co‘ rses started this week. "

Class and“ aboratory work in pro-
duction engineering courses, more
than one-fourth of the special pro-
gram, started Tuesday evening in
the.‘ new location. H. H. Rothrock,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of industrial engineering, and
hisstaff have established new head-
quarters of the department there.

Classes Day and Night

Daytime work will mainly in-
clude laboratories in the under-
graduate industrial engineering
courses. Evening instruction will
be ‘given over to the special non-
credit defense training courses. In
addition, some graduate classes in
industrial engineering, and classes
in metallurgical engineering will be
conducted.

[Besides production engineering,
the University’s defense job train-
ing program offers: mechanical
drawing and descriptive geometry,
machine design, and metallurgical

engineering.
The University is conducting
these non-credit, tuition-free

Graper to Talk
On Aid to Allies
At Town Meet

An analysis of possible con-
gressional action in the seventy-
seventh Congress will be presented
by Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the department of po-
litical science, at Pitt Town Meet-
ing next Monday at 2:30 o’clock in
244 Cathedral, announces Esther
Marcuson, C41, chairman.

Dr. Graper will also interpret and
deﬁne the foreign and domestic
problems of the present national
administration. He will discuss
concern of more immediate aid to
Great Britain as well as the pro-
gram of America’s rearmament.

This is the ﬁrst of Pitt Town
Meetings to be presented in con-
junction with the plan to interpret
and analyze U. S. policies, foreign
and domestic, for the students of
the University. The plan calls for
a weekly analysis of current events
by some member of the faculty.

Dr. Graper was one of six faculty
members who spoke at a series of
current—event sessions at the last
summer sessions.

The next Pitt Town Meeting calls
for a panel discussion on the sub-
ject of general education in which
various members of the faculty will
participate.

Panther Quintet
Seek to Regain
Lost Prestige

Penn State Provides
Hurdle Tomorrow

Learning from bitter experience,
says the proverbial self-made man,
is what brings success. And Doc
Carlson is hoping that the expe-
rience his boys picked up in their
tough battle with Westminster will
help him solve some of the problems
that Penn State’s Lions are set tr
throw against the Panthers tomor-
row night.

John Lawther’s “sliding zone” de-
fense has been a particular plague
of the Pittites, and Carlson’s big-
gest problem .is to ﬁnd the system
that will go consistently well against
a zone. Against Westminster’s tight
defense the Panthers at times were
completely helpless.

And there are other ﬂaws in this
Pitt machine that the high-ﬂying
Lions may capitalize on. The
Panthers still foul too often, still
miss too many of their own foul
shots, and still haven’t, found the
combination that can play consist-
ently smooth basketball.

Along with Barrand Baltimore,
the probable starting ﬁve of the in-
vaders shows Dick Grimes,‘ John
Silan, and Elmer -Gross. But the

Staters have a‘ well-balanced squad -

and will probably shoot several re-

serves into the battle. V

Esquire Ball Publicity Reaches

A publicity stunt to climax lall
publicity stunts, and for the ﬁrst
time using..an airplane to promote a
University affair, has been ar-
ranged for this ' afternoon at 1
o’clock when Ralph Kallock, C42,
chairman of the ‘Esquire Ball, will
ﬂy over Frick acres to distribute
more gifts with the compliments
of the Esquire ball committee.

~ Three hundred snowballs,‘ such
as those used at the freshman win-
ter carnival, will be dropped from
the plane Each snowball will bear
a certiﬁcate entitling the student
ﬁnding one to a prize. The prizes,
300 in number, will include a sub-
scription to a popular magazine,
an “Annie Oakley,” one reserva-
tion, and a number of gift cartoons
by outstanding cartoonists, If the
weather is “zero—zero,” the stunt
will be carried out Mondaay.

This is but one of the unique fea-
tures of the ball. Another will be
the featured showing of originals of
cartoons of famous cartoonists at the
dance. Tickets will be printed as
formal invitations, obtainable at the
Esquire ex-change center on Wed-
nesday, Thursday, and Friday of
next week from 1:30 to 4:30 o’clock,
and in the dean of men’s ofﬁce from
8:30 to 5:30 o’clock:. Today will
climax ticket sales by committee
members.

Jan Savitt, maestro of the violin
and sweet adaptation of the classics,
will furnish the tuneful tempos. Al-
lan de Witt is the featured vocalist
of the Top Hatters.

Because of the ASCAP-BMI con-
troversy, the dance will not be
broadcast, but there will be no in-
terference with the type of smooth
music the students want.

Research Bureau Studes, Staff
Leave for Gotham Convention

Students enrolled in the Research
Bureau for Retail Training are
starting the ne.w year by taking a
vacation. That is, some people
would call it a vacation.

Tomorrow morning at 8:30 o’clock
the entire bureau, both staff and
student body, will leave the Penn-
sylvania station for New York
where they will attend the thirtieth
annual convention of the National
Retail Dry Goods association at
Hotel Pennsylvania. Students will
stay at Hotel Taft. The convention,
using as its theme, “Keeping in
Step with National Defense,” be-
gins Monday and ends next Fri-
day.

On Monday the students and staff
will go to Patterson, N. J., where
they will visit an underwear fac-
tory. Tuesday they will be con-
ducted through the plant of the
New York Daily News.

The student body will meet with

bureau alumni at the bureau alum-
ni luncheon at Hotel Governor Clin
ton, on Wednesday. Many of these
alumni are already in business in
New York, while others will come
from various states to attend the
convention.

Besides attending sessions of the
convention, the students will visit
ofﬁces of resident buyers and man-
ufacturers’ showrooms. They also
plan to make a tour through Macy’s
department store on Saturday
morning, when they will observe
the setup and displays of the vari-
ous departments. One of their ar-
signments is to report on New
York store advertising.

The students also hope to visit
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
the Museum of Modern Art, the
Museum of Costume Art, and the
Museum of Science and Industry.
The latter two are located in Rock-
efeller center.

llepartment of Fine Arts Sponsors Exhibition 1
For Tour of \VesI;ern Pennsylvania Colleges

First in a series of exhibitions that
the department of ﬁne arts is col-
lecting to circulate among interest-
ed colleges in western Pennsylvania
is the “Five Centuries of Men an.d
Manners” exhibit which opens in
the fine arts gallery today.

The exhibit conforms with the
general policy of the University to
come into closer contact with col-
leges in this region.

The exhibit consists of 50 pic-
tures, facsimile reproductions of
drawings taken from publications
owned by the ﬁne arts department.

The pictures illustrate everyday
life of the Italian, German. Dutch,
Flemish, French, English and Span-
ish people from the ﬁfteenth to the
nineteenth -century. They also show
scenes of social gatherings, court
sessions, market scenes, peasantry,
town and country life, religious pro-
cessions and tavern interiors, every
type of life included in “genre”
scenes.

The works are executed in a va-
riety of media, pen and ink, water-
color, pencil, chalk, wash drawings,
and charcoal sketches.

Artists represented in the show

include Rembrandt, Watteau, Char-
din, Bellini, Ostade, Degas, Goya,
Hogarth, Durer, and Brueghel.

Purpose of the exhibit is to show
some contemporary life from each
century included. The eighteenth
century in France and the seven-
teenth century in the Netherlands
have been stressed because the
“genre” subjects were more popu-
lar during these periods.

The exhibit will be shown in the
ﬁne arts gallery on the seventh floor
for a short time before it is circu-
lated among the colleges.

Kreimer, C42, reported. This
room. designed exclusively for
men and women students who
carry their lunches to school,
will supplement the new Tuck
Shop now under construction on
the ground ﬂoor.

Kreimer’s committee also an-
nounced that the eighth ﬂoor Men’s
Tuck Shop will continue to operate
throughout the present school year.

The January meeting, which ad-

-journed shortly after 8:30 o’clock,
was one of the shortest SFA meet- '

ings of the year and consisted al-
most entirely of committee reports
and committee appointments.

with the Libyan campaign.

From Bulletins From Britain, we see that “the victory over
the Italians has been described as the ‘third miracle’——the ﬁrst
having been the withdrawal from Dunkirk and the second the

defeat of the Luftwaffe’s attack on Britain.”

The Bardia episode was a British victory, unless of course
one Wishes to accept the Italian version found below. However
Dunkirk was not a British victory in the accepted sense and

neither has been the air-war over England.

Concerning the fall of Bardia, II Popolo Italiano, Philadel-
phia daily Italian language newspaper, serves up a lesson in
unorthodox military tactics when it quotes the Rome radio the
night "after the fall of the Libyan stronghold, “Dal punto di
vista militare, la offensiva inglese nel Nord Africa lascia le cose
com’erana, tranne che agevola il successo della controffensiva

ogni Volta che l’Italia decida di lanciarla.”

A free translation records as follows, “From the military ,

point of view, the English offensive in North Africa leaves
things as they were, other than it will help the success of the
counter offensive any time that Italy will decide to launch it.”
We are n-ot in the advanced ROTC unit, but we can tell
that both the Italian and British claims prove the old military
axiom,‘ “We have the enemy right where he wants us.”

ON THE RECORD: Every now and then a swing
artist becomes so ﬁne in his ability to perform on his
instrument that his records become classics that can
be seriously compared with works which have been
recorded as legitimate music. Blind, colored pianist
Art Tatum ﬁlls this bill completely. To use phrases
such as hep cat, jive man, and solid sender would slan-
der him.

His records are all in perfect taste, with not a note
out of mood or tempo. All the hidden depths and
nuances of his touch which honkatonck uprights never
felt come to light on the studio Steinway, giving full
range and balance to his already marvelous improvi-
sations.

Some of his best sides are Liza, Anything For You,
Deep Purple, The Shout, and The Sheik of Araby. If
you are one of the many who think that Eddy Duchin
is as hep as they come——just dig a few of these sides
and hold tight. If you still want Duchin, just come
around, and I’ll make a sandwich using my Art Tatum
records in place of bread.

LONGHAIR NOTES: You’ll want to hear Rossini’s
Semiramide (Say-mee-rah’-mee—day) Overturve as re-
corded by Arturo Toscanini and the New York Phil-
harmonic. The Italian opera-going public of 1823 was
unmoved by the proud and noble themes of this mag-
niﬁcent overture, even though it must have been startled
by the sweeping opening climax which seems to grow
with fateful persistence. The third, and most typical,
side of the overture opens with a difficult theme car-
ried by the clarinet and the ﬂute, which is soon fol-
lowed by three earspliting crashes. (Rossini wanted to
be sure that his audience knew that his opera was be-
ginning.) A magniﬁcent forte half-inch follows which
leads on to a Violin “bridge passage” in which the
wonders of modern recording are shown. The guts
of this orchestra’s 40 odd strings cruise me. The work
is technically very difficult and must have been very
hard to record because of the tremendous volume range
which Mr. Toscanini draws from the orchestra. The
recording is handled in typical “Toscanini style,” which
means, as you know, nothing short of perfection.
(Victor).

We Expose TheAncient Habit
Of Fish M ongerizrig: A Parable

[Editor’s note-——We have often wondered what we are getting’ out of
college. A lot of it is education in the old sense, learning of dates, names,
Here and there through our courses, however, come a
few items which stand out above the general mass of information: things
which we remember because they are unusual or humorous or especially
timely. The following is an historical anecdote as told by Dr. Amundson

transferred to the written word by

its branches together and shot the
propaganda to “the people.”

They distributed pamphlets, with-
out any indication that they had
really come from the royal print-
ing press, among the taverns, and
these old inns, which had always
been the seat of peaceful political
discussions, became veritable hot-
beds of agitation against thecrown.

“My friends,” the people read,
“You“ should know that the famous
English-woven wool is being pulled
over your eyes. Let’s look at the
record. Let’s raise our voices in
defense of those principles for
which our forefathers have so glori-
ously perished. Have you been eat-
ing ﬁsh?

OWrite, Wire, Cable

“Get in touch with your repre-
sentative in the privy council now!
Write immediately! Don’t put it
off until tomorrow! DO IT NOW!”

And so incensed were the lusty
revellers that they kicked the
buxom barmaids from their laps
and rushed to the nearest pony ex-

press. And the local squires were
‘swamped with warnings. “We want
fish!” the citizenry cried. “The ﬁsh

market must not collapse.”

So the squires elected a delega-
tion whichwent to the queen. “We
say, old girl, don’t you think some-
thing ought to be done about this
beastly ﬁsh situation?’ they queried.
“What say, you issue some sort of
an edict bringing the ﬁsh and the
people together? What say?”

OAS If She Didn’t Know

“My dear fellows,” that gracious
lady replied, “I had no idea, really.
Of course, this too too situation
shall be adjusted immediately. An-
noying, what?”

And the squires went home and
assured the taxpayers that ﬁsh
would become the national dish.

And the barmaids climbed back
on the revellers’ laps and every-
body was happy, including the ﬁsh
mongers, thinking that they had
put an idea into the queen’s head,

and had saved the English ﬁsh
market.

But that was during the sixteenth

centur , and things don’t happen
like that today.

Johnson Will Address

has disappeared. I hardly think I could
have dropped it. for the crash would have
attracted my attention. Thus—well, you

be asked and a reward will be given for

Developing better apparatus of many kinds at lower cost
is a continuous process in the Bell System. It plays a major
part in making your telephone service the finest and cheapest
in the world. Here is one of many cases in point:

Above you see two telephone loading coils—one old, one
new. Such coils are spaced at regular intervals along tele-
phone circuits. They reduce electrical losses . . . help to bring
your voice through clearly, strongly over long distances.

Through the years, engineers at Bell Telephone Labora-
tories have succeeded in making these coils smaller and
smaller. In so doing, they have greatly reduced the cost per
coil, which...multiplied by the millions in use...l1as helped

to keep the cost of out-of-town. service low.

Why not telephone home at least once (1 week?
long Distance rates to most points are lowest
any night offer 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

At times the leaderless Panthers
looked helpless as the Titans actu-

when they attempted to work the
ball in for close shots.‘ With the
injection of a dose of ﬁght into the
team in the person of awkward but
sharp-shooting Larry Paffrath and
smooth-passing Tay Malarkey, Pitt
showed ﬂashes of the class that Doc
Carlson hopes his boys will have
against Penn State tomorrow night.

But this Pitt team does have
courage and it can ﬁght when the
chips are down. It has three prov-
en reserves and several others who
have played heads-up ball in the
few minutes of action they’ve seen.

From Penn State’s record, the
Panthers will need all the ﬁght and
all the experience they can muster
to beat back the challenge of the
Nittany Lions. Basketball profes-
sor John'Lawther comes here‘ ‘in

Cornell, Alabama, and NYU fea-
ture the six team schedule set for
Pitt’s first week of riﬂe team com-
petition. ,Florida, Drexel, Iaand
North Georgia round out the rest
of the schedule which will be ﬁred
today as a postal match.

Alabama and NYU will be op-
posed under ROTC regulations and
the rest under varsity, with the
exception of Cornell, which will be
shot under both regulations.

Five veteran shooters make pros-
pects look good for the ﬁrst season
under coaches Wills and Havlak.
Townsen, two year letter man and
captain, is still holding up as the
ace of the squad.

Gerry Haywood, Larry Laspada,
Vick Bridges, and Joe Weissman
are listed in the top ﬁve positions.

Michigan Swimmers . . .

. best in the collegiate ranks
last year, will help Pitt open its
1941 swimming season at the PAA
pool, Thursday evening, January
16, Coach Ben Grady announced
today.

Table tennis has been a cut and
dried affair for the past three years
as Delta Tau Delta walked easily
through all their meets. This year
strength is evenly divided among
all teams, and the Delts’ hopes of
repeating their breeze in is very
dim.

Losing “Ham” Hamilton and Jim-
my Kennedy from last year’s com-
bination does not mean much, since
the addition of Jim Klein should
more than make up the difference.
At 9 o’clock tomorrow morning on
the Trees gym tables, the Delts will
cross paddles with an unknown
Kappa Sig four.

ule shows Phi Epsilon Pi playing
Phi Delta Theta at 10 o’clock in

Of Athletes Slated for Army Duty

By Bob Stoderell

Eclgar “Special Delivery” Jones
may be lugging a riﬂe for old Uncle
Sam next fall, instead of lugging
the pigskin for the Pitt Panthers.
At least three varsity men will
probably be missing from the line-
up next fall b cause of the new
draft bill.

Coach Bobby Hoel’s boy, Bill
Benghauser, the hardest charging
tackle on the football ﬁeld and one
of next year’s probable starters, re-
cently received his draft papers
from the war department. John
Stahl, the lad who caught the long
pass to set up the score against Ne-
braska two years ago, will also
have to cast aside his books and
football togs, in July for khaki,
shirt and army riﬂe.

Students interested in trying out
for the 1941-42 cheerleading squad
are invited to attend a meeting next
Wednesday in the Cathedral gym
at 1:30 o’clock, announces Karl
Oermann, instructor in physical ed-
ucation.

Purpose of the meeting is to dis-
cuss plans for the organization "of
a tumbling aand cheerleading class
from which members of the cheer-
leading squad will be selected.

Until recently cheerleaders did no
tumblingat football gaames, “The
introduction of tumbling while lead-
ing cheers was made with the hope
of making the performance of
cheerleaders more spectacular,”

says Mr. Oermann.

Dr. William E. Brinker, assistant
professor of chemical engineering,
is in charge of cheerleaders, and
Mr. Oermann collaborates with Dr.
Brinker by teaching tumbling to the
cheerleaders. ‘

 
   

To add a little variety, Tex Hinte,
whose local number is 277, will be
called back to join the West Vir-
ginia National Guardsmen. Further
dissection of the football team
shows that Bill Dutton, Jones’ fresh-
man halfback twin, may be packing
a knapsack for the allotted year,
\ hile the new ﬁnd at quarterback,

has a slight pos-

nouncement Tuesday of the forma-
tion of a chapter of the Committee
to De"end America by Aiding the
Allies among the students and fac-
ulty members of the University.

Louis W. H. Johnston, instructor
in political science, was one of the
critics of the Committee’s program,
as he pointed out to questioners
that he would like to know what
was meant by opposition to appease-
iner-t, a plank in the program of
the new group.

Pointing out that if appeasement
is a bad word, it means nothing,
Mr. Johnston asked for a clear defi-
nition of what is meant by appease-
ment and what the Committee plans
for the peace which is to follow this
war.

On the favorable side were Sam

In answer to criticism of the po-
litical science instructor, William
L. Klinkenstein, C42, who is in
charge of the campus organization
drive, declared that by appease-
ment the Committee means any at-
tempt to make terms with Germany,
Italy, or Japan for a peace to be
dictated by Germany on the basis
of Germany as victor so far in this
war. “In other words,” he stated,
“we oppose a dictated or so-called
negotiated peace before the defeat
of the aggressors.”

The question of the peace which
is to follow the war was one which
piqued many campus observers on

tee organizers declared that they
hoped for a just and stable peace
which would provide for fair and
democratic settlement, by peaceful
means, of international disputes.
They admitted, however, that there
was no clear cut opinion as to how
this goal can be obtained.

“It is our intention to provide the
means for student and faculty dis-
cussion of the peace which they
would like to see at the close of this
war.”

Asking for additional member-
ships from students and faculty
members, the Committee requests
that names be sent to the College
