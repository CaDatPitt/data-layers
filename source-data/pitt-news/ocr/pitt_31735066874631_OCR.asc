_ Monday’s meeting oflStudent Congress opened with
three major projeets pending and demanding attention. The
proposed student discount service was sidetracked pending
results of a poll being circulated by SC to determine student
interest. Discussion on revival of a humor magazine wa
staved on“ for the same reason. . 

President Herman then opened the meeting for a dis-
cussion of the political party system proposed by Men’s

Council. Several members thought that a discussion of this :

proposal had no place in Congress at this time. ,

 

Congress Bogs‘
Down In Mire

Of Politics

By JOAN THOMAS
Behind E In il Herman’s

‘shaky gavel, ittook Student

Congress only 25 minutes on
Monday to stagger into a dead-
end discussion.

Congress brought out that
oﬂicial recognition of politi-

j cal parties at Pitt would pose

two major questions concern-
ing women: 1.) Where will
women stand in connection
with recognized political par-
ties? 2.) How would the forth-
coming won1en’s position be integ-
rated with the men’s set-up?
.Any party formally -recognized
six weeks before the elections

’ would be accepted by the elections

board. ,

Joe Banik, independent repre-
sentative, reported that Bo Wilk-
ins, Mens Council president and
representative to Congress,‘ had
instructed him not to read his
copy of the preliminary plans for
political parties.

Dan Levitt and Bob Sedler
supported Wilkins by stating
that “it is not Student Congress’~
place to discuss political par-
ties.” They have not been in-
vited to send official delegates
to MC’s final ‘political party
meeting tonight.

’ Emil Herman’s repeated quests
for floor discussion on SC’s part
in officially recognizing the parties
were shunned by Levitt and Wilk-
ins. Wilkins balked even after the
affirmative outcome of his re-
quested straw vote with indicated
that a thin majority of members
wanted to hear the proposed plans.

Paul Balles, non SC member,
opposed jHerman’s reasoning
by declaring that a discussion
would be a Waste of time in that
the ‘proposed, recognition of ;
political parties does not. affect
Congress or the women who
comprise part of its member-

 

Herman’s stand was that the
political parties should be estab-
lished schoolwide, including Stu-
dent Congress, and that SC’s ideas
should be conveyed to MC.

The 30 minute discussion of
whether or not to discuss politi-
cal parties led to the general,
opinion that Congress had no
right to air MC’s project. So
they didn’t.

Bob Sedler announced the new
BEPOP for theweek to be posted
next Monday. He also revealed
plans for Student Government
day. His projects include an open
SC meeting, introduction of can-

» didates for offices, and a conclud-
ing banquet. It is scheduled for

Mar. 23, a week before student

elections.

The incomplete student discount
poll results are favorable, show-
ing a definite disinterest in only
ﬁve out of 100 ‘students. Student
Congress disapproved S e d 1 e r ’ s
motion to speak of the discount
plan in classroom-s.

The humor magazine poll tabu-
lations will be completed today.

Dean of Women
Airs Views On

Party‘System

By CECY LINCOFF

Dean of Women Helen P.
Rush was interviewed by the
Pitt News during Student Cong-
ress’»meeting last Monday. Her
feelings with regard to political
parties at Pitt are here stated.

Establishment of a party sys-
tem at Pitt would be “an unfor-
tunate thing.” “The party not in
power,” she said “would work to
discredit the party in power.”

In addition, “ Dean Rush said,
“the issues are not that‘ clearly
defined” showing political par-
ties are needed. There is no
question, according, to the Dean
of Women, whether a party
wants or does not want some- “
thing such as a Student Union
or improvement of the cafeteria.
She thinks that these are all
common desires of the entire
student body. , '-

Miss Rush stated that organiza-
tion of political parties is not the
answer to the underground slates
which come up at election time
each spring. “A better system,”
she said “is to educate and help
the student from the freshman
year, such as the new Men’s Con-
ference is doing.” Then, according
to Miss Rush, “they would be free
to change their minds in terms of
new evidence and new facts as
independents.” ' .«

' Asked if she thought that th
proposed party system ‘would
split up the campus, she answer-
ed “yes,” but, “there is room
for all points of view on a cam-
pus such as ours.”

Miss Rush definitely felt that
the students “have to be unified
on election (of representatives) to

. Student Congress.”

She suggested that women, if
the proposed system is approved
for SC, “will perhaps nominate
their delegates to SC themselves
as part of their own elections,
just as they elect their officers.”

“Student Congress should be a
strong group.”

mote relations among students and
secondly to extend relationships
between the students and the
"faculty and administration. Third-

Help Week. Designed by

Y Is Supported by.Frats

Six fraternities recently added a “Help Week” to their

semi-annual pledge program.

Working along with YMCA

ofﬁcers, who proposed the project for the university, one

group
gram in the South Side.

The YMCA, led by president Bud Hodgkin, fostered then

has already had pledges complete an assistance pro-

idea of. Pitt participation in this nationally popularized pro-
gram. Fraternities have been urged to supplement present
“Hell Week” programs with projects of community service
to supply aid and assistance to worthwhile civic agencies.

Hodgkin contacted the Health and Welfare.Federation

D of Allegheny County for nannies of

institutions and group work
agencies which are in need of
outside help. I

Pi Kappa Alpha was the ﬁrst
fraternity to adopt the project
when it sent ten pledges to‘ the
Visiting Nurse Association, locat-
ed in the‘Presbyterian Church at
20th and Sarah Streets. Working
three to four hours each, initiates
built bookshelves, installed bulle-
tin boards, and painted signs.‘

Lambda Chit Alpha, Alpha
Phi Alpha, Theta Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, and Phi Epsilon Pi have
boarded the bandwagon to pro-
mote a community aid" aspect in
the greek program.

“Help Week” was introduced to
frat-s through IF pledge chairman
Don Gart-ner, Bus. Ad. '56, who
received the idea enthusiastically
and is presently serving as co-
ordinator between the Y and IF
council. The‘ program which ha-s
been gaining momentum in col-
leges and universities throughout
the country, will be projected into
the Greek agenda in addition to

  Twelfth Floor Gets NewLook

Remodeling Work
On 0 Women’s Floor

Now Underway
By FAYE HINKES

Soundsof hammering, saw-
ing, and scraping are echoing
through the twelfth ﬂoor these
days, as a result of the new
remodeling p r o c e s s now
underway. °-

To start the ball rolling, Mrs.
Clifford Heinz‘ presented the Uni-
versity with a gift for a refriger-
ator, automatic washer, and dryer
to complete the kitchen, her orig-
inal gift to the women’s ﬂoor.

Another room being redone is
1228, which is used for class din-
ners, banquets, teas, parties, and
other social gatherings. For ‘all
these occasions, the walls and ceil-
ings were covered with decorated
rugs and cloths to hide the unﬁn-
ished sections.

Summer Change

The change started during the
summer months. All the work on
this ﬂoor is being done by the
University’s own carpenters, paint-
ers plasterers, and decorators. No
outside ‘contractors have been
hired to do the construction. «iv

Since-these workers have to ﬁx
lights, paint other buildings of the
University, or work on the con-
struction for new buildings around
the campus, while at the same
they are remodeling the twelfth

floor, the work has been going‘
' very slowly. =

Social Slow-down
Social activities have slowed
down considerably this semester
because of the changes.

The kitchen, where mehtor
groups, committees, class offi-
cers, and the twelfth ﬂoor staff,
cook food from fudge to four
course dinners, is being en-
larged. One of the women’s
washrooms was-taken out, and
an annex to the kitchenwas
added in its place. i

This extension is painted canary

yellow, and modern light fixtures

hang'from the ceiling. One ‘wall
was opened up into a paneless

A window so that the workers in the

kitchen can use the sinks from
both sides of the room. -
Reﬁnished Room,

_Room .1228 is being reﬁnished

with a three-foot wooden dado. ‘

A From the dado to the ceiling the

walls will be covered with cork.

'. The cork is being used so that

thumb tacks can be put into the
walls. In this way, pictures, an-
nquncements, and bulletins can be
hung up easily when needed.
Neutral colors such as brown,
gold, beige, and white will be
painted on the wood so that color-

.ful crepe paper and decorations

can be used for parties. The ceil- ,

0 ing, which_ is painted white, was‘
0: lowered about two feet and a
round arcrway was formed over,

the door to give the room a mod-
ern touch.
Repainted Conference Rooms

The conference rooms where the A
senior mentors meet their fresh-i
man girls, have been repainted a.
soft shade of blue. Book shelves;
have been added in 1232 C1, one

of the conference rooms, to pro-

vide a small library for freshmen 
who seek advice, and, for upper-é

The student lounge in 1209E
has new draperies which were
made and paid for by the twelfth

writers were transferred from
the student office to the lounge.
Various games such as scrabble,
cards, and checkers have also
been provided for student recre-
ation.

The Women’s Association gave
$150 to reﬁnish the student office.
This room is used for meetings
-and the ﬁles of Senior Court, and
Panhellenic Council are also kept
there.

Dean of Women Helen Poole
Rush said, “Now Pitt women will
have lovelier rooms for their ac-
tivities and more activities in more

What yourlg people are doing at General Electric

Young manufacturing
expert pioneers in
automation at

  General Electric

ln 1964, our greatest shortage may be Work-
ing people. This country’s demand for elec-
trical goods will be 100% greater than it
is today. But there will be only 11% more
workmen. How can production per man be
.boosted enough to close the gap?

For one answer, 31-year-old P. H. Alspach,
Manager of Manufacturing Development at
G.E., is exploring automation. A

Automation: Continuous Automatic Production

Automation is a way of manufacturing based
on the continuous-flow concept. Products
will be made, inspected, assembled, tested,
and packaged by a series of integrated ma-
chines in one uninterrupted flow. As industry
evolves, toward greater automation, more
workmen will become skilled machine spe-
cialists or maintenance experts able to con-
trol complete systems.

Phil Alspach and the men under him now
draft layouts for automatic systems, tackle
the engineering problems involved, design,
automation equipment, and even build some.

23,000 college Graduates at G.E.

This is a big and important job. Alspach was
readied for it in a careful, step—by-step pro—
gram of development. Like Alspach, each
of C.E.’s 23,000 college-graduate employees
is given his chance to grow, to ﬁnd the work
he does best, and to realize his full potential.
For General Electric has long believed this:
When fresh young minds are given freedom
to make progress, everybody beneﬁts--the
individual, thecompany, and the country.

-‘\

 

PHIL ALSPACH joined G.E. shortly after
graduation from Tulane (B.S. in M.E.,
’44),- has completed G.E.’s Engineer-
ing Program, Class of 1945, and its
Creative Engineering Course, 1949.

Concern  

Our do-nothing Student Congress held another abor-
tive meeting Monday at which half of the members sat
back and listened to the dissipated’ discussions that wound

up on an interminable tangent-

Opposition, to proposed plans was not controlled, and

procedural protests from the floor remained unstiﬁed; Dis-

sension as to procedures cropped up ‘even after a go‘-ahead
Vote had been passed. ‘ ‘
Most of the members had no conception of what would
be curtailed with the problem of recognition of political
parties. And since enlightenment did not come until late
in the hour, they were unable to make any contributions.
The entire meeting was lost from the standpoint of
organization and understanding. It was‘ not even understood

 whether Men’s Council’s ﬁnal airing of parties tonight is

open to SC members. So they could not act accordingly.

Re—wording\ of the humor magazine poll, after having
been filled out by hundreds of students, was necessary.

The week—old,student discount poll has not yet been
distributed to the engineering, pharmacy, and nursing de-
partments‘. The do-nothing committee had acted accordingly.
So there were no deﬁnite results to be put before Congress
mem.bers. ’ I ‘ I ‘

A probable solution to the meeting’s chaos would have
been a unity of purpose, necessary for efficient and coopera-
tive functioning in any group. There are too many possible
beneﬁts to the school andthe student body that could be
gainedby a” student governing body to: waste an important
hour on d.eadlo‘cked, purposeless discussions.

And since it appears that they have so far missed the
boat" along these lines, the meeting should have been ad-
journed in 20 minutes, after the necessities had been dis-
posed of. ' ’ ' ‘

By Jim Deweese ‘
Several years ago the University of Pittsburgh
had a pet. People used to seek_it out as a ‘source
of pleasure and as a companion for idle hours

during the day. Three .years ago that pet was en-

trusted to the hands of a group who failed to give '

it adequate care and attention. As a consequence
it died, or perhaps lapsed into a state of suspended
animation as do all maltreated
things which cannot standalone.
It was called, simply, “The Pan-
ther.” -

And now a move is being made
to revive the long dormant mag-
azine. As was expected. the pro-
ceeds will be a delicate one in
that every care must be taken
to insure that its collapse will
not reoccur. In this case a re-
lapse would almost certainly prove fatal. L

The reasons for the collapse of the old humor
magazine have been voiced by members of the
student body, faculty, and administration, but they
can be distilled to the crystal of fact which shows
that the magazine was not selling because it was
not ‘giving thefstudent what he wanted.

In its ﬁnal year of publication, the Panther ap-
peared as an abortion of magazine production. The
quality of paper and photographic reproduction
were poor. The quality of stories and jokes were,
in the main, even poorer. The editors were, in
effect, delivering a slap in the face to not only the
student body but also to the entire University.

An All New Magazine
The new «magazine. which is now being pushed
slowly through the political mill of Student Con-
gress would certainly be just that—-—a new maga-
zine. . . - I
Within this University there is a wealth of un-
tapped talent which, needs only the first urgings of
a growing inertia to be un\covered.
V Writers and future business men with talent
would surely gravitate toward a well organized
magazine with a high standard of literary con-

_H‘ome«?of the Free.@

 

   

*9 V " - wt

tent. And that high standard is exactly what the
new magazine must maintain.

An example of one type of story which would
certainly be‘ included is mirrored in the contents of
Manuscripts, Pitt’s once a year publication by the
English Department.

Proﬁles of Pitt students, professors, and various"

aspects of the University itself wouldlalso ﬁnd a

place in this new magazine, a place which such
stories have been denied due to a lack of space in
the Pitt News.

Poor Taste‘ vs. Popularity
The taste of the jokes in the old Panther were

always quesionable to say the least. We need only
glance at the almost universal popularity of such

features as “postscripts” and “The Perfect Squelch”
in the Saturday Evening Post or “Life in these
United States” and “Slips of the Tongue” in the
Readers Digest to realize the advantage of such
humor over the type which the old Panther had
to swallow.’ This proposed group of anecdotes
would not be taken from the Post or’ the Digest
but would be actual incidents which happen dur-
ing the course of a year here at Pitt. Within this
University there are enough humorous happenings
to ﬁll several humor columns in such a magazine
with a couple of smiles l.eft over.

Constructive Reviews Needed

\The magazine would serve as a valuable source
of information on new books published here. Plays
and certain motion pictures might also be reviewed
but "all such reviews would be written with re-
gard to beneﬁts to students and not as a sarcastic
sounding board /for the writer. 3

There can be no doubt that such a magazine.

would not only serve the students but/would also
act as a valuable publicity vehicle for the Univer-
sity itself. College magazines such as the Harvard

Lampoon and the Princeton Tiger have long held ’

honored places in their schools.

And the reincarnation of the Panther would
certainly prove valuable to Pitt as a literary hu-
mor magazine. It could be nothing but the type of

publication which students want and will be proud’

to take home. ' 4

It» seems that the State De-

In addition, much of Russia’s
information comes from open

America does not want to pay

say that thislmove barring free

of an Iron Curtain. But perhaps

mostly sophomores and juniors.
Secondly, let’s look at ‘the fresh-
man team. Most, if not all of
these ﬁne gentlemen, were chosen
by Bob Timmons. We who have
seen them perform have nothing
but praise for their efforts-—a re-

ment. Thirdly, how many of us
who complain have seen and

cheered the team in at least two

games this season?

Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁfst
of a series of four articles on
WQED, Pittsburg'h’s educational
television station.

Across the street from the
Cathedral of Learning near
the campus of the University
of Pittsburgh stands Pitts-
burgh’s educational television
station, WQED. It is one. of SIX
such stations in the United States.
Its conception, birth, growth, and
hopes for the future have all been

aided and encouraged by the com- .

Inunity which it serves.

Pitt has played no small role in
WQED’s development. The build-
ing itself was lent to the station
by the University. However, to
really appreciate the close associ-
ation between Pitt and WQED one
must go back to 1951. ' -

Apply to FCC

In the fall of that year a group

of leading citizens met with the

Mayor of Pittsburgh, David L.-

Lawrence, for the purpose of ap-
plying to the Federal Communica-
tions Commission for one of. the
254 educational TV channels avail-
able across the nation. ‘

Soon thereafter they were
granted channel 13 in Pittsburgh.
A non-proﬁt corporation was set
up to be officially known as the‘
Pittsburgh Educational Televi-
sion Station Corporation. It had
then and still has a board of di-
rectors comprised of the leading
citizens of the community.

To provide capital these‘ people
applied to three educational foun-
dations for funds. Their applica-
tions were favorably received by
the A. W. Mellon, Ford, and Ar-
buckel-Jamison foundations. So
some headway was being made.
The new station at least had
money with which to work.

First Home

However it had no place to call
“home.” Then in 1953 an addi-
tional $50,000 grant from the A. W.
Mellon Educational Fund for the
purpose of organizing a basic staff
permitted the station to .set up
temporary headquarters at 200
Ross St., in downtown Pittsburgh.
This building had just been va-
cated by Jones and Laughlin Steel
Corporation which had moved

‘ their offices to the Gateway Cen-

ter. .
Pitt’s part in WQED’s growth’
now became clear. For, several
years the University had been
trying to acquire the huge, stone
building across the street on
Fifth Ave. which had once been
part of— the Hubbard Estate. In
the summer of 1953 the Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass Company pur-
chased the building A from the
estate and gave it to the Uni-
versity with the suggestion that
it be made available to WQED.
Pitt immediately announced that
it would lend the building to the
station.

Mrs. Dorothy Daniels, who had
virtually been a staff of one pre-
vious to the acquisition of the
building, now made plans to or-
ganize a complete staff. The build-
ing was remodeled from funds’
contributed from the foundations,
and equipment was purchased.

gram over Channel 13. Educational
television in Pittsburgh was now
a reality. a A
By the time WQED went on
the air about 37,000 families in
the Pittsburgh area had con-
tributed to the ‘support of the
station, since the only way such
stations can operate is through
contributions.

Because of a stipulation made
by the FCC, educational stations
must be ﬁnanced by means other
than advertising. Last Fall WQED
held a 52 hour telethon to solicit
support from the community. Only
$84,000 of the $250,000 necessary
to operatelthe station this year
was pledged.’

No Commercials

Industry can support the station
through contributions or sponsor-
ing paid shows on WQED. Under
FCC regulations, they cannot ad-
vertise, butthey must show spon-
sorship, which in the end would
be good public relations for the
companies. .. i

In this way they are giving
the public a show uninterrupted
by commercials while the public
knows" they are presenting the
show through the announced
sponsorship. ‘

According to William S. Tacy,
Pitt professor of speech and di-
rector of television-, “The necessity
of the peoples’ support is obvious.
WQED is part of a ten county
community which is comprised of
650,000 families. -Allthese people
can enjoy WQED and they should
all help to support it.”

A GUIDE FOR THEDAATELESS

With the cost of dating rising higher and higher (seems the

only pleasure that costs thesame these days is Philip Morris),
it is no wonder that so many of us men are turning to discus

throwing. Naturally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to .

ﬂinging cold disci, but who’s got that kind of money? Prices
being what they are, the average man today has a simple choice;
dating or eating. , p '

Unless the average manvhappens to be Finster Sigafoos.

Let me tell you how Finster Sigafoos, a man no smarter, no
richer, than you or I, solved his dating problem. Finster came
to college with the normal ambition of any average man: he
wanted to ﬁnd the prettiest coed on campus and make her his.
He looked long and carefully, and at last he found her — a tall
job named Kretchma Inskip, with hairlikegbeaten gold. 0

He asked -her for a date. She accept-ed. He appeared at her
sororityihouse that night, smiling, eager, -and carrying a bou-
quet of modestly priced ﬂowers. . -

“Now-then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazyvﬂora to a.
pledge, “where are we going tonight?” M T '

Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared several attractive plans for this evening. “How would
you like to go out to the Aggcampus and see the milking
machine?” he asked. - ~

“Ick,” she replied. ‘ »

“Well then, how about running over. to- the dental school to
fool with the drills ?” .

“Bah,” she replied. .

“Well, what would you like to 'do?”. he asked.

“Come,” said she, “to a funny’ little place I know just outside
of town.” ' S ' A

And away they went.

The place was Millionaires" Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was ﬁlled with- beautiful ladies in backlcss‘
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Waiters scurried about hear-
ing costly eats on ﬂaming swords. Original Rembrandts adorned

the walls. Philip Morris. trays. adorned the cigarette -gii:,ls._, . - T-

L Chained to each table was a gypsy violinist. —

Finster and Kretchma were seated. ‘.‘I',’’ said Kretchmaito the
waiter, “will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I w"5i.~ll7 have

lobster and capon in madeira sauce‘ with asparagus spears. For

dessert I will have loads of out-of-season fruit.”
‘ “And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.

“Just bring me a pack of Philip Morris,” replied Finster,

“for if ever "a man needed the soothing, steadying, ‘beneficent

, aromas of mild. vintage tobaccos, it is me” now.” . _

So, smoking the best of all possible. cigarettes, Fginsteif watched

Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her

fetching young adam’s apple rose and fell, he was out another
97¢. Then he took her home.‘ V‘

It was while saying‘ goodnight that Finster got his bi'illia'nt
idea. “Listen!” he cried excitedly. ‘‘I just had a wonderful notion.
Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!”

By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her house mother and stormed into the house.

Pavlick Tops with 28

With Coach Marc Gu1ey’s cagers employing an all-
court press,‘the Syracuse Orangemen swept over the Panthers

at the Field House last night

by a 91-85 score.

According to Panther Coach Bob.Timmons it was the
unexpected press defense that stumped the Panthers. The
press threw the slower Panthers off balance and they" were
never quite able to solve it completely although at one point

late in the second half they did?

pull to within one point at 61-60.
Guley, who also started his
second-string shock troops as a
second surprise, explained this
move by saying, “I wanted to
see how Pitt reacted to a press.
A After my boys saw what they
did against it,.I sent them in.”
. And, as he also admitted after
the game, “It was a gamble and
it paid o£f.”» ,

Tough Task

Pitt’s once conquered but still
dangerous swimmers will try for
their ﬁrst win of the young season
at the expense of the powerful
Kaydets from Virginia Military
Institute at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Clubsaturday, Jan. 15. _
VMI won the Southern Confer-
ence Championship last season by
scoring an unprecedented 143
points, capturing ﬁrst place in
every event. With several mem-
bers of this championship squad
returning, they again have a
strong team as evidenced by their
61-23 swamping of William and
Mary in their first meet this sea-
son. '

Coach Ben Grady thinks that
the tankers should make a much
better showing against the Kay-
dets than they did against Col-
gate. “The additional month of
practice since the last meet should
help us immensely,” he added.

Overlooked in the last meet was
the ﬁne performance turned in by

stroker from S-chenley. Monsein

Nineteen points each by Phil Klieman and Julius Pegues,

eleven by Chuck Hursh and tene

by Freddy Yee, were enough» to
give the Cubs their eighth victory
in as many games in a contest in

doubt. The Skibo Juniors never
held the lead.

The same Tech squad that gave
the Pittites their toughest ﬁght
previously, a 71-64 tussle in the

night. Joe Tuoci, who led the
Tartan Frosh to their near upset
earlier this season with 23 points,
was held scoreless by Yee in last
night’s contest. ’ '
Kleiman, giving his best per-
formance to date, scored his points
on lay-ups from the pivot and

hit for twelve in the ﬁrst half and

had nineteen mid-way through the
second period when he fouled‘ out.
Pegues was hitting on sets and
jumps from the outside.

Monday night in the Gardens
the Frosh received their biggest
scare of the se.a“son against the
Duquesne freshmen. The Pittites
trailed by as many as ten points
but finally battled to win by a
63-:5-5 score. Chuck I-Iursh led the

Chemical Engineering from Columbia University
in 1952, doing his graduate research work on the
problem of heat transfer in liquid metals. Since

University of Illinois. Last summer he worked in the Technical Laboratory at
Du Pont’s Chambers Works to gain industrial experience. He has not yet
selected a permanent employer, however; and right now he’s asking the kind
of questions which will help him select the right job and plan a successful career.

Sheldon Isakoﬁ‘ answers:

 

An advanced degree would undoubtedly have a favorable effect
in technical work, Bill, but let me enlarge on that just a little.
Inimy own ﬁe1d—-chemica1engineering—a doctorate is consid-
ered to be evidence of demonstrated ability in carrying out
original research. An advanced technical degree is therefore
helpful in obtaining work in research and development, where
that skill is deﬁnitely ir'np‘ortant,. You might say it gives a man

a head start in proving his ability in those areas.

Are you interested in research work?

It’s less important in some other areas, though. For. example, '

in production or sales work a. manifest ability for handling
human relationships is just as important for advancement as ,
ixechnical competence. If an engineer is sold on production work
or sales, a graduate degree in marketing or business adminis-
tration might be more helpful to him than advanced technical
training--in getting started‘.

But I’ve noticed this at Du Pont. Once a man lands a job it.
his chosen ﬁeld and actually begins to work, his subsequent
. advancement depends more on demonstrated ability than on
college degrees. That’s true throughout the entire company--

in scientiﬁc work, administration, or what not.

So an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything at
Du Pont, Bill. But when coupled with proved abilities, an ad-
vanced technical degree is unquestionably helpful to a man in
research-and development work. It often gives him a chance to .

' demonstrate his abilities more rapidly. S ' -

     

_ with the Blue and Gold in the¢

* By GENE AROMATORIO

It’s never a good policy to berate the oﬁicials
of any sport and anyone who has ever been con-
nected with basketball knows that referees have
an especially tough job. They’re not expected to
turn in a perfect job.

But when a referee calls a foul on a player
and then forgets which player it was, it’s about
time to start drawing the line. That’s exactly what
happened Saturday night at the-Field House and it
was directly responsible for the Panther loss.

For those of you who weren’t there, Bob Tim-
mons and his ﬂoormen came out on the short end
of a 73-71 overtime score. Notice that we didn’t
say lost«73-71, but instead, came out on the short
end. And the short end it was too, with the referees
seeing to that.

Now, to the street corner expert, that might
sound like sour grapes. These experts would prob-
ably agree that, “Aw, he’s just trying to cover up
for Pitt.” We can assure you, however, that this
is not the case.

The situation that brought this about Saturday

‘night came when, at the end. of C the regulation

game the score was knotted at 64-64. Then, early
in the ﬁve minute overtime period, Pitt’s‘Ed Pav-
lick was fouled. “Number 79,” the ref yelled.
Number 79 was big Jim Riley — theman who
had been keeping the Titans in the game all night.
This foul was the fourth for Riley so it wouldn’t

have put him out of the.game—-not yet anyway.
But instead of Riley raising his hand to indi- .

cate the foul was on him, Titan Harold Davis raised
a hand. Right then a technical foul should have
been called since the rule book states that when
a foul is committed and a player other than the

‘one committing the foul raises his hand, a techni-

cal foul is to be called on that player. But the
refs were either sleeping or ‘didn’t know this.
Anyway, when Davis raised his hand, this im-

Solid Mat WiniOver Spartans ,
Raises Hopes for Lehigh Tilt

Following their resounding 24-5 triumph over the Michi-
gan State Spartans, Coach Rex Peery’s matmen are adjust-
ing their sights for the annual contest with Lehigh this Sat-
urday. The Panther mat mentor was highly elated over the

performance of his squad in East Lansing, but heefeels there

is still much room for improvement.

The Engineers from Bethlehem are considered on a par

mediately brought up the question at the scorer’sg
table as to who the foul was on. So, referee Pete}
Gallo indicated Davis, who was‘ standing with his;
arm still raised. Davis was number 65. . 

At this, the Panther team, Timmons, and 'the5
spectators went wild. The usually quiet Pavlicki
was after the ref in true Leo Durocher fashion. 1

This caused the refs to go into a hurried con-
ference and come out with a remarkable decision._

The foul wasn’t on Davis, they decided. It wasn’t": ,

on Riley either. Instead it was on number 73—
Tom Schrecengost.“ And no amount of argument
was going to change their minds. They had already
changed twice.

About one minute later, though, Riley was
called for shoving. This would have been the big
boy’s' ﬁfth personal and would have put him out
of the game. Instead, it was only his fourth. Con-
trary to what many fans believe, a player is not
allowedan extra personal because of an overtime.

Then," with' ﬁve seconds remaining and the score
tied at 71-71, a guy by the name of Jim Riley was
fouled under the basket. The tall Titan walked,
up to the foul line and promptly dumped in both
free throws to post the 73-71 score.

Thus, if Gallo ha-d known whom he had called
the foul on, Riley would have been out and would
never have been there to score those winning points.’
Without Riley, the Titans wouldprobably have been
ducksoup for the Panthers.

Even if the Titans could have gone on to win
without Riley, ‘the fact remains that the refs pull-
ed an inexcusable skull. As Timmons said after the
game, “We’re paying the oﬂicials enough to at
least know who they called the foul on.”

For those of you interested in becoming basket-
ball referees, the job pays a neat $27.50 per college
game. All you need is a pair of basketball shoes
and a whistle. Make sure the whistle is loud,
though. And be sure to use it often.

Bill Hulings, decisioned by Bob

Both of the locals’ falls were

over Norm Gill, 9-5, in the 157-

In the second half, however, the
Lambs outscored their rivals 38-

a total of nine during the entire
contest. V ‘

Although rebounding was the
feature attraction of the second
