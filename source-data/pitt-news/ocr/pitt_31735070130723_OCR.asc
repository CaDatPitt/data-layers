for online music

KATIE BOMBICO

Staff Writer

The battle for free music trading
on the Internet ended on Tuesday,
when the mp3 giant Napster agreed to
begin charging its 38 million cus-
tomers membership fees.

This change of action stems from
pressure applied by five major record
companies — Time Warner, Sony,
Universal Music Group, EMI, and
BMG — who are "currently suing
Napster for helping in copyright

 infringement. Bycharging a member-
ship fee to its users, Napster will be .

able to distribute royalties to the
record companies and become a
viable business, by obtaining profits._

The agreement was reached
between Napster and Bertelsmann, a
huge media corporation that owns
BMG. In return for funding N apster’s
reconstruction, the media corporation

will drop its suit against .-the site.

- Bertelsmann has also received the

option to buy a stake in Napster.

The new plan includes a compro-
mise from both sides: Napster will
pay . _record companies and
Bertelsmann will admit ,it’s unwise to
fight the mp3 giant.

Napster started in 1999 by an 18- I
year-old college student who wanted '

to share music files between vmany
users. Many artists and record compa-
nies did not approve since they do not
receive compensation. \

By agreeing to the new course of
action, Bertelsmann hopes to encour-
age other free music trading sites to
adopt a similar plan.

“This is a call for the industry to _

wake up,” said Thomas Middelhoff,
chairman and chief executive of
Bertelsmann.

Board of Trustees elects five new members

KATIE BOMBICO

Staff Writer

Chancellor.Mark Nordenberg told the
ﬁlled ballroom in the .William Pitt Union
last Friday afternoon, that he wants to reach
the highest possible level.

Nordenberg sat facing the square for-

mation of board trustees, addressing the .

progress that the University has made in the
lastﬁve years. A
Noted in the chancellor’s report,

Nordenberg explained to the trustees and 9

others in attendance the ‘increase in com-
posite scores, research funding, private
fimd-raising and endowments to the
University in the ﬁve years that Nordenberg
has been chancellor.

The report of the chancellor opened up
the fall meeting of the Board of Trustees for
the University. .

“As we continue moving toward our
goals, the momentum keeps growing,”
Nordenberg said. . .

Telling success stories of the
University, Nordenberg launched into his
own story of success which began ﬁve

years ago at the 1995 fall meeting of the
Board of Tnistees. He recalled when he
came before the board and was established
as the new chancellor, replacing Dr. Jay
Dennis O’Connor.

The excitement of the plarmed activi-
ties for the past weekend, the Capital

. Campaign, was expressed during the report.

. “We” wouldn’t have much of a week-
end if we didnft have something to cele-
brate,” the chancellor said.

Nordenberg brieﬂy discussed three

press releases that were distributed that day.
These included the second major gift from
the PNC Foundation for the University’s
Katz Graduate School of Business. The
$1.5 million donation will be used to estab-
lish the Thomas H. O’Brien chair in busi-
ness administration.
‘ The Hillman Foundation has granted
$2.5 million to establish an endowed chair
for ﬂie University librarian and ﬂie director
of the University Library System

The ﬁnal press release discussed the
$1.5 million gift received from Herbert W.
and Grace Boyer. This money will be used
to establish an endowed chair in the depart-
ment of biological sciences.

Concluding the report of the chancel-
lor, Nordenberg highlighted the impressive
career of Herbert Boyer, in hopes of admit-
ting him to ﬂie board later in the meeting.

The report of the Institutional
Advancement Committee followed the

Chancellor’s report. Suzanne Broadhurst"

brieﬂy addressed the trustees and then intro-
duced and old ﬁiend, Mr. Rip Van Winkle.
With two full‘ uniformed Pitt band

- members -who trumpeted him in, Van

Winkle took the podium before the trustees
and proceeded into a Power Point presenta-
tion illustrating the University’s latest
achievements. I
The achievements included an increase
in trustee, fimd-raising, alumni and corpo-
ration contributions, as well as individual
giving and contributions from other groups.
A signiﬁcant increase was shown in all
areas. _
Telling the audience to “think big,” Van
Winkle also relayed an increase of 210%" in
Alumni Association-sponsored scholar-

ships. F

Broadhurst then discussed the
Discovery Weekend, for which 1553 alurn—
ni from 27, states were registered to attend

as well as four alumni from the class of
1924. .

Broadhurst praised all the departments
in the University for coming together to
host such an extravagant weekend.

“The University of Pittsburgh is one
great place,” Broadhurst said. —

The meeting moved on to the ﬁve
nominees for the Board of Trustees at the
University. Four of the nominees, Steven C.
Beering, William R. Johnson, George L.
Miles Jr., and The Honorable Dick
Thomburgh, were elected as term trustees

A from 2000-2004. One nominee, Herbert W.

Boyer, was elected as a special trustee until

2002.

Last. on the agenda for the meeting was
areport on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center, which will be the most powerful
computer in the world when completed.
The construction of the supercomputer
began this month and its expected comple-
tion date is October 2001. When it is fully
built, it will ﬁll up an entire basketball court.

“The main goal is to advance science
and engineering research through the use of
the Supercomputing system,” said Ralph
Roskies, the co-scientiﬁc director.

What do you think?

The Pitt News asked students whether they thought that Napster.com, the Web
site allowing Internet users to download music for free, infringes on artists’
rights.

Graham Gullo “I think it’s all bullshit
because all those [musicians] made
their come—up on mix tapes; and that’s
what it’s all about: free music. If you’re
going to look about infringement, look
at the record companies. That’s who’s
really ripping them off.”

Eddie Huang “It infringes on [the
musicians’] rights, but I don’t care,
because I want the music.”

Lauren Torpey “I love it. What’s the
difference between Napster and making
copies of CDs? It’s just a high-tech way
to do it.”

Yomi Ogunmoyela “I like it, but I’m
sure that if I made an album I’d be
angry because people would get it off
Napster and put it on CD. I don’t think
it’s fair.”

Nev Hira “After watching CNN, I truly
believe that Napster is playing a good
role because music sales have risen 3
percent in 1999, which proves that
Napster is not hurting that music indus-
try.” '

Game show attracts campus ‘squares’

“The main Hollywood Squares guy’

was a little intimidating at first but funny.
They were a fun group,” she said.

The object of the TV game show is
identical to tic-tac—toe. The contestants

schools from

sented in the I

tournament. The Hollywood Squares
recruiting team will pick one student
from each school. _

student will betreated to a catered event
with the _.Hollywood Squares celebrities
including Goldberg, =-Caroline Rhea and
host Tom Bergerson.

After explaining the perks of being a
contestant, the Hollywood Squares
recruiters got down to the business of
ﬁguring out who has the personality and
trivia knowledge to be
a successful contes-
tant.

First, the
recruiters handed out
the quiz. On it were
random facts which

true or false. The
statements were along
the lines of “Is t1iple-
double a basketball
tenn?”_,
“I Comerchero
. whizzed through the
questions.

“It was made
up of the dumbest
facts and the sad thing

is, I knew most of them,” she said.

i The recruiters then played a taped
episode of Hollywood Squares for the
warma-be contestants while they waited
for the results of the quizzes.

realized she wasn’t one of the fifteen that

needed to be marked»

had to leave.

After photographing the remaining
contestants, the recruiters next tested the
contestants’ abilities with a mock game
Hollywood Squares officials looked for
enthusiasm, facial expressions and posi-
tivity.

“They aren’t looking to hear your
life story, they are looking for people to
play the game,” Comerchero said.

While Comerchero knew all the
answers in the mock game, she said she
is not very optimistic about getting a call
to be a contestant in December.

“I’m not gonna hold my breath. I
tend to talk really fast,” she said.

But she doesn’t think her perfor-
mance was the worst.

“You could tell who would be elim-
inated by some things that they said,”
she said. “Like some guy who said corny
jokes the whole time.”

The notes taken on the contestants,
along with their photographs, will be
sent to the Hollywood Squares ofﬁce in
California.

Calls will be made during December
to let the contestants know who was
selected for the tournament and who will
be put in a contestant ﬁle.

In the meantime, Comerchero will
keep watching her game shows.

“I love game shows,” she said. “I am
such a dork.”

will be paintings reﬂective of this genre of music
as well as historical artifacts of jazz.

On the police beat
with a Pitt officer

TATIANA ZADONY
Staff Writer

John Boulobasis’ life was saved
as a result of the calmness and
efforts of one man—- Bob Kolesky.
Boulobasis was inspecting manhole
10 on campus when he slipped and
fell 15 feet down the hole, landing
flat on his back. Boulobasis knew
he was hurt and radioed in for help.

Kolesky, better known as
Officer Bob, was the first to
respond to’ Bou1obasis’s call for
help on Jul. 6, 1992. He adminis-
tered first aid and tried to keep the
man calm. Two city medics arrived
on the scene and . they tied
Boulobasis —— now the chief operat-
ing cngincer at Pitt — to’ a back-
board to be pulled up.

“You get three people down
there with all the equipment — you

. get real close,’’ chuckled Kolesky.

Boulobasis fractured three discs
in his lower back. He wrote a letter
to the Pitt police, thanking Kolesky
for his generous-efforts and his
complete control during the situa-
tion. According to Boulobasis,
Kolesky‘ is a tremendous asset to
the police force and a great friend. .

Kolesky fights the stereotypi-
cal, power-happy police officer
image seen on the TV screen daily.
Kolesky has felt compelled to help
people in trouble since he was 13
years old. ,

Born in 1939, Kolesky learned
by following his father’s example.
In 1953, Kolesky was made a junior
fireman after he and his friends
helped build the Glendale fire
building, where his father was fire
chief. Over the course of his life,
Kolesky took on more and more
jobs helping people, acting as a vol-

unteer firefightcr, emergency med-
ical technician, police officer, CPR

instructor and a no—chargc handy-
man for the elderly.

“I try to help people out where I
can,” Kolesky said. '

Kolesky - tries to instill this
value in his family. Married to Fran
for 33 years, Kolesky has two sons,
Jimmy and Gary, both members of
the Oakdale and Glendale fire

departments. There have been three
generations of Koleskys fighting
fires in the Glendale area. Of
course, Kolesky and Fran have
three dogs — all Dalmatians.

He joined the Pitt police force
in 1964 after a friend said Pitt was
looking for good men — men like
Kolesky. - '

A veteran on the force, "he is
currently on the day-shift Cathedral

ofiLearning beat and never has a.

typical day. Hereturns calls for
help with elevator entrapments to
armed robbery. The only thing typi-

cal is that he is constantly helping I

someone, somewhere.

“You lock your keys in your car
and I help’ you,” Kolesky said. “I
tell you, p‘Iiook ‘you owe me a favor.
Next time you see someone in trou-
ble, help them out.”’

Kolesky has seen his share of

catastrophic events. The worst day

on campus for him was when
Langley Hall exploded in 1976
after a natural gas leak.’ Students

were thrown down the hall, and a

tape recording of a lecture caught
the boom and the screams of stu-
dents. Kolesky himself transported
50 to 60 students to the hospital.

Kolesky tries not ,to let those
bad days get to him. He tries to
remember that there are non-con-
frontational ways to’ handle things,
and that a smile is contagious.

Kolesky does not believe every
offense is a crime worth citation.
Kolesky uses what he calls the
‘police discretion. rule,” handling
each situation to the best of his
ability. Unless the person is causing
harm to himself or others, Kolesky
follows his instinct when issuing
citations. '

Last year, Kolesky found a girl _

sleeping .off her graduation party on
the steps of Heinz Chapel.

“Some would say, ‘I’ve got you,
you’re paying,” Kolesky said.

V He said some people forget
ev'eryone’s human. Kolesky just
called a patrol car and sent her
home.

“She was sober enough to take
care of herself, she just had a
headache,” he said. “Why arrest
her?” '

Navigating Oakland on two wheels

RICK NEFF
The Pitt News

Riding a bicycle can often be the
quickest way to get to class or work.
There are more than 30 designated
parking places for bikes on campus,
making it an attractive from of
transportation.

However, as two recent biking
accidents involving Pitt students
have shown that riding a bike in a
busy urban street can be dangerous.

According to the National
Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, each year approxi-
mately 800 Americans are killed and
65,000 are injured in bicycle acci-
dents involving motor vehicles.

Officer Carroll Phillips of the
Pitt police has been a member of the
department’s “bike unit” for 11
months. Part of her required training
included a 32-hour safety course on
bicycle riding in urban settings like
Oakland-.

“Riding a bike is a, lot more
complex than it seems,” Phillips
said. “While many people can ride,
not everybody rides safely.”

Phillips explained that the best
move students can make is to wear a
helmet each time they ride. “I rarely
see students wearing helmets,” she

‘ said.

gnance prohibiting bicycles

The NHTSA enforces that state-
ment by reporting that wearing a
properly fitted helmet reduces head
injuries by 85 percent. If head
injuries do occur in an accident, rid-
ers are 20 times more likely to die if
they were not wearing a helmet.

In Pennsylvania a bicycle is
considered to be a "motor vehicle.

Phillips said, “Bicyc1ists must
specifically obey all motor vehicle
regulations.” ‘

This means that when on a bike,
students must heedeall stop signs
and traffic lights. Phillips reminds
students that they must also use

hand signals to indicate when they

are turning.

“Bus lanes are only for busses
and emergency vehicles. Riding in a
bus lane is definitely a no-no, you
can be cited for that,” Phillips said.
She also confirmed that it is against
the law to ride the wrong way down
a one way street.

Some students may wish to
avoid the traffic in the streets by
riding on sidewalks. But they should
be aware that there is a city ordi-
and
skateboards on sidewalks in
Oakland because of its heavy pedes-
trian traffic.

Phillips offers several tips for
students to help them ride safely
through the busy streets surrounding

Pit .

“Wear bright—colored and reﬂec-
tive clothing while riding to make
yourself more visible to traffic,” she
said. “Be safe, and always assume
that cars can’t see you. Try to make
eye contact with drivers at intersec-
tions.”

Phillips said that bikers should

divide lanes into thirds when riding: -

the left third for left—hand turns, the
right third for right-hand turns. She
also reminded riders to always use

announced at a press conference Tuesday in New York,

Middelhoff embraced each other. This shocked many,
bearing in mind the hostilities in the past months.

It is still unknown how the new plan is going to work.
Many details are unclear, such as how the revenue will be
shared, when the fee will be enacted, and whether Napster
use will continue if users are forced to pay. _

The membership fee is another detailin question. A
monthly fee of $4.95 has been proposed, but no definite

number has been established.

Several other mp3 sites continue to allow free trading
of music files. It is unknown if users will jump from
Napster and onto a different free provider. _

“Without a doubt, I definitely will be changing from
Napster,” said Mike Coupland, a sophomore majoring in

pre-education and theatre arts.

Coupland is not alone in his decision. Junior Alex
Katzman, majoring in information sciences, fits the
stereotype of the poor college student who doesn’t want to

relinquish $5.

“I don’t want to pay $5,” Katzman said. “If they start
charging, I’ll probably use a different program.”

Some students will pay the minor fee to reap the ben-
efits of Napster. Jessica Nemeth has been using Napster
for 1 1/2 years and enjoys the program enough to pay for

It.

“I don’t think they should be charging but it’s not out-
rageous,” Nemeth said. “$5 is a lot cheaper than buying

CDs all the time.”

Protest at Chancellor’s home

What the Coalition needs to

After all, Pitt cannot change

tions.

Though the law prohibiting

V-any state—funded university

from offering same-sex benefits
i_s wrong, it still is the law and
it still prohibits Pitt from grant-
ing same-sex ‘benefits.

Pitt receives a significant
portion of its funding from the

state and, as such, the adminis- V
_tration’s hands are tiedvon the

issue} .
Ideally, the ‘University
al. other employers in'the area
and several other universities
do and offer same-sex benefits
for it_s -employees. However,

being a state-related institution,

Pitt cannottake the stepunilat-
erally, and Pitt risks way too
much ‘in lobbying for the law to
change. V _

' Because , of this, ' the
Coalition needs to focus its

. energies on changing state law

and not trying to get the admin-
istration to do something that it
cannot do.

Only by networking with
activists at other schools and
lobbying the state will the
Coalition be able to make any
change occur. This is the only
way‘ that Pitt will finally be
able to do the right thing and
offer same-sex benefits to its
employees.’ ' '

T oteliberal ito vote Democrat

Being a liberal in America has always been
somewhat of a There have been times in our

nation’s history when the word “liberal” was .
practically a dirty word and its application denot- ‘.
ed one as a hippie, communist or worse. _, , i -
‘ Now, however, it seems that the-_mV0r6V, ﬁe- '
quent accusation leveled against   that .

they are not being liberal enough. I’ consider
myselfto be a liberal, and I am also aDemocrat.
Yet as Election Day approaches, being a
Democrat and a supporter of America’s tradition-
ally liberal party isn’t good enough for some peo-
ple. There are those that would have you believe
that, unless you move to the extreme
and willingly give your vote to a
manthathasnochanceatvictory,
you’re not really a liberal.
Itiseasytolurepeopleinwith _—
the notion of a “moral victory” —  ‘

V the thought that, even though a political party is

bound to lose, its supporters are still in some way
superior to their opponents in principle. V

This is romanticism at its ﬁnest — what a
heroic sacriﬁce your little vote can make. This
fails to take into account that, while clinging to
principle, the voters who go out on a limb and
“vote their conscience” deliver their nation into
the hands of the political party antithetical to their
beliefs.

This means your vote isn’t a sacriﬁce, and it
isn’t a waste —- it is a tool for the opposition. That
doesn’t seem like much of a moral victory to me.

So though I am being increasingly ordered to
further ‘ 'beralize” myself and join in the support
of a statement-making lost cause as it goes down
in a liberal blaze of glory this Nov. 7th, it’s easy
for me to stand ﬁrmly in my support of die
Democratic Party. V ' -

Iarnwillingtoconcedethatmyown
of liberalism does not always completely coin-

A cide with the Democratic National Platform. I am

opposed to the death penalty, but the Democratic
Party is not Likewise, I am in favor of irnrnedi—
ate national health insurance, whereas my party
has approached this subject with tirnidity. I am
also in favor of much stricter handgun laws than
the Democratic party is willing to propose.
Despite these ideological diﬂ’erences, how-

  

ever, I  still proud to be a registered Democrat,
andmy support of the party and its candidates is
unwavering. So how do I reconcile the differ-
ences between my personal beliefs and the beliefs
of my party?

It’s easy .——- being liberal does not mean that
I am not a pragmatist as well. As a liberal, I want

to live under a left—leaning government. So,»

which left-leaning party has the capability to get
elected to the highest national oﬂice? The
Democrats.

Which left-leaning party has the national

respect and recognition necessary to garner pub- ‘

lic support? The Democrats.

Which left-leaning party has

V . candidates qualiﬁed and experi-

_ : V enced enough to lead this nation?

“ . The Democrats.

‘ " So even though I may not
always agree with every stance my party takes, I
am not a hypocrite to support them. Being a lib-
eral and voting for the Democrats isn’t hypocrisy
— it’s common sense.

The Democratic party closely, if not precise-
ly, minors my liberal beliefs; and they are the
only party that gives me the chance, through my
support, to put my political beliefs to work in gov-
ernment ofﬁce. T

So don’t look for me to go down as an elec-
toral martyr on Nov. 7. When I cast my liberal
vote, it will be for the party that most closely
matches my ideology and has the only real
chance to make a difference in this nation.
Despite what others will tell you, voting for the
party with the only real oppor111nity to effect pos-
itive liberal change in America certainly consti-

V tutes “voting your conscience.”

So to my fellow liberals I say, “Everyone
respectsamartyr,butintheend,thatmartyris still
dead” Vote forthe liberal party that can win this
election: Vote for the Democrats.

BecauseI’msureeveryliberalcanagreethat
the alternative to a Democratic victory is too hor-
rible to contemplate.

Sabrina Spiher would like to remind everyone
that when you go Green, you ’re only nurturing a
shrub.

Paul Rhoads has faced some
tough challenges as Pitt’s defensive
coordinator over the past four
games. His defense has faced some
of the best multi—faceted and strong-
armed quarterbacks in the nation.

From Syracuse’s Troy Nunes
and Virginia Tech’s Michael Vick, to
Boston College’s Tim Hasselbeck
and Rutgers’_Mike McMahon, each
have presented various problems to

the fiery defensive tactician.

This weekend won’t be any dif-
ferent when quarterback Ronald
Curry and the Tar Heels‘ (3-5 over-
all, 1-5 Atlantic Coast Conference)
roll into Three Rivers Stadium on
Saturday to take on the Panthers (5-
2, 2-2 Big East Conference).

“He is every bit the athlete we
have seen at quarterback, he’s the
kind of guy that will make you miss
and then go down field another 20
yards,” Rhoads said. “He’s strong
and if you don’t wrap him up, he’ll
leave you hanging like [Vick] did
when we had two guys wrapped

around his ankles and threw the ball
into the stands.”

Curry is a student of the new
school of quarterbacks taking over
in football that can throw and run.
His 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound frame
and swift speed makes him a dan-

gerous threat under center. He’s
thrown for 1901 yards and nine
touchdowns on 125-of—232
attempts.

Curry’s been picked off eight
times this year, but he can easily
scramble for extra yardage. He’s ran

   

for 408 yards, but the weak North
Carolina offensive line has allowed
him to be sacked for a. loss of 240
yards throughout the season giving
him only a deceiving total of 168
rushing yards.

“Ronald Curry was a major part
of them defeating us a few years
ago,” head coach Walt Harris said.’
“He has the ability to make plays.”

The Pitt defense is ranked 35th l

nationally in total defense, 27th in
rushing defense,’ and 22nd in scor-
ing defense. The rankings are
impressive, but Rhoads is not happy
with the performances lately. At one
time they were ranked eighth in the
nation against the run and last week

gave up 283 yards on the ground to

Virginia Tech.

“We did not tackle well at all at
Virginia Tech, we missed way too
many tackles as a defense,” Rhoads
said. “We have to stop the run every
week and force them to pass when
they don’t necessarily want to pass.”

dangerous ability to strike from the

In a massive Carolina quarter-

Becme the ‘fanof the year’ this weekend

It is ‘November, people, and that
is generally bad news for me. The
air gets a little colder, and the wind
gets a little stronger.

Fortunately, the start of basket-
ball season gives sports fans a
chance to be optimistic. 3.

With the football team doing
well, on the verge of clinching a
bowl game with its sixth victory,
and the men’s soccer team playing
in Big East quarterfinal action at

A home on Sunday, basketball could-

n’t have come at a more inoppor-
tune time.

Please don’t say that I am a
naysayer, and I don’t like the bas-
ketball teams, because both teams
should have a good shot at postsea-
son tournaments, but there’s only so
much time to devote to being a fan.

If you were a fan of both the
football and men’s soccer team, and
both the men’s and women’s basket-

, ball teams, you would either be in

heaven or hell, depending on how
you look at it this weekend. _ »

The ‘ football team plays
Saturday at Three Rivers Stadium at
6:30 p.m. against the North
Carolina Tar Heels. The women’s
basketball team opens its exhibition
season tonight against the Premier
All-Stars at 7 p.m.

The men’s basketball team hosts

November Nightmare arrives this
weekend. A
So, I’m challenging you, the

‘ Pitt fans. If you are caught up on

your schoolwork, which I’m sure
you are considering the "studious
nature of every person that attends
this University, then I have a deal
for you.

Eat an early dinner tonight, and
then head up to Trees Pool for the

You can either stay for the
whole meet or leave a bit early to
head across the street to the Field
» House for the women’s
basketball exhibition
game.

At the latest, you’ll get back
’ __ to wherever you live by 9:30
 p.m., which gives you plen-
I; ty of time to sleep, because
vi you’ll need it for tomorrow.

 at 10 a.m. togget a late
' breakfast and head back
up to Allequippa Street.
This time, you even get
the option of going to
Trees Pool or the Field
House first.

Make sure you get to both the
swimming, meet and the volleyball
game, but hang around up there
afterward. It’s probably smart if
you pack a lunch and eat it some-
where on upper campus.

Those two events should be
over around 1 or 1:30 p.m., which
gives you time to tailgate before the
men’s basketball game at 3 ‘p.m.

That game should end at around
5 p.m., which gives you an hour and
a half to get down to the William
Pitt Union, hop on a bus and go to
the football game.

 

men’s swimming meet against After the Panthers’ big win over

the Tar Heels, get some sleep again,
because Sunday is the tricky part.

The men’s soccer playoff game
is at 1 p.m., and there are a few
shuttles leaving from the Union that
will take you to Quaker Valley.

Because of the length of some
soccer games, and the fact that the
shuttles will be leaving immediate-
ly following the conclusion of the
game, it will be tough to make it
back before the end of the volley-
ball game against Rutgers, which
starts at 2 p.m. at the Field House.

I know that you can do it,
though. Making it to all eight home
sporting events this weekend is
tougher than any final you will face
come December.

Show your Pitt pride and get out
to all eight events. If you e—mail me
at bjcst3l after the weekend and are
able to prove you went to all eight
sporting events, you will be inter-
viewed and recognized by me in my
next column as the “Pitt Fan of the
Year.”

It’s an important weekend, and
wouldn’t it be crazy if Pitt won all
eight games?

editor of The Pitt News and is tak-
ing the weekend off in preparation
for his first ﬂight next week to

Quaker Valley to host men’s soccer quarterfinal

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

Pitt’s men’s soccer team will
begin its quest for .a Big East
Championship when it hosts Seton
Hall Sunday at 1 p.m.

The game will be held at Quaker
Valley High School, but Pitt is pro-
viding transportation for students

-.r«/.r/i.-

who wish to attend. .

Two campus shuttles will take.

students to Quaker Valley. Both
buses will leave Pitt from the corner
of Bigelow Boulevard and Fifth
Avenue, on the Cathedral side, at
noon. Space on the buses is first
come, first serve. The shuttles will
leave Quaker Valley immediately
after the game.

The game will be a battle

between the defense—minded Pitt
team and the high-scoring Seton
Hall attack. Seton Hall is 11-6 on the
season, with a 6-5 mark in Big East
play. Pitt finished 13-4 overall, 7-4
in the conference.

The Panthers’ win total is just
one shy of tying their best finish of
all-time. Pitt finished 11th in the Big
East last season. Sunday’s game will
mark Pitt’s first appearance in the

Big East tournament since 1995,
when a second—place finish in the
regular season put the Panthers in
the postseason tournament.

The winner of Sunday’s game
advances to the semifinals of the
tournament, where it will face the
winner of the Syracuse-Connecticut
matchup. The semifinals and finals
will be held at Rutgers University on
Nov. 10 and Nov. 12, respectively.
