WCourse review available Monday -

by BILL PROUDFOOT

A revised and newly reorgan-
ized edition of the Undergraduate
Academic Review will be avail-
able to students Monday, just in
time for the beginning of regis-
tration for the Fall Term.

According to Rudy Potenzone,
co-editor of the Review with Ka-
thy Stackhouse, this year’s eval-
uations will be numerically repre-
sented in percentiles from 1-10,
from poor to excellent.

This type of comparison, said
Potenzone, will allow a more uni-
_form and easily recognizable
ranking than the random com-

‘ ments provided in previous eval-

I

._.r' ’

nations.

“The random comments were-
n‘t accurate and were usually
just a condensation of students re-
action by a few biased evalua-
tors,” said Potenzone.

Each course has been scored by
students on a 1-10 scale, and a
computer averaged the scores
into a final percentile figure, in a
sense “grading” the instructor.

Students can then determine
where instructors rank on a
standerized, graduated scale. Re-
sults are easily comparable, un-
like the old systems whereby the

, student was left to evaluate the
evaluation himself.

An important facet of this year’s
evaluations, said Potenzone, is
that “the use of a standardized
percentile system accurately rep-
resents each tacher, relative to
each other teacher.”

For example an instructonwho

V receives a “four” would compare ,

less favorably with a teacher in
the same course who rates an
"eight." At the same time, a
teacher assigned a “nine“ would
be considered a generally more
competent instructor than one
who rates a “four” or “five."

In addition to his numerical rat-

. ing, the teacher will receive a
"computerized verbalization,“ a
few sentences translating his per-

 ' centile mark. The benefit for the
"3; student, said Potenzone, will be

POTENZONE AND STACKHOUSE: Course evaluation forthcoming.

A survey will be conducted in

worth to students. Following this
evaluation a policy will be devel-

With the music of Joan Baez
playing in the background. several‘
types of arts and crafts, produced
by area women, were on display
Sunday in the SU Ballroom.

Needleworks, painting. sculp-

highlighted the program spon-
sored by the Associated Women’s
Students and the Special Pro-
grams Office.

Sandy George, a Pitt student,
could be seen patiently Crocheting

(clothing, purses, belts) an art-
form.

’ "I think all women's work, such
as sewing and embroidery, was
done as a necessity. It was
thought of that way for so long,
that it lost its artistic value."
she said.

Anything can be used to crochet,
George said, but the most com-

, _“monly_ used materials are wool,

priority to the evaluations.

orlon and jute. Crocheting “is like
anything else women do, it’s over-
looked,” she said.

Ellen Janis, a local shop-owner,
had, on display “tie-dyed ‘art
forms.” She described the meth-
od of tie-dying as “not hard to do,
it’s quick, and if you don’t like
what you have, you can start
again.” — .

Tie-dying originated in the sixth
century in China and India, Janis
said, and has been handed down
within households ever since.
Women wereprimarily in charge
of it, because it was part of their
household duties.

Janis cited some examples of
the arts use. Japanese women
wear a tie-dyed obi (belt) as part
of their normal dress, and the
techniqueis also used for wall-
dividers and screens, she said.

In inEducation II Conference, which

will be held March 3, 4, and 5.

"You would be amazed at the
number of people who haven’t
heard about open classrooms or
the number of teachers who hate
their work because they are en-
slaved by tradition in their own
classrooms,” she said. “We hope
to draw people from all over
Pennsylvania and the surround-
ing states to the conference which
will concern innovative educa-
tion—what is happening and who
is doing it.”

Tratenberg, a senior undergrad-

V uate in the School of, Secondary

Education, said the program will
try to reach as many people as
possible. Last year approximate-
ly 3,000 individuals attended the
conference.

A series of films, demonstra-
tions, classrooms, seminars; pan-
el discussions, workshops, and
displays at the Graduate School of
Public Health Saturday and Sun-
day will highlight the program.
Several local innovative schools
will open their doors to the educa-
tors to show how some of the new
modes of teaching are being put
into practice.

“This year’s Encounter Pro-
gram grew out of the needs ex-

pressed last year,” said Traten-

berg, ‘‘and it will not be as theore-

tical as last year’s conference. «

We plan to offer a practical guide
for changing educational meth-
ods.”

Speakers will include educators

at 7:30 p.m.

Sexism in the schools, urban
education, improvisational edu-
cation and the use of games and

some of the subjects explored in
the seminars and lectures.

The conference is being spon-

sored by the Undergraduate Cabi- .

Pittenger seeks easing
of job reqiiirements

For an editorial on Pittenger’s
proposals, see Page 4.

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN ,

Pennsylvania Secretary of Edu-
cation, John C. Pittenger has an-
nounced his intention of propos-
ing a two.-pronged program aim-
ed “ at those seeking diplomas
from state universities.

Pittenger told a press confer-
ence at Chatham College last
week that both he and Governor
Shapp would introduce legisla-
tion to modify the widespread

demand for degrees which are

not job related.

In stating his opposition to the
idea of a college diploma as a
prerequisite for employment,
Pittenger said he would first di-
rect his attention to his own de-
partment and then focus on en-
forcement mechanisms through-
out the state.

Implicit in Pittenger’s state-
ment on job requirements was
the possible elimination of state
academic examinations like the
civil service test.

Despite his proposal. to de-
emphasize the acquisition of-
college diplomas. Pittenger also
advocated a program which
would aid students interested in

drawings, with emphasis on the
feline family. Included was a se-
ries of identical etchings with dif-
ferent color schemes. In the black
and white version, a cat with its
mouth open and sharp teeth ex-
posed, seemed to be crying for
help. But when orange-and red
coloring was added, the cat sud-
denly seemed to be looking for

prey.

would resemble a correspond- ’

attaining a degree.

Although not a proposal for,

"open admissions." Pittenger‘s

plan calls for initiation. of an  "I

"external degree program."
This system would enable stu-
dents to earn degrees without

being present on-a university

campus.

Unlike. the open admission
policy of the City College‘ of
New York, where every state
citizen is permitted to enroll,
Pittenger’s proposal would oper-
ate on the order of the system

now in effect in the state col-A _

leges of New York. -

Students would do field work,“

internships, or independent study
under the. guidance of an on-

ence course.

According to Warren Ringler,
assistant commissioner of educa-

tion, the “external degrees” pro-

gram would be done on an exper-
imental basis with no coercion

from the ‘state. Individual univer-" ’

sities would have to agree to the
trial program. —

The Pittsburgh Press quoted, 

Pittenger as calling for both
measures to provide

in education.”

I Cathi Ritts, chairwoman of the

planning committee, said of the, 1

workshop:
“We wanted something informal

and free, something people could * 

participate in. Everything so far

in the Women’s Cultural Festival 1

had been -observation, sitting in an
audience.”

“I think everyone enjoyed them-
selves today,” she added. '

“If I got into trouble and I didn't

could I call? There was no one

lottery determines roommates

by EVAN PATTAK
. Associate Editor .

Men and women students at the University of Michigan are
experimentally sharing rooms at an off-campus co-op house.

Seventeen men and 12 women residents of the house. called
Xanadu. drew lots last weekend for roommates for the two-week
trial. I »

Doug Piper. a Xanadu resident. said that the cohabitation exper-
iment is aimed at some of the traditional barriers between the sex-
es. V‘ R, .. V, ‘ ,
“It’s. ridiculous that’ you can’: relate to members of the opposite
“It isn’t a social norm to have real friends of the. opposite sex."
he added. "You relate to them sexually and that’s all."

Piper said that roommates were assigned by chance rather
than by preference to simulate the typical dorm experience. '

“Most kids when they move into 'a dorm‘ situation get stuck,

with each other,” he said, “and that’s the way we wanted it.”

To prevent incompatiblepeople from being thrown together,
however, each participant submitted a confidential list of the few

Thirty—five residents of Xanadu. including Piper. will not parti-H

cipate in the experiment. because of a top-heavy male-_ferr'1ale ratio

or their contentment with existing arrangements.

Piper said that no Zanadu resident objected to the plan on moral
grounds. .

Bob Hughes, Michigan's Associate Director of Housing, said
that Xanadu's experiment would probably violate university policy.
if the house were administered by the school. It is, however. a mem-
ber of the Inter-cooperative Council. a student-owned and student-
operated‘ venture that is university-approved but not under the school’s
jurisdiction. I i l ' ~

Hughes said that a_ meeting between house residents and school
officialsis scheduled for this week. ‘

The experiment has also sparked interest- among the media.
Piper said that since the Detroit Free Press broke the story,»Xanadu

‘has been beseiged by phone calls from reporters. In addition‘, CBS

news filmed a feature on the House.

“Characteristic Features of

Druids axe two (iwitrds

by MARGIE BRENNER

\.

 

 

Members of the Druids, a _men’s honorary fraternity, have voted
to abolish their “Sophomore and Junior Man of the Year” awards.

The annual awards were granted the junior and sophomore offer-

ing “the greatest contribution to the University.”

Druids President Joel Hurwitz views the decision as symbolic
of a change in the organization’s interpretation of its role in the
University.

“Singling out one individual smacked of elitism,” he said. “This
change marks a trend away from this attitude.

“A selection process by which an individual who has made the
greatest contribution to the University is chosen in an exercise in
futility. There is no need to single out the most outstanding individu-
als in University activities.

“Besides,” he added,” participation in University activities
should be a reward in and of itself.” .

The Druids, formed in 1916, have made "Man of the Year"
awards almost since its beginning. Membership in the organiza-
tion is based on an individual’s participation in University ac-
tivities and his grade point average. ‘

Nomination for new members are solicited from active members
and from other campus organizations. Membership currently num-

. bers 52.

A similar motion to abolish the awards was defeated last year.

Harrisburg (_AP)—S‘enate leaders hope to act this week on bills
to reduce penalties for marijuana possession, increase sentences for"
trafficking in drugs, and spur development of treatment programs
for addicts. ' - 

But Rep. Milton Berkes, D—Bucks, who guided more liberal"
reforms through the House last summer, said that Senate amend-*
ments to his legislation were so extensive that a l
tee eventually would have to work out a compromise.

Drug abuse, home rule, workmen’s compensation benefits and‘

changes in legislative procedures are the prime items on the legis-L’
lative agenda as both the House and Senate reconvene, following. a 7

day off for George Washington’s birthday.

\

The two-bill package .on drug and alcohol abuse now before the‘ 5
Senate would reduce the maximum penalty for a first instance ‘of - FF

marijuana possession to 30 days in jail and a $50 fine, in cases where,‘

the amount involved was less than 30 grams—just more than an ounce. '*  *

The crime would be a misdemeanor.

Marijuana possession is currently a felony, carrying maximum 

penalties of five years in jail and a $5,000 fine.

The bills passed the House with only one dissenting vote last ' 
July, with the same 30-day, $500 maximum penalty. But they spe1l—_.I71_-_*‘_

Higher Education
reforms beckon

_- State Secretary of Education John Pittenger is attempting to
' redefine the meaning of the college diploma in Pennsylvania.

 Pittenger is pushing two proposals which, if approved by _the
 State Legislature, will radically alter the role of institutions of high-
” er learning in this commonwealth.

 . In a nutshell, Pittinger seems to believe that no one should
 attend college merely out ofoa sense of obligation and that no one
I 'who'really wants to attend college should be denied that oppor-
7, V tunity;

A‘ These are laudable goals. and one of Pittingers proposals is
likely to further them. The other proposal. however. is ill-conceiv-
;.ed and might actuallyimpede progress toward the society which
Pittenger envisions.

 Under the first proposal. Pennsylvania employers would be
" forbidden from making a college degree a prerequisite'to em-
ployment unless skills acquired in college are actually necessary
for the work to be performed. '

Pittenger will soon implement this practice with his own
jhiring policies, and he hopes the State Legislature will eventu-
- ally pass, a bill applying this procedure to all Pennsylvania em-

ployers, whether public or private.

. If approved, this scheme would probably have a salutary ef-
gfect on employment practices in Pennsylvania. Where a college
education is relevant preparation for a job, employers would be
"free to require a sheepskin. But where a college education makes
no difference, it could not be consideredisine qua non ‘for employment.

In addition, Pittenger‘s proposal would discourage people
.. from getting a college degree unless they perceive an -actual link
A between a college education and their career plans or they are
 imbued with a passionate zest for learning.

 I’ Such a development would be beneficial to all concerned. A
 student who obtains a college diploma under the mistaken impres-
«=__sion that it is necessary for a job is not very likely to learn much
5. or contribute much while at a university.

, Also, already crowded colleges and universities would receive
some relief. -

. Most importantly, Pittenger’s proposal, like the abolition of the
draft, would remove a sword of Damocles which has impelled many
students to go to college simply because they believe they have to.

: In contrast to this exce -nt reform, Pittenger’s other plan
seems ill-suited to accomplish the purpose Pittenger has in mind. 

 This plan, modeled after a system that has been implemented

by the State University of-New York. would enable people to obtain"
 p’ a college degree without physically going to college.
., Called an "external degree" program, such a set up involves
I‘ doing course work at home and keeping ,in touch with a faculty
mentor. —

, Though such a proposal might appeal to those who believe

colleges should “process” people who do well. on multiple-choice
. _' tests, the very idea is repugnant to those who believe the univer-
-  sity must be a community. '

The familiar cycle of study and regurgitation, after all. is only
a part of university life. Interaction among peers and dialogue
__ with faculty members are as important. yet these processes suffer
1 inan-“externaldegree"program. .
, , Pittinger’s goals are commendable. and his proposed revision of
‘ ‘I -‘ employment practices is-a welcome call for reform.
M But Pittenger’s endorsement of the “external degree” concept
I suggests a deplorable acceptance of mass-production in higher edu-
 catioii and a rejection of the premise that higher education must be
 communal in nature. ‘

g. A The Pitt News must wish the Secretary of Education only par-
tial success.

by JERRY WEBSTER

Webster is one of the coordinators of Educa-
tion Encounter II, a weekendlong forum on edu-
cational reform, which begins Friday night at
7:30 p.m. in Carnegie Music Hall. ‘

Very few concepts in education have gained

the momentum that the Open Classroom has gain-
ed in the past years. Once considered a roman-

tic fantasy of liberal intellectuals and the counter-

‘culture. the Open Classroom is today being stud-
ied across the country. This concept has been ac-
cepted to the point of being policy in some pla-
ces. as in North Dakota and Hartford, Connecti-
cut.

In Pittsburgh, the Social Board is training
fachers through a program at the Washington
earning Center in co-operation with the Buhl
Foundation, to teach in open Classrooms in the
city’s elementary schools. Many schools in the

_Pittsburgh area are being pressured by parents

to make their children’s education Open.

It is very possible in the near future that
Pennsylvania schools will be Open. The Gover-

nor has already expressed his interest in the

concept. and more and more school districts are
starting. new Open Classrooms in the coming
year. Unfortunately, the Open Classroom could

easily-go the way of the “Progressive Education" -

of the 1920’s, as many of its critics claim, due
to the misconceptions ‘of both its opponents and
its supporters. People have too readily built a
mythology around a concept that is both psycho-
logically and educationally sound.

S'omehow,,the Open Classroom has been at
once disguised as both a romantic solution to all
the evils, the promiscuity, the drug use and the
nihilism of the Counter-Culture. The Open Class-
room is. however, strongly rooted in Dewey,
Piaget, Ericson, Meade, and the Britishlnfant
Schools, as well as much of the psychological
sociological, and anthropological works of the
past half century. '

In the 20‘s, “Progressive Schools" began to
shoot up, due to the works of John Dewey. Dew-
ey stressed learning through exploration- The
movement soon fell into chaos. however. due to
the failure of its practitioners to direct that ex-
ploration.

Learning by exploration reappeared in Britain

after World War II. During the blitzkreig. child-

ren and their teachers were evacuated to the coun-
tryside. Because of the intimacy of that situation.
the teachers began to reassess and change their
attitudes about the way children learn. Today
more than half the “Infant Schools“ or primary
schools employ the “integrated day". the Brit-
ish equivalent of what we call the “Open Class-
room.“ '

The Open Classroom comes to us via the
success of the British integrated day and the influ-
ence of such sensitive teachers and authors as

  Open Classroom
accents freedom

 

Holt. Kozol. Kohl. Postman. Weingartner. and
many others.

The success of both the British Infant Schools
and the talented teachers in America’s Open
Classroom and Free Schools is due to a great
deal more than ideological commitment to free-
dom.

The freedom from coercion. ‘manipulation
and extreme restraint you find in the Open Class-
room reflects the teachers concept of the way a
child learns and his concerns for the child's emo-
tional as well as cognitive growth. The Open
Class teacher views knowledge as community pro-
pertyand the child as his partner in learning.

The teacher must be able to provide a child
with a structured learning environment. a re-
sponsive environment in which he can mani-
pulate. and through manipulation and exploring.
discover the underlying premises upon which
we build the disciplines.

This kind of teaching demands training in
child development, psychology. and a basic back-
ground in all the. disciplines. An Open Classroom
teacher needs special skill in listening and asking
questions in order to direct each child’s explor-_
ation. The job demands patience. enthusiasm. and
a desire to share. ’

‘Too often, a well meaning teacher mistakes
chaos for openness. The Open Classroom can
often be a" form of abandonment, if a teacher
thinks that by setting up areas and letting the
children wander, he is teaching. The Open
Classroom implies "direction of learning and con-
cern for each child’s growth. A child can learn
many of the treasures of our culture only if they
are shared.’ . A

The crux of the problem is implementation of
the philosophy in practical terms, and implemen-
tation comes best from training and experience.

’It- will be the responsibility of the universities

to provide teachers with the kinds of skills they
need to teach in the Open Schools of the future.
The universities, however. back away. considering
the Open Classroom a fad. even though its foun-
dation is sound.

The Open Classroom doesn't end at the third
grade. Every student should be a partner in his
own education and be guaranteed his own dignity.
If the Open Classroom succeeds. if teachers are
trained to teach by directing. by sharing. and by
respecting the child. the same respect and freedom
will spread into the junior highs. the high schools.
and the institutions of higher learning.

Not only are teachers and pupils partners in
education. but so are parents and the public
at large. ‘It is crucial at this point that the public
beifully aware of the intent and import of the
Open Classroom. The next few years may well
determine the future of’ public education. and we.
the future teachers and parents. will play a key
role.

Language, history awareness missing

China commentaries lack insight

‘by JACK APSCHE

Of all the good that President Nixons
recent China trip might have produced.
one failure is already apparent. This was

, the failuregof the media in general. but
especially the television coverage, to‘pro—
duce any worthwhile, or comprehensive
picture of life in China. '

There appeared to have been an overt
lack of research which coupled with the
language gap of the commentators. Their
attitude was arrogantly ‘American. there- .
fore they looked at China through the
eyes of ill-informed Americans.

They appeared to have entered
China with the attitude typical of The
Ugly American. In fact NBC’s John
Chancellor at times appeared to be bored
with the entire situation.He was one who
complained_ because the Nixon-Chou
meetings were secretive. Their coverage
certainly lacked the skill of a journalist,
and it is in fact a misnomer to call
these commentators journalists.

Looking at the reports received. it
is evident that the vast majority of them -
dealt exclusively with the President, an,‘
his personal entourage. I agree to an ex-
tent that some of this coverage is valid.
but it is unfortunate that they stopped
at that. The remainder of the reporting

_ appeared as unimaginative platitudes_,,as ’ V’

. what to look for.

_China. . g‘ 

to 'how regemented the people were. or
how the streets appeared, or even how
people lived in communes.

I feel that the problem of the televis-
ion commentators stemmed from- the
fact that they were ignorant of the Chi-
nese, their history, language and customs.
Just the ignorance of the language made
it an impossibility to speak to or of
Chinese with any expertise,

There were events that transpired be-
fore them, and due to this inexpertise
they were unable to report events accur-
ately. '

I fail to understand whyithe networks
did not employ and send people to China
who not only spoke the language but were
cognizant of the heritage. I am sure
that in a city of seven million people.
such as Peking. there could have been
many enlightening reports. if one knew

Instead the public was subjected to
the network's star. high priced flun-
kies and their lack of journalistic talents.

Renee Taylor and Joseph Bol-
ogna, who wrote the screenplay
and star in the film, are too hu-
man to obey the standard formu-
lae.

For one thing. neither is gla-
morous—she. as Gigs father in-
discreetly notes. sports a bump
on her nose. lines under her eyes.
and walks like a horse. He has a
charming double chin and a de-
lightful tendency to paunch.

Perhaps because they are actu-
ally married. Taylor and Bologna
wrote a script as mordant as it
is moving. The pain is not some
whispered. eyemisting Incurable
Disease. but the chops and blows
of people struggling to love.

The two are perfectly natural
in their roles. She keeps the chatty
Panda from grating; he stops
just short of making Gig a cad.

The film‘s major shortcom-
ing is in trying to offer a view-
from-the—couch analysis of what
ails Panda and Gig. Theif forma-
tive years are crammed, in but
scantily developed.

Thus. the minor roles are more
caricature than character.
Panda's mother is a Jewish Jean

wife where he is going in the
middle of the night. replies
with nary a twinkle. "To umpire

Banner was quite satisfied with
his teams performance. even
though they seemed to have been
affected by the grinding sche-
dule of this time of year.

"I was very pleased with the -
job the team did on Sunday."
commented Banner. “They were
tired from working hard and also
because midterm exams were
coming up. These factors didn't
make them as keen. as sharp. as
they generally are."

The Pitt mentor also tried
new combinations in his relay
teams to help him determine
what he has to work with in the
future.

"We tried different boys on
the relay t‘eams—we‘re trying to
find out what the younger boys.

he related.

Associate Sports Editor

After five years as a member of the Panther
basketball squad, Mike Paul is in the position of

‘being the ‘old man’ of the squad. Like an old vet-

eran, Paul analyzes the Panthers’ fortunes with
wisdom gained from experience.

Receiving a medical redshirt in his sopho-
more season due to an ankle injury, Paul has com-
peted through the four Buzz Ridl years on the
varsity. . V

at “The program has picked up tremendously '
since I came here as a_ walk-on." said Paul._
“Coach Ridl has done a tremendous job. Also, "

we’ve been getting some really great crowds
heref’ 5

Disappointed about the team's inability to
perform better this year, Paul offered his explana-
tion for the squad’s mediocrity.

.“The big difference .between this year and
last year is our defense—-we really miss Billy
Downes and Buzzy Harrison. Our"defense was a
lot more consistent last year.”

Paul, who has alternated between swing man
and guard this year, had his finest scoring effort
this year “against Penn State with 24 points. The
total boosted his scoring average to 12 points per
game, third behind Bill Knight and Kent Scott.

“Ive been playing more outside lately and
I’ve been able to drive more. Also, because of
where‘! play against a‘ man to man defense, I

get the ball more than against a zone, so I can
shoot more. ”

Mike, who hopes ‘to go to ‘law school next
year, cites last year’s convincing win over Du-

_ quesne as his biggest thrill at Pitt.

Panther fans at the Field House have often
chided Paul for his pronounced head fake before
shooting. But Mike shrugs it off ‘by saying, “You
get into the habit_of a fake and you come back to
itif it works.” ' - -

-Though‘ only /6-5,'Paul is 'th_ii'd in rebounds on.» *

‘OLD VET’ Mike Paul tries to m_ove around Kent

form that has enabled him to lift the Panthers_
numberless times during his five years at Pitt.

the squad, though-‘he realizes that he needs to
get good position to have a chance.

Mike’s forte» is his shooting and when he’s hot,

n his outside set. shot is deadly. Additionally. he

leads the team in free throw percentage shooting,

.a hefty 81-96. _

Though West Virginia has lost [half of its team
due to mishaps, Paul assesses Saturday night's en-

5 counter in Morgantown as crucial.

“I know that they think this game will be the
salvation for the season for them—they’ll be up for
us.” I ‘

With a gleam in his eye, the old vet. hinted
that winning Saturday night will be special to
him too. '

Teammate Chapela dominated
the balance beam event with an

captured her second first place
by the same score. ‘

The total point score of each

33.15, then Perozzi with a. 29.90.
However. the fourth highest to-

denced when comparing the Pink
Panthers scores with those of the
Nittany women gymnasts.

On the balance beam DeMa—‘

Penn State with a fine 6.8.

Representing Pitt on the all-
star squad will be defenseman
Kerry Browne and Glenn Hyde
and center Bill Glanville. Phil
Gefsky. Pitt's player-coach. has
been chosen to guide the team.

The team was originally-com-
prised of only two players from
each of the eight teams in the
league but coach Gefsky decided
toadd a few players to strength-
en the squad. '

“I looked over the squad and
it looked a little weak,” Gefsky
commenféd, “so I added a few
players.” _ ' _

Center iceman Glanville ech-
oed Gefsky's doubts saying.
"I think that the team_ isn't as
strong ,as it should be. The team
should have the best guys in the

.\ league on it. not just two from

each team.‘.'

"We have a lot of players on
our team that should be on. (the
all-star squad)" Glanville added.
"We could have had more than
five guys on the team easily.”

Gefsky is still opti_mistic about
beating the Knights. ‘‘I think if

we play a good defense then-
we’ll have a chance.”
