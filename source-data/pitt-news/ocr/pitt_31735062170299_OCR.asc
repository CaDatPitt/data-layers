DIALOGUE OF the’ world religions, East meets West under the Big Top.

s-),Pranksters’ Foul Class

Change Procedures

A by JUDY DECKER

How many classes did'you miss
the first three weeks of school be-
cause you weren’t aware of the
-room changes? If you missed one
class, this places you in the rank
of several hundred students. How
did such a mix-up occur? It was
caused by students who took a
rather “prankish attitude” to-
wards the class change cards tap-
ed to walls outside many class-
room doors.

Frank Reed of the Registrar’s
Office explained that most of the

' damage occurred in David Law-

rence Hall, where some of the
change cards were replaced four
times. At the end of one day‘ dur-
ing the second week of school,

only one change card was left"

posted in DL.

Several complaints were then
received by the Registrar's Of-
fice, and they first investigated
the maintenance crews, thinking
that they had perhaps moved the
cards during cleaning. The crews
denied that they had removed the
c Ids.

Later, it was discovered that
students were ripping down the
signs between classes. 'l‘he Regis-
trar’s policy on class change
cards is that as soon as a class
change is listed, an employee im-
mediately posts-a card-outside
the former classroom.

When a card is discovered to be
missing, .it is replaced immedi-
ately. Therefore, when students
rip off class change cards, they
are causing a greatinconvience
to fellow students and are wast-
ing the Registrar Office’s time.

. Reed also stated that the damage
1 done ‘to class change cards would
.‘ be considered serious if the Reg-

istrar?s Office wanted to take ac-
tion against offenders.

The Registrar’s Office reports
that it is pleasantly surprised to
find only. minor problems with

this year's processing. The in-‘

voicing had a high degree of cor-
rectness—-28,-200 students were
invoiced with only a few errors.

FRANK REED: Discovered student
_pranksters fouled up class change
procedures.

It took less time to wait in line
at the Registrar’s Office due to a
special training program for in-
dividuals not part of the regular
counter-staff. They were trained
so that when the lines swelled.
more help was available to pro-
cess the students more quickly.
However, _address changes did
present some problem in process-

On the edge of the Cathedral
lawn at Forbes and Bellefield is
a huge circus tent. The tent cost
$1,200 just-.to rent. At the mo-
ment, a rock group called “Life”
is beginning to wind up and a
small crowd is gathering. It‘s
11:45, Sept. 25, and the 1972 Ac-
tivities Fair is under way.

“What’s new in Army ROTC —
women!” Ten lovely female por-
traits underline the long trailer
truck advertisement for Army

. ROTC.

“Boycott Non-Union Lettuce.”
Inside the tent a thin, nervous,
pro-union volunteer rapidly ex-
plains the plight of the California
lettuce picker and asks me to sign
a petition. I sign and thus prom-
ise not to buy, sell, or eat non-un-
ion lettuce anymore.

“You are not alone. God is with
you.” The Christian Science Col-
lege organization is setting up.

I walk past W3YI, The Owl, Eu-
reka, Pitt" Young Democrats,
Robin Hood’s Merrie Band, and
right into a table of Army Re-
serve literature. (The Army Re-
serve set up two generators,
wired the tent, and donated all the
lights.)

Drill Team Stalled

Pantherettes Sidelined

by KAREN BURGIO
Envision the color and sounds of

l a football game—band, cheerlead-

ers, rnajorettes——and drill team.
. Believe it or not, the University

does have a a female drill team

called the Pantherettes. But don't
look for them on the football _field
this season, even though they have
new uniforms, because they won’t
be marching until basketball sea-
son. -

The Pantherettes; organized ‘two

, years ago, was recognized as an

organization only last fall. The
squad at present consists of 16.

The Student Government Allo-

cations Committee purchased new - -A

uniforms for the group this sum-
mer. They have yet to be seen in a
public appearance.

Consider the'pligh_t of Donald
Hower, Pitt’s new band director-
a man that must tackle a new
position, organize the band, he at-
tacked on the controversy of al-
lowing girls in the group,Iand, in

-addition work out practice sched-
ules with the newly formed Pan-
therettes.

“It’s hard for him to get the
band ready; he’s new at the school
so he doesn't really have time for
us,” said Pantherette member
and co-founder Debbie Dawson.
“But he likes the idea of the Pan-
therettes,” she added.

The Pantherettes were not al-
lowed to attend band camp in late
August, because, according to one
spokesman, camp was organized
too late in the season. This ended
any hopes ofmarching at the first
three. home football games, since

 

sures me that even if I receive a
draft induction notice, I can still
enlist in the reserves. “Why
should a student join the re-
serves?” I ask.

“The big advantage of being in -

the reserves is that a kid gets the
chance to serve his commitment
-and stay at home,” he replies.

“Far out.” It’s late afternoon
and a small crowd is applauding
the performance of the University
Dance Ensemble. It was a sur-
prising performance. “I didn’t
know Pitt had a Ballet Club,”
someone continued.

A few people are coming in and
out. They look around and some
pick up literature. The crowd is
small. '

In the background a record play-
er, amplified through two long
outdoor speaker columns, takes
the place of the rock group which
kicked off the Fair this morning.
Later, Sam Rozenzweig, co-chair-
man of the Men’s Council which is
sponsoring the group, explained
why the group quit playing.

“The administration made them
quit.

“We were getting complaints
from Carnegie, professors in the

Cathedral and some narrow mind-

ed people up in the Chancellor's
office told us to shut them down.

the band and require practice.

Meanwhile, morai‘ I both
groups began to drop: the band’s
because many young men-didn’t
like the idea of going coed; the
Pantherette’s because there was
no immediate marching date to
look forward to. Consequently,
both groups lost members.

“We could have marched at the
Boston College game, Oct. 21, but
because girls quit we had to hold
tryouts to recruit new members,
which meant the squad wouldn’t
be ready in time,” explained Daw-
son. ‘

The form asked the students to’
list a permanent and local ad-
dress. This is done with the hope
that invoices and grades sent to
the permanent address will reach
the students. Many people have
also complained about the due
date for invoices before classes

Reed stated that this is because
the office can determine who is

Reed stated that the Registrar’s

A group of top rated performers from
Ireland in the arts of singing, step dancing and
instruments, will appear at the Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall, , Oakland, Saturday,
October T4 at 8 p.m.

The appearance of this group is sponsored
by the Irish Center of Pittsburgh and provides

I us a rare opportunity to see Ireland's best per-

form. i

Reserved seat tickets at $3 and $4 are
now available from Pitt Student Union or by
calling M. O’Shea . . . 361-6440.

Our shows are such that we don’t
really need them, because they
wouldn’t fit in with our show. We
try to present the best show pos-
sible and bigness is not necessari-
ly a sign of goodness.

“They haven’t demonstrated any
organization yet, that’s what the
band would like to see and that’s
the main complaint of the band.
Our director has never met the
advisor of the Pantherettes. How-
er has gone out of his way to talk
to these girls and he’s told them
what the situation is.

“.I don’t see why we should be
forced to accommodate a group
that 'isn’t organized and is rid-
dled with internal conflict. To
date, the Pantherettes havenot
demonstrated any ability to per-
form,” Alstadt said.

Band Director Hower had “no
comments at all” when asked
about the Pantherette situation.

Confidence of Young Vote Sought

 

by BETH BELL

In a concentrated effort to win
the confidence of the young, R.
Sargent Shriver, Democratic
Vice Presidential nominee, spoke
before an assembly of high school
students at Central Catholic High
School Monday morning.

The main thrust of Shriver’s
speech was emphasized as he
spoke of the “government’s single
resource . . . the young people.”

“If anyone can reach across the
barriers of fear . . . it’s the young
people. The real future of the
world lies in the hands of the
young. Young people in the United
States must take the lead,” ac-
cording to Shriver.

Students, not officially notified
of Shriver’s-appearance at the
school until that morning, greeted
him with a standing ovation. In-
troductory remarks were made

' by Congressman William F.

Moorhead.

One of Shriver’s main ideas was
that “work is the first essential
dignity.” The McGovern-Shriver

‘*"7ticket promises jobs for the un-

employed, while downgrading the
present policy of President Nixon.

‘ “Both John Connelly and Richard

Nixon believe that a 5.5 unemploy-
ment is normal..Let them join the

,LlGHTNING-fingered guitarist
Alvin Lee will be the Civic
Arena on Friday, Oct. 6, with
his group Ten Years After. Also '
on the bill-will be Edgar Win-
ter. The quartet is best known
for its appearance in the mo-
viav Woodstock. Tickets are
available at National Record
Marts.

ranks of the unemployed.”

Also included in a list of targets
were the tax loopholes from which
businesses are known to profit.
According to Shriver, “U.S. Steel
paid no taxes in 1970. Ronald Rea-
gan, Governor of California, did
not pay.” He later added that nei-
ther he nor members of his family
have used more than five per cent
of the legal loopholes available.

Shriver remarked that "money
made by money should be taxed
the same as money made by men.”

“Too much money is wasted in
the Pentagon. It is top heavy with
brass. We want to take money

I from them and put it in education

and health. The educational fu-
ture is more important the mili-
tary future.”

Although he relied heavily on
his Catholic background, Shriver
made no mention of the McGovern
stance on abortion or aid to the
parochial schools. He did refer to
the national spirit of the ethnic
groups he has been concentrating
on during the campaign.

“The Jews of Israel would rath-
er die on a strip of desert than

   

  I Shriver Addresses Youth

have another holocast in concen-
tration camps. This spirit has
kept the Irish fighting. This spir-
it has kept the Polish fighting.
Shriver concluded by remark-
ing, “We (McGovern-Shriver) ran.
not just to offer jobs, or to stop
the war, but to offer a commun-
ion with the people, to make a
country that you and I believe in,
and would be willing to die for.”

A question-answer period fol-
lowed Shriver’s speech in which
he was asked why Nixon main-
tained a lead in the electoral polls.
Shriver explained that Nixon is
profiting from being around, and
people would rather keep some-
one they know in office even if
they do not like him. The one time
director of the Peace Corps also
reminded the audience that in
areas where McGovern and he
have spoken, the Democratic tick-
et has surged from a trailing posi-
tion. _ \

Following the assembly for jun-
iors and seniors of Central Catho-
lic, Shriver headed for the gym-
nasium to speak with sophomores
and "freshmen before leaving for
the airport.

McGovern to Close Tax

by JAMES PROZZI
College Young Democrats

“The rich get richer, and the
poor get poorer.” So 62 per cent
of white America told the Harris
Roll in 1971. But unfortunately
this often-quoted phrase is not sim-

 ’ ply a cliche with no basis in fact.
‘ 7 For the gap between the rich and

poor is widening; today the low-
est fifth of American families get
3.2 per cent of the national in-

‘ V come; the top fifth 45.8 per cent.
_ ' The sad part is that this maldistri-
. ' bution has been getting worse, not
if V better. In 1949, the riches one per

cent of the population owned 21

 .per cent of the wealth. The prime

cause of this unequal distribution:
loopholes in the tax laws which un-

ll _ fairly favor the wealthy.

Indeed nothing disturbs the av-
erage working man and woman
more than the realization that
they are being squeezed by high

'» taxes while the rich and the pow-
9 -- erful corporations pay less. In
.. 1972, no issue, aside from the war

in ‘Indochina, has produced as

 .much emotion. In the Wisconsin

primary, the issue was tax re-

 form. Both Georges, McGovern
. ’ _-and Wallace, received their.loud-
*'est.responses when denouncing

tax loopholes. Nevertheless, the
administration is trying to con-

_ “Vince the country that federal tax
. ‘ laws are reasonably fair and

‘ ‘equitable,'and do loopholes really
.~ _ add up to billions in lost revenue?

Our tax laws are “graduated”-'

 {T-supposedly written with the inten-
",5 tion of making those higher in-
  comes pay a higher percentage in
, if "taxes than those with lower in-
f}  comes. It supposedly says that the
'.§..~_ rich need a smaller share of their
 income for
 7" those with lower incomes spend
 almost all of it on the things they

necessities since

need to live. But loopholes in the

 law -have permittedlegalized ‘tax
" evasion. Indeed, the poor and
1 middle class currently pay a high-

er percentage of their income in

 taxes than do the richest ohe per

cent of the population. For in 1968,

 Treasury Secretary Barr did tell
gs, ., Congress that middle income
 ‘Americans — those making be-
 tween $7,000 and $20,000 a year-
-" ».-paid a higher percentage of their

Loopholes for Corporations

incomes to the federal govern-
ment than the richest one per cent
of Americans. He also revealed
that, in 1967, 155 taxpayers who
earned $200,000 or more—includ-
ing 21 millionaires, paid no tax at
all. (By 1970, there were 301 tax
dodgers in the $100,000 plus
bracket.) And those who did pay
taxes paid at an effective rate of
25 per cent—the rate that is sup-
posed to hit those with one-

fiftieth of a millionaire’s income.

In April, 1971, two Census De-
partment officials revealed that
the real tax rate of $50,000-a-
year families was the same as for
$5,000-a-year families——because
the affluent family had so many
opportunities to deduct, exempt,
and shelter their actual wealth.
And the Tax Foundation in 1970 es-
timated that families earning un-
der $10,000-a-year paid 28.6 per
cent of their income in taxes;
those of incomes of $1 million or
more paid 28.4 per cent. So much
for our fair and equitable tax
laws!

Some comparisons will drive
the point even closer to home. If
a breadwinner with a family of
four earns a‘ salary of $10,000 he
pays federal income taxes in 1972
of $905. But the taxpayer with the
same income from sale of stock

or land pays only $98 in taxes. The

reason‘? Stocks are not taxed at

' “ordinary income” rates but at a

“capital gains” rate—a tax that
exempts half the profit. from tax-
ation. And since state and muni-
cipal bonds are tax-free, if a tax-
payer had made his $10,000 from
these, he would pay no taxes at
all. The burden is thus on earned
income, on the man driving a
taxi, standing at an assembly line,
stringing wires from poles. The
worker simply can’t escape taxes
on earned income because they
are withheld right from his pay-
check. Ironically he may work for
a big corporation like US Steel
which netted $154 million and
skipped 1971 income taxes alto-
gether. It was perfectly legiti-
mate, of course—the company had
tax shelters for earned income. '

The loss of revenue from these

tax shelters is enormous. US
Steel is no isolateaé case. For an

Editor's Note: This is the second
in a series of debates between the
College Republicans and the Col-
lege Young Democrats on current
campaign issues. Starting with this
issue, the Communist Party will
also present their views.

The debates will appear in this
space every Wednesday until the
election.

These articles do not necessarily
reflect the official positions, but
rather the opinions of the individ-
ual writers.

The subject of today's debate. is
tax reform.

Internal Revenue Service Report
on corporate tax returns for June
1969-1970 shows that 43 per cent of
/all US corporations in that per-

iod paid not a cent in federal in- '

come tax. How many American
families can make that state-
ment? These corporations escap-
ed taxes because they took full
(and legal) advantage of loop-
holes: generous depreciation and
depletiion allowances, invest-

ment credits, and foreign tax’

credits.

The most gaping hole for this
loss of revenue is the oil deple-
tion allowance. Despite a 1969 law
trimming the allowance (which
is a deduction for the risks of oil
drilling)- to 22 per cent from 27.5

I wish to register the strongest
possible complaint to this policy.
I am not the least impressed by
your tales of the thousands
of ‘dollars that have been stolen

you can surely pay someone to

I suggest that you leave and make

disbuse yourself of this notion im-
mediately. It may be that this ac-
tion is not a violation of the letter

seem to be an error on the part of
those who wrote the contract) but
it is certainly a violation of the

Nixon’s Federal Spending
Approach ‘Responsible’

by LYNN ALSTADT
Chairman, College Young Republicans

In every political campaign politicians promise lower taxes, but
this year the question of tax reform has been heavily pushed by the
Democrats. Therefore, a look at our current tax system will be very
useful in understanding the daily debates over tax reform. Such an in-
vestigation reveals that our tax system has remained essentially un-
changed for over 20 years and that Congress has been reluctant to
change that system. In fact, the only tax reforms passed by'Congress
in recent years were initiated by President Nixon shortly after he took
office in 1969.

It is curious to note, however, that Senator McGovern, during all
of his years in the Senate, never offered or advocated a tax reform bill
until he became a candidate for President. Since that time he has of-
fered a different tax proposal every month. It is also unusual that the
Democrats have been screaming about tax loop-holes while they milk
every one of them for their own benefit. For example, Stewart R.
Mott, General Motors heir and McGovern’s most steadfast contributor,
gave the Democratic candidate 30 separate gifts of stocks. These
stocks were then sold on the market and Mr. Mott was repaid his ini- A
tial price for the stock. The difference between Mr. Mott’s purchase
price and the current market value was Mr. Mott’s contribution.
Through this donative sale of stock the capital gains tax on $98,882 was
avoided (New York Times, Sept. 25, 1972). -

. The most crucial point of this controversy, however, is not tax
reform but tax relief. It is not enough to talk about redistributing the
tax burden. Government must he made more cost effective and taxes
must be cut. The Nixon administration has reduced their own operat-

ing budget and has given Americans the biggest tax cut in history.‘.r‘-'_,

President Nixon is currently studying ways to reduce the property tax
which is such an unfair and heavy burden for the poor, the elderly, the
wage earner, the farmer, and those on fixed incomes. He is fighting for
a federal spending limit to prevent the need for increased taxes. The
opposition, on the other hand offers a platform that promises every-
thing to everybody and would mean a?50 per cent tax increase for tax-
payers of America.

President‘ Nixon offers a responsible approach to federal spending.
He is working for not only tax reform but also tax relief for all Ameri-
cans.

Communist Party to
Correct inadequacies

by NANCY BITENSKY A 

Co-Chairwomen, Hall-Tyner-Henderson Campaign Committee

The Communist Party of the U.S.A. has a tax program that would
alleviate the burden of taxes on the workers and shift it to the giant
corporations. Our candidates, Gus Hall, general secretary of the
CP, USA, a former steelworker and one of the founders of the United
Steelworkers of America, is running for President. Jarvis Tyner, the

national chairman of the Young Workers Liberation League, a former

Teamster and a leader in the Black liberation movement, is running
for Vice-President, and Naside Henderson, a Black youth running
against William Moorhead for Congress in the 14th District. Hender-
son is the local chairman of the YWLL and CD and will put forth our
program which will pave the way to an end of the war, racism and re-
pression. '

Our program would not tax the incomes under $15,000. We would
close all loopholes now, end all sales and excise taxes, property taxes
on small homeowners and social secruity taxes on workers.

Under the Nixon administration 100 top corporations—out of a
total of over 1.5 million corporations—own and control over one-half of
the nation’s wealth compared with 45 per cent in 1965 and 40 per cent
in 1950. »

These are the same corporations that are supposed to be controlled
by the phony wage-price regulations. Their billions of dollars of prof-
its—earned at the expense of Americans and Vietnamese who have
died in the Indochina battlefields have been soaring to the astronomical
sum of over one-half trillion dollars since the esclation of the bombings
of N. Vietnam first began in 1965.

' These corporations have been on a profits binge ever since Nixon
came into office. They raked in more money in the first quarter of 1972

than in any previous three month period in history. The 100 largest cor- .

porations scored a 76 per cent rise in profits over the past year alone.

7 Compare this with the soaring costs borne by the working peoplegé
especially the super-exploited Black Americans, Chicanos, native
Americans, Puerto Ricans and Asians. In July alone the price of meats,
poultry and fish soared to over'10 per cent of the previous year.

Last year under the Nixon administration working people paid 76
per cent of all federal income taxes. The capitalists and their agents

paid 24 per cent. For comparison, in 1941 the workers paid 45 per cent.

of federal taxes while the capitalists paid 56 per cent.

The shifting of the tax burden amounts to a swindle of $45 billion a
year out of the pockets of the American workers. Of the total amount

paid by workers for federal taxes 90 per cent goes to war—especially .

the barbaric war in Indochina.

What does this have to do with students? Students also suffer from,
the rising prices, high taxes, and not to mention high tuitions. We too
suffer from a laclt of jobs, poor housing, andinadequate medical care.
Therefore, I calf on all students ' to cast the most meaningful vote,’

It was a strange crowd, gath-

And Ravi gave them their mon-

tabla and tamboura, played by
Alla Rakha and Nodu Mullick, re-

Soon the pace became faster

Moss was ready and, unfortun-
tely, so were the Florida State
Seminoles.-
This spring, after having spent
he majority of his grid career at
'tt"as a halfback, Moss was con-
rted back to his original posi-
n as a defensive end. This met-
orphosis, however, had little
ime to take effect as he was
truck down by the FSU Semin-

During that contest Moss be-
came one of the many Panther

bug.” He was knocked out of ac-
ion two weeks ago suffering from

disappointment to‘Moss who, be-

Freshmen Part Of Pitt Grid Picture

and the only encouraging sign on
the street was freshman football
player Paul Mariano.

Mariano, decked in his brand
new blue traveling football blazer
was up rather early. Two hours
later, Mariano would be one of
three freshmen traveling to Colo-
rado Springs, Colo., for the Pitt
Air Force football game.

His masculine face wore a half
smile and as he walked down the
dorm steps to the street,,He
straightened his tie, assessed the
quality of his white slacks and
‘strode off somewhere, maybe to
grab a morning cup of coffee.

Not only would the three travel
to the Big Sky State, but they
would play a part in what turned
out to be a rather humiliating Pan-
ther show.

Before the season started and
after the ECAC ruling allowing
frosh to play for Pitt and other
Eastern schools, head- football
coach Carl DePasqua assured
that the only way any freshmen
were going to see any action was
if they were extremely good.

Had it not been for the ECAC

ruling, it is realized now, DePas—'

‘ Moss’ Switch Delayed  

Moss’ shock is certainly under-
standable. The last time he had
played his favorite position of de-
fensive end was as a freshman
when he was considered a stand-
out in that spot. But the coaches
liked his size “for a power attack
on the ground” and so he was
transformed into a halfback.

“I was never meant to be a half-
back, I’m too big of a target,”
commented Moss. “I was really
pleased with the switch back to
defense,” he continued. “I had a
decent spring and I learned a lot
from Coach Gottfried (coach of
the defensive ends). It was like a
whole new lease on life.’’

Moss though is unsure how long
Pitt’s lease on life in the ’72 cam-
paign will be.

“I don’t know what will happen
the rest of the season, it’s up to
the players,” said Moss. “In Sat-
urday’s game, Northwestern and
Pitt will both be looking for a win.

Lewis

by RICK ROSENTHAL

Tuesday afternoons scheduled
baseball game with the Point
Park Pioneers was canceled by
Coach Bob Lewis because the
contest did not meet the needs of
the team. In its place was sched-
uled a Blue-Gold intra squad game
which would give a maximum
number of players an opportunity
to display their talent.

The fall season for Point Park
is not used for the purpose of find-
ing new players but instead is the
equivalent of Pitt‘s spring season.

The fall season has been quite a

productive period for discovering

new talent ‘for Lewis with pitch-
_ers being on the top of his list.
Senior Ed Banaszak and fresh-
man Jerry Jury and Don Kennedy
are the players who have most
impressed Lewis so far this short
season.‘ ‘
Banaszak played on the squad
last year as a utility infielder and

’got very little if any playing time, .

“an occurence which won't be re-
-peated this year,” said Lewis. So

qua would be in much more hot
water than he is, In the first
three games, freshman have play-
ed quite a bit of collegiate football.

Because the Panthers have lost
at least five starters‘, depth,
which the freshmen were suppos-
ed to supply, became lacking be-
cause the depth had to take over

A in the starting positions. In that

might be part of the sad story of
this year’s record, so far. ’

Tom Perko played a fair amount
of defensive end at Air Force. He
spelled. the veterans Jim Buck-
mon, Rod Kirby, and Eric Knise-

ly. John Strom, the other mem- ‘

ber of the Cub trio.,was playing of-
fensive tackle when Bill Daniels
led the Panthers to'their second
and last touchdown.

Whoever wins will be showing the
start of a good season. Pitt has to
look to this one first before they
start thinking about the rest of the
season—the games are going to
get tougher from here on out.”

The Panther gridder feels that
the Pitt squad is upset with their
performance so far but he also
feels that both the offense and the
defense are sound more or less.

“I can’t say that I’m down on
the offense and the defensive sys-
tems,” stated Moss. “They have
to get themselves together—they
have to keep their chins up and
keep playing.

“But I’ve been away. I go to
practices but I’m not close to
them,” he added. ‘‘It’s a differ-.
ent ‘mental feeling when you’re
notplaying.”

And that feeling is something

John Moss wants to rectify and ~

he may get his chance against
Navy or Penn State.

Pleased

far this season Ed has pitched
two scorelessiinnings where he
relied on a good fastball to go
along with his lively curve ball.
Jury also has hurled two score-
less innings for the mitters which
were highlighted by his fine con-
trol.

Kennedy seemed o impress
Lewis the most of the three pitch-
ers and according to Lewis. "He
will be a winner here for a long
time. He is not an overpowering
hurler. but instead usually shows
excellent control. which is the
mark of a good pitcher.“

The fall season has also shown
that the team is a well balanced
squad which does not have to de-
pend on the hitting of any single

player in the way last years team _

relied on Ken Macha. Pete Mar-

*torelli. Joe Groetch. anny Slain.

Rick Monroe. and Paul Quaran-
tillo are all consistent hitters who
Lewis feels he can rely on in the
clutch.

The emergence of Slain as a
good hitter, as witnessed by his

hitting so far this year, hascr_eat- _'

With

   

along as access, baggage. Neither
did Mariano. Mariano was an hon-
orable mention All—American out
of Naugatuck, Mass. He was in at
defensive tackle and also receiv-
ed a slight injury to his knee to
remember the trip.

“I wasn’t even sure if I was go-
ing .to dress for. the home games,”
Strom said. “I was really happy
when I found out I was going to
Air Force.”

Perko and Mariano were -also
pleasantly surprised, even though
they were disappointed by the
trip’s result.

“I wouldn’t have minded stay-
ing in Colorado for a week if we
had won,” said Perko. “I don’t
think I would like to stay much
longer than that. After we lost, I
wanted to go home.‘-’.

Mariano felt the same way.

“It was disappointing,” he stat-
ed very matter of factly.

For sure, these three future
stars were making statements
they would be ordinarily making
in their sophomore years, if they
were lucky. Here they were re-
ceiving their baptisimal of fire at
the very start of their collegiate
careers.

All three of them though seem-
ed to have their chests extended
out a little bit farther than usual.
Pride was beaming from all their
faces. Not necessarily for the out-
come of the game,'but because
they were wearing a blue blazer
with a Golden Panther running
across the word Pitt,‘ etched ont
the coat’s pocket. »

Maybe, that’s whyiMariano got
a head start on everybody on Fri-

day morning. To show off just a ’

bit.

. “Why have patrons to Pitt football games been stopped and

violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United

States:

ANSWER: Casmir Myslinski—Pitt Athletic Director

“We have a responsibility to see that everyone in the Stadium
is safe. We are not frisking, but stopping people and are asking
them to open up packages that might contain bottles.

‘‘In the past, bottles have been thrown. We are trying to pro-
tect somebody’s head. We don’t take the bottles. They are marked
and can_be picked up the following Monday. If they are not picked
up, they are disposed of at the end.‘ of the season.”

ed a. nice problem for Lewis.
Who is to play third‘? Quarantillo
last year’s third baseman led the
team in hitting with a .379 aver-
age and seems too valuable to
platoon this year with Slain.

The answer to mitter third base
problem will be found in the out;
field the coach said with either
Slain or Quarantillo being play-
ed there. Lewis feels he definitely
will not loose anything defensive-

ly because both guys have excep-
tionally good throwing arms. -

The short fall season ends Fri-
day afternoon at Steubenville
where the mitters will play a dou-
bleheader against a team they
easily defeated early in their
short season, 9-2. Lewis plans to
play every member on the squad.
to give them one last chance to
show their talents before the sea-
son ends.

Delta Sigma Chi
Wins Mitt Game

by VICKY VETERE

Monday evening Delta hi took their second win of the season as 
they squeezed past Delta Sigma Chi by a score of 2 to 1. ' '

Moving into Monday’s game Delta Phi was 1 and 1 (having taken I 
a crushing defeat at the handsof Fiji). and Delta Sigma Chi had played
only one game which they lost. ‘ E

The game came to a quick start as Bob "Stif'f” Shields of Delta Phi
belted the second pitch of the ball game far into left field for a home
run. Then in the bottom of the first Delta Sigma Chi took to the bat and
churned in a run. . i I

With the score tied at 1-1, there came a lull in the action during the
second inning and the only exciting occurences were a few foul balls hit
into the parking lot. -‘

 

  
   
    
  
    
   
    
       
        
   

The third inning saw one dramatic play as Ed Huot (“PJ”) of Del-
ta Phi ran _forward on a quickly dropping fly ball and executed a per-
fect catch in mid-air.

\

Then the big fifth inning rolled along and 01’ “Stiff” got _a base hit
and was now three for three. Another base hit advanced him to second
and then Huot stepped up to bat. He let loose a whollop right up the mid-
dle, which Delta Sigma Chi’s pitcher missed and which their second -
baseman fumbled. This brought Shields home in whatvturned out to be
‘the winning run.
