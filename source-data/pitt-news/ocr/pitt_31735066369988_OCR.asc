_ ’84 Warm-Up
Local DemocratsPlan
RunAgainst Reagan

 

By PEGGY FERRI

Local democratic organizations
sponsored a political skills and
political information workshop at
David Lawrence Auditorium
yesterday to propose strategies for
defeating President Ronald Reagan
in the I984 presidential elections.

The day-long workshop was
sponsored by the Allegheny County
Democratic Committee, the
Americans for Democratic Action,
the National Organization of

Women and the United Steel
Workers of America. County
Commissioner , Cyril Wecht

provided the opening remarks.

Duquesne law professor Bruce
Ledewitz summed up the tone of the
workshop, saying “There is no bad
democrat to be stopped...we all
agree that whoever wins will be
better than Reagan.” '

The workshop’s co-chairman,
Jonathan Robison, echoed that
thought. “The idea here is to build
coalitions and do what we can to
beat Reagan in the next elections."

“Victory in I984,” a workshop
concentrating on strategies for a

democratic victory, laid out the
 

‘‘I don't see how we
can lose unless we
all stay home."

—Molly Yard

details of what was termed a‘
deteriorating situation.
Molly Yard, of the National

Organization of Women (NOW),
said she does not see how Reagan
could win the election considering
all the groups who are against him.

“I don't see how we can lose unless
we all stay at home," Yard said. “But
I do notice there is not a show of very
great enthusiasm [on the part of the
democrats].

“We all can't stand Reagan, but
there is no overriding passion," she
explained. She contrasted this

     

  

campaign with that of McGovern in
1972, saying that there was a feeling
of a crusade that year, something
that is lacking now.

But this is a different campaign,
Yard said. The voter turnout is
going to be positive, she reasoned,
because the voters have been
polarized, and the vote against a
candidate is the most powerful.

She predicted that the gender gap,
the gap between men and women
voters, is going to be important in
deciding the elections. This is
primarily because women and their
children are becoming the
fastest-growing group living in
poverty, she said.

“Women are very aware of the

' effect Reagan is having on us," she

explained. She added that cuts in
nutrition programs have made a
great impact, including several
studies which attest to adverse
effects on children.

“Studies show that children are
not as tall, and doctors warn that a
child’s brain can never catch up after
undernourishment," she said.

Yard continued to outline the
policies of the Reagan
administration toward civil rights,
labor and the environment.

“We must unite behind a
candidate," she explained, “because
it means everything. NOW passed a
resolution against independent
candidates because an independent
candidate [who could split the vote
for democrats] would be a disaster.

“We must work as if our lives
depended on it because our lives do
depend on it,” she said.

Representatives for democratic
presidential candidates discussed
party platforms. Pitt political
science major Avery Abrams spoke
for Senator Alan Cranston; Ken
Gray spoke for Senator John Glenn
and Ledewitz spoke for Senator"
Gary Hart. Although the spokesmen
could not speak directly to the
issues, they answered questions and

explained why they supported their

candidates.
Abrams emphasized Cranston.’s

' resolve to work for a nuclear freeze

citing disasterous outcomes if this
policy is not followed. Abrams said
he believes Cranston is not a liberal
extremist, but a realist.

Silent Homecoming
Raises Questions

By PAM CYGRYMUS

When most students think. of
homecoming, they think of parades,
football and theibig concert. Pitt stu-
dents s_urveye.d on campus’ want to
know where the big concert is this
year.

Last year, Pitt students filled
David Lawrence Auditorium —
twice —to hear Donnie Iris and the
Cruisers perform two shows. This
year, the Pitt Program Council
Homecoming Committee couldn’t
land a , musical act and decided
instead to bring comedian David
Brenner to Pitt.

Brenner was at Pitt in late May to
discuss his first book, “Soft Pretzels
With Mustard,” but homecoming
organizers were not worried about
bringing him back so soon.

“He was -here as a lecturer, not as a
comedian,” Heidi Holler, chairper-
son of the PPC's Concert Commit-
tee said.

According to Holler, the PPC
“exhausted all possibilities” to bring
a band to Pitt before settling on
Brenner. She said the Homecoming
Committee started with a list of
about 50 bands including George

Benson, Billy Idol, The Gap ‘Band,
 ,

“He (David Bren-
ner) was here as a
lecturer, not as a
comedian.”
‘—Heidi Holler

 
The Motels, Naked Eyes and The

' Fixx.

None of those bands could be
available for the homecoming date.
Holler said she discussed the scarcity

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences

Council (FASC) elected Roberti

Ewald, CAS, as its vice president at
an organizational meeting Friday. '
The council accepted FAS dean
Jerome Rosenberg’s proposal that
the department of biological scien-
ces be once again designated as one
of the FAS’ three departments on
the University Research Council.
The three-year term of biological
science had run out this year. The
department will now be a part of the
council until 1986, joining the
departments of chemistry -(l98l-
I984) and physics and astronomy
(I982-1985). ‘ I

The departments are chosen on
the basis of the dollar volume of
sponsored-research expenditures
during_ the previous fiscal year. In
the fiscal year 1983, biological scien-
ces ranked first in this category with
$3.22 million in research expendi-
tures, followed by chemistry with
$3.21
astronomy, $3.06 ‘million.

The council also accepted the
dean’s _proposal that the depart-
ments of communication, computer
science, economics, history, mathe-
matics and statistics and philosophy

be designated members of the Col-i ‘

lege of General Studies Council. The
departments are chosen to provide
representation from those depart-.

ments which provide the largest ,
amount of CGS instruction and/ or‘ ’

deal with the largest number of CGS
majors. .

Clark Muenzer, an associate pro-
fessor in the German department,
was named as a member of the FAS
Budget Policies Committee.
Muenzer said yesterday that he did
not know very many details of what
the committee was working on but
that, “I hope to learnia lot, quickly.”

The council elected a member-at-

' large to the University Council on

Graduate Study, but Rosenberg said
the name is being withheld until the
candidate is notified‘ and he or she
accepts the position. * _

Jim Scott, news anchor and ‘
reporter for WPXI television,
said that local stations need to
develop stronger community
relations and to try not to imitate
the networks.

V Scott's remarks were delivered
as part of a workshop titled,

‘“Turning an Idea Into Reality,”
held Saturday in the William Pitt
Union. 0

“Community, that’s what it‘s
all about,” Scott said. “Give
them what they want, then go
from there.”

Scott began his lecture with an
introduction on how he began
working in the news business. He
had always wanted to be a news-
caster. So one day, he simply

His work in radio introduced
him to making mistakes.. He
recalled how, one day while on
the air, he knocked over. a cup of
coffee and blew out the new
$10,000 console installed only
that morning.

“These things will happen,”
Scott said. “They made me a
stronger broadcaster."

“All of a sudden a male voice
told me, “I just think you're so
wonderful,” Scottsaid. “ I can’t.
tell you how I felt, it scared me
quite a bit.”

Television is farfrom a perfect - ’

“I have fun with it,‘ I enjoy it.

We have been witness to bloodshed this
weekend which is a warning that the situation in J

Lebanon is deteriorating, and further
involvement on the part of the United States, in
the name of peace, could cost the country more
than it can realistically afford. I

With the Marine death count at 140 and rising,
how many more body bags have to return before
the U.S. reconsiders its priorities and objectives?
It has never been more clear that the time has
come to debate American troop involvement and
examine the justifications (if any) for our
continued presence in Lebanon.

The peace-keeping troops were originally
dispatched to separate the Israelis from various
Moslem factions with whom they were in
conﬂict. The Israelis have since withdrawn,
leaving the Americans, French and Italians to

I face hostile forces with no clear policy‘ objectives 1

in mind. i
The question here is ' whether
peace-keeping forces can achieve any objectives
by merely being placed in defensive positions
where they are of little more value than clay
pigeons — waiting to be attacked again.

The U.S. forces that support the Gemayel
regime are, in effect, supporting a government.
which is not representative of all the Lebanese
people. They are understandably perceived as
“The Enemy” and can expect to be attacked
again.

This view is echoed ‘by the most unlikely
politicians and spokesmen for the Reagan
Administration. Stansfield Turner, former head
of the CIA, not known for his compromising
views on foreign policy, recognizes this situation
as one that must be turned around.

To turn it around, however, requires broad
debate to arrive at clear policy objectives and,
more importantly, to articulate them.

This is no time for simple solutions to an
obviously complex problem. Having no clear
policy is a recipe for disaster — a disaster that the
U.S. neither wants nor needs. We should
withdraw our troops until the reasons forour

I presence are clear. '

Taxi cabs and teenagers in jacked-

congested city streets.

As far as I can tell from walking
the streets of Oakland everyday, a
pedestrian is something that should
be either runover or kept perma-

It's a common trait in city drivers;
they step on the gas and race from
one red light to the next trying to see
who can get there first. It s been
rumored that pedestrians are worth
10 points each. There seems to be
quite a few drivers trying to rack-up
points in Oakland.

but I did not go to the streets to
demonstrate. ‘ A

I followed Voltaire’s adage of, “In
the case of news, we should always
for the sacrament of
confirmation.” In this case, Voltaire
proved correct for all of the
demonstrations were decidedly
anti-Israel while the results of the

. Kahan investigation proved that the

massacre was carried out by the
Ketab — the Christian Phalange.
Once this was proven, the outrage
abated to, if anything, a murmur.
Thoughout the Lebanese Civil

War and prior to Israel’s
‘ involvement, countless civilians
_ were massacred. Israel, together

with Zionists throughout the world,
spoke with a single voice and
regrettably the only voice, in
condemning and attempting to
focus world attention upon these

them would find a better way to get
their kicks than playing chicken with
pedestrians.

I’m not sayingthat all city drivers
are out to mow people down, but if
your crossing between blocks and
you drop something would you have
the nerve to run back and get it? I’m»
not sure if I would. A

Each person is different behind
the wheel and~it’s not fair to lump
everyone into one group of thought-
less drivers. But it’s a certainty that
at a four abroad traffic light one of
those cars will move up regardless of
pedestrians who have not com-
pletely crossed the street.

The busy streets like Forbes and
Fifth Avenues are relatively predic-
table danger zones. But side streets
are as unpredictable as a Joey Chet-
wood training center.

A driver who goes 55mph and
more on a city street should
seriously question his sanity. It's one
thing to be in a hurry, but does a
person walking always have to look
over his shoulder as well as both
ways?

Speeders are dangerous, but peo-
ple who ignore stop signs are worse.
I’d like to call attention to anyone
reading this one stop sign, that is
almost always ignored. The stop
sign at the corner of Forbes Quad-
rangle which is supposed to stop
traffic that flows in front of Mervis
Hall and into the libraries parking
lot is a joke. , .

no world outcry over these deaths or
over the cruel and calculated murder
of over l5,000 Syrian rebels in the
town of Hama by the Syrian
government.

I, together with my friends, had
hoped that if anything, the tragedy
of Sabra and Shatilla had raised the
world’s level of consciousness. This,
unfortunately, is not true. The
memory of those civilians brutally
murdered in Sabra and Shatilla has
been desecrated. This desecration is
being committed by every person
who took to the streets to
demonstrate at the time of the
massacre. This desecration is being
perpetrated by every newspaper,
with the exception of The New York
Times, which ran a banner headline
concerning the Sabra and Shatilla
massacre.

This week, it was revealed that
hundreds of Lebanese civilians were

massacred during the
Druse/ Lebanese fighting. These
victims were, according to the

Times, “slain en masse in a cold
blooded, ruthless manner, without
regard to age, sex or involvement in-
the fighting." These men, women
and children were not casualties of

;_ the war but rather, victims of brutal P

Walking A Dangerous Business

Pittsburgh police have made
"occasional efforts — such as at
lunchtime — to stop people from
doing this. But at other times of the
day and when police don’t patrol,
which is rare, you had better be
ready to run across the street.

_I’m not surehow many people
have actually been run down in the
local streets, but I predict that at
least one will occur by year’s end at
this intersection.

A bad angle for pedestrians cross-
ing the street and people ignoring
stop signs at high speeds is a danger-
ous combination. I sincerely hope
something is done about his prob-
lem because I, for one, cross that
street several times a day, and am
not anxious to say I told you so.

Just for the record I’d like to list
the more danerous types of drivers:

0 Teenagers in any make or model
of car. _

0 Taxi drivers who couldn’t make
the cuts on the NASCAR circuit.

0 Business men late for their three-

a martini lunch.

0 Business men after their three-
martini lunch.

0 Truck drivers
smaller than a semi.

O Ambulances and policemen who
are in a hurry to get back to the
station to see “Hill Street Blues” or
“Trauma Center."

0 Any driver with fire in their eyes
and a heavy right foot. ' t

By not demonstrating against the

NON-PALESTINIAN Arab

"brethren, those who demonstrate

show that their “outrage" was little
more than. another propaganda
ploy. The deaths of those civilians in
Sabra and Shatilla were used by the
organizers of those events as but
another tool to rally public opinion
against Israel. It is impossible to
place a specific value upon human
life. It is unforgivable to believe that
one people’s lives are worth more
than another’s. _

I, together with the University of
Pittsburgh’s Zionist student groups,
condemn the massacres of civilians
which have occurred throughout the

long and. bloody civil war in
Lebanon. Perhaps more than
anything else, I condemn the

hypocrisy of those who seek to use
these tragedies selectively for

The Pitt News, Monday, October 24, I983

‘Page. 5- .-

Dear Worm:

Once again you have failed to
gather facts before telling the
story. You must enjoy removing
your foot from your big mouth.

Your story about Regina Hix
was not complete (as usual).

Does it not seem strange that
Ms. Hix would be the only per-
son, out ofthousands of cafeteria
users, to find a worm in her food?
Why, if Ms. Hix just wanted to
alert the cafeteria officials that
there could be contamination in
the food, did she also want to

- change her meal plan? Could it
possibly be that Ms. Hix just
wanted to reduce her meal plan
after the prescribed dates on her
food service contract? lsn’t it a
bit suspicious that she would still
want any meal plan at all (instead
of changing from 19 meals to 10
meals per week)? The majority of
people that I questioned would
not return to any restaurant
where they had found a worm in
the food."

You say in your story column
of Oct. 17 that the foodservice
officials did not believe Regina
when she told them that she
found a worm in her , food.
Again, you have failed to realize
that there are two sides to every
story. You have shut your eyes to
the management’s side. All stu-

‘Worm Story Doubted

service administrators run deep.

opportunity to express their side

"berg, is that someone in. your

dent matters must be questioned
as to their validity, no matter
how. sane or bizarre they sound
initially.

Contrary to your belief, Ms.
Hix was cordially invited to dis-
cuss her situation with Mr. Beav-
ers, which she did. On Monday,
Oct.l7, the two met, and what
resulted was an amicable deci-
sion. The decision was based on
the facts presented by both par-
ties. Mr. Beavers is afair andjust
man who bases his decisions on
concrete evidence from all sides
involved in a story. Maybe you
should try that just once.

Perhaps the alleged worm in
Regina Hix’s food came from
your “spilling the beans” before
the complete story was told.

(Editor’s Note: It seems
obvious that the suspicions of the
university's housing and food-

Those administrators, Jirn Beav-
ers, Ted Kaladas and Gil Kinder-
man,_ were given ample

of the Regina Hix story. What
does seem strange, Mr. Gold-

position did not know that the
Hix worm was just one of at least
three that were found during a
two-week period.)

Election I Committee’s

Codes Fair,

Dear Editor:

I would like to reply to both the
letter to the editor by Rodney
Dixon, and to the editorial which
appeared in the Oct. 17, 1983, issue
of The Pitt News. ‘

First, the editorial. In the editor-
ial, you state, “the election code is
probably difficult to read,” which to
me means that you have failed to do
what I have done — obtain a copy of
the code. Had you obtained a copy
of the code, you would have found
that the deficiencies you presented in
the editorial are covered clearly in
that code.

Oln the SGEC By-laws, Section I,
there appears a line which reads,
“Campaign Begins...Friday, Oct. 2!,
1983 ~ 8 a.m.” This line seems
pretty clear to me. Candidates are

responsible for all information in the '

campaign packet.

0Also in the By-laws, Section I;
“Orientation of Candidates...Mon-
day, Oct. l7, l983.” This allows the
candidates an opportunity to

I express their questions concerning

the elections process before the
beginning of the campaign. This

Readable

group orientation session allows the
SGEC the chance to answer all ques-
tions at one time to avoid duplicate
questions and save time.

It seems to me that the SGEC has

covered all the bases, which you ’

would have discovered had you
done your homework!

Second, the letter Mr. Dixon, last

‘year’s election was not run by the

code. There were violations of the
poll watchers (Article 1, Section 7),
poster policy (Article 2, Section I)
and others. The point is that the
code was not enforced last year,
which was why the action taken was
not as harsh. I cannot understand
why anyone would become upset
when we may have the election run
under the provisions of the code for
the first time in several years. The
code is structured to insure the “fair-
ness” of the election, fairness which
was jeopardized when Laura Elia-
son violated the provisions of the
code.

Stock Car Racing & Elections

By J.P. MARRA

Consider the following:

There’s this guy named Sam w_ho’s
entered in a stock car race. He lands
the post position in the qualifying
heats and lines up in front at the start
of the race. He sees the signal light
flash yellow and tromps the acceler-
ator. Naturally, he leaves the rest of
the pack behind, since they’re all
waiting for the green light, like
they’re supposed to.

_ Well, let’s suppose the race begins

on time, with Sam cruising out in

front. What can the steward do? He
has no choice-but to rush to Sam’s
pit crew and tell them to wave, the
driver in. Sam can’t believe it when
he sees his crew flashing cards
instructing him to pull in, but, being
an obedient driver, he does so. He is
then told that he started the race too
soon and must be disqualified. Sam
stares, slack-jawed, at the steward.

“What do you mean, I started the
race too soon?"

“You started on the yellow light,” '

the steward tells him. “You’re sup-
posed to wait for the green light."
« “But, I didn’t know that!” he
protests. ‘

What _can the steward do? Sure,

Sam didn’t know when he was sup- A

posed to start. But to allow him a

. head start simply because he was a

little ignorant would be unfair to the

other drivers, who took the time to
learn that they must wait for the
green before they can start.

#3!!!

I feel badly for Laura Eliason.

Were she to walk into my living .

room right now, I’d offer her a seat
and a beer and tell_ her stories about
being USG elections commissioner
at good ole Penn State.

 

One year a gerbil ran for office._

Wimpy the Gerbil finished second
that year. No kidding! Last year, one
candidate ‘pledged that were he
elected USG president, he would
begin a drive to raze Old Main and
install amissile silo, the better to
close PSU’s window of vulnerability
to the heathen Russkies. Being com-
missioner was no picnic at times,
believe me.

But I digress. The question to
answer is not, asisome would have it,

Dear Editor:

A recent article concerning the
Giant Eagle strike discussed
alternative supermarkets availa-
ble to Oaklandarea residents.
These alternatives were all out-
side the campus area.

Supermarkets are not the only
food stores, and they are not
always the cheapest. I buy most
of my food at the Semple Street
Food Co-op because it has excel-
lent fresh produce, cheeses and
milk, and its prices are usually
cheaper than those of my neigh-
borhood Giant Eagle.

SupermarketAIternatives

Even at non-member prices,
the co-op is a bargain. I have also
found that small grocery shops,
like Mancini’s on Atwood Ave.,
have good food at good prices. A
can of artichoke hearts that costs
$2.14 at the Giant Eagle in Squir-
rel Hill costs only $l. I9 at
Mancini’s.

The Pitt News did its readers a
disservice in failing to note that
alternatives to supermarkets are-
not necessarily other super-
markets.

“did Laura Eliason mean any
harm?”
It is the responsibility of an Amer-

ican citizen to know which of his .

potential actions are legal and which
are not. In the same way, the respon-
sibility of knowing the elections
code and understanding it falls upon
Laura Eliason and not the Elections
Committee, which acts only as an
enforcer of the code and administra-

tor of the election. The question we ‘

must grapple with is simply, “What's
fair, given the circumstances?"

*#I|I

Quick Quiz: Name anyone who’s

‘running or was going to run for

SGB. Ten points if you named
anyone besides Laura Eliason.
Minus five if you named only her. If

. we could tally up the scores of every-

one taking this quiz, we'd probably
get a big negative number. Whether
she meant to or not, hers is undoubt-
edly the most recognizable name of a
candidate running (or once running)
for board. Does that matter? Of
course, it does.

If name recognition meant
nothing, why bother with posters-in
the first place? That’s why they’re
there -— to make the name on that
poster a familiar one. And let's not
forget that by putting out posters l2

days before her competition, she was ’
‘ effectively “running the yellow light”

and gaining a head start on the oth-

ers that she could not giveback, even -

if she wanted to. The damage, as
they say, has been done. '

Now we return again to the ques-
tion at hand. What, indeed, is fair?
Laura Eliason, I am certain, did not
mean to violate the election code. In
retrospesct, we can say that she will
probably make sure she knows the
rules the next time she runs for an
office, be it social chairman of the
Wilmerding PTA or governor of
Pennsylvania. As she has learned, it
is her responsibility to do so.

However, given the circumstan-
ces, Jim Brady and the Elections
Committee passed down a brave and
correct decision. Given the influence
her actions and subsequent contro-
versy might have had on the out-
come of the election, they had no
other alternative.

Billy Idol, for example, received
two offers from PPC, but he has
postponed his tour from the middle
of October to January. Similar
problems occurred with The Motels

The PPC is paying Brenner
$12,000 for his performance, but
Holler said a comedian brings fewer
additional costs —— lighting and
sound for example — than a band
might. The committee is allowed to
spend up to $7,500 for the’perfor-
mance alone, but the additional
costs, including hospitality, can run
as high as $5,000. f

Holler said that ﬁnancial disaster L

has been set aside for‘a noon-
time screening’ of the UCIS
Media Series. The screenings will
take place in the UCIR confer-
ence room, G-20 Hillman
Library, at noon.

The schedule of presentations
is: Oct. 24, “Socialist Realism in
the U.S.S.R. and China”; Oct.
25, “Chinese Art After Mac";
Oct 26, “The Polish,Phoenix:
1000 Years of’ History and.,Cul-
ture”; and Oct. 27,-“Russian Civ-
ilization; Orthodoxy, Folklore
and’Social _.My,ths.” ' '

“Socialist. Realism’ _in the
U.S.S.vR. andr'China"vis a con-
temporary presentation of
socialist realism and its socio-
political function. Divided into
two parts, the first is concerned
with the direct application of art
in the service of revolutionary
politics. The second part deals
with the new social and cultural
values this an attempted to prop-
agate. As a valuable visual
representation of ideological
themes, “Socialist Realism” has

nism, ; international education,

history. .

“Chinese Art After Mac,” a
companion module to “Socialist
Realism,” offers evidence of the

. socio-political changes that have
occurred in the People’s Repub-
lic of China since 1976. Both pol-
itically and culturally, painting
has been one of the most interest-
ing areas in the arts in the P.R.C.
With the “thaw" in art and litera-
ture after 1976, new styles, sub-
jects and approaches were
opened up to the Chinese artist.
This change in mood is docu-

. mented in a presentation that
utilizes the artistic medium to
reflect those changes.

“Th_e Polish Phoenix” is the A

result of two ‘months of research
and 3,000 miles of travel inside
Poland, including visits to over
50 cultural institutions like the
National Museums of Warsaw,
Poznan, Krakow and Wroclaw.
To facilitate the project, the P01-

all photographic restrictions,
and many of Poland's most valu-

and antiquities —- some never
before photographed — were
brought out of safekeeping. The

part of that freedom is commun-

Scott said that local stations
should not follow the surveys to

Pitt DashesNavy Comeback Hopes 21-14  

‘ Moersh Photo

Fullback‘ Marc‘BalIey became the first Pitt rusher this season to
go over the 100-yard mark with 145 against Navy.

By CHARLIE O'HARA

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — “lt’s never
over till it’s over.” How many times
has that one been rehashed?

_ Here on Saturday, with a drive
starting at their own 20 and only
1:10 remaining in the fourth quarter,
Navy’s Midshipmen. trailing Pitt
2l-l4, decided it was not over, as
they marched 52 yards in 60 seconds.

It was reminiscent of the Penn
State last-second TD drive against
Nebraska last fall. This time, Navy
set up in fourth-down formation
from Pitt’s 28, with only 10 ticks
remaining.

With the 33,349 Navy fans in
hysterics, Midshipmen quarterback
Rick’ Williamson overthrew the
intended receiver, ﬂanker Greg
Brand, ending the hopes of an upset
over heavily favored Pitt. .

With four seconds left, Panther
quarterback John Congemi needed
only to fall on the football to

“I don’t know how many tackles
he broke. I was standing on the
sideline, and one play I watched him
break three or four tackles.”

For the Panthers, it is becoming
their trademark to get pushed
around during the first quarter or so
on defense, but Navy was able to do
so throughout.

“I was disappointed with our
intensity and our pursuit," Fazio

' said. “Missed tackles are a result ofa

lack of intensity and when you don’t
pursue. A good defense pursues and
stays in its lanes.

“Navy was beating us on the line
almost the entire second half. That’s
a lack of intensity.”

Though he wanted to make no
excuse, Fazio lashed out on the
officiating.

‘‘I’m sick and tired of sticking up
for officials,” he said. “[On the
touchdown pass from Congemi that
was called back for interference,
Dwight] Collins was pushed first.

- nine-play, .
culminating in a three-yard McCall ’

13:58 of the first quarter.  A

It took the Midshipmen 2:01 and.
five plays to march 31 yards.‘
Williamson hit Brand for a 13-yard

touchdown pass.
Pitt's first TD came on a
80-yard * drive,

touchdown run. ; ._ -
The big plays of thedrive also

came from the backfield.
Freshman tailback Chu'ck,S'cales

took a sweep to the right side for a’

17-yard gain. But Congemi’s screen
pass to fullback Marlon Mclntyre,

which went for 30 yards and set up-

first and goal from the three, put the
Panthers in range for McCall.

The Pitt 14-7 halftime lead could
easily have been a 14-14 tie if it were
not for a remarkable play by Pitt
cornerback Melvin Dean.

Navy had driven from its own
six-yard line to the Pitt 15, holding
the ball for 8:42 when it faced a
third-and-I0 situation.

Williamson handed off to

preserve the most hard-fought “lwhen C0n8€ml'5 P355 down the

Vietory of the 1933 season ~ sideline was ruled out-of-bounds, McCallum, who rushed for 41 yards

linebacker Troy Benson Said one penalty all day — an offsides.” Dean spotted the trickery and

afterward. “It was" a tough fight
inside, but we won.”

Entering the game,-the Panthers
believed that ’ if they could stop
All-America candidate tailback
Napoleon McCallum then the
Middies would be stymied.

Far from it; McCallum rambled
for 174 yards on 38 carries. In
addition, he accounted for 24 yards
receiving and returned a kickoff for
34 yards.

Obviously, he held the key to the
Navy success.

“We, played every one of our
defensive schemes,” Pitt head coach
Folge Fazio said. “I’m sure our guys
were keying on [McCallum], but he
has great lean, good balance, and he
heads for the goal line. He can play
for anybody in the country.

There were signs of brilliance,
though.

Fullback Marc Bailey rushed for
142 yards, including a pair of dashes
each for 45 yards.

Following a 14-yard punt return
by Tom Flynn with 1:13 remaining
in the first quarter, the Panthers had
a first down at their own 46 yard
line.

The Bailey 45-yard gain on first
down put Pitt at the Navy nine. On
fourth down, Congemi faked a
handoff to McCall and kept the ball
to run inside. At the last possible

second, he pitched to Bailey for the ‘

touchdown, his third ‘of the season.
The touchdown made it I4-7 Pitt.
Navy had opened the scoring on
the Middies’ first possession,
capitalizing on McCall’s fumble at

immediately made up the ground
between himself and the intended
receiver, tight end Keri Heine.
When the ball was thrown, Dean
had made up the lost ground and
intercepted it, ending the 79-yard‘

drive with :49 left in the half.

In the second half, the Panthers
showed they.can be a quick-strike
offense as well as an inconsistent
one. The latter was known about
beforehand.

After Navy took the second-half
kickoff and marched to the Pitt 44, it
punted 29 yards.‘ »

Scales went on a sweep to the righ ~ 
for nine yards on first down.

Mclntyre added three yards for a
first down at the Pitt 27. .
Then, Congemi, who completed
10 of 16 passes fo_r 175 yards,

Despite Incognito, 1
Mc Callum Thrives

By CHARLIE O'HARA

ANNAPOLIS, Md. —— One
would think that the NCAA’s
No. 1 ground gainer would be as
well known to sports fans as a
U.S. president. Then take a look

at Navy’s junior_ tailback, respected a defense against the
Napoleon McCallum, and see run as any in thecountry,at least
why generalizations are before the game.

da.T1geT0US- “Hefs got pretty good speed

After an afternoon frolic
against Pitt Saturday, though.
the mere mention of his name
evokes superstar images.

Although McCallum entered
Saturday’s contest leading the
nation in yards per game (157.7)
with 946 yards in. his first six
games, no one knew him, aside
from the opposition, who spent
long hours before the game
trying to figure out how to
contain him, conceding that they
cannot stop him.

“This week has been very
exciting," McCallum said. “All
of the press people have come to
see me play. There have been
radio and TV interviews, and
Sports Illustrated came to watch
today.

“I just wanted to play as well as

I could. There was so much extra.

incentive for this game. There
was added pressure, too."
If there was added pressure,

38 carries for 174 yards onthe
day.

Maybe not so hard to believe if
the opponent were of the caliber
of Princeton, against whom he
gained 229 yards last week. But . I
this was Pitt, who had as highly »

and a great deal of power,” said
Pitt linebacker Caesar Aldisert
following the game (Napoleon v.
Caesar; how fitting). “He knew
how to read his blocks very well.
He's probably as good as any
running back I’ve played
against.”

“He’s as good, if not better
than, any running back that I’ve
faced,” agreed four-year starting
safety Torn Flynn. Flynnghas
faced Herschel Walker, Kelvin
Bryant, Eric Dickerson and Curt
Warner, among others. That
itself is good company.

The difference, though, is that
those others played on excellent
teams. McCallum‘s squad is 2-5,
with the Middies’ only victories
coming against such teams as
Princeton and Lehigh.

So how is it that McCallum is
able to gain over 150 yards per
game against a schedule that

A “For Pitt, I really didn’t get to -
see much film because I had
finals this week,” McCallum
said. “They didn't really have any
flaws, though. There were times
when we would run a sweep with
me. There was supposed tobe a
seam there; instead there were

I three or four Pitt guys.
Sometimes they missed me and
sometimes they didn’t."

“I don’t know how many
tackles he broke,” said Pitt head -
coach Foge Fazio, “but he has
great lean, good balance, and he
heads for the goalline. He can

, play for anybody in the country.”

Navy coach "Gary Tranquill
expressed similar sentiments.

“If you rate running backs on '
productivity, Nap [McCallum] ..
has got to be one of the best,
because there ain't nobodyany.

- more productive than he is.”

He would be‘. a Heisman. .

He said that becoming a pilot
for the Navy or Marines is first

goals, but if the interest is still
there after five years, he would
like to try his hand at
professional football.

This. week the Midshipmen
face Notre Dame at South Bend.
The Irish are coming off an
impressive victory over Southern

Mark Mazzlottl (2) and Matt Becker (15) take the ball Into Wesleyan territory Saturday.

By TIM DINGER

“A tie leaves us sort of blah; but
we played a very good game, and we
came from behind.”

It was enough to leave the Pitt
soccer team in limbo, head coach
Leo Bemis could have added to that
statement after the Panthers tied
West Virginia Wesleyan [-1 in dou-
ble overtime at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday. ‘ .

“We kept after them,” Bemis said,
“We had to hold the game down
because we knew they were a very
skillful team.”

The tie moves Pitt’s record to 7-8-
l, while Wesleyan, nationally-
ranked (fifth) in NAIA play, goes to
8-4-2.

According to Bemis, it was
defense that kept Wesleyan in the
game, while offensively, the lack ofa
strong shooter kept the Panthers
from scoring the much-needed goal
in overtime.

T “Our defense played very well
against a very strong, attacking

team,” Bemis said. “All of the fel-
lows played well; they kept good
movement at times and created
shots.

“If we had a stronger shooter, we “TA

could have scored, but wejust don’t
have one. Nick Wilson played one of
his best games ofthe season, and our
goalie Dave Torrence kept us in the
game, making a lot of saves, espe-
cially in the first half.”

The only goal scored for the
Panthers came from freshman Rick
Godfrey on an assist by sophomore
Rich Burkholder, with just over 24
minutes remaining in the second
half.

Wesleyan’s only goal came mid-
way through the first half.

important West Penn Conference
match on Tuesday at Geneva. The
Panthers are currently 4-1 in confer-
ence play and are fighting for supre-
macy in Division II. .
Geneva beat Pitt last year 1-0, but
the outco_me_ of t6morrow’s game
could depend heavily on the
weather. A -

“Their field is very muddy and /
hard toplay on after a rain,” Bemis 

said. “If the weather is bad, we may

" have to play on their football field. If

that happens, we’ll have to play very -

strong defense because of the

smaller field; it is very conﬁning.
“One mistake and you’ve got the

‘ball in our goalie’s face. It’ really

tightens up the game.” »
Both teams have been relatively

even against common opponents,

Bemis remarked. .

‘.‘We expected it to be a very close 5“-

game,” he said. “We’re going to have
to go down there and want it more

‘ than they do.”

Also adding weight to tomorrow’s
match isia Pitt squad hoping to get a
berth in the Big East Top Four
Tournament. The team has to, at the
very least,~end the season about .500,
Bemis said, and beat Villanova this
Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia.

Said Bemis, “There are a couple of
teams in the Big East that are strug-
gling for even records. If we can win

these next two games, then we have a if.

good chance of having a winning
record, which could-get us into the
tournament."

unleashed a_ 34-yard sideline pass to
split end Bill Wallace, putting Pitt at
the Navy 39. On the next play,
Congemi again went long to
Wallace, this time for a TD. At that
point, it was 21-7.

“I had a feeling I was going to
catch a touchdown today,” Wallace

."‘ysaid. “It was great to finally catch
some long ones.

“John [Congemi] did a great job.
He’s getting better each week, and I
think we're running better routes.
We still had some plays called back,
but I think we’re getting there.”

Following ‘a 34-yard kickoff
return by (who else?) McCallum,
looking as if he were going to break
it open for a touchdown, Pitt held
Navy on four downs.

From its own 20, Pitt took over.
On the first play, Congemi, for a
third straight time, went to Wallace.

‘TA 34-yard reception that appeared
to be in bounds was ruled out.

“It was bad call,’’ Wallace said.
“So was the call against Dwight
[Collins] earlier. It was the same
play that they called me out on
against Maryland.”

“Bill [Wallace] was getting open
all day,” Congemi said. “We made
some big plays today — that was

The Panthers held Navy on four
plays and it looked like the walls
were‘ caving in.

On Pitt's first play, Bailey
scampered 45 yards to the Navy 25.
On the strength of a Mclntyre
four-yard gain, Pitt had first down
at the 12.

But then, the Middies’ defense
tightened. On fourth-and-ﬁve from
the seven, placekicker Eric Schubert
missed a 24-yard ﬁeld goal,
disgusting Fazio and giving one last
breath of life to Navy.

“We’re going to take a long look
at the placekicker [Schubert],”
Fazio said. “We can’t afford to get
that far down the field and miss."

The game would have been locked

Eastern independent
football teams can make a nuclear
phy'sicist‘s head spin. ,

Penn State whipped West
Virginia 4l-23 for the 28th
consecutive time on Saturday, right?
And West Virginia earlier defeated
Boston College and Pitt, OK? Penn
State plays BC this weekend,
comprende? Pitt has yet to play
Penn State. That‘s obvious.

And even though Penn State is
currently riding a five-game winning
streak, »what to make of its three
opening losses in succession? If the
Lions swallow Pitt Nov. 19, is it
rational to call them worthy of the
Lambert Trophy? — awarded to the
East’s most deserving team.

. What a way to tax the brain. If
Penn State defeats both the Eagles
and-the Panthers, then give the thing
to the Nits. Supposing Joe Paterno
loses both. games, not entirely
inconceivable, then toss a coin
between‘Pitt and West Virginia.

the Lambert in half.

Pitt has no chance at it, save fora
victory over the Nittany Lions.

Olt is easy to see why Rick
Telander, writer for Sports
Illustrated, called here last week. He
is currently attempting to find an
answer to whether today's society
(are we still civilized?) places too
much importance on
athletics.

For simplicity, it is really a
question preceded by football and
basketball.

Telander wanted some insight
into former Pitt linebacker Todd
Becker’s death last year in addition
to off-the-top-of-the-head
comments on the state of today’s
collegiate athletics.

For added simplicity, Telander

need not look any farther than’

tailback Marcus Dupree. Withithe
Oklahoma Sooners until l0 days
ago, Dupree, for reasons unknown
to those who cannot tap into
Dupree’s emotional bank,
transferred to Southern Mississippi.

Dupree was “caught” between
that school and Mississippi State.
He picked the latter after
discovering that future schedules
and the players on the team seemed
to his liking. Is there‘ any guess as to

pwhat Dupree thought of the new

academic program? .

every persuasion in the world to

force the reader to buy a
subscription. . ‘
Not only must the reader

interrupt a reading train of thought
to rip the things out, but the cards
also fall out once they are
haphazardly placed in the magazine.

Bending over to pick the trash up
(to inﬂict a slipped disc) aside, why
would a regular subscriber want to
resubscribe? Home subscribers are
mercilessly bombarded with these
inserts every time.

And everyone thought the B-1
Bomber or Jerry Falwell were
contemporary dilemmas.

OAfter rambling over to the
know-it-all grapevine recently, an
interesting prophecy could be
discerned. Look to see city sports
columnist Bob Smizik once again
transfer his allegiance.

Smizik, "formerly of The
Pittsburgh Press, took ‘ his
“hard-hitting style” to the

Pittsburgh Post- Gazette when the
leaves started ' turning brown this
summer. -Now Smizik is being lured
back to the Press and will likely ﬂash

With money the bait the first time
he’ took a walk and very likely -the
same motivator this time, score this

CDO not despair. Only 15 mere
weeks remain before Sports

0Bowl bidding should start
heating up very shortly. As far as
Pitt is concerned, the Panthers are
presently being looked upon in an
accommodating light.

That, at least, by the Fiesta Bowl
committee. Tom Fridena,
vice-president, watched Pitt play
Navy over the weekend. It was not
the first time, and for good reason.
The Fiesta people are attracted to
Eastern TV markets like fire‘ to a

A ‘ haystack.

“Pitt is always an exciting ball
club,” Fridena said. “A lot of people
in Arizona are from Pittsburgh and
Pennsylvania.” If the Panthers, as
well as a school desired from the
West Coast, get the nod for the
bowl’s l3th playing on New Year‘s
Day, the reaction will bring

Interestingly, the earliest any

the same day Penn State steps foot
