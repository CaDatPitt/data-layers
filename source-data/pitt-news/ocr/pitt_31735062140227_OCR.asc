Removed From Game.

Last ‘Friday evening the second game
of the City Collegiate basketball series
was played in the ﬁeldhouse of Car-
negie Technical Schools with the Uni-
versity ﬁve a loser by a score of 30 to
20. The Tech team was in excellent

form and had no trouble covering our ,

forwards, who seemed unable to devel-
op their usual speed. The crowd assem-
bled to witness the game was the lar-gest
in the history of the Tech gymnasium.

The home team started with a rush
and were soon in the lead, retaining

fthe commanding position until the close

of the half, when the score stood l2 to
7. In the second half Pitt displayed a
more aggressive spirit and made a des-
perate attempt to cut down that Skibo
lead, but their efforts were in vain.
Kelly and J. Williams, for Tech,
played the best game, while Farmer did
creditable work for the University.
Captain VVeger and McDowel of Tech

A were removed from the game by Ref-

eree‘ Flint on account of unnecessary
roughness. The lineup:

1; The Day of Prayer observed in all
,colleges and universities throughout the
lworld was ﬁttingly observed last Thurs-
!day in chapel. Chapel was thronged to
!its capacity by students from all depart-
,‘ments,of the University. The most in-
lteresting and helpful feature of the
lmorning"s exercises was the eloquent ad-
ldress by Mr. J. VV. Lewis, general sec-
‘aretary of the Yours‘ Men’s Christian
{Association of Cleveland. His subject
iwas “The. Student Impact” and in a most
convincing and forceful manner did he
show how the student had ﬁgured in the
onward march of civilization. After
showing how important a factor had
been the “Student Impact” in Africa and
theplace that Alexandrine learning had
in the history of the dark continent;

the great center of Byzantium with all
its civilization; then passing through the
historical reminiscence of scholastic
Europe he bruoght before our minds
the fact that the line of institutions
of learning that formed themselves
from Vermont to Georgia had played
a most important part in the conquest
of our own great continent.

Having previous-ly served on the In-
ternational Committee of the‘ Young
Men’s Christian Association and being
perfectly familiar with the actual work
of the student volunteers in all the for-
eign heathen countries of the globe, he
emphasized the importance of the Stu-
dent Impact of the present inthe fu-
ture progress of Christian civilization.

tioned the fact that the government is
recognizing its responsibility toward the
“less—favored’l’ nations of the world and
the practical part of the work falls up-
on the college men of today.

Let us hope that the students of the

.University will take cognizance of this

great movement of Student Volunteers.
"It is one’ of the forces that is moving
the, world and they should be. in full
sympathy and full touch with it.

MEET PITTSBURGH NEXT FALL

Rumors of Past Month Are Set
Aside by Notice Appearing in
Old Penn--Schedule Said to he
Finally Filled. ’

Athletic Committee Places
Stamp of Approval Upon
Schedule Already Arranged-
Disappointment to Friends of
Both Universities.

The University of Pittsburgh will not
meet the University of Pennsylvania on

the gridiron next fall. According to the '

ofﬁcial magazine of the University,
Penn's schedule is already ﬁlled and
awaits the ratiﬁcation of the athletic
committee. It is understood that the au-
thorities at Penn sent Graduate Mana-
ger Hurst a ﬁnal declaration of their
plans last week, in which it was deﬁnite-
ly stated that the meeting of Penn and

Pitt would not occur this coming sea-M

S011.

The occasion of such a game would

have aroused a great deal of interest in-
football in the Keystone State and the

failure of the scheduling of the ,con—=L

test is a keen disappointment in.Phila—

The following clipped from the cur-
rent number of Old Penn, the Univer-
sity magazine, may prove of interest to
the students:

“There will be but one new opponent
on Pennsylvania's football schedule this
fall. This will be Syracuse, whose team
makes its ﬁrst appearance on Franklin
Field. The exact date on which Syra
cuse will play has not been deﬁnitely de-I
cided,,but in all probability it‘ will be
October 28. . ‘

“The publication of the dates puts to

rest the many rumors aﬂoat of late, to ,
the effect that Pennsylvania intended to _

play Pittsburgh or Chicago. 130th of
these teams would be worthy oppm.ien:'.gs,
but there is at present no room for them
on the sche(lule.jThere will be but one
game played away from Franklin Fieldf

That willpbe played with Michigan at

Ann Arbor, on November 18."

“The football committee has not made
any announcement concerning the coach-
ing staff for 1911, but it is not likely

that there will be any important changes.

The tentative schedule for 1911, which
is yet to be approved by the University
Athletic Committee, is as follows:
“September 23——Gettysburg at Frank
lin Field.
“September 27—Ursinus at Frank".in

Forensic Debaters Argue the
Feasibility of Compulsory
Chapel at Regular Meeting
Last Evening.

The Pitt Forensic Society is grad—l.

ually becoming stronger. This fact is
shown not only by the increased atten.
(lance at the nieetings but also by the
increasing excellence of the programs
rendered and by the increase of inter-
est shown by the audience.

At the meeting on Tuesday evening,
February 7th, the subject for debate,
the income tax, was the same as that to
be debated with Allegheny and VVooster
colleges this year. The debate was very
spirited and close and the interest of the
audience was noteworthy. The judges
decided in favor of the affirmative side.

Immediately following the program a
business_ session was held. The‘ chief
matters brought up were the debate with
Notre Dame and the report of the com-
mittee appointed to revise the constitu-
tion. The advisability of a debate with
Notre Dame was left, to a committee
of three, whose decision will be at.
nounced in a short time. The constitu-
tion, as now adopted, provides for a
meeting every week on Tuesday even-
ing. Remember this, every Tuesday
evening, and come out for the Forensic
Society.

f  ’ THE'LEADEiR’S CHANCE.
A Last week Chancellor’ McCormick de-

the attendance at chapel exercises and
in_ v.ery emphatic term.s requested the_
students to take upon themselves the
obligation of arousing more enthusiasm.
Certainly the devotional hour is being
neglected in a manner most‘ discourag-
ing to the faculty committee, whose

 duty has been the selection of chapel.
 speakers.’ The recent number of men
V heard in the assembly room has been of

‘such high calibre, that ‘many lecture
courses do not compare favorably with

to the students of the -University. The
reasons in favor of presence. at chapel
are numerous, but the question upper-
most in the mind is, to get the men
there. The suggestion of /compulsory
methods will not meet the issue fairly

of ‘religious affairs. The logical means

idents of thetstudent organizations, who
class oﬂicers, the student senators and
all those at the head of any student ac-
tivity, to be present every day that it is
possible to do so and not resort to urg-
ing the other fellow. This idea seems the
must.-.. reasonable. to .the lover of fair

be the means of increasing the chapel
services in the University.’ ‘

TOO SMALL.

Coach Joseph Thompson was pres-
ent lat chap.el services one day last
week and delivered a stirring address
to the students. During his talk the
statement was made that the new
athletic ﬁeld-will be barely sufficient
to meet the demands of the Varsity
football team, when actual practice is
begun, the allegation being based on

Mr. Thompson stated that
the second team will scarcely be able

tended. No other authority than the; place of convocation. ‘The result of: . . .
declaration, in the E the change was an audience, from the 1 Head of Umvers1ty‘Engl1sh Depart-

coach’s simple
course of the speech last week, is
available to baseirany criticism, but

if such is the real aspect of the situa—§

tion, we earnestly hope the athletic
committee will not permit the future
career of University athletics to '-be
blighted by the lack of space. It is

gunderstood that the adjacent ground
" is ‘being reserved for a dormitory—-

we need that dormitory, we need a.

chapel, all that, and more, but how
the completeness of the new stadium

can be sacriﬁced for artistic principles
is quite beyond our comprehension.
The University of‘ Pittsburgh has
done little for the students in the
way of recreation, as Mr. Thompson
mentioned, and now in the face ofian
unparalleled opportunity to aid the
physical condition of the students the
had of limitation is already evident.
The students are entitled to their full
share of Mr. Trees’ generous dona-
tion and if an attempt is made to
crowd the stadium, in order that it
will ﬁtintoa niche of the group plan
—-well, we can dispense with the pro-
fessors’ dormitory for a few months!

 

FORMS POOR EXCUSE.

A speaker, appearing in chapel last
week, is responsible for the declaration
that the present‘ system of education is
wrong because it places, marks above
per_sonal ability and efﬁciency. Just at
the outset the statement appears to be

pr gnent with truth, but a careful ana- .

lysis disproves much of the original
strength'of the argument advanced in
support of the hypothesis. It is granted
thatthe man who ﬁnishes at the head.
of a graduating class is not always the
leader inafter life and, that the old
habits ofgrind formed in college days
are not easily disposed of when the

A LOST CHANCE.

At a meeting of the athletic com-
mittee of the University last week it
was decided not to send a relay team
to the annual games at Philadelphia
this coming springil The Weekly
does not feel inclined to doubt the
wisdom or choice of the athletic au-
thorities, but in view of the circum-
stances it seems only fair to the stu-
dents to suggest a careful considera-
ation of the case before taking such
drastic action. The Philadelphia
trip is the most important incentive
offered t-o the track men, not alone
is it a beneﬁt to the athletes them-
selves, but it ands considerable pres-
tige to the name of the University of
Pittsburgh by the mere fact. of rep-
resentation. It is not intended to
‘ stir" up anygharsh criticism over the
idecision of the committee, ‘but it is
lhoped that. further thought will be
given the Philadelphia meet. ,

speaker. It is the man who has ah.lit,v}

does not believe entirely in his ~.>o3k,i

POOR ‘SHOWING.

The men of the dental, pharmacy"
and medical schools made a splendid
showing in the way of attendance at
the -day of prayer, services last Thurs-
day. The representation from the col-
lege, engineering, mining, economic
and education schools was really dis-
-graceful.‘ For the convenience of the
students t-he exercises were arranged
for the assembly room in Tha-lw Hall,

Penn has saved itself a defeatl The
University of Pittsburgh is not to
meet the Red and Blue this year.

 

Most likely those University hockey

players who appeared in Cleveland,

said, “Oh, shinny.” _ i _

A party of University students vis-
ited the penitentiary last week. They
went to scoff, but no one remained
to pray.

DEBATE, CHAPEL QUESTION.
Forensic Debaters Argue the Feasi-
bility of Compulsory Chapel at
‘Regular Meeting Last Evening

tThe Forensic Society met last night
in [the assembly room- of Thaw Hall,
with a spirited debate as the chief at"-
traction of the evening. The subject of
the argument was: Resolved, that com-
pulsory chapel is necessary in theV':l’12i-
versity of Pittsburgh. An oration by
Zellers Luther _’l2, was an added en-
joyment of the program. _

The matter of the debate with N rrc
Dame was taken up and discussed. '\r-
cher and Laun were the aﬁirmative side
of the debate, while Neeson and Coen
defended the negative.

THE FORENSIC SOCIETY.

Some weeks ago in one of the issues
of your paper there appeared an article
about the Forensic Society in which one
of the members urged the students to
loin the society. He wondered at their
seeming indifference toward such a no-
ble purpose. The fault does not lie with

_the students, but with the society itself.
~ At a meeting three weeks ago a motion

was passed by a majority of those pres-
ent.-—the motion was that every student
not present at that meeting, who was
previously a member of the society, be
expelled. Such a motion is nothing but
suicidal in its character——-a prep. school

stunt. The idea of the majority of “the

fifteen” who gathered together that
evening must have been to make it an
exclusive body and an exceedingly au-
tocratic one._ It is they, who are ‘bound
to represent the University in the inter-
collegiate debate. They no doubt will
succeed if by one motion they indirectly
eliminate from competition forty-ﬁve,
who signiﬁed their intention of forming
the society when it was ﬁrst organized.

Such conditions in a society that as-
sociates itself with the name of the
University of Pittsburgh are deplorable.
The majority of the members seemed
to be possessed of a demagogical “Gee
I’m It” spirit, wholly uncharacteristic

of other university organizations.

AN OBSERVER.

\.j_.:.

WHERE’S THE CHEER-LEADER

Three of the scheduled basketball
games have been played thus far. As yet
we have had no concerted cheering.
This fact is not due to lack of studen_ts
attending the games nor to lack of
willingness on their part to root, but
to the absence of the cheer leader. Away
in the back of our heads is a faint recol-
lection of having elected a cheer leader
—we‘ almost forced the ofﬁce on him,
and thereby got into a controversy with
the Medical students, thelatter claiming
that they were not repr-esented in the
election nor permitted to have a voice in
the matter. At the time the Medical
students raised their howl, we thought
possibly they were not "‘in "the know”
and- that we knew a real live cheer-
leader when we saw one, and hence
“forced” the ofﬁce on Mr. Kirk. Mr.
Kirk’s absence-from the games (or
his failure to arrange for a suitable
substitute during his absences), has not
only been bad for the team and for the
University "also, but it is showing the
student body of the Collegiate and En-
gineering Departments up as far as the
Medical students are concerned. We
have honored the man, now let the man
honor us. To repeat, VVhere is the Cheer
Leader? CHEER UP.

A SUGGESTION; NOT A KNOCK.t

I think statistics will show that less
than ﬁfty per cent of the students do
not participate in elections for various
offices ‘in the school. A great majority

of these students either have not been

WILL NOT COACH TEAM.

Coach Joe Thompson Will Not Have
Direct Charge of Track Team.

In his tal-k to the students last Wed-
nesday morning Coach Joe Thompson
made the remark that he would not be
directly in charge of the coaching of the
track team this spring, but that he ex-
pected to help out whenever he could
and keep in touch with the team. Joe is
a good track team coach and it was
good to know that he would at least
lend his assistance in coaching the
team. He is very enthusiastic over track
athletics and isanxious that all students
get out for the team.“

Is The Best

Professor -Rudolph Tombo of

Columbia Makes Interesting
Comment on German Students

-Think Americans Rich Men.

Prof. Rudolph Tombo, sent by Colum-
bia University as exchange professor ‘in
Berlin, has returned to America with
his faith in American university life and
its superiority undisturbed.

“The German student isn’t asihealthyi

looking, or as soun-d as the American
college man,” says Prof. Tombo. “He
has few opportunities for exercise and
little chance at healthy sports. In the

matter of college spirit,_the German is A

far behind the American. student. Partly
the fault lies with the German system
of "education. From his ninth to his
eighteenth year the boy attends a ‘gym-
nasium.’ The miscellaneous a.ges there
and the later habit of spending a sem-
ester or two at different universities
spoil the chance of getting any real
college spirit.

' “They have absolutely no use for ‘co-
eds’ and whenever I referred _to the
higher education of w-omen they‘ex-
pressed disapproval by shuffling their
teet. VV-hen I mentioned that no womai.
could study, law at Columbia they
stamped with enthusiasm.

“German students are much interested-

in everything American, but they con-
sider our tuition fees extortionate. Many
would study in this country were it not
for the expense. ‘Your students must
all be rich men,’ said one of my hearers
in Berlin. I told him that on the con-
trary most of them were comparatively
poor, but he could not understand.”

I MORROW ACCEPTS JOB.

Former Coach Assumes Double Re-
sponsibility at W. and J. College.

Last week David C. Morrow ac-
cepted‘ the position of "manager-coach
at Washington and Jefferson College.
Following almost immediately his
acceptance of the position came t-he
announcement from the new official
that VV. and J and Pitt would meet
on the “gridiron as usual next fall.
This game is to be played in: Pitts-
burgh on a date corresponding to
that on which the struggle took place
in 1910. '

An innovation ‘inii. connection with
the regular gymnasium calisthenic ex-
ercises at ‘Syracuse will be tried out
for the first time’ this year. It has
been planned to have classes in row-
ing and sculling start November 1st.
Coach James A. TenEyck will have
charge of the work and handle about
four eights a day. The classes will
meet shortly after the gymnasium
hour has begun.

The subject offered this year to
the students of Stanford University

in the Bohemian contest is: H“The

following to say:
