Students have a chance today to display that school
spirit which was the ‘incentive,’ according to Lou (Bimbo)
Cecconi, for last Saturday’s victory. A pre-game rally
fourth hour at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall provides
the opportunity.

Classes have been officially dismissed fourth hour for
the rally.

Dave Fox, Student Congress assemblies chairman, will
introduce Chester L. (Chet) Smith, sports editor of the Pitts-
burgh Press, who will take over the microphone as master

, of ceremonies.

Featured speaker will be Percy D. Horton III. Mr.
llorton, famous alumnus of Ohio State University, is honor-
ed in football annals as being responsible for there being
seven cleats on the player’s shoe. Previous to his innova-
tion the shoes had only five cleats, according to confiden-

tial sources.

This is the first time that Mr. Horton has been able to
attend the Pitt-Ohio State game, at least as an alumnus.
In 1921 he was immortalized when, as water boy for the
Buckeyes, he spilled a large pool of water near the defen-
ders’ goal, causing the Panther fullback to slip and fumble
the ball during a crucial play. The fumble cost Pitt the
game, their only loss of the season.

At least, that’s what an advance press release says.

Emcee Smith will introduce Tom Hamilton, athletics
director; Mike Milligan, team coach; and Cecconi, team
captain. These three personages brought thunderous ova-
tions from the student crowd at last Monday’s rally. They
will share the speaking honors with Mr. Horton.

On hand will be the Pitt Varsity Marching Band, which
has received favorable comment for performances throughout

‘Classes Freed*for.4th-Hour Rally

the year‘, and the cheerleaders to lead the expected 3000
turnout through the paces of ‘Alleghenee’ and the ‘Divided
Yell.’ The spirited Panther will be present with his antics.

Tentative plans also include three girls from the senior
class in a singing parody on Ohio State.

This is the first of two pre-game rallies to «be held the
rest of this season. The next rally will be held Nov. 18
before the Penn State game.

Anticipating a victory this Saturday, the’ assemblies com
mittee is planning a victory rally to follow immediately
after the game. Plans are being made to include a victory
march from the Stadium to the Bigelow Boulevard court of
the Cathedral, where local sports broadcasters will emcee

the affair. _
Debora Hall, the fraternity houses and most of the sor-

ority houses are going all out for the weekend with signs
and banners over the buildings urging, "Beat Ohio State.”

Pitt Spotted 13

When they trot out onto the Sta-
dium sod tomorrow, the Ohioians
will be favored to win by 13 points.

The Panthers, who have earned
a reputation for playing their best
ball when figured to be on the short
end of the final score, have hopes
of coming away from the fray with-
out getting their whiskers singed.

This sentiment is not shared by
most experts. As onemember of the
of ‘-the sportshirt set put it, ‘Pitt
will wish that the immigration quota
was filled when the Savics and little
Pandel applied for admission to the
States. Savic will pass ’em to death."

Heavy Passing Expected

Quarterback Pandel Savic, Buck-
eye passing ace, came to this coun-
try from Yugoslavia when he was
10 years old.

Ohio State falls back on Savic’s
passing ability to gain yardage
when their ground game is stalled.
Incidentally, if Pitt’s line play is
up to usual standards tomorrow, this

should happen often.

Savic, who is known to his team-
mates as Panhandle, also has a
reputation in the Big Ten as a
blocker. For this reason, when he
isn’t throwing a pass, he’s throwing
a block.

I Lots of Backs

Halfbacks Jimmy Clark and Jerry
Krall also toss a few passes to
give the Scarlet and Gray a triple-
pronged aerial attack. On the re-
ceiving endofmost of these passes
will be Ray Hamilton, speedy half-
back who was a sprinter and hurdler

ing in addition to the kicking.

Up front, the Scarlet and Gray is
two deep in veterans. Outstanding
linemen are Capt. Jack Wilson, a
tackle, and End Jimmy Hague. Hague
does the Ohio State point-after-touclr
down kicking.

OSU Dropped One

Thus far, the Fesler machine,
which uses both the T and single
wing formations, has scored 139
points to win four games, tie one,
and lose one. Ohio State’s only
loss was to Minnesota, 27-0, three
weeks ago.

School and Alumni Prepared

For Homecoming Weekend

One of Pitt's biggest homecoming
celebrations will begin tonight as
members of the Varsity Letter Club
gather in the Webster Hall Hotel
for their annual dinner.

About ninety alum lettermen will
attend the pre-game event. Woody
Wolfe_ and Bill Sutherland, who
broadcast the Pitt football games,
will give short talks.

The program for the evening, as
planned by chairman Dr. Homer
Butts, will include the presenta-
tion of achievement cups to out-
standing performers of 1948-49.

Awards for basketball will go to
Sammy David and Dodo Canterna;
swimming, Dick Petro; track, Clar-
ence Doak, and for baseball to
Jack Snyder.

These men were chosen for the

awards by their team members and
a poll taken by the Owl staff.
Many Celebrities

Among the outstanding lettermen
attending will be Bert Smyers, a
member of the first Pitt football
team; Tom Hamilton, athletic di-
rector; Roy McKenna, alumni trustee
of the University, and William Kern,
former Pitt coach and head of all
homecoming events.

The next big event in the week-
end celebration will be the alumni
buffet luncheon in the Hotel Schen-
ley on Saturday morning from 11 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m. Tickets were sold out
two weeks ago for the luncheon.

Plans were set in motion in
September for the luncheon by Mr.
Kern and a committee chosen from
Alumni Council.

Mr. Kern, who graduated in 1927
from Pitt's School of Business
Administration, has since coached
for Pitt, Carnegie Tech and the
University of West Virginia.

550 For Luncheon

Over 550 alumni will be enter-
tained amid blue and gold banners
and pennants at the luncheon.
They'll each wear a cartoon name-
tag designed especially for the
luncheon by Cy Hungerford, Pitts-
burgh’s Pulitzer Prize cartoonist.

The Panther (Dario “Ike” Icardi)
himself will roar and scamper as a
cheerleader works to increase
enthusiasm before game time.

tainer for alumni affairs, and an
alum himself, will play with two

Our Homecoming Role

The elaborate preparations the alumni office is making for
_ if . Homecoming apparently are leaving the student body cold. Ob-
viously, the activities leading up and including the Ohio State
game Saturday afternoon are designed for "old grad” consump-
tion, intended to keep them in friendly touch with their alma mater
each year. ”
._ Should it mean anything to the present clan of Pitt men and
women? To find out, we dispatched our inquiring reporter, Betty
McGuire, to sample the opinion of the undergraduate population.
The students she questioned, however, either didn’t know enough
‘or care enough about the subject to comment. So that query was
junked.
,/All the more determined to find out what Homecoming should
8 mean to Joe Pitt,1949, we put the question to’ J. Clyde Barton,
the alumni secretary.

"The student never will quite appreciate Homecoming until

_ he’s been out.\ of school 25 years, has half his years behind him,

. then returns to the alma mater for Homecoming.” Mr. Barton ex-
plained. "As for the student, his job should be making the alumni
welcome when they arrive this weekend. He should roll out the
red rug for them. He’ll appreciate a similar welcome when he
comes back as an alumnus,”

That sort of dumps the student in the back seat. Sure he can
pick up a conversation with some alumnus wandering through the
Cathedral, point out sights of interest, etc. That’s what the
directors of the activities want him to do. He doesn’t really get

, into the swing of things. He just looks on, with no particular
 interest, because there’s nothing that particularly appeals to him.
 Now, if we had something coming along, like the Dad’s days
that come up during football -season in Midwestern schools, the
student would be’ more closely integrated into the program. He
would take it on his own shoulders to see that his old man enjoys
his visit and decides that his investment in the education of his
son or daughter is worthwhile. V
‘Those older men and women who will crowd into Oakland to-
day and tomorrow (Mr. Barton tells us of the sellout for today's
luncheon and the enthusiastic reception Homecoming has received
among the alumni) will in most cases be no Pitt student’s dad or
mother. These visitors are bound to us only by the University.
Nonetheless, it won’t hurt us to do our little share, if only
to safeguard ourselves against Mr. Barton’s prophecy into our

Mcouire

own futures.

One of the most popular topics of
conversation seems to be the un-
P°Pu1ar quality and price of the
coffee served in the Tuck Shops.
In order to find out if it'ivs as bad
as some claim,we interviewed some
University coffee drinkers. For that
reason, this space is filled with
opinions of the current eight cent
brand.

Virginia Fansler, Bus. Ad. ’50:
‘It’s not even worth a nickel.’

Kenneth Lowman. College ’51:
‘It costs too much, but it is good
coffee. I think it’s the cream that
makes that green scum on top.’

Marty Schrarnm, Mine '53: ‘We
might as well drink the coal tar up
at school. That coffee is only hot
water with cream until around 4:30
p.m. then it's all grounds. Turkish
coffee is bad, but Tuck Shop coffee
is enough to kill a Turk.’

' Doris Moses, College ’S0: ‘It's
outrageous--the coffee and the price.

Charles Suchma, Engineering ’51:
‘Tastes like lye.’

Claire Large, Education ’S0:
never drink it.’

James Snyder, Bus Ad. '50: ‘If
they would refrain from putting var-
nish init, the coffee might be O.K.’

Ann Rogers, Nursing ’50: ‘I've
been from Houtzdale to Yokahoma
and l’ve never tasted anything like
it—for eight cents too.’

Dolores Blake, Education '51: ‘I
don't think the coffee is so bad. It
is a little weak, but other than that,
I think it’s good.’

Elin Lando, College ’SO: ‘It was
sensationaltoday. I hadthree cups,
but sometimes it’s like unstrained
mud.’

James Maloney, Bus Ad. ’S0:
"1 here was a shortage of good cof-
fee in the Tuck Shop long bef0Ie
the shortage in Brazil.’

Gerry Pendrp, College ’S1: ‘The
coffee tastes better this year, but
I still think that eight cents is too
much.’

Nancy Little, Pharmacy '52:
‘Some of my Pharmacy lab experi-
ments taste better than that.’

Hannah Stanton, Pre Nursing ’54=
‘They ought to warn freshmen in
the bulletins.’

Ed Bennett, Engineering ’503 ‘I
think it's the most atrocious stuff
on the face of the earth.’

'aker’s Dozen 

 

Students have been verbally
walks, and orientation classes,

swiping at the dinks, restricted
the three main points of Men’s

Council’s revitalized freshman program, from the Tuck Shop to

the columns of the Pitt News.
other side.

Let’s take a quick look at the

A trial was held some ten days
ago. This court not only heard of
of the misadventures of one fresh-
man, but unconsciously identified
the underlying idea of Council’s
program -— namely, to help Sam
Frosh become an integral part of
the student body and to give him
whatever school spirit that upper-
class men can hand down to the
new student. \

The case concerned John Simp-
son, freshman from Ellsworth Cen-
ter, who neglected to attend his
first three orientation classes, to
wear his dink, and who in general
showed an adverse attitude towards
Pitt and the orientation program.

The court, consisting of ten men
representing all the honor societies
on the campus (Druids, national
honorary sophomore fraternity, had
not yet named a representative,
who will become the eleventh judge
on the court.), did not start the
proceedings with the idea that Simp-
son was obviously guilty. Instead
they had him present as the charges
were read. He was given the chance
to answer them, and then to ask
any questions of the court or make
any comments.

Simpson couldn't "answer them”
in a manner to convince anyone of
his willingness to go along with
the program. He knew that wearing
the dinks was compulsory, but he
didn’t think it meant him. He knew
he was supposed to go to orienta-
tion class, but the orientation exam
is “pretty easy” and "I heard I
could pass it by only going to the
last three of the six meetings,” he
said.

Later in the proceedings he called
Pitt "just a factory.” He claimed
that Men’s Council had no right to
levy such a program as they weren’t
forced to undergo a similar one
themselves.

Joe Wolfe, supreme justice of the
court, explained patiently that the
program was not to allow upper-
classmen to gloat over any new
freshmen hardships. “When most
of the students on this court,” he
said, "were freshmen it was im-
possible to gain any kind of class
spirit for a couple of reasons -- the
classes were too large and there
were many older students among
us.”

The dinks are to give your class
a common denominator, something

.to make it possible to recognize
people you’ll be going to dances
with and be graduating with, he
went on to say.

He further stressed the importance
of the orientation classes. Remark-
ing on an experience of a Pitt stu-
dent who went to summer ROTC
camp and was embarassed when
his fellow students didn’t know
the songs and cheers well enough
to even offer a nominal competi-
tion with the other schools present,
Wolfe pointed out that one of the
purposes of the classes was to
teach these songs and cheers to
the students. At the games and
rallies these classes have proved
their worth many times.

Si‘mpson, after hearing this
lengthy explanation, still continued
his flagrant attitude towards the
court which by the way, is a body
set up by an organization elected
from the students. Its parallel may
be found in our country’s govern-
ment in the special investigating
committees set up by Congress.

Men’s Council Upperclass Court
did nothing more drastic than re-
quest him to secure a dink, allow-
ing him‘ a reasonable amount of
time to do so, and informed him that
in addition to his regualr orienta-
tion class meeting, he will meet
with his upperclass counselor an
additional two times a week.

This verdict allows the fresh-
man the chance to get a new slant
on the program it doesn't punish
him in anyway. Every freshman
with the exception of about three
out of one thousand secured a dink
during freshman week. Simpson was
only told to catch up with the crowd
that’s been ahead of him for three
weeks. The other part of the ver-
dict which involves four extra meet-
ings with hisupperclass counselor,
isn’t so terrible in the lightof the
fact that he’s missed three regular
meetings. He was, in actuality,
only asked to attend one more meet-
ing than the other freshmen have
to attend.

Some people buck Men’s Council
on the whole idea of the freshmen
program; but it’s hard to say any-
thing against the way they're carry-

 

ing it out.

Open Letter To Tech

Dr. Robert E. Doherty, President
Carnegie Institute of Technology
Pittsburgh 13, Pennsylvania

Dear Dr. Doherty:

University of Pittsburgh officers, faculty, and student leaders

regret exceedingly the incidents

that took place on the Carnegie

Tech campus yesterday (Monday) morning. As I said during our
conference today the unauthorized student’ group that visited
your campus did not exercise good judgment. Our students have
no privilege to roam boisterously through your buildings, enter
and disrupt classes, and be destructive of property. .

At Pitt we want athletic victories and approve a reasonable
celebration of these victories. Our celebrations must not be at
the expense of our neighbors, on their property, or disturbqtheir

educational program.

Again I say we regret the incidents of Monday morning and

trust that responsible leadership

will prevent ‘their reoccurrence.
Very sincerely yours,

. . /gaédé
Theodore W. Biddle

Dean of Men

Cecconi Resigns
Congress Position

Student Congress

announced a

resignation, suppressed

another letter of protest, remedied an AWOL dispute, and tabled

a petition at its Monday meeting.

Lou Cecconi, senior representative to Congress, submitted
his resignation in a letter to the president.

"Finding it impossible to do a
good job on the football field and
also as a member of Student Con-
gress, I’ve decided to submit my
resignation in hopes of not retard-
ing the fine work Student Congress
does,” the letter read.

The letter of protest, returned to

the floor after last week’s defeat
and centering around Monday’s vic-
tory celebration, was proposed by
_Congressman Don Ewart.
I It requested Congress to appoint
‘a committee to write a letter to the
board of deans stating that one hour
was insufficient in which to hold
a victory rally.

Motion Out of Order

The president ruled that part of
the motion was out of order since
Congress had a corresponding sec-
retary. Phyllis Beck, the corres-
ponding secretary, offended be-
cause her impartiality was ques-
tioned, tendered her resignation as
secretary for Congress.

Her resignation was refused by a
voice vote and the chair’s ruling
was upheld.

Ewart labeled Monday’s rally a
tradegy and said the students were

sold down the river by Student Con- ,

gress. He was supported by Dick
Kovar, newly-seated Congressman,
who cited survey figures of 35 stu-
dents. Two of the 35, Kovar said
favored the one hour rally, the other
33 wanted two hours. Don Wilde,
vCongress’ treasurer, called the
S3mP1if18 $00 small to be a true
indication of student opinion.

Free Day Proposed
‘He proposed that the polling com-
mittee question the student body
in regard to a full day of freetime

part of the third period on Monday
after the Penn victory celebration.

» The bandsmen vowed not to ap-
pear at future rallies or celebrations
until Monday’s cuts were erased
from the books and plans perfected
to allow them time to return instru-
ments to the Stadium.

       

Lot (ammo) CECCONI ’

Dean Biddle, after conferring with
Mr. Arthur, promised to have offi-
cial pardons the following day.

The tabled petition was the re-
quest by lilmer Brock, La Salle
College, to have Pitt join the Na-
tional Student Association.

Brock, regional chapter president
of the NSA, said the cultural and
collegiate student government as-
S0C1aU0f1 offers much valuable in-
formation aid to its members.

during the spring semester with the
time added to the school calendar.
The day, according to Wilde, would

be spent hour by hour for celebra. ,

tions, rallies, tap day, and other
such activities. The motion was
carried by acclamation.

Ewart’s proposal was defeated by
a 7-5 vote. The tW0 vote margin
was the same as the one which beat
down the previous meeting’s pro-
test.

The AWOL dispute was raised
by eight band members who claimed
their instructors refused‘ to accept
oral excuses for absences during__

Dr. Parran
Feted for

Services

Dr. Thomas Parran, dean of the
Graduate School of Public Health,
was honored last Tuesday at a tea

for his achievements as surgeon,

general in the U.S. Public Health
Service from 1936 to 1948.

In tribute to Dr. Parranfhis asso-
ciates established a $5,000 Thomas
Parran scholarship in the Pitt Grad-
uate School of Public Health.

According to the provisions of
the grant the principal of the fund
will be adminstered by the Univer-
sity. The income will be used for
the payment of tuition for at least
one student during each session.

Additional voluntary contributions
will be made from time to time by
present and former personnel of the
U.S. Public Health Service in apprec-
iation for the brilliant leadership
given by Dr. Parran in the field of
public health.

D . THOMAS PARRAN

The presentation was made by
Dr. Charles L. Williams Sr., assis-
tant surgeon general, at a tea in the
officeofDr. R. H. Fitzgerald, chan-
cellor of the University.

In accepting the scholarship for
the trustees and faculty of the Uni-
versity, Dr. Fitzgerald declared,
‘I am happy to accept this gifg, a
fitting tribute to your old friend and
our new one.’

Among the invited guests at the
presentation were the trustees of
the A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust, the deans of the
University's schools, the com-
mittee on the Pitt Medical Center
development, and representatives
from local industrial and educa-
tional foundations.

In addition to serving three ap-
pointments as surgeon general of
the U.S. Public Health Service, Dr.
Parran was one of the organizers
of the World Health organization in

In tomorrow's battle of music
between the University of Pitts-
burgh Varsity Marching Band and
the Ohio State Band, the local
odds-makers are spotting the Pitt
Band three tubas and an E-flat
cornet. The local organization
feels that they will win by a row
of drums.

Pitt’shalf-time routine will prob-
ably set some sort of a record in
that. they are going to do ten for-
matrons in six and one-halfminutes.

They briefly include two radio
towers and a streak of lightning,
«(Hi Ohio’n («Hi U_A1l’n uGive
Thanks" (special routine for the
Community Fund), and the Panther
Head.

The University’s45-piece Fresh-
man band will make their first
appearance of the year. This or-
ganization has been in rehearsal
since the first of the semester but
has been unable to make an appear-

   MC Discusses New Plan

To Lift Lagging Spirit

The “absence of school spirit” is being attacked by Men's
Council. ‘Their plan, which is only in the discussion stages so
far, would include either a class or a school organization system.

There is the third possibility of a system being based 01'! the
various clubs and organizations on the campus.

The class organization system
would be based on each class work-
ing as a separate unit with its own
activities and officers. A supreme
council would be set up of repre-
sentatives of the freshmen, sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors, to co-
ordinate activities on an overall
basis.

The school organization system
is basically similar to the class
organization in structure. It would,
however, have each school-
College, Bus. Ad., Engr. and Mines,
etc.,-as a separate unit with its
own elected officers, and a sup-
reme council instead of each class.

The club system would have
each club on the campus send a
representative to asupreme council.

There is already a comparable
system working for the women stu-
dents.

This system which has been in
existence for about 30 years does
not include a supreme council as
the proposed men’s plan does.

Under the women’s system each
class, startingwith the sophomores,
operates with its own by-laws and
officers. These by-laws are set up
in the freshmen year by the Fresh-
man Council, a body made up of
one representative from each orien-
tation group.

The classes jointly sponsor pro-
jects like the Mothers’ Tea, the
Interclass Sing, and class good-
will efforts. In line with this the
junior class serves as a big sister

‘class to the frosh, as does the

senior class with the sophomores.

Auto Mishap

Injures Five

Five Pitt students and a woman
pedestrian were injured Wednesday
in an automobile accident on Belle-
field Ave. near Bayard St. The stu-
dents_were treated for minor in-
juries in Mercy Hospital. Theywere:

Richard K. Smith, 23, of 1200
Berkshire Ave.; Charles Fisher,
20, of 2061 Walton St.; William F.
Minnich Jr., 23, of 318 Washington
Rd., Mt. Lebanon; Donald Petz, 23,
of 4725 Wallingford Rd., and James
Patton, 23, of 672 Means Ave.,
Bellevue.

The pedestrian, Miss Mabel G.
Moore, 61, of 604 12th Ave., Mun-
hall, is in the hospital with a frac-
tured leg and back injuries. Her
condition is listed as serious.

According to police, the car struck
Miss Moore, as the driver, Smith,
attempted to pass another vehicle
which swerved and forced Smith
off the road and onto the sidewalk.

U.S . Offers Social

Science Positions

Seniors majoring in any of the
social sciences are eligible for
j0b’s in the world's biggest insur-
ance enterprise, the U.S. Social
Security Administration.

The Civil Service Commission
has announced an examination for
junior professional assistant -- soc-
ial science analysts.

Applications must be filed by
Nov. 8. Froms may be obtained from
the U.S. Civil Service representa-
tive at local post-offices, or from
the Student Placement Bureau,

Graduate
Exam Set

Examinations for which students
can't cram will be held Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday of next
week.

The Graduate Record examina-
tions are scheduled in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial for Nov. 7,
and 8 from 1 to 5 p.m. and on Nov.
9 from 1 to 4 p.m.

Seniois in the School of Educa-
tion who were not tested as sopho-
mores, and graduating seniors of
the College will take the tests.

The examinations, known as
tests of general education are com-
prehensive, measuring the educa-
tional attainment of students in
higher education in eight fields:
Vocabulary, general mathematics,
biological science, arts, social
studies, literature, physical sci-
ence, and effectiveness of expres-
sion.

Many graduate and professional
schools require transcripts of the
records. Students may also use
their scores for self-evaluation and
in academic counseling and guid-
ance.

Pitt students have ranked above

the national average in general
mathematics, physical science ,
and social studies. Scores are

slightly below the average in the
fields of literature, arts, and effec-
tiveness of expression.

All students in the College are
required to take the examination
before they graduate. However,
his score on the test does not
affect the individual’s eligibility
to graduate.

a strong passing attack against
Ohio State.

"It’s not going to be a soft

Sub on High School Team
Now Starter for Frosh 

By STANLEY SKIRBOLL
From second string on his high school team to first string on the
Pitt frosh is the story of James Jennings.
It's a story of hustle, determination, and spirit.
A secondstringér on his Central Catholic team, Jennings was pri-

marily a defensive left halfback.
His offensive work was limited to
the "times when the starting half-
back needed a rest or got hurt.”

When he came to Pitt, Jennings
was made a right halfback, rele-
gated to the fourth string. But he
always hustled. He ran to position,
he ran from it, and ran back again.

Got a Trial

Coach Ted Schmitt and back
icoach Ed Shedlosky couldn’t help
but notice Jennings. They tried
him out with the first two teams,
found that he was good on defense,
but weak on offense. "He still has
a lot to learn about running the
ball,” Schmitt said, “but the
important thing is that he wants
to learn.”

An example of the 5 foot 11
inch, 175-pound halfback’s deter-
mination to make good can beillus-'
trated from an incident ‘during the
first few days of practice. Not all
the equipment for the frosh had
arrived, and what had come was
already given out.

Afraid that delay in getting on
the practice field would shove him
further back than he already was,
Jennings came .to Eilsworth the
next day with his own equipment.

May be Jinx

Jennings has a peculiar nick-
name--Jinx. "I got it,” he ex-
plained, “during basketball season
for Central. We ‘played six games
while I was on the team, and we
lost them all. Then I stayed away
and they won the next two.”

POA CLINIC

The Pitt Officials Association
will sponsor a basketball clinic
next Wednesday at 4:45 at the
Stadium pavilion. A.L.Walsh, West
Penn official, will conduct the
clinic. All teams are asked to
send representatives. ’

JIM JENNI GS
From bottom to top

Friends of Jim Jennings, the
freshman players, and the Pitt
coaches hope that the nickname,
like his past reputation, will stay
in high school.

iWingback-Weak Gridders

Must Make Up for Loss

By DAVE POLLOCK
Instead of running into a crippled Pitt attack on Saturday,
Ohio State may discover that something has been added to the
Panther offense before the day is over. _
With the uncertainty surrounding the condition of Wingback

Jimmy Joe Robinson, Mike Milligan
has been working extra hard on a
passing attack to supplement the
loss of Robinson's running.

Every back on the Pitt squad
has been filling the air with pig-
skins this week.

May Call on Carl

The man who could very easily
step into the main role in to-
morrow’s clash is Carl DePasqua.

Carl has completed six of eight
passes this fall. One went for a
TD against Miami when the Pitts
needed it. Another DePasqua pass
went for a score in the clutch
against Penn, but it was called
back because of an offside penalty.

The Pitt fullback also had a
good day on the ground against the
Quakers, and it is possible that
Milligan may take some of the
pressure off Lou Cecconi and let
DePasqua open up.

Tough on Bucks

Also adding to such a proba-

bility, is the fact that DePasqua

. has been exceptionally tough
against Wes Fesler and his Buck-
eyes.

In 1947 he completed a pass to
Cecconi for a touchdown that
sewed up the Panthers’ upset of
Ohio State. And last year he got
off a 48-yard run and was one of
the few standouts in the Jungle
Cats’ 41-0 loss to the Buckeyes.

Outside of Robinson, the Pitts
will be in-good physical shape for
tomorrow.Bobby Plotz, Ted Gerem-
sky, and Bill Hardisty will all
return to the lineup for the Home-
coming tilt.

In the Pitt-Buckeye series, the
Scarlet and Gray leads with nine
victories against three losses and
one scoreless tie. The lastPittvic-
tory was in 1947 whenthe Panthers
clawed the Buckeyes, 12--0.

DTD, Pi Lam
Fight to Tie

Two well matched teams, the
Delta Tau Delta and the Pi Lambda
Phi, played to a 6-6 deadlock at
the Oval Tuesday. The score may
imply a cautious brand of ball but
both teams tr_ied everything in the
book.

In the first quarter the Pi Lams
surprised everyone when Ed Ben-
jamin tossed a perfect strike to Ed.
Langue in the endzone for the first
counter. It was a smoothly executed
sleeper play, Langue slipping
through from nowhere.

At the end of the half the Lams
lead 6-0, although Don Heverlys’
sharp passing arm and.Kent Thorpes’
dangerous running were threaten-
ing every minute. The third period
saw a DTD touchdown-bound drive
stopped on the Pi Lam five. I

In the fourth quarter the Delts
evened the score when Heverly
connected with Thorpe who ran it
over.

As the clock ran out both teams
played wide open ball. Not even
the cold weather kept tempers from
getting hot and the game ended with
both frats in a hot battle to score
an important Section II win-.

Dezen Stars as Eps
Beat Swot‘?-the.arts

That same afternoon the Phi Epis
were busy trouncing Sigma Chi,

26-0. The losers were never in the

ballgame.

Howie Dezen was theace for the

winners as he passed and ran his
team to their lopsided victory.

  011 The Hudson

By IIYRON KOPBLIIAN
Sports Editor

 

The Black Knights of the Hudson are rapidly becoming known as a
bunch of blackguards. Earlier this week a story came out of New York
City charging them with employing slugging and other miscellaneous
roughhouse tactics against Class F opponents.

Moreover, in a game between
Pitt’s and West Point's jayveeslast
Friday, a Cadet tossed a racial in-
sult at Rus Phillips, colored end

if that the- exception so often hurts,

A Man Not Missed

There is encouragement this week
for Mike Milligan’s club in the fact
that Pitt was not scouted at'Penn
by Dick Fischer, assistant coach
of Ohio State.

Last season Fischer spiedon the
Panthers, with the result that the
Buckeyes seemed to know what Pitt
was going to do before the Panther
quarterback had given it a thought.

At any rate, whoever scouted the
Panthers this fall must harbor a
pretty healthy respect for them.
Says a Philadelphia paper which
can't be accusedofpartiality toward
I’itt:

‘_‘In a few words, this Penn team
has more courage than class. Its
hard luck was that Pitt has both."

 

knowledge that both are deft par-
liamentarians in the newly acti-
vated Panther Club. '
Bimbo,lwho is president ofthe
club, isstriving to bring the club
to its prewar level. Groundwork
was laid last year through the work
of ex-gridder Don Fisher. This
year the club is receiving capable
assistance from‘ Dick Cassiano,
former Dream Backfield star.
Freshmen Considered
Although still in an embryonic
stage, the club is working on sev-
eral important ideas. Ingthe second
meeting of the year which was held
this week, a committee was formed
to look into the possibilities of
awards for freshmen athletes. Bol-
kovac was named to head the group.
Discussions were started on the
subject of varsity athletic awards.
New ideas brought to the attention
of theclub were blankets or blazers

consecutive "P”.
Hosts to Schoolboys

Members of the club are acting
as hosts to visiting high school
athletes, who will be~guests of
the university at all remaining foot-
ball games.

These boys may be future Pitt
stars, and the Panther Club feels
that friendly relations should be
started with these boys.

Convenes in

Pittsburgh

For the first time in their his-
tories, the Pitt, Tech and Duquesne
chapters of Scabbard and Blade,
national honorary military fraternity,
are combining to be hosts of the
organization’s 24th biennial con‘-
vention in Pittsburgh.

Of a membership of 3,000 men,
over 100 have come as delegates
from the 96 chapters throughout the
country to meet at the William Penn
l-lotel Nov. 3, 4, and 5.

The program, planned by Walter
M. Snyder, captain of the Pitt chap-
ter, began yesterday at 9 a.m. in
the Allegheny Room of the William
Penn. The welcoming speakers were
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the College at Pitt,_the Very Rev.
erend Francis P. Smith, president
of Duquesne university, and Dr.
Webster Jones, .Tech’s director of
the College Of Engineering and
Science.

At the noon dinner on Thursday,
an address was made by Captain
John L. Woodbury, USN, professor
of naval science and tactics at
Penn State.

The first day of the convention
ended with a smoker in the Carnegie
Union on the Tech campus.

Today at noon, Brigadier Gen-
eral Wendell Westover addressed
the delegates. The program for to-
night includes a dance at the Wil-
liam Penn. Scabbard and Blade dele-
gates, visiting dignitaries, and the
combined military staffs of the three

Henry Eberhart Orchestra.

Between 20 and 35 girls" each
from Pitt, Tech, and Duquesne are
acting as blind dates for the visit-
ing delegates.

Speakers, at Saturday’s noon dinner
will be Colonel Marshall Strickler,
Air Force, ROTC division, and Major
Thomas E. Persinger.

Instead of having the usual tour
of Pittsburgh for the delegates, na-
tional headquarters of Scabbard
and Blade bought 150 tickets to the
afternoon's Pitt-Ohio State football
game.

As the convention finale, the dele-
gates will attend a banquet Saturday
evening. Commander John P. Brack-
en, USN, president of the Reserve
Officers’ Association, will be the

speaker at this last event.

A great deal of the success of
the Pitt Players’ “Arsenic and

artwork of the makeup crew led by
Ruth Schwartz. Ben Tatar’s suc-

in large part due to his fine make-
up--he really looks like Boris Kar-

will add considerably to the fur-
ther success of the Pitt Players
in the next four years.
