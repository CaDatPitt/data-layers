Every time you pause and re-

Dr. Charles Glen King, profes-
sor of chemistry and discoverer of
a new method of isolating vitamin
C, has urged Pitt students to keep
physically ﬁt by making sure tbnt
their diets also contain wheat,

fruits, and meat.
The executive committee of the
Food and Nutrition board. of the
National Research council, of which
‘Dr. King is a member, is consider-
ing the problem of improving the
health and efficiency of the civilian

ylpopulation through a proper diet.

The board, composed of some of
the country’s leading authorities on
diet, reﬂects the changed attitude-
toward food requirements since
World War I.

Instead of campaigning to "save
wheat” and “save meat" in order
-to supply armed forces, the Na-
tional Council, at the request of
the government, will assist in feed-
ing civilians and soldiers to pro-
vide best health, efficiency, and
morale. _ \

Dr. W. S. McEllroy, dean of the
School ofi‘Medicine, has appointed
Dr. Frank Evans of the Western
Pennsylvania hospital staff chair-
man of ‘the local committee,iwhich
plans a thorough survey, to find
the extent of malnutrition and
kinds most common.

Following the survey it is to start

-on éducational campaign to reach
all parts of the population.

Benefits of Plan 

Questionnaire to
Settle Speed-up

By ALBERT MAVRINAC

Plans for the establishment of
the proposed trimester curriculum
at the University were marking
time today pending two develop-
ments:

1. Final tabulation of the stu-

. dent questionnaire submitted dur-
ing registration.

2. Outcome of the pending con-
gressional action to ﬁnancially aid
universities on the trimester sys-
tem.

Tabulationand analysis of stu-
dent opinion of the proposed plan
is now under way and the results
of the poll are expected to be an-
nounced shortly.

Private opinion polls on the ques-
tion, however, seem to indicate that
main student opposition to the plan
will come‘ as a result of the loss
of opportunity to earn tuition dur-
ing the summer months.

This " objection may be lessened
somewhat if the proposed con-
gressional plan to award new gov-
ernmental scholarships to deserv-
ing students is adopted by the Con-
gress. D

At present this plan is making
very little progress, crowded out
as it is by the more pressing prob-
lems of military defense of the na-
tion. V

Some hopes have been held in
Washington and by some Pitt of-
ficials that some type of govern-
ment support will be forthcoming.

Another measure also pending
in a congressional sub-committee,
according to latest available infor-
mation, will probably inﬂuence the
future of the trimester plan much
more than any student opinion re-
sults. A

This is the proposal to aid insti-
tutions of higher learning through:
out the United States to make up
whatever deﬁciencies in ﬁnances
they might incur through adoption
of the trimester system by govern-
ment subsidies.

Administration sentiment seems
deﬁnitely in favor of the system
but it may be difficult. to obtain the
necessary appropriations from Con-
gress in View of the prevalent sen-
timent for a cut in “non-defense”
items. ' »

Owl To Open Annual
Undergraduate Campaign

Plans for the 1942 Owl under-
graduate sales campaign which will
begin on campus Monday, were
announced today by Don,Lingen-
felter, BA44, assistant ciiculation
manager in charge of the drive.

A sales booth will 53 set up in
the ground floor lobby,‘ where un-
dergraduates may make the one
dollar deposit on the 1942 year-
book any afternoon during the next
two weeks. A $2.50 balance is pay-
able when the Owl appears the
week of April 20, Lingenfclter
said.

Nineteen members of Druids, na-
tional honorary activities frater-
nity for sophomore men, in addi-
tion to students from the freshman,
sophomore, and junior classes, will
make the sales.

“The importance of the year-
book has been increased this year,”
John Brosky, editor asserted. “The
makeup of Owl has been altered to

include photographs and writeups

of all campus events that have re-

sulted since December 7. Photo-
“ graphs of Pitt men who are draft-
edor who enlist in the armed forc-
iesvbefore they have completed their

all seniors if an accurate account
is to be published. Seniors who
have not yet notiﬁed the Owl staff
of their activities since they came
to the University, should do so by
Wednesday of next week. Seniors
who have activities that they did
not originally list may add them
during this time, Brosky said.
The Owl undergraduate sales-
men may be identiﬁed by their gold
“1942 Owl Salesmen” ribbons
which they will Wear. Following are

“Do you have hospitalization? . . . Who do you think is going to

Pantber Adopts
TlME ‘Makeup

For New Issue

The Panther, leading college
monthly, comes out this morning,
‘ Providence willing, but it will look

like TIME, leading weekly news-‘

magazine.

Todayls issue will be the first
under the active direction of red
haired, bespectacled Dave Haley,
who was temp-orariy appointed ed-
itor by the executive committee of
the Panther.

From bright red cover throuighi

column ruled inside pages, the
style of. TIME has been adapted to
events and articles of the Univer-
sity campus.

Starting out with the depart-
mental heading: Pitt and the War,
Panther-Time discusses the recent
effects of the War on campus. Oth-
er departmental headings are Cam-
pus, Business, Personality’ of the
Month, and People, which subs for
“Rushed About.”

“Peace ,After the‘-War” by Dr.
Carl L. Stotz, assastant professor
of geography, and head of Geog-
graphic News Service, “Women in
the ‘War,” and a student poll on
war make up the current event
section.

For the information of Pitt
pre-medical students applying for
admission to the School of Medi-

,, cine, it will not be necessary for
those who have been previously
interviewed by a member of the
Committee on X Admission to be
interviewed again. This notice is
for the purpose of ‘explaining
why certain students who are ap-
plying have been asked to report
for an interview and others have
not. W. S. McEllroy

After a thin, discourag’ed-looln
ing boy left the office, Dr. Carlson
ushered me in. "This boy that 5”“
left is one of In!!! who have neg-
lected to take out lsosP5*l“3ui°n
insurance,” said the doctor. “He
lives in a rooming house down-
town. He has a 102-€le8'|‘°¢ km‘
perature. He  no money and
doesn’t know where to turn. If be
had only enronea so. 1.o.‘pit-!ka-

“There are many out-of-towm
ers at Pitt,” continued Doctor Carl-
son, “They live in boarding or fra-
ternity houses. When one of these
becomes ill, he needs someone to
take care of him.’ He can't expect
the landlady or housemother to
put herself out. She has other work
to do.”

“The average person in this
case will not usually have the 6185
needed for proper hospital care.

insurance, the‘ whole 117051931 5‘

“However,” remarked the doc
tot, “most students wait until it
is too late. Do they want us to ask
the hospital to take another char-
ity case? For atrip up to the 34th
floor Cathedral, and an outlay of
only $2.25, the whole picture 15

— straightened out.”

In parting, Dr. Carlson advised,
T‘/‘Every Pitt student should cogne
up to the olﬁces of the Student
Health Service for Women, 2809
Cathedral, or the Men’s , Student
Health service and enroll for the
Student Hospitalization service.”

“Students should remember that,

As the situation exists now at
Pitt most students are‘ not being
prepared with the tools required
in total" war which the. ‘college
could‘ supply. ‘They /know little
about the Army or Navy, their va-

"rious branches and‘services, or of
the opportunities open to college

Up to now the University has
failecl to recogppize the need for
total education—that intime of

student with at least some knowl-
edge that will help him play :1
larger part in total war. It is the
duty of the student to acquire such
knowledge; it is the duty of the
University to prepare the student
to meet total war with a trained
mind. ‘

A‘ total program. of education
must be established. Some of the
suggestions which could be imme-
diately incorporated are: ' '

1. Thorough program of physi-
cal‘ education‘ for every male‘ stu-
dent. Tech has started this along
with many other colleges. Why not
Pitt?_ Lack of facilities some claim.

In reality there is no lack of fa.-
cilities, but a lack of vision to im-
provise and use, by careful plan-

ning, the existing facilities. It could

be done; it must be done. -
2.'Eve1-y student should becom
pellcd to include courses of study
which will be of (lirectaid in to-
tal war. Harvard university out-‘
-lined for tl1_e}'i.f stju/clents a list ,0?
such courses, and told its students
that it was their duty to take sev-
eral. of them.

Math, chemistry,_ physics, geog-
raphy, languages--all are essen-
tial in total war. English, philos-
ophy, and history are least import-
ant. The essential courses should
be condensed and oﬁered to every
male student. He should be required
to take at least two.

The University annoi1nced.“war

3. Many opportunities are ‘open
in the armed forcesiand in the gov-

Most students don't know about
them. Most of their information is
gathered from newspapers about
such opportunities. Many are never
heard about. The University should
set up a group whose duty it shall
be to inquire about these oppor-

would keep itself informed and
make itself available for every stu-
dent.

-Wounds, continued: .

Punctured wounds require spe-
cial consideration, because they do
not bleed freely, because they are
difficult to clean out, because it is
difficult to apply an antiseptic well
into the wound. And since no air
can get into the wound, there is
possibility of lock jaw. ‘

The first aid treatment of a
punctured wound consists of en-
couraging bleeding, being careful
not to bruise the tissues, and then
working iodine well down into the
wound. And, of course, a physi-
cian's advice must be sought.

ermen Meet Rider In t Opener

Wilde Leads Panther Swimmers

By PAUL CERCHIARA

Panther Varsity" swimmers will leave Pittsburgh today
at 3 o’clock for their meet with Rider College, Saturday, in
Trenton, N. J. Coach Ben Grady, manager Frank Vajda, and
a twelve man squad are making the trip in automobiles and
will return from the battlefront Sunday night.

Even though the opposition has already lost two meets,
the Gold and Blue representatives are looking forwartl to
a hard fought battle, with the outcome at close score either
way. With Rider’s small squad compared to most of their op-
ponents, Coach Moore is banking on condition rather tha_’n

reserves. Lack of reserves is also

Pitt/s chief weakness this year.

Graduation and losses to Uncle
Sam’s army have cut heavily into
the ranks of the veterans, six men
having departed from last year’s
12—man Rider aggregation. These
six were responsible‘ for almost
half of the points tallied, including
high man Irwin Goodman who en-
tered 23 events in 9 meets and cop-
ped 87 points. 

Pitt has had its losses too, the
greatest being that of standout div-
er Dick Ames. Ames could always
be counted on to bring in his share
of points but now that he is gone
it is going to be up to Joe Kaule,
,a. promising prospect. Diving
.a3'ail1S.l: Joe will be. Rider’s star
Performer George Hornyach. Horn.
yaclris the boy who ﬁnished sec-
ond to Ames in last year's battle.

.- Gus Wilde will be the man to

watch in the sprints. Gus has been
coming along great in practice, and
if his pre-season showing in that
P.A.A. district meet can be used as
an indication, then he is in for a
real start of a big season. It is
around Wilde that this year’s var-
sity is being built, and the general
opinion of the swimming fans is
that as Wilde goes so will the rest
of the team.

Wilde has had’ two years of var-
sity experience. and during this
time has slowly but steadily been
acquiring the polish necessary to

— make him a competitor of cham-
pionship caliber.

Assisting Wide in ‘trying to gar-
ned enough points_for chalking up
a Pitt victory will be J0e- Orloﬂ’,
captain Herb Cosgrove, Al Sam-
son, Joe Kaule, and Herd Krongold.
Cosgrove, Orloff, and Stan Sutnick
are to be used with Wilde in the
sprints-

for campus organizations to dem-
onstrate their patriotism, the
groups, by competing against each
V 1 other for maximum ‘sales honors,

lfest sales record will receive ac-
claim in the city papers, and pos-
‘ sibly on a national scale, he main-
tained. ‘
