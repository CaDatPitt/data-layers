Rescheduled for Today

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

The preliminary hearing for
three Pitt football players arrested
on assault charges last week was
postponed yesterday and reset for
today by Pittsburgh magistrate
Joseph Givens.

The rescheduling occurred after
the players, senior_ Tom Perko and

"juniors John, Pelusi and David

Treiber, failed to appear in court at
1 p.m. yesterday. I .
‘Givens reluctantly approved
today's hearing after earlier
issuing a warrant for their arrest.
After being summoned, the
players’ attorney, Samuel Scuillo,
arrived in court to argue that he
and the players had received notice
from magistrate Anthony Troiano,
who arraigned the players last
week, that the hearing was to take
place today.
“I had a‘ right to rely on this
notice from Troiano,” Scuillo told
Givens. “This is the only paper I

had with a date for the hearing and .

it says the 26th.”

Givens countered that news-
paper and television stories
throughout the past week had
stated the day for the hearing was
Tuesday, -and that arraignment
papers drawnup on the day of the

ROBERT MARSHAL}

 

arrest also gave the same date.

Troiano, while presiding over
another case in city court, said the
notice he sent to Scuillo setting the
hearing date for Wednesday was a
mistake, When he noticed
reporters were present, he berated
Scuillo’s legal assistant, who had
questioned him.

“It’s a mistake, I admit it, but
are you going to slap me in the face
in court and in front of reporters?”
Troiano said. f‘Is this what I get for
doing you and.your football players
a favor?”

Troiano admitted he had_ tried to
keep the players away from news
reporters when he arraignedvthem
last Wednesday. -

‘‘I kept them out of the public
eye so they could play against Penn
State,” Troiano, said.

Givens issuedian ofﬁcial warrant
for the arrests of the absent players

and hinted that Troiano purposely‘

altered the hearing date.

“Are you suggesting there was
no honest mistake?” Scuillo asked
Troiano. .

“I certainly am,’
magistrate.

Scuillo called the proceedings an
“abortion of justice" in asking for
a 24-hour postponement of the
hearing. '

Pitt admission procedures will
not change, CAS Dean Robert
Marshall said at Tuesday’s CAS
Council meeting.

The Council primarily concerned
itself with the number of admis-
sions for next year and the criteria
for transfer admissions.

The number of freshmen for the
1976 fall '.term will be maintained

at 1,750, the Council decided. The‘

tentative ceiling was based on
assumed ﬁnal acceptances out of
the 3,200 accepted applicants.
Transfer students seeking ad-
mission-to Pitt must have a
minimum QPA of 2.5—another
criteria that will be maintained.

BY JANMEDOFF

Though the football coupon
system used for the ﬁrst time this
year came under ﬁre early, most
Pitt students now believe it was a
success.

An informal poll of Pitt students,
taken after the ﬁnal regular-season
game, revealed that 74 of the 100
surveyed said the coupon system
operated in a fair manner. The
most common response to the
system was typiﬁed by a student
who said, “I didn’t mind the
coupons because everyone got in
the game who wanted to.”

Though most students felt the
coupon system was run in a fair
manner, only 48% of those polled
thought it should_be repeatednext"
year. ‘

Keith Wassum, a senior political
science major, said, “This whole
big hassle was for nothing, man.”
_ Forty-two per cent said the
coupon system should be run again
and 10% had no opinion. Most of
the opposition to having coupons

again came from upperclassmen '

who were used to the days when
one could get into a football game
with an ID card.

None of those questioned was
actually “shut out” of a game,
though the mere threat of not being
able to attend a game forced some
students into action. Six of those
surveyed reported buying tickets to
avoid missing a game. ‘

Over the past several years the
number of transfer students has
dramatically increasedat Pitt. The
lowering of the QPA from 3.0 to 2.5
was one reason given by the
-Council. Another cause cited was
pressure ‘from the community
colleges to gain easier acceptance
for their students who transfer.

‘,‘»Most of the pressure. is political
and most of it comes out of
Harrisburg,” remarked Robert
Nossen, associate provost for
regional campuses. 0 According to
Nossen, this has caused easier
acceptance of transfers and a
lowering of grades.

Though some state colleges
accept transfers with QPAs as low

Br GEORGENE KALEINA

Several students have questioned the educational value
of the course “Introduction to Economics” (Economics 80)
for various reasons. They complained that the class is too
large. that the professor himself teaches only one-third of
the classes, and that the teaching assistants who conduct
back-to-back lectures lose interestin the course.

One student said, “I, unlike many of my grade—obsessed
freshman peers who take the course, am somewhat
interested in the quality of education I’m receiving; 1 am a
consumer with a right to some standard of quality and
service." V

A recitation teaching assistant, John Miller, agreed that
the classes are too large: ‘-‘There are too many students in
one class to have an efﬁcient manner of lecturing,” Miller
said‘.

Economics 80 supervisor Jack Wegman backed Miller’s
opinion,."“l have to agree there are too many people in one
class so the lecturer ‘can't establish a1rapport,with. the

College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) determines the number
of classes." ' - ‘

There are nearly 200 students enrolled in each of the '

three lecture sessions, according to Wegman.
“Since Economics 80 is a survey course, the lecture is
designed not to make everything completely clear but to

whet the students’ appetite for clariﬁcation in the recitation '

period," Wegman said.

He said more money had to be allocated to create more
classes. “Students have got to talk to the University
administrators. It's a matter of a budget problem.”

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg
commented on _the class size. “We have a number of
courses that are run successfully in large classes,” he said.
“We usually want to make the good faculty available to a
large "number of students.”

' "However, I want to know the concerns of the students J

and how widespread it is,” Rosenberg said. "We can look
into what's going on but can't implement changes very
soon because of winter pre-registration.’p' . _

assistant Gerald Carlino said, “Econ 80 has’ to be

team-taught. Dr. Slesinger is trying to accommodate all the _.  I N
students who want the course and.that’s the only way to do .  

it." I
Slesinger commented on the criticisms of the'students._
“We could hold the. lecture down to 100 students and then

half the students wouldn’t get in,” Slesinger said. “It’s at.’

team-teaching proposition under my supervision, and if

students feel the teaching assistants are losing interest,

they should comment to us so we can deal with‘ it..
“Students have every right to come to my office with

complaints," Slesinger said. “As for me teaching a third of -
the course, that's the way it is set up so students can ‘get.

exposure to other instructors in the course."

Wegman pointed out that the teaching assistants
conducting the lectures are further along in their
dissertations and are competent to teach the course.

criticismsjn part were valid. "The problem come down to _a

budget problem," Thorn said. “We are operating under a

“Over-fragmentation” refers to
a clause in Act 195 of the State
Employes Act, which prohibits the
split of state services (of which Pitt
is‘ considered a part) into too many
bargain units, creating problems

’ for operation and administration in

conﬂict with the best interests of

as 2.2, Pitt will not. The
admissions committee will continue
to reject a “D” grade from a‘
transfer student.

The Council also examined some .
of the current trends affecting
Pitt’s admission procedures.

Post-secondary school applica-
tions‘ are increasing, according to
the Council's report. This trend is
being caused by greater numbers
of secondary-schoo_l students,
greater numbers of part-time’
students, and an increasing num-
ber of persons coming back to
school. I "

The urban ‘university also is

' becoming, more commonplace.

According to Dean of Admissions
Kenneth Wenger, a large amount
of students seek their college

education in the city.

Since_Pitt became state-funded,
60% of the freshmen come from
Allegheny County, and 94% come
from Pennsylvania.

The Council noted a decrease in
the average Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT) scores of freshmen.
The average verbal score is now
500, some 50 points .lower than
scores of several years ago. 0 ‘But
this trend also is seen at other
universities and colleges, Wenger
contended. '

The value of achievement tests
as admissions --requirements was
questioned by the council.

“We do not use them ,on a
decision, unless it is in apositive
manner,” Wenger said..

He also pointed out that some '

students take the American College
Test (ACT) with the SAT and

' . . . . . . » _ - , . *4

achievement tests. This costs theév

student $17 for the SAT and $17.50
for the ACT.

“I would like to have them take
either the SAT and the achieve-
ment tests or the ACT,” Wenger
said. “I am looking out for the
students’ welfare, and I don't think
we need to have them take both.”

The Council decided to look into
Wenger’s proposals and consider
them in the future.

AfricanClassroom in Works    

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR

The Cathedral's twentieth
nationality room, depicting the
African heritage, is being created
at .a projected cost of $150,000,
according to Walter C. Worthing-
ton, chairman of the room’s
planning committee.

The African Heritage Classroom

will be on the third ﬂoor, adjacent ‘
,_ to the Early American Room.

the University architects to ensure

the desired authenticity, Worthing- -

ton said. “Although we are hoping
the mom will be ready for use in
two years, it will neverreally be
completed; the possibilities of the
room are limitless. '

“We are A just beginning to
discover Africa: and all that it
implies,” he added. V

The ﬁrst- attempt to establish

‘ such a room failed in 1937. One of

the problems, now as then, stems
from the mulitplicity of the African

 

 

past and present, Worthington
said. “We are striving for minority
as well as majority cultural
expressions. ” '

. The focusof the room is not on

The black community's collective
sense of _the room’s worth and
purpose, Worthington said, will be
a legacy to posterity. . “We
(Afro-Americans) won ’t have to run
around to find out what our identity
is because it will be right there,”
he said. '

Tomorrow being Thanksgiving, there come to mind several things

7the packaged, popular image played up in card shops across the

Of Genetic
Engineering
BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Although the federal govern-
ment is oft criticized for back
pedaling and avoiding crucial
issues, one committee recently has
delivered aifull ‘reporton the issue‘
of genetic engineering.

Because the rapid progress of
gene research has put the design
and manufacture of human beings
right around the corner, the federal
government has produced guide-
lines for the production of human
beings.

The President’s Committee on

Citizen Construction, a bipartisan
con-,

commission that recently
cluded its deliberations, has drawn,
a series of speciﬁcations. » ‘
Senator Hotgod, a conservative
from the Western portion of the
United States and conﬁrmed
Republican, summed up the

‘guidelines as another promising.
stroke for the maintenance of good

Americans.
“We had problems,” Hotgod

said, shaking his bald head. “For .

instance, whether or not to include
genitalia, and if so, what size.

‘There were ‘quite a few bitter

disagreements over design -propo-

_sals, but it was ﬁnally decided that

sexual organs should go.

“Not” that the committee in any
way intends that sex should be
eliminated, but the simple fact is
that the whole deal is better
conducted under laboratory condi-
tions. I think the report will bear
this out.”

Hotgod also pointed out that the.
cerebral mechanism (the brain in
laymen’s terms) had been altered
slightly to accommodate constitu-
tional law.

—— Letter to the Editor-—

policy to restrict ﬁlm programming
chiefly to those two groups.” This

’ is easily transposed by interpreta-

tion to.mean:' restrict film
programming ONLY to those two
This is not always the
case. the most recent evidence
being the Comedy Film festival
presented by Alpha Phi Omega on

. Friday, November 14, in Benedum

Auditorium. Many
instances can be cited.

As to possible law enforcement
entanglement—ye’s, this is posible.

It is also possible that. California
willbreak off _the continent and
ﬂoat away. The real question is-
how probable is it. For the past two
years. Deep Throat has been
featured all over Pittsburgh with-
out harrassment.

Unless the University decides it
is a separate community of
Pittsburgh and calls in its own
police. there is no reason to expect
seizure by any other agency.

Because these facts and alterna-
tives as I have presented do exist, I
feel there is a good chance. through
adequate preparation, to state the
case convincingly to the University
administration. I will no longer
wage a one-man battle. though.

analagous

Certain student organization offi-‘

cers have approached me to form a
student coalition to deal with this
issue. I have willingly accepted
and would like to open up its
membership to all interested
parties. '

In conclusion. I would" like to
recommend. that Moore ‘look
beyond his nose next time he
decides to make an analysis and
utilize information supplied to him
and at his convenience to present
the case succinctly and fairly. He
ccrtainl_\' has the ability to turn out
material that is journalistically
sound and llL‘\\'.s'\\'0l’lll_\'. but it is
L‘\‘.L‘ll-lll0l‘L‘ certain that his last
attempt was no indication of that
ability. . V ‘

In general, the report calls for
fewer bones, tighter expenditure of
muscle power and consolidation of
taste, feeling, sight and sound into
a “flexible trunk-type organ for
greater mobility.” '

“The tr'unk idea was mine, of‘

course,” Hotgod_ ‘stated. “lt’s
ridiculous to have‘ so many similar

‘functions spaced out all over the

body. This consolidation will make
the human body more efﬁcient.

Guest opinion

BY JAMES PECORA

We’re not gonna take it.

We’re gonna break it.

We’re gonna shake it.
We'll forget it better still.
- ——the Who

This depicts, rather well, the
general attitude of the people in the
19705. At one time we outwardly
questioned everything, but now we
have drifted into an apathetic
lifestyle. How long will it be before
this‘ undercurrent of discontent
surfaces? ‘ - .

A recent exampleiof this apathy

'is the apparent disconcern that Pitt

students have in the case of the
alleged assault on a ‘man and a
woman by three Pitt football
players. This incident occurred
almost two weeks ago and thus far
no comments have been made
about it. The facts are still
somewhat vague, so a comment on
the entire incident would be
impossible and unfair.

However. one fact is explicit, and
that is the intervention by the Pitt
athletic department. -1 feel that the
athletic department has overstep-
ped its bounds (if it has any) when
it sought to protect these three
players. This is a purely legal
matter. and. realizing that. I would
not make any judgments about the
guilt or innocence of these three
men. ‘The athletic department.
without any noticeable hesitation,
saw ﬁt to step in and aid “their"
football players. The question I
pose. is: ‘How far will the
department go to" protect its"
athletes? Better _vet: How far will

in front of it is wearing a tall hat.

The design will also be able to look

around corners-—priceless in intel-
ligence and military work.”

One proposal to include more

efﬁcient legs, perhaps four, _to '

enable the design to_ go great
distances without ‘an automobile,
was struck -down when the Auto
Lobby stormed the_chambers with
automatic weapons. V

The end result is that the design ‘

will eat twice as much as the
"present. average citizen, wear twice
as much clothing and drink twice as

“This design is not only good for ‘

America, but good for industry,”
Hotgod said.

When asked if he wouldialloiw his
daughter to marry one, H'otgod’s
reply was only a sick smile. “I’l1 be

dead by then anyhow-.”

«One report stated the committee

‘had forgotten to include lungs,
circulatory systems and kneecaps,

although the design is equipped

with two digestive systems and 300 

separate teeth.

Calling Interference

in the same situationfthere would
have been no attempt by Pitt to
“bail them out.” The reason is
that the nonathletic students are
not. as important as the athletic
students—at least, not important
enough to help out in this manner.
(By the way, nonathletic students

do comprise the majority of_

students at the University—if
anyone forgot.) Nonathletic
students are helped by Pitt in other
ways, but not to the extreme extent
to which athletic students are.

I agree a gciod football program
is of great importance to the entire
Uriiversity, but by giving these
athletes this type of protection, the
indications would be that the ends
justify the means——and.they do not.
I also would agree with some of the
privileges extended to athletes
because of their talent, but there
must be some sort of limitations.
Apparently; the athletic depart-
ment saw its intervention as within
the limitations; I do not. In fact, I
see this as a deﬁnite abuse of
special privileges.

The exposure of, this entire
incident to the news media was
unfair to the three football
players;——were three average stu-
dents involved. it would not have
hit the papers as hard. However,
this exposure did serve a purpose.
at the expense of the three
involved. and that is showing
where to set the boundaries on
special priivilegesifor athletes. My-

concern here is not with the
speciﬁcs of this matter but with the
overall implications. I feel that
Pitt's’ athletic department would
not hesitate to intervene again and
again in similar situations. Does

BY MREA CSORBA

Set in a park away from Negley
Avenue traffic, the great stone
house has a sense of mysterious
grandeur about it. Inside, the fairy
tale was reinforced. The dimly lit
alcove that rounded back to the
length of the house contained a
wealth of treasures. The “continual
display” sculptures lined both
sides of the hall and sat warmly on
top of radiators.

A terra-cotta man sat cross-leg-
ged on his exhibition stand waiting
to be tapped on the shoulder for a
conversation.

Inside the main gallery rooms,
the contrasting themes of Martha
Shepler and’ Walter Bedel vie to-
modify the mood. 

Bedel’s stark, surrealistic scene-

scapes carry baritone qualities over
Shepler’s, which pipe her lively
turie. .

The first in the series “Flora,

Flora, inﬁnite Flora” excites us_

with its bold coloration and
electriﬁed scribblings. Also the
title is pleasantly rhythmical.

In the movements there was a
feeling of freedom, of newness and

Bill and Livia Dance
To 99c Theatre Tune

BY MICHAEL COHEN

Wandering minstrels no" long-
er roam the streets exuding
warmth and spirit wherever they
play. But the 99-Cent Floating
Theatre’s Billy Vanaver and Livia
Drapkin brought this spirit to the
Pittsburgh Playhouse, where they
wound up four days of a “coming
together” festival of music and
dance last Sunday night.

All who attended were active.
Whether it was singing gospel-
“Oh Lord, How long?l”—or

clapping knees—“Juba this and

Juba that...Juba stole the yellow

’cat".—those who participated con-

tributed to_ the spirit of coming
together. '

Were Billy and Livia there only
to conduct and orchestrate offbeat
clapping and singing? All had fun
clap‘ping and singing away to the
amusement of the instigators on
stage.

However, the fun and games
were not "enough to mask the
seriously multi-talented pair. They
created an unusual melting pot of
international song and dance.
American and English balladry,
medieval music and dance, Russian
toe-dancing, and hornpipe-clog
dancing combined for" a- folk-art
potpourri. ‘

“Black Lung,”

American ballad lamenting the

Casals Trio Unities

"BY PAMELA EUSI

In 1973, Pablo Casals invited
violinist Oswalt Lehnert, cellist
Jurgen de Lemos and pianist Paul
Parmelee to play in his house. He
was so moved that he bestowedhis
name and blessings on the trio.

By far the best-performed work

_ at the Monday night concert by the
Pablo Casals Trio was the Trio in C
Major, Opus 87 by Brahms. The
introduction of a gracious, digni-

. ﬁed theme soon developed into a

' brilliant, passionate melody line. A
haunting, gypsy touch with ‘wild,
free ._m‘elodies dominated the
second movement through daring
double stops, unrestrained bow-
ings, and flowing styles.

Precise, driving rhythms helped
to switch moods from intense to

. wistful. Finally a pulsating theme
displayed thetalenfs of Parmelee
as the piano parts led the way to a
sp,ark-ling, energetic ending with a

surprise ‘extra ‘repetition of the

theme before the ﬁnal notes.

Mozart’s Trio in C Major, K. 548
opened the concert. The ﬁrst
melody came from a “mock hero
aria (operatic solo)” sung by
Figaro, from Mozart’s opera of the
same name.

Again, Parmelee clearly domina-
ted as a phrase here or there was
garnished by the violin or the cello.
Throughout all three works of the
evening, the cello had a few bright

spots but its major function was -
- that of rhythm sustainer_

Light phrases and excellent
dynamics paved the way for the
sunny, pleasant passages to come.
Galloping rhythms madejthis a very

marked: by

enjoyable, cheery work.

In sharp contrast to the bright
Mozart piece, aconteinporary work
by Leon Kirchner titled Trio
explored the ranges and various
abilities of the artists. Extended
notes from the cello faded.into a
mysterious violin part when the
roar of piano rumblings interrupted
the rather private string interlude.
Brilliant piano entrances, appropri-

ate pauses and strange intervals
“mystic chords” _

highlighted the effects used by
Kirchner.

As inﬂation sweeps through
the supermarkets, theatre can still
provide one of the best buys in
town.

‘,On_December 2,‘ the Studio
Theatre will offer two shows for the
price of one. The Apple Tree and
Masks of Angels set an unlikely
double bill for an evening of
theatre.

“There’s no single whole’ theme
or mood that we’re after,”
explained Apple Tree" director

_ Mary Bensel. “My play is_ happy

and colorful, while Stephanie’s
(Masks’ director) has a more
somber tone.”

The Apple Tree is the second
musical comedy Studio Theatre has
presented this season. Could this

‘be the start of a new trend?

Bensel said that last season,

America were brought to mind in
“Juba," a rhythmic tune exalting

was re-created through Billy
Vanaver’st mastery in _authentic

clog dancing is the forerunner of -A

modern tap dancing. Livia joined’
in as they threatened to dance a
hole through the stage floor. Those’
sitting up close were wary of loose
shoelaces. _

Billy is a virtuoso of many folk
instruments from a Russian lute to
the American banjo. Names of
instruments resembled a U.N. roll

to capture such a global ﬂavor of
folk music was unbelievable.

mund she was transformed into a
wild Russian gypsy dancing as if
aﬁre. With white turban and W1".
black boots, she danced on the
knuckles of her toes—an incredible
feat. Mood and atmosphere
changed as quickly as Billy
switched instruments.

The show ended with a creative
interpretation of ‘ ‘Garb age. ’ ’

Preseason optimism is ﬁne, but
there comes a time when all the
talk must end and an athletic team
must speak for itself and get
results. Such is the case with the
1975-76 Pitt basketball team, which
opens its season at home against
West Virginia Wesleyan College on
Saturday night. /

The enthusiasm of Pitt's team
has been overﬂowing, but its talent
will have to be up to the task when
it faces a team that already has won
two games andlost none.

“Last yearls freshman class is

Kevin Nellis, and Bill Bailey at 190
are counted on heavily."

Ray Dallatore will replace the
injured Dan Levine at 167 while
George O’Kofn and freshman Dave
Graeu will battle it out to start at
177. ‘

Jeff Minerd wrestled at 190 and
177 last year until he got injured,
but this'season he ﬁnds himself

division, competing for the starting
job with freshman Doug Spatz.

Injuries have plagued the Pan-
thers, leaving them_ about as deep
as a wading pool. Mark Popiolkos4

are injured in the 126-pound weight
class. and Doug Rhodes is injured
at 134.

Lack of depth and a slight decline
from last year‘s talent will hurt the
Panther’ chances this season, but
maybe Adams can help his players
overcome that.

“We've been teaching the
wrestlers a more aggressive style,"
Adams said. “We think this could

. BY RALPH SPARKLE

Twenty-fourth in the nation is

not bad for the young Pitt cross
country team, which made its
national debut on Monday at Penn
State. '

Texas at El Paso received the
team honors through the strong
running of seven Kenyans- Wash«

ington State and Providence were.

‘second and third respectively; each
ﬁelded four foreign athletes. Penn
State, upset by Pitt. just two weeks

ago, put together a supereffort and -

ﬁnished fourth with the ﬁrst
entirely American team.
“Inexperience caught up _with

us," said Head Coach "Mike

Agostinella. “We were up against
the best in the nation. Many of the
athletes that are foreign will be
representing their countries in the
upcoming Olympics. .

“Mel _Boyd had’ an exceptional
race,-e along with Terry Wile, who
also ran very well. The other Pitt

Harriers did well, but inexperience
and the after-effects of coldsﬁlast
week _impeded a super
effort.”

No one onthe team had ever‘ 
been "to a meet of this caliber

before, although most of the team
will be back again next year -to try
to improve its national ranking.

backup talent in Bill Garver, Mark ‘ ‘

Boyd was the ﬁrst Pitt ﬁnisher,
placing 51st. Martin was 70th and
Wile was 129th. -

Because of the quality athletes a

WHYLWE A LIFE  
WITHOUT MEANING?

Too many of us are in places
we don’t want to’ be. Doing things
we really don’t want to be doing.
Sometimes, it’s because we can’t
think of anything better to do—but
that’s no way to live.

Since you have only one life to l

live, you might as well live it with
joy . . . with a feeling of satisfac-
tion and accom lishment . . . and
the knowledge t at you are giving,
not taking. Why not decide to live
for the best . . . for a great purpose
. . bfor something bigger than you
are.

If you want to change the di-
rection of your life, you might in-
vestigate the Paulist way of living.
The Paulists are a small group of
Catholic priests dedicated to preach-

r___

l

I THEMissionurics'to Modem America

ing the Gospel of Christ to the
American people. For over 100
years the Paulists have done this
through the communication arts-
books, publications, television and
radio—on college campuses, in par-
ishes, in missions in. the U.S., in
downtown centers, in working with
young and old. Because we are flex-
ible, we continually pioneer new
approaches. To do this we need
dicated, innovative men to carry
on our work. ‘ I
To find out what road God has
chosen us. to walk is one of the most
important tasks of our life.
VVhich road will be yours?
