Sinclair Lewis wrote in a style
which is mirrored in many of
the people which we meet today,
but nowhere did he come closer
to an accurate prediction of
things to come than in his book
"Arrowsmith.”-. For here at Pitt

most difficult

fact that not

Letter to the Editor . .

IF Members Answer ‘Big Six’ Walk-ou

EDITOR,
THE PITT NEWS:

' . An open letter to six frater-

nities: _ V

We of Interfraternity Council
feel that there are several perti-
nent items to the withdrawal of

six *-fraternities from Interfrater- '

nity Council, of which the stu-
dent body and even the members
of those six fraternities have not
been made aware.

“We do not and havenot at any
time opposed proportional rep-

‘ resentation to Council. To sev-

eral of us it would be a distinct

_advantage. The withdrawal was

not made by thelsix largest fra-

' ternities, but by the two largest

and 'four others whose size is
easily matchedxby several other
fraternities who did not with-
draw.

We opp_ose the method by
which the.proportional "represen-
tation plan was offered. It was
drawn, up by six fraternities
without consultation of any other
fraternities on the campus. -

We do oppose the unwilling-
ness of these six to pzfy dues to
Interfraternity Council in pro-
portion to their desired represen-
tation. The" amendment that the
dues be proportional was voted

’ down by all six in the Wednes-

day meeting.

We object to the unwillingness
of these six fraternities to com-
promise with the other fraterni-
ties concerned. The statement
had been made at the meeting
that they came “bound” by their
chapter to accept their proposal

Triumph Over Polio

it will be well nigh impossible
for many people tounderstand
why their families were struck
by polio .when they might have
been saved by an inoculation of
the new polio vaccine. Inocula-
tion will save some but‘ “con—
trolled” inoculation may save all.

This word “control” is [the
cause of bitterness in families
which are struck by polio. This ‘
year’s test will see some 500,000
second and third grade students
inoculated with the new polio

vaccine. ‘An equal number will
be given a similar looking but
ineffective solution.
the controls. 4
’ Case Histories Kept
Following the inoculations, ex-
acting histories will be kept on
all those who participated. Iden-
tical checks will be kept on both
. those who received the vaccine
and those who received the in-
effective solution for it is only
by an accurate cross check of
such results that the effectiveness
of the new vaccine can be deter-
mined. ‘

It is this new vaccine, and not
gamma globulin, which will ul-
timately wipe out the polio men-
ace as we know it today. Gamma
globulin, used for mass inocula-
tions last summer, offers only

gandi none other. ‘How can six
fraternities draw up. their own
demands and expect to achieve

them over twelve‘ other fraterni-
ties when they themselves are
unwilling to agree?

It is fairly obvious that this
situation has arisen over a recent
election in Interfraternity Coun-
cil. Ifthese fraternities were as
deeply concerned over their pro-
portional representation as they
profess, why did they. not pro-
pose it_before the election rather
than after the election. , The sit-
uation smells of ,“sour grapes!’

The walkout was not precipi-

tated Wednesday night.‘ It had .

been planned. The resolution to
withdraw had been drawn ahead
of time. In fact, a constitution of
the “Big Six?’ had been drawn
up prior to Wednesday’s meeting.
The walkout was deliberate, pre-

‘ meditated, and prompted by the

election.‘ Proportional represen-
tation Was the excuse.

Interfraternity Council -has -not
defeated their‘ proposal. We
merely referred it to a committee
where compromise and careful
consideration by" all concerned
will derive an acceptable propo-
sal.‘ The committee consists of
.Dean Biddle, Mr. Cunningham,
two members of small fraterni-

Gaarl Reason

These are

temporary protection since its
effectiveness disappears after ap-
proximately ﬁve weeks.

The trial vaccine now being
tested holds the key for perma-
nent protection against paralytic
polio. Because of the need for
strict controls, gamma globulin
will not be administered in areas
using this new vaccine. It will
be used, however, in other areas
of epidemic proportions.
Protection Still Limited

Until the results of the con-

,trolled tests of the new vaccine

have been tabulated, gamma
globulin will serve as the only

available protection against po-._
lio. The quantity of gamma glo- ‘

bulin to be made available will
be tripled this year but there is

still not enough for all the na- -

tion’s children. If the new vac-
cine proves effective, a limited
amount will be available during
1955, depending upon production
time ‘after the evaluation has
been completed. V’ ‘

No greater tribute is paid to
mankind than that given by the

bounded by the four walls of his’ .

ties, and two "members of. large
fraternities. In fact, a member of
a large fraternity is chairman.
This they wouldfnot accept.

, No steps have been taken by
Council against-these six. They
are competing in fraternity ath-
letics as if nothing had hap-.
pened. They have been given all
the privileges and none of the
responsibility of Interfraternity
Council. A motion to {prohibit
their competition in athletics is
tabled until the next meeting, in
hopes that an agreement can be

.made. Theirs is the next move.

When they walked out they left
the door open. No one has closed
it."

Let us hope fraternity men
can rise above petty bickering
and election bigotry. We hold no
hard. feelings at all. We hope to
see all six delegates at the next
Interfraternity Council meeting.

To Cheer

Interviews are being held now, and will continue dur-

ing Monday and Tuesday, for applicants for the cheer-
.l ading squad. These applicants may be either male _or fe-
ale. All candidates will be_ given equal consideration by
the interviewing team, which will consist of both faculty

and student members._ The applicants will attend- a general_
meeting next Week which will be a preliminary session to .

the actual training period. Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
will be at the meeting, as will several members of the

coaching staffs who will be coaches and advisors for the.

cheerleaders. .

It is good to know that the long meetings, the heated
discussions, and endless legislation are going to result in a
carefully planned and supervised program for male or fe-
male cheerleaders at the University of~Pittsburgh.

«orchids J to   56 Day

Congratulations are in order for the planners of last
Wednesday’s Student Government Day. It was well-run
and informative and proved that such an event has a deﬁn-
ite place in student politics here. It also proved that the
program oﬁered is a must if we intend. to have an informed
and well oriented student government. The cooperation and
interest displayed by the persons who attended was a heart-
ening sign to those who are really interested in student

_ government, itsposition, and its future course at Pitt.

Riflcmen Shoot
Wl/U for Title

If the third time is lucky,
as they say, the Pitt riﬂe team

ought to be _the new champs
of the Greater‘ Pittsburgh Riﬂe
League by Saturday night.

More than luck will be needed,
however, tobeat the West Virginia
sharpstoorers who have edged out
the local riﬂemen thepast two
years in shootoff matches to take
the crown.

The two teams split the season
series to force the tie which is
slated to be broken "at the neutral
W&J range. The Mounties hand-
ed Pitt its only loss in nine match-
es, and Sgt. Bob ~Davidson’s
marks_men returned the favor last
Saturday. \

West Virginia has copped the
GPRL title all three years since
the loop’s inception’.

Probable ﬁrers on the Pitt line
will be Torn Shepard, Dave Jacob-

of what is in store for the Panther nine, it spells just one

word-—trouble.

Last year also found the Mittmen opening in the south-

lands against service teams. They
captured the lidlifter from the At-
lantic Fleet Amphibious Force,
and then lost ‘three straight games
-—-two to the Norfolk Naval Base
and the other to Fort Eustis.
Although the. Panthers have
seven regulars returning, they will
be at a disadvantage in that Quan-

tico will have played several
games before meeting Sarge’s
crew. -

' The fate of the team appears to
ride on the strong right arms of
pitching aces Don Shanafelt and
Don Miller. If the boys are able
to come through with'top-notch

performances, the Mittmen could

come home with the victories.
Together with the veterans, last
year’s reserves, and the newcom-
ers, Coach Mitterling hopes_'the
boys will have the spark to” get
off on the right foot.
“Should they be able to down

the Quanticonine,” he said, “it
will build up the players’ morale
and help them in their drive to
gain a spot in the NCAA playoﬁfs.”
Then he added, “It won’t takeus
long to-"ﬁnd ou.t what we have.”
