(Nagy Says U. S. Can
ll/}Use Sino - Soviet Rift
To ‘Liberate’ Satellites

by BERNI McLEOD

Twenty-two years after,

World War II, the U.S. .once
again has a chance to help
East-Central Europe. Ac-
cording to Ference’ Nagy,
former Prime Minister of

Hungary and guest speaker at
Wednesday’s SU Public Affairs

 
   

VDR.  H. PEAKE
Defends Academic Freedom

lecture, the fate of the Russian
Satellites is in US hands.

Tracing the Soviet take-over in
Eastern Europe, Nagy discussed
the post-war Russian inﬁltration

_ which the US was unprepared to

stop. Nagy now feels that because
of Sino-Soviet tension, and the

. ’”_?,ecline of communist popularity,

we are now in a position to ne-
gotiate with Russia for the eco-
nomic freedom of her satillites.
,Communist control, according
to Nagy, began in East-Central
Europe after 1945, when com-
munist leaders, exiled during the
1920’s returned with the occupy-
ling Soviet army. With Russian
support they formed coalition
governments, took over the most
important cabinet jobs, and es-
tablished police forces.
US diplomatic indecisiveness,
said Nagy, made occupation agree-
ments quite vague, and helped

, Soviet power to take root.lWhen _

Hungary ﬁnally had an election,

..  only 17 per cent of the voters
supported the communists, the

Russians eliminated the popular
leaders by political ‘arrests. Com-
munist control was severe and
ruthless.

It was not a matter of any
great conﬂict between traditional
and contemporary art or even of
academic freedom that led to the
Univers_ity’s recent severence of
relations with Helen Clay Frick.
According to Joseph Colangelo,
director of public relations for
the University, the conﬂict was
“Who would -have ultimate con-
trol over the Frick Building and
the ﬁne arts department, and the
faculty.”

Colangelo noted that “she (Miss
Frick) wanted some inﬂuence
over faculty and other personnel
in the ﬁne arts department and
the humanities.” Dr. Charles

(HUAC, the power to investigation

Opposition
Beaten 64-6
At Debate

by FRAN GLICKSMAN

By a vote of 64-6, it was re-
solved that the University should
not give student names to the
House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUAC), Defending
this stand at a recent debate
sponsored by -the William Pitt
Debate Union (WPDU), John Rus-
key insisted that “the protection
aﬁorded to the faculty and stu-
dents in classrooms must be ex-

tended to all areas, especially ~

student activities.”

Ruskay questioned academic
freedom and the role of a univer-
sity. “A university must lead a
society. It must challenge and
study "new ideas, focusing on the
borders of new knowledge. Aca-
demic freedom must be unham-
pered and unharrassed.”

Alan Disler led the opposition
by pointing out the legitimacy of
HUAC as a committee in Con-
gress. The committe has the pow-
investigation. He added
that “Regardless of the constitu-
tionality of the committee, this
University must not be he one
to defy it.” ’ -

Armand Belly, following Rus-
kay’s argument, insisted that

“questioning free society vio-

lates our basic rights as Ameri-
cans.” He continued by describ-
ing the sole object of HUAC 
exposure and punishment used
to intimidate others.

A “Un-American is everything Mr.
Poole (chairman of HUAC) and
his committee think Un-Ameri-
can.” Belly insisted that we need
freedom in an academic environ-
ment. “Johnson and the United’
States can put down rebellion,
but not ideas. If Harvard and
Columbia refuse to cooperate
with this committee, so should
we.

Jon Meyers then spoke oppos-
ing the proposition to release
names. He insisted that our gov-
ernmentpmust protect the people.
He pointed out the legitimacy of

that Miss Frick had presented de- 

mands through her lawyer to
exert “complete control over the

building and have a decisive

voice in a number of faculty ap-

. pointments. . _
“This conﬂict with Miss Frick‘

has been going on for two; or
three years or more,” continued

"Peake. He added that “every ef-

fort to reach a satisfactory com-
promise came to naught because
of her insistence on ultimate au-

and humanities classes alone.

This agreement was upheld last A

year when a class in sociology,
which is in the social science
area, had to be rescheduled from
the Frick Building to another.

An article in Wednesday’s is-"A

sue of the Pittsburgh Press main-
tained that Miss Frick intended
the Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts
Building, which she gave as a
gift to the University, to be used
as a museum. But Colangelo
noted that in the original ‘agree-
ment, the building was “certain-
ly to be used for classrooms.”-
Dr. Peake commented that Miss
Frick’s gift was “not to be a mu-
seum as such.”

“The building is not designed a

as a museum—this is very evi-
dent—but as a teaching building
for the ﬁne arts department with
several gallery areas,” continued
Peake.

One consequence of the break ‘

in relations with Miss Frick will
be the loss of revenues for main-
tenance of the building. This did
not appear to bother University
officials too much. Colangelo-
notedthat the loss of millions pre-
dicted in another Press article is

Permission

A slight addition to the wom-
en’s curfew system has just been
announced by the Housing Board
of the Associated Women (AWS).

The new rules will include a
mid-week overnight permission.
All girls will be able to stay out
of the dormitory overnight for
any school night (Monday-Thurs-
day) or may use a mid-week over-
night to leave early for the week-
end. S ’

Previously, this could only be
done by special permission from
the Director of Women’s Hous-
ing. The Housing Board feels
that this mid-week overnight po-
licy is a necessary step because
of the student “stand-by” policy
on the airlines, as well as the oc-
casions that arise for job inter-
views or family emergencies.

If a girl wishes to take mid.
weeks in succession, she is asked
to notify her Head Resident and
the girls are reminded that any
Cutting of classes is up to the
discretion of the students. Let-
ters of explanation‘ are being
sent to the parents along with
permission cards which should

‘be signed and returned immedi-

ately so this policy may be effec.
tive as soon as possible.

C’ Campus Membership Lists

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS) —
The staff director of the House
Un-American Activities Commit-
tee (HUAC) denied that the ‘Com-
mittee had ever subpoenaed mem-
bership lists of campus organiza-

. tions opposed to the war in Viet-

nam.
" Committee director Francis B.
McNamara said in an interview
that the “official applications for
campus recognition” of student
groups at Stanford University, the
University of Michigan, the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley,
and Haverford College were sub-
poenaed prior to last spring’s hear-
ings on the so-called “Pool bill.”
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Joe _

. Pool (D-Tex.) would have made it

illegal to send aid to the enemy
or interfere with military troop
and material movements during a
period of undeclared war. It passed
the House but did not receive Sen-
ate action. '
McNamara said HUAC was not
interested in lists of general mem-
bership, ‘since most members

‘ .would not have the knowledge of

‘\‘_.a'

activities in which the Committee
was interested.

Those groups whose applica-
tions were subpoenaed were re-
portedly engaged in activities
which would haveibeen made il-
legal under the “Pool bill.”

At present, McNamara stated,
HUAC has no hearings planned
involving campus groups.

The subpoenas of the applica-
tions lists at the four schools be-
cause of the “Pool bill” caused a
furor within the academic com-
munity.

During November, the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
sent a letter to 900 college and

b university presidents urgingthem

to resist‘ HUAC ‘subpoenas “in
every possible legal manner.”

In January, the U.S. National
Student Association (NSA) an-
nounced it was sending a letter

to all university presidents and
student body presidents support-
ing the ACLU statement. The NSA
mailing also includes a resolution
of the 18th National Student Con-
gress calling on NSA member
schools to work for HUAC’s abo-
lition.

NSA charged the Committee
with a record of “sensational, un-
fair, and destructive public ex-
posure (and) action as a judge
and jury without giving individ-
uals the protection of judicial due
process.”

The ACLU called the “Pool bill”

_ subpoenas “one of the most seri-

ous breaches of academic free-
dom of students in recent decades,
not excluding the McCarthy era.”

As a result of the subpoenas,
the University of Michigan stu-
dent government council abolished
a rule requiring the filing of mem-
bership lists with the Office of Stu-

' dent Affairs.

Responding to the ACLU’s call,
administrators at the City College
of New York, ‘Duke'University, the
University of Minnesota, and the
University of Pennsylvania‘ have
stated they will not send any lists
to HUAC.

University of Chicago Dean of
Students Warner Wick said his
school would not be able to re-
spond to subpoenas since member-
ship lists were not kept on file.

Ed. note—Th'e CPS bulletin con-
cluded with the statement: “At
the Unversity of Pittsburgh,

_ however, the administration has

announced it will comply with
any H UAC requests. Student ral-
lies against the policy have taken
place without success.” However,
Chancellor Kurtzman has made
no definite stand concerning the
possible subpoena of student mem-
bership lists, and to our knowl-
edge, no student demonstrations
have taken place.

  UCLA Supplement Suspended

LOS ANGELES, Calif. (CPS)-—

-The weekly literary supplement

of UCLA’s Daily Bruin, the stu-
dent newspaper, was suspended
from publication following pres-
sure from local officials who pro-
tested the reproduction of a pic-
ture of a nude woman and an
accompanying article which was
run in the Jan. 18 issue of the
paper.

The picture, appearing in the
supplement Intro, drew criticism
from several Los Angeles County
supervisors, local newspapers and
two UCLA students, who say
they ‘vill sue for discontinuance
of the Daily Bruin.

The picture, drawn by the Ger-
' man artist George Grosz, drew

violent reaction from the Ger-
man government in 1923 when it
was ﬁrst exhibited. The govern-
ment imposed a ﬁne on Grosz
and ordered that his exhibition
be dismantled.
The decision to suspend Intro
was passed unanimously in an
emergency meeting of the stu-
dent Communications Board,
which called for a policy study
committee to set up guidelines
to insure the independence of
student publications. The board
announced that it found nothing
wrong with the article but sus-
pended publication partly be-
cause of recent political pressure
--by conservatives to investigate
the university.

The board reached its decision
after almost ﬁve hours in execu-
tive session with Daily Bruin edi-
tor Neil Reichline, Intro editor
Digby Diehl, Daily Bruin advi-
sor James Howard, and UCLA
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.

The policy study will hold open
hearings to consider what ma-
terial can be considered accept-
able for Intro with respect to the
readership of the Daily Bruin.

Editor Neil Reichline said that

WATERLOO, Canada (CPS) —
Protests against the American Se-

the Canadian border last week as
the student council of the Univers-
ity of Waterloo passed a resolu-
tion authorizing its “official rep-
resentatives” to gives what assist-
ance they can to young men ﬂee-

The Waterloo student council
joined a growinglist of Canadian

so come from university faculty
members. Almost 360 faculty mem-
bers of the University of Toronto
signed a petition to Prime Minis-
ter Lester Pearson asking for a
ban of arms sales to the United
States until the U.S. is out of
Vietnam.

The petition calls on the Ca-
nadian government to demand an
end. to U.S. bombing in Viet Nam
and to ‘reveal all military produc-
tion contracts related in any way
to the Vietnam war . . . and to
refuse to sell arms to the U.S.
until this intervention ceases.”

Four university professors, in-
cluding professor of English Peter

. Hughes, the organizer of the pe-
.tition, stated their case to’ the

cause “the Communications Board
was pressured by the situation of
the’ university ltoday. Keeping
this in mind,” he added, “I sup-
pose their decision was a wise
one.” ,

The Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors became involved
in the Intro controversy when it
decided to refer the Intro article
to‘ the County Anti-Obscenity
Commission and to send copies
of that edition to the president
of the Board of Regents and to
the governor’s office.

One member of the Board of
Supervisors, Warren Dorn, ex-
pressed his disapproval of the
article and compared it to an
exhibit at the Los Angeles Coun-
ty Art Museum last year. Dorn
had vehemently denounced the
exhibit, a presentation of modern
art sculpture by Edward Kien-
holz which included sculptures
of old cars and of couples pet-
ting. As a result of Dom’s ob-
jections, the exhibit was a great
success and attracted thousands
of viewers, according to the Dai-
lyBruin.

Several students have said that
the actions of the Board of Su-
pervisors and the attacks by lo-
cal papers were prompted by the
recent ﬁring of University of Cali-
fornia President Clark Kerr.
Kerr's dismissal was interpreted
as a victory by conservative gov-
ernor Ronald Reagan who had
made “New Left” activity at the
University a major issue in his
campaign.

Reagan had stressed concern
throughout his campaign for the
moral tone of the country which,
he said, had deteriorated in re-
cent years. The university had
ﬁgured strongly in this appeal
when Reagan" speciﬁcally called
upon Governor Edmund Brown

to hold public hearings on charges
that a Vietnam Day Committee
dance at Berkeley last spring had
become an “orgy” of drug-taking.
and sex.

Following his dismissal, Clark
Kerr issued a statement saying
that one of the major achieve-
ments of his administration was
the assurance of student free-
dom of expression, especially for
student publications.

The governor, after seeing a.
copy of Intro, was reported on a
televisions news program as be-
ing “inarticulate with rage." Rea-
gan said that “anybody who
would print anything like this
(Grosz’s picture) is sick.”

Intro editor Diehl said that he s - ’

plans to ﬁght for the rights‘ of
students to speak and act free-
ly.

Diehl charged that the uproar
against Intro represents a politi-
cal. “invasion of the sanctity of
the university.” .He added that
the article was printed by “ma-
ture, serious and informed stu-
dents.”

Diehl said that those who ob-
jected to the article are “naive."
“I can’t believe that they have

read any literature of this. cen- .

tury.” Several students reported
that members of the art depart-
ment ﬁnd the attacks on the .is-
sue “laughable.”

Bu not all UCLA students seem,
to agree with the art department.
Two students have ﬁled suit with
the Los Angeles superior court
to prevent the Daily Bruin from
publishing what they call “ﬁlth
and pornography.” The ‘suit is
directed toward Chancellor Frank-
lin Murphy.

The two students, Alan Bock

and J eraldine Anderson, said that
objectionable material in the Dai-

ly Bruin “has a tendency to gen-
erate in the minds of the general
public a belief that students at
UCLA are lewd and dissolute.”

Bock and Anderson, who an-
nounced their intended suit in
a press conference, said they not
only objected to the Intro issue
but they also cited an Oct. 14,
1966, column by J. Akin which
appeared on the Daily Bruin edi-
torial page under the headline
“Sex and Christianity.” The arti-
cle, the petitioners said, is one
which “the Christian religion was
held up to ridicule.” ,

Diehl charged that the two-
students, who are both members
of the Young Republicans Club,
made their announcement in an

expensive hotel which, he said,"

could only have been paid for by

the Republican organization.
Diehl added that the protestors

seem to be acting as “agents of

Mayor (Sam) Yorty to bring po- .

litical pressure on the students
of the university, which the stu-
dents resent greatly. '

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles
County Attorney’s office, which
has reviewed the case, has re-
ported that there is probably no:
legal action that can be taken
against the student newspaper,
in light of recent freedom of the
press decisions.

. Ribicoff Re-introduces

Student Tax Credit Bill

WASHINGTON, D.C., (CPS) -—
A bill to provide income tax cred-
it of up to $325 for college students
and their parents was re-intro-
duced in the Senate Monday by
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.).

The proposal, co-sponsored. by
4(_3 senators, is opposed by several
major education associations, in-
cluding the National Association of
State Universities and Land-Grant
Colleges and the Association of
State Colleges and Universities.

L Ribicoff’s bill would allow a 75
per cent income tax credit on the
first $200 of tuition, fees, books,
and supplies. This means that if
one paid $200 tuition, $150 could
be deducted from the individual’s
net income tax bill. The next $300
would be lessened by a 25 per cent
credit, allowing another $75 in de-
ductions from the tax due, -while a
10. Per cent credit, or up to.$100,

The Connecticut senator’s pro-
posal this year is slightly changed
from those he has introduced in
previous sessions of Congress. For
the first time, it gives coverage
to students in accredited post-sec-
ondary business, trade, technical
and other vocational sehools.

two-thirds of the benefits under
his bill would go to families earn-

Pitt Coaching

Editor: The Pitt News

The best possible finish to the
current disappointing" basketball
season wouldtbe to replace Coach
Bob Timmons with Freshman
Coach Tim Grgurich. The reasons
for the change are both plentiful
and obvious. Since he’ began
coaching at Pitt, Mr. Grgurich
has recruited fine teams, and they
have compiled excellent records.
If he is not elevated to the position

Illllllllllllllll

of headcoachl soon, _.he will cer- P
tainlybe offerred a’simi1aI_?jposi- .-

tion somewhere else. It would cer-
tainly be a shame to lose such ﬁne
talent. C

Bob Timmons, on the other hand
lacks all of the qualities of a
good coach. He has never been
much of a recruiter. The list of
boys he lost to other schools was
always more impressive than the
list of players he convinced to
come here. The record of M.r.
Timmon’s’ coaching and instruc-
tion over the past three years can
only be described as horrendous.

One of the best results of the’
coaching change would be a‘ prob-

able increase in support for our,

basketball team. I have missed
few games in the last three years.
So few of these varsity games
have been truly exciting that I

cannot blame anyone for staying

down in the dormatories. Win or

lose, the freshmen under Tim Gr.- _

gurich almost always electrify the
crowd throughout the game.

I consider the coaching change
a critical part of the new image
of Pitt sports that Dave Hart has
begun. Bob Timmons is an ana-

chronism from the -"era of Michel-‘

osen. It’s time_to make college
-basketball here the fast, exciting
sport it has become elsewhere.

critically needs to enlarge its sparse endowment funds, and§l\/liss Frick
could possibly been one of the source’s of a sizeable private aid from local

philanthropists. It was the hope of the University to continue to attract this
sort of private aid from local philanthropists as a state—related institution.

But the cost of Miss Frick’s friendship had obviously grown to be too

great. No institution of higher learning could have kept its self respect and
accepted the conditions that ‘apparently came with ‘Miss Frick’s financial
contributions. It would have been folly for us to submit to a situation

The University action was a heroic one when considered. in light of

the terrific financial pressures that are still with us. Ultimately we can

RECENTLY, I had the
pleasure of having an intri-
guing discussion with a
friend of mine. Our talk cen-
tered on our respective goals
in like. Taking a very alarm-
ing position, my friend re-
vealed that he was bored
with college.

“I just can’t wait until I
go to a professional school,”

he told __,me_ “I’m not really .
‘ ihteresthd in any’prof.*ss‘s1on,

you know. But-I can’t wait
until I become a professional
man. Then I can get out into

the ‘world and ‘make some-

money.”

I was extremely affected
by my friend’s opinion. To
me, it reﬂects an obvious
trend in our society. Many
people will not readily ad-
mit that the attainment of
wealth is their primary mo-

»tive in life. Yet, in reality,"

these ‘people are constantly
thinking of how they can
“get rich quick.”

IT IS indeed a pity that
the “get rich quick” syn-
drone is clearly representa-
tive at the University. This
goal-oriented syndrone is in
many ways injurious to the
individual student. '

To me, the primacy to
“get rich quick” is the chief
cause underlying the wide-
spread cheating at the Uni-
versity. In many individual
cases the drive to “get rich

quick” takes priority over-

other drives. This extreme
priority causes the student
to prostitute his scruples:
Those who prostitute their
scruples would argue that
the “ends justify the means.”
Consequently, they would
feel no guilt while cheating
on a test because in their
minds the actions involved
in cheating are considered
means. Therefore, cheating
would be justiﬁed. ‘ ‘
To be sure, cheating not
only causes the student to
prostitute his‘ scruples but
constitutes a harm “to the
University. Last week, "the
Liberal Arts Cabinet reveal-

ed the results of its survey

concerning a proposed honor

   

  The Primary Goal

“Get Rich X Quick”

established, the incentive to
cheat would have to be abol-
ished.” Essentially, the Lib-
eral Arts Cabinet was op-
posed to an honor code be-
cause they felt that the stu-
dent body of the University
lacked the incentive to abol-
ish cheating, which can be

_ directly related to the prima-

cy of getting rich.” _
THE WIDESPREAD

._ cheating, which results from‘

the “get rich quick” syn-
drome, is harmful in still an-
other way——it hinders the
educational process. Those
who cheat care nothing about
their education. To them, ed-

ucation is solely a tool to ‘-

their material success. These
individuals create a poor en-
vironment for educational
progress and excellence.
Unfortunately, the saddest
and most alarming manifes-
tation of the “get rich syn-
drome” is that those individ-

-uals who believe in it ulti-

mately destroy themselves,
In many cases, these individ-
uals lose sight of what is
right and wrong. They even-
tually become unhappy’ in

.life. I think that it is not

obvious enough that the
goal to “get rich quick” is a
shallow one and that those

be most gratified by the fact that no one can ever doubt the academic in-
tegrity of our institution. ..

by Paul Stoller

students who adhere to this
sightless philosophy will
tend to lead‘shallow lives.

“ It would be foolish to state
that One should completely
forget about the materialis-
tic aspects of life because
the basic tenets of our so-
ciety would not permit this.
But I think it is imperative-
that the goal-orientation to
“get rich quick” should not
be the primary. motive ‘in
our lives. -

THERE ARE a number
of. other goals which can
bring the individual great
satisfaction and happiness.
Many professors who are cer-
tainly not among the high-
est paid _professional men,
receive great pleasures and
satisfactions from the art of
instruction. Moreover, men
who devote their lives to
helping others are perhaps

the happiest and most satis- 

ﬂed of individuals.
There are higher and

worthier pleasures than be-—

ing wealthy. As Plato wrote,
“The highest pleasure that
man can attain is mental

. tranquility — or happiness.

When man achieves this, he
becomes the best that he
can become.”

WeekendConcert

Was ‘Experience’

Editor, The Pitt News:

For those who went, there is
no need to describe it. For those
who didn’t, I ﬁnd it impossible
to put into words. The Winter
Weekend Concert with the Temp-
tations was an experience.

The Thursday night excitement
started early when the students
entered the door and received a
program. On the front of the
program in large letters next to
the Pitt seal were the words:

University of Pittsburgh

of the Commonwealth System

of Higher Education.
It was the ﬁrst time this new
title had ever been seen in print.
It started one thinking.

Before the start of the concert,
the King and Queen: Jim Flani-.
gen and Sue Moudy were crown-
ed. Once more faith placed in
the popular voted proved well

» founded.

Fifteen minutes later the cur-
tains opened and the Happen-
ings performed. And nothing
happened.

Then came the main attraction.
No matter how much you had
heard about the Temptations,
you couldn’t have been prepared
for the concert they put on. It was
utterly fantastic. Their rhythm
and precision were something to
behold. In the middle of the con-
cert, the show was delayed by
extended applause. The partially
ﬁlled hall of 2,000 students echoed
with the applause of 10,000.Nev-
er was so much entertainment
enjoyed so profusely by so few.

After one of their songs, a
me1_nL~e- of the Temptations step-
ped forward to thank the audi-
ence for their great response.

Then someone in the third bal-'

cony yelled back, “We’ve got
soul.” With that the place went
wild. When the ‘concert contin-
ued, there were actually people
dancing in the aisles. As the ex-
citement mounted, it was all the
audience could do to remain in
their seats. They clapped in uni-

son ‘and sang along- with the
group.

The time went far too fast and
soon the curtain was closing. The
students then started applauding.
The stage went dim. and the
house lights went on but the ap-
plause continued. Soon everyone
in the hall was standing and ap-
plauding, yelling and chanting.
This standing ovation continued
for at least ‘five minutes until
the curtains opened again and
the Temptations sang for a few

more minutes.

During the applause, I had
slipped backstage where there
was mass confusion. Doors were
being barracaded and men were
being assigned positions at the
doors to kep the crowd out. When
they ﬁnished, the Temptations
literally ran off stage to their
dressing room. The door was
locked behind them.

'Then came the onslaught of
students. At ﬁrst a few got back-
stage, then a few more. Soon
those students backstage were
holding the doors to keep others
out. One student yelled to the
others, “Keep those doors shut.
These people are crazy.” He fail-
ed to realize that the only dif-
ference between them and him
was that they were on the other
side of the door.

Five minutes passed, then ten
and some students gave up and
left. The crowd outside was sub-
siding. Meanwhile, I had been
talking to their drummer who is
not actually one of the Tempta-
tions. When he told me that this
sort of thing happens after every
one of their concerts, I should
have realized that an escape had
been planned. A few minutes
later the door opened and the

students rushed into the dressing
room. Cold air from the room
ﬁlled the halfway. The window
was open and the Temptations
were gone.

Those who went will agree that
this was the ﬁnest concert Pitt
has ever had" and, to say the
least, an exciting evening. For
those who didn’t go, it will be
weeks before their friends stop
talking about the Winter Week-
end concert with the Tempta-

tions.

an extreme inconvenience, and
I am hoping that this year I can
receive all my mail. I am posi-
tive that I am not the only mem-
ber of the student body to have
had a smilar experience. I also

feel that it might be very inter-

esting to hear from these other
people; their loses and their sub-
sequent actions to retrieve these
losses.

Frick Influence ‘Dang

(Continued from Pagel)
plant, said that the University
has no plans about the rooms. He
seemed to indicate, however, that
money would ultimately be found
to ﬁnish the rooms.

The total paid by Miss Frick
for the building in the last ﬁscal
year was $135,000. But, only $60,-
000 of this total went for actual
maintenance of the building. The
rest, according to Dr. Kurtzman,
paid salaries of the extra secur-
ity guards Miss Frick insisted on
keeping in the building and of
others.

Another result of the sever-
ence of relations was the dismis-

sal of Professor Emeritus Walter '

Read Hovey as director of the
Fine Arts Building. Hovey, who
retired from the faculty three
years ago after: reaching the man-
datory retirement age, was the
personal choice of Miss Frick for
the position. She was personally
paying the salaries of Hovey and
Virginia Lewis, assistant director
01‘ the buildingand another choice
of Miss Frick. Dr. Peake noted
that Miss Frick had not paid any
money at all since the end of the
last ﬁscal year for maintenance
of the building or for salaries of
personnel. ,

Peake emphasized that Hovey
has nottechnically been severed
from the ﬁne arts department at
all but retains his position as
professor emeritus. The position
Hovey left as director of the
building will not be reﬁlled, ac-

   

), .

cording to Colangelo. Instead, the
offices of the ﬁne arts department
will be moved into the building,
probably next year. .

Colangelo further noted that
Miss Lewis will keep her faculty
post in the ﬁne arts department
as professor of art history.

Dr. William Loerke, chairman
01 the ﬁne arts department, said
Wednesday, that “the basic prob-
lem was the reasonable use of
her gifts in an academic way."
Miss Frick’s proposals, remarked
Loerke, always carried a variety
of restrictions. -

“We were given to understand
that we must soft pedal—-if not

ignore and eliminate outright——
contemporary art,” said Loerke.

Loerke added that since “aca-
demic integrity” was restored, he
hoped to recruit more faculty.
Colang-elo also noted that “the
continued inﬂun-ece of Miss Frick

would have been dangerous to.

the integrity of the University.

Starting Monday, said Dr.
Loerke, most of the art history
courses currently held in other
buildings will be moved to the
Frick structure. After ﬁne arts
classes are scheduled, commented
Loerke, the office of student rec-
ords will be free to schedule
classes from other disciplines
there. “The chief advantage of

Frick Building is pictured above.

   

. FRICK FINE ARTS Building Director, Walter Read

Hovey, who has just lost his Unive

moving classes to the building
now,” Loerke added, “is that it
will make scheduling easier in
the fall, when there will be a big
rush.”
Because of this entire conflict,
Miss Frick is likely to remove
“some of the works she has loan-
ed to the University. These in-
clude many of the paintings on
display‘ in the Frick Building.
Also, antique paneling "from a
house in ‘Paris that adorns the
“French Room” of the building,
several Fragonard panels, and
some French furniture probably
will be removed. Loerke said,
however, that Miss Frick’s “real-
ly outstanding gift,” the Fine
Arts Library, is a permanent gift
and will no-t be affected.

: Pages -— THE Prrr NEWS — Friday, February 10, 1967

Friend of Photographer

Posvar Recollected

by GEORGE E. CONDON

‘ The following story appeared in
the Feb. 1 edition of the Cleve-
land Plain Dealer.

Among the newsworthy devel-
opments around the nation in
the past week was the appoint-
ment of Col. Wesley W. Posvar,
USAF, as chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. .

Andy Kraffert would have been
tickled by the news.

A Some people will remember An-
drew Levand Kraffert as one of

the really remarkable men in the
ﬁeld of newspaper photography.
He was a cameraman in Cleve-
years,
from 1901 to 1953—-45 of those
years with the Plain Dealer.

’ Chancellor Posvar indubitably
remembers Andy Kraffert as the
big, gentle, lonely man who help-
ed to start him on his way to-
ward present eminence.

Andy’s wife died in 1945. Their
marriage had been childless, and
Andy went to live in ‘a hotel

I room. It was not much of an ex-

istence, and everybody who knew

lhim was cheered when, in time,

the large man who always walk-
ed as if his feet were killing him
became a boarder in the home of
the Posvar family at 1278 W.
160th Street. The Posvars were
old friends. Capt. Vladimir Pos-
var of the Air Force once had

been a reporter for the Cleve-
" land News and his journalistic

path often had crossed Andy

Kraffert’s.

Everybody around the Plain

’Dealer knew how grateful Andy

was to ﬁnd a home with the Pos-
var family because he talked
about them all the time. When a
reporter was out on an assign-

- ment with Kraﬁert, he could ex-

pect to hear what wonderful peo-

. ' ‘ple the Posvars were, and what
.2. _a bright young fellow that Wes-

ley was.

Andy never let anybody for-
get that back in 1943, Wesley

, . Posvar had been in -the West
‘High School graduating class. He

was class Valedictorian. But An-
dy hardly ever spoke of his own
inﬂuential role in helping the

‘boy to win an appointment to"

the Military Academy by United
States Senator Robert A.‘ Taft, an
old friend of Andy’s.

From that point on, though, it
seemed as if Andy Kraﬁert lived
enly to bask in the reflected glory
of Wesley Posvar’s accomplish-
ments. When Posvar emerged as
the top man in his class of 75,
at West Point in June, 1946, old
Andy could not restrain himself.
He shuttled around the Plain
Dealer's editorial 0ﬁ'ices, tugging
every sleeve he could ﬁnd and
demanding that all his colleagues
listen to the great news.

From that time on, it was one
bulletin after another on the
young man’s progress.

“Did you hear the latest on
Wesley?” Andy would ask, and
then he would hasten "to tell you
what it was, never waiting for
your reply. And so the people at
the Plain Dealer came to know
Wesley Posvar as well, possibly,

as they knew anyone. They knew-

when he was named a Rhodes
Scholar and they were quick to
hear of his appointment to the
faculty of the military academy
at the age of 26. They heard of
all the young man’s achievements
and of all his promotions—and,
of course, they heard the great
news from Andy when Wesley
married a former West High
School classmate, Mildred Muel-
ler, in 1950. From that day on,
they heard a lot about Mildred,
too, as she moved to the top as
Mildred Miller of the Metropoli-
tan Opera Co.

Andy died in 1958, a very tired
84, but he was still talking about
his boy, Wesley, right to the very
end. He would have been beside
himself if he had lived to hear
the big news last week.

“I know how to pick them,”
old Andy used to say.

He did, too. He's the man who
picked Wesley Posvar as a win-
ner.

the new atmosphere, are trying to
develop good relations with the
US and the West, to help elevi-
ate oppressing conditions caused
by the Soviets.

Satellite "countries realize that

the US can aid them most eco-
nomically. “Satellites do not want
to be politically independent,”
emphasized Nagy. “They need
Moscow's protection. However,
Soviet economic exploitation is.
brutal. Russia sells their goods to
Eastern Europe at high prices
and pays little for their’s in re-
turn. From 1955 to 1964, Rus-
sia’s illegal proﬁt was 13 billion
dollars.”
_ According to Nagy, the US can
greatly help the satellites when
Russia, pressed by economic trou-
ble and China, tries to bide peace
with the West. We, in turn,
should bring up Soviet control in
Eastern Europe.

Opposition
Massacred

(Conltimieil from Page 1)
is self-evident and the fact that
the University cannot afford this
publicity.

In the rebuttal, Belly empha-
sized that “any university needs
the free ﬂow of ideas which
HUAC limits.” He stated that
free speech and thought are neces-
sary to prevent a despotic society.
“HUAC is not necessary because
it can’t legislate on propaganda.
HUAC only tries to punish
names.”

Graduat~eStudentsForm
Social Organization

by BERNI McLEOD

The ﬁrst time graduate stu-
dents banded together, they ran
candidates for winter week-end
king and queen last year and
won. This phenomenal success
gave them the idea of a penna-
nent organization.

This Saturday night in a kick-
off dance in the Student Union,
the Graduate Social Organization
will offer the ﬁrst of a series of
programs. Ful_ly recognized by
the Allocations Committee and
aided by the SUB, and GSO is
prepared to undertake a program
for helping graduate students
meet ‘each other and feel more
a part of University life.

President of the new organi-
zation is John T. Smith, a grad-
uate student in counselor educa-
tion and a former Pitt under-
graduate. Smith, along with his
vice-president, Ed. McCormick,
also in counselor education, and
GSO secretary Marian Kreiger,
outlined a constitution and ar-
ranged for the upcoming events.

“Graduate students, seem very
enthusiastic about the idea,” said
Smith. Of course, We will ﬁnd out

Saturday by the turn-out. The
dance, to be held from 9 p.m. to
midnight. will cost $1.50, and the
sum will entitle the student to
membership in GSO.

“Hopefully, with one uniﬁed
organization,” added Miss Krieg—
er, “we vwill be able to coordi-
nate graduate activities.”

When polling an “average”
graduate student as to what he
thought of the new organization,
John Lutness, a masters of busi-
ness administration candidate,
replied: ‘‘It sounds pretty good;

Another Day

Trees Pool Nutures

Breed of its Own

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllIIIIIllllIllIIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIII

-If someone were to analyze Jerry Snyder’s dreams, he
might find himself in the secret world of Walte-r Nitty. At
one moment Snyder is standing on the lane rimming Trees

Pool. Then, in a flash, you can picture him centered in the _

Roman Coliseum. .

The Coliseum is overﬂowing with hungry fans, On the
floor of the Roman stadium are a dozen gladiators. Then,
just as quick, you’re backat Trees Pool. The stands are
empty, the pool is empty, and Snyder, the
interim swimming coach, keeps on talking.

“Remember, Rio-me wasn’t built in_ a day.

facilities in the East. With what We have,
Pitt should be an Eastern contender but we
have to get the horses first and the admin-
istration has to-decide exactly what type of
program they want.” _ - ' "
Snyder, in his early twenties, was hand-

 

.. .

-Grady resigned. Besides his current worries

‘ concerning the team and recruits, he is also sweating out

his status. He wants his title changed from interim to per-
manent and indications that he deserves the recognition and
that he will get it. -

If ‘nothing else, Snyder has done Wonders in terms of
team spirit, '

At the beginning of the season he posted a sign on the
locker room door which read, “Morale is not put on like a
coat. You build it -day by day.”

‘ “I told them,” continues Snyder, “to cheer for the guys

‘ V in .the pool.”

He’d make a great .adv_isor.-t0._the,cheerléaders judging

i on the vocal "performance of his teams during the home
meets. Some of that vocal energy will probably pay divi-*'

dends because the swimmers have a chance to be the only
varsity team this winter with a winning record.

vWhat Snyder is attempting is the simple task of build-
ing a team and a tradition, upon a very sandy foundation.
Spirit was an unknown commodity at the conclusion of last
year in Trees Pool. Snyder was also greeted upon his arrival

by the missing link~no freshman team. -

Another problem also confronts Snyder and the swim-
ming program. That is the fact that swimming below the
Olympic training level is a far from glorious sport. ’

As Snyder says, “Swimming is something which can
become very monotol-lous_ It’s like track—an_ individual sport
in which you _haVe to condition yourself on an’ individual
level and psych yourself up as an‘ individual. Besides’ swim-
mersare kind of kooky. They become so just by going back
and forth all the time”, p _ , , i

As Snyder kept talking the future of swimming grew
brighter.” Any swimmer should droll at what he sees at
Trees.” With contacts in the high schools, Snyder sees no
reason why Pitt can’t get the horses and reach the level of
schools like Yale and Maryland.

"In several years, Snyders’ secret dreams might become
a reality. -

We have to be patient. We have the ﬁnest.

ed the swimming reigns this year after Ben

 

formance.

KEN BOLLENS is having an erratic season. He
scored’ 14 points against Westminster in their previ-
ous game; 28 and 25 versus -VPI and Fordham, and
only three the last time out at WVU.

Westminster puts its five game winning " 
streak in “jeopardy” tomorrow afternoon '
gainst the cagers. Gametime at the Field:
House is 2:00 p.m.

The 12-2 Titans toppled the Panther five in their‘

and Pete Smith’s defensive play will probably de-
termine if the string will be broken. — O

Smith has the responsibility of guarding West-
minster’s John Fontanella, the Titans leading scor- 7
er, averaging better than 30 points a, game. Fon-_
tanella has demonstrated that his outside shooting‘
can win for Westminster. In New Wilmington, Smith;

Both teams have defeated Bucknell and Car-

Gvmnasts Oppose

Navy Tomorrow

Following five straight defeats, the gymnasts are well on their way

to their worst season in ten years. The gymnastic squad entertains V_

Navy tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. in Trees Gymnasium and based on pre-
vious performances, the gymnasts appear to have very little chance
of coming out on top. ' M » ‘

Although they have greatly improved from the beginning of the
season, the gymnasts are averaging at best ten points less than the
midshippmen.. Navy has lost only two meets this year—to the two
most powerful teams in the East, Springfield and Penn State. They
have been averaging in the low 170's compared to the gymnasts high
score of 161 against Army last week.

, Navy’s coach, John Rammacher, will bring in at least ‘15 partici-

, pants against the gymnasts seven.

Some of Navy’s outstanding participants are: George Gallagher
and Tom Wanner on the floor exercise, Jay Long, originally of Penn‘
Hills, on the side horse, Greg Owens on the trampoline, Craig Steidle
on the horizontal bar, and Neil Oshiro on the still rings.

Coach Neiger said “As long as Jim Sacco and Ig Perez can come
through the team as a whole generally does much better.” Last week
both boys placed in at least one of their events.

Being in the Eastern Collegiate Gymnastics League provides stiff
competition for the gymnasts. With the exception of;West Virginia on
February 21,'coach-Neiger admits that the gymnasts ‘have very little
chance of upsetting their other remaining meets against Penn State
on February 25 and Temple on February 24.

are 6-3 since that game, and are
9-3 for the year.
Frosh coach Tim Grgurich ex-

pects a tough game this time also. -

“They've got some good ballplay-i
ers. They have a few boys from
section three of the WPIAL, and

they’re always tough.” The sec-
tion three boys are Chuck Radu _

and Bill Samuels from Farrel, and
they lead the Little Titans along

iwith Jake Williams, a product of

the state champion Schenley High

If. Hassinger is not available,
his place will be taken by Bob

. Brickner, who came off the bench

to score 10 points against the
Little Mountaineers. In an ear-

lier game against Point Park, it

was two clutch foul shots by
Brickner which clinched the Cubs’
overtime victory.

Whoever is operating in the
backcourt, Grgurich expects West-
minster to employ_ the press,
which has become a, common
weapon of the Cubs opponents
lately. “We expect to see it the

Another surprising problem of
late has been the Cubs’ poor shoot-
ing. After hitting almost half of
their shots in the early going,
the frosh have hit just better
than 30 per cent of late.

“They’re.forcing a little,” Grgu-
rich states. “We’re coming up
court and shooting too fast. Of
course, that’s the natural tenden-
cy when you’re behind, and
we’ve been behind a lot of late.”

Along with these setbacks,
Grgurich sees some ‘positive de-
velopments. “At times we’ve play-

- ed. real well together. Bob Mc-

beautiful baseline drives. Charlie

‘Track

Team Journeys  

To Annapolis Saturday

When you try to fight the U.S. government, your
chances aren’t too good. Last Saturday, the U.S. forces from
West Point crushed the track team 84-16. This Saturday,

there is little to make anyone
believe that they won’t sulfer a
similar shellacking by the Navy
at Annapolis.

For one thing, no one beats the
Middies at Annapolis. They al-
ways have a ﬁne team anywhere,

and given the home track ad-

vantage it is almost impossible
for a sparse team like the tracks-
ters to even come close.

The meet with the Middies is
at Annapolis every year, so no
Fitzgerald- Field House records
are in jeopardy this week. But

 

Paul Greig, who broke a 38 year
old two-mile record last week,
will be trying for still a lower
time on Navy’s faster track. Tom
Christie was a tenth of a sec-
ond off a varsity hurdlesrecc-rd
two weeks ago.

The only change coach Jim
Banner plans to make will put
Larry Hubner in the 1,000-yard
run. Hubner has only run in~the
two—mile relay up to now. Frank
Handelman will run with him in
that event.

STAMP OUT YOUNG LOVE

It_happ_ens every day. Ayoung man goes off to college,
leaving his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal
love, and then he ﬁnds that he has outgrown her. What, in
such cases, is the honorable thing to do? '

Well sir, you can do what‘ Crunch Sigafoos did.

 

When Crunch left his home in Cut and Shoot, Pa., to go
off to a prominent midwestern university (Florida State)
he said to his sweetheart, a wholesome country lass named
Mildred Bovine, “My dear, though I am far away in col-
lege, I will love you always. I take a mighty oath I will
never look at another girl. If I do,imay my eyeballs parch
and wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may my
ever-press slacks go baggy I”

Then he clutched Mildred to his. bosom, ﬂicked some
hayseed from her hair, planted a ﬁnal kiss upon her fra-
grant young skull, and went away, meaning with all his
heart to be faithful.

But on the very_ﬁrst day of college he met a coed named
Irmgard Champerty who was studded with culture like a
ham with cloves. She knew verbatim the complete works
of Franz Kafka, she sang solos in stereo, she wore a black
leather jacket with an original Goya on the back.

Well sir, Crunch took one look and his jaw dropped and
his nostrils pulsed like a bellows and his kneecaps turned
to sorghum. Never had he beheld such sophistication, such
intellect, such saooir faire. Not, mind you, that Crunch
was a dolt. He was, to be sure, a country boy, but he had a.
head on his shoulders, believe you me! Take, for instance,
his choice of razor blades. Crunch always shaved with
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and if that doesn’t
show good’ sense, I am Rex the Wonder Horse. No other
blade shaves you so comfortably so often. No other blade
brings " you such facial felicity, such epidermal clan.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades take the travail out
of shaving, scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull,
oust the ouch. Furthermore, Personnas are available both
in double-edge style and in injector style. If you’re smart
—and I’m sure you are, or how’d you get out of high school
—you’ll get a pack of Personnas before another sun has set.

But I digress. Crunch, as we have seen, was instantly
smitten with Irmgard Champerty. All day he followed her ,
around campus and listened to her talk about Franz Kafka
and like that, and then be went back to his dormitory and
found this letter from his home town sweetheart Mildred:

Dear Crunch: .

Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to
the pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of
anybody. Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots
of nutsy stuﬁ’ like that. Well, I -must close now because I
got to whitewash the fence.

_ . Your friend,
Mildred

RS. . . . I know how to ride backwards on my skateboard.

Well sir, Crunch thought about Mildred and then he
thought about Irmgard and then a great sadness fell upon

"him. Suddenly he knew he had outgrown young, innocent

Mildred; his heart now belonged to smart, sophisticated
Irmgard. . ' ' -

Being above all things honorable, he returned forth-
with to Cut and Shoot, Pa., and looked Mildred straight in
the eye and said manlily, “I do not love you any more. I
love another. You can hit me in the stomach all your might
if you want toi’

“That’s okay, heyi’ said Mildred amiably. “I don’t love
you neither. I found a new boyi’ ,

“What is his name?” asked Crunch.

“Franz Kafka? said Mildred.

“I hope you will be very happyj’ said Crunch and shook
Mildred’s handand they have remained good friends to
this day. In fact, Crunch and Irmgard often double-date
with Franz and Mildred and have barrels of fun. Franz
knows how to ride backwards on his skateboard one-legged.

Aged Bench Warmer, Pete Smith

 

 

Scores as Basketball Holler Guy

by GEORGE LIES
Assistant Sports Editor

Too long a bench warmer, Pete
Smith deserved a chance to play.
If only for one reason, he’s a
scrapper.

From the basketball lair of
Uniontown’s Abe Everhart, Smith
was recruited by former Panther
coach John Nlichelosen in 1963 to
play football. Now he’s playing
basketball “under coach Bob Tim-
mons and why he is typliﬁes his
athletic career.

As a quarterback in his senior
year at Uniontown, he was quite
a scrambler and he-was named
to the Pennsylvania Big 33 East-
ern team.’Over 100 college re-
cruiters were after him, includ-
ing Dave Hart who was on Ken-
tucky’s payroll at that time.

4 He liked the local color and pu-
blicity, however, and so he ac-
cepted Michelosen’s offer, at the
time. This is his fourth year in
school, and it should have been
the year he was a member of
the worst Panther football team
record-wise in history. But there’s
a catch.

“I quit the team,” Smith said.
“And after the Fall term that
year I dropped out of school and
went home.” '

It was Smith’s sophomore year

Smith’s needed excelsior. Now
he’s the regular holler guy out
