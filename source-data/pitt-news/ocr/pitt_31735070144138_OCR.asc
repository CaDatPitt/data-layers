Relief is one year away for students

..Pitt’s branch campuses launched

to the Oakland campus next October.

Pitt veterans‘ group combats culture shock

by Kelly Thomas

Though today is Veterans Day,
Pitt veterans hope to meet more
than just once -a year. 7 -

The Student Veterans’ .Orga- i
nization _ allows young_ veterans

to help one another cope‘ with
the culture shock they experience
when they transition from life in
the armed forces to life on a col-

, lege campus, said member Mike

Boyd.

“I have_n’t been to Iraq,” said
Boyd, a member of the Air Na-

. tional Guard majoring in ﬁnance

and history at Pitt. “But I have ex-

. perienced the culture shock that
comes  going from a 

environment to an academic en-
vironment. I know it’s got to be a
lot harder if you’ve been in longer
or if you’ve been to Iraq.”

The group, got off to a slow
start, said its founder, business
admin_ist:ration professor and
Vietnam veteran Jay Sukits.

worked with Kris—. , _

The group began lastiDecem-
ber, Sukits said, but many ‘of its
members graduated last spring.

So Sukits -is currently 
to attract new members. Sukits
said it’s been hard to advertise the
group to students because _he’s
had to work through individual
departments within each school

_on campus, as opposed to send-

ing out mass messages.
So for now, he said, the group

will focus on setting goals.
“The short-term goal is to

get this viable,” said ‘Sukits. “The

intermediate goal is to get some _

events  to make sure veterans
are receiving all their VA beneﬁts.
The long-term goal would be to
get some . money to establish a
veterans’ scholarship.”

He added that, “Most of the
events we would have would be
targeted toward veterans’ benefits
and employment.”

Sukits said the group hopes to
help organize job fairs for student
veterans.

Natale agreed

“There’s a lot of students in the

don’t feel connected to the Univer-

involved [with CGS student govern-
ment] was to make sure that the CGS
student has a voice and is recognized
as being a part of the University.”

To solve this, CGS student gov-
ernmentmembers are reaching out

to other Pitt organizations. Natale
said she’s working with the executive
director of the Pitt Program Coun-
 Abbott, to organize events for
both CGS students and traditional
Pitt undergraduates.

Abbott said that the two groups
work together “to see if we can in-

High school students descended
on the William Pitt Union yesterday.
Dressed in “Western business at-
tire” — no denim, spaghetti straps
or athletic shoes — about 415 stu-

dents from 29 high schools through-

out Westem Pennsylvania prepared
to debate one another in the 12th
Annual Model United Nations con-
ference, which was sponsored by
the Pitt Model UN Club and several
other area organizations.

The goal, said Pitt Model UN
Club vice president Carl Shimel, was
to make high school students more
aware of the world surrounding
them.

“In my opening statements, I
made sure the kids knew that we
are not changing the world by do-
ing this, but increasing knowledge
of international issues that so many
Americans are ignorant of,” said
Shimel.

The high school students, who
were told that they may not be able
to participate in the event if they

. weren’t  “Western business

attire,” began their day by registering
in theunion at 8:30 am. yesterday.
Each group of six to 10 students
formed a delegation representing a
country.

The delegation members split up _

and attended committee meetings,
where they discussed various foreign
policy issues, including the Security
Council, disarmament and interna-
tional security, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Pan
American Health Organization.
‘This  Model UN confer-
ence is all about raising and increas-
ing awareness of these international
issues,” said Shimel. “We discuss
everything from indigenous health
care to debating the Vietnam War at
this conference.” P i V
At the end of the session, around

5 p.m., students met in the Assembly '

Room in the William Pitt Union for
closing statements. Several of -them
received diplomacy "awards for their
performance during the meetings. _ e

The Global Solutions Education
Fund, the University Center for In-
ternational Studies and the United

Nations Association of Pittsburgh,

At the other end of the truck,
microscopes allow students to
look at ﬂower and vegetables up

“close on television screens.

David Hornack from the

A Outreach Program said this area

was more appropriate to middle
school— and elementary—aged chil-
dren. _
“They look at scars, at cuts
and even broccoli,” said Hornack.
“We give them objects and ask

them to make predictions about
what they’ll see. Everything looks
entirely different.” V

The modiﬁed tractor—trailer
has 26 workstations at which stu-
dents may participate in scientiﬁc
experiments and other science ac-
tivities.

For the experiments, Legg
promised a fair mixture of old
and new science.

“The experiments will blend
current science with required aca-

demic standards,” she said.
Currently, the Outreach Pro-
gram reaches 4,000 students 
and around Allegheny County.
The project began when a
teacher from Dorseyville El-
ementary in Fox Chapel wanted
two speakers to visit the school

for its “DNA Day,” said Stephen-

Reis, Pitt’s ‘associate vice chancel-
lor for clinical research, Believing
he could do better than that, Reis
brought together the Outreach

Program and other groups and.

borrowed a mobile laboratory in-
side a 40-foot bus from Boston
University.

After three years of different
groups pushing for a mobile labo-
ratory for Pitt, the University’s
Clinical and Translational Science
Institute purchased the laboratory
for $120,000. Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc then donated supplies and
lab equipment.

In the future, the lab should

cost‘ about $25,000 per year to
keep in working condition.

The mobile lab is one of about
40 currently existing labs of this
kind in the nation.

Hornack explained how young-
er students beneﬁt from this.type
of laboratory environment.

“In high school, they learntthe
topic, and then they’re done,” he
said. “There’s more to it than that,
and they can learn it here.”

the branch campuses, 163 students ——
about half the campus’ population ——
registered online on Oct 16.

Tess Hopson, a freshman at Pitt-
Titusville, registered from her laptop
on the second day of the campus’ on-
line registration ,

“It was a lot more convenient than

havingtogothroughthisprocessthan_

having to set it up through paper,” she
said _“It was really easy toaccess, pretty
straightforward” ‘

-The only trouble she had with the
program was the technical aspect of
adding and dropping classes, she said

Limits in the system that prevent
students from  for too many
classes or for two classes at the same
time force students to go the
drop process before completing some
course requests. .

In order to handle any problems
that arose, Pitt’s head registrar Sam
Conte, three of his staE members and
Bob Treloar, a staff member in Com-
puter Services and Systems Develop-
ment, visited the registrar offices at the
branch campuses on their launch days

Despite fears, the computer system
was not overloaded on the first day of

registration '

“Really, the system response was
good,” said Conte. “Most of the stu-
dents took about three minutes to reg-
ister, and there wasn’t even a spike of
users on the system.” i

Currently, students at main cam-

. pus, which has about 27,000 graduate

and undergraduate students combined
— more than nine times the number
of students at]ohnstown’s campus -—
must see an adviser before 
either  their department or at
Thackeray  registration ofﬁce.
This won’t change with se1f.—regis—

tration online. Students will  access
to the registration system online only
after meeting with their advisers

Once theyve gained an advisers

« clearance, students will have set times

they can log into the system and com-
plete their registration.

Once registration is over, students
will not have to see advisers not visit
the registration office to add/ drop

' their courses

They can access the system 24
hours a day and add/ drop classes until
the add/ drop  ofﬁcially ends —
usually two weeks into the semester.

The PeopleSoft computerized
registration system that Pitt uses on
the mypittedu portal could support
self—registration since 2006, but Pitt has
waited to enable the option

Conte said the branch campuses
will hold their registrations for the
summer 2009 and fall 2009 semesters

.on the samedays, Feb 16 and March
a 19, respectively.-

Pitt’s main campus will move to

the spring 2010 semester, “so we’re on

Obama AIDS policy   .

reflects global perspective I

For the past eight years, the
-Bush administration has ap-
proached the global AIDS crisis
with a narrow agenda.

. While President George W
j Bush’s $45 billion PEPFAR pro-
: gram brought AIDS drugs to
W nearly 3 million people in poor
W countries like Rwanda and Ugan-
V da, his public health policies have
' largely promoted abstinence edu-
E cation and monogarny over safe
; condom use.

‘ During Bush’s presidency,
: the government took signiﬁcant
measures to restrict education on
condom use. In fact, Gill Greer,
director general of the Interna-
tional Planned Pregnancy Feder-
ation in London, told Bloomberg
News that the US. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
even removed some information
about condoms from its- Web
site. i

“The U.S. administration
has certainly succeeded in - de-
monizing condoms rather than
showing that they can be part of
prevention of both unplanned
- pregnancy and sexually transrnit-
ted infections,” said Greer.

The current administration
has provided more money to
fight AIDS than any other ad-
ministration in U.S. history. But
Bush’s abstinence education
policies are naive and ignore the
fact that there are blatant cultural
and, societal differences between
various peoples throughout the
world.

These narrow policies have
hindered sexually transmitted
disease prevention and general
family planning, Susan F. Wood,
co-chairman" of President-elect

Barack Obama’s advisory com-
mittee for women’s health, told
Bloomberg News.

Wood also said that the Bush
administration has, in the past
few years, swayed and “tightly
vetted” various international
groups to mirror .U.S. policies.

This arrogant approach once

again fails to take into consid— 

eration the lifestyle differences
between people across the world
and seeks to impose U.S. stan-
dards on people who are not
American. ' _ .

Under an Obama adrninistra-
tion, there will be major changes.

Obama will replace the current
administration’s approach with a
more realistic policy, emphasizing
condom use and family planning

to prevent unintended pregnan-

cies and the spread of dangerous
diseases. The president—elect will
approach the AIDS crisis with
the balanced and worldly per-
spective it requires. '

Obama’s perspective is. a re-
freshing change to the limited
ideology of the past eight years.
However, such a drastic shift
from abstinence instruction to
the promotion of .condom use
must be supplemented with the
necessary education.

Otherwise, the shift could be
deadly. Those who live in coun-
tries where AIDS is a big prob-
lem should be informed of pre-
vention methods, how they work
and how they can fail.

Full sex education - not just
abstinence—only — is key to en-

suring -that people lead safe lives ,

and that they do ‘not harm oth-

ers. Without it, no policy is com- T

plete.

famous person of power in the
past.

The old reincarnation gag
is the oldest trick in the power-
hungry book. Many people don’t
know this, but a lot of prominent
leaders and visionaries have, at
one time, claimed to be a rein-
carnation of another even more
powerful person._ For example,
Genghis Kahn once alleged
that he was the reincarnation of
Ramesses- II, knowing full well
that Mongols were huge fans of
Egyptian lore. This pretty much
makes Genghis equivalent to the
powerball jackpot to those look-
ing for a past life, since prospec-
tive past-life shoppers can then
claim Ramesses II as a past life,
too. Two past lives for the

price of one_ is a pretty good
deal.

But of course, reincarnation
fads must also be taken into ac-
count.-For example, right now
it is quite in vogue to claim an
American revolutionary as a
reincarnation.- These days, it

It all started several weeks

except colder. Too cold, I had

That afternoon, I was loiter-

sometimes do, crunching leaves
and kicking stones —— the usual
hood-rat stuff. little did I know
that my life was about to change
forever, for—ev-er.

All at once, the sky darkened.
It was as if a great cloud had cov-
ered the sun (I will neither con-
firm nor deny that this is actually

-what happened). Then came two
great orbs ‘of light, redder than a-

pack of Big Red gum:
“What is this?” I hissed.

voice boomed.

Dear Editor,

Jeff Abraham
School of Arts and ‘Sciences

My letter is in response to the growing consensus around
rack Obama’s election, we live in a great country and should be proud. We have always lived in a great country
and should have always been proud. '

We should be proud that a black person is now able to rise and achieve the opportunity to be president like
Obama has. It is the-opportunity,  onlythat, which is the key However, it is erroneous to imply that our
country would not_«be asgreat, or we should not have been as proud, if the election ended differently.

The United States and its founding. principles of inherent God-given rights laid the foundation for its own
abolition of slavery, equal rights movement and this election of Obama. I know, many of those men were big-
bts and owned slaves, but they were men of their times. Their ideals and words gave an aspiration, a dream, a
, goal. They gave a vision to us so that we could one day create a place in which we treat all people with respect,

‘ as though, in their words, we were  created equally. Our realities would not have been possible without those
men’s dreams, ideals and words. Millions, black and white,‘ have died and suffered in the defense of these dreams,
to protect these ideals, to make real the promise of thoseiwords. The election of Obama should not be what
makes us proud. The opportunity given to him should. Obama did not make this country great. He is proof that
it is great. And he is not the cause of that famous change he stands for. He is a product of it.

“Study the life of Brown,” it
growled. “Molly Brown.”

\Well, the panther didn’t know
this yet, but no one tells me what
to do.

“No!” I shouted, while run-
ning off toward the Cathedral.

' But like Semkiw, I couldn’t es-
cape my destiny.

As I attempted to jaywalk
across Bigelow Boulevard, an-
other apparition appeared: Molly
Brown, herself. -

It was just like one of those
holograms on CNN, except real.
And I have to say, she really does
look just like Kathy Bates! I

“Molly,” she said to me, her

white—laced holographic gloves
clenched authoritatively. “You
have to stop running from your
past!”

“But I" don’t understand,” .I
said. “I was running from that gi-
ant panther ‘statue, not my past.”

“That panther is your past!”
she bellowed. “As am I. You are
my reincarnation, which techni-
cally means that this conversa-
tion can’t be happening, but no
matter.” I

Like Iam of most things in
my life, I was suspicious of what
this Molly Brown character was
telling me.

“How can.I trust you? I don’t
want to tell people about this

and have them think that this is
just some ploy for attention or
an extremely long-winded joke
or something. I need hard" evi-
dence.”'

‘Wake up, Molly,” she told
me. “Haven’t you’ ever noticed
the remarkable way our hair
glints ‘the same color brown in
the afternoon sunshine? Or how
peculiar it  that we both have
10 toes and 10 ﬁngers and two
arms and two legs? Surely that
can’t be a coincidence.” U

As much as I didn’t want to
admit it, this hologram was mak-
ingsense.

I ‘:‘Or,” she began slowly with a
I twinkle in her eye, “that we both

have an undying, dare I say, un-

T sinkable love for hats?”

My eyes widened in shock.
It’s true. I do really lo_ve hats.

I bowed myhead in submis.-
sion. “Tell me what you need me
to do.”

T‘End your life , of petty
crime,” she told me, “and spread
my legacy. Also, become very

rich while doing so and accumu— '

late much fame and power. For
every million dollars you make, I

Then she tipped her hat to

ever.‘

Pittsburgh:
A Tradition of Innovation

Sen. John Heinz History Center
Strip District

Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

In the past 250 years, Pittsburgh
has been home to innovations in
technology, art, medicine, industry,
education, sports and entertain-
ment.

And to celebrate the city’s an-
niversary, the Senator John Heinz
History Center is squeezing all that
history into one exhibition — one

exhibition that takes up 16,000
square feet.

Pittsburgh: A Tradition of In-
novation features the hundreds of
people and inventions originating
in Pittsburgh that have helped to
improve oui world.

The ‘long—term exhibition
chronicles Pittsburglfs ground-
breaking journey from its earliest
days up through the 21 stcentury,
including more than 50 hands—on
interactive displays, life~size recre-
ations of inﬂuential Pittsburghers
and artifacts on loan from the
Smithsonian Institution.

The exhibition tells the story of
the city from its early beginnings

through the Lewis and Clark expe-
dition, to its role in_theCivil War

and the impact that it has had ‘on '

major industries. -

“\We’Ve actually been 
on this for ﬁve or more years_,”" said
Andy Masich, president andCEO .

of the History Center.  that
the Pittsburgh 250was<the perfect
time to launch it, he emphasized
that there is “a lot more to the in-
novation story than just technol-
ogy.”

Masich believes that Pittsburgh’s
geographiclocation isolated by the
Allegheny Mountains and nestled‘
between the three riversifostered
natives’ “can—do” spirit.

“Pittsburghers had to rely on
ingenuity. That engendered a kind
of spirit that we still see today,” he

A 10,000-year-old musician
who's just getting started

by Colleen Counihan
Staﬂ W/rite/‘
Bob Schneider
Tonight
Diesel, South Side

Older than 21 show
Doors open at 7 p.m.
$18-$20

Bob Schneider is a 10,000—year<)ld, normal-
sized man with insides as big as the “Poseidon
Adventure”

These may seem to be odd approximations,
but according to Schneider, the descriptions
couldn’t be more accurate.

He said that his inner “Poseidon Adventure”
(the old movie, not the new one) is crucial to his
live performances because each time he plays, he
loses a part of himself. Therefore there has to
be a lot there in order for him to still be around.
Also, the 10,000—plus years he has lived have
somehow been calculated using a Theremin.

Schneider is a singer—songw1:iter with a back-
ground in visual arts and a personality that is as
chameleonic as the music he plays. He compares
his sound to a blindfolded person throwing
thousands of darts at a dartboard made up of
Woody Guthrie, l\/Iichael Buble, Lil’ Wayne and
many other artists

He admits that his music can be hard to pin
down with one particular style or genre, but this
suits his sometimes scrambled identity. .

“I’m a mix between Lucinda Williams, Lil’
Wayne and Englebert Humperdink,” he said in
a phone interview with The Pitt News ‘Tm an
iPod Shufﬂe kind of guy.”

This sentiment is evident throughout Sch—
neidefs eclectic albums, but it’s in his live shows
that he purposely mixes  up — whether it
be his demeanor or his music This sort of style
discrepancy creates the confusion and intrigue
that Schneider wants his audiences to feel.

‘Tm not a big fan of shows where it’s all one

note,” he - lained. “The idea is that varie

 

 

it”

 

keeps shows  I want [the audience] to
be like, ‘What the P“**?’ Most of the people who
see me play are loyal, devoted fans, so they are
expecting the unexpecte .”'

Schneider is undoubtedly proud of his ability
to transcend genre boundaries, but he also ac-
knowledges that dismissing a common thread in
one’s music can lead to less success and repre—_
sentation in the long run And less success cer-
tainly can be bothersome — Schneider says he
often feels like the children’s story “The Princess
and the Pea” — he’s laying on 10 mattresses, and
the pea jabbing into his back is the “one—tra ”
bands that’ll be the ones that  more fame

“I’m like the 3-year-old with Legos, and what
I build doesn’t last long, and it doesn’t really look
like a rocket shipf’, he explained morosely. “Then
there’s Radiohead, and they build these rocket
ships out of thousands of Legos, and their rock-
et ships really look like one”

Schneider said that his inﬂuences range ﬁtom
Gary Newman to Sigur Ros. His main inﬂuence
is his father, who taught: him to play guitar when
he was 3 and ﬁlled his household with music and
entertainment

Though he can be disheartened by the music
industry’s bias toward “genre—molded” bands, he
wouldn’t_want to work in any other ﬁeld.

‘Tm my own boss, I can play whatever and
whenever I want, and'I don’t have to set an alarm
clock and go to a job in the mo ' ” he said

 up to the February release of his
ninth full—length album, tentatively titled Inim-
cludng Bob Scbnadeig he is out touring the United

" States He’ll be stopping by Pittsburgh tonight to

offer a show full of mood  and surprise
It should be expected from a man that enjoys
breaking norms and  lifeinto one giant
metaphor, though. -
“I have a- Da Da mindset,” said Schneider,
citing the post-Wodd War I art movement.
“I create it and destroy it, create it and destroy

Behind Bob Schneider's thick, full beard is a mind capable of musical mayhem.

by Tom VanBuren

Dream\X/orks Animation recently premi

the first trailer for “Monsters vs. Aliens,” an ani- ‘
. mated -3-D movie about  well, guess 3-D _has
_ been  a slow comeback for years — two

years ago, Disney started the trend with its suc-
cessﬁil digital 3-D treatment of “The Nightmare
Before Clrtristmas.” Since then, the studio has re-
released the movie in theaters each year.

Other ﬁlmmakers picked up on the trend,
leading to 3-D releases of movies like “Beowulf,”
“Superman Returns” and‘ “Harry Potter and
the Order of the Phoenix.” Unlike those mov-
ies, which gave the treatment to only a select few.
IMAX prints, ‘Monsters vs Aliens” was created
and directed  with 3-D in mind, allow-
ing for new innovations that take advantage of the

‘ effect; '

The re—emergence of 3-D, though, is the
product of Hollywood’s great fear of the last de-
cade —— people might stop going to the movies
And it isn’t an unfounded worry. \W1th the near
perfection of HDTV and Blu-Ray and the ease
of programs like Netﬂix, home theaters can ﬁnal-

ly rival real theaters The movie theater, then, has a
to promise not only a venue, but an experience -—— '

sornething that you wont get at home, no matter
how nice your plasma screen. -

Midnight screenings are increasingly popular,
as are special IMAX releases — “Hannah Mon-
tana and Miley Cyrus: Best of -Both \Worlds Con-
cert” and “The Dark Knight’ ’ both broke records
this year for ]1\/IAX ticket sales The theater itself
has transformed in the past decade, with movie
palaces like AMC Loews offering restaurants, full
bars and leather seating

Though these perks are welcome, experiment-
ingwith theater-exclusives  3-D treatments isn’t

most unbearably  \X71th some post—produc—
tion razzle—dazzle, a movie can go from ho—hum
to engrossing —— the problem is, once the veneer
of the special presentation is stripped away, you’re
left with the same bland movie you had before
Another example is this years “Journey to
the Center of the Earth,” a movie that received
so-so reviews, though its 3-D effects were widely
praised Now with “Monsters vs Aliens,” this
trend could easily go either way — it could legiti-
mize 3-D as a cinematic tool or further prove that
it’s only a gimmick used to sell tickets to otherwise
unremarkable movies '

As a trend, 3-D isn’t alone — many medio- '

cre movies are sold on the promise of .impressive
visuals, be it animation, explosions, ﬂashy 
andso on. But3—Disuniqueinitsgoaltob1ing
audiences into the theater The days of visual ef-
fects alone attracting audiences are long gone —
they look better on an HDTV anyway.

No, if studios and theaters want to sell tick-
ets, they try to promise something that you won’t
ﬁnd anywhere else 4 in this case, a 3-D spectacle
If you wait for it on DVD, all you’ll get to see is
 old—fashioned and twadimensional. The

problem is, even if you see it in the theater, you’ll

never be able to recreate that expeiience.
If studios really want to keep audiences com-
ing to the theater, the best solution is the simplest
* one: Make better movies That’s surely easier said
than done, but if a movie is good enough, the au-
dience simply won’t be  to wait to see it (or
see it twice). ,
“The Dark Knight” made more than $500
million this year, and though it was slightly bol-
stered by  sequences in IMAX format,
it only added styie to its already-abundant sub-
stance.

Tnstead of costiy experiments —— the 3-D ef- i

fects for “Monsters vs Aliens” cost $15 million to

produce .— studios would be well off to concen-

      
 

necessatily a good  year, “Beowulf” in trate their efforts on rent pole releases with staying
IMAX 3-D was a thiillingand memorable theater power. And  all, wouldn’t that be  for
experience. Watching it on DVD, though, is al- audiences, too? ‘

Sparko. The 7—foot—tall Elektro, built for the
1939 World’s Fair, could identify colors, count
and was even equipped with billows in order
to give him the ability to smoke cigarettes.

Additionally, because the History Center
is a Smithsonian-afﬁliated museum, it had its
pick of 144 million objects and specimens to
borrow for the display. Artifacts like George
W"/ashington’s peace pipe used in Western
Pennsylvania during the French and Indian
War and the ﬁrst transmitter from KDKA
Radio are showcased, bringing a sense of au-
thenticity to the exhibit.

The exhibition also takes a peak at inno-
vations in arts, entertainment and food, like
the invention of McDonald’s Big Mac and

,the more recent inception of Heinz Com-

pany’s wide—mouth ketchup bottle.
“It’s a broader experience of the story
of innovation than people would expect,”

said the exhibition’s lead curator, Anne Made

arasz.

“I think it’s a great exhibit for people who
are new to the region,” added Ned Schano,
director of communications for the muse
urn. “People who were born and raised here
will feel a sense of pride as they walk out of
the exhibit.” ' '

“One innovation that will surprise peo-
ple,” said Masich, “is the first professional
football game.” ‘

The game, held  1892 here in Pittsburgh
with the Allegheny Athletic Association fac-
ing offagainst the Pittsburgh Athletic Club,
is considered by sports historians to be the

first professional football game because one ,

player was paid $500 for this grudge match.

um’s displays particularly interesting because
of the connections to the University of
Pittsburgh — from University of Pittsburgh

' Medical Center advances such as Jonas Salk

and the polio vaccine to the first successful
liver transplant by Thomas Starzl.

Pitt’s sports history is also well docu-
mented. KDKA’s ﬁrst radio play—by-play
broadcast of a football game was a Pitt vic-
tory over West Virginia University. And the

 

Cathedral of Learning is recognized as the
first educational skyscraper. . .
Looking to the future, the exhibit features
Pittsburgh robotics, medicine and higher edu-
cation that will continue to impact the region
and the world. Also, Pittsburgh is a leader in

Game

More than 40 Pitt basketball alumni
returned for the weekend They at-
tended the Pitt—Louisville football game
on Saturday, a brunch Sunday morning
and a  later that day before
the Pitt—La Roche preseason game,
where the alumni were introduced and
honored at halftime

While it might not have had the
athleticism or fast pace of the Pitt—La
Roche  the alumni game

1 ;. was much more closely contested, end-

 

ing with the gold team defeating the
blue team, 47-43.

\X/ith the game tied at 43, Smith hit

Smith, along with Pitt, organized
the game in honor of Bill Baied, a 1951
honors graduate at Pitt and member of
the basketballteam. He died onAptil

“I deﬁnitely can’t take credit for put-

"The Universityhas beengreatin sup-

After  Baied founded
Baied Automotive and throughout
the years generously donated to Pitt
and other establishments in Pittsburgh.
He provided the lead  for the Baied

andrecreation area in the Pete, and Bai-
eri Basketball Center, which includes
locker rooms, meeting rooms and prac-
tice facilities for Pitt’s basketball teams

Lane also said it’s the first time he’s

Mat:tJones is a man’s man.

Well, hold on a second. He’s a

not in any other way. He’s so manly he
can’t even stop other guys — football
players of course ——- from

Enter Joey Porter, ﬁguratively of-
course.

Porter, the former Steelers line-
backer and current Miami Dolphin,

was on a conference call with media _

members He was asked about the
NFL  down on hard hits,
since commissioner Roger Goodell
sent a letter to all teams telling them

that first time offenders would be
ﬁned He’s carried through on that let-
ter quite a bit this season.

“[Matt Jones] got caught with
cocaine,” said Porter to the Associ-
ated Press “How does he  away
with that? And then you fine people
$20,000 for  comments to the

Jones _was on Portefs mind at all. So
what’s the big deal with a littie cocaine

Pitt wrestlers start strong

at Nlichigan State Open

by Sergei Feldman
Staﬂ Writer

7 The Pitt wrestling team opened
its 2008-09 season with a success-

ful showing at the Michigan State I

University Open Sunday.

Pitt-wrestlers placed in seven of
10 weight classes, while seven ﬁn-
ished in at least the top six of their
individual classes. _

The standout was the strong
display by freshman Zac Thomus-
seit, a three-time state medalist in
Ohio who battled to a second-
place ﬁnish.

After a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish at the
Eastern Michigan Open, Thomus-
seit wrestled to three consecutive
victories. . After pinning Olivet’s
]o'e Bargerstock and succeeding a
9-8 decision against EMU’s Derek
Foore, Thomusseit lost his only
match in the ﬁnals against North-
western’s Jake Herbert, who was
ranked second in the" 184—pound

weight class and was the 2007 Na-
tional Champion.
But Thomusseit wasn’t the only.

freshman to make an impactat the ‘

Open. Freshmen Chris Albright
and Tyler Nauman got the season
started with impressive showings
of their own. _ '
Albright ﬁnished_ with a 4-2
record, which earned him a
ﬁfth-place ﬁnish on the day. The

highlight of Albright’s day was a"

third-round pin against Indiana’s
Wes Fike in a consolation bracket
match. ' A 

Nauman couldn’t have asked
for a better start, as he pinnedhis
ﬁrst two opponents. A quarterﬁnal
match against eventual .141—pound
weight—class winner Ryan Williams
ended the run. Nauman ﬁnished
5-2 onthe day.

Sophomore Ethan Headlee
tormented opponents through his
opening four matches, propelling
himself to a semiﬁnals showdown.

He eventually lost. to Indiana’s Paul
Young, but still ﬁnished with a 6-2
record after a ﬁfth—place match,
which he capped off with a pin.

Junior Jimmy Conroy succeed-
ed through his ﬁrst two matches by
way of a tech fall and a major de-
cision. A I33-pound bracket semi-
ﬁnals match resulted in a loss to
Michigan State’s Franklin Gomez,
who came in ranked third in the
USA Todaylntermat/NWCA
preseason rankings. He ﬁnished
the day with a fourth-place show-
ing. .
Head coach Rande Stottlemy-
er praised his team’s efforts and
abilities to build off of work from
prior weeks. Noting the superior
competition at the MSU Open,
Stottlemeyer said he was conﬁdent
the experience will prove beneﬁcial
in the long term.

streak, Panthers stumble it

by Randy Liebernian
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball
match against Cincinnati on Sunday
belonged to its seniors in ceremony,
but not in the result. A 4

The Panthers (15-12, 7-5) hon-
ored their five seniors during their
last regular-season home match,
but lost to-the Bearcats, 3-0.

Kelly Campbell, Jessica Moses,
Monica Macellan, Stephanie Ross
and Nicole Taurence all received
plaques, ﬂowers and rounds of ap-
plause  honor of their four years
of service to Pitt’s program.

“I guess it was bittersweet,” said
Pitt coach Toby Rens. “It was nice

' to celebrate the efforts of the ﬁve
seniors and what they’ve done for
this program. They’ve been -a joy to
coach for my short time this year.”

On the year, the ﬁve seniors
have accounted for 55 percent of ‘
the team’s points and have also wel-

comed the challenge of adapting to

playing-
‘ “I really appreciate the effort

seen,” said Rens. “It’s not easy for

anybody, but we’ve developed as a
team and a program.”

Rens constantly praised his "se-
niors’ excellent work ethic, lead-
ership and determination. But it
didn’t all show in Sunday’s loss.

Still, Pitt has two games remain-
ing — both on the road. It faces
Syracuse this Friday and Marquette
on Sunday before hosting the Big

East tournament at the Fitzgeraldﬂr '

Field House on Nov. 21.

The ‘Panthers currently rank
sixth in the Big East With two
games remaining, Rens said thejfre
excited to improve their seed and
play in front of their home crowd.

“It’s one more opportunity for
the seniors to play at home,” said
Rens. ‘The idea of playing on your
home court means you have to

ponent is. It still always boils down to how

bad you want it.” y
The Panthers lost by the scores of 25-12,

25-23 and 25-20 against the Bearcats on Sun-

day. .

‘Pitt managed just a .115 hitting clip and

committed 1-9 attack errors during the loss.
Sophomore Amy Town -led the Panthers

. with 11 kills and added four digs. Junior Mea-

gan Dooley added six kills,

as the Bearcats closed out the game on a 5-0

run

The Panthers came out of the break and_

opened the third set to the tune of a 9-4 lead.

. But the Bearcats went on a 9-1 run to gain a

13-10 advantage. The Panthers battled to tie
the match at 15 all, and then later at 18. ,
But from then, the Bearcats ﬁnished on a
7-2 run to close out the match.
It was similar" to what happened to Pitt
Friday night against Lou-

Taurence had 16 assists
and junior Michelle Rossi
amassed 10 digs.

The Panthers struggled
on both sides of the net in
the first game and failed to
get  going.

a little tentative at the start.
If we would’ve matched them from the start,
it probably would’ve been a different out-
come.” ’ .
Eventually, as the Panthers gained more
conﬁdence, their hitting clip improved to .138
in the second game, which was the closest
game in the contest. Neitherteam stretched
its lead past three points throughout the
match. _ V ‘

Later in the match, Moses and Ross com-
bined on a block to give Pitt a 17-16 lead. On
the next play, Moses and Campbell stuffed
another Bearcat attack to give Pitt a two-point
lead and force a Cincinnati timeout.

Later, the Panthers gained a 21-19 advan-
tage on a block from Dooley and Campbell
and forced another Bearcat timeout. Dooley
then capped a 2-1 run for the Panthers with
a kill, but it was their last'score of the match

led the Panthers with 15
kills, while also posting
seven digs. Dooley hit .400 and tied sopho-
more Amy Town for second on the team with
ﬁve  Freshman Allyson I-Iodnik’s 18 as-
sists were _a teamhigh. Pitt battled back and
looked strong in the third set, but eventually
lost control. ’

Despite the losses, Rens said he was im-
pressed with Pitt’s resiliency against a tough
opponent. _ ~

“You certainly don’t have any» breathing
room against a team at that level,” said Rens.

He added that Syracuse and Marquette
both play different styles, with Syracuse being
very similar to Pitt. '

‘Tm expecting some long rallies and close
games,” said Rens of Syracuse.» ‘They’re

also ﬁghting to get into the  East] tour-‘

nament. We’re playing to the higher seed.”
