_   Ballerina Markova

Discusses Dancing

In Midday Speech

By RERNI McLEOD ‘
At age nine, Alice Marks wanted to be a doctor, until
someone discovered her birth-defect. Upon the advice of a



doctor, 'she'began ballet lessons. In 1963, Alice, now Dame

Alicia Markova, “_hung up her ballet shoes” after a career
in dance which has brought‘ her acclaim on five continents
and recognition as “the greatest living dancer.” At Wednes-

day’s Midday session,’ Dame‘ Alicia, now ‘a. lecturer, chore-_

ographer and ‘director, gave her views.

Introduced by Mrs. Jeanne Beaman, associate professor
of physical education, Dame Alicia began her talk which
included a discussion of the professional dancer, changes in
ballet, and many of her ownexperiences.

According to Dame Alicia, ballet, which began inlthe
French courts, has changed over the years as has the ballet

dancer. “Often young dancers are confused,” she began,
“they don’t realize the difference between an art and_a job.”

Although one can quit at 5 p.m.,  art preoccupies the indi-
vidual. ‘I ﬁnd that in our present world, young people don’t
realize this. They need a track to get on; they must know
where .they are going,” she said. —

Dame Alicia “found_her track” j ‘

early in life. By age 14 ‘she was
dancing in a ballet troupe, some-‘
thing unheard of at the time.

year, practice was hard and hours
long “before the days of unionsﬂf
Often with an “inspired” ‘choreo-
grapher, the dances would prac-
tice, from 9 a.m. until 4. a.m. the
next morning. “It was very
hard,” she noted, “but look, I’m
still here.” ‘ '
Dame Alicia also noted the
' changes in the ballet audiences.
When she entered the ﬁeld, audi-
ences were composed of experts.
“I always thought at the time, as .
today,” she explained, “why can’t
more people enjoy ballet? I have
always disagreed with my fellow
artists who are against touring.
Most of her daily ballet work
involved touring, “before theage

of nylon.” “The ﬁrst yearl slept‘

on a train every night. It shook
solmuch that I had to train my-
self to sleep, otherwise I realized ‘
that I would never last two
weeks.”
in Many times they stopped in '
towns’ with nothing more than a
“Woolworth’s and a drug store."’
They would rush to the nearest
hotel for a bath, after being on_
a tnain for "two weeks. “The press
never understood these problems
of ours,” she noted. “We were not
supposed tobe human.” M
Today, off the ballet circuit,
and no longer performing her-
self, Dame Alicia is not idle. She
choreographs ‘and is both direc-
tor of. the New York Metropolitan
Opera Ballet Company and in
charge of Metropolitan Ballet
School. As Mrs. Beaman noted
she is now fulﬁlling the? second

Sociologis? Says

Stalinist Is Individual

By HOBART HARRIS .

The Stalinist mind appears to be a_ very tenacious» phe-
nomena when it exists in a totalitarianistic society, accord-
ing to Dr. Daniel Kubat, speaking at the seminar in Soviet
Studies,Wednesday evening. His paper was based’ onthe
theories of socialpsychology which recognizes the existence
of the totalitarian personality, and the possibility that such
personality types are concentrated in the lower classes.

Working from these assumptions. and the historical
evidence that the Lenin and Stalin governments were indeed
totalitarian, Kubat described; the “new Soviet man,” which
he characterized as, responsible, "rational, and individualistic-
However, Kubat asserted that these traits have’, to be con-
sidered in the context inlwhich they appear: Soviet Russia.

Therefore, tlie..Sta1inist ideal is rationality in non-doc-
trinal areas, but ‘rationalism in the realm of doctrine only to

the point that a feeling of doubt
appears. The Stalinist is’individ-
ualistic; he absorbs and emotion-
alizes .the party’s teachings. Fi-
nally, he is’ responsib1e—respon-
sibly accepting his own individ-
«ual. rationality on the partyline
and nothing else. ~
This philosophical single-mind-I

' edness sometimes leads to con-

- ﬂicts with reality among the" par-'

ty faithful, a situation which -it ‘C

“is not necessary that the thought.
move towards reality; but real-
ity must ,move towards the

, thought.” The resulting personal-

ity, Kubat viewed as being 3'15-
.tere, hard-working, conscientio,us,t
and adopted to working withina
rigid structure.

Kubat then went on to outline
the forces which he contended
would maintain‘ the position of
this‘ type of personality, in the
Soviet power structure ideﬁnite-
ly., First, he observed that young-
er party functionaries would con-
tinue to be totalitarian on the
/theory that emulation of the suc-
-cessful personality’ types in the
culture would “enhance the
chances of I upward

tem tends to perpetuate this type

virtues that the totalitarian has

radicalism on the part of the in-

,With these conservative 'ten-. \

dencies in mind, Kubat predicted
that Russia will “remain reason-

predicted the continuing domin-
tance of the Stalinist mind in Bus-
sia; , ' ’
During a short discussion per-
iod after Kubat’s presentation,
several people in the audience
questioned some of his assertions. '
One, a man yvho characterised
himself as oriented towards, lit-w

CHARLES CIIADWICK
“S” Award Winner

By CHARLES REINER

To borrow from the words of’
. Francis Bacon, “Travel, in the
, [younger sort, is a part of educa-
tion.” And last summer, seven
students from the University
were given the privilege of par-
taking in this special kind of
education. These students were
recipients of seven scholarships
offered by the University for the
purpose of travel, study, and
work in Europe. But they did
' much more than the above. They
 were enlightened to the different
§.ways of life in this world, and
. 1 their respective outlooks were
vastly broadened because of it.

Bev Reifman, a senior politi-
cal science major, who was the
recipient of the Fredric Schaefer
Memorial Scholarship for study
in Norway, was asked about the
life of the European student.
“When you ask a European stu-
dent what life means to them,
they don’t say it’s a new car or
-'a date with a beautiful girl. They
"say it_’s a concert, it’s being at
the Louvre for a few hours, or
it’s discussing politics or drama
"at a’ cafe for hours on end. Their
whole emphasis on life, their ori-
entation is so, different Educa-
tion ‘to them is an opening, a
;window, a privilege to the whole

  Reactions To Residin

ARLA JEAN ANDERSON
Worked in Spain

Susan Scott a junior French
major, who was the winner of
the French Nationality Room
Scholarship, explained in this
manner, “The people I stayed
with in France didn’t e.ven have
a refrigerator, but they had a
large library and they were al-
ways encouraging me to read so
I could understand more’ about
France or read for fun.”

Lois Brady, a junior art-history
major, who was the recipient of
the Nationality Classrooms Schol-
arship, gave another important
reason for this creative environ-
ment. “The Europeans don’t base
their lives on material things.
It's a whole different atmosphere
where the emphasis is placed on
more basic things, but at the
same time more sophisticated
things than a new car or a new
home.” The European education-

. al system is basically a competi-

tive one in that, “by the time
you're .12 you can be finished‘
with your formal schooling if
you don’t pass the exams.” But

there was a general agreement

among the students that the arts
were patronized by most of the
people, not only the upper eche-
lons who had received their uni-
versity degrees.

One question that is frequently

posed to European travelers upon.
their return to the United States
is how" the European feels about
America and the Americans.
Charles Chadwick, a senior math
major, «who was the winner of
the “S” Award Scholarship, gave

' his observations. “The Europeans

are deﬁnitely appreciative of
America. They admit that their
economy would not be what it is
without American aid. They real-
ly don’t want to despise us. They
say, !Please! Please! Please! Tell
us why you are acting this way.”

The only real view the "Euro-
pean gets of the American, is
through watching the actions of
the American tourist in his coun-
try. It is here the U.S. image
runs into trouble. There was the
American tourist standing in
front of the Mona Lisa and say-
ing, “She’s not so beautiful, my
wife is prettier ” Then one of the
students told of the American
Jeweler who was seatedfive seats
down from an American student
in the Paris Opera. -Right ‘in the
middle of a performance this
American jeweler yelled across
to the girl; in order to ﬁnd out
if she had number eight or num-
ber nine pearls on. A O

But is the tourist the sole cguse
for the low opinion of American
abroad? According to Bev Reif-
man it isn’t. “I think our For-
eign Service has deﬁnitely made
poor impressions around the
world. Why, they don’t even take
the time to learn about the peo-
ple and customs of the country
that they are working in.” Most
of the‘. students said that they

sometimes found themselves very

No Change Seen
In Stalinist Type

(Continued from Page 1)
However, Kubat did not think

that these things were perma-
nent phenomena, and predicted
that such liberal trends follow
a sort of cyclic path that would
soon lead to suppression, as has
already happened to some of
Yevtushenko’s work. A

Kubat also seemed/to feel that
there was little chance that the
upper classes’ interests,’ such as
their enjoyment of the luxuries,
their desire that their children
succeed to positions similar to
theirs; their desire to avoid criti-
cism over any mistakes they
make would lead to a change in
the model personality types and
views of this class away from
totalitarianism.

the opportunity of full" preparation for adult life and a chance to improve
student activities. A , — _ i
The lack ofparticipation and low calibre programming in student
activities is evident. Yet, neither Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs Helen
Rush nor other student affairs personnel will openly assert the point.
Miss Rush was confronted with the issue at Wednesday night’s panel
on the leadership role of women in the University. Her comments were

the same tired-out generalizations about nice ideal situations.

l

J"
:

Miss Rush seems either completely alienated from contemporary
trends in student affairs ()r too apprehensive to take a stand on the issue.
She appears to fear making a strong stand will bring accusations _of infring-
ing on student rights." , ' . - '

On this issue, it is her duty to speak up firmly and denounce the poor
‘interest in student activities. She should say, as did Mrs. Kline, that “stu-

dents are prone to accept things only done by a handful of students and

this is not a good preparation for careers.” She should not fear saying “I

think many students may be willing, but participation is not widespread.” ~
Middle of the road glowing generalities will not win student respect.

The causes for apathymay be deeper. The pressures of the trimester
system may be too great. The orientation program may not orient stu-
dents towards activities. Or the entire outline for student affairs at the
University may be outdated. Whichever may be the dominant cause, it
remains the duty of students and student affairs ‘administrators to_act,
not merely talk, on the apathy -problem.

The students of the University

Editor, The Pitt News:
I have just read your edition

dated‘ Nov. 12. To say that there’

is some unrest among your stu-
dent body concerning everything
from football. to ﬁnancesto fra-
ternities_ would bean understate-
ment. ’

I think half of your problems
would be solyed if you would
just realize that the University
of Pittsburgh is a small time uni-

versity and cannot compete on .

the same scale as the larger uni-
versities. . I ,

Your ‘University has only ten
fraternities, but the way they re-
sent each other, it would seem
that they are high school frater-
nities rather than organizations
of adults.

I think the‘ trouble with your

whole football system can be

summed up in one word: Mich-

‘elosen. You need a good, respect-

ed coach that the boys will play
for. A coach that knows his play-

_ ers and talks to them. One thing

Michelosen is -not noted for.
The reason that you only got

16 football recruits is not, only

due to your losing records. Not

' too many students want to go to

a city school which beasts of its
sophistication and privacy on one
hand, but whose students dress
and act like adolescents rather
than adults, and a university that

is not too pri_Vate,. to ‘accept $10_

million from 'the state, but does
not want to be called a state
school. . i

The administration and stu-

dents of the University or Pitts-
burgh are kidding only them-,

' selves because it is obvious to
outsiders that the University of
V Pittsburgh isn't everything that

it would like people to believe.

.By BILL JEROME

Losers of the world, unite; you
have nothing to lose. Take the
next streetcar to the Fulton and
see Agent Harry Palmer in The
Ipcress File, the latest and most
realistic approach to‘the girls-
and-glitter world of the secret
agent.

Realistic because Harry Palm-
er is human, one of us. He’s sort
of an apprentice James Bond
because he’s still learning the
trade and, unlike Bond, his ap-
peal is based on the fact that he
makes so many simple mistakes.
Harry Palmer is the “Avis Mo-

tif” expressed in a spy ﬁlm; he,

has to try harder, because he’s
only number two, not 007. He’s
what we would be if we were a
secret agent.

But Harry’s life isn't dull com-
pared to Bond, only more re-
ﬁned. He digs Mozart, books, and
cooking, and, of course, likes
“girls best.” But he seems less
natural whistling at a passing
secretary than does Bond, who
never has to scan the horizons
for companionship.

Harry is out of character kick-
ing doors open, and more at home
forgetting to shut them. He does-
n’t run to turn off his alarm
clock. He grinds his own coffee,
and even sports a Band-aid (or
should we say Bond-la-id?), which
is probably the aftermath of die-
ing an onion.

But Harry, who is played by
Michael Caine, is just about as
dashing in his own heady way as

  
  
  
 

Holmes than Buck Rogers as he
joins the search for an eminent
scientist whose talents are being
used by Communist Albania to
develop a “proton-proton scatter-
ing device,” the only Bondian
gadget in the ﬁlm.

This is where Harry human-
izes himself; he is fallible. He is
the ﬁrst of his group of agents
to contact the enemy———which is
good—but Harry lets them get
away—which
gets mad at him. “You idiot!” he
screams at Harry, something
007’s boss would never do. Harry
shrugs it off, and goes back to
work. How could you not like
this guy?

He makes a few other mis-
takes before the. ﬁlm ends, but
Harry winds up the hero. The
pace and action aren’t on as
colossal a scale as in the Bond
ﬁlms, but then, what else is? And
this may be the only knock
against the film by seasoned 007
fans-—the action is too placid and
too plausible, compared to Band.

When Harry and a colleague
walk down an aisle in a super-
market, for example, they cut
each other off with their shop-
ping carts. The spy-ﬁlm fan senses
that Harry will push a button on
the cart, which will then emit a
smoke-screen and an oil slick
while Harry is quickly ejected
into the check-out line. But the
whole‘ thing never comes off.

Caine is reportedly committed
to two more Harry Palmer ﬁlms.

should tell producer Harry Saltz-
man whether to keep emphasiz-
ing Harry’s human qualities or
add more gadgets‘ and girls. And
since Saltzman is co-producer of
the Bond ﬁlms, the temptation
may prove to be too much. But
as it now stands, ﬁlms like Ip-
cress seem to be more down-to-
earth appeal, even if they fail to
put Bond fans in 007th Heaven.

For Train Trip

Pi Lambda Phi President Har-
vey Kopeldwitz took a long ride
Saturday night; The Pi Lam
pledges kidnapped him at the
fraternity party and put him on
the train to St. Louis, Missouri.

Explaining how it was done,
Howard Brownstein, president of

the pledge class, said that they *

put “knock—out” drops in his
drink at the party and six pledges
spirited him away.

When Kopeldwitz saw how
serious the pledges were, he of-
fered to go willingly “if you beat
Phi Eps in the pledge football
game.” Promising to do so, the
pledges saw him board the 1 a.m.
train. Some of the active broth-
ers who had discovered the plot
tried to prevent his departure,
but Kopeldwitz said: “I’m going
willingly. Write to me.”

Kopeldwitz immediately fell
asleep in his ﬁrst-class accommo-
dations and woke up at 12:30
p.m. in St. Louis. He spent the
day at the fraternity chapter at
Washington University and ﬂew
back at his own expense Sunday
evening. I

Meanwhile the Pi Lam pledges
won their game.

Seven University Students

((L'or2tim(c(1 from Page 2)
said, “You ﬁnd yourself trying to
prove that you’re different from
the typical tourist.”

Two of the seven students,
Arla Jean Anderson and Howard
Brilliant who are both from the
School of Engineering, had a ,dif.
ferent kind of scholarship. Their
scholarship. the Emitt, which de-
frays the cost of travel, is de-
signed for engineering students
who want to work in Europe.
This is compared to the other ﬁve
scholarships which are designed
to defray the cost of travel and
study in Europe. ~Miss Anderson
worked in the Aerospace Insti-
tute of Madrid, Spain. Howard
worked in an aeronautical engi-
neering research ﬁrm in Holland.
How does the European engineer
differ. from the American engi-
neer. Brilliant said there was lit-
tlc difference: “I associated most-
ly with engineers in Holland and
I’ll say that the European engi-
neer is just like his American
counterpart.”

The students said that they fre-
quently found themselves being
asked questions about America
that they couldn’t answer. Charles
Chadwick was asked many times,
“If America is the greatest coun-
try in the world, why is it that
they have poor people? Germany
isn’t as rich and there are no

poor people here. Why do you
have so many problems if you’re
so great?” Another example of
this unanswerable type question
was given by Bev Reifman. “In
Europe so many people came up
to me and asked me why Amer-
ica thought that it was the sa-
vior of Mankind?”

The students made sure to get
across the point that the Euro-
pean countries have their own
problems in such ﬁelds as racial
relations, etc. The major differ-
_ence, however, is that the Euro-
peans are free to admit their mis-
takes, while, “the Americans feel
they can’t make a mistake.”

Maybe it might be a good idea
if we all started acting a little
more like the intellectuarally
aware European student who’s
not afraid to search for his an-
swers. ‘

A LOGICAL CHOICE

THE DENIALS and “no comments” are more numer-
ous at the Fitzgerald Field House than at a Senate subcom-
- mittee investigation of Robert Shelton. Although everyone

is taking the ﬁfth amendment concerning the status of John
Michelosen, the predictors are still deciding who will take
his place if and when he resigns or is ﬁred. _ .

At the beginning of the year Bud Wilkinson visited the
“Field House to talk to Frank Carver about the upcoming
gtelevised game with Duke. Carver assured everyone at that
. time, that the televising of the game was the only reason
‘he was talking to Wilkinson. _ .

It would be silly for Wilkinson to come to Pitt. He is

completely satisfied with his well paying job with the Na-
tional Broadcasting Company. He is also debating whether
V to delve into politics again. It is improbable for Wilkinson
or any really big name coach to come to this University un-
less the salary was much more enticing. '

WHO ELSE would come here? The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette mentioned the name of Vic Fusia, an alumnus and
the presently successful coach of the University of Massa-
chusetts. Fusia has proved by his ability to pull boys from

. this area to the New England school, that he would be the
logical choice.“-

Another speculative choice might be a successful
WPIAL coach from this area. There are several excellent
coaches who are young and dynamic and would be able to
get the football players .from Western Pennsylvania.

Getting the stars from this section is the main purpose
in making a change. If a man is hired who is not familiar

*with this area it may take him too long to save the situa-
tion. Although it is a big jump from the WPIAL to big
time football, it may not be a bad idea and a high school
* coach couldn't demand a large salary, an important variable
when coaches are being considered here.

A perio. This is a perennial name on the lips of all Pittsburg -
-ers who are familiar with Dimperio’s record at Westing-

_ house High School.

; Although a great coach, Dimperio wants to stay at
Westinghouse where helcan work with Negro boys who don't

_ have a good chance of getting into colleges. He somehow

finds a school for them to play ball at and enjoys doing this

. more than even coaching. ’

‘ _/ If a new coach is ‘here next year he will have to be

hired very soon. The season ends tomorrow and that means

immediately. Decisions will have to be made quickly to
start things, moving in the right direction for Pitt football.

3 # Q .

e GET THEIR KICKS
ALTHOUGH THE SOCCER TEAM has been reported
to have hung Frank Carver in effigy before the Bucknell
game last Saturday the reports aren’t true. One of the
players made a dummy with old sweat pants and sweatshirts
but after a meeting they decided against a hanging.

_ To get their kicking toes in shape they planted a, few
swift kicks into the model and worked themselves up for the
game. The players were a little angered at Carver’s refusal
to let them play at the stadium. This forced the booters to‘
play at inadequate Kennard ﬁeld.

Cgrab   NCA A B6

By GEORGE LIES

“Welcome to Bidsville” read the sign in the
locker room after the soccer team found out they
received an NCAA bid.

Too many things happened to make this sea-
son a losing one for the soccer team. NCAA bids
weren’t even considered. Yet, with a record of
seven wins, one loss, and one tie, next Monday
at Pitt Stadium, they meet East Stroudsburg (10-1)
in the ﬁrst round of the National Collegiate Soc-
cer Championship.

Before the season began, soccer coach Leo Be-
mis lost »a man who would have been the starting
goalie. He was a 25-Year-old sophomore named
Klaus Schmid. With this loss, Bemis looked to
two inexperienced players to man the position.

Ed Zelnick ﬁlled the spot until he allowed four
goals in the booters’ single loss to West Chester.
Then along came Lou Cepanec. Since that time
the defense have given up only four goals in sev-
en games. “

After solving the goaltender problem, Bemis
still faced other question marks. Injuries struck
the wing positions. At ﬁrst they tried to play at
half at half strength, but ﬁnally A1 Traunsteiner
and Aldo Zortea turned. in their spikes for the
year.

Bemis platooned forward lines until he lost
the two senior wings. After that, he combined the
two lines and came out with one solid contingent.
This line doesn't score many goals and each one
they do score requires a lot of work on their part.
However, a high scoring team isn’t needed with
such‘ a stingy defense. I ~

Dave Shaffer, who played the bench, last year,
leads the team with ﬁve goals and two assists at
the center forward position. Sal Tavares with
three goals and one assist, and Ferd Sauer, one
goal, three assists, have taken over the right and
left wing posts. At the rover slot, Dom Milillo has
contributed two goals and two assists. '

 

Official 'notication of the NCAA bid elated the
players‘ but at the beginning of the year, the
thought was obscure. This was especially true
after the soccermen carried a 1-1-1 record into
the Kent State contest.

“After the 1962 season when the team got into
the NCAA’s, I always thought about a bid before
the start of each new season,” said halfback George
Sommer, “but both years we were five and ﬁve.
This year it didn’t enter my mind until we beat
Ohio U.”‘ '

In the ﬁnal Saylor Point ratings, the booters
placed third behind West Chester and East Strouds—
burg. In the NCCA Soccer Tournament, the num-
ber one and number three teams playoff. The
winner meets the winner of the Michigan State
(Midwest No. 2 team) —Baltimore (South No. 2)
game. West Chester (N. J.-Pa.-Del. No. 2) meets
Navy (South No. 1). v .

Navy’s undefeated soccer team won the 1964
NCAA Championship, edging runnerup Michigan
State, 1-0. St. Louis and Army placed third. This
year the championship game will be played in
St. ‘Louis. '

Led by Jim Cuddy, the “best captain in a. long
time,” according to Bemis, the soccer team meets
its toughest competition .of the season in East
Stroudsburg. Last year Stroudsburg lost one game.
That came against Michigan State, 4-0, in the
NCAA’s. Before‘ that, they trampled ' over .13
straight opponents. With six’ shutouts, they cut-
scored three opponents, 58-11. , - 1

“Our team this _ year is not as good as last
year’s,”‘ said Stroudsburg coach John Eiler. “We
lost five men from last season. Ourteam shows
a balanced attack with no top stars and com-
pared to our opposition, physically we are small.

West Chester, the team who victimized the boot-
ers (4-1), also tacked the lone loss (3-0) to Strouds-
burg’s 11'game schedule.

records all season. Tomor-

John Steigman’s pupils who
Will get their chance to put
their mark in the Panther record
book. v '

If Penn State in Saturday’s 1:30
p.m. game at the stadium scores’
10 or more points, Steigman, who
is only in his ﬁrst year here, will
have the glorious but question-
able distinction of having tutored
the most scored upon unit , in
gridder history.

The record was set at 293
points in 1944. This year’s team
has. given up 284 points ~ in the
nine games thus far.

Whether the record is broken
or'not will depend more on the
mood of the Nittany Lions than
on the play of Steigman’s “Ra-
hads.” State is the nation’s eighth
(best team in total oﬁense, aver-
aging 356 yards a game, but most
of their time has been spent in
marching up and down the ﬁeld
without crossing the goal line.

Despite their offensive produc-
tion, the Lions have only been

touchdowns a game which is one

of the reasons for their just hav-

ing a.4-4 record. State must reg-
ister wins over both the Pan-

thers tomorrow and Maryland‘

next week if it is to ﬁnish up

with its 27 consecutive winning .

season, the longest streak in the
nation. -

“They could be 7-1 right now
just as easily as they are 4-4,”
said Darrell. Lewis, ‘-who has
scouted the Lions. “They have as
good a football team as any I’ve
seen all year. It’s just that mis-
fortune has come their _way.

“It’s going to be a tough game
tomorrow,” said Lewis. “But then
again it's Pitt-Penn State and
anything can happen.”

If the fans can’t be certain of

what to expect tomorrow at least-
Lucas, will have a pretty good

idea of what will be ‘coming his
way——the Lion defensive line. '
If statistics were kept on the

amount of times a quarterback is

dropped behind the line of scrim--
mage by a blitzing defense, Lu-

“State will most likely resort
to the blitz to put pressure on

Kenny,” said coach John Mich-

elosen. ‘ 1
Despite the poor protection an

signal caller only needs 86 yards
tomorrow to set a new record
for total oifense in one seaeson.

The current mark is 1595 yards

set in 1963 by Fred Mazurek, who
was directing a 9-1 team.

State also features a passing
quarterback in Jack’ White. His

1120 yards passing is a new Lion_

record for one season. But he has
also been getting nearly all ‘the
time he could ask for to throw
the ball. Navy threw White" for a

is quite a different story than

F rosh Cagers Meet Varsity
In Hall of Fame Benefit

The Panther varsity bas-
ketball team plays the fresh-
man squad Monday, Novem-
ber 22 at the Fitzgerald
Field House for the benefit
of the National Basketball

Hall of Fame.

Admission to the game will be
50 cents except for students, who
need just their identiﬁcation
cards. Tap-oﬁ is slated for.8 p.m.

The varsity willgbe built aruond
lettermen Larry Szykowny at
guard, Bob Lovett at forward,
and center Jim LaValley.

Two newcomers will be start-
ing for the varsity, sophomore
forward Ken Bollens and former

‘footballer Pete Smith at guard.

Last year’s Panthers ﬁnished
with a 7-16 record. However, a
more sensible schedule which in-
cludes more home games and
fewer’ contests against such pow-.-
ers as Wichita should enable the
hoopsters to fare_ much better
this season. ' 

Although there hasn’t been a A

 franc is lcal currency in Tahiti. 1

So is this.)

 

strong buildup, this year’s frosh
crop looks like the best since
1960 when such former Panther
stars as Brian Generalovich, Dave
Sauer, and Calvin Sheffield were
freshmen. The basketball coaches

have reached as far away as. '1
Tulsa, Oklahoma, to recruit ball-
players. '

This is the first time a game
of this type has been held here. It

is hoped that it can become an
annual event.
