Discusses Daydreaming

Although most people accept it as a
well-known fact, Dr. Laurence F.
Shaffer, assistant professor of psy-
chology a.t the Carnegie Institute of
Technology, is, as far as he knows,
the ﬁrst person to investigate the nor-
mality of daydreaming among college
students.

Dr. Shaﬁer will present the results
of this study today at 4:30 o'clock to
the Psychology Forum, which meets
in Room 308, Alumni Hall.

He will also present a case study of
a phobia. Dr. George E. Jones, pro-
fessor of psychology, is chairman of
the forum,

Dr. Geise Finishes Syllabus

Of ‘History

Of Civilization’

 

The two weighty volumes used in
History 1 and 2 have ﬁnally found an

interpreter. Dr. John J. Geise, as-
sistant professor of history, has re-
cently completed his “Syllabus for
Barnes’ The History of Western Civil-
ization.”

Commenting on the work Dr. Geise
says in his preface: “One of the ma-
jor problems of the historian lies in
the extracting of intelligible general-
ization from the multitude of facts in
the historical record. The same dif-
ficulty confronts the college
student when he takes up his ﬁrst ad-
vanced text on the history of civiliza-
tion.

“The pedagogical problem which
this syllabus sets for itself is to adapt
the very satisfactory work of Dr.
Barnes to the capacities of the aver-
age college freshman . . . It has been
concluded that the most efficient
guide will be one which presents, in
the order followed by the text itself,
clear and complete statements of the
major conclusions that must be drawn
from careful study of the work by a
competent student."

- The syllabus has grown out of the
materials used in Dr. Geise’s His-
tory I course. Approached by Har-
court, Brace and Co., publishers of
Barnes’: “I-Iistory," he undertook the
work of presenting an outline of the

History. The syllabus will be publish-
ed this summer,

Dr. Geise claimed that the pur-
pose of the outline is “an attempt‘ to
make what in my Opinion is the best
history of western civilization more
usable to the student.” The syllabus
will appear in two parts, each to ac-
company one volume of Barnes and to
cover one semester’s work. It consists
of four divisions: analysis of the text,
chronologic listings of the more impor-
tant facts, map studies, and discussion
questions.

The author of the syllabus has car-
ried on an active correspondence w'th
Dr. Barnes and has known him for
some years. In his opinion, Dr.
Barnes’ book has ﬁlled a need in his-
torical research. “It is an excellent
work,” Dr. Geise said.

The need for the syllabus is evident.
Barnes “History” covers nearly 2,000
pages and more than 500,000 years of
civilization, and the student, attempt-
ing to realize the force of the survey,
is bewildered by the mass of mate-
rial. The syllabus should serve to cor-
relate the pages of information into a
compact and understandable concep-
tion.

Dr. Barnes’ book was put/into use
here last September. Realizing the
need for the outline, Dr, Geise began
working onihls syllabus in December.

_It will be ready for use next semester.

Senior Ball-Goers
Will Hear Dailey
For Final Dance

Virginia Sepp, Charles Ebert Plan
To Lead March; Programs,
Scotties To Be Favors

Senior da.nce-goers in the class of
1936 line up for their ﬁnal Grand
March as undergraduates Friday night
in the main ballroom of the Hotel
Schenley. Frank Da1ley’s 14—piece Co-
lumbia Broadcasting orchestra will
supply the music for the ﬁnal major
dance of the year.

Not only the seniors but other uh-
dergraduates will attend the year’s
social ﬁnale, Frank Dailey, now en-
gaged in his annual spring road trip,
w.ll stop on‘ in Pittsburgh long enough
to provide the farewell swing.

Daile_y’s music, which has beenga
hit during the winter months in
the Meadowbrook Club on the out-
skirts of Newark, New Jersey, is
rated among the top dance bands in
the country. '

Virginia Sepp, C35, a veteran dance-
goer, stages a come—back when she
teams up with Chairman Charles
Ebert, Jr., to lead the Grand March at
the affair. “Ginny,” as an under-
graduate, served on many dance com-
mittees for background, in ad_d‘.tiou
to playing an important part in other
campus activities.

Appel Business Manager

The Senior Ball queen listed among
her undergraduate activities: Delta
Delta Delta, president; member of
Mortar Board; and Senior Mentor,

Ralph Appel, BA, business mana-
ger, has not decided just who Lad_y
No. 2 in the March will be. However,
he promises she will also be a “Pitt
girl, and probably an undergraduate,"

Included in the ticket price of $2.50
is a novel favor-program combination.
Pinned on the front cover of the gold
program is a black scotty dog pin, and
according to Business Manager Ap-
pel “just the thing to complete that
‘cute pin’ collection for the ladies.”

Dancing starts at 10 o’clock, with
the Grand March scheduled to begin
at 11:30 o’clock. At this time, pro-
grams and favors wil be distributed.

Mr. and Mrs. C. Stanton Belfour,
Captain and Mrs. Donald C. Treden-
nick, and Mr. and Mrs. Theodore W.
Biddle will be chaperons for the
dance. Mr_ Balfour is assistant di-
rector of University Extension Divi-
sion and of the Summer Session, Cap-
tain Tredennick is assistant professor
of military science and tactics, and
Mr. Biddle is assistant dean of men.

 

‘Going Up I’ Index
Of Local Business

Continues To Rise

Once again the index of general
business activity has started to rise
and again it has reached a new high
level for the recovery period, The
Bureau of Business Research in its
weekly report of business conditions
in the Pittsburgh district announced
the index as standing at 87.4.

Industrial production showed a gain
on the index of three per cent, due
largely to the advance in electric
power sales and coal production. Steel
mill operations in the district declin-
ed slightly, but operations of the mills
have held up remarkably well so far
this year, according to the Bureau.

Originating shipments also fell off
Slightly. The decrease was said to
be due to smaller carloadings of iron
and steel products and of miscellane-
ous freight. Coal and coke loadings
rose slightly and river shipments re-
flected a moderate gain.

The combined volume of trade in-
creased decidedly, the adjusted index
T131118 from 93.3 in the week ended
May 2 to 104.1 for the week ended
May 9. Department store sales were
the most signiﬁcant in the rise of this
index.

Romance, Work,
Library Feaiu red
In Last Panther

According to press blurbs released
by the circulation department, the last
issue of the Panther, coming out Wed-
nesday, will be the best.

One of the leading stories is “Mem-
ories of a Librarian,” by Alan C.
Lloyd, Ed36, and erstwhile library as-
sistant.

Following is “A Plea For Romance,”
by Robert Saffron, C38. the second
half of the Cap and Gown combination.
The author claims it to be “a scathing
denunciation of park guards who in-
fringe on the constitution rights of
American manhood and womanhood.”

Karl W. Punzak, C38, helps out grad-
uating seniors with his “‘Threat of
VVo1'k.” Vlfhat with better times and
prosperity, unsuspecting alumni-to-be
will bless the plan to avoid jobs,
claims Punzak. '

James R. Donoghue submitted “ln
The Beginning,” and it was accep-ted.
He tells of the doings of the ﬁrst tri-
angle, Eve, Adam, and Lilith.

William R. Murray, C39, has con-
tributed “Selected Verse.” He has
tied up well-known bits of poetry into
a single poem.

As a special feature, the Panther
Prowler will be revealed in Wednes-
day’s issue.

The monthly magazine will contain
all the regular features of more cam-
pus leaders, style columns, and ex-
change jokes.

Council Prepares
Possible Program
For Coming Year

Majchrzak Names Five Chairmen
To Head Committees Provided
By Men’s Constitution

Characterized by long and serious
discussion, the meeting of Men’s Coun-
cil at the Cathedral Mansions VVednes-
day evening produced a tentative pro-
gram which the organization will at-
tempt to put into effect next semes-
ter.

Appointed by Florian Majchrzak,
E37, president, were ﬁve chairmen of
four committees which have deﬁnitely
been set up according to its constitu-
tion approved by SFA in April.

Succeeding Majchrzak and VV. Gor-
don Rauck, C37, as co-chairmen of the
men's customs committee will be Lou-
is Bearer, E37, and Paul. Jennings,
C37. They will continue the work
with incoming freshmen as begun this
year by Charles IHerald, C36. Includ-
ed in their prospective plans will be
buttons for new men, later more at-
tractive pins, and ﬁnally, after exam-
ination and eliminations, the presen-
tation of plaques to approximately
one-seventh of the freshman class.

Committee On Policy

A second committee, characterized
by N. Robert Seidle, assistant dean
of men and Men’s Council adviser, as
perhaps the most important part of
the program yet set up, will be head-
ed by Elmer Schriber, BA37. This is
the committee on policy and study
which will determine wh.a.t projects, if
any, Men’s Council can supervise and
control. It has power to call a con-
venient meeting in which the project
could be discussed.

As head of the proposed student
loan committee, Majclirzak has se-
lected John Glasser, BA38. The pur-
pose here is to set up a men’s loan
fund resembling the WSGA institu-
t'on, with present plans indicating
that funds may be obtained from the
Student Chest. According to Seidle,
the completion of this idea will take
“quite a. while.”

Council Self-Perpetuating

Charles Rogers, C37, will be chair-
man of the committee on constitutions
which will attempt to revise certain
particulars of the present bill which
James Nicholas, E36, and his Men’s
Council committee drew up earlier in
the year.

Speakers were Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men, and Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant dean of men. Others.
who were called upon included Seidle,_
Nicholas, and Howard lLutz, C36, Leo-
Ryan, C37, Frank Engel, E38, and Paul»
Kohberger, C38, members of the orig-
inal Men’s Council committee.

According to an interpretation of‘
the constitution, the council will be
self-perpetuating to this extent: the
senior members of the council may,
by atwo-thirds majority, elect half
the present underclass membership to
a second term. This means that a
maximum of four members of this
year’s group may be re-elected.

J. C. Reed Returns To Law
Teaching In Bizad School

James C, Reed, professor of Busi-
ness Law, will resume his active du-
ties as a member of the School of Bus-
iness Administration faculty at the
summer session of the University, re-
turning after a twoyear leave of
absence.

The leave was granted to him when
it was found that he had to undergo
a minor operation. He has spent
most of the time in Florida recuperat-
ing and resting.

Students Vote Straight Ticket
On ‘lsm’ Question In Pitt Poll

“Should school teach facts about

all forms of government, including
Communism, Fascism, and Social-
ism?”

By a unanimous vote University
students decided that schools should,
according to the ﬁnal results of the
survey conducted on the campus by
The Pitt News last week. The poll
was held in conjunction with The
‘Pittsburgh Press and the American
Institute of Public Opinion.

Throughout the city, college students
at four other schools also voted on
the question_ In everyday school the
votes were overwhelmingly in favor
of factual instruction about the vari-

ll ii

ous ~—isms. The percentages were:
Pennsylvania Collegy For Vvomen,
98; Duquesne University, 98; Mount

Mercy, 86; and Carnegie Institute of
Technology, 80'.

All in all, though, the ﬁgures for
the ﬁve school averaged slightly over
92 per cent, which is more than a. rea-
sonable majority.

Various comments were written in
on the Pitt Poll ballots. One uncertain
individual, instead of marking the
customary “X” on his ballot, Wrote
“Perhaps" in the "Yes” space. In
another ballot a student wrote: “This
question is obviously a silly one to
put to college students.”

This week The News continues
with the poll on the child labor
amendment. Early balloting on the
question indicates that a substantial
majority of students on the campus
are heartily in favor of an amend-
ment to the Federal Constitution pro-

hibiting or regulating the labor of
persons under 18 years of age, feeling
that state attempts at regulation have
not been effective.

Some years ago Congress passed a
resolution to amend the Constitution
in order to give the national govern-
ment the power to draft suitable

‘child labor legislation, but so far only

some 20 states have ratiﬁed the res-
olution_ Thirty-six states must ratify
the resolution before it becomes law.
Amending the Constitution, according
to most authorities on government, is
the only method by which Congress
can control child labor, the Supreme
Court having thus far denied the two
previous attempts of Congress to leg-
islate on the question through the
commerce and the taxing power.

Ballot boxes will be at the follow-
ing places on the campus: Thaw Hall,
Alumni Hall_ State Hall, and Cathe-
dral (lobby and Room 709). Students
are asked to ﬁll in the ballot which ap-
pears below, and deposit it in one of
the boxes. The results of the poll
will be published in The News next
Monday.

PITT POLL BALLOT

Do you favor an amendment to
the Constitution giving Congress
the power to limit, regulate, and
prohibit the labor of persons under

18?

tudent Opinion
S
an AMAZING RESULTS shown in last week's poll
of Student Opinion, conducted by The News in con-
junction with the American Institute of Public Opinion
and the Pittsburgh Press, is surprising and .':1‘atif3’iI1s~

When an issue can receive a unanimous vote in an in-
stitution such as this University with as argumentative
and over-propogandized a. subject as “Shall We teach
Comulunisni. Fa.scis1n_ and Socialism in our colleges and
universities,” and that that unanimous suDD0i't Shmlid be
favorable is gratifying to those having iibemi Views-

A ,n.ajO,.ity of votes for the proposition might have
been forecast, but unanimous aDD1‘0Val. being 50 hard to
get even in minor things, speaks loads for the liberal
views of students here.

The administration has been accused of having a reac-
tionary political and educational philosophy. Perhaps
some of the criticism is deserved. In fact, the censure
administered by the AAUP was so drastic that it can
hardly be ignored. It would be expected, however, that
if the administration were as reactionary as has been
said, then the student body would begin to take on the
same hue. This is usually the case. The administration
in some schools controls the faculty to such an extent
that there is a complete ban on free speech in the class-
room. Those people who villify the administration must
give it credit for one thing. A professor here is $iV'€i1
complete freedom of expression in class. .

At the Intercollegiate Conference on Government, held
in Harrisburg several weeks ago, it was noticed that the
students holding the extreme reactionary and conserva-
tive opinions were those from the small state schools,
those schools which are known to permit little freedom
of the faculty in class, but which are so small as not to
cause too great :1 fuss with the august AAUP. It tends
to resolve itself into a vicious circle. You start with ‘d
reactionary administration: You get a reactionary fac-
ulty: Your students are reactionary.

The ‘University administration should feel very proud
of its students’ stand on allowing free speech in polit-
ical matters in the classroom. It reflects an inkling of
liberalism on them. The circle can work counter clock-
wise, too. You have liberal students: You must have a
liberal faculty: Your administration must be liberal.
‘The administration should see that student opinion re-
mains liberal.—M. R.

The New Editors

E THOUGHT YOU might like to see the men who

will establish rt precedent at the University in being
-co-editors of The News. Their pictures, along with that
of David Racusin, business manager, are on page 1 of
this issue.

Edwin Beachler and ‘William Trosen have been given
the most responsible position on the campus. It will be
up to then-‘. to establish friendly relations with the ad-
ministration on one hand: some of the students on the
other, If they can reconcile the two they will have done
a good job. ‘

They will be criticized: they will be praised. Dance
chairmen who fail to receive what is, in their opinion,
adequate publicity (their idea of adequate is usually
quite cockeyed) will be down on The News. Those clubs
and campus organizations who feel that their particular
group is not being given enough publicity will be down
on The News. Those departments of the University which
feel that their particular stories have been slighted or
that mistakes have been made in copy submitted by re-
porters will be down on The News. Soon the poor
Beacl1ler—Trosen combine will begin to feel that every-
one is down on The News.

That is probably the most diﬁicult part of editing a
college paper. The technical side will be well-taken care
of, as  usually the case after a man has had several
years’ experience in make-up and in judging news values.
But the co—edito1's will 3‘-.a‘.'e to realize, and early, that
they can't please everyone. They have their own con-
victions uud they must stick by them. Their editorial
policy will have to be based on what they really believe.
Their news stories will have to be judged according to
real news values, Their job is a. difficult one. It calls
for reams of discretion and tact. The new editors, we
think, have it.-——M. R.

The ﬁrst semester honor roll, announced today, con-
tains the same number of names that it did last year.
Vt-'ell, it's the rare business that hasn’t been satisﬁed to
hold its own lately.

One of the government's new projects is to develop ‘a.
smaller-sized turkey for apartment house ovens. This
may cost the Democrats the vote of those folks who like
lots of stuffing-

Grades Make The ODK Man

MICRON DELTA KAPPA, one would judge from re-

cent news items, is rather an exclusive organiza-
tion. The men’s honorary activity fraternity will line up
for the start of the season next fall with an undergrad-
uate contingent consisting of exactly four members.

‘We are probably safe in saying that never in the two
decades of the University Circle’s existence has it not
been able to muster a bigger aggregation than :1 quartet
of undergraduate members when the roll is called. Ob-
viously, the question arises, “What's going on here?”

It’s not that the men students aren't getting them-
selves mixed up in enough activities, not by a hundred
or more. The real catch in the proposition lies In the
recent legislation ODK passed which made a quality
point average of 1.39 the requirement for all candidates
to the society. This change constituted a jump from
1.0, the previous minimum scholastic average, and
crossed off quite a few prospective members from the
election lists.

There are few who will criticize ODK for raising its
scholastic requirement. After all, something better than
a “C” average may be expected from those who are
recognized as outstanding campus leaders. That puts
the issue squarely up to the activities men and makes
it hnperative that they hustle around and get some good
grades if they are at all ODKey-minded. They might re-
member that the graduating members of the organiza-
tion this year have an aggregate average of better than
1.8.

This advice might well be accepted without delay by
the freshmen and sophomores who have activities ambi-
tions. The time to pile up those high scholastic aver-
ages is right now. When the top spots in campus or-
ganizations are reached along about the junior year,
the scholastic burden takes on suflicient proportion gen-
erally to prevent any great rise in the quality point
average. The popular belief that students who have
more or less prominent positions in activities get a little
more of a “break” on the blueprints is nothing more
than a myth. And, brothers and sisters, that is a state-
ment which we feel amply qualiﬁed to defend.

The ambitious underclassmen might, then, be encour-
aged to put a little more on the ball when they bear
down for the coming ﬁnals and polish oﬁ the just-about
due term papers. Just as an army moves on its stom-
ach, an activities man generally moves into ODK on the
strength of a fat ﬁrst and second-year quality point
average, the only difference being that later he is tap-
ped and not shot.

Undoubtedly the fall tapping ceremony will see the
honorary’s undergraduate ranks augmented to a consid-
erable extent. In the meantime, ODK might adopt the
theme, if not the words of a one-time popular song——
“It Don’t Mean A Thing If You Ain't Got Those Grades.”
That might make up into a pretty fair quartet number.

One Less Petition
EFORE PUTTING THE HONORARY societies into
the mothballs for the summer and letting them
alone, perhaps a word to the Druid boys would not be
amiss.

The Druid organization has in the past few years come
a long way from the faction-ridden bunch which contin-
ually got itself in hot water, formed number one and
two-column lead stores for The News, and made “Druid
plum” a household word.

It would be foolish to deny that the fraternity groups
are still in there pitching when the election times come‘
around. But it certainly is true that they have loosened
up enough to give the independent boys a pretty fair
break. ' .

However, one of the products in the system to
strengthen respect for the fraternity now appears to
have outlived its usefulness and should be cast aside.
That is the business of having candidates submit peti-
tions, signed by ﬁve recognized activity leaders and con-
taining a. character recommendation written and signed
by one of these.

Whether or not it is a good idea for freshmen to be
thus encouraged to “toot their own horns” and whether
or not such :1 business is ethical anyway, this need not
be considered. The criticism remains that leaders of
the various activities are forced to assign a couple of
nights out of the year to writing recommendations for
applicants from their activity. Also, the criticism re-
mains tliat you can't write a bad recommendation and
you can hardly refuse the request of a beginner in
your activit_v, no matter what his record has been, if it
appears he may some time develop into a more valuable
worker.

Obviously the petition idea was instituted to make
sure that no possibilities would be overlooked in future
elections at that time when the organization made its
move to clean house and command a little more respect.
But after seeing the thing in action for several years,
even those who were formerly its most enthusiastic
backers can see that the system falls far short of the
successful methods used by other campus honoraries.

Getting a list of outstanding freshmen in campus ac-
tivities from their respective heads, and forming a com-
mittee to boil down this material and arrange it, should
give Druids enough of a working margin for their elec-
tions. Likewise, the list of freshman plaque recipients
could be used. There wouldn’t be many deserving fresh-
men passed up by this plan and it would get rid of that
bothersome business of petitions. There is something
to be said for the fact that after running around for a
week with a petition the freshman may get some ideas
and then be a touch more disappointed when he isn’t
tapped.

The incoming Druids will ﬁnd the stencils for the pe-
titions safely tucked away in Room 801, Cathedral. We
hope they will leave them there.

Book Writing‘ Takes Up Slack
In College Professors’ Time

 

Many faculty members of the University, despite the fact that they have
classes to teach and papers to mark, ﬁnd time to write textbooks in their

respective ﬁelds.

The following is an incomplete listing of books written by members of
the faculty. The staff of the department of modern languages has produced
a greater output of literature than any other department.

Dr. Whitford H. Shelton, professor of modern languages, has edited sev-

eral works of famous French authors.¢

Among these are the novel “Les
Oberle” by Rene Bazin, and “Le Fils
de Giboyer,” a play by Emile Augier.
He has also written a grammar,
“Minimum Essentials of French.”
Blossom N. Henry, assistant profes-
sor of modern languages. has edited
another French novel “Etienne May-
ran,” a work of Taine.

In the German division, Dr. J. F. L.
Raschen, professor of modern lan-
guages, has written three books which
are used in language classes. They
are “A German Science Reader,” in
which he collaborated with Erle Fair-
ﬁeld, another professor in the mod-
ern language department, “German
Review Grammar,” and an edition of
“Die Heiteretei,” by Otto Ludwig.

Several books have been written by
M, A. DeVitis, associate professor of
modern languages, whose specialty
is Spanish. One which is widely
used is a “Spanish Gra.mmar.” He has
also edited several other works which
are used intermittently by Spanish
classes,

-Chemists Are Active

Members of the department of
chemistry have also been active in
this respect. Dr. Alexander Lowy,
professor of chemistry, produced, in
collaboration with Benjamin Harrow
of the College of the City of New
York, the book, “Introduction to Or-
ganic Chemistry,” the new fourth edi-
tion of which was released last week.
Dr. Lowy and Vlfilmer E. Baldwin, as-
sistant professor of chemistry, pre-
pared “A Laboratory Book of Organic
Chemistry.” Another manual, “Lab-
oratory Directions in Inorganic Chem-
istry,” was prepared by Dr. Alexander
Silvcrman, head of the department.
The greatest single output in the de-
I-al‘tI1lG'-111; has come from the pen of
Dr. Carl J. Engelder, who has produc-
ed four books, “Elementary Qualita-
tive Analysis,” “Elementary Quantita-
tive Ana.lysis,” “Gas Oil Fuel,” and a
problem book in chemistry.

The text used in Economics 1, (2),
“Economics Backgrounds,” is the
work of Russell A. Dixon and E.
Kingman Eberhart, instructor in
economics. Also on the subject of
economics is “Labor Problems in
American Industry,” the author of
which is Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty,
professor of economics.

The dean of the School of Business
Administration, Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, together with Charles S. Fro-
man, a former colleague at the Uni-
versity of Buffalo, was responsible
for the revised edition of the late

Horace White's “Money and Bank-
ing,” which is used in the ﬁnance
class. Also used in the Business Ad-
ministration School is $“Cost Find-
ing for Engineers,” by C. L. Van
Sickle, assistant professor of account-
ing, and Charles Reitell, a former fac-
ulty member of the University.

Then there is “Reading Aloud,” by
Dr. W. M, Parrish, professor of pub-
lic speaking, and the familiar book-
let, “Study Questions in American Gov-
ernment,” by Dr. J'a.mes C. Charles-
worth, associate professor of political
science.

Dr. Manuel C. Elmer, head of the de-
partment of sociology, has contributed
several books on social problems.
Outstanding among these are “Tech-

Mushball Sluggers Get Set
To Start League Playoffs

 

Final Elimination Contests To Be Played This Afternoon;
Greek Championship Games Begin Tomorrow

 

Just about the same time some of the University’s scholars are
beginning to knuckle down to some real studying, the fraternity
mushballers are beginning to swing those bats in dead earnest. To-
morrow the championship playoffs in the Interfraternity mushball

tournament begin.

Four of the six teams that have qualiﬁed to take part in the
championship chase have already been decided. Qualiﬁcation re-

quisites are a ﬁrst or second place in¢

respective league standings.

Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha Mu,
Lambda Chi Alpha, and Phi Epsilon
are the four winners. Lambda Chi
Alpha and Phi Epsilon Pi ended up
in a tie for ﬁrst place in League C
play, each losing one game.

In (League B, Pi Lambda Phi and
Sigma Alpha Mu both won two games,
assuring themselves of being the two
B bracket representatives. The game
between them for the ﬁrst and second
place rankings was played over the
weekend,

Today's two games, Kappa Sigma-
Phi Kappa and Phi Delta Theta-Pi
Kappa Alpha will determine League
A’s three entries in the playoffs. The
Phi Delts, with three victories against
no losses, lead this League and are
certain entries.

Phi Eps, Lambda Chis Tied

The Phi Ep Wolves, after starting
out poorly, have won their last two
games. Wednesday, they lambasted
Theta Chi, 15-1, and the following day
they followed up with a 19-8 triumph
over Sigma Chi,

Lambda Chi A-lpha made it two up
and one down by shellacking Theta
Chi, 20-6. In tomorrow’s pfayoﬁ they
will meet the winner of League A
which will probably be Phi Delta
Theta.

Scrambling for one of the three
League A qualifying posts are the
Phi Delts, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kap-
pa, and Kappa Sigma. The Delts,
only other League A starter, are def-
initely scratched with a record that
shows three losses.

Kappa Sigs Powerful

Power has been shown by the Kap-
pa Sigma wrecking crew. In defeat-
ing PIKA they rolled up 18 runs in the
ﬁrst inning.

On the other hand, the PiKA outﬁt
has shown great staying abilities.
After handing Phi Kappa a nine-run
lead in the ﬁrst two innings of their
league games Wednesday, they rallied
to take a 20-10 victory. And in the
Kappa Sig game, after the 18-run
deluge, they pulled up to within six
runs of the victors before losing.

The only other game of latter last
week went to Phi Delta Theta, 16-4,
over Delta Tau Delta.

Scanning the scoreboard of the re-
maining Intramural ﬁeld, we can ﬁnd
the Student Alliance way out in front
of the Independent eague. The medi-
cal league title is still a- toss-up, with
the Ruhesers and Caesarians tied for
ﬁrst place,

While the varsity was capturing the
city collegiate tennis title at home
last Friday, the ﬁrst year outﬁt in-
vaded the Mt. Lebanon courts where it

champs, 4-3, in a close match.

The freshmen scored their four

Punning Panther
Net Team ‘Techs’
Plaid Outfit, 7-2

Varsity Wins Thirteenth Straight;
Maddens, Bald, Solow, Megan
Capture Singles’ Matches

By Shorty Long

As Captain Joe Madden would
aptly put it (if I hadn’t thought of it
ﬁrst), the Carnegie Tartans got plaid
in the middle by the Pitt varsity ten-
nis team Friday. Pitt checked them
with a 7-2 score.

Funster Bob Madden took one look
at Frank Hess, Tech ace, and then
hessled up and defeated him 6-1, 6-0.
Meanwhile, Madden’s cohort and
partner in crime, Ralph Bald, whipped
some sizzlers over the net to take
over Billie Miller, the basketball play-
or. 6-3, 6-4. Baldie, by the way, is
showing excellent form in his position
as No. 2 man for Pitt.

Captain ‘Madden Wins

Punster Joe Madden, with effer-
vescent spirits and steady strokes,
whipped the old canvas bubble around
and won 6-3, 6-2 over Paul Games.
That was not so bad.

As for Irwin Solow, ex-Taylor All-
dcrdice ﬂash, he placed the ball So-
low over the net that Dan Goodman,
his Tech opponent, could not easily
at-Tech it, and Irv won, 6-2, 6-4.

“I’sa Mogan” (Johnny Megan),
sometimes known as “Flossie Mae,”
defeated Buzz Greenberg, another
cager, 6-3, 6-3.

Super-punster, Roy Heckler, with-
out the encouragement of his little
mascot and pal, Herbert, lost to
Myers of Tech, 6-4, 6-4. Herbert, by
the way, is a little tow-headed boy

who trails Heck around, even to the

extent of attending his philosophy
class with him, and helping him shoot
paper wads. Usually Herbert, whose
brother has the chickenpox, is in at-
tendance at the tennis matches. But
Friday he was the missing link.

Bob Madden and Bald teamed to-
gether and gambolled ,(or gambled)
about the courts and defeated Green-
berg and Miller, 6-4, 6-1. But Lans-
burg and Hughes of Tech had Joe
Madden a.nd ‘I’sa Megan” going “Uh-
uh, woof-woof” to the tune" of 6-2,
4-6, 6-8.

The ﬁnal match went to Pitt, with
Solow and Bill McKenna whizzing a
6-2, 6-2 victory over Dick Lightcap
and Jack Wagg of Tech.

So there y’ar'e. Tech a look at it.

Golfers To Face
Geneva Linksmen

 

Face Western Reserve Tomorrow,
Notre Dame On Thursday

Back on their home course after
nine matches away, the Panther golf-
ers open a three-match week this aft-
ernoon by shooting against Geneva’s
linksmen on the Alcoma Country
Club course. The match is the sea-
»son’s second in the Pitt-Geneva golf
feud with the Panthers one up on
their Beaver Valley opponents, hav-
ing slammed out a 6-3 triumph earlier
in the season over the Covanenters.

Tomorrow, Art Snyder leads his
linksmen into the city of Cleveland
and a match with the Western Re-
serve golf team. This, too, would be
the second meeting of the season be-
tween the two teams, except that the
weather man objected to the ﬁrst
scheduling. '

On Thursday comes what is label-
ed the feature Panther golf match
of the seasongthat with Notre Dame
on the local Alcoma course. This
match completes the Pitt season.

Seek Revenge Against! Irish

Last year the Irish golfers licked
the Panthers, but with the vast im-
provement in the Pitt team the Sny-
der boys stand a good chance to even
things. With Souchak going at an
unbeatable clip and the rest of the
Panthers improving with every match
the Irish will do well to come here
prepared for the worst.

In the match at Alcoma this after-
noon Coach Snyder will send the same
six players he has relied upon all
season against Geneva. An odd co-
incidence about this match is that
the Panthers will be out again to
bring their season record up to the
.500 mark. In the ﬁrst Pitt-Geneva
match the Panther triumph brought
the mark up to read three victories,
three defeats. If the Panthers win
today, the record will be ﬁve and ﬁve.

The 6-3 verdict that the Panthers
hold over the Genevans doesn’t tell
the whole story of that ﬁrst match.
Both teams won three individual at‘-
fairs but the Panthers were a shade
better in the best ball play, taking
the entire three and the match.

Souchak Undefeated

Frank Souchak, the footballer-golf
er who has received a great deal of
favorable attention from the sport
pages of Panther opponents’ school
papers will be out for his ninth con-
secutive victory of the season. Thus
far, - he is ' undefeated even though
meeting" some of the best collegiate
_ in the eastern part of the
country.

Jayvees Oppose
Bethany Runners
In Finale Today

Coach Potts and 18 Jayvee track
and ﬁeld performers make their third
and ﬁnal start of the spring campaign
on the Bethany track today with od_ds
favoring a Bison victory.

Junior-varsity runners have split
even in the two previous starts, scor-
ing a triumph over Slippery Rock and
dropping a tough ﬁve-point decision
to the Grove City varsity, Although
the Tech varsity defeated the Bethany
boys last week on the Tech track,
74% to 561/2, the losers were impres-
sive in several departments.

.Bry winning the century in 10.1,
Wolff made himself the favorite to
beat the best man on the Panther Jay-
vee squad. He should also take the
220-yard dash.

Bison Horner, who runs the quarter
in the low 50’s, will give Jack McCon-
nell all he can handle in this event,
and will still have enough left to
make things tough in the half mile
run.

Brown is capable of running a ten
minute two-mile, Doepken, a hurdler,
tops the lows and highs in impressive
fashion. John Wood and Redmon
Oden of the Junior-varsity should give
him a good race in the low hurdle
event.

Although the Bisons scored ﬁrsts in
seven of the nine track events against
Tech, they fell down in the ﬁeld
events, taking only the broad jump.

However, the Jayvees show deﬁnite
weakness in this same department,
and therefore the outcome of the
meet should depend on the results of
the ﬁeld events.’

on the Pitt squad will be: Ed Spitz
in the sprints; “Snake” Wood in the
sprints and hurdles; Jack Pfaff, mid-
dle-distance: Rags Radvansky,
weights; Elliott Montroll, middle-dis-
tance; 'McConn‘ell, middle-distance_;
Andy Loncher, distance; Redmon
Oden, jumper and hurdler; Van Ken-

nen, middle-distance.

Ed Spotovich, weights; Sutton,
