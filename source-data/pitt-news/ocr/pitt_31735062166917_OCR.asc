SG Abolition Debate

For Sparse Audience

Unlike much else in the current campaign for Student Gov-
ernment (SG) -off-ices, no surprise proposals were made by the
three candidates for SG president when they met in an Election
Forum Friday. What was said hit only a sparse audience in the
SU Ballroom, and most of these viewers were either senatorial
candidates -or active supporters of one candidate or another.

It was the first public appearance of independent candidate
for SC vice«p-resident, Joe Kociub-es, who replaced Ken Holecko
as running tmat-e to Armand Belly last Wednesday. Kociubes back-
ed Belly’s call for the abolition of SG. “What we suggest is that
people with important issues will work for -these and that their
-legitimacy shouldn’t be hindered by SG,” he said.

George Doperak, United Student A.ssoc~.ia.tion (US-A) presiden-
tial candidate, replied, “SG has reached a turning point, but this
isn’t the time to throw up our hands. Rather, we should make S-G
work through investigation and documentation.”

Postive Action 'I‘e4a.m (PAT)
presidential hopeful Ken S-chuel-
er agreed, “If a car needs re-
pa-ir, replace the part, but don’t
sell the car.” -

To the Belly charges that SG
only perpetuates petty politics,
Schiueler commented, “If stu-
dent le-aders maintain a sense
of values, petty politics will be
out of SG. SG is an institution
to «safeguard this sense of val-
ues. If -there has been petty po-
]Jl‘lZlCS in the past, it has been
the result of a lack of fo-rtistude
on the part of student leaders.

Pitt Breezes Past Missouri

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

Displaying coolness rare-
ly observed under a Pitt
banner, the University’s Col-
lege Bowl team overcame televi-
sion jitters and a stuebsborn Mis-
souri contingent to gain a 235-
185 victory last night in New
York City and the right to re-
turn next week to face the Uni-
versity of Kansas.

Behind by ‘as many as 50
p-oints midway through the sec-
ond half, each member of the
University quartet answered
crucial tossup questions in a
frantic ﬁnish.

Reagan at Mosque

The vocal crowd watching the
program in the Student Union
had resignedly written off Pitt
once Missouri snapped the 95-
95 -halftime deadlock and surged
to a commanding 185-135 ad-
vantage.

But Mike Brourman, who will
probably claim that his buzzer
wasn't functioning during his si-
lent ﬁrst ‘half, seemed to spark
his teammates as he interrupted
moderator Robert Earle with a
decisive answer of “The Wright”
Brothers” to an obscure ques-
tion of place and distance.

Soon after, Kathy Trosan, the
only female on the show, buzzed

WelfarePrograms NeedLimi

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“We’ll spend whatever it
takes to save human beings,
but we’re going to stop de-
stroying them,” declared
Ronald Reagan at the Syria
Mosque Thursday. Reagan.
governor of California, was
in Pittsburgh to speak at a
Republican fund raising
luncheon. '

“We are the only people in
the world whose money goes to
Europe and we can’t,” Reagan
pointed out. “Now we know
what ‘All the way with LBJ’
meant,” he «added.

Reagan stressed the impor-
tance of turning to the people
themselves for the answers to
the nation's problems because
“the Credibility G-ap has become
so great that the government
has admitted it, hopin-g we
wouldn’t belie-ve it.” He also
stated that “never have so few
spent so much to tell us -so
little.”

“In the next decade govem-
ment spending will double, and
at the end of the 70’s it will dou-

. ble again,” Reagan said. “This

means that the government will
be handling more money, but it
does not mean more prosperity
for the people,” he emphasized.

Reagan discussed the effects
of inﬂation on the national eco-
nomy. “The poor are always hit
hardest :by inﬂation,” he said.
“This is followed by cracking
of the moral -structure. Demo-
cracy is not served by inflation.
It causes the credibility -gap to
become a morality gap,” he
stressed.

Reagan spoke of his govern-
ment improvements in Califor-
nia, citing a phone bill reduc-
tion, freeze -on out-of-state trav-
el, and a Blue Ribbon commit-
tee which recruited government
employees from a variety of oc-
cupations as examples of Re-
publ-ican successes.

demonstrators in California,” he
said. “I saw a. group of them
with a sign that read ‘Make
Love—Not War,’ and they did-
n’t look capable of doing either,”
he added.

Reagan pointed out that new
welfare programs never replace
the old ones. “They’re just lay-
ered -over,” -he -said, “making a
temporary remedy for a tempo-
rary sickness become a perma-
nent way of life.

“The welfare programs of to-
day are ten times larger than
-those during the depression,” he
stated. “The government is per-
petuasting degradation. Maybe if
we stop tryin-g to be -our broth-
er’s keeper and become our
broth-er's”b-rother instead, we'll
ﬁnd out he can keep himself,”
Reagan declared.

He went on to say that “there
is a wind of change blowing over
the land. People want the free-
dom that is theirs by Divine
right, not by government whim.
The rules for a nation are the
same as those for individuals,”
Reagan stressed.

He called for uniﬁcation be-
yond party, racial, and geo-
grapvical divisions. “Students of
today want a cause to believe
in,” Reagan said. “They have
criticism of the leadership at the
head of the nati-on, and of those
who would buy the people's vote
with the people's money,” he
clariﬁed.

Rea-gan concluded by stating
that “there is no ﬁner heritage
we can leave to -our sons and
daughters than to assume the
responsibility t-o restore the
American dream.”

After his public address at
the luncheon Reagon conducted
a press conference. He announc-
ed that he most deﬁnitely is not
a presidential candidate, but
that he will “Work unhesitating-
ly for the Republican nominee.”

According to Reagan, the Re-

tain access -to the necessary in-

feat.”

  

  For Victory In College Bowl

early on a query about a ship
and a landing place, and came
up with the correct reply of
“Noah's Ark.” With momentum
-established, it appeared that the
Pitt team could do no wrong.

For example, a critical music-
al bonus question required ei-
ther name of the piece or the
composer, but not both. Captain
George Gray answered, “The
Rites of Spring,” by Rimsky-
Korsakoff instead of naming
Igor Stravinsky as the author.
But since Gray had named the
title ﬁrst.

Gray had carried the team vir-
tually by himself during the ﬁrst
half, and he deftly handled the
second half bonus questions.

Tom Graves contributed a clutch ’

response by correctly indicating
“13” as the number of black and
white piano keys that Sviatisov
Richter could cover with one
hand.

On one bonus, the team knew
that Ahab had no leg, that Poly-
phemus was missing an eye and
Van -Gogh an ear, but, the agon-
izing shout of one television
cnooters, notwrith-standing, no one

knew that a character in King

Lear had no toes.

Rumor now has it that Dr.
Kenneth Cummins of the B10-
logy Department went into a

_ mild case of shock when both

teams missed a question on the
work of Drs. Watson and Crick.
As all Bio 80 alumni know, Wat-
son and Crick did research on
the DNA molecule.

Perhaps the biggest surprise
of all came when Brourman, no
artist him-self, somehow knew
that Alfred Durer painted wood-
cuts in the late 16th century.

Oh yes, the University re-
ceived matching $1,500 scholar-
ship grants from the General
Electric Co. and Seventeen mag
azine for yesterday's victory.

Student Organization Claim

 

Local Police Campus Danger

WASHINGTON (CPS) — An-
other liberal student organiza-
tion has warned college admin-
istrators that the involvement
of local police on campuses “con-
stitutes -a dangerous precedent
which could ul-timately threaten
the traditional autonomy of the
academic community.”

The new warning came in a
resolution adopted by the Na-
rtional Board «of Campus Ameri-
cans for Democratic Action
(CADA). The National Student
Association recently issued a
similar warn-ing.

The CADA
“local police are seldom noted
for their restraint,” and it is
impossible for liberals “to stand
idly by and watch our fellow
students subjected to brutal
treatment.”

But «the CADA Board, com-
posed of 16 elected student rep
resentatives, did not side corn-
rpletely with the demonstrators.

is being dealt a serious blow by
the demonstrators. “The best
possible university policy is that
of allowing equal access to all,”
it said.

The resolution also said that
antiwar sentiments should be
channeled into political activity,
“and above all into the attempt
to elect to the White House in
1968 a candidate pledged to a
progressive domestic policy and
to peace in Vietnam as part of
a liberal foreign policy.”

CADA also adopted a resolu-
tion highly critical of the John-
son Administration and applaud-
ing the recent statement of Sen.
Eugene McCarthy declaring his
willingness to enter primary
contests. But the resolution did
not go so far as to endorse Mc-
Carthy. “We call on other can-

Editorial

Ken Schueler -—

Student Government’s (SG) lackadaisical performance this past year
has made students seriously question the validity of its entire existence.
One candidate is even running on a platform to abolish SG. We cannot
deny that SG  been a most ineffective vehicle during this last admin-
istration, however, we urge students not to blame the failures of some
on others who were not part of the current regime.

After viewing the three presidential contenders and their running
mates on many occasions, both in the heat of debate and the calmness of
-an informal talk, we have reached several conclusions. First of all, while
we have witnessed Armand Belly’s debating skill and have listened to the
sketchy arguments he presents for his case to abolish SG, we contend
that he falls far short of providing a constructive alternative. Belly’s prop-
osition destroys an entire structure without really providing the means
for effectively representing the students’ rights. Also, does it not seem
strange that Belly no-w wishe-s to destroy this very SG structure that he
campaigned for last year as a senatorial candidate?

He constantly stresses education as the most vital issue. However,
he has no provision for an organization to ﬁght for a ten per cent across
the board discount for students in the Book Center; to eliminate the con-
ﬂict o-f interest between the Bo-ok Center and John Langstaff’s Your Cam-
_pus Store; to rally for a badly needed Student Union; or even achieve
his educational goals. Belly contends that a new Student Union is not im-
p-ortant; we strongly dissent. One can concentrate on issues such as edu-
cation, but it is equally important to ﬁght for students’ needs and beneﬁts.
If Belly achieves his goal, there will be no effective vehicle to rally for any
cause. A votefor Belly is to vote against the best interests of the student
body.

The Case For Belly

     

To Renew SG

Belly’s fellow contender, George Doperak, has shown a surprising
lack of awareness for one who -has been involved in SG and other organ-
izations. Doperak’s slips of the tongue have been far too frequent. More
important, Doperak’s inability to wage a strong campaign has been great-
ly hindered by his running mate, Rich Fugo, whose glowing generalities
fail to grasp the essentials involved in this campaign.

Newness and a fresh approach to SC is no reason to be condemned;
it is often a valuable asset. A case in point is Ken Schueler, who, while
active in other organizations, is new to SG. His executive experience in
running his fraternity, however, plus his work on other activities such
as Men’s Dorm Council, Intrafraternity Council, and Secondary Schools
Committee, give him a background to effectively lead SG. His running
mate, Frank Tutino, is an SG senator who also heads Engineering Cabi-
net. He is far and away the most qualiﬁed of the vice-presidential aspir-
ants. Together, he and Schueler make for a strong ticket.

Schueler has far more than paper qualiﬁcations, however. He is a
man of convictions whose past actions show him to be guided by one main
force——integrity. When he takes on a job, as he did in building his fra-
ternity, he tackles it with his all. This is what he has vowed to do with SG,
and judging by his past performance, we cannot help but believe him.

.Ken Schueler will prove to the student body that strong leadership
from the SG president will make the difference. And so we urge the stu-
dents—before you vote to destroy SG, give Ken Schueler the oppor-
tunitu to prove to you that there IS something worth saving. After
careful scrutiny, we believe he deserves that chance. I

Letters to the Editor

  
  

A Workable Alternative

by Hobart Harris

I am damn angry. I am sick
and tired of the poke that we
sometimes call Student Govern-

, menrt (SC). I am tired of being

told that this year the apathy
problem will be solved, this year
the parking problem will be
solved, -this year the book store
will be rev-amped. Bull.

For four years I have sat
around while senatorial and
presidential candidates have told
me how much they care about
me, how much they are willing
«to work for m-e, and how little
they resemble the bunch that
said -the same thing last year.
Frankly; my powers of belief
have been stretched beyond the
breaking point and I am eager

to ﬁnd an alternative, .21 person

with the honesty -to stand up

and tell me the truth. Armand

Belly has done that in his call
for the abolition of SG. For once
there is a responsible, intelli-
gent, skilled "person running for
SG president who can do what
he is setting out to do, and re-
-make this campus into some-
thing we can be proud of.

I say this because I have

known Armand for four years,
and I have seen him in action.
There is not a more competent

person on this campus. He is a’

political ta-ctician of almost un-
believeable ability. To the best
of my knowledge, he has never
lost a political contest in this

University. Armand gets what

he wa-nts, and Armand wants to
{improve this University by abol-
ishing «an organization that does
not function, and replace it with.
organizations than can.

Much has been said about Ar-
mva.nd’s basic .point that SG can
never be effective the way it is
now constituted. I think that
facts have supported this state-
ment. The last three years cer-
tainly support this statement.
VVhen was the last time that
S_G did something for you?

Candidates Schueler and Dop-
era.k (the George Romney of
the campaign) will claim that
S-G has been ineffectual recent-
ly because of weak leaderslhip.
=Bu:t SG’s current leaders seem
no more anemic than most of
their predecessors. Nor do
Schueler and Doperak. These
two carboncopy candidates have
given no indication that they
will be any more effective or
‘able than any other previous of-
ﬂce holders. Of «the three candi-
dates, only Armand has real
ability.

The reason is that this cam-
pus, because of the very make-
up of diverse student types, is
just not composed in such a way
as to encourage unity. And,
without unity( SG «is a ﬂarce.
There is the commuter, the dorm
student, the frat man, the en-
gineer. Each of us has differ-
ent interests, different activities,
different friends. We're accused

of apathy when the real villain
is diversity, and diversity is here
to stay.

Rather than try to interest
each of us in everyone else’s
problems, Armand is giving us
the chance to concentrate on our
own. This might be selﬁsh, but
it is not really. I honestly think
that each of us is his own judge
of his own needs and I think
that it is an insult to be told
that we need 21. SG to tell what
they are. We will join the or-
ganizations which are set up
speciﬁcally to fulﬁll these needs.
And I think that Armand is giv-
ing us that chance, by taking
power out of the hands of the
student establishment and giv-
ing it-to the students. By abol-
ishing SG, people will give them-
selves, really give themselves to
the more specialized organiza-
tions that have an effect on
their lives. Rather than having
an organization that represents
everybody and satisfies none of
us, why not have a whole group
of organizations as Armand
wants, each designed to involve
us personally? .

Instead of feeling that we
have no say in ouraffairs——«and
most {of us feel that way, we
will have ‘a chance to be impor-
tant, to be involved, to ﬁght for
what we want to see. It's no se-
vcret that if Doperak or Schueler
are elected, the act of pulling
the handle of the voting ma-
chine will be the last effective
political act that any of us will
accomplish until elections next
year.

Doperak and Schueler argue
that wi-thout SG there will be
no “coordination” within Stu-
-dent Activities. But Armand
states that what is really need-
ed is effectiveness. So far, SG
has been able to coordinate me-
diocrity, but little else. Had
enough? i

cagers went virtually undefeat-
ed, .amassing a 14 and 3 record.
This year, however, as they
graduated to the varsity ranks
we notice no such Wizardry.‘ At
the recent Penn State game
everyone noticed the absence of

last year’s freshman high scorer,

from the starting li-ne up. 'I\avo
nights ago he only saw 11 min-
utes against WVU. This surely
is no way to treat a man who in
the first few games was also
varsity high ‘scorer.

One wonders why a coach
would leave on his bench this
man who's outside shot is re-
spected, especially when we are
not tall enough to shoot inside.
Why doe.s a coach take such a
valuable man on the traveling
squad if he does not intend to
use him? If nothing else it is
a waste of athletic funds.

On a larger scale, one ques--

tions the reasons for the ﬁailure
of this year’s varsitywhich has
combined with a-n impressive

freshman team of last year. It .

is not that we don't have a 6’10”
center, for we defeated a much
taller Temple sqwad. It is not
that we don't recruit, two sophs
came from state championship
teams.

Conceivably the cause could
be an ill rapor between coach
and team. If a coach c-annot
command the respect of an ath-
lete should the athlete be penal-
ized? Must Pitt's record become
two and 20 before coach Tim-
mons realizes that something is
wrong somewhere? One certain-
ly hopes that at the next basket-

Editor, The Pitt News:

Too bad for all you guys with
long hair, or beards, or God for-
bid both. You cannot take coach
Perry's paddle ball course. I
know; I tried. I am one of those
unfortunates with a beard and
semi-long, clean, hair who at-
tempted to register. Last week
I made that trip up to Trees
Hall and got as far as «signing
my name before that pillar of
the Athletic Department, coach
IPerry, explained the conse-
quences of my appearance. It
was quite obviou-s that my beard
and his personality were incom-
patible. ,

I had heard ‘previously of his
-fanatic dislike of excess -hair
and was not too surprised by
what he had to say. Nnaively I
asked whether my appearance
would -inﬂuence my grade and
in a ﬁrm, deep, ‘voice he re-
plied, “What grade?” He would
tolerate my presence in his class,
but I would not receive «a grade
unless I shaved and cut my hair.
In fact, he “suggested” that I
do not take the class.

I t-hen proceeded to tear up
my registration card and gave
it back to. him. As I left I could
just imagine this -stalwart of
the University thinking that he
had single handedly stemmed
the tide of the “Hippie take
over." Good work Saint Perry!

Iron Mountain Report Conclusion

by RICHARD ANTHONY

Report from Iron Mountain on
the -possibility and desirability of
peace: forward by Leonard C.
Lewin.

The Report from Iron Moun-
tain, as explained i-n the pre-
face, is a -document prepared by
a group of eminent scholars and
experts during a three-year per-
iod, from 1963 to 1966, at the
request of «certain high govern-
ment offi-cials.

One member of th-e group,
’MLl‘_l1Qn1_,_L§VY’ln describes as, a
“professor at a large university
in the Middle West,” dissented
from the «rna-j-orlty opinion that
the report should not be publish-
ed, and brought it to Lewi-"n for
help in getting it out.

The professor, according to
Lewlin, agreed to be interviewed
for pub-lication about the back-
ground of the Report. The in-
terview appears as a preface to
the Report proper. In it the pro-
fessor explains -tlhlat the group
held its ﬁrst and last meetings
in an underground vault at Iron
Mountain in upstate New York
(the vault -being the emergency
headquarters for various large
corporations, to be used in the
c-ase of nuclear attack). Other
meetings were held in hotels
and private residences around
the country, at the rate of about
one a month.

The Report's major conclusion
is that war, far from being just
one component of United States
foreign policy, is in fact the 
is for the country's social Struc-
ture. It argues, therefore, that
the coming of a. genuine peace-
the absence of all war and war-
makin’g potential — would re-
quire fundamental changes in
the. structure of the US.

A.mon\g the Report’ S other
ﬁndings are the following:

‘Econ-omicaly, war,
threat of war, generate huge
spending programs outside the
market system, which act as
“ﬂywheels” to keep the economy
as a whole from slowing down.

Politically, war helps a gov-
ernment maintain its identity as
protector of the people, which
is a. major factor in holding
their loyalty. In a world where
no war threat existed, national
governments would be hard put
to prove themselves worthy of
support.

Sociologically, the war system
has -several basic functions. It
provides a haven for the “fas-
cist” element that forms a part

    

-or the

of ‘any y ,,,,my,,,a;v ,p9pg1a,t1g’n;,,  this way is a social science hab-

acts a.s a welfare system for
those who would be unemploy-
able outside the mililta-ry; by
means of the -draft, it controls
the potentially dissident young;
and finally, it provides the basis
for social -cohesion by proving a
society’s willingness to offer up
the lives of some for the protec-
tion of all.

In View of these and other
functsi-ons of the war system, the
Report maintains, «any transition
to peace will require substitute
«functions. It warns ‘that an ear-
ly -movement toward world peace
could bring on a disastrous so-
cial upheaval within the US.

Is the Report authentic? Most
of the reviewers I've run across
have decided not, that it’s in
reality a very clever piece of
satire by Lewin (a writer, and
frequent contributor to Mono-
cle, a satirical magazine pub-

ljshed from time to time in New

York).

As far as I'm concerned, the
question of the Report’s authen-
ticity is one each reader -ought
to decide for -himself. Looking
for cl-ues in the muddy currents
of the book’s socially-scientiﬁc
non-style adds interest to the
reading. I personally believe it's
a fake for a variety of reasons
that I won't go into, except to
say that the outrageousness of
the book’s conclusions isn’t one
of them. Most of the conclu-
sions, in fact, struck me as being
fairly prosaic.

In any event, the signiﬁcance

“of the Report does not depend

on its authenticity——regardless
of who wrote it, it is a study
that raises a lot of interesting
question-s about the prospects
for world peace.

The basic approach of the au-
thor(s) of the Report is to look
upon nations as systems, rather
than as aggregations of people.
In the Report, therefore, nation-
al events are seen as the func-
tioning of the system, not as the
products of a series of decisions
by individuals. In explaining
some of the reasons why "W
tions wage war, for example, the
Report says that war “serves
the same purpose for a society
as do the holiday, the celebra-
tion, and the orgy for the indi-
vidual—-the release and distri-
bution of undiﬂ’erentia.ted ten-
sions.” War also Pl’0Vid95 1°’
the “dissipation of general bore-
dom." _

Viewing nations as systems In

  

it that I don’t pahticularly care
for, because it tends to -obscure
the part that individuals can
play in affecting what nations
do. There are some advantages
to taking the Report’s perspec-
tive, however. Of these, one of
the most important is that the
individual realizes‘ he is really
a part of the same system that
has produced, say, -the Vietnam
war.

(I should add that if the Re
port is a fake, then there’s no
doubt the author wanted the
reader to reach precisely this
realization. The evidence is clear
enough, so I won’t bother to cite
it here.)

Another advantage of taking
the “system” viewpoint is that
it tends to make the reader
think in terms of history, which
is an unfamiliar mode of
.thought for most Americans.
The US doesn’t have too much
of a past, and such of it as there
is has been largely reduced to
legend (vide the -deiﬁcation of
JFK, for a recent example), so
that few interpret what this na-

tion does in terms of what we

and other nations have done in
the past. Our approach is al-
ways new, our circumstances in-
variably unique.

If one takes an «historical view,

- War Is Basis of US. Social Structure

though, then much of what the
Report has to say seems like
painful truisms. After all, as
the Report suggests, states have
traditionally been deﬁned by the
effectiveness of their warmak-
ing powers. Those -that couldn’t
keep up their defenses -lost out,
while those that were strong
grew at the expense of their
weaker foes. This is an over-
s-implication, of course, but no-
m~a:tter—<the point is that mili-
tary strength was never some-
thing that existed independent

' of a state's internal strengths

and weaknesses. A high degree
of loyalty and willingness to
sacrifie at home has been a pre-
condition for waging war since
warfare began.

On another level, ist’-s obvious
‘t;h~a:t conﬂict has been one of the
most important constants of hu-
man existence from the start.

Not to lalbor the «point, it's 
perfectly clear that modern war-
fare is outgrowth of more prim-
itive forms of Fconﬂict. And
,while modern warfare is in al-
most every' sense more barbaric
than, say, a ﬁght between two
Iron Age men, it also provides
an organized outlet for the vio-
lent inclinations of men.

Playhouse’s ‘Rashomon’
Misfires, Becomes Farce

The Pittsburgh [Pl-ayh~ou~.s-e pro-
dUlCt‘i‘OlI1 of Rashomon, originally
based on stories by Ryunosuke
Akutagawa, and written by Eay
and Michael Kanin, should have
been retitled “As the World
Turns, Ah S-0.”

Intended to be a drama of
life's incongruiities, Rashomon
-has been turned into a farce by
the Playhouse. The six major
charaotens perform upon a re-

, volving stage and ideology. The

major theme, the changing role
of “face,” VVIBJS inconsistenrt, the
attempt as psychic perception
feeble. The plot focused upon
the contradictory stories of a
murder. Each of the th—ree_char-
acters told his own version as a
“looking glass self.”

The invert-ed triangle——wife,
husband, and bandit —'—w-as reit-
erated by the woodcutter and
priest to a rogue, the wigmaker.
The triolog-y of wood-cutter,
priest, and wigmaker function-

-ed as a -sliighrtly comic Greek

chorus.

The one bright spot of the
production was the wigmaker
played with great humor by
William Hansen. Mr. Hansen
fortunately had the choicest dia-
ologue, and played with a rough
tongue in cheek quality that
suited his role admirably. Steph-
en Pearlman as the bandit gave
a paultry imitation of Clark
Kent with a Zorba accent. The
priest and assistant stage man-
ager Milton Earl Forest should
have remained off stage. Per-
haps William Uappas, director,
should have spent more time in
the library and less in the cor-
ner candy store.

The first three acts were some-
what uniﬁed in tone, and ‘advan-
agely performed. The ﬁnal act
was totally inconzgruious to the
others, and burlesqued out of
p.-roposntion. Evidently the Bol-
.shoi’s standards are not what
they once were. Is Nureyev a
Samuri. Are “George and Mar-
tha ” afraid of the paper drag-
on? Should child actors be paint-

ed on the set?

Technically, -the production
was well d-one. The set construc-
tion and light design was han-
dled with subtly and imagina-
tion. Ten points for William
Linrstrom, technical director. Un-
fortunately the bamboo revolv-
inrg forest could not hide the
trees!
