Faculty Callfor Voice inCuts

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg outlined
next year’s FAS budget and pre-
sided over passage ofa resolution by
the faculty calling for “mechanisms

for coping with our new budgetary

circumstances” at a special FAS
meeting April I4.

Rosenberg said FAS planned
reductions stand at $907 thousand,
representing a loss of 27 TA/TF’s,
I8 full—time.and 7 part-time faculty
positions, 7 non-faculty as well as ,
seven or eight advisers. g i

The anouncement of the lo_ss of

advising positions was a revision of A

the earlier announcements that IS of
35 advising positions would be lost.

The FAS resolution, authored by
history professor Samuel Hays,
which passed 38-38, stated that
“existing units cannot be retrenched
further without endangering their
viability...we have reached our lim-
its on that score and can, if it con-
tinues, readily visualize the FAS as a
collection of strangled parts.
Second, whittling dollars here and!
there is no longer sufficient.”

The resolution also called for “a
new departure in decision—making.
lt is no longer satisfactory that the
admiiiistration ‘make decisions by
itself...That approach- has led and
will continue to lead to an escalating.
climate of frustration, cynicism and-.
distrust.” ’

The resolution called on “the
Dean and elected faculty representa-

tives in FAS*to~set in motion action a

to establish mechanisms for coping
with our new budgetary circumstan-
ces...generate more participation
and wider debat , and have astheir
goal the c—reation of a higher degree
of shared views as to what a

rletrenched FAS faculty and pro-

gram should be.” ‘ . _

“I didn’t have an overwhelnfing
feeling that'this is what the faculty
wanted," said Rosenberg. “They,

i wanted to express some concern. It

was the best resolution available to
them." ' ~- ‘
Thefaeulty wanted some assuran-
ces theecuts really are necessary.
They’ felt better when they left the
meeting that they understood the
process. I would say there's some
unease-» and concern rather than
disgruntlement." , ,
Rosenberg said he discusses
budgetary matters with the FAS
Council-appointed FAS budgetary
committee, which hesaid until this
year has been unable to findgan
FASC member willing to serve on
the; board._ He described ‘relations

them and react to suggestion.”
“The budgetary committee has
given the definite opinion that a
proposal for budget reductions can-
not be made by a democratic pro-
ccss,” Rosenberg said. “It must be
made by the Dean, informed by
faculty opinionvand by a good set of
facts.” Rosenberg added this also
applies to initiatives for reductions.
Rosenberg also said he believed
the decision-making process is not a
bad system. “Maybe there should be
_more members," he said. “Maybe we
should meet more often. Maybe we
should publish more information in
the (FAS) Gazette. I’m willing to
sharea good deal of imformation.”
‘The way the budget process is set
up someone has to make‘ decisions
and I think ultimately the reaction of
the university community will
depend on the degree of confidence
of the integrity of people making
decisions. l think there should be
disclosure and explanation of ratio-
nale. But ultimately some small
number of people will have to make"
the decisions.” ‘ ' '
Roseberg said he explained at the‘

An
Objectionable
Choice

Pitt’s l59th Commencement marked a turning point
in the lives of nearly 2000 Pitt graduates. For this
important occasion, it is the responsibility of the uni-
versity to present to the graduates a speaker who
represents moral and intellectual leadership. With the
selection of UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, the
university has failed to fulfill its obligation.

There are problems with boththe commencement
speaker selection process and the speaker herself. Pitt
Chancellor Wesley Posvar has defended the selection
process, saying Kirkpatrick was invited last January
after her unanimous appointment as UN Ambassador,
and this decision was made according to established
procedures. Posvar also said the decision was reviewed
-by faculty members of her discipline, political science,
and discussed with various other faculty.

Posvar‘s justification for the Kirkpatrick selection
process is incomplete. In choosing a speaker as blat-
antly controversial as Kirkpatrick, the established
procedures proved inadequate, as Posvar should have
easily recognized. Faculty and‘ students who objected
to the choice of a Commencement speaker believed,
quite justifiably, that they should have had more of a
say in determining the person the university would
endorse as a representative of its goals and ideals. To
implythat those who objected to Kirkpatrick were

‘ merely fermenting a cause completely sidesteps. the
issue of what Kirkpatrick stands_for.
Kirkpatrick has held meetings with South African
Military intelligence Officials, has characterized four
American nuns who were killed in El Salvador as
“political activists,” and is a representative of Presi-
dent Reagan’s hawkish foreign policy.

Although the UN Ambassador is free to hold any’
political or moral views she chooses, her choice as
Commencement speaker is unacceptable.

 

Pitt, like any other university, must be an advocate ‘ ‘

_l of free discourse. But to select Kirkpatrick as a com-
 meiicement speaker constitutes an',endo.'r.$,e,ment of her j ,

Confusing News and Entertainment

By MARY KANE

Pm News Editor

So Prince Charles is marrying
Lady Diana. 1 saw in the paper the
other day a picture of the prince tak-
ing a royal fall off his trusty horse. l
would have been amused by the pic-

'ture, had it not been on the front

page of the newspaper.

Its hard to understand the British
obsession with the royal family, and
even harder to comprehend why
Americans _ bother to show the
slightest inerest. It might be a plea-
sant diversion to see their pictures in
junk food magazines like People or
Us, but journalistically. they should
stick to the back pages where they
belong.

Of course, sophisticated Ameri-
cans like us show little interest in
anything but the hardest of news:
economic hardships, the El Salva-
dor situation, Poland. lt didn’t mat-
‘ter one« bit to us that Ronald
Reagan‘s daughter Patti once lived
with a rock singer, or that Billy Car-
ter grabbed national headlines asa
beer-guzzling good ole boy, orthat a
convicted congressman‘s wife
became a pin-up girl. We still
watched Patti sing on T.V. specials,
drank Billy Beer, and, well, some of
us took a peek at Rita Jenrette.

The line of demarcation’
between news andientertainment
becomes twisted/when the royal
family competes with Suzanne

Sommers for the cover of 7'i?ne, or at
’ front-page picture of El Salvador
-protestors

gets bumped for the
prince and his horse. ln addition to
the contributions offered by the
print media, the confusion over
what’s news and what’s entertain-
ment becomes re-enforced by the
specials and “news”magazines we
run into on our way to changing the
channels on our T.V. sets.

For example: _
KDKA‘s Evening Magazine-This
may be a magazine, but it's definitely
not-news. And if/you're a guy, don’t
bother watching it unless you’re
interested in face makeovers, jazzer-
cise, or where to ‘buy designer
clot_hes. Last week's special was on
_ (yawn) where and how to exercise in

myself, thank you.

it-how can you take this program

Geraldo Rivera?‘ (Remember: his
maiden name was Jerrv Rivers)

60 minutes-this is the source of all .

“And if Dan Rtnlier were in
such mortal danger in
Afghanistan, what about
the CBS cameramen who
were ﬁlming the whole
thing?” i -S
the clone news" magazines we now
.endure.  Sixty minutes; though,
presents a serious attempt to tell the

news. Sometimes. You might have ,

thought that ‘Joe Paterno was next
to (jod an_d his players next to gra-
duating as physics majors if you saw
the 60 Minutes profile on him a
while back. (Excuse the bias.) Any-
way, if 60 Minutes were just a teensy
bit more earnest, they wouldn’t keep
picking expose targets comparable

to sitting ducks.‘ Everybody knows V

that if you go to a bible school deep
in Texas you‘ll find a preacher who
doesn’t believe in sparing the rod
and spoilingthe child. And if Dan
Rather was in such mortal danger in
Afganistan, what about the CBS
cameramen who were filming the
whole thing? Tick, tick, tick, tick...

There is an escape from all this.
What you have to do, though, is stay
up a few extra hours..When ABC
began to present late night reports
on the hostage crisis, they did some-
thing that is alien to most networks:
they recognized a» quality program
and continued to air it. Nightline
with Ted Koppel is definitely a few
steps ahead of the rest of the T.V.
news fare,so staying up a little longer
is worth it. Of course, don’t stay up
too long, because you'll come upon
the Tomorrow show with Tom

Snyder and you probably don’t want

to do that.

A final note-don‘t be too optimis-
tic about the future of late night

quality news programs. Already the.

rival networks are brewiiig up their
_ own versions of Nightline, so it
won‘t be long before you can get a
makeover, learn jazzercise and buy
designer jeans on late night TV, to'o.

The Inside Story

 The‘

  Ceremony

 

7 Slowly, yet purposefully, the Pitt
graduating class of l98l blanketed
the Civic Arena floor, descending
upon the nearly 2,000 seats like
black dye in a molecular transporta-
tion experiment, their optimism
subdued for the moment. i

The Pittsburgh Youth Symphony
Orchestra, led by Music Director
Michael Lankester set the musical
tone to the processional as the
graduates—»everything from Ph.D
to ‘Bachelor of Arts——— took their
seats with rehearsed efficiency, des-
pite the fact that part of the cerem-
ony was actually unrehearsed.

The differences in the robes of the
faculty and the students, the differ-
ent degree recipients, the class mar-
shals and representatives, were
striking. So different, in fact, that if
one was unaware of the traditions of
each academic robe, then it might be
assumed that everyone just couldn’t
agree on what to wear.

“The kindest thing I could
do is not to speak at all, but
[promised to make a com-
mencement speech and I
intend to keep mypr0mise”

Bachelor degree recipients, with
white tassels on_their mortar boards
for arts and yellow for science, were»
easily distinguished from the'docto-
rate degree recipients” who had
gowns with velvet ‘faced down the
front and three bars of velvet across
the sleeves in the color correspond’-
ing to the discipline the degree
represents. ‘ ~

, And the faculty,‘ seated off the
floor on both sides, were a collection

of colors and robes, appearing like a ,
_ nest of distinguished birds in their

heralded plumage. For most of the
* faculty this commencement wasjust
one out of many in their careers, but

for the new'graduates on the floor it»

would probably remain as the only
one in their lifetime until ‘their child-
Fen come of age. .

For those students who had
remained steadfast in their ambition
to- graduate someday from Pitt,
today was that someday. And if the
expectations of their educations
were slightly diminished, the expec-
tations of this l59th annual com-
mencement were heightened by

~ most accounts. This commencement

mencement ceremony.

mater and benediction, by the Reve-
rend Nathan E. Williams. No, those
graduation parties , and Sunday
dinners would have to wait, this gra-
duation was going to finish as
planned. 0

After Chancellor Posvar asked
the graduates‘ families to rise and‘

congratulate themselves for above «-
_all, sticking through it all, Ambassa-

dor Kirkpatrick was introduced by
Roger Ahlbrandt, chairman of Pitt’s
board of trustees.

“The kindest thing I could do is
not speak at all, but l promised to
make a commencement speech and l
intend to keep my promise,” Kirkpa-
trick said, receiving a- scattered

applause which drowned out the,‘

ensuingjeers and boos preceding her
introduction. \

lron-willed and steady, she deli-
vered her speech despite a few times
when shouts of “racist" and “what
about South Africa” were heard.
Chancellor Posvar saidalater that she

i told him she was a—bit “unsettled” by

the comments, butshe continued her
speech to the end.

Approximately'35 graduates and
one faculty member stood and
turned their backs toward Kirkpa-
trick, in silent, yet deliberate protest.

nuns killed in El Salvador as politi-
cal activists, Kirkpatrick attributed
her commentsaboutthenunsto“the'
whole process of totalization and
politization" which takes place in
societies like-El Salvador.

“lnsuch a society, under such cir-
cumstances, anyone who is per-

.ceived as having views about the
conflicts gets perceived as an acti-
vist,” Kirkpatrick said.

She said the problem in El Salva-
dor is multi-causual and multi-
factored, terming the tradition of
governments there as weak and lack-
ing in a history of popular legiti-

' macy. The fact that the governments

are consistently ‘overthrown justifies
the claim, she said.

“Governments that get over-
thrown are weak governments and
they've been too weak to maintain
order in the society, much less to
serve_as a channel for reform or
improvement.” 0 a '

Kirkpatrick also disputed criti-
cism comparing her meeting. with
the South -African officials and
Andrew Young’s meeting with the
Palestine Liberation Organization
which resulted in Young’s
resignation. ‘ -

The two meetings were dissimiliar
because South Africa is a country
‘with a governmenttwith whom the
United States has diplomatic rela-
tions whereas the PLO is not a
government and “we take the view
that we should not have any sort of
official relations with them.” she
said. a .

further, she said the Young resigna-

The
Protest

 

Jeanne Kirkpatrick faced hecklers
and the turned backs of over 40
black students’ as she delivered Pitt’s.
commencement address at the Civic
Arena on Sunday, April 26.

Outside the arena, a group, esti-
mated ' by police at over 200,
marched in a circle and chanted slo-
gans in protest of her visit.

Kirkpatrick has been a controver-
sial figure since she was appointed.
U.S. ambassador to the United.
Nations by Ronald Reagan, in Janu-
_ary. Criticism of the selection Bf
Kirkpatrick as commencement
speaker first surfaced at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in an open letter
by Robert Morgart in the April 23
University Times. '

In the letter, Morgart accused
Kirkpatrick of making “repeated
statements which support the terror-

Vism conducted by military regimes

against their own people.” He also
charged the university with selecting
a speaker whose political position is_
“inconsistent with the ideals and
goals of the university.”

Much of the controversy sur-
rounding Kirkpatrick centers
around two events, her meeting with

John Beverly, a member of Pitt’s
Hispanic Department, disagreed

with Kirkpatrick’s defense.

“Her comments about the nuns,
that they were political activists,
were made the same week and in the
same context as General Haig’s
comments that as»far as he was con-
cerned, the nuns were killed trying to

thing,” Posvar said. “They don’t
care what the issue is, and some of
those people don‘t care about South
Africa or Central America, they’re
just glad to have an opportunity to
ferment some controversy.”

Posvar maintains that the highest
priority in recruiting a commence-
ment speaker is thatithey be “people
‘who bring intellectual prestige to the
university." He said that getting peo-
ple to speak is not easy, and that

At a news conference prior to her appearance at the Civic

Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said that Kirkpa-
trick’s meetings with the South Afri-

‘cans were the same as former
ambassador Andrew Young.’s‘meet-
ings with Palestine Liberation
Organization leaders.

“It flies in the face of Young’s dis-
missal,“ Adams said. “A black does
this and gets drummed out of the
service."

John Zingaro, the Consumer can-
didate for Pittsburgh city council,
believes that Kirkpatrick represents
the more serious issue of principles
and priorities in the. new Reagan
administration.

“anyone who thinks that we can
select someone and that they’would
be delighted to come, is naive."

A box at the bottom ofthe letters
to the editor section of the same

issue of the ‘University Times that‘

carried Morgart’s letter explains the
selection process: “This” procedure
entailed discussion ofviarious poten-
tial candidates among Senate offic-
ers, Senate committee chairpersons
and faculty...Her name and creden-
tials were then reviewed by the polit-
ical science department chairperson
who contacted and received the
approval of relevant faculty in her

“He’ll value an entirenation, not-
for its human values, but simply be
cause” of its strategic worth," Zin-
garo said. “The issue right now is
protesting against the University of
Pittsburgh honoring the agent ofthe
President of the United States.”

Both Beverly and Morgart were
concerned with the process ofselect-
ing a commencement speaker.

“Why didn't the university com-
munity have more say in this cho-
ice," Beverly asked. “The choice was
made in early January. but it wasn't
announced publicly until a couple_of
weeks ago.“ _

Pitt‘s Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

According to "Michalick, the

several years. Her primary concern ~.

.is with the mechanics of the event.

If getting a bunch of students to

walk straight and sit in the right _i

consider the numbers involved: dig-

nitaries on the platform, 2,000 grad-
uates in attendencei, including over
400 doctoral candidates who must
step up to _the podium in order to
rece_ive their degrees,
audience of over 14,000 people.
According to Michalick, a -check
list for this sort of event would

and _ an-

include-_, hundreds, __ possibly even

thousands or individual details.
‘~Michalick’s first task is to notify
everyone involved in the‘ ceremony:
f graduates, faculty, faculty marshals,
school marshals, and school repre-
sentatives. Next, her office makes
available information on the availa-

'bility of capsiand gowns. Finally ‘i

there are the mechanics" of the

established by chart, by design.”

._ In addition"to the ceremony itself,
there are ‘security arrangements to
be made, programs to be printed,

and a dozen other details that are ‘

neccessary to commencement.

and her staff, managed to pullgthe
whole thing off.

‘‘I thought it" went --very well,”i77"'

hard we try our kids sometimes 

‘make mistakes, but there were very"

no formal courses or programs to

S to break it down into its individual

parts, a-nd to reassem_ble it backinto

the whole.”

_Pitt’s Chancellor Wesley Po_svar"
has said that ‘the most impoiftant.

aspect of the university" is its place  i
i a historical institution, and that “the_  

ritual is very important."

“This is a~,com'm'em'oration of the-

past, and it.is also something that is.

Coach Bobby Lewis

Notches 300th Win

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Three hundred victories for a collegiate
baseball coach is a milestone, but in the
northeast, where the spring weather is
unkind to baseball, those 300 victories carry

much more clout.

Pitt‘s Bobby Lewis is a coach with clout.
Senior Mike Luciow got Lewis No. 300
with the same high—class style that has cha-
ractierized his c0ach’s three decade stint at

Pitt.

Luciow hurled a no-hitter as Pitt blanked
Carnegie-Mellon ll-0 on April 22 to com-’
plete a doubleheader sweep and make the,

occasion a special one for Lewis.

“Luciow said he would make the win a

special and he made it a memorable one,"
Lewis said. “The team knew after the first

game that my 300th was coming, and-they

Although the Pitt Panther foot-
ball team concluded its spring drills
two weekends ago with an intras-
quad game at Pitt Stadium, thejury
is still debating on what kind offoot-
ball team the Panthers will ulti-
mately have in I981.

The game, in which the Blue
defeated the Gold 2l—0, behind two
touchdown passes by Dan Marino,
did little to answer many of the ques-
tions that face the Pitt coaching
staff, or to change the opinion of
head coach Jackie Sherrill, who said
after the game, “We still have a long
way to go.”

First the good news though.

Marino was impressive in his ﬁrst/

contact action of the spring after rec-

_ overing from knee surgery, showing
good mobility and speed as he
scrambled to elude the rush on sev-
eral occasions. He also passed with
his accustomed efﬁciency,- complet-
ing 13 of 26 passes for 230 yards,
including a 57-yard bomb to tight
end-candidate John Brown off of a
fake punt. '

“The knee felt very good and
didn’t bother me at all,” Marino
said. “lt’s about 90 to 95 percent
right now. l‘ll be ready by fall.”

Although all spring Sherrill has '

been saying he is displeased the most

‘V with the play at tailback, the game

may have also raised some concerns
about his two backup quarterbacks
Dan Daniels and D.J. Cava-
naugh, the brother of former Pitt
star Matt Cavanaugh.
Daniels, the only backup on the
team with regular-season expe-
rience, and Cavanaugh had great
difficulty moving the Gold squad
against the first team defense. Con-
sidering Marino has never played a
full, injury-free season in his ﬁrst
_ two years the Pantherteam, which is
A expected to rely on offense for the
first time in recent years, could be in

1 _.trouble if Marino goes down for any

"length of time.

_ Sherrill has been openly dis-
pleased with the competition for the
starting tailback spot. Last year’s
starter Joe McCall and backup
-Marc Bailey, a former high school
All-American, have not impressed
Sherrill during spring drills,
although Bailey did have a strong
game with 36 yards in six carries.
McCall rushed ll times for 13 yards.

“Bailey made some good moves in

the game, but no one has really
stepped forward and taken charge,”

Sherrill said. Sherrill restated that
he is looking for ways to get the ball

more frequently to Dwight Collins, A

Pitt's most explosive offensive
threat. Sherrill. is toying with the
idea of moving Collins from flanker
and in to the backﬁeld to get the
_, breakaway back he’s searching for.
“It all depends what happens this
fall,” Sherrill added, A
Offensive guard Emil Boures con-
tinued to practice at center through-
out the spring and played almost the

ting crown. Kline, batting at .432, is
"just one or two points behind
Parthemore, according to Pitt coach
Bobby Lewis.

Junior Darrell Gissendanner has
also beenon a tear lately, raising his
average from .324 to .367 since April
20. -

"With his speed, when he gets a sin-

gle, its like getting a double because

he’s'almost an automatic stealing ’

second base,” Lewis said.

Doug Steiner (.340), Marc Massa (
.350) and Mike Fitzpatrick (.307) fill
out the remainder of the Panthers’
potent offensive attack.

As for the pitching, Lewis has
only praise for his rotation, which
includes three six-game winners--
Larry Lamonde (6-l), Allen Lacho-
wicz (6-3) aand freshman Aaron
Krause (6-0). Those three pitchers
alone account for all but three of
Pitt's 2| wins.

”The starting pitching has been
excellent over break,” Lewis noted.
"We've had an awful lot of complete
games this year and_have used the
bullpen very seldom so far."

Some‘ major league scouts have
reportedly been observing several
members of the Pitt team this year,
according to Lewis. Kline, Lacho-
wicz, Chris Mahalik and Jim Pastin
all have the potential to go in the
major league's draft.

Lewis added that /the scouts are
particularly interested in Lacho-

wicz, who becomes eligible for the

major league draft this year, unde
collegiate "rules. _ ’

"Allen has an excellent fastball, a
good curve and a forkball. Hardly a

game passed when some scout‘

wasn’t at the game watching," Lewis
said. "They_’re particularly
impressed with his 7l strikeouts in
57 innings and his 1.57 earned run
average. -
The 20-win season is the first of
Lewis’ 27-year coaching career at
Pitt. Lewis is hoping to recieve a bid
to the NCAA Eastern regionals this
year, held May l6 in Connecticut.
"A eastern selection committee pi
cks the teams to participate in the
regional, and it's a very difficultjob
because there are certainly some

deserving teams who are bound to_
. beleft out,” Lewis said. ”But l'm still

hoping we recieve a bid. Since the
committee, Don Burkhirst, doesn't
see us play, all we can do is keep in
touch and’ send the committee
members our results and stats."

The Panthers close out their
regularly-scheduled season today_ at
Trees Field against Bucknell. Lewis
is trying to reschedule two early sea-
son- rainouts for this week, which
could extend Pitt’season into next

 W0men Gymitasts Cap

Successful Season

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Sports Editor

The Pitt Pantherettes women’s
gymnastics team capped its most
successful season ever under coach
Donna Sanft as it ﬁnished l2th at
the l98l Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women (AIAW)
National Championships in Utah
State. _

After sweeping through the regu-
lar season with an ll-l mark, with

the only loss coming in Pitt's final».

dual meet ofthe season against then
No. 2 Penn State, the Pantherettes
broke their team scoring record for
the third consecutivemeet as they
ﬁnished second to the Lady Lions at
this year’s Eastern Regiohals.

The second-place finish in the

East was the highest ﬁnish ever by a‘

Pantherette team. Three members of

the Pitt team-Holly Martino, Karen _
Karen\l\7lartin and Lisa Shirk earned '
_All-East honors, and Sanft was

voted Coach-of the Year by her fel-
low eastern coaches.

At Nationals, the Pantherettes
entered the meet seeded llth, and
rnissed finishing in that place by just
.5 hundredths of a point. '

Pitt freshman Lisa Shirk, a vete-
ran of high-level competitions
rebounded from a ﬁfth-place show-
ing at Easterns to ﬁnish second
nationally in the all-around with
36.6. UCLA’s Sharon Shapiro took
first at 37.2. i -

' “Lisa was very consistent
throughout the meet and had no
major breaks in her routines.”lt’s a
credit to her to place as high as she
did, since we competed in the after-
noon round where it‘s harder to_ get
the higher scores,” Sanft said.

Utah took top team honors at the
meet, followed by UCLA, Califor-
nia State, and Penn State.

A poor team performance on the
balance beam—Pitt‘s nemesis at this
year’s Easterns—probably pre-
vented the Pantherettes from ﬁnish-
ing even higher in the final

standings, based on their l35.65

SCOTC.

Five of the six Pantherettes who
competed on the beam fell off, and
the team finished l3th in the event.
Coupled with their consistently
strong scores in the other three

events-the floor exercises, the vault,

and the uneven bars-a good perfor-
mance on the beam might have
pushed the Pantherettes into the top
l0 in the standings.

“We finished eighth or ninth in
every other event, but the beam was
the event that brought us down. All
ofthe teams had trouble staying on."
said Sanft. '

Pitt had little trouble in the other

‘three events, and Sanft noted the

strong individual performances by
several Pantherettes. In addition to
Shirk, Pitt's other freshman stan-
dout, Karen Martin, finished l0th
on the unevens with a 9. I, and Holly

Martino did well on the floor and‘ L

vault, according to Sanft.
Bonnie.Tressler had a good rou-
tine on the bars also, before she was
knocked out when she missed her
dismount and suffered a concussion.

Sanft discounted the idea that the
Pitt team suffered from nervousness

during the meet, which was the first .

‘trip to Nationals for many of tlie

Pantherettes. Rather, Sanft cited the
commotion on the floor during the
meet as a distracting facter.

“There was a lot of action on the
“floor, as the television cameras kept

(repositioning and the rest of the

meet was in progress,” she said.
The Pantherettes’ fine showing ‘at
Nationals ended a season that was

marked by a number of precedents '

in Pitt women’s gymnastics. The
Pantherettes posted their highest
team average ever this season and its
highest finish ever at Easterns. And,
this year's trip to Utah State was
only the second time the Pitt team
qualified for Nationals. Both times,
Sanft was the ‘coach.

Several Pantherttes also rolled up
