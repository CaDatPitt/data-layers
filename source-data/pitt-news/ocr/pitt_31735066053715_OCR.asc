Melissa Blackwood
Staff Writer

After nearly two years of negotia-
tions, Pitt’s board of trustees approved a
retirement-incentive package that pays
eligible professors a cash bonus of up to
$125,000 to retire by May 1999.

The board also made it clear that this
is the last time the University will make
such an offer. _

The idea behind the plan is to save
University money by encouraging high-
er—paid faculty members to retire. Pitt
would then be free to replace them with
lower-paid faculty members or to leave
their positions unﬁlled.

The buyout is less generous, though,

than an" earlier version endorsed by the
faculty assembly.

That plan would have paid up to
$250,000 to eligible professors.

Some facultyemembers questioned
whether the smaller incentive will
encourage as many professors to retire
as Pitt thinks it will. 9 I

“I don’t think it’s going to work very
well. I don’t think it’s going to get the
kind of response needed for it to wor ,”
said James Holland, professor of psychi-
atry and chair of the task force that
endorsed the first proposal.

Holland said that despite the board’s
warning to the contrary, many professors
eligible to retire may wait to see whether
they will get a better deal in the future.

Beginning in 1982, Pitt has spon-
sored such retirement incentives as a
way to generate faculty turnover.

Because of this, many faculty mem-
bers began delaying their retirements
until the next incentive plan was offered:

However, the buyout passed by the
board last week included a resolution
not to support any more special retire-
ment plans in the future.

Under the plan, tenured faculty and

faculty librarians-must be at least 60

years old and have completed at least 12
years of service to be eligible for a cash
bonus.

If they agree to retire between July
1, 1998, and May 1, 1999, Pitt will pay
them 1.5 times their armual salary, in

addition to their regular retirement bene-
ﬁts.

The maximum cash payment will be
$125,000, though.

According to University figures,
358 faculty members are eligible for the
buyout. Administrators estimate that 30
percent of these persons will sign up for
the plan and retire, saving Pitt $12.1 mil-
lion in salary costs over the next seven
years. n

J. Wray Connolly, chairman of the
board of trustees, acknowledged that
many professors were hoping for a larg-
er incentive, but he cautioned them
against blaming administrators.

Rally for workers riles

hundreds of students

James Maude

Staff Writer

"The workers united will never be
defeated!" chanted workers, students
and faculty. They gathered for a rally in
support of the Service Employees
International Union Local 29 in front of
the Cathedral of Leaming on Thursday
at noon.

The union, which is still in negotia-
tions with University management over
maintenance workers‘ contracts, was
supported by approximately 200 people.
About 20 of them canied placards that
read "Pitt Inc.: Institution of Higher
Earning," "Students support mainte-
nance workers," "Raises for the chan-
cellor [no], Raises for Local 29 [yes],"
and "Pitt: Unfair-to workers, unfair to
students."

The rally was sponsored by the
International Socialist Organization
insteadoftheunion,becausetheunion
is not allowed to demonstrate during
contract negotiations.

Participants marched around the
Cathedral and encouraged onlookers to
join in. The chanting, led by ISO mem-
bers Barbara Kline and John Lacny,
included phrases such as "Up with the
workers, down with Pitt," "Union bust-
ing is disgusting," "Pitt says cut back,
we say ﬁght back," and "Raises for
workers, not for Mark [Chancellor
Nordenberg]!"

After the maintenance workers,

who participated during their lunch
breaks, went back to work, the remain-
ing marchers tried to get into the

Cathedral to present Nordenberg with a ,

petition signed by 800 people in suppo
of SEIU members. -

Pitt Police Chief Gary Moses ini-
tially wouldn’t allow anyone inside, but
after some discussion with the crowd,
he agreed to escort six students to
Nordenberg’s office on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
Assistant Chancellor Jerome Cochran
received them. .

Lacny said the University overre-
acted and was trying to ﬁnd technicali-
ties to prevent the students ﬁorn seeing
the chancellor. ’

"The fact that we're getting the mes-
sageout to the students scares them,"
said Lacny.

According to the students who met
with Cochran, Pitt management argued
that maintenance workers received a fair

wage compared to other universities and‘

that Pitt would not budge.

" [Cochran] used smokescreen-and-
minor tactics; he was trying to get
around the issue," said Lacny.

"We tried to get our ideas across to
him, saying that we're feeling the work-
ers are being treated unfairly," said grad-
uate student Joe Clefﬁe. "He basically
gave us rhetoric about how we're just
idealistic students, and that Pitt is being
realistic. They were presenting a typical
corporate/business argumen ."

Vandal strikes students’ pro-life
cemetery display on Union lawn

Brett Taylor
News Assistant

White-painted wooden crosses with pur-
ple bows laid scattered across the Wrlliarn
Pitt Union lawn Friday after a man pulled the
crosses up from the ground.

This "Cemetery for the Innocent" was
organized by Pitt Students for Life, a pro-life
organization on campus.

Pitt Police could not conﬁrm the man's
identity, but members of Students for Life
believe they can identify him.

According to Gina Reynolds, public-

relations director for Students for Life, she
and two other students were standing on the
edge of the patio of the union when the man
started pulling the crosses out of the ground.

She said they approached the man and
tried to stop him, but he began running
around vandalizing the display and broke
ﬁve crosses.

He then ran across Bigelow Boulevard

‘ to the Cathedral of Learning, where he sat

until Pitt Police came to him.
The police questioned him but said

Two Semester at Sea students were
detained by authorities and questioned in
Shanghai, China, after distributing a sur-
vey to collect information for a class
assignment. It is not known at this time
whether those detained were Pitt stu-
dents. .

According to Les McCabe, chief
administrative—affairs officer for
Semester at Sea, the students did not
have the survey OK'd by the proper
Chinese authorities.

He said that this sort of thing is com-
mon, especially in communist countries,
and that different cultures react differ-
ently to foreigners handing out ﬂiers to
citizens.

McCabe stressed that the students
were not arrested. They were, however,
kept for two hours and questioned before

 

Monday, 27 October 1997

Johnny Chang, the Chinese purser on the
Semester at Sea vessel, went ashore to
discuss the situation with the authorities.

He explained that the whole thing
was just a misunderstanding due to a
lack of communication between the
Chinese authorities and the American
students.

Bob Vieira, the Semester at Sea fall
administrative dean, called a meeting
with the faculty and students on board
the ship to discuss the situation and to
provide everyone with ideas for class
assignments so incidents such as this do
not recur, McCabe said.

McCabe could not release the names
of the students involved and said the fax
he received from the ship did not speci-
fy whether those detained were Pitt stu-
dents.

He said he was “pretty sure” that
they were not.

BOARD

“Members of the faculty ought to
know that the administration did an out-
standing job on their behalf with respect
to this program,” he said.

Connolly was initially opposed to
any type of bonus plan. He credited
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and
Provost James Maher with successfully
lobbying for the incentive plan.

“I supported this plan because of my
belief in what Mark and Jim are trying to
do for our programs. I cannot be asking
them to do that without supporting a

FROM PAGE 1

program they think is necessary,”,

Connolly said.

Connolly also applauded adrninis-
trators’ efforts to keep negotiations out
of the media.

“This issue, more than any other,
made it clear that Mark and I are able to
resolve difficult issues without dragging
this board into a public punch-out,” he
told board members. i

N ordenberg agreed.

“I think it shows we have a con-
structive working relationship,” he said.

PRO-LIFE

because they did not witness the incident,
they would not arrest him. They told him
that he could protest against the crosses
and say what he wanted, but that if he
touched anything, they were going -to
arrest him.

"The police told us that he is allowed
to exercise his freedom of speech, but he
can't touch anything or it would be a vio-
lation of ours [freedom of speech],"
Reynolds said.

According to Katie Sullivan, a
Students for Life member, the police
escorted members of the organization to
the Judicial Board's office in the student
union to file a complaint against" the man.

A Judicial Board employee said the
oﬂice could not comment on the man's
identity or reveal any other details about

_ the case.

The accused vandal could not be
reached for comment about the incident.

Sullivan said the organization
obtained permission to set up the display
from the reservations office. But, she said,

FROM PAGE 1

the Students for Life had to be off the lawn
by late that afternoon because another
group had reserved it for the evening.

According to Reynolds, Cemeteries
for the Innocent are erected nationwide by
pro-life groups who believe that they paint
a stark picture that is often effective in get-
ting the organization's message across.

"The 168 crosses on the union lawn
represent the 4,400 abortions that take
place every day in the United States," said
Students for Life member Matt McKim.

Reynolds said that several passers-by
said negative things about the pro-life
message, but that the group generally
received positive comments from those
walking by.

Kristen Panico, the Students for Life
acting president, said the organization
doesn't want to dwell on the incident. She
said that the reason for the crosses‘ pres-
ence was more important.

"What happened goes to show how
powerful the Cemetery for the Irmocents
is," Panico said. a l

THE PITT NEWS

Face the Nation host says the
news should serve the public

Anthony Breznican
Edltor In chlef

As the chief Washington conespondent
for CBS News, Bob Schieffer is more than
an expert in national politics —— he knows
the politics of journalism.

The veteran reporter and host of the
public alfairs program "Face the Nation"
spoke at Pitt Friday night about the impor-
tance of reporting all the news all of the time
and letting the public
decide what is irnpor—
tant and what is not.

“People often want
to know where the
news comes from,” he
said. “The truth is, peo-
ple only teH you things
when it becomes bene-

that news out. For
example, when I cov-
ered the Pentagon, the
best stories about the
Air Force always came
ﬁom the Army, and the
best stories about the

increasingly evident through recent White
House scandals involving illegal campaign
fund raising.

Schielfer, who says he was one of the
last people at CBS to argue for extended
convention coverage during last year’s pres-
idential election, said coverage of future con-
ventions will be lessened because they have
become too much like “Detroit auto shows,
where they roll out a new model, the
reporters kick the tires
and then go back and
write about it.”

He said politi-
cians' need to raise
money so they can buy
“television time” to
attack their opponents is
depleting the time they
spend working for their
constituents. He said
this method of cam-
paigning has also
reduced American poli-
tics to a television pro-
gram that viewers “can
change the channel on?’

Because Such Washington cerrespondent He Said that

information is often self-serving to the per-
son who revealed it, Schielfer said it is the
journalists job to research and present the
information in a way that serves the public.

“If it is pursued, the truth has a way of
showing itself,” he said. “Our sole purpose is
to serve the public.” '

Schieﬂ°er, who has covered Washington
for more than 25 years on CBS, has covered
the White House, the Pentagon, the State
Department and Capitol Hill all four
major beats in the nation’s capital. He has
also covered every presidential campaign
and Republican and Democratic National
Convention since 1972.

Through his years of television journal-
ism, Schielfer said he has seen the medium
drastically change the face of politics.
“[Politicians] spend much of their time on
television raising money so they can get
back on television,” he said

He said this problem is becoming

although many jomnalists are criticized for
focusing on the personal lives of politicians,
it is important to report such stories and let
the public decide what is important.

“I don’t see how you can not report a
story like Paula Jones. This is a lawsuit
against the president Before the [1992] elec-
tion, the Gennifer Flowers scandal broke,
but the people seemed to decide it wasn’t
important and elected [Clinton] anyway,”
Schielfer said

“The job of a journalist is to tell a
democracy about itself in order that mem-
bers of that democracy can make decisions
about how they’d like to live.” '

The speech was part of the Second
Annual Al McDowell Pittsburgh Media
Forum, named for the late Pittsburgh news
anchor and talk show host. Preceding the
speech, Pitt student Stephanie Huszar, a non-
ﬁction major, was awarded a partial scholar-
ship from the Al McDowell memorial Fund

China's president visiting in style

Across the Nation

HONOLULU, Hawaii — Chinese
President Jiang Zerrrin has gotten the
red-carpet treatment upon his arrival in
the United States, but officials say his
visit won't be all warm and fuzzy.

Wherever he goes, Jiang will be
greeted by protesters demonstrating
against China's policies on human
rights, religious persecution and abor-
tion.

Democratic Senator John Kerry of
Massachusetts told CNN he can't think
of anything better to get America's
point of view across.

Jiang was given a 21-gun salute and
reviewed a military honor guard upon
his arrival in Honolulu. Later that day,
he laid a wreath at Pearl Harbor.

During his week-long visit, Jiang
also will visit Williamsburg, Va.;
Philadelphia, New York, Boston and
Los Angeles.

Sig N’ Dales raises some eyebrows and money for charity

Nora O'Neill

Staff Wrlter

Screaming women. Bright lights.
Tear—away pants.

Those were the sights to’ be seen
Friday night at the Sig n’ Dales male
review held in the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union.

The event has become the traditional
kickoff to the Sigma ‘Chi Fraternity‘s
annual charity drive. T h i s

year's charity, the Children's Miracle

She said

Network, received $5
from each one of the 240
voyeuristic fans in atten- ‘
dance.

Several teams made
up of two or three Sigma
Chi brothers and pledges
showed almost all in the
name of charity to such
spirited tunes as the theme
to "Mission Impossible,"
"Start Spreading the
News" and the classic
New Kids on the Block
tune, "Hangin' Tough."

The young men
paraded into the audience,
dancing with women and
collecting dollar bills in
their G-strings, before they were auc-
tioned off to the highest bidder at the con-
clusion of the show. Some persons, like
sophomore Jackie Madden, admired the
dancers’ gumption.

"There is no way I could go up there,"
she said. "I give them a lot of credit."

Many of the performers said they had
no problem stripping to their G-strings in
front of the large crowd. Scott Lombardi,
a freshman, enjoyed his performance.

" I was nervous,_ but it was the best
time I ever had," he said. "I didn't care
what I was doing."

Fred Boutros, a Sigma Chi alumnus,
was another performer. Boutros, a former
professional dancer, snipped while per-
forming such tricks as ﬁre eating.

Boutros expressed his satisfaction
with participating in the annual charity
event.

"This event has been going on for at
least 10 years," he said, "and all of the
money is going to such a great cause."

Others had similar enthusiasm for the
event. Jessica Hartman, a junior and
Sigma Chi Sweetheart, endorsed the
event.

"It's a great way for the guys to have

fun and make money for a worthy charity

at the same time," she said.

, Erin Brett, a freshman,
purchased a date with one
of the dancing brothers
and had a great time at the
show.

"I had so much fun," she
said. "I thought it was so
cool when the guy lit him-
self on fire."

Despite the enjoyment
that several persons got
out of the show, at least a
few persons had a differ-
ent opinion of the scantily
clad men dancing before
them.

Nathan Sheer, a
Louisiana Tech student,
was attending the Lambda

Sigma National Honor Society conven-

tion in the ballroom, the room adjoining

the Sig n‘ Dales show. He caught a

glimpse of the action and said he was

appalled.

"I can't believe they can do that," he
said. "It's in very poor taste. I don't care
what charity it's for. It's disgusting."

Kelly Reszetylo, a sophomore, was
surprised that the Sig n' Dales event could
take place in the student union.

‘'1 have gone to this event for the last
two years, and it is funny, but I cannot
believe that they get away with doing it on
campus."

Sibel Bilgin felt that some of the strip-
pers‘ attire was anything but attractive.

"The boy who wore the mesh under-

wear was disgusting," she said. "That was
way more than I wanted to see."

Christen Lowery, a sophomore,
agreed. "Some of the guys’ G-strings were
really revealing. IfI had been one of those
girls jumping on stage, I would have been
helping those guys put some more clothes
on, not the other way around," he said.

Jason Schoenberg, a senior organizer
of Sig n‘ Dales show, thought the event
was in good taste, though.

"This event is like a fashion show.
People have a lot of fun at it," he said. "It
raises money for charity, and it breaks up
the monotony of being at Pitt. It's good,
wholesome fun."

Cochran indicated he thought they were students

Cochran did not retum calls concerning his

One worker, who wished not to be named,
said he thought it was disgusting that management

maintenance workers a fair wage. .

Maxwell Schnurer, a graduate student, said “It
seems pretty straightforward that the University
should be able to afford the workers‘ demands.
They can afford a $30,000 raise for the chancellor,
but not for workers who earn less than $30,000 [a
year].”

munications, felt there weren't enough graduate
students or faculty at the rally but went on to say
that there is -"a lot more untapped support out
there."

At the end of the meeting, Kline told every-
one, "We'll be back!"

Clefﬁe reiterated Kline’s statement, saying,
"This is just the beginning. We want to take this

nts.” '

Something mystical about elevators

Jessica

 
 

Attrition slrouln’t lead to
a lower academic quality

It’s not unheard of to ﬁnd classrooms sized for 20

desks packed with 40 desks, and then assigned to a
class with 60 students, all taught by a graduate-student
teaching assistant in his ﬁrst semester ever of lectur-
mg.
Pitt’s faculty—retirement incentive plan is scary
because it sounds as if images like this will become
more and more common at Pitt. Encouraging experi-
enced facultymembers to retire and replacing them
with lower—paid, inexperienced faculty members is
already risking a loss in the quality of a Pitt education.
But the possibility that Pitt will leave those positions
unﬁlled, just to save money, is very precarious.

Pitt administrators talk about attracting more high-
ly capable students. They should realize that the qual-
ity of a Pitt education is one of the most important ele-
ments in realizing that goal. The systems that rank uni-
versities, which students look at when choosing an
institution of higher learning, always include infor1na—
tion like student-to-faculty ratios and the quality of the
learning environment.

Quality is not quantity. Having 60 students in a
classroom meant for 20 is like packing six students in
a dorm room meant for two. If you want to provide a
quality environment, you just don’t do that.

But that’s exactlywhat will happen if these retir-
ing faculty members aren’t replaced with new, ener-
getic and capable teachers.

Leaving faculty positions unﬁlled would mean that
a greater number of students have to be packed into a
class. Or, it would mean that teaching assistants have
to take on a greater load, teaching more classes, grad-
ing more papers and exams and getting paid very little
to do so. The administration may think it can get away
with doing this, but we’re not building cars on an
assembly line here; we’re teaching and training indi-
viduals to be productive members of society. That
doesn’t work if the learning environment at Pitt is
painful for students and teachers alike.

Have you’ ever noticed that
peculiar phenomenon —— that peo-
ple feel obligated to talk in an ele-
vator yet will ignore each other
while standing in line to get food,
sitting next to each other at a foot-
ballgarne,orareinoneofthethree
classes they have together? The
same person who could see you
sobbing into your fried rice at
Schenley’s and_pass on by with no
comment whatsoever, other than
perhaps thinking, “Note to self:
Manchu Wok is not a good idea
today,” nevertheless will begin
chatting to you as though you are
his long-lost best friend if he sees
you in an elevator.

Alotofthis happens,atleastto
me, because Lothrop Ha]l’s eleva-
tors do not even remotely approach
anyone’s idea of safety. Ifyou don’t
understand what I mean, then you
have clearly never been in any of
Lothrop’s elevators.

Perhaps it’s the random bang-
ing noises that emanate from the
elevator shaft, or maybe it’s the fact
that the alarm sometimes goes off
for no apparent reason when some-
one steps inside that makes me
thinklamputtingmylifeinlethal
danger every time I step into an ele-'
vator. Or, it could be that some-
times the elevators stop on every
ﬂoor except the one you wanted to
be on, or occasionally descend or
ascend at warp speed, then come to
a sudden, jarring stop six inches
above the ﬂoor you intended to
visit. It could be those things, or
any number of other little surprises
that our so dearly beloved elevators
hold for the unwary rider.

Itmaybethefactthatdeath
seems likely, in fact, irmninent, that
makes people want to bond with
others in the elevator. After all, ‘if

Here’s _a little elevator saga that

Conservativevalues have stronger moral and ethical basis

Carrie
Hager

Most conservatives are not
wealthy, racist, social-program-
hating religious fanatics. Nor are
most liberals poor, welfare-receiv-
ing, and abortion-loving nonreli-
gious communists. Whether an
individual is liberal or conserva-
tive, they both want’basically the
same things. Both want what is
best for their families and the
country, even though their views
on issues are vastly- different.
Even though I myself am very
conservative, I don’t think liberals
areevil people whomllook down
on. I just feel that conservative
views are better, and not just
because I don’t like most
Democratic politicians. It goes
much deeper than that.
Conservative views are stronger
in many ways, and here are a few
examples:

In some respects, conserva-
tive views are morally stronger.
The issue-of abortion is one such
 Most conservatives are
strongly pro-life. They feel that
the ‘killing of an unborn child is

always morally wrong and should
not be an option that pregnant
women have. This view is much
more humane than the liberal pro-
choice view. No matter how those
in favor of abortion may try to jus-
tify it, saying it is the women’s
choice and so on, the killing of an
unborn child can never be moral-
ly acceptable.

Conservatives are also very
much in favor of welfare reform.
They feel that there are so many
problems with the welfare system,
the problems might only be able
to be solved by getting rid of the
system altogether. This doesn’t
mean that conservatives are
against helping people. When lib-
erals say that conservatives are
against helping people, that is
about as true as saying that Bill
Clinton has never told a lie, which
we all know is just not possible.

It isn’t that conservatives
don’t want to help out, it is just
that they feel it is unfair for people
to get something for nothing
while people who work for a liv-
irrghavetopaythecosts.T‘hecon-
servative view promotes better

-work ethics, which are what built

this country in the ﬁrst place.
There is no reason that living
expenses, college education, etc.,
should be paid to people who
don’t work and aren’t productive
members of society. In many
cases, welfare causes laziness.
Instead of welfare, conserva-
tives are more willing to put
money into things such as food
banks and free child care for
working single mothers. If more
people would have a stronger
work ethic and contribute more to
society, it would be better for
everyone involved As someone
who is struggling right now to pay
for college myself, it really upsets
me that ifI wouldjust go out and
get pregnant and go on welfare,
everything would be paid for, but

‘becauselchoosetobeproductive,

Ihavetopayforotherstotakethe
easy ‘ road.
_ Conservative values also
include reducing taxes, even if it
means less money for govern-
ment programs. Economically,
lower taxes are better because it
would mean. that politicians
would have to stop wasting
money and concentrate the

money only on
the necessities
of government.
Everyone
knows how the
federal govem-
ment likes to

this freedom.
If too many
cuts are made
in the military,
we won’t be
able to defend
ourselves or

waste money, ﬁght in any
so why should : war that may
we let it get  eventually

federal govem-  ,._. ~ . . , cutting the mil-

 

ment more money than it knows
what to do with. Lower taxes
would take money out of the
politicians’ hands and put it into
the hands of individual citizens. If
the individual had more money to
spend, there would be more
money circulating in the econo-
my, thus helping the economy and
the individual at the same time.
Conservatives also feel that a
strong military is very important
for the defense of our country. In
the United States we enjoy free-
dom and little chance of invasion
from governments who want to
take this freedom away. A strong
military is what provides us with

 

 

rtary, but it is cut too much, it
will lose its strength. Right now,
the United States has the most
powerful military in the world.
We can protect ourselves, as well
as any other countries who are
threatened and need our help. Do
we really want this to change?
The bottom line is this:
Liberal isn’t necessarily bad,...but
conservative is better.

Carrie Hager has been a conser-
vative since the eighth grade
when she discovered that it was
liberals who are in favor of abor-
tion and conservativesvwho are
against it.

Promise Keepers

shouldn ’f be

chided for caring

The television news is usually
skipped over in our apartment during
dinner. No one likes to lose an appetite.
When I do sit down at night and ﬂip to
the news, I see rape, murder, lying, steal-
ing, sexism, racism and anything else we
could imagine. Rarely do we hear of
someone who did a good deed. Of
course, it is important to understand the
trials and tribulations of our worlds. To
cram all of the goings—on in our city,
country and world into one hour does
leave little room for a report about how
students helped to clean up the city or a
remarkable teacher who inspires his or
her students.

However, on Friday between classes
I saw a report about a group of men who
were going to pray on the Mall in D.C.
The representative for Promise Keepers
said that they had no political agenda.
From what I understand, the men were
praying and saying that they would love
— love themselves by breaking addic-
tions and such, and love their wives and
families.

What does NOW ﬁnd wrong with
love? The man who was quoted in a
recent newspaper article said “... men
are to be submissive to the Lord and

Lord.” How can someone read into this
statement oppression, inequality, or
“You women can’t take care of your-
selves”? Can you honestly say that love
is sexism or racism?

Something is wrong with the men-
tality of our society if we are ﬁnding

Graffiti was not

harmful, only way
to communicate

I am writing in response to Alison
Novicki’s article speaking against the
chalking of the sidewalks around Pitt’s
campus for National Corning-Out Week.

 

I can understand her point in saying that
the group may have done more harm
than good in expressing its pride, but as
a gay student living at the University of
Pittsburgh, I hope to shed some light on
why that particular group of people may
have chosen to act as it did.

My first real exposure to antigay
antagonfsm at Pitt was during the
Freshman Activities Fair. The Rainbow
Alliance was not present for the first
hour; anothergroup thought it would be
comical if it was to steal the alliance’s
table. The table ﬁnally was recovered
and set up, and as I signed my name to
get more information, I talked with the
president, who said these things happen
all the time. When I became more
involved, with the alliance, I was told of
countless prank calls to the office,
threatening e-mails and very inadequate
backing from the administration in
response to this harassment.

When the alliance attempted to
show an award-winning gay ﬁlm made
in England, The Phoenix accused them
of showing “soft—core British porn.”

Fliers put up for meetings are, with-
out fail, torn down within a day of post-
ing, but ﬂiers promoting hatred toward

gays are left posted for weeks. Some
have even gone as far as to go up to "the
office and harass whoever was answer-
ing the phones.

I would understand Ms. Novicki’s
criticism if this alleged “vandalism”
were done with spray paint or even if the
words were drawn on University build-
ings, but that was not the case. The
chalkings were placed on the ground and
would disappear after one night of rain,
possibly two — it was in no way perma-
nent. I think that more damage was done
to the University grounds through the
bonﬁre last week, but don’t worry about
the University dousing wood and under-
lying grass with gasoline and starting a
conflagration on the Cathedral of
Learning lawn —— the gays are putting
chalk on the sidewalks!

It is true that African Americans and
women were able to overcome the odds
and gain a political voice, but let’s
examine the numbers here at Pitt. There
were 8,298 women on this campus in
1996, and 3,744 African Americans.
There are little more than 100 members
in the Rainbow Alliance attempting to
gain a voice in an undergraduate popula-
tion of 16,049 students. The task is not a
simple one. Fighting against a simple
human ignorance and a lack of under-
standing can be frustrating, or even seem
impossible at times. If a group of gays
decided to voice its opinion in a way that
will leave no visible effects in two
weeks’ time, I can understand its moti-
vation.

TOWNSEND

Panthers win
  with help
from Juan

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — It was the
best of games and mostly the worst
of games. But hey, at least Pitt won
the 55-48 double-overtime slop-a-
thon on Saturday.

Upon entering the press confer-
ence, I asked Head Coach Walt

Harris how he was doing, and he 4

just smirked and said, “I’m still
pinching myself.”

Harris probably should have
been pinching more than himself to
fully realize how absurd the ending
to Pitt’s victory was.

The Panthers were up 16 points

with five minutes left in the game. .

They were up eight points with
two minutes left.

They were up two points with
44 seconds left.

And then overtime.

V They were down seven points in
overtime. .

They were tied in overtime.

They were up seven points in
overtime. *

They won the game.

In the first overtime, Pitt had to
convert a fourth-down play and
then a third—down play before tying
the game on a Pete Gonzalez rush-
ing touchdown. . .

In the second, Gonzalez con-
nected with Hoffart for his seventh
touchdown pass of the game, break-
ing Dan Marino’s school record of
SIX.

Once again, Pitt showed against
Rutgers its adept ability to play to
the level of its opponent’s ability.
With the exception of the season
opener against the Ragin’ Cajuns, a
45-13 stomping and victory, Pitt
has either pushed that intensity
lever up a notch or allowed it to
plummet down annoyingly to the
caliber of its opponent. 8

Against Penn State, the
Panthers stuffed the run and avoid-
ed the predicted blowout by losing
34-17.

They needed two late intercep-
tions to halt two Houston drives in
beating a team that was much less
talented than they were, 35-24.

Against Miami, a blitzing
defense and key turnovers enabled
Pitt to beat a team that boasted bet-
ter athletes, 21-l7.

Near-peril in Piscataway

Brian Knavish
Staff Wrlter

PISCATAWAY, NJ — It was
supposed to be a blowout. It
seems everyone predicted Pitt
would demolish the hapless
Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

And if just the oifensive
statistics were considered,
those predictions would be
accurate. -

The numbers are mind-

boggling. Pitt quarterback Pete
Gonzalez completed 27 of 42
passes for 470 -yards, breaking
the team record for passing
yardage in a game (John
Congerni had 446 against Navy
in 1986). Gonzalez also threw
seven touchdowns, another
school record (Dan Marino
threw six against South
Carolina in 1981).

Pitt racked up 645 yards of
total offense on its way to scor-
ing 55 points. Conventional
wisdom should suggest that Pitt
had indeed achieved the romp
that many had expected.

“You witnessed twotearns
ﬁght to the very end. It’s unfor-
tunate in this game that some-
body had to lose,” said Head
Coach Walt Hanis.

The victory lifted the
Panthers above the .500 mark,
giving them a 4-3 overall
recordanda2-1 markinthe
Big East. Rutgers dropped to 0-
8 and 0-5 inthe conference.

“I noticed our team was
playing tense,” said Harris,
attempting to explain the tight
contest. “Whether it was right
or wrong, our players felt the
pressure was on them that they
had to win.”

The tension was evident in
Pitt’s play early on. After two
touchdown passes by. Rutgers’
quarterback Mike McMahon
and two failed point-afters, Pitt
found itself in an early 12-0
hole.

Kevin Lllley

Sports Editor
PISCATAWAY, NJ. — For over four
hours, the Pitt Panthers and the Scarlet
Knights of Rutgers traded tackles and
touchdowns,fumbles and penalties, defen-
sive lapses and missed extra points.

After it was over, it still wasn’t over.

For the second time in school history,
the Panthers went into overtime. And for
the ﬁrst time in school history, thanks to two
25-yard drives, two key kicks and one
defensive stand, the Panthers won a double-
extra-period shootout, 55-48.

It all started so innocently — with just
over ﬁve minutes left in the game, Pitt was
up by 16 points. Many television stations
had switched over to the 3230 game of their
choice already in progress. On the Knights’
next offensive series, Rutgers quarterback
Mike McMahon was knocked out of the
game after a 10-yard scramble. ‘

But Rutgers wasn’t ﬁnished. Behind
backup Brendan Edmonds, the Scarlet
Knights strung together a quick scoring

drive and a two—point conversion. Still
down by eight, the Knights attempted an
onside kick
Kicker Lee McDonald sent a tumbling
fastball toward the Pitt hands team on the
play, which sped past Panther Vital Joseph
and bounced off Darnell  It fell
harrnlessly behind the front line of Pitt play-
ers.
A sea of scarlet descended on the ball,
and as Dinkins lamented his rniscue,
Rutgers backup nmning back Alan Davis
recovered the wet pigskin and gave control
back to his oﬂ°ense. It would score seven
plays later. The tvvo-point play tied the
game. -

“I’m sure our defense was rocking and
reeling,” said Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris,
“but we let them down. We did a piss-poor
job on that onsides kic .”

While the defense may have been reel-
ing, Harris still sent them back out for the
ﬁrst overtime period after winning the toss.
The pressure was on the Scarlet Knights —
if Rutgers failed to score or could only man-

age a ﬁeld goal, the Panther oifense would
be able to win the game on its next posses-
sron.

But the Knights, who had scored 23 of
their 41 points in the fourth quarter, were
more than up to the challenge. It took
Rutgers four plays to hit pay dirt from the
25-yardline——threerunsbythreediﬂ’er-
ent, rested running backs and an 8-yard
touchdown strike from Edmonds to a leap-
ing Andy Holland.

Pitt’s offense did not begin with such a
ﬂourish. The ﬁrst two Panther plays in the
extra period went for no gain —— an abortive
dive play by Dwayne Schulters and an
incomplete screen play.

VV1th a third-and—10, Harris went with
what had worked the entire ball game —
the downﬁeld air attack. Quarterback Pete
Gonzalez had already thrown for over 400
yards before overtime started, including six
touchdowns. On third down, he earned
seven more on a strike to Jake Hoffart.

The Pittsburgh Lady Panthers had a
tough weekend after being shut out in con-
secutive games by Big East rivals
Connecticut and Seton Hall. The team also
had to play both games in cold, wet weath-

er that seemingly worked against it. On’

Friday, Pitt lost 5-0 to a Connecticut team
that is ranked ﬁfth in the nation. On
Sunday, the team lost 6-0 to the Lady
Pirates of Seton Hall.

The Lady Panthers faced a bruised
and battered Seton Hall team that had just
dropped a very physical game to women’s
soccer powerhouse Notre Dame. The
Panthers also faced a sloppy, cold, rainy
day at a muddy Sewickley ﬁeld. The poor
conditions contributed to most of the mis-
cues and turnovers that allowed scoring
chances for the Pirates.

The Panthers controlled the offense in

T the opening 20 minutes of the game.

Freshman forward Renee Sparninato and
sophomore forward Mia Mora got two
chances for the Panthers deep in Pirate ter-
ritory but came up short. Seton Hall junior
goalkeeper Stacy Nagle came up with two
big saves early on for the Pirates.

But Seton Hall quickly shifted’ the
momentum as sophomore midﬁelder
Kelly Smith scored on a breakaway at the
19:14 mark of the first half. The Panthers
couldn’t get back in time as the speedy
Smith charged in for the goal.

The Pirates added to their lead with

‘ “We came out strong in the first 20
minutes until they scored. They dominated
the last 25 minutes,” said freshman mid-
ﬁelder Charity McClure of the ﬁrst half.

Seton Hall came out ﬁring in the sec-
ond half. Smith took the ball down the
right side, beat two Pitt defenders and net-
ted the ball past a diving Nicole Bashor to
ﬁnish a hat trick.

McClure added a rough style of play
that caused many turnovers and with the
help of Mora, led to many breakaways that
ended in missed opportunities.

Smith. would complete her day with
her fourth goal of the game .at the 72:56
mark on a failed breakaway. Smith
regained control of the ball after a Pitt
defender broke up the play. Smith then
beat Bashor all alone for the goal. Seton

and two assists.

Beasley (#10, in an earlier game vs. Notre Dame) had the only shot vs. Seton Hall.

The loss dropped the Panthers to 2-11-
3 overall, 1-8-1 in the Big East.

On Friday night, the Panthers faced a
tough task in overcoming a Connecticut
squad that went 22-3 last season and
returned seven starters from a team that
went to the NCAA quarterﬁnals last sea-
son.

The Panther defense held its ground in
the ﬁrst 30 minutes of the game by turning
away a Connecticut offense that came out
shooting. Sara Whalen began the scoring
for the Huskies at the 32:09 mark of the
first half as she took a pass from junior for-
ward Cannie Landen for the goal.

Then, two minutes later the Huskies
scored again. This time it was Landen who
netted the goal with assists from Whalen
and junior midﬁelder Jennifer T ietjen.

Landen wasn’t ﬁnished as she put the
Panthers down 3-0 with her second goal of
the game at the 36:55 mark of the ﬁrst
frame. She was assisted with a pass from
senior forward Naomi Stone.

Connecticut spent little time in putting
the game out of reach in the second half
with a goal from freshman forward Jen
Carlson. Her goal was the result of a
penalty kick. She then added another goal
at the 75:20 mark.

Pitt goalkeeper Bashor recorded eight
saves on 26 shots.

The Pitt men’s soccer squad played
two important Big East games this week-
end. Friday it lost a close contest to
Connecticut 4-2. Sunday it was shut out
by the Seton Hall Pirates 1-0.

Pitt entered Friday’s game ranked
16th nationally and looked for revenge
against the Huskies, who defeated the
Panthers 2-0 last year. Connecticut
entered the contest with a six—game
unbeaten streak.

Connecticut and Pitt held each other
scoreless in the ﬁrst 30 minutes of the
game. Both defenses were in high gear,
stopping offensive attacks and not permit-
ting deep zone rushes.

The Huskies penetrated Pitt’s defense
and scored first with a goal from junior
Rocky Niedrowski at the 34:18 mark of

the first half. Niedrowski headed in a long
pass across the goal box from senior Jim
McManus.

Connecticut added to the score ﬁve
minutes later with a goal from sophomore
Alex Cortes. Cortes collected the rebound
off ‘a shot from junior midﬁelder Maurizio
Rocha and beat Pitt goalkeeper Chris
Hanlon for the score.

Connecticut controlled most of the
offense in the ﬁrst half after Niedrowski’s
goal. It outshot Pitt 5-2 in the first frame.

The Panthers would not go down eas-

ily and scored one minute into the second

half. Senior Greg Hoolahan banged in a
26-yard shot off a throw-in from senior
midﬁelder Jason Piombino to bring Pitt
within one. It was Hoo1ahan’s second
goal of the season.

The two - teams would exchange
offensive attacks for most of the second
half.

The Huskies again made it a two—goal
lead as junior forward Gemeil Lorne col-
lected a rebound off Rocha’s free kick at
67:25.

Pitt then fought back with a goal from
sophomore forward Drew Kopp at 75:57
of the second half. Kopp headed in a
deﬂected shot from freshman Ben Garry.

VVrth the score 3-2, Connecticut put
pressure on the Panther defense. Husky
freshman midﬁelder Roberto Vargas
scored on a give-and-go breakaway with
only 12 seconds remaining to seal the vic-
tory for Connecticut.

The Panthers sought to rebound fol-
lowing Friday’s loss, against the Seton
Hall Pirates yesterday afternoon. Seton
Hall had fared well against Big East
teams this season, winning six and losing
three matches.

Pitt controlled the offense early by
attacking deep, but the Panthers couldn’t

execute on their opportunities and were
stopped on three key chances by Pirate
junior goalkeeper Derek Martin.

Pitt managed nine shots on goal in the
first half, with only three reaching Martin.

In the second half, both squads
exchanged attacks, but neither could
break through for a score.

VV1th only nine minutes left, Seton
Hall’s junior midﬁelder Kobie Johnson
broke in and scored from 11 yards out at
81:48 of the second half. Johnson was
assisted by sophomore midﬁelder Jeff
Rigby. V

The Pirates’ beat off the Panthers and

won their seventh in a row, improving ’

their record to 9-6 overall and 7-3 in Big
East play. Pitt’s record dropped to 7-5-4,
and 3-5-3 in the Big East.

Gonzalez touchdown strike, but the
Panthers failed to convert on any of
their extra-point attempts and settled for
an 18-12 halftime lead.

Pitt’s kickers remained on the ﬁeld
at halftime to practice, but it was
Rutgers that got right back to work. The
Knights drove 68 yards to score anoth-
er touchdown, but the point-after try
failed (again), and the game remained
tied at 18.

The Panthers answered with
another Gonzalez touchdown pass, this
one a 26—yarder to Teny Murphy, fol-
lowed by the ﬁrst successful extra-point
of the day.

Pitt appeared to run away with the
game in the fourth quarter. After a Chris
Ferencik ﬁeld goal and Gonzalez
touchdown passes to Murphy and
Hoffart, the Panthers held a comfort-
able 41-25 lead with 5:05 left in the
game  or so they thought.

Backup quarterback Brendan
Edmonds ﬁlled in after McMahon was
injured, and drove Rutgers down the
ﬁeld, throwing a 34-yard touchdown.
He ran the two-point conversion in
himself to cut the Panther lead to eight
with 2:01 left on the clock

Rutgers then lined up for an obvi-
ous onside kick. The ball took a strange
hop on the wet grass, and the Knights
recovered. Edmonds threw another
touchdown and a two—pointer to tie the
game.

sive 25-yard drive that ended when he
leaned the ball in from the 1-yard line
for his only rushing touchdown ~ of the
day.

On to double overtime. This time
Pitt went on oﬁense ﬁrst and Hotfart
caught his third touchdown of the after-
noon, putting Pitt up 55-48. Rutgers
could not score on its possession, so the
ball game, ﬁnally, ended. 1

Gonzalez wasn’t the only Panther
to turn in big numbers (“To come out
here and hit up on Dan Marina is some-

thing,” he said. “I’1l have to‘ joke with
himaboutthatnexttimelseehiminthe
weight room”). Hoﬁart had 12 catches
for 134 yards and three touchdowns,
Murphy grabbed ﬁve passes for 155
yards, and Dwayne Schulters picked up
150 yards rushing on 25 carries.

But -as impressive as the offense
was, the defense and special. teams

were the opposite. The defense gave up

a whopping 542 yards and 48 points,
and the Panthers failed on ﬁve of 10
ﬁeld—goal and ext1a—point attempts.

OVERTIME  .....7

thing he rarely does —— he juggled a pass by Gonzalez
that hit him squarely in the numbers. The receiver still
managed to hold on and fall over at the 11-yard line, eam-
ing Pitt a game—saving ﬁrst down.

A 9-yard completion to Schulters set up three
straight dives toward the end zone by the Panthers.
Gonzalez was successful on the third, leaning in behind
center Andrew Grischow for the score.

But Pitt was still down by a point, and in a game
where the Panthers had botched four extra-point
attempts, kicker Chris Ferencik’s task was no longer con-
sidered a sure thing.

Harris called the early point-afters “a comedy of
errors,” but kept his faith in Ferencik to the very end. He
was rewarded with a garne-tying kick

Rutgers won the second ovenime toss and elected to
defend the opposite end zone, causing the sparse crowd
to move from one corner of the stadium to the other for
a better view and a chance to disrupt Pitt’s offense. But
behind Gonzalez, who by now had broken Pitt’s single-
game passing yardage mark and tiedDan Marino’s sin-

’ gle-garne touchdown record, the Panthers came up with

a ﬁve-play scoring drive, capped by Holfart’s touchdown
catch that was made despite a holding call on Hoifarfs
defender.

“I’m very conﬁdent [in overtime] ,” said Gonzalez,
“because in overtime, ‘a lot of teams play timid. If you
play that way, you’re rolling the dice on us.”

It appeared that Rutgers could answer Gonzalez’s
troops, as the Knights gained 12 yards on two quick pass
plays. On the next play, Rutgers tried an option pitch for
the ﬁrst time all game. Before Edmonds could dump the
ball, he was met headﬁrst by Pitt’s Chiffon Allen. As the
quarterback fell over, he attempted a pitch that had no
momentum behind it. Running back Jacki Crooks
pounced on the ball, but the Scarlet Knights couldn’t

recover from their loss of momentum.

COLUMN

Then, there was the embarrass-
ing loss to Temple. In that game,
Pitt played with as much energy as
the prof who recites “Bueller” to a
comatose class in the John Hughes
classic.

And despite the opening kickoff
(if you can call it that) that was
returned for a score, and the rest of
the kicking miscues (a touchdown
return on an onside kick, a short
missed field goal and those woeful
Grant Coffield punts), Pitt played
with Notre Dame in a 45-21 loss.

Going into the swamps of New
Jersey to play the Scarlet Knights,
Pitt was favored by more than 10
points, coming off a bye week and
playing a perennial Big East weak-
ling. All the scenarios and signs of
the 17-14 loss to Temple.

FROM PAGE 7

And Saturday, Pitt started off as ‘

ﬂat as a Roseanne Barr/Arnold/etc.
rendition of the national anthem. In
its first three possessions, Coffield
punted twiceand Gonzalez fumbled
a snap away to Rutgers. After an
RU touchdown, Pitt began a drive
that stalled at the 16-yard line.
Chris Ferencik’s 33-yard kick was
blocked, and then Rutgers proceed-
ed to march down and score anoth-
er touchdown to go up 12-0.

Pitt needed a spark —— some-
thing it never got in the Temple
game. It was starting from its own
5-yard line. With six minutes
remaining in the half, the vaunted
»West‘Coast Offense hadn’t yet com-
pleted a pass of over five yards.

Enter junior tight end Juan
“Sweet as Sugar” Williams. On
first down, Gonzalez (who
bestowed the nickname on Juan)
drilled Sugar with a 9-yard comple-
tion over the middle. Now with
some confidence, Gonzalez would
go on to hit three passes in a row
and march Pitt down the field for a
touchdown.

The Knights could do nothing
with the ball on their next posses-
sion and gave the ball back to Pitt
with just under a minute left in the
first half.

On Pitt’s first play, Gonzalez
rainbowed a pass up the seam of the
Rutgers zone and into the out-
stretched hands of a streaking
Sugar, who. rambled for 67 yards
and a touchdown. This tied the
game and began a record-breaking
day for the Pitt offense.

And with just a little “Sugar,”
guts and some luck, Pitt escaped
from the swamps with one pinky
nail hanging onto the 55-48 victory.

Matt Townsend is the assistant
sports editor of The Pitt News and
loved his Saturday afternoon in the
swamps. [
