Internal, External

Look   At Racism

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

It was one search of concerned
students into a problem of society.
Not the total problem — but their
part of it. “Racism —— that which
is external to me and internal of
me” was the theme of the third
Look at Racism session held Tues-
day night in the SU Ballroom.

The turnout for the round table
discussion groups was more modest
than past sessions have attracted.
Tuesday night’s discussion was
more specific in tone, it dealt
with the conditions in the com-
munity.

Although the moderator insist-
ed upon classifying the speakers
she introduced as to their respec-
tive “communities,” three black
leaders who prefaced the dialogu- 1
ing talked about the “community”
that is most relevant to the au-
dience, the University.

Speaking softly and without aid
of a microphone, Hiawatha Foun-
tain attacked the University on
its feeble attempts to “do some-
thing about racism.” A former
worker in the Urban League Foun-
tain pointed out a paradox.

While the University had failed
to “deal with the feelings of
black students, their life styles,
and how they learn,” he said, “we
are not ready to accept anything
you have to offer for this society.
It’s not good enough for us.”

“Niggers”

Fountain cajoled the students.in
his small audience to examine
where they are at, too. “It’s not
good enough for you either. Most
of you are niggers. That word’s
not based on skin, or hair color.”

But the speaker had had it with
words and symbolic gestures. The
only alternative, insisted Fountain,
was to get up and go to war, with
time and money.

Still concerned with the Uni-
versity community, Ralph Proc-
tor, Assistant to the Dean of the
College of the Arts and Sciences,
was adamant in insisting that the
problem is in the here-and - now.

“We’re supposed to be students
who are interested in change,” he
said, “Well, it doesn’t take a bit
of guts to come here and get in-
volved. It does take guts to go home
and tell dad and mon and the 10-

: cal minister that they are racists.”

The University is a racist in-
stitution, Proctor proclaimed, and
it’s proven every day. “This in-
stitution is racist because the vast
majority of people here don't be-
lieve that it is; it’s racise because
there is a need for a black studies
program; it’s racist because a
whole bunch of gusy sat around for
years and let the University go
merrily on its way and never pro-
tested.”

He concluded by echoing Foun-
tain and pushing his audience to
get off their duffs, quit talking
and go to work. -

Mixed Audience

The audience, racially mixed
and seated around ten circular
tables, listened to a different as-
pect of the same theme Roland
Saunders, President of the Pitts-
burgh Branch of the National Al-'
liance of Postan and Federal Em-
ployees.

“The problems are no differ-
ent on the job than in the class-
room,” he pointed out. “It’s the
same problem as trying to get into
the University.”

Students cannot afford to lock
themselves into an ivory tower of
college graduates will be the ones
who will assume the major posi- '
tions in industry, they must face
and fight the problem of racism
as they find it in the University.$a

“You’ve got to get out and
relate to the guy that’s been de-
nied. You’ve got to take the fight
on to the job and into the fields
that you are going into.”, he con-
cluded.

Black and white, student and
facilitator, as the three speakers
concluded, the student, black
and white retired to dialogue;
they asked one another what
they were going to do.

Students Attend Meeting

by ELANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer

Next month, for the second time
in the University’s history, stu-
dent observers will be present at
a meeting of the University Board
of Trustees. Last October, after
a series of confrontations with the
Board and University administra-
tors, students gained the right to
have representatives present at
Trustee meetings. At future
meetings, students will have the
opportunity toiobserve the pro-
ceedings, although they will not
have voting power on matters
that come before the Board for
approval.‘

Vice Chancellor of Finance,
Edison Montgomery, one of those
present at all Trustee meetings,
experssed’ his satisfaction with the
student observer policy adopted
and approved by the Board.

“The only actions that must be
voted on by the Board of Trus-
tees are those which require ap-
proval solely by Trustees under
the By-laws of the University,”
Montogomery explained when ask-
ed why students do not have vot-
ing power. The approval of legal

mately 8:30, a small fire star-
ted "on the seventh floor of
North Holland Hall. No stu-
dents were in the room, 736A,
at the time the fire started,
and no one was hurt.

University Housing Director,
John Vrana, estimated the cost
of the ‘damage to be $250. The
fire reportedly started in the waste-
basket. then spread to the bed and
the side of a’ desk. A resident as-
sistant on the floor set off a fire
extinguisher and pulled the alarm.
All of the students were evacuat-
ed lrom Holland Hall to the
Towers Lob y.

Five fire trucks arrived on
Forbes Avenue, and by 8:50
the fire was out completely. Uni-
versity security police and fire-
men inspected the damage and
the cause of the fire.

Mr. Vrana stated, “The students
thought quickly and safely in
handling this affair, and their
overall response was excellent.”

actions by the University, such
as borrowing funds and accepting
bond issues are matters reserved

for Board of Trustee action.»

Student voting power feels
Montgomery, would be ineffec-
tive and unnecessary on such
matters.

“The last thing to be present-
ed at a Trustee meeting is a con-
troversial issue,” Montgomery
said as he attempted to clarify

any mis-conceptions concerning"

the function of the Board of
Trustees. 5

Montgomery stressed that at all
Board meetings, aside from the
approval of actions required by
University By-laws, the Trustees
hearonly formally prepared re-

: ports of what has occurred at the

University during the interven-
ing three months since, the last
meeting. The Chancellor, a mem-
ber of the faculty or administra-
tion, and one of the members of
the Standing Committee of the
Board of Trustees often simply
read their reports to the Trus-
tees.

man Mailer (as the mayoralty
candidate) for president of the
New York City Council; the duo
took as one of its major platforms
the “abolition” of thecity into a
state. He later ended up support-
ing Lindsay.)

A newspaper man from way
back and _former syndicated col-
umnist of the New York Post,
Breslin is now going around.pre-
dicting that newspapersare dying
in the 20th century “and deserved-
ly so.” He told his youthful audi-
ence to read the Pittsburgh papers
and they would see what he meant.

“Your writing ability doesn’t
keep you on newspapers today,
"but your ability to keep a check
high for a few days,” he quipped
roughly. “If you work on a paper,
you should belong to a guild or bet-
ter yet get the Mafia to back you.”

In disgust, he dropped out of
newspapers and decided to write
a book about “something crazy,”
gangsters. He» caused a little stir
and ran into Jack Newfield and
Norman Mailer along the way,
two “guys that also did a little
writing."

The coalition of Breslin and
Mailer, described as one of the
four _or five last original minds,
tried to make it in politics outside
the system. “Nomore bullshit"
was their campaign slogan and it
succeeded in turning off a lot of
people. If the junior high kids
“could have voted we would have
beat Lindsay."

The working-through-the-sys-
tem story applies to the Moratori-
um, Breslin pointed out. Although
he “took the kids there, it was
beautiful,” there was no one there
who worked with his hands; the

Chancellor and Vice Chancel-
lors, students and faculty, and

the Board of Trustees. Aside from

approving formal legal matters,

one of the most important powers

of the Board of Trustees is the

power to hire the Chancellor,”_
Montgomery said.

According to the Vice Chan- . 

cellor, not even the decision to
make research grants to the var-

--ious University departments rests

with the Trustees. Last fall, the

Trustees were accused of approv- , 1

ing research grants that were de-
signed by anti-war groups as “war
grants” sponsored by the Univer- ~
sity to aid the government’s war

“The responsibility to‘ makea
research grant, evenfor a“ war

grant, has been delegated to the .

Dean of the school contemplating

such research,” Montgomery’stres- .

sed. “All these research grants
are supposedly aimed at advanc-
ing human knowledge. It is the
Dean’s responsibility to ascer-
tain that the planned research
should not in any way be harm-
ful to human life.

union leaders themselves are be- ..

yond redemption, believed the short,
stocky but flamboyant speaker.

You have to play the game if
you want to win in politics, Bres-
lin said. He and Mailer tried to
avoid the “bullshit” and get down
to the issues, like the importance
of the housing crisis, the war and
narcotics traffic which is the,
basis for 65 per cent of the as-
saults in'the city. But the people\
didn’t want to hear this: “Their
chairs scraped the floor; only this
time, they looked like they were
going to throw them at us,” Bres-
lin remembered.

He and Mailer’s plan to “stati-
fy” the city of New York could
have helped to relieve to an ex-
tent black-white tensions, he
claimed. “The union leadership is
causing all the trouble,” he pro-
posed. “They wouldn’t let blacks
into the place except with a broom
to mop out the headquarters.” The

city, already a “pioneer of this “

war," should be able to make fur-
ther progress when the city is less
congested, when, after 5 o’clock,
there are only four million peo-
ple there.

But at this point, "Jimmy Bres-

-lin has more or less had it with

politics: on one hand, there’s
Lindsay “who is giving good in-
tentions a bad name”; on the other
side. there’s the Mafia. Breslin
has come to the conclusion that‘
victory isn't worth the hassle of
politics. His last official act in
politics was to teach Lindsay
something about baseball.

“Anyway, suppose I did win in
politics, where would I be any-
way——right in the system that I’ve
been trying to fight,” Breslin ask-
ed.

Community Awareness

As a follow up to this fall's Mor-
atorium activities, a group of stu-
dents and other University related
people are organizing activities
related to peace and community
awareness. In a Meeting Wednes-
day, in Room 306 of the Student
Union, a tenative outline was giv-
en.

One of the first activities plan-
ned by the group is a canvass of
Pittsburgh neighborhoods to get
an idea of how the people feel
about the war, the government
and other problems such as local
taxes, road conditions in the city,
and other municipal issues. The
canvassers, at least at first, will
not attempt to convince people of
one view or another, but will mere-
ly try to determine the mood of
the people, and the issues that are
relevant to them.

These activities will not be on
the order of the mass marches of

the past, but will be a continuing.

views, and achieving its goals.
There are many ways to change
our society that are not anti-estab-

ple in the community that there

are ways to be heard. it is hoped
that they will use these ways to

Research Program Nearly Hidden

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Feature Writer

In the winter of 1967, five
Pittsburgh institutions of higher
learning combined faculty strength
in order to conduct a teaching

and research program in Comprara-

tive Communism. The University
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon
University, Chatham College, Du-
quesne University, and Carlow
College cooperated on the project,
made possible by a grant from the
Carnegie Corporation of New
York, a foundation with particular

interest in education and in pub-
lie and international affairs. The
purpose of this effort was to gather
all relevant courses in Compara-
tive Communism and then to teach
it across the board. ’

Because of the scant publicity
given to this program, many stu-
dents are unaware of its existance.
Through the inter-university con-
struction of the program, cour-
ses in Comparative Communism
are available to Pitt students at
any of the five institutions of
higher learning in Pittsburgh, with
‘the majority of the courses being-
taught here. In an effort to pro-
vide a program in Comparative
Communism wherever it exists,
courses relating to Comparative
Communism in Economics, His-
tory, Political Science, Sociology,
Slavic, and Philosophy are now
available to upperclass under-
graduates. Enough courses now
exist, for it to be possible to self-
design a major in this field.

Because of the wide range of
fields, generalized courses are
rare. The professors ‘teaching the
classes have specialized in cer-
tain facets of Comparative Com-
munism, and are able to offer
their extensive knowledge and ex-
perience to their students in
courses such as the Soviet Bloc
(Political Science 112), taught by
Dr. Carl Beck, head’ of the pro-
gram. A high degree of specializa-
tion can beattained in such cour-

ses. Comparative Communist Eco-
nomic Systems (Economics 168)
is another example. This course
offers a comparative analysis of
the organization and operation, in
theory and in practice. of the eco-
nomic systems of Communist
China, the USSR. and Eastern
Europe. The command economy in
its classic soviety form and in its
Chinese version are contrasted
and compared with varieties of
socialism developing with the
economic reforms in the USSR
and, particularly Eastern Europe.
Basic topics include the nature
and goals of planning; com-
mand versus market mechanism;
alternative approaches to the agri-
cultural problem; incentives and
income, distribution; interna-
tional relations; and growth and
performance. In this course, and
in most Comparative Communism
courses, a prerequisite of one or two
introductory coursesin the speci-
ific field usually exists. However,
exceptions are made to this re-
quirement. Students desiring to
participate in these courses
should consult with their col-
lege advisors for specific regis-
tration procedures.

In conjunction with the tea-
ching program, a research pro-
gram in Comparative Communism
was also established in 1967. Since
the inception of this program, the
joint faculty committee has ac-
cepted three research proposals.
These seminars are all faculty
and student seminars. The first,
the Seminar on Communist Eco-
nomic Studies, is a two year pro-
gram and is proceeding with the
presentation of papers and the com-
pilation of materials for eventual
publication of the results of the
study. The goal of the Seminar on
Communist Political Leadership,
the‘-second research project, is to
produce a series of monographs on

the behavioral, structural and attitu-

dinal characteristics of com-
munist leaders in a compara-
tive tone. The newest research

seminar in the program focuses on
Peasant and Social Change—A
Comparative Analysis of the For-
mation of Modern Social Sys-
tems. The seminar, which com-
menced a year ago, is endeavor-
ing to add a non-communist di-
mension to the comparative study
of communist societies..Over a
two-year period, a research sem-
inar will be developed in which
scholars from the University
and other American and Euro-
pean institutions will be asked to
contribute monographs and sem-
inar papers. These papers will
serve as a basis for a formal sem-
inar to be held at the University
and for a research symposium to
be held at some future time. The
group of scholars includes his-
torians, anthropologists, political
scientists. and geographers. They
will organize their subject around
three themes: (a) the origins and
development of peasant move-
ments; (b) inter—relations between
the larger society and the peasant
community; and (C) the effects
of peasant characteristics and
peasant movements on the nation
modernization process.

Dr. Schulman, whose topic will
be’ “The Peasant Revolution in
China,” received his doctorate in
Government from Columbia Uni-
versity in 1967. Recently, he spent

FREE PRISONERS

Students from two University
organizations combined to demand
release of two Israeli civilians
held prisoner by Syria yesterday.

Students for Israel and B’nai
B’rith Hille collected petitions on
the ground floor of the Cathedral
of Learning. The petitions will be
sent to the United Nations and the
Airline Pilots Union.

The Israelis became Syrian
prisoners on August 29, 1969 when
their TWA flight was hijackedgby
two Arabs before it landed at
Athens airport on its way to
Tel Aviv. The Syrians released all
the passengers and crew im-
mediately, except six Israelis. Four
Israeli women were later released,
but the two men are apparently
in a prison camp.

Mike Wax, Students for Israel
chair commented, “We cannot al-
low two innocent civilians, cap-
tured when an American airplane
was illegally rerouted to Syria,
to continue to suffer under such
inhumane conditions.”

Culture Unit
Set-Up For

Next Term

The Intercultural House, one of
the few in the nation, has chosen
membership to move into the
House in January. The 20 male-
undergraduates, ten black and ten’
white, have already met to dis-
cuss the set—up and structure for .
the House.

The basic idea of the House is

to establish a living unit based on « ‘

separate cultures living together
in mutual respect. The House is
sponsored by the Gertrude Stein
Foundation of Pittsburgh and
the University. j

John Tyler of the political" 1' it
science department, spokesman ,
for the project, stated that a search . .

is still on for a faculty member
to live at the House to provide
yet another aspect in the exchange
of ideas.

Tyler noted that besides wish-
ing to have members from dif-
ferent cultures, the selection com- ',
mittee chose members with var- V

iety of interests in academic dis-  I
cipline, political beliefs, and in- ’

dividual life styles.

The House, located at 272 N.
Dithridge, is somewhat character-
istic of a commune-like life, com-
mented Tyler. “One of the fas-
cinating things about the program
is that the students themselves
are deciding how the House will

be run. They're starting from the ,

bottom to deal together.”

“The people are good,” assert-
ed Tyler. “They don’t know ex-
actly where they’re going, but.
they’re optimistic and they want
to go somewhere.

The students who will be liv-
ing in the House are: Richard’

  Closed Out

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

Where have all the teachers gone?
Large, large classrooms . . .
Where have all the courses gone?
They all are closed.
Where have all the students gone?
Tuition paying eveyone.
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?

These words indicate what is happening here at the
University as undergraduate students register for next
term.

Seniors are finding that courses are closed, or not of-
fered at all. Graduation may still come in April or June,
but many desired courses will be replaced by any old course
that will fill the schedule and add three more credits. What
will they learn? When wil they learn they don’t have to put
up with not having courses they want?

What about the juniors, , sophomores, and freshmen?
When will they ever learn that they’re being cheated when
half of them find the majority of classes closed to them when
they register? That’s right. According to figures released
from the College, over 50 per cent of the underclassmen and
women find less than half the courses they want still open to
them when they register. Yet they pay as much tuition as the
students who get allthe courses they want.

“Well that’s just the way it is in a large University”
most students will say. But, it doesn’t have to be. Why
can’t courses be offered after students register for them, ac-
cording to the desires of the students. Naturally, every stu-

I dent will never get every course he or she wants over a four

year period, but when the number of students who can’t even
pick from half of the possible courses offered reaches the 50
per cent mark, it is time to do something about the situ-
ation.

The University needs more undergraduate professors in
certain departments, namely English, Psychology and for new
CAS courses offered by the College. These new professors
will cost the University money. But the tuition money un-
dergraduates now pay goes for graduate research as well as
undergraduate teachers. So, until they have the courses and
number of teachers they deserve, I suggest undergrads stop
paying tuition to support research, while they are being cheat-

‘ ed in their education.

But how many more students would rather rationalize
their being cheated and complain about closed and over-
crowded courses than admit they’re being cheated and do
something about it. _

If the current trend continues, there will be so many stu-

dents and so few courses offered, registration may be on the

‘ Cathedral lawn, with the Chancellor drawing students’ names

and their courses for the next term out of a large glass jar,

with anxious students watching to see the fate of their educa-
tion evolve.

Reflections of the Spleen

The Human Thing To Do”

by MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist

(Dedicated to Jonathan Swift,
whose spleen may still be alive.).

The population explosion is
quite possibly the most serious
problem facing our world today.
Indeed, I have hard it said that
if the world’s population continues
to increase at its present rate The
Earth won’t be able to feed itself
by as early as the next decade.

In spite of this, science and
medicine go on blindly creating
methods and making what they
call “advances” in areas designed
to prolong life. For the world’s
sake and the safety of us all, it is
time we did an abrupt about-
face and looked at the problem
rationally and humanitarianly.

We should start to design meth-
ods of decreasing the world’s pop-
ulation instead of increasing it.
Birth control is only a minor step
toward solving our problem, and
now is the time for us to realize
this. How hypocritical we are —
we sanction birth control pills to
decrease population, but perform
heart-transplants. to increase it. The
only type of hearts we should be
transplanting are diseased or
broken ones.

And what about all this con-
cern with air and water pollu-
tion? What better way can we
cut down on life expectancy than
to contaminate two of the essen-
tials to our precisous bodies?
we should start thinking positively
about these so-called “Problems”
and realize that they may even-
tually be the greatest boone to
mankind since the atomic bomb.. '

I say that if we put warnings on
our cigarette packs, we should also
put precautionary notes on won-
der drugs, for they, in the long
run, will be the death of us all.
If nobody dies, how can we live?
If populations increase as ex-
pected, soon there won’t be space
enough to move around! There
fore, is it so unreasonable to sug-
gest that we use all of the earth’s
available space and put people in
it as well as on it?

Perhaps theonly solution to this
problem is world war. After all,
the world really hasn’t had a good
war for about twenty-five years
Korea and Viet-nam are just drops
in the casket as compared to the
really big ones.

It seems to me that the United
States and Russia could join to-
gether, pool their weapons, and
destroy those hot—beds of popula-

tion, India and China. Think of
the humanitarian motivation. And
all the empty space we could
create. Why, we could redistri-
bute Europe and Central America’s
populations, thus thinning out their
own overcrowded conditions. But
we must exercise caution in wag-
ing war, for too often a war—time
economy creates prosperity, and
prosperity creates you—know-what.

Therefore. we had better make
sure that we thin ourselves out
a little; for example, we could
obliterate Moscow and let the Rus-
sians return the favor by obliter-
ating New York.

I know these measures sound a
little radical, but perhaps the time
for radicalism is here. We are hu-
mans. These measures are the
only human things we can do.

  Living In The Past?

by PAUL STROLLER
Special to the Pitt News

Tera, niger

Back about six months ago, I_
guess I was a radical of sorts.
I had myself a nice beard, wore
blue-geans, wrote nasty editorials
against the establishment, hated
god-damn materialism, wanted to
screw the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
was afraid of 9 to 5 middle class
life and was terrified of becom-
ing an automation in a computer-
ized society.

But I guess radical was the
wrong term then. Like most radi-
cals, I really thought myself, to
be reactionary. I longed for a slow-
paced life in which human rela-
tionships were real. I desperately
wanted to live in the past; I
wanted to forget about the present
and future — the war, the draft
and all that crap.

Looking back upon background
and philosophy, it seems that living
in the past is a rather bad thing.
After all, it was either Sarte, cam-
pus, or good old Rabbi Richard
L. Rubenstein who said that the
“past is dead.” And they were
right. In the United States living
in the past. is living in fantasy land.
And one thing that I cherish is
cold. brutal, reality. Brutal harsh
truth is a curious dialectic: its
painful and beautiful at the same
time.

You just can’t live in the past
when there is all that electricity,
and stuff. Hell, with all those
skyscrapers in New York, you
just can’t live in the past. The
only glimpse of the past exists in
a movie or perhaps a Television
show. But of course the old idiot
box does more to modernize the
“wilds of the U.S.A." than any
other modern device.

When I came to Africa (God —
if he.exists —— bless the day) I
was in the presence of modern ty-
pical frustrations — television,
people with modern—type hang-
ups, automobile fumes. big cities
with paved streets. modern restau-
raunts, and people dressed in a
western style suits.

But now all of that is changed.
coming to Tera is like taking a
plunge off the cliff of time. And
I’m still flying through that end-
less chasm that has no beginning
or end. .

When I look out my window, I
don’t see fumes in the sky, I

don’t see tall buildings which all,

look the same. No, that is beyond
my vision now. I’m 8,000 miles
and years away from that world.
No, I guess I live very quietly
in my concrete house on the
school compound in Tera. There’s
not much noise around Tera ex-
cept for the Thursday afternoon
market. Hell, you can hear it for
miles.

Other than that, things are pret-
ty quiet except for the occasional
bark of a thin hungry dog, or the
bowl of a hungry African cow.
The little noise is complemented
by the vast emptiness of the place.
I guess Tera is sort of isloated
vast emptiness of Tera is its very
beauty. I can see miles of rolling
African savannah dotted by trees
and broken by an occasional
mountain or messa.

In such surroundings, I’m in
the past, which is my present.
My colleagues have cars. But
not me. Fortunately, I couldn’t
afford a car. That would have
ruined by Tera thing, maybe?
Who knows anyway? At any rate
my only means of transportation
is my horse. I haven’t given him
a name yet. But believe it or
not, my horse is very important
to me. Imagine, a 20th century
college graduate from the U.S.A.
riding a horse into town at sun-
set. To an American it sounds
very romantic; it’s my way of
life.

A new way of life. Jesus Christ,
I just realized that maybe I am
no longer living in the 20th cen-
tury. I wake up each morning to
eat breakfast and teach school.
At noon. I write until about
1:00, when lunch is served. And
since I have no language classes
to teach in the afternoon, I usually
get in some extra sleep. That's
one of my aims in Africa —- get
planty of sleep.

However, I usually find time
between 4:30 and 6:00 to do some
writing or reading. But at six. I
venture outside. Its cooler now;
the sun is bearable. and I mount
my horse and go riding in some
new direction. There are some
herds of wild horses and gazelle
around Tera. I haven’t seen them

yet, but I have seen Giraffe and
even Hippos in the Niger River.

But since I really don’t like rid-
ing in the ark, I return to the com-
pound around 7 (in the tropics
there are no seasonal variations
in the length of a day. The sun
comes up at 7 a.m. in Tera, and
it falls at 7 p.m.) I dismount
and feed my horse, a large brown
bale of 7 years, and make my
way to the dinner table. We talk
and laugh and light up our
Petromax lamp.

After dinner we move over to our
outdoor salon (we eat outdoors al-
ways) where we shoot the shit
until about ten. Then we go to
sleep under the stars. 4

But going to sleep under the
stars is quite different in Tera.
Except for two buildings (not in-
cluding the school compound)
there is no electricity. Thus it is
very dark in the evening. And the
sky is magnificent. One can al-
ways see meteors falling and the
Milkyway stretching like a wide
cotton belt from the southern sky
to the north. My first night in
Tera, I looked at that sky for
hours. It was the first time I had
seen the real Milky Way.

Maybe it is far fetched to say
that I’m not living in the 20th
century. After all there are two
autos on the compound and there
are facilities for electricity. We
have gas refrigerators. But that
isn’t important.

The thing that is important is
that I feel like I’m living in the
past which is my present. I feel
good and relaxed. I don’t worry
about problems. Perhaps I have
adopted a fatalistic attitude.
Perhaps I just don’t give a damn
about anything except my friends.
my horse, and my students. I
can’t be bothered with anything
else. As the French say: “C’est
pas le peine_" It‘s not
worth the trouble.

When I return to the US. I
will not live in the past. But I
hope to retain just one thing: My
relaxed "devil may care" atti-
tude toward life. It‘s the only
way to maintain your sanity in
the damn rat race over there in
the U.S.A.

Someone's cutting the umbilical
cord.

Editor, The Pitt News,

Dear Dave,‘ (the one Miss
Joyce wrote about on Page 4
of Wednesday’s Pitt News),

man, I don’t know what to say.
I’ve been a “Radical Political
Man” for the last Four Years,
since 11th grade in High School.
I’ve come from the beatings
and taunts of my classmates

then, to your story. I’ve lain in -

the streets puking up my guts
from gas, or cried in the hell
of having a friend beaten to
death, or smiling somehow in
Washington as I stood on duty
by the coffins and later by
the sneakers stand. Some of the
placards had names of relatives
or friends, and I had to tear
the string off that name.

I feel strange . . . I’ve done
the resistance thing as far as I
can to date, I’ve counselled
countless guys, given money,
been willing to go to jail for
a year, or to leave, but now,
what the fuck can I do?

You’re- number three, so am

Why Flags
Or University
Vehicles?

Editor, The Pitt News,

I guess its catching, or is it
birds of a feather? But now I
see the University Police with
American flags 'on University
Owned Vehicles. Have they
taken a cue from the Local
Pittsburgh Pigs?

I have always for some reason
kept the University Police separ-
ate in my mind because they, in
performing their duty, don’t kick
you and call you-creep. I even
think there is some sort of strange
rapport. University Police—why
all of a sudden American flags on
University owned police vehicles.

I would like, at this point,
to make a suggestion, since I
feel the flags are in fact a sign
for supporting the President.
On The War Issue. If you would
like to have American flags on
Police vehicles why not have
Half American flags and on the
other half of the vehicles fly
Viet Cong Flags. I mean equal
time is the American way.

CAGERS ON THE AIR

For the first time since the
days of All-American Don Hen-
non, the Panthers will have the
complete basketball schedule,
both home and away, broadcast
over radio.

Station WTAE (1220) in
Pittsburgh will carry the com-
plete schedule. Bill Hillgrove,
evening radio and sports per-
sonality at WTAE, will handle
the play-by-play.

In addition to the WTAE
broadcasts, campus radio sta-
tion WPGH will also handle
live play-by-play of the cager
contests. Sports director John
Jenchura will be at the mike.

Editor, The Pitt News,

In answer to Bob Ging’s arti-
cle “Waiting in Bureaucratic
Lines,” I would like to give the
students another view of this
process of registering. I would
also like to defend the girls who
“powder their noses, and run,
out for lunch.” I assume we are
not supposed to takes breaks or
lunch hour now? The Office of
the Registrar is opened through
noontime for the students" con-
vemence.

Perhaps it would be a good
idea to offer a course in Uni-
versity processes. If the students
understood the entire process of
registering they would not have
nearly as many problems as ex-
pressed in the referred to article.
Many incorrect invoices are due
to students who register twice
for one term, register on an
add and drop slip, improperly
fill out the registration, or sub-
mit so many add and drop forms
that they can expect only to com-
plicate their registration pro-
cess. The majority of students.
I believe, just don’t take the
time to follow directions.

From past experience and
knowledge, I know of several
students who had the general
attitude that the employees of
Student Records don’t work, but
after these students got part-
time jobs in the same office
they appreciated the tremendous
amount of work put out by an
average of 15 full-time regis-
tration employees for about
20,000 student registrations.

Bob Ging mentions irony in
speaking of the inefficiency of
the University. Something which
I feel to be ironic is that the
present policy of “instant wait-
ing” was not the choice of the ad-
ministrators or the staff. This
process was voted on by Student
Government. The results showed
1306 votes for the present process.
Only 215 were not in favor.

Jewish Studies

Demand Time

Editor, The Pitt News,

Many students have expres-
sed an interest in a Jewish Stud-
ies Department. Unfortunately,
the administration appears un-
willing to even discuss this
matter seriously. Why?

There are faculty members
who want to teach in it. Isn‘t
this a sufficient reason to have
such a program?

Especially, if one believes that
the University is a part of. and
has responsibilities to. all the
members of the surrounding
community? '

Could we have some answers‘?

I realize that the students com-
plain about standing in line for
as long as an hour. but some of
the girls in our office are on
their feet eight hours a day. You

may argue that we are being.

paid for this inconvenience,
however, I wish you could exam-
ine the figures for the starting
salaries of full-time employees
as clerks or secretaries at the
University or any other non-
profit organization.

Classes are not closed because
the Registrar’s Office wants it
this way.iThe individual depart-
ments determine the number
of places issued for each class
and they cannot make it an un-
determined number because of
the limited number of instructors
and classroom space. The advis-
ors, incidentally, have closed
section listings.

If the students who came into
the Registrar’s Office or any
other office of the University
are courteous, cooperative, and
patient, they can then expect
the same treatment in return.

Vulgarity p

Editor. The Pitt News,

In the October 20th issue of
The Pitt News there is an edi-
torial entitled "The Run Around.”

There is no question that you
have the right to criticize but
I question the matter of good
taste and high University stand-
ards when you resort to obscen-
ity and profanity in referring
to the president of our Board,
Mr. William H. Rea.

I hope it is not too late for
you to learn that vulgarity

Registers Gripe Martyrs 0

Editor, The Pitt News,

I am a full—time student, and
a part—time employee of the
Registrar’s Office, and therefore
I think I am able to give a
more valid account of the situa-
tion in the Registrar’s Office
than Mr. Robert Ging. I am
sure a lot of students do not
realize the tremendous amount
of work that is handled by this
office.

The Registrar’s ‘Office han-
dles just about every phase of
the actual administration and re-
cording of a student’s academ-
ic work. Master records are
typed-up for each incoming stu-
dent, and if there is ever any
change in the name and address
on this transcript, it is taken
care of through this office. The
course-time schedule is made
up here, in addition to all room
assignments and changes. Then
comes registration. For this
particular winter registration,
there were 15 girls to handle
approximately 20,000 students’
registrations, and they complet-
ed an average of 734 registra-
tions per day! !

Of course there are mistakes
made, but often many of these
stem from a variety of other
offices in the University, rang-
ing from the professors to the
carelessness of students them-
selves. For instance, one par-
ticular student spelled his
name backwards on an infor-
mation card, and another stu-
dent, in the space marked
“person to be notified in case
of emergency” wrote Winston
Churchill. Don’t you think there
is serious thinking to be done
by some students too‘???

It is just incidents like these
that are more often the cause
for time being wasted than is
the “nose powdering” of our
office girls.

And so, fellow students,_ as
you stand in that long line,
waiting to get closed out of
your courses (which, by the
way, the Registrar’s Office has
no control over since Student
Government voted to keep the
present system of “waiting in
bureaucratic lines” rather than
adopt a new system, and since
each department dictates the
number of class cards to be cut
for each course), ask yourself
once or twice how many times
you have called on the Regis-
trar’s ‘Office for any of the
above-mentioned services, and
then realize how many times
these services are done correctly,
and on time.

dent groups who are inter-

'Revolution

Now’
Not Logical  

Editor, The Pitt News,

In his article of Wednesday,
October 22, “Gonna Be A Revo-
lution,” Staff Writer Bob Ging
alludes to the fact that the era
of non-violence is at an end, and
the next logical step is revolu-_
tion. This may in fact be true;

but one must exercise caution .

in considering the term “revo-
lution.”

The fate of McCarthy and
Kennedy is indeed unfortunate,
but to give up, and resort to

revolution because of it is ad?

mitting to the “loss of the battle,
and also the war.”

However, if one is convinced

that some type of revolution is
the only recourse, one should

be wary of those who seek to

overthrow and tear down, but
fail to provide a viable recon-
struction program. It serves no
purpose to tear down and not
rebuild. Social progress is a de-
sirable goal, but revolution for
the sake of revolution is not.

To Paul Stoller’s View

IQHHHKIHPEHHFEPEKZICPZHUHUPEHEEIHF

Editor, Pitt News:

Paul Stoller‘s article “Reflec-
tion on Africa” (Nov. 24) must not
be left unanswered. As an African
(not an exchange student), I find
it particularly disturbing as it is
a calculated writing to emphasize
the old myth about all Africa. I
can now understand the reason for
the great misconceptions about
Africa. In this age when the true
facts about Africa (present day)
are just coming to light, Paul Stol-
ler is trying to turn the clock
backwards.

In the first place, his Pan Amer-
ican plane did not drop him in that
little village. He must have seen
the modern cities of these coun-
tries that are no different from
Pittsburgh except that you prob-
,ably do not face the danger of be-
ing shot as happened to a Campus
policeman sometime ago. He may
be living without electricity in
that hamlet but that is different

from making it look as if all parts
of Africa have no electricity.

The mosquitoes may be twice
that of Pittsburgh but Paul should
have gone to see the mosquitoes
in the Mississippi Delta of his
country and he will know that the
mosquitoes over there in Tera are
not twice the size of mosquitoes in
the United States. He could be-
come nautions. experience violent
“run" stop sweating and die. I
could in this terrible winter, catch
cold, have pneumonia. stop
breathing and die.

Let me hasten to add that I do
not dispute his findings. but in any
country in this world. you can al-
ways flip the coin and look only at
the bad side —— gun murder. homo-
sexuals, rate of divorce. drug,

beries, cancer, heart attack, etc..

How Our Readers See It

 

C lass

Politics

(Editor's Note: The following
memo was sent to all faculty,
part-time personnel, teaching as-
sistants and teaching fellows on
November II. The author is Dr.
Barbara Sargent, Acting Chair-
man of French Dept.)

This is. fortunately for us, a
free country. Private citizens may
make their views known in any
way that does not violate Federal
and local laws. On the other hand,
citizens who are members of an
academic community are in a
rather special situation, for what
they say and do may exert more
influence than the words and acts
of other people.

It is my View (and Dr. Phil-
lip Koch concure in this) that any
effort made in the classroom to
sway students views one way or
the other on political subjects is
an abuse of the privileged posi-
tion a teacher occupies. This ap-
plies both to direct verbal expres-
sion and to such indirect but high-
ly expressive means as the wear-
ing of propaganda buttons, arm-
bands, and the like. Whatever
members of the academy choose
to do when they are not teaching
their academic subjects, such to-
kens of sentiment are highly un-
suitable when one is functioning
formally as an instructor.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The following memo came into
my hands, by sheer coincidence,
recently. (see memo to right). No-
tably, the memo is addressed to
all teachers including, I assume,
full time tentured faculty. Miss
Sargent is presently acting chair-
man of the French Department so
this memo is not simply the whim
of an individual faculty mem-
her, but actually departmental
policy.

If nothing else, I find a true
affront to the intelligence of
students in t is memo. Does Dr.

Sargent think we take our poli-
tical cues from the political
positions of faculty? If that were
true, I think the political tenor on
campus would be markedly dif-
ferent from what it is.

_ If students are as gullible as she
suggests, it would seem that each
faculty member would have to
refrain from “pushing” his own

discipline or approach to that di-
scipline, since that too is a form
of propagandizing, (or is it pos-
sible that there is an academic
“party line” one can subscribe to)
albiet in an academic sense.

Not only does this kind of poll-
cy deprive faculty of their right
to express their views publicly,
and their academic freedom to run
their class as they see fit, but it
points up the unnatural distic-
tion between “academic subjects"
and life. which causes many stu-
dents to call their education ir-
relevant.

I do not know whether this
policy is to be enforced; if it is,
it augurs ill for academic free-
dom within the university. If it
islallowed to pass unnoticed by
the faculty as a whole it stands as
a glaring suspension of some in-
dividuals’ civil liberties.

If the premise in Dr. Sargent’s
first sentence is true, one does not
discard his civil liberties when one
enters a classroom. Furthermore,
it is not inconceivable that this
policy. if tolerated. can escalate
to include dress codes and hair
styles; in fact, I hear that such
an escalation has already begun.

Editor, The Pitt News

INTRODUCTION

One could not possibly attempt
to look at the mass media in 1969
without mentioning some of the re-
cent questions raised by Vice-
President Agnew in his speech of
Nov. 13.

Although Mr. Agnew limited his
criticism to television news, there
are points to be made about his re-
marks with respect to newspapers
as well.

A reaction to Agnew’s speech
which most closely resembles
mine is one of Lester Bernstein,
managing editor of Newsweek.
Mr. Bernstein says in his re-
marks of Nov. 24 Newsweek,
“What disturbed me at first was
that, though it was the wrong man
saying the wrong things, he was
partly right. As a somewhat critic
of TV news, I wish he would get
off my side.”

Mr. Bernstein continues, “Bur-
ied in Agnew’s simplistic distor-
tions and self-serving rhetoric
is a nugget of truth: a relative
handful of TV newsmen wield vast
influence as the stewards of the
most vivid and powerful medium
in the land. They are elected by
no one; their qualifications are
not always a matter of public ex-
amination; indeed those who func-
tion behind the camera are face-
less men to a public whose view
of the world they help to shape. Is
there any better way to operate
TV news in a free society? Do the
wielders of this great power meas-
ure up to their responsibilities?
And if they fall short, how can
they be brought up to the mark?”

Mr. Bernstein goes on to explain
why he felt the Vice-President was
unqualified to deliver such a
speech, and the remark which I
mention here lends itself to the

subject of my look at the mass
media. Mr. Bernstein says, "The
timing and background of his
speech lend clout to the cudgel. It
was crafted and approved in the
White House and scheduled has-
tily to be given on the «eve of an-
tiwar demonstrations that TV
newsmen, according to the speech
itself, “can make or break.”

Mr. Agnrew is right when he
says that a handful of anchor men
decide the news Americans will
see. But why did he wait until such
a crucial moment in American
history to explain this to the na-
tion (on national TV no less)?
Surely he doesn’t feel his insights
will change the tone of the news,
just because the TV commenta-
tors have offered more criticism
of Nixon and his policies than any
president in the past years. But,
the “why’s” of his speech are not
quite as important as what Mr.
Bernstein calls “the nugget of
truth.”

That “nugget of truth” is the
fact that a few men decide the
news for millions of Americans.
More often than not, the news that
is presented to viewers of TV and
readers of newspapers is distort-
ed by those men. Their opinions,
be they personal or professional,
in the form of editing, rob the
viewers or reader of the whole
story. The mass media is, as Ag-
new says, biased. The only way a
newspaper can see both sides of a
certain issue is to read biased ac-
counts in two or more newspapers
—-one which is on the “pro” side
of the issue, and one which is on
the “con” side.

This paper will attempt to show
how different a news event can be
reported. Since it is much too dif-
ficult to compare two TV net-
works (something Mr. Agnew
bypassed in favor of lumping all
three networks together), this pa-

per will study newspaper cover-
age of the Vietnam Moratorium
in Washington, D. C., on Nov. 13,
14, and 15. By showing the differ-
ences in coverage between two
Washington papers and The Pitts-
burgh Press, I will attempt to
point out how editors can actually
alter the news by omitting, adding
or slanting certain aspects of a
news story.

The three day Moratorium in
Washington was highlighted by a
“March Against Death,” which
began at 5:45 p.m. Thursday. Nov.
13. Both the Pittsburgh Press and
the Evening Star (one of Washing-
ton’s three evening newspapers)
gave top billing to the Moratori-
um. The aspects of the event that
the two papers chose to play up on
their front pages is significant.

Under the eight column banner
headline “Viet Marchers Pour
into D. 0,’? the Press had three
smaller headlines and three sep-
arate stories. Under the first sub-
head, “Hanoi with Protestors,
Wanted or Not,” which covered
five columns, the Press carried a
Scripps-Howard syndicated story
from Saigon which began, “Saigon
—Communist troops apparently
are preparing to “support” anti-
war demonstrations in the U.S.
with an offensive of their own in
Vietnam.”

The other two Press stories un-
der the banner headline were both
introduced with three line, one
column headlines. The first story
explained the objectives, plans,
and details of the three day Mora-
torium, with emphasis on security
forces such as National Guards-
men and 9,000 Army and Marine
troops trained in handling civil
disturbances. The second story
under the headline, “GIs Suffer
Heavy Toll at DMZ” explained
that the U.S. suffered its heaviest
losses in two months. The fourth

The Media Is Biased’--Agnew

paragraph of the story says, “The
fighting in South Vietnam’s north-
ern sector came on the eve of anti
war protests in the U.S. Captured
guerrilla documents indicated
widespread attacks were ordered
to coincide with these demonstra-
tions.”

A similar account of the Com-
munist offensive appeared on page
three of Thursday’s Evening Star,
under the headline (two columns)
“11 Gls Slain at DMZ in Big Red
Attack.” In this account, there
was no mention of the anti-war
demonstrations, and the tenth
paragraph of the story noted,  . .
a spokesman for U.S. command
termed the attack yesterday af-
ternoon below the demilitarized
zone ‘an isolated action.’ ‘It is
something to watch,’ he added,
‘but as of now we couldn’t attach
any significance to it.”’

Page one of the Evening Star
carried an eight column banner
headline, “200 Arrested in Penta-
gon Mass,” with a subhead,
“‘Peace’ Ritual Is Ended with No
Violence” introducing the main
story. A story about the three day
plans of the Moratorium appear-
ed over three columns under a pic-
ture from the ‘Peace Mass,’ and
the story which received top bill-
ing in the Press, appeared under
the one column headline, “Hanoi
Claims Protests Will Shorten
War.” This story began, “Paris
(AP)-—North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong made plain today that
they are counting on growing pro-
tests in the United States to speed
the end of the war on their terms.”

Although many factors must en-
ter into the difference in cover-
age, such as the fact that the Mor-
atorium was a local, as well as
national story in D. C., the editors
of the Press seemed to “play up”
the very aspects of the Moratori-
um which the Evening Star play-
ed down.

Bot papers use page one banner
headlines, but the Press seems to
use its banner head to draw the
readers’ attention to such things
as the alleged tie in of the Mora-
torium with Hanoi and GI deaths
in the DMZ. The Evening Star ac-
cents the arrests, yet peaceful ac-
tions, during the Mass in the Pen-
tagon as a part of what will be
three days of activities. Nowhere
in the Star’s story about the plans
of the Moratorium is their mention
of National Guardsmen or Army
and Marine troops. The Star said
the mood in Washington on Thurs-
day afternoon was “harmonious,”
while the Press led its readers to
believe that the troops were call-
ed in because Washington was ex-
pecting anything but peace.

One of the reasons the Press is
wont to distort the news, not only‘
of the Moratorium, but of other
controversial events as well, is
that it is a part of the Scripps
Howard string of newspapers, and
must use syndicated stories and

columns as a part of that syndi--

cate. For example, their lead
story about the alleged tie in of the
Moratorium with Hanoi, is a
Scripps-Howard story. Newspa-
pers in the Scripps-Howard chain
are traditionally conservative,
sometimes even bordering on the
reactionary side of the political
spectrum.

Another way in which the Press,
and other papers as well, can dis-
tort or bias the news was very evi-
dent in both Thursday’s and Sun-
day (Nov. l6)’s issues. The Asso-
ciated Press or United Press In-
ternational send long stories to
the individual papers, and editors
may edit the stories, using only
those paragraphs or sentences
that they see fit. Thus, the news
becomes distorted, as was evident
in Sunday’s Press.

While the Washington Post,
Evening Star, and Washington
Daily News all covered the March
Against Death, the skirmish at
DuPont Circle and the mass rally
at the Washington Monument with
numerous stories, pictures, quotes
and headlines — thus presenting
the violence with the peace, the
huge throng in pictures—the Press,
again using a front page banner
headline to attract the readers’ at-

tention, presented the varied ac- ,

tion in one story, 27 paragraphs
long with three pictures.

As was pointed out in the Wash-
ington papers, the peaceful week-

Biased Media

[Continued from-Page 9)

end was marred by two\isolated
incidents involving violence. All
three Washington papers, even
the Daily News, which is a mem-
ber of the Scripps-Howard chain,

’ presented pictures of the mass of

people, of the violence, of the
marching, of the interesting side-
lights of 330,000 people living in a
strangecity for three days. All
had interviews with parents, stu-
dents, leaders, followers, police-
men, city officials; all seemed to
present all aspects of the week-
end.

The Press offered its readers a

’ story that was biased by its very

content. Of the 27 paragraphs in
the story, 10 dealt either directly
or indirectly with the subject of
Violence. The three pictures show-
ed a large group of people with a
Viet Cong flag; Senators Charles

« Goodell and George McGovern
‘ walking with Mrs. Loretta King;

and “Radical Students scuffling

lwith marshals along the parade

route.” Not one picture of the
crowd at the Monument; not one
story of the personal-interest-side
of the March or weekend; not one
quote from a policeman,” city offi-
cial, march leader or follower;
not one.

So, the picture of the weekend

. in Washington was presented to

the readers in Pittsburgh in a bi-
ased and slanted way. By taking
those parts of a UPI story that
said what they wanted to say
about the weekend, the editor (or
editors) of the Press presented a
picture of the weekend that by
mere numbers of words, indicated
to the reader that it was almost as

7 violent as it was peaceful.

It is not mere coincidence that
the Press happened to pick 10 out
of 27 paragraphs that dealt with
violence to present to itsreaders.
All week before the Moratorium
weekend, the Press played up the
possibilities of violence. The ban-

ner headline of the Wednesday‘

Press noted the movement of 9,-

' 000 troops to D. C. for the week-

end. Thursday’s front page was

6 explained above.

It seems the Press clearly

wanted to present a slanted view

of the Moratorium, and succeed-
ed. One example of how they could
have at least attempted to present

the other side of the two minor
violent incidents was a Scripps-
Howard story that appeared on
page three of Sunday’s Daily
News. The story was written by a
reporter who was arrested near
DuPont Circle, scene of violent
tear gas battles between police-
men and protestors Friday night,
while he was looking for a Greek
friend who had walked near the
Circle looking for a show that
sold Greek newspapers.

This story told of-the maltreat-
ment of innocent bystanders by
the police, and was syndicated by
Scripps-Howard. Surely the Press
could have had access to this
story, had they desired to present
the other side of the violent story.

But this is just one example.
The Press could have used a wider
variety of pictures; interviews; a
few scattered quotes; even by giv-
ing more space in their large Sun-
day paper would have allowed for
a more objective look at the week-
end happenings. One can only feel
that their small, distorted story
proved that they had hoped for a
violent weekend, and when it did-
n’t occur, they salvaged what vio-
lent-related information they
could, and neglected the rest of
story.

CONCLUSION

I happened to have been in
Washington from Thursday, Nov.
13, until Sunday, Nov. 16. The
entire story of the Moratorium is
a story of people, young and old,
liberal and conservative, peaceful
and violent. It is a story that is
hard to tell objectively —— either
by those whomarched, watched,
reported or in any way lived
through it. It is a story of hun-
dreds of thousands of people do-
ing something, each in his own
way, that he or she doesn’t do in
the normal course of his or her
life. The papers in Washington at-
tempted to tell the story of the
Moratorium from all sides. Al-
though one paper may have play-
ed up the violence more than the
others, it attempted to stress the
overall_peacefulness of the week-
end and its effect on the Presi-
dent, the Capital, and the Nation
(not to mention millions of inter-

-ested people around the world).

But, the Pittsburgh Press made
no attempt to report all the facets

of the Moratorium. It had an an-
gle from the very beginning of its
coverage of the weekend’s events,
and it stuck to that angle even
though it had to distort, edit and
manipulate the facts to do so.

This distortion of the news is
the nugget of truth that Mr. Bern-
stein and I find in Agnew’s speech.
A small group of editors of the
Pittsburgh Press have the power
to distort the news that will effect
the views of its readers. This to
me seems to be the major flaw in.
mass media today. Ionly hope this
paper has proven that distortion.
though editing, layout, omission
as well as commission, is very
much a part of the mass media to-
day.

The Lottery

by ROBERT L. JAcoBsoN
Washington

A newly authorized draft lottery
is scheduled to begin next month.
For college students and other
draft-eligible young men, its
chief significance is that it will
give them a better indication than
they have had in the past of their

eventual chances of being draft-.

ed. Following are some questions
and answers about the lottery.

— How will the lottery work?

In 1970, the primary pool of
draft-eligible men will consist
of all those who were between
the ages of 19 and 26 in the
1969 calendar year. In 1971, and
each subsequent year, only
those who became 19 in the pre-
ceeding year will be liable.

The order in which men in
the pool are chosen for military
service will be determined at
random by their birth dates
and’ will be announced in ad-
vance for each year. It will be
based on the sequence in which
all the dates of the year are
selected by lot.

Each date, including Feb. 29
of leap years, will be given a
number from 1 to 366. Men in
the designated pool will be sub-
ject to monthly draft calls in
the order that their numbers
come up in the sequence.

All men will receive ii their
lottery numbers only once-in
the year in which they reach
the designated age for the pri-
mary pool, which is known as
the “prime age group.”

— What happens if there are
more men with the same lot-
tery number than need to be
drafted in a given month?

A man will be drafted in the
order that the first letter of his
last name corresponds to a pre-
determined, random sequence
for the 26 letters of the alpha-
bet.

The result will vary, however,
since each of the country’s
4,098 local draft boards has a
different total of registrants and
a different monthly quota.

—— What does a man’s lottery
number tell him about the
likelihood of his being draft-
ed?

In the final analysis, the ef-
fect of the lottery will be deter-
mined largely by the size of
draft calls in relation to the
total pool of men who meet the
military’s standards.

Projections by the Depart-
ment of Defense place the total
pool for 1970 at about 850,000
men. About 290,000 are expected
to volunteer for active duty or
the reserves, leaving some 560,-
000 men still qualified and avail-
able for induction.

The estimated draft call for
1970, however, is for a maximum

of about 250,000 men, or about

45 per cent of the available
pool.

What this means for those in
the prime age group who are
not deferred or exempt is that
they stand about a 50-50 chance
of being drafted. '

Assuming that the relative need
for new inductees does not in-
crease in the years ahead, a
man’s lottery number will give
him a rough idea of whether-
or how fast——he is li_ke1y to be
called.

A low number in the lottery"

sequence will mean a high pro-
bability of induction, and a high
number will mean a low proba-
bility. For those with numbers
in the middle range—say from
No. 140 to No. 220—the pros-
pects will be more or less un-
certain for up to one year.

A man’s eligibility to be
drafted will last only for one
year.

— What happens to a man who.
remains in the prime age
group for a year and is not
called?

Barring a national emergency,
he will never be called.

— How will ‘the lottery affect
those, such as college students,
who have draft deferments?

The Department of Hispanic
Languages and Literatures will
offer two new courses in Winter
Tem; both will serve as alterna-
tives to the language requirement
at level four.

With the readings and class
work in English, Spanish 82 is

also available for students with‘

no previous background in the
language. ‘The purpose of the
courses is to expose the student
to a multipicity of aspects con-
cerning Latin America.

Although it will be generalized,
the course will deal with govern-
ment, economy, the Church, etc.
Latin American Culture, Span-
‘ish 82, is offered at 9 a.m. MWF
in 321 CL (code LQF) and at
4 p.m. MWF in 119 CL (code
LQH).

While both courses offer three
credits, the second one is
Spanish-based. A Spanish 58, Panor-
ama contemporaneo de la cultura
latinoamerica, is aimed to give a
general survey of all major cul-
tural characteristic of Latin Am-
erica. ‘ '

The courses differ in that one
will be conducted in English and
the other in Spanish, and in the
emphasis of the latter.

It has the additional purpose of
deepening the student’s ability
to work with the Spanish language
through the readings and class-
room discussion rather than a ser-
ies of language drills. Conversa-
tion is the byword.

Book Center Nixes Profit Hopes

(Editor's Note: On May 23,
1969 the Book Center Board of
Directors was created to operate
the facilities of the Pitt Book
Center on a cooperative basis.
Since that time, the Board of Di-
rectors has been responsible for
the management of all of the ac-
tivities of the Book Center. The
following is a statement issued at
the last Board meeting.

At their regular monthly meet-
ing, on November 25, the Board
of Directors of the Book Center
agreed that some clarification of
the prospects of profit sharing
this year is required. Apparently.
articles in the Pitt News and signs
posted in the Book Center have
created an impression on the part

of many that this year ther will
be profits which will be shared
among customers of the book
Center in amounts relative to
purchases made by each customer
— as proven by presentation of his
receipts which he has saved.
While the board of Directors is
working to operate the Book
Center at a profit, and also is
desirous of sharing profits among
customers, the Board is concerned
that customr expectations of co-
operative profit sharing may be
overly optimistic.

There are two items which the
Board feels it should consider con-
cerning sharing of profits with
customers. The first item of pri-
ority, in the opinion of the Direc-

The nickel cup of coffee has always spelled value.
And value is what McDonald’s sells.

In these inflationary times, you have to search for
value. For value is not price alone, it must also

That’s why a McDonald’s 100% pure beef sand-
wich and .a 5c cup of coffee represent true value.
With a full eight-ounce cup of coffee priced at
just 5c, these are some of the combinations you
can now enjoy at your local McDonald’s:

tors, is expansion. The Book Cen-
ter is comparatively small for a
university of this size. It is al-
ready evident that phenomenal in-

’ creases in both the number of test

titles and volume of texts which
students and faculty require to be
stocked by the Book Center cause
a space problem —— which has a
direct impact on profits.

Hard cover text books are sold
at the publishers’ suggested prices
which allows a gross margin of
twenty-per cent. But, according
to National Association of Col-
lege Stores statistics. overhead on
texts is about 26 per cent. Thus,
an increase in sales volume of
texts does not increase profits. On
the contrary, with a greater num-
ber of texts being sold, there is
less overall profit realized by the

store. As the sales volume of texts.
increases there is an increasing '

loss, and the increased volume of
texts displaces items that carry a
greater markup.

There simply is not enough
space in the present facilities to
stock non-text books and other pro-
fitable merchandise in quanti-
ties adequate to offset the every-
increasing losses incurred from
text book sales. Therefore, it is

necessary to expand. However,
expansion will require investment
of funds, and the Board must
consider the wisdom of borrowing
for such an investment. A de-
cision to expand might postpone
the prospects of profit sharing
and yet, by insuring the future of
a cooperative enterprise, be in the
best long-range interests of the
book Center's constituency.

The second item which deserves
priority is the cost of capital.
The Book Center now pays about
$30,000 annually in interest on
money borrowed to pay for in-
ventory. The elimination of this
item of overhead would provide
a much more substantial continu-
ing basis for operating economy
and greater potential profit dis-
tribution. The Board is consider-
ing ways of doing this, which in-
clude the application of a portion
of operating revenues over a per-
iod of time to build our own fund
for inventory purchases.

In view of these two priorities
it is unlikely that any profits will
be available for distrbution this
year.

The Board solicits suggestions
from its constituency concern-
ing the future operation of the
Book Center.

The Lottery

(CI;11fiIz1w(Z from Page 10‘
. /

If they were born between
Jan. 1. 1944, and Dec. 31, 1950,
they will receive a lottery num-
ber in the first drawing.

Men who are deferred will
retain their lottery numbers per-
manently and will be subject
to call over a 12-month period
when their deferments expire.
If their draft boards have al-
ready passed their lottery num-
bers at that time. they will be
drafted ahead of all others on
the list.

Selective Service statistics
show that about 1.6 million
draft-eligible college men have
student deferments.

It is not known how many of
these students will be graduat-
ing next June, but the Pentagon
estimates that about 350,000 in
the 1970 pool will have lost de-
ferments. One official says that
“most” of the men in that cate-
gory are now college students.

Nevertheless, it is a fair assump-
tion that by the start of the 1970-
71 academic Ytar, a substantial
number of eligible college

‘ graduates will not yet have

been drafted under the lottery

and may therefore be able to

start at least their first year of
graduatekstudy.

— What will happen to Reserve
Officers Training Corps pro-
grams once the lottery has
begun?

The number of (‘college students

who sign up for ROTC is expect-

ed to decline. Says one official
connected with a presidential
commission on an all-volunteer
armed force: (“Once the 19-
year-olds know where they are
in the order of call, and if they
are home free, there is going to
be no pressure on them to join
the reserves or the ROTC.”

— Will the lottery make it pos-
sible for graduate students
whose induction has been
postponed to escape the draft?

No. These men will be induct-
ed‘ at the end of the semester
or the academic year, as they
would have been without the
lottery.

There reportedly has been
some confusion, however, over

the meaning of‘ a recent presi- ”

dential announcement relating

., to graduate students who are

called for service during the
year.

Deferments for graduate
students in all but a few fields
were ended in February, 1968.
Until two months ago, those
satisfactorily pursuing a full-
time course. of study could have
their induction delayed to the
end of the semester.

On Oct. 1, the President an-
nounced a new National Security
Council memorandum that per-
mits extending the postpone-
ments in such cases through the
entire academic year. Students
who have not been granted this
further delay may still face

. prompt induction unless they re-

quest the extra time from their
state selective service director.

— What about graduate students
in the prime age group who
have not been called for in-
duction?

They will take their place in
the lottery sequence along with
everyone else. If they do get
called, they can request post-
ponement of induction until
the end of the academic year.

-— How will graduate school en-
rollments in general be affect-
ed?

The U. S. Office of Education i

estimates that ‘close to 800,000
full-time and part-time students

are enrolled in graduate schools
this year.

According to past surveys,
roughly half of all graduate stu-
dents have been eligible for the
draft, although in practice not
all of them have been taken
while they were still in school.

Some graduate students, for
example. have received occupa-
tional deferments from their 10-
cal boards because of teaching
or research responsibilities.

Under the lottery, less than
half of the draft-eligible grad-
uate students—that is, less than
one-fourth of all graduate stu-
dents—are likely to be called
next year.

—— Does this mean that those
with occupational deferments
who reach age 26 without be-
ing called will no longer be
vulnerable?

Probably so, although techni—_
cally they will remain subject to
the draft until age 35.

— Will there be any more induc-

tions this year?

No. President Nixon canceled
the draft calls for November
and December of 1969. The next
inductions will come under the
lottery.

—— How will those younger than
19 know about their chances
for the draft?

They will have to wait until
they enter the prime age group,
when a separate lottery for that
year will apply.

10 things

erica’s newsmall cars  
won’t talk about.

Nova talks about things
those new little cars prefer not to mention.

For instance, (1) a cargo-guard luggage compartment; (2) an extra
set of fenders inside the fenders; (3) flush and dry rocker panels that help
prevent rust and corrosion; (4) a quality built Body by Fisher; (5) Magic-Mirror acrylic
lacquer ﬁnish; (6) a ﬁrm, steady ride programmed by computer-selected springs;

(7) six different engines and ﬁve transmissions available; (8) an available lighting group that
even includes a monitor for your windshield washer ﬂuid; (9) radios you can order,
with antennas built right into the windshield and (10) the availability of a new, more compact
radio/stereo tape system. Americas little cars don’t offer them. Nova does.

Nova also has a very appealing price.‘And a lot of loyal friends.»

Musical. (lometly

"1 Do! I Do!”

’‘‘I Do! I Do!,” the musical
comedy that has been called a
happy paean to the institution
of marriage, will be brought to
the Nixon Theatre on December
11 by David Merrick, who orig-
inally produced the show for its
two-season-long successes on
Broadway — 584 performances,
from December 1966 to June
1968.

Phil Ford and Mimi Hines,
recently seen together in “Fun-
ny Girl” in New York and in
numerous TV and night-club

comedy‘ roles across the country,
will be the stars of this tuneful
chronicle of a couple’s life to-
gether, from their wedding
night to their fiftieth anniver-
sary.

The show received acclaim
from critics and audiences when
Mary Martin and Robert Pres-
ton first appeared in New York,
and later in the show’s first na-
tional tour, as the married pair
now to be portrayed by Mr.
Ford and Miss Hines. Not the
smallest trace of “black comedy”

weekend, the University’s Wil-
liam Pitt Debating. Union re-

more from Cleveland, outdebated

nament. The team of McDon-
ald and Rudin was the only
‘undefeated one and brought the
‘Duquesne Traveling Trophy
back to Pitt for the first time
since 1958.

The Tri-Rivers Tournament,
which was open to all colleges
and universities within a mile
radius of Pittsburgh, was held
at Point Park College on No-
vember 15. The University,
acquiring ten team points, re-
ceived a trophy for placing
second overall, with Marc and
Leonard Rabinowitz placing
first in the bridge tournament
and Ray Yue, Russ Wyatt and
Bob Wilson placing fourth,
fifth and sixth respectively in
ping pont.

Bill Hughes took third place
in the chess tournament, and
the bowling team of Chris Fite,
George Sembert, Ray Lim, Dan
Lucas, and John Domin placed
second. The local competition
on the University’s campus, held

the Tri-Rivers Tournament, was
sponsored in October by the
Student Union Social Committee.

teams from across the nation
were in attendance, were Nick
DiMuria, freshman from Phoenix,
Arizona and Al Wynn, fresh-
man from Landover, Maryland.
DiMuria and Wynn advanced
undefeated through the six
preliminary rounds, and in the
“sudden death” elimination
contests, they won three vic-
tories, gaining a berth in the
final found. There they lost to
MacCalister College and re-
turned home with a second
place finish. Charles Camic and
Virginia Cook, both freshmen
from Pittsburgh, also debated
at Wichita and won four of
their six debates.

WPDU also had two teams
entered in the Wake Forest
University Dixie Classic. Jack
Kennedy from Pittsburgh and
Gene Stoker from Nashville
won five of their eight debates.
John Strand of Cleveland and
Jim Kearney from Falls Church,
Virginia returned with an iden-
tical record.

second annual Cross Exam-
ination Tournament.

ber 6th and is open to the
public. Tournament head-

quarters will be room G-8

be obtained there.

  

At Nixon

or “theatre of the absurd” could
be found in this heartwarming
musical about the joys, and some
of the tribulations, of a 50-year-
long marriage.

Written by Harvey Schmidt
and Tom Jones (creators of that
longest-running musical in Amer-
ican stage history, “The Fanta-
sticks,” now in the tenth year
of its New York run, and still
going strong) “I Do! I Do!”
was originally directed by
Gower Champion. Lucia Victor,
who was Mr. Champion's assis-
tant on that first production,
has staged the Ford-Hines pro-
duction that is coming here as
part of a coast-to-coast tour,
with the Broadway production’s
scenery and costumes that were
designed respectively by Oliver
Smith and Freddy Wittop.

This warm-hearted, song-
spreckled view of the brighter
side of matrimony was described
by Richard Watts, Jr., critic of
the New York Post, as “a sheer
delight, a continuous pleasure.”
John Chapman of the ‘N. Y.
Daily News described it as
“charming and disarming.”

At the Nixon Theatre it will
be presented for 12 performances
only.

Canadian Duo,
Tom Paxton,

Present

Ian and Sylvia, the Canadian-
American folk duo, and Tom
Paxton, a combination protest
and romantic song writer, will
appear in concert at the Car-
negie Music Hall ‘January 9,
1970. The performance begins
at 8:30. Tickets are now on sale
at the Union Ticket Office at
$4.00 per couple and $2.50 per
single ticket.

Ian and Sylvia’s distinctive
approach to modern folk‘ songs
shines in their compositions of
“Four Strong Winds,” “Loving
Sound.” and “So Much for
Music.” Their style is an inter-
play of harmony and rhythm,
and they make use of both vocal
and instrumental arrangements.
Their compositions are influenc-
ed by Ian’s intrigue with the
Canadian landscape and its
loneliness and by Sylvia’s love
of Negro gospel and blues. In
concert they combine their own
work with songs in many dif-
ferent folk idioms to form a
unique variation.

The hit tunes “Bottle of Wine”,
done by the Fireballs, and “The
Last Thing On My Mind,” a
country tune done by Porter
Wagoner and Dolly Parton were
both written by Tom Paxton.

Concert  

But, there is another side to
Tom Paxton’s works—that of
satiric bite and honest state-
ment.

Paxton shows his disappoint-
ment with the status quo in his
protest songs which ‘include
“Lyndon Johnson Told the Na-
tion”, “What Did You Learn in
School Today,” and “I Read it
in the Daily News.”

Paxton attended Drama School
at the University of Oklahoma,
served with the Army at Fort
Dix, and has performed at the
Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich
Village. Now concerned with
creativity, he is writing the
music and lyrics for a drama-
tization of the life of Henry
David Thoreau, and is working
on an American folk opera and
a novel. Paxton still writes and
records regularly.

When Buzz Ridl’s Panthers host the Miami Hurricanes in
the second game of tonight’s Steel Bowl doubleheader at the
Civic Arena most of the fans and expertswill assume that they
are watching the tournament’s battle for second place.

In this weekend’s Steel Bowl basketball tournament, three
clubs (Coach Ridl’s hoopsters, Miami U. of Florida, and Mar-
shall College of West Virginia) will put forth a determined
effort to knock down the kingpin, Duquesne University.

Duquesne hasn’t received top billing haphazardly, though. Sports

"‘And the fans were close and

"We played seriously —— I mean
fairly close to what we should —
after the first ten minutes against

, The Jungle Cats lost to Rut-

plenty of action. He didn’t start
against Rutgers because of an

minutes and contributed eleven
points.

,“He missed two weeks prac-

Grgurich Silent Again

Tim Grgurich and Gus Krop have been work-

Grgurich missed a shot at coaching Edwards.
but he has handled the rest of Buzz Ridl’s round-
ballers. Last year the ex-Panther coached a frosh
squad that was rated as one of the best Cub edi-

improvement from the varsity this winter.

Grgurich has to be needled into saying as much as

Meanwhile, the Thundering

their rivals the image of a thun-

front the enemy offense.

“We use a multiple defense, a

Matmen Set For Michi

PAUL ALLEN
Lone Senior

by MIKE MILLER
Staff Sports Writer

The matmen will launch there 1969-70 season by picking
up the gauntlets of Michigan and Eastern Michigan tomor-

TOW.

Michigan, rated seventh in the country, has frustrated the
grapplers in their two previous encounters over the past

two seasons.

Michigan has a host of six re-
turning lettermen, two of whom
were big ten champions last
year. They have good depth in the
lower weights and good sopho-
mores as well.

Wrestling coach Dave Adams
considers Michigan to be super-
ior in strength but believes his
squad stands an even chance with
Eastern Michigan.

'Y0lrng’ Army to Test
Gyrnmrsts In Opener

Special to the Pitt News
At two o’clock tomorrow afternoon, Warren Neiger’s gymnas
tics team plays host to Army in the season opener.

Army will bring young talent to Pittsburgh tomorrow, having lost
their top performers from last season; They are presently being
coached by a former University graduate. a fact which will add

flavor to the meet.

Coach Neiger ‘has six return-
ing varsity men and five new
competitors. Lowell Meek, Dave
Andrew and Ron Ludwig will
open the meet with one of the
team’s outstanding events, floor
exercise. Meek earned fifth place
in Eastern competition last year.

The second event, side horse,
another strong event for the
gymnasts, will be led by Joe
Gracik, former PIAA champion-
and national Sokol Champion.
Phil Lilly and Mike Beatty will
round out the event.

A strong ring team consists of
Jim Bilec, last year’s MVP,
Steve Weiss, Hoy Wong and Mike
Matthews. A

All the above performers will

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

also compete in the events of the
second half with the addition of
Gordon Conn who will work the
parallel bars and long horse vault.
The gymnasts are considered to
be weaker in the last three events,
long horse, parallel bars and hori-

zontal bar, and will have to score
in the first half if they want to
win.

Army beat the gymnasts last
year, but Meek is confident of a
win tomorrow. “Lase year most of
their outstanding individuals were
seniors, he explained, “so it’s
hard to say what kind of a team
they have. They’re not to be real
strong.”

Meek has been hit by a mild
case of mononucleosis, but he

should be okay for tomorrow’s bat-
tle with Army.

Eastern Michigan has eight re-

ished third in the Ohio State
Quandrangular behind the Pan-
thers and Ohio State last year.

Adams plans no special strate-
gy for tomorrow’s doubleheader.
“We’re going to try to take the
match to them and wrestle aggres-
sively,” he declared.

The Panther squad battling
Michigan includes four fresh-
men, four sophomores, three jun-
iors and one senior.

The lower weight classes con-
sist mostly of freshmen. Steve
Weiss, wrestling at 118, was a
New York state champion and a
member of the First World Greco
Team in high school.

Randy Payne, at 126, was a two
time New York state champion.
He lost only one match in his

year’s varsity.

Veteran Bob Kuhn, who was 6-3
last vear, will wrestle at 167.
Kuhn was fourth in the Easterns
last year.

Either Willie Saloky or Paul
Allen will wrestle in the 177
class. Allen was 5-4-1 last sea-
son, while Saloky was undefeat-
ed as a freshman.

The 191 class is also a toss-up
between freshman Craig Tritch
and Dave Young, a sophomore.
One will wrestle at 191 and the
other will wrestle heavy weight.

Young placed first in the Navy.

Plebe tournament last year.

According to Adams, the team’s
major weakness is inexperience.
“We have more depth but its hard
to evaluate the boys until we
have seen them in outside com-
petition,” reported the coach.

Coach Adams is trying to take

.advantage of his experienced

men by using them in several
weight classes. Paul Allen, who
normally wrestles at 177, will
be wrestling any where between
177 and heavy weight. Bud Smeltz
will like wise be used in the 142
to 150 weight class.

Adams considers his overall
team strength to have improved
from last year. The freshmen are
an asset. “They will make mis-
takes but they are the best we
have in those weight classes,” he
confirmed..I I

squad’s future performance be-

  Paper Panther

By Bill Nrmb
Stuff Sports Writer

Who’s tending the goal?

A paper panther, that’s who. November 18, one week
after George Plimpton spoke here at the University, a
5’51/2” figure streaked onto the soccer practice field and
took command of the goalie post.

The “wee’ individual was not a member of the soccer
squad, nor was he even a potential booter. This writer,
however, happened to be the mysterious goalie." 1

' In the aftermath of the film Paper Lion and Plimp-
§ ton’s lecture, I had been infected with the writer-turned-
 athlete bug. I decided to leap a step ahead of Plimpton
 into the feel of his next adventure — that of a goalie. (He
 will try ice hockey next.)

Soccer, a game which I never had the opportunity oo
 play, obviously required more skill than a haphazard run-
 and-kick routine. This I discovered as instantly as my foot
I macked the ball.

When I first struck the ball in the prescrimmage warm-

p, the short kick spun far left of the net. It wasn’t ex-

5; actly a jet—propelled boom. In fact, when it hit the earth

E1 the ball bumbled more tediously along the ground than

would a student headed for a Towers’ breakfast; I was
hocked by my impotency.

Shortly afterwards, I stepped in front of the goal —
ext to freshman goalie Steve Fibel. I merely glared at
ome of the smoking smashes darting towards the net.

Soon, the scrimmage started. I was the only “athlete”
on the sidelines.

Moments later, Bemis glanced down and gave me the
nod, I was terrificly excited and I ran to the net so hard
hat I must’ve dug out two or three inches of turf on every
tep.

“Steve,” I gasped, “I’m taking your place. Hey, do
you think you could stay around here and help me out?”

“If I have to handle one of John White’s shots,” I
bought, “they mightn’t know whether to throw my head
or the ball back onto the field.”

 

           

          

Meanwhile, Steve appeared busier explaining his posi-
tion than he had been playing it. And before I realized it,
the ball was only a few feet in front of the goal. '

Steve yelled, “Go out after the ball! ”

I hesitated and momentarily left the net wide open.

Fortunately the five-foot shot strayed to the right of the
half-vacant net, and my perfect record remained in tact:
no goals allowed and three saves credited. I then asked
Steve, “Doesn’t my fullback get the ball when he’s back
here near the play?” '

7)

“Not when the ball’s coming toward the net like that,
he declared.

“Normally, in a circumstance like that a team will
score easily, won’t they? I guess I was lucky.”

“Right! ‘5

 

    

Bowl Season Threatens 
To Bore Yawning Fans

Viewpoint by EVAN PATTAK
Staff Sports Writer

An orange, a tangerine. a peach. a pecan, some
sugar, the sun, and a hula. It reads like a come-on-
from a Tahitian travel agency or an exotic Poly-
nesian luau. But this tantalizing bit of tropicanna
is only a slice of the collegiate post season, a meal
that has become almost indigestable.

The melange of bowl games that begins in mid-
December should provide an exciting climax to
the college football season. The bleary-eyed ad-
dict, however, may find the distended bowl season
leading to insufferable ennui. After enduring three
months of Bud Wilkinson’s banal rendition of “Ya
Gotta Have Momentum,” the football faithful de-
serve a better fate.

A major problem of the post-season lineup is
the great proliferation of uninteresting and trivial
games. Mediocre teams too often perform in bowls
created by ambitious promoters, greedy schools, and
a belief that rabid sports fans will pay money to
watch anything that is build up enough

But just as the sport’s dollar will stretch sonly
so far _(remember the Gotham Bowl?), so will the
home viewer's patience be worn thin by overdoses
of mediocrity.

When this happens, the major bowls also begin
to lose their luster. Disgust with "too many of the
bowls can lead to‘ indifference to the sport in gen-
eral. All of the gimmicks in television’s magic bag
will have no effect, once apathy to the actual game
sets in.

Enthusiasm for the major bowls is further damp-
ened by archaic restrictions and favoritism in the

bowl selections. The system this year, along with’

the usual assortment of David and Goliath mis-
matches, has produced these unwanted side ef-
fects:

—-LSU, a genuine Southern power, will go to
no bowl.

—0hio State, one of the nation’s finest, will go
to no bowl.

—Penn State and Texas will each to to a dif-
ferent bowl, and they will drool at each other from
1000 or so miles.

Like a Smithsonian relic, the current bowl sys-
tem creaks and gasps, with each step seemingly its
last. But long-revered institutions die hard. and no
one as yet is prepared to intone this system’s last
rites..-

The ideal solution would be a national elimina-
tion, such as the one that determines the colle-

- giate basketball champions. This, of course, is hard-
ly feasible, due to the great amount of time it would

require-

What the bowl system needs desparately is a
national selection committee t supercede the sec-
tional rivalries, antiquated conferences (prohibi-
tions) and other parochialisms that exist solely on
inertia.

The sites of the various bowls could be ro-
tated, to appease fans from as many different areas
as possible. Perhaps by paring a few superfluous

bowls and rationally choosing candidates for the

others, a committee such as this might restore some
of its lost splendor to the decaying post-season.

Gridders Gain Post -Season Honors

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Post-season honors have
come to several Panther grid-
ders this week, as fans and
writers alike have turned their
attentions to the “all-everything”
teams and post-season bowl con-
tests. ‘ ‘

Senior Dave Magyar and sopho-
more Ralph Cindrich were named to
the Associated Press all-East
first team, while senior Geoff
Brown has been selected to
play in the East-West Shrine Game
in San Francisco later this
month.

(lt’s also expected, but not of-
ficially announced yet, that sev-
eral other gridders will be invit-
ed to play in the various post sea-
son contests such as the Hula
Bowl, North-South game or Senior
Bowl.)

Magyar’, the senior center from
McKeesport, has been a three-
year regular for the Panthers and
he opened many a hole up the
middle for running backs Tony
Esposito and Denny Ferris.

Cindrich, who was named to a
first-team linebacker spot, was one
of only two sophomores to gain All-

Marinaro of Cornell, who finish-
ed second in the nation in rushing
with 1,409 yards in nine games.
