Dr. Bowman Takes
A Quiz, Explains
Student Queries

0 By FRED LANGE

Chancellor Bowman took an oral examination before the Pitt
student body Friday morning in Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial hall,
answering a series of speciﬁc questions furnished by the students
through an SFA poll.

In an informal forty-minute talk, Dr. Bowman told some 1,000
students, excused from third hour classes that:

1. He did not favor an increase in tuition.
2. A student union building, to be valued at over $1,250,000, is
planned for the Fifth avenue side of Frick acres.
3. He deﬁnitely endorses the position of fraternities at Pitt.
4. He would like to see dormitories built on campus.

Referring to the Cathedral as “the high building,” the chancellor said
that all construction work will be completed as soon as the money has
been provided. Such funds, he said, must come from gifts and endow-
ments, not from state appropriations.

Dr. Bowman stated that no secrets are intended to be kept from any-
one. The University budget is published annually and an audience with

the. chancellor is not forbidden to anyone, student, faculty member, or per-
sons in any way connected with the University.

A , University with No Rules

“I would like to see a University with absolutely no rules except that
every student he a gentleman. We are not made in such an ideal fashion,
but we have come as close to it as any university in the country,’ ’Chan-
cellor Bowman maintained.

Facts regarding the percentages of the student education cost are given
in detail in the January issue of the magazine Pitt, declared Dr. Bowman.

In accordance with the chancellor’s policy of building only when the
money is on hand. the nationality rooms are ﬁnanced entirely by gifts.

Explaining the Common’s room gate as an exception to this rule, the
chancellor told the story of the huge iron structure.

“Mr. Yellin worked on it for 5 or 6 years,” he declared. “We felt we
would have the money for it, but the gate and the bill was delivered, and
there was no money,”

“I took Dr. George Clapp (president of the Board of Trustees) to see
the gate and asked him if he didn’t think it was wonderful. He did, and
said ‘you can send the bill for it to me.’ ”

A plan for a student union building, 450 feet long, running parallel
to Fifth avenue 50 feet back from the street, has been drawn, the chan-
cellor revealed. He said that the building would cost $1,250,000, but only
the plan was ﬁnished. He conﬁrmed the rumors that other buildings
would be constructed on campus, but not within the near future.

“The opinion held by the administration in reference to fraternities
is that they should be there,” the chancellor told students.

Dorms to Surround Cathedral

.A plan for dormitories beginning at the Foster memorial, extend-
ing along‘Bigelow boulevard to Fifth avenue and to the Fifth avenue en-
trance, has been drawn. Nothing beyond a plan has been completed,
however. ‘

“Your dormitory and your fraternity house is a place where principles
get into the life of a student,” Dr. Bowman declared.

Dr. Bowman read the formal statements of the duties of the chancel-

A college is a place where you have to get hold of some principle

you profoundly believe in and you know that the educational tools you
are getting are going to fulﬁll those principles andhelp spread them.

No matter what they tell you when you -takea job like this, you have
to go and get money. , It isn’t just speaking a piece. You don’t ask any-
body for money. You go tosee a man over and over and you try to make
him feel what you think,-u3mn‘ere living for. The .. one compliment I have
gotten since living in  came from a man, “if nobody else be-
lieves..yonr..,stuﬁ,...;gtou..do.i:l,....._..,  .. . .     ..

I talked to one man who offered me $5,000 and I said no. He offered
me $25,000 and I said no. He offered me $100,000 and I told him I didn’t
want him to give me any money if he,couldn’t say thank you when I
took it. ‘

, You can pay football players all you want to, but tell the world
about it. Then you can’t get games with the universities you want to.
If you say you don’t pay them, then don’t do it. As for football I’m for

don’t win half the time, it’s because of the company we’re in.

to. live together on the basis of letting the other fellow live? If I could

answer that question, I would be tomorrow morning the most famous man
in the world. How is that going to be done? Certainly it is going to
revert back to the individual if he is living the kind of life in which that
government could be possible. Why all this hate in the world? Hate
is a means of war. These are the kinds of questions we should be asking
ourselves now. ,

lor from the bylaws of the Trustees and said that one of his duties was
not included-—obtaining money.

Relating some experiences in his quest for funds, Dr. Bowman asserted
that he ﬁrst tried to convince wealthy men of the principles upon which
the University was being built before accepting donations.

“If you can’t give me some money and say thank you, I will not take
any,” the Chancellor said he told men to whom he talked about Pitt.

Duties of the provost, Rufus H. Fitzgerald, are the same as the chan-
cellor’s according to Dr. Bowman, who, smiling, also said, “All the dirty
work I turn over to him.”

T uclc Shop for Lunch-Carriers

About $25 of student tuition goes for activity fees, Dr. Bowman
pointed out. As to the possibility of an increase in tuition fees, he said,
“I prefer to let the thing stand as it is.” “ .

Lounge furniture was placed in the Commons room, he revealed, but
it was removed as it was not adequate.

The purpose of the Commons room is to prevent confusion in cor-
ridors by congregating students. ‘The lighting problem may be solved
by placing lamps in small cups and throwing the beams upward, the chan-
cellor said.

Dr. Bowman explained that hot food is not served in the Tuck shops
because of the attitude outside the University that such a system would
compete with restaurants and would make the University subject to taxes
as a commercial enterprise. ’

He promised a-room for students who carry their lunch to eat in, but
just when and where it would be constructed, the chancellor did not
state. '

Alumni relations of students and the students part in building Uni-
versity policy were two topics not answered because the entire third hour
had been consumed.

Dr. Bowman answered 9 out of the 11 questions voted by students
as the most‘ important and the added one, concerning the foods in the Tuck
shop.

Payments Due,
Warns Carlson

First Semester Plan

Beneﬁted 16 Students

Today is the last day in which

students may sign-up for hospitali-
zation insurance.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of

Men’s Student Health service is-
sued his ﬁnal call for payment of 1
the second semester hospitalization “

fees amounting to $2.50, payable
at the treasurer’s ofﬁce, 7 State
hall.

Designed to further the student
health program on campus and to
insure students against ﬁnancial
worry caused by serious illness, the
plan is in its second year at the
University. It was introduced
through the Pitt News last spring,
and, with the Student Health serv-
vice as sponsor, has received the
full approval and support of the ad-
ministration, faculty, and students.

During last semester 16 students
received beneﬁts from this plan.
The total number of days of the
student hospitalization was 93, and

had they not had health insurance .
the total amount of the bills would 1

have been $467.85. Within the last

few days eight students have had

appendectomy operations and have
received hospitalization under the
health insurance plan.

As to the far—reaching effects of
this plan, Dr. Carlson said, “With
University students protected
against the dilemma of insufficient
funds in time of serious illness by
a hospitalization insurance plan, I
predict a sharp rise in the func-

tioning ability of the Men’s Health)
service, whose decisions to place the»

students in a hospital must many

. times be disregarded because stu-ts

dents are not ﬁnancially prepared
to meet the expenses.”

Speciﬁc services that will be ren-
dered in time of illness to those
who subscribe to the plan are:

(1) Room and board in ward
accommodations for a total of 21
days each school year in any of
Pittsburgh’s 25 largest hospitals.
The students may select accom-
modations in a private or semi-
private room with an allowance of
$3 per day toward the purchase of
these better accommodations.

(2) Use of the operating room
as often as necessary.

(3) Anesthesia as often as neces-
sary.

(4) Ordinary drugs and medica-
tions.

(5) Necessary dressings and
casts.

(6) Routine laboratory services.

(7) Ordinary x-ray.

ICG Delegation llrganizes to Prepare Plans
For Eighth Annual Convention in Harrisburg

The Pitt delegation to the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Govern-
ment will organize this week as
the group prepares plans for at-
tendance at the eighth annual con-
vention in Harrisburg late next
month, chairman Sam Rodgers, C41,
announced today. The ICG confer-

Branning, instructor in political sci-
ence, is faculty adviser to the group.

The Intercollegiate Conference on
Government, an organization of
over forty Pennsylvania colleges and
universities, meets each year to
dramatize some phase of govern-

ence this year will be in the form
of a model state legislature.

Rodgers requested all students
interested in the government con-
ference to meet Wednesday at 3:30
o’clock in 132 Cathedral when the
Pitt delegation will organize.

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the political science de-
partment will speak at the meet-
ing. The group will set up nine
committees to prepare‘ laws for sub-
mission at the general convention
in Harrisburg. Dr. Rosiland L.

mental activity. This year’s meet-
ing, a model unicameral legislative
body, will take place April 24
through April 27. Over 400 students
from schools throughout the state
are expected to attend. Last year’s
Pitt delegation included 30 students.

The conference is a non-partisan
group made up of students and
faculty from social science classes
of Pennsylvania colleges. Organi-
zed in 1933 as a laboratory for po-
litical science courses, it has con-
tinued its experiments in model

government for eight years.

The laboratory program is strong-
ly supported by the University po-
litical science department which
considers the conference instructive
experience for students of govern-
ment and other social sciences, Rod-
gers says.

The conference last year, timed
for the period before the presiden-
tial nominations, was in the form of
a model political convention. Dur-
ing the years when the General
Assembly meets at Harrisburg it

takes the form of model state legis-
latures.

Some years it centers on other
phases of government, including a
model constitutional convention,
and a model conference of state gov-
ernors.

Your Fashion Future for Spring, I91!-I

“A C0li"iPi.ETELY NEW
AND DIEFERENT LOSE”

By MAXINE ALLE2»?
Stfaist and Fzisiiien Vv'rite:',
Rcsen‘oaum’s

Ycu‘ll never be the same if
you’re style-wise this S_rring and
Summer . . . You’ll be as full of
sudden surprises as a l\'l'_1‘«.':x:
Brothers’ epic, for Fascination is
the keynote of the new fashions
and the designers and the fash-
ionists have given you variety
as the keystone for your fascina-
tion! ’1‘hey’ve given you
variety in a new and different
look in fashion design, they’ve
given you variety in fabrics and
fabric treatment, they’ve given
you variety in color combina-

tions~in accessories . . . They’ve
assembled the gayest, most
heart-warming fashions from

friendly nations. They've made
history live again on your backs
and your heads in fashion revi-
vals from our rich American past

. . And, most important of all
(though no one will ever know
it, when they admire your
clothes) they’ve given you all
this variety at a small price, for
the smartest fashions this year
are co—ordinated fashions; fash-
ions not thrown together, but
grown together and in our store
and in the show today, you’ll
see them shown together!

This afternoon you’ll see we’re
not just saying all this about va-
riety, about the new and differ-
ent look, color, revivals, etc. . . .
But in order that you won’t miss
seeing the fashions for the shes
who are modeling them, watch
for these things: Note this year’s
new and different look that will
make you a model of fashion
with the look of a fashion model!
. . . Note our streamlined skirts,

our lengthened Waistlines, our
smoother shoulders, our bright
colors, our ﬁne dress details that
give you the look of a gal with a
private, clever dressmaker. Note
the variety in fabrics . . the
new light and bright colors in
your dress and casual fabrics.
Note how the coats depend on
fabric and color for their dress-
iness!

Note the new bright colors in
accessories . . . accessories have
never been so important. This
year they give spice and drama
to your costume . . . They alter
your fashion picture; show your
complete change of mood! . .
They’re bri.ght when you’re in
an exciting, people-have-more-
fun-than-anyone mood . . .
They’re blended when you feel
like a lady of quiet mystery . . .
They’re red when you’re in a
let’s - chase - ﬁre - engines mood!
They’re patriotic when you’re in
a ﬂag-wavin.g, here-comes-the-
band mood! . . . Accessories can
turn you into a dozen different
yous between Monday morning
and Saturday night! . But
write this on your ceiling in let-
ters ten feet long . . . BUY AC-
CESSORIES WITH A PUR-
POSE. COME IN AND ASK
US ABOUT THE MAGIC FOUR
ESSENTIAL RULES IN COLOR
COMBINES.

Look for fashions with the
Greek in.ﬂuence, the South
American way with colors, the
Chinese look, the British im-
peccable tailoring. Delight in
fashions right from our history
books: shirts from the cow-
puncer’s back, uniforms from
the Army, the Navy and the Air
Force, denims from the pioneers

and collars from the Pilgrim
maids, skirts from Indian
squaws!

Note the Americana theme . . .
stronger than ever before .
not only in the American heri-
tage fashions but in the constant
combinations of red, white and
blue and emblem insignias .
This year you’ll show your love
of country from day break to
last dance! . . Your lounging
clothes show the Betsy Ross in-
ﬁuence . . . your casuals are
spiked with old glory colors and
your sport dresses and most
formal daytime clothes have reg-
imental buttons and insignias
that have marched straight from
the parade ground on to your
clothes to make a more fascinat-
ing you! . . . Note, too, the mid-
dy blouse inﬂuence, designed to
give you the combined look of a
little girl and a rakish, light-
hearted tar! And your hats! . . .
Look and see how many inﬂu-
ences you can recognize there
. See the gob caps . . . the
parade bonnets . . . the oﬁ”icer’s
hats . . . and note, too, how em-
blems go bewitchingly to your
head, this patriotic Spring, 1941!
Come over to the Schenley
Ballroom this afternoon and go
east and west and south, young
woman! . . . Not only will you
see a new and and different type
of fashion show, for we’re cele-
brating this ﬁfth one with color
and drama and music and lights
. . but, you’ll be inspired with
a desire for more variety in your
wardrobe, for a new and differ-
ent look for yourself-—and when
that happens you’ll ﬁnd yourself,
spang in the Spring, more fas-
cinating than you’ve ever been
before in all your days!

sports, lighter richer shades with
smarter twists, better tweeds,
and bold diagonals. In all, a
young fellow immediately loooks
for “comfort” and this
season it’s really in and going
to stay a long time.

Of course, present-day condi-
tions have inﬂuenced every type

I

of design and style . . . all
leaning toward the military
side. In men’s wear this is not

too evident, but pops up just
here and there, and mostly in
accessories. They’re showing
red, white, and blue in socks,
ties, hankies, jewelry and what
you may.

In this show today you’ll no-
tice emphasis on trends you’re
already familiar with . . .
mainly, the three-button single
breasted suit . . a style that
has really made quite a hit with
college fellows. The coats feat-
ure the longer length with or
without center vent . . used
for both semi-sports and town
wear. A truly comfortable cut
in styling, and a proven best
seller. Then we have a revival
in the two-button single breast-
ed model . remember it?
Well it has the longer peaked
lapels and usually in a modiﬁed
drape. Coverts, cheviots and
tweeds are still the thing to
wear. All smartly worn with
contrast slacks to make up that
extra ensemble at every little
cost. Length and cut of trousers
are practically the same with the
not too extreme pegged bottoms.

Seen, in the more banker-
like, “business” type of suit . . .
are the new soft blues, grays
and browns, with the broken
contrasting stripes of maroon,
rust or blue and gray, to add a
bit ‘of new interest to a conser-
vative model. The double
breasted, peaked lapel lounge
model is really typical of the
more casual feeling in the con-
servative colorings and cuts. The
lapel cuts across the front of the
coat, to express a clean sweep,
as if a shawl collar. It’s some-
thing different for town, after-
noon cocktails, or at the theater.
Accessories may be brilliant . . .
shoes dark in mahogany, stained,
tan or black.

Topcoats are again leading the
season in coverts, tweeds. and
camel’s hair . . especially in
the naturals and khakis and
heathers in soft tones. You’ll
ﬁnd single breasted models worn
more this season . . . ﬁy front,
box and raglan. Still it’s quite
evident that for on the campus,
the better grade of “raincoat,”
in a smartly cut gabardine or
whipcord with regular lines in
styling, will be popular
for extreme “rough wear.”

For formal, fashions still hang
on to the two button single and
the double breasted tux .
both peaked lapels in silk gros-
grain, and grosgrain striping on
the trousers. The trousers MUST
BREAK on the shoe. Waistlines
are just as high, coat lines are
long and full-draped to add both
height and width to the upper
portion of the body, offering
maximum comfort. The breast
pocket is low, not to clash hand-
kerchief with boutonniere. Here’s
a new trick that might be worth
trying for formal wear . . . it’s
the contrasting of tie and bou-
tonniere such as, a wine tie and
blue boutonniere . . black or
yellow, or what you will. But
be careful as it does go wild at
times._ Tails are for strictest
f01”ma11'Ey and must be worn
with correct taste. Tie and vest
of_ matching pique, two stud
Shirt» high wing collar, black
hose, shoes and pumps of mack
patent leather . . the former
being the more practical in col-
lege. Here you have the most
polished and perfect attire with-
in the hurr_ibles_t of budgets.

But Spring 1S on its way and
that means the white dinner
Jacket with shawl collar, and
cut from palm beach cloth and
other interesting summer fab-
rics. Wear your standard formal
trousers with it or switch to
other colors, maroon or navy
blue. Soft front shirt, with turn
down collar . . . black, maroon
or blue tie with matching or con-
trasting boutonniere as you pre-
fer.

This could go on and on, but
the best is still in store, A
better - than - ever fashion show
awaits you this afternoon at the
Schenley Hotel. See what your
m0T}ey 15 golng to buy this
Spring see what Rosen-
baum’s has to offer . . that’s
where we come in. Just say the
word and we’ll deliver the goods.

Stickel Scores Upset Victory

Over Ewell in 69-Yard Dash

Harold “Happy” Stickel, Pitt
junior, with a last minute surge,
pulled off the top upset of the IC—iA
championships Saturday night 
ﬁnishing ahead of Penn State’s bril-

liant Barney Ewell in the 60-yard '

sprint.

Another Panther, Bill Carter, was
close behind Ewell and tool: third
place. Stickel’s time was 6.3 sec-
onds. one-tenth of a second slow-
er than Ben Johnson’s meet rec-
ord, set in 1938.

Despite the unexpected victory in
the sprint, Pitt’s bid for the IC-lA
team title fell short, and the Pan-
thers had to be content with a sec-
ond place tie with New York uni-
versity. Fordham university’s 25%.
point total was more than enough
to better Pitt’s 19. The Rams hung
up three ﬁrsts and two seconds in
winning.

With both Doyle Rhoades and
l\Iaurice Jessup consistently clear-
ing better than 13 feet all season,
the Panthers had looked for an
easy triumph in the pole vault, but
the best they could get in the event
was Rhoade’s share of a ﬁve-way
tie for ﬁrst. Dusty just brushed the
bar from the uprights as he sailed

ax: =x:

#=

over the 13 feet one inch level, and
the result was a deadlock among
Rhoades, Broemal of Columbia.
i‘vl-qlrtin of l\Ianhattan, Cromwell of
Rhodc Island state, and l\.acomber
of Yale at 13 feet.

Walter Sterner, Panther senior,
finished slightly better than ex-
pected and took third in the two-
mile run behind Prohosky of
Northwestern and Schmidlein of

Fordh am. The Pitt mile relay
foursome could no better than
fourth, trailing St. John’s, Ford-

ham, and NYU. The Saints set
a blistering pace, ﬁnishing in
321.6.

Notable were the failures of three
Pitt seniors who had been counted
upon to add valuable points. Del
Anderson in the 600, Dave Mc-
Dowell in the high jump, and Joe
Newman in the high hurdles all
failed to place.

Only one meet record was broken
during the evening. Leslie Mac-
Mitchell of NYA successfully de-
fended his one-mile title in 4:12,
beating Johnny Haley of Holy Cross
by more than 50 yards and lapping
most of the rest of the ﬁeld. Mac-
Mitchell had stepped off the dis-

tance in 4:07.41 earlier this year.

Panther Cagers End Season on Dismal
Note as Penn State Gets Revenge, 36-21

For 25 minutes out of 40 Dr. Cliff
-Carlson’s Panther basketball team
held Penn State in check Satur-
day night. Then something snap-
pel and the Lions ran wild in
avenging a previous defeat by a
36-21 margin.

Big John Barr, all-time Nittany
great, ran his three year total to 506
points by scoring ﬁve ﬁeld goals
and two fouls, top individual mark
‘of the game.

It was spectacular shooting by
Barr, Red Moffatt, and Gross that
ﬁnally swamped the Panthers. State
‘held only a 10-9 lead at the end of
the ﬁrst half, and in ﬁve minutes of

the second half the Lions had up-
ped the count only to 14-13.

Here the Pittsburghers col-
lapsed. Barr connected twice from
center court, and Moffatt slammed
one in from far out. Moffatt found
Gross loose under the basket for
a score, and an instant later Gross
tallied a beautiful one-hander.
Herky Baltimore’s basket and fouls
by Baltimore and Moffatt ran the
score to 28-13 before Pitt counted
again.

A brief Pitt rally, sparked by
Ed Straloski who led the Panthers
with eight points, narrowed the
gap to 30-21, but Gross and Mof-
fatt put the game on ice for State.

Special Correspondent
Picks A Si-City Cagors

9 By KAL KAL‘v\'AI»‘.Y

A review of the 1940-41 city col-
lege basketball season reveals four
important historical events in local
athletics:

1. This indoor winter sport is
becoming more and more appeal-
ing to the spectators, as evidenced
by the greatly increased attendance
figures here, as well as everywhere
else.

2. Duquesne’s veteran team, for
the third consecutive year, proved
to be the class of the district and
one of the nation’s top ten entries.

3. Pitt’s senior ﬁve surprised and
gave us our best record in more
than a decade.

4. Carnegie Tech did not sur-
prise and equalled its all-time low
-—a victoryless campaign.

All-City Five

No expert counsel was needed for
me to choose the city’s ﬁve stars of
the hardwood. Almost everybody
is agreed that Chick Davies’ “Iron-
men”—Moe Becker, Rudy Debnar,
Paul Widowitz and Ed Milkovich,
and Dr. Cliff Carlson’s Eddie
Straloski are without competition
or comparison. They comprise my
all-city quint.

Under-the-basket and long-shot
artist Moe Becker is, in my book,
the ﬁnest all-around courtman in
the tri-state area. The lank Bluff-
man is a tireless worker, clever
passer, sure dribbler and an adept
feeder.

Second in bucket value in Smog-
ville is the speedy, sharp-eyed
Eddie Straloski. Dr. Carlson’s
pride-and-joy is quick on the start,
and can travel at a terriﬁc pace
with a low dribble that admits him
into scoring position, Where, if cor-
nered, he can pass the leather to a
teammate to take a shot. Straloski’s~
defensive play is near perfect and
he possesses an uncanny ability for..
diagnosing plays. ‘
Look—-A Ballet Dancer

Paul Widowitz, who can garner
points with the best of them, is
particularly valuable in retrieving
the ball off the bank board. The
big Dukeman is a smart feeder, an
accurate passer and heady. Cap-
tain Rudy’ Debnar——captain of the
Dukes and captain of this mythical
club because of his poise—-is as de-
liberate as a ballet dancer. He
rarely wastes any motions; every

| 71.... gpad 5:4; 3,.

move he makes counts. Debnar is
a good shot from any part of the
floor and one of the most intelli-

gent defensive operators in local
history.
Dependable, But—

Ed Mill-:evich is a southpaw

whirlwind. The husky l‘.’llll{y is an-
other in a long line of Duquesne
long—shot stars. He is a tricky
dribbler, has a great competitive
spirit and is always on the alert.

Dependable ball players, but
without the natural smoothness,
aggressiveness and durability of the
aforementioned athletes, are the
Duke’s Lou Kasperik and Bill
Lacey, Pitt’s Mel Port, Sam Milane-
vich, Larry Paffrath and “Lefty”
Ziolkowski, and Tech’s Randall
Burch.

Grady Readies
Pitt for ESCA

With the dual meets on the Panth-
er swimming schedule already writ-
ten into the record books, prepara-
tions are proceeding at a furious
pace, as Coach Ben Grady readies
his Pitt mermen for the Eastern Col-
legiate festivities at Rutgers univer-
sity, next Friday and Saturday.

A dozen aquatic aggregations are
scheduled to compete for the East-
ern Collegiate swimming associa-
tion championship. In addition to
Pitt and Rutgers, the other schools
to be represented are Brooklyn,
Carnegie Tech, CCNY, Delaware,
Franklin and Marshall, Lafayette,
Lehigh, Manhattan, NYU, and West-
ern Reserve.

Rutgers, Franklin and Marshall,
and Pitt are the big guns of the
meet. Each squad has several in-
dividual star swimmers. And al-
though the Cathedral lads don’t own
a very enviable record this season,
they stand a pretty good chance of
sneaking through on the victorious
end.

Swimmers with Grady are Dick
Ames, Joe Kaule, Herb Cosgrove,
Joe Orlon, Gus Wilde, Al Samson,
Bob ‘Soles, Al Fedor, Art Vitartis,
Marty Kramer and Bob Jackson
scheduled. » .

Recently the suggestion was set
forth by a prominent local football
mentor that the method of lettering
and numbering football players be
revised so that the spectators would
have little trouble identifying each
individual.

We feel that the present system
is the best thus far advanced by
anyone. To prove our point we use
the following arguments:

0 These Are Arguments

In the ﬁrst place, some method of
providing for players being shifted
from one team to another will have
to be adopted. Just imagine a short,
stocky varsity player being re-
placed by a tall, lanky athlete. The
problem here would be how to ﬁt
the athletes properly.

Secondly, we feel that players
can be more easily remembered by
thinking of them in correlation with
certain numbers. Such great play-
ers as Grange, Harmon, and Rea-
gan are substantial proof of this
statement. Had each of these foot-
ball immortals been clad in a uni-
form based on the proposed meth-
od, he probably would not have
been as easily identiﬁed.

Third, the disposition of the pres-
ent uniforms would present a major

problem to athletic authorities,
should the method of lettering and
numbering the players be revised.
Unless a gigantic plan of changing
the present jerseys were adopted,

the entire crop of present equipment
would have to be charged up to
waste.

It’s true that most followers of
the gridiron sport might not agree
with our three arguments, but nev-
ertheless it must be admitted that
they do hold some measure of truth.
Until these problems mentioned can
be successfully and conveniently
corrected, we prefer the method
used at the present time.

0 The Status Quo

Now a bit about this much talked
about new system of revising the
numbering of players. According
to advocates of the plan, ﬁrst
string players will bear a large num-
ber beside the letters of the posi-
tion which they play. Athletes on
the left side of the line will have
odd numbers and players on the
right side will wear even digits.

This would, according to the pro-
ponents of the idea, make the task
of identifying players easier for the
fans. The argument advanced for
the plan is that persons looking at

The pre-season favorites, Phi Kappa, were upset by the Phi Gams,
47-43, Thursday night in one of the best Fraternity battles to date.

Mike Mitchell was the top man of the Phi Gam attack with nine

ﬁeld goals and a foul for 19 points.

Panthers Brill
For Ohio State
Opening Game

With the opening game with Ohio
State only a few weeks away, the
University of Pittsburgh baseball
squad is busy getting itself into
shape. The Panthers have been
engaged in preliminary drills for
over a week.

Over 30 athletes are attending
the practice sessions. It is not too

late, however, for any athlete to
ﬁll out his eligibility card and re-
port to the Stadium for workouts.

All of the drills thus far have
been held under the Stadium on
the miniature diamond constructed
last year. Emphasis has been laid
upon sliding and limbering-up ex-
ercises.

Regulars Return

Practically all of last season’s
regulars have already reported to
coach Mitterling and are hard at
work preparing for the season’s
opener. In addition to these letter-
men, Mitterling will have a num-
ber of new athletes with whom to
work. Among those reporting for
the ﬁrst time are footballers Joe
Rettinger and Bob Malloy.

One of the bright spots in the
Pitt pre-season workouts is the fact
that the departments which were
weak last year have been somewhat
strengthened. Both the pitching
and ﬁrst base position will be much
more potent this season than they
were in the 1940 campaign.

Practice Sessions

Practice sessions are divided into
two sections. Pitchers and catchers
will hold their drills from 3:30 to
4:30 o'clock in the afternoon while
the inﬁelders and outﬁelders will
workout from 4:3'0 to 5:30. Anyone
desiring to participate in baseball
this year should have his eligibility
status taken care of prior to his re-
porting to the Stadium.

Outdoor practices for the Panther
baseballers will not be held until
the weather deﬁnitely breaks. Un-
til then all candidates will report
to the diamond beneath the Sta-
dium.

. ‘About the Numbers
‘ Racket in College Football

By John Chaffo

a football game seldom know the
athletes individually, but have to
look up the number in the pro-
gram.

We blame all this discussion on a
certain member of the Pitt News
staff. Here is how the whole thing
got its start.

0 The Other Side

When the new plan was advo-
cated, this rather bright reporter
added this comment: “Why not
change the new method slightly?
Instead of using the odd and even
numbers, why not put the letter on
the side of the back of the player
that corresponds to the side of the
line on which he plays?”

Well, ‘we had to admit that this
was a little improvement, but still
held to our primary opinion. The
present system is good enough for
us. We’re old fashioned, so what?

Glenn played his usual good game,
but the Phi Gam’s tight zone de-
fense, which managed to tighten in
every crisis, was too much for the
Phi Kaps.

The undefeated Sammies con-
tinued on their title march with a
4-4-18 victory over the last place
Sigma Chi ﬁve. Morris Mayer led
the SAM team with nine ﬁeld goals
for 18 points.

The Kappa Sigs, who have been
knocking on the door of victory all
season, ﬁnally won from a major
team by upsetting the Phi Eps, 24-
22. Bob Lesko topped the scoring
with four from the ﬁeld and one
from the foul line for nine points.

The fourth place PiKA team
seemed to have recovered from the
upset handed them by the Phi Delts
last Tuesday, as they walloped the
Delts, 38-20. Whitey Carlson led
the scoring with 21 points.

In the last two games the Phi
Delts and Theta Chi won the easy
way, as Lambda Chi Alpha and the
Pilams forfeited their games.

Stotz to Analyze Current
Affairs at Town Meeting

Speech Centers
On New Trends
In Balkan Crisis

Continuing the present series of
discussions on current events, Pitt
town meeting will present Dr. Carl
Stotz, assistant professor of geo-
graphy, this afternoon at 2:30
o’clock in 244 Cathedral. The sub-
ject of Dr. Stotz’s speech will be
“Analyzing Contemporary Affairs.”

Dr. Stotz’s appearance at Town
meeting marks the third time that
faculty members have spoken be-
fore the group this year. Dr. Charles
W. Lomas, instructor in speech,
spoke on the presidential election,
and a roundtable discussion featur-
ing ﬁve members of the faculty, led
by Roy H. Umble, instructor in
speech, marked the other faculty
event.

Dr. Stotz will center his talk this
afternoon around a discussion of the
Balkan crisis, and will explain re-
cent developments in that area.

The lend—lease bill will also be
discussed by Dr. Stotz, who will
analyze the significance of the bill,
both in American and international
politics.

If time permits, Dr. Stotz plans
to answer the question, “What kind
of peace?” with a prediction of the
peace that will follow the current
war in the event of either a British
or an Axis victory.

‘The next series of discussions to
be presented at Town meeting will
deal with the problem of labor re-
lations, according to Esther Marcu-
son, C41, chairman of the com-
mittee.

Art Critique

Associated Artists’ Exhibition I s
‘Homey, Cozy, U nimpressive’

. By ANITA PAT nanoxs

The other day, one of my very
learned friends and I took in a
couple of the art exhibits which are
currently being shown throughout
Oakland.

First we took in the Associated
Artists exhibition. This is strictly
home talent stuff. This group of
artists, all living in and around
Pittsburgh, all affected by the same
surroundings, the same smog, and
the same scenes from the Hill dis-
trict, produces a group of pictures
whose theme is similar in some in-
stances but nevertheless, varied.

The Associated is a cozy home-
like show. If your uncle isn’t a
member, your cousin is. If you
don’t have a relative, you have a
friend that belongs. If this fails,
your former teachers are highlight-
ing the exhibit. And if you don’t
‘fall’ into one of these last categories,
you surely know someone whose
portrait is hanging, or maybe your
backyard was the inspiration for
one of the prize-winning master-
pieces.

Which all goes to make the ex-
hibit an intimate and genuine part
of Pittsburgh.

But we do think the exhibit is
one of great contrast. There are a
few painters exhibiting who deserve
and have national reputations, and
then there are the immature ama-
teur dabblers who paint for their
own amusement and other people’s
frank amazement.

The next exhibit we visited was
the show of ceramic plaques made
for the Pittsburgh Housing author-
ity under the WPA Art program.

These plaques are on view over
at the galleries in the Board of
Education building. Eventually
they are to be incorporated into
exterior decorations of future units.

The plaques depict the various
vocational ﬁelds such as, steel cut-
ting, steel puddlers, shoemakers
and laborers.

Most of them are creative prod-
ucts of amateur artists working
with limited facilities and talents.
Nevertheless, some of the would-
be-artists have achieved evidences
of a potential mastery of composi-
tion and color. Though some of the

attempts are primitive in character
they may be, in time, developed
into something signiﬁcantly import-
ant.

 

Free of charge to the students, the University is
offering special courses in engineering, including en-
gineering drawing, descriptive geometry, production
planning, metallurgical inspection, materials inspec-

tion and testing, x-ray testing, electrical maintenance
and testing, machinery inspection, and spectroscopic

testing.

Al stepped into Heinz house, last
Tuesday evening. A pert young
miss in white French apron and
chic white cap requested his hat

and coat and led him to a seat in
front of the ﬁre. He was on time
at the Mortar board dinner for
ODK men. A table shaped like an
ODK key ﬁlled the left end of the
room. The aproned miss spoke no
word, but she did bring him a True
Story magazine to while away the
ﬁfteen minutes till the stragglers
came. Thus began an evening
which featured Miss Rush and her
trotting waitresses, plus Ted Bid-
dle’s hairy-legged boys in one of the
most hilarious shows ODK has ex-
perienced since Cap and Gown,
1910. Bill Patrick pulled an “Oh,
you kid!” act that would make any
show since 1901, and Robert C.
Machesney tripped his “Hellza-
poppin” routine with Adele Yorio.
Dave Tucker led the men’s chorus
in a bare—kneed hop-kick number
that had chairlady Betty Dils and
Prexy Gene Pyle literally rolling in
the aisles. Now, we know why
ODK men have been grinning at
Mortar boarders all week! Five
stars for an evening of suspense!

Exodus: Assistant dean Cor-
ley’s secretary, Betty Jane VVallace,
leaves the green-carpeted office to

Most of the classes meet evenings and Saturdays,
and enrollment totals 2,000 students, none of whom
’ are enrolled in regular University classes.

Dr. G. R. Fitterer is in charge of the University’s
symposium on metallurgical inspection. Eighteen spe-
cialists in all ﬁelds of metallurgy, including chief
metallurgists of leading companies and Army and

Navy officers, comprise the list of lecturers.

By Grace McCombs
and Fred Rohie

entrain for Princeton, this week.
She goes to work for George Gal-
lup. Does Dave Farrelly really
have something there?

She were red roses; she liked-
Harry James; and she was gorgeous.
Mysterious Roy Ruane has ﬁnally
revealed the little girl next to his
heart. A girl seen only from a
wallet picture, she at last appeared
in the ﬂesh. Anne Vogel, who
studies dietectics in the graduate
school of Ohio State, came to Pitts-
burgh to dance with our own Roy
at the I-F. Hats off this week to
Columbus!

Bowties and barebacks at the I-F:
Hal Byer stiff-shirting with sales-
girl Evelyn Kaufman from Squirrel
Hill . . “Dee Jay” Bailey and‘
Peggy Matheeny of PCW hill . .
Bob Stodgell and Olga Lois whiz-
zing past the bandstand . . . Al
Gross and Bettie Kalish . . . Dave
Tucker and we can’t remember
. . . Tom Westerman and . . .
(How did all these Independents
get in here anyway?) Orv"
Ice and Charlotte Harris (There’s
something ﬁshy about that; we’re
trying hard to remember the Heart

Hop . Julia De Leo and some-
one Whoever he is, he’s. a-
lucky man.

“There’s nothing new under the
sun,” and then M. A. De Vitis
nodded his head to one of the love-
ly ladies in his modern language
62 AR to add, “You fellows in this
class have nothing on me; I held
her in my arms long before any of
you ever did.” Poor Rhoda
blushed, but it seems the good
linguist lived across the street
from the Plummer’s when she was
the little kid on the block.

Communique: Ginny Childress
sparkles a nice—sized ring as indi-
cation that the Navy has captured
another prize. The Thetas tell ‘us-
he’s some Ensign!

Engineers 'Atha Lambert, Pete
Shanta, and Jim Rial met in 828,
last Thursday afternoon. They
wanted to sell tickets for the IA
dance, but, they didn’t know that
business manager Wilson was'n’t
passing out tickets to the I-ball un-
til today. Good luck! Atha, Pete,
and Jim! The IA “needs you!”

Gee, Whiz: We don’t like to say
anything, but did we see Mary
Ruth Carlson at the William Penn,
Friday (minus Toerge); or wasn't
that some other daughter of a doc-
tor?

Immigrant: Did you" see Cornell
Bob traveling through the snow'to
sweep into the William Penn with
Dorothy Ann Carrier or were the
drifts too deep? It’s a good idea
anyway!
