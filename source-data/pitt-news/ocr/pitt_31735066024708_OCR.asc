Smith chosen to fill vacant Student Government slot

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

Melissa Smith will fill the vacant Student
Government Board seat left by the
resignation of Abbie Campsie.

After Friday’s open forum, the board
released a statement explaining, “that Ms.
Smith’s proven leadership ability and
knowledge of the university’s
constituencies and governing bodies
qualifies her for the position of [SGB]
member.”

Smith’s platform addressed the ‘‘lack of
adequate, safe study areas on campus”
and suggested extending Hillman Library's
hours. According to Smith, she already

spoken to the interim director of the
University Library System, who said
extending Hillman’s hours was feasible.

As co-president of the Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance, Smith said she has
worked closely with both university
officials and students. She also has worked
as as a cultural-diversity facilitator and
teaching assistant for freshman studies
and said she knows the “nuts and bolts” of
how an organization runs. Smith resigned
the co-presidency of BiGALA after being
appointed to the board.

The board’s decision was met with
mixed reactions by those attending the
meeting. Immediately following the
announcement, Kevin Docherty, one of

the unsuccessful board candidates, yelled
out, “This is a travesty to the students of
this university. She could never have been
elected by the students of this university.”

SGB President Gil Golden informed
Docherty he was out of order and would
be given a chance to speak later. After
being called on, he continued his objection.
“She could never be elected as a member
of BiGALA to the SGB by the students of
this university. You people have failed 
You really have failed, and I feel that
there’s going to be a lot of backlashing
against you as a board. You made a big
mistake.”

Later Docherty said, “I feel the students
of this university could never be properly

Former Pitt
ofﬁcials will
repay close
to $112,000

By Jenna Ferrara

Two of four men charged with
stealing from Pitt’s food service
and the Golden Panthers sports-
booster club will pay the university
back more than $112,000.

The Allegheny County district
attorney’s office made a deal with
four former Pitt officials who were
charged with stealing more than
$146,000 from the university last
summer.

Criminal proceedings ended
against Robert J. Heddleston,
former executive director of the
Golden Panthers; Emanuel Perry,
former general manager of food
service; Donovan Hughes, former
food-service director; and L. Keith
Fammartino, a Beaver dentist and
former Golden Panthers president.

The defendants will be admitted
into the Accelerated Rehabilitative
Disposition program for first—time,
non—violent offenders because the
troubled university administration
had encouraged an
unprofessional atmosphere,
according to deputy district
attorney Michael Ahwesh.

After completion of ARD and
probation, the defendants’
criminal records will be erased.
Admission into ARD must be
approved in court.

Heddleston will pay back the
university $51,155, and Perry will
return $61,000. Although the
district attorney’s office estimates
that Hughes owes Pitt about
$5,600, negotiations with him are
still continuing, Ahwesh said.
Fammartino will not make any
direct payments, according to
Ahwesh.

He said the amounts paid back
to Pitt were based on estimates
provided by the university.

“We determined how much was

Axiom of Choice swept
the 1992 College Bowl for
the second year in a row
amid complaints that the
team members’ graduate
status gave them an unfair
advantage.

Axiom of Choice and the
second-place Grue Ravens
team were comprised
entirely of graduate students.
The third-place team, Barely
Awake, consisted of
undergraduate members of
the political science
honorary society.

Members of Barely Awake
were surprised by their
unexpected success but also
voiced dissatisfaction about
having to compete against
graduate students.

“We all agree — there
should be a separate

category for the graduate
teams. It seems that they
have five or six more years
of study, ” said BarelyAwake
team member Joe Foner.

Philip Sharman, a member
of Grue Ravens, said, “I can
see their point. I think that if
I were an undergrad, Iwould
feel the same way.”

But Axiom of Choice

' member Michael Gadberry

disagreed. “I don’t think it's
unfair at all to have
undergraduates and
graduates play together. If
we were playing for
thousands of dollars, I might
be able to understand, but
we’re playing for fun,” he
said. '
Director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla said
this is the first year he has
heard students complain
about graduate and
undergraduate students

competing together.

“I’ve been working with
the College Bowl for four
years now, and this is the
first_ time I’ve heard
complaints, but we'll look
at this phenomena for next
year’s tournament,” he said.

Cavalla said the national
rules allow graduate and
undergraduate students to
play together.

For Axiom of Choice
captain Michael Young,
winning isn't new.

five years. Last year we

won." Members of Axiom

[SGB] did this just to appease [BiGALA].
They’re appeasing a very small group
instead of the whole student body. The
SGB just caved in to the BiGALA people."

Smith said she finds it ironic that Docherty
would make these statements without
ever having spoken to her. “

“I think he’s working on his own personal
biases, or obviously I would not have
been selected for this position. Ultimately
the decision was made by the board.
Kevin Docherty should not be acting as a
judge in this situation. I made myself clear
on what I’m working for,” Smith said.

University
administrator
to run for seat
in Congress

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pitt business school administrator Marick
Masters said he will run in this spring’s
congressional Democratic primary in a
campaign managed by University Democrats
President Joel Leonard.

Masters, who has never held elected office,
works as the director of the university’s
master's of business administration program
and has also been a professor of business at
Pitt.

“Many of the things that I do require the
same kinds of skills a member of Congress
would need to successfully pass legislation,”
Masters, 37, said.

Masters is running in the primary for the
congressional seat currently held by Rep.
Rick Santorum.

Lack of experience in politics is an asset,
according to Masters. “I believe it is important
that people who have not chosen politics as
a career enter politics,” he said. ‘‘I think they
understand fully what the needs and concerns
are ofthe typical American  I'm not running
to perpetuate the status quo.”

Leonard said Masters’ “experience and
expertise in the business world academically
and through other participation certainly
qualifies him to address the issues that we’re
facing,” Leonard said.

Masters’ goals if elected to office are
“reinvesting more in fiscal capital  and
human capital, that we make sure the work
force of tomorrow is as productive a work
force as possible,” according to Masters.

He also wants to fund Head Start and job-
training programs and allocate more funding
for,higher education. Insufficient health care
is also one of Masters’ concerns.

He will not formally announce his A

candidacy until the district lines are drawn
by Jan. 28 in the state senate. If the senate
doesn’t decide by this date, the decision is
made in federal court. The primary will be
held April 28.

He decided he wanted to run for Congress
after former Rep. Doug Walgren was defeated

Demoma’f0rN07;Dl&mt big/9 in Pittsburgh

By Kim Palmiero
Sta_[)" Writer

The demand is high in Pittsburgh for
Norplant, a birth-control device inserted
underneath a woman’s skin, according to
Mary Litman of Women's Health Services.

“We've been doing three or four insertions
a week,” said Litman, WHS director of
education and public relations. Women’s
Health Services, a non-profit organization,
has been ready to do Norplant insertions
since August 1991. Norplant is also available
locally at Planned Parenthood of Western
Pennsylvania, Magee-Womens Hospital and
some private-practice physicians.

Approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in July 1991, Norplant lasts
for five years and is completely reversible.
Made up of six matchstick-size silicone
capsules which are inserted just underneath
the skin of the woman’s arm, the capsules
slowly release the hormone progestin which
inhibits ovulation and helps block passage
of the sperm by thickening cervical mucus.

The cost of receiving the device is $550,
but according to Litman, the cost is relative.
“If you cost it out over a period of time,

Norplant is cheaper than [birth-control
pillsl.”

Norplant’s effectiveness rate is over 99
percent, which makes it “as effective as
sterilization, except Norplant is reversible,"
Litman said.

Women interested in using Norplant are
first given counseling to which allows
them to understand the benefits and
disadvantages before they make a decision.
“What we've noticed is an extreme amount
of caution as well as curiosity. Women in
Pittsburgh are more curious than women
in other parts of the country,” Litman said.

But not everyone is curious about
Norplant..According to Litman, “The [pro-
lifel people have already said that Norplant
is an abortive agent."

Litman said pro-life activists stalled
Norplant’s entry into the United States. But
“no groups have given Women's Health
Services any trouble except in their general
feeling about birth control,” she said.

When asked if the recent controversy
over silicone breast implants has made
some women nervous about using N orplant,
Litman said, “What I see is that there is a
slight'resistance to surgery, but it is done

under a local anesthetic. There is nothing
uncomfortable about the procedure.”

According to a pamphlet released by
Women's Health Services, some possible
side effects of Norplant include irregular
bleeding, ovarian cysts and ectopic
pregnancy.

In addition, women with certain medical
conditions, such as inﬂammation of the
blood vessels and acute liver disease, are
not advised to use Norplant. “ T h e r e
have been no problems with the insertions
that have been performed at our facility,”
Litman said.

The cost of receiving Norplant is covered
by Medicaid, which to date is the only form
of insurance which covers the cost.

“A lot of women who have low incomes
have requested it because Norplant is
covered under Medicaid,” Litman said.

But women must make the commitment
to delay pregnancy for ﬁve years, or Norplant
is not cost—effective.

Many college women have opted to use
Norplant, Litman said. “N orplant is good for
college students because it gives you freedom
and safety while still allowing you to enjoy
a full sexual life.”

University ’s Pugwash
explores technological,
environmental issues

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

Student Pugwash may have a funny name, but its dedication
to help preserve the earth is serious.

Pugwash will give students an open forum to discuss the
environment,techno1gy and science and its effect on them.

“It’s important for citizens to realize ... how they are participants
within science, as citizens paying taxes to the government that
funds scientific activity and as consumers,” said senior Mark
Myers, who started the Pitt chapter of the international
organization.

Myers, an ecology major, said many students are interested
in a program like Pugwash because it gives them an opportunity
to talk about social and ethical issues.

“I’m really interested in getting people from all departments
and all backgrounds involved in this because science and
technology affect all of us, not just the scientists. We welcome
anybody. We want a dialogue. We want people to start thinking
about these issues,” he said.

Pitt junior Sarah MacMillan, also an ecology major, said
Pugwash is important because “there’s a gap between sciences
and your general public. A lot of times in the laboratories, they
don’t deal with with outside issues.”

Myers said Pitt’s Pugwash chapter is hoping to be recognized
by Pitt soon and is in the final stages of drafting a constitution.

Fraternity returns after 5-year absence

By Heather Gahres
For The Pitt News

One of the original fraternities
at Pitt is returning after a five-
year absence. Last semester 10
students reactivated Alpha Phi
Alpha.

Alpha Phi Alpha Vice President
Sekou Coleman said, “The re-
vitalization of Alpha Phi Alpha
primarily boils down to the fact
that it was the first fraternity for
black men in the nation. It
also has a long tradition of
creating great African-American
leaders.”

The fraternity’s famous alumni
include Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and former Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall.
“People who are interested in the

- fraternity know what an honor it

is to be a part of it,” Coleman
said.

Coleman said his interest in the
fraternity was sparked by various
role models. ‘

“My father was an Alpha, as

well as my pastor and scout
leaders. I’ve wanted to be an
Alpha since I was in high school,”
Coleman said.

Coleman has been waiting for
the past three years for the
fraternity to be allowed back on
campus.

The university investigated the
fraternity after two pledges
were injured in a hazing
incident.

As part of the re—organization
Alpha Phi Alpha is in the process
of regaining its recognized status
by the Office of Student Activities
and the Inter-Fraternity
Council.

IFC external Vice‘President
Chris Block said, “I think it’s great
they’re re-activating. Any time a
group of people can get an
organization like this off the
ground, it’s an achievement, and
I hope they start by being active
in the IlfC.”

“Talking to people in Student
Activities, they said that Alpha
was always very active and we

want to take an _ active role,”
Coleman said. ,

“We want to put our name out,
so people will see us all around
campus.”

Past members have participated
in the Judicial Board, Student

- Government Board and the Black

Action Society.

Organization is the goal for this
semester, with Pittsburgh-
area alumni assisting the nine
brothers.

Coleman said, “We want to be
able to build upon a good
foundation, as opposed to having
programs and not being able to
follow through with them.”

Because of the re-organization

process, the fraternity will not be

taking on any new pledges until
the fall.

THE PI‘IT NEWS, Monday, January 27, 1992

By Kirsta H. Bleyle
Staff Writer

A new piece of equipment for
handicapped athletes is available
at Trees Hall.

Since most weight-room
machines are inaccessible to
handicapped individuals, Jim
Costello of Pro-Medical Mobility
(the only company in Pittsburgh
to deal the Versatrainer) was
understandably excited about the
development of the equipment.

Costello is wheelchair-bound
because of an accident and
discovered the advantages of the
machine while undergoing

physical therapy.
The Versatrainer is designed

for use by both handicapped and
able-bodied individuals and
consists of rods which provide
the resistance equivalent to metal
weights on conventional
machines. The Versatrainer works
the chest, abdomen, shoulders,
arms and back.

It is accessible to handicapped
individuals because they are able
to approach the machine in a
wheelchair and work out while
staying in the chair. More
advanced athletes with harder
workouts can have their
wheelchairs belted to the pad in

 a T rees Hall receives wbeelcbair
[ , accessible athletic equipment

front of the machine to keep
them stable.

The machine at Trees Hall will
soon have a removable bench to
make the machine accessible to
everyone.

“The advantage of this is you
don’t have to transfer out of your
chair,” Costello said. “It’s difficult
to transfer to many of these
machines, and then [the
individual] is not even stable."

The machine is also
advantageous to women who
work out at Trees because this
machine eliminates the problems
they have with machines which

Hand-in-Hand, looleingfor volunteers

By Christine Hanna
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Pitt’s Hand-in-Hand Festival is
preparing for its 14th year of
helping handicapped children
from the Pittsburgh area.

According to activities
committee member Lizanne
Batinich, about 400 mentally and
physically handicapped children
will attend the festival on
Saturday, March 28 in Forbes
Quad.

“It’s a lot of fun, and we need
volunteers,” Batinich said.

Hand-in-Hand is looking for

800 to 1000 volunteers to be with
the children, to help serve food
and to roam the festival as clowns.
Students who are photographers,
artists or have other talents are
also needed.

One-on-one volunteers are
paired up with the children and
take them around to the many
different activities throughout the
day. According to Batinich, no
prior experience is needed, but
volunteers must attend a brief
educational session.

“You get a lot of personal
experience [participating in the
festival]. The whole festival is

adapted to [the children]. Just
seeing them laugh or smile makes
my day,” Batinich said.

Hand-in-Hand plans many
activities during the day for the
children and brings in area
mascots and different radio and
television personalities.

Local restaurants and busin-
esses donate food; a medical staff
is provided, and about 40 Pitt
organizations setup game booths.

Hand-in-Hand is a non—profit,
student—run organization.
Applications can be picked up in
the Towers Lobby or the William
Pitt Union information desk.

are traditionally designed for men.

Because of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which went -
into effect on Sunday, any organization receiving federal
funding must make its facilities accessible to handicapped
individuals.

Even if only one area of the university receives federal
funding, the entire university must comply with this act,
including the facilities at Trees Hall.

Costello said the more accessible the university becomes for
handicapped individuals, the more likely it will be that these
individuals choose Pitt. Trees Hall has the only Versatrainer in
Pittsburgh.

He would also like to see the development of a “general
fitness team” for handicapped individuals because “most people
think that wheelchair athletes are just racers and basketball
players, but that’s not true at all.” He cited examples of sports
such as skiing, tennis, squash and handball as other opportunities
for these athletes.

Anyone who would like to receive training on the Versatrainer,
can call Marilyn Ross, co-director of Intramurals and Recreation,
at 648-8277.

When asked if they were
disappointed after losing to
Axiom of Choice for the second
year, one member of Grue
Ravens joked, “Was Dukakis
disappointed when he lost to
Bush?”

College Bowl teams consisted
of four players who answered
questions about everything
from opera to science.

Students offered creative

names for their teams such as
“Spam Lovers," “Blood, Sweat

Wabbit.”

Five rounds were played in
all, with members of the Pitt
Program Council keeping score
and asking questions along with
Cavalla.

All is not lost for those
contestants who competed but
did not place because the
winning team is not the one
which will advance to the
regionals, Cavalla said. Instead,
individuals from different teams

will be picked.

“We're going to look at how
people answered questions:
how well, how quickly and
who really knew the game. The

Lim, who is the Program Council
coordinator, will decide who
will make up the All-Star

The group is planning events
for the University of Pittsburgh

regional conference to be held at
Carnegie Mellon University in
February.

Katie Kroehie, the CMU
conference coordinator, said the
conference will be a combination
of panels and discussions, as
well as groups that will
probably consist of about 10
students.

Each group will address a
different topic and will be joined
by professionals from different
fields.

Tentative discussions include
dependence on foreign oil,
natural-resource accounting and
government programs with

less waste.

Origins of Pugwash go back to

“I viewed that as an
opportunity to pursue a
congressional bid.”

Leonard said, “He’s not running
for the office to be a professional
politician. He’s not running for a
huge salary. He’s running for the
office to really make a difference
 I think the voters will recognize
that, and they will definitely not
just vote for Marick but want to
vote for Marick.”

Masters describes Santorum,
who was elected to represent the

district in 1990, as an
“opportunist.”
“I think he’s done some things

that are not representative of the
people of western Pennsylvania,”
such as voting against extended
unemployment benefits, Masters
said.

Masters summed up his own
platform in a sentence: “Marick

Interest-free loans are now available at the University of
Pittsburgh; sounds like a great deal for struggling students.
For many students unable to pay tuition on time and
consequently denied student services, an interest-free
loan sure can help. But in this situation, students cannot
apply. The university has reserved funds only for former
employees caught scamming money from the university.

After negotiations with university officials, criminal
charges were dropped last Thursday against four
individuals involved with stealing over $146,000 from Pitt.
The gang of four are Robert Heddleston, former executive
official of the Golden Panthers, Pitt’s booster club for
athletics; Keith Fammartino, former president of the club;
Emmanuel Perry, former general manager of Pitt’s food-
service department; and Donovan Hughes, former food-
service director. They could not have arranged a better
outcome.

Allegheny County District Attorney Bob Colville said
none of the men will be brought to trial and they will only
repay the money they were accused of diverting. Perry
will pay back $61,000, while Heddleston will give Pitt
$51 , 1 33. Fammartino will walk away with no punishment,
and discussions with Hughes are continuing at this time.

Deputy District Attorney Michael Ahwesh said, “Given
the totality of what happened, [jail terrnsl didn’t seem like
the proper disposition. We have no indication the money
Heddleston and Fammartino [allegedly diverted] went to
personal benefit.

“We determined how much money was missing and
said, ‘This is how much you owe,”’ he said, justifying this
unbelievable act.

Of course the university was quick to underscore -the
ridiculous and even offensive deal they set up with the
alleged embezzlers.

University Counsel Lewis Popper said, “The university
is glad to have the substantial sums of money returned,
but at least as important is the heightened deterrent

‘ .agains't similar misconduct by others.”

So, essentially, the university is saying that despite the
mishandling of funds which have plunged Pitt into
scandal for the past year, damaging its academic and
ethical reputation, the most important thing is to get back
the hundred grand.

Obviously the university did not want to go to court,
because no doubt past and present administrators would
be called to the stand to “tell the truth.” It would have been
quite a circus to see former officials like ex-President
Wesley Posvar, ex—Athletic Director Ed Bozik and ex-
Executive Vice President Jack Freeman" on the stand,
confirming our deepest fears.

At the least, testimony would have reiterated exactly
how asleep at the switch these “educators” supposedly
were. At the worst, the entire upper echelon of our
university may have been exposed as corrupt.

We assume that somewhere in between these two poles

' is the truth. The university administration has faltered by

preventing the truth from coming out about what really
happened. Only by revealing the truth can the ghosts of
Pitt’s crooked past be finally exorcised.

Racism clouds King celebration ,

[On] Jan. 19, 1992, I stepped into
an elevator in Tower C and, to my
horror, I saw, printed in big, bold

Letters

because the leading mastersof
these demeaning activities are
done by our leading oppressorsi

letters, the words, “HAPPY
NIGGER DAY.” I am furious that I am still being so
blatantly subjected to racism, especially on the eve
of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King _Ir.’s birthday. It
upsets me that this is going on almost 25 years after
his death. I am outraged that as a student at the
University of Pittsburgh I am being regarded with
such a lack of respect by racist bigots. A

If progress is defined as a gradual betterment,
then America has in fact regressed. We have
regressed to the point where white supremacist

groups are sprouting up like weeds all over the
country.

We have regressed to the point where ignorant
racists can write “HAPPY NIGGER DAY” on an
elevator and think it's funny. There is only one
reason why Cuban nationalists can seek political
asylum in the United States while Haitian nationalists
cannot. There is only one reason why George Bush
can “free” the people of Kuwait, but he can do
nothing for the people of South Africa. (If you think
apartheid is anywhere near over, think again.)
There is only one reason why minority scholarships
have been revoked. If you haven’t guessed by now,
the reason is racism. 1 am infuriated that such racists
have the gall to feel they are superior to me on the
basis of the lack of pigment in their skin.

To all you small—minded and shallow racists, if
you are going to be a bigot, don't be a coward about
it. Why not have an open forum and tell what it is
about me that intimidates you? Tell me what
satisfaction this narrow—minded practice of
downgrading a people gives you. If this is your
contribution to the world, talee it bacle.

Prejudice abound

On Monday, Jan. 20, 1992, Martin Luther King
Day was celebrated. Although the holiday is not
understood by everyone because of ignorance to
Dr. King's causes and means, I have evidently come
to understand the meaning of what it means to be
a member of an oppressive society. I am not a
woman of color or of ethnic descent, but [I] fall into
one of our nation's greatly oppressed groups. I
belong to the gay and lesbian movement, which in
“societal norms” is a launch into guilt, shame and
twisted living. I can be denied housing, a job,
adopting a child, making love to a partner and love
and support from friends and family. Is this a part
of the American dream?

Anti-gay and lesbian graffiti has become
permanent artwork at Hillman Library and the

. William Pitt Union. Constant verbal bias against"

gays and lesbians can always be heard in any
campus building. Much of this is unmentioned

hetero-arrogant oppressors. Our

sexual—orientation clause at Pitt is a joke. Words do

not mean anything when they are not enforced.
(Consider the inclusion of ROTC on campus.)

The University of Pittsburgh needs to actively
become involved with its gay and lesbian students.
Our needs and concerns are unique and need to be
treated accordingly.

We’re not the anal—banging, vaginal—groaning
militants you perceive us all to be. We're your
contributors to this economically sufficient
university. Taking advantage of the campus
organization’s bisexual, gay and lesbian student
association’s information tables and office material

will aid in reaching a knowledgeable and meaningful
understanding of the queer culture and lifestyle.

And for those of you who can't understand, in

remember: We're here; We’re queer! Get used
to it!

Publicity damages

The current controversy in the black-studies , .

department is lamentable partly because it has
become public in a way that may damage the
reputation and goals of Chairman Brenda Berrian.
I have known Professor Berrian for well over a
decade and have always been impressed by her as

a person and a scholar. She is a person of the

highest integrity, low—key, personable, fair-minded
and considerate of others. She has a passionate
commitment to students and treats them and her

colleagues and staff with respect; despite the j

impression created by the Turner—Anise controversy,
she in turn is well liked and respected by them. She
exemplifies the greatest devotion to professionalism
and academic excellence, and in conversations
with her over the years she has expressed a

commitment to making black studies a department —
where professionalism and scholarship are-given,‘

priority and are rewarded.
By being so public, the affair may also damage
T urner’s reputation. His side of the issue has

received the great bulk of media coverage; I cannot,

speak to it because I do not know all the facts. The
sad thing is that Turner, also, is a good person,
serious and committed. Fortunately, there are
procedures within the university for him to air his
grievances and receive a fair hearing.

I just want to urge others not [to] rush to judgment
in this affair. I myself am highly optimistic about

how things will develop’ in black studies under , ~ I I

Berrian’s leadership.

What looked to be a close

» meetaweek ago turned out
to be a cake walk for the Pitt
men’s swim team, when
Villanova bowed to Pitt, 1 53-
89, at Trees Pool on

‘Saturday.

Villanova, which has
historically given the
Panthers a tough time at the '
Big East Championships,
limped into Pittsburgh with
only 15 swimmers, missing
some of its best athletes
due to injuries and academic
ineligibility. The result was
another blowout, in which
the Panthers won 12 of the
13 events.

“Their depth was not what
we expected at all,” said Pitt
senior captain Eric Daum.

“They usually do give us
a good meet, [but the
injuries] probably
demoralized them,” Eric
Mattson said. “I was talking
to one of the swimmers,
and he summed it up: ‘Every
time we get close, we shoot
ourselves in the foot.”’

A victory looks good for
the overall record, but the
swimmers’ times were
relatively slow. This is to be
expected, considering
where the Panthers are in
their training schedule. The
plan is to peak for the Big
East Championships in four
weeks, but even that is not
a good enough excuse for
some.

“I was satisfied that we
got the win and everything,”
Mattson said, “but time-
wise, I was very
disappointed.”

Joe Kozlina began the rout
by winning the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle events with
times of 21.07 and 46.50,
respectively. Captain David
Schepner (1 :44.67) and first-
yearstudent David Williams
(1:45.29) ﬁnished first and
second in the 200 freestyle.
By the time the divers
stepped on to the one-meter
board, the meet was all but
over.

The Panthers didn't need
a strong showing from the
divers, but they got one
anyway. Villanova only
entered one diver, and Pitt’s
divers took advantage. Mike
Naylor won the one-meter
board with a score of 518. 1 5.
Steve Wolfe finished third,
and Phil Cruz and Scott Ruth
tied for fourth.

Cruz rebounded by
winning the three-meter

Wrestlers split with Navy, Cleveland St.

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer

The Panther wrestlin g team continued down
a brutal schedule, earning its first Eastern
Wrestling League victory of the season but
dropping another tough non-conference
match over the weekend.

Twenty-fourth ranked Pitt defeated
Cleveland State 20-16 to even its EWL mark
at 1-1 on the season, but the 14th-ranked
Navy Midshipmen dealt Pitt a difficult loss,
22-15, Saturday night at_ Greensburg Salem
High School.

Against Cleveland State, Bobby Simpson
(126 pounds) remained unbeaten (2-0-1) by
wrestling to a draw, but Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said he felt that Simpson
was a victim of a questionable call.

Simpson had control of his opponent in the
final period, when the official called him for
stalling and awarded a point to the Viking
wrestler.

“I thought it was a terrible call,” Stottlemyer
said.

Five Panthers notched victories at Cleveland

State; Steve Budman (142), Scott Hovan (167),
Sean Gibbs (177), Jeff Kloiber (190) and Perry
Miller (heavyweight).

The outcome remained in question into the
final match of the night. With Pitt clinging to
a 17- 16 lead, Miller clinched the victory with
a 9-2 decision.

Stottlemyer said his squad was finally
coming together and that he expected the
Panthers to field their strongest lineup against
Navy. However Budman contracted an inner-
ear infection, and it appeared very doubtful
that he would wrestle.

The pattern for the Pitt squad all season has
been nip-and-tuck matches, and the battle
with Navy was no different, but the Panthers’
slow start cost them dearly. Early on, Pitt
suffered a huge letdown when Simpson got
pinned for his first defeat of the season. This

_ was a major swing, with the Panthers losing

a potential three-point decision and the
Midshipmen racking up six points. The next
two weight classes resulted in a fall and a
major decision for Navy. Pitt trailed 16-0. At
that point, the Panthers clawed their way
back into contention.

“We started ﬁghting like dogs,” Stottlemyer
said.

Sickness and all, Budman came up huge
with a victory at 142.

“He just did a heckuva job for his team,”
Stottlemyer said. “Stevie came off his deathbed
for us.”

At the 150—pound weight class, first-year
wrestler Joe Plouse earned a decision.
Stottlemyer said that Plouse has been
improving and that he wrestled an excellent
match. “He was the guy that really turned it
around for us,” Stottlemyerwsaid.

One of the matches that Pitt needed was at
158, where redshirt junior Mike Porter fell by
one point.

The Panthers stayed in contention, with
Hovan and Gibbs both notching their 15th
wins of the season. Hovan moved to 15-3
with a decision, while Gibbs upped his mark
to 15-5 on the year. -

The match that clinched this one for Na
was at 190, where Jeff Kloiber lost a 5-4
decision. Miller won another decision at
heavyweight and improved his record to 14-

Women’s swimming falls to Wildcats

By Brian Gallagher
Staff Writer

Villanova swimmers flaunted
around Trees Pool last Saturday
wearing T-shirts that read, “Some
live on tradition. We’re gonna
start one!” — an ominous
reference to Pitt’s dominance in
Big East swirrming. While it wasn’t
“Showtime” —— the conference
meet -— the Wildcats’ dress
rehearsal against the Panthers left
little doubt as to whether they
belong on the big stage with the
elite in Eastern swimming.

The Wildcat trio of Lisa Flood,
Sarah Dykstra and Mary Dowling
combined for seven first-place
finishes to lead Villanova past the
Pitt women, 152-136, last Saturday
at Trees Pool. Flood took
advantage of the fact that the
Panthers were without the
services of breaststroke specialist
Laura-Lee Sullivan in winning
both the 100- and 200-yard
breaststroke "as well as the 400-
yard individual medley.

Sullivan, a senior captain for
Pitt, missed the meet due to a
bout of recurring asthma, which
caused bronchitis. Having to
watch the meet as a spectator,
Sullivan appeared upbeat about
how her teammates performed
against a pumped-up rival.
"Considering the size of our team,
I think they did pretty well,”
Sullivan said. She added that
losing to the Wildcats is a bit
harder to take, in light of the fact
that the two teams don't exactly
like each other. “They loved to
beat us and rub it in our face,"
Sullivan said. “This is probably
one of our meaner rivals. ‘Nova
always seems to get kind of nasty.”

Nasty or not, the Wildcats
proved they will be a factor in
deciding who wins the Big East
meet next month. ‘Nova took 11
of a possible 15 first— place finishes,
defeating the Panthers for the
second consecutive season in
dual-meet competition.

Pitt continues to be hampered

An injury-plagued Pitt women's swim team suffered a loss to a powerful Villanova squad.

by a seemingly endless run of
illnesses and injuries. The
Panthers swam Saturday’s event
with only 12 healthy swimmers
and were forced to employ two

'6 swimmers who still hadn’t fully

recovered from health problems.
Pitt head coach David Belowich
said, "As far as the combination
[of injuries and illnesses] is
concerned, this is probably the
most I've seen,” Belowich said.

Concerning the performance
of the Big East rival Wildcats,
Belowich said he noticed a
marked improvement in his
opposition’s talent. “They had
two freshmen, Meaghan
McCaffrey and Kara Ryan, that
have definitively improved their
team,” Belowich said, adding that
‘Nova returned its entire squad
from last year.

A taste of things to come was
the competition between Ryan
and Pitt’s Christy Knobloch. The
rival first-year swimmers placed
one-two in both the 200
backstroke and 200 butterﬂy, with
Ryan winning the fly and
Knobloch taking the backstroke.

Knobloch’s backstroke win was
the meet’s most exciting race,
with the Pitt rookie winning by
just .02 seconds.

Another positive note_ for Pitt
was — no surprise here —— diving.
While it's starting to sound like a
broken record, Pitt’s divers
continued to rack up big—time
points in dual meets. Facing an
inexperienced Wildcat unit,
Donna Flatch, Kara Sixbury and
Anne Marie Rose finished 1-2-3 in
both one-meter and three-meter
events, turning a lopsided loss
into something a bit more
respectable.

While the Panthers’ health
continues to remain an issue, an
encouraging sign was the effort
of the formerly wounded: Crit
Gallagher and Laura Zdyb.
Gallagher, a senior freestyle
sprinter, raced for the first time in
two weeks. Having been sidelined
with tendinitis in both shoulders,
Gallagher returned to place third
in the 50 free and swam a leg in
the 400 free relay. “lMy shoulders]

Gallagher said. “After the 50, I

couldn’t.even pull myself out of
the water. But I iced them down
and swam pretty well in the relay.”

Zdyb, a first-year distance
swimmer who missed the first
half of the year with mono, placed
third in the 400 IM and took
second in the 1000 free. Due to
the shortage of swimmers
available, Zdyb swam the 1000 as
Pitt’s only participant. Zdyb said
she found this situation a bit
unnerving. “I didn't like it at all,”
Zdyb quipped. “It felt strange. It
felt like 1 bad to do well.”

Zdyb said she is pleased with
her progress so far, noting that
she wasn't sure how she'd
bounced back. "I’m very happy
with how I've done,” Zdyb said.
“I’ve come around a lot quicker
than I thought.”

Belowich pointed outjen Burns
as another swimmer who stood
out. “I thought Jen swam a pretty
good backstroke,” Belowich said.
Burns led a sweep of 1-2-3 in the
100-yard backstroke, with Janine
Atiyeh and Laura Nerone taking
second and third. ‘Burns is yet

THE PITT NEWS, Monday,.JanuarIylH27, 1992

Connecticut uses defense to defeat Lady Panthers

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Last season the Connecticut
Lady Huskies came to Fitzgerald
Field House on a 12-game
winning streak and were
undefeated in Big East conference
play. They left with a one—game
losing streak and a blemish in
their conference-loss column.

This year the Lady Huskies (12-
6, 5—3) came in with a less-
imposing 11-6 overall record and
their leading scorer and
rebounder on the bench with a
fractured left wrist. However they
emerged from the Field House
with an impressive 71-53 victory
over the Lady Panthers (7-10, 3-
5).

Despite losing first-year center
Rebecca Lobo to a fractured wrist,
Connecticut held the Lady
Panthers below 60 points. That
mark seems to be the “magic
point” for the Lady Husky squad,
as they have won 10 of 11 games
when they have held their
opponents below the 60-point
plateau.

While the final result was not
close, Pitt actually led for the first

10 minutes of the game. “They are a really good team,” doing, and we were not able to 1992 BSN

However a Tonya Boone jumper

Connecticut drought from the
field and brought on the deluge

Pitt clung to a one-point lead
until the 10:19 mark, when Pam
Webber drained a jumper to give
the Lady Huskies their first lead
of the game, 15-14.

Jonna Huemrich answered with
a jumper of her own to give the
Lady Panthers their last advantage
of the contest, 16-15. Connecticut,
led by Webber with nine points,
closed the half on a 22-8 run to
take a 57-24 lead into the locker
room.

In the second half, forward .

Wendy Davis took over the game
for the Lady Huskies. Twelve of
her 17 points in the game came
during the second half.

Pitt never was able to get any
closer than 12 points after a pair
of free throws by Huemrich made
the score 40-28 with 16:47 to
play.

Connecticut was able to stretch

board, with Naylor, Wolfe and Ruth
taking second’, fourth and fifth,
respectively.

Because the outcome of the meet
was decided so quickly, head coach
Chuck Knoles entered his swimmers
in events that they normally would
not compete in. First-year student
Matt Brady was a two—event winner
in the 200 bavkstroke and — in an
unusual event for him — the 1000
freestyle. Jeff Novotny was a
surprising winner in the 200 butterﬂy,
and, as usual, Don Boyd was
victorious in the 200 breaststroke.

“We were pretty confident that
we were gonna win,” Daum said,
“so shuffling us around in different
events gives us a different look,
mixes it up a little.”

Dealing with injuries isn’t a
problem exclusive to Villanova.
Injuries plague the Panthers as well,
but they seem to be on the mend.
Mattson couldn’t compete in the
breaststroke because of a nagging
knee injury. Matt Porter, Dave
Dodson and Jon Dixon have
shoulder problems, and Kevin
McLaughlin injured his ankles and
knees in Puerto Rico during
Christmas break. Pitt’s chances of
capturing a 10th Big East
Championship will diminish ifthese

athletes can’t recover by the end of

February.

“Hopefully they will be healthy,”
Knoles said. “We can’t win without
[having] them healthy. It is in the
hands of sports medicine and the
Big Panther in the sky.”

  

  

   

  

1 Q I THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Monday, January 27, 1992

Panthers neea’ to emphasize outside game

Is anyone tired of hearing about Pitt’s
woes at the free-throw line? Well, since the
Super Bowl was just played this past
weekend, I'd like to compare Pitt’s free-
throw problems to a football game. When
a football team finds something isn’t going
right in the first half, it goes into the locker
room and tries to correct the problem and
regroup —— hopefully to have a more
successful second half.

It’s now obvious that a number of Pitt’s
players can’t shoot free throws very well,
and they're not likely to get much better in
a week or two of practice in between
games. It takes months or years for
someone to improve drastically at the
free-throw line.

We’re now halfway through the season,
and it’s time for head coach Paul Evans to
take his team into the locker room, so to

Stephen Flinn

speak, and adjust his strategg to address
the biggest problem he has faced all
season: missed free throws.

Since Pitt has such inaccurate free-throw
shooters, adjust the game plan so that not
as many fouls are drawn.

I'm not saying scrap the inside game,
but rather use it to draw defenders in and
then kick the ball out to an open shooter
or perhaps another cutter heading for the
basket.

Either way, if the Panthers go to the line
less, they’l1 miss less free throws. It’s that
simple.

Evans’ style is to continuously pound it
inside, and that doesn’t help if the person

who drew the foul makes only one or
(even worse) no free throws. It’s almost as
bad as a turnover when that happens.

Pitt’s defense is as good as it’s been in
years, so if the offense can get on track,
Pitt has the potential to be an outstanding
team.

There’s still time for Pitt to have a good
season. Evans needs to pull everybody
into the locker room, make some

"adjustments and come out firing in the

second half.

The main goal is to try to win 20 games
and make it into the NCAA tournament.
The Panthers can do that by taking one
game at a time and treating the second half
of the season like the second half of a
football game.

All is not lost. There’s still time to be a
winner at the Fieldhouse.

Bulls even record with Win over Wings

Pittsburgh was also backed by the outstanding goaltending effort
of sixth-year player Kevin Bilger, a former Wing. Bilger played the

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Sta_ﬁ‘ Writer

In their season opener last week, the Pittsburgh Bulls were
outgunned by the defending Major Indoor Lacrosse League
champion Detroit Turbos, 25-15, in Detroit."

Hoping to avoid an 0-2 start, the Bulls played their home

first half and made 29 saves, mostly on low—percentage, perimeter
shots, allowing only three Philadelphia goals.
His play allowed the Bulls to take a comfortable 11-5 lead into the

locker room at the half. Goaltender Bob Heyes finished the night for

opener Friday night against a team they hadn’t beaten in the win.

two previous seasons: their cross—state rivals, the Philadelphia

Wings.

In front of a loud and exuberant home crowd of 6,800
(hey, it was Bullseye Bar—b—que Sauce Mug Night), the Bulls
raced to an early 7-0 lead in the first period and never looked
back. They defeated the Wings for the first time ever, 14-9.

Second-year forward Bob Martino led all Bulls’ scorers
with four goals and two assists, and forward Jeff Klodzen

netted three goals, all in the first half.

Martino’s effort would earn him the game’s MVP award.
“We all hustled out there. I just happened to be finishing the

job,’_’ Martino said.

STUDENT —ADMINIST

the Bulls, holding off a late Philadelphia rally and securing the Bulls’

Head coach Dennis Wey said he was pleased with his team’s effort,
saying, “All we asked was to come out and play a tough game.” The
Bulls’ defense, which was held suspect after its opening game in
Detroit, played solidly, keeping the Wings’ forwards from mounting
any serious offensive attacks until the game was out of reach. “This
is a nice win to get under our belts,” Wey said. ,

After Friday night’s game, the Bulls traveled to Boston for a game
against the Blazers, Saturday night at the Boston Garden. The Bulls

dropped that game by a score of 15-13, leaving them with a record

of 1-2 on the season.

Pittsburgh’s next game is scheduled for Saturday,’ Feb. 8 at 8 p.m.

at the Civic Arena against the Buffalo Bandits.

how much you owe,”’ Ahwesh

said.
“Given the totality of what

if happened, [jail sentences] didn’t

seem like the proper disposition.
We have no indication the money
[allegedly misappropriated] by
Heddleston and Fammartino went
for personal benefit.”

“The university is glad to have
the substantial sums of money
returned, but at least as important
is the heightened deterrent against

similar misconduct by others,”
said Lewis Popper, Pitt’s general
counsel. -

“We want it to be unmistakably
clear that anyone who puts the
university’s money to his or her
own use will be out of a job and
into the criminal justice system,”
Popper said.

.Heddleston, who resigned in
April 1990, faced four counts of
theft of funds and one count each
of criminal conspiracy and theft
of services, according to Ahwesh.
Heddleston was charged with
failing to pay $7,156 for a
university—catered wedding
reception for his girlfriend’s
daughter. He also allegedly gave
his girlfriend a $3,200 fur
coat donated to the Golden
Panthers. ‘

Fammartino faced one count
each of theft and conspiracy. He

‘Iago

W?!’ E

allegedly diverted money from
the Golden Panthers to a secret
bank account, where the money
was used for such purposes as
dinners for possible contributors
to the Panthers.

Perry, who allegedly stole
$90,000 from Pitt’s food service,
faced 11 theft and conspiracy
charges. .

Hughes faced one count each
of theft and conspiracy and
allegedly used $7,000 in
University of Pittsburgh funds for
non-business-related trips.
