‘ Tension at last night’s Student
Government Board meeting caused
board members to defend their vot-
ing methods and personal indepen-
dence p ‘ '

“There were several issues that
came up that stirred a lot of emotion
on both sides,” said public relations
chair Nikolai Condee—Paduno\r. “Un-
fortunately, it can sometimes be a part
of the process”

“This doesn’t have to burn any
bridges or cause any tension,” he
added

SGB denied a $17,500 budget
modiﬁcationafterCollege Democrats
informed the board that former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Fer—

_ raro cancelled her speaking event, to-

which the board had allocated funds
on Sept 16. I '
College Democrats Wanted to
bring a new speaker; political strategist
Donna Brazile, instead of Ferraro,
who cancelled the event based on
health reasons
Board member Perry Servedio
read a prepared statement before the
board voted on the change He said
that College Democrats had tripled
their original budget “at the eitpense
of every other student organization,”
by  the supplemental re-
quest for the speaker
‘$17,500 is tied up until Decem—
ber because Geraldine Ferraro is not
coming,” said Servedio "Ihat’s a lot
of money.” i
He said the group had not docu-
mented sufficient information to
prove that the event would occur,
such as proof of renting space and

Cathedral joins in city  
annual Festival of   Lights

by Caitlyn Christensen
‘Staﬁ’ Wrt'ter

The Cathedral of Learning will
bounce back into history tonight.
Organizers of the Pittsburgh
250 Festival of Lights arranged to
have the 42—story building bathed
in lights to resemble the Gutenberg
printing press, and approximately
two weeks from now it will be

I

decorated to fit a mathematics
theme. _

“The Cathedral is going to
have a whole new appearance,”
said Lucette de Rugy, the executive
director’ of 'Artlumiere, the
company that designed the display
for the Cathedral.

This is the first time Pitt will

participate in the_ city’s Festival
of Lights, which started last year

's

when organizers projected light
displays onto six Downtown
structures. This year, 20 buildings
throughout Pittsburgh will feature
light displays, making the festival
the largest light event in the United

States, according to its Web site.

displays for New York’s Grand

Ms. Phyllisl

becoming
a Lothrop
legend a j

by Dana Edmunds
Strzﬁ’ Writer

Lothrop Hall houses 676
students. That’s 676 names and
676 faces.

Although that doesn’t seem
like much compared to the
other dormitories on campus,

: .Lothrop does have something

to brag about. That is Phyllis
Harris, a security guard who has
a knack for learning students’
names and faces.

“Everyone knows my name,
so I think it would just be polite
for me to know eVeryone’s
name, too,” said Harris.

And everyone does know
her name.

Lothrop Hall resident
jenny Riecke said that Harris is

making a name for herself all

over campus.

. ‘‘Ms. Phyllis knows all of
our names and stops to talk
to us,” said Riecke. “Everyone
likes her. I don’t think you
could find anyone who doesn’t

. love her.” _

Riecke, a freshman, said
that having Harris know her

name made her feel more

A comfortable moving into the
 new dorm as she adjusted to

college life. .

A Harris said she also cares
about remembering students’
names because the students
are more than just people she
works with.

“It’s everyone important in
my life. And it keeps my mind
young, too,” she said.

For most students in the
on—campus hustle—bustle of
college life, it’s easy to hand
the dormitory security guards
a Pitt ID and sprint to the
elevators before they close. But

Harris doesn’t let that happen.

(“It would be crazy to sit here like a
robot, to sit here every day and not say
anything,” said Harris. “And you know, I

 like to run my chops.”

Siatta Dennis, a Lothrop Hall resident,
said she can’t wait to walk into her
dormitory.

“Every time I walk past, [Harris] is
always smiling, she’s always happy,” said
Dennis. “That’s what I love about her.
She’s’never angry, never mad. Her smile
brightens up my day.”

But Riecke and Dennis aren’t the only
Pitt students who have enjoyed their
swipe-in experience with Harris. I

More than 500 people joined a Facebook

group praising her.

Students from every ﬂoor of Lothrop
Hall have joined “The Phyllis Harris Fan

The group’s page says, “You can only

‘can’t complain’ or ‘so far, so good’ at least
50 times a day,” referring to phrases Harris
uses.

On the group’s message board, one
student asks when Ms. Phyllis’ birthday is.

“OCTOBER 15th!” responded Riecke,
“and she will be working!”

How to make the third
debate a success

 

Anyone who has watched the
presidential debates over the past
few weeks has probably noticed
that both were lackluster. They
have been an exhibition of ques-
tion-dodging and of both candi-
dates’ abilities to spout rhetoric
instead of substantive answers.

The third debate airs tonight at
9, and Bob Schieffer is the mod-
erator. It’s also the last chance
for Sen. Barack Obama and Sen.
John McCain to make a major im-
pression on voters outside of TV
interviews and campaign ads. That

we would like to see happen in this
debate that haven’t happened yet.

First and foremost, the can-
didates should ﬁnally attempt to
answer a question directly. There
have been too many times that
we’ve heard an excellent question
from the moderator, only to have
Obama and McCain either give an
answer_that is almost entirely hot
air or that is only thinly related.

Both candidates are politicians,
so there’s only so much that one
can expect in terms of a straight
answer, but the truth is that they
both stand to benefit more from
being honest than they do from
being guarded and rhetorical. Al-
most all the criticism about the de-
bates has been leveled at their lack
of substance, so delivering some
real answers would be good for
either candidate.

It would also be good to see
more active moderation. Both
Obama and McCain went over
their time limits in their answers
in the last debate, and yet Tom
Brokaw, for the most part, let them
do it. These debates have rules for
a reason, and they shouldn’t just
be Haunted so the candidates can

say everything they want to.

In addition to controlling the

being so, there are a few things that

candidates, Schieffer should chal-
lenge them on ridiculous answers.
Encouraging direct responses and
real discussion has been a stated
goal of all the moderators this
year, but so far none of them has
really done so. Schieffer wasn’t
afraid to cut off President George
W Bush or Sen. John Kerry when
he moderated their third debate
four years ago, but he has a much
bigger challenge to live up to this
time.

We also need to hear about
some new issues. It was unfortu-
nate that in the first debate 
Lehrer spent nearly half the time
with questions on the economy
instead of foreign policy, because
we heard almost everything the
candidates had to say about do-
mestic and foreign policy in that
one debate, only to heat the same
in the second. The third debate,
which is focused on domestic and

economic policy, is shaping up to .

be more of the same again.
Instead, there should be more
questions on what we haven’t heard
yet: What about Supreme Court
appointments? What about edu-
cation policy? Stem cell research?
These are topics that haven’t even
been glanced at yet, even though
they are hugely important to vot-
ers —- more important, in many
ways, than foreign policy.
_ Addressing some of these new
topics would be a good way to
break the candidates out of their
rhetorical loops and also to pro-
vide voters with important infor-
mation. I
Of course, it’s unlikely that the
debate will include everything in
this list. But the previous debates
simply haven’t been good enough,
and the issues above need to be
addressed if the last one is going
to be any better.

Have somet

hing to say?

Afghan strategy not Working

by Giles Howard

Cola/22/zidt

 

The British began the first
Anglo—Afghan War in 1839 when
they invaded Afghanistan and
occupied the city of Kandahar.
Within a few months, they had
decisively defeated an Afghan
army and installed a puppet king
on the Afghan throne. ‘

But in less than three years,
after a succession of attacks on
British personnel, the British real-
ized that the occupation was im-
possible to maintain. They were
forced to retreat, the puppet king
was assassinated, and of the oc-
cupying army of 4,500 men only
one survived to escape Afghani-
stan.

Britain was the greatest super-
power of the mid-19th century.
Its empire spanned the globe, and
its military might was unmatched
by its contemporaries.

But in 1842, the greatest em-
pire of the time was defeated by a

ragtag collection of tribesmenjin V

Central Asia’s backwater;

Today, the United States occu-
pies a similar global status to that
of 19th-century Britain, as well as
a similar defeat in Afghanistan.

Like the British in 1839, the
United States installed a puppet
government at the beginning of
the war — a government that
now controls only 30 percent of
the country, according to recent
estimates published in Mother
Jones magazine.

What’s more, the government
of Hamid Karzai has proven
completely incapable of provid-
ing its citizens with running wa-
ter, navigable roads or even food.
The ‘New York Times reported
that nine million Afghans face
“an acute food shortage this win-
ter.” That’s a quarter of the popu-
lation.

But one of theimost basic gov-
ernment functions is to provide
security, and in that area the Af-
ghan government has failed more
miserably than in any other. The
number of civilian casualtiesjhas
increased 39 percent this year, ac-
cording to the Christian Science
Monitor.

Much of that increase is be-

cause of actions of NATO and’

government forces. The Christian
Science Monitor reported that
“the number of civilians killed by
pro—government forces jumped
by 21 percent this year, and air
strikes were responsible for two-
thirds of these.”

But in spite of approaching
mass starvation and increased
civilian deaths resulting from a
campaign of bombings perpe-
trated by the U.S. Air Force, the
top American commander in Af-
ghanistan, Gen. David D. McKi-
ernan, said in a recent news con-
ference that the United States is
winning the war. “We don’t have
progress as even and as fast as
any of us would like. But we are
not losing in Afghanistan,” said
McKiernan.

Compared to the British ex-
perience in 1839, I suppose this
is winning. But by any reasonable
standard it would_ appear that
we’re losing, and no one is willing
to say it.

That is, no one except the
American intelligence community
is willing to say it. A recent New
York Times articles. reported,

US. needs to fix Afghan-

istan's infrastructure

Howard, page 6

“A draft report by American intelligence
agencies concludes that Afghanistan is in
a ‘downward spiral’ and casts serious doubt
on the ability of the Afghan government
to stem the rise in the Taliban’s inﬂuence
there.”

In short, the world has not paid proper
attention to the situation in Afghanistan.
Rather than seeking to win the hearts
and minds of the Afghan people, NATO
forces are terrorizing farriilies, bombing vil-
lages and doing their best to annihilate the
poppy trade, which is just about the only
proﬁtable occupation left in Afghanistan.

Such initiatives are only pushing Af-
ghans closer to the Taliban, which has
set up shadow governments and courts
throughout the country, according to re-
ports in Mother Jones and the Telegraph.

But rather than try to learn from the
disastrous experiences of the British and
Soviet occupations of Afghanistan, U.S.

commanders, as well as the two major
presidential candidates, simply call for
more troops as the solution to the Afghan
problem. 1

Maybe this is a short-term solution
to the problem; however, until there are
reliable water supplies, ‘paved roads’ and
enough food in Afghanistan, the Taliban
will always have support. The Taliban
thrives on chaos and conﬂict becausethe
one thing the Taliban can give the Afghan
people is the stability of a 600-year-old ide-
ology.

To deprive the Taliban of its base, we
must stop treating Afghans like collateral
damage statistics and "start treating them
like human beings who deserve freedom
from the medievalism of the Taliban,
from hunger and from the fear of U.S. air
strikes.

To the Editor,

I agree with the sentiments of Chris-
topher Stokum’s recent column regard-
ing same-sex marriage. The column as-
tutely identifies the underlying impetus
for the opposition to same-sex marriage
when he asks, “At what point in Ameri-
can history did it become acceptable,
and even commonplace, for the govern-
ment to interfere with matters of reli-
gion?”

Like Mr. Stokum, I see a rising threat
from those who would destroy consti-
tutional protections that have previously

excluded the United States from the re-
ligious tyranny that is becoming more
commonplace in today’s world.

Like proponents of Islamic Sharia
law, the opponents of same-sex marriage
have only one goal: the imposition of
their religious beliefs on everyone. This
should make gays as well as straights,
and Democrats as well as Republicans,
all shudder in fear.

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to Drew Singer’s
arguments in the Oct. 14 article titled “Pens
vs. Flyers tonight: But which city is the best
— Singer goes with Brotherly Love.”

Let me start by saying I assume Drew is
from the Philadelphia area, and that being

the case, I respect his opinion that Philly is

better than Pittsburgh. However, I do not
see validity in his arguments.
He expands the realm of relevant sports

. to include horse-racing, boxing and minor-

league hockey. If he wanted to wander out-
side the four mainstream sports of baseball,
football, basketball and hockey, then why
didn’the mention the Homestead Grays,
one of the most prominent Negro League
Baseball teams in history, having had 12 of
their players elected to the Baseball Hall of
Fame? Also, what about Paul Spadafora?
Paul, otherwise known as the Pittsburgh
Kid, was a boxer who won the IBF World
Championship in 1999.

\While Philadelphia has a solid sports re-
sume, it pales in comparison to the collec-
tive Pittsburgh roster. Pittsburgh has housed
some of the greatest athletes ever in their
respective sports. For hockey, it was Mario
Lemieux. For baseball, there was Honus
Wagner, Bill Mazeroski and Roberto Clem-
ente. And for football there were and are

countless names, including, but not limited
to, “The Steel Curtain” of Joe Greene, L.C.
Greenwood, Ernie Hohnes and Dwight
\X/hite; Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swarm, Jerome Bettis and Hines Ward.

And it should be noted that both Mario
Lemieux and Lynn Swann loved Pittsburgh
so much that after they retired, they both
moved here permanently.

The reason that we Pittsburghers are so ,

disgusted with hearing about Rocky — and
he hit that nail right on the head —— is that he
is not real! How can you be proud to show
off a sports icon who is from a movie? We
in Pittsburgh don’t need to have Hollywood
write fictional stories of gloriﬁed, million-
to-one athletes based in our town and then
ﬁlm movies about them to garner atten-
tion.

So congratulations, Philadelphia, you
have a football team that cannot win the big
game, a basketball team that no one wants
to play for, a few horses in the stable, a
couple of retired boxers of which the most
successful never existed, a hockey team that
has been mediocre at best in recent memory
and a baseball team with a mascot that looks
like a rejected Muppet. But, hey, at least they
made the playoffs.

'Astro-Rama'lands in Schenle Plaa

by Alex Avakian
Staff Writer

Iast Friday, a UFO tumbled from
the sky and crashed near the outskirts
of Schenley Plaza. The silver disk-
shaped spaceship was quickly en-
shrouded by yellow tape, and mysteri-
ous agents dressed in black suits kept
passersby at bay, offering only vague
explanations as to what was  on.

Despite what the odd men in black
claimed, they were not “ﬁxing a pot-
hole,” or  to a “crashed weather

~ balloon.”

‘ ‘I didn’t believe anything they said,’ ’
said Pitt alumna and Squonk Opera di-
rectorjackie Dempsey “It seems like a
big cover—up”

But don’t worry: It is indeed all
just a cover—up for Squonk Opera’s
live musicalasingingaiancing-light—up
extravaganza show, “1’rstro—Rama.”

‘Y\stro—Rama” is a multimedia con-
cert, with live, original music accompa-
nied by lasers and other visual stimuli.
The show portrays  out a mes-
sage about mankind to aliens in an at-
tempt to elicit a response.

Dempsey also claimed that there

would be an opportunity to participate
in the message if audience members
bring their cell phones

“I think it’ll be pretty spectacular,”
saidDempsey.“IthinkitwillbeﬁJnny,a
little  at times, a littie serious at times
If people want to participate in both
composing and broadcasting a mes-
sage about humanity to the cosmos, I
think they should come. It should be
a wonderful w to spend the 
especid y in this beautiful park”

Inside the fictitious alien ship,

Dempsey found blueprints for a huge V

satellite dish, which is assumed to be
able to broadcast messages to aliens
and the rest of the cosmos.

“Sowe thoughtthey’re tellingus to
build this, so we built itin a couple other
cities, and we’vesent a couple messages
out to the universe We haven’t heard

anythingbackyet,butmaybeinPitts— V

burgh we will,” said Dempsey.

Dempsey is a Pittsburgh native jg,

from Plum Borough She received her
undergrad in music from Pitt in 1988.
About half of the ensemble received

Pulitzer Prize-winning poet comes to Pittsburgh

A Pulitzer Prize—winning poet
will bring his rhymes and prose to
Pittsburgh tonight.

“If you have a poem on the
page, that’s not the poem,” said
Dr. Samuel Hazo, founder and di-
rector of the International Poetry
Forum. “The poem is not until
you hear it.”

To kick off the IPF’s 2008-09
performance season, Hazo invited
Paul Muldoon, from County Ar-
magh, Northern Ireland, to read
his poetry tonight.

Currently a professor at Princ-
eton University and a poetry edi-
tor for The New Yorker, Muldoon
worked as a radio and television
producer for the BBC before mov-
ing to the United States in 1987.

Muldoon has published 10 col-
lections of poetry, which include
his 2002 » collection “Moy Sand
and Gravel,” for which he won
the 2003 Pulitzer Prize. His most
recent collection is “Horse Lati-
tudes,” which he released in 2006.

Muldoon’s work centers around
a playful exploration of the English
language. From twisted rhymes to
unusual synonyms, Muldoon ﬁnds
surprising ways to manipulate the
elements of language within tradi-
tional poetic forms, from the son-
net to the sestina. Muldoon also
mixes history, often from his own
Irish heritage, with the contempo-

rary moment to create poems that
transcend time.

At times, Muldoon’s literary
and historical allusions seem ob-
scure, and his complex interest in
the etymology of words can seem
daunting.

“I ﬁnd [Muldoon’s] work diffi-
cult,” said Hazo. “I’m hoping his
particular charm as an Irishman
comes across [in his reading], and
I hear that it does. Some of his po-
ems are not readily apprehensible
to the ear upon hearing them, or
at least I ﬁnd them so. I want to be
proved wrong.”

Muldoon’s success at inter-
weaving the personal narratives
of something as minute as a word
into the general collective history
makes his work an intensely re-
warding experience.

The IPF hosted more than

800 poets and performers from
38 countries in the past 42 years.
Distinguished and diverse po-
ets and performers, such as John
Updike, Naomi Shihab Nye, Prin-
cess Grace of Monaco, Tennessee
Williams, Gwendolyn Brooks and
John Berryman, all performed for
the IPF.

A comment Hazo recalls
making when he introduced the
poet WH. Auden at a reading
at Duquesne University in 1966
sparked the idea for the IPF.

“I said it would be a wonderful
thing if we had a forum in this city
that could introduce poets to the
public and not just students and
teachers,” said Hazo.

The next day, then-president
of the A.\X/. Mellon Educational
and Charitable Trust, Ted Hazlett,
called Hazo and suggested that

they try to start a poetry forum in
the city.

Although at ﬁrst unsure how
successful the IPF would be, Hazo
said that the performances were
soon so popular that people were
turned away and the IPF had to
schedule afternoon readings, in
addition to the initial evening read-
ings.

Hazo credits the popularity of
the live poetry reading in the ’60s,
when he founded the IPF, to the
beat poets who gave public read-
ings in San Francisco at a time
marked by such occurrences as the
Kennedy election.

‘‘\When the poetry forum began,
there was an audience out there in
waiting,” said Hazo. “It just had to
have a focus, so we were fortunate.
It wasn’t planned that way. It’s just
a question of serendipity.”

International Poetry Forum hosts famous poet  

Muldoon, page 8

Hazo also said that the poetry forum
played a role in the development of Pitts-
burgh’s poetry performance ‘scene, which
now offers a wide selection of readings. A

“There are poetry readings now, and it’s
no big deal,” said Hazo. “I think that’s the
way it ought to be. Poetry readings are suc-
cessful when it’s regarded as no big deal.”

When choosing poets to read for the IPF,
Hazo said that a poet must be published and

appreciate the importance of public read-

1983-

“You choose the ones that take poetry
readings .in public seriously,” said Hazo,
“the ones that are good on paper and that

- look upon reading to an audience as a fulﬁll-

ment of what writing a poem is in the first
place.” ’

Hazo said that the best poems are impos-
sible to forget As expressions of the heart,

. he said, poems also make intimate moments

memorable. _
“How many people do you know who
know how to say thank you? That’s a poetic

moment to be able to say thank you,” said
Hazo.
It is important to create a space in public

, speech for poetry by reciting it aloud, Hazo

said, because poetry operates on a differ-

ent level from the language of information, ’

which operates on fact.
“Poetry should have a place in public
speech,” said Hazo. “Poetry is an important

part of public speech. Otherwise, what are ‘
' you left with? You’re left with prose, adver-

tising, swearing, gossip and that’s about it.”

Murray's knee 1

still a problem

by Kyle Craig
For T /ze Pitt New

Pitt weak side linebacker Shane
Murray is not listed on Pitt’s two-deep
roster heading into the Panthers’ Sat-
urday game against Navy.

Murray, a redshirt junior, started
every game for the Panthers last sea-
son and was expected to retain his
starting status before  his knee
during the last week of preseason
training camp in August He’s strug-
gled to return to the field since then.

After playing sparingly against
Syracuse and remaining on the side-
line last game against South Florida,
the remainder of Murray’s season
seems to be in doubt. Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt said on Monday that Mur-
ray’s knee hasn’t progressed enough to
allow him to  his starting role.

‘‘\We’re in the process of reevaluat-
ing exactly what we’re  to do,”
said Wannstedt “He practiced all of
last week, and  knee] is just not

where it needs to be, unfortunately.”

Fifth-year senior Austin Ransom
will continue to replace Murray. Ran-
sorn, a former special teams standout,
converted from wide receiver to line-
backer after Murray/s absence revealed
a lack of depth at the position.

The Panthers are  their
two starting outside linebackers from
last season because of injuries Strong

the rest of the season after breaking

Pitt leading conference
with tough defensive play

Football, page 13

e1 to Navy (4-2) this weekend, they’ll
be  off with the runner-up on
both of those lists The Midshipmen
average 26.5 penalty yards per game
and 3.3 penalties per game

Wannstedt gave Navy credit for
having players with a tremendous
amount of discipline

“[Navy puts] a lot of pressure on
you, [and] they don’t make many mis-
takes,” said Wannstedt.

Learningﬁomlastyear

Pitt fell to Navy last season in
overtime at Heinz Field, 48-45. Much
like this season, the Panthers had a
bye week to prepare for Navy’s un-
conventional triple-option offense.
This time around, Pitt hopes that a
bye week, combined with last season’s
experience, will lead to a better result

Pitt linebacker Scott McKillop
said the team’s attitude heading into
thisgamewillbedifferentthanitwas

last year.

“It didn’t really seem like it was as
effective as we would have liked it to
be,” said McKillop of last year’s bye
week “I think our mentality coming
into this season is totally different”

The Midshipmen enter Saturday’s
contest ranked third in the nation
in  offense, averaging 313.5
rushing yards per game Their triple-
option offense is designed to confuse
opposing defenses, while spreading
 attempts around between the
fullback, the quarterback and the slot
backs '

Even though Pitt will look to
contain that  attack, the Pan-
thers are also wary of Navy’s ability
to throw the ball in key situations In
their last meeting, Navy quarterback
Kaipo—Noa Kaheaku—Enhada com-
pleted only nine passes, but two of
those completions were touchdowns.

“[Navy] beat us by  the
ball. That was the most disappointing

office. salt! as e ulp 

 

thing to me,” said Wannstedt “They
are a more capable passing team than
anyone  them credit for.”
Slowing down such an unpredict-
able offense presents a difficult task

V for any defense, but McKillop said he

welcomes the opportunity to make
up for last season’s defeat

“It’s a challenge that I know my-
self and the defense is looking for-
ward to—to answer the test thatwe
didn’t last year,’ ’ said McKillop.

Prominent pass rush

The Panthers are averaging 3.4
sacks per game through ﬁve games, a
number that ranks sixth in the nation
and ﬁrst in the Big East. That average
might be reduced by next week, how-
ever, because Navy’s offensive style
doesn’t allow many sack opportuni-
ties The Midshipmen are only 
up one sack per game, a mark that
ranks 16th in the nation.

Cross country competes at CMU Invitational

by Adam Littman
Se/zio/‘ Stttﬂ W/ritcr

The Pitt women’s cross country team
didn’t have to travel far to compete this past
weekend, as it trekked up to Schenley Park to
race in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational.

The Panthers ﬁnished 10th overall out of
14 competing teams, with a time of 1250:1539.
The men didn’t compete at last Saturday’s
race.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania took
home a ﬁrst place ﬁnish in the team event for
a second straight year, ﬁnishing the 5k race in

a combined time of 1238:3335. The hosting
Tartans won on the men’s side with their com-
bined time of 2;10:31.21.

More than 150 rurmers competed on both
the men’s and women’s sides of the race; and
the Panthers had eight runners ﬁnish in the
top 100.

Senior Melissa Vignetti had the best time
by a Pitt runner, ﬁnishing the race in 20:34.39,
which placed her 27th. Sophomore Heather
Calisto was the next Panther to cross the ﬁnish
line. Her time of 22:00.96 placed her 61 st

The third Pitt runner to ﬁnish the race
was senior Gizelle Joshua, who ﬁnished in

22:15.50, putting her 68th.

Liz Stern of CMU ﬁnished with the top
time in the women’s race by crossing the ﬁnish
line in 18:51.90.

Alida Lichvar, Carrie Mavrikis, Prachi

Gupta, Janene Adams and Kari Hedderick 

were the other Panthers to ﬁnish in the top
100. Thirteen other Pitt runners joined them
in the race.

Next up for the Panthers is a trip to Dela-
ware to participate in the Delaware Alumni In-

vitational next Saturday. Pitt will travel to New 

York for the Big East Championships the fol-
lowing weekend.
