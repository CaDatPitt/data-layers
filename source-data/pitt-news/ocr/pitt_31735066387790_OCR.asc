UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Jim Tezak

V Asst. News Editor

New Internal Revenue Service
laws now require that the
University of Pittsburgh release
salary information about top
ofﬁcials and administrators, with
some surprising results.

At least seven people employed
at Pitt earn, more than Pitt
President Wesley W. Posvar. Most
of these are members of the
medical faculty.

The IRS requires that private,
non-proﬁt institutions, such as
Pitt, report the salaries of
administrative officers and the
ﬁve highest paid employees.

That list includes James H.
Herndon, professor and chairman
of orthopedic surgery, whose
$390,000 annual salary is the
highest at Pitt and more than
double that of Posvar’s. All five of
Pitt’s highest salaried employees
make over $100,000 more than
the university president.

“It just happens that the top
five employees are not members

of the administration, but
members of the medical faculty,”
said Pitt Executive Vice President
Jack B. Freeman.

According to Freeman, this is
not unusual. Top medical,
administrators and surgeons earn
the highest salaries at most major
research institutions. Freeman
also said that there might be
other faculty members who make
more money than Posvar.

“I would assume that there are
more than seven. 1 don’t know
whether there are more than
seven or not. We are required to
report only the ﬁve highest,”
Freeman said.

In addition, Freeman said that
up to ninety—three percent of of
the salaries for clinical faculty
come from private practice.

“Much of the income they get
is income they generate from the
private practice of medicine,” he
said. “It also needs to be said that
in the cases of these people,
these faculty members generate
a great deal more money for the
university than they receive back

in salary. They make contributions
back to the School of Medicine to
cover departmental costs for
research and teaching.”

Freeman added that most
members of the medical faculty
could as much as double their
annual salary if they worked only
in private industry.

“When you’re in private
practice, you keep all of the
income you generate; in the
academic practice, you keep only
a portion of it,” Freeman said.

According to Freeman,
members of the administration,
except for Posvar, get the same
benefits as faculty members. The
university has set up a special
non-vested, deferred tax plan that
Posvar can place part of his salary
into.

However, Posvar has no rights
to the money paid into the plan.
It is owned by the university and
, unlike normal tax shelters for
faculty, Pitt does not have to give
the money to Posvar when he
retires.

Freeman also stated that the

part of Pitt's effort to "Celebrate Diversity."

VOLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE NINE

Pitt administrators earn higher salaries than Po svar

actual taxable pay most
administrators receive may be
less than what is released, because
faculty members may place up to
eight percent of their annual base
salary into tax-sheltered annuities
programs. They don’t receive this
money until they retire.

Salary information from other
members of the Association of
American Universities, which,
according to a report filed to the
University Senate, consists of the
55 largest and most prestigious
research universities in the
country, shows that, while few
Pitt administrators rank near the
very top of the salary scale, almost
all have higher salaries than their
counterparts at other institutions.

According to Freeman, it is
hard to compare the salaries of
ofﬁcials from different universities
because no two jobs at separate
schools are the same.

“I don't know of any official at
another school who has the exact
same duties that I do,” he said.

He also said that other factors,
such as seniority and job

qualifications, go into determining
an individual’s salary.

While Pitt’s top administrators
are receiving above-average
salaries, faculty wages remain
below the AAU average. That
gap is continuing to widen,
according to a report presented
to the University Senate Council

by the Joint Faculty/
Administrative Committee on
Salary Policy.

“That is a gross comparison of
average salaries of faculty. It
doesn't identify individuals.
Administrators, who hold these
highly responsible positions are
not average; they are probably
pretty outstanding. In that sense,
they ought to be compared to the
outstanding members of the
faculty, in terms of their salaries
relative to those of other
institutions,” Freeman said.

The report noted that, despite
a conscious effort by academic
administrators to improve faculty
salaries, other AAU institutions
raised the average salaries of their
faculty even more.

Chinese memorial held

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

The dead of Beijing’s June 3
Tiananmen Square massacre were
memorialized, and their pro-
democracy struggle supported,
in a seminar last night, held in the
Wherrett Room of Carnegie
Mellon University’s Skibo
Building by the Chinese Students
and Scholars Friendship
Association.

Laurence Glasco, a University
of Pittsburgh history professor
who was in Beijing from May 4 to
June 7, recounted the night of
June 3 which he spent in a
telephone and telegraph building
close to T iananmen Square. At
midnight he watched as tanks
rolled by and demolished the
barricade erected by the student
activists. Later, for about two
hours, trucks carrying soldiers of
the People’s Army stopped on
the street, and soldiers shot into
the nearby crowd.

Glasco remembered that prior
to the arrival of the soldiers, the
crowd had assumed that the
gunfire that could be heard
coming from the west was the
sound of rubber bullets being
shot.

“And then, a man came running
up with a huge slug, a huge
bullet, in his hand saying
something in Chinese that must
have [meant] something like: ‘Do
you see this? Can you believe it?
This is what they’re shooting at
us! Can you see how big this

thing is? This is horrible!’ And
people began -passing it around
with their mouths open and their
eyes wide open and the mood
turned quickly to absolute anger,
and rage, not fear.

. “And then the troops began to
come, and they were shooting
live ammunition.”

The soldiers used machine guns
and according to Glasco, “with
the crowds that thick, every bullet
hit something.”

He claimed to have seen about
50 people carried away on
stretchers and bicycles.

“Our brothers and sisters have
sacrificed their precious lives for
democracy, for equality, for
human rights and for the future
of our country,” said Hong Yan,
president of the CMU division of
the Chinese Graduate Students
Organization, who spoke first in
the program.

“We cannot and will not forget
them,”,he said. “All people will
remember them. Our country
will remember them. This world
will remember them, and history
will remember them.”

Yan called for a moment of
silence in memory of those killed
in the massacre.

Hanging on the speaker's
podium, a ﬂowered wreath
painted with a Chinese ideograph
signifying respect for the dead
underscored the sentiment.

Larry Chang, a Pitt chemistry
graduate student, spoke of the

Pitt prof publishes political piece

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

Pitt communications professor
Theodore Windt is currently
putting the ﬁnal touches on a
new book, which, when
published, will join the ever-
growing deluge of volumes
recently written on the '60s.

“The book deals with the
presidents and political
movements of the sixties,” said
Windt. “It follows the political
movements from their beginnings
with their original protestors

_ through their ideological and
rhetorical changes.”

The book, titled Presidentsandi

Pmtestors: Political Rhetoric in
the 19605, is scheduled for
publication next fall by the
University of Alabama Press.
Presidents will be his first book
since 1983, when he compiled
and narrated an anthology on
presidential rhetoric.
According to Windt,
“contemporary political rhetoric,”

has become quite a popular topic
in recent years, and the
competition among those who
write about it has intensiﬁed.

“I, myself, don't necessarily feel
any more competitive, but there
are more writers out there than
ever before,” said Windt.

Windt attributes the increasing
popularity of contemporary
political rhetoric to the “rise of
the rhetorical presidency. We
expect the’ president to give
speeches and that's become one
standard by which we judge
presidential performance."

Windt said he believes speeches
have become very important in
presidential politics for three
reasons:

First, because of the occurrence
in the last two decades of “activist
presidents,” those who were
elected because of public support
for their campaign platform,
which the American people want
to see him adhere to once in
office. A second reason is because

of the growth in the mass media.

Lastly, Windt attributes the
importance of speeches to the
campaign techniques used by
today's presidential candidates.
“They have almost perfected them
to a science," he said.

Windt, in his new book, will hincd in stories of Photograph

address the Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon administrations.

“I'm now in the position [in my
life] to look back on that decade
of resounding rhetoric," he said.
He has also conceded that a lot of
others, who at the same stage in
their lives and careers as himself,
are also in that position. .

“It happens with every
generation,” he said, “because 20
years later they are in the position
where they can write about it.

“They have the distance to
reﬂect on what [those times] meant
to their adult life.”

Political czctiz/ists ”crz/rise turf’ to encourage social cbomge

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

They begin their work in a_
huddle, armed with clipboards
and ballpoint pens outside a
Mercury Caprice station wagon,
with a hearty battle cry of “One,
two, three, aangb!”

They are political activists,
professional canvassers for
Pittsburgh’s Pennsylvania Citizen
Action.

“‘Aarrgh’ is our battle cry,’_’ field
manager Louis Stiehm said during
the canvas meeting.

Their mission is to gain
immediate support for pro-
consumer legislation by knocking
on the doors of Pittsburghers.

Their backgrounds are as varied
as the neighborhoods they cover,
which range from run-down
houses on the North Side, where
many of the tenants are on
welfare, to what the canvassers
refer to as “The bourg” (short for
bourgeoisie), expansive mansions
in Fox Chapel with manicured
lawns, where hired help answer
the doors.

Using signatures and check
contributions as lobbying tools,
PCA, a non—profit organization
over 110,000 members strong,
has facilitated legislative reform
aimed at protecting the
environment and the consumer
on issues such as toxic waste
clean-up and insurance reform.

, “Life is good,” Sandra Courtney,
canvasing director, said, after

announcing that last week’s
hourly contribution rate was the
best she had seen at the Pittsburgh
office.

Stiehm, who graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh this
past May with a degree in art
history, became involved with
PCA while he was attending the
university. Having seen PCA’s ad
in The Pittsburgh Press, he began
working for them while onbreak
during the summer and between
semesters.

“When I graduated, I realized I
could get into the business world
or give this a shot,” Stiehm said
during ‘one of the canvas
meetings, held in the PCA office
in the Fulton Building (suite 1207)
each day before the canvassers
boldly venture to areas all over
Pittsburgh.

“The notion of sipping
cappuccino and selling art was
attractive to me, but I felt a
responsibility to the community
and to do something for society
as a whole.” F

Stiehm was recently promoted
to field manager after training at
two other Citizen Action -offices,
including a six-week stay in White

Plains, NewYork. He now trains

prospective staff members, drives
the crew car to various “turfs”
and maintains a nightly fund-
raising quota.

Stiehm said that ‘watching
nature shows on public television
as a child piqued his interest in
the environment.

“There is a great need in our
society to do more to protect the
environment and to help the
underclass that I think is being
actively created,” he said. “Rather
than to apply a band—aid, [our
goal isl to fix
major problems, to bring about
a giant qualitative change in
society through legislation and
increasing public awareness.”

Usually in the office by noon
Monday through Friday, to confer
with Sandy Courtney and mark
the day’s maps, Stiehm finishes
his daily responsibilities by 11
p.m., equalling a nine—hour work
day.

on his social life, Stiehm said, “It

“We used to ‘low walk,’ sort of
like ducks, in White Plains while
I was cross-training,” Stiehm
recalled while waddling across
Forbes Avenue. “It took gumption
because there were people sitting
on their front porches that we
had to canvas that night.”

The issue the canvas is currently
working on is establishing a lead
regulatory agency which would
oversee the transport of toxic
waste in Pennsylvania.

Jane Margesson, a senior staff
member, raised $1000 in four
days last week for the
organization.

“In the eight years between
1976 and 1984, Pennsylvania had
more transport—of-chemical
accidents than any other state.
And it was not even close,” Jeff
Blum, executive director for PCA,.
said in an interview with the
Harrisburg Patriot-News.

The first door of the typical
five-hour canvas evening was
answered by a rushed housewife
accompanied by a couple of
sticky-faced children and a
yapping Yorkshire.

After the woman hurriedly
signed the organization’s support
statement and wrote a check
contribution, Stiehm walked
away, chuckling.

and Tracy Clouse
For The Pitt News

The Pitt football team’s first
game abroad will not put any
strain on the university’s normal
athletic budget, according to
Pitt’s athletic director Dr.
Edward E. Bozik.

Bozik said the school will
not exceed its average away
game expense account when
the team meets Rutgers
University at the Emerald Isle
Classic on Dec. 2 in Dublin,
Ireland. Additional costs for
the five-day trip will be covered
by the sponsors of the Classic.

“It’s not costing us anything,”
Bozik said. “I wouldn’t do it
under any other circumstances. "

The sponsors of the Classic
have promised Pitt an advance
sum of money that is larger than
the amount typically guaranteed
to the visiting team in any football
game.

“With the guarantee,” Bozik
said, “we will probably make
slightly more than we would at a
normal away game.”

Dean Billick, associate athletic
director, said the larger advance
guarantee was offered as an extra
incentive to change the location
of the game from Rutgers to
Dublin.

“There had to be reasons to
change the ball game,” Billick
said. “The educational
opportunity was one, and the
financial reward was another."

Arrangements for Pitt's

Panthers’ Ireland trip inexpensive

participation in the Classic were
ﬁnalized injanuary of this year.
Current plans call for the
traveling coaching staff and 75
band members and
cheerleaders to accompany
about 85 players on the trip.
Bozik said that normally 70
players, attend away games.

Bozik hopes that special tour
packages, available through
Forbes Travel and other
university-approved travel
agencies, will draw many Pitt
alumni and Panther fans to the
game.

“You can see a football game
every weekend," he said, “but
this game will offer people an
excuse to go to Ireland at a
relatively inexpensive price.”

Seeking to improve relations
with Eastern Europe, the
University of Pittsburgh has
embarked on a study of the
Borsod County region of Hungary
in correlation with USX Corp.

The effort is being headed by
Dr. Andrew Blair, a professor in
the Katz Graduate School of
Business. The objective will be to
study the effects of modernizing
the area of Miskolc, a steel region
90 miles northeast of Budapest,
in Borsod County, Hungary.

Hungary is in the midst of an
economic reform, changing from
a socialist system to a more
market-oriented economy. Pitt
will be studying _both the
economic and cultural impacts
this transformation will have on
the county.

The university has three
different centers working on the

one of the five Pitt delegates
who, along with two CMU
delegates, went to the

 Association’s national conference

in Chicago on July 28.

The aims of the Association

which was drafted at the July
A conference. The non-violent
promotion of democracy in China
and the coordination of Chinese
student organizations nationwide
are among their goals.
Last night’s seminar, a joint
venture of the CMU and‘ Pitt

V chapters of the Association, was
~"proposed at the national

conference to coincide with the
100th day following the massacre.
The 100th day mourning
ceremony is a Chinese tradition.
The Association is planning an
October 10th march in
Washington D.C., to bring further
attention to the on—going struggle
for democracy in China.
According to Chang, “We’re
trying to reach everyone who

loves peace, freedom and ‘

democracy. [Bringing democracy

Q to China] is going to be a long
struggle and take a lot of effort.”

Stiehm believes that the most

Port Authority Transit announces plansto boost bus fares

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

The Port Authority Transit’s
proposal for a new fare structure,
which calls for an" increase in
fares and elimination of student
U-Tickets,‘ has met little
opposition as the deadline for
public action draws near.

The elimination of U-tickets, a
service that students have been
using for more than a decade,
will affect students from Pitt and
other local schools that use the

' 3 tickets to help defray expensesof

higher education.

PAT encourages the public to .

attend one of two public hearings
on Sept. 14, 1989 at the David
Lawrence Convention Center in
downtown Pittsburgh to express
comment on the proposal.
According to Debbie DeCourcy,
Assistant Manager of Media
Relations, PAT’s Board of
Directors found it necessary to
restructure the current fare system

in order to maintain a balance
between operating costs and
revenue. _

DeCourcy said the proposal
was carefully planned so that it
would increase revenue as well
as provide, the simplest way for
all riders to benefit from
discounted fares. She stressed
that PAT decided to discontinue
the U—Tickets as part of a plan to
consolidate a fare system that
would help the majority of PAT
riders, ’

The proposal calls for
discounted zone one tickets in
books of ten for $10.00. This
would enable ticket holders to
continue paying $1.00 for each
ride. A zone charge increase of
15 to 25 cents is proposed for
zones two through four and 50
cents for zone ﬁve. A weekly
pass priced at $950 will replace
the weekly permit. This change
will eliminate the need to pay an
additional 10 cents for each ride.

DeCourcy said that since 80

  byJoe Martin

percent of PAT’s "riders are zone-
one riders, it will be to their
benefit to use the new zone—one
passes.

Also, PAT plans to use multi-
zone monthly and weekly passes
that will eliminate the need for
additional zone charges. Transfers
are proposed to remain at 25
cents.

“The whole goal of restructuring
is to make a simple transition that
will benefit all [of] our riders,”
DeCourcy said.

The pamphlet states that the
new fare system calls for a
“modest” increase of cash fares.
However, it says that “the majority
of PAT riders can avoid the higher
fares by buying PAT tickets or
passes in advance.”

“I want people to become as
familiar as possible with the
discounted fares being instituted.
A lot of time and effort went in to
planning the proposal. It was
designed to give frequent riders
greater discounts,” DeCourcy

added.

DeCourcy also said the Board
Of Directors decided to eliminate
the U-Tickets because only 1
percent of PAT riders were
benefitting from them.

“lThe U-Tickets] were a nice
discount for students. However,
it will be better that 80 percent of
our riders benefit from discount
passes instead of 1 percent,"
DeCourcy said.

If passed, the proposal will not
take effect until January 1990,
although the ﬁnal decision to
implement it will take place during
the Board of Directors meeting in

I October. A

Glenn A. Walsh, a former
member of the Allegheny County
Transit Council, a consumer
advisory body which advises the
PAT Board of Directors, said he
feels it is unfair for students to
pay more than they have been
paying for public transportation.

Walsh feels that PAT_ should
acknowledge the fact that U-
Tickets are ‘necessary because
there is a legitimate need for
students to have discounted fares
available to them. He also
encourages students to attend
the public hearing and submit
oral or written comments on the
fare proposal .

“I will be 9 presenting oral
testimony at the hearing. If
students and colleges, who will
be directly affected, do not testify,

the PAT Board of Directors will
assume they do not care —— and
PAT will act accordingly,” Walsh
said

Based on information gathered
from ﬁve of six informal meetings
held by PAT in area communities,
the following number of people
attended the meetings : Ingram,
six people; Ross Township, two
people; East Liberty, six people;
Castle Shannon, two people;
Munhall, one person.

The following reactions in
regard to the proposal have been
expressed by Pitt students:

“I wonder if this [increase] is
actually due to increased
operating costs, or are we paying
for ﬁscal mismanagement,” said
Clayton’ Jones, a sophomore
majoring in film studies.

Senior Barbara Moore said

that, A “as a working, full-time‘

student, the elimination of U-

Tickets increases my
transportation cost by ﬁfty cents
each school/working day.

“I was under the impression
that that monthly pass holders
would no longer pay a cash drop
when leaving the downtown
zone. Not true, so what’s the

increase for? — symphony music -

in the subway? —-—— idle labor on
the Fifth Avenue bus lane? ———-
pictures on my pass?” asked
sophomore David Vachon.

High school dropout
rates subject of lecture

By Jim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

The director of the Yale Child
Study Center's School
Development Program will be
the opening speaker for the
Ninth Biennial Paul H. Masoner
School of Education Lecture on
Friday, Sept. 15, from 8:30 a.m.
to noon, in David Lawrence
Auditorium. ~

The lecture by child
psychiatrist James P. Comer
entitled, “Students at Risk and
the 21st Century,” will be the
first in a six-month series of “at-
risk” programs to be sponsored
by the School of Education.

The lecture series is designed
to examine causes of increased
dropout rates among high
school students. Comer’s
address will provide an
overview of the entire lecture
series, according to Thomas J.
La Belle, dean of Pitt’s School
of Education.

According to La Belle, nearly
one out of every four high
school students in the nation
fails to graduate. In some inner
cities that ratio rises to almost
one in two.

“[The number of] youngsters
who are at risk of not graduating
from high school [is]

La Belle cited several major
areas that need to be addressed
to solve this problem. These
areas include school
restructuring, parental
involvement, interaction
between school and
communities, early childhood
education "and mentoring.
These topics will be discussed
individually in five other
forums.

“This is a great way for the
university to interact with the
community and help address
these issues,” La Belle _said.

Following Comer’s opening
speech, a ro_und-table
discussion and question-and-
answer session will be held
between members of the
audience and a panel of five
experts. Each panel member is
an expert in one of the areas to
be discussed at later lectures.

Comer, who also serves as
the associate dean of the Yale
School of Medicine, has
published several books on his
work in race relations, child-
rearing and efforts to improve
irmer-city, low-income schools.
In addition, he publishes a
monthly medical and
psychiatric column in Parents
magazine.

  Physical Fitness:
A thing of the past at Pitt

Everywhere you look these days, there are signs of
Americas physical fitness craze.

This is one of a few trends that should be applauded. For
years Americans have been overweight and out of shape,
and now they are beginning to realize that staying in
shape is good for the body and the mind.

However, Pitt doesn’t seem to feel that fitness is
important for students, faculty or alumni. Starting in the
winter term, approximately 18 physical education classes
will no longer be offered, including such popular courses
as self-defense, aerobics, skiing, sailing and backpacking.

In the past, these courses have been offered only by
forcing the students to pay a fee, in addition to tuition, in
order to pay the instructors of these courses. Students
were complaining about the added costs, and under-
standably so. I

According to Richard Bradshaw, coordinator of basic in-
struction, “We are losing almost one-third of what we
offered before, and [the College of General Studies] is
losing between 80 and 90 percent.” Bradshaw has been

unsuccessful at his attempts to get a new budget passed a

by Dr. Kenneth Metz, the dean of the School ofEducation.
Dr. Metz was in a meeting and unavailable to shed some
light as to why the proposed budget cannot be passed.
The loss of these classes are not the only problems with
-the athletic facilities at Pitt. Anyone who has tried to use
the weight room at Trees Hall knows that" it can be
frustrating and nearly impossible to work out there.

Another area that is severely lacking is the ‘intramural
program. The Department of Health and Physical Educa-
tion has been trying for years tolexpand on this program
and to improve the weight training facilities, but to no
avail.

Students have complained long enough about the lack
of good facilities. Now it is time to do something about it.
The only way that these classes can be saved is for the
students and faculty to let the university know that
athletics (other than the varsity sports) are important to

, them. In order to keep these courses available, the current

budget for the physical education department needs to be

raised by $70,000. Since no increase was approved for this '

year, the courses will be cut — that is definite.

With the money that Pitt spends on improvements every
year —— not to mention the money currently being spent
on a new athletic facility for the athletes, $70,000 is not all
that much. Obviously the university does not realize just
how many budding bodybuilders and olympic skiers
there are out there. They may only be one-credit courses

to Pitt, but they offer firm bodies, good health and peace
of mind to us.

. - Q . \ ‘ ,§‘~

 
 

The environment...
Problems must be tczleen seriously ,

The world may be on the
brink of a major global ecological
catastrophe. These are not the
predictions of fanatical, liberal
Green—peacers, but rather the
cautious urgings of the nation's

, mostrespected scientists.

“We need to face up to the
fact that something enormous
may be happening to our world.
Our species may be up against
some immovable limits on the
combustion of fossil fuels and
damage to ecosystems,” says
William Ruckelshaus, former
administrator of the EPA under

the Reagan administration.

The problem with getting
Washington, D.C. to heed this
warning is that the ecological
effects of global pollution are
subtle, incremental, and delayed.
Unlike the rapid clearing of a
forest, the damage from pollut-
ants, such as acid rain, may
manifest slowly, perhaps over a
period of decades.

One example is the effect of
carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide
is a very important greenhouse
gas: it traps the heat of the sun
near the earth’s surface. Without
it, the earth would be a cool zero
degrees Fahrenheit; too much
and the earth would become too
hot for life.

Every animal exhales carbon
dioxide, and every plant trans-
forms carbon dioxide into fibrous
and starchy building material; but
unfortunately, for the last three

 

hundred years, human beings
have artiﬁcially dumped millions
of to.ns of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere by lpurning fossil
fuels. So far, this ,has increased
levels by a mere 2'5 percent.
But if the present rate of
fossil fuel consumption contin-
ues, carbon dioxide levels will
double before 2050 to a level not
seen in the past 160,000 years,
thus contributing to an average
global warming of perhaps five
to 10 degrees Fahrenheit The
resulting climate change would
shift the breadbasket of the United
States northward from Iowa to
North Dakota, perhaps even to
Canada. 0
Carbon dioxide, of course, is
not the only danger. Ozone is
destroyed by chloroﬂuorocarbon
emissions,‘ a fancy term for the
stuff in aerosol sprays and air
conditioners. The ozone layer is
essential because it blocks out
harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Paul Cfutzen, director of the
air chemistry division of the Max
Plank Institute in West Germany,
says ‘-‘even if chloroﬂuorocarbon
emissions stopped today, chemi-
cal reactions causing the destruc-
tion of stratospheric ozone would
continue for at least a century.”
It is not known how much
pollution is enough ‘to destroy all
the ozone in the atmosphere, the
quantity already produced may
be sufficient. Nor is it known
exactly how much warming will
occur because of the buildup of
carbon dioxide or the precise
effect on the world's agriculture.
These problems of ozone
depletion and warming are
.compounded by a plethora of
other environmental problems:
inefficient land management,
resulting in the loss of fertile
topsoil through soil erosion; the
dumping of sewage, toxic and
nuclear waste into, rivers and
oceans, which kills and poisons
the Fish we eat; inefficient energy

use, which will culminate in total
petroleum depletion in 40 years;
automobile emissions; acid rain;
deforestation  the list goes on.

Convincing; politicians that
there is a problem is another
story. Politicians argue that‘
merely the potential for catastro-
phe does not warrant long-term
legislative commitment.

That is a fallacy. Many of the
deleterious effects of pollution
are already beginning to mani-
fest themselves in the environ-
ment. Moreover, by the time that

politicians have convincing proof. ..

the environment may be beyon C
repair.‘

And, if politicians do opt for
prevention, what is the harm in
extra caution? Are we going to
gamble with the delicate ecologi-
cal balance? Are we going to wait
until it is too late and listen to
scientists say, “I told you so” ?

Politicians err frequently, but
this time they should err on the
side of caution. The consequences

of environmental collapse are too’

great to risk any other course of
action.

THE PI'l'I' NEWS, Wednesday, September 13, 1989

If a man stood up and told a
crowd that he thought religion
was a farce, a disgrace — in
America, would he have the free-
dom to do that?

If a man thought that the coun-
try was declining, that the na-
tion’s political Values were mor-
ally lacking —— in America, would
he be able to express his thoughts
without fear of punishment b
the law? . '

If a man lived an alternative
lifestyle, such as homosexuality,
and wished to try to communi-
cate his perceptions artistically,
would our government support
his attempt?

Increasingly, the answers to
these three questions are the same
— no. ,

The National Endowment for
the Arts is a governmental or-
ganization devoted to the en-
couragement of growth in the
arts in the United States.- This
year, the House of Representa-
tives voted to penalize the group
for funding exhibits that the House
found objectionable.

The exhibits in question were a
“mixed media” piece that con-
sisted of a crucifix submerged in
urine (artist —— Andres Serrano)
and a series of photographs that

Cries of outrage have been
voiced throughout the U.S. Sen-
ate over a few “art” exhibits
funded by the National Endow-

"rnent'f‘or‘ the Arts (NEA).

One of the artists under fire by
the Senate is Robert Mapple-
thorpe. This modern—day Picasso-
of-the-perverted produced two
vile exhibits which have been
described by Time magazine as
“sadomasochistic and ho-
moerotic.” One of Mapplethorpe’s
wonderful creations features a

-:3. photograph of a man urinating

into another man’s mouth; while
in another the shy artist bestows
upon us a picture of himself with
a bull whip shoved up his back-
side. Other works by this artisti-
cally licentious freak, who (big
surprise) recently died of AIDS,
feature naked children in alarm-
ing and perverted poses. Time
stated that “some of Mapple-
thorpe’s work is so graphic that if
authorities had chosen to do so,
they could have prosecuted him
for child pornography.”

Q Another artist that is a bit par-

tial to urine and who has enraged
the Senate is the modern-day
Rembrandt-of-the-restroom
Andres Serrano. This bathroom
bohemian decided to express his

were labeled “homoerotic” (artist
-- the late, great Robert Mapple-
thorpe). The punishment voted
by the House consisted of a
“symbolic” $45,000 cut to the
NEA’s budget. Senator Jesse
Helms has even gone to the ex-
tent of spearheading an attack on
the NEA, proposing a moveto

‘forbid the NEA from underwrit-
ing provocative or controversial

 

exhibits.

This alone is upsetting. The
government, our government at
any rate, was not created to ren-

der moral judgements on relig-

ion, lifestyle and free expression.
In fact, our government was
expressly created with self-im-
posed strictures to prevent it from

euermaking legislative decisions
about these issues.

The protection of our right to
express thoughts freely is not
strictly limited to the spoken and
written word. Expressing a point
of View through visual art is part
of the “freedom of speech” that
we tout so self-righteously to
other nations. But in a nation
where the free exchange of ideas
is so theoretically important, there
are more and more cases in which
the right of the majority to hear
only its own opinions threatens

I to supersede the right of the

individual to communicate freely.
In recent months, there has
been talk of a constitutional
amendment making it illegal to
desecrate the American flag.
While this is primarily directed at
“ﬂag-burners,” there are indica-
tions that the term desecration
could also be applied in cases
such as the Chicago Institute of
Art's controversial exhibit, in
which a ﬂag was spread on the
ground like a carpet and people
were encouraged to walk on it.
In early 1989, a conservative
faction in the state of Arizona
designed and approved, at a state
party convention, a resolution
describing the United States as a

Funding for the arts is vitally needed. . .  

“Christian nation.” To lend cre-
dence to the premise, Sandra
Day O'Connor wrote to the group,
citing supposed legal precedents
that supported the idea.

The government exists to in-
sure that the rights of one person
do not supersede the rights of
another. This applies to things
such as theft, murder, fraud and
other situations where one per-
son impedes another’s right to
property, life, fair employment,
etc. _ V

The government does notexist
to prevent some people from
offending the sensibilities of
others. It does not exist to under-
write the expression of the opin-
ions of only the politically pow-
erful, the rich, or the majority.

When a government is willing
to take action to deter or discour-
age its artists and its thinkers
from expressing views that are
unpopular, it is the beginning of
the end of freedom. We are not
going to wake up tomorrow to
discover that our personal, relig-
ious, sexual and political prefer-
ences have been decided for us.

But art, be it fiction, poetry,
photography, film, painting, or
sculpture, is the most powerful
and far-reaching medium for the

communication of new ideas. The
government is right to encourage
the arts, for art is the single most
powerful forum for thought that
the world has. If art is only en-
couraged when it reﬂects main-
stream ideology, then ideology
stagnates, philosophy dies and
new ways of thinking are still-
born. .
Without exposure to the new,
the daring, even the offensive,
our children will grow up with-
out even being exposed to new
or innovative ways of thinking
and feeling. Taught that America
is sacred, raised in a Christian
nation, surrounded by artistic
depictions of only the mainstream
lifestyle, our children’s children
won’t have the slightest idea that
they do not have to believe in a
Christian god, that they don’t
have to deny their inner sexual-
ity, that they don’t have to love
‘America and everything about it.

Free thought and the expres-
sion of that thought cannot be
denied. A serious attempt to do

so will only result in revolution. A

After all, that’s why we had ours,
even though our government and
our people seem to have forgot-
ten that...

a societyof perverted crackpots, anyway

innerfeelings by creating a sacri-
legious and blasphemous piece
of trash which he titled “Piss-
Christ.” This work of elitist ex-
pression was a photograph of the
Crucifix submerged in a bucket
of Serrano’s urine.

Now, as far as I’m concerned,
these “artists” can create what-
ever they want, but I don’t want
my money paying for it. Senator
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.', has drawn-
up an amendment saying just
that. A

You see, the NBA, 21 1965 leg-
acy of Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great
Society, has a current annual
budget of ‘$170 million. This
money, which they receive via
taxpayers (a.k.a. me and you), is
given out in grants and so forth to
fund the kind of garbage afore-
mentioned. Importantly, the

—Mapplethorpe and Serrano ex-

hibits (which were granted a total
of $45,000 by the NEA) are ex-
ceptions to what the NEA usually

- funds, but the Helm’s amend-

ment is designed to refuse gov-
ernment funding through the NEA
of works found offensive, such
as these. '

‘ Of course, in response to the
Helm’s amendment, arts advo-

cates and liberals have wailed

that almighty liberal rally cry —
“censorship!” (ironically, the other
is “protest!”). Although that word
is hardly accurate, enough spume

 

 

ﬂies from it to cause a total liberal
about face and start them march-
ing. Frankly, anybody who thinks
this is censorship should be hit
over the head with a Webster's

dictionary and a copy of the

Helm’s amendment. The Senate
is not prohibiting these “custodi-
ans of culture” (to borrow a term
from Don Feder) from creating
their vulgar whims and fantasies;
they're merely saying that tax-
payers aren’t going to pay for
them. ' ~

But why shouldn’t the govern-
ment fund any type of art that the

NEA and arts advocates feel they
should? Besides, a liberal or an
arts advocate might not want
their tax money funding SDI or

the “B-2, "while a conservative '

might object to his money going

to welfare. However, unfortu-

nately, all are currently needed to
keep national and international
peace. They are in our vital inter-
est —— Serrano’s “PissChrist” isn’t.
In that respect, I’ve often
wondered why the government,
instead of these elegant elitists
themselves, has to fund this crap.
Is this maybe an indication that
these sicko artists know that they
would be wasting their own
money because no one would
buy their works? Perhaps it would
be a sort of ludicrous and invec-
tive investment? (Yes.)
Furthermore, money aside, the
Helm’s amendment is not a vio-
lation of constitutional rights. The
words “the Federal Government
will subsidize art” are not written
in the Constitution. Uh, uh, --
sorry folks, but the Constitution
has had enough carets added in
the last two centuries. Let’s draw
the line somewhere. If James
Madison and the other great men
that created that fine document
knew that the weirdos in the arts

community were exploiting it to
protect their “right" to have the
government pay for their per-

verted exhibits, they’d probably,

puke. And surely another Ser-
rano might even come along with
an N EA grant, scoop up the vomit
and embark -on his next putrefy-
ing project.

Although past works by classic
artists were often wrongly (from
today's perspective) deemed

socially unacceptable, there’s a"

strong case that the Mapplethorpe
and Serrano exhibits are just that.
Let’s hope that future observers
of their exhibits don’t consider

them representative of our cul-

tural norms, especially since they
were subsidized by our federal
government. The Senate action
will send a prudent message that
they weren't.

Too often the end result of
government-subsidized art is an
indefinite budget at the disposal
of a few weirdos. Although I
don’t favor the concept of the

NEA—- I wouldn’t vote to abolish ‘

it, but merely to install some
moral guidelines into what the
public is paying for——- the Helm’s
amendment will do just fine.

Bus lcmelaelpful to commuters, pedestrians sbould loo/e both ways

This letter is a reply to the
editorial, “Bus Lanes a Threat to
Us All”, which appeared in the

   
 

 

Sept. 5 issue.

The reason we have bus lanes
on Fifth Avenue is because Fifth
Avenue has more [car] lanes than

‘OForbes Avenue. At least ten bus

routes go through Oakland. Since
Fifth Avenue is the major road in

Oakland, it is common sense that
most of the buses use it.

The editorial tries to use a man’s
death in a bus accident as evi-
dence that the bus lane is danger-
ous. My question is this: If the bus
lane were permanently elimi-
nated, just how would that im-
prove safety? Couldn't a pedes-
trian be struck by a vehicle trav-
eling inbound just as easily?

The editorial states that lately,
buses have been using Forbes

Avenue to travel outbound and
asks, “What is wrong with this
arrangement?” Clearly, the au-
thor has never tried to go from
downtown to Oakland by bus
lately, or he/she would know
exactly what is wrong with it.
Adding ten bus routes to the
already overcrowded lanes of
Forbes Avenue has made it even
more hazardous than usual. In
addition, the traveling time is
nearly doubled. Why should the

safety of Forbes Avenue drivers
and pedestrians be jeopardized
so that Fifth Avenue pedestrians
don’t have to bother looking both
ways before crossing?

The editorial states, “Oakland
is not busy enough to warrant the
presence of a bus lane.” Wrong.
Several recent newspaper articles
have reported that with the ex-
ceptions of downtown Pittsburgh
and downtown Philadelphia,

Oakland is the most heavily trav-
eled area in Pennsylvania.

While the bus lane is still closed,
I challenge the author of the
editorial to go from downtown to
Oakland on any bus, preferably
during rush hour. Perhaps then
he/she will understand what we
bus commuters must endure
every day.

tested. Only this test is harder
than any ﬁnal or rnid-term ever

SATs, a test Pitt fans can easily
relate to.

The Pirates were showing signs
of being one of the best young
baseball teams in the league
during the 1988 season. Give
them one more year and they’ll

 

believe.

The Pirates took it all right,
people’s high hopes and their
1989 season right down the
proverbial tubes. They are now
sporting a .448 record and seern
to have a lock on second—to—last
place.

O.K., Steeler season is now
upon us. Oh, no. Touchy subject.

The Steeler season seems to be
headed in the same direction as

word seems.-

Pittsburgh fans should ‘keep
the faith a little longer. Sure, the
Steelers deserve to be criticized
for their (enter own joke here)
against Cleveland Sunday, but
they don’t deserve to be given up
on. .

Metropolitan, Orange Bowls part
of football's glorious scrapbooks

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Icy, old Metropolitan Stadium
in Bloomington, Minn., has now
become what it was ultimately
destined to be — a memory. ,

Not, of course, a particularly
pleasant sort when one still aches
from frostbite due to the Arctic
temperatures that once settled
into the Sunday bones of faithful
Minnesota Vikings fans. But
pleasant when the names of
heroic men like Tarkenton,
Foreman and Grant, inhis purple
and yellow tossle cap, and the
once-feared Purple People Eaters
occasionally resurface, along with
vignettes of the proud moments
that these men brought to the old
Met’s confines.

'3? Then the snow and cold doesn’t

really matter after all, for fond
memories are rarely anything
other than warm.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

32 seconds remained on the
Met’s clock, and it was the fourth

quarter of the 1975 playoff
between the Vikings and the
Dallas Cowboys. Roger Staubach
let a desperation heave fly down
the right sideline. Drew Pearson
pushed off Nate Wright and
stumbled into the end zone
holding the football and a
miraculous 17-14 Cowboys’
victory.
Hail Mary, full of grace... _

During the winter months,
nothing would challenge her. The
bitter winds and ﬂying snow as
allies only made her stronger.
Each Sunday Norsemen came
from miles around to witness her
spectacle, but even then only for
a few hours at a time. And the
Vikings’ players simply went into
battle then, went home to their
families — bruised, cold, and
more often than not, victorious.

Exciting games and
championship seasons passed
with the years, but each night,
when the lights were dimmed,
old Metropolitan Stadium stood

by herself, closed her eyes, and
went to sleep, herself a champion
of the winter.

This past summer, at a time‘
when she was most vulnerable,
when the grass. field was its
greenest, they came to tear her
down. Then she was even more
alone. Being the month of June,
the snow and winds, her faithful
bodyguards, weren’t yet around

to protect her. The Vikings, her .

old tenants, had abandoned her
way back in 1982, moving indoors
to a colorless place called the
Metrodome. The fans had been

distracted by the baseball season,
and therefore weren’t paying all
that much attention.

A certain demolition worker,
saddened by the nature of this
particular job, swore he could
still hear the cheers coming from
inside the great structure, even as
she was being ripped apart. He
showed obvious emotion.

But as the wrecking ball swung,
the old Met never made a sound.

Why treat an old, decaying
football stadium with such
reverence? Frank Deford, formerly

I of Sports Illustrated and NBC

Sports, made this observation on
December 21, 1986, as the Miami
Dolphins were preparing to leave
their legendary fortress known as
the Orange Bowl: _
Old baseball stadiums can be

P so distinct in their particular

geometry that we can always
visualize them perfectly. Wrigley
Field. Fenway Park. Yankee
Stadium.
But old football stadiums —
horseshoes, all of them. Bowls.
The troublewith football stadiums
is that they're all shaped like
footballs. So football bowls aren’t
remembered so much for their

own personalityas bystrictly what
happened within the sideline
stripes.

How many of you can «even
remember where the most
importantgamein football history
was played? Well, it was two teams
from up north, but it was right
here, the Orange Bowl.

Can you call up The Morning
Star of your memory? Jan. 12,
1969. Jets 16, Colts 7.

Thank you, Matt Snell.

Thank you Gerry Philbin. Thank
you, Broadway Joe. .

Don Shula was the coach in
that game, Super Bowl III. Of
course, on that occasion, he was
the losing coach, with Baltimore.
He '5 come back to squeeze a lot of
juice out of this big old Orange,
though.

The only undefeated NFL team
there ever was, the Dolphins of
1972. That was Shulais team —_
Griese and Warﬁeld, Csonka and

Kiick, the guys with no names on '

defense.

ext. 8-7881  

* We will be discussing plans for the upcoming year

Only a handful of you
watching, though, will recall that
the Dolphins weren’t the first
professional team to use this as a
home team. There was a club
known as the Miami Seahawks
who played here for one season in
the oldAll-A merican Conference,
just after the war, back when
Florida was some far away place
waiting to be discovered by air
conditioning and Walt Disney.
Actually, the OrangeBowl itself
was created in the early years of
the Depression as a gimmick to
lure yankee dollars down to
Miami over New Years. The first
construction, in 1935, was an
8,000 seat sauces made out of
lumber left over from an
American Legion convention.
"Then, they brought in period
northern powerhouses like
Bucknell and Manhattan to play
the old Suntan U., The University
of Miami.
Luckily, the Orange Bowl
parade was betterthan thegames,

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 13, 1989

and by the end of the 19305,
capacity was up to 38, 000. Then,
they tore down the wooden bowl,
built it back up with metal, and at
last, double decked it in 1948.
TheDolphins moved here in 1966,
and if you ’veforgotten every other
garnethey everplayed, you’ll never
have this one slip your mind:
San Diego versus Miami in the
playoffs, January, 1982. The
Dolphins famous hook and trail
— Strock to Harris to Nathan. But
Kellen Winslow, with 13
recqrtions, carried the Chargers
to exhaustion and a 41 to 38
victory.
And, of course, because it’s
sunny Florida, the wonderful
thing about the Orange Bowl is
that it's always a beautiful day
for a football game'(referring in
jest to the Miami vs. New York,
the 1982 AFC Championship,
which was played in the mud).
Come on down.

 

But now, the Orange Bowl is

going to be turned back strictly to S’

the colleges. When New England
playsMiami here tomorrow night,
it’ll be the end of the Orange for
play for pay. The Dolphins will
begin theirschedule nextsummer
in their own stadium a few miles
up the road from here at the
Broward County line.

It’ll be beautiful enough —— a
hundred million dollars, 73, 000
seats, everyone with a chairback,
luxury boxes, parking for 14, 000
cars, closed-circuit TV and all the
concession stands. All new and
improved.

So I think I 71 take a little of this
Orange Bowl grass fora keepsake

from this old place. In fact, the
only thing the Dolphins’ stadium
won ’t have is ghosts. The ghosts
stay right here atthe OrangeBowl.
The ghosts stay with the place.
[Deford looking to the sky.I Take

it easy, guys.

Q}

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, September 13, 1989 .

 

Bosak

Continued from page 14
I was very surprised to learn of
the attitude Bostonians have of
their Red Sox.

The Boston Herald pretty much
comes right out and says that the
only thing left in the Sox’ season
is to see if Wade Boggs wins
another batting title and if Roger
Clemens returns to his dominating
form.

It’s notjustin the papers. While
watching a Sox/Angels game at a
local pub, a Boston “fan" asked
me the score.

‘‘2-1 California, ninth inning.”

“Figures they’re about to lose.”

Judging from the attitude, you’d
think the Red Sox were in much
worse shape than the Pirates. Is
the Sox season really as lost as
their fans seem to think?

Truth is, Boston is only four
games under .500. That’s all, four
games. Sure, they’re 10 games
out of first, but a .500 season is
nothing to be ashamed of.

Granted, the Sox have been in
the playoff hunt for the last couple
of years, but do their fans expect
that every year? It’s not very
practical if they do. They can
hope for a title every year, but
expecting one is a little too much.

If any fans should be bitter, it

 should be Pirate fans. The Bucs

ended last year 10 games over
.500. A couple of injuries and less
than a year later, they are 15
games under the half-and-half
mark.

But thank goodness the Pirates
fans haven’t stooped the depths
of the Bostonians. Sure they give
the Pirates some razzing, but they
still care about and support their

. Buccos, and they don’t even have
a Boggs or a Clemens to cheer
for.

The big test is to see what they
do with the Steelers. After all, 51
points is pretty damn bad. Will
they give up on the season? I sure

.2? hope not. Half the league is 0-1
now; so the Steelers are tied with
14 other teams. ,

Giving up on the Steelers
already would be like giving up
on Curvin Richards for rushing
for only 43 yards Saturday against
Boston College. People aren’t
going to expect Richards to be
held under 100 yards every game,
so they shouldn’t expect -the
Steelers to get blown out every
game. It’s simply not going to
happen.

So don’t give up already, and if.

I“) they do end up going 0-16,

remember they’re a young team
with a promising future.

What the heck, that’s what
Pittsburghers have had to do with
the Pirates and the Steelers for 10
years now.
