Pitt names new athletic director

Pederson aims for ”l7an-friendly" program

tt Townsend

Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg inaugurated a
new era in Pitt sports yester-
day afternoon by appointing
Steve Pederson director of
athletics, filling a spot left
vacant by Oval Jaynes’ resig-
nation in August.

“This is an extremely
exciting day for" me,”
Pederson said. “I’ve been at
schools with great traditions

[like] Ohio State, Tennessee, '

and Nebraska. Now I have an
opportunity to be at a school
with the greatest of tradi-
tions,” said Pederson.
Pederson wasn't known
to be on the final list of can-
didates, but it was clear that
his track record couldn’t be
overlooked by the selection

committee.

Pederson, 39, is currently
the associate athletic director
at the University of
Nebraska. In 1988, he was
recruiting coordinator for
Ohio State, and in his three
years there he helped rebuild
the Buckeye program into the
powerhouse that it is today.
Then in 1991, he worked
under Johnny Majors as a
recruiting coordinator at
Tennessee. The classes he
helped recruit were regarded
as some of the best in the
country by several publica-
tions.

In his two years at
Nebraska, Pederson raised
$20 million for renovations
to Nebraska’s memorial sta-
dium. He also negotiated a
multimillion-dollar shoe con-
tract and developed the mar-

keting program to expand‘

sales of Nebraska products
across the country.

“Steve Pederson is as
good as they come in every
standpoint,” Majors said.
“The University of
Pittsburgh, as well as any
school in the country, would
be very fortunate to have him
as athletic director. I’m sure
people are going to be able to
look back in five years and
see the improvement in many
Pitt programs. Regardless of
my fortunes, this a great
decision for Pitt.”

Pederson’s main goal is
simply stated. He said he
wants Pitt to return to being
the best program in the Big
East, as well as the top pro-
gram in the eastern part of
the U.S.

Focusmc on His Issues

Part I of 3

Pitt students discuss education,
jobs, the economy, and taxes

Christiane Mul, Jen Aron, 8: Rick ni

The Pitt News held a focus group
on Saturday, Oct. 26, 1996 to discuss
issues relating to the upcoming presi-
dential election. Campus organiza-
tions such as SGB, College
Republicans, University Democrats,
CWO, BAS, and BiGaLA were contact-
ed. Only four students attended. None
were aﬂiliated with these groups.

Over the next three days, The Pitt
News will be reporting the issues dis-
cussed by the students. Today's issues
are jobs and the economy, education,
and taxes.

Higher education provides greater
opportunity for better-paying jobs. The
economy is on the rise, but no matter
who is elected, students will still
worry. The financial limitations from

college costs are making it harder for
many students to further their educa-
tions.

These were the opinions expressed
by the four Pitt students who were a
part of The Pitt News focus group.
They discussed issues facing America
in the Nov. 5 presidential election, and
two of the most important topics dis-
cussed by the students were the econo-
my and jobs.

President Clinton says he has
helped Americans with jobs and the
economy in the past four years. He has
created 10.5 million jobs; unemploy-
ment is down from 7.5 to 5.2 percent,
and he pledges that he will continue
this trend.

Despite this, Bob Dole argues that
Clinton’s policies have hurt small busi-
nesses, as indicated by a record-break-
ing number of bankruptcy filings. He

Soviet nuclear weapons testing

Across the World

NAIROBI, Kenya —- Several small
wars between the Hutus and Tutsis
have broken out in different coun-
tries in Central Africa. Fires are
running through the countries of
Rwanda and Burundi and spreading
to Eastern Zaire.

The wars are occurring
because the Tutsis make up only 14
percent of the population in these
countries, compared to the Hutus
which make up 85 percent of the
country, but the Tutsis hold politi-
cal, economic and military control.
This fight is about class and power
—— not about ethnicity. Associated

MOSCOW —— The United States is
buying a secret study of Soviet
nuclear weapons testing. A group of
Russia’s atomic weapons scientists
agreed to sell first—hand informa-
tion about four decades of Cold War
events.

The purchase will give the
United States insight into Soviet
military and scientific procedures
with its detailed 2,000—page history
of 41 years and 715 nuclear tests.

Joe Kohn makes no apologies for being
a career politician. In fact, Kohn is citing cor-
ruption in the state attorney general’s office as
a reason a non—po1itical ﬁgure should hold the
job as the state’s top lawyer.

Kohn is running against Republican
Mike Fisher on Nov. 5 for the post of
Pemrsylvania’s attomey general, and he is
focusing his campaign on “cleaning up” the
office.

“Four years ago, I said we needed a
practicing attorney, and not a career politi-
cian, as the state’s top law enforcement oﬂi-
cer,” Kohn said. “Now we have a disgraced
attorney general who is in prison.”

Because of this, Kohn said he hopes to
restore integrity to the oﬂice, and plans to
address areas of lobbyist disclosure, term
 and voluntary public ﬁnancing for
candidates.

“I will establish a special, elite public
conuption unit within the attorney general’s
office, just like the federal government has
within the justice department,” Kohn said.

Thethreeprioritiesthattheunitwill
focus on are high—level corruption, election
crimes, and conﬂict of interest crimes.

Kohn also wants to prohibit public oﬁi—
cials and elected oﬂicials from accepting gra-
tuities of any kind ﬁ'orn lobbyists. Under his

 

THE PITT NEWS 3

Candidate wants lobbyists
to face the wrath of Kohn

plan, lobbyists will be required to identify the
policies they are attempting to inﬂuence, and
fully disclose the total amount of resources
they are committing to their lobbying efforts.

According to lobbyists’ reports,
Pennsylvania’s lobbyists spent an average of
$621 in lobbying last year. Kohn said he
thinks the number is too low, and that state
lobbyists are not reporting the actual amount
of money they spend trying to inﬂuence
politicians.

As long as candidates are elected on the
strength of their ﬁnancial contacts instead of
the strength of their ideas, Kohn said the gov-
ernment will never be responsive to the
state’s citizens.

The issue of term limits is also a focus of
»Kohn’s, and he said he thinks there are too
many career politicians that want to live their
lives in Harrisburg.

“I believe in serving the public — not
living off it,” he said. “That is why I support
term limits for all elected officials, not just the
governor, the attorney general, and other row
oﬂicers, but also for state senators and state
representatives. No legislature should stay in
Hanisburg for more than 12 consecutive,
straight years.”

Along with his wife and three children,
Kohn has resided in Chester County, near
Philadelphia, most of his life. He is a gradu-
ate of the University of Pennsylvania and the
Vrllanova Law school.

Breachmenders 

Early on in her stay at Breachrnenders,
Morgan created Job Links, which is a
employment training program providing job
assistance to neighborhood residents.

Those residents who beneﬁt from ser-
vices like Job Links are practically Morgan’s
own neighbors, as she has been living west
Oakland for 21 years.

Morgan was born in Pittsburgh’s Hill
District, but left the area when she was in the
third grade.

“I have lived in Chicago, Texas, and
Florida, but I always spent my summers in
Pittsburgh, “ Morgan said “So I feel like I
never really le ”

Living within walking distance ﬁorn
her oﬁice at Breachrnenders, Morgan said
the best part ofherjob is simply working to
improve her community. -

“I get satisfaction from knowing that
people who live here [in Oakland] can work
here. I also love to see kids in the neighbor-
hood get jobs,” she said.

Before Breachmenders opened in 1980,
Morgan said that her community was in bad
shape.

"The homes were in bad condition. And
it’s been a slow and steady progress over the
years,” Morgan said.

With its own private construction crew,
Breachmenders rehabilitates vacant homes

and provides affordable housing to those in
need.

Bob Malnar, the projects manager and
director of the construction crew at
Breachrnenders, works closely with Morgan
everyday.

“I have only been at Breachrnenders for
arnonth, butlcantrulysaythatscarletisa
great person to work with,” Malnar said

Curtis Mitchell, a carpenter with the
construction crew, has known Morgan long
before she was executive director.

“Scariet mentally prepared herself for
her new position. She had to,” Mitchell said
“But I feel that she is adjusting well, and as
far as Breachmenders goes, I don’t see any-
thing but

The most frustrating aspect of Morgan’s
job is dealing with apathy within the
Pittsburgh area community.

“More people need to stand up for
themselves and protect the quality of their
lives, “Morgan said. “It makes my job ﬁus—
trating when they don’t.”

Morgan manages to keep herself sane
amidst all of the chaos by watching her
efforts create positive results.

“It’s that one small something that
comes along and makes your community
better than the day before,” she said. “That’s
the rewar .”

also says that people should be
able to earn more and keep
more of their earnings.

The problem, according to
some of the students, is that
the higher-paying jobs require
a college education, which is
difficult to afford without a
high-paying job.

“Back in the day, a grade
school education was all that
you needed, and if you went
higher, you had more opportu-
nities,” said independent voter
Therese Tallarico, 20. “Just
like a couple decades ago, if
youhad a high school educa-
tion, you had opportunities,
and if you went to college, you
had more opportunities. Now
it’s up to college-level  but if
you go to even higher educa-
tion, like grad school or law
school, then you have even
higher opportunities.”

Democrat Amanda Keller,
a 20-year-old student from
Philadelphia, agrees with
Tallarico, saying, “I know per-
sonally my opportunities are a
lot greater than my parents’
because I have the opportunity
to go to college.”

Pitt student Thomas
Muldoon, 20, who is also an
independent, disagreed.

“I don’t feel that I have
any more or less opportunities
than my parents did; I just
have to be a little more ﬂexi-
ble,” he said

Independent voter Reem
Horani, a 22-year old mathe-
matics major, said she believes
jobs are being lost rather than

created.

“Technology is a lot dif-
ferent and there are a lot of
issues going on now with
machines and computers tak-
ing jobs away from people,”
she said.

group agreed with Muldoon.

They discussed college-
level education along with
high school education. The
focus group felt that high
school education was impor-
tant because kids need a good,
quality education to go on to
college.

Dole believes that all

“I’d like to see more of a

Muldoon went to private

said. “I am for public schools.

The focus group all had
the same View on who they
would elect according to the
issues. For them, Clinton was
the lesser of two evils.

In a speech on Oct. 27,
Clinton said voters need to
decide to make college educa-
tion available to all. He said
that they have given low-cost
loans to young people so they
can attend college and not go
bankrupt. To all of this, he
said, “Our friends on the other
side opposed it.”

Dole’s web site says, “All
families should have the same
right to choose what school is
best for their children as Bill
Clinton, who blocks such edu-
cation reform __ and sends his
daughter to an exclusive pri-
vate school.”

Education isn’t the only
hot issue during the
Presidential campaign. In his
bid for re-election, President
Clinton is promoting tax-cuts
targeted towards middle-class
families. Bob Dole’s tax plan
-— a 15 percent across-the-
board cut coupled with a 355%
credit for each child under age
18 ——- is the main issue of his
campaign platform.

“[Dole’s] tax cut will just

add to the deficit,”

where Clinton denounced
Dole’s plan as “a dangerous
tax scheme” which would
“weaken our economy.” .Dole
responded to this during sever-
al speeches, reminding voters
that Clinton “imposed the sin-
gle largest tax increase in the
history of America.”

Despite Dole’s argument,
the focus group shared the
view that income taxes should
be reduced. The four students
leaned toward Clinton, refer-
ring to Dole’s tax plan as
“ridiculous” and “impossible.”

The students also shared
Clinton’s positive outlook on
the condition of the economy,
which has grown 3.2 percent
since 1992. “The econo-
my has been on the upswing

since Clinton [was elected],” _

said Tallarico. Keller agreed
the economy was on the
upswing, but argued that the
credit shouldn’t go to the
administration. “It’s a cycle,”
she said.

Horani and Muldoon pre-
ferred not to contrast today’s
economy with the past, as the
candidates so often do. “It’s
not more or less; it’s differ-
ent,” said Horani.

Muldoon added, “We went
from an industrial economy to
service jobs, so you can’t com-
pare,” said Muldoon.

New athletic director to
make Pitt sports happen

Congratulations to Steve Pederson in his appoint-
ment as Pitt’s athletic director. I

We at The Pitt News are anxiously awaiting the
new life that Pederson will inject into Panther sports.
Pederson brings with him the experience he has accu-
mulated as the associate athletic director at the
University of Nebraska, as well as through positions at
Ohio State and‘Tennessee.

Pederson’s plans include making Pitt the best
school competing in the Big East and a top school in
athletics in the eastern part of the U.S. In order to draw
larger crowds to Pitt athletic events, he envisions Pitt’s
athletic department as becoming “fan-friendly.” It’s
about time that someone with vision took the driver’s
seat in the athletic department.

One of Pederson’s first priorities in making Pitt
athletics fan-friendly is to jump-start the construction
of the proposed convocation center. The convocation
center would house the facilities for the basketball
teams as well as practice facilities for each other sports
team and a fitness center. All facilities are to be avail-
able for all students. .

The search‘ for an athletic director was highly com-
petitive, encompassing over 90 people, ranging from
athletic directors at other universities to officials from
major athletic conferences applying for the position.
Pederson stood head and shoulders above the rest.

Nordenberg and football Head Coach Johnny
Majors have both expressed enthusiasm and high hopes
for what Steve Pederson has to offer the University as
its new athletic director. We would like to echo their
sentiments and say that we look forward to seeing the
new direction in which Pederson will lead Pitt athlet-
rcs.

So, once again, congratulations to our new athletic
director. We think you’re just what Pitt athletics have
been looking for.

The ”American sou|” isn't for sale by Nike

  

A few weeks ago, in the illustrious
presidential debates, the moderator
asked a question about how something
would affect the   Bob
Dole, like the quintessential politician
he is, slickly avoided saying anything
concrete. I’ve been wondering what

the term "American soul” actually"

means.
In the tradition of Socrates, I
decided to go annoy the hell out of my
ﬁiends and probe their thoughts. The
ﬁrst few people I asked replied with,
“Well, what do you mean by ‘soul’?”I
had to search for a working deﬁnition.
I pulled out the best piece of dust—gath-
ering decorum in my room, the dictio-
nary my parents gave me. The most
applicable deﬁnition was, “an anirnat—
ing or essential part” or the alternate, “a
man’s moral or emotional nature.”
Both of thesephrases combined tend to
capture the essence of the sentiment.

My colleagues came up with
many different answers -—- some
wacky, some not-so-wacky. Once
someone replied, “If there is an
American soul, it’s probably made by
Nike or Reebok and costs about
$129.95.”

One friend raised the “fast—food
mentality” or what Baby—Boomers
called the “rat race.” It involves the ten-
dency of Americans to saturate our
lives with products of convenience that
give us more time to make money, to
buy more convenience products, to
make more time, etc. McDonald’s, the
microwave, cable, coffee makers, and
washing machines are ‘all perfect
symptoms of this underlying theme.
Unfortunately, the theme does not

 

apply to all Americans..It seems inac-
curate to reduce our. soul to pointless
greed. Itdoes notcaptureourrnoralsor
any of the traditional American ideals
which are still a part of us. However,
this sentiment does blacken our souls a
little.

Another friend said, ‘Maybe the
American soul is akin to the soul of the
wolf.” He meant the group of charac-
teristics which makes a wolf a wolf. A
wolfhuntsinpacks andisasocial
mammal. These characteristics and
others make a wolf a wolf.

The analogy is, “Well, what
makes an American an American?”
We then restricted ourselves solely to
cultural considerations, another dead
end. There are a bunch of majority cul-
turalaspects,butnonethatcapturethe
sentiments of every American.
Frustrated,wetriedtoﬁndonething
that all Americans had in corrmron that
was important enough to call a soul. “It
must be the Constitution.” he said.

Every American lives under or by
the Constitution and in the “democra-
cy” it provides. Not everyone likes it,
but that is part ofthe American soul,
too. In a democracy there will be dis-
sent Itcouldbearguedthatweareno
longer a democracy, and we live under
the shadow of democracy in a totalitar-
ian regime spearheaded by the
wealthy. I think that sentiment will
carry more weight if Bob Dole wins
the election, but for the most part we
are still living in a land where our vote
matters. The Constitution also seems to
reﬂect much of the moral history of the
United States. The Constitutional
theme seems to be the perfect deﬁni-
tion, except for one minor detail.

I think that it is terribly dangerous

to identify a document written 200
years ago with the dynamic, changing
entity of our soul. Many of the original
sentiments capture the status of our
soulatthatpointinhistory.'1herightto
bear anns was basically written into the
Constitution for protection against

marauding and annoying English sol- ,

diers imposing on colonial families.
'Iheproblemwiththisisthatinwor-
shipping the Constitution as a soul, one
tends to lose sight of its original inten-
tions. Thus, oolonial practicality is now
beingtoutedasoneofourmostbasic
rights by groups like the NRA. This is
the danger of such identiﬁcation. The
Constitution is a great guide to what
oursoulwaslikeinthepastbutnotfor
the present and not the future.
Ithinkthebestansweristhatwe
arebetter otfnot deﬁning theAmerican
soul at all, at least not concretely. Every
existing deﬁnition seems to take some-
thing essential away from the senti-
ment. Deep down inside, in the cockles
of our hearts (sony about the Denis

' Leary reference). we know what the

American soul is. In another country,
we can recognize other Americans
with uncanny accuracy, and so can for-
eigners. I was in Canada this summer
and one of my drunken ﬁiends was
talking to a few women outside the bar.

.After seeing his drunken antics, they

said, “You MUST be AMERICAN’ '.
Seriously though, we all have an
idea of the American soul that involves
all these things: freedom. the
Constitution. fast food, drunken antics,
national pride, and national hatred.
Everyone I talked to has a different
idea The idea that matters is your own.

Rosey loves
New York -
lhis week

 

Coming from the suburbs of
Philadelphia, I had been taught by my
parents, grandparents, friends, pets,
you name it, that all New York sports
teams should go to hell.

We had an excuse to rip apart
every team. The New York Rangers? A
bunch of cheap-hitting, blue pansy
smurfs. The Giants? Well, they’re just
punks. And the Jets? Well, at least they
won a game this weekend.

Anyway, being a fan of the Boston
Red Sox as well, there aren’t many
other teams I hate more than the low-
life, scum—sucking New York Yankees.
All the way from the short—tempered
George Steinbrenner to third base-
man/”Benedict Arnold” Wade Boggs
to big-mouthed outfielder Darryl
Strawberry  well, it just doesn’t get
any worse than this.

Except for the Atlanta Braves.

Screw the unwritten rules. At this
very moment, I’m the biggest New
York Yankees fan on Earth.

I never genuinely cheered for a
Gotham City squad in my life until this
weekend, and I’ll never forget the
warm feeling I had Saturday night
when MVP closer John Wetteland put
away Mark Lemke for the final out of
the 1996 season.

And to the majority of
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh students
here at Pitt: I know you’re closet
Yankees fans, too.

The Braves may have been
“America’s Team,” but I’ll bet you that
half of the bandwagon switched sides
on Saturday night.

The city of New York has been
waiting 17 years for this wonderful
season, a season of improbable come-
backs, a season of destiny —— including

Melissa Alpers fired 17 kills, and
Jennie Driscoll led the weekend with

The Panthers (15-8, 5-0 Big East)
struggled early before rebounding
against the Eagles (12-15, 15-5, 15-
11, and 15-7). Driscoll and company
pounded the Lady Friars (15-3, 15-8,

more than 12 kills in one game and
could only put up a .154 kill percent-

one block and three block assists in
addition to her offensive explosion
over the weekend.

“She’s starting to understand the
game,” Assistant Coach Jeff
Belmonte said of Alpers. “Melissa
has a lot going for her and is a great
physical talent.”

Driscoll was unstoppable for the
second weekend in a row. The senior
fired a combined team—high 31 kills
in both games, blocked five shots,
and assisted on six others. She has
been an offensive machine for the
Panthers, responsible for almost 25
percent of the squad’s output in con-
ference play.

Alpers and Driscoll helped Pitt
hold Boston College (12-10, 0-4) to a
.017 attack percentage and 36 spikes
in the match. The visiting Panthers
finished with five players firing at
least five kills or better.

Stephanie Dufresne and
Annemarie Tarara were sensational in
Sunday’s win over Providence (15-
13, 2-3). Tarara killed six shots
through Lady Friar defenders en route
to a .303 kill percentage.

“Steph had probably the best
match of her career this weekend
against Providence,” said Belmonte.

Dufresne took control of the
match in every facet, finishing with
44 assists, seven kills, 12 digs, two
blocks, and three block assists.

Unfortunately, freshman Paula
Zemrowski continues to struggle. The
6-foot—5 hitter mustered a mere nine
kills in seven games this weekend.

There were four cases of heat
stroke among football players that
resulted in death in 1995, the great-
est number since 1978, according to
the National Federation News. They
could have been prevented with the
proper precautions.

The NCAA reported in the fall
1995 edition of Sports Sciences that
football players were permitted to
wear shoulder pads during the three
initial preseason non-contact foot-
ball practices as an injury—preven—
tion measure. Athletic trainers from
New York to Florida expressed con-
cerns about heat illness and a lack of
acclimatization. Other schools
reported that, even with extensive
heat illness prevention measures in
place, 12 instances of IV therapy for
football players occurred in the first

four days of practice. The suggested
cause was the increased heat reten-
tion (and possible increased exer-
tion) associated with the wearing of
pads on the first three days of prac-
tice.

The NCAA Sports Medicine
Handbook recommends that during
heat acclimatization, it is advisable
to use avminimum of protection gear.
Additional recommendations
include provisions for complete
screening of each athlete for previ-
ous heat illness and gradual acclima-
tization of athletes through graduat-
ed practice sessions for the first
seven to 10 days and on abnormally
hot or humid days.

0 Fluid replacement: athletes should
eat a balanced diet and drink ade-
quate fluids 24 hours prior to an
event

0 To avoid dehydration, athletes
should drink ﬂuids one hour before

exercise to maintain body tempera-
ture and lower heart rate. Seventeen
ounces of ﬂuid approximately two
hours before exercise will help.

- During exercise, athletes should
start drinking early and at regular
intervals to offset sweat losses. For
instance, a person who loses three to
four pounds of body weight during
physical activity needs to drink six
to eight cups of fluid during exercise
to offset ﬂuid loss. The ﬂuids should
be near 59-72 degrees Fahrenheit.

- If the period of exercise is longer
than one hour, the addition of carbo-
hydrates and sodium to the ﬂuid is
also recommended. Sports drinks
consumed during exercise help
delay fatigue.

Kathy Segal is a certified personal
trainer who has designed successful
exercise programs for college and
high school athletes.

“We are going to set grand plans to
make this happen. I want to build a pro-
gram that will go into the next century as
one of the best in
the country,” said
Pederson.

Fans and sup-
port are a concern
of Pederson’s. He
said that people in
Pittsburgh are col-
lege sports fans and
that his goal is to
make them Pitt
fans.

“We are going to work aggressively
to bring fans into Pitt stadiums and to
make this the place that people want to

the three-game sweep last week in
Fulton County Stadium and the finish-
ing touches in game six.

Most people wondered why
Steinbrenner would even tamper with a
team on a roll at mid-season by adding
Darryl Strawberry to the roster. We
understood the GM’s intentions during
the American League Championship
Series against Baltimore.

Even though Dwight Gooden did— _

n’t participate in the postseason (and I
think there’s no way Kenny Rogers
should have made it in over him), he
still gave us a lot to cheer about. It’s a
miracle anytime a “washed-up” player
can return and pitch a no-hitter 10
years after winning the World Series.

Cecil Fielder must have felt like a
prisoner trapped in Tiger Stadium. His
“sentence” ended in mid-July, and his
offensive power was added to the ‘90s
Bronx Bombers. His acquisition was
huge — literally.

There were so many other key
additions, but come playoff time, the
biggest man, or boy, of them all was
12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier. Yankees
fans for years to come will remember
this kid as the true “Angel in the
Outﬁeld.” '

And when Wetteland got Mark

Lemke to pop up to Charlie Hayes
down the third-base line for the ﬁnal
out of 1996, the entire city of New
York breathed a sigh of relief — for
they knew the clutch closer would
finally clean his cap after an entire sea-
son of not washing it. ‘

As passionately as I may speak of
destiny’s darlings, I’m still not overly
joyous that the Yanks are the I996
World Champions. But then again, it
could have been worse.

It could have been the Braves.

Philadelphia Phillies are destined to
win the 1997 World Series.

come to see sporting events,” Pederson
said. “We have to do things to make it an
easy, fun event tocome to. I want this to
be a fan-friendly
athletic depart-
ment.”

A high priority
for Pederson’s new
regime is to bring
to life the proposed
convocation center.
The center would
be the home for
Pitt’s basketball

teams, a practice
facility for all other Pitt sports teams,and
a ﬁtness center for all Pitt students.

“It’s a very high priority to me and

   
   

 
 
 

the University. We’ve got great teams and
we need a great place for them to play.
We also have students that need a new
recreational center,” said Pederson.

The search for a new athletic director
was started in August. Over 90 people
expressed interest in the position. The
group included current athletic directors
and high ranking ofﬁcials of major athlet-
ic conferences.

“In what has been a fast—track career,
Steve Pederson has earned great respect
within the collegiate athletic communi-
ty,” Nordenberg said. “After spending
several hours with him, I came to the con-
clusion that his energy, creativity and val-
ues will be huge assets to our athletic pro-
grams.”

Raising hell tak

Matt Townsend

2.  .. .... ac:

What is it about Halloween that brings
out the mischievous side of America’s
youth? During those couple of days sur-
rounding the holiday, eggs and corn are
thrown, trees and houses are toilet—papered,
and mailboxes are smashed. It’s one time
during the year that anarchy and breaking the
law is not only expected, but also accepted
by the public.

Boys are notoriously the culprits of
these neighborhood-tumed-wasteland set-
tings. Where do these young men get this
desire to raise Halloween Havoc‘?

It stems from athletics and competition.
The majority of America’s youth are raised
on athletics and competition. This develops a
competitive and aggressive mindset in chil-
dren. Most children experience competition
of some sort at an early age. Whether it be
from T-ball or Chutes and Ladders, children
get that competitive fever early in life". This
mentality then overﬂows into everything
they do, including raising hell on Halloween.

‘‘I liked going out on Halloween
because it was a night when you could do
anything you wanted and not really worry
about getting caught,” said junior Mike
Tannila. “I played several years of lacrosse
and football and that gave me a strong
aggressive mentality, which is why I enjoyed
Halloween so much  because it is all about
who can top this, and I would do anything to
beat someone.” .

When you’re out and about in the night,
it’s like the big game. Call it the Super Bowl
of vandalism. It’s you and your team versus
the cops or whoever you are harassing. Your
team has a goal. In some cases it’s to com a
car. It can be as simple as scaring little trick-
or—treaters.

“My little brother and his friends were
the best to scare and steal candy from
because it was so easy,” said Tannila

In playing sports, kids learn how to use
teamwork. It’s not only an integral part of
sports, but it ‘s just as important in pranking
someone.

In senior Eric DeMartano’s case, the
teamwork broke down and he ended up get-

es a cannon and fleet feet

ting nabbed by a cop. While a senior in high
school, he was pelting a house with a variety
of vegetables and fruit. Everyone he was
with neglected to look out for cops, and one
camouﬂaged as a pine tree pounced on him
and busted him.

“I didn’t even see him coming, and then
we had to go back the next day and clean this
house for six hours,” said DeMartano.

The Super Bowl of mischief for junior
Dave Krause was the exploding of a broken-
down car. He was part ofa team of 11 able
bodies ranging in age from 11 to 16. The
goal was to demolish a junker in the back
alley a couple of blocks from his house.

The delinquent crew was divided into
two sides. Half the team looked out for cops
or anybody who could cause trouble. The

‘ other side was dedicated to blowing up a

blue 1975 Chevy Nova. By sticking a piece
ofburning wood up the tail pipe wrapped in
paper towels, the team succeeded in setting
the car on ﬁre, and it blew up a couple of
minutes later. Everyone escaped and no one
was seen, because this outﬁt had an excellent

thing Paula should work out soon.

“She is one of those players that
really likes to work through these
things,” Belmonte said. “Being as tall
as she is, Paula is most concerned with
her timing on her hitting.”

Zemrowski will need to get back
on track as the squad prepares to do
battle with Big East rival Notre Dame
on Saturday at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

“Everybody is looking forward to
[Notre Dame] this weekend,”
Belmonte said: “Talent—wise, I think
we’re better, but they’re a tough team.
Of course, we’re not looking past
Robert Morris this week.”

Belmonte feels the practices and
tough tournaments the Panthers have
gone through thus far in the 1996
campaign could play to their advan-
tage for the upcoming weekend.

“It’s really been an ongoing
process,” Belmonte said. “The kids
needed experience this season and
they got a lot of it earlier in the year.
There are a number of different line-
ups we can go with, so we’re not too
worried.”

Like most matches for the
Panthers this season, it just may come
down to which player’s turn it is to
step it up.

Panther volleyball notes:

- Hitter Julie Cress did not make the
trip last weekend due to lower back
problems and is listed as day—to-day.
She is currently questionable for the
upcoming weekend against Notre
Dame and West Virginia.

‘”That’s the way we did everything, in a
big group, because it was so easy to do
things that way,” said Krause.

Playing sports also develops muscles
that are essential in being good at vandalism.
A strong arm and fast feet are key attributes
for anyone who wants to be a good player
on Halloween night. The ideal hoodlum
would be a mixture of John Smolt2’s arm
and Michael Johnson’s feet. He could hit a
car window from ﬁve blocks away and be
fast enough to outrun anything.

Junior Matt Smith hung around such
athletic vandals.

“I had a buddy with a strong arm, and
he could hit a house from four big yards
away,” Smith said. “It was perfect because
we didn’t even have to run, because the peo-
ple would have no idea where it was coming
from.”

The roots of such vandalism come from
this country’s obsession with sports and
competition. Children are raised to compete
and havoc is one huge game to them. So as
long as there are sports in America, there
will be Halloween Havoc.
