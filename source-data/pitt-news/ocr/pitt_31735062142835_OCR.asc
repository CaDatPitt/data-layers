Oslo School
Opens Doors

Oppor,tun.ities for foreign study
———a traditional part of a‘ liberal
education —- are opening in the
post-war world.

Shut ‘off completely by the war,
travel abroad, once the sole privi-
lege of the well—to—do, soon will
be‘ within the reach of every col-
lege student.

tional beneﬁts to study at approv-
ed European schools.

uates are planned by the Univer-
sity of Oslo, Norway. The univer-
sity’s special summer school ses-
sion, from July 7 to August 16,
1947. is open to American stu-
dents who have completed at least
their freshman year.

Oslo First
In announcing the Norwegian

ell, director of Pitt’s nationality
rooms,.stated, “The University of
Oslo probably is the first of the
many European schools to be
opened to Americans. Opportuni-
ties will increase rapidly as con-
ditions abroad improve. Possibly
by next summer, students may be
able to attend schools in France
and-— Italy also.”

All -students will be required to
take a survey course in Nor-
wegian culture. Those in the sci-
ence ﬁeld may study geology,
geography, botany, meteorology,
and marine andfresh water bi-
ology. In the humanities, the uni-
versity offers courses in Norwe-
gian language and literature, his-
tory, institutions, social problems,

lar professors and lecturers, un-
der the direction of an American
dean and registrar. '

ence majors andguided weekend
excursions for all students.

The summer would cost ap-
proximately $700, This includes
transportation, tourist class. Tui-
tion and board are $75 each for
the six-weeks period. Fees, ex-
cursions. and incidentals account
for the rest. Oslo courses are ap-
proved by the Veterans’ adminis-
tration for GI students. 0

 7 2-59 Win Over
‘ Pitt in Finale

»HAA&lNC.

West Virginia’s tourney-found
Mountaineers won their seven-
tenth game of the season by de-
feating Pitt, 72-59. It was the
Mountaineers twenty-ninth
straight. victory on the ,home
court.‘The game was the final one
of the season for Pitt. 1 .

Trailing 86-30 at the half, the
Panthers were unable to match
the Mountaineer ‘scoring spurt
during the third quarter. They
were behind 11 points at the start
of the ﬁnal canto and never seri-
ously threatened the West Vir-
ginia margin. ~ '

The high—scoring Mountaineers
were pressed throughhout the first
half. But they stepped off to a
22-16 ﬁrst period lead. And al-
though the harassing Panthers
matched them /point for point dur-
ing the second stanza, they were

_ unable to narrow the gap.

Pitt challenged the Mountain-
. eers twice. Once in the ﬁrst period
they pulled up to, 8-7. Early in
the second quarter the hustling
-Carlsonmen whittled the deﬁcit
to trail, 24-21. ’
Dodo. Canterna tallied seven
ﬁeld goals and thirteen free
throws to "top all scores with 27
points. As usual Fred Schaus pac-
ed the Mountaineers. He register-
ed 25 markers. Pitt was never
sharper at the foul line. They
clicked on 25 out of 31 penalty
tosses, -

-Cage Slants . . .

‘ Canterna’s 27 points established
as new high for the season. Pre-
vious high mark was held by

‘ Captain Nate Apple who popped

in 19 tallies during the Tech-Pitt
clash, January 8.
Doc Carlson has now completed

_25 seasons as Panther mentor.

During this period he has won 28
and .lost 21 to the Mountaineers.

M.......a Drills
Resume Today

Reports that ‘baseball coach
Ralph Mitterling and some
members of rhis pitching staff

were drowned in Pitt, stadium
have been branded as deﬁnite-
ly false. The denial comes from
the alive and still drenched dia-
mond coach himself.

It seems that last week when
candidates for pitching and
catching positions reported for
duty at the Pa_nther’s indoor
practice ﬁeld under the stadium
seats, they found their diamond
ﬂooded. A broken water main
in the stadium was the cause.»

Coach Mitterling reports that
everything is well under control
and “practice sessions will re-
sume this afternoon at 3:30 for
catchers and pitchers.

Y Five Wins

.Two Thrillers

“Class will tell,’’ goes the old
saying, and the Pitt YMCA bas-
ketball ball team is proving that
it has plenty of class. Two close
victories over East Liberty and
North Boroughs has placed the
Pitt team in ﬁrst place in the Met-
ropolitan Y league. Their, record
is -four won and one lost, with
two games remaining. '

The past Wednesday, the Pitt Y
put on its greatest exhibition of
basketball trouncing a strong East
Liberty quintet, 57-55. Tony Raz-
zano again proved to be the star.
He scored 22 points to raise his
total to 77 infour games and he
also passed brilliantly.

.On Thursday the same team was
almost upset by a game North
Boroughs team, but had enough
to win out, 44-41. Rozzano’s foul
shooting was a big factor in the
victory. He made 9 ffouls in 11'
tries.

Close Battles
Mark Frat .
Court Chase

‘ Things were popping last Thurs-
day in the Interfraternity basket-
ball circuit. Two title contenders,
PiKA and Delta Tau Delta, almost
lost all hopes of grabbing cham-
pionship berths in tilts with a pair
of IF cellar dwellers.

The second place PiKA’s bumped
into trouble when they engaged
the lowly Pi Lams and were bare-
ly able to eke out a 33-31 decision.

,The Pi Lams have been tossing

plenty of trouble around in their
last few games, even though they
were eliminated from the title
chase early in the season.

Delta Tau Delta stared defeat
in the face from the opening min-
utes to the ﬁnal gun, as the scor-
ingin their battle with last place
Alpha Phi Alphasee-sawed back
and forth. The Delts were just
able to sneak through a 35-34

win. A loss would have all but_

exterminated the title aspirations
of the third-place ﬁve.
