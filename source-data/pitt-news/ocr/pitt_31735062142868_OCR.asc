AFrAesIzman‘/ Claims
Sentence Unjust

’ 3Branding his punishment as a

frame-up, John H. Bowman, Engi- --

neering freshman and" nephew of
Chancellor John G’. Bowman, threw
into an uproar the sec nd session of
the Senior Court, in "com 315 Al-
umni Hall last Thursday afternoon.
Approximately one hundred upper
classmen attending the meeting.
Called to. the ‘stand by_ Milton
Safier,‘ chairman of the Senior
Court,‘ and asked why he‘ had not
‘A.w‘orn the "bird cage, the sentence
for which was given him the ﬁrst
._*_s.ession of. the Court as a penalty
for_neg1ecting' to wear his dink,
ABowman made .. his startling ac-
~'cusation and -refused to answer the
question- The Court then sentenced
him to wear a burlap sack and to
attach a sign to the front of it
worded,’ “Mourning. a -Lost Oppor-
tunity.” When the paper went to
press, Bowman had not yet com-
. plied with the sentence and accord-

.in‘g' to Safier is to appear again at I

the next sessionof the Court.
' Accompanying the sentence of
Bowmanwere those of several other
Freshmen. Saul L. 'Williams was
'_orderAed: to wear a loud colored
turban about the campus and to last
Saturday’s game. ‘ For forgetting
_h‘is_  dink, Harry J . Miller
wassentenced to wear a dunce- cap.
In ' spite of his excuse that he
couldn’t get his locker open to ob-
tain his dink, Leroy Crawfo_rd was
given the choice of wearing either
‘a.i‘ba.thr_obe or a nightshirt on the
campus besides carrying a sign stat-
mg, “I Couldn’t- Take’ My, Bathrobe
Olf This Morning.”

,. Ai_Taking cognizance of the old say-
-ing concerning a bird ii the hand,
Safier ordered the last four Fresh-
men appearing before the Court to

TRIALS or PANTHER
EoiToRA EXPLAINED

[Editoi-’s Note——This is the ﬁrst of a.
series of interviews with leaders in ,
campus activities. The purpose is not
only to give new students rat-the. Uni-
versity an idea of the activities con-
cerned, but also to present an inti-
mate picture of campus life.]

“The real fun comes after you get
to be editor,”’remarked.the Panther
mogul,‘Bernard G." Davis, Bus. Ad.
’27,Aas" -he swore softly under his

breath and —wiped"two drops of per-

spiration from his brow. Then,
throwing half of theother contrib-
'utor’s. poor‘ jokes ‘into’ the waste
basket, he wracked his brain to think
up more to take their place.“ For this
it was that he had spent three years
of drudgery in the famous‘ Frick-
Barn! ' . ‘ = » -

But not all the Panther life is hard
work and worry. Once each month
there comesa Monday morning_when
the'- campus” rings with “Panther!
Haveyou got your? Panther?” and-
co-eds sit about Alumni Hall giggling
over some crack that the editor had
intended, but forgotten, to throw out.
Sour.-faced critics‘ from the Weekly
try to go clear through the issue

without_ a laugh; and the Panther

is the talk of all Pitt. On that Mon-
day the ’Paiitlie~r staff throws off its
air of worry and turns with‘ modest

. pride to the results of its efforts.

The editor chuckles twice. And once

the other .2 contributor bursts out‘

laughing.

Dear Alumnus: <7‘
The folder that comes to you
with this letter tells the story
of the new Unlverslty of Pitts-

The Record a success.
“In the frequent appeals that
come to you in one month. few
of them promise you anything.‘
You are asked tovgive to help
other people. W'hat happens to
you or your purse does not count.
In subscribing to The Unlvor- '
slty of Pitt.~‘xInu-gl_n. Record, you
are going‘ to help yourself. There
has not been, upto this time, a
regular way for you to know
what the University is trying to
do, what its achievements are, t
and What still lies ahead. There. »
has not been ‘a permanent mag-
azine story which lets you watch
the University grow. You have
had nojournal to tellpyou of your
school’s history or future. -. ’

portance has its quzu-tperrly. or‘
monthly magazine. No man‘ has-
.more- interest in University prog-
ress than an alumnus, andhoman
needs to know more about this
progress than an alumnus. When
the question comes up,- ?_‘W’hat is
the University doing in ‘Its eve- p
ning school?" you ‘ought to be
able to answer. And if some one
-asks, “\Vhat kind of‘radi.o*.cour.ses:
does your school give?"- ‘you
should know. How are you,-as
an alumnus, going to keep in
touch with campus affairs?

The University of. Pittsburgh
Record will tell the whole story.
of University work.‘ Every tnree
months it will give a live. read-
able picture of the things that
have happened. "Phe Record‘ is..
the one sure source» of‘ Univer-- f
sity information. [To read The
Ilecord ‘Will be to returnhto col- '
_legfe. _ . ' :
The Iieoord stands-..ready to‘

fore the subscription blank leaves
your hands. For sue-h_a price——
only fifty cents every three
months, as its nzure-x out—-you can
give to the University a magazine
that will serve you as it serves’
the school. You are not asked for
a two dollar gift, but for a_ sub-
scription for which you get full
returns for a whole year. ‘
“fill you not, as an alumnus.

HOME
DESCRIBED BY
DR.S-VARGA

‘Can you imagine a Pitt student
getting into any class he wants? It

just isn’t being done here, but in

Hungarian universities there is no
such thing as a refusal to admit
more than a set number of students
to a class. p
Such is the freedom of the Hun-
garian student, accordingto obser-
vations by Dr. S. Varga, of the Uni-
versity of Budapest, who is doing re-
search work in economics at Pitt.
Dr. Varga is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Budapest where be ob-

tained his degree of. Doctor of Poli- -

tics.’ He has also studied at the

‘ University of Berlin and London

School of Economics and has adi-

ploma from the Polytechnic Insti- ~

tute of Budapest, admission to which
is restricted to students having.
their doctor's degree._ He has also
led seminars for six years _at the
University of Budapest and has
come to,America for further obser-
vation 'in his ﬁeld and to continue
research work he has done through-
out Europe. He is a writer as well

as a lecturer on economic problems _

and has written for many? German
and Hungarian periodicals.
But the freedom the Hungarian

student enjoysdoes not end witlrhis , '

selection of coures. He may also
select any professor heywishes, some-
thing ofwhich the Pitt Fresh is en-,
tirely ignorant. And then, of course,

“there is that good old" -European -

idea of free attendance at classes,
whose existence at Pitt is known
only to a. select group of twelve
“Honor Course” students. _ But
there is a ﬁnal examination day even
in Hungary. ~ l  ' I '

,It.is just at this point. that}. the
Hungarian system differs radically
from that in use during, undergrad-
uate examinations at Pitt. The Hun-
garian student does not know which
instructor will _
and may ﬁnd himself questioned by
a professor who lectured on theories
altogether different from, and con-
tradictory to those. of his own in-
structoia. However, the student has
much’ leeway in the examination*it-
self.’ He is expected only‘ to ex-
press his ownopinions and is.grad-
ed on the soundness of his theories,
whether ’or not it agrees with those
of his instructor. '

But~ freedom -in learning ‘is car- "

ried still further, even to the in-
structors.
life, with the result that they are
somewhat more independent than
those in -America. , They are re-
tired at the age of 70 with full sal-

ary,»continuing til ldeath._E‘ach in- l

structor lectures ‘on his‘ subject ex-

actly as he sees fit.‘ Whereas in-

structorsjin the same, department
in the ‘American’ ‘university; co.-oper-
ate; with each other,_in Europe an
instructor seldom mentions; ideas
other than his own. I It often‘; hap-

-:pens«= that of several instructors ‘in

the same de artment,.each one"may

lecture on t eories totally: conﬂict- , S

ing with those‘ of his associates. _

The work taken up in the first
two yearsiii the. universities in the
United States is practically the same
as that taken inpthe “ﬁnal~years_ in
the middle schools of}-Iungary, ac-

cording to Dr. Varga. I-Iungary has T ' [A

four kinds of middle schoolsrthe
Technical School,
Economics
School for Veterinary Physicians,‘
and the School of Arts and Sculp-

ture. The work takenup in the uni-

versities, such as that in Budapest,

is somewhat similar to that given in

V the ﬁnal-years of American univer-

sities and in the graduate ‘schools.

, Commenting on ﬁnancial condi-3
_ tions in the Europe of today, Dr. '

Varga points .out thatit is.espe-

cially signiﬁcant that the victorious '
_nations of the recent war’suffere’tl:_as _
much as -the conquered ‘in .the..depre-V"

ciation of currency. -Since the ‘de-
preciation, however, the countries
have been-improved under the super-
vision of the League of Nations, but
the ﬁnancial condition _ of the sub-

disrupted. As an example, Dr. Var--. , V O 2

ga cites the case of what was for-
merly Austria-Hungary. A manu-
facturing concern in Budapest, for
example, may have supplied all parts
of Austria-Hungary with a certain
commodity. After‘ the war this was
divided into many parts and. its
market limited to what is now, Hun-

gary, because of the high custom.

duties that prevail, preventing ac-
cess to its ‘former market., Thus,

the complete facilities of the con-

cern cannet be "utilized except by-
changing over part of it to manu-
facture ' another, commodity, . which
entails great effort as ‘well as ex-
pense. Regions which were former-
ly supplied by this concern had to
git fac_ilit.1e__s_ to supply themselves.-

worries weighed upon the business
manager’s‘ mind. His first assistant
was .too busy. The reporter was
about to despair. ‘

But-. just then the circulation man-
ager came in from a hard day’s work.

.Fpr'eig-ht hours he had been directing -
the mad‘ salesmen with their “Pan—--

ther, Panther!‘ Get your Panther

here! Forty pages of wit,and wise :

cracks! 'A la-ughin every joke! A
joke to every inch! Only twenty-ﬁve
cents! Getyour Panther here!” He

sank-down‘ in. exhaustion‘ and began .

‘to: stack up dollarbills in ‘little. bales.

Between bales, he addressed out-of— .

town copies and gave instructions to
his numerous‘ staff. Every two min-
utes, somebody had to see him. But
bouncing up and down the room, he
managed to give the Weekly reporter
an .Occasiona1'wor.d. He had used

“sixteengsalesmen during, the day in

"addition to his staff of mailers. It
had been awild and proﬁtable day.

Of course, we might go on with

the‘ collections, and the dozen other
phases ‘of the Panther organization.
But we. haven’t the space. If you’re

and apply for a» job. There’s plenty

spoiid;.by turning out to the extent
of igiearly 20,000 sp'ectatoi's." _
Tli'e~ first three .quarters, especial-
ly the latter part of the second,
was pleasing to Pitt followers. In
that " period, the Panthers tiedthe
scoremat’ 7-all after the Leopards
had scored on a forward pass and
had" added the subsequent. extra

 

pointliby placement. . After that the »

For Pitt, Welch again starred in

the aerial attack. THE! extended
himself to his u.tr.no.st.in Ifeaclzlne
the forward which resulted in P1l:t’s

Camels made cigarettes

the popular smoker

,TI-IROUGH. sheer quality, through
"a never before known smoking en-
joyment, Camels won the world to
cigarettes. Camel was the ﬁrst and
only cigarette that combined all the
gooclnesses of the choicest Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos, and Camel

‘ became the greatest smoke word of

all ages._ No tobacco name com-
pares with Camel.‘ ‘

Camel won and holds its over-
whelming preference through in-
domitable tobacco quality.'Only the
choicest Turkish and Domestic

tobaccos are rolled into Camels.
These ﬁne tobaccos receive the
skilful blending that only the
world’s largest tobacco organiza-
tion could give. Nothing is too
good or too expensive that will
tnake.Camels, regardless of price,
theutmost in cigarettes.

If you have never yet tried
Camels, a new sensation in smok-
ing pleasure awaits you. The sen-
sation of the choicest, the most
perfectly blended tobaccos that
money can buy.‘ H are a Camel!
