Pan - American Conference
Willi Form New Policy;

‘By John Martinco V

Delegates to the Pan-American
Conference, meeting at Buenos Aires
next month, may witness the proposal
of a new inter-American agreement
that will go down in history as did the
Monroe Doctrine. This is the opin-
ion of Dr. Hubert Herring, seminar
leader on Latin-American affairs, who
spoke before Inquiry Forum Monday
noon.

“It is probable,” Dr. Herring de-
clared, “that President Roosevelt and
Secretary of State Cordell Hull will
propose a new doctrine, ‘multilateral
in character, that will replace the
unilateral Monroe Doctrine.”

He discussed several of the condi-
tions that would make the 20 other
American nations receptive to such
a proposal by the United States. At
present, according to the speaker,
there is much less “hullabaloo” about
the Monroe Doctrine, partly due to
the f-act that the United States has
\not mentioned it above a whisper in

Dobson, Looking For Talent,
Shows Interest In Cast
At Show Rehearsal

By Stan Markey

College dramatics and radio are the
proving grounds of the future movie
star, insists Ned Dobson,. scout for
the Republic Picture Company, who
visited the Pitt Players’ rehearsal of
their latest production, “The First
Mrs. Fraser,” on Monday.

Mr. Dobson, who is looking for un-
usual talent among the Players,
pointed out that Robert Taylor, Fred
McMurray, Bing Crosby, and Robert
Montgomery are products of the col-
lege dramatic groups and asse1'ted,
“There” is no reason why the men
and women now performing before the
college footlights should not be the
stars of the future. -

“The legitimate stage and vaude-
ville are no longer fertile sources for
motion pictures. The stars are now
going from the movies to the "stage,
instead of the former progression of
t-he stage to the movies.”

. _ Outside the college groups, promi-

nent "stars have appeared as grad-;
uates of the American Association
of ,Dram_atic Arts in New York. This
school -has produced such stars as
Spencer Tracy, Allan Jenkins, and
Randolph Scott. .»

Single performance tickets can be

First Music Hour

 

(Continued from Page 1)
Jubilee, staged by the Sun-Telegraph

“Negro folk music is characterized
by its simple melodic lines and rudi-
mentary chording,” comments Mrs.
Dawson. “Nevertheless, the appar-
ent simplicity of treatment has ap-
pealed to many of the great compos-
ers. Stephen Foster derived many of
his best known songs, wholly or in
part from many of our spirituals, and
the great Bohemian composer, Anton
Dvorak, based the largo movement in
his New World Symphony from
“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.”

Today’s program will be divided
into sections illustrating the “shout-
in’,” “sorrow,” and “glory” songs of
the Negro race. Mrs. Dawson will il-
lustrate each particular type with her
oral program notes. As an added fea-
ture, Miss Fanetta Nelson, pupil of
the Cardwell School, will present sev-
eral short piano studies.

In addition to several songs by com-
posers of grand opera and the piano
numbers of Miss Nelson, the program
will consist of the following spirit-
uals:

New  ‘In Fine Arts
Librliry Gives Secrets

   

Combining the technique of IIII
movie fan magazines with the thei-
oughness of a history, “Movie Pa-
rade,” by Paul Roth, is one of the
new volumes added to the library of
thetdepartment of fine arts.

The book gives the background of
the development of the different kinds
and tricks of the moving pictures.

For all who are ‘interested in a
greater knowledge of mankind and
art, the library has “Art and Life in
New Guinea," by Raymond Firth. It
explains the forms of culture in that
country and contains 80 reproductions
of architecture, sculpture, weapons,
and objects of ritual of the inhabit-
ants.

“Oi_l and Grease Paint,” the auto-
biography of Dame Laura Knight,
relates her association with the stu-
dio, circus, and stage which she por-
trayed on her canvases. The book is
illustrated throughout with sketches
of her paintings.

Those who journeyed to Cleveland
last year to attend the Van Gogh ex-
hibition will enjoy “Letters to An
Artist—from Vincent Van Gogh to
Anton Ridder von Rappard.”

Women Debaters
Will Use Oregon
Style At Schenley

 

Five members of the Women's De-

bating Association will take time out
at 1 o'clock Thursday afternoon to
appear in a debate before students of
Schenley high school.
, Miss Theresa Kahn, instructor in
English and coach of the debaters,
has announced that the Oregon debate
will be the type used. This system
of debating stresses a cross-examina-
tion of speakers instead of the ordi-
nary refutation.

Supporting the affirmative side will
be Rita Koruzo, C38. Opposing her
will be Lorraine Simpson, C39. Sched-
uled to handle the cross-examinations
are Florence Hiller, BA37, for the
aﬂirmative, and Ruth Shapiro, C37,
for the negative. Marcella Leyton,
C37, will act as chairman.

“Resolved, That Congress Should
Have the Power to Regulate Minimum
Wages and Maximum Hours in In-
dustry,” the question adopted by the
Association for its extension debates,
will be used.

Installation work was begun yes-
terday on the chancel group of
stained glass windows of the Heinz
Memorial Chapel, shortly after the
arrival of the first shipment of glass.

The five windows of the chancel
group, now being completed by Charles
J. Connick in his Boston studio, are
expected to be entirely installed by
January 1, according to John Weber,
University business manager. Each
window will be about 30 feet in
height. '

Yesterday's shipment consisted of
the “tracery” at the top of the win-
dows. The glass is being installed
by Conni.ck employes.

Christian Virtue Stressed

The Boston Transcript, comment-
ing on the windows, November 10,
said: “This arrangement of five win-

dows has been designed as a sym-

phony in form and color to sing forth
eloquently of abiding Christian vir-
tues, beginning in the center with
the greatest of these, Charity, or Love,

and continuing at left and right with 1

symbols of Faith, Hope, Justice and
Wisdom.”

Each window is dominated by a
symbolization _of Christ to emphasize
the virtue the window represents.

Below the symbol of Christ is a New
Testament character, a disciple or
apostle of Christ. Beneath this is an
Old Testament ﬁgure. Included in
the group are Moses, Samuel, King
David, Abraham, and Solomon.

The angelic ﬁgures throughout the
five windows have wings of signiﬁ-
cant color: Charity, red; Faith. white;
Hope, green; Wisdom, blue; Justice,
purple. The signiﬁcant colors also
occur throughout the growing form
that deﬁnes the ornamental structure
of the design.

nent consulting engineer, will be the
featured speaker at the meeting of
the combined aeronautical and me-
chanical engineering seminar tomor-

Good digestion and healthy nerves are important

they won’t exactly be “puiferbellies,”
at least, not for the ﬁrst 150 feet,
but they will attract plenty of atten-
tion to the annual cross country in-

According to present plans, the

at about 4:30 o’clock. The ﬁrst run-
ner to sight this same starter again
should, if the amount of practice the
early entrants are putting in over

chalk up a new record for these
itcross-campus affairs.
A Chance to Score Points

Mr. Feely ,stressed that the “run’
is open to all boys who are eligible
for intramural participation and any
points scored’ will count toward in-
tramural letters. Seven-man teams
may be entered by any recognized
campus organization as well as fra-
ternities. ,A_- team . iJ1'0PhY Will be
awarded to the team scoring the low-

by adding the number‘-of the places
in which team members ﬁnish. There
is still time for. organizations or in-
dividuals to enter, bubvery little time
for entries close at 5 o’clock this
afternoon. -

Unless there is a last-minute change
in the route the runners will start at
Gate 3 of the Stadium, circle around
the edge of Trees Gym ﬁeld and the
football practice ﬁeld, continue along
Breckenridge Street to the Falk
School, from there down University
Drive past the Dental School, down
the walk to the athletic office, back to
Gate 3, and then one lap around the
Stadium track to ﬁnish up. The ﬂag
marked course is about a mile’ and a
half long.

ball team crush _a favored Cornhusker

Johnﬂya a junior and a sub left’

for one of the ﬁve Pitt touchdowns.

competition for already. entered are
the Phi .Gams, Pi KAS, Phi‘ Eps, Phi
Kaps, Pi‘ Lains, Sigma Chis and-the
Theta Chis.

Although team entries do not come
up to last year’s total of 13, individual
entries are expected to exceed last
year’s list of -45 runners inasmuch .as‘
lo'ne wolf points are necessary to-
wardintramural letters. 1

Where the ﬁrst Panther Run began
at the corner of Fifth Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard and ended on the
Alumni Hall ramp, the ruin tomorrow
is centered about the stadium. The
distance has been increased from one
mile to approximately one and a
half miles.

Last year Jimmy Filson, ace of the
frosh track squad, paced the ﬁeld in
a fast 3 minutes 51 seconds, but as
the course is longer this year no

It has happened again. Those Kap-
pa Sigs and Phi Eps have had their
second round -playoff postponed for
the nthitime. Meanwhile Phi Gamma
Delta, who impressively battled its

. way into the ﬁnals, is at the top wait-

ing. .

nity Touch Football Tourney entering
its twilight, a reviewof events‘ along
the ﬁring line of the past three weeks
seems to ‘be in order at this point. The
tournament was oﬂicially opened

. Tuesday, October 2.7, with the Theta
' "Chis carving out a 5-0 ﬁrst down de-

cision over the SAES.

In the upper bracket, Theta Chi
continued merrily on its way, taking
the Delts in stride, but efound'Phi
Gamma Delta too hard a nut to crack.
Asa matter of fact the Fijis have
proven themselves too much of an ob-
stacle for the entire bracket by suc-
cessivelytrimming _Pi Kappa Alpha,
SAM, and Theta Chi, 13-0, 13-0, and
7-6, respectively.

. Some Slower Action

Action has been much slower in the
lower bracket. Sigma Chi pulled a
close one out of the ﬁre when they
downed Phi Kappa, but faltered

1 against the Phi Delts who are still

waiting for the results of the Kappa
Sig, Phi Eps tilt. Losers in ﬁrst
round competition in this bracket
were Phi Lambda Phi, and Lambda
Phi Ep drew the only bye.

A ﬁnal date has not as yet been
set for the tourney and until the low-'
er bracket eliminates two of the three
contenders for the honors nothing
will be done about a tentative date.

Along a different battlefront a’
more deﬁnite .standing has been
reached. In the Independent league,
the Newman club has gained undis-
puted possession of ﬁrstvplace by vir-
tue of a sound thrashing administered
to the Alpha Phis on Monday.

Ratings Crazy, Reporter Loony,

But We Believe It--P

 

Amid A Thesis On Advanced
Einsteinian Hypotheses
Is Pitt Grid Glory

 

By HERKY
Football ratings are crazy things.
Take three well-seasoned schedules,
add a couple last-minute touchdowns,
a lucky ﬁeld goal, a shot of Seagram’s
7, and a cross-eyed sports editor, and

you have an excellent recipe for pick-
ing the year’s most outstanding teams
in order. A

Azzi Ratem,
compiled by Wil- .
liam F. Boand, is ‘ § 49,
one of these rat-.. '
ing systems. It
takes in _every'_
team in the«coun‘-
try, big or little,
and aftera series
of abtruse’I'nathe-

 

matical : _- .calcula- -, »

tions in which the calculus of varia-
tions, as ﬁrst. expounded by. Isaac
Newton and the Bernoulli brothers in
1697, as- well “as “certain variations
ﬁrst discovered by Gauss ‘in 1.847
while engaged in investigating the
atomic variations of -chemical ele-
ments of high atomic weight and -num-
ber, an investigation which has _since
ied to Einstein’s theory of the fourth
dimension as ﬁrst set forth by "Rie-
mann and Christoffel in their well-
known text disputing Euclid’s theory

regarding, the proof ofﬁparallelism in -

lines one plarie, old A{'5.Zi ﬁg11r§s.0ut
just how good _a team is, even If Po-

dunk, or Dug,ues»ne did beat it. ‘(How

else can I get an A in differential
equations?) ’
But on second thought there might

be something to old Azzi’s system '

after all. Upon a second and third

more searching examination, it ap-

pears that Pitt (yes, our own Golden
Panthers) has for the last seven

(

years had the best football team in
the entire country. ‘ _

Minnesota has been good for quite
a while. Before that it was. South-
ern California. Before that, Michi-
gan and Notre Dame showed their
heels to the pack. But through the
years, in fact, ever since 1929',‘ Pitt
has never failed to rate right up
among the leaders, and shows the
most consistently ‘top-notch _record of
any football team in America. Con-
nellsville High hasn’t done so bad
either, outside of the Uniontown
game in ’33.

The only team in the country which
has rated within Azzi’s ﬁrst twenty

teams all seven years, Pitt has piled-
, up'the aggregate of only,51 points,

giving one point for ﬁrst, two for sec-
ond, and so on. If a team failed to
rate in the ﬁrst twenty, it was_ given

‘ twenty points and the beneﬁt of the

doubt. .

Where Art Thou, Minnesota?
VSecond_-zon the "list was :So_uthern.
California with 53 points. "Although
the "Trojans had. two’ ﬁrsts and two
seconds on its‘ list, Pitt nosed it out
on the" strength of the- Western
team’s weakness -in 1934 and 1935.
' Notre Dame is- third with 66' points
followed by Stanford. and Michigan
with 79 apiece. (Say, where the hell
is this Minnesota team?) '

‘ In sixth place comes Tennessee with  :_

86 points,‘ then. Ohio State with -87,
and Alabama with 88.

Colgate rates ninthwith 89 points

derful teams, and with 92 points in-
Cluding tWo firsts in 1934-35--there is
Minnesota . . . Long yell for the
Gophers! _

Anyway. that’s ‘what -Azzi says.
And here’s the reason: From 1929,
when the Gophers came 19th, till
1933, whenfthey '_ garnered -only 11
points, and jumped‘ up" to ﬁrst the

itt’s

(Still no i

h

But Where Is Minnesota?
Way Down In Tenth-

 

year afterward, they just didn't rate.
This lapse into mediocrity gave Michi-
gan _a chance, and Michigan came
through. . '

1 Colleges from all sections of the
country are represented in the first
25 teams. Of these, ﬁve are fromthc
East, six from the South, seven from
the Mid-West, three from the South-
west, and four from the Paciﬁc
Coast. "

' Pitt to Stay-First -

Pitt rates "far ahead "in the East,
38 points ahead of 3Colga_te'. Tennes-
see is the best team in"_t_he South.
Notre Dame shows the‘ way for Mid-
western teams, whilé'Texas Christian
and Southern Californ-ia-"are ‘far in
the lead in their respective’ ‘sections

'  Incidentally, when Azzi’s ratings

come out for 1936, Pitt will in all

probability still be ahead. Southern

Farmer’: Son Was Student

One of the questioners found a for-
mer student of the University rural
sociology class in the home of his
host; and another member was in-
formed that the"farmer’s son was for-
merly an instructor in political science
here.

As is typical in a farming com-
munity, most of the farmers rented
their land, in many cases from a
fatlier-in-law or. uncle. Of the rented
farms, much of the land is worked
on the half-and-half basis, the tenant
farmer paying half of his earnings
to the owner in lieu of rent.

Arncricas Discussed At Inquiry

recent years.’ He also stated that the
Latin-Americans like and trust Frank-
lin D- Roosevelt, and admire Cordell
Hull for his ‘simplicity and honesty.

Dr. Herring pronounced President
Roosevelt’sr;~'-attendance “very signiﬁ-
cant.” explained that the pres-
ence of chief executive will lend
moral prestige to the conference and
will mean a great deal to the people
of South and Central America.

‘.‘This may be the most important

conference -of American states ever
held,” he said. (“It may write a new
and_ important chapter in the history
of the" United States!’ _

He announced that the conference
has a two-fold program to accomplish.

1 The-ﬁrst is the provision’ of some ma-

chinery for insuring peace‘ in the
Western Hemisphere ;“ and second, the
collective American insulation against
wars of Europe and Asia.
“The'U_nited States’ view of this
meeting,” asserted Dr.-Herring, “is
that it’ is a proving ground to test
new models of compacts for interna-
tional accord. The time has come to

consolidate the substantial gains made.

under the New Dea1’s “Good Neigh-
bor” policy to form a covenant of the
Latin-American nations and’ also to
take a stand against foreign Wars.”

As the three chief objectives of the
conference, he‘ listed peace, neutrality,
and trade. ' ’ .

‘The United States is deﬁnitely-not
going into the League of Nations,”
hesaid. "“The more likely alternative

is "the forging together of the vari-

ous peace pacts existing in the Amer-
icas and— their consolidation into one
new accord.

“It will be Well topiremember, he '

cautioned, “ that even rather ‘weak-
kneed’ pacts have not won unanimity
of assent. Therefore, it is extremely
unlikely that. a pact with teeth in it
will go through with anything like
unanimous assent.”

‘{" ‘he Pan-American countries,” he
afraid of hungry
European dictatorship and may turn
to the Monroe Doctrine whether they

e it orqnot. The time is ripe for
tnese countries to get together and
say in concert what the United States
has been saying in solo.”

Dr. Herring praised the efforts of
Cordell Hull in his work as Secretary
of"-State, and criticized just as vigor-

F‘
_,..

 

ously some of the men in diplomatic
posts. '

“The time" will come,”. he said,
“when we will say that the President
has no right to“ endanger the United
States by putting into o_ﬂ"ice men
whose only qualiﬁcations are the
amount of money contributed to the
campaign chest of the party.”

The seminar leader summed up the
conference situation by presenting a
list of obstacles and allies in the
drive for a Pan-American pact. As
obstacles, he listedothe still remain-
ing fear of the United States by most
of _the other‘ American countries,
their previous_ commitments with
each other, the _obstinate jealousies
and hatreds existing. among" them, the
profusion of dictatorships in Latin-
America, and the widespread fear of
entang-ling alliances.

As allies, he named the new meas-
ure of.conﬁdence in the motives of
the United States, the failure of the
Chaco negotiations, the sobering
threat of war in Europe and Asia,
and the. improved business conditions.
