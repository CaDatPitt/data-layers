Meeting Turns Into
Round-Table Talk;
13 Senators Present V
Lack of quorum at last

week’s Senate meeting turn-
. ed the legislative session into

é

a round-table discussion.
The Constitution requires
that half of the thirty mem-

bers be present in order- to form
a quorum. Only thirteen senators
were present at the meeting,

A special pin for senators to
wear was among the items sug-
gested. This pin would make it
easy for students to recognize sen-
ators on campus and thus enable

.» ‘them to approach their SG repre-
- fsentatives directly with problems

and ideas.
Alan Garﬁnkle felt the pin
was necessary because a lack of

student support in the form of _

pressure and interest groups has
been a chief reason behind the

Senate’s inability to meet stu-

dent needs.

The discussion included a de-
bate over what should constitute
a quorum. Larry Land felt the
number necessary be changed
.from ﬁfteen to ten. Tom Lohrentz
pointed out a facet of parliament-
ary precedure which states that

4a quorum is present unless chal-
lenged.

However, Lohrentz’s observa-
tion was discarded because of
precedent. There was also a con-
troversy over the representation
system which exists under the
present Constitution.

But as Senator Land said, “We
can’t vote; this is just idle dis-
cussion, because we can’t do any-

, thing.”

‘Bushing Program
For Sororities

A new system of rush has been
initaited by the Pan Hellenic
'Assoc. The old method of lunch-
eon dating is no longer in effect.

Under the new rules arrange-
ments for lunch or coke may be
made only onithe day on which
the date is to take place. Sorority
members may not extend personal
invitations to women students for
University events more than two
weeks in advance.

Invitations to University events

‘may be extended in person or by
telephone; all others must be made
,_,i_n person for not more than one

;,,event at a time.

Chance To Know

.. This plan is intended to give the
new student the best opportunity
to know a number of sororities
before she is asked to make a
choice. ~

Sorority members are urged
not to make arrangements for
any dates during vacation pe-
riods or between terms. Tele-
phone calls are permissable dur-
ing‘ vacation periods or between
terms to make dates when
classes resume if the arrange-
ments are made within the two
week limit. No invitations by

to get the desired classes.
However, many students have
complained that they have not
heard from their advisers. Several
others stated that they went to
their advisers with full intention
of registering early, but were put
off.

Aware Of Problem

Hodges said that he was aware
of this problem and hoped to cor-
rect it. He did not say how.

Another complaint of students
that was voiced quite often was
that the names of teachers were
not included in the time sched-
ule.

Dr. Carl E. Wedeind, staff as-
sistant in the Office of Institute
Planning, explained that they
were not included mainly f or
practical reasons.
He said, “Most juniors and sen-
iors can ﬁnd out who is teaching
a speciﬁc course. from their ad-
visers, and the courses that ‘fresh-
man and sophomores are taking
are general enough that it doesn’t
matter.

sulted from omitting the teach-
er’s name enabled use of a

Rothman Named Publication Adviser

“In an informal setting, out-
side the classroom,” Rothman said,
“both the students and I will have
the opportunity to learn and ex-
pand academically.”

Work Challenges

“Working on a student publi-
cation involves a steady effort and
process of maturing both as a
writer and as a person.”

In this work Rothman realizes
that “student publications con-
stantly challenge the student to
perform and. maintain high
standards which require the
ability of rapid, .intense, and in-
tellectually honest writing.”

“As long as I am able to main-
tain _these standards to which Pitt
is accustomed, Rothman said, “I
feel that I will have done my
job.”

Councilmen Craig Kuhn and
James Jordon cast the only dis-
senting votes last week when the

plan to buy adjacent real estate

which would include off-street‘
parking space.

Dorm Plan Insufficient

The men objected that the dor-
mitory plan does not include suf-
ficient recreational and off-streetx
parking space for such a high
concentration of students.

Kuhn comented that he is
concerned because the city will

will be forced to spend more

tution. -

Walter E. Vieh, asistant chancel-
lor-emeritus told the Council that
the University's schedule for ac-
quiring aditional real estate is de-
pendent upon when it can raise
the money.

Vieh said that Oakland is not
a suitable place for a Univer-
sity, and that the Cathedral of
Learning is a “horrible thing to
operate.”

But he also pointed out that the
University has invested about
_$100,000 in Oakland real estate,
and cannot pick up and move.

The University also disclosed in
the Council meeting that it plans

Mock Election Offers

Preview

of Tuesday

By KATHY GIRANTV

Today all students have

an opportunity to cast their

vote for President of the United States in the 1960 Mock
Election. In the 1958 Mock Election the 600 students who
cast ballots reflected the actual election results.

In 1958 students gave the
publican Hugh D. Scott for

David L. Lawrence for Governoré

in the state-wide elections.

Scott held a strong 63 per cent
margin over, his Democratic op-
ponent, George M. Lezhier, with
37 per cent of the votes. Splitting
their ticket, students‘ gave guber-
natorial candidate, Lawrence 63
per cent to 37 per cent edge over
the Republicans Arthur McGon-
igle.

Thirteen other schools in
Western Pennsylvania partici-
pated in the election sponsored
by the Citizens Clearing House
under the chairmanship of Dr.
Edward Cooke.

Over 6400 students from Alli-
ance College, California State
Teachers College, Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, Chatham,
Duquesne and Gannon College
went to the polls.

Students from Indiana State
Teachers College, Mt. Mercy, St.
Francis, St. Vincent’s, Seton Hill,
Washington and Jefferson and
Westminster College also cast
votes. for their favorite candidate.
Lawrence and Scott dominated the
totals from all schools.

This year results from the in-
dividual institutions will be for-
warded to the CCH Regional

Headquarters here at the Univer-

sity where they will be tabulated
and announced on Friday.

 ‘CATHEDRAL was a scene of study for many  during‘
mid-term exams this week. \Vith first half of the trimester now
gone, thoughts of ﬁnal exams creep into the minds of students again.

Senior Class Tips Scales to Democrats

Senator Kennedy Holds Lead
In F i11al Pre-Election Polling

Senator John F.* Kennedy, Democratic presidential
nominee, retained a slim lead over Vice President Richard
M. Nixon in the fifth and final pre—election poll.

Students who participated in the weekly poll gave the
senator a 45 per cent to 42 per cent lead over Nixon, with
eight per cent undecided and five per cent having no opinion.

Kennedy was favored by 54 per’
cent of the male students Whilel
the female populus backed Nixon
with a 55 per cent margin.

Classes Pick Nixon

On a class basis Nixon held a 75

per cent lead with freshmen sup-

poi‘ting' him over Kennedy 45 per
cent to 41 per cent; sophomores,
56 per cent to 39 per cent, and
juniors, 47 per cent to 37 per cent.

The seniors’ 67 per cent to 17
per cent loyalty to Kennedy,
however, tipped the scales to
the side of the Democrats.

In the category of schools the
student body was almost evenly
divided: Liberal Arts, 48 per cent
to 39 per cent; Business Adminis-
tration. 48 per cent to 39 per cent;
and Engineering and Mines, 53
per cent to 36 per Cent went Ken-
nedy.

Nixon Favored

The Health Professions, 49 per
cent to 47 per cent and Graduate
students, 53 per cent to 36 per
cent favored Nixon. The School
of Education held a perfect bal-
ance between the candidates.

A running average for the en-
tire five weeks of the opinion
poll gave Kennedy a. four per-
centage point margin, 45 per
cent to 41 per cent.

The split in presidential prefer-
ence between male and female
students stayed constant through-
out the weekly polls. The males
on campus favored Kennedy by a
51 per cent to 49 per cent margin
while the coeds’ vote stayed with
Nixon, 52 per cent to 48 per cent.

Today, all students have an op-

the man of their choice in the
Mock Election. Polling places are
set up in the SU, the Cathedral,
and the Engineering and Mines
lounge.

By Beverly Roberts

Seven days remain before American voters go
to the polls. At this point Americans must realize
that the race for the presidency is not a question
of which man stands for what religion or what
political party, but which ‘man
himself is best qualiﬁed tolead
our nation as Chief Executive
and Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces. I A

How can we “evaluate” two
,men? The problem is not quite
so difﬁcult as it appears _on the
surface. One of the best ways
man has found to evaluate is
through experience. Admittedly
this is not, perhaps, the only or
the most accurate way of evalu-
ating. Without powers of omniscience, however,

_ this is the most revealing method man can use.

Freshman Comparisons H
Comparison of past activities of Senator John

F..Kennedy and Vice—President Richard M. Nixon

‘ might well begin in 1946 when both men were

freshman Congressmen.

Kennedy loped along in anomymity; Congress-
man Nixon hit the nation’s front pages during his
very first term, as he pursued the Alger Hiss case
as a member of the House Un-American Activities
Committee. In this same term in Congress, Nixon
supported Harry Truman’s program of aid to Com-
munist—menaced Greece and Turkey, and he has
remained a steadfast backer of foreign aid.

It was Nixon’s record of capability and intense

as ,Vice-President in 1952. President Eisenhower’s
military training made him realize that the second
in command must be trained to take over’ in case
of accident.

Nixon Was There

Accordingly, from the start, Nixon sat at the
councils of the Administration, learned its secrets,
shared in its decisions, presided at meetings of
both the Cabinet and the National Security Council
when Eisenhower was absent.

Indicative of the experience the Vice President
has in foreign affairs is the fact that he has made
nine ofﬁcial trips abroad, covering a total of 159,-

tory for freedom in Iran, Trieste, in Austria, in
Guatemala, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in Laos, in
Cambodia, in West Berlin, in Africa. He has re-
tained dignity with ﬁrmness in dealing personally
with Khrushchev. '

The fact ,that Kennedy’s past eight years in the
Senate do not begin to measure up to the respon-

, sibility Nixon has held as Vice President is evi-

denced by his lack of knowledge and good judg-
ment in matters of foreign policy. Three times in

_ the last few months we have observed Senator,’-

Kennedy as he gives us examples of what his be- 
havior would be as President, and the gross errors "

he would have made.
Ike Sfonds_Firm . ‘

First, after the U—2 incident, Senator Kennedy
wanted, the President to send his “apologies” to
Khrushchev. Eisenhower, rather than apologizing
for protecting the country, made it clear that the
United States would continue to take all possible
measures to guard the security of the ‘nation and
that it wouldbe disastrous to American prestige
to apologize for taking the all-important security
measures.

Again, on the subject of Quemoy and Matsu,
Kennedy demonstrated his .imprudence to the’
American people when he made public, for all the
world including the Communists to hear, that he

would not defend these areas in the event of a

Communist aggression.
Kennedy "Goofs" Again
Mr. Kennedy took a third opportunity to
demonstrate his lack of experience and responsi-
bility when he announced his stand on the Cuban
situation. His position of aiding anti—Castro rebels
is in open deﬁance of several Latin-American
treaties, and the United Nations Charter.

Despite Newspaper,
E&M‘ Cabinet Works

Editor, The Pitt News:
The.Pitt News of October 19,
1960 contained an article en-
titled ‘‘Only A Facade” which
began: “Nothing is ever accom-
, plished at the University by any
‘of the student governing bodies.”
We feel that this is an unjust
statement and wish to take for-
mal exception to it at this time,
because we know there is at
least one student organization on
campus that does do something.
We refer to the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet. _
The E&M Cabinet is composed

A

of one elected representative
‘from each class of all the
Schools of Engineering a n d

Mines——a total of 32. This group
and its adviser, Dr. Edward B.

Stuart, meets every week of the _

trimester — with the possible
exception of the first and last —
to plan a schedule of events for
the entire School of Engineering
and Mines and it is rare indeed
when / less than 25 of the 32
members appear.

At present we are planning
the annual “Fall Ball’’ to be held
at West View Danceland, No-
vember 11, and another social
event will be held in early De-
cember. We also have a complete
sports schedule to cover all sea-
sons of the year.

In’ September 1959, the E&M
Cabinet organized the ﬁrst stu-
dent operated book exchange on
campus, and it has proved to be
a terriﬁc money—saver to us

, “poor” students. '

W gives an outstanding student, or
students, the opportunity to
travel and work abroad during
the summer between his junior
and senior years.

Still another achievement is
Engineers’ Week which occurs
annually during the winter tri-
mester. At the time, each de-
partment sets up displays, work-
ing labs, and other such exhib-
its pertaining to engineering
which we feel are interesting to
the general public and which
will be beneﬁcial to the students
erecting them.

There are many other things
that E&M Cabinet has accom-
plished —— outstanding senior,
outstanding seminar, s p o r t s
champions, E&M Bulletin, Sky-
scraper Engineer, but we won’t
attempt to describe them all be-
cause we feel our purpose has
been accomplished, and that. was
to prove the statement, “Nothing
is ever accomplished at the Uni-
versity' by any of the . student-
governing bodies.” to be false.

At least it’s false if the school

sidered a part of the University.

cype of “democracy” that actual-
ly exists.

Although our university is lo-
cated in the North, there are so-
cial ills extant. .While fraterni-
ties and sororities are allowed to
retain discriminatory clauses in
their charters barring fellow
students because of racial or re-
ligious differences; and while the
surrounding university commu-
nity unobstructively follows an
undemocratic policy of facilities
(yes, in Pittsburghl); then we
realize that we are not much
better than many “unprogres-
sive” Southern areas.

It is the job of our organiza-
tion to expose such conditions
and change them.

There is a second‘ factor to
consider also. The college chap-
ter of N.A.A.C.P. has a second-
ary purpose. Along with the agi-
tation for the rights of all min-
ority groups, our organization
acts as an educational source.

During the course of N.A.A.
C.P.’s campus life, we have had
speakers from various walks of
life presenting topics of general
appeal to the students.

This year we plan to have stu-
dents from Africa, Korea, and
India as speakers in an effort to
spread a genuine appreciation
and understanding of other cul-
tures. We believe that as college
students and future leaders of

society, we must be educated in
the full and true meaning of
toleration, equality and civil li-
berties.

Lastly, it is important to real-
ize that the college chapter of
the N.A.A.C.P. is entirely -a stu-
dent organization. We are not an
extended arm of the parent or-
ganization.

Student Discusses

Honor Code Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wish to express agreement
with Mr. Ronald Caplan, whose
letter appeared in the October
24 issue of The Pitt News. If a
student comes to this Institution
knowing that academic excell-
ence, and not superior eyesight,
is required of him, he will either
meet the expectations or be ask-
ed to resign.

But even this silver lining is
not without its cloud, for the
Administration will be reproved
for establishing moral standards
of intellectual achievement,
hence limiting the students’ free-
dom by placing upon them a
quasi-religious ethic.

The basic question, “is cheat-

and evaluation. Let it here be
said, if no where else, that per-
haps if the university, the com-
munity of the enlightened, is not
interested in teaching morality
and the difference between right
and wrong, few other groups
can hope to do it. Virtuous,
ethical behavior is not too much
to as of the student pursuing
scholarship and enlightenment.

Bus. Ad. Maiors Not

Informed of Election

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was surprised to discover
that within the last few weeks,
candidates were selected, nomi-
nations circulated and elections
held for the vacant positions in
the Business Administration
Cabinet.‘

Its purpose as stated in the

‘Wednesday. _ ,
course book of the School ‘ is,
“promotion of student identiﬁca-
tion with the School of Business
Administration; provision of an
official channel of communica-
tion among students, ‘the aca-
demic dean and faculty mem-
bers; and provisions of an or-
ganization by which student in-
terests may be expressed and
school activities may be planned
and implemented.”

In my opinion each of these
aims has been violated in the
secretive manner in which this

“election” has been conducted.

For the classes involved had no
information of the impending
election, either as to the method
of running for office or the place
and time of the election.

Either the present procedure
must be changed or, if this is
too much trouble, a new system
must be initiated to permit an-
other means of selection.

pl-Silone’: “Fontamara’ 

Social-‘Protest Novel

Holds Strong Ideas

By WILLIAM BENNETT

» , Most sociaI—protest novels live short lives. When the
causes theyeso ardently champion die out or lose their‘ im-
mediate importance, the novels, left stripped of their virtue
asﬁlsocial sermons, soon go down the road to obscurity.

[ It is interesting, then, to note that one of the first offer-

ings of the recently founded Atheneum Publishers is a re-

" issue of social-protest novel writ—-‘-

ten? in the 4 1930's. Like “The
Grapes of Wrath,” Ignazio Si-
lone’s “Fontamara” (440 pp.,

$4.00) seems to_ be an exception
to an old and ‘harsh rule.

Why? Perhaps it is because
“Fontamara’s” p r 0 t e s t against
government oppression is still
strong enough to keepthe read-

because Silone is enough of a

genius to put his novel as such

ﬁrst, his message second.
Characters Make Protest

He has accomplished this, by
keeping his editorializing within
the context of the story. The pro-
test is made by the characters
in their own language not by Si-
lone in his position of omniscient
guide and creator.

Silone’s story is a modern
version of the old Italian fable
of the peasants and the Devil.
There is an extra measure of
tragic irony in this when we
realize that “Fontamara” does
not end with crafty peasants
sending the Devil packing, but
with the Devil triumphant.

And the Fascist Devil is not the
only one in control as the story
ends; heartbreaking pessimism
accompanies him. The «peasants,
their hopes and hero destroyed,
reach the ultimate ddpths of de-
spair. Fontamara’s last lines are
a desperate cry: “What Can We

Idealistic Hero

The hero is Berardo Viola, the
smartest and therefore the most
discontented, man in Fontamara.
In many ways he is Silone him-
self, an idealist trying to rally
the uncomprehending to the reali-
zation that their salvation lies in
their own hands. .
Berardo does not remain an
idelaist long. His idealism has

noring his friends’ pleas to stay,

has for years eluded Mussolini’s

Now that he is in jail on some
petty charge, it is only a matter
of time until the police discover
who they have in their hands.
Berardo makes the desperate de-
cision to hem The Solitary
Stranger escape by ,, claiming
that he is the wanted man.

Berard0’s martyrdom is the
only ray of optimism in the en-
tire novel; and even it is offset by
the ﬁnal tragedy. The Stranger’s

mara, is discovered. The town is
destroyed, the population killed
or scattered.

If, like “King Lear,” this novel

Carlos, Notorious Latin

‘Student’,Defrauds Girls

By TOM McGOVEB.N ‘
The University Police have been alerted for the possible
arrivalon this campus of an enterprising young imposter
who specializes in defrauding co-eds of their lunch money.

This roguish adventurer,

who customarily represents

himself as an international student from Latin America, has

During the week of Sept. 19,

Carlos, whose last name is un-
known, appeared at Toledo Uni-
versity.
Coeds Contacted

He contacted a number of wo-
men students on the - campus,
claiming to be the President of
the International Students Asso-
ciation at Ohio State University
and invited them to serve as hos-
tesses at “a st.ate—wide meeting of
foreign students” which was to
take place Oct. 1 and 2 at Ohio

_K‘ State.

The plan, as explained to the
co-eds, was that they were to
attend an afternoon football
game in Columbus, followed by
a cocktail party and dinner
dance to which they would be
escorted by students of an un-
named Mexican military acad-
emy. V

Each of the girls‘ was to receive
$25 for acting as a hostess. Carlos
then solicited small sums of
money from them, promising to
return in several days to make

advance payment of the $25. He
 has not returned, and Ohio State

Roberto Returns

The description of Carlos, while
very incomplete, coincide remark-
ably. with those of one ‘Roberto
Gonzales’ who perpetrated a sim-
ilar hoax at Ohio State last.
October, and it is believed that

both ‘Carlos’ and ‘Roberto’ may
be the same person.
Roberto, however, was

_ . ’‘ reported to be a bit bolder and
 more dashing than Carlos in the

' Introducing himself as an Ohio

State student from Mexico, Ro-
berto solicited money from a
number of business establish-
ments in Columbus, ostensibly for
. the purpose of helping to defray
the expenses of a Pan American
Program to be held in the Ohio

Hostesses Needed
Next, posing as a student from
/‘ another unnamed university, he
/"’ extended his depredations to the

vited another batch of female stu-
dents to act as hostesses, this time

Even though modern electronic computers work at al-
most unbelievable speeds. the scientist is way ahead

of them.

Put quite simply, scientists have been thinking up com-
plex problems faster than even the fastest computers
could handle them. To close this gap, IBM created
STRETCH, the world's fastest. most powerful computer.

The first STRETCH system will go to the AEC at Los
Alamos to aid in nuclear reactor design. This goliath can
do a million additions or subtractions a second. It can
“read" the equivalent of four million characters per
minute from magnetic tape. It can print the equivalent
of three good-sizedsnovels: every hour. It can perform
all these operations simultaneously, and if necessary

AP Votes Cats
14111 in Nation
On 3-2-2 Slate

By JACK SMITH

“Now to Notre Dame” is the
cry as the Panthers, ranked
number 14 in the nation by
the Associated Press Ratings,
prepare for the Fighting Irish
this Saturday «at South Bend,

Indiana.

Although the Irish have an un-
impressive 1-5 slate in six starts
and are playing with a team load-
ed with experienced sophomores,
the Panthers aren't taking the un-
predictable gridders lightly.

“We would be foolish to under-
estimate this team,” Coach John
Michelosen said. “They have a
better team than most people
think.”

“They lost the ball ﬁve times
inside Navy's twenty yard line.
last Saturday,” Captain Mike
Ditka said. “If they would have
capitalized on those chances
they would have beaten Navy.”

Many football fans are expect-
ing a letdown by the Panthers
after upsetting favored Syracuse.
This combined with the saying
that Notre Dame is 25% stronger
on their home ﬁeld could spell
trouble for the Panthers who are
riding high after last Satu'rday’s
win. M

A win over the Blue and Gold
would _more than please the Irish
who, according to Ditka, have
been gunning for the Cats all
season. '

For the last two years the
Panthers have beaten the Irish.
Last year they won 28-13.

The next three games are a
must for the Panthers if they
hope to improve on their present
3-2-2 record and continue their
national recognition.

By virtue of their win , over
Syracuse the Panthers are ranked
third in the race for the Lambert
Trophy, the trophy that signiﬁes
All-East supremacy. Navy and
Syracuse are presently tied for
first place. _,

However, the Panthers are fac-
ing a serious problem with in-
juries. Regis Coustillac and Paul
Hodge may be out of action with
leg injuries, leaving the Panthers
shallowat left guard. End Woody
Hazer is also hampered with a
knee injury.

Basketball, Mat
Teams Prepare

For Openers

Two of the Panther athletic
teams, basketball and wrestling,
-are busy preparing‘ for their sea-
-son openers which will come in
December. .

The hoopers have been prac-
ticing since Nov. 15 and will
open with Purdue Dec. 2. The
matmen held their ﬁrst drill last
Monday and will start the sea-.
son with a pre-season appear-
ance in the Wilkes tournament..

Coaches Bob Timmons and Rex
Peery have hopes of banner years

 

worries.

RON DELFINE, senior end from Canonsburg played an outstanding
game on defense last Saturday at Syracuse. “Runt” as he is known
by his friends is one half of the Dalton Boys with Mike Ditka
the other. Each week they cause the opposing quarterbacks many

 

Saturday.

West Chester have met. West
Chester handed Howard its only
defeat of the season while the
Blue and Gold suffered a 3-1 de-
feat.

Both games were similar in
their scripts. The better condition-
ing of the Panthers and West
Chester proved to be the domi-
nating factor in the second half
of both games against Howard.

Punch Active

The excellent performance that
the booters have put forth in their
last two games makes the soccer
fans think that West Chester may
be knocked from the undefeated
ranks when they encounter the
Golden Panthers.

The showing that Corky Cuth-
bcrt made in the ‘few minutes
of action that he saw against
Howard and the par excellence
playing of Pete Smith in the
same game has led the booters
to believe that now- they can
.mount the same scoring threat
that they had in pre-season
competition.

For once the booters will go
into the game without being heav-
ily hindered by injuries. The only
injury to the Panthers now is Ron
Prado.

for their squads.

_, By JOHN FLEMING

After making a ﬁne showing in their last outing, the
Blue and Gold booters will be put to the real test when they
meet undefeated West Chester

x

at 1:30 on the Practice Field,

This will be the ﬁrst time that these two teams will
meet on the soccer ﬁeld. Howard is the only common oppo-

nent that both the Panthers andé

Chuck Dunbar, who has ﬁlled
in for Prado, has done surpris-
ingly well. Dunbar’s ‘s p e e d has
proved to be an asset to the team
in these last few games.

“West Chester is bound to be
tough,” commented Coach Bemis.
“Their undefeated record proves
that/they must have something.
I think that with Corky and,
Pete playing as well as they did
against Howard, we just might
beat this West Chester team.”

Cure Ills of Cats With

- 42 Years Experience
’ . ~ By‘ JIM O’BRIEN

first-aid is the category
team trainers
Howard Waite and Roger Mc-
Gill in the University’s ath-

gnletic department. Their prime

functionis to cure the ills of
Panther athletes.

In a medicinal environment of
whirlpool baths, ointments
bandages, they do everything but
operate on their patients.

Both men are well equipped to
handle their ‘tasks with 42 years of

C combined experience. Head train-

.er Waite, serving his 20th year,
obtained his B.S. degree in educa-
tion from Illinois University in
1930, where he was a part-time

’/‘trainer.

Service Experience

‘Waite worked earlier for ﬁve
year periods for both Colorado
College and Colorado University.
He was also a lieutenant com-
mander in the Navy, participating
:,in the V-5 program, headed by
.Captain Tom Hamilton, former
Athletic Director.

.McGill served as a student
trainer under Waite in 1948. He
obtained a B.S. degree in 1950,
and a Masters degree in 1951.

Roger, who served in the Ma-

rine Corps, worked in the Vet’s
Hospital recently. He served 536
hours in the clinic, qualifying as a
physical therapist. He heads the
new corrective therapy -program
for rehabilitation of students with
physical defects. He is a physical
education instructor, conducting
gym classes also.

Ref Retaliated

Present AD Frank C/arver says,
‘.‘We are lucky to have them. We
wouldn’t trade them for any team
in the country. They are ﬁne
morale builders and good ‘repre-
sentatives of the school.”

During the 1957 Minnesota
game, Waite hollered about the

Gophers piling on diminutive
.Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi. The ref
metaliated, “Get the hell off the
ﬁeld. You’re not the coach.”
Waite replied, “Yeh, Doc, but I
have to take care of that little
fellow.” ’

Waite doesn’t run out on the
football ﬁeld any more. After the
1954 Penn State contest, Lineman’
trampled him,
running to the dressing room.
Howard suffered a broken hip.

Rescue Quarterback

‘In 1956 Mcgill went to the res-
cue of “blind” Quarterback
“Corny” Salvaterra who had
something in his eye. McGill said,
“I tried to dig a speck out. After
avwhile, “Corny” laughed, ‘Roger
are you trying to get that red dot
out.’ I said yeh! Corny explained,
‘that’s to tel‘1"my contact lenses

A apart.” T T »
Waite classiﬁes athlete in
three types. He commented,

“Some _kids don’t tell me when
'they’re hurt, because they are
afraid they won’t play. Most of
them tell you, but some are
hypocondriacs, always in pain.
For those guys you have to be a.
psychologist, a psychiatrist, and
a nurse.” .
" Woody Haser, who missed most
of last season because. of a
shoulder injury, credits the train-
ers for his recovery. He added,

 , “We’re very close to them. When

 

'we’re hurt, they tape us up, and
joke around so we’lliforget about
it."

Besides being close to the play-
ers, they have the ability tolinstill
in them conﬁdence and fair play.
Under their. care and guidance the
sports program will continue to be
based on principles of fair play
and good sportsmanship, and fu-

ture players, will come to regaifdj

Cat Cubs Meet Navy

By MARSHALL ROMEO
The f r e s h m a n gridders
travel to Navy Saturday for
their ﬁnal game of the sea-
son. Coach Lou “Bimbo” Cec-

coni’s crew will be taking an
unmarked s 1 a t e into the
game. The only disappointment of
the season has been the blemish
that Penn State caused when they
scored" against the Panther cubs
last Friday. ‘
With Navy the Cats will have
their hands full as the p1ebes_al-
ways come up with a good team.
“The Middies are always in good
shape and usually have tremenr
dous depth,” said Cecconi, “I will
have to use two complete units
to compete with them.” .
The only change in Cecconi’s
lineup will be the return of Gerry
Cherry who missed the State
game because of a broken nose.
Jack Price, a hard hitting guard,
will be a doubtful starter and his

slot will probably be ﬁlled by the
versatile Ray Popp.

Popp was originally a full-
back but has seen action at
guard, tackle, center and full-
back on offense. On defense he
has played linebacker and mid-
dle guard.

Cecconi is happy with the im-

. provement of his ends Gene So-

bolewski and Al Grigaliunas.
Grigaliunas and Sobbie both scor-
ed their ﬁrst touchdowns last
week, although Grigaliunas had
scored on numerous extra points.

THE PARTY WEEKEND: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

With the season of party weekends almost upon us, my mail of

late has been ﬂooded with queries from young inmates of women’s

colleges wishing to know how one conducts one’s self when one

has invited a young gentleman for a weekend, so let us today
-take up this burning issue.

Well, my dear girls,’the first thing to remember is that your
young gentleman is far from home and frightened. Put him at
hisvease; You might, for instance, surprise him by having his
mother sitting in a rocker on the station platform when he gets
off the train.

Next, what kind of corsage should you send your young gentle-
man? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are always acceptable.
So, indeed, are phlox and delphinium. In fact, most any ﬂora
will serve. Do try, however, to avoid carnivorous plants.

If you ﬁnd, my esteemed ﬁllies, that your local ﬂorist has run
out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a corsage out of paper.
But pick good, stiff, durable paper—twenty dollar bills, for
example.

Remem.ber at all times, my fond wenches, to show your young
gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open doors for him,
walk on the traffic side of the path, assist him to the punch bowl,
zip his parka, light his Marlboros. (What, you ask, if he doesn’t
smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course,
he smokes Marlboros! Don’t you? Don’t I? Doesn't everybody
who knows a hawk from a handsaw? What other cigarette
gives you such a lot to like? Such easy-drawing ﬁltration? Such
unﬁltered taste? Such soft pack or ﬂip-top box? No other, my
sweet minxes, no other. Marlboro stands alone, and any man
worthy of you, my estimable damsels, is bound to be a Marlboro
man.) ~ ‘

  

Sllflirzlf

If you will follow the simple instructions stated above, my
good lasses, you will ﬁnd that you have turned your young
gentleman into a fast and fervent admirer. There is nothing
quite like a party weekend to promote romance. I am in mind
of a party weekend some years ago at Miss Pomfritt’s Seminary
for well-born females in West Linotype, Ohio. Seraﬁna Sigafoos,
a sophomore at this institution, majoring in napkin folding, sent
an invitation to a young man named Fafnir Valve, a junior at
the Joyce Kilmer School of Forestry, majoring in sap and boles.
Seraﬁna had been ape for Fafnir since high school, but Fafnir
preferred a girl named Gelia Flesliwbund, the high school drum
majorette who once threw a baton so high she impaled a south-
bound mallard.

Anyhow, Seraﬁna sent an invitation to Fafnir, and he came,
and she showered him with kindness and cuff links, and then
he went away, and Seraﬁna sat anxiously by the mailbox,
wondering whether she would ever hear from him again. Sure
enough, two weeks later she got a. letter: “Dear Seraﬁna, Can
you let me have ﬁfty bucks? ’ours, Fafnir.” '

Whimpering with ecstasy, she ran to the bank and withdrew
the money and mailed it to him. From then on, she got the
same request every week, and as a result, she became very well
acquainted with Ralph T. Involute, teller of the West Linotype
Bank and Trust Co., and their friendship ripened into love, and
today they are happily married and live in St-amen, Oregon,
where Ralph is in the extruded molasses game and Seraﬁna
is a hydrant.

Every weekend is a party weekend with 1kIarlboros———or Marl-
boro’s unﬁltered companion cigarette-—mild, ﬂavorful Philip
Morris. Try the newest Philip Morris——the sensational king-
size Commander. Have a Commantler—welcome aboard!

Notre Dame, Pitt and foot-

Notre Dame with its great tra-
dition of Knute Rockne, George

butt heads with the Panthers, a
newly awakened team after its'up-

Reading the Notre Dame
coaching staff is Joe Kuharick,
a former head coach of the
Pittsburgh Steelers and the
Washington Red Skins. Also on
the Notre Dame coaching staff is
Bill Daddio, once an All-Amer-
ican end for the Panthers..

Notre Dame’s, like the Cats C-
boys, have a H.S.S. combination
that not only stands for Haffner,
Scarpitto and Sefcik, but also for
«a Hot passing arm, a Scamping
halfback and a Scotting pass re-
ceiver.

Out of the last four games the

Panther Harriers
Close Out Season

With NYU Violets

Panther harriers face the N.Y.U.
Violets this Saturday on the Van
Courtland Park course in New
York. In the ﬁnal dual meet of
the season, they will have a final
opportunity to bring their record
to a respectable level. V

The Violets beat the Panthers
last year on the Schenley Park
course and should prove rough on
their own “hunting grounds.”
Fran]! Levin broke the existing
course record last year when he
ranvthe Flagstoft Course in 22:07.9
as the N.Y.U. men scored a 22-
36 win.

Right behind ace Cat Ron
Rush, who ﬁnished second was
Jim Brown in a blazing 22:48
which also eclipsed the old
standard. Brown is back to
haunt Coach Carl Rees again.
The other threat facing the vis-
itors will be the presence of
rugged Irishman Joe Dugan, a
grizzled veteran from the Em-
erald Isle.

The only two lettermen on the

. Rees’ team are co-captains Bill

Hinchberger and Reed Clark, who
have foundered behind, the heels
of other runners all. season.
Against the Violets._last year,
Hinchberger was fourth and
Clarke was eighth. Neither man
has neared these performances so

far this year.

Concerning another complaint
of students, Wedekind said, “The

“This is what we predicate our

by which we select courses to be

“With this information we
judge what courses to oﬁer the

Spring term in order that they
will not be disappointed if the

Wedekind added, “There will be
many more intensive courses of-

the choice as to what they will
be will depend on how these stu-
dents ﬁll out their registration

Dear Dr. Frood: Here is a controversial bridge hand played at
a recent college tournament. The contract was six no-trump.

the contract. What would you do with a hand like this?
