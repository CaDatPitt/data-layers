forthis inter-campus communication. Names and addresses
of various student leaders were exchanged.

The much discussed damage rally pact was brought up
but a misconception in the wording resulted in a delay in

submit their approval.

Herman stated that neither Mount Mercy nor PCW

The possibility of a student discount for purchases in
the Oakland area was also mentioned but SC has not as

into this possibility.

Paul Petro, assemblies chair-°
man, pointed out the need for stu-
dent enthusiasm for the final pep
‘rally of the year prior to the Penn
‘State game. “This rally is mainly
’to honor the seniors who will be
playing their last game for the
University.” ' 4

Bob Sedler, public relations
chairman, proposed that SC un-
dertake the publication of a Stu-
dent Government handbook de-
signed to acquaint the student
with his government within the
University. The book would be
similar to that published last
year and would include a defini-
tion of Congress, Men’s Coun-

Publications Lounge
Planned by Pi Delt
For Pitt News Hall

Initial plans for decoration
of a publicationsrlounge and
Pitt News office by Pi Delta
Epsilon, national honorary
journalism _fraternity,
been announced.

Money has been set aside
fromthe reserve funds of the
Pitt News and Owl to furnish
these offices on the eighth ﬂoor.
An interior decorator from Kauf-
mann’s Department Store recently
discussed the change with Dr.
Donald E. Swarts, director of pub-
lications and members of Pi Delt.

The lounge will be furnished in
modern style, "with sofas and
chairs, rugs, tables, and lamps. An
estimate on price and plans will
be announced after approval by
Dr. Swarts and Pi Delt.

Plans for the lounge are to be
similiar to the Ohio State Stu-
dent Union Lounge. It will extend
the length of the corridor from
Dr. Swarts’ oﬁice to the main hall
on the eighth floor.

Pi Delta Epsilon has also an-
nounced that the Pitt News oﬁice
will be decorated shortly with
bamboo window blinds, draperies,
and other modern features to
blend with the ew furnishings

Progress for the Year

Progress of Men’s Council was outlined Monday, Nov. 9,
for members of Student, Congress by Robert Wilkins, presis
dent of Men’s Council. Main projects for this semester’ have
included administration of Men’s Conference, sponsorship
of mixer dances and football movies of Pitt games, and the
planning of High, School Day. _

‘ Wilkins explained that Council works through eight
standing committees. Every member of Council is on one
of. these committees.

During early September, the Social committee held a
retreat for Men’s Council at the Wilkins’ cottage in Ligomer.
They have sponsored three mixer:
dances and plan to hold three more

Administration of Men’s Confer-
ence, council’s main project for
this semester, was instrumented by
the Freshman Relations committee.

Coroso, the University Social Com-
mittée and to the Publication, Stu-

dent Congress, and Intramural
Sports boards.

WSGA consented to aid in the
compilation of this book. .
Sedler also proposed the forma-
tion of a speaker’s bureau for pub-
liciing SC,to the various clubs and
organizations at Pitt. Under this
plan, each member of Congress
would speak before a number of
groups.
Dean Helen P. Rush suggested

that Sedler wait until the student .

government handbooks cameout
and then use them in the talks.

She further suggested that a round '

table discussion might serve to en-
lighten the members of Congress
on some of the questions with
which they might be confronted in
their discussion groups.

Secretary Pat Woods read the
report on SC’s retreat,_he1d Oct.
31, which stated four points in the
physical environment of Congress:

(1) SC should consider immedi-
ate environment such as
lighting and seating and do
what is possible to improve
them.

Student life would benefit
from a building program in-

(2)

eluding dormatories and a .

student union. '
Present facilities such as the
Tuck Shop and the Cafe-
teria need improvement.

SC should_be aware of their
physical environment and
should strive to merit con-
sultation.

Miss Rush stated at the retreat
that, ‘The success of any organi-
zation depends on the three P’s——
Philosophy, Program, and Pas-
sion.” She reminded Congress
that enthusiasm, or passion, is nec-
esary for success.

Members mentored the freshman

of freshman ties and the freshman-
sophomore tug of war.

The addition of the three fresh-
man presidents brought Council
membership up to a total of 30.

The Public Relations committee
handles releases to the News and
Owl. It will cooperate with Stu-
dent Congress and WSGA in pub-
lishing a student government book‘
let for Student Government Day.

High School Day, blazer promo-
tion, student elections, and a loan
fund are part of the work‘ han— '
dled by the Student Relation Com-

commission looking into the ‘two’-
party political system of other
Universities to ascertain its po-
tentialities at Pitt.‘ ,’

The Eighth Floor committee
acquired the television set for the
World Series showing at Pitt. It
sponsors rental of a PA system,
movie projector, and record player.

Dr. Wm. Edwards

Takes Students to

Sub-Tropic Zone

By GENE FARKAS
‘ The first archaeological expedi-
tion sponsored by the University
of Pittsburgh took place this sum-

'mer when six Pitt students and

a professor ventured into sub-
tropical Florida.

Tangible results of this two-
month venture are contained in
boxes piled in a room on the 23rd
floor of the Cathedral. These car-
tons are filed with stones and
bones collected from the "Florida
swamps. A

During coming months, this as-
sortment of archaeological evi-
dence will be cleaned, analyzed",
and catalogued under the supervi-
sion of Pitt’s anthropoligist and
leader of the expedition, Dr. Wil-
liam E. Edwards. When he is
through, Dr. ,Edwards hopes to
have pieced together another im-
portant chapter in the story of
early man on the North American
continent. -

Professor Edwards took with
him his wife; Dr. Ernst Borinski,
a, former Pitt graduate student;
Gene Farkas, senior; Ed Mc-
Michael, junior; and Art Saxon,
Ed Glen, and Carl Regutti, sopho-
mores. Each member was picked
by Dr. Edwards from a number
of Pitt students interviewed by
him’ last spring. Each student re-
ceived eight credits for the course.

75 Miles Covered

The enterprise began the first
week in July when members as-
sembled in the city of Lakeland,
30 miles east ‘of Tampa in the
heart of west central F'lorida’s
citrue belt. The base of operations
was an eight-room house in Lake-
land’s residential district. From
the countryside for
seventy-five miles around was
covered. 

The group, dressed in khaki
trousers, T-shirts, and straw
hats, squeezed’ into a black,
hearse-like 1939 Buick, and
cruised along the roads study-
ing the land for glinting pieces
of flint, signs of ancient Indian
sites. Frequent stops were made

' pat likely spots such as road cuts,

stream beds, phosphate wastes,
rivers and hills.

The first day, the expedition
spied a hill in the distance. Be-
cause hills are so rare in flat Flori-
da, they rushed over to investigate.
One of the young would-be arch-
aeologists. picked up what he took
for a large fossilized sex shell.
Professor gently informed him it
was a “fossil” ordinarily left be-
hind by cattle. .

This was not the only run-in
with the state’s numerous steers.
Several weeks later some of the
group who were crossing a pas-
ture met a pair of bulls. They
reached the fence just ahead of

V the bulls.

After locating‘ a promising In-

dian site, the archaeologists dug‘

standard five-foot square test pits.
Excavating involves strictly Stone

Age procedure——the application of

cave-man muscle to a shovel. For-
tunately, Florida is mostly. sand.

The expedition party stayed in
the Florida area for two months.

shovelful was sifted
screens to catch the
smallest particles of ﬂint and
charcoal. Digging continued un-
til the bottom of the “cultural
material” was r eac h ed. The
water table is very high in low-
lying, ‘swampy Florida. In some
places water began flooding the
pits when only a depth of two
or three feet had been reached.
Luckily, everyone knew how to
swim. _
Because Florida has a large
poisonous snake population, stu-
dents were warned to watch where
they stepped. Three weeks passed
before a poisonous reptile was
spotted, andthen the poor crea-
ture didn't have a chance. It was a
small pygmy rattlesnake which
was quickly disposed of.
Pits Filled In
Another snake incident occurred
when a harmless five-foot King
snake slipped into a hole where
Ed Glenn, Pitt News Photo Edi-
tor, was working. Ed took one
look at thevsnake and took off
for places unknown. .
The last stage of working a site
includes the sketching and photo-
graphing of soil profiles. Soil sam-
ples were also taken from pit
walls. This procedure’ helps to
establish the age of material found
in the pit.

Every
through

When a site was closed out,
excavations had to be filled in.
At one point, so eager were the
students to move on to virgin
ground that they began shovel-
ing earth into a pit‘ while the
professor was still taking final
notes. V

All time spent was not spent
surveying and excavating, how-
ever. There were occasional side
trips such as an excursion down
the Silver Springs river in search
of ancient Indian‘ shell mounds.
The motorboat journey wound
through a jungle of strange birds,
fish, alligators, and tropical flow-
ers. There were several other
weekend trips to islands of Flori-
da’s Gulf‘ coast.

World Understanding

Foreign Students Enrolled for
Graduate Work in Public Health

By CECY LINCOFF
(Editor’s Note: This is the last in a series of articles onthe
various schools within the University.) . ’

“Students from other countries” are enrolled in the Uni-
versity’s Graduate School of Public Health. “This,” says
Dr. Thomas Parran, dean of the school, “contributes to inter-
national understanding and good will.”

Seventy—four students are enrolled in the school this

' year, some part time, and others working fortheir masters

or doctorate degrees.

Masters degrees are granted in
public health and science. Both of
these degrees required one aca-
demic year spent by the student
in residence.

Students Sponsored ’

The majority of Pitt p u b l i c
health students are sponsored by
their employees, future or present.
The only exceptions to this are
those in hospital administration
training. ~«

These students participate in a
two year course, the first at the
school in the Municipal Hospital,
the second in a supervised resi-
dency at a hospital. In the lat-
ter the student holds an admin-
istrative job with the hospital.

As in most graduate schogls, an

maintained with students by. fac-
ulty. A chief counselor is available
at all times ‘and he in turn may
ask the assistance of any junior
faculty member.
Placement No Problem

A “central core program” is fol-
lowed by the public health stu-
dent. This program is a block
schedule plan.

Placement of graduates is no
problem. Many positions are
available in occupational health,
engineering, and nursing for
public health graduates.

ties associated with the school.

Students interested in re-
porting for the Pitt News

Grant froin Mellon

One of ten public health gradu-
ate schools in the United States,
Pitt’s was made possible in 1948 by
a grant of 14 milion dollars from
the A. W. Mellon Educational and

Five million dollars from this
grant is being used to construct
the new health building. .,

The Graduate Schol (of Public

Bleauat Arts Interprets M J
Art With Pitt Players, M en’s
Glee Club, Chorale, Dancers  

An interpretation of modern art styles through drama,

dance, and music is the. aim

of Beaux Arts sponsored by

Women’s Speech Association with the cooperation of Women’s

Chorale, Men’s Glee Club, ‘Pitt Players, and Women’s Re- .

creation Association.

This year’s theme, “Beaux Arts Moderne,” with‘em-

phasis on the ultra modern, will be

presented Thursday, Nov.

18 from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. in Stephené

Foster Memorial. Beaux Arts will
introduce ideas about cubistic, ab-
stractionistic, and expressionistic
art. Each phase will be expounded
through a medium of creative ex—~
pression. ‘

Cubistic Ideas Developed

Women’s Chorale will develop
cubistic ideas through song. Pitt
Players will present the drama,
“Mr. Zero” to present expression-
ism. Through a modern dance
presentation, participants W ill‘
demonstrate abstractionism.

According to Elaine Masamed,
publicity chairman, “Beaux Arts
was originally conceived to hon-
or freshman women. Since its
origin, the program has expand-
ed to encompass the entire uni-
versity.”

Carolyn Streiner, Col. ’56, has
prepared the choreography for the
ballet. Music for the show was

composed by Lloyd Kropp, Col. ’56.
Themes Vary

Beaux Arts themes vary from
year to year in an effort to intro-
duce, to students, classical arts in
a university setting. Last year’s
theme was a comparison of art 50
years ago with that of today. Two.
years ago, the group featured “The
Art of Pittsburgh.” This year, for
the ﬁrst time, other Pitt organiza-
tions will play major roles‘ in the
presentation. '

All students and faculty are in-
vited to attend. Admission is free.
Refreshments will be served at the
conclusion of the program. Miss
Barbara M'cIntyi‘e, speech instruc-
tor, is faculty sponsor for the re-
vamped art discussion feature.

Pitt ha_s enjoyed its ﬁrst successful pep rally. of‘ the
year. Or has it? Why the ‘large turn“ outifor therally
prior’ to the West Virginia game? We Wouldlike to think
that it was due solely to the team and the cheerleaders and
the Student Congress assemblies committee. But was that
the ‘case? ' ' . ,

SC’s assembly committee went far aﬁeld to get out-
side talent as .a drawing card for the rally. And they suc-

ceeded. The popular quartet which sang at Soldiers and‘

Sailors Memorial drew a larger number of students than had
rallies.
the recording group appeared, to over-

cheer spontaneously for their team, at the rally as on '-the

The introduction of talent to such an assembly could

, be beneﬁcial if‘ that talent“ were part of the student body

and non-professional. In this case, a record turnout such
as was seen at the Mountaineer rally, would not only be jus-
tified but also highly acceptable from a team standpoint.

Post Your Spirit

The annual “Beat Penn State” poster contest is. once
again being sponsored by Student Congress in an effort
todrum up student spirit. . g .

' In years past the emphasis has been placed on frater-
nity andsorority entries, notthrough the fault of the sponsor
but ‘through the disinterest of independent groups.

Greek letter societies, contrary to popular belief, do
not hold a monopoly on school spirit. Nor is it necessary to
be a part of.a large group in order to display either spirit
or posters. At Pitt, as in his own home, the individual is
still ‘uppermost. »

Regression‘ or Progress

By Jim Deweese
They tell us we’re stupid, or relatively so at
any rate. They say that we are inferior to our
ancestors from a standpoint of intelligence. They
say the literature and the science and the myriad
byproductsof. man’s mind shine dully in the bril-
liance of the past. 4

They point to the year 1776 -and the Declaration
of Independence and to 1781 and
the Constitution of these ‘United
States and to innumerable inci-
dents, diffused by the passage
of time and distorted by. “near
sighted” historians standing too
close to events to receive more
than the initial impact before
they lwere knocked sprawling,
blinded by the personal effect
and blinded to the overall scope.
V Historic J Distortion ,
_ They say that never has a mansuch as Hamil-
ton or Franklin or Paine‘ trod the earth. But at
that time, it was said that Newton and Galileo
and Van Gogh represented the peak. And before

that it was Socrates and Aristotle and DaVinci.
And still we progress. We stand upon the foun-
dations built by these great men of the past and
reach higher for achievements beyond the realm
of their comprehension. Two brothers from Ohio

A . look at D'aVinci’s early theories of ﬂightoand: build _

A staff of highly trained engineers study the

ﬂying around half the world. , .
And we look at Newton’s experiments and devise
jet propulsion. Not just one of us but ‘a group
in England, anotherin. Italy, a _group of Germans
and a number of American engineers.
they create a plane capable of ﬂying completely
around the world without landing. And another
which, at its maximum speed of 3000 kmiles an
hour, could span this continentrbefore you could
fall asleep in your history class. ~ ' A
And they say the writers aren’t as good. And
yet we have the Huxleys and the Faulkners and
the Hemingways. They say that man cannot per-
ceive the world in which he lives and we point
to the Wylies and Ganns. V
They cry that the leaders of the past are. dead,
leaving behind only a record of glorious achieve-
.ments, never to be equalled or surpassed. *And we
turn to Churchill and Adenauer, and Hoover.-
Don"l' Lis‘l'en—BuiId! T ' -
They tell us that we are not men of_ vision
and We reply with a world, planned not for today,
but for an unknown future. _And we continue to

build amid the shouts of oblivion which engulf

us. » ..
Still they deplore our gradually decomposing
mentality. iAnd they will continue to do so a
hundred years from now as our descendents span
the solar system, at which Galileo marveled, and
point their path through the universe. '

most of them. In their speeches

The Tuck Shop atmosphere is
very pleasant. The sweet odor of
cigarette smoke chokes me, the

they had previously formed, but
they also ‘ brought many fresh
aspects of the timely questions to

‘ their" minds.

Although audiences at the Car-
rick, Munhall, and Alderdice

high schools gave the appearance

of having a non—caring attitude
at the offset, -they perked up and
showed much spirit and enthu-
‘siasm toward the program.
Warm-Up Time
.Just as successful radio and
television prograrns -are often due
to an inspiring warm—up period,
all three groups proved that this
preliminary sets "audience atti-
tude for intellectual shows as
well. Mr. Newman subtly, but
comically, chided the Dartmouth
men about having a womanless
campus and spoke to the female
portion of the audience of the
men’s joy at seeing so many love-
ly young ladies. At that point
one of the Dartmoutli’s men’s
faces turned a vibrant shade of
red, extracting squeeky giggles
from the females. .
Not to be overlooked wasthe
response the gentlemenly and

Three Hours Later

Well, perhaps. my exit was a
little abrupt, but that push was
just the thing I needed. I went
right through those milling peo-
ple, and, I didn’t,stop until I hit
that great, huge, cold, hard wall.

I’m really afraid to go into
that place any more. Maybe if I
really want a cup of coffee I can
bring my own thermos, or I can
wait until the Tuck Shop sort of
empties out at 4:30.

Better yet, maybe l’ll come to

point, the foursome got along as

The spirit , was exemplified

/when a negative debater stated
that ‘_‘Joe must go.” In the next"
' speech an aﬁirmative man said

Wi.de Opportunities

I Dartmouth’s W a d d e l l and
Krasnow were surprised at the
opportunities Pitt debaters are
given to gain speaking poise by
presenting both objective and
subjective clear cut opinions to a

large group. At Dartmouth’ the .

men speak only to small groups
in classrooms.

Most important of the reasons
for Pitt’s sponsorship of high
school debaters are to givethe

speakers valuable speaking ex-

perience and promoting good
will within the district schools.
Pitt has been sponsorii-.g high

THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT
/   or NED FUTTY  

Chloe McColgate was a beautiful coed who majored in psych and
worked in the I.Q. testing department of the university. She did
not work there because she needed money; she worked there because
she loved and admired intelligence above all things. _“I love and
admire intelligence above all things,”g's the way she succinct1y.put it.

Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take intelli-

ence or leave it alone. What he loved and admired above all things
as girls. “What I love and admire above all things is girls, 18

the way he put it.

One day Ned saw Chloe walking by on the campus. “Holy Toledo!::
he exclaimed. “How sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes!
The following day. he saw her walking past again. “Great balls of

ﬁre!” he exclaimed. “Next, when

I cast mine eyes and see that brave

vibration each Way free, 0, how that glittering taketh me!" _
When he saw her again the next day, he could no longer contain

himself. He ran up and blocked her way. “Excuse me,“ he said,

tugging his forelock, “I am Ned Futty and I love you beyond the

saying of it. Will you be mine?”

She looked at his quarter-inch haircut, his /black rimmed glasses,
his two-‘day beard, his gamy T-shirt, his tattered Jeans, his-d'e-
composing tennis shoes. “You are not unattractive,” she admitted,
“but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is, what I require

in a man.”

“I’m smart as a whip” said Nedwith a modest blush’. “Back home _

everybody always said, ‘You'got to get up pretty early in the morning
to get ahead of old Ned Futty\”’ -

“Maybe so,” said Chloe, “but if you don’t mind, I'd like to make.
sure. Will you come into the I.Q. testing department with me?”

“With you I would go into a malted milk machine,” cried Ned
Futty and laughed and smote his thigh and bit Chloe's nape in an
excess of passion and high spirits. Scampering goatlike, he followed
her into the I.Q. testing department.

“First I will test your vocabulary,” said Chloe.

“Shoot!” said Ned gaily and licked her palm.

“What does juxtaposition mean?”

“Beats me,” he confessed cheerily.

“How about ineffable?” T .

“Never heard of it,” smiled Ned, plunging his face into her clavicle.

“Furtive?” C

“With fur on?” said Ned doubtfully.

Chloe sighed. “Howare you on arithmetic?” she asked.

“A genius,” he assured her. ‘ . ”
. “What’s the difference between a numerator and_a denominator? ‘

“My feeling exactly!” said Ned with an approving nod. “What's
the difference?” ‘

“If a man earns ﬁfty dollars a month,” said Chloe, “and saves 12%
of his earnings, how long would it take him to save $100?”

“Forever,” said Ned. “Who can save anything on $50 a month?”
_ “How do you ﬁnd a square root?” _ _

“How should I know?” replied Ned, giggling. “I’m no square.”

“Wreet,” replied Ned, clutching Chloe to him and dancing 32 bars
of the Maxixe. ,

“Next I will test you for manual dexterity," said Chloe. She handed
him ‘a board punched full of oddly shaped holes and a collection of
oddly shaped pegs. “Fit the pegs in the holes,” she instructed him.

“Let’s neck instead,” suggested Ned. _ I

“Maybe later,” said Chloe. “First the pegs.”

0 He fumbled about for a longish interval. Finally he tired of it and

' reached for Chloe. —

But she fended him off. “Ned Futty,” she said, “you are dumb.
You have the highest dumbness score of anybody I have ever tested.
Consequently I cannot be your girl, for I love and admire intelligence
above‘ all things.”

He hurled himself on 'the‘ﬁoor and clasped her-about the knees.
“But I love you!” he cried in anguish. “Do not send me from you, or
you will make my world a ‘sunless place — full of dim and fearful
shapes!”

“I am sorry,” she answered, “but you are too dumb.”

“Reconsider, madam,“ he begged, “else a miasm looms before me.”

“Go,” she said coldly.

Spent and speechless, he struggled to his feet. With leaden steps
he made his painfulway to the door. There he stopped and lit a
cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to his gray and
grisly future.

“Stay!” called‘ Chloe.

He turned.

“Was that,” she asked, “a Philip Morris you just lit?”

“Yes,” he said. ,

“Then come to me and be my 1ove!” cried Chloe joyously. “For
you are not dumb! You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
Philip Morris with its ﬁne vintage tobaccos, its cool relaxing mild-
ness, its superior taste, its snap-open pack. Ned, lover, give me a

After Buckeye Bashing

By GENE AROMATORIO .

Although Pitt’s Panthers are sure‘ to be home this coni-
ing New Year’s, the teams they have been meeting and one
they will play this Saturday are good bets to be in some of
the nation’s top bowl games this January 1.

Ohio State, the Panther’s most recent conqueror appears
to be a deﬁnite Rose Bowl ‘participant while the other Rose
Bowl eleven has already been picked and is none other than

knocked off the ' Pittites
season opener.

Now this Saturday the Panthers
will ‘be battling the probable
Orange Bowl representative of the
Big Seven-—Nebra_ska. The Corn-
huskers, beaten « ‘  '1
only twice in
s e v e 11 games,
are a good bet‘
for the Miami

the locals could do nothing with

Although the Panthers were 13-
point underdogs for the game,
many observers, feeling the Pitt-
ites would put up a good battle,
thought the odds were way out of
line. However, the Skyscraper U.

doubled the expected margin.

Hamilton summed up the Pan-

For the Panthers the only backs
who couldget anywhere were two

His , Was
Life Battle

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

Intestinal fortitude is usually used to describethe cour-

. ageous action of asoldier and while Dr. Ralph Shanor fought

in the Second World War, his intestinal fortitude appeared

just recently under far different conditions than war.
Hiswas a battle to stay alive in the face of incureable

illness and the likeable football team physician’s ﬁghting

' heart put up a tremendous struggle but it could not hold up

very long. M
The doctor, who helped Panther athletes for 25 years, was given
up as gone more than a month ago but he remained alive, it is said,
because his Pitt team was winning.
The players even presented him with an autographed foot-
ball from the West Virginia win but a few days later he was in
a coma that lasted until his death early Friday morning.

The last time that he was ‘ '- ' I ‘ ' V
with his “boys” was in the past
spring’s drills since he entered
the hospital late in the summer.
Everyone on the squad liked Dr.
Shanor because. he was always
around to help out when aid was
needed.

Many times he would carry
around silver dollars that became
presents for the man who would
intercept a pass or recover a
fumble that was important in a
Panther victory.

And, for his contribution to
Pitt athletics, the Lettermen’s

bowl at the present Homecoming - ’
conclave. Captain Tom Hamilton accepted it for him and later brought
it to the hospital. '
The award was for his long service which was interrupted
only by three years in the armed forces. during World War II.
He had come to the University three years after graduating from
the Pitt medical school in 1926.

His friends in the local college football world were many and
varied as evidenced by his pallbearers, Bill Kern, Dr. Eddie Baker,
Bobby LaRue, Bud Moore, and others. Another companion, Frank
Carver,’ the Pitt graduate ‘manager of athletics, commented that he
“wasn’t“°‘a man you can write a lot about, but he was just a nice

guy and a ‘wonderful person.”

Tourney Fever  Harriers
Following Undefeated Season

, By STEVE BUTCHOCK A
Tournament fever has grasped Coach Carl Olson’s all-

conquering harriers following their 23-35 triumph over Ohio

State Saturday, and the 15-50 shutout win over Ohio

right frame of mind if they are

Swamis All Tie
. wait till next week, and no fairs,‘

Bord,” all of the‘ Yogis clamored

-‘teams and brought his average to

and second consecutive undefeat-
ed season. , ,

Coming on the heels of wins
over such notables as Army, Man-
hatten, Villanova‘, and Penn State’,
the Olsonmen will probably be
ranked as one of the favorites to
capture the IC4A crown after
defeating the highly-touted Buck-
eyes. _

‘Arnie Sowell took individual
honors against the Buckeyes in
pacing his teammates to the
crucial win in one of the Blue and
Gold’s most bitterly fought en-
gagements of the season.

The Ohio Wesleyan meet found
the Panther thinclads dishing out
the “blanket” treatment for the
fourth ti-me this season. Captain
Alan Gunderson ﬁnished ﬁrst
followed by Arnie Sowell, Thorton
Smith, Jack" Schubert, and Bob
Cherry.

Now that the regular season is
over and the IC4A’s quickly ap-
proaching,,_,Coach Olson will at-
tempt to get his thinclads in good
condition, both physically and
mentally, for he knows that next
to being in top physical condition,
the runners must also be in the

to make a good showing.

In the IC4A’s and the upcoming
NCAA’s next week, the Olsonmen
will face the class of the collegiate
world in long distance running
and should they attempt to rest
on their laurels, defeat would be
almost ‘ inevitable.

In effect, the Panthers have a
man-sized job to perform if they
hope to take the title that slipped
away by a scant two—point margin
last year to Michigan State, the
closest that the locals have come
since 1924 when they won the
crown.

Pre-medical Fraternity
Completes Info. Books

A new booklet outlining the

qualiﬁcations for admission to
medical school has been completed
by the Pitt chapter of Alpha
Epsilon Delta, national pre-med
society, and will be distributed to
every pre-med student who regi-
sters at the university.

Entitled “The Pre-medical Stu-
dent,” the booklet features sec-
tions devoted to qualiﬁcations for
pre-med studies, college work,
and the medical school itself.

Also discussed in detail are the

allied ﬁelds of hospital adminis-
tration, physical therapy, public
health work and laboratory and
x-ray technology.

The human side of the medical
school is taken up in a section
devoted to the personal qualiﬁca-
tions necessary to becoming a
physician.

Dr. W. C. Kelly, associate pro-‘
fessor of physics and sponsor of
the pre-med honory, and Dr.
Benjamin Haseltine, head of the
modern language department and
adviser to pre-professional school
students, worked with under-
graduate members of Alpha Ep-
silon Delta who authored the text.

Dr. Haseltine explained that the
students themselves recognized
the need for a booklet answering
the many questions a new pre-
med students ask.
