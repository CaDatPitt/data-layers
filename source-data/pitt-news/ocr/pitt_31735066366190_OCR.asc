Ask About Greek Life on Campus

Leaders Discuss
Benefits of Being
Greek Affiliated

By FRED FRANK
Some 20 students, mostly
freshmen, made up the audi-

CV ence of the Student Union

Board forum,’ “To Greek or ‘-

Not To Greek,” held Monday
afternoon in the Student
Union ballroom.

The panel blandly discuss-
ed‘ the advantages of the
Greek system on the campus
and explained how the fra-

ternities and sororities oper- '

ate. From its panel is was obvi-
ous, the forum was not set up as
a debate on the merits of fra-

4 -p.-/ternities.

' ed by

President of the Interfraterni-
ty Council (IFC) Ed Miguelulcci
and Shirley Boatman, president
of Pan Hellenic Council, repre-
sented Greeks. Mark Senick, pres-
ident of Men’s Council (MC), and
Doris Turkes, president of Asso-
ciated Women Students (AWS),
spoke for student organizations.

Most of the questions present-
moderator John Vrana
were aimed at comparing the

‘life of the Greek and that of the

independent at the University.
Miguelucci pointed out that be-
sides weekly parties, the Greek
has contact with his brothers or
sisters Within‘ the organization.

Senick then explained that the"

non-Greek could use Student
Union Board activities or civic
events such as the Pittsburgh
Symphonyconcerts as social out-
lets. 4

lWhen the subject of fraternity
housjng was raised, the -IFC pres-
iden said “the housing is not

new, but "there-‘is more to a fra-i

ternity house than just the ﬂoor
and walls that make it up.” He
noted that a "fraternity row had
been proposed but that it would
not be built for ‘at least ﬁive to
seven years.

audience, Miguelucci was press-

 at Thursday Concert
Excels with Chopin’s Works

, If last Thursday’s P.M. series program was any indica-
tion of what the Student Union Board has planned for this
season, then it looks like we’ll have a year of ﬁrst-class en-
tertainment. Dolores Holtz demonstrated that she ranks

gﬁas one of the top dozen pianists in the country.»

The ‘young and attractive Miss
Holtz opened the program a tri-
ﬁe weekly, dropping a note or
two in Wolfgang Mozart’s Sona-
ta in E Flat Major. Actually, only
the ﬁrst movement of 'the_ piece
was "suited to Miss Holtzfspecial
ability to ﬁll her playing with
warm emotion. The second and
third movements were, as are
most of Mozart's work, technical-
ly excellent. Though Miss Holtz

fully, not even she could make

The most triumphant part of
the ﬁrst half of the program was
her interpretation of Felix Menl
delssohn’s Variations Serieuses.
After a few rather banal lines,
the pieces livened up and soon
the room rang with melodic lines.
Then the excitement diminished
and_ the lines became delicately
emotional, ﬁnally ending grace-'
fully in an allergo tempo.

piece, perhaps a little too bizarre

for some tastes, gave the young"
pianist a chance to show her skill

MDC Passes New Rules

For Tower Dor

By NANCY FUCHS

Graduate women and sen-
ior assistants may’ now serve
as chaperones for Towers
house parties under a new
set of social regulations es-
tablished by members of
Men’s Dorm Council (MDC).

The new rules which MDC
President Harvey Lefton termed
“a bit more liberal” are effec-
tive immediately on a trial basis.

The ﬁve rules represent part
of a proposal, drawn up by MDC
late last .winter. They were ﬁ-
nalized after recent MDC Cabinet
and Executive Board discussions

‘with Chancellor of Student Af-'

fairs Helen Pool Rush and Dean
of Men Herbert McGibboney.
The ﬁrst rule which permits
more ﬂexibility in chaperones re-
quires that three counselors and
two graduate women or senior

assistants chaperone‘ house par-"

ties. The job of chaperone is no
longer limited to married cou-
ples or people over 21 years of
age.

The second rule allows one
couple to be in a room during
open houses and house parties.
The old rule required that two
couples remain in a room. Each
couple ‘ must regster with" the
house or ﬂoor counselor before
going into the room.

Men entertaining guests in
their rooms must keep their doors
completely open," according to
rule three.

The understanding that “be.
havior at these functions should
reﬂec-t good taste and that stu-

dents’ actions should be beyond

reproach” is the essence of the
fourth rule. 4
The ﬁfth rule states that any

 

HARVEY LEFTON ,
Guides MDC Action

infraction of the regulations may
result in “immediate disciplinary ,
action .against ‘ the student in-,

-volved and the entire house.”

Lefton added that the whole dorm,’
will not suffer from one student’s _ ,

misbehavior.

Additional rules or changes in
the present, ones may be made

by MDC after a committee is es-
tablished to re-evaluate past pro-
grams, according to .Lefton. ‘.‘I

don’t want to propose any other_)‘

changes until I see that it has

the backing of the men,” he said. ~

Since Lefton felt that the men_}
should have the beneﬁt of- the i
new rules which he termed ‘i“a 
step in, the right direction,’-* he"

made them effective immediate-

ly. “However, I want to keep the ‘— 1»
door open for MDC to’ draw up 

more improvements,” he explain

ed. The ﬁrst MDC meeting  af,_«

week from today.

Students Suffer

Dorm Temperatures Soar 
As Air Conditioning Fails

The Towers air conditioning system failed for the first"

time in" two years this weekend, raising the temperatures»?

in the dorms to the high 80’s. The failure, which occurred’

-sometime Saturday, was not noticed until ‘‘late Saturday

night” according to David W. Ginevan, assistant director

of men’s housing.

The failure was due to'a mal-
function in the electrical con-
trols of the system. At its worst,
the system was working at only
40 per cent -of capacity.

Repair work was not started
until Sunday morning. Some im-
provement was made, but Sun-
day night ‘was the worst when
the men opened their windows
letting in the 90° air. A

The engineers did not have
the system working at capacity
again until 3530 p.m. Monday af-
ternoon,‘ then‘ temperature began
to fall in the Towers. However,
Ginevan pointed out that the
open windows made it impossi-
ble ‘for temperatures to return
to normal because outside tem-
peratures continued to be high.

Ginevan further emphasized

   

grees back to the closed position,’

rather than just moving them
backthe slight amount that they
were opened. If this is not done,
the metal frames of the window‘
will not properly engage" the rub-
ber seals, and a serious leakage
will result. .

.  Phi Eps, Sams, 

Phi Epsilon Pi and Sigma
Alpha Mu were both inter-
fraternity “A” softball
league winners Monday af-
ternoon at'Schenley oval.

Phi Ep beat Delta Sig 11
to 8 and Sammy beat Pi Lam,
22 to 11, as both teams now head
for third round competition.

Phi Ep, sparked by the clutch
hitting of pint-sized centerﬁeld-
er George Prussen grabbed a 5 to
0 lead in the ﬁrst and stopped a
late Delta Sig rally that fell three
runs short in the seventh. Ed.
Eisemen also had two big hits
for the winners. Phi Ep pitcher
Dick Hurwitz went the route for
the victory.

Sammy ran up another big
score in trouncing Pi Lam by
22 to 11. Friday the Sammies
clobbered Sigma Chi 12 to 2. This
victory featured the same star-
ring cast as the earlier contest,
with Stan Smokler turning in his
second seven inning performance,
and John Ungar belting his third
home 1111!. Jim Meyerson, How-
an] Levine and Dan Lichten-
stein also shared the hitting hon-
ors as Sammy broke the game
open in the fourth after Pi Lamb
had knotted the score 5 to 5.

In other IF action, Delta Tau
Delta edged Sigma Chi in nine
innings, 9 to 8. Jim Dockey pitch-
ed the whole way for the Delts.
The winning run scored in the
last of the ninth when second-
baseman Jim Maternia doubled
and scooted home as the Sig Chi
shortstop was booting Grant
Stuart’s grass-cutter.

Gary Martin had two hits and
Ron Schinding, Dockey and Stuart
all had homers for the victors.

Last year, Phi Ep was the
league champion after runner-up
Pi Lamb made the series longer

PHI EPSILON’S double play combination of shortstop Bill Sivitz

and second-baseman Marv Schaffer team up to force an unidentiﬁed
Delt runner in action last Monday at Schenley Oval. Phi Ep won

the game, 11-8.

games. Sammy, who last year
didn’t fair too well, appears load-
ed, and ready to crush .all op-
ponents. This sets the stage for
next Monday's schedule, when
Phi Ep meets Sammy. Regard-
less of the outcome, both teams
will still be in the running be-
cause the season is based on dou-
ble elimination. The league,
which extends through Oct. 13,
has become quite popular with
non-fraternity members too. A
spectator said, “the games not
only show fraternal enthusiasm,
but display a great spirit for
Pitt as a whole.’’

The present standings feature
Sammies in ﬁrst place with a 2
and 0 record. Phi Ep is also un-
defeated in one game with Delta
Sig. Pi Lamb and Delta Tau Del-
ta are each 1-1.

Sophomores Need Improvement

Panthers Settle Down
N ow with Pressure Off

The Panthers might, not
have picked up that hoped
for momentum in their sea-
son opener, but they have
been relieved of a great deal
of pressure.

The 17-15 loss last Saturday to
Oregon proved ‘to the gridders
that they could hold their own
against one of the most experi-
enced teams in the country.
Sophomores Tom Mitrakos, Chip
Rife and Dave Drake picked up
the best kind of ‘experience by
making mistakes. At least in the
following’. nine games they’ll
know what not to do.

“If they’re good ball players
they’ll be able to improve their
game now that the pressure of
the ﬁrst big game is off,” said
head coach John Michelosen.

should be ready by the
time Oklahoma arrives here Sat-
urday. Jones’ 260 pounds ac-
counts for quite a bit of the of-
fensive line beef. Guzinksy was
impressive on defense against the
Ducks.

A major share of this week’s
practice will be spent on defense.
In the third quarter Saturday,
Oregon marched 159 yards al-
most at will in the opening ten
minutes.

The defensive ends, Ed Assid
and Phil Dahar, had trouble box-
ing in the Oregon end sweeps,
forcing the defensive halfbacks
to come up and meet the plays.
This left the ﬁeld wide open to
Tom Trovato’s passes.

When asked about the game,
defensive coach Carl DePasqua
said, “Talk to 1‘/Iichelosen.”
