Insurance P] a n
Non-Competitive

Professor Sees Little Effect
Upon Companies Of New
Government Program

‘Left’ Leads Opposition

VVill the President’s insurance pro-
gram interfere with the insurance
companies of the countiy? ,

According to Dr. Francis  TYSON»
professor of economics _and insuraiice
expert, the program will have little
or no” effect. _

‘‘The government’s pro_gram _will
not be in competition with private
companies,” Dr. Tyson said. Commer-
cial insurance has never covered the
unemployment risk, and the £§0V€I‘11'
ment’s old age insurance will affect the
type of people in the lower income
groups, which these companies have
not been able to reach.” a

The professor explained that people
with little income do not buy old
age insurance, while insurance com-
panies cannot aﬁord to sell uneniploy-
ment insurance.

“The only likely point of Conflict
with insurance compaiiiesiiiay be the
voluntary annuity provision, he as-
serted. "This provision will enable
those of moderate means to purchase
old age annuities at cost from the
government.” ,

‘flnsurance companies may ODDOSG
this-portion of the bill.”

The voluntary annuities will take
care“ of the “white-collared” class of
workers, farmers and small business
men, those not affected by the com-
pulsory unemploymentand old age
insurance,  Tyson said.

The old age planin brief required
each indutrial worker and employer
to pay taxes of one-half per cent of
his payroll. At the age of 65 the
worker is retired with a monthly_ al-
lowance, scaled according to contribu-
tions.

 

 

 

“The voluntary annuity plan was, a v_
wise political insertion on President ‘

Roosevelt's part,” Dr. Tyson declared."
“It makes the entire program coin-
plete in scope and thus ends criticism
that it will beneﬁt only industrial
workers.” . . ,

Opposition to the insurance plan
already has come frométhe “left,” he
said. “The progressives feel the gov-
ernment, has not gone far enough and
are demanding more liberal aid. The
right wing of course has been satis-
ﬁed."

State laws for unemployment insur-
ance are to be stimulated through a
federal tax on payrolls, amounting to
3 per cent, Dr. Tyson explained. Nine-
ty per cent of this tax may be offset
by contributions to state unemploy-
ment reserves.

Business Up 15 Per Cent
Since 1934, Index Shows

A preliminary review of business

activity in the, Pittsburgh district,
prepared by the Bureau of Business
Research, indicates that the general
index has increased about 15 per cent
between January 13, 1934, and Jan-
uary 12, 1935.
. The preliminary ﬁgure has risen
from 52.4 to 60.0. A slight decline
took place in the second week of Jan-
uary, as compared with the _ﬁrst, the
index dropping from 60.9, which it
attained on January 5. However,
the ﬁgure is higher than that of De-
cember 29, 1934, at which time the
level was 58.9.

The items in general which have
been combined to furnish the index
include: production of iron and steel,
electric power, coal, rail shipments
and trade. The trade index shows a
rise over last year at the similar
period, of about 13 per cent, increas-
ing from 61.8 to 69.7 on January 5 of
this year. Every other item showed
corresponding increases for activity
during the second week in January.

Inauguration Brings Trusteeship
To PennsylzJania’s New Governor

 _, 

George H. Earle

‘ Earle of

A few minutes past noon last Tues-
day, when George H. Earle of Phila.
delphia became Governor George H.
Pennsylvania, he likewise
became a member of the Board of
Trustees of the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Official confirmation was to reach
Governor Earle today from Dr. S. B.
Linhart, secretary of the University.

The office .of Governor of Pennsyl-
vania, Dr. Linhart explained, carries
with it automatic membership in the
University Board. Other officers who
become members without having been
specifically elected are the Chancellor
of the University and the, Mayorpof
the City of Pittsburgh.

Former-Governor Gifford E. Pinchot
held the trustecship in double trust
for several years, having been an
elected member of the Board since
his first administration in Pennsyl-
vania. .

At the last meeting of the Board
Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, pastor of
the Shadyside Presbyterian church,
and Roy C. McKenna. president oof
the Westmoreland County Pitt’ club,
were elected to membership.

Psychology Head Questions Validity
Of Testimony  Hauptmann Trial

Dr. Root Believes Witnesses
May Unconsciously Testify
Falsely In Such Cases

 

Is the testimony ofwitnesses in the

Hauptmann case, the “Crime of the

century” trial, valid and creditable?
Dr. W. T. Root, head of the psychol-

iog"y department, is almost convinced
by newspaper accounts of proceedings

intlie trial that Richard Bruno Haupt-
mann is guilty of the kidnapping and
murder of the infant son of Charles
A.‘ Lindbergh, yet he questions the
validity of the testimony identifying
Hauptmann so conclusively in so many

-instances.

There seems to be a psychosis fa-
voring the conviction of the defendant
in such trials, Dr. Root believes, and
witnesses have been known under sini-
ilar circumstances to give false tes-
timony unconsciously and in good
faith. ,

“It is signiﬁcant,” he declared, “that
at the beginning of the trial it was
very difﬁcult to ﬁnd any witnesses;
today, on the other hand, witnesses
are abundant and quite positive in
their identiﬁcations.”

For the defense to submit a plea
of insanity at this date would be
rather foolish, believes the professor.

“Though I cannot make any pos-
itive statement as to I-I.a.uptmann’s
mental status, since I have never
spoken to the man, I can see no evi-
dences of any mental pathology from
newspaper accounts of his behavior.
His actions since his arrest seem to
be perfectly normal.”

He observed that the discovery of
the marked ransom money on Haupt-
mann property was rather incriminat-
ing, and he pooh poohed suggestions
that it might have been planted there
by police.

The fact that all evidence in the:

case is merely circumstantial does not
injiire the brief of the prosecution,
since most such cases depend entirely
upon such evidence for conviction. In
this _trial, the evidence sems to be
convincing, he concluded.

Graduate Student Pens Magazine
Article On Treatment Of Cancer

 

A contribution to the background of
knowledge necessary for the treat.
ment of cancer is presented in an ar-
ticle in the January-February issue of
The American Naturalist by Dr.
Pressley L. Crummy, graduate student.
who recently received the degree of
PhD from the department of zoology.

Dr. Crummy’s article, “The inhibi-
tion of regeneration by x-rays, in the
Urodele, Triturus viridescens,”
points out various biological effects
of x-rays, a knowledge of which is
necessary for further progress in the
application of x-radiation to the treat-
ment of cancer.

The general practice in experi-1
ments to inhibit the i'egciieration of?
tissue by x-rays, according to Din;
Crummy, has been to irradiate the en—§
tire animal, but in his study only the}
desired portion of the body of the}
newts was exposed. Reducing the
length of the exposure to ﬁve minutes. 
he found that he could give a dosage!
sufficient to inhibit regeneration of;

the tails with 446 Roentgen units,
The fact that inhibition of regener-
ation is brought directly by irradia-
tion was shown by Dr. Crunimy in an
experiment conducted by amputating
the tails of a control group and an ex-
perimental group of newts «after
these had once been amputated and
regenerated.
plete inhibition of the regenerating
tails took place in the experimental

completely restored in the control
group.

Completing the work are photo-
graphs showing the complete inhibi-
tion of the regeneration of the tall
295 days after exposure to x-rays, the
abnormal growth subsequent to an ex
bosure to x-rays made 60 days after
amputation, and the abnormal growth

subsequent to a ﬁve-minute exposure,
on the same day that the tail was am-E

putated. All these dosages were of
the same strength, 93.75 Roentgen
units per minute.

To A Welcome New

‘Dr. Charles S. Tip-petts, dean of the
School of Business Adniinistratioii,
will assume ofﬁce February ,1.

In anticipation of Dr. Tippetts’ ar-
rival frcin Buffalo, Montfort Jones,
acting dean, ha.s planned a general
assembly for all students in the School
of Business Administration, at which
the -new_ dean will be introduced. ..

The assembly, according to Mr.
Jones, W111 be held some time after
the beginning of the second semester,
so that Dr. Tippetts will ﬁrst have
time to get acquainted with the stu-_
dents and the faculty. It. is expected

that a free fourth hour will be giVel1 '

to all Business ,Admiuistrat_ion stu-
dents so that they may attend the
meeting.

Other plans arranged to acquaint
the dean with the University faculty,
students, alumni and organizations in-
clude a snicker to be sponsored by
the Pitt Business Institute, business
administration student organization,
in honor of the new dean, and a “get
acquainted” meeting" to be held in his
honor by the Business Administration
Alumni association. No deﬁnite dates
have been set for these affairs. - -

Dr. Tippetts, who ﬁlls a place
vacant for some years since the resig-
nation of Louis K.» Manley; is forty-
one years oldand a graduate of
Princeton, from which he holds a
PhD degree.- After teaching several
years at Princeton, he went to the
University .01’ Iowa. He also taught
at the University of Washington, Se-
attle. For six years he has been pro-
fessor of economics at the University
of Buffalo, where he was elected the
most popular faculty man on the cani-
pus this year.

Pre-Dental Bod y
Seeks Recognition

Organizations Committee Will
Consider Application Today

The constitution of a new organiza-
tion, the Pre-Dental Society of the

University, will be considered by the ‘

Organization Committee of SFA to-
day.

According to oificers, the purposes
of the new organization are to bring
about a closer relationship between
the members of the faculty and pre-
dental students; to give the students
an idea of professional conduct; to
correlate the ﬁelds of dentistry; and

to acquaint the student with the
problems facing the profession.
_ The first meeting of the society,

held recently, drafted and accepted
the constitution. Ernest Rose was
elected to the presidency of the new
organization. Other ofﬁcers chosen
were James Lace, vice president, and
John Braillier, secretary-treasurer. A
faculty advisory board of Drs. '1‘. F.
McBride, chairman, Charles B. Wal-
ton, A. S. Lawson, R. P. Rose, and J.
F. M‘cParland, all teachers in the
school, governs the policies of the
new organization.

The upper third of the pre-dental
freshmen who have completed one
semester are eligible for membership
in March. They are elected by a two-
tliirds vote of the membership. An-
other third is eligible for member-
ship in September. The present niem-
bership is 23.

Protestant, Jewish Leaders Speak
Of ‘ ‘ Common Heritage ’ ’ Before
Forum In YMHA Friday

Agreeing that the accord between
Christians and Jews is older than the
discord, D1‘, Bernard C. Clausen of
the First Baptist church, and Rabbi
Solomon Freehof of the Rodef Shalom
temple presented Protestant and
Jewish viewpoints in the Good-will re-
ligious forum at the YMHA Friday.

Both speakers emphasized the need
the two
lfaitlis and the necessity of being
more than tolerant. Dr. Claiisen, the
first speaker, pointed out that “our
3.(lIllll‘atlO’3.‘l for a general trait may
have no correlation with our habits
of behavior,” and that “understand-
ing between the two faiths should be
encouraged.”

“eFurtherinore,"' he, continued, “there
is no use fooling around with those
people who won't understand.” Dr.
Clausen’s opinion, “VVe are most in-
sensitive to points of sensitiveness” in
members of opposite faiths, and gave

as examples the usual type of passion

play, the teaching of Shakespeare’s
Merchant of Venice in secondary
schools. Good F'riday, in the past,

Dr. Clausen believes has been a source
of conflict due to the old -belief that
the Jews were responsible for the
death of Jesus. “The Christian of
today should approach Good Friday
in a spirit of humility and self-
blame,” he ﬁnished.

Rabbi Freehof uniﬁed his discussion
around the idea that Christians and
Jews today are the common target for
an attack by dictatorships sponsoring
atheism and paganism as evinced by
the Russian and German govern-

‘ nients.

‘he said “doesn't make much differ-
I

“The doctrinal difference today,”
ence at all. The discord_ between
Jews and -Christians, is a heritage
from the days of darkness, Both are
heirs of the same past.”

Rabbi Freehof characterized. the
conventional teaching of the death of
Jesus as a. “murder story.”

Adding a statement to the rabbi’s
remark that there must be a "'reteach-

ing,” Dr. Clausen maintained that
the “retea.cliing” must be “in new
ways.”

Rabbi Freehof, commenting on athe-
ism, in Russia said: “The picture of
a German Jew has been substituted
for a Palestinian Jew. In a few years
some communist will discover some-
ing about communism in the Bible,
and then God will become the great
comrade.”

MethodOf Award

Proposed Senior Plaquelieplaces
Former University Prize

Methods of choosing the winner of
the proposed Senior award will occupy
ODK members at their meeting to-
morrow evening. According to George
Roll, Ed35. president of the i1ien’s all-
activities honorary, acceptance by the
University of the annual prize is al-
most assured.

Suggested to take the place of the
former University award, the new
prize will be given to the senior out-
standing iii both scholarship and ac-
tivities. It has been planned to in-
scribe his name on the bronze plaque
in or near the Cathedral.

An objective point scale system for
choosiiig new members will also be
discussed. Roll said. “Although our
requi1'ements are fairly deﬁnite,” he
asserted, “we have no uniform basis
for selecting all new members. We
shall try to put our mininia into a
graduated scale.”

Individual members, it is said, will
recommend stepping up the scholar-
ship requirement for membership
from 1.0 qualily points to some high-
er ﬁgure. Although Roll, who ex-
pressed ignorance of the proposed
move, declined to comment, it is an-
ticipated that the plan will ﬁnd sup-

Speaks Today

Holgar Johnson

LUMNUS AND ODK, who returns
to campus to address the Pitt
Business Institute on insurance.

Holgar Johnson
To Address PBI

Alumnus Will Discuss “Economic
Aspects Of Life Insurance”

“Life insurance institiitions through-
out the United States have paid out
about six billion dollars to the pub-
lie in the- last three years,” says Hol-
gar Johnson, C22, who will speak
here at 3 o’clock today at a meeting
of the Pitt Business Institute in Room
200, Alumni ball. “This sum, three
times more than the amount the Re-
construction Finance Corporation is
using to carry on its work, Will SW8
some idea of the extent to which life
insurance affects the general public.”

“Economic aspects of life insur-
ance” is the subject on which Dr.
Johnson will address the afternoon
discussion meeting of the business
administration student organization.
He. suggests that all students who
have questions to ask about insur-
ance keep them in mind and present
them at the time allotted for dis-
cussion after his talk. _ '

Ml‘. Johnson was prominent in
campus activities during his under-
graduate years here. He was a mem-
ber of ODK, chairman -of the Junior
and Senior Proms, a member of SAE
social fraternity and later a‘ member
of the Alumni board of SAE.

Mr. Johnson is the ﬁrst of a group
of prominent business men of_ the
district who will speak before
the students on current business
practices. According to Harry C.
Hacliineister, BA37, prograin chair-
man, the Pitt Business Institute hopes
to secure as future speakers: Robert
Garland, president of the City Coun-
cil; Frank H. Phillips, president of
the Philadelphia company; Dr. James
H. Greene, chairman of the Retail
M,ei°chaiits association; Marie A. Ma-
loney, personnel director at Kauf-
mann’s department store; Dr, David
R. Craig, director of Research Bureau
of Retail Training; and Mr. Walter
Fraser, president of M'cCanns.

Joseph Scliewe, president of the
Business Administration Alumni as-
sociation and of the Pittsburgh Ad-
vertising club, will represent the at-
unini at the meeting today.

This session will be the last meet-
ing of the Pitt Business Institute open
to all students in the School of Busi-
ness Administration.

SFA Constitutions

Body To Suggest
By-Law Changes

Proportional Representation Of
Women In Governing
Organization Sought

SeparateVoting Decried

Tomorrow SFA’s Executive
committee will consider a propos-
ed prc-examination holiday and
an extensive report submitted by
the Constitution committee.

Upon approval of a resolution
favoring the holida,\', the iuat-tor
would be forwarded to Dr. John G.
Bowman, Chancellor of the Univer-
sity, who would then submit the pro-
position to the Executive committee
of the Board of Trustees.

Extensive revision of the by-laws of
SFA will be advocted by the Constitu-
tion committee, headed by Helen Mill-
iron, C35. According to the program
of the body. four major changes in
procedure are recommended.

Proportional representation of we-
men in both the Assembly and the
Executive committee will be suggest-
ed. Undergraduate registration of
men students is now 2,348, the report
will say; that of women is 1,210. With
the p-resent structure of the Univer-
sity Assembly, it is pointed out,
only four out of 30 student members
are women.

To remedy the disproportion, it is
asked tliat ten women and 20 men be
elected each year. Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women, and Hazel
Lincoln, C35, president of WSGA, fa-
vor fuller women's representation,
the committee will claim.

Advocate Election Change

Under the plan to be proposed, at
least 30 juniors and 30 seniors shall
stand for election beginning this year.
“Each voter,” the committee will say,
“sh-all ballot for ﬁve seniors and ﬁve
juniors. The ten senior men, the ﬁve
senior women, the ten junior men, and
the ﬁve'junior women receiving the
liigliest ‘vote shall be declared elect-
ed.” »

Although a minority report of the
body suggests separate elections of
men and women candidates, the group
asserts that such a plan “might defeat
the purpose from which the SEA was
designed.” It is stated in the report
that the SFA was formed to insure
“full and equal rights and privileges
for all students.”

Coiisommt with the
change in the Assembly personnel is
a proposal to admit two women and
four men students into an executive
committee of nine members. There
are eight at present.» ,

The six undergraduates wouldbe
elected in a separate voting system.

Inasmuch as the SFA by-laws are
silent on the subject,~ilie‘* committee
recommends that at least one-half
the_ineinbei'ship of the Assembly con-
stitute a quorum. ,

There will also be a section advis-
ing electioii of a parliamentarian,
who would decide questions of parlia-
mentary procedure a.t meetings.

Provide For Vacancies

dismissa.l of Assembly members would
be filled within 30 days through the
selection by the Executive committee,
of that candidate who, at the preced-
ing general election, received the next
highest vote after the last "duly elected
man-studeiit member or woman-stu-
dent member of the Assembly.”

According to the report, vacancies
in the Executive committee should be
ﬁlled by inetliods similar to regular
election procedure.

_ Members of the reporting organi-
zation are: Miss Milliron, Miss Lin-
coln, Colonel E. J’. Cullen, George
Roll, Ed35; Frank Reich, C36; and

John Tibby, C35.

 

By Herbert Rackoff

Technological advance can never
eliminate the “right to work,” accord-
ing to Dr. Ralph E. Flanders, eco-
nomist and national president of
ASME, for so long as the world needs
variet_v, the vast mechanical factories

of which we hear will “never be
more than a dream.”
“Stuart Chase, famous American

economist, claims that machines will
replace men almost entirely in indus-
try," Dr. Flanders said, “but I can’t
see this happening until the world be-
comes completely standardized.”

Production will exceed consumption
only until our distributive system is
able to cope with industry. After this
adjustment, the standard of living
will be more likely than overproduc-
tion, the economist believes.

Enlarging upon his economic and
political beliefs, Dr_ Flanders in an
address before the University branch
of the ASME here Tliursd.'i.V listed
the ﬁve points which a desirable so-
ciety should have.

“A desirable society,” he pointed
out, “should provide a gradiiallv ris-
ing standard of living and an environ-
ment which will insure an equality
of o,nport.unity. though not necessariliv
of income or education. It should as-
sure simple subsistence through work

for those who can, and relief

salaries in proportion to the service
rendered. It should promote the
highest degree._of corporate and in-.
dustrial progress in ways consistent
with the other provisions.”

An important hindrance to the ris-
ing standard of living is the concep-
tion that engineering has reached the
end of its progress and that no fur-
ther advancement is possible. Ac-
cording to Dr. Flanders, this belief is
embodied in the campaign for a 320-
hour week, which assumes either that
our production has risen 60 per cent
from 1929. or that our standard of
living must be lowered.

Speculation, he continued, is a
form of business in which an individ-
ual merely acquires wealth which is
alre/a.dy produced, and therefore adds
nothing to society. For that reason.
Dr. Flanders believes it should be
curbed so far as possible, while those
enterprises which do produce should
be given the greatest amount of free-
dom.

Discussing the way an engineer can
render the best service to society. the
president suggested that he strive to-
ward a complete unity of his profes-
sion.

Reuben Slesinger,

The Galileo Telescope
E MARK with full agreement
the declaration of Harvard
President James Bryant Conant
last week that if the intellectual
stagnation threatening Germany

under its present systcnr of re-

striction on discussion, and even
on thought, is not to spread to
other countries, the spirit of free
inquiry among scholars must be
carried on unliampered.

Said President Conant:

“The universities and col-
leges as focal points for spec-
ulation and research are the
subject of hostile criticism
and in at least one country
have suffered a devastating
persecution.

“Man’s restless spirit of in-
quiry has always been dis-
concerting to those who de-
mand a ﬁnal and unchanging
picture of the universe. The
Paduan professors whose
orthodoxy did not allow them
to look through Galileo’s tele-
scope havc had many follow-
ers.”

Today the telescopes are being
dismantled. Not only in Germany,
but wherever the dogmatic packs
are in cry, the historical and so-
ciological instruments which have
given us a grasp on the stars are
being buried underground.

Men revert ten thousand years,
and run to hide their heads be-
cause the earth is shaking.

In Germany, the “natural”
sciences of chemistry and physics
are being expanded tumultuously
to ﬁnd substitute war materials-—
and thus to obviate biology—
while the “social” sciences sur-

render to the art of the primitive,

tribal medicine man.

VVhcrever anything like the
National-Socialist and Fascist
movements has come to power,
the universities have been the
ﬁrst outposts of attack. And they
have fallen without much strug-
gle. Indeed, the scholar and the
u 11 dc r g ra dua t e student hold
among the most vulnerable of
positions. Not economically in-
dependent, the scholar in Ger-
many and elsewhere has had to
cloak his reason or inufﬂ-e his
voice, or be liquidated, when the
Rosenbergs and Goebbels roar in
the pines. Neither economically
independent nor -certain of eco-

President Conant raises the
question for America:
“Are we to have a civiliza-
tion which draws its non-ma-
terial sustenance from dogma

or from free inquiry?

“The connection between
intellectual freedom within
the academic wa.lls and lib-
erty without is obvious. Sub-
stitute dogma for free in-
quiry and open discussion
ceases. The spirit of inquiry
is too deep—rooted in a demo-
cratic land to be banished by
the magic wand. It could be
cxtcrminatcd only by a stern
and ruthless persecution.
Abandon our faith in the dis-
passionate search for the
truth, and by a series of def-
inite steps we shall ﬁnd our-
selves living in a spiritual
prison with an organized mob
for our jailors.”

It is remarkable, the number of
good ideas that the student “govern-
ing” group is getting these days.
Really it is. There was that perfect-
ly swell idea of appointing a commit-
tee to make up some traditions for
the University, an idea, strangely
enough, that never seems_to have oc-
curred to Student Councils of other
years. And now there are hanging in
the balance at least two questions of
the utmost importance, the deciding
of which may change University life
entirely. The weight of these meas-
ures cannot be estimated. They are
the sort of problems that young men
grow old over, the sort that old men
‘laugh at.

Neither of these questions has any-
thing to do with street car fares. One
of them concerns moving pictures;
whether or not it wou1d’t be a lovely
thing to hire a hall and show news-
reels, charging ﬁve cents a head——to
cover costs, I suppose. It has not
been stated that SFA would appoint a‘
committee to censor these movies.
Certainly there should be such a

Clark Ponders On Fate Of Numerous

Another question of moment is that
of deciding what to do about declar-
ing a holiday before examinations so
that the children will have a chance
to" "relax and get their minds in order
for the trials. This idea very likely
had its origin in the minds of some
simple soul who thinks that students
are pressed for time to study, and
that if they had a day’s vacation they
would use it to study. The night
clubs are watching with bated breath
for the decision on this count; it will
mean much to them. The movement
is too conservative; it does not go
far enough. SFA should work for a

Editor, The Pitt News:
This is "possibly a good time for the

tent that is inspired by hard times
seemsto have produced a ready mar-
ket for their virulent olterings as does
a slushy street give vent to wet
shoes.

The visibility is clear enough for us
to discern that the downtrend of
values and prices is the inspiration
for sporadic revolutionary ideas. These
instigators of chaos are doggedly try-
ing to strike while the victim is down.
However, when good times return the
slump will appear for all the bearded
Utopians.

But they wliimper that for the re-

In the past, when we revelled in pros-
periiy, they shouted “good times can-
not last.” At present it seems a phys-
iological action on an empty stomach
produces a receptive ear.

The home, the church, the unity of
the family and the rigidity of true
government need rise up and defend
their idealism against the clamoring
of unruly, biased insurgents.

, Capitalism seems to be the
main target for the change-ails.
Their inability to compare in an
economical fashion those ele-
ments of use and rarities of abuse
seemingly inherent in modern
institutions are the stamp of
their inability to discriminate.
VVe may say that the characteristics
of our modern era are the rapidly in-
creasing commodities and services en-

hanced by an individual gain of
wealth, Production has grown to
such a state allowing in some in-

stances for the multiple addition to
net goods and services of the consum-
er. _ Can any one say that our stand-
ard of living has not risen? The la-
borer in the steel mill enjoys comforts
of life that were reserved to the resi-
dents of Park avenue only a short
time ago. Sharing on the part of all
has been the result of multiplying the
ouanfity of output. Who can doubt
the genuineness of our common will
to share and share alike? In a na-
tion as ours we see not misery remain-
ing asa permanent St__f.I.g‘!lEttiOll, butan
incessant urge for a. loftier, continued
prosperity.

Some radicals relegate the cause of
the depression to our theories of coin-
petition. That competition has some
unsavory aspects cannot be doubted
for in combats, whether physical or
mental, a victor will emerge over a

turn of good times means a drastic:
radical change in our mode of living. 4

decency are striking in comparison
with the clawing octopus of radical
‘thinking.

The mainpoint about capitalism is
that any superﬂuous regulation on
production does not hinder the em-
bodiment of the system. The early
abuses of the initial employeres of our
realm have been modiﬁed non-exisb
ence. _ V

The establishment of living
minimum wage, the valiant effort
to perpetuate safety of the labor-
ing class, and. various forms of so-
cial insurance instituted in the
apparent effort to sustain a rea-
sonable code of fair dealing give
to capitalism its deserved posi-
tion i-n the realm of human en.
deavor. Rigorous laws have es-
tablished a code of fair competi-
tion, monopolistic powers have
been sheared of needed backing
and the consumer has benefited
through governmental standards
of goods. While much may be
said of positive legislation for the
future, it cannot be denied that
the potentialities of capitalism
have been strengthened by the

past acts of comparable social
Iegislations.
The weighty problems of today

more than emphasize the new realm
of social responsibility. If the business
man today can consider man as a
commodity, he must of a certainty
give that individual treatment as good
as that accorded his machinery. The
broadmincled adherents of capitalism
have accepted the policy of the recip-
rocal action of high wages, with the
realization that the sale of products
depend on the intensity of consump-
t.ion which is connected with a high
level of living. Efficiency and pro-
ductivity have been vaunted by the
reliance of employers to. the basic
principle of association. Personal inan-
agement of enterprises ha.s reduced
the old practices of hiring and ﬁring.
Individual leisure has been derived
from the noteworthy efforts of capi-
talism in its combat with uniformity
and monotony of labor.

Vvhile there may be in the future
incessant attacks upon the realm of
capitalism, the record compiled by its
adherents will mark the most trium-
phant social advance made in the his-
tory of economic life.

Panthers Still Hold Spell

Over Notre

Dame   Outﬁt

 

Skip Hughes Leads Cats To 26-22 Victory;
Peters, O’Kane Star For Losers

 

By Charles A. Ruch
Mr. John D. Lawther, coach of the fast-stepping Vilestniinster bas-
ketball outﬁt, is probably just a little more worried today as he goes
about preparing his Titans for their game with Pitt Wednesclay.
Mr. Lawther was one of those who sat in on the ball game Saturday
night when the Panthers downed the Irish of Notre Dame by a 26-22

count.

For although the Golden (until they¢

take their sweat suits off) Cats were
not quite up to snuff throughout the
game, they did show enough to con-
vince Mr. Lawther and a few thou-
sand other people that perhaps some-
body has been kidding about the de-
plorable state of basketball affairs at
Pitt this season. It is likely that the
Irish thought so, too.

The lid must have been on the has-
ket for the Cats, especially during the
first half, as time after time the ball
would sail right up to the opening in
the hoop and then change its mind
and direction to slip off somewhere
else. After two minutes of this,
O’Kane, Irish forward, got a chance
to try out their basket and it was
very receptive to his classy shot from
the side, the Notre
ahead at 2-0. Shortly after that Claire
Cribbs stood far out on the sideline
and arched one that was meant to go
in from the very start. It did, and
the Panthers were on theirway.

Skip Hughes counted a foul shot
to put the Cats in the lead and then
Emrick slipped in another one from
the side and Roderick made good on
a foul shot to make it 6-2. After that,
Ford shifted into high gear and drove
down the ﬂoor for two field goals to
tie things up at 6-6. All this had con-
sumed no less than 15 minutes, the
remander of the ti-me being spent
largely in watching Pitt shots bounce
harmlessly off the rim.

Shots Begin To Go In

I-Vith only ﬁve minutes to go, Em-
rick got a. ﬁeld goal, Roderick came
through on one of two foul shots, and
Skip Hughes added another two-
pointer to bring the Pitt total 11p to
11. Jordan ma.de a foul shotto help
out the Irish cause and then Marty
Peters ended the scoring for the half
with a nice shot from off to the side,
making the scoreboard tread 11-9 as
both teams went in to hear what the
coaches had to say.

Coach George Keogan must have
said quite a bit to the husky center,
Peters. Peters hadn’t made a "point
until the last minute of the ﬁrst half,
but he got two ﬁeld goals and a foul
in the ﬁrst_ four minutes after the
intermission to put Notre Dame
ahead. Hughes inserted a basket dur-
ing Peters’ scoring spree but the
Irish were now ahead, 14-13. Jor-
dan’s foul made it a two—point lead
for Notre Dame and O’Kane balanced
Roderick’s foul shot with one of his
own to keep the lead the same.

Here big Pete Noon came through
with his only basket of the evening,

- but it was the one Pitt needed to get

going again. With the score now tied
at 16-16, Hughes put the Panthers

' ahead with a ﬁeld goal and Wainio,

who had entered the game for R0
derick, twice wound up out around
mid-ﬂoor and sent the ball right
through the netting. Between
Wainio’s tosses, however, a Notre
Dame sub named Hopkins got one for
the Irish to put the score at 22-18, all
told. Hughes got a ﬁeld goal and
O'Kane countered with a similar
counter for the South Benders.
Cribbs Ends Pitt Scoring

Cribbs slipped in the ﬁnal two
scores forthe Panthers with but two
minutes to go. In the last seconds of
play that man Hopkins pushed one
from out i11 mid—ﬁoor and it went
through without a murmur. The Pan-
thers took care of the ball after that,
passing it around among themselves
until the timer’s gun called a halt.

The victory was Pitt’s ninth over
the Irish cagers in 14 starts and the
third one in a row for the Carlson-
men over the South Benders.

Skip Hughes was high-point man
for the Panthers with four ﬁeld goals
and a foul while Peters’ three two-
pointers and a foul took up the most
room in the scoring books for the
Irish.

Freshmen Trounce Kiski

from all angles, the Pitt freshmen
outclassed the Kiski quintet from

Syracuse Mittmen Down
Pitt Ringmen In Opener

 

The ‘Eastern intercollegiate boxing
champions up at Syracuse had 3, lit.
tle too much packed away in their
gloves for the Panther boxing team
last Saturday night when the two
teams met at Syracuse, New York.
The Orange boxers pounded out a 6175
to 11,é victory over Coach Schricker’s
inexperienced squad.

Abe Konick substituted for Captain
Jimmie Giannatti, who was on the
sick list, in the 135-pound event.

The Pitts started out well enough
when Sivak drew with Black in the
115-pound match, but when their
weights got heavier the Orangemen
got tougher, as the summary shows
only one Pitt victory and that in the
145-pound class in which Spiegel was
capable of out-pointing an Orangeman
and as result won his bout on a de-
C1Sl0Il.

The summary:

115-pound class —— Black (S.) drew
with Sivak (P.).

125-pound class—Solomon (S.) de-
feated Paslowski (P.) on decision.

135-pound c1ass—Bardacke (S.) de-
feated Konick (P.) on decision.

145-pound class——Spiegel (P.) de-
feated Button (S.) on decision.

155—pound class —— McGiven (S.)
knocked out Goldberg (P.) 1 minute
of second round.

165-pound class ~— Captain Balish
(:S.) defeated Gongloff (P.) on deci-
sion.

175-pound class—Jefferis (SA de-
feated Stoughton of (P.) on Decision.

Trackmen Engage
In Practice Meet

Runners Show Mid-Season Form
In Friday’s Tryout Events

There will have to be some re-paint-
ing done on that huge sign upon which

the track house records are inscribed
if the Panther trackmen continue to

day’s trial runs.

Arvil Fleming and S01 Menaker,‘

dash men, both served notice that the
existing record of 5.5 seconds for the
50-yard dash held currently by
Schlossburg, is due to be erased from
the boards. In one trial heat, Men-
aker nosed out Fleming by inches,
and at the same time tied the track
house mark; in the other two heats
Fleming took ﬁrst honors, covering the
50 yards in 5.4 seconds and 5.5 sec-
onds, respectively. McMunn .ﬁnished
third in all three heats.

Cy Pelucha and Will Johnson waged
an interesting duel in the pole vault
event with Cy topping the bar at 12
feet, 6 inches to edge out Johnson,
who cleared 12 feet even- Pelucha
made this mark without removing his
sweat shirt, causing one observer to
remark that the roof’ on the track
house will have to be raised to allow
more room for these aerial per-
formers. -

In the mile run Kirkpatrick came
within three seconds of breaking that
record, doing the -12-lap course in
four minutes, 36.5 seconds. His team-
mate, Vvagenhouser, ﬁnished a stride
or two behind him to take second
honors. Bill Albright placed third.

Another dog ﬁght battle was waged
in the quarter-mile event with Fred
Ki-ger edging .out- Bud.Groat for the
ﬁrst time this season. Kiger’s time
for the 440 was 53.9 seconds.

Good took ﬁrst honors in the 50--
yard high hurdles, followed by Blair
and Sowiski. In the half-mile Leggin
was clocked at two minutes, 7.5 sec-
onds to win that event. _:

The only other event on the pro-
gram found Bonavita heaving the 16-
pound shot some 44 feet, 6 ‘inches to
capture that event from avizienis and
Gongloff. »,

"D e v e I o p Crack Marksman
On University Range
Inside Stadium

By William F. McClellan

Inside the main entrance of the
stadium there is a gray frame build-
ing bearing a black sign with gold
letters, “Riﬂe Range, Cadet Corps
University of Pittsburgh."

Only a small percentage of Pitt stu-
dents have ever been inside or know
anything about this dull gray-colored
building. It is the University Rilie
range where records have been made
and broken, where good marksmen
have been made. out of the most inex-
perienced gunners, and where Pitt an-
nually turns out championship riﬂe
teams that compete with the foremost
marksmen of the country. A ,

In 1931 the ﬁrst part of the range,
now ranking among the best in the
country, was completely equipped
with lights, ﬁring points, and butts.
A room used as an office was added in
1932 and the range now includes
everything a marksman could wish
for—excepting a device which would
guide shots to the bull’s eye. 

The present riﬂe range is a far cry
from the one the University used for
seven years previous to the comple-
tion of the present range. .It was in
the basement of the 176th Field A-r-
tillery Armory. Facilities were
abominable; however, they were the
best available at the time. This site
might just as well have been used by
the Navy, for it was full of__ water
most of the time and the riflers had
to stand on boards and sacks. Per-
haps ﬂoating targets were the vogue,
but nevertheless it’s a pretty safe
wager that the gunners were glad to
move their quarters to the range in
the stadium.

In conjunction with the federal gov-
ernment the University has equipped
the present range with the best avail-
able facilities, some of which are 22
Springﬁeld riﬂes of .22 calibre, ﬁve of
which are the latest type, 20 shooting

Phi Delta Theta Remains Undefeated
In Interfraternity B o w Ii 11 g League

 

Phi Delta Theta continued its unde-
feated pace in League “A” while the
Pi Kappa Alpha League “B” leaders
lost ground in Thursday’s double-head-
er this past week.

Competition on Thursday, double-

header night at the Centre-Neville al
leys, gave Pi K A an even split. The
pace-setting pinmen were ﬁrst upset by
the Delts, 2-1. However, in its next
match against the runner-up -SAE
bowlers, Pi Kappa Alpha regained its
temporarily lost lead by sweeping all
three games.

In another important match, Phi
Kappa nosed out Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon, 2-1. Sigma ‘Chi forfeited three to
Sigma Alpha Mu, and likewise to Del-
ta Tau Delta. Sigma Alpha lVlu also
forfeited a trio of games to Phi Kap-
pa, to bring the count up to three
matches defaulted, three played.

In their second match with the
leading Pi K A rollers, the Delts tied
the recent Phi Ep ﬁve-man team rec-
ord of 752 pins. Davis with 198. and
Baker with 171, led in this record-
tying game.

League “A” contests on Wednes-
day were again featured by the high-
rolling Phi Delta Theta leaders. Two
games in the seven hundreds and one

V in the six hundreds insured a clean-

c11t victory over the Phi Gams. Glass-
ford’s 182 carried off high-scoring hon-
ors for the evening.

In other League “A” ﬁghts, Lambda
Chi stayed in the running by whip-
ping Pi Lambda Phi three straight.
Lambda ‘Chi Alpha’s determined drive
in the late stages of play has been the
"surprise’.’ of-tourney play to date_ Phi

‘Epsilon Pi forfeited-.to Theta Chi in

the ﬁnal match.
Tomorrow nights, -Phi Delta Theta

Jneets this threatening Lambda Chi

-combine in the crucial match of
League “A" competition. Theta Chi
opposes Pi Lambda in the other

match.

Milton Margolis, Phi Epsilon Pi, has
been appointed to La Rue’s vacated
position of co-chairman of I_nt.erfra-
ternity Athletics by the Presidents

Rifles With A

jackets, a Bausch-Lomb spotting
scope,‘ Palma-Match and Remington
Clean-Bore ammunition, and official
National Riﬂe Association targets.
These targets are the ﬁve bull's-eye
type with the center ring ﬁve hund-
redths of an inch in dia.meter.

During the ﬁrst year of shooting at
the present range the highest team
score, 1,420 points, was made. Charles
Zoller, ‘Col. ’34, turned in the best in.-
dividual record from the standing po-
sition on the new site with a score of
96, In the inter-collegiate postal match
with Stanford, New York Stock Ex-

-change, Hawaii, Vvest Virginia, and
‘University of California in February,

1932, the Pitt riﬂers made a perfect
score shooting in the prone position.
The team average for that week was
224 points.

Last year 25 teams were met by the
Pitt marksmen in postal matches, out
of which Pitt won 13 engagements. In
shoulder-to-shoulder matches Pitt de-
feated the Swiss Riﬁe Club of “Wilkins-
bug and Tech. At the national inter-

 

Council. George Golanty, Sigma

‘Alpha Mu, continueswas the other co- 

chairman.

ship tourney as soon as possible.

Football Banquet Planned
, For Lincoln's Bir th day

Plans for the annual Pitt football
banquet are rapidly taking form under
the direction of James Hagan, gradu-
ate manager of athletics. The affair
will be held at Vvebster Hall, on Lin-
co1n’s Birthday, Tuesday, February 12.

Hagan is now dickering with sev-
eral prospective speech-makers and
promises at least one and perhaps two
cracker-jack talkers for the banquet.

Assisting Chairman Hagan with
plans for the event are Norman Mc-
Cloud, John McCready, Endicott
Batchelder, Ira Hill, ‘W. W. Zig, W. T.
Corbett, John W. Hallock, Bert Gaw,
and Charles Ruch..

Tentative arrangements call for the
banquet hall to be transformed into a
miniature stadium, complete in every
detail. Those attending the banquet
will eat and sit in the “stands.”

The price of the tickets is two dol-

 

lars.

Titan Stars Are
Cats’ Next Worry

High-Scoring Bennett To Lead
Westminster Quintet Here

The Stadium pavilion, surviving the
pounding it took Saturday night when
Notre Dame played here, will again
be the feature spot of the city when
Coach John Lawther and his troupe
of undefeated VVestminster basketball
players, featuring the district's lead-

ing scorer in Wes Bennett, trot out
there Wednesday in an attempt to
chalk up Dr. Carlson’s Panthers as
Victim No. 10 on the Titan records.

Always rating as one of the dis-
trict’s strongest cage teams, the Ti-
tans this season have proved to be
no exception, to that fact. To date,
all that the Titans have done to earn
a part of the country's basketball
spotlight has been to present a team
that has waded through nine oppo-
nents without defeat, a team that has
averaged over a point a minute for
the nine games, and the district's out-
standing scorer in ‘Wes Bennett. Lis-
ted among Westminister’s victories
are wins over some of the best teams
in the country including City College
of New York and Geneva. One of the
standout performances by the tower-
ing Titans was the 73-23 whipping
handed to Salem last week.

Lawther, who in his time at West-

minster has regularly put out strong
cage teams, was fortunate in having
most of his last year's varsity return
this season. Bennett, Sweeney, VVil-
helm and Hunneke are all last year
varsity men who form the bulwark of
the ﬁrst string this season. Of the
ﬁve starting players only Backus, at
the center position, is a new man.
Good reserves are also present on the
Vvestminster squad, giving good rea-
sons enough for the success of the
Titans.
_ \Ves,Bennett, at either the forward
position or center, is another good
reason. Wes, who was leading district
scorer in the district last year, again
has a strangle hold on the lead, to
date averaging well over 15 points a.
game. Bennett is a clever ﬂoorman
and can toss that ball through the
hoop from almost any angle on the
court.

University’s First Coeds
Reminisce Over WUP Days

Fe ttermans Shatter Age,
Family Records Here
In 40- Year Period

By Sarah Harris

Coeds come and coeds go, but few
have the distinction of being the first
coeds ever to enroll at a university.
To Mrs. John C. Fetterman and her
sister, Miss Stella Stein, belongs the
distinction of being the ﬁrst coeds ad-
mitted at Pitt.

In 1895, Margaret and Stella Stein
approached Dr. Wi1liam.J. Holland,
Chancellcr,’and applied for admission.

“The fact.” Mrs. Fetterman admitted,

“that there were two of us, and that
we were sisters, probably caused Dr.
Holland to favor our admission. I
don’t believe one girl would have been
considered, as her application would
not have been taken seriously.” After
the board of trustees had approved
the Stein sisters’ entrance to what
was then the Vvestern University of
Pennsylvania, the ﬁrst coeds startled
the doubting class of twenty-eight
men by annexing ﬁrst honors in the
graduating class of 1898.

In the 1890’s there were so few
students as compared to the present
enrollment that the .chancellor’s of-
ﬁce was used as a sort of coat room,
the sisters coming in every morning
to hang up their coats and hats and
returning every evening to put them
on again. Every thing that Stella and
Margaret Stein did was hailed as
“the ﬁrst time women ever did that
at WUP.” The sisters entered into
every activity they could and took
important parts in the one hundred
and tenth anniversary celebration of
thecollege in 1898. Both won and
shared the honors of the graduating
class and -both gave comiiiencemeiit
speeches at Carnegie Music hall. That
year, incidentally, was the ﬁrst that
caps and gowns were used for the
graduating class. Barbara Fetterman,
Margaret Stein’s daughter, wore her
mother’s cap and gown for her grad-
uation, and wore her sister’s hood
when she received her master’s de-
gree in retail training.

Both women received their MA de-
grees in 1901.

Not only was-Margaret Stein the
youngest coed ever to graduate from
the University, but she belongs to
the. ﬁrst family to ,graduat,e,,from
Pitt. It was as a student that‘ she
ﬁrst met John C. Fetterman, who
graduated from the Universitjy in
1896, Dr. Fetterman contributed more
than twenty-ﬁve years of service to
the University, spent in part as head
of the department of biology and
dean of the -College from 1910 to
1922.

.'The three Fettermaiis followed
their pare-n_ts’ footsteps, in attending
Pitt, and now the Fetterman family
of ﬁve,‘ after spending a total of
about forty years at the University,
can boast the possession of nine de-
grees conferred upon it by the Uni-
versity. George, theyoungest student
ever graduated from the School of
Medicine, received his doctor’s de-

gree at the age of twenty-one; and

later.rec.eived an »MA from the Uni-
versity of Toronto. At present he is
connected’-with‘ the Mayview City

hospital. Like her mother, Barbara
Fetterriicin graduated from the Uni-
versity at nineteen and, receiving her
niaster’s degree ‘a year later. is the
yoiiiigest student ever graduated from
the Research Bureau of Retail Train-
ing. Immediately after graduation,
Miss Fetterman became a selling-cost
specialist at a downtown store; some
months latershe became a buyer,
and then, last October, she became a
training supervisor in merchandise
and fashion training at Kaufmann’s.

 

Hauptmann Case

Takes Back Seat
For Mock Trial

 

While the Hauptinann trial rages in"

Flemington, the School of Business of

Administration today plans its own_

“Trial of the Century."

Room 301 -in Alumni hall has been
secured. Plaintiff and defense attor-
neys have been “hired.” Battle lines
have been drawn. And today a bustle
of activity ﬁlls State hall as four
classes discuss the fate of the great
mock trial.

, Vvednesday at 7:30 o’clock there will
be enacted the Carlson vs. Brian dani-
age case. One class will furnish the
defense witnesses, another plaintiff
iviitiiesses, the third court ofﬁcers and
all four will contribute to ﬁll the jury
box.-

Miles H. Jones, assistant professor
of business law, will be judge. Wilson
Slick, BA38, manager of an insurance
company branch in Johnstown, is the
plaintiff attorney. Reuben Slesinger,
BA36, last year’s plaque honor stu-
dent, is defense attorney.

The facts of the suit are as follow:

Charles Carlson was driving a
Model T Ford far to the right along
Buck Tail trail at ﬁfteen miles an
hour. Fifty feet behind him drove
Lawrence Brian in a Buick coupe.

M,cA1lister road was hidden from
view by dense slirubbcry and trees.
Bifian speeded up and attempted to
pass Carlson just‘ as Carlson swung
to the left to make a turn into Mc-
Allister road.

’-No bones were broken but Carlson
entered suit against Brian for dain-
ages to his antique. Brian in turn
claimed damages to his car.

The result is the trial now to be
heard by twelve University jurors,
good and true. Said jurors will not
be chosen until a few minutes before
the trial.

Vifilliam H. Markus, instructor in
business law, is sponsoring the event.

Women’s Average
On Point Scale
Higher This Year

83.7 Per Cent Of Undergraduate
Women Listed In Activities,
Dean’s Report Shows

Eighty-three and seven-tenths per
cent of the women of uiidergraduate
age and interest in the University who
are carrying a minimum of twelve
credits are in some manner connected
with a campus activity. This list iii-
cludes appointments; any constant
membership in organizations, per-
manent coininittees, clubs, fraternities
and any group relationship of the
student outside of classes.

The percentage this year is unusual-
ly high, according to Miss‘ Helen P.
Rush, assistant dean of women, who

is compiling the information. Last
year, at the end of the second seni-
ester, there were 77.8 per cent of the
women entered in activities. Becaiise
membersliip in activities increases to-
ward the end of the year, due to
spring rushing and spring festival
week, this pei‘centa.ge is higher in
comparison than present ﬁgures iii-
dicate.

All of the women on the list ai'e
not enrolled in point evaluated work.
The point scale system is devised to
determine officially what students
shall be eligible to hold ofﬁce in ex-
tra-curricular activities and to regu-
late the number of such offices an in-
dividual may carry at any one time.

This scale of points changes as the
responsibilities connected with the
ofﬁces change from year to year or
froiii semester to semester. Every type
of responsibility is evaluated, commit-
tee menibership usually being rated as
one or two points.

Any student who is participating in
evaluated activities may apply at
Heinz House to ﬁnd the number of
points being carried and to determine
whether she must resign from any
organization. Women who are “over-
pointed” are being checked.-

The total number of points wliicli
may be carried periiiaiiently has been
set at ten. Those carrying over this
number must either resign from some
activity, or petition to Miss" Rush for
excess points.
