Cindy Skrzycki knows what
makes a good slice of Swiss cheese.

Large‘ holes render the cheese
ﬂimsy and ill—suited for ‘a sandwich,

. while Swiss cheese without uniform-

ly sized holes makes a slice visually
unappealing. v
She has also said that there are, 22
possible classifications for Swiss
cheese, based on the size of holes and
the overall character of the cheese.
Skrzycki is a connoisseur — of
federal regulations. ‘
Skrzycki, a journalist—in—resi—
derice in Pitt’s English department,
writes a weekly column on Swiss
cheese and a host of other issues for
The Washington Post; , '
She spoke to a small audience in

O . the Cathedral of Learning on Tuesday

night about what she described as “a
‘governmental function that’s been
around in one form or another since

' the beginning of the Republic.”

Her anecdote about Swiss cheese
represents what she called a more
“entertaining” example of federal
regulation and was one that she
included in her recent book, “The
Regulators:- Anonymous Power
Brokers in American Politics.”

“I opened the book with it
because I wanted students to under-

stand that nothing is off-limits,” she

said. A .

A common link between airports,
pollution, — cars, and yes, Swiss
cheese, is the federal government’s
unique brand of bureaucratic rule-
making.

The Macedonian Ambassador to the United States, Nikola Dimitrov, visited 
on Wednesday afternoon to discuss Macedonia’s position on Balkan affairs.

The Graduate School of ‘ Public

O and International Affairs, in partner-
ship with

the University for
International f Studies’ Center for
Russian and East‘ European Studies, _
has opened a center in Skopje,
Macedonia, that will offer a Pitt
Executive masters degree to students _
studying in the school.

To . celebrate this development,
Nikola Dimitrov, ambassador of the
Republic of Macedonia to the United
States, delivered a lecture on
Wednesday in ZK56 Wesley W..-
Posvar ‘Hall ‘concerning Macedonia’s

‘position on foreign affairs in the

Balkans. - _

His visit to Pitt comes during a
series of about 13 stops at universities
around the U.S. _

Carolyn Ban, dean of the GSPIA,

Ambas sador vi sits Pitt

said‘, “I’m particularly happy to wel-
come the ambassador because I think
his visit continues the very strong
relationship that this university has
with the Balkans and particularly with
Macedonia.” 1 V
Macedonia is bordered on the
north by Serbia and to the east by
Bulgaria, and has Greece to the south
and Albania to the west. ~.
According to Dimitrov, the cen-
turies-long reign of two: empires pre-
vented the normal ‘process of the
building of nation—states to occur in
the Balkans as it ‘happened in the rest
of Europe in the nineteenth century.
Dimitrov said that Macedonia is
now participating in a condensed
process» of the building of a nation-
state and a democracy, and taking part
in the process of integration, all at the
same time. - '

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

A Pitt graduate from the early
1980s stopped into the Student Affairs
office last December looking for a
former adviser, whom he first encoun-
tered in his freshman year. .'

’ Coming back to Pittsburgh for a
wedding, the graduate stopped in the
William Pitt Union to say hello to
Joyce Giangarlo, whom he hasn’t seen
in almost 20 years. '

During the. years, Giangarlo,~

adviser of Student Government Board
as well as for the College of General
Studies SGB, has been someone to
whom students can go, not only with a
problem or for advice, but also just to
talk. _ '

A South Hills native, Giangarlo
has been a faculty member at Pitt
since December 1979. _‘

Since then, she has undertaken the

role of being an adviser to various

organizations
affairs.‘

“For me, a whole lot of these stu-
dents are a huge part of my life,”
Giangarlo said. “Some of my students

throughout . student

_, still keep in contact with me that grad-

uated lO or 15 years ago.”

Currently, Giangarlo is also the
adviser of Phi Eta Sigma and Omicron
Delta Kappa, along with ' managing
Student Events, Telefact and Pitt TV.

“[The students and I] have had
some really great moments,” she said.

“There have ,been some tough chal- .

lenges, but we’ve builtfso many great
things here [at Pitt].’f7 

When asked what was the best
part of working at Pitt, Giangarlo
replied with a hearty laugh, “That’s
easy. The students, the students, the
students”,

On the other hand, Giangarlo said
her biggest challenge has been “get-
ting people to trust students more, in
regards to their decision making"

Pitt researchers add to the  

fight against Alzheimer’s

DAVEEN RAE KURUTZ
Staff Writer I

Diane Balcom is not just an
advocate for research
Alzheimer’s disease, she has also
dealt with the disease in her person-
al life. _

As the regional director for the
Alzheimer’s Association, she works
with the disease and its effects on
families every day.

For 12 years, from 1982 until
19194, her family coped with’ the

debilitating disease as it ravaged

her"mother"s mind. V
“The worst thing about the early
stages was that you _don’t know
what it is,-but the pers-on knows,”
Balcom said. - 
_Balcom watched her_mother
withdraw from social situations,
dropping out .of\--the c‘hoir”a‘ndjher
card club, because of the anxiety
and fear she felt as she came to

terms with the disease. At first, her '

mother’s actions left‘ the family
confused, Balcom said, explaining
that they wanted to believe the
change_was a result of old age. ‘
But as confusing as the change
was for Balcom and her family, she
pointed out that it was very fright-
ening for her mother, too. i .
University _ ~ of Pittsburgh
Medical Center researchers‘ Dr.
Chester Mathis and Dr. William
Klunk may be able to chaI_1g.e—;.th.e

‘ ‘uncertainty and. fear of Alzheimer’s

in_the future. In January, Mathis
and Klunk went public with ‘their-

, study of a new protein dye,
Pittsburgh Compound B, that may _

forge theway fora new world of

- A_lzheirner’s disease} res_e_arch--and

imaging.»   

Alzheimer’s disease . _affects
more than 4 million people in the
United‘ States, including, one of
every/10 people over the age of 65,
and nearly 50 percent of people
over the age of 85.

In the next 50 years, it could
afﬂict as many /as 14‘ million more
Americans. -«"'Alzlie"i’rner"s affects
memory and" cognitive function,
primarily-_in people aged 65 and
older,‘ ‘often causing dementia.

The most popular theory con-

cerning Alzheimer-’s disease sug-

gests that it is caused by growthin
the brain of amyloid plaques, which
researchers believe kill brain cells.

Amyloid plaques originate as

r amyloid -precursor‘ proteins — pro-

teins that are found in the brain and
have no apparent bodily function.

\

- OII.

When these proteins are processed
abnormally, they produce a byprod-
uct called beta—amyloid, which
materializes into amyloid plaques.
There is currently no way to detect
the change in the brain and attempt
to preemptively treat Alzheimer’s
before it becomes debilitating. ‘
‘Pittsburgh Compound B sticks
to the amyloid plaques in the brain
and allows for their detection
before death. Previously, the only
method of identifying these plaques
was in an autopsy. .
According to Mathis’ and
Klunk’s study, the new protein dye
is only retained in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease. Doctors inject
it into patients’ brains, along with a
radionuclide, chemical, and they
then observe the brain using tech-
nology called a Positron Emission
Tomography scan. _
_ During this non—invasive proce-
dure, the dye ‘stains the amyloid
plaques, and the chemical releases
positrons, which give off a signal
that the scanning machine -is able to
pick up. -  -
The project began eight’ years
ago, when Klunk contacted Mathis,
wanting to work on a collaborative
research project concerning amy-
loid imaging. 1 I _
He had done various studies on
the topic and was unsure where. to
go next, and he contacted Mathis

because he had a background in 

radiopharm-aceuticals. '
The project has three goals,
Mathis said. i
“Someday, we hope to develop a
diagnostic agent for physicians and

patients,” 'Mathis said, adding that

the UPMC has already licensed the
necessary technology from
,Amersham Health, a British imag-
ing company.

Mathis’ explained that he hopes
the project will also help evaluate
drugs aimed at stopping the amy-
loid plaque, and thus the progres-

. sion of Alzheimer’s.

Through*’the project, he also
hopes to test the hypothesis that
plaque build—up causes Alzheimer’s
disease.

Balcom, the regional director of
the Alzheimer’s Association, said
her organization is pleased with the
development of
Compound B. '

“Thisis a major step forward in
pharmaceuticals,” she said, refe-r-
ring to thepopportunities in preven-

.tive medicine that thecompound

may create.

“Change, growth, understanding
and other people are what all student
leaders need to consider when making
decisions that affect the entire Pitt
community,” she said.
“It’s what we do to get through the
process,” Giangarlo said‘ with a smile.
Advising SGB is a continual,
year—round task, and with each year,
new student opportunities are offered.
This is how Telefact, the student
directory, shuttle buses and Safe Rider

—‘ formally. known as X,/and Call "— "'

came about. » _ ' 0 » .

According to Giangarlo, SGB" has
the power to inﬂuence the’ student
body as decision makers.

“[SG_B’s] power to allocate the
funds is the lifeblood of the organiza-
tion,” she said. ‘ —

0 During her time at Pitt, Giangarlo
has watched the University change
and grow from the student develop-
ment to the physical changes that have
occurred on Pitt’s campus.

SGB has helped change Pitt’s
physical campus with everything from
the bus shelters to the bronze panther
to the neon sculpture in the Union
atrium.

“These are things that students
don’t know about, yet alumni don’t
forget,” Giangarlo said. “I think Pitt’s
an amazing place to be.”

One student was so thankful of the
time and work in student life put in by
Giangarlo and Stephen Sivulich, a for-
mer Pitt professor, he donated an
award on their behalf. This annual
award goes to both a student and a
mentor who have demonstrated exten-
sive leadership and mentoring quali-
ties.

A committee of student affairs
professionals from various colleges

‘ and universities who will carefully

review each applicant selects the win-
ners.

A student and a professor will be
chosen to win, and each will receive a
$500 cash award.

The award will be presented in
time for the upcoming spring break.

The deadline for all applications is
Monday, Feb. 23.

Last year’s winners were student
Jill Costigan of the CGS SGB, and
academic adviser Sara Brennan of
CGS. »

, All application information is
posted online at
www.mentoraward.com.

“I was so shocked when [I was
told] about the award last year”

Giangarlo said. “It was the sweetest
thing.”

Although the award was donated
anonymously, there are many other
students that seem to feel the same
about the impact Giangarlo has made
on them.

“She definitely kept me sane.
She’s very good at that,” former SGB
member Jesse Horstmann said. “With
students working together, feelings
get in the way, and she kept us all
calmed down.” ‘

Macedonia wants to join NATO

Macedonia, page 1

Macedonia declared its independence
in 1991. The government calls itself
the Republic of Macedonia, but,
because of an unresolved dispute with
Greece, it was admitted into the
United Nations under the name of
Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. This subject still remains
an issue.

The country has had turmoil in
recent years; during the Kosovo crisis,
Macedonia took in 360,000 refugees.
And in 2001, a group of ethnic
Albanians attacked the country.

Since then, after a year of stabi-

%OFF

lization, Dimitrov said that
Macedonia’s primary goal in its
development is admittance into the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the European Union.

“It is our belief that Europe can-
not speak to others if it cannot speak
to itself first,” he said.

Dimitrov said there is usually an
aggressive and negative connotation
to the Balkans in the United States,
but he looks forward to a change in
the future. ‘

He added, “I hope very soon that
the region’s development will be rec-
ognized, and you will see the Balkans
as you see the rest of the world.”

Regulators’ jobs include listening to Howard Stern, drinking tea

Skrzycki, page 1

Regulators, after no shortage of
deliberations, set guidelines for holes
in Grade A Swiss cheese at three-

eighths to three-sixteenths of an inch.

Regulators were recently in the

news V with the . Federal
Communications Commission’s
investigation of singer Janet

J ackson’s revealing Super Bowl half-

time performance.

Skrzycki discussed the FCC’s
application of obscenity standards,
including its ban of “seven objection-

' able words.” , ..

According to her, one man at th
FCC spends a considerable amount of
time listening to tapes of Howard
Stern’s popular morning radio show.‘

Politically, regulation is often an
instinctual response to crisis. In the
wake "of corporate scandals such as
the collapse of Enron, Skrzycki noted
that many called for more vigilant
regulation and stronger laws to be
used by regulators.

And there are cases of less g1am- -

orous regulation, which tend to elude
the political radar screen. One man,
whom Skrzycki met, had the job of
tea—taster, a task that consisted solely
of tasting teas and classifying them as
green, oolong or pekoe.

The man, an" employee of the fed-
eral government for more than 50
years, favored the “taste and spit”
method. 1 ,

For Skrzycki, knowing her beat
means research, albeit research that is
not as specialized as that of the tea-
taster.

Cindy Skrzycki

“Every week is like a term

that really needs to be researched

thoroughly before you can approach
it.”

In the fall semester, Skrzycki’

plans to teach an Honors College
course on the history of journalism.

Teaching shouldn’t be much of a
stretch for Skrzycki, who spends
much of her time in an informative
role, writing about a cadre of bureau-
crats with whom most readers have
little familiarity. It’s a role that clear-
ly fascinates her.

“These people run the govern-

“They aren’t elected. They make a

Zoos should call the creatures by name

Meet Aloysius the Alligator. Say
hello to LaToya the Llama. Esther
the Elephant is pleased to make your
acquaintance.

These phrases haven’t been
uttered at the Pittsburgh Zoo since
1990, when zoo director Barbara
Baker decided that theganimals there
would no-longer be referred to by
names.

Her reason? _

She wanted to preserve their
“wild mystique,” she said in a state-
ment issued Tuesday. The thinking
behind the gesture was sound, even
respectful of the animals as wild
creatures and not human playthings.
But the zoo is reconsidering its deci-
sion, and rightly so. The zoo is
accepting public comment on the
matter and will make a final decision
next month. _

Most zoos feature names for their
animals. The Pittsburgh Zoo has the
only baby African elephant at any
zoo on the continent, and she’s only
referred to as “V” —— not exactly the
most publicity-grabbing moniker.
Pittsburgh should be bragging about
her, but without a name, it’s harder to
do that. The National Aviary, also in

Pittsburgh, brings in visitors with ,

Stanley, the baby penguin.

The notion of preserving a wild
mystique is a thorny one. The ani-
mals are creatures of the earth, but,

whatever spin we put on. it, referring
to “habitats” and open areas, they are
still locked up in cages. Not exactly
wild. y

So, in that context, not naming
the animals does them a disservice,
and only serves to highlight the
unnaturalness of their situation. It’s a
human instinct to name things. we
name our pets, our cars and our gui-
tars. If we want to share our environ-
ment with animals, it makes sense to
name them, too.

Research has shown that kids
form more of a bond with named ani-
mals, and this makes sense. It’s easi-
er to identify with Willie the Gorilla
than with Silverback No. 3. So, if
children visit the zoo and are
impressed watching Javier the
Hippo, it’s more likely that, later -in
life, issues of conservation and stew-
ardship Will make more sense’ to
them.-

The animals in the zoo come
from’ all over the world. They could
be given geographically appropriate
names — Zawadi the Zebra, anyone?
— which will also be good for kids
by exposing them to foreign culture
early on.

Getting people to care about ani-
mals is a lot easier when they have
names. The single greatest blow to
hunting? A cute little deer named

Bambi.

Our racial perceptions are not quite right  

There are only a couple things I remem-
ber vividly ﬁom high school —— the teachers
who loved me, the teachers who hated me,
andthe teachers I hated. But the one thing
that sticks out more than anything is my
social experience.

It was somewhat twist- ,
ed. Or maybe it wasn’t '““‘ *
Maybe twisted is the way it
is with everyone that grew
up like me, making it a nor-
mal experience. As a black
female, my upbringing has

students were Jewish
changed the way I thought,
talked, and performed —— both socially and

academically. On one particular day, I was

sitting in the stairwell Wiﬂt a couple of white
ﬁiends during our lunch break. A black sui-
dent walking down the stairwell approached
me and asked, “Why do you hang outwith
them? Don’t you know what they did to us?’ ’
At ﬁrst, I , was bewildered, then
appalled  you seriously talking about
slavery? That was, like, how many hundreds
of years ago!?” '
ThoughIcan’t saythatthis was my ﬁrst
wake-up call to the unresolved problems in

our society, it was deﬁnitely a reminder that '

some things never change — that some eyes
are never opened and others’ ears still remain
shut. Countless times, I’ve had people
approach me and say, “You didn’t sound
black over the phone!” or “You speak so
well!” when, in reality, my speech is just as
normal as any well-read person’s would be.
What I can’t understand is why it’s so hard
.to realize that we’re all human. ‘

" Yeah, we all look diﬁerent, but that’s it.

I wonder if Charles Darwin ever
thought about how he avoided natur-
al selection. Would he be so bold as
to say it was his superior intelli-

lucky? I’m guessing that folks like
Darwin put little emphasis on luck
and were comfortable saying things
happened for a reason.

Last semester, I wrote a column
about the psychological evils of win-
ter. I was dreading the long fight
against depression that I thought lay
ahead of me. Winters, especially
since I entered college, have taken
their toll on me. Freshman year, dur-

and February, I fell into a
three—month period of
self—destruction, gaining
50 pounds and suffering a
severe mental breakdown.

Last winter, I started,

to winter — March —— less than two
weeks away, I am pretty much in the
clear. ‘

Now, the real question was,
“How the hell did this happen?” I
think the answer became clear in my

head over a five-day span that _

included conversations with friends
and family. Through them, I realized
that I was very different from many
around me.

Since my first awful winter

freshman year and even during the ‘

second that followed, I have been on
a personal mission of self—discovery.
For the last two years, I have under-
stood education, weight loss, exer-
cise, religion, reading, and a rebirth
that has led me to right here, the end
of February, lying in rriy‘bed, not
crazy. . -

Over the weekend, I realized, by
comparison, how much confidence I
have in myself. I remembered how
little of it I had in high school and

s_aw my old feelings of hopelessness '

in others. I sympathize with them,
but no longer share in their outlooks.
I am doing just fine.

This semester, I was given the
great’, compliment of being called
“wise beyond my years.” If -this is
true, it is only because I have the
ability to emphasize only the parts of
life ,that matter. Perhaps because I

_ have the least amount of~money to ‘

my name right now of any point in

_ my life, I have seen with unfiltered

clarity the importance of friends and

family and have known the patience

needed to keep them together. I know
even more "so how ‘unimportant
school, work, money, diplomas, and
stuff really are, as they are nothing
more than "clever distractions and
means to an end that will-all burn
away in our older years.

If this winter wasn’t so. kind to

9 you, perhaps take some .time to sim-
‘ plify‘ your life. While that may be,

much easier said than done, remem-'

. ber not to get overly caught up in the

useless machinery of things. The
world does a fine job of making that
which is hollow seem valuable, and
we all do a good job of buying it.

Getting back to my I buddy
Darwin, I think Charlie knew that he
shouldn’t be ‘dead because ‘he had
work to do. He had an important
book to write. I think that purpose,
and more than just punching the time
clock at the end of the day, can keep
all of us going, because we can’t die
if we have work left to do.

Search and seizure protection must continue in post—Sept. 11 America

You’re standing next to your pickup
truck, smoking a cigarette, when a siren-
blaring police car pulls up and a uni-
formed officer gets out, demanding to see
your identiﬁcation. What would you do?

Most people would probably be a lit-
tle bewildered, a little anxious at the unex-
plained appearance of a cop, and maybe
they’d even start to feel a little guilty.
They’d comply right away, without think-
1118- . .

Dudley Hiibel, a 59-year-old cowboy,
was in just such a position in May of
2000, outside of Winnemucca, Nevada.
But instead of sheepishly handing over his
ID, he asked the ofﬁcer, “Why?” As in,
why do you need to see my identiﬁcation?

The officer, Humboldt County
Sheriff’s Deputy Lee .Dove, said he was
“investigating an investigation.” As Hiibel
continued to refuse, Dove’s justiﬁcation
shrank to “because.”

Earlier, Hiibel had been arguing with
his 17-year-old daughter, who’d been dri-

ving the pickup. They’d been shouting, '

and at one point, Mimi Hiibel punched her
father in the shoulder. An anonymous wit-

‘ ness called, the Sheriff’s Department to

report a domestic Violence incident. Out
came Dove, who found Hiibel and his
daughter pulled over, talking by the side
of the road. .

There’s no way Dudley Hiibel could
have known about the domestic violence
report. Dove made no attempt to explain
or to examine Mimi — who the caller
claimed had been “slugged” by her father.

Instead, he continued to demand
Hiibel’s identiﬁcation. After asking eleven
times. and being refused each time,‘the
deputy deemed. Hiibel uncooperative.
Dove handcuffed, Dudley Hiibel and
placed him in the back of the patrol car.

‘ Keep in mind that Hiibel had done
nothing illegal. Had Dove actually inves-
tigated, he would have" realized the
“domestic violence incident” never hap-
pened. Instead, Dudley Hiibel was arrest-
ed, simply because he had refused to pro-
vide identiﬁcation. . _ A

From the back of the patrol car, Hiibel
watched an assisting Nevada state trooper
pull his daughter from the pickup truck,
throw her face down in the dirt, and cuff
her. VV1th the alleged‘ Victim handcuffed
on the ground, Dove ﬁnally questioned
her.

Down at the hoosegow, Dudley
Hiibel was charged with domestic battery,
battery, acts which constitute domestic
violence, and obstructing/delaying a
peace officer.  Hiibel was charged
with resisting arrest. '

Since the “slugging” . had never

occurred, the battery charges were thrown

out. Mimi’s resisting arrest charge was
also dismissed, as there was no reason to
arrest her in the ﬁrst place. i

» The Charge of delaying a police ora-
cer, however, still stands against Dudley
Hiibel. According to the courts, his refusal
to show identiﬁcation gave police proba-

-never be sure of our neigh-

ble cause to handcuff and arrest him.
Dudley Hiibel has appealed all the way to
the Supreme Court, ‘which
will hear his case March 22.

not just to governments and police ofﬁ—

have to remain vigilant for the smallest
encroachment on freedom. Dudley Hiibel
knew the Bill of Rights and knew when it
was being violated. His case is useful to
remember at a time when no one can be

and secret trials, when our collective vigi-

threatens to tip over into paranoia -—— that
which destroys it.

Blown-glass objects showcase galaxy

Art Review

The Field and its Knower:
Lessons for an installation
Artist from the Far East
Margo Sawyer

Feb. 19 7 p.m.

Pittsburgh High School for the

Creative and Performing Arts
111 Ninth Street Downtown

V (412) 338-6100

ASHLEY RUSZKOWSKI
Senior Staff Writer

Walking into a dark room at the
Mattress Factory, viewers become
quiet, calm and reflective. They
stare into space at the blown-glass
objects that transport the mind to a
new and colorful galaxy.

They are viewing Margo
Sawyer’s exhibit, titled “Lux Lucis
Lumen.”

Sawyer, a blown-glass sculptor,
creates works in large-scale instal-
lations like the Mattress Factory
that are inspired by places she has
lived and traveled, such as Japan,
Burma and India. “I have always
been fascinated with sacred spaces
and what manifests a sacred space,”
Sawyer said. V

While living in Japan for a year
and a half, she said, she was able to
experience the way in which Zen,
meditation and practice are incor-
porated into the Eastern lifestyle.

She has witnessed the Ellora
Cave Temples. and Jantar Mantra

observatories in India. Others
include the Temples of Tofuku—ji
and Saio—ji of Japan.

With the ancient East in mind,
Sawyer focuses on putting viewers
in a meditative and reﬂective space
where they leave their worlds
behind. “It is a space of stilling and
quieting the mind. Conversations
stop, and [viewers] step away from
their wor1ds,” Sawyer said.

Interested in the relationship
between space and transcendence,

Sawyer focuses on elements of

Buddhism and Hinduism to capture

this. She states that her work is part ‘I

architecture,
part
scape. '
- Working wit
* the

Factory and

vas for
work has been
a m a z i n g .
According to
Sawyer, “It is
an amazing
institution. It
is about what-

wants with
full—breadth
support. I
teach and give
advice to others — rarely does it
happen the other way.”

While viewing this exhibit that

Sawyer describes as a “galaxy,” _

viewers should, Sawyer advises,
take their time, leave, and come
back to a work of art to discover,
over time, what the true meaning or
messageis. “Look closely at the
objects. Each object has its own
galaxy. [There is a] macro/micro
way of experiencing the work.”

Her work looks like mini—uni-
verses. Glass shapes —- many of
which look like vases of different
size and texture — are placed _on a
black backdrop, or rather,.in a_ dark
space. The glass figurines glow
with color and glisten with detail.
One image in particular looks like a
vase with a bright yellow base and
shades of yellow swirling to the tip
of the vase—like figure. '

Another year of vaginasshowcasedat David

Ladies, get your boyfriends to put
away their Playstations and make them
come out to watch “The Vagina
Monologues” with you this weekend.
It’s not a long walk to David Lawrence
Hall. But if your begging doesn’t work,
then grab a couple of your close girl-
friends to see Eve Ensler’s creation.

In case you’re unfamiliar with these
nationwide performances, “The Vagina
Monologues” is simply one Venue for
the V—Day movement. _

V-Day is a non—prof1t global group
created to raise awareness in stopping
violence against women and girls. Your
money goes to programs and organiza-
tions formed to ﬁght the violence.

In case you were curious, the “V”
in V-Day does not stand for Valentine’s.
Instead, the “V” symbolizes Victory
Valentine and Vagina. -

Ensler’s “The Vagina Monologues”

is translated in more than 25g_languages
around the world and wasiresponsible
for the start of the V—Day movement
itself.

Devoting her life to stopping vio-

lence against women and girls, Ensler_

wishes to see a world free of abuse one

day. Her message comes from her per- .

sonal experience with violence.

“The Vagina Monologues” draws
from Ensler’s interviews with more
than 200 women, originating out of

conversations from women who
approached her after her show. They
spoke of their own experiences, which
Ensler uses to reach out to her audi-

A CIICCS.

These performances and V—Day
itself have gotten their attention. In its
first five years, the V-Day movement
raised $14 mi1lion.'In 2002, $7 million
was raised. These are outstanding statis-
tics for a project that continues to grow
fast. , _

If you’re hoping to become more
cultured and contribute to a meaningful
benefit, then go out and see “The
Vagina Monologues” this weekend.
Raise awareness to stop the violence. V

Sping brea will e here soon!

From player to coach, Dieffenbach leads tennis team

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

Never stop learning, always stay
physically ﬁt and always stay positive.

That’s been George Dieffenbach’s
formula for suc— '
cess, and it is a
formula that has
withstood the test
of time.

Dieffenbach
has been a head
tennis coach at Pitt
for the past 28
years. In that time,

Doing well in the classroom is
something Dieffenbach has always felt
strongly about. In 1980, he received his
master’s degree in secondary natural sci-
ence education. He then earned his doc-
torate in the same ﬁeld in 1988.

“I feel as
though you should
never stop learn-
ing,” Dieffenbach
said. “Pitt was
‘very kind to sup-
port me in those
pursuits.”

In 1995, Title
IX forced Pitt’s

he’s seen the athletic‘ depart-
University, and ment to make a
especially the ten— number of
nis program, go changes. Oval

through many dra-
matic changes. ..

Dieffenbach’s
career at Pitt began in 1972, when he
joined the men’s tennis team as a fresh-
man. As a player, Dieffenbach enjoyed a
successful career. His 32 career singles
wins place him in a three-way tie for
11th in school history.

After graduating‘ in 1975,
Dieffenbach took over as the head coach
of the men’s tennis team at the age of 22.
He was forced to make the transition
from buddy to coach in only one year.
And it’s a transition he says took him
some getting used to.

“I was a head coach at 22,”
Dieffenbach said. “I was a player the

year before, then, all of the sudden, I go,

from being a friend to being a coach. It
was bumpy for a couple of years. You
can’t be friends with your players, but
you want to be right there with them the
whole way, helping them do well on the
court and do well in the classroom.”

    

COURTESY OF Prrr ATHLETICS

Jaynes, Pitt’s ath-
letic director at the
time, added
women’s soccer and softball as varsity
sports. But in order to balance outrthe
ratio of varsity sports offered to men
compared to those offered to women, the
decision was made to eliminate the
men’s tennis and gymnastics programs.
It was a hard time for Dieffenbach. The
decision came at a time when the pro-
gram was reaching its pinnacle of suc-
cess. .

“It was painful,” Dieffenbach said
of the elimination of the men’s tennis
program. “We had the best men’s team
in the history of the school when that

  «ai.

happened. We had just ﬁnished up eight .

winning seasons in a row. We had just
come off of a «huge win against
Connecticut. Our students took their
final exams, and after they had gone
home, I got a phone call from the athlet-
ics director to come in for a meeting. It

student athletes. To this day, I still feel

bad for those guys who lost their oppor-

tunity.”

One year after losing the men’s pro-
gram, Dieffenbach was able to turn
tragedy into triumph. After guiding the
women’s team to a successful season,
Dieffenbach received the Allegheny

Mountain District Coach of the Year

Award.

“I felt honored that they chose me
for that,” Dieffenbach said. “I’m just one
of a lot of- good coaches around here,
and it was nice that they thought of me
as [coach of the year].” '

In addition to coaching, Dieffenbach
is also a loving husband and father of
two. . ’

Dieffenbach also manages to find
time to run marathons. It’s something he
has been doing since I978. In 2002 and
2003, he qualiﬁed and completed the
Boston Marathon and is running it again
on April 19. Fitness is an important
aspect of life for Dieffenbach.

“I believe that you can never stop

, your ﬁtness,” Dieffenbach said. “You

need to keep active and keep compet-
mg.”

Last year, after the women’s team
had suffered its eighth consecutive loss,
Dieffenbach had just about run out of
things to say to his team.» He then
announced to his players that he did not
want to be called coach anymore. He
told them that his new name was “Mr.
Positive”. The team then responded by
winning nine straight matches.

“Those are some of the fun things
that are a part of coaching,” Dieffenbach
said. “My name is‘ still the same this
year.” '

Laura Pegula, the team’s top retum—
ing starter, says that the nickname is a
perfect description of her coach.

“George never says anything bad,”
Pegula said about her coach’s nickname.
“He’s always looking for the good in
anything.” _

Dieffenbachlooks at his team as an
extension‘ of his family. He feels that
strong team chemistry, solid communi-
cation and a positive attitude are what
can take a team to the next level.

“Its all about communication,” '
— Dieffenbach said. “Its all about players

working together as a team] of individu-
als to achieve things. Our talent level has
always been there, but I think when you
have strong communication between
players and coaches, that’s when you get
things done. We’re like a family out
there, and it’s hard to stop a team like
that.‘ This is the "best women’s team
we’ve ever had.”

At age 50, Dieffenbach says that
coaching keeps him feeling young.

Although he continues to get older, the .

players are always the same age. A

“It’_s like every year — I get a year
older,” Dieffenbach said. “And every
year, we continue to have freshmen
coming in. Even though I’m 50, I still try
to get to the players’ level in some way.”

Dieffenbach is planning on coach-
ing the women’s temiis team for another
eight years. He has set that target time
because he is hoping to have the oppor-
tunity to coach his daughter, Sarah, and
then retire when she graduates.

“I have a_ daughter who is a ninth
grader,” Dieffenbach said. “And it
would be great if she could come and
play for us. And then, in her senior year,
that would hopefully be my last year.

That’d be a good way to graduate my »

daughter and to graduate me. ‘Who
knows if it’ll all work out like that? I’ve
got to continue. to work hard and pro-
duce for this department until then.”

Men look to capture eighth straightBig East Championship

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

The Panthers’ men’s and women’s swimming and
diving team will begin competition in the Big East
Championships starting today and ending Saturday at

the Nassau County Aquatics Center in East Meadow,

N.Y.

Preliminary heats will be held each morning and
ﬁnals each evening during the three-day event. ’

On the men’s side, the No. 16 Panthers enter the
competition with a 12-2 dual meet record, including a
school record for wins in a season. The men have won
18 of the past 21 Big East Championships, including
the last seven in a row. It would be an understatement

to say that anything less than an eighth straight title‘
. for the Panthers would be a disappointment.

“Despite the fact that the conference is becoming
more challenging, I would say that we have a positive
attitude and that, more than likely, this year’s title is

ours to lose,” said head coach Chuck Knoles.

The Panthers are led by senior distance freestyle
swimmer Eric Limkemann, a six-time Big East
Champion, who will attempt to become only the sec-
ond Panther in Big East history to win an event four
consecutive years at the championships. The past
three years, Limkemann has won the 1650-yard
freestyle and once again is the favorite this year.

t Another Panther looking to conquer the same feat
is senior swimmer Randy Gertenbach, who has won
the 200-yard breaststroke the last three years at the
championship. V j -

On the diving side, the Panthers will be led by
senior Matt - Schwartz and sophomore Dennis

, Nemtsanov, who last year eamed»Honorable Mention

[basketball] game on Sunday —- Pitt was under a lot_

of pressure, but they came through. I think our kids
will do the same, because good athletes do their best
when they are under pressure.” . . I

The women will try to improve on last year’s
ﬁfth-place, finish at the championships. They will be
led by Honorable Mention All-American swimmer
Carolyne Savini, ‘whose specialty is the backstroke
and freestyle events. The Panthers will’ also look to
two-time defending Big East Champion Ryan
Redman in the 100-yard breaststroke.

Notre Dame is the team to beat for‘ the women.
The Irish will attempt to win their eighth straight
championship this weekend. _

“I would say, for the women, that Notre Dame is

probably unbeatable, but [I] realistically think we ,~

could finish as high as third, which would be a move
up from last year’s ﬁfth-place ﬁnish,” said Knoles.

Men’s D-III hockey prepares for
postseason appearance

The Panthers’ men’s Division III
ice hockey team will compete
against the Edinboro Fighting Scots
on Friday night at 9 p.m. at Island
Sports Center on Neville Island.

Pitt (6-12) clinched a playoff
berth with its 6-3 win over Penn
State-Altoona last Friday night. The
last time Pitt and Edinboro met, the
Panthers lost in overtime.

“They have a couple of good
offensive players,” general manager
Andy Mecs said, recalling the over-
time loss. Pitt, too, has some good
players on the offensive side.
Freshman Zach Cain has stepped
into a starting role and led the team
in goals, with 11.

“He makes things happen,”
Mecs said. “He came‘ in immediate-
ly and has been a real force.”

Also tallying points for Pitt dur-
ing the season was junior forward
Ty Heller. '

He finished the regular season
with, seven goals and 18 assists.
Both players notched a goal and an
assist in the game against‘ Penn
State-Altoona.

The only question mark for
Friday’s game is: who will be start-

ing in net for Pitt? Freshman goal-
tender Colin McCloskey started
most of the season, but has been out
lately because of illness. McCloskey

played in 12 games and went 4-8,

with a goals—against average of

5.872.
Freshman goaltender Brian
Chaya stepped in to replace

McCloskey and recorded his first
win against‘Penn State-Altoona.
Chaya allowed three early goals, but
stopped every shot that followed.
He stopped 18-of-21 shots in the
game.

The decision on who will get the
start in net will be made at game
time and will be based on
McCloskey’s health, according to
Mecs.

blocks in her 29 minutes of play.

The Huskies put it on cruise con-
trol during the second half and fin-
ished with a 97-42 victory. The 55-

. point loss drops the
Panthers to 6-17
overall, and 2-11 in
the Big East. The
Huskies’ victory
improves their mark
to 21-2 overall, and

as they look to repeat
as national champion.
“They
absolutely the best
team in the country,”
Berenato said. “This
was a great experi-
ence in Connecticut,
. and [Pitt is] sold out
for Saturday. I am glad our team got to
play in ‘'a sold-out game, before ours
this Saturday. Connecticut has what I
want to build at Pitt.”
The Panthers host Notre Dame on
Saturday and tip-off is slated for 2
p.m.

11-1 in the Big East -.

“It was an unqualified success

for us,” said team President Ben

Ristau.

The Panthers hurled the Frisbees
effectively through high winds and
finished perfect in Saturday’s pool
play, defeating Berry, 9-8, Radford,
10-6, Virginia Tech, 12-3 and
Georgia, 9-1. '

Sunday, Pitt faced Berry, a team
they defeated by a combined three
points in their last two meetings, in
the pre-quarter match. —

“They were fired up to get

_ another crack at us,” said Ristau.

Pitt broke an 8-8 tie at halftime
to win 13-10 and advance to the
quarterfinals against Rutgers.

Pitt star sophomore Brent
Bellinger went down in the first
half, and Pitt could not overcome a
7-2 halftime deficit as Rutgers elim-
inated Pitt, 13-6.

Ristau said that the team, which
includes 12 rookies, gained a lot of
experience and that the performance
bodes well for the rest of the year.

--— along with an evening practice on
Wednesdays — where the team
spends time on a rowing machine,
doing squats and running 120 flights
of stairs, starting at the bottom floor
of the Cathedral of Learning, up to
about the 30th. _ .

“I’ve played almost every popu-
lar sport, and no sport’s practice has

.ever had the difficulty or intensity

of crew,” said freshman rower
William Powers. “On top of that, the
5:30 a.m. time for it doesn’t_ make it

any easier.”
The team’s last event was the
Pittsburgh Indoor Rowing

Championships, hosted by the Three
Rivers Rowing Association. In the
event, Pitt crew produced multiple
winners who brought home gold,
silver and bronze medals, and the
team finished first overall.

“As a team, we pulled we11,”
Powers added. “Many people pulled
for a personal record, and others

even medaled. I think what every- —

one cared about the most, though,
wasn’t the overall win, just that we
beat Penn State.”

So far this year, Pitt’s crew team
has had numerous wins. at water
regattas and looks forward to having
a successful 2004 season.
