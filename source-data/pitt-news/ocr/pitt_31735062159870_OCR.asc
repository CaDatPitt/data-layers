Students who still hunt for parking places will 0
be skeptical over the news that the Pittsburgh

Parking Authority will attempt
the Oakland parking maze.

There has been no lack of solutions for the
problem put forward in the past, but ‘parking
lots close to the Cathedralare still full from 8:20
am. until evening classes are over.

On Dec. 15 of last year, members of the Re-
gional Planning Association were presented with ’

as the “great social, educational and cultural cen-

ter of metropolitan Pittsburgh.”

This plan called for increasing parking facili-

ties in the civic center area, and

  Dance

To_day’s meeting of the Pitt Chest
Council will decide the fate of the
proposed Pitt Chest all-student
dance, set for Friday, Nov. '16.

According to Ronald Eeker, Pitt
Chest chairman, then only thing
holding back ﬁnal arrangements is
a dance hall. A hall is being con-
sidered, but as yet, it is not known

« whether it will be free Nov. 16.

Jack Beerman, chairman of the
dance, has madearrangements for
entertainment, including celebri-
ties who will be appearing in
downtown night spots. Fraternity
and sorority entertainment will

‘round out the program...

CHEST SOLICITORS WANTED

All students who want to
conduct classroom solicitations
for the Pitt Chest Campaign
should contact Miss Malin, 801
C1, before 5 p.m. Monday.

' Beerman has been alloted $250
to complete arrangements for the
dance. It will be held ‘between
9:30 pm. and 1 a.m. The Pitt
Chest has gone’ to special pains,
Ecker says, in planning the dance
time in order not to interfere with
the Pan—Hellenic Council Recep-
tion, which will be held the sam
night. -

Admission to the dance will
‘ be by a $2 donation to the Chest
_ at the door or during classroom
solicitations. . .
The Student Congress social
committee has "approved the
’dance.

For the sixth consecutive semes-

the nation’s semiweekly student
newspapers. Granted by the Asso-
ciated Collegiate Press, the award
was given for last spring’s News.

The News was commended es-
pecially for its makeup and “hard-
hitting” editorials. Content and
editing of news matter were put
in the “excellent”-class. '

The ACP\judges singled out the
coverage last spring of the loyalty

blem and student elections for
special‘ commendations.

The SAE bus controversy was waxing hot among campus¢

politicos today.

  Campus , Pliticos Disagree  

‘On Statusof SAE Bus Trip

 

.. Jim Johnston, social committee chairman, said that if
the train had been a success the fraternity should have been

Vﬁned. He said that his committee,‘

composed of ﬁve women and ﬁve
men, were working on a redeﬁni-

_ tion, of a social function so as to -

include future bus trips in similar
situations.
I Not to Blame

IF Council President Joe Ed-
said the fraternities
could not be blamed for the fail-

‘tire of the train. “The fact that the

SAE’s had enough school spirit to
rent a bus and go to the game
shop,/s that fraternities do sup-

- port school activities.” He said he

did not believe the bus trip could
‘be termed a social event.

' -Comparing the two programs,
Jack Burwinkle said-, “They would
have been fools not to charter a
bus.” He explained that the SAE’s
left Friday evening and arrived
in East Lansing at about nine
o’clock. The next day there were

37 rooters in the Pitt section that
might not have been there other-
wise, he said.

Long Stay ~ -

They had another free night’s
lodging and another party before
returning the next morning.

On the other hand, he said, on
the Pitt train, they would have
arrived-at Michigan State Satur-
day morning for a free tour of the
campus before the game. They
would have had to leave at 12
o’clock Saturday night. ' .

Congress member Bill McKin-

ley said the SAE’s did not violate

present regulations but such reg-
ulations should be set up to cov-
er such things.

One congress member, who
wishes to remain anonymous said
that there was no rule to cover the
bus trip and there i should be no
rule preventing it.

Student Congress President, Cy-
ril Wecht, refused to comment on
the matter, saying that it will be
ironed" out at the SCimeeting Mon-
day.

19 reshmeny
H auled into
Upper Court

Nineteen freshmen were to ap-
pear at Upperclass Court yester-
day for not wearing_their dinks.

The four men previously called
before the court defended them-
selves by saying that no one else
wears dinks either. No further ac-
tion has yet been taken against
them.

Bert Sichelstiel, chairman of the
Court, says that in the future,
names of offenders will be turned
in, when necessary, to the‘ dean
of men’s office for further action.

Freshman Council members as
well as upperclass counselors have
been issued patrol cards and are
now reporting violators.

Members of the Upperclass
Court include Chief J ustice-Sichel-
stiel, Roger Bognar, Gene‘ Rock,
Lud Lippert, Ronald Ecker, Bob
McGuire, Wayne Harshberger, and

 -To Avoid a Last-Minute Rush A

Neds Senior Picture‘ Proofs

RIGHT IDEA—Senior Bill McKinley checks -his proofs with

representative of Owl photographer on the eighth floor. The photog-
rapher urges everyone to do as Bill does. ‘

“All seniors should return their
picture proofs as soon as possible
to the Owl ofﬁce on the 8th floor,”
says Alice Imhoff, Chidnoff Studio
representative.

In order to prevent a last—min—
ute rush, and to clear up unﬁnish-
ed details, proofs should be in by
Nov. 15. _

' “Students can have their ﬁn-
ished pictures in time for Christ-
mas if they bring them in now,”
Miss Chidnoff said.

Nov. 9 is the deadline for stu-
dents to have Owl portraits taken,
Editor Lezier Balk said.

Balk stressed that seniors need
not buy the Owl to have their pic-
tures printed in the yearbook. The
Owl photographer next week will
be?’ photographing seniors and
other students Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and
from 1 to 5 p.m. ~

Picture appointments should be
made as early as possible at the
Student Desk, Balk stressed.

Evening appointments may be
made for Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday from 6 to 9 p.m.

Throughout the U.S., student
governments, faculty groups and
other interested organizations have
been studying the results of estab-
lished honor systems and the pos-
sibilities of instituting more such
systems.

Conditions Not Favorable

In‘ the opinion of Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men, honor sys-
tems only work in institutions
where the conditions are favorable.

That is, where the student body is ‘

fairly small, known well to each
other and to the faculty.

“When classes are large,’’ he
added, “and the relationship be-
tween teacher and students is re-
mote, the chance of cheating is
great.”

“Pitt’s student body, however,
isn’t known to each other and the
conditions in general aren’t fav-
orable.”

Wecht Agrees

In agreement with Dean Biddle
is SC president Cyril Wecht who
believes that an honor system
would be highly impractical in a
school as large as Pitt.

Political Education ‘

S O With the general election coming up next week it is ap-
propriate that we exhort the _eligible members of the student
body to get out and vote. It is also appropriate that we make
a few passing remarks on THE student and politics:

  Every student who has reached the legal voting age
should have developed enough interest in affairs not im-
mediately personal to go to the polls and cast his ballot with-
out urging. We hope he will do so. ‘

_ '. But it is part of our American folklore ‘that students-
V are‘ political infants when they get off campus. Their naivete
isgnourished by the very institutions which are devoted to

developing and broadening their horizons.-

_'_Most colleges and universities have regulations which
prohibit any afﬁliation with the regular political ‘ groups.
These ‘same regulations serve to prevent the formation of
organizations devoted to political actions. - , ”’
 The feeling -on an ethical-level seems to be that politics
are‘ essentially corrupt, ‘therefore they should be kept off
.campus because they will corrupt the student, the - anti-
thesisof a univer_sity’s purpose. Our educators are not will-
ing to have our m6ral sense depraved while wesare on their
premises. ’ I — .
" _ _, It should be pointed out that those universities which
 depend on state funds are almost forced to prohibit political
"action.-The reasons are obvious and they provide the educa-
tors‘ with their best argument that politics are indeed cor-
rupt. It would be asking too much of a politician to expect
him to give‘ generously to a school that contained groups in
opposition ,-to his party.
 i The only outlet for political activity on American cam-
puses is "the sort of thing that goes on around» here ‘each
spring. We are expected to. devote our civic-senses to elect-
_- ing people to sit on councils which are, at best, insipid imi-
ations. _, - 4

‘ At‘ the same time we are condemned for being apathetic
to the larger sphere of national and state affairs off-campus.
We are expected to go through four years of education in
which politics are discussed only academically and then
come out as complete citizens.

‘ * 'I
' K.
'4. ’ W

-litical education is sufficient condemnation of our system.
7And it might be one good reason Why so many scoundrels
get "in office and why politics are as corrupt as they are
’ held to be. ’ ‘ p . .
Instead of blaming the public, the educators had better
, examine themselves. ’

A Rear View MIl‘I'OI‘ ,
A It is about that time in the school ‘year when
students are beginning to ponder on the value of

higher learning, or ‘rather on the higher learning

as they experience it. They wonder if it is all worth
the effort they put into it, or, again, the effort they
feel they put into it. p '
Much of the energy they would devote to pur-
suing that learning they expend
in aimless speculation, twistings
and turnings of the mind which
are most often expressed in the
sophisticated terminology of their
favorite subjects.
Their uncertainty is explained,\
and even given a certain nobility,

  
 

indicative‘ of. the vast rootless
ness and lack of purpose inherent

in the intellectually delicate in this country.‘ We of-

fer no haven for the sensitive. _ , _

The argumerit is presented that matters mental
are deprecated to the advantage of the "materialistic
endeavors. We are so engrossed in picking up a
buck that we have given it a stature Whichit doesn’t
deserve. ~ ‘ - '

‘Propaganda No Help

Despite all of-the free enterprise and rugged in-
dividual propaganda broadcast by the —American
Legion and others of its ilk, we have developed only
a, WPA attitude towards living.‘ We want every-
things easy. If it doesn’t come that way, we have
manufactured the ﬁnest set of rationalizations in the
history of mankind. -

They are manufactured right here in our lib-

eral arts courses, but they are manufactured inad-4‘ -

vertantly. ‘Instead of taking what they give us as"

English Language Threatened‘ _

Readers of this column who are interested in
what might happen to the English“ language if the

“a look at the following passage. It was brought

' Here is how it goes: - -

Michigan  Band .

Editor,
The Pitt «News .

Michigan State Collegeand all persons attend-
ing the Pitt—MSC football game this past Satur-
day were offered .a. great spectacle at halftime. A\
University of Pittsburgh _Varsity Marching Band‘
which thrilled the crowd with their precision and

formations at this game made our band look sick

in comparison. Their performance in my opinion
was greater than that of the famed University of‘
Michigan Band. Orchids to those bandsmen, the
University, bus drivers, and all those responsible
for affording the Midwest such a magniﬁcent treat.
Thank you fall.

guides for living, we take them as excuses for not "   All

living. They give us high sounding props tor our
failures. . , ‘
So, we can’t study, we can’t go away alone and

think. I do'ubt whether we ever wanted to do either, p  - I

but here is the answer. Just select a clause" or

phrase from the jargon of some study and you have 

your excuse and it even sounds romantic.

Blame the Country

Or we can blame it all on the youth of the.

country or on its size or on the small salaries paid
mental workers. But we don’t blame it on ourselves,

We are here ostensibly to get some knowledge it

and a degree, which will enable us to get some
place Where we can use that knowledge. The plant
is here, the rest is up to us.
_ Instead of picking out all of the fatalistic no-
tionsoﬂfered in courses, we ought to pick up some
of the indications that show us how to avoid the
situations __,that bring about the fatalism. And we
ought to lay oﬁ ourselves and give the books or
the instructors or. whatever it is we are concerned
with a break._ ’ ' ‘ ‘
For nothing does more to lower the morale that
a continuous dissertation on the depths to which

it has plunged. We can talk ourselves into deﬂeat. 

But, there probably is no answer. We are what

we are and we must make the best of it. Just"don’t . A

blame someone else for it. ,

And, instead of constantly" saying that our prob‘-'
lems are greater now that they ever" were, and
then using the”antidotes concocted years ago to
solve them, we ought to devise a few modern so-
lutions. The problems are essentially the same.

Just quite looking at life through a rear View
mirror.

rence vs. Grinnel, Tarkio vs. Friends, Bemeji vs.
Mankato, and Fresnovs. Occidental.

inches and picking Millikin over: North Central. .
News readers who have wondered whether the A
\“game—of-the-week” series is for real should be

glad to know that all games are regularly-scheduled

Sports Editor Don Murdock does admit, how-

rather small and that national interest is at a
low ebb for some of the games. '

‘Book Salesman Treated

The life of a book salesman is not always ‘a

_matter of getting your foot in the door and then‘
verbally battering it the rest of the way open.’ .
College senior Manuel Brodie found it just the —
other‘ way during his rounds with a well-known‘ i

encyclopedia last Tuesday night.

He found that as soon as he rang a doorbell
that night someone would rush to the door and
shove a sack of candy out to him. .At first he
ﬁgured it was just a local eccentricity in the‘ Pitts-
burgh suburb he Was working. -

Then, as he munched his way along, he re-
membered it was the night before Halloween
and open season for “tricking — or treating.”

in the School of Business Administration. Dr. Ty-'

son recalls that he wrote the poem many years
ago__ on a stormy day similar to last Wednesday.)

Injury Lisrfotals Five;
Freshman Trio Advance

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
It’s now ofﬁcial that the Panthers go through Hell every

day not just Saturday.

Tomorrow afternoon when ‘Pitt meets Rice Institute in
Houston, Coach Tom Hamilton will have ten of his regu-
lar starting eleven mended for action. '

But the rest of -the squad, well, ﬁve or possibly SIX
gridders will not answer roll call.

. Three Frosh Promoted

Four linemen—-centers John Da-
zio and Gabe Gembarosky, tackles
Otto Kneidinger and Gail Ellis—-
and halfback Bill Sichko did not
make the trip to Texas. The other
casualty, halfback Billy Reynolds,
accompanied the team but will see
only limited service.

J Hamilton promoted halfbacks
Paul Mikanik and John Jacobs and
center Bob Ballock to the varsity
for tomorrow’s game. With the
Panthers thin at center and in the
backﬁeld all three freshman re-
placements will see action.

Stuart Kline, 205-pound junior
center from Westmont, will start
at pivot for the Panthers. Kline, a
second-string utility man for two
years, has been shuﬁled around
from tackle to linebacker to center.
He replaces Dazio at pivot tomor-
row cwith Bill Ewing and Ballock

~ behind him.

« Owls Favorites
Mikanik,
from Follansbee, W. Va., was an

VAll-Ohio Valley halfback in high

school and ama-zed onlookers at
training camp with his running
and punting. He will spell Rey-
nolds at right half.

Rice and Pitt have tangled only
once, last year, and the Owls
championed, 14-7. This year the
sophomore-packed Texans have

Harriers Win, ’
Delaware Next

Case Tech’s gum-shoed harriers
went down to inglorious defeat
Wednesday afternoon at the hands
of Carl Olson’s thinclads, 15-48.

The victory not only provided
the locals their ﬁfth win in six
starts, but gave them their fourth
shutout.

Bernie Luterancik, rapidly de-

veloping into a truly powerful
runner, romped home with a
22:28.3 ﬁrst. Had he been pushed,
he may have made up the 20 sec-
onds which separated him from
the course record. ‘

Dion DelliGatti, Dan Sommer,
Ken Mahanna, and Frank Kuzma
followed Luterancik in that order.

Assistant Coach Lloyd Duff also

sent his JV’s into the run, and the ‘

varsity hopefuls, led by Chuck
Fritz, did admirably well. Al-
though they werenft counted in
the ﬁnal tally, three of the young-
sters ﬁnished ahead of four Case
varsity men.

Tomorrow, the harriers enter-
tain. a mediocre Delaware squad
at Schenley Park. The meet,
scheduled to begin at -1:00 p.m.,
will feature Olson’s regular start-
ers, with the JV ’s also slated to

record. The Owls are favorite by
two touchdowns.

Biggest threat to the Panthers is
the passing team of Dan Drake to
Bill Howton. Against Navy and
Southern Methodist the 6'2” left
end caught seven passes-——ﬁve of
them for 'l‘D’s. Howton is leading
all Southwest conference ends in
scoring.

More Records in Jeopardy

Pitt will counter with its great
record—breaking pass combination,
Bob Bestwick and Chris Warriner.
Bestwick will erase two passing
records tomorrow and Warriner
with 17 passes caught nears Nick
DeRosa’s mark of 25 passes caught
for one season.

grabs to better Bill McPeak’s rec-
ord of six TD’s scored during a

Sports Editor ,

_ Pitt could have won its ﬁrst ﬁve games. If not all ﬁve,
at least one, but undoubtedly more.

_ i In 1948 and 1949 the colleges and
throughout the south and midwest began their whole-
sale raiding of western Pennsylvania looking for foot-
ball talent and in most cases getting what they wanted.

The Panther family sat back on their haunches and

,- «Page   N'EW'S—-Friday, Niovernb-er”2,

  

 

universities

watched Notre Dame, Miami, Ohio?
. State, Duke, Kentucky and a ﬂock '

of others grabbing Pennsylvania
school boy prizes.

‘Jock’ Was Right
We called these boys ‘disloyal

ii sons’. Now we realize that they
_ ‘were perfectly right in going else-

where to further their football ac-

' tivity.

-Looking back on the Pitt foot-
ball scene We'also realize that
.Dr. John Sutherland was per-
fectly right in desiring better
football players for the Panth-
ers. ' ~ ~
But Pitt wouldn’t listen to the

_single wing expert at that time
- and the de-emphasized Panthers

met one defeat after another dur-
ing the war years and after the
war until Mike Milligan brought
the team its ﬁrst winning season
’ in 1948. '
Alumni Can Help
The colleges throughout the
country began their raiding tactics
and the Panthers once again hit
the bottom. . '
Who approaches these Penn-
sylvania boys for other schools
and who persuades them to en-
roll away from home? It’s‘ sim-
ple-—the "alumni.
Here at Pitt We have an alumni.
And it’s a strong outﬁt too. In
-September 12,000 of them were in-
.vited to attend the intrasquad
game at Ligonier. Less than 100
showed up. ~
Living in the Past
' But they know how to squawk.
They yelled long and hard when
Len Casanova was appointed head
coach. They wanted a Pitt alum-
nus, a._single wing man just like
‘Jock’.
Jock—a Pitt graduate who left

 

$1/_, million to Scotland upon his
death. He even sent a Cadillac
automobile given him by the
city of Pittsburgh to S_cotland.~-
0 But nary a cent went to Pitt.
-Two years ago Captain Hamil-
ton started a program to get high

school players interested in com-
ing to Pitt. He has succeeded."
Seven sophomores and 12 fresh-.
men are making the trip to Rice.’
Boys like Ray Ferguson, Lou Cim-
arolli, Paul Blanda, and Henry
Ford are going to make life easier
for Panther coaches in the future.

Credit Hamilton

And except for a few of the
alumni the credit must go to Ham
ilton. . '

So in the future when the
Panthers are a winning outﬁt,
let’s hope so, remember to place
the credit where it belongs-—to
Hamilton and a few alumni mem-
bers who want to see Pitt get
ahead in the world of sports.

But not to those alumni mem-
bers who are bound to Squawk at
the announcement of Pitt’s next
football coach.‘ These are the
alumni who watched the Pitt-Duke
tilt on television. ~

The biggest and most ambitious schedule in Pitt swim-
_ming history—l3 dual meets and the Eastern Collegiates—
has been pooled together for Ben Grady’s swimmers this

year.

. With'the YMHA still furnishing Pitt’s home pool, the
mermen make only‘ four home appearances, the remaining
10 all carded for enemy Waters. .

Columbia and Army, both perennial top-notch outﬁts,

have been added to a schedule that‘

12 Lettermen Return.

Rutgers and Penn have been
dropped because of schedule con-
ﬂicts and Penn State is missing
because the Nittanies dropped in-
tercollegiate swimming last spring."

With the returning 12 lettermen
and outstanding freshmen and
sophomore prospects coming up,
the Panthers should better last
year’s 7-2 record despite the tough
opposition. " _

Only two regulars, divers .Al
Ciocca and Jim McHale, are miss-
ing from last season’s squad. How-

mer,‘is a possible loss if he enters
dental school.

"The victors displayed fancy ball

the bruising attack which kept the
opposition hemmed in throughout

Castoﬁs had piled up a 26, point

the rough play that’ the Johns-

Mr. Duff is running for judge’ of the Common Pleas

becoming a judge. To a lawyer it’s
like growing up,” said the law
professor. '

  

was, he said, “A candidate for the
judiciary should not have a polit-
ical platform; he should be elected
on integrity, knowledge of the
law, and experience in practicing
the law-.”

When Mr. Duff graduated from
Pitt law school in 1908 he receiv-
ed an award for the highest grade
in his class. ' -

He was admitted to the bar in
1_908,.began a private practice as
a civil lawyer and started teach-

44 years. -' I

At least the facts revealed by
June graduate Andy Schurman,
now a student in the Graduate
School of" Retail Training, would
seem to indicate’ this.

The 90 members of his class
who are, comparatively, freshmen
in the graduate sclriool give 100
per cent backing to school drives
and campaigns, Schurman says.
They have picnics, parties, and
barn dances, and are planning a
combined shopping tour and pleas-

February.

This group even has itsown in-

personnel and management teams

A grant of $15,000 has been
given to the School of Business
Administration to be used in mak-
ing a survey of the problems in-
volved in, converting old one-
family homes into apartments.

Under Bus Ad School

Under the direction of '_ Dr. Ar-
chibalc; Woodruff, of the School
of Business Administration, the
people who have obtained permits
to do such conversion work are
questioned concerning their re-
sults. ‘ _

This information serves the
government two—fold: (1) It helps
prevent devaluation of neighbor-
hood property by keeping conver-
sion standards up; (2) in case of
war the government ,will know
how best to convert large houses
to accomodate a maximum of peo-
ple. ‘ "

In .the course of their research,
the staff has discovered (some pe-
culiar and interesting situations._

In one instance, a building per-
mit had been obtained to con-
vert a one-family A home into a

‘number of smaller apartments.

Upon‘ investigation, it was found

that the home had instead been
converted into a church.

Alumni Secretary Plans Festivities

By CLARK’ SUTTON

This year’s Homecoming will be the sixth that J. Clyde
Barton has handled since he became general alumni secre-

tary in 1945.

Mr. Barton sayshis biggest problem during -these years

Blood Donors
Urged To Keep

Student Congress blood

today emphasized the neces-
sity for all blood donors to be

ments in Stephen Foster so-
cial room. -

All donors’ received post
cards ‘scheduling them for ap-
pointments at the bloodmo-

- bile, Rock said, and each per-
son’s appearance on time will
enable everyone to be moved
through" easily. .

Over 400 signed up to give
blood in the Congress-spon-
sored campaign, and by
Thursday noon, no scheduled
donor had- failed to make good
on his pladge. _ '

moted to sergeant in Korea for

$has been with the alumni who

neglect to make ‘reservation. They
then show up the day the festivi-
ties begin expecting everything to
be ready for them. _

“We make arrangements for
them,” Mr. Barton said, “but it
certainly throws our whole plan
out of gear.” '

His biggest surprise came last
year when the Homecoming com-
mittee arranged buses to carry the
alums to Pitt Stadium after the
buffet luncheon at the Webster

L Hall Hotel.

Preferred ~Walki,ng

Much to his surprise, the grads
preferred to walk up the hill to
the Pitt—Miami game.

“It seems,” Mr. Barton reasoned,
“that the shoving of the crowds

_and the renewing of old acquaint-

ances is part of the excitement.
They like to ‘gripe about the hill,
and it _isn’t a game unless they
do.” v

— This year Mr. Barton believes
he is “playing it smart” by cutting
down the number of buses.

“But I'll bet you that I’ll ﬁnd
they all want to ride,” he said with
a wide grin. —

[to B-Movie

By JOHN KULAMER ~_
If you approach the Pitt Players’ ﬁrst production of the
‘season, January Thaw, with an open mind, and don’t expect
too much, you’ll probably come away feeling that the time

spent Watching it has not been

wasted. _.

On the stage of the Foster Me-
morial auditorium you will see
most of director Harvey Pope’s
“kids,” as he calls them, giving

-pretty competent performances

Morgret Good

Dee Morgret, who plays the lead
in the romantic sub-plot, carries
off her part with ﬁne composure,
and consequently is the most gen-
uine person in sight. Hazel Hal-
lam‘ does a convincing job with
the part of Sarah, the adolescent
tomboy, and Joan Lisotto deserves
a lot of credit for her handling of
a tricky’ role: that of the ﬁighty
and dim-witted Mrs. Gage.

Jerry Meyer, the best of the
male performers, manages to stay
properly exasperated in his Edgar
Kennedy role of Mr. Gage, and
Paul Pavlov .as the Rockwoods’
son, Matt, is worthy of mention.

Plenty of Laughs ,

The chances are.that you will

also come away from- January

‘ Thaw feeling that you’ve had your

share of laughs for the evening.

7 The gag lines and funny situations,

of which the play has a good sup-
ply‘, are for the most part Well

,handled by the cast. One little

pantomime involving a chamber-
pot is a pretty good kick.

If you insist on being critical,

however, you’re bound to notice
that the Players’ offering has
some glaring weaknesses. For this

Director Pope himself is to blame,

because most of them could have

been avoided by choosing a better

play. ‘
Plot is Trite

Trite is about the fairest word
one can use to describe the plot of
January Thaw. All the very obvi-
ous and very overworked plot de-
vices are there, such as the dream
of Mrs. Gage which foreshadows
the coming of the Rockwoods to
the Gage household,.and Mr. Gage
being called away by, of all things,
a ﬁre alarm when it’s necessary fgr
him to be absent for a while (you
ﬁnd out he’s a volunteer ﬁreman
while he’s pulling on ‘his boots.)

After a while you get the feel-
ing that you’ve seen all this some-
where before, namely in the last
B-picture you took in.

But if you’ve been planning to
see January Thaw, don’t let this
scare you off. Go and see it any-
way; if you don’t you’ll no doubt‘
spend the time watching a movie
that’s no better, and probably
much worse.
