Social  
media can
injure job
prospects

Natalie Daher
Staff W riter

In 2010, CEO Paul Furiga’s down-
town Pittsburgh public relations
ﬁrm was hiring interns. When
Furiga decided to look over his
potential future employees’ social
media proﬁles, the last thing he
expected to ﬁnd was an unhidden
album of explicit photos. I

A male friend of one of the
ﬁrm’s female internship appli-
cants had posted a collection of
photos full of “so—and-so’s chest,”
as Furiga described it, and the
intern-to-be was unaware that
those candids even existed on
her page.. 1

“We hired her, but we, did have
a conversation with her about it,”
Furiga, the CEO and president
of -downtown PR ﬁrm Wordwrite
Communications, said.

Not everyone will get that
lucky.

Before the explosion of cyber-
space, employers once relied on
the carefully chosen references
listed on a candidate’s paper resu-
mé in order to gain further insight
on the applicant. But today, with
the click of a mouse, employers
can ﬁnd out all —— and sometimes
more — than they need to know
about a prospective employee.

District 8 Councilman Bill Peduto’s
entrance into the Pittsburgh may-

‘ oral contest has led to awide-open

race to replace him in Pittsburgh
City Council District 8, which in-
cludes part of Pitt’s campus.

There are currently three Dem-
ocratic candidates who have an-
nounced their campaigns to ﬁll the
soon-to-be—vacant District 8 seat.
The district encompasses much of
the"East End of Pittsburgh, includ-
ing North Oakland, Bloomﬁeld,

Dan Gilman, who is a friend of
Peduto and works as the current
chief of staff for the mayoral candi-

percent of companies check out the social
media sites belonging to applicants, and
the content employers discover could earn
or lose someone the interview.

As the saying goes, first impressions.
are, in fact, everything. The study showed
that the largest percentage of employers
(65 percent) delve into social media in

‘ order to judge whether or not a potential
candidate projects a professional image.

For employers such as Dennis Piper,
owner of Pittsburgh accounting ﬁrm Den-
nis Piper and Associates, a professional
image above all is of utmost importance
for a candidate’s online appearance. This
means that those drunkenphotos from a
bar in the South Side will have to hit the
recycling bin, or at least be reserved for
the bedroom rather than virtual wall. Piper
estimates that 10 to 15 percent of his initial
evaluation of candidates depends on their
social media presence, while 85 percent of
their chances still rest on their resumés.

“I’m looking at it as ‘What image are .

you presenting out there [on Facebook]?’

 

_ _.‘_ . 

I can’t even imagine why people do half
those things on Facebook or Twitter — it
bafﬂes me.” T
Piper, a member of an older generation,
describes himself as a “private individual.”
Unfortunately, discretion on the Internet
can be a’ challenge for today’s young and
incoming workforce, especially when most
of them have been operating on social me-
dia sites since about the ninth gr‘ade. But
for Piper, broadcasting excess personal
information onto a social network is code
word for a lack of adequate time spent on
other valuable activities such as studying
and applying one’s self. . '
“If you want to tell the world that you
were at the beach, that’s ﬁne. I don’t like

' the concept, but that’s my prejudice,” he

said. “Do something constructive besides
put useless crap on Facebook or Linkedln.
That reﬂects upon you, your work ethic
and’ your social values.’-’<

While the interview is often the time
for candidates to present the most posi-
tive image of themselves, hiring managers
like to search social media to get a glimpse
of candidates in their n'atural habitats.

According to the CareerBuilder research,

social media snooping is used by 51 percent

of employers to assess whether a candidate
would ﬁt in with the corporate culture, 45
percent to discover more about the candi-
date’s skills and 35 percent to determine if
the candidate is well-rounded.
Additionally, employers report turn-
offs they encounter when reviewing job
candidates online. In ranking order, they
include: provocative photos or informa-
tion, information about drinking or drugs,
poor communication skills, back talk about
a previous employer, discriminatory re‘-

~marks and lies about qualiﬁcations. , .

Furiga said he especially determines
the quality of someone’s communication

skills by reading their tweets. He ﬁnds that '

college applicantsoften either have their

Twitters unnecessarily locked or converse ,

about juvenile topics.

“Crazy hashtags, blonde girl problems,
sorority girl problems, FML this  A.1ot of
profanity, a lot of really personal stuff like
live ‘tweeting during TV shows that people

like, about stupid things [like] party stuff,” .

he mentions. “That’s the area that I ‘see a
lot of issues these days.”

The most unimpressive Twitter page’

would look something likea private net-

i work‘ for friends: a following of 15 people

and a mass of 8000 tweets, according to
Furiga.

“You don?t really have anything to say
to the world at large,” he said. “You are
talking to each other every single second
of every single day about things that no-
body cares about. Those people, we don’t
interview.” ' pp
. Ashley Moss, owner of Hello Produc-
tions, an event planning and public re-
lations ﬁrm, gets her ﬁrst glimpse of a
potential employee’s appearance through
a Google search.‘ She deems photos that
include risque clothing and extreme situ-
ations of either making gestures or falling
to the ground as an automatic red ﬂag. But,
somewhat unlike Piper, she ﬁnds photos of
candidates on the beach in a bikini toler-
able, given that the lack of fabric is at least
weather appropriate.

Furthermore, “if they’re drinking wine
with their friends, and they’re the legal
age, that’s ﬁne,” Moss said. '

' Social media is not always vindictive.

_When used properly, it can embellish a

candidate’s credentials. According to Ca-

resident, he says he understands the issues

“I have been in the community meeting,
helping and working with people for years. I
have worked with low—income communities,
was one of the ﬁrst to advocate for the LGBTQ
community in Pittsburgh and all others in
trying situations,” Hens—Greco said.
Gilman, 30, also hopes to win the vacant
District 8 seat. According to the Pittsburgh
City Paper, Gilman has worked in every neigh-
borhood in the East End of Pittsburgh. He is
also a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University,
making him familiar with the Oakland area.

_ said, “You’re hired,” as a result of a social
media site. The most frequently cited rea- '

sons include’ quality insight on personality,

professional image, variety of interests, -I

superb communication skills and positive
references from other people.

Furiga said he appreciates Twitter pages
that offer interesting and not strictly per-
sonal tweets, engagement with followers
and conversation that sheds light on sig-
nificant beliefs and opinions._

“If somebody wants to be in medicine, I
would expect to see some content of things
that interest them about their ﬁeld,” he
said. ‘ .

Piper uses social media as a resource
to confirm a candidate’s resume, and he
is most impressed by attractive and orga-
nized pages that might even provide him
with some talking points if he decides to
follow up on an interview.

But not all employers use social media
as an investigative tool.

According to Mary Beth Allen, campus
recruiter at Ernst and Young, the com-
pany does not utilize social media sites
such as Facebook and Twitter as vehicles
to identify and source candidates. Rather,
the company’s presence on these sites is
designed to create a page where candidates
can reach out to them and learn about the
ﬁrm around the clock. Additionally, Al-
len noted that Ernst and Young does use
Linkedln as a means to connect with po-
tential recruits.

For those students whose Facebooks
have already celebrated multiple birthdays,
doing away with the old photos and posts
can seem like a daunting task. Applications
like SimpleWash save students a step as
theyapply for internships and j obs by scan-
ning Facebook pages for language that is
unfit for an employer’s eye._ Other services
such as Socioclean aim to make Facebooks
in tip-top shape. '

Piper offers the following maxim for ad-
vice: “The spouting Whale gets harpooned.”
In other words, the ‘more you decorate
your social media page, the greater risk

you run of endangering your employment '
. prospects. Choose wisely. I ‘

“I am running a campaign based on both
experience and vision. Over the past nine
years, I have worked on thousands of_'neigh—
borhood issues,” Gilman said. “I know the
community leaders, business and institu-
tional leaders and government oﬂicials.”

One of these issues, he said, was outdated
technology in East End neighborhoods and
the city as a whole.

Regardless of who wins the City Council
and mayoral elections, there are serious is-
sues that facing Pittsburgh that will need to
be dealt with in the coming years. According
to the.City Demographic Information, two of
the biggest issues are a declining population
and the decline of traditional neighborhood
business districts. -

But the District 8 seat is only oneof four

City Council seats up for grabs in Pittsburgh -

this election cycle.

Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith is the
incumbent for the District 2 seat. There are
currently no announced opponents for her
seat. District 2 encompasses many areas in
the West End of Pittsburgh, such as Crafton
Heights,‘ East Carnegie and Mount Wash-
ington. Z

A Councilwoman'Natalia Rudiak, the upset

‘winner of the 2009 election, is this election’s

incumbent hailing from District 4. Rudiak
faces fellow democratjohn Lee of Brookline,
a former high school basketball coach and
postal worker. District 4 serves the areas of
Beechview, Bon Air, Brookline, Carrick, Mt.

Washington and Overbrook.

Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle is hoping to
retain his seat on council for District 6, the
area that encompasses the Strip District, the
Hill District, the North Side and Downtown.
His opponent will be Franco “Dok” Harris,
the son of Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame
running back Franco Harris. _

, . “Dok” Harris unsuccessﬁilly ran for mayor
against Luke ‘Ravenstahl in 2009, and this
year he is supporting Peduto for mayor.

The Democratic Primary Election —
which will determine the democratic can-
didates for both City Council seats and the
upcoming mayoral election — will take place
May 21, and the general election is scheduled
to take place Nov. 5. I

Further distressing might be the fact
that in 1968, the minimum wage was worth
$10.47 in today’s dollars. According to the

Organization for Economic Cooperation-

and Development, the United States is
near the bottom of advanced nations when
it comes to theratio of minimum wage to
median wage. For example, in Australia,
the minimum wage now tops $15, and un-
employment is at 5.4 percent.

Even state—elected legislators realize
the need for increases in base pay. Since
last December, all state senators and rep-
resentatives have beneﬁted from a 2.2 per-
cent raise because of an increased cost of
living in Pennsylvania.

Yet there is another perspective to
consider as well. There are just as many
concerns with simply increasing the rate
in the Keystone State, or any state for that
matter. ‘ l

I remember working part—time at a pop-
ular supermarket in Pittsburgh, making a
couple dollars above minimum wage while
attending school back in 2007. The federal
minimum wage was increased nearly $2 by
2009. Suddenly the new hires were making
just as much as I was. While I felt this was
unfair, what was even more dramatic was
the obvious increase in the price of our
products being sold.

With increased labor costs come in-
creased product costs. Since these prod-

   

CHEERLEADER TRYOUTS  

ucts were items found in a supermarket,
the cost could be felt in the wallets of ev-
eryone involved.

Ultimately, after the result of two years

of hard work, the buying power of my wag:

es was the same as when I began; I found
myself only being able to afford what I

could back in 2007, before the baseline
I wage hike.

Additionally, there’s a good bit of re-
search that indicates that signiﬁcant job
loss was the direct result of the federal

prices. Moreover, evidence from a large
number of academic studies shows that,
even if there were no negative employment
or other effects, minimum wage increases
do not reduce poverty levels.

So what do we do? There is research
favoring both sides to this debate. We
want to improve living conditions, but
just broadly raising wages has its draw~
backs too. .

The best solution is to turn the deci-
sion of minimum wages completely back

This empirical research generally
finds thatiythe  a I minimum

government raising the wage back in 2009.
This empirical research generally ﬁnds

that the higher a minimum wage increase‘

is relative to the competitive wage level,
the greater the loss in employment op-
portunities. A decision to increase the
minimum wage is not cost-free; someone
has to pay for it.

Research shows that low-skill youth pay '

forgit by losing their jobs, while consum-
ers might also pay for it through higher

$300

 Winner
Take

to, state legislatures. We abolish a federal
minimum wage in favor of state limits.
While it might be hard to implement,
there is a major problem with having our
current approach to dealing with minimum
wage at the federal level. In a very diverse
country, wages should be determined at a
state or even a local level based on the cost
of living in that part of the country. This
will help mitigate the negative effects of
minimum wage increases. ‘

We need to encourage state- and local-

level wages based upon cost of living data.

Many states vary widely. Hawaii and
New York, for example, are among the
nation’s most expensive places to live, yet
the minimum wage equals that of Penn-
sylvania, which is usually ranked in the
bottom half.

But even state control might not be
enough. Within states, wages vary, typical-
ly along urban—rural divides. While Penn-
sylvania falls below average, according to
the Economic Research Institute, student
cost of living in Philadelphia is 51 percent
over the national norm. Yet the minimum

I wage is the same.

To be clear, states can already decide
to raise the minimum wage over the fed-

eral minimum. But with the presence of

a federal level, minimum wages are not
diverse enough to reflect different costs
of living between states, let alone within
them. In the case of Pennsylvania, one of
the most starkly divided states in the na-
tion between urban and rural areas, we can
clearly see that a uniform level is flawed.

Encouraging state and local minimum
wage regulation will ensure that workers

-are getting paid fairly and that businesses

will not be forced into dramatic price in-
creases. In a country as diverse as the U.S.,
where one state can differ greatly than the
next, emphasis on federal minimum wage
regulations should be moved to a focus on
state minimum wage regulations. I

Jasper Wilson
Assistamf Sports Editor

On awinter Wednesday night on up-
per campus, Trees Hall appears dead
and empty: The only apparent living
soul in the building is the security
guard sitting at a cream- colored desk
near the entrance. But wander down
a hallway and‘ through a door that
says “Do not enter,” and the building
comes to life.

Standing on the elevated deck
above Trees Pool, one can see aﬂurry

-of activity below. On the near side,

the varsity diving team ﬁnishes up
a workout. And in the far corner of
the wide-open area, headcoach Alex
McLaren leads members of the Pan-
ther Swim Club through a collection
of stretches and exercises.

Since its creation at the begin-
ning of last school year, the club
has grown markedly. What initially
started as a Facebook group of about

10 freshmen before they even arrived '

on campus has become a club of 83
people paying dues this semester,
any of whom might make up the 40
or so swimmers attending practice
on a given day.

The club’s growth rate has sur-
prised President Kevin Steehler, a
sophomore who was among those

founding freshmen, and the other‘

ofﬁcers. -

“It’s come a long way,” Steehler
said. “We’ve deﬁnitely expanded a
lot. We’ve had to kind of get used to
the fact that we’re a much bigger team

    

Members have competed in two competitive meets so far this year,

..  _’:g~_3

the first of which was at Slippery Rock. Courtesy Panther Swim Club

than we were last year, but I think
we’re doing well with it.”

Last weekend, the club competed
in a seven—team meet at Penn State —
its second of the year —- and placed
third in the women’s competition,
ﬁfth in the men’s category and third
overall. The team also won its meet
at Slippery Rock University in De-
cember.

Steehler described how last year,
before the club had its own pool time
——- it now has fourscheduled pool
times per week after recreational

swim — members would utilize any '

empty lanes. And then when the pool
started to get crowded in the winter,
members had to tell_people to-move

out of the lanes. A
“There was avery limited number
of people that we could have go to
practice, because if we had more than
20 we couldn’t really ﬁnd more than
three lanes to practice in. So our team
was kind of small,” he said. ~ _
Attendance for practices last year
ranged anywhere ﬁ'om fewerthan six
people to an average of 15. ‘
As one of the few clubs that does
get to use on-campus varsity facili-
ties, Panther Swim Club was happy
with whatever it could get. .
While the group do esn’t teach
people how to swim, it does welcome
a- wide range of participants: those

‘ swimming for the exercise of it and

    

accomplishes a lot, isn’t ﬁnished  

others for the competitive aspect.
“Weallow people to make what
they want of our team,” Steehler said.
Thiscombination means prac-
tices also have to reﬂect this wide
range of participants, an adjustment
thatwas realized after some trial and
error, according to club Vice’ Presi-
dent Anvita Sanker. _
“Originally at the beginning of
the year, we were planning on doing
meets, and we were having every-
body do the same practices,” Sanker
said. “[But then] we tried to balance
‘between the people who wanted to
be more competitive and the people .

_ who wanted a more relaxed swim-

ming environment, so we offered
three different time intervals.” '

The laid-back environment at
practice is something members
value. ‘

“Everybody still loves swirmning,
but I don’t think everybody has the
commitment to do it like the actual
Pitt team,” Sanker said. “It’s not as
intense as the actual team, and it’s
a lot more relaxed, so I think people
really like that atmosphere.”

That said, many members of the
group see it as acompetitive club and

- got involved because they missed be-

ing exposed to a competitive envi-
ronment. Business manager Mark
Cinquegrani explained that while ~
members are only required to at-
tend practice two times aweek, “The

North Carolina Tar Heels. _
Pitcher Savannah King enters her

' sophomore season as the Panthers’

ace. After setting multiple Panthers
softball records in her freshman cam-
paign, including mostwins (19), an»
pearances (40) and innings pitched
(227.1), Kingwillbe counted on time
and again to pitch numerous impor-
tant innings for Pitt. .
“We are looking forward to get-
ting back to getting on the ﬁeld and
getting back to playing in some nice

weather,” said King."‘The preseason ~

practice can get long, but it builds

the anticipation and excitement, es- -

pecially when you are playing those
top teams right off the bat.” ‘
The battery combination of King

and senior catcher Holly Stevens will

’ lead the Panthers on the diamond for ‘

a majority of games this year. Stevens
.— Pitt’s all-time home-run leader -
is the only senior on a roster with 14
of its 16 total players in their .ﬁrst or

King isn’t allowing the squad’s
youth to alter what sheexpects the
team to accomplish.

“Even though we are young, I
have a lot of high expectations for
this team,” she said. A .

A challenging schedule awaits the
young Panthers squad as they will
face 11 teams that advanced to the
NCAA tournament last season. '

King sees the schedule as an op-

conference standings, meaning a
Pitt victory Saturday could push
the Panthers (20—5, 8-4 Big East) to
the top of the Big.East depending on
the results of other games involving
teams near Pitt. ” .

In the ﬁrst contest on Jan. 12,
Pitt fell to Marquette 74-67. Most
fans will remember the game for

with it are used to practicing  days a week

’ -for six hours, so four hours aweek is nothing.”

The team joined a swim league this year
after realizing that it could balance being com-
petitive without sacriﬁcing the inclusiveness
that it feels is central to what the club is about.

“It originally started as just to keep swim-

.‘ ming for an activity,” he said. “Then we started
to realize that we missed competing a lot and
wanted to do it and tried to ﬁnd a league that
wasn’t too intense for us, and we could still
compete.”

Cinquegrani learned about the club from
secretary Emily Scanga, who was in his Ital-

. February I5, 2018 l The Pitt News | v\/vwv.pittnevve.com

ian class during the ﬁrst semester of last year.
When they both mentioned that they swam,
she suggested he join.

For all of last year and for the beginning of
this year, the club didn’t have a coach, leaving it
to the oﬁicers to instruct their peers and design
practices while swimming themselves, a task
for which assistant aquatics director and club
adviserjason Miller thinks they deserve credit.

“They’d write the workouts, and they would
try to swim the workout that they had written,
but they found themselves kind of having to
get out and coach at the same time, and that’s
really difficult,” said Miller, who swam on the
varsity team at Pitt from 2002 to 2006.

Cinquegrani explained the challenge. “You ,

had to try and teach these people how [to swim]

while you’re trying to swim yourself and get
back into shape, and it was just too much jug-
gling,” he said.

McLaren also swam for Pitt (2007-2011)
and is nowavolunteer assistant coach with the
program. He came across the club one night in
November when he walked by the pool during
one of the team’s practices.

“Swimrning’s a tough sport, and it’s some-
thing rarely that you do without a coach or that

much self-motivation like that group does,”

McLaren said. ‘‘I was really impressed.”
McLaren began coaching the team volun-
tarily not soon after. Varsity freshman swim-
mer Matt Tankle often helps him.
“You gotta be [mentally] tough to do this
sport,” McLaren said. “When you’re exerting

yourself, there’s no really cool scenery. It’s a

» lane on the bottom of the pool or the ceiling if

you’re doing backstroke.”

“I think they’re becoming more motivated,
and they’re just buying into everything that I’ve
provided them with as far as training, which
is really cool.” . '

Sanker joined last year at the suggestion
of one of her ﬂoormates who was considering
joining as well, but ended up doing another
sport. She said that when she joined there were
“maybe 20 people, if that.” This year, before
McLaren j oined, she had taken on an advanced
role as one of the primary members helping
to brainstorm set ideas a week or so before
practice with Steehler and the other officers.

“Once Alex started making the sets, it actu-
ally made it a lot easier because he could visu-
alize where we were going with the practices
and what weineeded to work on,” Sanker said.
“Because he’s outside the water watching us,
whereas we’re in the water doing the practice,
so it’s hard to see what everyone else needs.”

A proactive approach by club members has
helped Panther Swim Club grow as quickly as it
has and bodes well for future longevity.

“One of the things that [Miller] recom-
mended that we do if we want to host our own
meets in the future or want to do another time
trial in the fixture is he told us we should try
and get more familiar with the timing system,”
Steehler said. “So whatl and a few of the other
oﬂicers are doing is taking a class, ‘Pool Opera-
tions/ Event Management,’ that teaches you how
to use the timing system at Trees, and you get
credit for it. I had no idea there was even a class

‘ like that. One of our hopes in the future is to

host our own invitational or host our own dual
meet, but that’s a pretty long-term goal for us,

, so hopefully next yearwe’ll be able to do that.”

Steehler and his peers accomplished this
goal as well: On March 23, the club will host
its own quad meet at Trees Pool.

Suchacollectively willing and independent
attitude has impressed Miller. ‘

“They’re doing it all on their own. On
campus, there areso many organizations, so
‘many groups, that are so loosely organized that
there’s just not a whole lot of structure to it,”
Miller said. “The Panther Swim Club deﬁnitely
has it together, and so I think they should be

. commended on that, and I know that that’s

what drives them because they see the fruits
of their labor paying 0 .” ‘

Looking at what the club has accomplished
in a short period already illustrates just how
driven this group is. ‘

' Now Panther Swim Club wants to become‘
more independent and more recognized on
campus. ' A . 0

“We’re working on getting team suits and
equipment, so we can stop borrowingfrom the
varsity. And starting to get our name out there
like ‘Hey,‘we exist!’ because one of the things

i going from last year to this year was people

came up to us and said, ‘I didn’t know you guys
existed, I didn’t know you were a club,”’ Cinque-

grani said. “So we’_re trying to be more visible.” ‘

Given the relative youth of the organization,
another main goal is to establish the foundation
for longevity.

“What we’re really trying to do is recruit a lot
of people each year. We had a big recruitment
this year [carry over] from last year, so that’s
good,” Cinquegrani added. “Trying to get people
excited about it and getting them to stick with
it instead of being casual about it. Get people
to see it as their club. Find people who are as
passionate about it as we are, so ‘they’re going
to keep it going.” -

To Miller, the quick evolution of the club is a
testament to the work the ofﬁcers have put in.

“Under the leadership of Kevin, those four
have really done a fantastic job from the bottom
up with getting this team going,” Miller said.
“They started it with justavision, not knowing
exactly what it would end up looking like, but a
vision to have a club.” . A

And after all that the club has accomplished

. in such a short amount of time, those involved

are-excited for the future. -
“I’m looking forward to seeing what this
turns into,” McLaren said. i

day,” Zeigler said. “We’re getting used to the
roles we gotta play in a zone. I think at ﬁrst
we weren’t sure about our rotations and staff,
we’re starting to ﬁgure out how we gotta play
the 2-3 and be effective.”

What will play to Pitt’s advantage Satur-
day will be the presence of leading scorer
Tray Woodall, who averages 10.9 points per
game. Woodall missed the majority of Pitt’s
ﬁrst matchup with Marquette after sustain-
ing a concussion from a collision early in the
ﬁrst half.

“I think it’s to our advantage, having him
back. He’s been through the battles before in
the Big East,” Robinson said. “He’s our leader
out there.” I

But as Robinson and the rest of the Pan-
thers know, they still face the same strong

Marquette team that gave the Panthers dif- I

ﬁculty roughly a month ago.

“They still have good guards, good wings.
Their post play is deﬁnitely a key to them
being successful,” Robinson said. “If we stay
in front of them on the perimeter, I think we
can be successful.” _ T

Since Pitt last played Marquette, the Pan-
thers reeled off wins in seven of eight games
and are now a much different team than
the one that fell to Marquette the ﬁrst time
around.‘The difference lies within the team
itself and how it has come together as the
season progressed.

“We have more team chemistry. We’ve had
a lot more practices, a lot more game experi-
ence since the last time we faced Marquette.
I think We’ve gelled a lot more as a team, and
I think we are ready,” Robinson said.

A game like Sat:urday’s is the perfect op-
portunity for Pitt to show just that, as Dixon’s
unit proved by exacting revenge on Cincinnati
in its last game. .

“We feel we’re a better team now than we
were then, but we gotta show that,” Dixon said.

§F8MElEA 

opportunity to play with the best teams in the
country.” ' V

As afreshman, Maggie Sevilla started all 52
games for Pitt last season and ﬁnished second
on the team with eight home runs. Though
only a sophomore, she will be looked upon as a
leaderfor an inexperienced group in the inﬁeld.

“I think it is just important that we come in
here and work, every day counts, as long as we
take it day by day,” the second baseman said.
“If we can put all of that together, we can have
a really good year.”

Carissa Throckmorton, a player who also

started all 52 games last season as afreshman, ,

will make a position change as well, moving
from outﬁeld to third base.

“I think this tournament is really going to
show how well we mesh together. We played re-
ally well together throughout the fall,” Throck-
morton said. “It is going to give us a preview
for how the rest of our season is going to be.”

The Panthers head into the season un-
ranked, but they expect to compete with the top
teams in the Big East this season. One key for
success will be the continued development on
the defensive side, with all four inﬁelders not
having any experience playing with each other.

Assistant coachjen Chamberlin, who is in
charge of ﬁelding and hitting, has conﬁdence
that team members will mature quickly as a

group.

“I think the challenge has been working
on communication, getting them to work to-
gether and come together has been a little bit
challenging,” Chamberlin said. “But the fun-
damental thing is that they are all catching on‘

really quickly, and now we just need them to a

mold together on the ﬁeld.”

Following the Texas A&M tournament, the
Panthers will make trips to Bowling Green, Ky.,
for the Holiday Inn Hilltopper Classic, Kissim—
mee, Fla., for the ESPN Disney Tournament,/P
Tempe, Ariz., for the Diamond Devil Classic
and Fairfax, Va., for the Cherry Blossom Clas-
sic. The Panthers home schedule will begin
March 19, when they take on St. Francis (Pa.)
in a nonconference doubleheader at Vartabe—
dian Field. 3
