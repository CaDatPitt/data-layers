Debate Heads List"
Extensive Schedule

“The forensic program this year
will include extensive intercollegi-
ate debates,” says Roy H. Umble,
who succeeds Charles W. Lomas,
as coach for the varsity debating
squad this year.

Receiving his A.B. degree in 1935
from Goshen college, Mr. Umble
directed debating in South Bend,
Ind., in 1937.

This past summer he attended
the Northwestern School of Speech,
where he received his M.A. degree.
While majoring there in debate,
rhetoric, and public speaking, he
was a colleague of Mr. Lomas.

He also attended Wabash college
and is a member of Beta Theta Phi
social fraternity.

“I got my start in debating from
my father who is a debate coach
himself,” says Mr. Umble, who is
also interested in parliamentary
procedure in relation to campus
student bodies. An effort will be
made to contact many high schools
for demonstration debates, and for
debates with the respective school
teams.

The new coach was particularly
impressed by the large turnout of
freshmen for debating at the Druid
smoker this past Wednesday eve-
ning. A meeting for freshmen will
be held today, at 2:30 o'clock, in
1617 Cathedral, where the varsity
will also meet at 3:30 o'clock.

One of the tentative subjects for
discussion this year by both the
varsity and freshman squads is,
“Resolved: United States and Great
Britain should form an alliance."

Swedish Room Group
Will Present Movies

Full color movies showing the
grandeur of Scandinavia, and King
Gustav's 80th birthday celebration
in Stockholm, are to be shown on
Friday evening, October 7, in Car-
negie music hall, for the beneﬁt of
the Swedish Room.

There will be music and native
costumes of the Scandinavian coun-
tries, in addition to the feature
ﬁlms of the evening. The ﬁlms take
the audience on a 15,000 mile jour-
ney through Sweden, Denmark,
Finland, Lapland, and Norway,
with stops in Copenhagen and
Stockholm.

Wing Gives Talk

Hugh A. Wing, instructor in
English, was guest speaker and
discussion leader at the opening
meeting of the American Avenue
Parent-Teacher association held
last night.

Mr. Wing discussed the subject,
“The State of Pennsylvania.”

Dean Will Speak

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Adminis-
tration, will speak at a meeting of
the Pittsburgh chapter of the Na-
tional Association of Cost Ac-
countants, tomorrow evening in the
Roosevelt hotel.

 

Fraternity Book
Appears Today

The 1938-39 Fraternity Handbook
appears on campus today when it
will be distributed in freshmen
orientation classes, according to
Robert R. Corley, assistant dean of
men.

Distribution will be completed
when the balance of the orientation
classes meet on Thursday. Former-
ly this book, explaining fraternities
as a group and individually, was
given freshmen during freshman
week at the annual banquet, but the
plan this year is believed to assure
a larger percentage of readers and
better distribution.

Mr. Corley announced that the
ﬁrst meeting of Interfraternity
Council has been called for tonight
in the Theta Chi house by William
Stirling, BA39, president.

 

Hostess Resumes
Wednesday Teas

Starting October 5, tea will be
served every Wednesday afternoon
in the Commons Room from 3 to
5 o'clock to students, faculty, and
anyone else who cares to come
down to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Attendants for these afternoons
will be freshmen girls from the
orientation classes. A different class
will serve each week.

From 600 to 800 students were
present at each of these teas last
year, according to Mrs. J. K. Miller,
hostess of the Commons Room.
Mrs. Miller began the custom last
fall. At that time Monday was
picked, but because of the shift of
the activities hour, Wednesday has
replaced it as the weekly date.

Mrs. Miller added that possibly a
musical program may be arranged
for these afternoons. However, stu-
dents in classes held during that
time on the three floors surround-
ing the Commons Room must be
considered ﬁrst. As yet, nothing
deﬁnite can be promised.

 

Debating Association

Announces New Plans

The Women's Debating Associa-
tion is now located in a new office,
1212 Cathedral, with its new coach,

ﬁt the interests of the audiences.

Miss McMurray, the new coach,
has arranged conference hours on
Tuesdays at 1:30 o'clock and on
Thursdays at 8:30 o'clock to com-
ply with the schedules of the group.

THE PITT NEWS

Sutherland Men Overwhelm
.West Virgt:nia’s Eleven, 19-0

Goldberg, Daddio 
Head Pitt Offense A

Foreadvised from all reliable
sources that their first Saturday
afternoon recitation would be as
difficult to master as any ﬁnal ex-
amination, Dr. Sutherland’s foot-
ball class spent many anxious prep-
ping moments. It was therefore
somewhat of a surprise to the foot-
ball Panthers when the first of
their weekly quizzes turned out to
be little different than the usal late
September, opening day problems.

Of course the Mountaineer was
no snap course. He offered no
chance for an Ohio Wesleyan romp
—not exactly. But he was not much
harder to solve than W&J and
Waynesburg have been in times
gone past.

Maybe it was partially because
the Panthers had studied for a
hard game and were prepared for
anything that they made the alleg-
edly capable West Virginia look as
impotent as Papa Yokum instead
of L’l Abners as word had it they
were.

MOUNTAINEERS PRIMED

Maybe West Virginia, who had
spent almost two months preparing
for this contest, had been reading
the wrong books. Whatever it was,
the 19-0 Pitt victory could have
been considerably more plentiful in
the scoring way if the Panthers
hadn't been so ineffectual on cer-
tain counts, themselves. Notably
quarterbacking and d o w n f i e 1 d
blocking.

Pitt scored three times, all points
being made from inside the two-
yard line. Goldberg muscled
through when the count was fourth
down and two yards to go in the
second quarter. Goldberg went over
shortly after the second half be-
gan on the same kind of a play
from the same position of the field,
a head-down drive through guard.

SOPHOMORE SCORES

Pitt's ﬁnal score was made by
sophomore Joe Rettinger, who
picked up a Peace fumble in the
air and ran around the scrimmage
pile-up late in the third quarter.

Statistically, as well as by every
other measurement method, the
game was all Pitt. There were 15
ﬁrst downs for Pitt against 2 for
the Mountaineers.

On the opening scrimmage play
of the game Stebbins glided
through the Mountaineer line for
about 45 yards and from then on it
was just like any season inaugural
for the Panthers. This immediate
ground pick-up probably did a
whole lot to destroy the Mountain-
eer potency as it played havoc with
its morale.

PITT SHOWS DRIVE

Pitt displayed raw power. And
let not the Mountaineers be under-
estimated, even though their per-
formance was disappointing. The
way Pitt played was just as much
responsible for the West Virginia
appearance.

It was evident to certain observ-
ers, at least this one, that the
Mountaineers were rather poorly
coached. They charged poorly, their
offense was hardly adapted to the
abilities of their backfield, they
telegraphed a great proportion of
their plays to the Panthers, and
their backs, particularly widely-
heralded Clark, had no effective
drive. All in all, the Mountaineers
were more impressive last year.

DADDIO STARS

For Pitt, despite expected Sep-
tember errors, there was much_
brilliance. Stebbins looked like the ;
great running back that he is.
Goldberg was still the All-Amer-
ican Goldberg, even though he is
now a fullback. Peace was a grace-
ful running back, highly effective
as an offensive instrument.

Daddio’s linemanship was superb.
Lezouski and Klein played ball
that ranked in the same class. ‘

The one problem, center, is still
a problem. There would have been
one, and possibly three, more
touchdowns if Dannies could geti
downﬁeld and do his assigned;
blocking there.

Potts Calls For Intramural Team

Managers, Throws Open Gym Doors

First Competitioni

Begins October 6

With the first competition be-
ginning on October 6, the fall in-
tramural athletics program contin-
ues to move right along with
Jimmy Potts at the helm.

Most important issue just now is
the question of managers. All team
managers and men interested in
becoming either Senior manager or
one of the sport managers should
report at the Trees Gymnasium
floor on September 29 at 4:30 o’-
clock.

At the meeting team managers
will receive entry blanks and full
instructions for entering a team in
the tournament. Men wishing -to
become sport managers or Senior
manager will enter their names for
consideration.

These managers will be selected
on the basis of initiative, interest,
responsibility, and scholastic abil-
ity. Final choices will be announced
several days after the meeting.

Team managers must have entry
blanks containing complete lists of
their teams in NO LATER THAN
OCTOBER 5. All entries received
after that date will not be accepted.

All University men will be inter-
ested in the announcement that
any male Pitt student may use the
facilities of the Athletic Depa.rt-
ment regardless of whether or not
he is entered in the intramural pro-
gram if he pays a fee of $1.00 per
semester. This does not include
those men registered in the Fresh-
men Sports Program.

The privileges afforded by the
payment of this fee are: use of a
locker and towel, towel laundry
service, use of the swimming pool,
use of the tennis courts, use of the
handball courts, and use of sports
equipment. The fee is paid through
the purchase of a metal check at
the University Book Store, the
check being presented at Trees
Gym by the student when he wish-
es to make use of these privileges.

A slight revision of the fall in-
tramural program has resulted in
the elimination of speedball from
the list of sports. Swimming and
handball tournaments will take
place only if there is sufficient

Oakland Churches
Hold Student Night

Vaudeville skits and social games
are included on the program of the
Inter-Sectarian Inter-Campus Re-
ception Thursday evening at 8
o’clock in the YM-YWHA auditor-
ium, Belleﬁeld St. University stu-
dents are invited.

Students of all ﬁve Pittsburgh
universities and colleges will par-
ticipate in the program of the re-
ception, which is sponsored by
churches of all denominations in
the Oakland district.

Groups from the ﬁve Pittsburgh
schools will vie in presenting
vaudeville skits. Speaker of the
evening is Rev. Fr. Paul J. Rock,
Catholic chaplain to University
students.

Refreshments will be served at
the conclusion of the evening’s
program.

student interest. The other sports
deﬁnitely included in the program
are as follows:

TOUCH FOOTBALL

The touch football tournament
will be run off in double elimina-
tion ﬂights of eight teams each.
Each team will be composed of
nine men, special rules being de-
vised to cover the change in the

number of men on a team. Com-
petition will begin October 12 with
teams being arranged in the fol-
lowing classes: fraternity, school,
independent.

HORSESHOE PITCHING

There will be an All-Campus
tournament of doubles teams, any
two students in the University be-
ing allowed to enter as a team.
Teams will be classiﬁed according
to the results of their first two
matches, all later competition be-
ing against teams of approximately
the same ability. Competition be-
gins October 6.

SOCCER

The schedule will comprise single
elimination ﬂights of eight teams
each with a team consisting of

eleven men. Competition will begin
October 7.
TENNIS

Tennis will be conducted on the
same basis as horseshoes with an
All-Campus tournament of doubles
team, the teams being classiﬁed for
later play on the results of their
ﬁrst two matches. Competition
starts October 7.

(‘ROSS COUNTRY

The University Championship
race will be run over a mile and
ﬁve eighths course in Schenley
Park on November 16 to 5 P.M.
Registration for the meet will close
November 4.

Mid -West J aunts Feature
Cross - Country Schedule

“Purdue will beat us; our pros- ’

pects are poor; and the team is an
unknown quantity” were the ob-
servations of Coach Carl Olson
concerning the 1938 version of the
Panther cross country team which
opens the season next Saturday at
Purdue.

Last time Coach Olson referred
to the pitiful prospects of one of
his teams, that team, his 1938 mile
relay quartet, ran oﬂ’ with the Na-
tional Relay title. The Pitt cross-
country team, then, should be one
of the best in history.

Pitt beat the Boilermaker har-
riers quite decisively last year on
the Schenley course. However, Pur-
due will be on homegrounds this
time and the advantages of the
home course should pay dividends
on the Purdue side of the ledger.

The Olsonmen are a veteran ag-
gregation supplemented by a crew
of sophomores that won the Na-
tional IC4A as freshmen. Al B011-l
langer, George McCabe, Al McKee,
Walter Sterner, and Bill Nurmi
are the second year men who are
expected to press the veterans.

Al Zamborski, Casimir Kopec,
Ben Kopec, and Bob Cogswell will
be back to wind over hill and dale.
Al Boulanger and George McCabe
may run their way into the num-
ber one or two positions before the
season runs out. At the present Al
Zamborski and Casmir Kopec hold
down the number one and two
spots, and will continue in these
for the ﬁrst few meets.

While taking all meets in stride,

the Panthers will point for the
Michigan State meet at Michigan
late in October and the Penn State
clash on the Schenley course early
in November. The boys from Mich-
igan are the defending IC4A
Champs and a victory over this
outﬁt will put the Panthers in the
van of the country’s harriers.

High point number two will be
the meet with the Nittany Lion
boys. The Staters were the only
outﬁt to gain a victory over last
year’s team. State will be here with
essentially the same team that beat
Pitt quite decisively a year ago.

The Panthers will race for Na-
tional honors late in November at
the National Collegiate meet in
Lansing Michigan. The Michigan
and Penn State meets will be a
preview of what can be expected
from the Pitt Harriers at the Na-
tional Collegiates.

FRESHMEN DEBATERS

All freshmen interested in debat-
ing will meet today, at 2:30 o’clock,
in 1617 Cathedral. Varsity debaters
will also meet today at 3:30 o’clock.

PITT PLAYERS

Pitt Players will hold try-outs‘

in 226 Cathedral from 3 to 5 to-
day, according to Earl Riley, C39,
President.

Tomorrow at 3:30 in 226 Cathe-

plans for the coming season.

Miss Amos Makes

Housing Survey

College graduates, according to Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women, need housing facilities to :’it
their tastes and needs.

“Two classes, young college graduates and retired
business men and women, ﬁnd it particularly diffi-
cult to live under the conditions now available,”
Dean Amos explained. “The salaries obtained by
young people getting started in business are not
sufficient to allow them to live in the manner they
deserve if 40 per cent must be used for rent.”

In an article published ﬁrst in the Real Estate
Record and later in the Architectural Record, Miss
Amos presented the results of her survey made of
the housing facilities in Pittsburgh for moderately
salaried people.

There are only two types of residences in Pitts-
burgh for women of this group, according to Dean
Amos. One is the hall bedroom, “which is totally un-
livable,” she says, and the other is the $200-a-month
apartment.

Modern apartment hotels with large, airy rooms,
private baths, and small butler pantries would an-
swer the needs for the young man or woman starting
in business much better than a building with small
rooms and an expensive foyer.

“There are several parts of Oakland that could
be torn down to provide space for a building of the
type the survey ﬁnds is wanted. But, of course,
there is the eternal problem of ﬁnding some one to
ﬁnance such a plan.”

Prior to 1929, Dean Amos was a member of :1
women's committee which studied the housing prob-
lem with relation to the women and professional
group. The activities of the committee were sus-
pended as the result of economic conditions.

At present, Miss Amos is making a study of what
young college graduates desire in housing. In the
survey she is considering only those who have grad-
uated since 1934 in order to obtain young people's
ideas on conditions under which they prefer to live.

Poland Has Case
Of War Nerves

Ruttencutter Reviews European

Scene After Six-Weeks Tour

Poland is on the spot, believes Robert Ruttencut-
ter, C39, who recently returned from a six weeks’
stay in that country.

Although Bob, who visited Poland on a scholar-
ship from the Kosciuzko Foundation of New York,
left for a tour of the Scandinavian countries before
the present crisis developed, he saw evidences of the
Polish war jitters.

These consisted of heavy and partially uncoii-
cealed arming. Living at the ﬂying ﬁeld in Warsaw,
Ruttencutter saw 3,000 conscripts march to and from
the airport, where they were being trained for serv-
ice with the air force. This, plus the presence of
army tanks in the city streets and of canvas covered
guns on ﬂatcars in the railroad sidings created an
ominous setting.

Despite these preparations, Bob believes “Poland
is not in a position, geographically or economically,
to oppose either Germany or Russia. The Poles are
trying to build up the country and to arm at the
same time. They aren‘t doing either too well. Per-
sonally, I don’t think they would have a chance
against the larger nations around them.”

The growing tension, which was apparent at the
time of Ruttencutter’s departure, did not arouse the
people beyond their usual feeling of uneasiness. This
calm was fostered by the Polish press which is
“under the supposedly democratic government’s su-
pervision.”

The press plays an important part not only in
keeping the calm but conversely enough, also in
stimulating the feeling of nationalism. Citing an ex-
ample, Bob told of Colonel Lindbergh’s recent stop-
over at Warsaw on his way to Russia.

“Because any Russian reference has a bad con-
notation in Poland and because the government
seemingly wants to prevent anything but national
hero-warship, Lindbergh’s pictures in the papers
were mutilated so that he could not be recognized
by the Polish people.”

After the “under seige” appearance of Poland,
the visit to the Scandinavian countries was a relief,
Bob maintained, adding that “these nations, not so
highly militarized, have a much higher standard of
living than is found elsewhere on the continent.”

Campus-at-Large

After 1910--What? . . .

Before the year 1910, students at the University
of Kentucky were summoned to class by a bugler.
He stood on a little knoll and blew. The bugler was
later replaced by a steam whistle, attached to a
boiler; they now have bells at the U. of K.

Physical Culture Only Way Out

Colorado U. is still bragging about Whizzer White,
now of the Pirate Pros. The Whizzer had a straight
A average for four years, we understand, and was
known to study calculus when stretched out on a
rubdown table between halves.

Hot Sidewalks . . .

That extra touch has been added at Oklahoma A.
& M. where engineers got the bright idea of laying
their pipes from a steam-heating plant underneath
the sidewalks. The steam heat keeps the sidewalks
free of ice and slush in the winter.

Being Sick Cheap . . .

West Virginia University has arranged a group
hospitalization plan for its students, whereby the
payment of a fee of ﬁfty cents insures the student
of hospital care up to the amount of one hundred
dollars, including a nurse.

Another Quota System . . .

The University of Washington initiated a course
in something or other for parents. The course be-
came so frequented that it is now open to the parents
of university freshmen——nobody else.

You Said It!

WELL, THAT’S THAT
Senator Carter Glass (D. Va.) in recent address:

“A liberal is a man who is willing to spend some 

one else’s money. A conservative is a man of good
sense.” g * *

DIPLOMATIC VICTORY
Howard Brubaker, in New Yorker column:

“Mr. Chamberlain's aggressive diplomacy has
forced Franco to make an important concession.
The Rebel chief agrees not to sink any more
British ships if they will stay away from there.”

RADIO ON TAP

“Radio? I have never broadcast. Too much like
hot and cold water taps the listener can turn on
