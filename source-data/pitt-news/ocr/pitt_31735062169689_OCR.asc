Faculty’s ROTC Vote Ma

Officials
Rap Vote

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News
'.S'¢'v I-ftlitnrizll. I’u}._{(' -I)

The debate over the accred-
itation of ROTC is over,‘but
the issue is raging in Wash-
ington, Harrisburg and Gate-
way Center, reliable sources

i told The Pitt News.
 The pressure is so great, the

sources say, that the adminis-
tration is being put into an
awkward position. In this sit-

uation, it will benecessary for '

the administration to retain
ROTC credit in some way,
shape or form.

A second University spokes- .

man told The Pitt News Tues-
day that - the‘ administration
had until September to imple-
ment the ROTC decision. . The

_ spokesman also reported that only’

ment the ROTC decision. The

a spokesman also reported that only

15 per cent of the faculty voted
in Tuesday's ROTC vote. and that
instructors were allowed to vote.
This, he said, seeminly, pointed
to the illegally of the vote.

The spokesman added that a
compromise provision maybe
“worked out” allowing for the fu-
ture re-adoption of ROTC credit.
After traveling to Washington,
D. C., University Military Cor-

1 Vﬁfordinator Richard Rose and For-

mer Defense Department Offi-
cial Sol Horowitz reported that
the faculty at MIT abolished
ROTC. The situation there they
reported was alleviated when the
faculty overhauled the program
and made it academically accept-
able. Such a proposal may be at-
tempted at the University.

The Pitt News also learned ear-
ly Thursday morning that a spe-
cial meeting was held Wednes-
day at 3 p.m. in the office of Uni-

percentage of the, total faculty

that attended the meeting, and
said that he was not quite sure of
the scheduled time of the meet-

Dr. Peake reportedly told the

group of ROTC representatives,

the reason that so few of the fac-

 Mayor’s ‘Tax’ Unsound-—-Posvar 
    Tuition Hike May Result
 if Proposals Approve

by GEORGE LIES
.. , Associate Editor
Chancellor Wesley Posvar made it very apparent late Wed-
nesday afternoon that he will indeed oppose Pittsburgh Mayor

Joseph M. Barr’s tax proposals on institutions which provide "
_ “services delivered to the public.” .

He called the tax proposal, which would result in a state, 1 .“’_
tuition hike, “an unsound proposal.” And said he planned to; ._ 

make his “views on lstrongterms to city authorities, and argue
on practical and political grounds the principle of the tax. ”~ ’

Mayor Barr, who is seeking
to pull the city government
out of its financial-doldrums,
had asked for a‘ six mill tax on in-
stitutions such C as, universities.
hospitals, and other institutions

which provide a_public service.

Chancellor Posvar called it “in
effect, a tax on students for tui-
tion and housing and board.” He
said other University areas would
also be affected by the tax.

“It islan unwise, tax because it
consists of one public institution
getting revenue from another in-
stitution that provides services to
the public,” Dr. Posvar told The‘
Pitt News Wednesday.

“It can be compared to a dog
chasing its tail, and catching it,”
he said.

‘‘In the long run, nothing can

_be gained by this kind of arrange-

ment. But it does present omin-
ous implications,” he added. I

By “ominous implications,”
Dr. Posvar said the tax could
“open doors” to further taxation
upon these institutions.

‘ To the student, the mayor’s’

proposals would mean a $3 hike
on state tuition, and a $9 hike on

out-of-state tuition. Roomandr

board,
hiked $6.

subsequently, would be

But, according to Dr. Posvar,
the city could raise the proposed
tax ‘rate, in the near future, and
this would result in an another

hike in tuition ‘and room and. « '

board rates.

Dr. Posvar said he has con? ‘ '

tacted several University econ-
omists, one of which he named

as Professor Mark Perlman, to . .

“develop a wider base” to fight

.the principle of the tax proposal.‘ ‘

Also, “in taling with the Uni-
versity Council, we feel that it is
strongly possible that the tax
would not be legal in any case,”
he said. State laws provide for
non-profit institution immunity
to such taxes.

“We must appreciate this very,
serious imbalance on the basis of

tax revenue in which cities are _

severely deprived of tax income,”
he continued.

Dr. Posvar said “a greater L‘.

equality must be established” on

the distribution of tax_ incomes. '

“For this reason, the mayor and
city council have a very serious
problem which we must all«sym-
pathize.” ‘

“I would be glad to assist"
them, along with my colleagues, .
in Searching for alternatives,’,’ Dr.
Posvar said.

“When I was in graduate school, I wanted
to make sure I’d get to use what I was learn-

’ ing. That’s why I went into marketing at IBM,.’’

says John Houlihan.

John earned his MBA in 1966. He now sells
IBM computers to mutual funds, banks and
other financial institutions.

“lt’s a management consulting job,” he

says. “The reason is, computers affect nearly
every area of a business. I get involved

with a customer’s accounting, finance, and
marketing. Which means I have to know
something about each of these areas. So I’m
constantly using the broad scope of knowl-
edge I picked up in graduate school.”

Working at the top .
Another management consulting aspect of
John’s job is the level of people he deals with.
“Most of the time,” he says, ‘‘I work with vice-

presidents and the data processing manager.
But I also have to deal with the president
because he’s often the only one who can give
final approval. I

“And when you’re working with people on
that level, you need the management tools
you get in graduate school. If a customer
starts talking about a regression analysis, I
can stay with him. Or, I might get involved in a
linearprogramming study to determine the
optimum stock mix for a portfolio. Believe me,
getting an MBA was worth the extra effort.”

Career areas for MBA’s

Marketing is only one of several areas for
MBA’s at IBM. Others include financeand
engineering. MBA’s in finance can work in
Financial Planning and Control, Financial
Analysis, Accounting, and Information
S.ystems. In engineering, MBA’s work mainly

Whatever area you choose, we think you’ll
agree with John: “Getting my MBA was
worth the extra effort.”

Cheryl Yon and a friend,

to go through medical school.‘ 
knew the army will put you

validity of the faculty vote.

Our King?

There are a number of curious conditions surrounding the .
so called “conclusive” vote of thefaculty to abolish ROTC
. credit. It seems that some people at the University are not

willing to accept the verdict.

A number oc harges have been made that attempt to ne-
gate the validity of the faculty’s decision on ROTC. Some
persons say that the instructors at the faculty meeting did
not have the right to vote. But the faculty of the College
'-—- a body with no set by-laws or procedural outlines—- passed
a resolution allowing the eight instructors present to vote

A statement voiced pointing to the fact that only 15 per-
cent of the faculty were present at the meeting. The Pitt
News learned that 15 percent of the total faculty was pre-
sent, but that this figure represents 42 percent of the faculty
of the College of Arts and Sciences. Aside from this, Dean
Halliday sent out information concerning the proposed meet-
ing of the faculty some three weeks ago. The meeting was
’ well publicized.

The most disturbing aspect of this run around, how-

ever is that the vote of faculty is seemingly inconclusive.
.- .It is disturving to discover that many individuals in the ad-
- ministration deem this faculty affair with a most suspicious
eye. We are certain the reason for‘ this suspicion results
from the great pressure that is being put on the adminis-
tration — especially Dr. Posvar — to reinstate ROTC credit.
And it seems that Dr. Posvar is the man who must decide

But isn’t it somewhat odd that the validity of the ROTC
vote is being challengedafter the faculty decided to abolish
ROTC credit. And isn’t it somewhat odd that members of the
‘administration are suddenly claiming that a 106 to 84 vote-
a legitimate tally — does not represent the views of those
faculty members who thought their absence was a vote for

Dr. Posvar has a difficult decision to make. He can abide
by the faculty vote, or he can drag this thing out for such a

long time that the issue will eventually die a silent “swept
under the carpet” death. We think Dr. Posvar owes the
University community a statement of his intent. We think
"Dr. Posvar should clarify his position and thoughts on the

If Dr. Posvar does decide that the faculty vote was in-
conclusive, the Chancellor of this University will achieve a
new status —- he will become our king. ’

Want To Talk It Over?

 

By GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Ruthy said goodbye and hung-up the phone.
and all I could remember was her saying. “It was
good to talk to you. I feel better.“

That's when I thought of the many students at
this school who have problems but the only thing
they do is worry about them. They feel there is no
one to explain "things" to, V
and worse yet, they feel no
one will understand their
problems.

Then I thought of Dr.
Gallagher of the Counsel-
ing Center. In his small
way of just being able to
sit and listen to the prob-
lems of students. he has
helped many find them-
selves or at least he has
put them on the right
track. But yet his daily
appointment schedule
is never quite filled, and sometimes, he feels his
time is being wasted when he is not speaking with a
student who he might be able to help.

“STUDENTS DON’T want to come up here,"
he has said, his New England accent notwithstand-
ing. “Some don't even know were here, and that
were available to talk. Others are afraid that their
friends wi_l_l think of them as 'wierd' or ‘odd’ if they

"It'll be on the 16th and in this

come here." ,

"But the kids who come here are normal per-
sons. They feel that something is bothering them.
and they want to do something about it." Dr. Gal-
lagher says." "Ironically. the other ones who feel
they have a problem. and who don't do’ anything
about it are the ones who lose out."

"Many of the kids who come here have very
creative minds. There is one girl who I look for-
ward to seeing because she just glows with human-
ism.“ he has said. "A few girls and one guy. who are
getting married soon have come to see me. and they
all have told me that our sessions have helped
them."

“BUT OUR PROBLEM,” he says, “is reaching
the kids who don't know about us. and the kids who
are afraid to come up to.see us. We‘re trying to build
the department. but we cant really go around pub-
licizing ourselves-r Becaiisebthen we would get too
much of an overflow.We’d have too many insincere
people who think were _trying to psychoanalyze
them.“

"Those people we can do without. We want kids
who want to help themselves," Dr. Gallagher has
said.

Another type of student Dr. Gallagher would
like to reach is the one who makes fun of a room-
mate or classmate who visits the Counseling Cen-
ter. It seems very apparent that this type of stu-

dent is the one who needs help. He _is the one who ‘

really has the sick mind.

trying to hurry and finish up
the courses. Most of them us-
ually set aside the last couple of
lectures for general class dis-
cussion and any questions which
the students might have. I find
this procedure to be sort of worth-
less. ~ ‘ ‘

For example. I went to one of
these wind-up sessions today.
Approximately one-third of the

"It will be cumulative.“

by RUTH ZAPLIN
Staff News Writer

A discussion initiated by one of my professors,

brought out some astute observations and concrete
suggestions concerning course procedures at this
University.

The observations consisted of the following. The
students at this University are forced to carry too
many credits. Because most students carry 15 cre-
dits or five courses per trimester. the time devoted
to study must be divided up rather neatly. "Fair
time" must be given to each subject.

IN MOST CA’SES, a student struggling under
the burden of five courses is forced to "concede“
at least one of these courses. This means that the
student will study just enough to get a C. and then
he can devote more time to his other four courses.
A course that is conceded is usually one that re-
quares the student to just spit back on an exam what
is in the class notes and in the text. No thinking is
required.

If a student has carefully selected the course
that heconcedes. then successful completion of
the work will require about six or seven hours time
out of the whole trimester. _

THERE IS ALSO an effect on the professor if

« his students are forced to cope with too many sub-
jects at one time. Professors feel that they are in
competition with one another. In a way. they are vy-
ing for the students time. They want" their students
to give adequate time to_.their,subjects. Obviously.

"Well. yes, I could explain all that

dent must contend with so many credits.

The student, on the other hand. in his earnest pur-

_ suit of knowledge iaheml) will _not..be able .to.-
spend thatmuch time on subjects heparticularly

likes. There is no time available to do an extra
thorough job.

Fortunately. there are solutions to the dilemma
and it.doesn‘t include conceding a course. Other Uni-.
versities and colleges have done it. so why not us‘?

If we must maintain the trimester system. the
seven and a half week» sessions in the summer
should be continued for the fall and winter terms.
A student would have the option of taking three
courses a ‘[term" but no less than two courses. In
this way. the student would have the opportunity
all year round to devote his full attention to two or

"three courses. His chances of comprehending the

courses he takes. increases.

ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE would be changing
the trimester system to a quarter system. A student
would be required to take two or three courses a
quarter. Instead of seven and a half weeks per term.
the quarter system would alot approximately ten
weeks for the concentrated pursuit of two or three
subjects. a *

By decreasing the creditload of each student.
less course will end up being conceded and the
chance of slighting professors will also decrease.
Chances of the student devoting "enought" time to

a particular subject will increase. resulting. hope-

fully. in more knowledgeable students and fewer

wasted courses. < A  ,

It’s Been ‘Open Season’ On SDS

It is difficult to accept a bias so
marked. a judgment so faulty and
an understanding so limited as to
have produced Fridays editorial.
Yet it has been open season on
SDS since the beginning of the
year and standards of journalism
often have been secondary to get-
ting another blow in at the hated
group.

SDS is not brutal nor is it sadis-
tic and we are outraged by bru-
tality. We neither encourage nor
wish to convert anyone on the ba-
sis of bloodied heads.

As to having no "program" that
after all seems to be the hardest
thing for people to understand.
We are_ not leaders and led and
we are not dupes. We are people
united in working and groping to-
gether toward solutions. The
movement is not a recipe with so
many cups of this andlteaspoons
of that; it is a poem and unfolds
organically.

What we share is a common
feeling — a feeling for the dig-
nity‘ of man and we share also a
frustration that man exploits his
fellow man and does not realize
his potential. We do not have

SDS Politics
Best ‘Mess"

Editor. The Pitt News:

I should like to reply to some al-
legations of the disorganization of
SDS contained in Paul Stoller‘s
column in a recent edition. -

Yes we are disorganized. But
our common political and social
commitments far outweigh our
procedural difficulties.

Our present lack of unity is in
the nature of birth pangs, ‘and

reflects the wide ideological di- '

versity among our many mem-
bers. Unlike our present admin-
istration, we will not declare war
until all other means have failed,
or until all members have been
consulted.

However, at our last meeting,
a movie of Columbia was shown,
and it was received with remark-
able enthusiasm. Our meeting
ended with a grand sense of pur-

. pose.

For those who would claim that
SDS would be revolutionary un-
der any system, no matter how
wide the possibilities for expres-
sion of discontent, iwe .reply -that
the question is totally irrelevant.

What our members could be’

does not bear upon what we are.
Our society does not channel our
discontent; it is to that extent
undemocratic, and by its own
principles should be overthrown.

SIDS To ‘Take Any Measures To . .

Editor, Pitt News:

There are rumblings of SDS.
It is frightening, for -a number
of semi-valid reasons; it is Co-
lumbia, it was Berkeley, Drugs,
Castro . . . Semi-valid reasons
are debatable, and are valid from
only one point of view.

On the level of specifics rath-
er than of phobias, SDS wants rev-
olution, and what does that mean
to you? A black man ‘next door,
Communist pseudo—intellectuals
at the university?

We mean sanity, we believe;
Morals before Ma jorities.

We would like to clarify certain
issues which have been raised in
your columns, editorials, and pic-
torials in recent editions concern-
ing Students for a Democratic So-
ciety. Despite the procedural
differences, the many members
of our organizationshare a com-
mon commitment to immediate
socio-political change, in this uni-
versity and on the national and
international levels.

Unlike all other organizations
on this campus, SDS" will take any
means necessary to achieve its
ends. A superficial glance might
make us appear “undemocratic:

there are othc: reasons for low-
ering the voting age. _
The educational level of our
‘young people isincreasing each
_ye_ar. They know more about pol-
itics and government than their
counterparts of a few decades
ago. Senator Everett Dirksen stated
recently. "I believe 18-year olds
are now better educated and mo e
responsible than eve: before."

Many schools hold mock elec-
tions. Issues are discussed in social
studies classes and. for the most
part. students take the elections
seriously. They get into the habit
of voting. A thr eeyear waiting pe-
riod may cause them to lose in-
terest. ,

Representative William Moor.-
head. who has introduced a bill
to lower the voting age to 18. has
stated that the: e isdanger that dur-
ing a three year wait to vote their
interest in politics and their de-
sire to vote may subside perman-
ently. .

The idea to lower the voting age
is not new. Georgia in 1943. was
the first State in the Union to al-
low 18-year olds the right to vote.
Since then Kentucky has lowered’
the voting age to 18: it is 19 in
Alaska and 20 in Hawaii. P: esident
Eisenhower endorsed it in his State
of the Union Message in 1954
and the Senate came within 5 votes
of approving it that year.

It is again gaining the attention
of law makers. The cause is back-
ed by an impressive list of senato: 5.
House members and governo: s
including leaders of both parties.

John Bailey, Chairman _of the
National Committee
stated, ‘lWe should do everything
to promote ratification
of the Constitutional amendment
that would grant all people over
the age of T8 the right to vote."

Levenson Finally Gets Praise

Dear Mr. Leven_son.

I read your column in The Pitt
News of the 8th. and ‘I was real-
ly impressed. I'm a sophomore at
Pitt in Johnstown «which is not
the most flattering way of intro-
ducing myself—but neithe: would
the fact that I've beenin the mili-
ta y. I was given a very quiet

administrative discharge for be-'

ing “unsuitable" due to my atti-
tude on the war and some other is-
sues.

At any rate. I though! a lit-
tle congratulations were due on
your column. Lenny Bru--e used
to do a routine where he said that
he'd much rather show kids skin
flicks than T\' westerns or war
movies. And it's the truth. Our
myopic morality insists on focus-

’ing on individual “sins" while it
blesses the polite. well-organized
muader machine.,It makes little

kids feel that sex is dirty but kill-'

ing (so long as 436 men in Wash-
ington say it’s O.K. is glorious.
That‘s real obscenity.

30.000 Amezicans and maybe
500.000 Vietnamese are dead and
more will die to save our collec-
tive face: 5 million acres of land
has been defoliated. and a fifth
of the population are official refu-
gees: a full tenth of the U.S. popu-
lation and a quarter of the world's
suffer gross malnutrition while we
spend $80 billion f0! war and $2
billion on pover ty programs.

Senator Eastland gets $13.161
a month subsidy for his planta-
tion. which is equivalent to what
1.462 dependent children get a
month in Mississippi: the co-
ne guocery store is taxed to
death. while corporate taxes hit
the fantastic heights of 9‘. — if
they. get that high: the Kerner
Commission warns of dire things
to come and the President po-
litel_v thanks them and files it

away. This is obscenity. Words

. are just sounds or blobs of ink.

and the “obscenity" isn‘t in them.
it's in the mind of the listener‘.

When the smog hovering over our cities
The dark hunger haunting our tenements
The darker crime stalking our streets
is remembered. I

However History describes our era
We hope it will also

be remembered-

As the time when a young girl's heart
Beat a moment of life into a dying man. . .
As the time when primitive peoples
Leaped across centuries of progress

To take their place at

The World conference table . . .

As the time when Man first struggled to
Close the gap between the-’ I’ ‘

The visitor was George B,

ed‘on education. and vice presi-
dentvof California's Esalen Insti-

to ecstasy. Thus. his Education
and_ Ecstasy is a product of thor-

the "unity of life" that John Dew-

seeks a process which would al-

measure of the human potential

enormity of their time. Today, all

tles is at least one of the better al-.

bums. There is little here to re-
mind us of the musical acrobatics
of Sgt. Pepper’s or Magical Mys-

a marked return to the roots of it
all. Found here is a ‘lot of that

which so characterized the begin-

are drawn from and play upon
various stages in th e develop-

lengthy trip to nostalgia. T h e

tantalize any musical gourmet.
But such lofty kudos is not en-

tirelyg fitting. Although the Bea-
tles try rather courageously to
weave a magical tapestry of sound
one cannot help but notice where
the colors fade and the. fabric is
torn. Even the most skilled crafts-
man cam spread himself a little
too thin and, though talent is elas-
tic. continuous stretching leads to
distorted shape.

It seems that the Beatles just

forgotten, especially after such
memorable occasions as “Back in
the U.S.S.R.,” a take off on Chuck
Berry and the Beach Boys; the
contagious “sing it all together”
glow of “Oh La Di, Oh La Da”
and the strong innuendos of
“Happiness is a Warm Gun.”

From the second side on, the
rest of the material never quite
equals the infectiousness of that
first side. Probably the fault lies

- in the arragnementof the album

as a whole. Too many of the me-
diocre songs are placed one right
after the other which tends to en-
courage boredom. The s e c o n d
side really doesn’t begin to move
until one reaches George Harri-
son’s “Piggies.” The high point»
is “Rocky Raccoon." a country
and western ballad with an Eng-

. lish accent. “Piggies" is marvel-

ous for its child—like mirth and
playground lyrics. But before one
gets this far on the second side
one must first suffer through
“Martha My Dear” and ‘‘I’m So.
Tired.” which in the end is real-
ly a’drag.

Often a song which is as mys- _

terious and cryptic as “Revolu-
tion 9” can work when taken as a
whole provided its symbolism and
points of impression are solid and
consistent. But besides being mu-

 

 

sically vapid (a first rate exam-
ple of studio —— musician pompos-
ityl “Revolution 9” is an intellec-
tual insult. Iwould have preferred
nine. minutes of “Hey Jude” to
the langourous banality of “Rev-
olution 9." Of special importance
is the latest working of “Revolu-
tion 1” which is .slower and bet-
ter version" than the 45 release.
Second thoughts about a record-
ing are usually of great impor-
tance in helping to understand the
composer’s intentions. Slowing the
song down seems to emphasize
the fact that the Beatles’ intend-
ed revolution is to be peaceful
rather than violent. “Everything
is going to be alright."

The Beattles represent an en-
tirely different musical concept
than that of Sgt. Peppers. The
Beatles is in part an outgrowth of

the new trend in rock to returntoj
the styles of the late fifties and
early sixties. At a time when ro_ck
is in danger of becoming_ too in-
tellectual, too complex, nothin
could be ‘finer than a renewed
interest in this area. 7

There are many great songs on
this album. In fact there are only
about five that I seriously object
to. In some sense The Beatles’ is
better than Sgt. Pepper. Where.-
as Sgt. Peppers took us ahead into
a new trend of music and then
left us there. The Beatles takes us

Can Ridl Work Magic
* In Steel Bowl Tonight?

by Roy Jacobs = Sport Editor

, True, two basketball games and one win are hardly any-
thing_to get excited about; but campus sports fans desper-
ately need something to get excited about.

And Buzz Ridl’ is a quiet, reserved,_dedicated coach
who is hardly trying to be exciting. He’s more interested
in being respectable. But he and his team caused quite a stir
- in the Field House Tuesday night. .

V This weekend, especially tonight against Westminster,
Ridl and the cagers have a good chance to show that the win
I over William and Mary was no fluke. In addition, a good show-
ing in the Steel Bowl would enhance Pitt’s .-
...image in Pittsburgh.
Ridl is different from the other types
that have recently been brought to Pitt
-..:as_ head coaches. For one, he is not young
and dynamic. For another, he brings with
.;..him.a wealth of experience and, more im-
portant, a winning tradition —— a .704
"‘f"won-lost record at Westminster.
 , Varsity ‘athletes in the past have been JAC _
 ,know to grumble about their coaches’ backgrounds, but it
would be hard to find fault with Ridl’s. Yet, in a manner typ-
ical of him, Ridl plays down any effect his background might
. have. ~
“My record might ha ve an immediate effect in their
"  thinking,” he remarked, “but not a lasting one as they begin "
_to see themselves as a team. I think the players are looking
. :for something to have confidence in other than my record.’
\They’re looking for things from me that will help them as
‘  individuals and as a team.” . _ . ,
;; ‘  « The-new basketball coach has also taken a soft sell- ap-

-proach in pushing his team. He is hoping that the results
;and the ‘fans will do his talking for him. If campus reaction
to Tuesday’s come-from-behind win_ is any indication, the
approach is working. ’ . L.
.: ;_ffWe7re» just trying. to .play some respectable basket-;
_ ‘fall,’__’_ s.aysvRid1,- “and;w;e’l_l'se.e what the result-is when the _.
' game’s over‘. We don-’t predict any wins. They’ll take care of
themselves if wedo the rest.” .

. . Ridl certainly isn’t resting on his laurels. He inherited a
sock program, a losing tradition, a fair collection of ball-
players, and a schedule that lists only eight home games.
On the plus side he found an eager and-competent assistant
coach in Tim Grgurich waiting when he arrived. The road
back will not be easy, but a win like Tuesday’s will lighten
‘the load.

“It wasn’t just winning,” he commented, “it was how
we won. That type of win will help us in any ballgame we
play.

. “It’s important to a team to keep working and attack-
ing the same way,” added the master of the patterned of-
fense. “There’s no need to play catch-up basketball with
11 or 12 minutes. left. You hope it’ll break your way. Be-
sides, you put mental pressure on the other team. They know
you’re not going to crack.” '
The strategy worked against William and Mary. Starting
with the Steel Bowl, tonight, Ridl will have 22 more chances
this season. It’s a long way to go, but you just don’t bet
~ against a winner. - V

Ridl Expects Double Vision Tonight

As Hoopsters Oppose Westminster

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

Basketball coach ‘Buz’ Ridl is

expecting an attack of double
vision tonight as the cagers
meet Westminster in the first
round of Steel Bowl in the

lllllllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllIlllIllIIIIIllIllIIllIIIIIIIllIIlllllllIIIlllllllllllllIIlllllllllIIIllIIIIllllllIIllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllg S€COIld game at 3 ClVlC Arena

doubleheader.

“It’s kind of an odd situation,’.’
said Ridl, emitting a big grin,
“but I’m looking forward to it.”

Ridl spent his last twelve years
at Westminster, during which
time "he compiled a '216-91
mark. Ridl’s past success is-at-
tributed to the same strategy that
he is attempting to teach the
cagers.

_ “Naturally, they have a bit of a
jump on us,” admitted Ridl.
“They’ll be playing the way they

have been taught to play for a

number of years now; we’ve only
been doing it for about six_ or
seven weeks.”

Playing with much the same
style they played with under
Ridl, the Titans have already re-
corded a 2-0 mark this season.
In their last game Thursday night,
Westminster dumped Pvint Park,
97-70.

New head coach Ron Galbreath
has achieved early success de-
spite the‘ departure of four of last

it year's regular performers. Mike

Drespling, Fred McConnell,
Dave ‘Robinson. and _George Zep-
ernick are all gone from last
year’s, 22-8, squad, p ' , H

But Ridl warns, ‘‘they’re still a
quick, fact, good shooting team.”

Ridl is paiyitrlarly worried about

seniors’ ~ Russ_ ‘Boston and “‘Bup-
py” De Joseph.

’ ._‘‘B‘6sto'n‘'is‘ theirniost 'ia11iab1e

p1a“yer‘,”.' said Ridl’-L, v“Hej’is an ex-*

good rebounder,
and idefenseman. He

ceptionally
scorer,

. doesit all.”

The -6-2 co-captain averages
14.8 points per game last season
and lep the Titans in rebound-
ing. He was also named to the
All-District18 NAIA team.

“DeJoseph is a great outside
shooter,” said Ridl about the Ti-
tan’s starting guard and play-
maker.

DeJoseph will probably be
flanked be defensive guard Bill
Samuels who is noted for his
tremendous hustle. While Joe
Yos,t ’(6-3) and Dale Boyd (6-3)
completes the starting five. The
unit fits into the Ridl formula of
quick. good shooting hoopsters.

“We’ll have to counter with a
good defense." ekplained ‘Ridl.
“but we haven’t decided yet how
we’ll line-up. We’ll use both man-

.2 to-man and zones.”

Ridl does not intend to change
the ca -er strategy, despite the fact
that -Westminster will be using
the same method. Thus, shooting
might make the difference.
Ridl has always insisted that if the
cagers hit clost to 45 per cent of
their shots they’ll be hard to beat.

Tickets for both tonight’s
opening round of the Steel
Bowl and tomorrow night’s
finals are still available at
student rates of $1.50 per tic-
ket. They are being sold at
the Field House ticket office
and the Civic Arena box of-
fice.

Tuesday night, the cagers hit
only 41.2 per cent of their shots,
but hit 48.4 per cent in the sec-
ond half, and went on to top-

ple William & Mary, 68-62. In’

their opener against Rutgers Sa-
turday night, the cagers only

Steel Bowl Focus; 

managed a 40 per cent perfor-
mance, and lost, 74-66.

Ridl hopes to stick with the
sa re starting five that he used in
those first two games. Juniors
Rob McFarland, Rike Patcher,
and Charlie Hunt will be up front,
while senior Len Kalata and soph-
omore Mike Caldwell oandle tod
backcourt chores. Howdver, Cald-
well injured his ankle Wednesday
and is questionable.

But this ame they’ll be pitted

against a team with similar stra-
tegies.

Gymnasts Future Shaky As
Neiger Bets on Sophomores

by B_ILL NAAB

Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnastics team,
like so many other sports within the Universi-
ty, is dominated by sophomores and is in the re-
building process. Neiger has high hopes for his
young squad, but really doesn’t expect any mir-
acles.

His seven sophomores, however, will not be fac-_

ing varsity competition for__the first time this sea-
son. All were used to help fill out the meager sqad
of last year. Moreover, Neiger expects Mt. Leban-
on‘s Lowell Meek to be his leading performer this

season. Neiger’s run—down of the squad is as fol-’

lows:

champion in the floor exercise, can do well in the

allel bars and coming along well on the high bar.

—Mike Beatty—sidehorse is his best event, he
has started working on long horse, Vaulting, and

pecially on the rings, had a slow start because of
shoulder trouble, coming along fast.

Gym Team at
Army For
Stiff Opener to

Tomorrow afternoon at West
Point, coach Warren Neiger’s
gymnastics tea m challenges a
rugged Army squad. Both schools
belong to the EIGL — recognized
as the eight best gymnastic teams
in the East and Neiger‘/‘believes
that Army could be among the
best of the group.

“Army’s always tough, and this
year they could rank as high as
third in the league.‘ I’d ‘have to
rank Penn State and": Temple at
the top of the league, although
it’s hard to "tell since" no school
h as had any; meets _vet,”Vanalzed
Neiger. 

Neiger indicated that the floor
exercises and the sidehorseevent
should be his squad’s best events.
The weakest events will be, ac-
cording to the coach, the paral-
lel and horizontal bars. Neiger
expects Lowell Meek and Bernie
Jesiolowski to lead the way in
the floor exercise. .

Meanwhile, Phil Lilly. Mike
Beatty, and Jim Bileck will give
their best in the sidehorse dvent.
Their best efforts certainly will
be needed tomorrow because as
Neiger warns, “Army will" be a’
rough meet, and we’re not .that '
strong. We’ve got a real building
job ahead.” ’

Neiger would also like to add sophomore Jon-

along fine and would have been a big man on the

The coach also indicated that he will sorely
miss last year’s seniors — Dave Shidemantle, twice
the Easternychampion on the long horse; Tom Fish-
er on the still rings; and Bob Dodson on the hori-
zontal and parallel bars. ' i

In addition, Neiger explained that the trampo-
_ line event no longer will be a part of the gymnas-
tics meets. “The .NCAA rule's committee ruled it
out as a competitive event, but we’re still using it .
for training. There’s been a controversy for years
concerning the injury aspect,” the coach remark-
ed. Neiger just hopes that his thin squad of mostly
sophomores can make the most of the remaining
six events.

The athletes whom he was re-

three accounted for about 25-30 of

Grant has another reason to
show some sort of optimism.
Last year’s defeat came ,at
Temple’s pool.

“Last year, we had the disad-

vantage in the pool,” he mention-,

onto State Plays Host

Grapplers In Quadrangular 

by MARTHA HARTLE
Football isn’t the only thing happening at Ohio State.

This weekend, coach ‘Dave Adams and the matmen travel
to the Big Ten school in Columbus, Ohio participate in a quad-
rangular wrestling meet featuring the host school Ohio State
along with Hiram College and Eastern Michigan University.

“I don‘t know much about these three squads," explains Adams,
"but I do know ‘they're returning quite a few boys from last year.“

In that meet last year, Pitt finished third, behind Ohio State
and Eastern Michigan. “Ohio State won by a fairly big margin,” com-

mented Adams.

Dicklshildt, at 130, was the
only overall winner for the mat-
men in last year's quadrangular

-— and he‘s graduated. Bruce Un- _

angst. took second place at 123,
but he's injured and couldpossibly
miss the rest of the season. But

despite the absence of these two

light weights, Adams is still look-
ing for an improved showing over
last year.

“I sure hope we can do better,"
he commented. “I'll be disappoin-
ted if we don't.

“We should be much stronger

this year in the middle weights, "

much stronger than last year,”
he continued, “but we won’t be as
strong at the first two positions
where we had ‘Shildt and Un-
angst last year. We’ll have our
best chance of winning and of plac-

ing in the middle weights, going’

off the results from the Michi-
gan meet.”

Wrestling at the middle weights
will be four sophomores: Mark
Payne, Pat Lavery, BuddyMorris
and Bobby Kuhn. All four are un-
defeated after the opening meet
with Michigan last Saturday.
Kuhn, at 167, and Lavery, at 152,
picked up impressive wins in the
opener, while Payne, at 145, and

Morris, at 160, drew with their
opponents.

According to Adams, a major
factor in the meet will be the
drawing of , lots to determine
the pairings for the first round of
matches. "There‘s no seeding in
quadrangular matches. It‘s too
early in the season to seed. So they
just throw the names into a hat,
draw lotsand consequently the two
best guys in a weight class could
end up meeting each other in the
first round. The loser of the first
match can place no higher than
third, even if he wins his next
match. The draw will determine
alot.”

Adams will use the same line-
up this weekend that he started
in the Michigan meet. Paul Al-
len, at heavyweight, finished
third in that weight class at Ohio
State last year. Jack Kuhns will
go’ at 177; he didn_’t wrestle in
the quadrangular last season.

Going at lightweight for the
matmen will be Tom Grant, a
sophomore transfer,_ at 123; Duff
Case at 130 and-Larry Cuba, the
senior class captain, at 137.

The Ohio State encounter will
be the last for the grapplers until
after the holiday vacation, but

BOBKUHVN
Winner vs. Michigan

there will be a big home match
coming up early in January,
when the matmen host Navy.
Coach Adams has appealed to the
students to come out and see
his team in action. “Student sup-
port helps; we like to wrestle in
front of a full house. It‘s the stu-
dents‘ team, and we'd like them
to think about it that way." ~

Meanwhile, assistant coach
Bob Fehrs and the freshmen have
been working out and helping the
varsity in practice sessions. “We-
’re just trying to teach them our
system right now,” explained
coach Adams.

The frosh open their season Jan-
uary 18
Other opponents on the card for
the freshmen include Orange Coun-
ty Junior College, January 25;
Clarion State College, February
21, and the Navy Plebe Tourna-
ment in March.

W ope... 1...... WW,

But Thinclads Working Hard

by ED CONLEY

Some problems seem like they’ll never go away — like the
one that has been plaguing Track Coach Jim Banner. ‘ _
Banner has just begun preparation for the upcoming "indoor sea-

son. one that opens January 25 in Philadelphia for that city's Track
Classic, but he feels that he already knows what the major obstacle

will be this season.

“We still need a little depth,"
he commented. “We’ll have pro-
blems in the 1000 (yd.) and the
pole vault.

“But, we’ll have some good in-
dividual stars, he added.

Those individual stars-are led by
miler Jerry Richey who has brok-
en numerous records since coming
to Pitta little over a year ago.
Richey, who has an outdoor sub-
four minute mile to his credit.
will also run in the .2-mile chase.
He may see some action as a mem-
ber of the 2-mile relay team,
also.

Then, there’s Bryant Salter. Ban-
ner’s star jumper. Salter willbe
ready to go in the triple jump,
the broad jump. and the high jump
when the campaign opens. , '

BRYANT SALTER
l.rrl(Iinj_{ jumju 1

Banner noted that something
has been done this year to help
Salter a bit. “The high jump is
still a little cramped, but we did
the best we could,” he said,

Of course, the coach was re-
ferring to the. remodeling of the
Field House, where all home
meets will be held. He also men-
tioned that the new track could be-
helpful. ' ‘

“I think we’ll see better times.
but it’s still the boy, not, the
track,” he decided.

Some of the oehter thincladsi

who Banner expects a lot from

this winter are Smitty Brown,‘ "

Rudy Hufnaegel, Mark Vornhagen,
Dave Garnett, and‘ Dave Brinn.
This group ‘certainly fits the

coach’s description: “some pret- '

ty good individuals.” I

But, there is one runner who".

fits in that class who isn’t around
anymore — Roger Holly. .‘‘We’re
really going to- miss Roger,"
Banner said about, the runner who
has graduated, “It’s"hard to‘ re-
place a 1:49 half-miler.”

V Missing Holly _is~n'.t‘Banner's,
only worry. though. One of his

pole-vaulters, Bill Anderson. has

a back injury. Jeff Snyder is the

only healthy vaulter on the squad.
right now.

“He’s just going to have to do

A the job,” Banner reasoned. “That’s

it.” Anderson is, however,'the on-
ly_ injured thinclac_l' at the *mo-
ment. T . ’

“‘That’s enough for now,” the
coach remarked. “The schedules
always tough; it‘s really up to the
boys. They’ll have to double up.”

_ This year Harvey felt that the fight for the",

completed another winless season, while-the Panthers ha’

tory over William and Mary to mar their record: i -i "

“New Mexico and Pitt are teams that you ‘ca’ ,

r they gave up 39 points a game. San Jose beat them-A5
then San Jose.lost- to Washington State 46-0,*which,’ ve“
an idea how- bad they are.” . ' 

V I “Pitt had won only one game for the ‘last threefse‘asp
he continued. “You can’t be more consistent than that.f”-

.Harvey seemed to give the edge and the crown‘ "
Lobos, but Pitt presented very strong credentials. Thejilcfa
set a school record by giving up 393 points", were shut’ou’tT"
and were only able to-"manage slightly less than 10' p
game. It must have been that one civtory that gave A'N
ico the title.

Other teams which. Harvey included in the infamou
tom Ten were winless of .18 in a row.‘Wisconsin (0-10,

(O-8-2),, San Jose State (3-7), Brown, (2-8) and Northw‘.
(1-9), who defeated Wisconsin for its single win. ' "

One. more statistic‘ that -' Harvey points to with
the number'_of, coaches that usually leave after they
makes the lower ten. This year thereare three so far,  '

"‘This is one of my favorite times of the year, becaus
