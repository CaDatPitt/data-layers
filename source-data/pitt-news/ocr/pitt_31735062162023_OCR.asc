The feasibility of constructing an
underground parking garage to
replace the 233 spaces in Schenley
Plaza is presently being considered
by  e Pittsburgh Parking Author-

Joseph J. Wozniak.

“However. " he.

again cautioned. “we have a lot of
work to do before design of the

project is completed and the
economic feasibility ’ is
determined."

Wozniak feels there is a
tremendous parking deficiency in
Oakland. “A ramp would relieve
parking congestion on the streets,
reduce street traffic, and lower air
pollution levels, since fewer cars
would be driving around looking for
parking spots.”-

A preliminary report on the
Oakland garage prepared by an

engineering firm indicated the total '

cost -would be equal-to $10,000 per
car space.‘ Cost of a day's parking
would be about $3.25. According
to Wozniak, a final report should be
in within a month.

He also said funding of the
garage would be by a Parking
Authority bond issue. underwritten
by Pitt and the Parking Authority.

the University has not yet been
officially informed by the Parking
Authority of the proposed project.

Roling said. “February 6 the
Parking Authority will meet with
the University and we will review
the report. '

“We are not taking care of
students‘ parking needs." Roling
admitted. “But you just can't tear
up and build. There are an awful
lot of integral things to consider,
including complicated traffic circu-
lation patterns.

“Furthermore, the energy crisis
is directing a lot of political
attention to mass transit. Because
of all these things, you have to keep
a’ very -open mind about the
matter,” Roling added.

The tentative nature of the
project was stressed by John
Valley. community planner for the
Oakland area, under the Depart-
ment of City Planning.

"Although providing more park-
ing is a priority. there is presently
no commitment to a particular
facility." said Valley. “We're

Outgoing Student Government
President Rcge Kaufman has
outlined and presented to
the new Board headed by Presi-
dent-elect Mike Furick ﬁve propos-
als which Kaufman feels they
should give consideration to in
their first weeks of office.

Theyare:

«--Establishment of an executive

branch
--Setting up of new policies. such
as in allocating funds
--Take a stand on student leader
remunerations ‘
--Formation of a Student Govern-
ment Advisory Council
--Establishment of an undergrad-
uate studies program

Kaufman emphasized the estab-
lishment of the executive branch,
which will be made up of five
executive assistants.: v
“Each assistant would become an
expert in his own area. He would
be more or less a fact ﬁnder and
report back to the Board.”
Kaufman said.

WPIC Union Unsettled;

Workers Cite Harassment

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The union question at Western
,Psychiatric Instituteand Clinic,
(WPIC). remains unanswered.
lodged within the city court system.

According to Sam McGill,
spokesman for the members of
Local H99 at WPIC, the University
has been harassing labor-sup-
porters among the workers, while
those workers are without the
protection of a contract.

The University of Pittsburgh has
withheld recognition of the Local at
WPIC despite two court rulings in
favor of the union. The decision is
now pending within the city judicial
system, and no date has been set
for a hearing.

“It's a continuing battle of
intimidation." said McGill, “Once
the case gets into court they're
going to try and keep it there."

William Hannon, labor attorney
for the University, denied any sort
of action against the union
members at Western Psych.

“That's not the way the
University does things," he said.

Hannon explained the delay was
caused by court procedure. and

that the University was not
responsible for the delay.
It was William Hannon who

earlier promised a group of union
members that the attorneys for the

University would press for the
soonest possible ajudication.

Another worker at WPIC, John
Hartman, recently had a grievance
hearing to determine the validity of
a nurse’s charge of insubor-
dination. He feels the charge was
instigated by the administration of
WPIC.

“They told us to question things,
to give our opinion on things, and

problems of academic standards.

Also Kaufman proposes that
there be an assistant who acts as

An A-B-C-no entry grading
system, proposed by a committee
from Pitt’s psychology department,
failed to pass at last week’s College
of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Council
meeting. An appeal of 40 faculty
signatures is required to insure a
vote by the entire Faculty of Arts
and Sciences in late February.

The proposed grading system
would eliminate D and F grades
when a student performed below
the C level. However, for the sake
‘of completing required credit

, quotas for graduation, students

would have the option of getting a
D grade.

Dr. Donald McBumey, chairman
of the committee originating the
proposal, said “The present
grading system in use,.essentially
punishes the student for not being
able to learn.

“For freshmen who haven't
adjusted to college it will be of help
because it won't show up on their
records,” McBumey said.

The committee making the
proposal is composed of four
studentsand four faculty members
from the psychology department.

McBurney cited objections that
might be raised against the new
system. “It would require us to
change our grading systems. but
actually it would simplify
present system by eliminating D,F

and possibly W grades and would

“Another objection is how it
would be accepted by other
colleges, but it's already in use at
Hobar College in New York City
and a similar system is being used
at Brown University, but it’s too
early to tell the results. '

“A few years ago there was a lot
of discussion about grading and
nothing was done about it then.
Well, we’ve attacked the problem
in a scientific and scholarly
manner, researching the literature
for information while exploring all
the possibilities and this system
offers the best choice.

“I just hope that the faculty
realized that we've considered the
other grading systems and this is
the best system." McBumey said.

cited was that it might lower

and further University funding may
be discontinued.

The ﬁnal decision on funding
CIC will be made by Provost

there may be plenty of parking in

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The quest for better intramural
conditions for the thousands of Pitt
students who participate in the
“inadequate” program was quickly
started by various University forces
last September but has gradually
died down, if not out, since then.
a Last fall Student Government
(SGB) and the Student Affairs

A ' 2 , Advisory Committee (SAAC).be'gan
looking into the problems voiced by

nearly a concensus of student

intramural participants. Meetings

with SGB President Rege

Kaufman, members of SAAC and
A administrators and being planned
- in the immediate future.

In the interim, between the
initial start and meetings planned
for the future, Pitt students were
surveyed and over 200 ques-

. tionnaires returned. While ac-

knowledging large problems, can-
not be solved overnight, some
participants are still complaining
that conditions are not getting any
better.

Bemis--“B ut it all comes down to

money. It depends entirely on the
administration from the Athletic
Director on up. What they want to

~do with the money." photo by
Jaecks

     

SAAC member Jay Latterman,

who is also president of ‘the_

Intra-Fraternity Council (IFC) ex-
plained some of the complaints.

“There is a complete lack of
equipment and to _my knowledge it
is fairly widespread," Latterman
said. "Sometimes there are no
balls; referees are scarce because
of the bad system, and there are no
clocks or whistles.

“You could count on having to
use your own balls every other
game because there were none
available."

According to some students, a
typical incident is illustrated in a
letter from Latterman to intramural
Director Leo Bemis.

Latterman wrote: “This past
Sunday, October 14, 1973, there
were three intramural football
contests scheduled every hour for a
period of three hours. For these
three contests, there were two
footballs, no watches, and no
whistles."

Some incidents, such as people
stealing whistles when they are
available, add to the intramural
problems, Latterman asserted, but
in a survey conducted by SAAC, it
was found that most students feel
problems lie in the administration
of the activities.

In the survey. students were
asked how much they used the
athletic facilities, and what they
felt were the existing problems.

“If they didn’t use it (athletic
facilities) at all,” Latterman said
explaining the results. “They put

 
 

equipment down as the biggest
problem. If they did use the
facilities, (they said) it was the way
things were handled up there that
makes things difficult.”

Twenty-four intramural sports
are listed as available to Pitt

students in the 1973-74 Intramural
Sports and Recreation Handbook.
The sports range from touch
football and softball, to women's
squash and co-ed swimming. The
handbook also contains the regula-
tions and by-laws of the program.

The program has been in
existence at least since 1946, when
current Director Leo Bemis became
inyolved. Participation has in-
creased substantially in the past
three years, jumping from 3441
students (340 total teams) in
1970-1, to 4903 students in 1972-3
(437 total teams).

Bemis said ‘he recognized the
problem but does not share the
opinion of some participants that
they are totally “disturbing.”

Sp’ace was one problem he cited.
“I could get eight fields up in
Schenley Park in the early 50s.
Right now we just have two
all-purpose ﬁelds down in the back
(of Trees Hall) and on Sundays we
get the Stadium," Bemis said.

“Officiating is a universal
problem,” Bemis insisted. “There
are (now) 134 basketball teams and
an average of 12-15 games a night.
The average student is not
interested in this. If he wants a job
he will get one on a regular basis.”

Bemis, who pays his referees
$1.75 per game, explained that
since Pitt resides in an urban area,
students with the expertise and
interest in officiating can get jobs
in the city system, with junior high
schools, for example.

The Director, who is also Pitt's
soccer coach. said the Physical
Plant department of the University
is part of the program's problem.

“The University is supposed to
treat the surface of the two
all-purpose fields," Bemis ex-
plained. “One day it is like ﬂint,
and the next day, after a rain, it’s
mud.

‘‘It is supposed to be treated
with a Gulf Oil formula. something
with soap and oil. especially for
athletic fields. But you’re
supposed to treat it more than once
every four years.“

But the problem, Bemis said, is
that “somebody else says where
we spend the money. It all
depends on the Physical Plant
priority list. It is a Physical Plant
job, under, I assume, Operations.”

in reference to the extended
revenue being brought in this year
due to the successful varsity
football and basketball teams,
Bemis was asked how Coach
Johnny Majors felt about Pitt's
intramural program.

“l’ve needed an element of
cooperation from him concerning
theuse of the stadium. and he has
been very helpful,” Bemis said.
“But I haven't talked with him
about intramurals per se. I don‘t
know if John Majors thinks about
intramurals or not.”

Bemis stressed the idea that Pitt
needs to expand its facilities to
cope with the desire for athletic
activity.

“But it all comes down to money.
It depends entirely on the
administration from the Athletic
Director (Casmir Myzlinski) on up.
What they want to do with the
money.”

After the successful football
teams in the 1950s, Bemis said
some of the extra revenue went to
buy a golf course, what is now
Wildwood Country -Club. Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld sold it, however, in
his drive for excellence in
academics at the end of the decade.

“The logic (for buying the golf
course) was that the 'f athletic
director had the idea that since we
didn't have the facilities here, we
should go out there. They used to
bus students out.”

In the case with this year’s Fiesta
Bowl receipts, Bemis said “There
are good ways to spend it and a lot
of people should have input.”

The Director said he won’t
necessarily ask for a bigger budget
next year simply because the
athletic program is making more
money.

“I don’t.have any idea what the
University is going to do with it.
The money goes into a general fund
and they redistribute it. In the past
they have been taking money out of
the pot to keep this program going.

“l’ve operated with the philo-
sophy that you don't pad the
budget. Each year you are there
(the program still exists). When I
say we are going to play, 255
football games we play 255. And if
I say we are playing 350 basketball
games, that’s what we will play.”

Bemis said if he does ask for an
intramural budget raise, it would
be because it is difficult to
anticipate the weekly payroll.
Budgets are usually made two
years in advance.

He added he would like to see a
young graduate hired as full-time
assistant "intramural director.
Presently, his assistant, Al Coffey,
is also a diving coach. Bemis
stressed that Coffey would still be
able to work with intramurals even
with the additional staff.

Athletic Director__ Casimir
Myslinski, said he has been talking
with Chancellor Posvar and Vice-
Chancellor of Operations Joseph
Dutton about expanding the
intramural and general athletic
facilities. .

“We’re looking for land," he
said. “There is some behind the
new complex (on the Forbes Field
site) and we are hoping to get it
there."

Stressing that it is difficult to
expand ﬁnancially without build-
ing, Myslinski said he is in favor of
improving the present facilities,
and perhaps making the intramural
director's job a full-time position.

He would also prefer having
somebody working solely at one
job, and if possible. to take on a
coaching job if the work load
proved too light.

Myslinski said he realized Bemis
is exactly in that position presently,
but liked the other idea “just to be
sure we had a good program.”

SGB President Rege Kaufman
has expressed interest in a small
facility which could house various
sporting equipment items available
for checkout with an ID and a
driver's license.

Myslinski rejected the idea. “I
don’t think a personal type item
should be given to anybody. The
same goes for athletic equipment.

“If you borrowed a tennis
racquet you probably wouldn't use
it properly. These things are
costly. Everyone should have their
own tennis racquet and balls.”

Myslinski would not release
budget figures for the intramural

program, ﬁgures Latterman tried
to obtain last year. Myslinski said
it was too confusing because the
figures are categorized into various
areas and might be misinterpreted.
Some of them are supplies,
printing costs, officials, stadium
rental, maintenance, staff salary,
and heat. I

Kaufman, who feels the idea of
improving intramurals “stalled
with the whole process,” said since
the initial start last year, he has
written many schools to find out
how other intramural facilities are
operated.

He reported most of the response
was mixed, but the department
sometimes came under physical
education. Pitt's is under the
athletic department.

Explaining that the Student
Government has at least created an
awareness of the problem, he was
critical - of Myslinski’s attitude
toward intramural sports.

“The impression I get is that he
doesn't have enough interest to be
handling the intramural budget.

Myslinski--“We're looking for
land. There is some behind the
new complex and we are hoping to
get it there."

Myslinski isn’t helping it at all. His
positions are very vague,” Kauf-
man said.

Kaufman, who leaves
Thursday, reported that Chancellor
Posvar said in a recent meeting
that “out of receipts from the
Fiesta Bowl, a good portion will be
given to intramural and recrea-
tional sports.”

According to Kaufman,- a task
force is set up to further investigate
the intramural problem, and then,
make a recommendation report in"
April. Last fall, Kaufman had set

the intramural problem as one of '

off1ce.@*

the three SGB goals for the 1973-4 (51

._4‘.

school year.

Summing up the information
collected about the intramural
problem on campus, and what has
been done and accomplished, a few
puzzling problems remain:
----Intramural Director Bemis was
not aware that students were being
surveyed about the program, and
later, was not informed by
Kaufman or anybody else about the
survey’s results.

----Kaufman himself did not have
the survey results available;
apparently only Jay Latterman had
access to the figures which were
not totally broken into percentages’
yet.

----Bemis did not know about a
special SAAC subcommittee, of
which he was reportedly a member.
Neither did he know of a report the
subcommittee wrote as presented
to SAAC in November.

----Bemis said he “was instructed”
not to release budget figures for
intramural athletics.

--—-Casmir Myslinski. Athletic
Director, would not release the
ﬁgures to the Pitt News or
members of SAAC last year.
----Vice-Chancellor of Planning and
Budget Arlon Elser reportedly
would not release the budget
either, but expressed interest in
becoming a member of the task
force.

P apale described the public’s
interest in politics as “casual at
best. But one reason people aren’t
interested in an active way is
because people are puzzled,” he
said.

“To be politically aware requires
energy and time. The role of CIC is
to provide quick and easy access to

“The QPA system would still:
show the difference because of C r

grades and the D grades are almost
non-existent at Pitt anyway,”
McBumey said. ,

“Professors have changed their
attitudes about giving grades
because of the possible affect it
would have on the student's future
and because of the changing
feeling concerning D grades by
educators.

“We have sought the assistance
of the American Psychological
Association asking them to make a
study of the effects of different
grading systems," McBumey ad-
ded. “We're hoping that more
research will be done in the area.

CAS Dean, Robert Marshall,
insisted the vote on the system be
taken among the entire faculty
because he felt the system’s
changing affect was of such great
importance.

If the grading system is voted
down by the FAS, McBurney hopes
the system will be instituted by the
psychology department. He
added, that despite whether the
CAS uses thesystem or just the
psychology department, it should
be on an experimental basis subject
to future evaluation..: “A big
university should be able to
experiment," McBurney said.

A fourth executive assistant
would act in communications,
possibly closing many of the gaps
between Student Government and
the various organizations it recog-
nizes _and funds, Kaufman said.

Finally there would be, accord-
ing to Kaufman's plan, an
assistant-at-large. This person
would be a trouble-shooter and
help the president in the areas of
immediate problems. Whenever
there was a problem, such as the
proposed add-drop fee, the ﬁfth
assistant could concentrate his
efforts there.

"Since the president is elected
under a special election (circum-
stances) he should be in a postition
to appoint an executive branch with
the advice and consent of the
Board,"Kaufman said, explaining
the rationale behind the proposal.

Stressing the idea that Board
members should still be interested
in the five areas outlined in the
executive system, Kaufman said
the new group would be strictly
fact-ﬁnders and the Board would
remain policy makers.

“Board members should have
more time to talk philosophies--like
how they are going to allocate
money--what priorities do they
have--as opposed to performing
small tasks,” Kaufman explained.

Hartman speculated there was
administrative support for the
charge against him. “It was a
cheap shot," he said.

In the context of harassment,
Hartman cited changes in sche-
duling of hours as one method of
affecting the union movement,
“Some people are leaving because
they can't stand the admini-
stration,” he said. ‘‘I was hired for
the day shift, and now they’re

Dr. Thomas ,Detre, head of

WPIC, was not available for
comment, and Robert Valisek,

of the charges of harassment.

Larry Touming, a worker for
WPIC who left recently, said he felt
the lack of a contract and
recognized union was critical at
Western Psych. ‘‘If there had been

LIFE & CASUALTY

(From Handbook on Abortion, Photo by Dr. Wm. Hogan)

D & C ABORTION AT 12 WEEKS~—Pert'ormed between seven and 12
weeks, this method utilizes a sharp curved knife. The uterus is ap-
proached through the vagina. The cervix (mouth of the womb) is
stretched open. The surgeon then cuts the tiny body to pieces and
cuts and scrapes the placenta from the inside walls of the uterus.

One of the jobs of the operating nurse is to reassemble the parts
to be sure the uterus is empty, otherwise she will bleed or become
infected. Abortionists tend to skirt around “Legal Abortions: Early
Medical Complications” by Christopher Tietze, a top pro—abortion-
ist. His study shows stuff they usually won’t admit.

On Tuesday, Feb. 5, 8-11 p.m. in the Lower Lounge of the Student Union there will be an SHL-
sponsored seminar: “Abortion: Its Ethics, Propaganda, and Root Causes.” Pleaseattend this
humble examination of the issue. ‘

“The very considerable semantic gymnastics which are required to nationalize abortion as any-
thing but taking a human life would be ludicrous if theywere not often put forth under socially
impeccable circumstances. It is suggested that this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is neces-
sary bcause while a new ethic is being accepted the old one has not yet been rejected ., . . .

“The criteria upon which these“ relative values are to be based will depend considerably upon
whatever concept of the quality of life or living isdeveloped 2 . . . .

“One may anticipate further development of these roles (~medicine’s) as the problems of birth
control and birth selection are extended in evitably to death selection and control whether by
the individual or by society, and further public and professional determinations of when -and
where not to use scarce resources . . .,” says the author of an editorial in California Medicine
(Sept. 10, 1970; Vol. 113; No. 3; p. 68)——which may be verified in Faulk Medical Library. We will

“We're here to share our bodies
with our sisters." Hesitant
applause greeted the women who
made this defiant announcement.
Had the “bodies" been replaced
with “Knowledge" or “thoughts."
the response would undoubtedly
have been less unsure. But there it
was, “bodies." almost visibly

Jeanne expressed sadness that

and thoughtless obstetricians.
Lolly‘s relation of her experience of
delivery at the hands of a sadistic

her, ignited flames of response, as
local women began to pour out

And In Concert‘

BY KARL BALDYS

The stage looked beautiful.
Technological-optical delight.
Speakers ascended on the far left
and right like roman columns
framing a stage. A row of six foot
amplifiers formed the backdrop.
Front and center the microphones
were humming.
deur.

So. when Mary Smith found her
way through the wires carrying an
accoustic guitar and a cup of Irish
whiskey she looked out of place.
The microphones sensed this and
interrupted her first note with a

' squeal of feedback.

The Birtha—Mary Smith concert
was the final event in the‘Women's
Cultural Program that began
Wednesday and continued with
conferences and presentation_s
through Saturday night. Most
events were well attended but the
free concert in David Lawrence

only attracted about one thousand

students.

~“This is a women’s event. There
should be more women here.”

“Have you been _following the
week’s events?”

“Well, I drop in and out when I
I think the sisters who
don’t come are missing what the
women’s movement is all about.”

Mary Smith writes almost
“seventy .per cent" of her own
music. She has a smile like the
Cheshire cat, talks like Sandy

Electronic gran-»

Duncan and curtseys like the
animated Alice in Wonderland.
“I've been working, profes-

sionally, for about thirteen years.
But, I’ve been on the coffee house
circuit for about six. The thing that
bothers me about the circuit is that
I don’t get paid enough to bring
my band along.”

But Mary doesn't really need a-

band. Her voice is sweet. not
sticky, and when the final chorus

gets back she can muster enough
power to finish in style.

Q: Did vou know this was an all‘

women program?

“Well, no. I don’t do much
women’s lib material. I'm a
liberated woman, but I'm a cynic.

 

Really. I don't like the idea (of an
all-anything concert.)

“I do a lot of different things. but
I don't like to take sides on issues.
So many of my dreams have been
disappointed."

Regardless of her sexual politics
Mary drew an enthusiastic res-
ponse from the crowd. Saturday
was her second appearance here in
one year and many listeners called
out song titles, titles of Mary's
original work.

“Believe it or not, it's good to be
in Pittsburgh."

Birtha has cut ‘two albums on
ABC Dunnhill- The group,
together for five years, has toured
the US several times and has
toured Europe. They’re about to
cut a third album.

Shelley. the lead guitar player,
explained how Birtha began. “I
always wanted to play Rock'n Roll.
Istarted in high school and then I
just refused to give it up. We were
discouraged a little bit in the
beginning (being an all female
band) but. our manager
stopped telling people one way or
the other. So, we'd show up and
thecrowd would be suprised and
then get into it." ‘

Birtha is Rock ’n Roll in the
tradition ofpthe Rolling Stones.
Hard, loud, electric, gutsy music.

In fact the sound man was
sweating behind stage. _
“They're too loud. I wish I

I?

couldn't listen.

just-

. O..- .= . :'

The audience began to dwindle,
leaving a hard core of Rock ‘n
Rollers to boogie in front of the
stage and demand an encore.
Birtha didn't go over. It wasn't
because they lacked any of the
motions, but because straight Rock
'n Roll is a piece of carefully
guarded nostalgia. They were just
a little too rough with a fond
memory.

Shelley. “It was an off night for
us. I don’t like the hall [David
Lawrence] very much and Rose-
mary [bass] and Sherry [organ]
were both sick. I think Libber
[drums] was the only one of use

   

who was up for performing." A.
Libber smashed one of her sticks‘ .' 
early into the second song. .

Pittsburgh will offer Birtlta'j'..E‘»57‘
another chance. They'll be'7 
appearing this week at the White 
Elephant. Pittsburgh's the begin-1 . --
ning of an eastern tour that will 
take Birtha the next six weeks to i 
complete. '

Shelley. “That's the wayitgoes. .
Some nights you're on and some - —
nights it's like this.“ While she 
discussed it, the stage crew  
dismanteled the -equipment.
“We'd like to come back and try it
again though."

(including Hair) doing bits and
pieces for other bands. being
friends with all these musicians
and.eventua|ly forming Bedlam.
“We played last night in
Hershey...a lot of chocolate
venders runnin' around-weird
gee‘/.ers. they are...hardly any

advertisement for the show and we.
of course. hadn't any billing."
Cozy keeps struggling because of a
cold he picked up. “When you're a
supporter you're beaten before
you've started...no time for sound
checksf'

“A lot of people are saying that
rock is dying...rock music isn't

dying. It's changing. but not
dying. I wouldn't mind if
everybody'd be jumpin’ and

boppin' and tearin‘ the seats out‘. I
mean we’re a heavy band but we’re
not pretentious about it."

You know as well as I do there's
a difference between American and
English rock. Until a few years ago
there was a difference in East
Coast and West Coast rock. Bill
Graham brought that gap closer
together with his Filmores.

We've always had an exchange
of musicians across the big
drink...Steve Stills stole Graham
Nash from Mother England and the
Beatles even used Chuck Berry's
rockin' inﬂuence. But American it
seems has never really appreciated
British rock...maybe because of its
deep roots in the Classical tradition
that Americans have never gotten
used to it.

Bedlam is another heavy English
band...Melody Maker compared
them to Zepplin (who else), but in
fact they are not just another heavy
band. The musicianship these
fellows have ﬂows into a creative
rhythm. One that drives. releases
itself from those gimmicks of
snakes, eyelashes. drag queen

theatrics: “There’s too much
theatre going on...look: what
happens when you mention Jethro

rightfully so. And then say Ian

isn't on the musician but the act.

F

17 In AiRow!

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Williamsburg, V.--Bill Knight is
a better basketball player with one
arm than most collegians are with
two arms, two legs, and two
hometown referees!

The Pitt Panther basketball team
can function without Knight and
Mickey Martin, its top two guns,
more so than anyone would dare
lead themselves to believe!

Both these theories were proven
here in Williamsburg Saturday
night, as the Cats notched their
17th straight victory by nerving
past a discaplined William and
Mary team 68-62, in overtime.’

Knight and Martin, both injured
in the Penn State game last
Sunday, were obviously not in top
form. Martin, who was sidelined
by an errant Jonathan Marshall
kick and who missed .the West-
minister game Wednesday night,
started, but was rendered im-
mobile by the leg bruise and three
personal fouls in the ﬁrst ﬁve
minutes. He left after the third foul
and didn’t return.

Knight played and scored a
dozen points. The Cats needed
everyone of them and all of this
nine rebounds to ward off the
William and Mary charge. But, he
was nowhere near the Bill Knight
everyone has grown to know. His
badly bruised shoulder, injured in
that Penn State fall, was bumped
early and he didn’t lift it the rest of
the night. He shot and rebounded
with one arm.

“I gotvhit there and it was sore

from then on,” Knight commented _

before boarding the return ﬂight to
Pittsburgh. “I couldn’t bring my
control hand up as quick as usual
when I shot. I got my hand on a lot
of rebounds, but I couldn't control
the ball with one hand.”

The Indians, on the other hand
(no pun intended). did a ﬁne job of
controlling the robust Pitt offense
by virtue of a very discaplined
offense--a stalling offense if you
will. They held the ball, dribbled,
and, once in a while. took a look at
the basket. As unnerving as it
must have been for the Panthers, it
worked.

“We’re not a stalling team,”
Indian coach, Ed Ashnault said
after his .team almost ended the
longest winning streak in. the
country. “But we thought this was
the best way to beat Pitt. Ithink we
did a good job of shutting off their
high powered offense."

Holding the ball for 2:33 seconds
on one posession, the Indians led
25-24 at halftime and the feeling
was that if Buzz Ridl’s team got
behind in the second half it was all
over; They did, by three, and when
guard Rod Musselman, who scored
13 points, three behind teammate
Mike Arizin to lead his team, held
up one ﬁnger with 14:33 left, one
couldn't help wonder if that
signiﬁed the last shot. With 3:09
left, the Cats were down S0-46.
Then Kirk Bruce, who led the Pitt
scoring‘ with 19, hit a jumper and
Knight tipped in a shot resulting
from a Lew Hill jump ball to tie the
game. Hill made the play of the
"year seconds later by stealing a
pass ‘and going in for
uncontested go ahead layup.

“They kept making that slow

crosscourt pass," Hill noted. “I
missed the steal the first time I
tried, and Ijust decided to lay back
and wait for the next one.
' “As I was moving in for the
layup, I said, God, if I don't make
another layup in my life, let me
make this one," he added.

Arizin sent the game into

On Franklin & Marshall

the

 

Cats Outslick W&M Ambush

overtime with a jumper and when
Knight fouled out with seven
seconds left, Ridl’s team had
apparently lost its soul.

“I was. nervous," Knight re-
membered. “But Tommy
(Richards). Kirk (Bruce), Keith

(Starr), Lew (Hill). and Jim (Bolla)
kept their poise.” That, by the
way, is next year's team. A team
without Martin and Knight.

Forced to foul, the Indians sent
Richards and Bruce to repeated
foul line trips to insure the evasive
overtime win.

“Those guys must not have
blood in their veins," Ashnault
observed. “They seemed to thrive
on all the pressure. Especially that
6-7 guard (Starr). He was smiling
out there. He loved it."

Wonder what Ashnault would
have thought with a healthy Knight
and Martin in there?

 Matmen   Apply Lessons

BY G.W. STEVENS

The Pitt wrestling team has not
been able to stay with many of the
teams on their schedule so far this
year, but they have been wrestling
some of the top teams in the
country. Therefore, it isn't too
surprising that they have been able
to take advantage of every
opportunity to triumph over the
weaker teams on their schedule.
They accomplished this last week
when they bombed West Virginia,
and they were successful again last
Saturday afternoon when they
defeated Franklin & Marshall
College, '26-14.

The match was very close
through the first eight contests
with no grappler holding much of
an advantage over his mat
opponent. The only true mismatch
occurred in the very first pairing
when Tom Baxter pinned Pitt's Jim
Flint in 39 seconds. Flint was again
wrestling in place of George Bryant
who has not been able to make the
proper weight. Baxter’s pin gave F
& M a quick 6-0 lead, a lead which
didn't stand up for long.

Rande Stottlemyer got the
Panthers even in the very next
match with his pin of Paul Schuler.
The contest began as a ﬁerce battle
between the‘ 126-pounders with
Stottlemyer holding a slight edge.
He kept the pressure on and ﬁnally
caught Schuler on his back to tie

the score at 6-6.

The next two matches ended in
decisions going to Pitt. Bob Baily
won the first by a 6-0 score and was
soon followed by Jeff Wies. Wies
has been improving steadily
winning two of his last three
matches losing only to NCAA
champ Don Rhone of Clarion. His
7-1 decision over F&M’s Bill Palm
gave the Panthers a 12-6 lead.

Now it wasthe visiting team's
turn to battle back. Bill Kametz
and Kevin McCleary were able to
cop decisions over Pitt's Bob Kebr
and Ray Dallatore, deadlocking the
match at 12-12. This set the stage
for the most bitter contests of
the match.

At 167-pounds. Wally Morrel
battled F&M's James Grant to a
6-6 deadlock and was then awarded
the match due to his time
advantage. The next contest was
decided in the same way with the
victory going to George O‘Korn of
Pitt. The one point for time
advantage gave O‘Korn a 3-2
victory, and the Pitt squad lead in
the match 18-12.

George Calcagnini clinched the
Pitt victory in the 190-pound
contest when he was awarded a
victory by default. His opponent
was unable to finish the match
when he injured his knee in the
third period. Pitt’s Milt Schuler
closed out ther Panther scoring by

gaining a 2-2 draw with James
DeVenney.

Pitt will now have a week to
prepare for their next contest
against Lock Haven. The match
will begin at 2:00 pm on- Saturday
afternoon in the Field House, and it
should be a golden opportunity for
the Panthers to add another victory
to their 4-10 record. '

Remain In Second Place

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

Picture the champion UCLA
basketball teams. Now think about
young upstart Notre Dame. always
stopping UCLA's winning streaks,
but never stopping UCLA in the
Championship.

If you replace UCLA with Pitt’s
hockey club, and Notre Dame with
Carnegie Mellon's. you'll get an
idea what happened Saturday at
the Arena when CMU tied Pitt, 4-4.

Pitt has not defeated CMU since
March of 1972, but has won the
championship in both years of the
WPlHA's existence. In their only
other meeting so far this season,
CMU edged Pitt 6-4, and leads the
Panthers by the two points gained
in the win.

Mike Gallaway put CMU ahead
at 2:55 of the ﬁrst period when he

tipped a centering pass from Mike '

Kenworthy past Pitt goalie John
DeFazio.

Pitt tied the score nine minutes
later while enjoying a two-man
advantage. Bob Arturo went into

Competing inside a soup bowl can't

“Babies” came through the
experience in good shape although
possibly a little soggy from the

Going up against the best in the
country, the Tracksters showed
they take a back seat to no one.
The two-mile relay team which
ﬁnished on top at Pitt's Invitational
came in a very close second at
Cleveland but were leading most of
the way.

“Chuck Mozingo (the anchor-
man of the team) was way out in
the lead," said Banner, "but on

one of the Cleveland track's many

turns his baton was bumped and it '

just flew out of his hand. It was an
unfortunate accident, a freak
occurance, but‘ it happens.
Mozingo didn’t give up and still
managed to ﬁnish second."

Tim Riley, who set records last
week at Pitt’s Invitational with a
high jump of 7’ came in fourth at
Cleveland with a leap of 6’l0”.
This was Tim’s first jump while
wearing spiked shoes and he
couldn’t get his timing down very
good. “From now on Tim will be
wearing spikes so he should be
alright,” Banner said.

Rosborough maintained that only
a small number of the 300 to 350
male athletes at Pitt request
tutoring. .

“These tutors." Rosborough said.
“are generally gra(luate students
working on a master's or doctor's
degrees here. such as teaching
assistants or teaching fellows."

When an athlete makes a request
for a tutor for a course. Rosborough
contacts the chairman of the
department in question. who later
gives the names of three or four
possible tutors. “This way we
maintain sort of a pool of them."
Rosborough said.

To further ease the difficulties and
cost of an education, the athletic
department has established a
"book room" -for athletes on the
basement floor of Pitt's Trees Hall.
Any athlete may withdraw any
textbook from this facility for the
entire academic term at no cost.
The room is in effect an exclusive
library for athletes.

 Women Gymnasts Win,

Cagers Lose To Temple

BY KEVIN NOWE
Shooting is the name ofthe game
and on Saturday. against Temple

the women's basketball team left‘

their guns at home. The
Pantherettes could not get un-
tracked as they went down to
defeat 44-29.

The scoring potential of the
Pantherettes was evidenced by the
early lead they maintained
throughout the first quarter.
Temple began pressing at the
beginning of the second quarter
and the potential offensive attack
became a latent factor.

The Pantherettes were unable to
crack the press of Temple and
subsequently lost the lead with
5:00 remaining in the second
quarter. Temple wenton to score
12 unanswered points and led at
halftime 25-12. » «- ---

The inexperience of the young
Pantherettes was obvious through-

out the game as they missed easy
lay-ups and three blind passes into
the awaiting arms of Temple
players.

Pitt continued to fight through-
out the second half, but the
quickness and aggressive defense
of Temple stymied any possible
scoring threats.

Mary Ellen Klobchar led the
Pantherettes with 14 points. Coach
Sandy Bullman was not dis-
appointed with the team. but was
somewhat discouraged by their
shooting performance. “We
couldn't score. Sure it was nice to
have one girl in double ﬁgures, but
I believe in a five woman squad."

Chancellor Posvar was a surprise
visitor at the game. “I expect the
team to do well." he said, “and I
am sure today's performance is not
the usual for the team." The
Chancellor expects a tough battle
from the Women’s_ teams at
Indiana and Slippery Rock.

Despite the meet being held in
the “cereal bowl”, two records
were broken. The “Mad Hatter”,
Dave Wottle set a record in the
mile run with an amazing 4.03.
With only two 20 yard straight-
aways to work with, Wottle’s feat
could be called amazing. Possibly
a Sub-four minute mile might have
been reached on any other track.

The two-mile run record was also
broken by Art Nett who was
clocked at 8:32. Commenting on
Nett‘s run Banner said, “Probably
on any other track he could have
run an 8:20."

“Our boys showed a lot of
poise," Banner continued. “We
ran in all of the best heats ‘with the
best competition. I have to say I’m
very pleased with our perfor-
manee."’

It seems playing with the big
boys doesn't faze the men from
Banner.

Maryland Sinks Tankers On T echnicality

BY YAIER LEHRER

“It was a technicality that beat
Pitt today, not the University of
Maryland."

Those were the exact words of
the Maryland coach as his team
just squeaked by the Cats by a
score of 61-52 in swim action at
Trees Pool last Saturday as the
Panthers came off a win from the
night before over American Uni-
versity by a margin of 61-46. _

The Maryland meet is the one
that "the swimmers were really
after, using mostly second string-
ers in their win over American so
that they could save their best men
for the Maryland meet. It paid off
for the Cats, and although the score
doesn't show it, the Maryland
squad, knows that it was beaten.

In the first event, Mark Wallace,
Dave Natali, John Templin, and
John Schepne raced in the 400-yard
medley relay and beat their
Maryland counterparts. After the
cheering had died down for the Pitt
victory, the judges announced that
the Panthers were disqualified in
the race because Natali, who had
already swum in _the event, had
dived into the water before the race
was over to retrieve a bathing cap,
which according to the rules, is

illegal. The Panthers suffered the
penalty, and at the end of the first
event, the score was Maryland 7,
Pitt 0.

It was a margin that the Panthers
could not overcome until the end of
the meet when the score was 54-52
going into the final event, but the
Pitt mermen could not overcome
the well-stacked Maryland 400-
yard free style.

Before the meet, Coach Dick
Bradshaw had said that the
chances of a Pitt upset were pretty
slim. but during the meet, he kept
on telling himself that if his team
had won the first event, they would
have won the meet.

“We really went after that first
relay." said Bradshaw. “The
Maryland team planned their meet
so that they would stack the last
relay, so that we didn’t and
couldn't have our best swimmers in

the last event."

“The better team today was the
University of Pittsburgh,” said the
Maryland coach, “there is no
question in my mind about that.”

Matt Glenn of Maryland grabbed
both first places in the distance
races with Jerry DeMuro and Walt
Young picking up second and third
places in the races. Glenn ran
away with the ﬁrst race as he
opened up a large margin in the
first few laps it was a different
story. Glenn widened the gap
early, but towards the last few laps.
DeMuro started to close in on the
lead and in the last two laps, Jerry
got closer and closer, but at the end
could not make up for the early lost
mileage and had to settle for
second place.

In the 200—yard individual
medley, Carlos Santiago opened up
an early lead but began to lag a bit

in the breaststroke portion of the
race and allowed the Maryland
swimmer to get close enough so
that when it came down to the
free-style portion. he could not hold
on to the lead and ended the race
with a second in the event.

Santiago came back in the two
hundred yard backstroke to take an
undisputed first place as he opened
up a big lead in the beginning and
didn’t let go of it. Mark Wallace
grabbed second place, as he kept
an even pace throughout the race,
and swam past some of the
Maryland swimmers as they could
not keep up with their own pace.

In the diving events. Bob
Petrovich of Maryland took first
place in the one meter diving
contest with Tom Fatyol right
behind him in second place, while
the third place spot was nabbed by
Jack Garrow.

It was this event thatlmade the:

score 54-52, leading up to the ﬁnal
event, that Maryland had stacked
so well that the Pittsters had to

resign themselves to a very 

undeserved loss.
