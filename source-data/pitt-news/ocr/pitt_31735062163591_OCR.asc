tion was taken to see if “the many’
adverse comments on the Health

Service circulating around campus
are/the truth or a lot of heresy-.”

After tabul-ating the results of
the poll, Miss Druckemiller con-
cluded that the “many and vari-
ous slanderous stories seem to be
the outgrowth and prefabrica-
tions of misunderstood or un-
desired diagnosis. People like to
have things to complain about.”

None of the students polled
rated the Health Service less than
average. Only four students con-
sidered the waiting period longer

Typical comments about the gen-
eral nature of the Health Service
ran like this: “We’re lucky” and
“It's very efficient.”

VOLUNTARY CONGREGATION is what Negroes
prefer to call the seating arrangement in the
Tuck Shop in the Cathedral ground floor. Many
students said that they prefer to sit in this section

B, Tuck Shop Not Segregated: Negroes

 ‘Prefer ‘Voluntary Congregation’

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

The Negro students in
the Tuck Shop in the

K ground floorof the Cathe-
dral tend to congregate in
one ‘corner of the cafeteria.
But the Negroes do not

consider this segregation. Ned
Harrison, a Druid with a 3.0
QPA, calls this “voluntary con-
gregation.”

“Everyone seeks his own
group,” Harrison explained.
“We’re not sitting apart from
everyone else. We’re just get-
ting together among ourselves.”

Harrison went on to explain
that people coming into the
Tuck Shop tend to seek out
their own interest groups. “If
you check the rest of the cafe-
teria, you’ll ﬁnd that most of
the Jewish kids and Catholic
kids seek out their ‘ religious

. groups because they have more
in common. lt’s the ‘same with
us.”

Luther Henry, a junior here,

elaborated on Harrison’s ex-

- planation. “We don’t have to

sit here if we don’t want to.

It's just that everyone else sits

here. If I want to ﬁnd out

where one of my friends are,

I come down here (the Tuck
Shop).”

Looks Segregated
Harrison then explained that

to an outsider, the Tuck Shop
probably does look segregated.
“But,” he added, “if I ever
want to sit somewhere else, all
I have to do is get up and move.
No one in here has ever tried
to stop me. I don’t.think any-
one ever will.”

Each year. freshman Ne-
groes are appalled by the ap-
parent situation in the Tuck
shop, vowing to "move into .
some other area of the cafe-
teria. "But - what difference
would it make?” Harrison
asked. “We would only vol-
untarily congregate some-
where else. .

“We’re not segregated,” Har-
rison continued, “we just feel
a mutual» warmth.”

“That’s right,” Henry broke
in. “I know I stop and say
hello to every Negro I see. I
don’t care if he is a‘ professor
or a garbage man. That same
,.kind of warmth is present
among the Negroes at Pitt.”

Get Along

Harrison added, however,
that a similar situation exists
among the white and Negro
students at Pitt. “There are no
incidents among students here
that I-can think of,” he said.

Memorial

Book Fund

Friends of the family of the
deceased Michael Locker, former
University student, have made ar-
rangements with the University
for establishment of the Michael
Locker Memorial Book Fund.’

His death Jan. 9 was attributed
to an overdose of barbituates.
He _was a premedical sophomore.

Contributions to the fund
should be made payable to the
University, and letters should be
addressed to Dr. Alan C. Rankin,
assistant chancellor of student
and general affairs. Receipt of
contributions will be acknowl-
edged by the University treasurer.

Dr. Rankin has been named to
select the area of books to be or-
dered, and the University librar-
ian will select books in that area.

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

After seeing “Strait-Jacket,"
the other evening I’ve been
working on a theory that may
prove to be a shocker to the
cult of Alfred Hitchcock. It is
my opinion and I wish it were
able to provesuch a thing, that
there is no Alfred Hitchcock.

Underneath the blobs of fat, and »

behind the veddy British fog-
horn voice, is really‘ a man
named William Castle. “Who is
William Castle?” did a voice
from the Peanut Gallery in-
quire? I’m glad you asked.-

Mr. William Castle-has been
in the shadow of Alfred Hitch-
cock for so long that he im-
ports all of ‘his raincoats from
London. He is the very success-
ful producer—director of such

_horror—ﬁlled fun-fests as =“House

of Wax,” “Homicidal,” “I Was
a /Teenage Werewolf?,” and the
latest morguenum‘-opus, “Strait-
Jacket.” Mr. Castle seems to
have taken the discarded scripts
from" the Hitchcock studio and
has turned them into something
short of phenomenal .hits.“Blood,
gore, s c r e a m s, coffins, black
capes, a_nd.now, axes, —— this is

. the stuff of which Castle’s imag-

ination is immersed. And the

payoff has been“ large.

the producer has gotten the au-

thor of “Psycho/I Robert Bloch,’

to‘concoct a wild tale about a
woman who has returned from
a , funny farm ,a f t e r having
served 20 summers for committ-
ing two axe ‘murders. You know

.:’the story —— this sweet, good

looking thing_ (Joan Crawford,
mind you!) comes home one
night to ﬁnd her husband in the
arms of another (and I don’t
mean another husband either).
She becomes enraged and picks
up an axe because it happens to
be the nearest thing. She then
makes like Hank Aaron and both
adulterer and adulteree are as-
sorted bits of ﬂesh. Poor Joan
has gone off her’ nut and so she
is whisked off to the insane asy-
lum.

y

We ﬁnd her returnedito civi-

lization and to her brother’s.

home, where she is trying to re-

. capture the love of her daugh-

ter who hasn’t seen her in

and all, is the raving mother
and she plays her -with-the same
abandon that was on view in
“Whatever Happened to Baby-
Jane?” Luckily, I "skipped the
opening credits so the rest of
Mr. Castle’s sterling reportory
group goes without further men-
tion. There is a great deal of
fun for the ﬁlmgoer who dotes
on such goodies and followers
of Alfred Hitchcock will ﬁnd a
-deiﬁ_nte second-rate parallel in
some of Castle’s directorial
tricks.

The peculair fascination that
these types of motion pictures
have had for audiences is one
of those enigmas that has mys-
tiﬁed critics throughout the his-
tory of ﬁlms. What began with
the antics. of Lon Chaney in the
silent ye a rs _ and continued
through the days of Peter Lorre,
Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi,
has been one ofthose crazy suc-
cess stories of ﬁlms and the kind
of story that no one refuses to
question. It just happened; and
Vincent Price has become the
Clark Gable of the horror-set in
recent years.»

Whatever the fascination, I’m
quite sure that these movie-

-_ makers respect their audiences
In his latest thriller-diller,

and are just trying to supply
the product that their public
seems to crave.

Although his ﬁlms are on the
grade-B level, William Castle
has emerged as one of the lead-
ers of the shock-school of cin-
ema and is deﬁnitely cut from
the same cloth as the hugh~ Mr.
Hitchcock. ’

ly focused on Fairmont State

. No profundities

 

It is perhaps time for students to begin giving a little thought to
the lowly position they occupy in the hierarchy of this institution.

In the ﬁrst place, this University, unlike many comparable in-
stitutions throughout the republic, is not primarily concerned with the
education of its students. This is ‘a manifestation _of the new trend in
higher education which disclaims the old classical image of the Univer-
sity as a place where students may further their education in favor of
* the modern image of a community service organization employing the
greatest minds of the century gathered together in a suitable environ-
, ment for the solution of economic and social problems. _ _
, Since providing the student with an education is no longer the
primary responsibility, of. this University, it stands to_reason that the
student is not considered as important as he normally would be under a
 so-called classical system. Consequently, student wishes -and desires are
viewed for the most part as the babbling of «children unﬁt ‘to have a say

in their own lives.

Unfortunately this is a condition which is accepted almost without
. qu‘estion. Few students, if any, ever really stop to consider how very‘
L g . little influence their opinions have in the formation of University policy.
‘ It would probably surprise most undergrads to learn that at a sig-

   me’ 52...]... Position - Tliircl In line  

niﬁcient number of colleges students do take an active part‘ in university -.;

government. At these schools‘ students are included in administrative
meetings on problems of planning, academics, and ﬁnances. Such is
unfortunately not the case at this University because the common under-
graduate student is rated comparatively unimportant when stacked up
against Panther Hollow, the space research center, and Appalacia.

However, it would be foolish for students to begin demanding *1
more representation in administrative decisions involving undergradu-

ate activities at this point in the game. It’s really just too late to try

and repair the damage.

The student organizations on this campus must view the situation
as it exists with a realistic eye. The undergraduate stands third in line—
after community service and research, and— must realize that there is
not now, nor is it very likely that there ever will be anyreal power in

the hands of the students.

Objectivity is the goal of a

Then there comes the time

This opportunity exists because
the writer has paid his'"“dues”

‘missed too many deadlines.

I have searched for a good

Think Sargent Shriverl should

of a better way for an un-

No Excuse

Finals No Time for Cramming

Editor,’-‘The Pitt News:
Recently I was somewhat ap-

palled to read in The Pitt News _

an article by Miss Nancy De-
laney. The author of that ar-
ticle seemed to be suffering
from acute indigestion as a re-
sult of having to take all her
ﬁnal examinations in the same
week. .

The greatest objective raised
by Miss, Delaney was that she
had only one day in which to
review and digest each of her
subjects—-subjects which had
taken a minimum of 125 hours
to consume.

What I would like to -know
is this. It 125 hours have been
spent in consuming a subject
and presumably another 250 in
reviewing and study, it (2 hours
out of class per 1 hour in class),
then why would more than one
day be needed before a ﬁnal
exam. After all, a ﬁnal exam
is not intended to ﬁnd out how
much cramming the student
has done the night before the
exam, but rather how much
comprehension and knowledge
of the course the student has
procured in the course of the
trimester.

enough time to cram.” So,
Miss Delaney,_if you do not
have enough cramming time
at the end or a semester,
study hardervduring its dur-
ation.

Furthermore, Miss Delaney
complains that ﬁnals*w'eek has
no value at all and that it is

I think it serves,

cial at all.
two very useful ‘functions. First
‘is the more obvious use-—it
somewhat‘ enables the pro-

fessors to judge the degree of‘

accomplishment attained by an
individual student, during the
course of the term. This, of
course, enables the professors
to give -fairer grades.

The other useful purpose of
ﬁnals week is perhaps even
more valuable. It forces those
students who have not kept up
with their work. during the
term to do extra amounts of
work at its end. Undoubtedly,
these students do notllearn as
much as if they studied when
they were supposed to have
studied, but nevertheless, they
do ﬁnally do a certain amount
of studying. For these reasons
I think that ﬁnalsweek is in-

_dee_d useful and not farcial.

 Wrestlers Defeated by Army;
  Challenge Maryland Tomorrow

By BOB SNIIZIK

Cinderella sports teams don’t often come along and it
now appears that the Panther wrestling team won’t fall
into that category.” Optimism over the matmen soared
last week when they beat defending Eastern champion
Syracuse, but the optimism proved unfounded as the
wrestlers lost to Army Saturday at West Point, 17-12.

The wrestlers travel to College Park, Md., tomorrow where
they face Atlantic Coast Conference champions'Maryland at 8 p.m.

The Panthers led Army, 12-11, with two matches to go and
needed only one win to take their second victory of the season.
The wins never came as Ken Barr lost to Tom Abraham, 4-3,

at 191-pounds and heavyweight Bill Beck was decisioned by _

Ed.Cate, 2-1.

Barr could have won the match for the Panthers if he
had managed to stay away from Abraham in the closing
seconds of the match. He led 3-2 with ﬁve seconds remaining
when Abraham scored a take down to win. A

Barr did almost the exact same thing against Michigan last
year when he led Jack Barden in the closing seconds. Not realiz-
ing this, Barr went for the take down, but instead was taken
down himself and lost the match and the meet.

Beck spotted Cate 40 pounds in the heavyweight battle and
did surprisingly well in his second collegiate bout. Both grap-
plers scored on escapes, but Cate escaped earlier and received
a point for riding time.

Duff Killian and Mike Johnson got the Panthers off to a 6-0
lead in the 123 and 130-pound matches, respectively. Killian
scored the first dual meet win of his career over Ed Johnson,
6-2. Mike Johnson defeated Bob Robbins, 9-5.

Army tied the match up in the next two bouts as Ed
Winborn beat Clair Riley, 7-0. at 137-pounds and Mark
Scureman beat Frank 0’Korn, 7-2, at 147-pounds.

Pitt got two more wins at 157 and 177-pounds as Dino Boni
beat Ray Sepeta, 11-5, and Lee Hall edged Gwynn Vaughn, 3-1.
Army got ﬁve points at 167-pounds where Bob Arvin pinned
Tom Baily at 4:33.

It was Army’s third win in 13 tries against the Panthers.

Maryland has never beat a Rex Peery coached team in seven.

attempts. They, will probably be favorites, however, tomorrow.

to ﬁve. I -

Within ten seconds the lead was’ up to 11
and the Mounties comeback was stifﬂed. First
Dave Roman put in one of his eight
long jump shots, then he stole the in-bounds
pass and converted it, and then Larry Say-
kowny stole the ball and layed it in. The, score
was 60-49 and WVU was beaten. _ ‘

“Those three quick buckets were the turn-
ing_ point,” said coach Bob Timmons. “Today
was our best effort of the season. Our seniors
were getting a little complacent‘ but they seem
to be out of it now. All of them played a great
game,” continued Timmons. _ __

West Virginia coach George King agreed.
“-Pitt was more aggressive on all points. They
outhustled us from start to ﬁnish. My boys_
weren’t mean enough. And they’re not going
to win until they are,” he said. . I

King continued, “I knew we were in trouble
late in the ﬁrst half when Pitt forced us to
come out of our zone defense. When we play a

* man to man defense we hurt ourselves offen-

sively because we don't have that fast break.”

West Virginia was forced to come out of
its zone mainly because of Rom'an’s,outside
shooting‘. Roman had four ‘long shots in the

    

ﬁrst half and added four more in the second.
In totaling 18 points he shot a fantastic 84
percenton nine of 14.

Generalovich was the games high scorer

with 22 points, and only a bad day at the foul:

line ‘kept down that total. The General re-
bounded well and when West Virginia pressed
the Panthers, he dribbled it up court himself,
0309 going the length of the court for a lay-
up that brought the crowd to its feet.

Paul Krieger tied the Mounties’ Tom Lowry
for rebounding honors with 17. Led by Krieger
the Panthers outreb‘ounded'"the m u c-h taller
Mountaineers, 52-43. Many times Pitt had four
men under the basket and several times they
had two or three shots. ‘

Cal Sheffield did well in getting six re-
bounds. ‘He also scored 19 points and stole
the ball several times. Although he has im-
proved considerably, Sheffield still has a ten-
dency to hold the ball too rnuch.__When he does
this, Timmons does not hesitate to I substitute
sophomore Szykowny.

Siykowny scored
eight points and passed
well in a brief appear-

_ ance. The other sopho-
more, center Bob Lov-
ett, also did well ﬁll-
ing in for the ‘foul-
ridden Krieger. Both’
boys have shown’ im-
provement lately and
along‘ with Dlaryle,
Ruby should form the
nucleus of'next year’s
squad, RICKY RAY

Although theyhad a badvday from the foul

 

‘line against West Virginia, the team is shoot-

ing about 77 per cent onthe year. This has won
them a. couple of games. While the team, ex-
cluding Sheffield, who was seven for »-seven, was
cold from the foul line, they shot an amazing
48 per cent from the field.

Lowry and Ricky Ray led the ‘-Mountaineer-s
with 21 points each. Their efforts, however,
could not prevent West Virginia from losing,
and dropping its record to 9-8, the poorest in
Morgantown in many years. '

The Panthers seek their ninth win, of the
season Wednesday night when they host Kent
State, team which beat Duquesne, 62-60.

The 48 entries in Intramural basketball have been divided
into eight leagues instead of seven, as originally planned. This
change occurred when the Dental School joined the indepen-

of the one league system used by the engineers and dormitories.

Tom Jones, assistant for intramural director, stressed that
“There is no difference in quality in the A and B leagues.” He
added that this division is “merely for convenience” and that it
doesn’t entitle either league to any privileges. , ’

League competition is scheduled from 4-8 p.m., Monday
through Thursday at the Stadium Gym. Jones said, “Games

Dennis Moffatt, B.A., Coe College, Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, '57, joined Western Electric in 1961 after two
years of graduate work at the State University of
Iowa and two years with the Army. Most important
to Dennis was the fact that WE offered him the

at Western Electric’s Hawthorne Works in Chicago
as a Staff Trainee in Industrial Relations.

After only a year with the Company and the
completion of one of WE’s training programs for
college graduates, Dennis became a Personnel

A GUIDE FOR THE Gnlnnns

One of the most interesting academic‘ theories advancecl in
many a long year has recently been advanced by that interest-
ing academic theorist, E.’ Pluribus ‘Ewbank, Ph. D. who holds

a the chair of Interesting Academic Theories at the St. Louis

College of Footwear and Educational Philosophy. Dr. Ewbank
said in the last issue of the learned journal, the Mount Rushmore
Guide to Scholastic Advancement and P7'esiden.ts’ I-leads, that we

« might be approaching the whole problem of student guidance

from the wrong direction. -

Dr, Ewbank, a highly respected pedagogue and a lifelong
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes, (I mention Marlboros for two
reasons: first; to indicate the scope of Dr. Ewbank’s brainpower.
Out of all the dozens of brands of cigarettes available today,-
Dr. Ewbank has had the wit and taste to pick the onewith the
most ﬂavorful ﬂavor, the most ﬁltracious ﬁlter, the most soft
soft pack, the most ﬂip top Flip Top box: I refer, of course, to
Marlboro. The second reason I mention Marlboro is that I get
paid to mention Marlboro in this column, and the laborer, you
will agree, is worthy of hishire.)

But I digress. To return to Dr. Ewbank’s interesting theory,
he contends that most college guidance counselors are inclined
to take the easy way out. That is to say, if a student’s aptitude
tests show a talent for, let us say, math, the student is encour-
aged to major in math. If his tests show an aptitude for poetry,
he is directedtoward poetry. And so forth. '

  

All wrong, says Dr. Ewbank. The great breakthroughs, the
startling innovations in, let us say, math, are likely to be made
not by mathematicia.ns—whose thinking, after all, is constrained
by rigid rules and pi-inciples-but by mavericks, by noncon-
formists, by intuitors who refuse to fall into the rut of reason.
For instance, set a poet to studying math. He will bring afresh,
unfettered mind to the subject, just as a mathematician will
bring the same kind of approach to poetry. .

By way of evidence, Dr. Ewbank cites the case of Cipher
Binary, a. youth who entered college with brilliant test scores in
physics, chemistry, and the calculus. But Dr. Ewbank forced
young Cipher to major in poetry. ‘ ‘ =

The results were astonishing. Here, for example, is young
Cipher’s latest poem, a love lyric of such originality that Lord

He was her logarithm,

She was his cosine. —

Taking their dog with ’em.’

They hastened to go sign .
Marriage vows which thcyjoyfully sha.-red, '

' And wooed and wed and pt 1- squared.

Similarly, when a freshman ‘girl named Elizabeth Barrett
Sigafoos came to Dr. Ewbank to seek guidance, he ignored the
fact that she had won the Pulitzer prize for poetry when she
was eight, and insisted she major in mathematics. Again the
results were startling. Miss Sigafoos has set the entire math
department agog by ﬂatly refusing to believe that six times
nine is 54. If Miss Sigafoos is correct, we will have to re-think
the entire science of numbers and—who knows‘?—— possibly open
up vistas as yet undrcamcd of in mathematics.

Dr. E_wbank’s unorthodox approach to student guidance has
so impressed his employers that he was ﬁred last week. He is
currently selling beaded moccasins at Mount Rusl1n1o1'e.
