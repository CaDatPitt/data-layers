Board of Trustees approves university tuition increase

By  Knapick
and Julie Sabol
T be Pitt News

Pitt’s Board of Trustees approved a
$709.7 million budget for 1993 late last
week. And as the proposed budget became
fiscal reality, so did a six—percent tuition
hike for most Pitt students.

“I don’t think any of us like to see tuition
increases  but it’s reality and we have to
look at reality,” Frank Cahouet, a member
of the Board of Trustees, said.

The budget includes a state appropriation
of $155.1 million. This funding, while

Safety T as/e force calls‘
for additional campus
transportation services

marking an increase of $235,000 over last
year’s appropriation, is $4.9 million less
than the amount originally earmarked for
the university last July.

“In view of harsh ﬁscal realities, this
year’s budget was crafted in a spirit of
prudence and careful economy and with
a real measure of pain,” Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O'Connor said. “I don’t like tuition
increases.”

For most Pitt students the tuition increase
amounts to $256, placing Pitt's tuition $2
higher than that of Pennsylvania State
University.

In order to enhance the current
transportation system, two
additional campus buses and
three additional shuttleshave
been recommended to Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor
by the Chancellor’s Task Force
on Safety and Security.

To cover the $700,000 cost of
the additional vehicles and a
proposed new office of
transportation services, between
$25 and $50 may be added to
students’ tuition bills as a
transportation fee, according to
the recommendation.

Student Government Board and
Task Force memberJacob Brody
said, " When we presented this
idea to students at open forums
we sponsored throughout the
year, there was a lot of reaction
in favor of [the additionalcostl so
long as transportation would be
guaranteed."

Task force Chairperson and Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Harmon said the fee
should be levied for the fall term.

staff and administrator who use
the system should pay a fee as
well. -

“It’s something that has to be
established because transpor-
tation has not kept up with the
growth of the university. We’re
very behind in keeping up with
transportation to students and
members of the university
community,” Harmon said.

With the new proposal there
would be a total of three campus
buses, three shuttles and two
vans on call available to
students.

Brody said the university
currently spends $190,000

Department for the one campus
bus and two vans.

The task force was established
with three goals in mind,
according to Brody, including
researching and reviewing the
Public Safety Department and its
policies, making recommen-
dations to the chancellor for a

for Business and Finance Ben Tuchi said.

Any budgeting process involves deciding
what to cut, what to keep and who should
pay. But what is most unique about Pitt's

new budget, according to many university -

officials, is how that was done.
“Determining the budget] wasn’t

something that ._was done with the
involvement of many people,” Tuchi said.

This year’s budget was determined in

of students, faculty and administrators.

 

The UPBC served as a representative group
that channeled input from various
university groups into the budgeting
process. .

“We never had the [UPBC] prior to this
year. It helps to have the inputs of the
various constituencies," Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Business and Finance and
Budget Director Rhonda Gross said.

This year also marks the beginning of a
new, more democratic budgetary system
initiated by O’Connor. Under this new
system, the deans of the academic
departments were told by how much their

Problems not hindering SGB 2/an-call system

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

By making the van-call system
more efficient the Student
Government Board hopes to
make Pitt’s campus- safer for
students, according to SGB
president Gil Golden.

There have been problems with
the van-call shuttle, and some
changes will be made in the
service. The van service is
necessary for student safety and
is gettingalot of use, so it willbe
continued, Golden said at the
SGB’s summer meeting held this
weekend.

“Certainly the ridership was
tremendous. That's the best
indication we have that the
students liked it,” Golden said.

“We want to keep the service,
but we don’t want to keepthe
cellular phones,” he said. “[’Ihe
cellular phones] are very
expensive  something like 90
cents a minute per call per
telephone."

According to Golden, some of
the van drivers were calling each

other on the phones, and students
could not get through to the van
drivers with their ride requests.
“Those phones were tied ‘up,
and we were therefore paying for
a service that was inaccessible to
students  That is very frustrating
 Afterthis was noted and called
to the attention of [the Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harrnonl and [the Director
of Public Safety William Brennan],
these calls continued to occur, to
a lesser extent, but they still
continued to occur, ” Golden said.
Golden said the SGB will look
into some type of central
dispatching for the shuttle vans,
as well as getting funding for the
van-call program from Pitt—’s

transportation or public safety.

departments.

In other business, the outdoor
cafe planned for the area between
Forbes Quadrangle and Hillman
Library has been moved to the
William Pitt Union.

There was already a large pool
of students who would make use
of it atWPU, according to Golden.

“The union is already a popular

hangout place,” Golden said.

It will be easier to provide
entertainment at the cafe if it is
located in WPU, according to
Golden. '

‘‘We’ll try to work with the [Pitt
Program Council] to have
programs on the [WPUl patio,”
Golden said.

According to Golden, another
reason to move the site of the
cafe was the lack of a ﬁrm business
commitment from the owner of
the Second Plate to provide food
carts for the cafe. Pitt will be able
to provide the food if the outdoor
cafe is located at the Union.

Other services that are being
looked into by the SGB:

-Acquiring radios for the
student escort service. “We’re
contacting the companies that
Public Safety uses to get its
materials such as walkie-talkies,
CBS and dispatch radios. Then
we’ll probably draft some letters
and see if we can get them
donated or get them at some
humongous_discount. As Public
Safety just told me, one of those
walkie-talkies can run around

$400 to $600 for_one. We’re in
need of about 20,” SGB member
Jacob Brody said.

-A student book exchange that
would allow students to put their
names on a computerized list
with textbooks they want to sell
and match them with students
who have books they want to
buy.

0A miscellaneous book
designed to include items not
covered by other sources of
student information.

oExtension of residence-hall
cafeterias’ and Roy Rogers’ hours.

-Expansion of the Choice
Dollars Program to include
“Choice Checks,” checks that
students can use to buy food at
locations that do not have choice-
dollars machines to read ID cards.

-Creating a guide on how to
voice complaints, concerns or
comments about such things as
public safety, instructors;
maintenance workers, housing
and the Book Center. “There is
no such guide currently at the
university,” SGB member Melissa
Smith said.

PPC schedules events for fall term 1

By Edward Goldhahn
suqf Writer

The Pitt Program Council
promises to have a calendar full
of fun activities in the upcoming
school year, according to
Assistant Director of Student
Activities T om Misuraca.

“We’re booked for the art
gallery in terms of art exhibits,
and you'll probably see two
lecturers coming this fall,”
Misuraca said.

PPC plans activities such as the
Homecoming Cruise, Frisbee
Golf, CPR, weekend movies in
David Lawrence with reduced
rates for students, first aid courses

‘ ~ and guest lecturers.

Last year's guests included
former Speaker of the House Tip
O'Neill, and columnist William F.
Buckley.

“The activities are planned by

students for students,” Misuraca

said.

PPC is an student organization
that is responsible for all of the
cultural, recreational, educational
and social programming at the

university, he said.
Eight different committees
make up the council. The

committees range from arts to

travel and are all’ composed of
students. .

According to Program
Coordinator Donna Lirn, there
are approximately 300 students
during the school year who work
with PPC. _

“Any student can become a
member of a committee; they
can even join more than one if
they can manage it,” Lirn said.

While organizing an activity,
the students are responsible for
contacting any agencies and Pitt
administrators.

They are also responsible for
all aspects of a program from the

beginning through the end,

Misuraca said.

“This is a place for the stu-
dents who become involved to
learn what I like to call Real
World 101 or 102, depending on
how involved they get,” Misuraca
said.

According to Misuraca, each
committee has one student

"' 3? U 1”;  U '-:-:- ..:-'. ,

director who is responsible for
motivating and recruiting
committee members.

The committee director is also
responsible for working within a
budget. The program
council’s budget comes from the
mandatory student activities
fee.

Formerly the Pitt Union
Program Council, the Pitt Program
Council reformed in 1980,
expanding its activities campus-
wide rather than only in the
William Pitt Union, according to
Associate Director of Student
Activities Joyce Giangarlo.

“Back in 1979 we only had six
students. It was the end of
February in 1980 when we started
with the new constitution, the
new name and a broader scope,”
Giangarlo said.

“When new students come in

and they change, the programs, ~

change to keep up with the
student population’s wants and
needs. Every year things
change; that’s what makes us
better and better,” Misuraca
said.

Clinton vis its city
on campaign trail

By Stephen Flinn
Staj)“ Writer

‘ Stressing the need for leaders to be in touch with the common
people, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton and his

running mate Al Gore brieﬂy stopped to speak with Pittsburghers -

as part of their “Crusade for Change” 1,000-mile bus trip across
the country. .

“Pittsburgh was chosen because it's an important city, and Mr.
Clinton feels there are a lot of people in Pittsburgh who want
to hear his message,” said Ethan Zindler, Clinton's press
secretary.

1 “[Former president John F. Kennedy] said it was time for
change. We are saying the same thing today,” Clinton told the
crowd as a statue of Kennedy overshadowed him.

Focusing on the need for change in the country, both of the
candidates addressed the crowd, and then answered questions.
Although predictable questions such as, “.What are you going to
do for us?" were asked, others‘ asked about the Kennedy
assassination, abortion and jobs. Clinton said a new full-scale
investigation of the Kennedy assassination is greatly needed.

He said he is strongly pro—choice, not pro-abortion, and he
said he doesn’t want women and their doctors to be treated like
crimina1s.Clinton also outlined several plans for job programs.
Cleaning up as well as environmental researching will provide
many Americans with an income, according to both Clinton and
Gore.

Cathedral Lawn excavated to replace steam pipes

By Pete Kapustynski
News Assistant

The recent excavation of the
Cathedral of Learning lawn is
part of a project to replace aging
steam lines that heat Pitt buildings,
according to Pitt’s Manager of
Mechanical and Energy Systems
Edward Permar. '

The portion of the project on
the Cathedral lawn is almost
complete, but the rest of the
project will continue this summer
and after a halt due to winter will
resume next year, he said.

“There are two steam lines that
extend from the Cathedral  to

Presbyterian University Hospital. __

That's about 2,300 feet. Those
lines are almost 50 years old.
This project is to replace those
lines. Those lines provide heat to
almost all of the hospitals in the
medical center,” Permar said.
“This system [of steam lines]
serves all of Carnegie Mellon,
also. It’s relatively large, probably
the 15th largest in the country or

somewhere in that
neighborhood,” Permar said.
The main part of the project is

on the streets between the-

Cathedral and the hospitals. “We
are starting on the north side of
Fifth Avenue and constructing a
tunnel from that point
approximately 2,300 feet long to
the Presbyterian hospital. The
construction in the Cathedral lawn
happens to be a ventilation shaft
for that tunnel,” Permar said.

Facilities management is
planning ahead with this project
to provide steam service to future
buildings, Permar said. “What we
are constructing now are mains.
There are connections to be
installed on those mains for
buildings that don’t exist.

For instance, in the vicinity of
the Syria Mosque there are
connections on those main lines
for whatever will be built there in
the future.”

The ventilation shaft in the lawn
of the Cathedral of Learning is
almost finished, Permar said.

“What you see on the Cathedral
lawn is nearly done. Any day
now, that will be brought back
up to [its] normal surface and
they will be planting grass," he
said.

"The main part of the project is
across the street  and [work]
will take place throughout the
summer. We should be ending
the work probably in the
beginning of October,” Permar
said.

According to Permar, the work
is halting in October for the
winter, but the project will not be
done.

“The project will start again
next summer. We’ll start as early
as possible. We’1l finish the
second half next year. We expect
to be done in September of ’93.

“lWe expect these lines to last]
100 years. The first lines were
just buried in the ground and
they lasted almost 50 years, which
is uncommon. The average
buried steam line lasts about 25
years, so we got exceptionally

long life out of the [old] lines,”
Permar said.

Pitt’s constmction methods
were responsible for the
extended life of the steam lines,
according to Permar. “A great
deal had to do with the way they
were installed," Premar said.

"The university then used great
care in the installation [of steam
lines] done in 1947. It was
expensive when it was done.
There were things done which
were uncommon in order to
preserve and extend the life [of
the steam lines]. It was

. successful,” he said.

“We think with the tunnel we
will double the life [of the steam
lines] again. As long as the tunnel
is ventilated, there is every reason
to believe that the lines will last
100 years.  r

[The ventilation] prevents
temperature buildup and tends
to carry away any moisture that

seeps in. The enemy of these-

[steam] lines is water and heat,”
Permar said.

Cocaine .
addiction
researched
by WPIC

Edward Goldhahn
Staﬂ' Writer

An innovative research and
treatment program studying
alternative methods for treating
cocaine dependent individuals
has recently been started at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, according to program
coordinator Judy Lis.

“This is treatment. I want to
emphasize that none of the
treatments we’re doing here
are experimental in nature,” Lis
said.

Alternatives in Cocaine
Treatment is a multisite project
funded by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse that includes
four universities. Pitt’s program
operates at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, and other
sites are located at the University
of Pennsylvania’s McLean
Hospital, Massachusetts
General Hospital, and
Brookside Hospital of Nashua
in New Hampshire.

“I think doing a multisite
study is exciting because we
get to collaborate with the other
institutions,” Lis said.

According to Lis, the relapse

' rate of cocaine addicts is much

greater than that of other
substance abusers. Because of
this fact, the researchers are
administering alternative

treatments, and comparing

them to the commonly used

‘standard treatments.

“We’re looking at two
alternative treatments, called
supportive-expressive
psychotherapy and cognitive
behavior therapy, to see if these
more advanced, alternative
methods might help people stay
away from cocaine better than-
the standard treatment,” Lis said.

The Cognitive Behavior
Therapy alternative treatment
involves working with the
patient’s faulty information
processing, underlying ideas
and unhelpful assumptions.
Created and directed by Aaron
Beck M.D., this treatment
basically aims to reprogram
patients’ addictive tendencies.

The other treatment, created
and directed by Lester Luborsky
Ph.D., involves improving

. patients’ relationships and

occupational status, along with
helping the patient to identify-
problematic attitudes and
conﬂicts.

Since the project began
admitting addicts in May of this
year, approximately one-third
to one-half of the addicts still
remain in the program, Lis said.

The executive committee of
the Student Publications Board
of the University of Pittsburgh
has namedjason Hillman editor

in chief of ‘The Pitt News,
effective immediately.

Megan Bertino resigned from
the position last week.

Latin Americans gain Valuable skills

By Lori M. Bossert

 Staff Writer

i 753.

\€‘\

By teaching management and
computer skills as well as product-
and cost—analysis, Pitt’s Center
for Latin American Studies’ SEMLA
program helps Latin American
citizens gain valuable skills to
help them in their home countries,
according to SEMLA coordinator
Ivan Brenes.

This month the center is holding
its sixth annual SEMLA, a
development seminar for Latin
American professionals.

SEMLA is a seminar conducted
in Spanish on the “Selection,
Design, Evaluation and
Implementation of Policies,
Programs and Projects.”

Held for six weeks each

summer, the seminar focuses on
the skills necessary to design,
implement and evaluate long-
term projects. Word processing
and the LOTUS computer-
programming language are also
taught. ’

This summer, 14 people from
seven different Latin American
countries are attending SEMLA.
The project is funded by their
employers, the Agency for
International Development and
the University of Pittsburgh.

“This seminar is for people
[who work in] banks,
governments — any type of
organization which must work
with projects,” Brenes said. “For
example, we have two people
from the Central Bank of
Venezuela who often work with

internal planning.”

SEMLA’s primary objective is to
strengthen the management skills
of its participants, particularly the
skills related to long—term projects.
To achieve this goal, the
professionals attending first learn
the phases of a project, then
design their own with help from
the instructor.

“There’s a lot to this seminar,”
Brenes said. “They learn project
design, cost—benefit analysis,
feasibility studies, implementation
and evaluation, as well as the
computer skills  We get people
with such different backgrounds:
bankers, engineers, architects.
The seminar helps them to extend
their professional skills, teaches
them to work within an
organization.”

Patient remains in serious condition

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

The patient who received the first—everbaboon—
to-human liver transplant three weeks ago at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is still in

serious condition.

In a routine biopsy performed last week,
doctors found the new liver has grown 30 to 50
percent larger than its original size, which was
approximately two-thirds the size of a human
liver, according to a UPMC press release.
Doctors -say the patient’s level of bilirubin, a

      

component of bile secreted by the liver, is normal for
the first time since he contracted the hepatitis B virus,
according to UPMC spokesperson Lisa Rossi.

The patient is clinically stable, shows no sign of
rejection and has normal liver function. Doctors are
adjusting his medication to the typical dosage for a

human~to—human transplant recipient, according to

Rossi.

Previous cross—species transplants have not been
successful because of tissue rejection. UPMC doctors
are optimistic that the new combination of drugs,
including FK506,,will combat rejection and infection,
according to the UPMC press release.

Grassroots effort aims ‘
to reduce city council

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

Directing a grassroots voter initiative, “The Drive For Five,” -
Pitt student Ray Wolfgang is hoping to reduce the Pittsburgh
City Council from nine members to five.

A press release from Wolfgang states, “Hundreds of city
workers have been cut in the last 2 years. Let’s extend these
budget cuts to City Council!”

“Some people say I'm just a disgruntled person, but that's
what this country is about. One person getting mad enough
about something to try and make a difference,” Wolfgang said..

“Pittsburgh’s population has decreased from 600,000 in 1959
to 300,000 in 1990. Why do we still need nine council
members?” Wolfgang said.

Wolfgang also says the city council does less and less. “City
government has been relinquishing more and more of its
responsibility and accountability to more and more authorities,
boards, commissions and community based citizens groups,"
Wolfgang said. V

However, Wolfgang says he is not alone in thinking city
council should be reduced.

“I believe if the question [to reduce city council] is put on the

ballot in November, it will win by a four to one margin,”
Wolfgang said.

To get the question put on the ballot, Wolfgang must get

enough signatures on petitions.

allocations would be reduced.
The deans themselves then
decided whether to cut
programs, raise tuition or do

both. ,

“lThe deans] were allowed to
either reduce expenditures or
increase revenue. Each unit had
a team to determine what was
best,” Gross said. “By allowing
the units to decide for
themselves the most appropriate
method for reallocating funds,
we had a more open and
participatory decision-making
process.”

The School of Law, for

‘- example, chose to increase its

tuition by 10 percent rather than
cut programs. The School of
Engineering, on the other hand,
will increase its tuition by only
4.2 percent and cover certain
expenditures with other funds
within the department.
Overall, the deans of the
academic departments trimmed
their individual budgets by an_
average of 2.7 percent through
expenditure reductions or
through revenue enhancement.
“We’re hoping that next year's
process will be more streamlined
and started mu ch earlier,” Gross
said, adding that this "year's
budgeting process did notbegin
until January. “Next year we’re
going to start planning the ﬁscal
year '94 budget in the fall.”
“Once the planning and

' budget system is approved, the

university will embark on a long-
range planning process. Once a
long-range plan is in place, the
decision-making will appear to
be more rational,” Gross said.
Such a long-range plan will be
developed by faculty, staff and
students and should reflect the
priorities of the university,
according to Gross.While trying
to keep tuition hikes at bay,
O’Connor also managed to
reward what he called the

“outstanding work” of staff
members with a pay increase.

“We were determined to
provide all faculty and staff
with an increase in
compensation, though at a
level far more modest than is
merited by the outstanding
work that continues to be
performed university-wide,"
O’Connor said. An allotment
of $9.8 million in the new
budget will allow for a 2.5-
percent . increase in
compensation for faculty and
staff not covered by collective
bargaining agreements,
according to a university press
release.

The university library
system's acquisition budget will
be expanded by 20 percent
under the new budget. Other
additions include $1.8 million
for the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, $1.2 million for the
restructuring of the
administrative services of the
university, $2.1 million for
student financial assistance and
$325,000 to cover operating
costs for the new Center for
Biotechnology and
Bioengineering.

While a tuition increase was
again necessary to balance the
university budget,
administrators emphasize that
things could be worse, and
Student Government Board
President Gil Golden praised
the university’s attempts to
restrain tuition increases.

“The university must be
working extremely hard to
keep the increase at six percent,
considering the cuts by the
commonwealth,” Golden said.

“I am grateful to the entire
university community for their
support and understanding as
we advance ‘our missions of
instruction, research and public
service during this time of fiscal
difficulty," O’Connor said.

or a person whose drug abuse leads to
depression. There ’s a very strong link between
drug/alcohol abuse and mental-health
problems,” Kennedy said. '

Leeds said the group is aimed at this link,
going beyond other substance-abuse programs
by focusing not only on the addiction but also
on the mental disorders of those who have
become addicted.

“Some of the folks are already familiar with
other programs, through Alcoholics
Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. We’ve
had people that have gone to these other
programs. Each [of these other programs]
seems to center on a specific area. ,

“This group, which so far is unaffiliated with
any official organizations like NA or AA,
hopes to incorporate the feelings, to bind
people, so they can pull together and identify
with what’s going on when ‘I’m feeling
psychotic’ or ‘I want a drink’ or ‘I’m hearing
voices.’ There’s a special bond there,” Leeds
said.

Leeds said the people that will come to a
dual-recovery group might not feel as

comfortable in a single-issue group. Telling a.

roomful of strangers at an AA meeting that
you also hear voices, Leeds said, can lead to
more problems and confusion, rather than a
solution.

“Think of how difﬁcult it is for the average
person to fight an addiction. So imagine a
person who’s psychotic, or is up one day in
the peaks and down-in the valley the next, and
they are still trying to ﬁght problems of drug
and alcohol. '

They want to be productive; they want to be

good parents; they want do a number of things
while fighting two terrible things, a mental illness
and an addiction,” she said.

“It is a vicious cycle. Some people said their
psychosis led them to use drugs in an attempt to
self-medicate. Statistics bear the fact that men do
not like to seek counseling or therapy as easily as
women, and they attempt to self-medicate with
drugs or alcohol,” Leeds said. “When they start
getting depressed, then they’re spending more
time at the neighborhood bar with the Bud
Lights.” .

One of the main purposes of the group, according
to Leeds, is to give its members alternatives to
drinking or using drugs. Once the group becomes
more cohesive, Leeds plans» to offer literature,
lecturers and medical information about the effects
of mixing cocaine or heroin with an anti—psychotic
drug or an anti—depressant.

Leeds said the people who have been coming to
the “We Reach Out Group,” which held its first
meeting this past May, are usually getting some sort
of treatment, either at an outpatient clinic such as
the Hill Satellite Center, or with a private psychiatrist.
Although there are usually only a handful of
attendees at the meetings, Leeds said she’s not
discouraged.

“So far it’s been discussion, good, supportive
discussion, getting to know one another, even
though they’re a small group. There are a few that
are beginning to see one another as members of a
group, that ‘We belong together.’ 'Ihey’re interjecting
personal experiences, offering some suggestions,
which are interventions on how they fought a
particular problem or addiction," Leeds said.

"The very fact that I have three or four people
that are really willing to commit, that’s important,
that in itself really means change.”

Although the proposal has been
made, Brody said he fears time is
running out.

“Come August 29, there will be
around 800 students in
residence facilities up on the hill
who will be in need of
transportation from the upper
campus to the lower campus.
We either need to see a speedy
implementation of the

temporary establishment of a

Tuition Remisson

Pitt Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor, with his back to the
wall due to the state’s cut in appropriations for university
funding, should be commended for easing the students’
financial burden by keeping an inevitable tuition increase
at six percent for in—state students. The increase is equal
to $256 a year. .

Governor Robert Casey signed a bill earlier this mon
that gave the university a 3.S—percent cut in state
appropriations for the 1993 fiscal year.

While the state’s money is not insured, O’Connor could
have easily guaranteed the university the money by
raising students’ tuition even higher to cover the lack of
state funds. 4 ‘

Instead he was committed to keeping tuition as low as
possible and working with faculty, staff and students to
draft a budget that was acceptable to all. This is the first
time all constituents of the university had a say in
determining the school’s budget.

O’Connor, who often stresses a need for more open,
representative involvement at the university, is sticking to
his rhetoric.

His ability to keep the tuition increase at a minimum and
his willingness to allow all of the university family
a say in the budget are positive examples of an
administration and chancellor that may be seeking and
demanding, as opposed to asking, for a change in
university actions.

Death to Star Wars

In yet another episode of the continuing saga of the
“Star Wars” defense plan, the energy department cancelled
the final testing of a nuclear—powered X-ray laser, once
considered the gem of the project.

A new Bush Administration policy that limits nuclear
testing for the safety and reliability of weapons was the
reason the test was cancelled. Tens of millions of dollars
were already spent on the test, according to The New Yorle

Times. _

It is admirable that the current trend is toward reducing
the amount of nuclear testing. The Russians and the
French have suspended such tests already.

The down side is that this cancelled test adds to the
appalling amount of money this country has spent on the
Star Wars program. T wenty-seven billion dollars have
been poured into the program over the last nine years
with no noticeable results. The House of Representatives
has allocated $4.3 billion more for Star Wars research for
1993.

In a time of economic crisis, that money, small as it may
be in comparison to the entire budget, could be used
more effectively. The disappearance of the overwhelming
threat of Soviet nuclear weapons makes Star Wars a low
priority. .

With education dollars shrinking every year, an extra $4
billion especially to college students,‘looks like it could be
well used.

Enviromental work vital to future

Regarding Tim Desmond’s
article (July 15) on Environmental
follies. Why should young people
be discouraged from doing
environmental work? Surely there
is room for all fields. I’ve seen
enough primary tropical forest
destroyed to convince me that
there is a need for this kind of
work.

Plundering the Earth’s natural‘
resources, with little thought for
the future has been the order of
the day. Killing off of species has
been done at a rate without
parallel in nature.

I Man-_made monocultures, and
overpopulation with a few

domesticated species has caused _

unusual climatic changes, soil
erosion and desertification. No
one can deny that the price of
progress is high.

We cannot divorce ourselves
completely from nature. Trees
and marine plant life produce the
oxygen we need. The quality of
our food supply depends on the
fertility of the soil on which it is

grown. Properly managed, wood ,

can be a renewable source of
building material and fuel.

I agree that the poor should be
helped, but is charity the way to
do it? We want tobe rich; and the
richer we get, the more ruthless
we become, even though we
may contribute large sums to
charity and education. Having
robbed the victim, we return to
him a little of the spoils, and this
we call philanthropy. Most of us
live each day as rapidly and
thoughtlessly as possible, and
leave to governments, to the
cunning politicians, the direction
of our lives.

Israel misunderstood
The June 10 issue of The Pitt
News reported that the Muslim
Student Association was to march
on campus to remind the public

that it has been 2'5 years that

Israel has administered territories
now being disputed.
What they and your reporter

failed to remind the public are

»' '.».V-)‘_.‘_,‘ t“. 2;": ' .

several critical features.

1. Israel came into possession
of the land only after the
combined Arab forces blockaded
Israel, chased out UN
peacekeeping forces in the Sinai
and, most importantly, threatened
to “push Israel into the sea.”

Letters

2. For 20 years, Jordan occupied
Jewish ports of Jerusalem,
including the holiest place to
Jews for a thousand years — the
Western Wall of the Temple. Jews
could not worship there.

3. ‘Over 50 synagogues and

cemeteries in Jerusalem were_

destroyed by the Arabs during
their occupation.

4. The Arab occupiers
prevented free access to Christians
and Muslims to religious shrines
in Jerusalem. When Jerusalem
was liberated in 1967, the Israelis
permitted free access to all
religious pilgrims. For the ‘first
time in history, all of the major
religions control their own shrines
and worship in peace.

5. For Arabs living in disputed
territories of Judea and Samaria
and Gaza during the 25 years of
Israeli administration, infant
mortality, longevity, maternal and
child clinics, immunization rates,
psychiatric services, post-high
school education and availability
of household electricity and water
have improved dramatically.

6. Arab women in the disputed
territories were the freest in the
Arab Middle East. Unfortunately,
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in the disputed territories has led
to the disappearance of western-
style dress and customs and the

’ appearance of religious “police”

and gangland-style killings of
women. _

The Arab—Israeli conﬂict is
perhaps the most complicated
conﬂict in modern history with
issues of anti-Jewish hatred, oil
economics, introduction of
western democracy into an area
ruled by kings and-totalitarians
and secular society versus

 

religious fundamentalism. One
needs to get beyond the sound
bites and the vicious diatribes
and to work for peace, security
and rights for all in the Middle
East.

Pro-lifers bashed

This letter is in response to the
article in the June 17, 1992 Pitt
News. This article detailed
Governor Clinton's appearance
on MTV. In this article you
reported of how Vice President
U. Danforth] Quayle had met with
the Cardinal‘ of New Yorl_<’s
Catholic Church and how Cardinal

"O’Connor supported canti-
abortion “terrorists.”

Can you people at ThePtttNews
ever print an article that doesn’t
have some very opinionated
comment in it as anti-abortion
“terrorists”? It seems to me that
The ‘Pitt News has a difficult time
providing the students with a
clear and unbiased view on a lot
of things, and abortion is one of
them!

How can you call Operation
Rescue terrorists when the
archbishop of New York's
Catholic Church leads a prayer
vigil in New York with a support
of 2500 pro-life people, and also
on hand were 800 pro-abortionists
counter demonstrating? Who do
you think was arrested for
disorderly conduct
demonstrating? It certainly wasn’t
the pro-life people, but in fact it
was 11 of the pro—abortionist
demonstrators. So how can you
justify calling Operation Rescue
the terrorist when in fact the pro-
abortionist are the aggressive
militant group here. This was a
peaceful prayer march, led by
the Catholic Church. I think the
wrong group has been labeled
the terrorist. ' '

’ Pittsburgh, which is slowly but
definitively becoming :a_"'

respectable outlet for
underground and avant garde

sounds from across the country '

and beyond, will play host to a
month’s worth of sounds and
styles that are usually relegated
to cities with a keen interest in
the experimental.

As the ﬂyer reads, if you're
bored with the ordinary, then
come and experience Noise Fest
‘92, a cacophony of sounds
highlighting the ‘Burgh’s
experimental music scene: eight
bands worth of electronically
manipulated sounds producing
drones, powerful noise, low key
and off—kilter squonking,
complete with no vocals and lots
of low rumbling. Eight bands in
two rooms in one night in four
hours — this Friday night starting
at 10.

If this low—blow intellectual
affair isn’t enough, then you’re in
quasi—luck because Alice Donut
and its freak show return to town
for the billionth time, looking to
challenge Jawbox for most visits
to Oakland. From the teen—angst
label Alternative Tentacles the
Donut serves up a warped brand
of punkish antics with just the
right dose of cynical humor,
enough to make you say, “Damn,
I don’t know if I love ‘em or hate
‘em.” Also on this circus bill are

 Pitt-Penn State football rivalry comes back to life

 

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

After nearly dying in the land of stalled
negotiations, the Pitt—Penn State football
rivalry was been reborn last week.

Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes and
Penn State Athletic Director Jim Tarman
announced the agreement by the schools
to play a home—and-home series from
1997 to 2000. The first game will be Sept.
6, 1997 at Penn State's Beaver Stadium.

“(Tarman) and I have talked about
games beyond 2000, and trying to make
sure our schedules blend so that we have
a September date that would be suitable
for both universities to continue to play
on a home and home basis."

They have no official plans to continue
beyond 2000.

The series was nearing its end, with no
games scheduled after the November 21
at Beaver Stadium this season. The four
year break will be the first time since 1934
that the two teams will not play.

“Between now and four years from
now, games and contracts had been signed
and when they couldn't get together on a
September date,” Jaynes said. “I really
can't comment (on past negotiations to
keep the series going). That's all in the
past and there's no reason to even
comment on it. It’s unfortunate that we're
out for four years. It has not been easy for
both Penn State and Pitt to clear our
schedules so we could come up with a

common date. We've had to move a game
already to accommodate.”

Pitt reportedly was rejected in attempts
at signing a new deal, with Penn State
officials saying they couldn't fit the
Panthers into their schedule. Nittany Lion
coach Joe Paterno was rumored to be
behind the end of the series.

“I haven't had any discussions with
coach Paterno. He was certainly not against
the possibility of playing (the game),"
Jaynes said. “With the way the schedules
are ...the game will have to be played in
September. From a coaching standpoint,
I think that was a concern early on in
discussions, when they couldn't get
together on a date.”

The difficulty came about with Penn

State starting to play a Big Ten schedule
next season, forcing the game into
September; Having such a game so early
in the season may have been a concern
for both coaches, according to Jaynes.

“I've talked to coach Hackett,” Jaynes.

said, “He’s like any coach, and probably
coach Paterno feels the same way, you’re
always concerned who you play. I think
they both realize the importance of the
game.”

Hackett apparently cares more for
playing the game than when it_will be
played. ’

“I am thrilled,” Hackett said, “This is a
great development for all parties
concerned, but most importantly I am

Recruitng _

Pitt tennis

By Laini Samuels
For the Pitt News

Three women’s tennis
recruits and two men’s
recruits will help create
what coach George
Dieffenbach calls a positive
outlook for the 1992-93
season.

The women are coming
off an 11-11 year. They are
losing two graduating
seniors, Chis Orie and.
Michelle Rohm.
Dieffenbach has brought
in Jamie Cigler out of Mt.
Pleasant, PA, Alison Baker
from Williamsport, PA, and
Marla Zielinski from West
Pittson, PA to fill the holes
left by Orie and Rohm.

“The 92-93 season will
be a building year for the
women’s team. Idon’t want
to make any specific
comments yet but we're
looking for at least a .500
season,” said Dieffenbach.

The women’s team
returns five senior letter
winners from the 91-92
season. Erika Devins, Julie
LoPrinzi, Barbara McCarthy,
Josanne Neiswenter, and
Cheryl Sheppard are poised
to lead this year’s lady
panthers to a promising
season. They are part of
the positive outlook
described by Dieffenbach.

Juniors David Ginder
and Matt Dellinger and
seniors Jeff Campbell and
Glenn Hirsh return for the
men’s team this season.
Leaving the men’s squad
with three varsity letters
each are Larry Garrard,Joel
Orth andJohn Tegano. Last
year they were part of a
men’s team with a 12-10
record.

“We lost three senior
letter winners this year and
that should leave us with a
building year for the men’s
team too," said
Dieffenbach.

Jaynes’s sarcastic—yet—telling
commentary echoes both the
pain and increasing pleasure he
has endured following his May
28 heart surgery. _

“If you’ve ever had a broken
rib —— it's one of the mostpainful
injuries that you can have, ” Jaynes
said. “But to recover and be able
to breathe and cough again A—
that's a wonderful feeling.”

Entering his second full year in
Oakland, Jaynes has recently
returned to his post as chief
administrator of Pitt athletics
following his recovery from major
heart surgery. The triple—bypass
procedure sidelined the 1962
graduate of Appalachian State
for a solid six weeks  but no
longer.

‘Steadfast on the road to
recovery and back to work,
Jaynes admitted that while the

trauma around his scarred heart
region was “a bit suffocating”
following surgery, it wasn't the

source for his biggest discomfort.

That dubious honor went to his
right leg, which_was opened to
provide arteries which were
transferred to his ailing heart.
“My leg probably bothered me
more thanrmy chest, " Jaynes said,
leaning hi-s chair back in his Pitt
Stadium office. “You feel like you
almost had your leg cut off."
"Jaynes felt the circumstances
that led to surgery were threefold:
lack of exercise, heredity and
poor diet. In the 40 days prior to
being admitted for observation,
Jaynes attended 35 social
functions and dinners away from
home. He also worked 15-hour

‘days. Along with the sometimes

brutal Pittsburgh winter, which
makes for a slippery uphill trek to
the‘ Fitzgerald Field House track
—— and a reason not to exercise--S
the poor-diet/no-exercise
combination did little to help the
Pitt athletic director's health status.

Steelers training camp all smiles...for now

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Steelers inside linebacker
Hardy Nickerson’s smiling face
was the embodiment of the mood
at the opening of the team’s
training camp last week.

Nickerson is rumored to want
out of Pittsburgh after coming to
a dissatisfying contract agreement
with the team this off-season. His
desire to leave is strong enough
that he skipped workouts and
the first mimi-camp, while selling
his home in Pittsburgh. He
seemed slated for the bench with
Pro Bowler Greg Lloyd moving
inside along with David Little.

Still, Nickerson was all smiles
at camp. The question marks are
left on the sidelines, for now.

“It’s like a breath of fresh air to
have a new coaching staff,”
quarterback Bubby Brister said.

“As a team, we sense that we
are taking off like we did two

years ago,” fullback Merril Hoge
said.

New head coach Bill Cowher
and his staff are still in the
honeymoon stage of their era. As
with Nickerson, there are plenty
of concerns.

“Our offensive line, we've
created some competition there,”
Cowher said. “Wide receiver (is
undecided). Another position is
defensive line. I think we’ve been
able to acquire some talent in
some of those areas that could
create some competitive
situations.”

Question number one is the
choosing of a starting quarterback.
Seven-year veteran Brister, with
his questionable knee, and third-
year—man Neil O'Donnell are
apparently entering camp with
even shots at the starting job.

“(I’m looking at it) with an
open mind. We'll let how they
perform on the field dictate that,”

Cowher said. “They both really

 

have performed very well in the
past. They have both been proven
winners, but neither (has played
at) a consistent level that we're
looking for. We are coming into
a new system, so it is hard to pre-
judge them from the past system.
I think both of them have a good
grasp of what we are asking them
to do, now we have to see how
they apply it to the field.”

Both quarterbacks were asked, ‘

“Who's the man?

“I’m the man,” Brister said.

“I believe I am, Bubby believes
he is,” O'Donnell said.

Which one fits into the scheme
of new offensive coordinator Ron
Erhardt will be a key in that
decision. O'Donnell said he is
comfortable in the new system,
but that he also felt comfortable
with former offensive coordinator
Joe Walton's offense. Brister, who
never embraced the complex

‘Walton system, seems much more

comfortable with Erhardt.

 

“You start executing and not
thinking about where you are
going and what you are doing
and you have a better chance to
win,” Brister said, “The new
system is simplified a little bit and
we're looking forward to
executing and winning some
games.”

“It’s similar to what we used to
do when (former offensive
coordinator) T om (Moore) was
here. The protections are the same
and the blitz controls are the
same, so I'm pretty comfortable
with that stuff. First and second
downs, if we're not running it at
them, we're going to be throwing
it upfield...I think a strong arm is
going to be needed. I have one.”

Another player who could
benefit from the nevi; offense is
Hoge, the team’s leading msher

‘three of the last four seasons.
Like Brister, he was a player on
the rise before his production fell

EX—Panther
coach now
With pros

By Brandy L. Simms
Staﬂ‘ Writer’

Marvin Lewis remembers
the moment when he knew
that he wanted to become a
football coach. It was during
the spring break of his
sophomore year in college.

“When I was returning
home from here in
Pittsburgh to Idaho State,”
he says, “I decided on the
long drive back that that’s
what I wanted to do.”

The McDonald, Pa. native
began his career at Idaho

State where he coached the ‘

linebackers for four seasons
(1981-84). From there he
moved on to Long Beach
State and had a stint with
New Mexico before landing
a job at Pitt in 1990.

As the Panthers’ outside
_linebackers coach, Lewis
was responsible for molding
the talents of players like
Ricardo McDonald, Curtis
Bray, and Nelson Walker.
McDonald was a fourth
round selection of‘the
Cincinnati Bengals this year.
Walker signed with the
Toronto Argonauts of the
Canadian Football League.

Lewis, once again", is ready
for a new challenge. After
12 years of coaching on the
collegiate level, he begins
his first season as an NFL
assistant this fall. As a
member of new coach Bill
Cowher’s staff, Lewis has
the responsibility of
coaching the Pittsburgh
Steelers’ linebacking unit.

As one might expect,
Lewis can already see some
major differences between
the college and professional
football player.

“I think the biggest
difference thatI can see right
now is the preparation time
that these guys are able to
spend,” Lewis said, “I mean,
this is their profession. This
is their career and they’re
able to spend more time
and their approach to it is as
that—it’s their career. [Pro
playersl pay more attention
to the details of things.” _

During the 1970’s the
Steelers linebacking corps
included the likes of jack

Ham and Jack Lambert. The I

’92 version has some talented
players as well. Hardy
Nickerson, Bryan Hinkle,
jerrol Williams and Pro
Bowler Greg Lloyd among
them.

Lloyd, Lewis says, is
“probably one of the most
talented guys I’ve been
around.”

“He’s tremendously
talented physically,” says
Lewis. “He’s a very
aggressive player who has
excellent athletic ability,‘ [he] I
has a good feel for the game
of football and pays attention

LeMond drops out of Tour de France

By Robert Penman
Stajf Wﬁter

The largest single 5 portin g event
in the world occurs during the
month of July. Much money is
spent on, and much media
coverage is invested in, a month-
long trek in which 150 men
attached to bicycles are cheered
along by millions of usually docile
French nationals transmogrified
into crazed maniacs who ﬂank
the courses path.

This is the Tour de France, an
annual event that showcases the

world's greatest cyclists. These‘

athletes have to ride hundreds of
miles to survive this gauntlet—in
the mid—July sun —— over ﬂat corn
fields, attacking the altitude and
inclines of the Alpine mountain
range and competing against the
clock minus the help and aid of
teammates.

This is an event that requires
everything of its competitors.
Brute strength and stamina are
needed to deal with inclines or a
stage that might be 160 miles

long and requires the riders to
stay clamped onto their machines
for eight-plus hours. Mental
discipline and intelligence are
required in order to utilize each
stage of the Tour to the individual
riders’ strengths. And finally, they
need fortitude. An average Tour
has a 50—percent attrition
rate.

The Tour also carries one of
the dominant American athletes
of the past five years. No, Michael
Jordan doesn’t ride on the Tour
during the off season. It is three-
time winner Greg LeMond, who
rides on the French Z Team.

This year’s Tour of 21 stages
had its traditional start in San
Sebastion, Spain, and traversed
the southwest portion of France.
Ignoring Normandy and points
east, the Tour moves outside of
Paris and makes its way into
Belgium and Luxembourg. The
Tour will brieﬂy touch eastern
Italy and then make its way back
to Paris, ﬁnishing on the Champs
Elysee.

This Tour has been dominated

by former champions: Miguel
Indurian held the yellow jersey
(given to the overall leader) for
the first-stage time trial in the
Basque section of his native Spain.
Then Pascal Lino of France held
the yellow for several stages.
During this time, LeMond hovered
around the top 10 and seemed to
be making incremental progress
toward the lead. Also, 1985 champ
Steven Roche (bf Ireland, whose
Celtic soul seemed to cancel out
the fact that he is well past his
prime, managed tostay within
the top five.

But then the longest of the time
trials came. Lino, who admits to
the fact that the time trial is the
worst part of his game, faltered.
LeMond, who raps just the
opposite (in 1990, a late time trial
outside Paris made all the
difference in beating Laurent
Fingon by the smallest victory
margin in race history), gained
ground along with Indurian and
Italian Claudio Chiappucci,

Then came the Alps and the
end of LeMond. He quit, citing a

lack of energy (the same problem
at the same time last year quelled
his bid for a third-straight victory)
and a bad knee -— the ultimate
fear of any cyclist.

Although the end of LeMond’s
run just about snuffed American
hopes for yellow, Andy Hampsten
of team Motorola moved up,
taking fifth in stage 15 from St-
Gervais to Sestrire. Indurian
regained the yellow, and
Chlappucci placed first in the
stage. This was where LeMond,
who had been within 5 1/2
minutes, dropped 50 minutes
behind the leaders. Roche also
lost considerable ground and
remains a distant 10th, 18 minutes
behind. I

‘The Tour is now in its 15th
stage in St Etienne. Miguel
Indurian, the lifelong member of
Team Banesto, finished 15th and
still retains the yellow by a 1-
minute-41-second margin. Fellow
youngster Chiappucci is his one
and only competitor left.
Hampsten has a solid hold on
third place.

winter.”

Finally, after returning from the
Big East Meeting on the Sunday
of Memorial Day weekend,Jaynes
was feeling horrible and asked
his wife, Priscilla, to take him to
the hospital. Just four days later,
the triple-bypass was performed.

Following his Sunday night/
Monday morning visit to the
emergency room of Montefiore
Hospital, ]aynes’s journey to his
triple bypass went as follows.
jaynes was admitted early
Memorial Day morning to
Presbyterian Hospital for
observation. He took a stress test
that detected blockage around
the heart on Tuesday. On
Wednesday, he underwent
catheterization to expose further
blockage and decided on surgery
rather than medicine and rest. He
underwent surgery Thursday
morning.

The timing and severity of the

THE PI'I'l‘ NEWS, Wednesday, July 22, 1992

procedure surprised jaynes.

“l’ve never been into a
hospital, ”Jaynes said. “In 52 years
of married life, it was the first
time I’ve felt sick enough [to
warrant a hospital visitl.”

The anything-but—enjoyable
week of surgery —— along with
the discomfort that ensued —
was enough to convince Jaynes
that staying in good shape and
eating right were important. As
was avoiding 15-hour workdays.

Other than that, Jaynes admits
not much has changed. His
outlook on life has remained the
same and, within a another month
or so, he plans to be back to
normal  save for one of his
favorite hobbies.

“If anything, it messed up my
golf game for the rest of the
summer,” Jaynes joked.

Jaynes admitted he was
thankful for being in Pittsburgh
close to a campus that was next
door to world—class medical

 

facilities. He wentso far as calling
it “maybe one of the greatest
things that ever happened in my
life.”

“Had I been in Fort
Collins, Colorado,  I know there
is no way that their medical
facilities would compare to what
we have here at the University of
Pittsburgh. 1 can’t imagine being
in a better place [for medicinel,”
Jaynes said.

With the brunt of his recovery
behind him, Jaynes is focusing
on the future  and continuing
the work he started last year. His
top administrative priorities for
the coming year include
restructuring funding of the
athletic department as well as a
inquiring into the effectiveness
of Panther athletics.

“We need to look into our own
program and continue to improve
on making the administrative side
of athletics ‘as efficient as
possible,” jaynes said.

Jaynes could not point to one
thing that got the negotiations
going again.

‘‘I don't know whether there

agreement between (Tarman) and
myself. There was a mutual
agreement between the two of us
‘Let’s get together. Let’s talk. Let’s
put all these things behind us and
do what is best for college football
in the state of Pennsylvania.”

Jaynes stressed the reasons for
renewing the series.

“This game has been very
important for many people
throughout the state of
Pennsylvania — students, alumni,
and fans,” Jaynes said, “With the
formation of the Big East
Conference and Penn State’s

entrance into the Big Ten

Conference, finding a suitable
date was difficult. But, we are
delighted to have Penn State back
on our schedule.”

Jaynes said the time off won’t
take the excitement out of the
series. .

“I think the [Pitt-Penn State]
game will always be a big game,
regardless of what conferences
we belong to or what we do,”
Jaynes said.

off during the years under Joe
Walton. The Erhardt system is
built around a steady, workhorse
back like Otis Anderson was for
the Giants.

“I think (I can ﬁll that role),”
Hoge said, “There is opportunity
to do that, now it is up to me to
capitalize on that. There is
definitely opportunity for us to
run the ball, that’s what (Erhardt)
is going to do, now it’s about
making it happen.” I -

Barry Foster will probably start
along with Hoge after a gaining
488 yards last season despite
missing time with an ankle injury.

play, despite missing the
beginning of training camp, he
could also be the featured back.

Warren Williams returns as the
back-up after nearly leaving as~a

_ Plan B free agent. Seventh round

draft pick Scottie Graham could
be a key addition to the backﬁeld.

He is a stocky power runner with ‘

decent speed who could
challenge for time at fullback.
Second-year man Leroy
Thompson, tenth-round pick
Mike Saunders, and free agent
pick-up will challenge for a spot
on the bench.

_ The real key to Erhardt’s
success with the New York Giants
was his group of “road graders,”
his term for big, straight ahead
blocking offensive linemen.

“(It is) not a lot of trapping, just
straight ahead, power football,”
said center Dermontti Dawson
of the new blocking schemes,
“That’s what a lineman is for.”

Dawson is one of three well-
entrenched starters along with
left tackle John Jackson and right
guard Carlton Haeselrig, all about
290 pounds. Plan B addition
Duval Love, a 305-pounder from
the Rams, is penciled in at the left
guard spot.

Top draft pick Leon Searcy

undersized Tunch Ilkin at right

Lewis expresses optimism for
the ’92 linebacking unit. “It’s an
athletic group lthat’s] very
conscientious in their learning
and their assignments,” he says,
“As a coaching staff we're pretty
excited about the guys in our
linebacker corps.”

As a Panther assistant, Lewis
had the opportunity to work
under Paul Hackett who gained a
reputation as a solid offensive
coach. His new boss, Cowher,
has built a reputation as a
defensive coach but he sees some
similarities between both men.

“The difference I think being
right now between Bill and Paul
is basically Paul’s experience was

on offense and Bill’s been with -

defense and both of them were

parts as a head coach,” Lewis

Andrew Scott Baldwin, a
student-athlete, was acquitted by
reason of insanity of a Jan. 18
attack on Gina Simanek Mountain
in front of her house.

John and Kristin Walters
witnessed the attack after
returning from a basketball game.
John Walters, an ex-policeman,
said Baldwin’s actions didn’tseem
very rational.

Kristin Walters said that after
Baldwin picked up Mountain on
the front steps of her house, he
carried her to a car parked nearby
and threwher at the car.

Baldwin then removed his
clothes, picked up Mountain
and began carrying her by her
knees, upside down, to the
house, she said. He began
“bashing her head against the
sidewalk” about five to 10 times,
dropping her when the police

Danny Felker, assistant director

certain” a Subway will also be in
place. \‘

In addition to the Taco Bell,
Dunkin’ Donuts and Subway,
Felker said that MSU has talked

_ with Kentucky Fried Chicken

' also said there is an excellent
