Solution,’ Fisher States

The problem of “inadequate parking facilities" came un-

Assn. William G. Fisher, director of the Physical Plant "re-
pdrted that “there is no immediate solution” for this nuisance.

Fisher mentioned that it wouldcostnabout $2,000 per car.

space ,to_build.a parking garage and each car would have_to

bring in a dollar'a~ day to makeo

it worthwhile.

“Commercial garages,” he said.
“aren’t interested because they
operate on a quick turnover in
parking while most students stay
the entire day.

“The proposed Natural Sci-
ences building will take\ up most
of the parking lot behind Clapp_
Hall,” Fisher stated, “but, there

~. will be limited parking avail-

graduateustudents beneath the
building.”

When asked about the proposed
closing of Bigelow Boulevard, he
replied, “no plans. as yet have
been made because traffic is still
very heavy.” - _ ‘

In other reports givenat the
meeting it was announced that
applications are being accepted
for chairmanships of the Social

 Carver for A. D.

The last notice concerning the search for a new athletic
director said no successor to Tom Hamilton would be named
before the end of the current football season. The reasoning
behind this is that university officials feel it is unfair to
approach any candidate for the position during the hot and‘
’ heavy football season. I
There is ‘one man, however —— perhaps the Candidate
. best suited for the job — who could be approached without

 “worrying about his present capacity in-relation to the foot-

ball season. ,
That man is Frank Carver, currently graduate manager

‘C ‘V of athletics and acting athletic director here. Carver was the
first ;.man mentioned as a possible successor to Hamilton

when the later ‘resigned during the summer.

Immediately, in order to halt anythinking in that direc-
tion ‘before it got too far, Carver announced that he was
happy with his present position and that he was not inter-
ested in becoming athletic director.

Thus ended any pgssible move~to place Carver in the

0 it post. -The search committee, appointed by Chancellor Litch—

ﬁeld to ‘prepare a list of possible successors to Hamilton,

 i-nevertheless included Carve\r’s ‘name, among the “ﬁnalists.”'

There is no doubt as to Carver’s ability for the job.

a ‘He has been a Pitt man since the 1920’s. While doing under-

-graduate work here, he was a student helper in the athletic
department. Then, after graduating in‘l931, he became head .
of athletic publicity, and later took the post of graduate
manager. . ,

Once before this year, in 1948, Carver served as‘ acting
athletic'directoi'. Hamilton always spoke highly of Carver.
Before the Captain‘ left he told what an important aid
Carver had been to him in histen-year stay here.

ﬁlling the post of athletic director. The university should
. forget about trying to bring someone here from finother
, school. It has been unusual with the administration to select
' a P_itt_man when a job is vacant, but this is one instance

 when they should break this unwritten rule. 0

Those whose job itis to select the new director should
channel their-energies in the direction of persuading Carver
.to take the job. We do not mean .that the selectors should
go extremely far out of their way to do this, but a little

’ talking can often produce results. .

_ On the other hand, acting director Carver should seri-1
ousley reconsider his stand and let it be known that he
would accept the job if it were offered to him. ;,Then the
university could go through the formality of making the
offer, Carver could accept it and we would have an athletic
-director who would do as capable a job as anyone the uni-

varsity may import.

Wanna Bet? . . .

C-o-Broke-Quick Scheme

By John Lowenthal

A word to the wise about an unwise practice:

-a lot of students are spending a remarkable

amount of money on a remarkably wasteful form
of “entertainment”: football parlay or pool cards.

There is nothing wrong with placing a harm-
less wager, or even a whopping big wager, on a
game, if it is a reasonable shot. But there is some-
thing very wrong with a wager which appears to

be fair game but which is really as crooked as at

Psych 8 rat maze. 1

Suppose somebody offered to ﬂip coins‘ with you
if you spotted him 16-9 odds on the ﬂip. You ﬂip
100 times at these odds and win, of course, about
50 ﬂips. But, at a dollar a ﬂip, you have lost $350
by breaking even. The reason is obvious: when
you ﬂip coins, the bet should be even money, not
16-9 against you, because you have an even, not a

, 16-9 chance of winning your bet.

As far as we are concerned, there is one solution to ‘

  
 
  

Stacked Odds_ “

The football pool cards are similarly stacked
against you. The cards say that if you pick four
winners in four picks, the.’ payoff is 9-1. But re-
member, your chance on each game is exactly even

money because of the point _spread. The top ex--

perts in the country makeup this point spread so

that the games are each an’ even-money pick.
Certainly you cannot hope to consistently out-

guess the professional oddsmakers. Now the odds

 

against your winning four straight even—money
bets is the same as the odds against younﬁipping
four heads in a row: 16-]. But the payoff is only
9-1. '

What this means "in effect is that you must
play the pool cards for 16 weeks. at one dollar a
week in order to get one nine dollar payoff. Net
result of 16 weeks play: a loss of seven dollars. A

fair parlay card would offer at least a 14-1 payoff ' ’
on four

teams. But parlay cards are not fair
betting. They are an out and o.ut racket.

From 1048 -to I50-l

When you play more than four teams the odds
against you get even worse. The true odds against
you on ten teams, for instance, is 1048-1, but the
common payoff is only 150-1‘. Playing ‘ten teams

is therefore just like spotting 7-1 odds on the flip

of a coin, a proposition which this writer will be
happy to accept if any reader wants to try. A
The payoff record of the -card operators cer-

\

la‘-

tainly illustrates the mathematical odds in their-
favor. Last year, when operators onvthe" cainpuseﬁ

of a large state university we1'e investigated, they
admitted that they paid out only $175 for each
$1,000 taken in.

Convocation Audience
, Editor, the Pitt’ News:

Last Wednesday morning I
went to the sixth floor reference
room at 9:30 a.m.i to study for
about an hour before I was to
run over to the Memorial to hear
the Chancellor speak at Fall
Convocation. » " ‘

But after what happened I
wouldn’t*‘ have gone there for
anything. At 10 a.m., all of us
working in the room were told
that we would have to -get out.
I, walked down to the fifth floor
and saw- students being driven
out of these -rooms too.

The same scene‘ was taking '
place throughout the , Cathedral 0'

Shop. Even the Hunt Room was
closed down.
Someone had obviously want-

ed to insure a good turnout for, V

the Convocation. I know our
chancellor could have had noth-
ing -to do with closing down the
Cathedral. He is not crude.

Its author must have been
some eager administrator who
takes the word “convocation” at
its literal meaning.

I address these words to him;
If you insist upon mocking the
wonderful ceremony of Fall‘
Convocation and the people who

 ‘Economics Major
 /Factor,’ Says Bowles

. B.V LES ROTHENBERG
Leaders in American industry should return to college
every ﬁveior eight years for a refresher course in economics,
according to Congressman Chester Bowles of Connecticut.

 

Bowles, who has previously served as ambassador to
.‘ India, OPA Administrator and Governor of Connecticut, ar-

rived in Pittsburgh Monday to present the ﬁrst of a series of

Survival which are concerned
‘with new directions in foreign af-
fairs. _

chambers of Pittsburgh Mayor

Thomas Gallagher, Congressman

.,Bow1es discussed various problems

of both national and local im-
portance. ' -
Enterprise Needed

“I don’t think there is anything

 
   
   
  

marked-Bowles, “that a good dose
I of private, competitive enterprise
couldn’t cure.”

Bowles feels that the aim of
American manufacturing should
,’be' a maximum expansion of
 volume with a modest proﬁt. In
I ,regard to furthering this idea,
_ he stated: “I-think it would be

‘a good" idea for everyone in-
volved to _go back to school’
every ﬁve or eight years and
_ study the latest developments in
' _ economic theory.” ,
Delving into the_ current steel

situation which . has effected. the
daily lives of almost every Pitts-
burgher, the former/' Indian am-
bassador said, “The current price
of our steel per ton is pretty ex-
‘~ pensive!” ~

 

Price Tripled
' -“When I was in the Office of
Price,Administration in 1945, the
price of U.S. steel was $54 a ton.
' ’Today the price has reached $155
a ton,’ or a triple increase since

  
   
   

discussions entitled The Shape of!) -~

.At a press conference in the-

wrong- with our economy,” re-"

the Second World War."

-“I recommended to the Presi-
dent last July that the rapid in-
crease in productivity should
lead to lower prices. I felt that
the steel companies have kept
the wages at the same rate and
lowered the price of steel at
least ten dollars a ton.”

Bowles pointed to the fact that
while our national economy ‘was
now increasing less than two per-
cent annually, the Soviet economy

is. growing at the rate of eight
percent.

“These are the facts Mr.
Khrushchev was looking at
when he laid down the chal-
lenge of Soviet economic pros-'
perity just a £ew weeks ago.”

“Therefore, we must act‘ im— .

mediately by striving for these
three objectives: I
“First, we must learn how to
expand our economy by four 6:
ﬁve percent each year without
causing inﬂations Secondly, we
must tackle a much more rapid
pace on racial discrimination, and

~ﬁnally, we must take a new, hard

look at our foreign policies. an
area inwhich we have made ser-
ious,mistakes in the _past.”
