Controversy surrounds construction of new telescope

By Julie Sabol

News Editor

Students and environmental groups have
expressed outrage, anger and concern
over the possibility of Pitt becoming
involved in a project they said would be
breaking environmental laws and harming
endangered species.

The University of Arizona—sponsored
Columbus Project involves the building of
three telescopes on an Arizona mountain,
Mt. Graham. The telescopes would be the
largest in the world and would make it

possible to see much more of outer space
than is currently possible.

The controversy is not with the
telescopes themselves but with their
location. Though the Friends of Mt. Graham
environmental group said laws would be
broken and the mountain would suffer
greatly from the project, representatives
of the project from the University of
Arizona said these statements are not true.

The Friends of Mt. Graham argue that
Mt. Graham is a sacred religious mountain
to the San Carlos Apache tribe, the home
of the endangered red squirrel and a very

important part of the ecological balance
of the area. These three factors are the
main objections to the construction of the
telescopes according to Roger
Featherstone, representative of Friends of
Mt. Graham.

Featherstone said it does not matter
how technologically beneficial the location
is. The environmental aspects, such as the
destruction of the land and disruption of

the ecological system of the mountain,

greatly outweigh the supposed benefits,
he said.
“Pitt cannot afford the stigma of being

party to this project,” Featherstone said.
However both Pitt and Arizona
professors involved in the project disagreed
with many of Featherstone’s comments.
“All of what [Featherstonel says is very
interesting. The University of Pittsburgh
definitely has a deep and abiding interest
in the preservation of ecological systems,"
George Gatewood, Pitt astronomy
professor and director of Allegheny County
Observatory, said.
“It’s not our intent to endanger any
species or violate the rights of any group.

Budget Policies Committee to implement new systemt

By Renee Crespy
Recruiting Coordinator

A subcommittee of the Senate
Budget Policies Committee is
currently working on a new
system that will involve input
from all faculty, staff, students
and administration in the
decision—making processes
concerning academic and budget
policies at Pitt. ,

Implementation of the system

is presently underway, and
members of the BPC are working
to revise and improve it so it can
be fully integrated by 1994.
One of the system’s main goals
is to transform Pitt’s decision-
making process into one that
involves everyone it will affect.
“It is a system that will allow all
(faculty, staff, students and
administration] to openly discuss
where and why we ought to spend

the revenue we have,” Edward
C‘

Symons, co-chairperson of the
BPC, said.

“Take for instance the proposed
new university library. Everyone
should have input on what should
go into it, what books we need
and what services it will provide
for research,” Symons said. “You
can’t have an isolated decision
on these things.” '

Isolated decisions were what
caused the last system to fail,
according to Symons and Phil

The University Faculty
Assembly voted to change the
Senate bylaws which govern the
University Senate’s actions at its
monthly meeting yesterday
afternoon.

The Organization and
Procedures committee has been

""Working on revising the bylaws

for at least three years, according
to committee Chair Allen Janis.

The proposal for revised
Senate bylaws states that “the
most significant change is in the
way that faculty become
members of Senate Council.”
Each faculty member elected to
serve a three-year term on the
FA would spend the first year
solely on FA and the last two
years as members of both FA
and Senate Council.

There will also be additions of
three staff members to the Senate
Council, and an additional
standing committee, the Non-
Discrirninatory Policy committee.

The responsibility for
monitoring attendance was also
changed by the FA. The
responsibility will be shifted from
the elections committee to the
executive committee.

“I think [the new revisions]
will make an improvement in

the operations of the senate,”.

Janis said.
Though the change in the

The last system, Planning

System, was in effect when
Wesley Posvar was still in office.
“He formed the PRMS, but by the
time they had their committees
together Posvar was out the door,”
Symons said. ‘ _

“PRMS was theoretically
designed to engage in open
discussions, but it had flaws.

bylaws was the focus of the
meeting, the proposal of an
undergraduate business school
was also discussed.

The FA has organized a seven-
member committee to make a
recommendation on the proposal.

Senate Council President
Richard Tobias said, “It’s a bad
policy to have an undergraduate
business school, and [the
proposal] has been severely
criticized."

Reasons for the criticism is a
lack of sufficient office and
classroom space, according to
Tobias.

He said that the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences and the Provost’s
Advisory Committee on
Undergraduate Programs have
already made recommendations
against the new business school.
According to Tobias, the business
school has made no amendments
to its proposal since it first became
criticized.

‘‘I’m not happy that they have
not listened to this criticism,”
Tobias said.

Yeakle upsets Singel unexpectedly in PA senate primary

By Jason Hillman
Managing Editor

In the biggest surprise of the
Pennsylvania political season,
Lynn Yeakel defeated Lt.
Governor Mark Singel in the
dernoctiatic primary for the tjnited
States Senate seat Currently held
by Arlen Specter.

Yeakel, who has never run for
political office before, is known
mostly for her fundraising activity
and was considered an underdog
by many.

Though she was behind in
earlier polls, she overcame
Singel’s lead in later voter surveys.

“People say she came from
nowhere, but she came from the
community where she has been
solving problems and finding
solutions. She’s a new voice,”
Yeakel’s press secretary Catherine
Ormerod said.

Yeakel said that Specter’s
interrogation of Anita Hill was
one of the main reasons she
decided to run, according to Wye

“It will be an issue—driven
campaign,” Ormerod said. “We
will be holding Specter
accountable for his record.”
“We think the people
responded to Yeakel’s message,
which is one ofchange, a message

of bringing a new kind of

experience to politics. 'l'liey heard
her message and responded
overwhelmingly,” Ormerod said.

Other than the Yeakel-Singel
surprise, all of the other primary
races resulted as expected.

In the Presidential race,
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
won the Pennsylvania democratic
primary with 57 percent of the
vote.

Former California governor
Jerry Brown took 26 percent.

With 77 percent, George Bush
easily won the Republican
primary, earning him enough
delegates to lock up the
nomination.

Ron Klink, former KDKA-TV
news anchor, won the democratic
primary in the fourth District,
while Frank Pecora won in the
18th District.

Republican candidates Gordon
Johnston of the fourth and Rick
Santorum of the ‘18th both ran
unopposed.

Pitt Professor Marick Masters,
who also ran in the 18th district,
finished seventh in a field of 12
candidates.

‘‘I actually was pleased with
my finish, as a newcomer without
a base of support. I garnered
7,000 votes in a highly competitive
district,” Masters said.

Masters said redistricting, which
did not take effect until the middle
of_March, had an effect on the
primary.

“There was a lot of uncertainty
about the makeup of the new
18th Congressional District. I think
that hinders candidates who are
trying to build a base and helps

Masters said. “All in all, it’s a fair

Masters found that his biggest
challenge during the. race ‘was
trying to get name recognition

“My basic approach was to use
the media in such the short period

Editor-in-Chief

America suffers from societal
impotence brought on by
politeness and fear of offense,
according to john Frohnmayer,
former head of the National
Endowment for the Arts. “l\X/el
don’t confront signiﬁcant issues
of our time. \X/e’re losing the
DNA of common beliefs that
define what our society is,” he

, said Wednesday in the Benedum
‘Auditorium.

Often artists feel it is their duty
to bring these issues back into
the forefront ofAmerica, he said,
but not without backlash.
Frohnmayer was asked to resign
from his position as head of the
NEA earlier this year because of
pressure from fundamentalist

groups and politicians such as
Senator Jesse Helms and
presidential hopeful Pat
Buchanan. Among claims put
forward by these groups are that
the NEA has funded projects that
are blasphemous or
pornographic.

Frohnmayer disputed their
claims and said, “Arts have
become a whipping-boy, smear
campaign, fundraising
mechanism for lfundamentalists’l
own causes. They seek a
homogeneous America.”

Frohnmayer said such claims
prove that the First Amendment,
which protects free speech, is
working. He added that there are
no laws in this country prohibiting
what some would consider
blasphemy and that no major
religious leaders have commented

addition, no NEA-funded projects
have been ruled pornographic in
a court of law.

Frohnmayer said the groups
which have taken offense to NEA-
funded projects have done so
intentionally. “Those who are
outraged have not been insulted
with-unexpected intrusions, they
have sought them out,” he said.

An example Frohnmayer cited
was in a poem written about the
female jogger who was attacked
by a gang of wilding youths in
Central Park. The author, who
received an NBA grant, had
published the poem in a New

circulation of 5,000. Frohnmayer

Psycb proﬁ ma/ee beozltb discoveries

By Bruce Boul
Staﬂ” Writer

Six researchers from the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center are presenting their cutting-
edge psychiatric findings at the
American PsychiatricAssociation’s
Annual Meeting in Washington,
D.C., this week.

Among the distinguished
gathering of scientists is Walter
H. Kaye, M.D., an associate
professor of psychiatry. Kaye will
discuss the possible link of
anorexia nervosa to’ obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD).
According to Kaye, the inherent
nature of the illness anorexia tends
to be very obsessional.

“Patients with anorexia nervosa
share common characteristics with
OCD patients, including rigidity
and perfectionism,” Kaye said.

Kaye also said that recent
research on the brain chemical
serotonin shows that high levels
of the chemical produce obsessive
and anxious behavior which has

been linked to anorexia nervosa.

“We know more about
serotonin than any other chemical
in the body,” Kaye said, “and this
raises the possibility that
anorexics may respond to
serotonin—specific medications.”

Neal D. Ryan, M.D., also an
associate professor of psychiatry,
will address the “Psychobiology
of Child and Adolescent
Depression.” In his six years of
research he has found a strong
relationship, including similar
symptoms and characteristics,
between depression in children
and adolescents and depression
in adults.

According to Ryan, depression
not only affects academic and
social development of children
and adolescents but also
increases their risk of
experiencing serious problems
later in"life, including alcoholism,
antisocial behavior and suicide.
_ Duncan Clark, M.D., will
discuss “Anxiety Disorders in 30
Alcoholic Adolescents.” Clark

Metil said that in a conversation with

how the endorsement is a credit to the

The $50,000 will support the first full-

also offer students and faculty exchanges

with Slovakia. There are three to four

while two students from Bratislava are

The system was ﬁrst proposed by Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor, stemming from documents he
was faced with when he first came to Pitt.

The documents included the PRMS, an institutional

having to do with the topic ofbudget management

“O’Connor is willing to change to make a

to believe they have some say in their destiny at
the university,” Symons said.

The BPC will hold two hearings open to the

groups had obtained a copy and
declared the poem pornographic.

“A small number [of people]
have played this very effectively,”
he said. _

In response to arguments that
the arts can be funded by the
private sector without
government intervention,
Frohnmayer said that without
federal funding to lead the way it
would be impossible for non-
profit artists to work. He said
every government dollar brings
in $10 from the private sector, but
it is necessary for the government
to remain the catalyst.

He added that history shows
there has never been a civilized
society in which the government
did not fund the arts.

Frohnmayer said the United
States Congress has received more
mail concerning the NEA, ‘which
costs taxpayers 68 cents a’ year,
than the savings-and-loan crisis,
which will cost each American
$2,000.

. He said he believes part of the
anger taxpayers feel toward the
NEA stems from ignorance of the
issues. He said people who have
not experienced the art act on
information they receive from
other people who probably have

not experienced the art, either.

Frohnmayer said
controversy created by art is
mistakenly seen as negative by
the Bush administration. He said

the '

that controversy can be used to
positively‘ confront issues that
face American society.

“The arts are the soul  the
expression ofwhat society wants
to be,” he said.

By silencing such artists he
said America is stilling the First
Amendment, which he sees as
dangerous.‘

“It is very bad for a country
that reverses the First
Amendment,” he said.

Frohnmayer asked .the
question, can Americans be
forced to-fund art they find unsafe
or offensive? His answer" was
“Unequivocally yes.”

He argued strongly against .

content restrictions within the
NEA, explaining that artists are
subject to a strong review policy
already.

‘‘In arrogance or humility, the
artist speaks the truth,” he said.

F rohnmayer also reminded the
audience that fans greeted
Michelangelo’s David by

breaking its arm off.

In response to very specific

. criticism, Frohnmayer defended

Andre Ceranos’s Piss Christ,
which is a photograph of a
crucifix submerged in urine, by
asking the audience for a better

example of man’s inhumanity to
the son of god than by submerging
him in human waste.

“Offense is in the eye of the
beholder,” Frohnmayer said.

Frohnmayer said he is
concerned for the future of the
NEA. Currently, the NEA allows
all voices to be heard despite
racial or economic differences,
he said, but in the future that may
not be the case.

He said two possible blows the
NEA may suffer are complete
extinction and consecration to
the point where only projects that
are considered safe by everyone
will be funded.

On the practical side,
Frohnmayer said this can be
devastating because
copyrightable material is the
second largest export of the
United States, and the NEA serves
as the “farm club’’ for the industry.

Frohnmayer stressed the power
of art over the individual. “Any
child who has ever written a
poem or performed a song or
dance is forever changed,” he
said.

Frohnmayer spoke as part of
The American Experience Lecture
Series sponsored by the University
Honors College.

: California dreaming

A year ago in March of 1991, Los Angeles, the city of
angels, was shown to be a community where some
community members fear to tread. Rodney King became

' a symbol of violence directed at racial groups and other

marginal social groups. In many instances of racially
motivated violence, the police face the allegations instead
of an-eo-Nazis or skinheads.

A video camera captured blow after blow delivered by
four LA. police officers. But what appeared to be an
obvious act of police brutality was not enough to convict
the four accused officers on April 30 a year later.

At the center of the debate, L.A. law—enforcement

-officers defend-ed themselves against brutality charges."

Jurors were asked if the four accused officers overstepped
the bounds of standard operating procedures for L.A.’s

" finest.» These jurors answered that the four officers’ actions

were not outside the realm of normal procedure.

This is not surprising — the L.A. police department has
beencriticized for its brutality before. Complaints have
been registered by the anti—abortion group Operation

V Rescue, the American Civil Liberties Union and members

of racial, ethnic and lesbian and gay communities.

7 The trial was not centeredaround the procedure which

led to the violence but around whether theactions on
video exceeded the questionable guidelines of the L.A.
police department. A vindication of Rodney King was set

‘ to fail.

Accepting the officers’ actions as warranted, the jury’s

’ decision became a symbol of justice denied to African-

Americans as well as many other oppressed social groups.
An almost all—white jury in a white suburb further

‘demonstrated injustice. King’s civil suit and a pending

inve,st,i_gation ofcivil. 'I'lgfl'_1a[S‘Vv_\/.:l;C‘)_l?;.tlQ‘,I'1__S by the United States
Department of Justice may uproot the ‘cause of the
allegations of a bigoted LA.‘ police department. In the
meantime however the King trial produced no criminal
convictions. Frustration with the American justice system
should be seen as the spark for the riots which ensued.
‘Our naton’s legal system’s advocation of police brutality

E E has been billed as the spark for the mob violence in L.A.

In the media, a surprising number of African-American
and civil-rights leaders have appeared before the American
public and discussed issues impacting economically
disadvantaged communities. For the first time in many

‘years, issues regarding communities of color and

economically isolated communities have taken center
stage in the great American debate. At last the domestic
issue is here to stayflt is saddening that it took death,
senseless beating and mass violence to finally put inner-
city, racial, class and minority issues on the table in

1 American politics.

Letters

a shortsighted mudslinger who
is attending a university that only

AIDS quilt wouldh’t have died if  
the Animal Rights movement had been opposed,
that Animal Rights advocates are against AIDS
research and ‘against developing a cure for AIDS
and that scientists who work against AIDS are the
victims of “fear and intimidation” from Animal
Rights advocates. These charges are absurd l...l
What we do oppose is unnecessary testing and
experimentation, unnecessary cruelty and
unnecessary mistreatment of lab animals. And the
Animal Rights movement involves many other
animal—related issues besides biomedical research.
The inadequate efforts on behalf of AIDS
treatmentsand cures are in no way the fault of
Animal Rights supporters. .
Joseph Forbes

AIDS research not hindered by animal rights
Please set the record straight regarding the anti-
animal—rights ad in your newspaper March 51. The
ad featured a photo of the Names ProjectAIDS quilt
with the headline “How Many More Will Die Before
You Say No To The Animal Rights Movement?”

[T he] Names Project threatened the group that
sponsored the ad with legal action, whereupon this
group heeled and canceled its ad campaign.

The group is a front for U.S. Surgical, a
controversial Fortune 500 company which made
$834 million last year. Because [U.S. Surgical’sl big
seller is a surgical staple gun which l...l salespeople
demonstrate on living dogs, a_nimal—rights activists
have protested against [the company ...]

Animal—rights activists were smeared in the ad,
and Ingrid Newkirk of People for the "Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) was misquoted. We
have never believed animal research will lead to a
cure for AIDS, and we've cited numerous failed
animal tests which have siphoned millions of
dollars away from more productive clinical, in vitro
and epidemiological studies, as well as patient
care, education and prevention. PETA has had a
Gay & Lesbian Caucus since 1982 and was among
the first groups to march on Washington to demand
federal funds for AIDS ‘research.

Staff Writer, PETA

Sick of heterosexism
I am writing in response to unprofessional,
irrelevant and callous remarks which were recently

printed in The Pitt News [April 6, 1992]. These"
appeared in  sports section in an article by ‘

validates queer issues in two
ways: as a subtopic of “Cultural Diversity” and
through [an] (under)funded group of overworked
queer students. This unjversity’s _weak support for
groups that are discriminated against however will
not excuse Buncher for writing that hateful and
stupid crap or The Pitt News for printing it l...l‘

These uneducated remarks appear in a story
about the Steelers. Not only is this an example of
poor journalism on Buncher’s part, but it is also an
example of irresponsible editing. Buncher also
slams another section of 7bePitt News in his article.
.Now those who read Buncher’s column either hate
queers a little bit more, hate themselves a little bit
more or see 7bePz'ttNews as a little bit more foolish.

Ryan Buncher concludes his nasty sentiments by
declaring that he is “really sick of it [gay visibilityl.”
Let me tell you, Buncher, I am really sick of “it,” too.
I am really sick of heterosexism in our society, and
I am really sick of defending myself to spiteful
ignoramuses like you. But I’ll keep doing it because
I want to improve this university. That’s why I am
so vocal. Why are you?

Animal shelters offer grads a bundle of joy

As the senior class prepares to graduate, some
may be considering getting a pet as soon as they are
settled into their post-graduation lives.

I am writing this letter to remind students l...l to
consider adopting an animal from an animal
shelter rather than purchasing one from a pet
store.

Each purchase of an animal at a pet store is a
death sentence for an animal at a shelter.

The Humane Society of [America] estimates that
7.5 million unwanted dogs and cats are euthanized
each year in this country.

Many people seem to think that the animals in the
shelters are older, unhealthy rnutts. This simply is
not true. They often have puppies and kittens, and
you can usually find your favorite breed at a
shelter.

Very unhealthy or otherwise unadoptable animals
are usually euthanized as soon as they reach the
shelter. Please consider adopting an ‘animal from
your local shelter. And don't forget to have your
pets spayed or neutered.

I don’t know when or where
it’s going to end, but it has to —
Pittsburgh has always been too
isolated and unimportant to
receive treats in such a common
manner.

It’s riot time again as The

(bless them each night) rounds
out its avant-garde music series
Over The Edge III ' with a
spectacular showcase of jazzcore,
featuring that WestCoast,, San
Francisco thang of The Splatter
Trio and The Molecules.

As impressive as it is, it’s hard
to imagine that The Splatter T rio’s
debut LP on Rastascan Records is
the group’s first studio effort. But
with a lineup of Dave Barrett on
Sax, Myles Boisen on guitar/bass
doubleneck and Gino Robair on
percussion, it is evident exactly
what and why this group is going
on. The list of musicians they’ve
worked with is as impressive as
the recording itself. You name
‘em — Zorn, ROVA, Braxton --
they’ve gigged with ‘em, and they

Altman's The Player succeeds in scathing"HollyWoo?dﬂ l

By Alon Orstein
Staff Writer

Hollywood has always been the land of
contradiction. It is a world of debauchery
and debt finance, of stereotypes and shrimp
salads, of fax machines and “Fabulous!”

Like an outdated General Motors
assembly line, they churn it out with
gratuitous, Frito-Lay formula flicks where
the cars and women are fast and the lead
character is a recovering alcoholic (with a
chip on his shoulder) — feel-good, pie-in-
the-sky morality movies .that are so
outrageously unreal they deﬁr the laws of

pop fiction. Slap a happy face on “the ,

bitch.”

It is a paradox, one might say, how a
facility of such naughtiness and complexity
can continue to propagate such extreme
fluff. Still we manage to scarf the crap up
like Mickey D’s french fries and send the
biodegradable container back for more.
I’m living large these days, you know.

When I first heard about ThePlayerI was
working as an intern for producer David
Brown. He had the project in his stable,
mired in developmental hell, and though
all agreed the piece was excellent, no one
was sure if it wou1d.ﬂy.

Then Iheard the long-defunct Robert
Altman was on the task. Robert Altman! (I
did a double take.) Robert Altman!?

Now don’t get me wrong — I always
loved Altman, the tapestry of Nashville,
the gritty realism of McCabe andMrs. Miller,
M"A*S‘H and all that. Critics had wet
dreams about his progressive attack, and
his early stuff was being pored over_ from
the hallowed halls of New York University
to the back wood bungalows of Sundance,
Utah.

But the dude hadn't done anything in
years, at least not since Schoolhouse Rock
was in vogue and Charl2'e3Angels topped
the charts at Nielsen. He had just spiraled
into obscurity, one hand on the bottle, the

other clenching a flstful of flops I dare not
drudge back into the light for all our sakes.

And, for sure, Altman was no player. On
the contrary, helhad always been one of
Hollywood’s hardcases, a real non-
conformist, a Rodeo Drive rebel who
would punch out a Barry Diller or ajeffrey
Katzenburg just as soon as he’d do lunch
with him

And then I thought, yeah, who better to
do the job? Who better to take helm on
Michael Tolkin’s (7hePlaye1’s screenwriter)
tinseltown expose, to give a no—holds-
barred slant on the whole tainted enchilada?
The film opens on Griffin Mill (Tim
Robbins), a slick studio executive who
seems to have stepped right out of some
sushi den at Spago. He is listening to a
writer (Buck Henry) pitch a screenplay for
The Graduate PartII (the irony, one of the
film's fundamental jabs and beauties, is
that Henry wrote the original Graduate
script). Subsequently, we are propelled
into the pa geantry of the Hollywood scene,
a place where mineral water seems to ﬂow
from every tap and absurd story ideas
bounce back and forth between Armani
suits.

As the plot thickens, we see that Mi1l’s
situation isn’t really all that rosy. A young
hotshot exec has come over from another
studio and is positioning to bump him
from the starting lineup.» Even more
alarming, a fanatic screenwriter who he
once slighted has begun sending him
death threats: “In the name of all writers,
I’m going to kill you!”

Mi11’s status and state of mind slowly
degenerate and things start to get weirder.
In the meantime, a virtually unprecedented
stream of cameos (that makes ]FKlook like
Straight Outta Brooklyn) ﬂit across the
Hollywood veneer. Everyone from Harry

i Belafonte to Jayne Meadows, from Cher to

Peter Falk, from Alan Rudolph to Sally
Kellerman, etc., etc. One can’t help but be
a little 's_£ar—struck.

,. ea
Gino Robair, Dave Barrett and Myles Boisen of Splatter Trio get intricate at the Beehive May 10.

More central is Gretta Scacchi as the
mysterious woman to whom Mill gravitates.
Whoopi Goldberg plays the wise—cracking_
detective looking for a bust, and Lyle
Lovett of all people is a mysterious shadow
figure.

Forget about George Foreman, forget
about Jimmy Connors —— Altman is the
comeback kid. Across the board, 7hePlayer
sparkles with the bright intensity of the
Cali sun. Like some of its more noteworthy
predecessors (Day Of The Locust, Sunset
Boulevard, The Bad And The Beautiful),
The Player succeeds in portraying rniens
of the movie industry that both repulse
and fascinate.‘ Through this dark and
absorbing narrative, Tolkin weaves a
magnificent mesh of character and
environment that remains no more esoteric
than any hip-hop riff. He also succeeds in
conveying (in an utterly unabashed sense)
the real and everyday drama‘ of
this turbulent business and cultural
center.

Without a doubt it’s Robbins’ movie,
and he is at his best here. We feel his
transgressions and eventual deterioration.
We come to loathe his nasty persona yet,
at the same time, are compelled by a
certain air of vulnerability. It’s the classic
Altman ambivalence, lead characters with
all the negative trimmings (and I’m not
talking about Hemingway). In the days of
Patrick Swayze, Michael Douglas and
Steven Seagal, this is refreshing.

Also, notable are a whole host of ancillary
players falling into familiar business
caricatures. The puffed-up security guard
who reminisces about the good old days
when his father was a key grip; the robotic,
slave-driven secretary who holds
everything. together; the horny, V.I.P. sons 5
of East Coast investors; the oddball writers
watching old prints of 7heBz'cycle Yhieﬁ the
pushy intern; the genuine story editor ——
the -list goes on.

Lensing by Jean Lepine is solidlas well.

 

 

From a crane shot roaming across the
compound, to the interview with Henry
filmed through a partially veiled window,
we get the sense of being pulled
unnervingly close to the action. A reluctant
Peeping Tom, one might say, drawn into
the ﬂowery sundrenched lots where people
get screwed to the wall. Lepine keeps us
on edge through his jarring close—ups and

the shimmering sprawl of the Hollywood-

periphery.

The soundtrack is vintage Altman,
multilayered and rich with overlapping
dialogue. Unlike many of today's directors,

his editing and mixing techniques lend a - '

sort of credibility to the interaction, allowing
for a much more fluid and realistic

interchange in scenes with multiple

speaking parts. -
Question: Do they really get away with
murder out there in (as Jonathan Demme
affectionately refers to it) “La La Land?” Or
do universes like Altrnan’s “only exist in
the movies?” Will putting a smiley sticker
on the end of a piece of celluloid make
everything A—O.K.? Griffin Mill tells his
detractor that if he can “guarantee the
ending,” we will live happily ever after.
The truth according to Tolkin isrthat
there are no real heroes out there. L
Perhaps in this postmodern global
marketplace, McWorld, there is no room
for them. When the story editor petitions
the writer to stand up for his beliefs, she
loses her shoe and her job. That’s reality.
Pop-film trends, sabotaging a viable art
form for the sake of the almighty dollar,
substituting the innovative for the
tantalizingly familiar — that’s also reality.

In the days of Paul McCartney Visa ,,

commercials, who can really blame
anybody? It’s nice though when a film
comes around that lets us snap on all that’s
“wack” and, through satire, get at the guts
of what it is. .

But then again, it’s only a movie, and
Bruce Willis cananever really die.

The Pitt baseball Learn was
playing pi‘etty\vell yesterday; then
things turned ugly. The Panthers
got their second straight victory
4-2 over Villanova before the
rains "came, causing
postponement of the second
game of the scheduled double-
header. The Panthers will make it
up as part of a double-header
today against the Wildcats starting
at noon at Trees Field.

“I think we played well, the
kids played well,” Pitt head coach
Mark Jackson said. “We bunted
the ball well, Mickey Vincent
pitched a great game and Jason
Rakers did a really good job in
relief. I thought we played well..
The last game against
Georgetown we played well.
Hopefully, we can finish off the
season playing that way.”

The victory raised the Panthers’
record to 22-19 overall, 4-12 in
the Big East. The team will not be
in the Big EastTournament, which
only takes the top four teams in
the conference. ,

Pitt lost its first two games
against Georgetown this past
weekend before coming back to
win the last game of the series.
Despite the two straight wins, Pitt
has struggled through its

conference schedule. Connecticut V

took three games at Trees Field
April 17 and 18, and Seton Hall
did the same when they hosted
the Panthers April 12 and 15.
“We wish we could have done
better in the Big East," Jackson

said "We had high expectations, 8

but when you fall short of your
goals sometimes you are a little
frustrated and disappointed.”

Preceding the Georgetown

series, Pitt’s Denny'Terzich took
a 14-8 loss to West Virginia.

The Panthers had done _very -

the _

well outside the conference,
taking advantage of lesser

‘competition, especially in

recent weeks. They‘ took two
series of two games hosting
Point Park. The first series
included a 10-8 win for Steve
Rau and an 8-5 win with Greg
Mrochko on the mound.
Mrochko and Vincent got the
wins for the Panthers in the
second series.

“You have too play
whoever you can play around
here,” Jackson said of the
non-conference schedule.
“You can’t play all Division-I
schools. We’ve beaten some
good Division-I schools. Some
of the non—league wins aren’t
against the strongest
competition, I'll admit that.

"When you want to play a I

lot of games, you have to play-
whoever you can," he said
"The only Division-I schools
in the area are_Youngstown
(State), Akron and WVU, and
we were scheduled to play
them all a total of eight times.
If you want to play other
games, you have to play Point
Park, IUP, Gannon, Slippery
Rock, all the small schools,
because. we’re not in. a
metropolitan area _like
Philadelphia where you have
the. Big Five 1 and all’ those“
other schools." in I l   I  V

Jackson also said the
weaker schedule was not
totally unintentional.

“The program hasn’t'been
real successful in recent years,
so you want to try to give the .
‘kids, some’ conﬁdence. ‘You

/ do that by playing ‘maybe not
the strongest teams, at least ~

not to start off. You can’t
pound your head against the
wall every game and play the
best, especially when you are

With the recent reformefforts by the
NCAA, 1992 is a crucial year for
intercollegiate athletic programs. At Pitt,
athletic director Oval Jaynes continues. to
strengthen commitment to academics whﬂe
strivingvto restore pride and tradition to
Panther athletics. _
Jaynes reflected on his first yearas
athletic director in a positive tone but
acknowledged that constant scrutiny by
the media hinders programs of Pitt’s statu re.
The Panther football program has been
the subject of local media criticism for

a merely serving as a stepping stone to the

1?,

National Football League for its student

athletes. The early departures of junior.

defensive ends Sean Gilbert and Keith
Hamilton sparked questions of priorities.

Jaynes said he believes Pitt is providing
‘its players with excellent ‘opportunities
both on and off the field. .

“There’s nothing wrong with someone
pursuing a professional [athletic] career,”
Jaynes said. “That’s an excellent opportunity

for young people who have those skills,

but at the same time I hope they realize
that their athletic careers can be taken
away from them on short notice. Their
education is something that can never be
taken away.” ~
Gilbert and Hamilton opted to enter the
draft only after consulting-Jaynes, Pitt’s
coaching staff and Pitt’s career-counseling
panel.
Jaynes said these discussions gave them
a larger perspective of exactly what they
were entering into. Jaynes said he
supported their decisions 100. percent
because he believes it was in the best
interests of both to turn pro. He said
having all of the facts and resources
available ahead of time makes these ‘career
decisions more likely to be successful.
Jaynes said critics should look at the
total picture before criticizing young people
for simply doing what is best for them.
With proper planning, a high draft choice
can take care of himself and his family for
the rest of their lives.
By being selected as the third pick of the
draft, Gilbert signed a contract that
guarantees him $7.5 million over the next

five years. As a fourth-round choice, _-‘

, -a

Hamilton will not enjoy this type of money
now but will inevitably receive the
opportunity to perform and earn it later if
successful on the ﬁeld.

“It’s almost mind—boggling the
opportunities that they have,”Jaynes said.
“These kids have a great opportunity to
make a tremendous amount of money.”

The media are often quick to point out
universities exploiting players but usually
fail. to see the other side —-‘— schools
providing rare opportunities for players.
Jaynes cited Pitt basketball center Darren
Morningstar, who may get an opportunity
to play in the National Basketball
Association simply because Pitt gave him
the ability to come back and play a ﬁfth
year while furthering his education at the
Katz School of Business.

_ “The system has also provided him with
an opportunity where he could » play
professionally,”Jaynes said. “It seems like
every time we turn around [the media sayl
we’ve done something. The media have
accented a number of negatives in our
program, There, are many stories like
Darren Morningstar’s that go untold.”

Jaynes said he feels negative media

 

- coverageis quickly becoming a national

problem. Jaynes admitted that “doing
something right doesn't sell papers” but
also said that the media are “eroding the
public’s faithin our program.”

He stressed that Pitt has taken measures
to continually increase graduation rates
for its ‘athletes and said he would like to
see the rates reach 70 to 75 percent. Pitt’s
men’s basketball players have graduated"
at a 67-percent clip since Paul Evans took
the_ reins as head coach.

“If they come in and don't get that
degree, they’re leaving empty—handed,”

A he said.

For those like Gilbert and Hamilton who
do leave early, there is always the
opportunity to finish a degree later. Jaynes
said he is concerned that students not only ‘

' take a degree with them when they leave

Pitt but also learn values that will carry
them through life. 8 

“Obviously itls important to get a degree,”
he said. “But the values can bejust as
beneficial. There -’s really no way to evaluate
the values that you take away.”

We’ve not made a commitment
to build anything yet,” he said.
A A decision was to be made by
May 1, but none has yet been
made. “There are ongoing
discussions in the university, and
information is still being gathered.
A decision won’t be made until
we know more about what
Featherstone is telling us,” James
Maher, chair ofPitt’s physics and
astronomy department, said.

To ensure Pitt did not make a
definitecommitment,
Featherstone came to Pittsburgh
for over a week to organize a
protest effort in the area. He
asked students from all local
colleges to become involved.

Early last week, the newly
formed group proteste_d in front
of. the Cathedral of Learning,
singing Native American songs
and passing out pamphlets.

They circulated a petition
calling the project a “slap in the
face of all native peoples,
especially the San Carlos Apache
people,” and said the university’s
involvementin the project “would
make Pitt a party to the University
ofArizona’s circumvention ofU.S.
environmental laws.”

Protesting students said Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
should not even be considering
the project; that the land is too
important and that they would
not give up their protest until
O’Connor backed off the project.

“I’ll go to O’Connor every day.
We won’t let up on this one. This

have $10,000 worth of voice.
Whatever it takes, I’ll do. All
people of all colors should have
respect for this land. It’s time
O’Connor started respecting the
earth,” Pitt stu‘dent Kristan Barber
said.

“Pitt has enough scandals, they
don't need to import a new one,”
Pitt Students for Peace President
Erin Bush said.

The protestors said that the Mt.
Graham project is not only an
environmental issue but a human
rights and religious issue as well.

“It’s our First_Amendment
[right]. [O’Connor] went and
ripped the Syria Mpsque down,
he’s sure as hell not going to rip
our mountain down, too,” Barber
said.

Pitt astronomers are quick to
counter the students’ anger with

.assurances that the university

does value the environment and
Pitt is only looking into the project.
If Pitt should decide to look at it
more intensely, the‘ envi-
ronmental aspects will be
researched in detail and will be
given consideration, according
to Maher.

Environmental aspects of the
project will be investigated before
any final decision is made, he
said. But the first step of the
whole process is to look at the
technical aspects; after they have
been looked into, then the other
factors will be investigated, Maher
said.

project from Pitt is very anxious
that whatever might be done is
sensitive to minority and
environmental groups, according
to Maher. 0

Though Featherstone said no
one at Pitt is listening to him,
Gatewood said that is not true.

“We’re sympathetic to
[Featherstone’s] concerns and
issues he raises. We have not
made a commitment to the
construction of an observatory
on Mt. Graham or any other site,”
Gatewood said.

“Our astronomers are looking
into a variety of telescope projects
they might join, and the University
of Arizona is one of them,” Maher
said. 0

Steve Emerine, member of the
University of Arizona’s Mt.
Graham steering committee and
associatedirector of public
information for the University of
Arizona, also confirmed that no
agreements had been made
between Pitt and Arizona.“Some

discussion is going on, and we
would certainly welcome Pitt as a
partner in the Columbus project,
but nothing is definite,” he said.

Emerine also said the
environmental aspects of the
project have been researched
thoroughly and many of
Featherstone’s statements are
untrue.

“lT he Mt. Graham project] has
been under study since 1980.
There was a four-year period of

‘very intensive studies,” he said.

Though Featherstone saidthe
red squirrel could face extinction
if the project was completed,
Emerine disagreed.

“The red squirrel would not be
put in danger by the project. In
fact, since construction has
started, the red squirrel population
has more than doubled,” Emerine
said.

He said the increase was not
because of anything project
members did, it was because of
good food and water supplies.

However this does prove
construction will not harm the
squirrels, Emerine said.

Emerine also pointed out that
the U.S. Game and Wildlife
Service granted the University of
Arizona permission for the
project. The U.S. Game and
Wildlife Service did make one
requirement of the University of
Arizona before it granted its
approval of the project: the
university had to spend $100,000
a year for 10 years to study the
red squirrel and how to protect
it. ‘

Emerine said this was no
problem to the university. In
fact, he said more has been done
than required.“The university is
in the third year of this, but has
already spent more than $500,000
on the studies,” Emerine said.

He said they have proven their ’
commitment to the environment
and after the project is complete
will continue to research and
protect the environment.

-While several Pitt‘ boats are
expected to compete for spots in
Saturday’s finals, the Pitt boat
expected to create the biggest
ripple in the field is the men’s
heavy—four boat. The lauded
lineup of Pete Alporn, Bob Falk,

has conquered its event
throughout the spring, most

recently in the last two weekends.
At both the Pitt—Duquesne
University-West Virginia

American Collegiate Rowing
Association regatta, the men’s

quartet crushed its competition _

for first—place finishes. These wins
were by 24 seconds in Pitts-
burgh and 20 seconds in
Columbus.

“They completely dominated
the field [the last two weeks],”
Kehm said. “They won by 40
seconds in the semis and 20
seconds in the finals. T hey’re just
head and shoulders above the
rest right now.”

Pitt took home‘ first-place team
trophies in both regattas and went
on to tie national power Marietta

The tie with Marietta was

particularly encouraging for’ A

Kehm considering the advantages
enjoyed by such a rowing
power. A ,

“They're an original Dad Vail
school,” Kehm said. “To tie
Marietta or any school whose
team is backed by an entire

community is something to be
proud of.

“Head-to—head, we had the
advantage [over Marietta],” Kehm
said. “But they had boats in more

0 events than we did, so it evened
out overall.”

Perhaps the .most pleasant
surprise of the past two regattas
has been the performance of the
men’s varsity pair. .

After losing to Carnegie
Mellon’s pair two weeks in a row,
Todd Ridenour and Bert Losken
stomped CMU’s tandem as well
as the rest of the field by a solid
20 seconds. Kehm said the pair’s .

‘performance was “the surprise of".
the regatta.

“They just have it all together.
I’m really glad they did it the
week before Dad Vail’s mostly
because they proved to both
themselves and their competitors
that they are a force to be dealt
with.”

Ridenour and Losken drew a
third—seed overall for this

'weekend’s championship, which

features 17 boats including rival
CMU, Marietta and Johns
Hopkins.

One Panther boat that could
potentially surprise the field,
Kehm indicated, is his unseeded
novice heavy—four boat of Shawn
Ellis, Curt Miller,John Whiteford,
Ron Schmoll and coxswain Jeff
Kamis. ,

And while this young Pitt boat
has been erratic at times this year,
Kehm said he thinks this could
be the time when potential is
finally realized.

“They’ve won before and have
proven they can beat the rest [of
the competition]. T hey’re just
lacking mental discipline right
now.

“They’re fighting each other in
the boat right now. When they
get their problems behind them, -
they’ll betough,” Kehm said.

Some People Just See A Rat.

We See

Hopefully, sooner or later there will be a
cure for cancer, a vaccine against AIDS
and an effective treatment for Alzheimer_'s.

And when these breakthroughs occur it
will be thanks to the rats and other
laboratory animals that are so vital to
medical research.

Because, historically, no cure, no vac-
cine, no revolution in surgery was ever
discovered without animal research.

Today, however, there is a movement
afoot that would ban the use of
laboratory animals in the war against
disease.

This so-called “animal rights” movement’

believes that animals and humans are
equal, and that “even if animal research
resulted in a cure for AIDS, they would
be against it.” In their war against
biomedical research, the animal rights
activists use disinfonnation, pressure
tactics and active terrorism.

The notion that a rat and a child are

A Cure For Cancer.

equal is an obscenity to most Americans.’
The belief that research which can save
the lives of millions of humans (and yes,
even animals) should be paralyzed, is
an outrage against all living creatures.

Americans for Medical Progress salutes
the dedicated men and women working
to conquer the illnesses that plague
mankind.

Americans for Medical Progress exists
to provide grassroots support for the

scientists who are the front line in the
war against disease.

More importantly, we've formed the
Americans for Medical Progress
' Educational Foundation to spearhead

the critical effort to educate American
opinion leaders and citizens about the
need for animal research. Because society
cannot allow itself to be manipulated by a
handful of zealots who would equate the
life of a rat with that of a child.
