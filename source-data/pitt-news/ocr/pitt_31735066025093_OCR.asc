Spontaneity, Variety
creates entertaining
night at the improvs

By Jason Hillman
Editor in chief

Two people are picked at
random to start. The audi-
ence around the stage gives
a situation and two charac-
ters, like Chef Boyardee and
Nell Carter caught in a grain
elevator. «Then the fun
begins. I

The game is called
“Freeze,” and the place is
the improv. It is called
“Freeze” because at any time
a member of the audience
can yell “Freeze,” replace
one of the participants and
take the situation in another
direction.

“It’s good training for
quick thinking and being
able to work with someone
on stage,” this year’s host
Chris Potocki said.

A night at the improvs,
according to Potocki,
includes an opening game of
“Freeze,” then three or four
more games.

Anyone in the audience
can participate in any of the
games.

“The thing about improvs
is it’s audience participa-

tion,” Potocki said. “That’s
what we like about it. It’s
the fact an audience member
is in complete control, it’s
not the host. It’s them.

“It’s not like you have to .

go through a training
process. You just go and
enjoy yourself.

"We don’t want it to be
this pressure where you feel
like you are going to be
called on. It isn’t like that.

"We wouldn’t pick a
stranger and say, ‘You, get
up there and tap dance for
10 minutes.”

Some of the other games
that are played during a nor-
mal improv are: Genre Jump
— two people are put in a
situation for which the host
will yell out different acting
genres, like ‘S05 horror
movie, Shakespeare, musical,
Japanese B—movie, etc.;
Radio Days — this is done
with just voices, like a radio
program," Advanced Freeze—
six people, each with. an
occupation, have to interact;
and Grecian Urn — a purely
physical activity in which six
people have 10 seconds to

Transplant, AIDS drug draw world focus to UPMC

By Pete Kapustynski
News Assistant

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center was the "focus
of the world’s attention this
summer when Surgeons under
the Supervision of transplant
pioneer Thomas Starzl per-
formed the first ever baboon-
to—human liver transplant.

Previous cross-Species trans-
plants, or xenotransplants, had
not been successful before
because of tissue rejection, but
recent advances, especiall-y in
drug therapy, have made doc-

tors optimistic in this case.

A baboon liver was cho-
sen because baboon tissue is
resistant to hepatitis B,
with which the patient is infect-
ed.

Hepatitis B destroys liver tis-
sue, and a new liver, composed
of human tissue, would soon
have been infected also.

People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals criticized

the surgery and held a small
protest outside Presbyterian
University Hospital.

In the second week of July
the 35-year-old baboon-
liver recipient was upgraded
from critical to serious condi-
tion. ‘

The patient was clinically sta-
ble and showed no Sign of tis-
sue rejection. His level of
bilirubin, a component of bile,
was normal for the first time
since he contracted hepatitis B.

The patient was upgraded to
fair condition in late July.
Doctors reported the implanted
liver had grown to the size of a
normal human liver.

The patient’s liver function
was improving, and his biliru—
bin level had returned to nor-
mal. A

In early August UPMC report-
ed the xenotransplant patient
was Still in fair condition and
had been moved from the
Intensive Care Unit to a private
room." Doctors said his liver

function and bilirubin level
were normal. J

Being in a regular room has
given the patient more mobility
and independence, which doc-
tors Say are important factors in
making a good recovery,
according to UPMC spokesper-
son Lisa Rossi.

This was not the only signifi-
cant event occurring at the
UPMC this summer.

Other events include:

-Pitt researchers began evalua-
tion of a new drug, Stavudine,
for the treatment of HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.

Staff from the Pitt Treatment

, Evaluation Center was among

researchers from around the
country participating in the
clinical evaluation of Stavudine,
or D/iT.

dine (AZT) or dideoxyinosine
(DDI) had.

Phase one testing involving
close ranging and toxicity of
Stavudine had already been
completed.

In the second phase of test-
ing a randomized clinical trial
began to measure the relative
effectiveness of Stavudine
when compared to the current
standard treatment, AZT.
oln June, four—year-old Laura

Davies, who arrived at
Children’s Hospital in
Pittsburgh from England,

underwent a liver and small-
intestine transplant.

While a liver and small-intes-
tine transplant had never been
performed in England, Davies
was the 11th patient to receive
this operation at Children’s.

When Davies was born, her
small intestine was outside of
her body.

_ Although this was corrected
by surgery, she had been born

,with short-gut syndrome as
‘well.

Her small intestine was short-
er than it should be and lacked

sufficient surface area to absorb -

enough nutrients from food.
Doctors knew her small intes-
tine would have to be replaced.
-Presbyterian and Montefiore
University hospitals merged
their emergency room services
and began using an expanded
ER located at Presby.

The capacity of the Presby

The consolidation eliminated

needed to be renovated, and it

made more sense to rebuild '

one and expand it to accom-
modate patients from both hos-
pitals, according to hospital
officials.

-On July 22, Kenneth Varner
was recovering from heart-
transplant surgery done at the
UPMC. ,

At that time, 57-year-old
Varner had also set a record
for living the longest time in an
out—of—h.ospital setting with
an artificial heart
according to a UPMC press
release.

Varner-had lived for an
unprecedented 131 days at
Family House with an implant-
ed Novacor left-ventricle assist
system.

Students earn money selling body ﬂuids

By Jose Jones
For The Pitt News

Vlf you want an adventure
rather than just a job and really
need to earn some cash fast, all
you have to do is look around
abit to find the solution to
your unemployment problems.

‘College students are in a

. prime position to take advan-

tage of the many alternative
Odd jobs available.

 You don’t have to be dead to
donate your body to science.
Smart students can use their
bodies to earn capital before
they’re corpses. B

One job" that's more blood
than sweat — and occasionally
some tears — is plasma dona-

tion. Pittsburgh Blood Plasma is I

a local firm where anyone can
go to earn some extra money
for just laying around. I
Dedicated donors can really
cash in on their corpuscles.
There is a bonus payment for
your first session, and after the

second visit the salary is $15 a
bag. Some students make as
much as $100 a month selling
their blood.

Becoming a participant in a
pharmaceutical study is a less
draining form of employment.

Biodecision Laboratories
often hires college students for
its research. A typical study
may last a few days. You live at
the lab. There are study rooms
and even a computer for stu-
dents to patronize while being

scrutinized. The lab tries to A
schedule its experiments on

weekends‘, when most students
are able to drop out of society.
This job requires that poten-
tial participants, usually. males,
be completely drug free.
Pitt conducts many studies

‘throughout the year and can
provide the occasional short--I

term job for any number of stu-
dents who fit qualifications
such as these: non-smoking,
left-handed, red-headed, or
male sufferers Of, athlete's foot

between the ages Of 18 to 21.

There are usually ﬂiers up_all
over campus for various
research projects being con-
ducted by the university. There
is no way to predict when
these studies occur, what types
Of subjects will be needed or
how much the pay is.

If you ‘don’t want to sell your
body to science, you can
always just sell your body.
-Beverly Simic, owner of

.’Blondie and CO., a placement

agency for exotic dancers, has
employed several college stu-
dents in the past.

‘‘I hada foreign-exchange
student from Czechoslovakia
who worked for one month,”
she said. ‘‘I have a male_ dancer
who is a med student.”

According to Beverly it is a
“safe" job and pays up to
$2,000 a week. “Basically peo-
ple do this because of the
money,” she said.

If giggling your giblets gives

you goose bumps, there are

less risque ways of selling
yourself.

Todd Whiting, owner Of
Horsefeathers BC Singing
Telegrams Etc»., said his mes-
sengers “generally have to have
some kind of entertainment tal-
ent, but not necessarily experi-
ence.” Singing messengers must
be Over 18 years old and have
their Own transportation.

“It’s a nice job for students
who want to have some fun,”
he said.

But maybe you’d rather be l

seen but not heard.

Pittsburgh is rapidly becom-
ing one of the hottest spots for
Hollywood. More studios are
discovering this area’s ability to
provide a unique, affordable
alternative to other played—Out
markets.

This means jobs. Even if your
resume can boast nothing more
challenging than “Tree,” there’s
work for you as an extra.

Ridesbarmg is comfortable solution to commuting /aozssles

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

You’ve circled around the streets of
Oakland for half an hour looking for a
place to park. There isn’t an available
meter to be found, and you’re already
10 minutes late for class and feeling
very frustrated. If you’re thinking there
just isn’t parking anywhere at Pitt,
you’re not alone. Commuting to
Oakland has become more of.a chal-
lenge than the classes themselves.

Most students think that if they don’t
have a car, they have to take a bus. If
they have a car, there’s that problem of
finding a parking space. It seems like a
no-win situation, but there might be
another choice.

The Ridesharing Office of the
University of Pittsburgh offers car pools
and van pools that may be able to get
you to and from campus without quite
as much hassle. Kathleen Miller, pro-
gram manager for Pitt’s ridesharing pro-
gram, said the solution to Pitt’s traffic
congestion doesn’t lie in constructing
another parking lot.

“The philosophy on ‘campus is not to
build more garages. The philosophy is
to reduce demand for the parking that’s

, here by making better use of it and by

offering students, faculty and staff other
choices. That’s why we arrange car
pools and van pools and provide transit
information from this department for

— . anyone who wants it,” Miller said.

One part of the program involves
vans that run on a regular schedule

‘between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., from subur-

ban areas not as easily accessible by the

bus routes. Although these vans are
geared more toward Oakland employ-
ees, students may find them helpful too.

“Students that we have here in the
business school, the medical school, the
nursing school, who have to be here
during what I call work hours, this is a
good commuting choice for them
because essentially for them, going to
school might as well be going to work.
This is a good choice for students» who
commute with steady schedules.”

For students whose daily routines are
irregular, the program has a separate
car—pooling program available.

“We do a rideshare car—pool matching
just‘ for students that we do at the
beginning of the fall term and at the
beginning of January. We_ try to match
students with students to see who else
contacts us and see where they’re com-
ing from. We might get one student,
three students or 10 students who are
somewhere in your area,” Miller said.

“We do not play with hours for stu-
dents because there’s a lot of variability.
We leave that up to the students to
work it out. We tried doing that the
very first year we did student matching,
but it was very difficult because of the
schedules. We found that it is better to
let students work it out for themselves.
You decide what your flexibility will
be.” _

If you happen to "have a class up on
the Hill or to head up to Trees Hall,
there's the OC lot on Allequippa Street

with limited parking available to stu-

dents.
Another lot, Panther Hollow, is locat-
ed at the bottom of the hill behind the

Graduate School of Business. A third
lot, for students only, is located on
South Bouquet Street. These lots are
accessible for $3 with a student ID.

Miller said she repeatedly encourages
students who are hoping to find parking
to commute in early. With as many as
15,000 people commuting into Oakland
a day, that’s the only way you can plan
on finding that empty spot, she said.

“The lots fill up easy,” Miller warned.
“I tell people all the time, if you plan to
come to a transient lot, you have to be
here before 8 a.m. You must‘be here
early. If you want to come sliding in
here at 9 or 10 a.m., you are not going
to find parking. If you don’t have class-
es that early, go to the library, go to
breakfast, read a book in your car 
Parking’s very tight.”

Ofcourse there are city parking
meters, but students may find them
more trouble than they’re worth. “We
have about 2,000 parking meters in
Oakland. We have no eight-hour
meters, only one, two and four. If a stu-
dent’s going to park at a meter, they
must be willing to come out during the
day and put money into the meter. That
makes it very hard if you’re in class,”
Miller said. /

‘Likewise, the city lot across from
I-Iillman Library can stretch a student
budget beyond its limits, as will other
pay lots on campus that charge hourly
rates, she said.

“Three dollars a day is a bargain in
Oakland,”_Miller_ said. “lThe city lot] is
expensive. Theoretically it’s not for all-
day parking. It's to come in here for an
hour, pick up a book in Hillman and

go. If you come here for class and come

back at the end of the day, you’re look-

ing at somewhere between $5 to $7 to
park here for a day. I think that’s a lot
of money."

Oakland is host to more than the
University of Pittsburgh, as Miller
reminds prospective commuters:

“We have the medical center; that’s
20,000 more people. In addition to that
we have all the doctors that practice at
one of the hospitals but have a private
practice in Oakland. Somebody’s got to
park their cars to come see that doctor.
We have many visitors to the campus
every day.”

During the evening the parking prob-
lems become a bit more manageable.
Commuters registered for evening class-
es may be interested in buying a univer-
sity parking pass for 825.

But as for which is better, commuting
for day or night classes, Miller said
either way has its good and bad points.
“During the day there will be more peo-
ple that you could come and go with.
Also you will have more options. The
transit service, the Port Authority, is bet-
ter during the day. Your choices for
direct—service commuting become very
limited in the evening. Now contrary to
that, in the evening we do have parking
available that we don’t have during the
day  Compared to three bucks a day,
$25 for an evening parking permit that
is good all semester is great.”

If students are interested in the
ridesharing program, Miller encourages
them to call or stop by the office for
information. The number is 624-0687,
the office is at 207\Oakland Avenue.

After a rocky start,Pz'tt Chancellor].

 

Dennis O'Connor readiesto make change

Byjulie Sabol O’Connor: That’s an interesting question. There’s been some, certainly some pressing
News Eduor and difficult personnel decisions. It is always difficult in times of resource limitations to

make decisions affecting the distribution of those resources. The difficulties associated
with those decisions have been somewhat eased by the fact that they were collective
decisions. There was an enormous amount of faculty, staff and students involved in mak-
ing those decisions. So despite" the fact they were difficult, everybody shared in them.

After a year at the helm of the university, Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor said he is
ready to steer Pitt on a new course. ~ I 1

O’Connor came to the university last August in the midst of controversy over former‘
Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s multi-million dollar retirement package. .

‘Some critics’ thought O’Connor was picking up where Posvar left off after details of an

$82,000 office renovation and a‘$92,SO0 installation ceremony were disclosed. After that
controversy died down, O’Connor dealt with many issues facing the university and made
several significant decisions in his first year.Against the recommendations of the
University Senate Council and the Student Government Board, O’Connor did not expel
the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps for violating the university's nondiscrimination poli-
CY- ~ . '
 O’Connor also faced problems regarding minority student retention. “We felt he didn’t
deal with [the minority retention issuelas effectively as he could have  We have to
move beyond the rhetoric; it’s one thing to express a need or concern, it’s another to put
together a strategic plan to deal it. "We’re waiting to see his strategic plan,” Black Action
Society Chair Marcus Guy said. ' I f

‘But on the other side many lauded O’Connor for opening the
lines of communication at the university} . .

“I think a new attitude isbuilding  people in the univer-
sity were feeling [they were in] kind of a rut towards the
end of [Posvar’s] presidency; they felt their ideas weren’t
being listened to, but now things have changed. People’s
ideas are being heard and acted upon,-”i Student
Government Board President“Gil Golden said.

Though not all of O’Connor’s, actions were received
well,  said he is comfortable with his decisions. Now
that his “cast of .‘characters”_is in place, O’Connor hopes
he will be able to effect real change at the university.

PN: What do you see as the strongest area of the university, why?

ably good health in terms of its resources available and its structure. it’s in enormously
good health intellectually, which is, I think, one of the cardinal strengths that one looks
for in an institution such as the University of Pittsburgh. The faculty and the students are
among the brightest and the best — and that’s what you want in an institution.

PN: What do you see as the weakest aspect, why?

the institution needs to be better organized and more responsive to the community —
the institutional community and university community.

O’Connor: Well I think it’s been somewhat of a different year.
What we didn’t have was permanent people occupying
some very key positions,  I think this year would repre-
sent more of a hands—on type of management than I
would see this upcoming year to be. Because the per-
manent people are now in place,  I can pull back a
little bit now.

Adjustment made easy

By Lisa Toboz
For The Pitt News

Although the transition from high school classes to more
rigorous college courses can be difficult, first-year students
can make the adjustment easier by taking advantage of the
services offered at the Learning Skills Center.

Time management is important for success in college,
according to counselor Rosalind Jones. The workshops
emphasize devising a plan of action to balance time and
coursework efficiently. .

The largest problem first—year students encounter is the
adjustment between high school and college, according to
Jones.

Jones said college-level work requires much more read-
ing, writing and self-management than high-school work.

Students should not allow themselves to become over-
loaded with activities and/or hectic class schedules.

Jones recommends that students prepare a “daily activity
calendar,” which helps ease the pressures of college life.

“Managing time is a good way for [first-year students] to
get a jump start on the term and get better prepared and

, better organized for college studies,” Jones said.

In the time-management portion of the workshops, stu-
dents Iearn that the way to achieve a balance of time and
work is to organize, “which is one of the keys to success,
especially for [first-year studentsl,” Jones said.

The Learning Skills Center is not restricted to first-year stu-
dents and offers _a variety of free workshops. Free speed-
reading workshops and tutoring in math courses up to first-
year calculus are offered at the center.

Beginning the week of Sept. 14, workshops will cover
these topics: reading texts on a college level, developing
strong note taking, improving memory, preparing tests, tak-
ing tests and managing time.

"All college students can learn. new strategies and tech- . '

niques for studying by using the services here," Jones said.
_ The Learning Skills Center is located in 311 William Pitt-
Union. For a complete listing of workshops and times call

Quiet study nooks blanket campus

The comfortable chairs are all taken. Even the
study carrels are filled. With Hillman Library
packed to the roof and an exam at 9 a.m., where
can students turn?

Although the first floor of Hillman had at one
time been listed as one of the nation's best pick-
up places, even the biggest flirts need a quiet
study area sometimes.

The first floor of the Cathedral of Learning is
one of the most popular spots for students to
sink into their calc books. While the light isn't
the greatest, many students say there are many
advantages to studying there.

Food is permitted, and the building is open 24
hours a day, with a security guard at the
entrance at night. (Students who enter after mid-
night must use the Fifth Avenue side door.)

Other than the obvious choices (Hillman and
the Cathedral), there are many other study areas
tucked away on the Pitt campus.

The lounges in the William Pitt Union offer a
comfortable, quiet atmosphere that is good for
naps as well as studying. The upstairs lounges

’ can not be used after hours, but they are usually

quiet throughout the day.For both finals and
midterms the lower part of the union is open for
all-night study, at which the Student Government
Board usually provides refreshments. '

Many of the buildings on campus have small
libraries of their own that are often quieter than
Hillman or the Cathedral.

Buildings in which students can stake out a
quiet spot for a couple of hours include Alumni
I-lall, Benedum Hall, Old Engineering Hall,
Forbes Quadrangle, Frick Fine Arts Building,
Langley Hall, the law school, Library and
Information Science Building, Mervis Hall, Music
Building, Public Health building, Scaife Hall, the
Stephen Foster Memorial, Thackeray Hall and
Victoria Building.

  

    
 

   
 

Parking option available to students

Catherine Goldstein
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Commuting into Oakland,
whether it’s for class, work, a
doctor’s visit or just a fun—filled
day of lunch and shopping, is
usually a traumatic experience
due to the unbelievable lack of
parking.

Granted, there are university-
owned lots above ground for
which one needs a permit;

however they are restricted to-_

Pitt faculty and staff members.
Students can get permits as
Jvvell, but they can only park

after 5 p.m.
If a student has a class before

that designated time and is a
commuter, that’s when the
nightmare begins.

One could park in the South
Oakland area, but because it is
mostly residential permits are
required. One then runs the
risk of getting a parking ticket.

This fall students will have
another option to end their
parking woes as well as the
opportunity to buyand sell
their trinkets and crafts.

In the area atthe end of
Joncaire Street known as

-Panther Hollow, there is a"

parking lot containing 56
spaces.  V V ;
Because it is. afar walk from

campus, there is a shuttle run-
ning to and from the lot.

On Saturdays and Sundays
there will be a ﬂea market from
which a portion of the money

earned, will go to hospitalized

and other needy veterans.

Almost immediately after Sol
Gross bought the 28 acres in
Panther Hollow three years
ago, the city of Pittsburgh put
up barriers at the entrances of
the property and revoked his
building permits.

After two years of battling in
the court of common pleas
Cross was awarded the permits

Experience Asia, Africa, Europe in CL nationality rooms

By Carmen M. McGill -
Staff Writer

Although Room 319 in the
Cathedral of Learning may just
be the place where you learned
the existential, view of
Nietzsche, it is also an authen-
tic display of Armenian culture
that 30,000 people come to see
every year.

That room, along with 22
others, are part of Pitt's

. Nationality Rooms.

Originally designed to be an
inspiration that higher educa-
tion was within their grasp to
immigrants who ‘had left their
homelands, the Nationality
Rooms helped put Pitt on the

- map, according to Director of
the Nationality Rooms and
-Intercultural Exchange
Programs~Maxine Bruhns.

Each classroom’s construction
is directed by an architect who
is responsible for seeing that
the classroom is an authentic
representation of the culture of
a given heritage, Bruhns said.

  

  

In 1926, committees com-
posed of members of fraternal
unions, churches and other
organizations were set up to
ensure that theiclassrooms
accurately depicted the various
cultural backgrounds of the stu-
dents that would attend the
university.

“Thirty years later, there were
19 classrooms,” Bruhns said.

Artists are brought in to
reproduce the artwork of a
given culture during a specific
era. “Only. one [of the class-
rooms] took a little less than 10
years to construct,” Bruhns
said. '

Each room costs about a

quarter of a million dollars,

according to Bruhns.“To be eli-
gible for consideration of a
nationality room, a given
nationality must be able to pro-
vide a standing community that
keeps representing their com-

munity here [in Pittsburghl,”

Bruhns said.T here are plans for
the addition of a Japanese
room, an East Indian room and

“Private committees make the

Bruhns, there aren’t verymany
problems with defacement of
the classrooms.

“They are so beautiful that
people understand th-at they
are special,” she said. “They
must be a functioning class-
room. They have excellent
quality, the students see that;
they observe that and respect
it.”

One of the newest rooms,
the African Heritage room is
largely based on the architec-
ture ofIGhana, Bruhns said.
The walls of the room display
symbols of math, science, liter-
ature, music and art. The room

tion of the lot.

Dan Shento, an employee of Gross‘, described the area as a
“garbage dump” before Gross started work on it. There were bot-
tles, old tires, sewage and other forms of garbage covering the
land, he said. It was a place for “kids to just party,” Shento said.

The road leading to the lot was closed for at least 15 years since
Allegheny Asphalt moved out of that same site.

Residents living by the lot on Boundary Street said they are not
anxious to see that road open again because they don’t want the
traffic it will cause. I I ' ,

There is only one lane on the street, and traffic will be coming
from Hazelwood and Second Avenue.

Gross proposed at an Oakland Business and Civic Association
meeting on August 19 to construct an alternate road parallel
to the railroad to alleviate the unwanted traffic on Boundary

More tbom just oz social club, BiGALA strives for awareness

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

Attempting to educate, sup-
port, and provide political
action to the university commu-

nity, Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay and

Lesbian Alliance is much more
than just a social group,
according to co—president Linda
Jarrett.

“lTherel are really four dis-

tinct functions that we do have

at the university...there are a lot
of different functions that
BiGALA could serve, it’s really
whatever you want to do,”
Jarrett said.

Educating the community -

about gay and lesbian issues is
a priority of the group, accord-
ing to Jarrett.

“We go and wespeak in vari-
ous classrooms. We do presen-
tations for, the Office of
Residence Life on what the
experience is like being gay on
campus or being lesbian on
campus,” she said.

A Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Studies Symposium will be held

, in the first week of October.

There will be presentations by
Pitt faculty and students on
issues and research they’ve
done on lesbian, gay, and
bisexual issues.

“We’re also going to have
one night where undergraduate
students present papers too,”
Jarrett said. ”.Pitt doesn’t have
any classes for students exclu-
sively on gay and lesbian
issues...a lot of students...want
to be able to learn about issues
concerning gay/lesbian/bisexu-

al peoples.”
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O'Connor has publicly

endorsed the symposium pro-

gram and is going to sign the
certificates that will be present-
ed‘to each of the speakers,

J according to Jarrett.

“We’ll have a room full of
people to tell their coming out
stories. We did that last year, it
was successful,” Jarrett said.

“We also have a support

function. Like our rap groups,

if people need to talk to some-
one...if their having prob-

tlems...[such as] their parents

found out that they were
gay..'.we would provide sup-
port for that person," Jarrett

" said.

The group is very active off

campus as well as on, contact— ‘

ing local candidates and march-

ing in gay pride parades.

“We may do something like
volunteer at [Pennsylvania
Senate candidate] Lynn Yeakel’s
campaign headquarters," Jarrett

_ said.

"The group is interested in
politics on the national, state
and local levels because of
issues that occur there that may
affect our own gay, bisexual
and lesbian community,” she
said.

“The other function of
‘course, is social...Anybody
could come and participate in
more than one function, or if
they just want to meet some-
body thenleave, or if they
want to meet some more
friends, and that’s all they want,
they can get that from
BiGALA,” Jarrett said.

BiGALA’s weekly schedule
for the Fall includes:

-Monday night BiGALA has a
men’s and a women’s rap
group. They’re in seperate

rooms so the participantsare

more comfortable, according to
Jarrett.

I “They’re two seperate rooms
because we found that, as far
as people that are dealing with
coming out issues, we’ve been
able draw more women in if
it’s just women and more men
in if it’s just men," Jarrett said.

_speaker each month,

“Its a small group where a lot

of the people talk about per-
sonal issues and also get
acquainted with BiGALA, to see
what’s going on...it’s really for
support more so than social. Of
course it usually turns into
social, but it’s more support
oriented,” she said.
-Tuesday night is for group
discussions. “We’ll have a dif-
ferent ‘topic every week...one
week we may talk about inter-
racial relationships, another
week we may talk about the
sexual revolution and .it’s
impact on gay men...it’s really
up to each person...different
group members will lead the
discussion every week. We’ll
also try to bring in a guest
like
somebody from Transpitt,
which is the transgender group
in Pittsburgh...certainly that’s an
area of our community that we
need to reach.,” Jarrett said.

Previous dicussion night
speakers have included repre-
sentatives from Parents and

   

Friends of Lesbians and Gays,
Lesbians are Parents, Gay and
Lesbian Community Center,
and the1993 March on
Washington committee.

“We’ll probably bring in
PFLAG again,” Jarrett said
“Given the ages of our group
it’s a hot topic,” BiGALA co-
president Todd Kinavey said.
-Wednesday nights will be for
the People of Color rap group.
This group is for discussion of
issues that are important to
people of color, but different
from gay or lesbian issues,
according to Kinavey.
oThursday nights have been
left open on the schedule for
socials or any other unforseen
events.

-Friday nights the businesss
meetings are held.

Upcoming BiGALA events
include:
‘-Art Theme Week, will be the
first week of November.
BiGALA is looking for a broad
range of artists to participate,
for example those involved

with sculpting, poetry, theatre
and performance art, according
to BiGALA member Robin
Poland.

‘‘I’m looking for local gay
artists to come and give a lec-
ture and present what their
working on...I’m looking for a
combination of different type
of artists, not one category...it
doesn’t necessarily have to
even be gay art, but art in gen-
eral...l want them to talk about
the Pittsburgh lbisexual, gay
and lesbian} community specifi-
cally and what they’re doing
for the community,” Poland
said. J
oThe first week of December is
Spirituality Week. BiGALA
members have contacted 8 tell-
gious organizations in the city
to send representatives to
address the issue of being gay,
lesbian, bisexual within their
faith, according to Jarrett.

“We want to include non—tra—
ditional religions, for example
wiccans or pagans,”Kinavey
said.

Entertainment is easy to come by ifryou
know where to look, and the best place to
start is “dahntahn” (Pittsburghese for
“downtown” for those of you from “aht a
tahn”). _

l-low about a taste of Americana? Yes,
Pittsburghers are fortunate enough to have
a red-hot baseball team which frequently
lights up Three Rivers Stadium. For just a
few dollars you can come watch Barry
Bonds and the rest of the Pirates crush
their opponents against a backdrop of the
celestial glow of some of the best fire-

Smithfield and East Carson streets.

It was voted the No. 1 sports bar in
Pittsburgh, and it’s a great spot to pound
“Cold Am” (that’s cold Iron City Beer for
those who still aren’t familiar with
Pittsburghese) and watch your favorite
teams battle it out on the big screen.

If you’re not quite a sports fanatic and
you’re just looking for a wild time, try the
North Hills’ best night spot, Kangaroo’s

Pennsylvania’s first Australian—theme pub

home of “industrial dancing.” .

The Metropol is the ‘Burgh’s most
famous post—modern dance club; it spins
anything from house music to progressive
to techno-industrial, depending on which

have been known to show up there when
they’re in tahn, Wayne Gretsky being one
of them. '

Power. Although U.S.
citizens have the awe-
some power to decide
who the next leader of
their country will be, in
the last election only 37
percent of eligible voters
stepped into a polling
place to pull the red
lever.

With only two months
remaining, before the
presidential election, the
identity of the next leader
of our country will be a
mystery until Nov. 3.

Anyone over 18 years
of age can pick up an
application and register.
Application forms are
available in local banks,
public libraries, certain
post offices, the munici-
pal building, Giant Eagle
supermarkets and the
county office building.

Even if you are already
registered, you may have
to register again if you
have not voted in the
past two years or if your
address has changed, said
Vernie Sanko of the voter
registration office.

According to Sanko,
you have to be registered.
in the county you wish to
vote in. If you are regis-
tered in another county,
you can mail in an absen-
tee ballot to your home
county’s voter registration
office.

“An absentee ballot
allows you to actually
vote through the mail. If
you’re already registered
in another county and
don’t want to register
again at a temporary
address, then an absentee

g ballot is best,” Sanko said.

You must register 50
days before the election.
After which, you will then
be sent a voter identifica-
tion card and the location
where you go to vote.

Construction Worker juggles tools, time, textbooks

By David W. Matta
Staff Writer

The American dream dictates
that you go to college to pur-
sue a degree in something that
interests you, to get a job in
your chosen field, to have a
successful career and then to
live happily ever after. If some-

one already had a secure job in
their chosen ﬁeld and getting a
degree wouldn't advance his or
her career, there would be no
reason to go to school, right?
Robert W. I-Iartung Jr., doesn’t
feel that way. ‘

Bobby Hartung is a private
contractor who works with his
father at Father and Son

Bobby Hartung drills nails into the house he is building.

Construction in the greater
Pittsburgh area. He works from
8 a.m. to S p.m., six days a
week, and he attends classes
full time in the College of
General Studies at the
University of Pittsburgh. His
work in college has no bearing
on his job. He does it simply
because he wants to.

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News

“I'm furthering my education

because I believe education

genuinely enhances a person,
any person. I’m going to school
for myself,” Hartung said. “I go
to school because it will make
me a better person, not
because it will get me a better
job.

“School is essentially my
hobby. It’s a fun and rewarding
diversion for me. When I work,
I have very little interaction
with people and no involve-
ment with my peers. Most of
the other tradesmen that I work
with are middle-aged men with
families. So the university life
enables me to experience a lot
of new people. 1 otherwise
would have no other opportu-
nity to socialize with people
whose pants don’t droop.”

Hartung said he is a blue—col-
lar person from a blue—collar
family, and he doesn’t view
attending a university as a way
of changing that. He is proud
of his career and himself. He
‘said that carpentry is not what
he does, but who he is.

He is 22, and he has been
working full time as a carpenter
for five years and has been
involved in the industry his
entire life. He didn’t enter col-
lege immediately after high
school because he didn’t con-

sider himself a good enough.

student at the time;
“I am not a great student, but
that’s OK because I am a great

carpenter,” Hartung said. He
decided to go to college after
taking two years off from
school because he realized that
he didn’t have to get an educa-
tion to change himself; rather,
he wanted to improve himself.
“I don’t have to go to school to
change myself into something
that I’m not or'even care to
be.”

He started at the Community
College of Allegheny County.
After going there for two years
with a grade—point average of

3.24, he transferred to Pitt. He

now intends to major in liberal

studies. He makes a good liv-.

ing, and he will continue to do
so, but he is more interested in
personal happiness than in his
financial position.

“I enjoy going to school and
getting an education. In fact, I
think that I enjoy it more
because I’m furthering my edu-
cation as opposed to creating a
transcript to submit to future
employers. I am my future
employer.”

Manystudents have trouble
motivating themselves to go to
class or do school work, even
without the burden of a full-
time job.

Hartung doesn’t have that
problem. He could stop going
to school at any time and
spend more time working,
socializing or just sleeping.
School is part of his social life,

Starting college is an exciting aswell as
an anxious“ time for most students. The

‘S changes and challenges that occur over a

very brief period of time are intense and
diverse.

The ﬂurry of mandatory activities can,
in themselves, be a little dizzying: orien-
tation programs, testing, registration, IDs,
room assignments, financial—aid forms,
etc.

In addition, the problems of establish-
ing new friendships, learning to interact
with people from different backgrounds
and making choices from a smorgasbord
of academic possibilities and social activi-
ties provide other sources of stress.

Add to this the new freedom from
parental supervision, exposure to new
value systems and the change in status
from well—established and well—known
high—school senior, to unknown and

_ untested first—year college student, and it
a is easy to understand why so many new

students develop a growing sense of anx-
iety and self-doubt during the first few

weeks of their first year in college.

. Most students will quickly learn to
cope with all of this and settle into their
lives _as Pitt students.A good many, how-
ever, feel overwhelmed, lose faith in

‘ ~ themselves and have difficulty making a

good adjustment to college life. _
If you find yourself struggling in the
weeks ahead and begin to doubt your

ability to survive, don’t give up hope.

There is plenty of time to recover and
many resources available to help you.
You might save yourself from some of

. this grief, however, if you focus now on

well.

Probably the most important thing you
can do right now is to make a self—assess-
ment. What kinds of things have gotten
you into trouble in the past? Do you tend
to avoid facing problems as they emerge?

Do you spend a lot of time putting your— ,

self down when things go wrong, instead
of taking some action to change things?

    

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

Are you a serious procrastinator? If you
can identify these or other traits that have
created problems for you, own up to
them, and commit yourself to change.
Find a way to believe that you are capa-
ble of behaving differently.

The self—assessment can take many
forms and should focus on strengths that
need to be utilized as well as weaknesses
that need to be overcome.

The important thing is to make
changes and to develop a success plan
for yourself from the very beginning. -

 Exciting, anxious time awaits students

Steven Covey wrote that “all things are
created twice,” and by this he means that
before we create anything in reality, we
need to create it first in our minds.To
build a successful college career you
need first to envision it.

I cannot encourage you strongly
enough to take the time to think about
what you want to accomplish in your
first year at Pitt and then to write out a
rough plan describing how to accomplish
these goals.You may not obtain all that
you plan, but you will improve your
odds of success if you have a plan.

In addition to making a plan, decide
now to make use of the free services
available to you.

The university uses your tuition dollars
and other resources not only to provide a
first—rate faculty, but also to hire advisers,
resident assistants, career and placement
counselors, learning—skills specialists, psy-
chologists and other professionals to help
you succeed. Use these people. Assert
yourself and make the university work
for you. ‘

Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “What lies
behind us, or what lies before us, are
tiny matters compared to what lies within
us.”

I encourage you to attend now to what
lies within you and to draw from your
unique talents to make your first year at
Pitt a successful one.

Students able
to trade books

with new plan

By Kellie Burkett
Staff Writer

Many students have experi-
enced the frustration of walking
into the Pitt Book Center with a
handful of books and leaving
with a small fist full of money.

The non-profit Book Center
made a profit of $527,000 and
had a $1 million reserve fund in

1991, according to the Night

Times. The Book Center declined
to comment on these figures.

“With the increase in tuition 
Pitt students need a way to see
eye to eye when buying and sell-
ing textbooks,” said Marcie
Roberts, College of General
Studies Student Government
Council president.

Starting next fall, a University-
wide Book Exchange Referral
Service will be available to stu-
dents who wish to buy or sell
used textbooks. This service is
sponsored by the student govern-
ments of CGS, the College of Arts
and Sciences and the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

“UBERS offers students a
chance to buy and sell textbooks
without having to deal with the
bookstore,” said Student

Pitt prof trades closet for classroom

A By David W. Matta
I For The Pitt News

In a time when colleges
across the country are respond-
ing to issues such as political
correctness and cultural diversi-
ty, some believe students can
only beneﬁt from being exposed
to a wide variety of people and
experiences.

For many students, having an
admittedly gay instructor for a
course at the University of
Pittsburgh would qualify as
exposu/re to a different person
and different experiences.

Gregory A. Spicer attempts to
bring his own personal diversity
as an out-of-the-closet gay
teacher to his classroom. He has
a graduate fellowship and is
working on his Ph.D. in rhetoric

_ at Pitt. He teaches classes in the

rhetoric and communication
department, such as argument
‘and public speaking.

, I. Greg Spicer makes his sexuali-

ty known to his classes, but he
didn’t_ always do this.‘ “My first
couple semesters here, it started
to become clear that some stu-
dents would make lthe assump-
tion Lhat I was gayl because of

‘ the kinds of examples that I

-u‘_sed_ in class.
“My work with rhetoric has a

, , lot to do with the rhetoric of ,.
’-qsexuality. Often my examples
"had to do with — in argument

class particularly —' issues con-
cerning women or issues con-
cerning sexual orientation-. I
noticed the first couple terms

that certain students were mak-
ing that assumption, but many
weren’t. The students that were
making that assumption I felt
pressure from because my not
telling them made it seem like I
was ashamedgor it was some-
how a secret, a dirty secret.

“The students who didn’t have
any idea I felt weren’t getting

. their money’s worth in terms of

education because here they
had a gay teacher and a chance
to understand or see somebody
gay as a role model or as some-
one that was in some sort of
position of authority.

“I felt like I wasn’t doing them
any service either, and I certain-
ly wasn’t doing any gay people
a service by not being out
because, of course, it was just
one more time when gay peo-
ple were being silenced, and I
was doing the silencing. I start-
ed trying to find creativeways
to let it be known but in a
relaxed and more natural way.”

Spicer said he has never
allowed his sexuality to affect or
influence his attitude toward
individual students in the class-
room. He also said that to his
knowledge no one has ever
dropped or withdrawn from his
classes because he is gay. , '

That isn’t an acceptable rea-

son for dropping out of a class,

as defined by the university
because of its anti-discrimination
policy, he said. if

Spicer knew from an early age
that he was attracted to men.
“From the time I was a child, 1

Roommates woes prevented when early steps taken

By Frank Porco
For The Pitt News

Those of you who were
able to get out and see Single
White Female this summer
became quite aware of some
of the unfortunate situations
one can encounter when liv-
ing with a roommate.

Though your problems may

not be quite the caliber of the
ones in the movie, during the
semester those little problems
add up and instead of your
roommate becoming an asset
to your life at college, he or
she can become a liability.

Those who have been at '

the university for at least a
year have heard some real
horror stories from students
who lived in residence halls
and also students who have
lived in apartments.

A lot of the problems deal
with just a simple lack of
communication or a misun-
derstanding between room-
mates, according to Cheryl
Campbell, Area Coordinator
in the Office of Residence
Life.

These little problems,
which seem trivial at first,
expand, and before you
know it you have one large
blowout near midsemester,
she said.

Understanding and getting

to know your roommate and

any habits he or she may
have early in the semester
can eliminate these problems,
Campbell said. .

“Communication is the
number-one bridging gap
between roommates’ different
ways and rules,” Campbell
said.

Learning and finding out
about.one another at the
beginning rather than not
talking leaves you with some
idea of how your roommate
is, making iteasier to get
along with him or her later
on.

Roommates should discuss
personal schedules with each
other, Campbell said.
Knowing when your room-
mate sleeps, eats, -has class
and likes to study helps you
to get a better perspective of
what he or she may be doing,
and being respectful of those
times can help you to get
along better, she said.

Scheduling some activities
together, such as cleaning the
room or apartment or having
guests, Campbell said, can
help relations with them fur-
ther down the road.

“Another helpful bit of
advice is being assertive with
your roommate,” ‘Campbell
said. If you happen to be
very touchy about your
belongings, tell your room-
mate right away. You can do

it in such a manner that you
don’t hurt their feelings, but
let them know now rather
than six weeks later.

Coming to an agreement as
to when guests can visit is a

small step that can save a"

large altercation in the future,
Campbell said.

She is also quick to note
that being respectful of your
roommates’ habits, likes and
dislikes is very important.
Many problems have come to
full boil sparked only by a
snide remark made to a per-
son by another member of his
or her floor, Campbell said.

If alcertain conflict were to
come up between you and
your roommate, Campbell
said, it should be discussed
immediately. Letting things
boil over will only prolong
the argument that will ensue
and intensify the anger
behind the argument, she
said.

Discussing your concerns
immediately is agreat way to
learn more about your room-
mate and possibly gain new
perspectives of him or her,
advises Campbell.

“Drawing contracts between
roommates is a step taken by
many to avoid hassles and
bad blood between room-
mates at the end of the
semester,” Campbell said.
Contracts can pertain to any-

thing from when to clean to
when guests can visit to when
quiet time is.

If the parties involved in
the contract can uphold their
ends of the bargain, then
contracts are a suitable
answer to avoiding problems,
Campbell said.

Compromise is a big part of
being a roommate, according
to Campbell. No two persons
are exactly alike, so tastes
and ideas over certain issues
will differ. Compromising on
issues that you and your
roommate don’t see eye to
eye on will help settle differ-
ences and provide a peaceful
end to the conflict, she said.

When making a decision
about guests or parties or
how late you’ll be coming in,
stop and briefly think about
how your roommate would
react, Campbell said. Don’t
cancel your plans if you don’t
see it going over big with

your roommate, but at least
inform him or her so he or
she knows what to expect.

Most important, if you want-

things to click with your
roommate, Campbell cautions
not to expect things to hap-
pen. Chances are you and
your roommate will not be
best friends, and there is no
law stating you should be.

In a situation where you
spend a lot of time together,
periods of time spent apart
works really well for room-
mates and helps themlget
along a lot better, she said.

If altercations with your
roommate keep occurring,
talk to your Resident
Assistant. Getting along with

bigger challenges you might

Sutherland acts

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

A few students can now pocket the
$lO,it Lakes to buy season football tick-
ets thanks to the view provided by _the
new Sutherland residence hall, V’ _

“You can watch a football game with-
out leaving your room,” Associate
Director for Construction John Sopcisak

, said,

“\\’/e’ll be ready when school starts.
The two dormitory towers will be done
when school starts. The commons
building in the center won’t be done;
it’s scheduled for Oct. 5. But everything
else will be in business up there,”
Sopcisak said.

The new residence hall has single
rooms, double rooms and suites_for four
and six people, according to Director of
Facilities Planning Ana Guzman.

It will house 612 students. Inside will

be a convenience store, cafeteria, sever-
al meeting rooms for seminars or stu-
dent activities, TV lounges, two study

lounges on each floor, laundry‘ facilities ’

and a computer lab.

The lab will ultimately have 50 sta-
tions, but right now only 42 are in oper-
ation. Residence hall computer lab users
will have access to all the same services

that are available at public labs, accord-

ing; to Manager of Computer«—La»b._.

Services David Schatz.

But Sutherland Hall is not the only

con1stru)ction‘project that has taken place __.
over the summer. “There are two big"
projects going on. One of them is the .

Although the digging
on the Cathedral of

lot of curiosity, the

from the Cathedral to

“The construction in

It’s never easy getting someone to»

H give you money. However, there is

some good_news for Pitt students: Pitt

" does have ‘a fair number of grants and

scholarships available to help finance an
education.
Pitt has two main types of ﬁnancial

. aid available to undergraduate students:

giftaid and self—help aid. Gift aid con-
sists of money students.don’t have to
pay back,» such as grants and scholar-
ships.‘ Self—help is aid students will
either have to work for or eventually
pay back. Most students will become all ,
too familiar with this last one: The
College Loan.

Whether you’ve been fortunate

A key to success lies in academic perfor-

mance. Executive Associate Director for
Pitt’s'Office of Admissionsand Financial
Aid Kevin Altomari encourages students,
especially first-year students, to keep
those grades up.

“Students need to be concerned about

 what types of financial aid they have,

what types of aid they may qualify for
and what the conditions are for renewal
of that aid. For instance, if they have an
academic scholarship, they can keep

that scholarship provided they maintain

of financial aid available to Pitt students

upon graduating from high school but
you positively excel here at Pitt, you
may be eligible for an Upperclass Merit
Scholarship. “You have to have com-
pleted at least 24 credits at the
University of Pittsburgh and have a 3.75
GPA,” Altomari said.

“But it’s not a terrific amount of
money; it’s a $500 scholarship. With the
exception of that, that’s all in terms of
academic money that can be awarded
to a student after their [first] year that
this office controls. There may be
departmental money in some cases 
for instance, engineering may offer
some money to upperclass students.
They may want to consider taking
advantage of that, but they’d have to
contact their school and/or department
to find out what the qualiﬁcations are.”

Altomari cautioned that students
should not expect to find a solution to
their college financial dilemma by look-
ing for money in their major. ‘‘I think to
give that advice is somewhat inappro-
priate because in many cases in the aca-
demic departments, the money is

~' nonexistent.”

That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
check out your department to see what
might be offered. The chemistry depart-
ment, for example, has a number of
grants for its majors. “We actually offer
quite a bit of ‘financial aid. It varies from
year to year. The aid is based primarily

_on the students’ QPA but_also on their

involvement in the undergraduate pro-

gram. We have a very involved student

program.” Undergraduate program coor-
dinator George Bandick said.

or-:~—-*o:><t11 rnzsoroszioo

Sophomores and juniors are awarded
the main chemistry scholarships of
amounts from $500 to $2000, and
Bandick said there’s more.

“We have a lot of awards, several
$100 and $50 awards,” Bandick said.
“We make those decisions on financial
aid not based on financial need; it’s on
academic merit and program involve-
ment. I think it’s a very good idea for
the students to know what’s out there,
to be aware of how their academic per-
formance gets them these awards.”

Aside from academic grants there are
need-based aid awards available at Pitt.
Most are based on financial need as
determined by the respective programs.
Other options you may want to explore
include the college work-study pro-
gram, resident assistantships and ROTC
scholarships.

Filing for financial aid through the

university itself is another option. _

Altomari said most financial aid coming
from the university is based on a stu-
dent’s financial-need budget. “When we
award financial aid in terms of building
a student’s budget, we’re going to look
at the cost of education, tuition fees,
book allowance. ' .

“Then we look at the housing situa-
tion: if the student is an on—campus resi-

dent, off-campus resident or a com--"

muter. There are different budgets. You
could be a College of Arts and Science
student who is a commuter and have a

different budget than an on—campus stu-
dent who is a dormitory resident,” .

Altomari said. .

found dead ends instead, maybe it’s
time for The College Loan. This is an
experience in itself, and it will take
some time to fill out plenty of forms
and send them to a number of institu-
tions. You must apply to the university,
fill out a financial-aid form, send copies
of your own and your parents’ tax
return ‘forms, most likely visit a bank
and then proceed to wade through the
various in-state/out—of—state loans avail-
able to college students.

The technical side of financial aid is
probably the most important part of all.
Here are some tips to keep in mind:

Read carefully everything sent to you
by the financial-aid office. Sometimes
the school may make allowances for
any additional aid awarded to you,
which may decrease what it is giving
you. Be informed. Know what you defi-
nitely have and don’t count on what the
school is allowed to take back.

Pay attention to deadlines, and BE
ON TIME. Everything must be received,
not just postmarked, by that deadline
date. Don’t procrastinate (despite that
college tendency). In fact, send those
forms in EARLY.

Stop by Bruce Hall and pick up the
booklet “How to get Financial Aid.”
Besides being helpful concerning who
to send what to by when, there’s a back
page entitled “Little-Known Sources of
Scholarships and Grants,” complete with

. phone numbers to help you find the
books listed. 

Finally, if after everything you ARE
awarded aid, remember to sign your aid
acceptance form and send it back; ~. -

Flicks, trips, expo's

fill PPC fall calendar

Edward Goldhahn
Staff Writer

Sleeping all day Saturday is great, but there are many events
going on that you may find worth getting up for. The Pitt Program
Council has planned feature movies, discounted trips to Steeler
games, cultural art exhibits, cruises and more for the fall schedule.

If movies are what you enjoy, the program council shows fea-
ture films every Friday and Saturday for only two dollars. This fall
you can see Lethal Weapon 3, Tango and Cash, Waynes World,
Basic Instinct, Monty Python and the Holy Graz'l,'as well as some
free sneak previews of new releases. “All of the movies are shown
in David Lawrence auditorium,” program—council Coordinator
Donna Lim said. .

If you’re into fitness, the program council will be offering aero-
bic and Cardiostep bench classes beginning Sept. 16. A self-
defense class will also be offered along with aerobics: All students
interested in these classes pay approximately one-third less than
non-students. . -

Also for you health nuts, the program council organizes a
Cathedral Climb in November. According to Assistant Director of
Student Activities Tom Misuraca, participants climb all 36 flights of
the Cathedral’s stairs. “Last year’s winner did it under three min-
utes,” Misuraca said.

For those interested in theater and arts, the program council will

host an animated art sale at the end of September and will also
host the Black Artist show in October.

T he- council\ will also be selling discounted tickets to students
for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre company’s production of the
Nutcracker on Dec. 13.

In the mood to be social?.The’program council has lots of fun
activities planned for you to meet people. Homecoming weekend
you can join in the keg-roll contest or sit back and watch the laser
show. ,

The council also has a cruise planned on the Gateway Clipper
downtown. And you’ll be sure to meet new friends at the Twister
tournament in October.

You can get a complete calendar marked with all the program
council’s activities, times, dates and locations in one book called
the Miscellaneous Pages (Misc). t .

“You can pick a copy up at the Union information desk, the
Office of Student Activities or here at the [Pitt Program Council]
office. The best place to get one is at the book store,” Misuraca
said- - ’

Anything that will be scheduled last minute will be posted in
The Pitt‘/Vews, such as guest lecturers, Lim said.

Now that you know how to get your full useout of the pro-

_g gram council, you may want to become a member. Since all of

the activities are set up by students, anyone can help out.
“lnterested students can come to the student activities fair on Sept.
1 at 6:50 in Forbes Quad and talk to us,” Lim said.

The Student Health service is
designed as your primary source
of health care during your stu-

. dent years. It is not designed for

emergency care or hospitaliza-
tion. Health insurance should fill
this void. Most ’students;ar'e cov-

eredunder health plans when’
they come to college, but stu-
dents should know when their
coverage ends. Many insurance‘

l

plans drop dependent children
at 19 years of age. F o r
those who have no coverage,
the university endorses a plan
that can be purchased from a
private insurance company.
Every enrolled student is mailed
a brochure about this insurance
plan in August. Additional
brochures are available at the
Student Health Service in
Brackenridge Hall.

Students who have a greater
interest in health care on cam-

certainly in part. The number-two
individual person on the campus
is the Provost Donald Henderson.
The budget process this year
reﬂected academic concerns with
its emphasis on libraries and
resources.

PN: Do you think you've been
treated fairly by the media this
year?

O’Connor: Interesting question.
A university as complex as this
one is very difficult to communi-
cate and very difficult to explain
with real understanding in sound-
bite format in a catch-phrase
description. So to the extent that
that has been done, I think that
mechanism of communicating
the richness and complexity of a
place like this, complexity in both
the good and complexity in the
difficult situations, doesn’t really
present what the institution is
about, and that is a struggle that
television commentators and
people limited to 500 words face.
And so to that extent, the media
really doesn’t present the richness
of the complications.

PN: What are the top priorities of

V the university for this upcoming

year?

O’Connor: Surviving; no, that’s
not right. I think the top priorities
really are those we have demon-
strated through the resource dis-
tribution. There certainly are
attempts to enhance our l_ibrary,
both the acquisitions and the
physical space of our library.
There are priorities in terms of
program development the
provost can speak to. I certainly
have a priority lhat this year I
really want to explore what we
can do to enhance our under-
graduate educational requirement
— that’s both a physical environ-

‘ ment in terms_of classroom struc-

ture and also the intellectual
requirement interms of who’s in
the classroom.

PN: This past year you had a few
dealings with the Black Action
Society and other minority
groups pertaining to minority
retention at Pitt. Is this a big con-
cern of yours and will it be a pri-
ority for the upcoming year?

O’Connor: Yes. There is a need
really for enhanced retention
across the board. But certainly
we need to find out why minori-
ty students who are leaving the
institution in good academic

standing are doing so. That’s one
of the things I’d like to work with
the Black Action Society this year
to address.

PN: Last year you had to make a
decision regarding ROTC; any
reflections on that? .

O’Connor: As long as the ROTC
holds to its current policies I
think that that policy will create
difficulty. Clearly it’s created diffi-
culty for me in that I’m not com-

fortable with the decision I had.

to make last year. I certainly
would have preferred to make a
different decision, but I really
didn’t feel as though I could at
the time. I did promise to contin-
ue to explore that situation and I
will continue to do so.

PN: Where do you see Pitt in 10
years? -

O’Connor: Pitt in 10 years is
going to be, if we try to do things
right, an amazingly interesting
and exciting place to be. I think
we’ll be a real factor in communi-
ty development, as it already has

been, and I think it will be seen

as having this marvelously
enhanced program in a number
of areas.

PN: How would you rate the
undergraduate program that stu-
dents receive here as. compared
to other schools? Are there any
schools you can compare us to?

O’Connor: I can only compare
you in terms of my own experi-
ence with those institutions I
know fairly well. I think the
undergraduate education here
compares favorably. What I think
is generally not appreciated

throughout the United States is
that undergraduate educations
have taken on different character-
istics at different institutions. So if
you were to compare an under-
graduate education at a small lib-
eral arts college where the classes
rnight be small and there’s a very
intense interaction between the
professor and student, that would
be very different than, for exam-

ple, a large university. There's a
difference in the kind of
ambiance in an urban institution
versus a college-town institution.
A college town, regardless
whether the university is a large
one or a small liberal arts, the fact
that you're bumping into people
all the time creates a different
sense of familiarity and conversa-
tion than if you're in an urban
environment and you get into a
bus to go home after class or you
live.a couple miles off campus.

All of those characteristics affect *

the quality, the perceived quality,
of undergraduate educations. So
at a small college town you might
feel a little bit more familiar with
the faculty member that you
bump into shopping and get to
ask the question you couldn’t ask
in class than you would in a large
city like this. But overall I think
the undergraduate education is
good; I‘ think there are things we
can do to make it better.

PN:.You’ve brought in a couple
colleagues from the University of
North Carolina. Other than the
obvious, that you know them
well, did you bring them in
because they’ll bring a fresh per-

’ spective or you hope they’ll insti-

tute programs you saw working
at UNC?

hot hell than toil under the odi-

O’Connor: 1 think the principal
reason they were brought in is
because I think they’re the best in
the business. Their perspectives
certainly will be fresh in that they
have never experienced
Pittsburgh before, but it’s not so
much their perspectives are fresh
— they’re extremely thoughtful
people. They are very responsive
to the people that work with
them, they are very willing to
address difficult issues and I think
they have always, at least for the
time I’ve known them, demon-
strated to be very sensitive and
responsible human beings.

PN: Do you have any plans to
bring anyone from UCLA, or are
you finished with your plans?
0’Connor: No, not at this point,
but one never knows at an insti-
tution like this. There is always
turnover and you’re always look-
ing for good people.

PN: Now that [Vice Chancellor
for Business] Dr. Uohnl DeVitto is
in place are you finished with
your “cast of characters?” _

O’C0nnor: Again, there is always
turnover. Dr. [Thomas] Detre
{head of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center] will be
retiring and that will require a
search committee, and they’re still

people we’re looking for, but

thankfully those positions are
currently held by good people.

PN: In the past many people said
the medical center ruled the uni-
versity. Do you believe that per-
ception was correct when you
came here?

O’Connor: No.

PN: You spoke of a balance of
power between the medical cen-
ter and university. Are you trying
to change that balance or are you
content with how it is now?

O’Connor: The medical center is
very, very large. First of all, the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center is an organization of the
University of Pittsburgh. It is
responsible for the management
of our clinical venues. As such it

would have to invent it. It had
been functionin'gex.tremely well
long before I got here. There are
people  who are superb man-
agers in that environment and
have been very helpful to me 
in fact, they bring insights that
affect the entire university much
the. same way other individuals
on campus have insights that are
very helpful to the University of

PN: Why wasn’t there a search
committee for the [Senior Vice
Chancellor of Health
Administration Jeffrey] Romoff
position?

O’Connor: The position really is
a reorganization. Mr. Romoff will
not be doing anything other than
what he has been doing in the
past, and it was a clarification of
those responsibilities. Mr.
Romoffs former title was vice
chancellor for health sciences and
executive vice president of the
lUPMCl. Dr. Detre’s title was pres-
ident of IUPMCI and senior vice
chancellor for health sciences.
What we did is to simply split
that title, split that function. Mr.
Romoff as executivepvice presi-
dent is the chief operating officer
of the IUPMCI, and all I did was
retitle those positions. So I did
not perceive a need to conduct a
search when he clearly does that
very, very well. But do let me
make the point that I did ask  It
was not a decision that was fabri-
cated by my, neurons in absence
of any other kind of input.

PN: How would you like to see
the campus change structurally in
the future? Are you in favor of a

big conglomerate library?

O’Connor: No, I think the Jay of
a massive singular kind of library
is probably past. I think what you
will find in 10 years is our stu-
dents, faculty and staff looking
for information, punching in their
computer and accessing informa-
tion, be it in a journal, a book, a
monograph, yet that book or
monograph could be in the biol-
ogy library, chemistry library,
I-Iillman Library or down in Falk
Library and it won’t make any
difference to the user. So trying
to bring together all those things
that are now distributed 1 think
would not make a lot of sense
right now. That does not mean
we do not need increased physi-
cal space for libraries. I think
clearly one of our top priorities is
the expansion of Hillman Library.
That is important because
I-Iillman does house the collec-
tion that is core to campus, and
in an urban environment the
library also functions or can func-
tion lasl it does at many urban
institutions as really a place of
socialization. I don’t mean card

Union but merely sitting down,

Catholic family, and everyone
else in Spicer’s family is in het-
erosexual marriages. His family
has been supportive of his sexu-
al orientation since he came out
of the closet. His brother Rich,
who he is the closest to of his
siblings, is very supportive and
asks him about his life.

Greg doesn’t speak to his
father for reasons not related to
his being gay. In fact, he
stopped talking to_ his father
before he came out of the clos-
et, so one of his brothers was
the one who told their father
about Greg’s sexual orientation.
When he told his mother he was
gay, her reaction was very sup-
portive. .

“My mom was very cool
about it. You can’t even put in
print what she said. It was just
too cool. She said something
on the order of, ‘Well, if people
don’t like it, that you’re gay,
then they can go f—k them-
selves.’ That was a quote from
Mom Spicer.” ”

There wasn't an actual
moment when Spicer realized
that he was gay, but over time
and through experience his sex-
ual identity became clear to him.

“When I fell in love with my
best friend in college, I realized
that it was more intense than the
feelings that I was having for
many of the women that I went
out with. It seemed sort of more

real or more intense to me.
Then I went to graduate school
in Illinois and actually became
involved with a man romantical-
ly. Then it was pretty clear that
being with men seemed to be
more satisfying. So it was sort of
like a process of realization
rather than a moment.”

Despite being attracted to
women at times, he is pretty
confident that he is gay rather
than bisexual. “I certainly find
some women attractive, but alto-
gether at this time I’m really
much more oriented toward
men, erotically oriented toward
men. So I guess the word ‘gay’
would be more appropriate the
way it’s used.”

Greg Spicer came to Pitt in the
fall of 1988. He has been teach-
ing in the rhetoric and commu-
nication department since then,
and he was a College of Arts
and Sciences adviser during the
1990-1991 school year.

Spicer is a member of the gay-
activist group Cry Out! ACT UP
in Pittsburgh. ACT UP stands for
the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power. Cry Out! is a lesbian, gay
and-bisexual protest group.
Because of the AIDS crisis, Cry
Out! also identifies itself with a
chapter‘ of ACT UP, which is a
worldwide movement to deal
with the problems of AIDS.

Along with another graduate
student, he reactivated the

Alliance his first summer here, in
1989. He said he was very
involved with BiGALA his first
two years, and he is still a com-
mittee chair in the organization.

He has had some involvement
with Queer Nation, which is a
direct-action group that func-
tions as a coalition to plan and
organize actions and protests
against organizations of authori-
ty and power, like the govern-
ment, or against the actions or
work of other groups.

Gay people not only face
coming out of the closet to oth-
ers, but they also face the act of
coming out of the closet for
themselves.

Spicer said, “I guess falling in
love with my best friend in col-
lege meant coming out _to
myself or realizing to myself.
There was a difference between

the way society represented the

perfect relationship and the way
many people have their relation-
ships. Then I thought for me it
would be impossible for me to
live up to their ideals. I guess
when I started telling other peo-
ple was after I got involved with
a guy at Southern Illinois
University, where I got my mas-

'ter’s degree.

“Then it became harder and
harder. He was in the closet. We
were both very secretive about
our relationship for fear that
other people would react badly,
our friends would react badly.

We had a lot of mutual friends. '

We had been friends before we
became involved. So we were
both pretty secretive.

“The huge stress of having a
relationship like that made me
realize how impossible it would

friends and then more and more
people. It’s just been a process
ever since then, and it’s just
been a process because most
people assume that you’re
straight unless you tell them,
believe it or not.” ~

Since Spicer decided to tell his
classes that he is gay, he has
had to adopt a method of tact-
fully informing his students.

“The first couple weeks I
decide always to just let people
get comfortable with the class. It
would seem like a really strange
thing to just bring up the first
day or so. What I do instead is
wait for an appropriate time
when there would be some
other reason for that information
to be known.

“The closest I’ve ever come [to
just telling them outright I was
gay] was in my evening class
this semester when we were dis-
cussing questions of identity in
argument class. We were talking
about the problem of analyzing
people's arguments when they
generalize about groups of peo-

ple. It actually happened quite‘

late in the semester in that class.

“I said something about the
Irish lesbian/gay organization
marchingin the St. Patrick’s Day
Parade. ...There was a moment
of silence in the class in which
people actually looked stunned
that I had made that announce-
ment. _But that’s the closest I’ve
ever come to actually just saying
something like, ‘Hi, I’m Greg,
and I happen to be gay,_so get
over it.’”

According to Spicer, the gen-
eral reactions of students to hav-

ing an openly gay instructor are
very positive.

‘‘I only hear good things. A
student came out to me [in one
of my classes] before I actually
came out to the class because of
things that I had said that were
certain subcultural cues to that
person. There are other students
that I have had that subsequent-
ly either came out or talked
about how they had to deal
with their own homophobia.

“I know that students have
come up to me and said that
they really just had an amazing
experience and they really liked
the class, and I sense that what
they’re trying to say in some
ways is that part of that experi-
ence was having a gay teacher,
that this is something that they
knew. ‘

‘‘They’ve had gay teachers
before, or some of them have
thought about the fact that some
of their teachers may have been
gay, but there was no appropri-
ate way to bring that up because
the teacher hadn’t made it a safe
topic.”

Spicer said there are some
serious implications to be con-
sidered because of the number
of students who have
approached him.

“I can’t help but to think that
a significant percentage of all of
my students are gay, or lesbian,
or bisexual, or in some other
way struggling with sexual mis-
ery over not living up to a par-
ticular stereotype of what the
American family should be or
what relationships should be. I
can’t help but hope that I have
some kind of impact on those
students."

PN: What role do you see former
Pitt President Wesley Posvar play-
ing at the university? Will he ever
be fundraising or teaching?
O'Connor: Actually Professor
Posvar will be teaching a course
in political science this year. It's
going to be a fascinating course.
It will be for graduate students
and perhaps some seniors in poli
sci. 

PN: Are you going to be teaching
this year?

O'Connor: Yes. I'll probably do
the same thing I did last year:
team teach a developmental biol-
ogy course and maybe the gradu-
ate mini course we do over in the

’ biology department

ﬁ"3‘ward to most in this upcoming

simply a free referral service,
it’s a program that all Pitt stu-
dents —-— graduate, undergradu-
ate, traditional and non-tradi-
tional — can take advantage
of."

The referral service will offer

. I a daily list. of available books.

/ .
\

‘Prices will be set by the stu-
dents selling their books, and
no money will be exchanged
through the office.

Students can call the UBERS
office with the name, edition
and condition of books they

wantjtosell. Interested buyers’ -

can call the office to get names
and phone numbers of sellers.
No names or phone‘ numbers
will be posted. ‘

. The service will run one
week before each semester and
continue until the end of the
add/drop period.

This is the 15th attempt to
maintain an independent book
service at Pitt, St. Clair said.
Problems with past attempts,
such as stolen money and diffi-
culties with collecting books
and money’, were taken into
consideration when drawing up
this ‘system.

4 “If we get a real diplomatic
effort between students and

culty, we should be able to

eventually step on some toes at
the Book Center,” Roberts said.
Mary Bonach, director of the

. Book Center, said she doesn't

think UBERS will affect the
bookstore’s business or benefit
Pitt students.

“Students, especially seniors,
won’t want to take the risk of
listing a book inthe spring and
waiting until fall to sell it,”
Bonach said. “If a ‘new edition-
comes out over the summer,
they lose completely. I don’t
think students. are willing to
take those chances.”

“We’re hoping that the possi- '

bility of eventually getting

v twice as much money‘ for a

textbook will encourage stu-
dents to hold out over the
breaks and use our service," St."
Clair said. A

away for about two weeks. No, I
think the second year is always
an interesting year. You've heard
it said about the sophomore
slump. I think in a subconscious
way you look for a similarity of
tempo. You’re through the sea-
sons again, and in an uncon-
sciousway you begin to pick up
differences with this year to the
previous year; Part of those dif-
ferences will be I'm no longer
new. I know a lot more people
here than I did before. I’m able
to pick up the phone when I
need something to get the right
individual responding to it, or at
least I think the right individual.
So in that sense I think there will
be fewer surprises, and hopefully
the fewer surprises will mean
there will be a lot more positive
activity going on on campus.

PN: This past year you participat-

ed in .a lot of open forums to

obtain students’ input. Do you
plan to do the same next year?
Do you think they worked well?

O’Connor: It was interesting.
The first one I think worked well;
the questions were about do we
do secret research, ROTC, safety
issues, and I think it brought a

 

number of student concerns to
the floor and it was pretty well
attended. The second one to a
certain extent went over those
issues again and added the issue
of minority recruitment and
retention. The third one I think
again’ brought to the ﬂoor those
issues and there was a concern
addressed for childcare,
enhanced childcare for students;
that one [was] not particularly
well attended. Then the fourth
one nobody showed up. The

_provost, [vice chancellor of

Student Affairs] Dr.l\lf/illiaml
Harmon, [Athletic Director] Oval
Jaynes and I were sitting there by
ourselves. So I think it is worth-
while. I don’t know if we have
any scheduled, but I'm perfectly
willing to participate. I'll talk to

.[Student Government Board pres-

ident] Gil Golden and see what

_ his thoughts are.

PN: Do you think we have an
apathetic student body? _

O'Connor: Oh, no. I don’t think
so. I wouldn't characterize them
as apathetic at all. All you have to
do is take a look at what they do:
there’s the blood drive that was
so successful; I went over one

Saturday at Forbes Quad and stu-
dents had taken the. time to put
together this whole massive array
of games and entertainment, just
taking care of children that were
challenged in different ways, just
giving the parents some time to
be together — the Hand in Hand
festival. You look and the stu-
dents are involved in so many
things. There's peer counseling
and peer group involvement with
freshmen. No, they aren’t apa-
thetic. It's again when the popu-
lation of students, when you’ve
got a campus that has an awful
lot of evening classes and I'm
sure a‘ substantial percentage of
our students have jobs, I think
they probably spend less time _on
campus. But that’s typical of an
urban institution. I don’t think
they're apathetic at all. I think
they've put together some super
programs, they're really interested
and I just hope they stay that
way. -

PN: At the Staff Association
Council you focused and‘sai_d we
need a change of attitude in the
university. Does that change in
attitude apply to students, and if
so how do you plan to get that?

How is it to be achieved?

O'Connor: It's an interesting
question. I don't know the gener-
al attitude of the students. I
would hope the undergraduate
students that come to the univer-
sity come with a real sense of
intellectual adventure, that they
are curious and excited about
their prospects. And I certainly
hope that when they leave the
university we haven't done any-
thing to impair that sense of
adventure and that sense of

curiosity. I would hope that ‘

we’ve enhanced it if we’ve done
anything to it

how long you plan to stay-at the

It's also time for O’Connor to make the right decision regarding

on gays and lesbians, they should not be permitted on campus.
Though the military may bring money into Pitt, is it right to trade

Are you safe?  

  Campus police need
help of community

As we begin the new school
year, the safety and security of our
faculty, staff and students contin-
ues to be a priority issue at the
university. I am frequently asked
the question, “Are we safe at the
University of Pittsburgh?”

Unfortunately our society is such
that safety can not be guaranteed
anywhere in our country. With the
continued growth of drug prob-
lems, especially involving young
people, we see an increase in

In addition you will see
some changes in the way that
information from the Department
of Public Safety is disseminated.
We intend to publish crime bul-
letins along with safety tips on a
regular basis.

I am frequently asked if we have
enough police officers and guards
to provide adequate protection.
Every police agency that I know of
would like to have more officers.

Budget cuts leaving
students unprotected

To begin to address this ques-
tion, one must first define a
“secure campus."‘Perhaps it would
be more practical to ask the ques-
tion: “Does Pitt’s Department of
Public Safety provide students with
a reasonably secure campus?”

My short answer to this question
is an emphatic “No — I do not
believe it does,” although the rea-
sons for this answer are somewhat
complex. It is a fact that, in recent
years, the Department of Public

inadequacy ofthe number of offi-
cers on any given shift can be
evinced by the fact that three offi-
cers used to share the responsibili-
ty of patrolling around the
Litchfield Towers, the Schenley
Quadrangle area and the William
Pitt Union. Now, just one officer
patrols the entire area. Imagine if
this officer responds to a call about
an obscene phone call on the 18th
floor of Tower B, leaving at least
six other residence halls and the

over the past 15 to 20 years the

and developing new programs

Working with the Student"
Government Board and the

gram throughout the entire
campus.

for students does not currently
exist on this campus; however I
feel that it would be much
more worthwhile to examine
what is being done right now
to help improve the situation.

Ln the past year since the
chancellor has been in office,
he has addressed this important
situation in a thorough and
thoughtful manner. As a result
of a task force created by Dr.
O’Connor and comprised of
several students, concerned
faculty members and adminis-
trators, much has been learned
about student safety concerns
and what Pitt can do to address
these concerns. In addition, 37
additional universities which
responded to a task-force sur-
vey provided the task force
with many examples of how
other institutions handle their
public safety and transportation
concerns.

In addressing the conclu-
sions of the task force, includ-

The program is simple. The
community provides additional
eyes and ears for the police. You
will let us know when something
out of the ordinary occurs in
the areas where you work or live.
We, in turn, will let you know
what kinds of crime are occurring
in those same areas. This exchange
of information is essential to the
development of the partnerships
that are so vital to our success
in minimizing the incidence of
crime.

We plan to have ‘several crime
seminars during the school year.
Issues such as date rape, theft pre-
vention, alcohol abuse, and self-
defense are just a few of the topics
being covered.

The first program is scheduled
for Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1992,
from 7 to 9 p.m., in the Graduate
School of Public Health
Auditorium. Date rape is one of
the topics that will be addressed.
We will announce the dates, times,
locations and topics of these pro-

grams in The Pitt News-. We urge

calls for service and deploy our
personnel accordingly. Our objec-
tive is to provide you with quality
service.

But we also need your help.
Work with us in the development
of a strong crime-watch program
and attend the safety seminars. If
you have any ideas about programs
we should develop and offer, or
how we can improve existing pro-
grams, please contact me or my
staff.

Read the bulletins and safety tips
that we distribute, and pass the
information on to friends and co-
workers. Be safety—conscious.
Don’t go out alone late at night.
Keep your doors and windows
locked. Don’t leave articles such as
books or purses unattended in
public places, and communicate
with the Department of Public
Safety. We will be communicating
with you.

Pittsburgh.

very rapid growth, in regard to
both population and boundaries.

As a result of extensive budget
cuts, the number of patrolling offi-
cers for any given shift has been
on the decline, apparently without
due consideration for the increased
area which the university occupies.
This year, approximately $77,550
has been cut from the department’s
operating budget. Last year, the
director of the Department of
Public Safety said, “If we are faced
with another budget cut, it be
made up by a loss of personnel.”

It is easy to see how this loss of
officers affects the ability of the
department to provide a reason-
able degree of security on and
around the campus area. For exam-
ple, currently the night shift, which
is from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., utilizes
only two patrol cars and about six
officers on foot to protect our
entire campus, which at night and
on weekends is comprised primari-

ly of students.

One specific example of the

ing a lack of priority on the
part of the past administration to
supervise the Department of Public
Safety and a severely deficient
campus transportation system, the
chancellor has made several signif-
icant improvements. First, we can
look for improved transportation
this year, highlighted by an addi-
tional campus bus and the replace-
ment of the Van-Call service (spon-
sored by Student Government
Board, the Office of Student Affairs
and the Department of Public
Safety) by a central dispatcher.
Second, Dr. Ben Tuchi, Senior
Vice—Chancellor for Business and
Finance, and his assistant, Mr. John
DeVitto, have been brought from
the University of North Carolinato
help address campus safety issues
by bringing their combined experi-
ence and expertise to Pitt.

Other major changes, I am sure,
will occur in time to help promote
the security of Pitt’s students, but
th'ese changes will necessarily
require time to be perfected.

Avisittothe "O" a must for all first-year students

Welcome first-year students.
By now you have completed
the grueling task of registra-
tion, endured the agony of
Add/_Drop and are ready to
embark on your academic
experience — but wait! There
is still one more thing that
needs to be done before you

can truly be deemed a “col— T

lege” student. No, it’s not
Freshman Studies; it’s a pil-
grimage to the Original Hot
Dog Shop.

The Original Hot Dog Shop,
or “O” as it is known to the
locals, is a college tradition
dating all the way back to the
time when Socrates taught
Plato. The Original Hot Dog
Shop is known by many
names: The Big O, the O and,
a personal favorite, “The Dirty
O.” Do not be confused by
any of these names; they all
mean the same thing — good
food. (I didn’t say great, just

.good)

By now your taste buds are
surely anticipating the food.
Where is it you ask? Just fol-
low the trail of smashed

T709 Evil 
Snooze
Button

Attention all sophomores and

this could very well be the most

read. These words are not about
the hole in the ozone layer or
nuclear devastation. Those issues
pale in comparison. What I am
writing about is of much more
immediate conoem to you — the
Evil Snooze Button!

I would go so far to say that
these words rank right up there
with great historical documents

like the Magna Carta. If you do ,

nothing else this year, I recom-
mend framing this article and plac-
ing it over your alarm clock.

The snooze button was created
by a Soviet scientist working as a
spy in _a United States alann-clock
factory. The goal was to make
American citizens lazy and there-
fore make this country ripe for
takeover. While the Soviet Union

.collapsed before the opportunity

for takeover arose, it nevertheless
accomplished part of its goal, i.e.,
made Americans lazy (according to
my sources in Japan).

This laziness, caused by the
Soviets, is what is responsible for
our economic difficulties. How do
we change it? The answer is not to
lower interest rates — eliminate
the snooze button and watch this
economy boom
. You, too, will be more produc-
tive if you can avoid this trap.
However I am worried about your
capability. Here is the soenario. It is

. your first year of college. Your

alarm clock goes off at 8 a.m. and

save it for the cheese (morevon
this later)."

The “O” is just across the
street from the law school
building on the corner of
Forbes and Bouquet Street. It
may be “scary” the first time
you go there, but college is
full of scary things — get used
to it. At night, the “O” is a
mecca of entertainment. Just
ask any one of the police offi-
cers located outside of it. For
your first trip to the “O,” I sug-
gest the daytime.

When you first go in the

“O,” don’t look scared. The

employees are trained to rec-
ognize this, and you’ll never
get waited on. Have your
money ready and make plenty

of eye contact; Look around
the place. Enjoy the atmos-
phere, knowing full well that
your parents wouldn’t be
caught dead in this place. The
“O” is for the young.

Video games run amok in
the restaurant, hiding in the
corners. Look above the
counter; notice all the specials?
Forget ‘em. Order your dog
and find a seat. Here’s a tip -
go up the stairs" to the “Top of
the O.” Sometimes it’s air con-
ditioned, and it’s slightly more
quiet provided there isn’t a
game on the projection televi-
sion. Another important tip:
DON’T try ordering fries at the
same counter you order the
hot dog. Don’t ask for the
logic behind this —— you’ll
understand in due time.

Hot dogs and the rules
that govern them: The “O” is
famous for its hot dogs, hence
the name “Original Hot Dog

Shop." Although the dogs are

a bit pricey (around $2.00)
they are definitely worth it.

- The dogs are lined up military

style on the grill — row upon

row of franks. Toppings avail-
able are ketchup, relish, onion,
pickles, a great spicy brown
mustard and chili — all of
these are free. Cheese, on the
other hand, will cost you. A
dog with cheese rings in at a.
hefty $2.75. My theory on
cheese is as follows: if you’re
paying for the hot dogs, skip
the cheese; if somebody else is
paying what are you?
Stupid? Of course you want
cheese. Say the word “cheese”
at the counter and your hot
dog will disappear from view.
Only after the cheese has been
steamed on will your hot dog
reappear.

When I was young (younger,
-that is), my brother and I
would get a combination so
vile we named it the “Atomic
Dog.” The name referred to
the breath of the person who
consumed the “A” dog. An
Atomic Dog consists of chili,
cheese (you’re not paying),

mustard, pickle, relish and"

onion. If you have no plans or
dates for the next few days, at
least you’ll know why.

Pizza: Pizza is relatively new
to the ,“O.” It’s also relatively
cheap for the “O.” How can
they make it so cheap?
Volume, volume, volume — a
plain cheese pizza will only
set you back about $3.50.
More than one college student
has been known to live on “O”
pizza for an extended period
of time. Only a novice would
order a slice of pizza from the
“O.” It costs over a buck for
one slice, as compared to
three and a half bucks for a
whole. You don’t even have to
take microeconomics to under-
stand that. Students from out
of town, here is a special tip
just for you: if Mom and Dad
send you money (God bless
them), here is a q.uick and
easy way to come out of col-
lege ahead. Get two friends, or
any two people for that matter,
kick in a buck each — $1, can
you believe it? — and all of
your nutritional needs are met
for the day. A plain cheese ‘'0'’
pizza contains three of the
four food groups, breads, dairy

Incident shakes student's faith in professors

I had an experience recently that first
shocked me and then annoyed me to the
point of writing this column. For the only
time in my college career (now in its last
semester) I was unceremoniously dismissed
from a professor’s office under circum-
stances that raise several questions about
the rights of students and the responsibili-
ties of professors.

To relate the story brieﬂy, I had been hir-

ing my time out as an economics tutor for -

introductory level courses. Two of my stu-
dents had the same professor, who had
assigned but not explained a group of
problems that I also had some questions
about. On June 1 I went to him and asked
about the problems. He refused to explain
anything to me on the grounds that 1) I
was not his student and 2) I would beneﬁt
monetarily from his help. I am glad to say
that such examples’ of uncaring and disre-

‘ gard for responsibility by the professors of
- our faculty are rare. But in short, I think

this incident an outrage and it raises several
important issues: 1) What rights do under-
graduates of our university have; for exam-
ple, when are we our professors’ students?
2) What responsibilities, outside of lectur-
ing and grading, do professors have to us?
The professor stated that I was not his
student, which shocked me more than any-
thing else that day. I could only feebly

reply, “Aren’t all students your students?”
Does a professor really only have a respon-
sibility toward those students that the uni-
versity pays him to lecture? Does he not
bear some responsibility to any student
who seeks his knowledge andlcounsel?
Doesn’t a student at this university have the

Morgan
Marietta

right when he or she visits a professor’s
office, if not to have his questions treated
at length, at least to be treated respectfully?
I believe we do, and I believe we should
insist upon it.

The hypocrisy of this incident is blatant:
What if this professor’s professors had
refused to teach him on the grounds that
he might go and be paid to teach someone
else? I always thought that a professor was
one who added to the body of knowledge
and taught this to others, aiding mankind
— any member of it who came to him
(particularly during his stated office hours)
— with the same love of learning that he
possesses. I intend to be a professor myself
someday, and if anyone does not believe
that this is what the professionis, please
don’t tell me; I’d rather keep my illusion.
But I know it is not an illusion. There are

many fine professors here who truly
believe that “the teacher hasn’t taught until
the student has learned.”

The second relevant question concerns
the responsibilities of professors outside of
classroom teaching. Does the job descrip-
tion stop here, or is there more? A world-

class university such as ours is much more

than this. (And if there is any doubt in your
mind that Pittsburgh is world class just
check the rankings, facilities and faculty
that we have.) It is a place where under-
graduates can be exposed to everything
they need to grow intellectually, socially
and professionally. And professors are not
relegated to only the first of these. Socially
and professionally they have a large role in
encouraging, guiding and serving as role
models for students. Professors have to eat
lunch, and undergraduates are not such
boring company. Our intellectual develop-
ment is also not fulﬁlled only through lec-
tures. I have found that a five-minute con-
versation with a professor is often more
enlightening than an hour lecture. And if
our professors’ goal is to teach, it must also
be fulfilling to them.

I am no critic of this university. I only
want it to be even better for its students, as
it could be. I hope that no professors who
read this think that I am accusing or insult-

students

What is it about the
West? It seems like every
day another friend
announces he or she is
going, whether by train,
bus or car, to the mysteri-
ous land west of the
Rockies. It’s the post—mod-
ern gold rush of the
nineties.

Kelly
Casey

Seattle, Boulder and
Santa Fe have become the
hot spots for so many of
those who belong to the
lost post—college nineties
generation, which seems to
think it will find what it
can’t find here in the great
Holl_Wvood—glorified West.

But why the West? Is it
because it’s so big that
whoever goes there will
become insignificant?
Standing next to a tree
reaching as high as the
Cathedral of Learning or
looking into a big ditch
that extends for hundreds
of football fields would
make anybody feel pretty
damn small.

But for most post—mod—
em pioneers it’s not nature
or the call of the wild that
attracts them. Besides, the
West doesn’t really look all
that different from the East,
especially when one Can
find the same Bob’s Big
Boy placemat in Newark or
Portland.

Maybe it’s more like the
call of “what the hell am I
supposed to do now that I
don’t have any more
exams or papers to keep
me busy? If I just keep
moving no one will be
able to catch up to me and
ask that inevitable question
—— ‘What are you going to
do with your life now that
you’re. out of school?”’

It’s an easy question to
answer when you can just
say “I’m moving out West.”
That seems to be enough
to satiate any imp1orer’s
mind. It’s as if simply going
to that far-away land of big
prairies and big mountains
is really doing something
important —— even if when
you get there all you do is
serve batter-dipped fried
fish to overweight families
of five.‘

One can even avoid the
question altogether by
moving 3,000 miles away
where you know nobody
except an aunt you met
once 12 years ago.

As you're driving West,
passing through St Louis,
Denver, Dubois and one
McDonald's after another;

Lectures

The UHC, in conjunction with the Student Honors
Activity Community sponsors a weekly lecture series
which gives Pitt faculty an opportunity to share some
of their recent work with undergraduates from across
the university. The lectures are held each Friday

University Honors College

What Is the Honors College?

The University Honors College (UHC) was
dedicated in 1987 to meet the special academic and
co—curricula.r needs of the University's most capable
and motivated undergraduates. Building upon the
University Honors Program which began in 1978, the
College provides increased opportunity, incentives, and
recognition for high academic attainment by students.

The UHC is open to undergraduates from
throughout the university. As a College, it brings
students together with human and material resources
which are often retained at the graduate and faculty
levels of a large institution. This is accomplished
through four basic emphases: formal coursework,
special advising, academic community through the
Honors Center (3500 C.L.), and the option to pursue
a unique baccalaureate degree.

University—wide in scope and undergraduate
in focus, the UHC seeks to fuse the scholarly
advantages and resources of a major research
university with the individualized attention, rigor, and

and sauce. Sure, pepper-
oni would complete the
. meal, but use the cheese
rule: if you. are paying,
skip the topping; or bet-
ter yet, get another
friend. The pizza is not
only cheap, it’s good. It
gets my highest rating.

Fries, fries and more
fries: The “O” boasts (in
neon) over 30,000
pounds of fries served
weekly. I’ve never
doubted that fact
because of the size of
the orders Any experi-
enced “O”-er will know
the proper size to order
for any size party.

_ It's easy to_ pick out
the beginners. They're
the ones carrying a tray
full of fries (a large
order) back to the table.
with glassy-eyed looks
on their faces. Under no-
circumstances should an
extra largeorder of fries
ever be ordered. Fries
are ordered at a separate
counter in the “Fries
Express Line.” The fries
come with containers of
ketchup, or you can get
them with gravy, but

~ cheese is the most popu-
lar. In this case, forget
about the cheese rule,
forget about cholesterol
-- viva “O” fries.

Other things: The “O”
is eclectic with its menu.
It has hamburgers, ribs,
shrimp, spaghetti and
meatballs, veal parmi-
giana sandwiches and a
variety of subs. The fish
sandwich is pretty good.
Interested in something
out of the ordinary? Try
a veggie boat —— this
grease-soaked vessel has
an abundance of fried
veggies, all of which
taste alike.

One more important
rule to remember when
ordering the more
bizarre things: you are in
a hot dog.shop, you are
in a hot dog shop, you
are ina hot dog shop.
Good luck to all of you
incoming students, and
especially good eating. ‘

‘the third baseline about an hour or so

before the game and had just put down
my camera equipment, when some guy
the rail and
shoved a Dodger cap under my nose.
“Could you get Tommy Lasorda to sign
this for me?” he whined.

I politely (I think) told him that I,
as a 21-year-old college student shoot-

ing his first major-league game, did
,not feel comfortable going up to
the Dodger bench and asking one of
"the living legends of baseball to sign a

$10 baseball cap.Not only that, but I

" strongly suspect that any such attempt

would probably have gotten me
promptly kicked out of Three Rivers
Stadium. ~

He actually was the first of many
such like—minded people who clustered
near the railing next to the photogra-

A _phers’ box before the game. Kids with-

mitts screaming demands at players
li_ke, “Yo, Eric, sign my ball!” or “Hey,
whoever you are, are you any good?
Sign this!”

, There were grown men with the urge
to yell at every player like he was a
close personal friend. “Hey, -Cal, how’s
it goin’?” or “Darryl, it’s nice to see you

again."

Just in case I thought this was a
once-in-a—lifetime experience (which I
didn't), A few weeks later, when I went
to the opening day of Steeler training
camp, a similar situation occurred.
Fans leaned up against the small fence
that surrounded the practice field
shouting at players to “Come over
here!”

Infact, when Bubby Brister walked‘

over to sign autographs, people surged
up against the fence, nearly crushing
the people up front and almost top-
pling the fence. Brister, alarmed, forced
the fans to back up, which they did, for
a moment.

Those two scenes turned me off from
autographs in a major way. For one,
it was the first time I saw the auto-
graph scene from the signer’s point of
view. I had thought less of athletes
who didn’t sign autographs, but now
I have a great deal of sympathy for

them.

Also, I saw how unattractive and rude
autograph-seekers are. In today's
world, I don’t think it is possible to ask
for a signature politely because if you
did, you wouldn't get it. The mad mobs
of people force the single autograph-

‘\

seeker to either muscle out other peo-
ple or to catch their idol at an unusual
time, like when he-doesn’t want to be
disturbed.

I don’t have a problem with people
getting autographs. In fact, I wouldn't
mind having a baseball signed by Cal
Ripken or Barry Bonds. But what I
don’t understand is why some of these
people are so rude or so desperate to
get a simple signature.

Although many of the people who
are hounded by autograph-seekers
make several million dollars a year,
they deserve a «little sympathy because
crazy fans could probably make life
pretty uncomfortable. I mean, I felt
uncomfortable, and the fans couldn’t
care less about me.

Most of all, I am embarrassed
by the small hordes clawing and yelling
at athletes. Most of the members of
the these mobs seem to care little
about the athletes whose signatures
they want or about other members of
their mob.

Like I said, I love sports and I love
watching great athletes perform in
whatever sport they excel in. But I
may never take another autograph
again.

contact people directly -- either
by telephone or in person.
This place is a huge bureau-

cracy. There are departments

for everything. Don’t be embar-
rassed to bother people. You
are paying a lot of money to be
here, so use this place. Squeeze
it dry.

Once you are informed, pick
a direction. This applies more
to classes than to anything else.
Try to figure out what you
want as quickly as possible.

Getting the classes you want
is a pain in the butt, so give
yourself plenty of opportunities
to fit those classes in. Do not
mess around. If you just play
games because you have no
major yet, you will miss out on
a course you wanted and end
up wasting your time in a use-
less class.

Speaking of useless classes,
there certainly are a lot of
them. But there are also some
great ones. Introduction to
Performance is a gem. It is a
first-level class in drama, but
you don’t have to be a drama
major to register for it. And it
does fill a creative expression
requirement. This is a fun class
and you get to meet a lot of
people. If you do take it, go in
with an open mind and a sense

of humor. You could have
some fun and learn something.

Presidential Rhetoric is anoth-
er interesting class. Everyone I
know who has taken this class
raves about Professor Ted
Windt.

If you / like writing,
Introduction to Journalism or
Creative Writing Could be help-
ful. Even if you are already an
accomplished writer, a class in
the basics will give your work
a more solid foundation.

Tops on the waste side is
Freshman Studies. Just buy the
book (oh yeah and read it) and
you will not miss much.

If you are not an athlete then
sports classes are also a
waste. You do not need a class
to exercise. If you are going to
put in the work to go to col-
lege, you should take advan-
tage of the opportunities to
learn.

One thing that reduces the
chances to learn is a lousy
teacher. Unfortunately though it
is difficult to find out about this
before a class starts. If you do
find yourself in a class with a
teacher whom you think inade-
quate don’t be afraid to move
on to another section of the
same class. It is worth taking
the time to catch up in a class
rather than staying in one you

could come to regret.

Something else you could do
is get involved in extracurricu-
lar activities. The only one I
know about is The Pitt News,
and I think it has been a great
experience for me. These are
things that give you a chance
to do something constructive
and get some practical experi-
ence.

Groups also allow you to

meet people. Many people 1.

come to college from a homo-
geneous environment. Pitt is
anything but homogeneous,
and that is one of its greatest
advantages. Some may not like
it, but the real world is a multi-
cultural place. You might as
well learn to live with it.

It is tough to say which
groups are good to join. That is
for each individual to decide.
Students often dictate the direc-
tion a group takes. Because of
this there are not as many glar-
ingly bad groups as there are
classes. As I said before, this is
where you have to decide on
your own what you want and
then go out and find it.

However, remember there
are a lot of things you can get
out of Pitt. As a long-time stu-
dent at this university told me,
“Use this place.”

Faith

ly stating what should be obvi-
ous — that students have a right
to these and professors have a
responsibility to encourage our
access to them.

I place these thoughts in the
orientation issue because I hope
that they are being read by
many incoming students who
will be members of the universi-

ty community for some years.
And I hope that they remember
that students have rights and
professors have responsibilities
that don’t stop when class
adjourns. These include creating
an environment in which we
can readily learn from them.
That’s how professors gain
respect.. I hope you make them
earn it.

problem. You shower, eat break-
fast, put on your best outﬁt and
give your teeth a tremendous
brushing. You arrive to class 20
minutes early to once again go
over what you read last night

Sooner or later you slip, and
believe me, it does not take long
The alarm goes off and you hit that
button once. It is all over. You will
now arrive at class having skipped
breakfast, unshowered, in sweats
and with your teeth given the
onoe-over.

You have now developed into a
full—fledged snoozeaholic. The
urgency of this disease depends
upon how many times you hit the
snooze button before getting up. If
your snoozing gets so bad that you
miss class, you have transcended
snoozeaholism. You now have
REMitus. This is much worse, and
you really need help.

I have developed several ways

to avoid snoozeaholism. The first is
to never go to. bed There are now
times when I can stay awake for
weeks on end. This is great for
two reasons: 1) I do not have to
worry about missing class and 2) it
makes an all-nighter during ﬁnals
week simple.

My second technique is to have
my roommate set the television to
Good Moming, America .and put it
right in my face. If Bryant Gumbel
cannot get me out of bed then
Wﬂlard Scott certainly can.

Finally I bought a clock-radio
with a special alarm system that
plays only Barry Manilow music 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
The only problem is thatl am now
constantly whistling “Copacabana.”

These are just a few ways to
minimize the damage. There are
more. It does not take much to
defeat snoozeaholism. The proper
attitude is all you need to solve
your and the world’s problems. 9

can only provide us with a
reasonably secure campus.

Given the fact that the
Department of Public Safety is
not at its best and that
Oakland is not the safest com-
munity in Pittsburgh, students
should think before putting
themselves in dangerous situa-
tions, thus limiting the
chances that a police officer
will not be available when
needed.

In the meantime, Student

Government Board will con-
tinue to represent student
security concerns to the uni-
versity administration, which
has been receptive and
responsive. Therefore, I am
confident that campus security
will be continually improved
upon so that we may go on
being college students without
the fear of crime accompany-
ing us to our classrooms, resi-
dences or extracurricular
activities. Perhaps in the not-
too-distant future, Pitt will set
the safety standards which
other institutions aspire to
emulate.

Call it Solo
Suicide for
Mr. Daltrey

Roger Daltrey
Rocks in the Head '-
Atlantic Records

Roger Daltrey’ has an
identification problem.

-It’s not that rock fans
cannot recognize the
blonde, raging-aging
front man of The Who
— that’s obvious. It’s
that they can. ‘But
because such glaring
recognition exists,
Daltrey is le-ft out to die
in any artistic endeav-
ors that aren’t affiliated

with the _‘ names
Townsend, Entswistle,
and Moon. That

inclu_des his numerous
forays as a solo artist.

Call it solo suicide.

It’s the same disease
that has plagued the
likes of Paul
McCartney, Mick
Jagger, Robert Plant,
and to a lesser extent,
Roger Waters: monster,
legendary success in a
rock group"... followed
by (at best) lukewarm
success in various for-
ays into the solo artist
world.

Despite the fact that
some of the solo work
done by this quartet
(notably Waters) has
bordered on superb, it
will never be perceived
by rock .fans as classic
—— because it can never
top the Mt. Rushmore’s
of Rock known as The
Beatles, The Rolling
Stones, Led Zeppelin,
and Pink Floyd.

With this in mind,

g why would any one of

these multi-millionaires
— this time Daltrey _———
dare to expose their
pride and reputation
for a plateful of apathy

. and a side dish of
disappointment.

Blame it on rocks in
the head  sort of.

Daltrey has been bit-
ten by the solo bug’
again, this time in his
latest Who-less effort
called Rocles in the
Head. While the above-

~ mentioned formula of

failure is nothing more
than a formality, it does
nothing to take away
from the palatable
effort that laces the 47-
plus minutes of Roger-
Rock.

Heading the list of
tunes to be “in tune
with” is “Days of Light”,

_ a sprightly jumping jig

that has the word
“cookin’ “ saturated
throughout its nearly
four-minute running
time. Opening with a
crisp, finger-snapping
“do da—dooot” chorus
background that begs
repeating several times

Groupthink:

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

The plot is jumbled like a
lotto ball and ﬁlled with incon-
sistencies that leave the viewer
utterly confused -— if not feeling

stupid — but somehow writer 2*

and director Brian De Palma has
done it.

Exactly what he has done is as
mixedup as the film itself.
Critics have fawned over Raising
Cain for exactly the same rea-
son that many viewers -were left
feeling indifferent. The story is
so screwy that anything can
happen (and often does), and
while the film possesses a heap
of thrilling scenes that momen-
tarily grasp you, after the trauma
has passed, you're left asking
yourself a whole new set of

questions as to what is really_

happening.

But the praise De Palma has
received has come from the
director's seeming lack of inter-
est in forming a tidy summary.
There's more of an emphasis on
the things that have made his
past efforts so profound: sheer,
thrilling, black, cinematic excite-

kidnapping a child and intro-
ducing Carter’s dominant and
lethal alter ego, Cain. Apparent
in the film’s first five minutes or
so is the director’s intense use of
the camera to emphasize, but
never stabilize, a strong, thrilling
scene.

Carter rapidly disintegrates, as
he is left humiliated, thanks to
the mother's lack of interest of
sending her kid off to a “vision-
ary” child—psychology clinic. He
begins to sneeze and shake mid
even KOs her with some chemi-
cals, but the horror is clearly
marked by a closeup shot of
Lithgow that alerts the impend-
ing doom. It’s classic Hitchcock
stuff, something De Palma has
always been an open admirer
of, and while Alfred took more
time out to build the drama, De
Palma — who has adhered to
that style before (Body Double)
— is more anxious to deliver
the goods this time around,
lending an immediate jolt to the
screen, then moving on to
explore again.

the feeling you get when you

Book Reviews  

For The Love Of The
Game

Michael Shaara
Carrol and Graf

In For the Love of the Game,
fictitious pitcher Billy Chapel
could throw just about any
pitch except the knuckle ball.

A knuckle ball is a perfect
analogy for the style in which
Pulitzer Prize—winning author
Michael Shaara wrote this tale
about a future Hall-of-Fame
pitcher at the end of his
career. The story is erratic,
confusing, all over the place

I and frustrating. Also, as with

any well-thrown knuckle ball,
it is effective more often than
it isn’t.

The story follows Chapel’s

I train of thought through the

day of his last outing of the
season. This leads to a chop-
py style as the reader
bounces back’ and forth
between the current action
and Chapel’s memories and
daydreams.

The book is short, but it is
not an easy read. It does get
confusing, and patience on
the part of the reader is a
key. Still, the book is worth
the timeand effort.

One reason is explained by
the title, For the Love of the
Game. This is a book tailor-
made for baseball fans with a
soft spot for the good guys
who seem to play the game
forever and never really grow
up.
Another reason is the char-
acter of Billy Chapel. Shaara
manages to make him seem
like a total human being. He
is the kid who never had to
grow up because he was born
with an amazing ability to
throw a baseball.

Chapel is supremely confi-
dent on the mound, simple
off of it. He played 17 years
for one team. His contracts
were gentleman’s agreements
sealed by a handshake with
the team owner. In a time of
spoiled millionaires holding
out for every dollar they can

get, Chapel is the ideal of a
great player who just wants
to play.

Off the field he is Billy boy.
He depended on his parents
until they died. He is honest
and maybe a bit flaky. He
and girlfriend Carol have a
simple relationship and have
fun together with no respon-
sibility.

Suddenly reality knocks
Chapel’s simple world on its

ear. A sports reporter tells

him he is being traded and
wants to know if Chapel will
go or retire. Just as he begins
to realize that this may be his
sign that it is time to give up
the game, Carol calls. She
says she has decided to go
home and probably marry a
wealthy older man who will
take care of her. She tells
Chapel that he doesn’t need
her, and he doesn’t know
how to respond.

Not knowing what to do,
Chapel does the one thing he
can do: he goes out and

‘pitches, this time for the last"

time. This is where the book
picks up as the story bounces
back and forth between
Chapel’s last game and his
memories. The game
becomes the climax and turn-
ing point of his life.

Accepting the premise of
following Chapel’s train of
thought, the story"is present-
edmealistically. Events aren’t
presented in an organized
manner — everything is jum-
bled together just as it it were
a human mind trying to figure
out the future while living in
the present.

The development of the
other characters adds realism.
Shaara doesn’t try to show
how they really are, he just
gives Chapel’s picture of
them at that moment of his
life.

A wonderful character like
Billy Chapel is reason enough
to read this book. For base-

.3.a%.t?1992 -

ball fans, this book is a must— ;

read — simply for the love of
the game.

Shampoo Planet
Douglas Coupland
Pocket Books

One of the most interesting books I have read
in the last two years was Generation X by
Douglas Coupland. A classic in many ways, it
caught my eye because it created a flurry of new
words to describe things in everyday late-’80s,
early—’90s life. For example, “Mcjob” — tempo-
rary, dead—end employment, like working at a
fast-food place.

Coupland has come out with a new book with
the artistic title Shampoo Planet. This book has
the initial difficulty of matching its predecessor.
Could Coupland have anything else to say to the
generation that just missed the sixties?

Not really, unfortunately. There are still some
great new definitions, like the “McDead,” used to
describe people today absorbed in sixties cul-
ture. “The sixties are like a theme park to them,”
Tyler Johnson, the protagonist in Shampoo
Planet, said. “They_ wear the costume, buy their
ticket, and they have the experience. Their hair
may be long, but it smells great.”

Tyler is a “twenty-year—oId MTV child” who
was raised in a commune and now lives in a
“small northwest city.” The city is crippled with a

1, ,..

.k ‘.

collapsed nuclear industry and has a dying
megamall. Tyler dreams about being an execu-
tive at a company his mother once firebombed
and has nightmares about being poor.
' The book begins with Tyler just back from a
trip to Europe. What happens after that is kind
of hard to follow simply because nothing really
happens. Eventually he finds hirnself on the way
to L.A. with the Ice Queen of Europe, Stephanie,
but it is hard to figure out why — maybe some
sort of bizarre need to be with somebody rich or
rich-looking. 1

If this book has a theme or moral, it escapes
me. And if Tyler has a personality, it also
escapes me. Each chapter ends with some stupid
summation. An example; Tyler is taking a picture
of his mother, and eventually he convinces her
to pick up a jack-o’—lantern and hoist it on her
shoulder. Tyler asks her to pretend the pumpkin
is the one person she fears the most. Tyler snaps
a picture, “a portrait of Jasmine, facing the world
as she does at this point in her life, frightened by
a monster entirely of her own carving” — retch.

Perhaps I'm just not hip enough to follow this
book. It wasn’t unpleasant to read, except for

those chapter endings, but it was confusing.

Unless you like pretentious novels.

EPMD gets
back in
the funk

business

EPMD
Business Never Personal .
Def Jam Recordings

Two albums later, EPMD is
back with the bomb. After 1988’s
impressive debut Strictly Business,
Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith
released two inconsistent
(Unﬁnished Business and Business
As Usual) but at times bumpin’
records that entrenched EPMD as
a legitimate rap act but failed to
move the group up the elite rung
of hip hop. All that has changed
now, thanks to tireless work, a
bevy of posse members and pos-
sibly the summer’s finest release.

Business Never Personal is
designed meticulously for the
urban streets, droppin’ mega—bass
for the Jeeps and lyrics that keep
ya holdin’ your jewels. The Long
Island natives let you know it,
too, claiming to be the true pur-
veyors of underground funk. And
while others may make similar
claims, EPMD has managed to
stay true to the street while
appealing to a broader audience.
Each of the three previous efforts
went gold in sales, and there's no
reason why this one shouldn’t as
well because it’_s all that

Like the use of the word in

each of the group’s album titles,
EPMD is all about business. Rollin’

with the posse called The Hit

Squad (which EPMD oversees
and helps produce and promote),

as this summer’s ﬂavor.

First Das Efx dropped some
crazy lyrics over a lot of Big
Daddy Kane beats and came out
with a record that was so Dead
Serious that it recently topped the
R&B charts.“ Like 7799 Source said,
it’s got the jam that even your old

All of them appear on Business

(Das Efx) team up with the

Microphone Doctors for the hard— .

core cut “Comin’ Atcha,” which
samples Cypress Hill (the year’s
most sampled LP) and D-Nice in
the rugged chorus and even bites
CH’s patented quick horn frag-_

merits and bass track from “How I
Could Just Kill A Man” for one of
the summer’s hottest tracks. Both
duos flow freely, and it seems that
EPMD may have been inﬂuenoed
by Das’s hyper-popular-culture
droppin’ lyrics as they speed up
their delivery and drop as many
references to the entertainment
industry as a pigeon drops dung.
Using silly but in—vogue styles like
“nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
like Rocky” and “so, help me
Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda,”
EPMD sprays the vinyl with the

new remote-control tongue that"

pitched organ that weaves in and
out of the chorus. The track
belongs to Redman who gets rek
on the mic in a mad freestyle
way. “It’s Going Down” from the
juice soundtrack appears toward
the album’s end and is a good
indicator of the sound that EPMD
throws down. As hard and mud-
dled as it is dense and machine-
like, the sound is encompassing,
swamping your ears with deep
grooves and plenty of thump. On
the mic, the E—double returns with
his slippery, sloppy and funky
tongue while the MD returns
“chillin’ hard with a P on his
chest.”

“Boondox” blasts the album off
with a near “Bomb Squad” feel,
shredding with hyper energy and
a tinny snare drum kick that
moves the track. “Chill” is a
densely produced cut with a host

of background beats, a deep,
bouncy bass organ and a domi-
nant chorus that’s powered by a
Rakim territorial sample from “My
Melody." Also used on the cut is
something that EPMD flowers
throughout the tape — se1f-reflex-
ive sampling. Using the chorus
from “You Got’s To Chill” (from
Strictly Business) to lend to the cut
only makes you wonder how
important these guys really think
they are. The record is definitely
listener- and particularly sampler-
friendly as all the beats are identi-
fiable to the ear and many are
straight outta the EPMD archives.

“Crossover,” and its bite of the
“Strictly Business” guitar riff, and

Continued from page 1

with a potent blow from Japan’s Zeni
Geva and the upcoming Jesus Lizard/Tar
show.

With Magic Manny in the pulpit, the
growing and improving legion of local

' groups was able to peddle its wares on

a consistent basis as the ‘Burgh stamped
its gradually darkening mark on the
independent music circuit. The value
barometer blew sky-high as kids saw
three and four bands for a measly sum
and little girls swooned as their favorite
‘local rock boys recorded 7” and 12"
vinyl patties. The fall is destined to be
written with a ‘different flavor since
we’ve seen the extinction of decent and
soon—to-be legendary acts. Between
somewhat vital venues shutting their
doors to live shows and others simply
black—balling certain promoters,
Pittsburgh’s cognoscenti may stag-
nate momentarily.

As things change within the local
scene, things seem to remain the
same. The incestuous following o
fanatics rarely rears its giant ticket—count-
ing head, this summer’s highly anticipat-
ed Pavement show being an exception.
And things continue to turn nearly
bizarre and insignificantly disastrous,
like a recent Speaking Canaries show at
(the quickly forgotten) Nick’s Fat City
where guitarist Damon Che dropped his
drawers and flagged the soundman. But
as the scene moves from venue to

, venue at random, the quality of the

bands seems to be growing although an
overall sound can’t be pigeonholed.

For better or for worse,‘ local Indie
rockers still seem to have to borrow
their sounds from other cities, leaving
Pittsburgh with the unenviable stigma

THE PITT NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 31, 1992

  
 
 
 
   
   

 

that we lack a signature sound. But all of
this isn’t bad — the recent uprising of
quality local bands, responding to all
genres of Indy rawk, has led this still-
dominated labor city into a union with
heavyweights in Indie land. ‘

All of this still remains brazenly z'n.te1l1'—
gentsia to outsiders, but the R.S.V.P.
deadline remains infinite and the party
may be just beginning for this longtime
invitation—only scene. The following is a
brief and often artfully crafted overview
of some of_ Pittsburghers’ favorite party
favors.

C

Blunderbuss is the hard. Pittsburgh’s
true power trio provides an encompass-
ing sound that hits harder than anything
George Foreman can throw. First time I
saw ‘em was at the Birmingham Lofts
opening for Cop Shoot

were they fat. Dense
as Nottingham with just the bursts 0
energy to,nod your head in agreement
with what they were slinging.

For a trio (Ben on guitar, Bill on the
kits and Jim on the bass), the group has
an incredibly loud sound, almost as if
Wharton Tiers took ‘em over to his infa-
mous studio and just cranked it. The-trio
members are relative newcomers to the
scene who scored their first single on
Manny’s Pop Bus label. The result was a
more metallic drive (almost unavoidably
like early Helmet) than the spew they’re
churning out now. “Flatfoot” was and
still is the jam, while “Linedrive to Your

Rush...

Forehead” emphasized the gurgled
vocals and ringing guitar that propelled
the heavy sound. -

Their second single has just landed in
the Peas Kor stable, and brother it’s all
that. “Bed Rider” has so much drop to it
you’d think you’d fallen off the
Cathedral. “Glace Glare” has a menacing
attack drum, some searing riffs and a
throb—a—bob bass that rings in your head
all day if’ you have your Walkman set
right. The A—side, “Lowlands,” is the
intellectual groove, slowed-down, grind
that even dabbles in melodies for
stretches then releases the boom. With
the mood switching to more noise and
less crunch, Blunderbuss seems to be
sticking to the East Coast sound and
moving away from the scattered metal
head thang. Yeah, put your prison prints
on and sag your jeans, the Buss is
boomin’.

—Brian Berger

Six years and still loud and
strong, the Bone has been pushin’ it
out through the clubs and airwaves.
Only recently has it ventured out of the
local scene. Trips to the Penguin Pub in
Youngstown and the deconstruct
of

wider audience. Mike Shanley —— bassist,

East India and Get Hip have been under

So far it’s been do—it-themselves shoe-
string with the band’s label, Igor.

Lila Shaara’s (guitar and lead vocals)
work has feminist sensibilities coupled
with a healthy dose of cynicism of USA

way a female ought to paint a face or
strap on a bra. For example, the super

kitch comedy piece “Barbie Likes To.

The Bone’s latest single “Sludge

admits its sensibilities are more akin to
Neil Young. And the band’s most recent
material, only to be heard live, is an
attempt to pastiche D. Boon and Mike
Watt with simple three—part progression
and the Bone’s trademark mercurial
brevity.

Barb Madaus is the group’s tried—and—
true drummer. And Bart Wise, who Mike
considers backbone and catalyst, rounds
out the group on lead guitar.

pushes his orange basket past
the islands of Slim Jims and Hi-
C towers, weaving around
mountains of Smucker’s and
Maalox. He arrives at the check-
out and spastically wails bundles of hair
schlop in the same manner that has
earned him the observation as the
busiest drummer in town. Phar Mor Girl
stares at his foamed physique and Chain-
spgoking mug and asks, “Cash or charge,
m'a’am?” Che turns around, crouches and
systematically wipes the lather from his

their up—caliber “expansion-
ist rock.” The sound is fierce
— pushing and wailing like
a woman in labor. And as an
image—supporter, button-
down-collared shirts are the essential
uniforms.

With the “Lucky Father Brown” EP
released in the spring, the Don played
to exuberant crowds and gained the
kind of popularity and demand that is
rarely seen in this town. A second two-
songer was released a few weeks ago
(both recorded at the studio of the year,
Sound Seven) and has gotten much of
the same reception: sooper. It is perhaps
like a good meat: tough, bloody and
loud. Dense and tight, the Don seems to
have led people to believe that this
sound is homegrown, but to Che’s biting
disdain. “We’re new in Pittsburgh
because everyone here is a fool.” Join
the other mediocrities at the Oakland
Beehive on Sept. 2 to see these button-
down—clad (Don Caballero) and clean-
shaven boys when they open for Tar

back-to-school season.

    
  
  
   
  

Recorded at Soun
Seven Studios, a few copies of the demo
have been ﬂoatin’ around all summer.
Songs like “Foot” and “Excellent Poker
Player” thump, mash and crush, but Che
explains it more poetically: “It’s about
animal_kharma — belief and disbelief in
animal kharma.”

Damon appears to be one ofthe
busiest guitarists as well, changing and
rearranging chords, between long bouts
of tuningbetween songs.

   
  
 
 

Surprisingly,
this is Karl’s first time manhandling his
instrument, but I doubt anyone’s noticed
since Mr. Metronome comfortably
thunks at the bass. And Noah’s high-end
frenzy spills over like a good mess of
mangled metal. Sounds like that, uh,
other three-piece band in town? While
the Canaries have vocals, something that
Che’s “other” band lacks, there are other
subtle differences between the bands.

“It’s like two chickens in a barnyard,”
Che explained. “They’re both totally dif-
ferent but they’re both the same.” (To
which I say, “Don’t throw stones at
black kettles”)

As he sees it, the Canaries are more
mellow, an “opera-glass mentality” of
chair sitters, while Don Caballero is a
beer, “Let’s go,” stage-kneeling attitude.

And this summer, Pittsburgh-style
hordes (20-25 fools) slobbered over

Sometimes temperamental with
sound men, Che recently showed his
fine wares in Nick’s Supposed Rock City
to a humored audience and a feisty
sound hack. Bein’ too lahd, ya see, the
L/)1lks at Nick’s Guitar Coven and Elvis
Jailhouse City demanded lower volume
and eventually had the Speaking
Canaries’ equipment turned the—hell—off
within minutes of the set. Now the men-
tality of Fat Chitty aside, this action gives
one artaste of The Speaking Canaries’
sound: loud and seemingly defiant. This
virtual Pgh. Supergroup consists of Che

for the residual hangovers of love, hate
and fear. They are the only things that
define your rusted mortal coil. Admit it:
You felt so much more alive sippin’ the
aqua vitae, right? Well sit up and quit
mumbling. You’ve got a friend. Yes,
even nicer than Chuck Woolery. His
name is Karl, and unless you are in the
ﬁnal stages of decomposition he’ll make
you laugh, weep and hug strangers on
the bus.

Karl Hendricks — poet, musician,
Snapple drinker — wants to beyour
friend. His music, shimmering with
experience, has been where you have
been. You hear the lyrics. Your eyes
sting, well up, and you wonder how he
knew that about you. Days later you lis-
ten again and feel the same way; creepy,
sad, but it feels so good.

At the wheel of the gasshog that is the
Karl Hendricks Trio, Kar1’s guitar is less
spastic on the LP Buicle Elektra than on
his numerous earlier forays, like the

tapes jolly Doom, Where the Dogs Run’

Free (W/IDRF), his Sludgehammer phase
and the IHate 7791;; Paﬂy 7”.

Unlike Karl’s‘other trio, the spine is a
little stiffer with T. Hoffman on skins and
T. Parker on bass. While Sludgehammer

ria tempered by moody, jangly restraint
onto your rock receptors. The combina-
tion mirrors Karl’s lyrics for a tempera-
mental almost theatrical presentation of
whatever the man is singin’ about.

For instance, Buick Eleletrais opening
cut “Dead Flowers” is a simple scenario:
lonely guy waiting up for his old lady.
He waits patiently, longingly as Karl’s
axe lays the nervous heartbeat under
the litanous “Our love smells like dead
ﬂowers/as I lie in bed and count the
hours/waiting for you.” As the fella’s
patience wears thin (“I can wait for 15
more minutes”), the heartbeat picks up
faster and faster and repetition feeds
back into frustration. Just as soon as
Karl is expected to explode in a cacoph-
onous jealous coronary, the heartbeat
gives out and loverboy gives in (“All
right I’ll wait forever). The overall after-
glow of this feels something like an
interrupted orgasm: you're exhausted,
sweaty and unsatisfied but not unwilling
to try again.

Karl does go on for 11 more songs, all
thoroughly soaked in primary colors
with equal potential for involvement;
from the soaring love discovery on “You
Painted My Heart” (from the WTDRF

Daltrey

_ Continued from page 4

The “maturation” idea is
repeated deftly in
“Everything a Heart Could
Ever Want (Willow)”, an ode
from a father to his ever-
growing yet ever—delightful
daughter, Willow. A sweet
line of shoe—on-the—other—
foot starts the festivities
(“She comes home late/ And
l’ve waited long/ Then she
sings me lines/' From the
songs I used to sing — when I
was young”), which conclude

nwith Daltry’s helpless admi-

ready to leave the nest. lt’s
serves as the best song of the
lot, as well asa subliminal
reminder to remember your
parents  because they miss
you.

Overall, the double—help—
ing of social awareness —-
albeit in a bit superficial way
— comes of as genuine and
believable concern "on
Daltry’s part  concern for
tomorrow.

To say that about an artist
who once screamed “Hope I
die before I get old” is a
humorous and refreshing
reminder of positive aspects
of the dreaded “M”-word
(whisper maturity) on former
rebels in their 1ate—40’s.

While the optimistic tone
of another day doesn’t shine
its glowing beam on every
song —— like the tolerable yet
cliche’-ridden ditty’s “Love
is”, “Mirror Mirror”, and
“Before My Time is Up”-—-
the have’s outweight.the
have-not’s, providing rock
fans with Daltry’s strongest
‘solo album to date.

Although that isn't exactly
saying much, it’s a start. And
for a member of the no—win
situation club, that about the
best that Roger Daltrey can
hope for. ‘

tape) to the self-flagellating apologetics
on “Stupidhead” (if this doesn’t make ,
you cry you belong in prison) to the 
reanimated “She Was Hot” (more than a f _
Stones cover — this is all Karll).

Buicle Ele/etra is a sad record, not in a ‘
miserable, stifling Joy Division kindal ﬂzg,-332 "
way but in a sparking, enervating joie de 1 '
z/ivre kinda way. If you get Karl going,
he’ll tell you that he thinks that music,
including indie rock, for many people is ;
an empty exercise like watching TV. ,
Devoid of emotion, listeners are devoid
of empathy, collecting records like foot
fungus and picking at it when they’re
bored. Well Karl said he wants people to
snap out of it. “The only real things are
love, hate and fear,” he said, and he
makes tunes that prove it.

“If you think this record is sad, wait ,,,..  ~
until you hear the 10-inch.” Indeed, the Q «  H
Trio has lotsa wax coming out this year, 1  ' ’
including the 8-song 10-inch Some Girls
Li/ee Cigarettes and another 7-inch this
fall plus another LP and possibly a CD
next year. ‘

Meanwhile, don’t just consume Karl. It
doesn’t work that way. Go slow. Wake
up. Buy someone ﬂowers. Listen. Weep.

E Think fast: When a band is described

a as jangly, what comes to mind? The

Beatles? REM? College radio bands that
sound nice, but don’t have a single origi-
nal idea?

Guitarist Rob Rayshich looks at it dif-
fferently: “When I think of jangly, I think
of too much coffee"

Rob, along with bassist/singer Dave
Schlosser. and drummer Barry Kramer,
play in the local

 

g and Loveswamp. The
trio combines catchy melodies with the

A effects of a little too much caffeine and

' comes up with a sound that can be jar-
ring or pretty, but always memorable. —
The band has been together for three

years and it recently released Amole, a-

seven—song cassette on the Igor label.
Loveswamp is hard to categorize, but

_ the term “bent psychedelic pop” seems

to be appropriate. “I can’t seem to get
away from that,” Rayshich said. “That

A - seems to be a big part of my personality:

long, loping things. [The band] once
agreed that the only things the three of
us all liked were Neil Young, Devoand
Motorhead. I think that would roughly
describe our sound.” Well, in a twisted
sort of way, it does.

Lyrically, Rayshich can get pretty surre-
al, probably influenced in part by Tom
Waits or Captain Beefheart. His job in a
bookstore, he said, often provides inspi-
ration as well. “Being in retail is really
ripe. You see a wide variety of people

’ come through the doors. Basically every

third person who comes through the

‘ door is really crazy. Or that’s my take on

  
 
  

Thackeray Hall or at 204 Brac

them”,

Though Rayshich does a lot of the
singing, most of the songs come from
group compositions. “When we jam,
Dave always tends to start us off with a
Joy Division/Birthday Party nasty riff; I;
do something funky, and Barry winds up 
making sense out of all of that, usuallyi
with some sort of weird jung1e—y rhythm. 
You get three different parts going}

madly and inconsistently, but 
they sort of work their way
out.” A
This could result in
something like
“Yugoslavia,” a long, trancelike piece
built largely aroundtwo chords, or
Schlosser’s “Glass Monkey,” from Amole,

“where the band sounds, roughly, like

Bauhaus doing its version of Beefheart.
Some of the songs go on for a while,
and some sound as if they were inspired

-by the Minutemen and are over before

you can blink.

This fall Loveswamp plans to record
again, at home rather than in the studio.
“Sometimes we overwork the fact that
there are three of us, and we try to fill
the gaps,” Rayshich said, “like there
should be another guitar player or a key-
board player. We’re going to do a tape
that’s either four track or eight track and
try to get more of a live sound, overdub—
bing if anything, a second guitar.”

7799 Rest oft/9e Best

Hurl . .
Indie rock goes to the suburbs, and Mr. Blandings builds his dream house

from the sticky and rugged pop tones of Jawbox and the hushed nuances of
Slint. Add in some Bitch Magnet riffs and even some Codeine fuzz and you

got one Hurl of a band — North Hills natives with obvious inﬂuences from A

the above. The soundis definitively noticeable yet intricately (at times) dis-
cernable from all~out rip-off status. The group has just released its first single
on Pop Bus. “Clutch” is the most ambitious and innovative on the 7", while
"12-Foot Drop” borrows heavily from Slint’s laid back then jerky movements.
Matt and Mat both sing and play guitar and bass while Dave, who also sings,
hits the skins. Young and talented, Hurl has already made the North Hills hip-
per than the South Hills.

Watershed -

Todd from “Swob told us that Watershed was the best band in Pittsburgh,
and it’s hard to disagree musically. Basically a “Jazz” group, it draws on an
eclectic branch of styles ranging from some outstanding free-form to some
milder rock, fusions with interesting instruments. The ‘Shed released its “Sales
And Service” EP_ on Pop Bus last winter and appears ready to unload some-
thing new soon. The group recently had a lineup change, but the band is led
by Ben Opie’s brilliant saxophone and Erin Snyder’s cello work.

Salt Chunk Mary

Old—school Pittsburgh band which rose from the ashes of “a band that broke
up way before they started to suck,” The Crow Flies. Matt Marcus (producer,
guitarist, guidance counselor) orchestrates this uptempo trio which rocks with
a bit of funk and a lot of feel and a bundle of witty lyrics. Pop Bus released
the group’s “Ornithopeter” EP awhile back, and new things are expected from
Matt, Sharon and Ray. '

T4

Any band that hails from State College is bound to have some difficulty
making things happen in the ‘Burgh, but Pee SU’s T4 has drawn only fond
reviews thanks to its well—crafted debut single on Pop Bus (a busy label.).
“Red Oc-her.” is a truck-stop metal dive with a big bass and searing, oily brakes
and vocals thatare actually heard in the mix. “Pretty. Mouth” is the finer of the
two with its arena-rock drumming and double—guitar lead that churn and burn.
The band includes former member (S?) of Slag, and the back of the single has
some type of mental—ward application to‘ fill out and impress your grandma
with. ~

EPMD

Continued from page 7

.Busta Rhymes during its hype chorus. The tune might be the album’s

highlight, at least the E’s first verse, which is raw and filled with a
stuttered drum track and a jangly, groovy guitar riff. Parrish’s verse
gets deeper, but not before he takes a quick turn at imitating “bul1—
shuck” mc’s with a flawed tongue and corny lyrics. “Play The Next
Man” has the album’s poppiest track with its ringing guitar and accel-
erated vocal speed .

“Can’t Hear Nothin’ but the Music” is a slurpy funk track that steals
from Curtis Mayfield ), Kool And The Gang’s “Jungle Boogie” and the
much—used jingle bells from Eric B.’s “Microphone Fiend” combined
with a powerful chorus “Ya hear nothin’ but the music I’m slippin’,”
while “Nobody’s Safe Chump” is a hard chumpy with the E’s messy
tongue all over the track.

EPMD is back and bustin’ hard rights with pure summer satisfac-
tion from the underground. Yea, nod your head to this, ‘cause Brick
and Parrish are makin’ dollars again and crackin’ necks along the
way — business stylin’. '

Another musical  
massacre from
Eric B. and
Rakim

Eric B. and Rakim
Don ’t Sweat the Technique
M C A R e c 0 r d s

Getting respect and becoming
successful is one thing, but few
artists in the rap world have
reached the levels of consisten-
cy or longevity that Eric B. and
Rakim have. Their fourth
album, Don’t Sweat the
Technique, is solid from top to
bottom, featuring the same fla-
vorful jazz sound they kicked
on 1990’s Let the Rhythm Hit

Even with the flooded market
of new sounds this summer,
Eric B. and the R demand
attention. They hit with 12 cuts
and many of them are classic.
The beats are fat throughout,
and Rakim displays his trade-
mark magical flow at a number

of tempos.
The majority of tracks feature
live instruments: stand—up

acoustic bass, piano and
organs, saxophone and horns
and of course more than
enough drums.

The album kicks off with one
of the two previously released
cuts, the midtempo groove
‘‘\What’s on Your Mind” from
House Party 11. After that things
heat up quickly as the R drops
science on “Teach the
Children.” Subtle piano and
light drumbeats provide a gen-
tle contrast to »Rakim’s baritone
delivery.

“They wanna go to war/
more wars to come/ but most
of us ﬁght more wars than one/
 the hole in the ozone layer’s
out of control/ but they wanna
fight for more oil and gold/
unemployed I got laid off/ the
streets is the last resort to get
paid off.” Rakim plays the
street version of Robin Hood to
rescue the poor, while the cho-
rus tells us to remember the
children and ’ save the
nation.“Pass the Hand

approach

Grenade” hits harder than
Riddick Bowe as Ra attacks the
beat in familiar style over layers
of bassy horns and funky gui-
tar.

The mind—numbing knowl-
edge of “Casualties of War”
provides the album’s finest
moment. Rakim delivers sci-
ence, ripping George Bush

again and again with a deep-

rumbling backdrop and funky
sax loop.

The graphic images of com-
bat and “kill—or—be—killed kind
of attack” leave nothing to the
imagination as Rakim rants
about government schemes,
doubt, innocent families and
coffins.

“Casualties of war/ as I
the barricade/
where’s the enemy/ who do I
invade  ‘cause I got a family
that waits for my return/ to get
back home is my main con-
cern/ I’m a get back to New
York in one piece/ but I’m
buried in sand that’s as hot as
the city streets/ sky lights up
like fireworks blind me/ bullets

‘Nam I might not make it
back/ missile hits the area/

my war dreams/ heat up the

ers and I just caught ya/
addicted to murder/ send
more body bags/ they can’t
identify ‘em leave the name
tags/ I get a rush when I see
blood/ dead bodies on the
floor/ casualties of war!”

“Rest Assured” leaves you
shaken with the deepest
bass groove of the year, cer-
tain to vibrate systems
everywhere. This cut is
stripped down, with soft

j organs and the “O07 is back”

sample highlighting the cho-
rus. “The Punisher” is just
that, hard and heavy with
the R on a furious rampage
—— look out. Cuts like “Relax
with Pep” and “Keep the
Beat” mellow the tone for a
bit, until “Know the Ledge”
from the juice soundtrack
rips it up again.

The title track has been
blowing up _for awhile with
an accented groovin’ jazz
bassline, latin samba—style
backbeat and punchy saxo-
phone fill.

This is the R at his brag-
gadocio best, philosophizing
and flowing smoothly as
only he can. This cut is sort
of a self-tribute to what this
rugged tandem has accom-
plished over the last six
years, daring other emcee’s
to bite the style.

“Let’s trace the hits/ and
check the file/ let’s see who
bit/ to detect the style/ I ﬂip
the script/ so they can’t get
vile/ at least not now/ it’ll
take a while/ I change the
pace to complete the beat/ I
drop bass until MCs get
weak/ for every word they
trace is a scar they keep/
‘cause when I speak/“they
freak ,to sweat the tech-
nique.”

“Kick Along” features
some of the nicest flowing
Rakim does on the album,
with an uptempo, energetic
pace and a soft undertone to
R’s hectic delivery.

We get more sax and
organs to close the album
out. Eric B. and Rakim pro-
vide satisfaction guaranteed,
and if you like hip-hop
artists with a sincere prod-
uct, then Don’t Sweat the
Technique. Just sit back and
appreciate two of the rap
game’s true masters at their
best.

Welcome to Wherever You Are
Atlantic

\X/hat’s it gonna be boys —— flash or funk?

Are ya’ gonna drown in the depths of spaced-
out MTV stardom? Or are ya’ gonna “listen like
thieves” . and return to the smokin’ rock-pop
tunage that made you a hot critical success in
the mid-80’s?

These are the confrontational, mid—career crisis
questions surrounding INXS, the Australian-
based rock staple that has found itself on the
verge of complete sellout status following a
glitzy—weak 1989 release, X, and a mediocre live
album (Live Baby Live) in 1990.

With Welcome to Wherever You Are, the
band’s latest Atlantic release, lead slinker
Michael Hutchence and crew attempt to recreate
the groovin’ vibes that made Listen Lilee Tbieves
both a critical and commercial monster. The ver-
dict? It’s a decent road to recovery, but inconsis-
tent for a mid—30’s group that prides itself on
blazing its own trail  and walking its own
walk.

Call it a black—and—white effort at getting back
to their roots and redefining their place in the
rock-pop work. Or call it a poor-man’s Zoo
Station.

From Questions, the intro single that leads off
Welcome, to Men and Women, the blurred,
sleep—inducing closer, jHutchence and company
perform musical chutes—and-ladders — alternat-
ing fits of pompous passion with moments of
mediocre monotony. Inconsistency by INXS.

Starting with the props, a simple track worth
four minutes of your time is Baby Don’t Cry, a
song that follows the “less is more” theory of
songwriting. Dreamy, uplifting generic images
(“When you’re down and confused/Nothing
seems right) are reborn, thanks to axsmooth

the frightened ones (“Beautiful girl/stay with
me/She wants to go home”). The lonely piano

opening aptly compliments the atmosphere off

the song.

As for the pop radio—friendly tracks, Not
Enougb Time is one of those commercial-friend-
ly singalongs worthy of the props and airplay it
receives. It’s a sweet sensation. Currently climb-
ing the charts and saturating the MTV airways,
Time thrives at both lyrical and musical levels.
Yo—yo bass work makes the sleepy chorus (“Not
enough time  for every kiss/and every tough

.. and all the nights/I wanna be inside you”) all
the more effective. The clincher, though, is a

terrific backing vocals of Deni Hines —— an cnti— .

ty in tune—making that, more often than not,
determines the fly or fail factor of a rock tune.
She’s a perfect compliment I-lutchence’s brood-
ing lead vocals — making it the best tune of the
album.

The bass again rears its groovin’ head in Taste
It, a step—ladder ride that keeps pace with
Morrison wanna—be’s sweet rap—sing, creating
sonic tinge from top to bottom (“A need to

quench/The thirst of many/To justify/and make,

it ready”).

Now for the yawners —— and there are many.
Communication is a silly, upbeat version of
Mediate  only more repetitive (if you can
believe that) and politically suffocating. With
general images of strife and sinister actions
(“There's a war out here/Tl1ere’s a bomb on the
floor”), it’s "a juvenile version of the smart and
slick work found in U2’s Acbtung Baby. To top
it off, the idea of slamming the medium (albeit

just-folks appeal. Accompanying the two
Johns are Kip Ruffel (also of ATS) and
super-beatnik Mike Shanley.

High points of the group’s
ground-floor

recording are “12-
Hour Drive,” a reflective look at
the emotive dynamics of a road trip, and
“Candy All the Time,” a title that has a
parody of the Bow Wow Wow
tune. It's stand—up, straight-
ahead, no-frills rock-and-roll,
john Young said: “You can be
earnest to the point of self—par-
ody. I"think that’s where U2 found
themselves and now they're almost
forced to react deliberately against their
image. I hope people think our music is
honest and sincere but without all the
bombast. There’s no lyrical agenda, just
a bunch of songs about people.” And
they’re a peop1e’s‘people band —
Socialist rock for the lovely masses, the
music Belinsky dreamed of.

-Rob Penman

The founding woman and matriarch of
WPTS (98.5 FM) who hurled its airwaves
into the post-punk X-Husker Du thing
—— Patti Pisula —- heads up this new
group. Patti, a Johnstown native, had
her start here in Pittsburgh as disc-jock-

  COMPANY
3707 Forbes Ave., Oakland

 
 
  
 
 
     

    
  
  
  

ey who, with this above-mentioned
radio station, laid the foundation by initi-
ating discourse between herself and the
core independent recording
labels of the ‘80s.
Accompanying Patti is Andy
Johanson (no relation to Kyle)
on guitar. The resplendent
and delicate vocals ﬂoat above the gui-
tars with Lori Grosick doing it Chrissy
Hynde—Kendra Smith style. Ellen Bass
lays the structure’s foundation with her

bass work. And Al Vish, considered by S

many to be a national treasure, bottoms

skins. '

Having been around barely five
months, the group has an appearance of
a Western Psych structure akin to Mazzy
Star and its earlier incarnation Opal. I
mean, it’s like the Sam Sheppard struc-
ture of the alone and unmoored
American soul that can either roam the
steeped and sparse Titian mountain
range of the Dakotas or scour the
grungiest_backwashed dumpster alley of
a Houston, Tex., ghetto. “Sex” is my fav.
The lyrical voice has an anthropological
distance to its inquiry into the old bibli-
cal move plus slow grinding guitar work
that makes one think about the power
of a libidinous trance and that maybe,
just maybe, our single most primal drive
is governed under the auspices of the

’ of venues. Boscoe and his bunkies

trance.

Some naysayers mistakenly harsh on
their sound calling it plain and simple.
This method of inquiry is disingenuous
and truncated. Like the Dakota
Badlands, sparse, desolate and unfertile,
the band's beauty is paradoxical. Unlike
the current trends within independent

sound, Patti sees her band as distanced

from — not unsimilar to — the pre-

pubescent or the sensitive themes that
carry the current day. Rather it’s a, bit of
that, a smattering the Pretenders way
with a healthy injection of the off-tuned

Kim Gordon—Thurston Moore sensibili-
ties. Good luck, guys.
Your brand of simplicity
can be worn as a badge
of honor.

-Rob Penman

Sitting in the confines of Frank
Boscoe’s living room a few weeks
ago, I witnessed the first “installment”
of a cozy and hospitable music con-
cept. Appropriately titled, Parlor Rock
is a much—needed departure from
smoky caffeineries and smoky bar
rooms and fills the soon—to-be void

plan on once—a-month-or-so gigs
featuring bands, art, reading,
refreshments and chat. OK, so only
a handful of people showed up,
but we all got a program (with a

printed “Parlor Rock Manifesto” explain-

ing the deal  “Parlor Rock means
groups of friends, guests, col-
laborators and co—conspirators
entertaining and performing
in a parlor—type setting  In
parlor rock, the program will
be loosely centered around
music; however, text readings
and parlor tricks and games are
other key elements”), we all got
refreshments (tuna/celery
things, blue booze and other
drink) and we all got a good
seat in the parlor.

The “house” band agreed to
play after the “scheduled” act,
Eggs’ Scaley Andrew, called to
say he had a nasty hangover and
couldn’t come. Oh well. In typical
impromptu form, Wimp Factor 14
agreed to play. T hey’re apt to do
this — be it playing X-mas carols
at a party or playing between sets
at other shows, WF14 seems to be
ready-n-willing to entertain anyone
at anytime.

Bellingham, Wash.’s Crayon said
that WF14 is the group’s new
favorite band. From what I under-
stand, lots of people outside of this
God—forsaken town agree. The
‘Burgh’s audiences have never been
known for exuberance or crowd size,
yet WF14 doesn’t seem to think about
it too much. Actually, the band
doesn’t seem to reflect on the politics
of band-membership, interviews or

attitude (or else they put
up a semi-convincing
front in interviews).

‘‘I don’t want to
do self-promotion,” front-
guy Frank Boscoe said,
“and then let people
down.”

And letting people
down who like them
they’re not doing. With
the departure of guitarist
Rob Washburn in August,
the band will survive,
albeit with a name
change and a shuffle of
players. WF14 has
enjoyed several good
years as an “eclectic pop
band,” a few singles on
both Harriet and Four
Letter Word labels, a two-
week tour with Crayon
and an appearance on
the lovey-dovey One Last
Kiss compilation released
by Spin Art. Formed at
the first CMU Telarama
when the members were
still college folk, the
members plan on contin-
uing their clink-clank-
twang even after their last
show on August 20.

ENTER: The Quiet
Three, actually Four. As it
appears Frank will still be
here, banjo ukelele in
hand, drummer Gary
Miklusek will drag him-
self away from his globe,
cigar box, Xylophone and

’ buckets and handle the
guitar while newly
appointed drummer Greg
Pierce will take over the
drum kit. As for bassist
Kate Glicksberg, well‘, she
said she was goin’ to the
Big Apple now that she’s

guess if the band does
well she’1l stay here
longer. The same
upbeat/pared—dowrr pop
will stay, as will the hum-
ble songwriting of mas-
ter-of—the-heart Boscoe.
As for changes, there will
be more instruments
(more ukeleles?) and the
sound will be looser (“to

be like Sebadoh is
inevitable,” I heard’m
say).

As for their last show
as the WF unit, it seemed
relatively anticlimactic.
Bobbing heads and
swooning hearts (“they
look so cute up there,” I
heard someone mutter)
abounded, but eyes were
dry, while handshakes
were exchanged. I guess
there’s no time to be
wistful when there are
brand—spankin’-new
futures on the horizon. If
you shed a few reading
this, keep in mind that
four singles (or so) will
be available shortly. For
the price of a ham sand-
wich, you can fondly
remember those salad
days thanks to Harriet
Records and the Wimps.

Bands break up, but records remain

Northern Bushmen

Always enigmatic, these
locals appear to have called it
quits for good. Or have they?
They’ve broken up on numer-

_ ous occasions before, and in-

house disputes have always
been part of their rudeboy
appeal. But they also were one
of the first locals to really harp
on the noise movement that
continues to surge across the
country. Dropping a bomb with
their first single in 1990 on‘ the
now-defunct pudgy label
Cubist Productions entitled
Happy Hooleer Worms, the
Bushmen wailed and flailed all.
over the vinyl with anattitude
that was seen but never heard
on the local scene. A
Combining brutal elements of
drums (Noah), scorch guitar
(Pat), a bully bass (Chris) and
some unknown vocals that yell
but never soothe (Mike), the
Bushmen came out breathing
recycled new life with their
anti-spectator stance and ability
to appal (see record insert).
Their debut’ was produced by
Sal Fly/Crow Chunk Matt
Marcus and contained the

head-nodding, blistering breaks
of “Laura” and “Knob.” The 7”
also showed the Bushmen’s

_TH_E PI’I'I' NEWS ORIEN'_I‘A'1'IQN ’I‘S‘SUE,, Monday, A.ugu_st,5_1_,, 1992

intelligent side as they blasted
through quick unstructured
instrumental jabs like
“Camelbacked Whale Driver.”
For awhile the Bushmen were
the talk of the underground
scene as they reportedly landed
a singles deal with New York-
based Circuit Records which
put out 3- gonderful STP single,

Cop  Cop’s first full-’
length‘ '  -..'."‘and various Surgery
singles. Despite Sean

.‘McDonnell’s (Surgery) influ-
ence, the deal fell through as *

Circuit caved in and forever
lives in past glory — which
may be where the Bushmen
have to dwell.

They did leave us with a fine
slab of second vinyl on
Pittsburgh’s second most noto-
rious label, Peas Kor (Karl
I-Iendricks’s creative outlet),
aptly titled Northern Bushmen.
The record is a whirlwind of
dissonant noise that furthers
the band’s salty attitude. The
punkish drive nad chaos still
exists as the band refocuses on
its laughing hyena-like sprin-
kled path. “Raymond Fisher” is
a churnin’ freak show, while

their mark through some past

Kaﬂca Romance
Dissolver

Unlike most of the bands in
this section, Kafka Romance
Dissolver has not broken up
not so much as taken time off
to regenerate. With its name
taken from a phrase used by
Miss Manners, the band special-
izes in fast, simple power pop.
With little use for things like
guitar solos, the group empha-

, .  C.-21

sizes melody and lyrics.

Gary Anderson (vocals, gui-
tar) and man-of-several-bands
Tom Hoffman (drums) have
been with the group since it
was called the Judy Brothers.
With Gary Miklusek on bass,
Kafka released an 11-song tape
last year that recalled California
garage bands from the early
‘80s such as 100 Flowers.

Alan Lewandowski joined last
fall, replacing Miklusek.
Catherine Hardecker also
joined as harmony vocalist ear-
lier this year. During a few of
the group’s performances,
Kafka added a few extra band
members including go—go
dancers and a flute player.

The new lineup of the band
recently recorded five songs.
Included in the batch of songs
is Alan’s great “Bolan’s
Candies,” which starts out
about the candy store at Fifth
and Wood and winds up being
a salute to T. Rex singer Marc
Bolan’s sexuality. Gotta love it.

Alan recently left the band to
move to California. The new

material can be heard on the _~

local college stations, but plans
to release it are up in the air.
Kafka will still be playing
shows, though. Catherine told

its second

of Tadusz on

more cerebral in the tradition

was reported that he was well-

believe can cause depression in
impressionable teens. _

achieved unexpected notoriety
in the days following the morn-

returning home from aerobics,
Mrs. Mary Jo Phebus found her
16-year-old daughter Candy
lying motionless on her bed-

empty can of Redi.Whip in her
pale lifeless hand. Persis Hussy
was on the turntable.

Since then, the Candy Phebus

members of Swob, claiming
that subliminal oboe tracks on
the record contributed to

JCandy’s death.

music. Swob, according to its
attorney Emmanuel Theiner,
‘cannot be comfortably pigeon-
holed into either category.
Theiner plans for the defense
to be built on this trend. In fact
many Swob fans claim that it is
just this resistance to conven-
tion that defines the former
band members as groundbreak-
ing artists.

Unfortunately that is only the
first of many problems facing
the former members of Swob.

Additional lawsuits have been
filed by California PR firm
Negativland and British rappers
K.K. Downing and Rob

Although Persis Hussy was
pulled from store shelves last
month in a little-known adden-

Ice-T made with the Man,

Continued from page 4
thing at the screen in a barrage
of dream and ﬂashback
sequences. The problem, of
course, is that you have no idea
what is real, whether these
things happened today, never or
whenever, or even who is who:

. is it Carter ﬂashing back or is it

Cain?
The answer lies in the ulti-
mate Hollywood tactic: go see it
Y again. In Fairness to the

1 -)Director, who says his intention

was to “unravel a mystery  so
you don’t know which inforrna—
tion is real and which isn’t,” he
seems to have mastered his
film’s vision. I don’t think a
repeat performance in hope of
boosted box—ofﬁce sales was his
intention. .

Instead, he seems only inter-
ested in moving the whole thing
along, dragging whatever under-
standing the viewers take with
them. It isn’t until late in the film
that we learn some of the dark
secrets of Dr. Nix (Carter’s
father) courtesy of Dr.

. 5 Waldheim.

The action is too important to
stoplfor such pertinent details,
so the viewer is informed during

a hyper, up—and-down walk.

involving Waldheim and the two
detectives investigating the mys-
terious disappearance of chil-
dren and the murder of a moth-
er and babysitter (all of which
were the doings of Cain).

As Waldheim answers the.

question, “Who is Dr. Nix?” it is
done on the run, with Waldheim
uncertain of which direction to

I  ,walk. It is this very style that

' makes the film cinematically
exciting and swiftly driven, like
the dream and flashback
sequences that move in and out
of the plot.

Lithgow is particularly effec-
tive in all the roles he plays.
Three are actually shown on
screen and as the rational, yet
helplessly bullied Carter,
Lithgow shines with whimpering
and shyness that parallel another
of his characters, the 7—and-one-
ha1f—year-oldjosh, who emerges
to talk alone with Dr. Waldheim.

Dressed in black leather,
smoking and sporting shades, it
is apparent from our first intro-
duction that Cain is not to be
messed with. Popping in and
out, creating peril and taking
children with him, Lithgow’s
abrasive twist is perfect. lt’s even
the role he said he liked most,
preferring this cynical, yet seri-
ous demeanor to the more neu-
tral Carter. Even as the
Norwegian—born Dr. Nix, a soul-
less foreigner who experiments
on little kids, Lithgow is com-
manding, using his Norwegian

3 tongue and self-conscious man-

nerisms with ease.

While Lithgow flows freely
from character to character, his
(Carter’s) wife Jenny (Lolita
Davidovich) seems looser. Her
character eagerly jumps into an
old relationship with Jack
(Steven Bauer—Manny from
Scarface) and even has no scru-
ples about where they do it (in
the adjacent woods to the

if crowded and recently hostile
""»., playground where all the plot’s

amischievous acts occur).

She seems only a bit con-
cerned with Carter's recent
behavior, being more worried
about their child and the domi-
nating affection Carter has dis-
played lately. In no way is she

ever portrayed as some type of ,

hysterical mother/wife barome-
ter who is tremendously affected
by the recent discovery that her
husband is schizo and has been
killing and robbing.

Instead, she is a sort of female
ego counterpart to Cain: tough
and determined, yet sexy and
brave enough to do it in mid-
afternoon in the park. The close-
up shots of Jack and Jenny are
effectivein creating their rela-
tionship as something very real
and something the story line
cleverly ignores.

She never confronts Carter,
and rarely are they shown
together; in a convenient plot
allowance, we learn her laissez-

FA--.

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

Richard Nixon on June 23,
1972, signed into law what is
commonly called Title IX. This
legislation states: “No person in
the United States shall on the
basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the
beneﬁts of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any edu-
cation program or activity,
receiving federal ﬁnancial assis-
tance.” I

Schools and institutions had
six years to comply with this
act, which was loosely defined
as providing equal opportuni-
tiesfor men and women. The
penalty for noncompliance is a
withholding of federal money.

That legislation is often inter-
preted to mean that universities
receiving federal aid must
spend proportional’ money on
men’s and women’s sports,
which was loosely defined as
gender equity.

According to ‘figures submit-
ted by Sports Information
Director Larry Eldridge, Pitt

spent $3,412,400 in 1990-91 on
operating expenditures for
men’s athletics while only
$250,006 was spent ~ for
women’s athletics. That ‘breaks

down to 93 percent of total“-

spending for male programs,
which constitute about 76 per-
cent of the total athletic popu-
lation.

Eldridge attributed much of
the history behind those figures
to past administrations. 0

Despite the large discrepancy '

between women’s and men’s
athletic funding and the appar-
ent absence of gender equity,
Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said Pitt has not violated Title
IX.

“Title IX is a federally man— ’

dated program,” he said.
“Gender equity is a moral
issue. What we are trying to do
is be fair. The commitment that
needs to be made is to make
sure that we provide a quality
program for all our stu_dent—ath—
letes, male and female.”

Pitt coaches asked about the
issue refused to comment. 7799
Pitt News learned that a memo

 PITTINEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, M'onday,.'August 31, 1992

from Jaynes’s office ‘was sent to
Pitt coaches instructing them to
not comment on the issue and
to refer anyone that asked to

_ Jaynes’s office.

Jaynes is no stranger to the
monstrous machine that is the
NCAA. In 1990 he was appoint-
ed to the 46-member NCAA
Council and he is a former
member of the NCAA
Nominating Committee. While
athletic director at Colorado
State, he served as chairman of
the NCAA District VII
Postgraduate Scholarship
Committee. Recently he took
part in a survey that would
examine the gender equity
issue. _

“I was -on the gender equity
study. I was on the NCAA
council,” jaynes said. “I said at
the time that I have no prob-
lem doing" a survey, but if you
include football you are going
to totally skew it out of range.
Football is so unlike any other
sport because of the numbers
involved. You are looking at 90
scholarships compared to a
basketball team with 14.

“Most of Title IX [mandates]
that you are providing an
opportunity, and there’s not a
big rush out there to add a
bunch of sports,” he said. “Title
IX doesn’t say that you have to
add sports but you should pro-
vide lproportional] operating
budgets, scholarships, staff and
practice time. Those things are
all comparable.”

Jaynes said that comparing
the money spent on men’s and
women’s athletics is like “com—
paring oranges and apples”
because added to the men’s
athletic expenses is $2 million
the ‘football team pays the uni-
versity to play in Pitt—Stadium.
The football team’s revenue
comprises 70 percent of the
athletic department’s cash cow,
according to Jaynes, while only
using 28 percent of the athletic
budget.

“We pay $2 million a year to
do business in football because
that’s what the university has
assessed us as their fair share,”

Jaynes said. “Most schools don’t I

do that at all. Football is a self-

xsupporting enterprise and it is

D-3

  Pitt athletic administration struggles to attain gender equity

an auxiliary enterprise. It is
treated totally different from the
other lsportsl. Title IX isn’t con-
cerned with how the money is
raised. It doesn’t matter that
football raised 70 percent of
the money, it’s not an issue.

“If you look at the dollar val-
ues that have been spent on
athletics at the University of
Pittsburgh from a scholarship
standpoint,” Jaynes said, “and if
you take the overhead cost of
men’s sports out of there

[women’s athletics are not '

charged an overhead cost] it
balances the formula better.”
The athletic department is
allotted a specified number of
scholarships by the NCAA that
the administration distributes at
its discretion. It is the fair exer-
cise of this.power that is con-
sidered the main issue of gen-
der equity. jaynes said that the
scholarship figures seem unfair
because of the large number of
athletes needed to run a suc-
cessful football program. This
year there are 92 full scholar-
ships given for a football team

NCAA violations clud futue of Pitt football

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff‘ Wﬁter

“We must insist that integrity and hon-
orable conduct stand as the hallmarks
of our intercollegiate athletic program.
We must and we are taking a leadership
role to raise our standards in our class-
rooms and on our playing ﬁelds.” — Dr.
_I. Dennis O’Connor (Chancellor,
University of Pittsburgh), May 11, 1992.

These are noble remarks.

But telling remarks, too, from a man
who just seconds prior to the statement
admitted that the University of
Pittsburgh — a school that has long
preached the values of education and
truth in athletics —- had been guilty of
rules violations in its proud football pro-
gram.

At a spring press conference best
described as a public confessional, a
cleansing of the disassociated past, the
University of Pittsburgh admitted to 12
rules infractions regarding its Panther
football program.

‘‘It is clear that certain violations of
established rules have occurred,”
O’Connor said. “We have conducted a
thorough investigation and have already
implemented significant corrective
actions to ensure that suchiviolations
should not occur again.” _

The improprieties, which occurred
between 1986 and January 1991, took
place during the tenure of former Pitt
I-lead Coach Mike Gottfried and ex—Pitt
Athletic Director Ed Bozik.

All but one of the charges involved
the Gottfried-Bozik reign; the other
infraction took place during current
Panther Head Coach Paul Hackett’s first

- season at Pitt. _

“There were a limited number of peo-
ple [involved in the improprietiesl,” Pitt
Faculty Representative to the NCAA Dr.
john Bolvin said. “I don’t think we can
answer beyond that." V

The 15-month investigation, conduct-
ed by independent investigator Mike
Glazier and Bolvin, focusedon allega-
tions that surfaced in the university’s ini-
tial inquiry into the football program in
1989. Following a number of newspaper
articles concerning these allegations in
February of 1991, the investigation was
reopened.-

Since the May 12 admission, specula-

AD Oval Jaynes says Pitt is working to prevent further violations.

tion regarding the situation has spread
over three specific topics: the forms of

improprieties, trends in college rules,
enforcement and possible punishment

by the NCAA of Panther football.
The Pitt Rap Sheet

Over 100 witnesses in 10 states partic-
ipated in the proceeding, including cur-
rent and former student—athletes, current
and former members of the Pitt coach-i
ing staff and administration and parents
of student-athletes. The process found
12 defined rules violations and nine
undetermined but probable illegalities.

The 12 infractions are as follows:

0 On five occasions during the period
between March 1988 and January 1989
a former member of the Pitt coaching
staff entertained groups of enrolled
football student-athletes with meals at
Pittsburgh restaurants for the purpose of
meeting to discuss team issues.

0 In 1987, a former member of the
Pitt coaching staff arranged for an
expert in martial arts to instruct univer-
sity football student-athletes and com-
pensated the instructor.

- On several occasions from March
1986 to February 1990 a former member
of the Pitt coaching staff entertained stu-
dents with meals at restaurants in the
Pittsburgh area. “

0 In the springiof 1988 a chapter of

the Pitt alumni association sponsored an
event featuring a former member of the
coaching staff. Although both prospec-
tive student—athletes’ and prospective
students were invited, only alumni and
prospective student-athletes attended.

0 From the winter of 1986 through
February 1990 a former member of the
coaching staff. provided current and
prospective student-athletes with t-shirts
and sweatshirts at reduced or no cost.

0 During the years 1988 and 1989
three prospective Pitt student-athletes
had their expenses paid on more than
one visit to the university’s campus.

0 In 1989 a former member of the
coaching staff providedfood, t—shirts
and sweatshirts to student-athletes.

0 From December 1986 to December
1989 two ‘prospective student-athletes
worked out in the university’s weight
room under the supervision of a former
member of the coaching staff. This took
place after the prospects had signed let-
ters of intent, a violation of NCAA rules.

0 Without knowledge of the universi-
ty staff, on two occasions former univer-
sity student—athletes who are currently
professional athletes bothcontacted and
assisted in entertaining prospective stu-
dent-athletes duringlofficial visits to
campus. . ' v V

0 In the fall of 1988 a former member

Forbes Avenue

of the coaching staff gave a then-
prospective student—athlete a hardcover
book about the history of the universi-
ty’s football program.

0 Lodging was provided for prospec-
tive student-athletes and their parents in
luxury hotel suites during recruiting vis-
its.

0 In 1988 then-current team members
and a prospective student—athlete
received limousine service during his
official visit to the university’s campus.

In addition to the dozen impropri-
eties, Pitt also revealed nine possible
violations during the same time period.
In most cases these allegations —— which
include coaches giving enrolled student-
athletes cash for both personal use and
as extra “host money” for treating
prospective student-athletes’— lack the
evidence necessary to define the specif-
ic situations as definite violations.

That’s left for NCAA Enforcement to
decide, something they’ve done with
increasing regularity over the past 10
years due to the increased awareness of
improprieties on collegiate athletic fields
 on all levels. '

Join Together with the Banned

The warnings are as prevalent as the
footballs that cut through the crisp
autumn air in collegiate stadiums on
any given October afternoon:

“Nearly half the members in top divi-
sion of NCAA cited for violations this
decade” — The Chronicle of Higher
Education, Jan. 4, 1989.

In an ever-competitive world of rev-
enue—generating collegiate sports —
where the meaning of amateur athletics
has become an oxymoron in the truest
sense of the word + illegal under—the-
table activities by athletic departments
and alumni associations have become
the order of the decade. 9

The traditional gift—giving ritual that
takes place during the courting process
and subsequent playi_ng years of stu-
dent-athletes in _revenue-busting sports

like football and basketball have

become as traditional as the Rose Bowl
and March Madness.

But that’s beginning to change.

Within the past 10 years the NCAA
has caught up with the backroom activi-
ties of the Oklahomas and Syracuses of
the amateur sports world as well as

Perkins, Whaley take charge of questionable secondary

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Despite an erratic pass rush,
the Pitt football team had one

of the better pass defenses in_

the Big East last season, mostly
due to a strong secondary.

Now that cornerback Steve
Israel has sprinted his way to
the National Football League,
junior strong safety Doug
Whaley and senior free safety
Lex Perkins are stepping in as
the cornerstones of a depleted
group of defensive backs.

“We only have two starters
right now," Defensive
Coordinator/Defensive Backs
Coach Nick Rapone said. “I can

Stable of
wide-outs
Still shine

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

Head Coach Paul Hackett’s
desire to re-establish a two-
back running game should not
fool anyone. With a receiving
corps as deep and as talented
as this one along with Pitt’s
soon-to-be-all-time leading
passer, Alex Van Pelt, there will
be plenty of bomb scares in Pitt
Stadium.

Last year, with only one run-
ning back for opposing defens-
es to worry about, linebackers
and safeties were able to ﬂoat
and break up the patterns of
the wide—outs. But now
Hackett’s move to the two-back
set will give Pitt’s receivers
room to move around and get
open.

Although not etched in stone,
there are some receivers that
seem to have specialized roles
because they can do something
better than anyone else. Some,
like Chris Bouyer, seem to be
able to do it all.

Since taking over the starting
flanker position following the
transfer of Olanda Truitt,
Bouyer developed into one of
Van Pelt’s most consistent tar-
gets and one of the Big East
Conference’s top receivers.

“lBouyer is] a possession-type
receiver,” Receivers Coach
Mike McCarthy said. “He does’
everything right. He does
everything the way he is sup-
posed to do it.”

Along with Bouyer, this
squad needs leaders to bring
out its potential. Junior Green
is a player who leads by exam-
ple. Although not a possessor
of great speed, Green uses his
knowledge of the offensive sys-
tem and his running of near
perfect routes as his weapons.

“lGreenl knows the system
cold,” McCarthy said. He is a
smart, complete receiver and
has improved his speed, so we
should see some big things
from Junior this year.”

Another factor essential to a
great receiving corps is speed,
and sophomore Dietrich Jells is
a pure, high-octane burner.

Seé WR, page 13

tell you right now, Perkins and
Whaley will start. That is as
honest as I can be. At the cor-
ner position it can be any one
of the five.

"I have no idea at all [who
will start. The five are] Vernon
Lewis, Derrick Parker, Chris
Hupko, freshman Jay Jones and
then you go to Kevin Williams,
who we took over [from run-
ning backl in the spring. Kevin
had two days in the spring. We
are so young out there it isn’t
even funny.”

One player that Rapone did
not include is former starter
Tinker Harris. Head Coach Paul
Hackett said that Harris will
miss this season as an academ-

ic redshirt. Rapone did not
seem to think that loss was
such a problem, but said he is
concerned about the sec-
ondary.

“We have a problem. We def-
initely have a problem,”
Rapone said.

“-We’ve got some good young
kids  Hupko we have for
three years. Derrick Parker we
have for four years. Jay Jones
we have for four years. We
have youth. We just don't have
anybody to step right in there.
We don’t have a Whaley or
Perkins at corner right now.”

The closest thing they do
have to that is Lewis, a 5-foot-
11-inch senior. He entered

camp as a backup after missing
spring drills. According to
Rapone, Lewis is faster than the
speedster Israel.

“We are counting on Vernon
to be a very—big—play man who
can shut down an opponent's
number-one receiver,” Rapone
said. “He has the experience
and has everything going for
him.”

Hupko is a player who has
stepped up and looked like a
starter early in camp. He said
that he was skeptical of the
move to corner from safety and
still seems a bit unsure of him-
self, but Rapone said he has
looked good so far at the posi-
tion.

“lHe] has fantastic hand-eye
coordination,” Rapone said.
“He’s a great athlete. Hupko
right now is the starting left
corner. The first few days have
been as good as you can be.
You’ve got to remember we are
in shorts. In shorts, a lot of
people look like Tarzan, and
then you get the pads on and
they look like Jane.”

One player Rapone said
would benefit from getting into
pads is Parker. The 5-8, 170-
pound redshirt freshman came
to Johnstown as the starter
opposite Hupko.

“Derrick Parker is more like
the blue collar, out—tough—you

THE PITI‘ NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 31, 1992

Mike Johns
For The Pitt News

In football, a team is only
as good as its defense.‘The
anchor of every defense is the
defensive line. With the early
departures of Pitt’s talented
ends Sean Gilbert and Keith
Hamilton, how good Pitt’s

0, defense will be could deter-
mine this team's fate.

Anchoring this year's defen-
sive line are junior nose tack-
le Tom Barndt and fifth-year

- senior defensive ends Jeff
Esters and Mike Kelly.

“Esters is expected to have
agbig year for us,” defensive
line coach Tom Turchetta
said. “This is it for Jeff, his last
go around.xHe has all the
tools to be an outstanding
football player, and we
expect him to put everything
together in his final season.”

' On the other end of the
‘ defensive line stands Kelly.
He is very solid against the
run and is vastly improving

against the pass.

“My pass-rushing skills are
improving because I’m work-
ing very hard [atl improving
my technique," Kelly said.

Barndt, who must plug the
middle to stop the run, will
share playing time with senior
Dave Kristofic.

There are those who say
the defense is in serious trou-
bleiwith the early departures
of ends Gilbert and Hamilton.

“I’m not going to deny that
losing those two is difficult,”
Turchetta said. “Players like
Gilbert and Hamilton come
around once every so many
years, but we will play with
the talent that is available to
us. .

“Don’t worry, we can get
the job done. We can’t worry
about the past; we must live
for today,” he said.

At — Pitt, Gilbert and

Hamilton never became the \

superstars that their talent
promised This was partly due
to injuries which resulted in a

lack of playing time, limiting
their productivity.

This year's defensive line
brings in lot of experience.
Kelly played in every game
and started in six. Barndt
started in 10 and also played
in every game. Esters has
never started on a consistent
basis but has seen a lot of
playing time.

The Panthers will run a
multiple-front—S0 defense,
which will not allow The
offensive line the luxury of
knowing where it'is going to
be

The jobs of the defensive

line members this year will be
to stay at their positions and
to ﬁll in the gaps so the line-
backers can make the tackles.

“Stopping the run is our
number-one priority,”
Turchetta said. ‘

Esters feels that this year's
defensive line is very team-
oriented. -‘

“I am a team player, an
whatever helps the team is

Esters anchors depleted defensive line

what I'm going to do. I'm
very comfortable with the
defensive schemes and coach
Turchetta’s coaching philoso-
phy.”

The Panthers have good

depth on the defensive line.’

Marcus Royster is a highly
regarded transfer from
Fullerton (Calif.) Junior

- College.

Mike Hal-apin was promis-
ing enough to -be selected as
the defensive recipient of the
Ed Conway Memorial Award
given to the most improved
offensive and defensive play-
ers in spring drills.

The players on the defen-
sive line have some lofty
goals for the ‘92 season.

“I want to win the national
championship,” Esters said. “I

am tired of going back to

Florida and hearing the guys
from Miami brag. We have
enough talent to win a
national championship, and I
want to help put Pitt football
back on the map.”

Big East
men's cross
country race
wide open

By Jim Clark
Smﬂ‘ Writer

Once again Providence,
Villanova and Georgetown will
all be fighting for the top three
spots in men’s Big East cross
country. But BostoniCollege,
Pitt or UConn could pass one
of those three schools and find
their way into the third spot.
Here’s a preview for the
upcoming Big East season.
University of Pittsburgh

Pitt is coming off a fourth-
place ﬁnish in the Big East last
year and will have to deal with
the loss of its top two runners,
Jason Bodnar and Mike
Formica, as well as top-five
runner Steve Forrester. Head
coach Jim Lear must get a
strong team effort-to replace
them. Lear will look to team
captains Tom Swartout and
Waddie Freeman. ‘

“lFrankl Nesko, Freeman and
Swartout will be the main con-
tributors, but everyone on the
team is capable,” Lear said.

Swartout, a senior from
Butler, Pa., placed in the top 10
of the 1992 IC4A steeplechase.
Freeman, also a senior, posted
an impressive time of 1 minute
and 52 seconds in the 800 last
year, and Lear said Freeman
“should be our No. 1 or 2 run-
ner.” ’ A

Nesko, a sophomore from
Media, Pa., ran one of the
fastest times in the 5,000 last
year for Big East first-year stu-
dents. Fellow sophomore Mike
Umbleby, a Hollidaysburg, Pa.
native, ran one of the better
1,500 races last year for Big
East first—year students.

Mike Lynn, a junior from
Lewistown, Pa., was among
Pitt’s top five runners last year.

Junior Brian McCollough
from Butler placed 25th in the
1991 Big East meet. Jamie
Heibel, another junior, placed
seventh in the PIAA AA cross
country meet last year.

By Tom Schneider
Sta_[fiVr1't_er

The Pitt women’s tennis team
kicks off the start of the 1992
fall season on Sept. 10, when it
takes on the.Robert Morris
Colonials in Coraopolis, Pa.
The men start their season a
day later, when they host the
Duquesne Dukes. .Whi1e the
men’s team is missing a few
important faces from last year’s
squad, the women will be
returning a couple of star play-

A ers from last season.

When John Tegano and Larry
Garrard graduated last year, the
Panthers lost their all—time lead-
ers in singles and all-purpose
victories.

Over his four—year career at
Pitt, Tegano tallied a Pitt record
of 54 singles victories, includ-
ing 11 in his senior year.
Garrard finished the 1991-92
-campaignwith a 13-13 singles
record, along with live wins in
doubles competition, giving
him 95 all-purpose victories (51
singles, 44 doubles) — another
Panther record. ,

Tegano and Garrard, along
with steady soldier Joel Orth,
graduated last year, so head
coach George Dieffenbach
must now try to rebuild his

matches to finishthe season
with 12 wins and 11 losses.
_ The young Panthers cannot
yet compete with the stronger
teams in the Big East, so-an
improvement on their last-place
finish in the 1991 Big East
Tournament looks unlikely this
‘year

The Lady Panthers are in a
much more attractive situation,
since Julie LoPrinzi and Jennifer

Jacobs are returning from last

LoPrinzi will be hard-pressed

to improve on her performance

from last season, when she

She led the Lady Panthers in
{both of those categories. Jacobs

and 9 losses (10-4 singles, S-5

By Chris Weber
For The Pitt News

While the Pitt football and basket-

lines spouting hope and
promise for successful sea-
sons, there is another team
on the Pitt campus which has
been the model for consistency
and success.

No team on the Pittcampus has
been as successful in recent years as the
Pitt \X/omen’s Volleyball team. Over the last
four years, consider: 1

0 the Lady Panthers have compiled a
record of 116-34. .

0 their record against Big East Conference
opponents: 28-0.

0 four consecutive Big East Tournament
championships.

0 two regular—season titles (1990 was the
first season that a regular-season champion
was crowned).

0 two consecutive NCAA Tournament
berths. ,

The Lady Panthers, preseason-ranked 25th
in the nation this fall, are a team accustomed
to success, but this season will mark a defini-

 
 
  
   
  
 
   
   
 
   
   

stay atop Big East

tive test for a squad that features no
seniors, one junior, six sophomores and
five first-year athletes. Head Coach
Sue Woodstra, entering her fourth
season at Pitt, said she sees this
year as her biggest challenge.
“This team is going
to be exciting to watch,”
she said. “But with youth,
we’ll also be unpredictable. -We
may play unbelievable one match
and not play well the next. lt’s hard
to’ know what to expect.”
One thing to expect
for certain is a schedule which includes four
of the top 11 preseason-ranked teams in the
nation. But don’t expect Pitt to wilt under the
heat of its outstanding competition. After all,
this is a, Pitt team returning six players with a ,
strong recruiting class loaded with talent.

“This team is blessed with good ball control
and has great chemistry,” Woodstra said.
“They are very athletic and will learn very
quickly.”

\X/oodstra said she knows the standards set
by her teams of recent past will be tough to
match but feels that this team in the end will
be successful.

THE PI’IT NEWS ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 31, 1992

Team play crucial for Pitt soccer success National

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staﬂ“ Writer

On paper, the prospects for
the 1992 Pitt soccer team are
simple: 1) improve on a 0-6-2
record in an ever-improving,
talent-laden Big East confer-
ence; 2) do it without the ser-
vices of five departed, starters
—- notably mainstays goalie
Tim Sobelman and midfielder
Nick Liberati.

Sounds like a return trip to
the Big East basement, right?
Maybe.

But for Panther head coach

'Joe Luxbacher, games aren’t

played on paper  or by
potential. They are played in
September and October; decid-
ed bythe efforts of teams that
commit the fewest mistakes —
a team that plays together. It’s
that togetherness that has to
exist for Pitt to improve in ‘92
 or any year for that matter.
With over a dozen players
matriculating to Pitt for the first
time, Panther soccer starts
another show in the role of
David in the lion's den of
Goliath’s that roam the Big East
Conference. Knowing that he
lacks the money player that can

' _ turn a loss into a win or the

wherewithal to entice such a
come to Pitt,
Luxbacher -points to team soc-

‘cer as the key to surviving the

best of the east in ‘92.

“The thing about a team
game is, collectively — it’s so
cliche — but on any given day,
anything can happen,”
l.uxbacher said. “Some teams,

position—by—position, may have

more talented players. But, that
doesn’t mean that team can’t be
beaten.”

With a 1992 prospectus filled
with a group of inexperienced
first—year players, coupled with
the lack of a true game-breaker
a la Gerson Echeverry of Seton
Hall or Paul Young of Syracuse,
Pitt must adhere to a total team
concept. That means working
in unison  offensively and
defensively.

“It’s not like football where
you have a defense and an
offense,” Luxbacher said.
“When the other team has the
ball, everybody has a role on
defense.

“If you’re playing good team
defense, it’s because ten team
players are playing in unison to
create pressure. Offensively, it’s
the same thing. You can have
the two greatest strikers in the
world, but if you can’t get the
ball to them, they’re not gonna
do it.” 0

Leading the relatively youth-
ful Panther squad in ‘92 will be
captain J.R. Perdue, a defender
who scored two goals and
dished out four assists in ‘91.
Luxbacher sees Perdue as the
player with the capacity to pro-
vide leadership and poise to
team that could add as many as
15 new players to the roster.

Other returning seniors that
will shoulder the “leader”
moniker include defender
Carsten Bishop, midfielder
Brian Pelligrino, and forward
Bill Trappen.

With the loss of defenders
Mike Watson, Scott McCurry,
and Mark Brehm, the Panther

will need strong play from
sophomore Bob Dyer, who
started all 18 games as a first-
year player. Other returning
defenders and midfielders sets
to see substantial minutes on
the Pitt Stadium turf include
junior Andy Tsouris, sopho-
more Charlie Wasson, and
transfer junior Eric Duffy.

While Luxbacher has an idea
of who will occupy the 11 start-
ing positions at California State
of Pa. (Pitt’s opponent in the
Sept. 5 season opener), fall
camp will provide every
Panther the opportunity to
work himself into or out of a
starting spot.

“”This camp is probably the
most competitive camp we’ve
ever had," Luxbacher said.
“There’s no assured positions,
but I have a good idea who
would be a starter.”

“That doesn’t mean they
couldn’t lose it.” a

He added that although spots
are open for the taking, they
won't be handed to newcomers
on a silver platter.

“Someone has to come in
and show me  that they’re
better than (the returning
starter),” Luxbacher said. “If the

newcomer is as good, I would -

stick with returner; the guys
who's been through the pro-
gram.”

The biggest question mark in
regards to the starting position
is in goal. With Sobelman’s
graduation, Pitt is unproven
between the pipes for the first
time in half a decade. It’s a
reality that Luxbacher is all too
aware of.

“There are question marks 
in goal,” Luxbacher said. “For

the last five years, either (Jay)
Kapusta or Sobelman was in
the goal. Now, all of a sudden,
the position is up in the air.”

“I think we have the capable
guys, but right now we don't
know who’s going to be there.”

Those capable candidates
include junior Kirk Brodows,
who played sparingly last sea-
son, and Dan Martino.

One facet of Panther soccer .

that must continue to grow is
the ability-to generate offensive
pressure. In ‘91, Pitt score just
seven goals in eight league
games, but showed signs of life
with the efforts of forwards Eric
Prex and Ted Noethling.

Luxbacher was encouraged
by last year’s gradual improve-
ment offensively and sees more
of the same in the future.

“What we emphasize is quick
transition,” Luxbacher said.
“With our attacking, we were
better last year than in the
years before. Hopefully, we’ll
be better this year. “

With the return of junior
Scott Alexander and sopho-
more John Lopus, along with
new arrivals Todd Graf, J.L.

. Gorsin, and Dean Astorino, the

eighth-year Panther coach just
may see his hopes fulfilled.

On the prospects for compet-
ing in the Big East, Luxbacher
stressed the need to eliminate
mistakes —— Both mentally and
physically. He added that when
you get right down to it, soccer
comes down to “individual
breakdowns”. It is the team that
has the fewest breakdowns that
is going to win.

“Soccer comes down to mak-
ing the right decisions through
the course of the game,”

powers rule
Big East
Women's
X—country

By Jim Clark
Staﬁ Writer

The Big East boasts the
national champions, three of
the top 10 women's cross-
country teams, and one of the
fastest women in the United
States. The Big East is so strong
that Georgetown head coach
Ron Helmer said a third-place
Big East finish can still put a
team in the top seven in the
country.

Here’s a preview of one of
the best collections of women's
cross-country teams in the
United States.

University of Pittsburgh _

Pitt, which finished.fifth in
the conference last year, will
field ateam that includes
senior captains Carmela
Mariani, Laura O’Donnell and
Judy Facey. Pitt head coach Jim
Lear said Mariani and
O’Donnell will be the key con-
tributors to this year’s team.

“Carmela and Laura should
be very good,” Lear said.
“They’re two of the better run-
ners in the {Big} East.”

Lear also said Facey is very
important to the success of the
team. “If she can run strong,
we should be in good shape.”

Pittsburgh native Mariani was
a NCAA All—American last sea-
son in the 10,000 in outdoor
track, and she holds the school
record in that event.

O’Donnell, from Lancaster,
Pa., holds school records in the
5,000 outdoor event and in the
indoor and outdoor 3,000
event. 0

Facey, aAPittsburgh native,
has been a consistent top-five
performer for Pitt.

Jennifer Ray, a sophomore
from New Providence, Pa., was
a member of Solanco High
School’s state—champion cross-
country team in 1990. _

Junior- Mary Caceras trans-
ferred from the University .of
Delaware after being a member
of that school’s 4 x 800 relay
team.

Pitt’s strong recruiting class
includes Melanie Ishman,
Natasha Van Reih and Tonia
Malloy. Ishman comes from
Seneca, Pa.,,where she attend-
ed Cranberry High School. Van

-Reih is from‘ the Bronx, N.Y.,

and she was a champion in the
800- and 1,600—meter events.
.Malloy is from Greensboro Day

.High School in. North Carolina,
' where she’ was a champion‘ in
t the 800—meter event.

Not returning for Pitt this sea-
son are Jennifer l-lrach and
Stacy Wyzykowski.

Lear said he expects
Villanova to finish first again
this year. He picked

Georgetown second, followed
by Providence. Lear said he
expects Pitt to finish fourth or
fifth.

Tailback trio answers Pitt backfield questions

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

Last year the early departure
of star tailback Curvin Richards
left Head Coach Paul Hackett
with many questions to be
answered at running back.
Answers he didn’t seem all too
eager to find.

Besides, with two strong and
sure-handed tight ends (Dave
Moore and Eric Seaman), who
needs to run? Other than in
short—yardage situations, it was
clear that Hackett’s plan was to
air it out. But now, with only
one tight end with any game
experience (Rob Coons),

Hackett is looking in the back-
field for answers  and he
may have found them.

“We finally have depth at
both tailback and fullback,”
Running Backs Coach Skip
Peete said. “And I think that is
why coach Hackett opted to go
back to the offense that he ran
in 1989 when he first began
here as offensive coordinator.

“We have a lot of running
backs, so why should they just
be standing on the sidelines?”

year to fill in for an injured

that he was no fluke, he fol-
lowed that with a 121-yard per-
formance the next week against
Maryland.

Martin played only eight
games last year but finished
second on the team with 556
yards rushing, and he has
earned the starting tailback
spot

“Curtis is a perfect model for
a running back,” Peete said.
“He has a tremendous work
ethic. When he steps on the
field, he is all business. He is
very interested in working on
mechanics and footwork. He
pays very close attention to
detail.”

Williams may have gone

down, but he is certainly not
forgotten. Injuries have plagued
him throughout his career, but
when healthy, his excellent
pass-catching skills, crafty run-
ning and solid size can carry
this offense.

“Because of his size, defend-
ers underestimate his speed,”
Peete said, “but he has the
power to__ run over people. For
me, it is going to be hard. I
think we have three tailbacks
that are real good."

Another back who came out
of the woodwork last year, Tim
Colicchio, has earned himself
the second slot on the depth
chart. Coming off the bench to
replace the injured Williams

against Syracuse, Colicchio
impressed the coaches with his
hard-nosed running style.

“He has deceiving speed,”
Peete said. “He is a lot faster
than he looks —— low center of
gravity, strong — and is an
excellent pass-catcher out of
the backfield.”

Personnel moves have been
made to shore up a hobbling
fullback position. Carl Hagins,
a former walk-on, is the lead-
ing -returner at fullback with
only six career rushing yards.
He will likely share the fullback
duties generously thanks to
surgery on both of his knees.

Sophomore Vince Williams is
Pitt's future at fullback but only
if he can stave off nagging leg
injuries. Williams is the proto-
type fullback — pure power.

“I’m really anxious to see
Vince get an opportunity to
play this year,” Peete said. “A
lot of backs with his speed
would rather run around a
would—be—tackler, but Vince
would much rather run over
you.”

Bobby Boykin _was moved
from backup strong safety to
fullback. His experience in the
defensive backfield has devel-
oped his good hands and
strong pass—blocking skills,
according to Peete.

Sophomore Obie Roundtree
and first—year students Kevin
Rock and Lyron Brooks all
have the size to be effective
fullbacks but will likely see
very limited action.

“They are all great kids, they
are all hard workers,” Peete
said. “It’s going to be a learning
experience. We will just have
to see how fast they come
along.”

D-11,

Senior LiVorio seeks redemption after suspension

By Laini Samuels
For The Pitt News

In the fall of 1988, offensive
lineman Mike LiVorio arrived at
Pitt as one of the most heavily
recruited high school students
in the state.

The ‘88 Panthers boasted an
experienced offensive line of
returning lettermen and starters
such as Mark Stepnoski, Dean
Caliguire, Chris Goetz and Tom
Ricketts. LiVorio found himself
redshirted his first year.

In the fall of 1992 Stepnoski,
Caliguire, Goetz and Ricketts
play in the National Football
League, and the starting right
tackle for the Panthers is
LiVorio. He described the
offensive lines of ‘88 and ‘89 as
extremely experienced.

“Those guys had great
togetherness and great unity.

Solid line

Pitt offense

Mike Johns
For The Pitt News

When you think of Pitt’s
offensive line, you Can’t help
but think of all the great play-
ers that played there for the
Panthers.

This year Pitt will feature ,a,
veteran line with four seniors
as the projected starters. At the
tackles, are fifthgyear senior

Mike LiVorio and junior
Reuben Brown. The guards are
fifth—year senior Gary

Gorajewski and senior Mark
Fely. And along with fifth—year
senior Chris Sestili at center,

’ this should prove to be one of

Pitt’s greatest strengths.

One of the leaders of the
offensive line is LiVorio.
LiVorio is a very intelligent
player who has excellent size

When I was a freshman those
older guys helped me out,”
LiVorio said.

This year, LiVorio and two
other fifth—year seniors, Gary
Gorajewski and Chris Sestili,
are finding their own sense of
togetherness and unity.

“I think that with us being
seniors we can jell just like they
did,” LiVorio said. And likewise,
he finds himself helping out the
younger guys. “As a freshman
coming in on the offensive line
there is so much that you have
to learn. We put in the whole
offense in three days, so they’re
just overwhelmed with informa-
tion.

“Gorajewski, Sestili and I can
provide leadership for the
young guys because we know
what’s going on. We know
what it takes, and the young
guys can look to us to see how
things are done,” LiVorio said.

Head Coach Paul Hackett
recognized LiVorio as a leader
on the offensive line.

“LiVorio has stepped up to
the front and helped the
younger tackles a great deal,”
Hackett said.

But LiVorio’s road to his final
season was not what he expect-
ed back in ‘88. His playing
career at Pitt began
coming off of a redshirt year in
1988. He earned the starting
right tackle position after spring
drills and played in all 12
games that season, including

the John Hancock Bowl victory’

against Texas A&M. At the end
of ‘89, LiVorio won the Ed
Conway Award as the most
improved offensive player.

. In 1990, LiVorio switched
from right to left tackle, where
he started in all 101 games,
allowing just three sacks to the
quarterback. It looked as

in 1989,,

though he would get even bet-
ter over the next two seasons.
But somewhere between spring
drills and August training camp,
LiVorio came to a detour in his
road. 2

In May he failed to meet
NCAA requirements when he
tested positive for alleged
steroid use. The result was a
one-year suspension and a loss
of one year of eligibility. For
many others this detour may
have been the end of the road.
Instead LiVorio chooses to put
the incident behind him.

“People are going to believe
what they want to believe,”
LiVorio said. “By my saying this
or that, people are saying, ‘Oh
yeah, sure.’ It’s in the past and I
might as well just leave it in the
past.”

LiVorio had a year off to try
to stay in shape. The road
began to "look brighter as the

1992 season came into sight.
With spring drills just over the
horizon, LiVorio hit yet another
pothole: a weightlifting injury
left him in need of off-season
back surgery. While the rest of
the ‘92 Panthers participated in
spring drills, LiVorio spent time
working with trainers and
coaches rehabilitating his back.

He doesn’t let the missed
drills bother him. “l’ve done
four spring drills already.
Spring ball is basically for the
young guys to learn the sys-
tem,” LiVorio said. “For the
older guys, it’s more for reﬁn-
ing techniques. My main con-
cern was to have my back up
to 100 percent, and I feel it is,”
he said.

“It’s not so much the year
layoff as it is the back surgery,”
Hackett said. “There are some
things he can’t do but not a lot

CH2)/rrricalidhes still stolrmiing t/oroug/9 Big East . .. and Nation

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

The Miami Hurricanes
stormed through their first year
of Big East football champi-
onship last season, winning the
conference by finishing as its
highest ranked team. Miami is
still the best in the conference
this season, with Syracuse close
behind and nobody else any-
where near the top two.

A rock-solid defense could
move Rutgers to the top of the
second tier of the Big East.
Boston College put it together
late last season and has enough
offense to be a bowl con-
tender. Pitt is probably the only
other bowl contender, but a big
senior year from Alex Van Pelt
is a must.

West Virginia and Virginia
Tech both have some major
holes to fill and will struggle to
reach the .500 mark. Temple
was a bad team last year and
lost most of the quality players
it had — enough said. Here’s
our staffs team-by-team break-
down in predicted order of fin-
ish.

Jells streaked past defenders for
touchdown catches of 46, 58,
and 73 yards and averaged a
whopping 28.3 yards a catch
last year. The part of his game
that needs improvement is
making the big catch on the
short routes, too, according to
McCarthy. ‘ ‘

“Uellsl is obviously a deep
threat, butthis year he and his
game have to
McCarthy said. “Everyone
knows he can go deep, but this
year he needs to become a
more complete receiver by run-
ning the medium to short
routes effectively.”

Billy Davis is another one of
Pitt’s burners. A quarterback in

high school, Davis ' has
absorbed the offensive scheme
quickly.

The Pitt receivers have the
so-called “role players,” too.
Cliff Moncrief, at 6 feet, 1 inch
and 200gpounds, is Pitt’s best
blocker on the perimeter.
Senior Dave Natoli, a decep-
tively fast and very elusive
receiver, looked impressive at
camp by making countless
sprawling catches and will
challenge for playing time at
ﬂanker.

Chad -Askew, although
slowed by nagging muscle
strains, is a strong, fast and
powerful receiver.

Barring injuries, the biggest

problem for Hackett will be
finding playing time for what
Bouyer calls the deepest and
best corps of receivers in the
Big East.

Outlook: The defending co-I

.national champions are as
explosive as~ever. The only

problem they might have scor-
ing points is if first—year student
Dane Prewitt does not come
through as Huerta’s replace-
ment. The secondary may be a
problem on defense, with both
safeties and one cornerback
spot open. As usual, Miami is
one of the early favorites for
this season’s national champi-
onship.

Key Losses: DL George Rooks

ond-team selections S Tim

Outlook: Graves must stay
healthy for the Syracuse offense
to roll again. They also need to
find replacements for two
starters on the offensive line.
Ismail, Biskup and O’Neill give

the Orangemen _a great special- '

teams unit. Graduation losses
hurt the defensive line and sec-

ondary. With those holes filled,

Syracuse could move into the
top 10 in the nation.

Outlook: A big senior season
from Van Pelt : is a must.
Hackett will key the offense on
the run this season, and Martin
and Williams must stay healthy
for that plan to work. The
strong secondary won’t be
enough if Pitt can't find anyone
to _rush the passer. Everything
has to come together for Pitt to
improve on last season.

Key Losses: All-American TE
Mark Chmura, 5 Jay McGillis
‘(not graduated — will miss the

season due to illness)

Outlook: Boston College came
on strong at the end of last sea-
son as the team faced a vicious
schedule. The road is a little
easier for Coughlin’s crew with
Michigan, Miami and Georgia
Tech off the schedule and
Notre Dame as the only tough
addition. The Eagles’ explosive
offense and solid defense could
get them into a bowl this year.
Rutgers University

Broadbent (second team All-
Big East), RB Antoine Moore

Key Losses: All-Big East LB

Outlook: The Big East’s sec-
ond-best defense should be just
as strong despite the loss of
Webster. QB Bryan Fortay,

must come through on a team
with an anemic running attack
(2.9 yards per carry in ‘91). If
he does, Rutgers could move

Most Pitt football fans know
which stars of the previous
year’s teams are returning this
year. But a great deal of people
probably don’t know too much
about the new players who
have just joined the squad.

“We have 25 new faces
added to our team giving us
more speed and size,” Head
Coach Paul Hackett said.

Speed and size seemed to be
two holes that needed to be
filled due to key personnel loss-
es and higher numbers in the
loss column, with a 3-7-1
record two years ago and a 6-5
record last year. It seems at first
glance that these holes were
filled in signing the 25 high
school recmits.

Coach Hackett stated that he
realized how slow the Panther

team was two years ago when
Pitt was massacred by
Oklahoma, a team with players
that ran like the wind at every
position. He also felt that a
great deal of teams have been
signing speed for years and that
Pitt now hasvto play catch-up
as the opposing players ﬂy by.

In taking a look at the Pitt
football first-year class of 1992,
it seems that the Panthers
indeed picked up a lot of speed
and a lot of size. Now the
$64,000 question is, “Can they
play football?”

Coach Hackett said that this
year’s recruits form his best
class yet. “This year’s class is
the best I’ve seen for two rea-
sons: One, we’ve got more

overall speed than we've ever

had, and second, I think we've
got more size than we’ve ever
had, and I think that's great for
the future of this team.”

First year Pitt football players add speed and size

There is no doubt the
Panthers have some burners in
this group. These speedsters
include Dion Alexander, a 5- ,
foot—9-inch, 188-pound running
back from Syracuse who has
already been timed at 4.42 in
the 40-yard dash; Curtis
Anderson, a 6-1, 180-pound
wide receiver from Lynchburg,
Va., who has been timed in the
40 with a 4.3, and Jay Jones, a
5-9 wide receiver from
Warrninster, Pa., who has been
clocked at 4.35 in the 40-yard
dash and is now working at
cornerback even though he has
never played that position.

As far as size goes, Pitt
addressed this issue also, pick-
ing up some real mooses. Jeff
Craig from Connellsville, Pa., is
a 66, 280—pound offensive line-
man; Brian Curran is a 6-6, 245-
pound tight end from Saltsburg,
Pa.; Tim Glass is a 6-3, 280-

pound offensive lineman from
Warminster, Pa; Matt Hosilyk is

a 6-4, 250-pound defensive
lineman from Coraopolis, Pa.;
Eric Johnson is a 6-2, 249-
pound defensive’ lineman from
Chicago; Mike Mohring is a 6-5,
250-pound defensive lineman
out of West Chester, Pa.; Tim
Robbins is a 6-5, 255-pound
defensive lineman from Canton,
Ohio, and Quincy Wynn is a

massive 6-6, 315-pound offen-

sive lineman from Chesapeake,
Va. ’

Tom Turchetta, Pitt’s new
defensive line coach, said he
feels that all his new recruits)
indeed have talent but that it
will take work because these
kids, although gifted, are raw.

“I can’t see any of the fresh-
men starting at defensive line at
this point, [because] there is just
so much learning to do.” coach
Turchetta said.

Pitt Defense stresses worle etb ic with stars gone toNF1L

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Sean Gilbert has gone off to greener
pastures and an obscene amount of
money in the National Football League,
although he was barely ever here. After
four outstanding seasons,. outside line-
backer Ricardo McDonald has also gone
to the pros, as have defensive end Keith
Hamilton and cornerback Steve Israel.
Pitt lost the cornerstones of its defense.

The loss of those players and others
has left the Pitt football team looking for
new starters at both defensive end
spots, both outside linebacker spots and
at both corners.

“On the defensive side, it is [defined
byl youth and more speed,”- Head

Coach Paul Hackett said. “We are very ~

strong up the middle, with our [inside]
linebackers, our safeties and our nose-
man back again gives us great‘ strength
in the middle. On the perimeter, that is
something that we will address at
Johnstown, but we are very excited
about the speed of that group.”

i’l"ran\slation: they really do not know
whom they will have at those positions
this season. * A

“The offense really has to carry the
defense early [this seasonl," quarterback
Alex Van Pelt said.

That could be a very fair assumption.
Defensive coordinator/defensive backs
coach Nick Rapone is more optimistic .

“What we are going to try to do with
those kids [the returning starters] is put
in a couple defenses that will highlight
them,” Rapone said. “Maybe let Tommy
Barndt move around at nose. Maybe let

the two inside linebackers do a couple A

more things‘... make them more active.
With the safeties, ‘we will try to put in a
couple coverages that will highlight
them. You can always do something to
scratch an itch.”

Rapone and the rest of the Pitt coach-

ing staff could have to do some serious
scratching. The middle is not as much
of a given entity as one might believe.
Safeties Doug Whaley and Lex Perkins
are outstanding, but there is little depth
behind them. This has become a con-
cern with Whaley being limited by a
pre—training—camp hamstring injury.
There could be a problem at inside

"linebacker. Tom Tumulty is the unques-

tioned main man at one spot, but
Charles Williams, the team’s leading
tackler. last season, is having problems

A with his weight and a bad hamstring.

Tom‘ Barndt may be a returning
starter, but he was in the middle of the
second-worst run defense in the Big
East last season. He is currently in the

middle of the most questionable area on a

the Pitt defense. That group is the key
to an improved run defense. The bigger
question is if they can provide a ‘pass
rush. The players still with the team
accounted for only 6.5 sacks last season.
Defensive end Mike Kelly led the way
with a whopping total of two.

“Don’t ‘worry about [the pass rush].
We’ll get it done,” Sunseri saidlwith a
wink and a pat on the shoulder.

Very reassuring. Now he has to con-
vince Kelly and senior defensive end

Jeff Esters, the probable starters on each.

side of Barndt. Esters seems to be the
one Hackett is countin_g on.

“He is really the leader of -this group,”
Hackett said. “This is his time. He sat
behind some pretty good football play-
ers. This should be his best season
without a doubt.”

Pitt’s best hope as a pass—rusher may
be outside linebacker Gerald Simpson.
The converted safety has good speed.
The Simpson move may be an attempt
by the coaching staff to find another

linebacker who set a Pitt record with
24.5 sacks in 1987.

monstrous middle for linebackers

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staff Writer

Last year at this time, they
had yet to play even one game
together. Now they are being
touted as one ofthe fiercest
inside linebacking tandems in
the country.

Smack in the center of the
the Pitt football team’s defense,
“The Dynamic Duo” has
arrived.

Entering last season, not
many people questioned the
talent of Charles Williams and
Tom Tumulty, but they won-
dered about their youth and
inexperience. ..

All question marks turned
quickly into exclamation points
after Tumulty and Williams
dominated in a season—openi‘ng
rout of West Virginia. Both
went on to have tremendous
seasons, with Williams leading
Pitt in tackles and Tumulty
earning I the Big East
Conference and ECAC’s Rookie
of the Year honors. _

Williams, a 6-foot—3-inch,
245-pound junior from
Philadelphia, is the defensive
signal—caller. He is fiery and
aggressive. Williams possesses

tremendous strength and
thrives on contact, punishing
ball carriers with his power.
Tumulty, a 6—foot—4-inch, 240-
pound sophomore from Penn
Hills, relies on his quickness
and finesse to track down
backs. That quickness allows
him to roam from sideline to

sideline.

Tumulty has made a major
impact on the Panther defense
from his opening snap last sea-
son, and Williams has high
admiration and respect for his
partner.

“Tommy is a great ballplay—
er,” Williams said. “All the
attention he gets he deserves,
and he’s gonna be even better.”

Together they form a menac-
ing package of strength and
speed, power and finesse,
intensity and enthusiasm. In
addition to great talent,
Williams and Tumulty posses
great chemistry. Their entire
game is based upon a simple
but effective principle.

“[Williamsl helps me out and
I help him out,” Tumulty said.
‘‘I think we have the makings
to be the best duo in the coun-
try by far.”

Williams-uses his strength

and athleticismto take on
blockers, allowing Tumulty to

roam freely and finish off ball A

carriers. They say there is not
much concern over statistics
among the two, just concern

about making sure the plays ..

are made. As soon as one
makes a play-, the other is there
to congratulate him.

“You could have the two

-greatest players in the world,

but if they_don’t complement
each other it won’t matter,”
Tumulty said. “We trust each
other and respect each other.”

“It’s notlgonna be me making
the tackle, it’s also gonna be
Charles,” Tumulty said.
“Charles is a little stronger, so
he’s gonna take on a lot of
blocks and I’m gonna be freed
up.”

Their task now is to fulfill the
enormous potential their play
of last season showed. Their
mentor, Inside Linebackers
Coach/Assistant Head Coach
Sal Sunseri, believes they can.
He knows a thing or two about

linebacking. Sunseri was an All-

American middle linebacker for
Pitt from 1979 to 1981. Now he
pushes Williams and Tumulty

a student of the passing game to create
a high—powered air attack. And as a
result, Hackett has had to settle for
,many strings of three incompletions and
a punt.

This year, w_ith the great depth at
both tailback and wide receiver and the
loss of quarterback Alex Van Pelt’s
biggest targets (tight ends Dave Moore
and Eric Seaman), the Pitt offense will
key on the run  at least for now.

Hackett likes to use two tight ends in
his offense, but with only one projected
starter he hassroom in the backfield to
focus on the two—back set. It will be the
job of fullback Carl Hagins and tailbacks
Curtis Martin, Tim Colicchio and
Jermaine Williams to make it work.

That is a lot of responsibility to put
on the shoulders of a starting fullback
with six career yards rushing (Hagins)
and two bright but unproven sopho-
mores (Martin and Colicchio). Williams
has shown that he can run the ball
effectively but has never stayed healthy
enough to carry the team’ for the long
haul. , ’ , 1

Who may have to carry this offense is
Pitt’s strong and experienced line.
Anchored by seniors Mike Livorio, Gary
Gorajewski and Chris Sestili, this power-
blocking front is very capable of domi-
nating the line of scrimmage. If they are
unable to effectively power-block for
the running backs in crucial situations,
Hackett’s faithin the running game may
wear thin.

Most important, an established run-
ning game will do something Hackett’s
passing offense has been inconsistent at
doing -— controlling the clock.

A tired defense tends to give up
fourth-quarter points. Against Syracuse
last year, Pitt gave up a touchdown with
only nine seconds left after leading for
most of the game. The Orangemen held
the ball for 17 minutes more than the
Panthers.

Hackett knows that running the foot-
ball effectively is essential to setting up
the passing game, but he has still been
reluctant to hand the ball off. The lead-
ing rusher under Hackett’s tenuresas
head coach at Pitt has never gained
more than 700 yards in a season. That is
as much a testament to injury as it is to
philosophy. But consider that Dan
Marino, ‘Pitt’s best quarterback ever, had
his mostproductive years when the
Panthers’ leading rusher gained over
950 yards. Van Pelt needs the run.

But let there be no doubt: this is
Hackett’s offense, and his desire to key
on the run doesn’t mean a diminished
role for Pitt’s deep and talented corps of
wide receivers. -

“I thinkthe two—back offense will
really help us,” senior flanker Chris
Bouyer said. “Back in ‘89 we ran a two-
back offense, and the receivers caught a
lot of balls that year. An established
running game is going to open it up a
lot for us. Last year we threw so much,

the linebackers would buzz out under-

neath our routes. But this year, the run
should set up more one-on—one cover-
age and give us an advantage.”

Last year Van Pelt’s only consistently
open targets were his tight ends, Moore

(who finished second in the Big East
"with Slreceptions) and Seaman. Their

replacement, junior college transfer Rob

6

Coons, is certainly capable, but Van Pelt.-

will look to his wide—outs for his bread

and butter.

Good running teams also have a habit
of winning championships, Offensive
Coordinator Bill Meyers said.

“lHackett] and I have always believed
that to win at any level you have to be
able to run the football,” Meyers said.
“You look at the Super Bowl champions
— they are a rushing team. Even
though Miami [is known for its passing]

they won a National Championship and?

had a 1,000-yard rusher.

a lot of numbers.

jon Hiln./Yb   Put 5
to his final season.

spired in the 34 starts Van Pelt
has made since 1989. The ‘one
constant has been tremendous
expectations. 0

When glancing over his sta-
tistical accomplishments, one
would think Van Pelt had met
all of those expectations. He
has 8,104 yards passing, 620
completions, a .566 completion
percentage and 46 touchdown
passes. He is the only Pitt quar-
terback tolthrow for 2,000
yards in three straight seasons,
including his first year when he
set the Pitt single-season mark
with 2,881 yards. He also holds
the Panther record for 300—yard
games with nine. ’

Now a senior, Van Pelt is the
most experienced quarterback
in college football. According

to many publications, he is a.

candidate for All-American
honors and one of the elite
passers in the nation. He needs
just 494 yards to surpass Dan
Marino as Pitt’s all—time leading
passer.

Van Pelt is not focusing on
passing Marino at all.

"‘It means I played a lot of
games,” Van Pelt said. “That’s a

“lMarinol didn’t have the

same offense. There’s a lot of

different situations. If he would

have had this offense, he prob-

ably would have put up some
impressive numbers. It’s justa
bunch of numbers and stats. It
doesn’t mean a lot.”

There is no more next year
for Van Pelt. He has one more
chance to lead the Panthers out
of mediocrity,‘ and he seems
quietly determined to do just
that. The only expectations he
concerns himself with are his
own.

“This is my fifth year and
we’ve been an average football
team. We haven’t been where
we want to be,” Van Pelt said.
“My whole focus in the off-sea-
sonhas been to get ready to
take this team to the next level
 the level of the Notre Dames
and the Miamis.” A

All the completions, all the
yards and all the touchdown
passes do not appear to fulfill
Van Pelt. He has other types of
accomplishments on his mind.

pushes Williams and Tumulty
toward that same level of play.

“They complement each
other very well,” Sunseri said.
“They play very well with one
another. It’s nice to have that.
We talk about performing to
our utmost ability, and these
guys also care about one
another.”

That closeness is something
Williams and Tumulty pride
themselves on. Williams coined
the “Dynamic Duo” moniker,
saying “He’s the young Robin
and I’m the old Batman.”

Williams describes Tumulty
on the field as “enthusiastic”
and calls himself “relentless.”

Relentless is an appropriate_
description of Williams’s style.
His 92 total tackles led the
Panthers last year, and 46 of
them were solo stops. He also
had nine tackles for losses and
two interceptions. Williams dis-
played his bal1—hawking style at
its best with the 18-tackle per-
formance against Syracuse.

“I watched Charles before I
even came here and I knew he

.was a hard-nosed kid who

always gave 110 percent,_”
Tumulty said. “We’re both real
hard-nosed kids.”

“He’s the power guy. He’s
gonna come in and knock
somebody’s head off,” Tumulty
said. “Charles is gonna knock
their head off and forget about
them. I'm going to try and be
quicker. I’ll take an edge and
wait for them, and Charles is
just gonnablast through. We’ve
both been blessed with a lot of
speed. We’re both natural line-
backers.”

Williams does not appear
concerned about living up to
expectations.

“I don’t really care about all
that,” he said. ‘‘I love to hit. As
long as I get three or four hits
to hurt somebody during the
game, I’m happy.”

Williams said he feels that he
and Tumulty sometimes receive
too much credit for the middle
of the defense. _

“It’s not just us. ‘It’s a lot of
guys: Tom Barndt, Lex Perkins,
Doug Whaley  a lot of guys
make it happen,” he said.

Tumulty’s Pitt career began
with a team-high 11 tackles,
including eight solo tackles,
against West Virginia. He went
on to record 84 total tackles, 49
of them solo. He had a 15-tack-
le day against Southern
Mississippi. With a better
understanding of the defensive

scheme, Tumulty said he
expects to .

“I’m stronger than last year. [I
am] a little bit bigger and I
have more knowledge of the
game,” he said. “I needed to
perfect the little things before I
got the big things.”

Perfecting the mass of com-
plex terminology Pitt uses in its
defense has been a challenge
for Tumulty. Now that he is
grasping more of it, Tumulty

said he feels more comfortable .

as he is lining up.

-“If you know all of it, you
can relax before the snap,”
Tumulty said. “But if you don’t
and you have to worry about
all the motion and everything,
you really have to think about
everything.”

Tumulty said he feels the
relationship between the inside
linebackers and Sunseri is cru-
cial to their success.

“We have the best inside
linebacker coach in the country
by far  We’re all like a family.
We’re all there for each other,”
Tumulty said.

As for the Pitt opponents
planning to run the football up
the middle, Williams has a little
message.

"‘Just look for the ‘Dynamic
Duo.’ We’ll be around.”

guy,” Rapone said. “He has a
great attitude  good speed.
He has all the right things. I
think he’s going to be a pretty
darn good football player.”

Jones could bring a little
more speed to the corner. He
was fast enough to beat speed-
ster sophomore wide receiver
Dietrich Jells in high school
track competition.

“He’s a 10.4 100—meter guy,”
Rapone said. “Dietrich [runs a]
10.5. I don’t think he could
start  he’s in the mix. We are
so young out there and inexpe-
rienced that you never know
what can happen.”

Jones played wide receiver in
high school and Rapone said
he has never played corner-
back before this year.

“We are taking an athlete and
seeing what he can do.”

That may have been the logic
behind the Williamslmove. He
does have the speed to play on
the corner and has decent size
at 5-11, 180 pounds. The
senior’s season is now in ques-
tion clue to a shoulder injury.

“He is pretty discouraged
right now,” Hackett said. “He's
going to spend a little time and
figure out what direction he’s
going to go in. It’s a little too
early to decide now.”

As Rapone said, there is no
decision at safety. Whaley and
Perkins have established them-
selves as solid players and big
hitters. Perkins seemed to get a
little frustrated waiting to get
pads on. A

“I’ve got a couple of people
I’m waiting to get the pads on
for, mostly Billy Davis,” Perkins
said. “He said he was going to
introduce himself to the
defense, so We’re going to get

Villanova University

Villanova is coming off yet
another national and Big East
championship. It’s the team’s
third in a row, and there may
be even more championships
on the horizon.

The Wildcats’ key performers
will include junior Carole Zajac
and seniors Nnenna Lynch and
Cheri Goddard. Zajac, a
Pittsburgh native who attended
Baldwin High School, is the

collegiate record holder in the‘

10,000, and according to Stern

.is one of the fastest women in

the country, including pros and
Olympians.

Lynch was last year’s NCAA
champion in the 3000, and
Goddard finished second
behind her. Rounding out
Villanova’s top five are sopho-

more Becky Spies and senior__

Irene Ruopoli.

Stern said newcomers
Jennifer Rhines, Megan
Flowers, Stacy Robinson and

Nikki Shaw could possibly_

break into Villanova’s top five.
Robinson was Pennsylvania’s
state cross-country champion
last year.
Providence College
Providence’s women’s team
placed second a year ago in
the Big East. But this season
the team will have to perform
despite the loss of some key
personnel.-A top-three finish is
likely with strong runners such
as sophomore Leanne Burke

and senior All-American Sineadl

Delahunty.
Georgetown University
Georgetown Coach Ron
Helmer said his team is once
again one of the best in the
nation. “We feel we can be in
the top six or seven in the
country or in
the top two or
three in the
East,” he said.

will be one of her better teams.

“\X/e’ll be one of the better
teams in New England, and we
expect to improve on our sixth-
place finish in the Big East,”
she said. The only key per-
former not returning is Carolyn
Verdon.

Remingo-Knapp will look for
senior Shannon Lennon, juniors
Becky Jorgensen and Kerry
Clark and sophomore Katie
O’Toole to be the team’s main
contributors. UConn also has
added lirst—year student Kristen

Leahy, who Remingo-Knapp
said may be a key addition.
St. John’s

After the seventh—place finish
in the Big East last season, St.
John’s should be strong for the
upcoming season, according to
head coach Jim Hurt. No key
performers are left, but he
added the New York state
champion in the 800, Alice
Smart.

St. John’s will look to
Siovhan Murphy and Leonie
Codrington this season to put
in key performances.

Syracuse

The Syracuse runners have
their work cut out for them as
they try to improve on an
eighth—place finish, minus four
of last year’s top runners.
Maryjo Dougherty, Michele
Zani, Sarah Martini and Jo
Garton are all gone, and the
only runner returning from
Syracuse’s top five is team cap-
tain Jennifer Foreback.
University of Miami

The Miami’s women’s team is
an also—ran in this conference.
Last year the Hurricanes were
little more than a light breeze,
and this year there are no
storms on the horizon. Expect
another season in the cellar.
Seton Hall ‘ ‘

Last year, Seton Hall finished
last in the Big Easts. Seton Hall
will be led by senior Barbara
Bator. Bator was the team’s
best runner last season, and
she was Seton Hall’s top finish-
er for all but two races.

Defense

Com1'nued_/rampage 14
calls strong. One ques-

tion yet to be answered
is where the pass rush
will come from .

“First of all we are
going to see who can
pass rush,” Rapone said.

h “Then we will put them
in a position that will
enable them to get the
best pass rush. Whether
it is a blitz or a stunt,
who knows?” ,

He does know what
he wants to do to
improve the run defense.

— “We are going to have
the front eat up the
blockers and let the line-
backers make the tack-
les.”

In the overall scheme,
Rapone said he expects
to use as much situation
substitution as possible.

That and the idea of
the front seven working
together a little more is
part of the idea of work-
ing as a group.

That has been a com-
mon theme among the
players and coaches of
what Rapone character-
ized as a “blue-collar
defense.”

If they do not replace
the question marks with
a few exclamation
points, they could just be
blue.

C°'“i"“edf"°’"P“ge 4 That punishment, which two—year probation, loss of two play and cut football scholar-

schools not as prominent  or
as notorious.

As late as February 1991, 30
Division I universities were
under NCAA sanctions, includ-
ing national powers Auburn
University (recruiting, ethics),
University of Florida (improper
benefits, ethics) and the
University of Kentucky (test
cheating, recruiting).

Regional offenders represent-
ed include Adelphi University
(improper eligibility, lack of
institutional control) and
Upsala College (improper
recruiting, lack of institutional
control).

The diversity of these schools
speaks volumes of the escalat-
ed efforts of the NCAA to crack
down on wrongful actions. It
also tells of the level field of
jurisdiction from which investi-
gations are borne.

Despite this reality, all is not
crystal clear with the enforce-
ment system of the NCAA,
according to one athletic direc-
tor caught on the short end 
or long end  of the punish-
ment switch.

Ruling on an Uneven Field

Every school is susceptible to
become the victim of the law
of the land, small or large --
that has been relatively consis-
tent. But simply because a
school is found guilty of rule
improprieties, ones often seen
in previous cases, it doesn’t
automatically lead to a standard
punishment. ..-1.

entails various sanctions and/or
probations in the guilty pro-
gram, is decided by an NCAA
Enforcement Committee.

The committee determines
the specific penalties according
to the severity of the allega-
tions, thoroughness of the
report and other intricacies,
according to NCAA legislative
advisor Mark Jones, who com-
mented on the Panthers’ situa-

-tion.

f‘The fact that [Pitt] initiated
the investigation is considered
to be positive,” Jones said. “But
if you've got serious violations,
it doesn’t matter who reports
them."

Two examples of positive
actions that could help a pro-
gram include a cooperative
program that reports its own
infractions and a situation in
which those involved‘ with the
wrongdoings no longer work

for the accused institution. Both

cases apply with Pitt.

But such seemingly worthy
actions do not always result in
lighter penalties. Just look at
what happened to the Robert

‘Morris College basketball pro-

gram.

The Colonials incurred major
penalties for rules infractions in
1990, while nationally-known
programs like Clemson
University football and UNLV
basketball received minor pro-
bation and delayed penalties
respectively.

Robert Morris was handed a

scholarships and no postseason
or television play for the 1990-

91 year. It is the NCAA’s incon-

sistency in ruling that makes
the process so unpredictable,
according to Robert Morris
Director of Athletics Dr. Bob
McBee.

“Clemson had 15 cases [of
improprietiesl, while we only
had one,” McBee said. “And
they basically got slapped on
the wrist, while we got hit
hard.

“And with UNLV getting a
chance to defend its title [two
years ago], I think dollars had a
role in the decision-making that
took place.”

In a perfect world, punish-
ments would be arbitrarily
weighed and distributed in a
structured manner. If that were
so, Robert Morris might not
have paid so clearly for impro-
prieties that in parallel situa-
tions w‘eren’t punished as
harshly.

If that were so, Pitt could
look at similar situations to
anticipate the price it must pay
for doing wrong: like the
University of Tennessee, which
violated recruiting and ethical
standards in football and
incurred penalties of scholar-
ship and coaching reductions
as well as probation from 1991
to 1995; or Oklahoma State
University, which violated
inducement, recruiting and eth-

ical standards in football, incur-

ring penalties of no postseason

ships (from 25 to 20) through
1991-92 and probation from
1990 to 1992.

But it isn’t so. And Pitt must
wait for its verdict  while
members of the Robert Morris
program live with theirs.

It's a reality that McBee said
he doesn’t understand to this
day. ,

Other than the apparent
money motive, McBee cannot
comprehend the exact reasons
why Robert Morris incurred

‘such a harsh penalty.

As far as using his experience
with the process to gauge the
type of penalty Pitt may
receive, McBee said he has no
way of speculating due in large
part to the unpredictability of
the committee.

“There’s no rhyme or reason
as to how they decide [penal-
tiesl,” McBee said. McBee
added that Pitt’s athletic pro-
gram is on solid ground with
the leadership of the new

administration.

“Pitt has done all the right
things. Dr. O’Connor and Oval
Jaynes are in tune with every-
thing that’s going on. But we
did all the right things, too.
And that didn’t seem to help
us.”

Pitt can do nothing — not
another “right thing” — only
wait. ‘ _

And unfortunately for Pitt,
as Tom Petty would concur,
“The waiting  is the hardest
part.”

him some time off.”

With the summer of
‘92 Coming to a close,

LiVorio is finding a new. ‘

beginning in his career.

“Sitting out last season ‘

gave .me a new perspec-
tive on things," he said.

“It sort of humbled me, I 4

guess.

"Now I know exactly
what I have to do, and
I'm not taking anything
for granted because I
know something could
happen that could end
my career.” 4

He seems ready for the
challenge of a new sea-
son and said he sees an
opportunity to let his
future overshadow his
past.

“lt’s‘ a matter of me
going out and having a
consistent year, proving

that I am able to handle ' '

the job,” Livorio said.
yLiVorio said he is not
ready to think about the

path he will take in foot-

ball following this year.
Right now his focus is on
the season ahead of him
and graduation in
December.

“After that,” he said,
“we’ll just have to see.”

Jaynes said that actionis
being'taken~to_close the schol-
arship gap.'He said that Pitt is
near the full quota of scholar-

ships in women’s basketball
and is one short of full quota
in women’s volleyball,
although he refused to divulge
speciﬁc numbers.

“I think those two sports are
your marquee sports a-ndl
want them in a position where
they can recruit,” Jaynes said.
“In track we added a "couple.
We didn’t add any [m‘en.’s
scholarships] this year and we

reduced scholarships for men.
in football. [I’m] not going to’

add anythingto theimenfs
side untill get the women up

should be.‘ I’d like to do it in _

.. aren’t as plentiful as we’d like
them to be. We’ll get better,
but that is something that
takes time to process; It isn’t
going to happen overnight..." .
Womenfs track will receive
2.5 more scholarships and vol-
leyball will get 1.5 more schol-
arships this year. ’
Another issue in the gender
' equity struggle is equal avail-

ability‘ of sports for both men
and women. V
Currently there are 11 varsity

sports formen and eight for_

women and it is very unlikely
that Pitt will add any sports in
the near future. Pitt’s crewand
lacrosse teams have been peti-
tioning the athletic"-dep‘artment

' to be recognized as varsity

sports for yearswith no suc-

» cess. Jaynes s-aid that in these

tough economic times the ath-
letic department just can’t
afford to create new pro-
grams.
“Crew,
something the University of

Pittsburgh could have-because ,
.we’ve got rivers,” Jaynes said.

"If you go to Kansas State,
there’s no way you could
have C-rew. Women’s soccer is

'anot‘h.er issue. [Pitt doesn’t
have a women’s soccer teaml
.Women’s soccer programs are‘

fairly Common in the east. If
you go to the west, there
aren’t.{ any. You have nobody
to play. When you start look-
ing at comparable sports, you
are looking at comparable
Opportunities for the men and
the women. One of the things
that has become a real issue
with Title IX is that you have
participation opportunities for
your women’s programs.”

for example, is‘

How successful an athletic-

program can be is often
directly proportional to the

amount of money spent on it. V

Jaynes said that this theory is

refle’c‘t"ed—-in the performance.

of Pitt’s athletic teams.

“We’ve spentpretty good
money in tra_ck here to be
competitive,” he said. “Our
swimming programs have
been well-funded, and look at
the success. [The men’s team
has won 10 and the women’s
nine consecutive Big'East
championships.l Soccer here
— we’ve never funded it very
highly, so as a result we’ve
ﬁnished in the bottom echelon
of the Big East. Baseball is
another sport with limited
funding,-and as a result we’re
down at the bottom. Wrestling
has been funded middle—of-
the-road status. Women’s_ vol-
leyball has won five straight

.Big East Championships and

they have been pretty well [-
fundedl.” A

The NCAA, in an attempt to
keep athletic department bud-
gets, expenditures and foot-
ball factories in line, passed
numerous cost-saving man-
dates. And according to

‘Jaynes, these mandates are

going to hurt the non—revenue
generating sports.

g“There’s a number of cost
savings that came through the
NCAAfregistration that have a

'greaterge_ffect on football than

any .otl;ier sport,” he said.

..“They{€clidn’t regulate any of

the other sports, so in the
other sports you can do what-
ever you want to do. They’ve
‘cut back revenue in basketball
and football, hopefully to
reduce cost, but at the same
time [have hurt the ability] to
help fund some of the other
lsportsl.” ‘ I K
Pittraised its tuition six per- ~
cent this year, putting an even
greater" economic squeeze on
the athletic department by
raising its tuition bill to nearly
$5 million by ]aynes’s count.
“Think about what [students]
are paying,” Jaynes said. ‘fI’ve
got to pay_200 of them and I
don’t get any additional -

money to help pay for it.

Whenyour tuition goes up six
percent-, :my tuition goes up
six percent times 217. The

person that pays the most‘

tuition bills is probably athlet-
icsvhere at the university, and
it doesn’t take long to realize
[that the tuition increase] has
made a $100,000 impact on
[the athletic] budget. There’s
some scary times ahead for
us.”

“We may even lose a game
in conference. That’s OK. with
me as long as we stay focused
on our main goal, which is
the Big East

automatic bid to the NCAAS.” _
To reachthat long-term goal,
the Lady Panthers look to out-
side hitteryand All-American
candidate Ann‘Marie Lucanie to

lead the way.  5-foot-10-inch "
_junior from Don Mills, Ontario,
.“Am” will be the team captain

and main gun in an offense
which will be without four of
last year’s top five hitters —
Linda Zols, Dee MacAulay,
Heather Hollands and Sue
Zonneville. The quartet com-
bined for 1,093 kills.“

Last season, Lucanie became

‘the first player at Pitt to -record

400—plus kills and digs in the
jsameseason, recording a team-

" high 493 kills and a team-
-record 457 digs. She was

named the Big East Player of
the Yearfor the regular season
and Most Outstanding Player in
the Big East Tour_nament.
Lucanie is an excellent front-
row player and an equally
adept back-row player. She is a
definite force, with quick feet
and a fantastic attitude.

“She is tough mentally and
works incredibly hard,”
Woodstra said. “We will be rid-
ing her coattails this season.”

Also returning for the Lady
Panthers will be sophomore
setter Annie Mernagh. The 5-8
Mernagh started every game
last season for the Lady
Panthers and did an outstand-
ing job replacing 1990 Big East
Player of the Year and ASICS
Honorable—Mention All-
American jenelle Lantagne.
Mernagh will be a key to the
Lady Panthers’ attack, some-
thing coach Woodstra feels
Mernagh can handle.

“Her year of experience and
maturity last season will help
raise her game to another level
this year,” Woodstra said. _

Other key players will
include sophomore Melanie
Gustafson, a 6-0 middle hitter,
sophomore Chelsea
Hemingway, a 5-9 outside hit-
ter, redshirt sophomore Carrie
Thornton, a 5-10 middle hitter,
and sophomore Tracy Komar, a
6-0 middle/outside hitter.

Pitt might lose its top recruit
in 5-11 middle hitter Jennie
Driscoll, who Woodstra‘ said
may be redshirted for the sea-
son after undergoing shoulder
surgery in April. Even without
Driscoll, the Lady Panthers’ ros-
ter includes new players who
will make a definite impact.
These players include S-3
defensive specialist and setter
Laura Horvath, S-11
outside/middle hitter Sarah
Mikla, S-9 outside hitter Sara
Mitchell and 5-11 middle hitter
Alyssia Yanik. Woodstra said
she expects to have a lot more
players contributing this season
since she no longer has the
luxury of the core group she
had before.

“Each of these players will be
asked to contribute as soon as
possible,” Woodstra said.

year students who could con-
tribute this year. Matt Clarkson
from Greensburg Central
Catholic was a 1992 AA cham-
pion in the 3,200. Rich Crowley
from Cannonsburg was a PIAA
indoor and outdoor qualifier
last year. Dennis Kgntz from
Punxsutawney was seventh in
the AAA 3,200-meter race last
year

Providence College

Last season Providence fin-
ished first in the Big East, and it
seems to be the front runner
again. Returning are juniors
Paul Logan and Andrew Keith,
senior Chris T eague and sopho-
more Mark Carroll. The fab
four took All-Big East and All-
East honors, and Logan was
also an All—American.

‘ Georgetown University

Georgetown was last year’s
runner-up to Providence for the
Big‘ East title. Head coach
Frank Gagliano said his young
team can once again finish in
the top three, even though it

lost Olympian Steve Holman.
Also not returning are Dan
Ireland and Mark Manley.

This season Gagliano will
look to Andy Helly, Brendan
Mullahy, Francisco Quinonez,
Jon Ingram and Mark Sivieri to
pace the team.

Villanova University

According to head coach
Marty Stern, this year’s team
will be the best Villanova has
had in 10 years. His team is
young, while no key perform-
ers have left from last season’s
third-place team. His team
includes the defending IC-4A
champion Terrence Mahon
along with Louie Quintana, a
sophomore who was IC4A
champ in the 1,500. Stern said
fellow sophomore
Hartman is “an excellent cross-
country runner. He’s a big scor-
er for us.” Stern also has Ken
Nason, a sophomore from
Ireland, and Mike Going as his
probable top ﬁve runners.

Stern expects big things from
his first-year students, Todd
Tressler, Scott Whiteman, and

Dave.

Canadians Kevin Christiani and
Matt Lamourie.

University of Connecticut

Last season, Connecticut fin-
ished right in the middle of the
ten—team Big East with a fifth-
place finish. The team did take
second," however, in the New
England Championships and
first at the Connecticut
Intercollegiate Championships.
This year’s team will field nine
first-year students and only
three seniors (David
Cunningham, Stephen Owens
and Bryan Place).
Boston College

Last year’s injury-plagued
team finished sixth in the Big
East. If the‘team can stay
healthy, it could improve on
that finish. It has an impressive
group of newcomers, including
Adrian Hampson, John
Wassenaar, Tom Hunt and
Brendan Ring. Hampson was a
winner of 017 national titles;
Wassenaar qualified for the
Canadian Olympic track and
field trials; Hunt was a second-
place finisher in the national

high school indoor champi-
onships, and Ring finished
fourth in the New Jersey “All
Groups” cross—country event.
Seton”Hall

Seton’H-all finished seventh
in the" Big East last year.
However the team placed first
in the IC-4A University Division
championships and third in the
Metropolitan Championships.

The Pirates’ key performer
will be sophomore Brian
Spoonire, who had an impres-
sive first—year campaign. He
captured first in the 10,000 at
the IC4A Championship in the
University Division. “Bryan has
announced his presence to the
NCAA ‘runners throughout the
country this season,” head
coach John Moon said.
Syracuse

After an eighth—place finish in
the 1991 cross—country season,
Syracuse lost its third- and
fourth—best runners in Gary
Hans and Jamie Navarro. This
season head coach Dick
Coleman will look to senior
captains Nick McDonough and

St. John’s

Last season St. John’s finished
ninth in cross country out of 10
teams. According to head
coach Jim Hurt, the team could
doeven worse this year.

“We [brought in] a lot of
unknown people, kids that
aren’t fantastic.” Hurt said,
“We’ll be more youthful but
weaker than in the past.”

Because of the loss of the top

three runners (Artie Green,
Mike Furlong and Chris Egger)
Hurt will be forced to use mid-

tance events, and he said that
it’s tough to predict how that
will work.

Pitt’s center, Sestili, will once

“We are expecting great lead-

Chris in his senior year,”
Meyers said.

The offensive line must be
able to function well as a

ing I could have done this or that. I
want to go out a winner.  I think
we're capable of winning a lot of games
with the experience on offense and the
enthusiasm of defense. I think we’re
capable of doing a lot of things. As
teammates we expect a lot of each
other.”

Van Pelt said he does not feel any
added pressure just because this is his
last season. The Pittsburgh media has
been critical of him, but Van Pelt brush-

" "es it aside as part of his job and takes it

all it stride.

“It’s the position you play, especially

at the University of Pittsburgh,” he said.
“You take a lot of credit when things go
well and take a lot of blame when they
don't. You can’t worry about all of it.
Historically, Pittsburgh has always been
a tough town to play in with the press.”
New Quarterbacks Coach Chris
Petersen has been impressed with Van
Pelt’s attitude. Petersen said Van Pelt’s
immense experience will be vital to the
Panther passing attack in ‘92.
“Alex is as experienced a college
quarterback as there is,” Petersen said.
“There's a fine line between letting the

, )‘ system work for you and getting that lit-

tle extra by gambling."

Petersen noted that Van Pelt cut _

down, on his interceptions last season

with the exception of the final game
against Penn State when he threw live.
He expects Van Pelt to do well in that
area due to his decision-making ability.

“It all comes down to that fine line of
when to gamble and when to drop it
off," Petersen said. "That's a split—second
decision that only comes with experi-
ence.”

Both Van Pelt and Head Coach Paul
Hackett are more comfortable with the
two-back offense that the Panthers will

run this season. They feel that it should,

provide Pitt with more versatility and
less predictability. With eight starters
returning from an offense that was rated
second in the Big East a year ago, Van
Pelt could have an explosive season.
Although Van Pelt lost his two
favorite targets from last year [tight ends
Dave Moore and Eric Seaman] to gradu-

ation,‘ he may have more weapons in’
» his arsenal than at any time since his

first season. T he. receiving corps is deep
and experienced, while the tailback
spot should also become a major
strength. Expect Van Pelt to, hand the
ball off more this season.

"To throw the ball 25 times [per
game] is plenty,” he said. "You don’t‘
win games just throwing the football.”

- Van Pelt compares the potential of the
1992 Pitt offense to the 1989 offense
both in terms of personnel and

D-Backs

Continued from page 16

schemes. He said he hopes for a similar
balance between run and pass and simi-
lar results.

“I think that offense was very success-
ful,” Van Pelt said. “Offensively, the
core of this team has a lot of the same
characteristics as it did in 1989. We had
a very experienced offensive line,
Curvin Richards in the backfield and
Henry T uteri [at wide receiverl.”

Van Pelt said he believes this offense
is finally ready to return to that level
and exudes a sense of urgency in dis-
cussing this potential.

“As an offensive unit we can't be
labeled inexperienced anymore,” he
said. “The offense really has to carry the
defense early.”

The only real question about Van Pelt
entering his final campaign is how
quickly he will recover from off-season
elbow surgery. His durability has never
been a question; he has never missed a
start in those 34 games at Pitt. Van Pelt
eased the elbow into shape slowly,
throwing only once a day at Johnstown.
Physically, Hackett said he feels Van
Pelt is in good shape but expects his
timing to return slowly.

“I would say it’s going to take three-

or four games for him to get that back,”
Hackett said. “Physically I like what I
see. He’s throwing the ball well and
he’s in good shape, but the timing’s

going to take a little while.”

Van Pelt leaves the impression that
there is some unfinished business to be
taken care of this season. He says that
he has nothing to prove individually but
will not settle for another mediocre sea-
son for the team.

“It’s been a lot of fun. It’s been some
heartaches  for three years now,” he
said. “This is it for me. I’ve had a lot of
fun. But everything I think about now is
what lies ahead.”

What does Van Pelt think about those E

who say he has already peaked?

“I hope people thinkthat because
that motivates me. I know I have a long
way to go to become a good quarter-
back.

"I have nothing to prove. What’s
important to me is what people on the
inside, the players and coaches, think.”

“The difference between a great sea-

son and a good season can be a couple _

of plays,” Petersen said. “We’re hoping
he can make those plays this year.”

Van Pelt says that he feels he will
have many opportunities this season to
do what he loves most: operate in big-
game situations. I

“I like the big games,” he said. “I lik
to play in situations where there’s a lot
on the line. »

. “I want to go out as a winner. That's
very important to me.”

The plan for the secondary

said. ’ -
“[There are] little ways where
we can always be behind them
backing them up,” Whaley said.
“We try to scheme defenses
where the pressure ultimately
falls on [Perkins and myselfl.”

A previous hamstring injury

to Whaley pointed out the

,. questionable depth at the safety
’ position. C

Senior Warren Ware stepped
in some in Whaley’s place. He

three years at Pitt. Ware was
moved to safety last fall but
missed most of the season with
injuries.

The other top backups are
senior strong safety Mike
Heberle and sophomore free
safety Anthony Dorsett.
Heberle was a reserve quarter-
back last year and has not
played defensive back since
high school. Dorsett saw limit-
ed time behind Perkins last
year. I

The depth at the position
was depleted mostly by player

I moves.

In addition to Hupko’s move
to corner, senior Bobby Boykin
was moved to fullback and
sophomore Gerald Simpson
was moved to outside line-
