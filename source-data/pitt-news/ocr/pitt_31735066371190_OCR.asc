Honors Program
breeds success

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

The University Honors Program
offers students a chance to “think
big," an opportunity not available in
the regular university coursework.
according to G. Alec Stewart, direc-
tor of the program.

“This university has been thinking
too damn small for too damn long,”
Stewart said. Since the inception of
the honors program five years ago.
Pitt has produced Rhodes, Truman

"and Marshall Scholarship winners.

“We had a kid accepted to Har-
vard medical school last year. No
one ever did that before," Stewart
said. He attributed this increased
productivity to Pitt students who
were once intimidated by students
from higher level institutions.

“We’d tell these people that the
only difference between them and
those Ivy League fat cats is that they
[fat cats] were born\wi'th a silver
spoon sticking out of their mouths."

The honors program has caught
on at Pitt. Originally, ll5 students

comprised the pilot program in the
winter term of 1978. Last term,
about 700 students were registered
for 30 honors courses. its rapid
growth has necessitated a move
from its cramped headquarters on
the l2th floor of the Cathedral of
Learning to the 35th floor, presently
occupied by the Office of Estate
Management.

“The nice thing about 35 for us
will be that although we don‘t have
significantly more space, which we
could use, the space is distributed in
such a way that we've got more cub-
byholes." he said.

The cubbyholes will be used to
offer both studying areas and con-
versation areas in the honors center.
which was unable to accommodate
the latter on the 12th floor.

Another beneficiary of the move
is The Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review, the brainchild ofthe honors
program and the nation's only
undergraduate scholarly magazine.
The Review presently makes its
headquarters in a storage closet.

ached because a great man had
died.

You wondered why if you
were a child. You couldn‘t figure
out the grownup world and why
it would cause the death of any

in man. let alone a great man.

Confusion. Speculation. Fear.
All were at the front Friday; they
saturated your emotions. For a

man who stood for all men had
died.

And for the second time since
the late fall of I963. a great
American had been murdered.
Again the assasin’s bullet had
dealt a lethal blow to the Ameri-
can system.

For America, it was i not
enough to lose President John
Fitzgerald Kennedy five years
ago, Nov. 22. Now she had lost
another son.

Her people, coincidentally and
ironically. saw both leaders as
inspirations. But these same peo-
ple somehow took for granted
the physical being and the hopes
of each one.

Shock followed the death of
Kennedy. but for the presidency,
Americas forefathers had the
foresight to establish a basic
continuity.

Shock followed the death of
King, but what constitutional
amendment has established his
successor; there is none. King
stood as a man alone. and at
times, alone within his people.

BAS took its boldest action

(Editor ‘s Note.‘ This is thefirst in
a two-part series honoring
Martin Luther King Jr. The
following story appeared in The
Pitt News on January 16, 1969,
the day after a group of black
students seized control of the
university's computer center. It
was written by then-Associate
Editor George Lies.)

Pressured by a seven-h0UI‘
lock-in by about 25 to 30 black
students at the University’s com-
puter center, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar complied “positively”
early Thursday morning with the
“better action for blacks"
demands of the group.

The students. many of them
members of the Black Action
Society (BAS), began their lock-
in at the eighth floor center Wed-
nesday between 8 and 9 p.m.
They left Thursday at 3 a.m.,
when Dr. Posvar signed an
agreement which in effect said
that:

An urban university such as Pitt
poses the same safety problems
found in any city. One obvious
response to the dangers of urban liv-
ing and learning might be an escort
service, but such a project has failed
to catch on here.

The College of General Studies
established an escort service last
year that offered students an escort
from the Cathedral of Learning to
any point on campus between the
hours of 8 and 10:20 p.m., when the
last classes were finished.

According to James Watters of
Pitt‘s department of public safety,
the service met with little interest.

“There was no turnout,“ Watters
said. “Apparently, it was not felt
needed by the students.”

The service has since
discontinued.

Watters said that his department
would make another attempt at such
a service if the desire for one were
evident. He suggested that the Stu-
dent Government Board might look
into the possibility of an escort
service.

Some students interviewed on
campus expressed an interest in such
a service, but with some hesitation.

‘‘I’m mostly confident to walk
down the streets by myself,“ said Sue
Opitz. “I think a lot of people. espe-
cially girls, say, ‘Oh, nothing will
happen to me.‘ I would use an
escort."

One student said he would offer
his time as an escort.

“I would do it," Kirk Shepard
said. “I used to walk girls home from
parties. As long as I was properly
trained. why not?”

Diversity is among the keys to the
success ofthe honors program. Sub-
jects are offered in the humanities
and the natural and physical scien-
ces. Tests show that students taking
honors courses tend to take many
courses in different fields.

“In a university as large as Pitt, it’s
very easy to get into a pigeon hole,”
said Sarbin, who double-majors in
political science and French. “Ifyou
are in the School of Engineering,
you’ll take your two courses in CAS
and that’s‘it. The honors program
provides the opportunity to
exchange ideas with students in
other fields."

Informal advising complements
this opportunity. The honors pro-
gram prides itself on Barry Appl-
baum, a Pitt graduate. Stewart said
that Applbaum has been instrumen-
tal in helping to lift Pitt to national
prominence in undergraduate
academics.

Nuclear Folly

Sirens shrieked, urgent warnings ﬂashed across the display
screen, and had the messages been correct, we'd probably all be
dead. The incident seems like something out of a science fiction
novel, but the nuclear attack warning that was issued on Wed-
nesday, Jan. 4, testifies to the sober realities of living in the
Nuclear Age.

Forty-four counties in Pennsylvania received warnings that
a nuclear attack was in progress and immediately, county
officials responded, but in a completely disorganized and non-
uniform manner. What turned‘ out to be a technical error in a
state-wide AT&T warning system has revealed dangers beyond
the usual ineptitude in modern civil-defense measures. S

1

In some counties, officials waited for almost 10 minutes and
then called Harrisburg to verify the attack warning. In Lehigh
county, sirens were sounded and civil defense measures began.

Pittsburgh officials at the county civil defense station called
their superiors, who then sat in silence and disbelief as they
watched the warning machine during the I0-l5 minute nuclear
emergency. For the few government employees privvy to the
alert, the moments of terror were brief. I

The fact that only one county reacted with the proper civil
defense measures and bothered to inform the public raises
questions of security and priorities. This latest type of response,
especially encouraged by a president who believes nuclear war-
fare is survivable, is an uncomfortable indication that simplis-
tic civil-defense films of 20 years ago are still followed.

President Reagan has tried to bolster civil defense programs
in this country. He has sought to use the_false promise of
survivability through civil defense to deﬂate growing opposi-

tion to nuclear power and weapons — fears that have increased ,

by the Three Mile Island accident and programs such as “The
Day After."

In order to survive a nuclear attack, Reagan has suggested
that large cities suddenly relocate to a “host city.” These host
cities are located in the country, where, presumably, Americans
would be safe fromthe bombs being dropped on the industrial
centers, providing a much-needed weekend in the country for
some ofthat good, clean air while the rest ofthe world is being
incinerated.

Reagan still has a few problems with this plan, such as
informing these “resort” towns to set a few extra places at the
table, say, 20 million. Most of the host cities don't know
anything about the evacuation program. Reagan has thought
of‘ everything to make life as comfortable as possible. Before
leaving Pittsburgh, one fills out a change ofaddress form at the
post office. ,

Even if one ignores all of the latest scientific evidence to the
contrary and accepts Reagan’s assumptions that nuclear war is
survivable, the whole evacuation plan relies on receiving infor-
mation ofan attack. The events of last week’s fiasco prove how
impossible this warning system is. Modern nuclear weapons
can deliver their deathly cargo within 20 minutes of launch.

The officials at Pittsburgh‘s warning center did nothing to
notify the public that they had been alerted ofthe city’s impend-
ing death. Had it been a real attack, the bombs would have
exploded I0 minutes after the officials could have done any-
thing -— not even enough time to pack a few peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches, let alone an entire city.

Reagan's nuclear survivability notions are a farce, and allow-
ing him to continue a foreign policy that hopes if a nuclear war
were to break out, we would be safe in the country-side, is sheer
lunacy and dangerousto the world.

]acl<son’s Syrian trip questionedii

Though I am no supporter of
Ronald Reagan or his Middle East
policy, if one exists, I cannot help
but marvel at his political dexterity.
Reagan refused to even return Jesse
Jackson’s phone calls prior to Jack-
son“s trip to Syria, but Reagan was
still able to prevent Jackson’s suc-
cess in freeing Lt. Robert Goodman
from damaging his administration
by joining in the spirit of the
celebration.

All of America isthankful that Lt.
Goodman has been released. I do
not doubt that only Jackson could
have brought about his timely
release, yet I remain ambivalent
about the whole episode. The Amer-
ican public has been manipulated by
Syria. Assad‘s decision to release
Goodman to Jackson was clearly an
attempt to discredit the Reagan
administration and, in doing so, an

attempt to influence U.S. public
opinion in this election year.

I do not believe Assad, a man who
ordered the cold-blooded massacre
of over 20,000 civilians in the Syrian
town of Hama, was moved by any
sort of moral appeal made by Jack-
son. The Khomeini regime sought to
manipulate the American people‘s
opinion during our last presidential
electioniin a similar manner. Kho-
meini timed the release of the hos-
tages so as to discredit the Carter
administration. Many believe that
Iran successfully altered U.S. public
opinion and is in part responsible for
Reagan's victory.

The Democrats particularly relish
Jackson’s victory, for it hurts the
Republicans but doesn‘t damage the
campaigns oftheir candidates. Jack-
son only seeks to bring publicity to
certain issues by running.

The main questions raised by this
incident are: What will be the ulti-
mate outcome of Jackson's mission
to Syria’? Will other states follow

Khomeini‘s and Assad‘s lead in
choosing with whom they will nego-
tiate (instead of using the assigned
political channels)? Will each coun-
try have the right to designate who
the U.S. representative‘will be‘? One
can only hope and pray that this
does not become a trend.

Jackson’s motives for going to
Syria must still be questioned, even
though he effectuated the release of
Goodman. Personal political oppor-
tunism has no place in international
politics — especially in a_ region as
volatile as the Middle East.

Kissinger group throws money
at Central America’s problems

In a classic case of “throwing
money at the problem," the Kissin-
-ger commission on Central America
has decided to recommend that the
United States shell out $8 billion in
economic aid over the next six years
for the war-torn region. This revela-
tion, reported over the weekend,
represents bad news for Americans

' and Central Americans alike.

Some observers had predicted last
week that the commission would
recommend a doubling of current
U.S. aid levels for Central America,
which would have been bad enough.
But the recommended figure (that's
right-—$8 billion) would nearly triple
current assistance levels and signify
a deepening entanglement in the
enormously complex problems of
Central America for which mone-
tary solutions have consistently
failed in the past.

The commission, officially known
as the National Bipartisan Commis-
sion on Central America, will also
call for unspecified “significant
increases" in military aid to El Sal-
vador, according to a Washington
Post article yesterday. In addition, a
majority of the l2—man panel.
appointed last year by President
Reagan. favors continued U.S. aid
to counterrevolutionary armies

fighting to overthrow the Sandinista
regime in Nicaragua, the article
reported.

The trouble with such proposals is
that they will do more harm than
good if implemented. The history of
U.S.-Latin America relations has
shown that foreign aid, both eco-
nomic and military, has always
come with strings attached. The type
of strings the Kissinger Panel has in
mind. though admirable in that they
seek to strengthen “democratic“
institutions in Central America, are
only more elaborate attempts to
impose typically North American
cures on the Third World, whose
problems cannot be solved by
outsiders.

The Kissinger report, which will
no "doubt be accepted by the White
House, does include a few intelligent
recommendations, such as a “legis-
latively mandated process of certifi-
cation" that human rights
(translation: the right not to be
killed by one‘s government or by
anyone affiliated with it) are being
respected in El Salvador as a condi-
tion for continued military aid.

Unfortunately, the El Salvador
certification process has always been
a complete joke. Starting in l98|.

Reagan was forced to submit reports

to Congress every six months, but
the reports lied about the pattern of
killings in that country. Further-
more, Congress had given itself no
legal authority to deny the validity
of the reports". The ultimate slap in
the face of human rights proponents
came six weeks ago when -Reagan
vetoed the entire certification pro-
cess just after Congress adjourned

for the holidays. Now that a presi-‘Q-‘A

dential commission has called for a
return to the certification require-
ment, there is no real reason to
expect that Salvadoran death squad
activities will diminish, much less
come to an end.

Instead of pouring billions upon
billions of dollars, which are badly
needed here in the U.S. in areas like
social services and education. into
Central America as a way of dictat-
ing social and political realities,
American policymakers should dis-

entangle this country from such a“

losing proposition. While it may be
unrealistic to expect a Vietna m—style
pullout from Central America, a
shift in emphasis away from eco-
nomic and military solutions and
toward sincere attempts at diplo-
macy would make more sense.

, From The Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

Last year, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association promptly met,
I500 delegates representing four
NCAA divisions, and passed Prop-
osal48~— thengregarded asexplosive
material, given its alleged discrimi-
natory academic guidelines for high
school athletes wishing to obtain
athletic scholarships.

The tumult created by black edu-
cators, directed at college entrance
exams which smack of racial dishar-
mony, showed how easily battle
lines could be established. Such
tongue-lashings and heated issues
oftentimes bypass NCAA
conventions.

But, for the second consecutive
year, the feverish discussions will
remain, only the issue changing its
name. Today through Wednesday,
delegates will converge on Dallas to
decide whether one ofthree propos-
als (to rearrange power sources in
the NCAA) should be instituted.

The American Council on Educa-
tion (ACE), the NCAA Council and
the Select Committee on Athletic
Problems and Concerns in Higher
Education all propose to establish

, 44-member boards ofpresidents and

Chancellors. The boards would be

Tying Chancellors down to NCAA triviali-

The list is endless, the point clear:
Each school has within itself an

degree. That includes professors,
students and the various administra-
tors who look after the infinite
branches of that campus. Interest-
ingly enough, a cycle evolves here.

Athletic administrators fall
squarely into a category here. To fit
a university president into such a
slot falls almost short ofimpossibil-
ity. That’s the way it should be. Pres-
idents ought to be aware of

Tying Chancellors down to NCAA
trivialities (when compared to other
pressing matters) makes them police
officers spelling out justice on just

Instead, Chancellors will, as has
been the case since the word “univer-

their police commissioner roles,
overseeing the university's general
welfare. That is, if none of the three

Two days from now, a certain part
of the NCAA’s future will be deter-
mined before the week is even out.
Either the collegiate organization
will be governed merely by several
persons with unlimited power at
theirhands (without adequatejudg-
ment of its best use) or the NCAA
will continue bearing the democratic
symbolism that has made the over-
200-year-old U.S. Congress the truly
representative body that it is.

Students still deciding on a
major can be adventureous, but
most see it as a nightmare,
according to John Haire, coun-
selor at Pitt’s Counseling and
Student Development Center.

Most students declare their
major in their sophomore year,
and those who do not are cata-
logued in the 090 category. The
majority of these students admit
that they are worried about their
status as students.

“It seems like you’re going
through it alone," Pitt freshman
Tina D‘Amico said. “It bothers
me because you feel you’ll be left
behind in some way because ev-
eryone else has [a major]."

Pitt sophomore Julia Dickey
said she believes that not know-
ing her major has interfered with
how much concentration she can
put into her work.

“You don’t see anything;

there’s nothing you‘re working i 

towards,” she said.

Haire said he tells undecided
students that they have the
chance. to explore a variety of
options, but, Haire said, most
students have a survivalist men-
tality «—~ constantly thinking
about if they will ever get a job.

“Its hard to listen when you‘re
terrified," Haire explained. To
make money or not to make
money is the question on the
minds of most undecided stu-
dents. he said.

“A lot of students try to latch
onto a major that will lead to
security and later find out, some-
where along the way, that either
they hate what they‘re doing and
they want to switch to something
else or they don't have the quan~
titative skills to continue what
they’re doing. Then they have to
switch to something else,“ Hire
said.

Workshops are sponsored by
the Universitsy Counseling and
Student Development Center
(called EXPLORE groups) to
help undecided majors develop a
major at Pitt, freeing students to
use nearly 90 credits in explorin
other interests. r

Students still tend to think of
courses unrelated to their major
area as wastes of time.

“I took the weirdest classes.
and they won’t even help me with
my major," Lisa Kefalos said.

But these credits are not
wasted, according to Haire. Con-
vincing students of this, how-
ever, is not easy, he admitted.
They still worry about getting
jobs when they get out of school.

Pitt’s George Allen takes Connecticut’s Roy Broxton insi e during Saturday’s

78-59 loss.

Callan, Lady Panthers burn

Villanova, 71-68 in overtime  

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A sizzling perfomance by Julie
Callan enabled the Lady Panther
basketball team to burn Villanova,
the pre-season favorite to win the
Big East conference, 71-68 in over-
time at the Fitzgerald Field House
on Saturday.

A Callan lay-up off a Jennifer
Bruce miss with four seconds left in
regulation time tied the game at 60.
The 6-1 freshman forward led all
scorers with 21 rebounds, and she
grabbed nine rebounds and dished
off four assists.

“[Callan] needed some time,” Pitt
coach Judy Saurer said. “She had
some tough games, but she is gaining
composure and confidence."

Callan, a USA Today honorable
mention All—America last season at
Willowbrook High School in Lom-
bard, 111., has not matched her out-
standing statistics as a high school
senior, but her play Saturday shows
some of her potential.

“People think a highly-recruited
player can go right in there and
make things happen,” Saurer said.
“She has made some mistakes, but
she keeps plugging along."

ing-scorer for the Lady Panthers,

was held to 18 points, seven below

her average. However. the 5-lOjun- ’

ior forward was a force under the
boards, snagging 17 rebounds.

The win was significant for several
reasons in addition to the dramatic
finish. The Wildcats suffered only
their second defeat of the season --
Top 20 member Mississippi was Vil-
lanova‘s first setback. It was also the
team’s first game in conference play.

The victory gave a boost to Pitt’s
fortunes. ln danger of falling to the
.500 level, the win puts them at 6-4.

“We’ve had some disappointing
losses,” Saurer said. “We knew we
were heading into the tough part of
the schedule with the Big East
games, which represent our only
way of getting into the NCAA
tournament.“

The Lady Panthers were in trou-
ble early in the second half as Villan-
ova gained an eight-point lead
midway through the second half.
But a foul by Sandra Williams, one
of three Wildcats to foul out,
touched off a Pitt scoring binge.

“In the second half, we knew we
had to get the tip and get at them,"
Saurer said. “We couldn't let them
get that 10-point advantage. We fig-
ured if we could keep it at eight, we
could cut it."

The lead continously flip-flopped

Haven't we seen this movie
before? '

“We were lethargic out there. We
played a terrible game. We should
have beat this team on our home
court."

Those were Panther head coach
Roy Chipman’s words after last
years 71-67 loss to Connecticut in
their Big East opener at the Fi_tz-
gerald Field House.

The only script changes in Satur-
day’s Big East home opener came in
the final score, 79-58, or last year‘s
loss plus 17 points of humiliation.

“We were never in the game from
the start,“ Chipman said Saturday,
“and it got progressively worse."

Actually, the Panthers were in the
game as late as the 3:29 mark of the
first half when- freshman Curtis
Aiken hit on a 19-foot jump shot to
cut the Huskie lead to one, 26-25.

But a Connecticut surge late in the
half sent the Huskies to the intermis-
sion with a relaxing seven point lead,
and they went on to claim 17 of the
next 23 points to make it 43-31.

“The key was right before the
half," said Connecticut’s head coach
Dom Perno. “We came down with a
little cushion.”

The Huskies turned that cushion
into a bed of feathers in the second
half. Nobody in the Pitt locker room
felt very tickled, though.

“The coaching staff is disap-
pointed and embarrased at the effort
[the players] gave,” Chipman said.

Chipman was more than disap-
pointed when ’ his two starting
guards Billy Culbertson and George
Allen showed up late for the team
breakfast. In a week during which
guard Bryan Mitchell announced his
transfer and Charles Thompson
proved academically ineligible, the
late entrance by Culbertson and
Allen came as an added distraction.

“Those are distractions you don't
need,“ Chipman said. “If you disci-
pline them, you have a problem. 11'
you don’t, you have a problem."

Along with the breakfast table,

rerun pitiful in 79-58 loss

the Panther backcourt has had an
equally difficult time finding the

basket with any kind of consistency. "

Emergency starters Joey David and
Aiken combined with Allen and
Culbertson to shoot a combined
eight for 32 from the floor.

“Their guards beat our guards like
a drum all afternoon," Chipman
said. “They dictated everything that
happened in the game."

Connecticut starters Earl Kelley,
last year's Big East Rookie of the
Year, and Karl Hobbs countered
with 34 points, and Vernon Gis-
combe added six more in relief. The
Huskies also got some surprising
shooting from their starting 6-7 for-

‘wards Eddie Williams and Roy‘

Broxton, who combined for 30
points.

“We were coming off a loss at
Georgetown, where we shot pretty
poorly,” Williams said. “We wanted
to redeem ourselves.

“We ran the break about as well as
we have all season.”

Pitt’s Clyde Vaughan managed
only 15 points after his career high
37 last Wednesday at Boston Col-
lege. Vaughan connected ononly six
of 18 from the field.

“We didn’t get him the ball in
good spots," Chipman said. “Our
guards didn’t penetrate. Some-
body's got to get it to him.”

Connecticut had prepared a spe-
cial defense to use against Vaughan
should he come out shooting well,
but the Huskies saved it.

“We had some things set up, and
we held up to see how he came out,”
Perno said.

“Many people had written us off
after the loss to Georgetown,” Perno
said. “That's OK, it took some of the
pressure off. Everythingjust flowed
our way when it had to."

And everything that goes around
comes around, and the Panthers
have‘~come around to where they
were last year. Tonight they travel to
Villanova to play the 3-7, 0-2
Wildcats. ‘

“We have to get ourselves up,"‘

Chipman said.

Chipman probably meant that

After having the opportunity to react, Chipman made clear that
neither he nor the coaching staff held any animosity toward Mitchell.
“Basically, what Bryan is saying is accurate,” Chipman said Friday.
“Its a coaching decision whether Bryan plays or not. It isn’t just my
decision. The final decision is mine, but that only comes after consult-

Mitchell was upset and said that the coaching staff had treated him

‘‘I’m not upset with Bryan,” Chipman said. “I hope for him what he
has made is a mature, rational decision.

“He came to us and told us he was interested in transferring, and we
told him that we would help in any way we could. We’ve even made
phone calls for him to help with the transfer.”

Coaching matters, such as the Mitchell situation, are faced by

“You can’t let a thing like this affect the way you make decisions,”
Chipman said. “You want to be fair. I'm not going to say I’m always
right. In my eyes, he wasn't one of the top four guards on the team.”

Chaos  

David surviving changes

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

It didn't take ‘Pitt basketball
coach Roy Chipman that long to
finally understand what this Con-

to Pitt on Saturday, but the obvious
absence of his face with around 2:30
to go told all and confused few ofthe

There sat Chipman, consumed by
deep anger, his sullen face buried in
his left hand while UConn went on
to a 2I-point margin of victory 79-
58. 2

Similar frustration has recently
engulfed this Panther team.’ Only
two weeks ago, sophomore guard
Joey David spelled out discontent
over what he considered to be his
improper use. Chipman was bent on
a three-guard rotation of Billy Cul-
bertson, George Allen and frosh
Curtis Aiken.

Then. less than a week ago,

found out he‘d only be seeing class-
room boards for three months due
to academic deficiencies.

The icing on this fragmented cake
didn’t come until two days ago.
when Chipman erased Allen and
Culbertson from the starting lineup
after both failed to arrive on time for
Saturday’s 8 a.m. team breakfast.

“I can't tell you why we're not up,"
Chipman remarked after the Panth-
ers fell to 8-3, 0-2. “I don't have a
psychological answer. There is a
question mark on the teammates’
part -—- they're concerned about
what happened. That benching is
not a way to get ready for a big
basketball game.

“When your two starting guards
can't get to breakfast, that tells me
there's something wrong. lfyou dis-
cipline them, you have a problem; if
you don't, you have a problem Kids
start to second-guess each other.“

No matter what it took to plant
himselfon the varnished pine, David
took advantage of the Panthers'
latest soap episode by making sure
he made the most of starting along-
side Aiken to reverse ai weak-
nesses Chipman’s staff may have
pinpointed in benching him.

“I'm not surprised," David
quipped over his first start this sea-
son. ‘‘I'm ready to play. If there's
anything I'm told to do, I can do it
and play my hardest."

David’s game stats and Chip-
man‘s disappointment don't exactly
back that up; UConn’s crack point-
producing duo of Earl Kelley (20
points) and Karl Hobbs (I4) left Pitt
behind all game and stymied the
Panthers‘ outside shot.

That included holding David to
two of seven from the field, and
seven points overall.

“I can't judge my performance on
one shot," David said of his first-half
stint. “I know I can hit thejumpers;
if I can't make one, I'm not going to
pack my bags and go home."

No, but if David intends to see
more floor action, there may be
some insight in pointing out how
unglued he became when Hobbs
brought the ball upcourt in the Hus-
kies’ usual run-and-gun style of play.
But then again, Chipman hedged on
his team's setting basketball back
about a millenium.

“Our guards were just sitting
around. To get them in the game, we
had to scream at them. Otherwise, it
was a I half-assed effort. Clyde
[Vaughan] can't pass to himself. He
has to get the ball to score," Chip-
man said.

Arousing a defense to that, David
added, “Since Hobbs (5-8) is so
small, we were concentrating more
on. Kelley. We weren't playing that
closely off Hobbs."

“They just destroyed our guards,"
said Chipman, referring to Kelley
and Hobbs. “They dictated what
went on in the game. I don't think
any guard played to say he is our
superstar. No one performed to that
effect."

Whatever pride David lost after
playing Pitt's sixth man last year and
providing a deadly outside shot in
crucial situations, he found again
Saturday, even though he was
inserted by necessity and not choice.

“I was happy at first that I got a
little more playing time [today]. I
hope it stays that way; The more I'm
used,‘ the more consistency I'll
gather. Sometimes, I would play
[earlier] for a half and only be in
there four, five, six minutes and then
not at all," David said.

From here on in, anything is pos-
sible as the Panthers near the point
of reverting tojust about anything to
slow a two-game losing skid.
Tonight, at VilIanova's Field House,
the setting will not be conducive to
Chipman's finding his first Big East
win.

“After losing a game on the home-
court and then going down to .win
one on the'road...It’s tough to win
one.“ By now, Chipman was
whispering.

first collegiate meet, totaled the
second-highest score (33.75) in the
all—around competition and won the
balance beam with a mark of 8.55.

“Alisa had a great first meet,"
team captain Sara Strickland said.
“She was real consistent.“

Former two-time All-America
Lisa Shirk, who was redshirted last
season, made a triumphant return.
leading Pitt. Shirk was provided
with little competition, winning
three of the four events and totaling
the top all-around score, 35.85.

In the vault, she scored a 9.3. On
the uneven parallel bars, she pro-
duced a 9.45. and her third victory
came in the floor exercise, where
Shirk tied New Hamsphire‘s top
competitor. Jayne Dean, with an 8.9
mark. ’

“We did a good job." Shirk said.
“We have a lot to improve on, but it
was a good upset.”

She rated her performance as
“fair" and said that her scores are

i’ “not near where l wantthem."

Sanft said she was especially
pleased with Shirk‘s ability to main-
tain concentration throughout the
meet after having been out of com-
petition for so long.

An opening win over the l2th-
ranked Wildcats (5-l) should instill
confidence among the Lady Panth-
ers, especially considering that New
Hampshire competed in four pre-
vious meets and that the Lady
Panthers had little opportunity to
prepare following Christmas break.

“We worked really hard this
week," Martin said. “This team
[New Hampshire] has always given
us a hard time. Last year, they beat
us by l0 points."

The victory should improve the
Lady Panthers‘ No. 20 ranking. also.

“This is a big win for us regionally
and nationally,” Sanft said. “We
didn't throw everything at them. We
still have a lot of work to do. but l‘m
confident that we have the people to
do it.“
