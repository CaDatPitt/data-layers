Workers find flammable chemicals in Clapp

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

The discovery of several
bottles containing an
expired flammable chemi-
cal in Clapp Hall caused
the cancelation of classes
and blocked Fifth and
Ruskin avenues on
Thursday.

Safety measures actually
began Wednesday around
5:30 p.m., when bottles of
isopropyl ether were found.
All students and personnel
were evacuated from the
building.

Isopropyl ether is a flam-

mable chemical used as a
solvent and a reagent.

“It is a common liquid to
have in a laboratory,” said
Ken Service, Pitt
spokesman.

The problem wasthat the
substance had begun to
decompose and crystalize,
causing the potential for an
explosion or a fire. Service
said the substance was
found by environmental
affairs workers cleaning

"out the storage area.

“It was on the back of a
storage shelf,” Service
said. “It must have been
overlooked in previous

clean-ups.”

According to Service,
there was no danger in the
substance sitting on the
shelf, but its removal is
what had university offi-
cials concerned.

Clean Harbors, the com-
pany that normally picks up
chemical waste from the
university, called the
Reactive and Explosive
Material Training
Corporation from
Branchville, N.J., to assist.

“The substance was
potentially explosive. and
therefore unshippable,”
said Scott Legg, a customer

service representative for
Clean Harbors. “REMTC
took the explosiveness
away, so it can now be
safely transported.”

Bob Greco, the explo-
sives technician at
REMTC, said opening the
containers could cause the
ether to burst into flames.

“Twisting the cap creates
shock, heat and friction
which could ignite a flame
ball,” Greco said.

The explosion or fire
wouldn’t have reached
beyond the basement of
Clapp.

Students
learn how
to dress
for work

By Cesca Antonelli
For The Pitt News

Graduating seniors and
alumni were given an
opportunity to take a look
at another aspect of work
life at the “Sharpen Your
Professional Image” fash-
ion show last Thursday in
the William Pitt Union.

The show was part of the
Opportunities ‘95:
“Passport to your Future”
presentation .put on by the
Placement Service to help
students learn about
options that are available
to them after graduation.
The fashion show was
coordinated by Freida
Kinney and Maureen May,
two placement counselors.

“We wanted to make sure
students were informed
about what was appropriate
dress,” said Lisa Perry, a
placement counselor and
Opportunities ‘95 coordi-
nator. .

The show was full of
laughter from both on- and
off-stage. The spotlighted
models pranced around the
stage as they showed off
their outfits. With the
upbeat music, it seemed
students, both models and
audience members alike,
were having fun.

“This isn’t a normal
fashion show — no glitz,
no glamor, but lots of
excitement,” Perry said.
“We wanted to give stu-
dents a variety of different
interests. I think fashion
shows are just fun any-
way.”

All the models at the
show were students.
Admission was free, and
there were career-related
raffle prizes. There were
also two student make-

overs done by Style by"

Cardamone. The clothing
was provided by stores like
Syms and Casual Corner,
which have prices that are
more accessible to stu-
dents.

“We could have gone
with some of the more
well-known companies,
but we wanted to fit the
student budget,” Perry
said.

The presentation was
given by Joyce Royster—
Fullum, a professional
image consultant, who
spoke about the need for
action in order to achieve
dreams. She advocates
sleep, skin care and exer-
cise to make a good first
impression in an interview
situation.

If you have ever wondered how civiliza-
tion as we know it now ca.me'to be, you can
find your answer in the Cathedral of
Learning.

A cradle of religions and civilizations lies

in one of the historical classrooms in the
Cathedral. The room is the Syria-Lebanon
room. .
Although this room is titled as the Syria-
Lebanon room, the culture it displays is a
mixture of several other cultures —— Iraqi,
Palestinian, Persian, Turkish, Byzantine and
Venetian — as well.

Not only has this culture given "us
monotheistic religion, but it also provided
mankind with the beginnings of modern sci-
ence and scientiﬁc thinking.

‘The room symbolizes for American stu-
dents that land, which, because of its inclu-
sion of Phoenicia and Palestine in its ancient
boundaries, has been of greater signiﬁcance
to mankind — intellectually and spiritually
—— than any- other land of equal size, or of
any size,” said Phillip K. Hitti, a famed
scholar of semitics, when the room was dedi-

cated in 1941.

“It is the land which gave the world two '

monotheistic religions, Judaism and
Christianity, and was closely related to the

3

rise and development of a third religion.
Islam," he added.

The land and thus the room include in their
culture the region known as Mesopotamia.
presently Iraq, which produced the first civi-
lization. This is the region where organized
govemment began, under the famous codes
of Harnmurabi.

The room includes Persia in its melting pot
of ancient cultures. Persia is the land where
medieval medicine thrived in the likes of Ibn
Sina and Rhazes, two medical practitioners
of the time.

Persian inﬂuence in the room is displayed
in the painted decorations, which are geomet-
rical in shape, suggesting the design of a
Persian rug. The ﬂoral forms on the painted
linden walls also suggest a Venetian back-
ground and thus Renaissance art. The carpet
in the center of the room is a Dergazin carpet
from the Dhagestan province in the
Caucasus.

The most important part of the room is the
wall opposite the entrance. This is where the
Muslim placed his prayer rug and faced the
Mihrab wall in the direction of Mecca, the
birthplace of Moharnmed.

Meeting  

‘From page I

briefly outlined the Master
Space Plan as it pertains to
student housing.

“The Oakland of tomor-
row should be better than

the Oakland of today,”

McManus said. “The univer-
sity’s progress enhances the
neighborhood.”

According to McManus,
Pitt does have plans to
increase undergraduate and
graduate student on-campus
housing. These plans
include moving all off-cam-
pus fraternity houses on
campus, two new dormito-
ries somewhere in central
Oakland and the develop-
ment of the Housing
Resource Center in Oakland,
to help solve the on-campus
housing shortage.

Several Oakland residents
disagreed with McManus by
arguing that Pitt has done

very little in the past to try
to better the Oakland com-
munity.

One North Oakland resi-
dent commented that the
university tore down the
Syria Mosque, a historical
landmark, to build a parking
lot. Not much, she argued,
can be said about Pitt’s his-
tory of promising positive
change. '

McManus’ only response
was that he was not there to
defend past actions of the
university, “but to try and

solve the current problems _

and changes of the future.”
The university has spent a
great amount of time and
money improving the exist-
ing on—campus residence
halls.

Residents said they feel
that it is more important to
get students out of Oakland
neighborhoods and into uni-

versity housing, rather than
cleaning up the residence
halls.

“Will all this improve the
quality of life in Oakland?
Will it enable us to work
well with the Oakland com-
munity ‘and can it be done?”
were just some of the ques-
tions that McManus pro-
posed in reference to the
overall intent of the Master
Space Plan.

These questions, he said,
can only be answered by
those who are willing to
make a definite stand for
change.

Saturday’s workshop dealt
mainly with student hous-
ing. Two more workshops
are scheduled —- one each in
October and November.
Those workshops will deal
with public space improve-
ments and a developed zon-
ing plan for Oakland.

“The person removing
the containers would
absorb most of the impact,”
Greco said.

Greco’s job was to open
the containers and neutral-
ize the ether. He used a
machine called a blaster’s
box to unscrew the caps.
This device opened the
containers within a sealed
unit so if there was an
explosion it could be con-
tained.

“One of the bottles had
visible crystals,” Greco
said. “I saw smoke, so
there was some explosive
activity. But it was con-

Chain

-From page 1

Graf and his wife Ruth, who
live in Pittsburgh, came out to
participate in the Life Chain
for the fourth year.

The Life Chain is practiced
in a prayerful mode, accord-
ing to Cunningham. A code of
conduct is printed on.the back
of each sign to emphasize the
peaceful manner in which it is
to be held.

“This is not any kind of
protest,” Cunningham said.
“It’s just a prayerful, silent
event.”

But the silence was coun-
tered as pro-choice demon-
strators marched along Fifth
Avenue chanting “keep abor-
tion safe, keep abortion legal,”
carrying signs displaying pro-_
choice messages.

Prior to the event, several
local churches, including
Bellefield Presbyterian
Church, St. Paul’s Cathedral
and Ascension Episcopal
Church, held prayer services.
A non-denominational prayer
service was held at Central
Catholic High School in
Oakland.

In addition to Life Chains
held across the nation, 10 oth-
ers were also held in
Southwestern Pennsylvania in
Butler, Beaver, Uniontown,
Natrona Heights, Cranberry,
Greensburg and New -Castle.

A pro-life group,
Pennsylvanians for Human
Life, Southwest, gathered at
Magee Women’s Hospital in
Oakland during the Life Chain
to display the anti-abortion
message, according to
Cunningham.

They chose Magee because
early and late abortions are
performed there, Cunningham

said. “The law allows abortion A

up to the day of birth,” she
said.

Following the Life Chain, a
reception sponsored by
Pennsylvanians for Human
Life was held in the William

you pay for my child!” '

Sophomore Ryan Minster got
Stuck in the middle of the debate
as he waited for a bus outside the
William Pitt Union. Although he

did not take sides, he said he_

thought the whole idea was good
for the student body.

“I think it’s good that they’re
both using their right to protest,”
Minster said. “So many people
complain about things, especially
on campus, but few exercise their
right to protest.”

Graduate student Richard
Thompson agrees. He was one of
the two men who marched with
the pro-choicers.

“Being male, I feel strongly
about the right for a woman to
choose, because I’m not a woman
and it’s only a choice a woman
can make,” Thompson said. “It
shouldn’t be a choice made by
500 men in Washington.” ,

Members of CWO said they
chose to attend as a “counter
voice” to the pro-life opinion.

“We wanted to voice our opin-

ion,” Sitnick said. “The pro-life ~

chain/rally is a chance for us to
Show our view. We have to stand
up for our beliefs.”

Opinions
Frogger, Pitt-style

Does anyone know the theme to the Road Runner cartoon? If
you do, you may have noticed yourself feeling an uncontrol-
lable urge to hum it while you are trying to get to or from class-
es around here.

Maybe this situation sounds familiar —— you are about one
minute away from being late to class, you’re tryingto get half-
way across campus, you step into the street and see a PAT bus
driver with an evil grin turning the wheel and aiming directly at
you. Or maybe you are riding your bicycle to class hoping that
your version of “wheels” might prevent you from being late
(since it’s faster than walking) and you have an epiphany as
that guy in the Honda next to you makes every possible effort
to flatten your bike into the pavement.

If either of these situations sounds familiar, which they prob-
ably do, then you face the same problem as nearly every pedes-
trian or bicyclist in Oakland. The streets are unsafe-for anyone
not armed with two tons of steel, rubber and wiring. Sexism?
Racism? No, no, this is something we all have in common —
pedestrianism.

While none of us can claim to be traffic engineering experts,
it is obvious that something needs to be done to make it a little
safer for those of us who are not blessed with cars to travel four
blocks to class every day. We each take our lives into our own
hands when we leave our places of residence and step into the
path of a car that wasn’tthere three seconds ago.

The bus lane on Fifth Avenue presents problems every year.
This street kind of resembles the arcade game Frogger, with
students as the little amphibians. Freshmen come to Oakland

every year without anyone bothering to mention this extra haz-

ard to them, and inevitably someone comes close to being frog
soup. Would it create that much of a problem to re-route traffic
from the bus lane to Forbes Avenue? Shutting down the bus
lane would also create an extra lane for traffic going the normal
way, possibly making the commute from Oakland a little easier.

There’s also a big problem with Bigelow Boulevard (the one
between the Cathedral and the William Pitt Union). Have you

"ever tried to cross that street at what is supposed to be the
“cross-walk?” Then you know that apparently some drivers
have never heard of the little rule, “Pedestrians have the right
of way.” (You’ve surely seen the “What-the-hell-do-you-think-
you-are-doing-getting-in-my-way” look from drivers in this
area.) This “cross-walk” is nothing more than an invitation for
students to take their lives into their own hands in order to get
to and from classes.

The Master Space Plan for Pitt’s future suggests shutting

‘down Bigelow between Forbes and Fifth avenues in order to
make it a little bit safer for pedestrians. This is a wonderful
suggestion. It would not be that difficult to drive one more
block to Bellefield, turn left and there you are at Fifth. If this
can’t be done, the university should seriously consider an over-
street walkway like the one over Forbes.

Until something is done to stop the Oakland version of
Frogger, be careful. Look BOTH ways on Fifth before crossing,
and don’t let yourself become a stamp on the side of someone’s
car.

Cop

killer Abu-Jamal is

guilty

Plyilozclelp/yioz DA accepts only tlaefozcts

he truth has taken it on
the chin from a well-‘

oiled, well-financed
propaganda machine bent on
perverting justice as it sub-
verts the facts of the trial of a
convicted cop killer, Mumia
Abu—Jamal. The effort has
been aided by lawyers who
will say anything, no matter
how false, to attract publicity
and by attention-seeking
celebrities and spin doctors
who attract it all too easily.
This we know from the trial
record: In the early hours of
Dec. 9, 1981, Danny
Faulkner, a 26-year-old
police officer in uniform,
stopped a car driven by Abu-
Jamal’s brother, William
Cook, in downtown
Philadelphia. Cook began to
struggle with Faulkner when
the officer tried to handcuff
him. Abu-Jamal, driving a
cab in the area, arrived and,
running up behind the officer,
put a bullet in his back.
Before collapsing, Office
Faulkner shot Abu-Jamal in
the chest. Abu-Jamal went up
to the supine officer and shot
him between his eyes, killing
him. Then he sat down on the
curb, dropping his gun as the
police arrived.__ The gun, reg-
istered in his own name, was
loaded with .38 caliber high-
velocity bullets
Virtually all of the small
group of true believers who
have turned the case into a
crusade have never read the
trial record; this makes it
easy to justify siding with a
convicted killer. No one, cer-
tainly not I, would quarrel
with sincere opponents of the

death penalty. Where the-

shrill chorus and I part com-
pany is when it tries to turn a
murderer into a martyr.

Why haven’t the media
pressed the defense to
explain how and why Abu-
Jamal was shot? Howis it
that his gun contained five

spent cartridge cases of the
very caliber and brand of bul-
let that killed Officer
Faulkner? Why did Abu-
Jamal refuse to allow his
brother, an eyewitness, to tes-
tify at the trial? Why didn’t
Abu-Jamal ever deny shoot-
ing Officer Faulkner? The
answers are obvious. He mur-
dered him.

But truth would interfere
with the orchestrated image
that the killer, a self-styled

-prison journalist, is really a

victim. Consider some of the

”The
answers are
obvious. He

murdered
    him."

falsehoods.

-The Fleeing Stranger
Theory.

The Abu-Jamal coterie
claims that several witnesses
saw the “real” shooter
escape. The reality is that
after years of empty asser-
tions, the defense only
recently presented testimony

-from these “witnesses.” Not

one confirms the version put
out by Abu-Jamal’s publi-
cists. Essential parts of their
stories contradict one another
and don’t square with the
physical vestiges of the
crime. The only witnesses
whose testimony agrees with
the known facts came for-
ward immediately after the
crime. The saw Abu-Jamal
kill the policeman.

°The .44 Caliber Bullet
Theory.. '

Abu-Jamal supporters con-
tend he couldn’t be guilty
because Officer Faulkner was
shot with a .44 caliber bullet,

not the .38—caliber bullet
from Abu-Jamal’s gun. This
assertion is based on a hand-
written note on a medical
examiner’s pre—autopsy work-
sheet. But the examiner who
made the notation testified
that he was no weapons
expert and could not precise-
ly measure the bullet. The
real expert who examined the
bullet determined conclusive-
ly that it was a .38 caliber.
That bullet still exists. It had
been made available to the
defense, whose expert refuses
to look at it but concedes that
all the documentation sup-
ports the prosecution’s evi-
dence that the bullet is a’.38.
If the Abu-Jamal legal team
could have disproved the
expert assessment and shown
that the .38 was a .44, it
would have done so.

°The Incompetent
Counsel and Unfair Jury
Theory.

Abu-Jamal supporters say
he was forced to except a
novice lawyer, was given no
money for preparations and
was subjected to the whims
of a racist jury. In fact, he
was represented by an experi-
enced former prosecutor who
was not foisted on him but
took the case at the request of
one of Abu-Jamal’s friends.
The record shows that the
court paid the lawyer, that the
defense received additional
public and private funds and
that the lawyer hired an
investigator who worked on
the case for months before
and during the trial. The jury
was composed of blacks and
whites chosen with Abu-
Jamal’s personal participa-
tion. They voted unanimously
to convict him of first-degree
murder and imposed the
death sentence because he
executed an officer in cold
blood.

uble standards, imperfect people and hypocrisy

A ‘ meri-
 c a n
‘ __ oliti-

 cians deserve
' credit for rep-
resenting the
most hypo-
critical group
of people
anywhere. Theirs is the only job-
which is constantly in the public
eye and whose private lives are
even more heavily scrutinized.
Politicians live like roaches
under a microscope; constantly
pricked and examined for faults,
ﬂaws and personality quirks by
the ever-inquisitive public and
scandal-rninded media.

Rarely, however, do the scien-
tists turn the microscope on
themselves. No one’s halo ﬁts so
perfectly to allow comment on
the size and shape of someone
else’s. Granted, politicians are
ﬂawed animals, but if we’re to
survive as a democracy, then our
politicians must accurately
reﬂect us. And they do.

In our republic, representatives
are elected to represent the pub-
lie in policy decision making.
People who believe in

-The Conspiracy Theory.

Abu-Jamal sympathizers
theorize that any facts that
disprove his claims must be
lies‘ cooked up conspiratorial
band. They claim he was a
famous journalist whom’ the
police framed to silence his
unpopular political views. In
fact, at the time of the murder
he was a high school dropout
who had been fired from his
job and was moonlighting as
a cab driver. The notion that
the police knew who he was
— that they conspired to let
the real killer escape so they
could blame Abu-Jamal — is
ludicrous.

The crime "was committed
at a well-lighted intersection
in full view of numerous peo-
ple. When the police arrived
at the scene almost immedi-
ately after the murder, the
evidence of guilt, both physi-
cal and eyewitness, was there
along with the perpetrator.
There was no reason or
opportunity to fabricate the
pieces of evidence, all of
which collaborated with one
another.

There is no question of
guilt. Yes, this is a troubling
case, but not because the
“system” convicted an inno-
cent man. It is troubling
because it shows how easily
the truth can be lost.

are represented, congressional
districts were redrawn to allow
minorities fairer representation in
Congress. Despite this basic
understanding that politicians are
representative of the electorate,
the public expects more from
politicians than they do from
themselves. Politicians are
expected to represent biblical
characters, rather than Mary lo,
the girl struck by lightning t_l1ree
times near the trailer park in
Mississippi, or Verne, the inbred
steelworker’s son from
Pennsylvania. Politicians are
ﬂawed because Americans are
flawed. It’s a perfect system
that’s tenibly cruel because most
Americans don’t like looking at
corrupt politicians and seeing
themselves.

Senator Packwood is an exam-
ple of a politician scarred by a
hypocritical society. Here’s a
moderate Republican who
stayed away from party politics,
pushed for social reform and got
eaten alive by the public because
he’s been known to, “poll the
electorate,” if you know what I
mean. How’s this man different
from Kennedy, Kennedy, or
Kennedy? Why is the public
hounding him for something
guys do at bars? But, who exact-
ly did Packwood represent? He
was a Senator from the
Northwest; the part of the coun-
try that’s birthplace to grunge

rock. Boy, those grunge rockers
are ethical! These are people
who think a gourmet meal is
picking their left nostril, as
opposed to their right. Packwood
represented his electorate.

The hypocrisy of Americans is
most brutally witnessed during
Presidential races. Poor Gary
Hart. He was the man taking the
1984 Democratic primaries by
storm. He was good-looking,
young and energetic. He was the
man the Democrats wanted to
face President Reagan. They
wanted to demonstrate the clash
in philosophies of two genera-
tions. He was the next Kennedy.
Unfortunately, this was true in
more ways than one. He
preached a policy of “new
ideas,” but much like Kennedy,
he succumbed to one of man’s
oldest ideas, and soon, Hart’s
political career was dead. The
Senator from Colorado, the state
that two years ago decided that
homosexuals don’t deserve equal
rights, was criticized for being
too heterosexual. Go ﬁgure.

The list is endless. Bill Clinton
was criticized for smoking mari-
juana. Suddenly, everyone who
lived in the ‘60s forgot what a
dime bag was. He wasn’t inhal-
ing crack! All he did was experi-
ment with something many
Americans" try. This doesn’t
make it right, or wrong. Yet, the
hypocrisy in politics created an

issue out of this. The myth that
the President must be of divine
origin once again ﬂoated in the
media and electorate. It would
probably come as some surprise
that Bill Clinton is human and
humans are fallible.
Furthermore, it should be noted
that humans are rare in
Arkansas, since many Arkansans
are the result of their fathers get-
ting drunk and running naked
into the barnyard; but that’s
another story and doesn’t reﬂect
the conception of our President.
One ﬁnal example of a politi-
cian lambasted by criticism from
the hypocritical electorate is the
story of Senator Edward
Kennedy. While-he’s survived
politically for years despite his
infamous private life, he’s never
successfully made a serious run
for the presidency. I mean, one
little traffic accident and the guy
is branded for life as a bad dri-
ver. More than 25 years after
Chappaquiddick, Senator
Kennedy is still the victim of
public skepticism and bad jokes.
When Jacqueline Kennedy died,
a joke went something like this:
“What did Rose Kennedy say
when she heard that Jackie
died?” Answer: “Was Ted dri-
ving?” This is the kind of shad-
ow that will haunt Kennedy for
the rest of his life. He’ll go to his
grave remembered as an irre-
sponsible drunk who couldn’t

We just want to be loved, is that so wrong?

s a member of the
Oakland community who
as worked on the “pro-

posals” you mentioned that are
designed to improve the quality
of life in central Oakland, I feel
compelled to respond to your edi-
torial of 9/26/95, “A, Place to Call
Home.”

The editorial troubles me in
many respects. Its nature dis-
plays... a lack of research when
the subject matter demands it.
Clearly, your one source of input
into that editorial was someone’s
gut reaction to reading the Post-
Gazette article on the same sub-
ject A few telephone calls to the
individuals and organizations
involved might have revealed a
deeper, more complex under-
standing of the motivations and
issues involved in attempts to
make Oakland a better place to
live. The harm in writing and
publishing such knee-jerk reac-
tions occurs in that 1) disservice
is done to your readership, a uni-
versity community of this size
deserves better journalism and 2)
division is deepened between the
university and the Oakland com-
munity, between students and
long-term Oakland residents.
This is a wound that needs to
heal, not be driven deeper.

A quick tour of the streets of
central Oakland, (by that I mean
those streets south of Forbes and
east of the Boulevard down to
Schenley Park) reveals the obvi-
ous. The streets that hold greater
proportions of long-tenn Oakland
residents look better, feel safer
and are generally the more pleas-
anter parts of the neighborhood in
which to live. This is not because

students are and nasty peo-
ple, but due to the simple fact that
when you are around a place
awhile, especially if you own a
home there, you are more con-
cemed about the place and taking
care of it and the neighborhood.
The heavy demand for student
housing in Oakland has created a
market for people to make a prof-
it on run-down, ill-maintained,
unsafe and overly priced housing.
This and a whole host of other
problems caused by the presence

I of the university and other

Oakland institutions, and a lack
of enforcement of regulations by
the city, have prevented Oakland
from reaching its potential of
being one of the most desirable
neighborhoods in the city. The
strength of most urban neighbor-
hoods comes from their diversity.
Unfortunately, some of Oakland
has lost this balance. On streets
that have very high concentra-
tions of students in buildings
owned by absentee landlords
rather than long-tenn residents,
the situation has yielded a less
than desirable environment for
either to live in.

So what do we do? A group of
us Oakland residents came up
with some plans and ideas... To
correct an inaccuracy in your edi-
torial, we are not “prominent
Oakland[ers],” . We are ordinary
people of all walks of life, of all
economic levels, of all education-
al backgrounds, from all types of

‘households, juggling work, some

of us child care, to go to these
meetings because we love our
neighborhood, we see its poten-

The point I am getting to here
is our focus as a group is not to
force anyone out of our neighbor-
hood but to improve the quality
of life here. This will be best
achieved and insured when we
get a bit more balance in
Oakland, when we get a few
more people living in Oakland
who are going to stay there a
while. We are trying diverse
strategies hopefully to create con-
ditions that will get us there. We
are not so foolish, as you imply in
your editorial, as to try to recreate
an Oakland that once was. We do
realize, however, that Pitt and
other institutions in Oakland hold

a bounty of people who might"

like to live and own homes in
Oakland if living here could be
made more attractive. In this
quest we don’t need misunder-
standing and misreporting of our
intentions. We don’t need more
mistrust with the students living
in our neighborhood. We need a
realistic perspective that sees us
both, students and long-term
Oakland residents, as common
victims of a crazy housing market
that rewards landlords for junking
up their buildings and our neigh-
borhood.

We may fail. There’s a lot of

negativity around — but if we‘

succeed we’ll have an Oakland
that is stronger, that is cleaner,
that is safer, that is even more
diverse and that would be some-
thing that all of us (long-term res-
idents, the Pitt administration,
graduate students and even Pitt
undergrads) could truly rejoice
about.

drive. His electorate are, of
course, perfect drivers who never
once spent an evening in front of
the toilet ﬁnding religion.

The public will always use
double standards concerning
politicians. Quayle will always
be considered an idiot by the
geniuses in Indiana, and
Kennedy will always be a drunk
in the state where Kitty Dukakis
once drank a bottle of rubbing

alcohol and was disappointed

when there was no olive on the
bottom. We must remember that
we’re not a perfect society, and
therefore our representatives are
not perfect. Our elected officials
are beer—bellied, racist idiots who
lie, drink,‘do drugs, drive under
the inﬂuence and have sex with
minors, or animals. They’re
black, yellow, green, red, white
and blue. Some steal money, and
others steal votes. They’re
thieves and convicted felons.
Some believe in the Warren
Commission and some served on
it. They certainly aren’t perfect
people and shouldn’t be expect-
ed to serve as such. They should
be expected to act and behave
exactly like us. They should
reﬂect the mood and attitude of
their electorate. We’re not a per-
fect people, and therefore our
representatives need only be as
good as ourselves.

Bikes take

Bicyclists in Pittsburgh
have been pushed to the side
of the road for way. too long.
We are not allowed to ride on
the sidewalk, so we risk our
livesevery day competing
with trucks and cars. The
time has come for bicyclists
to take a stand and let cars
know that we are traffic too.
Millions are spent every year
to expand and improve
Pittsburgh’s road system.
Why are there no bike lanes?
Why is my tax money used
to support a wasteful and
unnecessary means of trans-
portation in the city? Why
must I risk my life to get to
school? —

On Oct. 20 at 3 p.m., the
Student Environmental
Action Coalition‘ of the
University of Pittsburgh will
be sponsoring a Critical
Mass Bike Ride. We will be
meeting on Meade Street,
near the corner of Penn and
Braddock. The ride will pro-
ceed through the streets of
Pittsburgh, drawing attention
to the fact that there are no
bike lanes for us to ride in so
we must take to -the streets,
blocking all traffic behind us
if necessary. All are welcome
to join us, and commuters are
strongly encouraged to use a
bike or mass transit that day
(and always), as it is very
possible there will be traffic
jams due to the ride.

Dictionary,” frustration is
deﬁned as the act of frustrating.
This deﬁnition doesn’t make
much sense to me — I think the
real meaning of frustration is
being a Pitt Panther football fan.
After last Saturday's 26-16
frustrating loss to Virginia Tech,
frustration is running high with
the players, coaches and fans.
What can be more frustrating
than watching two Pitt punts get
blocked in the third quarter with
the Panthers still winning the

a game? I don’t know, maybe

seeing two more blocked punts.
After last week’s block against
Ohio State, I bet Nate Cochran
is pretty frustrated, too.

What can be more frustrating
than watching a certain Pitt cor-
nerback give up an 85-yard
reception when the Hokies had
a third—and— 10 from the ﬁve-
inch line? At least the play
didn’t go for a 99-yard, 2-feet- '
7-inch touchdown. I bet that
comerback is pretty frustrated.

What can be more frustrating
than to see two of the best run-
ners in the Big East go down
with injuries? With Billy West’s
fractured ankle and Demetrius
Harris’ gimpy right foot, at least
we can be thankful that players
like Dietrich J ells and Denorse
Mosely didn’t get hurt. Oh wait
a minute, they were injured as
well. I bet that was pretty frus-
trating for the training staff and
those respective players.

What can be more frustrating
than seeing 83 reverses and
draw plays on third-and-15?
Now, I’ll be the first to admit, a
few of these plays worked for a
while, especially when West
and Jells were still in the game,
but I bet that judging from the
boos that echoed throughout the
stadium, the fans were pretty
frustrated at the coaching staff
and the lack of second half exe-
cution.

What can be more frustrating
than to watch a quarterback go
16-for-41 when he didn’t throw
a single pass over 25 yards? I
know what’s more frustrating,
when Pitt was down 10 and on
their last drive, it was awful
frustrating to watch that quarter-
back throw the ball away on a
fourth-and-10. I bet the
receivers were frustrated on that
one. ,

than to watch the offensive line

Hokies block

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

All the signs were there. The Panthers’ '

main offensive cog, Billy West, and the
defense’s staple in the secondary, Denorse
Mosley, both returned from their respective
injuries. .
Virginia Tech appeared ﬂat after coming

off last week’s huge win against Miami, and ‘-

Pitt was moving the ball withauthority in
the first half. The Panthers were in a perfect

position to win their ﬁrst Big East game and

end their two-game losing streak.

Instead, Pitt (2-3) squandered its prime
opportunity by giving up big play after big
play as Virginia Tech (2-2) downed the
Panthers 26-16 in its Big East opener
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. .

“That was one of the most disappointin
losses I’ve ever been around, and certainly
one of the most disappointing losses in a
long, long time,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said. ,

On top of Pitt’s colossal disappointment,
the Panthers also lost a handful of key play-
ers. West, after rushing for 113 yards in
two-and-a-half quarters, went down again
— this time with a broken leg — and will
miss the rest of the season. Demetrius
Harris, who has ﬁlled in admirably for West
the last three games, sustained a sprained
right toe. The severity of the injury is not
known. Also; Pitt’s top receiver, Dietrich
Jells, left the game because of an ankle
injury. Furthermore, Mosley sprained his
right thumb.

Most of these injuries happened in the

second half, which, judging by the momen-

tum of the game, was quite apparent.

“From my observation, we were whip-
ping them quite as well as they could be
whipped in the first half, except on the
scoreboard,” Majors said.

The Panthers dominated the ﬁrst half, as.

they held the Hokies to only 114 total yards
and a mere 16 yards rushing. But Pitt’s

domination wasn’t that noticeable by the
score. Pitt held a 9-0 lead going into the
locker room.

The momentum immediately swung to
Pitt’s side to start the game. On Virginia
Tech’s first possession, linebacker David
Sumner intercepted Jim Druckenmiller’s
errant pass and returned it to Pitt’s 42-yard
line. Sumner’s 16-yard interception run
would have been much greater, but
Anthony Dorsett Jr. accidently tackled
Sumner trying to throw a block. Perhaps it
was a little foreshadowing of things to

come.
Pitt did nothing with its opportunity and

r was forced to punt. After another defensive

stop, the Panthers, with good ﬁeld position
again, decided to utilize West. After three
straight plays to West, quarterback John
Ryan hit his favorite target, Jells, for a 6-
yard gainer and a first down. Down on
Virginia Tech’s 18-yard line, Pitt started to
self—destruct. After a holding penalty and a
futile shotgun draw play, the Panthers were
now looking at a third-and-12 situation.

against cross-town rivals, Duquesne.

By Matt Townsend
For The Pitt News

The women’s volleyball team raced to a

lead and never looked back, thrashing‘

Duquesne 15-9, 15-6, 15-2 last.Saturday
night.

Pitt jumped to a 5-0 lead in the first game
behind the serving of Sarah Mikla. The lead
was 8-2 when outside’ hitter Annemarie
Tarara came to serve and increased the lead to
12-2. Her" mixture of line drives‘and well-
placed serves had Duquesne reeling. After
Duquesne came back to make it 14-9, Pitt
then ended the game at '15-9.

In the second game the score was 4-3 when
Sarah Mikla served and pushed the advantage

to 8-3. After that streak of points, Pitt coasted
to a 15-6 win. 1

After many sideouts in the third game, Pitt
played strong behind Sara Mitchell’s four
kills, going on to whip Duquesne 15-2, end-_
ing the match.

“This team has a history of starting off
strong and then fading, but tonight we got
stronger as the match went on,” said head
coach Cindy Alvear. “This wasn’t our best
match of the year, but I’m still pleased with
the way we played tonight.” " ' “

Freshman Tara Haefner played in her first
game at setter and made 38 sets, 8 digs and 4
kills. '

Offense falls flat in the
redzone against Tech

By Kevin Lilley

For The Pitt News

Pitt Panther bowl quest 1995 hit an early-season snag
Saturday with a 26-16 loss to Virginia Tech in the squad’s Big
East opener.

The goat was the Pitt offense, which couldn’t find the end
zone with a map for most of the game, earning three instead of
seven on three consecutive drives, as they fell flat inside the
20. .

The red zone. The blue zone. Call it whatevervyou want, but
inside it, the Panthers could not move the football anywhere
but backward.

Pitt cracked the red zone midway through the first quarter
with a first and 10 on the Tech 18. Sadiq Durham carried for
five yards on the play, but the net gain was five in the opposite

— direction after the third of sevenPitt line penalties. A Billy

West run and a delay to Demetrius Harris netted a combined
three «yards, setting up a John Ryan incompletion and the first
of three Chris Ferencik field goals. « .

On the next possession, the Pitt drive stalled even before
reaching the 20. With afirst down on the Tech 25, Harris was
stopped for a short gain, Ryan threw an incompletion and in
one of many questionable play calls on the afternoon, Harris
was stopped cold on a third and 8 tailback dive. Ferencik’s
second field goal gave Pitt a 6-0 lead.

Pitt’s next possession was its longest of the afternoon, taking
15 plays, 75 yards and nearly half of the second quarter. It
came to crunch time with a first down at the Virginia Tech 12,
and two Harris carries put Pitt right at the door with a third
and 5 on the Tech 7. But a reverse call lost seven, and the
Panthers had to settle for another field goal and a 9-0 lead at
the half. .

At the half, Pitt was dominating in all areas but the score-

board. Tech had l6 rushing yards. Billy" West had 88. Virginia .

Tech had only five first downs.

Head coach Johnny Majors said, “We were whipping them
about as well as they can be whipped.”

John Ryan added, “We controlled the ball the whole first
half.”

But after what Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said was
an “emotional halftime,” Pitt came out and allowed a touch-
down after a punt block on their first series of the third quarter.

Title IX claims men's tennis a

By Nichole Gantshar
For The Pitt News

(Editor's Note: This is the first ofa
four-part series about Title IX and
why the University of Pittsburgh
dropped men ’s tennis and gymnas-
tics, while adding women’s soccer.)

Men’s tennis and men’s gymnas-

tics no longer exist at the University ‘

of Pittsburgh.

The Department of Education’s
Office of Civil Rights previously
had the university under investiga-
tion, and on May 2, 1995, Pitt’s
Athletic Department told the ath-
letes their teams were being cut due
to NCAA regulations and Title IX.
In response to the the OCR investi-
gation, the athletic department
announced plans to add a women’s
varsity’ soccer team.

“I think it’s great we’ve added
soccer,” former tennis player David
Dumple, said.

He also wondered, “why did they
have to cut the men’s teams to cre-
ate opportunities for women?”

Were the teams cut as a response
to the OCR investigation? Does
Title IX require that Athletic
Departments cut men’s teams to
establish gender equity? The law
states, “no person in the United
States shall, on the basis of sex, be
excluded from participation in 
any program.”

The law calls for schools to pro-
vide equal opportunities for women.
It does not mandate how those
opportunities should exist.

“One of the most popular ways to
achieve gender equity has become
cutting men’s non-revenue produc-
ing sports like gymnastics and
swimming and blaming women’s
sports in the name of Title IX,” said
Donna Lopiano of the Women’s
Sports Foundation.

Was cutting the two men’s sports
totally a title IX decision?

“No.” Carol

debates that occurred prior to Title
IX’s passage,” Lopiano said.

In 1974 as the implications for
sports became clear, Senator John
Tower (R-Texas) introduced an
amendment that proposed to exempt
sports from Title IX’s protection.
The NCAA supported this amend-
ment. When the amendment failed
to pass, Congress enacted a compro-
mise that stated

ciate athletic director,
said. “You reach a

point where you have barely mentioned in the

ball created a dis-

series of education-
related amendments to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964‘. It took
Congress until 1972 to pass the leg-

. islation.

Every time Congress passes a new

law, the federal agency responsible

for the law writes rules to imple-
ment the law. In most situations.
The public then has 30 days to com-
ment on the rules, but for Title IX
there was a public comment period
of four months. It took seven years
to write and approve the rules for
Title IX. _

“Ironically, sports were barely
mentioned in the congressional

turbing situation for campus admin-
istrators.

Sports will never be equal “as
long as you have football in the
equation,” Frank D’Amico, the for-
mer men’s gymnastics coach, said.

It has become so difficult for cam-
puses with football teams to create
equal opportunities for women ath-
letes that the NCAA needed to cre-
ate special rules.

“You need at least six varsity

teams to compete in Division I” said
Oval Jaynes, Pitt athletic director.

for men [to make up for football].”

Sixteen years of court decisions
constructed a case law that now dic-
tates how the NCAA and member
universities interpret Title IX. The
case law, with its accompanying
penalties, provides the mechanisms
to enforce the law.

Title IX applies to all aspects of
education — access to buildings,
classes, university resources and
athletics. If school do not comply,
they can not receive federal funds
from the government.

In 1984 Grove City College, a
small private school north of
Pittsburgh, sued the government
over Title IX. The college argued
that since only the financial aid
office received federal funds that
only the financial aid office ‘was
under the purview of Title IX.
Grove City won, and so did several
other organizations that sued over
other civil rights laws. The legal
decisions mobilized the civil rights
community.

One of the most active voices in
the fight to overturn the Grove City
decision was the women’s sports
community. Olympic athletes and
current champions rallied and spoke
out nationally in defense of Title IX.

Again, the debate took years.
Partisan battles waged in Congress
from 1984 until 1988, when
President Reagan signed the bill that
restored the law to its pre—l984 sta-
tus. More court suits prompted new
legislation, and a 1991 law resolved
more issues of equal opportunity.

4 What can be more frustrating
than watching your team punt
on third down? This might have
been great strategy, since Pitt
couldn’t get a punt off to save
the newly renovated players’
facilities, but punting on third
down sucks. It shows no conﬁ-
dence in the offense or the punt-
ing team, and coupled with the
fact that the punt sailed into the
end zone and Tech scored on the
ensuing drive, I bet that the
coaching staff and John Ryan
were pretty frustrated.

What can be more frustrating
than going to another game and
sitting through another tease?
The fans are sick and tired of
watching the Panthers titillate
the crowd for 40 minutes or so,
then completely collapse. Over
the last four years this has hap-
pened far too many times.
Come the time the next home
game rolls around against
Miami, I think that the low
attendance will show the coach-
ing staff and the players just
how frustrated the fans have
become.

Mike Kovak is a columnist for
The Pitt News and is a pretty
frustrated individual.

“We had to make some
adjustments because of not
having our starting setter, and
the team responded well. The
adjustment was one of the
keys to us blowing them
out,” said Alvear. “It was
Tara’s first collegiate game,
which can be intimidating,
and she was poised and had a
great game.” .

Another freshmen, Jessica
Van Der Mallie, added a
spark off the bench with 10
digs and a team-leading .667
kill percentage. She also hit a
hard serve on match point.

“Jessica played all over the
court tonight. She only had
three swings, and she hit two
of them, so I was very happy
with her play. She came off
the bench and responded to
the challenge,” said Alvear.

Middle hitter ' Jennie
Driscoll led the team in kills
with 10 in 17 attempts and
was second in digs with 11.
She also had the only solo
block, coming in the third
game, which pushed the lead
to 11-1.

“Driscoll is always there,”
said Alvear. “We can always
count her to play well. S_he’s
so reliable that she doesn’t
get all the credit that she
deserves.”

Sara Mitchell, a senior out-
side hitter, led the team in
digs with 12 and was second
in kills with nine. The lefty
put two kills down late in the
third game to make the score
14-2. She dove and lunged
onto the court for many of

. her digs, keeping points alive
that were eventually won by
Pitt.

“I’m really excited for
Sarah. She is having a
tremendous senior year and is
getting better with each
game,” said Alvear. “She’s
another player that is always
there.”

By winning, Pitt evened its
record at 7-7.

“At this point in the year,
I'm not worried about how
many wins we have. Right
now I’m getting my team
ready to compete in the Big
East,” said Alvear. “This
team is half freshmen, and I
want them to get all the expe-
rience they can, so I sched-
uled hard early in the season,
so when we enter Big East
play we have already played
teams at that level.”

The team looks ahead tp

Forced to throw, Ryan spotted a
semi-open Jells in the end zone,
but JeHs dropped the ball as two
defensemen immediately con-
verged.

Consequently, freshman kick-
er Chris Ferencik booted a 37-
yard ﬁeld goal to give Pitt a 3-0
lead. Ferencik would go on to
kick two other first half field
goals.

Pitt had the Hokies reeling
going into halftime.

“Pittsburgh had us on our
heels. We felt like we weren’t
playing that great, but Pitt had
something to do with that,”
Hokie coach Frank Beamer
said. “It was an emotional half-
time. But what happened after
the halftime is what I’m really
impressed with.”

Reminiscent of last week’s
Ohio State game, Pitt crumbled
in the second half.

After afalse start penalty
killed an impressive drive, the
Panthers were forced to punt.
Before punter Nate Cochran
could blink, freshman Angelo
Harrison burst through the right
side of the line and blocked the
punt. Later Harrison would
block another punt. Tech has
already blocked six kicks this

- year. .

The Hokies got the ball at
Pitt’s 30-yard line, and three
plays later Tech scored a touch-
down when running back

jogged 15 yards to the end zone.
With 10:14 left in the third
quarter, Tech cut Pitt’s lead to 9-
7, and more importantly, the
momentum began to shift.

“The whole story, to me, is
our punt blocking was atro-
cious,” Majors said. “Without
the punt blocks, we still had an
extremely good chance of win-
ning the ball game.”

On Pitt’s third possession of
the half, the Panthers rebound-
ed, as they drove 80 yards down
field for a touchdown. But with-
out question, it was the most
costly touchdown Pitt will see
in a long time.

The second play of the drive,
West went down after a 2-yard
run. This was West’s ﬁrst game
back since he separated his
shoulder in theﬁrst game of the
year.

“Everybody was happy we
had Billy back, and when he
went down, you could kind of
see the team like, ‘Wow, Billy
went down,”’ wide receiver
Mark Butler said.

“It’s a huge loss,” Majors
said. “He’s a terrific football
player, he just had a wasted
junior year, which isn’t any
fault of his own.”

The following play, Jells left
the game after he presumably
twisted his ankle. Now, without
Ryan’s two favorite weapons,
he would have to look else-
where, and he did. The next
play Ryan ﬁred a perfect strike

the next play, Druckenmiller
found a wide open Jermaine
Holmes down the middle for a
73-yard touchdown strike. With
10:42 remaining in the game,
Pitt now trailed 20-16, and it
appeared that Pitt’s hopes were
all but over.

“We played well, but we let
the big plays hurt us,” said
Tumulty. “We had opportuni-
ties,«but we didn’t take advan-
tage _of them.”

Pitt’s subsequent possession,
the Hokies forced the Panthers
to punt again. But this time,
Cochran launched a beauty and
Curtis Anderson downed it at

to Butler. With a lot of green in
front of him, Butler dashed
across midfield, and Sadiq
Durham laid a perfect block,
enabling Butler to get to Tech’s
17-yard line. Seven plays later,
Chris Schneider plunged 2
yards for the touchdown, giving
Pitt a 16-7 lead. This was the
first touchdown Virginia Tech

Because of the Panthers’
ineptness at punting, Majors
decided to punt on third down
on Pitt’s ensuing possession.
The punt sailed" into the end
zone, which gave Tech the ball
at its own 20-yard line.

“I didn’t want to take a
chance that time,” Majors said.
“I didn’t want to take a chance
of another punt to get blocked.”

After a Tom Tumulty sack,
the Hokies were faced with a
second-and-16 situation. But

Druckenmiller dropped back in
the end zone and lofted the ball
to speedy Bryan Still. Still beat
Dorsett in a foot race and ran
for an 85-yard gain. Pitt held
the Hokies to a field goal, but
that would be all the struggling
Panthers could take, as they
trailed 26-16 with 3:00 remain-
ing in the game.

“We really controlled the
whole first half,” said Ryan,

passes for 207 yards and an
interception. “It’s kind of a

Title IX

°From page 9

The aspects of Title IX were the least controversial
aspects of the civil rights restoration legislation. So despite
the questions raised by the Grove City decision, athletes
and universities still brought more court suits.

Most recently in March of 1995, a high court decision in
a case involving Brown University grabbed the attention of
athletic directors across the country.

The courts found Brown in violation of Title IX because
proportionally, the university does not offer equal opportu-
nities to its female athletes. Brown University is appealing
the decision.

Explaining the impact of the Brown case, Jaynes said the
decision places increased emphasis on proportionality.

“There are 13 conditions in Title IX, but in the rules
established in 1979 there are three tests defined by the
Office of Civil Rights,” Jaynes said.

Until the decision to cancel men’s gymnastics and men’s
tennis, Pitt had ll teams for men and eight teams for
women.

While proportionality was the most important condition,
the law also asked campuses to survey their campus and
determine how they were meeting the needs of their stu-
dents.

Before the Brown decision, the third category to judge
Title IX compliance was the historical development of
sports programs. In the past, “if you can demonstrate that
over a period of time you have added programs,” Jaynes
said, then an athletic director could safely judge that his or
her university would be in compliance.

The lawsuit developed from Brown cutting two men’s
teams (golf and water polo) and two women’s teams (vol-
leyball and gymnastics). Since 51 percent of Brown’s popu-
lation but only 40 percent of athletes are female, the court
ruled against Brown and continued the battle over the inter-
pretation of Title IX.

Currently there are three outstanding law suits concerning
Title IX. Louisiana State faces a class action suit filed in
march of 1994 to add two sports. University of Bridgeport
in Connecticut faces a pending class action suit to reinstate
women’s gymnastics. Locally, the Indiana University of
Pennsylvania awaits a decision regarding a 1992 suit to
reinstate women’s gymnastics and field hockey.

These lawsuits show that universities will struggle to
interpret Title IX. Nothing in Title IX requires cutting
opportunities for men, but finances have made it a pattern
across the country.

Soccer

°From page 8

elapsed, the Pitt bench emptied out onto the
field to celebrate the victory.

“The win felt great because we should have
won on Friday,” Piombino said. Pitt definitely
made up for the loss. A

“We out-played and out-hustled them. We
deserved to win this game, and the results
showed it,” Piombino said.

“Unbelievable,” said junior forward Matt
Schell of the win. “We haven’t scored on them
in three years.”

Assistant coach Chris Karwoski credited the
win to desire by the players.

“The guys had more desire today,” Karwoski

said. “They have enough desire and soccer
ability to beat any team in the country.”

Pitt put together another good team
effort and scored the goals when they needed
to.

“Travis had a big game,” Karwoski said. “We
had freshman players in there most of the
game. They played well._”

Pitt did get a break by getting the call to
grant them a penalty shot, but Karwoski said
they would have won anyway.

“We played well enough to tie,” Karwoski
said. “If the game would have went into over-
time, I think we would have won.”

Pitt posted seven shots on goal, and Spitzer
had an impressive 10 saves to secure the win.

“With the victory today, we proved to our-
selves we could beat anyone,” Schell said.

The Panthers were not so optimistic after
their 1-0 loss Friday to Boston College, now
3-0 in the Big East. The only goal of the game
was scored by Boston College midfielder Paul
Keegan on an assist by sophomore Anthony
Buckley.

Scoring and second half play once gain
haunted the Panthers.

“Finishing is a problem,” Karwoski said.

The Panthers pulled it together on Sunday, as
they played a full game versus the Red Storm.

The Panthers travel to Syracuse to take on
the Orangemen this Sunday, Oct. 8, at l p.m.

Offense

 

‘From page 9

The Pitt touchdown drive that fol-
lowed was the only positive perfor-
mance the Panthers could manage
inside the red zone, but they got
some help from Tech when they
needed it most. With a goal-to-go at
the Tech 6, Harris ran for 1 yard,
and Ryan threw an incompletion.
Another field goal attempt could
have been forthcoming, but a pass
interference call gave Pitt a fresh
start at the two, where Chris
Schneider bulled his way into the
end zone for the touchdown.

After that score, Pitt never again
saw the red zone. Just like the indi-

vidual drives stalled near their fin-
ish, the entire offense stalled near
the end of the game, resulting in a
26-16 defeat and a.0-1 Big East
record.

Coach Majors called it “one of the
most disappointing losses I’ve ever
been around.” _

Ryan simply said, “We shot our-
selves in the foot.”

“Our players came back out and
beat a good football team,” said
Beamer.

Pick your own sound bite, but the
Panthers fell short in the second half
of their drives and the second half of
the game last Saturday.
