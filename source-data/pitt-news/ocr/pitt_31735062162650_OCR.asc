Peake Says

Dr. Charles Peake, vice
chancellor for the academic
disciplines, has announced
that plans are under way for
an expanded and more ﬂexible

program for the department
of modern languages. '

V‘ Discussing the reorganization,
Dr. Peake said, "The foreign lan-
guages and literatures program at
the university- should ‘show con-
siderable growth during the com-
ing years, in keeping with the
development of the College of the
_Academic Disciplines in genera
and the Division of Humanities in
particular." I

Dr. Peake..,_outlined the. five-
point reorganization plan which
is alreadyin effect.

1. The name of the depart-
ment will be the department of
modern languages and litera-
tures, so that the larger human-

’ istic concerns of the department
‘may be reflected. ‘

2. The department will consist
of four sections: romance lan-
guages and literatures; Germanic
languages and literatures; Slavic
languages and literatures; Far
Eastern languages and literatures.

3. Each section will have a
chairman, and under‘ his direction
will develop its own program, de-
termine its materials and methods.

Preregistration,

Underway For

Upperclassmen

P1'eregist1‘ation is -now under
way in many divisions of the uni-
versity. Studentsin "the schools of
Liberal Arts, Education, Business

' Administration and Nursing have

been meeting with their advisers
since Oct. 19. A

However, preregistration of up-
perclass students in the Liberal
Artspschool has been lower than
anticipated. .

It is very important that all stu-
dents have their courses elected
for curriculum and schedule plan-
ning as soon as possible. Any stu-
dent who has not had an appoint-
ment with his adviser should ar-
range a conference now. ‘Persons
in the‘ above mentioned schools

.will not be admitted to the formal

registration for the Winter Tri-
mester between January 2 and ,5,
1960. A
Each student should meet
with his adviser at the sched-
uled time. Cancellations will be
accepted due to the limited time
schedule of the faculty members.
At the conference, the student
and adviser completes the
Course Election Report form, to
later be used as the basis for
‘the student’s schedule.-

Upperclassmen in the School of
Liberal Arts must meet with their
adviser to complete the Course
Election Report. The white sched-
ule card which some students
completed last spring does not con-
stitute a preregistration.

The faculty and administration
have instituted many changes in
the preregistration program in or-
der to make the task easier for
both students and faculty. Oﬁi-
cials say that cooperation during
the initial phases of the new pro-

’ Leich Conducts Performance

Of Mendelssohn Choral Work

The American premiere performance of a newly redis-9

covered choral work by Felix

Mendelssohn will be present-

ed at the Carnegie Music Hall next Tuesday by the Men-
delssohn Choir of Pittsburgh, Roland Leich conducting. This
recently recovered manuscript gives a musical setting to a
poem by the German poet, Schiller.

Pittsburgh will be the ﬁrst¢

American city to hear this work
because of the interest and enter-
prise of Mrs. Charlotte Ludwig
of the university’s modern lan-
guage department and the Office
of Cultural and Educational Ex-
change.

Mrs. Ludwig, a German instruc-
tor, in preparing for the 200th
anniversary of Schiller’s birth,
learned of the existence of an
unpublished Mendelssohn-Schiller
manuscript.

She asked the Oﬁice of Cul-
tural and Educational Exchange
to try to locate it for the anni-
versary commemoration. It is
also the—-— 150th anniversary of
Mendelssohn’s birth.

Following Mrs. Ludwig’s re-

' quest, after a long and involved

correspondence with the Schiller
Museum and the Mendelssohn
heirs, the office obtained, not only
the manuscript, but permission to
reprint it and use it for a per-
formance. .

The Mendelssohn Choir was

asked to give the American pre—_

miere performance and included
the work, “Die Frausen und der
Saenger,”- in the program of its
51st Annual Fall Concert.
Another premiere featured in
this program will be the ﬁrst
performance of -“The Three
Rivers” by T. Carl Whitmer,
which was specially commis-
sioned for the Pittsburgh Bicen-
tennial by Mrs. A. S. F. Kiester.
Mrs. Kiester, a pupil of Dr.
Whitemer, is a member of the
Mendelssohn Choir Board.

Based Affair  

The problem of Spring Festival has been settled. In a

 

-surprising 16-0 vote on Monday, Student Government Assn.

wiped the traditional event off the university calendar.
We say the vote was surprising, not because it abolish-
ed Carnival but because it was so overwhelmingly one-
sided. The same holds true for the amount of discussion on
the proposal. Only a few representatives bothered to say
any thing at all about the matter. '
The behavior of the SGA members might be interpreted

in two ways. First, it is possibleithat Spring Festival had

reached a point where it was held in such low esteem by
the student body that the representatives cared little about
its fate. The tipoff here might have been seen in the ex-
tremely low attendance at the meeting on Sept.‘ 20 when
all university students were given an opportunity to dis-
cuss the future of. Carnival.

SGA might have decided that as long as the student
body was uninterested, there was no need to ‘continue the
event. , '

On the other hand, the vote could be the result of real-
istic thinking. In this case, the members recognized that
permitting Carnival to continue in its present form was
next to impossible, There would be little chance to get the
event off the ground in the Spring trimester.

Although both of these ideas undoubtedly contributed '

to the outcome of the vote, we would venture to say the lat-
ter prevailed as the greaterinﬂuence. V
Whatever the reason for the vote, SGA acted wisely.

" The problems compounded bythe trimester system to Car-

nival have been mentioned many times previously. Per-
haps the most pressing complaint—-one that apparently has

_ picked up backers recently—is that Festival as‘ it has been

presented was too limited in its attraction for various seg-
ments of the university. _

Although this “problem has nothing to do with the
Spring trimester, it nevertheless had to be considered. In

fact, it just might well be the point that should receive the .

most serious consideration from those students who have
been handed the task of ﬁnding an acceptable replacement
for the May affair.

The more intelligent suggestions for Carnival’s succes-

sor mostly have included an event on a smaller scale. Such
a plan, it is felt, would enable groups or individuals other
than those connected with Greek organizations, to partici-
pate. n - _
Attempts have_ been made in the past to include such
groups as the female resident students in Carnival. Unfor-
tunately, for various reasons, these attempts never have
been successful. A festival with smaller ideas could ’very
well include the resident ‘students or any other non-Greek
group. . . ' p , ’
Or maybe the best solution lies in a university-wide
event which would offer students a chance to participate as
individuals rather than as parts of a’ group. A
Realistically, however, the solution lies with the*stu-
dents themselves, The majority of them may very well op-

pose any type of festival whatsoever. If this is true, SGA '

should recognize it and wisely drop the whole matter. But
if the interest remains, let something be done about it. And
let that something be acceptable to the greater number, not
the lesser as it has been in the past. '

Subject of Education . . .

 

A Reasonable Approach 

By Ina Amdur

When one summarizes a speech, he may do it
a serviceor a disservice. If the original speech is
poor, a summary may camouﬂage its weakness by
condensing it. If the original speech is good a
summary must inevitably ex-
clude the nuances.of the speaker
and the subtleties of his speech.

Brand Blanshard, chairman of
the philosophy,/ department at
Yale, delivered the Pitcairn-
Crabbe lecture at Stephen Foster
last Thursday night. His was a
speech to which a summary can-
not do justice. However, what he
said is of such great import that
an inadequate summary is better
than none at all. ./

Blanshard spoke on “What Is Education For?”
Immediately he stated that the purpose of educa-
tion is_ to produce reasonable minds. It is not to
hand one knowledge, or to effect one’s adjustment
in the community, but to produce habits‘ and dis-
positions. These habits should be reﬂected in rea-
sonableness of belief, reasonableness of feeling, and
reasonableness of action. ' ’

r‘Three Point AH-iiude j -

The habit of reasonableness in belief manifests
itself when one maintains .the attitude of_skepti-
cism, reﬂectiveness and impersonalthinking. Skep-
ticism prevents one from accepting the status" quo
and causes one to ask why. Reﬂectiveness, and
here Blanshard uses the language of John Dewey,

requires one to consider events in the light of ante- ‘

cedents and consequences. , .
He has grave doubts about the reﬂectiveness of
a generation whose main ‘comfort is a -television set.
Thinking impersonally is contrasted to "thinking
with one’s blood. It involves intellectual honor
and the adherence to “fastidiousness of mind,”

“scrupulousness about truth,” and a “prejudice ‘
Insanity, which» according to-

against prejudice.”
Blanshard is the latest idol of the lostlgeneration,
is a “dark deformity of spirit” and is not ‘to be
prized.. For genius "can exist without complete
irrationality. '

Reasonableness in feeling consists of adjusting
one’s feeling to its object. Blanshard severly criti-

  Letters To The Editor

 

cized modern art forms for_ departing from this
reasonableness in feeling. Modern music manifests
“prirnitivism” and abstract painting presents a
“concentration on the meaningless.”
Worth. the Object

Modern art forms have no standards and for
this -reason the work of chimpanzees have won art

—prizes and stock reports written in blank verse

have been considered poetry. Feeling for its own,
sake is not valuable, unless it is a reasonable feel
ing attached to a worthy object. ~{.
Reasonableness also manifests itself in action.
Reasonable action always implies a balance of con-
trol. Even love and hope must be in accordance
with reason. Rationality in behavior is much more
interesting and admirable, to Blanshard than the
“tempestuousness” of a Maria Callas.

Colleges were not instituted to train one’s action
in the" “wisdom of sexes” but in Platonic wisdom.
Both reasonable ‘means and reasonable goals are
required for reasonable action. This kind of action
is not eclipsed by cultural differences. Reasonable
men in China, Americaor Russia, despite the many
social barriers, ‘can meet on the common ground _of.
reason. A’ _ ' '.
Reasonableness Basie ,

For Blanshard, the “glorysof man is that he can
think.” Aristotle has claimed that man is a rational

"animal and it is to the “furtherance of this claim

that education must direct its efforts. Blanshard
concluded his speech with the plea to be‘ reason-
able, without which attempt everything else is im-
possible. The epitaph which should be considered
the most desirable is expressed in the simple sen-
tence, “Here was a reasonable man.” . "
Blanshard’s views were enhanced by his manner
of presenting them. One can ‘see _that he is gently
cynical, andthis quality is not hidden when he
speaks. His speech was interspersedxwith humor

most of which was provocatively ‘funny. His plea ‘
‘for reasonableness in thought, feeling and action_ _

must be heeded, by those‘ in our universities and
outside them who would quell the use of reason
and the search for truth. - —

In Blanshard’s words, “The glory of man is that

he can think.” One knows that he can, but one

only wonders if~he,will, and hopes that,‘it« will not .

be too ‘late. when he starts‘ to.

Freedom Does Exist,

Asserts Professor

Editor the Pitt News:
Ordinarily it is probably bet-

. ' ter for the faculty to stay out of

students discussions, but two re-
cent letters to the Pitt News are
so wide of the mark that I feel
that some comment is in order.

One letter referred to “this to-
talitarian university.” Another
refers to the ‘authoritarian at-
titude of the "present administra-
tion” and states that “many fac-
ulty members are suffering from
the same administration dicta-
torship, but are afraid to speak
because they would certainly.
lose their jo .” ’

“I do not doubt that the writ- -

ers of the letters are sincere, and
their concern for freedom is
commendable. But they are mis-
informed. If they knew some-
thing of the history of academic
freedom "and student liberties in
the university, they would real-
ize that the advances made in
‘this ﬁeld by the present admin-
istration are among the very
ﬁnest things the administration
has. done. .
There was a time in the ‘thir-
ties’ when the faculty was
afraid, when teachers did lose

their jobs because of their views -

and when the university, as a
result, was blacklisted by the
American Ass’n. of University
Professors. A

Those days are gone. As late
as the early ‘fifties,’ student or-
ganizations were not permitted
on campus if they were affiliat-
ed with any national group. For
example, a student chapter of
the World Federalists organiza-
tion was barred from campus.
Even the Young Democrats and
Young ‘Republicans were permit-
ted to organize only once every

    

What is the. atmosphere ‘now?
Only last year, the YWCA- and

YMCA invited a communist to’

speak on campus. He represent-
ed about the most unpopular

viewpoint in the country- Never-'
theless, the administration did

not interfere in any way, on the

very sound theory that students
should have the opportunity to

hear every point of view for

themselves. . A

V Do you think there was ‘no
community pressure on the uni-
versity to interfere? The admin-
istration behaved properly and
courageously; Let us take an-
other example. The Student
Government Ass’n. now has the
right to recognize or not recog-
nize student- organizations. Last
year SGA extended recognition.
to a student chapter of the
NAACP. “ I

_I know. that there were some‘

high administration officials who
felt that the NAACP should not
be recognized, but the matter
was left entirely to the SGA.
Does the faculty fear to criticize
the administraiton? Perhaps
some do. Personally, I have crit-
icized the administration in class
_and publicly when I thought. it

‘was wrong, and literally hund-

reds of students now on campus
have heard medo so.

No one has ever put any pres-
sure on me, and I_ do not "expect
anyone to ,do so in the future.
So far a_s,I know, most of my

colleagues feel the same way, . 5

and they are better. teachers for
it. And students will get a bet-

ter education for being .allowed,.

as they now are, to make their
own mistakes, so long as they
do not burn down the Cathedral.

I think the vast majority of
students know this. If this were
really a 'f‘t_otalitarian university”
would students be signing .their
names to critical letters? .Would

‘the Pitt News be criticizing the

administration (sometimes quite
justly) in every other issue?
Pitt is not yet a great uni-
versity, but is‘ has already
achieved one of the most prec-
ious hallmarks of all the great

universities —- an atmosphere of j

"freedomof thought and inquiry.

It is something which everyone 

—from the trustees to the last *
freshman—can look upon witb..“.7’-~;

genuine pride.

compounds, and Calgonite detergents——-including popu-
lar household versions of each—-are among the many
chemicals we process and sell for water treatment in util-
ity,. industrial, municipal and household water systems.

and to share-in the profit or loss
of the program. Speaking for his
motion, Kamin said, “It (the pro-
gram) will give SGA something
concrete to point at as an accom-
plishment for the year.”
SGA‘ Vice President Lois
Capin disagreed ‘with’ Kamin.
“There is a dire need for the
promotion of academic welfare.
There are enough groups to do
such things as bring the Kings-
ton Trio here,” she stated.
Pointing out that SGA, in a few
years, probably will have charge
of budgeting money to student
Capin said,
“We are not using our best_judg-

ment in the area of the‘ budget if
we sponsor a musical group.”

She concluded by emphasizing
that such a program is not in the
cabinet’s area. '
Finally, it was revealed that
the cabinet had no idea how
much it would cost tp bring the
trio here and _when the group‘
would be available. When the

vote was taken, only one of 17
members favored the motion.

A third motion, calling for the

Notre Dame
Brings   3-4
Mark Here

By JACK SlVIITH

A near-capacity crowd of
58,000 is expected to witness
the battle Saturday of one of
football’s‘ top intersectional
rivalries when the Irish of
Notre Dame invade the Pitt
Stadium.

The Irish bring with them a
deceptive 3-4 record, and still
have lingering in their minds the

results of last year’s game when .

Panther quarterback Bill Kaliden
went around end, with only see-
onds remaining, for nine. yards
and a touchdown that beat the
Irish 29-26.

Also Notre Dame is coming at
the Panthers from a 14-10 defeat
at the hands of Georgie Tech last
Saturday. There isn’t much doubt
that the Irish will be out to re-
deem unpleasant memories of last
year’s Panther game

Thus far the Irish have had
\wins over North Carolina, Cali-
fornia and Navy, while losing to
Northwestern, Purdue, Michigan
State and Georgia Tech.

Since the series began in 1909,
Notre Dame has won 16, lost
eight and tied one. The Pan-
thers, however, have won two
of the last three encounters.

Even when the Irish. don’t win,
Coach Joe Kuharich’s team plays
some of the most exciting football
in college football today. An ex-
ample of -this is just two weeks
ago when "the Irish were tied with
Navy, 22-22, with only seconds
remaining, .

Big End Monty Stickies, who
stands six-foot-four and weighs
255 pounds, stepped into the situ-
ation and kicked a 43 yard ﬁeld
goal to win the game. Stickles, an
All—American end candidate, is
an outstanding pass received and

’ ﬁne kicker. ~

Although the Fighting Irish
are only fair defensively, being
particularly weak at the center
and guard positions, they pos-
sess a ﬁne running and passing
attack. Look for Quarterbacks
Don White and George Izo to be
throwing to end Stickles. Also
look for Halfbacks Scarpitto and
Red Mack to lead the ground
attack.

Harriers Hopes

Rest on Rush,
H inchberger

’By TED COLTON

 

Carl Rees, coach of the Panther harriers, will be taking his
ﬁrst team to the ICAAAA cross-country meet in New York next
Monday. Rees took over the head coaching job last January when
Carl ‘Olsen retired. This year's team, although having an unimpres-

. _‘sive record, can amend things by making a good showing inNew York.

Rees will be depending on two individuals tocarryp the team in
this championship race. Ron Rush, senior captain, and Bill Hinch-
berger are the two boys who 'must‘come through for the Panthers.

,Rush is closing out a brilliant career at Pitt. In the three years
that he has been running against varsity competition he has won 14
races while never ﬁnishing lower than ﬁfth place. He has dropped
eight meets ﬁnishing second in’ three of them. But the big question

. will be can Rush ﬁnish high in the IC4A.

 For some strange reason Rush has always run poorly in this
big race. Last year he ﬁnished in the thirties while in his sopho-
more year he placed in the forties.’ Rush can do better than this
and the Panthers will be counting on him this year. He should
ﬁnish in the top ten.

Hinchberger has also been a mystery to Rees. “Bill is a hell of

'a runner. He can be as good as Arnie Sowell if he -convinces him-

. self that’he can do it,” Rees stated. These" are pretty big shoes to

’,put the young junior in, but Bill showed last Saturday agianst N .Y.U.
that he might just be able to ﬁll them.

Although he ﬁnished fourth in the meet he was only a second

 off the old record that was broken by three men that day. And

f Bill was not even winded. Hinchberger ﬁnished 150th last year in

 the IC4A but should be up there invthe top 20 next Monday.

The other four runners will have to come through with top
performances. Reed Clarke, Bob Stuck, Mickey Jiipina and Don
‘Adams will complete the six-man team. Clarke has been the
Cats’ most consistent runner this year. He was hampered by ill-
ness early in the season but has come on to look really good in the
last couple outings. 9 ‘ 0

Stuck has been a disappointment so far this year. Two years

V ago he was the high school.state champion and Rees was depending

on. him for his number-two man. .But so far this season Stuck has
-run only one good race and that was against Ohio U. A top per-
‘formance by Stuck could mean a lot for the Panther cause.

Jupina has been the Panthers’ hardest worker. He doesn’t have
the ability that Rush oi-"Hinchberger has but by sheer drive alone he
has made himself into a respectable runner. Unfortunately for Rees
and fortunately for Mickey, he has been accepted into dental‘ school,
and in the last few weeks has not been able to spend much time at
practice. His running has suffered because of this. Adams will not
be counted on too heavily.

Last year the Panthers’ had a record of 4-3-1 and ﬁnished 12th
in the IC4A. Rees -commented: '

“Some people say this year’s team is better than_ last year even
though our record is poorer. (Panther record is '2-4.), I'm hoping
that we can ﬁnish higher than they’ did last year. If all the boys run
like we feel they age capable of doing, we should do all right.”

   

   

Panthers Gofor No. 
Against Fighting Irish

53,0000 Expected’ At tsadium; 1
Sophomores eGl: Big Test

By TED COLTON . ,
Hold on to your hats! The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame
are coming to town and if the game Saturday is anything

like last years encounter the 58,000 expected fans will get

their money’s Worth,

The Panthers will be trying for their ﬁfth win er the
season against four losses. If they can take the Irish,‘ John

‘Michelosen’s ‘crew will be assured

of a .500 season.

On the other hand Coach Joe
Kuharich will be trying to get his
team up to the .500 mark as the
Irish are 3-4. Both teams need a
victory to make respectable sea-
sons out of what has been poor
ones for both teams so far this
year.

Must Prove “New Look”

The" “new look” Panthers will

be out to prove that the: ﬁne run-
ning game they displayed against
Boston College last Saturday ‘was
no fluke.

.'.ll eyes will be on Fred Cox
and Jim Cunningham who ran
~-like All-Americans last time
out.‘ Cox a sophomore may be
the best back the Cats have
come up with in a long time.
After surprising everyone inthe
UCLA game by turning in a
sparkling performance Cox went
back in to the obscurity of the
second team for the next four
weeks. Then suddenly after being
promoted to ﬁrst string he scored
16 points against Boston College.
Cunningham At Fullback
Cunningham- was slated for the
number one fullback position
when the season started. In the
ﬁrst three games he had trouble
holding on to the ball and this in
turn affected his running game.
During the UCLA game he
received a leg. injury and did
not see action again until Syra-
.cuse. Here he played very lit-
tle. Then against Boston Col-
lege he really looked like the
-fullback that the pre-season rat-
