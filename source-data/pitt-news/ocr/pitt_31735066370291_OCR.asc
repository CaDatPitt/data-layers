pleas for divestment

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer '

Yesterday. the university board of
trustees unexpectedly granted pro-
testing students the opportunity to ad-
dress the board on the issue of
divestment.

Minutes before the meeting began.
board chairman Robert Kirby re-
arranged the agenda to allow Doug
Howell. a member of Students for a
Free South Africa, five minutes to
make a statement concerning the
students’ position on divestment.

In his address, Howell reiterated the
position of SFSA. the Black Action
Society. Athletes Against Apartheid
and the approximately 2.500 students
and faculty members who have peti-
tioned the board to divest the univer-
sity of South African-related invest-
ments.

Howell accused the board of basing
its policy of selective divestment on
“the myth that we are helping the
blacks in South Africa." The purpose
of his address, he said. is to “disman-
tle that myth. That myth is deadly."
He pointed out that the death toll in
South Africa is over 1.000.

Sullivan signatories, Howell said.

Students
protest
investments

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

Some 100 students braved the cold
and snow yesterday to protest Pitt in-
vestments in South African-related
companies. The protest was occasioned

by a meeting of the board of trustees _

that afternoon.

“This is a way to show we care.”
said Pitt student Kimberly Rogers.
"They can‘t do whatever they want
without people noticing."

The protesters. led by the Students
For a Free South Africa, marched in
front of the Cathedral of Learning for
nearly an hour before moving to Forbes
Quad to greet the trustees.

Participants in the demonstration
were a diverse group of students, facul-
ty and Pittsburgh residents.

Thirteen-year-old Dubois Milliones
was clear about his opinion. ‘‘I think
it's not right for Pitt to invest in South
Africa and help the white racist govem—
ment keep blacks enslaved.”

City Controller Thomas Flaherty
also participated in the demonstration.
as he did in a similar protest march at
CMU last Monday.

we charge you with genocide.”

blacks?’ ’

 

employ less than one percent of the
total black work force on South Africa.
"If you ask those blacks if we're
helping them. they’ll say. ‘Get out of
South Africa." ”

Posvar reported that the university
had sold stock in 15 corporations that
have not signed or_do not enforce the
Sullivan Principles which call for
desegregation of the workplace. Pitt
presently has about $19 million in 30
companies which do business in South
Africa. ~

"Our intention in pursuing selective

divestment and supporting the.Sullivan -

Principles is based on our sincere con-
cern about social injustice." Posvar
said. “We are staunchly opposed to the

- South Africa government in every way,

we are totally. Lmalterably opposed to
their policies pertaining to social
justice. and we seek every way that we

us

prove the situation for blacks is by a
scholarship program. Pitt has given
financial support to four South African
students as part of the university’s par-
ticipation in the national organization
the South African Education Program.

The other major issue addressed by
the board of trustees was the Pitt-CMU

Students would be less critical if they
fully understood Pitt’s policy on divest-

ment, said Pitt president Wesley Posvar ‘

in a recent interview -with The Pitt
News.

“Peopletry to take what they think
to be a moral stand,” he said, “but the
most unfair position to take is that
we’re soft on apartheid.“

Posvar said many students do not
realize how committed Pitt investors
are in supporting companies that op-
pose the apartheid system of govern-
ment in South Africa.

The board of trustees currently sup-
ports a policy of selective divestment
from companies doing business in
South Africa. Pitt funds are divested
from those companies that do not
adhere to the Sullivan Principles, a set
of regulations calling for desegregation
of the workplace", fair employment
practices and a commitment to improv-
ing the quality of employees’ lives.

Posvar said those companies that
have supported the Sullivan Principles
are constantly reviewed by Pitt’s
investors.

“Pitt is divesting in all companies
that are not actively fighting apart-
heid,” he said.

The board of trustees voted last May

’ to adopt more rigorous standards of
performance from companies doing

business in South Africa’. The univer-

 

sity does not only rely on the Sullivan

reports. they rely primarily on the  ‘ 0

reports of two world-wide organiza-
tions. In making its investment and
divestment decisions, Pitt reviews the
findings of the Research Consortium on

American Corporate Investments in X ~

South Africa and the International
Council for Equality of Opportunity
Principles, Inc.

If these reports ﬁnd a company is not
making satisfactory progress under the
Sullivan Principles, Pitt will divest
from that company-, Posvar said. Com-
panies rated satisfactory are reviewed

regularly, independently of the Sullivan ,

reports.

Pitt has also subscribed to the In- __

vestor Responsibility Research Center,

an independent, non-proﬁt organization _

that analyzes economic and social
issues that affect institutional investors.

Since subscribing to these reports last
May, Pitt has divested from; 15 com-
panies that signed to adhere to the
Sullivan Principles, but were not mak-
ing satisfactory progress following
them.

Pitt now holds stock in 34 companies
doing business in South Africa,
representing $19.6 million of
investments.

“The rate of divestment will slow
down because we’re running out of
companies that fall under that
category,” Posvar said. '

Posvar defended Pitt’s support of 0

BERLIN — Soviet dissident Anato--
1y Shcharansky was released in an ex--
change of spies and dissidents by the
East and West yesterday morning.

Shcharansky had served eight years of

a 13-year sentence for what
Washington labeled as a trumped-up

conviction as a CIA agent. Shcharan-

sky. champion of the so—called
“refusenik" movement of Jews
wanting to leave the Soviet Union. was
to ﬂy by helicopter to Frankfurt for a
reunion with his wife and then to Israel
by plane.

Security sources said the trade in-
cluded three other people from the East
— two Germans and a Czech accused
of spying for the West. The sources
said ﬁve convicted spies f_rom Western
jails went to the East. They included
a couple jailed in the United States for
spying for Czeehoslavakia. a Pole. a
Russian and an East German jailed on
spy charges in West Germany.

Tainted Tylenol
discovered in NY store

NEW YORK CITY — Police in
Westchester County, N.Y. said a
woman who had taken two extra-
strength Tylenol capsules apparently
died of cyanide poisoning. The tainted

capsules were from a batch with the lot
number ADF—916. The Food and Drug
Administration advised consumers not
to take capsules from bottles with the
same number.

In the fall of 1982. seven people died
in the Chicago area because of cyanide
poisoning in Tylenol products. The
tragedy resulted in the use of tamper-
resistant bottles for consumer products.
In the newest incident. Diane Elsroth
died on Saturday at the home of a
friend in Yonkers. N.Y. A medical ex-
aminer said cyanide was found in her
stomach and blood. Cyanide was also
present in three capsules in the bottle
she used.

Near miss occurs
over Georgia skies

ATLANTA — Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration officials are investigating
a scare at 31.000 feet over north
Georgia Monday night. Officials said
an alarm sounded in an air traffic con-
trol facility near Atlanta to warn that
a Chicago-bound Delta Airlines 727
was on a collision course with an
Eastern 727. After the computerized
“conflict alarm” sounded. a controller
ordered the Deltajet to dive to 29.000
feet. The Delta pilot recorded a near
collision.

Liberia offers
Duvalier asylum

PARIS — French government of-
ficials said deposed Haitian president
Jean Claude Duvalier has been offered
a new home in West Africa. Radio
France International said the country
of Liberia is ready to grant Duvalier
permanent asylum. but it's not known
whether Duvalier will accept. The
government ministry of cooperation
said Liberia has proposed that Duvalier
move there.

Duvalier has been in temporary
asylum at a luxurious French Alps hotel
since Friday. but he must leave the
country by Saturday. It‘s believed he
wants to live in a French—speaking na-
tion. but English is spoken in Liberia
— a country settled by former
American slaves. A minister in Haiti’s
new cabinet predicts elections will be
held on the Caribbean island country
within 10 months.

A scholarship of $250 is being of-
fered to undergraduate Administration
of Justice students.

The scholarship award. which will
be given in April, is sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh Police
Association. It is geared toward
students showing scholastic achieve-
ment and motivations toward police
work.

Students must apply by March 15 to
be eligible. Along with the application.
" a statement of approximately 500

words outlining the student’s career
goals and interests in the law enforce-
ment profession must be submitted. To
qualify. a student mLIst be a declared

"If all the good influences from

American corporate society are re-

V moved. that would be turning our back
on the black people of South Africa.
We would ‘be removing what little in-
lluence we have in changing condi-
tions." he said.

Pitt executive vice president Jack
Freeman said that university investors
are actively engaged in the consortiums
appraising companies‘ investments.

“were asking some tough questions

I and trying to become active, responsi-
ble investors,” Freeman said.

Pitt also has developed a program to

provide promising young black
employees of those companies in South
Africa full scholarships to study at the
University of Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh-based corporations doing
business have paid for the full travel

The UPPA was formed in October

The association is. in effect. a union

disciplinary actions and public affairs
and in dealing with the university ad-
ministration. It is an independent union
with its own bylaws and charter.

. Campus police officer William Kim-
mell. scholarship chairman. is the
organizer of the program on behalf of
the UPPA. Kimmell. also a graduate
student in the GSPIA program. said
that “the campus police officers are
servants of the university community.
and we [the UPPA] want to give
something to the university communi-
ty. something to help the students."

Another reason for creating the
scholarship. according to Kimmell.
was "to help guide well qualified. col-
lege educated people into police
work.‘7 He also added that the UPPA
stood behind the value of a college
education as an asset in police work.

African black students. and Pitt granted
them tuition scholarships.

Two of the students recently
graduated. and two are still enrolled in
undergraduate studies at Pitt. Posvar
said he hopes to educate more black
students in South Africa. and that the
university is considering offering them
money to go to college within the
African continent.

“It’s much cheaper to send a student
to Nigeria or Kenya than to transfer
[him] all the way to Pittsburgh,” he
said. “You could probably educate five
times the number of blacks.” A

Even though Pitt has only offered

scholarships to four blacks in South
Africa. this number relates to a report
on the South African Education Pro-
gram that the present capacity for
recruiting qualiﬁed South African
blacks for American universities is
about 80 students.

\

ion offers award

The "scholarship serves as a way to pro-
mote this belief.

The funds for the scholarship come
from the UPPA's treasury. All of the
money is from the campus police of-
ficers themselves in the form of UPPA
membership dues and also by fund-
raisers like rafﬂes.

“There are approximately 300 ma-
jors [in the Administration of Justice
program] and we hope that we will get
a lot of applicants." said Kimmell. “If
we only get three or four applicants.
then we‘ll have to choose from those.
but I hope we get more." Kimmeil
pointed out that there is still plenty of
time left for people to apply. and
students with other aid are eligible.

This is the first year the scholarship
has been offered._ This year serves as
an experiment. If the program proves
successful. “it may become an annual
award." said Kimmell. As of now.
there are no plans for any other
scholarship programs.

Attitude of Fear

How many people regularly feel some
sort of fear each day? Probably a lot,
maybe most or even everyone. How
many think that their fear is probably a
product of their society? Maybe not as
many. but maybe they just never thought
about it like that.

I'm not talking about the fear of a
paranoiac or phobic person, I’m talking
about the fear that a normal, educated
person experiences. Just normal, human
fear — normal reactions to the everyday
stimuli we receive in the world. Let me
give a few examples of what I mean.

You're waiting for the bus at night,
alone on Fifth Avenue. You’vejust read
today's story about the latest murder,
rape. beating or mugging. The thought
tends to stick with you as cars pass by,
some of them suspiciously slowly. The
cold wind is the only other sound. and
you think. You fear. ~

It‘s Saturday night. and you're driving
home from a party, and so are a lot of
other people. You’re not drunk, but
maybe they are. The entire drive home
is riddled with nervousness, until your

. car is parked, and you have nothing left

to fear. But once you experience a» close

call with a drunk driver, you never forget
it. Each time you get in the car, the
thought of that danger comes to mind +-
on Monday morning or Saturday night.

Or how about this: You live alone in
Shadyside, you’re female with no one to
meet you at the bus stop. Soyou walk
alone down Aiken Avenue. Everybody’s
told you how unsafe it is, but what choice
do you have? A person has to live,
doesn’t she? You walk quickly to your
apartment, keys in hand, ready to ur1.lock
the security door. You’re inside, safe
from the unsure world of the dark. As
you lie in bed, reﬂecting on theday, you
recall the story about the women who
were attacked in their own apartment.
You shiver, picturing yourself in that
situation, but then resolve that it‘s
senseless to live your life in fear. Yet you
can't help but wonder if any place is safe
anymore.

As a man you worry when you're
alone, and though you may not worry
about rape (although perhaps you should)
you probably worry about being mugged
or beaten. Each time a gang of youths
passes by, you’re nervous until they‘re

you might not be able to fight them off
or outrun them anymore. But you get
home and also think to yourself: Is any
place safe? Is my home even sacred
anymore?

All of these people get home and might
watch the 11 p.m. news or read the

Ramblings From The Dgqgths/Ad

am Eisenstat 

Classroom Guerrilla Punctures The Boredom

Those who have passed through the
many classes. teachers and grade levels
necessary to enter college cannot help
but notice how much "higher" educa-
tion resembles every other level of
education they‘ve known. Modern
American universities do not seem to
realize that higher learning, no matter
how complex the material taught may
be, is not really elevated when it is
perceived by students to be a mere con-
tinuation of the type of learning with
which they are so familiar and tired.
Universities are mired in the same stale
and traditional formats. These tradi-
tions must be attacked and ultimately
supplanted if the university is ever to
be a relevant center of human growth.

College classes are run in the same
way as those in the proverbial one-
room schoolhouse. Students come to
class with books and pencils, prepared

to listen quietly to someone standing.

before them who, by virture of age,

wisdom and that all—important title of
Ph.D./professor.‘ knows more than
they do. This extremely traditional

scenario has produced within all con-

cerned parties an almost instinctual
code of classroom protocol. No one has
to be taught even the fine points ofthis
code. From calling professors by their

’ titles (an amazingly stilted and elitist

practice) to speaking in turn. the stu-
dent body nationwide has been
well—indoctrinated.

Advocates of traditional means of
education might argue that the protocol
is necessary and that the one-sided
teacher/student relationship continues
year after year because it works. May-
be it does, but for whom? Students who
wish to obtain practical techno/business
degrees? Sure. Teachers who teach as
a necessary evil, to supplement their
scholarly, reputation-enhancing
research and writing’? Sure. The old
ways are safe. efficient and untrying

for the career academic who. after all.
has had to go to school for eight or
more years and engage in predatory
tenure struggles to get-where he is.
Well. for those of us trying to get a
real education during our tenures in
college, we who do not give a damn

what obscure articles or arcane books .

a teacher has written. the protocol and
complacency of academia is stifling. It
is a wall that is erected and solidified
with every class. A

One time I had a class in which the
stasis and _ennui so common to most
classroom rituals was continually
challenged and subverted by someone
whom I’ll refer to as the Classroom
Guerilla. With a probing intelligence

and with a brash demeanor that allowed

him to say the most outrageous things,
this mere student turned an otherwise
bland and tedious class into a very in-
teresting, entertaining and inspiring ex-
perience. In one term of one class. he

managed to destroy many assumptions
of correct classroom behaviour. In do-'
ing so. he made the material come alive
and burst through its suffocating
academic confines. The subject was
real and alive to him. so he made it real
and alive to the class.

Sometimes he said things that seemed
completely irrelevant and derailed the
professor's train of thought. Other
times. he brought up very relevant but
obscure facts that went over practical-
ly everyone‘s head. He was offensive.
abrasive and overbearing. He could
also say some very stupid and misin-
formed things; but the noble and gifted
aren’t afraid to look stupid. That's part
of the risk they take.

Unfortunately, he managed to

" alienate and severely disturb almost

everyone in the class. They didn‘t
understand his tactics. They took his
ranting and raving personally (and

seriously) and subsequently shut him
off every time he spoke. They were not
prepared for such an innovator. He
lacked credibility in their eyes. He was
not a "proper“ student. But I saw what
school could be like if it was impudent,
passionate and reckless.

The responsibility for invigorating —

education should obviously be with the

V teacher. The teacher should attack and

invite dispute instead of embracing the
smug role of knowledge—imparter. He
should dangle the putrid carcasses of
received opinion before our very eyes.
He should be the Classroom Guerilla.

I wouldn’t count on it, not in this
century at least. Universities are too in-
fested with tradition. It isn’t in their
best interests to change the present
system. One who desires education
with soul must either abandon college
or try to inject his own brand of
creative antagonism into the learning
process.

Washington Post Writers Group/Richard Cohen
How People Behave  

Before I could write this column I
had to call my parents in Florida. I had
to ask ifI could write that my mater-
nal grandfather. seemingly the storied
immigrant of American mythology.
tried to abandon his family. After com-
ing to America. he was pressured by
relatives here to do the right thing. On-
ly reluctantly did he send for his wife

and children. That's how my mother’

came to America.

My paternal grandfather was hardly
a mythmaker. either. He. too, came to
the United States with a promise to
make enough money to send for his
family. He, too. let time slip by until
the woman he had left behind — an ar-
ranged marriagerin any case — must
have seemed less and less attractive.
Under pressure from relatives, he, too,
finally sent money for the passage.

I cite these stories from my own

family lore by way of saying that the
behavior now associated with inner-city
blacks has been seen before. I raise it,
further. with the absolute confidence
that what was true for my family was
true for many others. You don‘t have
to go back far in any family. especial-
ly one that was once poor. to find the
relative who went out for a pack of
cigarettes and never came back. In
time. the kids called a different man
"daddy.”

It is important to dredge up the worst
of your family‘s history because in-

creasingly people are citing the ap-

parent disintegration of the poor black
family as proof that there is something
awfully wrong with young black men
— something in the genes.

In a Playboy magazine article, Hod-
ding Carter III quotes a fellow guest at
a Washington dinner party as saying,

“You have to face the fact that some
people are culturally and genetically
unsuited for democracy.“ I have heard
the same sort of thing. This so-called
facing of the facts is nothing new.
When enough “facts" get faced. peo-
ple wind up getting lynched.

The awful truth is that no one can
totally explain what is happening to the
poor black family. No one really knows
the precise cause of the high rate of out-
of—wedlock.births. or if there is only
one cause. There are studies to show
that welfare is a factor, studies to show
that it is not and guesses at what would
happen if (as some have suggested)
welfare were abandoned altogether.

Like the archetypal immigrant family -

where one son becomes a cop and
another a crook. there is no explain-
ing why welfare launched many blacks

into the middle class and kept others
hooked on the dole.

Of course. it's too simple‘ to compare
my grandfathers with ghetto kids of to-
day. They have come from different
cultures. different eras and. besides,
my grandfathers reluctantly wound up

' doing what‘s called “the right thing."

(A cousin, though, did not; the family
heleft behind in Europe eventually
perished in the Holocaust.) Many
others — as countless ofthe poor have
always done — abandoned their
families. raising new ones whose
decendants now make sancitmonious
remarks about the innate immorality of
blacks. -

Things change. but they also remain
the same. The lifestyle of poor urban
blacks is also a product of culture and
economic reality —— unemployment,
poverty and, yes, it’s intended antidote,

welfare. When people are poor, when
they simply cannot cope with life, they
behave in ways that may be immoral
but that make sense to them. This is not

how blacks behave: it is how people _

behave. The "gene" for immorality is
carried within us all.

In a different era. people wondered
about men like my grandfather. They
said their poverty and exotic ways were
in their "blood." The American

mythology of immigrant success later i

washed over the dismal reality and
cleaned it up. But the harsh truth is that
the poverty that ravages the poor black
family oftoday also blighted the white
poor of yesterday —— maybe not iden-
tically. maybe not as extensively, but
certainly as tragically. When it comes
to immorality. the house we all live in
is madeof glass. Throw stones at your
peril.

In a Monday night address, Dr.
Christine Helms claimed the Iran—Iraq

5 I war could have an impact upon the

United States and its principal allies.
“The West.” she said, “has great
strategic. economic and military con-

cerns resting upon the outcome of the
war."

that part of the Mideast currently
engulfedin conflict is vital to U.S. in-
terests. She sees both Iran and Iraq to
be of great importance to American ob-
jectives in the area.

“Iraq is a front line for the entire
region." said Helms. It is centrally
situated to play an important role. Iran
is considered vital by both super-
powers.”

Helms noted that Iraq is particular-

41;»

ly valuable, for it is bordered by
Turkey. whose forces are crucial to
NATO security in the Mideast.

Economically. Helms contends the
destabilization brought about by the
Iran—Iraq war could pose a real threat
if the United States is ever once again
faced with an energy crunch, a
phenomenon that she feels is not so
distantly remote.

“It’s not out of the U.S. govern-
ment’S mind, though it’s out of the
public’s that an oil crisis may be upon
us in the next decade,” said Helms.
“Our goals are the security of oil and
the security of Israel."

America’s failure to quickly take
cognizance of the war in its early
stages. Helms alleges, is part of the
reason the conflict currently poses a
threat.

"In the beginning. the United States
did not focus upon the consequences [of
the war] much.” said Helms.

To predict the outcome or potential
ramifications of the war, Helms said
she feels it is important to understand
and analyze the conflicts, causes and
participants.

“It [the Iran-Iraq war] is a deeply
devisive ideological fight  and not
one, as widely thought by the West,
over territory,” Helms said. “It has
been a battle between two diametrically
opposed ideologies, Arab nationalism
and Islamic fundamentalism.”

Economics and status hinder blacks in white colleges

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

"The black students need to come
together now in the dream that Martin
Luther King Jr. spoke of. We have to
ﬁght for human rights.” — Diana White,
assistant chairman, Black Action Society

“In the university there has been a
rededication to the commitment of quality
education and equal access to black
students." — Assistant Provost Jack
Daniels

"The administration is not taking us
seriously.” — Dr. Lloyd Bell, professor
of black studies

“Black students need to ﬁght for their
rights.“ — Rashid Soudiata. Black Ac-
tion Society

Twenty-two years have passed since
the enactment of the Civil Rights Act.
Many social services and programs were
started to help minorities and to increase
their education. Affirmative action, the
core of civil rights. allowed for the hir-
ing of minorities and women in areas
from which they had previously been ex-
cluded. The black community was ex-
pected to increase tremendously both
academically and socially. As time has
passed. these achievements have become
the focus of national attention and have
undergone evaluation. But has the status
of blacks really changed‘?

The National Urban League has com-
piled a report entitled “An Overview of
Black America in 1986." which might‘
indicate that the status change has not
gone as planned. In the report. David
Swinton. director of public policy at
Clark College said that in 1985 the U.S.
economy experienced what many view-
ed to be satisfactory recovery. Yet. at a
closer look, it is seen that the black
population has continued to be caught in
the clutches of a severly depressed
economic condition. “Many ofthe gains
in the past two decades in reducing racial
inequality have now been evicted," said
Swinton.

Also in the report, National Urban
League President John Jacob said that
during 1985 employment was down to
5.9 percent in white America while in
black America it was 14.9 percent.
“White America is getting on its-feet
while black America is struggling to rise
up off the ﬂoor," he said.

The condition of black education is
comparable to black employment. After
all, education is considered to be the
American way to achievement. If black
Americans are not moving upwards
socially, then the logical thing to ques-
tion would be the educational system
through which they pass.

Charles Moody Sr., professor of
education, stated in the National Urban
League Report that formal education is

-one of the /most important ways to

prepare for the future. Because of this,
it is essential for black students to take
part in the goals of the education system.
According to demographic projections,
by 1995, 40-60 percent of the school
population graduating into the work force
will be black, Hispanic or another
minority.

Yet, currently, black students are less
likely to go into high-tech fields. At the
University of Pittsburgh in the fall of
1983, only 132 undergraduate black
students entered engineering and only 41
black students entered law school.

But could such statistics be misleading?
Dr. Lloyd Bell of Pitt’s Department of
Black Studies feels that they are. He said
he believes that they are unfair- because
“the black population at Pitt is not large
enough to base any statistics on." He
questioned how someone can compare the
progress of black students with whites
when white students constitute the ma-

~

jority of the student body. “Naturally,”
he said, “they will have a higher show
of representation in the upper level
ﬁelds.”

At the Pitt campus in the fall term of
1983, undergraduate black students con-
stituted 7.8 percent of the total campus
enrollment whereas white students made
up 79 percent of the total enrollment.
Black graduate students made up 4.9 per-
cent of the total enrollment while their
white counterparts made up 80 percent.
Also, the black faculty constituted only
5 percent of the teaching population,
while the white faculty constituted 89
percent.

Moody said that overall it stands that
blacks are behind non-blacks in regard
to education. He said that according to
the “Equity and Excellence" report on
the educational status of black America,
“In 1980 only 19 percent of the total 18-
to 24-year-old population was enrolled in
college, as compared to 27 percent of
their white counterparts.” '

The question to ask now is: Why is this
occurring and what can be done?

In 1984, black families whose main
supporter had some college education
were four times as likely to be poor than

Il]I

their white counterparts, according to
Swinton. It is statistics such as these that
tend to frustrate the black student, and
many in black America are simply giv-
ing up.

Other reasons that explain the educa-
tional discrepancies between black and
white students can be found in the
“Economics of Racism U.S.A.: Roots of
Black Inequality." This report explains
that a college degree is less advantageous

for blacks than whites. It also points out _

the unfairness in the claim that blacks
simply need to further their education in
order to advance socially and economical-
ly, and it says a major problem imposed
on blacks is their inferior education at an
earlier level.

Many people hold the view that blacks
are genetically inferior to whites. Accord-
ing to the National Urban League report,
this myth has been discredited by scholars
but it continues to have an effect on black
academic achievement.

The “Equality and Excellence Report”
states that black students are often placed
in low-track classes and are therefore not
intellectually challenged. Such students
may begin to feel that they can not com-
pete with students on a higher level.

Diana White, assistant chairman of
BAS, said that she believes that being
placed in lower—level classes has a lot to
do with how black students perceive
themselves.

“Black students generally come to Pitt
through U-CEP [University Communi-
ty Education Program], and it is a good
program,” said White, “for those who
really need it. But sometimes a student
will start to feel that they aren’t as good,
or as smart as other students.”

Pitt junior Vernard Davis did not come
through U-CEP, and he feels this was to
his advantage. “A friend of mine in U-
CEP felt that the classes were easy," said
Davis. “He started to think that college
was going to be pretty easy. Then, when
he got into the other classes it was hard
for him to adjust. He was intimidated by
the classes because in U-CEP the classes
are small and you get a lot of individual

_ attention. I think that by not going

through the program I learned from the
start what was expected.”

‘.‘I do think that U-CEP has potential,”
continued Davis. “It does bring over half
the black students to Pitt, but it needs to
be upgraded. Since 1976 i_t’s had the same

1 it , [71:11 I:
It1II::1-El

budget."

Jim Raymond. advisor to BAS, and Dr.
Bell feel that the type of secondary educa-
tion that a black student receives is‘ ex-
tremely important to his attitude toward
higher education. They both feel that
there is a deﬁnite need for change at the
secondary level in order to improve_the
quality of education.

The status of blacks on predominantly
white campuses is another issue ﬁguring
into black education.

“When you are a black student who
goes to a white school, you may begin
to make an accommodation," said Jac-
queline Flemming, a professor of

psychology at Barnard College. “You-
may begin to accept a minority status,’
that of not really being a part of things.” .

In her new book, “Blacks in College,"
Flemming conducts a seven-year study‘
of more than 3,000 black students of
predominantly black public and private
institutions. The research indicates that
the black students attending a white in-
stitution do not usually have the same ex-
periences as the white students. The result
is that these students, according to Flem-
ming, “end up feeling abandoned by the
very schools that actively recruited them
and led them to believe that they would
receive support once they arrived on cam’-
pus." According to Flemming. “Blacks
on black campuses become more com-
petitive. more confident. and can make
greater strides intellectually than black
students who attend a predominantly
white college."

Raymond feels that a black college
does help to give a black student a
positive outlook. “Many times the bet-
ter education is offered at the colleges that
are predominantly white. I myself went
to Duquesne. because at the time I
thought that it offered the best educa-
tion." ‘

“I came to Pitt because I was used to
the inner city." said Davis. who is
originally from Philadelphia. “Ifthis was
a small tow.n. then I don’t think I would
have gone to a predominantly white col-
lege. I also think that a lot of black
students do come to Pitt because of the
amount of recruitment that is done.”

“I suppose that if I had to do it again
I would still go to Pitt. In the real world,
whites and blacks have to work together,
so I may as well get used to it,” said
Davis.

Raymond feels that organizations such
as BAS help the black students to cope
with any feelings of alienation they may
be experiencing. It also serves to bring
the black students closer together on a
personal basis.

Diana White, assistant chairman to
BAS. feels that the black students need
an organization like BAS. “It’s a place
where we can come together to share our
common interests. We need to bring a
cultural and political awareness among
our people," she said.

White feels that by having a place to
go where the students feel they belong,
they are more likely to lose their inhibi-
tions. White is an undergraduate in min-
ing engineering and she is faced daily
with the feeling that she is different. In
her engineering classes she is the only
black student as well as the only female.

“I know what it is like to go to class

_ and feel different, kind of on the outside

of things. But you just have to accept it
and make the best of things."

One of the concerns voiced by many
black students is their level of represen-
tation in the university. White feels that

it is important to have black students in-

volved in organizations such as the Stu-

Socialization is cause of  increased stress

 

 
  

By Bonnie Kartzman
Staff Writer

Crying doesn't tell the whole story.
Recent reports on stress suggest dif-
ficulties with the current conception

‘ ., that women experience less psycho-
_ logical problems than men because they
are socialized to cry or otherwise ex-

press their emotions. According to
studies from the last five years. this
supposed ability to diffuse stress
‘doesn’t explain a female suicide at-
tempt rate three or four times that of
men. Nor does it account for a higher

I report of anxiety and depression among

women.

According to Dr. Irene Frieze, pro-
fessor of psychology, both sexes of
students may experience the same
general causes of stress, including ex-
ams or academically related pressure,
job strain, or difficulties in adjusting
to being away from home. However,
there exist additional stress factors on
women.

“Women tend to have closer ties to
their family members," said Frieze.
“Late adolescence is usually a time for
breaking ties with the family, and men
tend to have an easier time with this
because they want to establish
themselves as independent males. This
experience for women, on the other
hand, might be more problematical."

Counseling center director Dr.

Robert Gallagher agrees. “There is
probably more in our upbringing to en-
courage males to move to independ-
ence, to break away quicker. A lot of
these messages get communicated
nonverbally to women, who may be en-
couraged to be more home based."

Socialization also contributes to
stress through the perception of females
as nonaggressive, resulting in anxiety
for nonconformists. In her book, The
Female Stress Syndrmne. Dr. Georgia
Witkin-Lano_il cites a study in which
college-aged women showed higher
anxiety scores than their ‘ male
counterparts.

“If girls are treated as though they're
aggressive, assertive, and achieving
impulses are unexpected and even
undesirable, we can logically anticipate
a high anxiety level in young girls as
they struggle to control these natural
impulses," states Witkin-Lanoil. “In—_
deed, girls do experience much more
anxiety than boys."

Dissenting responses to expectations
may also result in guilt feelings, ac-
cording to Gallagher. -He recalled the
situation a few years ago when women
were becoming increasingly involved
in engineering and getting job offers
across the country. The unfortunate
consequences, however, were stressful
encounters with mothers who didn’t
feel their daughters should move far
away from home. Gallagher noted a
“  tremendous amount of resistance
— a special kind of pressure."

Stress factors also include contribu-
tions from the realm of sexuality.
Although a popular assumption is that
the sexual freedom found in a college
environment is welcomed by both
sexes, both women and men experience
difficulties with this new situation.

“It is as stressful for males as much
as for females," said Gallagher.
“Students are very concerned about

“There is probably more in
our upbringing to encourage
males to move to ' in-
dependence, to break away
quicker. A lot of these
messages get communicated
non—verbally to women, who
may be encouraged to be
more home—based. ”

Director of Pitt ’s Counseling
Center

establishing quality relationships.
There is usually a lot of pressure to
get into sexual activity before any real
relationship exists, a kind of expecta-
tion with dating. There is a lot of
unhappiness about that.” A
Although there may be sexual activi-
ty in high school, Frieze feels there
may exist increased peer pressure in
college. “For many, it is possible for

the first time to live with somebody,
or stay out overnight. If a woman
doesn’t want to do this, she may get
peer pressure, resulting in a stressful
situation."

Despite the increased acceptance of

sexual activity. many females still com-
plain of social stigmas associated with
it. According to student Regina
McNulty, double standards still exist.

contrary to popular belief. “People say .

there’s nothing wrong with it,” she
said. “Guys sleep around, but if a
female sleeps with more than one guy,
she runs the risk of being labeled.“

“I like doing whatever I want,"
another student, Darla Barnhart, said,
"but it’s scary because you don’t know
how far is too far. People should have
their freedom without pressures, but
they exist.” . '

Other sexually related pressures in-
clude safety factors, especially in a city
university. Therapeutic time spent
alone on long walks or other outdoor
excursions are no longer an option in
an urban environment.

“College campuses have date rape
as well as exhibitionists to mention
a mild form,” said Frieze. “Chances
are that these instances will be more
true on [a] campus where many of these
students come from.”

“It is almost impossible to be a
young woman today without being
scared of harm,” added Dr. Gallagher.
“You just do not have the freedom to
walk the streets at night."

in women

Fear of rape alone is enough to create
a stressful climate, since according to
Gail McCloin of the Oakland Woman’s
Center, one out of every four women
will be raped.

“I hate the idea of wanting to go to
the library and having to take some-
body with me. I get stuck studying in
the dorm." said McCulty. “Sometimes
I have to stay after class for recitatio'n,

I’m afraid to walk back by myself.

Rape is my biggest fear.”

A final stress on the female college
student may be pressure to succeed. to
keep pace with the rapidly forward
moving image of the modern women.
The conventional roles of mother and
wife may not be adequate goals among
female peers for whom careers assume
an increasing importance.

“There is a lot of pressure on
females to respond to the modern im-
age of the liberated woman," said
Gallagher. _

"If they prefer the traditional path.
they feel guilty, like they're not doing
what they ought to be doing. There is
a pressure to be in tune with the
times.”

The popular notion that women en-
counter less stress than men because of
their supposedly instilled emotional
outlets, may be a misconception. Var-
ious pressures form many aspects of
college life may infringe upon the
female student’s mental well being.
Dealing with this amount of stress may
evidently require more than a good cry.

Profs assess stud
 with focus on practical skills  

By .William Young
Staff "Writer

Preparing students adequately for the
real world has always been a pressing
issue in academia. According to the
teachers attending the National Coun-
cil of Teachers of English this year in
Philadelphia, many students pursuing
careers in the areas of government,
business, journalism and computer
science are not adequately prepared
for the writing involved in these
careers. Part of this inadequacy has to
do with teaching methods employed in
academia which are hindering rather
than promoting clear expression.

According to the instructors at the
Conference, the style of writing that is
being taught in college composition
classes is not suited to the professional
world because the style, belles—lettres,
is elegant rather than practical and
simplistic.

At the University of Pittsburgh,
however, this does not seem to be the
case. According to John Camillus,

N associate dean of the Graduate School

/2;», V

of Business, most students that will
pass into business—related professions
have been adequately prepared for the
writing requirements that their jobs will
entail.

“Most of them have more than ade-
quate skills,” said Camillus.“We iden-
tify those who need help or a little
strengthening and put them in a class
that will increase their writing abil-
ities.”

The problem of belles-letters writing
seems to have been phased out and
replaced by courses which attempt to
teach ways of writing more clearly.

“There was a time when it was
assumed that an educated person should
have been able to sit down and write
an elegant piece of writing, regardless
of its function,” said David Bar-

tholomae, a professor in the English’

- . department.

ﬁt

ate vase wxzd base we

 *8“ 5“?

The problem with teaching writing
skills, if a problem does indeed exist,
comes when people think they have
mastered writing when they have
mastered a few grammatical rules.
Style is something somewhat more dif-
ficult to impart to students. There is

\

clearly more to writing than writing a
correct sentence.

The English department sees its
responsibility in preparing the students
for writing within the university with
the task of developing outside writing
skills belonging to each individual
school.

“There’s no way the staff of the
English department. can teach someone
how to writea lab report or a memo.
The English curriculum is not designed
to prepare you to write for all types of
jobs,” Bartholomae said, “but rather
to give a general taste of all types of
writing. English courses aren’t de-
signed to give crash courses in lab

“We try to relate writing to
the understanding and com-
munication of some idea. Not
necessarily to do it eloquent-
ly but to do it to determine the
relationship of memory and
writing.

David Barthomae
Professor of English

report writing.

“No one can teach you what you
need to know,” Bartholomae con-
tinued. “You can learn how to do it;
you learn how to handle different situa-
tions. If the writing courses work as

' they ought, a physics students should

be able to take a class under a physicist
who writes.

“Ideally, he would study in a small
section in ‘the discipline, under the
tutelage of someone who actually
writes books or articles for magazines
in that discipline.”

The writing classes at Pitt are pri-
marily designed to encourage a person
to develop his own style and to impart
to them something about how a writer
works. They are taught many of the
skills of a writer without being told how

em ,  .

to write well. A set system of writing
is not taught, but rather the student is
forced to develop an effective way of
communicating his ideas clearly and
skillfully without being too prosy or too
boring.

Within the Graduate School of
Business, Camillus believes, the
primary aim of their writing programs
is how to get the point across in an
understandable way.

“We teach them primarily how to
get the point across. The most impor-
tant thing for them to master is point
of view. Very often, convincing the
other person on a particular point of
view is the basis of a paper in the
business field,” Camillus said. “It is
very important for them to get to the
point, to share your point of view.”

Writing for a purpose is also the
main theme of the English department’s
writing courses. Students are not en-
couraged to write beautiful pieces of

.prose that say more than they mean.

They are taught to develop skills which
quickly communicate the point of the
piece, yet in a stylish way that will not
lose the reader due to its dryness.
“I don’t think our department teach-
es the belles-letters style," Bar-
tholomae said. “We try to relate
writing to the understanding and com-
munication of some idea. Not nec-

essarily to do it eloquently but to do it _

to determine the relationship of
memory and writing. We want the
writer to raise some larger questions on
the topic at hand, not just to make pret-
ty objects.”

Writing programs ‘here at Pitt go
beyond the basic ideas of teaching a
simple form of writing within which an
author can implant his idea and spice
up the format with a few vocabulary
terms. The programs here attempt to
teach practical ways of writing. They
attempt to teach students methods of
writing that will enable them to raise

' a point and then develop it into an argu-

ment to convince the reader of the
validity of the point. Style is not thrown

' out for the sake of producing something

that only tells the facts, but is used to
convey them in a manner which will
hold the reader’s interest and bring him
around to the desired way of thinking.

‘ ‘Machme Gun

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

STORRS, Conn. —- Traveling away
from the friendly confines of the Fitz-
gerald Field House again has resulted
in a good effort by the Panthers. but
the results show Pitt has fallen short to
their host. The University of Connec-
ticut defeated the ‘Panthers 77-73.

The homecoming for Charles Smith
to his familiar stomping grounds was
spoiled for the second straight year.
Smith scored 21 points and grabbed 13
rebounds. but the hometown phenom’s
performance was overshadowed by 6-1
Earl “Machine Gun” Kelley.

It was a long night for the Pitt
defense as Kelley ripped the nets for
30 points while assisting on nine other
Huskie baskets. Kelley also failed to
turn the ball over once, and his team-
mates committed the basketball sin just
five times. The Panthers, however,
handed UConn the ball 11 times in the
evening, resulting in 15 Huskie points.

Connecticut’s fans did a more than
ample job of playing the sixth man.
Last night’s game was special, for it
was the last Big East Conference game
to be played in Storrs Field House.
They closed the complex with a 13-5
record in 18 Big East Conference
starts, and the victory extends their
home-win streak to 11 games dating
back to last season.

“We played good, not great, but
they played well on their home court.
It’s tough to win here when they shoot
70 percent from the ﬁeld in the second
half.”

Lady  

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers play host to the
Syracuse Orangewomen tonight at Fitz-
gerald Field House in a Big East Con-
ference game at 7:30 p.m. .

Pitt (9-12 overall and 4-8 in the'Big
East) should be pleased to return to its
home court after a tough three—game
road trip last week, which included lop-
sided losses at Penn State and Boston
College,

The Boston College loss was espe-
cially frustrating because two Lady
Panther starters, forward Sally Sheerer
and center Jenny Tyner, did not make
the trip because of an ankle injury and
the flu, respectively.

Sophomore Valerie I-lalesworth and
junior Pam Novosel made their first
career starts in place of Sheerer and
Tyner; and head coach Kirk Bruce
showed his pleasure with their

_ performances:

"I thought Val did pretty good. She
ran the team and she always plays real
strong defense. I’m sure she was ner-
vous about her first start, but it didn’t '
show that much," said Bruce. ‘Pam
hasn’t really recovered from her illness
[bacterial infection], so she couldn’t go
that long. We had to rotate her with
Patricia Paul and Tabatha Long.“

Beating Syracuse tonight will not be
an easy task for Pitt. The Orange-

For Smith, the return home was
soured by the UConn upset victory as
he and his teammates dropped their
sixth road loss in eight_travel dates. The
disappointment showed as Smith
reflected back on the game and the
team’s performance.

“Once you get behind. it becomes
really hard to fight back for the win,”
said a dejected Smith. “They’ve got
good perimeter shooters and they can
beat you in both a man-to-man defense
or in a zone.

“The problem tonight was foul shots
and our lost opportunities to come
back. Also, when you get down, the
best thing is to get it down inside and
not to take the long shots from out-
side,” said Smith.

The Panthers did get behind, and

they never recovered. The Huskies shot .

out to an early eight—point lead in the
second half and never let Pitt get to
within four points again. The Panthers
were their own worst enemy, as they
failed to capitalize on many key oppor-
tunities. The Huskies, on the other
hand, didn’t do anything wrong and
earned a victory that sent Pitt home de-
jected once again. Pitt’s chances for an
NCAA tournament bid took a severe
blow in the process.

“Everylloss hurts us right now,’
Smith said. ‘‘[It hurts] not only in
league play, but for the NCAAs after
that."

“To get to the NCAA [tourna-
ment],” Chipman added, “we need to
win 18 games, and that includes the
[Big East] tournament. This was an im-
portant game, as we wanted to get to
15 wins tonight.”

women (15-8 overall and 10-3 in the
league) defeated the Lady Panthers
78-68 at Syracuse on Jan. 11.
“Syracuse is always agtough team,
no matter where you play them. They
have a lot of individual talent and
quickness,” commented Bruce. “They
change defenses and they love the fast
break. They run that because of players
like [Felisha] Legette and [Janice]

The Orangewomen indeed have a
very talented team, led by pre-season
Big East All-Conference selection
Legette. Legette,’a 6-O forward, was
last year’s Big East Freshman of the

averaging 15 points per game, and in

said Bruce. “I thought we played a

in that ballgame, even though it ended
up being a 10-point game. We’re
looking to beat them, no doubt about ,
it.” ' >

Pitt’s main concern is the playing
condition of Sheerer and Tyner, the
team’s top two rebounders.

Bruce is optimistic. “I think Sally
will be ready to go tonight. Jenny might
be able to play, but probably not real
hard, so I’m not expecting her to
play." .

The Lady Panthers have played six \ '
of their last eight games on the road, ' i
but they finish the regular season with
four of the last five games at home.
With any luck Pitt can get back on track
and make the right preparations to
make themselves a factor in the Big
East Tournament (Feb. 27-March 2 at
Boston College). .

Bruce pointed out one of the team’s
major problems. “We seem to be turn-
over crazy. You can take it when the
defense is applying‘ pressure, but a lot
of our turnovers are unforced errors.
That's my main concern.”

The Lady Panthers have struggled in
the Big East so far this season, but
Bruce is confident Pitt can ﬁnish .the
season on an up note. “We’re going
to do the best we can. Our attitudes are
positive, and we’re going to get rolling
a little bit these last five games,” said
Bruce. “We’re dedicating ourselves to
going out there and playing as hard as
we can. It’s going to be rough, but if

 

done.”

we put our minds to it, we’ll get it _

PITTSBURGH — At first glance, it
may look like a swimsuit competition.
About 25 girls walk around the pool.
clad in blue and gold swimsuits. They
stop and chat with friends before they
find a place where they ‘can get
comfortable.

It’s then that you know there is more
going on than a fashion show.

Some of them stretch, using every
well-toned muscle in their bodies.
Others open books and try to sneak in
a chapter of biology before the work
begins. While others just sit around
sharing the latest gossip and enjoying
a few laughs.

Soon the coach appears and the girls
energetically head toward the water.
They, greet their coach with hellos and
smiles. but then it is down to some
serious business. '

This is just no ordinary group ready
to embark on a workout. This is the
University of Pittsburgh women’s
swim team. They finished this season
perfect once again. 11-0. Last season
it was 9-0. Twenty straight dual—meet
victories. Ranked no. 1 in the East.
Three—time Big East champions. work-
ing their way to a fourth title when Pitt
will host the championships Feb. 19-22
at Trees Pool.

But, they did not get where they are
today by just sitting around waiting for
something to happen. They got there
by working hard — by giving up some
of the free time that is so valuable to
college students. They have given it
their all.

"This is no doubt one of the most
satisfying teams I’ve coached." said
Belowich. “They are very motivated
and motivating. They. often motivate
me working with them day in and day
out. The bottom line is that they‘re nice
people.” ‘

worry about is problems arising be-
tween his swimmers. They work
together as one and are a very tight—knit
group.

"We consider ourselves a swimming
family, and the team has embraced that
philosophy wholeheartedly," said
Belowich.

While they may swim different
events, have different outside interests
and come from towns that are far apart.
they are all working toward the same
goal — winning.

“We combine people with very dif-
ferent backgrounds who have two
things in common," Belowich said.
“They’re interested in academics and
Pitt swimming.

“They’re all talented. What sets
them apart is their willingness to
sacrifice themselves for the team. It is
a ‘we’ team, not a ‘me’ team.”

The Lady Panthers have made many

. sacrifices. Going to practice at 6 a.m.

and then having to go to classes for a
full day is tough on a college student.
Then there is the time they have to put
in lifting weights. And then, as ifthat
were not enough, there is afternoon
practice and an evening filled with a lit-
tle relaxation and a lot of studying.

"We feel we have earned our suc-
cesses through hard work." said
Belowich. "To go undefeated you have
to be good and lucky. We're proud of
the fact that we work hard. but we've
also had some luck along the way. You
have to be in a position to put yourself
in a position to win."

Right now the Lady Panthers are in
the position they need to win.

At Hardee’s Invite

Strong showing by women

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

The Hardee’s Invitational, run in
Morgantown, W.Va., this past
weekend, was supposed to highlight
both the men’s and women’s track
teams. While the men held their own,
it was the women who shined brightly.

The women had many ﬁne individual
performances in many events, but two
events stood out: the 200-meter dash,
which saw Renee Henderson (ﬁrst), Pat
Cupid (fourth) and Angie Folkes (sixth)
all having a strong showing for Pitt;
and the 55—meter dash, with Hender-
son (second) and Cupid (fourth) leading
the way.

Other high finishers included: Han-
nah Russell in the highjump (second),
Amy DiFrancesco in the l,0O0—meter
run (second), Pam Roberts in the long
jump (third) and triple jump (third),
and the shuttle hurdle relay team,
which set a new school record of 31.2
seconds while placing second.

“If the meet had been scored. we
would have gotten 109 points and been
second,” said head coach Steve Lewis.
"The only team that was a step ahead
was Eastern Kentucky, and ’I think after
another week we will be able to
measure up to them.”

This was by far the women’s best

showing of the season, and Lewis was
obviously delighted. “We have pulled
ourselves out of the era where Pitt’s
women’s team is not respected. They
have earned the respect of a lot of
eastern schools in track and field.”

Amy DiFrancesco
Not to be overlooked are some fine
performances turned in at the meet by
Pitt’s men. .
Calvin Holmes won the 55-meter
hurdles, setting a personal record of
7.35 while qualifying for the IC4As.

In addition, Eric Cannon set a personal
record of 6.38 while placing second in
the 55—meter dash; Zeke Gadson placed
fifth in the same event with a time 6.47
that qualified him for the IC4As; Dor-
rell Hilliman placed fourth in the
300-meter run; Alan Laws placed sec-
ond in the 400-meter run; and Jesse
Mikell placed third in the 500-meter
run.

As well as running in Morgantown,
the men also ran at the Olympic Invita-
tional at the Meadowlands in East
Rutherford, N.J . Competing for the
Panthers were Lee McRae in the
55-meter dash and the two-mile relay
team.

McRae took second in the actual run-
ning of the event during the meet, but
when a special 55-meter dash was run
later so that Carl Lewis could compete,
McRae showed what he is made of.
McRae won the race with a time of 6.2.

The two-mile relay team did not fare
as well, however, as some shoving oc-
curred during the race. Panther Rodney
Giles fell and dislocated his shoulder;
forcing the Pitt team to be unable to
finish the race.

“I was really pleased with the way
Lee ran against some really good com-
petition but disappointed in the two-
mile relay because we thought we had
a good relay that could have done
well,” said head coach John Vasvary
after the meet.

Mugabi-Hagler: N o doubt about it

“It's alive. It’s alive! It's alive!" So
said Victor Frankenstein in the 1931
classic thriller after discovering that he
had been successful in bringing the
monster to life. “Frankenstein“ has
always been one of my favorite movies.
Ever since the first time he was
featured on network television, John
“The Beast" Mugabi has been one of
my favorite boxers.

It‘s amazing the bizarre and perhaps
twisted parallels that can be drawn be-
tween “The Beast" and the Franken-
stein monster. |

Don’t get mewrong. I don’t drink,
and I don’t do drugs. I arrived at this
unusual idea through careful thought.
Maybe that’s even worse. But any-
how 

Mugabi reminds me of different past

same as Louis. Mugabi is easily hurt.
But whereas Louis was knocked down
quite frequently. Mugabi has never
been knocked offhis feet in his entire
(pro and amateur) career. which is in

excess of 200 ﬁghts. On the other hand. A

Mugabi has yet (until March 10) to face
the best opponents. Most assuredly. he
will go down at some point in his
career, in fact. probably often. The
time when he was most seriously hurt
(in the third round against»Green).
Mugabi showed a lot of heart. not to
mention good legs by standing up to a
relentless barrage of punches. Both
Mugabi and Louis are easily hurt but
almost impossible to put away.

fighters at different times. It is almost  T
as if Victor Frankenstein has gone back " 

into business. Mugabi apears to be a ’

creation of various qualities of various

boxers sewn together. He is a collec- \

tion of the best and worst of some ring
greats.

‘He has highly underrated hand speed
just like “Smokin’ " Joe Frazier. Most
people are so entranced by a slugger’s
power that his other skills go unno-
ticed. This can make him even more
dangerous. It was Frazier’s secret
weapon, as it now is Mugabi’s.

: Mugabi can not only throw the big
'bombs, but he knows how to put them
together. He has a lot of boxing skills
to go along with his heavyweight
punch. This was always a quality that
Roberto Duran never got his due for,
much to his delight. When you are a
power slugger like Frazier," Duran or
Mugabi, opponents are extremely wary
of “the big punch.” But it is just that
strategy against these men that has
always proved most deadly. The more
overlooked these boxing ﬁnesse skills
are, the more successful that they can

 

Mugabi’s calling card is, of course,
his power. Actually. while he does
possess qualities from many different
ﬁghters, he is about 80 percent Stanley
Ketchel. Nicknamed “The Michigan
Assassin,” Ketchel was the middle-
weight champjust after the turn of the
century.'He has been called by some,
“the greatest brawler who ever lived. “
He fought with a relentless style that
usually ended with the big punch.
When he has an opponent in trouble,
Mugabi takes to the Ketchel way of
fighting. He wings punches from
another stratosphere with only the in-
tention of the clear-cut KO. His has a
one-track mind once he smells blood.
In many ways Mugabi shows the poten-
tial of reaching the level of men like

ful punches. and the round ends with
Hagler as the aggressor. Hagler‘s
round. 10-9.

0 Round Two: Hagler staggers
Mugabi early with a left hook. but
Mugabi recovers quickly and slows
Hagler’s charge with a straight right.
The pace slows for a few seconds. but
the last minute of the round has the
crowd on its feet. Mugabi gets the best
of the exchange and finishes by landing
two lefts and a right cross. Mugabi‘s
round. l0-9.

0 Round Three: Mugabi is caught
off—balance and Hagler scores a flash
knockdown with a right hook. Hagler
senses victory and throws punches
relentlessly. looking for the early
knockout. Mugabi is not hurt bad and
is able to slip or block almost every
punch of the flurry until a left hook
catches him flush at the bell. Hagler‘s
round. 10-8.

0 Round Four: Hagler is winded.
and Mugabi utilizes his underrated box-
ing skills to jab and hook his way
through this round. It is the calm before
the storm. Mugabi’s round, 10-9.

0 Round Five: Refreshed. Hagler
decides to trade punches with Mugabi
at center ring. They are fighting at a
furious pace, and the crowd leaps to its
feet. Mugabi catches Hagler with a
right hookflush on the chin, buckling
the Champion's knees. Hagler clutches
and manages to smother most of the en-
suing onslaught. Mugabi shakes him
loose and scores with a thundering
overhand right, and Hagler goes down
for a count of four. Mugabi lands two
more rights but misses with everything
else. Mugabi’s round, 10-8.

0 Round Six: The round’s first 30
seconds are uneventful until Hagler
snaps Mugabi’s head with a straight
left. But Mugabi is not hurt, and as
Hagler charges in, Mugabi almost takes

The Pitt News, February 12, 1986

A weekend full of thoughts:

The handling of the Doug West issue
by The Pitt News was well within the
scope of a student newspaper. Time
and again, all I hear is how we are the
student newspaper of the University of
Pittsburgh. Supposedly. our main
priority should be Pitt. not the Steelers,
not the Pirates. not pro-football. Peo-
ple tell me that we are not one of the

 Pittsburgh daily newspapers and we

should not try to imitate either.

Well, first of all, Pitt is our main
priority; there can be no argument
about that. Secondly, they say we
should not be like the Pittsburgh daily
papers, and that is fine. But the first
time we act like a student newspaper
and take a biased stand on an issue
(Doug West), they change their mind
and say we should be like one of the
Pittsburgh daily papers. It just does not
work that way.

I would have to guess that Villanova

lost the game before they even walked
on the court Friday night. Rollie
Massimino created a tense atmosphere
by making his team think they were
facing the ll0nS at the Roman

Jim Urban

Coliseum.

As the Villanova players warmed up
in an empty field house about 45
minutes before the game, they were
more concerned about the crowd than
they were about the game. As it turned
out, the only incidents that occurred
were on the court between the players.
The only confrontation between a fan
and a member of the Villanova team
happened not in the student section, but
in the blue seats.

 Some hindsight on last Weekend

It seems that Massimino and a man
sitting in the second row behind the
Villanova bench made a date for the
parking lot following the game.

Nothing came of it. I guess
Massimino wastoo tired after lectur-
ing the media for five minutes on what
does not belong in college basketball.

I guess it was a learning experience
for us all. I learned a little about jour-
nalism, and Doug West learned a lot
about playing basketball at Fitzgerald
Field House. . '
