Book Center Controversy,-

 

Looking BackAt Issues Of Winter 1983

Tuition Hike Proposal
Highlight Term  

By CHRISTINA CLINTON
And BRIAN BALK

Winter term 1983 was ‘a big year
for news at Pitt. From the Panther’s
loss to Southern Methodist Univer-
sity in the Cotton Bowl to allega-
tions that the university was
thwarting unionizing attempts by

Book Center employees, the term »

has not been an uneventful one on
campus.

Employees
Fired

Pit_t‘s Book Center gained city-
wide attention when two employees
were fired and three suspended for
one day for what they believe was
the university's attempt to thwart
unionizing activities by employees.

The fired employees, Tim Brady
and Chuck Delaney, said the univer-
sity gave them no reasons for their
terminations, but they believed it
was because the two tried to union-

ize employees as Local 101 of the‘

Retail Wholesale Department Store
Union.

When the controversy hit the
news, Pitt did not comment on it
because it said personnel problems
were internal matters and could not

be discussed publicly. The university
denied, however, the allegations that
the firings had anything to do with
the union-organizing attempt. ,

Attorneys representing the ﬁred
employees filed a grievance against
the university with the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board (PLRB).

After a span of close to two
months, the PLRB ruled that Pitt
did not attempt to stifle union-
organizing activity at The Book
Center. The secretary of the PLRB,
Patricia Crawford. said she based
her decision on the information sub-
mitted by representatives from the
Allegheny Joint Regional Board
(AJ RB).

“Although it may be generally
known...that there is a unionizatior
underway at the university, it wa:
not necessarily apparent from the
charges filed that there was any link
between the unionization and. the
actions that were taken by the uni-
versity.” There was some supple-
mentary information that was
dropped because of technical errors.
Crawford said there were some
questions concerning notarization
of some of the materials and legal
standards that had to be complied
with in order to sustain the charges.

AJRB immediately filed an
appeal to overturn the PLRB’s
decision.

CAS to ProbeAcademic Integrity Problem

By ANN O‘CONNOR

The issue of academic integrity,
on the part of both students and
faculty, has recently come to the
attention of some administrative
officials.

Reid Reading, assistant dean to
the College of Arts and Sciences and

.Academic Integrity representative

has speculated that the next major
project in CAS for the fall will be a
systematic study of the problem of
academic integrity.
V Such a study would include exten-
’sive polling of faculty and students
to determine views and perceptions
of cheating as well as of the present
academic integrity guidelines.
Assistant provost Ray Steele has
described the present objective of
the administration as one of raising
consciousness and discussing the
character of the cheating problem.
He added that the issue of academic
integrity was essentially two-fold.
First, the examination of cheating
would include a study of the present
system’s handling of the problem.
Second, the perceptions of the prob-
lem by both faculty and students
would be considered. Currently,
Steele is attempting to specify
improvements of the system and the
parameters of the problem.
The system for dealing with accu-

’ sation's of cheating or unfair practice

resulted from the work of a student

trustee who raised_ the_ issue of
limited student options in cheating
cases. After extensive deliberation,
the policy guidelines concerning
academic integrity were adopted by
the Board of Trustees in 1975 in con-
sultation with representatives of
Senate committees and student
organizations. As a result, in 1975-
76, the Academic Integrity Guide-
line System came into being. .

Reading explained that when a
student has complaints concerning
the quality of his work, the rules ofa
course, the grade received etc., he
proceeds to file an academic com-
plaint form. I

If the student wishes, he may con-
sult with Reading and an effort will
be made to arbitrate an informal
resolution of the problem. Other-
wise, formal adjudication proceed-
ings will take place including an
inquiry, a recommendation by a
joint faculty-student hearing board
and a final decision by the dean of
the school. In addition, all decisions
may then be appealed to the provost
or the University Review Board.

As to the extent of the problem,
Reading said he was hesitant to say
that cheating was rampant although
he admitted that some faculty
members might disagree. He said the
number of cases formally brought to
his attentiondo not appear large or
excessive. While he would not deny
a cheating problem existed, he said a

more comprehensive study should
be undertaken before speciﬁc con-
clusions are drawn.

Similarly, Steele cited the results
of his review of the academic integ-
rity problem as reporting 33 cases
actually started within the system

and 25 resolved before coming
before the Academic Inegrity Boardf
Seven cases warranted integrity
board action, and one was appealed
beyond the school for university
review. ,

‘Rocky Horror’ Closes
After Five Year Hiatus

By COLLETTE FERRIS

Going to see the “Rocky Hor-
ror Picture Show” at the King’s
Court has been a tradition
among Pitt students for five
years, but May 7, the tradition
will die a quiet death.

“lt’s~the ending of an era,”
King’s Court assistant manager
Bill Vollberg explained. “The
Kings Court played a part in
making it [the film] famous. 1
really hate to see it go."

As times change, so do the
crazes, and according to Voll-
berg, going to bars on the wee-
kend is more popular.

“Today, bar-hopping is the
thing to do,” Vollberg said.
“whereas before, ‘Rocky Horror’
had precedence." For this rea-

son, the theater has decided not
to re-lease the film for another
year. ,
“ ‘The Rocky Horror Picture
Show‘ ” was popular because it
was weird and allowed for an
abundance of original audience
participation,” Vollberg said.

“The audience can really let
loose when they see Rocky Hor-
ror,” he said. “They choreograph
their own lines and say th "m dur-
ing the show until there isn't a
whole lot more room for lines.”

The theater also made it a
practice to provide a stage cast to
help the audience to understand
and participate in “Rocky Hor-
ror." Vollberg was one of the
original cast.

Vira Heinz: University Philanthropist

Vira Heinz

Lunch
Buy one Whopper,
get one free.

By MARY ANN KRUPA

’The University of Pittsburgh has
been priviledged over the years to

; count among its supporters some
. very distinguished men and women,

and Vira Ingham Heinz was one of
the most illustrious.

Her death last week at the age of
95 prompted Pittsburghers to honor
the memory of a woman who had
devoted half a century to serving
humanitarian causes that helped
bring beauty, vitality and cultural
prestige to both the city and the
university.

A businessperson in her own right A

before her marriage in 1932 to
Clifford S. Heinz, son of H.J. Heinz,
the food processing magnate, she
was to become the first woman
board member of that company.

After her husband's death in l935,,.._.

she turned her talents, her money
and‘ her interest toward the
development of cultural, religious
and youth-oriented activities,
particularly as they were needed by

' the University of Pittsburgh.

‘‘It is difficult to capture the
essence of the friendship and
generosity that Vira Heinz bestowed
on the University of Pittsburgh for
so many years,” said Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. “It is typical of Mrs.
Heinz that she would make it
possible for the Heinz Chapel Choir
to tour France "as singing
ambassadors, reaching thousands
through the gift of music.

“From the most significant things
she did to the smallest things, such as
sending flowers each year for the
music program at the chapel, her
presence was an inspiration and a
blessing,” he said.

Posvar added that, “All of us who
knew her will sorely miss this great
and gracious lady who moved
among us with humility, elegance
and compassion, and who shared
with us her aspirations for the full
development of human potential.”

Much of Heinz’s interest was
centered around the women’s
studies at Pitt, and she was
particularly concerned with
fostering an attitude in ‘women that

would enhance them not only in the
academic sense, but in a social sense
as well. Her contribution of a
kitchen that was installed in the
Cathedral's 12th floor was part of
her wish to educate women in the
area of nutrition and domesticity
that she considered an important
part of women’s training for entry
into the world after college.

While this attitude seems
completely contradictory to the
ideal of women and achievement
today, for Heinz’s time, it was
acceptable to inspire women to seek
excellence as a wife and mother,
according to Helen Rush, the former
dean of‘ women and .a friend of
Heinz’ for over 50 years.

“She gave the kitchen as part of a
general program that included
women students,” said Rush, “and
she was very much interested in
preparing women students to stand
for the finest things that women
stood for. Therefore, she should
know something of the social
graces.” Rush added that Heinz was
dedicated to the idea that a student’s
y€ars in school should “represent
human excellence from every point
of view” and that the university’s
responsibility extended to instilling
in students an expectation of
achievement within and outside of

I the classroom.

In 1952, Heinz started a summer
travel program sending over 100
students to foreign countries,
according to Rush, “in order to
represent the U.S. at its best and
bring back the best of the
internatibnal point of view.” This
program was successful enough to

When Heinz received her
honorary degree from Pitt, Rush
was asked to present her with the

-honon

“Mrs. Heinz was a person of
outstanding excellence who cared
greatly about the individual. Her
passing is a loss to Pittsburgh and to
the university,” Rush said.

In addition to her honors from
Pitt, she received degrees from Tem-

ple, Duquesne, Wilberforce, Beaver, ,

Bethany, Thiel, Waynesburg,-
Washington and Jefferson and was
named a Distinguished Daughter of
Pennsylvania in 1949.

Much of the involvement with
women at Pitt extended to the field
of medicine, and in 19-53, after
helping to complete the building ofa
School of Nursing at Pitt, she
travelled to London to personally
bring mementos of Florence
Nightingale back to present to the
new school. A brick belonging to the
home of Florence Nightingale was
used as the cornerstone for the
Nightingale Room as a symbol of
the relationship between British and
American nursing schools, and

Heinz purchased rare prints of "

Nightingale from a London antique
dealer.

Heinz was also one of the
initiators of an expanded creative
writing program at Pitt and inJ974,
received the Chancellor’s Medal in
behalf of her works for the
university.

She has also been twice awarded
the title ofWoman ofthe Year by the
Business and Professional Women’s
Club.

Heinz will also be remembered for
her devotion to cultural projects in
Pittsburgh that included the
decision to revamp the old Penn
Theatre downtown and turn it into
Heinz Hall in 1971.
responsible for forming the Heinz
Galleries at Carnegie Institute and

Her interest in music extended not

to many other musical societies. She
served on the boards of the
Pittsburgh Chamber Music, the
Pittsburgh Opera and the
Pittsburgh Symphony Society in
addition to serving as board
president of the Pittsburgh Youth
Symphony Association.

Heinz was buried quietly in a
private family ceremony in
Homewood Cemetery.

Heinz last Tuesday at the Heinz
Memorial Chapel, where the Heinz
Chapel Choir, a group she had so
ardently supported for many years,
sang selections from Mozart.

Senior Of The Year, A Fighting Achiever

“hay ANN WALKER

For most students, receiving a
prestigious award is enough of
an accomplishment, but not for
one Pitt student. Guy Molinari
received the Omicron Delta
Kappa Senior of the Year
Award, which is given to seniors
who are recognized leaders.

“I’d have to say I’m happy but
not fully content; l’ll be a fighter
until the day I die, which sounds

 like something from a Wild West

movie,” Molinari said.
Molinari, who is majoring in
philosophy and politics and has a
long list of minors, including
economics, math, German and
classics, received the award in
March during the Honors

Born in Buffalo, N.Y., he has
been awarded a Chancellor's
Scholarship and an Undergradu-
ate Teaching Fellowship, to
name only a few. He became a
member of Phi Beta Kappa in his
junior year, and as a senior, was a
university nominee for the
Rhodes Scholarship.

He studied in Athens at the
American School of Classical
Studies, an award usually
awarded to. graduate students.

“I visited over I00 archaeolog-
ical sites. It gave me a great sense
of history, and what I learned
there can’t be bought. You real-
ize your smallness, and the trip
put my QPA into perspective,”
Molinari said. ,

“Before I came to Pitt, I knew I
would receive a challenge here.

is the second general editor of
The Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review. He was one of the three
founding members of the
Review, and over 300 colleges
and universities now subscribe to
the magazine.

“I tried to involve myself in
areas that would make a long-
term positive effect on campus-
for instance, the Faculty of Arts
and Science Council, where cur-
riculum reform is extremely
important,” Molinari said. -

He described ODK as the uni-
versity’s “think tank,” whose
members _are correspondents
between student leaders and
faculty. Ballots were sent out to
ODK‘ members and over 100 ran-
domly selected seniors to. choose
Senior of the Year. A committee

Molinari has left his mark—-
not only in the minds of
scholars—but also in the stone
along ODK walk between the
Cathedral of Learning and Heinz
Chapel. -

"'1’he stone carries a special
meaning, my true name is Guy
Nicholas Cornelius Molinari,
but the stone is inscribed Guy
“T.W.” Molinari, a-nickname I
picked up during my years here
at the university,” he said.

He said now that the stone is in
place, he worries more about
dogs than he ever did before.

His story is a familiar one: The
oldest of five from a small high
school with a graduating class of
17 comes to big city and makes

good. He says he feels deeply
honored by receiving the award.

Molinari‘s plans after graduat-
ing include eithertgraduate, med-
ical or law school. He hopes to
involve himself in some aspect of
leadership, whether in law or
business.

“Eventually, when I’m older,
I‘d really enjoy writing some
human interest stories, a “how to
survive in a world like this"—
type of book, he said.

For a talented student who has
completed five years of credits in
four years, Molinari finds time to
relax by reading. He also takes
time out from studying to enjoy
scuba diving, running and.
camping. .

Convocation.

“I believe there is a parallel
between my personality and the
University of Pittsburgh,” he
said. “Our qualities are much
alike, and we’re both waiting to

Tuition Hike
Proposed

Governor Richard Thornburgh
made it harder for students to stay in
Pitt with a 2 percent recommended
budget increase in state funding.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
announced that Pitt students will
most likely be hit with a 5 percent
tuition hike if the governor's pro-
posed budget is passed.

Posvar originally requested a 10
percent increase ($13 million) in
state appropriations from the Penn-
sylvania House Appropriations
Committee.

An ad hoc committee has been

formed by various student organiza- V

tions to fight the hike and lobby for
more student aid.

Alcohol
Consumption

Studied

Following the death of Pitt foot-
ball player Todd Becker in
December, university administra-
tors expressed concern over the
amount of drinking that was being
done on campus.

The director of the Office of Resi-
dence Life, Jo Ann Woodson, sug-
gested that a moratorium be placed
on all parties in the dorms until the
current policy could be studied and a
new one developed.

The moratorium was so unclear
that even Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) president Jay Nalli was
unsure of its meaning. Woodson
said she defined a party as being “a
group of people that are together,
b_ut it may or may not contain
alcohol.” ‘

During a meeting between RSA
and Woodson, it was determined

Term In Review

that there would be a ban on large
amounts of alcohol (kegs, cases)
going into the dorms, but Nalli was
unsure if a student of legal age would
be allowed to bring a six-pack into
his dorm.

After less than a week, and with
much protesting by dorm residents
and RSA officials, the ban on par-
ties in the dorms was lifted with a

‘promise that a new alcohol policy
would be developed.

In a related story, the Office for
Student Affairs, headed by Vice-
Chancellor Conney Kimbo, set up
three alcohol task force committees
to study the amount of alcohol con-
sumed by students and to investigate
the possibility that new policies were
needed.

The committees consisted of stu-
dents and administrators to study
the alcohol problem in three areas:
the dorms, the Greek system and
student groups and activities.

The results of the studies and any
recommendations are expected to be
released this summer.

Football Players
Arrested

Two Pitt football players were
arrested and charged with a number
of accounts of assault on Feb. 20.

Dave Puzzuoli and Dennis Atiyeh
were arrested and accused of
assaulting a woman police officer-—
DeVelma Coleman. Coleman was
admitted to a hospital with possible
back and neck injuries.

The first preliminary hearing on
Thursday, Mar. 3, was postponed
after the police asked for a continu-
ance because Coleman was still in
the hospital.

The preliminary hearing took
place on Wednesday, I Mar. 9.
Although police witnesses and
defense attorneys disagreed
throughout the. hearing, both Puz-
zuoli and Atiyeh will have to face
trial sometime this summer.

The Pitt News, Monday April II, 1983

iPHtLoses
ToSMU

The year began on a depressing
note for the Panther football team,
losing 7-3 to Southern Methodist
University in the 47th annual Cotton
Bowl Classic.

The game epitomized the season
for the Panthers. They were able to
move the ball well until they reached

A the Mustang 10-yard line——where

the offensive drives died.

“People ask if this was typical of
our entire season,” Coach Fogc
Fazio was to say at a post-game
press conference. “We didn't get it
in."

Others put the blame on penalties
or the threat of penalties.

“Penalties,” said cornerback Troy
Hill. “We got no breaks.”

Fazio explained differently, “The
aggressiveness of the defense was
ﬂattened by, what I should call
them, threats [from the officials].”

For many other Panthers, such as
quarterback Dan Marino and offen-
sive quard J imbo Covert, the season
did not end in Dallas. Both Marino

 and Covert were invited to the

Senior Bowl in Alabama and the
Hula Bowl in Hawaii.

Marino was selected as the Most
Valuable Player of the Senior Bowl.

New Board
lnagurated

Without much controversy or any
promises of radical changes, the
1983 Student Government Board
was inaugurated on Jan. 6 at Sol-
diers and Sailors Memorial Hall.

Mark Downs, the new president,
promised that the board would try
to fulfill all the expectations placed
on it by administrators and students.

Inaugurated to the new board
were Downs, Kathy Brown, Dan
Lecce, Jeff Schaffer, Barry Greene,
Ken Stram, Craig Murphey, Mindy
Goldberg, who was appointed to the
board after Mark Steele resigned,
and Jeff Delmontagne, who was also
a member of the I982 board.

During the course of the term, the
board has been busy with the alloca-
tions process. The only controversy
it ran into concerned the Italian
Club and that group’s annual
budget.

The Italian Club had requested
$170 to send the president and vice-
president to an exhibition and lec-
tures on Vatican Art Treasures in
New York City.

The request had originally been
turned down by the Allocations
Committee, but club president Anna
Maria Fato appealed to the board.
Allocations chairperson James
Shelton said the committee would
not approve the request because it
did not think the club as a whole
would benefit from the trip.

After a two-week period of much
deliberation, the club wasdenied the
$170 it needed to make the trip.

The board also came into the
limelight when it decided to express
its displeasure with the administra-
tion’s appointment of a student
representative to the Board of
Trustees.

The board said the administration
went over its head in appointing
Tom Hajduk without asking for stu-
dent input about the decision.

The board met with Senior Vice-
Chancellor for Administration Jack
Freeman last Friday to discuss the
problem.

Closes

The administration sharpened its
blades and cut another office which
aided the students in many ways-
the Internship Office.

The Internship Office will be clos-
ing ‘its doors at the end of the semes-
ter because of the lack of funding,
said Dr. Robert Gallagher of the
Career Counseling Center. The
‘office was initially funded by a grant
which has been discontinued.

According to Nancy Denhart, the
Internship Office coordinator, the

office helps students determine for

which internshipsthey qualify and
assists them in defining career goals.

“Internships will still be accessible
to Pitt students but acquiring them
may not be as easy," Denhart said.

Denhart is unsure of who exactly
will take on the responsibility of
handling the internships once the
office is terminated. She said the
advisers of the various departments
might assume the responsibility.

The Internship Office served
approximately 400 students last
term.

Semester At
SeaGrounded

The students aboard the S.S.
Enterprise encountered rought seas
on the Semester at Sea this year.

The ship collided with a sand bar ,

on Feb. 25 outside of Egypt. The
ship was then towed to Athens,
Greece, for repairs.

Although it was first estimated
that it would only take a few weeks
to repair, extensive damage made it
impossible to complete the voyage.
_ The students will finish the semes-
ter’ on April 12 at the Diplomat
Hotel, in Jerusalem, which is serving
as a makeshift classroom.

The students aboard this semes-

I ter’s voyage will be offered a refund

to compensate for this year’s sunken
semester.

Another of the voyage’s tragic
events was the death of Dean Tobias
Dunkelberger. Dunkelberger, 73,
was the former dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences.

Dunkelberger was with his wife
Esther Simons and daughter and
son-in-law, Judith and Jonathon
Wouk, at the ‘timekof his death.

Dunkelberger died and was bur-
ied in Jerusalem.

Certification
Policy Proposed

_ In an attempt to better define the
role between student groups and the
university, the Office of Student
Activities announced in March that
a new Student Organization Certifi-
cation policy had been developed.

The proposal would allow stu-
dents to freely form groups and
would allow the university to decide
which organization it wants to offi-
cially sponsor. .

The proposal, if adopted would
make two types of student groups:
registered student organizations and
recognized student organizations.
Registered student organizations
would be considered as private affili-
ations of the university and have the
same advantages as other groups,
such as using university equipment.

Recognized student organizations
would grant a student organization
official status in the eyes of the uni-
versity’s educational or extra-
curricular programs. In order to
apply for recognition, an organiza-
tion must first meet the criteria of
registration status and the petition a
“line officer" to gain the status.

Associate director of Student
Activities and main researcher and
writer of the proposal Terrence
Milani said the new policy was
needed because Pitt currently does
not have such a policy.

Summer lntrnships in
Homebuilding Management

WHY [om AN INDUSTRY
IN TRANSITION?

Because the future belongs to those who prepare for it. Ryan Homes... ‘
one of the nation's largest homebuilders, is actively preparing for the
future with investments in new products, programs, and most impor-
tantly, people. Our stable ﬁnancial resources, innovation and produc-
tivity have put us in the forefront of our industry today, and will keep
us there in the future.

    

This summer, we have outstanding opportunities for students who are
interested in learning homebuilding management from the inside out.
You'll be relocated, at Ryan's expense, to one of our major metropol-
itan markets on the East Coast. You will spend 10-12 weeks gaining
valuable exposure to all aspects of our business, including Planning,
Construction and Sales. '

These internships, which offer. competitive salaries, have a two-fold
purpose: they let us see potential managers at work, and they give
you a foothold on a promising future with our expanding organization.

We seek people with strong leadership qualities who are within one
year of receiving their degree. While Business degrees are preferred,
applications from Liberal Arts students with a demonstrated interest in
a management career will also be considered. Reliable transportation
is also required.

Right now is the time to join an industry in transition. Preparing
together, we'll both come out far ahead of the game. Send your
resume, and cover letter, today to: Personnel Dept. l, RYAN HOMES,

Senior Columns

From TryingTo Impress Girls...

By BRIAN BALK

My four years at Pitt have proba-
bly been the most exciting and inter-
esting years of my life. I never
thought I would change so much in
four years—change for the better, I
hope. And just think, it only was
four years ago, four short years, that
I first stepped foot on Pitt soil—I
mean pavement. I

Freshman year. The word for the
year was naivete. Coming from a
small town, I was completely ignor-
ant of the ways and means of the big
city.

For example, a long-haired
degenerate came up to me on the
way to class one day and asked me if
I “wanted to buy a nickel or some

~ coke?" I replied, “Why should I buy

a— nickel from you when I can get a
whole roll for a dollar at the bank,
and as for Coke, my doctor recom-
mended that I avoid all unnecessary
sweets and caffeine.”

Other fallacies which I believed
were: I thought the library was a
place to study, people went to foot-
ball games to be spectators, I
thought the Towers’ food was toler-
able, an 8 a.m. class wasn’t that bad
and wearing my high school letter-
man‘s jacket would get the chicks. I
was so naive that I even bought a
black marker with which to high-
light my books.

Sophomore year. My second year
was a year of "deviance and fun.
When I moved in nextldoor to the
resident assistant, who happened to
be a good friend from home, he had
no idea what he was in for.

Little did my RA know that he
would be strolling home in 20 degree
weather from a fraternity party in
his underwear and mooning pedes-
trians from the Forbes Quad over-
pass. And little did he know that
when he appointed me fire marshal,
I would tell everyone, “Sure the ele-
vator works during fire drills, you’ve
just got to push the button a lot
longer."

What do you mean animals in the

Towers? There was absolutely no

sign of rats, snakes, cats, gerbils or
turtles on my floor. But you should
have seen the expression on the faces
of incoming freshmen when they
were given a tour of my ﬂoor.
“Shriek! Oh my God, it’s.alive!"

I guess they were referring to the
cockroaches.

There are many things for which I
must apologize that were the result
of my sophomore year's ill-
mannered behavior: I'm sorry for
pennviniz in all the people I did
(sorry Steve, I didn‘t know that
woman was your grandmother),

toilet paper from the top three floors

the elevator controls and not allow-
ing people to get off—-even when
they had to go to the bathroom so
bad, turning the water fountain into
“Old Faithful” and telling my ﬂoor-
mates at frat parties that most girls
get turned on when you grasp their
buttocks.

O.K., so I was a bit immature, but
I had a hell of a lot of fun.

I also declared a major that year-—
English writing. Me? A writer? I had
trouble spelling my social security
number, let alone my name. I
thought I’d never make it.

Junior year. A year of experience.
I still couldn't believe I was main-
taining a 3.0 QPA. Something was
bound to go wrong—and it did. I
became a staff writer at the illus-
trious Pitt News.

From organizations to varsity
athletics, I soon learned that a por-
tion of the day must be set aside to
breathe.

Graduated from fraternity
parties—it was the bar scene now. I
realized that if I blew off several days
of class, the world wouldn't end.
And never sleep on the top bunk
when your roommate has a steady,
active girlfriend.

Senior, year. An accumulation of
all the best times of the previous
three years. I became football beat
reporter and took advantage of all of
it. No more braving the elements
and drunkards—I had a press box
seat. I thought it was the greatest
thing untirl got reprimanded for
cheering.

After being appointed news edi-
tor, I realized that there was much
truth in the motto “You are born,
you work for The Pitt News, then
you die.”

I knew I was busy when I had to

All in all, from rapping with the
chancellor to mud wrestling, my
senior year was probably the best of
all my years.

I must thank several individuals
who have tolerated me for the last
several years and have helped me
keep my sanity on late deadline
nights.

First, I must thank my editor, Ms.
Clinton, for providing an ally in
whom to place all the blame.

I thank the copy desk for making
my articles literate and error free-
they almost make me sound
intelligent. '

The sports desk I thank for per-
mitting me to fly all over the globe,
expenses paid. I especially thank
Barry and Scott for proving to the
world that there are bigger unorgan-
ized messes than myself.

I thank the typists for putting up
with all of my cursing when the
headline machine jammed.

I thank the paste-up peons for
permitting me to make a nuisance of
myself.

Killer, Clubber, Dave, .I.F. and
Jim for being my personal answer-
ing service and punching bags on
which to vent my frustrations.

Paul Correa, the only tenured stu-
dent, for filling voids with SGB
epics.

Wes Cotter, for giving me practice
on spelling and editing skills.

And my parents, for footing the

‘bill for four years and putting up

with me all my life.

My years at Pitt were interesting,
exciting and a fantastic learning
experience. My only regret is that I
graduated in four years.

plans for himself after graduation.

 To Conversing And Learning In Laundromats...

By JIM KANE

Since I am graduating sometime this
summer, and this is my last semester work-
ing at The Pitt News, my editor asked me to
do a column about college life. I sat back and
thought about what I could say that might
be interesting. Of course, I thought about
the beer parties, bar hops and late papers. I
even considered doing a column about the
different classes we all take that have
nothing to do with anything.

Trivial, I finally decided. Beer parties and
strange classes were actually a small part of
my college career. Any good conversation in
a bar is usually forgotten the next day, and

the only thing people do in class is sleep or
try to make sense of what the teacher is
saying. There is something more important
to college than beer and books, and that is
the laundromat.

lt’s hard not to meet people in a
laundromat—or even in the dorms. How-

ever, if you have ever gone to the laundro-

mats in South Oakland you may know what
I mean. People from all over the world use
the laundromats in South Oakland. Stu-
dents also use the laundromats in South

Oakland and, I would guess, those in North

Oakland, too.
_ If you are even slightly outgoing, you can
find out about other countries and social

customs. You can find out how the foreign
students feel about living and going to
school in America. You can make new
friends in a laundromat, and you can even
meet long-lost cousins while doing laundry,
as I once did.

You’re probably thinking to yourself that

, I’m crazy and that you've never met anyone

in a laundromat. That could be the case in
both instances, but there is more to my idea
than only laundromats. Sure, you can meet

people from all over in a laundromat—but»

you can also meet people from other walks
and areas of life by going to college. I think
that this is perhaps one of the most impor-
tant aspects of college we can utilize; the

...To The College Book OfLists...

By MARY KANE

Since lists are in—The Book of
Lists, Who’s Who lists, Franz
Liszt—-it's only fitting to write a
graduation column in a list form.

But keep in mind that for some
people, graduation is like death; the
subject’s often discussed but
nothing’s ever done about it.

For this conditonal graduation
column, then, the following lists are
in order:

Things I wish I ’d done

Iinterrupted a campus tour of
prospective students to yell, “Don’t
do it! Get out while you can!”

Ostarted a campaign to prevent
the cruel commercial takeover of
Gustine’s by C.J. Barney’s. The
theme could center around the pres-
ervation of “Early Bedspring” decor,
such as the kind exhibited in the
bar’s Backroom.

Opushed for director of Student .
Activities Andy Smith to assume
editorial responsibilities at The Pitt
News, thereby ensuring an overflow
of University P.R..

Ocalled in fake obituaries to the
local papers in retaliation for the
times they beat The Pitt News on
university-related stories.

Osigned into the dorms the names
of Charles Manson, David Stock-
man, Debbie Harry and Prince-
and all to one room-just to see if

gram the workings of a nuclear
power plant. '

...To Preventing Insanity

By SCOTT REX

I’ve waited for this moment for a
few years; my last column as an
undergraduate. Mostly I’ve written
to prevent my insanity. Occasionally
I've written to provoke others into
response. Regardless of reason, it’s
been fun. So, what's the big lesson of
college? Learn to enjoy a good cup
of black coffee.

Seriously speaking, I guess we
each draw our own conclusions
about college. In the past four years
we have witnessed numerous histori-
cal events. Our trauma triggered by
the revolution in Iran. The Falkland
Island War. The attempted assassi-
nations of the Pope and President
Reagan. The ClA’s activities in Cen-
tral America, etc., etc. These years
have been anythingbut quiet.

I’ve tried to get students to think
about certain political issues. The
arms race, the United States involve-
ment in El Salvador. NATO and our
relations with Israel. I leave the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh disappointed
that the major topic of discussion
this semester was the name of a
building. Me, I never read those arti-
cles. I could care about U.S. money
helping to kill innocent citizens but I
can not care about the name of a
building.

I could cite the name of the stu-
dents who continually wrote for
these opinion pages. All five to seven
of them. Five to seven out of a stu-
dent body of 30,000_. This campus is
not politically healthy. That is a
serious problem. But I have come to
realize that my critique will change
nothing. Maybe ifthe United States

started drafting students for a war in

Central E America ~thin_gs' -would * ' ' ' ' ' ' '

-I « hopes to attenctgraduate s|c:hga{,K,.. .

change, but that remains to be seen.

I’ve thought about writing this
article for the past month. Here it is
one hour past deadline and I still
don’t know how a last article is writ-
ten. How do you capture four years
of your life in 10 inches of paper? My
advice would be meaningless, after
all I rarely listen to myself. But I do
have a few parting thoughts, which
are as follows:

Self praise is cheap, avoid this at
all cost. Good friends are hard to
come by. Political apathy is alive
and well at Pitt. The arms race will
continue. The Greens will lead riots
this summer in West Germany. The
U.S. will become ever more involved
in Central America. I support no
terrorist organization. Man killing
man is a sin, unless we’re discussing
World War 11. America has not
come to grip with our defeat in Viet-
nam. The Soviet Union is not ready
to collapse. I pray that we avoid a
nuclear showdown, I doubt that we
will.

Most of all I wish that the coffee
plants in Central America were not
sprayed by toxic chemicals. I hate
thinking about getting cancer
because of coffee. I never liked
drinking -coffee before Pitt. I hope
that I don't have to tell my grand-
children that college gave me cancer.
My last and only advice is found in
words of Bob Dylan. “Don’t follow
leaders and’ watch your parking
meters.” Students may come and
students may go but the pens of the
meter maids will never run dry.

created much controversy this term,

seem silly, it is realistic and provides a good

Spikers Surprise Rutgers; Prepare For Rematcihi  

By MARK A. SINDLER

A milestone of sorts was accomp-
lished Saturday at Trees Hall. It
might not go down in the annals of
Pitt sports history, but it was a note-

’yorthy event nonetheless.

The Pitt volleyball squad enter-
tained Rutgers at l p.m. fora league
match and came away with a four-
game victory. The match win
marked the first time in its ﬁve-year
existence that the Panthers have
defeated a Top l0 team.

By CHARLIE O'HARA

There were high hopes surround-
ing Panther gymnast Dave Smith's
trip to State College, Pa., for the

, NCAA championships, for which he

qualified in the floor exercise.

He believed that if he received a
good draw, he would stand a chance
of advancing to the finals.

Despite the fact that he didn't get
any help in the draw—-he competed
fourth in his twelve man rotation—
Smith failed to reach his goal-the
finals.

“I needed a score of 9.6 to qualify
for the final round and I had a 9.3,"
Smith said. “My draw wasn’t the
best that I could have hoped for but I
don't think it made much difference.

“The level of competiton was

’“much higher-it was Olympic com-

petition. Four of the six guys on the
‘80 Olympic team competed in the
meet. The scores were ridiculous. In
one event there was a three-way tie
for first with 9.9. A perfect 10 was
the winning score on the side horse.”

Despite the fact that he fell short
of the finals for the third straight

Avenging an earlier loss on the
Scarlet Knights’ home court in late

February, the Panthers handed the.

New Jersey-based school its fourth
loss of its season, 15-7, 11-15, 16-14,
16-14.

For coach Ray the

Reilly,

moment was just right for the under-‘

dog Panthers tocome through in the
clutch.

“It's probably the best thing that's
happened to this program in five
years,“ the fourth-year skipper said.
“lt's the first Top 10 team we’ve
beaten in five years, and it comes at a

year, Smith believes this past week-
end was a learning experience.

“I iearned a lot—there are quite a
few new tricks that I plan on bring-
ing back to the gym," he said. “The
level of difficulty has increased tre-
mendously in the past year. UCLA
had a bad meet and still totalled over
280. Nebraska and Penn State are
two outstanding teams.” They both
scored over 280. Nebraska finished
with 287, easily capturing its fifth
consecutive national title.

The future of the Panther gym-
nastics program appears to be
headed in the direction of Nebras-
ka‘s, Penn States and UCLA's. But
with standards of qualification and
competition rapidly increasing in
the NCAA, it makes it even more
difficult because the improvement
over a single season must be vast-—
the more established programs are
bringing in talent every year. Com-
petition for the NCAA meet.

The Panthers finished the '83 sea-
son ranked l4th,iwhich is quite an
accomplishment for a program that
is only six years old, but their next
step will be the toughest one. The

team broke the 270-point barrier, a '

good time——right before the
playoffs.”
Saturday's match was quite typi-
cal of Pitt's previous play during the
season. The match featured the
usual close games that the Panthers
have been caught up in against the
better-established squads. Those
have been matches in which the
Panthers have played and usually
ended up losing after the opposition
mounted a fierce comeback.
Against Rutgers, though, Pitt
held its own, but for reasons which
escape Reilly. There was nothing

alify

school record, this season, but it will

take scores in the high 270s or low
2805 by next season to qualify for
NCAA’s.

Next season, the team believes it
should be in contention for an
NCAA berth; only l0 teams in the
country qualify. They believe that
they stand a shot at competing with

g Penn State. l

With the strides made this season,
there is hope, but it will come down
to how much more the team is able
to improve after this season. With’
many freshmen returning, scores
should go up almost automatically,
but with the loss to graduation of
experienced talent like Chris Femi-
ani and Mike Lloyd, additional
spots on the roster must be filled.

PITT NOTES: The team will have
an additional aide in their corner for
next season. Pitt will install a new‘
safety feature that will underlie all
the gymnastics apparatus. The new
safety feature, in use at many
schools already, will enable the team
to work on much more risky rou-
tines and tricks in practice without
the worry of injury.

Panthers Sneak

By Duquesne“  

By TIM DINGERL

The Panther tennis team evened
its record at 4-4 by squeaking past

the Duquesne Dukes 5-4 yesterday

at the Trees Hall courts.

Going into the doubles matches,
the score was tied 3-3. Pitt’s No. 3
team of Dave Kortyna and Jay
Petras had just beaten Duquesne 6-

.4, 6-4, but the No. 2 doubles match

went to Duquesne, as Steve Greco
and Jeff Mott whipped Panthers
Larry Lederer and Jack Warwick 6-
0, 6-2. This evened the score at 4-4
and set up the finale between Pitt’s
No. 1 team of James McDonald and
D.J. Mariano and Duquesne’s
Whitny Snyder and Bob Vertes.
Snyder and Vertes won the first
set 7-6, winning the tie-breaker 7-5.
The second set went into a tie-
breaker also, but -this time the
Panthers came out on top, 7-3 to win

’ the set 6-7.

They had an easier time with the
Dukes in the third set, winning 6-4 to
clinch the team win. —

“It was a great comeback and the
crucial point of the match,” said ten-
nis coach George Dieffenbach of the
final match. “They played hard-
nosed, aggressive tennis when they

were down. When they were up, it I

was all over.

“It was a Mariano and Kortyna
story,” he continued. “Between the
two of them, they scored four of our
five points. They really pulled
through.”

different in the Panthers‘_ play that
stood out in comparison to matches
against similarly-strong teams.

“There was nothing special,”
Reilly said of the Rutgers’ win. “Ev-
erybody just played well; we‘ve been
playing Top 10 teams to the point . . .
point for point with them when it’s
been 13-13 or I2-12 and just haven't
had—I don’t know what you want to
call it—the guts or the experience to
win at that point. - ~ _

“But it happened twice——both
games were tied at 14-14 and we won
them . something we've never
done before.”

Junior Mike Petock described the ,

team's play against Rutgers as bring-
ing together the entire roster—a ros-
ter all the members of which saw
action.

“We just started playing like we're
supposed to," Petock said. “The
points we gave them were all our
own mistakes. In the game we lost,
wemade a lot of mistakes-that's
how they were scoring their points.
They really weren't making their
own breaks; [Rutgers] was capitaliz-
ing on our mistakes.”

The victory, Reilly admitted, put
his players into “a very good frame
of mind" as it prepares for a Penn
State encounter tomorrow evening.
“We've gone to double figures with
them but haven't had the guts to win
the match," Reilly said of his team's
play against the Lions this season.

Winning the match against a Penn
State or any other top-caliber team
has been a chronic back pain for the
Panthers all year. By beating
Rutgers, setter Dave Baird said,
“Pitt improved its posture from the
hunch-like positioil that has
afflicted the team most of the past
four months.

He continued, “It's been a long

" time coming for one thing. We've _
come closeto [Rutgers] a lotof V V

tie-breaker at the No. 2 singles spot.

At the No. 5 position, Kortyna
became the second Panther to regis-
ter a double win by hammering Rob
Vertes 6-4, 6-0.

In other singles matches, at the
No. 1 position, Duque.sne’s Snyder
beat Pitt’s James McDonald 7-5, 6-4
to drop McDonald's record to 5-3.

In the No. 3 spot, Duke Jeff’Mott
had to go three sets to put. Pitt's
Lederer away 2-6, 6-2. 6-4.

At the No. 6 spot, Roberto San
Gabriel of Duquesne beat Pitt’s Jay
Petras 7-6, 6-3 to tie the team match
at 3-3, setting up the doubles battle
to decide the match. ‘

“They have a first class team,”

said Dieffenbach. “They have very «

good guys. All their players are re-

cruited. I'm really happy with some

of the performances today.”

With the Panther record at 4-4,
the squad will prepare to «take on
Slippery Rock State College tomor-
row at Slippery Rock.

“They have ,a very competitive
team,” said Dieffenbach. “They beat
us last year, 5-2. What we're going to
do is work hard tomorrow, which
won't be too hard after a win like
this. Our goal is to break .500.” ‘

times—usually ﬁve games-—so‘ it
was nice. People were playing with a
little more confidence; everybody
really contributed and nobody pan-

icked at the end, which is what we
usually do. — »

“We did everything we were sup-
posed to,” Baird added. “We served
smart and the defense was pretty
good. Overall, ‘everything was con-
sistent. We deserved to win for sure.
It wasn't like [Rutgers] gave us
anything.” -

Petock offered similar sentiments,
saying there were no passing
breakdowns—“the kinds that have
hurt us in the past,” he added. “We
kept our composure throughout the
whole match and just played our
own game."

GAME SERVES: Pitt couldn't

have started “playing its own game”,
at a more opportune time; the ECVL
playoffs commence this weekend;
although Reilly expects his squad to
finish second in the division, he
hopes the team can even make it,'let
alone place well; the Panthers mav
have to forego the playoffs since its

timing conﬂicts with players’ final

exams; Reilly won't know till near

the end of the week whether his 10-

man roster will make the trip to East

Stroudsburg, N.J., or Boston—one

of two possible playoff sites . . . the
Rutgers win upped the Panther’s
seasonal match record to l8-l3-1 . . .

after starting him at last weekend's
Ball State Classic and in every game
against Rutgers, Reilly said fresh-
man Kevin Hood “was kind of a
shining star on Saturday" and said
he played an integral part of Reilly's
offense . . . calling the win “a total
team effort,” Reilly used his entire
roster in beating the Scarlet l§ni_gh_t§.

Some Solutions To A Soggy Problem

By scon DELLETT

The Pittsburgh area is being
repaid for the wonderful weather of
a month ago. Instead of sunny skies,
this area has been drenched with
rain, rain and still more rain.

Needless to say, the Pitt baseball
team has not been able to play one
game since returning from Florida
two weeks ago. The problem—rain.
And when it hasn’t rained, Trees
Field has not been able to dry out.

With finals coming up this week,
playing time is certainly restricted.
After ﬁnals, the Panthers have three
weeks to finish their season, not an

enjoyable task—especially when’

four double-headers" have to be
rescheduled.

So as a public service to the base-
ball team, out crack team of
researchers have looked into this

problem- Here are their solutions.

0 Use a tarpaulin——the main prob-
lem Trees Field has——and anyone
who has played baseball realizes
suclr—is the infield is all dirt. And
when rain hits dirt, you know what
comes out-—-mud.

A tarp would keep the infield rela-
tively dry, giving the Pitt ground
crew a chance to prepare the field
and the Panthers a chance to play.

0 Replace Trees Field’s grass with
Astroturf—Artifical turf is easier to
take care of. All a grounds crew
would have to do is suck up the
water and hours later—a relatively
dry field.

Even though installing Astroturf
is expensive, all that is needed is the
original cost and there’s a field
which can be used for I0 years or
more. And Pitt could get more base-
ball games in.

‘ 0Play at Pitt Stadium——So artifi-
al turf is expensive—-Pitt Stadium

has that stuff. One plus one equals
two, right?

Why not move the games to the
stadium? After all, there’s no
expense—a scoreboard would not

. have to be installed and only a few

cosmetic changes would be needed
on the turf.

Pitt Stadium can be tailored to the
team’s strength. Due to the design of
the playing area, either the right or
left field will be shorter than usual.
Just think of the home runs that
could be hit.

Home runs would be a great pro-
motion for the Sports lnformataion
Office. If Pitt baseball could average
over 10,000 fans a game, the move
would certainly be worth it. Besides,
the football team can hold spring
practice at Trees Field.

0 Put a dome over Pitt Stadium——
just think of the money that could be
brought in. The initial investment

Despite the windy, rainy weather
conditions, the Panther track team
performed with determination while
recording some excellent early sea-
son times and placements at the
Dogwood Relays at the University
of Tennessee this past weekend.

The sprint medley team of Ricky
Asberry, Brian Pollock, Mario
Joyner and Terry Gallagher placed
first while setting a school record
time of 3221.4. Gallagher ran the

‘£500-meter anchor leg in a blistering

time by any of the Panthers all year

long.

In the I500-meter run, Bill Moor-
head finished second (315 I .4) getting
nipped at the wire after having led
the race from the start. In the trial
run the previous night, Moorhead
ran the distance in 3:47.

“If the weather wasn't as bad as it
was on Saturday, Bil1’s time would
probably have been faster, Panther
coach John Vasvary said. “It was so
windy and the rain didn’t help much
either." . ‘

The distance medley team of Pol-
lock, Darren Geary, Garland Brown

and Todd Colas finished third ‘

/

(9:40.4) against several of the finest
teams in the nation. Eastern Michi-

_ gan won, but the Panthers were able

to defeat conference rival Villanova,
who placed sixth.

Brown finished fifth in the 800-
meter run with a time of l:49.7,
defeating national qualifer John
Marshall of Villanova. Colas didn’t
place in the event but ran a respecta-
ble time of 1250.7.

Despite their lack of placement
due to the outstanding competition,
several other Panthers also per-
formed well.

many baseball observers question
the strength of this division.

BALTIMORE: Joe Altobelli and
Leo Hernandez have a lot in com-
mon this spring. They both find
themselves in new surroundings
where legends have been clearly
established.

As the manager of the Orioles,
Altobelli follows Earl Weaver, who
won six Eastern Division titles, four
American League Championships
and one World Series during his 14-
1/2 years as manager.

Hernandez, a 23 year-old rookie
who split time last season on Char-
lotte (AA) and Rochester minor
league rosters is seeking to take over
at third base, which was manned last
year by Rookie Of The Year Cal
Ripken and by Hall of Fame legend
Brooks Robinson for 20 years
before that.

Baltimore has the edge based on
the depth of its pitching staff. How-
ever, Mike Flanagan and Scott
McGregor will have to rebound

Darryl Shepherd, who advanced to
the semi-finals, ran a 14.6 in the face
of a fierce wind. Ralph Mitton triple
jumped 47’ which bettered his jump
of a week ago by two inches. Finally,
Pollock and Joyner ran 53.3 and
53.6, respectively, while failing to
place in the 400-meter intermediate
hurdles.

The times that were expected to
drop prior to the meet did. The

distance people are proving that

reckoned. With a week off for ﬁnals
and an open date the following
weekend (April 23)the Panthers are
next scheduled to compete on April
30 when they will travel to the Penn
Relays. The Big East Outdoor Con-

'ference Championships on May 6

will be the first time that the entire
team will make a trip together.

“The team is shaping up the way
we felt that it could prior to the start
of the season," Vasvary said. “We

The travel posters extol the Calsbria
_ region outside Naples. Behind the counter
hangs a poster of the 1982 World Cup
championship soccer team. A stack of fly-
ers advertises a bake sale by the Pitt Italian
Club. And presiding over it all is NapoIi‘s
trademark, the statue of the‘ rotund chef
with a mustache, pizza pan outstretched to
advertise “the real Italian touch.”

Nspoli’s tomato sauce had a low quo-
tient of common Italian spices, but few
restaurants go to such lengths to advertise
their Italian roots.

And no one serves bigger pizza cuts. I
ordered my customary half-hosgie and
two cuts of pizza, but had to leave part of it

The pizza cuts are 75 cents each, a price
that should have tipped me to their size:
roughly eight inches wide, 10 or 12 inches
long and about %-inch thick. The doughy
consistency ‘and the cheesy ilavor are dif-
ferent from most Pittsburgh pizzas - and I
can‘t quite pinpoint what makes Napo|i‘s
special. Call it a subject for future reseach.

The oven-baked hoagle was delicious,
although,‘ like the pizza it wasn't spicy
enough to suit me. The hoagie had a fresh
spongy meatball, mild tomato sauce and
melted mozarella running down the sides
of the bread. The sauce even had a fugitive
mushroom in it, matching the onion that
somehow found its way into the pizza.
Both were welcome additions.

Pitt students and hospital staff are
apparently the main clientele at Napoli‘s.
On a rainy afternoon all II ,tables were
occupied, several of them by customers
waiting near the counter for their orders.

MILWAUKEE: Pardon Brewer’s
general manager Harry Dalton if he
is unable to savor a magnificent 1982
season, in which he fell one game
short of winning it all.

In the course of six months, Dal-
ton has watched _ two Cy Young
Award winners, both of who he
acquired in the same pivotal trade,
go’ down withsore arms.

So it is that the Brewers mightiest
offensive team in the AL since the
1961 Yankees will go about the busi-
ness'of defending its pennant with-
out the services of Pete Vuckovich,
the ace starter, and Rollie Fingers,

be expected to be very competitive.
Their lineup, including such explo-
sive sluggers as Robin Yount, Cecil
Cooper, Gorman Thomas and Paul
Molitor is going to score a load of
runs~—that will compensate for the
times the Brew Crew hurlers won't
pitch their best games. ' .

NEW YORK: Who's on first?
Who’s at short? What's the starting
rotation? When will manager Billy
Martin have his first confrontation
with owner George Steinbrenner?

These are questions that the Yan-
kees have yet to completely resolve.

lack of starting (pitching is going to
hurt them in the long run.

Sure Rich “Goose“ Lioosage will
make his share of appearances out of
the bullpen this season, but aside
from Ron Guidry, the starting staff
is still a big question mark.

Unless the Yankees’ management
swings a trade to give manager Billy
Martin some pitchers, it could be a
frustrating year.

BOSTON: The Red Sox will have-
the most solid outﬁeld in baseball
this year with Jim Rice (24 HRS, 97
RBI), Tony Armas (28 HRS, 97
RBI) and Dwight Evans (32 HRs, 98
RBI).

Another strength of the Sox is
that they are deep in the bullpen with

CLEVELAND: The last Cleve-

The last Cleveland team to finish
second was 1959. Since then, only
one Cleveland team has finished as
high as third.

This is just some of the history
that faces rookie manager Mike
Ferraro.

Consequently, with all the odds

against Ferraro to succeed, he has _

plenty of optimism. The effervescent
former-Yankee coach is not known
to go down without a fight. Just as
Ferraro was packing to go to spring

lem that required emergency
surgery. Ferraro hopes to set an
example to this players on how to
bounce back from adversity. Two
weeks after surgery, he rejoined the
Tribe.

A great deal of Ferraro’s positive
outlook about his ballclub comes
from a surpisingly strong pitching
staff.

In Len Barker, a recovered Bert
Blyleven, Rick Sutcliffe, Larry
Sorensen and impressive rookie
Neal Heaton, the Indians believe
their starting rotation is as good as
any in baseball.

TORONTO: The team from
North of the Border is probably the
most interesting in the AL this year.
One of the reasons is that it has an
excellent nucleus of young pitchers.

Blue Jays’ management shelled

out almost $5 million this winter to

sign Dave Stieb and Jim Clancy to

long-term contracts.

However, manager Bobby‘ Cox
hopes that his club, last in the AL in
hitting a year ago, can develop some
hitters this year.

The American League West is so
evenly matched this winter that the
ﬂip of a coin could pick the winner.

CHICAGO: This should be an
exciting year for entrepreneurs Jerry
Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, who
have taken one of the worst organi-
zations in baseball and turned it
around in the relatively short time of
three years.

The major change took ‘place
when the two owners came in‘,
purchased the club from Bill Veeck
and let one of the most underrated
general managers, Roland Hemond,

run the baseball end of the
operations. It was. Hemond who
went out and traded for Vance Law,
Rudy Law, Tony Bernazard, Jerry
Koosman, Dennis Lamp and Tom
Paciorek and has been very liberal to
the player when contract talks have
arisen.

The Sox added Floyd Bannister
by way of the free-agent route this
winter to an already strong staff that
includes I9-game winner Britt
Burns. Chicago is very deep in the
bullpen. with Dick Tidrow, Steve
Mura, Salome Barojas and Jim
Kern.

In Florida this spring at the Sox
camp, rumors were flying around
that if the club doesn’t get off to a
good start, manager Tony LaRussa,
who is in his fourth season, would be
ﬁred. One likely candidate to replace

LaRussa would be former Phillies
skipper Danny Ozark.

KANSAS ClTY——The Royals are
still rebounding from last season,
which showed off-field conflicts,
that in turn led to problems on the
diamond.

It all began last summer when
manager Dick Howser and batting
coach Rocky Colovito got involved
in a tussle with police outside Royal
Stadium. .

Then there was George Brett, the
toast of baseball just two years ago
when he ﬂirted with a .400 batting

average.

Brett, apparently dissatisﬁed with
his $1 million-a-year salary,
brooded most of last year when he,
too, got little sympathy from
Royals’ ownership in his demands

for a lifetime contract.

The bet is that all those off-field
problems won't arise this year and
that the Royals will be in the race.

CALIFORNIA---Aside from the
departure of veteran swinger Don
Baylor to the Yankees, this is
basically the same club that blew the
playoffs to Milwaukee last year.
That miscue cost manager Gene
Mauch his job and ex-Cincinnati
skipper John McNamara has come
to Anaheim with hopes of capturing
the Al West pennant.

A shaky bullpen, especially from
the right side, and a shallow bench
are what will probably hold this club
back from repeating.

SEATTLE~This is a club that
features 44-year old future Hall of
Famer Gaylord Perry and two key
players, shortstop Todd Cruz and
outfielder Al Cowens, who were
both picked up on waivers. Richie
Zisk’s swing is tailored for the
Kingdome. The problem this club
faces—aside from Jim Beattie, Perry
and fastballer Bill Caudill, one of the
most underrated relief specialists in
the game—is a lack of pitching. The
Mariners are on the right track;
owner George Agryos has made a

commitment to a young manager in
Rene Lachemann, and the Seattle
farm system is developing some very
good talent. Look for the Mariners
to play the spoiler role this year.
OAKLAND—-Steve Boros
replaces.Billy Martin as the manager
of the A's this year. All ofa sudden,
those brilliant young pitchers
Martin had a couple of years ago
have sore arms, but Rickey
Henderson, Dwayne Murphy and
promising rookie Mike Davis will be
exciting trio of outfielders to watch.
Carney Lansford, who is
returning home from the Red Sox,
will probably hit better than .300
this year, and Boros will have to get
a lot of mileage out of his bullpen
with Dave Beard and veteran Tom

Burgmeier if the A‘s plan to compete’

in the division.

TEXAS—What can you say
about a club that unloads pitchers
like Dave Rightetti, Gene Nelson,
Tommy Boggs, Len Barker and
Rick Waits. These are all quality
hurlers.

The Rangers have always had
talent, they haven’t utilized
properly. They are finally starting to
build a foundation for the future by

turning over the operations aspect of

the club to former farm director Joe

Klien.

Klien replaced Eddie Robinson as
general manager, and Doug Rader
was brought in as manager. He has
been known for his practicaljokes as
a player and brought some of his
loose philosophies as a manager
with him to the Rangers.

The key to the Rangers success
will be patience with George Wright,
Bobby Johnson, Dave Hostetler,
Peter O’Brien, Danny Darwin and
Ron Musselman—the young
players who have potential.

Another important factor to the
Ranger’s gaining some respectabil-
ity this year will be how Mickey
Rivers comes back from injuries that
sidelined him last year.

Rivers and Buddy Bell are capable
of causing opposing pitchers plenty
of problems.

MINNEa0TA—What can you
say about this team that is positive?
Owner Calvin Griffith is an
embarrassment to the game of
baseball.
