Writer Finds Amity
In Hull Reciprocal
Trade Agreements

By JOSEPH McCLOSKEY

\Vhat program shall th e
United States subscribe to in
order to further the cause of
peace? Shall we abandon our
traditional isolationism and
embark upon a course of inter-
national cooperation? Or shall
we remain true to tradition and
forget about world peace, striving
only to keep the United States out
of the next war?

If we concede the inevitability
of another general war in Europe,
then the latter plan is obviously
best for America, for we could
hope to gain nothing more than

'we did in the Great War, and

would stand an excellent chance
of losing much more should we
become involved again.

But, is another war as inevit-
able as it appears? France is
economically prostrate; Germany
and Italy are absorbed in the con-
solidation of their newly-formed
empires. ‘ _.

England fears for her life-line
in the event of war with Italy or
any other Mediterranean power;
Russia is hampered by political in-
stability; and Japan is ﬁnding
that China is far more difficult a
conquest than she had expected.
Picking Sides

Further, the present network of
treaties, agreements, and under-
standings makes the task of pick-
ing sides in the next war almost
impossible. England
Russia through France. At the
sametime, she is tied to Germany
through Italy. The latter axis
extends -to Japan. France is con-
sidering an agreement with Italy.
The network may be expanded
indeﬁnitely.

Thus, while war may get under
way in Europe at most any time,
there is still reason to believe that
war is not inevitable. And so, what
role shall the United States as-
sume? A

Part of that answer is already
being formulated. The Hull re-
ciprocal trade agreements are pav-
ing the way for commercial amity
throughout the world—and much
of the present discontent, espec-
ially among the “have-not” na-
tions is due to commercial strang-
ulation. Germany is not striving
for self-sufficiency because of
choice, but because of necessity:
world markets have been closed to
Germany. If the Hull program is
carried to its logical conclusion,
such discrimination will disap-
pear.

Cause Not Hopeless

When such a network of agree-
ments is added to the already ex-
isting postal and extradition
treaties and is reinforced by a
powerful and well-organized labor
movement intent upon peace, the
cause for peace does not appear
I,1',early so hopeless. ‘

And what role can we, as stu-
dents, play? By analyzing the
dauses of war, by refusing to be
swayed by headlines and brass
bands, and by striving for the ex-
tension of the existing forces for
peace, we can move a long way
in our generation toward the elim-
ination of war.

But above all, we must remem-
ber that the idea of peace is a new
one, scarcely a century old, and
we must not become discouraged
by lack of unamimity of opinion
on the part of peace advocates or
by the apparent failure of such
instruments for peace as the
League of Nations.

to attend the remainder of ‘the’
week’s educational events. Ac-
cording to Betty Bierer, Ed38,
chairman for the activities, both

true, uncamouﬂaged facts on
syphilis and tuberculosis, and
their cures and preventatives.

Cass To Leave
University  
F or Wisconsin ,

Carl B, Cass, director of dra-
rnatics and assistant professor in
spee-ch, will not return to the Uni-
versity next year, according to a
letter he has presented to Univer-
sity authorities. 1

Mr. Cass, who has been teach-
ing in summer sessions ‘at the
University of Wisconsin, asked for
a leave of absence in orderto ac-
cept a graduate assistantship at;
Wisconsin that would enable him7
to work for his -doctorate. If the
leave of absence is denied, how-
ever, he will resign from the fac-
ulty.

The departure of‘l\/Ir. Cass .will
mark an almost complete deple-
tion of the speech department.‘-
Within the past two years, three
other members either resignedor‘
were dropped by the administra-
tion.“ ,

‘In May, 1936, Richard Murphy,
instructor in speech and debating.
coach, was not ten_dere,d,a contract
for the next year. 'Dr‘."Wayland

department, incensed - over‘ ‘ this

Theresa Kahn, another member of,
the department, resigned ‘a' year
later to marry. V '. 3

_VVith Cass’ absence,lthe former
speech department is reduced to

tor in speech, who was imported a
year ago from Huntington, W. Va.

If the leave of absence is not
denied, Mr. Cass’ desire to return
hinges upon certain changes in the
physical set-up for dramatics. He
advocates: a rehearsal room and
stage facilities made available for
Pitt Players and his play produc-
tion class. . .

L CAME FROM WISCONSIN

~ Mr.~Cass came to the University
in 1930 after he‘.had directed dra-'
matics and speech at Mercersburg
academy and received his master’s
degree at,Wi.sconsin. He spent his
undergraduate years at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. .

"As“ director of Pitt Players, _he
will present, his last show, “Ac-
cent on Yduth,” ‘ Monday A and
Tuesday evenings, May 2 and 3, in
the Stephen C. Foster Memorial.
Mr. Cass also directed the last
two Cap and Gown shows, “Trail-
er, Ho!” and “Pickets, Please!”

While at the University, he was
tapped into membership in Druids
and Omicron Delta Kappa, sopho-
more and senior activities honora-
ries, and Theta Alpha Phi, hon-
orary dramatics fraternity.

Below follows the complete text
of Mr. Cass’ “conditional resigna-
tion” letter:

Dye Announces
Alternate Car  
Parking Places

Correction of a false impression
as to parking in Schenley park
plaza was made

ne reiterated his statclment “It
"Jas done forthe students’ own
welfare.”

Inspector Dye stated that he had
posted traffic policemen in the
Schenley park plaza to warn the

v students that if they parked in the

plaza they would be hemmed in
by the eight lanes of cars parking
for the baseball game in the after-
noon.
1 Alternate parking place, along-
side the Carnegie_ library, wads
suggested, as studen.ts,‘would be
able to ‘driveout at any time.'P'o-
licemen were posted only to notify
the students of the alternate park-
ing space created." A
Dye repeated his statement: “It’s
for the good of the students. In
the past they have parked their
cars and then when they were
ready to leave they would ﬁnd
them buried behind four others.
They had to Wait until‘ the base-
ball game was over before they

could get out.” - ~

He also added emphatically,
“Downtown papers gave the wrong
interpretation. There was no
parking ‘regulation;’ it was ia

‘parking ‘recommendation.’ ”

Peace Mobilization
Called For Today

LTHOUGH the hours will be officially
shortened for the assembly today at 11 :30
o'clock. and no cuts will be handed out—We
prefer to call the meeting an “anti-war
strike.” _

‘The emphasis on the name is not -mere quib-
bling on word choice but an indication of the
fundamental meaning behind this day.

For several years during the last week of
April, at 11 o’clock, assemblies, demonstrations,
discussions ,class cutting and soap box oratory
have taken place all over America, sponsored
by the universities and student groups like the
Y’s, National Council of Methodist Youth,
American Youth Congress, the American Stu-
dent Union, et cetera.

Last year, about 500,000 students devoted
one hour to thinking about the vital problem of
how not to be cannon fodder.

The difference between the meetings on ‘this
day of April 27 and those peace _discussions
held the rest of the year is that;this""d_ay is"a
day of protest.—against militaristic foreign pol-
icy, against the war machine, against doing
and dieing for foreign investments in general.

A But more iniportaiit—there may come a time
in America when young people will have need
of more than discussion, when we may be call-
'e‘d”upon’perl1aps to “come through for the
Philippines,” or to again make the world safe
for -democracy.

‘And if we remember the bitter disillusion of
the last war for similar causes, the futility of
all war—what' are we going to do to show our
disinclination to lie underneath the poppies or
cherry blossoms?

The nation-wide demonstrations are, there
fore, a significant means of protect. Five hun-
dred thousand students might make their com-
bined voices heard above the drums and bu-
gles. 0

Today is more than another holiday in our
lives. A '

It is a crisis.

WAA Health Program

Merits Attendance

WOh'lEN’S Athletic Association, through its

llealtli \Veek program is offering the stu-
dents of the University a liberal education that
no course on campus has ever been able to
equal. It is offering information on practical
living that no one can afford to miss.

Yet, in spite of the satisfactory commenda-
tion on those who attended the meetings earlier
this week on “Social Hygiene,” “Posture,”
and “General Health,” attendance has been

SpEl'_I‘S€.

 It is.-hardly necessary to stress here the im-
portance of ii_1eiitally and physically social
conscious individua.ls to the whole of society.
Today students can Show an awareness of their
responsibility to turning out this afternoon to
see~W AA 's double feature——“Science and Med-
icine," “and “The 1Gi»I°t‘of Life "’ to learn from
an intelligent and sane presentation of human

A birth. ‘ ' '

The recent uncalled for banning which met
the pictiires on “Birth of a Baby” in Life
1n'ake's thispicture even more timely if such
is possible, than the subject would ordinarily
be. ‘ Uoiigratiilations go to VVAA and the stu-
deiiii liealth doctors who have made ‘the cam-
pus‘ .‘sl'lO\l"lllg of “The Gift of Life.”

Deutschland, Deutschland

N Lll\'E with its policy of free speech for all,
- the News today, upon the advice of its ad-
V'ei'tisiiig' staﬁ, prints an advertiseiiient welcom-
l11g”'51ll students to visit Germany as the ﬁnal
‘t0l‘l“I.‘.lJ_ to their education.

We recomiiiend that all students read and
seriouslfy consider the proposal. Germany is
the f:it.liei-laiid of such great" artists and think-
ers as B'eethov'en, Mozart, Goethe, \Vagne_i:,
Diiz'ei*', Nietschep, Kant. Of course they ’re dead
now, but their Vaterland exists yet.

Tliey‘ were great minds, these names who
make ad copy for modern Germany. Unfor-
tuiiately they lived in the days when Germaiiy
liiid not yet recognized its greatness.

T:'vi-y lived in the days when there was no
means of forcing opinion upon proper channels.
l:un-_;.«.nuel Kant, for example, had not_ the bene-
ﬁt of .-i patterned cosinography. But, all in all,
he d.i~:l rather well, considering the fact that he
l'l:'l<i_ to think for himself.

in those days Goethe had no recipe for his
1,7»-eIr_ry, nor \Vagiier for his opera. Germany
iiizly point to them today as examples of Ger-
ni-i;-: ll;1l'e.llll00(l. \\’hile they did not under-
stzimi wliiit Gerniaiiy might become, they la-
lMl‘(?.kl ?,lll(lt‘l' the weight of inspiration, were
iaeirer blessed by _prescription.

bile they may tour to Princeton to see the
greatest contemporary mind of Germany,
Albert Einstein, lecturing before his classes.
Or they may go to New York Harbor and
wait for the arrival of Sigmund Freud from
Austria, and it is not unlikely that he may
bring with him an interpretation of the mod-

News’ Peace Poll

Disarmament, Revised League
Hold Students’ Hope Of Peace

World disarmament and the coercive powers of a
league of nations are, in the opinion of undergradu-
ates of the University, the world’s hope for peace in
days to come, it was disclosed late yesterday when
ballots in the sixth Pitt News student poll of the
year were tallied.

A similar poll has been ‘conducted recently in
many colleges and universities throughout the‘ na-
tion. The University poll has been carried on'in

today at 11:30 o’clock in Memorial hall.

Students voted vigorously on the question:
“Would you urge American entrance into a hypo-
thetical revised league of nations, with strengthened
provisions for peaceful change and revision of
treaties?” Aﬁirmation to the count of approxi-
mately 65% to 35% was registered.

Favor Disarmaments

Even more emphatic was the ballot on the propo-
sition as to whether the United States should in the
future work toward a policy of progressive dis-
armament in cooperation with other powers, with
clearly 70% of those undergraduates questioned
voting “Yes.”

Furthermore, the whole of America’s armed forces
should be withdrawn from China, according to 61%
of»-the ballots cast. In addition, 52% of the voters
disapproved on various grounds the recent attempt
of liberals and paciﬁsts to establish a consumers’
boycott against Japanese goods sold in America.

To date, as sentiment has been revealed, a 68%
majority of students will neither support, nor par-
ticipate in, any war conducted by their government
on foreign shores.
the Oxford pledge not to support the United States
in any War whatsoever, at home or abroad, ‘while
18% record their willingness to “follow the ﬂag”
wherever their government feels it represents a
legitimate trade and treaty right.

Optional ROTC .

The notorious “billion dollar navy bill” now un-
der ﬁre in the deliberative chambers of the United
States senate, was sanctioned by a clear majority of
55 . .. .

University students, on the basis ‘of these returns,
may be said to desire a huge navy which will stay
at home and mind its own business.

In harmony with what is deemed to be a demo-
cratic right, colleges where ROTC training is com-
pulsory should be made to alter their policy and
make such activity optional, in the minds of 75%
of the student electorate.

In answer to the problem of what the United
States government should do at the present time 
the matter of international relations, opinion was
hopelessly divided and apparently inconsistent.

A majority apparently favored collective sanc-
tions of an economic sort, and at the same time
more strongly supported a policy of neutrality.

Simultaneously, the idea of a complete embargo
on trade with nations at war found favor with
about half of those voting. Assertations were made,
however, to the effect that questions in this section
of the ballot were not phrased to accommodate the
possible qualiﬁcations founded on variables in the
situation.

what my intentions are.

I should like to return to the
University of Pittsburgh some-
time in the future to resume my
present position, if certain
changes in the physical set-up
surrounding that position are
made. The changes I refer to
are in the nature of additional
facilities with which to work.
In a. general way I list these fa-
cilities as follows: ‘

1. A rehearsal room, in which
it would be possible to keep
such properties as are necessary

 unobstructed ﬂoor » space,
at least 20 by 40 feet in size.

2. The possibility of rehearsing
in the stage as often as any par-
ticular play requires, instead of
being restricted by budget‘ to. a
speciﬁc number of stage rehear-
sals for ‘every "play with no re-
gard to the speciﬁc needs of
each.

bemade available to the class in
play production for the purpose
of producing laboratory one-act
plays.

In view of the fact that I have
already accepted
ment at the University of ‘Wis-
consin, and since my wish to re-
turn to the University of Pitts-
burgh is conditional, I realize
that my request fora leave of
absence may be refused, andin
such a case I have no cause for
resentment. I hope, however,

, that Vmyhonesty and frankness
in the matter may be appre-
 V '

In the event that my request
for a..le,ave of absence is refused,"
I can only tender my resigna-
tion. Therefora. please accept

nation,

Penn Relay Squad

Ohl, McKee, Ferrara, Bazyl: Included
In Olson’s Selected Cinder Team

That Competes In Philadelphia

By BILL MAZEFSKY
A-sophomore-packed squad of Panther track stars will race
for national honors this Friday and Saturday, at Philadelphia ’s

lspacious Franklin Field, when the annual Penn Relays again
draw the country's topnotch collegiatevtracksters.

Four sec-

ond year men, Frank Ohl, Al McKee, Frank Ferrara, and Johnny

Bazyk, will be included in the¢

Quakertown-bound Pitt contin-
gent. .

Olson ﬁrst suspected that he had
a prize crop of sophomores at the
outset of the Indoor season when
his mile relay team started to beat
the outstanding quartets. When

. , .his—,_rc_>_okie bator; wielders had run

every other ‘relay ‘team “off the
boards Olson was sure that in
sophomore Ohl, McKee, and Fer-
:rara together with junior Johnny
Woodruff he had a crack quartet.
FAST TIME SEEN

These four Panther runners
will go into the Penn Relay teams,
favored to -win the Class A mile
relay title. This is the ﬁrst time
in Pitt track history that the relay
team has been asked to race in
‘Class A. A win in this event will
place the relay team at the head
of the class in national outdoor
competition; they already hold
the indoor premiership.

Unless some of the California
schools enter the main threat will
come from the NYU mile relay
team, which is anchored by Jim
Herbert, newest half-mile and
quarter mile sensation. The Pitt
relay team should be able to -stand
off the NYU four, and don’t be
ﬁabbergasted if they step around
in the very, ‘very fast time of 3
minutes, 17 seconds.

The other relay team-——the med-
ley relay,i;s_t__s-—-has to defend last
year’s title, which they won in
World, record time. Captain Ed.-
gar Mason, and Frank Oh] will
sprint the. 220; Al McKee will do
the quarter mile; and. Johnny
Woodruff. will anchor the team at
his specialty, the half-mile.

BAZYK LAUDED

The F.reshma,n team also has a
title defense on its hand. Last
year the present crop of sopho-
mores won the mile relay title,
and this year the freshmen team
will try to duplicate. Del Ander-
son, Bob Graf, Larry Tregonning,
and Al Boulanger will try to make
it two in a row.

The other sophomore Johnny
Bazyk, who has been edging up
toward the top during the Indoor
season at the shot-put, will again
step out against stellar competi-
tion during the Penn relays. O1-
son thin_ks_that, Bazyk will be one
of the count.r_y’s best weightmen
before the season. has run out.

Golfers Nearly
Ready, Melvin

Breaks Record

~ z ‘.With, one.» ma_t_ch,,alrea_dy under
their belt, Pitt’s golfers are look-
ing forward with only slight mis-
givings to the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Golf Conference opening.

What with Souchak shooting
sub-par golf, Tony Kaye, his usual
consistent self, Melvin breaking
records, and Daddio, Lawry and
Simpson smoothing out, Pitt’s
sextet is almost ready for Penn-
sylvania, Georgetown, Princeton,
et al.

The Panthers meet Penn State
next Saturday afternoon, at State
in a non-conference" match before
the real shooting gets under way.
The following week will see the
beginning of Conference competi-
tion.’

Friday, May 6, the Panthers
take on Penn State to open con-
ference play and the following
day meet Cornell. Both matches
will be played at Alcoma, Pitt’s
home course.

Barrett Melvin, Pit_t_ No. 3. man,
got hot; last Sunday. at Alcoma to
break the course record. Melvin
recorded a, 64, one. shot under. the
course record. The previous rec-
ord washeld. jointly by Art Sny-
der, Pitt coach and Alcoma pro-
fessional, and‘ by his assistant,
Tony Barkovitch. ’

Melvin made an eagle and six

‘birdies to shave eight strokes off

par. Jimmy Hagan, University
Athletic Director, was Melvin’s
partner on the record-breaking
round.

Practicing Baseballers Keep Stadium Filled I

Tuieitty-Nine Team; Submit Entry Eldnks

By BILL lVIcELWAIN

With opening day less than a
week away, intra-mural baseball
seems headed for the greatest
success any intra-mural enter-
prise has enjoyed at the Univer-
sity in recent years.

Announcement of the tourna-
ment was made April 18 by James

Hagan, director of athletics, but in ~

the short time intervening, twen-
ty-nine teams have been organ-
ized and entered. The teams have
been going through practice ses-
sions all week on the Stadium and
will continue to do so for the rest

ofthe week. Any‘ teams which_

have not yet, practiced may ar-
range a practice period by apply-
ing to Frank Carver’s ofﬁce, on
the 27th floor, Cathedral. _
FIRST GAME MAY 2

Frank Mecca and his crew have
peeled turf from the gridiron in
the Stadium and have produced a
playing ﬁeld comparable to most
big league parks. Left ﬁeld, ex-
tending well over 400 feet, is
much longer thany any left ﬁeld
in the majors. Right ﬁeld is the
shortest portion of the outer gar-
den, but is only thirty feet shorter
than the right ﬁeld wall of the
Polo Grounds. I

Though the ﬁrst game will be
played Monday, May 2, the ofﬁ-

cial gala openmg will be eitheri

May 6 or 7 during Spring Festival.
The official opening will be. an
elaborate affair with the throwing
out of the ﬁrst ball and the ﬂag-
raising. So far, it has not been
decided who will be given the
honor of making the season’s ﬁrst
wild pitch. The season will con-
tinue through May 25 on a ﬁve-
day week with two games each
day.
LOCKERS AVAILABLE

Seniors in the tourney. will be
playing for the fun of it, but there
will be an added incentive for any
lower- clalssmen. Actually, the
whole intra-mural program is a
sort of super-tryout for the ﬁrst
Pitt varsity baseball team in 14

MANY ENTRANTS

The University will supply most.

Convention ‘Most l

O
Conservative’
By RUGY ALDISERT

“Most conservative” meet-
ing of the ﬁve annual Intercol-
legiate Conferences on Govern-
.mcnt is the University delega-
tion’s description of the organ-
ization’s model conference of
governors held last weekend in
Harrisburot " i I

Returniiig to campus Sunday _

evening after three days of har-
anguing at the state capitol build-
ings in both committee and plen-
ary sessions, veteran student so-
lons from the University also re-
port that this year’s intercollegiate
delegation as a whole was the best
prepared group, ever to particilpate
in the series of government con-
claves. . ‘
‘LIBERAL LEADERS’

Outstanding in the 35 schools
represented was the Texas dele-
gation from Temple. Financed by
the Philadelphia university, their
26 sombrero-draped political sci-
ence students dominated practical-
ly every committee of administra-
tive oﬂicers. With the aid of mim-
eographed recommendations pre-
paredin a special course at Tem-
ple for the ICG, they -tookrlhonors
with Indiana State Teachers’ col-
lege in knowledge ‘of problems
considered. '

The University delegation, rep-
resenting the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, though‘ split on al-
most every proposal, was classed
as the “leader of the liberals.” Bill
Stark‘, C38, chairman of the Uni-
niversity delegation, was unanim-
ously elected vice-chairman of the
entire conference and also served
as parliamentarian of the associa-
tion of governors.

MOTION V DEFEATED

Commenting on the diﬂ:'erences
of opinions within the University
delegation, ‘Stark points out that
it showed", that each student? was
thinking outwevery problem for
himself, not ’‘‘voting blindly.”

Saul Dizenfeld, C39, lieutenant
governor, was sponsor of the hotly
contested proposal against the in-
corporation of labor unions. De-
ﬁant in a heated debate on his
amendment to the labor commit-
tee report,'Dizenfeld stormed the
ﬂoor ofgtheassembly with ques-
tion after-question’ to the conserv-
ative opposition. His motion, how-
ever, was defeated.

Y  Last
