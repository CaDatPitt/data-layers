Dedication ceremonies for
Oakland's new Family House
were held yesterday, as Mrs.
Ginny Thornburg and other civic
leaders attended to praise the
revolutionary project.

Family House, the first one of
it’s kind in the country, is a spe-
cial home for adult patients and
their families who live outside
the Pittsburgh area and are here
for organ transplant, cancer
treatment and other life threat-
ening illnesses.

Family House works on the
same basic principle as the
Ronald McDonald House, but is
not for children.

Donations from l58 different
firms and individuals payed for
the price tag on the Family
House. One portion ofthe house
is a renovated house that is now

adjoined to a new unit built by
the Mellon-Stuart Company for
only the cost of the materials.
One of the highlights of the dedi-
cation ceremony was the Pitts-
burgh Pirate organization’s
contributiontof $50,000 to the
house.

Other major contributors were
The American Cancer Society
and it’s women’s auxiliary,
Frank B. Fuher, and the R.K.
Mellon Foundation.

One of the most interesting

‘speakers at yesterday’s dedica-

tion was project’s first contribu-
tor. A women from Chicago
accumulated a two-thousand
dollar hotel bill while her hus-
band was hospitalized for a heart
transplant. Her neighbors raised
two thousand dollars for her, but
instead of paying her bill, she
made her $2000 the first contri-
bution to the fund.

Student Organizations
Decide Against Lecture

By TODD ERKEL

Presidential candidate Sen. Gary
Hart, D-Colorado, will not be
speaking at Pitt as his local cam-
paign organization had hoped. Two
Pitt organizations — the Student
Government Board and the Pitt
Program Council — could not come
to an agreement on whether to bring
the democratic hopeful here, so
instead, he will lecture at Duquesne
University.

According to Shirley Novak, a
Hart campaign worker and coordi-
nator of the candidate’s visit, Stu-
dent Government Board president
Mark Downs expressed interest in
bringing Hart to Pitt but later said
that he could not get the Pitt Pro-
gram Council to provide a room for
the lecture, although space was
available.

“I contacted Mark Downs, and he
seemed very excited about bringing
Hart to Pitt,” Novak said. “Then he
called back and said that the Pitt
Program Council did not want to
provide one candidate with a room
to lecture because it was afraid of an
equal—time problem.”

Al Frione, chairman of PPC’s
Lecture Committee said the issue of

obtaining a room was never dis-

cussed with Downs. He told Downs
that he didn’t have the time to organ-
ize a lecture in between last week’s
visit by Arkady Shevchenko and
next week’s appearance by Alex
Haley.

“I did not have the time to con-
duct three lectures in three weeks,”
Frione said. Frione went on to say
that he expressed concern to Downs
about the issue of an equal-time pol-

icy, either written or understood
within the university.

He also said that SGB could have
organized the lecture without the
help of the programming council.

“I had no say in the matter if they
wanted to do that,” Frione said.

Downs defended the decision not
to bring Hart to Pitt, saying that
insufficient time prevented the
board from thoroughly reviewing
the visit and how it might conflict
with the board’s bylaws, which pro-
hibit the funding and endorsement
of any political candidate.

“It may have been possible, but
there just wasn't enough time,”
Downs said. “We [the board] would
have had to sit down and discuss the
implications.”

Other student government board
members contacted said they did not
know enough about the matter to
comment.

University policy on political
campaigns says that while no stu-
dent activities money can be used to
fund honoraria, candidates may be
invited to speak and be provided
with university facilities. The reser-
vations office of the university, and
not the Pitt Program Council, is in
charge of providing those facilities.
Hart‘s visit would not have involved
an honorarium, according to
Novak.

According to Pat McCullough of
Pitt’s Office of University Counsel,
the university has no legal obligation
to provide equal time to candidates
such as is required of the broadcast
media under the provisions of the
Fairness Doctrine.

Computers To Aid
Basic Writing Problems

By MICHAEL A. KOSOL

A research group at Pitt has
received a half a million dollars
from the Ford Foundation to
develop a computer-based sys-
tem that will help basic writing
students work on their writing
problems.

run-on sentences. but the prob-

Pitt's main purpose is to “look at

USA TODAY: Spoonful Of Sugar?

A panel of editors from The

burgh Press and Post-Gazette
will discuss the impact of USA

Tuesday at 8 p.m. The panel will
be titled “USA Today: Journal-
ism or Junkfood?"

The discussion. which coin-
cides with USA Today’s first
anniversary earlier this month,
will begin with opening remarks
by Nancy Woodhull, the news-
paper’s managing editor. Panel-
ists include Ron Patel, assistant
managing editor of The Philadel-
phia Inquirer; John Craig, editor
of the Post-Gazette; and Angus
McEachran, editor of the Press.

The junkfood part of the dis-
cussion becomes relevant in dis-
cussing the actual value of USA
Today, despite the paper's
appealing packaging, according
to assistant professor Jim Ross.

“The fundamental question
about USA Today is whether it’s
serious reporting on news and
issues or whether it‘s just a pretty
package that’s well-marketed,
well-designed but has no nutri-
tional value,“ Ross, one of the
co-ordinators of the panel, said.

Ross said it is a timely issue
because many people consider
USA Today a revolution in
journalism.

“in terms of marketing, most
journalists thought this didn‘t

have a prayer,” he said.

Although the newspaper is
projected to be about $70 million
in the red this year, it has a circu-
lation of l.l million.

Most journalists originally
thought the market for a paper
such as USA Today was small, if
not non-existent. The only
American newspaper with all
national news, it is geared
toward the person who travels
and reads other newspapers as a
supplement.

Ross said USA Today has had
an effect on newspapers around
the country, including those in
Pittsburgh, as far as use ofcolor,

graphics, story tightness and
pictures.
“They’ve had a profound

influence in terms of graphics
and design," he said. “You can
even see this is the Pittsburgh
Press and Post-Gazette.
Although many newspapers
might not admit it, a lot of
changes that have occurred have
occurred because of USA
Today.”

The group has received eight
Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC) micro-computers to be
used in the project. They will be
tied into a computer at the
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center (LRDC), rather
than into the main-line system in
Blanox.

The research group consists of
David Bartholamae, director of
Pitt’s composition program; Jim
Fox, a software engineer;
Glynda Hull, a postdoctoral fel-
low; Alan Lesco, a research asso-
ciate of psychology; and Bill
Smith, director of Pitt’s writing
workshop.

About 44 students will be
selected to use computers this
coming term.

“The reason we want to have
something up in December is to
give us a chance to try things and
to provide us with input to help
the system evolve," Smith said.

“Basic writers. who make up
40 percent of the freshmen writ-
ing class, are not bad writers, but
they do tend to make certain
kinds of errors.” Smith said.

For example, some students

enable students to use a sophisti-
cated word-processor to edit
their text, and to utilize a pro-
gram that will search for spelling
errors.

“it is important that people
realize that this system will not
correct the student’s spelling,"
Bartholomae said. “It will be
used to point out that an error
exists, and the student has to find
it.”

In time, additional programs
may be added to the system to
check for punctuation and die-
tion errors.

For example, when “it’s is fol-
lowed by a noun, the computer
might ask: ‘Did you mean to say
‘it is’ or ‘its'?" Bartholomae said
this a common error made by
many inexperienced writers that
some day may be detected by the
computer. -

While the computer is working
with the student to correct the
mechanics ofthe test, the instruc-
tor can help the student with
style and mental reasoning.

“We want the computers to do
what they do best and teachers to
do what they do best," Hull saidi

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

The practice of law has histori-
cally been viewed as a profession
that seems to dazzle people with
rhetorical speeches and legal jar-
gon, as the hometown lawyer per-
suades the judge and jury of his
client’s innocence.

There is, however, much more
behind the legal profession than oral
argument in open court. Lawyers
spend hours upon hours of research
to develop a case that will virtually
never see the inside of a courtroom.
The trial lawyer does exist today,
but he probably represents one of
the smallest percentages of lawyers
in the legal spectrum.

It has often been said that there
are too many lawyers today and that
the chances of securing a job upon
graduation from law school are very
slim. However, every year, thou-
sands upon thousands of applica-
tions arrive at the admissions offices
of law schools across the country,
with students from practically every
age group competing to enter the
school of their choice.

Until well past 1850, the chief
method of legal education in Amer-

ica was through apprenticeship. In
fact, many lawyers did not even
have the benefit of such journeyman
training, but like Abraham Lincoln,
prepared themselves for the bar
through self-directed reading.
Nevertheless, in the United States
today, there are 172 American Bar
Association (ABA) approved
schools. The tri-state area (W.Va.,
Ohio, Pa.) includes fourteen of
them, with six located in Pa. Some
of these area schools include: Pitt,
Villanova, Dickinson, Temple,
Duquesne, West Virginia, Dayton,
North Western and Penn. Each
school has its own entrance require-
ments, which can vary widely in
degree of difficulty.

The law school application pro-
cess, just like any other graduate
application procedure, is one of
time, effort and precision. The first
step in the process is to register for
the Law School Admissions Test
(LSAT) and the Law School Data
Assembly Service (LSDAS). Let us
first consider the latter.

The LSDAS is a service which
works on behalf of the Law School
Admissions Council, a non-profit
organization consisting of one
representative from each law school
accredited by the ABA or a member
of the Association of American Law
Schools. Its purpose is to provide
fast and efficient service and coordi-
nation for the law school admissions

process. LSDAS brings together in
one report the information required
of an applicant to most law schools
today. The service receives under-
graduate and graduate school trans-
cripts and converts them into a
standardized summary.

All of the applicant’s transcripts,

‘standardized summggyl Lﬁal,
Lawyer

results, and biographical data is sent
to each law school to which he has
applied. In other words, this service
does everything that the law schools
had to do in the past in regard to
evaluating and categorizing a stu-
dent on a standard scale. This ser-
vice is a must for most ABA
accredited law schools because it
eases their admission. process by
100 percent. The applicant and one
law school to which he has applied
receive a copy of the LSDAS report
once all the required information
has been supplied.

The LSAT is also required of all
ABA accredited law schools. It is a
standardized test designed to assist
law schools in assessing the aca-
demic promise of their applicants.
The questions are drawn from a
broad range of disciplines and give
no advantage to examinees from a
particular academic background.

The Pitt News, Wcdncsdavfseptember 28. I983?

I he test consists of six sections and
a writing sample. Four sections are
graded while the other two are
experimental sections. The exami-
nee is not aware of which two are
experimental and is advised to
approach each section as if it were
to be graded. The scoring is on a
scale of 10-50: Fair 28-32, Good 34-
40 and Excellent 42 and above. The
writing sample is not graded but
photocopied and sent to the law
schools to be weighed by their own
standards.

Although the test consists of six
sections, there are only four types of
question sections used. They
include: Facts and Issues, Reading
Comprehension, Logical Games
and Logical Reasoning.

It is often argued that this type of
standardized testing does not ade-
quately portray a student’s potential
to succeed in that particular curricu-
lum, and this may very well be true.
However, John E. Murray, dean and
professor at Pitt’s law school, said
that the newly revised LSAT is a
better indicator of how one will per-
form in law school than some of the
other graduate testing systems are
for their programs. “We have
found,” said Murray, “that particu-
larly at the high and low levels, this
type of testing is an accurate predic-
tion of success; you always have
your exceptions, but over the long
run, it can be considered a fair

forecaster.”

Once the LSAT and LSDAS are
taken care of, one must go through
the process of figuring out to which
schools to apply. Questions to con-
sider while doing this are: What are
the minimum requirements for
acceptance to each law school?,
How does my LSAT and GPA mea-
sure up to their standards?, Where
do I really want to go?, and Where
do I have a good chance to get in?

The admissions process at every
law school is always one of competi-
tion. Where a law school will receive
any where from 1.200 to 2,500 appli-
cations, it may have only up to 200
openings. So to increase your chan-
ces of accceptance, apply to at least
six, if not eight, law schools within
your general range of acceptance. If
you apply to only two or three and
some unfortunate circumstances
prevent you from being accepted,
you end up out in the cold. Again,
the competition is tough, and the
openings are few. By applying to
more schools, you increase your
chances of getting in somewhere.

Factors considered in the admis-
sion decision vary from school to
school, and since there are always
exceptions, sometimes even from
applicant to applicant. However,
standard factors in order of impor-
tance usually include: LSAT, GPA,‘
trend in grades, difficulty of curricu-
lum, class rank, capacity for leader-
ship and extracurricular activities.
Recently, many schools have been
giving more attention to the GPA
rather than the LSAT, although the
law boards must still be within a
given range.

For example, last year, Pitt’s law
school statistics were: applicants -
1,231; openings —— 230; GPA — 3.3
(avg.) and LSAT — 35. The Univer-
sity of Dayton’s statistics were:
applicants — 790; openings —— 180;
GPA — 3.04 (med.) and LSAT -
30; while W.V.U’.s statistics were:
applicants —— 610; openings — 140;
GPA — 3.27 (avg.) and LSAT —— 32.

These statistics represent the
average or median scores of the
applicants accepted by each of the
schools mentioned above. Others
were accepted with higher scores
and some with lower scores. It is
best, however, to use the published

_ scores as a guide to which schools

One way in which law schools are
ranked today is through what is
known as the Resource Index Sys-
tem. The index is strictly quantita-
tive in nature and should by no
means be used as a measure of qual-
ity. Its usefulness lies in the fact that
it helps compare the objective fac-
tors normally considered important
by members of the ABA accrediting
teams. These factors include:
number of students, student/faculty
ratio, number of faculty, library
volumes/faculty ratio and number
of volumes in library.

Joseph Adams, a third-year Pitt
law student, said, “The hardest part
about law school is adjusting to the
different method of instruction and
testing. You are required, everyday,
to be prepared for that day's assign-
ment, and you never know when
you are going to be called on.”
Adams said that it is nothing like
undergraduate work where many
times you can let things slide until
several days before the exam.
“Your entire grade,” Adams said,
“many times rides on that one
exam, and a whole term’s work of
hundreds of cases cannot be read,
let alone understood, in a couple of
days.”

Each law school usually has a
placement service for students who
have little or no connections on the
outside, and they tend to be fairly
responsive to the student’s needs.
Even though there appears to be an
overload of lawyers in our communi-
ties today, many of them are receiv-
ing jobs within eighteen months
after graduation.

The aspect of being a doctor of

Pitt medical school alone receives
about 3,000 applications a year for
136 positions. Nationally, one out of
every 2.1 applicants gets into a med-
ical school.

According to Dr. Barbara Levey,
director of admissions at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh School of Medi-
cine, there is a lot to getting
accepted into medical school, but
“the bottom line is academic
competence.”

This is judged by grades and
scores on the Medical College
Admissions Tests (MCATs), a ser-
ies of six achievement tests given in
one day. The MCATs have been
shown to be a predictor of a stu-
dent’s success during the first two
years of med school.

The MCATs test knowledge and
ability in biology, chemistry, phys-
ics, problem-solving and quantita-
tive reasoning. They’re graded on a
scale of 1 to 15, with 15 being a
perfect score.

One Pitt junior will be taking her
MCATs on Saturday, and she
began studying for them last
summer. She took eight prepara-
tory courses over the summer and
went on her own to listen to practice
exams on tape for three or four
hours every day. Now, because of
school, she is only able to study for
the MCATs on weekends.

“I won’t go out on week-days,”
she said. “I study. I only go out one
night on weekends, depending on
how much work I’ve done.”

Applications to the school are
reviewed at Pitt by a committee of
19, and some applicants are called
back for interviews with the
committee.

“It’s just assumed you’ll have
good grades and good MCAT
scores,” the student said. “Your
interview will determine it. Just
because you have good grades and
good MCATs, it doesn’t mean
you're in.”

Levey agreed that there are many
other factors inﬂuencing whether or
not a student is accepted into medi-
cal school. These include outside
activities, letters of recommenda-
tion and work experience within and
outside of the medical world.

“Even if it’s something totally
unrelated,” Levey said, “if someone
has to work to get his or her educa-
tion, admission committees look at
how much time he spends at work.
We look_ for a diverse class.”

Contrary to belief by those who
are not in the medical field, there is
no such thing as a “pre-med” major.

determining whether a student is
accepted into medical school.

The quota, system is an illegal
practice, Levey said, and no medical
school can legally accept a minority
student because he is a minority.

Getting into medical school is just
the first step. Tuition to Pitt’s med
school is $11,600 for in-state, first-
year students —— out-of-staters pay
$16,400 for their first year. This does
not include living expenses or
expensive textbooks.

“A person should consider very
seriously whether he wants medi-
cine,” Levey said. “That motivation
is not only very important getting
into medical school but getting
through medical school.”

She said the first two years of med
school are spent doing bookwork
and doing the basics; the last years
are spent in clerkships. In addition
to classwork, students must take
three parts of the national board
exams.

If a student passes all three parts
of the boards, he is considered able
to practice in almost any state.

The education does not end with
medical school. Following those
four years, a physician must train in
a residency program, formerly
called an internship. A physician
cannot be licensed in Pennsylvania
until he completes at least one year
training in a program that has been
approved by
Council on Graduate Medical
Education.

The required number of years in a
residency differ by specialty. Plastic
surgeons, for example, must have
seven years of general and plastic
surgery training in addition to four
years of medical school, according
to Mary Lee, director of the Gradu-
ate Medical Education Office.

In addition to this on-the-job"

experience, residents must still go
to lectures and accompany doctors
on their rounds.

“If they do not keep up with read-
ing and their paperwork, they could
be in danger of being dismissed from
the training program,” Lee said.

“When they leave medical school,.

they have had some exposure to
patients by virtue of their clerkships
in hospitals, but they are given most
of their education in their specialty
during the residency itself.”

Applications are screened, and
those applicants who meet the

The learning doesn’t stop once
one officially becomes a doctor.
There are always innovations in the
medical field; doctors must keep up

Leon said in his address that
contributions came from numer-

and foundations who lent their
suppport by giving funds, servi-
ces, materials and time to estab-
lish Family House.

The house is equipped with 39
bedrooms. Many of these have
double beds and some other sin-
gles. An important factor ofthe
house is that it does not provide
care for patients, nor for the
guests. It is simply a place for
out-of-town people to stay at a
low cost while their loved ones

Tour guides described an ideal
use of the home as a wife staying
at the Family House while her
husband undergoes surgery.
They can then both stay there
until the husband is on his feet.

The need for this type ofhouse
has grown as the number of
transplants at university hospi-
tals has grown. The projections
for heart and liver transplants
has already exceeded this years
projections. The need for such a
house here in Oakland is due to
the great amount ofspecial oper-
ations and world-renowned sur-
geons in Pittsburgh.

The womens’ auxiliary of the
Cancer Society will maintain a
staff to run the house. They will
also be assisted by a full-time
house manager who will deal

Library Offers Job Service

By CATHERINE KIRSCH

More than simply a repository
for literary and artistic materials,
Carnegie Library offers a res-
ervoir of educational and career
information through its Job
Information Center (JIC).

Operating through four
branch locations (Oakland,
Allegheny Regional, East Lib-
erty and Knoxville), the center
provides public assistance in
researching and assessing thejob
market. Relevant data is accessi-
ble through books, pamphlets,
directories, government publica-
tions and periodicals.

Among the center’s primary
reference sources is a computer-
ized retrieval service called the
Guidance Information System
(GIS). According to Edna Hahn
of the central library’s staff, the
system provides a wealth of
information regarding occupa-
tions; college graduate schools,
and vocational and technical
schools.

The center functions as a sup-
plementary service augmenting
searches for opportunities in a
selected field of interest. How-

Psychiatrist Finds Divinity In Sex

By ED TACK ,

Psychiatrist and author M.
Scott Peck didn't always believe
that God thought of passion,
sexual sensation and the rever-
ence that a sensual relationship
can bring.

In fact, Peck didn't think too
highly of the Almighty, thank
you.

“When I was a student,
nothing seemed more unlikely
than the idea that we could break
God down into anthropomor-
phic elements,“ Peck, who
authored The Road Less Tra-
velled, a I978 national best seller,
told the audience of 600-plus at
Carnegie Hall this past Friday
night.

Peck not only now can break
his image of God into male and
female parts, but he said that
human sexual relationships can
be a powerful taste of the divine
and that people are foolish to dis-
dain the addition of spirituality
into their sexual lives.

Citing examples from litera-
ture and the Old Testament,
Peck painted oral images of lov-
ers glorified in their mutual bliss.

“He wounded my neck when
he took away his hand . . . and as
I lay my own hand on my
beloved, I forgot myself. . . I left
my cares on the lily pads."

Corny? Peck didn't think so.
He emphatically maintained that
by bringing care, reverence,
thoughtfulness and patience that
both physical loving and spirit-
ual growth demand, one can
transcend the usual sexual state
and reach higher levels of
enjoyment.

“The subjective experience of
orgasm seems to be that when
you are withisomeone deeply
beloved to you, we can reach
these points whereby we lose
conscience of the partner
himself.

“As the Old Testament says,
‘We have left the earth... We are
now parts of God's country.‘ "

Sex, itself, Peck said, is a
search for God. “Humans, I have
come to know, in the midst ofall
their troubles, seem to be forever
searching for a moment in the
totality of God-like bliss and
union. We are always yearning
for wholeness, searching for the
Godhead.

“Atheists, agnostics, anyone
who doesn't think of the exist-
ence of a divinity recognizes that
orgasm with the one they love is a
very God-like experience," he
said.

Peck quickly said. however.
that sexuality and spirituality are
not the same “though they arise
from the same cloth."Something
else is needed, he said.

Dedication to the Divine, he
said, is paramount in fusing these
two. Subsequently, the Divine,
he said, is dedicated to us.

“God isa seducer. a wooer,“ he
said. “He could have made sex as
secular as breathing itself, but he
didn't. He chose to force us to
bring more reverence to it.

“Once he's trapped us, as a
lover might, he would consume
our spirit, like a lover. We’ll find

that he’s been wanting for our
spirit."

Yet, for many people, Peck
said, the only way to merge pas-
sion for God and love for a
human being may be through the
practice of celibacy.

Celibacy, he said, is sexual
passion directed at the Creator.
“It is a true affirmation of the
first commandment: No strange
Gods before me, says the Crea-
mRecommr,ndations: “Celibacy
is good for some people for some
times. I think it’s best when the

celibate make their choice
because they realm: that I cannot
give everything to God and
everything to another human
being."

“Sex is a problem for every-
body,” he said. “Men, women,
priests, nuns, children, teachers,
young teenagers, young adults,
midlife people, doctors, lawyers,
ministers, business people,
psychiatrists—everybody.

Nobody ever gets away from
the problem of sex; no one ever
gets over the obstacles, but we
can be more aware of what it can
be."

Peck warned against oversel-
ling the spirituality-sexuality
philosophy. “I’m afraid, for
example, that some people over
90 out there will feel that they
have to knock themselves out
over it." 

A woman objected to Peck‘s

..masculine perception of God. “I
need to know that if I am created
in the image and likeness ofGod,
that he or she has feminine quali-
ties," The audience applauded.
Peck termed his language
“culture-bound," with no yet-
developed answer.

Opinion

H(e)artIess

Sen. Gary Hart, a leading candidate in the 1984
presidential candidate, will be in town tomorrow to
speak to local college students. Those students, how-
ever, will not be Pitt students.

Pitt was given the opportunity to host Hart, but
because of members of the Student Government
Board and the Pitt Program Council, he will be speak-
ing at Duquesne University instead.

A local campaign worker for Hart approached SGB
president Mark Downs about the possibility of sche-
duling Hart here and Downs, at first, was enthusiastic
and supportive of the idea. Later, however, he called
the campaign worker back and said there was a prob-
lem with an “equal-time policy” and room
reservations.

PPC also declined bringing Hart because, as lecture
committee chairman Al Frione said, there wasn’t
enough time to schedule three lectures in three weeks.

Both SGB and PPC have missed an excellent oppor-
tunity to prove that they have the best interests of the
students in mind.

Many students at this university will be voting in
their first presidential election next year and should be
informed about the candidates who are running. By
not scheduling Hart, these two groups are helping
contribute to the ignorance and apathy that is too
often associated with the college-age voter.

In a university that supports knowledge of Ameri-
ca’s political system and politicians in general, Hart
would have been a great educational experience for
Pitt students. '

Downs said that the SGB had insufficient time to
review the visit and was unsure how it fit into the
board’s bylaws. SGB has not done anything note-
worthy this whole term, other than holding a Suitcase
Party for the opening ofthe William Pitt Union. While
this is line, only two Pitt students won.

If Hart had been brought to Pitt, the whole student
population would have won by seeing the democratic
process in action.

There was also a question of “equal—time.” Both
SGB and PPC were afraid if they allowed Hart to
speak at Pitt, they would be ﬂooded with complaints
by other candidates who demanded equal time. Uni-
versity Counsel has said Pitt has no obligation to
provide equal time as is stated in the Fairness
Doctrine.

Let’s face facts, Pitt is not a Harvard or a Yale, so it’s
doubtful that hundreds of presidential candidates
would be ﬂocking to Pitt demanding equal time. Even
if they did, Pitt should provide a forum for them,
whether they be members of the Democratic, Republi-
can, Consumer or Socialist parties.

Finally, this whole incident raises some important
questions in relation to PPC and the people it brings to
Pitt. Perhaps it's time PPC involves the student popu-
lation as a whole when it decides who the speakers will
be. While it may be true that Arkady Shevchenko
sold-out at Pitt, many students might have wanted to
see Hart instead of next week’s scheduled lecture feat-
uring Alex Haley.

As for Sen. Hart's supporters, or people just inter-
ested in American politics, they will have to go down-
town to Duquesne if they want to hear him.

Letters To The Editor

Guilty of Umpteenth Beatitude

Dear Editor:
The Sept. 16 letter to the editor by

Have there been such outcries,

such investigations, such disclosures

Mark R. Lawsonis another example from the Soviet Union in regard to

of the umpteenth beatitude:
“Blessed are the poor of memory, for
they shall not suffer the constraints
of knowledge." Mr. Lawson reiter-
ates the party line regarding Israeli
brutality and American indifference
to Israel’s “crimes against
humanity.”

As an example of this, he cites the
shooting down of a Libyan airliner
by Israeli fighter pilots in February,
I973. What he does not cite are the
expressions of concern and outrage
at that time from many nations in
the world, not just the Arab nations
and those in the Soviet bloc, nor

does he cite Israel’s willingness to,

have the International Red Cross
and other international bodies
examine the wreckage or speak to
the survivors.

Neither does he share the infor-
mation that within four days of the
tragedy, there were many expres-
sions of concern in the Israeli press
and a disclosure of the tapes found
in the “black box” of the wreckage
showing confusion on the part of the
French pilot who was captain of the
Libyan plane when it was shot down
as well as misunderstanding on the
part of the Israeli pilots as to the
meaning of the airliner's ambivalent
actions in evading the fighters.

the Korean airliner?

Israel paid reparations to the fam-
ilies of the passengers, although such
reparations can in no way compen-
sate for loss of life of dear ones. The
Soviet Union refuses to recognize
any responsibility, moral or other
wise, to pay reparations.

Mr. Lawson gratuitously offers
additional examples of Israeli bru-
tality: The war in Lebanon and its
consequent devastation. Obviously,
all innocent loss of life is to be
deplored and to be avoided, and few
people glory in the death of non-
combatants. But Mr. Lawson con-
veniently ignores and forgets 35
years of history in which the Arab
nations surrounding Israel have
attempted to destroy it and have not
accepted its existence as a nation
among nations, and through the
Palestinian terror organizations,
have killed countless numbers of civ-
ilians: in Munich, in Lod airport, in
tourist buses, on beaches, in market
squares, in schools, in apartment
houses.

He does not mention the constant
terroristic attacks from Palestinian
refugee camps into Israeli villages, a
terrorism which not only attacked
Israelis but the Lebanese as well.

He conveniently ignores that
PLO—armed terrorists physically hid
behind women’s skirts to attack

Israeli soldiers and that PLO sol-
diers and weapons were placed in
apartment houses, hospitals and
refugee camps, supported in large
part by American money. He decries
Israelis as considering Palestinians,
Lebanese and Libyans as “non-
people,” but he does not refer to
Libya‘s support of terror through-
out the world, to its murderous
attacks on civilians in Chad and in
Sudan.

One-tenth of the Israeli popula-
tion came out in a mass rally to pro-
test the Sabra and Chatilla camp
massacres, and an Israeli commis-
sion studied the issue and censured
the authorities who carried some
culpability for that terrible tragedy.

The Lebanese commission, on the
other hand, whitewashed the entire
incident, even though the murders
were perpetrated by Lebanese
militiamen.

If Mr. Lawson is ignorant of all
these, I am sorry for him. But if he
purposely distorts and applies selec-
tive moral standards to support his
propagandistic cause, then he needs
to be exposed for providing half-
truths or untruths to the readers of
The Pitt News.

Dear Editor:

I am a student at the law
school. About two weeks ago, I
carelessly took off my gold col-
lege ring during a class and inad-
vertantl_v left it behind when the
class was over. Minutes later,
when l realized that I wasn’t
wearing it. l returned tothe class-
room only to find it gone.
.\'aively. 1 expected that it was
found by one of by fellow law
students and would be promptly
turned in to the lost and found.
Later. I was told by the person in
charge of the lost and found that
others had lost valuable rings
and watches in the building.
never to see them again. The
maintenance supervisor, a friend
of mine. assured me that none of
the custodians had seen the ring.

In a time when the American
Bar Association has taken great
pains to reform the image oflaw-
yers as “shysters" and “crooks,“
it is disqsuieting to think that,

thanks to one of my fellow
members of the legal profession.
my ring is probably a filling in
someone‘s tooth by now. While I
realize that it is difficult for most
students to pass up an opportun-
ity to make extra money. it is not
unrealistic, l believe, to expect
the common decency and integ-
rity which ourjustice system is
presumedtoinsure fromthose
of us who will someday adminis-
ter this system.

Yes, this letter isjust as much a
product of personal bitterness
and frustration over the loss of
something monetarily and senti-
mentally valuable as my pensive
reﬂection on the present and
future state of my own profes-
sion. Moreover, it leaves me
wondering whether the values
which our common law so often
proclaims are real or merely
facade.

An Insult To Pitt Community

Dear Editor:

Your editorial dated Sept. l9 urg-
ing peace activists to change their
tactics is an insult to the Pitt student
community. Your assertion that
there is a problem with the move-
ment because some of the members
tend to be more radical than others
is inconsistent with'the principles of
democratic pluralism which you
presumably uphold.

It is difficult to see how a broad-
based mass movement, in which a
wide spectrum of individuals and
groups participate, can be expected
to follow a narrowly conceived set of‘
tactics. Can we leave the individuals
and groups which make up the
movement to decide the appropriate
tactics within the broad framework
of the legal system and individual
consciousness?

Your sarcastic comments on the
effectiveness of the peace movement
are already unwarranted. Several
public opinion polls taken during
the last couple of years have high-

Reader’s Values Are

Dear Editor:

In response to your elementary
editorial in Monday, September 19,
l983's, Pitt News entitled “Change
Tactics,“ 1 first applaud Molly Rush
and Dr. Liane Norman for their
enthusiastic passion for peace
through non-violence. The trouble
with choosing jail instead ofa fine is
not in the lack of government
response to this action, but rather, it
is in the lack ofAmericans who unite
in this spirited action. Washington
will never hear the outcry of Amer-
ica if it is passive and divided.

lighted the public concern with the
massive arms build-up, primarily by
the two superpowers. The fact that
the nuclear arms issue figures promi-
nently in the agenda for the l984
presidential elections attests to the
vigor and vitality of the campaigns

mounted by the activists.
Much more remains to be done in

educating the public on the connec-
tions between the lunacy ofthe arms
race. the heightened tensions in dif-
ferent parts of the world and the

miserable economic conditions in

which a significant proportion ofthe

world population lives.

The complexity of the goals the

movement seeks to accomplish
demands an extraordinary variety in
tactics and the decentralized nature
of its functioning makes it almost
imperative.

The callousness with which you
refer to hunger strikers as hurting
nobody except themselves and their
families and how nobody else cares
about them is unbecoming ofa cam-

You are quick to criticize: “...they
need to reﬂect on their activism and
radicalism,” but you fail to suggest
an alternative to this demonstrative
quality other than outright passiv-
ity. You merely state, “They need to
gain support in a more subtle way
and sway the country over to their
side." What do you propose is a bet-

"ter way? Or do you propose any way
at all? Please enlighten us for the
peace of mankind.

Frankly, I am appalled by your
passive, conservative attitude. Are
you not suggesting the nuclear arms
race is less radical than any radical

pus newspaper. I would have nor-
mally expected to see such a
statement in a fascist tabloid. I, for
one, care about them and would
challenge you to take a university-
wide poll to see how many in our
community really care. You may be
in for a surprise. provided the issues
are presented in proper perspective.
T he function of an editorial is to do
exactly that. Unfortunately, you
don’t seem to measure up to that
task.

It would have been interesting if
you had cared to elaborate on the
“more subtle way to sway the coun-
try" you had in mind, so that the
Rockwells. the Westinghouses and
the Reagans would listen. Maybe
the peace activists could have
learned something from your sug-
gestions. l can only hope that you
are not referring to 30-second com-
mercials on prime time TV.

form of demonstration against this
insane weaponry build-up? The ludi-

but they are taking it too far" is pre-
posterous. Too far? Are you imply-
ing that the Reagan administration's
inhumane build-up of nuclear wea-

Novak said. “When he said that, I

Flavor To Spikers

By LAURIE KUBLI

Summer's over but far from for-
gotten. This is especially true for
Carmen Tapia. middle blocker for
Pitt's women's volleyball team. The
5-1 l‘sophomore, who is a starter on
the Puerto Rican National Team,
led San Juan to a second-place finish
at the Puerto Rican championships
this summer.

Upon her return to Pitt, however,
Tapia experienced some difficulty
‘eadjusting to the America version
of power volleyball. “Back home,"
:he spiker said," it's not the same
;ystem. We used different
techniques."

Despite this apparent problem,
Tapia was the recipient of the
Coaches‘ Award for “consistency.
attitude and performance" and is
considered a valuable asset to Pitt
volley ball. According to head coach
Shelton Collier, “Last year, Carmen
was probably our most consistent
and durable player. She was our
only player to start every match last
year and is continuing this year with
18 of 18 starts.

“This is in a sport where minor
injuries are common." said Collier,
who also maintained that his depen-
dable middle blocker was short-
changed. “Last year, she was left off
of several All-Tournament teams,
and 1 felt she deserved first team
All-Big East, as well as several other
tournaments.“

Speaking of last year, Pitt won the
Big East championships. This year,
the team is a less-experienced one,
having no seniors.“lt's different, [1
have] more responsibility." Tapia
said. “Last year we had stronger
players, and now our team is much
younger,“

Although Pitt has an exciting,
urban campus and a fast nightlife,
those are not the reasons why Tapia
chose to come to Oakland. “It's the
Players," she maintained. “They're

1/cry nge, and that is why I came

'.".9~.'!‘-. -.- . -. :~.- .‘ J . .1 . . _

Collier said this about Tapia: “I
think the quality I admire most in
her is her perceptiveness; in the game
and socially, she-relates well with
other people. She understands the
situation and knows how to handle
herself very well."

lapia chose Pitt over Ohio State
and Houston after visits to all three
campuses.

“It came down to Houston and
Pitt, and 1 think two days before the
deadline, she made her decision.
We're hapy to have her here. She
and Regina [Reys] are major con-
tributors to our program.“ Collier
said.

The squad, 14-2 on the year. has
not had an easy schedule, and Col-
lier likes to put Tapia up against the
oppositions best hitters.

“Another role is that we match her
up against the other team's spiker in
order to give her an opportunity to
block their best spiker as many times
as possible." Collier said. “So far.
the strategy has been effective.

“Carmen plays proportionately
better to the player she's up against.
Playing against their top spiker mo-
tivates her to a real good perfor-
manee."

Tapia agreed that the better the.

opposition's performance. the better
hers will be.

"1 think that the level of competi-
tion affects my motivation," Tapia
said. “You have to pressure yourself
to play better. It's very good to play
against top teams; 1 think we should
play more of them. We prove to our-
selves that we are good by playing
high caliber teams.

“You have to prepare yourself to
fight for every point."

"A lot oftimes, I'll be working her
extremely hard in a practice, she will
offer a number of Spanish cliches.

During the game, athletes must
fight for every point,but practice is
where the team must make its prepa-
ration for the fight.

Spikers Priming Timing, Ready For BE Showdown.

By MARK A. SINDLER

The tri-match could not have been
scheduled in a better spot on the
schedule. Preparing for its first Big
East showdown this weekend, the
Pitt women's volleyball team
cranked out big, but uncomplicated,
victories in matches against Young-
stown State and Duquesne last
evening.

Playing on the Duchesses’ home
court, the Lady Panthers first
trounced Youngstown State 15-1.
15-5, 15-9. Afterward, Duquesne fell
15-6, 15-1, 15-1.

“We kept going all night long,“
Coach Shelton Collier said, as he
saw the team's match record climb
to 16-2. “As we go along, we need
very few mistakes, and tonight, we
played near flawlessly."

The third year in a row Pitt has
played in the tri-match. nothing
changed from years past. Nothing,
that is, except that Collier started
only freshmen and sophomores.
And never made a substitution.

That was nothing extraordinary.
Setter Cathy Rupp and outside hit-
ter Pat Belcher, bothjuniors, did not
even dress for the tri-match. Rupp is
down and out with a badly sprained
ankle, while Be1cher's determinedly
forcing a right knee back into shape
after off-season surgery.

Another setter. Judy Young, sat
out, too, with a sprained ankle, gear-
ing up for a fireworks showdown in
the Purdue Classic in 10 days.

“A lot ofplayers did some individ-
ual things that were extremely
good." Collier said.

That's the key as the Lady Panth-
ers are scheduled to visit Seton Hall
this weekend for Big East Southern
Division competition against Villan-

In anticipation ofthis, Collier solely
used freshmen and sophomores in
the “exhibition play" last night.

Freshmen Sue Hoover and Kris
Wexell, both displaying wicked net-
side outside hitting, played in the
two matches with sophomores Sally
Gillespie — setting a 5-1 offense -
Regina Reyes and Carmen Tapia.

Harriers Run Over Local Teams

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Despite a severe lack of competi-
tion on Saturday, several Panther
harriers turned in noteworthy
performances.

Senior Todd Colas set a Robert
Morris course record of 24:48 for the
five-mile distance as Pitt shut out
both the Colonials and the Dukes of
Duquesne by identical scores of 15-
50.

The Panthers grabbed the top
seven positions.

Behind Colas were senior Bill
Moorhead (25:10), freshman John
Thomas (25:17), senior Tom Bailey
(25:44), freshman Jay Coughenour
(20:02), junior Mickey Rihtarchik
(26:07) and freshman Mike Doll
(26:09).

“It was a pretty good team perfor-
mance," Panther John Vasvary said.
“We've made a big improvement
over where we were at this point in
the season a year ago, though we
weren't a very good team a year
ago."

The time gap between the No. 1
(Colas) and the No. 7 man (Mike
hall.)-_._ whinh is r-nritirlc-rr-rl tn the

The intended strategy was
obvious. Pitt will be squaring off
against Georgetown for the first
time since the Lady Hoyas were
trounced by Pitt in their last meet-
ing. A friendly one or memorable
one it wasn't for the D.C.-based
squad.

“I'm going to demand that our
team dominates the tournament,"
Collier said. “We want to leave no
doubt that amongst all the teams, we
are the best in the conference."

Gerogetown remembers all too
well. When all was said and done last
November at Providence College in
the Big East championship match,
the Lady Hoyas had nothing sub-
stantial to show for how far they had
come.

Playing, it can fairly be said, for
their lives, the Lady Hoyas

advanced to the ﬁnal round against
Pitt on that fateful day otherwise
known as Nov. 14. Before matching
slams with Pitt, Georgetown had
sliced through earlier competition
like a searing knife through butter.

But none of that mattered. A port-
entous NCAA bid stood within
reach, still to be wrested away. The
Lady Panthers played a number on
Georgetown and their banjo, strum-
ming their way to a shutout-match
victory. Hands down.

Revenge will now cut a laser-like
swath across the net when the Lady
Hoyas meet Pitt in what is slowly
materializing into a rivalry nearing
the status held by Penn State.

Records seemingly accurate indi-
cations, Georgetown is far from
anticipating any revengeful

crucial in a team's success, according
to Vasvary -—~ was 1:17, about a half
a minute from where he would like it
to be.

“We're shooting for a 50-second
gap from No. 1 to No. 7,“ he said. “I
think we can do it. We‘vejust got to
continue improving. On Saturday,
we hung tough together. Our guys
were running together. That‘s
important when it comes to forming
a decent team.

“We‘re far from beinga good Div-
ision 1 team right now; it’sjust very
competitive. 1 think we'll do a lot
better at the conference meet [Big
East championships will be held the
weekend of Oct. 15] next month,
and our conference is about as tough
a cross country conference as there is
in the country."

Despite their lack of talent, both
the Dukes and Colonials improved
upon their season performances,
many by as much as a minute, Butch
Devlin of Duquesne, especially.

_ Though never exactly in conten-
tion with the Panther corps, he

-placed ‘ninth with‘ a ‘time of 26:572. -.- -..'

1n the immediate future, the
Panthers don't have any meets sche-
duled. As of this moment, the next
time that the Panthers will definitely
race is the Big East conference meet,
though a trip to the Akron lnvita-
tional on Oct. 8 is still a possibility.

“Right now, that meet [the Arkon
lnvitational] is still up in the air,"
Vasvary said. “If things get settled
quick, 1 would like to make the trip.
lt would serve as a good tune-up for
the Big East."

A big difference in the 1983
Panther squad is that of depth.

“A year ago, we were having trou-
ble getting seven guys who we had
some confidence in to run," Vasvary
said. “This year, we have a real battle
going on for the five, six and seven
spots on the team. It's important to
have those guys pushing for spots on
the team. It keeps everybody their
toes."

The Panthers will have to be on
their toes, especially if they don't
have the opportunity to compete
before the Big East meet and they

thoughts, to which a 24 match mark
will attest. There is even a new coach
at the helm. Former skipper Joe
McClure is out, and first-year man
Kin Ng is in.

The former Georgetown assistant
(for five years until 1979) lost only
one senior, which could prove to be
a big deficiency, and starts three.
Middle blocker Karen McGlothlin
and outside hitter Meredith
Zatorski — senior co-captains -
and setter Denise Green will be Ng’s
mainstays.

Especially after last season's
championship challenge. This year,
though, the squad has been turned
topsy-turvy against Temple,
Rutgers,
Princeton.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September 225, I985

The competition sounds meager,
but Ng pleads no contest this early.

“We’re making adjustments
now,” Ng continued. “In addition to
trying new things, my coaching style
differs from Joe's. Mostly it's
because of how I perceive the offense
and defense should be run.

“I would also like to get this team
to run a little faster offense than last
year."

Because of such intangibles, Ng
disallows any kind of revenge stuff
this weekend. Could be a ploy.

“I don't see it so much as a revenge
kind of thing," Ng remarked. “Actu-
ally we know that Pitt is the strong-
est team in the Big East.

“I wouldn't go so far to say it's
revenge. Perhaps later at the Big
East tournament, maybe revenge
then. But at this stage, no."

By then, Georgetown will be bet-

that is now obviously the favorite.
“We're still kind of finding our
way," Ng said. “All these early con-
tests force us to work out the bugs
and that type of thing."
Additionally, Ng and the Lady
Hoyas will attempt to find their way
without the guiding light of Nicole

Thomas Makes Transition

To Collegiate Competition

By CHARLIE O'HARA

" We're very pleased with John -
especially happy that he chose Pitt.
He's a winner. He comes from a
great high school program, and we

feel that he's going to have a really

positive effect on our program, "Pitt
cross country coach John Vasvary
of his freshman distance runner
John Thomas, following Saturday's
seasoning shutout victories over
crosstown foes Robert Morris and
Duquesne.

For Thomas, it was his debut as a
collegiate runner. He handled the
transition with the greatest of ease,
placing third with a five-mile clock-
ing of 25:17 behind Pitt seniors
Todd Colas and Bill Moorhead -
the team’s No. I and 2 men from the
I982 team.

“So far, it's been a great help to
have Todd and Bill to look to,” the
graduate of nearby Gateway High
School in Monroeville said.

The smooth transition to colle-
giate level competition was also
aided by the fact that much of pres-
sure of being the No. I man, as was
the case when Thomas led—Gateway
to the AAA state title a year ago, is
gone.

“There’s deﬁnitely a difference,"
he said. “It’s a lot easier to concen-
trate. I don’t have to worry about
beating a particular man right now,
but in high school, many times I was
under the impression that I had to
beat another team's No. l guy or we
wouldn’t have much of a chance.“

There wasn’t the type of competi-
tion present in the first meet on Sat-
urday that should scare even a
freshman, but nontheless, a season
opener for a freshman is often
enough to start the butterflies.

“I was very surprised at how
relaxed I was," he said. “I didn’t
know what to expect; that may have
helped as much as anything. I’m
pleased though, I can't complain
about my performance. [Now], all I
have to do is improve.”

Improvement is definitely on the
list of priorites that Vasvary has set
for Thomas.

“He has the capability to become
better,” Vasvary said. “He's a good
hard worker, suprisingly enough, a
leader in workouts, where the
majority of our guys are upperclass-
men. He has a whole lot to learn, but
he seems willing to accept the chal-
lenge to become a good, solid
runner."

In contrast to all that he has going
for him, Thomas has been caught in
a less-than-enviable situation to
start the season.

“Somewhere along the line there
was a bit of a mix-up with room
assignments," Vasvary said. “John
has had the misfortune of not being
able to get a room on campus. Thus,
he’s been stuck with commuting
from Monroeville each day, an
obvious time conflict with his stu-
dies and his running.”

“It's been especially tough on me
as far as my studies are concerned,"
Thomas said. “Aside from the day
that I had my clothes stolen from the
car — causing me to miss practice -
it really hasn’t affected my training
much."

Whenever the situation is finally
straightened out, Thomas’ concen-
tration will be that much more clear-
cut. In the mean time, he'lljust have
to cope, hopefully with the success
that the early season has brought
him.

HARRIER NOTES: Senior Gar-
land Brown, who missed the season
opener, is still out with sore Achille’s
tendons. Vasvary is still unsure

are the only Division 1 teams in the
Pittsburgh area....In the third por-
tion of the tri-meet, Duquesne
defeated Robert Morris 23-
32....Despite the fact that last year’s
season finale was the Big East meet,
the I983 Panthers have scheduled
the Intercollegiate_Amateur Athletic

ships and the NCAA championships
as a part ofthe slate with the idea of
a significant performance in 1983 in
mind.
