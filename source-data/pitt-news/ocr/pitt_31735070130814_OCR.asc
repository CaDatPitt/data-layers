But the fraternity is not new to Pitt. _

The 85-year-old brotherhood was recently added
to IFC ‘after being unrecognized for two years.

In October 1998, the IFC revoked Kappa.Sigma’s _ 0‘

membership because it was in violation of University

“The rule is basically there to keep the fraternities .
close to each other and on the hill,” said Director of
Student Activities Joe Cavalla.

“We were in our house for a fewmonths when we
found out about the rule. We couldn’t do much about it
because we were already stuck with the lease,” said
Kappa Sigma president Al McLaughlin. .

A collaboration of University .

Democrats, College Republicans
and Student Government Board
committee members was on hand

. last night at the ‘World Wrestling

Federation. Smackdown in the
Mellon Arena. The groups spent the
evening registering voters for -the
upcoming presidential. election.

._ The event, sponsored by the
WWF along with Youth Vote 2000, -

has been touring the country‘ advo-

» eating voter registration, speciﬁcall

So far the WWF and Youth Vote

2000 have been successful in regis-..
V tering nea_rly~92,000 people to vote.
‘Penn State hosted a similar event,

during which more than 900 -voters
were registered. ‘ University

Democrat Stephanie .Strazisar said

she hopes last night’s event topped
Penn State’s performance. “
 “Oh no, it’s not just about foot-

ball anymore,” she said.

All three organizations became

involved with the event after they .

were contacted by a Youth Vote 2000

representative. Last night served as _

one of the many ways University
Democrats, College Republicans

and ‘Student Government Board.

have registered voters this year.

, Expectations were high among
volunteers as they aimed. to ﬁll-all
1,800 registration forms they
brought

“We’re expecting a good turnout
thanks _to «the sold-out crowd
tonight,” he said. . . C K

Also excited about the night’s 0

event was Rogette Harris, the educa-

. Harris said. “It’s so exciting‘ and a
great opportunity. to" get youth ,

involved.” , . . . .

To reachtheir goal, volunteers
scattered themselves -throughout the
ﬁrst level of the arena, approaching

‘people with clipboards. Volunteers

were also located at a table near the
main entrance.

V Among those" registering was 7
Pitt freshman Justin Wyant, who
heldhis “I cried with Kurt” (refer-

, Along with registering to vote,
spectators were asked to sign aYouth
Vote 2000 petition intending to set
up a youth-oriented debate between
presidential nominees George .W.
Bush and Al Gore. A location and

mediator are yet to be determined, «

should the petition be successful.

moting voter registration is not the

A presidential candidate visited Pittsburgh yester-
day, and it wasn’t Al Gore or George W. ‘Bush.

Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
was greeted with a standing ovation in the packed
Rangos Auditorium at Camegie Mellon University
where he gave a speech last night.

Students were able to obtain information, bumper
stickers, pins and large green Nader/LaDuke signs at an
information table outside the main entrance doors. -r

‘ In his speech to the CMU audience, Nader went
straight into the issues his campaign focuses on, such as
the working class, campaign ﬁnances, health care and
the environment. V A

Nader said he was very concerned about the size of
corporations morphing into large corporate conglomer-
ates

prevalent around the world but not in the United States.

ty, he Said .. G ‘ ' _ . .

energy right away,” Nader said.

“Universities have become trade schools,” he said.

enlighten critical minds. He said that students should use

sors or newspapers at their disposal.

He was not only a harsh critic of large corporations
and the government, but also of society in general. Nader
said he thought too many children are being raised by the
entertainment media and no one is making time for fam-
ily.

“Loneliness is the period of time between the cell
phone calls,” he said.

polls, he quickly responded, “The polls are rigged”

‘being Bell’s
dodgeball called “six-man may-.

The Pitt News

Dodgeball enthusiasts now have
an outlet to satisfy their desires.
_ Nathan Bell, the official founder

- and president of Pitt’s first dodge-

ball. club, has been working on
starting the club since the idea

occurred to him last spring.

“One day in class, I said that I
wish there was a dodgeball club,
and people said ‘Yeah!”’ Bell said.

This spontaneous ’ and casual
reference eventually became a plan
to create an organization devoted
exclusively to playing dodgeball.

“I came up with the idea kind of
late in the year,’.’ Bell ‘admitted.
“Before I knew it, summer‘ had
come and the school year was over.”

Nonetheless, Bell began this
school year with the intention of
achieving last yc.ar”s goal.

In the beginning, the team was-

in’t all funand games for Bell.

Creating the club took time and
effort until I Pitt’s Activities

Committee gave its approval and

the club could become official.

First, a form had to be complet-
ed by an advisor or staff member, at
least 10 members had to be willing
to join and a constitution had to be
written. '

In order to attract Pitt students ,

to join the team, Bell advertised his

idea by crcatingrfliers‘ and posting»

them around campus.

I With the paperwork complete
and players lined up, Bell can start
the actual games. ' A

Last week, six people arrived at if

a racquetball court in Trees Hall for
the first two games, which’-endedup
own variation of

hem.” V A . -
According to Bell, the game is a
points—based variation’ of dodgeball

opens at Pitt 

with‘ two thrce—player teams.

Hitting an opposing player with the-

ball or catching a ball in ﬂight
results in‘ one point. The game is

_scored by referees, and the‘ first

team to reach 10 points is the win-
ner. , .

“It is a very intense game and
everyone loves it,” Bell said. “It
just keeps on going until we all get
tired and decide to get some food.”

Fifty-two students of all ages
havealready signed up to be active

,members of the dodgeball club, of

many of whom were attracted sim-
ply by word of mouth. However,
scheduling conflicts prevented
many students from attending the
first two games. = —

’ In the future, Bell hopes to.
become more organized and possi-
bly designate Sundays as the’offi-

‘cial game day;

“We could really play a kickin’
dodgeball game if more people
show up,” Bell. said. “Anyone is
welcome tocomer and is encouraged
to bring friends.” -. . V

Bell"s encouragement to talk to
people about the club is further stat-

ed in the ,club’s “unofficial” rules..

The first rule is, “You must talk

about Dodgeball Club.” The second

rule reads, “You MUST talk about
Dodgeball Club and tell’ all your
friends.” _

Bell believes that the ‘dodgeball
club ‘will’ eventually develop into a

large, organization and hopes to '

someday have tournaments and pos-

the winning team. .
“Dodgeball is a classic game

sibly award a golden dodgeball to

being brought back,” Bell said.

“The sky is the limit-!” A. V
The next dodgeball game will

be held on Sunday at 4:00pm. at

Trees Hall. Interested students can

EDITORIAL

Dodgeball club sets   a great
example for having fun

It’s exciting that the football
team is thus far undefeated and the
men’s soccer team is ranked 14th in‘
the nation, but the best news in Pitt
athletics may very well be some-
thing that happened last week, deep
in the bowels of Trees Hall. There,
on the hallowed ground of a rac-
quetball court, six people met to
engage in a challenging contest  of
dodgeball.

Remember second grade, when
all your fantasies revolved around
hurling a big squishy ball with such
remarkable aim that you single-
handedly wiped out all the members
of the opposing team and became a
gym class hero? Nathan Bell,
founder of the newly formed Pitt
dodgeball club, is giving students
the chance to relive those memories ‘
and at last fulﬁll all their dodgeball
dreams. .

It is a shame that only six people
turned V out for the club’s_ first -
engagement, as the cliche “the more
the merrier” most likely evolved
speciﬁcally with regard to the game
of dodgeball. Perhaps the hike to
Trees was- too daunting for many a
potential hurler.

There is a simple solution —
hold dodgeball games in ~ Posvar
Hall. This way, students and faculty

‘academic stress. '

passing by on their way to class can
be sucked into games, perhaps vol-
untarily or perhaps by “force.
Ongoing games in this location will
provide stressed students with a
healthful and immediate outlet for

But why stop with dodgeball?
There are many great games that
most of us A haven’t played since
childhood, games that would_make
for good cheap wholesome fun if
only we had the courage and organi— ,
zational, skills to reinstate them.
Surely_many would reap consider-
able joy from membership in red
rover or duck-duck—goose societies.

Kickball, a game often forgotten
by those over age 10, is beautiful in
its simplicity. In contrast, matball --
a version of kickball that involves

oversized bases: which you have to 7

round twice, and can bestolen at any
time — is cool in its craziness.
Flashlight Tag on the Cathedral
Lawn club, Capture the Flag club,
Roll Down Flagstaff Hill and Spin
Yourself Dizzy club — the possibil-
ities are virtually endless. We can
only hope that others will follow
Bell’s example‘ of enhancing our
college years by injecting the Pitt
landscape with a big dose of little-
kid fun. ’ . ,

Acknowledging bi-service veterans  

In my two years as a columnist for the Pitt
News, I have been proud to act as an advocate
for veterans’ concerns. -In addition, I have
enjoyed attending events and surﬁng Web sites
that deal with veterans’ issues. But in all this
time and research I have yet to encounter any
attention given to a particular type of veteran,

who I will call the “bi-service” veteran.
Bi-service veterans are those individuals
who have served in two different branches of
the United States’ uniformed fed-
eral services. I know a little about
 phenomenon, being a bi-ser-
vice vet myself — after many
years in the Naval Reserve, I
transferred to the Army Reserve in
1996 and have served in the reserve ever since.
‘ In my four-‘plus years in the Army Reserve,

_ I have discovered that bi-service veterans are

more common than one might think At one
point, my unit contained individuals with prior

. service in the Navy, Air_Force, Marine Corps

and Coast Guard. .

Each bi-service vet has a unique. story and

different reasons for switching services. I think
it is wrong to stereotype people like myself as
ﬂighty or O disloyal to our original uniform.
Besides, all of us in the ‘federal uniformed ser-
vices are part of the same team; ultimately, we
obey orders passed down from the same com-
mander in chief. g 4 n I g
. Of course, switching services can be daunt-
ing. Although all branches share core values
and other common concerns, to a degree each
service is a unique subculture unto itself. "I often
compare switching services to converting to

V another religion or marrying‘ into a family with -
a very different cultural background, for you

have to learn a whole new “language” and new
traditions. .

And of course, there are the hard-core‘ prac-
tical concerns," such as getting new uniforms
and training for the tasks unique to your new

'  And there are all sorts of questions and

conundrums that pop up: Can I wear the rib-

bons and badges from my former service on my
new uniform? And if I can, where do I put
them? For whom do I root during the Army-
Navy football game? 4

Of course, sometimes your bi-service
background can result in humorous or embar-
rassing situations. I’ll never forget one promo-J

‘ tion ceremony at my Army Reserve unit, during
‘ which my battalion" commander pinned collar

 onto two new sergeants. After the, cer-

“ emony the troops had to stiﬂe some
giggles at the fact that the newly
promoted sergeant’s insignia was
on upside down!

But it made perfect sense to
me, for our battalion commander
had previously served in the Coast Guard. And
I remembered that the Coast Guard, likethe
Navy, wears its chevrons (the V-shaped stripes
that make up enlisted rank insignia) with the-
point down, while the Army, in contrast, wears

’ them point up. So I surmised that the comman-

der had a “Coast Guard ﬂashbac ” during the
ceremony and instinctively pinned the insignia
point-down._

Like most bi-s_ervice— vets, my choice to '
switch services doesnot reﬂect any negative ’ _i

feeling toward my previous branch of service.
In fact, I still lovethe Navy andproudly keep
my Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal

" inacase withall ofmyArrny awards and dec- ,*
orations. And when I was commissioned a sec- - 7

0nd lieutenant earlier this year, I chose to have
a naval oﬂicer adrninister the oath of oﬁiceto
me. .

. I always encourage Americans to remem-
ber and honor the services rendered by veter-,
ans. So now I ask you to also__remember the
unique challenges faced and goals achievedby

the community of bi-service veterans. Maybe

one day- ‘we’ll even form our own veterans
group! ‘

And just when it seems things couldn’t
be any worse for the Rutgers football team,
they are. '

’ The Scarlet Knights are coming off '

Saturday’s 29-17 loss to Pitt in what Rutgers

all-around champion this past year. .

One of Goldberg’s club teammates
was junior Raya Mullin, with whom she
rejoins as a member of the Panthers.

“Raya was real helpful, because it was
good to know someone,” Goldberg said. “I
loved everything about Pitt when I came
here on my recruiting trip.”

Goldberg considered North Carolina
State, New Hampshire, Rutgers and
Massachusetts before deciding on Pitt.

All four schools competed against Pitt
at some point during the 2000 season. »

“We’re going up against schools in the
EAGL for recruits, especially North
Carolina State,” Yohman said. , -

She also said that Pitt loses most of the
battles with the Wolfpack because of the
poor facilities. V

“If a gymnast has narrowed her choic-
es to Pitt and another school and the decid-
ing factor is facilities, we lose every single
time,” Yohman said.

Pitt has most "of its home meets in
Fitzgerald Field House, but several times
in the past two seasons, the team has_ been
forced to move to Trees Hall because of
scheduling conﬂicts with the Big East
Conference in basketball.

The equipment that Pitt uses must be
set up every day before practice and for
meets, something that teams at every level
of gymnastics stopped doing about 30
years ago, according to Yohman.

Yohman has discussed the problem
with Athletic Director Steve Pederson, and

she said that Pederson is well aware of the
problems facing the program.

“He wonders how I do it, bringing in
gynmasts with what we have,” Yohman

A said. T _
O’Connor is. the most intriguing

recruit, considering she is from Tulsa,
Okla.

As a member of Krafft Academy, she

won the Oklahoma state championships as
well as the Region 3 championship, which

consists of clubs ﬁom Oklahoma, Texas, '

Arkansas and Kansas.

Yohman was familiar with
O’Connor’s club coach and said that the
gy1nnast’s father and sister did all the
recruiting. _

. O’Connor considered Boise State and
Missouri, but chose the Panthers in the
end. .

Just two months ago, however,
O’Connor broke’ her foot and is just now
returning to conditioning. ‘ _

“It’s hard to predict. where she’ll be
once the season begins, so we have to be
real careful with her,” Yohman said.

That is the risk Yohman has to take
with recruits, because the signing period is
before the beginning of the ﬁnal club sea-

prominent role in the recruiting of thefour
gymnasts as well, but he took a job with
the University of Michigan in July.

The Wolverines have one of the top

that fact is not lost on Yohman. . -
_‘ ‘I don’t like losing my assistant coach-
es, but it means Pitt isgheading in the right
direction and I’m doing my job well also,”
Yohman said. ' . \~

Scardina’s replacement, Ed Nyman,‘

Nyman was also aware" of Pitt’s poor

 

facilities, but he’ came from Ursinus

“Debbie says Pitt’s facilities are bad,

‘ but I came from worse,” Nyman said.
An immediate answer is unknown, but _

once the basketball teams move out of
Fitzgerald Field House, the team might get
a stable practice facility. ’

, Even so, Yohman was already work-
ing on recruiting for next season, but keep-
ing academics above all else.

“My kids are not majoring in gyrrmas—

Oneof the first questions she asks is '
what major the gymnasts are goingto pur- '
~ sue and whether they are good, students.
