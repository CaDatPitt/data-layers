Review: Sex hurts

' WILL SCHEFF
Staff Writer

A recent review. of Pitt’s communica-

‘ tion department describes an atmosphere

in which “senior faculty routinely and:
repeatedly have engaged in consensual
sexual relationships with - graduate stu-

‘ dents.”

And one male source within the
department, who wished to remain anony-
mous, said that an effort is underway‘ to
silence people about the report’s ﬁndings.

But the report also praises the depart-
ment, calling it “healthy  by virtually
any relevant criterion.”

A male facultyarnember, speaking on
condition of anonyi-ﬁity,i said he was “sur-‘
prised” by the report. The -person

remarked that the juxtaposition of praise
and criticism is “confusing,” especially
since he was unaware of both the activity
described in the report, and of any attempt
by those within the department to silence
others. ' S‘

calling in graduate students to speak with
legal counsel about their relationships
with faculty and other members of the
department. This angered one female
graduate student, who spoke on the condi-
tion of anonymity.

“I don’t understand how the
University can do this,” she said. “This is
a debacle. It’s a witch—hunt. This isn’t an
environment that’s hostile towards

Despite petitions, professor loses job

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor ‘

Some Pitt students got a  when

“registering for next fall’s classes: a popular
ﬁlm studies professor, Moya Luckett, did not

have any classes.

When they learned that Luckett had
been denied tenure and would not be at Pitt
next year, many ﬁlm studies students -
both those who had taken Luckett’s classes
and those who had planned to‘ — organized
to write and circulate a petition requesting

' that the decision bereconsidered.

“We feel that she is a vital, energizing
force in the ﬁlm studies program speciﬁcal-
ly, and‘ in the English department generally,”
the students wrote. “She has nurtured many

, of us towards a greater understanding of ﬁlm

analysis through the kindness of her ‘radiant,
energetic being. She is a force of nature’ that
will be hard to replace and sorely missedby
all!”' v V V

About 160 students, many. enrolled in
one of Luckett’s classes this semester, signed
the petition. ’ P ‘

Film studies major Eric Lidji empha-

V sized that Luckett did not request or suggest

any of the ‘actions taken by the students.
Luckett reported that shefelt touched by the
students’ response, despite her reluctance to.

, tell them she was leaving.

Luckett admired by students

For Luckett’s students, her departure is
still diﬂicult to accept and understand.

“It’s hard to tell what their reasoning
was,” said Lidji, who has taken six classes
with Luckett. . S .

In addition to the petition, which the stu-
dents photocopied and sent to Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg, Provost James Maher

A and Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences

John Cooper, Lidji wrote his own letter to the
three administrators. ' S
“Nordenberg basically said that he

7 appreciated the letter, but [that] it was a mat-
. ter for Dean Cooper,” Lidji said, adding that
Cooper responded and explained he could’

not release informationabout employment
decisions. 1
Lidji said Cooper’s response asked him

to “rest assured” that ﬂie deciding individu- .

als and committees did their best to follow
procedures and make a good decision. While
he said he understood issues of conﬁdential-

ity as they pertained to protecting a profes— r

sor’s right to privacy, Lidji feels that, in some
situations, conﬁdentiality could hurt some
candidates who are not granted tenure, with
no public explanation. _ ' .

The decision not to grant Luckett tenure

will almost certainly hurt ﬂre department, in -

Lidji’s opinion.

“If it didn’t [hurt the department], it
would show a great deal for the ﬁlm studies
people, that they could pull out if it,” he said.

Philip. Wion knows that gaining
tenure is a “very signiﬁcant point in a
person’s career.” 

He also knows that the process of
gaining tenure relies on many individual,

Dean of the School of Arts and

couldn’t comment on what is understood

raised in the report, and that work is ongo-
ing. I would conﬁrm that there is an exter-
nal review process, but their report is con-
ﬁdential. When we receive a comprehen-
sive report, a seiies of further intemal
steps need to be taken before we can form
any conclusions based on that report.”

“Any report of that sort triggers an
internal process,” Fedele continued.
"These processes provide a context with
which to read the document.”

A‘ second female graduate student
said that she wasn't aware of anyVprob-
lems whatsoever.

“I have ‘a great deal of respect for all
of the faculty here,” she said. “This is a

  

 
   
      

       
       
   

comfortable environment.” -
The Pitt News obtained a copy of the

document, which begins by givinghigh 1
marks to many aspects of the communica- :
tion department, from a source who ‘

refused to go on record. .

“By virtually any relevant criterion,
the department today is healthy and sig-
niﬁcantly improved since its last review,”
the report reads. “It has a strong research
culture J. .. it is most known in the areas of
rhetoric and public policy, rhetoric of sci-

ence, and public argument  it has main- A

tamed a vigorous teaching culture  In
these ways, it participates in the
University’s vision of a community of
scholars.” : I-

The report also praises Lyne. '

“The department chair, John Lyne,
deserves considerable credit , for the
department’s strengthened position.
Support for his leadership among his col-

I

leagues is broad and deep. His perceived .

fairness and his broadly consultative lead-
ership style have contributed to signiﬁcant
healing of many of the rifts of the past.”
But the report also says, in a section,
titled “the faculty culture” on page 4, that
the department “is a culture in which
senior faculty routinely and repeatedly

A have engaged in consensual sexual rela-

tionships with graduate students, and this
has been tolerated as usual and acceptable.
The routine character of. these relation-
ships silences other faculty and graduate
students. Female graduate students

.describe the culture as unsafe, that is,

requiring alertness, maturity, and sophisti-

' cation in handling approaches by faculty

or coping with hostile acts (e.g., pornogra-

phy left on desktop computers in graduate

ofﬁces.)” .

The report then goes on to name other
issues stemming. ‘from the situation it
describes. .

“This environment contributes direct-
ly to the problem of promoting and tenur-
ing women faculty and. faculty of color.
Resistance to diversity generally, and to
admitting minority graduate students, are
reportedly part of this culture, as is vocal
espousal of views against diversity efforts
in classes. and as members of departmen-

- tal committees. Allegedly, the handling of

past cases of sexual harassment by the
-University’s legal counsel may have con-

tributed to the poor departmental climate.” A

The report also recommends actions
to address the “issuespit raises.

A “Strategies to avoid diversity may,
include constructing job descriptions to
focus on areas in which there are few
women or [minority scholars, or to apply

tenure and promotion criteria differential-'

ly. Deans should provide oversight so that

standards are not applied differentially,

especially in the cases of women or facul-
ty of color.”

Denial of Luckett’s tenure application surprises colleagues

Luckett, page 1

About a dozen ﬁlm studies students contacted The Pitt
News to report their support for Luckett. Jason Bower, who
has taken three of Luckett’s classes, Called to say that she is
5‘probably worth more than a stupid Pitt panther statue and a
Petersen Events Center.”

Cooper denied application

During the process of seeking tenure, Luckett reported,
she received the support of all but one of the 40 to 50 tenured
professors in the English department, which houses the ﬁlm
studies program. After gaining support from the department,
Lucketfs ﬁle proceeded to an ad hoc committee of six
tenured professors from outside the department This com-

When her ﬁle reached the next step — the dean of her
school’s desk — Cooper turned it down.
While Cooper said he could not comment on LucketI’s

_ case, in keeping with a general University policy to not com-

ment on personnel decisions, he explained his role in the nor-
mal tenure decision process.

“It’s unusual for me to overturn a recommendation, but
it happens a couple of times a year,” Cooper said, adding that

he usually reviews between 15 and 20 tenure applicants each

In reviewing a candidate for tenure, faculty and admin-

‘There is good evidenceof progress
in this area. Recent hires’ have enhanced
the diversity of ‘the faculty, and the new
Director of Graduate Studies, Ron
Zboray, is actively recruiting a diverse
graduate student cohort. But further
efforts are needed.”

The report also makes further recom-
mendations. . A

“Our . experience suggests that the
full-time presence of senior women and
minority faculty members in the depart-

problems and also to provide role models
for students. We recommend that Dean
Cooper authorize hiring at a senior level
(Associate or Full Professor) for the posi-
tion now vacant, if the department can
present a clear strategic rationale and
description for the position and if the
department can identify a qualiﬁed

recommendation] letters, when they found out I hadn’t got-
ten tenure, called me and said, ‘What happened?” she said.
“Normally, the dean just rubber stamps the ad hoc comrnit-
tee’s recommendation.” A .

Philip Wion, a tenured professor in the English depart-
ment who sits on the University Planning and Budgeting
Committee, said that administrators and faculty members
sometimes disagree about who should receive tenure.

“It’s not the ﬁrst time this department, or other depart-
ments, have supported a candidate, and been overruled high-
er up,” Wion said.

Decision reversals are rare, Wion said, explaining that
those reversals were “probably not as a result of student
protest or demonstration of support.” . - '

V Although Cooper’s reconsideration of Luckett’s ﬁle did
not change his decision, he sent her a second letter, explain-
ing that the ﬁrst was not meant to come as an attack, Luckett
said.

“[Cooper wrote] that my teaching and service were
great, and he’d never intended [the ﬁrst letter] to be that
way,” she said, addingthat she was nevertheless told her
application was hurt because she had taught “too many
undergraduate courses.”

In her seven years at Pitt, Luckett has taught 14 different

undergraduate courses, which she said is “more than most
people teach.” She taught for two years at the University of
Houston before coming to Pitt ‘ _
V Luckett said that she has attended many conferences,
published 13 or 14 articles in her career and edited a ﬁlm
anthology. Her ﬁrst book has not yet been published, how-
ever, and she said she thinks that also hurt her chances.

Wion, who has been at Pitt for more than 30 years, said
that the number and quality of a candidate’s publications
have become more important during the past several
decades. ‘

Luckett did not ﬁle an appeal because, she said, an

appeal tackles only the issue of whether ornot someone,

broke the rules in the tenure evaluation process, and not the
question of whether the decision was a good one.

“A colleague who had been through [the appeal process]
said it was akin to a rape trial,” Luckett added.

Students want to keep Luckett, in any capacity «
Although the students’ petition requested that Luckett be
reconsidered for tenure, many said that they would be happy
to keep Luckett at Pitt in any capacity possible — even with-
out tenure. While Luckett said that she would want to stay for

the time being, whether or not she received tenure, she point-V

ed out that it would not be a long-term solution.

“It’s unlikely in this ﬁnancial climate that I will be able
to get that kind of work,” Luckett said of ﬁnding a full-time
job as a ‘professor. She added that she might teach a few
classes and look for a part-time job instead. 

Lidji suggested that there is little middle ground “left by
the tenure “up or out’ guideline, which prevents professors
who are denied tenure from staying at a university for more
than seven years. — a

David Bartholomae, chair of the English department,
did not return phone callsfor comment 

Tenure important for academic freedom
For professors, the  of being kept on forever is a

1 very desirable deal.

Wion explained the signiﬁcance and importance of
tenure.

Tenure “essentially protects peop1e’s academic ﬂee-
dom,” VV1on said. “Once people are tenured, they can only
be dismissed for due cause.” 1

According to the American Association of University
Professors, which set the guidelines for tenure in the 1940
Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure,
the probationary period in which a full-time professor occu-
pies a tenure-track position “should not exceed seven years.”
Though representatives of the AAUP say they do not active-
ly enforce this rule, they do recommend it, and Wion says it
is “pretty generally accep .”

For professors whose areas of interest or research incite V

controversy, tenure can give them the freedom to pursue
work that might otherwise threaten their jobs. ‘

Keeping a tenure-denied professor in a position at a uni-
versity can hurt both the professor and the university, accord-
ing to \V1on. - '1

“If [the professor is] not going to get that léind of status
at_ an institution, then they really need to go out [and ﬁnd‘ it
elsewhere],” hesaid. “To simply continue on would mean
taking up a position that should be opened for someone else.”

Usually, a department gives a speciﬁc number of tenure i

and tenure—track positions, so if a professor holding one of
those positions has been denied tenure, no other candidate
can pursue that tenure position. ~

Wron was positive about Luckett’s prospects of ﬁnding
work elsewhere, and he expressed hope that she will do well.

“Often,.it does happen that the person is able to ﬁnd a
position elsewhere,” he said. “[Being denied tenure is] a dev-
astating thing to go through, but it’s not the end of a profes-
sional life.” .

is a judgment itself,” he added. _

The tenure process, though it varies
between departments and universities,
follows general guidelines set by the
American Association of Professors.

A professor is usually considered for
tenure at the beginning of his sixth year.
Tenured professors in the candidate’s
department, as well as the chair of the
department, review the candidate on cri-
teria that usually include teaching, ser-
vices and published works. [Each person
makes a recommendation, which Will be
passed on to the next level of assessors.
At this stage, a negative vote will not halt
the process. ‘

An ad hoc committee, consisting of
about half aidozen professors from out-
side the candidates department, willthen
review the candidate and the previous
recommendations. The committee also
makes a recommendation, which is then
passed on to the dean of the candidate’s
school — in the case of Moya Luckett, a

ﬁlm studies professor who was recently .

denied tenure, School of Arts and
Sciences Dean John Cooper.
The dean, after examining the candi-
~date’s records and the recommendations
of the previous committees, makes a
decision about the candidate. An
approval passes on to the ‘provost, and
then the chancellor, for their approval. If

' the dean, the provost or the chancellor
does not approve the candidate’s applica- _

tion, the process is halted and the candi-
date is denied tenure.

In Luckett’s.case, the denial of tenure
came from Cooper, who said personnel
decisions are kept conﬁdential, and could
not comment on anything concerning

/Luckett’s case. i

A candidate denied tenure has sever-

al options. Choosing not to ﬁght the

denial, the candidate — who will, by the 1

_time she receives the denial or approval
of her tenure application, be approaching
the end of her sixth year — can serve out
a seventh year, h during which} she is
expected to look for a new place 0 work.

qualiﬁcations were overlooked, -. he can

request that the decision be reconsidered.
At this point, he would also submit any
additional information that he’ believed
would help her case.

Cooper said that reconsideration
requests “sometimes,” though not usual-
ly, result in a change in a tenure decision
for a candidate. _

If a candidate-believes someone has
failed to follow tenure procedures, she
can file an appeal. An appeal, however,
must be based on an actual lack of ‘due
process or» inadequate consideration,
Wion explained.

’ “It can’t just be, you know, ‘You
made the wrong decision,”’ Wion said.

After ﬁling and losing an appeal, the
professor has few alternatives to leaving
the University.

“[There are no alternatives to a] fail-
ing [appeal], other than a lawsuit —
which occasionally happens,‘ but it’s hard

to win one,” Wion said. “If som_ething,

really egregious is going on, and the
University is violating the 1940
Statement [of the Principles] on

Academic Freedom [and Tenure], the
[American Association of University
Professors] sometimes gets a request [to
get involved].”
But negative decisions ‘sometimes
create controversy, Wion said.
“Especially if the higher-level judg-

ment flies in the face of lower-level judg-
ments, there can be some questions,” he
said.

Despite the controversy that tenure
decisions can sometimes raise, Wion said
he feels the importance of tenure out-
weighs any problems.

“Tenure is a very, very important
institution, and it is periodically under
assault, too,” Wion said. “Its [purpose is]
to protect academic freedom and to allow
people to do research unfettered and
unconstrained.”

“A society in which there is not free-
dom to question and criticize is not a free
society,” he added. “I think the process,
on the whole, works well.’’

Communicating in poisoned atmosphere

In an external review of the commu-
nication department at Pitt, outside_eval—
uators have reported what they consid-
ered to be a disturbing culture in effect

I there.

The report, voluntarily commis-
sioned by Pitt and carried out by three
professors from other schools with noted
communication departments, states that,
while academics a‘r'E‘improving, lack of
and resistance to diversity is a problem,
as is an environment described by some
female graduate students as “unsafe.”

According to the report, graduate
students and senior faculty members reg-
ularly carry.on consensual sexual rela-
tionships, and these relationships
“silence” other faculty and students. The
report says, “hostile acts (e.g. pomogr_a-
phy left on desktop computers in gradu-
ate off1ces),” are also occurring. The
report also states that faculty members

' vocally oppose diversity efforts, and are

reportedly resistant to admitting minori-
ty graduate students. ‘ 

The report also mentioned that
junior faculty are made to shoulder so
much responsibility — teaching many
core undergraduate classes —‘ as to pos-
sibly impair their ability to get tenure. By
overburdening younger faculty, iliose
with tenure could be entrenching more
firmly the culture that the long-time
tenured faculty members seem to be per-
petuating.

..

The panel found that the department
is on an upswing, and that is good news,
and contributes to Pitt’s overall image
improvement. That makes it especially
troubling that some’ people in the depart-
ment are said to be mired in such archa-
ic and backward thinking. For the

department to ﬂourish and grow, such‘

attitudes, if they exist, must be rooted
out. I

Department Chair John Lyne would
not comment on the document, nor
would School of Arts and Sciences Dean
John Cooper. The report, which was con-
fidential, was obtained by a source
unwilling to comment on the record, and
no one at Pitt or elsewhere has confirmed
the report’s contents.

Clearly, no one wants to discuss

6 these embarrassing ﬁndings. But ignor-

ing them, or allowing" them to fester
behind closed doors, is not the way to ﬁx
them. That has seemingly been the order
of operation in the past, and it hasn’t

_ worked.

Based on the comments, —— support-
ive of the department,—- of two female
graduate students, it seems as though a
small numberof people —, not the larger
whole —-— are responsible for this alleged
mess. If that is the case, shedding light-
on the problem will expose the bad ele-
ments. Then, they will be forced to con-
sider the harm their alleged actions are
causing, and either change or be ﬁred.

My music is betterthan that crap you like

My music is better than yours.

Seriously. . ‘

I listen to way better music than you
do. I know you’re saying, “But, Arun, I am
down withthe underground scene and have
my ﬁnger to the pulse of what’s hip and
original.” To that, I say, “Not really, man.”

I know you may think you have a great
taste for cool music, but
really, the stuff you like is
just bands that are copying
and diluting the good stuff
I "like. Your bands aren’t
truly underground; they’re

and therefore diluted cor-
porate rubbish, whereas

_ even I haven’t actually

 

away whilst rolling my eyes at you. Of
course you can have your own opinion, but
I think it’s quite obvious, to me, at least, that
my opinion is way better than yours. Of
course you like those songs; it’s because
you have bad taste. Now if you had even
the slightest fraction of the taste I have, you
would 7 be ashamed at your previous»

attempts to appreciate music, ’

and I bet you would cry, hon-
estly. V M

I truly hope that there is
someone out there who under-
stands music ‘ like I do, but
unfortunately I don’t have the
resources that the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence
Institute has, so I doubt I will

In fact, Ithink I heard met a girl who didn’t like that

closed. ‘
Have I actually listened to the repro-
bates you call musicians? No. I don’t need

. to because I have heard it all before. Who

do I like? -

I don’t think I can tell you, because as
soon as more than three people know about
them, their integrity as a111'sts is shattered by
their expanding mainstream fan base.

Why am I such a tool?

Well, I’ll assume that, by ‘_‘too ,” you

mean All-Knowing God of iMusic. The “A

answer to that is_ simple — I just know
inherently what can be considered good
and what is clearly crap. I wasn’t taken in

A by T‘Beatlemania” because -The Beatles are
_ just puppets of mass marketing and are

simply unoriginal. You can’t make good
music in mop tops anyway, and all those
uninspired lyrics and worthless instrumen-
tation —- -

.Well, you still think “so and so” has -

some great songs? Isn’t everybody entitled,
to his or her own opinion?
Pssh. Please excuse me’ while I

pompously chuckle to myself and look

It has occurred to me that the average -

reader might be lost in awe and wonder-
ment at my talent and has accidentally
missed key points of this informative piece.
For them I shall sum it up: The music I like
is way better than yours.‘ Trust me.

The main point I want to emphasize is
(write this down, or enshrine this page) I
am really uniquely gifted. 9'

You might read this informative piece "

and think you know how I_sort and select
music. You don’t. So you should just stop.
Don’t buy? any new records; they’re all
garbage. Don’t talk about your opinions on
Beck. You understand him as much, a 3-
year-old spider monkey understands
“Donnie Darko.” And, most importantly,
stop listening to music, because your music
sucks. - . I

_, Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some
kindergarten music classes to sneer at for
their indoctrinated‘ and off-key versions of
unimaginative takes on the drivel that they A
refer to as songs. Word to your moms.

Lancaster County is morphing into a strip mall

Lancaster County — pronounced
Lan—caster by non-natives, for some
mysterious reason ~ is known for its
agriculture. i

Or, more specifically, it’s
known for its agriculturalists; host-
ing a landscape of hilly fields and
green meadows with red barns and
white silos under a sky that
remains, for much of the year, blue.

lt’s a region built by — and upon
— the Amish; traditionally moving a
little bit slower than most and with
more reflection.

If it comes up in conversation,
you might quickly associate it with
something old-fashioned, and a few
years ago, you might have been
right.

But with each trip home, I find
that things have changed just a little
more; that a land of cornfields and
fishin’ streams has come one step
closer to becoming a den of Best
Buys and overpasses.

In an Aug. 3, 2003 Philadelphia

Inquirer article, Chris Guy docu-
ments ‘how development in
Lancaster County is radically
changing the environment and forc-
ing Amish residents to move south
to places like Cecil, Md.: “Amish
farmers say development sprawl in
Lancaster County has pushed land
prices there to more than twice the
$3,000 to $4,000 an acre they have
paid for farmland in Cecil. And that
is when there is agricultural land to
be had.” '
‘Urban sprawl’ is an appropri-
ately‘ unflattering term — implying,
for instance, that Philadelphia
loosens its belt and the gut bounces
all the way to Harrisburg, absorbing

\

everything in between.

' A smaller—scale event
takes place when
Harrisburg unwinds, but
Lancaster and York will
supplement it in the mid-
dle. Before too long,
barns have been replaced
by bagel-ries, fields rest
under parking lots, and a
unique locale has lost its
cultural identity.

In another 10 years,
Lancaster might look
much like Monroeville,
which will bear remark-
able resemblance to Erie, which, for
the record, could easily be mistaken
for Bethlehem. _Roads‘ .become
streets become’ strip malls that are
by definition painfully uniform and

uninteresting. .
Those who oppose urban
sprawl, such as the Lancaster

Farmland Trust (www.savelancast-
erfarms.org) do so while citing
practical concerns.

Southeastern Pennsylvania has
some of the most fertile soil in the
world, and it remains one of the
most productive agricultural
regions this side of the Mississip’.
There is money to be made in pro-
duce, and so it’s an argument that
gets listened to from time to" time.
But there is also money to be made
in development, and so much of
Lancaster’s fertile soil 'is set aside
for cul-de-sacs and well-manicured
lawns.

Since money is the driving fac-
tor. behind everything in the world,
including my fair county, the
Lancaster higher-ups must find

 

Eric Miller

Columnist

themselves in a perplexing situa-
tion. ,

While farming does
make some money, the
real cash crop is tourism,
which demands an
uneasy balance between
farms and more devel-
oped attractions.

The Amish run their
farms and live their sim-
ple lives, minding their
own business always,
existing in relative isola-
tion except, that is, for
the river of mini-vans,
khaki shorts and fanny packs that
flows constantly through their com-
munities. . P

This high concentration of
fanny packs — coupled with the tax
hikes and land loss that accompany
strip malls — ends up scaring ‘the
Amish away, and they take the
tourism with them.

The gradual but definite migra-
tion of the Amish west to Ohio and
south to Maryland is fairly well-
documented but still taken for
granted by those who will feel it
most;

When the Amish are gone --
finally replaced by tourists-turned-
residents and the chainstores at
which they shop —— a green and
fiercely local heritage will be dilut-
ed and assimilated. Silos will fall to
bulldozers, roads will run every-
where, and every open space will be
closed by cookie-cutter plastic
houses. Pennsylvania Dutch culture
will exist only in the crappy memo-
rabilia lining select restaurant
walls. It’s happening already.

Finals got you down?
Take a study break in cyberspace!

www.pittnews.com
All the cool kidsare doing it.

The Amish and Lancaster

County have long maintained a sort -

of symbiotic relationship; some-
thing like tax breaks in exchange
for brochure shots. And as long as
the fields were available and the
roads were relatively un-congested,
things looked like they might work
out.

But this is no longer the case. If
those of us on the inside don’t find
some way to fight the ‘progress,’
Lancaster County the idea will
finally drop into mediocrity along
with Lancaster County the reality.

The traffic will be thick, the
scenery bland, the businesses fran-
chised and the Amish completely
absent, .

.But the bright side is that there
will be plenty of chain bookstores
with cheap coffee, and I’m sure
there will be clerks who know

‘where to find. good books on the

subject. _

When Lancaster, ‘Harrisburg and
Philadelphia eventually become
Philaharrister featuring the estates
at West Chester, who knows what
kind of associations this area will
draw for you. I
. My concern is not that they’ll be
negative, but that they’ll be entirely
uniform.

A decade ago, Lancaster County
was something; a decade from now,
I really can’t say.

250 years is a long time - but oie

(.

” “When 18th century settlers first
looked down on the forks of the Ohio
River from Mt. Washington, they saw
a giant arrow pointing west,” said
Laura Fisher, director of French and
Indian War 250 Inc. “Whoever con-
trolled the forks of the Ohio‘ con-
trolled trade on the frontier.”

Now it is simply known as “the
Point,” and people go there to picnic,
exercise and relax.—But 250 years’ ago,
the point where the Monongahela and
Allegheny rivers join was the center
of a war that shaped the development
of a country as well as a city.

The French and Indian War is
often a blurred memory from high

- school taken from a few paragraphs in

a history book just before the

Revolutionary War. French and Indian 1

War 250 Inc. hopes to change that by
commemorating the war in its entire-
ty. They plan to hold events at impor-
tant sites in 20 states throughout the
Northeast and Midwest spanning the
next six years.

“This is really-a story about all of
us and how we came to be a nation,”
said Fisher. “Scholars believe the
French and Indian War set the condi-

I

tions for the Revolutionary
War.”
The festivities kick off in
Pittsburgh on April 17 and run
through the nextday at the
Point ~—-— the much-sought-
after and strategic location that
sparked the colonial war
between the British and
French. There will be reenac-
tor encampments,/18th century
military demonstrations and
period crafts and Wares to
entertain and educate.

The Fort Pitt Museum will
be opening its new exhibit on
18th century history titled
“Keystonegof the Frontier.”

Pittsburgh and southwestern eral forts built at the Point by French

Pennsylvania. This document has

Valley.

‘ “Fort Pitt was the greatest of sev-

and British forces to dominate the
rivers that were the transportation
superhighway of the‘ time; and the
gateway to the west,” said Chuck
Smith, site administrator of Fort Pitt
Museum.

The Other Side

Godsmack _
Universal/Republic Records
79:‘/34'

There comes a time in every band’s
career when they feel they need to “mix
things up a little.” Some bands opt to put
out a greatest hits compilation, while
others release a live album. Godsmack is
no different when it comes to changing
the pace of their music. They’ve recent-
ly released The Other Side — a seven-
song acoustic album that’s a large depar-
ture from their normal hard rock sound.

Three of The Other Side is seven
songs have been previously released on
earlier Godsmack albums -— “Re-align”
from ‘ the 2003 release, Faceless,
“Spiral” from their sophomore album,
Awake — and another has been “repack-
aged.” “Keep Away” from their multi-

platinum self-titled debut LP. “Asleep” — v

originally the title track of their second
album, Awake, has had a slight face-lift
and is now ‘presented in a “nicer” for-

same with guitarist Tony Rombola play-
ing unplugged.

“Asleep,” previously named
“Awake” and released from the album of

the same name, has received a facelift.

Besides having been slowed down,
some lyrics from the track have been
slightly altered. The line, “Wait another
minute / Can’t you see what this pain
has f———-ing done' to me?” has been

changed to “Wait a minute / Can’t you A

see what this pain has done to me?”
Subtle changes like this make “Asleep”
lack the anger the original possessed.

One of the new songs, “Touche,”
showcases the vocal prowess of lead-
singer Sully Ema as he wails “And I
only would do for you what you do for
me, yeah.” However, one can’t help but
wonder what the song would sound like
if it were a full-ﬂedged rock version.

Fear Factory broke ground, as well as a few eardrums,
in the music industry and they continue as they started

Fear Factory, page 14

remixed songs from their debut album called
Fear Is the Mind Killer. With thatrelease, the
band showed an openness to expanding its music
into different sounds and different scopes by let-
ting Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb of Front Line
Assembly mix some of its songs to create
wholly new, inventive sounds.

Fear Factory was one of the pioneers of
this concept, long before bands like Linkin
Park —— with its remix attempt Reanimation
--— even tried to achieve it.

The band paved the way for heavy metal
artists to express their music in different
ways that expand their sound. Fear Factory
did the same with their next full~length
release, Demanufacture, by releasing a
remix project, Remanufacture.

When Obsolete was released in 1999, it
proved to be Fear Factory’s most popular
album to date. It was the first to crack the
Billboard Top 100 and led to the band’s par-,
ticipation in projects like the annual celebra-
tion of metal and black clothing, lovingly
known as Ozzfest. The success continued
when Digimortal was released two years
later and snaked into the top 40.

Now with the release of Archetype, and
the rave reviews preceding it, Fear Factory
is confident about its sound.

The 6-foot-3 freshman from

said, “‘cause have a big heart, so
I’m going to go out and compete
every night.”

And she did just that, despite
the disappointing outcome in the
win-loss column. last season.

“It was a heart-breaking season
for me, personally, ‘cause I expect-

to be able to use — lucky.

Before I satwback and wrote this

sports writers’ final columns.
Almost every one talked about their
experiences at Pitt sporting events
and how much fun they had covering
these events. I can say the same, but
none of these people, at least in the
past 20 years, were able to do as
much as I did.

I have covered four bowl games
and three NCAA tournaments, not to
mention a clean sweep — four for
four Big East Championship games.
This is insane. I’m 21 years old and
I’ve gottefi to cover three NCAA

time wishing they could go to three
NCAA tournaments as a fan,‘ and I
got to do it all with a press pass.

Hiser returns from injury to help lift Panthers’ offense

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

You can’t conﬁne a wild beast for long, especially
when his name is R]. Hiser.

Hiser, one of the starting pitchers on the Panthers’
baseball team, was a caged beast last year. He had fall-
en victim to a hand injury that he suffered in an off-the-
ﬁeld incident, which left two of his knuckles on his right
hand broken and placed him on the injured list for most
of the 2003 season.

But now, he’s back, and no one could be happier
than Hiser.

“It’s tough to sit here and watch the guys play when
you know you want to be out there,” Hiser said.

His coach described it as “almost like caging a wild
animal,” head coach Joe Jordano said. ’

Hiser did not let his time on the bench go to waste.
He is too emotional a player to just sit around and watch
what is going on around him. Rather, he did what many
pros do when they are not able to take the ﬁeld —
learned how to betterhis play.

“He saw the game from a different perspective,”
Jordano said. \

And what did Hiser learn?

“Well, I learned to not goof around as much, for
one,” he said, cracking a smile. “I learned a thing or two
about hitting.” -

Don’t believe him — he learned a little more than a
thing or two. He now leads the Panthers, and the Big
East, in two offensive categories, with 11 home runs and

I ' a .862 slugging percentage. He is also batting .379 and

has knocked in 32 runs this season —— both statistics
ranked third in the Big East.

-

And-his pitching statistics are just as good. He owns
an earned-run average of 3.63 and he is off to a 3-0 start
this season. Add that to his 31 strikeouts in 39 and one-
third innings pitched and you can see why he is easily
the Panthers’ most valuable player.

“He’s doing it all for us,” Jordano said. “He’s a hell
of a competitor.” A

Jordano does everything he ‘can to get Hiser in the
lineup every day. If he is not starting on the mound, he’ll
play in the outﬁeld or even hit as the designated hitter.

“I like the outﬁeld,” Hiser admits, adding, “[but] I’ll
do whatever it takes for us to win.”

This is not the first time Hiser has put up awe-
inspiring numbers. In 2002, the year before‘ he went
down with his hand injury, he was an All-Big East selec-
tion, with his 10.5 strikeouts per game, totaling 87 at

. season’s end.'His strikeout average was ranked 23rd in

the nation. On the offensive side, he hit .280 with ﬁve
home runs and 19 runs scored.
The 22-year old right-hander plans on moving on to

the majors. He’s already been drafted once —— a year.

prior to his arrival at Pit

The San Francisco Giants drafted him in the 42nd
round of the 2001 Major League draft after his two years-

at Hagerstown Community College in Maryland, but

once he signed with Pitt, his contract with the Giants 1

became null and void.

This next time around, he hopes"that his hometown ’

favorite, the Baltimore Orioles, hand him a jersey and
announce his name on selection day. . ..
And if that were to happen, he’d not only be play-
ing for the team he grew up cheering for, he’d be play-
ing in the stadium his idol owned for 10 seasons.
“Cal Ripken Jr.,” Hiser said. “He always came to

play.” .. .
And Hiser was there when Ripken said goodbye to
the baseball" world. Among the 48,807 fans .in atten-
dance at Camden Yards on Oct. 6, 2001, behind all the
ﬂash bulbs and the signs that read, “We consider our-

selves the luckiest fans on earth,” was Hiser and his \

father, Pete, who have owned season tickets to the
Orioles for over 12 years.

“It was an exciting game,” his father said, despite
the fact the Red Sox handed the Orioles their 98th loss
of the season. .

Following the game, a podium was set up between
third base and shortstop —- the two positions Ripken

‘played. There, Ripken gave his farewell speech.

Soon after that, Hiser would likewise say farewell
—— to his hometown of Hagerstown, and head off to Pitt.

“I really liked the campus, liked the coaches and
liked the program,” Hiser said about Pitt. “[Plus] my dad
is only three hours away. I wanted him to be able to
watch me play.” ,

Like -Ripken, who played .in 2,632 consecutive
games, Hiser’s father doesn’t miss toomany games. He
made the trip to West Virginia when the Panthers won

two games in a doubleheader on Saturday. He witnessed .
_his son strike out seven Mountaineers in Pitt’s 7-2 vic-

tory in Morgantown. ..

Hiser hopes that his father will get to see some extra 1

games this _season, as well. He is excited about this
year’s team and its 7-3 record in the Big East. _
“We’ve got a good chance to go to the Big East

[Championship],” Hiser said. “It’s exciting, like being a j

little kid again.”

is ready to run wild.

Expectations can make or break a successful season

Did you ever actually stop and
think about how much media and fan
expectations affect a team?

Look at a team like the Pittsburgh
Pirates, for. example." Expectations for
the club are at an all—time low. If the
team even sniffs .500, fans will be
ecstatic. If they make even the slight-
est/run at a division title, the city
would throw them aparade and man-
ager Lloyd McClendon would
become a local celebrity.

But with-the Pirates, expectations
have been so low for so long that
there is rarely any excitement in the
clubhouse. With 11 consecutive,

‘painful losing seasons and'counting,
the players have grown accustomed
to losing. And even when something

good does happen, players still seem ”

uptight and sound far from opti-
mistic.

The New York Yankees represent
the other side‘ of this equation.‘Can
you imagine what would happen if
the Yankees went‘ .500 this season?

Or if they lost in the first round of the ‘

playoffs‘? The team would be disman-
tled faster than the Pirates’ bullpen
could blow a late-inning lead.

Expectations set thetone in com-

.petitive athletics. They dictate what
constitutes great -plays, good wins,
and satisfactory seasons. The entire
atmosphere at any ballgame revolves
around the expectations surrounding
the team. ' . , V

So what happens when a team
comes out and announces the highest
of expectations for itself?

Last August, Walt Harriswalked
into his first press conference at
media day and stated that the football
team’s goal was to win every, game,
and win a national championship.

Naturally, after the team lost at
Toledo, then got completely embar-
rassed by Julius Jones and the
Fighting Irish at Heinz ‘Field, fans

andmedia expressed disappointment. ~

And why not? After all, if the team’s
own goaliwas to win every game, I’d
say losing to two mediocre opponents
would give fans every right to gripe.

Nothing could be worse than set-
ting the bar too high. Harris was
probably just feeling‘ confident about
the team’s returning talent, and want-
ed to generate some more excitement

p around the team after the whole Big
East Conference fiasco.

The team would hav_e\ had high
expectations coming intothis season
regardless of Harris’ pledge. But if he
had simply said thatthe team’s goal
was to win a Big East title, he would
have had something to fall back on
when the team began the year at 3-2
heading into conference play.

The other side of the coin here on

’ the Pitt campus is the men’s basket-

ball team who, after losing coach Ben
Howland and point guard Brandin
Knight, was picked to finish fourth in
the Big East.

Sure, everyone was hoping the

   

A L U M N I
ASSOCIATION

   

Panthers would advance past the
Sweet 16 at -the end of this season.
But let’s be honest, outside of Jamie
Dixon and the players themselves,
not many predicted the kind of suc-
cess the team experienced this ‘year.

The result of the early success
was an electric atmosphere filled
with fans who were pumped about a
team that went out and overachieved.

Whether it.is the fans and media
setting the expectations on the team,
or the team setting high standards for
itself, those expectations are what
determine a team’s attitude and iden-
tity.

Let’s face i_t; no matter how much

Without the fans, the games couldn’t
be played. And when fans aren’t
happy, they make their voices heard.
And once those voices get loud
enough, they can almost always bring
about change.

My senior class is only the
fourth‘ class — and first since the
class of 1980 — to see Pitt football
go to four bowls in four years. I have
written some negative remarks about
the football team over the past four-
years, and rightfully so, but let’s put
things in perspective; only two years
before I got to Pitt, the Panthers gave
up 77 points to Ohio State. Now if
Pitt doesn’t go to at least the Gator
Bowl, it’s a bad season. That’s'.

’ remarkable. A

I will never’ forget being able to
go to Notre Dame Stadium and touch
the “Play Like a_ Champion Today”
sign and walk through the tunnel
onto the field chanting, “Rudy,
Rudy”. I remember standing on the

sidelines in Morgantown, W.Va., and

watching Antonio Bryant catch a
touchdown seconds after losing his
shoe, and I will never forget being so

‘ close to the field at the Insight Bowl

in 2002 that I could almost touch
Larry Fitzgerald as he caught the
touchdown that made him famous.
As for men’s basketball, this sea-
son was only the 16th time Pitt has
ever .been in the NCAA Tournament.
I already have stated what this squad -
didiin my four years at Pitt, so I
won’t' get into that again,‘ but just
realize something — before the 2002
NCAA Tournament, Pitt hadn’t been
to the “big dance” since the 1993
season, and the Panthers hadn’t won
two games in‘ the tournament since
1974. . A
I got to cover the Pitt team with
the most wins in school history,
which I will never forget. I saw
Julius Page dunk over Ruben
Bouintje-Boumtje. I witnessed three
of the best games ever in three con-
secutive Big East Championship
games against Connecticut, and I
saw the game that put Pitt back on
the college basketball map — beat-

p ing Georgetown on a last second tip-~

loved covering all the other sports.

What can you say about the
men’s swimming and diving team? It
has been the most consistent Pitt

sport in‘ the past ‘decade. Until-

you’ve gone and watched a meet at
Trees Pool, you can’t truly appreci-
ate how dominant a squad in the Big
East it truly is. The Panthers are
even more dominant then Miami
football ever was.

was absolutely amazing. I’m not kid-
ding when I tell you my favorite Pitt
home game was this year when the
volleyball team beat Notre Dame in
the Fitzgerald Fie1d_House to take
home the Big East Regular Season
Championship. I’ve never been more
pumped than I was at that volleyball
match, _ . _

Then there is baseball, softball,
soccer, track and tennis. These
sports just don’t get their fair due.

For soccer and tennis, it is absurd «

that you have todrive 45 minutes to

watch these athletes perform. When

Steve Pederson, Pitt’s former athlet-
ics director,‘ tore down Pitt Stadium,
he wrecked /these sports. Pitt was
promised a soccer field every year I
was here. Where are the fields now?
I hope our new athletics director,
Jeff Long, gives these sports what
they deserve — a ‘court, field or
track where they can officially play

pus.

Brown said. “But here in college,

I also want to thank some people
who you may or may not know. First,
writing doesn’t come naturally for
me. I’ve learned how to write over
the years, but no one has been more

influential on my writing ‘then Joe

Bendel. Without his guidance, I
wouldn’t have been able to write
some of the stories I have since the
fall of 2000.

I could never have known every-
thing about Pitt sports ifit wasn’t for
Sports Information Director E.J.
Borghetti. While he could have been
my biggest critic, he supported me

from day one, and let me cover Pitt
sports the way I wanted to.

I also want to thank all the play-
ers who have befriended me over the
years. I’m not talking as a business
relationship, but the friends I have
made throughout this ordeal have
been amazing. People, like Julius
Page, Mark McCarroll, Lousaka
Polite, Penny Semaia, Laine Selwyn,
Sheila Stufﬂet, Carl Krauser and
especially.Chris Curd.

Lastly, I have to thank Al
Gottman for introducing me to more
people then my miniscule brain can
remember, and for [giving me hope
that when I’m 90 years old, I can

still have the love and passion for
sports that I do now.

This. four-year run has been
amazing. But as of today I am
announcing that the Israeli Rebel is
retiring from The Pitt News. I guess
this means I will be eligible for The
Pitt News Hall of Fame in 2009. I
look forward to seeing everyone at
my induction ceremony then.
