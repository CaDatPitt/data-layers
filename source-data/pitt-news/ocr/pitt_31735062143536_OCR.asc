Y Sponsors Address

In the first general student assem-.

bly since.-.lau.uar_v 13 when Sherwood
Eddy addressed University students.
Dr, Henry Van Dusen, dean of stu-
dents at Union Theological Seminary,
will at 12:30 o'clock today speak at a
YMCA-spoiisored assembly in Memo-
rial Hall on “.V'ent.ures in Belief for a
Skeptical Generation.”

A graduate of Z?rincetou University,
and possessor of degrees from Edin-
boro University and from Union Theo-
logical Seminary, Dean Van Dusen
has constantly maintained contact
with Iln.iv<-arsity students, their aims,
aspimtioris. and handicaps, He ex-
plitllls that his mission is to develoli
a working philosophy of life, a prac-
t.ical one for lifting students out of
their mental ruts. He will attempt to
outline ,pres(—-ut day obstacles and
their effect upon mental -conditions of
college students.

One of the spectiacular aspects of
the addresses of the young lecturer is
the fact that he uev_er prepares :1
memorized lecture, but always deliv-
ers his talks in impromptu fashion.

Dr. Van Dusen has been persuaded
by Mr. TV. TV. Mend-enhall, executive
secret.a.r,v of the Yl\-ICA, to stop off at
Pittsburgli for today's assembly on
his way to the Bethany College re-
ligious forum this week. Today's pro-
_$Il"8.ll‘i follows a policy adhered to an-
nually by the YM and YMCA’s to con-
duct at least one religious forum each
year with some prominent theologian
as guest speaker,

Silence Week Ends As Bids
Are Sent Women Rushees

Pledging Ceremonies Will be Performed Monday;
Present System Aid to Rushees, Fraternities

 

Rusliccs and fraternity women are anxiously awaiting the end
of SllCIlC0 week tomorrow at noon.

between women on campus have
trahied. Fol.lo\viug' the decree of

Silence week occurs semi-annually, immediately after cach rush-

mcn being rushed. It was established
so that after the hectic rushing sea-
son they mi;:;ht have time to think
things out, and decide, without any
outside interference, which group
they wish to join.

Although fra.te1'nity women
cepted their bid, rushees will not
know until tomorrow when they re-
ceive their formal invitation to join.
which group has accepted them, their
first, second, or third choice.

Both fraternities and pledges are
saved embarrassment by the closed
ballot system. As a result of this syr-
tem the former do not know whether
their pledges accepted them as first
or last choice, and the latter do not
‘know whether or not they were bid
by another fraternity.

Pledge ribbons must be pinned on
ueophytes before 8:30 o’clock Monday
morning, and formal pledging will
take place Monday night.

Accordiiig to the new plan. which

committee for the University award,
petitions for nomination will be ob-
t.a.ina.ble at the office of the Dean of
Men at an announced time and must
be returned within a. certain time
limit to be announced later. The re-
turned petitions must contain the sig-

tion; an accurate and complete rec-
ord ot‘ his grades for the Preceding

indicating the reasons why the can-

Another feature of the new consti-
tution is the revised election code.
‘By this" revision, use is made of the

secret ballot and the preferential
method of voting, two features which
were conspicuously absent in the dis-

Plans for the Stewart Laboratory.
an addition to Thaw Hall, which will
include a. central heating plant for
all campus buildings, are being
pushed by the Engineering Alumni As-
sociation in co—operation with univer-
si.t;.' officials. A. \VeIdin and D. J.
Richards, directing the association,
announced further plans for the build-
ing yesterday.

The new laboratory, to be erected
on the site of the imiversity book-
store, near Thaw Hall, will house all
equipiuent too bulky to be taken into
'tlie.('.‘.-athedral. Through the intro-
duction of new macliinery, it is hoped
that heat. may be more cfﬁciently and
economically supplied to all campus
buildings from one central plant.

The erection of the lalioratory, Mr.
Richards said on behalf of the alumni
group, will provide Pitt engtineers with

of the fraternity going local followed,
but no deﬁnite action was taken. The
entire matter‘ was referred back to
the committee, which, besides Green.
includes VVilliam H. Lewis and George

tion. It is believed that some deﬁnite
s_€eps will be taken towarrl localiza-

Pitt Coeds Choose
Gammoifs, Hilaud

 

Popular Restaurants Are
Dancers’ Meccas

A survey of the Pitt campus con-

ducted through the last week has un-
covered the fact that half the girls
who are accepting bids to the Fresh-
man Dance tonight, besides the fun
they know they're going to get out of
the affair itself, are actually keeping
in front of them the thought that if
they go to the dance they'll certainly
land up at the Hiland House or at
Gammon’s in Oakland.
“Laugh if you want to,” confessed
one fair co-ed, “but if my h. f. doesn't
ﬁnish up the evening at the I-Iilancl
house or at one of the other Gammon
restaurants, he'll be all washed up as
far as I'm concerned.” And it's a
funny thing. They all feel the same
way!

It seems that half the big-time of
a dance night is the aftermath at a
Gammon foodery. The fellows inevi-
tably steer the sweet things thence,
and the girls themselves grab hold of
any unknowing freshman with the
stern warnings to “go to Gammorrs,
or e1se—--—-!_” The upperclassmen, of
course, need no such guidance.

Naturally, most of the campus shots
and shotesses are preparing for to-
night's dansant; the rest, who per~
halls can't spare the shekels, plan
to join the gang at Gammon’s and let
their heart disturbances get a load
of what the dancers are wearing.
Because it's a sure thing that the
Gammon prices are just the sort that
those same tottering pocketbooks can
easily stand.

Up to now, the great emigration
from every dance has been in the di-
rection of the Hiland house out in
East Liberty, where Pitt reigns su-

preme. But Gammons, by remodeling
their Oakland restaurant in a. big
way, have also made it possible 1‘...-'
the fellow with his heart in the right
place, but wi_th no machine to get to
the Hiland house, to give his ﬂame
the same Pitt atmosphere within walk-
ing distance of the affair. Now he
can drag his pash. to the Oakland.

Engineering Association to
Dance_ March 10

cu—;u———-ua.—_—

 

Beginning today an intensive cam-
paign will be launched by President
E. H, R. Pegg, '33, and the "eleven rep-
resentatives on his cabinet‘ for mem-
bers to the Engineering Association
among undergraduates in the six dc-
partments of the Engineering School,

Vvith the Junior Prom entirely out
of the way and with the majority of
the work on the selling of ticketslfor
tonight's Freshman Dance completed,
Pegg looks for a noticeable increase;
in the sale of membership tickets.
’.l‘hese tickets, selling for one dollar
include admittance to the semester
dance of the Association scheduled
for next Friday night in the spacious
ballroom of the Grotto Club on the
North Side and to the general engi-
neering smoker which will take place
early in May.

Billy Weixel’s ten-piece orchestra
has ueﬁnitely been chosen by the
Cabinet to play for next Friday's af-
fair. This band scored with patrons
of the College Association formal

‘dance in November and was also im-

mensely popular at the Physical Edu-
cation formal in January.

More than 400 engineering students
joined the Association last semester
with a large percentage of that num-
ber present at the dance at the Schen-
ley Hotel, All attended the smoker
the following month.

Pegg is conﬁdent that the 400 mark
will again be reached next week, de-
claring that the bargain aspect of As-
sociation membership inevitably im-
presses the thrifty engineers.

A recent meeting of the cabinet of
the Association, composed of two
delegates from each of the six depart-
ments in the School, was marked by
the election of a vice president and :1
sec1‘eta1‘y, both held by junior repre-,
sentatives. Both offices went to thei
only two members of the cabinet.
Harold E. Mahony, '34, of the chem-
ical department was made vice presi-
dent, and Philip M. Smith, ’34, from
the mechanical department was elect-
ed secretary."

Tickets for next week's dance may

be purchased from Miss Page in the
olﬁc-.e of Dean Holbrook, and from the

following cabinet members: Pegg; H.‘

Carl B. Kass. director of Pitt P1a.V'-

week for his third major production
of‘ the year, is now workillg at the
diflicult job of casting, He has se-
lected asthe April 6 show, “Minick,”

by George S. Kaufman and Edna
Fer-ber taken front Edna Ferber’s
short story, “Old Man Minick.”

“Mlnick" is one of the most appeal-
ing character come-idles that has been
seen on Broadway in many years. It
tells the story of an old man, who
coming to live with his son and

-daughter-in,-law, who are used to late

parties, like social reforms, and in
general are quite modern, whereas he
is a remnant. of an older order and

can not get used to the new ways.

Minick is both comic and pathetic in
this strained position and is not able
to help himself to better it until he
ﬁnally-has to admit that he really is
an old man and from that time on his
course of action is settled.

There are three old men's parts in
the show which have been assigned
to John Neary, Ed. '33, C, Howard
Smith, Ed. ’35, a.nd‘Louis Reizenstein,
Col. ’35. One of these old men's parts

is Minick, but theﬁnal choice of the”

person to play it has yet to be made.
l\~Iinick’s“ son,‘ Fred, "who has entered
secretly into the mail-order business,
thus affording Minick a, good chance

take his father's part whether he is
right or wrong. is played b3’ 01181.18)’

Two of Fred's business associates-

and party-pals, Jim Corey, a very
breezy person, and Al Diamond, a still
more breezy person, will be Vvinston
McConkey, Col. '35, and Morton Har-
ris. Bus. Ad, '36. Al's wife, played by
Barbalra Mateer, Col, '34, an ardent
club woman and teadrinker, 'is,%.>..1most

Mrs.I.-ippineott, Rose Ball, Col. '34.
Lula, anegro maid, willbe played by

League Lead I   
Depends On
Temple Game

Qyyls Show Big Imprcvement
In Playing Form Since
Early "Pitt Qame

--—————,-——u_.—

9°59? Rose" High Scerer

 

The championship of the ‘Eastern
Intercollegiate Basketball League
hinges on the result of the Pitt-T‘e'ni-
pile gamein Philadelphia tomorrow
night. Pitt has won four and ‘lost
one, to Georgetown, in league games
this year, while Temple has won five
and lost two, to Pitt and ' Cariiegiel
Tech, ~

The Owls have shown a. vast im-
provement in their playing form since
they were here early in the season
and with Pitt weakened through the
loss of the services of Cribbs and
'Wainio, stand to reverse the tables.
Temple will be paced by the brilliant
Ptosey Rosen, leading scorer of the
Eastern League.

Liebensberger and it‘riedDerg have
developed into stars for the Owls.
The six-foot ﬁve-inch Liebensbergcr
has replaced Len Gudd, husky football
tackle. at the regular center post and
has added to the general teamplay of ’
Temple. ‘ ‘

‘ The starting lineup for Pitt will be
Skippy Hughes and Captain Don
Sniitlfat the forwards. Russ Ochsen-*
hirt back at his old post of last year

at center. and l)on McCan1ant and’

Charley Hughes ﬁlling the guard
posts.’ Pitt will present a strong
starting lineup, but will be .weakened.
considerably in case replacements
are required. Donny Beck and Char,-
ley Bogda will be used as substitutes
at foijwaijds, ‘Bill Bond at center, and
Cutriand Kuno at the guards. '

Should Pitt lose tomorrow nlght’s
game, Temple will gain undisputed
possession of first‘ place though
Coach Carlson's team may again tie
thecount by defeating Tech later in
the season. But close followers of
the team’ are not looking for a” defeat
tomorrow night. Pitt showed great
’forrn'last week, according to eastern
experts, when they downed the Navy,
and by now the new starting combina-
tion should be well integrated. '

Win Eight Meets; Schedule
' ' Three More

 

After emerging victorious in all
eight of their meets up-to-date,
the freshman swimming team, coach-
ed. by Pat Corr and George Lee, and

,managed by Roy McClaytoii, Bus. Ad.

'35, expects to ﬁnish the season un-
defeated.

‘The team's meeting with South

I-Iills, at the high school's pool yes-

terday, leaves only three more con-

tests, only one of which, a tentative

one with Kiski, planned for Tuesday
is expected to offer the Pitt mermen
muoli competition. The other two
meets before the close of the season
are against Schenley on the ninth of
this month, and with Peabody on the
sixteenth. “

Met and defeated by the Frosh
swimmers were Allegheny, 49-15;
Schenley, 46-18; Carrick, 44-20; West-
inghouse, 52-12; South Hills, 57.-13;
Carrick, 37-27‘; Turtle Creek, 38-17;
and Clairton, 43-12. With Pitt hold-
ing a margin of only ten points, the
second match with Garrick was the
tightest of the season.

The freshman team this year has a
number of outstanding stars. Lind-
-berg is considered the most versatile
swimmer on either the freshman on
varsity“tea-m~,’ excelling in both the
long and short events. Chambers in
the sprints and ‘relay is one of the
high scorers, and Madden has devel-
oped into 'a'sp'ee'd_.y sprinter. ' ‘Landau
has been hold'ing'u_p the -breaststroke
end of the competition. Herecently
swam 100,_ya_r_ds inﬂ1:12 ' '

Wahlberg, Wells, Mosena, Nadler,
Rube, Rubenstein and Nelson, the’ re-
maining meiirbers of the ‘team, have
contributed greatly to the ‘success of
the team. Rurie has shown much im-
provenient since the start of the sea-
son ‘and has beenlable to decrease his
time for the 10{0-yard free ‘style, from
1:13 to under a minute. "

Eros Or Erix?

STUDENT COUNCIL again was

regalcd to a second place position

as the student executive chamber, with its legislative and judicial
powers passed lightly over, at its meeting W'cdnesday night. This
time it was WSGA who failed either to clearly understand or to ap-

preciate the authority vested by

students in their chosen council-

manic organization, to place Council in the position of being a body

that, at will, can be subordinated.

We believe the attitude taken by \VSGA was unfair in main-
taining the belief that the women committed no wrong in not asking
the advice of Council, not seeking its cooperation in the matter of
the Senior Week keys; and the opinion expressed by its sister or-
ganization, Pan Hellenic, that the grounds of objection by Council

on the matter was purely in the
unjust.

manner of the pouting child, was

In this matter, we believe, these organizations which represent
the women, only, on the campus, acted without further reason than
the one that was openly expressed--that fact that any such action
would immediately place them in the position of being governed, and

remove them from the sphere of

being the governors. They could

not see, or they failed to see, that the very action which they rebelled
against, was one which would tend to interlock the two groups, to
weld them into a. universal student governing organization working
in harmony with all students rather than have two conﬂicting and
competitive parts—~the men and the women-—which must beat the
other to the post to gain any authority which it desires.

The opinion expressed by President Reed Rose, in that Council
was not seeking authority over VVSGA, Pan Hellenic, or any other
organization on the campus, but was a steering committee of those

organizations, with the welfare of

the campus vested in its organiza-

tion, is the point that has been sadly submerged in petty bickerings
which projected themselves into past meetings to minimize the good
which Council can do, and which it should do to create a more
friendly student association and a more closely knit. student organi-

zation.

Problems which now face Student Council, the Student Union
project, proportional school representation in the makeup of the gov-
erning group, and the strengthening of relations between the student
organizations and the administration need the cooperation of all
component parts which go to make up the student society of this

campus.

vance of dance than they have hereto
been selected.

Suggestion of lower rate for the
halls now used by the students for

their major dances brought a. report
from the Student Union Committee
concerning the use of the sixth floor
of the Cathedral of Learning for Uni-
'\‘Gl‘Sil.'_V dances. This project, proposed
sometime ago by council members,
and taken to Mr. ‘Weber. business
manager of the University, was con-
sidered inadvisable by the University
administration in that the ﬁoor pro-
posed by council to be used as a. dance
ﬂoor for the All-University dances had
already been given over to the class-
room use of the Civil Engineering de-
partment.

Since the movement of desks used
by the department would soon render
the floor unﬁt for dance purposes, it
was suggested by Mr. Weber that
council look over the Trees Gym with
a view that this ﬂoor take the place
of the Cathedral ﬂoor for the use of
students for their dances. After much
discussion» concerning the merits
of the substitute plan the matter was
taken under advisement by council.

It was pointed out by Arthur Gold-
berg, Col, ’33, “when you go to one
dance you go to all of them. There
seems to be no distinction between the
larger University dances on this
.-campus, other than the name." It
was pointed out that a nationally
known orchestra has been obtained,
that favors would be given, which
seems to _earma.rk all major dances,
other than the name of the organiza-
tion behind the project.

It was the consensus of opinion by
members of council that steps be
taken to lower the costs of the or-

chestra. either through judicious con-
tracting with out-of-town orchestras,
or supplanting national orchestras
with local orchestras of proven worth,
in order to transfer some of the cost
to decorating of the ﬂoors, and the
planning of novelties to change the
steretoyped form which dances of re-
cent years liave taken.

Rebok Pegg, Eng. ’33, president of
the Engineering Association, called
upon to recount committee methods for
engineering dances, believed that
committees for major dances have
been too large and unwieldly. It was
pointed out that on all engineering
dances, the cabinet made of 12 stu-
tdents representing all departments of
rthe Engineering -School did the work
of selling tickets and making all ar-
rangements for engineering dances,
which is much smaller than the usual
number of students other dance com-
mittee, estimated range from 20 to
50 students,

After further discussion it was de-
cided to project the problem of the
dance success into the next business
meeting of council,

1 At the invitation of council, Rose

Marie Demastichasl, Ed. ’33, president
05 WSGA. appeared to answer the
charges made by council at its last
meeting concerning the seeming in-
fraction of council's authority to au-
thorize the sale of Senior Week Keys.

Since keys were sold only to wo-
men, the opinion was held that wo-
men had not exceeded their power in
Placing keys on sale, and felt’ that
U_16_Y had 1In:i11st1Y been accused in pro-
viding for the Senior Week key sale.
It was decided after a lenghty discus-
S10l1. that the sale of Senior Week
keys be withheld until the senior
week chairman had been chosen, and
to_ await his approval or disagreement,
with council remaining non-commjtal
on the subject.

The chairman of Senior Week will
be chosen at a. meeting of council

within the next two weeks.

Ennkstall
(balling

By Don Early

Most people who like Sinclair
Lewis will like this book. In it, Lewis
Writes of the things that worried him
most in Babbit, and Elmer Gantry
(added, of course, a stronger and
timely dose of socialism) a.nd he does
it in much the same manner. Indeed,
if it is Lewis one wants, he is here,
all right, more thunderously an advo-
cate of sincerity and social justice
than ever. Some, however, will won-
der whe-tlier it isn't just these on-
thusiasms that have tricked him into
doing a. pretty poor piece of work-—
whether Lewis doesn't forget much of
the time that he is writing a novel
and slip into trumpeting propaganda?

At least, here is general ground for.

criticism, and when one goes further,
certain obvious and more particular
faults come out.

Too Much Socialism

In the first place, Lewis’s socialism
is a big bite. With literature, to be
sure, one is not going to quarrel about
political questions as they enter in-
evitably iuto the lives of certain hu-
man beings; politics constitutes a
part of life. But to be confronted
with an ever-present socialistic stir
that bubbles again and again through
chapters that sound like Family Wel-
fare records not only -beiittles our in-
telligence in its attempt to make us
believe that people always think so-
cialism, but it is boring as well.

This "sort of thing, presumably, had
gone with the early twenties. But
Ann Vicl‘(e'r"s calls up strongly H. G.
Wells Utopian novel of pre-war days.
In fact, -Ann herself has a pretty ob-
vious kinsliip with Well's own Ann
Veronica. More than once a. parallel
is suggested——-in the socialistic gath-
erings, when the situation is the col-
logo, and particularly in the woman
suifrage movement that ends in both
books with the heroine. stranded in
jail where she has time “to think it
over.”
are superﬁcial and not at all fair to
Lewis; but they show deﬁnitely the
direction in which he is working.
For Ann Vickers is an uuconcealed
attempt to get across certain social
ideas through a type of woman whom
Lewis would like to inhabit his ideal
society.

ideas submerge Ann

The trouble is, the ideas are more
important than Ann. By far the lar-
ger portion of the book is devoted to
descriptions of prisons (with a not
too exaggemted emphasis on brutal
conditions) to digressions on the
shortcomings of social agencies and
settlements, as well as to those of
present moral conventions. In the.in-
stance of the prison, for example, one
feels that what goes on inside Ann
has less signiﬁcance than what hap-
pens inslde the cells. 7

To be sure, as a character Ann has
a. certain strength and higl1-minded-
ness. One cannot lielp admiring her.
But something is lacking. Sometimes
these very qualities seem almost
tacked onto her, as though they were
not her’s so much as the qualities
Lewis would like her to have but with
which he cannot gracefiilly and legit.-
imately endow her. Ann is not full-
rounded. Certain speeches do not
come natural to her, but have a false,
sometimes borrowed tone. Often she
is sentimental, as in her effusions
about the child.

Sentimentality, however, is more
the quality of Judge Dolphin, however
much Lewis has tried to make him
strong. Obviously, the Judge is a so-
cial sy111bol——tl1e type of those who
administer the law and who, through
some minor offense, come under its
stigma themselves. The situation is
full of irony. But what about the
Judge, does he blame the law, the ju-
dicial system or the prisons and the
criminals? Oh, no. On a. wave of
righteous emotion, he says:

“Tliere is one curious thing~—-going
back to what I was saying about be-
ing such a good judge. Now that I'm
one of them--9. criminal-—and like
them (even the dear little teases that
ride me about having been a. jedge,
and God knows I don't blame ’em for
it). I see what decent follows a. good
share of the convicts are, a.nd I rea-
lize that when I felt most severe and
righteous and gave the stiffest sen-
tences, then I was most vicious, per-
haps, and when I was unetliically sen-
timental and easy, perhaps I was
nearest to dealing out justice.”

Now what is this but sheer emo-
tional slobbering? Phrases like these
appear not only at the climax, but
Lewis must go melodramatic to the

end by having Dolphin unexpectedly_

pardoned and the whole situation
turn rosy and blissfully undisturbed.
This is not the calm won through true
struggle. It is an author’s sentiment-
al concession.

WCEL Hears
Louise Ritchie

“After College, What?” is
Subject of Address

“The lethargy concerning the pres-
ent economic situation can be reme-
died when groups such as this got
‘together and take the initiative,” said
Mrs, Louise Ebersbach Ritchie at a
tea sponsored by WCEL Wednesday
from 3:30 to 5:30 o'clock to a group
of college women, comprised mostly
of seniors.

Her topic, “After College, \Vhat?"
was directed chieﬂy to the uppcrclass
women who expect to graduate soon.
Mrs. Ritchie made a sincere appeal to
the women to consider the present
economic situation, Several instances
she has come across recently in her
welfare work were cited. Personality
was empliasized as an important fac-
tor for adjustnieiit a.fl'.er graduation.

Mrs. Ritchie. received her master of
arts degree in education and psychol-
ogy at the University. She then took
graduate work at the Retail Training
Bureau, After holding a position as
vocational adviser at Wooster College,
she became associated with the Fam-
ily ‘Welfarc organization.

After the address, Miss Isabelle An-

‘derson, assistant to the dean of wom-

Inquiry'_Hears Rabbi Glazer
Explain Stand of Judaism

 

Voicing a plea. for religious tolera-
tion and understanding, for assured
world peace, and for Christian and
Jewish cooperation in solving mod-
ern problems, Rabbi B. B. Glazer of
the Rodef Shalom Congregation cli-
maxed his speech, “What is Juda-
ism?” before the Inquiry Forum, Wed-
nesday afternoon.

In presenting the features of the
Jewish faith, the local rabbi traced
the development. of the religion from
its inception as a tribal belief into
its present “universal" form. “The

salient characteristics of Judaism."'

he stated, “are its ethical monothe-
ism, and its doctrine of human broth-
erhooc.”

Answering the moot question of
how the Jews as a race have surviv-
ed "for three." thousand years, ‘Rabbi-
Glazer declared, “Judaism is always
ﬂuid. It is organic in character and
challenging to every generation. And
something is added to it by every new
group.”

Temperance in all things, the rabbi

stressed, is the basis of Jewisli faith.
“Because we advocate temperance we
seldom produce fervent blue laws or
prohibition supporters. “'0 seek the
‘via. media’ of life.”

The Old Testament. includes some
of man's greatest literary achieve-
ments, according to Rabbi Glazer.
Philosophy, poetry, law, and proph-
etic religion are all included i11 it."

The talk was the first in a series of
three sponsored by the Forum which
will deal with religion. Expositions
of Protestantisin next week, and of
Catholicism the week following. will
conclude the series.

Kecnly aware of the problems of business, large
and small, Bell System commercial men are con-
stantly devising special telephone plans to custom-
ﬁt service to the user’s needs.

For example, a plan

they worked out for a

coal distributor helped him to contact 50% more
dealers. A manufacturer, using a telephone selling
plan, sold 700 dozen pairs of hosiery through

one Long Distance call.

A great meat packer

handles complex sales and distribution problems
eﬂ’iciently with the aid of planned Long Distance

and private wire services.

Systematic telephone plans are helping many
users to build business—-cut costs- handle collec-

tions,-— unify nationwide organizations —- increase
proﬁts. And Bell System men are seeking still
other ways to make the telephone more useful.
