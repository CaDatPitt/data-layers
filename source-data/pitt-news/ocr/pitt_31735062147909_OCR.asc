The Woman’s Vocational Confer-
ence which was held April 19, 20, 21
under the auspices of W. S. G. A. was
well attended both by the students
and -by the general public.

Miss Helen Bennett, manager of the
Chicago Collegiate Bureau of Occu-
pations, was the leader of the confer-
ence. Her addresses were enthusias-

, tically received and many girls were
‘able to have personal conferences
with her. Through her experience in
her work in Chicago she is well ﬁtted
.*to give advice along vocational lines
and her knowledge. of vocations is
broad as well as intensive.

In her opening address, “The Road
to ‘Tomorro-w,” given on Wednesday,

she’ spoke of the ﬁeld of vocations as
divided into three parts, what one
likes to do, what one can do, and the
necessity for earning a living. The
individuals taking up different occu-
pations may ge classed as the ones
who like people, the ones who like
things, the ones who like ideas, or
combinations of these. Different vo-
cations are specially suited to people
who like these various things,

The religious ﬁeld was ‘* ..:::.iled in
a unique and satisfactor rmanner.

1 Those who we: .3 inter  in the
Protestant field of eligious work
were addressed by Miss Jessie White,
the Catholic ﬁeld by a religious work-
er of the Order of Mercy, the Jewish

. ﬁeld by Mrs. Stella S. Lazarus. In
this way each girl could «hear the dis-
cussit." of the ﬁeld in which she was
interested.

Miss Muriel Brown, Assistant Di-
rector, Special Education Bureau, of
Harrisburg, gave a most comprehen-
sive address on “Openings in Psychol-
ogy.” She covered the whole ﬁeld of
places for women in psychology and
prophesied future advancement along
that line. '

Thursday morning was given‘ over
to -the literary’ ﬁeld. Andrew Con-

’ nolly, advertising manager of the J o-
seph Horne Co., spoke on the fasci-
nating possibilities in “Advertising.”

. Mrs. F. Orr Johnson who is herself
a writer of note gave an interesting
and practical talk on “Magazine
Writing.” ‘Miss Ruby Eisamen of
the Pittsburgh Sun spoke on “Book
Reviews” and Miss May Stranathan
of the, Dispatch on “The Special Ar-
ticle Writer.”

In the business ﬁeld Miss Elizabeth

Dyer of» the Carnegie Institute of

. Technology spoke on “Educational
Work in Department Stores.” Miss
Fannie Dunbar gave an instructive
address on “Women in Iusurance.”
«She emphasized the social service
side of the work as insurance helps
people to save for the future.

“CHARGE” T0“-
COMMITTEE
Pepper Prize Committee Held

First Meeting In State Hall
Last Friday.

 

 

The George Wharton Pepper ‘Prize
committee began its work of selecting
the “ideal student” last Friday at a
meeting in State Hall, when a letter
by Chancellor John G. Bowman," con-
taining some of the qualiﬁcations to
he possessed by the honored student,
was read. The comm'ittee.organized
itself, selecting ‘Thomas Thornton,
Law ’23, as chairman, and Isabelle

The deliberations of the committee
are to be secret and when the “ideal
student” is ﬁn-ally selected, his name
will be submitted to Chancellor Bow-
man who will make the public an-
nouncement at the commencement ex-
ercises in June. K

-Chancellor Bowmanis “charge” to

the committee follows:

“In accordance with Senator Pep-
per’s letter, you are the jury chosen
by your respective classmates to se-
lect the student who most closely con-
forms to the type which the Uni-
versity should aim to produce. By
this same letter I am in the position
of a judge to charge you as the jury
to select one of your fellows to this
conspicuous position. '
“Senator Pepper in'his letter sug-
gests one of the important charges
which should guide you in your de-
cision. It is that you have been
chosen without previous commitment
respecting the person to receive the
reward. The implication is that you
shall proceed to this selection’ with-
out regard to personal likes, or dis-
likes, or prejudices; and that you
shall serve as a committee represent-
ing not a class or a school, but the
University as a whole. It is your
obligation to consider the merit of
each student, man or woman, who
may be suggested by -any member of.
this committee, upon his or ‘her merit
without reference whatsoever to the
school or class in which the or she
may be registered.

“As a jury you are ﬁguratively
locked up. Your deliberations are for
No word of any
opinion or view expressed by any
member of this jury at any meeting
is to be ‘repeated outside. Your total
verdict is to be the name of the stp-
dent selected, together with the name

University. The verdict is to be kept
secret until announced at Commence-
ment in June. '

“Senator Pepper did not intend, I
am conﬁdent, that in a narrow sense
there is a single type of student
which the University aims to produce.
The University produces many types
of students, each one of which is
“best” in the eyes of the institution.
There are, however, certain qualifica-
tions all of which are outstanding in
the lives of all students whom the
University looks upon as “best.” ‘

“I shall attempt here to state brief-

[of the affair.

BR. FINEEAN PRESENTS
mm A1‘ ASSEMBLY

At the General Assembly last
Wednesday Dr, Thomas E. Finegan
outlined the prograrmof the State De-
partment of Public Education, the
program generally known as “The

-Finegan Program,” though be dis-

claimed the honor of that name, for,
he said, the program was formulated
by a group of 1,500 public educators
in convention at Harrisburg.

The Finegan program is as follows:
first, to make opportunities for public
education equal in all sections and
communities of the State. Dr. Fine-
gan stated that the pupils in the rural
districts had'IIo end of disadvantage
in their education, due to shortage of
schools, lack and unpreparedness of

‘ teachers, lack of funds, etc. He stated

that one-third of all pupils in the
grade schools came from the rural
districts, while only one-tenth of the
students in the high schools came
from the same districts.

Second, to raise the daily attend-
ance in the schools from 74 per cent,
as it is at present, to 92 per cent.
There are at present 26 out of every
100 students absent from school every

day of the school year.. That means

that the State is losing $26,000,00 out
of the $100,000,000 that it is spend-
iing on public education every year.
Third, to require the teachers to be
better qualified. Dr, Finegan quoted
statistics which show the deplorable
condition of the teaching profession
in this state. He stated that there

were more than 5,000 teachers in the
public schools of the State who had

never attended high school, and that
after September 1, 1927, no teacher
will be able to enter the teaching
service in Pennsylvania who has not
completed a high school course and a
course in college or normal training
school.

Fourth, to revise the public fund
system for public education. The
chief reason for .this is to create a
better distribution offunds in order
that the rural schools may be better
equipped and better administrated.

The University Band, favored the
assembly with the overture,“Poet and
Peasant,” which it played so well at
both its home concert and the assem-
bly. ' _

Chancellor J. G. Bowman presided
at the assembly, and Bishop Cortlandt
Whitehead, of the Pittsburgh Epis-
copacy,” offered prayer.

The University will entertain Civic
Oratorical League and its officers at
assembly, May 3. The Oratorical
contest, which is an annual affair will
be held at the general assembly, so
that all Pitt students will have_ the
opportunity to hear the best orators
in the Eastern colleges. Gregg Mil-
ligan will represent Pitt. Milligan

 

‘ is a member of the Delta Sigma Rho

honorary debate and oratory frater-
nity, and has been prominent in de-
bate circles for the past two years.

 ‘The colleges tobe represented are:
Allegheny College, Washington and
Jefferson, Wooster, Ohio Wesleyan,
Colgate University, and the Univer-
sity. The contest is held at the re-
spective schools each year, making
the event here in Pittsburgh one
which happens only at six-year inter-
vals. The orations are on current
subjects, and judging from past con-'
‘tests, they are masterpieces of ora-
tory and rhetoric. Pitt students are
urged to invite their friends to at-
tend, and the manager of Debating
and Oratory extends an invitation to
alumni from the various schools rep-
resented. v

DELTA SICMA RHO  
ELECTS NEW MEN

At the meeting of Delta Sigma Rho
held on the evening of April. 18, some
important matters were discussed.
The ﬁrst was the choice of a delegate
to represent the fraternity in General
Council which meets in Iowa‘ City,
Iowa, with the University of Iowa
Chapter as the host, tomorrow, Fri-
day and Saturday. H. Russell Stabl-
mann was chosen to represent the 10-
cal chapter. I

The election of new men was then
considered. The following were de-‘
cided upon favorable: John D. S.
Truxall, John M. Walker, E. J. Levy,
Chauncey E. Pruger, J. M. Ewing,
Herman C. Hemans, and Benjamin
Davidson. Coach G. C. Brosius was
also elected to membership in recog-
nition of his un-tiring efforts with the
squad. This was possible‘ inasmuch
as Professor Brosius had fulﬁlled the
requirements for members in previous
years. The other men elected were
chosen on the merits of their attain-
mens along forensic lines, either dur-
ing the late season or during some
previous year. -
All arrangements for the annual
post-season banquet to be tendered
the entire active squad of this year,
including the time and place of same,
were placed in the hands of the man-
ager of debating, J. B. Held. At this
affair the entire squad is the guest
of the debate association. It is
planned that at a later date a strictly
Delta Sigma Rho dinner will be given
at which time the above men will be
initiated. The election of officers was
delayed until the later meeting.

ficers were elected: President, Frank

tention on all phases of industrial em-
ployment and personnel administra-
tion.

(Continued From Page One.)

The
statement is necessarily somewhat ab-
stract, but it is one which I believe
that you will heartily, accept‘ as a
guide in the task -before you, because
it is ‘descriptiveinot only of the char-

University, but also of the -tradition
of the University reaching (back more
than a hundred years. These points

, are as follows:

“1. Health and Physical Fitness:
The ideal student knows that ‘full
mental development comes only with
health and. physical ﬁtness. iHe de-
velops the muscles of G1 s body
through right exercise and has due
regard‘ for his physical Awelfare in
matters of personal hygiene, sleep,

A and food.

I “2. iHabits of '1"hinki.ng: The ideal

‘ student makes of all new information

the stuff -or material for doing things.
“Through a habit of mental‘ alertness
he relates the new information which
he acquires, ﬁrst, to his own experi-
ence and, second, looking forward, to
the mark of attainment which he has
set as the purpose of this life. He
makes tools of success out of new
factsf Grades of scholarship or

“mar ” are to.‘hinr of minor impor-

- tance comparedato his power to “deal’:’

with new information, to observeand
to test its value in his own personal
equation. Accurate and sound sch-ol-

, arship is essential, -but such scholar-

ship through a habit of mental nim-
-blenesxs ‘becomes to ‘him *5 .1,1S»a.b1e Apart

. of his intellectual inventory and not
, merely a. litter of information which

vaguely he may later find. useful.
93. Ideal of Success:

thusiasm the challenge that he must
cope with the environment which

law, medicine,‘ or »business; and that

~ he must succeed in this struggle and.

be happy in the succeeding. _ Alltof
this is practical. But the ideal stu-
dent does not limit his aim with the

' practical. . He accepts alsofiwith cour-
-age and enthusiasm la, heavier weight.

of -duty A than falls upon those less

self. All -of the force in him vibrates
with an impulse of. service. - I-Ie dis-
ciplines ‘himself into "simplicity and is
not puffed up. He lives in a spirit
of eagerness and sincerity, and of
en,thu‘siasm and ‘devotion to a cause
which makes for the happiness of his
fellows as wellas of himself. His
supreme effort is the mastery of char-
acter which will fit him as an intel-
lectual guide, -a moral guide, and a
spiritual guide. , ,

“As an essential in success the ideal
student.include's a sound ‘understand-
ing of the machinery and spirit of
government. Matters of the penna-
nence and ‘honor of his city, state, and
federal government are impulsively
his du-ties. He looks up with affec-
tion to the great men of former
generations in his country and ﬁnds
in their lives both the light of his
country’s history and the inspiration
of patriotism. 3

“4. Culture: The ideal student,Vas
already implied, enters fully and free-
ly into the lives of others a/bout” him.
The capacity to enter into other lives,
to grow in the "power to inﬂuence or

A to leadothers, and to perfect day by

day the" accuracy of perceiving the
meanings of other lives are what is
called culture. The ideal student has
culture; without it his education is
nothing. If he has it he has ‘aid in
a foundation of broad intelligence for
stronger than any superstructure of

_ narro-w_ technical knowledge which

may later bewbuilt upon it.

.“But the point here is that the
teaching of the University_ must
necessarily come partly from the
faculty and partly from the students
themselves. When students “mix”

another, and they teach one another.
New ideas and « fresh matters of
thought, frequently the most vivid
and lasting that ever come to a -stu-
dent, are acquired in this way as’ the

student accepts active responsibility
for ‘his’ share of the teaching; in all
that he“ laughs at, approves, disap-
proves, says, or -does,‘ he” is true to
his own mark of attainment, to the
highest welfare in every way of, his
fellows, and to the great purpose for
which the University stands in its
community.” S

The letter in which Senator Pep-
per oifered the award follows:
“My Dear Mr. Bowman: 1

“.I- beg leave to place at the dis-
posal of the Chancellor the honorar-
ium which I have received from the
University.“ I suggest that at the
Commencement, 1922, an award of
$100 be made by the -Chancellor to
the student, man ‘or Woman, in any
class, in ‘any department, who shall
be designated -by a committee of stu-
dents as conforming most closely to
the type which in their judgment is
the type that the University should
aim to produce. The Committee (I
further suggest) should be composed
of one representativeof each class in
each department, chosen by his or her
classmates, and each person so chosen
should accept office without previous
commitment respecting the person to

When the committee meets the Chan-
cellor shoul preside and should be
permitted to express his views upon
the principles of selection, without in-
dicating individuals or voting upon
theaward.
“Faithfully yours,

‘(‘§Vigned) “George Whartbn Pepper.

"To the Editor ofithe Pitt Weekly:

An incident which occurred» in one.
of« the ‘professional schools of the
Univers‘lt,y brought, before. me -more
clearly than! everlthe necessity for '
one particular change" in a custom
that prevails aong our undergradu-
ates.’ In my ’undergradua.t'ionL days I
found it tohave been a.‘ -custommfor
the ‘male students’ to wear their hats

it. will be to choose a -member of the
school whom they consider is the ideal
type’ of student that -the University
should turn out each year. Is it
necessary that the work of th-atibodyl
of students be completed‘ after this
particular task has been ﬁnished? The
committee willrbe a very re«presenta-
tive body in my estimation. Why not
make it larger and then -keep it func-
tioning -with the Student‘ Senate? I
think that there will be enough prob-
lems come up that will be solved more
to thevvill of the general student body
because of its cosmopolitan make ‘up.

o'clock with the fag: Bethany outﬁt.
The Bethany team is coached by
“Katy” Easterday, former Pitt foot-
ball and baseball star, who has sent
word that the team he is bringing
this year will make a lot of trouble
for his Alma Mater. 

The Bethany team is casting
glances at the Tri-State title, and
they ‘can be counted upon, to be well
up in the running. Bethany has a pair
of ﬁnelhurlers iﬁ Randolph and Wells,
and Esterday said he is going to give
the -big Connellsville boy a chance to
revenge the defeat Pitt handed him
last year. If Randolph is not found’
in the box,cit is a sure thing that he
will occupy his place in left ﬁeld, as

at the top of collegiate isluggers, and
he has gained the ‘‘rep’’ of “‘.B‘abe

of his home run record.‘ The Bison
leader has made -some changes in the
lineup lately ' which have strength-
ened his team greatly.

On Friday, the Pitt team will meet
the Grove City team at Trees Eield
and this game,itoo, holds promise of
being a hard contest. The boysfrom
up state have always caused trouble
for Pitt, the Panthers defeating them
last year in a ver  lose game. On

failed to try once more, of enthusiasm, and in-
