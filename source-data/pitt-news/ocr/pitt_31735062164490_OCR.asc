Annual Band Concert Features

Original Student
By NANCY DELANEY

The University’s 7 0-piece concert band
will present its annual spring concert March
5 at 8:30 p.m. in Carnegie Music Hall. The
program will include an original composi-
tion by bass clarinetist Larry Bernfeld.

The band, under the direction of Robert
L. Arthur, will play symphonic and con-

temporary works, Broadway and Hollywood
musicals,‘ and marches and novelties. Tickets are

$1, and can be obtained from band members, at
the Student Desk in the Cathedral, at the Towers’
Desk, and at the Student Union Desk.

The work by Bernfeld is the second movement
from his “Sonata for Band and Piano.” Bernfeld,
a senior political science honors major, will play

the piano in the performance. At last April's,

Spring Concert, the band performed his original

Composition

Weber; a solo quintet, “Five Mellow Winds,” by
Schanke; a four-part suite, “French Quarter,” by
Morrissey; and one movement from Jager’s con-
temporary “Symphony for Band” _will also be per-
formed.

Besides the annual concert, the band makes a
tour of high schools and colleges each spring. Plans
for this year, although still incomplete, include re-
turn visits to the University's campuses at Johns-
town and Bradford, where last spring, according
to the local newspaper, “the versatility of the band
completely captured the audience.” The Bradford
Era also referred to the University’s band as “tal-
ented and beautifully disciplined.”

Bernfeld describes the movement from his Son-
ia that will be presented in March as “show mov-
ing .and written in ternary form. While dissonances
are an important part of the underlying chord

  

woodwind sextet, entitled “Invention for Wood-

winds.”

The show tunes in the concert include “Hello
Dolly,” “How the West Was Won,” and “Mary
Poppins.” The overture  Earyanthe,” by Von

structure, the overall effect of the second move-
ment is melodious.”

Bernfeld has been studying for two years with
Professor Robert Griswold of the Music Dept.

Wesley Salmon called the book
“remarkable in scope” and “a
signiﬁcant contribution to con-
temporary philosophy of science.”

Since coming here in 1960, Dr
Grunbaum has been director of
the University’s Philosophy of
Science Center, one of only two
such centers in the country. He

1. Symphony

   

By BILL SIVIITH .
Carlo Maria Giulini, Zino
Francescatti, and the Pitts-

‘ burgh Symphony combined

talents last weekend at Syria
Mosque in an obvious at-
tempt to unnerve music crit-
ics who have to ﬁnd some-

 ._ thing to criticize in order to

justify their existence and plac-
ate their egos. The former group
of distinguished musicians played
music the way it should be play-
ed, and it is difficult to know
where to begin praising.

The concert began with Ver-
di’s “Overature to La Forza del
Destino” and the Italian conduc-
tor‘Giulini gave a lively and spir-
ited interpretation. He was care-
ful with accents, phrasing, cres-
cendo and diminuendo markings,
yet with his bold manner of con-
ducting he captured the tunmul-
tuous essence of the work.

The overture is a nice work,
perhaps a good work, and cer-
tainly an exciting one. But Giu-
lini and company made it a great

"work last Friday night.

Giulini’s dynamic mannerisms

merited both pleasure and ad-
miration. His down beats were
slashing thrusts that were as of-
ten to the side as down. He threw
upbeats to the rafters and occa-
sionally, when the music ' indi-
cated double forte or accent, he
cupped both hands together and
tore the air as if holding a heavy
medneval sword instead of a
mere baton. His cut‘-offs were
crisp and his control excellent.
With feet planted ﬁrmly, knees
bent and back arched, he twist-
ed, gyrated, and weaved his way
to masterful interpretations of
the Veri and Beethoven works.

Zino Francescatti, a paragon
of conﬁdence, performed bril-
liantly in the Sibelius violin con-
certo in D minor. Any disappoint-
ment the audience may have
had in not hearing the Walton
violin concerto originally sched-
uled was quickly allayed when
Francescatti’ magniﬁcent tone
(true in all registers), expert mu-
sicianship, and excellent taste be-
came apparent.

The scale-like and arpeggio

passages were executed ﬂawless-

ly; the double, triple, and quad-'

ruple stops rang out clearly and
the series of octaves and sixths
were impeccably in tune. Har-

monics were clean. Trills were.

even, and leaps of an octave or
more were handled skillfully,
even when it was impossible to
handle them effortlessly.

For a few brief episodes dur-
ing the ﬁrst and last movements
the pace became so hectic that
the soloist and orchestra appear-
ed to have trouble staying to-
gether. This w.as not the case,
however, for the composition oc-
casionally has soloist and accom-
paniment in jagged rhythmic jux-
taposition.

The audience responded so fav-
orably to Francescatti’s perform-
ance that he played for an encore
the last movement of “Sonata
for Unaccompanied Violin” by
Paul Ben-Haim, a contemporary
Israeli composer. Although there
was ample opportunity to hear
the violin soloist alone _ in the
concerto, the Ben-Haim piece dis-
pelled any doubts about the beau-

ty and strength of Francescatti’s
playing.

The concert ended on a happy
note with a solid reading of Bee-
thoven's sixth symphony. Giulini
was almost constantly faithful to
the score and his g00d musical
sense resulted in a balanced
sound that‘ reflected the shifting
moods Beethoven wanted the lis-
tener to experience.

A The cheerful simplicity of the
first movement; the peaceful lyri-
cal beauty of the scene by the
brook where one hears birds sing-
ing (trilling of the violins) and
water (imaginatively .written in
the 16th note accompaniment,
usually in the lower strings); the
famous storm scene which inter-
rupts the merry-making of the
country folk (conducted a slower
tempo than Beethoven indicated),
and the ﬁnal feeling of thanks
after the storm—were communi-
cated with freshness and compe-

tent musical understanding.

The concert was one of the best
of the year.

Speaks to Joint Seminar  

Stanford Dean Resigns

Collegiate Press Service

Two Stanford University students have
issued a report charging Dean of Women
Lucile Allen with attempting to manipulate
the actions of the student judicial council.

It was announced on Thursday that
Dean Allen, because of the pressure of Uni-
versity opinion, had voluntarily submitted
her resignation. In the letter of resignation, Miss
Allen insisted that charges leveled at her were
without 'foundation.

The 16-page report, prepared by Darrell Hal-
verson, former chairman of the men’s judicial
council, and Nora Crow, former chairman of the
women’s judicial council, charges that Dean Allen
“has demonstrated her misunderstanding of the
student judiciary in her attempts to control its
politics."

The report was the result of a conversation
which took place last spring between Dean Allen
and members of the judicial council. At that time
Dean Allen allegedly urged council action against
supposed -attempts by younger professors in the
English department to sexually arouse women in
their classes.”,

Halverson and Crow attribute Dean Allen with
saying, “the young professors arouse the girls sex-
ually. They concentrate deliberately on the erotic
aspects of literature, in part, because those who
are unmarried use literature as their sexual outlet,
and, in part, becuase they wish to seduce the girls
in their classes.

According to the report Dean Allen asked mem-
bers of the women’s council to take notes in their
English classes on anything objectionable they
heard. She then told the council that the informa-
tion _would be given to the senior members of the

department, who would reprimand their colleagues.

The report continues by saying that Dean Al-
len, when asked whether such information would
inﬂuence promotional decisions, replied that the

professors in question did not deserve promotion.

Dean Allen has denied the statements, saying
that the student version of the discussion of sex
and the English department was completely fabri-
cated.

“I can’t imagine where they got this,” she said.
However, she did say that “it was at a woman’s
council meeting nine months ago that one of the
members said she objected to some subjects given

_ freshman girls. I told her, ‘If you will verify this,

I'll be glad to talk to the chairman of the English
department about it.’ That was the last I heard
of it.”

Four of the girls who attended the meeting.

signed sworn affidavits verifying the statements
attributed to Dean Allen by the report.

Halverson and Miss Crow said they withheld
submission for their report until their terms on
the judicial council expired. Because of Dean Al-
len’s alleged inﬂuence on the councils, Halverson
and Miss Crow feared unfavorable repercussions
if they acted before their terms expired.

In a copyrighted story, the Stanford. Daily has
pointed out that the real issue is not the morality
of the English department but deﬁning the role
of the student council and student judiciary
members.

The reports Dr. John D. Black of the Counsel-
ing and Testing Service on the problems of the
administrator who “is asked to balance his re-
sponsibilities to the student body and the institu-
tion as a whole against the rights of the individual
studen .” Dr. Black suggests that such an adminis-
trator should be “no longer disciplinarian, but
only counselor.”

The student legislature did assert, however,
“that the Associated Students of Stanford Univer-
sity shall have sole jurisdiction over student af-
fairs and conduct." This is in direct conﬂict with

_ a Board of Trustees resolution three years ago

establishing control of student discipline as a
function of the deans.

In September Student Government opened both barrels on what promised then to
be a year-long battle for student rights. President John Vrana’s Senate in its ﬁrst meet-
ing opposed a Pennsylvania sales tax on school supplies, asked for a student discount at
the Book Center, and advocated the return of the Student ID Card proﬁt to activities-

istration to achieve them.

7 all of which demanded this recognition but still needed a basic rapport with the admin-

Student leadership had gained a signiﬁcant foothold during the summer when it
pushed for curb cuts for handicapped students, but it still took the fall and winter terms
to re-emphasize their interest and responsibility and to establish the fact that they de-
served the rapport they demanded.

Gradually more responsibility shifted to student hands. The Student Affairs Com-
mittee set up an allocation board which included students in the distribution of funds to
student owned organizations. his became even more important recently when Vice-Chan-
cellor Lawrence Monnett agreed to split Book Center proﬁts 50-50 with the students, giving
the subcommittee even more responsibility with the added funds as well as realizing the
earlier SG goal. The approximately $3200. in ID Card proﬁts similarly would go back for
student distribution into student organizations, Monnett promised, and the administration
is concertedly working with Students on an Activity Fee that would “even further in-
tensify student responsibility and independence. ,

The Student Affairs Committee itself, just put into operation again last year, has
developed into a vital organization that sometimes meets more often than its bi-weekly
schedule just to get everything in. That battle for student rights has been won with set-
tlements beyond expectations but the results can only be insured by a responsible shift

in command.

The elections today are crucial: pick every candidate with an eye. towards his
place in this crusade—-not only the SG president but each senator and each candidate for
the women’s positions. We can not afford to be smug.

 

Until the publication of the

‘Feb. 19 issue of The Pitt News I

have looked upon some of its
contents with detached amuse-
ment. I am no longer amused.
The up-coming SG election is
worthy of some serious attention
by the University and all of the

‘ student body.

The candidacy of Eric Stern
as an independent is making a

. mockery of the elective system.

In a system of free speech and
press I do not question his right
to express his views or of The
Pitt News to print them. In fact,
I think both parties have a duty
to do so. However, if one but
takes a few minutes and gives

‘careful consideration to the pro-

gram advocated by Mr. Stern it
becomes obvious that this can-
didacy is nothing more than an
attempt to gain notoriety.

Without any administrative
representation his suggestion of
reevaluation of distribution of

V . studies and major requirements

is unrealistic. If students know
so much‘ about such phenomena
then they have reason to be here

. in the ﬁrst place. A self-chosen~
, faculty committee does not con-

note administrative representa-
tion.

Since Mr. Stern’ wants the stu-
dents to control almost every-

 thing relative to the University
 [I can’t understand why he does

not favor a co-op to operate the

it 1 Book Center. A discount means

very little, why not just lower
the prices?

He‘ would place the non-aca-
demic services under SG control
sans administration. How naive
can one be? Perhaps my experi-
ence is more limited than Mr.

‘-7 . Stem’s but I'm not familiar with

many colleges where undergrad-
uate dormitory students are not
required to have meal tickets.
Next this candidate advocates
affiliation with a national stu-
dent organization. On a “hand-
out” slipped under the door to
my room by his co-workers
(which, incidentally, I consider
an invasion of my privacy), he

  suggests the National Student As-

 

 

sociation. This organization has
acquired a questionable reputa-
tion through some of its activ-
ities and proposals. In fact, a
number of colleges have with-
drawn from it because it has .ad-
vocated some unrealistic policies.

He also proposed the creation

of an intellectual environment.

where intellectual dialogues could
take place. ' If this includes such
discussions as I have overheard
in the lobbies of the towers by
the bearded ones with boots and
guitars then I wish to remain
incogitative.

Mr. Stem’s entire candidacy ap-
pears to rest on rebellion against
the present administrative and
faculty policies. Looking at the
picture of this candidate in The
Pitt News I, for one, do not care
to have this bearded pseudo-in-
tellectual appear to the public
as my concept of a SG president.
If he is Orthodox, then my
apologies; otherwise, nix to Stern.

This is just one more case of
unrest among the mis-ﬁts in the
university climate. They clamor
for more “Freedom” when they
don’t know what freedom really
is. They scream for more re-
sponsibility when they do not
show evidence of being willingto
accept it and the maturity it
requires.

. Shall we turn our food service
over to the stringy-haired fugi-
tives from Macbeth who park
their brooms beside their tables?
Or to the long-haired bearded
ones who make the guitar manu-
facturers rub their hands with
glee? Or to both? Perhaps those
who throw food and sugar pack-
ets about the cafeterias will plan
and execute the menus. These
individuals would have us GIVE
them responsibility and respect
when they have earned neither.

People such as this have creat-
ed unrest and strife in other uni-
versities in this country. They
have seemingly lost respect for
the precepts and principles of
the mature members of our so-
ciety. No situation is perfect in a
free society but those who would
rebel against established success-
ful policies only exhibit their
immaturity, lack of realism, and
create unrest among those too

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR I

  Stern Attacked
-On Candidacy

. Editor, The Pitt News:

myoptic to see their true intent.
The road to suppression is built
by those who advocate “free-
dom” and “something for noth-
ing” and is traveled by those who
are too lazy and greedy to work
within the successful parameters
already in existence.

Vote for Stem if you would
have increased costs, less serv-
ice, and fewer choices in our
cafeterias.

Vote for Stem if you would
have ‘chaos in the administrative
operation of this university.

Vote for Stem. if you would
align yourself with a question-
able national organization.

Vote for Stem if you would
be represented and governed by
the inept, insecure, immature,
unrealistic pseudo-intellectuals.

Vote for Stern if you would
preserve the ridiculous garb,
atrocious manners, and the cry-
babies who ,want respect and
responsibility without ‘working to
earn them.

Vote for Stem if you would
have this University become an-
other Orwell Animal Farm.

On the other hand, you can
vote intelligently!

Correction Made
In ‘News’ Story

Editor, The Pitt News:

I appreciated your article of

Feb. 12 on the Campus Oratory.
There is one obvious error which
needs correcting. It was stated
that the Oratory was founded
in 1961 “By Bishop John J.
Wright speciﬁcally to save the
graduates, undergraduates and
faculties of the University.” I am
quite convinced, with my inti-
mate contact with the Oratory,
that their Purpose is to serve
rather than to save. '
u The Oratory is a creative force
in the University. Your readers
should not be misled by this
typographical error.

Viet Nam Solution

  By Wolfram Swoboda

In 1963, in his newly published book, The Two Viet
Nams, Bernard Fall called for a re-thinking of the purpose
and strategy of the involvement of the United States in the
Vietnamese conﬁict. Now, in 1965, United States policy (as
far as it exists at all) blunders on in southeast Asia, as
thoughtless and directionless "as ever.

Yet, actual involvement of the U.S. constitutes only part
of the problem; the acceptance of military intervention in
South Viet Nam on the part of the American public is
equally disturbing. And it is for this reason that a re-eva1u-
ation of American policy should appear at this time.

United States involvement in South Viet Nam stems
from an open violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords, which
provided for the temporary division of Viet Nam into two
parts to be reunited by plebescite in 1956. Though the
United States did not sign this agreement itself, it did
agree not to alter its terms “by force.” The plebescite, how-
ever, was never held, since the Bao Dai regime of South
Viet Nam, realizing full-well that any free election would
result in a victory for Ho Chi Minh, refused to enact the
terms of the Geneva agreement. It was backed in this action
by the United States, which since that time has managed
to establish and support a succession of illegal and unpopu-
lar governments.

AS THE SOURCE of power and direction behind this
series of dictatorial satellite regimes, the United States
has, for the Vietnamese people, simply taken the place of
the French colonialists. The Viet Cong, accordingly, is a
manifestation of the same popular resistance to Western
domination that drove out the French in 1954. Such anti-
colonialist spirit is, of course, inevitably branded as Com-
munist subversion by the U. S. press. ~

The war in Viet Nam is thus a civil war in which the
United States is taking, asit so often does, the side of an
anti-popular and dictatorial regime. The so-called advisory.
group constitutes an arm of terror in the service of the
Saigon government. And the difficulty which that govern-
ment has in mustering an army indicates that U.S. “ad-
visory” forces will be the only reliable military support of
any U.S.-sponsored regime. The American demand for a
stable government which is strongly pro-western and anti-
Commuiiist can be fulfilled only by a garrison state, as is
evidenced by the continual coups-d’ etat and instructions.

And a garrison state would be impossible without United H

States arms and assistance. _ _

On the other hand, the Viet Cong receives. both _the
sympathy and the support of the mass of the Vietnamese
poeple. The Viet Cong is essentially a popular and indigen-
ous resistance movement; without ‘popular sympathy 11_0
such movement, aided from the outside or not, could possi-
bly exist. (The degree of reliance by the Viet Cong on the
staging bases bombed in U.S. “retaliatory” raids is negligi-
ble, as pointed out_ by New York Tim'es news analyst Charles
Mohr). Further, since napalm bombs and air_-borne machine
gunners cannot distinguish peasant from Viet Cong, ‘every
new government air attack reinforces the identiﬁcation of

the two.

INSOFAR AS THE United States seeks to win the
war without the Vi_etnamese people it IS laboring under an
illusion. “For civilian support, as Bernard Fall demoﬁi-
strates, “is the essential element of a successful gueri a
operation, and a national guerilla-warfare policy thﬁt <_i0WI}‘
grades that element most certainly warrants rethinking‘ If
victory is ever to be achieved.” _ ”

From the recent American “retaliatory attacks on
North Viet-Nam,» it seems as though the United States
seeks to establish a new Roman Peace in south-east Asia
(solitudinem faciunt, .pacem appellant)- Yet. the Problem
will not disappear with the reign Of 3 8'1‘?-VeYa1'd Peace-
Americans are dying in Viet-Nam: any attempt to express
the lamentability of that fact is necessarily an understate-
ment; worse, they and the conscripts of the South Vietna-

'mese government are being sacrificed to preserve a govem-

ment the South Vietnamese do not want. . t_
The fate of Viet-Nam depends on_U.S. P011CY- C911 111'

South Viet Nam, a North Viet Nam eventually drawn Open-

Computer Seen Worse Than  

By JAY GLASSEB

K} ’~

Humans at Matchmaker ole

“The computer is worse
than the human matchmak-
ers” commented sophomore
Francine Williams at the
Computer Dance Saturday
night.

The Circle Club sponsored
the dance, and Porky Chadwick
from radio station WAMO was

, the disc jockey. The idea of be-
ing mated by a computer and the
chance of seeing some current
popular recording groups in per-
son, attracted a crowd of over
1,200. The Stereos provided most
of the entertaintment with Chuck
Osborne and the Shadows also

‘* appearing. The highlight of the

evening was to have been the
appearance of the Fenways, but
because of illness they were un-
able to perform.

The 214 couples who were
matched by the computer were
drawn by the novelty of having
a machine select their date for

 the evening. Many hypothesized

that the computer couldn't do
any worse than they would do
otherwise; but some were still
mismatched: a 22-year-old wom-
an graduate student was match-
ed to a freshman boy and a 5’9”
girl was matched to a 5'4” boy.
The worst mistake by the com-
pester was matching two boys.
The matching was hampered
by the fact that many people
were afraid to put on their num-
bers before they saw their date.
Vice-president Marvin Zelkowitz
explained after the dance “the
reason there were so many loose
people is that many just came
from curiosity, never intending
to stay with their partners."
Whether they were matched or
not, almost everyone thought
that being matched by a com-
puter was a good idea. Two girls
from Geneva College who were
attracted by hearing Chadwick

In Vietnam Protest

(CPS)—Seven George Washington University students
began a fast for peace in Vietnam last Friday. Calling on
students throughout the country to take up the fast, the
seven vowed not to eat until the fasting had spread to other
campuses. - ’

The students, members of the Washington, D.C. school’s
Students for Peaceful Alternatives, appealled for a ”cessa.
tion of hostilities by all combatant parties in Vietnam . . .
We appeal for arbitration of the conﬁict by the United Na-

tions or some other appropriate '
international agency,” they said.

"Over 2,000,000 pies sold" '

The students are continuing
to attend classes while they are
fasting. Other schools participat-
ing in the fast include the Uni-
versity of Maryland, American
University, the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkely, and Stephens
College. It is expected that Johns

With It

  By Marvin Zelkowitz

THE BOB MARIN STORY

COACH BOB Timmons says that Bob Marin was “just one
of those cases.” A case like Jack Marin, or J eff Newman, or

Dave Brown.

When Bob Marin was a senior at Farrell High
School, his father was approached by Bob Timmons
about a basketball scholarship. “Don’t let Bob do any-
thing until you hear from us,” ’I‘immons said.

- So Bob and his father waited. They waited for the
Pitt coach to call, but he never called. Bob’s father
Steve still is dismayed at ’I‘immons’ failure to call.

Tiimnons had missed a chance to recruit Bob’s
older brother, Jack, when Timmons failed to show for
an appointment. “I was sure he wouldn’t make the
same mistake with Bob,” Mr. Marin said.

“So we waited and waited to hear from Pitt,” but
nothing happened. So we took Louisville.

So Bob Marin accepted a scholarship to Louisville.
He plays with a freshman team that averages 107-
points per game. He starts on the team and has main-
tained a 16-point per game average. .

He plays with a team so strong that they defeated
the Louisville varsity, before 5,000 fans. Marin is the
second leading rebounder on the team with a 14 per
game average. That’s six higher than Pitt’s leading

rebounder, Bob Lovette. Louisville fans say that the-

freshman team will replace the varsity next year, man
for man.

Bob Marin was not a brilliant student at Farrell
but he was qualiﬁed for admission -here. He was a low
B student with an 1100’s total on his college boards.

Timmons admits that Marin was qualiﬁed for Pitt,

but he still didn’t take him. Even Brian Generalovich,
who played basketball here for three years, and played
at Farrell before that, was at a loss to explain why
'I‘immons did not take Bob Marin, after showing so
much interest in him. “I just don’t know what hap-
pened,” Generalovich said.

But Timmons was not the only coach to show
interest in Bob Marin. Penn State coach John Egli had
a scholarship waiting for Marin if he wanted it. Ap-
parently, Bob Marin did not want to attend Penn State,
and Timmons did not want him.

Timmons says he didn’t want Bob Marin because
‘he couldn’t get along with his high school coach. “I
didn’t think he would ﬁt in,” Timmons said. “He was
not highly recommended to us. If he couldn’t get along
with his high school coach, then we can’t get along
with him.” -

This would seem like a valid excuse, but 'I‘immons
has several basketball players now that are disciplin-
ary problems. And they are more mature and reserved
now than they*were in laitigh school.

-THE HOT LINE . . . One football coach is reportedly leav-
ing the staff . .. . Asophomore back on the team might leave

also . . . Talk at the athletic department says that
FrankCarver will not go out of the University com-
munity for his next wrestling coach. Reason? Budget
problems.

Frosh Basketball Team
Hosts Westminster Tonight

The freshman basketball team hosts the Westminster

Junior Varsity tonight at 6:15" at the Field House. West-
minster defeated the Cubs, 76-66 earlier in the season.

The frosh have lost three straight away games since

they last won on their home court two weeks ago against
Point Park. Each game was close; each game was lost at
the beginning of the second half.

Johnstown topped the Cubs,
69-66; St. Vincent won, 71-67, and
Slippery Rock squeaked by, 75-
70 “It was the third quarter in
all of those games,” said coach
Carl Peterson. “We can’t seem to
play the same type of ban right
after the intermission. If we
could, I'm positive that our rec-
ord wouldn’t be 3-11.

Only two games remain on the
frosh schedule after tonight’s en-
counter. They battle Steuben-
ville here Saturday and Carnegie
Tech at Tech one week from

Tracksters Meet
Mounties Today

The track team will compete
against the track squad from
West Virginia University today
at the Field House. The meet is
an exhibition and will serve to
prepare the Mountaineers for
their upcoming Southeastern Con-
ference championships, and the
Panthers" for their trip to the
Baltimore Invitationals on the
27th of the month. The events
begin at 3.

  Undefeated Le all Top W

restler

LEE HALL shows winning form as he applies hold
to an opponent. Hall holds an 18 match unbeaten

dual-meet record, and his 7-0-2 record makes him a
top prospect for the Eastern 177-lb. championship.

Tankmen

Trio Face
Last Meet

Three swimmers appear in
their ﬁnal contest Saturday when
the team travels to Michigan
State for a triangular meet with
the Spartans and Wisconsin.

Co-captain Ed Coleman, an en-
gineering major, performed well
in the diving competition this
year, winning four ﬁrsts and
placing second twice.

Frank Reed and Jay Adlers-
berg, senior liberal artsstudents,
didn’t see as much action as Cole-
man because both fought colds
during the year. Reed, who
swims in the 200 and 500-yard
freestyle events, captured one
first and four seconds while Ad-
lersberg, used sparingly by coach
Ben Grady, goes in the breast-
stroke. _

Swimming in the 50 and 100-
yard freestyle events, Andy
James will attempt to make the
cut-oﬁ times for the Eastern Col-
legiate Championships to be held
at Yale. “James must lower his
50 to :22.1 and his 100 to :48.8,”
said Grady. To date his best
times are :23.3 in the 50 and :50.0
in the 100-yarder.

Wisconsin is ranked tenth na-
tionally, one notch below Michi-
gan State.

Wrestling captain Lee Hall
stretched his unbeaten dual-meet
streak to 18 last Saturday, de-
feating Lehigh’s Toni Narducci,
10-2. Hall remains the teams only
undefeated wrestler with a 7-0-2
record.

His two draws have been
against Syracuse’s highly - rated
sophomore Tom Chlendorf and
Cornell’s Fran Ferraro. Chlendorf
defeated last year’s 177-pound
Eastern champion Gerry Franzen
twice this season and Ferraro
was 7-2-2 last year.

Hall began his winning streak
last season, compiling a 9-0 rec-
ord in the 177-weight class. He
moved to 167 for the Easterns,,
losing his only match in two
years to Penn State’s Marty
Strayer.

Although Strayer has won ﬁve
of his nine matches this year in
the 177-weight class, he is sched-
uled to wrestle at 167 against
the matmen Saturday. A victory
against Penn State will give Hall
a 17-0-2 dual- meet record for
two years. Hall will probably re-
main at 177 for the Easterns.

Tom Baily, another senior, has
a less impressive winning skein
as a 157-pounder. Baily began
the season losing his ﬁrst four
matches, but has not lost since.
After winning his ﬁfth match in
three weeks against Lehigh’s Bob
Hartenstine Saturday, Baily be-
came the team’s ﬁfth-highest
point man with .a 5-4 record.

Baily placed third in the East-

erns as a 157-pounder last year .‘

and will probably remain at that
weight this year. He concludes
his dual-meet schedule Saturday
against Jerry Seaman.

Frank O’Korn and Dino Boni,
the team’s second and third point
men, attempt to win again Sat-

urday, after losing matches ,2’

against Lehigh.

O’Korn had a 7-1 record be-
fore facing Lehigh’s Bill Stuart,
but could not overcome the un-
defeated junior. Although he has
been wrestling at 147 all season,
O’Korn met Stuart as a 137-
pounder, and will remain at that

weight. He placed fourth at 137, ”

in last year’s Easterns.

Boni, who also placed in the
Easterns, lost his second conse-
cutive match against Lehigh, but
Peery still feels he “should be
Eastern champ this year.” Boni,
a junior, is one of only three
starters who returns next year”

The matmen now have a 4-5
record, but coach Rex Peery has
never had a team ﬁnish below
.500 since 1950.

ords are:

Gym Specialist Conquers Bar

Misage Reaches Peak in Recent Meets

By TOM SACKS

Among gymnastics per-
formers there is a feeling
that the sport offers a chal-

lenge and a little room for
creativity and the single
piece of apparatus which of-
fers the most room for creativity
is the high bar, according to
specialist Tom Misage.

The senior engineering stu-
dent who has been hampered
the past two years by a shoulder
injury has put on two of his
most satisfying performances in
the past several weeks against
Navy and West Virginia.

Misage outpointed Jerry Spen-
cer, the Mountaineers’ all-around
star, Saturday to win ﬁrst place.

“I don’t usually watch the rou-
tines going on directly before me,
but I had an idea that he had
broken his routine,” said Misage.
“It’s not a matter of him psych-
ing me out. .It’s just that I knew
in my own mind what I had to do
and it wouldn't have helped by
concentrating on his perform-
ance.”

In the four years that Misage
has been on the tea.m, he has
never seen the gym squad achieve
better than a .500 season. As co-
captain this year he might see
that barrier broken. The key
rests in the away Temple meet
Saturday. “It'll be an uphill
climb, but I think we can do it,”
conﬁded Misage.

The gymnastics specialist has
been practicing on the high bar

continually for a little over two
years now and he is yet to be

bored by this constant drilling,"

“In a sense it's fascinating. The
only time when boredom occurs
is when you realize that you're
not working up to your capacity.

“The high bar is a little more
scary than any other event. That
constant speed and force involved

could result in an injury if you /_

make a tiny slip. But I really’
enjoy working on it. It’s exciting
and the possibility for new tricks
offers a little room for creativ-
ity,” continued Misage.

“I wasn't drawn into gymnas-
tics negatively because I could-
n’t do anything else. I’ve just
always felt challenged by the

mastering of new tricks and the”

molding together into .a routine."

“To His Inside Post

 

By FRANK SMIZIK
The basketball team goes after its sixth win tonight

when they host Westminster at the

starts at 8:15 p.m.

Field House. The game

Bob Lovett is 6 foot 5, a big man for a -basketball team
‘here, yet if he had his Way he'd play guard. At Pitt, how-
‘ever, a man of Lovett’s height has no choice but to be a

front court man.

At the beginning of the year
Lovett played center. He didn’t
enjoy the position and he didn’t
play it very well. Coach Bob
Timmons, however, had no one
else to play.

“\.~ When LaValley proved he

could start, Lovett moved to for-
ward where he could shoot his
best shot; a 15 to 20 foot jump-
er. “I don't mind playing under-
neath but I played forward in
high school and it’s a more nat-
ural position for me.”

“I’ve played a couple of good

‘végames against big men,” he said.

‘Bowman of Wichita had only
six points apainst me, and I
didn’t have much trouble scor-
ing against him.”

Lovett had a bad streak of - '

games and he just started to
score again. He hit for 18 points

;__against Temple and 23 against
*Geo.rge..._Washington last Satur-

Q

).

day. Earlier, when he was hav-
ing trouble, Timmons said “Bob
is ﬁghting himself on the court
and isn’t loose enough When he
makes a mistake he can't forget
it.”

Lovett seems to have worked
his problems out and is back On

‘the right track, but Timmons is
still working with him. “I haven’t
been following my shots and it
has really been showing the last
few games. The coach has been
making sure that I follow my
shots now.

“I was never too much of a
rebounder in high schoo ,” he
‘continued, “It’s not that I don't
have the hegiht or strength, its
just that I haven’t worked on it
enough” Although Lovett is the
leading rebounder on the team,

CLASSIFIED

he is only averaging eight re-
bounds a game. In addition to
working on his rebounding, Lov-
ett has 5 been doing extra work
on defense. “It’s strange, but I
was very good on defense in
high school. We’ve been working
a lot on man-to-man which I like
because it makes the game more
enjoyable. When a team. plays a
zone it’s just what team can hit
from 20 or 30 feet.”

‘ To be regarded by your team-
mates as the best shot ‘on the
team is an honor. .

MBA won its third con-
secutive victory without a
loss last week in Profession-
al “A” League play with a
64-28 win over the Senior

.Rebels. Hank Palmer paced

the league leaders with 14 points.
Bob’s Boys won their second
game in a row by beating the

Dent Seniors, 81-43.

In Professional “B" League
competition, Curt Hull hit for 27
points as the ﬁrst place Pulp Ex-
posers won over the Golden In-
lays, 66-42. The Plumbers held
on to the second spot by nipping
the Currettes, 52-40.

In other games, the Currettes
edged the San Blas Indians, 44-
41. Vince Ierardi. chipped in 14
points for the victors. Rick Lee-
son’s 33 point effort led the In-
lays to their ﬁrst victory by out-

scoring the Indians, 81-71.

The Industrials remained on
top of the heap in the Engineer-
ing League with two wins. Mike
Miga scored 30 points in their
68-34 victory over the Mechani-
cal Engineers. Bob Morrell pump-

ed in 20 points in an 83-30 win
against the Aeronauticals.

The Electrical Engineers also
won two games. They beat the
Aeros, 39-30, and outscored the
Civil Engineers, 81-54, as John
Maczuzak collected 38 points.

There are many mysteries
that have not been solved in
Pittsburgh and one in particu-
lar that directly affects Pitt
students and Oakland residents
—where is Oakland Avenue?
Well, the mystery has almost
been solved and all the clues
will soon be assembled as to
the whereabouts of those in-
volved in the dramatic scandal
to eliminate one of this fair

city’s most dis-
tinguished ave-
nues. The eld-
crs of this dis-
trict are proud
to relate all the
\ poignant stor-
‘ , ies about the
famous people
who have lived
and worked on
Oakland Ave-
nue. One of the
most famous,
Oﬁicer O’Land,
was part of the
drama of Oak-
land Avenue. It was Officer
O’Land’s duty to guard the sign
post at Forbes and Oakland,
(which at that time was nam-
ed Main St.) Every afternoon
at four, folly 0’,Land would
strike his immovable pose —
leaning against the sign post
twirling his night stick with
his left hand and his mustache
with his right thumb and index
ﬁnger-whenever a well-turned
gankle hobbled by. There he
was—that brave, tall silhouette
leaning into the setting sun.

But alas, one fine morning,
Officer 0’ Land didn’t greet the

those who had shopped on
Main for years find their
distinguished street. To their
dismay, both the sign and Of-
ﬁcer O’Land were missing.
What could have happened to
that brave silhouette leaning
into the setting sun in the still
of the night? All the sign pom
in the area were checked—no
other sign or oﬁicer was miss-

_ ing.,All possibilities were inves-

tigated. Not a rock was left un-
turned, nor a fraternity house
left unsuspected. Till this day
mystery surrounds this dual
disappearance

In memory of brave Oﬁicer
O’Land, who obviously never
left his sign post, Main Street
was renamed Oakland Avenue.
(AK are the initals of the coun-
ty oﬁicial present at the cere-
mony.) But in order to encour-

age the replacement of the old
Main Street sign, and possibly
old Officer O’Land, a new Oak-
land Avenue sign has never
been erected at the corner of
Forbes and Oakland avenues.
Although residents of the area
want to keep the memory

this mishap fresh in the minds
of all to discourage a similar
occurance, many people have
been inconvenienced by the ab-

sence af a sign designating
Oakland Avenue. One of the
most directly aﬁected is the
Pitt student. How, you may
ask? Here's how . . . by not
being able to find Oakland
Avenue they have been placed
at the disadvantage of not be-
ing able to partake of the valu-
able savings found at Bob’s

Bagdikian
Examines

Am. Poor

By NEIL A. GALLAGHER

“In molding you pour met-
al into one side of a form,
then turn the form over and

. pour the other side. You can

make various mistakes that
spoil the Work . . . I have to
admit the machine did a
better job than we men did.”

When John Merrick was pour-
ing metal for the Grinnel Cor-
poration he took home $120 a
week; when he spoke to Ben H.
Bagdikian, author of In the Midst
of Plenty: The Poor in America
(Signet Books, 160 pp., $.60), he
was doing odd jobs in the com-
pany labor pool, averaging $75
a week. As he says, “Seventy-
five dollars isn't enough for ten
kids.”

John Merrick is a Negro who
left North Carolina for better

.work up North; he is a man of

character, and he represents
one kind of poverty in
America. Edmund Macintosh,
alone, 74-years-old, and trying
to live on $50 a month, repre-
sents another; Jose Chico, a Pima
Indian barely supporting ﬁve
children on an Arizona dirt farm,
a third.

Why have these men, and the
other men and women whom
Bagdikian interviewed, failed?
Bazdikian examines the case of
the Southerner who heeds the
rule of going where the work is
and goes to a Northern city. This
new immigrant is unlikely to
find the unskilled job which was
the entrance to the labor force
for the immigrants from Europe.

- Since he may not_ read with
the proﬁciency assumed universal
by personnel oﬁicers and welfare
workers, he may ﬁnd the multi-
tude of forms intimidating. He
may have no car, or be unable
to decipher bus schedules, and
so have trouble getting to job in-
terviews miles away from where
he lives. Life in an apartment
building will mystify a person
Wh°Se 0111:? home has been a

- shack in Appalachia.

To soften the cultural shock,
there is no Little Appalachia in
Chicago corresponding to the om
Little Italy or Kerry Patch where
some of the old style of life is
preserved. After a while, if he
can scrape together the return
bus fare, the Southerner may go
back to the hills, where the des-
Deration is at least familiar.
(This is true only for the whites;
Negroes seldom return.)
