‘Activism Never Went To Sleep'

By DIANE R. POWELL.

Pitt News Staff Writer _ _
Local student, political and ClVll

rights activists agree that-black ac-
tivism is not reawakening; it never
“went to sleep.” They also believe

that the same conditions sparking

racial violence in Miami exist here
in this city.

Phil Carter, Black Political

Assembly chairman said, ‘‘I don’t.

think black activism died, dried up
or went to sleep. What happened
there was a fumbling and bumbling
around for alternative strategies to
address the problems of black peo-
ple.” .

I

Carter pointed out several

Goals And Timetables In Affirmative

strategies blacks used in the 70s in
an attempt to come up with
something new. He cites “attempts
to go the electoral politics route and
put blacks in position to have im-
pact on policy, conforming to what
white folks want you to do and
forget about the unity syndrome,
the reverting back to comb your
hair right, wear the latest clothes,
smile and get to know the right
white folks,” as several tactics.
Bob Pitts, vice-president of Pitts-_
burgh Urban League, agrees with
Carter that black activism never

' went anywhere. He said it became

“subdued” in the 705.

“Miami comes to the forefront
because it’s what everybody is look-
ing for,” he said. ‘

Racial violence in Miami, similar
to Detroit and Watts, erupted after
a jury of six white men aquitted
four white police officers in the
death of black insurance executive,
Arthur Duffe.

The possibility of a racial riot oc-
curring in Pittsburgh is very likely
according to the activists. Very
similar conditions are here and in
every other urban city with a large
population of blacks.

Ramona" Riscoe, Pitt’s Black Ac-
tion Society chairperson, attributes
the high rate of unemployment
among black youths as one of the
major problems. She recently did a
study of unemployment in this city.

Action Interpreted As Quotas

. As strenuous as the efforts of af-

firmative action programs to cor-
rect the past effects of discrimina-

V tion in hiring and employment are,

the well-meant programs are as
hard-hit with negative criticism as
are the discriminatory practices
they seek to destroy.

The infractions stemming from
these criticisms are numerous and
varied, while compliance is often a
subjective situation, a sum-total
review of unlimited ingredients in
the federal recipe of an affirmative
action program. '

, And in institutions of higher
education, many years the strong-
hold of established academic hiring
procedures, the criticism of affir-
mative action was a substantial fac-
tor in the rewriting and clarifica-
tion of many confusing federal re-
quirements applying to the nation's

argued Thomas Sowell, an
economics- professor at the Univer-
sity of California, in a paper
presented before a federal civil
rights consultation in Washington,
September, 1975.

“The historic informal balance:

of power is being shifted away from
those with specific expertise in their
fields to those who feel outside
pressures to generate either accep-
table numbers or acceptable pro-
cedures, excuses, .or promises,”
Sowell wrote. -

But perhaps the most confusing
and controversial part to come out
of the federal laws requiring affir-
mative action ‘is the concept of
“goals and timetables}?

Revised Order Number 4 further
requires the contractor to determine
whether women and minorities are

. develop as a part of its affirmative

action program specific “goals and

that underutilization.

But the definition of a goal or a

New Management Takes

 

 

Over Towers cafeterias r 

By GLENN FREUND

Pitt News Staff Writer _ ‘
As of June 1, food service opera-

tion for the two residence hall
cafeterias has taken the name
“daka” (Dining and Kitchen
Administration, Inc.), replacing
Key Service, Inc., which has handl-
ed the job for the last five years, ac-
cording. to Auxiliary Services
Business Manager James Beavers.

The cafeteria management staff
and other personnel will stay on
under. “daka,” said Beavers.

The change of food service com-
panies for the Towers and Lothrop
Hall dining facilities leaves a bitter
aftertaste from the fall when a peti-
tion was circulated demanding a
more palatable offering, along with
hundreds of other complaints,
mostly involving deboned fish, and
a few complaints of foreign objects
in the food. '

A full scale search by the Student
Food Service Committee led to its
recommendation of “daka” which

-was eventually approved by

‘cafeteria management.

Beavers heard of two complaints

involving chipped glass in

someone’s ﬁsh and a hard granule 

in "a celery strip but stressed ‘that
such cases are unavoidable and
rare. He said that menu monotony
was the main cause of dissatisfac-
tion, saying, “If you had to eat,in
the same place day after day the
boredom would get to be a bitch.”

Beavers denied, however, that '

student pressure was the main
reason for the change.

“It was a combination of com-
plaints and the fact that bids hadn’t v

been sent out in five years to food

service companies,” he said, adding a

that “complaints were connected.”

Beavers said that the fall petition __ ’_ I

plaints.

Night Times Resumes July Pub

By DAVID GUNDERSON‘

_Pitt News _Staff Writer
The Night Times Wlll resume

publication in the first week of Ju-
ly, according to Cathy Miller, its
new editor.

The Night Times will be con-
sidered an “official” publication of
the College of General Studies
(CGS) Student Cabinet, but Miller
sees the change as strengthening the
paper’s role in serving its reader-
ship, who consist largely of night
and part-time students. She sees the
role of the paper as giving students
attending CGS something they can-
not get in The Pitt News—a sense of
community.

Miller added that the publication
can be an opportunity for CGS
students to gain experience with
news writing and editing.

The Night Times suspended
publication in February following

the resignation of its editor William
Means, and lack of funds for fur-
ther issues. A review committee
established the new functions of the
paper and appointed Miller editor
earlier this month. The paper will
be published on a monthly basis,
and will be mailed to 7,000
students. Copies will also be
distributed on campus.

The paper’s new format will con-
centrate on local news, as well as in-
formation of particular use to CGS
students. According to Miller,
“evening students are really under-
represented” in publications, and
she hopes to get more of them in-
volved through the Night Times.

Miller, a CGS student herself,
has a long-standing interest in the
areas of news writing and editing.
She is a former editor of Pitt’s

literary magazine, Backspace, and
she works with the University of
Pittsburgh Press. Her past exper-
ience has included work with the
American Philosophical Quarterly,
the New Sun and Pittsburgh East.

The Night Times will begin
holding Monday staff meetings on
June 9th, and is in the process of
recruiting staff members. All
students, whether CGS or not, are
welcome, Miller said.

Bowen Gives Housing Director _
lob Of Evaluating Student Services

  By CLARE GLEASON

pm News Staff W_riter
Alden E. Bowen, director of the

Office of Special Student Services
(OSSS), has charged the coor-
dinator of universities’, off campus
housing (OCHO), with the respon-
sibility of conducting a “self study”
of each of the five components of
OSSS.

The main objectives of the
evaluation program are to “save
time and money,” according to
Mary Lou Sosso, director of
OCHO. Ultimately she intends to
provide each department with a
“procedure manual that will define
jobs, forms, and serve as a training
program.”

Sosso will submit a report to
Bowen after compiling the results
of her data.

“I’ll make decisions on how to

I better manage the resources and

personnel of the offices,” Bowen
said.

The five components are: Off-
Campus Housing (OCHO), New
Student Programs, University Stu-
dent Judicial System, Disabled Stu-
dent Services, and Veterans Ser-
vices. ' ,

Bowen assigned Sosso the study
because “I think she has a sense of
organization. She has the time and
interest,” he said.

Sosso has been a university‘

employee for 11 years, and was
previously employed by the Office
of Student Accounts.

'“My job was no longer challeng-
in‘g so I applied for a transfer,” she
said.

She was then hired as coordinator
of off-campus housing in
September of 1975, when the office
was located in the Student Loans
and Special Accounts office on

“I was given the freedom to
develop the office,” Sasso said. She
did intensive research of colleges
with comparable populations
regarding the off-campus housing
facilities they employed.

“In its first year, the office in-
creased. its number of landlords
from 700 to 1,500 and its student
clientele from 8,000 to 14,000,” ac-
cording to Sosso. ' ‘

“I felt we were not serving the
amount of students we could if we
had more space,” she said. She
submitted a requisition to the Of-
fice of Space and Management to
locate a facility that could accom-
modate OCHO’s expanding
clientele.

On April 1, 1978, the office was
relocated to the Schenley Hall Pine
Room. .

OCHO provides students and
faculty of Pitt and CMU with
listings of apartments in the sur-
rounding areas, a roommate mat-
ching -program, a complaint file
outlining speciﬁc encounters with
landlords, Pittsburgh area -maps,
lists outlining average housing
costs, the dos and don’ts of leasing,
and a low rate insurance program
designed especially for students.

“Mary Lou should get 100 per-
cent of the credit for the fact that
we have an office that provides
“students with an excellent service,
one good enough that another
university (CMU) pays us to have
access to it,” Bowen said.

Sosso implemented a listing fee‘
for landlords in September of 1978.

“At a time when the university’s
budget is declining, Mary Lou has
managed to continue to provide
quality services by generating in-
come,” Bowen said. Presently,

OCHO serves 20,000 individuals
and 2,000 landlords.‘“"*'

Recently, Bowen‘ directed Sosso
to undertake and coordinate ser-
vices for commuters. Sosso drafted
a proposal outlining the need for an
Office of Commuter Services which
Sosso views as “the catalyst for in-
volving commuter students in social
programs and activities.” '

“That undertaking is presently
being reviewed in relation to the
Commuter Affairs Committee of
the Student Government Board and
the Office of Student Activities,”
Bowen said. The intention of the
proposal would be to see that com-
muters needs are best served, accor-
ding to Bowen.

OCHO was instrumental in
facilitating The Magic Bus, the
commuter publication, with Sosso’s
encouragement, and OCHO’s

‘ budget.

Sosso sees the OCHO system as
running efficiently enough where
development is at a level that allows
her to ‘pursue other challenges such
as the re-evaluation of OSSS and
the commuter services proposal.

“My office works for me,” Sosso
said, and in an estimated‘ three or
four months, she proposes to
reorganize OSSS with OCHO’s effi-
giggcy.

“Miami I believe is just a spark,”
she said. “Situations in our com-

city expects Pittsburgh to get

Pitts also sees black unemploy-

by all urban cities along with police
brutality.

country today” could revolt, Pitts
said. He referred to police brutality
in this city as being “kept quiet”

blem. He said, “everycity has a
concentration of power in the hands
of a small amount of elected and

to the burning fire. The white com-
munity does not want to share. The

“As it continues its going to be

added. .

. (Continued from page I) -

In the “Higher Education
Guidelines for Executive order
11246” published by the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
‘Welfare, goals are deﬁned as “pro-
jected levels of achievement
resulting from an analysis by the
contractor of its deficiencies, and of

_ what it can reasonably do to remedy

them, given the availability of
qualified minorities and women and
the expected turnover in its work
force.” -

The Office for Civil Rights em-
phasizes that goals are not quotas
which “are neither required nor
permitted by the Executive Order
01246).”

But the amount of interpretations
to federal laws are almost propor-
tional to the number of existing
laws.

“It may be that a given policy will
result in a quota system without its
being called a quota system. This is
precisely what has happened in
affirmative action programming,”
said George Roche, president of
Hillsdale College in a testimony
before the Civil Rights Commission -

, consultation in 1975.

College and university ad-
ministrators faced with developing
affirmative action programs have
“badly confused,” Roche
said.

“ ‘Goals’ and ‘guidelines’ have
proven to be nothing more than
confusing synonyms for numerical
quotas,” the university president
argued. “Those schools attempting
to comply with affirmative action ‘
programming find themselves trap-
ped in a mass of paperwork, a
labyrinth of guidelines, and a con-
flicting collection of definitions of ,
‘good faith,’ ‘equality,’ ‘minori-
ties,’ ‘goals,’ and ‘quotas.’ ”

According to Roche, reverse
discrimination has been the “direct
and inevitable result” of quotas,
goals, guidelines, or “whatever,”
which “enforces” hiring pro-
cedures according to sex or race.

S“P|'eme Court Rulings

Unfortunately for Roche, he
could only substantiate his claims
of reverse discrimination by an
earlier case which the Supreme

Court had sidestepped on.

The Supreme Court, divided 5 to
4, refused on April 23, 1974, to
decide whether medical, law, or

.;a;;;’n.;.. 9:.  

Affirmative

other professional schools can con-
stitutionally give preference in ad-
missions to members of minority
groups at the expense of qualified
white applicants.

The Court tabled the case, a ma-
jority declaring that Marco DeFunis
Jr. “is now entitled to complete his
legal studies at the University of
Washington and to receive his
degree from that institution.”

The suit was brought by DeFunis
against University of Washington
President Charles Odegard in 1971
after the University’s refusal to ad-
Amit him.

DeFunis claimed that three dozen

minority applicants with Law

School Admissions Test scores and
academic ratings lower than his had
been admitted. ’

But the issue of reverse
discrimination—providing special
treatment in education and employ-
ment to racial minorities over
meritorious achievement by whites-
—was put off indefinitely by the

- Court. The case was declared moot

in 1973, leaving the basic issue
unresolved.

The Bakke Case

That issue remained unresolved
and untouched, until October of
1977, when the Supreme Court was
faced with what Time magazine
called “the most important civil
rights case in a generation.”

It was called the “Bakke case,”
but when it went before the
Supreme Court it was titled Regents
of the University of California v.
Allan Bakke.

Allan Bakke of Sunnyvale,
Calif.‘, an engineer, father of two,
and Vietnam veteran, applied to a
dozen medical schools in 1973 at the
age of 33, but was turned down. by
all of them.

However, the rejection which irk-
ed Bakke the most came from the
University of California at Davis.
At its establishment in 1968, the
medical school was critically under-
represented by minorities, enrolling
only two blacks and one Mexican-
American in the first two entering
classes.

So with the realization that the
school had the chance of being at-
tacked as discriminatory, the facul-
ty put into effect a program for “in-
dividuals from disadvantaged

economic backgrounds,” and 16 of
100 slots were reserved for them in
each class.

The university admitted that
Bakke was just as qualiﬁed if not
more qualified than the minority
applicants, and his record was even
better than the minority students
who had been currently enrolled,
but Bakke was still not accepted.

When Bakke brought the case
before the California Supreme
Court, he was upheld in a 6-to-l

opinion with the ‘ruling that his 14th-

Amendment
violated. _

However, the University of Cali-
fornia appealed the decision and the

rights had been

The Court's decision was
somewhat ambiguous. With a ﬁve
to four majority, finding the affir-
mative action program of the
medical school at the University of
California to be.illegal, the Court
ordered that Bakke be admitted.

However, since no one opinion in
the 1978 Bakke decision was
representative of the Court as a
whole, the legal boundaries and
limits of affirmative action pro-
grams remained uncertain.

There have been more current

testing the legality and extents of af-
firmative action programs, none of
which have as yet given a concrete
answer to the subjectivity of the

interpretation of the federal laws
and guidelines.

.Walker Amendment

So in 1978, with the sponsorship

of freshman Rep. Robert Walker‘

(R-Pa.), an amendment was added

to the 1978 appropriations bill for .

the Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare (HEW). - The
amendment would have prohibited
HEW from requiring quotas or
anything related to them in hiring,
employment, or admissions prac-
tices in institutions of higher learn-
mg.

Action Withstands Criticisms, Suprerlne Court

There was heated debate over
the amendment in the House, and
Walker was charged with thwarting
the efforts of over two decades of
civil rights legislation. The amend-
ment passed through the House on
a voice vote, but was defeated by a
64-31 vote in the Senate. When the
House-Senate conference commit-
tee met to conciliate their dif-
ferences, the amendment was
destined for defeat.

“When the question came up for
discussion, there was none, and no
vote. It was all over with a simple,
‘The House recedes.’ That was
all,” wrote John R. Cranford,
Washington correspondent for the
Affirmative Association of America
in an August, 1977 newsletter.

TheFuture of
Affirmative Action

The persistence of complex ‘ques-
tions arising out of the affirmative
action legislation seems
endless—at least for the time being.
But one thing is for sure: affirma-
tive action programs will remain on
the campus, and in private industry
for as long as discrimination exists
at these levels. But the past effects
of discrimination will never be heal-
ed, etched in the minds of those
who were not witness to the civil
rights efforts of concerned and
thoughtful individuals and
organizations.

Statistics Show Decrease In Coal Use

Wednesday, ‘June 4,* 19.80¥-Page 7 :

Fourm Highlights CoaI_As Alternative Energy Source

By CONNIE McCLAIN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Coalias an energy resource was
the topic of a lecture-luncheon
sponsored by an organization
specializing in energy-related sub-
jects. V

Sponsored by the Institute of
Technology and Society, Inc., the
seminar was held on Saturday in
Forbes Quadrangle.

“Coal has always been on the
backburners as far as research,”
said Phillip Anderson, director of
operations for the organization.
‘.‘No emphasis has been placed on
coal research. ’ ’

“Coal alone could fuel all of the
U.S. energy demand,” Anderson
said.

TERRIFI

Between 1971 and 1978, the
amount of electricity produced
from coal has decreased 2.8 per-

cent, while the use of other sources’

of energy such as oil and nuclear
power has increased. '

America produced 44.3 percent
of its electricity from coal in 1971,
while in 1978, only 41.5 percent of
its electricity was being produced
from coal.

“Coal has been phased out in
favor of gas and oil,” Anderson
said.

The Institute is encouraging the
education of control technologists
and coal scientists, according to
Anderson.

“The gap” of untrained coal
specialists should be filled with

trained personnel, Anderson said.

The United States used _80.4
quads of coal in 1979. One quad is
equal to 182 million barrels of oil,
or 25 nuclear power plants.

Coal reserves should last for 924
years at the present usage, but there
is a five percent growth rate per
year according to Anderson. At
this growth rate, in 30 years, 900
years of coal reserves will be used
up, Anderson said.

The United States has 8.1 years
of natural gas reserves and 200
quads of oil reserves left, Anderson
said.

The United States imports 90

billion dollars of oil a year, Ander-

son said.
“In ten years, the OPEC com-

 

panies could buy every outstanding
corporate stock in the U.S.”

Another project the Institute is
planning is an aluminum can recycl-
ing project. Contracts will be mail-
ed to offices, education facilities,
and buildings which have dispensers
containing aluminum cans. Heavy
industrial liners will be placed at the

sites for aluminum can disposal‘.
The Institute would like to expand
the project to include a weekly
public pickup of cans and even-
tually expand it to include the tri-
state area, Anderson said.

The Institute would like to hold
one seminar a month so as to “pro-
file a problem before the public,”
according to Anderson.
