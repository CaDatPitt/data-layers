Occupy Pittsburgh no longer occupying

By Pat McAteer
For The Pitt News

Amid a village of mud—covered
tents, broken furniture and wooden
sidewalk lived a group of people
bound by a single message.

On Wednesday night,‘ that mes-
sage was silenced — if only tem-
porarily.

Two days after the Monday
eviction deadline issued by the
Allegheny County Court of Com-
mon Pleas that ordered the group
to clear offBNY Mellon’s property,
Occupy Pittsburgh peacefully left
their encampment on Mellon Green
Downtown.

About 30 remaining Occupiers
and their supporters held a rally at
Mellon Green to mark their move

 

out. The rally was followed by a
ﬁnal march through downtown
Pittsburgh —- leaving the tents
behind.

The Occupy Pittsburgh move-
ment, which began on Oct. 15,
formed as a branch of Occupy Wall
Street in protest of a multitude of is-
sues,‘including corporate greed and
an economic system in the United

* States that members of the move-”"

ment feel perpetuates inequality.
As members of the press con-
verged on the group’s dilapidated
settlement, members of the Oc-
cupy movement reﬂected on their
experiences. .
Don. Carpenter, a member of
the movement who’s been involved

since the original march, vowed

during the press conference that
the group’s message would live

on. _
A “When the mob and the press
and the whole world tell you to
move, it’s your job to plant yourself
like. a tree beside the river of life
and say, ‘No, you move,”’ Carpenter
said, quoting author Mark Twain. ‘
- Carpenter also reiterated the
national message of the Occupy
movement, and said that the group’s
members assembled to iresistland
abolish the “political, social and

economic” injustices faced by the W

community. '
After Carpenter’s speech, other

members of the Occupy movement .

gave their own testimonials. Some
of the members chose to express
their support of the movement
through poetry. Others chose to
rally the members using battle cries
of the movement.

While members of the press
surveyed the Occupy camp, lead-
ers of the movement yelled, “Out
of the camp, into the streets,” and
the protesters flooded onto~Grant
Street, blocking of the path for
motorists.

Continuing down the street,
leaders of the movement chimed
in with the rally cry of the nation-
wide Occupy movement, shouting,
“We are the 99 percent,” as angry
motorists relentlessly honked at
the group. -

After the marchers turned onto‘ ,

Boulevard of the Allies, city police
vehicles surrounded the group,
ordering members to stay on the
sidewalks. At the beginning, some
members deﬁantly remained in the

University
endowment  
increases by  
25pereent  

By Pat McAteer»
For The-Pitt News

Despite signiﬁcant endowment
growth at the University over the
past year, Pitt students shouldn’t
expect any decreases in their tu-
ition payments next fall. '
In 2011, Pitt saw its endowment
increase by 25 percent to $2.53 bil-
lion, up from $2.03 billion in 2010.

The endowment growth reﬂected a ~

trend in the region, as Duquesne,
Carnegie Mellon, Chatham and
Robert Morris universities all
also rebounded from the recent
recession. , T ,

Pitt’s endowment consists of
all donations‘ made to the Univer-
sity for a speciﬁc cause — such as
founding scholarships or fellow-
ships — based on the wishes of
the donor.

University spokesmanjohn Fe-
dele said that people often mistake
endowment growth for an increase
in the University’s “general sav-
ings account,” when in reality, a
vast majority of donations have
restrictions placed on them based
on the donors’ intents.

“The donated money goes into
a bank account or is invested in
stocks,” Fedele said. “The princi-
pal doesn’t get touched, and usu-
ally a portion of the earnings are
donated and spent on the donor’s
wishes.”

No new shrubbery will plant its
roots on Pitt’s roofs —— at least
for now.

While neighboring Carnegie
Mellon University’s greenery
spans 41,515 square feet across
six buildings, Pitt measures in at
20,100 square feet of green roof-
ing on two buildings. And that

square footage will not change‘

with the construction of the new
dorm on the corner of University
Place and Fifth Avenue.

Daniel Marcinko, a senior
administrator in Pitt’s Facili-
ties Management Division, said
the University’ originally had ‘a
green roof — a roof with a layer
of green vegetation growing on it
e planned for the new dorm, but
the idea has since been scrapped
for “budget purposes.”

Christin Whitco, the senior
project manager in planning, de-

  
   

sign and management for the new
dorm, echoed this rationale and
said that a green roof would not

i make “economic sense!’

“The payback on a green roof
just isn’t there,” Whitco said about
the scrapping of the possible
planting.

Student Government Board
member Gordon Louderback
campaigned on the initiative of
bringing more green roofs to Pitt’s

‘ campus. He rationalized the Uni-

versity’s decision to cut the roof
out of the project.

“It is completely understand-
able given the budget [the Univer-
sity] is dealing with,” Louderback
said. “You can’t take the walls off,
but you can take the green roof
off ... The building can survive
without it.”

Louderback said he is still try-
ing to gain ground with his green

roof initiative, and he hopes to '
speak with University personnel_

this week. ,
. The Board member said that
CMU sets a good benchmark for

the progress of Pitt’s sustainable
projectszswhereas Pitt currently
has two green roofs —-— on the
Mascaro Center for Sustainable
Innovation (8,200 square feet)
and on the Falk School (11,900
square feet) -— Carnegie Mellon
has six.

“CMU is one ofthe leaders of T

sustainability. [It is] a good uni-
versity to base our work off of,”

Louderback said. “ [Adding green .

roofs] can only do good things for
the University  We will look a lot
better when compared with these
other schools.”

Barb Kviz, the environmental
coordinator for CMU, said that

green roofs cover Hamerschlag

Hall, Mellon Institute, Porter Hall,

_ the Posner Center, the Gates Cen-

ter and Doherty Hall.

A Kviz said the ﬁrst green roof, on
Hamerschlag Hall, was intended
as a demonstration of stormwa-

ter management. The vegetation ”

on the roof helps slow the ﬂow
of water from precipitation and
direct it to a storage tank for later

use intutilities, such as toilets or
irrigation systems.

“When youare building a new
building, you should consider
[stormwater management] ,” she

said. “For a new building, it can-be
- built right into the design.” A

Laura Zullo, senior manager of
energy initiatives at Pitt, said in

an email that the University does _

not collect or reuse any rainwater
from Pitt’s green roofs.

Besides collecting rainwater,
Louderback said that green roofs
insulate buildings from their tops

V and reduce the “heat island effect”

—- a term used to -describe how

‘urban areas become hotter _th_an

suburban areas because of a lack
of reflective surfaces, such as those
provided by vegetation.

Whitco said that green roofs
are also supposed to be aestheti-
cally pleasing to students and
visitors. ' '

“When we can, we try to put.

green roofs in where they make
sense,” she said. “We consider

,[a green roof] on every project.

 

‘No plans for expanding square footage of Pitt’s. green roofs

When it makes sense, we do it.
When it doesn’t, we don’t.”
Green roofs consist of a layer

V of waterprooﬁng fabric under-

neath a drainage retainer system
that holds water after a rainfall
so ‘plants’ roots do not dry out. A
ﬁlter fabric is added between the
installed soil and plants to stop

them from seeping into the drain— '

age system. _ A .
Bruce Gaines, the regional
manager for RAM Construction
Services‘, the company that wa-
terproofed the Mascaro Center’s

‘ green roof, said that he could not

provide a total cost for a green
roof. He said that the cost is. de-
pendent on many variables, such
as the size of the roof, what is un-

’ der the roof, the soil composition

and the plants selected.

“.[Green roofs are] good for the
"environment as long as you main-
tain the plants.  It is a lifetime
investment,” Gaines said. '

“[But] they are expensive, and
it’s hard for owners to swallow the
cost.” I A

Fedele said in an email that an example of
this is a $1 million donation from the David
Berg Foundation of New York to endow the

ate School of Business.

. Pitt uses a formula that expends a certain
amount of earnings based on a two— to three-
year average, Fedele said. He added that Pitt
uses this formula to ensure that even during
years when investment returns are low, the
University can count on having a deﬁnite
dollar amount for the budget.

Fowler also said that Chatham sought
new donations in order to fund the build-
ing of a new campus in Pine Township to
add to its current location in Sha/dyside.
He said that the new campus would serve
as the university’s center of sustainability,
where students would be able to earn gradu-
ate degrees related to the environment and
sustainability. Fowler said the campus would
be funded as a “capitaljproject,” through
which the university seeks funding for a

(lur sweet tooth - regulatdrydilemma  

By Matt Schaff
Columnist

The whole idea of government is to nosy it up in
people’s affairs. Usually, the controversy is- about
what affairs and how nosy. Today, it’s about sugar.
In the February edition of the esteemed science
journal Nature, agroup of California ‘researchers
advocated for aggressive government intervention
in the food market, particularly when it comes to a
special ingredient: sugar. Drawing from a variety of
studies that suggest a causal link between the re-

. cent ascendancy of fructose-laden processed food

and rising rates of obesity and metabolic disease,
both of which cost the United States huge sums
each year, the authors. propose making sugary
foods less accessible, either by way of substantial
taxes or physical relocation (i.e., taking soft drinks
out of schools).

Cases don’t often close that quickly, and the.

sugar regulation question is no different. That’s
because not everyone is in lock-step agreement —
as if on cue, industry groups are already starting to
shake their heads. Whichever side wins, a decision
will have to be made some day. Surely, if the authors’
lines of causality between fructose and obesity are
valid, there’s reason to build a society that dances

’ fewer deliciously lethal calories in front of consum-

ers. But even still, implementing the proposed're—
forms — which, by the way, have been suggested
before —— would place the U.S. government in an
unprecedented place, and I believe such a decision
should come only after a careful evaluation of how
far we want to engineer our fellow Americans’ in-
gestive behaviors.

Although they would never frame it this way
for fear of losing an election, public executives and
lawmakers go to work in the morning to pursue
one common, goal: behavioral engineering. Now
that might strike you as Stalinistic and therefore
inapplicable to the American model, but you’d only
be half right —— the first half. By deﬁnition, whom-

ever fate happens to place in a governing position

— be it a dictator or the denizens themselves —'
commands control over the inﬁnite set of possible
human behaviors, as the ruling body can encour-
age certain behaviors and discourage others. The
alternative, which one could call the ideal “free

9

market,‘ is no different than chaos.

Whereas physically intact people over the age

of 10 are capablegof pressing apedal and turning

a wheel and cars are capable of traveling at any _

speed up to 120 miles per hour, governments nev-
erthéless encourage driving with a license and dis-
courage reckless speeding, each producing visible

results in human behavior. So whenever you see ‘

governments raising local property tax revenue to
pay teachers, pushing money toward pet projects

1 or implementing health care reform, they’re do-
ing it because they have an_ idea as to how people '

in society should behave. And such societal ideals,

‘when they’re turned into laws and then followed,

have consequences on what we do. .

One of the things-we do regularly is put stuff in
our bodies. As anyone who survived the D.A.R.E.
program can attest, these “input” behaviors (which
include ingestion, inhalation and injection) have in
recent history been subject to rigorous govemmen—
tal engineering. This area of control, in particular,
engenders ubiquitous, heartfelt disagreement.
From disgruntled Pittsburgh smokers struggling to
enjoy bar—going to party—frenzied freshmen decry-
ing the drinking age to a misguided Michele Bach- ’
mann blaming required newborn immunizations
for autism, regulation of input behaviors ruffles
feathers far and wide. I ‘

It’s the government-ledengineering of sugar-
eating habits that I believe could lead to even more
of a stir. Sure, sugar might share a lot of the risks
that qualify tobacco and alcohol for regulation —
a potential for abuse, toxicity in certain quanti-
ties and a negative impact on society. But there’s
a crucial difference. Sugar, in. some quantity,isS a

— nutrient; eating it can literally add something con-

LETTER To THE soiron
To the Editor, W l

I was pleased to see that the night af-
ter Gov. Tom Corbett announced his state
budget proposal, The Pitt News had all the
information about the proposal covered
on the front page as well as in the edito-
rial. While the facts are helpful, I think it
is important that students know what they
can do to help in a political situation such
as this one. Students should know that the
Pitt Day in Harrisburg event is coming up

on March 13. This event allows students to -

gather in the Rotunda in Harrisburg and
have their voices heard by representatives

through speeches as well as personal inter~
actions. The event lasts all day and trans‘-
portation is provided as long as the student
signs up online (http://pittday2012.event-
brite.com). I think it is vital that students
understand what Gov. Corbett is planning
to do with higher education, and I hope to
continue to see articles and editorials such
as the ones published on Wednesday.

Sincerely,

structive to the body. Smoking cigarettes or
drinking alcohol will not (unless you want to
venture into a hazy discussion of subjective
effects or deﬁne alcohol exclusively as ‘red

deemed it appropriate for government to

the federal cigarette tax or the Allegheny
County alcohol tax, for twoexamples. But
the idea of selecting items out of the grocery

list forsimilar discouragement threatens to i

take behavioral engineering to an arguably
unsavory level, one that could compromise
a traditionally prized American value: free-
dom of choice. An excise tax might reduce
average sugar consumption to some social
optimum whereby obesity levels are con-
trolled. But at the same time the tax pun-
ishes all sugar consumers, even those who
make good dietary decisions on the whole

‘No doubt, reversingthe obesity epidemic
would quell a lot of American suffering, but
before we sign on to wide-scale government

mhs away! Depthcharges am

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

A “depth charge” might not sound all that:
appetizing, but when this drink combina-
tion is called by its more common name of

“bomb,” it has fans the world over.

The cocktail—like combinations begin
with dropping something small into some-
thing larger. The mixture is then consumed

immediately to ensure the ﬂavors don
mingle 'un—deliciously. ‘ . _

In every case, drink makers should be
sure to use glasses big enough to have a
shot dropped into them without putting

half the drink on the counter. Also, drink- '

ers should keep track of shot glasses, lest a
rogue or forgotten glass chip a tooth.

Here are a few classics to get you start-
ed. Make sure to drink responsibly.

warm sake allows the drink to go down smoothly

Julie Allerton
For The Pitt News

Nick Pratt has said enough about pop-
ping champagne and rolling weed. The
Pitt graduate and rising hip-hop artist’s
new project, Middle Finger Music, reveals
that there is more —— a lot more —-— to
Pratt than the inﬂated and intoxicated
bragging of many of today’s mainstream
rap artists. _

Middle Finger Music is all about Pratt.
With tracks titled, “Perseverance,” and
“Higher,” he has created a project with
the purpose of carrying his career to the
next level; ' ,

Hailing from Fort Worth, Texas, Pratt
employs a southern slang that effects a
smooth and articulate sound. His slow
rhymes showcase what he calls, “lyrical
effervescence,” and this accurate descrip-
tion is a testament to the intelligence

with which Pratt raps + or, as he calls -

it, writes. .

He uses his opening track, “The Cool
is in Session,” to introduce himself, rap-
ping over a jazz vocal sample: “DJ Pre-
mier appeared to me in a dream, he said
a Texas boy can make it in the North if
he believe.”

Throughout the album, in his ﬂuid
drawl, Pratt covers social issues, his inspi-
rations and goals and his spiritual beliefs,
with the thread throughit all being his
blatant confidence.‘Unfortunately, that
self—focus sometimes gets a little repeti-
tive.

The album features laid-back, more
monological tracks as well as bass—heavy
hit—worthy tracks produced by Delaware-

Middle Finger Music
Nick Pratt ‘
Self-released

Rocks like: T.l. with Kanye’
beats _ ’

Grade: B

based Brandon Lee. The slang and snares of
“Feel Good,” featuring Muzikjones Drew,
are slightly reminiscent of Atlant-a’s T.I.
Pratt’s confidence that he will make it
big with his new release is summed up in

this track as he raps‘, “I’m on that watch

list, I’m hot this year, and my team gon’
make it to the top this year.”

Unfortunately, sometimes he gets too
conﬁdent with his lyrical abilities. More
experimental songs like “All My Love”
don’t ﬂow as well because they’re lacking
in musicality.

Though he calls Texas home, Pratt
has strong ties to Pittsburgh, as he has
recently laid his foundation in perform-
ing by opening for now—huge Pittsburgh
artists Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller. Miller
is featured in Pratt’s closing track, “Mac
and Me.”

Alongywith Pratt’s self-proclaimed de-
termination, confidence and lyrical talent,
his break might be due -to his choice of
Pittsburgh for the setting of his debut.
Like those before him, he’s trying to set
the stage for national success. a

'WPTSvCOLUMN‘”_ ‘‘ I 

Local scene in need of good listeners

Stephen Crano
WPTS Contributor

Recently, someone asked me what I think it
takes for a band to succeed in Pittsburgh.
While pondering the question, I had a
realization: Part of success comes on the
band’s part, but in many ways, it’s due sig-
niﬁcantly to the union between music pro-
ducers and consumers. And Pittsburgh mu-
sic consumers have been coming up short
in recent years. Despite that, I don’t think

. it’s too late. In understanding what’s wrong

with the picture, maybe we can ﬁg: it.

There are several deﬁnitions of “suc—
cess” in the local scene: For some, it means
getting a dozen people to come to a show at
some gallery on a weeknight; for others, it
means getting on a national label.

While the latter level of success is difﬁ—
cult to achieve for any band in any city, the
former vision of “making it” can be real-
ized by virtually any group with a couple
guitars, a basement to practice in and an
enthusiasm and passion for playing music.
There is no shortage of opportunities to
play to crowds at bars, open mic nights or
house shows in the ’Burgh, and the dudes
with the guitars and basements capitalize
on the available low—key venues. ’

It should be mentioned that not all of
these bands have the lofty goal of fame and
notoriety beyond theregional level, but that
doesn’t stop them from playing their hearts
out at Howlers or Thunderbird Cafe every
other Weekend. And that is what makes the
music scene so vibrant and attractive to
musicians and listeners alike.

Shows are plentiful, accessible (espe-
cially for the 21+ crowd) and cheap here,
and the demographic that seems.to take
leastadvantage of this is college students.
For a $5 cover, you can go to any number
of bars on a Friday or Saturday night and
see three bands play three different styles
of music. You can hop on a bus and go to a
show at a house or a DIY venue in the East
End or on the South Side.

This leads to another question, related

 as

to the ﬁrst: What does it take to be a suc-
cessful music consumer rather than a mué
sic producer in Pittsburgh?

Like the bands in Pittsburgh, the fans
have to be enthusiastic and listen as hard
as the bands play. One has to make connec-
tions with his fellow audiophiles and scen-
esters to ﬁnd the best house shows and bar
venues. .

Luckily, the music appreciator in this
city has no shortage of resources at his
disposal to help him keep his ﬁnger on the
pulse. The City Paper gives the cut—_and—dry
listings and lowdowns for the shows of the
week. On the web, we have the Roboto—
board and Pittsburgh Indymedia to discuss
shows past, present and future _— among
other things. In addition to on traditional
andnontraditional media sources, fans can
keep up with their favorite local bands on
Facebook, Twitter and Bandcamp.

So, why, with all these shows and re-
sources at the disposal of the music and
culture consumer, are there those who still
level accusations that Pittsburgh’s scene is
on the decline? Why can’t some bands get
a dozen people to come out to their gigs on
Wednesday nights? It is, I believe, because
of irresponsible consumers. The only peo-
ple who want to go to a show on aweeknight
in__Pittsburgh are the dudes in the bands.
The state of the scene is grim, but all is not
lost. Let us bring the music out from under-
ground. Let us savor every drop of melody

we can squeeze from every show we go to. .

Let the bands play to crowds and not empty

ﬂoorspace. Citizens of Pittsburgh,students ‘ in

and music aﬁcionados, I entreat you: There
has been enough standing idly by while
show after show is played and missed. It is
time to take responsibility for the role you

are obliged "to ﬁll: to step up to the task of .

becoming a good listener. This is, I feel, not

too much to expect of the music lovers and a

culture vultures. This is, I know, the change
that must occur for bands to gain success
on any level in Pittsburgh.

‘Safe House’ not safe from plot holesi

Jeff Ihaza
Staff Writer

If “The Bourne Identity” franchise was
successful because it featured a great cast,
a compelling story and a relatively novel
idea, then “Safe House’_’ is unsuccessful
because it lacks all ofthese things.

As much as it seems the latter wanted

to copy the former, the ﬁlmmakers just
'didn’t pull it off. The plot of director Daniel

Espinosa’s movie is wholly unoriginal and

poorly executed, ultimately leaving the

audience to make due with two hours of “I
called it.”. The film stars Ryan Reynolds as
Matt Weston, a young CIA ﬁeld officer who
has been relegated to maintaining one
of the agency’s “safe houses” in the most
boring region for CIA activity, Cape Town,
South Africa. Things change Vquicklyafter
a seemingly endless action sequence in
which roguefCIA-agent Tobin Frost, played
by Denzel Washington, narrowly escapes a
group of spies trying to capture him.
-Frost and Weston are forced to work
together to escape, and along the way
Frost teaches Weston valuable life lessons
:1 laevery movie you can think of. It’s not
so much that the movie is entirely bad, it’s

just tired and cookie—cutter.

One of the more successful aspects of
the ﬁlm is that Washington and Reynolds

make a good team on screen. Washing- 1

ton provides some of his best work as the .
rouge, emotionally unstable Tobin Frost
and Reynolds continues to prove he can
be more than just a funny guy.

As for other commendable features,
certain scenes that take place in cars feel
highly reminiscent of “Training Day,” and
the ﬁght scene's — which account for al-

most the whole movie — are well—crafted
and highly stylized. _ .

Yet the moviebecomes maddening at
certain points, as the characters do things
that simply don’t make any sense. Weston
manages to escape a crowded soccer match
despite the fact that virtually the entire
world is looking for him, replete with news
broadcasters ﬂashing his face across every »
TV screen. Perhaps the biggest plot hole
comes atthe very end, when the writer’s
idea of a twist just makes the preceding
two hours that much more confusing.

Swedish director Espinosa appears
to have done the best that he could have
with the hackneyed screenplay. The cin-
ematography and details in the backdrop
of Cape Town make the ﬁlm enjoyable, if
only for the nice aesthetic. In fact, “Safe
House” is alot like the “Bourne” series in
terms of directing and plot, and that’s just
theproblem. The new release just doesn’t
feel like it’s own ﬁlm so much as a copy of
a more successful movie.   ‘ " ' '

ALBUM REVIEW

Die Antwoord proves it’s serious  

Patrick Wagner
Stajfwri ter

Die Antwoord should be taken seriously.
The group has been riding a wave of

hype-since its YouTube videos exposed ‘

the world to the group’s uniquely South

I African brand of hip-hop in 2009. Al-

though many originally saw frontman
Ninja and group members Yo-Landi

Vi$$er and D] Hi-Tek as something of a '

joke act, they’re anything-but on their
very serious sophomore album, Ten$ion.

From the ﬁrst song, “Never Le Nkemise
1,” there’s a decidedly rave ﬂavor to the
music that harnesses synthesizers over
samples and even verges on the sonic
combustion of dubstep at points.

“I Fink'U Freeky” is infectiously funky
and fun. Vi$$er delivers a monotone hook
over a pumping bass line and decadently
distorted synths. “I think you’re freaky
and I like you a lot” sounds odd, but with
the force of DJ Hi—Tek’s computerized
beats and Ninja’s charismatic rhymes, the
music is kept from becoming too much.

Ninja, on the other hand, is a hurricane

of attitude. On “Hey Sexy,” the emcee’s'

bravado is placed over an ominous eastern
beat as he spits words like a soothsayer.-

“Fokjulle Naaiers,” for example, never
seems to hit the speed and intensity Die
Antwoord is renowned for. An overabun-
dant use of the hook leaves listeners an-
ticipating something that never seems to
arrive. .

Despite these blemishes that keep it
from perfection, Ten$ion is altestament

West Virginia University has charged for-
ward with its plans to leave the Big East next
year, but Pitt wants to depart the conference
on good terms.

Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson said
Wednesday that the University wouldn’t pay
more than the required $5 million buyout
to leave the Big East for the Atlantic Coast
Conference. '

Later in the day, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported that Westvirginia is close

agreeing to pay the conference $11 million
to join the Big 12 next season.

In its lawsuit, West Virginia asserts that
it should be released from the Big East’s

conference because the Big East.“failed to

university. 4
The Big East responded to the litigation

The Big East Player of
the Week picked up his third
personal early in the second
half and was immediately

Ashton Gibbs ‘took ‘over at
point guard, and with 15 min-

_ But three consecutive Pitt
turnovers led to six straight
South Florida points. The
run forced Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon to call a timeout
and put Woodall back in the
game.

By ‘Lauren Kirschman

The junior point guard’s
presence wasn’t enough to
stop his team’s turnover
woes, and the Bulls took ad-
vantage. USF raced out to a
14-point lead with eight min-
utes to play.

Pitt trailed by double-dig-
its until Patterson knocked
down a 3—pointer to make
the score 53-45 with 2:49 re-
maining, but the team never
got any closer.

Turnovers and poor‘ shoot-
ing doomed the Panthers (15-
10, 4-8) from the start.

Senior Gibbs went score-
less in the ﬁrst 20 minutes,
missingeach ofhisfour shots.
His teammates didn’t do
much better. Pitt’s top—three
scorers — Gibbs, senior Na-
sir Robinson and junior La-
mar Patterson — could only
manage two points among
them in the ﬁrst half. -

Pitt shot 35 percent from
the ﬁeld and surrendered 11
of its 17 turnovers in the ﬁrst
half.

Sophomore ].J. Moore "did
his best to rally the team,
pacing the Panthers with six

points in the ﬁrst half. As Pitt
trailed by three with 30 sec-
onds before halftime, Moore
drove past his defender and
threw down a dunk. But the
Bulls’ Jawanza Poland buried
a three as the buzzer sounded
to give South Florida (14-10,
7-4) .a 27-23 halftime lead.
Gibbs shot 219 from the
ﬁeld and ﬁnished with four

' points. Woodall led the team

with 11 points and was the
only Panther to reach double
ﬁgures. For the game, Pitt
shot just 34 percent from the
ﬁeld and 25 percent from be-
yond the arc.

Senior Hugh Robertson
of South Florida‘ led all scor-
ers with 18 points. The Bulls
dominated inside, scoring
34 points in the paint and
out—rebounding the Panthers
27-23. -

Pitt’s next game is Sunday
at Seton Hall. The Panthers
will get a shot at redemption
a week later when they wel-
come South Florida to the Pe-

_ tersen Events Center. 8

Panthers set for tough out-of-conf

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The Pitt Panthers will take a break from
their 17 consecutive Eastern Wrestling
League victories for a late—season out—of-
conference matchup with No. 22 Hofstra
on Friday.

The Hofstra Pride lost its ﬁrst dual of
the season to undefeated No. 3 Cornell 22-
12 last Saturday on the road. The defeat
dropped the team to 10-1 in dual meets for
the season.

The No. 9 Panthers, on the other_ hand,
picked up a dominating victory over rival
West Virginia in Morgantown to improve
their record to 12-1 in dual’ meets.

Friday’s matchup between the two
top—25 programs will be the fourth such
meeting on the season for Pitt. The Blue

and Gold’s ﬁnal two meets are against

Edinboro and Penn State, both of which
currently sit in the rankings as well.

Pitt doesn’t plan to approach this
match any differently than it does its EWL
matches, despite how late in the season it
will take place. I '

“I feel we prepare, and should prepare,
the same way each match,_”.senior ‘Tyler
Nauman said. “It is a big match just like a
conference match, and we want to win.”

Fellow senior Ethan Headlee even feels
that the timing of the match gives the
Panthers a break because the season has
prepared them physically and mentally for
the run leading up to the postseason.

“Preparing for the match is about the
same as most other matches,” Headlee
said. “Being later in the season, we don’t
have to pushquite as hard, because we are
all in great shape and.ready to wrestle.”

The match’s most intriguing matchup
will likely come at 125 pounds, where Pitt’s
No. 15 junior Anthony Zanetta will square
off with Hofstra’s No. 14 Steve Bonanno.

Bonanno lost "a close match with
Cornell’s top—5 ranked wrestler in his
team’s last matchup, and he will be looking
to bounce back strong in another difficult
match with the Panthers’ Zanetta. The Pitt
junior looks at the ‘match as a chance to
better himself as a wrestler.

“I think wrestling an opponent who
is higher ranked than me is a great
opportunity for.me to go out there and
give it everything I got with no regrets,”
Zanetta said.

Pitt’s No. 12 Nauman is preparing
himself for Hofstra’s unranked Justin
Accordino. Despite not being ranked,
Accordino is a formidable opponent for
Nauman. Hofstra’s 149—pound wrestler
is fresh off defeating Cornell’s No. 20

this would probably beagood time for everyone
to start solving the problems and making every-

thing work for everybody,” he said.

Still, Pederson said that even in Septem-
ber, when Pitt and Syracuse armounced that
they would join the ACC, he'had hoped that
the schools would be able to leave prior to the
27-month waiting period.

WestV1rginia hasn’t shied awayfrom assert-

1 ing that it will play in the Big 12 next season.

Pederson said Pitt hasn’t considered a similar
stance. ‘ 1

“We haven’thad that kind of discussion
about just leaving regardless,” Pederson said.
“We are going to see what happens here.”

If West Virginia settles with the BigEast
and leaves early for the Big 12 Conference, its
absence could open another hole in Pitt’s foot-
ball schedule. Pitt already has an opening-in its
schedule because Texas Christian University
——whichwas supposed to join the BigEast next
year —- made the decision to leave for the Big
12 and will face no waiting period.

Pederson said Pitt is close to ﬁlling that
opening. ,

“We are working dﬂigently to try to ﬁx that
hole in the schedule, and I hope we’ll be able
to do that shortly,” he said. “If another hole
is created, it really creates a lot of issues. We
have to keep our eyes open and keep monitor-

jngthis.”

If West Virginia leaves for the Big 12, Pitt
would be looking to add a home game to its
schedule,.which would make ﬁnding a replace-
ment more difﬁcult. »

If Pitt ﬁlls the hole in its schedule left by TCU

and then is able to join the ACC next season, .

Pederson said the Panthers new conference

will be prepared to accommodate the schedule _

ramiﬁcations. .

On Wednesday, the Big East armounced that
the University of Memphis-would join the con-
ference for all sports in 2013.‘

. Southern Methodist University, the Univer-
sity of Central Florida and Houstonwillalso join
the Big East for all sports in 2013. Boise State
and San Diego State will join the Big East for

football only in 2013, while Navy will join for

football only in 2015. v

Big East Commissionerjohn Marinatto has
said that he intends to hold Pitt, Syracuse and
West Virginia to their contracts with.the confer-
ence until the summer of 2014, although that
situation could change as soon as tomorrow

i=ooreALL I  

for West Virginia, the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette
reported.

The decision on WVU could have ramiﬁca-
tions for Pitt, and Pederson said the University
is monitoring West Virginia’s situation.

Pederson said that the Big East hasn’t pro-
vided a reason why the schools can’t leave, even
though the conference itselfhas plans to realign
in 2013. He said Pitt hasn’t had conversations
with the Big East about the University possibly
leavingthe conference sooner than the waiting
period dictates.

“Not at this point,” Pederson said. “I’m hop-

, ingwe can get discussions going about how we
move forward. The sooner everyone can get
moving on to their next thing, the better it is

V for everybody.” - .

He added that he doesn’t know if it’s likely
that Pitt will be allowed to join the ACC before
thetend of the waiting period.

“We’re not going to close any doors yet be-
cause we just don’t knowwhat the future holds,”
Pederson said.

However, he said the ACC would be ready to
accommodate Pitt and Syracuse whenever the
two schools can join.

‘,‘They will take us whenever they can get
us and would be ready for us,” he said. “They
haven’t made anyﬁnal decisions until they know
exactly what all is happening starting with this
season.” '

Recently, ACC oﬂicials announced that Pitt
would join the conference’s Coastal Division.
Although the ACC plans to move to a nine-
game football conference schedule once Pitt
and Syracuse join, Pederson said that ifthe two
schools can move next_ season, they will likely
play eight games.

As farasﬁiture football scheduling, Pederson
emphasized the creation of a series with Penn
State — the two schools areset to play in 2016
and 2017 — and plans to maintain the ongoing
series with Notre Dame. He placed no such em-

phasis on the rivalry with West Virginia.

A He said that decision “Wasn’t a reﬂection”
on West Virginia, but rather recognition of the
tradition and history irithe Penn State and Notre
Dame rivalries as well as the commonalties be-
tween the institutions.

Pederson -— who met with ACC officials last
week _to decide scheduling —— said that all the
teams in the conference “are really on the same
page.” He described the ACC as the perfect ﬁt
for Pitt. “Ex/erybody is kind of working toward
the same thing,” he said. “One thing I really
liked  is everybody makes decisions on what’s
best for the ACC. That’s really how a conference
functions the best.” ﬂ
