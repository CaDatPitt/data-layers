Pitt chemistry prof jumps off bridge

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Paul Biloen, ‘a professor of chemi-
cal and petroleum engineering at Pitt,
died Tuesday afternoon at 4:45 when

he fell from Panther Hollow Bridge. '
The death was determined a suicide V

by the county coroner.

Biloen, 47, of 2302 Tilbury St. in
Oakland, is survived by a wife and
two children.

The incident was witnessed by

Robert lrwin of Monroeville. Accord-
ing to the police report filed by Pitts-
burgh Police Officer Puloso, the
victim covered his eyes and threw
himself from the bridge.

Biloen was appointed with tenure
at Pitt on Jan. 1, 1983. Prior to that
time, he worked for Shell Corpora-
tion in Amsterdam where he received
a Ph.D. from the University of Am-
sterdam in 1968. '

S.H. Chiang, chairman of the
chemical and petroleum engineering
department, said Biloen’s classes will

be taken over by James Goodwin.

”He had one of the biggest
research projects in the department,”
Chiang said. He added, ’’I’m not
sure whether his new projects will be
funded since he will no longer be the
principle investigator.”

The two projects in question are-a
study in amino synthesis, funded
through the National Science Foun-
dation and an examination of the be-
havior of water in open hydroxied
layered lattices, commissioned by the
Gas Research Institute.

Scranton says Casey's plan
would lead to budget deficits

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Jean—clad industrial woikers and
college students outnumbered poli-
ticians 2-to—l at Tuesday's Scranton-
Fisher promotion at the William Penn
Hotel.

According to William Scranton ll,
former Pennsylvania governor and
father of the present candidate, the
reason for such a curious amalgama-
tion of supporters for‘the Scranton-
Fisher ticket is due to its widespread
appeal from a stong platform which
concentrates on economic de-
velopment.

”My son's plan is far superior to his
opponent's,” Scranton said. ”Bill
seeks to generate economic growth
through cooperation with counties
and local communities. Casey is tak-
ing a centralized approach.”

Scranton believes Casey's program
would likely’ lead to high budget
deficits.

”We all remember that there was
no money left at the end of the Shapp
administration,” Scranton said. ”The
tax rate in business was so high that
none would consider coming here.
Let's not let that happen again.”

Scranton also assailed Casey for ac-
cusing his son of lacking courage.

”The one thing Bill does not lack
is courage,” Scranton said. ”Seven
years ago, he went into the Three
Mile Island plant in the height of the
crisis. He felt it was his duty as an
elected official to get a first-hand look
at the situation." i

Scranton believes his son has had
much to do with the success of the
Thornburgh administration, particu-
larly in the area of criminal justice.

SPORTS

Fralic used steroids

Former Pitt All-American
lineman, Bill Fralic, says.
he used steroids while
playing at Pitt.

”Bill has attended 82 percent of the
pardon board's meetings,” Scranton
stated. ”As a result, only seven mur-
derers have been pardoned; that's
240 less than the.previous adminis-
tration.”

State Senator Mike Fisher believes
his running mate's impressive past
record will produce a victory at the
polls on Nov. 4. So confident is Fish-
er that he expects to fare well even
in- Democrat-controlled Allegheny
County. —

One of the reasons Fisher believes
he and Scranton will do well in Al-
legheny County is because of the ef-
forts of area Republicans.

”Everyone has done a tremendous
job,” Fisher said. ”Traditionally, Al-
legheny County has been Democrat
country," he added. ”This year,
we're going to turn all this around.”

 

";He was a very well known and
respected researcher of internation-
al reputation,” Goodin said. ”His
work is admired in America, Europe
and Japan.”

Chiang said he wasn't expecting
Biloen’s suicide, but he was aware
that Biloen was depressed.

”Obviously these things don't hap-
pen all of the sudden,” Chiang said.

”He was very sharp technically,”

r Goodin said. ”He was considered

one of the sharpest minds in the
field.”

Pitt    
granted  
research
facility     

By Jack Burkman _.
Staff Writer A .

University officials announce :5
yesterday that the Smithsonian lnsti.-.1.
tute in Rockville, Md., is donating a .
multi—million dollar radiocarbon .dat-:77
ing lab to the University of Pittsburgh[ " 
The lab will. be installed at the Har-
marville Research Center. “

James Adavasio, chairman of Pitt's J
anthropology department, said he is
elated that the university was able to

V make such an acquisition.

”This is one of the foremost radio- 
carbon dating labs in the world,” s‘
Adavasio said. ”The incredible com-'
petence and reputation that the lab i S, 2; AL
has are unparalleled. if

”The new lab will greatly enhance
the university's capacity to do high-’
powered research,” he said. ”All _
scholars who are interested in dating _ J 
objects in the last 70,000 years have_ J. .
reason to turn to radiocarbon 
testing.” -'

Advasio said the acquisition of this '
lab is one of the university adminis-
tration’s greatest achievements of the
past decade. - 

”lt’s the largest intact facility Pitt»
has ever obtained,” he said. ,”lt’s an . .
extreme credit to the administration ‘ .;;,_:-.,
that they managed to capitalize on’ 
this windfall in such short order.”

Adavasio said he believes there are «
two reasons why the Smithsonian ln- _
stitute decided to donate the research .
facility to Pitt. .

”First ofall, our archeological pro-
gram has enormous visability,” he s

. said. ”Secondly, Pitt is one of the few
universities in the country which had
the space to house the lab."

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Saudi
Arabia today dismissed Oil Minister
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani after a
quarter century in office. Analysts
worldwide predicted a temporary oil
‘price decline and realignment in
OPEC’s balance of power.

The official Saudi press agency, in
a terse statement issued before dawn,
gave no reason for Yamani’s dismis-
sal but said he had been replaced by
Planning Minister Hisham Nazer.

Nazer, considered a key minister
in this kingdom of 11 million people,
is thought to have close ties to the
royal family. He was the first Saudi
representative on OPEC’s board of
governors in 1961 and was deputy
oil minister under Yamani for sever-
al years in the 19605.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest
oil exporter. Oil analysts said Yama-
ni’s dismissal could cause a short-
term decline in oil prices because of
uncertainty about the new minister.

In the Netherlands, heating oil
prices on the Rotterdam spot market
fell slightly this morning but recov-
ered by early afternoon to about
$14-$15 per barrel. One analyst, who
spoke on condition of anonymity,
called the early declines an ”emo-
tional, knee-jerk reaction” to the Sau-
di news.

delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark U.S. crude, were
sharply higher. The price of a
44-gallon barrel opened at $13.90
and quickly moved to $14.17, 44
cents above Wednesday's $13-73
close.

Pope tells bishops
to sever ties with
pro-homosexual groups

VATICAN CITY — The Vatican
reiterated today that homosexual acts
are sinful and told Roman Catholic
bishops to mount a strong campaign
to proclaim the church's teaching on
homosexuality. It accused pro-
homosexual groups of engaging in
”deceitful propaganda.”

The Vatican ordered bishops and

priests worldwide to withdraw their
support from organizations which
”seek to undermine the teaching of
the church, which are ambiguous
about it or which neglect it entirely.

”lncreasing numbers of people,
even within the church, are bringing
enormous pressure to bear on the
church to accept the homosexual
condition as though it were not dis-
ordered and to condone homosexu-

al activity,” it said in a 15-page letter
to the bishops.

The letter, dated Oct. 1 and made
public today, was drawn up by the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, the Vatican's watchdog over
doctrinal deviations, and approved
by Pope John Paul II. I

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect
of the congregation, said the letter
was being sent because the con-
troversy involving homosexuality
”even in Catholic circ|es” has be-
come a matter of ’’sufficiently grave
and widespread importance.”

Congress exposes
massive waste

WASHINGTON — A congression-

Crash tapes show
impending doom

WASHINGTON — A Mexican jet-
liner collided with a small plane over
southern California killing 82 people
seconds after the jet’s pilot ended a
brief exchange with an air traffic con-
troller and agreed to maintain his air
speed, according to transcripts of
cockpit conversation released today.

The transcript included large gaps
because of the recording tape’s poor
quality and provided no apparent
clues as to what caused the Aug. 31
collision over Cerritos, Calif.

The recording gave no indication
that the crew of Aeromexico Flight
498 ever saw the single-engine Piper
PA-28 that slammed into the DC-9's
tail section.

Investigators said in releasing the
cockpit voice recording that, while
the cockpit recorder tape sustained
only minor damage in the crash, its
quality was ”extremely poor" and
that other cockpit noises made much
of the conversation among the crew
members unintelligible.

Panel reviews students for
position on board of trustees

By Teresa Candori
Assistant News Editor

As part of the nominating process
of the student member of the board
of trustees, the five candidates for the
position participated in a panel dis-
cussion Tuesday night.

According to Jim Mumma of the
nominating committee, the purpose
of the discussion was to aid the com-
mittee in their selection of the three
nominees from which Governor
Thornburgh will choose the student
trustee.

The five candidates answered ques-
tions from the committee, which con-
sists of Mumma, Andy Bacallao and
Monique Simms of the Student
Government Board, P_olly Stabile of
the College of General Studies Stu-
dent Government, and Chuck Pascal
of the Graduate and Professional Stu-
dent Association.

According to Pascal, the panel dis-
cussion was held in the interest of
”an open and honest election
process, unlike the closed, dishonest
and backroom proceedings in 1983.”

The student member presently
serving on the board of trustees,
Thomas Hajduk, was selected in
1983. Pascal cited Hajduk’s silence
on issues such as divestment and the
five-year plan, and called Hajduk’s
term ”trusteeship at its worst.”

”The students deserve better," Pas-
cal said. ”We need a vocal person,
not a wax statue." -

The candidates from which the
committee will choose ' three
nominees are David Clark, a gradu-
ate student in the mechanical en-
gineering department; Al Freone, a
second-year law student; Luke Kluch-

That member has a
responsibility to make
whatever is the best de-
cision in his or her own
judgement.

-— Cheryl Tomko

‘ko, a student in the Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs;
Karen Fish, a first—year law student,
and Cheryl Tomko, a doctoral can-
didate in the School of Education.

The candidates fielded questions
concerning the role of the student
member of the board,°his or her
responsibility to the students, the role
of the trustees as a whole and
divestment.

Freone, who cited his experience
as a member of the SGB Judicial
Board and chairman of the PPC lec-
ture committee, said he felt that often
the trustees have to take into con-
sideration what is best for the univer-
sity in the long run.

”On the other hand, I would have
to be a competent representative of
the needs of the students right now,”
he said. «

Tomko, however, stressed the fact
that the position is a student member
of the board, not a student represen-
tative.

”That member has a responsibili-

ty to make what is the best decision -

in his or her own judgement,” Tom-
ko said. ’’I do intend to bring to ev-

ery board meeting the concerns of
the students.”

Clark agreed that the member is
not to be a representative of the stu-
dents, but ’’I would have in the back
of my mind my four years as an un-
dergrad.”

Luke Kluchko, a former president
of the SGB, stressed the need for
open lines of communication be-
tween the students and the board of
trustees. ,

”The avenues are there for students
to become more involved in the
decision-making process,” he said.

Fisher also cited a detachment be-
tween the students and the trustees.

’’I hope to help bridge that gap, and
build a network of communication,”
she said.

Each of the candidates spoke of .

special concerns he or she intends to
address if selected for the trustee po-
sition. .

Freone noted the problem of pub-
lic safety. Clark said he is concerned
about teaching assistants who have
trouble speaking English. Kluchko
said he hopes to prove that a student
can be a viable part of the board.
Fisher cited the need to make edu-
cation a priority, and Tomko con-
tended that faculty in the tenure track
need to be examined in terms of their
teaching. ,

The committee will be choosing
the final three candidates, whose
names will be submitted to the gover-
nor, on Monday. The final three will
also be interviewed by university
president Wesley Posvar.

Any students having questions
about the candidates or about the
nominating process are asked to call
the SGB office or any of the members
of the committee.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A man_
was sentenced Thursday to 27
years in prison for putting rat poi-
son in over-the-counter drugs to
make money in the stock market.

Edward Marks had ‘pleaded
guilty Aug. 26 to putting the poi-
son in Contac, Dietac and Teldrin
medications produced by Smith-
Kline Beckman of Philadelphia.

He admitted to anonymously
calling police and news organiza-
tions to tell them of the tamper-
ing, with the intention of making
the price of the company's stock
plunge. - '

”Through your utter disregard
you have had a tremendous im-
pact on consumer confidence in
medicines,” said U.S. District
Judge Patricia Fawsett. ”You and
you alone are responsible for your
actions."

SmithKline $41 million, with only
$25 million of that paid by the
company's insurers.

Because of the size of the
amount, however, she did not ask
for restitution, assessing him in-
stead only the mandatory $450 for
court costs.

Marks, who faced a maximum
54 years in prison, had asked
Fawsett for mercy and _was ”very
disappointed” by the sentence,
said his court-appointed attorney,
Jay Stevens.

”We were hoping for a sen-
tence that was much less,’’ said
Stevens, who had recommended
ﬁve to eight years. He said be-
cause of the guilty plea it would

She said the scheme had cost

for lacing capsules

be very difficult to appeal the
sentence.

Marks, 25, must spend at least
nine years,'or one-third of his sen-
tence, in prison before becoming
eligibile for parole, said Stevens.

FBI agents said Marks, arrested
May 30 in Los Angeles, had
bought potentially profitable stock
options that depended on.a sud-
den drastic drop in the price of the
stock. The scheme failed because
the price did not drop.

He admitted he bought the cap-
sules last March in California,
opened them in his home and

laced them with rat poison. He’ _

said he brought the capsules to
Orlando, where ”within minutes”
he planted them in four stores.

in his written appeal, Stevens
had said Marks is a ”copy-cat tam-

. perer, and not the root of the-

problem.”

Stevens said Marks’ tampering

did not cause death or injuries,
and he asked the judge not to
hold Marks responsible for the the
rash of tamperings that forced the
drug industry to convert from cap-
sules to caplets.

In a report_to Stevens, psy-

. chiatrist Michael Gutman said

Marks has a mental disorder
marked by passive-aggressive be-
havior and narcissistic and anti-
social personality traits.

’’I did not feel this man was a
mean, malevolent or evil person
but was a very immature, smooth-
talking manipulator who could
not exercise self-denial, self-
restraint and self-control,” Gut-
man wrote.

Urban crime is
all too common

.37? Wednesday's Pitt News has been referred to jokingly as the "murder
and crime issue.” We covered two deaths, a fire and a robbery.
Granted, that's not exactly what our staff is accustomed to covering,
and that may be the explanation for the lightness of the discussions
concerning those stories.

When one looks at the reality of the situation, however, the hu-
mor disappears.

Oakland has a crime problem. It always has, but this year seems
to be much worse. There was once a time when murders in Oakland
. _ _ were few and far between. But, within the last two weeks, there have
 been two of them, the last of which occurred directly across the street
3 from South Oakland's famous Station No. 4.

The station was supposed to be moved to Squirrel Hill a month

_ ago, but, thanks to some administration in-fighting, it never happened.
If the crime rate around here is this bad already, just imagine how
much worse it will be when Oakland's police station leaves the neigh-
borhood. If a murder can occur across the street from the Oakland
station now, what's going to happen when it is no longer even there?
Seeing a group of police officers walking-around usually acts as

a deterrent for most criminals. All hell is going to break loose when
that deterrent is no longer present on the streets of South Oakland.

Coming soon: An
f   escorting service

 

_ .J....:.__:...__ .._.._T_____ ._...:_. ..  .. ‘ .’.. _._..‘._-

 

 

3 The current Student Government Board has the reputation of do-
 . ing most of their work on an administrative level and not doing a
jl whole lot for the tangible benefit of students. Well, The Pitt News
3._ would like to be the first student organization to applaud them on
 their recent change in this area. One of the things that ”they’re look-
 ing into" is finally going to come to fruition, and one'of their well-
I meaning plans has actually come off of the drawing board.

' For those of you who don't know, the SGB’s plan to institute an
escort service for students is going to be in effect ”sometime soon."

This proposed escort service is something that's been needed

around here for a long time. Crime rates are by no means slipping,
and it's understandable that students feel unsafe. Who knows if an
I ‘ escort service will cause the crime rate to decline, but it will make
a whole lot of people feel safer when they have to face a six—b|ock
; ' walk through South Oakland at I a.m. .
 The Campus Police have a not-too—well-known escort service al-
, ready. But they're already understaffed, and who wants to take a cam-
 pus cop off his beat just to walk someone home? He could be out
 keeping the rioters under control in the Towers Lobby and in front
 g of the ”O.” So an escort service staffed by students is the only logi-
. cal answer to the problem. The SGB heard the cries of the off-campus
' residents and now are prepared to implement their program as soon
as they get the approval‘ from the Office of Student Affairs.

The board member in charge ofthis project, Rob Ardizzi, said that
this escort service could be used as another work—study program. That
way it would be killing two birds with one stone by increasing the
availability of campus jobs for those who need them and improving
1 security on campus at the same time. The only foreseeable problem
 j with the idea of work—study escorts is that the university has been
5‘ cutting down on the number of work study jobs available and, there-
fore, money may end up becoming a problem for this plan.

Once again, The Pitt News applauds the SGB for their efforts on
this project, and we hope that the Student Affairs Office fine-tunes
and approves this proposal as soon as possible. On behalf of the stu-
dent body, we need and want this service.

Date rape is abhorrent

Absolute garbage! I say to Matt Tol-
bert and his thoughts on date rape.
"Now one could argue that this [fic-
ticious] incident was Amy's fault as
much as the brother's, perhaps even
more so  ” he stated. Absolutely,
positively not! While I agree that Amy
didn't show much common sense, a
lack of sensibility does not ever re-
move the blame from the perpetra-
tor of the crime. That's what rape is,
right? A crime. Imagine, if you will:
a merchant owning a store without
bars in the windows. If a thief broke
a window and robbed him, would
the thief be somehow less guilty be-
cause of the merchant's oversight? Of
course not! He broke the law, regard-
less of the behavior of the merchant.
The same is true of date rape. Any
person who chooses to violate and
degrade another is guilty of rape —
and it doesn't matter what the cir-
cumstances are. The instant one per-
son says ”no,” it becomes rape.

I've heard the arguments that assert
the uncontrollable nature of one’s
”needs” and drives, one’s "inability
to stop” at a given point in time. That
also is trash. Themark of being a
responsible adult is having the matu-
rity to control them. When a person
exhibits a lack of this responsibilty
and, by so doing, hurts -— no,,deva-
states — another human being, that

person should be punished, if for no .

other reason than to keep him from
hurting others.

That is the tragedy of To|bert’s re-
marks. Criminals with no concern for
the welfare of their victims not only
go unpunished but are even exoner-
ated. Their victims, on the other
hand, must continue to pay the price
of the crime they did not commit.

It is certainly commendable of Mr.
Tolbert to address the issue of "date
rape.” I am sure all female students
on campus are delighted to know that
young male Greeks should be "gen-
t|emen." However, and this is a big
however, his determination that a
girl, high school age or otherwise, is
more likely at fault in the case of rape
than the male, is, at the least, appall-
ing. Blaming the female has always
been the standard justification for the
animalistic behavior of males. It ap-
pears Mr. Tolbert is living up to this
standard. Any "lad” who rapes
deserves the scorn, loss of ”great"
jobs and, in addition, some introduc-
tion to the criminal justice system.

Apartheid

It annoys me how a person can
write an editorial and call it an opin-
ion when it is someone else’s opin-
ion. I am writing about G.B.
Patterson's weak ruminations over
the situation in apartheid South Afri-
ca. How many times have we heard
the hypocritical concern-without-
commitment of, "yes, we indirectly
support apartheid by having our
funds there, but economic pressure
won't help the blacks who live
there"? 4

What needs to be known is that no
white industrialist, no G.B. Patterson,
no Ronald Reagan or anyone else

. who opposes divestment because of

its alleged potential to harm the peo-
ple struggling for African liberation,
has these people's well-being at
heart. It's not Patterson's country!
South Africa is an illegitimate settler
colony regime! It does not belong to
non-Africans, .it never did, and it
never will; so anyone who does not
want what the people want and de-
mand for themselves is not a friend
of the cause, but an enemy and a
racist. ’ —

Happy Birthday! 1

I’d like to share an experience I had
on the weekend of the 25th. In addi-
tion to being the bicentennial
homecoming, this also happened to
be the weekend of my birthday. This
might be why I'm in the mood to
write about what happened. A com-
memoration?

I'm a sophomore in CAS, and I
usually go home on weekends. On
this particular weekend, I happened
to be out drinking and talking to a
person from my hometown of White
Oak, [Pa.]. While we were talking, I
realized that my friend didn't know
much about our school. I thought it
would be fun to show him around,
so Iibrought him out to Oakland right
then and there.

Pete was impressed by the Cathe-
dral of Learning; he had never really
looked at it before. I thought he'd en-
joy the view from the 36th floor. Un-
fortunately, as we entered the
Cathedral from the Fifth Avenue side,
we were informed rather strictly by
a campus police officer that the build-
ing was closed to us.

Then as we were walking past the

empty William Pitt Union, three girls
stopped us. They drove here from
Erie and were asking us about things
to do. We asked them what they
wanted to do. They responded that
that they heard that Pitt is a big, city-
type party school and that they want-
ed to party.

I then said, "But aren't all those
parties the same? Alcohol, lying,
dancing, sex — usually in that
order?"

My friend Pete, trying to ignore my
flippant remark, went on to recom-
mend some city-related things: the in-
cline, Mt. Washington, the Point, etc.
When they didn't get too excited
over what he said, I recommended
that they simply head in the direction
of the Towers. After all, we had just
won a game; I was sure that they
would be bound to encounter at least
one group in a festive mood.

My friend and_| then headed back
to White Oak and had a pretty good
time talking about things that need
not be mentioned.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY PITT,

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 31, I986

HowPittstands on South African issues  

Recent actions by the board of
trustees and statements by other seg-
ments of the university community

reflect both a shared view of basic '

goals and an honest disagreement
over the most effective means of op-
posing apaitheid. As we discuss these
issues as an intellectual community,
I want to remind us all of the facts and
of 'our common concerns.

First, it is indisputable that at Pitt

all faculties, students, administrators ~
and trustees hold powerful—consen- Q

sus against the system of government
in South Africa. The university's poli-
cy is to sell stock of companies
represented in South Africa that do
not actively oppose apartheid and
that are not actively working to im-
prove the conditions of black South
Africans. This policy of ’’selective’’

divestment is responsible, reasoned —

and aimed squarely against
apartheid.
Our trustees recently further tight-
ened .our divestment policy, and
directed that we pursue a program for
encouraging American companies to

oppose apartheid not only in the eco-

’Heroes’

A couple of weeks ago, a story ap-
peared here about a 24-year-old man
named Nick who found himself in-
volved in a street drama.

Nick was walking along a busy city V

street when he saw a man grab the
purse of an older woman. The rob-
ber began running, and he ap-
proached Nick. -

All through Nick's life he had i-
magined what he would do in a situ-
ation like that.‘ He had always
envisioned that he would react in the
manner of Gary Cooper or Rambo 4
stepping out of the crowd to tackle
the robber and turn him over to the
police. None of this I-don’t-want-to-
get-involved stuff for Nick.

But when it was happening in real
life, things turned out a little differ-
ently. ”The man was heading right at
me, at full speed,” Nick recalled.
”My mind said ‘tackle,’ but my body
said ‘freeze,’ and I felt the wind‘
generated by his movement as he
swished by me and headed down a
side street.  I could have stopped
the man with no trouble, but I did
not.”

The whole incident made Nick do
some thinking. He realized that he

His work

Q. My husband has a body shop
and wrecking business and it keeps
him busy. He is a hard worker, which
I appreciate, but I don't know how
to feel about my situation. We've
been married three months and he
works late all the time. When he
comes home, we eat and go to bed
and -have sex, and then right away he
gets dressed and goes out to run
wrecks. How do I get him to stay
home with me more —~ without grip-
ing at him?

A. First, you have been married
such a short time I can say congratu-
lations, even if you feel a little like
griping. So soon. Your husband is
really involved in his work, and good
husbands of that kind do tend to
skimp on home time. You are right
not to gripe. You have to get him
used to giving up some of that
productive, competitive work time
without worrying every second he
isn't running wrecks. (That's new to
me. It means towing cars in, right?)

You see, if he isn't out running
wrecks he is sure somebody else is
getting them. I wonder if the other
guy's wife wants him home some-
times, too? They might work out a
deal. But that would be some time in
the future, after you've won him over

nomic but in the political realm. As
conditions in South Africa deteriorate
we feel, at least for now, that Ameri-
can presence on the scene is a
progressive force against apartheid;
if this presence is completely sup-
planted by others, we would lose
beneficial influence.

For example, _the recently an-
nounced withdrawals of IBM and

General Motors from South Africa,

could increase the hold of the white
minority in the workplace, if the
operations of these firms are, in fact,

sold to local white business execu— ‘

tives. On the other hand, those with-
drawals can be perceived as a worthy
anti-apartheid stance:

The opposition to apartheid shared
by all sectors of the campus has, for
some, been transformed into a sin-
cerely held case for ’’total’’ divest-
ment, seen as an advocacy of total
withdrawal for its strong symbolic
value. But our ”se|ective” divestment
standson the same moral ground. It
is noteworthy that under this policy,
Pitt has already sold many millions
of dollars of stock in companies that

have not effectively worked against
apartheid. In fact, Pitt has done more
”real” divestment under these criteria
than 80 percent of the institiutions
around the country that assert a poli-
cy of ”total” divestment.’ None of
those institutions has behaved more
responsibly than we have.

Ironically, the protests aimed
against this anti-apartheid policy at
Pitt have been expressed by some in
terms that are inconsistent with in-
tellectual openness and_ academic ci-
vility. Charges of ”genocide” have
been directed against those of us who
are striving to oppose such crimes.
And the university's policy has been
characterized as support for such
crimes. These accusations are quite
unjust or ill-informed.

It was suggested to me in a meet-
ing recently that the policy of the
university on this matter should be
determined by a referendum and that
we should take a monolithic stand in
the name of the whole i_nstitution.
This would be contradictory to the
.responsibility of the trustees, who
cannot legally pass their fiduciary
responsibility to others. Furthermore,
referenda are not suitable to a univer-
sity. This suggestion is one that re-
vives from the past a sensitively
important issue: For the university to
purport to speak with one voice on
the best means of dealing with any
political matter would override the

concept of free dissent and submerge
shades of opinion. While we all agree
that apartheid is abhorrent, we still
disagree on the means through which
it may best be opposed; in a free
university everyone has the right to
hold and express individual views.

Also, clearly, a university is not a
political government; should the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
legislate for ’’total’’ divestment and
therewith supercede fiduciary duties
of trustees, they would. be behaving

legitimately and the university would '
comply expeditiously. For individu- V A

als among us to advocate this is fair
and reasonable behavior.

Overall, it is my earnest hope that,
in the next phase, the energies being
devoted to dispute aspects of divest-
ment be channeled into cooperative
endeavors to oppose the evil of apart-
heid more directly: through better
education of ourselves, internation-
al communication, academic ex-
changes and socio-economic data
assembly and analysis — activities for
which a university is singularly
equipped.

aren't always the winners in life

probably wasn't the hero he had
once dreamed of being; he realized
that if the same thing were to happen
again, he would probably let the rob-
ber flee again.

Well  your reactions have been

‘interesting. I expectedyou to jump

all over Nick and call him a coward
— and in fact, some of you did that.
But most readers seemed to feel that
although Nick did not end.up a hero,
he did the right thing anyway.

In brief, you thought that the
dangers of stopping a robber on the
street outweighed the benefits of get-
ting the purse back. Many of you
pointed out that this wasn't as if the
woman had been in the midst of be-
ing physically assaulted; then, you
thought, it would have been neces-

I sary to go to her defense. But a man

running toward you with a stolen
purse? You thought Nick had noth-
ing to be ashamed of by instinctive-

_ly avoiding a confrontation. The

robber, you said, might have been
armed with a gun or knife.

One response stuck out.

It was from a 45-year-old man
named Chuck who was walking with
a friend on another city street late one

takes him away fromtheir

more.

, For now, try this. The next time, af-
ter a nice lovemaking session, say to
him, ”Honey, stay with me for 20
minutes. Hold me, hug and caress
me — just 20 m_inutes. I'd love that
so.” Research shows that he may not
know that. He may think if you have

a good orgasm it will hold you at

least until breakfast.

Of course you want him with you
more than 20 minutes, but break him
in gently. Don't say half an hour. It
sounds too long, and he wants to run

those wrecks. If he gets into 20-'

minute come-downs with you, in a
while it will be half an hour, 45
minutes. Then you can say, ”Honey,
we're married. I want a half a day a
week just being with you. You know,
the beach, a movie, just us.”

If you want to suggest dinner with
friends, be sure they are friends he
likes, not friends who get his goat.
Get him into being with you by
degrees. He'll like it when he learns
how. He'll be thinking about a whole
day before he knows it.

man” came running toward them,
weaving in and out between pedes-
trians. A well-dressed young man was
in pursuit, yelling ”Stop him! Stop
him!”

Chuck assumed the fleeing man
was a criminal. Chuck yelled at the
man, ”Stop!” The man cried out,
”Don’t stop me! Don't stop me!” The
pursuer was still screaming, ”Stop

three times a week; now every 70
days.or two weeks is average. What
would get him back in gear?

A. Look, you were away six weeks.

‘ Allow youself to have one low sus-

picion for once in your life. Most
-women would think, ”He’s found
another woman.” My friend, this

only six weeks while you defend the

crouched down and threw a body
block into.the fleeing man. The block
lifted the man onto the hood of a
parked car. The man rolled onto the
street and continued running.
Although Chuck had not stopped him
completely, he had considerably
shortened the distance between the
fleeing man and his pursuer.

A police car was in the area. Chuck

‘ran to the street and pointed the

police officer in the direction of the
fleeing man.

Chuck was feeling pretty "good
about himself. ’’I knew I had the
‘right stuff,’ ” he said. ”I had reacted
bravely and spontaneously, the same
way that John Wayne or Charles
Bronson or Clint Eastwood would
have reacted. I had taken my bite out
of crime. And best of all, my old body
didn't seem any the worse for wear,
and the guy I knocked down didn't
stop to retaliate.”

The story should have ended there.
But it didn't.

Chuck and his friend stopped to do
some window shopping, and in a few
minutes the well-dressed pursuer
came past going the other way.

Chuck asked if he had caught the

Besides the old-time sex, what else
is missing in his behavior? Does he
call as often, take you dancing as he
used to? Something says to me that
he is removing himself from your life

‘in an indecisive way. It may be up

to you to speed things up.

Q. I am 23 and I have never ex-
perienced intercourse. I think men
sense this and that's why they don't
pursue me. It's the same whether I
meet them at work or socially. It
makes me self-conscious, and if a
man is attractive to me I get very
quiet. Are these feelings normal?

_A. It is normal for a shy, self-
conscious person to freeze up when
presented with somebody attractive.

”Standard” may be better than "nor-

mal,” which is not a useful word. I
think your freezing up and casting a
chill around you puts men off more
than any psychic gift warning them
away from a virgin. Virginity shows
less than being silent and discourag-
ing. It will be helpful for you to work
on being more sociable and to for-
get about your sexual status, which,
incidentally, is not as rare as you
think.

seedy—looking fellow.

”No,” the well-dressed man-said,‘
but thanked Chuck for knocking the
man down. .

Chuck was curious. What had the
seedy-looking guy stolen from ‘the
well-dressed guy?

The well-dressed man answered:

”That big-mouthed chicken was ar-
guing with me arﬁlmy buddy in a sa-
loon. I got mad at him, and I just
wanted to beat him up."

As Chuck recalls it:

,”There went my glory. The guy's
answer instantly reduced me from
champ to Chump. I had the ‘right
stuff’ —— but the wrong guy. . I

’’I probably should have punche
the [well-dressed] jerk’s lights out, but
I was too surprised to react before he
was gone from the scene.

’’I would like to publicly apologize

r

to that seedy-‘looking guy for trying _ 

to turn him into a hood ornament
when I should have directed my ef-
forts toward tripping his pursuer.

”Next time things will be’ different.
Living in the city almost certainly
guarantees me a future chance to take
a bite out of crime, and the next time
I will get it right — maybe.”

. O '

You have to be at ease with new
people before you can handle any-
one so terrific that he turns you to jel-
|y.at first meeting. Practice being
around people in social groups .or
service committees at church, or the
Y, or in adult ed classes at the com-
munity college (pick classes with

men in them). Wherever people
share work or an interest, they get on

more easily. Your workplace may be .

an exception to this for some reason.

If your-shyness is extreme, get into '

a therapy group, where everyone has
to talk and where it is understood that
everyonehas some _kind of problem
communicating. Waste no time
learning the give-and-take of group
life, and study being bubbly and reas-
suring, OK? Men need someone
friendly, talkative and companiona-

ble to encourage them. Just as much I

as you do!

Virgins are not all stiff and stand-
offish — some of the biggest flirts are
virgins. And keep in mind the pos-

sibility that some average-seeming.

guy can turn out to be interesting and
fun after you have become friendly
with him. Don't get stuck with the
idea that some awesome male sex
object who makes you get tongue-
tied is the only kind of man you want.

By William Young
Staff Writer

Robert Rosenzweig, president of
the Association of American Univer-
sities, chaired a discussion Wednes-

ay night concerning the increasing
restrictions to the free flow of infor-
mation.

Rosenzweig asserted that the fed-
eral government is increasingly
clamping down on the amount of in-
formation released to the public and
what is contained in that information.

”Wor|d War II," Rosenzweig said,
”introduced scientific secrecy as poli-
cy, and all administrations, with the
partial exception of the ‘Carter ad-
ministration, have furthered this
policy.” .

Accordinggto Rosenzweig, this in-
creasing restriction to the free flow of
information is based on two things:
the preservation of national security,
and profit. Free flow of information
from academia is being limited by the
government and companies that
sponsor research at the universities
that the AAU represents.

”The government,” Rosenzweig

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 3l, I986

Clamping down

Public information harder to attain

said, ”or any government for‘ that
matter, limits information in an effort
to try to protect itself from embarrass-
ment from its policies and personnel.

”The government also alleges na-
tional security as a means to restrict
some information. The university,
then, is forced to prove the govern-
ment wrong, but this isn't very pos-
sible since the institution often has no
knowledge of how the information
relates to national security. And no
one will tell them because it's secret,

‘so they can't prove national security

won't be hurt,” he said.
The government and companies

— that sponsor research are able to re-

strict information due to contracts
that are signed by the university and
the grantee of the research endow-
ment. These contracts often contain
a clause that gives control of releas-
ing research findings to the sponsor,
thus letting the sponsor discern what
it feels is necessary to be released.

Companies that sponsor research
restrict information flow because they
wish to,ana|yze data to. determine
what they feel will be profitable in
order to monopolize on the findings

by patenting them.

Information, according to Rosen-
zweig, is not only restricted to the
public, but also to other research in-
stitutions. This restriction, according
to Rosenzweig, causes a waste of
resources by making universities
compete against each other instead
of working together.

”Constraints to any kind of scien-
tific discussion decrease quality,”
Rosenzweig said. ”Universities work
better with free communication, as
they aren't working at odds to accom-
plish research.”

Other objections to information
flow dealt with the access of foreign
students, particularly members of the
Warsaw Pact nations, to supercom-
puters and meetings at which scien-
tific data was discussed.

”There is no explanation,” said
David Greve, another participant in
the discussion, ”for the exclusion of
foreign students from supercom-
puters or meetings where unclassified
data is to be discussed. Even if the in-
formation is going to be published at
a later date, these students are still de-
nied access to the meetings.”

Portrait of a small American town. Lumber-
ton is the town that "knows how much wood
a woodchuck chucks," or so it claims. Where
blood—red roses animate pure-white picket
fences. The friendly neighborhood fireman
waves to the townspeople as he cruises by
in his red fire engine. A Lumberton resident
waters his backyard with youthful excitement
until he's stung by a bee. He suffers a stroke
right there in his backyard, while his dog
playfully attacks the hose that's shooting
violent bursts of water to the sky. As the
disrespectful dog has his day, the camera
travels to the grass, through the dirt and into
the ground to a noisy cockroach colony,
which violently thrives within the earth. Nor-
man Rockwell's nightmare?

The prologue that leads into andexplains
the story behind B/ue Ve/vet, David Lynch's
new film extravaganza, is quite honestly
startling. However, it's merely a precursor to
the meat of the film. Lynch pervades our
perceptions of the world to show us what's
rea//y in the dirt of America. Here we have
a present day fable, which is not so much
about what you see but, moreover, what you
choose to look at. Curiously, our hero, Jef-
frey (Kyle MacLachlan) lives in a slice of
suburbia known as Vista. David Lynch is our
spiritual medium, a psychic tour guide
through the infested streets of Lumberton.

Overall, B/ue Ve/vet is a revelation. it is a
manifestation of psychopothologicol, socio-
logical and sexual awakening where the

. price of knowledge beats you into a frenzied

sort of submission. Jeffrey travails over the
loss of virginty, both physically and mental-
ly. When Sandy (Laura Dern) tells Jeffrey, ''I
don't know if you're a detective or a
pervert," we don't know either. We're iust
as curious to find out as she is. He answers
with his boyish, albeit kitsch, charm, "That's
for me to know and you to find out." As we
giggle, we're forced to confront the same
question.

B/ue Ve/vet is Jeffrey's investigation of a
world he never knew existed. Home from col-

lege while his dad is in the hospital (the man-

stung by the bee), he discovers a'detached,
ant-covered ear lying in afield. Following his
conscience, he takes it to a police detective
in town who later tells him a "complex" in-
vestigation is underway. Naturally, he's got
some leads and, of course, Jeffrey will be in-
formed of all the details after the case is
closed. The detective's curious daughter,
Sandy, tells Jeffrey about ”this woman who's
name keeps coming up in dad's investiga-
ﬁons/’

Jeffrey, a neo-Nancy Drew hungry with a
clue, begins to spy on Dorothy, played by
Isabella Rossellini (in a demanding perform-
ance unlike anything her mother, lngrid
Bergman, ever played), a chanteuse who
purrs Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet" each
night in a sleazy bar like Astrud Gilberto
possessed. One night, while Jeffrey's hiding
in her closet, she discovers him and forces him
to strip at knifepoint. One of the most bizarre
and erotic scenes unfolds before our eyes as
we discover that Dorothy can not distinguish
between sensuality and violence, and that
Jeffrey can no longer distinguish between his
passion and his fear. He has now entered a
kinky universe where love is brutal and life is
perverse. Dorothy's building, the Deep River
Apartments, will then serve as the place of
Jeffrey's spiritual rebirth. lt is here he will be
immersed in the filthy waters of sin and vio-
laﬁon.

A knock on the door is heard and, as Jef-
frey scrambles into the closet, Dorothy lets
in Frank, played by Dennis Hopper. Frank
uses Dorothy to unleash his psychotic attrac-
tions and pathetic sexuality. His profanity is
vile and vivid as he forces her to submit to
his demented will. She is never to look at him

while he ingests loads of oxygen from a port-
able pack and whines "mommy" as he rapes
her. His climax is more psychological then
sexual and, as such, is revolting. Hopper
literally hurled himself into this role, which is
one of the most frightening in motion picture
history. This is certainly the performance of
his career. His Frank is delivered with such
psychotic abandon and demented anger that
he scares the shit out of you.

Jeffrey is troubled by the new world, yet
he pursues another investigation for
Dorothy's sake. It seems Frank has kidnapped
Dorothy's husband and son, and Jeffrey feels
obligated to help her out. By this point, Jef-
frey and the audience have forgotten the ear
altogether, but Lynch, in his genius for logis-
tics, ties up all these loose ends in a very

 

methodical, if not entirely bizarre, manner.
To explain more would violate the mystery
of B/ue Ve/vet. Jeffrey is plunged into a Hitch-
cockian whodunit where the dark truths of
Stanley Kubrick's A C/oc/<wor/< Orange en-
tangle with the warped mise-en-scene of
John Waters. ”The ear," Jeffrey tells San-
dy, ”is a message." lndeed, this is true; the
ear signals the beginning of his Odyssey. Jef-
frey begins to fathom the world as a naive
hero; complete with the angelic halo of
youth, a Superman's cape and a Clark Kent
hope for humanity, he winds up a hero of ex-
perience with the "golly gee" affability in
tact.

B/ue Ve/vet is a journey through Jeffrey's
conscience. The audience follows the ideals,

Failing to master the
comic possibilities

By Susan Washburn

Watching the play entitled
The Servantof Two Masters
written by Carlo Goldoni is vir-
tually identical to sitting through
an episode of Three's Com-
pany. The script consists of
silliness, slapstick and deception
and, like all comedies, only
works if the timing is perfect. The
Point Park Colle e Theatre Co.
production of he Servant of
Two Masters has its moments,
but occasionally becomes
tedious and predictable.

The complications in the plot
arise when Truffaldino (Julio
Ochoa) attempts to serve two
masters at the same time. His
masters are Florindo (Daniel
Krell), who is searching for his
lover, and Beatrice (Ana
Veronica Munoz), his lover.
Florindo, however, does not
recognize. Beatrice because she
is dressed as a man who was
killed in a sword battle. By do-
ing so, she prevents Florindo
from being accused of that

_man7s murder.

Munoz is mediocre as both

the man and the woman. Her
performance lacks the vigor and
energy that most of the other
cast members’ possess. Krell has
energy and a good sense of tim-
ing. The most energetic charac-
ter is played by Ochoa. His
performance is very lively, and
he also has a good sense of tim-
ing. He does have a tendency
to speak too quickly, thus losing
some potentially hilarious lines.

The cast members who seem
to have the most natural sense
of timing are Michele Myers and
Jack Boslet. They portray the
two young lovers who may be

separated because of a previ—'.

ously planned engagement for
the girl, Clarice. Neither per-
former seems to be pulling for
laughs, and by use of creative
phrasing and facial expressions,
they endear themselves to the

~ audience.

The most disappointing char-
acterization is that of Dr. Lom-
bardi, played by Wayne
Hamilton McCord. At times he
dons the Latin scholar attitude,
but he only uses it when quoting
Latin. The silliness of his speech
and manner could have been
consistently funny if maintained

throughout the play.

The Servant of Two /Vlasters is
a fun, but not necessarily pol-
ished, play. Some of the timing
needs to be perfected, and the

performers who aren't speaking _

shouldn't detract from those
who are. But, all in all, the com-
edy is entertaining, and the Point
Park College Theatre Co. pro-_
vides a nice alternative to old
Three's Company reruns.

Through the /</‘tsc/7 of Americana,

powerful that the world itself is
most vulnerable to its grotesque
corruption. This film is a grand
epic of horror, suspense and
mystery on a reallevel as well
as a fable of erotic passions and
criminal lusts on a surreal level.
Lynch turns the American dream
inside out and shows us what the
carcass of our ideals looks like.
Despite any description, it is
Lynch's most realized, thoughtful
and effective work since
Eraserheaa’.

B/ue Ve/vet is certainly his best
film, making bombastic and tam-
pered efforts such as The
E/ephanf/l/lan_and Dune pale in
comparison.

B/ue Ve/vet stays iust this side
of what we know and tiptoes
occasionally through that which
we don't want to know. It's go—

ing to leave the offended and 

apathetic in the cold, yet it will
invigorate those ”detectives”
and ”perverts” such as myself.‘
This film bombards you with
many memorable scenes that
will leave you breathless and
limber with weakness. For that
sort of film experience alone, it
is worth the price of admission.
B/ue Ve/vet is a tour de force of
kinky passion in search of human
compassion which reveals David
Lynch to be a pied piper of
psychopathological humanity.
His is .a study of life like none
have ever attempted to film. |n-
terestingly, however, oxygen is
a brilliant metaphor employed in
B/ue Ve/vet. This film shows~us
that we breathe the same air;
each of us inhaling and exhaling

songs and stinging guitar will ad-
dress the many contradictions
that mark the art of Richard
Thompson.

Foremost among these con-
tradictions is his lengthy
catalogue of critically revered
but commercially ignored re-
cordings. ln I972, Thompson
parted company with Fairport
Convention, a group of folk/rock
pioneers who have since been
referred to as a British equivalent
of The Band. Since that time,
Thompson has recorded and re-
leased nearly 20 albums, ‘in-
cluding six luminescent
recordings with his ex—wife Lin-
da. But far too few have ever
experienced the aching beauty
of_his Celtic-flavored ballads or
the raw fragments of guitar fury
that shape his distinctive rock ’n'
roll outbursts.

The question remains: ‘How
could a man, who Spin
magazine referredto as ”the
best guitarist in rock,” continue
to labor in such anonymity?
Recently, his songs have been
covered by artists such as John
Cougar lvlelloncamp and Elvis
Costello, and he has jumped
from the independent Carthage
label to Poylgram. Hopefully,
the advantages of a major label

-will introduce Thompson to the
A ears of the pop music masses.

The greatestevidence for his
talents is contained on his sec-
ond Polygram release Daring
Adventures. His lyricism is
pained, but you can feel a great
emotional release through his
bare confessions. As always, his
playing is impeccable. He defies
all laws of guitar soloing.

The typical rock guitar solo
proceeds as follows: sustained,
single notes followed by a flurry
of blistering fingerwork and, fi-
nally, a timely end with a return

‘ to the same sustained single

notes.

Thompson, however, often
begins hard and fast, choking
out staccato figures that are
unpleasant but effectively con-
vey the bitter mood of the song.
Or, he may just as easily accom-

pany a plaintive ballad with a

solo that rolls over his throaty
baritone-like mist on the moors.
Richard Thompson is predictably
unpredictable.

If you have any appreciation
of folk/rock and you've never
heard Richard Thompson play,
don't miss this show. His new
touring band plays with a harder
edge than his past groups, but
the traditional elements remain.

One of the featured players‘

will be accordianist John Kilpat-
rick. The accordian has suddenly

become hip again, but I doubt"

that Thompson is concerned with
matters of fashion. His instrumen-
tation, as well as the quality of
his output, has remained essen-
tially unchanged for nearly 20

. years. He is a great artist who

deserves to be heard.

Hey!

Williams is a cellist who

pulls no strings

By David Zuchowski

Anne lvlartindale Williams is
the principal cellist for the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra and
The first woman to hold the posi-
tion in the orchestra's 90-year
history. On Friday, Nov. 7 at 8
p.m., she will perform Beetho-
ven's trio for clarinet, piano and
cello at Carlow College's
Kresge Theater, 3333 Fifth Ave.
in Oakland as part of The Renais-
sance City Woodwind Qu’inteT's
concert series. | discussed with
Williams her upcoming’ concert
and her life as a musician.

D.Z. — First I'd like to ask you
about The cello. What's your at-
finity for The instrument?

A.M.W. — Well, at age
seven, when l started playing
The cello, you really don't Think

in Those Terms. My mother,’

however, was a cellist, and she
sort of eased me into The instru-
ment. She refused, to Teach me
herself, and lthink it's important
that parents [don't] Teach Their
children. But of course she sat
with me, and we practiced
together. For most of my life I
had The same Teacher, Orlando
Cole of Philadelphia.

D.Z. — In Fellini's Orchestra
Rehearsa/, several members of
The orchestra were asked to Talk
about Their instruments in Terms
of Their personalities, mood and
other characteristics. Could you
describe The cello in These terms?

A.M.W. —- Well, I'm very
thankful that I ended up playing
The cello.,|t’s so much easier
Than playing The violin, which
you have to hold up in The air
and [which] gives you Those
atrocious red marks on your
neck. l also Think that it's The in-
strument played closest to The
body and must really become
one with The performer. This
makes The sound very personal.
It alsohas a similarity  to The
human voice with a large, soulful
range, somewhat on The dark
side.

The same question just last night.
| find the violin, for instance,
quite childlike and naive in that
it is very open with its moods,
expressing ioy or sadness with a
childlike ease. The cello, on the
other hand, is like a violin grown
old and wise with an element of
forboding and power that
demands respect.

A.M.W. — Perhaps. But an

 

/-O

D.Z. — Well, lwas thinking of

I  

important technique of good
musicianship is to be able To
make the cello seem playful and
childlike or to make the violin
seem old and wise. So, I don't

know if l agree with stereotyp-A

ing instruments in that way.

D.Z. -— Do you have a
favorite cellist?

A.M.W. — Well, Yo—Yo Ma
is my idol. I think he's just a
marvelous player. And of course
there's Lynn Harrell, who will be
playing Shotakovich’s First Ce//o
Concerto with the Pittsburgh
Symphony on Oct. 30, 3i and
Nov. 2. He's another great
cellist.

D.Z. — What about Pablo
Cassals?

A.M.W. — He's the grand-
father of cello playing. lf you
were To compare his recordings
with those of today's cellists,
you'd find them to have Totally
different styles. He was one of
the first pioneers to make the
cello a ‘solo instrument rather
than one that just provides a
bass line as an accompanying
instrument. He also, of course,
revived the Bach Ce//o Suite,
and he's a very important per-
son in the history‘ of the cello.

D.Z. —‘ I read that you play a
I 701 cello made by David Tec-
chler in Rome.
A.M.W. — Yes, it's a very fine
instrument, _one that I've had for
‘about five years. I guess that the
next step up would be on the
level of a Stradivarius. I played
on one in New York a couple of

_ weeks ago and asked the dealer

how much he wanted for it. He
replied, 'Oh, about a SI
million.’ So we're talking a lot of
money. '
D.Z. — How did it play?
A.M.W. — Well, you can't
really tell by playing it in a
dealer's office. But I could see
that it was a very fine instrument,
one that would carry well and
reach to the very last rows of
Carnegie Music Hall.

Beethoven's trio. "Could you
comment on the work?

A.M.W. — Yes, it's an in-
teresting composition in that it
can be played with either
clarinet, piano and cello or with
violin, piano and cello. My sis-
ter, who's a violinist, and I used
to play it together. It's probably
the first composition I ever
‘played in a chamber music recit-
al, so I know it fairly well. It's a
very exuberant piece, one of
Beethoven's early works.

D.Z. — How do your chamber
music performances differ from
your work with the symphony?

A.M.W. —— Well, it's very dif-
ficult playing in an orchestra and

concerto player with an or-
chestra or in a recital with a
piano, it's all in your lap. You
are the one leading and making
the musical decisions. In
chamber music, you share mak-
ing the decisions with the other
musicians in the group, although
you play in a somewhat soloistic
fashion. So there are three total-
Iy different ways of playing. It's
difficult to tune in to playing

chamber music if you don't do .

it often. For instance, the
Guarneri Quartet that opened
the Pittsburgh Chamber Music
Society's season here a couple
of weeks ago has been playing
together for 22 years. And no
matter how much we would
practice, we wouldn't be able to
duplicate the polish of their per-
formance. Chamber music can
be quite an acquired skill.

Z. .— You are the first
woman in history to serve as
principal cellist with the Pitt-
sburgh Symphony. How difficult
is it for women to secure impor-
tant positions in symphony or-
chestras around the world?

A.M.W. — Well, many of the
European orchestras have no
women musicians at all. In Berlin,
for example, I know that con-
ductor Herbert von Karajan
wanted to bring in a female
clarinetist, but the orchestra
refused to go along with him. So
Europeis different from what we

find here in America, where it's
more flexible and lenient. Of
course, even in this country,
there are some orchestras and
conductors who would not per-
mit a woman to assume the posi-
tion of principal cellist,
concertmaster or any other posi-
tion of importance for that
matter.

D.Z. — You've been fortunate
to perform under both Andre
Previn and Lorin Maazel. Do
their styles and approaches to
music differ?

A.M.W. — Previn was very
relaxed in his rehearsal sessions,
which were usually fairly easy-
going. He'd- tell us what it was
he wanted to hear, and it was
up to us to work on the music at
home to achieve the results he
wanted. Mr. Maazel expects
that at the first rehearsal,
everything will have been
worked out individually and that
all he has to do is to put every-
thing together with the final
touches. I think that he expects
a little more of us than did Mr.
Previn. But both had the same
goals in mind — to try to achieve
perfection. Mr.,MaazeI, I might
add, is a very fine conductor,
and we are very fortunate to

have him as our music director. '

D.Z. — Out of all of last year's
conductors, do you have a

favorite, and why?
A.M.W. —- Of special mention

is Charles Dutoit. He's a fine
conductor, one that I'd like to
see here in Pittsburgh more
often. He's so precise and has
a very clear idea of what he
wants to achieve musically. He
has a wonderful stick technique,
and his performances are very

exciting.

D.Z. — What about future
performances?

A.M.W. — This coming

spring, I'll be giving a recital at
Duquesne University in prepara-
tion for a later concert in New
York to be hosted by the Cello
Society.’ It's an unusual concert
made up exclusively of or-
chestral and piano transcriptions
for the cello by Charles Schiff of
Atlanta, who's famous for his
cello transcriptions.

R.E.M.
Syria Mosque
Oct. 24, 1986

By Dave Zafris '

R.E.M. may need to spend a
little more time at home in
Athens, Ga. They seem to have
forgotten theirroots.

At last Friday's SRO concert at
the Syria Mosque, R.E.M.
proved they could play as fast
and as loud as any upcoming
band. '

Many in the audience come
ready to dance, and they

weren't disappointed as guitarist c

Peter Buck played solid rythms to
back up Michael Stipe's vocals.

But Buck rocked that night
more than he iangled. It seems
like Buck wants R.E.M. to play
heavier and get away from their

\ Byrds-like image.

, The band performs well at a
fast pace and can really work a
crowd into a frenzy. But when
R.E.‘M. slows their music down,
they can emit a feeling of the
slowness and tranquillity of life
in the South.

Stipe's drawn-out moans on
”Cuyahoga” had the audience
singing along. The song is not

 

 

the most popular cut off their
latest LP, Lites Rich Pageant, but
Stipe's vocals meshed with
Buck's iangling guitar to provide
a harmony only R.E.M. can
produce; -

In their first encore, the band
played ”Fall On Me.’’ It could
well be R.E.M.’s best song. It
seems to be the perfect tempo
for Stipe, and his Southern drawl
helps legitimize the cry out
against acid rain, the subiect of
the song.

The only problem with the’
song is that most of Stipe's lyrics
can be understood. This wasn't
the case at the concert, of
course, as the R.E.M. singer was
slightly inebriated. But on the
album, he sings Buy the sky and
se// the s/<y/And /ift your arms up
to the s/<y/And ask the sky and
ask the sky/Don’t ta// on me —'
and it's easily understood.

There's nothing wrong with
being able to understand a
band's lyrics, of course, but
Stipe’s‘fmumbling has become
legendary. ' ’

With their new producer Don-
Gehman, of John Cougar Mel-
loncamp and Brian Setzerfame,
R.E.M.'s sound on their latest
album is much more listenablef

It's even clear at times, some-
thing Gehman helped Mellon-
camp acquire. _,

Then h'as R.E.M. sold out to
pop? No, but Stipe and the boys

have certainly changed.from

their Chronic Town EP.

R.E.M.’s last album", Fab/es of
the Reconstruction, was widely
criticized for not showing any
progress in the band. Some
critics say that all R.E.M. music
sounds the same.

But changing music isn't nec-

essarily. progression in the right '

direction. Instead of Buck adding
heavier guitar riffs, the band
would benefit more from work-
ing off of Stipe's melodies. ‘

On stage there seems to be a
certain rivalry between Stipe
and Buck, although that is not
necessarily bad. While Stipe
staggered around and crooned
into the microphone, Buck gave
his best Pete Townshend impres-
sions, leaping into _the air with
each climactic guitar riff.

But the music worked much
better when the group worked
together. Especially on their only
album—recorded cover song,
"Superman."

The song was originally re-

corded by, The Cliq

an

scure band of the '60s. It
features a three-part harmony, /
am, I am, / am Superman, and
/ /(now what’s_happening.
One reason the song works so
well live might be because
bassist Mike Mills sings the first
harmony. Since Mills is on center
stage, Buck and Stripe don't
have to fight over the audience's
attention. 0

REM. dedicated the song to
their opening act, Camper Van
Beethoven. CVB played a set-
that ranged from heavy metal
psychod.elia to country and
western. ' ‘

CVB sounded like Jimmy
Page's ”Dazed and Confused”
at one point, but later played
what sounded like country,
featuring a steel guitar.

 deconstrtin selfab/es

CVB's mainproblem is with

their vocals. Their lead singer  

sounded like he was barking out
the lyrics. But maybe that's_ too

harsh a criticism because he per- j

formed right before Stipe's sen-
sual wailing.

R.E.M. disappointed a lot of
fans in the audience because
they didn't play ”Radio Free
Europe," the song that launched
their popularity on college radio.

Hopefully, R.E.M.’s next,

album won't be as sharp and
succinct as producers and l.R.S.-_
want to make it.

Even though Stipe may be
singing more clearly in the future,

his lyrics are still too ambiguous _

to understand without putting
some thought into it. Keep on
mumbling, Michael.

William Hun‘

‘THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 31, 1986

 

He’s even greater in Lesser  

By Matthew Thornton

Too often the film industry falls
into the pits of ineptitude trying
to sell a film. They will rely on the
name of O famous actor in the
absence of quality material. Too
often sex and contrived situa-
tions are the stars, eclipsing any
chance for a meaningful state-
ment. Too often the movies suck.

Over the summer, we were
suffocated by waves of teen
soap operas and B-grade horror
flicks. It was all horrifying, ac-
tually, and I guess we should
commend the filmmakers for
havin the decency to label their

4 films t at way. There are some

bright exceptions though, albeit
too seldom. Children of a lesser

God, starring William Hurt and
Marlee Matlin, is a welcome ex-
cepﬁon.

From the first minutes, Hurt
grabs the audience with feeling
and never lets go. At times, he
holds on with strength and
power, and in other moments,
we hold his pain.

The story centers around the
growth of a relationship bet-
ween ,g teacher at a school for
the deaf, played by Hurt, and a
former student, lvlatlin.

Since Hurt’s Oscar, the world
at large has taken notice of his
talent. When Children was an-
nounced, the most frequent com-
mentl heard was, ”Do you think
he can do it again? Do you think
he can be as good?” The

answer is no. He can-be better.

He shows us the intensity of
love, not only for his lover but for
his students. Hurt shows it in less
than a minute of well articulated
lines. His co-star, lvlatlin, shows
it in a single gesture. '

lf you think I'm being too lavish
with my praise, see the movie.
After the credits roll and you sit
there stunned, see if you still feel
the same.

The film isn't a pitying plea for
deaf children. lt is, instead, a
brilliant statement about the dif-
ficulties in any relationship.

The vehicle of the film was
particularly appealing because
the deaf create an immediate
emotion with their signing, an
emotion that is sometimes lost

with spoken lines. V
This is the kind of film Oscar

winners are made of. Nowhere"

in the film does the director rely
on cheap action and contrived
circumstance to keep the au-
dience interested. You are torn
between wanting to see Sarah
speak and not wanting to see
her give up her angry resolve
that the world must learn to
speak her language if they want
to talk to her. '

There are moments of beauty
that we see too seldom in the
theater that speak of something
more personal than the action
on the screen. ‘Children was fill-
ed with those moments.

There is an electricity between

Hurt and lvlatlin rarely recreated
on film. It probably stems from
the relationship they have away
from the stage. We feel as
though we are privy to the
private moments in another per-

son's life. There is never the feel— '

ing that the actors are aware
that the camera even exists. Tru~
ly spectacular.

Hurt’s diction has improved
from ‘the muddled anger he
showed in The Big Chi//. His
lines, even at their most emo-
tional, are crisp with the cutting
edge of an insult from a close
friend. lvlatlin is no less or-
ticulate, her pantomime more
erotic than the lobster scene in
F/as/idance.

SLIPPERY WHEN WET
Bon Jovi
Mercury

By Ike Shibley

It seems that the ’way to be-
come popular in theamusic indus-
try is to find a catchy phrase,
usually a cliche, and repeat itin-
numerable times. l\/lany singles
have employed this formula for

‘success, and a few albums have

mined the method with mixed
results. The-music is the most im-
portant element in many rock
songs because lyrics are often
inaudible due to the loud guitar,
the loud percussion and/or the
inarticulate vocalist. Lyrics seem
to be an afterthought in much of

the popular rock 'n' roll

nowadays.

Slippery When Wet, the third
album from the. New Jersey-
based band Bon Jovi, is a prime
paradigm of a group more con-
cerned with the instrumentation
utilized in their songs than with
the lyricism applied to the mus-
ic. This album is a hodgepodge
of overused and oversimplified
words and phrases. The first sin-
gle, "You Give Love a Bad
Name," is a great song to
scream along with as long as
one does not pay close attention
to the wording. Jon Bon Jovi

sings: Shot through the heart/
And you're to b/ame/You give
/ove a bad name// p/ay my part
and you play your game. These
lyrics have been heard countless
times, in various ways, in a myri-
ad of other compositions. How
many artists have been shot
through the heart? And how
many have had mates who play
games with them? This single
maybefun  but not for long.

‘This is not the only song that

employs time—worn lyrics. Most

of-the titles are enough to warn
of the incompetent song-writing
contained therein. None of the
compositions have originality,
especially not with names like
"Raise Your Hands,” "l'd Die
For You," "Let lt Rock,"

‘ "Wanted Dead or Alive" and

"Never Say Good-Bye." lvlost
rock songs do not claim to have

., great messages hidden in them,

but some bands at least have

creativity at work when creating
mindless lyrics. Jon Bon Jovi and
Richie Sambora, the two primary
writers for the group, do not.

Not only is this band cliched, ' R

but they are chauvinistic as well.
Bon Jovi, the man, not the band,

. sings: Remember when we /ost
the /<eys/And you /ostmore than t

that in my backseat and You're
a /oaa’ea’ gun/ There 's nowhere
to run and even Senorita 's in the
/<itchen/She's a fistful of dyna-
mite. These guys feel that wom-
en are only good for one thing,
and they like to sing about it.

The music on the album is
predictable, but it is not bad.
The band plays well together,
and Jon Bon Jovi's voice is
palatable enough. He and Sam-
bora should continue to write the
music and should hire someone
else to pen the lyrics. '

Bon Jovi, the band not the
man, has the same chauvinistic
attitude and the same trite lyrics
as Loverboy and employs the
same producer, Bruce Fairbairn.
If they continue on their present
course, they may end up like
Loverboy, as a band that can-
not make albums but may be al-
lowed to record a respectable
song for a movie soundtrack
now and then. The last thing the
music industry needs is another
Loverboy.

together in the bath. Songs like
these could only be from a
Robyn Hitchcock album. Specif-

vically, they appear on his latest

record, E/ement Of Light.
Hitchcock seems to draw from
a variety of musical sources on
his new LP. ”Somewhere
Apart" recalls some of John Len-
non's bluesier, post-Beatles
work with its progressions and
the twisted humor of a song like
"Ted, Woody And Junior"
works much like Lennon's humor
often did. "Winchester” re-
minds one of Peter Gabriel's re-
cent music with its untraditional
song structure and clean, open
sound. The gorgeous, unusual-
ly descriptive "Airscape" has a
iangly pop sound not unlike that
employed by Let's Active.
Whatever his musical influ-
ences, Hitchcock's perverse,
perceptive lyrics are uniquely his

 

own. Hitchcock never flinches in
his dealings with life's darker
side; / 'd /i/<e to reassure you/but
/'m not that kind of guy, he sings
in "Raymond Chandler Eve-

widows, perverts and married
couples, harrowing and the
dramatic, grinding "The Presi-

more than a meteorological

Hitchcock's breaks from the
gloom, however, are some of

Robyn Hitchcock ‘will prob-
ably never write a traditional
pop song or sing about walking
on, sunshine. It is likely he wil
never achieve widespread A-
merican mainstream success. But
for those listeners who want to
get caught up in lasting, sweep-
ing songs full of affecting im-
ages, Element Of Light will stand
out. Robyn Hitchcock plays a
brand of pop refreshingly unlike
any other.

mer. Jones is no fool. He has
realized that he obviously works

cause of their partnership,

better.

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt can't overlok therangemen

By Thomas Danyluk ‘

Staff Writer

Only one more week until the big-
gest football game played in Pitts-
burgh since the '79 AFC Champion-
ship. Everybody have their tickets to
the Pitt-Miami game? If the Panthers
can bump off the No. 1 Hurricanes,
a bowl game berth would surely be
clinched for them.

Now hold on one second, you im-
petuous fans. The entire football
world seems to have forgotten that
Pitt must engage in battle once more
before those Hurricanes blow into
town. This Saturday the Panthers trav-
el northward to tangle with the Syra-
cuse Orangemen.

Big deal, right? The Orangemen
have a sorry 2-5 record, including a
42-3 wipe-out at the hands of Penn
State and a five-point loss to a weak
Army team.

Well, there happens to be an"

equalizer in the 1986 Pitt-Syracuse
matchup — via the Temple Owls.

Last week the Orangemen tripped
Temple 27-24 in Philadephia. In-
deed, the Orangemen defeated the
same Temple Owls who sloshed Pitt
a few weeks back. Maybe these guys
aren't that bad after all.

Actually, they're not. In the presea-
son, this squad was supposed to be
a terror in the East, returning 11 start-
ers, including a mercuric quarterback
named Don McPherson. The 6-0,
182lb. junior had a fine 1985 sea-
son, setting Syracuse season records
for most passing, yards (1469), and
most aerial touchdowns (12). Yet
McPherson is particularly known for
his running ability, averaging 3.4
yards per carry this year. Says Orange
coach Dick MacPherson of his lead-
er, "Because we weren't able to stop
people and get things going, I think
he was pressing a little bit. He's very
dynamic. He can throw the football,
run the football, run the option. He
certainly isn't the reason we're 2-5.
Don's probably the reason why we're
‘not 0-7!”

"the ball.

Offensively, the Orangemen have
a few other volatile weapons. Sopho-
more fullback Daryl Johnson is a
powerful blocker, who averages 5.1
yards per carry when he does handle
Wide receiver Scott
Schwedes is considered one of the
best in college football. The speedy,

. experienced Schwedes has caught 28

balls so far in 1986, compiling over
300 yards. He recently passed the
Washington Redskin’s Art Monk as
the school's all-time leader in
catches.

On the defensive side, things
couldn't be much worse in the Car-
rier Dome. The most visible impact
figure is linebacker Tim Pigeon, who
leads the team with 95 tackles. But
his supporting cast, as MacPherson
put it, "has been stinking up the
place. When teams see how we pro-
tect against the run, offenses get ex-
cited.” Last week, Temple's Paul
Palmer ripped them for 187 yards.

Whatever the case, Pitt proves to
be a better football team on paper
and should come away a winner. The
Panthers definitely have a bit of in-
centive coming into this game. Syra-
cuse has bluntly humbled Pitt over
the past two years, snatching a 13-7
victory in 1984, then pitching a 12-0
shutout last season at Pitt Stadium.
Panther head coach Mike Gottfried
will be looking to reverse what Foge
Fazio hath wrought.

Pitt, coming off a huge win against
the Naval Academy, will get their fi-
nal tuneup before Miami invades.
Still, Gottfried stresses the importance
of this particular contest. "We have
four tough games left. We’re looking
at them one at time. Syracuse does
have some good football players on
their team.” Typical coaching rhetor-
ic, of course, but what Gottfried said
has some real significance to it. If his
Panthers somehow manage to lose
this weekend, the only bowls they'll
see over the Christmas holiday will
be filled with figgy pudding. Pitt's
present objective is not to win four
games in a row, but to win one in a
row — four times.

  

has to watch closely in tomorrow's game.

_ ATLANTA (AP) — Former
University of Pittsburgh All-
America tackle Bill Fralic, an out-
spoken opponent of steroids and
other drugs in the National Foot-
ball League, said he once tried
steroids while playing at Pitt.
Fralic was a three-time All-

American at nearby Penn Hills
High School. His jersey number»,
No. 79, was retired at the end of
his senior season at Pitt. Fralic was
a first-round draft pick of the Fal-
cons and made the NFL’s All-
Rookie team in 1985.

While at Pitt, he played under
both former head coach Foge Fa-
zio, now at Notre Dame,‘ and
offensive line coach Joe Moore,
who is now at Temple.

"l experimented with them be-
cause I thought I wanted to be big-
ger and stronger,” he told The
Atlanta journal in an interview
published Thursday. ‘'1 got caught
up in the mentality of football in
the weight room. All my friends
were taking them or quite a few
of them.”

He said his use lasted only a
month, and he stopped volun-
tarily.

’'I didn't feel comfortable doing
it.  I got to worrying about what
it could do to my body."

Fralic, a second-year lineman,
said he decided to disclose’ his use

American at Pitt and a Parade All-'

of steroids because ’’I didn't want
my past use of steroids to become
an issue when the drug itself
should be the focus of every-
body's concern."

He said he has heard rumors
that his campaign against drugs

thought I wanted to
be bigger and

football in the weight
room.

— Bill Fralic

was forced on him because he
was caught using steroids, but he
denied that was the case.

''I’m not on top of aladder
preaching," he said. "l’m not say-
ing I'm a perfect human being. I'm
not saying I'm not dumb enough
to take steroids, because 1 was
dumb enough, and I can see how
somebody can fall into that trap.
All I'm doing is voicing an
opinion.”

Basketball team adjusting to Evans’ style

By ‘Robert Jordan

Sta ff Writer

Although the season debut for the
Pitt Panther basketball team isn't for
another six weeks, new coach Paul
Evans is in the process of molding his
team into his own image.

So far the practices have been long
and hard, but the players are
responding well in adjusting from ex-
coach Roy Chipman's system to
Coach Evans’ system. Evans is
pleased with the effort of all the play-
ers, particularly with last year's
returnees. ‘

, ’’I’m pleased with the effort the kids
are putting out right now. With the
new system and the new drills, it's
taken some time for them to learn it,
but that's coming along well,” said
Evans. ”Right now, Charles [Smith]
is really working hard. Demetreus
[Gore] is playing well, and Mike
[Coodson] is doing a good job at the

point. Curtis [Aiken] is just now be-

ginning to shoot the ball particularly
well, and even Jerome [Lane] is work-

ing hard, so I'm pleased with the
work ethic of our first five or six
kids.”

Assistant Coach John Calipari feels
that the players are responding well
to Coach Evans’ style of coaching.
”The players were shocked initially
at his style of coaching. He is a per-
fectionist, and he doesn't allow any
of his players to play through mis-
takes,” said Calipari. ”[There] is a big
difference between Chipman's style
of coaching and Evans’ style of
coaching. The kids are responding
well. They are doing a pretty good
job of learning the new system. They
like the new system. ‘

”As of right now, Charles Smith is
going the extra step.- He has im-
proved a great deal over the summer.
He realizes that he has to keep work-
ing in order to be a good ballplayer,
and his work ethic shows that. All of
the kids are working hard, but
Charles is really working hard.”

Sophomore forward Jerome Lane is
the first to admit that Evans’ coach-

For The Pitt News

The 1986 season has been a lot of
”Happy Days” for the University of
Pittsburgh soccer team, especially for
a red-haired forward named Bob (not
Ron) Howard. Howard, a senior from
Hingham, Mass., is indeed happy
with the events of this season.

”|t’s been a very goodyear,” said
Howard. ”Since this is my senior
year, it makes it very exciting for me.

”I knew we had good returning
players this year. We play well
together as a team, and that's a key
to our success because the talent has
always been there.”

During his first three years at Pitt,
Howard has suffered his share of in-

ing style is radically different from
Chipman's, but he likes it. Having de-
veloped the reputation of being a
Crybaby last year, Lane is working
hard to break that reputation. After an

impressive showing at the Olympic '

Festival, held in Houston this past Au-
gust, Lane has brought a new attitude
to fall practice. ”When I was recruit-
ed by Chipman, I was told that I
would play small forward,” said
Lane. ”Once the season started, he
had me playing power forward. Nat-
urally, I had to wonder about that,
and when I did, that got me in a lot
of trouble. Practice is much harder
this year, but Evans’ image makes me
want to play harder and learn more.
It will take a while for Coach to break
my bad habits, but he will even-
tually.”

Lane played power forward in the
Olympic Festival under Clary. Wil-
Iiams (head coach at Ohio State), and
he performed very well, setting a fes-
tival scoring record. He expects simi-
lar results playing under Coach
Evans. ”You have to concentrate to
understand the system. I like the way

juries, but when he is healthy the
team benefits.

”Bob potentially might be the best
scorer we have,” said Panther coach
Joe Luxbacher. ”He’s strong and has
a good shot with both feet. His main
asset to us is that he's strong, because
we're playing teams with big, strong
forwards. Bob is like a change of pace
from our other forwards who are
smaller and rely more on quickness.
His only problem has been staying
healthy, because in, the past‘ he
suffered many nagging injuries.”

The injuries have obviously been
frustrating to Howard, but he refuses
to dwell on what might have been.

”You can't ask ‘what would have
happened if?’ ” Howard stated em-
phatically. ”It would only drive you
crazy. You just look back and see

he involves everyone in the offense,” '

said Lane. ”I’m excited about this
year because I think that we'll win a
lot of games, and Coach Evans will
teach us how to win. Last year I don't
think that I knew how to win. This
year with Coach Evans I think I do.

’’I like Coach Evans’ idea of a pow-

_ er forward better than Chipman's,

and I like the system, so I'm ready to
win.”

Freshman Rod Brookin has been

‘hampered by a foot injury, but

nevertheless, the Harrisburg native is
also excited about the new season.
”Since I've been hurt I haven’t been
able to do much on the court, but the

coaches have helped me a lot,” said '
Brookin. ”The system is totally differ- '

ent from the one I had in high school.
In high school the players weren't
that smart, so if I made a mistake, it
would not have hurt me. Now that
I'm playing Division I basketball; the
players are smarter. I've learned a lot
in a short time, and now I'm a smart-
er player.”-

ing funwhile senior year nears end

what you have done. Sure, you still
dream. You dream of scoring the
winning goal in the national tour-
nament.”

However, Howard has other busi-
ness to take care of before concen-
trating on postseason play, and that
is the remainder of the Panthers’
schedule. Almost every player on the
squad looks forward to playing a par-
ticular opponent for reasons of his

.own, but Howard takes a broader

view.

”Since this is my senior year, I look
forward to every game,” said
Howard. ’’I’m just trying to enjoy this
year as much as I can, because it
won't be long before I stop playing
and practicing every day. I feel that
if we can play at the top of our game,
we can do a number on people.”

Redshirt forward Steve Maslek also
likes the new coaching staff and
doesn't mind the hard work. ”Prac-
tice is harder this year, but that's be-
cause Coach Evans is a perfectionist,”
said Maslek. ”Although he is hard on
you when you make a mistake, he
does tell you when you've made a
good play, and I like that. It makes
me work harder, which makes me a
better player.”

The general mood around the Pan-
ther camp is one of enthusiasm and
optimism. The players are sold on
Coach Evans’ coaching style, and his
system has brought them together.
Apparently, in the eyes of the play-
ers, Coach Paul Evans will lead them
into the upper echelon of the Big
East.

PANTHER NOTES: Brookin is hav-
ing a bone scan done on his injured
foot to check for a possible stress frac-
ture. He injured his foot over the

summer, but he ignored the pain un- '

til preseason workouts, when he
couldn't participate in conditioning
exercises. .

Continued from page 19

’’I don't have much time to go to
the lake anymore,” Dixon explained.
”My dad still fishes a lot. He's the
fisherman of the family. I'd like to do
more, but I don't get the chance.”

Randy Dixon is as big as Okeecho-
bee in this town — the Clewiston
High School Athlete of the Year in
1981 and 1982, All-State in football
for those two years and now a presea-
son All-America offensive tackle at
the University of Pittsburgh.

Captain Midnight, someone once
called him. He is as quiet as a mid-
afternoon bass in August — almost
shy. But as Clewiston is maturing, so
is Randy Dixon.

’'I’m learning to relax,” Dixon said.
”When you come from a small town,
you're not used to cameras being in

here. You don't know what to say. It's
hard to adjust.” \

This is finally his season, and Dix-
on is receiving more attention. It has
been four years since Dixon came
north to the rivers and hills of Pitts-
burgh. Only now does the apprecia-
tion shown to him equal his talents.

Listen to some National Football
League scouts: ‘

Gary Horton, Tampa Bay Buccan-
eers: ”He's in that top echelon of
offensive linemen around the coun-
try. It doesn't look like he has any
major weaknesses. At this stage, there
isn't anything holding him back from

being a fine NFL player.”

Charlie Armey, Green Bay Packers:

"Randy Dixon has unusual instincts ».

for an offensive lineman. He's got the
ability and talent that pro teams look
for.”

Rick Reiprish, Seattle Seahawks:
”Randy Dixon is an extremely good
athlete. He would rather finesse and
beat a guy on athletic ability more
than power people, and he's pretty
successful doing it his way. I think
he's a good prospect.”

it took only two games at Pitt be-
fore Dixon said, ”Here I am." He did
not play against Tennessee and Tem-
ple in the opening of the 1983 sea-

son, but he entered the second half.

of the Maryland game opposite Bill
Fralic and has been on the line ever
since.

Dixon was selected as an All-East V

offensive tackle for the past two sea-
sons and this year was a Cameplan
and Street & Smith's Football presea-
son first-team All-American.

He is fulfilling expectations along-
side sophomore Mark Stepnoski,
another All American candidate.
”He’s all business. His leadership is
shown through his p|ay,”'said wide
receiver Bill Osborn.

’’If he isn't the best in the country,”
Pitt offensive line coach Mike Solari
once said, ’’I would surely like to see
someone better.”

Fifty miles to the south of
Clewiston is the University of Miami,
the No. 1 ranked college football
team in the country and Pitt's oppo-
nent next Saturday. They favor the
Hurricanes in Clewiston, but their
thoughtsare always on Dixon, a na-
tive son. -

’’In my home town, they like Mi-
ami and the University of Florida,”
said Dixon, one of five Floridians on
the Pitt roster. [lohn Congemi from
Ft. Lauderdale, Walter Johnson from
Pahokee, Quintin Jones from Pom-
pano Beach and Mark Stanton from
Tallahassee are the others.] The peo-
ple at home are going to see me play,
so I really want to beat them.”

Randy Dixon remembers his
youth. Fishing. Boating. Okeecho-
bee. There is only one lake activity
Dixon has not attempted: ”Never
wrestled an alligator,” he said
smiling. v ‘

"The most I ever messed with them
was in high school. I used to toss
rocks at them.”

The Pitt women's volleyball
team must rise to the challenge
every time they take to the court.
This weekend at Penn State, the
challenge is bigger than ever.

With Virginia Commonwealth,
Temple and the nationally-ranked
Nittany Lions on the schedule, the
Lady Panthers already have their
work cut out for them. However,
Pitt will be without the services of
starting outside hitters Denise
Frawley and Lisa Stewart. It is
hoped that Frawley and Stewart,
out due to injuries, will return to
play for the Penn State match
tomorrow night.

Tonight Pitt takes on Virginia
Commonwealth University. The
Rams bring a long winning tradi-
tion to the match. Although Pitt
and VCU have never met previ-
ously, there is a "sister|y rivalry”
between the two teams. Lady Pan-
ther Noreen Coughlin will be
playing on the ”opposite side of
the net.” Her sister Margaret plays
for VCU.

Saturday morning, the Temple
Owls face the Lady Panthers. Pitt
defeated Temple earlier this sea-
son in three games. Coach Shel-
ton Collier stated, ”Both teams
have improved considerably since
our first meeting. We're.going into
this match looking at it as good
preparation for the Penn State

match.” -

Lady Panthers at PSU  

l

Pittwill battle it out with Penn
State Saturday night. This time, the
Lady Panthers are out for revenge.
Rivalry, the fact that PSU is nation-
ally ranked and the chance for Pitt
to show improvement are all
motivating factors. Perhaps the
most motivating factors are Pitt's‘
two previous losses to Penn State,

Senior captain Sue Hoover not-
ed, ”We’ve had a really great
week in practice. We're all excit- '
ed and ready to beat PSU. I think
the third time around, we'll be up
to beating them.”

Coughlin and Nora Mulvihill
will be very significant in Pitt's
game plans. In Frawley’s and
Stewart's absence, the Lady Pan-
thers will rely very heavily on‘
Coughlin and Mulvihill. Freshman
Kelly Matheis has had some qual-
ity game time and is expected to
see a lot of playing time this
weekend.

Coach Collier stated, ”We
know we have to play well. Penn
State is tough, but doubly so at
home. In spite of Denise's and Li-
sa's absence, this is a good oppor-
tunity for us to develop.” Collier
also noted, ’’In the past, the bench
has been able to ’pick up the V
slack’ relatively well. By being
forced to replace Denise and Lisa,

this could actually be a blessing _,
in disguise.”

Pitt, now -22-8 overall, is head-
ing into the toughest stretch of
their season. Upcoming oppo-
nents include Western Michigan, /
Ohio State and Notre Dame.

Staff Writer

”We can do it again if we want to.
The main point to be emphasized is
that we have set our goals and now
we're going to go‘ for them.”

These are the sentiments of men's

swimming coach Fred Lewis as both

the men's and women's swim teams
prepare to begin the season this

‘Saturday against Duquesne. The

meet will be held in Trees Hall at 1
p.m.

When saying the Panthers can ”do
it again,” he is referring to the as-
tounding victories they have had for
the past five years, including four
consecutive Big East championships.

”Our biggest meet in the fall sea-
son is going to be Villanova," said
Lewis. ”They and all the other Big
East teams know it means a lot to beat
Pittsburgh, and it is quite an honor
to know they shave and taper their
teams to try and beat us.”

Lewis said the team's main goal
again this year is to capture all the

championships it can. This includes’

the Big East, as well as the Eastern
Seaboard championships in March
and the NCAA championships in
April.

."'We are again going to try exclu-
sively for these goals. This isn't say-
ing we aren't going to work hard over
the whole season, but we've got to
keep the championships first and
foremost in our heads. This will make

us go as fast as we can.”

The men's team has a very strong
group of returning members this year,
including five Big East champions,
and an excellent recruiting class.
Lewis, though, does not wish to be
too overconfident. He refers to his
freshman recruits as ”Paper
Panthers.”

”The reason l called the freshmen
that was because they still have to
prove themselves. They look good on
paper, but I haven't seen what they
will do in the water at a meet. It is
a lot different in college than it was
in high school.” A

This new group of freshmen in-
clude three high school All-
Americans who should prove very
valuable to the team.

THE PITTSNEWS, Friday, October 31, W86

Tim Adams is a three—time state
champion and was team captain at
Bishop Hoban Prep School in King-
ston, Pa. Adams earned honors twice
in the 50m freestyle and 100m back-
stroke and as a swimmer in the 200m
and 400m relays.

Charles Frye and Rob Monte were
both national qualifiers in the 1,000m
and 1,650m freestyle. They also were
both All-Americans in the 500m
freestyle. Frye is from St. Cloud, Fla.,
and Monte is from Norristown, Pa.

Both Frye and Monte will be excel-
lent complements in distance
freestyle to returning members Dan
Langan and Geoff Rife. Their addition

Big East powers ready for swim season

hope to have another landmark year.

However, head coach David Be-

lowich wants to make certain that
they are going to take their time and
accept whatever comes.

”We would like to put to rest right
now the term ’streak’ which some
have labled us with,” said Belowich.
”Sure, it would be great to have the
exemplary successes we have had for
the past few years, but we are going
to take each meet one at "a time and
see what comes of it.”

Belowich feels this year's team has '

a great amount of talent. Also, he said
the team is ahead of last year in both
the amount and intensity of practices.

”Overall, we are more talented this
year than last year, which is saying
a lot. Plus the fact that we have been
having such intense practices — this

I feel very good about. We are one s

month ahead this year than we were
at this time last year. How this is go-
ing to translate into meet results, well,

I don't know, but I do feel very,

good.”

Belowich said he feels that the _past
two seasons’ undefeated teams were
very close to being perfection and
perfection can't be beaten. But he
does feel that this team should strive
to match it.

”These girls are very good. Though
we lostthree seniors, we gained nine
freshmen. We're good now, but the
satisfaction of being the best cannot
be topped. It will take a lot of time
and energy to match the tradition of
excellence which has been estab-
lished already over the last decade.

”Overall, however, the work ethic
is now established. There is a very
good cohesion with the girls and the

whole team is finally jelling. I hope,

this carries over into the meets. With
that type of idea going in, we
shouldn't lose at all.” '
The five Big East champions return-
ing should each prove to be very
valuable to the men's team in each

_ of their specialties.

Jim Emore holds a meet record in
the 100m butterfly and was the 1985
butterfly Big East champ. He is a
member of the 400m medley and
freestyle and relay teams.

Richard James is the Big East
champ in 200m IM and 100m back-
stroke and is a member of 400m and
800m free relay and 400m medley
relay teams. He is a tri-captain of this
year's team. He was the 1985 Big
East and 1984-85 Eastern Intercollegi-
ate Most Outstanding Swimmer. He
is a three-year All-Big East champ.

Scott Jeffries is a Big East champ

in 50m free and as a member of the
400m free and medley relay teams.
He possesses unlimited potential.
. Charles Lersch is a Big East champ
in 100m free as well as a member of
the 400m free team. He qualified for
Senior Nationals in the 1,650m free.
He should prove to be very strong
this year. . V

Frank Williams, a tri-captain, was
the Big East champ in the 400m in-
dividual medley. He is also the three-
year Big East champ. He possesses
strong leadership qualities and is at
his best in big meets. '

Kathy Bates was a double gold -
‘medalist at the 1985 World Games

for the Deaf. She has consistently
shown improvement and should
prove to be a valuable asset to the
Lady Panthers.

Marian Cassidy was the Big East
champ inthe 500m free. She is a very
versatile swimmer and is good in dis-
tance swimming.

Judy Haughton is a two-year Big
East champ in the 200m butterfly.
She is returning this year from a
shoulder injury. -

Susan Hickman, a co-captain, is a
three-time All-American in the 50m
free. She has lost only twice in three
years in all meets. Shealways proves
to be a team leader and a strong per-

‘ former.

Jodi O'Neil, a co-captain, holds the
school record in both the 100m and
200m breast stroke. She is an All-Big
East and a Big East Academic All-Star.

  GREEK OLYMPIA

FRATERNITY, SORORITY
MEMBERSHIP INCREASES

‘ In the past three years fraternity and sorority membership has
significantly grown. Since spring 1984, sorority membership has
risen from a total of 372 members to 433 in spring 1986. A total

‘ of 105 women have pledged so far this fall. Fraternity total

membership has grown from 757 in spring 1984 to 888 members
in spring 1986. '

The first dry rush drew less rushees to fraternities this fall, but
the number of rushees who pledged was higher. Last year 800
rushees were registered and 193 pledged. This year there were
only 460 rushees, but 198 pledged.

The Panhellenic Association took action to make rush easier for
rushees to understand and complete the rush period. Last year Rho
Chi was formed. Rho Chi’s rush counselors are members from
each sorority who take rushees to each house during rush. They
answer any questions the rushees have about rush.

This year there were more Rho Chis in order to make rush groups
smaller. This more personal approach kept more women in rush
and allowed more women to pledge.

GREEKS REIGN
AT HOMECOMING

_ Thomas Brooks, president of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, was

crowned Homecoming King at Saturday’s Bicentenniel Homecom-
ing activities. Micheﬂe Bellamy, who was supported by Alpha Phi
Alpha and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities, was crowned
Homecoming Queen. Other fraternity and sorority representatives
on the Homecoming Court were Barb Brody, Delta Phi Epsilon,
Sean D’Amico, Pi Lambda Phi, Dave Konkolics, Sigma Chi, Perry
Rizzetto, Phi Gamma Delta, and Michael Silvani, Pi Kappa Phi.

Greeks also participated in the annual keg roll and homecoming
ﬂoat competition. At halftime of the Pitt—Navy game,
pledges / associates from Pitt’s fraternities and sororities par-
ticipated in the homecoming halftime activities. Earlier in the week
Paige Allen, Panhellenic President, was given the honor of open-
ing the reception in honor of the Parade Grand Marshall, Roy
Rogers. ‘

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 31, 1986

GREEKS WORK TOGETHER
FOR FALL CHARITY EVENTS

Pitt’s Greeks are involved with fundraising apart from the annual Greek Weeks efforts. Phi Delta
Theta, Pi Kappa Phi and Sigma Chi are currently involved in fundraising activities. 8

Phi Delta Theta fraternity will hold a haunted house to benefit the National Muscular Distrophy
Society. Delta Sigma Phi, Phi Lambda Phi, Delta Phi Epsilon, Kappa Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta
are also involved.

Phi Delta Theta hopes to make the haunted house an annual event. Favors and candy will be
given to all children at the haunted house. Since there have been problems with tampered candy
and recent trouble in Oakland at night, the Greeks hope local children will spend Halloween at
their house instead of trick or treating. The haunted house will be open Oct. 31 - Nov. 1 from
8 p.m. to midnight. Donations are $2 for adults and $1 for children under 12.

Pi Kappa Phi is in the middle of its PUSH fundraiser. PUSH means play units for Severely
Handicapped Children. The money raised by PUSH will be used to build large play units.

This year’s fundraiser started off with a car smash in Schenley Quad. For one dollar you could
hit a car with a mallot. At the Steelers - Bengals game fraternity members along with Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority canned for donations. The Phi Kaps and Kappas will end the fundraiser with a
24 hour push-athon. A wheelchair will be pushed around Pittsburgh and end at Pitt Stadium with
the game ball for the Pitt-Miami game Nov. 8.

Sigma Chi is currently involved in their annual Derby Days. The fraternity invites all sororities
to participate in the fundraiser, which benefits the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Institute. Last year
Sigma Chi raised $1,800 and their goal for this year is $2,000.

Derby Days is comprised of small fundraising events over a week’s time. One event involves
each sorority being matched with brothers to take part in auctioning brothers for the highest bid
possible. The teams compete to win the most money. Each team also has a Derby Darling
representative. Whoever gets the most donations through coin voting is the Derby Darling. Derby
Days ends with a fun and games derby chase on the Cathedral lawn.
