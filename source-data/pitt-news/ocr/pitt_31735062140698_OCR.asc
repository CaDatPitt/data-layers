Shaughnessy, who has only been in Pittsburgh a few

during which time both the administrative officials and the
student representatives can become better acquainted with

. Members of the ESGC, who now represent student govern-

by the University concerning

Enlisted Reserve.

the Army and the Air Corps

The War Department has directed that  deferred
status of students in the Air Corps Eniisted Reserve be 
nated at the end of last semester at Pitt. These students will

To Serve Armed Force Reservists

Meeting for the first time during
the spring‘ sctliestel‘ Men’s Council
set up and adopted a three-point
war program last Monday evening.
Purpose of the war program is to
give aid to Pitt men in the armed
force reserves who will be placed
on active duty in the near future.

The threc—point war program is:

1. A committee composed of
Councilors Dick Briney, C45;
James Dunn. C43, and Paul E.
Pﬁschner, C44, will, with the co-
operation of Lawrence Irwin,
armed service liaison officer at
Pitt. set up induction clinics for
Pitt men.

2. The committee will obtain
manuals of authorized army psy-
chology tests. They will take
these manuals at convenient
places throughout the University
for the use of Pitt men.

3. Necessary funds were allot-

‘ i ‘  ;. ..   

x . T

ted to send copies of The Pitt
News to prominent USO centers
throughout the United States.

The War Program Committee
will Contact prominent niilitary
speakers to speak at the induction
clinics. The object of these speak-
ers wll be to help Pitt men orient
themselves to thespeciﬁc require-
ments upon induction into the vari-
ous armed services.

According to Dean of Men Theo-
dore W. Biddle clinics such as these
have already been approved by the
Board of Deans. They will be held
during the morning and excuses
from class will be issued by the
various dean’s offices and the office
of the Dean of Men to students who
attend the clinics:  S

Things to be discussed at'these ,
clinics will include methods of
taking armed service tests, how
to act at interviews after induc-

tion, etc. Members of the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps will be
put on active duty within the
next few weeks, according to
Dean Biddle. The first clinic will
be for their beneﬁt.

Three seats were declared va-
cant at the Men’s Council meeting.
These seats will be ﬁlled by elec-
tion of council from the School of
Business Administration, the Col-
lege, and the School of Education.

At the meeting Steve Miketic,
E43, was elected secretary of Men’s
Council, Italph Hammond, BA43,
treasurer. and Art Clarke, E45,
representative to the Publications
Board.

It was decided to again give
Panther Keys to the outstanding
freshman men. These men, 10 per
cent of their classfrwill be cited on
the basisof 's‘cholai'shi'p and activ-
ities.‘ .. . —

Registration
AllTimeHigh
For Mid Year

Largest number of midyear
freshmen ever to register in
the history of the University
began Pitt’s newest semester
this week. About 250 new mid-
year freshmen were enrolled
during the spring registration
period, according to J. G.
Quick, University Registrar.

In accordance with a release from
Pennsylvania’s Department of Pub-
lic Instruction, between 35 and 40
per cent of these students are not
high school graduates. On Decem-
ber 23 the state department released
a ruling which allows colleges and
universities to admit students who’.
have completed three and a half,
years of high school. They must
have a sati.<l‘actor_v high school-
record and a recommendation f"n"r'.
responsible high school officials.’
Mr. Quick said. 3-

After one year ofsatisfactory

work in college. these students
will be certiﬁed as having fun-
ﬁlled the requirements for high
school graduation and will lie, 
given their high school diploma. .

This plan enables young men who"
would otherwise be subject to tloc"
draft to continue their education "
provided they are preparing for»
what is called.‘fcritical occupations.” _
It is expected that men will get.
two years of college education ‘at *'

The University is big. Bigger than any of us,
or any of our groups. And the only way that the
University can get bigger is for all of us and all
our groups to think in terms of the collective

' entity that is the University—and not in terms of

its isolated parts. _

The University as-a whole—that’s the thing.
And when the University as a whole, when you

A and the guy who rides to school with you in the

street-car, are given a share of something that
once belonged exclusively to some special group—-
that’s the way the University will ultimately
grow.

The University has grown in the last four
years. We’ve seen it. You have too. If you haven’t,
then we’ve been unsuccessful in what we tried

.during our editorship of The Pitt News—maybe

we haven’t reﬂected the tremendous changes that
have taken place at the University and that are
still on the way. If you haven’t caught the spirit
of change that has been in operation and its ac-
complishments during the last few years, then
we’ve perhaps failed to show the nature of the
University as it is—dynamic, growing, never for
the smallest minute.-standing still.

The University has grown with every book that
you have ever read, every class you’ve ever gone
to, every outside reading assignment you’ve ever
done.

And that's the way the University will continue
to grow. The ﬁner and stronger its people, the

greater and more able it, the University as a
whole, will be to turn out still ﬁner and stronger
graduates.

The University has been strong and it has been
ﬁne. It has been gtrong enough to take unto itself
as a whole m_any things that in the past have
been for._certa1n groups only.

Its student government when we came here
was, for example, clearly of and for one special
group—with little functional relationship to the
student body. And from out of this fraternity-
dominated, thoroughly unrepresentative ' student
government has evolved, by the same processes of
change and growth, a student government at the
University that is freer from political bickering
than any in the past has ever been, a student gov-
ernment that can well serve the interests of a
University at war.

Right now your student government seems well
on its way to representing you. For just as the en-
tire student body wants to know how the Univer-

. sity will meet the problem, the new soldier per-

sonnel that will soon be here, just so is ESGC
(Emergency Student Government Commission)
right now investigating ways of helping the sol-
diers adjust themselves to their new environment.

The new student government, interested in
solving‘ the same problems that all of us are
thinking about, is a ﬁne improvement over the
old SFA groups, too many of which were interest-

ed in any number of insigniﬁcant things—— rang- '

ing from an equitable, if pro-fraternity distribu-

That change was growth. So was the creation

of the University Senate, which brings the faculty ,

into active participation in the affairs and policies
of the University And the appearance on campus
of the United Nations war heroes was the ﬁrst

thing of its kind in the whole history of the

school. V

The Pearl Harbor day assembly, the stamp-..

But just because we’ve got all these things, be-

in its progress is no indication that the forces of l
growth will cease to operate or that the Univer-I’

on Global Mindedness

It becomes increasingly evident, as we begin to get some
perspective on global trends, that the universities will play
an important role in the future of men. They are going to be
changed. Each university will either assume some respon-
sibility of leadership in its society or will sink into obscurity.

, Here on this campus we should have some organization,
maybe a committee, to talk about post-war plans. They
should talk about what’s going to be and what -ought to be,

— everywhere and with all the people; not just about the stu-

 dent, for what happens to be the student will be determined,
largely, by what happens to the rest of the world. .

_ There won’t be any self-suﬂiciency or any chance for
isolationism. Tomorrow’s student had better start thinking
about the Hindustani and the Slavs and the tribes of Africa.
If he doesn’t he's going to be an atavism in a society grown
sick and tired of atavisms. “

The students are ﬁghting this war. If they don’t want
to ﬁght it again, if they don’t want their children to ﬁght it
again, they had best get global-minded in a hurry.

Somewhere on campus an organization of a committee
to talk about these things needs to be founded or revived. It
might be Foreign Policy Association, International Relations
Club, Pi Sigma Alpha, or an entirely new outﬁt. But it’s got
tovbe alive and it’s got to be big. Otherwise it’s gas and ﬂuff
and a waste of time.

From Here . . . and There

WASHINGTON—(ACP)—--To get into the Army’s Specialized
Training Program in U. S. colleges, men must get at least 110 in the
Army classiﬁcation test, the same grade required of those who want
to take oﬁicer training. '

Other requirements, previously announced, stipulate that candidates
have at least a high school education. Further, they must either be in
basic army training, or have completed it. Except in the case of advanced
college training courses, men must be at least 18 and no more than 21
years old. There is no maximum age limits for advanced training.

Originally scheduled to start about Febuary 1, it now appears that
the Army’s college program won’t get under way until a later date.

A survey among 520 college students, male and female, from ﬁve
universities, reveals the interesting fact that the girls rather like to.
play poker. In fact, they also like to watch horse races and get all riled

Since Chirigos and Sheppard are tired of seeing people
and people are tired of seeing them. And since their
shoulders are getting round from being wept upon, they
have a request to make. All qualiﬁed students who have
nursed a yen to write about their “friends” and their
happy doings will be interviewed today around 3:30
£’clock somewhere in the vicinity of The Pitt News oﬁice.
Sincere, honest people who can spell and thosewho might
commit hari-kari if they should lose “face” are urged not
to appear.

Up until now Don Lingenfelter’s only trouble with
Viola Boydjieff was to convince her that his play
for her sister at Chicago U. was all in fun. But now
he has a Delt brother to contend with. Bergie Steytler

has shown quite an interest in Viola much to Don’s ‘

consternation. We should say that his troubles are
much more acute now since Bergie is deﬁnitely more
to worry about than a sister900 miles away.

A lot of PiKAs and Delts were disappointed
when Ruth Dickey transferred into the evening
school. She has a nice job and wants to keep it.
Someone in the registrar’s oﬂice, however, did re-
port an increase in evening labs.

Ann Clark, beautiful Kaufmann model, has a new
pet name for close friend Dick Welsh. She calls him
“poochie pie” (Ugh). So far Dick has stood up ﬁne
under the ribbing his brothers, “Nip,” “Lover,” Anna
Mae, Ed, and Company have given him.

When she was a transfer up at Westminister,
Madeline Howe spent many a week-end in Pitts-
burgh. And she dated a lot of Pitt fellows. Ask
Tommy Streever and Steve Bilowich. She probably
enjoyed those week-ends so much she decided to
see what the rest of the week was like at Pitt so
now she sojourns here all the time.

What some fellows won’t do for a date . . . or at
least an introduction. Augie Travaoli, Owl editor,
picked out cute Edna Schoeberg to portray a fresh-
man’s journey through registration and spent half-
an hour snapping Edna in different sequences. Not
bad. In school an hour and already in a couple of
the pages of the Owl.

Carnegie Tech had their Frear twins and now
Pitt can also boast a set of twins. They are Audrey

"Vi/hirling Spindle"

The University Press Book, “Whirling Spindle,” by
Elizabeth Moorhead is one of the February selections
of the Trade Book Clinic of the American Institute

This book tells the story of two prominent Pitts-

was selected on the basis of typography and format.

“Whirling Spindle” is the third book from the Uni-

YM and YW Sponsor
Joint Valentine Dance

YMCA’s plan for a dance to-
night at the East Liberty YMCA
has been postponed, according to
chairman Dick Brunk, E45. In-
stead, they will sponsor a Valen-
tine dance tomorrow night at the
same place. Admission is open to
anyone, and the tickets cost 55
cents per couple. Refreshments will

be served. The dance will begin at
8 o’clock.

Acceleration Adopted
By Research Bureau
Research Bureau for Retail
Training at the University is low-
ering its entrance requirements
for the duration. It has been a’
graduate school ever since its
founding twenty-ﬁve years ago.

The Bureau goes into an accel-
erated schedule on February 8th.
The students will go to school and
work in the stores every day in
the week, with no summer vaca-
tion. Students who have completed
two years of college work in an
accredited college or university
will be 5 eligible to take this new
course. This arrangement, will
make it possible for married women
to take the place of men. whohhave

gone into the ‘armed services or
into industry.

Students will have class work
at the bureau every morning and
will then put their theory into
practice every afternoon in the
Pittsburgh department stores.
They will be paid for their work
in the stores and by the end of
their course will have earned con-
siderably more than their tuition.
The course carries regular univer-
sity credit and students may be
working toward either an under-
graduate or graduate degree.

Continue---Biddle

Social activities ‘for the current
semester will be somewhat curtail-

First scheduled event to be can- ‘

celed thus far is the Heart Hop

which was to be held in the Schen- I I

which is next on the social calendar
will be conducted as planned. Also

to be conducted as planned is the 
scheduled for _:‘:,

March 12.

The remainder of the social
schedule will be acted upon by
Men’s Council and the other stu-
dent government bodies. Due to
the situation caused by the war
‘the social program must be re-'
duced. The Heart Hop was can-
celed because the WSGA consid-
ered it a ﬁnancial loss.

y  There is an interesting point being proved on campus
 a these days. They are proving that you can play for fun and
i still make it pay. And the group doing the proving is the

last year's team. That was the team that barely managed
alto win ﬁve games while managing all too well to lose ten.
¥I‘he_Army and Navy got their bids in for some of the others
and when practice ﬁnally did begin only thirteen players
‘ _i3'eported.

A few of these had played on last season's squad, a

few "had had some experience on the freshman team, and

afew more had never played at all. Because Darwin’_s sur-
vival of the fittest theory operates only when you have
numbers to select from, the original thirteen players were
stillon hand for the ﬁrst game. Dr. Carlson officially open-
ed the season when he announced that his team would
“win them all” and everyone smiled on account of because
this is what the Doctor says every year.

In the ﬁrst place, graduation took away the boys like
{Larry Paffrath who were supposed to be the mainstays of

So the season opened and the Carlson Kids just got by

Bethany and then they lost to Ohio State. The people who
know everything shook hands with themselves and agreed

S -?~- (that it was just as they had told themselves. Then West Vir-
~ ginia came to town, not without difficulty which included a

-‘ﬁght with the state treasurer. The Mountaineers were ex-
pecting a breeze and they got one, only it was so strong it
.blew them right back to Morgantown wishing they hadn’t
‘gone to all the trouble in the ﬁrst place.

But no one was giving the Panthers anything yet. That
Min was chalked up to West Virginia’s “over—conﬁdence.”
»'l‘he Pitts beat Carnegie Tech and people said, “Oh well-
!l‘ech!” But then they slid all around Johnny Lawther’s slid-

 V ing zone defense to defeat Penn State. They downed Geneva
.[ ,,"‘tv;vice, beat Cornell, and swamped Indiana Teachers before
5‘  flzhey were ﬁnally halted by Westminster.

Thefunny thing about it all is that the “experts” are
,  _f Lprobably right. Comparatively and conventionally speaking
I A lithe’ Carlson Kids have nothing outstanding in the way of

ijlftalent. They have no particular offense and no particular

ldefense. But what they do have is spirit.

. ,_;i They are playing for fun and they don’t care who
, ligknows it. They don’t know when they are licked. They have

” I 713110 respect for the reputations of their opponents and if

jnthé home team is supposed always to have the advantage

l ‘P .,‘§'the.Kids haven’t heard about it yet. They do just as well

 

l V I you the: visitors ﬂoor as on their own.

, , And nobody on this team is coasting along scholastical—

Iy. They have four engineers, one full time dental student
l(Malarkey), one pre-med (Zernich who is going into Medical
school in March), and an English Major on this outﬁt.

B We do not intend to let this degenerate into an essay on
{the hard life of a college athlete, but the fact remains that,
aside from two honor scholarships which were awarded in
high school, there are only two scholarships spread over the
entire team. All of the boys work, either to earn all or part

of their tuition.

_ Malarkey goes to work at 10 o’clock in the evening
sweeping Shadyside Academy. Artman starts work at 6:30
every morning. Frey works at the downtown YMCA as
-desk clerk. Barrett works at Jones and Laughlin.

. . Dr. Carlson calls the Kids the “Big Hearts” because
‘they give it all they’ve got. The Doctor is pretty fond of

T this crew. In fact, he is so contented most of the time he

‘ doesn’t ﬁght with the officials. “I don’t have to carry this
team,” he beams, “They carry me.”

Maybe the Kids aren’t any good. Maybe they haven’t
any business winning. But they don’t know that. They don’t
_§read the papers. They just keep on playing and ﬁghting and
having fun. But what is most important, they keep on win-

ming.

’ Playing a dominant part in the
-"rise and fall of the Plaid of Car-
negie Tech and the Panthers of
"Pitt are Kilty Captain Dave Brinn
and the Jungle Cat’s Co-Captain
‘Bob Artman. The careers of both
have traveled a paralleled course

" since the spring of ’38.

. Brinn prepped at Taylor All-
,derdice with the famous Jorgen-

‘ fson brothers. The three provided

-the Allderdice fans with an un-
defeated section team. Artman,
along with brother Ray, sparked
"Carrick to a sectional crown. In
the play-off for the City League
Championship, Brinn paved the
way for a two game defeat of

Both ﬂoormen earned varsity po-

Riflers Split First Match,
Shoot For Wins This Week

By HUGH CIIAVERN T

Matches with Georgia Tech, Cor-
nell, West Virginia, and Gettysburg
featured the competitive activity of
the varsity riﬂe team this week, but
as the complete returns have not
been tabulated as yet. the winner
is not known.

Last month the team partici-
pated in a triple match, defeating
the University of Dayton and
losing to Montana State ‘Univer-
sity. Pitt’s score of 1338 was not
enough to over come_ the 1402
compiled by Montana.‘ Dayton
was third with 1332 points.
Major Wills, team coach, com-
mented that a score of 1402 such
as shot by Montana should be
good enough to win most‘ meets.
He said further that Pitt's aggre-
gation was about of the ‘same
calibre as last year’s squad.

Shooting in the Dayton-Montana
match was done from prone, sitting,
and standing positions. -

Matches with various other
college and university teams are
conducted by mail, with each
team having ten men shoot a
score anytime during the week of
the match. The scores of the ﬁve
highest men are then mailed to

"the other schools competing in
the meet. These same scores are
also sent to every coach who then
compares the results and sees
which team has won the meet.

About 23 men compose tlieentire
team, of which ten are chosen to
shoot in the various meets. In the
Dayton-Montana match the ﬁve
highest scores were recorded by
riﬂe team captain Bruno Cengia,
who shot a 280. The four next
highest were: 270 by D. H. Desaul-
niers; 265 by R. E. Davis; 263 by

Team activity became a little
slow toward the end of the last
semester, but with the new semester
Major Wills expects the shooting to
pick up. A meeting of the team was
held Wednesday in room 244CL, the
usual meeting place.

The entire squad has been prac-
ticing since the first week in De-
cember and has begun really
active ‘competition with the week
of January 11. Dry shooting,
practice without ammunition, is
held every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday afternoons in the

Cathedral basement range, and

the stadium range is open for the I

regular practice sessions on Tues-
day and Thursday afternoons
from 3 until 5 o’clock.

New applicants for the team are
requested to attend any of the team's

meetings, for the necessary infor-.

mation for application may be ob-
tained there. Supplementary ‘ infor-
mation may be had at the R.0.T.C.
oﬂice. Major Wills is headcoach of
the team, with Captain I-Iavlak and
Sergeant Daehnke assisting. All
male students except ﬁrst semester
freshmen are invited to inquire
about application.

_l-'driday,~-February 12.   to « 

By MIKE HERMAN _
Pitt and Westminster meet to-

morrow night ogn the Stadium
ﬂoor, and believe us, folks, this
is going to be one of the wildest
games of the year.

The Panthers are deﬁnitely going
to be‘ out for blood, for they .are
ﬁrmly convinced that they got the
rawest end of any deal passed out
this year. The ofﬁciating not only
had a distinctly “home-town”
ﬂavor, but the Westminster players
proved themselves to be the poorest
type of sportsmen.

Early in the game, every time
Tay Malarkey set himself to take
a shot, one Freddie Miller, who is
a perfect example of Westmin-
ster sportsmanship, h o p p e d
aboard his back. At ﬁrst, the ref-
eree was satisﬁed to call a held
ball when this action resulted, but
later he felt that he was not
penalizing Malarkey enough for
getting in Miller’s way, so he
started calling personals on Tay
when the big Dent‘ was low
enough to try to shoot when Mil-
ler didn’t want him to.

As a result, Malarkey had to re-
tire late in the ﬁrst quarter with

‘three personal fouls called on him,

and couldn’t be used again till the
last period.

And then there is Charley
Goldblum, a sterling character
from Pittsburgh’s South High.
Charley was quite pleased to play
host to the boys from the big city,
and he wasn’t backward about
‘letting them know it. The only

day at 4:30 and Tuesday at 3:20
o’clock. The winners will play until
the tournament is completed.

For ‘investigative purposes,

girls who would like to take part
in WAA modern dance classes
may come to the organization
meeting Tuesday at 3:40 o’clock

teresting and diversiﬁed program
is being planned for the dance
group.

The volleyball games are going to
be ended by an inter-class tourna-
ment scheduled for Thursday, Jan-
uary 18, at 3 :30 o’clock. Class teams

are now being organized and any

girl who still wants to play volley-
ball may contact the captain of her
class team.

These games are not only for the
girls who excell in a particular
sport—they are mainly for the
recreation and enjoyment of the
players. All girls — upperclassmen
and freshmen——are urged to come
down‘ to the gym on Thursday at
3:30 o’clock to help make these
games a success.

trouble was that Mr. Goldblum’s
language wasn’t exactly the type
that should pass between fellows
who have got together for a
sociable game of basketball.

Later in the game, the oﬂicials
threw ohnny Swacus out of the
game because of “unsportsmanlike
conduct.” The fact was that Swa-
cus madea grab for the ball and
the oﬂicials interpreted this as a
deliberate attempt to strike the
Westminster player.

Then, in the last quarter, the
officials pulled the best one of all
by, as Dr. Carlson puts it, “ . . .
stealing a goal from us.” The
Panthers scored a legitimate goal,
but while they were doing so, 9.
Westminster player hit his head
on the ﬂoor. So the ref and um-
pire decided to nullify the goal
and call their own time out so that
the injured boy could be given the
proper attention.

All these, and other less import-
ant events, made for a deﬁnite ad-
vantage for the home team.

Don’t misunderstand the above.
We’re not cry-babying or making
excuses’ for losing. The Westmin-
ster team played very good ball, and
Carlson’s boys certainly didn’t play
as well as they can. But it shouldn’t
be too much to ask the boys to re-
frain from childish name-calling,
especially when it is aggravated

has promised to furnish this paint-

until the war is over. Then, the

Only French people partici-

There were words of greetings
from each of the three most impor-
