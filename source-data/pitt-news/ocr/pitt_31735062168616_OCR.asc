‘Exchange of Ideas,’
, Other Functions Set
 In CAP Constitution

by DAN BOOKER

Student leaders of Pitts-
burgh colleges proved their
belief in the old adage about
two heads being better than
one when they met Saturday
to approve a constitution for
the Collegiate Association of
Pittsburgh (CAP). The new
organization will act mainly

as a discussion group to ﬁnd sol-
lutions to problems common to

RALPH MANNING
Explains New Group

the member schools, says Ralph
Manning, Student Government
(SG) president and a founder of
CAP.

CAP members include Chat-
ham College, Carnegie Institute
of Technology, Duquesne Univer-
sity, Mount Mercy College, the
University, Point Park College,
and Robert Morris College. Two
representatives from the student

governments of each of these

schools will meet at least once a
month, according to Manning.
Besides acting as a forum for

discussing problems, the new
group is designed to: 1) promote
interschool contact, 2) serve as
a central source of information
about member colleges and uni-
versities and their student bodies,
and 3) concern itself only with
problems of ’a non-political na-
ture. -
Manning, in discussing CAP.
was most enthusiastic about the
exchange of ideas facilitated by
the group. Such areas as recogni-
tion of student organizations and
the handling of budgets were dis-
cussed at Saturday’s meeting.
But the organization is also
working in other areas. ASmart
Student Sliopper’s Board is work-
ing to arrange student discounts

on clothing purchased at sub-’

scribing stores. Some local mer-
chants have already agreed to
give six to ten per cent discounts
to students of member schools of
CAP. A full program should be
ready by January. ’

Manning also mentioned that
CAP was working to organize a
mixer for student. leaders of
member schools so that they
could become acquainted. He pre-
dicted that, eventually, a similar
event might be arranged for all
students. The sale of tickets for.
concerts at other schools might
also be arranged through this
new agency.

Although the approved consti-
tution provides for officers of the
group, Manning explained that
no officers will be elected until
CAP becomes larger and more
well established.

The decision to join CAP was.
primarily an action of the execu-
tive, explained Maining, and the
explicit approval of the SG Sen-
ate will not,be needed to main-
tain membership.

‘Free’ Curfews, Favors

Lunch Set for Weekend

There will be at least one de-
tail that women resident students
won’t have to worry about this
weekend. Because of Homecom-
ing, the dorm curfews will beset‘
at 12:30 a.m. Thursday and 2:30
a.m. Friday and Saturday with-
out quarter hours being assesed.
These “free” curfews were an-
nounced yesterday by Mike Wein-
garten, chairman of Homecoming.

Weingarten also announced an-
other bonus for students. ‘Stu-
dents holding weekend tickets_
(for the concert and dance) may
pick up their free favors Friday‘
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the SU.
Lobby.

Although the weekend tickets

Students Critical of Proposed  
Dormitory Site at Trees Hall

   
  
 

   

 

Student Newspapers

by HOBART HARRIS

The only problem with the new dormitorys that are
going to be built near Trees Hall_ is that there might not
be very many -people who want to live in them, This is the
general opinion of Towers residents who were interviewed
over the weekend by the Pitt News. They have heard about
the plans; they are talking about them, and they are

critical.

Only two of the 15 men who were interviewed said they

“God Is Not Dead”

Declares Rev. Prange

REV. DONALD PRANGE, discussing whether «or not God wants to
get involved, was featured Friday night .at the Crumbling Walls
Coffee House.

' by ROBERT ZAVOS ’

“When the Death of God Theology stirred up some
people in Little Rock, Arkansas, a group of worried church-
men got together and prayed for a solution,” noted Luthe-ran
minister Rev. Donald Prange at the Crumbling Wall Coffee

House last Friday.

Leading a discussion on “God Is Not Dead . . . He Just

Doesn’t Want to Get Involved”
Rev. Prange criticized many of
the church’s dogmas, while ad-
hering to a belief in God’s exis-
tence. I

In explaining his thesis he re-
lated a signiﬁcant and amusing
event. He began, “I belong to a
rather conservative group and
one day they were discussing the
theory of evolution. When the
question of whether God really
did create the world was brought
up they decided to take a poll,
and by vote they decided, ‘Yes,
God created the world.”’

In the Genesis we see man as
the creative agent of God. God
identiﬁes with man. God became
man through the incarnation.
There are a lot of Christianswho
worship God, but fail to serve
him. If people dogmatically as-
sert that God is alive, then para-
doxically God is really dead.”

In answer to a question from
the large student.audience, Rev.
Prange suggested that the church
has created a false concept of
God. “The church is preoccupied
with saving people from guilt and
keeping them out of hell.” Later
he said, “And the people accept
this—they would rather be beat-
en for a few hours Sunday morn-

during-. -the week

 
 

   

ingg then becoming _hurn_an_-beings _

He continued, “The church is,

trying to give man security with
God and it avoids getting in-
volved with a person who has a
real need for something. The
church must abandon itself just
as God abandoned himself. The
building must die too, for then
we would have people left and

not be preoccupied with an in-

stitution.” -

He was asked if he said th
same thing to his congregation
and he said, “Yes.” VVhen asked
what happened, he quipped,
“Well we did lose some atten-
dance.”

The ones who criticized his be-
lief were the ones who said he
sinned when he got together with
ministers of other Christian
faiths to pray last month.

In response to querries about
praying and miracleshe remark-
ed, “We’re the miracles——if any-
thing happens in this world it is
because we do it and if we don’t
do it then it won’t happen. If
God is God, then he isn't to be
relied upon for little emergen-
cies.” _

He concluded the discussion by
saying that the spirit of God
which motivated Christ was here

would live in the new dorms if
the University assigned them‘ a
room there. Everyone else said
that they would seek off-campus“.
housing. The objections to they

new plans were varied, but they --
all centered around the dorm’s M
distance from the rest of the

campus. Sam Burstein, LA sopho- A
more, summed up the feelings of 
his fellow residents when he

said “It’s a long, long walk down
that hill to the main campus”.

Many of the men asked whyi
this particular site had been
chosen. One asked why the Tow-
ers were not put where the Gen-'
eral Facilities Building was be-
ing put up; another suggested the.
hollow. ‘A ‘

Most of the men felt that even"?
with a greatly expanded bus -_
schedule, their lives would take 3'
on many of the aspects of com-  -

muting. Joe Belowich, LA sopho-
more, said,

it will still take an awful long

time to get up and down tha  

hill." -

Belowich felt that segregation 
of eating facilities, resulting fromi} 
i the fact that women will not live... 

in the new ‘ dorms, would also, 
discourage many of the men from .  
living in them. This was especial-  I 
ly true of men who have steady  I:
dates who eat in the Towers Cafe- __-_ 

teria.

Most of the men were curiously. 
as to how the assignment of _ 
rooms would be handled. Bob,f:**'

Coateworth, one of the two men

who said he would live in the‘A‘“"“‘

new dorms if asked to said,

“There are certain groups on *5‘

campus who would beneﬁt from

living on the hill. We’re both 
double E’s, and most of our class- ‘ 

es are up there anyway. I don’t

think the plan would work if _.

there was random assignment,
but if the administration put
most of the engineers" up there,
it would be all right.”

This view was not shared by , 
Steve f_.'_
Lynch and Ken Bogentz,‘ both En-’ " _
gineering freshmen, said that as  
freshmen they would not bene-"S
ﬁt by having their rooms on the . 
hill. “I only have one class that

all engineers, however.

is not on Fifth Ave.,” said Lynch,
“an Engineering freshman who
is sent up the hill is in as bad
a shape as a Liberal Arts stu-
dent.”

While most of the men were A ll‘
resigned to the new dorms, al1_. “‘-"‘
of them voiced the hope that the

new towers would be ridded of

many of the deﬁciencies of they

 
   

    
   
  
   

“I would end up 
spending most of my time on the 
campus, rather than going back 
to my room between classes. Noi-'=
matter how many buses are run, : f.

old. Among the irritations that t

drew the most criticism were the E-
soundprooﬁng, the recreational 

facilities, and the elevator serv-

ice. “As it is now,” said Junior »

Ken Fuller, “I would move off-
campus if I was told I must be'}:

assigned there.”

Oembel‘, 1966, must submit “Ap-

IT WAS a grey misty
night, and there were the
typical sounds of the city
traffic at the corner of
Forbes and Bates. Suddenly
there was the thud of a body
being thrown on the side-
walk, thescreams of agony
and pain, and the sight of
rich, red blood slowly ﬂow-
ing into the gutter.

There was a mass of ﬂy-
ing arms and legs—a real
street ﬁght. It seems that
two Pitt students were in-
nocently walking back to the
dorms, when they were at--
tacked by seven fun-seeking
drunken thugs. The two Pitt
students screamed for help;
yet nobody came to their aid.
The thugs did their job well.
Three of them picked up one
of the students and threw
him head ﬁrst into a car.
The student sustained a
broken jaw, the other es-
caped with only a badly
bruised face. After the thugs,
left, the two students re-
mained on the sidewalk
watching their blood mix in
with the mud in the gutter.

P...‘ 4 -— THEP PI'l'l‘ Nnws —-Monday, November 14, 1966

Often people have the image of the University administration as a
group of little men balled up in red tape, all of whom are working in a dif-
ferent direction. “You-can’t ever get anything done around here,” is the
battle cry of the attackers of Pitt's bureaucratic state.

But a group of student leaders will now have to begin to debunk some
' -is of these conceptions of the impenetrability of the administrative structure.
It -all began when the Chancellor started meeting on a monthly basis with
a few of the campus leaders. The general gripe at the first session was the
condition and facilities of the Student Union. Pictures of the poor garbage
collection, the dirty bathrooms, and the peeling paint were shown to Dr.

Instead of ﬁlling the hour with empty excuses, the Acting Chancellor ~
concurred with the students that the conditions were deplorable. Action
was begun then about cleaning up the building and Dr. Kurtzman promised‘
that other improvements would be made as soon as they were financially

Even more surprising than the frank statements of the Chancellor,

. were the quick results evident around the Union. As a follow up to an edi-
torial on the Union a Pitt News photographer searched for a feature picture

was wrong when the specta-
tors acted with so much com-
placency and neglect.
UNFORTUNATE LY the
tragic case of the two stu-
dents is not an isolated one.
Similar cases have occurred
all over the nation. The Kit-
ty Genovese incident, for in-
stance, was the widly pub-
licized case of the woman in
New York who w-as attack-
ed late one night near her
apartment. Instead of an-
swering Miss Genovese’s
screams, her neighbors sat
cowering in their apart-
ments. Another tragic inci-
dent occurred on the side-
walks of Washington, D. C.
As a woman was attacked on
the sidewalk on a bright af-
ternoon, she screamed, “Help
me someone, my God, I be-
ing raped.” Needless to say
the woman’s screeches re-
ceived attention. Yes, a large
group gathered around the
woman and the rapist. But

not one person had the

slightest thought about stop-
ping the rape. After all, no-

-body in the crowd wanted to

get involved.

It seems that today man
only cares about his own
welfare. Yes, today man is
self—centered, Consequently,
when most individuals see a
ﬁght, they tend to think ﬁrst
about the personal conse-
quences involved. Thus, we

Extra staff was assigned‘ to the Union to clean up the hundreds of

bathrooms on a weekly basis. In the past months would go by when the
bathrooms in the building were never touched, Only a month had passed
before painting began in the Union and bare floors were tiled. Some of
these improvements probably had been approved before the students’ meet-
ing with the Chancellor, but the better maintenance was a direct result of
Dr. Kurtzman’s intercession. C

The Chancellor'could have fallen back upon our $19 million debt and
explained that the University had to cut back on its non-professional staff.
Instead he realized the urgency of the situation and effectively brought
about improvements. The Student Union remains an inadequate center for

campusrecreation, it no longer is the filthy mess it once was.

There will be another grey,
dismal night. There will be
other bodies being thrown
topthe sidewalk. There will
be more screams of agony
and pain. Perhaps other Pitt

students will succumb to-

broken jaws and badly cut
faces. Oh yes, there will be
other Kitty Genoveses, and
there will be more women
raped on the sidewalk with
audiences to watch the pro-
ceedings.

THESE GHASTLY inci-

They will not cease to exist
because the general self-cen-
tered nature of man has be-
come part of the thinking-
part of our way of life. But
don’t worry, nothing will
happen—nothing at all.

People who read this col-

Student Clarifies

Previous Stand
Editor, The Pitt News:

It is obvious that Mr. Stein did
not read my letter carefully, for
if he did, he would have noted
the conspicuous absence of the
word “my.”

No, Mr. Stein, it was not my
social life that I was concerned
about in my October 2-6 letter,
but the social life of the many
dormitory students who, for vari-
ous reasons, (1) do not or can-
_not belong to social fraternities,
sororities, or similar social or-
ganizations, and who (2) cannot
always take advantage of the so-
cial whirl in this “metropolitan
area of only 2.5 million people.”
These are the students who de-
serve a little more in the way of
university-wide social events than
what is presently offered in the
winter trimester.

Further, it was my contention
that no matter what student or-
ganization was willing to sponsor
or co-sponsor a university-wide
Social event, the Allocations
Committee should examine the
proposal on its own merits, not

“lllllllIllIIIIllllllllIllll|Il|llllllllllllIlllllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllll||IIllIllllllllllllllllllllIIIlllllllllllI||I|lI||I||IlIIl|ll' '

Letters to the Editor

on who is sponsoring it. And
the program, such as the IVEDS
Weekend and Lettermen Concert,
were of obvious benefit to the
student body, especially dorm
residents, then there is no valid
reason why such an allocation
should be disallowed.

I can sympathize with Mr. Stein
however, for a student organi-
zation such as HEP, with so bas-
in and humane an objective as
the education of unfortunate in-
dividuals who do not have or
who have not been allowed the
chance to attend school, clearly
was “short changed” by the Al-

 

locations Committee. But this is . *

even more proof in support of an-
abvious fact: that the Allocations
Committee is not cognizant, ei-
ther through their own or an-
other’s will, of the needs and;
desires of a signiﬁcant number
of students attending this Uni-
versity. If they were, their de-
cisions would better reﬁect this
supposed recognition and letters
by myself, Mr. Stein, and others
would not be appearing in this
column.

Social commitment? We wish they could

other thoughts, other talents.

Like the situation in nearby Newark.

With civic and business leaders, we be-
gan buzzing with ideas. “Let’s teach higher
skills to some of the un-employed and
under—employed. Say, machine shop prac-
tice. They could qualify for jobs that are
going begging— and help themselves as
well.”

We lent our tool-and-die shop, eve-
nings. We found volunteer instructors. A
community group screened applicants.
Another supplied hand tools. The Boys

Club donated classroom facilities. Another
company sent more instructors. _

Some 70 trainees enrolled. Their incen-
tive? Self-improvement. Results to date?
New people at better jobs. Happier.

And this is only one of dozens of social-
minded projects at Western Electric plants
across the country, where our first job is
making communications equipment for the
Bell System.

So, you don’t give up ideals when you

graduate. If anything, at a company like,

say, Western Electric, you add to them.

MIAMI, Fla.—-It’s the ofl’-season in Mi-
"“-'ami-, Florida, the nation’s playground, and
the Panther football team, which was down

'‘ Miami, seemed to ﬁt right into that off-season
mood.

For the Panthers are also having an off-season
which mercifully has only one more week to
run before the closing act.

Asvwere the circumstances in the two games
previous to Miami, the Panthers were once again
the favorite entertainment for a homecoming
crowd. But against Syracuse and Notre Dame the
Panthers put on a respectable showing, despite
losing heavily.

Friday night, the heat and those intangible
lmmental factors teamed up with the constant lack
of physical factors to wear away the Panthers,
38-14. This time, after the ﬁrst quarter, the show-
ing wasn’t even respectable because the manpower
just wasn’t there. 3

Jim Flanigan was all over the ﬁeld, making 11
tackles and two assists. ‘But Flanigan couldn’t be
everywhere at once. The miracle was that he didn’t
pass out. Both Dave Drake and Greg Keller did.
The heat in the Orange Bowl deﬁnitely took its

toll.
‘ The most amazing thing about this year’s Pan-
thers is that they haven’t stood up in the middle
of one of their losing games, cursed at the top
of their lungs, and just walked off the ﬁeld. A

For the past three games the Panthers have
been battling for respectability and not victories.
Trailing 38-0 in the fourth quarter at Miami, they
were still battling.

Eddie James came off the bench in the third
quarter and with a sore arm managed to complete

ﬁve of nine passes for 114 yards. With two min-
utes remaining in the game, he connected with
Bob Longo on a 36 yard touchdown pass.

Then with only 15 seconds left in the game,
Paul Killian rushed the Miami punter, blocked the
attempted punt, and received a deep gash which
required stiches over his eye for_his efforts. Jay
McCune picked up the loose ball and churned 35
yards for a touchdown. _

And then with hardly any time left, the Pan-
thers attempted an onsides kick. They tried, but
failed, as has been the story all season.

Fourteen last minute points, though, hardly
erase the‘ memory of the previous 58 minutes of
play. It wasn’t until James replaced Bob Bazylak
that the Panthers began to move the ball at all.

Longo was at the receiving end of three of
James’ passes, plus one of Bazy1ak’s. The four re-
ceptions covered 103 yards. If Longo can latch
onto four more passes in the Penn State game, he
will break the Pitt record for the most receptions
in one game.

After having gained 114 yards on the ground
against Notre Dame, the running game bogged
down in the heat in Miami. They picked up 30
yards on 29 carries. _

After the game Miami coach Charlie Tate gen-
erously credited the Panthers for giving a good
try. “Pitt has some good personnel, but they just
ee_n’t overcome the handicaps.

A possible bowl-bound team, Miami, in con-
trast, moved the ball consistently for each of its
touchdowns. The fact that they were constantly
shutelling around their personnel made the Pan-
thers look even more ragged.

The curtain falls next Saturday on the cur-
rent Panthers about the same time as the off-
season ends in Miami. It’s a good thing for all
concerned.

  
   
      
  
    
  
   

End F rustrating Season

by ROY JACOBS ‘ ‘

It was a mighty weak ending
to a football season that started
so promisingly. The Panther Cubs
gave away their third straight
football game, losing 22-8, to the
Penn State freshmen Saturday at

Skibo Field.

“It’s tough when you ‘make it
easy for the other team,” said
coach Steve Petro afterwards, and
easy the Cubs did make. The Nit-
tany Cubs’ ﬁrst two touchdowns
came as a result of a blocked
punt returned for a score and a
31 yard interception return.

Everything started out like it
was going to be a good day for
~ the Cubs. On State’s second series
of downs, halfback Pete Johnson
fumbled the ball on his own,

and the Cubs led 2-0.

Joe McCain returned the ensu-

seven plays later the Cubs scored
their only touchdown of the
game. Denny Ferris plunged over

the big‘ play of the series was
Frank Gusti.ne’s third down 45-
yard pass to Rod Fedorchak. Al-
though the PAT was missed, the
Cubs had the early lead and ap-
parent momentum.

“The turning point,” said Petro,
“was our poor blocking and, of
course, the blocked punt. The
long pass hurt, but that was the
mistake of the backs.”

The blocked punt put State on
the scoreboard, but it was the
long pass which put them out of

Bucknell Enjoys Picnic

On   Booters’ Molasses,

Scores 2 - 0

Victory 1

_ by MIKE BROURMAN
For an offense that has been limited to three goals in
its last four games, Saturday’s soccer contest witl1 Bucknell
should have provided the opportunity to score all of these
goals which had been missed previously.‘ For a defense

--which had allowed only two goals in its’ last three games

against big powers, Bucknell should have been a picnic.
And it was, but not for the booters. In a game similar

to the contest with Akron a week ago, but with the roles

reversed, Bucknell had a picnic with the soccer team, win-

ning only its second game of the
season, 2-0. ,

The booters played as if they
were running in molasses. They
were conﬁdent of the outcome,
and lacked the drive that was
apparent in last week’s upset vic-
tory. But, for the ﬁrst 30 min-
utes,\‘Bucknel1 played the same
way.

Then came what proved to be
the turning point. In a scramble
in front of the goal, Bucknell"s
goalie was; injured. His replace-
ment was Scovey Beer, who had
last played" goalie in high school.

Beer was not sensational, but
he didn’t have to be. Three min-
utes after his entry Bob Church
scored for the Bisons. From then
on, they dropped seven men back
on defense, and guarded the goal
like it was Fort Knox.

Their efforts were helped no
little bit by the lack of cohesive-
ness in the booters’ line. ‘A team
which had averaged 15 to 20
shots a game got only eight
against the usually sieve -like
Bucknell defense. ,

Of those eight shots, six of
them wouldn’t have cracked an
egg, and were handled easily
by Beer. The seventh hit the
goalpost and bounced out of
bounds. The eighth was stopped
by Beer on his only hard save
of the game.

ship today at 1:30 p.m. and coach
Jim Banner’s optimism rises a
notch every moment because he
feels his harriers may surprise a
few people.

With a 4-3 meet record behind
them and nothing more to de-
fend than honor itself, the har-
riers would like to tarnish Villa-
nova’s perennial leadership of
long distance running.

Senior Frank Handleman, a
5-11, 145 pounder from Cleveland,
Ohio, leads the team and he
came into his own this season as
a runner. Except for the triangu-
lar meet with Kent State and
Ohio U., Handleman has ﬁnished
either ﬁrst or second in ﬁve
meets. Besides him, Banner took
along Fran Shor, Ken Lawton,
Larry Hubner, and Paul Greig.

“With 36 teams in the Univer-
sity Division, I am hopeful Frank

Son, your father might think that you're
not old enough to understand. But we're
going to try to explain it to you so you
will understand.

Uniroyal is the new international trade-
mark for the U.S. Rubber Company.

' (That only sounds complicated. A
trademark is kind of like a nickname for
companies. And an international trade-
mark simply means that no matter where
that company goes in the world, every-
body knows its nickname right away

without asking.)

Why did we need a new trademark?

Because we've outgrown our old one,
”U.S. Rubber,” the way some kids out-
grow their nicknames.

You see, about half the things we make
—such as Royalex® (a modern plastic that's
tougher than steel) or Keds® (the canvas
sneakers that you wear to play baseball)
or even your father's new Royal® golf
clubs—have very little to do with rubber.
So you can see that the ”Rubber” part of

  

Ask yo ur

our nickname doesn't fit anymore.
As for the ”U.S.” part, we make a lot

of our things in 23 different countries all

over the world-. So that doesn't fit either,
does it?

But our new nickname, Uniroyal, fits
everything we make. ‘No matter where
we make it.

Isn't it all clear now?

Could you explain it
to your dad tonight?

Atta boy.
