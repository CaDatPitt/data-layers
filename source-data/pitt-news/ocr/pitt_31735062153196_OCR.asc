burdens of the managership and did
such good work that he is‘qualiﬁed to

One thousand students are now re-
ceiving lessons each week at the Pitts-
burgh’ Musical Institute headquarters
and branches, and the Institute ranks
ninth in size among the music schools
of the country- ‘ 1
 The rapid growth of the Pittsburgh
Musical Institute has; brought with it
many problems, among them that ofa
permanent location, suﬂicient accom-
modation for teaching rooms at head-
quarters, and a. recital hall. * The first
step toward the provision of these ne-
cessities has I been accomplished
through the purchase of a large lot in
Belleﬁeld avenue, one square from the
present location, between Fifth avenue
and the First Baptist Church. -

Since coming to Pitt, James has
been active in many student clubs and
student activiti_es_, He assumed his

tary.

Of the major sports none sav
ball is nowso ‘popular at Pitt as basket
ball-—and none has had a more check-
ered career.. Until within quite! recent
years basket, ball has always faced
an annual crisis," and there have been
two or three periods when a lapse of
one or more years intervened between
ﬂoor ﬁves carrying Pitt colors.

The first Pitt . basket ball‘. teamt
seems to‘-have been that organized in
the winter of 1898-9 as ‘a -member of
the Pittsburgh league, in which it com-
peted against teams representing D.
C. and A. -C... the Y. M. C. A., Man-
chester and Homestead clubs and a
couple of others, winning second place
in a league of eight. The members of

Wallace, ‘-‘«Charlie" Lambie, “Hen”
Mcker, Roessing, Ross and Benney.
Everyone took a- hand to some extent
at managing the team. ‘ ‘

The noxt year sa;wj_.the_.same‘ team
in ‘action with the addition of Hugh
Fullerton, Mcclelland and Collins, all
the old men save Ross being back’.
During the 1900-01 season, when Ful-
lerton ‘captained, the team was man-
aged by J. T.’ Libbey. During ‘this
year again the schedule included only
local teams and some from towns at
no great distance from Pittsburgh,
few intercollegiate opponents being
met. In 1901-2 interest-waned and no
team took‘ the ﬂoor. But a year later
a reorganization found B. B. Stroud,
’04,~ managing a team of which E. T.
Edwards’ was captain.‘ — A _

Again int1904 Pitt was not repre-
sented in the floor game but in the
’04-05 season, the year famous for the
coming of Chancellor McCormick,
there was a big revival in athletic
interest in all branches. "Art” Mc-
Kean managed a team which under
the captaincy of “Joe” Thompson -made
la, creditable record. jw.McKean’,s; suc-
cessor as imanager.- was Dr. John C.

Have already mastered the Spanish
art of ‘postponement, and can -assure
accomplishments and promises for
“manana” with the glibnessl worthy of
the Spanish born. In the evening I
am not tempted by the glare of night
life-——which in brilliancy is matched
ray for ray by the gold which buys it.
For.I dwell in a really and truly Argen-
tinian home; it is large,’its accommo-
dations are good, the service and cui-
sine ultra-satisfying, the comfort _great.
‘And I forgot to mention that this par-
ticular family lists among its posses-
sions ﬁve comely daughters-; to their
credit it must be said, that they are
very kind and genteel, and don't both-
er me at all. When the story is all
told, I feel quite content to spend’ six
months of my numbered days in_ this
sunny land-——especially while the bliz-
zards rage to the northward, and busi-
ness is so crimped that there are two
and a half million men spending their
days on the street curbs. ’

Hasn't Forgotten Pitt.

I don’t wish to try to stiﬁe truth,
however. More often perhaps than is
good for me, my thoughts persist in
wandering toward Pittsburgh, and par-
ticularly the deeds, troubles and scan-
dals of old Uni have become intermit-
tent matters of speculation to me.
Even at sea I have at moments felt
this wistfulness; but the entire
strangeness of the life compared with
the style and habits of the old days
seemed to put it in a world apart, and
it didn't bother me so sharpply. But
coming ashore, it all, tumbled on me
again, like a tidal wave, and I'm still '
ﬂoundering. Even though I conﬁdent-
ly hope to get backinside six months,
those six will pile up the biggest gap
between Pittsburgh visits since June
10, 1917.

- However, I know a more practical
way to make amends. Karl, will you
do me the favor to hustle down here a‘
pP_::k of Weeklies? It's ages since I've
seen one, and am as ignora t of Pitt
affairs as a student of W. & When
I was editor of the blinkin’ sheet, I
used to read all those‘ notes from Grads
telling how anxious they were to get
a copy, but I never ﬁgured how seri-
ously they meant it, nor how soon I
would be pickled in the same bottle.
Nuf ced, Karl, but sure am depending
on that glad hand of yours to slip me
the golden headlines.

“The speaker in discussing the
management of estates and provisions
that can be made in disposing of them,
asserted that an amazing number of
family quarrels in the United -States
are caused by the settlement of es-
tates. In substantiatiating this state-
ment the speaker pointed out that in

every 10 are settledyby will, or by the
decedent himself. ’

Mr. Smyers contended that all per-
sons should make some proper provi-
sion for the disposal of their estates.
He explained how trusts can be made

an estate for a period of one year or
more and told of a movement now in
progress-among the trust companies

a community trust, designating chari-
ties that may -be provided for in a com-
bination of effort. The speaker main-
tained that wills should be drawn by
lawyers.

THE JUNIOR PROM

The Junior Prom, the climax of the Pitt social season, will be
held in the Schenley Hotel next Friday evening. Proms are land-
marks in the student’s life. M_ementos of them are among the most
cherished keepsakes of college days. --Memories of them stay with us.

Our Prom is a‘ true school institution. Year after year students,
faculty and alumni meet at the big dance, mingle for a few hours
of pleasure and cement more ﬁrmly the links that join all Pittitcs.

We feel sure that this year’s event will be a success. The. cal-
iber of those in charge is known to the students and the labors of
the committee sliould be rewarded by a large attendance next_Friday.

The Cosmopolitan Club is realizing its opportunities and its

1.” In our midst are many for-
in aims and ambitions. They

purpose and work is “understanding
eign students. They are one with .-

The members of the Cosmopolitan Club further assert they en-
deavor to “disseminate intelligent and valuable information concern-
ing diﬂferent countries and their problems, whether economical, po-
litical or otherwise.” ,

The club would have a headquarters and for this purpose will
give an entertainment on March 3. A worthy cause wouldappreciate

Fine Schedule 
Arranged For -
  Diamond Team

An attractive baseball schedule has
been arranged by Manager Clark
Green. 'It_consists‘ of 21 games, 10 of

which are away from home. The cream

of the local teams are met. W. and
J. is played twice, while both Penn
State andlWes-t Virginia. are , met
three times, once here and twice there.
In addition 'a number of smaller west-
ern Pennsylvania schools, including

Westminster, - Muskingum, Bethany
and Grove City are on the schedule.
Eastern Trip Classy
Thezfeature of the schedule is the
eastern trip and some of the’ classiest
teams in the cast are met. The trip
includes four games from May 18 to
May 21,‘Yale at New Haven, Rhode
Island :State at’ Kingston, Holy Cross‘
at Worcester and Brown", at Provi-
dence. The games With; Yale and
Brown should prove of especial’ in-
terest, although the other two teams
are always of high calibre.‘ 0 .,. , .
,A home and home series has been
‘arranged with Vvestern Reserve, the
Ohioams -being played at Cleveland on
May 7 and here on June 2. The jaunt
to -Cleveland makes a second neat lit-
tle trip for the team. ‘
The two games with West Virginia
at Morgantown take in Memorial Day,

vwhich is the feature game on the:West

Virginia schedule. The games ” at
Penn State. are‘ a partof; their annual

‘Commencement »-athletic pz~'ogram -and

are looked upon as the biggest: games
of the year up there.
Four Games at Forbes Field

I5t:‘will be possible to play four of the-
home games, including 'the‘Penn State
and W, and J., at Forbes Field on"
dates that the Pirates play away from
home. ' i

This is -the most attractive schedule
ever arranged for the baseball team
and there should be more interest than
ever in the diamond sport. Prospects.
for one of the best teams in our his-
tory are ‘good. -Practically all of -last
year's varsity holds over, while last
year's Freshman team, which meas-
ured up nearly, as, good as the var-
sity, is intact. The pitchers include
Barrett, Bloom,. Noble, Barnes anti
Townsend, who was ‘the star south-—
paw on the Freshman team several
years ago. To handle these‘_ men then.
is “Red” Sapper and Cook.‘ For-the
inﬁeld ~Clawson, Holleran, ' ‘
-Cooper, Fairand Laughran are avail-
able, while Daniels, Barber, Cook and
Adams are left for the outﬁeld. A

_ Two of the three was the record
made by the Panther ﬁve which re-'
turned from, its_eastern invasion last
week. The. teams played were Col-
fgate, ‘Syracuse and Army and out or
these Syracuse alone, was able to down
the Pitt basket ballers. The trip
savored of hardbattles but it seemed
as though -Coach. _F'lint’s proteges had
hit their stride and as a result all of
their eastern opponents were forced
to employ‘ the strongest defensive tac-
tics. . ‘ -

Jordan, the ﬂeet forward, stood out
preeminently on the trip. During the
three contests that he played in he

‘e.

‘was able to register a total of 27 ﬁeld

goals. He got 8 against Syracuse, 11
against ‘Colgate’ and 8 against‘Arm-y.
Rose and Byers _ also contributed
greatly ot the success of the team.
The ﬁrst'_gam,e played was against
Colgate. Th‘ls— was the fastest and
bitterest contest of the series. Each’
team scored fjex.tén‘sive~1y and..it was

only by tliéﬁgI'€§§«li§l§,t_‘;‘§t§5,y}'ﬁ.,/tlia-37....4§},:,1,,¥lga,g-:x,.é€..f{5.§;.,,l¥[,(3(}';-(5;-:¥,.gt.am@,g-_{gar peters,

Panther was victori;ous,. Jordan opened”
up in this game withfgﬁve ﬁeld goals‘be-
fore the :Colgate“.tea.ﬁ1n knew what was
going on. From -then on it resolved
itself into a real..ba'tt1e. Although the
Hamilton ﬁve tried -,hard in the‘ sec-
ond half they nevertheless failed to
‘overtake the Pitt, quintet and the
first‘ victory of the- trip was recorded
byfa 69-50 score. I

Then came Syracuse.‘ Here things
did not go very "well as far as a Pitt’
victory was concerned and consequent-
ly Syracuse put t'he‘on1y smudge on
the team’s record. 'In:j this game Jor-
d_an also starred. His ‘-21 points help-I
ed out immensely as time‘ and again
Pitt suddenly emerged ahead of the
Orange ﬁve’. However’ clulring the
latter part of the game the ‘Panther
slowed up and with the Syracuse for-
wards on a dashing offensive the Pitt-
ites found themselves on the short end

_of a 39-28 score. -

The last game of: the triptooli place
at West Point against‘_the Army ﬁve.
Both sides were even on Iie1d~ goals,
each side being able to register 15.
This game ended 37-31 in ravor of the,
Panther. The main feature‘ of the
game was the lack of a foul. ‘shooter
on the side of the Army men, who
were able toget overone foul counted
