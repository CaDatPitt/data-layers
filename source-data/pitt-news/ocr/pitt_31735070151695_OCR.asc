Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg embod- A

ies what it means to be a Pittsburgher and
a Pitt Panther. He’s confronted a number of
challenges during his tenure, and though
he has often overcome them through tough
decision—making, these decisions are worth
re—examination with a critical eye.

After graduating from Thiel College in
Greenﬁeld, Pa., in 1970, he went on to receive

his juris doctoratefromtheUniversityofW‘1s- '

consin Law Schoolin1973. He became avisit-

ing professor at Pitt’s School of Law in 1977 '

and became the Law School’s Dean in 1985.
Quickly rising through the ranks at Pitt,
Nordenberg took over as the Senior Vice
Chancellor of Academic Affairs in 1993 and
was then chosen as the University’s interim
chancellor in 1995.
His selection as the school’s top executive

began a period of unprecedented success at
a University already deﬁned by its numerous
past accomplishments.

Now, in his ﬁnal year as chancellor, it’s
worth lookingback onhis time at Pitt in order
to recount the challenges he faced and success
he had as chancellor.

Within these 40 pages, you’ll gain a greater

understanding of the changing social, eco- A

nornic and academic landscape at Pitt dur-
ing Nordenberg’s years here. Such changes
include massive growth in the University’s
endowment, an_ increase in research fund-
ing, an expanding student population and
a greater recognition by national publica-

tions as one of the world’s ﬁnest institutions A

of higher education.
But we also reﬂect on the areas where he
could have possibly done more as chancellor.

m the Editor: Happy Homecoming

In2009, duringthe G-20 Summitthatwas
held on Pitt’s campus, Pitt police and other
local authorities used questionable tactics to
quell protestors in Oakland, putting a black
eye on a week that stood as a testament to
Pittsburgh’s growth since the collapse of the
steel industry.

Also within the last few years, issues arose
on the state—funding front, as the University
faced drastic budget cuts and students faced
tuition increases. People have, at times, at-
tributed tuition increases to a lack of ﬁscal
restraint on Pitt’s end.’ While Nordenberg,
as the face of the University, certainly doesn’t
deserve to beartheﬁillblame forthese events,
the challenges reﬂect on his leadership. The
severity of the events and the harms and chal-

.lenges they caused to students raise a ques- .

tion: Should he have done more‘? Although

we cannot provide an answer to that, we have
provided differing perspectives on the critical
issues that the Nordenberg administration
has faced.

This weekend marks yet another celebra-
tion of the University of Pittsburgh’s storied
tradition — a tradition that began just days
before the signing ofthe U.S. Constitution and
continues 226 years later. I know I speak for
everyone at The Pitt News whenI congratulate
Chancellor Nordenberg on his retirement
and wish him the best of luck in his ﬁiture
endeavors, ‘r

I hope that you all have a memorable
Homecomingweekend thatwillhopefully in-

’ clude a Pitt victory over Virginia on Saturday.

Hail to Pitt!

MarkNordenberghas not always been known
as “chancellor.” In fact, 18 years ago, as a pro-
fessor in Pitt’s School of Law, he was known
by a much different name —- Sparky.

“It was because he had such a spark and
liveliness in him,” said Ken Gormley, dean and
professor at Duquesne University School of
Law and former Pitt law professorwho, atthe
start ofhis careerinthe’8os, met Nordenberg
in the department.

During a Board of Trustees meeting in

June, Nordenberg armounced his decision
to step down as the Chancellor of the Uni-
versity beginning August 2014. Before as-
suming the position in 1995 and serving as
Pitt’s 17th chancellor, Nordenberg held several
University positions, including professor at
the School of Law, chair of the law school’s Ap-
pointments Committee, dean of the School of
Law, interim provost and senior vice chancel-
lor for Academic Affairs. Now he anﬁcipates
a return to the classroom.

Nordenberg, who said he hadbeen think-
ing about leaving the chancellor position for
a number of years, also said he knew that “it
couldn’t go on forever,” butanumber of chal-

lenges, including University budget issues,
kepthimtiedtoPitt.' '   ' 

“Once things were somewhat more stable, ..
it seemed to me that I almost owed it to Pitt;
to say, ‘You ought to start looking for some:
one to succeed me and someone who will.
hopefully have along and productive tenure,”’V
Nordenberg said. ‘

Professor Nordenberg

Nordenberg ﬁrst joined the law school
faculty in 1977, and he has always intended
to remain in the city and at the University.
Leaving, it turns out, was never an option he
considered.

“There have been opporinunities at almost
every point in my long Pitt career to go some-
where else, and I have always said I’m not even
really interested in talking,” he said. “This is
where I want to be.”

Although Nordenberg said that he antici- _
pates returning to teaching, he hasn’t thought
speciﬁcally about making such plans yet. He
also said that “it isn’t such an automatic thing
to say [he’ll] retool and go back to teaching
the same thing [he] was almost 20 years ago.”

From the perspectives of those who taught
with him, though, Nordenberg should be able
to transition back to the classroom with rela-
tive ease.

dent Bar Association Award for Excellence in

A Teaching at the School of Law in 1984, and he

was the ﬁrst winner of the award, selected by

The chancellor’s urge to return to the class-
room, Gormley said, sets Nordenberg apart
because some retiring chancellors “reach

Gay and Greek: Reconciling the old with the new at Pitt

Natalie Daher
Assistant News Editor

When the music started to blare and the
brothers began to pour drinks at the Sigma
Chi house last year, Inter-Fratemity Council

President Zach Patton would either spend 1

time in his room or sneak away as the more
than 200 people danced and partied.

“It was just easier for me to do that be-
cause Ifelt like Iwas different,” Patton said.
“In my head, I’m feeling like I don’t ﬁt in,
and I don’t look at things the same way as
anyone else. They don’t know that, so they
think that I could be weird.”

His style of partying also might have
blown his secret.

“I would worry that if I had a couple of
drinks, I would start having a limp wrist or
something,” he said. “It wasn’t a social thing
as much of as a ‘Let’s see whatI can forget.’
I just kind of wanted to exit.” I

After months of coping with depres-
sion and conﬁding in a counselor and a

few close brothers, Patton mustered up the
conﬁdence to come out before about 80
of his brothers in April. With shaky hands
and concise words, at their ﬁnalmeeting
of the spring semester, Zach reminded his
brothers of their shared values: friendship,
justice and learning. ’

“I haven’t really been living up to my own
expectations here because I have something
that I need to share that’s been on my chest
for a while,” Patton told his brothers. “And
that’s when I told them I was gay.”

In an increasingly sexually diverse soci-
ety, the “Animal House” fraternity reputa-
tion of boozing and pawing at women is

slowly changing. As University of Pittsburgh
Greek society members reveal their sexual-
ity, Pitt’s decades—old Greek culture is being
challenged by the membership of openly

gay, lesbian and bisexual students.

Joe Andros, a Sigma Chi brother and Pat-
ton’s roommate, called Patton “a trailblazer
at Pitt.” Patton came out to Andros in fall
2012 over breakfast. Andros thanked his
friend, ensured Patton that he supported
him and called him brave for what he was
doing.

Before coming out, Patton served a two-
semester term as vice president of Sigma
Chi fraternity and was elected to be this
year’s Inter-Fratemity Council president.

To be voted into those positions, Pat-
ton composed speeches and built his ex-
perience with about half a dozen smaller
leadership positions in his fraternity and
as Inter-Fraternity Council vice president
of judicial affairs.

Law professor Ron Brand, who met the
chancellor when he was the chair of the law
school Faculty Appointments Committee

that interviewed Brand for a faculty posi— -

tion in 19 81, said that whatever N ordenberg
chooses to do after stepping downwillbeneﬁt
the University. If the decision leads him back
to a law school classroom, says Brand, then
Nordenberg is likely to, once again, contend
for teaching awards.His future, though, holds
various options.

“His experience as chancellor, however,
may make himbetter positioned to contribute
by teachingpolicy courses that cut across dis-
ciplines within the University,” Brand said. “I
am sure law students would beneﬁt ﬁ'om such

courses with other graduate and professional I

studen .”
Pitt law professor Harry Flechtner, who

. met Nordenbergin 1983, said thefactthat his

time at the University has aligned with Nor-
denberg’s work at the University “has been a
phenomenally lucky break” for him, and he

was “elated for the students of the University”
when he heard ofNordenberg’s plans to return 
to the classroom. :5

Gormley and Flechtner agreed with Brand,
affirming that Nordenberg’s skills as a profes4 
sor set him apart from other members of the I
Department of Law. _

Gormleysaidf that Nordenberg would}
know the list of his 9o—plus students’ names,
without cheating, in a matter of days. A
“I still haven’t ﬁgured out how to do that,”
he said. ‘ 4 > v ‘
Not only did the chancellor remember

where the student satinthe classroom, among
other details.

“Almost every time I have been with V

his teaching,” Flechtner said. ,

Gormley said that he received “a lot of

there was no question that Nordenberg was

Patton is a candidate for Homecoming
King. If he.is elected, he will be" the ﬁrst

, openly gay student to assume the crown

at Pitt. In short, some may come to regard
this as a successful referendum on break-
ing the tradition at Pitt of having a straight

king and queen. V -
It was much the same after his Sigma Chi

brothers found out their vice president was ‘

gay. However, some brothers who aren’t
close friends of Patton’s have not gone out
of their way to accept him. if ‘

“Even though there’s no other openly gay
members in my entire fraternity, I still had
so much conﬁdence in their acceptance,”
Patton said. “I knew that I was a leader in
our fraternity, and I’ve done a lot for our
fraternity. I would hope that they would
respect that enough to be able to get past
the fact that I was gay.”

Since joining Sigma Chi as a ﬁrst-semes-
ter freshman in Fall 2010, Patton’s brothers
have endearingly called him by the nick-
name “Patty.” In an effort to overcompen—

sate for his lack of typically masculine traits,
Patton responded angrily when one of his
brothers called him by “a girl’s name.”

“I hatedit so-damn~bad,’~’tl1esaid. V ' ‘

Andrew Hansen, Sigma Chi president at
the time of Patton’s announcement, recalled
his friend’s earlier disposition.

“He used to have a shell where if peo-
ple would push his buttons, he’d ﬂy off the
handle and getbent out of shape,” he said.
“Now, he’s a lot more comfortable and re-
laxed with who ‘he is.” /

Additionally, Patton’s revelation pro-
vided an opportunity for Hansen to learn
about a ‘culture that he previously knew
nothing about. '

“I never had a friend that was gay, and
I don’t know many people who are gay,”
Hansen said. “I was really interested and

I just kept asking him questions.”

Once a cow pasture owned by Mary Schenley
in the 1800s, the William Pitt Union started
as a hotel and slowly became the center of
student life through a long journey that
started just before the turn of the twentieth
century.

Franklin Nicola constructed the Schenley
Hotel, which opened in 1898. It become the
ﬁrst skyscraper hotel in Pittsburgh, towering
11 stories high.

Over the years, it hosted large—scale
events, including “The Meal of Millionaires,”
which celebrated U.S. Steel becoming the
nation’s ﬁrst billion—dollar company. The
hotel was also the venue for the wedding of
famous singer Lillian Russell. The Veterans
of Foreign Wars, an organization for war
veterans chartered by the U.S. government;
was also founded at the hotel in 1914. ‘

Because the hotel was such a hotspot
for large-scale events in Pittsburgh, many
former presidents stepped within its walls,
‘ including Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roo-
‘ sevelt, William Howard Taft and Dwight
l Eisenhower, who stayed the night alongwith

September 27, 2018 I The Pitt News I vvv\AA/.pitinews.com

ﬁrst lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

The University of Pittsburgh purchased
the Schenley Park Hotel, renamed in 1954,
for nearly $2 million to be used as a dor-
mitory in 1956. The hotel’s top ﬂoor was
demolished; the 10th ﬂoor now serves as
a carpenter’s office that is not open to stu-
dents. The building was transformed into the
student union in the 1960s to accommodate
the University’s continued growth.

‘ “Administration and student leaders alike
voiced elation over the dramatic increase in
facilities available for student activities and
undergraduate housing,” said a University
of Pittsburgh press release from February
15, 1956-

In the same article, Dean of Men Theo-
dore Biddle described the purchase as, “a
great step forward. It’s a simply tremendous
thing.” _

By 1983, renovations were in order to
ﬁx up the building, which by that time was
already 85 years old. -

“There was no student union on campus

when the University purchased it,” said cur— V

rent building manager Chris Chergi, who
has been working at the Union for4o years.
“The upper ﬂoors were used as men and

women’s dormitories. As student population
and campus grew, we needed a facility, and
with the event rooms that were already in
place, it seemed like the right ﬁt.”

Most of the ﬂoors were gutted inthe $13.9
million renovations that took place thirty
years ago. Only a few rooms today, including
an office on the fourth ﬂoor that is now home
to The Pitt News, remain the same.

Nearly 115 years after it ﬁrst opened as the
Schenley Hotel, the building has become the
hub of many student organizations, includ-
ing Rainbow Alliance, Black Action Society
and the Greek Life Ofﬁce. The Union is also
home to a number of student services, such
as the Office of Career Development and
PlacementAssistance and the Office of Resi-
dence Life.

Over the past decade, other renovations
have been made to the Union. In 2006, a
lounge was added to the bottom ﬂoor of the
Union. It would be dubbed “Nordy’s Place”
the following year. ‘

Chergi recalled its former title as the “rec
center.” It housed 15 pool tables, along with

graduated from Pitt in 1971, saidlit.

would have been “highly unlikely” for
fraternity membersito recruit an open
homosexual or a member of a minority
race when he attended Pitt. He is now a
Board of Trustees member at Pitt and stays

connected to Sigma Chi members through '

the organization’s alumni and mentorship
programs.

“In the ’70s, if somebody was out, it
would be highly unlikely that he could get
through the process of being admitted to
the fraternity,” he said. _

Schaefer, who is gay and who met~Pat-
ton through his mentorship of Andros,
said that the “cultural environment” of
the 1970s was far more stringent, lack-
ing the laws and models of acceptance
that are in place today. Schaefer did not
come to terms with his homosexuality
until after college, and he did not share it

with his closest brothers until ﬁve years _

after graduation.
While fraternity experience relied heav-

   R'AY 

ily upon the social aspects of Greek life,
Schaefer said that contemporary Greek
life more strongly emphasizes academi'cs,

networking, careers, and outreach and
, community service. .

Greek life at Pitt during the 1970s also .
‘composed a larger percentage of the stu-

dent population than it does today.‘

The Greek population currently makes
up about 10 percent of the total undergrad-
uate student population at Pitt, compared
to Schaefer’s estimate of 25 percent during
the 1970s. Pitt fraternities and sororities
belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council, the
Collegiate Panhellenic Association or the
National Pan—Hellenic Council.

Currently, there are 17 fraternities with-
in the Inter-Fraternity Council on campus,
accounting for about 1,000 brothers. Pitt
also has 13 sororities within the Panhel-
lenic Council on campus, accounting for
about 800 sisters.

The National Pan—Hellenic Council,
whichincludes traditionally black frater-
nities and sororities, currently has three
sororities and four fraternities active on
campus, accounting for 30 active mem-
bers.

Patton estimated that he knows fewer '

than 10 fraternity men who are openly

gay, and about ﬁve Greek men or women

have come out to him since his April an-

l_.’10llﬂC€l.Tl€I1t.

National Pan—Hellenic Council Presi-

dent William Griﬂin said in a statement
that “he is not aware of the sexuality” of

‘-_._the council’s members because the mem-

bers are “not open with [their] sexuality.”
The council’s mission, along with its values
and traditions, aims to provide support
and equality for marginalized groups,
which mal'<es,the organization more re-
ceptive to gay members, Griffin said.

A While research estimates that roughly
10 percent of the U.S. population is gay,
Patton’s estimated sum of both openly
and covertly homosexual members in Pitt
Greek organizations is equivalent to less
than 2 percent of Pitt’s Greek community.

A native of Kittanning, Pa., which he
describes as a “cliched American town,”
Patton entered Greek life because he was
attracted to the aspects of brotherhood,
self-betterment and leadership. During his
ﬁrst two years of college, Patton, fearful of
negativity and stereotypes, concealed his
homosexuality. Heldated awoman during
his freshman and sophomore years.

“I thought I was taking that to the
grave,” Patton said‘ of his sexual orienta-
tion, though at 14 he started experiencing
same-sex attractions. “I knew it my whole

life, but I never thought I’d ever act or ever i

say anything.”

Eventually, “living a lie” took its toll on ,

Patton emotionally. .

“Before, I was very antisocial,” he said.
“A social environment for an antisocial
person can lead to some serious conﬂicts
internally that manifest themselves in
fairly destructive ways.”

Changing from within

College environments are places where
young people become adults and encoun-
ter a much wider range of human’experi-
ence. This process of exposure educates
and changes them, making them more
understanding and accepting than their
more sheltered lives of home and child-
hood.

b _Pitt professor Melanie Hughes, who
teaches the class Sociology of Gender, said

that a huge shift toward acceptance of the
LGBT community is especially common

I    soda,       

, economic landscape   

Megan Trimble
Managing Editor

As chancellor of a major. American re-
search university, Mark Nordenberg
has experienced the changingacademic
landscape firsthand. Chancellor Nor-
denberg sat down with The Pitt News

. to reflect on his tenure as chancellor,

comment on challenges the University
has faced and share advice for his suc-
cessor. "

The Pitt News: When did you first

decide to retire, and what motivated

you to do so? g

Chancellor Nordenberg: I actually
had been thinking about when to leave
the chancellor’s position for a number
of years. While the decision clearly will
have an impact on my personal life, it
was less a personal decision than a de-
cision driven by a desire to trigger a
transition at what I thoughtwas a good
time at Pitt. It is a large undertaking
because t_he position is demanding, the
competition from other universities
will be fairly intense and there is a par-
ticipatory quality to such [chancellor]
searches in the academic world, mean-
ing [universities] have to organize a big
committee and then that committee has
to organize to move forward. '

_ TPN:.You sat on the Governor’s Ad-
visory Commission on Postsecondary
Education, butVPitt still saw cuts to its
fundingfl-Iow did you respond to these
cuts as chancellor, given your connec-
tion to the governor?

CN: Thefirst proposed budget cuts
were shocking. They were so deep. They
came without warning. They seemed
not to take account of all of the many
ways in which this University and others
were making important contributions
both to the Commonwealth as it exists
today, but to the country of the future.
The ﬁrst reaction, then, really was one
of almost amazement. Then that shock
transformed into determination. We

worked as hard as we possibly could to}
lessenthe proposed cuts, and we were
quite successful in doing that. The next;
year, a proposal for more cuts came.
Again we mobilized and worked as hard
as we could to resist any further cuts to

-the University’s budget. We were suc-

cessful in the sense that flat funding
emerged, but that still does take us back
nearly 20 years in terms of the levels

- of support. So it was a political victory
that still left us with serious challenges
in terms of maintaining quality within
the University. '

ITPN: How importantlis it, then, to
keep strong ties with the governor?
~ ' CN: I think it’s very important to

e have a mutually respected relationship

with the governor, as well as with lead-
ers of the legislature. We are a state-
related University, and we have relied
on support of the commonwealth, both

to keep in-state tuition rates compar-V"

atively lower and to fuel some of the
other work that we do. And to have that
snatched away or drastically reduced
really does impede our ability to keep’
making those contributions. A person
in my position does need to avoid be-
ing entangled in partisan politics, and
does need to make a persuasive case to
members of both parties.

TPN: A large social issue that passed
through the University during your time
was the push for domestic partnership
beneﬁts for University employees. Do
you think the University moved too
slowly on resolving this issue? _

CN: To answer your question in a
very direct way, we were the ﬁrst public
university in Pennsylvania to provide
domestic partnership benefits. We
worked very hard to get other universi-
ties to join us in offering those beneﬁts
and were unable to make the case. So,

we really did lead the way after moving '

litigation, and he has served on the U.S.
Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil
Procedure and the Pennsylvania Su-
preme Court’s Civil Procedural Rules
Committee.

Although most studentsfinish school
with a limited understanding of civil
procedure — the topic of a law course
taught by Nordenberg —— Nordenberg
was able to bring clarity to something
inherently difficult to understand. This
was because he was a tough and de-

» manding teacher, but always respectful

of students and able to put them at ease,‘
Gormley said.

The same qualities were key to the
chancellorship and played a role in
connecting students, faculty, staff and
alumni as the face of the University. «

A University resource I

Brand remembered the chancel-

lor picking him up in the Nordenberg

family’s station wagon for his first on-

' campus interview.

“Then, as now, he impressed me
more with his ability to make a stranger
feel comfortable than with any pretense
of authority,” he said.

The personal connections that Nor-
denberg forges with others in the Uni-

versity setting and his connection to the

region and alumni suits him distinctly
to act as a chancellor emeritus, Gorm-
ley added. .

Flechtner, who, like Gormley, was
neighbor to N ordenberg when his fam-
ily lived in Regent Square, said he and
the chancellor often car pooled home
after work.

“You get to know someone quite
well through years of waiting in traffic
near the intersection of Braddock and
Forbes,” he said, adding that the most
impressive thing was getting to know
the chancellor personally. A

Nordenberg said he wants to make
himself available to his successor to
provide help, adding that the amount
of involvement will depend on his or
her wishes.

As the Board of Trustees’ Search
Committee continues its nationwide
search for the chancellor’s successor,
Nordenberg plans to continue to move

    

the University forward in his ﬁnal year.

‘Pushing forward

Nordenberg said that the remainder
of this year will, in manyrespects, re-
semble the years that have come before
it. He does, however, expect to deliver
more targeted presentations to-alumni
groups around the country, focus on

' fundraising issues and continue to de-

velop governmental relations in the best
way possible for his successor. _

This will be a challenge, he said, be-
cause life will not slow down, but his
eyes are focused on the future.

' “In a job like this you need‘ to keep
pushingforward. If you spend too much
time dwelling on things that may have
been done differently, then you aren’t
going to be able to maintain the pace
moving forward,” he said.

As the Board of Trustees continues
to search for the chancellor’s replace-
ment —, what Vice Chancellor for Com-
munications Ken Service referred to as
one of the most important decisions 21
Board of Trustees at a major American
university can make — Nordenberg said
that he does not intend to make any
recommendation or play a role in the
selection.

Instead, he will work to position the
University in the best way possible for
the future.

Most of all, though, Gormley said
that Nordenberg deserves something he

hasn’t received for more than 18 years

years — a break.

“Mark is literally one of the hardest-
working people I’ve ever met, and I hope
the Board [of Trustees] gives him time
to catch his breath before using him as
a wonderful resource,” he said.

But the chancellor doesn’t intend to
slow down anytime soon.

“Doing meaningful work has been

four pingpong tables where the commuter
lounge is now located. He also noted the
addition of the non-alcoholic bar, created
in the interest of late—night programming.

The Assembly Room on the main ﬂoor,
along with the eatery on the bottom ﬂoor,
have also undergone recent renovations.

“The only real challenges that come
about are when we are dealing with the
main ﬂoor, because we have to maintain
the integrity,” Chergi said.

Chergi’s favorite room, which has main-
tained much of its historical signiﬁcance, is
the Lower Lounge. She appreciates the room
for its charm and history, recalling that past
visitors likely “played bridge [and] had high
tea. I can visualize that back in the day.”

The William Pitt Union is considered a
historical landmark by the Pittsburgh His-
tory and Landmarks Foundation. A plaque
denoting this was granted to the Union in
1984 and can now be found by the Fifth
‘Avenue entrance to the building. 4

The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks
Foundation is an educational program that
takes surveys from people around the area to
decide what buildings should be considered
historic landmarks in Pittsburgh. The build—_
ings chosen must be at least 50 years old

    

and have some historical signiﬁcance. The ‘

plaques granted to selected buildings aim to
preserve historic sites so future generations
can learn about Pittsburgh history.

V “The idea is to preserve sites,”Al Tann-
ler, architectural historian of the Pittsburgh

‘ History and Landmarks Foundation since

2005, said. “We want people to look at actual
buildings.”

Many might wonder what’s next for the
Union. According to Chergi, there will be
more renovations to the third ﬂoor this year.
It is to become the wellness ﬂoor, which will
include dance studios and another -study
room. She said that the University has con-
ducted projects in the Union annually, and
if they are not renovating, they areoften
planning for upgrades.

“I’ve been to a lot of student unions
around the country,” Chergi added. “There
are a lot of modern buildings, but I like the
history here. Itwould be nice if students em-
braced history in the Union and on campus
[because] our buildings have a lot of charm.”

among young people.

“Older people may be more resistant
to change than younger people, who have
grown up with MTV, a network that often
portrays gays and lesbians as people rather
than as villains,” Hughes said.

 

Hughes added that American culture

still embraces the ideas of heteronorma-
tivity, in which everyone is “assumed to be
heterosexual” in social settings, making
dissenters “abnormal.”

In same-sex‘ environments, such as
Greek life, Hughes said it’s common be-
havior to mask one’s sexuality in order to
ﬁt in. Additionally, particular same-sex
activities such as sports, which often in-
volve frequent physical contact, can trig-
ger the overcompensation of someone’s
masculinity or femininity.

“People still perform heterosexuality
and enforce it in others so that they aren’t

‘ assumed to be homosexual,” Hughes said.

During his freshman and sophomore
years, Patton said he strived to ﬁll the role
of a “conservative man’s man.” He was 60
pounds heavier, he tended to wear denim,

and he had a shaved head and bulging bi— p

ceps from lifting weights.
But now he wears collared shirts

l more often than before, his physique has

slimmed, his hair has grown long enough
to be “slicked,” and he opts for cardio over
pumping iron. _

“I’m so much more effective,” he said.

I “My physical, mental and overall demean— V

or has improved.” ‘

Hansen said he was “shell-shocked”
that his friend, who “couldn’t match his
ties to his shoes,” came out as gay. Since
Patton’s announcement, Hansen said
that he has become more open to making
friends with people whom he previously
thought he had nothing in common with.
Furthermore, he no longer makes deroga-
tory remarks about homosexuality.

“If I would have known he was gay from

the beginning, I probably would not have

been close with him,” he said. “But I was
friends with,him the whole time.”

Traditional Greek culture, which is
based on rituals such as date parties and
mixers with heterosexual men and women,
might be harder to change despite open-
minded members.

“Norms of gender roles and sexuality ~

may be changing more slowly in the Greek

_life than elsewhere in our culture,” she

said. “But for change tohappen, it needs
to come from within the system just as
much as from the outside.”

Hansen said that while the majority of

his Greek organization accepted Patton’s
homosexuality from the beginning, others
needed more time to warm to the idea.

“Although one person is [gay], you still
have an organization of 70 to 80 guys,” he
said. “Many might be changed by it, but
there will still be a select few that won’t.”

The Cathedral of Learning, painted fro

Emma Kilcup
Stcyj’ Writer

From the farthest parts of South Oakland
to the streets of Bloomﬁeld, the Cathedral
of Learning can be seen standing tall above
the medical buildings and trees as not only

a symbol of the University of Pittsburgh,

but as an essential landmark of the city
itself.

Hidden on the seventh ﬂoor of Alumni
Hall is, “One a day: 365 Views of the Cathe-
dral of Learning,” a collection of the many
perspectives that the people of Pittsburgh
— students, workers, visitors and natives
— see the Cathedral from. The collection
features paintings of Cathedral views from
each day of the year, though the production
of the paintings occurred over the course

of two years, from 1997 to 1999.

The collection spans an entire wall and
is backlit, giving a glow to the hall. The
dedication plaque explains the signiﬁcance
of the paintings as a “meditation on time,
as well as powerful evidence of one indi~
vidual’s persistence.”

While the views represent the many
neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, the artist
himself is not a native. Felix de la Con-
cha, originally from Leon, Spain, came
to Pittsburgh for his then—girlfriend and
now—wife, Ana Merino, who was studying
at Pitt.

De la Concha and Merino lived on
Friendship Avenue in Bloomﬁeld during
their time in Pittsburgh.

“When I accompanied Ana on her walk

to the University, we saw the Cathedral
emerging from different angles,” de la

‘ Concha said. “So many perspectives have

that gothic tower, contrasting withlthe
buildings in the different areas.”

At a certain point, de la Concha de-
cided that he was interested in recording
the changes of everyday: the light, sensa-

tions and unpredictability of Pittsburgh _

weather. .

“365 Views ﬁnds a dialogue with the
weather. It’s a testimonial of a moment in
time,” Merino said. ,

Both de la Concha and Merino were at-
tractedn to Pittsburgh after emerging from
the notorious Fort Pitt tunnel and seeing
the view of Downtown. They both loved the
distinct architecture and European inﬂu-

rn all angles

ence of the different neighborhoods: the
Italian vibe of Bloomﬁeld and the Polish
inﬂuence of Polish Hill.

“I’ve been to many places in the U.S.,
and I have to say,Pittsburgh is one of the
most special places. And it seems to be a
secret. [De la Concha’s] paintings transmit

that magic,”'Merino said.

Merino, who taught classes in the Ca-
thedral, loved the nationality rooms. She
thought they had a “very special ﬂavor.”
To her, the Cathedral is a symbol of knowl-
edge. _ ,

7 “Pittsburgh has a unique opportunity
to develop intellectually,” Merino said.

On Sept. 24 and 25, 2009, an interna-
tional economic summit that took place
in Pittsburgh led to protests, riots and
arrests throughout the city and on Pitt’s
campus. _

While several Pitt students attended
the demonstrations to protest peacefully
or to simply see what was happening, a
number of students were arrested or dis-
persed from areas on campuslthrough the
use of teargas and other crowd—control
measures. '

Students still remember the riots
of 2009, sporting shirts joking “I sur-
vived the G-20 riots.” Protesters from
a diverse range of ideologies opposed
what they saw as exploitative trade and‘
environmental policies on the part'of
many Group of 20, or G-20, countries.

The'G-20 includes the United States,‘

members of theEuropean Union, many
oftheir trade partners and other devel-

oped nations. On Thursday, Sept. 24,
protesters in Oakland, Lawrenceville and
Donwntown near the David L. Lawrence
Convention Center — the summit’s pri-

mary venue —- demonstrated in opposi- .

tion of the G-20 Summit and the leaders
of the industrialized world.
That night in Oakland, some protest-

ers broke windows and committed other e

acts of property destruction along Forbes
Avenue when thedemonstration against
the summit turned into a riot.

Bill Bird, who graduated from Pitt
last year and was a student at the time
of the 2009’ G-20 Summit, said that he
believed about a dozen protesters were
committing vandalism — a small minor—
ity of the full ‘group.

“A lot of it seemed like they were
people from out of town,” he said.

On Friday, Sept. 25, protesters gath-
ered in Schenley Plaza. Bird said‘ that on

“Maybe I’m actually very masculine,

He added that Greek life can often be
self—contained, restricting members from
interactingwith the non— Greek commu-
nity. He hopes to see more social events
spring up that “aren’t so sexualized,” so
that gay members_ can integrate more
smoothly.

He said that it can be daunting for a
gay brother to bring a male date to the

ing with women, and [he’s] the only one‘

At social events, Benjamin sometimes

but opted not to take his boyfriend to a

supported his decision. He wanted some

Alliance, so instead, he took a “friend
who is a girl.”

But in some instances, such as when
he’s recruiting new brothers for his fra-
ternity, he is unsure of how much to talk
about his work in Rainbow because it
might risk_scaring the new guys.

“It’s hard to bring something you
know nothing about into your frater-
nity,” he said. “Zach’s coming out starts
a conversation —— he’s in all these lead-
ership positions in Greek life, and he’s
not a freak.”

After almost four months of dating,
Patton has yet to bring his boyfriend,
Mark Pelusi, who graduated last semes-
ter, to his fraternity*house. Though his
boyfriend has met so_me of his broth-
ers. Patton said that he has to “man up
and do it” because many of hisbrothers
have been prodding him, yet he still faces
the pressures of a heteronormative soci-
ety, which labels homosexuality as “not
something you should do.”

“If I had been in a position or a place
where being gay was always all right,
I wouldn’t feel like that now,” he said.
“But it wasn’t always call right. It was

something I bid for a very long time, so

- it’s going to take me a little bit of time.”

Patton’s announcement could also
heighten sensitivity within Greek life
toward the gay community.

“People are now thinking ‘maybe one

of my brothers is gay, maybe I need to be i‘

more sensitive about how I talk about
LGBT issues or calling people a faggot,”’
Benjamin said. “Brotherhood is impor-
tant to all of us. Nobody on this campus
wants to screw over their brother or make
their brother feel uncomfortable.”
Patton hopes that Sigma Chi’s re-
sponse to his coming out will prove the
unconditional bonds of brotherhood that
many people outside of Greek life cannot
understand. -
“Out of all of this, I want people to be-
lieve me when I tell them what it’s about,”
he said. “The idea of brotherhood, lead-
ership, responsibility and betterment.”
The sorority sector
Erin Case, a bisexual member of Sigma
Delta Tau, came out her freshman year
—— roughly a month before she rushed in
her second semester. She did not mention
her sexuality during rush, and it did not

come up in her conversations with poten-
tial sisters. Those conversations focused
on topics such as her major, hometown
and hobbies.

Case, now a senior, began dating a
woman during her spring semester, and
the relationship came to light in front of
her sisters unexpectedly. One sister had
been making negative comments about
bisexuality when Case interjected.

“That’s when I said, ‘I’m bisexual, and
that’s not true,”’ Case recalled.

Once Case came out, she said that her
sisters made it a point to “,‘not make [her]
uncomfortable at all,” and she credited
them with the leadership roles she holds
today. Case served as the fundraising
chair of her sororityfor two semesters,
ﬁlling her with the “conﬁdence boost that
[she] needed to believe that [she] could
be a leader.” Now, she is the president of
Campus Women’s Organization.

l “I think people are more surprised
when people ﬁnd out I’m a feminist, and
I’m in a sorority and not that I’m bisexual
and in a sorority,” she said.

Pitt witnesses sizable endowment growth under 

Sabrina Romano
For The Pitt News

Al Novak, executive administrator in the
Office of Institutional Advancement, said
his boss has an uncanny memory of people
he knows. Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
could be far from Pitt’s campus, but quickly
remember a student’s face.

“Someone will run up to him and say, ‘I
am ...’ and Nordenberg will ﬁll in the blank
and say, ‘You were in my Civil Procedures
class in 1989, you sat in the third row,
second seat from the left,’’’ Novak said.

A talented memory comes in handy
when meeting hundreds of people. For
his past 18 years at Pitt, a large part of
Nordenberg’s job has been to be the public
face for Pitt’s fundraising effort.Norden—
berg spearheaded the Building Our Future
Together Campaign, the most proﬁtable
fundraiser for the University, which began
during Homecoming weekend 2000.

Novak described the weekend the
University initiated the campaign: The

school set up a tent between the Cathedral
of Learning and Heinz Memorial Chapel
where alumni from around the country
celebrated with students, faculty and staff.

During the weekend, students and fac-
ulty gave tours of the campus facilities
and presentations about the University
to alumni. The University closed the cam-
paign in June 2013 after quadrupling the
campaign’s original goal of raising $500
million. ~

Novak said that the University has
about 315,000 living alumni, and that
189,000 people donated money to the
Building Our Future Together Campaign.
He conﬁrmed that the University’s ﬁnan-
cial records indicate that as ofjune 2013
the endowment was almost $3 billion.

“What we know is that donors like to
invest in winners, in quality investment
strength,” N ovak said.

Throughout the year, Nordenberg —
whom Pitt Vice Chancellor for Alumni
Relations Jeff Gleim called “our chief en-

gager” — travels both around the U.S.
and internationally to visit alumni. Gleim
also dubbed Nordenberg “chancellor of
the world.”

During a tour around the country, Nor-
denberg’s typical day is comprised of in-
dividual alumni meetings in the morning
and afternoon and a small group luncheon
in between. Each evening, he speaks to a
group of a few hundred alumni.

Nordenberg also reaches out to alum-
ni through the Chancellor’s Circle event,
which recognizes both those who have
contributed $1,000 or more and recent
alumni who have donated $500 or more.
This event is held annually at Heinz Field
before a Pitt football game.

Nordenberg prefers to reach out to
alumni at large events because hecan ap-
proach many different alumni individu-
ally. According to Gleim, Nordenberg’s
endearing qualities shine at group events,
for even when he speaks to a group of a few
hundred people, he makes an individual

feel like he or she is the only one.

Gleim pointed out that Nordenberg
does not only speak to famous athletes or
physicians, but to everyone, because he “is
a chancellor of the people.”

Novak called him a “fabulous presenter
and storyteller.”

“There are times when he is done talk-
ing, and if he said, ‘I need 25 of you to climb
up the Cathedral of Learning and clean the
windows,’ there would be a stampede to
the ladders,” Novak went on to say.

Tony Fountain, president of the African
American Alumni Council, raised money
for the campaign. The 500 lifetime mem-
bers of the council have donated more than
$7 million, and Fountain has personally
donated $1oo,ooo.

“As a result of the chancellor’s leader-
ship, an expanded culture for improving
diversity was created at Pitt, which in
turn saw improved behaviors across the

who accept you no matter what,” she said.

“I recently went through a breakupfand

the first place I went to was the suite.”

At some universities, barriers to such
friendships have been implicitly imposed
from the start. Earlier this month, on
Sept. 11, The Crimson White, the student
newspaper at the University of Alabama,
published an exposé on the racial seg-
regation that permeated its Greek com-
munity.

Several sorority sisters told The Crim-
son White that alumnae of their organiza-

tion hadprevented them from admitting ‘

A‘frican—American sisters to-their house
because of their race. A
Then, a week after the article was
published and rush season completed,
the president ofthe school said that Pan-
hellenic sororities extended 11 member-
ship offers to black women, according to
The New York Times.
leen Carr, a lesbian sister who also holds
a leadership position as vice president of
membership development in Pitt’s Delta
Phi Epsilon sorority, has also found the

Col— A

sisters in her sorority to be accepting.
But like Case, she has also faced the oc-
casional derogatory remark within the
Greek community.

During rush this fall, Carr served as

a recruitment counselor, leading groups
of prospective Greeks up and down the
stairs of Amos Hall as they toured each
sorority suite. While waiting in the stair-
well, a sorority sister who she did not
know approached her to compliment her
eyebrow piercing.

“I’d get one, but I’d look like a lesbian,”
the girl joked, and Carr shrugged it off.

“You have to take it with a grain of
salt,” Carr said.~“I’m light about life. You
have to be if you’re a lesbian in Greek
life.”

Carr realized during her senior year of
high school that she was a lesbian, though
she feels the questions about her sexual
orientation such as “Have you always
known that?” or “Why.didn’t you tell us?”
automatically make homosexuality seem
abnormal. She feels that the imposed ab-

. normality especially applies to lesbians. ’

“I feel like Greek life in general is
set up to be heteronormative. Girls are

brutal,” Carr said. “You almost have to

have another identifying characteristic
to make you less weird.”

Carr referenced Ellen Degeneres’
fame for being both gay and funny as
an example. i S

In some cases, sororities might not
have strayed far from the “Mean Girls”
perception of high school.

Carr said that some sororities care
more about maintaining a, house that is
appealing to fraternity men, which will
score them invites to the “good parties.”
“Sometimes I think a sorority’s social
standing is determined by which frater-
nities they mix with,” she said.

But Carr, who typically only reveals

I her homosexuality if it comes up or to

friends she’s close with, said that be-
ing more transparent might be that ex-

V tra push that some gay women need to g
‘ seek out a sorority. She said that lesbians

should give the Greek life a chance if it
seems like a good match and not be in-
timidated “to talk to people in letters.”

Nordenberg leaves with positive impact on Pitt athletic prg

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

August 1, 2014 will mark 37 years in which
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg has been a
member of Pitt’s faculty, as he completes
his 19th year as the University’s leader. But
that day is also the one on which his tenure
will end, as he announced to the Board of
Trusteesjune 28.

Since Nordenberg took over the chancel-
lor’s chair, Pitt athletics has endured its fair
share of tough times alongside a university
that went through a bomb threat ﬁasco and
a shooting at Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic in the spring of 2012.

Olympic sports, such as track 8: ﬁeld and
swimming & diving, have remained mostly
unsuccessful and the football program had
four head coaches in the span of just over a
year as the quest to return to former glory
spans decades. But if there’s one thing that
can be deﬁnitively said about Pitt’s sporting
ventures under Nordenberg, it’s that he left

the athletic program better than he found it,
which is about as much as you could ask for.

A lot of the work done to improve Pitt
athletics’ standing was done by athletic
director Steve Pederson. Pederson was
brought back to the University by Norden-
berg, a relatively unpopular choice at the

time, and was given Nordenberg’s faith to _

improve that standing.

Look no further than the move to the
ACC, placing Pitt inythe most competitive
conference for sports such as soccer and
basketball. The transition moved N orden-
berg and the rest of the powers that be to
grant Pederson a contract extension.

On a similar note, basketball head coach
Jamie Dixon will remain on the Petersen
Events Center’s sidelines through 2023,
via a 10-year extension he signed after the
most recent season completed.

Under the leadership of Nordenberg,
Pederson, former head coach Ben Howland
and Dixon, the basketball team is undoubt-

edly in its golden age as a program.
‘Dixon’s 11-year tenure at Pitt has seen
the Panthers post a .753 winning percent-
age, three Big East championships, the
program’s only 30-win seasons and three
Sweet Sixteen appearances. Dixon’s work
following Howland’s helped the Panthers
to reach the NCAA Tournament in 11 of the
past 12 seasons.

Additionally, Pitt’s head coach set the ‘

NCAA Division I all-time record for most
victories after eight years as a head coach
with win No. 216.

From a talent perspective, the recent
years of Pitt hoops saw NBA Draft picks
Dejuan Blair, Sam Young and Aaron Gray. In
the recruiting ﬁeld, Dixon brought in some
of the most talented players to ever don the
blue and gold from the likes of Khem Birch
and Steven Adams, despite each player leav-
ing the program earlier than conceived.

While the football program endured its
bumps in the road, the Panthers are now

  
 

 

in a good position for the future under the
leadership of head coach Paul Chryst. His
recruiting efforts have already paid tangible
dividends in the form of freshman players
such as wide receiver Tyler Boyd and run-
ning backjames Conner.

The 2013 seasonstarted on a low note
after Pitt lost 41-13 to Florida State, which
is to be expected as Pitt navigates its way
through its ﬁrst few seasons in the ACC.
The future looks bright, however, and the
same can be said for other programs as a
result of the move to the ACC.

When a team faces a high level of compe-
tition, it’s only natural for that team to rise
to the level dictated by the top talent in the

conference. The next few seasons will prove _.

this not only for the football and basketball

programs, but also the Olympic sports.

Last Saturday, Pitt football’s robust of-
fensive performance against Duke could
have all been for naught if it weren’t for
one player.

N Never mind the three players nominat-

' ed for weekly awards after career outings:
redshirt senior quarterback Torn Savage,
whose ACC record—tying six touchdowns '
led to Walter Camp National Offensive
Player of the Week honors; senior receiver f

P Devin Street, who earned ACC Receiver '
of the Week recognition, and freshman
wide receiver Tyler "Boyd, who scored
three times en route to ACC Rookie of
the Week acclaim.

Despite impressive performances from
 these three players, the Panthers could

have had to endure a week knowing it
lost a game in which it scored 58 points.
Fortunately for Pitt, they had redshirt
junior receiver Kevin Weatherspoon.

Q&A

through what was a difficult time. It’s
sometimes hard to believe how quickly
social attitudes have changed with re-
spect to issues like domestic partner
beneﬁts. We were able to advance an
important cause not only for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, but statewide.
Once we announced our intention, and
ran whatever risks it presented, others
followed suit.

or TPN.: What other social issues would
you say have defined your time as chan-
cellor?

CN: I would say that the last dozen
years were deﬁned in a very particular
way by the events of Sept. 11, 2001. I
remember being in my work office that
morning and having a staff member
who had seen some notice of the first
plane going into the World Trade Cen-
ter coming in and saying, “You have
to come in and look at the television.”
None of us could believe that this had
happened in New York, thenin Virginia
and Pennsylvania. We didn’t know what
this meant for our campus or for Pitts-
burgh, given the paths that were being
flownby some of the planes that were
involved. We had students who had rela-
tives that worked in lower Manhattan,
in the Pentagon or near the Pentagon

‘ who couldn’t make telephone contact
because of some of the circumstances. I V
remember coming in here and watching I

the television and then spending the
rest of the day talking to our security
people, on whom I depended, or being

out on campus talking to students not ’
knowing myself quite what to say but —
, feeling as if my presence in their midst

would be positive.

TPN: As chancellor, how do you pre-
pare yourself for unforeseen issues that
arise for the University?

CN: The keys, I think, are to be ready
to receive new information, to move
forward with a commitment to a wel-
coming set of human values, to make
certain that you have members of your
team who are insightful advisers on
issues of whichever type and then to
move forward in the most thoughtful,

responsible way that you can.

TPN: How has the educational land-
scape changed during your time in the
higher-education ﬁeld? * 

CN: There was a commitment to
higherveducation that I think wouldbe

exhilarating if we saw anything closeito ~
"it today. Thatcommitment was driven
both by a belief that we owe something.

to the next generation and by a belief
that high-quality higher education is
a key ingredient to building collective
community and social strength. I think
that all of that has proven to be true.
Yet today, we see a pattern of retreat
from public support for public higher
education. Part of it isa product of the
challenging economic times, but part
of it + if you listen to some people —
is a false belief that everything they
achieved in their lives they did on their
own. They believe that everyone else,
whether you are 18 or 80, whether you
are well-to—do or poor, ought to just take
care of themselves, and I don’t believe
that is the way the world works.

TPN: What would you identify as
your biggest accomplishment as chan-
cellor? _

CN: If there is one thing that will
probably make me feel best when I leave
this position, it is the sense that peo-
ple really are proud of the University.

_ Whether they are students or faculty or"

alumni, they care about the future of
the University and they want to stay en-
gaged with Pitt. You can feel that when
you walk across the campus and talk to
people. You can feel that when you run
into-alumni on the streets of Pittsburgh
or in more distant airports. It is a won-
derful thing. This is a human institution
and the way the human beings that are
connected to the institution feel about
it really is important.

TPN: What advice would you provide
for your successor? _ -

CN: I would say that it is a wonderful
community that has made very substan-
tial progress. I would say that there is no
reason for our momentum to slow, and
that if you believe in higher education,

‘I enjoy working hard and like working

with good people, this will be a great

With just more than two minutes re-

. “Defensively, shoot, they’ve been
great on third down,” Chryst said of the
Cavaliers’ unit in his-weekly press confer-
ence. Virginia ranks fourth inthe nation
in preventing third—down conversions at
22 percent. . _ .
Conversely, the Panthers have strug-
gled in their first -three games, reaching
the first-down marker on just 4o‘percent
of all third-downchances. The Panthers

‘rank 66th in the country in that stat —- .

the top teams incollege footfballgenerally
have a 60 percent success rate or better.
Of course, another struggle for the

6 Panthers has been the offense’s penchant .

for turnovers -— their six giveaways in 3
three games is in the middle ‘of the pack
for FBS teams — combined with the de-
fense’s anemic takeaway numbers.

So far this season, the Panthers are at
a minus-one turnover margin, which they
may edge to the positive side against a
Virginia team that has been much worse.
The Cavaliers, who have just one inter-
ceptionthis season, stand at _a minus—ﬁve
turnover margin.

But while the Virginia defense has
been suspect in terms of takeaways, it is
still a formidable unit. The Cavaliers are
tied for the 33rd-stingiest defense in the
country in terms of yardage allowed, sur- .
rendering just over 332 yards per game.‘
Virginia has "yielded an average of 25-

 
 

points per game, though the number is

59-10, but the Cavs have bookended that
loss with wins over Brigham Young and
Virginia Military Institute.

It is understandable that a team could
surrender 59 points to Oregon, which
is "averaging more than 61 points and
672 yards of offense per game. The Pan-

thers allowed nearly that many against,

Duke, which averaged 29 pointsin its

“Thank God we didn’t give up 59, ‘-

j His tone was more stoic as he added,
“It’s goingto be another big challenge
this week with Virginia. They’ve got a
‘ [couple backs that are really good. They’re
"running the ball [well] right now. I think

The standout offensive players House
referenced are redshirt sophomore.quar-
terback David Watford, who is in his first

. season as a starter,‘and running backs

Kevin Parks, a junior, and Daniel Hamm,

Watford has completed 66.3 per-

half of her house because of a leadership
position that she currently holds. When
the role in her current position concludes
at the end of the semester, her true ori-

entation “won’t be a secret” to the rest‘

of her sisters.

“With what my position is, if someone
was uncomfortable with my sexual orien—

position,” she explained. “I can’t really do
my job if they aren’t comfortable coming

“If you are looking for quality people,
I think that being gay [in Greek life] is
ﬁne,” she said, noting that some houses
would not be OK with bisexual or homo-
sexual members. “In some other houses
where they are less accepting of differ-
ences in people, I don’t think that would
be OK.”

Adversity to overcome

The outside world has not been quite

as giving his brothers the opportunity to
meet his partner at their fraternity house.

While recently walking through Se-

‘ a Sunday night, a group of young men

drove by and screamed “faggot” out of
their car window.

Although the incident reminded Pat-
ton that the entire world might not be
so accepting, he is grateful for the Greek
setting where he can feel “welcomed, ac-
cepted and respected.”

“I feel safe at Pitt, and I feel safe in my

No football game—day experience is complete
without a great pregametailgate. And to have
a truly great tailgate, you’ll need some truly
great food to munch on. '

Over time, a particular blend of cuisines
has become the hallmark of tailgate dining
l— part barbecue, part picnic. Andwhile many
tailgaters turn to go—to barbecue staples such
as hot dogs and hamburgers to ﬁll their plates
and stomachs, these tired selections can some-

times leave tastebuds unfulﬁlled.

A satisfying tailgate requires just a bit of
creativity to produce a varied spread of both
snacks and more substantial main-course
itern_s for you and your tailgating companions
to gnjoy. To start ﬁlling those main—course
slots in your menu, consider adding more
sophisticated barbecue treats, such as grilled
kebabs.

Though most wouldnft consider kebabs
quite as blue,—blooded American as a football
tailgate, the Middle-Eastem dish can be just
as delightfully messy as a juicy rack of ribs.
The beneﬁt of kebabs is that they are often
signiﬁcantly cheaper to prepare than the
aforementioned ribs —— though I’ll admit the
kebab veggies might be a bit less satisfying.

You can put whatever meats, fruits and
veggies you’d like on these, but my favorite
variety includes chunks of chicken, pineapple
and green pepper. Slather your skewers with
some sweet, tangy barbecue sauce while they
sit on the grill to help tie the varied ﬂavor com-
ponents together.

' If you’re using wooden skewers, be sure to
soak them in water overnightbefore skewering
and grilling — otherwise, they’ll burn away.
Metal skewers, though they don’t require this
extra step, are more expensive and can’t just
be thrown away like the wooden ones.

  Hydration key to great tailgatingexperience   

Vincent Smith
Staff W riter

IfPittfootball is playing at noon on asaturday,
you canbetthatAndrew Hansen, senior at Pitt
and a member of Pitt’s Greek Life, will be rest-
ing up Friday night for the upcoming tailgate.

“There is nothing worse than waking up
an hour before the game, realizing you have
to go straight into the stadium,” said Hansen,
who has helped supervise many tailgates in
his days at Pitt. , ’

But the combination of drinking alcohol
———with the sun beating down and many skip-

. ping breakfast to save on time — can have

negative consequences if the celebrations are
notplarmed correctly. 7

That’s why when Hansen described a good
tailgate, the focus was not solely on the beer
— although that issometimes an important
aspect. _“It’s nice to have a good mix of beer
and food,” he said, which includes hamburg-
ers and hot dogs, as well as afew ﬁnger foods
such as chips and dip.

Marian Vanek, director of Student Health

Services, echoed Hansen’s sentiments. “Hav—
ing food in your stomach, particularly foods
that are higher in fat or protein, will slow the
absorption of alcohol,” she said over email.

What Hansen deemed “tailgate food” is .

actually the best thing for your body to take

. in while drinking beer.

Both Hansen and Vanek also stressed the
importance ofhaving plenty of water on hand.
Vanek recommends tailgaters to “alternate
between alcoholic and non—alcoholic bev-
erages” to help pace consumption and stay

hydrated. Hansen was adamant that water ,

is key: If the sun is out, beer just doesn’t cut it.

But that doesn’t mean thatatailgate should
be totally relegated to supervising those

that everyone should be of age and aid in the
planning of the tailgate. If*“everybody does
their own part,” that ensures safety and fun,

And in the planning process, successful
tailgaters should also keep in mind the cleanup
process. ' ‘

witnessed the harsh side effects of tailgating
when country music artist Kenny Chesney
played a concert at Heinz Field in July. The
story was can’t—miss news, and videos that

{The Beer Nerd’s guide to tailgate brews

Jackson Crowder
Stqff Writer

If beer is the best thing on earth, then
sports are the second best. Thus, it should
come as little surprise that beer and sports
go together as well as they do. Beer and
sports go together like peanut butter and
jelly, salt and pepper and Catelyn and Ed-
dard Stark. A

Naturally, things that go together well
usually ﬁnd themselves in the same place.
Peanut butter and jelly like to hang out
between two pieces of bread, salt and pep-
per atop a steak, and Catelyn and Eddard
in Winterfell. Sports and beer, however,
ﬁnd their meeting place at the most hal-
lowed of all American athletic traditions;
the tailgate.

A good tailgate requires three things:
meat, beer and an athletic event somewhere
within the general vicinity. For those who
are of age, a tailgate without a beer in one’s
hand is an incomplete experience, a shadow

at all and just becomes a group of friends,
who may or may not have tickets to the
game, hanging out and eating hot dogs.

down that mystery meat, and water is sim-
ply unacceptable. It strikes me as incongru-

beer is meant to accentuate the situation,
rather than be the centerpiece, is no reason
to disregard it altogether. ’
. Good beer and tailgating "can indeed
coexist, but it is not as simple as popping a
bottle of Dogﬁsh Head 120 Minute IPA and
partying. Elevating the beer selection at
your next tailgate requires a delicate touch.
Readers beware: A beer nerd rant is
forthcoming.
The idea of tailgating with a pricey
bottle of Ommegang Three Philosophers
- or Chimay Blue is nice and sounds cool but
frankly, it is a waste. Beers of that ilk need to
be poured into type-speciﬁc glassware and

consumed at special temperatures (usually '

around 54 degrees), two conditions that are
hard to meet in a tailgating environment.
Such beers are fussy, and tailgating is a
decidedly un—fussy thing to do. There’s a
reason that various burgers and sausages
are standard tailgating fare, and oeufs‘ en
gelee is generally reserved for classier en-
virons, right? When choosing a good beer

The next chancellor: Public obligation cannot be overlooked

Simon Brown
Columnist

The year is 1924. The fresh—faced chancellor
of the University of Pittsburgh, john Bow-
man, announces a plan to erect a monumen-
tal “Cathedral of Learning” in the place of a
few sparse homes in Frick Acres.

Critics object to the needless expense of
such an architectural undertaking. Some
even claim that its considerable height would
stand in bizarre contrast to the otherwise
low—roofed skyline of the city. Nevertheless,
the completed structure garners national
recognition and acclaim for the otherwise
unknown university of an Appalachian steel
town.

Although Chancellor Bowman made this
decision nearly a century ago, it represents
a challenge that will confront every chan-
cellor of this University: Should Pitt take
great expense to. gain national attention and
respect,’ or should it focus to empower the
local community and the state?

In short, should it aim for the heavens,
or remember the modest skyline to which
it contributes?

A long line of public-university adminis-
trators has grappled with this decision, both
from Pitt and from across the nation, and
Chancellor Nordenberg’s replacement will
be no exception. Ultimately, he or she should
remember that despite the national prestige
which his or her predecessor has worked
hard to accomplish, Pitt must focus on its
primary obligation as a public trust to uplift
those in the community who need it most.

This obligation is inherent in the mission
of any public university.

Founded as accessible, affordable institu— V

tions for the education of a growing middle
class in the wake of the Civil War, public uni-
versities sprang up across the nation as state
governments took a more active responsibil-
ity in their citizens’ education. They provided
the only alternative to often exclusive and
elitist private colleges, which educated a
minuscule fraction of the population.

Though Pitt has survived the majority of
its existence as a private college —— having
only acquired the “state-related” distinction
in 1966 — it still shares in these obligations.

Unfortunately, these mutual obligations
have only become more and more difficult to
maintain in the past three decades, as state
governments have withdrawn from their
commitment to higher education. Across the
nation, states now spend 40 percent less on
education as a proportion of state personal
income as they did in 1980.

By that trend,,state' ﬁinding will reach
zero by 2059.

Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is by no
means bucking this trend, as evidenced by
the consistent reductions in state support
during the ﬁrst half of the Corbett admin-
istration. ' -

When the states loosen their tenuous
commitment to public universities, public
universities loosen their commitments to
the public —— a trend no more acceptable
than the ﬁrst.

More and more, state university systems
are offering merit—based aid to attract the
most accomplished high school students to
increase their national prestige and improve
their applicant pools. This strategy can be
intended in two ways. State universities of-
ten use it to attract out—of-state students to
raise their reputations as “national univer-
sities,” or state governments will fund such
programs to -prevent “brain drain” out of
their states.

This translates to less need—based aid and
tuition reduction and, in the ﬁrst case, more
students from out of state, a demographic
particularly attractive to universities seek-
ing these students’ higher tuition payments.

Though Pitt in particular, and Pennsyl-
vania in general, is experiencing the same
trend of defunding, that doesn’t mean that
the next chancellor should ﬂout his or her
responsibility to the middle-income and
workingfamilies that would suffer from such

spite the badge he was wearing that night
that signiﬁed that he was a credentialed
member of the press. In addition to of-"
ﬁcial credentials for the summit, Wallace
also wore Pitt News credentials.

“The police recognized that and the of-
ﬁcer who was arresting me acknowledged
that I was wearing credentials,” Wallace

. said. “He treated me rather nicely, which
was a surprise because I know a lot of
the students were treated rather poorly.”

Wallace remained in the vehicle for
several hours before being taken to a state
correctional institution on the North
Side. Wallace’s credentials. and photo
gear were conﬁscated upon arrival, and
he spent the night in the jail with others
who had been arrested. He was processed
and released around 11am. the next day.

Meanwhile, his roommate had been
arrested that night while trying to return

North0‘akland,’j,pWallace said. ‘,fH7e had

illegitimately arrested,” he said.

He remembers Delaney informing _

students and parents that the Pitt police
didn’t want to incriminate innocent stu-
dents, and that their main priority was
protecting the students.

I Wallace said that he remembered Del-
aney as a “kind of spokesperson” for Pitt.

Delaney later presented a case to of-
ﬁcials to have Wallace’s charges dropped.
Wallace’s case was dismissed before any
court appearance. _

Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
read a University statement during the
Student Government Board meeting the
week following the G-20 Summit to tell
students who had been arrested that they

could discuss their charges with Pitt po- ‘

lice. Delaney later advocated-with Al-
legheny County DistrictAttorney Stephen
Zappala for many of the other students
who were arrested to have those students’
charges dropped. I ’

Delaney and administrators also chose
not to send students who were arrest-
ed during the protests: to_Pitt’s Judicial
Board. I Vi _

“I don’t remember Nordenberg spe-
ciﬁcally making any statements,” he said.
“I have a very favorable memory of Chief

Delaney, not just because he bailed me out

of charges, but because I remember that
he was making statements.”

Delaney described Chancellor Nor-
denberg as being very active in prepara-
tion for and aware of what was going on
during the G-20 Summit and protests.

“Chancellor Nordenberg was kept
abreast of all situations during that pe-

riod and he came to the site of the situ-

ation to personally assure himself that
everything possible was being done to
keep his students safe,” said Delaney.

“The chancellor has the utmost con-
ﬁdence in our University police,” said
Ken Service, vice chancellor for com-
munication. '

Service said that Nordenberg was in
constant communication with Pitt’s po-
lice. . ‘

Marissa Doyle, a spokesperson for the

’\

office of Mayor Luke Ilavenstahl, said the
G-20 Summit was a positive eventfor
the city.     .     

“We were honored when President
Obama hand picked Pittsburgh to host the
2009 G-20 Economic Summit,” she said
in an email. “With the eyes of the world
on our city, we’re proud to say that the
event was a success thanks to the joint
efforts of so many local leaders.”

Doyle would not comment on the pro-
tests that occurred throughout the city or
on Pitt’s campus.

When asked what role the University
andthe mayor’s office played during the
G-20, demonstrations, Doyle said she
couldn’t recall speciﬁc communications
between involved Pittsburgh institutions.

Wallace said he remembered the riots
as a series of events that “got ugly really
fast.” I

“I think [Nordenberg] did as much as
he could, but rm just surprised, thinking
back at it, that this was ever allowed to
happen-, that there was any kind of un-
clear police action that happened against
innocent students, I mean truly innocent
students,” Wallace said. I _

a change in priorities. ‘ .

Trustees and administrators have too of-
ten justiﬁed their repeated tuition increases
by citing the noncommittal Corbett adminis-
tration and its trademark funding cuts. That
argument only shows that the University is
increasingly prioritizing the maintenance
of its expenditures over the maintenance of
an affordable education for low— and middle-
income citizens of the state.

This is evident also in the University’s
trend toward admitting more and more out-
of—statestudents. From 2002 to 2012, the
percentage of out—of—state students in the
incoming class at Pitt has nearly doubled
from 17 ‘percent to 35 percent. This paral-
lels a marginal rise in selectivity, from 60
percent of applicants’ admitted in 2002 to
56 percent in 2013.

Many cite these ﬁgures as glowing re-
minders of Chancellor N ordenberg’s enviable
success at debuting the University on the
national stage. And, while it is impossible
to dispute that success, it is equally impos-
sible to deny that these numbers attest to a

university that is less and less accessible to

those whom it ideally serves.

Representatives of the University regular-
ly recite the same mantra that any more bud-
get cuts will force the University to replicate
its neighbor, Carnegie Mellon,‘ by charging
higher tuition and admitting fewer-Pennsyl-
vanians. Unfortunately, this warning loses
legitimacy when the University continues to
show its willingness to shift closer and closer
to its neighbor across the bridge in these
aspects — regardless of the state’s actions.

The next chancellor ought to be wary of
this gradual shift, and should do what he or
she can to mitigate the negative consequenc-
es that come with the status of a nationally-
renowned university —— namely, its distance
from its surrounding community.

And while the Cathedral of Learning
still reminds us of Chancellor Bowman’s
impressive accomplishment, it should re-
mind us also of the 97,000 school children
from across Pittsburgh who each donated a
dime to pay for one brick —— all in the hopes
that, when they grew up, they could seek
an education in such a beautiful building,
no matter how much money their parents
brought home. I ’

necessity, you’ll need snacks and sides as
complements. No barbecue spread would
be complete without sweet and smoky baked
beans. You could buy the pre—ﬂavored kind
at the supermarket, but why not put in a tiny
bit of effort to impress your friends on game
day with a customized beans recipe?

A quick and simple baked beans recipe
starts with two cans of pork and beans emp-
tied into a large aluminum baking pan. Stir
in 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 3 tablespoons each
of ketchup and mustard and a medium-sized
diced onion. ‘ ’

If you can’ get your hands on some liquid
smoke, add a few dashes until the beans suit
your taste buds. You could also add a bit of
‘honey or maple syrup if you like your beans
more on the sweet side. Once you’ve created
the perfect blend of ﬂavors, lay 1/2 pound
of bacon cut into 1-inch squares on top of
the beans. '

Bake the beans in the oven for 30 minutes.
Once done, give them a stir to mix the cooked
bacon into the beans and then cover with foil
to transport to thegame. To re-heat, set the
foil pan on top of a grill for about 15 minutes
—— just until the beans get hot. V

Delving further into the realm of snack
foods now, it’s almost expected that you’ll
have some sort of potato or corn chips at your
tailgate. Adding some dip to your spread will
help spice up the snack situation. Instead of
grabbing a cheap jar of salsa, try your hand
at whipping up delicious guacamole-

Guacamole is very simple to make. Begin
by scooping the pulp from a few avocados.
Squeeze some-fresh lime juice onto the avo-
cado pulp and mash it a bit to combine. Fold
in a few diced tomatoes, some chopped onion
and some ﬁnely chopped cilantro. Lastly, stir
in some cumin, salt, garlic powder and a few

dashes of hot sauce to bring out the spicy .

Mexican ﬂavors of the dip. _
The list of items you can add to a tailgate
spread goes just as far as your imagination,

‘ but it’s important to remember to have a full,

balanced spreadlfor your guests to enjoy.
Use these ideas I’ve listed to get you started,
and think about what dishes you and your
friends would most like to chow down on
come game day. ﬂ ,

To invite Pat to your tailgate, email him
at tpncopydesk@gmail.com. He’ll bring the

When Chancellor Nordenberg took the
reins here at the University of Pittsburgh
in 1995, the University’s reputation was
less than stellar. Riddled with internal
strife at the time, “Hail to Pitt” certainly
did not have as positive a connotation
as ‘it does today.

That, however, is another story. The
legacy of Mark Nordenberg involved a
whole new tale, separate from all the
woe of the early ’9os — one which saw
the rebirth of Pitt. One where we be-
came a top research school, dramatically
climbed the rankings of the world’s best
public universities and, most impor-
tantly, made alumni proud to be Pan-
thers again.

Unfortunately, as a sophomore, I’ve

only had the pleasure of experiencing.

dramatic years forpufbllic education in
Pennsylvania’s history. With Gov. Tom
Corbett cutting state funding for pub-
lic education with a meat cleaver, Nor-
denberg’s last years here were no less
interesting than his ﬁrst.

As state.support was down to less
than 10 percent of Pitt’s total budget —
as compared to 30 percent in the mid-
1970s —- Nordenberg was again forced
to work his magic for the University in
a fiscal balancing act that _would make
the U.S. government green with envy.

Obligated to cut costs in some way,
the Chancellor got creative. Instead of
simply raising tuition, cutting programs
or ﬁring staff, he balanced the ‘budget
in a fair and equal way, while preserv-
ing all of the resources that make us a
world—class university.

Nordenberg and his staff used the
three weapons they had at their disposal
to ﬁght the lack of state funding: The

great relationship Nordenberg built with
the city of Pittsburgh over the years,
an environmentally aware faculty and
student body and a selfless executive
board willing to make sacrifices for this
University. ,

First, there is the obvious: The city
of Pittsburgh loves Nordenberg and,
keeping in mind -that the University is a
huge part of the western-Pennsylvania
economy — accredited to Nordenberg’s
leadership, no doubt — it was not about
to leave one of its greatest assets unshel-
tered in the storm.

Thus, Pitt was able to strike a seem-
ingly charitable deal with suppliers,
negotiating for better prices and dis-
counts on the various goods and ser-
vices needed to run a fully functioning
college campus. The cumulative savings
over the years that resulted from these
successfully haggled bargains — over

’ $30 million.

The next initiative Nordenberg and

the Executive Board took was one that
required a lot of forward-thinking and
reformist actions of both the faculty and
student body. I am referring to Pitt’s
pursuit of prime energy efficiency over
the years.

i Undeniably, anyone who’s lived in
on—campus housing over the past four
years can recall the posters of little
fish in the bathrooms telling you to
save some water for “the ﬁshes” or the
posters urging you to turn your lights
off every once inia while and maybe re-
cycle, too. _

No matter how little impact you
thought these posters had on you, it
has apparently been working, leading
to a_cumulative $10.1 million savings
on utilities for Pitt. But an environmen-
tally conscious student body was not
the only factor that led to all these sav-
ings on energy usage. The board made

it a point to physically make Pitt more
energy efficient, as well. Ways in which
they accomplished this include: LED
lighting installations in place of most of
the wasteful fluorescent lighting across
campus, electronic bathroom fixtures
being installed —— which inevitably saved
copious amounts of water —— and the Uni-
versity making it a point to ensure that all
standard carpet installationsincluded a
minimum of 25 percent recycled content.

Although these initiatives led to a
huge amount of savings, the state de-
funding of higher education eventually
forced a faculty-wide pay freeze for the
Universityin 2010. Yet, in classic Nor-
denberg~era fashion, the Executive Board
voted to make sure their salaries would
be the ﬁrst to be frozen in 2009.

Truly selfless actions such as these are
among the reasons why Mark Norden-
berg will go down as one of the legendary
chancellors at the University of ‘Pitts-
burgh. Every action Nordenberg pursued
as chancellor was taken solely with the
University’s well-being in mind.

And personally, I think that Nordy’s
efforts during the great defunding of

exceptional qualities as a person and as
a chancellor. I V "V A V

TAILGATING

the type of waste that Kenny Chesney’s fans
were able to accumulate. But along with enjoy-
ingatailgate, itis irnportantto bag your trash
and dispose of it properly.

A good way to cut down on the amount of
aluminum cans is to go with a keg of beer, if it
turns out that enough people are willingto chip
in. For Hansen, “a kegisthe most economical
way to go about it.”

Vanek also stresses the importance of con-
trol and limits. “Avoid pregaming, drinking

games and chugging or gulping your drinks,” V

she said. Also, if you set a limit on how much
you feel you should drink, stick to it, because
nobody wants to see anyone get sick. That
ruins everybody’s good time.

Creativity can also aid a tailgate. Hansen
recommends bringinga generator so outdoor
speakers can provide music to all who attend,
and it also allows those who rely on their cars
speakers to save their battery and gas. Games
and activities are also a plus: They have enter-
tainmentvalue andaknackfor beinganatural
distractor from guzzling beer.

Essentially, a good tailgate should be fun
and safe, and the safety should come from
proper planning and responsibility. Iftailgatl-V
ing is done properly, there are rarely any issues.

Just stick to the wise words of Hansen:
“Make sure people are tailgating responsi-
bly, staying hydrated  and have food in their
system.” I V

the different conditions when you look at

Berkovitz said.

De la Concha began his project as a per-
sonal diary and soon realized he wanted
to capture the changing conditions of the
whole year. Though he had to return to
Spain to prolong his visa before commit-
ting to an entire year, he made sure to
paint each season continuously. He saved
winter for his return, when he braved the
cold and elements of the city each day, even
on holidays such as Christmas.

“When I move, a project evolves from
the places I go. I did these paintings as
daily accounts, to capture whatever hap-
pened in that day. But I had just a few hours
since light moves and things change —— I
had to capture that moment that wouldn’t
happen again,” De la Concha said.

The Cathedral is the grand focus of
some paintings, but in others it forms only
a faint part of the background, smudged
by the gray Pittsburgh winter. Some per-
spectives have the foot of a statue, a gas
station or a street sign at the front and

daily life. There are only — spotted as of
yet — three cats and two people captured
in the 365 paintings. Whether or not it is
the focus, the Cathedral’s integration in
each painting shows its relation to even
a distant gas station sign in East Liberty.

“I like how it shows that Oakland is
part of the bigger Pittsburgh community,
how the University of Pittsburgh is part
of the whole city,” Sarah DeMaria, a Pitt
alumna, said. A

DeMaria studied history and political
science at Pitt. _As a student she enjoyed
seeing the Cathedral when walking across
the Hot Metal Bridge from the South Side
or walking into central Oakland from Alle-
quippa Street.

“I love the View most when walking
from upper campus during the fall, with
the colors of the trees,” DeMaria said.

For students, the Cathedral serves as
a beacon of light that brings them home
from ventures to other neighborhoods
of the city. Senior political science and
philosophy major Elizabeth Crivaro recalls
walks from Shadyside as a freshman when
the only familiar thing in sight was the

*Cathedral’s gothicarchitecture.

 

   

“It’s the thing you look out for, the
indicator that you’_r_e back_.,to norrnal5:y,’f
Crivzilrofisaiirl.   
abroad,lI saw the Cathledral from the Park?
way. I felt like I was back.”

De la Concha helped to assemble the
paintings in Alumni Hall and chose the
horizontal progression so that people
could read the collection like a book and
see the compilation as a whole, with the
blocks of different lights and different
seasons.

“Looking at the paintings, I have a con-
nection to the experience of what hap-
pened that day, the weather and personal

V things. For me, it is a way to remember,”

De la Concha said.

For Pittsburghers, the Cathedral is part
of the backdrop of everyday life. But visi-A
tors come to appreciate the relic of 1920s
Pittsburgh, which is both the second tall-
est academic building in the world and
the second tallest gothic-style building in
the world. As Berkovitz put it, sometimes
these visitors can help us rediscover that
beauty. I

“It takes an outsider to see the beauty
of an area. This is a case of that,” he said.

spectrum at the University in support
of diversity,” Fountain said.

Novak describes Chancellor Norden-
berg as being proud of the University,
yet humbled that the donors invest with-
out a tangible reward.

After receiving donations, Norden-
berg writes personal thank-you letters
to the donors for investing in a Pitt stu-

_ dent, faculty member or staff member’s

future. He includes the impact their do-
nation had on the University, and even
where he and the donor first met. Novak
said that he once walked into an alumni’s
office to find a thank-you letter from
the chancellor framed on the wall. He
added that Nordenberg has been able to
transform his position from a public face
to a personable communicator.
“Alumni were inspired by [Norden—

“berg’s] leadership. Once he built a great

University, he went out there and told a
story,” Novak said. I

ranked in the ﬁnal Top 25 polls of last
season. The soccer teams may endure a
winless season this year, but the recruiting
boost and increased talent level will aid the
men’s and women’s programs as they build

‘for the future.

On the diamond, the baseball team likely
won’t win another40 games this season, but
a successful ﬁnal season in the Big East has
the Panthers set up for successthat should
come sooner rather than later.

The themes for these programs apply
across the board to the wrestling, volleyball,
softball, track and ﬁeld and cross~country
programs. The going will be tough at ﬁrst
for most sports, but_ they’re set up for future
success. g

Prospects for success down the line have
a lot to do with the work done by Pederson
and Nordenberg. T T

To reiterate, when Nordy ends his days
as chancellor on Aug. 1, 2014, he will have
left Pitt athletics better than he found it. E

SEER

yellow and ﬁzzy as Bud Light, but it has a
deceptively crisp and-balanced ﬂavor that
makes it a solid choice for any scenario
where more than two or three will be con-
sumed (such as a tailgate). The beer’s hop
ﬂavor is present and easily noticeable but
not overwhelming, which serves more to
deepen the overall taste than to add bitter-
ness, making it a perfect beer to pair with
grilled meat. Additionally, there is a certain
mysterious natural grape ﬂavor and a touch
of sweetness that plays nicely in such a dry
brew. At 5.1 percent ABV, Full Sail’s Session

Lager is just alcoholic enough to keep any,

tailgate loose, but not so high as to make
the interplay of ﬂaming grills and ﬂying
footballs too dangerous.

Looking for something of a hoppier vari-
ety? Try Oskar Blues’ Dale’s Pale Ale. Known

best for its attractive and pretension-free

can (an ideal delivery system for a tailgating
beer), Dale’s Pale Ale is a mild beer, good
for hop heads and novices alike. While I
would not recommend it for shotgunning

RAm(fn am: or tut mp

purposes, it’s piney and slightly citrusy
hop quality goes well with typical tailgate
edibles, but it’s strong enough to hold its
own in the face of smoky, often burnt, ﬂa-
vors. Do be careful with its 6.5 percent ABV,

though, especially if you plan on actually '

going to the game that you’re tailgating.
Finally, if you’re strapped for cash like I
often am, there is no shame whatsoever in
going for the tried-and—true Molson Cana-
dian. The best of the so—called “bad beers,”
Molson is a cut above its American counter-
parts, even though it is largely considered
to be the Canadian Budweiser. As far as taste
goes, Molson packs a thick, bready malt
punch with _a hearty sweetness that makes
it taste as if aBud Heavy was scaled up in
quality and brewed by someone who has
at least a passing interest in making beer.
At the end of the clay, these are, of
course, just recommendations, and there
is no such thing as a beer that doesn’t work
for a tailgate. From Natty to Three Floyds’

‘ Zombie Dust, any brew at all can work if

you want it to. So enjoy tailgating season.
Have fun and go nuts, for the season is short
and having a beer while monitoring your
fantasy team just isn’t the same. m
