Pitt grouphammers
away the spring break

Parthena Mosiadis
Staff Wrz'ter

A group of Pitt students may not
have been able to construct a hu-
man pyramid on a sandy beach, but
it did have the opportunity to build
something much more stable and
lasting. _

After a week’s worth of nailing
and drilling, they had assembled a
solid foundation for a home.

While some students traveled
to Cancun or Miami over spreak
break, 23 Pitt students, along with
an adviser and an alumnus, headed
to Wilmington, N.C., on March 9
for a week of service. The students,
who eachtpaid $300 to take part
in the experience, partnered with
AmeriCorps construction workers
to build a home for a mother and
her young son in a neighborhood
composed solely of other Habitat
projects.

Club Vice President Joe Kern
said that on past trips he hadn’t
received the opportunity to inter-
act with the homeowners and their
families. This year, however, the
group met the homeowner, Tiesha

’ Murphy, and her sonland had the ,

chance to work alongside her dur-
ing the construction process.

“We got to see whose life we’re
affecting and who we’re helping,”

he said. “It sort of puts everything

into perspective. It drives you to
keep going, keep coming back and
keep giving back.”

This home will mark the ninth .

home constructed in the Wilming-
ton community by Habitat partici-
pants from around the country.

Pitt Habitat for Humanity club
President ,Sascha Steinberg said
that the club has had a recent his-

tory of working on projects in Co— '

lumbus, Ga., where the group had

built a relationship with contrac-
tor and AmeriCorps staff member
Clint Berry. But because of conﬂict~
ing events that left the Columbus
site unavailable during Pitt’s spring
break, student veteran trip-goers
met withya new experience in Wilm-
ington. ‘

In terms of geographical differ—'‘
ences, Steinberg said the location
sites differed greatly. Unlike the
site in Columbus, Wilmington is a
coastal town. A

“There was the difference of go-
ing to the beach versus playing bas-
ketball in a school gym,” she said,
referring to the activities the stu-
dent builders participated in during
their downtime.

Club Vice Presidentjoe Kern also
noted that sleeping arrangements
differed from years past. While stu-
dents stayed in gymnasiums in the

' past, this year they stayed in a beach

house that a local church had just
ﬁnished renovating and equipping
with bunk beds for visitors.

’ Another distinctive feature of
this trip was the material selection.
The home being built was created
entirely with American-made ma-
terials. Steinberg said this made it
more difficult and expensive to ob-
tain the building materials, yet the
choice was signiﬁcant, as the home-
owner-to-be was in the military.

Steinberg said it was meaning-

. ful for students to work with the

owner. V
“It was really neat to, teach her
how to do some of the work and

have a part in.making this dream

come true for her,” she said. _
While Steinberg had some ex-
perience in construction alter par-
ticipating in a number of previous
Habitat trips in years past, many

Im/estzgdtion ofPz'tt5ourg/7 police reveal: mmut/7orz'zea' accounts

Gideon Bradshaw"
Senior Suﬁ” Writer

Pitt administrators say they’re un-
aware of how payments from the
University ended up in accounts
associated with the Pittsburgh Po-
lice Department that are under
federal investigation.

Jerome Cochran, Pitt’s vice
'chancellor and general counsel,
conﬁrmed that Pitt made a pay-

ment to the,City of Pittsburgh Bu- -

reau of Police on Sept. t6, 2009, in
the amount of $5,675.52 to pay off-

duty ofﬁcersto protect its mobile“

science laboratory. According to

a March 9 story by the Pittsburgh -

UPMC recruiters and Career Development 8: .Placeinent Assistance ‘staff wilt be on site
tordlscuss «interviewing tips, follow’-up techniques, and resume and cover letter writing.

   

Post— Gazette, that money made it
into an unauthorized account la-
beled “I.P.F.” instead of an account
for the bureau’s special events of-
ﬁce, which manages secondary
employment for the department.

Cochran did not have any addi-
tional information on how the bu-
reau used the payment, and said
he didn’t know what ‘‘I.P.F.’’ -— the

name assigned to‘ the account —
might mean. Cochran also said -

on Feb. 26 that no one connected
with the ongoing federal investi-

gation into the Pittsburgh Police,
- Department has contacted him

regarding the case. _ 5
On Feb. 12, membersof the FBI

removed a large number of docu-
ments related to the accounts in
question from the police depart-

- ment’s headquarters Downtown. I

The next week, on Feb. 20, P0-
lice Chief Nate Harper was forced ,
to resign as news broke that the
department was under federal in-
vestigation for mismanagement
of funds. -

Pittsburgh police spokeswom-
an Dia_ne Richard conﬁrmed that .
Chief Regina McDonald is now
the acting chief of the city’s po-
lice bureau following Harper’s

forced resignation last’ month.

Richard said that she would not comment
on other details of the case, explaining that
the departments involved are currently the
subject of a federal investigation. _

Pitt Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs
Robert Hill said Pitt made the payment to
the bureau of police to provide security for
Pitt’s mobile science laboratory, a 70-foot
mobile tractor-trailer that contains a lab

and carries valuable equipment. The labo-
ratory serves to provide middle and high.

school students with “hands-on.experi—
ences with medical research and advanced
biology.” ‘

Because the laboratory leaves campus
so often, Hill said, the University chose to
hire security from the city police rather
than giving the duty to the campus police
department. - a

When asked whether the University still
contracts with the city police to provide
security services for the mobile lab, Hill
said he had no additional information about
the arrangement between the University
and the bureau of police, including whether

or not the University still pays the.police

C department to provide security for the

mobile lab.

City of Pittsburgh Controller Michael.

Lamb, who is currently running for mayor
and whose oflice oversees the city’s ﬁnanc-
es, also said that he had no additional in-
formation about where the UniVersity’s
payment Wound up.

A Lamb said his officewas conducting an

2.

audit to determine where funds went af— ‘
ter the bureau of police received them for A

secondary employment, a term that refers
to outside parties hiring off-duty police
ofﬁcers as security guards. .

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the district
of western Pennsylvania declined to corn-
ment on the yongoifigfederal investigation.

Lamb said hesaw two clear problems
that the city wouldhave to address in or—
der to prevent misrepresentation in future

- record keeping- -
First, he said, the bureau and the city ’

ﬁnance department misrepresented how
the police department used the payments
it received as part of the secondary-em-
ployment program and did not indicate to
the treasuryyand Controller’s Office how
much of the payments wentto the officers

and how much went to the city. V
The city’s ﬁnance department said it is

currently directing all requests for com-

ment to the office of-Mayor Luke Raven-

stahl.

_ ' The mayor’s office was not available for

comment, despite multiple attempts by,

phone over several weeks.
Lamb said the second issue he felt need-
ed to be addressed was control of sched-
uling and other details of secondary em-
ployment at the bureau, which previously
fell under the department’s special events
office. Lamb said he believes control of sec-
ondary employment needs to fall outside
of the police bureau. Placing the program

,,under an outside ‘office’s control, he said,

would improve transparency.

Lamb said that his ofﬁce would continue
its audit of the bureau of police’s records
when'federal authorities released them
as their own investigation progressed, al-
though it is unclear when that will be.

“[The federal investigators] have told

, us that they will cooperate with us,” said
Lamb. “But it will be on their time frame, ’

not ours. And I think that’s appropriate.
Law enforcement should take precedent
over [ﬁnancial] auditing.” I

other students on the trip did not have such a
background. She said that students who have

‘ participated before help teach the new stu-
' dents construction techniques.

Junior Tess Napierkowski said the basics of
construction were. challenging to learn.

‘ “Just getting the hang of driving a nail
through aboard was so hard,” she said.

Work the students completed included
raising the walls of the home, putting the roof
up and shingling it. Steinberg said that the
week was physically taxing for everyone in-
volved.

“We have sore arms and shoulders from

' hammering. One student has been giving out
’ back massages,” she said.

Although the students spent the major-
ity of their days on the construction. site, they
also had time to relax and spend time with one
another, such as organizing dance competi-
tions and football games on the beach. Kern
said that one night, a dinner with members of
the local community transformed into an im-
promptu talent show.

Napierkowski said there was constant
laughter in the air among her peers. One mo-
ment she recalled was when other students on
the trip ﬁlmed her reaction to seeing the beach
for the ﬁrst time. .

“It was hysterical,” she said. “I couldn’t
believe there was so much water in one place.
They had to teach me about the océan and rip
currents and seagulls.” I

THE SCHAFFKBAVIT

When reﬂecting on spring break, don’t
i fall  to productivity fetish '

Matt Schaff
~ Columnist

If youhave yet to complete your aca-
demic to-do list from spring break,
don’t beat yourself up: Distraction
can be a beautiful thing.

~ Everyone from parents to col-
lege counselors to our pesky con-
sciences tell us that if we just stay
faithful to our personal deadlines,
all measures of success and hap-
piness would_ be achieved; If only
we were able to focus more on pro-
ductivity, we could better pull our
dreams into reality. '

A-subject of adulation by West-- 4

em society since the great construc-

» tions of ancient Rome, productivity
has numerous virtues -— though a

they are not all—encompassing. Let’s
be clear: Industrial production be-
gets wealth, experimentation be-

_ gets scientiﬁc advancement and es-

say writing begets college degrees.
Without people consciously acting
upon the world, we wouldn’t have
a history or a future.

So yes, assignment completion
in college may correlate to income,
power and status later in life. But
this is no cause to kick oneself with

A the arrival of any sign of slowing on -

the prosperous path, to cry over
time “wasted” during mid—s'emester
breaks. For those who think this

_ way, remember not to elevate pro-

ductivity too far, to place it on a false
pedestal. Glamorization of produc-
tivity alone indicates blindness of
the human condition, and a greater
distance from personal happiness.
~ As human beings, our behavior
stemsfrom the balance of two op-
posing, yet overlapping, psycho-
social forces: Awill to act upon the
world and a will to experience it.
The productive will writes essays,
starts businesses and conquers en-
emies; the experiential will tours
Italy, bar-hops with friends and
peruses'Facebook. The productive
will is focused and committed, mo-
tivated by money,- glory, ego, guilt
or survival; the experiential will is
undifferentiated, motivated by sen-
sual, intellectual or interpersonal

pleasures. To get a better sense of .

this division, think_' of how it’s dealt
with proverbially: work and play,
business and pleasure, school and
friends.

Everyone trends toward a dif-
ferent balance of wills along a mov-
ing spectrum; you could imagine
the Type iA’s nearing the hyper-
productive end and the Type ‘B’s

the hyper-experiential end. Even

within each person, the balance can
change -— consider coming of age
as slowlyreducing the likelihood
of pleasure-reading or Adderall—
popping and quickly boosting the

likelihood of staring at class notes.

But for these productive and ex-
periential wills, their inconstancy
of degree belies their constancy of
presence. Together, both wills con-
stitute the cross—stitches of our hu-
manity. Thus, we cannot completely
exterminate one or the other, nor
should we try. I

One reason is our lack of control:
The urges of productivity and expe-
rience pass our attention back and
forth ‘between them, forever and
without our consultation. Choose
to seclude yourself for a week to
write a thesis, and invariably you
ﬁnd yourself dawdling on Facebook.

, Choose to relax and watch.Netﬂix

for that week instead, and soon
enough you’re worrying about how
“Breaking Bad”. will enhance your
competitiveness for grad school.
You know when this happens —
merely penciling “project” into a
calendar doesn’t guarantee that
thoughts of your friends won’t cap-
ture your attention at that time, just
as thoughts ofyour project could
interfere with a social gathering.

- One will might take from anoth-
er, but it gives more than it takes.
Extollers of productivity rarely con-
sider the total interdependence at
work. Remove the productive orthe
experiential will, andgyou get some
form of death — either a world

SCHAFF      .

without food, shelter or art, or a world in g

which those things receive no appreciation.

It goes beyond interdependence to mutual
enhancement, whatever balance-of—wills you
might have. The line from productivity to
experience is clear —— others’ productions
_serve as excellent fodder for the experiential
will (e.g. the iconic conversation between
friends relating Hogwarts to the Cathedral
of Learning). The other way around is just as

_ important but often undervalued: The-expe-

riential will provides the productive will with
perspective and robustness. _ -
In favor of focused» industry, people of-

ten discount the goal—undirected nature of
purely experiential tasks: When we laugh with
friends or explore a looal creek, we don’t craft
our words or steps according to some grand
plan. Instead, we let our experiences take us

.where they please.

Far from a weakness, this freedom from
commitment is the experiential will’s greatest
asset, because it reduces the inherent fragility
of productive exercises. Productivity requires
commitment of time, effort and reputation
toward a certain goal, and therefore suffers
heavily from risk. It’s all too easy to choose
the wrong thesis, the wrong project manager
or the wrong academic major (think of the
ﬁckle job market). And trying to solve this
problem with more productivity won’t help:
Commitment toward any productive exercise

implies biases of attention and conﬁrmation,
which together blind productivity from its
own flaws. .
Wedded to no plan, the experiential will
skirts these obstacles. To explore the world
for its own pleasure is_to let in information
—- often transformative information — that

productivity alone couldn’t gather. Consider .

the difference between chasing answers to a
scavenger hunt through a museum and me-
andering from exhibit to exhibit, stopping at
whatever catches the eye. The former wins
you the game, perhaps, but the latter teaches
you'how to improve it for future players.
This synergistic interdependence between

— the focused product and the unfocused expe-

rience echoes the liberal-artsideal: Special-
ization plus bro_ad exposure symbiotically

enrich the educated mind. The beneﬁts for
a computer-science student of a pleasurable
brush with English literature may not surface
immediately or measurably, but they will

_ surface.

The productive and experiential wills
both, in different ways, prove essential to
growth as a human being. These incom-men-
surable beneﬁts ensure the impossibility of
ranking one balance over another.

Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop people
from trying. So if you ﬁnd yourself biting
your teeth at incoming deadlines, cursing
the time you stayed away from productivity’
during the break, remember this: You might
have saved yourself just as much “distraction”
as you created.

A group of women has shown its ﬁmny sie.

‘through two years of improv —— and its mem-
bers wear bright blue tights while doing it.

The Blue Stocking Babes, Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst
all-female comedy troupe,-is capitalizing on
a rising interest in irnprov in Pittsburgh as it
celebrates its second anniversary with two
shows this March. The group uses standard
performance tactics, and the women promote
their femininity with their humor.

“Our show at the Steel City ImprovTheater
in March and our Arcade [Comedy Theater]
show in March —— We’re really excited about
these shows because they are the second-year

« anniversary. Certainly these seem like the big-
gest, most energized shows we’ve done in our -

V history so far,” said Molly Bain, a member of
the Babes. V - A  ' -

The Blue Stocking Babes have worked to
inspire more interest in the improv commu-

. nity. As an entirely female comedy group,.the .

women recognize their distinguishing char‘-
acteristics. ‘ . A

“An all-female comedy troupe is a pretty
unique thing. Improv scenes in general are
really dominated by men, so it’s agreat, unique

, feature, and it’s feisty, and it’s feministy, and

it’s really fun,”_Bain said. The troupe formed
when they met at Steel Citylmprov Theater

' doing developmental work. Local comedians

‘Ayne Terceira,  Kelly and Christina Pow— '

ers founded the Blue Stocking Babes comedy

' troupe two years ago. Powers has since left

the troupe, but improv veterans Beth Fogle,
Tamara Siegert and Bain now round out the
Babes? lineup. ' r . A

The Blue Stockings Society —- the inspi-
ration_for.the group’s name —‘— spearheaded
an informal_women’s intellectual movement

leducation; ,

   

“We were all really over-educated,”.said
founding member Terceira. “So we called the '
group Blue Stocking Babes because we were
just really over—ed'ucated women trying to do
comedy. Eventually, we’ve moved kind of past‘
that, butwe’re not gonna throw out the name,
’cause damnit we took the pictures with blue

. stockings in them. We’re not throwing out

nothing,” shejoked. _ .

musical theater, Terceira decided to tryimprov
her freshman year. In 1996, she foimded the
improv troupe No ParkingPlayers, which still
exists today.

“It’s a way of not being pigeon-holed. You

A Kind of Alchemy: Medi-

The Frick’s collection incorporates a va-
riety of outside inﬂuences into its art dis-
plays, and with its newest exhibition, the
museum ‘draws on the Middle East to gain
cultural inspiration.

“A Kind of Alchemy: Medieval Persian
Ceramics,” which opened at The Frick
Art Museum on Feb. 23, displays Persian
ceramics created between the 10th and
14th centuries. The exhibition blends

' 7 the aesthetic value of

with the appeal of The
Frick and The Clayton
House, the former
residence of
Henry Clay
Frick locat-
ed on the same
property, and at-
tempts to display

Persian ceramics in con-
cert with the local history
of the museum. _
There is a sense of travel in
the exhibition that stems from
these works coming from a past ~
world. The Persian ceramics in this
speciﬁc space also demonstrate how they
have traveled from their native lands to
the United States. . ' _
Sarah Hall, director of curatorial af-

fairs at The Frick, stated that the museum

has a “history of showing ethnographic
art,” a genre composed of works by indig-
enous peoples of various regions.
According to Amanda Gillen, the assis-
tant curator of education and collections

f o r
The ~ Clay-
‘ ton House, the
mid—to—late 19th
century" was a'popu—
lar time for “all things
exotic.” .
“The Suez Canal opened in
1869, connecting the Mediterra-
nean Sea and the Red Sea, and allowed
for direct transportation between Europe
and Asia. This increased both exposure to
and ability to purchase goods from Asia
and the Middle East,” Gillen said.
Docent Ginny McCarthy, a tour guide at
The Clayton House, explained that high-
upper-class American industrialists like
Henry Clay Frick — the owner of a coke
manufacturing company and chairman of
the Carnegie Steel Coinpany at the turn of
the 20th century 4- saw art as a way to
elevate themselves culturally, using it to

    
  

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
  
  
     
 
 

even
the playing field b e -
tween them and the reﬁned European gen-
try. She explained that rich Pittsburgh
residents such as Frick and Andrew Mel-
lon believed that “the more people are
exposed to art, the more important art
would become to them. These men saw
art as something that nurtures civiliza-
tions,” she said. ‘ _

The Frick received the pieces for “A
Kind of Alchemy” on loan from the Apple-
ton Museum in Florida, a museumfounded
by the donation of the private -art collec-
tion of Arthur Appleton, another industri-
alist. The current history of these works
seems to revolve aroundthe aesthetic eye
of the beholder, or, in this case, the as-
piring industrialist hopiiig to display his
cultural savvy.

When it comes to video games, I’ve done
it all. I’ve maimed and gored my way
through shooters, built civilizations and
cityscapes in strategy games, and made
my fair share of benign moral choices in
RPGS. But still I play, painfully yearning
for satisfaction. '

On the weekends, I find myself wak-
ing up from a video game-induced haze,

a little drool dripping down my chin,

after yet another mindless experience.
“What have I been doing for the last four
hours,” I think. Judgingfrom all the dead
minorities and scantily clad women, I
must have been playing the latest “Call of
Duty,” “Halo” or [insert Electronic Arts
release here]. "

What I‘m trying to say is that I was
bored, and not an “I’ve been studying at
Hillman for 16 hours” sort of bored. I’d
lost the passion. It was time to give it up.

At least that’s what I thought.

But then came “To the Moon,” encased
within an angelic mandorla of indie street
credibility. An indie RPG from designer
Kan Gao and his team at Freebird Games,

trappings of a modern video game. The
graphics will be familiar to anyone who
has played a “Final Fantasy” game on the

_iPhone, that is to say, they’re unimpres-

sive. Its music, although charming, lacks
the sweeping orchestral themes that have
now become standard in most games’.
And shockingly —— and I hope you’re sit-
ting down while reading this -—— no one
is murdered during the game. '

Yet this game succeeds where “Call of
Duty,” “Hitman,”"‘Mass Effect” and any

other mainstream game from the past ﬁve _

a viable emotional connection between
player and story, the viewer’s emotions
and those of the story characters. 5‘To

together his-dying wish. What follows
is a joyfully heart—wrenching story that
perfectly ebbs and flows, delights and
discourages.  A

_The gameplay experience is initially
fascinating because it’s difficult to char-
acterize this as a game, at least in our
modern conception of the term. The
central game mechanic is searching a
memory’s setting for clues to Johnny’s
past. Once enough clues are gathered,

the memory explorers move to a new
memory. When the travelers reach a new
memory,,they experience Johnny’s rec-
ollection as invisible viewers, just like

“To the Moon” has no bells or w.his—

events or set pieces, which are the normal
drivers of a video game p1ot—line. Instead,
there’s just the player seamlessly expe-
riencing the story with Neil and Eva‘ at
his or her side, a simplistically effective
way to communicate the story. '

BABES

Freedom is-what improvisational comedy
is all about. Although the Babes use a “form”
for their performances, nothing done on stage
is ever planned. The speciﬁc form the Babes

- use is something they call p“The Bronte,” after

authors Charlotte and Emily Bronte of English
literary fame. -  ’

Each show typically starts out with a few
monologues, although theexact words of the
monologues are never planned. This is then
followed by a series of scenes that reﬂect on
certain ideas brought up in the monologues.

Afcerbouncing around between monologues-
and scenes several times, the Babes perform a
complex maneuver called “The Onion.” This
group game starts with one person onstage, but
the scene changes as each performer is added
to the scene one at a time. Performers are sub-
tracted successively after a certain number of
people have entered, and each scene returns to
its original topic. 4

The last subset the Babes perform is “The
Round.” In the subset, multiple performers be-
gin onstage playing different characters. The

  

catch is that the performers offstage can come
in and tag out the players onstage, resulting in
rotating character interactions.

The Blue Stocking Babes take the audience
through a whirlwind of emotions, with con-
stantly ﬂuctuating personalities ranging from
the farcical to the serious. Onstage relationships
often get quite intense.

“You get the opportunity to have experiences
that you’re never going to have in real life, but
you also get to have the opportunity to just say
exactly what’s in your head right when you’re
thinking it,” Tamara Siegert said.

And fortunately for the Babes, Pittsburgh’s
improv scene is “frickin’ exploding,” in the.
words of Terceira.

“Itwill only continue, now that we have two
theaters,” she added. “The Arcade just opened
last month — we have lots of troupes going to
festivals, and there’s just a growing, growing
variety.” 4

Although the age of audience members rang-
es from the young and innocent to the old and
reﬁned, the Babes encourage college students
to come out to a show.

“If you like girls and you like things that are
funny, you’ll love the Babes,” Siegert said. I

During the industrial revolution in
the United States, there was a sense of a
golden era of prosperity and luxury. The
Gilded Age atmosphere ofthe property
and museum ties The Frick to the time

    

when the exhibit’s ceramics were created,

during the “golden age” of Persia.

“[The Frick] wanted to_ give a brief ac-
count of the technical aspects of the pieces
but also wanted to show the bigger picture
and the incredibly sophisticated culture
of the ‘golden age’ of Persia,” Hall said.
“The idea was to show the sophisticated
culture that these works came from, the
kind of Renaissance that was occurring in
Persia at the time.” i

Eastern Wrestlig League a success again

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrziter

After having 10 members in action at the East-
ern Wrestling League Tournament on March 9,
the Pittwrestling squad advanced eight of them
to the NCAA tournament.

The national competition, which begins
Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa, has been the
team’s goal this entire season, but Saturday
was ﬁlled with plenty of other accolades for
the Panthers. Senior,,197-pounder Matt Wilps
won his third 197-pound title and earned his
second-consecutive EWL Tournament Out-
standing Wrestler recognition. Wilps, a man
of few words, is proud of his ﬁnal EWL matches.

“It’s a great ﬁnish,” he said.

Three other Pitt wrestlers, Nick Bonaccorsi,
Max Thomusseit and Zac Thomusseit, also cap-
tured individual titles at the tournament, hosted
by Edinboro University.

Wrestlers also advancing to the NCAA tour-
nament but who did not win an EWL title were
Shelton Mack, Donnie'Tasser, Ronnie Garbinsky
and Tyler Wilps. Redshirt freshman Derrick
Nelson, at 125 pounds, and sophomore Travis
-Shaffer, at 141 pounds, also represented Pitt in
the tournament. A

As ateam, the Panthers added one ﬁnalEWL
Tournament trophy to their showcase, their
third straight. Next season, the wrestling team
will join the rest of Pitt Athletics in moving to
the Atlantic Coast Conference. '

V “Our dominance over the past few years is a
testament to the.program and our hard work,”

SPORTS

tournament for the third-straight time. Nishant Singh | Staff Photographer _‘

MattW1lps said. “It’s been greatto be apartof it.”
But it’s not the title the team is chasing. ,
Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer, while

enjoying another conference victory, knows

' that his wrestlers have their sights set on the

larger prize.
“It’s always good to come into this gym and

comeback as winners,” Stottlemyer said. ‘‘W'm— ,

ning a conference is great, butthis is a stepping
stone to NCAAs.” .

After abigﬁrst-round major decision, No. 12
Mack took on  14 Nick Wlcox of Bloomsburg.

The two faced off earlier in the season with

Wilcox coming out with a 5-4 sudden-victory

decision. ' '

But this time, Mack defeated Wilcox 3-1
with all scoring occurring in the third period
and clinched his second—straight trip to the
NCAA tournament. Pitt’s junior was able to get
an escape and two near fall points to defeat the
Bloomsburg wrestler, setting up Mack for an-

other battle with Edinboro’s No. 4 AJ. Schopp.

After a winless weekend in Tempe, Ariz., the
Panthers’ softball team traveled to George
Mason University to play ﬁve games in the
Cherry Blossom Classic.

Pitt (11-12) won two of its ﬁve contests
in Fairfax, Va., in its ﬁnal regular season
tournament. The home schedule begins on
March 23, when the Panthers host St.John’s

_ uled for 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.

Saturday, March 9

No. 3 Arizona State 10, Pitt 0 (5 In-
nings) . ‘ »

Pitt only managed three hits over ﬁve
innings of play as the national powerhouse
Sun Devils took care-of business in the tour-
nament’s ﬁrst game. The Sun Devils pounced
on sophomore ace Savannah King for six
ﬁrst—inning runs and continued the hit pa-
rade in the early innings. Arizona’ State re-
ceived four shutout innings from Mackenzie
Popescue, and Alexis Cooper completed the
game shutout with a perfect ﬁfth inning. In
NCAA softball, if the run margin is eight
or more after ﬁve innings, the game ends.

No. 3 Arizona State 8, Pitt 2

Facing the daunting task of playing the
Sun Devils twice in one “day, the Panthers
bounced back in a respectable manner after
dropping game one. A solo home run from
senior catcher Holly Stevens and freshman

. Kathryn Duran’s ﬁrst of her career resulted
in the two times Pitt crossed the plate.

I It was once again the Arizona State (23-1)
bats that got to the Panthers early, as the Sun
Devils managed seven ﬁrst—inning runs, this
time off sophomore pitcher Alexa Larkin.
The Panthers sprayed six hits over seven
innings, including multi-hit performances
from Tori Nirschl and Stevens.

UC Davis 2, Pitt 0..

_ In what quickly became a pitchers’ duel
between King and UC Davis’ Justine Vela,
the Panthers made just one hit and only
reached base a total of two times in the con-
test. Nirschl recorded the hit, and Stevens

WRESTLING

“There is a lot of familiarity between us,”
Mack said of Schopp. “We have a solid idea
about each other’s wrestling.”

Mack’s defense proved good, but he couldn’t
muster any points in his 2-0 loss to the Edin-
boro wrestler.

. On the back of a 6-4 overtime victory over
Bloomsburg’s]osh Roosa, Pitt’s Garbinsky cap-
tured his ﬁrst NCAA bid. Garbinsky, like Mack,
came up short in the EWL ﬁnal with a 7-0 loss
to No. 15 Dave Habat of Edinboro.

Redshirt senior 157—pounder Donnie Tasser
lost his ﬁrst match, putting himself in a hole.

A The senior neededto win his next two con-

solation matches to advance to the national
tournament. .

Tasser cruised to a third-place ﬁnish with
5-0 and 3-0 victories and earned hislsecond
 to the NCAA tournament.

Once again, Pitt came up short in the ﬁnals
as No. 16 Tyler Wilps fell to No. 9_]osh Veltre of
Bloornsburg, 3-1, in sudden victory.

The Panthers dominated the upper weight
classes as they have for the entire season. They
did so in serious fashion at theEWL Tournament
by sweeping the last fourweight class individual

titles and locking up the team title.

Bonaccorsi had alot of pressure on him. The
EWL was only allotted one automatic qualiﬁer
for 174 pounds, meaningBonaccorsi needed to
win all three matches to advance to the NCAA
Tournament.

He had no problem doing so, recording a
pin, a 6-2 decision and a3-0 victory inthe ﬁnal.

No. 13 Max Thomusseit continued the mo-
mentum at 184 pounds with the most dominant
performances of the night. The sophomore
recorded back-to-back major-decision victo-
ries, 10-2 and 9-1, securing his second-NCAA
qualiﬁcation.

Pitt’s best wrestler, No. 3 Matt Wilps, had

a tight 5-4 battle with No. 16 Richard Perry of
Bloomsburg.

Wilps has wrestled plenty of tight matches
this season and has become more than comfort-
able in them. He needed an overtime period to
defeat Perry the ﬁrst time the two squads met.

The Panthers ﬁnished strong with No. 7
Zac Thomusseit’s tournament championship. '

Thomusseit pinned his opponent to head to
the ﬁnals and earn his third NCAA qualiﬁcation.

With a 6-3 decision over Bloomsburg’s No. 17 .

Justin Grant, Thomusseit secured his EWL title
and the Panthers’ team title.

“Our goal was to go out on top, and we com-
peted ﬁercely to meet our goal,” Matt Wilps said.

Pitt 4, Toledo, 2 ~
Pitt showed it can win a tight game after
delivering its most impressive offensive

. performance of the year. Mildren (3-1) led

the Panthers on the mound with a complete
game, going the distance while holding the
Rockets to two runs on six hits.

Dylan Wolsonovich provided the neces- ‘

sary offensive spark for Pitt to earn win No.
11, with a two-run double in the second
inning. Soto then tripled in the fourth and
scored on a ﬁelder’s choice at the behest
of Parente to give Pitt a 3-0 lead, all the
runs the Panthers would need.

Pitt 9, Toledo 5

Pitt once again responded well to a
loss, posting a 9-5 victory over Toledo
on Sunday after losing the previous day.
Aldenhoven (3-0) delivered another solid
start on the mound, pitching 7 2/3 innings
to earn the win.

Toledo led the Panthers 3-2 in the ﬁfth
inning. But Stephen ,Vranka picked the
perfect time to deliver his first long-ball
of the season, hitting a two-run home run
in the bottom of the inning to put Pitt back
on top, 4-3.

Pitt did not trail the rest of the way, due
in large part to a ﬁve-"run seventh inning
that blew the game open and left it well in
hand for the -Panthers. The game consti-

tuted a crucial win, according to Jordano.

“We needed this win today,” Jordano
said. “We did not play well yesterday and
needed to respond today and we did. We
had solid performances on the mound
by Rhys Aldenhoven and Jon Danielczyk,
played clean defensively and got timely
hitting.” 7 -

In addition,]ordano also sees the past
week of competition as preparing the
players for Big East play, which begins
Saturday.

“Toledo is a very good team and I would
expect them to compete for a [Mid-Amer-
ican Conference] champjonship,”Jordano
said. “These games against them were very
similar to a Big East opponent, so I feel this
weekend will help us prepare for the Big

East opener at St. John’s next weekend.” I
