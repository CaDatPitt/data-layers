_ The infectiousvpartyi

-— betterrknown as the mashup master Girl
Talk —-— brought to Pittsburgh during his
two—stop tour this weekend has spread all
the way‘ to the City Council Chambers.
Today, City Councilman Bill Peduto
will sponsor a resolution declaring_today
— the 69th anniversary of the attacks on

' Pearl Harbor —— “Gregg Gillis Day” for the

city of Pittsburgh. t
Peduto said in a release yesterday that

“Gregg has become an international sen-

sation selling out performances around
the world. I am honored to recognize all

of the ac 1 hmentsw f of our

Officials in Peduto’s office could not
immediately be reached for comment.

The release pointed to a number of
accolades that Gillis has received for his
sometimes controversial musical styl-
ings. '

Gil1is’s album “Feed the Animals”
reached No. 4 on Time’s Top 10 Albums
of 2008 as well as No. 24 on the Rolling
Stone Top 50 Albums of 2008.

Blender Magazine named the album
the second-best recording/album of 2008,
and NPR listeners rated it the 16th best

A album of that same year.

 

called “All Day,” which fans can download
for free on his website.

Some have questioned how Gillis can
copiously use samples of other artists’
music without violating copyright. ‘Gillis,
who has never been challenged in court
for using the other artists’ samples, has
argued in the past that he uses the samples
in such unique ways that he creates a new
work entirely. '

NIH official to join Pitt

Katherineisandler
Staff Writer

A top ofﬁcial from the National Institutes
of Health will leave his position next year
to assume a newly created administrative
role at Pitt. ’ -

The new position of associate senior vice
chancellor for science strategy and plan-
ning will go to Dr. Jeremy Berg, the current
director of the National Institute of General
Medical Sciences of the NIH. He will begin
his role at Pitt in]uly 2011.

Neither Pitt nor the National-Institutes
of Health stated the duties of Berg’s new

i ofﬁce. ’

Berg’s is the second such administrative
position to be created in thepast year. Ever-
ettejames left a post as the state’s secretary
of health in October to become the associate
vice chancellor for health policy and plan-
ning at Pitt.

Berg will work as a professor in the School _

of Medicine_’s Department of Computational

and Systems Biology in addition to his duties .

as an associate senior vice chancellor. It is
not clear what his class load will be.

A news release from the NIH stated that
Berg formed the institute’s ﬁrst formal stra-
tegic plan, initiated a plan for research train-
ing and workforce development, conducted
reviews of major programs, increased sup-
port for innovative research and fostered
dialogue through interactive outreach ef-
forts to the scientiﬁc community and encour-
aged increases in diversity in the biomedical
workforce.

Berg’s research in the Laboratory of Mo-
lecular Biology at the National Institute of
Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases fo-
cused on the roles that zinc plays within a
protein and on_ processes that are controlled
by molecular recognition. ”

Proteins containing zinc and other met-
als will be helpful for future research on
understanding gene function, according to
the release. ‘Enhancement of this research
could lead to future medical applications
involving disease.

Lap-Band

lazy

obesity solution

‘Lap—Bands are sexier than lap dances.

Oh wait —— no they’re not.
According to USA Today, “About 12
million more obese Americans could

soon qualify for surgery to implant a ‘

small, flexible stomach band designed
to help them lose weight by dramatically
limiting their food intake.”

Lazy much?

The Lap—Bands are currently available
only to morbidly obese patients with a
body mass index of 40 or higher and
those with a BMI of 35 or higher with
a related health problem, such as high
blood pressure.

The procedure — which, according to
USA Today, has been available in the U.S.
since 2001 — involves the placement of
a‘ ring over the top of the stomach.

The ring inﬂates with saline to restrict
how much food can enter the stomach.

The procedure is an alternative to
gastric bypass surgery and is reversible
and relatively low risk.

A~panel of Food and Drug Adminis-
tration advisers recently recommended
expanding the use of the bands to less
obese patients.

The proposal seeks to lower the BMI
requirement to 35 or higher, or 30 with
a related health problem.

According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, a normal BMI
is between 18.5 and 24.9. A BMI of 30
is not far from what the CDC considers
normal.

While we recognize that the procedure
might benefit some individuals, for the
most part it seems like a lazy solution.

We at The Pitt News are against low-

ering the BMI standards for Lap-Band
procedures.

For one thing, expanding the use of
Lap—Bands actually might not do much
to decrease the country’s overwhelming
obesity rates.

In a paper on the relationship between
poverty and obesity from The American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Dr. Adam
Drewnowski found that a healthy diet
was out of reach. for many Americans
— playing a major part in the country’s
obesity epidemic. ‘

The pricey cost of the.Lap-Band sur-
gery — around $14,000 to $20,000,
according to USA Today — would surely
be unattainable for many of the obese
people that can’t even afford healthy

food.

In addition, treating the symptoms
of the obesity epidemic — instead of
the cause — doesn’t seem like a good
approach. _ '

“Experts stress that the Lap-"Band can-
not stop deeply ingrained behavior that
drives people to overeat,” USA Today
reports. 4 ~

Without a change in behavior, it is un-
likely that surgery alone will beneﬁt re-
cipients of the surgery in the long run.

The real solution to obesity is -not
a procedure, but rather some sort of

‘change in health education.

Ultimately, a band around your stom-
ach won’t necessarily help Americans
achieve a healthy lifestyle — even ifthey
do end up losing weight.

After all, weight loss is easily achieved
in unhealthy ways but it is not a true

F measure of health. I

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Well, the holiday season is finally here.
That means one thing — cookies.

From snickerdoodles to spritzge-
backs, the cookies of the season fill
our plates and stomachs as finals lurch
menacingly closer, providing comfort
and warmth to everybody.

But the holiday season meanssome-
thing else, too — preparation for the
next year’s Senate!

I must admitl am more excited about *

the latter than the former, but, in a nod
to the holiday spirit and the accompany-
ing spirit of inclusion, I wanted to write
a column about both subjects.

So for cookie lovers, I present a prim-

What’s baking in the Senate?

Just like some senators, some cookies lack a certain structural integrity, according to Stamatakis

Stamatakis 4 6
crumble apart. They aren’t particularly
sweet. And all that butter turns out to
be fattening.

So too is Republican Tea-Party sweet-
heartjim DeMint. The South Carolinian
will likely play a huge role next year with

. his simple mantra of cutting spending

and eliminating earmarks.

But while this seems like a good
idea, he won’t touch the big structural
deficit creators — Medicare, Medicaid
and defense spending — and cutting
discretionary transportation and edu-
cation funding won’t make much of a
difference in the budget. So just like a

shortbread cookie, he will prove to be '

a disappointment, but sadly without as
much butter.

Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) —
Turtles .'

Turtle cookies aren’t really cookies, but
just a clump of pecans, brown sugar,
vanilla, butter and chocolate.

Their construction seems like a
textbook logic error — wildly putting
together stuff you like doesn’t make
the best cookie. They fall apart in your

hands, and lacka certain structural in-
— tegrity. ' -

Mitch McConnell himself totally
looks like a turtle, but the similarities
continue-beyond that. To Republican

. voters, he seems great: ties to the busi-

ness community, opposition to President
Barack Obama and rhetorical opposition
to big government. But like his dop-
pelganger cookie, his convictions often
aren’t that impressive. ’
According to former President Bush’s
recently published memoir, McConnell,
days after publicly lambasting Demo-
crats for politicizing the Iraq war, pri-
vately met with Bush in 2006 asking for
him to withdrawal troops speciﬁcally
to improve the Republicans’ reelection
prospects. And McConnell’s opposition
to Sen. DeMint’s admittedly symbolic
earmark ban doesn’t exactly fortify his
self-created small government image.

Harry Reid (D—Nevada) — Plain

Plain cookies. They technically serve
as the bedrock for all cookies, but who
really likes flour,‘sugar and some cook-
ing oil plain? I’d argue it would only be a

minority — after all, few see a plate of
cookies and go, “Wow, I really hope they
are plain.” Actually, Harry Reid might.
As a Congress insider, Senate Major-
ity leader Harry Reid is actually some-’
what effective. In public, however, Reid
has the enthusiasm of a wet mop.
Some Republicans, possibly McCon-
nell, even silently hoped he would win,
knowing full well that a, more charis-
matic leader would have made opposing

the Obama agenda more difficult. His ’

reelection left many Democrats saying
the same thing most kids say when faced

with a plate of cold, plain cookies: “Oh. _

That’ll do, I guess.”

Ben Nelson (D—Nebraska)/Joe Lieber-

man (I—Connecticut)/ Joe Manchin _

(D—West Virginia) + Anything your
eccentric aunt bakes '

Family means everything. So when that
aunt bakes some weird fruit—based ex-
perimental coo_kie, youjust kind of eatit
and say it’s good. You’d rather not make
enemies with yourfamily if you don’t
have to, but that doesn’t make trying to
eat that cranberry chili—powder biscuit-

thing any better. ~-

I These three guys are really more like
that aunt than her cookies actually. They
are all comparatively conservative, will
all face tough election battles eventually
and will all do stuff that many Democrats
won’t like. But without these three,,,the
body would be split 50-50, so Demo-
cratic leadership will need to employ
some form of appeasement to keep them

happy-

Joe Biden — Weird Hard Candy

: V ‘V’

This -is the weird, nameless hard candy
that somehow finds its way into mil-

‘ lions of American’swpjockets. But wait, I

thought this was Vsulpllposed to be about _,

cookies?

, Joe Biden, as vicepresident, is tech-
nically the president of the senate, and
as such, can break 50-50 ties.

But with the filibuster making actual
yea and nay votes ever rarer, Joe Biden
todayis just about as relevant as hard
candy. . j _

Besides, I guarantee hehas tons of

Carnegie Museum docent Kathe Patrinos listens during a tour for victims of dementia —— an increasingly popular means of therapy.

Caity Garvey
_ For The Pitt News

When the idea of art therapy became popular,
its proponents probably didn’t have dementia
victims in mind. Recently, however, programs
like the one at the Carnegie Museum of Art_
have been redeﬁning the boundaries of ar-
tistic healing.

Because of the, success of “Meet me at
MoMA” — the Museum of Modern Art tour

program for people with dementia and spe— g

ciﬁcally Alzheimer’s — many other museums
around the world are now implementing tours
directed at people who have been diagnosed
with the conditions.

Yesterday, the Carnegie Museum hosted
an informational conference about its own
program, “In the Moment,” modeled after
MoMA’s. The conference, composed of free
public presentations on the disease in the

morning and a training session for members
of the museum and various medical profes-
sionals in the afternoon, lasted from 8 a.m.
to 3 p.m. ' ' a

Mary Ann Perkins, Docent Program
Coordinator at the Carnegie Museum, said
the program began two and a half years ago
when Woodsvide Place, an Alzheimer’s center
in suburban Oakmont, asked her if she could
accommodate a tour for their patients. '

_ “The rest of the story, as they say, is his-
tory,” Perkins said. .

The tours conducted for patients are very
much like the tours conducted for people with-
out dementia: They’re discussion based and
intended to stimulate audiences’ intellects.

Docents — staff members trained to give‘

tours within the museum —- provide audi-
ences with backgrounds on the works of art

- and then open the discussion for opinions.
“I like to believe it’s a calming environment ,

that is nonthreatening for patients with Al-

zheimer’s. You are reading the art with other
people, and it’s a sensory thing where people

j with dementia feel relaxed — more so than
in perhaps other forms of social activity,”

Perkins said. “What I hope this program can
give the caregiver of a patient with Alzheimer’s
and the patient themselves is a fond memory
that they can look back on amid the pain and
stress of the disease.” . '

Perkins labeled the local program “In the
Moment” because it gives Alzheimer’s pa-
tients and their caregivers a moment of peace

- in which the disease’s repercussions on family,

friends and the patients themselves can be

-forgotten amid the vivid artwork.

Jennifer Lingler, who has a Ph.D. in nursing
from Pitt and is conducting research on the
disease as director of education and informa-
tion core at Pitt’s Alzheimer Disease Research
Center, spoke in the morning lecture, which

Simkin: Food)
for thought, 
or avoiding
thought

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

When you’re in hardcore study mode_,,
there’s a scant number ofthings you can
legitimately justify leaving your books
and notes for. Breaking for food, how-
ever, is never controversial.

Eating is non-negotiable — during
this and finals week, you have every
excuse to procure and prepare food.
What’s debatable is how long the en-
deavor should take. .

You know you could allot a mere
ﬁve minutes to heat up some Easy Mac,
but you could also sort ofjustify mak-
ing baked macaroni and cheese from...
scratch, couldn’t you? Or walking to
your neighbor’s because their microwave
works marginally better? Or checking
first if any of your roommates would
like some — or anyone on your floor, or
in your building or in the. entire quad.
With a little ingenuity, the most simple
of meals can be construed as vastly time-

consuming endeavors.

There’s even an Urban Dictionary def-
inition for this phenomenon: “Procras-
tination Cuisine —— (n.) food purchased
and/or prepared solely for the purpOS3!2,§;_
of avoiding work that one is ‘committed ‘
to have completed by a certain soon-
approaching time.”

With enough effort, any recipe can
be contorted to meet work-avoidance

purposes. Nachos might seem innocent

enough at first — 30 seconds tops to
melt some cheese on tortilla‘ chips in
the microwave and back to the books
—— but to the creative mind desperate to
avoid memorizing the political timeline
of China, such a dish is lacking. It would
doubtless be better with salsa. Hmm, and-‘
maybe sour cream. Or sliced hotdogs!

Now you’ve got a semi—meal on your
hands —- not a snack that can be absent-
mindedly nibbled with one hand.

Of course, you can’t have those greasy
ﬁngers anywhere near yourlaptop. your;
better eat the entire thing standing up at

the kitchen counter, napkin at the ready.
Or perhaps it’s too much to devour solo,
and you’ll have to seek out some friends
or roommates to assist you.

Naturally, nachos are not the only

food that can have devastatingly time-
consuming “If You Give a Moose a
Mufﬁn”—esque consequences.

A peanut-butter sandwich can be-
come needlessly complicated with the
addition of marshmallow fluff and Nu-
tella. The annoyance of slurping noodles
can easily justify snapping every in-
dividual Ramen noodle strand before
boiling them. As for popcorn, I can’t
think of a way for you to expand upon
the time needed to microwave it, since
adding toppings or mix—ins is a seconds-
long task at best — although perhaps
you could accidentally-on-purpose burn
it and then have to air out your entire
living space. Because who can concen-
trate on studying in a haze of popcorn
smoke?

Furthermore, nothing goes hand-
in-hand with a late-night study group
meeting better than snacks — other
than, perhaps, despair. You’ll instantly

become everyone’s favorite classmate if
you show up with freshly baked cook-
ies. Get inventive with cookie cutters,

-or needlessly and obscenely detailed

with cookie decoration.

Peanut butter blossoms (peanut but-
ter cookies topped with Hershey’s kiss-
es) are a crowd favorite for any group
without nut allergies. Peppermint bark
is another easy treat: combine crushed
peppermint and melted white choco-
late, spread on wax sheets and leave
on the counteror in the refrigerator
to harden.

Just because the holiday season is
rapidly approaching doesn’t mean you
need to limit yourself to Christmas
cookies, though those will serve our
purposes here fine. Many of my fond-
est childhood memories involve annual
menorah lighting/tree trimming par-
ties and the corresponding multifaith
cookies.

Hopefully you’ll draw some solace
from your food—related study breaks
but, unfortunately, “break” is the opera-
tive word here. Now put down The Pitt
News and get back to work. I

Art’s curator of education, noted that both
MoMNs program and research at Pitt have
found that art— in particular, visual imagery
— inspires mental associations.
“[Dementia victims] might connect with

something from their past, become more
observant, more social, have cbnversation,”
Russell said. “Really it’s as though being in the
museum opens some pathways for dementia

, sufferers.”"

Russell said the Carnegie tours use each
painting as a means of engaging with the
victim —' an experience that can hopefully
reawaken past experiences. A

“People with dementia who maybe have
lost touch with their distant memory might
see a location that reminds them of a place
they liked to visit many years ago,” Russell
said. “It’s about being patient and giving 1360:),

ple time and provoking association between _

what they see and something in their past. It

becomes uplifting for people.” ,
Hopefully, the feeling is shared between

the dementia victim and their caregiver.

‘ “It’s a chance for the two of them to share

something together,” she said. “In this way,

they can'both look at a work of art. It’s new '
' forboth of them, and they can both talk about-

what they see.” - -

Currently, the Carnegie only offers the pro-
gram to organizations by request. However,
Russell said the museum plans to conducix
tours on a monthly basis by April and to ac-
commodate individuals unaffiliated with any
group. .

Alzheimer’s is a crippling disease, and the
Carnegie Museum isn’t promising a miracle
cure. For those that long for a return to nor-
malcy for their dementia—stricken loved ones

—— if only ﬂeetingly — Russellsaid the tour

is a blessing.
“It’s a moment away from the disease,”
she said. .

Offensive

Kline coming

together

Isaac Saul

Staﬂ" Writer A

It’s an age—old saying in football: “The
game is won and lost in the trenches.” In

“other words, it doesn’t matter how good

your quarterback is if he can’t buy three
seconds to throw, and it certainly won’t
matter how fast your running back is if he
has nowhere to’run.

Last year, Pitt’s offensive line showed it
had the manpower to dominate up front.
It had a running back that was breaking
school records and a quarterback who sat
comfortably in the pocket whenever he
stepped back to throw. The battle in the
trenches was being won by the Panthers,
and everyone in the country knew it.

'4 After losing three starters from that

team, the 2010 edition of Pitt’s offensive
line has had its ups and downs but ﬁnally
looks like it’s come together. The team
has two ball carriers averaging more than
4.5 yards a carry — Dion Lewis and Ray
Graham Graham’s 6.4 yards a carry is
13th amongst rushers with at least 100
attempts on the season.

“I think we’re gelling well,” guard Chris
Jacobson said earlier in the season. “We
got our swag together.” '

Jacobson, who got a surprise startfor

“Pitt in the Meineke Car Care Bowl last

year, has taken over at left guard for Pitt.
In his first season as a starter, he still sees
things Pitt can improve on.

“I would just say as a whole u-nit when
we get down to the red zone, we need the
six points instead of the ﬁeld goal,” he
said. “We need to just pile it in the end
zone.”

In the Panthers’ game against Connecti-
cut in November, Pitt’s 28 points all came
on those touchdownsjacobson wanted to
see — a good sign for the offensive line.

Qfhe team found success in the running
game, with three touchdowns between

Lewis and Graham to go along with 143
combined rushing yards.

Unfortunately, the Huskies provided
an even more stellar example of how in-

“Ntegral a dominant front can be on its way

WRESTLING

Panthers turn

in strong
performances

Mike Furlong
Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt wrestler Zac Thomusseit has been just
short of perfect so far this season. ’
In the past month, the junior has taken /

_ the mat 15 times in competition. In those

15 appearances, Thomusseit has gone an
impressive 14-1,climbing up to No. 9 in the
national rankings for his weight class.

This past Sunday, Thomusseit had his
hand raised ﬁve more times on his way to
the 197—pound championship at the N ittany
Lion Open hosted by Penn State.

On his way to the ﬁnal, Thomusseit took
two major decision victories, a fall and a
10-5 decision. In the ﬁnal, Thomusseit met

. teammate Matt Wilps in a match which they

both forfeited, and both wrestlers became
tournament co-champions. .

Wilps entered the open as an unattached
wrestler, because the junior is on a redshirt
season for the Panthers. Wilps, the return-
ing Eastern Wrestling League 197-pound
champion, won four matches on his way
to the ﬁnal including two major-decision
victories and two decisions.

“Having Thomusseit and Wilps make it
to the ﬁnals was really good,” head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “Both guys wres-
tled hard and won four matches each to
get to the ﬁnals. Both are co-champs be-
cause they wrestle each other every day in
our room so there’s not really any sense in
wrestling there again.”

participated at the open placed. The Pan-
ther wrestlers were among more than 300
collegiate wrestlers that participated in the
tournament.

“It was a good tournament,” Stottlemyer
said. “The level of competition is high at
Penn State and our guys had a chance to
wrestle a lot of matches.”

At 149 pounds, sophomore Dane John-
son took eighth place after a 5-3 record
on the day. Johnson won by fall in the
championship bracket before a 3-2 loss
to Nestor Taffur of Boston University. In
the consolation bracket,]ohnson won four
straight decisions before dropping another
match to Talfur, this time by fall in the
third period.Johnson ﬁnished the day with
a loss to Anthony Salupo of Lehigh in the
seventh-place match.

“Dane did all right for us at Penn State,”
assistant coachjason Peters said. “I think
we want more from Dane, and I really think
Dane wants more from himself. He likes to
get ﬁrst, so he’s working to get there.”

“Dane wrestled a ton of matches out
there,” Stottlemyer said. “He lost early,
but he deﬁnitely fought back hard like a
bandit to get on the podium.”

Pitt placed two wrestlers at 174 pounds
with redshirt junior Ethan Headlee taking
seventh and junior Karl DeCiantis taking
eighth.

“In college wrestling it’s tough to build
depth,” Peters said. “So it’s really good
for us to be able to have two guys place in
a weight class.” ,

Headlee won three matches in the
championship bracket, including a fall, a
major decision and a 9-2 decision. In his
fourth match Headlee lost a 3-1 decision
to Alex Caruso of Rutgers. In the consola-
tion bracket, Headlee won another match
byifall but then dropped a 5-2 decision to
Ryan McGarity of Binghamton. Headlee
won the seventh-place match uncontested
over DeCiantis. ,

“Ethan, as the day went on, didn’t do as
well,” Peters said. “We think Ethan can be

an All-American and a national champion,
so he’s disappointed in himself to be wres-
tling a seventh place match, but we think
he’ll get there.”

DeCiantis won his ﬁrst match of the
day by 4-3 decision before a 6-1 defeat at
the hands of Scott Gifﬁn of Penn. In the
consolations, DeCiantis fought back to
meet Headlee in the seventh place match
by winning four matches, a fall and three
decisions. . .

The Panthers had two wrestlers win,
matches at 133 pounds, with freshman Shel-
ton Mack going 3-2 on the day and fellow
freshman Erik Galloway going 1-2.

Mack won twomatches in~t-he-champi-- - —

onship bracket with an 8-3 decision and

»-=zu=—-rrwiriafjutz uccrzs'mr11cvE!rI:eP'a*t0SS*;*'NlﬁCK”‘” 

picked up anotherwinby score of 8-6 in
the consolation before being eliminated
by an 8-4 loss. I
“Shelton started off pretty good,__ and
he has done a good job this year,” Stottle-
myer said. “He’s a walk-on without a lot
of experience that has stepped up for us. I

" tip my hat to him because he really hasn’t

backed down at all, and you can see deﬁnite
improvement.”

At 141 pounds, freshman Mike Tully
continued his improvement with two wins
at the tournament. Tully won 6-1 and 1-0
decisions in the championship bracket be-
fore dropping consecutive matches.

“Mike Tully also has done a good job
for us,” Stottlemyer said. ‘‘He’s another
walk-on that doesn’t have all that much
experience. He has handled-the pressure

‘ and is very coachable.”
At 165 pounds, senior Adam Counter— .

man won three matches on the day, in-
cluding a 15-1 major decision victory in the

, championship bracket. Counterman picked

up two more wins in the consolations be-
fore a 9-3 loss eliminated him.

Up next for the Panthers is a dual-meet ' "

showdown with Kent State, Sunday at the
Fitzgerald Field House. The matchup will
continue the Panthers’ schedule of ranked
opponents -— Kent State was ranked No.
13 by InterMat. _

“Kent State will be a good matchup,”
Peters said. “It should be a lot of close
matches, and it could very well be an even
5-5 split. But it’s also one of those matches
where all the close matchups could go one
way. So we really need to be able to win
those ‘tough matchups.”

A top matchup will likely be at 197
pounds, with Thomusseit looking to face
off against Dustin Kilgore, the top ranked
wrestler in that weight class. '

“Zac’s got one loss on the year,” Peters
said. “Thomusseit has wrestled [Kilgore]
before and has come up just short by a point
or two. So we think he’s got a good shot to
take him down.” I

Offensive line makes. progress

Reshuﬁled line leads to better results, career days for running backs

Ryan Samson St " otograp er

The Pitt offensive lines huddles up with the rest of the offense during Pitt’s win over

Football < 12

to a victory over the Panthers, amassing

249 rushing yards to represent a ground‘

attack that dominated all night.

The Panthers’ offensive front got bul-
lied in Pitt’s loss to West Virginia, but
bounced back in its most recent game
against Cincinnati. This gave quarterback
Tino Sunseri plenty of time to throw and
leading the way for Lewis to run for a
career-high 261 yards. ,

The offensive line struggled early on in
the year, and after a 1-2 start to the season,

5 the team reshufﬂed the line, benching
right guard Greg Gaskins, moving right,

tackle Lucas Nix to his position and pro-
moting junior Jordan Gibbs to starting
right tackle. '

Gibbs relished the opportunity to
have a big role in the Panthers’ success.
At 6-foot-7 and 305 pounds, he is a force
to be reckoned with when the Panthers
put the ball on the ground. V T

“I just went out there every day and

‘practiced hard, trying to give a contribu-

tion to the team,” he said. “I just took the
opportunity and ran with it.”

The Panthers, immediately reaped the
benefits of the reshufﬂed line, as Gra-
ham ran for 277 yards in their next game

Rutgers earlier thisseason.

against Florida International, the second-
highest single game total in Panthers his-
tory. Tony Dorsett set Pitt’s record for
rushing 303 yards in 1975. .

“The offensive line did a great job
giving Ray [Graham] all kinds of holes,”
Sunseri said after the-game.

Perhaps the most important man on
the Panther’s offensive line is starting left

tackle Jason Pinkston. Pinkston has one of .

the largest responsibilities of the entire
offensive line — protecting the quarter-
back’s blind side. Especially for a young
quarterback, protection and comfort on
his blindside while in the pocket is key.
Pinkston, who is coming off an All-Big
East junior season, also provides leader-
ship for the Panthers as a team captain.
“We have a lot of younger guys on the
team,’.’ Pinkston said. “The seniors are all
constantly reminding them, focus on what
we have to do today. Do what we need to
