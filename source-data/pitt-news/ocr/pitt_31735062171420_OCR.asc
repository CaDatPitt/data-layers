Suggests Election Recess Referendum

Cliancellorlllefends low Tuition

, by BILL GORMLEY, News Editor .
(fhancellor \\’esle_\‘ Posvar strongly believes that Pennsylvania should continue to allocate
substantial funds to state-related universities like Pitt.
_In a wide-ranging interview Wednesday. he rejected Lieutenant Governor Raymond Brodericks sug-
gestion that tuition at Pitt be hiked. to bringit closer to rates currently charged by private colleges and uni-

versities in Pennsylvania.

       

,...
L is "I defend the fact that a place like Pitt has low tuition. because we have a great many students here
who cant afford to'go elsewhere." Posvar declared.

What about those who can afford to pay more?

Noting the “social benefits" which education yields. Posvar stressed that they “accrue not just to the
individual. but also to society." He contended that students and parents alone should not foot higher educa-
tion costs. because “they benefit  -‘  "
but the state does too."

Turning to the upcoming Elec-
tion Recess. Posvar said he
"wouldlike to see a referendum.
with the majority deciding." be-
fore another Election Recess is
declared.
Withoutcalling the Recess “ex-
periment” a failure, he agreed
that the guesses of those who pre-
dicted that “large numbers of stu-
 ._ dents” would be politically active
' this fall were apparently “exces-
sive.”
He argued though. that the Re-
cess will prove worthwhile. if it
gives "a few hundred students
who really care" the opportunity
to campaign.
Posvar's remarks leave the fu- _ ‘ '
ture of the Election Recess uncertain; the Citizenship Information Center appears here to stay. Ph°'° bY K°9"'9

“The Citizenshipllnformation Center can be what we want to make of it,” Posvar said, when asked
whether its future is contingent on extensive student participation in political campaigns this fall. “It may

 take a year or more to develop more clientele,” he speculated, but expressed no dismay at that possibility.

As for student politicking itself. tossed out the idea of “Political Teach-In" to spark interest. He
stressed. however. that he does not consider it his place to make such a recommendation. “Student leaders
are going to have to get things moving. if they are to move at all" he declared.

Asked whether he was disheartened by student apathy. Posvar admitted he considered it "unfortu-
nate.“ He will be able to gauge student apathy on Monday from noon to 2 p.m. when he and other administra-
tors appear at an open forum. “Both Sides Now." to answer questions from students.

If only a few students show up, Posvar “will be disappointed but will not feel the meeting was wasted.”

Stressing the need for communication between students and administrations. he contended that stu-
dents are less likely to complain about being unable to get through to administrators if such opportunities
exist. “The fact that such meetings occur is in itself important." Posvar asserted.

In his Presidential Report Tuesday night. Lenny
Klavonic told Student Government Senators.
"Theres a lot of tension in the University commun-
ity. and its been exceptionally quiet here. Leaflets
supporting Angela Davis are being passed around
and the whole political tension might get worse.“

Klavonics comments reflected the mood of a

. letter from Kent States Student Government Pres-

ident Craig Morgan. one of 25 students indicted at
Kent for last springs disturbances.

Morgan sent letters to Student Governments
around the country calling for a nationwide mora-
torium supporting the arrested students. The date

SAGA Food Service.-i§

by JANE HENDERSON

Students and the community
now have a direct means for voic-
ing complaints and entering into
the
campus food services. The newly-
formed Food Service Committee.
set up by John Vrana. head of stu-
dent housing. and Bernard Kobo-
sky. vice-chancellor of student af-
fairs. will meet to resolve prob-
lems and submit recommenda-
tions to the food services.

The committee as a whole is di-
vided into two working subcom-
mittees. one for non-boarding
services. and one for boarding op-
erations. While these are essen-
tially independent of each other
they are both operational in get-
ting quick results and inlgetting
student feedback on the services
provided.

The_ Subcommittee on Non-
boarding Cal'eterias. Snack Bars.
and Vending. headed by William
Markus. deals with operations in
the Tuck Shop. the,Hunt Room.
Schenley Cafeteria. the Faculty‘
Club. the Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health Cafeteria. Scaife Hall
Snack Bar. and the various pock-
ets of vending machines around
campus. Consisting predominant-
ly of student members. the com-
mittee will determine policy on
hours. complaints. cleanliness.
and speed. Since there are mem-
bers of SAGA management pre-
sent. policy can be made if the
management representative is in
agreement. If not. however. is-

Allegheny County District Attorney Robert Duggan was openly condemned for
his charging of several local physicians with conspiracy to commit abortion. and plans
‘were discussed for an Abortion Information Week in mid-November at a Monday
night meeting of Environmental Action/Zero Population Growth (EA/ZPG I.

The state-wide coordinating office of EA/ZPG met in the Student Union Ball-
roomat7:30p.m.

At the meeting it was announced that environmental groups throughout Alle-
gheny County are attempting to set up a system of communications among environ-
mental groups and a clearinghouse to make information available to the public.

The condemnation of Duggan was the result of his actions against Drs. Fine-
gold, Meyers, and Miller and his attempt to obtain the personal records of past pa-
tients at Magee Women's Hospital.

Dr. Marilyn Goldsmith, faculty adviser, noted that coordinated action is now
being undertaken by several organizations in addition to EA/ZPG concerning Dug-
gan’s “most questionable actions.”

Attorneys representing the environmental group have accepted a case involving
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s attempt to build a major four-lane
highway through Duff Park, a 148-acre wild-life reserve. Efforts are being coordin-
ated to save the park by environmental action.

Events during Abortion Week at the University will include a debate with key
figures representing both pro and con on the topic: “Resolved: Abortion Should be
Le_galized;” movies discussing the abortion controversy and abortion procedures; a
discussion with a well-known gynecologist from the Pittsburgh area on how an abor-
tion is performed and means of birth control; -and a lecture by State Representative

"Gerald Kaufman, who has introduced Pennsylvania House Bill 2393 into the State

House calling for the legalization of abortion.

....Throughout the abortion week, booths will be set up on campus manned by stu-
dents and personnel from Pittsburgh’s Planned Parenthood Center to answer ques-

tions and give advice. as well as to explain the services of Planned Parenthood in’

relation to the University.

Two thousand additional copies of the Birth Control Handbook. which was re-
cently distributed by Student Government. have been ordered and will be distributed
to those who have not received a copy.

Present at the meeting were several members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
who have accepted the invitation to work with and help guide EA/ZPG. A plea has
been sent up for any law students, practicing attorneys. and members of the Law
School faculty willing to help the legal counsel of EA/ZPG.

“Legal advice and legal assistance for the prosecution is vitally needed,” said
Marc Hiller, coordinator of the group. “Anyone interested in assisting should con-
tact our office, 414 Schenley Hall.” ‘

The Campaign 70 task force has been set up and is campaigning state wide for
several candidates with strong environmental stands.

"EA/ZPG is heavily supporting the re-election of Gerald Kaufman, K. Leroy
Irvis, and Robert Harbough for the state legislature," commented Hiller.

EA/ZPG is now in the process of coordination a state-wide effort to have the
supersonic transport (SST) banned from air space over Pennsylvania and strongly
suggesting that no money of state taxpayers be spent on future development of SST
unless scientific evidence becomes conclusive that it will in no way harm the en-
vironment.

Hiller pointed out: “There will be no more massive meetings of EA/ZPG as was
held tonight (Monday). There has been enough rhetoric and talk. Now is the time for
action. Hence. the work of EA/ZPG will be done in action task forces. which have
been created to focus in on specific areas of pollution and overpopulation."

He added, "Unless more citizen action from the community is created, none of

us will be able to survive our current ecological crisis."

Through the efforts of Ralph Nader and others, consumers hav
been able to organize into a successful pressure group throughouﬁ
the United States. One group which has only recently begun to or-
ganize is the Metropolitan Tenants Organization.

The tennants rights movement is one of the recent outgrowths
of poor people trying to help themselves in America. The seven
month old Metropolitan Tenants Organization is Pittsburgh’s own
group of tenants trying to obtain better living conditions for poor
people. MTO is especially active in the area of public housing but
its concern extends to all housing problems.

MTO is sponsoring a rally at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall on October 24 at 7 p.m. National and local leaders concerned
about housing will appear at the rally. Mr. Tony Henry, President
of the National Tenants‘ Organization in Washington D.C. will be0
one of the main speakers.

COT/I Triumphs
With Belgian Art

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
The Universitys Committee on the Arts <COTAv has triumphed

once again with the exhibit of a collection of original Belgian posters.

watercolors and drawings.

The collection which is being shown in the States for the first time.
houses a number of extremely rare posters which have been hailed as
some of the finest expressions of "Art Nouveau." "Art Nouveau." has
been called the genesis of modern art and can be seen in the same light
as the work at the turn of the century. It‘s strong and personal. but de-
void of historical influences.

This movement. with its international avant garde following. was
one of the most influential in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries.

“La Belle Epoque” (The Beautiful Age) in Belgium was a dis-
tinct derivative of the movement, making Belgium, according to Yo-
lande Oostens-Wittamer, “the Promised Land of Art Nouveau.”

The. birth of the poster as an art form was charasteristic of the
metamorphoses of the century. and Belgium as a small. neutral coun-
try was at the crossroads of the continent. It is recognized as a sym-
bol of the times. It was art everywhere and art for everyone.

The posters, which are on display at the Henry Clay Frick Fine
Arts Building. are representative of the daily happenings at the turn
of the century. The fantasies. the prayers. the innovations of the times
are transmitted through the simplicityand sensitivity portrayed by ar-
tists like Privat Livemont. Leo Jo. Gisbert Combaz. and Georges
Lemmen.

- Thebnow famous day of May 4. 1970. where
I four students were shot and killed at Kent State
jlflfllversity is now five months past. but this past
.‘F-,fi‘day"an astonishing and shocking report came
, y -from the Portage Grand Jury where Kent State is
lgzcated,
.’T§Reports read, “Twenty-five students indicted
:f0T, ci_jim_inal conduct, National Guard cleared at
Kent.” It was not stated who is to be charged and
what] they have been charged with until all sus-
.‘ ects have been arrested, but President White of

tion like it’is ‘because of the indictments. I took a
ichance and went to Kent.
 UPON ENTERING Kent one gets a unique feel-

destruction of property. injury or committing a
nuisance in a building. first degree riot. second de-
gree riot. inciting a riot. and campus disruptions.

These are only a few things that you can be ar-
rested for most of which are ambigious. It is a
wonder that the Kent State student can even walk
to his classes. ’

Since the indictments came down. many stu-
dents on Kent see even more of the repression on
the campus. First. they see indictments only
against the students. not one against the National
Guard who killed four students. Many students
feel that there should have been no indictments.

If Kent is closed again because of demonstra-
tion it will be a minimum of one year.

THE SITUATION has become so tense that
some students feel that it will explode at any mo-
ment. The reason may be that a person can think
but not act.

The unique partabout Kent and its students is’
the incident at Kent on May 4 ever happened. Kent
is a conservative. partying school and much of it
is apathetic.

But the National Guard did come on campus to
stop demonstrations against United States aggres-
sion into Cambodia.

saw the repression on the campus and feel it now.
The utmost hope of the students is that their be-

Drama Critic

There was alarm and surprise.
among the members of the Dra— --

ma Department‘s faculty and
students last week. They unfor-
tunately learned that they were
the latest to receive “the Edu-
cational Ax“ as the grape vine
transmitted to them that Central

Printing was to move into what

is now the Theatre Shop.

In fact Central Printing. a
service organization. they
learned was to take priority over
and greatly impede the educa-
tional functioning of their de-
partment.

Perhaps. the most unsatisfy-
ing thing of all . . . is that the fac-
ulty of’ the Theatre Department
were not even aware that they

were being removed from their

urgently needed home.

01-‘, LITTLE knowledge to
those outside the Theatre De-
partment. the shop is a key area.
both because of its strategic lo-
cation to both Pitt Theatres. and
because it is here that- the tech-

./;;i nical aspects of the drama are.

- ,; taught and exercised by the stu-
 dents of the University. both in

tract with the UFWU.

and outside of the Theatre De-
partment.

It is an area that need not be

.re-evaluated. for it is the life of

the technical aspect of theatre
instruction at Pitt. but curiously
enough has;been without the con-
sultation of its present occu-
pants.

Central Printing needs a
choice location, but it appears
that someone handling the non-
academic departments had over-
looked that there is education
taking place here.

THIS CRITIC wonders why no
one is helping the faculty and the
students who pay for an educa-
tion and hope for a future in the
arts. If consulted. they may
have been able to give the other
side for a democratic decision.

Scream about good theatre at
the University and then take
away the lights. the sets and all
those opportunities to make this
valuable s-tuff? My cup runneth
over with praise for the wise ad-
ministrator who seems to have

decided that the arts are subser- _

vient to the printing press.

Support Lettuce Boycott

by MARK COHEN
Staff Columnist

Not long ago 7.000 farm workers walked offtheir jobs in Sal-
inas Valley. Calif. The workers. predominantly Mexican-American.
are demanding a union contract.

The United Farm Workers Organizing Committeewhich pre-
viously negotiated contracts after organizing a prolonged grape
boycott. is attempting to organize these workers into the United
Farm Workers Union IUFWU).

The walkout was the largest agricultural strike in history. The
agriculture enterprise in California grosses $4.5 billion a year which
is the largest single contributor to the state revenues.

THE STRIKE. seems to follow the pattern of the grape strike.

«Bob MacDonald came to Pittsburgh with some other people to help

organize a lettuce boycott until the workers have gainedha union con-

He explained the reason he is town. “Since the courtinjunctions

‘Freak’ Scene
Eco-coopted

Dear Editor and Students-

A great many people get all
whacked out of shape when two
or three hundred long-haired-
pinko-etc. students march about
trying to prevent those self—same.
people from suicide in a couple
quaint little asian countries
where they wouldn't spend two
weeks vacation even if they did
have a Gulf credit card. What
these people (the self-same ones.
again) don't know about is that
these identical dirty-hippy-radi-
cal-etc. students aren't crown-
ing homecoming queens and
bobbing for apples between de-
monstrations.

True. very little is to be ac-
complished in terms of publi-
city without an immediate rally-
ing point. What is more signi-
ficant than sixty minutes. eight
volumes. and four front page
columns of publicity, however.
is the real cultural change that is
developing underneath long hair
and expanded consciousnesses.

Now. these days you see alot
of folks trotting around with
longhairandbellsandstuff, and
the temptation is strong to say
"wow. alot of people are getting
into this freak thing." WRONG!
What is happening is that the
"freak thing" is being co-opted
by. ironically. the socio-econ-
omico—political system that the
new culture so vehemently re-
jects.

Take for example a decision
pending before that bastion of
artistic protection the United
States Patent Office. No less
than two (2) million-dollar eco-
nomic enterprises have applied
to register the good-old peace
symbol 1 l as their very own
original trademark. One of these

But all hope is not lost. as

they are at present. individuals
who are indeed creating their
own social and economic life

pate in violent exploitation of
fellow humans. in-between mar-

sucked into American economic
exploitation.

of troops in Vietnam indefin-

to win a military victory. direct-
ly or by proxy.

An Old, Old Tale’

But Vietnam is an old old
story to the American public, and
they seem to be getting accus-

tomed to the idea of a perman-«

ent expeditionary force abroad;
just in case they should begin to
think toomuch about it again.
Mr. Nixon has his capable Vice-
President in hand to divert na-
tional attention from real issues
to-—shall we say—less real issues
like street demonstrations and ra-
dical-liberal treason.

Those pundits who‘ took Mr.
Nixon at his word during his trip
to Southeast Asia. were astound-
ed at the American intervention
in Cambodia. Mr. Nixon was
pleased. in fact. that he had
showed the world how very un-
predictable he was. and that he
was no paper-tiger. as Hanoi had
begun to think.

Mr. Nixon had had the. oppor-
tunity to see the cinema now and
again, and it had occured to him
that neither John Wayne nor
George Patton hadever made
a name for themselves by hold-
ing a low profile. And nobody

' borders of

/

had ever pushed those gentlemen
around!

Apparently all those lessons
policy-makers were supposed to
have learned from the Vietnam
involvement were undone by a
night or two at the movies!

What About Us

Now it was not many days ago
that we began to hear rumblings
out of Washington about the con-
struction of a Soviet submarine
base in Cuba. and a little rock-
et-rattling to go with it: the Un-
ited States would take “appro-
priate measures" if the Russians
were indeed doing anything so
underhanded.

It did not occur to these gen-
tlemen in the capital that their
own navy had not a few sub-
marine bases strung around the
the Soviet . Union:
rather they seemed more inter-
ested in bringing back those days
of old glory when Jack Kennedy
stared the Russians down in those
same latin waters.

We need only turn to the Jor-
danian crisis to become even
more suspicions that Mr. Nixon
is following an old interven-
tionist script. If Kennedy had his
Cuba, Ike had had his Lebanon,
and Ike, afterall, had taught
Dick everything he knew about
foreign policy;

Dick never did. as it turned
out. intervene in Jordan. but it
was later revealed that he had
intended to do so if his client.
the Jordanian king. had been un-
successful in repelling his ad-
versaries. Dick played a mag-
nificent game of gunboat dip-
lomacy that would have made
the old Bullmoose. Teddy Roose-
velt. proud.

Actually. as Dick sees it. old
verities are old verities. and what
was good enough for 1890 is good
enough for 1970. But we do fear
that old Tom Paine might have
turned a few turns in his grave
to see Mr. Nixon propping up a
monarch—and a bloody mogarch
at that. who had opened fire
with tanks on his own cities and
his own people.

Israel Would Be Better
As Jordanians later put it:

"Even Dayan wouldn't have done
that to us." Nor was Mr. Nixon.
and America's own Metternich.
Henry A. Kissinger, to be re-
strained by any thought for the
interests of their Western Euro-
pean allies whose oil supplies
could have been jeopardized had
the U.S. intervened.

The Jordanian affair is. of‘
course. a doubly curious matter.
When Mr. Nixon intervened in
Cambodia. the liberals cried foul
and wrang their hands in con-
sternation. and we never hear

an end to their indignation over-

U.S. support for the Greek oli-
garchs.

But in this case, not by strain-
ing, could we hear a peep from
the liberal camp. And again, in
South _ Vietnam, when Americans
fire on civilians, we never hear
the end of it from liberal hum-
anitarians, but in this case—one‘
of clear massacre——we seem al-
most to encounter a conspiracy
of silence!

If we find this mystifying. in
view of the liberal opposition to
interventionism. and to “mili-
tary solutions." then we are
very justified. But to look fur-
ther is to find the answer: it
would appear that the liberals

are not. afterall. opposed to all
interventionism; they are only
opposed to interventionism in de-
fense of Mr. Nixon‘s interests.

When the interests of one of
their client states is at stake-—
in this case Israel-—well. inter-
ventionism is not only justi-
fied. but a downright impera-
tive!

What does all this mean to the
average American? Well, for one
thing, it seems to mean that
there will be no “peace divid-
end” after Vietnam, since Viet-
nam may well never end. And
if it does—well—it’s a big world
and there are lots of places
where American troops and boats
and planes are going to be
needed. For kids coming out of
high school or college, it means
they will have the opportunity to
see foreign places.

For those living in the cities.
it means there won’t be too much
money left for transportation
or housing. or for clearing up air
pollution. And for the rest of
the world if they should try to
change their government—well.
better check with Washington
first. The American national
interest stretches a long way be-
yond the 12 mile limit!

The scream of I0,000 grief stricken ‘butterflies shatters the
death silence. The darkness of day creeps along the crimson skyline.
A man walks alone in the alleyway of life uncaring, unwanted,

nerve shattered.

This man, unloved by all, contemplates all and all contemplate
him. He who fights with illusion fears the rays of reality. Voices keep
calling, bidding him to welcome his doom. The pathway is clear,
which way will he turn?

A mindless creton ponders life but what thoughts can such a
creature have? Can a rock bleed? How strange fate intermingles
with the destinies of men. Determination or free will?

Look into the mirror image of the mind. The scarlet red cloud
hungs ugly in the night for all eyes to gaze upon. The question is
stated; the answer suppressed. Thoughts foreshadow themselves.
Everything grows black, the sun begins, to bleed. I have no mouth

and I must scream!

Judicial Reform Recommended

cessive bail bond procedures. He concluded through this study, that
“Blacks certainly don't get as fair a shake as whites in these matters.
And although the sample is too small to give conclusive proof of these
charges, the data does suggest that these premises may be true.”

Adams added that blacks are consistently on the short end and are
often forced to pa_v higher bails. Bail is only to insure the presence of
a defendant at a trial and is not intended for use as a punitive measure.

In no case did the magistrate make a serious attempt to ask more
than the defendants name. age. address. and employment. Only in one
case was there any discussion if the defendant was able to pay. No de-
fendant was informed that he could testify to facts relevant to setting
bail."

He then emphasized, “Although this case involves black claims
that blacks do not receive equal treatment, we as concerned people are
worried also about whites in poverty who have troubles in the area of
bail and in getting representation that more affluent people can have
without financial worries.”

\

“We are interested in people and the judicial system. In light of
jurists and magistrates. we believe that there should be an overhaul.“

Wahrhaftig offered. "Organized crime can afford lawyers and bail
and can smooth their way through the system easier than any poor
person."

Another claim which they believe is substantiated by the survey
is that a black is more likely to charged with a serious crime while a
white is more likely to be charged with a minor offense. i

The survey pointed_ out school disturbances in which whites were
arrested for disturbing the peace and blacks for assault and battery.

A higher percentage of whites were channeled out of the system
with a small fine while a higher percentage of blacks had to post bail.
await a trial. and be subject to prison sentences. The arresting officers
setting of charges was considered of strong importance in the defen-
dant‘s fate.

Adams then turned the discussionito the effects of this unequal
system. He stated. "The system is not responsive to particular cases.

‘‘It is important to note that 40 per cent of those accused of a crime
are later released after a long period of incarceration. Even first offen-
ders are then stigmatized in their own neighborhoods. There is no ques-
tion that it serves to radicalize young people.”

"For example." Wahrhaftig inserted. "There is a case in which an

'18 or 19-year-old boy was shooting crap on a street corner. It is not con-

sidered a crime and is usually fined ten dollars. They searched him and
found a bottle of pills and also included possession of drugs in his
charges.

“The boy spent ten days in jail. and then the pills were found to be
cold-remedy capsules. The case was eventually dismissed."

Sgt. Adams continued by commenting, “Many teens caught in
these situations ‘cop a plea.’ That is, they plea guilty to the lesser crime
hoping to pass through the system more quickly.”

He criticized. “Attorneys accommodate the system and do ‘not
challenge police or the magistrates. The people they represent then are
actually receiving little or no representation."

Along this same line of discussion. Wahrhaftig said that "lawyers

. are politically powerful. As a matter of fact. most congressmen are

lawyers. These individuals should know what is happening. But. they are
not doing a significant thing in judicial reform.“

The men reflected that the results of their survey hold true in

cities other than Pittsburgh. They noted that many of the jail riots in

New York City were based on the same criticisms.

The AFSC and Wahrhaftig are sending a letter to the Mayor’s Com-
mission on Human Relations recommending that further study he ini-
tiated to answer the questions raised by this study. They will also re-
quest that some move be taken to get the magistrates. the police de-
partment and the black community together. They also wish to isolate
and cure the sources of unequal treatment in the courts.

Intercultural Course
Makes Students Own Text

by MARY ANN MARKO

“The student will be his own
textbook,” claimed Melvin
Schnapper, a grad student in
Speech and Drama, in describ-
ing the structure of Speech 783-
Cross Cultural Communications-
which he will be teaching next
term.

The purpose of the course in
Cross—Cultural Communications
is primarily to investigate bar-
riers to communication along
cultural lines. Several areas of
study in the course will include
communications between gener-

ations, male and female, black

and white,
American.

American and non-

Art Nouveau

(Continued from Page 3)

The subjects and style vary from artist to artist, with each indi-
vidual enchanted with a different aspect of the time. The colors are viv-
id, matching vivaciousness of the artists.

Livemont's devotion to his image of women is particularly entic-
ing. His sensual portrayals constantly depict his subject as vain, with
serpent-like, Iongihair, heavy eyelids, and heart-shaped mouths, cou-
pled with a sense of fragrance and touch. 4

In the art of Leo Jo, the effect is entirely different, with her wom-
en approaching evil caricatures. Like Livemont, the colors are vivid
but the soft voluptuousness is gone, and in its place, a feeling of the

The course, according to
Schnapper, will incorporate group
dynamics exercises, in which
students will respond to each
other.

Motivated by a desire to
change the traditional educa-
tional system, the grad student
commented: “Most teachers are
interested only in the substance
of the course, and not in how
they are teaching it. Teachers
cannot really teach; they can
only facilitate learning. Class
goals should be mutually arriv-
ed at by students and facilita-
tor.”

“The essence of the course in
inter-cultural communications
will come from the students,"
Schnapper said. “They will ev-
aluate themselves and deal with
their own attitudes and identi-
ties.”

In Speech 783, optional exams
will be given, but the course
will be graded mainly on indi-
vidual projects, which the stu-
dents will choose themselves.

Although the course is listed
under the School of _General Stu-
dies, it is open to all undergrad-
uates. '

“This course is primarily for
students who will work in multi-
racial or multi-cultural situa-
tions,“ added Schnapper. “But
I would like to encourage stu-
dents from different disci-
plines——particularly foreign stu-
dents—to elect the course."

Classes will be held on Thurs-
day evenings from 5:30-8.

While most of the campus is

DePasqua and the Pitt Panthers
are preparing for the Hurri-
canes of Miami. who visit. Pitt

outweighs them. both on offense
and on defense. The Hurricanes.

takes all season long. averages

. fensive seven and the front de-

Pasqua. "it's a question of-

‘whether you can blow. them out

use finesse. We'll have to utilize .

everything we have.“

Pitt Assistant Coach Steve Pe-
tro scouted Miami and was im-
pressed. “This is a team that is
blessed with an awful‘ lot of tal-
ent. The problem has been a
breakdown in individual assign-
ments. Individual mistakes at

crucial times in their games

have killed them.”

The Hurricanes‘ 2-2 record
features victories over William
and Mary (36-14) and Mary-
land (18-11) and losses to Geor-
gia Tech (31-21) and Tampa (31-
14). Coach Petro. who was at
the Tampa contest pointed out
that Miami suffered a few bad
breaks early in the game that

put them behind by two touch-

downs. and they never regained
the ground they had lost.
Resulting from the Tampa

game._ there has been a mild
shake-up in the Miami ‘line-up.

Kelly. Cochrane. who last year ’

surpassed all of George Mira's
records will_be back at quarter-
back. Cochrane was taken off
thefirst team after he failed to
perform up to expectations in
Miami's first two games of the
season. Coming in last week
against Tampa. he did a good job
and thus earned himself the
starting spot.

Larry Wilson will move up to
the quick guard position on of-
fense, Kenneth White movesgto
left tackle and Kurt Schotten-
heimer will play short safety on

the defensive squad.

Miami head Coach Walt Kich-
efski is very concerned about
Saturday's game between the
Panthers and his Hurricanes.

-"Any football team that can do

to West Virginia what Pitt did.
you have to look-out.” Kichefski
began. “They have great coach-
es whoa ’

   

  Hurricanes Test Pant

hard-nosed football. We're gon-
na stand in their toe-to-toe. but I
don't know how we‘re going to
do it." .

The Panthers have some
changes of their own to throw
into Saturday's contest.

Bill Pilconis. after his clutch 2

performance against WVU. will
now start at tight end and Steve
Moyer will be at flanker. a posi-
tion that he held all last year.

7 Howard Broadhead will move

up- to first-string defensive end
ahead of Rich Oldshue.

Starting signal-caller for the
Cats Saturday will be Dave Hav-
ern. “Hogan has some great

skills and abilities,” DePasqua~

said, “but Havern has proved
that he can move the clubwith
his performance Saturday. You
have to go with the guy_ that can
move the ball, ‘who has proved
himself.” 7

A thing that is concerning De-
Pasqua is the possibility of a
mental lapse on the part of the
Panthers. 1

.“When you do have a great

win or a great victory."'he said;

"from a coaches stand point you
have to be concerned (about a
mental lapse).
kind of attitude you can detect
during the week."

Then a seemingly contradic-
tory pointwas brought up by the
coach when he was asked what

‘affect the “number one” rank-

ing in the East has had on the
team. ’ I

.“When you win you continue to
get winning performance." he
said. "Kids Agetto believe in
themselves. And the more you
win the stronger this feeling
gets."

  Harriers Defend Title
 Tomorrow At Canisius

ZKEEHHEEEEI .

by MARTY HELLMAN

Tomorrows Canisius Invitational in Buffa'lo._New York. will be
a stiffer test for the individual runners on the cross country team
than it will be for a measure of the overall squad's strength.

According to Coach Jim Banner. "There are a lot of schools in
this meet and there are always a lot of good individual runners. but
most of them are not on strong teams. '

Of the fifteen to twenty teams
that are entered in the race. .
most of them are from New York
and Canada.

“Very few teams from the
East compete at Canisius unless
they are right around that area,”

_ continued Banner.

Last year. the harriers came
home with the title with a score
of 46 points. eight ahead of sec-
ond place Lehigh.

Jerry Richey placed second
Greg Rodgers finished fifth. and
Dave Szabat wound up tenth.

Szabat, who excelled as a
freshman last season, is doing
even better-now. “I ran my
best race since I have been in
college last week against West
Virginia,” he remarked.

"I ran very relaxed. exactly
the way I wanted to.” he contin-
ued. “I have a better attitude
than I did last year."

Szabat is not particularly hap-
py with the course at Canisius.
"It is a flat course and I do bet-
ter on a hilly one. There is only
one slight grade in the race.“

This week, Banner started to
give the barriers workouts‘ for
speed training. They ran a two
man ten-mile relay _on the Tar-
tan track at the stadium.

"I was very pleased with the
workout," Banner commented.
"Everybody did quite well~in the
relay.“

After this Invitational. the
harriers have only one other race
before the IC4A’s on November
16th.

On Nov. 7th, they will oppose
Penn State, West Virginia, and
Syracuse in the Big Four Meet.

This will be the first time that
the four big Eastern powers will
compete in one race together.

  

On Wednesday. the harriers
missed their first day of running

“practice in quite a while because

of the rain. Coach Banner didn‘t
want the runners to slack off.
however. so he has the team
swimming at Trees Hall.

The soccer team will lock
horns tomorrow with ninth-rank-

what Coach Leo Bemis con-
siders their toughest match of the
season.

Bemis‘ squad was responsible

for the one tie on their record.

The Pitt soccermen were re-
cognized in the Pennsylvania,

booters are tied for sixth place
with Bucknell.‘ They have main-
tained a 4-2 record in addition to
beating third place Temple.

yet available. but Bemis feels
that his team can move up only
one slot. as-all of the top five
teams won their matches last.

Cleveland now maintains ‘a 5-
2-1 record. They took a double
beating last weekend. losing to
Denver and Air Force. They
tied with Michigan State.

They, also received afgood
deal of injuries in a recent
match with Kent State, but they
should be fully recovered when
they meet Pitt tomorrow.

The booters are still without
the services of forward confer-
ence T‘sima Lekoma who has
missed nearly four weeks of play
due to an injured knee. He has
beenrunning all week but not
scrimmaging. His. appearence
tomorrow is doubtful;

In addition. the booters lost

Whizzes Past Zips;

The Machine is rolling again. crushing the Zips 32-22 in Tues-

day intramural football action.

The victory boosted the Machines record to 2-0. thus making
them prime candidates for the independent league_crown. Machine's
players are all graduates of Oakland‘s Central Catholic High School.

Spearheading the Machine assault was Phil Morelli who caught

three touchdown passes.

After Jim Uffner’s interception,
the Machine drew first blood, as
Jim Cauley threw to Morelli for
a touchdown.

On the next set of downs. Tom
Longo‘s interception put the Ma-
chine back in Zip territory again.
Ross Grana then took Cauley's
aerial in for another score. Tom

Netters To
Play Round

Robin Match

The tennis team will finally
travel to a round-robin tourna-
ment Monday.

The tournament between Slip-
pery Rock, Kent State and Pitt
which was scheduled to be play-
ed at Slippery Rock on Oct. 17
had been cancelled due to bad
weather conditions.

The team willghave a differ-
ent line-up than originally sche-
duled. Eileen Surdoval. the num-
ber one singles player and Elaine
Kingas. the number two singles
player. will represent Pitt in the
Singles matched. Sue Baer. a
member of the first doubles team
and either Joann Kotjan. number
three singles player, or Lora
Dunn, second doubles player.
will team up as‘Pitt‘s doubles
team.

Dr. Edwards, the team's coach,
remarked that the rescheduling of
the tournament won’t be much
of a hindrence. The team hasn’t
practiced for two weeks but the‘
coach is confident of a victory.

“We won't have our number
one doubles team going but we
have alot of deoth. My expec-
tions are high." ’

The team had an undefeated
season.

three conversions making it 14-0.

On the ensuing kickoff though.
the Zips came charging back he-
hind the arm of Walt Kochirka
who hit Jack Mariana for six
points.

After the half time break, the

. Zip quarterback, a la Terry Brad-

shaw, was nabbed behind the end
line by Tony Policicchio for a
two point safety.

This turned out to be- a break
for the Zips nonetheless. Ed
Shelby pounced on the free kick
in the end zone for a Zip touch
down.

Paul Seneca and Al Sciulli.
stemmed the rising Zip tide. In
addition to intercepting twice-,
Seneca passed to Morelli for
two more touchdowns. while
Sciulli played good defensive
ball.

The Zips fought back never-
theless. With only seconds re-
maining. Kochirka took Jim Conn-
lin's handoff and threw to Den-
ny Dedo for the final score.

'Wil-l N ubs

After five weeks of extremely
close competition within the
Yogi ranks. it looks as if the
lead that has been held by
Ed “Quack" Conley may go by
the boards. .

Quack, fearful of his follow-
ers that are _in hot pursuit. has
gone insane.

"Will Nubs nab Naab or will
Naab nub Nubs?“ he said as
he ruffled his feathers.

“You‘re wet behind the ears.“
quacked Zelmo.

Jan disagreed with all of them.
“You are all in the FRYing pan

By ELLEN GANLEY

After losing an extremely
close meet to Slippery Rock last
week. the Pitt Women‘s Swim
Team will go against their big-
gest rival, Kent State. on Satur-
day. Oct. 24.

Kent State. one of the power-
houses of women's swimming in
the area. can always be counted
on to provide tough competition
with its top-notch swimmers.
Many of their better swimmers
aren't competing this year but
they have accquired a number of
talented freshmen. One of the
upperclassmen that Kent will
be missing this fall is Bonnie
Grindle. who is the daughter
of Pitt coach Virginia Grindle.
Bonnie is now captain of the
Sharks. the Kent State synchron-
ized swimming team.

The meet. which is being held
at Kent State. will see the Pitt
girls swimming longer distances
than they did against Slippery
Rock. All of the individual events
that were 50—yd. races will be
100—yd. events at Kent. Butter-

SWIMMERS, WANTED

The Pitt Swimming team
has begun working out for the
1971 season. With only four
walk-ons so far this year and
the loss of three swimmers
from last year, the mermen
are searching for new talent.
Anyone interested in going
out for the squad should go
up to practice at 4 P.M. any
afternoon, or contact Coach
Bill Grant at Trees Pool.

Pitt Mermaids lRea('ily    
For Tough Kent State  

fly is the only event that will
remain a 50-yd. sprint. 2

Coach Grindle stated that the
Pitt girls’ times are steadily go-
ing down and that the team
should be ‘P in top form for the
Kent meet and should do well
in their individual events.

But the Pitt team has one
major problem —— lack of depth.
Though they pulled in first plac-
es in the Slippery Rock meet,
the team lacked the depth to
get the second and third places
that are necessary to win a meet.

One bright spot in the Kent
State meet is that the Pitt team
will have a diver. Sally Phillips.
who will be in the competition.
Pitt‘s lack of divers in the Slip-
pery Rock meet may have lost
the meet for the team.

Mrs. Grindle feels the team
has improved greatly over last
year. A number of talented fresh-
men and some improved upper-
classmen have made the differ-
ence. Concerning her team,
Coach Grindle proudly ‘stated
that “we may not have quanity.
but we sure have quality."

Diane Kase, an outstanding
breaststroker, is the team cap-

tain. She feels that the Kent :
State meet is going to be “one L

of the hardest meets of the sea-
son. But the girls know it and
are training accordingly.”

Coach Grindle is confident
that her team will do as well
against Kent as they did against
Slippery Rock . . . if not better.
Her comment on the Slippery
Rock match was. “My girls sur-
prised me with how hard they
swam and fought for a win at

Slippery Rock. Every_one's times *

dropped and they were really up
for the meet."

A shaver that shaves as close or closer than
the new platinum and chromium blades.

99 men tested our Norelco Tripleheader
35T against these new blades. Each shaved
one side of his face with a blade and the
other with the Tripleheader. Our three ﬂoat-
ing heads followed the curves of their faces.
And our eighteen rotary blades shaved in
every direction at once (that’s the way
beards grow).

Blades can’t do all this. They're straight.
And that’s why seven out of ten men said
the T7'2'pleheade1' shaved them as close or
close?‘ than the new blades.

What’s more, the Tripleheader has a
