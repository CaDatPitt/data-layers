Stressing the idealistic and spiritual '

concepts of the University in relation
to the service it must perform, Dr-.
John G. Bowman, Chancellor, opened
the first SFA dinner meeting held at
the PAA annex Tuesday evening.

Dr. Bowman expressed his appre-
ciation to the members of the assem-
bly for the assistance they have given
him, and pointed out the Work they
can do toward leading the student
body toward a fuller appreciation of
the meaning of the University. '

Following Dr. Bowman's address.
William Schenck, BA37, president of
the assembly, formally opened the
twice-postponed meeting by describ-
ing the work of his executive oom-

' mittee.

Following this report, D. C. Schultz,

BA38, chairman of the social commit-» '

tee, introduced the question of a
clean-up or “house” committeﬁ After
some discussion, the_ matter was re-
ferred back to the social committee.
Plan Unique Stunts
Theodore W, Biddle, assistant dean
of men, reported on the progress
made by the demonstrations block,
and showed sketches of stunts planned

i for this and succeeding Saturdays. In-.

cluded are '3 Cathedral. a prancing
panther which. so Mr. Biddle. sears.
will “wag its tail,” a divided PI-TT-
color and yell combination, and a
panther head whose tongue will actu-
ally “lick its chops,” given the occa-
sion.

Reporting for the concert hour and
book chats committee, William Stark,
C38, stated that his group is prepared
to begin with a concert featuring the
Cardwell singers. This initial effort
will be held November 18 at 3:30
o’clock in Room 1317, Cathedral.

Subsequent concerts and lectures
will be held on December, 2 and 16 at
the same hour. Present plans call for
one of these hours every second
Wednesday, after the beginning of
the second semester.

The assembly will meet next on
Tuesday evening, November 10.

News To Conduct
Second Vote Poll
New Check On Student Vote

Will Be Conducted Next
Week On Campus

To determine the movement of stu-
dent sentiment regarding Presidential
candidates, The News will follow up
its poll of last week with another, to
be conducted next week. The results
will be published by the Pittsburgh
Press’ “America Speaks” on Novem-
ber 1, and The News will announce
results on November 2.

iAs in the last poll, The News will
attempt to maintain a ratio of ten
per cent in all undergraduate schools.

_Contrary to the opinions of many
skeptics concerning the last poll and
its accuracy, ﬁnal results of The Pan-
ther poll indicate that The News poll
was decidedly accurate.

.Although The News polled only ten
per cent of the undergraduate body,
and The Panther polled all second
hour classes and secured over four
times as many votes, the results of
both were very similar.

Throughout the entire poll of both
publications, the results in no instance
varied in excess of ten per cent. Most
of the variations can be explained by
the different methods of polling.

Keith‘ Sward To Begin
New Lecture. Series

 

"Dr. Keith Sward, former professor
of psychology at PCW and at present
afmember of the. Committee on Indus-
trial Organization, begins a series of
lectures centering on the gen_e.ra_1
topic, “What’s Happening Today,” to
be given in the auditorium of the YM-
WHA on Belleﬁeld Avenue. The lec-
ture begins at 2 o’clock today and is
free to the public. ‘ ‘

Dr. Sward has chosen “Middle Class
Values” as the subject for, this after-
noon’s talk. He will probably review
the status of the middle class in the
countries of Europe and in the United
States.

STGRZDOM

HO LAST YEAR this time. as a Sophomore, was showing the

_ boys in the East just how that ball is carried over the ﬁnal
chalk line. “Pat” led the East and the entire nation in scoring at
various stages of 1ast'year’s campaign. Hailing from East Chicago,
Illinois, the “boy with the piano legs” scored every Pitt point, six
of ’em, when he plunged three yards for the score at South Bend

last year. He’s had a slow start,

but he still has plenty of timejto

show “the boys” they weren't wrong , , . Let's hope he shows them
just that tomorrow against a team from “back home,” those ﬁghting

Irish.

Presidential Candidate
Airs Campaign Vie

 

Norman Thomas, Socialist
Representative, Warns
Of Fascism, Crisis

By Irving Bennett

A presidential candidate came to
town Tuesday night. He doesn't
think Roosevelt is better or worse
than Land-on, he calls Lemke an un-
scrupulous politician, and he thinks
that Earl Browder is not so good,
either. V

Norman Thomas is the Socialist
Party candidate for president -of the
United States. He’s a tall man, tow-
ering well over six feet. His "hair is
gray and thin. When he talks, Mr.
Thomas sinks his chin in, his eyes
ﬂash, and his arms move easily and
powerfully with his points.

Fascism In Ten Years

If conditions do n-ot change ma-
terially, he says, we will have fas-
cism within ten years. Present re-
covery trends may last for two, or
even four or ﬁve years, before an-
other crisis sets in, Thomas believes.

The Socialist candidate comes out
strong for industrial unions, but says
he fears that the CIO may be dis-
rupted by internal troubles. ;As for
a Farm-er-Labor party, Mr. Thomas
believes it the only real hope of the
future. However, he does not be-

That's what Panthers sup-

Notre Dame come a»-knocking
for the Panther’s skin in one of the
high spots on the 1936 football cal-

Anything with Notre Dame, Irish,
or Rambler in it has meant bad news
for Pitt athletic teams in the past
year and one-halt. and when you put
John “Little Clipper” Smith, Du-
quesne Coach, in with the above
terms, you still get an aroma of
Notre Dame, and more bad news.

A full house of football fans will
watch Dr. Suthez-land's Pitt grid stal-
warts attempt to trump the Irish
haunters, and the array of talent that
Coach Elmer Layden has at his use
makes the outlook for breaking that
spell all the more dismal.

Last year out at South Bend the
“breaks” were all in favor of the
Ramblers, and the ﬁnal score read 9

should appreciate, a gold" Cathedral

Break That Jinx!

HERE COMES A TIME when even the most pleasant things

must stop. It has been exceedingly pleasant for a not-too-remote
South Bend institution to grind a well-aimed heel into the appar-
ently prostrate form of one Panther, a Smoky one from Pittsburgh.
Yes, the Panther did protest, and even howl a bit at such rough
treatment. Last fall, in fact, it looked like the Panther had just the
wrong twist in its tail. It looked to Pitt folk as if the big cat would
surely rip through its Irish over-lords. This was not to be, how-
ever, for a Mr. Peters let fly a well-aimed kick and the Cat went
screaming to defeat, 9-6. The feline and Mother O’Grady’s boys

transferred their feud to the hills, to the gym, to the track, yes

even to the links. But still the Panther came back, with tail ’a
draggin’ in defeat. This went on until the string has reached the un-
believable proportions of nine consecutive athletic setbacks.

Pitt has not won a sports contest from Notre Dame since the
track team triumphed in the 1935 CIC championships, with Notre
Dame in the runner-up position. _

This is not a'.pleasarit situation, nor a healthy one, for Pitt at
least. Pitt’s teams have played hard in the past, but not nearly so
hard as the boys onthe other side of the line, as evidenced by the
ﬁnal scores. It is not that the Panthers cannot score over the South

‘ Bends, for the football team did it three years in a row, as did the

cagers not so long ago. ; 3

Tomorrow, Pitt Stadium will liave its first capacity crowd since
the West"Point Cadets marched into town late last fall. Those same
Soldiers marched home with plenty of Pitt touchdowns “to remem-
ber the boys by.” Tomorrow another Pitt eleven is ready to ‘give
another capacity audience another big taste of Pitt football at its
best. Last spring everyone in these parts was pretty much con-
vinced that there was only one alternative concerning the South
Bend situation. In six words they said “Knock Hell Out of Notre
Dame.” In three words we say it more simply, “Break That Jinx!”

fresh. When Sebastian dashed the
Notre Dame ‘myth’ from the collegi-

ate turf late in 1932, after Pitt had
trailed in ﬁrst downs, 14-1, and after
Bobby Hog-an ha-d kicked historically
from the shadows of his own goal
posts 80 yards in the air, a fresh live
chapter was written.

Two years later Pitt power lived
up to all its early predictions, hand-
ing out a sound trouncing, 19-0.
However, previous to the Sebastian
dash of 1932, Schwartz, Savoldi,
Brill, Mullins, Koken, and Carideo
immortalized Notre Dame football of
that period by the astounding 35-19
count.

On Carter ﬁeld, South Bend, Notre
Dame repeated its previous year’s
victory in 1931, this time 25-12,
thanks to Marchy Schwartz. How-
ever, two years later the score was
evened, again through the efforts of
the “Sharon Express,” Mike Seb-as-
tian, by a count of 14-0. Last y-ear
when Pitt victory hopes petered out
in the last two minutes, via the toe
of Marty Peters, brilliant end, the
modern seri-es was evened once more,
making the standing three-all.

Panthers Set To Reverse.-
Last Seasons Defeat
By Green Wave

Then in the second quarter with
Pitt leading by a six—pointer, Greene’s

the Ramblers the ball deep in Pitt
territory. Notre Dame tied the SC0I'e-

the Panthers on their heels in the sec-
ond half, a runback of 3 Punt by
Shakespeare gave the South Benders

the pigskin in Blue and Gold teI‘l‘i- _

a ﬁeld goal to seal Pittsburgh’s fate.
Comparing the records of the two
teams would give the Laydenites a
slight advantage. Notre Dame opened
against the Tartans, coming through
With a 21-7_ victory. Following that
Washington University of St. Louis,
Missouri, gave the Ramblers a good

last Saturday it was 27 for Notre
Dame, 0 for Wisconsin.

They. Got Something There!

Hard blocking, fancy ball carrying.
and oodles and oodles of strong re-.
serves were the potent factors in the
three triumphs for the Irish.

For the Panthers it was smooth
sailing the ﬁrst three games and then
—-the Duqueane debacle. Now the
Pitt lads ﬁnd themselves in. the posi-
tion. of underdog and ready to re-
bound, they hope, at Notre Dam.e"8
expense.

Having had a bad taste of the
Rockne system last S.a.tu.1rday. the
Panthers hope to even up scores with
that -system.

The Shakespeares and the Peters
are gone from the South Bend insti-
tution,. but that d-oeEm’t: seem to make
much difference. Coach Layden used
about 65 players against Wisconsin
last Saturday and didn't have much
trouble bowling over the Badgers.

According to pre-game reports,
Layden will start Joe O’Neill and Joe
Zwers at ends. O’Neill has stood out
in the three games so far and bids
fair to step into the shoes of last
year's Wayne Millner.

At tackles Bill Steinkemper and
Art Cronin are paired, and Captain
Johnny Lauter and Joe Kuharich, at
guards, ﬂank Fred Mundee at cen-
ter. Replacements three-deep back
up this forward wall.

That Man Danbom!

Notre Dame’s backﬁeld will be
made up by Andy Puplis at the sig-
nal-calling post, Bob Wilke and Vic
Wojckhovski at halfbacks, and Larry
Danbom at fullback. Danbom and
Wilke have sparkled thus far this
season, both being fast, shifty run-
ners.

For Pitt, Bill Daddio and Fabian
Hoffman, sophomores, appear to have
the starting berths, with Tony Matis_i
-and Ave Daniel-l lining up at tackles.
‘This quartet has a man-sized job
-ahead of it, mainly because the Irish
are famous for terriﬁc end sweeps
and powerhouse oﬂ’-tackle plays.

The center trio will be composed of
Biff Glassford, Henry Adams, and Al
Lezouski. Lezouski, a sophomore, will
take over Dalle Tezze’s duties at right
guard.

Johnny Michelosen or John Chick-
erneo will be Coach Sutherland’s
choice for quarterback, the latter’s
work at blocking having been of high
-order of late. Marshall Goldberg and
Bobby LaRue will team up at half-
backs, and Bill Stapnlis will handle
the line plunging duties.

The kick-off is slated for 2
«o’clock, and “Irish and pray that Pitt
will win.” '

Junior Varsity
Opens Harrier
Season Today

 

Instead of being concerned with
the question of how to best run their
race tomorrow, Coach 0..lson’s. var-
sity cross-country. team is wondering
whether or not they'll even be run-

ning tomorrow. The answer lies in,

the vest pocket. of Carl Olson, Where
a. telegram from Michigan State
should be deposited. That telegram,
if it has arrived, will either schedule
a meet with Michigan State Satur-
day morning or leave the Pitt slate
OPEII.

Originally, as a preview to the Irish
football game. Pitt bad scheduled the
harriers of Notre Dame for a cross-

country duel at Schenley Park. Word-

from Notre Dame last week cancelled
the arrangements. Cross-country has
been scratched oil‘ the Notre Dame
competitive athletic records.

Olson attempted to card a meet
with Michigan State, national cross-
country champions of the past three
years. Negotiations have not, as yet,
been completed. If the meet does not
go through, as there is about a 50-50
chance it won’t, the Pitt cross-country

team will spend Saturday morning

resting for a. strenuous session of
cheering at the afternoon’s great grid-
iron show.

The fact that the varsity is pon-

dering over the question, “To meet .

or not to meet” is not going to stand
in the way of another part of Coach
Olson’s country scouring squad from
Seeing action. Today at 4:30. the Ju-
nior Varsity runs against Bethany,

Although Bethany is not 3 new-
comer to Pitt cross-country competi-
tion this year, having been beaten
15-40 on October 17 at Bethany by
the Panther Varsity, this will be the
ﬁrst meet of the year for the Panther
Jayvee outﬁt. Members of this team
who will be right in there running
today are Lucien Cilletti, Nick Angel-
necia, Charles Radi, R. G. Follette,
Elliot Montroll, James Filson and En-
gene Powers.

Perkins To Speak
Frances Perkins, secretary of labor,
will present the Democratic view at

Monday's meeting of Community Fo-

rum to be held in Schenley High
School, at 8:15 o'clock. Miss Perkins
will speak on “The Issues at Stake in
the Present Labor Situation.”

SWi.t.ch_e_d. To Start,i,ng
Positions For Cubs

Eager to get in the victory column,
the Panther-I Cub football te.am.. after
tasting defeat at the hands of the
Plaid, are set to meet the strong Kiski
eleven at Saltsburg this afternoon.

Last year after leading the Kiski
gridd.-ers for two quarters, the Pan-
ther y-earlings ﬁnished at the tail end
of a 12-6 score. Goldberg tallied the
ﬁrst touchdown in this game with a
65-yard gallop around. end, but the
score was later tied by the Kiski ag-
gregation. A fumble by the Pan-
thers in the second half gave the

prep school lads the break needed
to push over the winning, tglly.

Coach Milligan has shifted his
starting lineup for the battle with
Kiski. At the end positions. are slated
Farkus and Dickinson, who played a
bang-up game against the Plebes.
Kristufek replaces Foltz at the one
tackle berth, while Hafer. will be
found at the other tackle position.
Klein and Kapurka will break into
the opening lineup. for the ﬁrst time,
ﬂanking Etze, who will bolster the
center of the line.

In the Panther backﬁeld Kish will
remain at the signal post as a result
of his excellent punting and back-
ing up the line in last week’s affair.
At halfbacks, Cassiano and Peace will
share the ball-carrying duties along
with Brundzo, at fullback, who will

do the line plunging.

Thomas Talks

(Continued from Page 1)

lieve that the trend should be towards
a Farmer-Labor party for its owm
sake.
he will concentrate on his party, and
use the Farmer-Labor party if it does
arise.

Roosevelt, Landon, Browder, and
Lemke, are treated by Mr. Thomas
with equal wit and causticity.
a tipsy man in a crowd, Thomas
throws his barbs at all of the candi-
dates. When he smiles, he does so
with a combination of the poise of
Mr. Roosevelt and the shyness of Mr.
Landon. His humor is m-ore evident
than his opponents’.

Hits" Back At Critics

Mr. Thomas calls the suggestion
that he is favoring Landon in this
campaign a “typical Communist
trick.” He sees little improvement
in Roosevelt over Landon. Roose-
velt’s reelection campaign he com-
pare-s to a doctor looking at his pa-
tient in one light, an-d remarking how
much better the patient looks.

Lemke and Coughlin in Mr. Thom-
as’ eyes are d-emagogic politicians.
H-e discounts Lemk-e’s importance in
national politics, but thinks that a
Father Coughl-in type can be the
leader of a fascist movement in the
United States.

Asked what he would do if elected,
the Socialist points to his program.
In contrast to the present large army
and navy appropriation, Mr. Th-omas
would work for disarmament. He
wants appropriations for defense only,
saying the present policy is likely to
embroil us in trouble with Japan.

Socialists, according to Mr. Thom-
as, would aid students through an
American,Youth Act. The present
NYA is bad, better than nothing, he
says, and totally inadequate. - Such
movements as the Student S-trike
have his whole-hearted approval, he
declares.

College Students Not Liberal

Norman Thomas doesn’t ﬁnd col-
lege students extremely liberal. The
large majority, he believes, have no
strong feelings on the great questions
of today. He believes that there is
a minority which is vitally interested
in the problems, and will play an im-
portant part in the events of the
next few years.

For a minute Mr. Thomas sinks
back in his chair. His wife, a little,
gray—haire~d wo-man, jogged his elbow.
“We’ve got to train to make, Nor-
man.” The presidential candidate
looks up. He says that this is the
fourth presidential race for him.
Twice he ran for governor of New
York, and once for mayor of New
York City, always as a Socialist. He
was a minister for several years after
graduation from Princeton Univer-
'§itY» but quit that to preach Social-
ism.

Norman Thomas seems to regard
it as ‘highly improbable that he will
lead the Socialist party to power in
the United States. But he sweeps
his arms resignedly, and says that he
is doing what he can to prevent fas-
cism sweeping the United States.

Students Assemble

(Continued from Page 1)

will whoop its way down from Alumni
Hall starting at 11:30 o’clock.

While no deﬁnite arrangements
have been made to seat students
from certain schools together, it is
expected that the traditional Dent-
Engineer cheering contest will rage
as usual. The Dents will probably
swoop down on Alumni Hall at about

to Memorial Hall where they will oc-
cupy the right hand balcony.

Engineers Lay Devious Plans

When asked how the Engineers
would get together, William Mc-
Quade, CE37, said, “We’ll all get to-
gether at the Engineers’ dance to-
night.”

(Ed. Note—-He said more too but
we’ll leave that for another part of
the paper.)

College and Business Administra-
tion students will not be caught in
the middle of any cheering barrage
this time, said William Schenck,
BA37, chairman of the executive
committee of the Student-Faculty
Association. “The newly formed
cheering block will hold its own and
perhaps outdo the Dental chanters.”

“If the enthusiasm shown by the
University students is any indication
of the pep to be shown by the team_
tomorrow, Notre Dame is due for
nasty b-eating,” McKenna said today.
“This Pep Meeting. will outdo any-
thing ever seen on the campus before

All Decked Out!

by beulah

No-tre Dame is on its way to try to
make a good showing at the game to-
morrow, but in the interim “Our
Lady” should be on her way to make
a better showing for herself at the
game. .

I know of no better way than ‘to be
“All Decked Out” in a new ‘sport
dress. This clever sport dress is made
of natural color cashmere, trimmed
with British tan leather straps at the
neckline and is belted in the same
color. But, that’s not all.

These three straps buckle at the
neckline by means of three shining
gold buckles plus a buckle at the
belt. A brown printed scarf keeps
your neck warm in addition to adding
that certain something of color.
Coming to the skirt we ﬁnd a group
of ﬁve pleats on each side and no
pleats to “sit out” in the back. In-
stead, we have that ever popular in-
verted pleat from the neckline to the
waistline.

Where can you buy this honey of a
dress? Well you just march right
down to the Wardrobe at 190 North
Craig Street and buckle up, as it’s
only 14.95.

boots.

Autumn leaves. Whether you need
shoes for the game, shoes for your
new date dress, or shoes for that dar-
ing new formal—you’ll be sure to
ﬁnd the newest and smartest in styles
at Wise’s, located at 235 Fifth Ave-
