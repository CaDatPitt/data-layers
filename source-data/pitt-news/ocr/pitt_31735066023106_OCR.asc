Unless further review is deemed

, necessary by university adminis-

trators, a decision on a revised
residence hall visitation policy at
Pitt will be made by mid-February,
according to Dr. Conney M.«
Kimbo, vice chancellor of student
affairs. . - ' » A

The administration hopes to

reach a decision on the residence
hall regulations soon so it can be
reported to the university’s Board
of.Trustees at next month’s/'
meeting of the board. In past
meetings the board’ had_ stated
“very strongly that they want ’.a

Shouldta policy be, formulated

and approved by the administration‘
by mid-February, it is uncertain
when the newgpolicy would/go into

effect, said ‘Kimbo.

Kimhot is, currently studying the

C‘ ﬁnal report of the task force he‘

appointed last term to recommend
changes in the present residence
hall regulations. 9 Kimbo will
consider the task force’s ﬁndings
as he drafts his recommendations
for the residence halls. He-will
then submit these recommenda-
tions to Senior Vice Chancellor -Jack
Freeman for his review.

. . _ ' ;_

If Freeman approves K1mbo’s
proposal, ‘other members of the
administration’s senior staff—the
other vice chancellors, senior vice
chancellors and Chancellor Wesley
Posvar—will discuss his recom-
mendations until a ﬁnal decision is
reached,‘ said Kimbo.

 
   

  

 

Kimbo also mentioned the  
possibility" of formulating ‘several -“:5;
alternative recommendations to  
present to Freeman. t . __  ,

Asked to discuss the content of  . , 3
what might be included in his
recommendations, Kimbo said ‘ ‘it
wouldn’t be appropriate.” How-
ever, he commented that t"‘the ‘

State representative Joseph

‘Rhodes’ wife, Linda was on campus

Tuesday night to kick off a
three-week long petition campaing
in Allegheny ounty to elect Rhodes
to the U.S. Senate. V Student
Government Board’s Public and

"Governmental Relations Commit-
_ tee a student lobbying organization

at P_itt, was on hand-to give support
to the campaign.

Rhodes (D-East Liberty) "four-
term member of the state House, isi
running for the Senate seat now
occupied by Republican Richard
Schweiker. Schweiker has an-
nounced that he will be retiring
when his term ends this year.

Linda Rhodes said that the

fields,” said Detre.

Recruited for the project are two
educational psychologists, Dr.
Mary Margaret Kerr and Dr.
Phillip S. Strain, both from George
Peabody College, Nashville, Ten-
n/essee.
primarily with the ways in which
children learn individually.

Also recruited to coordinate the
project is senior medical consul-
tant, Anthony Costello, director of
Child Psychiatric Outpatient Ser-
vices at WPIC and Pittsburgh Child
Guidance Center. The Child
Guidance Center works in close
conjunction with WPIC.

“We are using the petitions as a
spring bo rd into a vigorous and
active cam aign to prove that we
can raise money, organize people

for Joseph, and receive endorse- V

ments.” ,

Rhodes has received many
endorsements statewide, she said,
the latest coming from black ward
chairmen in Philadelphia.

In late November, the Pennsyl-
vania Student Association of
State-Related Universities endors-
ed Rhodes. The student*assoc-
iation represents over 156,000
students at Penn State, Temple,
Lincoln, and Pitt. . ‘J

for his consistent support of
increased appropriations for state-
related juniversities, his work with

They will be concerned’

Costello, with degrees from
University College of London and
ten. years of experience at the
Medical Research Council in
London, explained that the pro-
gram will begin by ‘ﬁnding a
representative sample of pre-
school children to assess certain
elements that push the children
into classic’ learning disability
syndromes. ‘

“A learning disability,” said
Costello, “is an extreme sort of
‘variation. It’s exclusive: there are
no emotional disturbances yet the
child, does not, learn. There are
gaps.”

It is--important to study the

the juvenile justice system, for his
sponsorship of laws for the
decriminilization ot marijuana, and

for his position on several other -

issues.

“The grass roots campaigning is
working well and we have a very
real and very positive campaign,”
Rhodes said. ' 

In the past there had been some
question ‘as to whether Rhodes
could become a viable candidate for
the Senate, she added.

If Rhodes is elected, she said, he
would be the first black Democratic

» Senator in United States history.

The most immediate goal of the
campaign, she noted, is to receive
the endorsement of the State
Democratic Committee, which
meets Feb. 2 to endorse candid-
ates.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Most advertisements seen by the

,American public have sexual

overtones, according to William
Bryan Key, author of “Subliminal
Seducation.” - .
Speaking before a standing room
only crowd in -the Student Union
Ballroom, Key told his audience.
that advertising is a billion-dollar
business in this country alone, with
most Americans seeing an average
of 160 advertisements a day.
‘Advertising, at its most basic
level, is an attempt to ,“create an
unconscious desire to buy‘ a
product,” according to Key. g
“If you remembered the ad, it
wasn’t successful,” ‘the former
advertising executive said. “It, is
the unconscious suggestion that is
going to make you by a product.”
No one ~«isV,sure why these.
techniques work,” said Key.
“Perceptual phenomena are
very hard to deal with because we
really don’t know how the brain

images simultaneously.

works. At this point, we only have
theories,” he added.

Because advertising is such 5 big
business, Key said, agencies know

" how to stimulate people 10 buy’

things.

“We know more about pur-
chasing behavior than anyother
aspect of human behavior," he

said. ‘ “After all, thereeisn’t big
money in studying schizo-
phrenics.” -

The whole theory of subliminal
messages in advertising is that
human behavior and perceptions
are instantaneous, Key said.

“If the marketplacetcan have
access to these unconscious areas
they can make big money, and they

do',’-’ he added.

Most people are familiar with the
“trick” pictures which produce two‘
One has
the faceyof both a young and an old
woman, and "another shows both‘
the proﬁles of two men and a vase.
These are the kinds of perceptions
advertisers deal with, according to

Key.

“You only see one of_ those
‘images initially, but "your uncon-
scious stores the other one whether
you are aware of it or not,” he said,
“And it is these unconscious
memories that advertisers use to
sell everything from hair coloring
to Hustler magazine.

Key showed a slide presentation
containing 17 examples of “trick”
ads.’ ' _

One example was an ad for
Kannon cologne that ran-in many
national magazines.

The ad contains a picture of a
man’s hand holding a bottle of
cologne. According to key, the ad

contains a tale of the human sexual

condition.

In one hand, the man holds‘ a
bottle of cologne; in the other is, a
knife that is trimming the cork top
of the bottle. In reality’, according
to Key, the hand represents a
reproductive organ, and.the knife
symbolizes castration fear. I

rocked Northern California for
more than 20 seconds over
hundreds of miles yesterday,
swaying tall buildings and injuring
several dozen persons.

The quake, recorded at 11 a.m.
PST, measured 5.5 on the Richter
scale according to the Berkeley
Seismographic Station and was
cantered on the Calaveras fault
near Livermore, 50 miles southeast
Most of those
injured were in Livermore, includ-
ing a man who toppled from a
ladder in his apartment.

Buildings shook in San Fran-
cisco; in Monterey, .150 miles to the
south; in Santa Rosa, 50 miles to

the north, and in Sacramento, 90
_ miles to the east. The" quake was

\

felt as far away‘ as Reno, Nev.,
more than 200 miles east of San

The Student Right to Work Bill
(HR 4657). has once again been
introduced in Congress. Original-
ly introduced in l97l, HR 4657
would allow students to decide
whether or not to join or support a

» union when temporarily employed.

Representative Mickey Edwards
(R-OK), one of the sponsors of the
ftsbill, recently said, “Students are

 i   Draft Registration
is ’ Still Unnecessary 5

. , )
President Jimmy Carter’s State of the Union *

address last night was particularly hard-line, as
most Americans expected at a time when so
much is happening in the international arena.
The Soviet Union's incursion into Afghanistan,
coupled with the hostage situation in Iran,
provided a mandate for the president to deliver
his address with such a tone. ‘ .
What the American public was not prepared
for, particularly individuals 18-26 years old,
was Carter’s call for the resumption of draft
registration. Carter’s announcement forces
young people to face the possibility of
conscription in the near future. L
Reinstatement of draft registration is part of

I

. Carter’s new get tough‘ policy, a. political

attempt to show the world (particularly the
Soviets) that the United States can still flex its

E muscles.

mandatory registration since it is merely being
used'as a symbol to show our citizens and allies
America is serious :about: its role in the world
community. It is also a clear signal to the
Soviet Union. , T

The danger here is obvious if taken in context
with Carter’s. ominous warning to the Soviet
leadership. , 1'

“An attempt by an outside force to gain
control of the Persian Gulf region will be
regarded as an assault on the vital interests of
the United States of America,” Carter said.
“Such an- assault will-be repelled by use of any
means necessary, inlcudingmilitary force.”

The sad part of Carter’s call for mandatory

..draft registration is that Congressional
approval of registration, however, will not .

necessarily mean that a peace-time draft
will occur. It does - mean that the U.S.
government is one step closer to forcing young
people into military service.’ .

Carter’s request is a bit premature. Instead
of reinstituting mandatory draft registration,
he should make a strong attempt at bolstering
the all-volunteer force. ' ,

It would be a different story if the United
States seemed precariously close to coming
under attack. Such a situation would warrant

conscription. ' . ‘

But, our borders are not threatened. _ No one
has attacked an American military installation
or massed battleshipsoff our shores.

‘‘ : Carter’s response is based on politics, not
rational, logical thought. We know the events
of the last month have moved us closer, but not
dangerously closer, to a confrontationwith the
Soviets, the results of which could be world
war.

'We also know we cannot let the Soviets,‘ "

randomly attack other nations without ‘some"~.";r

type of response. Our ‘government cannot
stand by while the Kremlin gallops around the
-world preying on greatly overmatched victims.
At the same time, however," the Carter
administration ‘should stick to diplomatic
sanctions and our current military resources to
back up any force needed to counter Soviet
adventurism. A
Pitt’s Student Government Board has
7 offered students, ‘faculty and staff an
opportunity to voice their-opinions on the
proposed mandatory draft registration at its
2 weekly meeting Tuesday, Jan. 29- in the Tower
Aconfegence room at 3:30 p.m. ‘We urge the
university community to use this occasion to
. express. its views concerning mandatory

James R. Pickett (The Pitt News,
January 21) evidently feels that
The Pitt News has sunk to a-new
ethical low because it does not
reject ads for a firm called Tests
Unlimited. In his view such a ﬁrm
subverts the purpose of instructor
feedback and turns the" college
experience into a game.‘ He also
hints that .the service is illegal.

I have no idea whether such a
service is in fact illegal. Mr.
Pickett, in fact, merely states that
«"._7iIe FTC took a term paper firm to
court—a statement which tells us
that the FTC, an_d not the court,
thinks that selling ready-made
term papers is illegal. It also begs
the question of whether tests are in
fact similar to term papers.

Unlike Mr. Pickett, I think that
working problems from past exams
is a good exercise. It can show a
student how well he knows the
material before actually taking an
exam, and can help diagnose
study problems. In fact, I see no
reason why tests should be a
diagnostic instrument limited to
‘instructors.

' that

no wish to have Mr. Pickett or The
Pitt News do it for me.

In response to the letter by

‘James R. Pickett concerning the ad

comment on a few statements
made by this gentleman. He stated
“the test instrument ‘is
designed to give the instructor
feedbackas to how well the student
is performing, with regards to his
understanding of the lectures and
his reading of the text." In the
majority of my classes this
statement would be completely
false. Alot of the time the tests
include questions which were never

On Tuesday, January 22, I had
the great misfortune of being in the
same room as a meeting of the
Pit't’s Student Government Board.
Their meeting was in progress as I

stepped into the Quiet Lounge of I

Schenley Hall. There were nine

people sitting on the committee
and seven more were awaiting their
chance to present their case for

funding. All were in the lower part

of the lounge. In the upper se_ction,’

a dozen students were engaged in
studying, quiet conversation, ‘and
reading. Nobody seemed too
comfortable as the meeting went

tdroning‘ on. I was going to seek

can

‘ sionally.

another place to study, but figured
that if the others could put up with
the meeting. so could I. As I was
sitting down, one of the members
stood and, disturbing all, de-I
manded that the “chatter” inthe
upper part of the lounge be stopped
so that she could‘ hear. It seems

that the noise from the upper part .

of the lounge was bothering only
the meeting and not the rest of us.’
The'student replied, “If you can’t
hear, it’s not my fault.” And that
seemed to be the end of it. But no,
several members of the board came
up to the student-and his friend,
one at a time, in an attempt to evict
the pair- The meeting went on, as
lou_d as before. Before the two
students left, I asked them what
had been said. Among other
things, they had been told that the
Lounge had been “reserved” for
Student Government use, as if to
say that their i“reservation"’
pre-empted student use. My point
is this: As I understand it, the
use of ALL STUDENTS, to relax,
do homework, and snooze occa-
How one, group can
“reserve” it for their own use
seems very unfair to me, no matter
who they are. If other groups can
find a place to meet out of the way
of the rest of the student body, why
can’t the Student Government?

party?

The loss at CSU didn't come as’
such a shock to this observer,- for
several reasons. First_, although
not a nationally’ established bas-
ketball school, Cleveland State is
not the cream puff team schedule
watchers 'think they are. The
Vikings did knock off Rutgers, at
Piscataway last week, and have
been competitive with other presti-
gious schools. ’

Also, there's the matter of where
the, game was played. In past
years, the Vikings played their
(versus Pitt) at
Cleveland’s Public Hall, b_ut a
rental problem forced this year’s‘
game into Cleveland S’tate’s
campus gym, a facilitiy with
approximately 2,500 seats. Such a
move had to beea bit degrading_to
the Panthers. Few major basket-
ball schools would consent to play a

team such as Cleveland State in ‘
but the .
Panthers did. It’s hard to picture» a '

such .a poor facility,

Kentucky or Notre Dame visiting a
place like Cleveland State. ’ \'
In the past, Pitt has made a con-
sistent practice of playing what

competition with 6-feet-11 Mike
Gminski, one of the top centers in
the nation. — ’

But Gminski isn't Pitt’s only
worry. Duke also has a pair of
strong 6-feet-8 forwards in all
America Gene Banks and Kenny

guards in Vince Taylor and Bob

This will be a busy weekend for
Pitt’s two track teams as the men
host the annual Pitt Invitational
while the women travel to East
Lansing, Michigan to compete in
the Michigan State Relays. 4

The Panthers will enter eleven

out of ﬁfteen events and head-

coach Mike Agostinella indicated
he is very optimistic about Pitt’s
chances in several events.

“airy Siriano and Larry Kinney
are on the same plane as the mile
and two-mile relay teams,” Agos-
tinella said. “Our two-mile relay
team of Joel Albers, Terry
Gallagher, Greg Conover, and

Darren Geary has already qualified O

for the nationals.” ,
“We have an excellent shot at
qualifying also with our mile relay
team of Darryl Baynes, Bud
Cooper, Dwayne DeFoor, and Larry
Shippen‘.” Baynes, however, is out
with a leg injury and will b
replaced by Al Coles. ‘ ‘
The two-mile relay team mem-
.bers will enter the open 800- and
Siriano who last
year won the Pitt Invitational mile,
is expected to place high in the two
mile run. ,
Kinney, who made it to the
NCAA nationals last year, should
~ dominate the triple jump. ’,_":nney
made the Junior AAU team last
year and competed against Soviet
Union in-California.
Agostinella added, “We’re real-

ly looking forward to this meet.’

Each year it has gotten better and
better and we're really enthused
about what our team has done up to
this point and what we can do in
our own meet.” Teams entering

 

wk‘.

the meet include those from Mary-
land, East Carolina, Cincinnati,
VMI, and West Virginia.
Meanwhile, the Pantherette
track team ‘will face rugged
competition while in East Lansing.
Thirteen girls wil represent Pitt in

events. Karen Bradley, Sally
Higgins, Maria Sciullo, and Brenda
Chorpenning have high hopes in
the distance medley relay while
Sciullo, Bradley, and Higgins will
team with Gwen Murray for the
two-mile relay. In open events,

Murray and Cissy Wilborn will take
part in the 3000-meter run. .
Head Coach Alfreeda Goff said
she feels the team has a good
chance in the two-mile open
distance relay where Terri McKee
and Margie Lee will enter the

“We will_be trying to qualify for

who are ﬁghting the ﬂu but not
enough to knock‘ them totally out of

going should be at least 90 percent
healthy.”

Like Agostinella, Goff is looking
forward to the meet as are the

- athletes.

“Last week was just a bad week
and the girls know it, and this week
fortunately their spirits and atti-
tudes, were high, their workouts-
very hard, and there will deﬁnitely
be better results this time,” Goff
said.

If the old saying ‘ ‘practice makes
perfect” has any bit of truth to it,
the Pitt men's volleyball team

‘should have no problem whatso-

ever in improving their 9-21 record
of a year ago. And that improve-
ment should be by a very sub-
stantial margin. The men, who
have practiced daily since mid-
August, will soon be able to find
out if all their hard work is success-
ful when they open up the 1980

V volleyball season tomorrow against

rival George Mason University. ,
George Mason should prove to

 

 

be the Panthers’ biggest rival this
season as the two teams will face
each other at least three times this
winter. Tomorrow will mark the
ﬁrst meeting of the year and may
tell the Panthers" just what their
1980 squad is made of. According
to the players, the team is built
around a good deal of optimism and
talent, along with experience and
four returning lettermen.
Returning to the team with a

year of varsity competition under ‘
‘ their belts are captain Jeff Beavers,

Scott Robbins, Ricky Camacho, and
Brian Devine. Beavers, Robbins,
and Camacho are expected to start

tomorrow for the Panthers,-along
with freshman newcomers Dave
Baird, Dan Hardin, and Danny

~O’Donnell, four of the total eight

freshman composing the rest of the
12-member squad. r
Hardin's freshman label may be/
quite deceiving to anyone who is
unaware of the story behind the
man who will be heavily depended
upon as a middle blocker. Hardin
has spent his last four years as a
member of the men's ‘volleyball
team in the Air Force. He should
be able to add a great deal ‘of

maturity and experience to the

Reilly. Reilly was an assistant to
Mike Hebert who is now assisting
Reilly. Hebert’s responsibilities

"were overlapping with those of

being head coach of the nationallly
ranked Pantherette volleyball

unit that should be able to lead the
Panthers to an eastern ranking in
their second year of varsity status.

According to freshman Dave

‘‘It’s optimistic,” said Mitas.
“Once everyone starts playing
together and knowing each other’s
plays we will be avery good team.
We must stick together though.
The fact that we are a young team
is to no ‘disadvantage. It shows
what kind of future we have.”

Thelast strong competition that
the Panthers
September when they participated
in a match with a very experienced,
and prestigious Polish national

team. Pitt fared well in thatfgnatch . '

even though they were defeated
three games to none. ‘The
important part is that they came on
very strong in each game.

“If you compare our match to
that of the one the Polish team had
with Penn State we can see that we
scored more points than PSU,”
said Beavers. “And ‘in the
pre-season Penn State is ranked
number one in the East and ﬁfth
nationally. Needless to say we are
very optimistic about our improve-
ment this season.‘ And that is
based on much more than just the
outcome of the Polish matches. We
came on. strong at the end of last
season, a.nd that’s just how ‘we are
going to open up this year.”

-Directly after the George Mason
match the Panthers will leave to
compete in a ‘very tough Nittany
Lion Invitational at University
Park. The tournament will consist
of, twenty teams that will include
six of Canada's top teams and
many of the highly ranked in the
East. Last year in this same
invitational the Panthers failed to
win a match. This time around Pitt
will change that statistic to a much-

_ more positive one. Practice makes

Luckily for the Pitt :women’s
basketball team, there are two
halves to a basketball game. The
Pantherettes found themselves on
the short end of a 45-34 halftime
score, then roared back for-a 75-64
victory over Cleveland State
Wednesday night. The win raises
Pitt’s record to 15-6.

The Lady Vikings shot a hot 57.5
percent from the ﬂoor the first half,
while they picked the Pantherettes’
zone defense to pieces. On the
other hand, Pitt was. taking the
outside shot and only swishing the
nets 36 percent of the time.

/Then came the second half. Pitt
switched to a man-to man defense
that allowed the Lady Vikings to

With half the season gone, Sherr
asked the girls’ coach if she could
come out for the team. The coach
wanted to know why Sherr waited
so long, and since the sophomore

down. I

Sherr then apporached Androut-

manager and work out with his

Sue's participation on the boys’
team has sparked controversy in
the league; Some consider it the

gymnast to compete for her school.

The question” is not whether Sue
Sherr should compete for Council

Both Gray and Hannah feel that
the year apart won‘t diminish the
