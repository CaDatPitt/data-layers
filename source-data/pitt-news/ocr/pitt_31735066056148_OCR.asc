Students for Life coordinate strategies

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Students For Life metlast night to plan its strategy to get

_ “a seat at the counter” for unborn babies.

“Members of the civil rights movement used this seat as a
sign of their right to be treated as equals,” Project Multitude
co~Director Mary Irwin said.

She went on to tell of a local feminist who explained
the pro-choice movement as “a seat at the counter for
women.”

“But we want people to realize the Woman and her
unborn child should both sit at this counter,” Irwin said.
“You may not hear this too often around "campus or in the
classrooms, but life begins at conception. One must recog-

nize life in the baby as well as the mother.”

Irwin_ and her husband, Bob, were the featured speakers
at the meeting.

They are co-directors of Project Multitude, a local pro—life
effort aimed at peacefully picketing abortion clinics
and educating unwed mothers about the dangers of abor-
tion. A V

V Bob Irwin offered the 40 students in attendance advice
on activism.

“Integrity is the keystone of activism,” Irwin said. “Base

' what you do in truth.”

He said SFL members should concentrate on service and

action but stay away fromrrhetoric.

BLCE cracks
down hard
on underage

intoxication

By Steve Kozarovich
Staff Writer

Underage drinkers who are caught “will
think twice” the next time and maybe
avoid temptation, according to a
spokesperson for the Bureau of Liquor
Control Enforcement. A

If this is true, 115 people are thinking
twice now.

According to Supervisor Robert George
of the BLCE, as many as 102 minors (age
18-20) and 13 juveniles (under 18) were
cited for underage possession or consump-
tion of alcohol in Oakland Saturday night.

Those cited at a South Bouquet Street
party were allowed to take portable alco-
hol tests if they felt it would help their
case, George said. '

“The students did have a choice,” George
said.

Summons will be sent to the offenders
who must appear at a hearing in front of
the magistrate. Those found guilty of their
first offense face a maximum $300 fine and
a 90-day suspension of their drivers
license.

Second and third offense ‘penalties
increase to a mandatory one year and two
year suspensions of licenses, respectively.

The_six individuals who ran the party are
facing a maximum $500 fine and court
costs, but they won’t do any time in jail,
George said.

On advice from their lawyers, the resi-
dents of the apartment responsible for the
party declined to comment.

Underage drinkers were also cited at the
OC parking lot near Pitt Stadium, outside of
the University Beverage Center on Atwood
Street and on the streets of Oakland in the
open.

George said that University Beverage

Home of Pz'tt’s Katz Business School rismgfrom the ground

By Randy Knapick
For The Pitt News

Some early opponents of the
Cathedral of Learning tried to
prevent its construction by argu-
ing the unstable sand deposits
underneath the building would
cause it to sink.

Soil samples andltime have
disproved these early claims,
and the Cathedral rests solidly
on a thick layer of bedrock just
as its builders intended.

On the other side of Forbes
Quadrangle, however, is a
building which is rumored to be
sinking, Mervis Hall, home of
The Joseph M. Katz Graduate
School of Business.

The diamond-shaped patches
of concrete around the columns

in the school’s Graduate Library
of Business appear to have sunk
lower than the rest_ of the ﬂoor.
Plasterboard is buckling. The
ﬂoors slope.

In one corner of the library,
the arching ﬂoor has pushed the
heat exchanger almost six inch-
es higher than its original
position, as if a new mountain
range was forming under the
carpet.

Is the earth slowly swallowing
Mervis Hall?

Rest assured — neither the
building nor its inhabitants are
in danger. ‘

“Mervis Hall is not sinking,”
said Gordon Bugby from his
office underneath Benedum
Hall.

“Though I can understand

why people might think that,”
he said.

Bugby, a civil engineer in the

department of facilities manage-
ment, claims the floor of the
building has actually risen. “It
gives the exact same look as if
the columns were sinking,” he
said.

The fill material under the
floor of the building is known
as “open hearth” slag, a byprod-
uct of steel manufacturing.

This type of slag expands
when exposed to oxygen. In the
case of Mervis Hall, oxygen in
ground moisture causes the slag
to expand, pushing up the
ﬂoors in the process.

Since the building’s columns
are on separate foundations
from the floor, they do not rise

as the ﬂoor rises, giving the illu-
sion that the columns are sink-
ing.

“Facilities management did a
fairly lengthy study to make
sure this was correct,” Bugby
said.

The expansion is most evi-
dent in the building’s library, on
the South Bouquet Street side of
Mervis Hall.

That is where the most fill
was dumped when leveling the
building site.

Bugby noted the bedrock
underneath the building is per-
fectly stable. “The rising ﬂoors
occur only where fill was used,”
he said. ,

“lThe expansion] is a very
slow process, and it didn’t show
itself for about five years,”

Bugby said. “If it would have
found soon after the building
was constructed, it could have
been fixed.”

Bugby said the decision to
use the expanding slag under
the building was “a poor choice
 a construction error.”

Unfortunately, the builder of
Mervis Hall is no longer in busi-
ness.

“They should be liable,”
Bugby said, “but we have no
recourse against somebody
who’s not in business any-
more.”

To repair the problem, the
entire floor of the library would
haveto be removed. A

“The school can’t do without
the library, so it seems more

Bonding, sharing goals of SWE

By Kelly A. Hanna
For Ibe Pitt News

If you are a first-year
engineering student who
just happens to b_e a
woman, there is more
support on the Pitt
campus than you may
think.

The Society of Women if

Engineers (SWE) held its

‘first meeting of the

semester yesterday, and
the main target of attrac-
tion was to introduce
first—year women to the
importance of bonding

as women and sharing

common experiences in
a field that is heavily
male dominated.

The first-year engi-
neering class has 282
men and only 66
women.

“It’s very important to
get enrollment up in
SWE. We want people to

know that we’re out here
so that we can all learn
to beneﬁt from each oth-
ers experiences,” said
SWE president Barb
Cameron.

Sandy Bishop from the
Freshman Engineering
Office spoke about the
importance of getting
engineering students to
succeed their first year at
Pitt.

Bishop has just started
a data base for tutoring
assistance for first-year
students. ,

She has been given
funding to hire four
upperclass students to
help with tutoring. Two
positions have already
been ﬁlled.

Bishop also talked
about a seminar on Nov.
20, for high school stu-
dents interested in engi-
neering.

The day will bring

somewhere between 100
and 150 female students
to the campus and will
focus on the difficulties
of being a woman in
engineering.

General Motors is
helping to fund the
event, and Pitt engineer-
ing students are invited
to volunteer.

Sophomore Amanda
Lidic said that she wants
to get involved because
of résumé purposes as
well as hearing about
other women’s co—oping
stories.

She ‘said that having
such a high ratio of men
in her classes doesn’t
bother her.

The Society of Women
Engineers meets every
first and third Monday
of the month from 12,
to 1 p.m. in Bene-
dum Hall’s Kresge

Pitt Student Union

former bome to

athletes, film stars

By Edward Cabana
For The Pitt News

Before Pitt bought what is now called the
William Pitt Union in 1956, the Schenley Hotel
was “the place to be,” said union manager Chris
Chergi. ’ -

Chergi said it was the “home of the Pittsburgh
Pirates” who at that time played at Forbes Field
(what is now Hillman Library, Forbes
Quadrangle and David Lawrence Hall).

The Pirates weren’t the only ball club to stay
at the Schenley. Looking through some old reg-
isters from the Schenley, one would see names
such as Casey Stengle, Ty Cobb, Rogers
Hornsby and even Babe Ruth. \

Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt,
William Taft and Dwight Eisenhower stayed at
the Schenley during their presidencies, while
from Hollywood came such names as Nelson
Eddy and Henry Fonda.

Singer/actress Lillian Russell lived on the
fourth ﬂoor of the hotel in what is now called

the Lillian Russell Suite.

Thehotel was originally built in 1898. The
main lobby, now a, lounge for students, was

PPC plans
ﬂicks, trips
eXhibitions

By Wendy Parkhouse
For The Pitt News

Trips to Florida, coordinating
speakers such as writer/poet
Maya Angelou and designing art
exhibits are all everyday activi-
ties solely “for the student,”

. according to Pitt Program

Council members.

“This is a student program for
the students,” Assistant Director
of Student Activities Tom
Misuraca said. -

Council members participated
in skits and jokes at the‘ first
meeting of the year last week in
attempts to lure more students
to become involved.

“We want to give you some
insight into what we are about,”
Executive Board Director of
the PPC Mary Grace Scaffiti
said.

The committee said it is plan-
ning some new events for the
fall. Itwill be building a huge
“Hollywood Squares” set on the
William Pitt Union lawn and
inviting Student Government
Board President Jacob Brody
and Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Harmon to be
guests on Pitt—Tac—Toe, a game
show similar to “Jeopardy.”

“I think PPC does a fairly-
good job in offering new and
different activities for the stu-
dents,” junior Amy Novack
said.

The travel committee offers
Spring Break trips, as well as
trips to Pirates’ games, shopping
malls ‘and Cedar Point amuse-
ment park.

The heads of each of the nine
planning committees which
include arts, film, special events,
lecture, leisure learning, publici-
ty, recreation and travel,
described the committees and
asked students to attend the
meetings and give input.

“Some people feel PPC does
not cater to certain students.
And thatis why PPC wants stu-
dents to get involved,” said PPC
member Tony Josato.

The special events committee
organizes all Homecoming
Week events including the Keg
Roll, Pitt Nite Out, the
Fireworks/Laser Show, the

examples of Jesus Christ and
Martin Luther King, Jr., as suc-

cessful activists.

“Do not try to censor the
other side,” he said

“They do not have truth_on
their side, let them say what
they want and be prepared to
respond.”

Irwin/said Pitt students should
take advantage of their limited
time in a campus environment
and make‘ an impact. A success-

perseverance, according to
Irwin.“We must communicate

said. ‘

them.

He said most people don’t
realize the effect of an abortion
on the mother.

According to Irwin,_ Planned
Parenthood does not go far
enough when explaining an
abortion to a prospective moth-
er. ,
“It is heart-wrenching to hear
about the shipwrecked lives of
those who’ve had abortions,”
Irwin said. __ I y _‘ _

“Many experience problems

with drugs, alcohol and difficul-
ty in relationships when
the reality of the abortion sets
in.”
Stephany Pritchett, public
relations director for SFL, said
women who have had abortions
can turn to SFL for support.

“Post-abortion syndrome is
real,” Pritchett said.

“We care for women who are

Beth Schrift, a nursing student
at Pitt, said she was a pro—life
supporter because of her
knowledge of the medical
effects on a woman.

“Women are hurt emotionally
by abortion,”_ Schrift said.

SFL will be taking their mes-
sage to the streets on-Oct. 5,
when it will joinphands with
other local pro—1ifers in the Life
Chain on Forbes and Fifth
avenues.

In past years, participants
have packed the Oakland
streets holding “Abortion Kills
Children” signs. ’

“Education is the best way we
can impact others,” Pritchett
said. _

“We must inform them about
the realities of abortion when-
ever we can.”

added 13 years later.

There are still many remnants
left in the union. The “stairs to
nowhere” located in What is
now the red room, a lounge fac-
ing Bigelow Boulevard, have
two stories about why they
were built.

According to Chergi, the first
story is that “the stairs led to the
main stairwell of the hotel 
which is now the elevator
shaft.” The other is that “the
stairs were__built for Lillian
Russell so that she fwould have a
place to throw her [wedding]
bouquet.”

The ballroom was used as the
main dining room and after din-
ner, “the men would use the
Kurtzman Room as a lounge
and smoking area,” Chergi said.
_ Chergi said the panther in the
lounge “has always been there,”
and it is encased in glass
because “it used to get stolen a
lot .'.‘. by fraternities and other
groups.” It was sculpted in 1897
by Giuseppie Moretti.

Before 1983, the lower ﬂoor,
which is now the Schenley Cafe,
was only a basement and was
rarely used. The basement
along with the first seven ﬂoors
were renovated in 1980. Most of
the main floor was maintained.
All the marble in thelobby is
the original marble.

“Every office had its own

restroom before the renova-

tion,” Chergi said. “Two ﬂoors
were renovated at a time. We
would have to move offices
back and forth [as the renova-
tions proceeded.”

Health care for all

President Clinton’s plan to reform the health—care sys-
tem in America has been released recently, and the
President and Congress are preparing to wage one of
the toughest political battles,Washington has seen in
many years. . J t

Some argue that Clinton’s plan will socialize medicine

in America and the populace will have ,-to settle for a.

less than optimal quality of care.

However, we believe that this-‘initiative on the part of
Bill Clinton is one that shows a real commitment to
ideals. And again, the president knows that the road
ahead will be a very long and tough one, yet still, heis
attempting to realize his vision of an America where all
citizens’ health care needs are met, regardless of social
class.__ _ I _ A _ , '

The plan, which will cover the roughly 37 million
Americans who are currently uninsured by requiring

a everyone to buy ’— with the help -of employers and the ‘

federal government —n a package of benefits covering
hospital and doctor bills, preventative care and pre-
scription drugs, does leave some questions unan-
swered. V

The strategy, although sure to undergo changes dur-
ing its journey through both houses of Congress, in its
current form does not deal with the situation of full—tirne
students at colleges and universities across the nation.
The Clinton plan has not yet answered the question of
whether college students will be considered dependent
on their parents. .

Considering the students who are not currently cov-

ered by their parents’ health insurance, not to mention
the ones whose parents don’t have any coverage, this is
quite a significant constituency that is being left behind,
especially if these reforms are supposed to cover every-
one. . _ ' .
Taking into account provisions" which need to be
rethought, the Clinton plan is one that is fair. Although
young, healthy individuals will almost surely pay more
than they do now, those who are poor, sick and work
in small businesses around the country will gain access
to_ coverage that in the past was only available to those
individuals who worked for large companies.

If we want to bring everyone under the umbrella,
we’re going to have to make some people unhappy.
That’s politics. . ' I l '

We finally have a- president in the White House who’s
willing to put not only his reputation on the line, but his
presidency as well, to bring about meaningful and very
needed changes. There hasn’t been such a person living
on Pennsylvania Avenue for quite some time.

The battle for health care for all is only just beginning.
We won’t feel the affects of these changes for months,
perhaps years. But the battle will be, easier if the presi-
dent and Congress know what the people feel. Read the
plan and voice your opinion because your health is at
stake. _

Media needs to tell facts, not judge

To most undergraduates, Michael Jackson is a
symbol -of pop music and their pre—pubescence.
Whether or not you particularly like him, there is
no doubt that Jackson has become an icon in
popular culture, not only in America, but on the

international scene as well. But now Jackson may.

become a symbol of something else. Recent

events have put Jackson in the midst of allega-

tions of child molestation.

Historically, media figures have always been
heavily scrutinized by the media. Oftentimes, the
relationship between pop stars

‘Many will argue that T/ye Sun is not a high-cal
iber publication. This article serves only to violate
Jackson’s rights as an American, not to shed any
actual light upon the case.

It is the responsibility of the journalist to hold
Jackson’s dilemma under an impartial light until a
jury can decide whether he’s guilty or not.

We must look to the police. When someone is
arrested they are read their Miranda rights —
“You have the right to remain silent. You have
the right to an attorney,” etc. On television and in

the print media, the public

grown up with him. Yes, he’s an
odd character, but the public has
been exposed to him for so long that a tight trust
has been woven between the two. It is this tight-
ly-woven trust that still might rescue Jackson
should he be found guilty. Stars such as Paul
Reubens (Pee Wee Hennan), who did not have
this trust, have been ruined by such scandals.
What is so dangerous about any allegation is
how the public will read the media reaction.
Unfortunately, many Americans will View these
allegations as fact, not being informed that there
is no concrete proof that supports them.
America’s judicial system is based upon the
principle that a citizen is innocent until proven
guilty. Unfortunately, the media can publish sto-
ries which do not attempt to be impartial or
objective. A recent article in The Sun had an

mention of the fact that there is no evidence to

cent. Allegation by definition
means accusation without proof.
At the time of this writing, no solid proof relating
to the child abuse case exists against Jackson.

News of this type has the power to not only
ruin someone, as it did Paul Reubens, but to kill
as well. Vincent Foster, Clinton’s adviser who
killed himself after a particularly ruthless flurry of
attacks by T/ye Washington Post in its editorial
column, is a case in point.

With the addition of a victim’s rights paragraph

in the beginning of stories such as Michael x

Jackson’s, everyone will benefit. The media may
continue to get its stories and the accused may
retain their innocence throughout the process
until they have their day in court.

We live in a country founded upon the princi-
ples of justice. It is the responsibility of the media
to be fair and accurate. Let us make sure
American justice isn’t tainted by the curiosity of a

_ perverted few. -

JFK article loaded with inacurracies

Your Sept. 15 cover story on
the speech by Dr. Cyril Wecht
and his interpretation of the
book Case Closed, by Gerald
Posner, is loaded with inaccura-
cies, both on the part of Cyril
Wecht and the writer of the
story. Since the writer obviously
did not read the book, he could
at least have talked to someone
who did. Maybe then he could
have spelled Oswald’s name
correctly. ‘

‘If Wecht really said that.

Posner alleged that one bullet
struck Kennedy’s skull and then

fell into his front pocket, Wecht

didn’t read the book either.

statement that one must “eat the

Dean Astorino
is Pitt soccer's
high-flying
sparkplug

Byjack Becker
Staff Writer

In basketball they call it the
sixth man — the person who
jumps off the bench and pro-
vides a high-octane scoring
punch. In soccer no such

I label exists, however, for last
season’s Pitt team that player
was Dean Astorino.

Astorino, as the second
leading scorer in ‘92, has a
nose for the goal and is profi-
cient at depositing the ball
wherever his nose may lead.

“The kid scores goals,”
senior midfielder Ted
Noethling said. “He’s good at
it, and he knows it.”

Astorino‘did not start one
single game as a rookie last
year, yet he drilled seven
goals into opponents’ nets
and assisted his teammates
twice for 16 total points, trail-
ing only leader Eric Prex. It is
rare that a sixth man is found
second on the scoring chart in
basketball, but Astorino in ful-
filling that very role is rare.

This season, i the sophomore
from Upper St. Clair is seeing
his role expand from being
the spark off the bench to
being a guy who is expected
to poke one in on a consis-
tent basis.

“We’re hoping he's a guy

that can knock a couple of
goals in for us,” Coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “You need
more than one or two guys
[on the team] to gcore, and he
tends to be a good goal scor-
er.”

Wliat is even more intrigu-
ing about Astorino than his
well—aimed shot is  his well-
aimed shot with the outcome
of the game in the balance.
He buried three game—win-
ning goals last year —— tied for

 

team lead in that category —
the most notable of which
was during a 1-0 Pitt victory
versus a highly-touted
Connecticut team. The victory
prompted Luxbacher to say
that it was among his most

memorable as a coach.

hardly enough to pay the “first”

Pitt rugby
pounds
Shzppensburg

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The Pitt rugby team
opened the fall season
Saturday on a high note
with a 12—,O victory over
the Shippensburg
Raiders.

Senior Ed Davis and
junior Brian Vahosky
both scored tries —
worth five points each —
for the Panthers.

First-year student Sean
Tonkin’ added to the
scoring with a two—point
conversion.

Vahosky’s try was par-
ticularly impressive. It
was an 80-yard run in
which he broke at least
five tackles.

Despite the shutout
victory, Pitt captain Dave
Campion thinks that the
team is capable of play-
ing better.

“I think we’re a little
flat because we had to

half hour bus ride. I
anticipate better play as
the season goes on.
Everything will fall into
place,” Campion said.

“Play was a little slop-
py. We were a little ner-
vous because it was our
first game. I’m just happy
that we won,” senior
John Lewis said.

With one win under
their belts, the Panthers
will be home this week
against Juniata College.

“J uniata is a better team
than Shippensburg,"
Campion said. "The
schedule seems to get
tougher as the season
goes on.

"We’ll be readyf I
expect a strong perfor-
mance."

Campion urges fans to
come out and help sup-
port the team.

“It’s an exciting, physi-
cal game. Anybody who
likes non-stop action will
have a great time at the
game,” Campion said.

The game starts at 1
p.m. at Frick Park in
Squirrel Hill.

Volleyball fitting pieces together despi

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staﬂ Writer

The Wisconsin volleyball
team is one Pitt would beat on
most days.

Saturday afternoon was not
most days, as the Panthers’
worst match of the year coin-
cided with the Badgers’ best.

“We could tell in the team
meeting beforehand that the
[Pitt players] were a little ﬂat,”
Pitt head coach Cindy Braziel
said. “We could not get it
cranking against Wisconsin.”

Braziel said she thought the
loss could be a wake—up call, a
reminder of what the team had

to do to win.

“I don’t think [the team]
expected to drop a match this
weekend,” Braziel said. “To
drop one in sort of an ugly
fashion is a reality check. It
could be a catalyst. I think
we’re going to have a nice win-
ning streak the next few weeks.
I think some people are going
to have their hands full with us
the next few weeks.”

The immediate result was a
decisive win against a North
Carolina team that had been
struggling — the kind of team
that invites letdowns.

There was no second slip,
and Braziel pointed to contin-

ued improvement on defense
as a reason why. After the
opening weekend of the sea-
son, when Pitt lost matches to
Top 20 teams from Penn State
and Nebraska, that was the pri-
mary concern of the coaches.

“Our defense is definitely
coming along,” Braziel said.
“We’re finding now that our
blocking is an area that we
need to focus on. [It is] just
constantly trying to keep‘ all the
plates spinning. We’ve got our
defensive plate spinning. Now
we’ve got to go back and give
our passing and blocking a few
spins and get them all going at
the same time.”

One reason there is now a
premium on defense is the nag-

ging injury to setter Annemarie

Mernagh. She has been both-
ered with shin splints all season
and missed practices last week.

“That’s limiting us quite a
bit,” Braziel said. “It’s starting to
take its toll offensively.”

With limited movement,
Mernagh is not able to do as
much with passes that are off
the mark. This means the first
pass has to be better. One key
to that this past weekend was
sophomore defensive specialist
Laura Horvath.

“She was our defensive cata-
lyst. It’s one thing to get the
ball playable and hang it out-
side or ‘hit it over for a free ball
[easily returned],” Braziel said.
“It is another thing to put the
ball in the setters’ hands in the
front row and run plays and 
get an immediate kill. [Horvath]
did that a lot.

it is up, but she was digging

Division—I [playerJ.”

Other players have not had
as much of an opportunity to
contribute lately. Mernagh’s
health has forced rookie Laurie
Fernandez to split practice time
between outside hitter, where
she was starting early on, and
setter.

“She’s making a tremendous
sacrifice for the team, so that
we can make sure that if Annie
goes down, we can still be suc-
cessful,” Braziel said. “She’s try-
ing to do both things well.
That’s difficult for anyone, let
alone an incoming freshman at
the very beginning of the year

I  living in a new country.

She’s not quite ready to be out
there, but as long as the group
we have out there is successful,
it’s going to be hard to break
in.”

Braziel pointed to ﬁnally set-
tling on a starting six as the

-.main reason for the reduction
in the

playing time of
Fernandez, as well as Melanie
Gustafson. Mernagh and two-
time Big East MVP Ann Marie
Lucanie were locks to start.
Since the season started, mid-
dle hitters Jennie Driscoll and
Sarah Mikla and outside hitters
Sara Mitchell and Carrie
Thornton have established
themselves in the other four
spots.

“When you are in a ‘success-
ful lineup, I don’t think there’s
any coach in the world that
would make a change just to
try to get somebody in,” Braziel
said.

SERVES AND VOLLEYS:
Lucanie was named the Big
East Player of the Week for the
second time in a row after her
performance at this past week-
end’s Hofstra University
Tournament. Lucanie racked up
61 kills and a .400 hitting per-
centage in the three games. She
also moved up into the confer-

: ence leaders in hitting with a

.386 percentage for the season.
She has been near the top in
digs and serving all season.
The Panthers will open their
Big East and home schedules
Friday at 7:30 p.m. night

in the USAir Classic. Pitt will

Astorino

Continued from page 8
aglow. In fact, he doesn’t even
acknowledge his ﬂair for the
“game-winner.”

“It isn’t any different than any
other goal,” Astorino said. “You
could score a goal early in the
first half and go on to win one
to nothing and that’s a game
winner.

“I’d rather score a good goal
versus a good team than a
game-winning goal, against an
average team.” »

So far this year Astorino, like
the rest of the team, has gotten
off to a slow start. He has ta]-
lied one goal and one assist for
three points, all against Buffalo.
Nonetheless, he takes full
advantage of his aggressiveness
and his six—foot frame to out-
muscle defenders to the ball.

“He is an excellent jumper,
so he gets most of the head

I balls,” Noethling said.

A barrier that Astorino will
soon, if not already, be faced
with is that the more he scores
the more attention he will draw
to himself, making him a
“marked” man by defenders.

“As you score more goals, it
becomes tougher to continue
to score,” Luxbacher said.

“I’m looking for more
respect,”»Astorino said. “I want
the other guys [on the team] to
say, ‘We need Dean out here to
help us.’ I think I’m a little
underrated. I still don’t think
[other teams] are giving me
enough credit. '

“The St. John’s players were
after Ted [Noethling] and Prex,
so I actually hope I’m not
[marked] so I can do a little
more. Some teams might put a
watch out, but I don’t think I’ll
change my game.”

Astorino has developed a

‘reputation as a player with a

great shot, but it isn’t necessari-
ly the reputation he would
most like attached to his name.
Luxbacher said that Astorino
has good vision on the field
and is a “surprisingly good
passer for someone who scores

‘ a lot of goals.”

“I get more pleasure or thrill
‘out of making a good pass. I’d
like to be known more as a
passer,” Astorino said. ,

Astorino has the next three
years to pass or shoot the
Panthers straight through
enemy crossbars and, thereby,
nestle himself into the lofty
position of a man sporting a
bull’s-eye on his back.

“I think he has the potential
to be a great player,” Noethling
said. “Somehow it just has to
come out. I think it Will.” U

Penguins
Continued from page 9
In addition to McEachern,
the Penguins also lost left
wing Troy Loney and minor
. league defenseman Paul Laus
in the expansion draft, for-
ward Dave Tippett and minor
league goalie Bruce Racine to

free agency and enforcer Jay
Caufield was released.

To help make up for these’

losses, Pittsburgh signed its
former number-one draft
choice Markus Naslund. The
highly-skilled left wing is
expected to play on the line
with Mario Lemieux.

The Pens have also picked
up a grinder of the Bob Errey
mold in Doug Brown, for-
merly of the New Jersey
Devils. Brown, who signed as

a tryout, is expected to make -

the team.

With McEachern’s loss and
the uncertain future of Kevin
Stevens following extensive
facial surgery after last year’s
playoffs, the Penguins will be

weak on the left side. Leonid
T oropchenko, the 260th over-
all choice in the draft, will
probably make the team
along with Jeff Daniels.

At center, the Pens have
adequate depth with
Lemieux, Ron Francis, Martin
Straka, Mike Stapleton and
Trottier. Don’t expect
Lemieux to go after the sin-
gle-season scoring record,
though, as he is sitting out
training camp to help his
back recover from off—season
surgery.

The right side, as usual, is
in good shape with Rick
Tocchet, Jaromir Jagr, Joe
Mullen and Mike Needham.
Justin Duberman, 23, is a
player to watch. He scored
29 goals in the minors last
year.

On defense, the Penguins
are as deep as you can get.
Larry Murphy, a Norris
Trophy finalist in 1992-93,
leads the way "along with

I Greg Andrusak,

McSorley, Ulf and Kjell
Samuelsson, Peter Taglianetti,
Jim Paek, Paul Stanton, Mike

Ramsey and Grant Jennings.»

While rookies Chris Tamer,
Travis
Thiessen and Steve Bancroft
will be pushing for a roster
spot.

At least one of these play-
ers might be dealt before -the
beginning of the season.

The goaltending tandem is
the same as last year with
Tom Barrasso being backed
up by Ken Wregget.

Waiting in the wings‘of
Barrasso and Wregget if one
of them gets hurt are Rob
Dopson and highly—regarded
prospect Phillipe DeRouville.

PENS NOTES: Penguins’
defenseman Marty McSorley
racked up 24 minutes of
penalty minutes in
Pittsburgh's 5-2 exhibition
victory over the Mighty
Ducks last Saturday night in
Aneheim.

ning touchdown in the
Colorado/Stanford game was a
complete BS call, and if it
wasn’t Bill Walsh on the side-
lines, then Colorado wins by
three?

-Johnny Majors isn’t going to
want to hear this, but
Tennessee’s weekend loss to
Florida was the Vols’ first loss
under head coach Phil Fulmer.

-If the Pirates want to go
after free agents this winter
(cha, right), then I have got
two things for them to look for
— Pitch and Ing.
