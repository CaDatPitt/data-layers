Class in session: CMU studes ant King Day free

Jason Galltnger
For The Pltt News

Students and faculty at Carnegie
Mellon University wanted school can-
celed on Martin Luther King Day, but
despite petitioning the Board of Trustees
classes went on as planned.

According to Vincent Eirene of the
Pittsburgh Dernilitarized Zone, the
University plans to close for half a day
next year. But he is not satisﬁed with that
idea.

“It’s half-baked —- warm, but not
edible,” Eirene said. “It deﬁes logic that
CMU isn’t willing to give this token of
taking the day off.”

The Pittsburgh DMZ, a local activist

group which speaks out against war and
weapons of mass destruction, sponsored
a protest at CMU Monday afternoon.
Not only does-the group criticize CMU
. for not closing for the holiday, it also
objects to military contracts held by the
school. /'

About 50 people, holding pictures of
Dr. King and banners which read
“Surrender to Peace,” gathered outside
Warner Hall for the rally. The group
chanted, “Martin Luther King didn’t die
in vain — today we need to remember
his name.”

Cornell Womack, who has been
active in justice-for-Jonny Gammage
events following his death two years ago,
read a speech of Dr. King’s entitled “A

Time to Break Silence.” Dr. King deliv-
ered this protest against the Vietnam War
on April 4, 1967, one year before his
assassination. ‘ — -

Eirene read to the public a letter
written by Dr. King that called for greater
racial equality. King wrote the letter from
a Birmingham,‘ Ala., jail where he was
held for leading civil rights protests. He
was arrested a total of 408 times.

“Not closing the school for Martin
Luther King Day is sending the wrong
signal to the community,” Eirene said.
“Observing this holiday is necessary for
a people a few generations out of slavery
if they’re going to be able to make a life
and be successful. It’s about pride for the
black community.”

The Pittsburgh DMZ says both the
student government and faculty senate
havepetitioned the Board of Trustees to
close the school for the holiday.
However, according to Eirene, the board
would not raise the issue or “even bring
it to the table.”

Don Hale, a CMU spokesperson,
said no such resolution was ever taken to
the Board of Trustees.

“This decision [to keep the universi-
ty open] was made in concert with the
students,” Hale said. “This past year, the
university president has been working

‘ with the faculty senate and the student

government to decide how .to celebrate
the holiday. Students have an opportuni-

Protesters at the Zapatista rally on Fifth Avenue hold signs and talk to passers-by.

Protesters agitated by ’U.S. 
militarism’ and

Gerald Bergen
For The Pitt News

A funeral letting out of St. Paul's
Cathedral set the somber mood for the
demonstrators across the street at
Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering
Institute.

While Dr. Martin Luther King's
birthday was the major focus around the
nation Monday, a small group in Oakland
rallied to remind the community of more
immediate matters.

The event, which was sponsored by
ZAP (the Zapatista Alliance of
Pittsburgh), concentrated on the recent
deaths of 45 Mayan Indians at the hands
of the Mexican army in December.

Forest Hylton, who attended the
rally, was explicit in his reason for being
there.

"I object to U.S. militarism. I object
to U.S. imperialism," he said. "I don't
think that indigenous peoples should be
killed with weapons supplied by the U.S.
government."

This event, the latest in a series of
low-level encounters between the
Zapatistas (the rebel army) and the
Mexican government, was cited by rally
organizer Ron Douglas as another reason
why'U.S. military aid to Mexico should
be suspended. Also being protested was
NAFTA (the North American Free-Trade
Agreement), the joint US-Canada-
Mexico trade accord which Douglas

alleges "only bencﬁt[s] a few stockhold-

ers on Wall Street."
ZAP, which was formed in August of
last year, chose the SEI A
as its rally site to bring attention to th
SEI's military software contracts. The
site also served as a staging area for pro-
testers to move on to the Jonny
Garnrnage demonstration, held at the
Allegheny Courthouse later in the day.
Although protesters were waving
banners with slogans such as "Mr.
Clinton, get out of Mexico" and "Stop the

through a megaphone, the rally failed to .
turn many heads. One jogger failed to
break his stride as Vincent Eirene, a rally
organizer, thrust a leaﬂet toward him.
Pitt students were present at the rally
and voiced their opinions. Pitt freshman

natives of Chiapas face "being thrown

Pitt senior Josh Wilson called the sit—
uation in Chiapas "disgusting  the [US] -
is just propping up, bailing out  and
supporting the Mexican government."
He also expressed‘ his disgust for
Mexican working. conditions, likening
them to "slaves  like in Southeast Asia .
 where they were binding these people
up and beating [them]." _2

"Chiapas is about an indigenous
movement that is being controlled by ter-
ror," he added. "And that is why I'm
here."

Hale said the university plans to

Eirene said Hale “gets
» The protestors apparently agreed. At
one point, they began chanting, “Don
Hale is a liar.”
CMU English professor Dave
Demerist said the university has a prob-

“Carnegie Mellon is a highly segre-

gated school,” Demerist said. “It’s true

that there are a few African Americans

here, but structurally the school contin- ,

ues to be white dominated. It is a fortress
of white power.”

, “The inner—city African American
community feels alienated from CMU.
They don’t even want to come on cam-
pus,” Demerist said.‘ He called on
the University to improve relations with
African Americans by making the simple
gesture of respect that closing for Martin
Luther King Day would represent.

One protester, Ron Douglas, said he
wasn’t surprised that CMU is unwilling
to close for the holiday. _

“The university is in the business of
making. war materials instead of educa-
tion materials,” Douglas said. “That isn’t
in the spirit of anti—war and civil rights
that Martin Luther King Day is about.”

were indeed a major emphasis of the
protest.

King’s ﬁnal dream, according. to
Eirene, was the eradication of war. He
said CMU, on the other hand, wants
“smart bombs.” A

Eirene mentioned several objection-
able past and present military contracts
held by CMU. Software on F-16 ﬁghter
jets, mapping projects that will “tum the
world into one big digit,” Star Wars tech-
nology developed during the 1980s, and
the robotic helicopter were among them.

' The Robochopper, Eirene said, is
supposed to check distant power lines.
He went on to say that it will probably be
used “for bombing missions and bomb-
damage assessment.”

Eirene retorted Hale’s statements by
saying CMU’s “prep school students”

school’s research and have talked them-
selves into a state of denial.

“Their work isn’t about improving
life,” he said. “It’s about finding new and
exotic ways to end life.” A

Later in the afternoon, students
marched. around the CMU campus
singing gospel songs in another effort to
remember King.

Dressed in a white sweatshirt decorated
with the "Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood"

in front of an audience of almost 50 children,
holding his guitar and smiling from ear to

In a room rich with historical culture, the

st/iummed his guitar for an hour on Sunday
afternoon to a group of smiling, dancing chil-
dren and succeeded once again in bringing
the culture of jazz music into the lives of a

why everybody doesn’t love jazz,” said
Negri.

The show series is called “Jazz for
Jtmiors,” and this particular show was a ben-
eﬁt to raise money for the deteriorating music
hall. The beneﬁt show encouraged the chil-
dren to participate and even come up on the
stage to sing.

The show is one of many shows in
which Negri has worked with children. In
fact, most children grew up with Negri’s
music right in their own living room.

in make-believe land. In the real-world seg-
ment, he plays Joe Negri, the music shop
owner.

“Because of the show, I do a lot of per-
forming for children,” said Negri.

The “Jazz for Juniors” show reﬂects his
work with "Mister Rogers." In addition to
playing and singing spiced-up jazzy rendi-

-tions of popular children’s music, Negri

pipes out tunes from the show, including the
theme. song normally sung by Fred Rogers.
Since he was a child, Negri showed tal-
ent in music. He said he never became a child
star but performed regularly as an actor on
live radio ﬁom ages three to six.
Then, at age 10, he began playing guitar.

“And I’ve been playing since then,” said 
Negri. “It’s been music, music the whole §«

At the age of 16, Negri began playing
professionally with jazz bands such as 
Woody Herman and Shep Fields and toured
the country numerous times playing theatres 
and dances in large cities. 

Negri spent the next few years in the 
Army and once he was ﬁnished, came back 
to Pittsburgh. 0 ;'

“[Buzz and Bill] were a couple of
vaudeville characters, and I was their music,”
said Negri.

In addition to “Jazz for Juniors” and his
work with WQED, Negri had a 22-year
career as musical director on WTAE and has
written several music revues. The River City
Brass Band performed his composition ‘The
Crossing.” He also won a Golden Quill
Award for his work in documentary ﬁlms.

And most notably, he’s been working on
the "Mister Rogers" show since its start in
1968.

His most recent compositional work,
“The Mass of Hope," translates the tradition-
al Catholic mass into a jazz—style event
which has gone over well with audiences,
said Negri.

Negri is currently working with the
"Jazz Nutcracker" that will prerrriere soon at
the Benedurn and is busy trying to get fund-
ing for his own CD while maintaining a fam-
ily life with his wife Joni, and his daughters
and granddaughters.

Negri began working at Pitt 20 years
ago, when the jazz section of the music
department started. Pitt was one of the ﬁrst
schools in the country to incorporate jazz
music into the music curriculum and Negri
was in at the head of the transition as Pitt’s
ﬁrst jazz guitar teacher.

“Back then, guitar was sort of a second-
class citizen,” said Negri. “It was sort of
unheard of in those days. Now it’s a popular
course.”

Not only does he now teach guitar at
Pitt, he’s also an instructor at CIVIU and
Duquesne.

Through the years, Negri has played for
upscale audiences, including President
George Bush, and has played along with big
names such as Johrmy Mathis, Wynton
Marsalis, Yo Yo Ma and Tony Bennett.

He said he was never intimidated by
playing with such famous musicians.

“It’s amazing,” said Negri. “When you
work with people like that, you just sorta
become buddies.”

Some of his own students, though they

feel corrrfortable with Negri, are still irrtimi— .

dated by his talent.

“He’s quite _a player,” said Paul
Fitzsimmons, a student of Negri’s.

Fitzsimmons also commented that
Negri is a supportive instructor. He described
Negri as complimentary, always saying,
“You’re sounding better, you’re sounding
good.” .

“It’s hard to think that blou sound good]
when you’re sitting next to Joe Negri,
though,” said Fitzsimmons.

Another student, Jeff Angel], is
impressed by Negri’s ease and friendliness,
saying he has taken them out to shows and
given them tickets to his shows.

“I became friends with him before I had
a chance to be intimidated by him,” said
Angell.

Looking back on his musical life and all
he has done, Negri likes to remember those
musicians he has played with and the people
he played for.

CMU wron not to
recognize oliday

The suits at CMU decided not to celebrate
Martin Luther King Jr. Day yesterday. Classes
were held, just like any other day.

In effect, they said that the holiday was not
important enough to recognize.

But remembering the man who was probably
our country’s greatest civil rights leader makes a
lot more sense than some of the other events that
qualify as vacation days.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Day commemorates
not just a person, but his achievements in a
struggle that still goes on today.

As one nation, we’re still far from treating
each other as equals. In an increasingly superfi-
cial society that finds its values in Cosmopolitan
and GQ magazines, rarely is anybody judged by
the content of his character.

Because it stands for an idea that is sacred —
equality — it should rank up there with the reli-
gious holidays that few would argue against rec-
ognizing, even if they themselves do not wish to
celebrate them, so that others may.

It’s not important how many people celebrate
— otherwise most of our religious holidays
would disappear, too.

But those who feel strongly enough to actual-
ly do so should have the opportunity.

Many people around the country spent yester-
day carrying the torch for human equality,
protesting and demonstrating their lofty ideals.

Others observed vigils in remembrance of a
man who made it his life’s work to pursue those
ideals, including people from CMU who had to
skip classes or other duties in order to partici-
pate.

People will continue to celebrate Martin
Luther King Jr. Day for a long time, until and
even beyond the day that we all finally recognize
that person sitting next to us as our equal.

Perhaps the white, well-to-do suits at CMU
don’t feel it’s an important enough occasion to
warrant celebration.

But they shouldn’t make that decision for
everybody else.

Gen X-ers should accept responsibility  

Dan Ertman
columnlst

A few short days ago, the
Associated Press revealed two
shocking ﬁndings.

The ﬁrst, and deﬁnitely the
more shocking of the two, was
documents released by the RJ
Reynolds tobacco corporation,
clearly indicating that the company
aimed advertising at teens ages 14-
24. One company ofﬁcial is quoted
as saying, “To ensure increased and
longer-term growth for Camel
Filter, the brand must increase its
share penetration among the 14-24
age group  which represents
tomorrow’s cigarette business.”

The other, which I think prac-
tically falls under the category of
common sense, was a study done
by the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
which found that teens who begin
drinking before the age of 16 are 40
percent more likely to become
alcoholics later in life than those
who do not.

Both of these ﬁndings, of
course, were immediately celebrat-

ed by those members of my gener- -

ation who actually read the paper.
For mine is the no-fault generation,
which seeks to ﬁnd an excuse for
any failing it may have ‘and takes
no responsibility for any of its
actions. And these two ﬁndings are
just two more massive bullets we
can now dodge.

Been smoking two packs a day
since age six? Not my fault. Joe
Camel made me do it. Became an
alcoholic later in life? Not my fault.
I started drinking too young. Why
did you start drinking so ‘young?
Well, I saw my dad have one whole
beer on Superbowl Sunday, and it

The Pitt News

looked like ﬁm, so I had to try it.
Blame my dad. It’s all his fault.

And there is the complex mul-
tiple irony of the no-fault genera-
tion. It’s ironic because this mind-
set may not actually be our fault It
almost certainly is to blame on our
parents, who, in a valiant effort to
not admit that their child-raising
skills may not have been perfect,
began seeking out excuses for us. It
is doubly ironic then that when we
took up the task of ﬁnding an
excuse for everything, our parents’
child-raising skills were one of our
ﬁrst targets.

Johnny didn’t get into Yale?
Oh, it wasn’t HIS fault, blame that
on aﬂirmative action, or racism,
depending on the color of J ohrmy’s
skin.

Hey Johrmy, I hear you didn’t
get into Yale. Yeah, blame it on my
deadbeat parents. They never
encouraged me to do well in
school, and my dad once told me I
could stand to lose a few pounds. I
scarred me for life. -

Personally, I’m rather tired of
it all. I think it’s time we stand up
together and shout, “Yeah, we
screwed up. Bad Some a lot worse
than others. But you know what?
They’re our mistakes, and we
learned from them, and we’re
damn proud we made them.”

It’s time we acknowledge that
free will exists, that television real-
ly doesn’t control our minds, and
that the world isn’t dictated entire-
ly by whether you grew up in a
poor farming town or a rich suburb.
I’m sick of hearing the older gener-
ations talk about how little horse
manure they’d trade for any one of
our worthless hides, and saying to
myself that I’d beat the heck out of
that old guy if he wasn’t so right.

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, 20 January 1998

So, to any new or potential
parents out there: Realize that you
are not perfect. Realize that your
child therefore will also not be per-
fect. In fact, he may be the biggest
dolt this world has ever seen. Also
realize that your child has free will,
and that not all his decisions will be
made by the marketing depart-
ments at Absolut Vodka and RJ
Reynolds. Realize that your child
may decide to make a non-Judas
Priest-inﬂuenced decision to com-
mit suicide. Then decide if you’re
really ready for the heartbreak that
comes with being a parent.

And to the children, teens,
young adults, etc.: Realize that
your parents were not perfect.
Realize that you are therefore not
perfect. Realize that any decision
you make after your 18th birthday
carmot legally be linked to your
parents. Realize that no matter
what. the therapists may‘ say, not
everyone was sexually assaulted as
a chﬂd. Realize that just because
you could distinguish between the
grirming mug of Joe Camel and a
mailbox at age six, you were not
necessarily brainwashed into the
eight—pack-a-day hack you are

today. Realize that there is always .

time to change, and that suicide is
never the answer. Realize that soci-
ety is not to blame.

And if you’re sitting in your
bed crying one night because you
can’t stand the responsibility of it
all, feel free, to blame me for dis-
pelling your illusions.‘ I would look
upon it as an honor to be cursed out
for having done such athing.

If he were alive today, might M.L.K. Jr. oppose affirmative“ action?

Paul Clark
Columnlst

In life, we can “what it” ourselves to
death, but this issue deserves special
consideration. If the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. was alive today, where
exactly would he stand on the issues fac-
ing blacks and all of America today?
How would he feel about issues that did-
n’t exist in the ‘50s and ‘60s, or weren’t
as pressing as the need for respect, dig-
nity and REAL equality for all peoples,
regardless of race. A

The examination of these issues
using King’s own words cannot be criti-
cized as a distortion. King emphasized
numerous times that he always stood
“ﬁrst and foremost” as a man of God,
and this follows that spirit. To say that
King’s overall message thrived under
rigorous scrutiny from all sides, pressed
by horrid conditions much worse than
those we face today, is to make a grand
understatement. His words remain just
as applicable and important to issues
today as 30 years ago.

One controversy: Should the United
States government (federal, state, local
and public schools) stand as an arbiter of
morality in issues such as family values,
abortion, marijuana (and other drug)
legalization, Internet porn and school

prayer? Although 30 years ago King

found his closest allies to be Democrats,
today the situation would be reversed.
Today, the media and Democrats chas-
tise many in the Republican party for
“selling out” to the “Christian right.” If
alive today, King would most likely be a
member of the Christian right by sup-
porting a strong Christian church inﬂu-
ence on, government:

“The church must be reminded that
it is not the master or the servant of the
state, but rather the conscience of the
state. It must be the guide and critic of
the state, and never its tool. If the church
does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it
will become an irrelevant social club
without moral and spiritual authority.”
—— M.L.K., 1963

Truly, religion today is in danger of
becoming exactly what Bill Clinton and

Democrats consider it: irrelevant and
without moral authority.

Another battle: school choice.
Proponents, most of whom are
Republican, simply contend that people
deserve the freedom to choose.

“Man -is man because he is free to
operate within the framework of his des-
tiny. He is free to deliberate, to make
decisions, and to choose between alter-
natives.” —— M.L.K., 1967

The government limits our freedom

by refusing to allow parents to choose to“

send their children to a better school.
This disproportionately hurts low-
income families, those who cannot
afford the only option currently avail-
able, private schools, and looks poor
children in some terrible schools.
Certainly, King would encourage the
implementation of a voucher program to

 

allow parents the freedom to choose
their child’s educational environment.
As far as affirmative action goes:

“We are simply seekingto bring into 

full realization the American dream — a

dream, yet unﬁtlﬁlled. A dream of equal-

ity of opportunity  ” —— M.L.K., 1962
King, as many blacks today do, con-

sidered affirmative action an insult, __.~
which in essence, it is. It states that if if

. your are black or any other minority,

you are incapable of achieving on your
own, and you need help. Dr. King
believed, as I and many others do, that a
black American, or any American, is
fully capable of rising up and attaining
anything.

It may surprise you that King’s mes-
sage rings out in what today defines a
conservative, even Republican tone. In
reality, it is the fundamental changes in
the Democratic Party that have altered
the picture. Today, the Republican Party
stands alone defending__Chn'stian values,
a right to completely equal opportunity
and the freedom of school choice.“
“What if” he were alive? The Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. would stand up
with them. , . '

Paul Clark believes “The judgement of
God is on'America now!” —— M.L.K.,-
1967

King’s work not done, still a fight against neoconservatives.

period of the 20th century in a way that
men, whether they are in
Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi,
Kenya; Accra, Ghana; New York City;
Atlanta, Georgia; Jackson,
Mississippi; or Memphis Tennessee —
the cry is always the same — ‘We want
to be free.  — Martin Luther King, “I
See the Promised Land” sermon deliv-
ered on April 3, I968

Yesterday, this nation honored the
memory of Martin Luther King Jr.,
who was assassinated nearly 30 years
ago, one day after delivering the ser-
mon quoted above. King was in
Memphis to support striking sanitation
workers, the majority of them black, in
their fight for safer working conditions.

For a long time, the memory of
King served as a symbol of triumph, of
America facing up to its failure to treat
all its citizens as equals. White liberals
could point to King’s nonviolence as a
route to the peaceful unification of
black and white America, in contrast to
the militant separatism they saw per-
soniﬁed in Malcolm X. The passage of
time and the persistence of racial
inequity has muted these fond memo-

ries  made’, this viewpoint seem

_ dreamy,‘ unrealistic.

Today, ;:;t1iéifwords of King are as
likely “to emerge from the mouths of
neoconservatives eager to dismantle
affirmative action as to come from nos-
talgic liberals. They hear King’s desire
for a society that judges persons “by
the content of their character,” voiced
on the Washington Mall 35 years ago,
as a stand against programs that seek
fairness by imposing “quotas.” They
see King as seeking equality of oppor-
tunity over equality of outcomes, not
knowing that King understood the del-
icate interplay between the two better
than they do.

We should remember King as he
really was: a complex man, a careful
thinker, but above all a fighter for jus-
tice. Although King did not encourage
black people to take up arms, he was in
no way a moderate.

The “Letter From the Birmingham
Jail” deals with what King calls “the
myth of time,” the idea that somehow
“invisible hands” of progress will
eventually right a wrong. King lived by
Amos’ injunction to “let justice roll
down like waters,” even when it meant
taking an unpopular stand at an “inap-
propriate” time: His early opposition to
the war in Vietnam won him few
friends. -

Remembering King as he really
was means situating him in the full
context of the civil rights movement, a
movement which did not begin with
the Montgomery bus boycott and end
with the Voting Rights Act, but stretch-
es back to the slave revolts of Prosser
and Bacon and lives on today. Often
this “putting in context” involves nam-
ing other great African Americans that
preceded King — a familiarity with
great Americans like Frederick
Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois and A.
Philip Randolph, men with achieve-
ments every bit as substantial as
King’s. j

However, placing King in this sort
of “black pantheon” is missing the
point. The victories of the civil rights

movement were won, not by a handful.

of educated blacks (such elites have
existed since the colonial era) joining
with sympathetic whites, but by the
organization of countless ordinary
black people. Far from being unintelli-
gent clay to be molded by their betters,
these individuals took an active role in
winning their own freedom.

Rosa Parks is often portrayed as an
unsophisticated woman who simply
became tired of abuse; in fact, she

served as secretary of the local“

NAACP chapter prior to her famous
bus ride. A play has recently been writ-

ten about T.O. Jones, who ‘founded the ‘

Memphis sanitation workers union that
struck when two workers were crushed
by a trash compactor; he had only an

‘eighth-grade education. These were the

people who swelled the ranks of civil
rights organizations, took part in boy-
cotts and marches, made King’s words
on nonviolent-_organiz,ation live. ,

is this: Real democracy is possible. The l «

average, ordinary person is capable of
obtaining control over his conditions‘
through principled, uncompromising
organization and action with equals; it

would be a mistake to speak of “jus-T I

tice” and “freedom” as though they
already exist until this process of liber-
ation is over, and anyone who has eyes
to see knows that it’s not anywhere
close. All around you — at the

NBA ecitement

not too exciting

Within one week I witnessed two dif-
ferent kinds of basketball.

One good and one bad. One was fast-
paced, team-oriented and entertaining. The
other was slothful, individualized and dull.

One was college basketball, and the
other was the NBA.

Last Tuesday’s boob—tube menu was
rather sparse. The only glimmer of an inter-
esting television event was the Chicago
Bulls—Seattle Supersonics game.

This game had the chance to be some-
thing special. Heading into the contest, the
Sonics owned the best record in the league,
and newly acquired forward Vin Baker had
Seattle fans already forgetting his predeces-
sor, Shawn Kemp.

On the other side, the Bulls had recent-
ly opened the new year with a stellar two-
week winning streak that perched them atop
the Eastern Conference. Scottie Pippen was
not fully healthy, but was playing regardless.
Michael Jordan was being his magniﬁcent
old self, and Dennis Rodrnan’s gold hair
was speckled with leopard spots.

Everything should have been in place
for one of the best games of the season. The
speedy Gary Payton vs. Jordan in the back-
couit, and Baker vs. Rodman down low.
The Sonics’ outstanding perimeter game vs.
the choking defense of the 1997 champions.

But, instead of the main event I was
hoping for, I was disappointed with not even
a prize ﬁght. The Bulls pulled away in the

' second quarter and never looked over their

shoulders in a rather boring 101-91 victory.
The NBAhas always been an oddity to

me. The SportsCenter highlights make the

game out to be this run-and-gun style that

s only produces swished three-pointers and

picturesque slam dunks. ~
But to watch an entire game is an

0 unequaled agony. Maybe it’s because the

players are so talented that they make the
game seem too facile. Or rriaybe it’s just the
apparent slowness of the NBA game with its
boring half—court defense and adept shoot-
ing that leaves the game uninteresting.

In a typical offensive possession for the
Bulls, Jordan would get the ball and pass it
into a forward posting up on the key. He’d
play with it for a while then pass it out to
Jordan who would either pass it back "into
the forward or try to create a shot for him-
self. Usually the shot clock would be under
ﬁve seconds before Jordan would put up a
jumper or dribble and kick out a pass for a
tl1ree—point attempt. This monotonous rou-
tine was repeated over and over again with

the only variations being a couple more

passes here and there.
Then, in contrast, I watched the Pitt vs.
Rutgers game on Saturday night. Two of the

 

Last-second three-pointer by
Cummings cements comeback,

Ned Schano

Senior Staff Writer

With just 21 seconds left in Saturday’s game,
Pitt’s men’s basketball team trailed the Scarlet
Knights of Rutgers by five points’. Panther forward

Ricardo Greer slashed in the lane for a layup, cutting '

Pitt’s deficit to three. Greer’s crucial steal and basket
on‘ the ensuing inbounds play sliced Rutgers’ lead to
70-69. The Panthers were forced to foul, and Rutgers
guard Earl Johnson-made both of his free throws.
Just eight ticks of the clock remained and Pitt
trailed by three points. With Johnson draped over him,
Pitt’s All-American candidate Vonteego Cummings
dribbled the length of the court before nailing a three-

point field goal that forced an overtime.

“I figured it would go down, I hoped it would go
down and it did go down,” Cummings said;

But the Pitt heroics weren’t over. The scrapping,
back—and—forth play continued into the extra period,
and four minutes into the five minute overtime,
Rutgers held a narrow 85-84 lead. ..

Pirates deal Lady Panthers double-digit defeat

Kevin Lilley

column, page 11

Sports Editor

Nickeia Monis caught fire against H

the Seton Hall Pirates on Saturday.

The Lady Panther center dove for
loose balls, swatted away shots and
ripped down rebounds. Her 15-point,
12-rebound performance was her best
since a similar double-double at Penn
State in December.

Pitt lost to the Nittany Lions last
month by 17 points. And Saturday, the
Pirates put another damper on a good
night ﬁ'om Morris, overcoming an early
10-point deﬁcit to beat the Lady
Panthers, 72-62.

“Nickeia has really developed,” Pitt
Head Coach Kirk Bruce said. “There’s
no reason that she can’t average a dou-
ble-double.” ’ ' ’

Saturday’s double-double was
Morris’ third of the season. All three
have come in losing causes.

The 6—foot-7 center’s first bucket
came in Pitt’s garne-opening run — a
ﬁve-minute offensive burst capped by

Michelle Katkowski’s three—pointer that '

put the Panthers up 12-2. It was the first
of many Pitt double-digit leads of the
night, all of which came in the first half.

Morris gave the team its last such
lead, taking a Kortrii Webb pass above
her head (a problem for the Lady Pirates
all night; no Seton Hall starters were
above 6-foot-2) and easily sinking _a
jumper.

Pitt was up 27-17 after that shot,
and a give—and-go between Gina
Montesano and Monique Toney that
ended with a Montesano layup made the
score 29-17.

Seton Hall Coach Phyllis Mangina
called timeout and huddled her team
around her for a speech. Whatever was
said, it worked: The Pirates dominated
the last six minutes of the half, going on
a 13-2 run and cutting Pitt’s lead to one

point at the halftime buzzer.
“We didn’t- take the shots that we

should have taken,” said Bruce, when ,

asked what caused the sudden Seton
Hall surge, “and the defense got a little
lax. That’s bad  going into the half.
You want momentum going into the
half.”

What Bruce didn’t want going into
the half was a 31-30 game, especially
after leading by 10 or more points for
much of the early going.

A‘double-digitjlead long gone, Pitt
would soon lose the lead entirely. "Forty
seconds into the second half, Seton Hall
guard Sandy Mitchell scored on a break-
away layup to give the Pirates a 32-31
lead.

Pitt would ﬁght back to tie the game

a number of times in the next few min-
utes, and with Seton Hall up by one,
Morris took a pass from Katkowski and
drained another jumper to give Pitt the

Call it a family affair of sorts.

Ricardo Greer versus Jeff Greer.

Start with the similarities. Both
are freshmen. Both are guards. Both
start for Big East teams. Both stand
about 6-foot-5. Both have been
named Big East Rookie of the Week
on separate occasions.

But the similarities stop right
there. Jeff, the younger Greer, is the
complete antithesis of his Panther
counterpart, with his lanky frame
and soft shot. Ricardo brings his
athleticism and ability to drive to
the lane. Ricardo Greer came to
Pittsburgh touted as one of last sea-
son’s top 50 basketball recruits. Jeff
Greer, despite being named an hon-

as Manhattan and Iona but decided

irst place in the Big EastBatt|e of the Greers

New Brunswick.

But even Ricardo considers his
younger brother as one ofthe best
athletes he’s ever played against.

Would all these factors amount
to a confrontation? Was it a friendly
battle or a raging rivalry?

No, more like a family reunion.

With friends and family in the
stands, the brothers Greer staged
only the second brother combination
to ever face each other in Big East
play.

It’s such a family affair that the
entire Greer clan made the haul
from the Washington Heights dis-
trict of New York City, took up an
entire section of the stands and
cheered their favorite sons on, wav-
ing a Dominican Republic ﬂag and a
banner that read “Washington
Heights’ Finest.”

And it’s such a family affair that
even E.J. Borghetti, the assistant
director of media relations, wasn’t
able to chase down the Greers after
the game. A member of his staff,
however, saw both of the Greers

schmoozing with

outside of the
locker room.

The Greer fam-
ily cheerleaders
put on a show,
almost as good as
their favorite sons,
waving ﬂags and
banners, chanting
names, sometimes
alternating their
cheers between the
two brothers. It
was enough to
make the fans wish
there were more
spectators like the
Greers.

There was no
aversion toward
either player or
either team. When
the Greer clan
looked as if it was
becoming partial
to Ricardo, the emotions suddenly
turned in favor of the younger
brother. The Greers shouted. They
whooped and hollered for their sons,
regardless of who was shooting,
scoring, blocking or rebounding.

When Jeff hit a three-pointer to
tie the game at 22 late in the first
half, the clan went nuts. b

When Ricardo delivered a jump

shot that broke the tie, the
Washington Heights crowd cheered
him on. -
Later on in the game when
Ricardo made a jump shot to give
Pitt a ﬂeeting 76-75 lead with less
than four‘ minutes. remaining, the
clan went crazy.

When Jeff made a layup that
gave the Scarlet Knights the lead,
the Greer cheering contingent
voiced its approval.

But in the end,

Ricardo

   

 over his brother, Jeff (#25).

when the" final '

stats read that Ricardo scored 22
points en route to a Panther victory,
his head coach summed up the Greer
experience perfectly. .

“Ricky stepped up in this game,
an emotional game for him,” said
Panther Head Coach Ralph Willard.
“You have to understand that this is
his little brother who he loves very
much, and you saw it, half of
Washington’ Heights was up here
tonight. It was an emotional time for
him and he came
points.” '

But even in the overtime thriller, .

would the game come down to a
Greer versus Greer challenge? '
Nope. Isaac Hawkins tipped in
the winner with 13 seconds left. Jeff
Greer’s nine points went for naught.
But the Greers did enough to

1ower—seeded teams in the Big East were
squaring off in -an early league battle.
Obviously this wasn’t a typical college con-
test, with a game—tying three—pointer by
Vonteego Cummings in the ﬁnal seconds
and an overtime win by the Panthers.

But despite the dramatic outcome of the
game, it still showed why watching college
basketball is 10 times better than the NBA.

Because the talent level is lower in col-
lege, this permits more spectacular and
exciting plays. More missed shots lead to
more fast breaks, more turnovers lead to
more breakaway dunks, and lesser ball—han-
dling skills lead to-more pressure defense.

FROM PAGE 9

There are more blocked shots and more

three—pointers 

There is also a greater chance for a team
to make up a deﬁcitjin the college game (i.e.
Pitt’s win over Rutgers) because of poor
free-throw shooting and the closer three-
point line. 1. '

And the colleg_e.;players aren’t worried. 4

about their stats because’ they don’t get paid.
They just want to win. And that’s why col-
lege basketball’s 64-team championship
tournament is the best two weeks of sport

/America has to offer. The ﬁnality of single

elimination and the frequent upset deliver
unmatched drama to the viewer that the
NBA will never be able to produce.

39-38 lead. The basket gave her 10
points on the night, cementing the dou-
ble—double.

Morris hit the 10-point mark at
14:17 in the second; Bruce would have
liked to have seen it sooner.

“I just wish we could have got the
ball into her earlier,” said the coach, who
was disappointed at the lack of front-
court production early in the contest.

Most of the production problems,
according to the Bruce, came as a result

half.

The Panthers would ﬁnish with 29
team fouls. All of Pitt’s starters finished
with four fouls except for Montesano,
whose ﬁfth foul came in the game’s final
minute. She would leave with 10 points
on the night. ‘ ,

Seton Hall had 19 personal fouls,
resulting in just 19 foul shots all game

for Pitt. Pirate leading scorer Danielle -

Golay did foul out, but her teammates
were able to pick up the slack.

“She picks up ﬁve fouls and we still
can’t win the game,” Bruce said of
Golay’s foul trouble. “We knew that we
let a sub [Pirate Danielle Davis] come
off the bench and have a career high.
You can’t win a game when you do

that.”

Seton Hall padded its lead for much
of the second half, ﬁnally going on a 7-
0 run near the six-minute mark to make
the score 60-50. Davis’ three-point play
was the highlight of the run, opening the
lead to nine points, giving Davis 15
points on the night, and putting Seton
Hall in the double bonus.

Thanks to the double bonus, Seton
Hall kept its lead despite making only
one shot from the ﬁeld the rest of the
game. Late Panther fouls added to the
Pirates’ 44 total free-throw attempts.

Pitt will attempt to snap its three-
game losing streak when it begins a
threeigame road trip Wednesday at
Boston College. The Lady Panthers
return home on Saturday, Jan. 31 for a
2:00 p.m. contest versus West Virginia.

Pitt has thrown a curveball for stu-
dents in its spring sports lineup. Actually,
it’s more of a 90-mile—an hour underhandg
pitch.

This semester the Pitt Athletics
Department is unveiling a whole new ball-
game: a varsity women’s softball team.

The team, headed by Coach Michelle

      
   

“There was no way we could have
been ready to play by this spring,”
Sprague said. “In the beginning that was
frustrating. In the end, it was a blessing.”

Sprague said that the team, under
Phalen’s coaching, will be better prepared
to handle a full schedule after this modi-
ﬁed season. This is because -of the experi-
ence the team will get on the ﬁeld and

from Phalen, who played varsity softball

at the University of Missouri for four
years. She also. said that Phalen + who
was selected after a national search — has
the background to effectively coach soft-
ball in a Pittsburgh-area climate and get
her team used tocolder-climate playing.

“She has the background as a player
and a coach to start up a team, and that’s
no easy undertaking,” Sprague said.

After playing at Missouri, Phalen
went on .to become an assistant coach
there for another three years, and, most
recently, was an assistant coach for anoth-
er two years at the University of South
Carolina. With two college softball World
Series and four appearances out of a pos-
sible ﬁve during her coaching career at the
“Top 32” "softball regionals, Phalen said
she is ready to take Pitt’s program to sim-
ilar heights. ' A

“I’ve been with some really success-
ful programs,” Phalen said. “With what I
know and with my work ethic and with
the players we have at Pittsburgh, we’ll be
in the same league.”

Phalen said she has been focusing on
“the basics” with the relatively young
team — which is comprised of ’ ﬁve
juniors, ﬁve sophomores and nine fresh-
men. But the work has already begun to
pay off in Phalen’s opinion. Practices,
which have begtm at 6:15 a.m. in the Cost
Sports Center, have really “brought the

girls together as a team,” Phalen said.
“I’d just like to get it done right  not
just get it done,” Phalen said. “They take a
lot of pride in what they’re doing.”
Phalen said she has seen “incredible”
improvement since the end of tryouts last
semester. “We’re looking to see what we
can get out of the girls,” she said. Playing
.on a grass surface, however, will be much
different than the turf of the Cost Center
and Phalen expects a little trouble to arise
from this. ' ,
h le different mentality,” she

  

. . - . - e. «p« pient
on the‘ team — is ﬁom Florida. Both
Phalen and Sprague said there was no
heavy recruiting drive when they formed
this year’s team. ,

' Already looking ahead to next year,
Phalen said she is currently. recruiting
young women and trying to get them to be
a part of Pitt’s team. She conﬁrmed that

‘two women have signed ‘ on for next

spring and, as of last week, Phalen said
another had given "a verbal conﬁrmation
that she will play. One thing that she said
she is looking for when recruiting is ﬁnd.-
ing women who will be happy as a part of
Pitt’s new team. I

“I want to fortify the team we have
this year" with better players and get.the
girls into a program they’ll be happy in,”
she said. “I don’t want anyoneto come
here and be unhappy.” Although Phalen is
carrying out a highly selective recruiting
program, she said the outcome so far is
“really success .” ' .

Although the team is tentatively
scheduled to play a home-opening dou-
bleheader against St. Francis College on
March 25, it still does not have a ﬁeld.
According to Sprague, negotiations are
under way for the University to purchase
a nearby ﬁeld, but she declined to reveal

any speciﬁcs because this might hurt the *1

bargaining process. .

Pitt’s ﬁrst -action will play in the
Robert Morris Tournament — which will
be their ﬁrst_ action — on March 21 and
22. The team has also scheduled ﬁve dou-

bleheaders — two against _Youngstown

State, Robert Monis and Kent State.

In the meantime, Phalen said the team
is ready and that this year will be the pace-
setting year: A

“SMART” FALL

Choosing a place to live is difficult but very important and deserves the investment of your time. We suggest

you compare numerous apartments, check out the reputations of the landlords, and talk to the existing tenants

when the landlord is not there. To start you off on the “right” track, call our number (24 hours) and leave your
name and address (and your parents?) so that we may mail you detailed information for your consideration.
