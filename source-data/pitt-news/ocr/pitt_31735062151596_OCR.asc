No Tap Dancers
At Rifles Dance,
Explains Kaiiys

Wishing to correct a mistaken im-
pression which may have been aroused
in some readers’ minds by the tap
dance story in the previous issue of
The News, A1 Kairys, BA39, in his
official capacity as chairman of the
Pitt Riﬂles dance, made the follow-
ing statement:

“There will be no specialty tap
dancing at this affair. Of course,
some people tap when they dance and
some dance when they tap. But the
tapping will serve to induct the offi-
cers of Pitt Riﬂes.”

With the tapping explained, the
chairman also announced that the or-
chestra would be that of Bob Dun-
can, who has played at many campus
affairs, including the recent Engi-
neers’ Ball.

As is the custom, formal military
dress will be required. Admission is
restricted to active members of Pitt
Riﬂes, candidates, men in the upper-
class corps, and alumni members.

The price for all this, it might be
mentioned, is the unique sum of
$1.75, which entitles two to admis-
sion to the Twentieth Century Club
on Friday evening.

Returns Again

DR. ROBERT C. CLOTHIER
RUTGERS University president,

who is scheduled to make the

Clothier, Rutgers President,
To Speak At Founders
Banquet Of ODK

 

An address by Dr. Robert C. Cloth-
ier, president of Rutgers University,
and initiation cerem-onies for 14 tap-
pees will be the highlights of the an-
nual Founder’s Day celebration of
Omicron Delta Kappa, national hon-
orary men's activities fraternity,
this evening at the Hotel Schenley.

Dr. Clothier will speak at the ban-
quet, scheduled to begin at 8 o’clock.
Prior to the formal dinner, initiation
services for the new honorary and
undergraduate tappees will be held at
6:15 o’clock.

The main speaker for the evening
is prominent in both educational and
business circles. Graduating fr-om
Princeton University in 1908, he
holds honorary degrees of doctor of
letters from that school, Tusculum
College, Dickinson College, New York
University, and the University.

In 1923, he was appointed head-
master of the Haverford School, and
continued in that position until he
came to the University in 1929 as
Dean of Men, serving in that capa-
city until 1932. In that year he be-
came president of Rutgers Univer-
sity, his present office.

In his business capacities, he has

Lobby Will

Be Closed

After Holiday Recess

 

Cathedral Elevators To Be

Boarded On Ground Floor

To Facilitate Construction In Commons Room;
Work On Walls, Ceiling Will Be Started

So that the construction of the
limestone walls and ceilings can be-
gin there, the ﬁrst-ﬂoor elevator lob-
by of the Cathedral will be closed
after the Christmas holidays. Stu-

dents will board elevators on the
ground ﬂoor, the planning depart-
ment announced this week.

The elevator lobby on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor will be ﬁnished in the same style
as the Commons Room, to which it
will form a main entrance. It is ex-
pected that this lobby will not be
opened for use until next spring at
the time when the Commons Room
will have been completed.

Meanwhile the limestone walls in
the Commons Room have been built
up to a sufficient height so that the
stone setters are now ready to set
in place the Tas de Charge or
“springer” stones on the top of the
walls to support the arched ceiling.

“One feature of the Commons

Room ceiling is that every piece of
stone going into it is curved,” A. A.
Klimcheck, University architect, em-
phasized.

The keystones, or supporting stones
in the center of the arched ceiling,
are to be carved with English Gothic
characters.

On the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral the corridors are rapidly being
ﬁnished so that they can be ready for
use after Christmas. The walls are
built of architectural glazed tile,
while the ﬂoors are laid with natural
cleft slate.

The entrance from the Forbes
street terrace was opened this week
for general use and can now be sub-
stituted for the Belleﬁeld avenue
entrance, which has been closed, ac-
cording to Mr. Klimcheck. After
Christmas holidays, two entrances
will be open on the Bigelow Boule-
vard side instead of the one which
is being used at present.

BRIDGER SIGHS!

Team Needs New Material
After Faculty Victory

 

 

“I guess we need a reorganiza-
tion,” sighs Leonard Seder, C37 .
“After that match Wednesday night
’we’ll have to issue a call to all stu-
dents with experience to come to our
meetings and help us out. We'll even
change the day of meeting if we
have to.”

The group to which he was refer-
ring was the University Bridge Club,
of which he is president, and the
match, in Room 817, Cathedral, Wed-
nesday evening, was the one in which
his group was handed a decisive set-
back by faculty experts, led in the
North-South positions by Dr. Jules A.
Labarthe, senior fellow of the Mellon
Institute, and Dr. G. E. Stegeman,
professor of chemistry, and in the
East-West by Dr. James E. Taylor,
professor of mathematics, and J.
Howard Dice, University librarian.

Drs. Stegeman and Labarthe, with
a score of 124, were one-half point
ahead of the faculty team of William
J. Martin, assistant professor of his-
tory, and Roger V. Shumate, instruc-
tor in political science. The leading
student team was that of Clarence
Schulz, BA39, and Charles Anderson.
BA37.

arrangements of the songs.

Students who intend to write or
have already written music for the
1937 show must turn it in at the dean
of men's office, Room 801, Cathedral,
by January 11.

“The only reason music was not
distributed in former years,” declared
Baskin, “was that it has always been
turned in too late for publication.”
He urged that student songwriters
act immediately.

months.

Elected officers included chairman,
council representative and secretary.
The chairmen and council members
automatically become members of
Freshman Council, governing body of

ﬁrst meeting of the year, under the
direction of Mary Jane Beacliler, C38.
The Council also includes the upper-
class unit advisers.

Unit Officers To Meet

At this meetingthe members be-
came acquainted with each other.
Each council member stood up and
introduced herself to the group as-
sembled. Miss Beachler explained
the reason for and purpose of the
council.

Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean
of women, welcomed the members
and expressed a sincere desire to see
the council succeed in its undertak-
ings during the coming year.

All officers of freshman units will
meet Monday from 4:30 until 6
o’clock to receive training which will
enable them to work efficiently in
leading their units, and presenting in-
telligent, interesting programs.

Leaders Issue

Sing Challenge

Groups Offer Original Skits
With Costumes, Music
For Annual Match

 

It has happened before! Remem-
ber? As is traditional, once a year,
women class presidents issue a chal-
lenge to the other presidents to meet
for an interclass sing. This year’s
competitive sing will take place Fri-
day at Heinz House during the ﬁfth
hour.

Class spirit at the sing might be
compared with the spirit at a Pitt-
Duquesne basketball game. Each class
presents an original skit set to music,
which in their own opinion, is sure
to win the prize.

Appropriate costumes as well as
clever verses and “catchy” tunes are
used by the classes in the effort to
win the award. The class, which in
the opinion of the judges presents the
best skit, receives a cup which it may
keep if it wins three successive sings.
No class has ever done so to date.

Lucy Conn, C38, is chairman of the
Traditions committee, which super-
vises the sing. Each class chooses
a special Interclass Sing committee.

Jane Springer is the chairman for
the seniors; Ann Thompson, for the
juniors; and Eleanor Haught and Bet-
ty Jane Martin are co-chairmen for
the sophomores. Marjorie Kuhbach,
representing the publications unit, is
chairman for the freshman sing.

‘Spring Class’ Opens Series
Of New Pictures With
Film Taken Here

 

By William Murray

“Spring Class,” motion picture fea-
turing students, former students and
graduates of the University, will be
shown at the ﬁrst program in the
new series of ﬁlms sponsored by the
department of Fine Arts, January 14
in Frick Training School.

Dr. Benjamin Williams, professor
of political science, is the teacher of
the class. Although Dr. Williams
confessed that he had not acted since
the time he was in a high school class
play, Philip Elliott, assistant profes-
sor of ﬁne arts and director of the
movie, was enthusiastic about his
performance in “Spring Class.”

Charles Foreman, graduate assist-
ant in the department of English,
has the male lead opposite Jean Law-
son, who will be graduated from the
Colleeg in June. Also in a promi-
nent part is Sarabel Browarski of
the Drama School of Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology.

Photographer Carries Mood

Mr. Elliott producted, directedand
photographed the entire ﬁlm on the
campus last year, using exteriors of
University buildings, as well as in-
teriors of classrooms and halls, as
background. The coming of spring
and its effect on the teacher and stu-
dents of the class are viewed impres-
sionistically.

Angle photography and ﬂash shots
are employed extensively to carry the
mood and feeling of the idea, an
idyllic spirit being combined with
surrealist elements of symbolism to
form a complete pattern.

University students and graduates
in the cast are Ruth Richards, C36;
Sarah Harris, C36 ; James Sandor,
C38; Mary Snyder, C37; Frank Gib-
son, C38 ; John Jeffries, BA37; Wil-
liam R. Murray, C39; William Har-
vey, C36; Dorothy Grote, C36, and
Ruth Richards an-d Katharine Par-
rish, former students.

“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” cel-
ebrated German ﬁlm directed by Rob-
ert Wiene, will also be shown at the
ﬁrst program. Werner Kraus, noted
German actor, plays the role of Dr.
Caligari, an aged inmate of an insti-
tution for the insane, who tells of

Dr. J. M. Artman
Will Talk Today

At Inquiry Forum

 

 

Dr. Joseph M. Artman, Chicago ed-
ucator and editor, will discuss “Stu-
dents and Politics” at Inquiry Forum,
today at 12:30 o’clock in Room 107,
Alumni Hall.

The speaker, who is editor of
“Character” magazine, has been as-
sociated with several political reform
movements in Chicago. In recent
years he has served as secretary on
the Committee for City Manager and
secretary of the City Club.

He is also actively interested in
character education, having taught
the subject in several colleges and
universities. Dr. Artman conducted
courses in education at Northwestern
University, University of Chicago,
and at the University. He has lec-
tured at Emory University and Bos-
ton University.

At present Dr. Artman is secretary
of the Character Education Commit-
tee of the National Congress of
Parents and Teachers. He will come
to Inquiry after a week-end of ad-
dresses and seminars at the Intercol-
legiate Institute of Public Affairs.

jstudenvt Dances

' T WAS the freshmen who ﬁnally rewarded
I the «campus night prowlers with a. generous
sample ofbetter d-ance music Friday night. Tom
Gentry, featuring his personality-singing_wife,
Patricia Norman, has a ﬁne band, and if the
dancers'h'av'e anything‘ tosay about it, can return
most anytime for a repeat appearance.

Successful as was this social event in com-
parison to -the usual University dance, the_ques-
tionrhasbeen raised, just how important is the
role played;-by the orchestra for student dances?
Students don’t know. They’ve never had a “top”
ban'd ‘ for contrast.

Seldom does a dance attract more than 350
couples. This is immediately recognized as a
very small portion of the student total. Since
most of that number- represent a class of students
whichattends -virtually all dances, what then
aboutthe occasional few- and the huge number of
people who seem indifferent to the whole system?

It is doubtful if their indifference can be traced
to lack of development along those lines, for
most every student dances at least two or three
times each semester. If they go outside of the.
University for recreation of this sort, then there
is something wrong with the student dance sys-
tem.

If students desire ﬁrst-rate “national” bands
then they should be secured. If undergraduates
decline to attend University functions because
there is no table service provided, the dance is,
once more, not adequate in its strictest sense.
Local bandsvwith at low-priced ticket charge has
proven to be only a fair solution of the problem.
Thereare other things which must make Univer-
sity dances unattractive to a large number.

Possible Differences

PERHAPS the situation at other schools dif-
fers in regard to the percentage of resident
students, proximity to large city facilities, or or-
ganization of the undergraduate students. How-
ever, there are schools, for instance Ohio State,
situated in a moderately large city, attracting
more out-of-town. students than this University,
yet theyhave established a system wherein there
is’ actual competition in the buying of tickets. If
blocks of tickets are not purchased in advance,

‘be a ﬁne idea.
series of 'Panhe~llevnic dinners, with all senior Zetas in-

the pledges will stage an affair.

the Ohio State dance-goer just can’t purchase ad-
mission to a dance.

But where could the dance be held? That, per-
haps, is the key to the situation. There is no
place in Pittsburgh that could accommodate a
crowd larger than 400-500 couples. However,
there have been no dances where people have ac-
tually been turned away from the door, and few
times when the hall was not large enough for
the most successful events.

If the dance couldbe held in a place that is a
deﬁnite part of the University, as is the situa-
tion at many large schools and most of the small-
er ones, then the hall would necessarily be ade-
quate to handle the largest possible numbers and
the heavy rental fees would be side-stepped.
Some time, soon, perhaps that will be realized.
Possibly the Commons Room in the Cathedral
may be used for that purpose. When that time
comes. it is hoped that many of the present prob-
lems will be solved. Until that time comes, how-
ever, there should be investigations to determine
what can be done immediately to improve con-
ditions.

Chancellor Bowman Declares University
Established On Partnership System
With State Commonwealth

(Ed. N'o‘te~: This is the third in a series of articles
concerning the history of the University. Next
semester the iresquicentennial anniversary will be of-
 observed ‘by a ‘ﬁtting celebration, plans for
which are already under way.)

In 17-87 the Pennsylvania legislature granted a
charter to the Pittsburgh Academy, establishing a state
educational system with the provision that Pennsylvania
universities are not to be controlled and owned by the
state, but are to be encouraged and promoted as part-
ners-hips.

So declared Chancellor John G. Bowman in his bien-
niail report to the University’s Board of Trustees, Sat-
ur ay.
With the celebration of the so uicentennial :anni-
versary to be held next year, Dr. owman brieﬂy re-
viewed the history of education in the state. He ‘pointed

out that the original charter was based ‘upon Benjamin .-

Franklin’s theory of education, that “higher education

was to be a symbol of loyalty to the Commonwealth.

and that it ought to be a primary object with the
government.

In 1819 the state legislature changed the name of the
Academy to Western University of Pennsylvania, show-
ing that the institution was a state university for the
“—-country west of the Allegheny mountains,” Dr. Bow-
man pointed out. W‘itli”o'ut change of charter, the in-
stitution became the ‘University of Pittsburgh in 1908.

Brieﬂy reviewing ‘the history of the University, Dr.
Bowman declared that 150 years ago Pittsburgh was ‘a
village of 500 people, :£a.'cirng wilderness and poverty,

in need of better roads, ﬁnances, and more adequate-

tools, struggling forifood and shelter and life itself.

“'l‘»hese pioneers who composed the village were forced

to think," the Chancellor asserted.

Spiritual thought and action, ' characteristic of the
early ‘settlers, brought with it the desire for higher
education. Western Pennsylvania needed ‘an -academy
or college or seminary, the .report «continues. Finally
a petition was presented to the legislature in Philadel-
phia, and the charter was granted on February :28,
1787, just 150 years ago this coming February.

In other sections of the review, Dr. Bowman in-
cludes reports of the 17 schools an-d divisions of the
University, obituaries of ‘faculty members and alumni,

trustee and faculty appointments, faculty promotions,‘

registration ‘ﬁgures, -and a fﬁnancial statement covering

‘the 1934-1936 biennium.

Registration during 1934-1935 was 10,1412, the re-
port shows; -and in -1935-1936, was 10,522.

93.7 per cent of the students coming from Allegheny
and 25 other Western Pennsylvania counties.

The series, loaned by the Museum
of Modern Art, is divided into two
parts, “The Film in Germany” and
“The "Film in France.” The rise of
motion pictures in these two coun-
tries is traced from the ‘beginning to
the present.

The complete program for Janu-
ary 14, entitled "Legend and Fan-
tasy,” contains a group of primitive
German “ﬁlms by the pioneer Sklado-
nowsky; “Don Juan's Wedding,” .a
comedy starring Giampetro; “Misun-
derstood,” a melodrama with ‘Henny
Porten, Germany’s most popular ac-
tress; “The Golem,” alegend with ex-
pressionist setting _produced in 1920;
“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” and
“Spring Class?’

Program 2, to be presented Febru-

= ary 11, deals with “The ‘Moving Cam-

era.” ‘One sequence of Holinshed’s
“‘Ham1e‘t,” portrayed by Asta Nielson,
Danish actress, will be shown, to-
gether with “The "Last Laugh,” di-
rected by F. W. Murnau, with -Emil
Jannings. Its creative -use of studio

xmechanics had a marked inﬂuence on ~

-the American ﬁlm.

On ‘March 11 the ‘third program,
“Pabst zand Realism,” will be present-
ed. “The ‘Lovevof Jeanne 'Ney” and
“The 1.Beggar’s Opera,” iboth directed
by G. W. Pabst, will ‘be «run. The
former is.a powerful essay in realism,
with an international setting; the lat-
teriis .a picturization of -‘Kurt eWeile’s

famous opera.
V:-French ﬁlm history is tracediin‘ the

second part of the series, which be-g

gins with -Program 4, April 8, “Frorri
Lumiere to Rene Clair.” A ﬁlm pro-;
duced in 1895 by ¢Louis=Lumiere, the
French pioneer, begins the history. S

Also on the same programare “The
Runaway Horse,” an early “chase”
,ﬁh°n,iin ..which the camera/follows the
subject; “Fantomas,” a serial widely
circulated in Europe. at the sametime
as ;the«ewe1l-known “Perils of Paul-
ine,” was being attended from week
to week by Americans.

Rene Clair’s-ﬁrst ﬁlm, “The Crazy
Ray,” produced in ;1923, will com-
:plete.the fourth program. Mr. Clair

will -be remembered for his subtlei
treatment of Robert Donat’s recentj

“Ghost Goes West.”

[The ﬁnal program of the seriesi

from the Film.Library.will be shown
May 13. ‘Two ﬁlms of special inter-
est to students will complete the se-
ries. Poe’s “The Fall of the House
of Usher,” an essay in the macabre,
directed by Jean Epstein -in 1928, will

Something Crooked Here

More than three teams, besides
co-manager Bailey Blair, will make
the trip. One junior manager will
be added to the retinue, in all prob-
ability. Blair, as junior manager
last year, won the toss that awarded
him the Southern California trip

in December. Thus, when January
1 comes around, Blair will be the
ﬁrst Pitt football manager in his-
tory ever to make two trips to the
Paciﬁc Coast with the team.

Looking forward avidly to the Cal-
ifornia excursion are the sophomores.
Bill Daddio, Biggie Goldberg, and
Fab Hoffman will in all probability
start the big game, and Al Lezouski
and Chick Ohickerneo are slated to
see plenty of action.

But there are other things be-
sides football which the California
trip has to offer. There's the MGM
studio, the Paramount studio, the
Universal studio, and Warner
Brothers. In fact, after the little
business of a Rose Bowl is finished
and done with, the boys have hopes
that pleasant relaxation will be

forthcoming.

The Boys Crash MGM

Goldberg has a deﬁnite date, ac-
cording to Goldberg, with Olivia
D-e Havilland, whom he met in New
York after the Fordham game. Lil’
Abner Daniell, an old hand at this
California business, has a couple on
the string, and Johnny Michelosen
says the trip will be “all right.”
Mike adds that he is “pretty well
pleased” that Pitt got the invitation,
and that the game should be “pretty
good.”

Tony Matisi, still blushing from
his 1935 escapade in New York,
when he got lost on the subways
and wound up in a taxi dance hall
hours after the team was to have
left for Pittsburgh, would say
nothing as to his intended activi-
ties. When the movie colony was
mentioned, he merely sighed and
looked at his calendar.

George Delich and Don Hensley,
veterans of last year’s 12-7 Southern
Cal game, had nothing constructive
to say. They will begin training
again today.

Goldberg Gains
Ground Galore

It’s been a long time since a
sophomore halfback at Pitt has re-
ceived the publicity accorded Mar-
shall “Biggie” Goldberg the past
season.

He’s been written up time and
again in papers, metropolitan and
local, all over the country. Yet it
remained for Bill Croasmun, statis-
tical expert in the athletic office,
to show just how well deserved all
this praise and adulation has been.

“Biggie,” the ﬁgures show, gained
more ground than any backﬁeld
man since the days of the immor-
tal Tommy Davies. Though play-
ing an average of less than 35 min-
utes per game, he gained 1,095
yards all told on scrimmages,
passes and returns of kicks. This
ﬁgure is just a shade under one-
third of the total yardage picked
up by Pitt's ball carriers during a
great season.

Incidentally, when Red Grange
was running wild for Illinois, he
gained only 150 yards more than
Goldberg, while playing an aver-
age of more than 40 minutes per
game.

Year For Panther Harrier Team

Pin Teams

Begin Play

On Local Bowling Alleys
Tomorrow Night

One of the local bowling al-
leys tomorrow night will echo
of Greek bowlers practicing
the art of ten pins made so fa-
mous by the Rip Van Winkle
tale, but this time minus the rum
and Rip’s twenty-year sleep four
fraternity teams open the battle for
the Interfrat crown won last year by

the Phi Delts. As in previous years
the league will be divided into two
groups, six teams in one, seven in the
other, with the winners of each minor
league meeting for the crown.

The only changes made in the en-
tries over last season’s will be the
switching of the Theta Chis into
League B and Pi Kappa Alpha into
League A. Martin J. Feely, director
of Intramural sports, and Mr. Corley,
assistant to the dean of men, have
tried to even the strength of the
leagues as much as possible and have
arrived at the following lineups:

League A——Delts, Lambda Chis,
Phi Eps, Phi Kaps, Pi Lambdas,
SAMS, and PiKAs. League B—Kap-
pa Sigs, Phi Delts, Phi Gams, Theta
Chis, SAEs, and Sigma Chis.

Fallen Stars

Many stars of last year’s edition
of the Interfrat bowling leagues will
be missing and among the shining
lights will be “Jake” Jacobs, who, be-
sides being the high scoring ace of
both leagues, was the leader of the
Lambda Chis who took the lead in
League A.

Johnny Urban’s return to the Phi
Kap lineup may be counted on to be
a potent factor in the Craig Street
house’s powerful machine. Johnny
was one of the most consistent scor-
ers in competition last year, at one
time averaging better than two hun-
dred in two consecutive games. How-
ever, Johnny plays football, and foot-
ball has started practices again, mean-
ing that Jo-hnny will probably not
bowl this season.

Tomorrow night’s schedule ﬁnds Phi
Delts bucking up against Lambda
Chis to inaugurate the series of ﬁrst
nighters. The next fracas is staged
by the Phi Eps and the Phi Kaps fol-
lowed by Pi Lambdas rolling the Sam-
mies. Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta Tau

tivities along the ﬁring line.

Tost, Cook, Leggin Finish
Careers With Honors;
As Team Wins Five

By Lenny Levison :,

A good many snow ﬂakes navel
gone over Flagstaff Hill since the.
last Pitt runner took the Schenleyl
Park hills in stride, but before Coach ;
Carl Olson plunged into the business »
of getting the indoor track opening;
plans in shape, he took time out tol

place a stamp of approval on the‘
1936 Pitt cross-country season.

From the viewpoint of dual meets,
it was a good year. Any season that
shows ﬁve victories and two defeats
in a sport as uncertain as cross-coun-
try, is good in any coach's book of
memoirs.

More signiﬁcant in the retrospec-
tion of the Panther hill and dale year
is the personnel of the Panther team.
Coach Olson's quartet of stars may
be called the bulwark, the mainstay,
or anything else you want to say
about that reliable group that held
the Pitt squad at the top.

Three Stars’ Final

Those four, Harold Tost, Alex Leg-
gin, George Cook, and Albert Zam-
borski, ﬁnished low enough in every
meet to insure the Panthers a cred-
itable score. The fact that these three
seniors and junior Zamborski did so
remarkably well is a tribute to Pitt
cross-country, Coach Olson, and the
boys themselves.

Harold Tost comes from Plumville,
Pennsylvania, and the only real train-
ing he had received in running was
the striding he did around the moun-
tains in them thar parts. For the
last two years Tost has been the in-
dividual star of Pitt cross-country.

Leggin, Cook, and Zamborski had
no experience whatever at high
school. With their consistent scoring
this year, they may be ranked as
among this d«istrict’s best long dis-
tance runners.

Two Straight and Then—-

First meet of the year was at Beth-
any. In that meet Pitt scored a shut-
out victory, winning, 15-40. Finish-
ing in ﬁrst place were Cook, Leggin,
and Zamborski, with hands locked in
a triple tie.

Second meet was at the home
course, the Schenley Park valleys and
hills, against Wayne University of
Detroit. They were beaten in the
same manner, 15-40, with the redoubt-
able trio of Zamborski, Leggin, and
Cook holding hands in their ﬁrst place
ﬁnish.

Michigan State came the next Sat-
urday with an unblemished record
and the national championship under-
neath their running shoes. They went
back with the same. Beating the Pan-
thers, 19-36, they went on later in

Schricker Laments Boxers

Fate As Mitt Veterans
Fail To Return

By Chuck Lynch

“Jock” has the jinx which the Rose
Bowl holds over his Golden Panthers
to worry about. “Doc” hopes to
“win ’em all” even at the price of a
few more gray hairs. And now Box-
ing Coach Schricker shows up with
the “deeply-furrowed brow,” and for
goodreasons, too.

Furrow number one appeared when
A1 Paslowski, George Dines, and Ted

Schmidt, counted upon to form the
nucleus for this year’s te-am, threw
in the towel as far as intercollegiate
boxing is concerned. The football
team’s invitation to roll Bowl-ward
adds another furrow, or at least a
good-sized line, to the boxing men-
tor’s collection as it means that Frank
Patrick, Johnny Michelosen and Al
Lezouski will not change from mole-
skins to tights until January.

Then there was that long Thanks-
giving recess which broke into the
regularity of the drills, and right now
Jack shudders every time he thinks
of trying to get his team “in the
pink” for the opener with Catholic
U. after a three-week layoff at
Christmas.

Schricker forgot to worry long
enough to ask everyone interested in
boxing to see him immediately. “I’m
interested in heavyweights especi-
ally,” he said, “but every boy who
comes out will get practice clothes.”

The annual novice boxing tourney,
usually staged before the holidays,
will not get underway on schedule
this year. Martin J. Feely, director
of intramural activities, with a volley-
ball and bowling tournament on his"
hands that must be run off before
Christmas, has decided to postpone
the tourney until the second week in
January. As soon as the plans are
completed an entry blank will appear
in the News.

Enthusiasm Of Mat Squad

Boosts Mazeski’s Hopes
For Coming Season

 

By Dave Hamilton

Pitt’-s wrestling situation has not
downed Coach Ed Maz-eski. After
meeting the boys for the initial time
this season Friday afternoon in the
boxing gym of the stadium, his ex-
pectations for a good Pitt season
were boosted by the enthusiasm ex-
pressed by those present.

Never in the history of Pitt wres-
tling has a team had what could be
pointed to as a successful season.
Deciding that it is time something
was done about it, Mazeski wants to
bring the boys out of the doldroms
of intercollegiate wrestling by taking
about 50 per cent of the matches and
more if possible. This cannot be
accomplished without material and
material cannot be discovered with-
out a multitude of candidates.

Therefore, Coach Mazeski is issu-
ing a call for plenty of freshman and
sophomore candidates, especially
sophomores. Although there was a
meeting of the veteran candidates
Friday, there is still time to report
for the mat sport as the ﬁrst prac-
tice will be held today.

This year the practice will be con-
ducted directly opposite the way it
has been done in past seasons. It
has been the habit to start instruc-
tion in escapes, but this year the boys
will be initiated in the art of holding!
their men down. The old system pro-
duced a tendency in the grapples to
make too many escapes and not to
do enough holding down.

An intramural mat tourney will be
held as soon as Coach Mazeski can
arrange with Mr. Feely to make plans
for the affair. It will probably be
staged sometime around the 13th of
January after the boxing tourney has
been pounded out. The main objec--
tive is to allow entrants a good time,
but it is hoped that between falls
some talented Wrestlers may be un-

Waite, who later won the individual
national title was ﬁrst in a time of
23 minutes 26 seconds.

In the meet against Carnegie
Tech three weeks later Harold Tost
beat that mark by a couple of husky
strides. He negotiated the four and
a half mile course in a time of 21
minutes 23 seconds, the best time
made over the tough Sc-henley course
this year. Pitt won that meet, beat-
ing the Tartans by an 18-37 score

to Indianapolis to trounce Butler,
25-30.

Highlight of the dual season was
the Penn State meet. Pitt hadn’t
beaten State in 21 years of inter-
school cross-country competition.
State had only lost one meet in three
years. This year Pitt came through
with a 25-30 victory. Harold Tost
finished second behind Olexy, State's
great runner, and Cook, Zamborski,
Leggin, and Johnny Woodruff ended
up among the ﬁrst ten to account for
that triumph.

“Off" The Record

An “off” day in New York resulted
in a ninth place for the Panthers in
the IC4A meet at Van Cortlandt
Park. Tost placed 22nd, after a 14th
position the year before when the
Panthers surprised with a fourth place
in the team standings.

The season was ended at Annapo-
lis where the service team received
a small measure of revenge by nosing
Pitt out over the Navy course, 26-29.

In addition to the four stalwarts
who were so prominent in the rec-
ords, there are a few more names
that may be added to the cross-coun-
try roster of 1936. Johnny Woodrutf
and Frank Bonurati were always way
up there when the points were tabu-
lated. They were the stars of last
year’s undefeated freshman team.
Bob Follette, Ray Nordstrom and Jim
Filson were the other letter winners.

Semi-Finals

Champion Delt Team Upset
By Strong SAM Outﬁt;
Fijis Whip SAEs

By Bob Angros

All possibilities of the Delts re-
peating in the volleyball tourney were
blasted sky high Wednesday evening
on the Trees Gym floor when the
Sammies jostled the champs out of
the running and themselves into the
semi-ﬁnals with a best two out of
three decisions, 16-14, 6-15 and 15-6.

The Delts started slowly and al-

lowed the SAMs to take a command-
ing lead in the ﬁrst tilt but gradually
worked the score into extra tallies,
losing, 16-14. Continuing along at a
merry clip, they breezed through the
tying game, but didn’t have the stam-
ina to repeat and clinch the match.

Phi Gamma Delta, another early
semi-ﬁnalist, gained its position with
a win over Sigma Chi, which offered
only mediocre opposition for the
powerful Fijis.

SAEs Blow Hot, Cold

The SAEs and Phi Gams provided
the tourney with its biggest ﬁreworks
to date as they bitterly fought
through three exciting games before
the Fijis ﬁnally won, 15-13, 6-15 and
15-10. In the ﬁrst game, piling up
a 9-point lead only to blow it in the
closing minutes, the SAEs lost a fu-
rious battle to the Fijis.

SAE had little trouble taking the
second fracas, holding the touch foot-
ball runners up to six tallies. The
third and deciding battle was a torrid
affair with the score being tied six
times before the Phi Gams spurted.

Thus at this stage of the tourna-
ment we ﬁnd the P-hi Gams waiting
the outcome of the Kappa Sig-Phi
Kappa match for their opponent in
the upper bracket semi-ﬁnal. In the
lower bracket SAM battles the vic-
tors of the Phi Delt-Lambda Chi
games. These matches will be run
off tomorrow evening on the Trees
Gym court with the climax of the
tourney being staged Wednesday eve-
nmg.

in the Lounge, had an increase in
attendance over the ﬁrst of the se-
ries of approximately 60 per cent.

their peak. After games of bridge,
roulette, and ping-pong, Toller
showed motion pictures of the pro-
