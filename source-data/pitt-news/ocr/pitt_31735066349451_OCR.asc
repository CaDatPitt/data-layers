QEPAT Hikes Bus Prices
To 50 Cents Monday

BY CONNIE GIEL

The Port Authority Transit
(PAT) yesterday announced a
10-cent fare increase effective
Monday.

City central zone fares will be
raised from 40 to 50 cents, in a

5"‘? ove expected to net PAT an
 additional $4.2 million.

as

The price of the “U” plan, a.
25-ride bus pass‘ designed for
students, will be raised from $7.50
to $9, a 20% increase. The PAT
Board of Directors had planned to
make the U plan $10, but a
presentation by a Pitt student
initiated a proposal for the $1.50
hike instead, PAT official_ Bill
Mattock said.

Pitt Commuter Association Pre-
sident Larry Chaban relayed
student concern over the proposed
increases at PAT’s public hearings
Feb. 13.

“I argued that students wouldn't
e able to pay an extra $0 to $40
during the year just to get to
school,” Chaban said. “But PAT
responded by saying they need
extra income to keep the system
running.”

PAT acting Co-Director Harold
Geissenheimer, after hearing Cha-
ban’s presentation, suggested the
Board make the student rate $9
instead ,of $10.

“The plan is geared for students
with classes on say, Monday,

Wednesdayrand Friday,” Mattock -

said. The plan now costs students
30 cents a ride, and will jump to 36

nts a ride. ~

discount of 10 cents—no other plan
has this,” Mattock said. “This is,
in effect, a free transfer.”

The monthly pass will increase
from $10 to $12.50, plus 10 cents
per ride. “This plan serves daily
commuters,” Mattock said. “The
more you ride, the more you save.”
The monthly pass costs 41 cents a
ride initially. B '

PAT also offers a weekly pass,
the price of which will be increased
from $2.60 to $3.50.

The Board had considered
replacing the monthly and weekly
passes with bi-weekly passes,
Chaban said, but PAT officials said
such a plan is not forthcoming.

Old U plan passes will be
honored, PAT officials said. Tickets
sold through Sunday will be good
until March 31, at which time bus
drivers will collect additional fares.

The Student Union Ticket Office
will be contacted soon and the new
passes will'be distributed within
the week.

Elects FAS

'BudgetRep

BY JOSEPH HASSETT\

The CAS Council elected
Hilary Mandel, a junior liberal
studies major, to the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS) budget
committee on Tuesday.

According to FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg, the budget committee
resulted from a Senate budget
policies committee recommenda-
tion handed down to the Senate
Council and ﬁnally to each school.
That recommendation urged the
individual schools to form their own
budget committees with faculty,
graduate and undergraduate re-
presentation. ,

Although the initial meetings
will be strictly for educational
purposes, the committees’ task
eventually will be to review and
determine budget projections for
their schools.

“Students Should Pay Part'p'

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Pitt's new Board of Trustees
has said students have no right to
expect not to pay a piece of the
increase in the cost of education.

Dr. David Hornbeck, Pennsyl-
vania's deputy secretary of educa-
tion, who met with representatives
of student organizations Monday in
an attempt to ascertain student
opinion of the Board, said

., “Tuitions at Pennsylvania's col-

leges ought to remain as they are,
relatively high and proportional to
the increases in costs.

“The corollary of this is that the
state has the obligation to make
public resources available to
‘students in the form of loans and
grants." he said.

The new trustee said he is not an
advocate of the systems in states
such as New York and California, in
which tuition at state schools is low
or nonexistent.

Hornbeck told the students he
feels the function of the Board is to
establish policies rather than
operate institutions.

“Trustees of major institutions
like the University of Pittsburgh
should have three major foci of

, ,él,,tl‘BV‘I]‘tVl0l]_-_-l'l_SlC£1l, health.-Jconcern,

 

for academic leadership and
attention to quality of student life,”
he said.

As for the question of
increasing student input into the
Board's meetings, Hornbeck said,
“I don't know the answer to that,
but lthink it's fair to say that under
the Sunshine Law. there must be a
certain degree of publicity of the
fact that the Board is meeting and
some sort of statement of the
agenda made.

“In that context. -the Board is not
legally required to allow the public
to speak," he said. ‘‘I don't know
Pitt's practices, but I've always
given those who have showed up
the right to speak."

Hornbeck said he doesn't know a
lot about the University, “and so I
want to spend a healthy hunk of
time trying in the best way possible
to ﬁnd out what students think the
Board of Trustees_ should be all
about." .

As for the issue of faculty
unionization at Pitt, Hornbeck sees
collective bargaining as a positive
thing.
mistake of trying to narrow
collective bargaining down to

wages‘. hours and working condi- '
tions. But. creative things ‘can be},

   

done with regard to tenure and
official actions via the contract,”
Hornbeck said.

Students, however, have nothing
to say about faculty unionization in
a legal sense, Hornbeck said.

' Hornbeck contrasted Pitt’s grad-
uate schools with those at the state
colleges.

“We think it is a mistake for
there to be a Ph.D program at
Indiana University. In contrast, we
feel that graduate programs are
very much a part of Pitt's
mission." he said.

“There should be a greater
emphasis on research here than at
the state colleges, which should
remain basic undergraduate teach-
ing universities.

“This is not to say. however, the
undergraduate teaching at Pitt
should suffer in respect to graduate
programs," he said.

“ Hornbeck is representing Secre-
tary of Education John Pittenger,
who serves ex-ofﬁcio on the Board.

Unions'Main Enemy

May Be Themselves

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

With the faculty union elec-
tions coming up in early March, it
seems the unions have nothing to

fear but unionization itself. It‘

seems to be a growing concern that
although the anti-union vote will be
consolidated, the pro-union votes
in the Provost's area will be split
three ways. .

Of the .ﬁve bargaining units, or
communities of labor interest,
created by the recent State Labor
Board ruling, only one—the Pro-
vost's area—will be the scene of an
all-out campaign drive. The Law
School and Medical School units
generally have been conceded by
the unions. and in the Graduate
Schools of Public Health unit, only
two unions are competing. The
Dental School unit will not be able
to vote.

NEWS ANALYSIS

In the Provost's area. there are
661 eligible voters. The three

In order for any union to win,‘ it

must capture more than 50% of the
vote, that is, approximately 340
ballots in the Provost's area.
Because each union has mounted a
campaign, it is unclear what union
will get a clear victory on the ﬁrst
ballot. . « .
In a recent survejupublished in
The Chronicle of Higher Education,
authored by Seymour Lipsett and
Everett Ladd, the research showed
nationwide that while some 72% of

faculty voting would support—

unionization, only 25% of the
faculty polled were actually union-

pro-union vote. badly split between.

surmount anti-union sentiment.

The Law School Admissions Test
(LSAT) will continue to -play a
major role in determining admis-
sion to law school. primarily as a
result of increased enrollments and
the need for an objective measure-
ment of student capabilities,
according to- Robert Harper,
assistant dean of the Pitt Law
SchooL

More than 112,000 prospective
law students take the exam each
year jostling for an estimated

37,000 positions in the nation's 160. ‘

of the test results, since many
entrepreneurs claim enrollment in

anyone for the exam and boost his
score. This would increase his
chances for admission accordingly.

Nevertheless, Pitt ﬁnds the tests

LSAT will continue to be used in
the foreseeable future,” he added.
“We will receive over 1,500
applications for 230 positions in the
ﬁrst-year class. We need some sort
of yardstick to select these
individuals.”- ’

He cited the impossibility of
interviewing all the candidates for
admission, as well as the over-

'V’/“ﬁelming amount of information
 at would have to be amassed-

under any other system.

In addition, Harper noted the
need for, accountability in the
admissions process. “As a
state-related institution, we must
be as objective as possible, and
need to be able to explain to
applicants why they were accepted
on rejected. ,

_"‘We publish our mean scores

The admission service maintains
that since “the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop

gradually and types ofknowledge,

that one accumulates over relativ-
ely long periodsof time, no speciﬁc
preparations can be made for the

for $85, which entitles one to 20
hours of instruction by attorneys.

Harper, who received his under-
graduate and law degrees at Pitt,
said, “The courses make you feel
good...if you have re money, take
the class. It ill help your
self-conﬁdence, but you’ll get no_
more from it than you would from
applying self-discipline." S

He explained that after a person
registers for the test, he receives a ~
sample exam that “should give you
a fairly good idea” of. what the test

"70 Years of Collegiate Jaurn_aIism at me University of Pittsburgh"

   A Well-Earned Break...

With the Port Authority Transit’s (PAT) ‘fare increase approved
yesterday by its Board of Directors, Pitt students—particularly

9 _ .commuters—have nothing about which to cheer.

V On Monday, as a result of the hike, base fares will jump from 40
cents to 50 cents, and the price of the 25-ride “U” tickets will increase
from_$7.,50 to $9. There also will be other increases.

Originally, the price of the “U” tickets, which are used by most of

- Pitt’s commuters, was to increase 30% to $10. But Harold

. Geissenheimer, acting co-director of PAT, said Pitt Commuter

Association President Larry Chaban made such a convincing
presentation he felt the increase for students should not be so sharp.
That leaves a good many commuters owing Chaban at least a pat on
the back. And while we're at it, a few good words should be said about
Geissenheimer’s openness during the public hearing. .
It wouldn’t take much to make a case against paying an extra $30 to
$40 just to get to school, as long as the case were being made before a

/ group of students. But when Chaban made his point before a team of

directors whose aim is to balance a multi-million dollar budget, one
‘would expect the relative pittance to carry no weight with PAT.
V Surprisingly, yesterday’s announcements is proof that it did.’

  ...Another on the Way

4 While most eyes are on Harrisburg these days waiting for Pitt’s state
appropriation to ﬁnd its way through the Commonwealth’s ﬁnancial
maze, two bills before the U.S. Congress are bound to have just as
much effect on many students’ education bills as anything that comes "

out of the state capital. .

What is being examinedare two provisions of the Basic Education

Opportunity Grant.

House Bill 2471 is seeking approval of the clause that limits the grant
to no more than half of the recipient’s total cost of schooling. ‘It also

 It's Just a Matter of Time

BY TOMHWASELESKI ’

March 9-10, 1976: Pitt faculty
ﬁnally take to the polls to decide
the unionization issue. The three
unions have waged a bitter and

Provost’s area, which includes
professors in the College of Arts

There are three simple reasons
why a faculty union is needed at

to the conclusion that the argu-
ments of the TIF are a curiously
tortured defense of the status quo

point to be made with respect to the
TIF is that “no agent" is an

ment. A vote for “no agent" is a
vote for the management to

There is only one organization
that meets these requirements, the
Pennsylvania State Education As-

PSEA/NEA represents more col-
ege and university faculty mem-
bers. including those at four-year
institutions. than either of the
competing organizations. For this

negotiated, it must be enforced or
it becomes a dead letter. The
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) is also making a
virtue of its close relationship with
the administration at Temple. It
boasts it never has been necessary
to go to outside arbitration under
the Temple contract. Anyone who
understands university adminis-
trations and collective bargaining
will wonder whether the AAUP is

' Vincent Canby, THE NEW YORK TIMES: "The Middle of the World, Alain Tanner's fine new film about the love
1 affair of an upwardly mobile Swiss engineer and a beautiful and profoundly sel-aware Italian emigrant, covers exactly
112 days. The fascination of "The Middle of the World" has less to do with what happens than with Tanner's style
and the extraordinary amount of ground he manages to cover with such eliptical ease. "The Middle of the World” is in
many ways a more fully realized demonstration of what may now be identified as the new king of cinema narrative .
used in his "La Sa|amandre" (1972). It is up to us to differentiate truth from falsehood or self-deception. Paul is run-

H PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

“The Big Lie” For Studying

BY MAGGIE MCKAY

Every student knows what
proper study habits, are, but now
many really care enough to
cultivate them.

Besides the time-worn admoni-
tion to study in a quiet, well-lighted
room, there are a few potentially
interesting study, techniques that
help students prepare for tests.

The Learning Skills Center on
the ﬁfth floor of the Student Union,
open to all Pitt students, conducts
study skills sessions and reading
clinics year-round.

Volunteersfrom the center have

worked with entire classes, such as
some of the Freshmen Studies
courses. .
According to Center coordinator
Susan Schiller, students must first
convince themselves they want to
study, repeating “I want to study”

‘until they believe it. This is called

 

r“— ‘F_l§_l_E_E‘—_'-'_—"7i

“The Big Lie.”

If and when “The Big Lie” fails,
a student should try behavior
modification, setting a small goal
and promising himself a reward
upon achieving it—a' two-hour
break perhaps.

But one of the most important
things for students to do, according
to Schiller, is to plan studying
times. around their own biorhy-
thms. “People shouldn’t feel guilty

_about studying better at 3 a.m.,”
‘Schiller said. . ,
Also, if studying in your room, or

the library, makes you nervous,
Schiler recommends studying in
the room where the test will be
given. “One will associate the
subject matter with the room, while
simulating the testing environ-
ment,” she said. V

W/hen cramming for an exam,
never try to study without taking
breaks. Breaks are essential to curb
forgetting. '

If you haven’t read much of the

' course material, look at the titles

and subtitles in the books.
Concentrate only on general

concepts and avoid getting bogged _

down in details. Think of details
only as they support major
concepts.

Of all the aides students devise
while studying, repetition is the
least effective. “Make up bizarre
images and associations,” Schiller
said. “Find patterns and similari-
ties in the material-”

Group studying is helpful only

~ when everyone has done some

studying and "no one person is
teaching the whole group.
Alwaysﬁnd out what kind of test
is going to be given. Find out what
can just be memorized. Make up
questions in advance. “It’s harder
to make an intelligent question
than to answer one,” Schiller said.
When going into.a test, “keep

.trying to get an image of yourself

acing the test,” she said. ‘Taking a
candy bar, or any high energy food
along, also helps.

There are ‘certain things one

-should remember before taking

either an objective or an essay test.
It may be cold comfort, but most
objective tests contain a few

questions that every student in the,

class will miss. Some test makers
claim that a test on which students

score a 100% is a bad test.

Also. studies have proved that
students who score highest on
objective tests review as though
they were preparing for an essay
test.

The most self-defeating ap-
proach to objective tests is to look

for physical patterns in series of I

answers. Most tests are deliber-
ately designed to avoid such
patterns.

As for guessing on an objective I

test, the answer is a qualified “why

not?" If the score of the test is

simply the number of. right
answers, playing hunches becomes
safer than if one is penalized for
guessing by a scoring system which

includes an “over-corrections for

chance.” _

As for guessing techniques, the
Learning Skills Center has devised
some, but those interested in them

will have to go up to the Center.

because, “I’m afraid that if the
people who make up tests see them
in print,‘ they will change their
tests,” Schiller said.

Be careful when guessing. Don’t
guess too soon. Read ‘all possible

answers, selectin not just a correct ~

answer, but the best answer.
When dealing with essay tests,
you should make sure that you
understand the question. Try to
restate it in your own words. Guard

in love with the 
prostitute Mildred‘?_” Bad Answer; A

 

BY GEDRGENE KALEINA

“It's hard to talk about my life

I without my work since I live and

breathe it...I am consumed by my

job.".

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, the
iron hand behind many decisions at
Pitt, barely has» time to relax at
lunch on a typical afternoon.

He is known simply as the one

E  -who's holding the reins. But there
 is an unknown side to him.

He leaned back carefully in the
red vinyl chair of the restaurant

and impatiently glanced at his

watch. Posvar’s head bobbed from
side to side, looking for the
waitress. '
“Have a meeting at Heinz Hall
after this,” he blurted out, as the
short, plump waitress peered

. around his shoulder.

 “We’ll have two tenderloin-tip

. teriyaki, and I'll have a glass of

iced tea,” he said, throwing me a
glance ,to ascertain my choice of
beverage.

Posvar ﬁnally seemed to relax in
his chair.

Aside from the hectic meetings,
receptions and luncheons that

« Posvar frequents, there are more
relaxed periods. such as this one. another in his chauffer-driven car,

What are his other interests?
They are as diverse as the many

 

Posvar is constantly keeping up
with the many tasks confronting
him as -the 15th chancellor of the

Cities in which he has lived during
his 50 years.

“I love to travel, but most of it is
to infamous places like Harris-
burg," he said with a chuckle, as
he glanced around the room.
“Most of the time when I travel, I
wear everyone out. Like the time
my wife and I went to Africa...We
went to 10 countries in 20 days and
she was exhausted by the middle of
the trip."

Although the Posvars are well-
traveled, they consider Pittsburgh
their home. “My wife and I were
raised in Cleveland, and Pittsburgh
has that Midwest quality about it.
The people are nice and it is

culturally what we need. Besides,

we are only an hour by plane from
places like Washington, New York
and Boston.

Pittsburgh is the Posvars’ second
favorite (‘it_\'——aftCr Boston. Posvar
also has lived in New York, Florida,
Washington, D.C., Colorado and
Oxford, England. “New York is
too congested, ' Colorado is too
isolated and Washington is such a
changing city...there’s no perma-
nence there,” he said as he gulped
down the last of the split pea soup.

The teriyaki finally arrived and
Posvar settled down to the business
of eating, with a napkin placed
carefully on his lap. “I eat too
fast," he said as he scooped up a
forkful of spinach casserole. “My

wife does, too. I guess [could slow 

down if I forced myself."

He_was right. He had managed
more of the teriyaki than I had.

Posvar’s other interests range
from music to tennis to carpentry.

“I follow music because of my
wife's career," Posvar explained,
glancing at his watch. His wife,
Mildred Miller, is an internation-
ally“known mezzo-soprano with the
Metropolitan Opera Company.’

“My wife managed to balance a
career with raising three children,”
he pointed out. -“We have always
maintained the thought that you
can raise children and still have
your career."

The Posvars have three childrenf
Wesley, 25, Marina, 2], and Lisa,
15. “My wife is a very active
person, too, but I think somehow
our children managed to acquire a
tranquility about them," Posvar
said. “Like the time my son
brought home a B and Itold him he
should raise it. He asked me why,
and I couldn't answer him. With
me, I've ‘always been competitive
by nature, I guess.”

' After the hustle and bustle of
paperwork and decisions, Posvar
likes to "move to more relaxing
activities like carpentry. “I love to
work with my hands and build
things. I've already ﬁnished off

three basements,” Posvar said. ’
Posvar is also an active skier. “I " ‘ '

took it up 12 years ago but can't
find the time to do it anymore.”

One of Posvar’s avocations is
writing. “I love to write, and one
of my greatest frustrations is that I
don’t have enough time for

_ writing," he said.

Finishing lunch, Posvar glanced
quickly at‘ his watch. and looked
around for the waitress.

“Have to stop in at that meeting
for aifew minutes,” he said, as he
seemed to calculate exactly how
long he would spend there. A

“Need a ride back to campus?”

he asked.

Consumed by his job? Maybe. K

But he doesn’t seem to lose track of
the avocations that give him the
chance to unwind from the high
pressures of‘his demanding job as
chancellor.

Rick Kilburn on bass—'—a substitute
for Chris Brubeck whenever the

" The band performed some
numbers from its two albums and

makes it so interesting is how each

predict the direction the music will
take. This resulted in very
effective improvisations enabling
the members of the band to express
themselves without losing their
rhythmic unity.

Brubeck was joined by Paul

that, he hasn’t made a dent in the
States despite several albums,
among them, Berlin, which Reed
claimed would be the Sgt. Pepper
of the ’70s. Now we know the
validity of that boast. _
Reed is more adept at lyrics than
music, as his latest album attests.

'Whereas most artists “sing,” Reed

“vocalizes”—for lack of a better
word. He is more conversational,
more interested in expressing
emotion in a lyric than with poetry.

For instance, in “Kicks,” a song
that concerns itself with slashing
human bodies for—you guessed

l it—kicks, Reed sings the part of thtgg

obsessed deviant: “I needa-needa‘ , 

needa some kicks. Gimme-gimme’-

Sculpture, too, makes an impres-

Warner Wada, a studio arts

for his two-panel painting, "Untit-

The panels resemble hammered
copper with horizontal lines scrap-
ed across the surface while the
paint was still wet. These lines,
which look like Arabic writing
made with a brush or finger, are
echoed on the copper and off-white

frames each panel.

method is similar to metal
flakc—painting done on cars.

Wada's subjects come from his
architectural photos of building
details such as windows or a
section of a wall. Instead of
painting directly from his photos.
he takes ideas from them that he
abstracts in his paintings.

The Jury Award was also
presented to studio arts professor
Christina Floyd for her painting,
“Untitled."

Her large black and silver
painting is one in a series of three
also on exhibit. The series can be
read from beginning to end as a
process of modular elements
repeated differently. achieving
different effects. Rectangular
shapes overlap, collide and pene-
trate each other as they move
seemingly in space.

Floyd eliminates color from her
works because it interferes with the
spatial elements she wants to
achieve. She uses silver instead of
white, since it functions as a light
gray tone and has reflective
properties.

Transparent gell medium further
adds to her complex system of
interweaving space. Floyd paints
certain rectangles with the medium
that causes the shapes to appear
and disappear as the viewer walks
around the picture.

The gcll, which becomes cloudy
if thickly applied. creates a unique
surface texture seen as a series of
vertical lines or as stucco-like
patches.

Balance is the problem sculpture
Thomas Brunger challenges in his
corrugated aluminum “Split-
Rebound." I-le stretches his 2x2
thin-beamed rectangular piece 12
feet high. But the dangerous
height is compensated for bv lower.
heavy 4x.4 logs that jut out on one
side. The metal logs break the
straight line of his piece, lending
excitement to his work.

The piece is visually light.
though precarious, and is balanced
by a hair’s breadth.

By contrast, his second sculpture
is solid and sits close to the ﬂoor.
It's titled “Warp," and looks like
an aluminum loom. The emphasis
here is the rythmical pattern set
up by the zigzag crossbars. It is as
if an ocean of chooppy steel waves
are barely contained by the
sandbox-like border of the loom.

Brunger, like the other Studio
Arts aitists represented, display
fresh solutions to old problems.
Many of the techniques reviewed
here are a result of personal
pioneering. Their contribution to
the exhibition is noteworthy.

poignant. Using a lazy guitar for
backup, he sings straightforwardly;
no theatrics here. It could verv well

 

crack the AM it’s so
pop—influenced.

Some of the best guitar work on
the album appears on “She’s My
Best Friend.” A little on the fuzzy
side, with heavy bass-—-this’ll take
you back a few years to some ofthe
strumming from the Beatles’
middle period.

In the same vein as “Kicks’.' is
“A Gift,” a tune in which Reed
repeats quite conﬁdently, “I’m just
a gift to the women of this
world"—certainly not an oppor-
tunity for slobbering drivel, but
rather one for soft-spoken repeti-
tion—you could almost see him
sitting before a mirror combing his

charts,

locks.

The title track, which closes the
album and is also the longest piece
(6:35), is a wreck. Itjust sits on the
turntable waiting to be digested, a
rambling, monotonous tune that
cannot be enjoyed for either its
words or its music.

Since Lou Reed has a small,
dedicated cult of followers, he can
take chancesion songs like this,
without running the risk of

alienating some fans. Perhaps this
is one of the little obsessions of
obsessionist music.

night at the Field House, the

Panthers spotted the Indiana‘

University of Pennsylvania Indians
12 points and 25 minutes before
they turned‘ the tables and ran
away with a resounding 76-61

  Richards: Tough, Season

BY YAIER LEHRER

The wall above his bed is.
plastered with pictures of famous '

NBA and ABA stars——John Havli-
cek of the Celtics; Billy Knight, a

former . Pitt teammate and now,

second-leading scorer in the ABA.

There also stands a homemade

basketball-shaped clock with the.

word “Pitt” embellishing its base.
The, atmosphere is one of total

 basketball, -an atmosphere that

/‘P, ‘
"-.‘:;*:e

?..=\J_"
rm '-

.iJ;’;"

indicates the kind of person Tom
Richards is.

The injury-ridden point-guard’s
career started at family gatherings,
where Richards’ devotion to the
sport probably was learned through
osmosis. '

“One of my"uncles played on the
state championship team at Ali-
quippa, another played for Geneva

and another played for Washington -

and Jefferson,” the senior re-
called. “so when my father and
them would get together, you can
imagine what the topic of conver-
sation would invariably be.”

“My father never pushed me
towardsit, though,” he said. “It
was just something I wanted to
do.”

Richards started in all but two
basketball games from his sopho-
more year at Moon Township High
School until his injury in the ﬁrst
West Virginia Game this season,
when WVU’s Stan Boskovich
wrapped ‘Richards around a Field
House basket support.

Richards was hoping for a good
season to impress the professional
scouts, and although his season has
been anything but a banner one,
he’s still hoping.

“I was playing with a wrist injury
at the beginning of the season,”
said the hero of the Ohio University
game. “I’d never been hurt before

’ and it forced me tolearn a lot and

to keep a positive attitude about
it.”

Richards’ desperation shot from
two steps inside half court at the
ﬁnal buzzer gave the Panthers a
one-point victory over Ohio.

‘‘At ’first I didn’t know it went
in,” Richards said,“but then
everyone started jumping up and
down. It happened so fast, I just
couldn't believe it.”

That was probably Richards’ -

biggest thrill this season, but as far
as his Pitt career goes, there have
been a lot more highlights. ’

He was the starting guard on two
tournament tea,ms—the NCAA in
1974, and the NIT in 1975. It was in
the NCAA tournament that Pitt

reached the semiﬁnals before
losing to North Carolina State,
which became the No. 1 team in the
country. A

“My parents came down to
watch that game,” Richards said.
“They’ve been watching me play

‘since I was in fourth grade. At any

game that is not too far‘—away, like
California (Pa.), you can usually-
ﬁnd my parents there.”

 

made the best of a disappointing season.

Richards. hopes to play in the
professional ranks but realizes that
the road will be a rough one.

“With the season I've had, the
chances are pretty slim,” he said.
“But a couple of teams expressed
interest in me in the beginning of
the season, and if they don’t work
out, I can try out in Europe.”

“I realize the chances are slim,”
he said, “but it’s the kind of thing
that if I don’t try, I’ll always be
bothered by the nagging thought
that I might have been a

professional basketball player.”

And for a person as devoted to
his sport as Richards is, that
nagging thought could drive him

crazy. _
There is another way out,
though, and it’s a way that

Richards has been thinking about
more and more.

“A lot of people ask me_ifl would
go into. coaching,” he said. .‘‘It
would be hard because my
undergraduate work hasn’t been

focused on that. But I’m sure I
would be a good coach.

“I know .I’ll end up coaching
somewhere, even if it’s volunteer
work for a sixth-grade elementary-
school team,” he said. “Too many
people have helped me for me not
to help other people in basketball. ”

So whether it be on the

basketball ﬂoor shooting hoops or °

on the bench guiding other players,

Wilson photo

Richards’ devotion to basketball
will not let him give up the sport he
loves so much. He feels he owes a
debt to basketball, and Richards is
not one to renege on his debts.

Perhaps a sign of hope in their

There was a difference this time.

season, 17, at a time when none of
the other Panthers could buy a
basket. '

Down by 12 points with less than
16 minutes to go in the game, the
Cats came alive. Within six
minutes, the Panthers assumed the .
lead. And before the final buzzer,
Pitt had outscored the Indians,
50-29, clinching its 11th win
against 15 losses.’-

The Panthers managed to turn a
lackluster game into an exciting
contest, pulling a respectable win
from the jaws of what could have

defeat.

Pitt Announces  

23 Football Recruits I 

BY CRIS HALL

Pitt football coach Johnny
Majors announced yesterday the

[names of 23 prospective Panthers

who have-signed national letters of
intent to attend Pitt this fall.
“Overall, I'm pleased_——we had" a
good year,” he said. ,

Included in this bevy of high
school standouts are 12 Pennsyl-
vanians, including two AP all-Sta-

ters (Penn “State's Joe Paterno has“

just announced the signing of nine
all-Staters, includingjew Castle
linebacker Bruce Clarke)« and a
New Yorker who is being touted as
Pltt's next star runner.

“We had some pleasant surpri-‘

ses at the end that assured us
holding our own with anybody,”
Majors said. “OKur recruitment
has been consistent over the
four-year period, and I’m pleased
with the continuing positive and
optimistic response to our pro-
gram." - -

Majors also hinted of one or two
additional recruits but failed to
elaborate.

Defensive end Steve Fedell, a
first-team selection on the
WPlAL’s and AP’s all-State squad,
will come to Pitt from Pittsburgh's
North Hills High School, while
second-team all-WPIAL, all-Stater
John Falvo, from nearby Richland,
also has opted for the Blue and
Cold.-

Fedell played linebacker for the
North Hills Indians and earned
three varsity letters there, but was

recognized. by the , AP as a

defensive end. Falvo, a Coach and

Athlete all-American, ran the—_:.‘
100-yard dash and threw the -shot. .-

for the Richland track team.

Prep all-American Bob Hightow-I ~-

er, from Buffalo, N.Y., will come to

Pitt with a reputation as ‘a true :;’.“:';.t

breakaway threat with impressive

. credentials. At 6-2, 190, Hightow-“ 
er runs "the 40_to 4.5_and has 

high-jumped 6-4.

Other all-WPIAL performers to
select Pitt include, Monessen

halfback Jo Jo Heath, named to the "

Pennsylvania squad for the Big 33
game, Beaver High middle guard
Ken Anderson,

J anov, who won all-WPIAL honors

at tight end and honorable mention  .
all-State honors at defensive back, - ' ‘

Upper St. Clair two-way tackle
Kurt Brechbill, who was also
all-American, all-State, and a Bilg
33 selection, Monessen halfback
Bob Rechichar, and Monaca back
Scott McKee], who was the WPIAL
Class A MVP and a UPI all-State
pick.

While Majors is quick to note
“You never really know what kind

of a recruiting year you had until ‘

four years later,” it appear certain
tnat ne once again has produced in
the area in which he most excels.
A complete list of the recruits
can be found on page 14 of today’s
Pitt News. '

    Gymnasts Host PSU

The Pitt gymnastics team, 0-5

the underclassmen are going to do.
But people like Skip Bolin, Kevin

Nellis and Bill Bailey did very well .

for us.”

The underclassmen_ aren’t the
only ones that _did.well; Dallatore
posted a 9-5 record (pretty good for
someone who had been slowed by
an infected ﬁnger most of the
second half of the,season), and
along with Bob Bailey and Bill
Korth helped provide the leader-
ship and attitude sorely needed on
what used to be a lackluster team,

“We have basically an ‘I-want-

to-do-better attitude,’ ” explained’

Dallatore. “Last year that attitude
just wasn't there.

“This is the best team I've
wrestled on—as far as attitude is
concerned," he continued, “and as
for ability—we’re getting better
every year."

That's obvious. Pitt's record is
much more impressive than last
year's, especially when you consi-
der the ‘opposition the Panthers
faced—Navy, Michigan and Penn
State. - But surprisingly, Dallatore
feels that Pitt could have done
better. I V

operation and should be ab1e_,to
help the Panthers’ ﬁnal efforts.

It’s been a dismal season for
_what was the most improved team
in the country in 1974, and the only
place to look is the future if injuries
heal and especially if recruiting is
successful. But successful recruit-
ing depends heavily on the amount
of scholarships doled out, and
grants have not exactly . been
showered upon the ‘gymnastics
department. ,

“With all the effort these guys
are putting out,” Perez said, “if we
only had more than two scholar-

ships per fur years, we could be’

national contenders—-our track
record proves that.”

 

rTourney

“Really, we only should have
lost one or two matches," he said.
“But a lot of guys got hurt, so- we
had only about 14 wrestlers‘
healthy—and 10 had to start.

“But you always think you
should do better. After we got
going, we were disappointed we
lost meets like Millersville State
and Clarion.”

All those dual meets are behind
the Panthers now. What they must
concentrate on is the Eastern
Wrestling League Tournament (on
Friday and Saturday), the stepping
stone to the NCAA Championships
and a national title.

Dallatore is conﬁdent his team
will do well.

“We lost a really bad match at
Penn State," he said, “and people
think that loss will carry over to the
tournament. But the guys will
really come on strong.

“They feel they can win the
tournament—not place,,but win.
They're working out pretty hard. I
think we'll surprise a lot of
people.”.

And what Dallatore thinks holds '

a lét of validity; after all, he has

.more experience wrestling than

Pitt has engineering students.

Dallatore was a two-time Section
3 champ in the WPIAL, not to
mention a Western Conference and
WPIAL Qualiﬁers champ, WPIAL
Section Regional champ,“ and
(whew!) State champ in 1972. He
compiled a S4-5-2 record in his last

two years at Trinity High School. V

So he knows what he's ‘talking
about.

“There are a lot of good teams in
the nation,” he said, “but I think
Pitt will easily qualify for the Top
20." ,

Especially with that powerful
midweight lineup.

  Intramural Wrestling  

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

The intramural swimming com-
petition will get underway this
evening at Trees Pool. According
to the intramural ofﬁce, .the
Competition will begin at 7.

On March 15, 40 to 50 teams will

compete in the Intramural basket-,

ball tournament. All those
ﬁrst-half leaders, the names of
which previously were published in
The Pitt News, already have
qualiﬁed for the tournament.
Teams that win or tie for the
divisional lead in the second‘ half of
the season also will be eligible.
The intramural wrestling compe-
tition, scheduled for last night,
never really got off the ground.
Eliminations for independent and
fraternity championships were
decided last week, so the competi-
tion last night was to have been for
an all-campus team. Because
many of the competitors were
either sick'or mysteriously missing

from the event, there will’ be no
all-campus team. '

These are the ﬁnal fraternity
competition standings: Phi Gamma
