Panhellenic Ball To Take Place
April 27 In Century Club;
Banquet March 22

 

Rules and regulations for the W0-
men’s fraternity rushing season ex-
tending from Thursday, February 22,
to Saturday, February 24, were the
main subjects of discussion at a meet-
ing of Panhellenic council that took
place last Thursday evening in the
Heinz House.

A new ruling passed by council this
year is the provision that a printed
form must be enclosed with the invi-
tations to the Saturday night parties.
The rushee will ﬁll out the blank, ac-
cepting or refusing the invitation, and
place it in the fraternity mail box not
later than 5 o’clock, Friday, February
23. This ruling, together with other
rushing regulations, was explained to
non-fraternity women at the freshman
educational gatherings sponsored last
Friday afternoon by Panhellenic coun-
cil.

Invitations to Thursday and Friday
rushing affairs are being ma.iled today
from the office of Miss Adah Borgerd-
ing, secretary of vocational education.

In accordance with a motion passed
at the meeting on Thursday evening,
a. formal banquet to take place March
22 in Heinz House will be attended by
all fraternity women on campus. Last
year’s traditional fraternity affair was
in the form of a formal tea.

Betty Quarrie, C34, social chairman
of Panhellenic council, announced
that the Twentieth Century club has
been secured for the annual Panliel-
lenic ball to take place on April 27.

CWA Men Ruin Story; I
Frenchmen Can’t
“Parlez-Vous”

By Edna Horvitz

The idea was a good one! It
would have made a swell feature
story——if it had only worked out.

The intention was to interview
the Italian, Polish, Jewish, Hun-
garian, Slavish, Russian, Scotch,
Welsh, Irish, German, Swedish,
French, Dutch, Serbian, and
Syrian CWA workers employed
on the Cathedral and obtain from
them statements in their native
language as to what they thought
of the CWA, The only difficulty
was that the Frenchman couldn’t
write French, that the Welshman
couldn’t write Welsh, etc.

-Vincent Diulus, Italian, was the
only one who complied with the
request to write something in his
native language. He wrote: “Il
sistemo del CWA per noi operaia
e una cosa buonissima.”

Pat Gavin, Irish, said, “I think
it’s ﬁne, I’ve been out of work
for a year and a half. The CWA
gives men $5.60 a day.”

L. J. Schwarzmeier, Dutch,
said: “It helped us all out, It
makes you realize you’re in this
world for something. Before, I
didn’t know where things for the
next day were coming from.”

And so, they expressed them-
selves in favor of the CWA, but it
was a blow, a disappointment to
learn that We couldn’t print their
opinions in their own language.

Three Secret Sessions
Hold Fate Of Campus
Government

 

The operations of a committee of
14 students and faculty and adminis-
tration members who are to consider
recommendations for changes in stu-
dent government will not be released
for publication until deﬁnite proposals
are laid before Student council at a
future meeting.

Behind closed doors in secret ses-
sion, the committee has had three
meetings and there has been no rev-
elation of any suggested changes in
student government D11 the campus.
No reports whatsoever are available
for the information of students on the
campus and none will be made until
a time when the committee feels that
it has something deﬁnite to report, it
was learned recently.

Acting upon the presentation of a
petition signed by 50 students which
called for a change in campus student
government, tudent council organ-
ized the committee of eight students
and six faculty members to consider
the charges against the present legis-
lative organization and to weigh pos-
sibilities of changes in that organiza-
tion.

The group was formed during the
week before examinations and has
been in active session behind closed
doors since. It is intimated that, fol-
lowing another meeting of the group
due this week or next, deﬁnite reports
will be made to Student council and
will be available for publication in
the Pitt News.

Three years ago an attempt at the or-
ganization of a Men’s Self Government
Association to strengthen campus leg-
islative procedure failed. The present
council has faced criticism this year
due largely to the actions of commit-
tees which it had appointed,

The" members of the committee
which is considering the recommenda-
tions for legislative changes are:
,John McParland, D34, president of
Student council; John D. Paulus, C34,

Ethics Of Local Financial And

Industrial :Leaders

W15 Flynn decries. all “beyond the
law” dealings of American rich men,

“Wealthy men, who held every im-
portant post in the national govern-
ment during the late twenties,” he
,declared, “must be blamed for the
idepression into which they plunged
'us.”

The American idea that wealth
brings wisdom has penetrated univer-
sities throughout the country, de-
clared the author of “Investment
Trusts Gone W'rong.” During the past
few years, he declared many men
awarded LL. D.. degrees by colleges
have had no other talent than that
for amassing riches,

“Particularly social science depart-
ments in our schools have come under
the inﬂuence of rich men and their
ideas,” said Mr. Flynn. “There is no
actual censorship of opinions, but
wealthy men do exercise a guiding
hand over the thoughts expressed by
many of our educators.”

Author of a recent article entitled,
“Scrap ﬁe NRA,” Mr, Flynn does not
believe that appropriations for CWA
work will be discontinued soon. “Con-
gress wi_l_l not permit the President to

stop the CVVA projects,” he said, and
agreed that like the English dole, the
work relief expenditures in the United
States could with difficulty be our-
tailed.

Asked what socially productive
projects he would recommend for the
national government to undertake as
a depression remedy, the writer
recommended large—scale housing.
“The housing ﬁeld,” he emphasized,
“is the most unexplored market in
the country. Slum clearance pro-
grams wjll, in addition, return to us
a moderate degree of prosperity for
a time.”

But Flynn adds that no one remedy

,can, under present forms of capi-

talism, give the nat.ion permanent
prosperity, He favors regulation of
corporate abuses and of stock ex-
change speculation as measures of
relief from the worst features of

America’s economic life.

Number Of Tappees,
Election Rules
Altered

Druids, sophomore men’s honorary
fraternity, adopted a revised form of
its constitution after considerable dis-
cussion and argument at the ﬁrst
regular meeting of the new semester
last Thursday. The new document
has succeeded in clarifying many
points which had led to controversy
in the past and allows for a better
method of governing in the body, ac-
cording to Edward Durkin, president.

One of the principal changes in the
constitution concerns the number of
tappees to be inducted each year.
Druids has always tapped 12 men at
the spring ceremonies and three at
the fall tapping. Under the present
laws, the number of tappees may not
exceed 15 during the year but the
quota does not have to- be ﬁlled if a
sufficient number of candidates is not
found to merit the recognition.

The method of election was also re-
vised. The old system of an involved
voting arrangement has been discard-
ed in favor of the simpler system of
majority voting, Also in connection
with the voting rule, a section has
been added to the constitution which
allows only those active members to
vote who have attended more than
one—half of the regular meetings.

Other changes include giving the
Druid group the right to dismiss a
member who conducts himself in a
manner proving his unwillingness to
remain active with the organization
during his full sophomore year.

A unanimous vote authorized James
Ballantyne, C, secretary, to invite
delegates from all chapters of Druids
to a convention in this city at some
time during the coming spring. Re-
plies are being awaited before further
action will be taken toward laying
{plans for this affair.

The remainder of the meeting was
devoted to a discussion of the pro-
posed Druid Index, a pamphlet soon.

Cooperative Association Saves
$7,000 To Campus Groups

 

Among other things feeding every-
one from basketball players to the
Pitt Panther cub, which was under

its care, has been the work of the Co-
operative Buying association for the
first twelve months since its organi-
zation, according to Samuel Strauss,
L35. director. The volume of business
transacted during this time amounts
to $35,401.29 with a net saving of $3,-
002.69, this saving being measured in
terms of the wholesale price. The
actual saving equals about $7,000.
At present 23 campus organiza-
tions are affiliated with the associa-
tion, including social and professional
fraternities and sororities, Items, the
purchase of which are based on com-
petitive wholesale market prices,
range from the buying of bread to

about $246.87, all bills have been paid
in full on the tenth of each month.

The expense of the association has
been the smallest expense of any
similar organization in the country.
Theodore Biddle, administration su-

Valentine

In Which Valentine Trends}
For ’34 Are Considered l
And Commented On

 

 

By Helen Rose Gibson

he papier mache cupids are be!
ing overhauled and candy stores are
dumping pastel bonbons in red satin‘
heart boxes, all of which suggests that
St. Valentine’s day is just around
the corner and it's about time to
look over the 1934 valentine situa-
tion. 'l‘o do the day up right, you had
better see that Grandpa and Aunt.
Tillie, as well as the boy or girl
friend, get a card. And before you
send your next letter home for
money, it would be a diplomatic;
move to post one of those lavender
sprigged valentines to Dad:

“Here’s hoping you have

wonderful day,

And I’m very sure you will.

Say, you’re a Dad I wouldn’t

exchange

For a million-dollar bill.”

The new note in cards is simplicity
and coyness. Frills, laces, and crys-
tal hearts are in. Lavendar, pink
and light blue have been substituted
for the blatant red of former years.
Highly colored valentines with ref-
erences to ice-men, salesmen, and,
saxaphone players are as outmodedll
as last. year's hat.

If you're the kind of girl that’s out,
to get your man in the modern way,,
there's plenty of cards that come}
right to the point. “It’s a crime how?
much I love you.” “I’m not in the:
real estate business, but do I know at
lot,” are among the more modest sen-l
timents. ‘However, we advise steer-
ing clear of the card with the scrib-[
bled “Always a bridesmaid, but never
a bride. Can’t you take the hint?”
Ditto for the verse, “Hey! Who'll vol-l
unteer to rescue me from the Old’
Maid’s Home.” After all . . . A

Of course there are the usual val-l
entines beloved by the wittier broth-I
ers. For instance, a tough mug with
a sandpaper neck and the remark,
“I may be a rough neck, but I’m|
pretty smooth,” or “Press your suit?
Tm willing” scribbled on an ironing
board.

If you’re just a little girl trying to
get along, we suggest a demur silver
heart entwined with black leaves
and the verse:

‘‘I don't know how to say it, clev-

erly, or cutely.

But I think you are a winner, and

I like you absolutely.”

But our vote for the Valentine of
l’.'t‘.-e Year goes to the little number,
“Tile Reason You're My l3oyt'riend,”

“There are boyfriends and boy-

friends,

llllit none are like you.

l ri'~:ally like you an awful lot,

I mean I actually do.”

And of course it comes wrapped in
cellopliaiie.

it IS best to refrain from sending
any of this type to your girl friends.
‘Years ago, when one's Valentine

it was altogether ﬁtting and proper
to send cards of the lace variety to
the girls. Beautiful verses and bril-

in those days, but when the girls be-

was just impossible for them to get

Nevertheless, there does come a
time when the need of textbooks, lab

a free gift suggestion, we are pass-

verse should accompany the card}
its just barely possible that some-

Plastered Walls Here
Not Due To Repeal
Of Prohibition

Plastering on the Cathedral
walls has begun, If you’re lazy
and never use the stairs, you
haven't seen it yet. Braving the
dangers of paint, plaster, and de-
bris, this explorer tramped to the
Fsteenth ﬂoor to ﬁnd E. F. Ostrum,
the plaster foreman. There she
found several men busy smooth-
ing white plaster on what has
heretofore been rough block,
brick and mortar.

The walls of the front stairway
have been plastered from the
fourth to the 15th ﬂoor. The
workers expect to keep going to
the 34th. Then they’ll start on
another stairway. These walls
may represent only a small per-
centage of the total square foot-
age in the building, but it does
warm a loyal Pittite’s heart to see
those smooth white walls. They
give a slight indication of just
how the Cathedral’s interior is go-
ing to look when completed.

Tuesday morning, February 6, Mr.

gift of $77.81 from the Chinese Stu-
dents’ club of Pittsburgh, to be used
for the purchase of two chairs for the

The interest of Chinese students of

used for furniture for the Chinese
room.

custom of paying all debts at the open-

much as it can of the loan advanced

Second Annual Indoor Track And Field Games Scheduled For Saturday *

Olson Throws Meet Open To All Pitt Students; '

Many Record-Breaking Performances Expected

Track House To Be Site;
Coeds Are Invited

Once again Coach Carl Olson is
serving the large group of novice ath-
letes. This time it is the second an-
nual indoor track and ﬁeld champion-
ships, another of Olson’s earnest ef-
forts to make the Pitt students track-
conscious. The championships will
be run off Saturday night at the Pitt

Track house.

Both varsity and freshman events
will be included in the capacity pro-
gram of 25 track and ﬁeld activities.
Thirteen of these will be scheduled as
varsity events while the freshmen will
compete in 12. With the omission of
the two-mile run, the freshman events
will parallel those of the upper-class-
men except that the freshies will
heave a 12-pound shot instead of the
16-pound iron ball. The attached
entry blank lists the complete sum-
mary of events.

Olson said yesterday in a statement
to the News, “I am expecting a great
turnout for this meet and I’m also ex-
pecting some great work from the par-
ticipants. I would not be a bit sur-
prised to see every one of our present
Track house records broken, in both
the varsity and freshman. events.
There is every reason to believe that
these championships will be a_gI‘eat
step in advancing the popularlty Of
track here at Pitt.” _

By way of review, it might be in-
teresting to note the success of
Olson’s two track and ﬁeld carnivals
staged since September. The annual
fall track and ﬁeld games attracted
more than 100 athletes, cl_11eﬂY
novices, and the ﬁnal summary l0_1111d
no less than 26 men awarded prizes
as place-winners. The recent AMA
meet which Olson brought to the Pitt
campus drew almost as great 3- tum‘
out as did the outdoor affair, although
the entries were not limited to P}tt
men, The hard-working coach s third
venture Saturday night is expected 130
eclipse these meets in the matter of
the novice turnout and in the Sklll Of
performance.

Two records which seem almost cer-
tain to fall are in the pole vault and
the shot-put. Cy Pelucha_cra.cked the
former mark unofficially 111 the AMA
meet while Pete Avizienis broke the
record for putt1ng_ the Shot? A Com’
plete list of the Pitt track house rec-
ords which will be subject to the as-
sault Saturday will be Dllbllshed in
the Friday's issue of the News.

All equipment will be furnished for
the entrants, according t0 0lS0l1- The
only requirement is the ﬁlled entry
blank. Every fully-registered student
at the University is eligible and in-
vited to compete. Spectators are like-
wise invited. Olson stresses the In-
vitation to the coeds who, for some
reason or other, are of the opinion
that they can not attend meets at the
Track house. The AMA meet. 110W‘
ever, found a good percentage of
women in attendance,

Pitt Stars Win
At Morgantown

   

 

Bonavita. Sets New Field House
Record In Weight Event

Pitt's up—and-coming indoor track-
men stole a good bit of the show at
the sixth annual West Virginia lTld0°1'
games at Morgantown Saturday night.
The Panthers amassed a total of 26
points to go into an unofficial tie with
Michigan State’s strong team for ﬁrst
place. No official team standings are
recorded in this meet,

Heading the list of individual Stars
for the Olsonnien was the husky
Bonavita who tossed the 35-pound
weight a distance of 50 feet, 3%
inches to break the existing West V11"
ginia ﬁeld house record. Cy Pelucha
captured another ﬁrst place for the
Panthers in the pole vault event, go-
ing 12 feet, 3 inches. Howdy O’Dell
was third in the vault. The relay
team of Kiger, McMunn, Connelly, and
Keller won the four-ﬁfths mile relay
race in the fast time of 2 minutes.
40 4/10 seconds_ Pitt also got a sec-
ond in the medley relay.

Bonavita also won second place in
the 16-pound shot put event. Walter
Good was second to Hickey, of Villa-
nova. in the broad jump and Atkinson
completed the Panther scoring by ﬁn-
ishing in a ﬁve-way tie for second
place in the high jump event.

For the Pitt freshmen, Lasky copped
the 70-yard low-hiirdles in 8.9 seconds.
Jacobson gave he little Panthers
more points by running third to the
sensational Jesse Owens, of Ohio
State, as the colored ﬂyer equaled the
world record of 6.8 in the 60-metres
dash. The comliination of Lasky,
Gerrety, Shafer, and Daff won ﬁrst
place in the sprint relay with a time
of 1 minute, 19 2/10 seconds.

Panthers Chalk Up Sixth Win In
Row As Seconds Star

Walloping an Army outﬁt that just
didn’t seem able to get out of the
trenches, Pitt’s Golden Panthers
scored their sixth straight cage vic-
tory at the Stadium Saturday night.
When the adding machines stopped
clicking Dr, Carlson’s boys had 64
points to their credit and the Army
had 18.

After the Pitt regulars had jumped
away to a 28-4 lead in the ﬁrst 15
minutes of the game, Carlson sent in
the second stringers. These boys ap-
peared to put on more steam than did
the varsity and as a result the score
read 39-6 at half-time.

With the second and third teams

playing all of the second half, it was
merely a matter of scoring, in which
efforts Ted Roderick led the pro-
cession. The ﬂashy sophomore netted
six ﬁeld glials and two fouls for a 14-
point total. Cribbs and Skip Hughes
each accounted for 10 points during
the 15 minutes of ball they played.
Dewalt, of the Army, was the best
point-getter for the visitors with a
grand total of ﬁve,

Wrestlers Need
175 Pound Man

If the wrestling team could only
ﬁnd a man weighing 175 pounds to
wrestle in that weight division it
could turn out a well-balanced team,
which would probably be capable of
winning their next two matches, one
with West Virginia, February 17, and
the other with Waynesburg, scheduled
for March 3.

Aside from the 175-pound division
vacancy, which will automatically
give the opponent a victory on a for-
feit, the Panthers have an exception-
ally strong team.

Four of the Panther wrestlers, Nor-
man Evans, Paul Hinchberger, Brad-
ford Ilsley, and Arthur Detzel, hold
Allegheny Mountain association cham-
pionship titles in the 115, 125, 135, and
heavyweight divisions respectively.
Barr, 145 pounder, after gaining a
little more experience, will ﬁll this di-
vision well enough. Willets, 155-pound
wrestler, and Cox, 165 pounds, round
out the team. Both men have had

having competed in several AMA
matches.

season by soundly trouncing Delaware
university Friday night in Trees pool
45 to 14. Pitt swimmers won six of
the seven ﬁrst places, Delaware win-
ning one. Hernian Adlersberg, swim-
ming the 200-yard breaststroke for

the meet with the Panthers by one-
ﬁfth of a second,

Bill Croes won the 150-yard back-
stroke giving Delaware their only ﬁrst
place by beating out Joe Jones and
William Swazuk. Russell Lindberg,

unable to compete due to acute Sinus
trouble.

Paul Stinner and Joseph Madden
gave Coach Corr’s team a ﬁrst and
second in the 40-yard freestyle. Jack
Denny and Charles “Steamboat”
Chambers did the same thing in the
100—yard freestyle and Adlersberg and
Joseph Schmeiler ﬁnished ﬁrst and
second in the breaststroke race.

John Carik came through with a

ing Harry Wilson, Delaware ace who
was awarded second place, Schmeiler,
who is not quite as good a diver as
he is breaststroker, took third place,
defeating Rohl. ,

The 440, won by Jack Hanna, and!
the 200-yard relay race won by Cham-
bers, Adlersberg, Ruhe, and Stinner

Panther Boxers
Lose To Dukes

Team Forfeits In Two
Weight Divisions

Pitt

Two forfeits by the Pitt boxing
team, a disputed decision, and the re-
mainder of the Panthers giving away
tremendous weight advantages en-
abled the Duquesine boxers to down
Coach Orsini’s team 4 to 3.

After Pitt forfeited in the 115 and
125-pound classes, the Dukes only had
to win two of the other ﬁve bouts to
cinch their victory. Jimmy Giannatti
gave the Duke captain, Fred Moore, a
ten-pound weight advantage, Giannatti
weighing 135 and Moore 145.
natti out-boxed his foe throughout the
three rounds, besides knocking Moore
half way across the ring in the second
round, but the oﬂicials awarded the
Duke boxer the decision.

Bernard Spiegel, boxing at 155
pounds gave Roseto of the Dukes a
ten-pound advantage. Giving his op-
ponents ten-pound handicaps is noth-
ing new to Speigel, for in his two
years of varsity competition he never
fought a man in his own weight divi-
sion. Roseto was declared the winner,

which gave Duquesne their 4-3 victory
over the Panthers.

Jack Schricker, Pitt captain and
conference 155-pound champ, moved}
up to the 175-pound class which gave:
Lucas of Duquesne a twenty-pound ad-
vantage. The size of his opponent did
not hinder Scliricker in the least, for
he won his bout on a technical knock-
out, the referee stopping the bout
in the second round. Joe Kopp was
the only Pitt boxer who stayed in his
class. He easily defeated Nee of Du-
quesne. The summary:

115-pound class-—Pitt forfeited to Ed Carr,
of Duquesne.

125-pound class-—-Pitt forfeited to John
Pfanersmith, of Duquesne.

135-pound class——Duquesne forfeited to Abe
Konick, of Pitt.

145-pound class—Freddie Moore, of Du-
quesne, defeated Jimmy Giannatti, of Pitt.

155-pound class—-Tony Roseto, of Duquesne,
defeated Bernard Spiegel, of Pitt.

165-pound c1ass—Joe Kopp, of Pitt, defeated
Ed Nee, of Duquesne.

175-pound class-—Jack Shricker, of Pitt, de-i
feated Paul Lucas, of Duquesne, by a tech-
nical knockout in the second round.

Exhibitions

125-pound class—Fred Ziegler, of Pitt, and
John Pfanersmith, of Duquesne, fought three
rounds with no decision rendered.

135—pound class—Abe Konick, of Pitt, and
Dan Parent, of Duquesne, fought three,
rounds with no decision rendered.

Heavyweight class—Arnold Green, of Pitt,
of Duquesne, fought
three rounds with no decision rendered.

Soldiers Saturday night was not their
greatest. In 1929 with the great
Charley Hyatt in the lineup Pitt won
over the Army 69 to 16, a 53-point mar-
gin, Pitt seems to be becoming an
Army jinx if there is such a thing.

Track And Swim

It is beginning to be noticed around
the University that in the present
swimming and track squads we are
represented by two of the best in Pitt
athletic history,

Coach Patrick J. Corr’s swimmers
have yet to meet defeat. Their great-
est victory was scored on February 2

at the Trees pool when they defeated
Ohio State’s highly touted squad, 42

victory in the relay, the ﬁnal event of
the evening’s program. Russel Lind-'
berg, swimming his ﬁrst year on the;
varsity, and Herman Adlersberg,§
senior veteran have turned in the;
most sensational performances thusi
far this year. Lindberg set.a newi
AMA 50-yard record in a meet Janu-I
ary 27 in the PAA pool when he cov-7
ered the distance in .24:2, Adlers-E
berg cracked the Trees pool recordl
for the 220-yard breast stroke whenl
he won the event against Delaware}
in 2:36:13. Jack Hanna is also among‘
the record-breakers, having crackedI
the Carnegie Tech pool record for the
440-yard free style. ,

Now for the track squad. Fromi
present indications Coach Carl Olsonv
