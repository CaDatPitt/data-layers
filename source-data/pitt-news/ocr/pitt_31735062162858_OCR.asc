Object To  

    DefenseAct

By NATHAN F1nEs'ro1siE
The American Assn. of Uni-

 

s versity Professor, (A.A.V.P.),

university chapter, prepared

' a resolutionat their meeting

of Feb. 12, objecting‘ to
clauses in the National De-
fense Education‘AJc_t of 1958 and
National Science Foundation Act
Of 1950. l ‘

’ The clauses in question provide
for ’a“ disclaimerpiaﬂidavit to be
signed ‘by the student“ requesting

’_ _the 1o'an._ The affidavit requires

“persons _who beneﬁt under these.
acts to- disclaim their belief in,_
membership in, and support of

, subversive o1j,ganizations.”

I The speciﬁc clauses are Section
1001 (f) Title X of the National
Defense Education Act, and Sec-
tion‘ 15(d) of the National Science
Foundation Act of 1950. ' '

‘ Identical "Clause V ._

Although ‘the ' clause ‘in the De-
fense Act has come to the atten-
tion of , the public in recent
months, it is not generally known
that thissame clause is" found in
the Science Foundation Act..

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, presi-
dent of__ the local A.A.U. chapter,
stated that universities that pro-
test the Defense Act, alsopro-'
test the other out of principle._
Continuing his explanation of

the.‘ Association’s viewpoint, Ro-
senberg said that there -were us-
uallythree arguments brought ou
against the clause. _ , . —
Cites Discrimination ,

The first is that it is discrimina‘-
tory. against students applying for.
these (loans, since those making
application ' for “agricultural or
small business aid are not forced
to sign these aﬂidavits.

The second argument was
that it simply was not effective.

'l;he third, and_ most important

:in'R'osenberg’s opinion, was that
it was a fundamental infringe-
ment upon ‘-a person's right‘ to
think. ~

Records Objection ._

The ' exact text of the resolu-

tion stated that “. . .'the Chapter

. . . does hereby ‘record its ob-
jection to these requirements and
. . . does. hereby commend the
University of: Pittsburgh for mak-
ing. known its objection to these
_ requirements.” A

Old Darlington

‘ A Library Holds

Valuable Books

Situated on the sixth floor of
the Cathedral, the Darlington
Room offers a trip back to the
19th century.

The room is designed in the
original Americania design as the
original library of William Mc-
Collough Darlington, a famous
19th century Pittsburgh real estate
lawyer.

Many of the bookcases which
shelve the valuable books and
manuscripts are pieces from the
original library. On the wall of
the main room sits a hand painted
clock also from his home. The col-
lection takes a total of nine rooms
to quarter.

This collection was donated to
the university by Darlington’s
daughters after his death in
1918.-They kept only a few pieces
and after the last daughters death

-2‘-- the university was given the re-

mainder of the collection.

g Until 1935, the collection rested
in State Hall still in crates. Not
until the room was designed and

~completed were the books remov-
ed from their crates. Then they
were set in the original bookcases
or special ones which were espec-
ially made to match the original
identically.

Among the valuable pieces in
the library are Dickens’ ﬁrst edi-
tions both in the bound and earl-
ier unbound editions. Also a com-
plete set of “Jesuit Relations” and
letters of the Jesuits in the orig-
inal French. The ﬁrst pocket book,

 Now Is the Time V
The new student government constitution provides for
three branches of government: executive, legislative,
"S judicial. These first two branches, which include the pres-
bident and vice president of the student body and the 30-
Smember. Senate, were elected last Wednesday. 4 V -
This leaves the judicial branch, the Supreme Court, to
‘be ﬁlled. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 -of the constitution
provides the method for appointing the judicial branch.»
. «“The Supreme Court shall be composed of seven stu-
.. dents who shall be appointed by the Student Affairs Com-
Wmittee with the consent of the Senate.’{ ’ A
, The Student Affairs Committee has its monthly session
fjtomorrow. It seems logical that the Court‘ will be appointed.
fat that time. However, ambiguous bodies such as the Stu-
. dent Affairs Committee always do not operate logically.
This appears to be one of those ‘illogical times.
Some oppdsition to appointing the Court appears to
have developed.'This opposition lies with some administra-
-tive members -of the committee rather than the student
participants. Just why any negative feeling toward the
Supreme Court has arisen is not clear.

‘ministrative staff members, this reason goes, have sud-
denly realiied that affairs over which they presently -have
~ jurisdiction may be transferred to the Court, taking away
from them (the staff members) much influence.

As we said, this is only speculative. Whether there is
any basis to this reason or not, it seems to be too trivial

making the appointments tomorrow.‘ ,
s ’ There are at least two good reason why the justices
‘ "should be named at this time. First, no matter whether the
‘committee desires to make the appointments or not, the
constitution'—which has been ratiﬁed by the student body——'-
I. has invested that power in the committee and no one else.
Second, if the committee doesn’t act tomorrow, it
rWon’t be able to -do for another month, until its next. meet-
ing. After waiting all that time plus the time it’ would take
’» the Senate to approve the appointments, the Court would
have less han one month in this trimester in which to be-
I gin functioning. I l
A » There is no reason why the Supreme Court, equally as
important as the other two branches of government, should
not be given as equal a beginning as the other branches.

‘How’ Does.'Your C-ar'de__n ‘Crow? .4. .-

Thircl and Most Important

By David Breakstone
In an attempt to more fully
understand the apolitical nature
of the college population in this
country we have briefly examin-
ed the prevailing -national scene
which shows a
rather similar 
lack of sustain- 7
ed concern on  _, A
anyone’s p art  
about anything. 
We‘ postulat-
ed two reasons
for the col- 3
legiate “I don”; ‘
give a damn” g
attitude: ﬁrst, a i
feeling of im-
potence in a
time of massive armament which
appears to be suicidal, and sec-
ond, a participation in the gen-
eral adoration of the golden
status quo. .

The third cause of the Culp-.
able non-involvement of the col- .-

lege student is the most signifi-
cant. .(For this particular case

I believe that the argument is’

generally applicable to the na-

tion,

however the particulars drawn

upon apply speciﬁcally to our

community.) Most importantly,
. the college student is the timid,

conservative being he is because

the universities like him, encour-

age him to be that way.

In a time of rapid expansion,

of man’s knowledge there is
little corresponding expansion
of the concept of what education
in a revolutionary'age should be.
The university would like to re-
tain its scholastic, traditional in-

tegrity by pulling its ivory shell‘

of immunity to the issues of to-
day _tight around it.

Between the Extremes
The university fails, I think, to
distinguish between ‘preserving

Bored With Boredom Talks . . 

The Accusableu Ame_ricans  

By Lorraine Lesoon
Last month, an article appear-
ed in Harpers magazine in which
the writer had the perspicacity
V to predictithe future end of a

steadily degenerating s o c i e t y.
The epitaph
would doubt-
less ' read “And
of
sophisti/c a t e_d
boredom.”

* The article
stipulated the
urgent need for
laughter in a
society that
produced such
wonderful non-
sense in the

Fifties? ,

“Never has a nation "been

more ripe, more begging
for mockery, for satire,
for wit.”

But no one laughed, and if
they don’t soon, Eric Goldman
has prophesided that

“American civilization could

end with us just sitting,
solemnly on our lawn
chaises, overfed,‘ over sanc-
tified and overbearing,
talking a suicidal stuffi-
ness.”

tion, Mr. Goldman cited some

articles from Screen Play maga- .

zine in which the stars ponder-

-ed the philosophical problems of —

the nature of man, of God, -and
man to his environment. Sum-
med up in Jane Russell’s words,

sphere and its responsibility to
mold students who can think

critically and make responsible

choices as citizens. -
By insisting on remaining
within highly structured curri-

cula and time-honored standards‘

of “academic excellence” the

university shelters, insulates the
student for four years and then
turns him loose into a dynamic
contradictory society.

These‘ time-honored standards
are static, usually undemanding
ones which‘compliment neither
teacher nor student. An -easily
accomplished performance has
come to be synonymous with a
satisfactory performance. What
has happened to the concept of
a stimulating challenge?

The class—goer has been ef-
fectively discouraged from

speaking his mind, expressing‘

his own opinions, and doubts,
acting like a normal, political
animal. His mind is geared‘ to-
ward working for grades, fulfill-
ing field requirements, swallow-
ing abstract, unintegrated facts
which glibly passfor knowledge.

whose responses have been ‘con-
ditioned to the ringing a boring
bell of “getting along with the
in-group.”

Certain dicta _, have become

' commonplace in this closed so-

ciety: Diversity is unnatural;
ideas are suspect — intellectual
standards are, not high: “swallow
the pablum like a good idiot” ——

/social standards are .high: “join

a group of good fellows who will
grow_ up and run the country.”
It would be myopic to blame

-only the institution and its out-

moded mores for this distressing
situation. By 19 or 20, a com-

 course, its funny, in fact, its
almost ludicrous. But how many '

people have time to read Screen

Play.

Constant Cliches ,
Before, since and after,‘ the

' words, ., sophisticated boredom

have become almost a cliche. At

' an increasingly alarming rate,

writers, ‘young and old, have
used them (or the general theme
the words imply) to air their
gripes. '/

Subtle poets and outspoken
journalists have accused the
typical‘ American of being. a
faithless savage, who displays
ethical and
moral apathy, and have, by
those generous writers of pos-

‘ terity,‘ been excused for giese

atrocities, ‘since the likely basis
for such behavior naturally
stems from two world 'wars and
a police action in Korea.

The Status Seekers by Vance
Packard brought to light the

terrible truth about the class-'

less classes. Unlike archeologists,
who try to build a truth about
man’s history, poll takers and
peeping toms made a better dis-
covery. '

The hidden barriers were un-
veiled and for months later one
had to be extremely careful
about whether he was going to
use the ‘ lavatory, washroom,
commode or toilet (Strange! He
never mentioned anything about

V the John). Toilet is the correct

word just in case anyone is con-
templating his resurrection into
the ranks of the upper—uppers.

Ironically, e no u g h, :

able to take some responsibility
for his own development, and

anyone’s disapproval. '

But, I ask, who knows an in-
dividual? Without question edu-
cation is a monologue, andra
pretty badly stereoty/ped one at
that. Education in its most vital

form is a dialogue between the

curious and the knowledgeable.
The conversion of the ancient
Academy has rarely been sur-
passed as a‘ teaching instrument.
But now, if .a student doesn’t
ask questions in college, where
he is so well-protected, what
can he possibly be expected to
do later when there is no father

The consequences of the stu-

university climate are danger‘-‘

clarity.in a‘ society that Clearly
lacks critical intelligence and
‘moral integrity.

least resistance is the road we,

-the college optimists, are hap-

pily sauntering along, pleased,
with theleifortlessness of it all.
A few discontents, like my‘

This time the truth is too obvi-

-We have been paradoxically
accused of ‘the “Uniquely Amer-

_ican behavior of believing in

oneself, on the. one hand and -of

being hypocracy and faithless
allegience (by writers too num-

‘ erable to mention) on the other.

Detachment, involvement. and
sophisticated boredom a-s_i=.de
from every word in_ the English
vocabulary have been modiﬁed
by these words “Uniquely Amer-

these instances has the accusor
adequately explained‘ his term-
inology. .

ing sophisticated but I am bored.

damn their society with worth-
less journalism, driving their

Sponsored Independently

HP.AF is actually a non—proﬁt
research corporation, sponsored,
supported, and controlled by its
sixteen member universities. The
headquarters of the organization
‘ is in New Haven, Connecticut. , ‘

Established in 1949, HRAF’s

purpose is to collect, organize,

and distribute information of

significance to the natural sci-A

ences and humanities, as well’
ras to the social sciences.

More broadly stated, the func-
tion of the organization in its
origin was to “facilitate research
in the sciences concerned with
mankind, thereby promoting a
general understanding of the peo-
ples of the world, their ways of
life, their problems, values, and
ideas.” '

Quantitative Research

a research tool are an attempt to

Developed Microﬁlm
Since only a limited number of
universities could avail themselves
of the original ﬁles, HRAF, in co-
operation with University Micro-
ﬁlms, developed a microﬁlm ver-

sion of the ﬁles. These microﬁles 

can be distributed on a larger
scale. ‘ ,

Not all ﬁle material is yet
available on ﬁlm,\but eventually
subscribing universities will re-
ceive all ﬁle information. Pres-

‘ently, only ﬁles which are up-
to-date and complete as pos-
sible are’ being ﬁlmed. Elinor
additions and corrections" will
be made’ in ‘the future without
charge. ’

lDue to the nature of the ’Area
_Films, regular roll-_micro—ﬁlm. is
not practical for micro reprpduc1-
tion. The system in use allows. the
userto selectionly the information
he’ wants, without the need of
running through many feet of ﬁlm
to get at"the information he is
seeking. A

A further advantage is that ad-
files already on
microﬁlm can be made‘ without
producing an entirely new set of
ﬁlm, and is easily protected
against damage.

Lehigh University, the number nine team in the coun-

try, will invade Panther—land

this coming Saturday as Rex

Peery’s Vmatmen look for their seventh win of the season.
The wrestling match will get under way at 8:15 p.m. at the

Field House.

The Panthers, who are r’anked‘number_ten, will have a‘

tough job on their hands trying toO-é—-~—— — —- 

dispose of Lehigh. Last year the
Engineers defeated the Panthers,
16-12, to hand the Peerymen their
only setback of the year.
Lehigh will have only one reg-
ular returning from last year’s
- squad. He is Captain Thad Turner
who is-undefeated this year. He
has won six and has battled to a

___I' draw in seven outings._ Turner
~J"‘wrestled in the 167-pound class

last year and held Torn Alberts,

This year Turner has moved up
to 177 pounds and will have to
face Len Vuocolo, the Panthers
most improved matman. 4
Lehigh’s Lineup

The rest of the Lehigh lineup
consist of mostly sophomores with
the "exception of Bob Gunst, "who
is a junior. Bob Dalling will
wrestle at 123 pounds, Doug Bail-

The Panthers'wil1 be. out to re-
venge last year’s loss.
15-11 Victory

Last Monday at East Lansing,
Mich., the Peerymen won their
sixthpf the year when they upset
previously unbeaten Michigan
State. The Panthers swept the

ﬁrst four weight classes (as usual).

and then picked up a win in the
177 _pound division to gain the
15-11 victory. ~
Vuocolo turned out to be the
hero for the ‘Cats. Going into
the last four weight classes the‘

Blue and Gold needed only, one
victory to win the match. One
victory was all they got.
Vuocolo battled Mike Senzig to
“a close 5-4 win. It was his ﬁfth
Victory in« seven starts. Panther
Mighty’ Mites, Dick Martin .and
Larry‘ Lauchle, won shut out vic-
tories from George Hobbes and
Bill Guzziardo-
Mighty Mites ‘Win
Martin defeated Hobbes‘ 7-0
while the best Lauchle could do
over Guzziardo was 5-0. Keeping
in pace with the Cats winning
ways, Daryl Kelvington decisioned
Norm’Young <10-5.

John Zolikoff, Panther .147
pounrfer, added the Cats fourth
victory -by downing Gordon’
Johnson 6-3. At this point the
Peerymen held a 12-0 ‘edge over
the Spartans and needed one
victory to clinch the meet.

It was a. long time in coming as
Bill Robb lost to Michigan’s Bob
Moser, 9-2 and August Arrigone

only one second remaining in‘the
match. .
Four Undefeated
-’ Then Vuocolo came through
with'his mu'ch needed victory.be-
fore Guzik lost to John Ba'um, 6-4.
At the end ‘of seven matches
the Panthers still have four_un-
defeated wrestlers. Mar tin,
Lauchle, Kelvington and Zoli-
koff. All have clean slates.’
Lauchle and Kelvington each
have seven victories while Zoli-
koﬁ has six wins and a draw.
Martin is 5-0. .

Gymnasts Wonder Who Has

' - _ By-LARRY
Last 1 Saturday
‘turned out to. be the charm

HAGGERTY A

"against Temple the third-timeaactually 1

for the Panther gymnasts-as

they snapped a two-meet loosing streak that had been af-

that order.

12- ﬂicted by the two service academies,.Navy and Army, in

?But the" Jungle _Cat,’s coach, Warren Neiger, is hoping

‘that ‘this mythical omen will noté.

come back to haunt him when his
gymnasts entertain Georgia Tech
at the Field House this Friday
evening. The meet gets underway
at 8 o’clock.

This is only the third meeting
in gym history between the Cats
and the Engineers. Both previous

contests have found the Blue and.

Gold coming out on the long end
of the score in each instance. So
-naturally the charm favors the
visitors in this aspect.
Neiger will also have the charm
working against his Panthers since
.he will be out to bite the hand
that once fed him for the third
consecutive time.. Thus it seems
that the charm ‘will be favoring
Tech again. even though the
Panthers are slight favorites.
Following his graduation from

M Penn State in 1947, Neiger ac-

cepted an offer to become physical
education instructor and assistant
coach "in gymnastics at _Georgia

Dixie school at the time, ‘and the
man who will be tutoring the
Rambling Wreck on Friday‘ night,
was and is Lyle Welser.

Coach Neiger held these posi-
tions until 1952 when he was
beckoned by the then Panther
Athletic Director, Captain Tom
Hamilton, to teach physical edu-
cation and put gymnastics on a
successful basis in Pittsburgh. He
has ﬁlled the dual capacities ever
since and has developed successful
gym teams in addition to turning
out collegiate, champs in Tom
Darling and Jiml Mulvihill.

The contest with Georgia Tech
will ma_rk the Panthers’ last home
meet. of the 1960 campaign. A con-
test with always powerful Penn
State concludes theiregular season
schedule at University Park on
February 27. The" Panthers’ record
to date is 4-2. 2

 New Trail For
 City Basketball

 

By TED COLTON

Frank Carver, Pitt’s athletic director, has made the ﬁrst
move to promote big time basketball in the city of Pitts-

diburgh. Last week Carver announced, along with Mel Crats-

‘ley, Carnegie Tech AD, and Lou Skender, Duquesne AD, the
«scheduling of doubeheaders for the 1960-61 basketball season
with the Dukes, Tartans and the Panthers sharing the pro-

Although the Redskins don’t

they do have a scoring potential
that is equal to the Panthers.

basketball team is a mystery. As an example take the abilit
of our district high schools to ﬁll their gyms with ardent s'up-
porters every time they play; and when the WPIAL holds its
playoffs in the Field House a cheering throng is always on
hand to witness this event. a

 

  

 Something has to be ‘ done to alleviate the dismal
state of college basketball in Pittsburgh, and Carver has
taken the ﬁrst giant step. The twin bills shouldattract
more fans to the. Field House to see two games for the
price of one. Here each fan, no matter his loyalties; will
get an opportunity to cheer his favorite team, whether it
be Duquesne, Tech or Pitt. 0

. However, this ﬁrst move will not be sufficient ‘enough
to bolster attendance to what it should be in a sports town-
” like Pittsburgh,

N o matter how many games are to" be played at the“Field

I e W -House, Gus Fan is not going to keep climbing the steep hill

= dust. Everytime there is a crowd at the Field House, one can

: /hardly see across the court by halftime, because of the dust

that is kicked up from the dirt track which surrounds the
playing area.

 

This may be all right for someone in the cleaning
business but the average fan doesn’t want to spend a
couple of dollars to get his clothes cleaned every time
he comes to a ‘basketball game. There must be a way to
get rid of the dirt track and still have the track team
practice. In the Navy Field House at Annapolis there is
a new dirtless-composition track. Whatever- the answer,
it will be the duty of the higher-ups to solve.

 

e The next problem is the biggest and hardest to answer.
if; 4 ' -How can Pittsburgh get a winning basketball-team’? At the
 ' present_ time, Carnegie Tech is the only team in the city that
sports a winning record. And« no matter how clean and mod-
ern the Field House is, the fans will not come to see a los-
ing‘ ball club. ‘

Now to solve this. One proposal is the bringing of Dudey
Moore back to the city. He can surely build the sorely needed
winner.._A revamped recruiting program thatbrings the top-
notch district stars to the local colleges is also a must. '

 

About the only thing I can sayiis, good luck Mr. Carver;
’ you are starting in the right direction’ and let’s _hope you
succeed in bringing big time basketball to Pittsburgh.

Notre Dame To
Test Thinclads

Coach Carl Rees’ trackmen,

now owners of a 0-2 record»

will again be seeking their
ﬁrst victory of the season this
Friday against Notre Dame.

The Panthers will have a
tough job beating the Irish, who
alreadyuhave two wins under their
belt. The ﬁrst was over Missouri,
53-50; ‘and the second over Pur_-
due, 87-17.

Coach Rees said, “The team

should make a _better showing‘. e_
against Notre _Dame than they._d.~idi-.. 

against Army and Navy, providing"
the team performs as they are
capable of performing.”

He continued, -“The reason for
the team’s poor performance so
far this season. is mainly because

"they have not performed as they

should have.” ’

The Panthers should be on bet- ‘
ter footing against the Irish, since
both teams lack sulﬁcient depth.

The Irish,_ however, are reported.-.2

to have a good‘ man in every-
event. .

One of their outstanding stars
is Ron Gregory, who is the man
to watch in either the mile, halt
mile "or two mile "run. He should
prove to be quite a .test for Ron,
Rush, who will_ probably start
against him for the Panthers.

By CHUCK DUNBAR. . I

Optimistic "is the word that
describes Coach Ben Grady’s
attitude about the forthcom-

Saturday. It may seem

conquered only one team, Lehigh,
in eight encounters this season.

However, it was this same Le-
high group that ~swan.1ped the
Orangemen, 65-30; and this same
Lehigh group lost to the Panthers,
52-43. Yet, it should be an excit-
ing contest, because Syracuse will

and both need wins to add respect
to dismal seasons.
