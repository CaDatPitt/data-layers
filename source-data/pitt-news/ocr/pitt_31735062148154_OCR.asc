.li’lagazine’s October
Edition Lists Policies,
Activities of Graduates

In the October issue ‘of the Alumni
Review, ofﬁcial organ of the Univer-
sity Alumni Association, the ques-
tion, “Why 'doesn’t the Alumni As-
sociation do something about athletic,
academic, and press problems of the
University?” is answered in a feature
article. ,

Distributed to 27,000 ‘alumni today,
the Review outlines Alumni Associa-
tion policies and accomplishments as
follows: (1) ultimate good of the
University, both as to size and repu-
tation, is the ultimate aim;

'(2) the Association will thorough-
ly represent the sentiments of the
alumni;

(3) “the Association has no de-
sire to dictateror interfere with Uni-
versity administrative policies, but it
cannot and will not stand idly by
when the good name of the Univer-
sity is at stake;”

(4) the Association, through an
investigating committee, has sug-
gested recommendations to correct
bad conditions, accepting the princi-
ple that' the University “is bigger
than any one or more individuals
within it.” .

The Review reports that the alum-
ni council, coincidentally with the
Board of Trustees, passed a resolu-
tion that a trustee investigation of
the University should occur; this
trustee committee has subsequently
functioned and made a report to the
entire Board, which has been made
public. The result of the trustee
ﬁndings correspond to those of the
alumni investigating committee.

In addition to the pertinent mem-
bership drive, the Association’s ans-
wer to the question presented in the
first paragraph is this: “The members
of the Association. can in the spring
of 1940 nominate to the Board of
Trustees thirteen alumni members of
that Board, men of prominence in
the community, men deeply interest-
ed in the University, and men of
courage, '- conviction, and independ-
ence. This does not mean that many
of the present members of the Board
whose terms will then expire do not
meet these qualifications.”

BULLETIN: Latest report on the
injuries of John Hobbs, C42, ac-
cording to Shadyside hospital
i authorities, is that his condition is
“very favorable.”

Although Hobbs suffered a
broken back, having fractured sev-
I eral vertebrae, his spinal cord was

not injured. He was placed in a
cast yesterday.

VVorld \Var 111, with all its hor-
ror of midnight blitzkrieg, mass
attacks, ﬂankiiig movements, seri-
ous casualties and counter-attacks,
broke over the University campus
immediately following the Du-
quesne victory last Saturday.

The result was damage to proper-
ty. and major injuries to many stu-
dents including John Hobbs, C42, in
Shadyside hospital with a broken
back.

Following the old college custom
of mass invasion, Duquesne forces
proceeded to the Stadium Saturday
evening to wrest a single set of their
“hard-won” goal posts from the
ground, but were astonished to ﬁnd
that the welcome sign was out and
the goalposts were ready for removal.

m.ents were made by the University
and Duquesne to have the spoils paid
for. The athletic department official-
ly stated, in communique No. 1, that,
“We let them have it to avoid trou-
ble.” ‘

the road to war is traced as reflected
in The Pitt Weekly of 1914-18, the
forerunner of The News. The present
series attempts to present student
attitudes as they existed during the
period that led to the first World
War.
By Dorothy Cleland

In the fall of 1915, a deﬁnite atti-

tude toward the war on the part of

the students was slowly crystalizing. ;by Thomas W. Green, vice president’

Gradually the opinion was evolving
that the war could no longer be ig-
nored, that, unlike the comparatively
minor skirmishes which had previ-
ously occupied Europe on and off for
centuries, it was getting to be more
than a local conﬁict.

At the annual assembly for fresh-
men in September Chancellor Mc-

Cormick, urging the students who‘

were eligible-to take advantageof
their right to vote, said: “The sig-
niﬁcance of all this is that in the
world crisis which is upon us, Amer-
icans must take the place of leader-
ship in right thinking and altruistic
endeavor, and that the youth of

America must be made ready for the ‘

high responsibility which they must
necessarily assume.” A

Perhaps as a spur to student vot-
ing in affairs of government, all stu-
dents, regardless of sex, race, minor-
ity, color, or previous condition of
servitude, were to be permitted to

Dr. W7illiams Will Speak

To Eiigineering Forum

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology, will speak at the ﬁfth En-
gineering anl Mines forum tomorrow
at 12:40 o’clock when he presents the
answer to the “American Youth’s
Quest for New Frontiers to Conquer.”

Each Thursday under the auspices
of the YMCA, engineering and min-
ing students meet in 801 Cathedral to
hear prominent speakers who are
authorities in the ﬁeld of engineer-
ing, metallurgy, and mining, Dick
Westermann, E40, chairman of the
forum committee, explains. Students
who attend are permitted to bring

‘ivote in the campus elections of that
5 year. This was apparently an inno-
{vation in academic circles as well as
,in local, state and national circles.

Q The editors continued their policy
I of headlining football news, but there
jwas beginning to appear a serious
Enote on the war which showed con-
gcern at least on the part of some (of
ithe students. An address to the stu-
E dents ‘graduating from summer school

sol‘ the American Peace society, on
E“War as a Moral Issue” seemed to
[have goaded the editors to some com-
§ment on the situation.
limiters Hopeful
Q They “announced a series of editor-
ﬁials dealing with the war.
Just as the Chan-cellor had done in
;his speech to the freshmen, the edi-
tors expressed the hope that the
United States would remain a refuge
for oppressed peoples’ and that she
would preserve civilization for a
world which would be nearly de-
stroyed by the war. In the ﬁrst ar-
lticle titled “The Thinking Minority,”
?they said that it was a myth that the
United States was the “Glorious
colossus we had thought from our
babyhood” and that the United States
“faces the most desperate challenge
and the highest mission that he ever
been set before the race of men.”
They favored a war that would repel
an invasion of one’s native land. ’
With twelve nations already at
war and the probability of more en-
tering at any moment, the students
accepted the war but were not re-
signed to it. Finally awakened to
nearly the full import of the war,
they were critically analytical of its
outcome. It was almost as if for
..a while they had been so stunned by
the actuality of war that they were
insensitive to what was happening.
Editorial Quiz ,
An editorial on November 3 said
in part, “In the midst of life we are
in war. Before it happened we did
not believe it possible . . . Will this
be the last great war‘? ‘Can we be-

economic or social or religious in-
hibitions? Will ’The Hague

subsequently taken and hidden by

further interschool clashes.

For the third time within a week
the students of the University of
Pittsburgh and Duquesne Univer-
sity will clash. This time, the bat-
tle will be verbal.

Students from both universities
will battle on the radio on the
program, Greater Pittsburgh
Speaks, which begins tomorrow
evening at 9«:o’clock over KDKA.

Representing the University of
Pittsburgh will be David Tucker,
C41, who received the Druid
award for being the most outstand-
ing sophomore, William Smith, E41,
who received the Sigma Tau award
as the highest ranking freshman;
and Thomas Halloran, BA40, chair-
man of the demonstration block.

“The money isn’t the important
thing,” Ray L. Coss, superintendent
{of buildings and grounds stated. “lt’s
lthe length of time until things will
look right again.”

Serious injuries to several students,
gbesides Hobbs, who, doctors at the
hospital stated, was doing as well as
could be expected.

Hobbs, it was reported, was pur-
suing the Duquesne parade in order
to recover his military hat which had
been takenin the morning scuffles.

S. S. Kalwary, C40, and ’I‘om Mur-
phy, BA42, received eye injuries in’
;the 11 o’clock “riot” and another stu-
ldent, whose identity The Pitt News
‘could not ascertain, experienced a
broken nose in the goalpost counter
attack at the “bluff on the bluff.”

Oﬁicial sources at the University
considered it best to ignore the War
Ill. It was generally agreed that the
Duquesne students were orderly in
their celebration until the counter at-
,tack in the form of buckets of water
iwas begun.

“We have,” one spokesman declar-
ed, “done similar things in the past.

!We should learn from this ‘demon-‘

lstration’ that it is not necessary to

be rufﬁans. We should think, our-
selves, how the others might feel
when we invade their campuses.”

One of the most comprehensiige
surveys of college football subsidize-
‘tion ever to be published and one
certain to interest University stu-
dents is “Test Case at Pitt” by Fran-
cis Wallace, appearing today in The
Saturday Evening Post.

In the ﬁrst of the two articles on
the situation at the University, Wal-
lace says, “The Pitt story is worth
{telling in detail because drama sim-
Qilar to it, in all of its complexity,
have been enacted behind closed
doors at dozens of universities
throughout the country”

! Complete Picture

Wallace, by talking to all the prin-
cipals involved in dispute leading to
the resignation of Dr. John Bain
Sutherland as football coach last
winter, has been able to present the
most complete picture of the contro-
versy yet to appear.

Tracing the problem back to its
roots in the years just prior to 1920,
Wallace points out that “In 1919 Pitt
was a national football power, but
the school had not kept pace.aca-
demically.”

to Pitt in 1921 as chancellor, he at-
tempted to remedy this. Wallace

, Admission for members will be 25
icents with assessment for non-mem-
ibers set at 35 cents.

: Refreshments will be served and a
trecording machine will furnish mu-
isic for dancing.

The general committee includes
Fred Duffy, C40; Bo-b Johnson, BA40;
Ruth Dumm, Ed42; Jack Snyder,
BA40; and Theodora Kearns, C40.

l Art Discussions Begin

First of a series of talks on con-
temporary art, planned by the ﬁne
arts department, will be held this
evening at 8:30 o’clock in the Fine
Arts Library.

The talk is being given by Walter
Read Hovey, professor of ﬁne arts.
He will speak on “Visual Expression
and Modern Taste.”

These series will be unique in that
they will present not only the views
on artists and their work, but also
the views of their public and patrons.

Football Subsidization in Article

says, ‘The new chancellor wanted a
cathedral. Well, football wanted a
stadium . . . one that was envision-
ed as paying for itself and bringing
big profits.”

Cathedral, Stadium Clash

Wallace continues, “While each
was still but the shadow of an idea,
the cathedral and the stadium clash-
ed . . . in the ﬁrst test, the esthete
gave way to the athlete, the cathe-
dral bowed to the stadium.”

The ﬁrst greatiblow-up in the ath-
letic situation, Wallace recounts, did
not take place until after the Uni-
I versity had received considerable un-
ifavorable publicity from the inves-
!tigation and eventual blacklisting by
ithe American Association of Univer-
?sity Professors.

E The blow-up, the break between
ESutherland and director of athletics
lDon Harrison, came “in the inappro-
Ipriate setting of a victorious Rose
§Bowl celebration at Pasadena.”

1 In discussing the causes of the

‘break, Wallace describes the athletic

spolicy of the school aas representa-

ftive of a condition also found else-

}where.
Hagan Got Players

“To play money games it was nec-
essary to get Grade A material. Pitt
went out and got them . . . During
the eight years he was Harrison’s as-
sistant, Jimmy Hagan commanded
the go-and-get-’em brigade. He cov-
ered the football front like a hungry
traveling salesman and he had some-
thing to sell.”

Wallace presents a complete record
of the amounts paid players at the
University between 1924 and 1936
and comments on the difficulties
arising from the subsidization, in-
cluding the objections of rival. schools
to the “married men’s team.”

He brings the proble up-to—date
by including the Hagan Plan, the
Code Bowman, and the ﬁght for the
“liberalization” of the latter.

Pitt and Duquesne
End Their Series

Far from resulting in good—natured ribbing, the in-
vasion of the Pitt campus by victory—d<31iI‘i0uS Duquesne
students last Monday morning ended only in bitterness,
if the minor riots on the Cathedral lawn and in the
Commons room are to be taken as an expression of stu-
dent feeling.

Thus again, the undesirability of the Pitt-Duquesne
rivalry was demonstrated. Athletic competition, theo-
retically, should build good will between the competing
schools. If ‘this. test is applied to the Pitt-Duquesne
series, in at least two sports, the rivalry is not justiﬁed.

With almost every meeting of the two schools’ athle-
tic teams, the score has been a minor consideration;
name—calling and bad blood have held the center of
attention. The games, in the case of football and of
hockey, have been the dirtiest engaged in by both teams
all season.

The Pittsburgh Press, in an editorial Sunday, de-
plored the closing of the Pitt-Duquesne football series,
put it up to Pitt to continue the series, and insisted that
it was the most popular series engaged in by any of the
three local college teams. May we ask, popular with
‘whom?

We can not speak for Duquesne, but we know that
Pitt teams do not want the series. Pitt students do not

school spirit whatsoever? After the
Duquesne game last Saturday I was
‘disgusted with the ‘reactions of some
of the Pitt rooters. One girl, appar-

she wasn’t going to attend the com-
ing Pitt games.

our team she was enthusiastically}
shouting for Pitt, but as soon as Du-

We Lost;
We Won!

By Kai Kalwary .

Duquesne. university's student body.
ﬁnally had something to hurrah about
last week-end. Their men of foot-
ball had thoroughly humbled a high-
ly favored Pitt eleven, 21 to 13.

Monday morning, as was antici-
pated, the great, silent blanket of
gloom over the Cathedral was punc-
tured by a rowdy army of some 500
holiday bent Bluifmen.

Not satisﬁed with circling the Pitt
campus—b1asting trumpets, waving
banners, sounding automobile horns,
shouting un-Shakespearean cheers—
they further aggravated the situation
when they swarmed into the Com-
mons Room and some class rooms.

Duke passes were superior Sat-
,urday. Pitt passes were superior
Monday. From this highly preju-
diced corner (I landed in one)
more Pitt fists hit the mark than
those from the “Cobble Campus.”

Cap and Gowner Herb Hochstet-
ter and varsity gridder Tom Mur-
phy carried the major part of the
Panther oﬂensive. Several Blue
and Gold rooters, probably under
the impression that the Pittmen
would score easier and oftener on
a wet ground, trained three ﬁre
hoses on the Commons Room. It
took less than the allotted time for
two periods of scrimmage to rout
the thuggish invaders.

Strategists Bill Daufenbauch, Rob-
ert Corley, Dean Lanfear, Dr. J. K.
Miller and Raymond Coss were well
pleased (I hope) with the home boys’
sudden and effective charge. It was
a typical, concentrated Pitt power
drive.

The goal posts, captured by the
Dukes Sabbath evening, were re-
trieved by a brave, solemn band of
Panthers chased by the juvenile
celebrants from the hilltop campus.

State Hall, the hangout for en-
gineers, was decorated with these
same goal posts that belonged to Pitt
Saturday, Duquesne Sunday, and the
Pitt Engineers Monday.

Athletic officials here announced
—-several weeks ,before the Pitt-
Duquesne game—-the termination "
of the popular city series. It is
ﬁtting that we applaud the close of
football relations with a worthy
but undisciplined rival.

We lost Saturday, but we bal-
anced the” scales Monday!

FROM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAIl‘l
Sports Editor I

.stress by our football writer, Bertram I. Jaﬁe.

MR. FRANCIS WALLACE, who is one of the nation’s better
sports writers, has produced a restrained, thorough piece of journal-
ism in his “Test Case at Pitt,” the first chapter of which appears in
today’s Saturday Evening Post. He has also produced the fairest
treatment of the Pitt situation which we have seen.

VVritten primarily as an expose of high-pressure football at its
worst, the article succeeds in presenting the basic reason or reasons
for the break down of that high-pressure football at Pitt. Wallace
points out that Dr. Bowman was never satisﬁed with the athletic sit-
uation, but in his attempt to ﬁnance the building of his dream, the
Cathedral of Learning, he allowed the athletic department to remain
pretty much on its own.

Then when the ﬁnancing problem became less acute, gradual
changes were made in the makeup of the athletic department, and
from the time the ﬁrst, changes were made until Jock Sutherland’s
resignation last year, more and more “incidents” occurred.

Pitt Called “High School”

Eventually. there was a blow-up between Sutherland and di-
rector of athletics Don Harrison. I-Iarrison, appointed by 1’)r. Bow-
man, left the University, and, as in the case of the stadium being
built before the cathedral, “Again the academici-an had bowed to the
athlete.” ,

Naturally, with this continual eonﬂict between “brain and
brawn,” things were bound to come to a head. And with the
Hagan Plan and the Code Bowman, both att.empts at a reform of the
l.'nivei'sity's high-geared football program, the bubble of peace be-
tween Sutherland and the admi.uistra.t.ive offices broke.

_ Sutherland. who had become less and less important in the gen-
eral scheme since Jimniyﬂagan was given complete authority in
the athletic department, handed in his res.ignation. And for the ﬁrst
time the battle between “stadium and cathedral” had swung in the
favor of the cathedral. And, as VVallace points out, this is the con-
<;lition the chancel.lor and the administrative offices feel should exist.

To quote Vv'allace, “They assert athletics, after all, constitute
only a departntient of the university, and an accessory department. at
that . . . That  the one and only reason for the actions they took,
the ‘cl(iIIl’1llll.9‘;I.«I'.“?l.I,lO11 men contend. Jock Sutherland’s resignation came
because he could not entirely reconcile himself to the idea that the
acadeinic side comes ﬁrst.” ~

Peace Bubble Breaks

And to make a fact of this assumption, which has not yet been
completely accomplished, the administration has fought. against tre-
mendous odds in and out of the University. When Dr. Bowman came
to Pitt, \V'a.llace relates, “It (Pitt) was characterized . . . by Upton
‘Sinclair as ‘the only high school in the country giving a degree’.”
It was and continued to be until recently a “football school.” Dr.
_%Bowman hoped jT0<;* lift that stigma from it.

\VI1ether-he used the proper methods to lift that stigma is both
dehateable and debated. But‘ it is worth while to realize that he was
faced with a ticklish problem. In any controversy, both sides will
make 111i_stak.es.- Ye,t, to.our knowledge, Wallace’s account is the
‘first to Inafke acknowledgenient of that fact.’ 4

Tliere is far more in “Test Case at Pitt” than we have men-
tioned. \’\='e have chosen to mention some of the points not generally
recognized. But" we believe that the story is complete enough for
a.i1y(>11e to draw their own c'onclusious. C(msequently, we say, read
“Test Case at Pitt.”

Rams to Oppose"
Olsonmen Friday

In ew York City

By Ben Foote

Still rated as a crack cross coun-
try team despite the defeat by
Michigan State, ﬁve times national
collegiate champs in the last six
years, Pitt’s cross country squad
today invades historic West Point
for a joust with Uncle Sam’s ﬂeet-
footed proteges.

Coach Olson’s junior threesome,
Walt Sterner, Al Boulanger, and
Frank McCabe fought their hearts
out in attempting to upset the Spar-
tan harriers, who have not lost a dual
meeting to an ICAAAA member in.

This same trio will carry the great-
er part of the burden in today’s meet,
although sophomore Lew Manuwal
may have one of his better inconsist-
ent days.

If Manuwal performs up to his
capabilities, the Panthers should ex-
perience little trouble from the Army.
However, if Manuwal’s inexperience

sticks out as itidid against Michigan
State, Coach Carl Olson’s harriers
may have difﬂculty.

The exact measure of the Army’s
strength is not known, but the West
Pointers are never weak in any ath-
letic event; consequently, the Pittites
will know they are in a race. In
Army’s initial contest this year, it
defeated Fordham, 24-31‘.

Friday afternoon, the Blue and
Gold thinclads motor down to New
York to match strides with the Rams
at Van Cortlandt Park, scene of the
ICAAAA championships later in the
campaign.

Since little trouble is expected
from the Fordham forces. this meet
will serve more to familiarize captain
Sterner’s mates with the champion-
ship course than furnish much com-
petition.

In addition to Captain Sterner,
Boulanger, McCabe, and Manuwal,
Bob Graham and Warren Rosebor-
ough, sophomores and senior Anton
Scurcenski are making the trip.
Coach Olson and trainer Herman
Bearzi drove the two cars, accom-
panied by manager George McLaren.

xlrweome it

In this Kaywoodie pipe, called the Car-
lmretar Kaywoodie, a wonderfully sweet-
smokmg pipe has been improved by the
application of a neat little principle of
physics. "When you take a puff at one of
these Carburetor Kaywoodies, you auto-
matically draw air in through a tiny inlet
in the-bottom of the bowl. That incom-
ing air keeps the smoke cool, sweet and
serene, no rnattcr how belligcrcntly you
puff. In fact, the harder you puff, the
more air comes in. That’s why it's called
a Carburetor Kaywoodic. Everybody
knows that a Kaywooclie is the most so-
cially-conscious of pipcs~—gets itself ad-
mired evcrywhere. And the Kaywoodie
Flavor is famous. But don’t let us urge

Radi Seeks Members for New
University Volleyball Team

Volleyball is not a “sissy” sport. That is the mistake made by
many men’ at ‘the University of Pittsburgh according to Charles Radi,
coach- of volleyball» at Pitt.

At‘ ‘the University of Pittsburgh volleyball is played on a so-
called “fun basis.” When asked what type of players he would
like most to have out, Coach Radi answered:

“I would like to have fellows who,
although lacking in experience, play
the game because they like it and
not for a prize or reward they expect
at the end of the season.”

This year the volleyball squad ex-
pects to play several ﬁrst class teams.

Members of the squad were: Joe
and Frank Kristufek, Eph Werner,
George Veiniger, David Leese, Milton
Ripp, and Harry Anderson.

WITH THIS COUPON FIRST

Attempts will be made to schedule GAME FREE
games with several branches of the , O
Y. M. C. A., high schools, and possi- JERRY S  BILLIARD‘

bly even smaller colleges.

Last season Pitt was victorious in
its only contest, winning over the
Slippery Rock players.

Continued from page one

The wisest heads are compelled to ad-
mit the practically inevitable ‘fact:
War is, _her"e, and generation, and
centuries may not suffice to stamp it
out.”_ . V ,
UY1iV€1‘Si’CY students realized that
the war contagion was spreading, but

the Lusitania tragedy, that the 3,000

rope might not be adequate protec-
tion. A few scare stories were
spread which jarred only slightly the
feeling of security so dominant. The
November 10 editorial on the war
told of plans by one Frciherr Von
Edelsheim wherein Germany might
set a quarter of a million men on
American soil in twelve days for an
invasion. 2

As a partial answer to this. the ed-

ever in the present situation, provid-
ed we utilize in a judicious manner a
small portion of the enormous re-
sources at our disposal. There is
just as certainly a golden mean be-
tween the extremes of the militaristic
advocates and the peace-at-any-
price men . . . as there is a reason-
able middle course in every activity
of our national or individual life.”

On Embargo Act‘

Lifting the Embargo act is not the
real-issue in the present conﬂict, but
the expansion of our system of dem-
ocracy is the vital point at stake.

This is the opinion of Hugh Wing,
instructor in English, who expressed
his views at a forum given by the
Sphinx’ club, pledge group to the
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

By the lifting of the embargo, em-
ployment will not be increased in the
economic boom that would result
from the manufacture of war mater-
ials, as was twice publicly indicated
by Roosevelt, for economists tell us
that this boom has been gradually
