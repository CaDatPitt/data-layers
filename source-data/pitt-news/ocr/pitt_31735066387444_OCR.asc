Panel  
discusses
Bork’s pros
and cons

By Frances Sansig
and Jason Hillman
The Pitt News

A panel discussion was held
last night in the Teplitz Moot
Courtroom at Pitt's School of Law
to debate the appropriateness of
the nomination of Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court of the United
States.

Representing those opposed to
Bork were Leroy L. Hodge, a
member of the steering commit-
tee on the‘Western Pennsylvania
Alliance to Block Bork; Mike
Healey, a member of the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union, and
Candice Hoke, a professor and
scholar in jurisprudence.

. Those representing those who
approve of the nomination of

‘Robert Bork included Richard

Seeburger, a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Law; Clyde H. Slease, an attorney
with a private practice, and John

Arch,'also a private practicing at-

torney. .

The area of debate centered
mainly on the roles of the presi-
dent and senate "play in the selec-
tion and confirmation of a
Supreme Court justice. c

”|t’s obviously the duty of the
president to select [a member of
the Supreme Court] ” said

 Slease.

’’It has now erroneously been
suggested the senate can reject
the nomination for the Supreme
Court on ideological ground,” ac-
cording to Slease. _

Healey argued that there was
little dispute as to what the role
of the senate is, but that there is
”great dispute in the role of the
senate.”

CMU fraternities issued fire violation

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

The Pittsburgh Bureau -Fire
Department has expanded their
inspection program and recently
issued several verbal warnings to
Carnegie Mellon University
fraternities for fire violations in
their houses, according to Ron
Campana, greek advisor at CMU.

’”A fire inspector went in to
each fraternity house,” said Cam-
pana. ”Probably each house
recieved some verbal warning.
Most of all the fraternities ob-

jected.” , ~

”They [CMU fraternities] con-
structed some type. of building in-
front of their fraternity houses,”
said John Bauer, captain in
charge of code enforcement for
the Pittsburgh Bureau Fire
Department. ”They burned these
structures down in the past which
is simply not allowed. We just as-
sumed this may happen again.”

Bauer said that the Pittsburgh
Fire Department hasn't focused
on Pitt as much as CMU.

”It’s these structures they
[CMU fraternities] build which at-

tract our attention,” Bauer said

”We usually have a good
working relationship with the fire
department,” said Campana. I
think they were generally con-
cerned with fire safety. I don't
think it's harassment.”

Brian Albrecht, president of the
CMU Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
said that the fraternity structures
are built for theme parties during
rush and are temporary. I

”I don't understand why they
[the fire department] have taken
a sudden interest in them now,”

-I'.' .1‘ “*' r V

Albrecht said. ” These kind of
things have been.going on for the
past five years.

”We built a cave like entrance
to our heaven and hell theme
party. If fireworks broke out dur-
ing one of the parties, it would
block one of the two fire exits,”
he added.

According to Bauer, the depart-
ment's new fire-safety inspection
policy is primarily aimed at

university dormatories and frater- ‘

nities in the Pittsburgh area.

Republican official 5

 

   

WASHINGTON — Former
Transportation Secretary William

A _. T. Coleman Jr. urged Tuesday

that the Senate turn down the
Supreme Court nomination of

' Robert H. Bork on grounds that

Bork has rejected high court
reasoning in landmark civil rights
and personal liberty cases.
Coleman, who served in the
Ford administration, told the
Senate Judiciary Committee that
Bork ”has repeatedly rejected the
well-established line of Supreme
Court decisions” that hold the
Constitution protects against
government invasion of personal
liberty and privacy.
‘ The first public witness after
B_ork to testify, Coleman is a
Republican who said he supports

V_,President Reagan's basic policies.
‘He led a parade of prominent

people who are to testify for or
against Bork.

Coleman told the senators, ”|n-
cluded in the substantive liberty
interests that Judge Bork would
remove from constitutional pro-
tection is an individual’s right to

privacy — the right to be left
alone.”

He also objected to Bork’s stat-
ed view that several leading con-
stitutional decisions protecting
the rights of blacks were wrong-
ly decided and had no basis in

the Constitution.

Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis R. Bowen, in tes-

Reagan warns Iran to
end the gulf war now

UNITED NATIONS — Presi-
dent Reagan, in a speech to the
United Nations, warned Iran
Tuesday the Security Council
would have ”no choice” but to
impose sanctions if Tehran did
not stop fighting with Iraq in the
Persian Gulf.

He also charged the Soviet Un-
ion with spreading ”the false ac-
cusation” that the presence of
naval warships in the gulf are the
source of tension in the region.

Reagan laid out his views in an
address to the 42nd U.N. Gener-
al Assembly delivered a day be-
fore Iranian President Ali
Khamenei was to give his na-
tion's view of the 7-year-old gulf
war.

The security council's July 20
cease—fire resolution threatened
sanctions against either side for
failure to comply.

Teaching Assistants lead  
interesting, chaotic lives

By Chih-Cheng Yen

For The Pitt News

They, are undeniably an in-
tegral part of the various schools
at Pitt. And many of us have prob-
ably come into contact with them
at one time or another. Love them
or‘ hate them, most of us must
deal with them.

They are teaching assistants.

And most of us who have ever
been assigned one would surely

remember it. for life. For those

who haven't, you have missed a
once—in-a—lifetime experience.
The general impression of a TA

.,would probably be that of a

mumbling foreigner with a
strange, awful accent, who
comes to class, bungles his way
through, and leaves. That is the
general stereotype, and as stereo-
types go, they are seldom correct.

Take Alan Irvine for example.
A graduate of Pitt in sociology, he
is an active member of the out-
doors club. He gets out every one

or two months to go backpack-
ing, canoeing, rock-climbing and
cross-mountain skiing.

He is also actively involved in
the Callrope House, and he is
very interested in folk dance and
music. As a member of the Call-
rope House, he is often doing
concerts. An avid photographer,
he is a member of the cross-
Country cluggers. What's more,
he is a youth-group leader at

‘ church, and he just started doing

some professional story—telling at
nursing homes. ’

Alan teaches two to three hours
a week. He had been assisting for
three semesters but now teaches
his. own class. He has a fair
amount of spare time at present.

He said, however, that life at
the end of the semester is hectic.
That's when he hashis own com-
prehensive exams. Coupled with
this, the papers for the class he
teaches are due at about this
time. These have to be graded
and grades finalized. He makes

time for himself by staying or-
ganized.

Then there is Chen-Tse Lin. A’

Taiwanese who is in the mechan-
ical engineering department,
Chen-Tse started teaching last
term, and in contrast to Alan, is
”very busy.” He teaches approx-
imately 2O hours a week. On top
of this, he spends a lot of time
studying as he is doing 12 credits
and auditing two courses. He also
has two theses and exams com-
ing up.
. Chen-Tse admits that he is un-
der a lot of pressure: pressure try-
ing to be fair while grading, trying
to juggle both work and study,
and language problems. His
problems are not so much in
listening as in teaching in English.

But because he is so busy, he
has not been able to take English
classes.

Now that we know what TAs
must go through, maybe we can

treat them just a little more .

kindly.

Bork

Continued from page 1

Seeburger pointed out that the
argument against Bork is based
mostly on political, social, and
economic issues, but according
to Hodge, President Reagan has
already been more political than
other presidents. .

”To even ask whether this
nomination is political or not is

 

not dealing with reality,” said
Hodge. ”If Rehnquist was nomi-_

nated at this time and place, I

think he would have the same
outcry.”

The role of the Supreme Co_urt
was also discussed.

”The Court is there to decide
issues that come up before it 

t e

 

the Court is not there to change
laws,” said Arch.

According to Hoke, the Court
must also have the capabilities to
interpret the law.

The event was sponsored by
several campus organizations,
and was moderated by WTAE an-
chorman Paul Long.

”The location is in interna-
tional waters at a spot fre-
quently used by commercial
vessels, both those of the Unit-
ed States and of other neutral
nations,” Hoffman said.

He said the attack occurred
at night,» and the helicopters

were able, using night-vision
devices, to identify objects be-.

ing dropped over the side of
the Iranian ship as mines.
”Acting under the rules of
engagement as ordered by the
commander of the Middle East
Task Force, the helicopter en-
gaged the Iranian ship, setting

its stern ablaze,” Hoffman‘

said.

”The fire appears to ‘be out
and theship is dead in the
water. Our ships and aircraft
are standing by to render such
help as may be needed."

The White House said -U.S.
forces acted ”in accordance

,with existing rules of en-

gagement.”

, ”We have previously com-
municated with the Iranian
government the way in which,
we would respond to such
provocative acts
present an immediate risk to
United States ships andto all
ships. United States forces act-

ed in a defensive manner and

in accordance with existing
rules of engagement,” Fitz-
water said.

Hoffman said the helicop-
ters were about I5 miles from
the Jarrett when they observed
the activities of the Iranian ves-

sel. It was only after the air '

crews were sure that the ship
was dropping mines over its

side that the crews asked for -I

and received permission from
Rear Adm. Harold Bernsen to
open fire, the spokesman said.

Q: From the time I started hav-
ing sex, my doctor told me never
to use the pill, and I have the idea

' that men don't enjoy sex as much

using condoms as when they
have.sex really nude. Isn't that
the truth, in spite of all the reas-
surances you sex advisers give,
even though you have good,
practical reasons for telling peo-
ple to use condoms?

A: Don't give yourself a com-
plex about this, or you may have
your‘ sex, spoiled by thinking
about it while your male partner
is having a good time. I will tell
you the truth —— not that I have
been lying up to now —— there is

a loss of sensation for the male
who uses a condom. But it is a
slight loss, and in classrooms I
have demonstrated this by having
students put condoms on their
fingers and ‘touch the fingers of
others. The point of this is not to
show that there is no loss of sen-
sation, but that the things that are
said against condoms are gross
exaggerations.

Q: I went of off the pill four
months ago because my husband
and I want a baby. Can you
recommend any position that
promotes getting pregnant? As-
suming that about now is when
the effectiveness of the pill wears
off, how long should I wait before
consulting a fertility specialist?

A: I know a few positions for in-
tercourse. There really aren't 100,
no matter what anyone says, but.
none that is especially good for
sure—fire pregnancy. If you two
know how to get his semen into

your vagina, you have all you»

Free—agency demand

puts strain on NFL

As this newspaper went to print last night the National Foot-
ball League Players Association was still deciding whether or
not to ‘strike. It is probably safe to assume that the Players As-
sociation's decision was to walk off the job.. '

Last Saturday the NFL Management Council Executive Com-
mittee issued a statement saying that the players’ demand for
free-agency, the main issue at hand, had all but made a‘strike
inevitable. _

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Webster said in yesterday's ed_i-
tion of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the Players Association
should withdrawal its demand for free-agency from the bargain-
in"g table. I ’ '

Added’ Webster, ”It’s not just a problem in football; there are
people out of work, companies closing their doors, all because
of this type of unrest. I don't know what the rhetoric has been
the last few days, but we've got to be able to rectify it.”

Mr. Webster makes one erroneous judgement in his com-
ment. Yes, there are companies closing their doors and peo-
ple losing jobs, but you can bet your bottom dollar that those
companies don't have payrolls where the average salary is so
high. -

Forget the rhetoric, Mr. Webster. No one cares to hear it.

Forget the collective bargaining agreement which expired Au-

gust 31, throw out the free-agency issue, and don't talk about‘

pension plans.

NFL players make an average of over $250,000 a year!. That
says it all. _ ‘

The fact that the players haveeven considered striking shows
their incessantly pompous attitudes. These players live in an
unrealistic world — in our eyes. Their views, unfortunately, are
all too realistic. They know they can afford to strike and they
know they'll eventually get what they want.

The only hope is that the duration of a strike would be long
enough for the players to feel the financial strain that most of

the working world concerns itself with ‘from day to day.

Recent developments in the

keeping an eye on that area. Like
a scary B movie that just won't

there continue on, and very un-
predictably so.

Navies from at least six coun-

The Middle East has always
been volatile, to say the least.
Iraq, allied to an extent with the
Soviet Union, has a profile that
does not lend to a clear cut ”good

Iranians, on the other hand, seem
to get unfavorable attention due
to their ferocity and zealousness.

In recent weeks, Iran has been

wisdom, Iran has attacked Irani-

temperamental.

Not so long ago, one or two Ira-

Does anyone out there remem-
berwhat happened in Munich in
I938? At that time, the entire
world-was extremely fearful that
some oratorical genius was going
to start a war, and n_o one want-
ed that. So what happened?

Neville Chamberlain flew to_

Munich to meet this man, Adolf
Hitler, and ended up forfeiting
the Sudetenland for Czecho-
slovakia.

The other day the Soviet for-

eign minister flew into the Unit-

ed States to continue talking
about
weapons in Europe because
everyone is afraid that having
them there is going to start a war,
and nobody wants that. -
But has anybody noticed that
there has been peace in Europe
for the last 42 years, perhaps one
of the longest spells of its kind on
that continent. Except for a few
small-fries duking it out for dust
on the fringes of civilization,
there has been world peace. And
all the while, we've had nuclear

\ weapons.

Soviet Union is finally listening to
the endless rhetoric that the
White House has been spewing
out about them not wanting to

Chamberlain probably felt the
same way when he was sitting all

alone with Hitler, being told that .

if Czechoslovakia didn't give
Germany the Sudetenland, he
would not be responsible for the
consequences. Chamberlain
didn't want to be the bad guy be-
cause he didn't agree with Hi-
t|er’s- arguments.

Now we are supposed to agree
with Gorbachev that nuclear mis-
siles should be removed from Eu-
rope, and then there will be real
peace there, and both the Unit-

will be able to be content in that
they are trying to ensure world
peace. But if we take our nuclear

1950s was similarly described to
us as a.”police action” -— a con-
flict. It was never offically
declared a war. When two differ-
ent groups shoot at each other,
it's a war.

So America has gotten itself in-
volved in yet another war. The

_sea lanes must be kept open, yes;

oil must continue to flow
throughout the world, yes; but
should we be the policemen
again?A thankless job to say» the
least.

of the opinion that we should

The strike is on; NFL players walk out It

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer I

NEW YORK (AP) —~ NFL play-
ers called their second strike in
six years Monday night, putting
their six—figure salaries on the line
for the freedom to choose where
they work.

"As of midnight tonight (Mon-
day) the players of the National
Football League will be on strike
again,” Gene Upshaw, executive
director of the NFL Players As-
sociation, said in announcing the
strike during halftime of the New
England Patriots—New York Jets
game. ’

”None of us wants this, not the
players, not the fans, not the own-
ers, and that's really, really sad.”

The owners vowed to continue
the season Oct. 4-5, after a one-
week delay, with" non-striking
regulars and free agents who

were told to report Wednesday,
the same day the union planned
to start picketing. The owners
said they would honor requests
for ticket refunds.

The issue was free agency. The A

union demanded that any player
with more than four years’ ex-
perience be free to choose his
team; the owners insisted on
some compensation for teams
losing free agents, a system that
has seen only one player change
teams in a decade.

That was much different from
the 1982 strike, which lasted 57
days and cost seven games of the
16-game schedule. That walkout
was over money, but since then
the average player salary has ris-

en from $90,000 to $230,000 a

yeah ’ .

"Free agency cannot be
summed up in terms of dollars.
It's not about money, it's about

 

dignity and freedom,” Upshaw
said. "It's about who you work
for." .
There had been no talks since
a meeting Friday between Up-
shaw and Management Council
negotiator Jack Donlan, and no
further negotiations were sched-
uled. "The ball is in Gene's
court,” said Jim Conway, assis-
tant executive director of the
Management Council. ‘
The twosides have met 19
times since first exchanging
proposals April 20, and each.has
made just one counterproposal,
both within the last two weeks.
Donlan said he offered conces-
sions Friday on several issues, in-
cluding pension and roster size,

30 days. But Upshaw said the
only specific proposal‘ was to_in-
crease rosters from 4_5 players to
49.

Tuesday, September 22, I987

A Management Council state-
ment Monday said free agency
was the only issue that could not
be settled. .

Although Upshaw told the
players to expect a long strike, he
said it should not take that long
to settle the differences.

''I think you could hammer out
a deal in a matter of a day, but
it will take two or three days to
do the language," Upshaw said.
"If we started today, there would
be no reason there couldn't be
games Sunday. Even if we talked
tomorrow it could ._stilI'be done.
In 1982 they took eight weeks off
and came right back.”

Conway said it would take a lot
longer. "We don't look for this
falling in in 24 hours,” he said.’
"We think the parties have some
hard bargaining between where
we are now and any labor
agreement.”

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH -— The Pitts-
burgh Steelers plan to open a
training camp Wednesday. in
Johnstown, Pa., with about 35
free agents and any players will-
ing to cross picket lines ifthe NFL
Players Association goes on strike

‘Tuesday.

Coach Chuck Noll said he
would welcome strikebreakers to

' the two-a—day workouts and an-

ticipates no problem in coaching
what some players have referred
to as a "scab team.”

"This would be another Pitts-
burgh Steelers team ..
coach the Pittsburgh Steelers no
matter what,” Noll said Monday.

NFL owners voted recently to
resume the regular season Oct. 4
with teams made up of players
waived during training camp and
other free agents. The Steelers
play that day in Atlanta.

Joe Gordon, the Steelers’ busi-
ness manager, said the team has
written or verbal agreements with
35 players and hopes to have 45
players in camp within a few
days. Eleven players cut late in
training camp were paid $1,000
each for agreeing to play during
a strike.

"The majority of (the 35 play-
ers) have been in an NFL training
camp before, some of them with
us," Gordoi said. "They hrve all
been first—cIass collegiate players
and have competed on the major-
college level. We'll have a
team.”

Possible confrontations be-
tween striking players and the
strikebreakers weren't a consider-_
ation in deciding to hold the prac-
tices in Johnstown’s Point
Stadium rather than in Three
Rivers Stadium, Gordon said.

..Cl.ty.a d

"We want to get them outof.

Commissioner Pete Rozelle,
who attended.the Management
Council meeting, said he was just
an observer. '

.”They are so far apart it
wouldn't make sense for me to
intervene -right now,” he said.

Some teams, like Indianapolis, 3

‘V.  .

said they already had full rosters ; I

of free agents to continue the sea-
son, while others had barely
more than one or two players
signed.

Upshaw insisted that the un-
ion’s support was solid, "includ-
ing Chicago, which had so many
question marks around it." _

Dave Duerson, the Bears’ assis-
tant player representative, said
the free agency issue was "blown
all out of proportion,” since the
average NFL career is only 3 to
4 years, anyway. ’

Upshaw, however, said he ‘I

We want to go to the best ploeg‘

to get a team -ready to p|ay.a

Johnstown Mayor Herbert:

problems witha strike—breaking

team practicing in a city of_'

35,000 well—known for its blue-

collar working force and support

of labor unions.
’'I expect we're going to treat
them with the finest hospitality.

We're honored to have them,.”‘.
Pfuhl said. '’I think it's a great,

economic thrust to us for a short

period of time and we're happy"

to have them. I don't see any
problem. If someone has an ob-
jection to it, they have a rightas
American citizens to
whatever they want."
Johnstown, about 70 miles east
of Pittsburgh, is an ideal site for
the camp because it has a stadi-
um that can be used daily," Pfuhl
said. The Steelers can't return to
St. Vincent because dormitory
space there is filled and the foot-

ball fields are being used by the
college's team. . 7

Noll said the idea of a second
strike in six seasons is "crazy 
stupid." -

"l've never seen (a strike) that
was pleasant. I think it's stupid,
the whole thing," he said. "Peo-

ple need to use their own heads I

Last week, I wrote a column

saying that Mike Gottfried’s I987

Panthers resembled an incarna-
tion of the Grail Myth and
described them as truly being in
a Camelot-ian situation.

But this week, things have
changed. The glow from those
fires so resplendant earlier is wan-
ing. The candles of victory are be-

. ing snuffed. The cup of early

season powerhouse victories
from which Gottfried was so pre-
pared to drink ‘has been dashed
from his'lips.

In other words, this week a
Mordred has obviously infiltrated
the ranks.

And what a sense of deja vu.
All I've been able to think about
since that game Saturday is this
pleasant, chubby little Italian man
who,‘ since his stay here, I believe
has moved on to somewhere in
Indiana.

I'm not going to start spouting

“off my own frustrations about

how terribly the team played

against Temple on Saturday or .

how utterly ridiculous they
looked -in certain plays, and over-
all, by losing to an obviously in-
ferior team. I guess I'm just not
that kindof writer.

But, through an acquired anal-

ysis, one for which this specific
game holds hardly any weight at
all, let's try to piece together ex-
actly what happened.

Pitt went into Saturday's game
against Temple with practically
no cares in the world. They had
already won two games this sea-
son, one a 34-0 shutout over the
Wolfpack of North Carolina State
just one week earlier, and the
game before that was their
opener against Brigham Young
which they won by 10 points,
27-17.

The Panther injury list includ-
ed three of their most outstand-

- ing players: Mark Stepnoski, Jerry

Olsavsky and Nate Heyward. But

this had been compensated for by’

the oustanding play of certain
new freshmen players.

The team's rankings had been '

on a steady incline since the
opener. In just two weeks they

had gone from being number 20 '

to number 16.

And, above all, they were play-
ing Temple. In case you didn't
know it, before they played Pitt,
they had been beaten by Boston

_ College 28-7 and had only won

over Toledo (Toledo!) by one
point, I3-I2. Paul Palmer was
not around this year, so there

should have been nothing to be
afraid of, right?

Wrong. .

The final score speaks for itself
as a supplemental answer.

And because -of reasons
unknown working against the
Panthers, the only statement able
to be made directly after the
game, from the coaches and the
players all the way down to the
youngest fans, was, ”What in the
hell happened?”

What in the hell happened
indeed? ~ _

Mike Gottfried looked as if he
had just been put through a

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, September 22, I987

grinder when he had to face the
press directly after the game. He
spoke clearly and seemed on top

of all the questions asked him,

but he was still visibly stunned.

”You’ve got to give Temple the
credit,” he kept repeating,
”you’ve just got to give the credit
to Temple. They beat us fair and
square.”

Of course they beat them fair-
ly and, well, albeit squarely, but
the question is why not how.

But hardly any of the players
couldn't hit the nail on the head
either. '

’’I don't know why,” said Jon
Carter.

”We played hard, but they just
won,” said Billy Owens.

”It seems like we've got a lot
more work to do so we can be-
come more comfortable with our
team and more comfortablewith
the plays the coaches set out for
us,” said Sal Genilla.

Okay, so now that the team is
roaming around ina daze, I at
least am still looking for an an-
swer to this mess. The loss was
more than just bad, it was virtu-
ally inexcusable.

Of any ofthem, I think defen-
sive-end Burt Grossman should
be able to teach his teammates

picket lines. But several veteran

Webster said a strike would be ”a

this week. He has, in my opinion,
the best grasp on the problem
and has already formulated the
best lesson to be learned.

”It’s just like the story of the tur-
tle and the rabbit," he said. ”We
let them go and don't knock them
out and let them stay in until we
can't catch them and then they
win. We've got to stop doing that
and start playing.hard from the
beginning.” .

In the simple analogy to a be-
loved children's fable, Grossman

may have stated the quote of the »

week. And the inherent answer
within it should be obvious to
anyone. -

Many of the Panthers have al-
ready been juggling the idea of a
possible bowl game at the end of
the season this year. If they have
another fiasco like the one this
past Saturday, they might as well
put those thoughts to bed.

To paraphrase John F. Kenne-
dy in his innaugural address, the
energy, the drive and the devo-
tion which they bring to their en-
deavor should light their
expectations and all who follow
them.

But if another Temple goes into

Lady Panther tennis team gets beaten by

Temple, butcatches rebound with Bucknell?

By Frank Sioli

For The Pitt News

The Pitt women's tennis team
broke even in their weekend
matches as a powerful Temple

team crushed the Panthers 8-1

this past Friday.
‘But the ladies bounced right

back for an impresive 6-3 win '

against Bucknell on Sunday.

The other weekend match ver-
sus Villanova on Saturday was
halted due to rain.

In the Bucknell match, sopho-
more No. 1 singles player Tracy
Feltingoff continued playing in
top form as she polished off Amy
Geraldson, 6-2, 6-0. Only begin-
ning her second year with the
Panthers, Feltinoff has shown the
confidence and leadership of a
seasoned veteran.

She seems to watch every
teammate’s match with the same
intensity as if it were her own.
With all these outstanding quali-

‘ties going for her,_ Feltingoff looks

to be one of Pittsburgh's building
blocks of the future.
No. 2 singles player Carrie de-

V Verra is playing her first year in

the number 2 slot after showing
much improvement in her game
from last year.

However, she is also showing
signs of making a tough adjust-
ment. deVerra lost to Bucknell’s
Wendy Howett, 6-2, 6-0.

Despite the loss, deVerra ex-
pressed optimism on her future at
the No. 2 spot and is looking for-
ward to the future competition.

”I think we'll all be able to
bounce back from-this loss and I
know we'll all do" better,” she
said. _

In the No. 3 slot, junior Bonnie
Kartzman overcame a first set 7-5
scare to open the next set'with a
flurry of passing shots and excel-
lent volleys to win, 7-5, 6-2.

Once again, as in previous
matches, the Lady Panthers youn-
ger. players pulled their own

weight, this time against an ex-
perienced Bucknell team.

No.4 Gwen Mclntyre, playing
at the spot for the first time, lost
a tough match to the Bisons’ Su-
san Crockery, 5-7, -5-7.

Still, Mclntire played a solid, all
around match. And being only a
freshman, she is only improving
more by playing these tougher
matches.

And on a slightly humorous .

note, who can deny the intensity
of freshman Sharon Jaffe?
Sporting out of Miami, Fla.,
Jaffe has added just a touch of
sunshine itself to the Pitt tennis
team. She entered this match,
however, in a mild degree of
disaster.
Still waiting for her other con-
tact lens to be processed, Jaffe
was forced to play her match with
only one of her ”synthetic eyes".
‘But vision or no vision, Jaffe re-
fused to be discouraged as she
pounded her opponent with with
an array‘of excellent net volleys

in her 6-2, 6-1 victory.

Playing the No. 6 spot was first _, 
year sophomore Sandy Hunt. No ~ ‘,3
one expected this young lady, ' 
who didn't play at all during her . 

freshman year, to have this much
of an impact so soon. But Hunt

has been working hard ever since ', . it

day one and her efforts were re-

warded on Sunday as she’

trounced Bucknell’-s Missy Mor-

ril in an impressive, 6-2, 6-1 

victory.

. Leading 4-2 going into the dou-« , '
bles matches, the Lady Panthers ~53
needed only one victory for the -' I
win, but pulled off two of the I

doubles matches to make it a 6-3
triumph.
With this victory, the Panthers
improved to 1-3 for the season.
The team built a lot of charac-

ter through their first three tough ti
matches and appear to be head-«

ed for bigger and better times as

they face Robert Morris on Sep— .9 
tember 22 and West Liberty on

September 23.

Jeff VanHorne has got the tal-

very good placekicker, but there
is another equally important fac-
tor figuring into the equation
which added up to honorable
mention All-East honors last year
as a freshman.

’’I miss my family, but I also
miss the town of Cheney, Wash.
itself,” said VanHorne. ”lt’s a
small‘ town with a warm at-
mosphere. Everyone is friendly
and very supportive.

‘ ”They were and still are behind
me all the way,” he continued.
”lt’s nice to know that they care,
which enables me to work and
play that much harder, trying to
be the best that I can be, not only
for myself but for them also.”

VanHorne has set numerous
goals for himself this season,
among them to . be the best
sophomore placekicker in the
country and to simply improve
from one game to the next.

But the key words for the 1987
Panthers are ”team goals,” and
he cited several of those as well.
Being in a Jan. 1 bowl game,
restoring the Pitt tradition and
beating Penn State are three suc
goals. \ -

So far this season, it hasn't been
all that bad. He already has two
for six field goals, however he
would like to bring that figure up
as soon as he can.

But, this week at least, a lot of
people‘ have one question on
their minds. '

A Did he ever think he'd help the
Panther cause by scoring a touch-
down, as he almost had a chance
to do last week against North
Carolina State, during a botched
field goal attempt?

And, conversely, did he ever
thinkhe would have to do that
again then next week in a game
only not be so lucky that time?

”My first reaction in the first
game was, ‘Oh no, he missed the
ball.’ I reached down and picked
up the ball. At first I thought to

‘myself, ‘Go, run for a touch-

‘down.’ Then upon seeing huge
linemen coming towards me, I
came to the quick realization that
I wouldn't get anywhere, so I

anHorne still high kicking as sophomore

turned and pitched the ball to Bil-
ly Osborn. Beneath a pile of
white [N.C. State] jerseys I heard
the crowd roar.”

”But during the second game,
it was different,” he continued,
”a lot different.

”We never prepare for such sit-
uations to happen, and we

‘shouldn't have to. Whatever is

going wrong is ridiculous. This
just shouldn't be happening at
all.”

But ther is one memory Van-
Horne will always cherish.

The roar of the crowd at the
North Carolina State game will
sound to VanHorne like a mere
whisper if he can duplicate the
heroics of last year's Notre Dame
game. That was the game he
kicked a last—minute field goal to
give the Panthers a 10-9 win and
Van Home the biggest thrill of his
kicking career. He wants to be
able to do it again in this year's
Notre Dame game at Pitt Stadium
on Oct. 10.

If VanHorne succeeds ‘in
achieving his goals and helping
the Panthers achieve theirs, Pitt
fans have no onebut the good
folks back in Cheney to thank.

Singletary after the team meeting
on Monday and ”Mike said the
Bears voted to strike unani-
mously.”

Any roster player who does
cross the picket line, Upshaw
said, ”is going to cut his career
short. He'll never be the same
again. His teammates won't like
him, the bitterness will be there.
You never forget the guy who
tried to stab you in the back. And
this is not the type of game that
you need added incentive for

Upshaw said the players had to

be willing to stay. out the rest of
the season. '
”Whenever I've talked to a
team, I said, ’Look, one thing you
have to understand if you walk,
you're walking for _the season,”’

he said. ’’I don't want anyone to ‘

day, two days. it's for the dura-
tion, and they know that."

Volleyball team's victories gettingthin

By Kelly Witt
and Kelley Butt

Tbn PJ'tt News

The Lady Panther volleyball
team traveled to Purdue this past
weekend to participate in the Pur-
due Classic.

In the first round, the Panthers
went up against Louisiana State
University and defeated them
three games to one. Last year,
LSU was ranked in the Top 8 and
is currently ranked in the Top 20.

Coach Shelton Collier said, ”It
was a great win-for our program.
LSU is a nationally respected pro-
gram. It was really significant for
our Pitt team.

”LSU has a lot of national ex-
posure. They are one of the top
teams in.the south. Paired with
the Georgia win, it helped estab-
lish credibility notjust for the Pitt
program, but for eastern
volleyball.” ,

In the second round, the Pan-
thers fell to Purdue, 3-1. Pitt went
into the match undefeated at 8-0
with a national ranking at stake.
Having just beaten Georgia and

LSU, a win over Purdue would
have meant a national ranking
but, unfortunately, the Panthers
lost.

”This particular defeat was one
of my most disappointing since
I've been coaching here at Pitt,”
said Collier.” We were good
enough to beat Purdue. We sim-
ply didn’t play well enough to do
so.

”We have a team this year that
is good enough to win and be na-
tionally ran_ked,” Collier con-
tinued. ”But we just didn't win
the match.”

In the final match, the Lady
Panthers were defeated by
Nebraska.

Last year, Nebraska finished se-
cond in the nation and is‘current—
ly ranked sixth.

Collier doesn't feel the 3-0 loss
to Nebraska was crucial. ”They
are undefeated and one of thetop
teams in the ‘country; Realizing it
was likely we would lose, we
aimed to raise our level of play,”
he said. ,

Denise Frawley led the Pan-
thers with 44 kills and 37 digs.

Collier said, ”Denise had a

”Purdue was one win away
from being nationally ranked,”
Collier said. ”We still have many
opportunities to break into the

national rankings. We still have
to play Tennessee, Ohio State,
and Houston.

”It may be more motivating
now though,” said Collier, ”be-
