Activities Director To Advise Pitt Programming Council 

By SUE MCFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Andy Smith, newly appointed
director of student activities will act
as adviser to the Pitt Union
Program Council until ‘a successor
can be chosen ‘to replace Nancy
Evans who resigned last month.

Evans, who left to accept a
position with Pitt’s Graduate
School of T Business along with
Sarah Brown, assistant director of
student activities actedas advisers
to the council since last January.

Brown will no longer be in that
position with the council but-will be
fulltime adviser to the School of
General Studies ‘Cabinet and.the
Black Action Society.

“We need to provide more
in-depth services to SGS.to fulﬁll
prior committments to them as well
as the BAS,” Smith said.

Smith, who came to Pitt from the
Community College of Allegheny
County will rely on the extensive
programming experience he gained
while programming major concerts
at Seton Hall College in New
Jersey. While at Seton Hall he was
responsible for programming
concerts such as the Isaac Hayes
and _Donovan concerts. ’

“PUPC is still a relatively young
organization and is not yet finished

deﬁning its ramiﬁcations. It is now -
time to start look_ing_ toward the

._ future,” Smith said.

The program council celebrated
its ﬁrst birthday this past June.
The past year was marred by

controversy when membersiof the ,

Black Action Society charged the
program council with failing to
meet the needs of minority
students (blacks and women). BAS
claimed the program council
deliberately missed the chance to
bring a major concert to campus for
the annual Black Week celebration.

Smith said the program council
will be attempting to meet the

' needs of a broad cross section of

the student ‘body this year.

“Just saying that PUPC failed,

to meet the needs of _BAS is an
oversimpliﬁcation of- what happen-

ed, although it is good to look
at what has gone on in the past
to see why things are the way they
are today.” '

Smith added that BAS has not
approached him about the type of
programming being planned by the
programming. council for the
coming year.

‘‘I welcome any member of any
student organization into my office
because now is deﬁnitely the time

to open up a dialogue beween the.

office of student activities and the
students,” Smith said. H

The program council also came
under attack last year because of a
breakage ofa contract between the
ofﬁce of student activities and the

September 7,T1979i

program council. The contract
stipulates that students are not
permitted to produce major con-
certs at Pitt. ' " . '

Smith said. '

“If the time came when students.

would be producing major con-
certs, it would have to be a concert

needs of all the students,” Smith
said. “A single concert with .a

want to wait two more months,”
Galanski said. '

Board members Cindy DeMat-

will serve on a search committee

handle allocations rather‘ than
choosing a group, of students

Stu"dent Government Board
.Food Co-opwill be open for
business from 10:30 a.m. to 5
p.m. Thursday and Friday.

Sue Sandler is chairwoman
of the SGB Co-op Committee
this year and she says she
anticipates a bumper crop of
patrons this year like that of the
past three terms.

“There’s just an overwhelm-
ing number of people who want
to shop. there. As ‘far as
expanding, right now we just
don’t have the space,” says
Sandler.

In the past the co-op has

bread, cheese, fresh fruit and
vegetables. This year the
selection will be expanded and

day, and won’t today, but the ..

offered foodstuffs like yogurt, i

those still edible but packaged
in dented cans will be so‘ld’also.

, “We got a good deal on
canned goods.  guy from Del
Monte told us how to avoid the
ones thay may have botulism—
the cans that are bulging,”
says Sandler. _“There’ll also be
whole wheat pretzels, fruit
juices and peanuts. That type '
of ‘midterm munchies stuff,’
but stuff that’s good‘ for you.
It’s not exactly health food.
When people hear that they
think you’re going to feed them
soybean burgers.”

The co-op receives approxi-
mately $6,000 per_ year from
the SGB reserve account. That
amount is put into upfront
accounts with vendors from the
Strip District, the city’s food
warehouse district. , _

When a purchase is made,_

All funds sales are returned
to the SGB'.reserve account,
including any proﬁt.

“We really don’t concern
ourselves with that (proﬁt).
We're interested in providing
good quality, inexpensive food
for students who want that
kind, instead of buying from
big corporate-type stores,”
Sandler says.

All labor is volunteer with

The Office of Residence Life
will make a strong effort this year‘
to determine its effectiveness, ac-
cording to Joann Woodson, direct-
or of ORL. ‘

Woodson was appointed director
of ORL last week by Vice
Chancellor For Student Affairs
Conney.Kimbo to replace former
Director Fred Fonseca, who resign-
ed this summer. The formal
announcement of the appointment
was made yesterday.

“I feel we have a very important
job here and we must sell ourselves
to the university,” Woodson said.

“I want people to know we do a
good job at what we are supposed
to do,” she added.

ofﬁces to facilitate the job of
determining its impact.

The ORL staff‘ will try to conduct
one or two ‘security programs in

because security is the number one
priority, according to Woodson.
Thus far, ORL has made a large
financial committment to security
and security awareness among
students.
Security in the residence halls-
has been a major concern of
‘students since the rash of rapes on

As a result of the increased
criminal ‘activity on campus,
changes in security were instituted
during the summer to curtail
non-resident student access to the
dormitories, including a 24 hour
security’ system.

Woodson says students have

reacted positively to the changes ,g;

thus far although a formal survey of

student opinions has not been '

made.

“We must educate students in

When speaking ‘of the events of

time to start looking to the future of
the program council. ' _

“We have to look past the aspect
of assigning blame, because that is
counterproductive,” Smith ' said.

Chance For College Credit
With A FliCk Of A T.V. SWitCh

By The Associated Press

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Cable
television subscribers in Pennsyl-
vania may soon be able to take
college courses in their living
rooms under a new network formed
Tuesday.

Courses ranging from “Fat
Chance,” a ‘ﬁve-lesson series about
family eating habits, to “The
Business of Writing” are already

being beamed to the Scranton area"

on an experimental basis.

The service will soon be available
by cable TV systems throughout
the state’s northeastern region. It
will gradually be expanded-to all
1.2 million cable TV households in

e the state. ,
The new network, called PENN-g

ARAMA, was created .. by the
Pennsylvania State University and
Pennsylvania Education Commun-
ications Systems, a newly formed‘
nonproﬁt group of cable TV
operators. 5

' “Our mission is to make life-long
learning opportunities ‘as access-
ible as possible to Pennsylvania’s
adults,” said Floyd B. Fischer,
Penn, State’s vice president for
continuing education.
 Under the terms of the partner-
ship, Penn Stateiwill produce the

éprograms and PECS members will

provide a microwave network to
distribute the service. ‘
All programming will originate

from Penn State’s main campus in

Centre County, butthe system will
be available for use by other
colleges and universities.
PENNARAMA will offer a full
range of credit and noncredit

courses for adults, from general

liberal education to professional

and occupational programs.

Students will enroll through
Penn State’s program of Indepen-
dent Study by Correspondence and
will receive printed study mater-
ials, evaluation of written work by
faculty and examinations in credit
courses. '

The service will be broadcast
with no advertising and at no cost
other than the subscriber's
monthly service charge. Persons
wishing to enroll,in the courses,
however, will pay between $18 and
$20 for noncredit courses and about
$38 per credit for credit courses, a
Penn State spokesman-said. ’

Each television lesson will be

repeated many times each week to
allow students to choose the most
convenient viewing time for them.

That way, programs can be‘

watched at home, work or in a
group setting, Penn'Statei officials
said.

' ‘Enrollment in credit courses is
for persons with high school
‘diplomas or the equivalent.

I  J Campus Bus
   I   Step foriisecurity

Almost _every Pitt coed seems to have their per-
sonal story about being accosted on the streets in
Oakland. They all begin, “Guess what happened to
me the other day...“a'nd continue with details about
beingapproached by some strange man. For these
people, memories like being chased by three men

across the parking lot of Mag_ee Women’s Hospital '

still sends shivers down their spine. And they are the
lucky ones who escaped the suffering of a rape, purse
snatching or assault——too often reported by us.

Those students, both male-and female, who liye in
apartments in the Oakland are the most susceptible
to street crime. Since they must travel between cam-

pus buildings such as the library and their apartmen-

ments, off campus students are easy targets.

If the university wishes to make Pitt a secure place
for both resident and off campus students, it must

take more steps to tryto protectstudents. Some’

measures are in effect, but the incredibly simple step
of expanding the campus bus route, which has been
suggested by the Student Government Board, could

_ help greatly to make it safer and easier for students

living in South Oakland to travel to campus.

Kim Watterson designed the proposed bus route,
they wanted to expand it to pass such main spots as
Hillman Library and to pass through both South and
North Oakland, where many Pitt undergraduates
live. Their finished plan was a route that reportedly
starts at -the Hillman Library, travels" up Forbes
Avenue and Criag Street to Centre Avenue, passes
Trees Hall and then winds down Cardiac Hill to
travel through South Oakland via McKee ‘Place,
Bates Street and Bouquet Street.

It seems Galanski and Watterson gained the results

they wanted. As proposed, this route touches the
main points of Trees Hall and Hillman Library and
for the first time gives some consideration to those

students in South Oakland by -traveling on the main
thoroughfare in the area, Bates Street. I ‘

Now, administration officials must make the final

decision whether or not the campus bus route will be , .

expanded to pass through South Oakland. If Pitt is
committed to trying to make this university a safe

place to attend they have no choice but to approve,

the SGB’s suggestion. Failure to ok the bus route
at whatever cost would be a flagrant slap in the face
to off campus students, who need to be protected by
security measures as much as dormitory residents do.

pulls up to.the stoplight.

' The driver is a woman, roughly 21
years old with curly brown hair and wears

. a yellow halter top. She has a pretty face.

The man's about the same age, about
six foot and wears a tee shirt that's cut off

  just below the record store logo on the

V shoes. In fact, except for his attire, he's '

devil.

He’s not in the blue Fire Arrow,
though. Not yet. He’s a hitchhiker and
gets a ride from the female driver after
only five minutes of sticking his thumb

~ ' out‘.

He was also standing on the comer of
Bigelow and Forbes, by the bus stop
there where I was waiting for the 61A one
recent night around 9:15. A

Seeing a hitchhiker bum his latest ride
might not be an unusual occurrence. You
can watch it happen anywherein the city.

But the place where this hitchhiker
scored--and the fact that a woman offered
the ride,--has special significance.

Forbes and Bigelow is a point halfway

. between Tower A and the intersection of

Forbes and Craig, both locations that

Last January a Pittfreshman, Monica

By Margie Stumpf

The Pitt News news editor’

Renee Jones, was raped and strangled in
Tower A and Carol J ursik, a Squirrel Hill
woman, was last seen at the Forbes and
Craig ‘intersection, one week before she
was found under the Commercial Street
Bridge, stabbed to death. ’
When I watched the hitchhiker climb
into the woman’s blue Fire Arrow, Jones
and J ursik came to mind and I shuddered
at my next thought, the horrible details of

the manner in which these women died. '

As I watched the car travel up Forbes,
I began to wonder at that woman’s
foolhardiness.

Is it really possible that people--espe-
cially women--still pick up strangers after
cases like those of Jones and Jursik?
Haven't people become cautious, wary,
suspicious? Don't they all think like Joe
Friday, with questioning, “Dragnet”
minds?

If they don't--again, especially wo-‘

‘men--they can only be classiﬁed as
stupid. Idiots, more precisely, particular-
ly in Oakland, which according to Lt. Leo
Liscio‘ of the Pittsburgh City Police
Service Branch, has the third highest
reported rape rate in the city.

In 1978, the number four district which
includes Oakland, Hazelwood and a small

part of the upper Hill District,‘ had 32
reported rapes or 13.9 percent of all
reported rapes in the city. First place‘ was
taken’ by the North Side with 41, while
Homewood has 40 rapes on record.

There are also statistics compiled on . '

other crimes, like four sticks of dynamite
planted at Oakland hospitals this
summer, and nearly countless incidents
of attacks on joggers, muggings and other
physical assault. -

‘ Oakland is not all ‘fun and games-
While the excitement involved in
beginning a new term‘--discovering new

people, places or acting on new ideas is ,

uplifting--there's always the sobering
reality of the inherent dangers in an
urban area. Monica Renee Jones and
Carol J ursik, sadly, fell into the lap of that
reality. ,

At the risk of sounding like a
spokesperson for the National Safety
Council, I implore everyone on campus
and everyone in Oakland--once more,
women in particular—to be cautious.
Physical assault, even murder, is a solid
statistic and the thought should make you
pause before taking a midnight stroll to
the local watering hol.e or jogging from

the Towers to a friend’s North Oakland ‘_

Of course, lcould be wrong about the.

woman in the Fire Arrow.

Maybe she wasn’t stupid or careless.

Possibly she knew the hitchhiker; I’m not
sure. ' I ~

All I'm positive about is another scene I
saw enroute home on the 61A.

The bus stopped for passengersat the

corner of Forbes and Murray Avenue. A

‘ young woman with long brown hair, ~

standing just outside the open window I
sat next to, leaned over and kissed the

. man‘ beside her.

“Maybe you can’ meet me at my

' place, ’ ’ she‘ said.

“Oh, yeah,” she added as she climbed
aboard, “It’s ‘Pete,’ right?”

 Thornburgh Scraps Odd-Even Fiationings

By The Associated Press 7
HARRISBURG-Gov. Dick Thornburgh
announced yesterday that the odd-even
gasoline purchase system for Pennsyl-

.vania will be scrapped effective at 12:01

a.m. Saturday.

Thornburgh said the $5 minimum
purchase requirement would remain in
effect, however, and he urged Penn-
sylvanians to continue, to conserve
gasoline in every way possible.

“With the summer travef season

virtually over. and gasoline supplies 

stabilizing, odd-even restrictions on

‘purchasing no longer seem necessary,”

the "governor said in, a statement.
 ‘‘I am retaining the minimum purchase

requirement as a backup measure to’

prevent a return to tank-topping and long
lines atservice stations,” he added.

On Wednesday, Delaware Gov. Pierre
duPont has already revoked the odd-even
plan in his state. ,

Thornburgh ordered the odd-even plan
in effect on June 30 as gas lines grew and
supplies shrank throughout the north-
east. The $5_ minimum purchase system
had been implemented a week earlier.

“They have contributed to an energy
saving ‘consciousness that I hope all
_Pennsy}vaniains.‘will continue to _share_ in
the difﬁcult months ahead,” Thornburgh
said. '’

“Reduced gasoline ‘consumption is our
best protection against future shortages

and especially the home heating oil we
must have in order to cope with the
approaching winter,” he added.

Though the odd-even system has been
lifted, Thornburgh said the state's

‘September gasoline supplies are still

about five percent lower than they were a
year ago. *
. The Governor’s Energy Council will

. keep a 24-hour watch on gas supplies in

theimmediate future. .
The governor said he is continuing his

restrictions on travel byestate employees _

and on the use of state vehicles.
He also urged all Pennsylvanians .to
refrain from unnecessary travel and to

rely on car pools and mass transportation

-Need Fornew Draft
-Accordin to Bush

By The Associated Press ‘ ‘
PHILDELPHIA—George Bush,
candidate for the 1980 Republican
nomination ' for president, said
yesterday he favors return of a fair

and equal military draft that would

register women as well as men and
-treat ghetto residents the same as
. those in college.

Bush, a former Texas congress-
' man, former ambassador to the
United Nations-and former director
of the Central Intelligence Agency,.
made the comment during an,
appearance before some 150
University‘ of Pennsylvania stu-
dents.

In a prepared speech, which an
aide said was virtually identical to
one he made Wednesday ‘at the
National Press Club in Washing-
ton, Bush warned that “we must
face up to the fact that the United
States in the 1980s will enter the
‘ most dangerous decade in the past
40 years.’-’ ‘

He said the three main problem 5

international affairs.‘ Bush blasted
politicians who make promises they
cannot keep. He said President
Carter captured the ‘White House
in 1976 by making more than 600

‘ promises and now can’ t keep them.

“That same temptation to
overpromises exists in this election
campaign,’-’ he said. "From all
sides, candidates are under pres-
sure to promise they will-signiﬁ-
cantly increase spending on
energy, make deep cuts in taxes,
and still balance the budget"-and
all in a ﬂash. ,

“Over time, through discipline
and steady policies, those goals can
be achieved.. But any candidate‘

itt Defense Looks Strong, OffenseA

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
. PittNewsStaffWritcr
And you thoughtthe beginning
of school was only hard on
students? Research papers, huge
reading assignments, ﬁnals and

_ mid-terms, to worry about.

Well, consider the plight of Pitt’s
football coach, Jackie Sherrill. Not
-only does he have to worry about
ﬁelding 22 healthy bodies, but he
has to contend with the throng of
Pitt fans who refuse to believe Tony

‘ _ Dorsett and Matt Cavanaugh aren't

 

 

\_

playing for “our” team any more.

Oh this paper, Pitt looks pretty
good. But the question is how
good? ls 8-4 a good season?‘ For

,most teams, yes, but this is

Pittsburgh, the city where most
folks like to equate anything less
than number one with failure.

The Panther offense is the
biggest question mark. Last year,
the Panthers were blessed with
outstanding receivers, but not so
outstanding quarterbacks and of-
fense linemen. But this is where
the familiar sports adage about
experience comes into play.‘ Quar-
terback Rick Trocano, 15 pounds
lighter than last year, has shown
great improvement, particularly in
passing the ball.

.And right behind Trocano is
ifreshman Dan Marino, perhaps the
amostutalented~QB.on the squad, but
also the least -experienced.

.\So'athe Panthers appear set at the
~»most.oriitical position. But the men
xwihocatdh the ball aren’t compara-
lblle to the Steve Gaustads, Gordon
.ll.oeneses., and even the Willie
Collier’s.

As ‘soon as freshman Julius
Dawkins gets over his damaged

C thumb, he should be a starter. But
'a- revolving door situation will

probably exist among ‘Kenny
Bowles, Ralph Still,Cliff Moore and
Keith Williams.

Ben Pryor could be pushed by
two freshmen at tight end, Dennis
Ballard and John Brown, but it’s
unlikely either one will unseat the
junior from Valley High School.

The offensive line has to be
better than last ‘year’s, Sherrill

havinglalready told everyone how

‘Pitt intends to “put our hats on
people’s heads.” . '

The Panthers are well stocked at
the halfback and fullback positions,

“so no need to worry there.

Defensively, “Pitt ﬁgures to be
strong. But several injuries to key
defensive linemen (Bill Neill and
‘Jim Covert), have brought a bit of
worry to the coaching staff. Senior
Dave Bucklew could be making his
first collegiate star against Kansas
next weekend, and he’ll probably
have to_ introduce himself to Greg

V A Meisner. Jerry Boyarsky, Hugh

(Green and Ricky Jackson before
the game, all of whom have seen

much playing time the last two
years.

Pitt’s returning linebacker, Jeff
Pelusi, has been out of action
because of a leg injury, while Yogi
Jones is also hampered. This could
open the door for Steve F.edell, who
has to play somewhere, or Mark
Reichard and Ray Lao.

Mike Christ will probably inherit
Mike Bal£er’s free. safety position,
while Carlton Williamson (also
injured) will be Pitt’s new answer
to Jeff Delaney at strong safety.

.‘ Pitt Bits-Sports Illustrated ex-
cluded Pitt from its top 20...Junior

Siriano Returns to“Run Cross-Country

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s cross country team is
looking to the talent of senior Gary
Siriano to lead it to victory in its
season opener, the Eastern Eight
Tourney, Sept. 29.

Siriano, from Houston, Texas
runs a 4.06 mile and placed ﬁrst in
the college division 5,000 meter
event at the Penn Relays last April.
He missed qualifying (by one
place) for the NCAA cross country
championship at the Lehigh qual-
ifying meet last' year.’

Other honors under Siriano’s
belt include second place ﬁnishes
in the 5,000 meters at the 1979 Pitt

-Invitational, the Virginia _ Relays,

and the Central Collegiate Cham-
pionships. _

‘ ‘One of our major goals this year
is to see Gary qualify this time for

nationals,” said head coach Mike‘

Agostinella.

Agostinella cited the perfor-
mances of Randy Baily, Bob
Landstrom and Jim Herrmann as
being vital to the team’s overall
success.' ‘ .

“With these people we have the
experience. Our job now is to

_ blend this experience with Gary’s

outstanding ability to win,” the

cross country coach said.
Agostinella predicted his team’s

stiffest competition should come

against Villanova in the Eastern.’

The team has also faceda-few
ﬁnancial problems this year.

’ “I guess you might say that we
were forced to face the ﬁnancial
facts of life this year,” Agostinella"
said. '

All university department, both
academic and athletic, were faced
with some notable ﬁscal cutbacks
this year. These cutbacks caused
many coaches to re-assess their
schedules and travel expenses.

“This year we are placing the
majority of our emphasis on indoor
more local events such as the Great
Race,” Agostinella said‘./ “We’re
looking forward’ to'a good year in

This is the first in a series of columns spotlighting
Pitt athletes who spent part of the summer vacation
representing their countries on the basketball court
and track, at the triple-jump pitt and in the pool.
Today: sprinter Gwen Murray.

I have a friend who spent her summer vaction
working in a surgical lab at Pitt. Anpther friend did
nothing but hang around the house and pick up a
farly impressive suntan. Myself, I worked as-a bank
teller. As grade schoolers, everyone had to write at
least one “What I Did Over Summer Vacation”
story, which ran a gamut from camping trips in the
High Sierras to taking the local clan of Barbie dolls
and their numerous friends and relatives to the beach
(a styrofoam ice bucket filled with water).

year, because in recent yearsvery few students here
"have spent their vactions thus. They represented
their countries in international sporting competition.

Sam Clancy, Gwen Murray, Larry Kinney and
Orlando Catinchi all participated in big meets; Clan-
cy and Catinchi were Pan Am Games athletes, while
Murray was part of a U.S. contingent in France and
Kinney competed against the Soviet Union for the
American Athletic Union junior team.

AFter two years with the Pantherettes, Gwen
~Murray, a junior physical education major, holds
almost every Pitt track sprint and relay record.

As a high school senior, she won the state A

220-yard championship and came to Oakland vowing

I never to run the quarter mile.

For a while, it looked as if she would keep that
vow.

As a freshman, Murray easily broke the existing
school records for the indoor and outdoor 220-yards
and 200-meters, and was part of several Pitt relay
teams that had qualified for the Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women national champion-
ships, held that year at the University of Tennessee.

Having shown- promise in the 440-yard dash in
daily workouts, she was soon running the quarter
mile in relays, but she had yet to record open times
in the event. A severely pulled hamstring suffered at
the AIAW meet brought Murray’s seasonto a disap-
pointing close. A

Last season, however, because of a lack of healthy
quarter-milers, Murray was entered in the-440 in‘ dual
meets, where she ran sub—54 second races against
medocre competition. Against West Virginia

‘ University, Murray ran in the outside lane (an un-

desirable lane" in such a racebecause the runner
cannot see her competition until the final 50 yards).
Pushed only by herself, she beat the second-place
finisher by almost 10 seconds.

US Track Trip to France Part of Murray’s ‘Vacation’

Murray qualified for the AIAW meet in several
events, including the 440. This year, untrouabled by
injury, Murray placed ninth in the open 440 and then
went to the AAU national meet in Walnut, Califor-
ma.

Here, the 1979 Pantherette track and field most
valuable player was fifth-place finisher and on the
basis of her performance, was asked to join the U.S.
team which would be competing in a relay meet in
Bourges, France.

In France, Murray’s 1600- meter relay team, with
teammates Pat Jackson, of Prarie View, Texas,
Yolanda Rich, of UCLA and Lorna Forde of Long
Island, N.Y., (one-time world indoor record holder
for 400 meters) set a new American record.

Murray also competed in the National Sports
Festival in Colorado Springs, where she was fifth in

the 400 with a time of 53.6 and was a member of the.

East team’s mile relay.

“I really had a good time and got to meet a lot of
people. This whole- trip was definitely‘ an exper-
ience,” Murray said of her summer jaunt to France.

While she Iists among her goals “going for a 51
(second 440),” ‘Murray would like to spend some of
next summer’s vaction in Eugene, Oregon.

“What I really want is to be invited to the Olympic .

Trials,’:” she said. “Between my Pitt coach and my

. New Image (AAU) coach, there’s a lot of confidence

that I can ‘do it.
' “I’m ready to thi__nkso too.”

Amazing Expos Win 10thStraight; Mets TopPhi|s

By The Associated Press

CHICAGO—Dave Palmer and
Woodie Fryman combined to toss a
six-hitter and Gary Carter slugged
’a solo home run with one in the
ninth ‘ inning yesterday to give
Montreal Expos their 10th stratight

I triumph, a 1-0 victory over the

Chicago Cubs.
Carter’s 20th home run broke up

 a pitching duel between Palmer,

11-11. Palmer struck out three and
walked one before Fryman came on
in the ninth to post his eighth save.

The victory moved the Expos to

Both Pitt Squads

o-Face Polish Spikers

At Trees Tomorrow

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Men’s and women’s volleyball
will begin action tomorrow night
with a taste of international
competition when both men’s and
women’s national squads from
Poland will come to Pittsburgh. At
6 p.m. the women will take on the
of Physical
Education prior to the men’s match
with the Physical Academy of
Olsztyn. Both matches will be a
best of ﬁve contest and will be
played in the Fitzgerald Field
House.

‘' Panther coaches Mike Hebert
and Ray Reilly have teamed up to
bring this top-quality" action to
Pittsburgh. Hebert is preparing
his women for an upcoming west
coast tour next week -where they
will be playing in Southern
California and Hawaii.

The ,Pantherettes competition
will be a third place national team

‘T; under the instruction of Krystyna

Wiecial. The -team ranges in age
from 21-28. Leading the Pitt team
will be captain Cindy Chambers in
the center blocker position. Also
returning for the Pantherettes will
be last season's MVP Kathy
Sonricker.

According to Hebert, the loss of
Pat Montgomery to graduation and
transfer Ingrid Mueller will mean a

- loss of hitting power. But with ﬁve
freshman there will still be ‘a good
deal of depth. The team will be
shorter p but much better defen-
sively. 1

contest the
Panthers will‘ go up against the
Poland‘National Amateur Cham-
pions under coach Lesxek Dorosz.
The men range in age from 22-31
and have played together for a
number of years. The experience

prove to be very tough interna-

Under the direction of new head
coach Reilly (he was an assistant to
Hebert last season before Hebert
decided to head only the girls
team) the Panthers have begun

conditioning practice four months’

before the start of their season.

“Although the men have been
working together for only two
weeks they appear to have a lot of
potential for.their upcoming season
in January,” said Reilly. .“It has
been difficult to prepare them in
such short timefor the competition
they will have to face tomorrow
night.”

There, are only four returning
players from last season. Captain
Jeff Beavers will be back to lead
the team ‘as will be Scott Robbins,

‘ Ricky Camacho, and Brian Devine.
A different type of offense is being
experimented with this year using
only one‘ setter instead of two.
Beavers will be moved to the
hitting spot leaving Robbins as the
lone setter. Recruiting has been
good for Hebert, and Reilly,

bringing a number of "athletes to_

Pitt for volleyball. Among these
will be middle blocker Don Hardin
who should prove to be a big asset
in this second year.

With the ﬂavor of international
competition at Pitt this weekend, a
good deal of experience will be
acquired by both Pitt teams.

“It’s great to play these Polish
teams,” said Hebert, “because
Poland is K‘ the capital of world

volleyball. This top name

competition will be great for our
athletes to go up against, along
with bringing international play to
the’Pittsburgh area.’,’
