Club Will.  

  Meet October 16*’!

Trees “Gym” to be Scene of An-
ogher Gathering of Varsity In-
signia Holders. '

COACH WARNER TO SPEAK

The Varsity Letter Club, one of the
thriving organizations formed last year
to boost the interests of Old Pitt—-
both from an undergraduate and alum-
ni standpoint——will have its second
“get-together” Saturday, October 16th,
after the Carlisle Indian game. It will
be held in the Trees gymnasium,
where the organization meeting was
held last year, and Secretary Robert
E. Grove, ’14, who is working with the

.Alumni Secretary to boo.st the affair, L :
promises a program that will outdo A

anything ever arnanged for a reunion
of this kind. Alumni and undergr.ad-
uate letter men are cordially invited
to attend. ' —

The card tentatively agreed on at a
meeting of the Program C0dmmi*W-*9
last week includes amateur boxing and
wrestling bouts, aquatic exhibitions,
comic and otherwise, by the Univer-
sity swimmers in the Gym Pool,
“movies” of Camp Hamilton, the foot-
ba.ll training camp and comic movies,
and ‘last, but by no means least, a

~ few words by Glenn S. Warner, the
_ new football coach, and seve al of the

better known old time varsity athletic
letter men of the University. The
hour for starting has been set for 8
P. M. and the tax is $1.00 per man.
The entire varsity football squad will
be invited to attend as guests of the
members of the Varsity Letter Club.
Secretary Grove is arranging to send
out this week notices of the gathering
to‘ every man he has record of as

ever winning his “W. U.  or «‘‘P.’’

Of course, the “WUP” men are ‘‘P’’
men now and everyone is a member of
the happy family. Secretary Grove has
record of about 300 of these men and

Wm endeavor to locate many Whose  the last Varsity Club gathering proved’

addresses were not known at the time
of the organization meeting. It i'sn’t
an invitation aﬂair, however, and every
man who won his varsity letter at the
University at any time is cordially in-
vited, to attend whether he receives
the formal notice or not. _
‘*—This meeting of the Varsity Letter
Club should be of even more interest
than the last one. The fact, that
Glenn Warner, the new football coach,
will be there and say a few words
should be a special attraction.
‘doubt almost all our varsity men of
the latter day have seen Warner oh
many ‘occasions and quite a few of
them have played against the wily

Redskins who were coached by him.

for so many years. They have always
admired -the splendidly coached teams
be turned. out at‘Carlis1e. Now is
their chance to meet the man and get
to know him personally. They will
ﬁnd him a splendid character, with the
highest athletic ideals, and the pos-
sessor of a disposition that wins him
friends every place he goes

Warner will no doubt have some
timely remarks regarding the football
situation at Pit;t“and tell what he
thinks our prospects are for the W.
& J. and Penn State games.

The three Pitt County C»lubs——Jeﬂer-
son, Westmoreland and Beaver—--
named in the order of their organiza-
tion,——wi-ll soon start to show real ac-
tivity. again as the time for their an-
nual meeting and banquet approaches.
The Jefferson county club which was
the initial organization of its kind,
will hold a meeting in January. The
Secretary is Fred F. ‘Jordan, ’18, of
Punxsubawney, and the president, Dr.
R. C. Gourley, ’94, also of Punxsutaw-

W. D. HOOKENSMITH, '01.

It will be right after the game with
his old pupils, the Carlisle Indians,
and as the Government School tribe
is said to be pretty strong this year,
the Old »Warrior will know inst about
how things are going to shape up for
the season’s ﬁnal big games.

In addition to Warner, there will be
one or two little» talks by “old timers.”
We all remember how interesting
these were at the last get-togetiher.
The presence of old team mates al-
ways awakens memories ofincidents
in athletic‘ contests when these men
performed themselves, and the young-
er men are interested and inspired
by hearing or them.

The “movies” of the Pitt football
training camp, taken by the Pathe
Weekly management, ‘will be a big
feature. By special arrangement with
the Pathe people, this ﬁlm is" being
secured. It shows Capt. Williamson’s
men practicing up in the mountains
near Windber-—tack1ing the dummy,
pushing the charging machine, scrim-
maging, etc. They are true to life-pic-
tures. The Secretary has seen them
and will vouch for this. In -addition
to the Pitt “movies”, there will be one
or two comics, to keep the; bunch in a
; good humor.

The boxing and wrestling bouts at

ga decided hit and will be repeated.
§Wl1‘i1e boxers will be outside am-
fateurs, the University boys will ap-
ipear in the wrestling matches also.
‘ Coach and Instructor J. T. Taylor of
;the swimming team has been asked
.»to arrange some special stunts in the
 pool, many of them of a comic variety.
§ The affair will wind up with ad-hand
lout “eats” in which Trainer Hunter
jIJo»hnston and Chef “Dory” Moore of
l the Football training house will be the
lchief dispensers. They handled this
,important feature at the organization
tneeting. and everything turned out
éﬁne. Something even more elaborate
. is promised this time.

3 The Varsity Letter Club was organ-
: ized Friday, March 19th, 1914, _and has
a membership of over 100. Wilbur D.
Hockensmith, ’01, of Penn Station,
Pa., is president; Dr. Homer C1 Roe,
’10, and Arthur ,M~cKean, '06 are vice-
presidents, and Robert E. Grove, ’14,
is secretary-treasurer. All men who
have won the varsity athletic insignia
—-the “W. U. P.” or “P.” are eligible
for membership. The oﬁlcial pin is
a diamond shaped lapel pin, with a
gold “P” on blue enamel background.
The buttons are solid gold and sell for
$1.00. Members who .ha.ven’t a button

  GREATEST PENNSYLVANIAN

John A. Brashear, one of Pitt’s fore-
most friends and a‘ former chancellor
of the University, was recently se-
lected as the most eminent man in the
state of Pennsylvania. The oﬂicials
of the Panama-Paciﬁc Exposition
asked Gov. M. G. Brumbaugh to make
this choice. The latter,‘ not wishing
to make this choice himselfwsent let-
ters to the various editors and jour-
nalists of the state, asking them to
make the selection. These men se-
lected John A. Brashear, John Wana-
maker and Russel H. Conwell, of Phil-
adelphia. The ofﬁicials of the Exposi-

‘of these men and conferred on him
the honor of being Pennsylvania’s
foremost man. Of this Pitt is justly
proud. ,

When Dr. Brashear heard of this
he first considered it a joke. Th-en
realizing the honor that was conferred
on him he said: “There are many men
in this state who could be given this
honor. I have been praised -by" differ-
ent mechanical and scientiﬁc societies
in America, but I must say that I am
greatly honored by being named the
leading citizen of the state.”

In his truly unselﬁsh way he attrib-
uted his success to his wife and son-
in-law.

A CORRECTION.

In an article in last week’s Alumni
page of the .Pitt Weekly, telling of our
President, Mr. Coffin’s retirement from
the Jones & Laug-hlin Steel Company
and his new connections, a make up
mishap occurring some place from the
time the copy left the -Secretary’s
office until the paper got in the hands
of readersxprevented it from being
clearly stated. Our article, as origi-
nally worded, was that Mr. Coﬂin has
become vice president of the Knox
Pressed and Welded Steel Company.
He will also attend to the duties of

 

Sales Manager and will devote his en-F

tire time -to the new connection.

The “Pittsburg Dispatch’-’ last Mon-
day, under the column “In Pittsburgh’s
Business World” published a two col-
umn picture of Mr. Coﬂln, with a
sketch of his career.

The response from alumni, ordering

and Penn State games———has been very

‘encouraging and prospects indicate that

this feature will be more popular than
ever with the graduates. The manage-

the fact that alumni are able to get

«rush for reservations grows. Last year

at the W. & J. game, this was empha-

news CC came from Morgantojwn that

R. M. M.urphy manager of the ‘Red

has protested‘ his playing on the
ground that he has hadofour years of
intercollegiate‘athletics. No matter
how the matter is ﬂnallyadjusted it
will make no difference to the rela-

eers, that is unless they attempt to
play him in some contest with one of

meet them on the gridiron this fall it
i.s hardly probable that any trouble is

in part, “I want to begin by saying
that there are two important things to
a man’s makeup. First is his religion,
and the next important thing is what
he does. You twenty-ﬁve students
who are here today to represent the
student body of the University have
assembled to do for the students what

Mc-

they want you to do. The way the
students _ express themselves is
through you. Up until now the

students have looked upon the Stud‘-
ent Senate as a joke, and I can as-
sure you that they might have had

This organization is a vital one. There
must be an awakening on the part of
the students -so that they will look
upon you as the real governing body.

that the laws laid down by you must

SURPRISED!
Certainly you'll be surprised at
the suit values offered in our
men_’s $14.50 Clothes Shop.

The suits we’re selling at this price
were a surprise to us when first we
saw them. We hesitated some
time before deciding to take on a
standard line selling at such a
reasonable price. We feared the
quality could not possibly measure
up to our standard, but the manu-
facturer‘ has proven his line and
the suits themselves have proven
wonders-—the tailoring is so per-
Eect-the models so snappy and up-
to-the-minute—.—the materials so
much above par, and the quality of
the suits as a wh.ole far beyond
what we thought was a possibility
. at such a price.

These suits at $14.50 surely repre-
sent a value that but few, if any,
can duplicate-—they are Pittsbui-gh’s
greatest sellers, and your visit to
this department will give you a
genuine thrill of surprise, for ~

Al. Paul Lefton. .Miscel1aneous Editor
Elliot B. McGrew. . . . .Sporting Editor
Mary Louisa Moye . . . . . . ..Art Editor

controller by \Manager William C. Ar-
ther.

The Dental Editor, Edwin B. Fast
has not returned to school this fall,
and the medical editor, H. H. Sullivan,

is not taking the complete medical

course, which will necessi.t‘ate new ed-
itorial elections in these two depart-
ments.’ The editor and manager from
the School of Pharmacy have not as
yet been elected, but will probably be
chosen in the space, of the next week.
As this school has only a two-year
course, the Junior class has not yet
been organized after the fall registra-
tion. _

The ne-w- School of Chemistry will
be entered in the 1917 Owl as a full-
fledged department for the first time.
R. F. Ferguson has been temporarily
appointed department editor and
Earle N. J essop, department manager.

Work has already been begun on
the annual and it lsthe determination
of the board to have the book in the
hands of the students at least by May
1.

All vacancies will probably be ﬁlled
by the end of the week.

SOCIALIST STUDY CLUB
TO ORGANIZE
NEXT MONDAY.

 

The Pitt Socialist Study Club will
hold its organization meeting at 11:30
a. 111. Monday in room 304 State Hall.
The activities of the club last year at-
tracted many students and alumni.

This club is a chapter of the .Inter-
collegiate Socialist Study, which has
chapters in more than seventy col-
leges and universities in this country.
.The purpose of this club is not to
make socialists or to convert the stu-
dents to socialism, but to study social-
ism pro and con, as well as to study
other modern problems, its oﬂicers
-‘say.

Last year this club conducted fif-
it-een public lectures. The club con-
ducted regular study meetings every
two weeks, at which socialism was
freely discussed, following Sprague’s
text on socialism. /

The club plans to ext-end its work
this year. It has already obtained
some well-known men as speakers.
Among them are: Mrs. J. 0. Miller,
president of the Allegheny County
Equal Suffrage Federation, and John
Spargo of New York, who has written
a greatwmany books onsocialism and
allied subjects and who is the recog-
nized authority on socialism in Amer-
ica; _ . ' _
. The club also plans to form a de-
bating team and arrange several de-
bates with the I. S. S. chapter of the
Carnegie Technical Schools. ‘

JUNIOR mum at
Am Tl] STUDENTS

The Junior Faculty consists of mem-
bers of the faculty including heads of
the Departments, and the most im-
portant vmembers of the staﬁ. This
body is more commonly known as the
Student Advisors.

When the student enters he is re-
ferred to the Dean by a member of
this faculty, who also arranges the
course of study for the student. Af-
ter this attention has been given, the
student is sent at once to what is
known as the Distribution Commit-

ee. .

The function of this committee is
to see that symmetry of the college
course is maintained; that the elec-
tsves arearranged in proper sequence.

Following ‘the examination of the
card specifying the subjects, if satis-
factory, the committee ~ passes upon
it and the student is directed to re-
port to the Dean for ﬁnal approval.

The faculty member who arranges
the course of the student continues
to be his advisor throughout the year.
In the event that the student requires
aid, he is expected to confer with his"
advisor. If it is a matter involving
adjustment of the course, it may be

 

are asked to work

necessary for the Dean, the Faculty
member, and the student to confer
without delay.

In regard to» the new students en-
terlngg the University of "Pittsburgh,

the members of the faculty in charge
of the freshmen attend and matters

dents are considered.

The students, especially at
time, are earnestly appealed to

this
and
in co-operation
with the Junior Faculty. Dean Fet-
terman personally advises them to
approach the-member they are acting
under, _ concerning their course or
other matters of interest pertaining
to the University.

Dean Fetterman also states that
the time is not far distant when each
member of he faculty will have of-
ﬁce facilities. It will then be pos-
sible. for them to set aside an hour,
and in this way. enable the student un-
der their charge to confer with them,
thus ‘eliminating any inconvenience.

The ab-ove system is similar to
the group system installed last year
except’ that the student acts under
the _dirction of that faculty member
who has charge of the subject they
major in.
