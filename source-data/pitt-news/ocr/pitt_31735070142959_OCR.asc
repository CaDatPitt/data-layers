Staff Report

What began as a peaceful gathering‘
of people hoping to see President Barack ‘

Obama last night became an 8-hour-long
protest-turned-riot that damaged Oakland
businesses and prompted police to use
force. S - '

to Schenley Park at 4 p.m. yesterday to see
Obama’s motorcade drive to the Phipps Con-
servatory.

The Obamas were hosting a working din-

ner in the greenhouse for the other G-20
leaders and their spouses. It was a precurser
to the G—20 Summit, which officially opens
tomorrow. i S -

The gathering was peaceful until addi-
tional protesters joined the original group
at around 6 p.m. Police sent in reinforce-
ments as the crowd grew and placed caution
tape near the traﬂic light at the bridge to
Schenley Park.

Demonstrators ripped the tape andbegan
1eap—frogging over one another and toward
the police. 7

Police declared the event an “unlawful
assembly” and warned protesters, in both
English and Spanish, that if they didn’t leave,
they could be arrested or “subject to other
police action.” ’

When the people didn’t move, police
launched a smoke bomb into the group.

Itwas the ﬁrst of many times police would ‘

ﬁre gas or smoke into the crowds, which
eventually grew to include hundreds of, if
not more than 1,000 people.

The crowd simmered down for a few
hours after the initial smoke bomb, at one
point dancing to music provided by the Pitts-
burgh Hare Krishnas.

“It’s imposible for us to be stronger than
them. They’ve sticks and shields, but we’ve

got voices and we can all sing and be louder ’

About 50 people gathered nearithe bridge S

than them,” said one man, who claimed to
be a Chaitanya, or leader, of the Hare Krish-
nas.

Other groups began protesting around
10 pm. A

People marching dressed in all black and
wearing bandanas weaved their way through-

- out Oakland screaming, “We’re here. We’re

queer. We have no fear.” Many other people,
most of whom looked college-aged, joined
the march.

Some of the protesters used bricks to S

bash in windows to McDonald’s, Kinko’s, The
Pitt Shop, Pamela’s and Bruegger’s among
other businesses. They also lit Dumpsters
on ﬁre. -

The group eventually joined the people
protesting in Schenley Plaza and around the
Cathedral of Learning.

They showed up just in time to hear the '

police once again declare the event an “un—
lawful assembly,” at 10:37 p.m. over a loud
speaker system. ' ,

Police threw more than 30 canisters of
gas into the crowds, which were now domi-
nated by mostly college—aged people. Police
surrounded the Cathedral around 11:30 p.m.
and eventually covered the lawn of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. At one point, they marched
through the Schenley Quadrangle-and onto
Towers patio. -

Popping sounds could be heard from the
Union. ’

After one round of the sounds, two people
laid on the ground, one of them over the Pitt
logo on Forbes Avenue.

Officers with batons hovered over one
of the people, who took several minutes to
stand up. V ' ‘ A

Police eventually handcuffed both men.

The police had said they would use “less
lethal weapons” on people who wouldn’t

_ disperse. City police officers in Zone 4, which

covers Oakland, declined to comment last
night. '

Medvedev speaks on politics, re-election

Russian president compares Russia—U.S. relations 50 years ago and now

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

When Russian president Dmitry
Medvedev took the podium in the
Cathedral of Learning’s commons
room yesterday evening, he harked
back to another monumental Russian‘
visitto'Pitt. S ' ’

On this day so years ago, Nikita.

Khruschev, the ﬁrst leader of the
Soviet Union to travel to the United

States, visited the Cathedral’s nation-
ality rooms.

“I hope you won’t ask me the same
questions you asked Nikita,” Medve-
dev said through a translator. “Our
countries have evolved signiﬁcantly
since then.”

He joked that he didn’t share
Khruschev’s political views and, as

a former professor, is receptive to

questions.

f Learning"

Russian and East European Studies
hosted Medvedev in an invitation-
only forum. Medvedev answered
questions from audience members
for about an hour on topics ranging
from the missile defense system to
his relationship with Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
O Students mostly asked questions
in Russian, and Medvedev spoke
in Russian. The audience of more
than 100 had the option to listen to
an English translation with head-
phones.
However, they might have heard
the replies before.

Medvedev said a few times that '

he’s answered the same questions at
other meetings and interviews.

“I have this feeling that I am sit-
ting in this meeting with Barack
Obama,” he said. “I answered this
question [about the missile defense
system] yesterday for about a half
an hour.”

Medvedev, who was elected last
year, said that he’s considering run-
ning for re-election in 2012. Rus-
sian presidents are constitutionally
barred from rtmning for president
for three consecutive terms. Putin,
who served for two terms before
Medvedev, will be eligible to run
against him at the end of this term.

Visiting EU dignitary challenges U.S.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of
the EU Commission, called for in-
creased cooperation between the
United States and the EU in a lecture
today in Alumni Hall.

He calledfor the United States
to be more ambitious in enforcing

g ﬁnancial regulation and supporting

the developing world.

Barroso, who is in Pittsburgh for '

the G—2o Summit, said that the EU
was ready to “pay its fair share” and
live up to its obligations to the devel-
oping world. ' c

He blamed a lack of regulation

of ﬁnancial institutions and unprec- -

edented greed by the market for the
crisis that nearly sent global econo-
mies into free fall.

Cooperation between the United
States and EU could bring about a
consistent ﬁnancial regulatory
framework to help prevent another
crisis, he said.

The developing world needs sup-

port to recover from this crisis and
meet international standards for
environmental emissions, but those
nations also need to act on their own
to justify outside support, the presi-
dent said. ,

“In other words, no action, no
money,” Barroso said in reference

‘ to both the developing world and

developed nations. “No money, no
deal.”

]ohnT.S. Keeler, dean of the Gradu-
ate School ofPublic and International
Affairs, awarded Barroso an honorary
doctorate in public and international
affairs during the luncheon.

Quick & Easy takes onPittsburgh

The Quick 8’ Easy Boys talk touring, writing and concrete

~ Larissa Gula
Stajf Writer

Quick 8: Easy Boys
Sept. 26, 5:30 p.m.
Howler’s Coyote Cafe

Think quick and easy boys.

Now, get your mind out of the gut-
ter and putaneclectic punk-rockband
in the previous image’s place.

The Quick 8: Easy- Boys are “a
power-trio from Portland, Ore., that
creates its own brand of rock ’n’ roll
by rnixingtogether honky—tonk, funk
andaDIYpunk attitude,” accordingto
its Myspace page.

And if anyone wants to even try
to fathom what its sound is like, its
Myspace also suggests imagining “the
Minutemen, Funkadelic and Willie
Nelson rolled into one.”

The band members themselves
ﬁrst came together as a couple of
young guys just lookingfor something
to do together. »

“We all started off playing in dif-
ferent bands in Eugene, Ore., where
we met

going to college,” Michael Goetz
said in an e—mail interview.‘

The three band members were
all around age 24 at the time, added
Goetz. ’_

“As we were all supporters oflocal

music, we would [frequently] cross
paths, and we ﬁnally formed the Quick
and Easy Boys as [a sort of] collabora-
tion,”Goetz said. ,

Sincethatday inzoos, The Quick&
Easy Boys keptinline witl1 its moniker
and quickly made a name for itselfin
Eugene, Ore.

Eventually the group traveled to-
getherto Portland and began building
afan base there, as well.

“It was nice already being in oth-
er bands as far as getting our name
out,” Goetz said. “We all had different
groups of friends that were brought
to the table.” . _

These days, those ﬁrst perfor-
mance areas still hold a strong allure
for the band because of fan loyalty.

“We have the largest pull in Port-
land, Hood River, Eugene [and] some
other surroundingareas. Denver [and]
Flagstaff, [Ariz.,] are pretty good as
well, but we love the home turf. On the
road it seemstobe pretty consistent,”
Goetz said. .

These [days band players Jimmy
Russell, Sean Badders and Goetz each
have stage names, as weH. Russel be-
comes guitarist Elvis O’Reilly. Badders
is bass player Bon Shatsters. And Goetz
hirnselfis drummer Uncle T. Wank-
ster. Each band member functions as
avocalist.

The 2008 release of the band’s al-

bum Bad Decision: Witb
Good People has left
people raving about
its unique and vibrant
sound.

“The album is kind
of aﬁmny story,” Goetz
said. “There was a dif-
ferent drummer origi-
nally, but after he got
a woman and became
increasingly hard to get
ahold of, the band con-
tacted [me] to help get
the album done. And
since that moment, [I]

' becamethe newdrum—

mer.” . ,
For the band, re-
cording the album was
nota fancy task. -
“It was a very low budget, base-

ment record and was kind of thrown .

by the wayside and not really pushed,”
Goetz said. “Since then  [the album
has received] some attention, and [we]

are currently working on anotherwith V

a bit more push behind the it.”

The Quick 8: Easy Boys are cur-
rently on a headlining U.S. tour —— a
change from merely perfotmingas an
opening act for other bands.

When asked about what sort of
insanity has happened on the band’s
tour, Goetz wasn’t sure how to react.

“That’s kind of a loaded question,
and we usually roll by the motto what
happens on the road stays on the
road,” Goetz said. '

“But other than that, I would say i

the craziest and most unfortimate
momentwas in Denver. We had been
partyingwith Lewis Blackallnight and

‘ hopped in a cab to go home when we

were broad-sided by a drunk driver.
[We] spent the night in the ER. The
drummer suffered some pretty severe
wounds and was out for about four
mon .” . _

And what if the band didn’t have
music to keep it occupied?

While he may or may not have ac-

tually adrnitted to these charges, he

certainly implied as much by making
“The Lost Symbol” so danm hard to

“The Lost Symbol” rejoins Har-

Thinking that his days of code-

are behind him, Langdon suddenly
ﬁnds himselfin the middle of another
doozy, this time in Washington D.C.

The story revolves around symbols A

hidden in plain sight throughout our
nation’s capital and the incredible se-
cretour Masonic forefathers were try-

The secret, which the book repeat-
edly promises is “very real,” could
either enlighten mankind or be used

it falls into. Langdon ﬁnds himselfin
the middle of a struggle between pow-

‘ Job fair to bringnetworking, job opportunities

The Pete will host approximately 200 employers at the fall job fair Wednesday

Niki Walters
p Staff Writer

Despite the waning economy,
representatives from hundreds of
companies will come to Pitt next
week in hope of recruiting new
employees. .

About 200 employers from
across the country are expected
to, come to Pitt’s annual Job and
Internship Fair in the Petersen
Events Center from 1 to 5 p.m.
Wednesday.

' The career fair is geared toward
students of all majors and will
feature employment vendors in a
wide range of professions. There
are companies offering jobs and
internships in the business and
nonproﬁt sector, as well as with
government agencies, according
to Cheryl Finlay, director of Pitt’s

Ofﬁce of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance. _

Finlay said attendance at this
year’s fair is about average, despite
the fact that the economy has’in-
ﬂuenced the overall number of re-
cruiters coming to college campus-
es. Finlay said her office has tried

tomaintain close connections with ’

previous fair participants.‘

The companies in attendance
include American Eagle, Macy’s,
Exxon Mobil, Pepsi, Giant Eagle,
the CIA, Delmonte Foods, PPG In-
dustries and Westinghouse Electric
Co. ~

The participating companies
will occupy much of the space in
the Petersen, including both the
event ﬂoor and the concourse
level. Some employers will also be
interviewing students in the Event
Center’s suites.

Finlay encouraged all students,
not only juniors and seniors, to
attend the fair.

. Every student should
 capitalize on the j
' tremendous networking

opportunities available. ’

Cheryl Finlay

“The fair is for freshmen look-

ing to explore career ﬁelds, sopho— ,

mores and juniors seeking intern-
ships and seniors looking for j obs
after graduation,” she said. “Every
student should attend the career

cc 

fair and capitalize on the tremen-
dous networking opportunities
available.” 4

Finlay also said it is impor-
tant to prepare for attending the
fair. She suggested that students
research the companies they are
interested in before they actually
speak to representatives and hand
out resumés. .

Finlay said students should use
the fair as a networking oppor-
tunity and offered some tips for

students when attending the fair. .

“Dress. appropriately,” she said,

recommending conservative busi— ‘
' ness attire. “First impressions

are critical. It is better to be over-
dressed that under-dressed.”
Finlay also said students should
bring several copies of their resu-
més to ‘distribute. She said they
should develop a “plan of attack”

based on thecareer fair layout,
which will be available on the
employment departments‘ web-
site, www.hire.pitt.edu, before
the fair. ‘ I
Students should make the most
of their time with each employer
since it will likely be limited to
about ﬁve minutesor less, Finlay
said. Be outgoing, conﬁdent and

' come prepared with questions and

a “two-miriute speech” that con-
. veys your interestin that company
and what you can offer it.
Finlay also suggested that
students take the time to follow
up with employers to whom the

. speak at the fair by sending a thank- ,

you note or e-mailing them.
“Reafﬁrm your interest in that
company and your qualiﬁcations
for the position or future positions
that may open,” Finlay advised.

College of General Studies offers second chance atdegree

Jayson Myers
Staff Writer

Workingon classes, gettinggood grades
and ﬁnding a job post-graduation are
hard enough for students.

Butbalancingafamily, anadditional
job and apre-established social lifewith
the routine of a college student, like
many College of General Studies stu-
dents do, can be even harder.

While most Pittstudents attend col-
lege in an attempt to start their ﬁrst
career, others, like Rosemary Natale,
a media communications major, are
returning later in their life to start a
second. '

“I have two associate degrees,”Na-
tale said, “but I justkeptﬁndingallthese
geatjob opportimitiesandtheyallsay
the samething— you needabachelor’s
degree. So I decided to come ba ”

Natale explained that it tends to be
demanding to return to college when
onealreadyhasafamilyandcareer. She
said that because she hadn’t attended
college since 1980, when she earned
herﬁrstassociate degree, itwas diﬁicult
to start studying once again.

“I knew itwouldbe diﬂicultto com-
petewiththeyoungerstudents oncam-
pusbut necessaryiflwantedto advance
inacareer,” Natale said inalater e-mail

interview. “I have found it necessary

to attend workshops [critical reading V

techniques, note taking skills, testt:ak-
ingskills] inassistingme inbecominga
more focused/better student.”

Natale combines her course load
with a job inResidence Life and spend-
ing time with her husband and chil-
dren. This is in addition to an array of
extracurricular activities, includingthe
Pitt StaffRowingteam, service at_a local
food bank, the CGS student govem-

gment, a teaching assistant position

and a position as a representative in
the University Senate.

Because of her intense workload,
Natale alternates between taking one
and two classes a semester.

“Ifyou get too overwhelmed,” Na-
tale said, “[the work] just turns into
dread.” Natale encourages people to
retum to college to pursue a second
career. _ '

“Youhaveasmuchto shareasany of
the younger students,” Natale said.

While Natale juggles classes with
reallife,]ason Bolton, asocial sciences
major, has grownfond ofthe academic
experience and hopes to stay a while.

“I have to goto gad school,” Bolton
said, explaining that he intends to ob-
tain a doctorate and enter the occupa-
tional health psychology ﬁeld.

Bolton alreadyhasabachelofs de-
greeinarchitecturefromBakerCollege

everything, in the credit crisis,” Bol-
ton said. “Iwas luckylchoseto re-skill
when I did. I loved the design profes-
sion, though — I just sawthe next big
dip was coming. I decided to go back
to school to prepare forthe new career
that would be necessary after.”
Afull—t1’mé staudentwho works part
time on the side, Bolton sees nothing

_but positives in his decision to change

careers.
“Like a stock portfolio, it’s good to

but with the recession, psychology _

seemed safer.
Bo1ton’s part-time position is with
the Student Affairs department in the

A Graduate School of Public Health,

which he says presents its own set of
challenges. f '

“EX/en though it doesn’t provide
much, I have to stick with awork study
job because currentfederal regulations

exempt,” Bolton said. “Iﬂ gotaseparate
job, I couldn’trnakevery much money
before my ﬁnancial aid would be se-
verely affected, probably preventing
me from attending school at all.” .
Bolton is not the only CGS student
who intends to pursue a graduate de-
gree in the medical sciences. Wendy
Vernier—Lovicks, who is majoring in
natural sciences, said" she decided to

. go back to school after she realized

she wasn’t interested in her previous
career. .
“I worked in printing and publish-

Lovicl<s said later in an e-mail.
Realizingthat she loves science and

‘ wants to help people, Vernier-Lovicks

would like to become a physician as-
sistant. « ‘

“It’s a terriﬁc ﬁeld with a lot of op-
portt1rrities,”.Verr1ier—Lovicks said.
“We’ll be a lot more demanded once
Obama’s health care bill gets passed.” —

Vernier-Lovicks quit her previous
jobtoattend classesﬁilltime, adecision
thatshe said was acceptable because
she only lives with her husband. She
said that her biggest diﬂiculty in re-
ltumingto collegehasbeenher inability
to ﬁt in with the younger members of
her classes. « '

“I look at the average student and V '

think that I could be theirmother,”
Vernier-Lovicks said. .

Vernier—Lovicks said that with her
schedule, it is often diiﬁcult to ﬁnd time
to spend with herfamily. This includes
herhusband,withwhom she schedules
a “date night” in order for the two to
spend time together. '

“But again,” Vernier—Lovicks said,
“this semesteris involvingmuchmore

Pitt admissions not

accepting friend requests

70 percent of colleges use Facebook, but not Pitt

Caitlyn Christenson
Staff Writer

Some high schlml students are using Face-
book to improve their chances of college
admission.

But not the ones applying to Pitt.

A Kaplan survey reported that‘more
than 70 percent of college admissions
officers have received Facebook friend
requests from prospective freshmen, but
Pitt says its admissions department has
encountered no such practice.

“My guess is that most people in the
office wouldn’t accept a friend request if
they didn’t know the perso.n,”rsaid B] Ore,
senior associate admissions director. “We

‘ haven’t heard of the problem happening

before.” ‘
Kristen Campbell,,director of Kaplan’s
college preparatory program, said the

. practice is not a problem. It’s simply an-

other way for prospective college students
to network.
“In the current economic situation,

it may be hard for students to travel to «

schools they are interested in applying
to,” Campbell said. “Being friends with‘
people in the admissions office may create
the opportunity to connect to the school
without visiting it in person.” _

Pitt did not participate in the Kaplan

‘ survey, which asked admissions officers

from 401 of the nation’s top schools about

controversial issues pertaining to the.col-

lege admissions process. ,
Campbell said she thinks the friend re-

quests are another response to the growing i

competitiveness in college admissions.

“Students are in hyper-competitive po— .

sitions, and they are wondering how to
get an edge,” Campbellisaid. “A year” ago,
people were afraid of admissions looking

« on their Facebook pages. Now, students
seem to be taking a proactive approach.‘
- They ‘seem to be saying, ‘If I can be smart
about this and professional about what I ‘

post, I can show another angle of myself
off to admissions ofﬁcersf”

- Campbell theorized thatlschools that‘

are not up to date with online social net-
working probably had not experienced
the friend requests.

“Schools, in general, haven’t ﬁgured out
how to use Facebook,” Campbell said.

To Campbell, universities’ relationships
with Facebook seem to be evolving. Kaplan
reported that 13 percent of US. universi-
ties have developed policies onhow to
use Facebook in admissions procedures
— up from 10 percent last year. Twenty-
one percent of schools reported they are
considering developing policies.

Still, Ore said that it would be inap-
propriate for counselors to set up contacts
through Facebook and that Pitt admis-
sions hadno plans to create a Facebook
policy.

. Campbell said admissions offices
should look at Facebook as a way to expand
their student interest base. She suggested
that admissions ofﬁcers use Facebook as
a “virtual reception area.”

“It’siclose to the same thing as drop-
ping by an admissions office in person,”
Campbell said. “Just the reception area
has expanded onto the Internet.”

Nepotism bad for some, good for most

Molly Green
Columnist

 

Nepotism is a great excuse to use
when you don’t get your way in the
working world. Lately, I would say
it’s second only to “that damn re-
cession.”

Didn’t get that job you applied
for? Nepotism.

Didn’t win the Pennsylvania Lot-
tery this week? I bet that winner was
a son of someone.

When you cry nepotism, no one
questions whether the real reason
for your failure was a poor resumé,
a bad interview or statistical prob-
ability. .

This is because — unlike stu-
pidity and laziness — nepotism is
universally reviled in the United
States.

Ideologically, nepotism is not the
American way. We made that pretty
clear when we told King George III
and the rest of his primogeniture—
ruled country just what they could
do with their overpriced tea. .

But in practice, it is everywhere,
especially in politics and Hollywood.‘

 

   
  
  
  
  
   
 

Candidates bemoan the fact that op-
ponents from the Kennedy, Clinton
or Bush dynasties win elections only
because of their name.

Likewise, Hollywood nepotism
has brought us such musical delights
as Ali Lohan, Miley Cyrus and -
my personal favorite —— Solange
Knowles. People Magazine pretty
much exists to post photographs
of celebrity couples’ babies. Shiloh
]olie—Pitt could make more money
by spitting up on a napkin and sell-
ing it on eBay than I could make in
ayear. -

Despite the ostensible injustice
of it all, it turns out nepotism might
actually be a good thing. A

Apparentlybeingabeneﬁciary of
nepotism improves job performance.
According to Society for Industrial &
Organizational Psychology, Inc., “Be—
cause of a shared values set within
the occupation, the family members
reinforce and support one another’s
involvement in professional develop-
ment. Their level of commitment to
these values may therefore be higher
than the average.”

A column by Klaus Kneale in
Forbes Magazine goes on to add that

there is also something to be said for
genetic talent.

It is true that for every Lohan or
Cyrus, there is a legitimately deserv-
ing child of nepotism. Gwyneth Pal-
trow — despite my disdain for her
and her pretentious, self—indulgent
website GOOP — is a truly talented
actress, for example.

Not to mention, without nepo-

She knew everything.

tism, we might have been deprived
of Solange and her creative use of
fur-and—feather garments.

In fact, I would go as far as to
say that nepotism leaves its greatest
negative impact on its recipients. I,
for instance, was once employed by
my sister, and I have never worked

harder for another employer.

She knew my weaknesses. She
knew when I was slacking off. She
knew everything. She was Darth Vad-
er, and Iwas Luke Skywalker getting
my hand light saber-ed off.

And she had this uncarmy ability
to make me feel as though I was never
reaching my full work potential.

“Do you have your work done?”
she’d ask, not with the casual inquisi-
tiveness of other bosses, but with a
threatening menace ordinarily re-
served forjames Bond villains.

“Uh yeah. Here.” .

» “It looks a little short ...” —— my
sister was a master of passive-ag-
gressive pauses.

In short: She scared me
sh*tless.

Moreover, when you are hired by
a family member, you are constantly
afraid that others are judging you.
You feel like you have to prove that
you could have been hired despite
your powerful sister’s inﬂuence. You
yearn for freedom from the familial
shackles that keep you manacled to
your desk, while your co-workers
leave early.

beneﬁcial to the employer. It’s like
extortion, only better, because it’s
legal. Perhaps that is why in these
tough economic times (that damn
recession!) nepotism is thriving
more than ever.

According to Bloomberg News,
Italy’s postal service is proposing
nepotism as a way to cut costs and
“usher out older workers.” Accord-
ing to the proposed plan, “Workers
 who agree to early retirement
can cede permanent job contracts
to their children.”

While this plan sounds like a good
deal for the job recipient, upon a
closer look, one must consider the
social psychological implications
of becoming the cause of one’s par-
ent’s early retirement. What kind
of pressures would that put on the
new workers?

I feel a little sorry for Solange
now. Perhaps that’s why she wears
strips of face paint across her eyes
and rainbow—pattemed wet suits. She
merely wants to prove her worth.

In ternet important tool in job search

Students can use the Web to show, rather than -tell, potential employers their attributes

Becky Reiser-
Staﬁ” Writer

The Internet makes it easy for
job seekers to bombard poten-
tial employers with applications,
resumes and work samples.

To combat the overuse of on-
line tools such as Monster.com
and CareerBuilder.com, profes-
sors and recent grads at Pitt are
proposing a new idea: personal
websites.

Pam O’Brien, the associate
director of the public and pro-
fessional writing certiﬁcate pro-
gram, recommends that students
post their resumesonline.

“Students should develop an
online portfolio in order to get
a job,” O’Brien said. “This way,
potential employers can see ex-
amples of writing and letters of
recommendation.”

O’Brien also recommends
bringing a CD or DVD containing
your saved website materials to
an interview.

This gives employers an op-
portunity to view a candidate’s
digital materials instantly.

“Instead of telling an em-

ployer they are technologically V

savvy, [students] can showcase
their skills with their website,”
O’Brien said.

Slowly, this trend is catch-
ing on with both Pitt alumni and
graduate students and is becom-
ing a useful tool for jump-starting
a career.

Nicole Kalemnous, a 2009 Pitt
graduate with a bachelor’s degree
in communications and a certiﬁ-
cate in public and professional
writing, said that she was soon
discouraged when searching for
jobs on websites such as Craigslist.
com, PhillyJobs.com and Pitt’s ca-
reer website, FutureLinks.

mail.

In September, Kalemnous re-
sumed her search for jobs in Phila-
delphia, but without the search
engines. Instead, she made a per-
sonal website that listed her re-
sume, references, writing samples
and internship experience.

Since the advent of her online
venture, Kalemnous has had an
interview with a president of a
publishing company that praised
“the material of her portfolio,”
referring to her website.

Areej Sajjad, a student from
Pitt’s Swanson School of Engi-
neering who will graduate in De-
cember, says that websites have
not been useful in her job search
either.

“I don’t like looking online.

Sajjad said. ‘

Sajjad explained that on web-

sites like Monster.com, students ’

Unpaid internships detriment to student, market

lntemships ‘should be treated as an economic rather than educational‘ issue

 
   

Giles Howard ‘

Internships are a popular way for
students to_ learn valuable work-r_e-
lated skills while getting acquainted
with a corporation of their choice.
While many interns are paid for their

‘ work, or at least granted a stipend,

the unpaid internship is a ﬁxture of
college life. —

Students in the social sciences
ﬂock to unpaid internships, work-
ing at non—proﬁts, political offices
and news publications because they
perceive the experienceofworking
for these outﬁts as vital not only to
their college experience but also to
their future career.

-But in this process of working
for experience rather than money,
students are harming themselves
and_the labor market.

First, by working for free, stu-

" . _ dents aretellingemployers thattheir

labor is notvaluable. Remember, in-
ternships vary from ﬁve to 40 hours
per week, and many approach ﬁill—

Columnist "

 

time employment.

Working these kinds of hours
without any compensation except
for “experience” signals that stu-
dents don’t take their skills and time
seriously in the context of a capital-
ist free market. Keep in mind, we
ﬁinction in an economy where hir-
ing and pay are largely determined
by skill.

Certainly, nepotism and other '

preferential hiring actions skew this

metric, but in the majority of situa-

tions, it is an applicant’s ability that
secures him a paying job. And the
fact that it pays is important because
exchanging your skills and time for
nothing but a letter of recommenda-
tion is a reﬂection on how you View
yourself in the job market.
Remember, if companies weren’t
able to dupe a student into photo-

-copying, answering phones and

writing internal memos for free, they
would need to hire a paid secretary.
In any, other economic system, this
demand would give the applicant
leverage to secure compensation for
their time.

But this isn’t only about the in-

dividual‘ college student and the
fact that he’s getting ripped off by
corporations. No, college students
accepting and even clamoring for
unpaid internships affect everyone
by devaluing labor and making it
impossible for students in some ar-

eas totrade their skills and time for
compensation.

For instance, a political science
major wouldbe hard-pressed to ﬁnd
a paid internship in a political office,
and it is almost impossible to ﬁnd
one on Capitol Hill. Instead, there’s
intense competition for unpaid in-
ternships in politics, which makes

,Nw|p."R|.N(; , v  
 

it extremely diﬂicult for a student
to ﬁnd a paid position.

Unpaid internships may teach
students the ins and outs of the
political system, but they make ob-

taining a political education almost

impossible for students who have to
pay their own way through college.
Without income from the internship,
students have to take on second jobs,
rely on family or go further into debt
in order to gain a ﬁrsthand political
education in the nation’s capital.

This-trend is repeated in many

disciplines as students who have to
pay their own way are priced out of
internships. This turns a job market
based on merit and ability into one
based on wealth and connections.
Of course, in some instances, un-
paid internships may be necessary
foraparticular ﬁeld of study, such as
law, but as an overall trend in educa-
tion, unpaid internships should be
discouraged. W
The difficulty is that many col-
leges and universitieshave incor-
porated unpaid internships as part
of their curriculum, encouraging
students to basically perform vol-

unteer work for credit. "Although a
student’s labor can teach him many
things through work experience,
employment should be considered
primarily as an economic question
and only secondarily as an aspect
of education. ,

Treating work as an economic
rather than educational issue will
prepare students for the reality of
their time after college, when se-
curing a job is based on your skills
rather than your willingness to work
for free.

On the whole, unpaid internships
distort the job market, price many
students out of positions incom-
petitive ﬁelds such as politics and
reinforce an unrealistic understand-
ing of post—college work. Universi-
ties should encourage students to
secure the greatest monetary gain
possible for the skills they possess,
rather than support the exchange of
hundreds of hours of labor for little
or no material gain.

Soundtrack to life

A musical guide for the working guy or gal .

Kieran Layton
A6-E Editor

 

Many people like to think they have a so-
called soundtrack to their lives. Having a
bubbly pop song subconsciously blaring
while driving with the windows down or
V playing a brooding indie number to under-

score your worst moods is comforting. It can '

often alleviate unnecessary anxiety or make
a happy moment even better.

More speciﬁcally, there are a number of
songs that are universally appropriate for

moments in every person’s life that involve
careers. Whether you’re getting your ﬁrst
job, losing a job or retiring, let this be a road
map to the melodic comforts that you will
want stuck in your head.

Going in for a job interview: “Because
I’m Awesome,” by The Dollyrots
.For a job interview, one thing the ideal
applicant needs — besides deodorantand
a lack of visible tattoos — is conﬁdence and
charisma. What better way to boost your
self—esteem than listening to a song that
shouts such a message in a completely un-
ironic fashion? _ ' '

Tips to ensure a successful job interview  

From research to attire, there’s plenty of ways to prepare oneself for the dreaded job interview

Tara Nair
For The Pitt News

While the end of summer means
back to school for students, for
many it means back to work.
One of the most crucial steps»
in getting a job is the interview.
It’s the ﬁrst time an employer

B gets a personal sense of what

you’re all about, so it’s important
to highlight why you deserve the
position.

Representatives from Pitt’s
career services and human re-
sources ofﬁces provided us with
a list of tips to follow toensure a
successful interview.

‘ Do some research.

Finding out as much as you
can about the company’s past and
its plans for the future will give
you a good platform. “Knowing
its competitors and products is
crucial,” said Barb Juliussen, as-
sociate director of Career Devel—

, opment. If possible, ﬁnd out who

you’ll be speaking to. There is no
such thing as knowing too much

Plan the night before.
.Pick out your outﬁt and make

a mental schedule of how your ,

Juliussen recommends making a
list of questions to ask the inter—
viewer as a way of showing your
interest in the company.

Look the part.

Dress professionally and con-
servatively —— suits are a, good
choice for men, A—1ine skirts or
pantsuits for women. Avoid heavy
jewelry or strong fragrances.

>“Those are things that distract
the interviewer from what you’re
saying,” Juliussen said. Bring a
leather pad-folio with your re?

sumé and extra paper to jot'down' .

notes or questions. Refrain from
chewing gum, smoking, eating
or. cursing. ‘

“There’s a time and a place for '

that and it’s not at an interview,”

Students choose to stay in
Pittsburgh post-graduation

More than half of recent grads planned to remain in Pittsburgh

g Niki Walters
Staﬁf Writer

V nized that these features

 

It is a popular belief that Pittsburgh is acity
to which students ﬂock for their education
and vacate upon graduation, but this is not
necessarily the case.

“From the survey results of the last two
graduating classes, 2007 and 2008, more

than half of the students surveyed plan to

remain in the Pittsburgh region after gradu-
ation,” said Cheryl Finlay, director of the Of-
ﬁceof Student Employment and Placement
Assistance.

. Finlay "noted that Pittsburgh was .recently
selected America’s Most Livable City because
of its low cost of living, low crime rate, great

educational and cultural opportunities and ,

renowned health ‘care facilities. She recog-

offer students very posi-
tive incentives to stay in
the city after graduation. ‘

Based on asurvey ‘of
2008 graduates, 56 per-
cent of respondents re— ‘
ported that they remain in
Pennsylvania after gradu-
ation and 21 percent indi-
cated Pittsburgh as their
city of residence.

 

Pittsburgh to ﬁnd Work would not present
them the same issues as those with ties to
family here.”

For senior Lindsay Litowitz, what Finlay
said is true. Originally from Lancaster, Pa.,
and with no family in Pittsburgh, she said
she doesn’t feel any signiﬁcant attachment
to the city. ’

“I plan on moving to wherever I can get

' a job afterl graduate,” Litowitz said. “If that‘

happens to be Pittsburgh, that’s ﬁne too, but
it doesn’t have to be.’.’ ''
‘,Farnily.isn’t the only reason that students
become tied to the city, though.
One of the most pivotal factors affecting

a student’s desire to stay in Pittsburgh after ,

graduation, according to Finlay, is his involve-
ment with and degree of connection to the

city during his college years.

Finlay also said that many of the students

lege tend to have a greater connection to
the city than those who decide to live else-
where. V 4
“For those students who have family here,
that could be a big factor in their choosing
to stay. For those students from outside the
region and studying here,‘they have estab-
lished roots elsewhere,” Finlay said. “Leaving

She said that while a sense of connected-

ness to the city and'all of its positive, attri-
_ butes — two championship sports teams,

plenty of recreational opportunities for new
graduates, revitalized neighborhoods, etc. —

are important factors when deciding where .

to live, it ultimately is a unique decision for
each individual. ' ,
For most graduates, that decision will

in likely revolve around job opportunities, as
it does for Litowitz who conﬁded, “Where I

Manyfactors in students’

Location, salary, benefits and love for the job all play a role in a student’s ultimate decision

Simone Cheatham
Staﬂ’ Writer

' Many students value a salary and

beneﬁts when looking for jobs, but
for some, love of the job and rap-

. port with coworkers trumps any

matevrialbeneﬁt.

Finn Skovdal, a Pitt senior
majoring ‘in political science and
minoring in administrative justice
and sociology, said he has been
casually searching for post-grad-
uation jobs since the beginning of
this school year.

’ Skovdal said he hopes to go to
law school, but if the “right op-
portunity,” — meaning the right
salary .—' came along, he would
take it. i K

“Finding a really good job is

, hard now, especially with this

economy,” Skovdal said. “If I were
to pass up lawlschool, it would be
because of a nice job that’s giving
me a nice amount of money. If it’s

' not paying me anything, I would

just wait to‘ make more money after
law school.” —
Skovdal also said the location of

l 0 Outside the
Classroom Curriculum
Your nu Pathway ,

 

such a job would be important, too.
Born and raised near Philadelphia,
he said he would prefer to stay in a
larger city “where more opportu-
nities are always available.”

“But if a small town job offered
me a lot of money, I would have to
reconsider,” he added.

Cheryl Finlay, director of the
Office of Student Employment
and Placement Assistance, said
salary and location can determine
whether a student accepts a job,
but everyone has, different con-
cerns thatcome into play, too.

“For some, location is a key
factor, for others opportunity for

‘advancement and for others sal-

ary and/or beneﬁts,” Finlay said.
“Everybody is different.”

But Finlay also advised students
to be more “open to different op-
portunities and less selective” in
today’s job market, at least until
the economy bounces back.

Pierce Ivery is one student who
is taking her advice. A senior ma-
joring in industrial engineering,
Ivery has started looking for jobs

on anything yet.

“I’m pretty open to anything
right now,” Ivery said. “There are
deﬁnitely opportunities that seem
to be coming around, but I’m just
weighing my options.” ’

. Ivery said he plans to go to
graduate school at some point, but

on the spot.”

V Instead of looking for jobs,
some students have opted for
internships. Finlay said students
should be “more receptive to

» internships and intermediate

jobs.”

would like to have some job‘experi-
ence before applying to schools.
He said he’s hoping to ﬁnd a job
that would help reimburse him for
graduate schoolcost.

.-“That’s one thing that would
really help me out,” Ivery said. “I
really like this field, and if I could
ﬁnd a job that would help pay for
me to go .back to school‘? That
would be absolutely amazing. I’d

ing in applied developmental psy-
chology, recently started working
at an internship with a school de-
signedto aid children with behav-
ioral and developmental challeng-
es. She said the internship quickly

turned into a better experience ‘

than she had expected.

“I’m loving what I’m doing,”
Strong said. “At ﬁrst, I only wanted
an internship that was somehow
related to my major, but this is het-

ﬁt. She said in the future she will?’
look for jobs that satisfy her love

. for children rather than great fi-

nancial stability.

“I realize that I really love
working with kids because of this
internship,” Strong said. “And I‘
think that’s one of the most im-
portant things that someone can
look for in a job. Who wants to go
to work every day and hate what
they’re doing?”

I have been dreading the prospect of looking for
a job for several reasons. First, I don’t have time.
Second, lookingfor a job requiresthinkingabout
havingajob,whichis depressing.Third, asfaras
I’ve heard, there aren’t many jobs to behad inthis
economy, so I probably won’tﬁnd one anyway.
Sadly, I won’t be in college forever. But while

I’m here, I might as well take advantage of Pitt’s
services. Ipicked up the phone, dialed the Career
Services oﬂice and scheduled an appointment.

“What would you like to cover in your meet-
ing?” the receptionist asked politely.

“Uh, ﬁnding ajo ,” I said meekly. That was. a
dumb answer. She already knewthat.

“OK, and what is your major?” she asked.

“Nonﬁction writing,”. I answered, this time
with a little more conﬁdence.

“someonecanseeyoutomorrowatl,” she said.
I hung up the phone feeling quite accomplished.

Finally, I hadtakentheﬁrststep.

By punk—rock girl group The Dollyrots,
the song could really be sung for a potential
employer in lieu of a resumé and practically
ensure future employment. Actually, don’t
do that, but having lyrics like, “I’m a leader.
I’m a winner, and I’m cleaner / ’Cause I’m
awesome,” coursing through your head will
bring nothing’ but positive thoughts.

Congratulations! You_have a

Your ﬁrst day, in the ofﬁce: “Working

This is the moment yoLi’ve been wait-

impression on your boss and co-workers,
and you are excited to dive headﬁrst into
a pile of interesting and fascinating work
that surely awaits you at your new office
(or cubicle).

Sadly, no song ﬁts your state of delusion. V

But when you ﬁnally realize that the job
isn’t everything you thought it would be,
this little ditty will become your manifesto.
Plus, stuffy offices worldwide are practically
required to simultaneously turn their radios
on when this song plays. Just like gossip,
the song “Working for the Weekend” is a
staple at ofﬁces around the world. And just
try getting the chorus out of your head — I
dare you. . ,

You have to wakeup at 7 a.m. after get-

“It’s just one of those days when you
don’t wanna wake up / Everything is f***ed.

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt says North Carolina State’s defensive line is full of athletic playmakers, much like Pitt’s own defense

Nate Byham and Pitt faces its toughest test Saturday against NC State

HOTOGRAPHE

A Greg Trietley
Staﬁ“ Writer

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull led his team
to three straight victories to start the
season, but on Saturday he faces his
toughest challenge this year when
Pitt travels to Raleigh to face North

_ Carolina State. '

“Ifyou look at our schedule, we’ve
taken a step up from a competition
standpoint every week,” Pitt coach
Dave Wannstedt said. -

Stull’s performance against Navy
impressed Wannstedt, who hopes
the trend continues against North
Carolina State.

“The thingl like that he’s doing is
making smart decisions,” Wannstedt
said. “He’s making quicker decisions.
He’s not holding on to the ball.”

Stull and the Panthers will have to
make those decisions againstastingy
North Carolina State defense. The
Wolfpack ranks second in the country

in total defense after holding South
Carolina, Murray State and Gardner-
Webb to an average of 168 yards per
game. 3

But Stull might have an advantage
against North Carolina State, because
he practices against Pitt’s defense.

“Their defensive line looks very
similar to ours,” Wannstedt said.
“Those four guys they have up front
are playmakers. They can all run and
they’re athletic.”

Though Stull has been impressive,
passing for six touchdowns with a
160.2 passer rating, North Carolina
State quarterback Russell Wilson

has been even better. Wilson has an

NCAA-record 329 passes without an

V interception.

“He understands what wins and
loses football games,” Wannstedt
said. “Their tight end right now is
their leading receiver. Their running

back is their fourth-leading receiver. ‘

That tells. you that he’ll take the shots
down the ﬁeld, but he will also take

what the defense gives him.”

' The status ofPitt linebacker Adam?»

Gurm, who missed the game against
Navy with a sprained left ankle, is still
up in the air. Dan Mason performed
beyond expectations in Gunn’s place
last week, recordinga team-leading11
tackles to go with two sacks.

“I really am not prepared right

I now to say if Adam’s going to play

and if Adam’s going to start [or] how
much Dan Masonwill play,” Wannst-
edt said.

Pitt defeated North Carolina State
in its last meeting, 34-19, at the 2003?"
Tangerine Bowl. The Panthers hand-
ed Philip Rivers his only bowl loss as
a member of the Wolfpack.

For Wannstedt, though, that game
and this season’s ﬁrst three games
are in the past. The only thing that
matters is the test of North Carolina
State. ‘

“We have a big challenge ahead of
us,” Wannstedt said. “It’s the biggest
one of the year so far.”

-The quarterback-wide receiver combo combined for three touchdowns in the Orange ’s 37-34 win over Northwestern

. Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

after a year of disappointment —— and
probably depression for some Orange

A ' faithﬁil -— Syracuse ﬁnally notched

its ﬁrst victory under new head coach
Doug Marrone in a-37-34 win over
Northwestern.

Two players,.wide receiver Mike '

Williams and quarterback GregPaulus,
led the Orange offensive attack. Wil-
liams caught 11 passes for 209 yards,
and Paulus threwfor 346yardsandtwo
touchdowns and ran for another.

The impressive part is neither of
those players played football last year.

Paulus rriade national headlines
after he transitioned from Duke point
guard to Syracuse quarterback.

“It’s unbelievable to me that he’s
only really been practicing football
since we started the preseason six or
seven weeks ago,’_’ Marrone said in a
teleconference. ‘Togoagainst [aNor1ii-
westemteam] thatret1irnedeightof11
starters on defense and to have one of
the bastpassingperformancesinrecent
memory here is incredible.”

Williams, on the other hand,-was
suspended for violating the Syracuse’s
Academic Integrity Policy last fall.
Williams said in reports he was caught
cheating after he had his notes on his
desk before an exam. ,

The 2007 all-Big East second team
selection was required to take classes
and maintainac-averageinthemwhile
away from Syracuse.

Williarris earnedBsandisnowback
as Syracuse’s leading receiver after a
year off}

“Itbinkit’s acredit to both ofthose
players and the position coaches, get-

_tingthem caiightup to speed and get-

ting them out there and competing,”
Marrone said.

In other news, it was a sad week
to be a South Florida fan. Bulls quar-
terback, senior Matt Grothe, arguably
their best player, suffered a torn ACL,
endinghis senior season. ‘

Grothe will apply for a medical
redshirt. Butbecause he redshirtedhis
freshmanyear, it lookslikethe career of
the Big East’s all-time leader in yards is
probably over.

ed the correct answer: Julius Dawkins
(against Cincinnati andArmy) in1981,
and Billy Davis (Rutgers) in1994. Each
caught four touchdown ‘passes in one

Mike Williams, Syracuse — Wil-

liams had 11 catches for a whopping ‘

209 yards and two touchdowns in the
Orange’s thrilling 37-34 victory over

the Week (Defensive)
Dan Mason, Pitt— Mason had 11tacl<les
and two sacks in his ﬁrst start, but the

as they allowed 129 rushingyards and
notched six sacks. -
