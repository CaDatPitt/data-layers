Campus CopsStrike Over
Reprimands, Dismissals  

by MIKE MILLER
re.‘ Editor i
C  The Campus Police punctuated
a summer of management disagree
‘ ments with a 24 hour unauthorized
wild cat strike on August 17. The
dismissal of Union Steward John
Forgie and Officer Arnold .Tarr
precipitated the work stopage.
‘The officers claimed that the
dismissals of Tarr and Forgie were
a culmination of a series of harrass-

ments perpetrated by Superintend- .

ent of Campus Police Joseph Gil
as reprisals for their becoming
uﬁonized.

The “liarassment” has been in
" s , the form of strict enforcement of
I '5 rules and directives in the form of
 reprimands and suspensions
= "which Gil defended as, "the dis-
cipline necessary in "a paramili-
tary‘organization.” ' - I

The most recent disciplinary
action involved the suspension

    
  

a distress call from city policemen
who were involved in a gun battle.
at theicorner of Louise and McKee
Place in ‘South Oakland.

Offi’cers4_Ed Foster and Tony
Glowczewski received the dis-

iiélﬁoos Organization

of two__ officers for responding to _

tress call over a city monitor in-
stalled in their patrol car. The reg-
ular patrol vehicles are not equip-
ped with monitors, however the
men were using the,sargent‘s car
due to the breakdown of a regular
vehicle. The monitor permits

the men to listen to city police
calls but d_oes not provide two way
communication. A

The officers were suspended.
according to Gil, for disobeying a
directive which requires the men
to have the consent of their super-
visor before responding to city
calls.

“We‘re arguing on a moral as-
pect," Foster said. “There were
two lives in danger and this is
what we responded to—the dan-
ger of loss of life.”

Foster said that he had been
told by Gil that he would be “held
accountable for statements made
reflecting discredit upon the Uni-
_versity.”

He also claimed that police of-
ficers are required by law to aid
other officers in distress at any-
time.

Gil said that the primary respon-
sibility of his men entails protec-
tion of the faculty, staff, students
and property of the University.
"Indiscriminantly becoming in-
volved in other work’ results in
loss of these services,” he said.

Gil stated that the shooting in-
cident took place one block from
Police Patrol Station 4 where a roll
call was in progress and therefore
a sufficient number of city police-

 Shriver Blasts Nixon Record

_ 7 By MIKE MILLER

_‘ I ‘R. Sargent‘ Shriver, the Demo-

‘,;craticv vice-presidential candi-
’ date,’ blasted_President,Nixon for

maintaining, “The worst record
2 of‘ any president in the history
of this country,” in a speech at
the recent Staisey-Foerester Bas-
ket Picnic in South Park.

_The annual_picnic serves as
the kick-of for the Democratic
campaign in the county and is
attended by large numbers of
Western Pennsylvania organiza-
tion Democrats’;

_¥ Shriver called Nixon, “Ameri-
\ ca’s_first television prime time
president” and labeled the Re-
publican National Convention
“a‘Disneyland tour.”

I He" attacked Nixon’s foreign
A .3policy saying, "He has had 1,403,
3 days to end the war and he has "
1 failed on, everyone of those days,
and, now with only 75 days left
2, he has Henry Kissinger zooming
around like superman.”
‘Z_}‘.‘ering to Nixon’s trips to.
Russia and China, Shriver said,
, "While he (Nixon) was showing
:3 you what the great wall looks like
1%/.»20,000 men were dying in South
*5‘ East Asia.”

Regarding the alleged bugging
of Democratic headquarters by
the Committee to Re—elect the
President he said, "Nixon "said he
_would end crime in the streets.
.but crime has gone up every-
where and even entered into the
executive suite of high govern-
ment officials." The incident.
Shriver claimed, “Proves Nixon's
idea of a party line is a_ bugged
telephone.
.,.  He attacked Nixon’s 1968 cam-
I-;valgn promise tomaintain a bal-

4-
O

anced budget claiming that the

president has accumulated, “The '

biggest deficit in the peacetime
history of the United States.” He
also said that prices have gone up
while wages have been frozen
and the number of jobs has de-
creased.

ty line is a bugged te|ephone.”‘

Shriver criticized Nixon’s ve-

— toing of the Manpower Bill, Pub-

lic Service Jobs and the HEW
Appropriations Bill because they
were inflationary.

"Everything that is good f'or you
is inflationary and all that isn‘t
is what’s good for U.S. Steel and
Bethlehem Steel."

"Nixon’s welfare programs are
for the corporations and not for
the needy," he said, citing tax

_breaks and loopholes which »’these

corporations have used.

He took issue with Nixon’s re-
cent claim that unemployment has

»"decreased,; ‘-‘Let himcenie to Pitts-i »

burgh and say that. There is more
unemployment here than there
was under that great president,
Herbert Hoover.

“Nixon says that he won’t make
the people pay for those who
don’t want to work while 100,000

' steel workers in Pittsburgh are’

saying, ‘We want to work, but
where are the jobs?’ ”

Shriver conceded that the
Democrats are now underdogs,
but said, “By the ‘time the Pir-
ates open the World Series down-
town we won’t be the under-
dogsf’

County Commissioner Leonard
Staisey called for a united effort
on the part of all Democrats to
help elect McGovern and Shriv-
er and said that those who were
pesimistic could. bereplaced. J

gamated Food Employees Local

men were available to answer the
distress call.

He also said that officers are re-
quired to respond to distress situ-
ations that they directly observe,
but that Foster and Glowczewski
were eight blocks away from the
incident and not one block away
as they claimed.

“The biggest danger in a fire
fight is the intrusion of parties

‘not’ in direct communication with

the ‘people involved,” Gil said.

He cited the recent shooting of .

two off duty officers during a
bank hold up in Penn Hills shop-
ping center. when they were mis-
taken for the culprits by other
officers. ‘

“The Penalty was intended to
cause them to consider whether
they are going to disregard de-
partmental directives,” Gil said.

He also reported that, “Inspec-
tor Hagie (of station number 4 ) and
the lieutenant have asked us to
warn our men not to come into
their business unless requested.“
Gil also said that he___did not want
city officerscoming onto the cam-
pus and involvingthemselves in
campus police work.

Inspector Hagie was vacation-
ing when called for comment, but
Lieutenant Dinwiddie, who was
serving in Hagie"s place said, “We
have never complained. This is

an internal matter for the campus ,

police and we resent being drawn
into it by someone saying- that
we've complained.”

The striking officers also com-
plained of disciplinary action taken
against them for a work stoppage
during the previous week -when

several officers walked off the‘

job.

Officer Lew Broner said that i‘

he was reprimanded for refusing

. to work after he had put in a 51

hour week.’ Officer Perella said
that he too was reprimanded for

participating in the stoppage when _

he was sick. He said he had a
doctors certificate excusing him
from work.

Other men said that they had

been reprimanded for taking the

day as a sick day. The reprimands
consisted of letters in their file.

Gil said that “If any officer has
been disciplined and has a proper

excuse it will be considered. In 

this situation it was difficult to

identify individual circumstances!’ ._

Adjudication Group to

Ease Registration Woes

An “Operations Registration
Adjudication Group” has‘ been
formed at the request of Vice
Chancellor of Operations Joseph
Dutton. The Group is intended to
facilitate “prompt and equitable
adjudication of student problems
relating to Registrar Office course
scheduling, invoicing and stud-
ent record keeping.”

According to Robert -Hickey,
assistant registrar, the group» is
intended to help all students both
full and part time in all schools.

The ground floor desk in the
Cathedral is being used as the
groups headquarters. They are
equipped with an on-line com-
puter, terminal which, according
to Hickey, enables the group to
“quiz the master computer in-
stantly.”

Given the student’s last name
and social security number the
terminal displays all of the infor-
mation in the master comput-
er on a television screen. '

Students who want a waiverof
a late fee, who have lost invoices,
or who have any problem relat-
ed to registration, invoicing or
records can make use of the fa-
cility.

‘Hickey pointed out that this_
was the University’s.first attempt
to solve student problems in
these areas. He said that the group
would make a log of .all student
complaints and attempt to dis-
cover common complaints and

V rectify them during the. winter

'._\

term.

The Group will be available at
the ground floor Cathedral desk
from 9:30 a.m. to noon and 2:30
p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through
Thursday and from 9:30 a.m. to
noon and 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on
Fridays, until September 29.

Dental Schoqol Faces

The School of Dental Medi-
cine is confronted with the loss
of its accreditation by the Ameri-
can Dental Association due to a
shortage of faculty.

Dr. Edward J. Forrest, Dean of
the School of Dental Medicine.
explained that the problem stem-
med from the construction of a
new building payed for by state
and federal funds. ' _‘

“One of the conditions for're-
ceiving the money was to enroll
more students,” Forrest ‘said,

‘we did this but we couldn’t keep

pace with the faculty.”

The school received “accredi-
tation with conditions” after ‘an
evaluation by the American Den-
tal Association’s Council on Den-
tal_Education. .

This gives the school two years
to rectify the problem. Forrest

» hopes to increase the faculty by

 Loss of “Accreditation

930 before spring. The school cur-

rently/has 95 full time and 120
part tithe faculty members.

Forrest reports hiring 15 new
faculty members and he feels
that this number should satisfy
the ADA. However, the school
is trying to recruit an additional
15 members by spring.

Forrest also pointed out that
the University was not unique
in its problems. The University
of St. Louis and Loyola Univer-
sity have had to close their Den-
tal Schools due to the financial
bite.

He also reported that the Den-
tal School has made requests to
the State Legislature f'or direct
subsidies just as the‘ medical
schools receive. '

“We’re looking for state and
federal help if we’re going to
turn out quality doctors and den-
tists," Forrest said.

This _fall Blue Cross Blue Shield
will offer a health insurance pro-

‘gram to University students. re- '
placing the previously used Stroth---

man and Mock policy.

The new policy was created
by the Medical Action committee

A of the Student Government. Ac-

‘..-._.i’iv_1_,-

i new

cording to Carol Wolicki. the
committees chairwoman, "We de-

cided on a new policy because
gitrothmanl and Mock couldn‘t
 give a better deal than Blue Cross

.-Blue Shield, which is supposed to

Ca one of the best policies around.

“We spent nearly four months
setting up the new insurance pro-
gram, collaborating with Dr. Jo-
seph Hinchliffe, Director of the
Student Health Center.“

Eeland Deck, risk Manager
who buys all insurance protect-
ing the University,‘ said, “This
insurance package, _
up, of the Blue Cross, Blue
Shield, and Major Medical pro-
grams, is assumed to be the best
insurance program in the -United

 - States.”

-Deck served as a consultant
to»the Medical Action Commit-

tee’ and designed the new single ’

student and family insurance
programs. ‘
He said. “The University of
‘Maryland is ready to adopt’ this
program. and I keep getting
calls asking how I was able to

' I put this packrgi together». This

program is so good. in fact. that

' the. Assistant Dean of.Medicine.

Dr. Edward Peterson. is urgin;_
_medical students to get it."

_ Tom Bailey, Student Govern-
.ment president, also commented
on the new insurance program.

é-;“B/lue Cross and Blue Shield
"V. came up with what we wanted

plus more, and I personally feel
this policy is fantastic. I’ve talk-
ed to insurance men about it and
they feel the same way I do.

"Student Government support-
'ed'the,policy that the Medical
Action Committee and its former
chairman, Marc Hiller. created.
They. really did a lot of work on

it and it‘s great. I wish‘ Student -'
Government could take all they

. sure until

credit for it, but unfortunately
we can‘t.“ Bailey said.

Sandra Beatovic, Administra-
tive Assistant for the Student
Health Center said. "We had
good co-operation. administrative-
ly, with the old company. but
students complained about its
program. The new policy appears
to give better coverage than the
old one, but we won't know for
students use it and
see how it works",

Inidescribing the new program
Deck‘ said, “A student whose par-
ents have a Blue Cross policy that

' includes him is still eligible and
is encouragedito sign up for the .
'new student policy, which can
A be considered supplemental to

that of his parents.”

He also explained that stu-
dents have a false impression
that dorm students are required

to have student health insur-
made  

lance. "We have ‘positive enroll-

ment‘ with the invoices. The in-

surance —charge is included in
the tuition fee. which automatic-
ally enrolls students in the pro-
gram. If they don't want it. they
can waive it when they pay their
invoices.“

Deck listed the_following year-
ly rates. effective August 28.
which are applicable to both
students and employees: single
student——$56.16; student with de-
pendents—$1_53.60;single employ-
ee—$170.28; and employee with

 

-   Siuclenis Oiierecl New llnsu

dependents—$499.64.

He pointed out that ‘any stu-
dent. undergraduate or graduate.
who is also a University employ-
ee. should sign up for the stu-
dent rate because he still gets
the same coverage. and
cheaper. especially if he‘s mar-
ried. '

LAND DECK.

Accordingito Deck. the new I
policy gives every insured stu-

dent the option of either going
to a private physician and being
reimbursed $5.00 ‘plus 80 percent
of anything over $5.00 by the in-
surance company for the physi-

cians fee. or going to the Health

Center. .
He said, “This forms an _in-
centive to go to the Student

it's

   

and not percentage payment for
service. By using the Health
Center, a student doesn’t have to
pay’ any money, as long as
his insurance covers his problem.

"If students want their
spouses and dependents enrolled.
they must go to the Health Cen-
ter to meet with Blue Cross and
arrange for family coverage.

"My only criticismlof the new

' student health insurance plan is

that bills resulting from inter-

X collegiate athletics weireexclud-

ed‘. which I think is grossly im-"
proper and unfair to athletes.

"The reason Blue Cross gave.
fornot including it is that they
had never done it in the past.
My principal objective in. the
future is to get this exclusion
eliminated." Deck said. I

Wolicki said. "Thenew pro-

that the American colonists viewed the Stamp Act—as intolerable. Since
the__f.ee is usedto. support _the student activitiesprogram, many stu-
dents feel that they receiveno benefit from it. ‘

They are mistaken, ‘however. If a University is to provide a
quality education, it must provide both academic and social instruc-
tion._ The_.University ‘is a microcosm of the world and it should
provide, students with: the opportunity to learn to cope with the prob-
lems which they will encounter later as active citizens.

. Under theepresent system, with students controlling their own
funds,.w_e can take part in a vital learning experience. In the Repub-
lic.Plato asked, “Who should govern?” This broad, complex question
could only be dealt with by Plato in theoretical models.

1 .. Pitt students can attempt to answer this question by more prac-
ticalfmethods. They can take an active part in structuring a consti-
tuti n, in defining the roles and functions of those who govern, and
in_ins,uring a stable and responsible government. ’ I

If  __ 

by RON BROWN
Staff Columnist

Talk to anyone who's done a lot

of campaigning this year and—they'll

agree that it seems like a_ century
since the first vote count rolled
in from the New Hampshire pri-
mary of early March. Late win-
ter. spring. summer, and now
early autumn of 1972, a handful
of months that seem to hold with-
in them all the experiences of a
lifetime. And quite a lot has hap-

pened in these past six months‘

to‘ make that span of time seem
so drawn out.

An _ outspoken. out-financed
longshot, “backed by little more
than the legwork and spare change
of a new breed of politicians, has
captured the Democratic presi-

tdent-i.al..nomination. Some of the ~

most democratic” and open pro-
ceedings --in American pd‘litic’al

"history unfolded‘ at‘the -first"of«
_ two national conventions, in_:Mii- .

ami. A less thanpopular incum-
bent president has jockeyed him-
self into.an extravagant 26 point
lead over his
public opinion polls.

And _quite a lot has happened
to that hard-working,
organized, efficient and exuber-
ant enterprise that was the Mc-
Govern campaign, in full swing
onlyﬁtwo or three months back.

_ Co,-ordination of campaign ac-
tivities has faltered, in some
cases critically. Brochures and
bumper stickers have become
as scarce as Wendell Wilkie but-
tons, and volunteers seem to be
dropping off like flies.

Many fingers of blamehave
been pointed at the candidate
himself. He's got poor judgment.
he’s beginning to hedge. to
double—talk. to appease the

‘Daleys and the union bosses. He‘s
those
politicians. '
The Eagleton affair has undoubt-
edly become the largest skeleton
in George l\/IcGovern’s closet of
campaign fiascosh Yet who can
criticize him for not anticipating
the fireworks caused by public
disclosure of Tom Eagleton‘s his-
tory of mental illness or=for the
difficult decision made to select
a new running mate in hopes of
making the central campaign issue
Nixon's performance in the White
House and not Eagleton’s perform-
ance on the psychiatrist’s couch.
fy A1’ look at the campaign from

.3:--i..W-ashington headquarters down

.V.§to;.._  neighborhood‘ voting dist-

rict“ suggests that the buck stops
t'ar short of George McGovern‘s
desk.

The national- staff of the McGov-
ern-Shriver campaign has become
a multi-headed dragon, each
head having a one-track political

mind of its own.’ Gary Hart. Frank -

Mankiewicz, Larry O’Brien & Co.
are bogged down in a more com-
petitive struggle for control than
the fourteen presidential hope-
fuls who entered the Florida pri-
mary. ‘

Words of advice from experi-

enced workers in local McGov-»

ern offices fall on deaf ears,
while talk about a very “decen-
tralized” campaign operation is
--__a-ssug-argciiated way of-’,t¢-‘lling the

' "lircali oiganizers that tliey"ll..h‘5Vé"‘

McGovern needs to make any

port until the candidate comes
around to endorsing their per-
sonal platform to the tune of 95
or 100 percent.

“He hasn't spoken out on abor-
tion, or he’s not emphasizing
equal rights as much as he should
be,” they say. “And can you be-

cooperate with those graft-ridden,
old-time hack Democrats?’ I’ll

Nixon has managed to fool this

‘American. Simply because the
McGovern message is not com-
ing across as precisely and as fre-
quently as it used to. Nixon does-
n't seem like such a bad guy after-
all.

The sole point that McGovern
promises to stop the bombing of
Indochina is in itself a- sufficient
reason for continued support
among the idealistic left.-A Wash-
ington periodical reports that if
this country had been devastated
in the same proportions that Indo-
china has been in the past eight
years “all of Virginia would now be
bulldozed. All of New Jersey. .

better track record than that of

_ by JEFF PASEK
Chairman of Legal Awareness Committee

If this year is like last year, hundreds of Pitt students will be rob-
bed. Neither the" dormitories nor off campus housing is safe. But there
are some things that you can do to protect yourself.

' The Legal Awareness Committee of Student Government and the
Campus_Police will be working together to help students identify and
register their private property. 

Many large items already have a serial number. Stereos, type-
writers, and televisions fit into. this category. These serial numbers can
be very helpful to the police not only in tracking down. the thief, but in
returning your property to you.

For those ‘items that already have some sort of identifying num-
bers, “just fill out the card below and return it to either the Campus
Police or the Legal Awareness Committee.

’- Many other items, such as bicycles, radios, jewelry, and clocks
do not have their own serial numbers. They are much easier for the
thief to ‘dispose of‘ after the robbery, since the chances of their being

I identified is small. If these items each had identifying numbers, your
'9 chances of recovering them would be much greater. If you want to have

‘ " Jewle-lry Repairs

an identifying number‘ placed on-any of your valuables, just bring it to
the Student Union patio next Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, Sept.
11-13. Members of the Legal Awareness Committee_and the Campus
Police will be there -to mark and record special numbers on all
your property. *

Registering your valuables may not prevent you from being rob-
bed, but itwill greatly ‘improve the ‘chances that your property will be
returned. Aside from this, the best step you can take to protecting
yourself is simply locking your door. A surprising number of people
don’t even close their doors when they leave.‘ ' ’

 In the dorms, locking your door is even more important, but even-

"th'at doesn’t guarantee your safety. When you move into the_,dorms, you
are given a room key and pay a deposit for its return. But you are never
given any guarantee that‘ other keys issued to your room have been
turned in by previous tenants or that the lock has been changed to pro-
tect your privacy. —

This situation was brought home to two residents of Tower B-last
fall when they went home for Thanksgiving weekend. The door to their
room'wa‘s locked when they left and it was locked when they returned.
But in the interim, their room had been ransacked and over $500 worth
of property was stolen: The thieves were never caught and nothing
was ev_er recovered-. ' . - 1

 ' No one can_be completely safe from crime. If someone wants to
rob you, he probably can and will. But if this all sounds too‘ pessi-
mistic, it need not. Remember that most thieves steal property that
can ‘be quickly converted to cash. If you have your property marked

and the police have a record of it, it will be ‘harder for the thief to

dispose of and easier for the police _to recover and return it to you.

Fellowship Matings

The University Counseling Serv-
ice is beginning to identify and ad-
vise students seeking national fel-
lowships for graduate study next
year. The service works in close-
cooperation with the University
Committee on National and Inter— ~
national Fellowships to uncover

potential candidates.

The selection process begins in
early fall for students who are be-
ginning their senior year and who
intend to pursue graduate studies ‘
in the fall of 1973. ’

Most of the fellowships fall into
one of two classifications.

The top prestigious fellowships
such as Danforth, ‘Rhodes, and
Marshall require the endorse-

ment of the Universpy Commit- '

tee and a candidate QPA of 3.75.

Lesser known fellowships
(Richard Weaver, Coro, and NSF)
do not require a University Com-
mittee endorsement and candi-
dates need only have an overall
QPA of3.0. 9

Special fellowships are
available for minority and wom-
en students. Fellowships are also
available for studr“-ts interested
in specialized study such as law,
medicine and business. '

Any senior interested in apply-
ing for a ‘national fellowship
should make an appointment to
see Ms. Pat Roberts immediately
at the Counseling Center. room
205, Student Union.

Renovated Towers
by non GEDEKOH ‘

On Aug. 29 Chancellor Posvar ._

made his second tour of the Tow-
ers dorms to inspect the renova-
tions which have taken place this
summer. The remodeling was ini-
tiated after the Chancellor made a

surprise tour of the facilities last ._
March with Student Government -'

leaders as guides. v -

‘Over the summer 70 per cent 
of" the individual rooms, the stair-
wells, halls and elevators were: [ '

repainted and asbestos tiles were

placed on several of the floors. ‘A
Perhaps the most noteworthy ~

changes in the dorms involved the

placement of a TV lounge in ‘the;

Tower’s ‘facilities and the place-

ment of new furniture throughout. , ’

the Tower’/s lobbies. Each of the
lounges in the various dorm
houses were enclosed with glass

paneling and new furniture was..-\
’ placed in each house. ”

John Vrana, housing_.di_rector,‘. ‘
noted that these .lounge fa‘cilities-  .:
could easily be used for student“”~“

programs, thus" curtailing the
need for student organizations t_o

hold their meetings outside of the . '

dorms. -

The Student Government Board ' 
‘allocated ’ $1,200 to the Men’s 

Dorm Council for the -purchase of

a television for they Litchfield‘ 

Lounge. Vrana emphasized that

students helped make decisions in '-
the remodeling of the dorms, and. 1

noted that 20 students were em-

ployed this summer in the re- _ 

modeling program.

Chancellor Posvar voiced his _.
approval of the improved facil- ~

ities adding that “I hope these im-

provements will enhancethe spir-' ’  

it of cooperation so that ‘ vandal:
ism will be kept to a minimum.

that those courses which sounded
so interesting in thehandbook last
spring are real bummers. Or you
are one of those unfortunate fresh-
man who had to, register for all
sorts of insipid courses because
the more enticing offerings were

closed. .

Well don’t despair, there are
still openings for all students in
some of the most interesting and
innovative courses offered at

" Pitt according to administrators
in the College of Arts and Sci-

ences Advising Center.
, Some of these openings are the

- result of ‘student withdrawals,

while others are cou_rses which

Students closed out of subjects

have occurred.

Below is a brief overview of a
few of the more interesting course
offerings still available to stu-
dents. The subjects range from
life on other planets to the soci-
ology of the people of Afghanis-
tan. A far more comprehensive
list of available courses may be

Several of the courses with
openings for all students include
offerings which are usually filled

“For some -reason they were
simply overlooked by students
registering last spring,” according
to Fred Koloc, head of'the ad-
vising center.

     

   

An example of a "forgotten
course" is the once popular Eng-
lish 180, a six credit English
literature course. Another such
course is CAS 17, an introduc-
tory course on drugs taught by

professors from the pharmacy.

Earth and Planetary Science
Course on Intelligent Life in the

study seriously the possibility that
life exists elsewhere in the uni-
verse in the light of current

prerequisites for this three credit
course.

students interested in studying

the Katz award for the most inno- .

vative new course last year.

All of these courses may be
used to fulfill Distribution of
Studies requirements. and they
offer a colorful alternative to
the traditional survey courses
which have been popular in the

. past.

For Newcomers Only

Openings are still available for
freshman in 16 of the 22 Fresh-
man Studies Courses instituted
this year. Many of these courses
were not cbmpletely prepared
during freshman registration. so
that many students were unaware
of their availability." Trudi Nor-
man, head of the Freshman Stu-
dies Program. hopes that students
who were unable to register for
required courses in their pro-
posed major will find some re-
lated course among these special
offerings. ~

“For instance, prospective biol-
ogy majors who were unable to
register for Biology 1 might wish
to consider the "Freshman Studies
course on Scientific Understand-
ing,” she said.

-\-\

' by MARK RINOVATO

Senator George McGovern‘s
Pittsburgh headquarters in Oak-
land is not-the fanciest base of op-
erations you will ever see. A
desk and a chair total the furnish-
ings in most rooms. One room
contains a picnic table covered
with letters waiting to be mailed.
Campaign ‘ literature covers the
billboards and desks. while Mc-
'Govern’s more famous and dra-
matic quotes appear on pieces of
_construction paper which dec-
orate thewalls.

Despite sweltering heat. youth-
1"} ful volunteers eagerly perform
their registration and mailing
tasks. guided by the experience
and wisdom of Mrs. Molly Yard.
McGovern’s campaign director for
Western ,.»Pennsylvania. A woman
in her late forties. Mrs. Yard is a
veteran of _ many political cam-
paigns. Her‘ subordinates find her
ageless “efforts an irrspirationfm
describing her as “an amazing
woman with a IQ of at least
2000.“ An exageration. perhaps.
but the campaign activities she
hgygmapped out for the fallare far
- ' fi‘orn_simple. and promise to be a
grueling,,tedious test for McGov-
fe ernites. ’

“The main objective of this
campaign {is to find the unregis-
tered voters‘ and get them regis-
tered. That isthe key to victory
in November,” Mrs. Yard stated
emphatically. , ' I -

l

' She "plans to do this by putting l~

into operation the most extensive
and thorough voter registration
drive in history. The wheels have
already been set in motion. Let-

: ters-are being mailed ‘to homes

, all across Western Pennsylvania
requesting small contributions
for the upcoming presidential
e3.§3tion. This is part of McGov-
erii's national 25 million dollar
mailing plea. an effort designed to
finance his campaign with mil-
lions of small contributions. In
this fashion, he hopes to keep po-
litical» debts at-a minimum. The
letters also stressvolunteer help
and voter registration.

Distribution of leaflets merely
prefaces the real drive for regis-

ized speeches, campaigners will
approach people in their homes

to gauge the sentiment of area‘

voters. This will give McGovern
a good idea of where he stands

\with the voters in this area. The

public will also be tested on its
sensitivity to and awareness of

. the issues inthis campaign. ‘Most

importantly. the door to door
campaign will give McGovern
Headquarters an up to date street

will make it possible to tap into

Govern strength and put the pres- ,

sure on by phone and by mail to
see that these potential support-
ers register. As Mrs. Yard point-
ed out: 2

"By getting the names and num-

bers of theseunregistered voters.

we can call to remind them of the
field registration day set for Sep-
tember and October. We will even
go fo far as to off_er them rides to
the registration ‘sites if that is
necessary." ,

Field registration represents
an added dimension torthe,Mc-
Govern campaign. Registration
booths will be set up at high
schools, colleges, and even shop-
ping malls in hopes of attracting
large numbers of unregistered
voters with the easy availability
of suchya system. McGovernitesp
will man the booths every Wed-
nesday night and Saturday morn-
ing from Sept. 7 to Oct. 7.

The McGovern scheme includ-
es _not only convenient access to
places of registration but also
provides a way to quicken the
pace of the registration process.
Mrs. Yardelaborates:

"Canvassers will also carry
with them registration forms to
distribute to the unregistered vot-
ers. ‘They can fill these forms
out at borne. bring them to any
field registration site. and be
sworn in within 20 seconds . . . .
People always say that they in-
tend to register.‘ but unless you
keep after them somehow they
manage to forget."

Campaigners intend to start
canvassing the poor neighbor-
hoods first because they feel these
areas hold the largest percentage
of pro—McGovern sentiment.

This type of grassroots cam-
paign will require more than just
organization. McGovern Head-
quarters will need plenty of vol-
unteer work and money to suc-
cessfully carry out its campaign
plans. Supporters of Hubert
Humphrey could play a big part
in volunteer work and in wooing
labor leaders to contribute cash
to McGovern’s campaign. When
asked what the response of Hum-

phrey people has been like so .

far, Mrs. Yard replied:

"We‘ve had Humphrey support-
ers in here offering their help. .In

be. Will labor forces endorse Sen-

of the top labor leaders in West-

McGovern Headquarters to dis-

was quite confident after
meeting that most labor people

favored McGovern. She believes ‘

RESIGNATION \

The Office of Student Affairs
announced the resignation of Dr.
.Konnilyn Feig, director of Spe-
cial Programs. Dr. Feig has ac-
cepted a- position as the Dean of
the College of Liberal Arts at the
University of Maine, Portland-
Gorham. ‘ ‘

Dr. Alfred MOye', Dean or Stu-

dent Affairs, stated, "Dr. Feig is.

one of the most creative people
I’ve ever met and has done an ex-
cellent job in terms of program-
ming.

When asked about her most sat-
isfying programs during her stay
at the University, Dr. Feig stated.
‘‘I’ve never beenlsatisfied with
anything. There is nothing that
we’ve done that we-couldn‘t hav
done better.” ‘ »

ACTIVITIES FEE
REFERENDUM ,
Student Government President
Tom Bailey stated that there may
be areferendum'on the Student

Activities Fee in January. 1973.-

due to the growing concern of leg-
islators regarding its legality-

“To get it passed_._ we will need
public relations work to show all
what the fee provides," Bailey
said in his report.

Until now the activities fee has

‘ been collected by Student Govern-
ment with students having no -

voice in the matter. Legislators
areconcerned as to whether‘ this
is constitutional. If the students
vote to continue the fee, much of
the doubt would be erased.

NEW STUDENT UNION?

A student task force along with
the Office of ‘Student Affairs will
serve as the first step in planning
a new student union facility.

Bill Markus, spokesman for Stu-
dent Union plans from the Office
of Student Affairs, said, “With
the present Student Government
administration there has been

'considerable_ ,intereZst,;.in.,.. the pI'e-,,..'

'seI‘l't=”‘Student"UnifO'rI"' facility with
its lack ofsufficient space for,
programs sands?‘ a"ctiv-ities"-'7and i7tS§* 

inadequacy.

“The idea of a new Student Un-
ion was discussed at the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
meetings with ’the Chancellor.
Dr.-» Alfred Moye, Dean of Student
Affairs, expressed his concern
with the present facility’s inade-
quaey.

“A student Union isn’t a high
priority for the building scheme
of the administration. But per-
haps, with the work of the task
force the administration can at
least shift its priorities and put
the Student Union high on its list.”

ARTS FESTIVAL

Pittsburghers produced more
than smog and sewage and the
Three Rivers Arts Festival was
living proof. The creations of over
500 artists were on exhibit. at the
cultural event.

_ ‘The annual spring production

was presented out of doors at the

I » Gateway Center Plazas with sculp-

tures placed on the grounds and
paintings on the plaza walkways
under gaily painted green and gold
pavilions. 4

In addition to visual arts, per-

forming arts were included night- _

ly with presentations from the
Pittsburgh Symphony, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Jazz Ensem-

ble, the Lovelace "'Marionetterb

Theater and many others.

Scenes of Pittsburgh’s activ-
itiesyincl-uded sketches of hill-
sides, streets, and news events
like the Skybus Hearing and Yah-
lonski. Trials.

In the past_12 years, exhibits
have been designed for the older
art viewer...However, this year
children were also entertained at
the festival. Playground equip-
ment was made from recycled
material, old tires, railroad ties,
cable reels and many items from
junk yards.

TERM. 3 PAPERBILL
State Senators W. E. Fleming
and J. Reibman introduced S.
1405, a bill which would make the
selling of dissertations, thesis
and- term papers a misdemeanor
in the state of Pennsylvania.

William Cromer. a memberof
Senator Fleming’s staff, stated
that the wording of the bill takes
care -of the wholesaler as well as
the retail dealer in term papers.

The bill, which reads in part,‘

“No person shall Sell or offer for
distribution in the Commonwealth
any aSsiStance,_ research, etc.
used to fulfill academic require-
ments . . .” will prevent out of
state firms from Sharing their
wares with firms in Pennsylvania,
according to Cromer. I

A spokesman for Write On, a

stated that the bill would not ef-
fect their operation.

NEW DRUG LAW

The Controlled Substance Drug,

Device and Cosmetic Acts of 1972
which took effect in Pennsylvania
June 14 makes possession and
use of marijuana or hashish a
misdemeanor. This law replaces
the Drug, Device, and Cosmetic
Act of — Sept. - 26, 1962, which
classified such an offense as a fe-
lony.

The law states that amounts of
marijuana weighing under 30
grams‘ or hashish weighing under
eight grams will be considered-...a
“small amount.”

The maximum penalty_for pos-
session or transfer without pay-
ment of a “small amount” of
these drugs is 30 days in jail or
$500 fine.

Possession or transfer without

payment of greater amounts of

1 these drugs is still a misdemean-

or with a maximum penalty "Of one

Traffiking in large amounts of.

these drugs can lead to 15 years in - ‘
prison or a fine or acquarter of a ‘

sidered a felony.

‘Under thisjnew law a first of-

fender may plead guilty and be ‘
placed on probation for a period ‘ '

not exceeding the maximum time
of imprisonment. '

When the probation is ful-'

filled, the court must discharge

tion of guilty. ,-

  Pittsburgh: The Pinacle I of

by ANDREW J.‘ SOPKO
Arts Editor

As the final weeks of the sum-
mer wane into the smog. we
Pittsburghers find ourselves open-
ing our newspapers once again
as we participate in the annual
ritual of learning just when to
expect the summer cultural slum-
ber of our beloved metropolis to
be shaken off.

We begin circling dates on the
calendar lest certain cultural
events be forgotten in the crush
of everyday activities,.as we rest
assured that art has returned
to our midst until our ennui once
again incites us to begin thinking
about vacation time (an event
which usually accompanies the
spring thaw.)

Season ticket holders and other
such culture vultures devour
the season’s promotional litera-
ture describing not only artists
but more importantly, the re-
spective events themselves, as '
shouts of joy and agony fill the
air in response to the prospects of
the new season. r’

And what are the prospects of
the upcoming season? Are we any
less provincial than we were ten
years ago in our approach to the
arts in Pittsburgh? One fears that
a negative answer is the only
-truthful one in this quandry and
there are certainly a panoply of
reasons for such a response.

Culturally, our city is still
very young_and its present artist-
ic “manifestations” certainly
make that fact quite clear. It is
no secret that our city’s environ-
ment has been anything but con-
ducive to the arts. (Need we
mention how two of the world’s
great art collections were lost
because our native philanthropists
found the populace unworthy of
their treasures?)

Many years have passed and we
still do not have a really serious-
museum nor a serious theatre nor
a serious opera company. For

_ many years we did not even have

I}?
"lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllIlllllllIllllllllllllllIllllIIlllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllllllllllll l

a serious orchestra; it was only
with the appearance of Dr. Stein-
berg that our orchestra came of
age. ' ' '
' Pittsburgh provincialism is
rooted in a public which loves
that which is known and de-
tests that which is unknown. This.
however, does notmean to say
that we have no use for the con-
temporary idiom in contrast to
the tested virtues of older artis-
tic creations (which appeal. like
some finely aged wine), to" our
“civilized” senses; ,_

We sit back and demand that
the familiar and only the familiar
(whether Bach or Bartok) be placed
before. us. In doing so, we have
caused the stagnation of our.artis-

pity out of it.

While the “three B’s" shall
ever haunt us in the concert
hall (and rightly so), we have
ignored Nielsen, Vaugahn Wil-
liams, and a host of other com-
posers. Token contemporary
works liberally decorate this sea-
on’s symphony series as do the
old warhorses, but what of these
many works which have proven
their worth in the truly great cul-
tural centers of the world?

That which is generally con-
sidered “obscure” by Pittsburgh
standards is usuallv “common
knowledge” beyond our private
bastion of culture. Quite frankly,

T our symphony programs have

certainly been less than imagin-
ative and we should be very con-
cerned.

And what of our opera? Does
not a glance at this season’s pro-
ductions almost drive one to de-
spair? Have we not had Carmen

and Toscavand Butterfly ad_naus-.

earn in the past years? Even the
selection of Dutchman shows that
the company has taken the easy
way out as far as Wagnerian
musical drama is concerned (and
who could really blame them
after last season’s Wagnerian
fiasco?)

The greatest and most intoler-
able fallacy of all stems from
those who are successfully de-
luding the public by making it
believe that Heinz Hall has ap-
peared on the scene as the cul-
tural panacea for this city’s
artistic ills. Gold’ leaf and crys-

tal do much to obscure the prob- .

lem that underlies our dilemma.

Being seen at Heinz these ‘days
is evidently considered tres chic.
yet the Carnegie Music Hall
is practically empty for our cham-
bermusic society’s concert series.

Even less alluring in our mem-
ory are the days when the Mosque
was our city’s cultural center. At
the Mosque, we were all disturbed
when those very old seats would

creak,, and rightly so, for the
noise marred the performances.
We no longer need worry about
the seats’ creaking at Heinz Hall.
nor do many of us care to worry
about when we arrive late and
leave early.

We have instead concerned our-
selves this past inaugural sea-
son with wondering just when
the Hall’s legal libation of spirits
would begin as we stood in the
foyers sipping our exorbitantly
priced soft drinks at the interval.

Misplaced values also have
their part in the struggle for a
healthy cultural situation. We
cannot help but recall a gentleman
who felt that the opening of
Heinz Hall meant that many peo-
ple would “dress up more" (he
was evidently‘ there to be seen
and not to listen). Much of this

_may seem petty but it is this

very pettiness in both taste and
manners which has become the
gauche trademark of Pittsburgh
audiences.

While performances have im-
proved, the general environment
has not. Must we be so tragically
provincial in our manners as well
as in our tastes?

Fortunately, the picture of this
city’s cultural dilemma is not
completely devoid of favorable
developments. Our universities, our
new ballet company, and the
ever popular Pittsburgh Opera
Workshop have all shown that
new and and excitingthings can in-
deed grow and perhaps even ma-
ture in our somewhat staid sit-
ution.

Especially commendable has
been Pitt’s music department’s
series of concerts and recitals
which have certainly put the new
and “little known” before the
public.

Our principal concern here has
been that of our city's musical
life and the public’s general re-
action to it. But.the problem does
not end in the musical realm for
it is found just as easily in the

by SHARON SEXTON

. The University Counseling Center, in an effort to expand services which it pro-
vides‘ to the university community, will initiate three new counseling programs this
ear.

S One of the Center’s projects is the establishment of a network of alumni volun-
teers to work as resource people for Pitt undergraduates. Dr. Robert Gallagher, di-
',‘_rector of‘ the’ Center explains, “In addition to speaking with Pitt students about their
‘jobs and the problems they face, these alumni could be extremely helpful in plac-
ing Pitt graduating seniors since jobs are often obtained as a result of personal con-
Iitacts.” -

i  Expecting a large increase in the number of VietNam Veterans attending Pitt
his year, the center has hired Dr. Joseph Hinton, a black psychologist from the Uni-
ersity of Illiiidis to work as a liason between the vets and the Counseling Center.
_- .‘The Counseling Center expects to make every effort to reach out to the veterans,
”Vi’etNam veterans in particular, and aid them in solving the special problems they

iillencounter on a personal and vocational level,” said Gallagher.

.',.'The Counseling Center is _also making plans to establish a “peer-to—peer” Coun-
eling program. The program will probablytake the form of a student community
rop-in center and will involve a hot-line manned by student volunteers.

 In addition to these new programs the Counseling Center will continue to offer

 

Counseling Center Initiates New Programs

services it has offered in the past.

The center provides free help to any student, faculty or staff member with per-' '

sonal, vocational or academic problems. The center provides this help in the form of
individual or group counseling and encounter groups.

Gallagher says that the counselors help students with problems ranging from
homesickness, pre-marital fears, post abortion guilt feelings and problems with room-
mates to graduate school and fellowship advice.

The Center also offers a variety of career planning services. Individual career
counseling, the facilities of the Career Library, the Career Newsletter, the Alumni
Counseling Service, graduate study counseling and fellowship and scholarship infor-
mation are all services which Pitt students are encouraged to use.

In addition, the Center will sponsor a Career Seminar Series October 2 - 5. Be-
tween 1 and 4 p.m., professionals from a range of fields including law, medicine and
communications will be in the Student Union Ballroom to talk informally with stu-
dents about their particularcareers.

While counseling is usually done by appointment, provision is made for anyone
requesting to see a counselor at once. When the situation does not require immediate
consultation an appointment can be arranged either in person (205 S.U.) or by tele-
phone (x7265). The center is open from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. ,Monday through Friday, and
at other times by special arrangement.

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or services
offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments. These are
textbooks new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All buying for these
areas is premised on three basic principles. First the item must be required
for a given course or programv of the University. Items of this type a't/{ell
naturally the textbooks, used books, and paperbacks. Second, trade depart-
ment items are made available that are necessary to supplement and com- "
plement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic signifi-
cance of the University. Third, supply department on the lower floor has
supply items for your every need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hun-
dreds of other items. Fourth, sundries department has all the professional t
items, engineering supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the
availability of many items extremely professional.

Newly published BOOKS OF GENERAL INTEREST, both hard cover and
paperback are on the street floor. More than 16,000 paperback‘ and 12,000
cloth titles are displayed in separate sections by subject catagories. Period-
icals and JOURNALS (scholarly, literary, professional, and technical) are '
displayed in this area.

  No ‘Sexxess' Story

mocks society’s obsession with
sexual fantasies and mechanical
solutions to sexual problems.

But the rest of the“ skits rate
only as feeble attempts to satir-
ize such genres as TV panel
shows, medieval romances, and ’
science fiction monster movies.
The mad doctor in the latter is
intent upon measuring just how
large the human breast can be-
come after a series_of intensive
silocon treatments. The monster,
a giant teat, escapes and terror-

Qyizes the local environs.

The mad doctor skit illustrates
the problem which plagues the
entire film. One can not deny that
Allen’s initial ideas are ingenious,
but he consistently fails to de-
velop them into viable 20 minute
skit.

The expanded product inevit-
ably appears shallow and inept
and the film as a whole comes‘
out looking like a hastily produc-
ed freshman orientation film at

Pennsy Prep. The laughter which
fills the theater in the begin-
ning of each of the six skits all
too rapidly dissolves into a few
scattered chuckles. _

In every instance a hilarious
idea turns sour for one reason
or another and each skit de-
generates into boredom. Per-
haps in the rush to release the
movie before the book loses its
notoriety. Allen simply did not
spend enough time developing
his ideas to their fullest.-

Allen has become known as
master of f‘switcher0o comedy,”
prompting many critics to refer

to him as Allen Woody. And in-"

Everything You Always Wanted-
to Know About Sex But Were
Afraid to Ask Allen comandeers
one of his grandest switcheroos.
He succeeds in altering.Reuben’s
meaningful though irreverent
dialogue into meaningless tripe,
launching his first failure in a
long series of successes. ‘

Lately you probably have seen or heard much about ROTC. But
how much do you know about the ROTC program and the advan-

employer, a parentor a student? . . . HERE ARE THE FACTS:

SCHOLARSHIP AID: During school year
1971-72. approximately 6,500 students across the

T nation attended college on Army ROTC Schol-
arships. At Pitt one out of every five Army_
‘ROTC Cadets held ROTC Scholarships. during

the ‘past school year. These scholarships paid
their tuition. textbooks. .and all other relatet-l

educational expenses.

FINANCIAL A|D£ Scholarship recipients
receive a $100 per month (tax freei subsistance
allowance. Non—scholarship student also receive
a $100 per month allowance during the ROTC
advance course. normally the last two years of
couege. I

. DRAFT DEFERMENT: Enrollment in
ROTC makes you eligible for immediate defer-
ment. upon request. This can provide you with
the assurance that your college education. to
include graduate study. will not be interrupt-

Drug Overdose Claims
‘Association’ Member

by BARBARA GERAUD

Brian Cole, the bass player for the Association. died Aug. 2. of a,
combination of drugs causing an overdose.

While not yet addicted he had become one who let drugs‘ begin

« to rule his‘ life. The rest of the group tried to help him, but they

couldn’t force anything (Brian was a stubborn one) so another bas-
sist joined the group, leaving Brian to concentrate on his singing.

More a poet than a songwriter, Brian only composed two songs for
the group’s ten album's—“I.Am Up for Europe” and ‘,‘Traveler’s Guide
\(Spanish Flyer).” But his bass voice was an extra asset to a group
full of tenors and baritones, and he could easily make the transition
from singing a slow ballad like “Remember” to wailing out one like
“Movin’.” A

He loved puns and double entendres and wrote a great deal of the
group‘s on—stage patter. An inveterate reader. he could talk at length
on any subject, from theosophy to baseball, music to poker odds. sex
to vegetables.

But he tended to go overboard at times. He often said that he was
afraid of nothing, that he was the master of his destiny, that he con-
trolled himself. When I knew him, he took great pride in saying he was
“above” drugs; he could get high withoutthem.

Yet, for all his intelligence, he let himself get hooked into the drug
cycle. It proved his undoing. And unfortunately. it cost him his life. He

will be missed—certainly«.not as much as Hendrixlor Joplin .or‘t- l.D.uane>l.

Allman,, for he was not that well known-—but by those of us who did
know and care about him.

‘Levelheaded’ appraisal cited

Book Explores Biomedical Ethics

by BOB GEDEKOH

, THE BIOCRATS by Gerald Leach
356 pages, Penquin Books, Inc.
(McGraw Hill), $1.95

In recent years the public has
been bombarded with announce-
ments of incredible health care
improvements and amazing new
medical techniques which sup-
posedly will prolong life. Scarcely
a magazine or newspaper hits the
stands without some reference to
dramatic transplant operations,
prospective cancer cures, chemi-
cal means for preventing senil-
ity, radical cures for mental ill-
nesses and -fantastic (and some-

' what threatening) genetic control

programs. _ I   _
But while scientists and physi-
cians mourn the irresponsibility
of the media reporters who over-
exaggerate experimental results,
the same over zealous reporters

continue to search for new "dis-'

coveries” to bring to the attention
of naive lay readers.

It is -small wonder that the pub-
lie is thoroughly confused about
the state of modern health care.
The gap between promise and
reality continues to widen, as
people who expect to deliver their
next child from a glass tube dis-
cover that there is still no cure
for the common cold.

One of the few authors who has
repeatedly explored the health

care situation for laymen in a re-
sponsible fashion has just pub-
lished a new book titled The Bio-
crats. Gerald Leach, a well known
English free lance science writer
and correspondent for the British
Broadcasting System, prudently
examines some of the most im-
portant health care issues facing
20th century man in the light of
realistic appraisals of recent
scientific developments.

Leach concludes that we should
begin to utilize some of the health
care resources available to us at
this time before we expend a
great deal of energy and money

developing radical and expensive ’

new techniques.

In successive chapters he ex-
plores areas such as birth and
population control, selective gen-
etics for humans, fetal medicine,
birth defects, possible manipula-
tions of the nervous system, life
on machines and transplants. In
each instance he attempts to
make quantitative analyses of
the ‘economic and humanistic
benefits of each area of research.

His final chapter on priorities
may seem overtly cold blooded,

‘but such economic considerations

must be used to decide which
areas of medical research de-

serve to receive a large portion‘

of the human resources available
for health care.

Leach maintains that we should

make decisions in such a way as '

to improve the lives of as many
human beings as possible. He in-
dicates that often the highly pub-
licized "modern medical mir-
acles” reap terrible tolls in hu-
man misery and deplete value-
able hospital and personnel re-
sources which might be put to
better use on less dramatic but
more pressing problems.

He cites an instance in the Na-
tional Heart Hospital of England
where no operations were per-
formed for a week because a
heart transplant patient could_not
be removed from the sterile op-
erating areas. Normally ten life
sustaining cardiac operations
would have been performed’ in the‘
same arena in an equal period of
time.

Leach discusses patients who »

have chosen to die rather thanfs--ta».-».“—

continue the frustrations of living "

on life sustaining machines or

diets, and questions the ethics of f‘

saving the life of a severely de-
fective infant only to return him to
parents who are ill-equipped emo-
tionally and financially to offer
the special care such a child re-
quires. .

He does not take a radical posi-
tion demanding legalized euthana-
sia or sterilization, but he does
urge modern societies to take re-
sponsible stands on abortion and
to provide birth control materials
freely to those who need them.

Leach also favors intensive re-'
search into preventative genetics
as he cautiously explores the peas‘;
sibility that the human race,rria’y

force itself to extinction through gut

aggressive eugenic programs.

Leach avoids sensationalism
through most of The Biocrats,
with the exception of the picture
of the living human fetus lying in
a glass bowl on the cover of the
book.

Instead he favors a level head- "

ed. economic approach to deci-
sion making which is more:like--

ly to provoke deep thought in the "

reader than amazement or panic.
The book certainly does not offer
the thrills of Brave New World,
but it should help lay readers un-
derstand the important problems

they had to work for many years
.to get .the public to realize they
would conquer the world.

After eight years of roaming

Brian the manager convinced

.ing sweet and clean and innocent

and America took the four mop-

, tops to her‘ collective bosom (3,-
000 miles worth)!

And there were record sales
and public" appearances, and the
big bad moneyman moved in to
give us _Beatle T-shirts and note-
books. and cuddly toys (to gratify
latent urges in the pre-pubescent
teenyboppers who .need_ some-

' thing to hold when they sleep but
don’t know what). I

Of course, there was Beatle
hair, which caused such a great
breakdown__in the moral fiber of
the country and the world. And the

And the group p1ayed‘their mu-

screaming millionswho paid un-
heard—of prices to sit in Shea Sta-
dium and watch little stick fig-
ures prancing around out on sec-
ond base. '

But soon, the beautiful bubble
of Beatlemania had to break.
First, there was no more tour-
ing, then, no more movies. Then
John was bigger than Christ. And
records came out less frequently
and were more difficult to" com-
prehend. Acid ruled Beatle brains
and after the death of Brian Ep-
stein, Allan Klein’s greed for
moneyruled everything. And the
world drifted aimlessly, awaiting
the coming of a new Saviour, or; a
rebirth of the old. '

Paul died, and was resurrected.
John found Yoko in an art gallery
and breathed for her, transform-
ed himself into one of Two Virgins

entirely in white to show his pur-
ity. (A Beatle?) Ringo made Can-
dy.

Geroge got busted and became
a mystic, finding God in the gourd
of his sitar.’ Paul found super-
groupie—.Linda (the house mother .
of the Fillmore East) and made

"an honest woman .out of her, then
brought her family in ‘to further
complicate the Beatle finances
and partnership. For thus it was
written, “She shall leave her
father’s house and cleave‘ only
unto her husband.” (Poor Linda.
Poor'Paul.) ' V

The group died, and,the individ-
uals went their separate _ways.
“The dream is over,” John said.
So pretty Pauland his whole‘fami-
ly made some albums together,
and John and Yoko made some al-
bums together_and with every-
body else.

George played with anybody
who asked him to and made one
super album with all his friends. ‘
Ringo turned into a country and , _

ever
wherein Stephen Stills and Richie
Furay ‘met Neil Young in his
hearse, this first of the Western
supergroups endured a short and
stormy life. For there were ego ,
conflicts, during which the band
found itself strugling for‘ exis-
tence. Bu’ time were too hard,
and after many tribulations. the
Buffalo died. '

Desh. so George was forced to go
it alone. with a little help from
Ringo and others. Paul was busy
with Wings and reverting back to
zoot-suits, slicked-back hair and
baggy pants with six-foot watch
fobs.

While John vainly tried to get

involved in any political contro-
versy that came along merely to
proveyhe was relevant. the world
still looked for good music and no
ego trips. And they waited some
more.

But meanwhile, back on the

WesttCoast was born also a‘revi-
val of good music, from Beach

Papas to Mojo Men. It was a time
_of peace and love and sharing —

 PN Sports Page

In the past, the Pitt News Sports Section have not been
lacking of quality. It will be the job of the present staff to first
continue that»,policy as well as doing additional things to make
the sports more meaningful for all.

For the coverage of the varsity sports, the Pitt News Sports
will again be the place to look. There will be added attention
placed on the more minor sports, however. From football to
Gymnastics Pitt News will cover them all. This year, intramural
‘sports will receive the -best coverage ever.

Intramural sports attract a large amount of the student
population and for this reason the student will be able to read

' about himself in the sports pages, for sure.

* With the cooperation of Loe Bemis’ office and better re-
cording by the IM- teams themselves, Sports will print scores,
averages, standings, game stories, IM -features, all-star selec-
'tions, and most valuable player choices in the more promi-
nent IM sports. _, .

Of course, this will include women’s sports, club teams,
and otther activities where coverage was nill in the past. _

* Student submitted questions will be asked of anyone in
the athletic department. Both the full question, including the
identity of the questioneer, will be printed in every issue. A
question, on a student’s behalf, will be asked by our staff.
Hopefully, a lot of weekly questions will pop up at our office

'‘''_‘-,at _4l7 Student Union. If there are more than one, the best

question will be chosen by the Editor. Question may also be
mailed to the same address. /

Also, worthwhile contributions will be accepted by the of-
fice from students. We will welcome Letters to the Sports Edi-
tor. There is always room on our staff to anyone who thinks
they might desire to write for the sports department. 0

' \

. Every sports writergw-ill be free to express his or her own
opinion _in editorial form, provided the opinion is timely and
interesting to the reader. We are going to keep trash off. our
pages. You will be able to expect quality. ’

While everyone will be free to ‘express, the sports pages
will not be a ‘hatchet staff’—that is, you won’t find any wild,
untrue, or emotional type writing where a person’s job will
be demanded etc. without definate. proof. We will not shy

 sgway from contraversity, however. Be assured of that. We, the

writers, will have to remember that we are not professional
sportswriters where a story could lead to the sale of many
newspapers. We don’t sell our paper. .

V If the reader finds something not to his liking in our, pages,
come see us inthe office and suggest ideas.  A

Remember, the Pitt News is a student newspaper and will
work hard to please the student. .

All/vlacha Al ome
As, Buc Catcher

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

Ex—Panther mitter Ken Macha has found a permanent home with
the Pittsburgh Pirates behind home plate.

During his collegiate career Macha played outfield and last sea-
son he manned first base. The Pirates. however. chose to employ the
versatile player as a catcher. a position he hasn't played in three years.

"The Pirates liked my arm and my movements." he-stated.."Thev
thought I was wasting my skills at first base." ‘i

_Even though Macha has changed defensive positions, he still re-
mains consistent at the plate.

Since being drafted by the Bucs in the middle of June, Macha has _

been clobbering minor league pitching with the same ease that he
demonstrated during his years as a Panther.

_ Over the summer the righthander rocked opposing pitchers for
eight home runs and 40 RBI’s. He also maintained
his .300 average that he had during his final season
with Pitt. ' I

Macha was originally sent to Niagra Falls after
being drafted, but the Pirate club was so impressed
by hisyperformance that they very quickly placed’  ’
him with the Class A League at Salem. -

“Ken is doing really well," commented his base-‘
ball coach at Pitt. Bob Lewis. "I thought he would
do well but I didn’t think it would happen s0.quick-
ly with Ken. ‘

H c "I thought the pitching might catch him for awhile but it hasn‘t.-
He’s been able to.hit the pitching well.”

The switch to Salem proved to be beneficial to both Macha and
the Salem club. Before his arrival half way through the season, Salem
was eight and one half games out of first place. _ A

The second half of the season was an entirely different story.

With the additional help from Macha on both offense and defense,
Salem took Birlington two out of three games to become the cham-

  

(pions of the Carolina League.

The Pirates have further honored Macha. by asking him to partici-
pate in the Instructional League during the fall. The League will play
in Bradenton, Fla.. starting Sept. 18 and continuing for two months.

Although Macha has one more term at ‘Pitt to complete his ma-
jor in engineering, it is expected that he will be spending the next
two months playing ball and completing his education at some later
date.

ive Me A Head With Hair

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

If Swami Pandarasnnadhi had been born in 1949,
the year of his death, and proved to have fine ath-
lete potential, he might never have had the oppor-
tunity to either be a fine collegiate or pro athlete.

It would have depended. ‘

r, when -Swami died his hair measured at
theastronomical length of 26feet. _ ‘- V

If Swami were an incoming
freshman'football player at Syra-
cuse or North Carolina Universi-
ties,‘ to name a few, all his hair, no
matter the reason for growing it
so long, would be shad off. No
matter if he was a pint sized half— 
back with blazing speed or a 6’6 , 250 pound line-

   

man with the quickness of an antelope, his hair .

would have to go in order for him to get his chance.

If Swami would have had the makings of a fine‘

baseball player, he would have had trouble making
it with the Cincinnati Reds of the National‘Baseball
League. Manager Spanky Anderson believes that
hitting homeruns and long hair don’t go together
like soup and a sandwich.

If Swami would have had reported to the train-

ing camp of the Philadelphia Eagles football team, .

he probably would have been cut the next day. Eddie
Khayat, who coaches the ‘Eagles, doesn’t believe
that “long hairs” can play football. Swami might

V have made it with the Oakland Athletics baseball

team, which offered a traveling circus of hair, even
down to manager Dick Williams. Owner Charley
Finley, who has done stranger things, offered mon-
ey to players that possessed long hair. Swami Pan-
Pandarasnnadhi would have made a ton. For Swami
it would have depended on the team, the coach, the‘
system. '

In fact, as late as last year, Swami, who chose’
monastery life in India instead, would not have been
able to play on the Pitt football team.

Granted, 26 feet of protien_is a lot -to tuck un-
der a football helmet. It is a lot of frizz to corral
with a head band. It’s a lot of strands to hide under
a wrestling helmet. But, most people with so called
long hair—less than 26 feet—grow it either slightly‘
above the shoulders or just below the ‘ears. Yet,

~. there are a lot of coaches, commissioners, ‘and

. years coming as well.

desires. Could this be discrimination?

Cursed has been the athlete who grows hair for
either appearance or identification and has to put
up with an ununderstafing force.

Thankfully, many stinks have been raised, par-
ticularly in the grade and high schools, by parents
who didn’t wish their children to be so oppressed by
a bunch of legal cheaters. Even the courts are get-
ting into the act. In New Jersey, a court ruled that

* a long haired youth be released from custody be-

cause he was arrested as a result of suspiciously
long hair. . . .

Mysteriously long hair seems to represent
something evil, dirty, untrustworthy. How many
times have you heard of kids being embarrassed in
Little League, people stopped on highways, and
shortchanged by athletic committees because of the
quantity of hair.  --

Take the case of a young track athlete who com-

peted in the PIAA (Pennsylvania Interscholastic «

Athletic Association) this past spring. This runner
won the trials in the 120 yard intermediate hurdles
wearing a head band to control his hair. In the finals
he was ordered to remove the band. He ran a dismal
race because his hair hinderedzhis. eyesight. Taking
his head band was worse than taking away his eligi-
bility. What do they make head bands for anyway?

‘ But, the times, they have to be changing. Pete
Rose, also known as Joe Hustle, is even letting his

 

locks grow. He no longer wears a crewcut. Do you 
think Khayat would let Joe Namath play on his '_

team ?

In the fall of 1972, there will be a few healthy . if

crops ofhair on the Pitt football team. There are

others, but Joe Hendron, Reggie Frye,‘-Ernie Webs-_ ’
ter, Jim Buckmon (Afros), Bob Medwid, Jim Stein,  ‘
Jim Parros, and Eric Knisely would make good,"

prospects for Dry Look commercials.

Winning football games has nothing to do with

length of hair. The_military academices have prov- ,

en that the last few years.

Carl DePasqua. is one of the coaches that has i

changed his mind recently. Last year‘ DePasqua or-
dered his players to visit the barber. Nothing.

against Joe Panucci, the team barber, but the news

was refreshing.

“I don’t mind if the ‘players haveilong hair,’«’. 
Carl said, “as long as it isn’t dirty and it's well}?

groomed. I don’t think I ought to make it an issue.‘

Besides_I think the fad will blow over-in a couple of -5

years anyway.”

Chatman Leaves Grid
To Pursue Grap Goal

~ John Chatman," who chose to persue both wrestling and football
’ careers’ when coming to Pitt has decided to eliminate one of the sports,
football. H, , _

 » _.Chatman was an explosive weapon on the gridiron last year, as
{he led all kickoff returners with a 27.9 (44.) yards a return and av-
eraged a good 5.0 yards a carry from the line of scrimmage.

C In all, Chatman ran for 309 yards on 61 attempts and caught eight
passes for 79 yards. He was expected to be an outside threat with

and was on his way around rightend, when he
was unfortunately hit.

Dave Janasek, a sophomore back, is expected
to replace the injured fullback.

Felinczak has undergone surgery at Presby-
terian Hospital to correct the injury.

With over 100 brawny lads at his disposal, De
Pasqua kept his word. The new wishbone offense
couldn’t have looked any worse in the first week,
but as time took its course, it became evident that
it would be ready by September 9th.

Bob Medwid will be at the helm of the wish-
bone against Florida State. Lou Cecconi and Bill

. Englert look like the halfbacks, with Stan Ostrow-

ski not far behind. And until hisiinjury, Felinczak
was great at fullback. Now it looks like Dave Jane-

sek, on an even basis with Felinczak with power_~

and quickness, but lacking experience.

Defensively, the_ squad .“is much improved,”
said the -man who coordinates it, Ralph Jelic.

The defensive backs have .the experience and v

the front line has the muscle. There is a little un-
certainty at the linebacking slots.

Returning starter Bill Buckmon will be one of
the defensive-..ends. Buckman, who has greatness
predicted for him by coach Chuck Gottfried,
should work well with John Moss, wfio has made
the transition from running back to defensive end
an explosive success. Eric Knisely, Rod Kirby, Phil
Belejchak, and Tom Perko gives that position good
depth. ‘

The defensive tackles are the biggest,’ as a
group, of the whole team. Glenn Hyde, and John
Robb have inside tracts on the starting jobs. Dave
Jancinsin and freshman Paul Mariano are stars of
the near future. Wrestler Carl Roba, though in-
jured through “most of practice is also counted
on. -

Middle guard, right now, belongs to Art .Venzin.
Mike Heiber, and Spencer Potter are also work-
ing hard at that position.

Reggie Frye, Joe Henddon, Dan Rullo, Bill
Adams, are the knowing defensive backs. Who
will start against the seminoles has to still be de-
cided by Jelic, Mike Bullino impressed everyone

Camp in Summer

at camp with his hard hitting. Jim Parros has also I
shown wel.l but needs confidence, according to

Jelic. ~ .
“Marstellar has improved 120 per cent over last

_year,” assured Jelic. “We still have work to do,

but we have that experience.”

At the linebacking position, George Feherl has

one position locked up. The other slot is up for
grabs. Bill Mercer, Ken Paieski, Lou Julian, Carlos
-Hamlin, and Gary Patterson are literally battling
for the otherjob. _ \ "

Offensively again, Rick Lozier, Ernie Webster,
Dave Wannstedt, Reynold Stoner, Tony? Kuzneski,
will handle the offensive interior line.

Les Block, who suffered from mononucleosis ,

during the summer is the tight end. Block, who
took it easy the first week, had‘ really turned it on
at the end. Walk-on Tod Toerper has earned his

position at split end. Toerper reputatadly has none. ,

of the speed that he should have, but he has a
magnificent pair of hands and he proved it at John-
stown. - ‘

 To put the hay in the barn, as coach Steve Petro
put it, the time has come for the story to begin.

“We had a year to grow. Now it’s time to show
progress,” said D.ePasqua, so convincing-ly«.~ 

In chess they have a word for that time: ‘Check’

Monday Pitt’s Dick Rydze captured the Silver Medal. in the Olym-
pic Games in the 10 meter dive event.

Rydze was only holding on to fifth place after the first seven
compulsory dives. Going into the final dive, however, he had man-
aged to splash his way to third.

On his final attempt'Rydze hit with a beautiful back two and one,
half summersault in the pike position.

This effort was good enough to obtain for Rydze a 64.38 score
and a permanent claim on second place.

The Mount Lebanon native is in his second year of medical school'/

at Pitt; For‘his undergraduate work he attended the University of
Michigan and swam under the direction of Coach Dick Kimball.

' Atone timeiin’ his track career, at the very start-
of his career, Bill Rea wasnot deserving of head-
lines. But as time took its course, it became evi-
dent tothe most casual-observer that Bill Rea-
should soon be‘ a ‘name newspapers would have to
cope with. ' s ‘ I
As a sophomore that time for a most deserving
3 Bill Rea ’ came. The headlines,
:. ough few, also came. On July 7-
‘ 8. Rea just ‘missed. q u a l i f.y i n g
for one of the three long jump
. positions insthe 1972 Summer
Olympics in Munich, Germany_. _
Aboutza yearago, on May 8,
1971, as a certain’ collegiate sportswriter viewed
the second annual Pitt Invitational at,Pitt.Stadium,
a man in the staudsuarsked the-. sportswriter who ..-Bill,
Rea was,-after. hearing ,on- the PA system that, Rea

I r~x...:‘ord at West Virginia (22’9”) and had set a‘ new -
' Pitt Field House long jump mark '(23’5”) d\uring_
,3-‘the indoor season. a V ‘

Not even the delighted Rea, -with his pleasant
smile, slender face", and moppy hair knew what was
ahead of him at that time. ' r .

“I was just thinking of breaking Pitt records,”
Rea reminisced last month. “I wanted to break

- Herb Douglas’ long jump record of 25’3”. I wasn’t'
even thinking about the Olympics until I jumped
25’7”. ' - \

Once thatihappened, Rea became obsessed with
the Olympics. As he kept jumping, publicity people
became aware of that same possibility. First, Rea

which is still the fourth best jump in the world this
year. t ’ in . 2:-r ' “ vi - «
With that jump, Rea.qualifi'ed’ forthe Olympic
Trials and it was a matter of time before he would

"get his big chance;

The record now shows that Bill Rea earned the
alternate position on that Munich lbokd team (he
would have made the trip if- any of the other tvee
athletes sustained an injury - or -could not ..have
made the trip for some other reason). Unfortunate-
ly, this was not to be the case. '

The week before the trials in Eugene, Ore., Rea
and his coach; Jim Banner, registered at a’ local‘

Holiday Inn to relax in air conditioned peace and_

quiet. But eventually, Bill missed his bigatrip by a
mere .three-fourths of an inch. _ I ‘ '
Army’s Arnie Robinson won the Trials with a

,26’.43/4’? jump. A surprising‘Preston Carrington,

and Randy Williams from USC bothjumped 26’31/2”
totie for second place, thus shattering Rea’s hopes.
His 26’23/4” jump, his second best ever, was useless.

“I was confident. I expected to make the team.
I guess I succeeded in a sense by making it as an

alternate.” A

With the trials behind him, Rea plans to go after
the world record in the long jump 27’2”.. He plans

to lift weights and peak at the NCAA national indoor -

championships. V j _ x ‘

Performing in front of 180,000ipeople in the
ten day period Bill was both disappointed that he
couldn’t have won a slot on the team and because
of two letters or phone calls he didn’t receive.

“The University backed me financially," he
said, “No complaints there. But, it would have been

5 Because, of a change in NCAA eligibility regu-
. -lations, freshman will be allowed to compete on
the varsity level, this year. As a result, there will be
no freshman football team this season at Pitt. In its
place will be a junior varsity team.

The JV team will be comprised mostly of fresh-

A men, but upperclassmen will be allowed to com-
' pete as well. The Cubs will play a three-game sche-

  dule and each player is permitted to play in a to-

tal of eleven games, which means that if a player gets

  _into all three JV games, he can only play in eight
' -'5' 4 of the eleven varsity games. '

The junior varsity will receive a lot of attention
this year and it could also be helpful for injured
varsity players playing their way into shape, as
well as quarterbacks who don’t get into every

this season, the junior varsity will enable many

Forecasts Dim

For Gridders

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

It seems to be a concensus of opinion among professional foot-
ball forecasters that the Pitt Panthers are going to have a rough time
trying to equal last season’s mark of 3-8.

Playboy has gone so far as to predict that the Cats can expect
nothing better than two wins against nine losses.

Each year the‘ Panthers take on one of the toughest schedules
in the nation and ’72 will prove. to be just as difficult as Pittsburgh
confronts ‘the likes of Penn State, Notre Dame, West‘ -Virginia-and
Florida State(the remaining teams on the schedule are no pushovers
either)?

Coach Carl De Pasqua has been fortunate enough to have re-
tained his top eight rushers and he is going to try to make the best of
their abilities by employing the Wishbone. .

“We want to do more with our running offense, especially
the outside attack with the option," related DePasqua. But as foot-
ball magazine Gameplan points out he may have no other choice.

DePasqua’s number one passer, Dave Havern, and his top three

receivers have all graduated, leaving‘ the success or failure of the.

Wishbone in the hands of junior quarterback Bob Medwid. The 6-21/2,
190-pounder had taken‘ over the quarterback position last seaso,n,un-

til he suffered a broken collar bone during the 31-21 win over .Syra- P

cusé. .,
Behind Medwid there is John Hogan, who, according tothe writ-

the Wishbone snaps it will be up to senior Hogan to repair the
Cat’soffense. , . ‘ -' 

Should the Wishbone not materialize, it would present even more
pressure on an already questionable defense‘. ‘

During the "71 campaign the Panthers allowed their opponents
to rack up 388 points and only two regulars are returning up front — '

tackle Glenn Hyde and defensive end Jim Buckmon. -

The Panther secondary is very much‘ intact, however’; And as
Gameplan sees it, the Cat’s secondary even sparkles.
With Reggie Frye, Ed Marstellar, Dan Rullo, and Joe tlerndon Pitt

As Gameplan so ‘optimistically’ stated it, “The (Pitt) scheduleiis

absolutely brutal, but DePa'squa does have some good material. A

bounce or two in‘their direction

could spell four victories for the Pan-

DePasqua rejects the professional forecasters’ type of optimism_,—
he has his own that he adheres to. -

’./.\

The Pitt mentor looks for a better showing in ’72 and has confi-,
dence in what his players can do and ’not what
capable of.

“I know what the magazines have been saying," stated DePasqua.
"But you can’t put any value in it. We’ll be improved this year.”

The penalties may seem harsh for some-

_n_ess. But the fact remains: The law does .

“I think football is played on

They have long hair and they
are good football players.”

 ‘Gazebo’   Favored Yogi

Like death and taxes, the Pitt
News sports is once again cor-
ralled by the irrepressible Yogis
who will once again peer into the
future of the weekly college foot-
ball action.

Only two veterans return this
season and along with five rookies
they will battle furiously for the
coveted spot held in recent years
by. such stalwarts as “Zelmo”
Hellman and “Big Poison” Pattak.

On the basis of last year’s show-
ing, “Gazebo” DiNardo has been
established as the pre-season fav-

orite, while “Rupert” Buccigrossi
has also been named as a favorite
—to come in last.

“Don’t bet on me coming in be-
hind everyone,” shouted an an-
gered “Rupert” as the Yogi’s
gathered. “We’ve got a real patsy
this year in “Souvenier” SiegeI.”

While “Souvenier” and “Ru—
pert” may battle for the booby
prize, “Big” Mack may put ev-
eryone on ice.

“I’ll fry you all,” he declared
egotistically.

“Gazebo” “Eupert" “SchemIvin" “Poor"“Souvenir" “I2osey" “Sonny Guido‘

Silently, “Sonny Guido” I De-

Vito crept into the meeting. “I’ll

make you guys an offer you can't V

refuse,” he whispered.
“What’s that,” asked a bewild-

ered “Rosey” Rosenthal, another .

Yogi.

“If you let me win, I’ll see what
my friends can do for you,” he
asserted.

“Gazebo” just sat back into his
chair and smiled at the Schmuck

of the group, “Schmelvin” Meltz—‘
er.
