Discusses

Petitions

By LAURIE MocLEOD

The Student Government ‘
Board (SGB) ‘Task Force for
Financial. Aid discussed the
petition denouncing student
aid cutbacks and the letter writ-
ing campaigns at a meeting
attended by eight members on
Wednesday.

The task force came up with
ideas for presenting the peti-
tions to ‘senators which
included staging outdoor ral-
lies and going to Washington,—
but finally decided to try to have
Reps. William. Coyne or Frank
Pistella attend the last SGB
meeting of the term and present
the petitions to one of them.

Letter writing campaign
tables will be set up this week to
help Pitt students write letters
to their representatives and
senators. 

Each day the tableswill be in
a different location including
Beiiedum Hall, Forbes Quad,
Student Union, Chemistry
Building and the Cathedral of

Committee chairwoman Con-
nie Kreischer devised a hypo-

ideas. “It will give students who
have never written to congress-
men ideas on how to start and
what to say,” said task force
chairman Todd DeLuca.

The tables will supply the
addresses of Governor Thorn-

A burgh and U.S. Senators John

Pitt Prof Asenate Candidate

By ROCHELLE STEVWING

Liane Norman, a Pitt Eng-
lish professor, has announced her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate.

Norman, who holds a seat on the
board of directors of the Thomas
Merton Center and is an associate
member of the Physicians for
Social Responsibility, sees the

main issue of the campaign as

being the threat presented by
‘ nuclear weapons and war.

iWhen asked her reason for run-
ning, Norman said, “It gives me a
chance to raise the fundamental
issue confronting all Americans,
and that is whether they plan to
survive." -

Norman said that nuclear wea-
pons and the military have an effect
on every aspect of Americans’ lives.
Her campaign will revolve around
these weapons. and their far-
reaching effects.

According to Norman, the mil-
itary has to do with “how wealth is
distributed,” foreign policy, “con-

.

ceptions of civil liberties," "the

readiness with which government.

officials believe that they can
coerce citizens into doing what vio-
lates their own best interests,” and
with iindustry’s ability to use
energy, money and talent in fulfil-
ling military contracts.

Norman said that the thing set-
ting her apart from other,candi-
dates is her “insistence that the first
issue that confronts us is the issue
of nuclear weaponry." This
includes the concept of war. Nor-
man, a confirmed pacifist, favors
the abolition of war and said she
believes that she is the only candi-
date advocating this.

Although Norman has had
limited experience in electoral
politics, she notes that ordinary
citizens are competent enough to
govern themselves. ‘ i

“Citizens are the government," '

Norman said. “Wegare misled if we
think that professional politicians
are the only ones competent to
make policy decisions.

Norman's platform and appeal
will be directed towards the ordi-
nary citizen and his ability to know
what is in his best interest.

To reach" citizens, Norman
intends to send out canvassers, who
will explain the Consumer Party
and Norman’s views. ‘ '

“What I» would most like to
achieve from this campaign is a
modest grass-roots effort to awaken
the confidence and the sense of
adult responsibility on the part of
the people in .Western Pennsylva-
nia and across the state,” Norman
said.

Another thing that Norman
would like to do in her campaign is
to refer to the Defense Department
as “the Departinent of Murder,"
which she said she believes is the
business of that department and a
more accurate term.

When asked about the issue of
abortion, [Norman answered,
“Abortion, in my mind, is one of
the genuine dilemmas."

Does Reagan Have A Middle East Foreign Policy ?

By BILL HESS

As President Reagan's budget
cuts and defense spending pol-
icy continue to create outrage

and despair, many experts,

believe his “honeymoon" with
the American people is coming
to an end.

A major topic of debate is

“It doesn't appear that he
plans to seek peace in the Mid-

Sopko added.

“If they officially withdraw,
they will continue to make their
presence known. I don’t feel the
Reagan Administration has
done enough to forcethe Israe-
lis out of the Sinai,” said Sopko.

‘President Reagan is very
much interested in
avoiding an outbreak of
hostilities and uses
American influence

but to focus on the big picture
of ending hostilities.

“On the process of policy
making, experts in the State
Department don’t always agree,
especially on matters related to
the Arab-Israeli conflict. But
there has been a fair amount of

more in touch with what was
going on because Kissinger and
Ford had a pretty clear-cut pol-
icy. Carter was also clear, in that
his policy was based on peace
and hur'nanitarianism,” said

Spring is here and Pitt students
will have the opportunity to cele-
brate this weekend with “Spring
Fling.” "This will be one of Pitt's
greatest college weekends," said
Becky Sloads, the chairperson for
the event.
_ Sponsoring this four day serie‘_
of fun-filled events are the Office of
Residence Life (ORL) and the Res-
ident Student Association (RSA).
Having been previously open to
only dorm residents, the ORL and
RSA invite all Pitt students to par-
 in the third annual Spring
Fli g.

The Spring Fling, which started
yesterday, will continue until Sun-

day. Events run from mudwres—
tling and rollerskating to a variety
show and beauty contest. Some
events, such as the softball tourna-
ment, had to be signed up for in
advance, but most other events and
activities are wide open for
participation.

While the Super Stars competi-
tion is a serious athletic event, just
the opposite will be true of the
“Anything Goes" event. Students
adept at carrying eggs in spoons ,
while holding the spoons in their
mouths and walking down steps
and -other unusual types of things
should join in on this one.

“The university doesn’t offer any
spring activities for its students

PRASA Presents S-pringFIing

that's why the ()RL and the RSA
are sponsoring it," said Sloads.
“It's perfectly timed—right after
Hand-In Hand Festival and two
weeks before final examinations.
It’s a good time for the students to
get out. relieve winter tension and
have some fun before preparing for
finals.‘ ~ A *

T-shirts, pizzas, certi.ficates for’
dinners. McDonald's coupons and
trophies are some "of the prizes
offered, all donated by various
community businesses.

The Spring Fling will wind
down on Sunday afternoon with
movies, featuring Peter Sellers and
the Three Stooges, being shown
until midnight in the Forbes Quad.

Pitt students Jim Ammons and Bob Duca literally got involved in itt’s‘prrng Fling” lasi

The entertainment at the

magician and master of illu-
sionary entertainment who is
known to many people, simply
as Doug Crawford. Crawford
recently took time to_ fill me in
on his show and his view of
magic in general.

vary the material from the aver-
age magician’s show. I have
lighting, music, and lots of
movement. Much of the show
I've developed myself and I’m
very pleased with it; I think peo-
ple really enjoy it.”

About magic, Crawford said,
“Illusionary magic is what I
perform; I do notbelieve in
supernatural magic. A‘ magi-
cian, to those in the profession;
is someone who does small
tricks and an illusionist is a per-
former who does the larger

_ tricks.

“To lay people, this cause
confusion; they thinkofa magi-
cian as a supernatural per-
former. That is where the
Christian conflict comes in; I’m
a Christian and I don’t see any
evil influences in my involve-
ment in magic,” Crawford said.

“Magic is a performing art, like A

dancing, or singing. Performers
such as Houdini and Black-
stone have been accused of
being Satanic,_ but this is a mis-
take; all they do are illusions.
It’s all entertainment.”

—.Crawford is critical of him-
self and his show. During his
RSA banquet performance he
had a troublesome start, but
once hegot rolling the show
flowed smoothly._The best of

Crawford's tricks included the

linking rings, his quarter catch
(pulling coins from mid air),
and the closing illusion-—
making a can of Coke appear
from nowhere.

Resigns

continued from page one

(irrevocable) decision to resign the
chairmanship effective July 1.
I982.”

Sussman’s term is scheduled to
end Jtlly l, 1983. He refused to

comment on [I10 matter.

*-Some members of the depart-

ment have expressed concern that
divisions within the department
have grown wider because of dis-

agreements over direction of the

department.

Questions have been raised that
the number of.majors may have
declined because the department
stressed research over teaching.

Biology professor Harry Corwin
said in the past he has been on the
record as saying the biological

sciences department is more con-

cerned with research than with
teaching.

Professor Stanley Shostak said

that the mission of the university is

’  facliillg, that recent decisions have

been made totally on the grounds
of research and that these decisions
will inevitably disrupt the
department.

“Decisions should be made on
the grounds of what is.in the best
interest of the mission of the
department,” said Shostak.' He said
Sussman “is resigning over what is
totally irrelevant to the mission of
the university.” J

Shostak said that teaching and

research must go hand in hand,

that one must not ,come at the
expense of the other.

The number of biological scien-
ces majors have dropped from 573
in‘ 1976, whenthe department was
merged from the biology, biochem-
fs’try, biophysics and microbiology
departments and ‘ Sussman
assumed the chair, to 260 majors
currently. .

“There's no question that Suss- I

man has made tremendous

_contributions—-he’s built a

research institute,” Shostak said.

He attributed the decline in
majors to‘ the emphasis on
research.

On government-sponsored
research, the university receives
additional funding‘ from the
government. After direct ‘costs of
the research are figured, the univer-

sity receives 52 percent of that fig- , .

ure to administer the research. This
':_used to cover and administer the
, r. _A ram. ' ”

"Sihostak said that he is afraid that
a battle is brewing within the
department over the issue of
research and teaching.

One facutly member, who asked
not to be identified, also noted a
lack of following the proper
departmental guidelines, adding
there exists a “make it up as you go
along" attitude.

Shostak, agreeing that such an
attitude exists, said that guidelines
ignored “when it -is
convenient.”

Shostak holds that the event

   
  

which precipitated Sussman’s‘

resignation was the dispute over

 appointment of a Mellon Pro-
' fessorship. A vote was taken among

the faculty, the results of which
were forwarded to the dean.

Three options were available for
those voting: accept the candidate
with the full package of benefits
included with the Mellon profes-
sorship; accept the candidate with-
out the benefits; or reject the
candidate.

Although the majority of the
voting faculty accepted the candi-
date,‘ several senior faculty
members questioned the qualifica-
tions of the candidate.

On these grounds, the dean

, riiased to authorize the appoitlt-
 ent, according to a memo from

Sussman to the faculty.
Another problem within the
department arose with the solicita-

rlle Pitt News, Friday, April 2, 1932

hairman

non of letters of recommendation.

Botll Sussman and professor,

Terry Cooper solicited letters, blit
there was solne question whether
Cooper’s was proper.

Dick Russell,a professor ill the
department, said there was “a dis-
pute over the form which a letter of
recommenda.tion should take and
what procedures are to be followed
in the event individual faculty
members wish to obtain ilidepend-
ent letters." \

He said that it was a matter of
opinion whether one was
improper or not. “It was a mix-up
ill conlmllnications." '

A grollp of faculty is attempting
to make Sussman reconsider. Rus-
sell, who leads the group, said the
group sees Sussman’s resigning
because of a lack of support by
faculty. He said this is a misunder-
standingion Sussman’s -part.

He said the group is trying to stir
supportlfor the chairman through
individual expression of the
faculty. He added that most of the
faculty does support Sussman. ,

Russell acknowledged that the
department has emphasized
research, but said that he doesn’t
believe that emphasis has been at
the expense of teaching.

“I think none of us sees a dichot-
omy between teaching and
research," said Lewis Jacobson, a‘
member of the group supporting
Sussman.

Russell said that the reason

behind the decline in majors has
been a national trend toward other
fields and that prospective majors

that computerscience is the thing

Shostak disagreed with Russell.
H/e_,,said there is no national trend

Others said these things (dis-

I putes within a department) are not

unusual. _
Cooper said disputes are “corn-

goal of academic excellence, a

the IRTS program

I By MARK STROUP

Harry Factor, an ABC sports
account executive, spoke Wednes-
day night ‘in the Forbes Quadran-
gle Seminar Suite on communica-
tions internships and different
careers in the broadcast industry.

Factor is governor of the Interna-
tional Radio and Television
Society (IRTS) and a member of
the IRTS Education Program
Committee, which awards
$125,000 in communications
internships each year.

Factor said approximately 1,000
juniors and seniors in communica-
tions will apply for the ten IRTS
internship positions this year. The
interns fill positions in advertis-
ing, research, sales and other area
related to broadcasting for various
companies in New York City.

Dr. Raymond Steele of Pitt's I

communications department said
“is sort of an

apex of opportunity” for those
aiming for an internship.

Although Factor said, "The
IRTS cannot afford more than ten
(internships)-—unfortunately," he

‘‘I recommend re-
search related-areas
most of all. People
have to figure out
what they’re going to
buy and what they’re
going to sell.

added that there are numerous
other worthwhile internships
available in communications.

Speaking on the broadcasting

Exec Discusses Internships

business itself, Factor said, “The
nuts and bolts ofthe business is to
sell products. The key is making
the client satisfied, rot happy,
satisfied.”

On starting a career in broadcast-
ing, Factor advised his listeners to
consider research-related areas.

“I recommend it most of all,”
Factor said. “People have to figure
out what theyfre going to buy, and
what they’re going to sell...once
you know the numbers, you can
make the numbers work for you.”

In terms of numbers, Factor’s
audience in" the Seminar Suite
wasn’t what was _hope for. Less
than 25 people were present at the
lecture sponsored by the Provost's
office and the Communications
Guild.

“l’m baffled.” said Alex Danen-
berg, chairman of the Cornmunica-
tions Guild. “I don’t understand
why people don't take advantage of
what's offered to them.”

ABC Sport Executive Harry Factor spoke to a group of

Pitt students Wednesday night about the importance of

internships in the communications field.

Apri|’s Foéis

April Fools’ Day, for whatever it's worth, probably has
more value as a commemorative day than all the Valen-
tine’s, Mother's, Father’s and Groundhog days combined.
Think of it: On what other day does this country rid itself

of useless schlock such as greeting cards, bogus television

specials and heart-shaped candies normally associated
with those other commemorative days?

No, April Fools’ Day is the one time of the year when
people can be as cruel as they want to their fellow human
beings, all under the guise of practical jokes. Well, the
editors of The Pitt News have had just about enough of
this senseless cruelty, and from now on pledge to tell only
the truth as we see it. What fol_lows are actual events that
have occured on- and off-campus recently; ‘

O Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar, upset with the dispro-
portionate amount of money being directed toward the
athletic department and football team, has demanded that
all television revenues for Pitt basketball and football
games be funnelled into the budgetsof the geography
department and the College of Arts and Sciences.

0, The Student Government Board realized for the first
time recently that it has served little purpose on this cam-
pus other than to provide a method for student politicians
to lengthen their resumes. The board then voted to dis-
band permanently. ‘ '

O‘ In a similar action, Pitt's board of trustees, finally
recognizing the fact that it has done little more in its
existence other than rubber stamping administrative poli-
cies, also authorized a resolution to disband. As part of the
resolution, the trustees have transferred whatever power
they had into the Office of the Chancellor.

0 With his new powers, Chancellor Posvar has report-
edly ordered all the students and faculty out of the Cathe-
dral of Learning to _ma/ke"way for a collection of fancy
boutiques and expensive restaurants. As part of the con-
tracts drawn up between the university and the businesses,
Posvar has demanded a 50 percent cut of all gross revenues
generated by the businesses during the term of the
contracts. ‘

O In the face of violent protests by persons wearing bags
over their heads, the management of Burger Chef has‘
called out the campus police to quell what it claimed were
“radical insurgents carrying explosive bag lunches."

0 Campus police, wielding night sticks, mace and M-60
maching guns have..been ordered to"‘shoot to kill” any
persons carrying bag lunches. _

0 Jackie Sherrill announced ‘his resignation recently
from his coachingposition at Texas A8cM because of what
he described as “the alarming effects ofbigimoney in
collegiate sports.” ‘ ‘ ,

O The state legislature has scolded the governor for

. recommending Pitt's request of a l4.5 percent increase in_

state support for the upcoming fiscal year. The governor
issued a statement announcing that he will grant the
entire appropriation request, plus an additional $15 mil-

lion for the School of Medicine. _ t
O Foge Fazio, saying that he was concerned with the
declining level of academic quality represented on his

-Dear Editor:

I want to complain about an
incident that occurred Monday
night, March 29, involving the Pitt
campus police. It occurred about
ll:35 p.m. in front of the Towers
on the Fifth Avenue side. Two

campus police officers attacked-

and beat a young man’ for no
apparent reason. An onlooker who

objected to the extreme use of force ‘

by the police was told to stay out.
After walking away, he‘ was
arrested too. A

As I remember, this isiexactly
what happened: two guys were
drinking beer and walking just
ou tside the Towers doorway. They
didn’t seem to be bothering
anyone. They were. just talking,
but not loudly. No one seemed to
be disturbed by them or by any-
thing at all at the time, which is"
unusual for that particular place.’
As a matter of fact, it seemed like a
rather quiet and boring evening.
Suddenly, the two campus officers

» began to‘ chase the two guys. They e

caught up to them in front of one of
the Towers and pushed each guy
against a ground floor Towers
window. The heavyset cop, the one
on the right, pulled out his night-
stick and forcefully smashed his
victim over the head. The guy's

back was turned to the cop the

whole time, and his hands were in
the air. The cornered guy began to
bleed profusely and turned to
defend himself. The cop kept
swinging, lower, at the guy's ribs,
but he seemed to miss. The guy
gave up and was handcuffed by
another officer who had arrived at
the scene.

Meanwhile, the victim’s friend
was surrounded by undercover
policemen. The undercover police-
men had come from an unmarked

car that had sped down Thackeray _

Street just as the beating started,
and they ran across Fifth Avenue.
There were at least two of them.
Some other uniformed Pitt police

_ had shown tip too. Also, a young

male bystander was helping to
subdue the victim's friend, who by
this time was pleading and fight-
ing to go to help his friend who had
been hit. The heavy cop then catne

over to this other group and began ‘

to taunt the victim's friend, poking
at him with the nightstick. The
police then handcuffed the second
guy. '

By now the bystander began to

object to the brutality of the arrests.
He seemed really angry about what
he had just seen. So was I, and all
the other onlookers were too. The
heavyset cop told the bystander to
“Get the f—-- out of here." The
young man cursed back and
walked away, still cursing. He
walked down the steps toward the
campus Book Center. The cops
changed their minds about this
young man and arrested him.at the
bottom of the steps. He was
searched, handcuffed and taken
away. ,

I didn't like what I’ saw that
night, and I don’t think anyone
else who saw it did either. Was all
that violence really necessary? It
didn't look like it to me. Did they
really need six or more police offic-
ers to arrest two people drinking a
quart of beer? Did the fact that the
two victims were _black and the two
arresting officers white have any-
thing to do with it? How come the

right thing by objecting to the bru-
tality. I wasn't brave enough to do
it, so now I want to help if I can. I
want to help him and the two guys
who were attacked and arrested, if
possible. I am asking for witne‘

Sophomore Bob Myers and fellow hurler Tom Seebacher pitched almost flawlessly
the Panthers swept a doubleheader lrom Duquesne yesterday. Pitt faces Townson
State today at'Trees Field in a 2:30 p.m. game.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The Pitt Panther men’s volley-
ball team’s dreams of challenging
Penn ‘State's death grip over the rest
of the East were swept away Wed-

inesday in three ego-bruising

games.

The Nittany Lions, first-ranked
in the East and No. 4 nationally.
buried Pitt 2-I5, ll-15 and 9-15 at
Penn State's Rec Hall, in a match
which Panther coach Ray Reilly

said “started out bad and stayed
,,"bad." '

The Lions, featuring much the
same lineup that advanced to the
national championship finals last
year, completely “outplayed and
outfought” Pitt. The Panthers, in
addition to making numerous mis-
takes, especially on defense, were
also afflicted by something even
more surprising—a lack of
confidence.

Heading into the match, many
of Pitt's players spoke often of the
confidence last month’s two-game
split with Penn State had yielded.
On Wednesday, "such assurance

_-.\.-ias strictly in Penn State's

“You'd think the bottom of the
world fell out. We just played
timid, scared ball," said Pitt (loach
Reilly. "We just stunk. It was

By SCOTT DELLETT

Wrigley Field in Chicago and
Candlestick Park in San Francisco
are two baseball stadiums where
strong swirling winds pass above

"the playing field. Major League

ballpark aren’t the only ones
affected by winds. Trees Field was
windy yesterday afternoon, but it
wasn't an ill wind for the Pitt base-
ball team as they swept a double-
header from the Duquesne Dukes
with scores of 7-2 and 13-0.

Timely hitting and strong pitch-
ing were the “main ingredients in
the Panther’s success. While the
hitting was with theteam in Flor-
ida, the pitching wasn’t. But if the
rest of the staff performs like Bob
Meyers and Tom Seebacher did yes-
terday, then Coach Bobby Lewis
will have no problem forgetting
ghe five pitchers he lost from last
season.

Meyers and Seebacher, both
sophomore left-handers, each
pitched complete game victories.
Meyers scatteredfive hits to give the
Panthers their first victory of the
season. Seebacher topped Meyer's
fine performance, tossing a two hit
shutout, striking out three Dukes
and showing pinpoint control
under windy conditions, walking
only one batter.

Lewis believes his pitching staff
is progressing since their shaky
performance in Florida. V

“The pitchers are rounding into
shape,” said Lewis. “They took a
beating in Florida, but they won't
let it get them down. There is a lot
of talent there and they will
develop, as long as the-y throw

if under game conditions.”

The hitting, one of the strong
points of the Panther’s trip,

A re-mains potent according to Lewis.

“The hitting is still there,"
Lewis said. “We scored a lot of runs
in Florida.”

And they did yesterday-—Doug
Steiner opened the game’with a
walk and advanced to second on an
errant pick-off attempt. Center-‘
fielder‘ Tim Schwadron drove in
Steiner with a single. '

Bill Knuth and Pitt's other trontcourt players spiked well when the passing game didn’t break down, but the
Panthers’ offensively in th_eir_loss to Penn State.

,

After Duquesne tied the score ir.
lfhe bottom of the first, Pitl

regained the lead in the fourth
inning. Freshman shortstop Paul
Westwood doubled and second
baseman Mike Miller drovehim in
with a single.

The Panthers broke the game
wide open in the fifth inning, send-
ing nine men to the plate while
scoring five runs. Tony LaCava
opened the inning with a single
and moved to second on a wild
pitch. After Glenn Howe moved
him over to third on a single, third
baseman Tom Horew’s single
scored LaCave and moved Horew
to ‘second. Westwood belted his
second double of the game, scoring
both Howe and Horew. Steiner and
Mike Fitzpatrick hit back-to—back
doubles, scoring two more runs.

The Dukes scored a meaningless

run in the bottom of the seventh,
and the Panthers had finally won
their first game after suffering six
consecutive losses in their first six
games. i ’
_ Pitt started off the first inning of
the second game like gangbusters,
sending ten ‘batters to the plate and
scoring five runs.
_ Steiner opened the game by get-
{ting hit in the left shoulder.
Fitzpatrick hit into a force-out and
stole second. After Howe walked,
LaCava hit a towering line drive
which caught a strong breeze and
went over the rigth—centerfield
fence for a three-run homer.

But the scoring didn’t>stop there.
Paul Westwood reached first on an
error and advanced to third on Dar-
rell Gissendanner’s double. Tom
Horew drove both players in with a
single.

The Panthers added to the lead
in the second inning. After Fitzpat-
rick grounded out, Howe drew’ a
walk went to third on LaCava’s
double. The wind that aided LaCa-
va’s home run may have taken
away one from Westwood, as his
high fly to center stayed inlthe play-
ing area. The deep fly out scored
Howe and gave Pitt a 6-0 lead.

Gissendanner drove in another
run as he punched a single between

the third baseman and shortstop.

about gymnastics until seventh
grade when he was “dragged into
the sport by my cousins.”

He has obviously learned a lot
since junior high, ‘winning many
awards in, high school" and
throughout his college career. At

-excelled in gymnastics and was

captain of the 1977-78 State Cham-

Co-captain Bob Besong got into gymnastics at.the ‘urging of his two cousins. Since
that inauspicious start,'his career has been marked by excellence.

Gazette Athlete of the Week, and
WPIAL All-Around Champion
among his other honors.

The winning didn’tend there.
Besong came to Pitt because “the
coach was good, it was close to
home and a full ‘scholarship was
tempting. He went on to further
his abilities as a national caliber
gymnast. P

1 Born in Baden, he isithe oldest of
a very close family-of six, including
two younger sisters, Charlene and
Michelle, and a younger brother,
Michael, who is also very involved
with gymnastics at Slippery Rock
State College. They all learned a lot

about discipline, 5 ‘dedication and -

“I was reprimanded when I was
bad and praised when I was good.

Senior Bob Besong excels in the all-around as well as his
lavorite evenl— the floor excercise. Despite his excellent
scoring average in the event, Besong predicted making it to
the finals at Nationals will be extremely hard.

Besong SetFor Nationals

’By ANN WALKER .

We were brought up to be normal,
everyday kids.” Besong said.

He always dreamed of being a
good enough gymnast to" go to
Nationals, and when-he came to
Pitt, he began to collect awardsjust
as he had done at Ambridge. Just a
few , of his accomplishments
include being a ~four-year letter-
man, co—captain of the team for the
past two years, a member of /the
1981, All-East team, and won first-
place honors at the Pitt Invita-
tional gymnastics meet, also held
in 1981. s

- Just being invited to Nationals is
quite an accomplishment, but Bob

. hopes to make it to the finals being

held tomorrow. There are approxi-
mately 60 competitors from across
the nation competing in each

event, and only the top eight will

make it to the finals. From those
eight, the best six will gain the title
of All-America.

“This will be the roughest com-
petition for me. The top five guys
are usually the Olympic team; last
year’s national champion is back,
and Steve Eliot, second in the

.world in tumbling, will be there.

It's the stiffest competition all
year," Besong said.

He says he’s competing for hirn-
self as well as representing Pitt.
This will be Besong’s second trip"to
Nationals, as it is for Dave Smith,
who will also be competing for Pitt
in the floor exercise.

“I’d go to see Nationals when I
was in high school, and it taught
me a lot by just watching the com-
petitors. It made me set my goals
higher‘ and work hard enough to
get there some day. I learned about
style and technique," Besong said,
“remembering what it was likejust
being in the crowd.”

In preparation for Nationals,
Besong has been practicing twice
and sometimes three times as hard
as he usually does. He goes
through a semi-ritual before he
performs by listening to loud rock-
and-roll music and drinking lots of
coffee to “pep" himself up.

“I don't get nervous until right
before the meet. I think about the
meet and my routines, but the min-
ute the competition begins and we

‘march out, I start getting a little

nervous,”Besong said.

He said that during a “trick,” a
gymnastic move, he blocks out all
noise and focuses his total concen-
tration on his routine.

Stay Dominant  

B_y SEAN BARNES

The 1981-82 college swimming
season is overand Pitt head coach
Fred Lewis reflected on the season
with disappointment because none
of his swimmers gained All-
American honors at Nationals in
Milwaukee last weekend. But All-
America is what it takes to please

Lewis, for sending the East’s larg- ‘

est team was not enough.

Of the 13 Panthers who scored
enough points for Pitt’s second
place finish at Easterns a month
ago, eight of them went on to
Nationals, and six will return next
year.»Coach Lewis will direct his
training again this summer, next
fall and winter toward these same
National goals.

“With almost one-third of the
returning team having National
experience and some top recruits in
the events we hurt in, well remain
the Eastern power we are,” said

Lewis. Recruiting for next year is

centered on long distance power
swimmers. With/100-yard individ-

ual medley (IM) swimmers Sandy_

Pidgeon and Greg Pelton graduat-

ing Lewis will need new swimmers —

who are ready to endure the pain it
takes to swim events like the IM
and longdistance freestyle events,
which are the hardest eventsin any
meet. .

Coach Lewis, a long distance
freestyler himself, has his eye on a
few candidates for the 1982-83
squad. “The long distance events
are where we hurt the most with
only Greg Murphy swimming the
20-and 66-lap events at Easterns.

V These are also the weaker events of

-many teams in the East and could

be a big point-getter for us next

yearf’ _.

Coach Lewis already has his
team back in the water doing good
repetitive background yardage,
while toning up by running up

   

{-2-:3: ..

Jerry Zaleski

and down Pitt stadium and lifting
weights. “Swimming is an all year
sport,” said‘Lewis. “What a team
does over the summer can make all
the difference when the heat of the
season rolls around in January
through March.”

Pitt will return a strong team as
three of the six returning National-
ists are freshmen this year. Ed
LaNoue, Ed Bergan and Greg
Murphy all went to Nationals and

- dominated the East -in this their

first year at Pitt. LaNoue will take

Krug Gets Divers To

The Pitt men's diving team has
undergone a tough season this
year. Injuries and academic prob-
lems left only one diver to defend
the.Eastern Champion Diving title
coach Julian Krug and his divers
achieved in Krug's first two seasons
as coach. But this will change dras-
tically next year, as Krug goes
recruiting andthe Pitt team hopes
to boast as many as eight divers.

“l’ve learned a lot from such a
tough season with only one men's
diver,” said Krug. “I’ve always
tried recruiting the absolute best
divers, but this year I looked par-

ticularly hard at potential and atti- I

tudes. I’ve already signed divers
who were City League Champions
«and State Finalists. They may not
be as strong as, say, Dale Dimitzrak
(who was awarded the Most Out-
standing Diver at Easterns and
trained under Krug this summer),
but I've been diving many years
and I see talent that just needs the
right facilities and coach. I don't
think I’m being conceited when I
say Pitt has both.”

Although Publlif Opinion and

ample reason to Suspect that the

staff will find itself'in a state of
shambles. ’

Infielders -Dale Berra and
JOIIIIDY Ray are unproven and
untested, Dave Parker has
struggled with the bat as well as
with the Pittsburgh fans, in recent
years,_ and the bullpen is
inconsistent.

In that bullpen stands the key to
the Pirates success this season-
Kent Tekulve, the toothpick-like
sinkerball pitcher who put out the
fire no fewer than 90 times during
the 1979 championship year and
completed rescues with great

agularity.

‘we, eeeoeeeeeoeeeeqeeeee?eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

But during the past two seasons,
Tekulve has struggled, his sinker-
ball apparently not sinking quite
as much. There was no savior last
year, as the one-rungames were
won by the opposition.

Despite the fact that the starting
pitching is the weak link in the
Pirates’ artillery, a reincarnated
string bean of a relief pitcher such
as Tekulve may just keep the
Pirates playing ball well into
October. Even if the starters are
knocked around, the sizzling Pirate
bats will dictate many late-inning
thrillers—meaning Tekulve will
decide their fate.

Krug Recruits Divers To

Fil|This Year’s Gaps

continued from page twelve
hopes to begin a full time Nautilus
weight program with both his men
and women divers.

Coach Krug’s record speaks for
itself. He coached Navy and Illi-
nois teams for three years each
before coming to Pitt in 1979. He
has been to three Olympic trials
and more National meets than he
can count. He has seen interna-
tional competition as well and is
very up-to-date on new coaching
techniques. He also is a very likea-
ble person and talks agreat deal
with all the divers and coaches with
whom he has come in contact.

Next year is a rebuilding year,
and Krug has begun not only by
signing divers, but by practicing as
well. “There’s a lot to do over the
summer," said Krug. “just this
weekend is the age group prequali-
fications in Clarion, and next week
is Senior Nationalsin Milwaukee.
Summer meets include more pre-
qualification meets and Nationals.
And when we don’t have one (meet)
to go to, we’ll make one ofour own
out at Settlers Cabin. Oh yes, it will
be a very active and learning
summer,” Krug added.

The learning will be done by
those diyersjustjoining Pitt's team
who don’t have a college three
meter list. “Most of them have
meter lists that need little work.
They have their strong and weak
dives. All it will take is spine coach-
ing and some will power," Krug
said.

Coach Krug is especially pleased
with his incoming diyer's atti-
tudes. “Chris Perry and john
Dusch are the kind of men I appre-
ciate coaching. They’re hungry to
le.arn dives and take an optimistic
and adult attitude about their
sport. Their desire and talent will
make them very solid divers," Krug
commented with delight.

Rex Nordheimer, Pitt's lone
diver this year, will return to find
heated competition for his slot.

“The inner team competition
will help in so many ways,” con-
tinued Krug. “They can see others
do dives that they can’t or just do
weakly, and they will want to
improve. The key is ‘they want’
because it will make my job easier
and their diving so much better.

her, I'll have to pick my four best to
represent Pitt, and I hope it's
hard," ‘Krug said.

Coach Krug takes a yery realistic
attitude toward his ‘goal. He can see
that individual attitudes and over-
all team atmosphere can be the best
long term qualities toward obtain-

ing his goal of a National ranking.

“Sure I could go out and recruit a
couple of the best divers I could

find. But we have a very lIlI1IIt‘£{_._ -

scholarship budget, being a non-
revenue sport. My divers are people
before they are divers. ‘I want to see
improvement in their dives, but
personal‘ improvement in their
attitudes toward diving and life is
what will keep them on my team.
I’ni confident in my coaching, so
all I need is men withconfidence in
themselves, and between us, we can
rebuild Pitt to a diving power the
East will respect. My personal goal
is to out score every team at East-
-erns next year, and withthe kind of
divers Isee joining, I know it's pos-
sible,” Krug said. A
' This all may sound implausible

from a team that scored only terry; ‘

and seventeenth from first year
diver Nordheimer at the 1982 East-
ems. But one must look at the
coaching talent of Krug. His best
example this year is his age group
team. The high school men who
trained all winter under Krug, took

I first, third, and fifth at WPIAL’s

while his eight women swept first
through seventh place and twen-
tieth at WPI-AL’s also. Unfortu-
nately none are seniors, and all
remain in high school and on
Krug's age group team for at least
another year.

“The verb TRY worked on the
age group team, now I’ll put it to
work with the large field I have to
work with for next year. As long as
they keep trying and keep improv-
ing, they will belong to the Pitt
Diving Team,” Krug said. ,

Coach Krug sounds every bit as
hungry to start the summer as his
divers do. Krug’s national power
aspirations, and attitudes have not
been diminished because of one
hard year. He has taken a hard-look
at where he wants to go, at who and
what it will take to get there, and he
is emerging into a brand new sea-
son for Pitt with ' very real
optimism. ’

Pirates Out

is just plain bad, and Mark Davis
and Marty Bystrom are inexperi-
enced.

The bullpen, if possible, is worse

yet. Tug “grandslam" Mc(;raw.,

lives up to his nickname. Ron
Reed, at 39, is ineffective and
Sparky Lyle is pondering retire-
ment. Ed Farmer and Mike Proly
may help a little, but Mike Schmidt
will have to hit 100 homers for the
Phillies to have a chance. The trad-
ing of team leader Larry Bowa,
Keith Moreland and Lonnie Smith
won’t help matters.

The Mets and Cubs will again be
watching the playoffs on
television.

It is then clear that the Pirates
may prosper from the weak
National League East——regardles§
of the question marks——and that
the mass of skeptics may be eating
more than those stadium hot dogs
once October arrives.

Swimmers To

Stay Dominant

continued from page twelve

Zaleski, who will be a senior next

year, will be top man as he is a
versatile freestyler who is strong in
the 50- as well as the 200-yard
xevents. Junior-to-be McCrillis has
 a long way under Lewis in
just two years. As a freshman, he
was on a relay, with Zaleski, Carter,
and Scott Shearer, that came
within ten milliseconds of national
qualification. His presence on
Pitt’s Eastern record setting 400-
yard freestyle relay, which went to
Nationals, has him as a high favor-
ite liasterns next year.

Bergan, who broke all the three
Eastern records a backstroker could
possibly break, will return as a

Nationalist for sure next year and

possibly get the All-America status

that a bad stomach flu at Nationals
this year prevented. In just one sea-

son, Bergan established Pitt as the

 , ‘kstroke power to beat.
i Pitt Nationalist butterflier Geoff
Emore will also return next season.
As a sophomore this year, Emore
excelled by moving up six full
notches over his freshman Eastern
standings.

“I want swimmers like Geoff on
next year’s team,” said Lewis. “I
want only those who are commit-
ted and willing to go as far as they
can and help take our team as far as
it can.”

Fortunately for Emore, Mike
Lehto will return to next year's
team as a top butterflier who was
academically grounded this sea-
son. “With Pelton graduating, I'm

glad to have Lehto returning as

 

 
 

Jrﬂ ,
Div

powerful butterflier and long dis-
tance swimmer,” said Lewis. “He
did very well at his first Easterns as
a freshman. As a junior next year,
he will be an unexpected surprise
to teams that have forgotten he’s
still here.”

Pitt may hurt for breaststrokers
next year, but freshman Doug Con-
don finished quite well this year
and, although not as fast as Pid-
geon, he can definitely score points
in not just breaststroke, but the IM
as well.

“We've got top men in breast-
stroke and backstroke returning for
next year," said Lewis. “All we
need is a little more depth here. I'm

looking at a couple of swimmers in

these events, but walk—ons may
prove to be just the added depth
we'll need.”

Lewis is working hard on
recruiting right now, but practic-
ing still goes on. The Pitt Aquatic
Club is already planning a ten day
all-out swimming trip to St. Peters-
burg, Florida, where the mega-
yardage needed for summer Senior
Nationals, and hence, the back-
ground for the regular college sea-
son, will take place.

Next year, the Panthtrs will have
five or six home meets, compared
to the lone one against Kent State
this past season. Home meets will
include teams such as Penn State,
West Virginia, Maryland, and
LaSalle. Coach Lewis is enthusias-
tic and looks forward to a competi-
tive summer to prepare for next
year.

Pitt’s‘hitti.n9 against Penn State was one of the few bright spots in an otherwise
disappointing match for the Panthers, who lost to Penn State Wednesday. _

PSU Routs Pitt Spikers  

continued from page eleven

It was an experience which,
Reilly said, made for a long, quiet
ride home, especially after all the

. talk last week that the Panthers

would give Penn State a good fight.

I “Talk is cheap," Reilly said. “I
thought we were on an upswing
going into the match, but we just
weren’t ready mentally.”

It showed in most facets of the
team’s game. The passing, usually
one of the Panthers’ strongest suits,
was poor, thus killing the Pitt

offense which is predicated on
sharp ballhandling. On defense,
the Panthers committed numerous
positioning mistakes, while Penn
State, according to Reilly, “just
seemed to play flawlessly.”

In an effort to extract a better
performance from his team by the
time Penn State visits Pitt next
week for the league rematch, Reilly
launched the team into a string of
tougher-than—usual workouts
which began yesterday.

“They knew it was coming.
They realized they played pretty

bad. We’re working them hard and
it’s going to stay that way until we
see them (Penn State) again,”
Reilly said.

If the preparation involves some
skinned knees and elbow bruising,

, Reilly is hoping it also yields some

better performances next week.
The hardening of the team might
be the answer.

“We just played basically gutless
ball,” Reilly said. “We just had a
real bad mental breakdown.”

Followed by an on—court
collapse.

Besong Set For

Tough Nationaléii

continued from page twelve

“A bomb could go off while I’m
performing, and I wouldn't even
notice,” Besong said.

His favorite events are the floor
exercise and the high bar. Luckily,
he hasn't been seriously injured
during his career. Besong says you
have to be “a little crazy in this
sport and try anything once, maybe
twice, if it looks good.

“The floor exercise seems to be
the most imaginative and innova-
tive; there are many tricks you can
perform. The high bar is the most
dangerous but also the most fun,"
Besong added.

As do most athletes, he has cer-
tain people he looks up to and
admires for their abilities. Natu-
rally, Kurt Thomas is on the top of
his list and Alexander Ditiatin, a
Russian, comes in second. He said

he looks to Japanese gymnasts for _

their excellent technique and for
specific ways toperform a certain
trick. ‘ '
His coach, Frank D’Amico, has
done much for him and his growth
as a gymnast. Besong says he's
learned many things from
D’Amico, including how to com-
pete harder since high school.
“D’Amico teaches us how to act
like top performers—--in our minds
and in our routines. I've learned
what it takes to be a top classgym—
nast. He’s also a good friend; we
can take problems to him and he's

‘always there to listen,”Bob said.

Bob hopes to find a job some-
where in the field of communica-
tions and plans to become the

assistantcoach for next year’s gym-

nastics team. He plans to stay in
shape and may enter into invita-
tionals sponsored by different col-
leges. Performing in the newly

Bob Besong
established Professional Gymnas-
tics tour may also be something in

his future. it i~.;Kv~
Some dreams come true and oth- ’‘

ers never materialize. Even though
his dream of becoming a basketball
player for the Boston Celtics is out
of his reach, the dream of going to
Nationals is very real for him.

ing by driving two runs in with a

' the Panthers’ return to action today
at 2:30 p.m. against Towson State,
then travels to West Virginia
tomorrow for a doubleheader with

that e the same combination of
pitching and offense that defeated
the Dukes will be needed this
weekend. A __

,“I hope we can hold‘ the other
team , down and to keep on hit-’
ting,” said Lewis. A _

Not a bad combination for any

baseball team.
PITT - NOTES: Yesterday's games
were considered to be Duquesne’s
home games, but since Trees Field
is kept in much better shape than
the Duke’s home field in the West
End, both teams consented to move
the games to Pitt. The wins give the
Panther’s a 2-0 record in the East-
ern Athletic Association...Du—
’quense’s record in now 2-5...Pitt
will have a rematch with the Dukes

Rottndball tonight...

Some of the nation's best school-
boy basketball talent will be show»-
cased tonight in the 1982 Dapper
Dan Roundball Classic at The
Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

In the main event, the United
States All-Stars, led by I 7-foot
Benoit Benjamin and 6-9 Waymon
Tisdale, are heavily favored over.
the Pennsylvania All-Stars. The
U.S. All-Stars have a l3-4 edge in
the all-time series.

Benjamin, a native of Monroe,
La.,ihas been likened by George-
town’s 7-foot freshman sensation,
Pat Ewing. Benjamin averaged 29
points and 19 rebounds per game
this past season, statistics that rank
him as one of the most heavily re-

cruited players in the nation.

 

The Pitt News,iiii1i‘TidiiY. April 2.1932 A

The US. team, which includes
four Parade All-Americans, also
boasts the players rated second best
in the country, Tisdale. The 6-9,
233-pound center averaged 24
points and 16 rebounds per game
this season while leading his
Tulsa, Okla. high school team to
the state championship tourna-
ment. .

Besides the talents of Benjamin
and Tisdale, the Pennsylvania All-
Stars will also have to overcome a
severe height disadvantage. The
U.S. team roster includes ‘eight

players who are 6-6 or taller, while >

the Pennsylvania team boasts only
three. — '
One of those three is C1airton’s

Lloyd Moore, the highly recruited
6-9 center who averaged 30 points

and l7 rebounds this year. Moore,

the target of intensive recruiting

' efforts by both Pitt and Duquesne,

had said he will announce his col-

‘lege choice sometime before the

Roundball game.

The Parade All-Ameriam is sup-
posedly waiting to see who
Duquesne’s new head coach would
be. The Dukes held a press confer-
ence yesterday to formally
announce the hiring of Jim
Satalin, ex-coach at St. Bonaven-\
ture. Moore is now reportedly lean-
ing toward Duquesne.

In the first game, the Keystone
All-Stars will face the Ohio All-
Stars. The Keystone team features
Pitt's first recruit this year, Matt’
Miklasevich, the brother of Pitt
Lady Panther basketball player
Pam Miklasevich. At Franklin
High School this season, he aver-_

aged 21 points and H rebounds.

The 6-6, 215-pound Miklasevich is

projected as a forward at Pitt.
Besides the array of talent on the

court, some of the nation’s top.

coaches will also be in attendance
at tonight's game. john Thomp-
son of Georgetown, loser to North
Carolina in this year's national
championship game, is expected to
attend, as well as Virginia Coach
Terry Holland, Rollie Massimino
of Villanova and Washington
' State’s George Raveling. ,

The first game, between the
Keystone and Ohio All-Stars, beg-
ins at 6:45 pm. with the feature
attraction taking place imme-
diately afterwards. Some tickets
still remain for the games.

St. Joe’s a 

St; _]oseph’s was officially
announced as the-10th and presum-
ably last addition to the Eastern
Athletic Association (EAA), for-
merly the Eastern 8 basketball
league, at a press conference yester-
day in Philadelphia.

St. Joseph’s finished this season
at 25-5, losing to Northeastern in
the opening round of the NCAA
tournament. The Eagles have
advanced to postseason play each
of the last four seasons. Along with,

another recent addition, Temple,»-

the league’s new inroads into Phi-
ladelphia are expected to help the
EAA finally get a television pack- ‘
age together after a two-year stretch
without one. Pitt left the EAA after
this year to move on to the Big East.
The addition of St.. Joe's is
expected to be accompanied by a

‘change in the league’s formatfor,

the regular season ‘play and post-
season championships. The 10
teams are expected to be placed into
an East and West divisions. The
East Division will include Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Rutgers and
recent additions Temple and St.
joe’s. '

The ' West’ Division will j
Duquesne, St. Bonaventure, West
Virginia, George Washington and
the league’s final recent addition,
Penn State. .

With its membership solidified,

the league will now focus on sug-
..gestions that the tournament site

be relocated from Pittsburgh’s
Civic Arena, the moving of the
league offices from Pittsburgh and
the television package.

The Philadelphia Spectrum, the
West Virginia Coliseum, the Provi-
dence Civic Center-and the Mea- C
dowlands Complex in New jersey
have all been mentioned as possi-
ble sites for the championship

tournament. Despite WVU’s push

  

ht?“ 

to have the tournament in Morgan- V R‘ 
town, EAA Commissioner Leland”! 
Byrd has said the league is now
looking at a “non-carnpus” site,
which would rule out the
Coliseum. ’ '

BO0G:That’s right. The field is /t, 11-4~,|:,,

I006: Shortstop?! Very funny. -
