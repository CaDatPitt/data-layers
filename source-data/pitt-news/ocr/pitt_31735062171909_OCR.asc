University Requests Delay

Hillside Dorm Talks

by CAROLE COVAL

At the University's request the
Pittsburgh City Planning Com-
mission agreed Tuesday to ex-
tend the Hillside Dorm talks an
additional 30 days.

The administration asked for
the extension at the suggestion of
Peoples Oakland, which opposes

. its Dorm plans.

According to City Planning Di-
rector Robert Paternoster a deci-
sion on the Hillside Dorms would
have been made Tuesday at the
bi-monthly City Planning Com-
mission meeting had the adminis-
trations request not been made.

Paternoster said that the Uni-
versity also agreed to a 30 day
moratorium on the demolition of
Forbes Field and a 60 day halt on
the active acquisition of any new
property in the Phrase II area of
projected Oakland construction.
Paternoster said.‘ however. that
this agreement would not prevent
the University's purchasing prop-
erty from willing sellers in this
area.

Paternoster said. "Oakland res-
idents asked for a longer discus-
sion time because they said that
they really can't have an input at
this time."

Dan Diven. Oakland Area Mod-
el Cities director, said that a
“joint citizens‘ group from the
Oakland is meeting and will send

a representative member to the
talks."

On March 6, an exploration
meeting was held in Bruce Hall
with the three groups—City Plan-
ning, Oakland residents and Uni-
versity spokesmen—to see how
the Hillside Dorm issue could be
solved.

Diven said. "People's Oakland.
Model Cities. Chamber of Com-
merce. and the South Oakland City
Council are very concerned with
the general expansion of both the
hospital and the University of
Pittsburgh. We feel our input
should have a great deal of weight
concerning further expansion."

Paternoster said that Peoples

DESPITE MUCH controversy, the Circle K Miniest Mini Contest is still

scheduled for Friday night.

lance Chontos, the outgoing Circle K president, said, “The con-
test may still be subject to change, as we have pressure from both
sides. The engineers want the dance and Women's Lib people are

against it."

He stated, “We're willing to discuss the issue but everyone
seems to uptight to talk rationally. Our intentions was only to raise
money for charity as we have done from other projects in the past.”

Due to pressure, the mini-skirt competition at the dance has
been open to both males and females.

“We almost definitely won't have a third annual Miniest Mini

Contest,” declared Chontos.

Some Problems Settled

WPGH Operating, Calm

Broadcasting at campus radio
station WPGH. resumed Monday
after a weekend of silence. con-

tinued through the week without

incident.

The station was closed Friday
evening by then General Manager
Ed Rose who feared racial ten-
sion at the station would erupt and
perhaps endanger staff personal
and equipment. Rose resumed
broadcasting at noon Monday.

Since then. black and white staff
members have met several times
and have settled some of the
points of contention. Standardiza-
tion of WPGH tests and guaran-
teed accessibility to certain sta-
tion rooms for designated person-
nel were two of the points settled.

Left undecided was the matter
of the future of the Black Side of

the station. The Black Side, run

by blacks, is a programming fea-
ture of WPGH geared to the tastes
of campus blacks.

Bill Brunetti. WPGH general
manager. said that though no fur-
ther talks between blacks and
whites were scheduled. all staff
members would be seeking ways
to end the racial differences that
have plagued the station for the
past 18 months.

Brunetti was recently elected
general manager of the station
was not expected to assume that
position before April 1. Former
General Manager Ed Rose resign-
ed that position Monday and Brun-
etti succeeded him.

A meeting has been set for April
1 at which time it is expected that
several amendments to the
WPGH constitution will be dis-
cussed.

tearing it down. He speculated
that this group may approach the
General State Authority (GSA).
the state agency which authorizes
funds and supervises University
construction.

Meanwhile, Paternoster said,

“Mayor Peter Flaherty is very

much interested in the Pitt expan-
sion issue.”

Diven said the Oakland resi-
dents would like to have a mem-
ber of the GSA at the next meet-
ing of the three groups.

“We don’t like to sit back and be
told what’s going to happen." he
said. “I‘m certain there will be

-concessions made by all three

sides."

Committees Project

Film Coordination C

The Student Union Board (SUB).

Social Committee. the Franklin
Pangborn Film Club. and the So-'
cial Commission of the Student
Association have agreed to coor-
dinate future scheduling of mo-
vies.

The decision was made at a
meeting Tuesday night. At the
meeting, the Social Committee
and the Pangborn Club also de-
cided to merge.

“The idea of the merger]; said
LaRue McKenzie. Social Commit-
tee advisor, "is to benefit the stu-
dent by exposing him to a wider
range of films. We want a wide
diversity of films available on the
campus."

The two (SUB Committee and
Pangborn) agreed to cancel the
SUB film, The April Fools. sched-
uled for April 12 in favor of Pang-
born’s film, 2001 2 A Space Odys-
sey, to be shown at 6 and 9 p.m.
April 2 and 3.

The three organizations agreed
to coordinate screening times for
movies and lists of movies to be
shown. These steps were taken to
prevent simultaneous showing of
different films and duplication of
films shown.

The SUB Committee and the
Pangborn Club also agreed to set
aside one Friday of each month

Shapp Addresses Educators

Extravagant Schools Scored

by JOHN WILBORN

Governor Milton Shapp lam-
basted skyrocketing educational
costs Wednesday at the Hilton
Hotel.

Addressing the University Edu-
cational Forum. Shapp suggested
a 12-month school year to hold
down state-supported expendi-
tures.

"Taxpayers are becoming more
reluctant to part with their hard-
earned wages.“ the Governor
stated. voicing the sentiments of
citizens whose tax dollars sup-
port the cost of education pro-
jects.

Shapp also criticized the erec-
tion of expensive new school
buildings by some suburban
school boards and termed the
buildings “Monuments to the van-
ity-of architects and engineers,
rather than to the needs of the
children.”

Educational methods using
practical experience and greater
emphasis on vocational training
are other areas where experimen-
tation is needed to find more ef-
fective ways to teach and learn.
the Governor said.

The capacity to find new meth-
ods of education. in the face of set
funding and rising costs, would
be a “challenge to flexibility." As

the amount of state subsidies has
tripled over the past decade,
Shapp argued that a change of
trend is essential.

GOVERNOR MILTON SHAPP

The Governor also blasted the
national administration’s cutting
down funds for summer employ-
ment as an “extraordinary lack
of foresight.” He expressed con-
cern over the possibility of idle
young hands, which, unless en-
gaged in jobs and education, could

become forces similar to those
which caused cities to “burst into
flames in the mid-sixties.”

He stated that changes to im-
prove educational and check ris-
ing costs are “a challenge to do
things differently and better.”

In a press conference preced-
ing the address, the Governor
commented on welfare, the hand-

ling of state funds, the new state .

income tax, and revenue-sharing
with Washington.

On welfare, Shapp opined that
the department is “the most
grossly mismanaged” in the ad-
ministration. He said the new in-
come tax at first was protested by
those it would least affect, but the
most valid opposition was from
businesses and industry.

Commenting on revenue-shar-
ing. Shapp said that he gladly ac-
cepts all the funds he can get from
Washington but that he has been
disillusioned by certain Nixon
policies.

He added that certain non-es-
sential state jobs are being inves-
tigated in an effort to cut spend-
ing.

While Gainan Simmers

Tom Gainan, head of the Com-
muter Association (CA) regrets
the disappearance of “rap ses-
sions” between students and Vice

 :9 W Chancellor Bernard Kobosky.

The “Coffee with Kobosky" ses-

’ I sions, initiated by the Vice Chan-
$_‘ cellor in January, have apparent-
, _ly been discontinued since the

‘ first two meetings.
‘ In response to a query, G_ary

; gHouston, a member of Vice Chan-
“ c‘el1or Kobosky‘s staff, said. “The

coffees have not been discontin-

. g  uledfg They’ve been curtailed be-
 cause of Kobosky‘s schedule. He's
‘V been out of town a lot.”

;_;3 5 Houston added that the sessions

 would be resumed in the future,

calling them “successful in com-
municating student problems to

" administrators.”

-‘‘'I thought that the sessions

~_ {were _a very good idea,” Gainan
‘~ said,‘ .“student attendance was not
a too good, but I’m sure that it

.would ‘have improved. We were
able to bring a number of issues

“The meetings should not have

that thesesessions worried the

made the administration accoun-

should be,” Gainan added.

    iPieakeiTracesPitt Growth

  From ‘Street-Car College’

by JIM MAC -

Dr. Charles Peake. the Univer-
sity's first Provost. has resigned.
effective August 1, 1971. The sec-
ond highest administrator. Peake
oversees all major academic
units of the University except the
Health Professions. As Provost.
Peake has been the man chiefly
responsible for academic excel-
lence.

In 1956, Chancellor Edward
Litchfield brought Peake to Pitts-
burgh
Galesburg, Ill. Litchfield wanted
an academic man. the Provost ex-
plained, to serve as Assistant

~ ‘Chancellor of Student Affairs.

STREET-CAR COLLEGE

“When I got here," Peake said.
“Pitt was- a street-car college.
Really ba‘ckward. There were no
Admissions or Student Aid Of-
fices, no University Counseling
Service or Placement Center. nor
was there a Student Union. One of
the things I felt had to be devel-
oped was campus life. We had to
make it a rich experience, total
education, the best.“

To transform Pitt into a nation-
ally and internationally recogniz-
ed university, Litchfield, Peake,
and others decided to stress cer-
tain academic areas more than
others. This, the administrators
felt, would both enhance Univer-
sity prestige and set an example
for other departments as to what
could be done in a short time.

According to the Provost the
areas particularly stressed were
anthropology, philosophy and phy-
sics.

Dr. Peake stated. "Pitt had no
anthropology department at all
before I came here. and philoso-
phy was very weak. Today. they
are two of the finest departments
in the country. Both produce jour-
nals which are internationally

recognized; the same is true for
physics."
RESPONSIBILITY TO
MINORITIES

“People say we are lowering
our standards to admit minority
groups,“ the Provost said. “They
don‘t realize the unique capabil-
ities and responsibilities Pitt has
in developing. on professional
ahp graduate levels, minority
peoples. No other institution in
Western Pennsylvania can do
this. We must strengthen these
programs and make them more
productive.

“We are not lowering our stan-
dards, not losing excellence.
Rather we are adapting to get at
the potential present. The Univer-
sity, to survive and be responsi-
ble, must become increasingly
flexible."

Peake asserted that in the fu-
ture the University must make
major changes in all areas, es-
pecially in programs, structure,
and finance.

“New programs," he said.
"must be developed that will build
toward applied work and erode
the barriers between the under-
graduate and master‘s programs.
We must change to a less central-
ized. more individualized. sys-
tem."

“We at Pitt cannot continue to
grow by crowding everyone into
the Oakland area. We need to con-
centrate on the branch campuses.“

Probably the biggest danger to
Pitt and to academic excellence,
Peake feels, is the lack of fi-
nance.

“The‘University is not a fac-
tory. But a lot of people in posi-
tions of power don’t agree or un-
derstand. It’s increasingly hard
to maintain excellence in the face
of continuing fund shortages.
We’ve had a lot of good ideas that
were just not carried out because
of money shortages, particularly
in programs for minority groups."

In August, Peake will leave for
Asia, where he will be special
consultant to the Chancellor of
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. Following a one semester
stay, the Provost plans to tour the
University of Pittsburgh‘s pro-
grams in Asia and then visit Mex-
ico City in June. He will return to
Pitt in one year, as Professor-at-
Large, Provost Emeritius, and
senior assistant with the Univer-
sity Center for International Stud-
ies.

Peake will be replaced as Pro-
vost by Rhoten Smith, now pres-
ident of Northern Illinois Uni-
versity.

Mutiliation Of Materials.

Plagues Hillman Library

by LORETTA HORRELL

Sally Rowley. coordinator of the
Information Center in Hillman Li-
brary. has received several re-
ports concerning mutilation of
magazines, newspapers and books.

"We don‘t know the total extent
of the problem," said Rowley.
“We only know what has been re-
ported. In order for the depart-
ment to total the damaged and
stolen books. a complete inven-
tory would have to be taken.”

Rowley explained that an invi-

tory would be “quite expensive." ’

The more popular magazines
such as Time. Life. New Repub-
lic and Nation are most often se-
lected and destroyed,” said Row-
ley. “Individuals rip the desired
pages out.” Destruction of news-
papers and books has also be-
come a problem.

Citing an example of ruined ma-
terials. Rowley described the con-
dition of a book which was turn-
ed into her. "It looked as if some-
one had deliberately taken a
clump of pages and ripped them.“
she explained.

When magazines are stolen. at-

tempts to replace them involve
time and money. Often the price
of the issue to be replaced has
doubled since it was published or
copies are not available. “\Ve‘ve
even appealed to University peo-
ple. who we thought had subscrip-
tions to specific magazines. to
complete our bounded journals."
said Rowley.

“When articles are missing, we
have to xerox off copies,” Row-
ley added. “We usually use Car-
negie Library’s facilities.”

Controlling the problem. ac-
cording to Rowley. is "impossible.
“It would almost have to be a
one-to-one surveilance. Proctor-
ing the large amount of people en-
tering Hillman every day. about
5.000 a day according to a recent
survey. is an insurmountable
problem.“

In order to regulate the prob-
lem. Rowley said that library of-
ficials will have to rely on “con-
cerned individuals." Rowley said.
"If students would assume some
of the responsibility by reporting
individuals to staff members.

perhaps the problem would not be
so serious.“

by EVAN PATTAK
-Associate Editor

A fragile peace between blacks and
whites at WPGH has enabled the station
to go back on the air. The threat of vio-
lence has been mitigated, and some of
the more obvious differences have been
resolved.

But- the more profound racial schism
and personal vendettas, like Damocles’
sword, hangover the station, waiting to

0 strike at a hint of provocation.

- wron

Eighteen months ago, Vice Chancel-
lor of Student Affairs Bernard Kobosky
agreed to the formation and funding of
the Black Side. It was to be a special
programming section of WPGH tailored
to the listening tastes of blacks on cam-
pus.

Though it was to be manned exclu-
sively by blacks, the Black Side was
'not meantto be a separate enclave with-
in the station. In effect, however, it has

The roots of the racial friction at
WPGH are deep. At a meeting Monday
night, station blacks and whites nego-
tiated some of their more visible squab-
bles—-who gets keys to what rooms, how
tests for staff members are to be admin-
istered, who does the administering.

Monday’s discussion, however, flound-
ered around the autonomy or integra-
tion of the Black’ Side program, personal
acrimony among staff personnel, and
racism. The problems seem to be in-
terrelated.

Bobby Davis, WPGH public relations
director and Black Side General Man-
ager, said he picked up a phone and
overheard a white staff member call
him a “nigger.” Over phones and be-
hind his back, station whites call Davis
many uncomplimentary things.

The station, of course, has its share ‘

of racists. “Some whites totally resent
the Black Side of WPGH,” said former
General Manager Ed Rose. Moreover,

Davis’ outspoken manner_ has won him—

few admirers among staff whites, many
of whom consider much of the recent
trouble the result of a power play on his
part.

If some WPGH white staff members

 

that fear the blacks. The fear is not
groundless. Rose’s decision to close the
station last weekend was promoted by
fear of what irate blacks might do.

Though no direct threat was ever
publicily made, Monday, shortly after
it became apparent that the station would
broadcast, Davis said that he “could not
be responsible if the station is torn down."
Perhaps they don’t constitute a threat,
but those are ominous words nonethe-
less.

It seemed obvious following Monday’s
round of talks that no one was quite
sure where the situation would lead. Mem-
bers of the Black Side themselves appear
uncertain of the direction they wish to
take.

Blacks comprise a voting majority of
the station, yet only two blacks voted
in the recent election of new General
Manager Bill Brunetti and his Executive

. Board.

“Why should .we vote when we can't
win anything,” Davis asked Monday,
but if increased power and influences
within the station are Black Side goals,

/ the election might have been the idea

vehicle. V '
If, however. complete autonomy is

   Station Experiences Stormy Week

little has been said about it.

The problems are complex, immedi-
ate, and ugly. Tuesday morning, a list
of WPGH staff members considered
casualties of the racial tension mysteri-
ously appeared on a bulletin board. Rose's
name was on the list. Staff members
wondered—was it a threatening black who
put it up or a white trying to incrimin-
ate the blacks? '

This is the supercharged, rumor—laden
atmosphere that pervades the station.

Staff personnel are churning the grist
mill for damaging stories about other
staffers. The surface wounds have been
bandaged, but WPGH is hemorrhaging.

And the situation remains volatile. The
station will be able to function, as pos-
sible remedies are explored; and perhaps
the passage of time will ease some of the
rancor. At this point, no one at the sta-

operated independently.

Service to the University

by BOB BONN
Opinion Editor
Salaries for Pitt News staff
members have been controver-
sial since their inception I two
years ago.
To many, it seems that giving
salaries to Pitt News reporters
and editors is an unfair practice,
‘as no other student organization
receives payment for its‘ la-
bors. It~has been argued that if
the Pitt News gets salaries, then
so should the Glee Club and the
Chess Club and the Pitt intramur-
als and everyone else.

But there are reasons why the
Pitt News should be paid.

First, practically everyone
will agree that the Pitt News
serves the University. Covering
everything from academic inno-
vations to play reviews to sports,
the Pitt News is the.most im-
portant source of campus news
for most students and faculty.

' It is in this service aspect that
the Pitt News differs from almost
every other organization. Though
many other groups are helpful

paper, a lot of time has to be
spent on every step. Hundreds
of man-hours are spent on each
edition. . i

Not that this in itself is at all
unique, but remember . . . the
time is spent_ in the service of
the University. A

PAY NOT EXORBITANT

And the pay isn’t any too
great, either. It is possible to
make more money by working
Saturdays at a record shop than
by working from 20 to 30 hours
a week as an Editorial Board
member.

And reporters get paid even
less. No one on the Pitt News
is there to simply make an easy
buck, because it just can’t be
done.

One of the rationales for pay-
checks is for incentive purpose-

4' Pitt News. I hold some of my

es. That is, by using salaries. we
can get the most out of our good
reporters. Payment is based on
how many stories an individual
turns in each month, and report-
ers are inclined to do more if
they know it will result in an
extra $5 at the end.

And believe me. an extra $5 is
about all that can be hoped for.
since_the average reporter on
the Pitt News earns something
like $15 or $20 a month, and the
best get around $35. .

As for editors, payment is made
for a different reason. For them,
the Pitt News does approach a

job. The myriad of duties and

responsibilities of a newspaper
editor are very numerous and
very time-consuming.

Whether or not the editors
should be paid for putting out
the Pitt News on nearly a full-

time basis shouldn‘t even be a

topic for disagreement. Others

icrsity Times

colleagues in the very highest
regard as journalists, and this
is not only my own opinion.

For example, professional jour- _
nalists from the Press, Post-Gaz-iv

ette, and other papers serving as
judges in the Pennsylvania Col-
legiate Press Associations contest
for the best college, stories in
1970 awarded the Pitt News 14
out of 33 possible awards, giving
the Pitt News as many prizes as
the next three highest ‘winners
combined. The competition includ-
ed 18 colleges and universities.

My point is that the Pitt News
has a very talent staff. and that
the paper as a whole is journal-
isticallyi quite good. A denial
of staff salaries would cut back
on quality, as salaries help keep
the staff going through the
month.

SELF-FUNDING

When the quality of the writ-
ing is considered, it can even

‘there are more

Question

be argued that the paying of
salaries saves the students mon-
ey. Each year, the Pitt News
takes in about $50,000 of its $90,-
000 budget through the ads it
sells.

This makes the paper quasi-
corporational, as the ad sales-
men solicit and design the ads.

Without quality writing, how-
ever, this income would not be
generated, taking more money
out of the students’ pockets.

Besides, when writers are paid
for writing for the Pitt News,
the editors are obliged to check
every story before it gets into
print. Poor stories are eliminated’
or greatly improved, since print-
ing them would increase the
writer's pay—an increase that
would be a waste of the students‘
money.

And finally, although it is en-
joyable to those with a writing
bent, putting out the Pitt News
is a damn hard job.

I feel that, with the payment
of salaries, the University will
profit greatly for an expenditure
of only a few thousand dollars
a year. . . very little in compari-
son to the returns. and even less
in comparison to the total Univer-
sity budget. ‘

Admittedly, there could be a
Pitt News without salaries. In
the past, there has been a cam-
pus newspaper _that worked for

‘ nothing but a warm handshake

sometimes and a lot of nasty‘let-
ters to the editor often.

But even a quick comparison
between the Pitt News of three
or four years ago and the Pitt
News of today indicates clearly
the increase in quality.

The elimination of salaries
would just lead to a step back-
wards. \ .

 

the aim of the Black Side, surprisingly

tion deems that likely.

 

Staff Hypocritical, Selﬁsh‘

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

With all respect to the editor,
Bill Gormley, I can see no justi-
fication that anyone on the-Pitt
News receive salaries.

The Pitt News, of course, has
a rationalization for such a plan.
It says that its members sacrifice
time and effort to put out a good
paper for the benefit of the Uni-
versity.

This time they give is finan-
cially and academically damag-
ing to many of them. The argu-
ment goes that the students,
either directly through Student
Government or indirectly through
Vice-Chancellor Kobosky, should
compensate these deserving mem-
bers of the Pitt News.

This rationale is hypocritical
and selfish. For one thing, the
salary scales are not based on

' need but rather on ability, com-

petence, tenure, work loads, etc.

The members of the Pitt News
are working for their salaries,
meaning they’re working for
themselves. It’s not as if we
the students hired the Pitt News
staff. We do not require
bers of the Pitt New
their long hours und ‘
ditions.

On the
staff wri
works as
they wa
hobby, too.-

How do th   attitudes
benefit the campus? But of
course that’s not the question. We
are supposed to ask instead.what
we can do for the Pitt News.

If we were stupid enough to
buy the Pitt News off so they
wouldn't go on strike or shut
down during the spring term, we
would be buying trouble. Next,
we would have Student Govern-
ment members asking for salaries
because they work long hours;
and you know the rest of the bull.

Then MDC and AWS would
make their requests. And by the
beginning of next year, the chess
club would demand that they
should be hired to play tourna-
ments. —

Why not? If we pay salaries
to members of one voluntary stu-
dent organization, why shouldn't
we pay all student organizations?

 

 

‘However, the University was
not set up to be a job market for
professional volunteers. Why
don’t these
teers”, especially in the Pitt News,
wait until they graduate before
they start grabbing for salaries?

Why don’t they wait until
they’re hired by the New York
Times, the Washington Post, the
Pittsburgh Press, or the Boise
News? No, they won’t because
money is sweet anytime, especial-
ly now. '
I guess that is what their “revo-~
lution” is all about.

Before'I stop, though,I do feel
compelled by my humanity to all
beasts of burden to suggest some

.solutions to the Pitt News staff

to help solve their financial

dilemma.

First, my fellow oppressed work-
ers and comrades, why don’t you
learn to organize your time bet-
ter? If your studies are bother-
ing you, ive some of your “de-
voted t' the paper and

,__._e any of the
_, - ~'ost likely you’re
 azy like the rest. of
 on’t you charge five
ts a copy for the paper? Yeah,
ell your paper like everybody
"in the business does.

But, on second thought, that
wouldn’t work‘ because no one
would buy it. Well, ‘why don’t
you cut down on wasted space
like on the editorial page (no
offense, gang).

It's really debatable if any
one except the editorial writers
ever really reads the editorials
anyway. With more space you
could sell more advertising,
make more money, and become
better capitalists.

Though that wouldn't work be-
cause the people who put out
the editorials run the paper. Man-
agement must alway get their cut.

Finally, if none of the above
pleases you, fire me and fill the
above space with obituaries from
the Pittsburgh Press. I hear
they make some money on it.

‘Who Do You
Think You Are?’

Dear Miss ('2) J. Vollmer,

Enclosed is an article from the
current Newsweek which pertains
to the 1971 fashions. As you will
read, Miss Katie Murphy says,
“No girl really wanted to give
up the mini, but she had no
choice. And when she suddenly
saw hotpants coming in, she grab-
bed the first opportunity to have
her legs dangling out again.”

Another manufacturer, Abe
Schrader, says, “We don't control
the ladies. They control us now.“
And to top this the industry can't
get enough of these garments for
such a demanding market.

In your editorial, you stated that
the upcoming mini-skirt dance
was an exploiter of the female
sex. But Women’s Wear Daily’s
(John) Fairchild says, “The
knees are the ugliest part of the
body and a display of flesh does
not make one sexy.”

Now, I don’t know who you ac-
tually are or what you look like,

but next time you print something A

in your newspaper, you better
have all the facts, and I mean all
of them. I didn’t see Circle K’s
side of the story for one thing.

Secondly, in your column you
stated that the Pitt‘ News con-
demns Circle K and this dance,
but truthfully I can't believe the
entire staff of the Pitt News is
against the Circle K and its dance.

Also, unless you are fashion edi-
tor of the Pitt News, your recom-
mendations on what women
should and should not wear should
not be taken seriously by anyone.

 

What gives you the right to tell
the people what they are to do or
to wear? I say you are the ex-
ploiter rather than Circle K. If
you wish to believe in these postu-
lations, that is your business. But
to use your position on the Pitt
News is unfair to the people who
have other opinions.

I'd advise that next time when
you talk about exploitation and
condemnation of a certain group,
you place yourself in the right
perspective.

Sincerely yours,
Robert T. Balitski
Engr., '74

'1 Cscrawl of the Wild

Mr. Gormley: I

As I‘m sure many of my fellow
students have noticed by now,
there is painted on the Pennant
Ave. side of Hillman the slogan
“Sisterhood Is Powerful" in
bright red. This type of artistry is
appearing all over campus all of
a sudden, and I fail to compre-
hend the motives behind such des-
truction and desecration of some
of the more beautiful buildings
here on campus.

There is absolutely no excuse
for such actions, and the persons
responsible should be punished.

To this person, all I have to say
is “you lousy son of a bitch.” But
the sorry part of it all is that an
inscription on the front of the Un-
ion is misspelled: “Your ralism

is "Heart And Head’7

by JAN FRY

When Pitt tennis player. Joel
Hurwitz. was nine years old. his
father brought home a racquet
and informed him he was going
to play. and for the last ten
years he's been playing.

"It‘s a tremendous sport."
stated the native of Lancaster.
Pennsylvania. “I play because I
enjoy it. Tennis combines the
best elements of all the sports-
the physical and mental aspects.
It takes alot of running and alot
of strategy."

While attending __Manheim
Township High School in Lan-

caster. Hurwitz who played num- .

ber one and two singles position.
had a three year 34-3 record — the
same as the team standing. How-
ever he lost different matches
than the team.

As a junior he was ranked six-
teenth in singles in the Middle
States and won the County
Championships‘ in doubles two
years in a row. Also in singles

In the independent category.
Physical Education Club
whipped the Black Flash. 158-60.
No other teams participated.

Charles Smith of the Black
Flash set a new mark in the in-
dependent division with_ a 5.8

second clocking in the low
hurdles. '
Although intramural director

Leo Bemis was disappointed with
the meager turnout of entrants.
he stated that, “There was a lot
of activity there."

The independent soccer teams
will play their first games of
the year on Sunday afternoon
at the Stadium. Originally, the
contests were to be held yester-
day.

Four teams comprise the mini
league.

Szabat Finishes
2nd In Marathon

Dave Szabat. a top two-miler
for the track teamand cross coun-
try squad. placed second in an
endurance race last weekend.

Szabat ran over 11 miles in
the one hour marathon. Carl Had-
field. a former star at West Vir-
ginia University finished several
hundred yards ahead of Dave to
cop first place.

Hadfield lapped Szabat once
on the me-fifth mile track.

The race was run at Mellon
Junior High in Mt. Lebanon.

The Pitt Rifle team will have
four teams of five shooters each
in addition to a girl’s squad led
by Katina Mataras. Their male
counterparts will be led by Bill
Crooks and Bruce Barrett.

In addition to firing a_s teams
each individual will fire individu-
ally. Pitt will have a total of 25

The top shooters in Western
Pa. are Bob Doverspike of In-
diana. Paul Whitworth of Grove
City and Dave Willard of Du-
quesne. All three shoot in the
280‘s which is based on a per-
fect score of 300.

The events begin promptly at
8 a.m. Saturday morning at the
Trees Hall Range and will last

_all.day.

he played the semi-finals in Lan-
caster and Harrisburg and was
runner up in the Middle States
Juniors in Hershey.

Hurwitz. who will most likely
play number one singles this
season. came to Pitt because of
its academic standing. "It was
bewteen Pitt and Clark Univer-

sity." the recipient of a four’

year-half tuition tennis
scholarship explained. "However
Clark was dishonest in their re-
cruiting-they lied about a schol-
arship so I decided on Pitt."

The night before he accept-

ed Pitt's invitation to attend. he-

received an offer of a full ten-
nis scholarship from Temple.
“However. I still decided to
come here." he stated. “I had
written a letter to former ten-
nis coach Ben Pope and he had
replied saying that Pitt had no
interest in me as a tennis play-
er since I couldn't play the top
three. However in choosing col-
lege I wasn‘t looking at tennis
in particular." explained the
political science and economics
major."

Hurwitz, a sophomore, whom

Coach Fran Webster described ‘

an aggressive net match» “My
and head” into a game, plays
an agressive net match. “My
approach to the net is the weak-
est part of my game though,”
he said modestly. “I only play
net when I'm way behind or
way ahead in a game. Last year
when I was behind in the begin-
ning of the match I won by play-

Home Finale 

Due to a cancellation by Carnegie-Mellon's Club team: this‘- 
Sundays game against South Park will be the Pitt Ice -Hockey‘; 

Club's last home game.
The game is set for 7:15 at

Braddock Hills right off of Exit 11 on the Parkway East. '

“I'm really angry that C.M.U. called off the game f'or lApril ii“
4" stated an irate Joe Testa. founder and team. captain. “We're'_. .

really going to beat them next
Wednesday at the Arena."

Testa went on to point out
that there is a game scheduled
for March 31 at the Arena after
the Penguins - Sabres game.
C.M.U. is the host team even
though he game was scheduled
by Testa. It will be the last
game for the Pitt skaters.

In regards to Sunday’s oppon-
ent, South Park, Testa rates them
as “a very good hockey team.
They're better than North Park
which tied us 6-6. However,
we expect to be_at full strength
for this game so it should be a
good close checking game.”

The team is again experiencing
difficulties with the Student
Association. Testa made a re-
quest for an emergency alloca-
tion several weeks ago but has-
