Fear is what Communism means
toymiany unfortunate people caught
behind the. Iron Curtain in this
uneasy world of today. ‘

To Dr. Josef Macek, an exiled
anti-Communist, and a lecturer of
economics at the University of
Pittsburgh, the Red curse means
much more. A

While Dr. Macek lived under
the Communist rule, he learned
much of their vicious » tactics.
These are some of his experiences
with Communism in Czechoslova-
kia.

The date was Feb. 25, 1948.

American newscasters announced-

that the Communists had taken
over the Czechoslovakian govern-
" ‘M-acek and thirteen

 

  

years. .

_ The Communists immediately
began‘ a Wave of_ terror, and col-
lege studgnts were the ﬁrst targets
of oppression.

At the University of Prague,
said Di‘. Macek, a young student
was about to complete his medical
studies. He was denounced as.a
person of anti—Communist lean-
ings and on the basis of this accu-
sation was not allowed to graduate.
Instead, he was deported .to a
uranium mine where he works
today. ‘

. Instructors were also purgeel.‘ In
the graduate school of Commerce
at the University of Prague, ‘said
Dr. Macek, there gwas not a’ single-

   

  
  
   

was not one to replace them, and

so the government had to abolish __

the ‘school. V

A students “free time” is “do-
nated” to the government. On
weekends and during‘ vacations,
“voluntary” brigades of college
men work in agricultural and in-
dustrial centers. 9

Even women students are forced
to contribute their time, Dr. Macek
said. They labor ‘beside strong

men in rolling mills, foundries and _

on railway construction. Perma-
nent physical injuries to these
women arefrequent. ’ '

He served in this capacity nine¢

yearsuntil Dr. W. R. Farmer, the
Chapel’s chaplain, vacated that
post and Dr. Brittain took over the
job as temporary chaplain. He
had been teaching several courses
in history along with the job as
assistant chaplain, now he accept-
ed the duties of , running Heinz
Chapel ‘and continuing teaching.
As he put it, “this was two full
time jobs.” '
Relieved This.Fall

The “temporary” job stretched
out to ﬁve years until this fall
when a full time chaplain was
found and Dr. Brittain was asked
to give up the post he had grown
to love. ' .

However, the handsome, "digni-
ﬁed ‘Dr. Brittain brushed aside this
action of the administration with
the words _“I am sorry not to be
active as chaplain any longer but
the Chapel does need a man who
can devote his full time and I am
kept busy with my history classes.”

Of these duties marriage cere-
monies were his favorite. Dr. Brit-

A students were asked to indicate as

“most inﬂuential in determining
your vote,” that of foreign policy
was the predominant one for both
Eisenhower and Steven support-
ers. _ -
Nearly onelout of three‘ of the
Eisenhower supporters considered
corruption as the most inﬂuential

‘issue; approximately the same
-.proportion of the Stevenson voters
rated prosperity as the most in-

ﬂuential issue... ‘ ~
Neither inﬂation nor taxation
were indicated as important issues
by supporters of either candidate.‘
Students favored all Republican

John C. Arnold, Republican nomi-

But equally Dr. Brittain has a
keen’ attraction for history’ and
“the lessons it teaches." Although
there had been a subject called’
History of Religion taught here for
some time before he came, Dr.
Brittain actually organized the
course and along with this history
he teaches History of Civilization
and Ancient history. _

Now that he is no longer con-
nected with the Chapel he plans
to catch yp on his writings which

have been sadly neglected, accord-

Commenting on the beauty of
Heinz Chapel, Dr. Brittain pointed
out the windows, which attract
many tourists. “The windows”, he
said, “are the most dramatic phase
of the Chapel. They have so much
aesthetic quality and beauty in
them that -they are stories in them-
selves. I used to like to watch
them change their moods—-on sun-

acted as though they were alive.”

A drama of conflict, love and
pathos, ‘The Heiress,’ takes place
in Washington Square, New York

dazled by the attention of the

the ﬁrst romance in her life to see
he is not drawn entirely by her

Her father opposes the marri-
age and threatens he‘ will disown
Catherine if she marries Morris.
Knowing his bride’s father will
withhold her money, Morris
abandons Catherine on the night
of-their planned elopement.

He returns two years later and
again proposes to Catherine, now
wiser and embittered. Her ﬁnal
decision is a suspenseful curtain

For some reason or other, the

On one occasion during Polit-

Purdy’s departure came at the

What’s the matter with people
around here?

We make an attempt to,ob-
tain special privileges for stu-
dents and they either don’t real-
ize it’ or show such a lack of
interest that makes you wonder
whether its ~
all worth the
trouble.

For over a
m o n t h , ‘The _
Pitt News and ‘
Student Con-
gress have ad-
v o c ated the 
a d In ission of
wives of stu-
dents to the. .

games for a reduced price. When
_we started this idea, we believed
that we were backing a project_
which students would favor. Now

we’re not so sure. _We ‘gained a J

temporary victory for the stu-
dents when Captain ‘Hamilton
permitted wives of students to
sit with their spouses at the
games for a small fee. This was
revoked when the Athletic Com-
mitteemet and decided the idea
-would “disrupt the original pur-
pose of the Student Section and

    

prove ﬁnancially detrimental to
the Athletic Program.”

During the weeks of legisla-
t i o n , conferences, interviews, ’
nasty columns and equally nasty
unstated remarks, only one stu-
dent had the guts to express his
opinion in Student Congress and
one alumnus wrote a letter to the
News.

Cause To Wonder

Whether this lack of response.

was due to lethargy,‘ disinterest,
or just a _case of chicken—heart-
edness, we cannot say; but we
can state that student, opinion

« ‘an idea accepted by the students

is little short of heart—wa.rming;
to be criticized and rejected is
hard, but can be taken in stride;

’ chose to ignore the issue or ex

press little feeling one way or

lose faith in the population and ,

build a castle of "cynicism about

Indiana Win Uncovers ,

Double-Punch Offense

By RUSS

FRANKE

Panther followers who thought they saw the last of
single Wing power football when the T—formation was adopt-
ed by Pitt realize by now that _Red Dawson is not going to
let the old system die or even fade away.

. Last Saturday’s victory brought out promise of the

‘varied offense which Dawson hopes to install and which

will get a real.test at Columbus this week when the Blue-

and-Gold tackles Ohio State. 0

Indiana got a sample of it as
the Panthers set in motion a single
wing series and stormed to the
goal line before the game was
three minutes old. Up till then
Dawson had been using it mostly‘
to draw the opposition offside for

a ﬁve—yard gain.

Iowa-Upset OSU A

The Buckeyes themselves saw
all the single wing they cared to
two weeks ago when the Iowa
Hawkeyes, Pitt’s ﬁrst victim, dealt
OSU its second loss.

But they’ll be ready for anything
when Pitt rolls into town, for the
two schdols have always felt a
keen rivalry. And since both
teams won last week, interest has
run high enough to indicate that
some 80,000 of the grid faithful
will be on hand at Ohio Stadium.

Buckeye Coach Woody Hayes
will have his boys up for the con-
test if only to avoid risking a
mediocre season in his second year
at OSU, where the coach’s oﬁice is
equipped with a revolving door.
Last year his record was 4-3-.1.

Borton New QB

This year Hayes instituted some
radical changes in his backﬁeld
which have brought encouraging
results.

John_ Borton, freshman line-
backer last year, has turned out to
be an accurate quarterback while

former signal-caller'Tony Curcillo‘
is now backing up the line.
Captain of the squad is Safety

-Bernie Skvarka, who understudied

V'J

   

 

‘ Skvarka

Hayes

back John Haly, who.loca1 fans
may recall as a sturdy linebacker
in last season’s 16-14 win over
Pitt, is the team’s leading ground
gainer. »
Hoosiers Lose 25

In the Panther ground depart-
ment, Right Halfback Billy Rey-
nolds stepped off 79 yards against
the Hoosiers to maintain his 6.2
average, while Bobby Epps led for
the day with 104 yards.

Although Quarterback Rudy
Mattioli completed only three
passes Saturday, he piled up 49
yards in seven tries as a ball car-
rier.

Teddy the Weed
Kicks Up Grass ~

va

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

There’s a fullback on the Ohio State squad thatnmight
give Pitt a hard time Saturday. He doesn’t do much run-
ning——except hustle his 128—pound frame on and oﬁ the ﬁeld
several times a game. 

Even then he has less than» ten minutes actual playing
time to his credit this year. And he doesn’t do any passing,
either. Off the ﬁeld he throws ‘
an_ occasional pass at the girls.
But- his passes are only effective
if the girl scales under ﬁve-foot-
ﬁve—his vertical proportions.

How then can a little squirt
like Thurlow Weed bother the '3 .~ 1
Panthers? Simple. Taddyl the ":1 _
Weed will kick over their heads. ’ . - '

_ Tad is the place-kicking - -H. 1_,m,..f,,¢" ,
fspecialist for OSU this year ‘ ‘

   
  

' camped

.. and the diminitive sophomore stole the hearts from a North-
western partisan crowd last week with his game winning 17'-
yard ﬁeld goal that climaxed a fourth quarter drive. _

All of his fullbacking chores are attemptedbehind a monstrous
line that must protect “the little toe” from being crushed to ._,even

' smaller ‘proportions. Never does he stray. outside his protective. cup.

Tad also. has the rule book in his corner sinc‘§ roughing any kicker»
draws a 15-yard penalty. '

I hate to think, though, what the consequences would be. if
“little Lou Palatella” happens to brace a fall by sitting on Tad._

- So far he has kicked-.15 extra points and two ﬁeld goals. In

. practice, though, they boast that “the little toe” with his left foot

has kicked over 200 consecutive conversions. Coach Woody Hayes

has yet to use him as a runner——a task he attempted at Grandview ~

High in suburban Columbus. - -

We’re also informed that Mr. Weed is “by far the shortest and
lightest man on the squad.” .
, There was another gridder who interested football. fans
with his_ kicking a few years back. Gene Simmons, a drop kick-
ing ace, booted them for West Virginia. and was quite successful.

_ In three years he split timber. 79 times plus four ﬁeld goals.
Simmons did a little more_ than“kick; In 1949, for example, Gene,
naked, as far as gridders go, without shoulder pads, carried the"
ball once. He gained three yards on that try. Passing was a different
story, though. He " attempted .three—-one was incomplete and the
other two were intercepted. ' _ . , .
Simmons-wasn’t much bigger than Weed, but his 147-pound
frame at least gave him more right to a football suit than the OSU
product.- »

Don’t be surprised if some
day rifles become an accesso-
ry of" women’s fall fashions.
No, they’re not returning to
the ‘wild west days when
“gun totin” was a‘ must, nor is
there any immediate danger of
women being drafted.

But it seems that in some col-
leges—-like Pitt—the establishing
of coed riﬂe teams is a‘ current fad.

And Dean Helen Rush’s girls,
inquisitive and willing, jumped to
organization after Duquesne_ coeds
challenged them to a match. Find-
ing no Pitt girl’s team, the Duch-
esses took "on the Pitt varsit

One of the problems of ROTC
Sgts. -*John Kellerman and Paul‘
Bryan is teaching the girls to ﬁre
from three different‘ positions. Sgt.
Kellerman» claims that a good
prone shooter is as good from that
position as standing-and kneeling.

Ladies will be ladies, however,

and they ’complain. The gals frown
on the kneeling position which

they claim. will result in scrub-~

woman’s knees. Standing position
is not conducive, either, since the
girls aren’t always at their steadi-
est following the preceding night’s
activities. '
Hunt Dears

Strong advocate of the ' prone
position is Sharpshooter Norma
Jurso, blonde, blue—eyed Munhall
lassie, who makes watching riﬂe
practice quite interesting. She’d
make a bullseye in any man’s
league especially if she keeps scor-
ing 99 of 100 as she did last week.

Harriers Await Ohio State

lnitial Defeat

_. By DAVE MAZER

Smarting under thedefeat handed them by Syracuse and Army,
the Panther harriers are preparing to meet Ohio State at Columbus
Saturday in a return engagement. ‘

I_n a previous match against the Buckeyes, the Blue-and-Gold
easily won, 16-47. However, Coach Charley Beetham of OSU pre-
dicted after the meet that his squad would give a better showing

on its home course‘.

Meanwhile, Coach Carl Olson is
working his team hard to get them
in shape for the Ohioan’s course.
The match will
be run over a
golf c o u r s e,
which is al-
most complete-
ly level, the op-
posite to what
the Panthers
are accustom-
ed. - ‘

Olson would
not alibi for the
Pitt defeat at
West Point last
Friday. He said, “every team has
its ups and downs, and this just
wasn’t one of our better days.”

Bernie Luterancik, the team
captain, was the only Pitt runner
to place in the top ﬁve at the Army
Academy when he ﬁnished the
ﬁve-mile course at 26:57.

Histime ‘was 20 seconds bet-

enough for ﬁfth place. ’

Further evidence of the strength
of Syracuse and Army is the fact
that ‘Dan Sommer with 27:21 and
Dick Weber with 27:40 only gar-
nered' eleventh ahd fourteenth
places, respectively, while also
besting their previous lows.

The defeat ended the harriers
eleven-meet win streak which had
carried for two years.

atore and End John Stock once .,

to converting twice.

Besides impressive play on the” ,’

part of the backs, the Cubs show-

ed a powerful and aggressive line. ‘ '

Although the ﬁnal game is to be
played at home against Bullis

Prep, Nov. 15, Pitt rooters are not -

destined to pass up the varsity
clash with North Carolina State
