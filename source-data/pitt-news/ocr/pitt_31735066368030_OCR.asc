Students looking for sources of
financial aid might be lured by
scholarship service companies that
supply-—for a price—computer
compiled lists of available aid.

In some cases, the price may be
reasonable, but resouceful students
can find similar information on
their own.

“Basically, we do financial aid
research. Students could do this
themselves, but they usually lose
patience before they’ve exhausted
all resources,” said Rick Wells,
president of Student Scholarship

percent received some amount of
financial aid as a result of informa-
tion provided by his company.

He claimed that his scholarship
service has better information than
the typical financial aid depart-
ment; his information is more
timely, his lists are more compre—
hensive and he can give students
individualized information.

According to Dan May, director
of Pitt’s financial aid office, stu-
dents can find scholarship infor-
mation for themselves through the
office.

_ ing individual scholarship sources

 

That service is a Furlong, Pa.,
based operation that guarantees a
minimum list of five undergradu-
ate financial aid sources for a pro-
cessing fee of $40.

Nader Urges Consumer
Activism at Pitt Lecture i

By RAY WUSLICH

Consumers have to change the
way they view the economy if they
want to improve the quality of pro-
ducts and industries, consumer
advocate Ralph Nader said last
night.

Nader said consumers must look
at the economy from a buyer’s
point of view and evaluate pro-
ducts not by how well they sell, but
by their impact on _ present and
future generations.

Consumers, Nader believes, see
products from a corporate perspec-
tive. Cereals for example, are sold
because they are sweet, colorful and
loaded with flavorings, rather than

for their nutritional value. People
who buy hot dogs rarely know

what's in them. V , _ _
“ You should know what s inside

that pink missile before you _buy
it,” Nader said, noting that hot
dogs are extremely low in nutri-
tional value. He said college stu-

could yield financial help or more
information. I

In the career library, located on
the third floor of Schenley Hall,
students have access to “The Col-

dents are also demonstrative of this
attitude when they buy junk food
from vending machines.

“That’s an insult to intelligence
and to what a campus should stand
for,” Nader said. “That‘s the kind
of food that kills off wildlife."

Students also buy educational
services, and they have a right to
look at the quality of that service,
Nader said. He noted that in 1974,
Pitt’s Board of Trustees refused to
allow students to form their own
student-run public interest
research group. Such a group
would have been similar to groups
in 24 other states that work to stop
pollution in city rivers while
initiating other projects.

Students have the opportunity
while in school to develop the
skills needed to change things, but
“how many rights are you using,”
Nader asked. He said that less than
30 percent of eligible students
voted in 1980.

Students are supposed to go to
become “informed and effective

lege Blue Book.” This five-volume

text provides general information 4

on over 3,300 institutions of higher
education.
The third of these volumes.

citizens," but instead many schools
are becoming vocational schools,
Nader said.

Students might find major rami-
fications “if they changed the
standards they hold for one
another, Nader said.

“You are the young people who
can question the unquestioned,
who can challenge the unchal-
lenged,”Nader said. “Don’t say,
‘Gee, I wonder if I’m good enough

for Westinghouse,’ say, ‘Gee, I‘

wonder if Westinghouse is good
enough for me.”

‘Nader urged students to “have
fun with their placement office” by
asking recruiters if “I can bring my
conscience to work with me” and
questioning procedures for report-
ing company corruption.

In addition, Nader said people
have to stop being “passive consu-
mers” and fight to change the sys-
tem. He cited cable TV V and
communications in general as
being controlled by conglomerates

Draft Registration and the Alternatives

By PEGGY FERRI '

The General Accounting Ofﬁce's

tﬁtest ﬁgures show that over 700,000

young men have not registered for
the draft. This is more than 20 per-
cent of the entire Federal prison pop-
ulation.- The government means
business and has mailed over
33,000 warning letters since August
to those who have'not complied and
has also recently begun prosecuting
non-registrants. So far, three non-
registrants have been prosecuted.

This week's Forum focuses on
draft registration and the alternatives.

Betty Alexander

,QPubl'ic Affairs Official

Of the Washington D.(:,
Selective ‘Service

Betty Alexander, public affairs ofﬁ-
cial of the Washington D.C. Selective
Service said that registration would
save 6 to 8 weeks from the time it
takes to train and mobilize if the need
occurs.

"Registering is a requirement of
law," Alexander said. “We are here at
this office to see that people comply
and register. The registration's aims
. re to register everyone, not just a

' ,» w because it wouldn't be fair to

others," according to Alexander.

“We don’t want to have anyone
prosecuted," she said ,but added

Forum:

that when persons do not comply
with the law, that is the consequence.

In order to step up public aware-
ness Alexander said that the‘Selec-
tive Service has begun an
“aggressive public information
campaign. The Service is planning
for another mailing soon that will be
larger than the August mailing of
over 33,000 warning letters. In addi-
tion 20,000 mailings will be delivered
to colleges and high schools to make
registration requirements known.

"We are trying to get a hold of the
high school dropouts also," she
explained, “They are a group that is
hard to reach because they are no
longer involved in school and don’t
receive the information we send to
schools." She added that the Service
is also exploring the possibilities of
putting posters in fast food chains,
video arcades and in general places
where these people “hang out."

The methods are not cheap, but
they are not expensive either, accord-
ing to Alexander. She said that the
service spent somewhere in the
neighborhood of $250,000 last year

and admitted that she is not sure how
much this year's effort is going to
cost.

“It is better to be prepared," Alex-
ander said referring to the need for
registration. “The way to avoid con-
flict is by being prepared." In reply to
contentions that registration for the
draft is preparation for war or that the
draft will be reinstated, Alexander
said that everybody has a different
philosophy and added that the draft
only follows if Congress authorizes

, one.

Lysbeth Borie, Public Education
Director for the Philadelphia Central
Committee for Conscientious Objec-
tors (CCCO) is engaged in a nation-
wide effort to inform people about
conscientious objection and related
peace issues. Those who the govem-
ment has prosecuted as public non-
registrants have shown that they
believe it is not enough to avoid regis-
tration, but-that the question has to
be confronted, according to Borie.

Conscientious Objector (CO) sta-
tus is different from non-registration,
because the CO has moral, legal or
ethical objections to participation in
any war. On the current registration
forms, there is no room space pro-
vided for a CO to declare his beliefs,
although no one can really apply for
CO status unless there is a war.

If the draft was reinstated, the indi-
vidual would have 10 days to com-
plete putting together a case
conﬁrming that he has objected to
war of any kind, according to Borie.
“If an individual wants to be a CO, he .
has to have his claim well docu-
mented and that includes letters
from people who know him and his
moral beliefs," Borie said.

As to why the numbers of those
who have not registered have
swelled, Borie said that she can only
speculate.

“One reason could be that people
didn’t realize that they had to register
and they will be registering soon in
drips and drabs," Borie explained.
Another reason could be that the
governments authority has become
less legitimate in the eyes of these
people and they now have less "blind
faith" in government, according to
Borie.

“People are stepping back and
questioning," Borie added.

Bob Seeley, editor of the CCCO
newsletter said that he sees the ques-
tion not as whether the law needs to
be enforced, but whether the law is a
good one.

“There is no need for registration,"
Seeley said. “It gives the Pentagon
computer some exercise and makes
certain that it works." He further
explained that the scenario most
used is that of a large land war in
Europe and that the ﬂaw lies in the
reality of this scenario.

“In war, the government is assum-
ing that 400,000 replacements will
be needed in the first few weeks and
people are in effect being prosecuted
for not adding their name to a list that
will never be used because of the
possible use of ﬁeld nuclear wea-
pons in an escalating war,” accord-

» ing to Seeley.

“The real effect of the draft regis-
tration is that the draft becomes 
usual part of American life again,"
Seeley said. The ironic side effect of
access to great numbers of regis-
trants, according to Seeley, is that
without access to them the govern-
ment would actually be less likely to
need them for "adventures” like the
one in Vietnam.

Specterspeaks on Arms Race...

By BILL HESS

Sen. Arlen Specter (R—Pa.)
may not have found what he
was looking for when he came
to_ the Pitt campus yesterday.

Specter said the purpose of
his visit was to meas_ure campus
interest in arms reduction, but
fewer than 50 people showed up
at David Lawrence Audito-
rium.

Specter, however, said he
plans to hold similar sessions
on Pennsylvania campuses this
year because “with an issue as
important as the arms race, it’s
important to have a maximum
public effort.”

He said that Americans must
create an arms reduction policy

aimed at lasting well into the
next centur '.

In terms of the United States’
position on arms reduction. and
control, Specter said that he
feels the U.S. must assert itself
strongly enough to curb Soviet
aggression and military
expansion.

“We must be strong militar-
ily and bold diplomatically,”
he said, adding that the U.S.
should approach the Soviets by
“speaking rationally, with
intensity,” when expressing its
position on ending the arms
race.

One positive sign, Specter
noted, is that the Soviets have
been showing more interest in
recent years in negotiating arms
limitation than they have in the
past.

‘‘However,’' he said, “I don't
believe the Soviets are going to
give anything away, nor should
we expect them to.

“I. do not propose that the

U.S. give anything away,
either,” he added.
Specter expressed concern

about the United States’ posi-
tion on nuclear war. He said
that while he firmly believes no
one could win such a war,
because it would wipe out
human civilization, he fears/ég
that other governmental offi-
cials may have different views.

“I see no evidence that there’s
a (governmental) plan to wage
and win a nuclear war, but I'm
concerned about that kind of
mentality in official circles. I
think it has to be monitored and
opposed,” he said.

“We’ve got an enormously effec-

we can’t have a voice there,” Nader
said.

For example, he said, it took a
long time for the nuclear freeze
movement to gain recognition
because controlling media interests
didn’t want it covered. When
Nader mentioned nuclear scientist

For the future. Nader said scien-
tists have a “gee whiz” attitude
about genetic research. Because
there are so many risks involved in
that research, scientists should
either be willing to accept possible
liability or allow the public input
into the decision-rnaking.

   

Nader added that corporations

research that should be done for the
greatest good of the greatest

At the conclusion of his speech,’
Nader urged students to become
involved in consumer activism as a
career.

“You’ll find a greater degree of
personal happiness,” Nadar said.
Instead of going through life
bored, powerless, feeling alienated
...you can bring your conscience
with you."

“This is the critical time to make
when you can make the kind of

Even More
    Than Meets
Their Eyes

The compliance rate with draft registration is
below what was expected. Figures released by
the General Accounting Office show that there
are over 700,000 _non-registrants out there,
somewhere.

What is being done?

Warning letters are being sent out, posters
tacked up and the trials begun.

Obviously the reason people aren’t register-
ing is that they don’t know they’re supposed to,
right? Admittedly, that is the reason for some,
but not for all. Note the three individuals prose-
cuted by the government and the 13 other non-

_ registrants who have been indicted.

The Selective Service is moving on a public
awareness campaign that will try to reach peo-
ple who haven't registered by putting posters in
video game arcades and fast food stops. There
are also plans to send out more mailings in the
form of postcards at the cost of about 14 cents
apiece. '

In fact, when one calls the Selective Service in
Washington D.C., the first thing he hears is a
taped message telling him how everything is
running smoothly, boasting a registration rate
that will continue to rise.

This makes sense assuming that the reason so
many have not registered is simply that they are
not aware of it. '

If that doesn’t do the job, there was a law
passed that requires male college students ap-
plying for grants and loans through the govern-
ment to prove that they have registered for the
draft. The constitutionality of this amendment
to the Defense Authorization Bill is already
being questioned. Incidentally, the law goes
into effect in June 1983.

One draft register was recently quoted as say-
ing that such efforts on the part of the govern-
ment show what.- a failure the registration
program is if it has to go outside of the existing
laws to enforce it.

Something doesn’t wash here.

Why are such laws needed to enforce what
used to be considered a duty?

Perhaps the reason posters, television and
radio spots are needed and perhaps the reason
the Selective Service needs help from the IRS
and the recent legislation is there is more to
registration resistance than ignorance of the
law. Maybe the refusal is grounded more_in
moral, ethical and religious considerations
than they think.

PittRushing: ATravesty if

By MARK A. SINDLER

OK, the news is out. Irealize that
I have probably been labeled with
_every name in the book and that
most Pitt Greeks, from the rushees
to the alumni are currently devis-
ing new techniques of mutilating
the human anatomy.
The verdict has been decided-
Sindler is guilty on all counts.
Although this is the impression
discerned by this defendant, the
plaintiffs are knocking on the
wrong doors in the halls ofjustice.
The charge leveled against me
would not float on water because
those Greeks who choose to defame
my name and speak their minds
(although I know a void exists
betwwen their ears) on these pages
have bungled the whole issue.

As a transfer student, yours truly
was privileged to experience rush-
ing and pledging programs at
another school, I am not exactly on
the outside looking in. lam trying
to make heads and tails of the chaos
called the Pitt IFC Rush Program.

Yeah, maybe the other rush-
pledge program I encountered
could be compared to the city char-
ter of a village in the Congo, but
this much is certaiii—that school's
administration stipulated that

freshmen must adjust to college.

scholastic requirements in the fall
semester before pledging.

Thus, students spent the weeks
with their books and the weekends
with drinks in hand. They did not
spend three or four weeks consum-
ing booze in a new environment.

Face it, given the rush time here,
equal time can’t be devoted to stud-
ying and partying. One of the two
will suffer. Should I repeat this or
is it slowly penetrating?

The long-term financial effects
of rushing at this previous school
of mine were minimal. Given that
fraternities, usually of about 30
members, assessed brothers $135
per semester, weekend theme par-
ties were quite realistic through
November. Four to five kegs per
weekend kept freshmen coming in
droves.

Sorry, girls, this “crafty under-
miner” does not have figures avail-
able on sororities for what it would
take to keep keg parties afloat.

Moving on, it is obvious that
Greeks at Pitt cannot define the
word “committee.” For the unini-
tiated, it denotes a group of indi-
viduals who act on certain matters.

If committees were appointed in
each fraternity and sorority to deal
with various matters throughout
the year, including Greek Week fes-
tivities, wouldn’t operations run

more smoothly. This would alle-
viate the problem of “educating
pledges and having less time to
devote to charities.” Again, I hope
most of this is penetrating some
nerve centers.

. One more point: It is utterly rid-
iculous to believe that a rushee can

3 be observed over in one month and
‘accurately determined to have the

necessary qualities of being a
Greek. Especially when there are
“...six parties in II days.”

This sounds like getting married
within ll days after having gone
out six times. The marriage would
not be a true one.

Understand,_ I wholeheartedly
believe in going Greek. I partici-
pated in and supported blood
drives, intramural competitions
and philanthropic charities.

However, those Greeks not deal-
ing with a full deck have blown my
suggestions for a reorganization of
the Greek rush system out of pro-
portion. I did not critique the

.Greek societies—only their rush-

ing policies. «

I criticized the rushing methods
and rightfully so. They ultimately
undermine the freshman’s desire to
benefit from a fulfilling Greek
experience. Rushing at Pitt is a
travesty.

Court adjourned.

Tricks Mom Never Taught You

By RON MATUSOF

Recruiting season is upon us.
Not recruiting for the football team
or the basketball team, but the real

‘ thing: corporate recruiting. It’s the

time of year when various compan-
ies visit college campuses looking
for new employees. But the place-
ment office tells us that fewer com-
panies are coming to Pitt this year,
and those that are coming are hir-
ing fewer people. With this
thought in mind, here are several
methods used by Pitt students to
help them obtain that elusive job:
0 Hire a skywriter: Your resume
printed in the sky will be sure-fire
method of getting noticed. Person-
nel managers are impressed with a
prospective employee's initiative,
and by golly, this shows initiative.
0 Make yourself visible: One of
the best ways to do this is to makea
pretty banner for a nationally tele-
vised football game. Be sure to use
certain catch phrases like “Pitt and
ABC No. 1" and “English writing
major seeks employment, call...”
0 Offer a cash rebate: Everyone

- likes to get something for nothing,

so why not? Be sure to include a
clever tag line on your resume like:
“Hire a grad—-get a check.”

0 Offer a premium: This is an
old trick originally used by gas sta-
tions (when gas cost 32 cents a gal-
lon) and more recently by banks.
Offer a ten dollar calculator if you

get hired for less than $15,000, a’

toaster for less than $20,000 and so
on. After all, if you get the job, you
can write it off as a business
expense.

0 Demand an outlandish salary:
Many employers like to see how
prospective employees rate their
abilities. If you demand a ridicu-
lous salary, like $40,000 for an
entry-level teaching job, many
employers will be impressed and
hire you.

0 Show important contacts:
This is a very old trick. List referen-
ces that you don't really have, such
as the President of the United
States, your governor or Slim
Whitman. This will impress the
personnel director to no end, and
nine times out of ten, they never
check your references anyway.

I Call the president of the com-‘

pany long distance, person-to-
person collect and demand a job:
Aggressiveness scores points when
looking for work, and this cer-
tainly‘ is aggressive. Calling the
president person-to-person collect
makes ‘your call seem important,
and you will be transferred to his
office immediately.

0 Crash someone else’s inter-

view: This also shows aggressive-
ness, as well as resourcefulness, and
you are guaranteed an interview.
There is one problem: If you do it
incorrectly, you may also be seeing
a police officer, a judge and a pro-
bation officer.
. 0 Build an image: This isa ploy
often used by network television.
Hire a public relations firm to sell
you to a company. Make sure they
send out a biography, along with
an 8 X 10 glossy and a slickly pro-
duced five minute sales pitch on
videotape.

0 Run for political office: In the
long rim, it’s cheaper than sending
out all the resumes, requires little
or no experience and pays better

_thaii any other offer you will get.

Arthur Dent, his friend, Ford
Prefect, had revealed himself to
be an alien and warned him 12
minutes before the destruction.
They managed to snag a ride
into the far reaches ofithe gal-
axy and into an assortment of

es‘) ‘

incredible adventures, any of
which would take too long (and
lose much) to discuss here.
Nevertheless, after running
into Zaphod Beeblebrox, who
has stolen the most advanced
spaceship ever devised, (The
Heart of Gold, powered by the
Improbability Drive), they find
that they are on the run from
the Vogons and nearly eve-
ryone else in the galaxy. As
Hitchhiker's Guide ends, our
heroes are on their way to The
Restaurant at the End of the Universe,
where the floor show is nothing
less than the total destruction
of the universe.

Restaurant picks up where
/Guide leaves off and is a further
account of the strange beings
and sights which exist through
the cosmos. Arthur Dent is still
trying to comprehend what is
going on, I-‘ord Prefect is taking
it all in, and Zaphod Beeblebrox
is searching for the man who
runs the Universe so he can ask
him something he can't quite
remember.

Along the way: Zaphod is cast
into the Total Perspective Vor-
tex, a fiendish device that simu-
lates the vastness of the entire
universe and then shows your

place in it by means of a small

of it. Fallaci presents this story
in-such a practical and poignant
manner that, regardless of your
views on the subject, the reader
is never compelled to form any
type of judgmental opinion.

The main character in this
novel is, of course, a young.
unmarried and pregnant
woman. She is an intelligent
person and has a blossoming
career. From the time her preg-
nancy is confirmed, she is
besieged with advice from her
friends and family to have an
abortion. The beauty of this
story is the result and the agony
of her decision to keep the
child.

Almost from the moment of
conception, she begins a
journal-like series of letters to
her unborn child. She shares
her feeling of fear, explaining
how she is plagued by the chan-
ces of jeopardizing her business
future and all the obstacles she

If you haven't read the Hitch-
hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you may
not fully appreciate much of the
sheer craziness that fills this
book. However, if you like
science fiction and are not
opposed to parody of that genre,
you'll undoubtedly find both of

way to spend a few hours.

warm, witty and everything
else they're expected to be. The
stories themselves are well
crafted, just like love itself.
And, just as in love, the ending
of the stories always matches
up with the middle and the
beginning, no matter how
much we may wish and pray for
them not to match up at all.- In
all, Colwin presents a some-
times glossy but satisfying
view of Life in love. '

Love in these tales occurs in
all stages of life with all types of
people; from "A Girl Skating,”
where a poet's fascination with
a child as she grows up is
explored from the pointof view
of the child, who doesn't want
the adoration, to the charm-
ingly sophisticated "Delia's
Father," a tale of a young girl's
path into womanhood via the
European father of a school-
friend, to the hilariously funny
and on target tale of a woman
who has spent her entire mar-
ried life stoned, ("The Achieve
Of, The Mastery of The
Thing)." These stories, along
with the title work, "The Lone
Pilgrim," are the best, depicting
love in its slightly cynical, dis-
tanced tone that epitomizes the
'80s way we form relationships.

The worst of these _ tales,
"Travel," is a confusing blend of
past, present and future with
overtones of precognition that
the reader couldn't possibly be
expected to understand. The
c_haracters lack all taste and
warmth. Their life isn't really a
result of their own doing
because we can't ever figure out
what their own doing is.‘

But the rest illustrate love as
it truly is— down to the nuan-
ces and habits of those we care
about, that which so often
makes us fall in love with them,
and just as often, drives us away
from them. Laurie Colwin, for
the most part, has caught the
subtleties that make works as
short as these truly bits of cul-
ture pressed upon paper.

i’Lenny Bruce’ At The 

Checkin For A Pulse

 

 

By CHRIOER APLEGAT

”I’m not a comedian—~l’m just
Lenny Bruce.” It was a remark that
Bruce often repeated. In an era when
mainstream stand-up comedy dealt
with such socially relevant issues as
‘mothers-in-law and bad service in
‘restaurants, Bruce talked about
racial bigotry,_ censorship, sexual
hypocrisy and political absurdity. In
the process, he was very funny. Orig-
inally appealing only to musicians
and hipsters, in the early '60s, he
tapped into an audience of dissatis-
fied students and intellectuals. But
the mainstream culture and the
media only I-abeled him ”sick.” A pro-
uct of the bop era of the early '50s,
Bruce's routines were improvisa-
tionally free wheeIing—-a sort of ver-
al equivalent to a Charlie Parker
saxophone solo.
Since most present day students
robably have not even heard of
enny Bruce and think only of Pon-
ie and Howdy Doody when the '50s
are mentioned, a trip to the Pitts-
urgh LaboratoryTheatre on North
raig Street will be an eye—opening
xperience for them. Artistic direc-

or Bill Royston offers a guided tour .

o the dark side of the ’50s—-a world
a smoky Village jazz clubs and Bal-

imore strip joints, peopled by cultu-
» al dropouts, junkies, narcs and
trung-out horn players. It is the

orld of Lenny Bruce, as created by

ulian Barry in his biographical play
enny.
Do_n’t expect a biography in the
raditional sense. This’ isn't Ellison the
an or The /_‘ii[e.rm1der Graham Bell Story.
I: arry’s script ranges from the realis-
I ic’ to the theatrically absurd and
akes all stops in between. Much of

he material’ consists of dramatic‘

ealizations of Bruce's monologues;
hile in some cases the mono-
ogues suffer by this choice, often

 

~ - « . . . . ; » ¢ : r ¢ m v u .

iuuuvvuaau, ruuay KJLLUUCI 6, 12-152

it's wonderfully effective-and wildly
funny, as in the classic ”Christ and
Moses” and "Lone Ranger” routines.

Jeff Paul frequently captures the
essential Lenny Bruce. Director
Royston wisely chose not to have
Paul copy the Bruce monologues
from the records, but rather, to find
his -own style of delivery. For the

most part, this works very well.’

Paul's concentration is a bit incon-
sistent, however. Key words are
occasionally garbled, and he some-
times rushes through material that
demands a slower pace. In his
defense, it must be mentioned that
Bruce frequently made the same mis-
takes as he performed, fueled by
mainlined Dilaudid and meth. More
annoying is Paul's most un-Bruce-
like inability to improvise. When he
flubs a line (which happens more
often than it should), he stopsand

returns, robot-like, to his starting

point and offers the correct reading.

As Lenny’s wife, Rusty (Honey
Bruce refused to let Barry use her
real name), Caryl Opshinsky offers a
typical Opshinsky performance--
wonderful. With her ‘long hair dyed
red for the role, Opshinsky brings
more guts and pathos to Rusty than
Barry gave her in the script. Her tele-
phone scene, in which Rusty calls her
estranged husband to ask about their

daughter and to get some money to _

help her beat adrug rap in Hawaii, is
eloquently stunning.

Good, solid support for Paul and
Opshinsky is furnished by Douglas
Pona, Jerry Morris, Kate Royston
(whom I did not recognize until well
into the second act), -David Irwin, Joe

Schad and Ruth Ann Rooney (whose .

convulsed nun is ‘at showstopper).
Jocelyn Johnson seemstoo young to
make her role of Sally, Bruce's
mother, work. “ '

Bruce would say, they are an'unmiti-

larly good; his tenor is gutsy, and‘

his alto is gliding and lyrical. instead
of using recorded jazz for the pre-
show and intermission, I wish Roys-
ton had let these three fine jazzmen
play. Pona is, of course, an actor as
well as a musician, but Wenzel and

_ Rooney also do very well with their

roles in the play.

Paul's occasional lapses are _a
minor annoyance, but Patricia Gra-
ce's choreography is a major one. Her

direction of Opshinsky's strip

numbers ' is pristine and totally
unerotic, and quite out of keeping

withthe rest of the production. The ‘

Either Grace has never seen a profes-.

Too Fast to be Real

‘By GEORGE HOLZER

Fast Times at Ridgemont High is
supposed to be an adolescent’s
View of other adolescents.
Cameron Crowe, best known
for his Rolling Stone interviews,
went to high school for a year as
an ”undercover" student; from
this research came a book, and
from the book came this movie.

The stars of the movie are
Sean Penn as Jeff Spicoli, a
surfer-doper who goes to school
because it's there and he has to '
(he doesn't hate school; he
doesn't think about it enough to
hate it) and Jennifer Jason Leigh
as Stacy Hamilton, a 15-year-
old who goes from a virgin to a
nympho needing an abortion in
eight months. Leigh's most
promising asset is her, uh, body.
Judge Reinhold plays Brad
Hamilton, a young man who
spends his time working for
various fast-food joints and fan-
tasizing about Linda Barrett
(Phoebe Cates). The fantasizing
never gets farther than his right
hand, though. Mike Damone
(Robert Romanus) and Mark
”Rat" Ratner (Brian Backer) are

two friends who want the same
girl, Stacy, and face losing each
other over her.

The story progresses through
sex, drugs, dreams, romance
and school—all the things that
play a part in growing up. The
problem is that nobody lives like
these people do; if’ they did we
would be worse off than we are
now. The over-dramatization
makes the movie go from prom-
ising to mundane very quickly.
And then it gets really bad.

Although the movie is bad, 

the soundtrack is great, featur-
ing such class acts as the Go-
Go’s, Billy Squier, Sammy
Hagar, and Jackson Browne. All
of the cuts for the album are
originals, but the movie has
”We’ve Got The Beat” (Go-
Go’s), ”American Girl" (Tom
Petty), and "Moving In Stereo”
(The Cars).

If you liked P0rlcy'5 (and can

Say so in public), you will proba—

Here's an interview with David
Iohansen. For those who think that
David was a member of the
Animals-—weIl, maybe it's time to
leave. But, for those who can drag
out their old N. Y. Dolls albums and
circle the picture of D.].’s face, read
on. This o_ne’s really bohemian.

SHOWCASE: How's the tour going?
Is it an extensive one?

IOHANSEN: Man, I've been touring all
my life. Ever since my first solo album came
out, I've been on the roa,d—it's the only way I
know how to make a living (laughs). Any-
way, our latest shows with the Who have been
pretty good-—we even got an ovation in
Pittsburgh.

What about the album, where did
you get the concept?

The album's doin' great. I don't know what
the figures are or anything,»but it's getting a
lot of airplay (pauses) except in Pittsburgh...
(Laughs) What about the live
concept?

The album happened when we got these two
new guitarists for the band. Right after that,
we did this video concert for MTV, and when
I saw the tapes I said, "Wow, these guys are
really great—I bet this would make ‘a great
live album." I think "Live it Up" is like
definitive me, you know, becauselgo out there
and I try to get everyone to have some fun; to
feel good about himself and his girlfriend or
whatever.

Is that why the album has a lot of
party covers on it?

Part yes and part no. When we're out on the
road we don't want to do just songs from my
old albums—it would be too boring. So
instead, I take the best of my originals and I
mix them up with some covers, you know,
because those old fifties and sixties tunes are a
helluva lot offun, and likelsaid, Itry to make
my concerts a fun time.

_ You always manage to make those

cover songs sound like you wrote
them yourself. How do you give
them such a personal flavor?

Journey

By SCOTT ‘MERVIS

A band amounts to more than the
sum of its parts. When the magic is
there in the and,each instrument
becomes a personality, this band
reaches what they mystically refer to
as ”the core." But, just as this band
defies a label, the Core defies definiti-
on. Actually, the core cannot be des-
cribed, but only felt. It is the spirit,
the flow between relationships and a
reaching toward an enlightening
awareness.

The Core presents a blend of
reggae-influenced new music that
incorporates dashes of R&B, blues,
and of course, rock ’n' roll. Their
music comes from the Jamaican Ras-
tafarian tradition, and with it a Bob
Marley-ish tone of street-wise spirit-
uality and sensuality. Singer and
songwriter Tony Miles is defi/antly
charismatic in his acrobatic leaps and
expressive spiritual poses, and his
attitude is a reflection of the band's

' positive nature. He is powerful in

pulling the audience into the music,
while the repetition of the jerking
rhythm builds to climax the seduc-
tion. The band is a celebration of the
present moment, and the joy flowing
from the stage eventually becomes
contagious enough to bring the most
unlikely dancers to their feet. Their
material is diversified by its variation
of rocking rhythms and the wide
range of subjects suggested, which

spread from the sexuality of ”The,

Did you notice that too? I always wonder to
myself, "Damn, how come I'm not gettin'
royalty checks for ‘I'll be There,' " and then I
realize, "Hey, stupid, I didn't write those."

people who never even heard ofthe New York

Then you'd rather be known as
David Iohansen instead of one of the
N.Y. Dolls?

Yeah, I guess you could say that.

NO, it ’s like this is a different identity
for me. I ’m getting more airplay now
than the Dollsever did. People are listen-
ing to my music now and that’s what
matters, you know? There will always be
a cult of Dolls fans, and at the same time
there will always be a lot more people

The band is managed by ex-
Houserocker Marc Reisman and is
composed of Tom Chockla on key-
‘boards and guitar, Ken Crisafio on
drums, Brook Duer on bass and Kurt
Resch on guitar.

Tom Chockla, who is also the other
principal lyricist, was delightfully
articulate and personal in expressing
his feelings to me about the band, the
music and the purpose. He dramati-
cally related to me a dream that he
had which he felt touched on the
essence the band and his perspective
of it. In the dream, he is standing atop
a mountain, witnessing below him
the crumbling of the earth, and sil-
houetted in front of nightmarish
images of destruction are two men.
One is speaking to another, who
appears to be terrified and even para-
lyzed by the situation. In the midst of
the fiery, reddish-orange, hellish sur-
roundings, the talkative man notices
a beautiful stream of blue light eman-
ating from a gaping hole in the earth.
When he looks down into the hole,
and the blue light flushes his face, he
glimpses the core ‘of the earth and
falls into shrieks and fits of ecstacy.
He runs around screaming and
laughing, back and forth from the
hole to the other man. He tries des-

Do you keep in touch with Syl Syl-
vain and Johnny Thunders?

I usually do. I used to always keep in touch
with Syl, but he's been in Europe. Yeah, I
convinced him to play in the band for a while
until he found a label for his solo/material.
Since then, those guys have been doing their

In this metaphor, the core becomes
the center (the spirit), the feeling and
the motivation. This is what places
the medium of music in a higher
realm. Chockla maintains that this
awareness or knowledge can be trig-
gered by the music.

What kind of attitude do you take

towards your music and the music‘
business? ~

/lmbivalent (laughs). As far as my music

goes, I've told you sixty million times that I

love to have a good time with my music. I like

the people to come and have a real ecstatic time.

As far as the music industry goes, it's pretty

sad‘ business. I know though, that if every

record company closed down or crumbled into

the sea—sounds like a Hendrix song doesn't

it? Anyway, ifthere wasno one to market my.
music I know I'd still survive because I've‘
always been out there busting my ass, and I

think the people realize that.

What about the people and per-
formers who say that you can't make
a living from touring?

That's a bunch of bullshit. I've been feeding‘
myself that way for thepast five years. Those
performers just want sympathy or something.
I couldn't survive without touring. -
What kind of music do you listen to?

I don't listen to certain artists, I just listen to
certain songs, you know? I know I'm putting
another nail in the music industry's coffin,

but I just make tapes ofall the different songs I \

like. I like someone like, say, Springsteen; he's
good, right? Sure I love his music, but I_
couldn't listen to him all day.

Are you saying that today's albums
don't have as many good songs on
them? \

No, not at all, Ijustfeel that my musical tastes
have...wisened.

You've been referred to as the Mick
Jagger of New York City. Do you
think that label applies? '
Ithink the David Eisenhower of New York
is more appropriate. I don't know. The only
Mick jagger of New York is Mick Iagger.
Besides, he acts fruity on stage. I don't act
fruity. Maybe I did when I was with the
Dolls...

Is there anything else you'd like to
say?

Yeah, I'll be back to Pittsburgh——-and this
time I'm gonna break the music market wide
open.
Anytime.

SHARPEN UP FOR DUTY
Carsickness
T.M.I.

I've been looking for this one
a long time——no doubt it was
worth the wait. Save for the
short—lived Whereabouts, Car-
sickness has no competition as
the most listenable/danceable
underground (really now) band
in Pittsburgh, and this new
album proves it.
Sharpen Up For Duty, the
group's second full-length LP
on T.M.I. has all the trappings
of hard work and originality
that Carsickness manages to
\ convert to pure fun‘ during their
live shows. Although the
album's sound quality is flawed,
it's the music itself that counts,
and that is infectiously deli-
vered via Carsickness’ patent
six-ply folding and swirling of
subtle rhythms. The album is
much more structured than
Shooting Above The Garbage, yet it
manages to retain its" sponta-
neity. A
L Lead man Ioe Soap’s vocals
sound wonderfully like Richard
Butler's (Soap doesn't say

PINKY BLUE
Altered Images
Portrait Records

At first I was a bit disap-
pointed with Pinlcy Blue, Altered
Images’ second album. Then I
realized what attracted me in
the first place. She's still there.

Steve Severin, producer of
Siouxsie Sioux, created his "per-
fect” accompaniment to Clare
Grogran's unique vocals as evi-
denced by "Idols," "Real Toys,”
and "Beckoning Strings” on the
Happy Birthday album. Producers
make a difference. Martin
Rushent, famed Human
League-Dare producer, puts i-n
the trendy drum machine,
smooths out the Banshee-edged
guitar and pops up the songs,
synthesizing his "perfect"
accompaniment to Clare’s voice
on Pinlcy Blue.

You're probably wondering

 

CARSICKNESS
drifting saxophone work has a
truly hypnotic quality.

In addition to the band's regu-
lar members, Katje Flynn and
Cindy Fairweather are on hand
to give some beautiful backing
vocals on "Never Walk Alone”
that prove to be an interesting
contrast to Soap’s nicotine rasp.
The end product sounds like

something from Oh What A
Beautiful Day. The only songs
that don't really cut it are
"Hearts In Traction" and
"Chant" which are a little too
artsy for their own good. Oth-
erwise, Sharpen Up For Duty con-
tains a lot of excellent songs
with "Runaway Soldiers,"
"Flowers Of Fire," "Heard You

5

Screaming," and the title track
being the standouts.

With all of the garage bands
that come and go in this city, it's
hard to find an exception to the
rule of mediocrity. Carsickness
is that exception, and Sharpen Up
For Duty is their calling card.

what is so great about Clare.
Someone haphazardly listning
to her might think shelsounds
like Shirley Temple or a stuffy-
nosed girl. Unfortunate are
those who don't listen carefully.
Clare demonstrates confidence;
her superficial innocence
quickly matures as her uniquely
romantic enunciations are deli-
vered with an air of experience.
Don't misinterpret this as musi-
cal experience, which she and
the band are rapidly gaining, but
as the type that proves Clare is
not the little girl many label her.

Both albums display Clare’s
talents and compliment the
band's ability to back her, but
Pinky Blue's Rushent overtones
should broaden their spectrum
of potential audience. Pinlcy Blue
is not overflowing with terrific
songs, but several excellent
tracks maintain one's interest.

BUCKS FIZZ
Bucks Fizz
RCA

What, you ask, is a Bucks
Fizz? It's just what it sounds
like, a cocktail—a concoction of
champagne and orange juice
that we Americans call a
Mimosa. Bucks Fizz is also an
English foursome and their
debut American album is a con-
coction of newest wave synthe-
pop, ambrosial harmonies, and
quivering funkiness that has no
American equivalent.

.The, yawn, cover design of
Bucks Fizz is classic Speigel
Catalogue——fall issue, but it's
content that counts. '1 promise
that seconds into side one and
you will have forgotten back-to-
school fashions.

Songs like "My Camera
Never Lies" (a top five hit over-
seas), "Easy Love,” and”Land of
Make Believe" all bounce and
pulse in technically lush arran-
gements yet all remain distin-
guishable thanks to some
exciting and quirky rhythm
shifts. Bucks Fizz has taken the
sugar coated melodies of Abba
and added plenty of spice.

"One Way Love" for instance
contains good ol’ rock ’n’ roll
guitar licks and "Land of Make
Believe" flows with a Spector-
like production, all four vocalist
promenading in and out of gui-
tars, synthesizers, bells, horns,
etc. -

This is dance music as inter-
esting as Chas ]ankel's futuris-
tic Questionnaire, more complex
than either The Human League
or Soft Cell and a lot more fun
than any of them. A die-hard
traditionalist, I would still
prefer Duane Eddy or Gene

‘Vincent, but if it's modern

modes that_ get you moving,
then Bucks Fizz is sure to break
in a new pair of 'futuristic
footwear.

The first Wall of Voodoo

many cohabitors of the new

Weekend,” and "Factory," show
a lot of promise until it becomes
evident that the rest of side one
and the whole of side two snore
with the same style and
instrumentation. Stanard Ridg-
way's squeaking, pre-pubescent
voice is different but eventually
becomes too excruciating to
enjoy. The rest of the band is
"also just a little excessive in the
uneventful department.

The only song that could
actually be considered very
good is ”Factory," which con-
tains some wittily wry lyrics and
a very catchy thrashbeat. How-
ever, Ridgway's vocals just
don't seem to do the justice
necessary. ..

There's not much more to say
about Voodoo. Casualties ‘are
supposed to be buried.

GET CLOSER
Linda Ronstadt

Elektra
Although’ the critics all

seemed to hate Linda Ronstadt’s
last album, Mad Love, I liked it.
Sure, a lot of it wasn't any good,
but she did have some great
moments which almost made
the album worth it. You had to
give her credit for trying some-
thing new, even though the
combination of her voice and
the harder background didn't
always work. It was a nice

‘change from the dreary pop

style she had been stagnating in
for the past few years.

Well, the critics should be
happy. The new album, Get
Closer, for the most part, is a
return to that style. And a dis-
appointing one at that. Like
Mad Love though, it does have its

 

yioments. These moments
sound like a cross between the
sound of Mad Love and her first
big-selling album, Heart Like a
Wheel. They prove, once again,

rockers and the soft ballads.
Unfortunately, everything else
is boring.

Ronstadt does a nice job on
the title track and "Tell Him"——
both sounding like lost tracks
from her last album, but the
songs themselves leave a little
to be desired. On the ballads, we
can hear the results of her train-
ing for Pirates of Penzance; "The
Moon's a Harsh Mistress,"
”Talk to Me of Mendocino” and
"My Blue Tears” (a Dolly Par-
ton/Emmylon Harris/Ronstadt
trio) are all hauntingly beauti-
ful. The rest of the album is just
rehashed crap from previous
works. Especially bad are "I
Think It's Gonna Work Out
Fine,” a duet with James Taylor
showing .tht neither has that
much soul, ”Sometimes You
Just Can't Win" and ”Mr.
Radio," a really pretty song with
lyrics that make no sense
whatsoever.

Ronstadt’s voice has never
sounded better‘. It's all the more
the pity because the songs are so
bad

JIM HOHMAN

I WANT CANDY
Bow Wow Wow
RCA
This is getting ridiculous.
Another BWW release? Their

debut album, See ]ungle!See]ungle! '

-Go ]oin Your Gang...oh, forget it.

It's too long to repeat, but, to get
back to the point, their debut
album was released less than a
year ago, then came various 12
inch singles, their Last ofthe Mohi-~
cans EP, this album and; can you
believe it, Capitol just
unearthed a 12 track BWW
album, culled from their earlier
days! And, believe me, this band
is good, but it definitely isn't
that prolific.

I Want Candy contains only
two previously unavailable
tracks, "Baby, Oh No," and a
boring instrumental "El Boss
Dicho," which, in my book,
doesn't make it a worthwhile
purchase. "Baby, Oh No" is
catchy and might finally make
BWW a Top 10 fave, but their
earlier sound——primitive mate-
rial like ”Gold, He Said," "Elimi-
nation Dancing " or ”C—30,
C-60, C-90, Go!"—-is all but
gone. ”I Want Candy," and
”Baby, Oh No" boast synthes-
ized backings and a commercial
scent that screams for Top 40

airplay. I'll always like this band,
probably because they caught
me when they were just start-
ing out, but this album is
nothing but a rip-off. J

GANG OF FOUR

[CMU, SKIBO Ballroom

September 29, 1982

By ROBERT DASH

The act of performing to the Gang
of Four is the confirmation of their
pyro-technical recordings. They have

progressed from the slashing Enter-
tainment of 1979 to the more dance-
able, funky Songs of the Free of this year,

complete with female vocals, more -

thickness, etc., etc. But without the
(proper, cumbersome equipment, the
sound achieved on Songs of the Free is
_impossible to attain. Last week at
CMU’s Skibo ballroom, The Gang of
Four were left only with their most
primal arsenal.

From the opening slap of percus-
sion, the performance was a sexual
act. First of all, there was the stare-
down, the band feeling the audience
with their eyes, even during the first

  
  
 

few driving songs. Some danced
immediately. They played with inten-
sity equal to or far surpassing that
achieved on Entertainment or either of
their two later LPs.

the angry, spitting riffs of "To Hell
With Poverty,” ”Man in a Uniform,”
”Damaged Goods " and a mixed selec-
tion of songs from all three LPs.
Never predictable.

Lead singer Jon King, in a primal,
continuous dance, complete with
changing facial twists resembling
masks enough to portray the full
force and range of the angry, inspira-
tional lyrics he was singing, became
the visual centerpiece. Midway
through, his polyester suit jacket was
soaked, and he was all over the stage,

behind Gill at stage right, in front of .

Gill, behind bassist Sara Lee at stage
left, in front of her, stumbling, arms
flailing. The fury, controlled yet
infectious, of Gill's flight from the
steady platform provided by headset-
ted drummer Hugo Burnham and
bassist Sara became a force capable of
driving the entire audience into
movement.

By the final songs, the two encores,
there was slamming beneath the

GANG’ OF FOUR

monitors and the Gang were smiling,
moving in and out of each other, their
rising ‘energy an ecstasy extended
into the sweating, dancing people.
The band had to work hard to win-
to progress from the initial stare-
down where some bands with the
reputation of the Gang of Four could
have stuck. Perhaps the most impres-
sive facet of the show was their refu-
sal to’ lapse into dour faces and
mechanical reproductions of their
songs and to be satisfied until they
themselves were having fun, dancing
and gaining rapport with the people.

Projecting the common man and
Marxist emphasis on _most of their
socially angry and/or satirical songs,
singer King refused to be given typi-
cal rock 'n’ roll homage at the show’s

~ end. ”Sieg Heil!" he said to the crowd,

many whose arms were extended
above their heads with open palms
facing the stage, as if to say, ”Yes, we
have worked hard to be exciting mus-
ical performers, but our place is no
higher than yours.” The Gang of
Four believe in their songs for the
free, and perhaps as important, they
had their audience believing too.

great anthem, powerful\ through
sheer simplicity and guts, and ”Ain't
Even Done With The Night” an even
better follow-up (besides being one of
the funniest videos in existence), but
for some unknown reason, material
from those days never got Cougar
very far financially, nor did it make
his name a household word. But then,

‘American Fool is released, AM junkies

go wild over this ”new sensation”
named John Cougar (remember
when he was just ]ohnny.7), and
"Hurts So Good" becomes everyone’s
favorite lip-sync. Now there are big
stories in all the important rock rags,
lots of pix of Cougar looking tough
and Harley Davidson T—shirts are all
the rage. Forget the obscure gruff-
voiced guy with the shaggy hair and
the earring. Now he's a number one
selling Rock Star—public property.
Ah, that familar feeling of betrayal....
Okay, so I'm not being exactly fair;
it's not his fault that he's so popular,
but it's frustrating for an old fan to
see him up there on the big Arena
stage mugging for the drooling
masses. It seems hisenew status has
made him overly confident, and, let's
not mince words, more than a bit
-obnoxious. Maybe David Lee Roth
can get away with grabbing his
crotch, because he's, well, David Lee
Roth and you expect it from him, but.
Cougar looked downright embar-
rassing doing the same. Maybe he
wants a shot in Playgirl; who knows,
now that everyone loves him so much
maybe he'll get the center spread.
And did I mention the go-go dance?
Yeecchhh! Leave the cheap theatrics to
somebody else, too.
As for the band and the music: the
band was merely adequate, akin to.

and the music predictable. ”Thirty
Days In the Hole," an odd choice,
opened the show, followed by ”Ain’t
Even Done With the Night,” ”Hurts
So Good,” ”]ack And Diane” (my pick
for Worst Song of The Year, and the
hands down winner for Worst Line in
”.....tWo American kids growing up
the heartland...”), etc., etc. The
encore was a terrible version of the
Stones’ masterpiece ”You Can't
Always Get What You Want,"
appropriate only for its words, per-
haps. Maybe my view of Cougar and
his performance would be different if
he'd put on a really superb show, but I
saw nothing that night which fur-

ithered the cause of rock and roll.

Playing all the hits and running
around do not an artist make. Write a
littl ditty 'bout that one, John.

- Though there were just as many
people at. the Arena to see Cougar,
Heart was the headliner, and after
the opener, it was easy to see why.
Anne Wilson probably possesses the
best female voice in rock and roll, and
she let everybody know it, from the
opening of ”Even It Up” right
through to the three—count’em,
three—encores_, which included Zep-
pelin’s» ”Been A Long Time (Since I
Rock and Rolled)" and the Troggs’
”Born to Be Wild.” In between, there
was "Crazy On You," "Straight On,"
”Bebe Le Strange,” "Magic Man,”
”Dog and Butterfly ” and more obs-
cure pieces like "Sweet Darling,"
where Anne showed off her key-
board skills and ”Silver Wheels,” an
instrumental showcasing Nancy Wil-
son's impressive talents as a guitarist.

The stage show itself was pretty
spectacular, with backdrops (during
”Minstel Wind"), a multi-colored
tiered stage, which glowed various
shades of the rainbow and dry ice fog
that, for once, didn't look cheap.

The sisters Wilson know what
they're doing; their "novelty" as a girl
act is way behind them. Now they're
simply one of the best acts in the rock
world.

Volleyball Team Searching For EastTitle

By MARK A. SINDLER

“Without question we are No. 1
in the East.”

On that high note, coach
Shelton Collier’s volleyball team
will attempt to strike up its fifth
straight Eastern championship.

The Pitt Invitational Classic
will play host to Penn State,
Louisville and Syracuse. The
weekend tournament’s first serve
will commence at 7 tonight when
the Cardinals square off against
I’itt;

Collier’s squad has reached an
interesting point in its season in
that it is experiencing many good
fortunes.

“We began the season and knew
we had a questionable structure,”
Collier continued.

“But the team has made the
commitment to play harder and
better, so everyone is now gunning
for us as a result of our ranking.
Before, we were not expected to win
big, but now we have gone from
being the underdog to being the
favorite.” I

Indeed, when Pitt faced the
Nittany Lions two weeks ago, the
latter were ranked 13th or 14th and

 

 

were considered the best in the
East. However, now they are taking
a backseat to the Lady Panthers
who are tabbed at 17th and Penn
State is not even in the Top 20.

In fact, the 3-6 Nittany Lions are
in a state of turmoil presently
Coach Russell Rose is in the
process of a lot of reorganizing.

He continued, “I am just trying
to regroup my team. One player
has quit and four girls are
recovering from illnesses received
while we were in Houston last
week.”

For Rose, it has been a “roller
coaster year” so far. He indicated
that his team plays well against
some fine teams and occasionally
plays~poorly against some poor
teams. .

The sophomore starter that
resigned from the Nittany Lions
was a veryimportant part in the
squad’s smooth operation.

“Her loss means we have to
replace a very important player,”
Rose said. “I have to get a lineup
that is very competitive and am
more concerned with playing well
in November than in October.”

It can therefore be theorized that
Penn State is not in town looking
to avenge its big defeat earlier to

   

Pitt. Currently, Rose just wants to
play as efficiently as possible and
head into the stretch drive next
month in the best shape possible.

Ironically, Collier’s troops are
entering the classic with a touch of
over-confidence.

“Before, we had nothing to
lose,” Collier said. “Now that we
are ranked and are without Ulana
(Kohutiak), though, we may be
pressing a bit too much.

“We must play loose and
confident this weekend and adopt a
different kind of feeling.”

Collier also pointed out two key
factors for a prosperous volleyball
weekend. “If Carmen (Tapia) can
successfully , neutralize Lori
Barbarich, we will be in good
shape. She is their (Penn State’s)
No. l spiker and I expect Carmen
to have a good match against her.

“Another important aspect is
Pat's (Belcher) success. She is
inexperienced but is capable of
playing a super match. Her game is
improving steadily and she only
lacks the game time. Because of her
physical attributes that is all that
lacks.”

What Louisville was lacking up
until three years ago was a viable
volleyball program. Coach Scott

   

Diane Zack (8) is‘ guldlng the_ Lady Panther volleyball team to an Eastern

championship.

Boaters Fall To Akron, 5-0

By JIM COLLINS‘

The Pitt soccer team continues
its search for the right combination
to bring a scoring punch to the
lackluster Panther offense. The
team suffered a shutout Tuesday
afternoon at the hands of Akron
5-0.

Akron entered the game coming
off a loss from Penn State, which
knocked them out of the Top 20.
Meanwhile, Pitt was rebounding
off of a 2-1 loss to Mercyhurst.

In the opening minutes of the
game, Akron demonstrated why
they should be ranked among the
Top 20, taking advantage of their
scoring opportunities against Pitt.
The Panther defense had no trou-
ble adjusting to Akron's style of
play, scoring two goals in the first

25 minutes of play. For the rest of
the half, Pitt played evenly with
Akron, giving up only one goal
and trailing at the half 3-0.

In the second half, the Panthers
played some of their best soccer all
year, according to coach Leo
Bemis. Pitt stayed with Akron, but,
as has been the case all season, the
Panthers narrowly missed their
opportunities. On the other hand,
Akron took advantage of the few
opportunities they had. And
although the shot differential was
15-9 in favor of Akron, the final
score was 5-0. I

Despite the lopsided margin.
Bemis was pleased with the team's
performance.

“Sure, we haven't scored as
much as we should, but the team's
play has improved," he said. “We
played a superior teamyet we never
gave up.” .

Bemis‘ was especially pleased
with freshman goalie Dave

Torrence.

“All of Akron’s goals were
worthy and were not Torrence‘s
fault," Bemis said. “He saved a few
potential goals."

Bemis doesn't foresee major
changes in the lineup, but he
would like to give his young play-
ers some playing time.

“We're not going to change the
lineup, but we will try to build
experience as best as we can," he
said.

— Pitt will face another stiff oppo-
nent tomorrow as the Panthers go
on the road to face Bucknell. Buck-
nell has a 6-2 record in l982 and
edged the Panthers last year l-0.

If the Panthers are able to
develop an offense from the pool of
newcomers, a win may be a
possibility.

Luster, though, heads up a squad
with 18-3 credentials even though
two key players are out due to
injuries.

Currently, he is encouraged by
his team's progress which included
strong competition against
Kentucky, Minnesota (only two
losses so far) and All-Metro
Champion Cincinnati.

Luster described his
many strong points.

“We have a primarily quick
defense,” he said. “It may sound
corny, but we also have team unity.
It is a close group and the spirit is
excellent.

‘-‘However," he continued, “our
outside blockers are not quite as
powerful as I would like them to
be. There are several players
hurting and their subs still have a
little way to go. Their youth has
shown through at times."

The Louisville team is in its
third year and relatively new. This
is due to the school’s geographical
location and also not having the
money schools like Ohio State and
Purdue are accustomed to, Luster
admitted.

Syracuse enters the tournament
at 11-6 and is coming off a let-down
weekend at Massachusetts. “We

squad’s

have been a little bit up and down

lately,” Syracuse coach Mark
Massey said. "Right now, the team
is in middle ground.”

“We have mostly sophomores
and juniors that have room to
grow, but if they make mistakes, we
also have the room to look to
experience to explain that,”
Massey added.

He is looking forward to playing
the classic’s type of competition
and just wants a strong
performance put forward.
Co-captains Carol Miller and Jean
McMahon will be looked upon in
pressure situations. The former is a
versatile outside hitter ’ and
McMahon made the all-state team
as a freshman.

Both Luster and Collier see the
upcoming matches in entirely
different lights.

Said Luster, “It is about our
mid-season and the weekend will
give us an idea of where we need to
be. This is one of our key matches.”

Collier views the Pitt-Penn State
matchup as one of many

I nationwide spotlights. “Whoever

wins is No. l in the East. It is,” he
emphasized, “a very important
contest on the national scene.”

Diane Zack:  

Unsung HeroFor

Lady Spikers

By MELODY BISH

Every team has its unsung hero.
The Steeler dynasty had Rocky
Bleier, last year’s Pitt football team
had Wayne DiBartola. This year’s
edition of the Lady Panther volley-
ball team has also been blessed
with an unsung hero in the person
of Diane Zack.

In fact,'Zack was the recipient of
last year’s Coach's Award which is
given to the team's unsung hero.

A dedicated athlete, Zack some-
times puts too much pressure on
herself. This can have a positive
effect on the team as a whole,
because when Zack gets fired up
and emotional the team also tends
to get fired up.

As Zack said, “I’m one of the

good passers of the team and if I'm i

not doing well I can have ‘a bad
influence on the team. When I
make a mistake, I can't think about
it.” '

She explained that when she gets
down on herself the others on the
team can see it and make a special
effort to pick her up, and Zack said
this effort wasn’t there last year.

Another factor which has had a
salutory effect on Zack’s play is the
fact that last summer she served as
Collier’s assistant coach on a jun-
ior volleyball team called the Three
Rivers Volleyball Club. This team

took third place at the AAU
National junior Olympic
Tournament.

Collier said he feels this expe-
rience, has helped—Zack be able to
see the game from both a player's
and a coach's perspective. Zack also

c

feels that the coaching experience
was helpful, as she says that per-
haps one day she would like to go
into coaching as a career.

‘‘I’ve learned a lot from Coach
Collier," Zack said. “He has a spe-

cial way of communicating, espe- -

cially to younger girls, but now
that's coming across here too.”

Collier sees Zack’s maturity as
having a great effect on the team.
He also said she is one of the most
skilled players on the team and the
“backbone of the team's success.”

Zack said she feels that this year’s
squad has a special unity. She
believes that the team will defi-
nitely reach the NCAAs, but
doesn't know how far they are ca-
pable of going.

"When we get into the NCAAs,
we’ll surprise a lot of people," she
said. “People are going to take us
for granted, but as long as we main-
tain our mental toughness we can
go far." ' '

Zack believes that a berth in" the
final 16 is not an unreasonable pos-
sibility and anything beyond that
will be just pure desire.

Zack also said she's glad she
came to Pitt. Before enrolling, she
gained valuable experience by
playing on the United States Air
Force volleyball team. In 1976, she
was named to the Armed Services
All-Star team.

Many times the player who gets
all the praise and adulation is the
name player. Though she is not
such a player, no one deserves more
publicity than Diane Zack. And
she’s one of the reasons the Lady
Panther volleyball team has
achieved a national ranking for the
first time in the history of the sport.
