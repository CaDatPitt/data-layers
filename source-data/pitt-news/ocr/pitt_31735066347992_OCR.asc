Students claiming academic injury
due to teacher irresponsibility can

_appeal directly to the head of the

department involved, according to
a policy statement issued by the
Student Affairs Committee and the
Tenure and Academic‘ Freedom
Committee, pending Senate Coun-
cil approval. , -

The statement presented at
Monday's University Senate Coun-

 cil meeting proposed guidelines of
 ‘‘

professional ethics and academic
integrity for both faculty and
students. 4

Calling for “impartial evaluation
on the part of the faculty. and
honest academic conduct on the
part of the students.” the
statement reflects more than a year
of deliberation by administrators,
Senate Committees. and-student
leaders. .

The stafement stresses the
responsibility of faculty members
to meet their. classes when

"scheduled and base all academic

evaluations upon good-faith pro-
fessional judgement, »
Substantial and varied objections
to the statement have arisen among
Council members, and almost all
voice dissatisfaction with what they
called indefinite phraseology.
“This report shows that faculty
members as well as students have a
code to follow," said Council
member Robert Mundell. “but the
vague language makes the guide-
lines it proposes unenforceable and
inappropriate when drafted into
statutes. A 4

and noted “a flexibility or tailoring
of these articles could be affected."

Council member Cyril Fox ex"-
pressed concern‘ over apparent-
inequities in the statement saying,
“Students can appeal directly to
department deans when they feel
they are being wronged, while
faculty members cannot. Why are
they treated differently?”

Brown replied that, under the
guidelines, faculty members can
appeal their case to the Committee
on Tenure and Academic Freedom.
The Committee would in turn
recommend action to the Judicial

High Dorm Fees Credited
To State Aid Regulations

BY BOB EVANS

Pitt's standing as one of the most
expensive state-related‘ schools for
resident students in the nation is
chiefly dependent on the. funding
policies of the Pennsylvania state
government.

Donovan Hughes, Associate Dir-
ector of University Housing for
Business Affairs, explained that in
Pennsylvania, the legislature does
not allocate money to its schools for
such things as the University Food
Service, the dormitories,
Student Union Recreation Center,

‘ the campus bookstore, or any other
such strictly non-academic func-

the .

   
  

iliaries. are financed solely through
the room and board fees, and
receive no financial subsidization
from the state. ’ ' ’
"In comparison to similar institu-
tions in other states. which are
under state funding. the funds
coming into the University of
Pittsburgh from the state are not
being channeled into auxiliary
operations." Hughes said.
Although Pitt’s board fees were
lower than average national fig-"
ures, their room fees were
considerably higher than’ the
average. With the national median
being $469 ‘per year, Pitt’s room

 

Assistant for Academic Affairs,
said deans could eliminate grades
but they could not add to them.
“Deans may recommend re-testing
of an individual, or let a low grade
stand, but they could never assign
‘a higher grade than one given by a
professor,” he noted.

CAS Assistant Deans Name

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

CASDean Robert Marshall, who
upon his appointment 1 1/2 years
ago promised to combat a
deadening interest in various
academic programs. has appointed
three new assistants to join him in
the fight.

Jack Daniel, past chairman of
Pitt's black studies department,
has been named associate dean;
Marcia Landy. former president of
the University Senate. and Virginia
Elliot, former director of the
composition program. have been
appointed assistant cleans.

In a break with tradition. the three
assistants will work on special
projects coordinated by Marshall,
instead ofeach having a wide range
of duties and responsibilities.

"We are giving them one thing to
do and that alone," Marshall said
of his new aides. ‘_'l think we will
be much better off with these
people focusing on specific issues.
ilihc important thing is focus.

“There is one major difference in
these appointments compared to
others we’ve made,” Marshall‘

Judicial Board Charges
Pending in Drug Cases  

By RlTA VITOLO

Charges will be filed with the
University‘s Campus Judicial
Board on at leastsix Cf the stu-
dents arrested by Allegheny Coun-
ty Police in Saturday night’s nar-
cotics incident in the McCormick
Hall residence. according to as-
sistant Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Marcus.

Marcus added it is --likely
charges will be levied against 12
others implicated in the incident.

“We consider this to be a seri-
ous matter, a matter of the grav- ‘
est gravity. The possession, sale

. and distribution of ‘drugs in Uni-

versity dormitories is a violation
of University housing regulations
of the greatest severity,” Marcus
said.

He declined to speculate on the
possible extent of the J—Board
sanctions in the case.

Students faced with Judicial
Board charges have the option of

a hearing before a five-student A

member panel. or a special hear-
ing officer. Counsel for J-Board
hearings can originate either in

crucial areas. Then we chose
various people who were qualified
to look into the specific areas. So in
this case, we determined the needs
of the College before we chose the
assistants.” 

Marshall explained all three
assistants have expertise in the
areas they .have been chosen to
examine. «

For example, Marshall said, Elliot
helped to abolish the freshmen
English composition requirement
and establish a more comprehen
sive curriculum in which more
composition courses are taught at
different. levels. As an assistant‘
dean. she will be “advertising" the
program, by trying to get faculty in
all departments to share the
responsibility of encouraging stu-
dents to participate in
composition program.

Daniel, the new associate dean _

who was an administrative intern at
-Stanford last year, is slated to
examine V and evaluate various
academic programs in the College.
,In addition, he has been asked to ‘
study and report on the actual

, administration of CAS.

Director of Housing and Food
grvices, Thomas Albert, explain-
‘, ‘The overall room and board
te is what should be looked at
more closely, instead of the
jparate charges.’

I?itt,"s high room rate, he said, is

price doubled.” -

Hughes noted states other than
Pennsylvania may have policies
whereby subsidization of auxiliary
operations are carried out.
Because of these policies, compari-
sons between PennsyIvania’s state
schools and\ other states’ schools
are not accurate, as it is a matter of
how much the different states wish
to dispense to the schools, rather
than of how much an individual
university charges. ‘

Also, Pitt’s entire labor force is
unionized, while other states may
not deal through unions, giving

' those states an edge in negotiations

Hughes said. ,

Despite the high room costs,
Albert said the number of students
desiring to live in the dorms has
increased. The waiting lists, which
this year numbered about 220
students, are getting longer from

waiting list, approximately 50
students are presently housed in
Webster Hall on a temporary basis.-
Although tuition rates at Pitt have
not been increased, University
Assistant Treasurer Ted Corbett
explained that like room and board
fees, tuition is dependent upon how
much money is allocated to the
University.
Corbett said, “What determines
the tuition rate is how much other
resources the University has.
Basically, the cost of education is

the same at all universities.
“However, what makes the tui-

tion rate different is how much in
gifts and grants a school receives.
If it is state-related, like Pitt, it
depends upon how much state
appropriation is received.”

“The money used in financing Pitt
comes from a variety of sources,”
Corbett explained.

“The University receives reven-
ues from a number of different
places. One place is the state,
another the ‘alumni and friends,

 City SUmmilSels Money Goals

  

BY BILL MOORE
Balancing the federal budget,
increasing" industrial productivity,
and allowing the national money
supply to grow at a rate equal to
inﬂation were the key answers to

curbing inﬂation formulated at a ‘

Business and Manufacturing Con-
ference on Inﬂation held Monday in
Pittsburgh. V A

The conference, termed an
“Economic Mini-Summit Confer-
ence,” was one of 12 regional

conferences called for by President ‘

Ford to probe the causes and
possible answers to inﬂation.
Recommendations stemming from

‘ ‘discussion at these conferences will

be presented inlWashington on
September 27 and 28 at a ﬁnal

Conference on Inﬂation. President_

Ford will
conference.

Pittsburgh's mini-conference,
held at .the William Penn Hotel,
was chaired by US Secretary, of
Commerce Frederick B. Dent. Also
present were Senators Abraham A.
Ribicoff (D-CT); J. Glenn Beall
(R-MD); Robert Taft, Jr. (R-OH);
Samuel A. Nunn (D-GA); and
Representatives Neal Smith (D-IA);
William S. Moorehead (D-PA);
Garry Brown (R-MI) and Barber 
Conable, Jr. ‘(R-_N_Yw).._»____

preside over that

Conferring with the congressmen‘, I

senators, and Secretary Dent were
more that 40 business and indust-
rial leaders from Pennsylvania,
New York, Ohio, and nearby states.
Major issues’ discussed and
solutions suggested were:
FEDERAL BUDGET: The major-
ity of participants agreed that it
was necessary, if inﬂation were to
be slowed, to balance the federal
budget during the 1975 fiscal year

(July '74 to June ’75). Manford 0..

Lee, Chairman of V.F. Corporation,
Reading, PA, called for “major
surgery on the federal budget to
eliminate waste and duplication
and realistically establish priorities
on the basis of what the country can
afford.” Among areas to
examined for possible “waste and
duplication” were foreign aid,
welfare, and military expenditures.

In 21 out of the last 30 years the L

US government has operated in the
red resulting in a massive national
debt. This debt was named by most
as a major inﬂuence on the
economy. I.

PRODUCTIVITY: The business-
men called for increased research
anddevelopment aimed at increas-
ing industrial productivity. Senator

be‘

Nunn of Georgia, in a preliminary
statement to the conference,
said:“A healthy rate of productivi-
ty growth means that the economy I
can support a steadily rising rate of
wages without necessarily forcing a
major increase in prices. The
absence of productivity growth
during the past year has intensified
inﬂationary pressures throughout
the economy.”

E. Mandel] deWindt, Chairman of
Eaton Corporation, Cleveland, was
one of many business ofﬁcials who
blamed “social and ecological
programs’,’ with consuming money
which normally would have’ gone
into research to increase produc-
tivity.' ‘ _

MONEY SUPPLY: An increase of

‘money supply for credit purposes

was called for byimany. J .' Willard
Marriot, Chairman of-the Marriot
Corporation, Washington, DC sug-
gested “variable tax credit to‘ meet"
needs of business and industry”
and “accelerated depreciationff
The general view of business and
industry at the conference was
easier terms on borrowed money to
allow more business investment.
\This, according to many, would

,allow business to better predict

their annual expenses and hold
prices at a minimum.
TAXES: A reduction of taxes on

Americans cope with
although it was not suggested as a
means to alleviate it.

No concensus of opinion was

reached on taxing of business,
industry, and high-income citizens.
‘POVERTY AND UNEM_PLOY-
MENT: Concentration on these

problems blamed on inﬂation was I

agreed to at the conference. No
concrete programs wre suggested
to achieve an end to them.

OTHER SUGGESTIONS: Issues
brought up at the conference other
than the above included wage and
price controls, with the majority of
business speakers terming the
controls “inﬂationary and ineffec-
tive." A nationwide program
alerting consumers to anti-inﬂa-
tionary actions they can enact was
suggested. Also proposed was a
federal program creating jobs in
areas of improved mass transpor-

tation systems and improved living E

conditions.

The ultimate effect of the__1_2_

conferences will be, in the words of

secretary Dent,"‘to glean the best
ideas from the conferences and
present them to the ﬁnal confer-
ence, members of the Executive
branch, and ultimately the"Con-
gress.” e

Tuesday on 30-day furloughs.

-F‘ funds to‘ the Pitt Hockey Club should be rejected by the Student
Government Board at their meeting tonight and sent back to the
Allocations Committee for revision. ‘

‘«The Pitt Hockey Club was denied funds last March by Student
Govemment in an effort to pressure the Athletic Department into
assuming the club’s operational costs. '

Government, provedunsuccessful and as a result the Pitt Hockey Club
was forced to reapply for allocations to maintain hockey operations at
_ was the understanding in March when the club was ﬁrst denied
flmds that if the Athletic Department could not be persuaded to fund
the Hockey Club, Student Government would continue to subsidize its
fperations.
Though the committee has basically lived up to its commitment, the
___reduction of the Hockey Club budget from the requested $2340 to
- $1040 will even more severely inhibit the operations of the club by
‘ forcing the individual members to bear even a greater burden of the

Allende overthrow

F ord’s Global Strategy Game   

BY TOM.SMlTH

At his press conference Monday
night President Gerald Ford was
barraged with a series of questions
on his decision to pardon former
President Richard M. Nixon for all
Watergate crimes. Yet, it was not
his incomplete answers to these
questions that sent a shudder
through the nation.

The President was asked two
questions concerning American
involvement in the overthrow of the
democratically elected government
of Salvador Allende in Chile.
Recent reports from the US
Congress have indicated the United
States had played a role in the
Chilean coup d’etat.

Americans listened the other
night totheir president ..—not only
stating that the US government had
been involved, but also that such

governmental interference would,

continue if he, the President,
determined it was in ‘the best

interests of the United States.

Such a statement is ‘frightening
for two reasons. The ‘United States
government which over the_ years
has supported the international
peace keeping efforts of the United
Nations was openly admitting that
it violated the UN Charter which it

signed in good faith more than two.

decades ago. That charter
prohibits interference by one
country in the internal affairs, of
another. '

"mine, ‘and they follow.

Secondly, and far worse, the
President of the United States
sanctioned and expressed amazing
ambivalence to the concept of
involvement by the United States in
the internal affairs of foreign lands.

It was expressly because of this
policy adopted by Fidel Castro that

the United States along with the‘

Organization of American States
imposed rigid economic sanctions
on the Cuban government.

The US has gone to war countless
times to preserve its territorial and
ideological integrity against foes
considered oppressors and enemies
of democracy.

Internal battles have been fought
in the US to repel the internal
subversion of the American consti

tutional processes,, which some

politicians claimed were occurring.

One need only recall the terror of
the McCarthy hearings in the‘50's
to understand the degree to which
Americans are repulsed by the
thought that foreign representa
tives’ interfere in the activities of

the American government.

But, now, the President of the
United States, sworn into office, as
the representative of the American
people, has confessed the govern
ment did indeed interfere with and
manipulate the constitutional pro
cesses which thrust Salvador
Allende into the leadership of his
country and which he was sworn to
uphold. "

Ford said American participation
consisted only of preserving
Allende’s opposition, including the
Chilean news media and opposing
political parties. This was done,
according to the President, to
prevent Allende from quashing
these opposition forces.

Yet, Ford further contends the US

government had nothing whatsc
ever to do with the actual
overthrow, even though the facts
indicate the Allende overthrow was
precipitated by forces opposed to
his socialist government--forces
which were being subsidized by the
American government to the tune
of $11 million. ,
‘Thus, the US government itself
has relinquished all rights to object
to the subversion of its constitution
al processes by a foreign or internal
adversary. Such subversion can be
accepted in the name of playing the
great global strategy game.

As long as v the American

government, the great moral leader "

of the world, is willing to sanction
its own participation in the
overthrow of foreign governments
or blatant involvement in their
internal processes, it will also have
little difficulty approving the
destruction of the governmental
processes instituted by the Found
ing Fathersvnearly 200 years ago.

Afterall, that too someday,
according to some president, just
might be in the best interests of the

/ American people.

 Career Seminar Views Liberal Arts Hopes



BY TOM WASELESKI

Anxiety over careers is nothing
new for ‘today’s graduate. But
particular concern is expressed, or
at least should be, by students
majoring in liberal arts. A hot
debate continues to rage over the
questionable value of a liberal arts
major to grads looking for a job in a
society that has ‘become increas-
ingly profit-oriented in recent
years.

The Career Seminar Division of
Pittfs Counseling Center, directed
by Christine Johnson, brings the

  controversy to the Career Seminar
Series in the form of a seven-mem-

ber panel that will shed shome light
on exactly what the prospects are
for liberal arts graduates and, more
important, why.

Those scheduled to speak on the
liberal arts major include: Caryl
Morse Kline, the Director of Con-
tinuing Education for Women at
Pitt, Richard E. Barber, President
of the Urban Talent Corporation;
John Staley, a regional vice-presi-
dent at Pittsburgh National Bank;
Samuel Hazo, author and Director
of the International Poetry Forum;
Margaret Gavolla, Careers Coor-

S dinator at Chatham College; James

B. Branagan, Assistant Corporate
Controller in Accounting for Alle-
gheny Ludlum Industries, lnc.;
David M. Bates, Manager of
College Relations for the United
States Steel Corporation._

Not on the liberal arts panel, but
also speaking at the seminar,‘ is
Gary Cruikshank, the owner of
Omnibus, a modification of the
old-fashioned “general store" lo-
cated on Meyran Avenue. Cruik-
shank, a graduate of Pitt’s School
of Pharmacy, said “small busi-
nessmen couldn’t help but be
bettered by liberal_arts. Small

carrying it out to the best of your
ability."

“Put yourself in the position of
the customer,” the Oakland mer-
chant advised liberal arts majors
thinking of going into business on
their own. He complained too
many owners “Lose sight of this as
they become successful,” and a-
greed that a liberal arts back-
ground gives one a well-balanced
base necessary for keeping abreast
of trends in the market.

David M. Bates, college relations
and recruiting director for United
States Steel, was even more enthu-
siastic, citing the liberal art major’s
“potential for growth, for learning,
and for advancement from a career
standpoint." He cautioned stu-
dents that there are two types of
liberal arts ‘majors: the first is the
“pure liberal arts major, whose
employment prospects are the
same as they have been, and that
is, not particularly plentiful; the
second type _is the liberal arts
student that devotes some time to
job training, and the prospects for
this student are very good."

Bates’ adviceito majors in the
liberal arts includes “getting into
category two and getting out of
category one by taking some ca-
reer-related courses.” Take sum-
mer work in a desired position
since employers often rehire the
same persons permanently upon

graduation—60% of all liberal arts

graduates ‘hired this year by US
Steel had worked previouslygwith
the company. T

Internships likewise can give a
student a foot in the job-market
door, according to Margaret Ga-
volla, Chatham's Careers Coordi-
nator._ “Employment prospects for
liberal arts majors," she said, “are
definitely there, but students must
sell themselves harder....by mak-
ing sure they have a diversity in
courses."

The iebate over the value of a
liberal arts major has philosophical
implications as well. “The first
school believes we are educated for
life; the second school argues that
we are educated for a living, which
they contend, is life," J.ames B.
Branagan styled himslef as a
moderate in this debate, though
leaning somewhat to the second
position. The time has come, he

argued, when “technical trainingj

should account for 25 to 30% of the
total credits in liberal arts.”

Although Branagan conceded that
liberal arts is “invaluable," he
stressed that the major has reached
a crisis in its existence which
demands that “the technical aspect
must be included. Prospects are

tough, really tough....and it's ’go- .

ing to get worse,” he warned,
pointing to the-job market in
private industry.

  wedaaéaay, September 1s,,j1'9r4—jTHE?iP1TT NEWS—Pa

"The job market is tough for
anybody...collegians know that,”
echoed Pittsburgh poet Samuel
Hazo. Speaking on his own
professio,_r_1,__‘_‘writing is no way to
earn a living." He did contend that
there are many people in industry
who prefer good liberal arts grad-
uates because such students have
been known to apply themselves in
a logical fashion to problems and
the search for adequate solutions.

Hazo said that employers are
beginning to find out that “you
can't ‘train’ a mind "beyond the
technical profession.” Only a
logical process of thought can find
solutions; Training may lead to the
answer, but it may not be able to
put the proper elements together to
bring it about. —

Director of Continuing Education
for Women at Pitt and member of
the Pittsburgh City Planning
Commission since 1967, Caryl
Morse Kline believes “liberal arts
is all-important in any career that
you follow" and that “it marks you
as an educated person.”

“I can't imagine being a career
person without a broad liberal arts
background," Kline continued.
The break with the classics began
“in the 1920's when someone
wanted to be an engineer and took

just engineering.” Job prospects

are “pretty much of your own

making," and many employers,

‘be taught" above the bachelor"

 
  
   
   
  
  
   
 
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
 

from merchandise outlets to hospi
tals “are delighted to have per'so'n“s,.

preciation” of the world contended?‘-
Richard E. Barber. He propose"
that liberal arts embody the bache

Barber expressed bewildermen
over the present philosophy io
American business. “Compa'nie

The Allegheny County Police have
used an undercover agent on
campus once in the last ﬁve years,

according to Paul Sebelia, admin-'

istrative assistant to the Superin-
tendent.

“That was with the knowledge of
the Campus Police,” said Seb'elia.
“To my knowledge we have never
used an undercover agent on
campus without their knowledge.”
Curt Graham, chief of the Cam-
pus «Police which shoulders the
main responsibility for crime con-
trol at Pitt, says he has no
plainclothes agents working in
University dorms. Uniformed offi-
cers do patrol the Towers and other
Pitt buildings.

uniformed or undercover, and em-
phasized the ability of the Pitt force

to handle crime at the University.

They also stressed their coopera-
tive relationship with the Campus
Police, a feeling which was echoed
by Graham:

“The Pittsburgh Police are essen-
tial to our operation,” said Gra-
ham. “We depend on them for
specialized investigations of major
crimes, and for their support
through the use of the National
Crime Information System, an in-
formation-gathering system affili-
ated with the FBI.

“The Pittsburgh Police patrol the
city-owned areas adjacent to the

security policies.

buildings and areas. But the City
Police have full police jurisdiction,

V and can patrol anywhere in the city. 3

“The University is part of the city.

It’s not a closed society,” contin-
ued Graham. “If they have a
signed warrant they don’t have to
contact us before making an arrest
or search. But they usually do, as a
matter of courtesy.”

Graham said a student’s dormi-
tory room is considered by l_aw to
be his private residence. Thus, a
police officer is required to possess
a search warrant in order to enter.

PITTSBURGH POLICE

For investigations that lead to
Pitt, the City Police usually notify
the Campus Police, according to
Superintendent Colville.

"If there was a rape, and a
student was suspected, we would
notify the Campus Police before
sending in a plainclothes officer,"
said ‘Colville. “lt"s.a matter of
common courtesy and coopera-
tion." .

Concerning drug investigations,
Colville said,“City narcotics agents
are generally not on campus, and

instead are on the streets and in

bars. On campus, we’re mainly
interested in the courtyards along
Forbes _and Fifth Avenues.

“We usually "don’t go into the
Towers without a search warrant,”
he said. “If an informed source or
the Campus Police notified us, we

ALLEGHENY COUNTY POLICE

Administrative Assistant Sebelia
said that if information from a
County Police investigation led
them to a private institution such as
Pitt, they would contact-the Cam-
pus Police before taking any action.
“We’re not authorized to take
action at Pitt unless it's a joint
move with the University Police,'”
Sebelia said. “If there was a\risk.of
a security leak though, we might go
ahead without notifying them. This

would be only in a ‘need to know’ I

situation, where security was very

A important. Undercover agents can

In defense of the students’ right to
appeal, Brown said, “When a
student is injured by an unfair
grade, he is injured in a way that
could affect his entire career.
Faculty members usually suffer
only an injury in pride when their

policy is reversed. Academic’

freedom stops short of irresponsi-
ble action.”

Chancellor Wesley Posvar called
the statement a “progressive
document” and said he hoped the
committees could clear it up in
terms oflanguage without changing
its meaning. “This shouldn’t be
looked at as a code or list of ethical
practice," he said, “but it contains
good recommendations to be

i followed by the faculty.”

The Student Council moved for a
referral of the policy statement
back to” the Student Affairs
and Tenure and Academic Free-
dom Committees for revision-

Chancellor’Posvar reported no
action was taken in the “state
government concerning the
“Greensburg proposal” which was
re-studied this summer. The
proposal, which calls for changing
the program at Pitt’s Greensburg
campus from a two-year to a
four-year upper division program,
is beingiconsidered by Pennsyl-
van1a's Council of Higher Educa-
tion. , ~

Posvar also announced Pitt’s
budg.et proposals have been
presented to the State. The
University has asked for $62
million, an increase of $10 million
over last state allocation, with $8.5
million provided for employees
compensation and benefits.

The Chancellor said the Univer-
sity’s endowments had diminished
due to the drop in the stock market,
but assured the Council invest-

.ments were being re-shifted to

compensate for this loss. He
expressed hope ‘of preventing
tuition increases next year and
added that federal grants would
probably “hold their own,” re-
maining at last year’s level.
Executive Assistant to the Chan-

_ cellor, Charles Coble reported on

progress made within the intra-
mural athletics program. “Student
Government president Mike Furick
and I have found rooms in the
Student Union for distribution and
storage of sports equipment,”
Coble said, “We also plan to
renovate showers in the Student
Union basement for participating
students." The facilities, for both
men and women, were formerly
used by food service employees.
In further action, the Committee
moved to give" StudentAffairs
Committee Chairman William Lena
ghen the right to vote at future
Senate Council meetings.

  THOUGHTS AT SMALL

4/

I Right?

BY JESS M. BRALLIER -

This past year, in the April Fool’s issue of the pitt news, I proposed
that the word, art, be changed to fart. To my surprise, instead of
embarrassment over the proposal, I find the idea increasingly
attractive.

I find the word art to be undefinable. Certainly, there’s common odds
n’ends, a sensing of sorts that enables one to «differentiate between a
Cathedral urinal and the Mona Lisa. There are accepted qualities and
tastes but nothing definite and precise, and the situation is .
understandable. After all, art’s a personal thing with touches of
environmental qualities and a bit of social-‘pressure added. But sadly,

"Ti:..because of the lack of a precise‘ definition, the word has been rendered

useiss. 1

Words such as skill and craft are no longer good enough for the
masses. It is now “The Art of Cooking,” “The Art of Walking,” “The
Art of Throwing Footballs.” Uh, uh, no way, people. Nobody, I don’t
give a damn who it is, is going to convince .,me that the Galloping
Gourmet, Beethoven, Shakespeare, James Joyce’, Col. Sanders and
Terry Bradshaw should be lumped together simply because of the
inability to define art in such a manner that lines and boundries can be
drawn.

,And of course, it’s good that lines aren’t being drawn, or else we’d
still be without jazz, the short story, and New J_ournalism...perhaps all
we’d have in 1974 is an etching of a deer on the wall of a cave. But
surely, even without lines, everybody on this campus realizes, with.
what little intelligence some may possess, that there's something very,
very different between the writings of Jacqualine Susann and D.H.
Lawrence. .

Be honest...0K,..now try this one._...The Pittsburgh
Symphony and Three Dog night...UK...now make two lists, one titled
fart, and one art and continue these comparisons and it shouldn’t take
long before one realizes that we don’t have a pollution problem at all,
instead it’s all a matter of the tremendous amount of rich, readily
accepted farters running around letting loose. And their defense for -

' such gross actions? -- the glorious and unlimited boundries of art.

Bullshit I say, BULLSHIT!

You know, it seemsto me it’s a lot like the word love., or as for my
second proposal, the word...shove. For shove all too often seems to be
the closing act to one’s love. Like November 2, 1973...“I love you,
beautiful” and November 2, 1974...“shove it, you ugly little bastard.”
Like art, the word l_ove seems to have eliminated a few rather decent
words from the American language such as friend, attraction, and‘ like.

The whole situation seems quite a shame. I could expound the ,_
positive values of both concepts, love and art, but the space is limited.
And it seems to me that there’s no need for a capped fool to waste your
time. He only asks that a few people who may have not yet considered
the sad distortion of art, spend a bit of time by themselves with a beer

and a James Joyce short story. That’s all.

Symphony Season Begins

 Aging Steinberg Starts 23rd Year -

BY JIM OPPENHEIMIER
The Pittsburgh Symphony Or-

. chestra began its 48th season last

weekend with a program of three
diverse "works, the “Passacaglia
and Fugue in C Minor" by Johann
Sebastian Bach. orchestrated by
Ottorino Resphighi; “Six Pieces for
Orchestra” by Anton Webern; and
(“Symphony No. 3 in E-Flat Major
('Eroica)” by Ludwig van Beet-
hoven. The conductor was William
Steinburg, beginning his 23rd year

' as musical director of the Pitts-

burgh Symphony Orchestra.

This program put the season off to
a fine start. The coming programs
will feature works from different
periods, with an accent on works
solidly established in the basic
repertoire, but not overlooking new
works of quality. At least 20 works
scheduled for performance this
season are 20th century pieces.

Selection of the Bach Passacaglia

an excellent choice. The only Bach

Although it is not that early a work,
it has the energy and drive one

South Oakland Arts Council, the

plays. E -

Jean Anouilh’s Madame De is a
sophisticated, elegant play which,
on the surface, revolves around a
pair of earrings. Madame De sells
the earrings, given to her long ago

buys them and when he is
transferred to France, love and
coincidence conspire to envelop the
diplomat, Monsieur De, Madame
De and the earrings I in an
engrossing predicament.

Unable to evoke the elaborateness
of a realistic setting, the production
uses an imaginatively simple set.

The performers switch effortlessly
between narrating the action and

_ playing their roles.

The ending is disappointing as it
is merely a way to halt the action. It
sheds-"little light on the. characters.
The play rarely probes beneath the
surface to find real personalities in
the characters.

Harold Pinter’s The Lover was
handled in a much different
manner. The stage was cluttered
with home furnishings in an effort
to approximate realism. The Lover
concerns a couple who has let
fantasy predominate their sex
lives. She says she has a lover and
he claims to visit a whore but
instead they enact these roles for

‘each other.

An ambiguous ending leaves one
uncertain as to how much the
couple has let role-playing pre-
dominate in their lives. Written
early in his career, it is not one of
Pinter’s finest plays .but his
trademarks of terse dialogue and
ambiguous atmosphere lift this
play above the ordinary; in addition
it provides some commentary on
the roles of men and women and is
the most substantial play of the
evening.

Prince. A variation on the
children’s fable of the frog who
turns into a prince, this amusing
triﬂe has the sophisticated veneer
of the other plays but less
substantial as it is simply the
dramatization of a joke. ‘

All three plays were acted by
William Beck, Rosemary Margher-
ita, and Michael Mathewson. Beck
and Mathewson deserve praise for

overcoming the potentially detri-‘

mental effects of the use 'of
narration where the audience is left
with" talk instead of action.
Margherita was outstanding in The

Lover but in Madame De her _
performance was occasionally un- '

convincing and mannered. V
Director William Turner varied
the productions to suit the texts.

Loves and Lovers is a compendi-
um of plays that are more good
entertainment than substantial
fare. The occasional skimpiness of
parts of the texts (especially The
Frog Prince‘) detract only slightly
from —a pleasurable evening.

Steinberg Continues Fine Tradition

glected today (our loss), is best
known for his symphonic poem
“The Pines of Rome” (1924), and
the orchestration abilities which
make “The Pines" so popular are
evident in this orchestration.

Unfortunately, the arrangement is
not all it could have been. It starts
at too high a level. and ends at a
level not’ nearly as intense as the
Bach work demands. Also, some of

.. wt,

the runs in the treble voice, which
suggest almost a flowing quality in

the organ version are chopped up

in the Respighi version, destroying
some of the continuityof the work.
However, this is made up for by

the rich, full, and greatly varied
sonorities of which only a full
_f\;orch.estra, especially a great one
"W ‘such as Pittsburgh's, is capable. If
the orchestration is not too faithful

to Bach in some places, it was a
treat in providing a refreshingly
novel view of a familiar work. One

advantage of an orchestration over‘.

the original organ work is‘ the fact it
can distinguish different melodic

lines from one another in a way the
organ can not. I

The second work, “Six Pieces,”
by Webern, was a jump from the
homage to the past of the Bach--
Respighi work to what might well
be called a speculation on the
future. Actuallyiwritten over 60
years ago, the Webem is still a
very modern composition.

It is very short, lasting about nine
minutes, and involves many
fascinating effects. It is atonal--has
no particular key, no real melody or
theme. It shows ‘off aspects of the
orchestra which are seldom dem-
onstrated, such as unique instru-

. mental combinations, and the use

of tone clusters and pointilistic
style. Webern felt he should say
only what was needed to say.

Webern’s atonal style is a foreign
language to most of us.Thus to the
average listener, used to hearing
music involving a great deal of
recapitulation of material, and
based in a more or less definite
key, hearing this sort of work is
very jarring. .

Some authorities assert that
Beethoven composed this sym-

   
    
 
  
  
   
    
 
    
      
     
  
   
     
   
   
  
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
   
   
 

y’s Opener Success 2

' phony to honorthe man he believed

would bring freedom to Europe --
Napoleon Bonaparte. Whether
Bonaparte was inspiration for the

symphony, or whether he was

merely a springboard for Beet-
hoven’s creativity is a moot point.
However, when Napoleon seized
power, and had himself declared
emperor, Beethoven hearing of it,
shouted, in words of real signiﬁ-
cance to us today, “So, then, he is
nothing but an ordinary mortal
after all! He will trample all the
rights of men underfoot to indulge

his ambition, and become a greater

tyrant than anyone!” He tore up
the title page with its dedication, to
Napoleon, and renamed the work
“Heroic Symphony,’ composed to
Celebrate the Memory of a Great
Man”.

The Third Symphony was written
not only at a vitally important time
in Europe, but also in the life of
Beethoven. He had just begun to
realize he was losing his hearing.

IIn the end, he resolved “t‘o take

fate by the throat" and to continue
as a composer.

ing many excellent compositions,
including six more symphonies,‘

suggests that ‘if anyone was the

hero of this symphony, it was
Ludwig van Beethoven. 
Steinberg used no score during

his direction of the Third was

do in this piece, and Steinberg

' turned them loose at the appropri-

In Stadium

BY JIM SPANOS

_  _The Pitt soccer team plays its
» second game of the young season
this evening at Pitt Stadium against
2 cTosstown Point Park College. The
game will begin at 7:30 pm, thanks
 to the addition of.a number of lights
 at Pitt Stadium.
The Point Park squad defeated St.
‘ Francis last week 6-1, and that win
was quite impressive, considering
, the Pioneers were a club and not a
, varsity team last year. The

" rebuilding program at Point Park
_ landed Boni Taylor, a West African
TI soccer player who scored three
goals against St. Francis.

' “Taylor is exceptionally skilled
and can runlike a deer," noted Pitt
soccer coach Leo Bemis. It is
certain that if the Pitt defense is
; able to contain Taylor, their
, ‘chances of victory will be increased
immensely.

Bemis remarked that this even-
+ing's game will be nothing like last
_ year, in which Pitt wo'n easily, 5-O.

“They have a good soccer team,”
Bemis said. “Along with Taylor
.— they have a junior college ~All-Am-
‘erican by the name of John Bollie
who we will have to contend with.
I Last year they were just a bunch of
‘ guys running around, but this year

they will be tougher.” '

. The Pitt student body will have

the opportunity to see Taylor and
I Bollie because the game will be
; played at 7:30 tonight at Pitt
 Stadium.‘ Bemis and the rest of the

soccer team are hopeful a’substan-
tial number of students will attend
‘the game.

“I sure hope we can get the
students out," ’ Bemis said.

Majors

  Still Optimistic  

BY G.W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor
Although the Pitt football team
was successful in gaining a win in
their season opener against the
Florida State Seminoles, nobody
was really too impressed with the
Panthers’ showing. The defense

_ was nothing short of fantastic but

the offense was very erratic and
wasunable to capitalize on num-
erous scoring opportunities.
Nevertheless, head coach Johnny
Majors remains optimistic. He was
not too alarmed with his team’s
showing last Saturday night in
Tallahasse, FL, because as he put

it, “a win, is a win, is a win.” And .

perhaps Pitt’s hard fought 9-6
victory was a blessing in disguise.

“lt’s much better to come back
with a close victory," said Majors
yesterday, speaking at the weekly
Pitt football press luncheon. f‘That
way you won't have a sense of false
‘security. We may have had that
before the game.

“We’ve got to learn to play and
win as favorites," Majors contin-
ued. .“lt’s not easy to learn to play
as favorities, but I don't think we
We
wanted to,win very much.”

Majors was also not very surpri-
sed at the offense’s inability to put
points on the board citing the fact
that the only time the offensive unit
was able to practice together was
last Wednesday and Thursday.
Some hampering injuries to key

Foreman Suffers   Cut,  
Ali Fight Postponed -_

N'SELE—Zaire (AP) A postpone-
ment of. at least one week in the
scheduled Sept. 25 world heavy-.
weight championship fight be-
tween George Foreman and Mu-
hammad Ali was ordered yesterday
-after Foreman suffered a freak cut
over his right eye in a sparring
session.

In New York Video Techniques,
promoters of what is to be the
richest ﬁght ever, announced a
postponement of between one week

and 30 days because of the"

horizontal, one-inch gash Foreman
suffered between his right eye and
eyebrow in an afternoon training
session yesterday.

However, Hank Schwartz, execu-
tive vice president of Video
Techniques, said in an interview
with ABC-TV in the United ‘States
that the postponement would
probably only last from a week to
two or three weeks. '

In an earlier statement, Tshim-

   
 

_pumpu»>W‘a»Tshimpumpn,-zthe Zaire

government press spokesman, said
the ﬁght “-is being put off. We
don’t know how long it will be, but
we feel it will be _a short time.”
Davis Berm/an, a spokesman
for ‘Video Techniques, said in New
York earlier. “The final date will
be announced as soon as all the
parties involved have agreed to the
new date. We are awaiting further
advice from the government of
Zaire, which is on the scene
evaluating the seriousness of the
cut and the medical situation.”

But it had already become clear
here that Foreman’s handlers,
including manager Dick Sadler,
were against having their man
meet Ali on the scheduled date.

There were conﬂicting versions of
the injury’s seriousness. The Zaire
government, which has made
heavy investments in the fight as a
showcase of the importance and
competence of the country, tended

 

   

to minimize the gravity of _ the

Bula Mandungu, president of the
Zaire Title Fight Commission, said.
“I think they’ve dramatized it.
Americans tend to do that. We’re
going to wait a fewdays and see
what shape George is in. Things
are not so serious.”

But Dr. Peter Hacker, Foreman’s
personal physician, gave the view
that apparently caused the post-
ponement. He told a newsman
within an hour after the injury,
“It’s the kind of thing that would
be opened by a moderate blow in a
week’s time.” Thefight was only
eight days away as Hacker spoke.

Foreman went into seclusion at
his villa soon after he suffered the
injury. His eye was bandaged, but
Hacker would not say if he had
taken stitches in it.

Don Elbaum, promoter of the‘

close_d-circuit telecast of the fight at
the Civic Arena, said tickets dated
for next Tuesday would be valid for
the date thcj bout is

    

~ have to improve or the Panthers’ .. 
may not even be in the game. ‘~ ‘

   

players had hindered the progress’,
of the group and as a result their
execution was not what it should
have been.

"We still have a lot of work to
do," said Majors, “but I’m not too
worried because the team is very
enthusiastic and I know they want
to win. The offense showed me
their desire yesterday in practice,
they're working very hard.‘ I

“We’re not a fantastic team yet,”
Majors said. “We can’t.go' out
there and worry that we're not as
good as people think we are. We
have to be careful not to ove1'react __ _
or get alarmed. We have to do our: -2
work and not worry about ourselvesw
We don't want to go out and throw
a scared stick. The biggest thing is
getting rid of that first ball game
and winning it."

 

But after the firstball game comes
the second and Saturday’s game
against Georgia Tech won’t be
quite as easy. After losing to Notre
Dame in their opening game thQ£ 
Ramplin’ Wreck’s came back to"” 
record a big 35-20 victory over
South Carolina. The Yellow Jac-H
kets set a school record of over 500
yards rushing in this game while
running from the wishbone and will
bean excellent test for the strong
Pitt defense.

“We'll face a team that comes at
you from tackle to tackle,” said
Majors. “It will be three back
football as opposed to the two back i *5"
football we faced last week. They '
will be the ﬁrst wishbone team
we’ve faced since I came to Pitt.”

But the Panther defense will be
ready, as they were last week when
they shut off the Seminole ground
attack after the first drive. Pitt’s
defensive alignment‘ will enable
them to put up a nine man front
against the run. With powerful
Gary Burley clogging the middle
and. Tom Perko and Bill Vitale
shutting off the ends, Saturday’s ~

contest should develop into a ﬁerce ‘ A,‘

struggle. But the offense will "

  

The Pitt offense moved the ball
well on -several occasions against
Florida State showing some of the
form which enabled them to set a
school record for total yards a year ‘
ago. The improved play of tight epd
Jim Corbett could be a big factor in
Saturday’s game, and Coach Ma-
jors had nothing but praise for the
Erie, PA native.

“Corbett came through_ as I
thought~he would," Majors said.
“He's the most improvd player on

« the team. He graded higher than — _ ..

any offenseive player and th. 
fourth quarter was his best. He 
blocked very well and caught some
big passes (four receptions for 52
yards). He and Bruce Murphy
were the best players offensively

more first place vote than the
Buckeyes, trailed in third with 928
points. The Sooners needed three
fourth quarter touchdowns to as-
sure a win over a fired-up Baylor
team, 28-11, on Saturday.

“Of course were honored to be
number one," Parseighan said
with a laugh, “but it's where you
wind up after the season that
counts. I'd be happier if it were
January right now." I

In his 10 years at /Notre Dame
Parseighan has lost only 15 of 104
contests.

Nebraska, Alabama, Michigan,
Louisiana State. Penn State, Texas
and Arkansas rounded oilt the
remainder of the first 10 teams.

Penn State and Alabama both
managed to avoid embarrassment
and retain national recognition by
edging their respective opponents
last weekend. PSU opened its
season with a 24-20 win over
Stanford at home while Alabama
gambled on a fourth and five
situation deep in their own territory
by running from a punt formation
to- slip by Maryland, 21-16, at
College Park, MD.

Both Maryland and Southern Cal-
ifornia stayed in the top 20 despite
absorbing defeats. USC, ranked
13, and Maryland, number 14, kept
ahead of PITT and North Carolina
State, who are tied for 15th place.

PITT barely opened its campaign
over Florida State, winless last
year, by a 9-6 margin and tied the
Tarheels [2-0] at 93 points apiece.

forced to hold their breath. In 26

In an effortto claw Pitt way back
up to baseball supremacy in the
East, Coach Bobby Lewis has
announced the resumption of fall
practices. /

Lewis met Monday with most of
last year’s squad, and about 15
aspiring newcomers.

Practice begins today at 4 P.M. at

‘the Trees Hall field. Thursday will

be a day off, but Friday will follow
today's routine.

_ ALBUQUERQUE, N. M.‘
-(AP) —— World light-heavy-
weight boxing champ Bob
' Foster, .34, retired yesterday
after 14 successful title de-
fenses, s a y.i n g he doesn’t
want to battle the world sanc-
tioning bodies. '
-“It’s time to, retire, I
guess,” Foster said. “I still
think ‘I can lick any light-
heavyweight in the world, but
it’s too much of‘a mental
thing to fight the World Box-
ing Association andthe World
Boxing Council, too.” ’ 1
Foster, a sergeant in the”
* Bernalillo County Sheriffs
Department, said boxing “has
been a great li_fe for me. I will
keep close to the ring. ,I
always will. But I intend, to
stay in law enforcement work
for a long while . . .” « ,
Foster leaves the ring as
th e - unbeaten champion,
eclipsing A re hie Moore’s
record of 11 successful title
defenses. ‘ e

the majority of players are still L
in shape from participation during
the summer.

Leading this year’s team are Pete
Martorelli, the senior catcher,
captain for the second straight
year, and Joe Groetsch, elected by
his teammates as last year’s most
valuable player, for his unparallel
ed play at shortstop, and sizzling
bat.

Also returning are senior pitchers V _
Don Siegle and Buster Popovich,.5E
who will give the Panthers \"
experience on the mound. Slick
Scott Sufrin is back for his last

year, too, hopefully wielding his
usually torrid stick.
‘ Glaring holes face Lewis in the
infield, at second and third bases.
He will be. watching closely his
candidates at those positions.

Lewis is eager to get started,

  Physically

PITTSBURGH AP - The.
Pittsburgh Steelers should be in
better physical shape for next
Sunday’s National Football League
game at Denver than at any time
since training camp opened, a club_
spokesman said Tuesday.

Not ‘only did the team come
through the season-opening, 30-0,
win over Baltimore with no serious ‘ 
injuries, tight end John McMakin
should be back in pads after
nursing a bruised stomach muscle
for two weeks.

McMakin started 13 of the 14'
regular-season games last year». In ,_

2 his absence, veteran Larry Brown

and rookie Randy Grossm‘an
alternated against the Colts. 1
Coach Chuck Noll ran ﬁlms of that
game Tuesday, followed by an
optional workout. The club will
begin heavy drills Wednesday in
preparation. for the Broncos.

The Pitt Volleyball Club will meet

.Tuesday, September 24, at 4;15

Decisions will be made regarding
practice schedules, tournaments

The club is open to all University

2 Once again, Penn State will be the
dominant college football team in
the East, with Pittsburgh the leading
ruiinerup, according to the Sep-
ﬁx tember Playboy 1974 Pigskin Pre-

  view. A
The Nittany Lions‘, says Playboy,
are‘ in no danger of losing their

dominance of Eastern college foot- A

ball, but compared with the 1973
team they may seem toothless.
With most of last year‘s enormous
offensive line gone, coach Joe
Paterno will have to abandon his
conservative running game. He"

' must also replace three departed
N.F.L.-caliber linebackers and two
defensive backs.

According to anson Mount, who
writesPlayboy’s Pigskin Preview,

:\ Pittsburgh, last year’s Cinderella
7 team, is much improved in exper-
’ ience, talent, speed and size. The
Panthers’ defense will be impres-
sive but the offensive line and
passing game need work. Last
season’s magnificent freshman
halfback, Anthony Dorsett, may
reach his awesome potential de-
pending on how well he handles
human relations with the people
who block for him.

Temple, comingoff its best sea-
son ever (9-1) in 1973, looks even
stronger this year, and may soon _be
one of the East's strongest teams.

 of fare in the ivy League--the only
