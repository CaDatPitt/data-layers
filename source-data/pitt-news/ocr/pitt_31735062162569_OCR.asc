, to be proud we were able to bring
. Chairman Khrushchev here,” the
'?chancellor said. *

Dr. Litchﬁeld, who presided at
 the luncheon, was both optimistic
V’ . and pessimistic in,his other views
 ‘concerning Khrushchev’s visit to
T’ .”‘Pittsburgh and the university.

 “ Had No Impact

  
  
 

"“It (the ‘visit) didn't do any-’

thing to help him understand the
United’-.States any better,“ the
chancellor stated. Continuing in a
pessimistic vein, . Dr._lLitchﬁeldg re-
marked, “It had no impact on
what he really came over ‘here

}-  to do."

 ' "The chancellor said, however,
 the ‘visit “probably ‘A left him

  was here. In fact, Dr.» Litchﬁeld
*4 said the Russian boss “looked
fresher” than Henry Cabot Lodge,
U. S.. ambassador to the United
Nations. _ I _ i '

 ‘ Mrs. Litchﬁeld, who was seated
. ‘i ‘ -next to Khrushchev at the lunch-
- eon, said. the premier was in a
“very jovial"mood.” »
“He loved the vichyssoise,”
‘she-. said. “In fact, he even said
.».he would like to ‘have another
cup. But then he said he was
‘only joking because his doc-
_ tor said he shouldn’t eat too
,' . much of that. . ' ‘
. “.He said if it weren't for his
-’ . »- doctor, he would really like to
5_-Q1 ha-ve two more cups.”
A Photographers Okay
According to Mrs. Litchﬁeld,
Khrushchev didn’t mind the- pho-
tographers. “I asked him if the
Russians had a word like ‘cheese’,”
. she related. “He said they didn’t
but -that he would like to_ learn
the word. -
, “After that he kept on saying
 -- ‘cheese’ to all the photographers.”
'3 V . ’ Mrs. Litchﬁeld said she asked
 j Khrushchev for some free ad-
’, -_ vice on agriculture since he said
‘ ' he had a. good potato crop at
‘ his farm near Moscow.

But the premier told her he
couldn’t advise her until he saw
the farm. “Then he decided that
wasn't right because it might seem
like he was hinting for an invi-
tation and he said he shouldn’t do
that,” Mrs. Litchﬁeld remarked.

Joked with Gromyko
Mrs. Litchﬁeld also said she was
joking with A. A. Gromyko, Rus-
; A — s,ian_ minister of Foreign Affairs,
.';7 ,1 about the possibility of establish-
__ _-ing a “love—matching” bureau be-

the matter up.” Mrs. Litchﬁeld
remarked.

__  _ In the early, days of this year Aleksei Adzhubei, the son-

dents in the Soviet Union.

Nepomnyashy was one of the
40 Russian journalists chosen to
accompany the Russian party to
the United State.

"Last Thursday, .morning 'Ne-
pomynashy set up shop in the
Russian Nationailty Room in the
Cathedral to record student re-
actions to Khrushchev’s visit to
America and to _Pittsburgh, par-«
ticularly. ..

A group of Pitt women express-
ed the initial reactions that more
exchange of students between

- Russia and‘ the United" States

would create’ an atmosphere’ of
mutual understanding and know-
ledge. — . -

Give Oﬁicial Views

Then with‘ a ﬂourish, a press
attache of the university produced
the president of the debate union
and an editor of the News to pro-
nounce the “official” student op-
inion which would be transmitted
to the homeland by the editor.

Joseph Harsky of the modern
language department 11 i m b l y
acted as interpreter for the con-
versation, although Nepomny-
ashy’s grasp of English was con-
siderable. ‘

The editor first wanted to know
the “leaders’ ” reactions to Khr-
u_shchev’s disarmament proposal
to the United Nations. The debater
expressed the opinion that the en-
tire free world is desirous of just
and lasting peace in a‘ world free

of suspicion, and that the end to

pre-requisite toward that end.
“However, your chair_ma‘n did
not outline any speciﬁc method of
bringing about an agreeable dis-
armament plan, and\ we‘ do not
feel that a plan can work with-
out inspection,” concluded the de-
bater. —

Nepomnyashy vigorously con-
. curred that a system had .to be
worked out before‘ any end to
weapons’ production could be
effectuated.‘ _ _
“Mr. Khrushchev does not want
disarmament without inspection
either,” added the Russian editor.

saw a man with asign saying

‘Disarmament_ with ,or without

mediately, ‘No, that’s wrong.

But didn’t the Soviet“ Union
balk at any mention ‘of controls
at the .year-long Geneva confer-
ence, came ‘a polite query? Mr.
Nepomynashy grumbled a bit and
replied quietly that they must
have been “misunderstood?

He was asked by the news-
man what he thought the Rus-
sian reaction to President Eisen-
hower would bewhen the Pres-
ident returns the visit this win-
ter. _ ..

“The Russian people, especially
the young men and women, are
very eager to meet and welcome

quick grin. “We have received

At. Khrushchev Luncheon

By LES ROTHENBERG

An- element of human drama
was- injected into the otherwise
political atmosphere of the lunch-
eon for Premier Nikita Khrush-
chev last Thursday. An attractive
younglady, Donna Armonas, ac-
companied by a Cleveland news-
paperman, made a dramatiG.ap-
peal to the Russian leader for the
return of her mother and brother
who are now living in Lithuania.

Thousands of television viewers
watching the luncheon activities
saw Miss Armonas approach the
head table and ask the Premier
for his intervention in the matter.

Khrushchev’s ‘reply was .brief
and optimistic: “Little girl, you
can expect your mother back very
soon."

Aided by the help of the editors
of the Cleveland Press and the
Pittsburgh Press, Miss Armonas
managed to obtain the aid of
Pennsylvania’s governor, David L.
Lawrence, in her quest for .the
freedom of the two remaining
members of her; family..-

Nikita Challenge

    

To Keep Promises

Litchﬁeld Tells Premier to Live Up to Word
- That Russia Will Catch, Pass United States

. Chancellor Litchﬁeld topped off the now-celebrated
Nikita Khrushchev luncheon last Thursday afternoon in the
Student Union by challenging the Soviet premier to live up

: to his promises of overtaking the United States in virtually

every ﬁeld of human endeavor.

In a dramatically concise

and vigorous reply following

Khrushchev’s 55-minute speechvlofé

threat and boast, Dr. ‘Litchfield
aﬂirmed that competition is “an

‘essential dynamic in a creative

society.”
A “We don’t challenge your slo-
gan to ‘overtake and pass Amer-
ica; we just challenge your abil-
ity to do it,” he declared, in an
obvious rebuttal to the rotund
Russian’s repeated assertions of
Soviet plans for the future.
. Competition Welcomed‘
“We believe that when you have

. a competitor, you do better,” con-

tinued the chancellor. “We wel-
come the competition!”
xhitchﬁeld closed his brief re-
~mark/s. with ‘the hope the two
-nations could develop societies
inwhich men would be free to
fulﬁll their natural potentiali-
ties, where truth would be a
Jnutual and constant objective.

The benefits of this sort of
peaceful “competition” would ac-
crue to mankind, in the largest
sense.

May Have Agreed

The Soviet chairman shook his
head in apparent approval, and
probably would have replied that
he heartily agreed had he been
given the opportunity to take the
lectern again. ,

However, his own speech had
consumed more time than’ had
been allotted to. it on the -ultra-
tight tour schedule.

Khrushchev boldly reasserted
the intention of his nation to
“gallop ahead” on its seven-year
plan of expansion and industrial
growth. , '

“You will hear our whistle in
the distance and you will then
know we are coming,” he po-
etically asserted in the prepared
speech which was read with
ﬁnesse by his interpreter, Vic-
tor Sukhodrev.

Continuing this metaphor
Khrushchev predicted that soon
"we will catch up with you, sal-
ute you, and pass on ahead.”

Not Always Leader

As if to prove that this vision
could in fact come about, Khrush-
chev reminded his 1arge,.attentive
audience the United States’ was

‘ not always the leader of the world

in wealth and power. L

“Remember that once you,
yourselves, were second to an-
other great nation,” he stated.
"But through diligence and
labor you attained the position

you now hold. It is our inten-
tion to replace you in that posi-
tion in the near future.”

Again to support his argument,
Khrushchev quoted statistics of
various phases of Russian indus-
try which purportedly demon-
strate already Soviet superiority.
He also boasted that the reports
on the first year of the expansion
program indicate complete fulfill-
ment of goals, in some cases
quotas surpassed.

Liked Invocation

In a twenty-minute “off the
cuff” remarks, which made up the
last part of his address, the popu-
lar head of the communist regime
thanked the various hosts of his
Pittsburgh stay. He told The Rev.
Howard C. Sharfe he appreciated
his invocation prayer for peace,
and in the same breath expressed
gratitude to Bishop John Wright
for his instructions to his people
on proper. behavior during the
Russian visit. » “ -

This was followed by the sur-
prising statement from , the
avowedly atheistic A leader that
ﬂue religious leaders of -the So-

 

viet Union were united in their
prayers and desires for peace.
The “peace” theme was repeat-
ed on every convenient occasion:
economic c0—existence can be
peaceful, all weapons for waging
war should be melted into instru-

ments of peace, peace. is the
natural state of mankind.
Emphasized Friendliness
Khrushchev grew more em-

phatic as the unprepared segment

of his speech wore on; he gestured» i

broadly with a waving right fist
and emphasized his friendliness
with outstretched palms at each

‘mention of world cooperation.

Khrushchev p r a I s e d Gov.
David L. Lawrence of‘ Pennsyl-
vania for his oratorical abilities,
demonstrated in the opening -

. speech of the luncheon program.

Thesilver-haired executive had _

concluded a short, but aggressive-
ly emphatic speech by stating that
the American people would follow
President Eisenhower where he
leads;
State Plays Part

His theme was the role which
Pennsylvania has continuously
played
American democracy. “The ex-
pansion of our democratic pro-
cesses and the enlargement of our

' opportunities” was‘ how the Gov-

ernor phrased it.

In a series of negative declara-
tive statements Gov. Lawrence de-
lineated the position of the United
States: '

"We have no fear of peaceful
competition. We do not want to
destroy what has. been so pain-
fully built up, in this or in any
other land. We are not an em- A
ployers’ nation. We are not a
one-party nation.”

The United States delegate to
the United Nations, Henry -Cabot
Lodge, expressed his satisfaction
with his just-completed task of
accompanying Khrushchev on his
tour of America.

He ﬁnished his address by quot-
ing Thomas Jefferson’s famous
lines from the Declaration of In-
dependence, “We hold these truths
to be self-evident . . .”

Qn Soviet Idea
Of Education

“Khrushchev and the Central
Committee Speak on Education,”
by George S. Counts, recently
published by the University press,
is the second book in the Studies
of Comparative Education Series.

Dr. Counts’ book presents an
analysis of each of the 48 thesis of
the Central Committee of the
Communst' Party and the Council
of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.

These theses, approved on Nov.
12, 1958 by the ruling body of
the Soviet empire, have launched
a program for the radical recon-
struction of the entire Soviet
school system from kindergarten
through the universities.

According to the author, the
proposed reconstruction of the So-
viet .school system will facilitate
the goal of the Soviet Union to
surpass the United States.

Dr. Counts is professor emeritus
of education, Teachers’ College,
Columbia University and visiting
professor of education here.

Luncheon Brings Out Humor

In SoViet’s Number One lllan

Khrushchev Enjoys Good Time
With Chancellor, U.N. Delegate

A man came to lunch here last Thursday and created
even more excitement than last year’s 29-26 upset football

win over Notre Dame.

The man was Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, chairman
of the Council of Ministers’ of the Union of.Soviet Socialist
Republics. The occasion that caused all the excitement was

_a luncheon given in‘ the man’s%

honor by Chancellor Litchﬁeld,
Gov. David Lawrence of Pennsyl-
vania and Mayor Thomas Galla-
gher.

At times the two hour and 25
minute affair in the Student Union

, Ballroom and Supper Room moved

along at such a light, good-na-
tured and humorous pace that the
serious moments seemed only to
be interruptions.
A Chancellor Starts
Chairman Khrushchev himself
and Chancellor Litchﬁeld con-
tributed most to the pleasant in-
formalityof the luncheon.

The chancellor, who presided,
started it off by relating to the
approximately 500 guests a re-
mark Mrs. Nina Khrushchev had .
made to him.

“The people here are so large,”
Mrs. Khrushchev said. “Do you
mean they 'are -"quite tall?” Dr.
Litchﬁeld asked. The ﬁrst lady of
the Soviet Union answered, “No,
I mean big.”

EveI'ybody’s Happy

A few minutes later,’ while Dr.
Litchﬁeld was introducing the 28
other dignitaries seated at the
head table, a waitress dropped a
tray full of dishes, causing a mild‘
disturbance. —

Khriishchev interrupted Dr.
Litchﬁeld by announcing to
everyone, with a broad grin, this

-accident was “an evidenceVof

*5 happiness.”

The Russian leader interrupted
again as the chancellor said he
would‘ pass by introducing Mr.
Khrushchev for a while. Daugh-
ingly, Khrushchev" said, “That’s
discrimination.” _ ,

Calls Himself Burden , ,

S, ii 0 r tfl y after Khrushchev’
reached the mid-w‘ay point of this

.55-minute address, he spentva few
‘minutes joking back and forth.

with his host and escort during the
nationwide _ tour, Henry Cabot

Lodge, U_.S. ambassador to the

United Nations.

The chairman offered that
Lodge would be relieved to see
him leave because he had been
“a burden” to the ambassador.

“I” enjoyed every minute of it,”
Lodge broke_in. Khrushchev‘ re-

7,p1ied:_ “You’ll probably say, ‘I’m

seeing you off with the greatest of

peasure.’ What’s wrong with that?

Don’t you want to send me off?
Do you want it to be a bad send-
ing off” . ‘

statements. '.
In . referring to Gov. Law-
rence’s p r e v i o u s statements
about the two-party system in

the United States, Khrushchev
said. “Well God knows the dif-

. ference between the two _par-

ties; I don’t know.”

And another time, “May God
give us strength to solve‘ matters
by reason,“ not for force.”

At the beginning of‘ the lunch-
eon, when the Rev. Howard C.
Scharfe gave the invocation,
Khrushchev looked around at the

bothered by the heat of the tele-

All told, the luncheon guests
listened to 77 minutes worth of
remarks, addresses and rebut-

"this statement, a lone hand clap

was heard. It was that of Chair-

The lungheon, scheduled to.
begin at 1 p.m., didn’t get un--

the ﬁrst guests who were to sit

at the head table took their V

A minute later Mrs.—Nina
Khrushchev, escorted_by Dr. Wil-

Then came Ambassador Lodge,
Gov. Lawrence, Dr. Litchﬁeld and
Chairman Khrushchev. At this
point the guests, situated at 52 ta-
bles, rose to their feet and gave
Khrushchev loud applause. He,

too, returned the gesture but not

as heartily as his wife.

Behind the head table were
seven ﬂags. From left. to right
were the U.S. flag; the ﬂag of
the Soviet Union with a gold

»hammer and sickle on a red

background: the U.N. flag with
that body’s symbol in white
against a blue background; the
Pennsylvania state ﬂag; the
black and gold city of Pitts-
burgh ﬂag: the university ﬂag;
and the Pittsburgh Bicentennial
ﬂag. ‘

Included among the guests were
persons from all walks of life.

Nine university students and one

representative each from Chat-
ham, Mount Mercy. and Carnegie
Tech were present. Duquesne was
not included because classes there
have not been resumed.

They,
along with university students and
faculty, saw the luncheon pro-
ceedings on television monitors
set up at various parts of the
campus.

’ At 3:40, approximately one
hour behind the planned sched-
ulc, the Khrushchev party was
swiftly ushered to the Terrace
entrance ‘to the Union, out to
the waiting cars and then to the
Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

As Khrushchev left the Ball-
room, he received another stand-
ing ovation, his fourth of the day.

Minutes rater the crowds dis-
persed from outside the Union.
Some persons ‘made their way to
the Ballroom for a curious look at
the luncheon set up.

Very quickly, however, ‘the

Hospital Tour

4 Greeted by Mrs. Litchﬁeld, sev-
eral ladies of the University and
Walter Rome, director of Chil-
dren‘s Hospital, Mrs. Khrushchev
and her party were conducted on
-a tour of the hospital. .

Seemingly oblivious to the
barrage of newsmen and pho-
tographers surrounding her.
Nina Khrushchev never lost her
smiling, serene charm. VVhile at
the hospital, she at one point
embraced two children in hos-
pital gowns and gently ad-
monished their mother, “Take
care of tlcm. It is so crowded
here.” A «t

On leaving the hospital, Mrs.
Khrushchev was driven to the
Cathedral of Learning.

Entering the Fifth Avenue door,
Mrs. Khrushchev and her party
were shown through the.Commons
Room, where the principal be-
hind the building of the Cathedral
was explained to them.

Russian Room Enjoyed -

A Theresa Sirianni, a student
hostess, accompanied by Miss
Shirley Ritz, then took Mrs.
Khrushchev through several in-'
ternational rooms. They visited
the Russian - room, which Mrs.
Khrushchev especially seemed to
enjoy, the Norwegian room. and
the Yugoslav room.

In the Yugoslav room the
group found ‘a class in session.
Mrs. Khrushchev made a point
of going back to. apologize to

that most houses in the Soviet?

the instructor of the class for
interrupting it.

The ladies were then conducted
to the 12th ﬂoor, where they, with

the rest of the party, were served’

coffee and cinnamon rolls by stu-
dent hostesses, and the Dean of
Women’s staff.

The members of the press
were excluded from this gather-, _
ing so the ﬁrst lady of the So-
viet Union could relax. She was
then shown the Babcock room
on the 39th floor by Mrs. Litch-
ﬁeld before proceeding to the
luncheon. From the Babcock_
room Mrs. Khrushchev re-
marked that Pittsburgh “Re-

g — Harriers Lose

 Season Opener

 

27-30 To S.R.

The Panther cross—country team
was nosed out, 27-30, by a strong
Slippery Rock squad. Saturday
afternoon.

The meet was started just be-
fore the half-time of the Slippery
Rock-Edinboro football game, and
ﬁnished on the ﬁeld as part of the
half-time festivities. '

Hot and. humid weather made

the 4.5 mile course especially
difficult for all the harriers. Pan-

,th‘er.Ron Rush turned in the out-

stanciing. performance of the day.
Rush was the meets individual
winner with a time of 25 minutes
57 seconds.

,Rus’_h lead all the way" and
after the first half assumed
such a commanding lead that
there wasn’t much doubt who"
‘would be first to cross the ﬁnish
line. Theﬁeld was spread out

and there wasn’t a close race in ‘

‘t,he_meet. ' .
Coach Carl Rees said-, “I was
very pleased with my ﬁrst three

starters, Rush, Reed Clark and -
' Mickey Jupina who ﬁnished first,
‘second,

and. ﬁfth respectively.”
They did a good job, the kind of

'_ a job that will win some meets

for us.

‘Slippery Rock was in -terriﬁc
‘shape and they were ready for
‘us. The 'Rocketshaven’t lost a
cross-country meet since the

.They are now riding a 14 meet

Penn‘ State:

By JACK SMITH

Last week in a practice scrim-
mage with Beadling, an amature
soccer team composed of many
former college standouts, the Pan-
thers came out on the short end
of a 4-1 sc01‘e.

So with another week of prac-

tice completed and the season
opener with Slippery ‘Rock only
a few days away, Coach Leo
Bemis is F-‘till pondering the scor-
ing question. _ 2 - iatlﬂ
_ The only Cat score came when
sophomore Don Jerich drove in a
penalty kick. As for the other
linemen, they were unable to cap-
italize on their scoring opportu-
nities.

On the other hand Bumper
Seminick pumped in_ three of
Beadling’s four goals. Last year
-Seminick was leading scorer of
the Keystone league, and scored
10 goals in one game. Beadling
was ranked last year as sixth in
the Nation among amateur and
. semi-professional teams.

All was not -gloom for the Blue
and Gold, however, for ﬁne per-
formances were turned in by cen-
ter‘-fullback Kal Smith, inside Bob
'McNul_ty and-goalie George Zani-
copolous. From all indications Za-
tnicopolousg has the makings of a

. ﬁne. goalie.

Bemiskhad this to say about
~ his team’s eﬁott, “I admit we
don’t‘ seem to have‘ that potent
scoring punch yet. but I do feel
-we have a good ball club. The
team has a lot of spirit and"
works hard. With a_ little. _more
-polish we could‘ have a real good
- college team.”

In «a JV-Freshmen scrimmage
held last week. the two teams bat-
tledto a 1-1. tie. Scoring the only

“The public is reading Books. More books are sold every
year and they are books of a rising caliber,” observed Bennett
Cerf, noted author and ‘publisher during his appearance at 
the Midday Series last week. ; \

is that everyone wants to readbooks that are on the best-
seller list, books with current rep--O

Regardless, there is still a
great opportunity for new writ-
ers, especially in radio and tele-
- vision work. He also said that
the demand for “the light touch" He also referred to them as
