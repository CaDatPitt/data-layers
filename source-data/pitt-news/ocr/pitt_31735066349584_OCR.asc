Vol. 70, No.J(f7g_

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The secret report recommending
that assistant professor Paul Nyden

' be denied another contract with

Pitt's sociology department deals
primarily with criticism of his
research and publications, a
conﬁdential University source has
revealed. '

The 14-page document has
ﬁgured prominently in the contro-

fiaersy surrounding Nyden’s upcom-
Wing dismissal and was the ﬁnal

effort of a three-man committee
charged in January with reviewing
his work‘ prior to a possible
recommendation for promotion.

The report discusses at length
two publications submitted by
Nyden to the review committee,
according to the source, including
his doctoral dissertation on coal
miners and labor unions and a
more recent work for publication in
a book by Pitt professor Paul
Lazarsfeld.

The major reservations express-

‘aged in the report concerned Nyden’s

allegedly poor grasp of scholarly
works in research areas overlapp-
ing his own. This criticism was
mentioned in regards to Nyden’s,
doctoral dissertation, with the
paper for Lazarsfeld’s book receiv-
ing a page-by-page critique in an
appendix to the report, the source
‘said.

teacher's strike.

“Overall the secret report deals
with Nyden’s academic work,
teaching methods, and administra-
tive role, as well as his community
service," the source said.

In the area of teaching method,
the report criticizes Nyden’s
instruction of a seminar course in
Marxist thought for the orthodoxy
of reading materials. Nyden

allegedly omitted “dissenting” '

voices in the Marxist spectrum, the
source said. I

The document also expressed
dissatisfaction with Nyden’s ad-
ministrative work in the sociology
department, alleging he handled
poorly the coordination of an
applied sociology program, accord-
ing to the source.

In the area of community service
the report notes Nyden’s participa-
tion in black community concerns
and in the recent city-wide
“There
critical evaluation made however, it
just states that the committee is
aware of his community activities
in these areas," the source
commented.

The bulk of the negative
recommendation stemmed from
criticism of Nyden’s "research,
although, it commented that he
showed favorable promise as an
instructor and “could develop into
a good teacher over a period of
time," the source said.

Romanovvs ki Wins SGS

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Wayne Romanowski was elected
president of the 1976-77 School of
General Studies (SGS) student
cabinet by a light voter turnout in
this week's election.

Only about 7% of SGS's 7,000 /

students cast ballots in the
elections held Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.

Bill Bair, Edith Gibson, Kathy
Gubala and current council mem-
ber Patti Thompson won council
seats.

Romanowski, who was unoppos-
ed for president. attributed the low
voter turnout to student apathy and
lack of interest to to the absence of
presidential candidates.

“There's no doubt that there
was an interest loss with no one
else running for president," said
Romanowski. ‘.‘It wasn't a very
exciting contest in that regard."

Romanowski's prime goal will
be to build student interest and
involvement in SGS affairs. 7

“General Studies students aren't
the same as day students." said
Romanowski. “Since most of them

Secret Nyden Report

_ (Continued from Page I)
mittee conducted extensive inter-
views with all department mem-
bers as well as the review of
Nyden’s published work.

Release of the 14-page document
to Nyden has been complicated by
concerns over the possibility of
legal actions stemming from the
material in the document and the
worry that release could hamper
frank discussions of other promo-
t,  cases in the sociology
department and the University as a
whole, according to a ..second
source in FAS close to the
deliberation process.

The Nyden controversy surfaced
two weeks ago with the release of
an open letter by Nyden claiming
political interests had ﬁgured in the
negative recommendation issued
by the steering committee.

A student group formed to
support Nyden’s case has demand-
ed the release of the 14-page

document and demanded the
negative decision be reversed.
Presently all materials pertain-
ing to the case are in the hands of
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg and John
Armstrong, chairman of the Uni-
versity Senate committee on
Tenure and Academic Freedom.
Sociology chairman Burkart
Holzner has called for a complete
investigation of the Nyden contro-
versy by_ the Senate committee in
an attempt to dispel accusations
that normal procedures for promo-
tional consideration were violated.
The Senate Committee is expected

to take action on the Nyden case

within the next two weeks.

Rosenberg will make his own
determination of the case and
decide, whether to release the
14-page secret- report to Nyden,
who has said he will make it public
upon his receipt.

a Pitt Wins In

Air Pollution
Appeal Case  

Common Pleas Judge S. Louis
Farino ruled yesterday that Pitt
was not guilty of a 13-minute air
pollution violation last August 27..

“It was not established that it

was Pitt which caused the
pollution, because of the various
other institutions which use the
incinerator,” Judge Farino said.

Theiruling came as the result of
an appeal of a November 12
decision by retired Magistrate John
Chandler. Chandler had ﬁned the
University 200 dollars.

The alleged violation was sup-
posedly caused by the burning,
done by area hospitals, of dead cats
and dogs and leftover parts of
bodies in the Scaife hall incinera-
tor. These were stored in
styrofoam containers which could
not be opened by University
maintenance employees because of
health precautions.

‘ A heavy black smoke was

emitted, caused mostly by the

styrofoam, which produced an air
pollution violation.

The University had argued that it
had no control over what was
burned in the incinerator because.
area hospitals use it free of charge.
Since it was providing a public
service and could not tell what was
being burned, the University
argued it should not have to pay the
ﬁne.

SCATH To Apply For
Official SG Recognition   [

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Student Coalition Against Tui-
tion Hikes (SCATH) members
voted yesterday to apply for
recognition from the Student
Government Committee on Student
Organizations (CSO).

SCATH members said they will
begin work on a constitutionwhich
they will submit to CS0 in the
beginning of spring term.

“If we are recognized it would
mean we would be continuing all
next year,”, SCATH member Irene
Kugler said. “We should begin to
think in long terms.”

Recognition by Student Govern-
ment would allow SCATH to apply
for up to $100 in allocations and
provide them with a supply of
paper and use of ofﬁce space.

“Right now we have a problem
with money, paper and using ofﬁce
machines. Recognition should take
care of that,” Kugler said.

SCATH also voted to have a
rally, possibly featuring a musical
group as well as speakers, in order
to reach larger numbers of students

'and educate them.

_- “We should have the rally, ” said
SCATH member Charles Ogg. “If

. SGB Needs Support

Former Senator Adlai Stevenson once remarked we pick a President,
and then we pick on him during his term of office. Such has been the
fate of the Student Government Board at Pitt.

The unkindest cut of all came when only 1,400 of 13,000 students
even bothered to vote. Immediately, SGB candidates knew most of the

I ’Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH) and SGB last week and the

SGB participation, or lack of it, in the Nyden controversy.
According to SCATH spokesmen, only the group that gets mass

student support can legitimately speak for the students.

SGB,

according to some SCATH members, lacks this support and because of
this" SGB methods for dealing with the proposed tuition hike are

ineffective.

While we openly recognize the need for SCATH, we hope that it
won’t increase the confusion and apathy most students feel toward
campus politics by questioning the validity of SGB’s involvement in the

tuition issue.

If student apathy increases, there can only be -less of the “avenues

‘ for creating‘ student involvement”

at Pitt that SCATH craves. As

apathy increases, the amount of students turning out to vote each year

0 decreases, thus making SGB more ineffectual—which makes the

students more apathetic. It’s a nasty circle that ‘must be broken.

In the Nyden controversy, SGB should, and indeed wishes to
represent the best interests of the student body. The main student‘
input, however, has come from an ad hoc group of students that held a

sit-in in the sociology department.

Both those students and the

administration failed to recognize the possible contributions SGB could

have made in the affair.

The student body has a right tobe represented in both the tuition

~_ 3 ’l ‘ hike issue and the Nyden affair. SCATH was not elected: nor were the
' A 50 or so students involved in the sit-in. We are not against student

groups getting involved in campus politics; nor are we disagreeing with

_ the SGB. We feel, in fact, that any student participation at any level in

campus politics is a good thing. But automatically branding SGB
ineffectual further reduces the power of the group that represents the

largest portion of the student body.

SGB President Barry Weisband has said, “We’re
legitimate, and we have a purpose.’

The SGB does have a purpose.

here; we're

!

There is a deﬁnite need for an

organization that can represent the student body and maintain close, if

of topics. SGB fulﬁlls this role.

~ not always cordial, relations with the administration on a wide variety .

We recognize the need for student coalitions such as SCATH to deal
in specialized areas. But even though they are specialized, that
doesn't mean they should ignore, or downplay, the right—and
duty—of the SGB to represent the student body.

Letter

It is typical behavior for those

who wish to destroy our basic
freedoms to reinterpret the U.S.
Constitution in a manner -which
appears to support what they want
to say. Such would appear the case
in the Dan Mulholland editorial on

Senate Bill One (S-l). To equate

the concept of “tranquility" with

“liberty" is patently absurd.

.Any government so inclined
could rather effectively “insure
domestic tranquility" by the
diffusion of tranquilizing gases or
other chemicals into our atmo-
sphere or water supplies and in the
Mulholland mentality this would
“—-In fact enhance our liberties!”
The proposal for legalizing the
“Gestapo-like" procedures set

forth in some sections of Senate Bill

One is indeed a frightening
prospect to any professor who has
lived through the Joseph McCarthy
era and the more recent revelations
of the behavior of some of our
nation’s most powerful leaders and
their operatives in the various
national security agencies and
bureaus. '

Sitting Out the Election

BY TOM WASELESKI

’ It’s ironic to see Jimmy Carter,

sweep primary after primary when
George McGovern did the same
thing four years ago only to later be
regarded as a political idio-
syncrasy.

The tragic edge to the irony is
the fact recently recounted in the
New York Times, that there are no
longer the droves of student
volunteers working for the election
of presidential candidates. So while
today’s contenders, and especially
the Democrats, try to showcase
their youthful support, these
tokens, thrust before the glare of
television lights, are only shadows

of the student mobs that sought to.

place McGovern in the White
House. ’
The door-to-door campaigning in
1972 was a test not only for
McGovern, but also for youth
acceptability. ‘Student volunteers
showed up on porches and door-
steps, usually in jeans, although in
the cleanest pair we had. '
We were campaigning not only
against Nixon and against a war we

had tried to believe was over, but ,

also against that post-Sixties image
of the washed-up young activists.
For once, we said, we’d try it
through the system. As a matter of
fact, we had little choice, for after

 Rise of Neo-Fascism

believes his own words, he will
certainly have no difficulty in
closely identifying with a number
of the candidates from the major
political parties.

We have only recently in our
history removed one leader with
dictatorial attitudes; in our national
efforts to resolve the causes of our
rising crime rate. let us not elect
another potential dictatoreno mat-
ter how benevolent! But “that
.couldn't happen in America,”
could it?

the government’s campus shoot--

ings, the student factor in
American politics was in its last
days. Little did the thousands of
McGovernites realize that this was
to be the end of the line.

IMPRESSIONS

I remember talking to beer-bel-
lied men after they had just

‘finished their supper, the rush of

tap water and the clatter of dishes
coming from inside the house.
They didn’t know McGovern so
they couldn’t vote for him—quite a
contrast to today’s Carter followers
who don’t know him either, but will

‘ profess their support because he’s

“fresh," an adjective used by PR
agents instead of the more apt
‘ ‘politically unknown . ’ ’

The man said he'd probably vote
for Nixon. Iwrote it down. He said
he didn’t think things were sobad.
He was working, his family was
satisﬁed. I asked him if he thought
his paycheck went any further since
Nixon had been in office. He said
he really didn’t know, ‘that his wife
did all the shopping. I asked if he

would bring her out. He said he’d.

ask her, but he didn’t think she’d
come because she never voted.
She came out wiping’ her red
hands with the dish towel. I asked
her if she thought she could buy
more groceries this year with ten
dollars than she could four years
ago. She laughed and said anybody
knew you couldn’t, but what could
you do about it. I told her I could
re-activate her voter registration
and she could tell the President
what she thought. She laughed

again and said that wouldn’t make V

any difference.

I noticed some kids in their yard
and asked the couple if any of them
would be going to college. The man
said maybe the oldest would go;
they’d have to see later if they
could afford to send the rest. I told
them both Nixon and McGovern
felt every child had the right to go
to college, but only McGovern was
willing to provide the money
needed to send them.

I then asked what they knew of
Kent State, and they said they
thought a mob of students that
were setting fire to the campus
were asked to go home. Instead,
they told me, they beat several
policemen, shooting one, and so

the police shot back in self-defense. ’

They said they weren't sure,
though, because they hadn't .read
about it in the paper. I told them
the real story, and said that if it had
come four years later it couldve
been me on the concrete, a few
years more and it could've been
their elde'st. ,

I made a couple of trips to their

' place answering questions about

McGovern and encountered other V

households like theirs.

We volunteers used to hold our
strategy meetings not in smoky
rooms, but in park amid all the
evening honeysuckle balm of y
summer. We took great pride.-{$3. e

A term “grass roots,” as if the media

were calling each one of us by
name. i

The night McGovern won the
nomination I was in Detroit, far
from my fellow campaigners and..in
a houseful of sleeping people. I
went to bed at four knowing that
having swept the Democrats,
McGovern could do the impossible
against Nixon, too.

But the Eagl_eton affair and the
minimum income proposal caused

problems in answering’ skeptics.‘

WE moved on undaunted, ‘ .-

ever, proud to be for once out or me ‘

streets and in the middle of the
most orderly coup in the history of
democracy. There was nothing we
couldn’t do by one-on-one talking,
“grass-rooting it." A
The’ Democrats, however, were
little help to us. They had their

“organization” and their regulars, -

and never once believed George
could pull off the convention until
he actually did. After that they
wanted no part of us because we’d
beaten them, which was probably
worse than Nixon beating them for
the simple. fact we weﬂyt
supposed to. -1

The night the electon results
rolled in must have been a decisive
day for a lot of people. Aside from
the solid drubbing for which we all
pitied ourselves, * it appeared a
victory for future cigar-room
politics, with not only the Ricard
Nixons reasserting their power, but
the Richard Daleys and the George
Meanys, too. '

They were telling us, “We don’t
like your personable style, and
even though you stayed out of the
streets and did it our way for a
change, you didn’t work with
us-—you had your own ideas.”

And so now the McGovern
convention reforms have b
largely rewritten, the MCGOVE}
party chairman has long been

replaced, and it's back to the .

donkey and the elephant and red,
white and blue bumper stickers.

Sadly, there's a tremendous
feeling of power one has in sitting
out this election. They say we’ve
gone after jobs, after the books.
and are a more "intelligent"
breed.

Some have observed that we now
are backxin the fold, espousing the
politics. music and business
mannerisms of our fathers. ut
there are thousands _of usgt

Jiaekson who tend to isagree.

Professor Roublev's

Version lnco rrect

In his letter.Professor Michel
Roublev offers an interpretation of
the fate of his candidacy for tenure,
and then delivers a scurrilous
attack on Dean Rosenberg. I
believe that Mr. Roublev’s version
of the history department’s course
of action is incorrect, but under-
standable in that he was not
himself present at tenure meet-
ings, and is restating in polemical

.terms what may have been

reported to him. His account of
what happened to his dossier after
it left the department is a subject

authoritatively. -

The accusation that Mr. Rosen- ‘

berg. is lashing back at Mr.
Roublev’s union activities

however, another matter. “I can
only speculate,” Mr. Roublev
begins. “A further cause might
be," he continues. “From this

~perspective," he concludes. The '

perspective _tells us something
about Mr. Roublev, but nothing at
all about Mr. Rosenberg.

For a professional association to
make Mr. Roublev’s innuendoes
their own is—I. choose the mildest
word I know—distasteful.

What is the Pitt Professional Ilnion‘.-’

Oll Ten Reasons Not to Vote for PPII

The PLRB ruling of March 15 on the run-off election for March 30 and 31 provides
a dramatically clear choice for the faculty ‘of the Provost's area. Faculty members
who have already been sold'on the ideological value of unionism will vote for PPU.
We warn the rest of our colleagues—let the buyer beware.

Many of the implications of being represented by PPU as Local 3414 of the Amer-
ican Federation of Teachers—AFL/CIO are not universally appreciated by the po-
tential members of the bargaining unit. We believe that if they are,,the faculty will
choose to keep their options open by an overwhelming votefor NO REPRESENT-
ATIVE. We have said little in previous bulletins about PPU because we did not ex-
pect it to get to the run-off. The fact that is has done so is probably more of a
tribute to the organizational skill and dedication of its membership than to the

basic appeal of the AFT program if that is clearly understood. The facts which we ’

present below are verifiable public knowledge and contrast sharply with the com-
forting rhetoric of the recent PPU statement which asks, -"Who's Afraid of the
PPU?" As the writers of that statement apply, many people are worried about being
represented by the PPU. Here are some of their reasons.

1.) PPU _is the union local for the American Federation of'Teachers (AFT), a mil-

tant trade union group which normally makes no pretense of being a professional
union ,of the AAUP type. Although AFT has recently become the bargaining agent
for the New York and Florida University systems its membership is predominetly
drawn from secondary and high schools.4Thus, out of thirty vice presidents- in the
huge union bureaucracy only one comes from an institution of higher learning (see
Chronicle of Higher Education, July 21, 1975).

2.) PPU has mailed out a series of position papers describing programs and resolu-‘

tions to which many of the faculty could happily subscribe. They have astutely
avoided any implication that PPU can guarantee or promise to deliver these benefits.

Presumably the writers know that the ultimate contract must be acceptable to both
parties and that many of their proposals may be ruled as not-bargaining unless the
University bargainers agree. Since the_AFT has a record of hard-nosed adversarial
negotiations we expect that the University would yield the minimum in such deal-
ings. The recent ‘Court decision remanding twenty-one non-bargainable items back
to PLRB after four years of litigation leaves such matters as the possibility for
faculty input to library planning or University governance in‘ limbo. We do not
question the desires of PPU to raise the issues described in their position papers. We
simply think it is unrealistic to suppose they could implement more than a fraction
of them with legal force.

‘ 3.) Under the militant leadership of AFT-PPU therefis high likelihood of a faculty‘

strike. If this sounds far-fetched, note that of the only two AFT institutions of
higher learning in Pennsylvania (Robert Morris College and Moore College of Art),
the former has already gone through a bitter strike. AFT also represents three two
year community colleges in Pennsy|vania—A|legheny County, Bucks County and

Reading Area. Allegheny has already been struck. Such actions are consistent with.

the Ladd-Lipset Survey report in Chronicle of Higher Education for February 17,
1976, which shows that (77%) of AFT officers identify themselves as miltants (9%

for AAUP) and clearly endorse the use of strikes and picketing. Faculty members _

who have found the present campaign trying may imagine the acrimony and ten-
sion of a strike with picket lines.

4.) Although AFT union locals such as PPU may maintain considerable autonomy
they are clearly tied to an enormous power structure which expects something
back for what it gives. The announcement in December of a unanimous vote of sup-
port by PPU of the Pittsburgh AFT school strike is not so surprising when viewed

' in the context. As a member of an AFL-CIO union local you may be expected or

pressured to support off-campus political positions in which you do not believe.
AFT traditionally offers much local freedom and autonomy during their organiz-
ing phase (as PPU is doing). After the election, union discipline tends to tighen up.

5.) With PPU as your exclusive legal bargaining agent you will no longer be .able to
negotiate matters having to do with your salary or working conditions with your

Shepard, J. Williams, R. Wynn, P. Stehle. * ;

department head or dean. Indeed, under the PLRB ruling for Pitt your department
chairman will no longer be working with or for you and your colleagues—he will
legally be on the management side of the bargaining table. ‘

6.) The Pitt administration has taken the position that the faculty s_hould not be
divided into separate bargaining units. lf PPU wins in the run-off the Provot’s area
will indeed be separated from the rest of the University. As a result, the University
could be expected to file exceptions which could result in lengthy administrative
and court proceedings. One can only speculate as to when negotiations would be
concluded and pay increases effected. One may note that even without such delays,
Temple's July 1, 1973, salary increase was not negotiated nor paid until September,
1974. At Cooper Union, bargaining has gone on for over eleven months with no
agreement, no pay raises, just expensive legal talk.

7.) Contrary to PPU literature, a vote for unionism guarantees that we will pay a *
price in the generation of new bureaucracies at Pitt. We will pay twice, first with .
our union dues and second by the drainage on university resources to finance them.-‘.
new load of legal grievance and procedural work on the "Management” side of the
table. At Youngstown State‘University the new Office of Faculty Personnel already
costs over _$70,000 per year justfor staff costs. The added bill for legal expenses is
not forseeable. The cost to faculty in lost time can never be measured.

  
   
  
 

8.) AFT bargainers record of sensitivity to faculty interests shows some astounding
ineptitudes. Their bargainers at_ the (University of Hawaii negotiated a contract
which cheerfully forfeited most of the traditional tenure system. When this was dis-
covered the enraged faculty rejected their union in favor of AAUP.

9.) The heavy NO REPRESENTATIVE vote on the first ballot shows that even if
PPU should win it would be representing a divided faculty. It is hard to see how it
could bargain effectively or expeditiously under such circumstances.

10.) In our previous bulletins we have presented and documented the principal
arguments against unionism at Pitt—-the lack of clear financial benefits, centraliza-
tion of power, insensitivity to faculty-student relations, erosion of quality and the A
development of corrosive adversarial relationships. An examination of the AFT
record suggests that these) problems which apply generally to university unions '
are a particularly serious threat of PPU should be our agent.

We ask that you consider carefully what benefits you can count on with PPU as
your exclusive agent which can make up_for the price which all of the faculty and
the university will probably pay. Remember, unionism will havelittle effect on the
administration except to further consolidate its power. Whatever benefits the fac-
ulty may. get from the new power which unionism offers on our side of the table
will be paid for primarily by the faculty and students. ‘ ‘

One last point: some may feel uncomfortable voting for‘NO REPRESENTATIVE»-
because they do not want to seem to lend their support to the Administration amﬁf
its policies. These persons need have no such fear. Fifty-one plus per cent of the
Provost's area faculty voted for one or another of the three union groups in the
first election—a clear warning to the Administration that the faculty are not satis-
fied with the way University affairs arepresently conducted. In this context, a vote
for NO REPRESENTAT|VE‘is a vote for ref‘orm—through internal collegial mech-
anisms and without the AFT’s reliance on confrontation and the threat of strike.
The Administration has already been {given its warning: our task now is to keep our
options open by rejecting the AFT’s bid to represent us, and to work together
thereafter to make the University of Pittsburgh the fine environment for teaching
and learning that it is capable of becoming. ‘

A decision for a union is practically an irreversible step.

Undercover Reporler‘

 

"BY KEN GORMLEY

When was the last time‘ you
slipped a few white mice under a
friend's covers while he was

sleeping? Or tied all of your
roommates’s underwear into a
knot and mailed it to his

girlfriend? When was the last time
you pulled a prank on someone?

“Gosh," you might say. “I
haven't done any of that stuff since
sixth grade. You see, I'm a college
student now. I’m mature and
digniﬁed.”

Horsefeathers. 'You’re probably
the same goof-off you were in sixth
grade. The only difference is that

V i ,now you don’t do your gooﬁng-off
 Kn public for fear of what others

might think of you.

Take the time out to ask yourself
this question—“Has it been a
while since I've pulled a prank on a
friend or enemy?” If the answer is
“yes,” you should begin to wonder
if all that time and money you've
invested in college hasn’t been
wasted. ~

After all, college was invented so
students could learn to ‘do three
a little ‘studying, _a little
more romance and a lot of horsing
around. If one of the three is‘

?:§”lacking, your education is lacking,
 too.

“Good golly," you might worry
aloud. “I'm in real trouble. I'm
doing great in math and history,
but I'm getting an ‘F’ in

gooﬁng-off. How will  ever be a -

success in life?” _

Don’t despair. There’s still
hope. After a quick refresher
course, you should be a top-notch
prankster again. '

A SWITCH IN TIME

Many variationsof this classic
-trick are possible. But the basic
idea is always the same—get some
fool to believe it's a different time
than it actually is. The results are
guaranteed to be humorous.

Chas came back to the apartment
late after a hard night at the
computer center. He fell back into
his bed, exhausted, and yawned
sleepily. “Ahh,” he groaned, “at
least I can sleep in tomorrow.”
Little did he know...

Several hours later, at seven
thirty, my alarm went off. Icrept
out of bed, and tiptoed over to
where Chas lay snoring. He was
still asleep. .

My accomplice Joe, and I got
dressed hurriedly. While he set’
the table for “lunch,” I crept

" through the house and moved all -

the clocks forward three hours.
“Wake up, Chas," I yelled into .
his room. “Don’t you have an
eleven o'clock class?” Chas rolled
over and grunted.
“Let's go Chas. You're going to
be late." - I
He propped himself up on his
elbows, and stared atthe clock.
“Quarter to eleven? AArgh.”
Wearing the same crumpled
clothes he had slept in, Chas
staggered into the kitchen, where
Joe. and I were simulating an early

, ‘ _ lunch of peanut butter sandwiches

and soup. After staring at the clock
again, Chas gulped. down half 'a

place," he yawned, and dragged
himself out the door. Joe and I
ﬁxed the clocks and went back to
sleep.

An hour later, a rustling noise
woke me up. Chas was hunched
over my clock, trying to move it
ahead. “It won't work, Chas,” I
laughed. “By the way, how did
you ﬁnd out what time it really
was?”

“First I walked into a classroom
full of strange people,” he snarled.
“So I checked the clock, and it said
8:30. But I still wasn't sure—so I
looked out the window at the
sun...It was still coming up.”

WATER, PLEASE

“Four cokes and four glasses of
water, please.” Three friends and
myself sat nervously’ in a booth at
Sweet Williams, trying to look as
inconspicuous as possible. Each of
us clutched a square piece ' of
cardboard.

For some reason, the manager of
the ice cream parlor kept staring at
us. Could it be that he suspected...

Our Cokes were gone in a few
minutes. We began chewing on
our straws. . “I can't take it,”
someone gasped. ‘_‘I’m getting out
of here.”

“They know we're going to do
it," someone else whispered.
“Let’s' leave before we're arres-
ted.” A

Before I knew what was
happening, my traitorous friends
were heading for the door. I
grabbed my glass of water, held
the piece of cardboard over. the top,
and ﬂipped it over. After setting it
back on the table, I slid the
c_ardboard out. Voila! An upside
down glass of water.

We all hurried out of the store,
and looked back in the window just

in time to see an unsuspecting

waitress pick up the full glass.

Water splashed all over the table,

the ﬂoor and the waitress. ‘
Like grade-schoolers who had

just pulled a ﬁre alarm, we ran

down the street, howling ‘like
hyenas. Pranks don’t always work
the way you want them to work, but
they’re always fun. V

FOUND: ONE WALLET

It's easy to feel guilty about

pulling a prank on a friend, or even

on someone you don’t really know.

"But there’s one group of people you
‘never regret playing tricks on-

common thieves and scoundrels.

That's why I put this ad in the
Pitt News. “Found: Wallet
containing $187, in front of the
Wooden Keg on Friday.” Only a
common thief or scoundrel would
try to claim a wallet that we never
lost.

I was sleeping soundly, dream-
ing about beer and pizza, when the
phone rang. It was2 a.m. Rubbing
my eyes, I grabbedpthe receiver.’
There was a seductive voice"'on'the
other end. _ A

p“Hiii," the woman purred.’ “I

‘see you found a wallet with $187 in

it." ,
“Yep, I sure did,” Iﬁbbed.

“You didn't happen to ﬁnd
it...oh, about midnight or so on
Friday, did you?”

“That's exactly when I found
it," I said, ﬁghting back the
laughter.

“Ohhh. Thank you. Thank you
very much. You found my
wallet...and ‘I know just what
reward I can give you.”

What followed was shocking, to
say the least. The young lady
began to describe, in intimate
detail,- several unprintable acts

-' .w'l;ricl1.she would 'perform._for rnfez. as
,/,'; ml: .7“ 

 
 

   

a reward for returning the wallet. It
sounded like something straight
out of one of Swedish novels sold

‘ on Liberty Avenue.

“Listen," I said. “We’ll talk
about rewards later. Why don’t
you come over at 11 tomorrow and
claim your wallet. I'll give you my
address."

The woman gladly agreed, and I
gave her the address...for
Paul's Rectory. One bad turn
deserves another.

Besides, I ﬁgured when the
woman was directly confronted
with God, she would realize what a
scoundrel she was and mend her
‘evil ways.

At exactly 11, I ambled up past
the Rectory, so I could see her
reaction when she knocked on the
door and a priest answered. Just
then, a dirty old car chuggedmslowly
up the street, and stopped in front
of the priests’ house.

Gulp...there were two deadly
looking thugs in the car. They got
out, and stared long and hard at the
address on the’ building. I scurried
home, and hid in my room for a few
hours. ’ '

There’s one important thing to
learn about pranks. If they're not
executed properly, they may be
hazardous to one’s life.

FLOUR AND WATER ‘

Here's a trick that can’ be\

performed in three easy steps.

1. “Krackpot, good buddy. Can
-you come outside and look at our
broken railing? The real estate
company wants us to ﬁx it.” _

“Sure. Let’s go havea look at
it "

my cohort. In the meantime, I ﬁll a
paper bag with water, and open the
window).

2. “What do you think, Krack.
Can it be ﬁxed?”

“I think so.”‘

“Uh, while we're out here,
maybe we should see about the
railing on. the back porch, too."

“Good idea.” -

(The helpless Krackpot is led
toward his doom. I hang out of the
window and let loose the bulging
bag of water. SPLASSHH...It
explodes onto Krackpot’s noggin).

3. “What the...you jerk...”

Sean Kelly Lampoons Comics p 

BY TOM WASELESKI

.‘‘I hear there's a street in this

. town that's gonna get busted. You

all gonna go down and picket?
(Pause) No?"

Sean Kelly, an editor at the
National Lampoon, “The Humor
Magazine,” leaned over the stand
in front of a sparse crowd in the
Student Union's Lower Lounge’
yesterday. '.

“Uh, you want me to give a
lecture to a crowd that’s small
enough to break up into groups for

bridge, or ,would you rather ask me ’

some questions?” He was
noticeably ill at ease, unusual for a
funny guy. But what he said later
about comedians made sense.

“Most comedians are morbid,
sad, depressed people with no
sense of humor. If they weren't
miserable, why would they have to
tell so many jokes?”

Talking about a former Lampoon
humorist, Kelly said, “Michael
O’Donoghue isua comic genius and

Covered with white paste from
head to toe, he comes roaring into
the house, like an enraged human
cake-mix. As usual, I hide).

RE-LAX. HAVE SOME PUDDING

If you get squeamish at the
mention of the words “diarrhea”
or “laxative,” read no further.
Because this prank -involves both.

,Being a person who‘ likes to do
some cooking every now and then, I
decided to make a big chocolate
pudding. But while I was stirring

. (Krackpot is lured outside by .the hot liquid. six chocolate Ex-Lax

tablets (enough to (cure the
constipation problems of six grown

men) happened to fall into the pot.
Clumsy me!

 Before leaving for dinner at the

' cafeteria, I poured thepudding into

a bowl, and set it in the refrigerator
to cool. Believe it or not, when I
returned, there were large chunks
missing from the chocolate dessert.
Someone had ravaged my pudding.

It wasn’t long before I discovered
the culprit. Every hour or so, my
roommate Larue would trot down to
the refrigerator, and take a few
scoops of the fudge-ﬂavored mess.
By the end of the night, he had

too many rages and the publisher‘

ﬁred him. _

“Our intention is to make people
laugh. We have a small staff so the
publisher can make a lot of money;
the most that’s ever been around is
seven writer_s—editors. No one
really edits the magazine, as you
can tell. We all like comics, mon-
stersfrom outer space—the crazier
the better—and'we’re all afraid of

girls. ’ " Kelly was loosened up now, .

giving answers before the ques-
tions could be put to him.

“We think the magazine is the
opposite of pornography because
it’s impossible to laugh and be
horny at the same time. Ever been
making out with somebody and one
of you starts laughing? If
somebody gets hot reading our
Foto Funnies, he's a pervert.”

Kelly said Lampoon gets busted
a lot. “There's a weird kind of
censorship in the U.S.," he said.
“There’s no little ofﬁce where
some little guy sits, instead there's
the newsstands». Magazines live on

Larue went to bed, without even,
paying one visit to the toilet.

“New York’s best artists, best

to enhance its graphics.

“We also have artists who've

from the Harvard Lampoon at the

makes its payments in pennies.

Kelly said he’s married with kids
aged 12, 11, and 10. “I was a
Catholic and even have a certiﬁcate
from the Pope that says ‘well
done.’ ”

When asked if he lets his kids
read Lampoon, he said he doesn’t
make an issue of the magazine.

“Frankly, I think it’s weird for a
12-year-old to read Lampoon, just
as I think it’s weird for a
45-year-old to read it.”

The government must pay more
attention to legislation that exhibits
a concern for he environment,
National Audubon Society presi-
dent Elvis J. Stahr said'at Pitt
yesterday.

Government pays more attention
to the monied interest groups of
industry and commerce that are
always out for short-term proﬁts,
not long-term costs to the
environment, Stahr said at a
luncheon which was part of a
two-day symposium on “Environ-
mental Law and the Quality of
Life.”

In 1972 Stahr, a former Pitt vice
chancellor, worked on a joint
US-USSR United Nations confer-
ence on environmental protection.

He criticized yesterday the
governmental policy which restricts
charitable tax exemptions’ for
non-proﬁt public interest groups
that participate in “propaganda
and try to inﬂuence legislation.”
Stahr said the provision was never
speciﬁcally deﬁned and charity
exemption could be revoked
overnight, severely limiting their

v ﬁnancial base.

“Those acting in the public
interest are thus restricted,” Stahr
said. _

Stahr claimed the business and
trade interests could lobby and
deduct -the expenses of their
lobbying efforts. .

“The Public Disclosure lobbying
act ﬁts the Soviet scheme of things
better than the American,” "he
said.

Stahr’ said the solution to both

crises is still the conservation of
energy. ’ ’

Solar energy, which controls-
wind and tide currents, will play a
large role in future energy
production, according to Stahr.

“The most important factor in
saving the environment is in
educating people to improve the
life support system on this earth,”
Stahr said. . A

_He was optimistic about the
future of education and the
environmentalist viewpoint.

“Education can generate a4

Stahr said.

Stahr explained conservationists
are not “fanatics,” and instead
deﬁned them as people who are
concerned with the wise use of all
natural resources and abhor their
abuse.

BY LEE GUTKIND

In retrospect, it’s fair to say
that I might not have invited
,Herbert Gold to this, our fourth
I say
this with no ill will meant. To my
Gold is the most

accomplished and articulate writer. *

at least in relatively recent times.
(Saul Bellow did address Pitt

 f . English majors in an abbreviated
; ‘conference some 15 years ago).

Gold isthe author of more than a
half dozen novels, including The
Great American Jackpot, Fathers
and Salt, has- published volumes of

, short stories and essays, taught

writing at the University of
California, Stanford, Cornell and
Harvard, received numerous liter-
has had works
published in many ﬁne magazines,
and had his books widely translated
abroad.

So why not Herbert Gold at Pitt?
Because I am told by some faculty
members and students Gold’s
books aren't selling as well as they

« _.used to, that he is directing his

energies at problems that no longer
-concern us; that the man, very
“simply, is out of touch.

But I can’t buy it. For each time
I read Herbert Gold, he profoundly,

- tenderly,‘ touches me.

» He is not the kind of writer the
reader avidly seeks out; rather,
‘Gold’s voice, words, ideas, seem to
seek the reader out, teasing, then
possessing the reader's concentra-

- -tion. '

I ‘am thumbing through an
out-of-date Atlantic Monthly found
sleeping” under a heap of current
periodicals on my coffee table. I
catch the middle of an article on the
emigration of Soviet Jews.

“An old man and woman, stiffly
bundled, -stand close to each other
and wait for something more to
happen to them. A giant from
Bukara with a white heard, a fur
hat, trousers tucked into high fur
boots, kisses me; his beard is
scented with cologne. A few
women don’t know what to do; they
weep. Many children, nurslings, in
blankets. A grandmother clutches
my daughter’s arm and begins
‘I
lost my pension, my rights,
everything.’ Now everyone is

- . kissing and hugging,’ so.I touch a

married couples. The action is

presented in fast-paced episodes ’

where Robert. plays the third
member, the “company” in all
these person’.s confused and
tedious lives.

The time span is two years, from
Robert's 35th birthday in 1974,
until another birthday in 1976.

 Gold, After All, ls

the train window, and she dodges
away, frightened. She has huge
distracted, dark-circled eyes.«' I
reach out to pat her doll. I had
never seen a doll with red felt stars
for eyes. The child dodges my
hand with a pleading cry. I can’t
remember the Russian words for ‘I
won't take it from you,’ but her

-mother is apologizing for her

daughter’s behavior. She doesn't
mean to be rude. She was brought
up to be kulturnaya. Atjthe border
the police seized everything except
their clothes and this doll.”
Gold’s voice, although somewhat
shrill at-times, is unique, blending
reportorial objectivity with a
novelist’s subjectivity and sensiti-
vity. We are aware of his feelings,

‘but heholds them in check. He is

detached from what he is observ-
ing, yet is clearly sympathetic to
what he sees. We do not get a flat
journalistic account of what is
happening, nor a passionate,
emotional reaction. No, Gold
maintains his distance, reports the
reality, yet ﬁlters it through the
mind of a sensitive human being.

Rereading the preface of Gold’s
1967 best seller, Fathers, I come
across the passage printed below.
It is about Gold’s father, and the
old man's desire to still participate
in business and in life.
again and again. It makes me
think. About my own life, about
how far I am going to go, about my
options amd my spirit, my need not
to conserve my energy, but to
spend it in joyous and meaningful
pursuits that will fertilize my mind
and expand the bridges of my exis-
tence.

“He planned to ‘consummate the

-deal in Cleveland, and the next

one, and the next. At eighty, he
intended to pay.court to poverty
and riches both. He went out into

Cleveland in his new Buick in"

search of efforts and chances. He
had learned that pain and triumph
cannot last, but he could ride ‘with
them as long as he could still ride.
He watch his friends slow down,

retire or die, and he went to a fun-_

eral almost every week, and he
said: “Sometimes I get dizzy for a
second and I hold onto my desk.

Like a dizziness it get black. But‘

they never know. The person I’m
talking to, they think I’m thinking.
Maybe I am.” ~

In April of hiseightieth year, he
went on looking for the chance to
exercise all his spirit and a little
more. Otherwise a man is never
secure, and knows ‘nothing of
success and failure, and takes the
chance of knowing, or perhaps-too

. much. of._his own life.”

I read it"

During this period, Robert wanders
in and out of relationships with the
couples and girlfriends, questions
his feelings about marriage-which
everyone is encouraging him to
enter—sings “Alone is alone, not
alive,” and in the end does not
show up for his last surprise party
which ends the play.‘ I

TM's Creative Heights

BY MREA CSORBA AND
M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The soulful wails of Eric Kloss’
saxophone set the mood.

Kloss, accompanied by New
York keyboard player Barry Miles
seemed to be taking the audience
through ‘soul’ exercises, coaxing
them from the involvements of the
day into a relaxed absorption of
their diverse, soothing jazz. Play-
ing the simple, melodic ’60s college

‘ favorite—‘ ‘ Scarborough Fair, ’ ’-

the two swung into the calypso 7/4
beat “Latin Thing.” '
Sensing the audience getting
loose and ready, Kloss eased into
the hypnotic calm of “Deep Rest.”
They played intimately, bypassing
the harsh surface appeal of rock
musicians for a direct communica-
tion with our souls. “Goddess,
Gypsy, and Light” continued the

A Sensitive Jewish

Of course. the criticism of Gold I
have most often heard has to do not
as much with his own writing, as
with his subjects. Gold, I am told,
is still possessed by his Jewish-
ness, and his need for the discovery
of himself, not only as a person, an
American and a writer, but most

writer-jew.

Well, so what? I can’t see
anything so terribly wrong with
that. Most of us go through life
either searching for our identity or
avoiding finding it. Gold is
evidently still in pursuit.

I am 33 years old and have never
entirely stopped’ grappling with
that same problem. I have spent
my life avoiding Jews, and
attempting to do everything oppo-
site to what they do. I marry a
Presbyterian girl. (Because she’s
not Jewish?) and divorce her six
years later. I hook up with an
Italian girl. And dump her. (Because
she’s not Jewish?) Itake up with a
Jewish girl, ﬁnally for the ﬁrst
time, and I do not like her, at least I
initially think I-do not like her, and I
know I do not like her family, who
are sickening and Jewy and
possessed with money and Gucci
labels and Miami tans. And yet, I
am still with this girl. I ignore her
insensitivity, talk of restaurants,
preoccupation with the power of
parents and hang in, attempting to
help this nice Jewish girl, this
Jewish American princess...be-
cause I love her? Because she is
Jewish?

In many ways I respect Gold for‘
attempting to face problems from
which most “liberated” artistic
Jewish males ﬂee. His critics say,
“Yes, that's ﬁne, but he shouldn’t
be trying to find himself in print._
That is too personal, too subjective,
too. self-centered. ’ ’

But then, what is a writer and ’

when is his work if he or it isn't
personal, subjective and self-
centered? Are we saying that
Mailer, Oates, Fitzerald and Jong
haven't written intimately about
themselves in the guise of other
characters, about the things and
the people and the situations that
most concern them?

“But Gold is out-dated,” a
student told mehseveral years ago.
“I'm over my Jewish hang-ups!”

Or, is he pre-dated, I wonder? Is
Gold, in his middle years, ﬁnally
dealing with those hang-ups that
most Jewish men cannot or will not
ever admit?

In literary circles, Herbert Gold
is known as a controversial
character. He seems to. be-either.

E =.—‘,

.especially as a person-American-'_: think

middle ground. Some _say he is too
political. In an artistic sense, this
means back-stabbing, jealousy.

the consensus seems to be,
however, that Gold is disliked’? by
some simply because he has the
courage to verbalize what many
other writers are often afraid to

In his 1966 essay, “Topplingthe
Ivory Tower,” Gold says that most
American writers don’t know
enough about the world, “Don’t
know in their bones what an artist
needs to know.”

The writer’s responsibility, Gold
says, seems to narrow as his
success widens, as he thinks more
of success, family, career, his place
in a future biographical dictionary.
“He-the writer——.-makes his way
into an aristocratic isolation while,
outside his study, the world grinds
along without him. Society
indulgeshim; he ﬁnds irony and
pathos or mere rhetorical stimula-
tion in the continually desperate
history unrolling beyond his
window. ' Naturally, he is intelli-
gent enough to suspect the danger.
He frets. He signs manifestos. He
speaks at rallies for peace or for
integration. But these remedies
are mere dramatic gestures. They
do not ﬁnally give the organic
connection with society—the sense
of casual responsibility—that an

‘artist requires.”

These are fighting words,
despicable ideas to an American
writing community that, by and
large, think they have emerged
from the Hemingwayesque tradi-
tion of involvement, of living what
they write. But Gold doesn't stop
there.) He lashes out again. He
says that the most talented
American writers... have isolated
themselves in formal pursuits, in
abstract ideas, while the worst do
the work of the world. I

. “They? are "called the best
because of technique, language,
sensibility, and that modern gift for

A making marginal differentiations,

but it left to the mediocre inside
dopester novelists to inform us how
we really live in the world here
below.”

Gold’s knockout punch comes at
the end of the essay. He says that
real writers must have real
nine-to-ﬁve jobs, “must enter the
common society of labor, of trafﬁc
jams, committees, bosses, under-
lings, so that they may understand
human beings “struggling for and
against each other, doing the work

_ u ' _ at the‘ wprld.-’.'. . Fir.st.‘they.,must . j I I .

ence are a system, not an

times.”

As I sit in my own Ivory Tower in
my ofﬁce at the Cathedral of
Learning, choked by the stench of
burning Burger Chef’s wafting up
through the ventilators, Gold

‘ makes me think again. I don’t want

then again, Gold might say,

, shouldn’t the writer confront the

world on its terms,‘ rather than his
own?

I pause, shake my head, look out
across the lawn trying to discern
faces in the figures that appear in
the windows in Schenley Hall. I am

right now. I turn back to my

very popular because they are so

why Herbert Gold is not very
popular in some quarters. Because
he is willing to deal with difﬁculties

mellowness, transporting listeners
into cosmic consciousness. Peace-
ful, yet exciting, Miles’ piano
playing seemed to be speaking of
the underlying currents of life's
harmony over which Kloss’ sax-
ophone trilled with the smooth
ﬂexibility of a ﬂute.

Like a practised masseur, Kloss
unwound his listeners with each
progressive piece. At the close, the
audience felt released into a
different level of consciousness.

Why was Kloss baring his soul
and stripping ours into loose

.: 4-

flexibility at the impersonal Car-
negie Lecture Hall? Kloss does that
each time he plays, his sets
bordering on therapeutic sessions
for our sensibilities. But on this
occasion his playing was a prelude
to a panel discussion on
“Creativity and Consciousness,”
exploring the relationship between
creativity and heightened con-
sciousness. Sponsored by Pitt’s
chapter of the Students Interna-
tional'Meditation Society, a group
for Transcendental Meditation
»(TM), Kloss’ music was to be an

illustrative lead-in to a discussion 1

of what expanding consciousness
through through art or TM can do .
For the discussion, Kloss, who

,has a B.A. in philosophy, was

joined onstage by Cynthia Garrick,
teacher of TM for the Meditation
Society, and Mary Jane Kidd, a
painter and assistant professor or
art at Edinboro State College.

Artist Kidd deﬁned conscious-
ness as nothing mysterious. “Ev-
eryone has the basic ability to be
aware of life's experiences, but
maybe they haven’t developed
it to their full potential. Artists, by
their trade, choose added percep-
tion and create works so others can
plug in on their heightened
experience.

Kloss, a TM practitioner for
years, agreed. “Music takes the
player and his audience into a
whole new realm of experiencing.
But, with TM, I've been able to

   
 

develop my consciousness so that I
bring products to the audience of
even higher awareness.”

Garrick explains, “Practicing
TM frees your mind of stress that
blocks creativity. Living under
stress clouds perception like green
glasses hinder the wearer's aware-
ness of color.

Kloss views his music as a
coalescence of seemingly clashing
ingredients —to create a unitied
work of art.

“Music is like life, in that
respect, and...,” Kloss continues
with a plug for the ‘second most

important facet of his life (music is
his first), “practicing Transcenden-
tal Meditation can do the same for
your life. TM fuses the disjointed
parts of your life into beautiful,
harmonious music. Art and TM
expand the mind and allow the
realization of a person's full
potential. They each do it alone-
think what they do together!”

If Kloss’ earlier performance is
an example of what art with TM’s
backing can accomplish, no’ music
lover will be against it.

The musical—music and lyrics I

by Stephen Sondheim, book by

-George Furth—is a series of
confused and frantic episodes.
Perhaps this technique was used to

-represent the pace of the city, but
the effect on the audience is one of
bewilderment. The beginning and
ending are ambiguous, the char-
acters cardboard thin. The whole
would not, adhere without the
animation and ardent delivery of
the Camelot company.

There are several amusing
incidents involving -a karate fight
between husband and wife and
Robert, several seductions and a
stewardess girlfriend with nominal
intelligence who has to leave
Robert’s bed to ﬂy to Barcelona.

The use of strobe lights,

projections and a retractable bed i

are used to increase pace, provide
depth, and add interest, yet only

increase the level of diversity and?‘

confusion. And the “Tic Tack”
dance, where a sole dancer appears
in a short black neglige, is the
epitome of the sense of isolation of
audience to production. The
purposeof this episode is elusive.

The salvation of the piece is the
work by the company. Jerry
Communale, Jr. portrays a strong
and convincing central character.

Somehow. a freshman and
All-American don't sound right
together. Like a ﬂaming match and
a gallon of gasoline—some things
just don't mix.

But for Pantherette swimmer
Kathy Stetler, reaching the rarity
of freshman All-American status is
only a stepping stone to further
distinction in women's swimming.

Stetler became only the second
All-American in the history of the
women's sports program at Pitt by
finishing in the top 16 in two events’
at the Association for Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) swimming and diving
championships in Ft. Lauderdale
last week. ‘

“I feel really honored,” Stetler
said. ‘‘I didn't do as well as I
wanted to in Florida, but I think,

though, that it's great to be an_

97

All-American.

By finishing a strong ﬁfth in the
50-yard butterfly (26.35 seconds)
and 15th in the 50-yard freestyle,
Stetler qualiﬁed for the four-day

(Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)

Nationals beginning Thursday‘ in
Long Beach, California. Stetler also
just missed attaining All-American

best event.

Other Pantherettes performing
in the‘AIAW meet include Angie
Lopez, the only other previous
female All-American (two years) at
Pitt, who failed to repeat after a
20th showing in the 200—yard
breaststroke (2:3l.3) and a 22nd in
the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:l0.73). Jenny Brooker dove to ‘a
28th in the one-meter board and
the 400-yard freestyle relay, of
which Stetler is a part, came in
22nd.

Stetler will join teammate
Jennifer Price and men's swimmer
Jerry DeMuro for the AAU
showdown. She will compete in the
100-yard butterﬂy, the freestyle
events and the 400-yard medley
and freestyle relays. Besides the
same relays, Price will try her luck
at the 100-yard backstroke. De-
Muro will tackel the‘ grueling
1,650-yard freestyle. '

“We're all getting ready now,"
Stetler said. “Jerry is at the
NCAA’s now, but Jennifer and I
are still swimming to get ready. If
you make certain qualifying times
at this meet or several others,
you're permitted to go to the

. merits in the 100-yard freestyle

Olympic trials."

NBA subsidizing
Top Performers

 

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

You have to agree—pro basketball is taking things a little too far.

Not only will you cringe when Itell you some of the salaries the top
players “earn,” but wait till you hear how they go about getting such
lucrative contracts. ,

A story in Sunday's New York Times revealed that many top
National Basketball Association (NBA) stars have been and still are
subsidized by the league and individual clubs in an all-out effort to
retain the top performers and keep them from the rival American
Basketball Association (ABA).  .

According to documents on ﬁle with New York Federal District
Court, such superstars as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes and Rick
Barry have been paid by each team in the NBA for at least ﬁve seasons
beginning in 1968. p _

A pool into which each club in the NBA contributed approximately
$13,000 helped to pay Abdul-Jabbar’s salary though he played for one
team—th'e Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks paid $500,000 of
Abdul-Jabbar’s initial ﬁve-year ‘contract, while the other teams
contributed‘ another $300,000—their way of welcoming the
-seven-footer into the league.

At first, this may have seemed like a bad move. Why help an

opponent pay a player who is going to pour in 40 points every time he
sets foot on the court and help that team to a championship as
Abdul-‘Jabbar did in Milwaukee? But the- NBA club owners are
thinkers and a step ahead of everyone else. By joining together to buy
the services of the top collegiate prospects, the NBA owners are, in
turn, keeping them from signing with the rival ABA, who, though it
has not been formally stated, surely uses a technique similar to the"
NBA’s in acquiring players.
. In 1970, the ABA ﬁled a suit charging NBA with engaging in
monopolistic practices and trying to drive the new league out of
business. Though the ABA is indeed on the verge of extinction, with
weaker teams folding here and there, the antitrust action still "stands
and is scheduled for trial June 1. The ABA will use documents
establishing the fact the NBA is trying to rub out their league that came
rightifrom the desk of former NBA commissioner Walter Kennedy.

Like most court cases being heard in professional sports, this actipn
will drag on and on and, in the end, nothing will be resolved. Perhaps
a merger would be a solution to the basketball war, but past attempts
at such a utopia have proved fruitless. So, bidding for players will
continue, and salaries will skyrocket to heights far above
Abdul-Jabbar’s sky hooks. '

One document appearing in the Times revealed yearly salaries of the
“ten best” forwards in the NBA. On top of the list was Spencer
Haywood ($325,000), followed by John Havlicek ($250,000), Rick Barry
($237,500), Elvin Hayes ($202,000), Jim McMillian ($200,000), and so
on. Now; here's the point of it alI—name one of these players who
deserves to be paid more than the President of the United States. And
to top it off, all these guys do is complain about their lack of ﬁnancial
security. or the brevity of their careers, or their risk of injury.

Bull. According to the Times, Haywood, and I'm sure others have a
similar arrangement, will receive deferred compensation of $100,000
per year from January 1, 1979 to January 1, 1984, in addition to his
current salary. As to the short careers and inj_uries-—most players
don't just play basketball. Many are businessmen and many more
invest their money in a variety of interests.

Don't get me wrong—l'm not taking the side of the owners, who are

' : merely’ st‘uﬁing,their-pockets fuller by investing in players of superstar

the June Olympic trials in the
100-yard freestyle because of a
time recorded last year. Women's
swimming coach Kate Mathison
feels the sky is the limit for her
freshman sensation. ‘

“She's a really talented swim-
mer,” Mathison said. “She's got
the mental capacity and the
physical ability of a really great
swimmer. Mechnically, she's
probably one of the best freestylers
in the country.”

Stetler is like that gallon of
gasoline—drop in a flaming match
and there’ll be no stopping her.

Prony--50 and Proud  

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Clad only in his sweat-soaked
long underwear," hockey garters
and hose, Jean Pronovost stood
before a flock of reporters in the
Penguins’ locker room at the Civic
Arena Wednesday looking like a
million bucks.

Just as he displays his graceful

' movement on the ice, Pronovost

faced the writers with an equal
amount-of grace—as much as he
could muster after putting his
name _in the National Hockey
League record books.

- The 31-year-old right wing from
Shawinigan Falls, Quebec is not
your tall, lurking type of forward,
like Phil Esposito, nor is he a
powerful shooter like Bobby Hull;
but, at a compact 5-11, 180 pounds,
Pronovost does his job with hustle

and courage. Now he has joined _

Esposito and Hull in becoming only
the 14th player in NHL history to
score 50 or more goals in one
season.

Pronovost was not elated in the
dressing room, but looked proud
and seemed to tower above the

..reporters, many of whom were

much taller.

“I can't tell you I feel any
different," he said in his quiet
French-accented voice. “I just feel
proud of myself because I never
thought I was going to score that
many goals in the NHL.”

Going into Wednesday's 5-5 tie
with the Boston Bruins, Pronovost
said he wasn't nervous sitting on
number 49, but as game time
approached the tension began to
build.

‘—‘I was really nervous," he said.
“Maybeit showed out there, but I

TWO INDICATE INTENT

Coach Tim Grgurich and the Pitt
basketball program may have
captured two more outstanding
prospects for the*l976-77 season.

David Washington, a guard from
Detroit, has signed a letter of
intent, joining Michael Rice, from
Frederick, Maryland, as Grgurich's
top recruits signed so far.‘
Washington is a highly-recruited
junior college transfer. '

Also, Schenley star Nathan
(Sonny) Lewis reportedly told
Grgurich after Schenley's loss to
Farrell Wednesday in a PIAA

,playoff game he is_.ready_._to, sign'.:

was really nervous. I kept working
hard, but I didn't really feel that
good. Sometimes you feel better
than other nights. But I got it and
I'm glad. .

“I felt really relieved when I got
it. Everything came right back to
me and I felt really good.”

Pronovost was inobbed by his
teammates upon scoring the
milestone goal, repeating a scene
that took place earlier when Pierre
Larouche became the 17th player,
and the youngest ever, at age 20, to
score 100 points’ in a season. The
rest of the Penguins seemed as
happy as Pronovost when the
bubble ﬁnally burst.

“They were working hard—just
as much as ‘I was,” Pronovost said,

 

PIERRE LAROUCHE

“and they felt the pressure out
there too, because they wanted to
get it to me so badly. But they kept
working and we kept digging and
we came up with the 50th and came
out of the game with one point.”

are given the starting command by
"a, referee, who watches from

out of the square also earns you a
point.

But despite all the kicking and
punching, karate is not the
aggressive, competitive sport you
see Bruce Lee demonstrating in the
movies.

“Bruce Lee movies are pretty
much fantastic,” Bridgeman said.
‘‘It would be like sending a Jimmy
Cagney movie to Russia, telling
them, ‘here's what American life’s
really like.’ ”

The idea of karate being a sport
in which one tries to be Number
One is definitely not true. As a
matter of fact, preparing for
tournaments makes up only one
percent of all the Pitt Karate Club’s
practices. ,

Which is probably why, when a
tournament does come around (like
the Pitt Karate Tournament at 1
p.m. in the Field House), the club
doesn’t boast its plans for huge
success. They don’t have any
black-belts in their club, like other
karate clubs. 9 8

Pete Lividini and Bruce Sutton,
two white-belts, will probably make
the best showing for the hosts in
the tournament. But lack of high
karate expertise around tourna-
ment-time doesn’t bother the club.

“We just don’t emphasize
tournament sparring at all,”
claimed Bridgeman.

Judo is a different story. The Pitt
Judo Club will be sending ‘four
judoka (people who practice judo)
to Indianapolis for the National
Collegiate Championships April
2-4.

Tom Connolly, grand champion
at the Allegheny Mountain Pre-
Nationals for the AAU, will
compete in the men’s 176-pound
category, while Cindy Mrouke (110
pounds), Robin Chapman (130
pounds), and Jenny Schueler (120
pounds) will be ﬁghting it out in
their respective womens’ categor-
ies.

“Judo is an Olympic sport as old
as basketball, ” Connolly said. ‘‘It’s
geared to safety and concerns
falling techniques—unlike karate,
where the techniques are mostly ,
throws, chokes, punches and
holding techniques, like in wrest-
ling.”

Tournament judo, a year-round
sport, is performed on a square mat

preside over the match.

time, if players are tied in point

This year, the Pitt Judo Club has
one of the stronger teams around.
Head Coach, Le Van Vinh, himself a
fourth degree black belt and
champion at the Asian Games in
1969, has built from a mere judo
interest a powerful squad in
Connolly, Mruoka, Chapman,
Schueler, Walt Gadyeski (afresh-
man sensation) and Steve Mahan
(third place at Allegheny Mountain

Pre-National Tournament). There _

are now three black-belts in the
club, not to mention six brown-
belts, two green belts, and a
mixture of yellow-and white-belts.

But the sad story is funding; the

Judo Club gets no money for the
University, thus giving it, along
with the Karate Club, club status.

“West Virginia, Clarion, Slip-
pery Rock, Temple, Ohio State,
Yale—they all have varsity judo
teams,” commented Connolly.

“PRESIDENT’S MEN“ NOT FOR
CAMPAIGN

ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP)-
City Councilman Christopher Lind-
ley has gone to court to win the
right to show the movie “All the
President’s Men” to pay off his
campaign debts.

Lindley, a Democrat, said he had
planned to show the movie April 7
and has sold 390 tickets at $10 each
to pay $3,500 in debts left from his
successful election campaign last
fall.

Warner Bros., however, told him i

he could not show the movie, he
said, because it had an agreement
with actor Robert Redford not to
allow use of the movie for political
purposes.

SUPERJETS STILL MAKING
NOISE IN U.S.

WASHINGTON (AP)—The Sen-
ate yesterday refused to prohibit
the Concorde supersonic jet from
making scheduled ﬂights into all
U.S. airports.

By a 50-31 vote, the Senate
rejected an amendment that would
have added the Concorde ban to a
bill authorizing $4.7 billion over 10
years to fund airport development.

The Senate then considered an
amendment allowing the Depart-
ment of Transportation to take $800
million from the airport trust fund
to quiet existing jets that make
more noise than allowed by federal
regulations.

The Senate ban on the Concorde,
if it had passed, would have been
permanent, and would have ap-
plied to all U.S. airports. The
House already has passed legisla-
tion prohibiting the Concorde, but
the House bill will only ban the
plane for six months.

PRINCIPAL STAGES SIT-IN

NEW YORK (AP)—With the
support of parents, teachers and
striking students, a Long Island
principal is in the third day of a
sit-in at his own office to resist his
suspension by the Board of
Education for dismissing a teen-
aged girl whom he labeled a
chronic trouble maker.

‘‘I will not leave unless I’m
arrested by the police,” Howard
Hurwitz said Thursday. “I won’t
resist, but they’ll have to take me
out of here in handcuffs. It will be
highly visible.”

DEPARTMENTAL RELEVANCE  
AND QUALITY EDUCATION   
AN OPEN LETTER  

March 24, 1976

Dear Colleagues and Friends,

The current economic and political ‘crisis at the University is deepening with every day. The pat-
tern of actions already undertaken by the administration at a number of levels and those actions to come
have serious consequences for all faculty and students at Pitt. The direction and nature of the University
of Pittsburgh is beingaltered for the worse. Plans for a new round of tuition hikes, efforts to neutralize and"
prevent the faculty and graduate employee unionization drives, as well as the recent decisions to get rid of
a number of progressive anduntenured faculty members are clearly related. These recent developments
represent the most antagonistic responses of the administration to the budget crisis. It is my opinon that
only an aware and united faculty and student body can defend itself against the consequences of the cur-~
rent direction set by the administration at the University of Pittsburgh. ~

In this context I must bring to light further demonstration of the crisis at the University and its
negative effects on education and academic life. On March 12, 1976, the University fired me from my posi-
tion as an Assistant Professor of English. With one sudden act Dean Jerome Rosenberg reversed the English
Department decision to award me tenure and refused to renew my contract after it expires one year from _
today. I contend that this dismissal is calculated, unilateral, in violation of academic freedom and profes— i _ 
sional integrity,_vand without educational and professional basis. Because my situation cannot be separated
from each crisis previously mentioned, because my teaching, academic and professional work in the last six
years has been directed toward improving the quality of undergraduate and graduate education (a principle
of unity between all faculty and students), and because the particular type of work which I do within the
Department and with programs supported by the Department is at stake, I request your consideration of _
this matter and the support of all concerned faculty and students.

When I accepted an appointment at Pitt in September, 1970, the English Department Chairman
at the time and the faculty hiring team assured me that the criteria for promotion and tenure were estab-
lished by the Department, that the Department would not hire a faculty member whom they did not
expect to promote and tenure’, and that my progress toward tenure could be accomplished by a primary . ,
commitment to teaching and the development of programs. My decision to come to Pitt (rather than to '1
one of twelve other Universities where I had offers of appointment) was based on my commitment to teach
students with a background similar to my own, on the fact that the English Department at Pitt was a lead-
ing Department in -the nation in its educational policy and practice, as we||'as on the-clear evidence that the ‘
quality of» intellectual life at Pitt was high enough to sustain my academic and professional work. In 1971,
and again in 1972, the Department unanimouslyrdecided _and the Dean approved my reappointment with- ’ -
out qualification. Subsequently, the new Department Chairman assured me that there were no reasons why
tenure and reappointment would be denied in my case. Last month the Department thoroughly studied my
case which included extensive documentaion of excellence in teaching with corroboration bymany stud-
dents and faculty throughout the University aswell as from a number of other Universities. My case also -
included abundant demonstration of diverse contributions to undergraduate and graduate programs, univer-
sity and community services as well as proof of good and unique scholarship and intellectual ability. The _ V
Department decided by a vote of 19 to 3 "to strongly recommend” me for tenure and reappointment on i 1
the basis of my performance in those areas and on the basis of the prospects of my |ong—range professional / ‘
contributions to this institution. -

Since the Dean's decision 12 days ago to dismiss me in spite of all the testimony in my behalf,
no reasons have been provided for denying my tenure and totally rejecting the Department judgment in my
favor. But I have learned unofficially that a secret ad hoc committee has set up and met in secret session.on
my case. No one has revealed who they were, what their specific qualifications were for judging my teach’-
ing, service, and scholarship or for overriding the judgment of the English Department and those profession-
als in the nation who supported my case. Moreover; it is a complete mystery what weight the Dean gave to
the secret committee review relative to the Department decision and what evidence was actually evaluated
by the secret committee. An ad hoc committee responsible only to the Dean, in the view of many faculty
including myself, sabotages the ability of the faculty to evaluate openly and rationally educational and
academic work, sabotages faculty development and the quality of education at Pitt, and makes a sham and
an illusion of due process. —. 1'“;

In my view the Dean's exercise.of absolute authority in thesematters cannot be ‘significantly
changed for the better without unionization of our faculty. Only by voting for faculty unionization can
we reestablish national self-governance, professional and departmental determination of faculty develop-

’ ment, the importance of quality education through excellence in teaching, and meaningful due process.

I ‘request that all those who can support my case do so, and I urge my colleagues in the faculty to
support the Union in the coming election on March 30-31.
