Posvar, Pitt leaders lobby for 2’

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

The day after President Posvar returned
from state budgetary hearings in
Harrisburg, he summed up the university’s
situation for a meeting of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

“The cupboard is almost bare, but the
political opportunities for getting some
relief are there," he said yesterday, “We
will ﬁght and fight and work and work in
the next few months to raise the
appropriation.”

Posvar went to Harrisburg with several
university leaders, including Provost
Donald Henderson and Student
Government Board Presidentjulie Shepard,

hoping to sway the state legislature to
raise the low appropriation for Pitt
recommended by Governor Robert Casey
in early February. In anticipation of the
low recommendation, Posvar instituted a
hiring freeze on Feb. 1.

“This a tough budget year for
Pennsylvania because of low revenues,
but the 5.5-percent increase just isn’t
enough. That coupled with the restrictions
from the Tuition Challenge Grant present
a problem,” Posvar said.

Last year, Casey proposed giving state-
funded universities $100 per student for
holding tuition increases below $ 100. The
schools convinced the legislature to let
them raise tuition by four percent and still
earn the incentive money. This year they

are again rallying for a percentage-based
incentive rather than a ﬂat dollar amount
cutoff.

“The Tuition Challenge Grant is a
marvelous political device for attracting
popularity to the head of the government,
but it is very different for those of us who
are trying to run a university,” Posvar said.

Posvar is hoping that the legislature will
let Pitt raise tuition by 6 percent or $230.
He said that he has not yet considered the
possibility of foregoing the grant and raising
tuition regardless of the state’s cap.

“I am not going to speculate about a
negative scenario like that, because it
could be self-fulfilling. It is something that
we would only do as a last resort,” he said

Posvar also addressed some of the

ncreased state funding

grievances that members of the FAS
expressed shortly after he instituted the
hiring freeze.

“I’ve heard complaints that the university
is squandering its resources with projects
like U—PARC and the [Pittsburgh] Cancer
Institute. The fact is that these are self-
sufficient,” he said.

In response to reports that the FAS is
underfunded, Posvar promised that he
would allocate $500,000 for FAS academic-
support costs this year.

“This money will be put into the base to
be built upon and increased in subsequent
years,” he said. Henderson also supported
the allocation.

“We want to avoid being penny wise
and pound foolish,” Henderson said.

Campus of the Future“ on schedule

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

The Campus of the Future
computer-network program is
proceeding without a hitch,
according to university officials.

The program, which mainly
consists of the NOTICE library
information system and the
Integrated Student Information
System, is being partially paid for
by the $55. computer fee required
of all students last fall. This fee
will rise to $110 for the fall of
1990. A

“We’re pretty much on track. 0

There are no problems except
for the need to do a lot of work.
But I wouldn’t call that a
problem,” said program director
of the “ISIS system, Chuck Heins.

The essential function of the
ISIS system is to provide a listing

of information about all Pitt.

students. Out of the seven basic
functions of the system, four have
been implemented. These
include course inventory, course
scheduling, recruitment
administration, and student aid.
The housing and registration
programs will be implemented
next month, and student accounts
will be put into use in July, both
within the university's summer

and‘

1990 target-completion date.

Although the total cost of the
ISIS program will not be known
until the project is complete, Heins
said that the initial fee to buy all
of the software was between
$100,000 and $150,000;

Heins added that additional
costs come from Pitt’s need to
modify some of the software in
order to meet the specific needs
of the university. This modifying
cost is unavoidable, he said.

“Every university goes through
that [when they buy new
software],” Heins said.

Pitt bought the software from
an outside source rather than
creating its own software.

“For us to start from scratch
would be more costly than buying
it from someone else,” said Heins.
“Also, you can implement the
system faster because you don’t
have to re-invent the wheel. From
a coststandpoint, we’ve probably
done pretty well.” 0’

Heins said he believes that
people are adjusting well to ISIS,
which is essentially supposed to
make life easier for students and
advisers.

“Adjusting to something new
takes time. It will take time to
realize all of the full benefits of
this system. It may take months

or even a year.”

Some of the benefits of N the
new NOTICE system are already
being realized because its
implementation was planned in
two phases.

The university has spent less to
complete the first phase of the
NOTICE system than it was
initially budgeted, according to
Jo-Ann Michalak of the library-
automation office who is in charge

- of implementing the system.

“We spent $1 million, but
actually we were budgeted for
more than that —— $1.9 million,”
she said.

For the second stage of the
project, to be completed by June
of 1993, the university expects to
spend $2.1 million, Michalak said.

The NOTICE project began in
1986, and by April of 1987 parts
of it, including the setup and
entry of books on PITTCAT, a
computerized card catalog, were
being implemented on the
Oakland campus. Since then,
other parts of the system which
have been implemented include:

-Circulation —— which keeps
track of when a book is due, who
has it, when it was discharged,
and whether a book needs to be
recalled or reserved for students.

It's official...AEPi is now a chartered Pitt fraternitity

By Shelena Rauscher
Staff Writer

The coldness of the snowy
weather was a little more evident
to some Pitt students than it was
to others on Saturday night.

As the snow poured down, the
brothers of Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity and their dates, dressed
in tuxedos and gowns, stood
inside the doors of the William
Pitt Union waiting for a bus that
would take them to their

chartering event at the’Le Mont
Restaurant on Mt. Washington.

A

 

The bus was late and only took
them as far as Grandview Avenue
and Merrimac Street. At this point,
they were told to get out and
walk up the hill to the restaurant
because the road was blocked,
and the bus could not go any
farther.

The “walk up the hill” turned
out to be a walk up the hill, down
a hill and up yet another. Shouts
of “It was 60 degrees yesterday,”
“I hate Pittsburgh,” and “She was
smart, she wore ﬂats!” were lost
in the harsh wind.

Once inside, the cold walk was

forgotten. The guests enjoyed the
dinner although there were some
questions about the soup. It was
a clear broth that tasted similar to
chicken noodle soup without the
noodles. “Hey, is there anything
in your soup?” was the question
of the evening.

At approximately 11:45 p.m.
the main purpose of the event
was at hand. On this night, the
AEPi fraternity was to become an
official chapter.

Started at Pitt in 1970, the
fraternity disbanded in March of

  

Pitt students decided to reinstate
the fraternity. They formed a

colony of AEPi. Now, two and a 0

half years later, the colony has
finally received its charter.
According to Mark Shenkan,
one of the founding fathers of
AEPi at Pitt, a fraternity starts up
and is given an incubation period
of one and a half to two and a half
years. During this time it is
considered a colony. Then it
receives its charter and becomes
a chapter. “This event bridged
the gap between being a colony
and a chapter,” he said.

  

According to Shenkan, AEPi is
primarily ajewish fraternity. The
university welcoming address was
given by Barbara Burstin, Ph.D.,
professor of Jewish studies at
Pitt. Burstin stressed the
importance of maintainingjewish
beliefs despite the inﬂuences
within their environment.

“Instead of being challenged
from the outside, we are being
challenged from the inside. The
challenge is not that we can’t get
in, but that we can get in too far.
We are threatened with

HISTORY

Feb. 28, 1975

Many Pitt commuters
took their lunch bags
elsewhere after Oakland’s
Burger Chef restaurant
announced that it would
no longer allow students
to sit inside the restaurant
when eating lunches
brought from home.
However, the policy was
not clear as to whether or
not students could bring
in lunch bags and eat
Burger Chef food at the
same time.

Feb. 26 — A Pitt police officer
found a student in the chemistry
building washing out a laceration
with water. The laceration was
approximately one—half inch in
length and was located on the
upper palm of the student’s left
hand. The officer put 4x4 direct
pressure on the cut and inspected
it for embedded glass. The
student said that he was cleaning
out a beaker when it broke in his
hands. He was able to walk
unassisted to the patrol car and
denied having any nausea.

Feb. 26 — A Pitt student stated
that her three former roommates
have been harassing her when
they see her. The student said
that one of the former roommates
pushed her frompbehind while
the other two continuously called
her names.

Feb. 26 —— A Tower B resident
reported to police that she
received a phone call from a
man who identified himself as

The caller then asked her if she
would respond to some items
from a questionnaire. When she
agreed, the caller asked her what
kind of bra she likes, what her
favorite type of material is, what
kind of underwear she was
wearing, and what her hair color
was. Realizing that the call was a
prank, the student hung up. The
caller called back, and she hung
up again.

Feb. 26 — A Benedum Hall
faculty member set his calculator,
ﬂoppy disk and a manila folder
with class notes on a table in the
first-ﬂoor vending area. Upon
returning a few minutes later, the
professor noticed his belongings
had been stolen.

Feb. 26 —— A police officer was
dispatched to the physicians’
parking lot to tag a vehicle whose
owner had parked without
paying. The lot attendant said a
student had pulled in and had
been told to pay $2 to park. The

-attendant stated that he was

collecting money from three other
cars when he witnessed the
student walk away without
paying. The officer put a citation
on the car, and the attendant left
a note on it. The student later
called the police station and said
that she had paid the $2 but did
not receive a receipt. The student
said she would request a hearing
in a district court.

Feb. 26 — A Forbes Hall
resident reported that he believes
his Samsung Walkman radio and
cassette player to have been taken

that he thinks someone came
through the bathroom door, since
he said a credit card can be used
to open them.

Feb. 26-.-—A Bruce Hall resident
said that for the last six weeks,
harassing calls have been received
on all phones in his suite. The

calls are on campus and occur at .

fact that AEPi is a primarilyjewish
fraternity also made an impression
on Burstin. “That is what’s so
special -about this group here
tonight. You men are affirming
your identity and as such are
insuring for our future a Jewish
community throughout. AH of us
are enriched by your efforts.”

The chapter history was then

the way in which the fraternity
was developed and some of the
various escapades it has been

~ ? SPRING BREAK ?

There are presently outbreaks of Measles across
the U.S.A. It is therefore possible that you may be
exposed to measles while on Spring Break.

Measles is a very contagious disease, spread by
coughing and sneezing. The early symptoms
appear approximately 10 days after infection.
These symptoms are fever, cough, and eye
irritation or sensitivity. About 3 days later, the
rash begins to develop. It usually appears behind
the ears first, then progresses to the face and
body. ‘

The Center for Disease Control now
recommends all people, born after 1957, have two
measles vaccinations.

The Student Health Service strongly
recommends that you update your Measles
immunizations with your family physician
during this break period.

  Making democratic changes

Sunday’s Nicaraguan election ended in a landslide
victory by opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro, thus

his marking the end of the 10-year government of the very

left-of-center Nicaraguan Sandinistas, led by self-avowed
“Marxist-Leninist” Daniel Ortega. »
Over the past 10 years, the history of Nicaragua has
been a complex and amazing one. The Sandinistan
revolution in 1979 led to the overthrow of dictator
Anastasio Somoza ,— who murdered Mrs. Chamorro’s
husband in the ’70s —— and to the ascension to leadership
by the Sandinistas. For a true understanding of how the

United States has felt about the Sandinistan leadership,

one only need rehash a few names: Ollie, Poindexter,
Casey, McFarland, Reagan and Iran-Contra. But that is all
in the past, and Chamorro now runs the show.
Chamorro will face difficulty in consolidating power
and ensuring domestic stability. The militaryand nearly

every facet of Nicaraguan government and society, from d

the police to newspapers and TV stations, are run by
Sandinistas. Although Ortega has agreed to peacefully
recognize the elections, disgruntled Sandinistas took
their frustrations to the streets yesterday in brawls with
Chamorro supporters overthe election results.

Among the legacies left by the Sandinistan leadership
are .an inﬂation rate of almost 40,000 percent and a
compounded interest rate as high as 221,000 percent in
1989. According to a December 1988 poll by Managua’s
La Cronica, 49 percent of the Nicaraguans polled said

. they would leave the country if they could. In that same

year 300,000 Nicaraguans, that’s 10 percent of their
population, did just that. The CIA’s The World Fact Boole
1989 reported that the 1981 literacy rate in Nicaragua was
88 percent. Last year Rep. Thomas Dascell, D-Florida, re-
marked that 70-80 percent of N icaraguans were illiterate.

Many disagreeing factions argue whether the Nicara-
guan economic disasters are a result of the war with the
Contras, U.S. economic sanctions or merely the failure of
Sandinistan state economic policies, but one thing can be
agreed upon: Mrs. Chamorro will have her hands full.

But Chamorro should have an easier time than Ortega
restoring economic prosperity to the country for a
number of reasons. The U.S. has pledged to lift sanctions
and send aid. Contra leader Adolfo Calero has said that
the rebels —— now getting what they fought for — will stop
warring within the country. Her economic policies will
probably not be as centralized as Ortega’~s and should be
more efficient. And much of the massive exodus of
Nicaraguan refugees now residing in Florida, many of
whom were the intelligentsia of the country, are already
speaking of returning to Nicaragua.

Many more exciting times lie ahead for N icaragua. Let's
hope that there is a peaceful transition to power and that
this free election will mark the beginning of long-term
democracy in Nicaragua.

Pittsburgh sports fans will soon‘

have the opportunity to witness
some of the best volleyball in the
world firsthand. This Sunday at
Fitzgerald Field House the United
States women's national team
takes on the women's national
team from the Soviet Union.
The teams will play a best-out-
of-ﬁve exhibition set starting at 8
p.m. According to Pitt volleyball
coach Sue Woodstra, who is
helping to organize the event, the

set is only practice for the teams,
but the competitive drive among
the players will not be lost.

“They will play very hard. You
have to play physical every match
and get ﬁred up to play the top
teams in the world,” said
Woodstra.

Woodstra, who played on the
United States Olympic team in
the early '80s, rates the Russian
team as one of the top two or
three teams in the world. She said
they have a good mix of youth
and experience and have a lot of
power on their squad.

Freshmen are not supposed to handle the long,
tough grind of a college-basketball season. They
should wear down and not be a factor at the end of
the season. ,

Turia Ransom of the Lady Panthers physically
shows the wear and tear of a rugged Big East
season. She is just recovering from a broken left
index finger and is playing with a ﬂoating right knee
cap. On top of all that, she is trying to get over a
cold.

Her face shows the anguish of the long season
with every playunder the basket. She grimaces as
she jumps into the air and lirnps away from the lane
at the end of the play. Yet, lately she has played her
most consistent basketball all year.

“Turia [has] played inspired basketball,” said Pitt
Coach Kirk Bruce.

Ransom, a forward from St. Peter’s High School
in South River, N.J., earned Big East Rookie ofthe
Week honors the last two weeks in a row, the only
player to win the award in back—to-back weeks this
season. H

Ransom has scored 49 points and collected 21
rebounds in her last three games leading Pitt to wins

1 against Syracuse on Feb. 17, and against Villanova

on Monday and an almost-upset of 25th-ranked

"Connecticut this past Saturday.

“I had a decent week last week,” said Ransom
modestly.

Her play of late has created optimism in the eyes
of Lady Panther followers.

“She's our future here,” said Bruce.

“She's only a freshman now, and she's good, but
by the time Coach Bruce gets done with her, she's

, going to be an All-American,” added Pitt co—captain

Lorri Johnson, an All- American candidate herself.

last couple of years,” said

In her ﬁrst year, Ransom has become Pitt’s third-
leading scorer in conference games (9.9 points per
game) and is Pitt’s leading rebounder in conference
games with 7.4 a game.

If there were a statistic for assists on a rebound,
Ransom would surely lead the nation. Ransom’s
rebounding style resembles the way a jack—in- the-
box would rebound. She often jumps and slaps the
ball back in the air for someone else to "grab.

“Sometimes I jump, and I don’t have it,” she said.
“It's there, I see it. I try to time the jump, but if I'm
reaching for it, I might go over the back [of an
opponent] or I just don’t have it. So I slap it away

—to another area so maybe someone else on our

team can get it.” .
Ransom is fast earning a reputation as a late
bloomer. Her consistent play has come in the

second half of the season, and most of her points I

lately have come in the second half of the games.

“For some reason, it seems like it doesn’t come
to me until the second half,” she said. “I’m playing
defense andtrying to do everything I’m supposed
to, but the points aren’t coming until the second
half. Maybe I look for the ball more in the second
half than I do in the first half.”

Ransom said Pitt’s guards look for the other
forwards first and may not be looking for her early
in the game.

“Their first look is Connie [Hurt] and Lorri
Uohnson]. Maybe our guards warm up [more] to
kicking it up to the post in the second half.”

-Ransom, at 6 feet, is often inserted into a game
to help give Johnson a rest for her troubled knees.
In 1986 Johnson had reconstructive surgery on
both knees, which have since worn down, barely

, making it through the season. —
“She gives me a break,” said Johnson. “If Coach

Bruce works with her for three years, he will make I,

Young pitcher bopingfor more respect for bis baseball team

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Picture this: you were a pretty
good basketball player and a
good baseball player in high
school. Now you’re a freshman
at Pitt. You decide to give the
baseball team a shot

So you go down to Florida on
the team’s annual spring trip,
have a decent outing and when
the season starts, BANG!
Welcome to the starting pitching
rotation of Pitt Panther baseball.

As an 18-year-old in your first
season, you throw more innings
thananyone on the team. You
face some of the toughest teams
in the conference, such as
Georgetown, Seton Hall, etc. You

average.

wind up with an 8.17 earned-run

Sound like a rocky start?
Well, consider that you played .and I've gotten a sore arm from it,

for a team that went 6-25, and all
in all, you didn't have such a bad
rookie season.

Meet Fred Iriti. A sophomore
who is more than likely to hold
his status as a starting pitcher this
season.

And that success is based on an
astounding total of basically two
pitches.

“I throw an overhand curve
and an overhand fastball. And I
do the same thing sidearm. Say
you’re a right-handed batter. I
throw a sidearm screwball that
breaks in on a right-handed batter
and a sidearm curve that would
go away from him.

“I’m not a big person. So I rely
on all my ‘junk’ to get me through,

too. I've been lifting hard so I can
try to develop a fastball in the
upper 80 [mph] range. But now,
by mixing up the angles, I can
keep batters off-balance," Iriti
said.

The baseball team has had a
very difficult time gaining
respectability around campus,
partly because it is a sport in the
shadow of football and
basketball, and partly because
the team hasn’t sported a winning
record since 1985. It has gone
38-85 since its last winning
season.

In his first season, Iriti felt the
stress of being on a team which
was one of the consistently worst
in the conference.

“I guess the word ‘fnistrating’

is there always. It was just tough
on all the players toward the end
of the season when we started
losing all the time. The attitude
went straight downhill. It was
one of the longest seasons {I've}
experienced since I was little,”
Iriti said.

The losing streaks created some
internal tension too, and in turn
caused the team to partially
collapse.

“If we'd lose a close game, the
pitchers would get down on the
batters. If we'd get blown out, the
batters would blame it on us [the
pitchers] and say that they
wouldn't even get a chance to hit
the ball.

“It seemed like it was an

hurdle events.

Sam Rice, who is the Big East
champ in the 55 and the 200, will
lead Pitt in the sprint events,
along with Brian Whitley and
Neil Malobicky.

“I’m going to try to qualify for
nationals in the 200, because
coach said the track is really fast;
one of the fastest in the East,” said
Rice. “Every single race from the
55 up to the -5000 will be tough in
this meet. There’s no slacking at
all.”

According to Vasvary, Pitt
senior Chappale Burton could
challenge for the top spot in the

400. Burton is also part of the
1600 relay.

Pitt also sends runners Chris
Nauman, Matt Colton, Scott
Humphrey, Jason Bodnar and
Keith Dowling. Dowling was third
in the Big East in the mile and the
3,000.

“[Dowlingl is at the top of his
game. Earlier he qualiﬁed
nationally in cross country, and
he could be a factor in the 3,000,"
said Vasvary.

High jumper Darrin Gillaspie,
who won the Big East with a
jump of 6-foot— 10.7S—inches, will
join shot—putter Dave Senay in

competing in the ﬁeld events.

Vasvary favors George Mason
University to win the meet. “They
have a great all-around team.
Unless they basically choke, they
are going to be hard to beat.”

Big East champ Georgetown,
Penn State and Dartmouth will
be the other top schools
competing. "

The rest of the pack is hard to
determine. “It’s like tournament
time in basketball. Whoever is
hot is going to do well. But we
just have to take care of ourselves;
that's all we have control over,”
said Vasvary.

Pitt Ski Racing Team places sixth in Regionals

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt Ski Racing Team was
one of _the top four teams in the
Allegheny Conference to compete
in the Mid-Atlantic Regionals this
past weekend at Great Gorge, in
Vernon Valley, N.J.

Pitt competed against 12 other
teams from the Mid-Atlantic
region, which comprises teams
from New York to as far south as
schools which have ski teams.

“We had an inconsistent season.

We had a lot of racers falling, but
we had the talent to go. Our last
weekend at Seven Springs, we
had two second place team
ﬁnishes, so that locked the
. Regionals in for us, ” said Anthony
Carestia, Pitt’s number two racer.
The ﬁrst day of competition
was the giant slalom, and the
Allegheny Conference swept, as
Pitt came in ﬁrst. Carestia ﬁnished
ninth and Rob Alarcon ﬁnished
fourth out of 60 racers from the
region.
“It was a really strong day for

us," Carestia said.

Pitt’s top female racer, Karin
Helm, did not have such a good
day through no fault of her own.

Carestia explained. “Her ﬁrst
run, she placed twelfth. She could
have probably moved up from
there, but on the second run, she
got disqualiﬁed. The reason being
our number five racerjeff [Smith]
didn’t show up in time to gate-
keep.

“If he would have gotten there,
she could have left and gotten to
the top to take her run. Since he

The Regional competition has
strict rules when it comes to
procedures governing the actual
races. A gate keeper is a
representative from each school
who makes sure a racer executes
the course properly. In other
words, to make sure a racer
doesn't miss a gate or make an
illegal move. It is a job much akin

“All these people are there to
make sure everything goes the
way it’s supposed to," Carestia
said.

Aside from their problems, Pitt
wound up ﬁnishing sixth overall.

“The good thing was "we
ﬁnished ﬁrst the ﬁrst day and if
we had a normal day [Sunday]

that we did, we probably would

Iriti said.

One problem baseball at Pitt
faces in being a “minor” sport is
the fact that the percentage of
scholarship money funnelled into
it is comparatively low after all
the football and basketball
scholarships have been awarded.

According to head coach Bob
Lewis, the baseball team doles
out an average of ﬁve scholarships
per year. The basketball team is

during a season, and the football
team is allowed 25, according to
Pitt assistant athletic director Larry
Eldridge. «

“People don’t understand that
other teams have more
scholarships than us. We’re a
third sport at our school [behind
football and basketball], where
with the other teams, baseball is
a second sport,” Iriti said.

“In recruiting players, if you
can't give them money, they're
going to go somewhere else. And
the schools that have baseball as
a second sport and not a third

,will get the good players.” A

Georgetown, Seton Hall,

Providence, Connecticut, St.

John’s and Villanova all front

basketball as their main sport.
Syracuse has both football and
basketball, but does not have a
baseball team. Pitt and Boston
College are the only two schools

‘ in the Big East with all three

l

Division I sports programs in

their lineup.

Another obstacle in persuading

1 top talent to come to Pitt is the
’ location and condition of Pitt’s

ﬁeld, according to Iriti.

Anyone who has ever walked
to a Pitt basketball game knows
that it is quite a hike up to
 Fitzgerald Field House. The
' baseball field is located behind
l Trees Hall, an even further haul

E baseball diamond has an all-dirt
I infield and a relatively short
outfield, especially down the left-
field line. Iriti sees these features
 as serious obstacles to a talented
l player looking to invest his future
in a university with a baseball
program. S
“Another thing toward
someone a field where they are
going to be playing the next four
years of their life, and they see
where ours is located and what it
looks like, it’s a tough selling
item,” Iriti said.
“On a weekday game, there

V. 1 can be anywhere up to eight

people there. On the weekend, a

7 lot of parents will come. But you

seldom see more than four or five
students in a crowd. And it has a
lot to do with how far the field is
from campus,” he added.

As for this upcoming season,

 Iriti is looking forward to the

continued development of a
young team. Winning is a major
concern, of course, but
establishing some credibility at
Pitt and around the league is
higher on his priority list.
I “I wish we could gain some
l respectability and maybe win
l some games early and get some
3 people interested in the games.
l And maybe keep the enthusiasm
l up on the team,” Iriti said.
' “I don’t think there’s that much
: talent this early because the team
’ is so young. But they have a good
attitude, and maybe the attitude
will take us farther than the talent.
“It seems like every other school
we go to, the baseball team is
really looked at there. It seems
like it’s become a joke here.”
The hard facts:

“We do lose a lot of games by
a lot of runs, and I guess that’s
what stands out.”
