By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council
-agj held its second annual Valen-
. tine’s Day Dating Game last
night for any Pitt student/who
was lovesick, lonely, or just
‘wanted to get up in front of a
crowd and have some fun.

The Pitt version of the Dat-
ing Game was inspired by the
TV game show and organized
by Mike Damp, the PPC
, coffeehouse committee chair-
Operson. The master of ceremo-
nies and star of the show was
Frank Nicotero. -

After a few humorous com-
ments to warm up the crowd,
Nicotero introduced the first
group of lovely young
bachelorettes.

Bachelorette No. 1 was
freshman Tara Blackstone. She
included ”being nosy” as one
if-5-of_her favorite hobbies.

Bachelorette No. 2 was
senior Tabari Williams, who
listed men among her main in-
terests. '

The third bachelorette, Ta-
hira Turner, said that she was
competing in the Dating
Game ”just to have some
fun.” She added that if the
contestant chose her, she
would ”make it a night he'd
' never forget.” T A

Nicotero then introduced
Delano Hull, the lucky

 bachelor who would have the

tough choice of choosing be-
tween the three.

Hull proceeded to ask the
three bachelorettes a varitey of
well-thought-out questions.

”What part of a man do you
find most attractive?” he asked
Bachelorette No. 1.

”His butt,” Blackstone re-
plied. When she stumbled try-
ing to answer why she found
~men’s derrieres attractive,
Nicotero helped her out.

R!

be able to squeeze his ass,”
Nicotero said.

When asked what she ex-
pected on a date, Bachelorette
No. 2 said, ”Romance me in
a seductive way... all night
long.”

Nicotero said, ”Just go
is ahead and pick her right
now.”

Hull asked Bachelorette No.

VOLUME EIGHTY-THREE, lSSUE SEVENTY-NIPNIPEA

Duquesne stops the presses on the Duke .

By Lou Grieco

and Scot Ross
The Pitt News

Duquesne Duke attorney Joel
A. Klein believes that by closing
down the student-run newspaper,

A the Duquesne Student Govern-

ment Association ”is doing an ex-
cellent job of showing the whole
world, including the students of
Duquesne, what the real world is

. all about.

”There is only freedom of the
press for the guy that owns the
press,” Klein said yesterday in
response to the SCA’s Sunday
lockout of the Duke's offices.

SGA President Happy Meltzer
told the Pittsburgh Post—Cazette
that the paper was shut out of its
offices because of an indepen-
dent checking account, an adver-
tisement about contraceptive
counseling and a controversy sur-
rounding Rebecca Drumm’s re-
election as editor in chief.

The ad sparked controversy
reportedly because officials felt it
was against the teachings of both
the Catholic church and a Cathol-
ic college like Duquesne.

According to Klein, the ad is a
pretext. ”There is a nebulous
statement in the student hand-
book to the effect that you should
take into account the moral

values of the university. Nothing
spells out what those moral
values are.”

Klein said, ”We believe that
the student government didn't
want to have to go to the world
and explain that [it] shut a paper
down over a contraceptive ad. In-
stead, [it] came up with these
other two items that were old
news.

”These other situations have
been around for a long time, but
nothing was happening. No one
was shutting the paper down over
that. The timing is just such that
you really have to question if it
could be anything else.”

Klein said that at a meeting last
night between student govern-
ment officials and Duke editori-
al board members, the SGA
outlined its reasons for closing
the newspaperloffices.

He called the meeting a ”com-
plete farce,” noting that only Edi-
tor in Chief Drumm was allowed
to speak.-

Klein added that the board's
sole comment in reference to the
ad was a letter to Drumm stating
that they did not want the ad run.

According to Klein, Drumm
responded that she thought the
letter was merely the opinion of
the student government. ’’We’re
not owned by student govern-

ment; we're the student
newspaper,” she said.

”This is why the key issue is
freedom of the press,” Klein said.
”The student government unfor-
tunately shows its true hand
when it turns around ‘and says
‘We didn't want that ad, but you
went ahead and ran it anyway.’ ”

Metzler was unavailable for
comment.

Klein admitted that the students
who set up the checking acount
”probably' didn't read the IRS
code first,” and didn't file any in-
come tax returns on the money
in the account. However, that
was 12 to 15 years ago, and the
students who set up the account
have long since left the
university. A

”Now suddenly the university
is mightily concerned, so says stu-
dent government, about the
university’s tax-exempt status be-
cause of this one little account,”
Klein said. ”We’re talking about
an institution with a mutlimillion
dollar budget and an account that
has probably never exceeded
$2,500 on its best day.”

Addressing the accusations
against Drumm’s re—e|ection,
Klein said that he understands
that someone came forward and
alleged that the election was
”rigged.”

”The individual ran for the edi-
tor’s position and lost, stayed on

the staff for a period of time and

this fall was asked to leave the
staff because of some actions that

were alleged to have taken

place,” he said.
Klein said that the student did
not come forward with any

problems about the April 1988‘

elections until the end oflanuary
this year.

Metzler, Klein charges, has
made ”a very serious allegation
against Drumm concerning
fraud” and explained that he
would ”applaud her actions” if

she decided to seek litigation .

against Metzler’s accusations.

Questions have also been

raised over the role of the Du-
quesne administration in the
matter.

’’I don't know if [the SCA] is
doing [this] for the administration
or not,” Klein said. ’’I do know

that the student governmen’_t~*V

seems to have gotten an awful lot ~ —~

of documents that could have
only come from one place, and
that's the administration.

”The net result, no matter how
you look at it, would be a non-
independent press, which would
suit the university just fine.”

In response to criticism, Baker to sell holdings,

ROME (AP) — Secretary of
State James A. Baker Ill an-
nounced yesterday he will sell his
holdings in a New York bank and
all his other publicly traded stock,
a move prompted by questions
from President Bush's ethics chief
about potential conflicts of in-
terest.

Baker said the decision went
”well beyond” what was re-
quired by law or had been
recommended to him by govern-
ment lawyers.

Baker's decision, which a
spokesman said had been
reached Saturday but was an-
nounced only Tuesday, came as
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee sources said the panel had
asked Baker more than a week
ago for additional detailed infor-
mation about his holdings.

The controversy revolves
primarily around Baker's hold-
ings in Chemical New York
Corp., which has lent $4.5 billion
to Third World nations.

As Bush's chief adviser on for-
eign policy, Baker is certain to be
confronted by the nagging

problem of the indebted nations
and their staggering loans to
Western and other commercial
banks.

While heading the Treasury
Department under President Rea-
gan, Baker developed the so-
called Baker plan, which called
on Third World nations to make
good on their debts asrthey re-
structured their sagging econo-
mies. It called for new public and
private lending, and did not seek
to force the banks to forgive the
loans.

Gorbachev remains
committed to reform

MOSCOW (AP) —— President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged
from nearly a month out of the
public eye yesterday to tell the
nation the Soviet leadership still
has sharp differences over his re-
forms but remains committed to
them.

In a 17-minute speech to indus-
trial, construction and transport

workers that led the evening tel-
evision news, Gorbachev said his
perestroika program had solved
many problems in political, eco-

nomic and social life. But he said

perestroika itself had created
many problems.

Gorbachev, who is party gener-
al secretary as well as president,
has said before that the Kremlin

leadership doesn't always see
eye—to-eye. Yesterday, however,
he gave a more detailed explana-
tion of the discord over peres-
troika.

”Even we don't know every-
thing and are still figuring out
what's what. But. all the same,

from this exchange [of opinions], I

sometimes the sharpest of ex-
changes’— which as a matter of
fact are continuing — we crystal-
lized the conclusions which
make up the foundations of
perestroika.”

HARRISBURG (AP) —- The
House yesterday rejected a meas-
ure that would force car insur-
ance companies to provide

The bill, which needed 102 votes

Soviet woman asks a favor on a Moscow train

We passed by the hanging
lights again and the train quickly
raced back into darkness. I stared
at the black walls, waiting to
catch another glimpse of a differ-
ent metro station.

My friends, also American stu-
dents visiting Moscow, stood
along the aisle trying not to look
conspicuous. Jim, his hands
pushed into the pockets of his
faded jeans, tried to balance him-

coat was pulled up close to her
ears, framing her rugged face
creased with age and cold.

”Does she?” I asked, wonder-
ing if she was lying. We had been
approached by so'many traders
during our visit, I wondered if this
was all a ploy to get me to give
her something or trade money.

”Oh yes, yes. She live Chica-
go. You live at Chicago?” she
asked pointing at me and then
out toward the window.

”No. I live in Pennsylvania.”

”Pen...sil...vain...ya,” she
repeated slowly trying to memo-
rize the sounds.

”How did you,” I began point-
ing at her, ”learn English?”

”Aaah,” she said nodding, ”I
teach me. Six months... no, no,”
she paused and raised six fingers.
I nodded, she continued. ”Six
weeks. I teach me lessons from
book. Friend give book. I do
good, yes?”

”Oh yes, very good.” She
smiled. I began to talk to her,
amazed she could learn to speak
so well by teaching herself.

The woman told me that her
daughter had moved to Chicago
a year ago and married a doctor.
Her son also wanted to leave her
and go to the United States —

then she would be alone.

”My name is Dolores Martin,”
she suddenly said. A Russian
named Dolores Martin. I looked
skeptical. She pulled out a little
red notebook and pointed to her
name neatly printed in black ink.

”My name,” she said, pointing
to the words with pride.

My friends had now noticed
my encounter. Jim smiled as I
shrugged my shoulders and con-
tinued my conversation with
Dolores.

”I ask favor,” she said hesitant-
ly. I looked away from her. I
should have known better — it
was all a ploy to trade!

”Wi|l you call my daughter?

demanded. ”You call.”

Before I had a chance to refuse,
she quickly opened her little red

The man across from us was
staring at what she wrote. For all
I knew he could have been with
the secret police. We had been
warned about dealing with the
citizens. Jim had even had his
passport numbers taken down by
a guard after he was approached
by a trader. I didn't want to do
this favor —— I almost wished she
had wanted to trade.

The train slowed to its final stop

Jim shouted at me from the
other end of the cabin. We were
at the last station. I quickly stood
up.
’’You call?’’ she asked again.
Such a small thing — to her, at
least, it meant so much.

”Yes, yes. I will try,” I said,
wondering if I really would. I

bertl,” Turner said after first in-
haling helium.

”Do you like a small, fast
car or big, slow, luxurious
ones?” Hull asked
Bachelorette No. 2.

’’I like small, fast cars,” she
said. ’’I get the big, slow and
luxurious elsewhere.”

Hull then took a minute to
ponder which lucky lady
would be his date. With the
crowd helping, he chose
Bachelorette N0. 3.

Hull said that he chose her

because her answers were
different. ”Not only were her
answers spontaneous, they
had some substance to them,”
he said.

Turner said that she had no
idea why Hull chose her.

’’I don't know, I was talking
with helium!” she said.

Hull's and Turner's date in-
clude a $25 gift certificate for
dinner at Hemmingway’s and
movie passes for King's Court.
They both seemed satisfied
with Hull's choice and began
making plans for their big
night out immediately.

Under the law, an accused man or woman is ”innocent

our society that it has often been applied outside of the

If casual sex prevails, then birth control is a must

Among the issues culmininat-
ing in the recent actions of the
student government leaders at
Duquesne University was the ap-
pearance of an ad by Family Plan-
ning Services in The Duquesne
Duke. Although the Duke is a
publication produced by a Cath-
olic institution, the student

cgovernment’s reponse to the sub-

ject of birth control reflects the at-
titudes of our society as a whole.

AMY LIEBMAN

Sex, alluded to in almost every
aspect of our day to day living, is
a topic that is rarely discussed
directly. Sexual messages are
thrown at us from every direc-
tion. The soaps, the movies, the

oadvertisements — sex, sex, sex is

everywhere.

Somewhere along the line,
however, the idea of responsibil-
’ity coinciding with our sexual ac-

 

tivity has been hidden from the
casual observer who is subjected
to these sexual messages.

For example, contraceptive ad-
vertising is avoided by the major
TV networks. Or, can you im-
agine Tom° Cruise, the all-
American boy, postponing
lovemaking in a movie like Top
Gun while he ran to the drug
store to buy a condom?

The consequences of our soci-
ety's refusal to talk openly about
sex are drastic. According to a
spokesperson at Planned Parent-
hood, the United States has the
highest teen pregnancy rate in the
industrialized world, with four of
every 10 American teenagers be-
coming pregnant by the age of
19.

Is it that teenagers in other in-
dustrialized nations are less sex-
ually active? I don't think so. After
examining the attitudes of Euro-
pean countries, the answer is ob-

vious. In England, for instance,
condom advertisements frequent-
ly appear on TV. Sex education
and the responsibility for sexual
actions are stressed at an early
age.

Also, both access to birth con-
trol and the variety of contracep-
tives available are much greater
in Europe than in the the States.
Contraceptives like the Norplant,
the Depo-Provera, and RU 486
are not being sold in America.

Currently, only the Norplant, a
small contraceptive device im-
planted under the skin for a peri-
od of one to five years, is even
close to FDA approval.

The Depo-Provera, an injection
that prevents pregnancy for a six-
month period, will probably not
be sold in the United States in the
near future. -

RU 486 is a drug substitute for
surgical abortion which is not
only safer than surgical abortion,

OUNTERPOINT

Moderation is just realism

When George Bush was elect-
ed president in November, many
of those who did not vote for him
claimed that we were in for ”four
‘Hora years.” Republicans quick-
ly rejoiced, because the public
had decided to carry on the ”Rea-
gan Revolution.”

It made sense. After the eight
years of the Reagan presidency,
the No. 2 man of the administra-
tion had graduated to No. 1.

Now, many of the conserva-

’ tives are not happy with President

Bush. They feel that they were
ped by a moderate in right-
wing clothing. ‘

When he became the vice
president in 1980, Bush said that
he was ”not going to operate like
Mondale. I'm not going to leak
my differences with policies that
are unpopular. No one’s going to
catch me trying to cover my ass
that way.” '

For eight years, Bush went
along with the Reagan policies.
Now he has a few ideas of his
own. And in the opinion of this

registered Democrat, that is not
Quch a bad thing. '

I agree that there is a difference
in the governing styles of Bush
and his dimwitted predecessor.
But what people are calling a
difference between a conserva-
tive and a moderate is actually
the difference between an idealist
and a realist. Reagan and Bush
basically stand for the same
things, but Bush realizes the limi-
tations of what he can do.

§e Let's face it, the world has
changed since Ronald Reagan
first won the presidency. I am not
so sure there was ever a place for
Reagan's black-and-white view of
the world, but now is definitely
not the time for rigid ideology.

Sure, Reagan made promises to
the conservatives, and did his
best to keep them. There were tax
cuts, and increased military

spending. No one was going to

make Reagan bend. He was-a
‘true conservative — and he
racked up more debtvthan all

' presidentsfrom _Washington.-to' 1

 
 

Carter combined.

Now George Bush has inherit-
ed a wonderful deficit, the result
of Reaganomics. Unless he wants
to become the next Herbert
Hoover, he is going to have to
sacrifice some conservative ideol-
ogy in exchange for some care-
ful planning.

LOU GRIECO

In fact, the president was re-
cently quoted as saying, ’’If it
weren't for this deficit looming
over everything else, I'd feel like
a spring colt.” Maybe some peo-
ple prefer to have an unaware
president telling them what they
like to hear, regardless -of reality,
but I'll take the guy with his feet
on the ground.

Election strategy does not seem
to interest the Republican right.
Forget the Electoral College.
Forty-six percent of the voters
picked Michael Dukakis. Not ex-
actly a mandate for George Bush.

Obviously, a good part of the
country either wanted a change,
or did not like Bush. If he wants
to be re-elected in 1992, it would
be wise not to step on the toes of
the general population to please
the small minority of the hard-line
right.

Another consideration forgot-
ten by conservatives is Congress.
When Reagan was elected, he
had a majority in the Senate,
which was‘ crucial to his legisla-
tive power.

3 George Bush is not so for-
tunate. The Democrats now con-
trol both houses of Congress, ‘and
after the humiliation of the first
six years of Reagan's tenure, they
are not about to go easy on old
George.

Bush swore that he would not
raise taxes and repeatedly in-
ferred that his opponent would
do so immediately if elected. I
doubt that the Democrats have

forgotten this. He is going to have t

to swallow. his pride, and step

softly whenxdealing with ”_(_Ion-g.. 

gress. As Reagan proved, it is easy
to talk tough when your buddies
outnumber the enemy, but-things
change when the situation is
reversed.

However, conservatives-should -. ., ‘a

look on the bright side. They

. have finally gotten the. majority

on the Supreme Court, and there
is a good chance that Roe vs.
Wade will be overturned this
yean

It doesn't matter that Secretary
of Health and Human Services
Louis Sullivan may (does anyone
really know for sure?) be pro-
choice. In matters of the Supreme
Court, the conservatives are prob-
ably going to get most of what
they want, and this will last much
longer than Bush's term as presi-
dent will.

Why don't the conservatives
give Bush a break? (If ultra-
conservatism is so good for the
country, why didn't Jack Kemp
even win the Republican nomi-
nation, let alone the presidency?)
George Bush doesn't have the
flair for theatrics that King Ronald

the first did. This president is go- ‘

ing to be judged on his record,
and considering all that he has
going against him, one can't
blame him for bowing to the god
of pragmatism.

but also a possible remedy for in-
fertility.

However, the French govern-
ment has been bullied into refus-
ing shipment of this drug abroad,
in acquiescence to the desires of
pro-lifers.

In spite of the sexual innuendo
that our society is constantly
bombarded with, institutions like
Duquesne University refuse to
accept the fact that abstinence is
rarely practiced in today's world.

Why is America, a country
recognized as the most advanced
in the world, still being subject-
ed to the views and practices of
such a minority? One may argue
that the incident at Duquesne
resulted from the fact that it is a
Catholic university, and carrying
an ad that promotes contracep-

tive counseling is contradictory to

the teachings of the Vatican.
However, Catholic or not, it is a
respected institution of higher

education, and it is neglecting to
deal with the casual attitudes
toward sex and birth control with
which our nation is inundated.
Avoiding the issues of con-
traceptives and sexual responsi-
bility by "prohibiting ads for
organizations like Family Plan-
ning Services in the newspaper

medium, a potential source of

education, is not the solution to
the needs of our society.

Education and a drastic change
in our country's backward belief
that sex should only be talked
about in a whisper behind closed
doors are necessary to bring
America to the level of sophisti-
cation which we are already
reputed to have.

‘Amy Liebman is a columnist
for The Pitt News.

Responsible gun owners
have always resisted any laws
that would ban guns com-
pletely, saying that if guns
were outlawed, onlyoutlaws
would have guns. But the
shooting of 34 children and a

CAL
THOMAS

teacher in Stockton, CaIif., on
Jan. 17 (five of the children
died) and the wounding of
four students at Woodrow
Wilson High School in
Washington nine days later
demands that another look be
taken at this argument about
laws and guns and human
nature. ’

If banning guns is not possi-
ble, then what about at least
requiring a waiting period of
up to two weeks for those who
apply to purchase a gun?

Our nation is drowning in
sex and violence. Often the
two are related, as serial killer
Ted Bundy testified before his
execution. The next television
season will feature programs
of simulated violence which
some critics have dubbed
”slash TV.” Sick minds are in-
fluenced by this material to
perform violent acts. ‘

Some merchants are all too
eager to cash in on our nation-
al preoccupation with
violence.

In Fairfax County, Va., just
outside Washington, an F.W.
Woolworth store last week
had 15 Chinese-made, semi-
automatic AKS-7A62 riﬂes for
sale. The advertised price for
this ”gun of the_ month” was

of the AK-47 paramilitary riﬂe,
is similar to the one used in
the California shootings. It can
fire 600 rounds per minute
. and is designed for the sole

purpose of killing people.
. Why is Woolworth’s, a fami-
ly store, selling such weapons?
It is small consolation to the

$400. The weapon, a version .

Gunlaws needed 
in violent times

ton and Washington that the
rights of people to keep and
bear arms are being protected. .
The Federal Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco and Firearms es-
timates there are 500,000
military semiautomatics in the
Untied States. The agency says I

88,000 AK-473% and r-‘I02j000"'?i '

Uzis have been imported
since 1985. There are no
figures available on other
brands of automatic and semi-
automatic weapons.
California Gov. George
Dukemejian, a conservative
Republican who was elected
in 1982 as a foe of gun con-
trol, now says he supports a
law requiring a 15-day waiting
period to buy any firearm. ‘
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum I

I (D-Ohio) wants to ban further

manufacture and importation
of such weapons while sub-
jecting existing ones to regis-
tration and tight regulations on
transfer.

The waiting period seems ._ : -

most likely to win a consensus
from all political corners. It
would serve two purposes. If
the buyer is angryor dis-
turbed, a waiting period
would allow cool-off time. It ’
would also permit the appli-
cant for the gun to be
thoroughly checked against
police records. Patrick Purdy,
who shot the schoolchildren
in Stockton, lied about his
police record and mental -sta- f
bility on a gun application

form, but there was no waiting - ~

period and no one verified his

- answers.

‘Laws may not deter every- .
body, but they do deter some
people. If just a single incident

it won't hurt responsible gun
lovers to suffer a little incon.- W
venience. After all, the dead
and wounded students and
their families have suffered the
ultimate inconvenience.

THE PITT NEWS

Balanced play puts Redmen away, 87-77

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

The Pitt basketball team im-
proved their chances for an
NCAA tournament bid last night
by defeating St. John's 87-77 in
front of a sold out Fitzgerald Field
‘House.

Pitt is now 13-10 overall and
6-6 in the Big East. They are half
a game out of fourth place in the
conference, which would put
them in good position for the Big
East Tournament coming in
March.

Pitt was led by Brian Shorter I

and Jason Matthews who each
scored 22 points. Shorter also
ripped down a game high 13 re-
bounds and played the entire 40
minutes.

Jayson Williams led all scorers
with 30 points, 18 coming in the
second half. Many of Williams
points came as a result of inside
moves against the Pitt defense.

”They’re not an easy team to
beat,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.
”Jayson Williams, I think is the
most improved kid in the Big
East.”

Matthew's opened the scoring
for Pitt with a three-pointer. St.
John's kept it close for awhile, un-
til Shorter started to take control
inside, including three power
jams in the first nine minutes of

O the game. Pitt lead by as many as

ten points up until the 6:03 ‘mark.
”They tried to play behind me
on defense,” said Shorter. ”That
gave me the chance to flash for
the ball and be wide open.”
The scrappy St. John's team
came back at the end of the first
half and cut into Pitt's lead. Five
different Redmen scored in the
last five minutes of the half, in-

,’ cluding Malik Sealy’s driving lay-

'1

  

up at the buzzer, as_‘Pitt’s lead
diminished to one point, 40-39.

Pitt came out hot at the start of
the second half and quickly had
their lead back up to eleven
points on Matthews’ foul shots at
the 15:14 mark. Matthews was
tough the entire half scoring 17
points on 4-5 from the field and

a perfect 8-8 from the foul line.

Darelle Porter also had an ex-
cellent night, scoring 18 points,
11 in the second half. Porter was
4-4 from the foul line and was es-
pecially hot with his long—range
shotting.

”We usually play [Matthews]
for the jump shot,” said St. John's
Coach Lou Carnesseca, ”but, he
was going to the hoop tonight.
Porter, who we usually play for
the drive, had a hell of a night
from the outside.”

St. John's didn't let the Panthers
run away with game in the se-
cond half though. The Redmen
went on a 12-2 run and cut Pitt's
lead to one point again. Williams
scored six in the run. Terence
Mullin, younger brother of form-
er All-American Redman Chris
Mullin, added a trey.

Matthews scored seven of the
games next nine points and Pitt's
lead was back up to six.

”This was a tremendous win
for us,” said Matthews. ”We
were still kind of high after Ge-
orgetown, but we couldn't let
that interfere with St. John's. I
give a lot of credit to my team-
mates, they know when I'm hot
and they try extra—hard to get the
ball to me.” _

The game never got any closer
than that as Rod Brookin started
to get into the act. He scored nine
points in the last eight minutes of
the game to put the game out of
reach for St. John's. But, Brookin
also contributed with his extra ef-
fortsand his impressive hustle.
He -was often on the ground div-
ing after loose balls.

Pitt's next game is against Big
East rival Seton Hall at Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday. Pitt up-
set Seton Hall already this season
(82-79) on the Pirates’ home
coun.

”I think it's going to be a war,”
said Evans. ”They didn't play as
well as they're capable of. They
were on a early streak when they
were playing terrific basketball.
They got off track a little bit, but
they've been coming back the
last couple weeks.”

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Dave Gavitt, commissioner
of the Big East, walked up be-
hind Louie Carnesecca after
Pitt's 87-77 win over the St.
John's Redmen and gave the
coach a tap on the backside.

’’You’ve got chalk on your
pants, Lou. That's part of the
hazards of coaching.”

Carnesecca, looking like he
just walked away from an
eraser fight instead of a crucial
conference battle with the
Panthers, was in a fairly good
mood considering the loss was
his team's fifth in its past six
games.

”Thanks," he whispered in

ing an eye on the interview his
reserve forward Billy Singleton
was giving the press but mak-
ing no effort "to brush off his
brown polyesters.

Making a fashion statement
was surely the last thing on
Lou's ‘mind at that point.

At 13-9, the Redmen are in
danger of missing the NCAA
tournament for the first time in
7 years and only the second
time in the last 13 seasons.

”You know, looking down
the road you wonder where
the break is,” said Carnesecca.
”It’s gonna be really tough for
us [making the NCAA’s].

”There are four teams [in the
conference] that will go pret-

Now is the time for Jason Mat-
thews to shine. ‘

Maybe he took a cue from the
program (he was on the cover)
sold at last night's game against
St. John's (an 87-77 Panther vic-
tory). Maybe he felt it was his
turn. Maybe he is just getting into
the groove as the 1988-89 season
gets" into it's most important time.

Whatever it is, (not that he has
been a sore spot at any time in
the season) Pitt's sophomore
guard is starting to light up the
scoreboard with some big num-
bers. Against the Redmen last
night, Matthews scored 22 points
(six of ten from the field, two of
three from three-point range and
eight of eight from the foul line).

the last five Pitt games, Matthews
has scored 98 points.)

”I know what it is like to sit at
home and watch the NCAA tour-
nament on television,” Matthews
said. ’’I watched that all through
high school, I don't want to
watch it this year. We can't afford
any more losses the rest of the
season if we want to go to the
tournament. These last few
games I'm going to go all out and
try to help the team win as much
as I can.” . .

On a team of great athletes,
Matthews did something to show
that he fits right in.‘

At the 6:36 mark, Matthews

‘drove to the basket and was

fouled by Redman fon/vard Matt
Brust. He hit both free-throws.

 

     

’’Finally I was able to get just a"

Experience—the opportunity for

in the 1988-89 production ofjed
C. Scrolls’ epic, ”David and
Goliath.”

That's too easy, too’common-
place. Anytime a team pulls off a
string of upsets, regardless of the
sport, every sportswriter at the
scene typically employs the old
”With slingshot in hand, the un-
derdog blanks, coached by their
miracle worker so-and-so, brave-
ly picked up the nearest lucky
stone and projected it at the gi-
ant Goliath, knocking him to the
ground and out of the top lO.”

Reminds me of going to the
laundromat with my parents as a

youngster and, due to the lack of
available Sports /llustrateds or
Spiderman comic books, irritably
filing through those Bible Stories
books to kill time.

Then, David picked up the
nearest lucky stone and hurled it
at the monstrous Philistine with
his slingshot, knocking him to the
ground and killing him.

Mom, can I go for a ride in the
dryer? .

Or at least David and Co.
thought Goliath was dead. Sure,
the stone beaned him right be-
tween the eyes, much to the
5—foot-7, 142-pound David's sur-

prise. (He admitted later in an in-
terview with CNN that the shot
was actually intended for
another, much more sensitive
part of the Phi|istine’s body, go-
ing on an insider tip that ol’
Goliath wasn't wearing a desert-
combat supporter. David didn't
have the truest aim.)

Actually, the shot—to—the—noodle
only temporarily knocked
Goliath out. He did hit the
ground pretty hard, though, bang-
ing up his chin on a piece of
glass, which required nine
stitches, but he was far from
dead.

However, David and Co. didn't
stick around to find that out for
sure. They celebrated quickly,

then took off in a flash back to
their camp, acting on the premise
that the only thing worse than be-
ing on the bad side of a 7—foot-2
Philistine is being on the bad side
of an angry 7-2 Philistine.

The real credit to David's fa-
bled success, therefore, belongs
to his sharp ministers of
propaganda.

Thus, the future king of Israel
goes into history as the owner of
the world's greatest upset, while
Goliath gets the bum rap of be-
ing a wimp and goes into the
books as the Patron Saint of the
One—Punch Knockout.

But after a quick recovery,
Goliath ended up packing up his

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 15, 1989

By Ralph Bernstein

AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA The
Philadelphia Flyers fired coach
Mike Keenan last June and
replaced him with Paul Holm-
gren because they wanted a
kinder, gentler approach to the
players.

At the time, Keenan was the
winningest active NHL coach af-

Oter four seasons. The players said

they were happy to see him leave
and Holmgren replace him.
Flyers’ general manager Bob
Clarke said the team lacked emo-
tion, enthusiasm and the zest to
win under Keenan. The Flyers

went into the playoffs last year
from a third place finish in the di-
vision. They lost in the second
round of the divisional playoffs.

Clarke inferred that Keenan
was too tough and inflexible.
Holmgren related better to the
players because he had played
for the Flyers.

"He knows how players want
to be treated. To me he's a Flyer.
He's paid his dues," said Clarke
of his former roommate.

Holmgren, Clarke's hand-
picked motivator, isn't doing as
well as Keenan. Last year the
Flyers were 29-22-6 after 57
games. This year they're 27-2 7-3.

They're fourth in the Patrick Di-

vision, 10 points behind first
place Pittsburgh, but more nota-
bly, seven points ahead of New
Jersey for the final playoff spot in
the division.

They hadn't lost to Pittsburgh
at home in 15 years and did re-
cently. They hadn't lost a regular
season home game to Vancouver
since 1982, and did Sunday
night. Once invincible at home,
they've already lost 12 this
season.

They've lost three straight, four
of the last five at home. They're
8-15-3 against teams with a .500
record or better. Two of the last
three losses were to Toronto and
Vancouver.

Of course, he was a strong

The more modern-time Pan-

Broadway Joe mentioned some-
where in the Bible? (OK, well I
could see where the pantyhose
commercial would put him in
disfavor, but David wasn't always
Mr. Perfect either.)

But the greatest, most—stirring,
absolutely unpredictable and

Holmgren’s "Happy Talk”
philosophy is wearing thin for

also reports that Holmgren’s pa-

the Flyers’ inability to get a point
in three games with Vancouver.
After losses to Vancouver and
Toronto this past weekend,
Holmgren wondered if his team
simply underrated the opponents.

The Philadelphia team's
problem is scoring. On top of
that, top defenseman Mark Howe
is out with a sprained knee.

Putting more basketball games in
the Igloo is not a very good idea

It has recently been alluded
that the Pitt athletic administra-
tion may move more Panther
basketball games off campus to
the Civic Arena.

Income-wise, this is probably a
good idea. Pitt would make more
money at the larger Civic Arena
(which holds 16,798 for basket-
ball games) than it would at the
much smaller Fitzgerald Field
House (which seats 6,789 and is
the third—sma|lest of the nine Big
East arenas). A ticket revenue in-
crease is inevitable. It is obvious
that the more tickets one sells, the
more money one stands to make.

The problem is that the Civic
Arena sits the fans farther away
from the court and relegates the
students to the far corner and
directly behind the basket. The
nature of the college game is
characterized by the closeness of
the fans to the court. Home field
advantage really means
something.

‘When the college game is

er Dave Gavitt, who spoke to
reporters and Pitt's athletic ad-
ministration and coaches at the
William Pitt Union yesterday, de-
cides that the game ”has enough
magnitude that it should be
moved to an outside site, then I
will rule that.”

Gavitt then went on to say that
he has done that in the past and
if he is wrong that the league will
make up the money that the
university would lose in the deal.

wrong,” Gavitt said.

Yeah, so far.

Pitt is in a unique situation
here. There are certain games that
they would sell out with no
problem. Georgetown and Syra-
cuse are proven since the Pan-
thers have played both of those
teams at the Igloo the last two
years.

Games with Villanova and St.
John's would probably sell out;
beyond that, it is anybody’s
guess. Boston College, Connec-
ticut, Providence and Seton Hall
are not sure sellouts at Fitzgerald.

Up until this season, Duquesne
played at the Civic Arena. When
the Palumbo Center was finished,
the team moved there. One of the

reasons that they left is because

look towards him. That is the way
Matthews likes it.

”My teammates get a feel for
me,” Matthews said. ”They know
when I'm hot and when I'm hav-
ing a good offensive night. Then
they will try extra to set the extra
picks for me and Sean [Miller]
will try to get me into the offense.

"I don’t want to say I'm the ‘go
to guy’ because Brian has been
playing ex_cel|ent down low all
season‘ long. If they start closing
in on him, and if I'm open or hav-
ing a good night, then my team-

mates look for me. I have no.

problem with them looking for
me late in the game. That's how
I have always played the game.”
”He is an excellent player go-
ing to the hoop,” St. John's coach
Lou Carnesecca said. ”We didn't
expect him to do it that way, but

IO he really burned us.”

Matthews is starting to burn a
lot of people with his play and for

 

the panthers tolcompete, it is
something they need.

Arena

Continued from page 12
futurefor college basketball, then
the future may not hold much for

ghe fan.

Huge arenas turn the college
game into something like the
pros. The fans are cast to the out-
side. If fans are going to be stuck
so far away, they might as well
stay home and watch the game
on the television.

There is a better view and there
is less hassle. If Pitt wants a big-

ger basketball arena, why not dis-

‘Qand the new sports complex
being built behind Trees Hall and
build one of their own? i

This wouldn't alienate the fans,
students, or the players.

Gavitt also said that in this 10th
year of the Big East, there is a

push to ”not forget our roots.

”This league was put together
by schools mostly on the basis of
their basketball programs,” Gavitt
said.

Well, the roots of college
basketball are the small, close
arenas where the fans actually
mean something. That is the way
it should stay.

AIIegheny’s Moore becomes

a special high school wrestler

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

WEXFORD, Pa. — North Al-
legheny was the nation's top-
ranked ‘high school wrestling
team for more than a year, and
it's easy to see why: 37 victories,
one loss and one Ty.

Ty Moore, the top wrestler on

s-nnsylvania’s top-rated team,
literally does not know the mean-
ing of the word ”lose." Only a

‘junior but a.|réad)7"a7"»tWo-time "

PIAA champion, Moore has a
96-0 record in 2‘/2 seasons and
will be favored‘ to win his third
consecutive state title next month
in Hershev.

The Class AAA 98-pound
champion in 1987 and the
105-pound titlist last season,
Moore is 24-0 thisseason, most-.
ly at 112 pounds, and has barely
been tested ——- except in practice,
where he competes daily with
three other PIAA finalists.

Before he began his scholastic
career, there was a question of
just who Moore's coach would
be. He wrestled at Seneca Valley
Junior High, but his family made

‘a long-r‘umored*move into the’

nearby North Allegheny School
District before his freshman year,

"just in time for Moore to join

what already was one of the
state's premiere teams.

home games with Geor-

Pitt and St. John's are in
nearly identical situations.
Both teams have 13 wins and
they are seperated by only one

Pitt is now 6-6 in conference

progress. That's important for
this club,” Carnesecca
stressed.’

St. John's was outrebound—

great job on the boards. [Pitt
forward] Brian Shorter is so
strong inside. He was strong
the whole game.” said Sin-

”A few of those balls were
just off our fingertips,” winced

”We were hoping to get or
