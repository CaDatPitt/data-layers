_a 1,000-word 'deI7sgcri|ption of ‘they con-
ditions existing in the Adriatic ‘city’
after the place was put under block-
ade, and was cabled by. Thomas Mor-
gan, who._ some months ago [was
transferred from the Paris office to
Rome as’ an assistant to the veteran,
Salvatore Co-rtesi. - ’ ‘
Mr. Morgan's story 6 was not only

-the first truthful account of the sit-
uatipn which had all Italy and the '

Allies by the ears, but? it was a
masterpiece of color and animation.
He told of Fiume being “a.-blaze with
ﬁags'~’ and her streets “ﬁlled 6 with
marching soldiers” and- carried the
reader in his mind's eye over the
Adriatic to‘ one of the biggest storm
-centers of Europe. ,

A signiﬁcant para.g'I‘a1I1lh laconicallv
stated that “the correspondent ‘reach-
ed Fiume last‘ night from Trieste,
‘being buried in the coal in the tender
Of, a. locomotive for the last part of
the journey to avoid -guards, along
the way." I

Mr. Morgan kept himself buried in

Giordano until it reached Flume, al-
though almost suffocated. Only-once
or twice, owing tothe carbineers on
guard along the track, did he stick
his head out 6 -to peer into the dark-
ness.‘ In the distance he saw the out-
lines of several destroyers lying in
the harbor and then realized his
perilous journey was almost at an
end. One young soldier who“ was
on‘ the same train‘,-. and. who also
“eluded the armed guards, traveled
forty-three houns without sleeping or
eating. merely to get to Flume. T

A Reaching ‘his "destination Mr. Mor-
gan hastened to a hotel where,-_ at
2:30 o'clock‘ in the morning, he was
awakened from a sound‘ sleep by 6a.

_ture,, such as papers, ﬁbers, cottons, fabrics, mica,’

 Without doubt public speaking has
been -taught at the University through-

 out the last century, if not from the

-very beginning of the history of the
institution. But records are lacking
which would show who did it and how
it was done prior to the publication of

‘record of the debaters and orators of
earlier years. ‘ ~ ' ‘

his brother, John, preceding him by a

Kornhauser served as secretary of the
Debating Society, which was then very
effective, and later as presidént of the
Philomethean Spcietyand debated in
intramural as well as intercollegiate-
contests throughout his course. Wiese
was equally prominent‘, serving as‘ the
president of thepelbating Society and
‘for two years captaining successful
debate teams which.‘ demonstrated‘
their prowess in contests with other
Western , Pennsylvania ixﬁtitutions.
Ojconnor was also president of Phil-

of the Debaters’ Union, a short lived
organization, which succeeded-the De-
bating Society. c He was on’ two inter-
collegiate debating teams. At about
this" time debating achieved a stand-
ing which it had apparently lacked in
earlier years, and engaged the-.interest
of a very good percentage. of the
student ‘body, particularly the most
active undergraduates. / H .
George S. Coleman, brother, of Paul,
won the-oratorical prize in 1908, and
debatedsfor three years. He also was
president of the Literary -Society, as-
sociate editor -‘of The Courant, and
took‘ second honors ’ at graduation, fol-
lowing his‘ brother's‘ footsteps to Her-
vard and the Reformed Presbyterian
Seminary, and then to Iowa, where he
is pastor of a congregation" at Hop-
kintown, and a part time teacher in
Lenox College. George Meade Dough-
erty and Charles 1. Cooper -were of this
period, too, Doughepty debating for
two years and making the«intercolle-
giate debating team, and being elected
to the presidency of the Debaters’
Union. He was an active worker in
the Philoniethean Society, president of
the Y. M- C. ‘A, -and like the Cole-
mans, utilized his ‘ability as at public
speaker in the ministry, he be—in_.g 0a
member of the Methodist Episcopal
denomination, and having served in
!several pastorates near Pittsburgh.
Charles 1. Cooper was a.varsity de-
baterand president of the Debaters’
Union. Since graduation" _ he has
achieved distincti_on:in social service
work -in Pittsburgh and has recently
been engaged injrelief work in Poland»
as. the head of an important mission.
Prominent in the next group of
speakers were Ralph E. George, 712;
‘Robert H. Wettach, '13,“ and ‘Horace-

Vb.ro_ther of tRalp’l1, followed’ closelyvin
his footsteps, editing The Weekly and
serving on , the" Student Senate and

Glaser held this distinction no less
than three. times’, _‘and Porter was

of the University.’ Glaser and George

baters, Glaser having entered the

George has worked since the war as a

and since to advance interest in pub-

this period who are remembered as
speakers of unusual ability were C.
