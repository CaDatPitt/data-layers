UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Activities Fair Planned
By AWS, Men’s Council
For Sept. 29, 30 in SU

The Associated Women Students and the Men’s Coun-

. cil are jointly sponsoring the Student Activities Fair Sept.

29 to 30 in the S.U. Ballroom running from 9:30 a.m. to 5

p.m. both days, and from.7 to 9 p.m. Thursday, the Fair is

designed to introduce the student to over 40,of the activities
on campus in which he can take part. . (

— Charles Hollander and Marilyn Fix, co-chairmen, de-

scribe it as “an opportunity to call campus organizations to

' recruit members. More important,
it gives an opportunity for stu-
dents to join an activity and

» therefore ‘ get more out of their

Put  less idealized terms, the
Fair will consist of approximate.-
ly 40 booths, each manned by
several members of the organi-
zations open to University stu-
dents. Entertainment will be pro-
vided Thursday night by the

.Men's ,Glee Club.
The Fair's basio philosophy is
that with the wide variety of stu-

dent organizations, everyone,

should be able to ﬁnd something
to interest him, yet -- many stu-
dents go through their entire col-
lege career without participat-
ing in any extra-curricular event.

Part of the problem lies in
communication—the students are

' » frequently not aware of ‘the op-

1'

\

portunities that exist, and ‘the
campus organizations are ignor-
ant of the student's interests. The
result of this situation is under-
manned student activities, .and
an overpowering memory of bore-
dom on the part of the Universi-
ty's graduating students. \

The purpose of the Fair is to
make sure that every student has
the opportunity to ﬁnd an activ-
ity he enjoys. In the past the or-
ganizations exhibiting h.ave
ranged from the Ski Club to the
Young Republicans; from the Wil-
liam Pitt Debate Union to the
Hill Education Project. The stu-
dents manning these booths are
prepared with information about
their organizations, and to sit
down and talk with anyone who
, comes by.

For students who have no def-

- inite interest in mind, the Fair

committee has prepared a “scav-

Rushing .

  Reinstated

Fall rushing privileges have
been restored without penalty to
Pi Lambda Phi, Phi Epsilon Pi,
and Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities,
according to Parker Enwright, as-‘
sistant dean of men in charge of

fraternities. Speaking on the de-

cision to suspend the rushing
privileges of the three fraterni-
ties, Enwright said, “Action was
corrective rather than punitive.”

Enwright is sending formal let-
ters to the fraternities informing
them of the restoration of priv-
ileges, correcting the suspension
imposed for rushing violations
during the ﬁrst freshman orienta-
tion in June. '

“The administration has been
pleased with the fraternities’ help
in orientation,” Enwright added.
“Without their help it would have
a slim orientation program.” '

Poet Ciardi Discusses
Dante’s Divine Comedy

By ALAN DISLER
“Dante walked the Universe from end to end, spelunk-
ed down to Hell through purgatory and into Heaven and
all in a week,” stated John Ciardi to explain the title of
his Midday lecture, “The Longest ‘Walk in the Universe.”
The Saturday Review poetry editor spoke to a standing
room only audience in the Student Union lower lounge

Wednesday. Noted for his trans-
lations of Dante’s works, Ciardi
devoted his talk to a discussion
of The Divine Comedy of Dante.

In classifying The Divine Com-
edy as an epic poem, it differs
from standard epic form in that
the narrator himself is the central
character, and also that "it reads
like “a gossip column of what
happens in Florence.”

But an epic it is, because of
the scope of the subject matter,
said Ciardi. “Dante mapped the
Universe,” hesitated and for this

reason The Divine Comedy “re- ,

quires the total intellect” of the
reader.

In illuminating the magnitude
of Dante’s work, Ciardi related a
story of ‘a poet whose works were
rejected by Ciardi. The poet im-
plied that his verses were reject-
ed because they ‘were about God.

Berkowitz Complains

Frick Grant Limits Room Usage

Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associ-
ate professor of sociology, has
taken exception to Helen Clay
Frick’si ruling that only human-

. ities subjects be taught in the

Henry Clay Frick Arts Building.
Approximately 200 s t u d e n t s
are enrolled in Dr. Berkowitz’s
section of Sociology 81, which-
meets in 225 Langley Hall, hav-
ing only a 183 seating capacity.

Dr. Berkowitz, who seeks .a
larger room, does not feel that
room capacity should determine
the number of students in a class.
“I’m a teacher, and I will not
turn "away any students -who

 want to attend my classes,” he

 
  

said. , H ‘
In an effort to allow more stu-
dents

  

’ she. C 5-$32.1)?-"B-F"?-‘.°"Y7‘-“'.:--.,.

. contacted student records. He ex-

plained that Rosemary Kapp of

the Office of Student Records as-’

signed Sociology ‘ill to room 1.25
in the Fine Arts Building, which
seats 208.

Harry P: Whitehead, supervi-
sor of registering and scheduling,
later informed Dr. Berkowitz that
“this larger room, could not be
assigned to my course, because
Miss Frick,- who donated the
building to the University, would
not permit other humanities sub-
jects to be taught in the building.

-“He (Whitehead) also told me
that other students had been
turned away from the class ear-

her, because there was no more '

space "in the room,” Dr. ‘Reiko-
‘tyex aine-d._ ’

   
   

  

Miss lﬁa-rp acknowledge that
“the only classes that are sup-
posedly allowed in the 1=jiie__An's
Building are the humanities.”

“If Miss Frick has turned away
a German course, which is a part
of humanities, and a history
course, from the building: then
this is a discretionary power. I

would like to" know what dele-'

gated Miss Frick this ability to
essentially schedule the Univer.
sity’s classes in this building, be.
sides her, money,” Dr. Berkowitz
asked.

Assuming that the University
grants permission, Dr. Berkowitz
invites any interested student to
enroll in his course. ‘

Miss, Frick was not available

’for comment.,..'“ -"

Ciardi wrote back, informing the
p_oet that the reason was that he
wasn’t “worthy of the subject."
Dante was equal to this awesome
task, but at the same time Ciardi
felt “the reader shouldn’t be ap-
palled by The Divine Comedy.

It is Ciardi’s contention that a
careful reading of the ﬁrst three
cantos will provide an adequate
insight into the rest of the poem.

He said that “if ‘you follow that ’

path you cannot miss the rest
of the road.” But he also warned
that if “you read for 110 years
you’ll never get all 'of it.”

The opening scene of The Di-
vine Comedy takes place just be-
fore the dawn of Good Friday,
with a full moon, the sun in the
Vernal Equinox and also in the
zodiacal position, Aries, where

jointly ;conduct the search 1.
for a new University chan-

es, he can take a slip of paper
from a committee member which
has written on it a clue to one
of the booths at the Fair. After
he locates the booth, and perhaps

"stops to talk, he receives another

Pi Lam, Sammy} and Phi Ep are three of the most powerful fra-

Dean Parker Enwright seems to enjoy being contradictory. His re-
cent statements on "lifting probations on three social fraternities are
illogical considering the origin of the probations.
All three were suspended for reported rushing violatiohs during
summer orientation sessions. Yet, Enwright now says in lifting probations,
f‘The administration has been pleased with the fraternities’ help‘ in orien-

 If this is’ the rationale for lifting probations, why were they invoked
[in the first place. He seems to be saying since the fraternities were such
 big help_ the probations were merely for propriety. ‘ '1
- Enwright further states the probations were “corrective rather than
 p"nitive.” Yet, the fraternities suffered nothing,lnot even enough to create
bmbarrassment necessary for punishment. No rushing‘ privileges for this

to rush, they would be unable to perpetuate their chapters. Any hopes of

a fraternity row or increased fraternity strength would vanish. Enwright
was literally up against a wall. . _
Also, fraternities and other student organizations are faced by the

University’s ironic policy on orientation. People who belong to fraternities

are asked to help on the orientation and this year saved it according to
Enwright. Yet, they are not allowed to display any signs of their member-

ship and they cannot explain about their group unless asked. This applies

to anyone belonging to a student organization.

If the orientation is to orient then perhaps freshmen should be
allowed to see the reality of college life. Instead, freshmen and other stu-
dents must act unnaturally. ‘ —

Whether the fault lies totally or partially in the fraternity or orien-

tation system, Dean E‘nwright’s explanation was a tactical move which

proved a contradiction.

  
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
 

Student Attacks
Stern Coverage
‘'1 would like to say that I am
 singularly disgusted with the way
‘The Pitt News has been directing
what I would call an all-out con-
demnation of Student Govern-
rnent President Eric Stern._I call
jﬂthis condemnation “all-out” be-
‘cause I have seen opinions ex-
pressed not only in the editorials
but also in front-page “news ar-
ticles.” To start a news article
"fth the words . . . “It has be-
me increasingly apparent that
there is a void in the executive
direction of the Student Govern-
inent” . . . is not only to display
poor taste but also an appalling
ignorance of the rules of journal-
i5m_ . ' .
During the election, many dero-
atory references ‘to Mr. Stern
 published, and "it was obvi-
ous: that The Pitt News did not

support our present President.
Also, during the summer, many
snide comments were made con-
cerning his so-called “inactivity.”

majority of the student body, The

. students and not of a select group

on the editorial staff.

The editorial entitled “Shape'U,>
or Ship Out” (Sept. 13) spoke of
“petty-political games that were
played at the ﬁrst Student Gov-

ernment meeting.” It also con-~

tinued to say that ‘Mr. Stern
“must drop his personal greed
and juvenile desire for having
things only his way." If _ that

' statement isn’t petty, I ‘,don’t

know’ that is! Also, look at the
title of that editorial. It plainly
says, “Shape Up or Shipxout-"
To me, that embodies an objec-
tive that The Pitt News has been
harping on since last March, and
I wonder if it will stop until it

   Letters To The Editor

gets its own way.

I ﬁrmly believe that in an in-
stitution, such as the Student
Government there is no room for ,
pettiness, but I do believe that]
the President has the right to
favor one side.

In the long run, however, I
think it is high time for The Pitt
News to stop criticizing Student
Government. It is really ridicu-
lous to blame any one person for
an initial failure of the‘ Student
Government to live up to its
promises of securing a larger stu-
dent voice in administrative de-
cisions. We should remember that
the year has just begun. It is
time to begin anew,‘ to forget 0,1d
reputations and old accusations,
and to give Eric Stern the chance
to be a ’good Student Government
President. ‘~ '

\Letters To The Editor 

Student Explains
SG Proceedings

H Editor, The Pitt News:

On reading the ﬁrst paragraph
of your editorial (Pitt News Sept.
13), I was amazed to see that

C the editor of our student newspa-

paper had also been disgusted by I
the/Student Government meeting
of Sept. 9, 1965. I was, however,
disappointed by the remainder of
the editorial which /consisted of
"no more that outright character
assasination and a rather biased
interpretation of the superﬁcial
decorum of that meeting. You
were disgusted by the actions of
/some of the senators, while I was
apalled by the total lack of action

‘ on the part of the majority of the

senators.

There were several very impor-
tant issues raised at that meet-
ing: the issues of student respon-r
sibility, a redeﬁnition of the role
of Student Government, and the
willingness to exercise initiative.
Needless to say, these were the
issues raised by those you criti-
cized in your editorial. Their ac-
tive attempts to bring these is-
sues to the rest_ of the senate for
their serious "consideration were,
however, r e pe a t e d ly thwarted.

The remainder of the senate ‘

showed an obvious unwillingness

‘ to address themselves to these

matters. May I point out that it
was (these very matters which
were the topic of campaign prom-
ises and speeches. It now appears
that the majority of the senate
no longer has the courage neces-
sary to deal with them. '

Your editorial would have been

_ more worthwhile had you ad-.

dressed yourself to these matters
rather than a point by point

- code of bad manners. Not only is

the surface decorum insigniﬁcant,
but your description of the meet-

, ing contained many errors. I

would hope that these errors of
clariﬁcation were not deliberate.
Since you did not clarify many
of your statements I feel that

someone who was there should.‘

1. You speak of "President Stern
sitting smugly throughout the en-
tire meeting. You failed to men-
tion that as President he can do
nothing else but sit there. After
his opening speech (which you
also overlooked), there is nothing
more he can add to the meeting.
He can not propose any bills, nor
can he express opinions on the
issues on the ﬂoor, nor can he
call for order. With the above in
mind I would like to know what
you expect him to do?

2. You also show contempt for
the senators who left their seats
several times during the meeting
without asking for recognition.
Such action is a frequent occur-
ence in the United States Senate.

3. You also mentions that on
three occasions senators _ rose to
"comment on the.poor conduct of
their fellow senators. In each in-
stance those who spoke about the
lack‘ of courtesy were out of or-
der ‘in the words of Chairman
Hogan. They had, however, made
their comments so quickly that he
had not been able to rule them
out of order.

4. You speak of Chairman Ho-

gan spending most of his time _

making Parliamentary decisions.
You obviously do not realize that
as chairman this is the primary
function of his position.

I hope some of these correc-
tions will alter the many miscon-
ceptions that your editorial has
created.

that students will feel a closer
relationship with the rest of the
University community.. “I like
people to feel that they know
what’s going on,” said Miss Rush,
explaining that this closer rela-
tionship entails a “giving feel-
ing” from the students. ~

Miss Rush feels that this oppor-

tunity is a new one, because the

office of Vice-Chancellor, ‘pre-
viously held by Dr. Alan C. Rank-
in, had been divided into two
categories, Student Affairs and
General Affairs, which is now
held by Dr. Edison Montgomery.
This new concentration of duties
has given both jobs room for
improvement.

. Part of this “improvement,” ac-
cording to Miss Rush,‘ is the phy-
sical appearance of the office it-
self. By adding touches of color,
such as interesting wall orna-
ments, meaningful ﬁgurines on
the book shelves, and :"»:‘.~il€h8S
in the office, Miss Rush feels
the office will seem more invit-
ing and students will be able to
feel her hospitality. .

Miss Rush plans to have coffee
hours, inviting students from
various activities and academic
departments to sit and discuss
their common interests._ She has

decorated a lovely conference.

room for just this purpose, and
“can’t wait to get started.”
Miss Rush is working toward

an unusual end; the means to"

this end is up to the students.
She sums up her feelings in one

Rush Adds Personal  
Touches to New Office

Helen Pool Rush, Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs,
has given her new position a different outlook. “We don’t
need a formal introduction to get to knowgeach other,” she
began, ‘‘I don’t want those who don’t participate to think '
they can't come to see me.” The ﬁrst woman ever to hold
such a high i‘Un.iversity‘ position, Miss Rush has accepted
this as a “real opportunity” to maintain the closest possible
contact with University students.

Miss Rush has begun an “Open Door Policy,” hoping

Since it has been proven that

Dante’s intent to “start with a

to by his unique choice of setting.

Dante’s -cosmography was the

Therefore the further he goes in-
to Earth, the deeper into Hell
he goes.

Dante wastes no time in. his

His punishment consists of hav-

head grows back only to have it

‘The Panthers lack depth

this year, Oregon has 17 re-

turninglettermen, on paper
the ducks sound like the
Cleveland Browns, and Len
Cassanova’s squad beat. the
gridders last year with vir-
tually the same team, 22-13,
yet John Michelosen’s squad
is a one point favorite.

Joe the bookie may change
his mind by game time Sat-

.urday, but the most it will

change to is an even game.
The gamblers who can ﬁgu-re
the games with their own
magic systems are usually
accurate or they go back to
writing numbers.

For those with leanings
toward the regions of politi-
cal science a good reason for
the Panthers being favorites
could be sectionalism, or ,in
sports terms, just plain home
town advantage. Out of the

~ last 14 games coast teams

have played in the Stadium,
only one has been able to go
home happy. This is reason
enough ,to instill the local
heroes as favorites.

The Panther’s are without
Fred Mazurek, who couldn’t

move the team last year any-_
way, but the Webfeet are

‘minus Bob Berry holder of
all the passing records at

‘- Oregon. Berry _ gained 2,600

more yards passing than
Norm Van Brocklin did in

his career at Oregon. ,

Tom Travato will start for
the Ducks, however, Mike

A 'Brundag_e, an excellent pass-

er, will see action if Travato
can’t move the team. Ac-
cording to Hal Childs. .Ore-

gon Publicity man, the ‘Web-

——-

feet are a scrambling club
and play wide open Iootbali.
This means mistakes and the
Panther defense Wlll have to
be on the alert. A

Ray Palm will be the tar-
get for both quarterbacks.
“He has good hands and can
get into the. clear, and lacks
only great speed,” said
Childs.

The oddsmakers may also
change the point spread
when they ﬁnd out starting
fullback Barry McKnight 1S
a doubtful starter for tomor-~
row’s ‘contest. Mclimght had
his hand stepped on in prac-
tice and then went to the
hospital Wednesday because
the ‘wound became infected.

His loss will be great for
he Was the leading ground
gainer and has been -running
exceptionally well in practice

games. It’s hard to be opti-

mistic and the favorite when

the leading ground gainer is '

out of- the line-up. '

Childs also cited the fact
that some sophomores have
replaced veterans and the
depth Oregon has is solid of-
fensively and defensively. If
Childs would have been on
national television Tuesday,
Oregon may have gotten the
next pro franchise.

Even though on paper Ore-
gon has the Panthers out-
manned and their Coach Len
Cassanova is one of the best
in the country, the bookies
are hardly ever wrong and
the home ﬁeld is a big ad-
vantage. Anyway the Pan-
thers haven’t played a game
for_ nine "months and they
should be about due.

 

 

By GEORGE M. LIES ~

Frostburg State College
not only helps the soccer
team open the season tomor-
row at Kennard Field at 11
a. m.;. they will also help
coach Leo Bemis settle the
question of the goalie position.

“Much depends on Ed Zelnick, _

our starting goalie, since this will
be his ﬁrst experience under true
game conditions,” said Bemis. “He
still has a lot to learn, but he’s
coming and so far in the scrim-
mages, he has been tremendous.”

“In the game, if u our defense
gives him a lot of support and
he is lucky, besides making the

‘ good saves, he would build conﬁ-

dence in himself and may be
what the team needs to be a Win-
net.”

The defense Bemis speaks of
are the fullbacks who station
themselves in ‘front of the goal.
Captain James Cuddy plays the
left fullback spot, Cal Bonawitz,
the middle post, and Art Richard-
son,'the right side. If they play
a tight game, Zelnick will have
it easy. -

“Our fullbacks align along a
diagonal from a corner of the
goal to _the center of the ﬁeld,”
Bemis said. “In this manner, they
can force the dribbler to the side
of the ﬁeld where the shots are
harder.”

The ﬁrst game will be a cru-

cial one for Zelnick and the boot- Z
ers, but the ﬁrst game will not '

be the hardest.

Frostburg State’s coach Ken- I

neth Babcock brings with him a
rather green, inexperience team.
Besides ten seniors, he also lists
11 sophomores and one freshmen
on their roster.

Headed by senior inside for-
ward Johni Chaney, _Frostburg’s
lineup includes seniors Fred D.ay-
ton and James Seibert at the
other‘ forward positions. At tn
halfback spots, Babcock has at
his disposal /soph Russ Younker,
senior Clyde Broadwater, and
senior Blaine Griffith.

Despite Frostburg’s seemingly
untested hooters, Bemis doesn't
feel the opener is a breather. “We
thought we were ahead of them
since they haven’t started school
yet,” he said, “. . . but now I see
that they hpve had two-a-day
practices for a long time, besides,
those two Scrimmages.”

Bemis described Frostburg as
a scrambling type of soccer team.

DENNIS 
0regon’s Leading Scorer

  Injury Reduces Hopes

Of Victory in Opener

By TOM SACKS

  1"F'iillBack"Barry""McKrIight ‘ ‘is "the""'lateSt‘ “if” to" "pop“'up"  ’

in a series of question marks that have badgered the foot-
ball team ever since -pre-Season practice started several
weeks ago. This “if” is the biggest yet, with the Oregon
opener at the Stadium 1:30 p.m. tomorrow imposing its

‘shadow overhead.
—McKnight was spiked in the hand late in Tuesday's ,

practice. An infection caused complications -in his Wound

and also in the Panther situ~atiof1. His chances
' ‘are currently rated as slim.

Who will ﬁll in for last year's
leading ground gainer is a toss-
up. Senior ‘Qarmen Sporio’s ex-

perience has apparently given

him the edge over sophomore
Mike Raklewicz. The coaches
even put linebacker Jim Flanigan
through offensive drills the past
several days just in case.

“This sure puts a " dent in
things,” said offensive backﬁeld
coach Bimbo Cecconi.

Lack of depth had been pre-
dicted .as the gridders’ main prob-
lem all along. The current full-
back situation emphasizes the
plight. Earlier coach Joan Mich-
elosen had predicted, “without
injuries we can have a pretty
good season.” McKnight’s hand
has~rnade the head coach even
less talkative than is normal for
him.

Oregon is coming east with
one of its best teams in history.
Twenty-ﬁve of the Ducks are let-
tcrmen. Seventeen were starters

on last year’s 7-2-1 squad which

JIM FLANIGAN
Panther Veteran Linebacker
downed the Panthers 22-13 then.
In that game McKnight picked up
68 of his 551 total yardage last

year. i

“I never missed a game last
year,” said McKnight. “This is a
hen Of 3 W3)’ t9 be put out of a
game with just a little cut." The
“little cut” had required several

-parently. stepped on his hand and

A standout not returning from
Oregon’s 1964 team is All-Ameri-
ca quarterback Bob Berry. Re-
placing Berry will be Tom Tra-
vato. What Travato lacks in com-

‘ parison with Berry will be com-

pensated for by four Duck stars-—
linebackers Dave Tobey and Tim
Casey, end Ray Palm and guard
Mark Richards. '

Tobey, a, junior eligible draft-V

  
   

DAVE TOBEY
Duck All-American Linebacker
ed by the Pittsburgh Steelers,

and Casey are keys to 0regon’s
stunting defense. The Panthers

' have been working all week on

how to adapt to the defense
where the linebackers jump
around ﬁlling up the holes.

The gridders are hoping to
come up with a’ few surprises of
their own in the newly inno-
vated “I” formation, a Michelo-
sen first. “We're hoping to con-
fuse their defense a little with
the variations of plays that are
DOW DOSSible,” said Michelosen.
The coach isn’t sure, however,
just how long it will take Ore-
gon's eight’ of 11 defensive vet.
erans to analyze the plays.

Given the task tomorrow of
containing explosive Duck half-
back Dennis Keller .are defensive
ends Phil Dahar and Ed Assid_ -
Keller was Oregon's leading scorer
last year.

Quarterback Kenny Lucas will
be getting his big chance to prove
