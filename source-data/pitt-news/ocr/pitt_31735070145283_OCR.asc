‘Hope for an orderly meltdown’

Weather expert explains certain temperatures are required to prevent ﬂooding as snow melts.

The schools might be open, the roads
might be relatively clear and the sled
ridingmighthave ceased. However, the
effects of Snowpacalypse 2010 could
last all the way through spring, as the
snow begins to melt and experts worry

about ﬂooding.

“It all depends on how it melts,”
RichKane,warr1iI1gcoordir1ationme5
teorologist for the National Weather
Service, said. “We need to hope for an
orderly meltdown.”

Kane said that to avoid serious
ﬂooding, the weatherneedstoremain

ideal ifthe thermometer climbs ﬁve or

10 degrees above freezing during the
day to slowly melt some of the snow.
Then, the snow would stop melting
at night when the temperatures dip

“This would slowly release some
of the water into streams and creeks
during the day,” Kane said. ‘And each
night, [the snow] would lock back

up.

The timing of the snowstorm
doesn’t help, he said. Since itwas near
the end of winter, we have the possibil-
ity of a quick melt.

A trek of just less than4,500 miles —
from Poland to Pittsburgh— gave four
swimmers the chance of a lifetime: to

SGB testsNordy’s    
Place meeting space

Shall: ‘We decided to come down to you’, , 5

Carla Trinca- Conley
Staff Writer

Student Government Board met
in Nordy’s Place for the ﬁrst time
last night ——- with a few minor

-glitches.

At ﬁrst, it was difficult: to hear
members of the Board speak from
the back of the room. Fortunately,
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
found a microphone for the Board
to use, Shull said.

Students ﬁlled more than
40 chairs in front of the stage
where Board members sat at two
tables.

About 10 students were play-
ing pool, pingpong, watching the
Olympic bobsledding races and
eating when the meeting ﬁrst
began. After ﬁnishing their pool

game, some students stayed to V

observe the meeting for several
minutes.

SGB President Charlie Shull
said he “somewhat forced” stu-
dents into the meeting by bring-
ing it into the ground ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union.

- “I knew you weren’tcoming up
to the eighth ﬂoor,” Shull joked,
“so we decided to come down to
you.” '

Shull said he thought the
meeting went really well. There
were threeor four students who
stayed for about half an hour,
Shull said. .

“That’s half an hour more edu-
cation about Student Government
Board than they had before,” Shull
said. 5 .

The Board also announced its

website was . updated yesterday
with the members’ contact infor-
mation and information about
their office hours. It also updated

the information about commit- I

tee chairs, who were appointed
last week.

During the allocations portion
of the meeting, the Board ap-
proved $6,387.16 for the African
Student Organization. The group
plans to bring comedian Godfrey
to appear at its upcoming event.

The Board also approved Hil-
leljewish University Center with
$1,301.92. The group plans to

bring Alysa Stanton, America’s .

ﬁrst female African-American
rabbi, to appear at its upco_ming
event. P

The Board postponed an al-
locations request made by the
Black Dance Workshop for fur-
ther review. '

The group had hoped to re-
ceive funding for new costumes
for its upcoming dance produc-
tion totaling $3,400.20; '

The Board wanted to discuss
funding with the allocations com-
mittee and the group before mak-
ing 'a decision.

After the'Board addressed
all of this week’s allocations re-
quests, Shull announced that 56
students are currently scheduled
to attend Pitt Day in Harrisburg,

_during which students will visit

state legislators in an effort to get
more funding for the University.

Shull encouraged students to
“go lobby in Harrisburg for your
money.” He commended students
for their interest and involvement
in the issue.

University ’s_ College in High School program celebrates 30th anniversary

Becky Reiser

Next year, Anna Barry will graduate ~

from Pitt without ever having to take
a math class. Instead of fulﬁlling her
general education requirements atPitt,
Barrydecidedtogetajumpstartoncol—

— class inhigh school

- Pitt’s College in High School pro-
gram is celebrating its 30th anniver-
sarythis year, but many students don’t
know the office in Thackeray Hall ex-
ists. Instead of servingcollege students,
the oﬂice allows high school students

to challenge themselves by enrolling ,

in college—level courses while in high
school .
Barry, a junior at Pitt, decided to
take business calculus during her se-
nioryearofhighschoolto avoidtaking
a higher-level math class. She found
out that business calculus, or MATH
0120, gave her four credits that were
transferable to Pitt. _

‘.‘It covered my quantitative and al-
gébra requirements  so I neverhadto
take amath classt[at PitI],”Barrysaid.

- She said about 35 people were in
her class duringher senioryear ofhigh
school, and ﬁve sections of business
calculus were offered. It was Bethel
ParkHigh School’s only Collegeinl-Iigh
School course, so it wasvery popular;

, she said.

The Collegeinl-Iighschoolprogram
started in 1980 with one college level
course — calculus — offered at North
Hills High School in Pittsburgh. Now,
the program offers 14 courses at 116
different high schools across Western
Pennsylvania-and Ohio. Pitt has the
largest such program in the region,
although some higher education in-
stitutions — such as the Community

College of Allegheny Cqunty, Carlow
University and Chatham University——
offer related programs. .

College in  School, which dif-
fers fromthe nationalAdvanced Place-
menttests, allows high school students
to enroll inaclass oftheir choice while
they are seniors or juniors. The teach-
ers follow t:he same syllabus that Pitt

professors do, and they are required
to administerthedepanmental exams’. .

Although this might seem like a lot of
work for a high school student, there
areplenty ofbeneﬁts. '

Schools look for

student  

ufts University has been no
stranger to eccentric essay
questions for applicants.
While it usually sticks to standard
questions, one of this year’s op-

tional essays featured the question, ,

“Are we alone?” But in effort to get
to know prospective students even
better, Tufts now offers an even
quirkier application supplement:
a YouTube video. A
The guidelines for the video are
minimal. It’s to be 1 minute long

and say something about the can- A

didate, whether it highlights an

interest or hobby or just shares-

some of the student’s thoughts
with administrators.

At ﬁrst, this seems more like
some sort of odd project for a high
school AV class than an earnest
means of college application. But

.high school students, especially

those applying to bigger schools,
inevitably face feeling like little
more than a number lost in _the
swarms of applicants that admin-
istrators must sift through each
year. Tufts has an undergraduate
student body of around 5,000
students — not huge by today’s

-standards, but hardly justa large

high school. ‘
Sure, this method -of applying
is — as of now —— unorthodox, but
it should serve as an appropriate
means to do just what it intends:
help candidates distinguish them-
selves from the sea of other stu-
dents. Amid the range of submitted
videos, the clips have featured ev-
erything from card tricks, to sports
performances, to rap songs to one
student showing off his underwa-
ter video camera, according to The
New York Times; Day-in—the-life

‘image’

videos have also been popular. For

, particularly tech-savvy students,
’ it’s a chance for them to highlight

CI

their multimedia skills.,Yet as has
been shown," students can dem-
onstrate almost any skill that can
be ﬁlmed. '

It seems students are only
limited to the conﬁnes of either
their creativity or their ideas
when it comes to making such
videos. Some will be stumped for

ideas while others will embrace-

the chance to appear —— gasp! —
unique to an admissions board that
has looked at 15,000 applicants
this year, 1,000 of which ‘submit-
ted videos. —
Tufts stresses that the videos
are’ optional, and that not hav-
ing ‘one. can’t hurt a candidate’s
chances. Similarly, submitting a
vapid or otherwise disinterest-
ing video won’t hurtcandidates
either. The school also says it still
considersjan applicant’s essays in
full and doesn’t want to place any
less stress on the importance 0
writing ability. ’
Tufts has found that candidates
with possibly less money are still
making videos. Two-thirds of the
submitted videos came from those
also applying for ﬁnancial aid.
It’s impossible to project with

, real accuracy, but Tufts could be

setting a new trend. In the visual,
new—media age, the university
is offering students a chance to
use technology that’s becoming
increasingly ubiquitous and even
everyday. Video cameras and now
YouTube aren’t really cutting- edge

technology, so maybe it’s time to’

use these decidedly familiar tools
in an unfamiliar way.

Obama plan undemocratic

The executive version of health care expands government without consent.

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

Ending the Democrats’ legislative
dominance last month, Massachu-
setts voters elected Scott Brown, the
41st Republican senator of the 111th
Congress, and they simultaneously
killed Democratic hopes for statist
health care reform.

But like Lazarus from the grave,

Democratic health care reform re— *

appeared Monday as a new pro-
posal, drafted by the White House,
that combines elements of both the
Senate and House bills. Although
repackaged, the White House’s
proposal is simply a patchwork
imitation of the bills that were con-
sistently rejected by the American

people in elections and polls around A

the country. ,
Indeed, the latest data from
Newsweek shows that, as of Feb.

18-, only 40 percent of registered‘
'-voters support Barack Qbama’s

health care reform plan, whereas"

,49 percent oppose it. Furthermore,

an aggregation of polling data from,

Jan. 20 through Feb. 18 compiled
by RealClearPolitics.com — a non-
partisan, for-proﬁt polling aggre-
gator — shows that,'on average,
Americans oppose the President’s
plan by a margin of 14.3 percent.

Clearly, the Democrats’ dogged
pursuit of health care reform is not
about representing the will of the
American people but rather pursu-
ing a radically divergent conception
of rights and imposing this concep-
tion on our nation. a

The proof is in how Leftists —
both nationally and on our cam-
pus — dogmatically describe health
care as a human right. 'I‘radition—
ally, American rights are individual
rights to action or freedom from

government intrusion: the First ‘

Amendment’s right to free speech,

L the Second Amendment’s right to

bear arms, the Fourth Amendment’s

‘ right to privacy, etc.

However, while America’s found-
ing rights guarantee individuals the
freedom to say and do things free
from onerous government interven-
tion, the vision of rights enshrined
in Democratic health care reform
is a socialist construct that elevates

the government above the individu-

al and places it in charge of private
industry.

For instance, in a major expan-
sion of government power over the
individual, the president’s proposal
mandates that individuals purchase

_health insurance or pay a signiﬁ-

cant ﬁne. In a similar expansion of
government authority over private
corporations, Obama proposed that
the secretary of health and human
services be given new authority to
either approve or void insurance
premium increases.

The president’s proposal to ex-
pand government power is crafted
in a way to make opposition difﬁ-
cult. After all, it is almost impos-
sible to defend before the American

While these instances of expanded regu-

rights, by far its most threatening conclusion
is that health care is a right.

Unlike the First, Second or Fourth Amend-
ments mentioned above, the right to health
care is an imposition on other Americans be-
cause the health care has to come from some-
where. It is an assertion that Americans have
the right to another individual’s labor — in
this case the labor of doctors, nurses, hospital

administrators, etc. —— regardless of whether
or not they can pay for that service.

In this way, what is construed as one per-
son’s right is in actuality another individual’s
burden and notnecessarily just the burden of
Americans in the health care industry but the
burden“ of every taxpayer.

Indeed, as we debate this shift in rights in
this country from the rights of the individual
to act to the rights of the many to receive,
we would do well to consider the nation’s
founding and the opinions of its founders.
Thomas Jefferson, for instance,-described a

good government as one “which shall leave
men free to regulate their own pursuitsof
industry and improvement, and shall not

i take from the mouth of labor the bread it has

earned.” The fact that Obama’s proposal and
the reorientation of rights at its foundation

V When you hear the phrase
“rock star,” an attorney and film-

maker aren’t the typical occvupa-‘H A‘

tions that ‘come "ta "mind. d How-
ever,'Josh Moyer and Michael
Savisky crossed both sides of the
employment spectrum when they
formed their indie—folk band,
Colonizing the Cosmos, three
monthslago.

By day, Moyer‘ and Savisky,
respectively,work as a general

practice attorney,and a ﬁlmmak- -

er and writer. By night, Moyer
offers lead vocals and plays the
acoustic guitar for the band, and
Savisky playsacoustic electric‘
guitar and banjo. Inall, there are
six ‘members of the band.
“Practicing law is a very cre-
ative exercise,” Moyer said. “In

' that instance you have to be a

creative thinker on how to help

people solve problems, and you i

have that certain creativity ' in
creating music, except you’re not
necessarily solving problems.”
Moyer explained that the stark
differences in his vocational pas-

sions offer a sense of stability in.

Savisky. said that besides its
alternate sources of income, the
unique way in which the band was
created also sets Colonizing the
Cosmos apart from-other artists
in its genre.

“We all come from very differ-
ent places. I studied jazz guitar,

and Josh picked music up all on

his own,” Savisky said.

. Although the band was only

officially created three-months
ago, Moyer and Savisky have

played and exchanged music with _

each other for about 10 years.
“We started writing music

before we were a band,” Savisky
said. “Josh and I would send mu-
sic digitally through the Inter-
net, and he would write lyrics

’ for music that I would send him.

Or I would write music around
lyrics or a. melody that he would
send me,” he said. This exchange

“Josh and I have been playing

I together for‘ 10 years in various’

different forms and venues, so
it’s definitely more than a hobby.
But this venturewas something
we hadn’t really tried before,”
Savisky said. .

The name of the band was
born when Moyer_and Savisky
played a show together a few
years, ago in The Silk Elephant,
a restaurant in Squirrel Hill.

“Colonizing the Cosmos was a
name that Michael came up with.
He thought it would be cool to
name a song or a band after it.
He thought he could use it some-
where,” ‘Savisky said. A

the owner asked us to create a
poster. So we put Colonizing the
Cosmos on the poster,” he said.
The artist explained that co-
incidentally, the title ﬁt perfectly
with the dynamic of the young

“We didn’t do anything with it
for the next three or four years,
but when we started writing this

material, we noticed the first
couple of songs had this sort of
cosmic theme happening with
them,” he said.

Savisky explained that’s when
they decided on their band’s
name. He said the band’s name
served not only as inspiration for
their music, but also as an outlet
to reach out to their fans. ‘

From boys togirls: Keepit clean, classy

Sam talks to a guy who says that girls shouldn’t dress _to impress their male peers and that showering is a must. ‘

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

Kick off your heels, girls. It turns
out the blisters and sore arches
aren’t worth it after all — guys
aren’t going to like you any better
if you’re standing at a bar three
inches taller than ususal.
Curious’ to know what guys
actually want to see girls wear, I
sat down with my friend Sean Gal-
lagher and grilled him for his token
male perspective. I would like to
take this opportunity to defend
that he’s not an a**hole. He’s just,
well, a guy, and I appreciated his

candidness. .-

' Also, before anyone accuses
me of generalizing and stereotyp-
ing, let me preface: I realize I am
blithely ignoring the_homosexual
demographic as well as thoserate
males that do, in fact, understand
fashion and respect a girl who can
pull off drop waists and fur coats.

Let’s not‘ go on and on about
how there’s more to people than

just looks and it’s all dependent on

personal taste and blah, blah, blah.
All that stuff is for another day,

' and another column. Right now,

I’m strictly talking stereotypic
heterosexual lust. V
Guys “can’t tell the difference,

and it’s annoying to hear you com-
plain about your feet hurting. It’s
not worth it. Ever,” he said. So

a makeup isn’t pretty.

_ Sean Gallagher

“Things that take attention
away from your face are bad, but
maybe that’s because I’m easily dis-

. tracted. Dressing like you’re clearly

trying to impress someone, like
you want everyone to think you
have money, is no good,” Gallagher
said. '

.So constantly shopping for the
latest trends and spending hours
puttingtogether the perfect outﬁt
isn’t going to help ﬁnd you a boy-
friend? Well, not exactly.‘

“Girls really feel like we care
about their clothes. But as long as
they don’t look like Pippi Long-
stocking or they’re showing off
their lady lumps, we don’t notice,”

he said. Alrighty, then.

I As for beauty and hygiene, there _

aren’t a whole lot of surprises.
“I don’t want to know that

— there’s a lot: of makeup and you

look a fake color,” Gallagher said.
“Pounds of caked—on makeup isn’t
pretty. Shower before class — I
know when your hair is greasy.”
If you’re headed out to an eve-
ning soiree, it turns out wearing
the tightest, shortest dress you
can ﬁnd doesn’t mean you’re go-
ing home with someone. By night,
Gallagher recommends that girls

, should “look approachable. Wear

something ﬁtted, but not so tight

MOVIE REVIEW

Don’t get stranded on

this mediocre ‘Isand’

Courtesy Andrew Cooper

Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio play crazy. Or do they?

Noah Levinson.
Staffwriter,

“Shutter Island”

Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo,
Michelle Williams

Dir: Martin Scorcese

Paramount Pictures

Grade: B-

Watching “Shutter Island” is like eating
an amazing ﬁve-course meal, with a buttery
sirloin steak, an aged red wine and raspberry-
sprinkled cheesecake for dessert. But after
licking your lips and rubbing your full stom-
ach, you pull out a long, gray hair from the
bottom of your plate — and you’re a bru-
nette. ' I ,

That little hair at the end of a perfect eve-
ning can break a masterpiece,’ just as the ﬁnal
20 minutes of “Shutter Island” are unsatis-

factory, unfulﬁlling and ultimately damaging _

to the ﬁlm.

The ﬁlm follows Teddy Daniels (Leonardo
DiCaprio) as he investigates a missing persons
case in an insane asylum housed on Shutter
Island, a spooky and foggy series of cliffs and
woods in Boston Harbor.

There’s a big twist in Scorsese’s ﬁrst feature
ﬁlm since 2o08’s Rolling Stone documentary,
“Shine a Light.” It’s fairly apparent that the
twist is coming a little‘ less than halfway in, but
maybe I’ve just seen too many movies.-

The ﬁlm can go in two directions, and I
personally believe it took the wrong one.

Don’t be scared away, though. “Shutter
Island” is a beautiful, exciting ﬁlm. The cin-
ematography is reminiscent of Scorsese’s
work in introspective, soul—searching ﬁlms
like “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull.”

Shutter Island also completely solidi-
ﬁes DiCaprio as Scorsese’s new DeNiro. His
performance is troublingly addictive — it’s
impossible to get bored watching him.

Running at 138 minutes, the ﬁlm moves
surprisingly quickly —‘ except for its dragged-
out twist of an ending. There’s suspense,
there’s craziness, there’s weird sh*t going
on — “Shutter Island” plays out exactly as it

should for the majority of the ﬁlm.

Of course there are plenty of things in
the movie that are laughable, like the one-
note musical score that attempts to draw
suspense out of nothing, or the on-and-off

Boston accents of Daniels and his partner V

Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Even the dream (or
hallucination) sequences involving Daniels’
wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) scoot to the
verge of ridiculousness.

“Just don’t look at ‘Shutter Island’ too

closely,” people might say. That’s the problem,
though: For the whole ﬁlm you’re looking at
it so carefully trying to ﬁgure out every part
of the mystery — just like Daniels.

It’s such a shame, though. If only that 10-
minute—too-long, overly-apparent-through
out-the-whole—ﬁlm, self-defeating, purpose-
less, gray hair of an ending had never fallen
from Scorsese’s head, perhaps I’d be heading
back to the theater to watch “Shutter Island”
again tonight.

want to see it all before Fm ready to see it.
I mean, I_don’t walk around with my un-
derwear hanging out. It’s better to be more

_ conservative than _too loosy goosy.”

While trends are completely lost on the
average male specimen, his carnal desires
pay the most attention to how things look on
a woma_n’s body. “Don’t try to ﬁt into things
that clearly don’t ﬁt — know what works on
your body,” he said. , . '

By day, Gallagher suggests to wear some-
thing casual but not loose and baggy.

“You still want to look feminine, not like
a dude,” he said. -

Well, sorry to break this to you Gallagher,
but New York Magazine’s fashion blo g, The
Cut, reported this week in a post titled, “Go
Ahead and Get Fat Next Fall,” that baby doll
tent dresses are going to be all the rage next

season. So at least you won’t have to worry ‘

about seeing anything you’re not ready for.

‘ There’s a dichotomy between the fashion

industry -and sex. No one wearing a pair
of harem pants or shoulder pads is trying
to get catcalled by construction workers
anytime soon. Why is that, though?‘ Why
are the trends considered most fashion-

forward also completely repulsive to the

average heterosexual male? -
Is it a class thing? Is blatant sexuality
something of the lower class? God forbid a

'/1‘

high-end designer creates something that
looks like it could be marketed to a hooker.
Or is it because half of the industry elites
were weird and awkward when they were
growing up and never felt comfortable with
sexuality? ’ :~

Sure, sex sells. But when it comes to«fash-
ion, androgyny is a goal. After all, we’re talk-
ing about an industry that routinely sends
boyish, hormonally imbalanced models
down the runway, usually wearing something
that no guy would ever want his girlfriend
to wear;

I guess a girl has to decide which is more
important — dressing to attract or dressing
for self-satisfaction.

As for my own theory on what to wear to
draw attention? Well, I have a ﬁrm psycho-
logical belief that people are hard—wired to-
like those who care about their own hap-
piness ﬁrst. Wear what makes you feel like
a hot piece — whether that’s a slut-tastic
mini dress or an oversized sweatshirt. No
guy is going to enjoy perpetually answer-
ing, “You look ﬁne,” if you repeatedly try
to impress him and ask if something makes
you look fat. ' .

Listen to Gallagher, or don’t listen to
Gallagher. If it sounds like you’re wearing
exactly what he likes, however, let me know
— I’ll give you his number.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Harangody—less Irish up next for Pitt

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Gilbert Brown is one of four Panthers averaging more than 10 points a game.

Kyle Craig
Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team has endured a
rollercoaster of a Big East schedule, and the ﬁnal
stretch is approaching. The Panthers travel to
South Bend, Ind., to play Notre Dame tonightfor
the ﬁrst of the regular season’s lastfour contests.

It’s beenajoumeyforNo.12Pitt (21-6,1o—4), as
BigEastplaybeganwithaﬁve-gamewinnings_11'eak
followedbylosingfourout of‘ its nextﬁve. Nowthe
Panthers are on another ﬁve-game tear.

. The Panthersare rankedthirdinthe BigEast
standings, one game behind Villanova and two
games behind Syracuse. With all four of Pitt's
ﬁnal opponents (Notre Dame, St. John’s, Provi-
dence and Rutgers) sporting losing conference
records, a regular-season conference title is not
out of reach. «

WhilethePanthersareeyeingaregularseaso
title andadouble-byeinthe BigEasttournament,
the1rishai'et:iyingtoclawtheirwayintotheNCAA
postseason. With four games to play, a victory
against Pitt would help bolster the Tournament
resume of Notre Dame (17-10, 6-8).

Ifthe Irishpullolfanupsetitwillhavetobe
withoutthe assistance ofAll-American Luke Har-
angody.The South Bend'Ii'ibune reportedMonday
that Harangody will miss his third straight game
because of a right lmee 

Without Harangody, Notre Dame has lost to
St._]ohn’s and Louisvillebyacombinedthree-point
margin. Harangody averages 24.1 points and 10
rebounds per game. Hispresence could havebeen
the difference between the NCAA Tournament
and the NI'I‘.

With their senior star sidelined, the Irish will

threat. The 6—foot-8 _Abromait:is is a sniperfrom
behindthe 3-pointstripe. He makes49 percentof
his 3-point shots averages 17.3 points per game,

In the past two contests, with Harangody .

nursing his knee, Abromaitis has scored 24 and
29 points. Anotherplayer who will need to play
wellfor Irish coachMikeBrey, is Mississippi State
transfer Ben Hansbrough, who is shootingwith a
45 percent success rate from beyond the arc and
averaging12.1 points per game.

As Notre Dame looks for someonetocarrythe
offensive load, the Pantherswillfocus on continu-
ingto spread thewealth. '

At the beginning of the season, it looked as
if Ashton Gibbs were thesole scoring threat for
the Panthers. Now Gibbs, Brad Wanamaker, Gil-
bert Brown andjermaine Dixon are all averaging
double-ﬁgures points per game. I ‘

The success of those four, combined with the
recent emergence of redshirt freshman Travon
Woodall, makes it diﬁicultfor opponentstopredict
who the ball is goingto on a given possession.

“Thafs something that excites me about our
team. We ran sets for four or ﬁve different guys
downthest1'etch[oftheV'illanovagame].Wereally
do _havebalance,”Pitthead coachjamie Dixon said

7 after Siinday’s 70-65 win over Villanova.

fro Dixon, Pitt’s growing balance shows pro-
gression and improvement on the court.

“We’ve probably improved as much as any
team in the country from November to Febru-
ary,” Dixon said. “Butwesu'll have plenty of room

‘to improve and plenty of things that we can do

better.”

The improved Pantherbimchwillface the bot-
tom halfof the Big East to close out the season,
while conference leaders Syracuse and Villanova
playeach otherFeb. 27. Since Pitt holds tiebreakers
overboth the Orange and the Wildcats, a regular-
seasonconferenceisattainable ifthe Panthersbeat

Notre Dame inthe series history, but, when trav-
