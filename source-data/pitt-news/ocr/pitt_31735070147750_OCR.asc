Pitt tuition increase set at 8.5 percent

Brendan Owens
Staff Writer

Pitt’s tuition will increase 8.5 per-
cent this year for in—state students
and 4 percent for out— of—state stu-
dents as part of the University’s
$1.94 billion budget announced
Friday.

Tuition for a full academic
year will go up $1,196 for Penn-
sylvania residents, from $14,076
to $15,272, while out-of-state
students’ tuition will increase to
$24,680, up $948 from last year.
This marks the largest in-state
tuition increase at Pitt since 2003,
when tuition went up by more
than $1,500. 1

But Pitt students will get a little
more help in the fall. Pitt’s ﬁnan-

cial aid budget will increase by 4

$13 million, and more than $163
million in ﬁnancial aid should be
made available inithe next ﬁscal
year, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg said at the Board of Trustees
Executive Committee meeting that
‘decided the budget. V.
The $13 million extra in ﬁnan-

cial aid comes from reserves and '

discounted tuition, said Patricia
Beeson, provost and senior vice
chancellor, on Tuesday.

Beeson said that the money
didn’t go toward thetuition hike
because “this allows us to target it
more to those who need it.”

The state ﬁnancial aid agency
will also increase its grants for
the next year.

“We put a priority on trying to
shoulder as much of the load as
we could and we had pledged not
to put the entire weight of these
reductions  onto the shoulders
of our students,” Nordenberg

    

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, Michael Brys

said. “We did meet that pledge
with the budget that was approved
today.”

Pittofﬁcials said that the tu-
ition hike would cover 40 percent
ofa $40 million cut in state aid to
the University, while the rest will
be covered by reduced spending.
The Board of Trustees’ Execu-
tive Committee also approved a
2 percent salary increase for Pitt
employees.

Faculty members making less
than $40,000 per year will enjoy
their increase retroactive to July
1, while those making more than
that amount won’t see their in-

crease untiljan. 1.

Nordenberg and other board
members blamed the rise in tu-
ition on Pitt’s appropriations bill
that Gov. Tom Corbett signed into
law on June 30. The other three
state—related universities face
similar funding cuts, but among
them only Temple University has
announced its in—state tuition
rate for the fall — a 10 percent
increase. A

In addition, Pitt’s tuition last
year ranked as the second most
expensive public university in the

sity which has not yet announced

decrease in_Pitt’s state funding
in more than a decade. Thetotal

priation of $135 million. Last year,
the University received more than
$184 million, including more than
$10 million in federal stimulus
funds that ran out this year.

Pitt ranks secondin the nation,
at least, forhow much it costs to
attend compared to other public
universities.

The Department of Educa-
tion listed. Pitt’s tuition last year,
$14,154, as the second-most ex-
pensive nationally. It’s unclear

where Pitt will rank after this ~

year’s 8.5 percent tuition hike
as the most expensive public
school — Penn State University
at $14,416 —' hasn’t announced
its tuition yet.

Penn State’s tuition will likely
also increase this year after the

‘ legislature cut about aﬁfth of both

schools? funding..

Pennsylvania’s 14 state—owned
schools are facing a tuition in.-
crease of 7.5 percent, which was
approved by the governing board
of the State System of Higher Edu-

s cation. None of those 14 schools

made the department’s most-
expensive list.

All 14 state schools have the
same in-state tuiton of $5,804,
except Cheyney University with
an in-state tuition of $5,544.

The national average tuition
among public schools is $6,397,
less than half of Pitt’s and Penn
State’s tuition.

The Department of Education
compiled the list by conducting
a survey for schools that partici-
pate in the department’s Title IV
Student Aid Program, which in-
cludes any school that receives

.a type of federal funding for any

type of funding or loans. For the
past few years, these schools have
been required to complete a sur-

vey where they report data such-

as tuition fees, graduation rates,
enrollrnent‘,’etc'.

“In 2008, Congress reautho—
rized the Higher Education>Act
that became the Higher Education
Opportunity Act, and Congress in
that bill askedus to compile these
lists byjuly ﬁr“ of 2011,” Depart-
ment of Education spokeswoman
Sarah Gast said.

Gast said she couldn’t com-
ment on how Pitt and Penn State
would rank in similar lists in the
near future without the knowledge
of what other state schools are do-
ing with their tuition rates.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele,
and other Pitt officials, attributed
the ranking to a low level of state
support for higher education —

1 Percent Change  
2011-2012

Mike Macagnone &
Mallory Grossman '
‘The Pitt News Staﬁ"

Five people made most of the deci-
sions about Pitt’s budget this year,
including tuition hikes. The process
differed from the University’s usual
committee-based reccomendation
process which includes student in-
put.

Provost Patricia Beeson said that
she, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
Vice Chancellor Art Ramicone, Se-
nior Vice_Chancellor Arthur Levine
and Executive Vice Chancellor Je-
rome Cochran worked off of general
reccomendations that a University- '
wide committee made months be-_
fore the state ﬁnalized its appro-
priations for the University.

The University altered its usual
process because of the wide range
of potential funding cuts Pitt faced
— intially as high as 50 percent —

- Beeson said. She said that therehas

never been this big of a budget is-
sue and there has certainly never
been such a cut from the Common-
wealth. ,

But even though this has been
“a very difficult and painful several
months,” Beeson said that the Uni-
versity tried to make sure no one
group at Pitt had to bear the whole
burden of the 22 percent funding
cuts ﬁnalized two weeks ago. ~

The ﬁve administrators had
worked on the budget for months,
coming up with avariety of possible
budgets for when the state passed

Pitt’s funding. The group sought
input from a number of sources,
including number—crunching from
Ramicone’s staff in the ofﬁce of the
budget and controller.

When the state passed its bud-
get, and Pitt’s 22 percent cut, the
ﬁve administrators still had work
to do. ~

“There are no easy choices in
this situation,” Beeson said. “Even
when you have a plan, there’s still
angst and kicking the tires.”

_ Once Nordenberg approved a
plan though, the group made its
recommendation to the Board of

Trustees, which approved the bud— ’
1 get last week. I .
“When the boss decides on

something we buckled down and
said ‘this is what we’re going to do”’

' Ramicone said.

Most years —— even in 2009,
when the state, passed its budget
more than four months late —— plan-
ning starts at the department level.
Those reccomendations then go to
school committees, to a provost’s
committee and ﬁnally to a Univer-
sity—wide committee that reports to
Nordenberg. . .

Each committee has at least one

student representative, in addition

to staff, faculty and administrators,
Beeson said. There are two student
representatives on each committee,
one undergraduate and one gradu-
ate student, who are recommended
by SGB.

A ‘This year, instead of making spe-
ciﬁc “reccomendations for tuition

' increases and other portions of the

budget, the University—wide com-
mittee made three generalpriority
recommendations to Nordenberg
in late April. This allowed the ﬁve-
member group to ﬁnalize a budget
once the state passed Pitt’s appro-
priation.

The top‘ three priorities included
keeping tuition low, minimizing
budget cuts and giving minimal
salary increases, Beeson said.

Pitt’s budget included an 8.5
percent tuition increase, yet-to-be-

ﬁnalized cuts to the budget, and la 2 '

percent salary increase for faculty.
When makingbudget decisions,
the ﬁve senior administrators con-

sulted Ramicone’s staff, students ,

and other members of the Univer-

sity community, Beeson said, al- ,_
though the outside advisors didn’t
have the same level of inputas the A

ﬁve.
Ramicone said that the students
they consulted focused f‘almost
solely” on tuition increases.
Though Beeson said that admin-
istrators will try to avoid it, students

. may see some effects of the cuts,

such as larger class sizes. She also
declined to comment on what pro-

grams the ‘University might cut as or

a result of the budget, saying it was
“too early to know” and she was
still in conversations with various
school deans. ‘

Ramicone said that although the
22 percent cut is a victory over Gov.
Tom Corbett’s original 50 percent,
the overall $27.15 billion state bud-
get is only down 4 percent. Over
the past eight years, inﬂation has

gone up 20 percent, the state bud-
get has gone up 40 percent and the
budget for K-12 education is up 60
percent. During that eight year pe-
riod, higher education funding has
remained ﬂat. And this year it faces
drastic funding cuts.

“You get numb to the process,”
Beeson said. “Getting from 50 per-
cent to the 22 percent cut was a vic-
tory, but the fact that we started at
50 percent is very concerning and
the fact that we ended up where we
did is still concerning even though
it was a victory.” ’

Ramicone said that even if the

committees had given their input, 5

the University might have reached
a similar result. Pitt can only alter
a certain portion of its budget,
which basically amounts to the state
appropriation and tuition, when

. reaching its budget.With the 22 per-

cent funding cuts that Pitt received
from the state, Ramicone said that
diffcult choices had to be made and
they were left with a “selection of
bad choices.” They spent months
deciding where cuts in the budget

would cause the least damage.

Beeson said that they had to

* look long-term when constructing

the budget and had to ﬁnd ways to

_ maintain the quality of programs

at Pitt.

Tuition and the state appro-
priation are the main aspects of
the budget that can be changed,

_ Ramicone said. The federal gov-

ernment doesn’t let Pitt divert the
$800 million it receives in research
funding, and the University only

* Budget process differed from previous years

uses auxiliary fees, such as room l

and board to cover those expenses.
In addition, endowments given by
individuals have very little ﬂexibil-

- ity, both legally and through agree- A

-ments with donors.

In addition, Ramicone said the
University’s health care costs, soft-
ware licensing fees, real estate in-
surance and property maintenance
costs go up each year, regardless of
the budgeting process. Also, when
the student population grows or Pitt
adds buildings to campus, utility
fees go up to handle the extra elec-
tricity, water, heating and cooling
those buildings use.

Even though tuition will rise by
$1,196 for in-state students, Beeson
said that it could have been much
worse. If Pitt had raised tuition
without any budget cuts, the hike
would have been more than $1,500.
If the stat had passed Gov. Tom Cor-
bett’s original 50 percent cut, Pitt
might have raised tuition by about
20 percent, she said.

Beeson said Pitt’s tution is
straightforward compared to other
universities. She compared Pitt’s
tuition to that of Penn State, which
increases tuition when students
move from. lowerclassmen to up-
perclassmen. Likewise, the 14 state-

5 system schools will charge students

an increase of 2 percent for fees on
top of the 7.5 percent increase in
tuition. ~

es were avoided this year because

Pet owners in economic strife can

local organization kicked off its
annual “Chow Wagon” last month
at Pitt.

The program Pitt’s People for
Pets assists people who are in
tough economic situations by
helping owners to feed their pets

and in doing so, avoid worries,

about mistreatment or malnu-
trition.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said the need for the program was
brought to attention by Commu-
nity Human Services, an organi-
zation that operates the Oakland
food pantry.

“They told us that a number
of people who use the food bank

began when concerned food

were using the food from the
food banks to feed their pets.
The Chow Wagon is in its fifth

in state support. This includes the

.19 percent reduction to general

appropriation and a 50 percent
reduction to Pitt’s academic medi-
cal center funding. , '
Nordenberg said that Penn-
sylvania ranked 46th out of 50
states for. per capita support for
higher education before the most
recent cuts. . .
Pitt also faces unavoidable ex-
pense increases, such as health
insurance, facilities costs, tech-
nology improvements and licens-
ing fees, according to a statement
sent out by the University after

» the meeting.

The estimated $30 million it
would cost for these investments
is expected to create a total budget
gap exceeding $70 million, Nor-
denberg said in a statement issued

' at the meeting.

That gap will be covered by
cost— cutting, budget adjustments
and increased revenue streams,
including tuition, said Art Rami-

cone, Pitt’s vice chancellor for
budget and controller.

Nordenberg was visibly upset
at the meeting and said that it
was difficult for‘him to break the
news to students and staff about
Pitt’s funding after the amount
was ﬁnalized. ‘

“It was a dark day for Pitt and
for all of higher education — not
onlybecause of the steep budget
cuts, but because of the lack of
regard for the work we do, which
seemed to be reﬂected in those
proposals,” he said.

Student Government Board
president Molly Stieber was also
upset about the budget cuts and
said she worried about higher ed-
ucation under the new governor.

_ “It is clear that Pitt didn’t put
the entire burden of the tuition
increase on students. They could
have made a higher percentage,
which I really appreciate,” Stieber
said. ‘.‘Higher education is not a
priority [in Harrisburg], and that

P  Unavoidable expenses addto totalb»

is the problem.”
Stieber and other student lead-
ers across the state organized pro-

‘tests of the governor’s proposed
50 percent cuts to higher edu- ‘‘

cation funding — efforts which
largely died off at the end of the
school year.

Even though student" fees will
remain the same along with Pitt’s
tuition structure — which does not
change based on a student’s year
— recent graduate Brad Heibert
said this was not enough.

“It’s like a bucket of water.

They are going to keep raising
tuition adding drop after drop
after drop. One day it’s going to
overﬂow and become unattract-
ive,” Heibert said. “Pitt is a good
school. Our academics are rising
with the prices, but it’s going to
get to the point where it’s so ex-
pensive that kids aren’t going to

want to go to Pitt and [instead]
5 go to a comparable school that is

less expensive.” '

years ago. And while students are focused
on tuition, he said the University has 12,000
faculty and staff members to consider.

Ramicone said that most faculty at Pitt are
already paid less on average than the other
three state-related schools. The faculty and
staff at Pitt are competing on a national level,
and an investment of this importance this
needs to maintained,‘ or risk other schools
“raiding” Pitt’s departments, he said.

‘One of the most important aspects of the
budget cuts was to make sure that the cuts do
not impact the classroom, Beeson said.

She said that University decision makers
have to take into account the shifts in student
demands and the University’s sense of what
is important.

Beeson said that Pitt will likely still move
forward with a number of new academic
programs in the next few years, which will
consist mostly of certiﬁcate programs. These
frequently take existing classes that students
already use for different courses of study and
restructure them into a 15 to 20 credit cer-
tiﬁcate.

Pitt to add programs

Beeson said that the University will con-
tinue its outreach to inﬂuential legislators in
Harrisburg and will keep alive the discussion
about the importance of higher education in
Pennslyvania.

Beeson said that “many people were in-
volved in getting legislators to undersand
what the value of an education is to students
at Pitt.” '

“Despite everything negative, that was a
real positive about the whole thing,” Beeson
said.

Beeson said that even with the state fund-
ing cuts and the tuition increases, there are
still bright aspects of the situation.

“Everybody wants a lot of the same things
for the Unviersity. They want the University to
remain an excellent provider of undergradu-

' ate education and the faculty and staff and

students all want that and are willing to sac-
riﬁce in different ways,” Beeson said. “There
is a real core belief in what the University
should be and a real strongfeeling that we
want to maintain what we have and continue
to advance the institution.”

whether or not they have any safety issues. So far, six participants have completed the

study, and ﬁve more are set to enroll.

The other study is a one-year FDA safety
study that will start in eitherjuly or August

with Carnegie Mellon’s Roboticslnstitute
to test things like facial recognition that
will make the camera “kind of smart” and
enhance ability for users’ independence.

Nau has high hopes for the device and
said that it has “bright and significant
promise.”

tient has been able to do things they haven’t
been able to do before: detect doors, press

EDITORIAL ,-

All aboard the Wiki train  

We’re all Wikipedians now. Or at least
wewillbe some day, as we watch Wiki-
pedia.org ascend the respect ladder

among U.S. academics. .

Lastweek, the Wikimedia Founda-
tion held theﬁrst“WikipediainHigher
Education Summit,” where the orga-
nization convened college professors

. who deliberately use — or intend to
use —_ the publicly edited Web-based ‘

encyclopedia as a teaching tool. Ac-
cording to Inside Higher Ed, two
dozen universities, including George
Washington.University and Harvard,
now offer courses that require work
on Wikipedia as part of the semester
grade. This is the resultofwikimedias
“Public Policy Initiative,”which sought
to recruit college faculty and students
to the Wikipedia cause, starting with
public policy classes. The participants
were not paid. I

' After being verbally whipped by
our high school teachers wheneverwe
asked ifwe could cite Wkipedia.orgfor
our ﬁve—paragraph essays, our eyes
grew wide with disbelief at this news:
Professors are willingly, earnestly
collaborating with the providers of

 

Wikipedia.

It’s just remarkable that a webser—
vice so long maligned by academia is
nowattractingsuchpositive attention.
Though one should note that the atten-
tio_n’s not necessarilytherebecausethe
reliability of the contenthas increased;
rather, it seems certain college faculty
are buying into the underlying cause of
Wikipedia. And with reﬂection, that’s
not so surprising —— the missions of
both Wikipedia and institutions of
higher education are, in large part, to
exchange knowledge with the outside
world. Since good professors highly
prioritize educating the masses, it’s
no wonder they could ﬂock to the op-
portunity to involve their classes in an
efforttotouch many more peoplethan
a lifetime of intro classes could.

With highly reputed universities
now associating themselves with
Wikipedia — and the director of
the National Archives employing a
“Wikipedian in residence,” accord-
ing to Inside Higher Ed — the site’s

- gravitas is clearly on the way up. And
' so being, we think it’s time for college

students to adopt a major mindset

shift. Instead of treatingwikipedia in
the traditional manner-—locatingthe
desired factoids andthen goingon our
merryway—we needto starttreating
it as a public asset, like a local public
library, but digital and everywhere.
The way we accomplish that shift is
to recognize our responsibility to con-
tribute, not in dollars in cents, but by
our own knowledge.

If Wikipedia is indeed‘ the back-
bone aroundwhichthe sum ofhuman
knowledge will be compiled, college
students are right for the job of com-
pilation. As the results of the ongoing

Public Policy Initiative have indicated, '

we have resources at our disposal that
allow us to make high-quality contri-
butions: Classes that charge apremium
to enroll in, professors with decades of
experience and —- in Pitt’s case — ac-
cess to a wealth of scientiﬁc journals.
And though-The Pitt News might be
biased,  about what you’re in-
terested with hopes of educating the
masses is far more ﬁm than paying
taxes to support a local library. -
So, you heard us, stop cruising Fa-
cebook and get on Wikipedia. I

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Have no fear, Moustache

4 Oliver Bateman
Columnist

  

Since this is our last column of the
summer, we’ve decided to devote
it to the most important task of
all: Solving the world’s problems.
Although many of you might think
otherwise, it’s every bit as easy to
resolve seemingly intractable dif-
ﬁculties like Hurricane Katrina and
conﬂict in Darfur as it is to write
a killer online dating proﬁ_le'or
draft an awesome fantasy basket-
ball lineup. Given that space is at
a premium here in The Pitt News,
let’s quit fussing around and start
ﬁxing what ails the cosmos.

Big Problem No. 1: Oil. Those
of you who have cars know how

. expensive this stuff can be, and

even those of you who don’t prob-
ably have parents who are upset
about the whole oil situation. No
matter how you slice it, gas sure
costs a lot more than it once did.
What can be done? Are we des-
tined to default on our student

‘loans and adopt a life of crime to

afford enough fuel for a day trip to
Kennywood? Friends, this issue is
so simple that even a dull-witted

infant could ﬁgure it out: Sell a car ,,

to every person on the planet. The
reasoning behind this solution is
that more cars will lead to more
drilling, since drilling is how we
get precious oil. Once every patch
of empty, unused land has been
drilled down to the earth’s core, we
will have access to so much black
gold that gas stations will have to

' pay customers to take it off their

hands. Not only-that, but we’ll have
to develop thousands of great new
roads and parking garages to ac-
commodate the inﬂux of vehicles.
Remember how great it was when
Schenley Plaza was just a parking
lot? Pretty soon'we’ll be paving
that big green waste of space and
erecting a 3.0-story garage there.
Big Problem No. 2: Student loan
debt. Later this year, the amount
of outstanding‘ student loan debt
will crack $1 trillion. Although that
doesn’t sound like much in the

grand scheme of things — port-

ly pitcher C.C. Sabathia alone is
worth $150 million, after all — it’s
a high price to pay to make Intro to
Psychology available to the masses.
Instead of college —- which, let’s
face it, is super nerdy 4- people
should start taking advantage
of the ‘exciting free lives that are"
already at their ﬁngertips. Why
aspire to become an astronaut or

and devote your life to becoming

or the greatest Super Smash Bros.
player the world has ever seen? Not
only that, but if you get yourself

Big Problem No. 3: The crime

'wave. As evidenced by the not
. guilty verdict in the Casey Anthony

Trial of the Century, in this land
there is no justice to be had any-
where. Criminals run wild on our
streets, slaughtering at will, and
the police are powerless to stop
them. For how much longer will
we tolerate mass murder, you ask?
Well, we’ll tolerate it until someone
produces an awesome reality show
in which contestants —— preferably

THE STAMATTACK

Infuse steeltown developments with personality

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

.I ,can’t imagine many land develop-

ers enjoy the prospect of an assign-
ment in Pittsburgh. '
After all, when you travel to
any shopping development inlthe
area, you will hardly ﬁnd anything
inspiring. Even with a relatively
strong retail market — accord-
ing to Cushman 8: Wakeﬁeld Real
Estate — few new developments
exhibit any unique characteris-
tics. Not many developers have
seemed to want to move beyond
the cookie cutter, formulaic shop-

of the country. .

pingdistricts that populate n_1uc_lir.;

trendy areas you might have come
across as a Pitt student. The Water-
front — built on the remnants of
an old steel mill — has no unique
features besides a row of old
smokestacks and afew other relics
from the Steel Age. It’s difﬁcult to

H distinguish the location from any

other in the country. Two newer
developments — Settlers Ridge in
Robinson and Pittsburgh Mills in
Tarentum — share a similar bland-

ness, amounting to nothing more

than lifestyle centers atop newly.

ﬂattened hills.

It isn’t that these centers aren’t
pleasant places or that they don’t
serve their functions. Residents
and students alike still ﬂock to
these areas. Furthermore, exam-

ples like Bakery Square in East I

Liberty and Station Square on the
South Side serve as exceptions,
with both plans featuring unique
usage of old buildings. The prob-
lem is that most of the time when
developers in the region set out
to create a new plan from scratch,

V most fail to utilize all the unique

features of the area and thusdo a

'3 I disservice to themselves and to _,
C futurelgenerations. '  -
r Consider even some of the mar ‘

An example analogous to th
Waterfront where developers were
more creative" is the Inner Harbor,
a massive entertainment com-
plex in downtown»Balt_imore that
turned dilapidated warehouses
into upscale retail and residential
space. Some old buildings were
reused,‘maintaining a sense of his-
tory for the space. And developers
fully embraced the bay, making
it a true focal point that provides
space for regattas, panoramic

views of the. city and a refreshing
atmosphere.

Contrast the Inner Harbor with
the cookie—cutter Waterfront — an
admittedly smaller project —-— and
the differences are stunning.

Providing yet another instance
in which a city embraced a land-
scape rather than built around
it is Hong Kong; The city has a
mountainous cityscape — like
Pittsburgh’s —— and redeveloped
a large, formerly derelict area on
the side of a large hill into a trendy
entertainment district through a
network of escalators. While the
project was overbudget, rider-
ship today exceeds expectations,
and now the Cent-ral-Mid—levels

* . escalators’ serve as a destination

in their own right, according to
BBC News.

This stands in stark contrastto
another Pittsburgh development
that instead tried to ignore the
hills — the proposed Walmart in
Kilbuck Township, several miles

downstream from Downtown-

Pittsburgh. Rather than embrac-

' ing a more landscape-conscious

design, contractors in 2006 at-
temptedto build a standard shop-
ping center atop a blasted hill near

the Ohio River, resulting in land-
slides” that covered Route 65 for
several months. The Walmart was
never completed.-

The projects in Hong Kong.

and Baltimore were risky by some
standards. Escalators hadn’t been
used for transit before, and few
other cities had rebuilt a decay-
ing urban core. Yet in retrospect,
theses solutions were optimal for
the situation -— moreconventional
projects simply didn’t offer the po-
tential beneﬁts. For Pittsburgh and
any city to move forward, ofﬁcials
need to understand that this is of-
ten the case, and a single formula
doesn’t exist for successful devel-
opment. _ . 
«One idea .that has been ﬂoat-

‘ ing around the Internet for a few

years is for an urban gondola in
Pittsburgh to connect East End
neighb0,ljh.Oods and the South
Side. By traditional standards, it

is not a good idea. No other U.S. "

city maintains such a system,‘ so
there are no benchmarks for how
much such a project would cost
or how many commuters it would
take off the roads.

Yet for Pittsburgh, an urban"
gondala project might be perfect.

After all, the terrain and density of
the area make additional light rail
prohibitively expensive and slow,
so a “conservative” transit solu-
tion like extending the T to new
areas doesn’t make much sense.
Plus, while other cities often try
to connect their airports to the
rail system, Pittsburgh’s airport is
not only less trafﬁcked but farther
away than most‘ other cities’,'pri-
oritizing projects elsewhere.
Regardless of the ﬁnal prac-

ticality of such a plan, it cannot

be dismissed at the start. The “it

t worked there, itkwill work here”

mentality led to ‘a landslide in
Kilbuck and a less-than—optima1
shopping center in Homestead.
Like any  future project, de-
velopem“’ni*i$f-1o91<‘at.{a-city?S..épé—
ciﬁc traits and develop the*rrio'st
sensible projects from there.

Pitt students traveling to the
suburbs or other regions of the
city should be able to ﬁnd places to
shop and dine that have personal-
ity. The current-strategy of plop-
ping generic developments around
the region does not do justice to
the quality of the area. . A

Big Problem N o. 4: Darfur and
so forth. Regardless of how fun it
is to rock a comfy American Ap-
parel tri—blend T-shirt emblazoned
with “Save [Insert Hip Regional
Hotspot Here]” on it, the time has
come for us to address the plight
of people trapped in various out-
of—the-way locations. Fortunately,
the top—ranked political scientist
Thomas Friedman has already
developed an iron-clad law of na-

ture that provides our solution:
No two countries with McDonald’s
restaurants, Starbucks cafés and
combination Taco Bell/ Pizza Hut/
Longjohn Silver’s franchises have
ever gone to war with one another.
In order to resolve these danger-
ous conﬂicts without bloodshed
but instead plenty of delicious $1
burritos, we must subsidize the
construction of as many institutes
of higher eating as possible. Then
jobs will become more plentiful

than ever before — can you imag-
ine how many cashiers. a nation
with more than 1 million Taco Bell/
Pizza Hut/Longjohn Silver’s mega-
restaurants would employ? And

for countries in the grip of brutal .

famines, we could simply borrow
a page from the Oakland model
and build $5 pizzerias (scaled to
whatever the local equivalent of
$5 is, of course) until the entire
population reaches epic propor-
tions. Since we once used a diet of

three $5 pizzas a day to hardgain 75
pounds, we can personally attest
to its efficacy. .
There you have it, folks. In one
terse—yet-compelling column, we
have crafted a blueprint for success
that might even surpassothe glori-
ous Constitution produced by our
nation’s godlike Founding Fathers.
Meanwhile, over in Washington,
those legislative lazybones are
busy trying to squeeze more pork
into various pork-ladenbills that

bystocking it with fast food chains

are already ﬁlled to bursting with
pork. And that’s just not kosher.

Health and history have joined
forces to try to get folks to take the
stairs. - A
The Senatorjohn Heinz History
Center and UPMC Health Plan have
paired up to create ~a -permanent
exhibit: Smartsteps. It’s a combi-
nation of Pittsburgh history and
health—smart facts and tips that
now grace six levels of stairwells
at the Heinz History Center. Out-
side of the stairwells the center has
exhibits spanning across the his-
tory of Pittsburgh —— from ﬁghts

on battleﬁelds to struggles on the

city’s sports ﬁelds.

When visitors choose to take the
stairs rather than the elevator, they
will experience this new feature. The
exhibit has been designed to pro-
vide both information about daily
caloric requirements and different
aspects of Pittsburgh history. Indi-
vidual steps within the exhibit often
feature different historical facts or
carry the name of famous individu-
als throughout history.

There is no extra cost for visi-
tors to participate in the Smartsteps
exhibit as it is part of the center’s
general admission. In fact, all visi-
tors to the Heinz History Center are
encouraged to take the stairs and
experience the displays in the hall-
ways, history center communica-
tions manager Brady Smith said.

The exhibit isn’t leaving the Hei-
nz History Center any time soon.

Smartsteps exhibit with their own

to make the displays a permanent
part of the experience at the venue.

Smith assisted in the collecting and '

display of the six exhibits.

“We have worked closely with
UPMC for the different themes
featured on each level,” Smith said,
adding that the partnership between
the two Pittsburgh businesses made
sense to him. “Also, all the healthy
tips came from UMPC. These tips
that visitors will learn are ones that
will inspire a healthier lifestyle.”

Smith went on to call the UPMC
Health Plan an “all§F’ to the Heinz
History Center’s developing healthy
initiative. The museum has recently
changed the menu of its café to pro-
vide healthier options.

that’s  just ﬁne, but in a_jnice_ breezy
Westcoastkind ofway. ~’

The band’s lyrics, forthemostpart,
are just so-so.

“Say You Like Me” is a song that
sounds like it’s sung by a cocky guy
trying to mask obvious insecurity.
The vocalist Travis Clark sings as such:
“She’s the girl that no one ever knows /
Works a double just to buy her clothes
/ Nicotine andpainted dreams / Baby-
justbelieve, there’s no one else like me,”
followed byachorus about not leaving
or giving up.

These lyrics are awfully presumptu-
ous ofthe factthat no one else wouldbe
interestedinﬂiiswoundedbird ofa 
but then askﬂiis same girl to just “say
you like me” inthe chorus.

And though the serni—ridiculous
verses continue through other songs,
they aren’t always for the worst.

“Sleep With Me” is reﬁeshingly can-
did. Forgetthe noses, lace and romance“
—thisguyhas“cheapwords andwine”
and damn it, he’d like Heather to sleep
with him without delay. But at the
very least, this song, which includes
abevyoffaop songcliches suchas the
lyric Slllttel‘, “you’ve got myeheart b;
beating tonight,” sets itselfapart with
bluntnass. ' ‘

Sunshine album just OK

We The Kings 4 9

And all this time I thought boy bands sang a

love jams because theywanted some sweaty, hot,
intense hand—holding. I’ve been duped. ,

But aside from this salacious jam, the rest is
familiar subject matter— loneliness, infatuation,
asongto let someone know just how over herthe
singer really is, etc.

The music is just solid.

There are few, if any, bizarre music missteps,
but that seems to be because the band plays only
within the bbunds of convention.

. “The Secretto NewYork” is a perfect example
of this. The songtakes aforrnulaic approach—the

centerpiece super-catchy repetitive guitar riff that-

startsbefore the music swells withdrummingand
bass playing. Right before the chorus, the musi-

   

cians holdbackforasecond andthen let loose into

a loud, sing-shouted, harmonized chorus.

album. It makes for t.rac1<s that deﬁnitely warrant

"with this — the band just hasn’t taken any risks.

spending every single dollar on ﬂowers, vaca-

tions and general extravagance for a girl as long
as she’s spendingall hertime with the singer: OK,

gers climbing stairs. .

The second to the third ﬂoor exhibit pres- ' «

ents the theme “Pittsburgh: A Tradition of
Innovation.” '
From the third to the fourth floor, visitors
will ﬁnd a “Western Pennsylvania ‘Sports Mu-
seum.” This exhibit is equipped with a plethora

of different sports shoes as well as a baseball.

signed by Bill Mazeroski.

The theme on the fourth to the ﬁfth ﬂoor
is labeled “Heinz 57 and Rosie the Riveter.”-
This segment of the stairwell provides a mural
of Rosie the Riveter and an explanation of
why this female character was important to
Pittsburgh during World War II.

The ﬁfth to the sixth ﬂoor presents “Clash.

of Empires: The British, French & Indian War,”
and displays information about our country’s
beginnings.
Finally, the sixth ﬂoor’s exhibit is labeled
“Library & Archives and the Finish Line.”
Diane Holder, president of the UPMC
Health Plan, said the stairs will encourage
more people to exercise. “We hope this initia-
tive will be a fun and easy way to spread the
message about the beneﬁts of incorporating
light exercise into your day,” Holder said. “By
choosing activities that you can easilyﬁt into
a daily routine — such as taking the stairs
instead of the elevator — you can accumu-

late small amounts of exercise throughout
the day that can provide signiﬁcant health
beneﬁtsf’ ' A

The spirit of the Smartsteps exhibit mir-
rors Michelle Obama’s national initiative,

“Let’s Move! Museums and Gardens.” The '
ﬁrst lady’s mission is to keep kids moving ’

throughout the summer, thus promoting
healthier decisions for America’s youth. The
Smartsteps exhibit attempts to achieve the
same goals set out within the program.

Carrie Pazehoski, physical therapist for
Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy As-
sociates, Inc., agrees that kids can ‘beneﬁt
from the workout, but stresses that this new
exhibit might not be for everyone.

“I think that taking the stairs is great, espe-
ciallyfor kids. If the person has any physical
determents or issues, however, I think the
elevator is always a better choice. Because
the kids will be stopping on each ﬂoor to look
around and not walking up six ﬂights of stairs
at once, I think it is a healthy choice to make,”
she said. -

Smith mentioned that the exhibit is par-

ticularly geared toward children. I
“So far, kids are really happy with it,” Smith
said. When a visitor forgoes the elevator, she
receives a stamp at each of the six levels of the
museum. Six stamps traded in at the gift shop
will get the visitor a Heinz pickle pin. I, '

Put on your 3-D glasses and_grab a box of
tissues, because it’s time for the end of an
era. Harry Potter is ﬁnally over, 14 years
after the ﬁrst book hit shelves.

But despite the decade-long buildup, the
epic climax of a childhood franchise didn’t
reach its peak, leaving viewers with a tinge
of unsatisfaction. '

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his

best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and ,

Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) have
destroyed three of the evil Lord Voldemort’s
(Ralph Fiennes) seven horcruxes -— items in
which Voldemort placed pieces of his soul
to keep him immortal. The ﬁlm follows the

trio on their quest not onlyto destroy the -

remaining horcruxes, but also to defeat
Voldemort and his Death Eater disciples.

 'f>Harry  ‘Deathly Hallows:
- Part 2 is not the best ﬁlm of the series; what

it does, it does well, but not as well as its _

predecessors. Its tension was not as realistic
or gripping as the ﬁrst Deathly Hallows, its
pacing was too jarring compared to Half
Blood Prince and its CGI seemed unneces-
sary compared to “Prisoner of Azkaban”
or “Goblet of Fire.” It can be accepted as a
nice, lovely ending to the series, but fell a
bit short of the phenomenal ending which
fans expected.

Universi

 

The special effects haveimade leaps and
bounds since the ﬁrst ﬁlm, adding gorgeous
detail to amazing, breathtaking scenes.
There are also many beautiful overhead
shots that showcase how wonderful the
magical world can be, even at its worst.

Two such scenes that come to mindtake

. place when the Death Eaters are heading
up a cliff overlooking the area before Hog-
warts and when a swoopingcamera glides
past the burning Quidditch ﬁeld and toward
Hogwarts castle. * '

But the images aren’t always perfect, and
the CGI can look odd at times.

At points the computer imagery looks
lovely —— like in scenes featuring the gi-
ants — but others where it looks silly. In a
scene during which Harry and Voldemort
are tussling in the air, their faces look like
rubber. Oneshot of Voldemort is purely
laughable because of the misshapen quality
of his computer-generated face.

Characters at numerous points in the’
ﬁlm put the audience through gut—wrench—t
ing, painful and heartbreaking moments. A
montage showing the life of one character is
particularly poignant.—-due in part because
of the actor’s skill level-— and the anguish
is almost palpable.

The movie’s qualities are not all positive,
however. As far as lighting, there are points
at which the screen is so dark that it’s dif-

tr;

e Harry Potter finale falls short of perfect ending

ﬁcult to seethe action without straining.
Even the slightest bit more light would have‘
made these scenes tolerable.

As far as the 3-D goes, it added some
really impressive details — a ﬂoating de-
inentor for example — but did not seem
to be used as well as it could have been.
Sometimes the feature was employed at
strange points, giving scenes an almost
hokey feel. "

The movie strays quite a bit from the
book, which is OK at times but a poor choice
at others. The ﬁnal ﬁght between Harry and
Voldemort is changed from the powerful
battle which everyone watches to a rather
cliched, one—on-one scene. It takes away
some of the beauty of the original book ﬁght
and, while still engaging, is not as momen-
tous as the one readers likely imagined.

The pacing of the ﬁlm is a bit strange.
It feels as though the plot-races by during-
the ﬁrst part, but then suddenly slogs more
slowly than molasses‘, eventually picking up
to a more normal pace for the rest of the
ﬁlm. In the ﬁrst half, so many crucial events

‘occur in such rapid succession that it’s dif- .

ﬁcult to keep up, and the initial speed makes
the slow middle particularly noticeable.
While certainly not the best Harry Potter
ﬁlm, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:
Part 2.” was still a gorgeous, overwhelming
and ﬁtting ending to an amazing series.  '

Pitt QB Sunseri attend

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

When Pitt quarterback Tino Sun-
seri received a phone call from an
'$nknown area code during his com-
munications class, he certainly wasn’t
expecting a voicemail from Archie
Manning.
Butwhen Sunseri excused himself
to listen to the message, the voice of
,;.the former Pro Bowl quarterback and
father of Super Bowl—winning quarter-
backs Peyton and Eli Manning asked
Sunseri to attend the Manning Passing
Academy.
There wasn’t much of a decision to
make. Sunseri immediately accepted
e offer. _
Fromjuly 7 tojuly 10, Sunseri and
29 other college football quarterbacks
spent four days at Nicholls State Uni-
versity in Thibodaux, La., learning
from the Mannings as well as former
@IFL head coachjon Gruden and draft
analyst Mike Mayock.
In return, Sunseri and the other
college quarterbacks ——~ players like

Stanford’s Andrew Luck and Boise
State’s Kellen Moore — worked with
1,200 junior high and high school
football players looking to make it
to the collegiate level. High school
coaches also attended the camp in
order to help with the younger play-
ers.

“It was kind oflike a ladder,” Sun— ‘

seri said atanews conference on Mon-
day. “When you’re a little kid, you’re
tryingto play college football and then

when you’re playing college football,

you’re trying to play in the NFL.”
This year markedthe 16th an-
niversary of the Manning Passing

Academy, which its website said aims .

“to create an environment of greater
understanding of, and the proﬁciency
with, the fundamentals, techniques,
skills, motivation, and sportsmanship
necessary for success at the individual
offensive skill positions in the sport
of football. We also strive to expand
the overall knowledge and strategy
of offensive play and defensive cov-
erage.” _ '-
The Manning Passing Academy
website also said that the Mannings

founded the camp to help teach foot-
ball ﬁindamentals to young players,

particularly those in high school.

“Itwas this concern that motivated
the Marmings to bringtogether some

of the most successful and brightest -

coaches and players from the profes-

sional, college and high school ranks,” V

the web site said. g
Sunseri ﬁrst heard about the camp

through formerAlabama quarterback
and current New Yorkjet Greg McEl-
roy. Sunseri’s father, Sal Sunseri, is an
assistant coachforAlabarna’s football
team. McElroy told Sunseri about his
experiences atthe camp and after Sun—

, seri expressed interest, McElroy said

he would talk to Archie Manning.

college .quarterbacks got the oppor-
tunity to work out with and around
the NFL quarterbacks. Sunseri said

the most important goal for him was _

to listen to and absorb their words
and actions. - _
“I was able to work behind Eli

Sunseri said Eli Manning told the
quarterbacks that if they were invited
to the camp, they already knew how to
throw. The_irnportant lessons tolearn

. were how to prepare in the offseason

and handle pressure in the pocket.-
He added that he learned two

. particularlyimportant lessons from

Peyton Manning: how to watch and
study tape and how to help the te
prepare on the ﬁeld. ‘
“Peytonwas able to go in and [tell]
us how he looked at things and how
he broke [tape] * down in the general
sense,” Sunseri said. “He told us how

he’s on a certain schedule so by the ‘

end of the Week, he understands and
he doesn’t forget whathe looked at
on Monday.”

Peyton Manning also brings his-
team out to the ﬁeld to make sure the
timing is down and that the players

q know their routes and where they are

expected to be, Sunseri said.
