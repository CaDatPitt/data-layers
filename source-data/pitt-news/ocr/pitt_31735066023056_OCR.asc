Pitt resident students had a late
and ‘rather unusual Christmas
present bestowed ‘upon them this
weekend when all residence hall
lobby phones malfunctioned allow-
ing students to call anywhere in the
world free of charge.

_ The lobby phones normally
restricted to “in house” inter-resi-
dence hall calls have reportedly
been malfunctioning since shortly
,following Thanksgiving.

“My roommate has been using
them since after Thanksgiving,”
said one student who wished to
remain anonymous;

According to one campus police-
‘man who also wished to go
unnamed, the university has been

to remedy the situation.

Several residence hall desk
attendants revealed that they were

reported it but ‘no results were

Student reactions and willing-

the lobby one night gooﬁng around
and we found out about it. Since

then my friends have been calling _

one student said.

“I would really like to do it and]

said. A

ETS Embraces Learning From The Cradle To The Grave

More and more adults are
becoming part of a new educational’
trend that some call f‘lifelong”
learning, according to the Educa-
tional Testing Service (ETS).

“The term ‘lifelong learning’ is

ﬁeally meant to embrace learning

from the cradle to the grave,” said
Dr. K. Patricia Cross, a research
scientist at ETS, in Berkeley, Calif.
“In practice, however, most people
talking about lifelong learning are

primarily concerned with adult_

learning because adults present the

\

new wrinkle in education.” .
Adults no longer graduate from
high school or college without_ ever
seeing a classroom again. In fact,
community colleges have begun
programs to attract the growing
number of adults interested: in

continuing their educations, ac-.

cording to ETS.

“By recent estimates, one of
every four adults is" currently
involved in some kind of organized
learning activity,” Cross said.
“Experts expect ‘that by the year

2000, when adults over 30 will
make up the - majority of the
population, even more adults will
be involved in some form of contin-
uing education.” - .

Higher education is becoming*
interested in adults because, of the
declining 18-year-old * population
and because of demand for further
educational opportunity by ' the
nation’s adult population.

The higher demand may‘: be
because more “than 80 percentof

school graduates,” a substantial
increase over past generations,
according to ETS.

..Cross said_ the more formal
education a personhas, the more
likely it is that he or she will seek
additional education. For example,
a college graduate is “eight times
more likely as a high _school drop-
‘ut to participate in adult educa-
tion.” ' ' V
But adults are not only interested
in enrolling in colleges to further

many need more technical educa-

Those adults seek adult schools,

opportunities to enhance their

“In many career ﬁelds the rate of

 

 

obsolescence is now pegged at in

Pitt's Ski club Active

Unlike a ﬁsh out of water, the
Pitt Ski Club is thriving without any
snow. Despite the low amounts of
snow coverin the area, “member-
ship is ‘up and the club is
expanding,” according to Pitt Ski
Club president Debbie Lendo.

“In fact, we’ve. just returned

added. , J

Port Authority To Discuss Fore

The Port Authority of Allegheny
County will hold public hearings
January 30 to discuss proposed fare
increases that could increase the
cost of travel in the Central Zone
from the present 50-cent fare to 60
cents.

The hearings will take place at
the Downtown YMCA, Wood St.
and Fourth Ave., at 1:30 p.m. and 7
p.m. so that residents of Allegheny
County “will have an opportunity
to express their views,” according
to PAT.

While the inﬂation rate has risen
about 30 percent since 1976 and the
United States has experienced
double-digit inﬂation during the
past year, PAT fares have not
changed in about four years,
according to James R. Maloney,
executive director of PAT.

“In the past four years, prices of
essential goods and services have‘
escalated at unprecedented rates, ”
said Maloney. “We’ve seen prices
go up 30 and 40 percent and double
in some cases: in auto fuel and

repairs, parking fees, home heat-
ing, electricity, insurance, school
and municipal taxes in some local
communities, and other items in
the family budget.” 1

During the same period, both the
cost of operating PAT and the
demand for its services due to the
energy crisis increased while fares
did not, Maloney added.

Because the government contin-
ually warned of an energy crisis,
PAT added more drivers, further

Promises by the federal and state
governments for aid to defray the
increased operating costs have not
been kept, Maloney said.

Increasing fares will defray some
of the operating expenses. Mal-
oney said. However, he added
PAT still needs the federal and
state aid. W

“In the absence of increased

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

The University of Pittsburgh will not be publishing a “Student
Directory” in 1979-80 according to Charlene C. Hunter from the

Office of Special Student Services. There will, however, be an
“in-house” directory which is to be used by several administrative
offices including the Office of Student Affairs. The “in-house”
directory is used to locate students, inform news media of student
accomplishments and respond to legitimate external requests for
information regarding students.

In order to produce this directory the University must according
to the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students” more commonly
referred to as the “Buckley Amendment,” afford students the

opportunity to remove their names and personally identifiable

information for the directory.
Mrs. Hunter indicated that she hopes that ‘few students will
exercise this right because the types of releases made by the

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Eight months
after the nuclear accident at Three
Mile Island, Pennsylvania con-
gressmen are evenly divided over
whether to limit new construction

~ of atomic power plants.

But predictably, House members
whose districts lie closest to the
Harrisburg, Pa., site are likely to
favor a —temporary moratorium on
nuclear growth.

And those pennsylvania con-
gressmen whose districts escaped
the trauma of the nationa’s worst
commercial nuclear accident over-
whelmingly voted against a mora-
torium recently on the issue’s first
House showdown.

v Last week, the House defeated
254 to 135, an amendment to stop
construction of new plants for the

first six months of ﬁscal ‘I980.
The measure, the ﬁrst chance for
the House to go on record on
‘nuclear power since TMI, lost 12-10
among Pennsylvania members.

“If every congressman went
through the scare as I did, then you
would have an awful lot of them

voting against nuclear power, too,”
said Rep. Robert Walker, R-
Lancaster, whose 16th district lies
immediately south of TMI. Until
this year he was a consistent
upporter of nuclear energy.

‘ “If you read all the statistical
evidence, deal with the govern-

ment and realize that the Nuclear

Regulatory Commission is a paper
tiger, you would realize, as I did,
that we don’t have adequate safety
mechanisms in place,” Walker
said.

Rep. Allen Ertel, D-Williams-
port, whose district includes TMI,

 Pa. Congressmen Divide On Issue Of Atomic Construction

agreed that the NRC must prove its
competence as nuclear overseer
before construction of new plants is
permitted.

“We have no one in America
looking overthe shoulders of the
industry which is not competent to
insure safety,” Ertel said.

It was undoubtedly with good intentions that

‘director of student activities Andy Smith and

assistant director Jack Brown approached the

 . planning of this past weekend’s Office of Student
' ‘ Activities-Student Government orientation weekend.

The weekend escape at Our Lady of Hope Retreat

3 -Center in Monroeville was geared to giving the newly
‘elected board members and fledging Allocation
2 _' Committee _ members A
_' managerial skills, while developing some channels
- '. of communication between the groups.

some insight into basic

- Smith and Brown enlisted the aid of theree persons
from the schools of education, and community and

V“ mental health, to conduct 10 seminars covering
,__topics such as learning how to keep sight of goals and

priorities, and offering knowledge of how students,
faculty, administration and staff operate.

We can certainly applaud the efforts of Smith and
Brown to bring some order to the often chaotic,
uneffective workings_of our student government.

In the past the Student Government Board has

'2 faltered, unable to bring any final resolution to issues

 

such as the rerouting or the campus bus. It was not
until its final week in office last year that the board
actually made any tangible gains for students, with
the development of a proposal-to increase the existing
$12 student activities fee. '

These shortcomings might have been avoided if the
board had been more knowledgeable at the outset of
the complexities of university bureacr_acies and how
to work around them.

Some student organizations and governance
groups also suggested that the SGB Allocations
Committee might not have fairly represented the
needs of all students in its annual budget processes
last year. It may not be necessary for these
accusations to, be made —next year, if the tailor-
designed weekend of seminars geared especially to

A the annual budget hearing processes were effective.

There is only one“reality of life at Pitt” that Smith
and Brown failed to consider when planning the SGB
escape weekend, this being the proverbial shrinking
dcillar, or rather the lack of these dollars among
student organizations at the University of Pittsburgh.

The price tag for this weekend retreat was placed at
a minimum of $1,020, paid through the SGB’s'
general account, funded solely be the student
activities fee.

Page 6—Monday, January 14, 1980

At a time when Pitt’s student organizations are
operating on often times the bare necessities, it only
seems right that the Office of Student Activities itself
should encourage some type of austerity program.

Time and time again, organizations have held »

equally effective, day-long, secluded seminars ‘within
the confines of the university, at a substantially
smaller cost than what it took to transport, house
and feed 20 persons in Monroeville this weekend.

One example of such effective training sessions are
those run by the Office of New Student Programs for
the freshman orientation mentor program.

The mentors participate in monthly sessions
training them to act as peer counselors to incoming

freshmen, a method that has yielded a high level of‘

success at a low cost.

" It is a step in the right direction to make student
organizations what Smith termed “laboratories”
rather than just “busy work-.” Student organizations
should be learning experiences, all the while instilling
some air of professionalism in members. We can
only hope that Andy Smith and. his student activities
staff will have learned the lesson of frugality’ when
planning their next escape weekend at the student’s
expense.

« Wassergate taught us only that

he did ‘not mean that Kim
Watterson’s exploits last term
during the Student Government
Board elections were an example of
the Germanic influence on Amer-
icanculture (“Wasser” is German
for water). Rather, the insightful
person was making an offsides
analogy of Watterson’s ﬁnaglings
with Jeff Miller’s transcripts to the

 Watergate scandal.

It is not really offsides, however,

Wassergate is,a spring rain, and
the analogy is ridiculous.

But in terms of other similarities
between the two “gates,” the
parallel is nearly perfect.

to be‘ an offsides analogy since
Nixon himself committed this act,
while in Wassergate--ironically
enough--the obstruction was car-
ried out by the investigating body,

Let Dorm VisitationPo|icy Stand I

In the past years the Board of
Trustees has made important
decisions concerning the student’s
lives despite it having insufficient
student representation. It has
come to our attention that our
current 24-hour guest visitation
policy has come under the scrutiny
of the Board of Trustees.

The administration formed a task
force whose charge was to examine
thecurrent 24-hour guest visitation
policy. This committee consists of

'-fa‘¢““1tY members. a resident

director, a resident assistant, and

two students. The group will make
a recommendation to Vice Chancel-
lors Freeman and Kimbo concern-
ing the visitation policy on Jan. 18.
On Jan. 22, Freeman and Kimbo
will make their recommendation to
the Board of Trustees, which will
decide if any revisions, possibly
reducing the 24-hour policy, will be
made. The most disturbing aspect
of this entire situation is the fact
that the students were not
informed. . The administration
probably would have kept the
entire matter a secret until the
decision was reached.

/

We feel that the 24-hour

visitation policy is satisfactory as, it i

stands. There is no need for’
revision, especially without the
students’ knowledge. If you wish
to voice your opposition, a petition
will be circulated by the RSA floor
representatives. This is your
chance to let the administration
know how you feel. "

Watterson (she is suspended from
all involvement in student activities
until March 1) only slapped the
wrists of her two accomplices, said
“No, no, bad boy”, and walked
away after putting the tapes of the
Wassergate hearing under lock, and
key. ' ' I
If justic is defined as equal
treatment,‘ then the other two
perpetrators of. Wassergate-_-

to Miller’s records, equally guilty
of violating the Buckley Amend-
ment--should have received equal
treatment. Watterson’s punish-
ment is severe in . that her
outstanding leadership abilities
were pruned right when they
should have blossomed, during her
junior year. Her two clerical
worker “friends,” conversely, are
still punching the same computer
keys and dialing the same
telephone. Justice was served
about as well in -Wassergate as it

was in Watergate, where Nixon .

was left off the hook._

With obstruction of justice, the
analogy ends--Wassergate went, off
in a worse direction. Though Nixon
was freed to head for the seclusion
of San Clemente, lessons were
learned from Watergate. Politic-
ians, journalists say, have become
more honest, and citizens more

opportunity to nip at the bud---I

continued‘ abuse of the registrar’s

’ office. Watterson’s ability to get at
‘ Miller_’s records was due to a’
‘friendship fostered between SGB

members and a registrar employee
last year. During the 1979
school year, favors like processing
cards for admittance to closed
classes without proper forms, and
other circumventions of regular
registration procedures, were car-
ried out for members of SGB. Per-
sons who began the set-up saw
nothing wrong with it (“With all I
did for this university, I deserve
something,” one SGB member told
me), though it eventually laid the
groundwork for Wassergate. And,
apparently, SGB members were
right about, not viewing their
benefits as illicit: no formal
admonishments were issued to
those SGB members. Without
that, and with the two employees

still functioning in their same.

pen again. j’

Pitt was at an even greater height

North Whips South in Senior Bowl

MOBILE, Ala.—All American
Marc Wilson of Brigham Young got
the biggest award, but Mark
Malone of Arizona State got
something more rewarding—re-

The two quarterbacks, taking
advantage of six turnovers and a
partially blocked 6-yard punt,
steered the North to the most
lopsided victory in Senior -Bowl
history Saturday, a 57-3 shelling of
the South.

The Yanks turned the seven
mistakes into six touchdowns and a
field goal, building a 20-0 lead
early in the second quarter that
virtually settled the issue.

Wilson, who won an automobile
for being the game's Most
Valuable Player, connected on 11 of
19 passes for,128 yards and three
touchdowns despite seeing limited
practice time because of a sore
arm.

Malone scored one touchdown '

and passed for another, rushing for
54 yards and throwing for another
125 to claim "the $1,.000 award
given the top offensive performer
on the North squad,

Malone. “l knew that llwould. I

intercepting a Jimmy Jordan pass.
He took it to the South 36, setting
up the first of three field goals by

“Today we were much more
aggressive than the last time we
played them,” said Colescott,
referring to a defeat earlier in the
season by Duke in the Big Four
Tournament. “I_think we were
scared to take the ball inside then.
We weren't tonight.”

Eddie Phillips scored 15 of his 23
points as Alabama rolled to a 41-20
halftime lead and went on to a
surprisingly easy victory over
Kentucky in Lexington. It was the
second straight upset of a ranked

team on the road for. Alabama,

which defeated LSU earlier in the
week.

At the beginning of the season

- Coach Rande Stottlemeyer and his

wrestling team were well aware of
the sort of year that may be in store
for them. There would be some
really good times and then their
was always that possibility of some
really bad times.

Now, after a month of competi-
tion the Panther grapplers are
looking forward to the arrival of
those positive outcomes on the
The Panthers were on the
road this past weekend where they
faced Lycoming and recorded a
30-18 win and‘ Bloomsburg State
College which ‘resulted in a
desimating 41-6 loss. Both these
matches came only four days after
the Panthers faced the number
three ranked team in the nation,
Oklahoma.

Looking at the Lycoming meet
the Panthers came away with six

individual winners in their respect- ’

ive weight classes. Opening thing
off for the Panthers was Glenn
Maxwell as he competitor in an
exhibition "match. Maxwell had

‘already won the match ofﬁcially-
_ due to the fact that the Lycoming

wrestler was overweight. Team-

. mates Billy Clark, Glenn Nacion,

and Jeff Gordon followed Maxwell

with decisions to put the Panthers
in a lead that they would never
relinquish.

Pitt was defeated in the next
three matches as Mike Toole was
pinned and Mario Mancini and
Wayne Lawrence lost by decision.
At 177 pounds Jeff Wilps was
winning his match 4-0 when his
opponent Jim Maurer was forced to
default the match because of a
dislocated elbow. Pat COIIIIOI‘ and
Steve_ “Smokey” Smocharski
rounded out the Panther lineup
with a loss and another victory
respectively.

“We were winning the meet
24-1_8 going into the heavyweight
match” said Stottlemeyer, “and
Lycoming thought they would
attempt to send someone in to
face Smokey. They pulled their
wrestler out, though, when they

saw that Smokey‘ was winning.” ’
' Overall we were pretty pleased

with the ‘performances putting
against Lycoming]? added Stottle-
Meyer. “Whether they won or lost
they all fought and scrapped their
way through the match and pulled
together as a tearn...it was a/total
team effort.” I

The services of some of Pitt’s
ﬁner wrestlers were quite notice-
able whenthe Panthers matched
upwith Bloomsburg a night later.

LSU Coach Missing in Crash

By The Associated Press

CAPE -CHARLES, Va.——The
Coast Guard has suspended the
search for wreckage of an airplane
carrying’Louisiana State football
Coach Robert “Bo” Rein, saying
the effort would be resumed only if
debris were ‘sighted.

Rein and pilot Louis Benscotter
were presumed dead after the
plane crashed in the Atlantic early
Friday following a wayward ﬂight
that began in Louisiana. .

The search was called off at
sunset Saturday “pending further

developments,” said Coast Guard
Lt. Gene Brooks.

LSU named Jerry Stovall as
football coach. Stoval, 38, was
assistant to -the LSU athletic
director. -He is a former all-pro
defensive back with the St. Louis
Cardinals, a LSU football All-
America and Heisman D Trophy
runner-up.

No new clues were‘ offered to
help explain the mysterious ﬂight
of the twin-engine Cessna 441 that
crashed 100 miles off Virginia,
1,000 miles from its destination.

The final score was a 41-6 loss with
the only points that Pitt recorded
coming from a forfeit at heavy-

» weight.

“Bloomsburg was an extremely
well balanced team, they, didn’t
have aweak spot up the line,” said
Stottlemeyer. Panther Pat Connor
was forced to pull out of his match
when he suffered from stressed
ribs. The problem does not appear
to be too serious and Connor should
have no trouble in returning to the
lineup. - v .

With the remainder of the
injured Panthers things are not so
positive. Ace 150-pounder Ed
Bredniak will not return to action
this season as he will retire as a
Panther wrestler due to torn
ligaments in his thumb. Stottle-
meyer sees Bredniak as a big loss
to the Pitt squad.

Puerto Rico is the land of the
sun, especially this time of year.
To prove that the temperatures are
in the 80s everyday, take a look at
the Pitt swimmers and their deep
dark tans; sure proof of beautiful
weather. - '

Granted, the weather may be
ravishing that is not why the men’s
and women’s swimming teams

"went to San Juan during the

Christmas Holiday.

They went to train. Practice time
was six to eight every morning and
six to eight every night. Does it
soun.‘ tough to get up a five in the
morning to swim through a two
hour practice ‘that begins with 200
sit-ups? .

“The practices were tougher
tha'n‘a-ny I have ever swam, but
what made them harder were the
hours of our training,” said Estelle
Grant, a freshman breaststroker.

“We really hate to see Ed
leaving because he’s such a
go-getter. He works so hard all the
time. We hope to be able to use his
knowledge in assisting the rest of ,
the team from a coaching aspect.”

Panthers Mike Bond and Jackie
Kline have been out of action
because of ‘ a torn ligament and
pneumonia respecitvely. Bond
may have a possibility of returning
in time to fact powerhouse Lehigh
on Saturday evening. If not then,
he should be back in the lineup by
next Wednesday when Pitt will
meet Millersville. Kline will start
to work out today after a layoff. He
will return»to the lineup as soon as
he is able. When he does return
though, he will ﬁnd Billy Clark at
126. Clark has been doing a very
good for the Panthers.

Finally, 158-pounder Tom Jones

The fact is that these practices
might have been too strenuous,
since upon returning to the
unpredictable -Pittsburgh weather,

nine out of 13 women were ill this ,

week with a virus. Linda

Frankenbach has tendinitus and
was unable to swim on Saturday.
Even with all these factors being
considered, the Pittwomens’ 80-51
loss against Princeton left no one
satisfied with the results.
-According to the swimmers,
Princeton has a tough team, but
with»Pitt at its best, chances are
that Pitt will get “even” at the

' meet that really counts—eastems
at Penn State in March.

“We will get them at the most

‘ important meet, when we're at our
best,” said Judy Klotz following
her swimming.

YOKOHAMA* Japan—T.he
passing of Kevin Scanlon of
Arkansas and the running of
Nebrasa’s I.M. Hipp led the West
to a 28-17 victory over the East in
the ﬁfth Japan Bowl football game
yesterday.

The game, played in rain, sleet

‘and snow, before 27,000 shivering
‘Japanese fans, saw the West team,

coached by Tony Mason of Arizona
and Lou Holtz of Arkansas, rally
from a 10-7 halftime deﬁcit.

The season’s first snow in the
Tokyo region turned the artiﬁcial
turf into a mushy skating gnk. The

East lost two interceptions" and a’

fumble while the West fumbled
eight times, losing three of them.
The East team, coached by Earle
Bruce of Ohio State and Jackie

in the second quarter when a West

A short time later, the West
'ec6vered a fumble by the East,
and on the first play from
scrimmage, Scanlon hurled a
41-yard touchdown bomb to Eman-

Fifteen seconds before the half,
the East went ahead 10-7 on a ﬁeld
goal by David Holsclaw of Iowa
after a fumble by West quarterback
Turk Schonert of Stanford.

The West seized the lead at 7:37
of the third quarter when Brian

three plays later, Scanlon hurled
his second touchdown pass of the
game, 14 yards to Junior Miller of

Don't Forget To Write

L Pittsburgh Has A New Wave Scene

Just Have To Look Real Hard

By RUDE GIRL

’ “Hey listen,'I’m from New York
and I know “punk” and I’ll tell you,
this isn't “punk;” in fact, I don’t
know what you’d call this stuff. ”

This was overheard in the
bathroom of the ‘Decade where The
Dark, one of a slew of _new bands

_ emerging in the area, were playing
recently. The speaker was a young
girl decked out in classic punk attire
- Sid Vicious tee shirt (a lovely
example of cashing in on a cash-in)
and one of those chopped off
hairdos that’ll one day find its way
into the Eva Gabor Wig Boutique ,
catalogue with the description:
“Model 00069 is authentic
‘punque’; each unit bled, spat and
stepped on by Eva herself..."
Anyway, this gal knew what it was
all about; after all, where she came
from things were more
sophisticated than the poor slobsin
Pittsburgh were expected to
understand. Well, needless to say,
us girls in the toilet were insulted.

And how ‘bout dem Dark, man? I
If they're not punk, what are they?
“New Wave?’-’ Sometimes the band
members .wear sunglasses and
scream and jump around and one of
the guitars is yellow and diamond
shaped like the kind The Cars and
Cheap Trick use but I dgn’t think
so. Labels for music are stupid
(although Be Bop was kinda cute),
and as you ‘may have heard, the
term “New Wave” was concocted

by promoters who realized that ,
“Punk” was a label that would not
be palatable to the mass market and

reconstructions for everyone. So,
“New Wave” is no different than
the labelon a Campbell Soup can;
Debby Harry and Chris Stein no
better than the Campbell Kids.

The point of all this is that
something is happening in Our
Towne (and has been for awhile) ‘
that is innovative and exciting and
worthy of attention. Young bands
like The Bible, The Cardboards,
Carsickness, The Dark, No Shelter, ‘
The Rave Ups, The Same, The '
Shakes, The Young Radishes and
others have been playing at all sorts
of clubs, beneﬁts, parties, /
campuses and basically any place
where the event wouldn’t be
interrupted by over-anxious’ police

- at ten or eleven o’clock. (Which is
another reason the punk/ violence
hype is bad; four squad cars and six
half-starved canines aren’t needed ’
to break up at small). I s »

So, if you decide to take a gande
at any new groups, resist the
temptation to immediately slap a
label on their music. In some cases
you might be giving them more
credit than'they deserve, but a few
bands think they have something to
say and should be listened to with
an open mind. In_ other words, just
make your own judgements.
Remember, this is the age of the

' consumer. And if the consumer

- doesn’t wise up soon to manipulate
marketing techniques, some very
clever profiteers are going to get
very rich at our expense. We have
the right to make our own choices .

Country Charlie Daniels

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

At 43 years of age you'd think the man
would want to slow down a bit and take it
easy. But after singing the national
anthem at the Pittsburgh-Miami playoff
game, rooting the Steelers on to victory
for four quarters, doing an interview at

'WDVE, then playing an hour-and-a-half

concert of high-powered, Southern-style

,;grock‘n’ roll before a packed house at the

‘=3

Civic Arena, Charlie Daniels still wasn't
ready to call it a day.

When informed he had to do another
radio interview before the night was out
and to catch a ﬂight to Indianapolis in the
morning, Charlie just gave one of his

"large, lopsided, country boy smiles and

said, “Well, it’s been an interesting day.
But I feel more alive when I'm doing
something all the time.

“And anyway, we (the band) love this
town,” Charlie added.
places in this country where the people
seem to feel a certain way about the
Charlie Daniels Band.’ Long Island is
one, St. Louis is one, Pittsburgh, Pa. is
one and there’s some other_ places, too.
But, I mean, it’s like a real special-type
category where people feel a little bit
above and beyond about the band. This is
one of those places. That’s why we love
‘coming here.” . ”

Evidently the feeling is mutual among
Pittsburgh rock fans. The Charlie Daniels

 Band completely sold out their second
Arena appearance in the last six months

and currently rank as the most popular
concert act in this city. Q

As full as his days are on the road,
however, Charlie admitted his life away
from the stage “would probably bore fhe
hell out of most people. ; ,

‘‘I'm a real simple person,“ he said.
“When I go home, I like to stay home.
That’s what I do. If I don’t get off the
farm, that’s O.K. with me. I could stay
there for two weeks and never move.
Wouldn’t bother me at all. p ”

“A lot of people,” he added, “couldn't
get into what I do, and there's a lot of
stuff other people.do that I couldn’t get
into. They couldn’t, for instance, get into
working ~on.the farm, driving nails all
day.” ‘ - ’

One thing about Charlie Daniels that a
lot of people do get inte, however, is his
music. It is a reﬂection of this “simple
person,” a large, soft-spoken man,
content with a rub of Skoal and a

mstyrofoam cup, overalls, a 10-g/allon hat,

 ' ‘Theatre Express  

By MARK HOLAN

Charles Ludlam and the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company
have become quite familiar to -~
Pittsburgh theatre-goers over the
past few years. Via the Floating
Theatre, audiences have enjoyed A
‘ ‘Ventriloquist’s Wife, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Camille’ ’
and most recently, the zany ‘
‘ ‘Bluebeard. ’ ' Beginning

\Thursday, audiences will have
‘another chance to enjoy the work of
Ludlam. This time, however, with a
new twist. ’

For its second production of the
79-80' season, Theatre Express will
premiere “Stage Blood,” one of
Ludlam’s earlier works, and

become the ﬁrst company to do a
work by Ludlam other than the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company.
For the actors at Theatre Express,
doing “Stage Blood” is both an
honor and a challenge.

“It's a big challenge." said Peter
Matthey, one of Theatre Express’s
newest members. “This is a very
tough play. It’s a play that’s not
even logical, there are a lot of blind
alleys. I’m not even sure what it all
means at this point. But it is an I
honor. I’m very excited about the

- whole thing.” I

and signs autograph after autograph for
his ‘fans of" all ages.

‘ "Above anything else to do with music, I

I'll take communicating with people,”
said Charlie after signing a Confederate
flag and posing for a photo with a local
policeman.” “And as far as getting
across to people is concerned, we have

different crowds in each place we play,
‘ but every night the people react like they

understand what we're talking about. The
things we're talking about are so damn
simple ‘anyway that anybody could

Although Caren Harder, General
Manager of-Theatre Express,’
insists that there “isn’t any big
mystery” about the company ‘
acquiring production rights for

‘ ‘ Stage Blood, ’ ’ several factors
helped bring it about. Theatre
Express’s respect for Ludlam’s
brand of.absurd humor, coupled
with the company,’s growing
reputation in New York, was one
reason. Another was the Leon Katz
connection.

Katz, director of the Floating
Theatre, was responsible for
bringing Theatre Express and
Ludlam together. In September,
when Ludlam was in town with
“Bluebeard, " Katz arranged a
post-performance meeting of\the
two groups. .

‘ ‘I've been talking to him
(Ludlam) about his plays,” related
Katz. “It’s only recently that he's
begun to think of them asplays
independently of his own
company’s production of them.
What I've been suggesting to him is
that he get‘ them published. '

“So thinking in that vein, when
the Theatre Express people spoke

about wanting to do Ludlam, it
suddenly seemed to him that it was
perfectly possible to have one of his

plays done by another company _ , 

 .‘\ ,_

 

I

understand "them. I want_everybody to
understand them.” ’ '

Understanding Charlie Daniels’ music
is a little easier to do than understanding
the reason behind hisrecent surge in
popularity, even for Charlie.

I “I don’t feel like no big deal,” Charlie

. said. “It’s a little out of my grasp to think

of things in that scope (a huge success).

V I just see us as being a damn good band,

and that’s not an iota of braggadocio.

1 That’s fact.”

However, as" far as Pittsburgh. is
concerned, Charlie pointed to some
deﬁnite reasons why his breed of

independently of his own.‘ That’s
just beginning now; his thinking of
himself as a playwright as much as
head of a company and doing work
that only ﬁts his own company."
Since thelate 1960s, Ludlam and
his company have worked closely
together to develop the 4‘
relationships and style necessary to
perform his plays. For Theatre
L Express, a talented but very new
company, this is perhaps the most
difﬁcult obstacle to overcome in
doing “Stage Blood.”
“We're not anensemble like his
- company,” explained Matthey.
“These are-people who have
worked together, they know each
other very well and there is a lot of
give and take. Many of us are still
strangers to one another. This is
something we're working on now:
the give and take, reacting to one '

Behind The Music I

Southern rock has taken over the hearts of

a once heavy metal dominated city._i

“Pittsburgh's a working-class town“:

that's the way I look at it," he says. '

“There’s a lot of people here who...(are) _
. salaried; they're working people. They

work 40.hours a week, or 45, or 30 or 38 or
whatever they can get.
working people. They get up every

morning and the wife cooks breakfast for ,
them and they ride on down the road to A

their job. And that's the kind of family,
even ancestry, that I— came from. It's ,a
working class of people, and that's where
my heart's at." '

Charlie's work certainly has paid off ‘for
him in many ways, especially monetarily.
But this has only served to solidify
Charlie’s working man's philosophy
toward life. _‘

“I enjoy life an awful lot. I enjoy every
day of it. If I don't let the devil trick me
into getting my mind off down the wrong
path, then I can have a pretty peaceful
day. I try not to offend anybody, because

I don’t like to be offended. I treat other _

people like I'd want them to treat me. It’s
made me a happy person. And that's the

But they're ‘

ultimate thing in my life——to be a happy -

person.”

Charlie paused for a moment to reflect,
somewhere along the million miles, then
continued.

“I'll tell you one thing I've learned in

- 43 years of being on the Earth. And, I -

don't want you to get me wrong, I love to
make money, Ilove awards, and sold-out
halls. I enjoy all those gold and platinum
records, and that sort of thing. But if
money and awards are the only things a
man has to show for a lifetime of work,
it_’s a pretty empty, narrow life. I think
when you succumb to nothing but a proﬁt
motive, then you start getting led away

‘from the people you're depending on "I
. doing business with. And when you lose “

sight of the people you're doing business

With. then you lose sight of your’

business."
And when the business is ﬁnished,

the end of its ‘road, how does Charlie want
people topremember what the band has

.done?

“I want people to remember us for the
hit records we had and all the concerts we
had and everything (else). But the main
thing I want people to remember us for is
our music, ‘cause in the end that’s all any
of us will really leave behind."

another and finding those moments
where we can develop a sense of ‘
community, a sense of company. ”

‘ ‘Stage Blood" is about a road
company of actors. On tour with
Shakespeare's “Hamlet,” the
troupefinds itself without an
Ophelia. Actual dialogue and
scenes from “Hamlet" are used in ‘
“Stage Blood” which often become
interwoven with Ludlam’s complex
plot twists.

“It’s like a play within a play, ”
noted Janet Reed who plays the
stand-in Ophelia. “There are many
different styles and concepts within p
it. You're just constantly switching
gears, in mid-stream.” .

Ludlam is expected to attend one
of Theatre Express’s productions
during the play’s run. He’s
presently touring Canada, ironically.

to close its doors indeﬁnitely
because of problems with the
Comprehensive Employee Training
Act program, the Lab’s primary
funding agent, which caused near
banlfruptcy. A complete season of
ﬁve plays by the Lab’s resident
playwright Leon Katz, including
“The Possessed,” had been
scheduled for the 1979-80 season.

In early October, the Playhouse
announced that Roysteon would
become associate director and that

classic novel. In 1964, while
teaching and directing at Stanford,
Katz did an adaptation of “The
Possessed” for the stage based on
the novel and an earlier adaptation
by Albert Camus. Since then he
has revised the script, placing more
emphasis on the novel than on
Camus’ adaptation.

For the production, Royston has
assembled what amounts to an
all-star cast of 27 actors and
actresses. Included are former Lab

Theatre regulars Bingo O’Malley,
David Crawford, Caryl Opshinsky,
Phil Thomson and Kate Royston.
Also included are Kevin Cotter, a

“It’s just quality people from the
top to‘ the bottom.”

“Sometimes you need a crisis to
join a large group of people
together. If this was in the middle
of the season, at the Lab Theatre,
I'm not sure that the energy would
be there, and I’m not sure that
some of the people in the cast would
be as enthusiastic about spending
so much time for such a demanding
production.’ " _

‘ ‘The Possessed” is indeed a
demanding production. The play
has four acts and approximately 30
scenes. Originally ﬁve hours long,

Royston and Katz have cut the

'This‘Production Will Have A Lot To Do, With  

Decision Regarding Future Work Here’

 

as a Lab production (SHOWCASE,

No. 13, Oct. 10, 1979). The

arrangement came about after two
‘ months of negotiations between

’  Royston and Playhouse director

Mark Lewis. _

'-‘The Lab Theatre is still its own
entity," explained Royston. “We
are simply staging ‘ ‘The
Possessed’ ’ at the.Playhouse like
other groups that work out of here
(Pittsburgh Dance Council, for
example). What makesit unique is

: that I'm also on the staff.”

Despite Royston’s position at the
Playhouse and overwhelming
advance ticket sales, there is no '
guarantee that the Lab Theatre will

[have future productions at the
Playhouse. Royston referes to the
production of “The Possessed” as a
“tuming point. ’ ’

“This production will have a lot
to do with a decision regarding
future work here. I would think that
within a month after this production
closes some serious decisions are
going to have to be made. The
success of this production will have
a lot to do with it," said Royston.

Regardless of the eventual
outcome, Royston maintains a
personal commitment to doing
Katz’s plays.

“I have a personal commitment
that the plays that were announced
last summer, we will do. We're
getting this one mounted here, but
it may take us two years to do our

year's worth of plays. The commit-
ment is that they will be produced
one way or another,” emphasize
the director. _ ’

“I'm very excited andpleased."
said Katz, who besides being the
Lab’s resident playwright is also a
professor of speech and theatre arts
at Pitt and director of the Floating
Theatre. “Especially in
that...(even though) the Lab
Theatre shut down in its former

, location, Bill (Royston) remained
. committed to the idea of doing
. plays. I value that committment."

The Lab’s production of “The
Possessed” is not Katz’s first-
adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's

former Merrill Fellow in Acting at
Pitt, and Pitt graduate students in
theatre Gary Rose and Bill Castle.

‘ ‘It’s the best cast I've ever
assembled for the Lab Theatre and I
think’ it's one of the best casts ever
put togethenfor a production in
Pittsburgh,” proclaimed Royston.

will it be demanding for the cast,
but also for the audience.

‘ ‘It challenges an audience, ”

noted Roygton. “.It’s not the kind of _ ,

script where you can just sit ‘back
and relax. - You have to work to get
it, but it's will worththe effort.” '

  

~ According to_both Royston and
Jatz, the Playhouse’s Theatre
Downstairs will be helpful in
bringing the intensity of “The
Possessed” closer to the audience.
The subterranean, black-box space
is very suitable to the theme of the
play. Royston has divided the stage
area into 11 different sets. '
“It’s chaos when you walk in.

You see couches and chairs and
tables; there’s no order to anything
and it looks very motley. But when

.the house lights go out and the

stage lights come’ on, allof a
sudden there’s a very structured
environment. I did that to help
reﬂect Dostoevsky, ’ ’ “explained
Royston, referring to the many
seemingly unrelated subplots that

. run through the play and are ﬁnally

brought together in the fourth act.
“The Possessed” is about a man,
Stavrogin, who believes he is
possessed by the devil. It is a story
ﬁlled with manipulation and
terrorism. Along with Katz’s
intense script, Royston’s talented
cast and ﬁne sets, an original ‘
musical score has been composed
by Michele Debushie and recorded
by 15 members of the

Going in «Style .

Directed by Martin Brest

’ “Going in‘ Style,” directed by Martin

Brest, is a ﬁlm that examines the problem

of being old in America.
.The story revolves around three old
m'en»close- to their seventies: Joe (George

I ’ Baurns), Al (Art Carney) and Willie (Lee

Strasberg). Burns is the leader—intro-
spective, intelligent and persuasive.

" Carney, easygoingand usually happy, is

a needed contrast to Strasberg’s

I complacent and disinterested character.
., _ i In the ﬁrst scene of the film we see the .
, ‘three men sitting on a park bench. A

little boy approaches themrand stares at

7 Burns, occasionally glancing at the

others. Unable to deal with the boy,
Burns scares him away—there is some

- kind of gap between our young and old

here.

The problem of older citizens having
enough money to live is what starts the
main action in this ﬁlm. Even though the
three men live together and’ pool social

a security checks, there is still only enough

money to barely exist. Disgusted with the
way things are going and the prospects
for the future, Burns persuades Carney
and Strasberg into helping him rob a
bank. Burns puts it simply and forcefully
when he says they really have nothing to

and when they get out they will have their
monthly checks waiting for them. And if

' they do not ‘get caught, they will have it

made with all themoney. ‘

Itis a sad statement, “Nothing to lose
either way,” but true. So they opt for the
robbery, and the fact that they made the
decision to do something gives them
some sense of life and some control of
their fate.

Director Brest is imaginative in his
“ﬁlm language’ ’ throughout the ﬁlm. He
is constantly interpreting his characters’

feelings through other action in the same A
. shot or a following shot. In a scene where

the three men are taking the subway into

Manhattan to check out some banks,
Brest has three little boys running and

I laughing through the subway cars. This
" time the men smile and laugh—they feel

like boys now.

Later, as the men are fumbling with the
guns that they will use to rob,the bank,
Brest cuts to a shot of little boys playing
“bang bang, shoot ’em up,” an
appropriate simile. But probably the
most penetrating scene, at least
symbolically, is after a successful
robbery. Theyare sitting on the usual
park bench and they watch a group of
little boys playing in the park ‘fountain.
There is laughing, jumping and/joyful
banter, and, at least for this moment, the
men feelthe same way. But the fountain
is in the foreground and the men are in
the background—they may watch, but the
fountain is not for them; it is beyond their
reach. And as the children play, Willie

When we get to the cemetery where
Willie is to be buried Brest’s “mise-en-
scene” is perfect. He uses a telephoto
lens as the camera surveys the cemetery,
giving it a cramped, overcrowded look. It
is a sad, almost comic shot.

The rest of the ﬁlm follows Burns and

Carney as they ﬁgure out ways to spend in
their money and have a good time. Their

antics are hilarious. _

All of the acting is excellent, although
there is some trouble with Strasberg’s
Willie. The character does not seem fully
developed. Whether it is the fault of the
writer’s lack of material for Strasberg
(Brest co-wrote the script) or Strasberg
himself is not clear. /

Carney’s portrayal of Al, the light-
hearted, easy going counterpart to Burn’s
more serious character, is great. But
probably the most exceptional perfor-
mance in the ﬁlm is Burns as Joe. Here is

not the Burns of “Oh God!” and “The
Sunshine Boys,” in which he played roles

A closer to his true self. Instead, here is a

serious actor dealing with a complicated
character and doing it well. When in the
middle of the night Burns awakes, sitting
up and then looking into the darkness, we
can actually see him think. Everything
Burns does is in the vein of his
character—facial expressions, physical

_ movements and speaking—he, conveys

his character ﬂawlessly.

The Electric Horseman
Directed by Sydney Pollack

There is much to be said aboutthe
motion pictures of the 1970s. Many
American ﬁlms of the last decade have
made admirable and necessary state-
ments on present culture and widely-held
attitudes. in our society. Representative
of these sentiments are “Kramer vs.
Kramer,” “The Deer Hunter,” and “The
China Syndrome.” ‘Additionally there
were important movies dealing with the
portrayal of strong women's roles over
the past ten years: “Julia” and “An
Unmarried Woman.”

In a period when directors are, for the
most part, staying away from making
films that have much to do with

traditional storylines and their neat happy '

endings, it is refreshing to see a high-
powered cast like the one that worked in
“The Electric Horseman” stick their
necks out on a project that “fails”’ to
brag the special effects or epic drama
criteria that has come to be synonymous
with “blockbuster” for the majority of
America’s movie-going public.

“The Electric Horseman” is a good
movie. It doesn't merit its strength in
heavy drama, topical subject, or special
effects. »It_ is “electric” because .of the
touching and warm relationship between

Parade Of Space

By THOMAS PALMER

Star Trek—The Motion Picture
Directed by Robert Wise

,,\,.Director Robert Wise and producer
Gene Rodenberry have followed the lines
of all‘ good businessmen: amass as much
money as possible with as little effort as
possible. Riding on the strength of the
frenzied following of the hit television
show, “Star Trek——The Motion Picture”
plays like an orchestrated tour of the
cosmos—a very 4 professional, ﬂashy,
multi-million-dollar postcard from the
outer space of the imagination.
Somewhere, someone (probably Rod-

enberry) feels that a human adventure
“Star Trek—The .-

was just beginning.
-Motion Picture” tried to conceive one but
seems to have missed. Possibly due to
hurried production, or too many
cinematic tricks and not enough vehicles
for them, or because Rodenberry trie_d to
recapture that early television magic and
both condense and glorify it in two hours.
What ultimately turned out was a_ story

that would have worked nicely on TV,
with time for commercials and station
breaks.

But, the return of the legendary “Star
Trek” was destined to take shape in the
cinemas. And ﬁlling in these long narra-
t_ive gaps are a panorama of close-ups of
Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard
Nimoy), Decker (Stephen Collins), McCoy
(DeForest Kelly), and the rest of the
original crew. The majority of these
dedicated space cadets can find nothing
better to do than stand around with terse
looks’ on their faces. The most
enlightening change in. the totally
revamped USS Enterprise is the addition
of Lt. Ilia (Persis Khambatta). This thrill

. quickly fades as she informs the captain

early about her oath of celibacy.

When we are .not watching these
ulcer-forming’ grimaces and furrowed
brows, we are staring out the viewing
screen with Director Wise, who takes us
through the gaseous bowels of an alien
force with so much unfathomable energy
that we must sit and gape along with the

_rest of the crew.of the Enterprise.

Airevamped USS_Enterprise

 

A multi—million dollar postcard from the outer space of the imagination.’

Gone are the humanoid: adversaries,
the universal philosophies, the interga-
lactic cultural shocks we shared with Kirk
and his crew episode after episode on TV.

.Instead,: we are swamped with astro-

physics and futuristic blueprinting—a
bridge computer system authentic and
detailed down to the last button. Roden-
berry and Wise wanted that detail, so
much that they neglected giving the
non-Trekkies a plausible, interesting
story.

With the completion of his $40 million
introduction, perhaps Rodenberry can

now concentrate on adding a plot to‘
complement his elaborate set in the
inevitable sequels. Once again we have
been put in the same situation by the
sci-ﬁ distributors, that group who insists
on putting these futuristic space titans
face to face with something ultimately
incomprehensible, but always a. key to
existence. That, of course, is nestled
somewhere in the galaxy.

Fortunately for those involved with
“Star Trek——The Motion Picture," their
key is changing hands at box offices in
theatres all over the country.

°   Bette Midler Powerful In All Acts Of Film uh

By MARK HOLAN

The Rose _
Directed by Mark Rydell

When Gertrude Stein wrote “a rose is a
rose is a rose....” she failed to anticipate
Bette Midler as the lead in Twentieth
Century-Fox’s holiday release “The
Rose.”g In her film "debut Midler
single-handedly transforms a mediocore
script into what was one of the better
entries of the traditional Christmastime
movie blitz. Not only does Midler belt out
a dozen tunes, but she also reveals a
surprising ability to be dynamic in front of
the camera, as well as in front of live"
concert audiences.

The ﬁlm’s story line, aself-destructive"

lady of rock’n’roll in search of love and-a
vacation while on tour in 1969, coupled
with Midler’s psychedelic garb and wild,
frizzy hair, have led many movie-goers to

. believe that “The Rose” is a cinema

bibliography of the late Janis Joplin. This

745 untrue. Although this ﬁlm is a re-write

of a ten-year old script titled “Pear ,”
which was exclusively about Joplin, “The
Rose” is as much the late Jim Morrison’s

story as it is Joplin’s. It is a composite of ‘
several performers, including Midler

3‘.

Bette Midler as O Fiose:

  
   

. In the murk of booze and drugs, the sad tears of an insecurfawoman

herself. 4

For years, Midler had a tumultuous
relation with her now ex-manager Aaron
Russo. ' Likewise, in the ﬁlm, Rose and
her manager Rudge (Alan 'Bates) are
constantly at each other throats. Yet
underneath the tension there is respect, if

not even a little love. In one scene Rose
shows-up late for a recording session and
is promptly scolded by Rudge. When
Dyer (Frederic Forrest) Rose's lover, tries
to defend her, she promptly sticks-up for

the genius of her manager and denounces
Dyer as a “piece of meat.”

This dichotomy in Rose's relationship
with Rudgereﬂects the basic persona of
Midler’_s character. Most- often, Rose
comes across as a nasty, drunken bitch
and Midler is superb ’ at delivering
scorching one-liners. For example: When
a short order cook at an all-night diner
tells Rose and Dyer that “We don’t serve
hippies,” she responds slowly, but with a
sharp tongue, “Well that's alright“cause
we don’t eat ’em.” Similarly, she rebuffs
one patron by telling him that if his tool is
as small as his brain, he's in a lot of
trouble.

But these are only the thorns of the
Rose. She has a softer, almost child-like
side too. “Can we go steady, can we, can
we” she implores Dyer like a high school
girl after their initial love making. More
dramatically, in the murk of booze and
drugs, there are the sad tears of an
insecure woman which dissolve her tough
exterior and smudge her mascara.

Although “The Rose” is her ﬁlm

debut, Bette Midler is no stranger to the’

musical stage or to vinyl.- Three separate
concerts. were staged in California for
scenes in the movie. Two shows were
held indoors in Los Angeles at the
Embassy Auditorium and the Wiltern
Theatre. The Third concert, held
outdoors for the ﬁlm’s climatic home-
coming concert, was at the Long Beach-
Veterans Memorial Stadium.

Several thousand fans paid to become
extras in these concert scenes.

Considering the powerful footage of
Midler onstage in “The Rose,” its easy to
see why. Not normally a rock singer,
Midler’s moves and voice easily lend
themselves to the genre. 3

The Rose Band is comprised of eight
musicians from a diverse background that
ranges from Alice Cooper to Cher. They
back Midler on the movie and on the
soundtrack album‘ which includes
“Whose Side Are You On,” “Midnight
In Memphis,” “Sold My Soul To Rock
N’Roll,” “Keep On Rockin’ ” and “Love
Me With A Feeling.”

Although all these tunes are nicely
arranged and sung with brilliant intensity
by Midler, two are absolute standouts.

Directed by Steven Spielberg a

Universal Pictures is advertising this as
a “comedy spectacular," and with good
reason. Director Steven Spielberg has
produced a ﬁlm that “documents” the
“Japanese invasion" of Los Angeles that

, never happened.

In the ﬁlm, the city is gearing up for the
expected invasion. The appearance of a

Toshiro Mifune, doesn’t exactly calm the
locals’ fears—nor does a dogﬁght in
Hollywood between a crazed airplane
pilot (John Belushi) and a girl-crazy
general’s aide (Tim Matheson). This is
compounded by Sgt. Tree (Dan Aykroyd),
who hijacks a tank to try to stop a rioting
group of Marines, Army men and sailors.

Sound confusing? That's mainly
because it is. But that’s what helps to
make “1941” so interesting—at any
given time there are a half-dozen

‘sub-plots, and Spielberg keeps the

audience’s interests by switching from
scene to scene.

The one thing that will disappoint some

And there is a general criticism of the
ﬁlm it must be in regards to the plot.
Spielberg is apparently more concerned
with action and impressive footage than
tying up the many loose ends that present
themselves at the ﬁlm’s conclusion.

But, even this‘ aside, Spielberg has
done a good job. He had already shown
what he could ‘do with spectacle and
special effects in “Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,T’ and now has created
scenes that work with clockwork
precision. The choreography of this ﬁlm
is perfect—like a Rube Goldberg
drawing, ridiculous events combine to
give a predictable result. This movie
succeeds because it features the one
element still funny in comedy—slapstick.
The result is quick-paced, funny material
that keeps the audience alert throughout.

Effects Survive ‘The Black   ilole’

By GEORGE SHANER

The Black Hole
Directed by Gary Nelson

Most science ﬁction ﬁlms of the past few
years have had two things in common:
extra ﬁne special effects and pedestrian
scripts.
tried to’ be profound; “Star Trek—The
Motion Picture” retreads the television
show; “Alien” tried to make you jump;
and “Star Wars” was just out for a good
time. All these ﬁlms truly dazzled the
eye, though little substance remained
once the lights cleared.

“The Black Hole” is the classic.

. example of what could have been an

excellent ﬁlm had half the thought spent
on the special effects been spent on the
screen play. ' -

“The Black Hole” concerns the
discovery of the lost starship Cygnus on

M the edge of a black hole. The Cygnus has

been lost for some 20 years, and all that is
left of the crew is a fascist-like army of
robots led by the solehuman aboard, Dr.‘
Ernest Reinhart (played by Maximillian
Schell). From there, the‘ plot describes

: the‘escape of the discovery party from

Schell and their encounter with the black
hole. ’ ‘

The big flaw in this ﬁlm is the
stereotypid casting given the actors.
Joseph Bottoms and Robert Forster are

Sure,‘ “Close ~ Encounters...” .

stuck with playing silly space-going
cowboy roles. On the other hand,
Anthony Perkins and Yvette Mimieux are
given parts as idiot savant scientists who
are so bent on getting information that
they are numb to their own self-preserva-
tion until it’s almost too late.

Only Schell as the obsessive Dr.
Reinhart and Ernest Borgnine as an
alternately cocky and cold-blooded
journalist add any human dimension to .
the ﬁlm. The other characters» just
bounce: off the limits delineated by
Schell’s and Borgnine’s actions and
inspire little sense of caring in- the
audience. , ,

As mentioned before,_ the‘ dialogue
scripted for the movie is poor and leaves
the actors almost _ tota_lly shackled.
Granted, this movie was intended for the
widest audience possible, but that’s no

excuse to present the viewers with such _
simplistic renderings in the name of mass 9

appeal. The most vapid soap opera has ‘
better dialogue. ‘

In the" end, the desire‘ to present ,a
spectacle has subverted the ability to tell
a story". It would be nice if the ﬁlmmakers
of the world would get“ on with the art of
telling stories that use special effects as a
way to get the point across, not as a
substitute for plot. Until then, all we’re
going to get_ from science ﬁction on the
screen is half-baked melodrama.

be honest without hitting you over the

Leo Quoq, the squiggly-looking prot'ag-

Tantrum, is ensnarled in every con-
ceivable trap. The nagging wife trap. The
‘irresponsible kids trap. The success and
the “I’m getting older” traps. Leo lumps
them all together, ﬁgures the root of his

McKuen’s WeTouch TheSky' Doesn't Reach VeryFar 

‘Rod McKuen

We Touch the Sky

Simon and Schuster

‘By KAREN METZINGER

“We Touch the Sky” is Rod McKuen’s
latest contribution to the world of
“poetry,” and fortunately, that world is a

‘ large one. Hopefully, one a book can get

lost in, or, at the very least, passed by, as

this one should.

At its best, “We Touch the Sky” is like
any greeting card: polite and general. At

that—“the disability you allege is irrele-
vant to your wife's legal status, little
boy.” Leo is trapped once again.

His parents won’t help, either. Leo
knocks on their door to get diapered and
pampered, only to be told to hit the road;
mom and dad have had enough.

Other persons who have willed them-
selves down to age two, Leo ﬁnds, have
ironically taken on the "responsibility of
retaliating against the social order that
has continually fed them ‘duties, respon-
sibilities and guilt trips. The two-year-
olds rally in an abandoned building, and
when Leo expresses his disdain for them
(an Archie bunker-type raspberry), they
label him a traitor. - '

And so on, as Leo trips around the sitf
and the world and ﬁnds either no one
wants him, or everyone wants him to
shape up and to shoulder his burdens
despite his age.

It’s a salient point Feiffer is making,
that of the double bind society gets us
into (or where we get ourselves) where
it's impossible to cut our slice of the cake
without ﬁrst reluctantly sharpening’the
knife. Perhaps only Feiffer, with his
wonderful talent with‘ ink, can make
squiggly lines express so much about the
frustration, stupidity, bureaucracy and

The collection is full of vapid verse. For -

  Blackmore And Rainbow
Storm Pittsburgh Again

By MARK MONAHAN

Ralnbowl Gamma Concert Review

Stanley Theater
December 13, 1979

Veteran British_ rock guitarist Ritchie
Blackmore may not be the most popular
rock star in the world; but one thing's for
sure—it’s never boring once he hits a
stage.

In town in mid-December with a new
line-up for Rainbow, his post Deep Purple
band, Blackmore, dressed in ominous
black, was his usual brilliant but

_ dangerous self. _

In an age where most rock musicians
are bending and adapting their musical
presentation toward commercially proﬁt-
able MOR tastes, Blackmore remains a
tower of integrity, being his own man,
playing his own dramatic and intense
brand of steamroller music.

What makes Blackmore so entertaining
is _his unpredictability. When watching
him perfprm, one sees a proﬁcient,
primarily heavy metal guitarist who has

his roots buried deep in blues rock, with
strains of classical arrangements thrown
in. He retains a unique ability to
improvise barrages of moody, spaced out
guitar lines of his own personal emotion.

Besides being a guitar whiz, Blackmore
commands attention from his wild ﬁts of
onstage rage. -

In past Pittsburgh visits he has, in the
process of performing, punched out
people onstage, kicked security guards in
the head, given crowds the ﬁnger and
smashed his guitar to pieces.

While some guitarists pound their axes
as frilly stage gimmicks and sliowboating,
Blackmore sadistically beats his like a
man possessed, seeming to crave the en-
joyment of watching the wood ﬂy. With
Blackmore, these tactics aren’t show. It’s
the real thing.

The latest version of Rainbow is _

unquestionably Blackmore’s best band
since leaving Deep Purple and starting
his own group back in 1975.

Only drum wizard Cozy Powell,
certainly one of rock's elite on that
instrument, remains ‘from the old

 

 

wouldnever admit it, Savoy Brown, led
by Kim Simmons, was the best band of
the evening. Although the group was
without much of its own equipment, (due
to a broken down truck somewhere
between Detroit andthe Stanley) Savoy
Brown rocked in style.' '

_ “We play rock and roll and the blues,”
announced Simmons. - “Not any of that
1970s bullshit.”

Simmon’s expletive about music in the '

’70s"applied nicely to Magister Ludi.
Although MC Jim DiCeasear of WYDD
tried desperately to get the packed house
to support the band, it was “no-go from
the well-liquored crowd. “The band was
on the infamous rock star trip and it
showed through terribly. , After three
mediocre tunes, the band waspcalled off
stage as it began its fourth number.

Savoy Brown, however, was well
appreciated. On songs like “Rock And
Roll Star” and “That’s What It’s All
About” thetrio proved that up-to-date hit
singles aren’t necessary to perform well
in concert. The band did four tunes and
one encore; a medley of various blues
songs.

The highlight of Savoy Brown’s' unfor-
tunately short set was Simmons steel
guitar work a la Heineken. Proclaiming
that he wanted to “get rid of some frus-
trations,” Simmons slid the neck of the
beer bottle down the neck of his guitar,
then proceeded to beat the hell out of his
instrument’s bridge with the bottom ‘of
the bottle. Imported brewlspewled out
over. the front two rows of_ people who,

like the rest of the crowd, found’ Simmons  he. ~”9,wd. its , .“.‘«‘:’-;'."“-Y-3‘ " .

  

antics very exciting.

And speaking of beer, next up was Roy
Buchanon. Although he didn’t drink as
much onstage as he did-last February,
there was still a healthy supply of Miller’;
placed at Buchanon’s amp.

There must be something about
Buchanon that this concert-goer has
. failed to get synced with twice in the past
year. Granted, Buchanon is one of the
‘ ﬁnest blues «guitarists around. Yet his
solid appearance, broken only by ‘an
“ occasional leer at the front row of
fanatical worshippers, makes his concerts
only slightly more exciting than the act of
putting one of his albums down on a turn
table.

Buchanon’s tradition tribute to his
“favorite’ guitarist” Jimi Hendrix, a
medley of several songs incldding “Hey
Joe,” “Foxy Lady” and “Red House,”
was very sloppy. Only Buchanon’s voice
drifted off further into space than his
guitar work Oh “Hey Joe.” After the
medley, the culmination of a very short
set, Buchanon and his band of studio

musicians were ﬁnished. They returned -

after a long wait for one encore.

There were good points ‘of course.
“Secret Love,” an instrumental, was ﬁne
proof of Buchano’n’s virtuosity. “Please
Don’t Turn Me Away” was-also good.

No doubt, the aging‘, «overweight
guitarist will be around soon to pick the
pockets of Pittsburgh’s Roy Buchanon

Tantrum/ Eddie and The Otters
The Decade
January 10, 1980

By scorr MOWRY

I

The Decade opened its 1980 concert
schedule when Midwest rockers Tantrum
‘visited Pittsburgh last Thursday night,
ﬂarking the 29th Danny Kresky-produc-
ed show.

This Chicago-based group brought with
them a unique blend of styles—part

, heavy metal, part harmony and melody,

and a little bit of cheesecake for good
measure.

Fronted by a trio of stunning female

vocalists—you guessed it, a blonde, a ,

brunette and a redhead—Tantrum also
featured four male backup players on
guitar, bass, keyboards and drums.

Tantrum’s performance consisted of 12
hard rock numbers culled from two
albums. The girls did all the singing, and
the boys handled all. the playing. This
lineup, for all its uniqueness, individual-
ity and obvious excitement, often
presented problems. '

Trading off lead vocals and Occasional .

solos, singers Barb Erber, Pam Bradely
and Sandy Cauﬁeld never seemed to
uphold their positions with any clarity or
distinctiveness. Instead, their voices

were often ‘buried by the barrage of »

instruments behind them or wielded

together in one big mass, sounding rather
like backup. vocalists than lead. What the
girls lacked vocally they more than made

' up in physical appeal, especially Carly

Simon look-alike Pam Bradley. However,
that is not at question here.

Tantrum’s players were tight and
accomplished but too many times
unoriginal in their approach. Guitarist
Ray Sapka, although ﬂashy, offered
nothing new, and keyboardist Phil
Balsano was_ competent but lacked
excitement. However, bassmanv Bill

Snyiar and drummer Vern Wennerstrom
displayed more than typical ﬁnesse when
they soloed between songs and provided
some of the more memorable musical
highlights of the evening.

The high pitch and the heavy metal
seemed to fuse together best near the end
of Tantrum’s set “How Long,” “Search-
in’ For A Reason” and “Rather Be
Rockin”’ ﬁnally demonstrated some of
the potential of this unique group.

Unfortunately this Thursday night, the
Decade crowd did not invite the group

erstrom, Phil Balsano, '

back for an encore, and Tantrum left
barely an hour after their show had
begun.

The On-again, off-again Eddie and The
Otters, an ever-improving band, provided
the most pleasant music of the evening
with renditions of “Grand Larceny,”
“Gloria” and “Louie, Louie.”

As for Tantrum, its idea of fronting a

hard rock band with three vocalists (male .

or female) is not a bad one.
Unfortunately for Tantrum, relying ‘on
ﬂash obscured its virtues; '

Dalglish, Larsen, Bogan And Armstrongzs   TrueFo|k

By GEORGE SHANER

Malcolm Dalglish & Grey Larsen

"C  Bogan & Armstrong

Carnegie Lecture Hall *
January 11, 1980

Over the past twenty years or so,
American folk music has had a somewhat
checkered history. Folk was the
avant-garde of American pop at the start
of the 60s; it fertilized rock via bands like
Bob Dylan, the Byrds and the Mamas and
Papas, and it has been dragged into
vapidity by the worst excesses of the
singer-songwriter movement of the late
605/ early 70s. Over this time, folk
became something of a symbol at times,

-and the point of making enjoyable music

point that, apparently, has not been

forgotten among the people at Callipe I

House, one of Pittsburgh’s main
iorganizersof folk performances. The
proof is in last Friday's concert by
Dalglish & Larsen and Bogan &
Armstrong at Carnegie Lecture,Hall.

Malcolm Dalglish and Grey Larsen are
complete musicians—they sing, write,
are scholars, and make many of their own
instruments. ‘

It was obvious by the crowd reaction
that these men were local favorites, and
they returned the favor by maintaining

 perfect humor throughout their set; be it

' Armstrong differ, though, from revival-

Straw” or in the high level of musical

interaction attained in their renditions

of Irish dance music. ,
That Dalglish & Larsen are in no way

‘ lacking in ‘passion was brought home by

the refrain of their encore, “Early In The
Morning”: “I’m going upriver before
long/I know you’re going to. miss me
when I am gone/But-when a man loves a
woman, God only knows/can’t stand on

the swagger got to bottle up and go.”'

This sort of sentiment is what so many
artists want to accomplish, but never pull
off.

Ted Bogan and Howard Armstrong
represent a different tradition than

«Dalglish & Larsen, and they, too, were

well received by the audience. These
black musicians play what use to be the
pop music of 50 years ago: early jazz,
Where Bogan and

ists like Leon Redbone is that they are
probably the lastgoriginal practitioners
left today. In any case, they are good
players and exceedingly amusing show-
men, particularly when Bogan plays
canny straight man to Armstrong’s
outrageous stories. .

‘. As might be gathered, Bogan and

Armstrong are anything but dry in their
down-to-earth approach to performing
and have to be‘ seen to be appreciated. Of
most importance, though, is that they
remind one of the bittersweet humor that
stands behind the blues, which is some-
times lost in the electriﬁed swagger that

sparkling debut albums, which ardently
aim at a pop-that-rocks rejuvenation.
Their live performances, however, were a

' study in contrast.

20/20, although armed with a strong
collection of Beatlesque rockers, stum-
bled through a patchy set and was slow.to
establish the momentum it has accom-
plished on record.

The Beat. on the other hand. came out '

smokin’ from the word “go” and never
let up. Compelled by rhythm guitarist
and lead singer Paul Collins, The Beat
displayed a pure love for the rock and roll
of life. Its songs are a celebration of the
ups and downs, the good and bad, of
everyday existence.

Collins was a wild man on the tiny
Decade stage. Whipping his head in ﬁts
of mania as if his neck were a spring and
throwing his body and soul into his songs

-while incessantly hovering over his

guitar, Collins seemed at any moment to
wipe out the remainder of his group. He

Larry Whitman, a native Pittsburgher,

cute—-just telling it like it is.

The Beat’s set ran through 14 raw and
basic tunes. Fresh and invigoratingly
honest, the songs were packed with a
richness of innocence.

In all fairness, 20/20 began their
Decade appearance without the assis-
tance of a sound check, and a good hunk
of their show was spent getting
everything together.

Things ﬁnally jelled on the set’s sixth
number, “Out of This Time?" which was
followed by a pumped-up version of
“And Your .Bird Can Sing.” Other
highlights included “Oh Cherriel” and
“Yellow Pills.” _

Forty minutes after 20/20 had begun
their show, they announced they had run
out of songs and accepted requests from
the Decade audience. Fortunately, this
Sunday night crowd was sympathetic to
the band’s initial problems and invited
them back for an unprecedented seven

less successful because’ such a bluesy

tion “Do You Hear the Voices You Left

Scott played a number of her own

“Autumn Leaves,” and “Can’t Take that
Away from Me.” Her style, light and
bouncy, relied on fast ﬁnger work and

December 22, 1979 '

Jazz vibrophonist Johnny Lytele visited
The Encore II Dec. 18-22 ‘and displayed
an adept and nimble style. Lytele
recruited .local Pittsburgh musicians

_ George Jones on congas, David Brahams

on organ and Dave Moore on drums for
what turned out to be a surprisingly tight
and accomplished group.

Over his 15-year career, Lytele has
released some thirty albums, and he cites
Lionel Hampton as his primary influence
and inspiration. “I probably wouldn't be
playing if it wasn’t for him,” Lytele
remarked after his particularly lively

. second set of three he performed during

his stay at the Encore _II.

Lytele and Company instrumentalized
some original music as well as many

' cover versions, including “lsn’t She

Lovely,” The Girl From Ipanea,”
“Rise,” “Feelings,” as well as a jazzy
rendition of “Santa Clause Is Coming To
Town.” His funky version of “Send In
The Clowns” was one of the evening’s
many highlights. '

All in all,. Lytele combined bell-like,

crystal solos with the full harmonies, of his
backing players for another superb show

J ‘Phoenix,’-Fogelbe

By KAREN METZINGER

‘Dan Fogelberg
Phoenix
Epic/ Full Moon

Dan Fogelberg’s newest album,
“Phoenix,” could be termed the
deﬁnitive Fogelberg album to date.
For better and, sometimes, for
worse, “Phoenix” contains musical
inﬂuences from his ﬁve previous
albums. '

“Phoenix’s” ten songs are
written by Fogelberg, with the
composer performing all musical

, parts on the opening prelude,

“Tullamore Dew, ” and the closing
ballad, ‘ ‘Along the Road. ”

The title track—a country/ rock
tune—--reﬂec_ts a wiser complement
of instruments and lyrics than
previous efforts. “Gypsy Wind” 1

follows with a soft, steady rhythm
and acoustic guitar interspersed
with tasteful touches of electric
guitar. The instruments create a ‘
musical memory that augment the '
affectionate lyrical remembrance. ,
“The Last to Know” continues in
the same vein but is a letdown
except for the too—brief segment of
Spanish guitar. The lyrics portray a
painful, bitter memory of love not
working out, and the song is top
prettied-up with multiple vocal and
synthesizer embellishments. Side
One ends with the first Fogelberg
straight forward rock tune, “Face
the Fire’ ’—a nuclear doom song-
with session drummer Russ Kunkel

_ carrying the force, matched by

Fogelberg's commanding vocals
and truly sterling electric guitar
work.

“Wishing on the Moon,” ‘
opening Side Two, is reminiscent of
the slick L.A. sound of “Souvenirs”
but lacks that album's success in
pairing the sound to lyrics that
mirror personal experience. Here,
the lyrics sound rhetorical and the
vocals too slick. “Heart Hotels”
has some fine jazzy stuff: clean
piano and vocals, congas and a
smoldering saxophone solo by Tom
Scott. _ / _

Following is “Longer,” a simple,
pairing-of-nature-and-emotion love
song, a perfect medium for
Fogelberg’s voice and the cohesive
amalgam of acoustic guitar,
ﬂugelhorn and harp. A haunting
solo by horn player Jerry Hey__in the
middle of the tune prevents it from
getting too lush and mushy.

“Beggar’s Game” has a strong
melody, strong lyrics and vocals,
with ﬁne-sounding pianos and
electric guitar. But too much of
these get lost beneath the over
riding synthesizer. Finally, “Along

 

;&. ,.
Dan Fogelberg

Capsulizing in lyrics-and melody both personal andfprofessional growth

the Road” features Fogelberg’s
instrumental and vocal dexterity,
capsulizing in lyrics and melody
both personal and professional
growth.

“Phoenix" is perhaps, Dan
Fogelberg’s most impressive
album, resplendent in high-caliber
musicianship and variety of both
lyrics and music forms.

!

Fogelberg’s voice is at its best, and
his instrumental ability will delight
fans and‘ surprise doubters. But the
faults of the album are too much of
its virtues: often over-orchestrated,
too many overdubbed vocals, and
heavy-handed use of the
synthesizers. But, on the whole, ..
the album is an admirable,
satisfying effort and a new direction
with a toe hold in the past.

‘Touch Of Love’ Not Average ~   3 .

By DAVID STUBBS

Slave
Just A Touch Of Love
Cotillion

One of the better-kept secrets in
the late ’70s, high-powered music
industry was the e_mergence of high
quality funk. In 1977, funk bands
popped up everywhere with a

' rough, hard and steady approach to
R&B. The melodies were simple,
the lyrics were, to say the least,
interesting, and theoverall sound
danceable and fun.

-Groups like Cameo,
ConFunkShun, Mass Production
and Slave were the best of the new

_ groups who, along with the ,

established leaders Kool & the
Gang, The Chic Players, The Bar
Kays and Parliament/Funkadelic,
made up the major funk market.

' Soon the ﬁeld ﬁlled up with

imitatorsﬂand funk began to sound,
overall, just average.

One of the true survivors of the

T|CKETS'THAR BOX OFFICE & L NATIONAL RECORD MARTS.

  s'rAN1.YA'rI:n

  

music industry’s mainstreaming of
funk is Slave, producing probably
some of the most original sounds in
modern pop music. Slave can be
rough, highly rhythmic, p
syncopated, sharp and extremely

clean. Their sound is achieved by’ a '

‘ high-powered five-piece rhythm
section (dual guitars) that provides

a spontaneous rhythmic freedom.
three horns and newly acquired
female and male vocalists. At the
heart of Slave’s sound is bassist
Mark Adams, whose hard attack
and precise bass approach give a
Slave their uniqueness.

Slave’s latest, “Just A Touch of
Love, ”— their fourth album for
Cotillion records, continues where
the highly acclaimed ‘ ‘The
Concept” left off. They have
maintained their bouncy rhythm
approach while getting increasingly
more subtle with their vocal and
horn arrangements. _Lead guitarist
Mark Hicks has a lazy and cool
vocal that fits perfectly with Slave’s
rhythmic style.

Fans should remember Hicks
(Drac) from the hit ‘ ‘Slide” on
Slave’s ﬁrst album “Slave,” and
“Drac Is Back” from “The
Concept.” Drac is back again on
the bouncy, perfectly arranged title
cut as well as the high energy
‘ ‘Shine. ’ ’

Slave’s real class can be heard on
‘ ‘Thank You,” where Adams shows
his stuff by giving a rough touch to
an otherwise tender tune. Band
leader Steve Washington has done
a superb job of arranging the horns
and vocals as well.

“Shine” and “Foxy Lady” are
the rhythmic gems on the album.
“The Warning’ ’ is another silly yet
interesting Slave theme song. The
cut is a repetitious, highly
electronic groove surrounded by an

_ assortment of spaced-out vocal

colorings.
Groups like Slave offer real

i , promise for the popular music

scene, which has been crowded
with phonics and unprofessionals.
“Just A Touch Of Love” is
recommended for those who are
ready for straight-ahead dance
music filled with energy, great
musicianship and just a touch of
love. —

The song is worthy of its airplay,
but no one song can be expected to
carry an entire album. It receives

are ﬂawless, but the full

Inmates cont. I

(Continued from page 15)
I deploy all three of these elements.

Peter Gunn, the band’s lead
singer and guitarist, has a musical
style that is almost pure, distilled

Chuck Berry. Compared to other
competitors in the field, Gunn
avoids both the nonstop
hyper-rifting of George Thorogootb
and the rockabilly sweetened solos:
. of Dave Edmunds. '
— Gu“nn’s vocals are a perfect
to his music; he recalls
‘English rock vocalists like Mike

Jagger and Keith Reif (of the I
Yardbirds) when they were in their
R&B heyday. No attempts to be
cute, just straight singing and
playing. I

The songs themselves are pretty
much standard R&B infused rock
like “Back In History” and “Love

Got Me.” The standout, though, is '

“Dirty Water,” a song originally
done in the mid-60s by a crew of
psychedelic punks called the
Standells, a song reminding us that
the good white R&B donein the 60s
didn’t all come from Britain.

As far as complaints go, there are
no songs originating from within
the band. This leaves us to guess
about future possibilities. Further,
no attempts are made to extend the
boundaries of an admittedly limited
genre.

These are really quibbles about a
debut album, though, particularly
one as hot as this one. If you're not
getting enough rock'n’roll, commit
yourself along with The Inmates.

Starjets Fly
A On First

' The Starjets

God Bless The Starjets
Portrait

By GEORGE SHANER

One important quality of the new
wave is the way it has opened‘ up
previously untapped reservoirs of
talent. Take Ireland, for example.
Before the mid-1970s, very few
notable bands had come out of that
country. Now we have The
Boomtoyvn Rats, Protex, The
Undertones, Stiff Little Fingers,
and-in this case, The Starjets,

Many of these bands come from
Belfast, cauldron of religious strife,
and this violence has made its mark
upon the music. Stiff Little Fingers
are agit-prop rockers out to protest
the violence. The Undertones take

— , the opposite tack and concentrate

upon making “good time music” to
shut out the storm. The Starjets
come somewhere between these
two ends of the spectrum with the
attitude, “I’m so sick of this and I
want to get out.”

The music itself borders between
punk and power pop, a style best
exemplified by The Boomtown Rats
and the Philadelphia band, The I
A’s. When The Starjets have the
right balance, the songs are very
good. If they stray too far in the
pop direction though, the result is
some pretty soppy rock ballads.

In any case, the whole first side
burns cheerily along with songs like
“Ten Years,” reminiscent of I
“Who’s Next” period Who, and
“Run With The Pack,” which
sounds like stripped-down
Ca1ifornia‘surf rock, harmonies and
all.’ Also on this side is “What A
Life,” -the album’s best cut, which
totally sums up the Starjets’ hopes

and disgust.

The second side has its moments,
particularly “Sitting On T opJOf The
World,” a “local boy makes good”
story. Unfortunately, all the
offending ballads are also on this‘
side; most have good lyrics but all
fail upon execution .

“God Bless The Starjets” is
deﬁnitely a “plus” album overall
with a great deal to recommend it.
If the Starjets follow their better
instincts, they may be around for a
good while.

tunes and lyrics needed for good
pop, its approach to the music is
best described as progressive. Tie
this in with their new wave image
and you have a neat puzzle indeed.

‘ ‘Drums And Wires’ ’ is the first
of XTC’s three albums to be
released in the United States, and it
represents a broadening of horizons
for the band. In a sense, XTC is _
comparable to the Talking Heads in
that both bands have-retainedtheir
basic style (mechanized pop vs. .
syncopated funk rock) while coming
up with an unexpectedly strong
artistic statement on their
respective third albums.

Side One kicks off with two of the
wacky pun-filled rockers people
expect from XTC—“Life Begins At
The Hop” and “Helicopter’ ’. ,
Where ‘ ‘Helicopter” is par for this
band, ‘ fLife Begins At The Hop’ ’
tempers the fun with a bit nostalgia
for the band’s early career. While

,. “When You're Near Me I Have

Difﬁculty’ ’ falls into their usual I
style, contrast is provided by the
acoustically oriented love song 
“Ten Feet Tall” and “Making
Plans For Nigel,” a driving blur of a

/ rocker that was a Top 10 single in

the U.K.

Side One sticks pretty much to
personal affairs all the way
through. Side Two, on the
other hand, concerns itself with
social commentary and paranoia.
This can be compared to the switch
the Talking Heads pulled on ‘ ‘Fear
Of Music” with songs like“ ‘Life
During Wartime” and “Memories '
Can’t Wait,” compared to songs
like “Take Me To The River.”

‘ ‘Millions’ ’ is a warning about
ingesting -too much “Western
thinking” with an Orientalelement
to the arrangement. “Complicated
Game” is a quiet tune on futility set
off by Andy Partridge’s outraged
vocals. Finally, “Real To Reel”
and ‘ ‘Scissor Man” take on the ever
popular subject of ‘ ‘someone—’s out -
to get me,” humorized in a
deadpan manner.

With excellent aural quality
provided by producer Stever
Lillywhite, ‘ ‘Drums And Wires’ ’
was one of the best albums to pop
up late last year. With the variety
‘of material and approach XTC

offers up, one really can’t go too
wrong. ‘

Ritchie Blackmoreof Rainbow 

still Volatile And Unpredictable

(Continued from page 10) .

Rainbow line-up. Singer Ronnie ‘Dio,
Bassist Bob Daisley, and keyboardist
David Stone, were recently sacked by
Blackmore. '

Of the ten songs Rainbow played in its
hour and fifteen minute set, eight were
from the new album “Down to Earth.”
Since Blackmorelis never one for playing
and relieving yesterday’s triumps, the
group seemed determined to prove itself
with this new music. ’

And with the addition of three highly
talented new members, ex-Marbles lead
singer Graham Bonnet, ex-Colluseum

keyboardist Don Airey, and his Deep

Purple mate, bassist and co-songwriter
Roger Glover, there would seem to be
plenty of new musical triumps ahead of
Blackmore and crew.

Opening on a smoke-ﬁlled stage,
Airey’s haunting, Star War’s-like syn-
thesizer passage set a mysterious mood
as Rainbow charged into “Eyes of the
World,” the best song off of the new
album. i

Also scoringiimpressively were “All
Night Long,” “No Time to Love,”

"“Makin' Love,” the FM hit “Since

9!

You’ve B.een Gone, “Love’s No
Friend,” “Danger Zone,” “A Light in
the Black,” “Man on the Silver
Mountain” and “Lost in Hollywood.”
During the evening’s performance,
Blackmore improvised,‘-experimented and

took chances with the music, and the '

other members of Rainbow more than

- met the challenge.

Bonnet, while looking a bit new
waveish with short hair, tie and sport
coat, is a charismatic young singer with a
clear, soulful voice who has much better
stage presence than ex-Rainbow lead
singer Ronnie Dio ever had.

Glover has added a high artistic sense
to many of the songs, and his solid bass
parts help bring out the best in
Blackmore’s g/uitar.

Airey an<TPowell were impressive with
their respective and tolerable 10-minute
solos during a frantic version of “Lost in
Hollywood.”

Powell, in particular, delivered a solo

, which he has featured in past concerts.

Yet it still remains an exhilarating and
imaginative drum presentation.

Building from an eerie synthesizer
passage from Airey, Powell played along

with a booming tape of the “1_812'_
Overture,” crashing his cymbals in time '

to the exploding cannons, accompanied
_by throbbing strobe lights.

‘Blackmore seems to have found the
right musical mixture with the new

—Rainbow, however don't be surprised if -
_ he once moreshakes up the band at the

drop of the hat. Permanence just doesn’t

' seem to be a part of him and in typical

Blackmore fashion, the December show
ended on a note_of confusion.

_During the encore song, “Man on the
Silver Mountain,” Bonnet sustained a
long vocal note at the song’s completion

and then passed the ball back over the '
Blackmore, who tried to get a jam ‘

together with Airey.

When he realized after five minutes of ,

fruitless poodling that they were not
going to get on the same musical wave-
length, Blackmore ﬁred his arm into the
air and with a closing of his first
pronounced, “that’s it,” calmly putting
his guitar down. He then walked off
stage, leaving the rest ‘of the band and the
entire audience totally befuddled at this
rather odd time to call it quits despite
Obvious pleas from the -Stanley crowd.

Instead of going out with a bang’. ‘

Blackmore let Rainbow ﬁzzle out at the
end.

‘Two minutes later, with the audience
still on it's feet screaming for more, the
soothing sounds of “Oh, Little Town of
Bethlehem” drifted out the banks of
speakers. Unquestionably, a ﬁnal and

unpredictable parting shot from Black-
more.

Opening for Rainbow was Gamma, a
new ﬁve~piece band led by Ronnie
Montrose, a well-seasoned and talented
guitarist who has played.with Edgar
Winter and fronted his own band,’
‘Montrose, in the early and mid-1970’s.

Gamma played a brand of loud -and
technical style of music which heavily
emphasized Montrose’s talent for pulling

hypnotic patterns of sound from his '

guitar. , .
This was evident on two of Gamma’s
better received songs of the evening,
“I’m Alive” and “Razor King,” but the
rest of the band didn’t seem to quite
match up with Montrose, and this made
some of the songs bog a bit.
- Blackmore didn’t have that problem
with his new band, and although times
and tastes change, Ritch the Bitch

F remains one of rock music’s most volatile ~

and ‘inﬂammatory, performers.
