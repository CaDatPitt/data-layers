Scaife Rape Suspect  

Arraigned on Tuesday

I By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

A suspect arrested Tuesday in
connection with an alleged rape of
an 18-year-old Pitt woman last
month in a Scaife Hall restroom,
may himself have been_the victim
of an unfair arrest.

Anthony Eaves, 24, of Whiteside
Road, the Hill District was
arraigned Tuesday night before
District Magistrate James Russo on
charges of allegedly raping a Pitt
coed at knifepoint April 10 in a
fourth ﬂoor Scaife Hall restroom.

either phoned Eaves’ mother or
Eaves himself following the is-
suance of the warrant, telling him
to surrender to police. Police said
this is not a correct arrest
procedure. .

The needs of a warrant came
following three weeks of investiga-
tions by both city and campus
police.

City detectives became suspi-
cious yesterday when Eaves
appeared in city court to inquire
why the police were searching for

SGB, BAS Brawl in A/locations Meeting Turned Fracas

Stan Galanski must have been wondering why he
was there. A

The former Pitt lobbyist turned Student Govern-
ment Board president was trying to match his voice
against 250 angry black students at the SGB’s April
11 meeting, the last of the winter term.

The Black Action Society, angry over having
another $1,000 stripped from its budget next year,
appeared in force at the meeting in the Lower Lounge
of the Student Union. The meeting was supposed to
be a budget review for student organizations, not
governance groups.

As far as the SGB was concerned, the question of
governance group funding had already been an-
swered.

The board already had been presented with an
Allocations Committee proposal to increase funding
for five of the seven governance groups. The extra
money would come at the expense of theother two
groups, BAS and Residence Student Association.
And the SGB had regretfully accepted that commit-
tee’s recommendation, a $4,000 decrease in the BAS
budget and substantial increase for the Inter-
Fraternity Council, Panhellenic Association and
Engineering Student Cabinet early April.

A few days later, in a bizarre move, the board sud-
denly decided to slash every gr0up’s budget. BAS,

had their budget cut by $2,000), still hadto stomach
another $1 ,OO0 cut.

Which leads us to ‘the April 11 meeting in the
Lower Lounge.

After Galanski had finished reviewing the budgets
of some 50 student organizations, BAS members
demanded to be heard-all at the same time.

They -began shouting and clapping and the six
board members seated before them (Todd Park was

columnist—ait-large

absent) appeared as fidgety as the plainclothes cam-
pus police called in to assure order.

After about ten minutes of Teamsters-type chaos,
Galanski suddenly rose and raised both hands in
frustration. .

“Even though it may not look like it, I’m still in
charge of this meeting,” he said. He then recognized
BAS representative Marc Holloway and chairperson
Mona Riscoe. .

Holloway and Riscoe preached the inefficiencies of
the Pitt Union Program Council and the reliability of
black programming. This programming was the
primeﬂsource of cutbacks from the $23,095 BAS

request. The Allocations Committee had insisted the
programs were not well thought out and did not serve
the campus as a whole. '

After Holloway and Riscoe were finished, other
students expressed a few thoughts of their own.

One student suggested the BAS consider Affirm-
ative. Action or Civil (Rights action (this has not
been followed through), another student advocated a
separate “Black Students Activities’ Fee,” a
ludicrous proposal that would lead to more mass
confusion within Pitt’.s already stifling bureaucracy
as well as total segregation on campus. V . A

It was interesting to note the actions of the ine -
perienced board members during the meeting. 0

New members Cindy DeMatteo, Helen Gianella
and Kim Watterson tried to ease the situation with
sugar-coated remarks.

“I sympathize with you. Nobdy understands the
problem more than I do.”

“I wasall for giving you more money.”

“We have our problems too.”

These remarks only brought jeers and one—linersi
from the crowd. I

Rookie member Tom Kunkel didn’t say much.
He let his fingers do the talking. .

Heckled by a student a few feet away, Kunkel in-
dicated with sign language that he desired a little tete-

Office of Student Activities Calls
Search For Heaps’ Replacement

Srakocic photo.’ A.

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice
chancellor for student affairs, has
formed a search committee to ﬁnd
a new director of student activities.
Kimbo hopes to hire the new
director by July 1. ,

The position has been vacant
since the sudden resignation of
Willard “Bud” Heaps last Novem-
ber.

Terri Milani, associate director
of student activities, has been
performing some of the duties of
director since the Heaps’ resigna-
tion.

The search committee is com-
posed of ﬁve university officials
and four students.

Committee members from‘ the
University include chairperson Bob

Gallagher, director of Counseling

and Placement, Ken Metz, Univer-
sity Senate student affairs commit-
tee member, Joann Gibbs, Ofﬁce of
Residence Life, Lou McLinden,
assistant director of student activi-
ties, and Sue Shearing, of the
University Counseling Center.

Student members of the commit-
tee include a representative from
each of the following groups:
Student Government Board, Black
Action Society, Graduate Student
Association, and the School of

General Studies. Student Cabinet‘. '

Kimbo said the search for a new
director began April 16 and the
position is being advertised nation-
ally.

“We are not necessarily going
off campus to ﬁnd the new director,
but we want a diverse group of

applicants,” Kimbo, said. _

Some of the required qualiﬁca-
tions for the position include a
minimum of a master’s degree in
higher education, administration or
a related ﬁeld, and ﬁve years of
administrative experience in stud-
ent activities and/ or student union
management. These qualiﬁcations
are included in the advertisements
for the job.

Kimbo says that the new director
will assume the responsibilities of
the job August 1, 1979.

When asked whether the new
director will replace existing
employees of the student activities
ofﬁce, Kimbo said it was doubtful.

“I would not expect the director
to come in and clean house unless
people were not producing,” he
said. “If you have good people, it

is foolish to release them.—’.’  - ._ ,

Galanski — Ready to Take That Third Giant Step?

a-tete with the student after the meeting. In a ﬂeeting
moment of diplomacy, Kunkel simply used his right
forefinger to say “You”!-"Me”-“Later.”

The meeting ended with a motion by board mem-
ber Rita Cordisco to reconsider the budgets. The
vote was a tie, 3-3, killing the motion.

Galanski said earlier this past week that he'hadV

heard no “formal” complaint from BAS leaders.
Galanski‘ has had to orient six board members,
work with less student activities money and deal with

an Allocations Committee determined’ to cut BAS ,

funds. ,_ .
K “The results are not totally pleasing to me,”
Galanski said of the ‘BAS-allocations fiasco. ‘‘It’s

’ something I have to live with.”

“L think if we are going to make any changes we
are going to have to tread cautiously. We have a new
vice chancellor (for student affairs) and we have to_
really be careful.” .

The fact that BAS members had a chance to argue
at last months meeting was actually a change for the
better.

students wereeither in Florida, Wildwood or home,

wondering whether their summer jobs would enable . 3

The first result of this noble change? Confusion.

This confusion was brought about by a stubborn

an acceptable budgetquickly enough and -six new
board members.

The second result? Loss of credibility in the son-

Galanski said-. “It’s unfortunate when that happens

State College’s permit to enroll
foreign students is about to be
withdrawn by federal authorities
due to alleged irregularities in
admitting foreign students.

The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service notified the
school this week of its intent to
withdraw the authorization, a
move that virtually will shut down
the Erie County school’s foreign
student operation.

Lawrence Nanns, vice president

a for student personnel services, said

the school does not intend to appeal
the permit revocation, but he said
an attempt will be made to allow
foreign students already enrolled to

- Federal -

The possibility of an incorfect
arrest was not the only sidebar to
the alleged rape.

On April 12, students and
employees ofthe university staged
a demonstration outside Scaife Hall
aimed at alerting university offic-
ials to the lack of security and
safety problems within the univer-
sity.

According to Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham, a survey has
been compiled concerning Security
and Crime Prevention in the Pitt
community. The survey has been
worked on in the last weeks after
the rape occurred and will be ready

for submission to the Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance
and Vice Chancellor for Health
Related Professions on Friday.

Soon after the recent rape, there
was increased interest surrounding
protection on the Pitt campus and
the Oakland community. Accord-
-ing to Graham, this case was not
much different than others.

Peoples interest and concern
over protection are pushed to a
peak level in the days after an
incident occurs. Many people want
to be informed of the educational
programs offered by the police
department or the university.
Shortly thereafter, interest and fear

dies down, and few people continue
to attend meetings that are
provided for the discussion of self
protection.

“We have instituted programs
for a number of years independent-

ly and in conjunction with other‘

departments such as the Pitt’s
Women Center, the Staff Advisory

Board or the Office of Student
Affairs,” said Graham.

Generally some sponsor will help
get’ the word out of ‘these
meetings, and people do attend,
but not for long.

“Right after an incident occurs
there is a great deal of interest for
self-protection," said Graham,

“but after a few weeks people tend
to think ‘this won’t happerxtlo me
and they discontinue attending.”
Graham finds that another
problem with the educational
process concerning self-protection,
is the large and ever present
turnover of students attending the
university. '
“Thousands of students come
and leave every year, and many

,have yet to be exposed to urban

living. Because of the transience of
our community,” said Graham,
“things are made more difficult.
There is no magic force that
surrounds the university, we have
criminal problems like the rest of
the city.

Permit Ends Foreign Program At Edinboro

Edinboro, about 145 are foreign
and about 80 of those are Iranian.

The intent to withdraw author-
ization becomes effective in 30 days
unless the school appeals it, said
Robert Hallowell, chief of the
Immigration Service office in
Pittsburgh.

Nanns said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that Edin-

boro would not appeal the decision. a

“We accept their reasons. We
are acknowledging that there was
poor administrative judgment in
the use of I-20 forms,” Nanns said.

I-20 forms are certificates of
eligibility for prospective foreign
students to apply for visas, and
then to enter the United States to
attend the school that issued the
I-20, Hallowell said.

. -:'-i~ ‘ it if  A 
g I I SGSCIKREER WORKSHOP
HOWTO

~ - State -

The documents must be com-
pleted in this country. In
Edinboro’s case, an investigation
found that I-20s had been only
partially completed and then sent
abroad.

According to Nanns. Edinboro
entered into an agreement in 1975
with the Iranian Ministry of
Education. The ministry had asked
for 50 blank I-205 and received 12,
Nanns said.

“When the forms are mis-
handled, they'become available to
the unscrupulous and may be
issued to unqualiﬁed students or
persons who have no intention of
attending school. They can become
a valuable entry document to the
United States,” Hallowell said.

“There was no monetary gain at
the school and that was clearly not
their intent. The school was
interested solely in acquiring more
students,” he added.

Nanns said Edinboro will eval-
uate, its approach to international

education and reorganize the I

administration of its program
before reapplying for authorization
to have foreign students.

“We do not look upon having .

foreign students as a ﬁnancial gain.

We are too large a school to depend 7

on, that, but we do look upon their
presence as an enrichment,” Nann
said.

We can’! afford to waste it.

Leaving Well
Enough Alone

It is grimly ironic that a bill for reinstating the‘
military draft is currently being debated upon by a
house subcommittee—on roughly the fourth anniver-
sary of the fall of Saigon. '

The Vietnam War left scars on the American
psyche so deep that now, five years later, they still
have not healed. Bringing back the draft, in a blase
way of sweeping all that pain under a rug of com-
placency, does not guarantee that there will be
another war, but it is still the first step in that direc-
tion. .

‘ In this apathetic aftermath, it is highly likely that,

with a few revisions, the bill will pass. Should this «

happen, registration of eligible males would likely
begin within a few months, but actual induction
would be postponed until 1981——after the 1980
presidential elections.

The reinstation of a peacetime draft, proponants
of the bill argue, would rebuild the diminished ranks
of the military in case of war.

Opponents feel that an involuntary draft not only

' violates the rights of American citizens, but that it is

a deceptive process. For example, during the Viet-
nam War, a number of pacifists and Quakers

7 registered, taking no action until they were actually

inducted.

Formal and organized opposition to the revival has
not been inactive, but it, like the bill itself, has been
virtually ignored by the media. And small-scale
rallies, like the one slated toybe held in conjuncture
with an outdoor concert on Flagstaff Hill this Sun-
day afternoon, are coming again to college cam-
puses. ’

We urge‘ everyone to write their congressman,

"stating whythey feel the draft should not be rein-

stated. It is a traditional means—and often a futile
one-—but the effort is needed now. A large number
of letters would have some effect. The time for ac-

tion is now, while we are dealing with proposals, not
actualities. *

Most Pitt students are too young to really recall the
war, but most have had some sort of personal ex-
posure—a friend, a relative, perhaps who served.
Perhaps the recent flush of Vietnam films——“The
Deer Hunter,” “Coming Home”—are box office
successes because in their intensity, they diffuse and

* pinpoint some of the guilt many of us still feel over

Vietnam.

But buying tickets to a movieior talking over the.

tragedy of American involvement in Vietnam is not
important. Prevention is.

(«

Saigon, incidentally, has risen from the "ashes.
Not like the phoenix of myth but recycled as Ho Chi
Minh City. There is a ban there on private trade and
30,000 small businesses closed in the past year.
The entirecountry has been devastated by a record
rice shortage caused by pest damage and floods and
there was continued fighting in Cambodia that
prompted a Chinese invasion of Vietnam.

And that is part of the aftermath in Vietnam.
The resumption of the draft may be part of ours.

along a copy of the timeischedules
and course descriptions—which list
a convenient code cracking list-
everywhere I go because it’s
awkward and both copies are
falling apart from much crumbling
and perusing. Finally, I don’t give
primary importance to where a
class is being held. Most seniors
past their fourth year at Pitt are not
choosy about class selection since
their major is completed. .Most,
like me, just stare blanklyi at a list
of schedules and push the little
blue form to our advisers saying,
“Oh. God, sign me up for anything

as long as it isn't math or
chemistry.’ ’
So, months after going through

registration, there is that moment’

of truth—the first day of classes.
And not knowing where you’re
supposed to be because of two
arbitrary little initials that don’t
explain much of anything.

Sure, some are logical and easy
to ﬁgure out. It was easy enough to

deal with CL (Cathedral of

Learning—a snap) and DL (David
Lawrence I Hall—what else?)
because the initials make sense.
And I gave myself a mental pat on
the back for— deciphering ‘ FA
correctly as (Frick) Fine Arts
instead of Falk Auditorium.
Consider though, the abbrevia-
tion for Forbes Complex—FQ.

OR

THE pmcmoat

Pitt’s Building Code—Not So Letter Perfect  

Show me where there is a “Q” in
those words. The ‘only explanation
I can come up with is that it stands
for questionable.

The only rule is that logical
interpretations do not necessarily
hold. Pennsylvania Hall is not PH
but PA; though PA would seem the
likely abbreviation for Parran Hall,
which is one I’ve never learned,
although PH, which could stand for
either, is the Graduate School of
Public Health. I

Crawford Hall is CD, the Crump
Building is CP, Frick School is FK.
Sometimes, the initials stand for a
street, now a building; hence, CR
(400 South Craig) and HR (Henry
Street).

Thaw Hall is TA and AX stands
for the Student Union Annex.

Then there’s the case of Allen
Hall (AH) and Alumni Hall (AL)
which could so easily be reversed.
Or LI, which is the Library of
Sciences Information building and
KH, which is really Children’s
Hospital.

Confused? There’s more to

come. Should your list of classes I

have the prefix NC, your class is
taking place in the New Castle
Youth Development Center. With
cross-registration, between city
colleges, it is not difficult to discern
that CC is Chatham College. But,
if the initials are BT or CN, your
class is in Butler or Clarion,
respectively.

The final confusing note: DT
stands for Downtown-Kaufmans.

No Problem For Police

Do you realize that policemen
don’t have to adhere to the same
parking regulations that all of the
commuters at Pitt do? Yesterday
while walking down Oakland
Avenue, we saw a campus police
car park illegally near an intersec-
tion, and then the policemen from
the car casually strolled into a
nearby restaurant. Because we
were curious about the legality of
such an action, we phoned the
Campus Police Station. We
reported the situation exactly as it
occurred and asked whether or not

,police are able to illegally park

anywhere regardless of whether
there is an emergency or not.

(There was obviously no emer-
gency in this situation because we

saw the three campus ‘policemen in

the restaurant eating.) The lady we
spoke with said that, yes, that was
true since’police cars are registered
as emergency vehicles and, thus,
can park wherever they want at any
time. Being disbelieving souls, we
then called the Pittsburgh police
and asked the same question. We
got the exact same reply. We are
unsure of the validity of the replies

A we received, since the identities of

the people we spoke with were
withheld from us, but if it is true
that police can park illegally at
their own discretion, we must
question whether it is fair that
those who we trust to uphold the
law most are not the onesiwho most
adhere to the law.

Goff, explained. ’

“The women have been running,
jumping and throwing well, so we
hope to win,” said Goff. “I don’t
expect anything outstanding but I
wouldn’t be surprised.”

Last season, the Pantherette
track squad was undefeated» in
dual- and tri-meet competition, but
one team cameuncomfortably close
to upsetting Pitt.

Although Pitt had won almost
every even in last year’s meet with
Kent State, the Golden Flashes had
enough depth to tie the Panther-

pattern.

Pitt’s baseball team (11-2) kept
its NCAA playoff hopes alive by
sweeping a double-header from
Indiana (Pa.) 5-2 and 5-1, yesterday
at Trees Field. .

The Panthers probably will
receive an at-large bid to the
NCAA’s, should they“ defeat Penn
State and Temple, two of their six

‘ remaining opponents.

Pitt meets Penn State in a
double-header this Sunday at
University Park, and will close out

\its season against Temple, May 13,
at Trees Field. Pitt lost to both
teams last season.. .

“We definitely will have to beat
Penn State and Temple, but the
important thing is to keep
winning,” Pitt coach Bob Lewis
said. “We have some tough games
coming up. 'Clarion is very good.”

Pitt hosts Clarion in a double-
header Saturday at Trees Field.

The Panthers stretched their
winning streak to four with
yesterday’s_ double-header win.

Against Indiana (13-6), the
Panthers needed big innings in

Pitt, on the other hand, should
prove better in the throwing and
relay events, although several
Pantherettes are as good, if not
better, than the Kent State
mainstays.

The high jump will be a duel
between KSU’s Maureen Decker
and Pantherettes Karen Krichko
and Marie Ribik. All three have
cleared 5’9.

Pantherette MVP Gwen Murray,

both games to sweep their fourth
doubleheader of the season.

In the first game, Pitt scored four
times in the second inning to
assure its tenth win of the season.
The Panthers had been losing 1-0.

Pitt ‘also trailed in the second
game, 1-0, but exploded for five
runs in the ﬁfth inning to win

I easily.

“I thought we did pretty well
considering that we hadn’t played
for a week,” Lewis said. “Neither
Allen Lachowicz nor Don Koller
had pitched for 11 days.”

Lachowicz . was the winning
pitcher in the first game. , The
freshman from McKees Rocks
allowed only two hits.

“In the last inning, I loosened
up, but I was really tight at the
start,” Lachowicz said. “It wasn’t
my worst game of my career, but it
was a close second.”

Lachowicz’ record is now 3-0.

Meanwhile, Don Koller won the
second game. Suffering from the
ﬂu, the junior did not let the illness
bother him as he struck out 10 and
raised his record to 3-0.

  Half-Miler Geary Arrives at By Way of Bryans Road .

By ANNA ARLOTTAV
Pitt News Staff Writer
All college athletes and students

"have something in common.’

Everyone, at one time or another,
has gone through an adjustment
period in their first year of school
and Pitt’s Darren, Geary, a
freshman middle distance runner,
is no exception. ‘
Geary’s home town is Bryans
Road, Maryland, where he began
to run organized track in middle
school. His high school track team

ich has announced the signing

toward Marquette.

’ aging,

consisted of only seven members, \
hardly an atmosphere conclusive to
running: He experienced a number
of coaches who were not interested
in sticking with track long enough
to give any amount of instruction to
their athletes. ,
Despite.these problems and the’

fact it was virtually impossible for a
seven-man team to ever win a dual
meet, Geary developed into a
top-notch runner on his own. While
his team was losing every meet by
lopsided scores, Geary was busy
collecting awards for his individual
performances. He was a four-time
state champ in the mile relay, 1000
and 800-yard runs. He still. holds
the Maryland State records for the
latter two events with times of
2:15.2 and 1:53.5 respectively. His
senior year’s performance enabled
him to be ranked third nationally in
the 1000, a position which gave him
high school all-America status. . His
contributions in other sports-
quarterback of the football team

» and a member of the basketball

team—earned him Athlete of the
Year honors from his high school.
So what has kept Geary
progressing in track despite all the
obstacles he had to face?
“Team-wise, track was discour-
but track is only a
team-oriented sport to a degree. It
is also an individual sport,” said
Geary. “My progression helped a

great deal in keeping me involved . _

a something is

in the sport,” he added, “when
going well one
continues. I didn’t have much
encouragement from my coaches
(he says “coaches” because he
competed under four different
coaches in four years of high
school) or from the students in my
high school. What helped was my
family and a lot of self-motivation,
self"-discipline H and self-satisfac-
tion.”

After high school, Geary chose
Pitt over a number of different
colleges. Many of these schools
were a good deal more track-
oriented than Pitt but did not have
the right combination of programs
Geary was looking for. -

“It was important for me to find
a school that would mix good
athletics with good academics. I
was impressed with Coach Agos-
tinella’s interest with academics

when he was recruiting me. " Pitt .

had a good program to offer me for
my major of Administration of
Justice and great facilities for
indoor and outdoor track, plus we
are competing in a number of big
meets.” I
According to Agostinella, Geary
has progressed nicely in college
competition and in making the
transition to college level athletics.
“Darren has come along nicely
from competing in his high school
to the Pitt track program, said
Agostinella,. _He is, an extremely

talented runner with tremendous
speed in the half mile. He is
learning college tactics for compet-
ing in his events. I believe, it
depends upon the race as to
whether he will qualify for
nationals or not.”

“I think he has an excellent shot
through the remainder of the
season. Once he makes the total
adjustment of that first year in

college, I think he will be sitting on

top of the half mile race.”

In his ﬁrst season of Pitt indoor
track, Geary was named to the
all-East team for his performance
in the 1000. Despite this, Geary
described his ﬁrst indhoorlseason as
pleasing, but not satisfying. 0 ‘

“I was pleased with lastpseasonp
but I wasn’t satisﬁed with it. I

wanted to do much better: The F
1000 isn’t run outdoors b_utj.__‘ by ‘-

running it indoors it helps
strengthen me for my outdoor;
events.” ‘  ‘

So‘ far in the outdoor season,
which is now past its’ midpoint,
Geary has been competing on the
2-mile relay team as the leadoff
runner along with Greg Conover,
Bill McShea, and ‘Joel Albers.

“Actually, all four of us are
freshman to the 2-mile relay,

i i

b I’ 2’ _
‘Li‘.» ,1’ {A . 1

because none of us has ever
competed in this event,” said
Geary. Joel and I are freshman to
the team, and Bill hasn’t run in two
years since competing in the

quarter mile. Also Greg had never’

run in this event (the 880).

Yet the foursome looked very
impressive in their relay competi-
tion, which is now over for the
college season. Their best time
was a 7:32. Now that the relay
meets are over, Geary is looking
with anticipation to competing in
the half mile. 7

“I’m anxious to run the half
mile. Here . is where you can
qualify for the nationals, unlike in
the 2-mile relay. Running leadoff
for the relay team,” said Geary,
‘,‘is just like running the half mile
event itself. The whole team can
only get better as the rest of the
5335011 m0VeS 011,” he continued.
“Everyone is running individually
now with the exception of the mile
relay team.”

“People like Larry Kinney (a
freshman triple jumper) and Gary
Siriano (a long distance runner)
along with the entire team can only
go up with the morepractice we get,
I have a lot of respect for my
teammates; we get along well,
which is very important to me and
to the sport.” - .

National League Roundup

Pirates Sail Past, Braves With Easy Victory, 10-2

By The Associated Press

A pair of two-run ‘homers by Bill
Robinson and John Candelaria’s
pitching keyed the Pittsburgh
Pirates to an easy 10-2 victory over
the Atlanta Braves last night.

Candelaria, 1-1, helped himself
with his ﬁrst hit of the season, a
two-run double.

Starter Mickey Mahler, 0-2, took
the loss.

Robinson’s homers, his third and
fourth of the season, both were hit
with Dave Parker on base. In the
ﬁrst inning, Parker doubled while
he reached on a ﬁelder’s choice in
the fourth.

The Pirates nailed down the

lopsided game in the third inning
when they scored ﬁve runs.

Tim Foli, Parker and Robinson
all singled to ﬁll the bases and Lee
Lacy scored Foli with a sacrifice ﬂy.
After Phil Garner struck out,
Rennie Stennett doubled to score
Parker and Robinson.

Frank Lacorte relieved Mahler
and walked catcher Steve Nicosia
intentiona11y._ Candelaria, who
pitched an eight-hitter, then
doubled.

Candelaria, who had been
bothered with a chronic back
problem earlier this season gave up
a run in the second inning when
Barry Bonnell singled and was

forced by Glenn Hubbard. Bruce
Benedict followed with a double to
center that scored Hubbard.

In the ﬁfth‘ inning, Pepe Frias led
off with a homer to left, the ﬁrst of
his major league career.

Candelaria had started four
games and relieved in another but
had pitched only 24 innings this
season. He had allowed 10 earned
runs and giving up 27 hits. The.
complete game was his ﬁrst since
June 21, 1978 against Chicago.

Robinson and Foli each had three
hits in the game and Robinson and
Parker each scored three runs. Foli
now has 10 hits in his last 17 at
bats.
