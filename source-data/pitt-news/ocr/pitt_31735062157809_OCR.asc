Court Revises
Point Scale

Revision of the Point Scale
System marks the ﬁrst of a ser-
“ies of steps taken by Senior
Court‘ to prepare for women’s
elections early in April.
It was found necessary to re-
_ vampthe point system since many

ago are inadequate at present,

Beginning Monday, a. list of
point changes will be posted on
the 12th Floor bulletin board.

* Interested women are urged to
note changes before elections.

It was found that, in many in-
stances, certain activities were
overpointed, and others badly un-
derpointed. Court has tried to
meet the medium in their revision.

The Point Scale system is a pro-
duct ..of the University of Pitts-
burgh women’s activities. It is de-
signed to protect the individual
student by regulating the number

I To Check Betitions ‘
‘According to. the nominating

~ committee petitionswill be ‘spot-A
checked and faked signatures will

result in immediate disqualiﬁca-
tion. _ , -

Of the eight senior nominees
three are connected with publica-
tions, while the rest represent al-
most a cross—section of under-

Activities Varied

Carlton Knox and Dozie Frazier,

have distinguished themselves in_

two different ﬁelds. Frazier is a

terman, is‘ president of the re-
organized Panther Club. He has
been a standout performer in
football, basketball and baseball

dean of men, said that, although
he was “not in favor” of the reso-
lution, he would not stand in its
way.

There was little said against the
motion on the ﬂoor of Congress.
Audrey Westerman made the point
that “the type of ‘girl who would
be a cheerleader” would not.be a
good representative of Pitt.

Bob Kingsley answered this ob-
jection by saying that his impres-
sion of a Penn State girl cheer-
leader had been very good.

A SECOND CHANCE,

On Monday afternoon the Chancellor is holding an open
house for -students of the Junior class. We ’re hoping that he
will have a better attendance for that than he had for his talk
to the students last week. ‘

For the beneﬁt of those who were unable to hear the chan-
cellor’s talk and for those who seemed to feel that the meet-
ing was not for them, We’re printing below a report of the

, chancellor ’s, report to the students.

Chancellor Gives Heart-

  To-Heart Talk at Assembly

Chancellor Fitzgerald last Wednesday got down to a genu-
ine heart—to-heart talk to Pitt’s students at the Student Con-
gress-sponsored assembly in Foster Memorial. '

The talk, Chancellor Fitzgerald’s ﬁrst informal general

get-together with the students,
aside from special student groups
’ and football rallies, gave the im-
pression that the leader of the

University is down to earth with
the students.

' In leading to his subject, “The
Development of a University,”
, Chancellor Fitzgerald pointed out
‘that the basic fundamentals of a
university-—-the buildings and ma-
terial aspect and the faculty and
students aspect—cannot each sepa-

rately represent a university, they

Primarily For Undergrads

ships.

-must be taken as a whole. One
part of a university cannot prog-
ress unless the rest of the univer-
sity is progressing with it.
Chancellor Fitzﬁerald pointed
out the fundamental difference
between A m e r i c a in universities
and many European universities.
Some European. .universities are

‘founded on the basis of a school

for fellows—graduated scholars
studying under’ advanced fellow-

The American university is primarily an institution for
undergraduate students. “Pitt is not a school for fellows, but
is a school for students,” said Dr. Fitzgerald.

Dr. Fitzgerald then pointed out that the place to ﬁnd out

about a college or university, if¢

one could not visit it, is through
the annual bulletin it issues. This
will tell a college-trained person,
through description of courses,
names of the faculty,~enrollment

-in various schools, building and
campus facilities, the kind" of in-
stiution it is.

“Just who is on the faculty,”
said Dr. Fitzgerald, “means a lot.
There are 70 of Pitt’s faculty list-
ed in ‘Who’s Who."”

It was pointed out that Pitt has
a major .role in modern educa-
tion, as indicated by the recent

Future is Promising

meeting on general education in
which Howard McGrath, the U. S.

Commissioner of Education, con- .

ferred with Pitt administrative

, leaders.

Dr. Fitzgerald ‘informed the stu-
dents that $15,439,000 is now be-
ing sought for the building fund,
of which $3,600,000 is to be ﬁ-
nanced. When asked why‘ Pitt
needs more buildings, the Chan-A
cellor replied with the question,
“Why has the enrollment grown
from 14,000 of 11 years ago to

25,000 today? ”

As an illustration of this point, he read an automobile
advertisement of 1912 which said that autos had reachedthe
ultimate in design in that year and then said that a’ collegiate

institution which held this attitude would never advance.

The Chancellor t h e n

said,¢

“We’re thankful we’re not like u]ty"he a1so.added_)

that,” talking about Pitt.

Dr. Fitzgerald ‘ stated that he
feels he is closer to the faculty
than to the students, and will try
to equalize this as soon as possible
(with, no dispersions on the fac-

, V He felt that if Pitt students are

serious about the building and
education program as are the fac-
ulty, and believe in the institution,
then “this institution is going to
get somewhere.”

I Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

The other day I was squattin’
around in the Panther Oﬁice do-
ing my little chores for the Uni-
versity magazine when in walks
the Faculty Advisor to Student
Publications. “Hiya, 'Paul,” I
yelled. He threw a letter on my
desk and walked ;out. “So long,
Paul,” I yelled. Itlis this type of
intimate relationship between ad-

‘ministration and student which

will better prepare me for my
future role in either labor or man-
agement. I turned my attention

. to the letter.

It was a letter from some 0!-
ganization in New York which
was sponsoring a national beauty
contest to select Miss American
Coed of 1949. The letter went on
to explain that the Miss Ameri-
can Coeds of 1947 were wined and
dined in rather a lavish manner
along the vast, sandy stretches of
Florida,‘ or somewhere like that.
The letter next stated that the 10
ﬁnalists of the Miss American Co-
eds’ contest of 1948 fared even
better.

Perry Como and Jo Stafford
teamed up to show the ten lovelies
New York plus guesting them on
the Chesterﬁeld Supper Club. Al-
so, a couple, editors of the pic-
ture magazine, Life, contributed
a double or triple page spread to
these intelligent college kids who
were also pretty.

Maybe She's Here

This. organization,’ after giving
us the build—up,'-‘wanted to know
if the Panther Magazine would
run a sort of beauty contest here
at.-old U of Pandisort of send

along to their offices in New York, '

two -8x10 photographs of our ﬁn-
alist and "semi-ﬁnalists in our own
locally-conducted show‘ so that
they might be entered in the na-
tional judging. I burped.

The excitement was too much
for m.e.

Maybe~our -own, dear Sheila
Shultz, Junior, Class of ’52, ver-
star, College,
‘English ' major, advertising minor
and guard at Western Psyche
could win this contest. My
thoughts were jumbled with the
possibilities. Fame and glory to
Pitt. Smoky City girl wins. A pic-

ture of the Cathedral, tall, state- ,

ly, majestically, cloud-haloed on
the cover of Life. I leaped to my
desk top_ singing, “Hail to “Pitt”

spaced at every third bar with’

the Marseilles, to give it rhythm.
I was carried away—to the office
of the Editor of the Pitt News.

“You can’t run that type of
contest,” the editor said. I swore
an oath at him. Then reconsidering
his power ‘to hire and ﬁre, I ask-
“Why?” mildly. “You just
can’t,?’ he said, “it’s against the
policy of the school.” I put a
couple. and a couple together and
got four. “What is a contest that
is in accord with the policy of the
school?” I asked myself. Senior

' Queen, of course.

A Beauty Contest? Horrors

Although this is not strictly a
contest there is a winner and a
loser. To come out on top-of the
heap it is necessary for the girl
to have superior intelligence, per-
sonality plus, be voted in by her
fellow students, and be interest-
ed in school activities like mad.
This is not a beauty contest. If
the Queen happens to be pretty
so much the better; if not, let it
be said that she hath personality
and can dance. ‘

But what about Miss Average
Intelligence_ here at the Univer-
sity who happens to be ‘just as

‘cute as frost on a penguin’s belly.

Won’t she ever have a chance to
win anything? The editor says,
“no,” administration says, “no,"
and Charlie, the elevator operator,
says, “no.” Long, live the queen
and may the Tele run it on page
one. We have a chick here, who
might have made it, LIFE.

PIA Constitution Amendments
List Officer. Quorum Changes

The Constitution of the Pitt Independent Association has under-
gone amendments to its sections on the number and nomination of
officers, and on the number representing a quorum.

They were brought up at a gen- ¢

eral meeting last Friday because
of the “binding clauses” of the
Constitution, according to Bill
Tarleton, president of the PIA.

The clause providing for 15
elected general council members
has been changed to 15 members
or 20% of the entire membership,
whichever is smaller.

A minimum of 30 candidates at
each election has been changed to
a minimum of twice as many can-
didates as offices open.

Replacing the minimum of 50
members necessary for a quorum
is the amendment of two-_thirds
of_ the entire membership plus one
necessary to carry on business.

At present PIA is making plans
for its skating party, April 4,
which will be open to the entire
student body.

In Management

A miniature graduation cere-
mony will take place today, when
24 representatives of local, na-
tional, and foreign industries re-
ceive their certiﬁcates of attain-
ment in a course on “Management
Problems for Executives” given
by the University.

By means» of both research and
case studies, E. C. Stone, professor
of transportation at Pitt and co‘-
ordinator of the course, has at-
tempted to train the men not only

to perform their present duties_

more efficiently but to be prepared
for advancement and progress
within their companies.

The men, chosen. by their re-
spective companies for training
because of their qualities of abil-
ity, leadership, and adaptability,
began their training Feb. 14 and
since have studied and lived as a

group.

Singers Visit Mon City Tonight
To Serenade Masonic Group

Pitt Singers, the choral group that would "‘rather sing than
eat,” will head for Monongahela City tonight to serenade the Royal

Arch Chapter of the Masons.

The concert will feature a variety of ‘music. Specialty numbers
such as “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and a Fred Waring arrange-
ment of “Comin’ Through the Rye” will feature the Singers’ pro-

gram.

Singers are the youngest choral
re.cruits on campus. Originally
slated for a small choir compos-
ed of women from Women’s Chor-
al and men from Men’s Glee Club.
they have branched out consider-
ably to their full chorus of over
ﬁfty voices. Their tag, “rather
sing than eat,” stems from the
fact that they rehearse on lunch
hour—12:30 to 1:30 p. In.

Special features for tonight’s
concert will be the Women’s Chor-
al Trio, Mary Kreps, Hope Ruma,
and Beverley Schmidt, duets by
Tom Lieper and Mary Emma
Hirsch, and incidental solos by
Ethel Childs, Tony Puccini, and
Lieper. Marion Moeslak will ac-
company the group.

Coming: Grady's

Girl Review

By
MYRON KOPELMAN

There is no substantial reason why Pitt athletic contests
should not be ﬂavored with feminine. cheerleaders, says Mr.
.Morton Lerner, long the champion of athletics in our student
governing bodies. Lerner has proposed that Student Congress
recommend that the Athletic Director take down the “Men

Only” sign.
“Girls have something that
male cheerleaders just don’t have,"
declared Congressman Lerner.
“What?” inquired a reporter.
’ “Well-l—l-l—l, they just have a
way of leading cheers‘ . . .”
“How?” the reporter wanted to
know.
‘Hard to- Describe’
- “It’s kind of hard to describe,”
writhed Morton, “All I know is

that I saw the girl who leads

I . liked what I
saw. She really
brought the

“Now I am
not in favor of

c h e e r leaders

he continued.‘ “What I want is
athletic females. However, it
would be up to Ben Grady, who
is _in charge of the cheerleaders,
to decide on the qualiﬁcations and
pick the best women.”

It’s a shame that such a fate
may befall a nice guyplike Grady.
Ben has led a very calm exist-
ence here at Pitt, just going about
his job of tutoring a bunch of big

that the snippy little blonde over

can.
Mean Old Grady '

Then the ﬁrst party is going to
say that that mean old Ben Grady
fell for the cheap blonde just be-
cause she ﬂashed a tricky eye.

But Ben reportedly says he does
not mind the dangers of the job,

if it ‘is for thegood of the school. 

Miss Audrey Westerman, an-
other member of Student Con-
gress, expressed the opinion,,how-
ever, that any girl who would be
a
high type woman. And the Con-
gresswoman may have something
there.

It is probably true that female
cheerleaders covet their jobs be-
cause they think that all themen
have their eyes on them. Trouble
is, they’re‘right.

At any rate, it is going to be
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
who will have to investigate the
virtues and weaknesses of ‘Pitt
womanhood, for it is he Whomust
