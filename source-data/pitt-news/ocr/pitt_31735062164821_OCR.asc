Dr. Meyers announced that in
all’ probability the Chancellor will
be back at the University by La-
bor Day. In the intervening
weeks; he will spend time in the
Caribbean and at his farm in
northern Pennsylvania.

The Chancellor stated that Dr.
Crawford’s, appointment is in ac-

normal practice of rotating such
responsibilites among members
of his administration when he is
out of the country. ’

A eral past occassions. He isjone of

the -“senior men” in the Univer-

versity in 1926. He has been
with the University ever since.

Hogan, SG ‘vice president,

by Hogan this trimester is the

"“near vacuum of SG officials on

it hard for SG to remain active.

Chamber of  
Commerce

Favors Aid

The Greater Pittsburgh Chain-
ber of Commerce joined local
and county officials Tuesday in
recommending that the state
Council of Higher Education ap-
-prove the University's request for
$5 million in emergency state aid.

The chairman of the council,

Charles Simpson, received this

recommendation in a letter from
Henry Avery, the president of
the Chamber of Commerce.

Avery argued that the Univer-
sity should not be forced to aban-
don its programs or lose its staff
and faculty because of lack of
funds. He went on to comment
that the University’s growth dur-
ing the last ten years has given
.an added dimension to the.renais-

Project Studies March

By PETER KENENY
What makes 118 students
leave the University on a
few hours notice and go to
Alabama to participate in a

‘civil rights march? This is,

in part, the question that
Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associate
professor of sociology, is trying
to answer inhis current study.‘

Dr. Berkowitz stated that the
official purpose of his project is
“to comp.are the students who

went to Montgomery with the
" faveraige’ student

ling from the local colleges which
were involved in the march.

. The. research done was exten-
sive. Questionnaires were sent to
all of the students All of the
adults and ‘40 of the students,
mainly the leaders, were inter-
viewed for an average oi.’ three
to four hours. Dr. Berkowitz has
also compiled, with the aid of
over. 20 ‘students, every article,
photo and tape dealing ‘with the
incident. \

Council Admits Need

By  REHNS

The state Council on Higher Education recognized a"i_
“real, current, urgent need” for funds at the University—:‘
after its study onvt-he campus Wednesday. Charles Simpson,

chairman of the Council, promised to relay this need to

Governor William Scranton and felt certain that he Would
“make some commitment, but only after further study}?

The study was conducted to determine the University's 
need for the emergency'_$5 million in aid it has requested .

from the state. Gwilym Price, chairman of the University’s Board of. ,_ I 

Trustees, indicated that one-half of the sum is needed ‘before July

31 and one-quarter by the “27, 28, or 29 of June for the payroll.”-‘ ,0 _5;.-:__—-.,.:

In acknowledging that “there is no basis for challenging the
$5 million request” and that the “state has to aid" the University,

Simpson cautioned that before a ﬁnal recommendation can be ‘made,
the Council is “obliged to review the annual appropriations to the Uni- ~

versity and the 15 other private area colleges that receive stateaid.”
- He explained that the Council “knows little about the University

and its problems” because. formerly Pennsylvania had no educational 9
plan. “It is_ a sad fact of life that we have to start from scratch to de-  V

termine a basis for judgment” of the requests, he said.

Council members felt that the Governor “should do everything V 
‘to help” not just because of the University’s needs .as an institution -
but also because of its importance in the education of the citizens, _
of Greater Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. ‘

Simpson saw a series of statements to the Governor as the ﬁrsti

step to “aid the University and ourselves.” These statements would,

 

spark “in 30-, 60, or 90 days” more intensive study of the University’s , 

academic offerings, plans for the future, .and fiscal needs. (The Coun-

cil had only conducted a brief tour of the University grounds and

facilities). . .
' Price expressed his gratitude for the “encouraging words”‘ but
declared that the University “would return to Simpson, if there is
not something deﬁnite enough by the end of June to be bankable.”
Simpson explained thatva great deal can be done with letters

of intent or formal written declarations. He said that the state has a_

deﬁnite interest in the needs of the University and should make a.
commitment to help it. He did not know if such a commitment neces--

. sitated legislative action. t p
Simpson felt that the opinion of the Council and the previously ‘

expressed (attitude of the governor “add ‘up to an optimistic picture”

although he was not permitted ‘to make a commitment before going .

to the state Board of Education.

Price expressed the hope that the letters of intent, which .imp- 0,’
son expected to be before the Board of Education by July 4, would‘,
help the University to get a bank loan. ' , 

, In response to a question concerning any alteration ‘of the, Uni.-
versity‘s affiliation "with the state, .._Simpson could foresee ‘only, ‘fa
good change inrelationsh-ip_. The affiliation must be viewedin terms.

diforial I A. I ,  s T,

I The reaction of the state Council on Higher Education
to the University’s request for a $5 mi1110I1 aDPf'0D1‘1a_t10T1
from the state-was very favorable. .The. Council decided
that there is‘ a definite need here and that the state should
help. the University. Charles Simpson, Chalrman Of the
‘Council, expects to have at least an informal “letter of

intent” in time for the-University to meet its Payroll and
other operating expenses at the end of the month.

 ,

, The announcement before the Council by Gwilym Price,
I "chairman of the Board of Trustees, concerning the immedi-.
’ ate-urgency of the University’s request raised some inter-
 esting questions——questions which must be answered re-
‘ gardless of whether or not the University get the money
" in time.. Assuming that the quality of the University’s comp-
-trolling and auditing staff is somewhat comparable to its
‘quantity, it seems very odd that despite the fact that the
~ situation is‘ so desperate, the University did not recognize
' the need to ask thestate for money until June 6, only three
. weeks short of the day that the University would be $1,250,-
' I 000 short of meeting its payroll demands.

Acting Chancellor Stanton‘ Crawford exlﬂained. Of
A’ ‘ _course, that the University has been aware of the need for
some time, and that only the publicity about the state of
the ﬁnancial affairs was new. He also pointed out that
a _‘‘friends’’ of the University in the legislature have been
' ’ aiding the cause all year long, and therefore t-he $5 million
request was not a sign of ‘last-minute recognition of the
seriousness of the situation.

Even this explanation is not sufficient __to explain the
delay in asking for state aid. The presence of legislative
.‘_‘friends” may help pick up a few drops in the bucket, but
nothing in the neighborhood of $5 million. It seems almost
 impossible that such a large shortage could not have been
seen or admitted earlier so that more time could have been
devoted to trying to make it up. ‘

Simpson stated that there was no resentment on the
part of the Council because they were brought in so late.
_ The University can consider itself lucky to find such a sym-

" pathetic ear“aZt ‘this late date. '

The Aftermath ofa Column

In my last column I at-
tacked Chancellor Litchfield
for not attempting to deter-
mine student opinion on the
possibility of the Univers-
ity’s becoming a state-affili-
ated institution. The events
which followed the appear-
ance of that column restored
my faith in half of the a-d-_
ministration: the younger,
lower - echelon administrat-
ors. Within two days after
the paper was out, however,

  two of the
most ‘import-
ant older,
higher - eche-
lon adminis-
trators had
me in their
offices to tell

    

 

wrong with
my column
and how I

 

FRIEDMAN

was unfair to the Chancel-‘
- lor. '

Admittedly, I was called
into these offices to discuss
other matters, but neither
of the administrators pass-
ed up the opportunityto tell
me how I had overreached
myself. They also pointed
out that the column was in
very poor taste since it ap-
peared in the same issue
which contained notice of
the Chancellor’s ‘heart at-
tack. The fact that his at-
tack was announced the
night before the paper came
out while the column had

been written almost one .
week earlier did not impress ‘

these administrators at all.
After all, they both pointed
out, ‘the very fact that the
Chancellor suffered a heart
attack proves that he is

. working very, very hard.

In my column, I never
said he didn’t .work hard.
In fact, I’ said that he was
so busy that he didn’t have
time to have an interview
with The Pitt News. It was

' this. point that the adminis-

tration felt:-was the most un-
fair. If the students are un-
able to find out the Chancel-
lor’s view, they asked, what

me what was .

right‘ do I have to say that
he is not tryin.g to determine
ours? I am sure that they
could not have really believ-
ed in such a naive, simplistic
objection.

Nobody who hasever been»

interviewed, and both of
these administrators have
been many times, can possi-
bly believe that during an
interview, information, in-
terests, and concerns travel
in ony one direction. It would
be impossible for the C-han-
cellor not to be able to de-

' termine what aspects of the
University-state relationship '

most interested and troub-
led the students. '

Assuming‘ that these ad-
ministrators really do believe
t-hat an interview is a one-
way street, they cannot even
defend that one direction.
Dr. Robert Bailie, the Chan-
cellor’s assistant, said that
the Chancellor’s schedule
was full, and after asking
for a sample question, told
us that we could get our in-
formation from public rela-
tions. When we called pub-
lic relations, however, they
told us that they did not
have the information we
wanted and that they did not
believe it was available.

The information which we
requested concerns distribu-
tion of budget funds. It is
not classified or conﬁdential.
It is simply not the kind of
information which the pub-
lic relations office would be
expected to have. Questions
of this nature can only be
answered, if at all, by the
Chancellor.

The defensively innocent
attitude of these higher ad-
ministrators was in direct
contrast to that of the
younger, lower-level admin-
istrators. The ﬁrst one whom

I spoke to told me that I had ‘ ‘

said what definitely needed
to be said and that he was
very glad I had written it.
Forgobvious reasons he add-
ed that if I said anything
about administrative com-
ment, would I please omit

his name. Another told me
that my column reflected a
growing force on campuses
across the country-, and that
the upper administrators
here were refusing to face
modern reality. -

For the benefit of certain
sensitive administrators I
would like to make clear the
following: I never said that
the Chancellor never talks
to the students; I never said
that the administration nev-
er works with the students.
There was too much cooper-
ation between the students
and the administration this
wholeyear to believe other-
wise. I merely said, and I
still believe, that we the stu-
dentsshould at least be
questioned concerning our
attitudes toward a possible
move which would change
the University completely-—
not an unreasonable request.

CIA Focus
Of Midday

Haynes Johnson presented his
analysis of the Central_ Intelli-
gence Agency (CIA) to the
Largest midday crowd of the tri-
mester Wednesday. '

Johnson explained that his
concern with the workings of the
CIA began when he was a grad-
uate student in history. He has
since concluded that the CIA has
too much autonomy and no con-
trol.

Johnson described in detail the
interior of the “hidden” CIA
building, calling special attention

to the inscription ,“and ye shall _

know the truth and the truth
shall make ye free.” To Johnson,
“these words -are the ﬁnal jest

in the never-never-land of our 1

commenting, pointing out that the

_ formation concerning the meet.-
‘ing, and adding “I’d much pre-

fer you talk to the administra-
tion.” ~ I _

When questioned concerning
the great urgency and immediate
need for such a large sum of
money, Dr. Stanton Crawford,
.newly-appointed acting chancel-
lor, explained that the Universi-
ty had known previously of the
problems that were. arising, and
that only “the publicity (sur-

rounding the problem) was sud- ,
‘den, not the problem.”

Requests for aid to the Univer-
sity had been made to the state
before public announcement of
such activitiy, he said. These
overtures were made not only
by the University itself, but also
by its “friends”.in the legisla-
ture, who _have worked on vari-
ous bills to aid the University.

The ‘whole matter, he con-
cluded, is very involved and com-
plicated. ’

He declined to answer further
questions concerning the .activ-
ities ‘of the Board, pointing out

that Price is the only spokesman, ~

and “if he didn’t want to tell
you, there’s not much I can say.”

New Mississippi Freedom Party ,

Focus of Rights 'Worker’s Speech

By FRED N. FRANK ,

.41.; Civil rights worker
I Charles Springer ,claims't_oo
many ;.people think the re-
cent voting rights bill pass-
ed by Congress will “solve
everything in Mississippi.”
Springer, who is a graduate assis-
tant in chemistry at the Universi-
‘ ty, spoke "at a meeting of the
 school’s NAACP Thursday night.
i Springer felt that the voting
r ' '_ rights bill is not the answer to
the problem, because local offi-
cials will still not administrate ‘it
properly. On the other hand
Springer pointed out that the
Mississippi Freedom Democratic
-Party (MFDP) is a force that is
“cracking the Racist wa1l.” .
The MFDP claims that- the
elections held in Mississippi last
November were in violation of
the Constitution and are there-
fore void. , They therefore feel
that the Mississippi Congressmen
should not be seated because of

the illegality of their election.
Last May, over 15,000 pages, of
evidence showing nearly total
Negro disenfranchisement in
Mississippi were submitted, to the

Clerk of the House of Representa-
tives. Springer discussed the evi-
dence still under consideration
by the Clerk of the House.

and reconstructed the march.
They also interviewed the'woman
who was in charge of the Ben-
more- Hotel while the students
were there and asked her if she
saw signs_ of any “illicit activ-
ities.” The answer was no.

Even thoughethe analysis will
not be complete until September,
Dr. Berkowitz has been able to
answer many of the questions
and doubts that have surrounded

i the demonstrations. One of his
’ ﬁrmest convictions is that they
did'not go for “kicks.”

Dr. Berkowitz felt that there
are a lot of easier ways to get
thrills. He concluded that it is
unlikely that ten per cent of the

students were motivated by the—

Fort Lauderdale spirit. “The stu-
dents who went are "political and
social activists. Such an attitude
would be incongrous with the

personalities of -such people,” he _

said. ‘

So far several facts about the .

students are apparent, Dr. Berko-
witz commented:

> They are better students.
Their QPA’s are higher.

5 The demonstrators were con-‘
centrated in the liberal arts.’

>The percentage of Jewish
and Catholic participants was
disproportionately high. ‘

>Of those who went, a high
percentage do not claim their
parents’ faith. '
