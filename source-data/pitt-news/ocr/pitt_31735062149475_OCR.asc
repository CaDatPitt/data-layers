Refugee Aid

Committee
Selects
Executives

Dannies, Ryden,
Goldstein, F our
Others to Serve

By Robert Adams
(See editorial, page two)

Members of the committee of
33 student activity leaders at-
tempting to provide for European
refugee students at the Univer-
sityselected an executive com1nit-
tee and discussed plans of action
at their first meeting Wednesday af-
ternoon.

Taking the first step toward per-
manent organization, the group elect-
ed to its executive committee Robert
Dannies, BA39; Kenneth Ryden,
C39; and Lea Goldstein, C39.

To complete the executive com-
mittee of seven members, one rep-
resentative will be designated by
each of four campus organizations-
Student-Faculty Association, Inter-
fraternity Council, Panhellenic
Council, and The News.

Group Decides Policy

These organizations will name
their representatives to the execu-
tive committee within the next
week. The executive committee will
then direct the activities of the stu-
dent group in its attempt to main-
tain at the University student vic-
tims of foreign intolerance.

After expressing general agree-
ment that University students would
support the movement under way in
over 47 colleges throughout the na-
tion, to provide for foreign refugee
students, the committee discussed
possible plans for the University
campaign. It was decided that de-
tails of the project must be worked
out by the executive committee.

Prominent Students

The new members of the executive
committee have been prominent in
leadi.ng campus activities. Dannies,
varsity football center and high
honor student, is a member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, men’s national
ionorary activities fraternity. He
was chairman of the 1938 Interim-
ternity Yuletide Festival, and a mem-
ber of Men’s Council for two years.
He is a member of Phi Delta Theta
social fraternity.

Ryden, star hurdler on the Uni-
versity track team, and honor stu-
dent in journalism, is also a mem-
ber of ODK. Miss Goldstein is a
member of Pi Tau Phi, scholastic
honorary in The College, and has
been active in women’s activ'.i‘.ties
groups.

Engineering
AIMME President Emphasizes
Value of Practical Work in Field

By Jack Brady

“Engineering is learned after you
leave college,” explained Dr. D. C.
Jackling, president of the American
Institute of Mining and Metallur-
gical Engineers, at a meeting of stu-
dents and members of the institute
Wednesday in Stephen Foster Me-
Inorial.

“Foundations of engineering are
learned during school, but if you
continue to use the same formula as
developed by other men, and exact-
ly along the same lines as used by
other men in solving problem—then
you will never be a success,” said
Dr. Jackling.

With regard to an institution’s ad-
vantages to students, “it has intensi-
fied its efforts to give younger mem-
bers the maximum service at a min-
imum cost. The student who takes
advantage of these opportunities re-
ceives more from the institution than
what he can possibly give it, from
monetary support or technical
knowledge,” Dr. Jackling asserted.

He believes that the ﬁeld of phys-
ical metallurgy offers more oppor-
tunities than ever before and that
recent developments have scarcely
dented the surface.

Dr, Jackling after many years of
research has perfected a copper
vacuum that will remove the copper
content of ore down to six-tenth
percent. He believes the same thing
is possible with iron ore.

The president-elect tof the insti-
tute, Mr. D. B. Gillies, believes that
“great men. men of research, are
the men who accomplish and do
things and set the pace for the rest
of us, and Dr. Jackling is one of
those men.”

begin with an opening worship
service in Heinz Chapel at 4
o’clock Sunday, according to Dr.
Iierbert L. Spencer, president of
Pennsylvania -College for Women,

lution of modern problems by rein-
terpreting Christianity in the light of
modern knowledge and events.”

Subjects Varied

Although Campus Conference

and marriage. Attorney Frank W.

Conference is a campus-wide project,
and is not sponsored by any one or-
ganization, but rather through the
cooperation of all.

Luncheons Planned

“This Conference is an undertak-
ing of unprecedented proportions,"
he said. “It is our sincere hope that
as many students as can, will place
it ahead of other activities during
the week.”

Lunch for men student leaders on
Monday at 12:30 o’clock will open
the activities at the University. A
faculty luncheon at which Dr. John
Mackay, president of Princeton
Theological Seminary, is speaker

We Take Exception
To Our ‘Fan lﬂail’

UR “In the Mail” column, located elsewhere on

this page, contains an interesting letter. It is

so interesting, in fact, that we broke one of our
strictest regulations in printing it.

Ordinarily, letters which come to the editor’s
desk unsigned usually make a rapid detour to the
editor’s wastebasket-. Thus today ’s little note,
signed merely “Members of the (Dental School)
Junior Class,” would, under ordinary conditions,
encounter the same fate.

I But its contents were such as to make as waive
all journalistic rules and regulations. For here
was a crystallized, concise version of the universal
complaint which has been voiced on scattered sec-
tions of the campus regarding the current plan to
aid student refugees.

So, even though we still wish these mysterious
“Members of the Junior Class” would have been
forthright enough to sign their names, a11d thus re- -
move all doubt that they are representative of the
entire class group, we can’t pass up this oppor-
tunity to do a bit of plain speaking on our own ac-
count. .

By this time, the “Charity begins at home”
bromide has become the chief (and seemingly only)
argument of the opponents of the refugee drive.
As says the particular letter to which we refer,
“. . why go across the seas when we have here in
our own country students far more worthy of our

aid?”

=1‘ * #

Asking us that question is somewhat like bring-
ing up the old one about, “Have you stopped beat-
ing your wife?” VVe answer, of course, that the
need among American students is great; yet at the
same time we must justify our plan to provide for
refugees.

The Pitt News has always championed the cause
of the American student, has continually pointed
out the existing equalities and lack of opportunity
which exist among our students “here in our ow11
country”—a policy, incidentally, for which we
have at times been criticized.

Supporting such measures as the American
Youth Act (which many of our present critics
would, no doubt, term “radical” although it would
go far toward achieving their announced ideals, and
extension of the NYA; supporting wholeheartedly
campaigns of standing campus organizations to
provide student loan funds and similar projects;
quick to push any plan which would help better
student conditions, The News feels that it‘ has not
shut its eyes to local realities.

But we realize that this is a long-range cam-
paign, that advances are slowly but steadily being
made, that no one campaign could, by the immense
nature of the problem and its immediate and col-
orless aspect, have very telling results.

On the other hand, we now ﬁnd ourselves con-
fronted with an immediate pr0blem—an emergency,
if you will. Many young men and women of other
countries of superior intellectual capacity have
been denied the right to pursue their education be-
cause of Fascist and totalitarian oppression and
intolerance.

\Vc can now make our little contribution towards
alleviating an unfortunate situation from the hu-
man point of view—by what has been termed “a
very altruistic and worthy plan.” And we can, at
the same time, by bringing here students of supe-
rior standing, make a deﬁnite contribution to the
student body and University.

*

* 3?

Contrary to many opinions, we do not plan a
wholesale migration of refugees to the Pitt campus.
Only a few can be helped with their education, by
a drive of moderate proportions. And the drive,
being participated in by Protestant, Catholic, and
Jewish students alike, is not limited to German
refugees, but may include any students forced to
give up their studies because of internal condi-
tions within their countries.

\Ve appreciate the sincerity of most of those who
have voiced this complaint. In some cases, how-
ever we suspect a more basic, underlying reason.

And we have been rather overwhelmed by this
sudden deluge of “charity begins at home” human-
itarianism, coming, in some instances, in quarters
which have previously given the matter little
thought and less action.

We are extremely sorry The News cannot have
the support of the Junior Class of the Dental
school. \Ve feel confident, however, that despite
this major defection from the ranks, plans to aid
refugees will proceed with the aid of most of the
leading students and faculty members of the Uni-
Versity.

Brown Reviews
Muenzer Recital

By Robert Brown

A large audience, including a liberal sprinkling of
ﬁddlers of high and low degree, heard the recital of Hans
Muenzer, violinist, and Esther Payne Muenzer, pianist,
in the Foster Hall auditorium last Wednesday afternoon.

The program was made up of the E Flat sonata of
Richard Strass, Edouard Lalo’s “Symphony Espag—
nole,” and a group of shorter numbers by Sarasate,
Wieniawski, and Brahms. Mrs. Muenzer played two
Brahms numbers, a short Intermezzo and the justly
famous Rapsody, Opus 79, No. 1.

‘One of Best’ in Local Season

Mr. Muenzer has been hailed by some critics as a
“second Heifetz.” He is decidedly not that. But he is
certainly one of the best violinists to hit Pittsburgh this
season. He possesses a ﬁne, silky tone in the upper
register, and has absolute command of his instrument
in respect to double stopping, ﬁageolet tones, and bow-
mg.

The Lalo Concerto was Mr. Muenzer’s piece, and he
made the most of it. It is pretty much of a showpiece.
but, unlike most works of its class, it has real musical
value. Mr. Muenzer approached it intelligently, using
a good, rough attack when the music demanded it and
making his ﬁddle sing in the cantalina passages. The
little scherzo was perfect.

I thought that the programming of the Strauss sonata
was a mistake. It is an early work, and is a strange
mixture of counterpoint, German lieder, and orchestral
effects. The ﬁrst movement contains a rapturous
theme reminiscent of the great tone poems that followed
after the sonata, broken up long winded passages that
mean very little. The second movement, titled Im-
provization, is a beautiful thing, grateful to both instru-
ments, and it gave Mr. Muenzer a ﬁne chance to do his
stuff on the E string, supported by a gently rocking ar-
peggio accompaniment from the piano. The last move-
ment is clearly the work of a schoolman, a letdown
after the breathless quality of the preceding andante—
sound and fury, and not much more.

Brahms Interpretation ‘Impressive’

The concluding numbers were tossed off with ease,
and Mr. Muenzer made these technical ﬁights sound in-
teresting and exciting.

Esther Payne Muenzer proved herself to be much
more than an intelligent accompanist with her playing
of the two pieces by Brahms. Too many pianists turn
Brahms’ sonority into hazy blobs of sound. With a
clear attack and sparing use of the pedal she gave the
great Rhapsody an impressive interpretation.

The Muenzers’ program was devoted entirely to num-
bers by the late romantics. To give the audience a full
rounded idea of their capabilities, they might have
scheduled a sonata by one of the great classicists the
calibre of Vivaldi or Bach or Mozart. It would have
been interesting to see if Mr. Muenzer could have cut
down on his tone to give pieces of this order the clear,
concise treatment they require.

I’m just smooth. A junior, “By gosh I can’t understand '

The Question:

What is your opinion of the
current student refugee drive
which is being organized by The
News and leading Campus or-
ganizations?

The Answers:
Emil Naric, BA40:

I think the move on “refugees”
which is being conducted on campus
is in keeping with the forward prog-
ress of the University. It is compara-
ble with the progressive step in ath-
letics (that of our being connected in-
directly with the “Big Ten”).

Caryl Covert, BA40:
 There are too many Americans

that could be taken care of.
Chas. Bradley, CE42:

I think the drive is all right but
the money raised
by such‘ a drive
could probably be
used just as well
here for our own
students.

 =l= =1:
Robert G. Thomp-
son, C41:

I think it’s all
right to help
those who are
less fortunate
than we.

I think the
country will
beneﬁt in the

long run by “importing” intellectu-
als and I believe the cormnittee is
making the proper move.

* *

Andrew Marshall, BA43:

It's a move in the right direction.
The only trouble will probably be
in raising the funds. However I
don”: think it will be too great a
problem for I think the people out-
side the University will assist for
there has been a deﬁnite American
expression of sympathy for refugees.
Jimmy Baldwin, BA40:

I am glad to see humanitarian
ideas are not entirely over-clouded
by racial prejudice.

I believe that the movement it-
self is one that certainly should fos-
ter a better understanding of the
different peoples in a world of con-
flict. ,,

Gene Pyle, C41:

I think it’s a marvelous movement.
When one considers the ultimate
value of an education it should be
clear what a worthwhile project this
is; a project that should be given
great consideration by the University.

Olive Larson, Ed39:

It sounds good to me provided
the students are those on a high
intelligence level.

Pat Cooney, L40:

I think the campaign is a positive
expression of the American ideal of
tolerance.

It shows that the University is
willing to take its place along with
other schools such as Harvard and
Northwestern.

Brooks Sipes, C39:

Let’s bring some poor Pittsburgh-
ers to the University.

This drive appears to me to be a
duplicate of the missionary situa-
tion—missionaries going to China
to Christianize the Chinese while
50 per cent of Americans are not
Church members.

John Todd, E41:
I think it would be much better for
us to help students in our own coun-
try rather than European refugees.
There are many students in our Uni-
versities who are forced to withdraw
from school because of ﬁnancial con-
ditions.

Editor. Pitt News
Dear Sir:

In response to your appeal for the

fforming of a scholastic fund, where-
’ by G:‘.rm-.‘».n Refugees might be helped
no secure an education at the Uni-
§\‘e1*sity. let me give you the reac-
' non of ihc Junior Class at the Dent-

al School.

It is granted that it is a very altru-
istic and worthy plan. But why go.
across the seas when we have here
in our own country, students far‘
more worthy of our aid? Race, creed»
or color does not enter into the con-
sideration of this question. Who,.
might we ask has a better right to-
appeal to our generosity than our
own citizens, many of whom have-
been, ﬁnancially, just as hard hit as.
have the refugees?

Therefore, we as a body do not
endorse such a plan and cannot feel
obligated in any way.

Sincerely,
Members of the Junior Class.

7 All the Latest and Most

From the
Shoulder

 

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

John Lorenzo Griﬁith, impressive all the way from the bottom of
his argoyle-plaid socks to the top of his well-combed grey hair, sat in
the easy chair of his \Villiam Penn hotel room yesterday morning, and
puffed. . , _

Major Griffith, who serves as the Commissioner of the Big Ten
Conference, was in town for the day and the village ’s newsgatlierers
had come to sit at his feet. for the purpose of enlightenment. They
wanted to have some deﬁnite word on the local athletic realm ’s most
pressing problem. That is, the meaning of the University ’s entangling
alliance with the \Vestern Conference. Major Griffith was puffing on
his pipe.

As the man who runs the Conference, Major Griffith is the one
who knows most about its inner mechanisms, quite naturally He rep-
resents it to the public. He is, in reality, the central office, the sym-
bol of unity. His word on the recent Big 'l‘en cooperative extension
‘was therefore, eagerly awaited.

‘Anything Can Happen,’ Says Major

VVas Pitt to become a member of the Conference? Certain well-
informed football writers of national stature had indicated that this
was a foregone conclusion in the acceptance of the Panthers into
the non-official Big Ten fold. \Vei-e certain members, namely Chicago
and Indiana on the verge of dropping out?

\Vliat was Major Griffith’s personal opinion on the matter‘.«’

\Vell, Major Griffith, couldn’t exactly say. First of all, he didn’t
have the authority to change the personnel himself, so what differ-
ence did his opinion inake. Secondly, in the Conference inner
sanctuins no change in the membership had ever been discussed. And
in the third place, “There is a general sentiinent among the members
of the Conference that the group is large enough.” \Vhich, in brief,
added up to the fact that Major Griffith didii’t exactly say that Pitt
was coming into the group, soon or ever. But, after being considera-
bly pressed, he did admit, “Anything can happen.” . . . What down
is it?

Since there was nothing but uncertainty attached to the ques-
tion of to whether or not the University will ever be plunked into
the midst of the Big Ten, the matter of how Pitt and the brothers in
the Conference would function in their new-found fellowship became
a point of interrogation. This brought out a further expounding of
the Big Ten procedure by the Major to the effect that when one school
heard something nasty about another it reported the ugly word to the
commissioner who informed the defendant or who, after investigation,
corrected the accuser. The Big ’l‘en office will do the same for Pitt,
the Major explained.

Major Puffs — Questions Remain Questions

Now, why did the Big Ten pick on Pitt, of all the eligible schools
in the country? VVhy was the Big Ten going to be Pitt ’s fairy god-
mother? Certainly, the Big Ten public face meant a lot to the prestige
of the Panthers, but what did it do for the Big Ten? If the Big Ten
wasn’t taking the Panthers into membership, what was it doing with
them ‘.2

“First,” said the Major, as he puffed, “this will help create bet-
ter feelings in inidwestern football. And secondly, in the next few
years the lines will be drawn closer between those who are righteous
and those who are not.” This was the Major ’s verbatim answer as to
why Pitt had been given this cooperative agreement . . . \Vho’s got
the ball, now?

VVell, how could Pitt be considered on a parity with the Big Ten?
Most of the Big Ten schools were state institutions whose tuition was
only a fraction of that paid at Pitt. Pitt is a school of commuters, the
Big Ten schools are schools of boarders. “Chicago and Northwestern
are not state institutions,” replied the Major.

Finally, Pitt’s code is much more stringent than the VVestern
Conference rulings, isn’t it? “Yes, Pitt has a very good code,” ob-
served the Major.

The Major had a press conference—so what?

basketball tactics, 41 to 22.

In 16-cylinder fashion the Law-
ther students worked the ball under
the Blue and Gold hoop for short
shots with monotonous regularity.

A heretofore unknown quantity —
sophomore Sapp—was State’s most
determined passer, ringing in five
field goals and three fouls for a
neat total of 13 points. The men
from Nittany muffed only once at
the charity line, converting 15 out
of 16 free tries.

State’s freshman gave a vest-
pocket preview of what was to be
seen in height and heft, on their
varsity, as they went down before
Paul Zehfus’ undefeated yearlings,
35-27.

George Kocheran was the only
sobering influence in the local line-
up. Pitt did not revert to early sea-
son form—it was much worse than
that. Not one Panther cleared the
nets for more than two goals. That
the boys from State were not aller-
gic to body contact, was evidenced
by their unflinching dribbles through
Pitt’s rough but ineffective defense.

Dr. Carlson’s Jungle Cats were at
their tamest and Professor Lawther’s
well-architectured Nittany Lions
were at their savage peak. Theiout-
come was never in doubt, and the
victors held a handsome lead at the
intermission, 17-9. State, sporting
an 18 point advantage near the close
of the game, continued to whack
away point-mad at the Panther buck-
et, while Pitt’s late rush went prac-
tically nowhere in a scoring way.

Tomorrow evening the Carlsonmen
take part in a double basketball bill
at Convention Hall, Philadelphia,
when they engage Jimmy Usilton’s
Temple Owls in a Conference tilt.

Temple’s Eastern champions of last
year are not of championship cal-

Pitt’s unambitious par. Usilton lost
a wealth of material in the last
graduation ceremonies. Only three

experienced floormen—-Boyle, Hen-
derson and Black—have returned to
the Owl squad.

Temple and Pitt both have out-
side chances of winding up near the
Eastern Conference winner, and if
the Philadelphians take a new lease

escape a hangover, they might ser_ve
up a real ball game.

Phi Cams Lose
To Phi Delt Five
In Upset, 32-26

Duke university has the sympa-
thies of the Phi Kappa, basketball
quintet; the Craig Street ﬁve received
its ﬁrst basketball defeat Tuesday
from Phi Delta Theta.

The Phi Delts went into the battle
with ﬁve victories and two defeats,
and comparative scores between
them and the Phi Kaps gave little
hopes of the Phi Delts’ achieving
victory.

Phi Kappa still holds ﬁrst place in
the basketball standing by the slight
marin of nine victories and one de-
feat to the Phi Gains’ eight wins
and one black mark. The Phi Delts
and Kappa Sigs are still in the run-
iiings with six triumphs and two loss-
es each.

Phi Epsilon Pi sprung another up-
set when it defeated a highly fa-
vored Delta Tau Delta ping pong
team, 10-2, on Tuesday.

The Delts continue in ﬁrst place in
ping pong with 79 wins and 17 de-
feats followed by the Phi Eps who.
have 74 and 22.

Phi Delta Theta and Phi Gamma
Delta are having a nip and tuck race
for the volley ball championship
with the Phi Delts on top at the pres-
ent by the slender margin of 15 vic-
tories and a percentage of 1.000 to
the Phi Gams 14 wins and one loss.

Defending champions, Theta Chi,
are tops in bowling at the present
with 17 wins in 18 battles. Sigma
Chi rates second by virtue of 15 tri-
urnps in 18 engagements followed by
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Delta The-
ta, each with 14 victories and four
defeats- .

leave for a short Ohio jaunt which
starts with tomorrow’s Ohio State
meet at Columbus and ends Monday

night in the Kenyon College pool at
Gambier.

The Slippery Rock meet had Pitt
capture eight out of nine events and
the only surprises were turned in
by Panthers who upset favored team-
mates.

Bob Schrader’s win over Nowotny
in the 50-yard freestyle and Al Slo-
bodian’s win over teammate A1 Bea-
con in the 150-yard backstroke were
the upsets. Captain Manke of Slip-
pery Rock won his team’s only ﬁrst
in 200-yard breaststroke.

Against Temple the Corrmen im-

nine events. Beacon and Lederstein
were double winners. Nowotny,
Bill Brown, Hyman Lederstein and
the relay teams came through with
the other wins.

Tomorrow night’s meet with Ohio
State’s team will place the Pitt
swimmers in the same pool with the
leading threat for the National swim-

State returns to the waters with es-
sentially the same squad.

Monday’s meet with Kenyon will
be another tough evening for the

day, the Panther icers ran a deﬁnite
third, as far as holding the interest
of the crowd was concerned, to the
Duquesne Dukes and a ﬁre in the
press box.

The Dukes rolled up the largest

score of the league season as they
swamped the husky but helpless
Baldwin VVallace sextet, 11-0. Be-

tween the ﬁrst and second periods of
the Pitt-Tech game, a hot wire start-
ed a mild blaze in the press box, pro-
viding excitement that had been no-
ticeably absent from the ﬁrst session
of the Panther-Skibo battle.

Although Coach Mcsorley kept
five men down the ice during most of
the game, the league leaders did lit-
tle more than give Tech goalie Fieler
a chance to make a few neat saves.
For a team that was supposedly
wrecked by ineligibility, the Tartans
kept Pitt pretty well in check.

The Blue and Gold looked more
like a hockey team in the third pe-
riod, passing and checking more ef-
ﬁciently and scoring twice. With the
power drive on, Dick Friday ﬂipped
the puck into the right hand corner
of the net at 6:31, then passed to
Brittain at 7:19 for the ﬁnal goal.

Scientist Reports on Fauna Life
Found on Stormy ‘Isle of Fire’

Dr. Murphy Relates
Whaling Experiences
In Subarctic Region

By Robert Hamilton
Curator of oceanic birds at the

American Museum of Natural Histo- ‘

ry in. New York, Dr. Robert Cush-
man Murphy gave an illu:~;trated lec-
ture on his first expedition before the
Pittsburgh Academy of Science and
Art last Thursday night.

Dr. Murphy, who was listed in the 5

sixth edition of “American Men of

Science," as one of the 250 outstand- .
ingscientists in the last ﬁve years,§
was the ﬁrst man to photograph the;
fauna of the desolate island of South 3

Dr. Murphy made his trip on a
iwhale ship, the only means of reach-
ing the island, and remained for four
inonths during the whaling season.
He brought back the first motion pic-
tures of the elephant seal, and many
interesting photographs of the whal-
ing industry, which had been scien-
tiﬁcally studied by the Director of
the American Museum, Dr. Roy Chap-
man’ Andrews.

the island are about 800 small horses,

there by a German Antarctic explor-
er who had hoped to use them in the

Dentistry Students Release lssue
Featuring Health lnsurance Plan

Featuring an editorial discussion‘?

of the American Dental association’s
attitude on health insurance, the
January issue of Dental Rays, oﬂicial
quarterly publication of the School
of Dentistry, was recently released.
I Concerning the A. D. A. and its
attitude, the magazine points out that
both the American Medical associa-
tion and the A. D. A. were faced
with the comparable situations of
large majorities opposed to any form
of health insurance and with “small
but vigorous minorities militantly at-
tacking ‘ofllcial blindness and reac-
tion.”’
AMA Intolerant

The editorial shows that while the
A. M. A. has refused to tolerate a
minority approving health insur-
ance, and has thus driven respected
representatives into rebel groups,
the A. D. A. “has been suﬂlciently
liberal to tolerate, (not too cheerful-
ly, however) minority opinion, and
to provide such opinion with an op-
portunity for expression at its oili-
C131 meeting.”

Pointing out such a difference of,

action, the e~:litorial draws the con-
clusion that “while medicine ﬁnds

its reactionary position exposed toi

the critical glare of public opinion,
the dental profession has been re-
garded . as a liberal and pro-
gressive profession.”

An article,

dental schools has been and is a
“definite reﬂectiou of national de-
pression, recovery, and recession."
The magazine contains other ar-
ticles by Dr. Adolph L. Bielski, who

discusses “Root Resection”; and by‘

Dr. A. C. Young, who writes on
“The Technique of Soldering.”

The constitution of the Univer-
sity's Dental Alumni Association is
recorded in full in this issue.

Upperclass Coeds May

A class in outdoor recreation,
which will begin Thursday, February
16, is now open to upperclass women
as well as freshmen women, accord-
ing to Dr. Elizabeth Rearick, asso-
ciate professor of physical education.

The class which will meet every
Thursday afternoon over a six-week
period, is a 12 hour course which in-
cludes six hours of horseback riding.
‘ Fee for the course is $5.00 without

Pittsburgh Trade
Maintains Stability

Showing a high degree of stability
since the middle of November, the
index of business in the Pittsburgh
district last week advanced 1.2 points
to 83.7 per cent of the 1923-25 aver-
age,. the University Bureau of Busi-
ness Research revealed today.

This rise in business activity, re-
sulting partly from increased indus-
trial production, represents a slight
advance over a slump during the lat-
ter part of the month.

Moderately large gains were re-
ported in steel mill activity, in elec-
tric power production and in bitum-
lI'lOUS coal production.

In its monthly summary of eco-
nomic condition in the district, the
“Pittsburgh Business Review,” the
bureau reports that the index for
.general business average 86.9 per
cent of the 1923-25 average in De-

“Dental Educational .
Statistics" by F. J. Widney, ’39, points 
out that enrollment in the nation’s ;

cember, a new high level in the re-
gcovery period.

, Employment statistics reveal that
{more people were employed in the
‘district and their payrolls were
 larger in December than in any other
 month of 1938, and for the ﬁrst time,
!payrolls in a current month were
above those in the corresponding
month a year earlier.

A coveted award among all publishers and printers,
selection of two books is high praise for Lawrence E.
Irwin, manager; printers, artists, and binders. Both
books are distinctly regional, in that they were writ-
ten, illustrated, and printed in Western Pennsylvania
by Western Pennsylvanians. Copies of the books have
been sent public, college, and high school libraries by
the Buhl Foundation, which has aided in the project

Says Aviatrix on

By Alice Benovitz

“It’s vastly more important that
the government educate the Amer-
ican public to be air-minded than it
is to train more pilots. There are
hundreds of unemployed pilots at
the present time.” Such is the opin-
ion of Ruth Nichols, the famous av-

iatrix, who visited the University
last Tuesday.

Women Handicapped

help publicize the ﬁlm, “Tailspin.”
According to her, women have
shown themselves fully as compe-
tent as men in this ﬁeld. To date,

however, they have been handi-
capped by insufficient ﬁnancial aid.

Possessing an impressive list of
honors and awards such as being the
earliest licensed woman ﬂyer pilot-
ing in the United States today, and
being the only woman to have set
three world’s records, Miss Nichols is
of course primarily occupied with
aviation.

Active Educator

However she is very active in the
ﬁeld of adult education. She be-
lieves that the American public ac-
cepts the privileges of democracy
without undertaking the obligations.
Miss Nichols said, “I hope to see a
new patriotism develop. By patriot-
ism, I mean a real interest in pre-
serving the liberties we are fortunate
enough to have today.”

Miss Nichols has adso done excel-

tional relations. A few years’ ago,
and Admiral Byrd in presenting in-
ternational problems to the public
and in organizing voters to express
paciﬁst sentiment through their con-
gressmen.

Never Dull
While walking through the Ca-
thedral, Miss Nichols said, “I hope

that college students have a calmer,
.more intelligent attitude toward war

,than the average citizen. I wonder.

"if they would rush blindly into war.”

Miss Nichols’ plans are rather
vague at the moment, but she ex-
lpects to undertake a solo long dis-
tance ﬂight in the future. When
asked if ﬂying ever became routine
or dull, she answered, “we ﬂyers
have a saying that life and ﬂying
may be up or down—but never dull.”

Civic Club to Hear Talk

Dr. Harvey E. Gayman, assistant
‘executive secretary and director of
research of the Pennsylvania State
Educational association, will discuss
the association’s program of school

morrow at 12:15 o’clock in the Wil-
‘diam Penn Hotel.
