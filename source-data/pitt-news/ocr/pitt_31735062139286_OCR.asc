Work on Annual Play Is Progressing
Rapidly-—Birdsall Will Coach
Players. ‘

 

 

The Cap and Gown Club has been
making great strides toward the per-
fection of its annual performance.
Tyler of the Dental school, who has
taken charge of the dancing, has
rounded his charges into- form with
increditable swiftness. The keen in-
terest shown by every member as well
as the regular attendance which has
characterized every rehearsal bids fair
to the greatest and most successful
year of the club.

Mr. Arthur Birdsall will direct tile
dramatic end of the play. He has
charge of the anniversary play to be
given by the University in February,
as well as many. other large amateur
performances to be given in this vi-
cinity. The club is to be congratu-
lated on obtaining such an experienced
man to coach them.

Parts for the play have been as-
signed, and every man is working hard
that the production may be a credit
to the University as a whole. Almost
every department is represented. Give
the club your most loyal support, both
by word, and by attendance at its per-
formances.»

DENTS SUFFER ACCIDENT.

During the extreme cold weather of
the past few days many accidents (se-
vere and otherwise) have occurred
which the public press has made well
known, but there was one which did
happen, but received no comment, and
which proved ‘quite disastrous to the
Dental building on Brereton avenue.
Some time during the early hours of
the morning .a water pipe, which had
frozen, bursted and ﬂooded about half

of the building, but fortunately this

happened in the part not used for
dental purposes, so did not interfere
with the regular lectures scheduled for
that day.’ The students and faculty
as well are anxiously looking forward
to the completion of the new dental
building now undergoing construction.

 

PROM COMMITTEE WORKING.

The Junior Prom of the class of
1913 promises to be one of the best

in the history of the University if"

preparations count for anything. The
committee appointed by the president

is one composed of energetic men.

and they are rapidly completing prep-
arations for the affair. Three meetings
have already been held and a vigorous
effort {is being made to secure the best
possible accommodations. The pro-
gram and minor details are being rap-
idly prepared.‘

Dean Bishop will meet all the

. freshmen next Monday at'l:30. This

will take the place of the engineering
lecture.

THE COSMO‘P0'Ll{I‘AN CLUB.

During the last week deﬁnite steps
:have been taken toward the formation
;of a strong Cosmopolitan Club. This
7is a much-needed organization. The
time has come when with so many
different nationalities represented in
the student body of the University,
we“ must make agreater effort to
bring these men into closer contact
‘with each other and the rest of the
students. We must m-ake welcome the
,strangers- who will come to our school
In no better way

’than through the servcces of an alert,
‘strong -Cosmopolitan Club. It will be
able to perform a service in the Uni-
iversity possibly greater than any
other organization.

The organizaﬁon of this club has
:been .a most difficult task. It required
Egreat perseverance. For the men who
;devoted their energies to this work
Enos words of praise can be wasted.
They are shorwing, a ﬁne example of
the Pit-t spirit which makes every
jman welcome to Pitt. Though the
:organizers of the club‘ may not think
so at present, through‘ their ‘labors

-than they could possibly receive from

»-twice the time spent in their studies.
, They are bu-ildirig for the future ‘«a.

club which will do a great work. The
men who become members of this
organization will have placed upon
them. an important duty-—a heavy re-
sponsibility. If the administration of
the Cosmopolitan Club i-s- as success-
ful as its organization, this responsi-
bility will be ably met. The best
wishes of the entire student body are
with the Cosmopolitans.

 

CLASS TEAMS.

‘Owing to comp-Iaints preferred by
certain members of the Freshman-
class thatlthe 1-915 basketball team
has been chosen without any call be-
i-rug made for candidates, the question.
of proper supervision over class ath-
letic teams by the athletic autho.ritie.=
has beenbrought to our attention.
Whether the complaints in this par-
ticular case be based upon facts or
not, the athletic committee should
more carefully direct the class ath-,
letics in the ’University. Some atten-
tion should be paid to, this case im-
mediately. If the complaints _are un-

cleared immediately. If there bt
ground for dissatisfaction, the reasons
for this feeling should be removed.
The importance for the most care-
iful direction ofclass athletics can not
be over-emphasized. The new men"
upon‘ whom the responsibility for the
iimanagement.-of the Freshman team is
iplaced’ can not be expects-d with their

In view of the fact that I can not

[ ‘PITT ‘PAY TS

By Prowler.

The main corridor in Thaw Hall
was not a particularly warm spotlast
week, and in -attempting to ﬁnd a
heated room I discovered myself in a
place which had some claims to a
class room and an office, but resem-
bled nei-ther. A very genial chap
with rather light hair, inclined to
po-mp, tip—t-o_ed up to me and whis-
pered in my ear: “This is the Pitt
Weekly office. What’s your busi-
ness?” , .

Did you ever have anyone aim that
imp-ertinent query at you? Well, just
between you and me, -it places one in
an exceedingly embarrassing position.

Of course my chief aim was to seek
warmth, which I readily communi-

cated to the boy in the oﬂice (not the
It ‘

ofﬁce boy, as I found out later).
was only a few minutes (with the as-
sistance of an obliging radiator) until
the young man and I were -in an ear-
nest conversation concerning the Chi-
nese revolution and woman’s suffrasge
-—kindred topics!

A lull in- the discussion permitted-
%th-e= aspiring member of the “Fourth

Estate” to inform me that he was the _

“Ixty It Editor” on the University
gpu-bl-ication. Overj-oyed to meet such‘
an honorable personage I, in a mo-
ment of extreme p-‘resumptuousness

?asked how th-e- office’ was awarded to.‘
ihim. He replied’ that‘ it was an elec—;

‘itive position open to any studen-t in
the Uni-versiity-ab1e to amass a« ma?-
jority of votes.  V‘  V 1

The answer was food for an ani-‘
mated talk during trh»e,r‘emain-der of
my stay in the Pitt Weekly office, and
I have not forgotten the- matter all
this week.

Did you ever attempt to manage a.
newspaper? It is at‘ once the most
disagreeableand agreeable (paradox-
ical, as it seems) task in the universe.
But, ‘quite apart from the joys and
sorrows of the professi-on, whether it
be the editorship of a metropolitan
daily or that «of the cross roads week-
ly, there is one prime requirement,
and that is, Ability. [Capable news-
paper men are, to -paraphrase an old.
saying, born, not made.

And I do not know of any observa-
tion so pertinent in the in-terest of
"the student body than the foregoing
paragraph when "selections f-or posi-
tions on this paper are made um“
term. You say “Yes, Mr. Prowler,
very good and perhaps very true, but
t-here is still a lot of time to think
about such affairs.”

But, I say no. Now is the time to
study the names of the Juniors
“Sophomores and Freshmen on‘ the
‘staff. Now is the time to- appreciate
the work of the men on the board.
Now is the time to distribute a few
hearty slaps of encouragement.

Now is the time to -inau.g,ura‘te the
compe-titive system for next term.

The men, who have’ shown their
ability this term, are entitled to the
high places when the next choice is
made, and not t'he “vote gette-rs.”

You will remember, I told you last
week that I am not connected with

,this newspaper, and I want you to

bear in mind when you meditate over
the remarks I -have Just made. It is
immaterial to me whether you decide
upon Smith. or, Brown, for I have no
concern in the matter (nor friends to
elect), but get the right man by legi-
timate competition. '

I strolled ‘into the “Clearing

sure whether they were going to build
a Y. M. C. A., a church, a. gym., a
theater or a dan.ce hall. Could you
ﬁgure i-t out? Those “captains” of

M011. ‘Box
Mr. Editor: W S A _
I thought I would write you con-

cerning a matter which is of vital im— .

portance to the school. In. a school
of 1,500 students it is to my mind ab-
solutely necessary that school activi-
ties should be conducted on a fair
basis. The football, track, basketball
baseball‘ and’ all the varsity teams’ are
chosen by competition and competition
alone. Now if these teams are han-
dled in such a manner why shouldn’t
the class teams be so managed?

The freshman basketball team this
year has been handled in a most un-
satisfactory manner. The team has
been pi-cked without any practice; and
from among fellows whose.-past ex-
perience is unknown. Many of us
did not get the chance that others did
and I would like the matter looked
into.'I do not blame the manager en-
tirely but the committee or whatever it
is that has charge of athletics, because
they do not look into the control of
the teams and take charge of it as
they do other teams. Then we would
have a place to practice like ot-her
freshman teams and a team that would

be the best the class could develop.

Trusting t'hat.your inﬂuence mav be
used in this matter, I remain sincerely
yours, A Freshman.

If the charges made by this fresh-
man be true, the Athletic Committee
should investigate the s-ituation imme-
diately. Management ofclass teams-

by cliques should be utterly discoun-

ltenanced by all Pitt men.———Ed.

iv Atthe monthly meeting of the Ath-

. letic Committee last week, the ques-

tion of ‘baseball was br-ought up and

I while no deﬁnite action was taken rel-

ative to this sport it is more than
probable that ‘Pitt will not have a

- team. Director Miller has been mak-

ing a careful study of the situation

i _ for some -time and informed the com-

mittee that he.had been unable to lo-
cate sufﬁcient seasoned material in
the different schools of the University
to form a high caliber team and that
on this account it was better to de-

L velop material througlriiiteerclass and
‘department games than to get a poor
_start with a Varsity team. This logic

' is .unquestionab‘ly‘ Sound

and while
many Pitt men will be disgruntled by

I the lack of a Varsity team on the dia-

mond, they will agree that it is right

I if they stop to consider the question.

The worn and threadbare discussion

‘ of__summer baseball was also aired at

the meeting with the resu_lt that Di-
rector Miller was asked to make a
careful study of the matter and to
bring in a report in the near future.

PITT TRACK TEAM WILL
  rrrrr BIG INDOOR MEETS

The track team of the University
will have representatives in the big
annual meets of the Pittsburgh Ath-
letic Association and the Pittsburgh
branch of the Y. M. C. A. t-o be held
at Duquesne Garden late this winter.
The former meet will be held on Feb-
ruary 9th and the latter on March
17th. J

The most attractive events of these
meets will._be the relays but there will
also be handicap events in all dis-
tances and in the 12-pound s'hot put
and high jump. The limit handicap
in the 60-yard dash is about 7 feet,
but in the distance runs many yards
are given men who have never made
a good showing, so all have a-nearly
equal chance._ Several inches are al-
lowed in the high jump and six or
seven feet are often allowed in the
shot put.

 

Any Pitt man who has ever done
any track or ﬁeld work is urged to
confer with the track manager or Di-
rector Miller so that he may be en-
tered in these meets.

as we hope to do in baseball and
later we can pick a varsity team to

It is my opinion that soccer football
is on the boom. Many of the less
hardy students who take little inter-
est in the rugby game and who, in
fact, would be endangering their lives
by doing so owing to their poor phy-
ical development would secure much
enjoyment in soccer football I am
sure. I ﬁnd that many of the large
colleges are taking up the game and
while the consensus of opinion seems
to be that it will never supplant rug-
by, there is room enough for both.
Soccer can be played all year ’round

Mei1agerMaeQ1ioirn Adds

A At the last meeting «of the Athletic
Committee, Manager MacQuown
asked that games with the Westing-
house Club and with P. A. A. be ap-
proved, and after a lengthy discus-
sion of the matter the committee put
its O._ K. on two games with the lat-
ter club and one game with the for-
mer. The Committee has always
frowned on games with athletic clubs
as there is always a question as to the
athletic standing of “such players, but
Direc-tor Miller and others certiﬁed
as to the amateur standing of all
players on the Westinghouse and P.
A. A. ‘teams the matter took on a dif-
ferent aspect.

The Westinghouse team is coin-
posed of ex-college/players who are
-all registered in the A. A. U. and the
same is the case of P. A. A. repre-
sentatives on the basketball ﬂoor.
Both teams are good ones and a live-
ly ﬁght is anticipated as Westing-
house defeated Waynesburg with
ease and snowed Westminster College
completely under. P. A. A. also beat
Waynesburg and Carnegie Tech.
Westinghouse will be played on their
floor, Saturday, February 10, and P.
A. A. will be played on their floor
January 29 and on .our floor March 13.

Freshmen Trim Latrobe High

The 1915 basketball team bids fair
to make as enviable a record as the
Freshman team of the year previous

 

as they defeated Latrobe High
School 26-17 in their ﬁrst game. La-
trobe has a good team and the

“wearers of the green” had a hard
tussle in downing them, but ﬁnally
succeeded in getting the decision.
Graham and Ochsenhirt found the
basket with ease and, combined with
good guarding by Kepp and Kerne-
'han, enabled the Pitt tossers to cop.
Gallagher did well for Latrobe.

UNION COLLEGE

Large Crowd at Alliance En-
thuses Over Exciting Game;
Pitt Players Overcome Lead
and Nose Out Victory 16-I4;
Coach Flint Pleased

 

V\/hen Pitt followers learned that
thei_r team would face the same lineup
that Mt. Union had last year they
were dubious over the outcome as the
Alliance team is one of the best in
Ohio. Last season the Gold and Blue
lost by a good sized score and with
only two of the 1911 players‘ back it
looked. like an easy thing for Mt.
Union to repeat-

A large crowdiattended the game
and at times was wild with excite-
ment, as the contest was nip and tuck
with both teams ﬁghting every min-
The
Mt. Union team displayed splendid
guarding in the ﬁrst half and the Pitt
forwards were unable to score a sin-
gle ﬁeld goal, the only points annexed
being three foul goals by Frishman.
In the meantime -the opposition had
made a total of seven points, which
seemed a fair lead with such closely
matched teams. A

The start of the second half found
Pitt with a slightly changed lineup,
as Frishman was shifted to forward,
with Broido holding down his guard.
Graham replaced Bane at
while Capt. Campbell and Wells and
McDowell remained in their former
positions. This move on the part of
Coach Flint proved a good one, as
the Mt. Union combination was solved
and Pitt won handily. Graduate
Manager Hurst was very fortunate in
securing this former star as coach of
the basketball team, as there are few
men in this section of the country
with Dr. Flint’s knowledge of the
floor game. He is familiar with the
eastern method of basketball which
seems to be better than that formerly
taught at Pitt and has worked out
combinations under the new intercol-
legiate rules that will make the Gold
and Blue a dangerous team’ to all op-
ponents. Dr. Flint is very much
pleased with the spirit exhibited by
the players and believes that the sea-
son will prove a successful one.

The entire Pitt team played good
basketball, but the w-ork of Capt.
Campbell, McDowell and Frishman
was especially good. For M-t. Union

think such an affair is signiﬁcant in
regard to the future?” From every
person comes an expression—his View

on the new problem of the University

Members of student Senate have
grave faces these days, and as they
gather in little groups and with
hushed voices talk the matter over,
one cannot help but see the serious-
ness with which they are trying’ tc
solve the question. -

Also, the young women have picked
up a wonderful store of political
knowledge with which they are pre-
pared to back up their “Petition for
Rights.” They talk ﬂuently on~tax—
ation without representation; they un-
derstand Burke from start to ﬁnish;
they are able. to give verbatim page
after page from such authorities as
Bryce, Baird, Thorpe and many
others.

Miss M. A. Moldenham, who is on
the committee appointed to draw up
to be known as the Girls’ Executive
tive committee, when interviewed on

the question, gave out the following,
statement: |

“Owing to the numerous inquiries:
concerning the girls’ governing board

to be known as the Girls’ Executive
Committee, we W1Sl1 to give out a few

explanations as to the use and purpnsr

of this body.

“In the first place", it is not de-

signed to interfere in any way with
the duties and rights of the Senate or
Board of Control of the University.
It is merely designed to afford an or-
ganization for the girl students, to
take charge of all the activities and
the various functions of the girls, and
to govern them in general.

“As the number‘-of women students
in the University increases, some or-
ganization becomes essential; and
since the girls are not represented on
the Senate or in any of the school
activities, they are brought face to
face with the old story of “Taxation
Without Representation.’

“This organization, when looked at
in the proper light, is seen to be abso-
lutely necessary on the part of the
girls in binding them into a strong,
active body which will concern itself
primarily, not with festivities, as some
think, but with the betterment and
proper coalition in every way of the
girls as a whole.’’

J. VV. Hallock, president of the
Board of Control, gave out this state-
ment: “I cannot say deﬁnitely, but I
am of the opinion that the Board of
Control favors the granting of the

:wishes of the girls, at least to a cer-

tain degree.”

J. J. O’Connor, ’l0,”who is a very
prominent member of the General
Alumni Council, expressed himself as
being very decidedly against making
any change from the system now in
operation.
