Budget Crisis
Won't Hurt
Student Aid

$Representatives Detail
Appropriations Stands

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer

“I will not be a prostitute to any
government.”—Joseph V. Zord,
Republican representative from
Allegheny County.

“I will not budge one inch from
my position. You may hate me and
my position, but at least you have it
straight.”—-—Michael P. Schaefer,
Democratic senator from Allegheny
County.

“If it came down to the bottom

«ﬁne and they needed one more vote,
’ my vote would be there. ’ ’—Charles

T. Logue, Democratic representa-
tive from Allegheny County.

Sept. 29, the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved Pitt’ state appropriation
of nearly $62 million as part of an
overall non-preferred appropriaton
package of $300 million. Oct. 18, the
State Senate followed suit.

“You (the students) are overract-
ing, and I think your fears are
unfound. You are overly concerned.
“I’ll make a personal prediction:
This problem will be gone by the
third week in November. That is my
personal prediction.”

Sen. Schaefer, a young Democrat
who represents 20 Allegheny
County communities, brieﬂy stated
his position, then placed responsi-
bility for the universities’ troubles
at the doorstep of the men who rim
them.

“I voted against every one of the
appropriations bills. I am firmly
committed to no tax increase this
year,” Schaefer said, referring to
the often-discussed solution to the
appropriation funding problem.

“I am not sympathetic to colleges
for having . to borrow and pay
interest, Schaefer continued. “You

Financial aid for Pitt students will
not be adversely aﬁected by the
budget crunch in Harrisburg,
according to University Financial
Aid Director Frank Dutkovich.

“Funds in the forms of work-
study monies, grants and loans at
all levels, Federal, state and
university, will still be made
available for the winter term,”
Dutkovich said. “We are not
holding back any funding.

“Actually, out award process
begins well in advance of the school
year,” Dutkovich said. For
freshmen it began last January, and
by September all ﬁnancial aid for
both the fall and winter terms had
been committed. Funds from the
state have already been appro-
priated, and it is the University's
responsibility to provide them,”
Dutkovich said. “Naturally, money

tors, attempting to convince them of
the need for a swift and fair

of the legislators the student

Sen. Schaefer and Rep. Logue-
voted against Pitt’s appropriation.
“I’ll give it to you straight,” Zord
told the students. “When they

The chairman of the Slavic
department has denied charges of
discrimination in the hiring and
ﬁring of teachers.

Dr. Jane Harris labelled the
charges ﬁled by Fr. Ivan Dornic as
“shocking” and “very disturb-
ing.”

“There is no discrimination in
this department,” Harris said,
“nor is there discrimination at this
University.”

Dornic was a part-time instructor
in the department before he
resigned in protest over the alleged
discriminations.

Dornic- based his charges on an
external evaluation known as the
“Gibian-Mathewson report’ ’ which
recommended the dismissal of the
then (1973) chairm_a_n of the
Slavic department, Nikolai Polto-
ratzky, and assistant professor
Alexey Kiselev. Poltoratzky, who

teaches in the department; Kiselev
is no longer employed at Pitt.
Dornic claims the report was
hastily put together (the evaluators
spent one day in Pittsburgh) and
unfair.

Harris spoke in defense of the
report.

“F.-very department has to do a
self-evaluation in terms of its
program, its faculty, its offerings
and what it can do to change
things,” Harris said. “Then, an
outside evaluation is called in by
the dean.

Actually, there is a great deal of
data that can be used by these
people, so one or two days is
probably sufficient,” Harris con-
tinued.” You probably can get a
good idea of what the people
(teachers) here are like, what their
attitudes are like, what their

teaching methods are like and what more capable candidates

they expect of their students.”
Dornic also claimed Harris, a

Slavic origin.

Fr. Ivan Dornic initiated controversy in the Slavic Department last month when
he resigned his position as part-time instructor after alleging it practiced
ethnic bias in its hiring practices.

State Lawmakers Explain
Appropriations Stances

((‘ontinuedfrom Page 1)

Schaefer also offered a way the
universities to save more than $10
million in needed funds annually.

“The universities would save $10
million per year if professors would
put in one extra hour a week in class
and teach one extra student per
week.”

When asked about his changing
his current thinking Schaefer said,
“You have to look them in the eye.
You think this is easy? It’s not. I
don’t particularly enjoy this.”

Rep. Logue, whose constitutents
live in St. Clair, Mt. Oliver and part
of Oakland, cited Pitt’s failure to
serve the community better as his
reason for voting against the
appropriation.

“The people in the neighbor-
hoods are concerned about Pitt’s
expansion,” Logue said. “They
squeeze people out with its
expansion. For all the people you
bring in, it creates problems with
the people in the area.

Student Aid

  .3,Not Affected

By Crisis

(Continued from Page 1)

For students seeking ﬁnancial aid
for the winter term only, Dutkovich
said. “We have reopened
applications for these students, but
as always, the funds for winter term
aid are very limited.”

“In the fall, students are
awarded aid for both the fall and

\_S\A'inter terms." Dutkovich explain-
” ed.

“Winter term funds for new

students starting in January or for
those who did not apply for aid by
the fall deadline consist of whatever
money is left over from students
declining aid from the fall awards.

 

“Pitt is the largest real estate
company in the City of Pittsburgh,"
Logue continued. “They get the
maximum dollar out of students."

Logue also Verbalized what every
legislator is thinking about but very
few actually are admitting: the fear
of having the crisis drag closer and
closer to May and primary
re-election time.

“If it came down to the bottom
line and they needed one more vote,
my vote would be there. There is a
lot of pressure on usto end this
thing. We have to run for
re-election next year and next year
is not that far away.

“I would not like to see Pitt go
down the drain.” '

Slavic Head Maintains

He said a number of people were
considered for the position of
chairman both Slav and non-Slav,
and that Harris was the best
qualiﬁed.

“Dr. Harris seemed to be the
best person for the job.“ Jaszczun
said.

Jaszczun said since Harris’
appointment, new courses have
been introduced in the department,
and there are more undergraduate
students.

“She has done an excellent
job." he said. “She has put the
department back on track."

“We’ve had an increase in
enrollment of about 30 to 60
percent in our classes," Harris
said “We have been doing very
well, compared to other language

departments. We are a small
department, but this enables us to
work with the students on an
individual basis, which a lot of
other departments cannot do.”
Harris expressed regret Dornic
did not meet with her before he
announced his resignation.

“_He didn't come to see me,”
she said. “It (Dornic’s resignation)
hurt the students more than it hurt
the department.”

Dornic has indicated the Depart-
ment of Labor is planning an
investigation'of the case, but
Harris does not believe an
investigation will turn up anything.

“He’s already had one case
thrown out of court,” Harris said.
“He is well-known for bringing
everything to court that he can.

It Begins At Home

‘Charity may begin at home, but some area legislators certainly
didn’t think of Western Pennsylvania this month when called to
vote upon non-preferred appropriations in the state budget.

represent Allegheny County in Harrisburg and were among a small
minority of state legislators who said “nay” when asked to
consider a slot in the Pennsylvania budget for Pitt.

money until revenues to cover it have been raised.

As if Pitt students didn’t know this.
He said he refused to vote for a budget that held the institutions

of higher learning as hostages.

His operation was a success, but will the patient live?
Logue’s position is perhaps the most surprising since part of his

constituency resides in the Oakland area.

He doesn't think Pitt

does enough for the community, especially for area elderly voters.
Logue also claims that Pittexpansion squeezes people out.
Logue feels a pressure bigger than the demand for adequate

higher education.

“There’s a lot of pressure on us to end this

thing. We have to run for re-election next year, and next year is not

Pitt Anti-Cheating Integrity Compromised

I ﬁnd it impossible to condemn
the students at Pitt who engage in
cheating when the University has
compromised its integrity and
sanctioned dishonesty among its
enrollment.

Two years ago, a medical student
was accused and convicted of
cheating before the medical school
student honor committee. She had
been observed entering a labora-
tory during a test, which was a
clear and known violation of their
honor system.

After a fair hearing, the
committee voted to suspend‘ her
from the school for a period of one
year. This punishment was
prescribed by the honor rules.

The student employed an attor-
ney who ﬁled charges individually
against the students on the
committee, several administrators,
including the dean of the medical

Caliguiri’s
Virtues
Ranked

It is highly ironic that interim
mayo'r Caliguiri should identify
credibility as the major problem in
politics today. Trustworthiness
does not rank high on a list of his
virtues. As for me, I would sooner
vote to elect Spiro Agnew mayor of
Pittsburgh than this man.

school and Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, and against the University.

She claimed the procedures that
were employed violated her due
process rights under the Constitu-
tion. Her factual allegations in the
complaint were denied by members
of the committee, who requested
the University defend the suit.

The lawyers for the University
denied their request. Although
they did not specify their reasons
for refusal, possible explanations
include cost to the school or the
possibility of administrators being
held financially liable. The
committee felt that she had been
given a fair and full opportunity
with adequate prior notice to
explain her actions. If this is true
they would not have committed the
alleged violation.

The University “settled” the suit
by .permitting the student to
re-enroll in exchange for her
dropping of all charges. This
actions clearly deminstrates the
lack of concern that the University
officials have for maintaining
homer and integrity in their
classrooms.

By refusing even to defend the
suit they virtually destroyed any
possibility of honesty in the school,
as any student accused of a
violation can simply follow prece-
dent by suing the University and
having all charges dropped in a
closed-door settlement.

If the Chancellor and administra-
tors consider cheating to be a

wrong, then they should openly’

legitimize it so that students who
agree can apply to this University.

As an alumnus newspaper
writer, you have my heartfelt
sympathy: g I can recall moments
when my editor would approach-
me, in late afternoon, and .say
“Marc, cover that zoning board
meeting at town hall tonight.”
And with little experience or
understanding of the complexity of
zoning I would be obliged to
cover—inadequately cover—my
assignment. I can imagine your
dismay when you were handed the
assignment for the “Forum”
article (The Pitt News, Oct. 26).

Well, interesting reading, but for

Other Rituals
Stranger» Than
Witchcraft

I am pleased to see that reporter
Ken Gromley approached the
subject of modern witches with 
open mind (Oct. 26, “Salem
Witches Are Still Hanging In
There.”) It is unfortunate,
however, that the article labors
under the popular misconceptions
about witches, for instance, what
do witches “look like?” And what
is a “strange ritual,”. anyway?
Incidentally, a witch is a witch,
male or female; there are no
“warlocks” in witchcraft.

What we know as “witchcra ” is
simply a religion, known to its
followers as Wicca (wisdom), which
pre-dates Christianity. and most
other present religions. It is a
religion that emphasizes being in
touch with one’s inner self and w‘ ,.-

nature. Most images of Wicca th¥\.4 

have survived to the present are
the distortions and lies that were
concocted centuries ago, in periods
of cultural warfare, to discredit and
destroy people's indigenous relig-
ions and political systems and
thereby make it easier to enforce
both a new religion (often
Christianity) and a new rule,
despotic patriarchy.

This information is not widely
known, since we are presently
living in a patriarchal system,
Nevertheless, more and mi?
people throughout this country and
the world are joining together to
revive the practice of Wicca. One
need not travel to Salem to ﬁnd
witches.

As for strange rituals, what could
possibly surpass the Lenten sta-
tions of the cross or football
games? And when it comes to dark
alleys, I would much rather run into
a witch than most average
American males.

The only people possessed by
anything in 1692 were the
witchhunters-—possessed by irr.- ,
tional fear and hatred, not unlike; C

The Allegheny County Air

the referendum. So have the

An aide to United Steel Workers
of America President Lloyd Mc-

“extremely misleading... (it) in-
correctly presumes that the federal

“economic blackmail."

motivation for proposing the
referendum, the critics are correct:
it's a bad idea. It's a bad idea
because it replaces the real issue
with a false choice. Rather than
suggesting a way in which we
might have a healthy environment
and a healthy economy at the same
time, the referendum tells us to
take our pick.

In fact, the phrasing of the
question can only retard efforts to
come up with a more holistic

perspective on quality of life. The
commissioners‘ referendum seems
to assume that clean air and jobs do
not and cannot go together, as if we
can’t have our cake and eat it too.

We can ill afford to perpetuate
that kind of myth. In this country
we have for two hundred years
defined "the good life” in terms of
material wealth. and it is only
recently that we have begun to
appreciate the cost of that narrow

deﬁnition in terms of environ-
mental, social, aesthetic, and
psychic welfare. Unless we

acknowledge that all areas of life
are equally important to the
realization of human potential. we
will be voting on inane either/or
referendums til doomsday.

The phrasing of the question is
deceptive in still another way, as
was pointed out by the USWA
official quoted above. Relaxation
of environmental standards would
in no way guarantee any jobs
saving in the Pittsburgh area.

The problem with mills in the
northeast is not so much pollution
control as it is age. Simply put,
older mills can cost as much as
30-40% more to run than newer
ones.

foreign competition—not environ-

jor motivating factors in the
decision to close the older,
relatively inefficient mills. By

transferring operations to the more
mechanized midwestern facilities.

Youngstown Steel found it could
save on labor costs and more easily
turn a proﬁt. Environmental
pressures, according to one com-
pany executive, were merely “icing
on the cake."

So the answer to unemployment
in Allegheny County’s steel in-
dustry will not be found in any
across-the-board compromise of
environmental standards. The
ancient mills along the county’s
three rivers will continue their
plunge toward obsoleteness no
matter how much smoke they are
permitted to belch.

Modernization may not be the
answer either. The trend in steel
industry capital investment has
always been toward increased
mechanization, and that hardly
bodes well for the unemployment
rate or the environment.

Finding our way to full employ-
ment in an environment that is
already over-taxed by past misuse
will be no easy task. Still, we
should not forget that the environ-
ment is the foundation upon which
all occupation ultimately rest. A
“no" vote on next @sday’s
referendum is the only vote that
can possibly say “yes" to the
future of jobs and quality life in
Allegheny County.

Letter Chronicles Further History of «Zimbabwe Movement

There is a long history of
resistance to colonialism and
neo-colonialism in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia). The heroic struggles of
the Shona and Ndebele peoples,
barbarically defeated by the British
oolonialists in 1898, give the name
to today’s armed struggle in
Zimbabwe—Chimurenga (revolu-
tion). But there are many reasons
why the struggle against the racist
Ian Smith regime has become an
armed struggle.

From 1943 to 1964, many black
people formed political organiza-
tions in order to win reforms from
the white settler government.
Most notably, Joshua Nkomo
traveled around the world, trying to
get foreign countries to apply
pressure to change conditions in
Rhodesia from the outside. , Nkomo
spent most of his time in airplanes
between London, Washington and
the United Nations in these
unsuccessful wanderings.

The people of Zimbabwe grew
tired of waiting for the messiah of

international support to come, tired
of seeing the Smith regime grow
stronger despite their boycotts and
economic strugles. They began
organizing for a forcible change in
Rhodesia. In 1963, therewas a
split in Nkomo’s organization,
ZAPU (Zimbabwe African Peoples
Union), and a new group was
formed: ZANU(Zimbabwe African
National Union). Between 1964
and 1974, ZANU built up a
Liberation Army, ZANLA, and
began waging a people’s war in the
countryside.

In 1976, ZANU and ZAPU joined
forces in a patriotic front to ﬁght as
an integrated military unit against
imperialism. Both groups retain
their identity, but together they
constitute an unstoppable alliance
for revolution. The Organization
for African Unity and the front line
states recognize the Patriotic Front
as the sole representative of the
Zimbabwean people.

The military wing of the Patriotic
Front is ZIPA (Zimbabwean Peo-

  RSA Scares Up Money For UnitedWay

."’ p
.r ‘at .

r-4?‘

By JOHN RIGHETTI

“Chiller Theater” became reality
1aSt Week, With the opening of Pitt’s
haunted house.

The haunted house, held Wed-
nesday, Thursday and Friday from
7:30 to 11 p.m. at an old church on
South Bouquet Street, was spon-
sored by the Resident Student
Association (RSA). Admission was
a 50 cent donation to the United
Way.

Keith Wassum, area coordinator
for Tower B, coordinated the
project, created and run entirely by
students. The funding came from
RSA. though much of the materials
and supplies were donated by
participants and other residents.

This year’s house was an
immense improvement over last
years which was held on the 22nd
floor of TowerjB, due to the
atmosphere of the old church.

Approafching the ivy-covered
church, one saw no signs of life;
rather, one saw signs of death. The
front yard, overgrown with grass
and weeds, was adorned with

-tombstones (they didn't come with

the church). The ﬁnal one, in front
of the doors, warned “You are
next.”

After passing through the large
oak doors, a group of 10 people
stood in the dimly lit vestibule,
waiting and listening to screeches
that echoed through the building's
stairways. The inner doors swung
open, and the group entered a
large, dark room.

Here, a young woman, bathed in
purple light, tried to claw her way
out of a glass cofﬁn as bats and
ghosts swung down from the

.tr‘fv~‘t;,__rafters. Following a seance by
' white-robed Satan worshippers, the

Prince of Evil himself appeared,
sporting a pitchfork and accom-
panied by a strobe light and eerie
organ music.

One young woman was electro-
cuted before the spectators; another
ran screaming through the room as
a man in a black robe rose from a
coffin.

As if this wasn't enough to put
fear in one’s heart, the group then
was led to Hell’s Kitchen, where to
slimy women attempted to force a
meal of bloody bones at the tourists.
In the adjacent room sat a witch at a
crystal ball; the eyes of the portrait
above her moved to and fro.

FI‘0m here, the group traveled
down a narrow, rotting spiral
staircase to a dirt ﬂoor cellar.
There, hunchbacked Igor dug
graves by candlelight as his master
chased the unsuspecting crowd up
the stairs.

A spiral staircase, leading to the
main part of the church, was next.
Spiders and Cobwebs hung from the
ceiling in a room that displayed
more tombstones. Finally, the
group was led by witches, past a
guillotined body, to the main room.
It was pitch black.

First in the series of tortures was
a journey through a plastic jungle
and a swamp, where unseen ghouls
screamed and grabbed. Then, the
highlight of the house: the tunnel.
here there was no group solidarity;
each person had to journey through
alone, crawling in total darkness
through a tunnel three feet high.
Hands reached in, screams pierced
the air, and a creature with chains
danced on the roof. The stay
seemed an eternity.

After the tunnel exit, one section
lay ahead——the walk to the exit of
the house. The group has broken
into bands of two or three,
each followed by a creature who
breathed down their necks. A
screeching witch led the way to the
slide that led out of the house.

The flavor of Halloween has
caught on at Pitt, and the haunted
house is destined to become another
tradition.

dark, somewhere in the dimly-lit
corner a voice crys out “Help me!”
What are these things that creak
and go bump in the night?

Halloween is the uneasy time of
year when, for many, dormant
fascination of the unknown is
aroused. Any other day, a tap-
ping at an upstairs window is
merely a tree branch, that low
moaning is created by the wind.
Tonight, imagination take the place
of logic and those strange noises
could be made by just about
anything (or anyone.)

An abandoned church would
seem, an unlikely candidate for
transformation into a haunted
house. The Pitt Resident Student

Hands reach out in the‘

Association (RSA) could not have
asked for a better building. The
church, located near the law
complex, has a cold, foreboding air
about it. Set upon a high, sharply
banked hill, the haunted house
overlooks a street cluttered with
curious students who are waiting in
line to see what is creating those
muffled screams and thuds emina-
ting from within the stone structure.
Occasional], strange looking
people meander around the line of
students. One white-faced char-
acter, simply dress in a hooded gray
sweatshirt and jeans passes
throughout the crowd unnoticed
until spotting a likely looking victim
(usually female). He then proceeds,
with deadpan expression, to latch
onto her arm a la Frankenstein.
This particular victim laughs
nerviously as her freinds kid her.
Others react with indifference, but
many of the women scream. When

one ghoulish ﬁgure started down
the steps toward a woman, she
panicked and hid behind a couple of
friends.

Upon entering the haunted
house, visitors are grouped to-
gether, shown a pair of wooded
doors and asked by the sweatshirted
resident, “Who wants to go ﬁrst?”
Laughing, one brave soul conﬁdent-
ly strides to the door and opens it.

But to everyone’s surprise, and‘

perhaps disappointment, nothing
jumps out. The room, however, is
suddenly alive with ﬂashing lights
glowing cofﬁns, sparkly wires and,
amid the electrical confusion,
several young shrieking women
dance, veiled in ﬂowing, white
material.

Lucifer makes a guest appear-
ance and sends the dancers into a
frenzy as they circulate among the

crowd, giving a push to one visitor,

needed. She pushed, diplomatical-
ly pulling a string here, a string
there. She approached high-rank-
ing University administrative of-
ﬁcials—in an attempt to get
women’s sports at Pitt on the level
where it could raise enough revenue
to be self-supportive.

Today, thanks to Bullman’s
perseverance and drive, the Pitt’s
women's sports program is opera-
ting under a budget that generates
several hundreds of dollars of
revenue a year

This is a good example of the way
times are changing in women’s
sports throughout the country.

Women’s sports in America have
changed to where they could be
considered as the nation’s newest

million dollar baby-,-that’s how

much money they’re generating a
year.

More changes could take place as
soon as next January, when the big
wheels within the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW), the main governing body
in women’s sports today, meet at its
next annual convention in Atlanta.
The convention possibly could

produce even more revenue for the
growing program.

One of the biggest changes
discussed nationally, and one that
probably will be among the major
items on the agenda at next
J anuary’s meeting, is the proposal
to incorporate the AIAW and the
National Collegiate Athletic Assoc-

“We can’t very well split the big
schools and small schools,” Spra-

State, for example. It’s a relatively
small scholl, but it has one of the
most outstanding women’s basket-
ball programs in the nation. It’s
coming to a point where the two

Anthropo|ogy.15 Social Issues, Cultural Perspectives (3 credits)
Winter Term, 1977-1978 Instructed by Anthropology Faculty
Tuesdays and Thursdays 1-1 :50 (Room 120 David Lawrence Hall)

Matters of immediate interest to Pittsburgh and of wider social importance will be considered by
a team of faculty from the perspective of anthropology. '
The topics include:

Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Mysteries of Civilization

The Last Frontier: Survival from the Sea

Stress: Behavior, Disease, and Ongoing Evolution

Cross-Cultural and Local Perspectives on Illness and Health

Sex Roles: Biological, Evolutionary, and Cultural Determinants

The Failure of the American High School

Salvaging the Judicial System: Moot Courts

Eastern Religions, Western Needs

Cults and Contemporary Religious Movements

Black Ghetto Culture: An Inside Perspective

Can Americans Change their Driving Habits?

Drug Use in Cultural Perspective

Many of the topics will be illustrated with slides or films, and some topics may be presented by
panel discussion or debate. A major objective is to provide a deeper and broader understanding of
social concerns that are profoundly important and intrinsically interesting. Another goal is to
become aquainted with a sampling of the ways by which anthropologists seek an understanding of
important issues through biological, evolutionary, and comparative cultural perspectives. Students
will have an opportunity to discuss each of the topics in small, informal discussion groups.

\\ \\

Readings: No required text, but short readings selected for particular topics and recommen-
ded, but not required, additional readings. . ‘

Examinations: One midterm and a final exam.

Bullman said. “If it weren’t for the
men here at Pitt, we probabaly
wouldn’t even have a women’s
program. We’re one team working
together. We aren’t ﬁghting each
other. That wouldn’t be a very
realistic thing to do.”

women’s sports,” Matheson add-

Bullman, Sprague and Matheson do

“Women today are getting better
basics, better fundamentals,’ ‘Spra-
gue said. “I have no problems at
all. As far as scheduling women’s
events here at Pitt, I’ve run into a
few problems between wrestling
and track. But we've been able to
reason out our differences. Teh
situation, so far, has been good.”

enthusiastically. “-There isn’t

The future for women’s sports?
Just as fundamentally sound as the
past seemed to have been.

key to the success of women’s
sports in the years ahead.

Energy. It is a crucial ingredient
that a slapstick comedy like “A
Funny Thing Happened On the Way
to the Forum” needs in order to
work. In the University of
Pittsburgh Theater’s production of
Larry Gelbart’s and Burt Sheve-
love’s hilarious play, that ingred-
ient is ever-present.

The stage seems to seeth with
energy from the entire cast that,
inspired by an overwhelmingly
beautiful and artistic set and
creative and appropriate costumes,
is hellbent on entertaining its

_ audience.

The plot itself has nointended
moral (“...the moral is—comedy
tonight” the entire cast sings in its
ﬁnale); it is intentionally ridiculous,
with twists and turns at every point.
The story is simple: the slave
Pseudolus (Ronald A. Wisniski)
must join Hero (Robert Grosch), his

Rod Stewart otters music that creates a widespread appeal, as could be seen
during his concert this weekend at the Civic Arena. He provided a top rate

master and Philia (Patty Pelcz), a
beautiful Cretan maiden sold to
captain Miles Gloriousus (Chris-
topher Hensel), together and help
them flee Rome so they can marry.
In exchange for this service,
Pseudolus would receive his
freedom.

But one problem leads to another,
and yet another, until all of the
characters are madly chasing one
another in a tremendous chase
scene that is the frenzied climax of
the work.

Wisniski has a certain sarcastic,
plotting air about him as Pseudous,
a needed air if the characterization
is intended to be understood.
Although he was a bit shaky in the
opening seliloquy and first song as
far as delivery was concerned,
Wisniski steadily improved the rest
of the way until all his quips brought
laughter from the audience.

Pelcz was dainty as Philia, the
moralistic beauty. She has a
beautiful voice that provided a nice

 

   

DOLOMITE

change from the comic songs of
clever Stephen Sondheim. Plecz
was angelic and innocent, thus
portraying her character appro-
priately.

Grosch was boyish and provided
the right amount of the “Oh, gosh”
look here needed, Hensel, as his
opposite, was dashing and debonair
as.the man-about-town Miles
Gloriosus.

Hysterium, Pseudolus’s gnomic
co-slave and co-conspirator, came
to life in the form of Charlie
Heckathome, who had every line
and movement perfect, especially in
his solo, “I’m Not Nervous.”

Mark Selvaggie was a hit as the
dirty old man Senex, especially in
the song, “Everybody Ought to
have A Maid.” His voice was lusty
and colorful. His rendition received
applause before the tune was over.

As for the other cast members,
Todd Yohn (Erronius) was excellent
as the ancient citizen who had to
climb the seven hills seven times to
free his home of “ghosts” and
William J. McLaughlin was good as
Lycus, the owner of a house of ill
repute.

Lisa Bansavage (Domina) needed
more volume .in her solo, but was
ﬁne otherwise as the domineering
wife. The Proteans (Mark
McWhinney, Scott A. Mortimer and

  

Set designer Henry Heymann’s talents helped to create an affective comic

build up in “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.”

Lousi P. Taylor) were hilarious as
the Roman Three Stooges and were
impressively ridiculous.

The dancing was average, and
more could have been done with the
routines of the Courtesans.
Although they were pretty, a much
better and more lasting impression
could have been made with more
intricate steps.

Plecz, Heckathome and Se1vag-
gie sang their numbers well, but the
rest of the songs suffered one way or
the other. either by lack gt volume:
fading at the end of a lyric, or
off-key singing. Although not a

Always known for this high
degree of perforrner-audience inter-
action, Stewart mixed it with the
crowd, swigging wine from a pouch
thrown to him from the front row,
accepting hand-painted signs and
roses and kicking a dozen soccer
balls into the crowd during his
ﬁnale, “Stay With Me.”

The sloppy musicianship that
plagued Stewart when he was still

When the Faces were on, it was
magic but, more often than not, the
band was out of tune and just plain
sloppy, with Stewart’s unbeatable
charisma, instead of the music
carrying the act. Now he has it
both ways.

His new band, as players of both
Stewart’s originals and his ﬁnely
crafted cover versions, couldn’t be
touched by the Faces.

Fresh-faced quitarist Gary Grain-

English outfit, Strider, and ﬁzzy-
haired guitarist Jim Cregan, once of
Cockney Rebel, were outstanding

hit. “Maggie May.” “Tonight’s

“The Killing of Georgie.”

Bassist Phil Chen and drummer

“I Know I’m Losing You“ before
Appice broke into a solo enhancing
his reputation as one of rock's most
innovative drummers.

Stewart works great with the
band onstage and one could feel
the close and refreshing camara-
derie present, where Stewart is the
unquestioned star but where the
others are allowed to have their
solo moments and talents apprec-
iated.

The precise and exciting sound
of the band’s playing served to
highlight Stewart’s unique vocal
style: hoarse and masculine, with a
vulnerable and heartfelt personna.

Stewart, always powerful and
stylish as a stage performer, seems
to have somehow improved his
voice to the point where he can sing
lyrical story-ballads, especially on
his slew of current AM hits,
“Tonight’s the Night,” “The
Killing of Georgie” (Stewart
singing with cape on under a
lamplight prop) and “First Cut is
the Deepest.”

Clad in a black satin jump suit
and ballet slippers, Stewart’s
athletic grace and stage appeal
showed why he is often regarded as
one of rock’s top performers.

Although he is 32, Stewart still

has the moves of the gangly
English schoolboy soccer star, he
once was. This shows, especially
when the talented and seasoned
Stewart works a crowd.

On the harder numbers he ran
from side to side, leading the
enthusiatic crowd in cheers,
twirling his mike ,moving to the
music in well-choreograped spins.

With the sucess of the “Night on
the Town” album and the monster
single, “Tonight’s the Night,”
Stewart’s appeal is growing among
women in their late teen and early
twenties. Previously, his boozing
antics endeared him mostly to the
men in attendance.

Even when he shakes his
derriere for the women, however,
the men aren’t aliented, because of
his foppish attitudes.

Stewart has a good-time onstage
and although his rock’n’ roll
numbers can get gritty, they’re not
malicious. This spread to the
crowd and everybody left well
entertained. After all, what more
could one ask from a night on the
town?

Opening for Stewart was a new
band from England, Air Supply.

Its first album has yet to be‘

released but it did warm the crowd
effectively with various soft-rock
numbers combined with a pleasant
and reserved stage presence.

It was a day for record breaking,
as three Panthers set team marks to
help ‘Pitt blast the Green Wave of
Tulane, 48-0, at Pitt Stadium
Saturday.

Gordon Jones, Bob Jury and Matt
Cavanaugh all found their way into
the Pitt record book, and the
Panthers mixed an awesome
offensive display with a staunch
defensive showing to raise their
season record to 6-1-1.

Jury’s ﬁrst of two interceptions
from his free safety position made
him Pitt’s career interception

W leader, and paved the way for the

Panthers’ second shutout of the
year. Jury’s second theft raised his
career total to 16, and Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill awarded the senior a
game ball for his efforts.

While Jury was making things
happen defensively. the offensive
sparkplugs had the Cavnaught-to
Jones trademark. Jones, who also
received a game ball, caught only

three passes for 29 years, but two of
those grabs were in the Tulane end
zone. The first one tied a Panther
milestone of 16 career touchdown
catches, and the second placed
Jones in a category all by himself.

The cast-free Cavanaugh only
played for 25 minutes, but that was
all it took for him to make Pitt
history. The senior ﬁeld general
completed 10 of 16 passes for 149
yards and two touchdowns, both to
Jones. The second toss equalled a
Pitt career mark of 21 touchdown
passes.

 
 

Quarterback Matt Cavanaugh got into the Pitt books by throwing two

touchdown passes in the 25 minutes he played against the Tulane Green

Wave, thus equalling the old Panther mark.

As senior fullback Elliot Walker
watched his teammates break one
record after another, he was his
usual brilliant self, carrying the ball
13 times for H9 yards and two
touchdowns.

Pitt treated a youth day crowd of
46,273 by buildingtup 334-O half
time lead that enabled Sherrill to
use 86 of 88 players. Tulane coach
Larry Smith summed it up nicely in
a dejected Green Wave locker room
after the game, “Pitt played good.
basic football.”

It was good basic football to the
tune of 451 total offensive yards,
while holding Tulane to 194 and
forcing six turnovers. A pretty good
job, considering all the injuries that
had Sherrill pacing the floor all
week long.

It would have taken sidelining
injuries to the entire Pitt squad to
deny the Panthers a victory over the
Green Wave. Crucial defensive
stands by Pitt thwarted Tulane
drives on two occassions, and the
only serious scoring threats the
Wave could muster were in the form
ofmissed field goal tries of 56 and 51
yards. .

The first Panther score was set up
when flanker Randy Reutershan
pulled in the first of his four catches
for a 37-yard gain to the Tulane 11.
Three plays later, Jones put a dandy
of a move on halfback Phil
Townsend in ‘the end zone for an
eight-yard scoring catch. Mark
Schubert kicked the first of four
extra points and Pitt led, 7-0.

On the ensuing series, Tulane
quarterback Roch Honatas tossed
an errant pass to the left ﬂat, where
Panther Mike Blazer was waiting to
pull in the football and gallop 29
yards into the end zone, giving Pitt a
l4-point first-quarter lead.

The Panther’s next possession
netted them 70 yards and a
touchdown with Walker picking up

scampered past the goal line to
make it 28-0 with 3:07 gone in the
second quarter.

Jury’s first interception set up
the next Panther score—-a l3-yard
strike from Cavanaugh to Jones that
placed both names in the Pitt
record book. Schubert missed the
point after and Pitt led at the half,
34-0.

A familiar nuisance-—turnovers-
nearly got Pitt in trouble in the third
period, when a Rick Trocano
interception and a Rooster Jones
fumble challenged the Panthers’
shutout bid. But the defense held
and caused two fumbles of its own to
calm all worries.

Pitt’s offense and defense
exchanged touchdowns in the
fourth quarter. The offense took the
initiative by marching 36 yards for
a score, topped off by a three-yard
effort by Trocano. Dave Trout
added the point that made the
score 41-0.

Backup defender Ricky Jackson
followed with an interception on
Tulane’s next possession and
rambled 48 yards to paydirt. Trout
kicked his second point to ﬁnalize
the scoring at 10:22 of the fourth
quarter.

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt’s 48 points
would be enough to make any coach
happy, but maybe the greatest
pleasure for Sherrill was only one
Panther fumble. “That makes mea
helluve lot happier,” he said...
Sherrill needs one more win this
year to become the most usccessful
first-ytéar coach at Pitt in the last 50
years...The Panther defense hasn't
surrendered a touchdown in the
first quarter this season...Saturday
was the first time Pitt ever has
defeated Tulane.

Records Break Wave In Pitt Win

Jury ‘Roars’ to Record

By PATTY‘ TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s 48-0 rout of Tulane was a

, game made for smashing records,

and while Gordon Jones’s and Matt
Cavanaugh’s contributions to Pitt’s
record books were certainly deserv-
ing of acclaim, neither equaled the
roar of applause Bob Jury received
when the senior defenseman snared
a Green Wave pass and snapped
Carl DePasqua’s record of 14 career
interceptions, which had stood for
years.

Actually, Jury himself was
having a few doubts as to when he'd
be listed in the record books.

“I was really starting to wonder
about it,” he said. “I hadn’t caught
any passes for a while.”

The last team Pitt playked that
relied on the aerial attack was
Boston College, four weeks before,
when Jury tied the record. Florida,
Navy and Syracuse favored the
/ground game, and it was.beginning
to look like J ury's chances were
becoming remote.

“The day before the game, I told
my girlfriend Vicki I felt I was going
to break it,” he said. “They
(Tulane) were a passing team, and I
ﬁgured I’d have a good chance. I
had a lot of conﬁdence and I guess
the Lord was with me.”

Pre-game tensions and appre-
hensions aside, Jury focused his

Cavanaugh and Jones
Hook Up for Pitt Marks

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Everytime Matt Cavanaugh com-
pletes a pass, the new scoreboard
at Pitt Stadium says, “Cavanaugh
Connection.”

Saturday afternoon, the score-
board at Pitt Stadium ﬂashed the
message on 10 different occasions.
Cavanaugh completed 10 of 16
passes for 149 yards, including two
touchdown passes to junior split
end Gordon Jones, in Pitt’s 48-0
whitewash of Tulane.

But Cavanaugh’s second touch-
down pass to Jones, (just like his
first scoring completion to Jones
earlier in the game) was more than
just another “Cavanaugh Connec-
tion.” -

This completion had a two-way
hookup with the Pitt record book.

By catching the pass, Jones,
(who earlier in the game tied the
record set by Joe Walton nearly 30
years ago) became the all-time Pitt
career touchdown reception leader,
with 16. By completing the pass,
Cavanaugh also put his name in the
Pitt record book.

Cavanaugh’s touchdown toss,
the 21st in his illustrious career at
Pitt, tied a record set by Dave

“It was just a short post
pattern,”Jones said, explaining his

record-shattering catch. ‘‘It wasn’t
supposed to go as far as it did. But
Matt just threw it and I caught it.”

“Gordon had to change his
original route,’ ’Cavanaugh added.

“He had to come back and catch’-,.

the ball. I scrambled and lead him
through, hoping he would catch the
ball.’’

Which Jones did, just as he
nabbed his record-tying touchdown
reception from Canvanaugh earlier
in the afternoon.

“The first pass was a comeback
route,” Jones said. “The defender
turned, so I jumped on the outside
and Matt delivered the ball. The
ball was there. I had no trouble
catching it.”

Jones, who along with Cava-
naugh sat out the second half,
caught only one other pass that

afternoon for a seven-yard gain."

Although Cavanaugh might not
have found Jones all that often, two
of the three times he found his
explosive split end open, it meant
something special. These were
more than ordinary “Cavanaugh
Connect1ons”——-they had a special
hookup to the Pitt record book.

Haygood Looks to Future

Want to know the real reason former Pitt
quarterback Robert Haygood isn’t playing
football this year for the Panthers?

Haygood, now a guard on the Pitt basketball
team, wants to become a professional athlete
after he graduates. '

Sounds confusing? Well, it really isn’t as
illogical as it first appears. Haygood feels that
by concentrating solely on basketball (in past
years, he has played both basketball and
football on the varsity level at Pitt), he can
overcome the biggest obstacle holding him back

This is proving the knee he seriously injured
early last football season is strong again.

“The injured leg was the biggest factor in
making the decision to switch from football to

or basketball.

basketball,” Haygood explained. ‘‘In
basketball, you’re making deeper cuts and
running more than what you normally do
playing football.

“Doing this,” the senior continued, “should
show people that I am healthy—that the knee’s
back in shape.”

The people who have the most interest in
I-laygood’s knee are the pro scout-s, who judge
whether or not a prospective athlete has what it
takes to play pro ball. Past history shows
scouts are leery of athletes with knee problems,
unless they have the talent of a Joe Namath. So
Haygood has a lot to prove before he gets his
chance to play for pay.

And he knows it. But he’s worked—it wasn’t
easy getting the log back in shape. Many days
were spent running miles and miles around the
Tartan Track at Pitt Stadium, while his ex-
teammates practiced football. It seemed
strange he was running, trying to get the knee
healthy for hznitt-lhztil season, while football
practice was in r’ iszrcss, ’

with some unidentified representative from the
football squad about returning while Matt
Cavanaugh was out indefinitely with his
infamous broken left wrist.

Even then, it was a situation where Haygood
felt he had to help out, not a case where he
really wanted to. ,

‘‘I thought about coming back,” Haygood
said with a grin, “believe me, I thought about it
when Matt got hurt. But I’m a man of my
word._ 1 like to stick with a decision once I
make it. After I suffered the knee injury, 1
made up my mind that it would strictly be
basketball from now on in.

“No more football, unless I got the chance to

playitprofessionally.”  .3, _
If Haygood is given a shot at professionar’ ‘

ball, it probably will be in football. Small by
National Basketball Association (NBA)
standards (nowadays, who really wants a 5-10,
170-pound point guard when you can get them
in economy 6-2 and jumbo 6-4, 6-5 and 6-6
sizes?), Haygood is ideal of professional
football standards.

More than one scout has said Haygood
would make either the perfect cornerback or
safety. And not so surprisingly, playing
basketball should strengthen Haygood’s-

chances of being drafted by some Natiortﬁ

Football League (NFL) team.

The NFL’s past track record of basketball
players who have made a successful transition
to pro football has been excellent. Dallas
Cowboy running back Preston Pearson, who
has been splitting halfback duties with Tony
Dorsett for the Cowboys this year, never played
college football at Illinois. Yet the ex-
basketball player is one of the most consistent
runners in the game today. He must be, since
even super rookie Dorsett hasn’t been able to
kick him completely out of the Dallas offensive
backfield.

Tulane head football coach Larry

in a game where his team was
out-rushed 293 yards to 152,
out-passed 173 yards to 93.
out-gained 451 yards to 194,
out-scored 48 points to zero, and
totally out-played.

he snapped. “I didn’t think we did

A...” well at all--we played decent in the
‘ second half, but that’s all. By that

time, it was a little too late.”

The most gut-ripping fact of the
game was that Tulane’s lack of
success came against a Panther
team that not only was suffering
from injuries—Hugh Green, Dave
DiCiccio, Matt Carroll and Willie

Taylor were replaced by subs Steve
Fedell, Mike Balzer, Mark May.
and Randy Reutershan—but a‘
Panther team that sent out its
second string as soon as the second
quarter, when Pitt had huge 34-O
advantage.

“We had no offense at all
today,” Smith complained. “They
(Pitt) kept scoring, but that was a
combination of them playing very
well and us playing no offensive
football at all.”

To get his team moving, Smith
replaced standout quarterback
Rock Hontas with freshman Carl
Hall, but it was futile. When the
Wave ﬁnally did threaten to score
something, some way, somehow,‘
two consecutive fumbles killed any
hopes for a decent showing. And
all the while, head football coach
Larry Smith stood on the side-

lines—through the measly 13 ﬁrst
downs, through the 20-point
second quarter, through a disap-
pointing 2-6 season.

“We had no execution," he said.
“I thought Hall would be able to

get us something going—that he
could at least get us on the board,

but...

“Hontas was I00 percent physi-
cally, but not execution-wise.

Such a demoralizing loss erases
any good points gained in the
games prior to, or after, the
demoralization.

“We play Miami of Florida
(beaten by Penn State, 49-7) next
week,” Smith said with a laugh.
“Your could call it the ‘Blown-Out
Bowl,’ I guess.”

Which is disgusting.

Boaters‘ Playoff Hopes Smashed

By JEFF DUROSKO A

,9. , Lock Haven dealt the Pitt soccer

team a crucial 2-1 loss Friday
afternoon on their home turf. The
loss probably puts the Panthers out
of contention for an NCAA playoff
berth, and lowers their record to
6-5-1.

The teams were scoreless at
halftime, as both had trouble
keeping their footing on a slippery
ﬁeld. The Eagles scored their ﬁrst
goal on a penalty kick by Dave
Connors three minutes into the
second half. The Panthers
countered on a 23-yard shot by
John O’Hara three minutes later.
The winning goal was scored by

"Q'Fim Jones with about 12 minutes

left in the game, and the Panthers
just couldn’t come back.

“I think we played well and we
moved the ball well but we just
couldn’t penetrate,” Pitt coach Leo
Bemis said after the game. “We
didn’t play well in the ﬁrst half, but
that was due to the poor ﬁeld
conditions . ’ ’

The Panthers will face the Penn
State Nittany Lions Tuesday night
at University Park. The Lions are
ranked sixth in the country and ﬁrst
in the East.

“We have a tough week ahead of
us, having to meet both Penn State
and West Virginia in ﬁve days,”
said Bemis. “They (Penn State) are
a very powerful club, and should be
8-2 when they play us. They have
had ﬁve or six shutouts in a row, and
the game will be one of our toughest
this season.”

If the Panther booters can knock
off the Nittanies on Tuesday and
win their remaining two games, an
NCAA playoff spot is possible-—but
not probable.

Pitt Spikers Lose the Salisbury Stake
With Third-Place Finish In Delaware

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pantherette volleyball team
failed to defend its title at the
Salisbury State Invitational this
weekend in Delaware.

East Stroudsberg was the winner
.. the nine-team round robin
arnament with the best record.
Virginia Commonwealth was sec-
ond, and Pitt ﬁnished third.

The Pantherettes compiled. a 6-2
record, and raised their season total

Tuesday, the Pitt women's cross
country team will compete in its
last meet of the regular season
against Allegheny Community Col-
lege (ACC)at Schenley Park.

This meet should be interesting
from both team and individual
standpoints. Pitt raced against
ACC a week ago at the Pitt
Invitational and beat ACC by only
30 points. The point spread should

5 be much closer Tuesday; since this
5:75» only a dual meet.

From the individual viewpoint, it
will be interesting to see if Brenda
Chorpenning will be able to ﬁnish
ahead of Becky Falck. Until two
weeks ago Falck always lead the

land that eliminated Pitt from the
Eastern Regionals last year.

The Pantherette losses were to
the first and second place
tournament ﬁnishers, East Strouds-
berg and Virginia Commonwealth.

Eastern Regionals are three
weeks away, and Pitt head coach
Mike Hebert isn't satisﬁed. “I
though we played well,” he said,
“but I really thought’ we should
have won.”

Hebert emphasized he didn’t see
any problems, but he noted several
factors responsible for Pitt’s poorer

, showing this season.

“We’re not playing worse than
last year,” he said. “In fact, we're
playing much better. The reason

. Pantherettes Prepare

Pitt runners. But last week, in a
meet at Slippery Rock, Chorpen-
ning surprised everyone by coming
from behind to edge Falck in the
last 880 yards of the race.

“She was ahead of me when we
started the last 880 yards,“
Chorpenning said, “and I thought I
could catch her because I run the
880-yard dash in track. I just
started running faster.”

At the Pitt Invitational, four days
after the Slippery Rock meet, Falck
beat Chorpenning. It's anyone’s
guess who will come out ahead this
week.

The rivalry between Falck and
Chorpenning is conﬁned to the
ﬁeld; they are good friends. What
happens during a race merely

our record doesn't show our
improvement is the level of
competition has increased greatly
this year.

Hebert added many teams play
better against Pitt because it has
established itself as a top team, and
every team wants to upset it.

“I was proud of the team's
performance,” said Hebert,” but I
stil1don’t think we are playing with
full conﬁdence.

‘ ‘The championship of the East is
up for grabs," he said, “and any
one of eight teams could take it. We
are going to be working very hard
for the next three weeks; and, if we
peak for that weekend, we can win

‘ 99

for ACC

represents the striving of both
women toward excellence.

These two runners are by no
means the only talent on the Pitt
'team—the other women are close

on the heels of the leaders. Maybe
this will be the meet in which one of
them will come from behind.

SPOR IS!

For Career Interceptions

didn’t think about the record too
much”—-and midway through the
second quarter, Tulane quarterback
Roch Hontas took aim and ﬁred the
bomb into J ury’s waiting hands.

“I was on cloud nine,” Jury said.

In the fourth quarter, Jury put his
newly-won record even further
beyond the grasp of future Pitt
defensemen, when he picked off a
second Hontas pass, upping his
total to 16.

Best of all, with three games
remaining in the regular season,
Jury’s got a good chance to extend
his total even more.

“That second interception made
me feel even better,” Jury said.
“The fact that I got two——it made
me feel really\good.

“The rest of the season looks
good,” he continued. “Most of
them (West Virginia, Army and
Penn State) are passing teams.
Things could be falling a lot more
my way.” _

Jury made it clear he's not
headed for any post-record-breab
ing slump.

“In fact, I went out to play that
much harder against Tulane,” he
said. “One thing I don’t want to do
is have a letdown.”

Power Politics Could Keep
Pitt Poloists From Playoffs

By BOB LABRIOLA

The Pitt water polo team’s
chances for a bid to the NCAA
Championships may be snuffed by
power politics.

Pitt was scheduled to travel to
New Haven this weekend to
participate in the Yale Invitational
to face the top teams from New
England, but had its invitation
cancelled at the last minute. Both‘
Pitt coach Miguel Rivera and
Slippery Rock coach Richard
Hunkler, who is the eastern
conference secretary suspect poli-
tics may be involved.

“I got a phone call from the Yale
coach and he told me that he
thought since the championship of
the tournament was to be played
Sunday at 6 p.m. it would be
dangerous for us to make such a
long trip so late at night,” Rivera

said.

This year, for the first time, the
New England Conference has
declined to participate in the
Easterns, traditionally the qualiﬁer
for the NCAA Championships.
Although the winner of the
Easterns has usually received-the
NCAA bid, the NCAA also has a
three-member board that has ﬁnal
say in awarding the berths.

Hunkler and Rivera suspect
Brown Universtiy may be avoiding
the Easterns in the hope not
playing looks better to the board
than playing and losing. Hunkler
believes Brown has been avoiding
Pitt and Bucknell this year in an
effort to compile an impressive
regular season record.

This tactic is given added clout
since Ed Reed, Brown’s coach, also
sits on the three-member NCAA
board. The other two members are
the coaches from Long Beach State
and Southern California.

To compensate for the vacancies
created by the New England teams

representatives from the South-
eastern and Midwest Conferences

will be included in the Easterns this ‘

year.

“I’m still conﬁdent that whoever
wins E-asterns will get the bid to the
NCAA Championships,” Rivera
said. “We feel we can beat Brown
anytime, in any pool, if they would
just stop avoiding us.”

Steelers Bucked By Colts, 31 -21 C,

BALTIMORE (AP)—Bert Jones
threw for two touchdowns and ran
for another, Baltimore intercepted
ﬁve passes, and the Colts defeated
the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-2!
Sunday.

The surprisingly easy victory
gave the Colts the lead in National
Football League’s AFC East, one
game ahead of the Miami Dolphins,
and dropped the Steelers one game
behind the_ Cleveland Browns in the
the AFC ‘Central.

Jones connected on his ﬁrst seven
passes, including TD tosses of 26
yards to Roosevelt Leaks and 13
yards to Lydell "Mitchell. as
Baltimore took a 17-0 halftime lead.

The two scores followed inter-
ceptions. Another interception on
the ﬁrst play of the second half
setup a 25-yard scoring run by Ron
Lee, and Jones skirted left and for a
6 yard touchdown following the
second of linebacker Stan White's
interceptions in the fourth quarter.

game Sunday.

The Browns, 5-2, totally domi-

Cleveland’s rugged defensive

The Chiefs’ managed only 61

i0l’ManUpset Grabs So

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Has anyone seen 01’ Man Upset?
The unwelcome old goblin stayed
away from most of the nation’s Top
Ten college football teams over the
weekend, but, just when it
appeared he really was on vacation,
he lowered the boom on 10th-ranked
Southern California.

The Trojans, embarrassing 49-19
losers to Notre Dame a week ago,
made it closer this time but still
bowed 17-14 to an inspired
University of California team.

It was USC’s ﬁrst Paciﬁc-8
Conference setback in two seasons
and dropped the defending champ-
ion Trojans into a second-place tie
with Washington and UCLA,
one—half game behind 4-1 Stanford.

“We’re a very much uptight team
right now,” said coach John
Robinson, whose Trojans have
dropped three of their last four
starts. “gut we're still in the Rose
Bowl race. We’re 3-1, and if we win
the rest of our, games we’ll go to the
Rose Bowl.”

Meanwhile, top-rated Texas
belted No. 14 Texas Tech, 26-0,
runner-up Alabama trounced Miss-
issippi State, 37-7, third-ranked
Ohio State blitzed Wisconsin, 42-0,
No. 4 Oklahoma ﬂattened Kansas

State, 42-7, and ﬁfth-ranked Notre
Dame drubbed Navy, 43-10.

Meanwhile, sixth-ranked Mich-
igan trimmed Iowa, 23-6, No. 7
Kentucky blanked Virginia Tech,
32-0, eighth-rated Arkansas down-
ed Rice, 30-7, and No. 9 Penn State
mauled Miami of Florida, 49-7.

In the Second Ten, No. 11 Texas
A&M outlasted Southern Method-
ist, 38-21, No. 12 Nebraska kayoed
Oklahoma State, 31-14, No. 13 Pitt
blasted Tulane, 48-0, No. 16
Clemson stopped Wake Forest,
26-0, No. 17 Brigham Young beat
Arizona, 34-14, and No. 20 Florida
State turned back North Texas
State, 35-14. But Missouri upset No.
15 Colorado, 24-14, Auburn suprised
No. 18 Florida, 29-14, and Indiana
shocked No. 19 Minnesota, 34-22.

The USC-Cal game began with a
tribute to the late Joe Roth, the Cal
quarterback who died of cancer
following the 1976 season, and
ended with a fourth-period ﬁght
that left some bitter feelings.

“There's a special feeling and
respect we have for Joe,” said Cal
Coach Mike White. ‘ ‘He wasn’t the
soap-box type of guy or ﬂag-waver.
We had a moment of silence before
we went on the ﬁeld and each
individual honored Joe in his own
way. It was a silent tribute, not one

of those ‘win-on-for-the-Gipper’
type of things.”
The ﬁght broke out when Charles

jWhite, USC’s star tailback, was

knocked out of bounds came up
swinging against Cal defenders.

“When one of my kids is on the
ground and gets hit in the mouth, he
has every reason to retaliate,”
Robinson said.

Both sides drew‘ personal fouls,
but Robinson put the blame on the
Golden Bears. ’

“We played against a group
that's been penalized all year,” he
said. “Look at the record. Cal leads
the conference in penalties.”

Texas used a 57-yard pass play
from Randy McEachern to Olympic
sprinter Johnny “Lam” Jones, two
touchdowns by Johnny “Ham”
Jones and ﬁeld goals of 60 and 35
yards by Russell Erxleben to turn
back Texas Tech. Earl Campbell
rushed for 116 yards but had to leave
the game twice when vicious Tech
tackles knocked the wind out of him.

Tony Nathan's 59-yard dash
started Alabama over Mississippi
State, a game which became so
lopsided that Bear Bryant used a
couple of players who weren’t even
listed on the program.

Ohio State came out throwing
against Wisconsin, a uncharacter-

istic move for Woody Hayes, and
Rod Gerald heaved a 79-yard
scoring bomb to Jim Harrell on the
game’s second play.

‘ ‘We thought they were crowding
us,” Woody explained. “They got
their safety into the running game
very quickly. We wanted to show
them we could plass.”

Thomas Lott scored three times
as Oklaoma rushed for 483 yards
and destroyed Kansas State. “The
performance of our offensive team
was the best its’s been all year,”
said Coach Barry Switzer.

Joe Montana passed for a
personal high of 260 yards and
defensive end Ross Browner set a
Notre Dame career record of 295.
tackles as the Flghting Irish sank
Navy. “Our passing attack has
been getting better every week,”
said Coach Dan Devine, “and I
think we now have a very
well-balanced offense.”

Another career mark was set by
Michigan quarterback Rick Leach,
who ﬁred his 23rd, 24th and 25th
touchdown passes-the three scoring
aerials tied a school record-as the
Wolverines defeated Iowa.

Two scoring passes by Derrick
Ramsey, who ran 45 yards for
another score, paced Kentucky over
Virginia Tech. Jimmy Sharpe, the
losing coach, reminded everyone

  sq:  are  19

uthem Cal

Chuck Fusina, who threw 56 yards
to Ed Guthrie and 72 to Scott Fitzkee
for touckdowns. ‘ ‘Our best effort of
the year,” said Coach Joe Paterno.

Elsewhere, Oklahoma STate’s
Terry Miller outrushed Nebraska’s
I.M. Hipp 116 yards to 171 but the
Cornhuskers got 55 yards on the
ground and 68 in the air form Tom
Sorley.

“The reason I got so many yards
running was because of Coach Tom
Osborne,” said quarterback Sorley.
“He reads a defense very well
andheiknew that when they were in
the spread defense their ends
dropped off quite a bit. Plus their
defense was looking for I.M. quite a
bit.”

In the land of upsets:

—Pete Woods passed for two
touchdowns and ran for another to
lead Missouri over Colorado.

— Jorge Portela set a South
eastern Conference record with ﬁve
ﬁeld goals and sophomore Charlie
Trotman passed for 177 yards in his
ﬁrst start as Auburn stunned
Florida.

—And fourth-quarter touch-
downs by Scott Amett, Ric Enis and
Tony D’0razio powered Indiana
past Minnesota just one week after
the Golden Gophers upset No.
l-ranked Michigan.
