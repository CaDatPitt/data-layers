$4,000 Allocation

Special Fund Instituted

The budget of the Union
Board will be increased for
by an allocation of
$4.000 set aside in a special fund
for creative programming by
special-interest groups on the
Oakland campus" of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

The "creative program fund“
is to be made available to
groups from the faculty. staff. or
student body for programs which
would be otherwise stifled due
to lack of funds or recognition.
It is hoped that such a fund will
enable individuals or groups of
individuals to initiate programs
for both the University and the
community. These funds are in-
tended to provide an opportun-
ity for developing innovative
projects which previously would
have perished for lack of fin-
ancial assistance and are not in-
tended to serve as supplemental
funds to support ongoing or ex-
isting programs. projects. or
communications media. or a rec-
ognized campus organization.

The program fund is designed
to meet the needs of special-in-

periences in areas otherwise not
available to the University com-
munity.

The procedure for application
and review of applications for
the "creative_ program fund“
will be established by the Un-
ion Board and approved by the
Union Director. Funds will be
granted upon approval of the
Union Board. Programs of rec-
ognized campus organizations
may not be funded through the
Recognized campus
organizations should seek fund-
ing of projects through the Stu-
dent, Government Allocations
Committee.

The Union Board will sit as a
review committee for these
funds to determine the worthi-

ness of the project and the de-
gree to which the project may
be funded. It is anticipated and
hoped that the monies that are
set aside in this fund will pro-
vide "seed money" for projects.
Groups requesting monies from
this fund may arrange for such
on a grant. loan. or percentage
pay-back basis.

Since the Union serves as a
campus activities center of stu-
dents. faculty. and staff. these
funds will be available to spe-
cial-interest groups desirous of
presenting their interest to the
University community. Through
this approach it is hoped that
the concept of societies of the
University where faculty. stu-
dents. and staff work together
as coworkers and colearners may
be established.

Elections Committee Voids

Last Week’s SG Elections

by BOB BONN
Staff Writer

By unanimous decision. the Stu-
dent Government Elections Com-
mittee (SGEC) declared last
weeks SG ‘selections invalid. The
surprise move. necessitated by
the low voter turnout caused by a
delay in the Registrar's Office.
was made early yesterday morn-
mg.

The first election. held Jan. 23.
was voided after a special Dean of
Students Committee and the SGEC
reviewed several irregularities in
voting procedures which were
pointed out by the United Student
Coalition. the party that lost the
election by a slim 18-vote margin.

According to the official SEGC
statement, “The requirement for
a validated ID and the fact that a
number of students had not been
invoiced was a primary barrier to
voting. Although authorization
from the Office of the Registrar
was sufficient for a student to
vote without a validated ID, this
procedure was poorly publicized.
There, 'on the basis of the close-
ness of the election and the num-
ber of students potentially and ac-
tually denied the right to vote, the
committee feels forced to call a
new election.”

The re-vote will take place this

Wednesday in the SU Ballroom.

from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. All that
is needed to vote will be a blue

Dean Harold Hoelscher of
the School of Engineering
will be speaking with inter-
ested students over lunch in

Room on Tuesday at noon.’
His topic will be the need

be presenting a concert Mon-
day evening at 8 p.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Building in
‘conjunction with the Music
Department. In addition to
performing several religious

F immcial Situation
Necessitates Action

Students. ever thought about
any transferring to other schools
because there was no more Pitt?

There is a very distinct possi-
bility that you just might have
to look for another institute of
higher learning. if by June 30,
the end of the University's cur-
rent fiscal year. the state Leg-
islature has not given Pitt its ap-
propriation.

There is the possibility that
unless within five months the
Legislature has not'acted. the
University of Pittsburgh. Penn
State University. and Temple
University. will just have to
close down.

According to University Vice
Chancellor of Finance. Edison
Montgomery. the University has
had to borrow $20-million so far.
that this sum will increase week-
by-week. and that the interest on
the borrowings is currently run-
ning between $4,000 and $5,000
a day. He also said that it was
conceivable that the banks could
cut off credit "almost without

\ notice." and that in that case
the University would not be able
to meet its payrolls or pay bills.

Reports say that even the to-
tal appropiation. when and if it

comes, will not meet the Uni-
versity's needs or expectations.
Originally. Pitt asked for $38.5
million for the current fiscal
year. but because of an alleged
error in the State Department of
Education the University might
only get $30 million in state aid:
The error; $252 million that Pitt
may not have, that they needed.

Here are the possibilities if

the full required funds are not.

received, and very near in_ the
future. The University will have
to bypass many qualified pro-
fessors and that’s only if they
still want to come to the Uni-
versity knowing full well of its
financial problem; there will be
another tuition increase; many
University programs coming un-
der the heading of “cuttable”-
like the maintenance facilities
will undergo changes; and in-
stead of progressing in any type
of way the University will just
go downhill; or there just might
not even be a University of
Pittsburgh.

It was reported in the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette earlier this
week that a University spokes-
man described University fund-
ing as “approaching a desper-
ate situation.”

Dear Legislator,

faculty members.

CUT THIS LETTER OUT AN DMAIL IT
IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR STATE LEGISLATOR,

I am writing to you to express my concern for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s financial appropriation from the State.

It has been brought to my attention that delay in appro-
priating monies to the University has caused them to borrow
money from banks, resulting in daily interest payments as

I also understand that when the money is appropriated,"
no compensation will be made for these interest payments.

Therefore, every day you delay your appropriation, it is
costing the University money. This affects me in higher tui-.
tion rates and the University’s inability to hire badly needed

Thus. I urge you to do everything in your power to ap-
propriate the monies as quickly as possible.

Thank you,

Linda’s favorite line of report-
ing.

The former Pitt News Editor
described her experience with
the Pitt News as “excellent
preparation” for her current
profession. “More than any-
thing else, the Pitt News pro-
vided me with a sense of respon-

' sibility,” Miss Goldstein assert-

ed. “Having to write three edi-
torials weekly showed me what
it is like to feel liable for what
I write, and, consequently, made
me a more conscientious journa-
list.”

Her work with the newspaper
of a state-related school better
acquainted Linda with the pro-
cedures in which state govern-
ment operates. “I learned to
correlate writing and politics
and found that the two were in-
separable.” Linda reflected.
"It's such a tremendous asset to
what I am doing now."

Linda has been politically ac-
tive ever since high school.
When she was fourteen. she
campaigned -for John Kennedy.
In 1965. she held a political in-
ternship with the Pennsylvania
Democratic State Committee
and served as College Director

Miss Goldstein further com+
mented on opportunities for
women in the field of journalism

“There are more openings today
than ever before, but still it is
easier for men.”

As for her present job. Linda
regards it as very rewarding and
satisfying. "News Room pro-
vides an atmosphere of free-
dom." the reporter remarked.

Contributing Critic

Down below the massive edi-
fice of the Cathedral, in a now
converted gym, some carpenters,
a lighting expert perhaps, and
some very creative and imagina-
tive people have constructed an
impressive little theatre. There is
no stage with structure, it’s flexi-
ble like the structure of theatre it-
self. It can be thrust out almost to
your feet . . . or up high and
far away. A personality exists
there . . . happiness may or may
not be, a war may take place, a
love affair may unfold. So many
things can happen there, so many
new things to learn . . . to be told.

Local theatre in Pittsburgh, for
the most part, isn’t always the
best, but once you’ve worked in
theatre you come to expect to find
this as you move from place to
place. There is, however, at the
University of Pittsburgh quite a
treat in store for anyone with a

dollar, and a free Friday or Sat-
urday night.

It, of course, all depends on how
selective you are, how much of a
chance you want to take, and to
what extent you’ll go to have a
good time. Of course, selectivity
always means a little trust, a lit-
tle interest, and faith. Geared to
train and to entertain, the Under-
ground Theatre is a place where
undergrad students, under the
watchful eye of professional grads
and some expert members of the
Drama“ Staff Experiment with
New Forms, seek out new meth-
ods, and work with a variety of
medias.

The Underground Theate. in
short, can be an exciting experi-
ence! Whether you enjoy musi-
cals, or cowboys, or even belly
dancers at Jo’s Bar, you owe it to
yourself, if only once, to step aside
and try it! There are a lot of stu-
dents who do—and the theatre cer-
tainly will remain as it is . . . but
it is evident that some people
aren’t aware of existance with
such convenience and so little
cost.

Whether the play flops or wins,
it’s worth the buck to get in. I've
never heard of some of them ei-
ther . . . but that’s the fun in it.

What Next?

By JERRY GRUEBEL
Associate Editor

On the local’ political scene
two years ago, Independent
Student Government Presiden-
tial candidate Armand Belly was
convinced of the need to abolish
the Senate. The idea continued
among a certain minority on
campus, and now it's up to new-
ly elected President Harris Mill-
er, who also feels the powerless
Senate should be gone with the
wind.

Miller should have no trouble
at all getting rid of what no-
body wants, but who's going to
get rid of the United States Sen-
ate‘? That’s a different story.

Uncle Sam’s Senate is too god-
»dam powerful. Tuesday, for in-
stance, the Senate approved a
modified “no—knock” statute un-
der which federal agents could
break into a home without warn-
ing or identification if they fear-
ed narcotics were about to be
destroyed inside.

The final vote was 70 to 15 in
favor of the controversial law-
enforcement proposal sponsored

The Real Majority

By RUSS TRUNZO

In discussing individual victims of political
.sepr_ession in this country there are many names
that are seldom heard, because their cases are so
obscure or unpublicized. But these cases often set
the "precedents for how Movement folks are dealt
with later, and how non-Movement folks will be

dealt with when it becomes necessary.

...Lee Otis Johnson is a political prisoner in,

Texas. He was an organizer for SNCC in Austin,
Texas. Early in 1968 Lee Otis spoke’ at a rally in
Austin and said some heavy things about the May-
or._ Afterwards a police undercover agent told Lee
Otis that “that was the last straw.” Two days lat-
er he was arrested, and charged with sale and

it  . possession of marijuana. The evidence - one mari-

i juana cigarette that Lee Otis allegedly passed to
' this same police undercover agent.

..._The circumstances of the trial were rather
unique. Due to the obviously repressive political

‘ nature of the case, William Kunstler (Conspir-

acy) agreed to handle the defense. The trial was
originally scheduled for September 9, 1968, but
with the growing tension surrounding the Demo-
cratic Convention in Chicago. the judge moved
Lee Otis’ trial up to August 26, the start of the

 if Convention. At that time, too, Kunstler was in-

volved in the defense of the Panther 21, and so
Kunstler had to withdraw from Lee Otis’ case.
Johnson was rushed.into the courtroom, he had no
witnesses, no organized defense, and put on trial.

The jury found Lee Otis innocent on the

charge of possession, but guilty on the sale of

marijuana count. This has interesting implica-
_ Can someone sell something that he
doesn’t have in his possession? The only testi-

ll 1, mony against him was the word of a Black un-

dercover policeman.

I  i;iVoice From The Ghetto

The judge sentenced Lee Otis to 30 years in
prison. Thirty years for one marijuana cigarette.
The interesting aspect of this sentence is that in
the state of Texas there is no appeal bond per-
mitted in cases where the sentence exceeds 15
years. So Johnson was immediately hustled off to
prison to begin serving his term while his attor-
nies filed. appeals.

In prison they put Lee Otis in isolation for
the first six months. He was finally let out of
solitary, only after writing an impassioned plea
for release. Even after that efforts were made to
demoralize Lee Otis by: losing his mail; destroy-
ing letters that he wrote to the outside; and put-
ting rumors on the grapevine that his wife was
running around, his friends had abandoned him,
and anything else that would depress him.

At least one of those rumors was true. Many
of Lee Otis’ friends became tired of the struggle
and abandoned him. The Texas State University
SNCC that had been supporting and publicizing
his case has stopped completely.

On November 4, 1969, Lee Otis Johnson’s
appeal of his sentence was turned down, so he’s
begun doing “hard time.” In November Lee Otis
said, “I do feel that if I go to the penitentiary
I won’t come back alive . . I say I’d rather be
dead and free than be a coward and a slave and
alive.”

In that same interview Lee Otis Johnson said,
‘i‘They’ve stepped up their oppressive hand, we
should take five steps to every one step that they
take and realize that they’re in the minority and
we’re in the majority and they know it.”

RIGHT ON,

  Bad Meat at Bad Prices

By RICHARD J. PALAZZI
The problems of the poor are
somehow never simple ones that

When we first moved to Chi-
cago’s near north side, we shop-

Gold Coast and shop at a store
where the prices are not so high,
and the food is fresher. Most of

 

can be solved by a single ans-
wer. Their“ problems are always

S compounded, layer upon layer,

with other problems. And poor
people don’t have to buy a house
to be ‘hurt economically; just a
trip to the grocery can be fatal.

Did you ever wonder where
the unsold meat in your local

 grocery store goes‘? The grocer

certainly can’t keep it too long
or it will spoil. And if he sells
you spoiled meat, you won’t
shop at ‘his store anymore. So,
frequently, rather than throw
away week—old meat (not spoil-
ed, but certainly not fresh), he
will send it to the ghetto branch
of that store, if it is a chain
store, or sell it to a ghetto chain
if it is not. Through all this
handling, of course, the-price is

" jacked up to several cents per
pound more than what we sub-

urbanites would have paid for

I  y it at our own stores.

   

ped at the supermarket in our
own neighborhood, a chain store
about a mile north of our house.
It was a bad experience, to say
the least. The prices were all
high, not just meat prices. The
shelves were often. poorly stock-
ed. The good brand names we
were used to buying at home
were frequently just not car-
ried, and were replaced by
cheap institutional brands at
prices higher than those we had
ever seen. The meat we bought
never, ever lasted a week in our
refrigerator without turning
green, or, at best, smelling like
a ripe garbage can. The weekly
grocery bills often came to forty
dollars. It was plain that this
could not go on. On our $180.00
per month each (gross), we
would either have to change our
middle-class tastes or shop else-
where.

We were lucky. We had a
good car, and could drive up the

 

the ghetto-dwellers do not have
cars, and must shop at the stores
close at hand. And it is unfair

to expect those who do to drive

to another community to shop. I
never had to until I lived in the
ghetto.

I‘d like to close this subject
with an optimistic note. The
federal government is presently
undertaking studies of hunger
and malnutrition in our country.
Let’s hope the solution arrived
at is not a program which gives
the poor more money to pay
the sky-high prices imposed by
the crooked ghetto-makers. If
this happens, the cost of sup-
porting such thieves will come
out of your taxes and mine.

Tell the government you
elected to listen to the cries of
Jesse Jackson and Operation
Breadbasket. who are now point-
ing an accusing finger at the
offending merchants.

by Senator Robert P. Griffin. (R-
Mich.) As amended by Griffin
himself, the statute provides for
such a warrant if it is probable
that the narcotics "will be” des-
troyed or disposed of.

According to the Republican
Senator from Michigan, the
amended bill would“ make it
somewhat more difficult to ob-
tain warrants than under the ori-
ginally proposed Dodd bill
which authorized a judge to is-
sue a warrant for a “no-knock"
raid if he found probable cause
to believe that illicit narcotics
supplies "maybe" destroyed or
disposed of if agents gave no-
tice. ‘

A provoked cry to abolish the
U.S. Senate has nothing to do
with personal or otherwise pro-
tection of a different code of
morals than lived by the men in
Washington. The morality of
drug use is. in other words, not
the question.

The Senate’s action is a ques-
tion.of the freedoms supposedly
given to us in the Bill of Rights.
It seems as if King George’s
fascist redcoats have not left us,
now has. the ugly images of the
Third Reich, Batista, Trujillo,
and the likes.

What the Senate said in pass-
ing the “no-knock” statute was,
“Whenever I feel like coming
in, I’ll cry raid. And you better
let me in or I’ll break the door
down.”

Democrat Sam J. Ervin (NC)
came out looking like some sort
of hippie Senator when he pro-

 

Page
of Opinion

 

The Senate No-Knock

tested that the “no-knock” law
would not mean “using the keys
of the king to open all doors but
usin , the king’s ax to knock
the goor and break the window.”

Next thing the Senate will do
will be to approve a statute al-
lowing a pig to barge in and
sleep with your sister. or wife or
girlfriend, whoever, simply be-
cause he probably “will be” less
horny afterwards.

The consequences whatever
that might entail, could be end-
lessly horrifying. I prefer not
to find them out.

So, maybe it’s time to abolish
the United States Senate, we as
people, before they abolish us.

Liberation Protests
l)ream Girl Concert

(Editor's Note: Pittsburgh

- Women's Liberation was invited

to speak in defense of its oppo-
sition to the Miss University of
Pittsburgh contest last Saturday
night. Because of time limita-
tions, a representative was not
able to attend, so group spokes-
woman Dr. Roberta Salper sub-
mitted this statement to THE
PITT NEWS for publication.)

To millions of Americans Miss
America embodies the highest
virtues and ideals of American
womanhood.

Last Saturday evening in the
Stephen Foster Memorial Chapel,
a young woman was selected to
represent the university to the
annual Miss America contest in
Atlantic City next spring. A
group of women from Pittsburgh
Woinen’s Liberation were also
present, not to compete for the
title of Miss Pitt, but to protest
the University’s participation in
this embarrassing ritual and its
endorsement and propagation of
its dehumanizing image of fem-
ininity. (Wouldn't most men
consider it beneath their dignity
to parade in a bathing suit and
sing and dance as a way to mea-
sure their personal and intellec-
tual value?)

Miss America as the dream
girl of American males is first
and foremost a physical object.
Like a prize-winning heifer at a
livestock fair, she is paraded
across the stage. stared at, eval-
uated, purchased, and ultimate-
ly consumed. This may seem
glamorous in the context of a
“beauty contest," but every
high school girl who has ever

 

litician?

 

walked by a corner drugstore
knows the humiliation, anxiety,
and self-contempt which such
treatment elicits.

A young girl soon learns to
live with and encourage such
treatment, however. She accepts
the fact that her identity and
security derive from her asso-
ciations with men rather than
her own achievements, and she
thinks of herself as a mistress
and helpmate Whose primary
functions are to entertain, to
please, and to serve.

Privately, she works hard at
preserving, embellishing, and
improving her appearance, and
publicly, she is courted as a
consumer or employed as a
salesman for the many indus-
tries that thrive on her image of
passive, dehumanized sexiness.
And, of course, she learns early
that other women are her rivals
and enemies in the great race
for male approval and accept-
ance.

All of these qualities and their
dubious rewards are exemplified

in the Miss Pitt and Miss Amer- J

ica contests. We seriously ques-
tion if this type of pagent is in-
deed the best way to create “in-
telligent, poised young wom-
en.” If so, why not have a simi-
lar event to further the develop-
ment of "intelligent, poised
young men?"

Why is the image of the all-
American ideal woman a phy-
sical beauty who incidentally
can sing or dance instead of say.
a female doctor, female uni-
versity president, or female po-

 

   

°Mother-Earner’
Charges Poor

Representation

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reading the article headlined
"Combat Inequalities” in the Jan.
23 issue of The Pitt News, I am
forced to conclude that the point
of my argument must have‘miss-
ed your reporter. It will certain-
ly have escaped your readers,
since the truncated and out-of-con-
text quotations attributed to me
convey views almost diametrical-
ly opposed to those I offered for
discussion.

I did not argue, as the article
states, that “the actual conflict
(between the roles of mother and
earner) is not as great as it’s said
to be.” Rather, I said that the con-
flict had not seemed as great to
me personally as it does to most
American women, and speculated
that perhaps this difference was
due to the fact that I had grown up
in a particular type of European
family, in which it was taken for
granted that girls would probably
grow up to marry and have chil-

“ dren and at the same time were

expected to fulfill their intellec-
tual potential.

With respect to the question of
raising children in state nurseries,
I stated quite explicitly my feel-
ing that such a “solution” would
be unacceptable to most Ameri-
cans, myself included.

I went on to note that the one
psychologist’s study I have seen

Spurs Vigilance

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a graduate student in the De-
partment of_ French and Italian
Languages and Literatures, it is
my view that the abolition of the
language requirement is the only
hope for the language depart-
ments and for the future of for-
eign language study.

There is a new awareness that
in order to attract students there

 

V TERM PAPERS

must be serious investigation of
new teaching methods. of ap-
proaches and of content, of the in-
formation on human learning now
available, of a greater involve-
ment and responsibility of faculty
in the language teaching process
—n0rmally carried out by grad-
uate assistants.

For the fact is that in order to
staff the many sections filed by
the undergraduate fulfilling the
language requirement the depart-
ments have had to hire part-time
personnel not directly connected
with graduate studies, have had
to use fresh B.A.’s in their first
semester of graduate school and
have had to burden them with a
teaching load of as many as ten

hours a week in classes of up to

20 students while they pursue
their graduate studies and try to
make the admustment to graduate
work.

Many have done a good job in
the classroom; some of these
have failed the demanding com-
prehensive examinations in the
departments because the emotion-
al and intellectual load was too
great. And they are gone now.

But we must build for the fu-
ture. I am impressed with the in-
timations of a new flexibility and
a willingness to examine new ap-
proaches to teaching in the lan-
guage departments. If the faculty
of the FAS votes on Saturday to
keep the language requirement I
am convinced that this momen-
tum will be reduced and will fin
.-ally expire. ’

 Matmen Without Frosh ForLehigh 

by MIKE MILLER

Coach Dave Adams is in the process of drawing up his
forces to combat the powerful and respected matmen from Le-

tomorrow.

I 4 high, who pose an imminent threat to the grapplers 7-1 record

Though the grapplers will be handicaped by the ineligibility
‘of the freshmen, Adams remains optimistic.

“We still have some pretty good
boys in there,” he said.
_ Adams rates Lehigh as being

of the same caliber as Navy. The
wrestlers received their only de-

M 5 . feat at the hands of Navy.

“We’re just going to ‘try to out
wrestle them and hope for the
best,” reports Adams.

_ Adams will fill the first four
positions with Greg Mickinac,
Tom Grant, Dave Wylie and Mark

5 A Payne.

The rest of the line-up is still

is r  undetermined. At 150 Pat Lavery,
I Bud Smeltz, or Bud Morris will

fill the position.

Jim Fleming will wrestle.

Lehigh has a distinguished

class. ‘

A 3 Dick Meyers, senior co-captain,

wrestling at 126, finished fourth
in the Easterns two years ago as
5 a sophomore.

Dave Walters, also at 126, fin-
ished second in the Easterns and
fourth in the Nationals last year.
Either one could fill the position

‘ in Saturday’s match.

Dave Icenhower, who wrestles
at 134, has beaten some good grap-
plers, according to'Adams. He de-
cisioned Joe Boon, an Oklahoma
wrestler who previously defeated
Dale Stahl, Navy’s defending
Eastern champ.

Jay Leeman, at 134 pounds,
maintains a 4-2 record.

At 150, Herb Campbell will
wrestle. Campbell has beaten
Maryland’s star wrestler, Curt
Callahan.

He also snapped the 25 straight
pin record of Ohio State’s Dan
Gable. Gable is a two time winner
in the Nationals and an Ohio State
champion.

Herb Bacastow twice defeated
Bob Kuhn at 158. Kuhn wrestles at

Bentz is a two time Eastern
champion and will wrestle at 167.

At 177, Steve Shields, whom
Adams describes as “strong” will
wrestle for Lehigh.

Gary Leinberger, a heavy-
weight who tied with Ralph Cind-
rich in last year’s dual meet, will
also be on the roster.

They defeated them two years

 Kent Scott Scores 29 Points,
 Get Cagers’ Winning Basket

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Kent Scott’s 29th point with

  134 seconds left was the decid-

ing basket in the Panthers’

, down-to-the-wire 74-71 win over

6 Westminster Wednesday night at
the Field House. But the Jungle

 . Cat fans can thank Cleve Edwards

- for getting off the bench after the

  Titans called a time outto plan

their action after Scott’s layup.

7 7 9 . Edwards was on the court dur-

I i :. ing the entire seeondhalf of the

flgame and scored 13 points and

CLEVELAND EDWARDS
Winning Steal

added five assists. Then coach
Buzz Ridl sent Bill Downes, a ball

hawk to the scorer’s table to re- ‘

port intmthe line-up during the
time out, and Edwards, who us-
ually trades seats on the bench
with Downes, sat down expecting
to watch the‘ final .34 seconds from
that vantage.

“You’re still in, Cleve,” Ridl
yelled to the ex-Robert Morris
star, and Scott, who’s layup put
the Cats to the advantage, sat
down.

The cagers defensed the Titans
stiffly during most of the time re-
maining. Then, with eight seconds
left, Edwards came up with the
steal near the foul line that saved
the game.

Edwards was fouled as he drove
down court and added one more
point to the eager lead.

"Downes is a pretty_ good ball-
handler,” Ridl said, explaining his
move. “We would have brought
Scott back in if they would hav
scored.” “

Ridl was surprised with the per-
formance of his former team.

“I was really surprised at their
shooting in the second half,” he
said. Their outside shooting was
fantastic.”

The leading scorer for the Ti-
tans was Gary Brown with 18
points. He not only hit from the
outside, but also worked his way

HiR0d, Geoff Pro Picks

Two Panther football players

’ were drafted by professional

Vteams in the grid draft Wednes-

day. And both of them will be go-
ing to teams in the newly organ-
ized American Conference.

Geoff Brown, linebacker, was
selected by the Cleveland Browns
of the American Conference’s
Central Division in the ninth
round. That’s the same division
that the Pittsburgh Steelers have

 ,s.ni_ited,into. ,

 

also conducted their draft re-
: cehtly.» j 1 e » ”’

Brown will be seeing a bit of a
teammate if they both make the
grade in the pros. Rod Fedorchak
was chosen by the American Con-
ference’s Western Division kings,
the Kansas City Chiefs. The
Chiefs, of course, are champions
of all of football after their recent
upset of the Minnesota Vikings.

The draft ended a period of
wonder for many athletes at Pitt
as the basball’s Major Leagues

under the hoop for some impor-
tantlayups.

Ridl recruited Brown for the Ti-
tans when he was the Westminster
head coach and said that the guard
“gets under there like that; he al-
ways has.”

Scott Greenwood ‘connected for
16 points; Randy Huey tallied 14,
and Tim Gribbin hit for 11 as they
handled most of the chores for the
Titans.

Mike Paul was the only other
player in double figures, grabbing
11 points for the Panthers.

The way the Titans were hitting
in the second half they might have
pulled away from the Cats if it
weren’t for a strong rebounding
effort on the part of Mike Patcher
and Paul O’Gorek.

Patcher grabbed 17 rebounds
and O’Gorek controlled the boards
14 times. Those 31 snatches were
more than the entire Titan squad
could come up with as the Jungle
Cats out-rebounded the Titans, 47-
29. .

The Panthers will have to win
the battles in more than rebound-
ing Saturday night. They’ll be fac-
ing one of the toughest teams on
their schedule this year in the St.
John’s Redmen.

The Redmen we_re in the na-
tion’s top 20 last week before they
hit a drought in the scoring col-
umn. Their current mark is 10-5,
and they will be coming off an up-
set loss to Providence, 58-57, in
overtime, Wednesday.

"BUDDY MORRIS
Seeks Fifth Win

Cubs Topple
Undefeated

Westminster

Even though the Cubs dumped
the Little Titans of Westminster,
73-61, Wednesday night, the hoop-
sters might’ve disrupted the com-
posure of even a clergyman.

Coach Tim Grgurich’s club up-
ped an 11 point halftime advantage
of 34-23 to 20 points, 61-41, with
9:47 left in the contest. Within the
next three minutes, Carl Morris
scored the only Cub field goal
while the Titans erupted for eight
points.

The Titans weren’t ready to stop
there, however. Once the West-
minster deficit was cut to 14 tal-
lies, the Titans rallied for four
straight buckets; then the Cubs
led by only a slim six point mar-
gin,63-57.

At that point, it appeared that
the Westminster hot streak‘ had
been watered-down as neither
squad scored for the next few mo-
ments. The Cubs blew their three
subsequent offensive opportuni-
ties as Buzzy Harrison was called
for charging, Andy Phillips trav-
eled, and finally Bill Sulkowski
grabbed a rebound but stepped out
of bounds in the process.

Titan guard Gary Rice then
closed the gap to 63-59 with a
tricky, driving layup. Sulkowski’s
tap-in, and steals by Marvin
Abrams and Andy-Phillips and

Whelari H itrt

their subsequent layups, however,
crushed the last hopes of the vis-
itors.

  Tankers Visit Temple

by JERRY MYERS

After a week of practice and a satisfying victory
over arch-rival Penn State, Coach Bill Grant gath-
ers his forces to take on a strong team of swimmers
from Temple University.

Traveling to Philadelpha tomorrow, the Pan-
thers will have to avenge the 57-45 splashing the
Owls dealt them last year up at Trees Pool. The

meet with Temple was earlier in the season last .

year, occuring before the semester break.

This year the schedule-makers have moved the
Temple meet down to fourth on the list of opponents
and this will end a four meet away stretch that the
mermen have had to contend with at the outset of
this season.

Grant sums up the problem as follows: “Temple
presents us with the same type of meet we had with
Penn State. The whole meet depends on where we
place our strength and where they counter with
there’s.”

Grant is eager to attack Temple, figuring that the
mermen have reached the point he’s been looking
for. From nowon all their performances should fit
in a pretty constant groove. ‘

‘The bigmnews of the week. however. is that ace

. in Temple swimmer Jim Whelanbroke his leg on Wed,-

 

nesday and, needless to say, will not be available
for competition..Grant had this to say about the
Temple star, “Whelan is a real good swimmer. He
swims at least three events and he can swim where-
ver he wants to.” Whelan has plagued the mermen
for two years now, spearheading the Temple at-
tack both in 1968 and 1969. The loss of his services
will no doubt have a great effect on the outcome of
tomorrow’s contest.

Grant, eager to challenge Temple’s strength
added, “We have some flyers and some breast-
strokers that they'll have to contend with.” The
coach seems very willing to match Temple event
for event.

Dave Wessel, who put on one of his most specta-
cular diving performances of his two-year career
last week up at University Park. will be on hand to-
morrow to handle the diving duties. Now that Scott

Banister. Temple's outstanding diver for thelast .

three years has graduated. Wessel should have a
relatively easy time. '

Swimming fans will get an opportunity to see the

mermen in action at Trees Hall next Saturday, Feb. A’

Thinclaols Host 82nd Annual

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Over 200 thinclads repre-
senting nine schools will be on
hand in the Field House tomor-
row as Jim Banner’s trackmen
host the second annual Pittsburgh
Invitational Track Classic.

Action gets underway at 10 a.m.
in the field events and track
trials. Finals in the running events
will be staged after lunch.

Teams from Navy, West Vir-
gina, Kent State, Delaware, Ohio
University, Bowling Green, Cleve-
land State and Slippery Rock will
be competing for individual hon-
ors in the classic, as there is no
official team championship. But

in last year’s’meet, the host team
walked off with seven firsts and
five seconds to dominate the ac-
tion and the thinclads will be out
to repeat that performance to-
morrow.

Banner plans to enter two men
in each of the 14 events and he’ll
be more interested in individual
performances than in team totals.
Several new events will be run to-
morrow, including the distance
medley relay and the quarter mile
run. The classic will also feature
competition in the 35 pound weight
throw.

Top individual threats in the
meet include Kent State’s two out-
standing distance runners Ed Nor-

ris and Mike Dawson, Ohio U’s
Monty Irwin and Navy’s Monty
Felax in the 1000 yard run and
West Virginia’s John Reeves in
the sprints and 440.

Norris has already beaten Jer-
ry Richey in two outings this year.
once in the mile and once in the
two-mile event. Richey will run
the mile tomorrow, but Norris is
still undecided.

“Jerry’s been looking real good
in practice this week,” comment-
ed Banner. “And it’s partly my
fault that he lost to Norris earlier.
We underestimated Norris in the
mile. I think Jerry will do fine
this week. *

Gymnasts Team Meets Year’s

Toughest Opponent--Temple Owls

by PETE NYCHIS

Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnasts, coming off two consecu-
tive wins over West Virginia and Kent State will try to keep on
that winning track. when they host the powerful Temple Owls at
Trees Hall tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m. ’

Neiger regards this team more highly than any of their pre-
vious opponents and expects some tough competition in all

events.

Temple, unlike the gymnasts’
two previous opponents, has no
weaknesses. He said, “The fel-
lows know it’s gonna be a tough
meet but they’re confident we’ll
score our highest and if Temple
runs into trouble we might win.”

Neiger also thinks that winning
has picked up the team’s confi-
dence that they can go out and
beat any team right now. “Win-
ning helps raise theimorale on the
team,” continued Neiger. “It’s
been a long time since we won two

- in a row.'I’ll have to check the rec- '

ords to see when was the last tim;
any of my teams accomplished
this feat.” He added, “It sure
feels good to be winning again.”

Temple will be no pushover for
Neiger’s gymnasts. They have a
strong squad returning from last
year which saw them palce sec-

Jaehind Penn State.

2 Leading the returnees for Tem-

ple is senior Pete DiFurio. He’

placed second on the side horse
and fourth on the parallel bars in
the Easterns last year.

A big plus for the Owls is the ad-
dition of Jay Long, a transfer from
Navy. In 1967-68 he was the East-
ern champion on the side horse.
Junior Ron Clemmer is also ex-

pected to help in the all-around
competition.

Neiger "expects to reshuffle the
line-up a little based on the gym-
nasts’ performances in the last
meet against Kent State. He said,
“Lilly and Pribis will be the all-
around men for.this meet. We
could also use some additions on
the side horse.

“With Eastern rules being used I
in this meet which allows us to '
use three specialists instead of j
two, as the NCAA permits, I’ll add 5

Bob Rodgers on the side horse.”
Neiger ended by prophesizing

.“three in a row after Saturday.”

Smitty Brown will try to get
back into his winning form in the
600 tomorrow, while Dorel Wat-
ley will switch over to the quar-
ter mile. Dennis Schatzman will
also run in the 440.

The distance medley relay is a
new event in the classic this year
and freshmen Ken Silay and Ted

lan and Ken Balkey in that event
