The event raised $1,350, 
the goal of $1,200. Last year the group
brought in $1,140 for the non—proﬁt or-

' The refugees whom FORGE mainly works

S taﬁ’ Writer
A Pitt refugee advocacy group raised aware-

A _ ness about the plight of refugee camps and reset-

tlement at a beneﬁt concert Thursday night.

The organization, FORGE, is a nationwide
nonproﬁt group for which college sections work
to increase interest in
knowledge of refu-
gees,

FORGE raised
money for school
supplies for local ref-
ugee children by ask-
ing for $3 donations
at Thursday night’s
beneﬁt concert in
Nordy’s Place .,

Pitt students and
FORGE members
gathered to listen to
the musical stylings
of local bands Ban
Alper, Vindell and

Joy Ike.

Arielle Juberg,
a Pitt student and
FORGE member,
said, “It’s important that college students and
everyone becomes more aware about refugees
because refugees’ experiences can be made so
much better if people helped -them.”

licity. .
“So it’s even more important just to make
people realize how many refugee families there
are in Pittsburgh,” she said._

Evangeline Berube, a Pitt sophomore and
FORGE member, said that the group helps
people learn about other cultures

"Through FORGE, college students get the
experience with international relations that they
might not otherwise have,” said Berube.

with are from Somali, Bhutan, Bhurma, Burundi
and Iraq, said Juberg. ‘

“One of our main projectsiis the refugee
resettlement initiative,” said Juberg. “We work
with families individually and teach them English
and help them at their houses with reading their
mail and anything else they might need.”

Jong Ham, co—presi-
dent of FORGE at Pitt,
introduced the concert
by encouraging students
to join FORGE. She
compared it to another
service—learning group
on campus.

“It’s kind of like Keep
It Real, but slightly better,”
she said.

 v In between sets,

" FORGE co—president
Liz Reali talked about the
14 million refugees who
are living in camps and
being resettled around
the world.

“Our mission is to
make people realize that

‘ a refugee is first and fore-

most a person,” she said.
Reali said throughout the world, refugees
are warehoused, which means they are kept in
refugee camps that are like prisons.
‘They aren’t given even the most basic needs

-like food and water.”
Jenna Meredith, a Pitt-junior who attended,

the concert, said she came because of a fiiend’s
recommendation.
“A friend told me about FORGE, and I

p thought it sounded like a good cause and some-

thing I could learn more about”
Nicole Boss, on the other hand, attended

because her best {ﬁend isjong  FORGE’s -
_ co—president, and because she “saw a ﬂyer with '

a‘, cat on it.”

i New cameras could be a

real crime ﬁghter

It’s not uncommon to see

one of the high-tech, egg-

. ‘shaped security cameras hang—_

ing from various buildings while
walking around Pitt’s campus.
Last week, Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl announced that some
Pittsburgh neighborhoods and
the city’s riverfronts will be out-
ﬁtted with similar devices.

Ravenstahlisaid the installa-
tion of these cameras will begin
within months. The cameras are
aimed at deterring crime in trou-
bled neighborhoods, according
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
They’re also intended to prevent
potential terrorist activity.

In addition to the 120 exit-
ing cameras in Downtown Pitts-
burgh, the city wants to put 32
new cameras on bridges plus 20
to 80 more in neighborhoods.
One or two neighborhoods

in each of the city’s six police,

zones are supposed to get cam-
eras this year.

As a precautionary measure,
all these new electronic eyes are
bound to ‘diminish criminal acts.
Keeping an eye on crime is a
24/7 job, and these new camer-
as willcertainly aid the city’s po-
lice department. Police officers
are, after all, limited in their abil-
ity to patrol the streets. There’s
1- simply not enough ofﬁcers to

keep watch everywhere all the
time. But while the police keep
, to their beats, the cameras 
T ' oversee areas where no one’s
standing guard.‘

Surveillance cameras keep-
ing watch could also free up
ofﬁcers, should they need to re-
spond to an _emergency or leave

the area they’re patrolling. In

this way the area or street they
were watching wouldn’t be left
unchecked.

Even if criminals aren’t dis-
suaded by the cameras’ pres-
ence, the added surveillance
will make catching perpetrators
easier. While there isn’t much
hard data available on the cam-
eras’ effectiveness, they’ve prov-
en useful in some cities.

Denver’s new camera sys-
tem, for example, is a success.
In an effort to quickly bolster
security for the Democratic
National Convention last’year,
Denver installed a 60-camera
system. Crime decreased any-
where from 30 to 45 percent in
the areas  the newly estab-
lished cameras, according to a
lieutenant in the Denver police
department.

Of the initial $4.1 million
invested in the venture, the De-
partment of Homeland Security
is" paying $2.59 million toward
cameras that will guard the
city’s ports against terrorism.
Considering its demographics,
Pittsburgh doesn’t seem like the
most likely terrorist target. Yet,
there’s no harm in reinforcing
security and keeping the better-
safe-than-sorry mentality aﬂoat.

Still, the usefulness of these
cameras isn’t limited to large-
scale crimes like terrorist activi-

. ties and homicides. Sure, they’re

to be built with serious crimes in
mind, but these cameras could
be useful when it comes to
catching lesser offenses. If riot-

’ ers, for example, know they’ll be

underwatch, perhaps they’ll be
more inclined to think twice be-
fore getting too out of control.

in its own infrastructure stimulus:
paving a golden express-lane to
heaven.

Catholic.com —— yes, com —'
draws from the Indulgentiarum
Doctrina, the Vatican’s constitution
for indulgence doling, to explain,
“An indulgence is a remission be-
fore God of the temporal punish-
ment due to sins whose guilt has
already been forgiven, which the
faithful Christian who is duly dis-
posed gains under certain deﬁned
conditions through the Church’s

help when, as a minister of re- ‘

demption, she-dispenses and ap-
plies with authority the treasury
of the satisfactions won by Christ
and the saints.” What?

Basically, after you commit a
sin, God gets to smiting. Wayward.

sons can escape or lessen their

earthly punishment through com-
mon practices like confession or

“Hail Mary” recitations. The truly
devout might just skip straight to
self-ﬂagellation. However, none of
these ambitious penances guaran-
tee an open path on the stairway
to heaven. Sinners might still have
to spend time in Purgatory —— so
bring that Bible you’ve always been
meaning to read. '

Enter: indulgences. These are
God’s version of the Willy Wonka

golden ticket. With enough pre- '

scribed deeds, like donations and
pilgrimages, Catholics can elude
otherworldly punishment for pec-
cadilloes.

Issuing indulgences never tech-
nically fell out of practice, but it
became so rare that many lifelong
Papists didn’t know about it. Now
the Church is resurrecting the prac-
tice in areas such as Pittsburgh.

Two types of indulgences exist,
partial and plenary. Plenary absolves
the sinner completely, whereas, ac-
cording to the New York Times,
partials only “reduce purgatorial
time by a certain number’ of days
or years.” This is where it gets
complicated. What ratio of sin to
punishment is tolerable? Maybe
treating one’s body like a Vegas
casino, rather than a temple, on a
Saturday night is worth a few days

We need to create a conversion

chart.

First, days in the afterlife do not
seem to equal 24 hours. Geologists
place the Earth at around 4.5 bil-
lion years old, whereas creationists
date the Earth somewhere between
7,000 and 10,000 years old — for
the purposes of this calculation,
we_’ll meet halfway at 8,500 God
years. That means one day on God’s
clock equals 529,412 earthly days.

donations can.cut through some '

well on the world market, though.

"four partial indulgences at no extra

tithe.» Heaven might_ be paved in
gold, but its earthly avatars can’t
just print plenary indulgences. It’s
not like they’re making this stuff
up as they go.

In the Bible, Matthew 7:6 reads, .

“Give not that which is holy. unto
the dogs.” Therefore, officials
must exhibit isacrosanct judgment
in choosing who acquires a get-
out—of-Pu,rgatory—free card. They

cannot promise a shortcut to providence

to dogs. A dog is mindlessly loyal to
its infallible master, blindly follow-
ing the commands it is taught. Dogs
spend their existence in submission,
obediently lying prostrate in their
owner’s presence‘. ' 4
Human judgment marks the

, true contention. That Matthew
chapter begins with the famous
quote, “judge not, that ye be not
judged.”'It’s the oldest line in the
Good Book. However, is judgment

than judgment of the negative?
I’m no man of the cloth, but it
seems judging goes both ways — I
wonder if it can get an indulgence
for that. Nobody should presume
to speak for God on behalf of
punishment, nor reward. A differ-
ence exists between acknowledg-
ing a ‘good deed and presuming
the capability of ‘divine judgment.
Furthermore, if stray lambs seek

true contrition, they 'shouldn’t ex- _

repentance.

' The New York Times explained
that re-emphasizing indulgences
is meant to remind Catholics of
“the Church’s clout in mitigating
the wages of sin.” Only 49 years '
ago, Americans thought the Pope
would control the White. House if
John F. Kennedy was elected. Now,
in an attempt to  member-
ship, Catholicism is auctioning off
V.I.P. passes to show Saint Peter.

mercial that says, “Fly Catholic.
We get you to your cloud quicker.”
While busying itself calling people
heathens, the Catholic hierarchy
got stuck in its own purgatory — a

limbo between modernization and

tradition. Bringing back indulgenc-

es is a true Hail Mary: a long-shot ‘

pass with -the hope of restoring
relevance to a losing team. .

dent ticket sales. And now, ‘after Pitt
football’s first winningseason since
2004, he and Pitt athletics are 
things 

Using Facebook and a new “Stu-
dents Onlyf ’ page on the Pitt Web site,

' Pitt athletics is hoping to reach stu-

dents and fans to make  more
accessible and, more importantly, to

get some increased feedback.

The Facebook team page, “Pitt
Panthers,” allows fans to leave com-
ments, View multimedia from recent
games and reach info on upcoming
games and events. The “Students
Only’ ’ page is similar.

It’s part of a plan to get students
more involvedin the process of Pitt
football — something that helped
bring about changes last season.
Alongside Pitt marketing director

Chris Ferris and director of ticket
' operations Reed Patterson, Pederson
met before last year with groups of _ ‘

Pitt students to find out what they
thought about the environment sur-
rounding Pitt football.

The changes? Pitt’s student shuttle
service from the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, which dropped students off
Downtown in the past, changed its
route and dropped students off closer
to the stadium. New entrances were
also opened, and events like the Great
Tailgate were created.-

Pederson and Ferris ‘ said they
hope the Web sites will give the fans
an opportunity to share their views,
which eventually make the game-day
environment more enjoyable and,
with increased attendance, can give
Pitt an advantage on the ﬁeld.

‘We always want to hear what
the fans have to say,” said Pederson.
“It’s a different  of  from

Strong opponents also

bring fans to Heinz Field

Tickets, page 15

where we park and where we enter. And some-
times people have the tendency to forget about
that.” i

A major change that Pitt hopes will get fans
more involved is the. annual Blue—Gold game,
which Pitt moved to’ Saturday, April 11. Before
the intra-squad scrimmage, Pitt will conduct a
football clinic for children 12 andyounger on
Heinz Field, while fans will also get a chance
to talk with coaches in the club lounge. Events
begin at 12:30 p.m., and the scrimmage will 
at 2 p.m. All are free to the public

It’s the kind of  Pitt wants to do to
help generate new excitement for the upcoming

season and eventually sell out each Pitt home I

game —— a task that requires  about 65,000
seats. Last season, after a revamped marketing

plan, Pitt averaged about 50,000 fans per game,

up 60 percent from. a year before

Pitt’s hope of achieving that goal was an-
swered in a smaller way at the end.of last year,
when it sold out its game against West Virginia,
the ﬁnal home game It was the first sellout since
the Panthers hosted Notre Dame on opening
day of the 2005 season, and Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt said after the game how much the
crowd made a difference

Another key to gainingincreased fan support

is a strong schedule, which is something Pitt 2

anticipates. Pitt plays host to non—conference
opponents Navy and Notre Dame — both
programs that always draw a crowd. Big East
opponents playing at Heinz Field include Cin-
cinnati, Connecticut and South Florida, each
of whichrnade ‘bowl appearances last year. The
seven home games are one more than Pitt had

last year.
Still, nothing helps excite-
ment more than winning.

“Of course, that’s a major part of it,” said
Ferris. “But we’re excited to do what we can do
for the fans, for this opportunity.”

Because of the vast improvements in fan
turnout from the 2007 to the 2008 season,
the marketing plan and ticket prices for 2009
hasn’t changed much from last year. Student

ticket packages are still $25,-down from 3549 V

during the 2007 season. Meanwhile, non—student
ticket holders are seeing a $10 increase for their
season—ticket package, but also get one more
home game, meaning they’re actually paying
less money per ticket.

“\mth the way  have been recently,”
said Pederson, “We "did what we think is fair.”

Pitt opens its season against Youngstown
State on Sept. 5.
