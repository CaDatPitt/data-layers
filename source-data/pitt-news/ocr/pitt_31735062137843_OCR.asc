Fraternity Men Make
Preparations For
Rushing Week

With the start of fraternity rushing
set for Friday morning, October 5,
at 8:30 o’clock, fraternity officers are
whipping into shape their schedule of
smokers, dances, and theater parties.
A change in rushing rules, allowing
an unlimited number of rushing af-
fairs, has enabled those in charge of
rushing to plan a large. number of so-
cial functions for rushees.

Aside from this change, the rules
are the same as last year, with the
rushing season ending 2 o'clock, Sun-
day morning, October 14. At that
time the silence period will begin, and
-gill extend until Thursday, October

N. Robert Seidle, in charge of men’s
fraternity rushing, advises freshmen
to give greatest consideration to the
members of the fraternities by whom
they are rushed, and to act in accord-
ance with the rules in the fraternity
handbook, ‘

YWCA Initiates
Activity Schedule

Association Leaders To Stress
Participation In Projects

 

 

Participation rather than the mere
signing of a card and joining has
been set up as the YWCA approach
to its membership campaign which
will continue from now until October
24, The association leaders want the
women to participate in‘ the various
YVVCA projects; such as, Inquiry
forum, social service. religious wor-
ship services, or in the economic and
political groups. Through experience
gained in these groups, students will
become a part of the particular group,

Undi’-1.‘, —the general heading “Build-
ing .Beliefs” the YWCA has divided
its activities into four-classiﬁcations:
dynamic religion, .pe1‘s'onality, growth,
social change, and wadininistration.

The dynamic religion group includes
formal religious programs and serv-
ices, informal "religious discussions,
retreats, and church relationships;
such as Pitkin and Newman. clubs.

Work with personality growth
means work with recreation groups‘,
freshman women, and the discussion
of faculty-student relationships.

In its work on social change the
YVVCA has planned social service par-
ticipation, international relations and
politics and economic relations, dis-
cussions, and human relations trips.

YVV CA administration includes
ﬁnance, candy and milk counter, pub-
licity, and ofﬁce and library work.

Officers of YVVCA are: Helen Mill-
iron, C35, president; Sally Thomas,
Ed35, vice president; Nona Monks,
Ed36, secretary; Helen Turner, Ed35,
treasurer; Mary Frances Brice, C30,
WSGA representative; and Elsie
Leﬂingwell, Ed35, assistant treasurer.

No Business --
Just Questions

YWCA Candy Stand Attendant
Knows The Answers

“No, I don’t want any candy, but
will you please tell me where that
book ﬁle is?” “No, thank you, I
don't want anything. I just want to
know where Heinz House is.” And
Virginia George, new cashier at the
YWCA candy stand in Alumni hall,
wrings her hands and rends her hair
as, the shekels come in, oh, so slow-
y.

But Miss George is hopeful that
business will be slow just the ﬁrst
few days. When the freshmen have
ﬁnally located all their classes and
the search for new “cute” places to
eat has ended, business will surely
show a decided increase, she says.

A specialty at the stand this year
will be ice cold pop and milk. A
polar box ﬁlled with ice keeps the
bottles at a frigid temperature. No
longer will there be tepid milk to
make customers tu-rn down the cor-
ners of their months.

Social Service Committee
To Have Volunteers’ Tea

The social service committee of
YWCA will be hostess next \’Vednes-
day afternoon at 3 o’clock at Heinz
House to all women interested in do-

iing volunteer work in the settlement

houses.

This work offers students an oppor-
tunity to test their education and so-
cial theories in a laboratory of human
relations. It serves as a practical ap-
plication of the sociological work of-
fered in the curriculum of the Uni-
versity.

Lucy Barranti, Ed35, and Anna
Berry, C35, are co-zhairnien of the so-
cial service committee.

New Co-ed Prom

Twentieth Century Club To Be
Scene Of Dance, Wednesday

 

More changes are being made in
the traditional set-up of the Co-ed
prom, the get-together party which
the V‘Vomen’s Athletic association
stages annually for freshmen, trans-
fer, and upperclass women, This
year it’s the announcement from Mary
Gertrude Herron, Ed35, of the en-

gagement of Steve Stoffan and his or-
chestra to play next Wednesday at
the Twentieth Century club. And in-
asmuch as “this is the ﬁrst time in
years and years” that a men’s orches-
tra has played for this one large, all
woman’s affair, it is a real innova-
tion.

Steve Stoffan gained his popularity
(in the eyes of Pitt students at least)
this summer at the Tuesday afternoon
tea and Friday night dances.

From the program committee comes
enthusiastic reports over the ﬂoor
show which takes place during inter-
mission. There’s to be a musical
quartet and several quadrilles to be
‘danced by students whom Miss Eliza-
beth Rearick, the new physical educa-
tion instructor, is training. Bernice
Simpson, Mary Jo Kunkle, and Louise
Kelly will be the featured solo
dancers performing with the ﬂoor
show. In the role of master of cere-
monies will be Carolyn Hall.

Carrying out all the details of a ma-
jor dance the freshman and transfer
women will receive novelty favors,
but as is the custom, just what they
will be, remains a secret.

Social News Published

News of men's and_women"s
social fraternities will be pub-
lished in the Pitt News each Fri-
day. Publicity chairmen of men’s
fraternities are to get in touch
with Jack Hammerschmidt, and

verse reading, started eight years ago
in England by John Maseﬁeld, has
been brought to the University by the
department of public speaking. An-
nouncement that a course in choral
verse speaking has been inaugurated
was made Monday by Miss Theresa
Kahn, instructor in English.

The effect of the work, according to
Miss Kahn, is to increase the range
and ﬂexibility of the speaking voice

in the readings an appreciation of
poetry and rhythmical prose to be
acquired in no other way. The work
will consist of the reading of classical
poetry, Greek choral works, and non-
* sense verse, by groups of voices rang-
,ing from soprano to bass. Harmonic

talks, they will explain the different

Omega Psi Phi
Gains Highest
Standing

   

The story in Monday's News con-
cerning the listing of fraternities in
quality point averages gave the im-
pression that the 13 groups mentioned
comprised all the social fraternities
on campus. Not only was this im-
pression incorrect, but one of the two
fraternities not mentioned is credited
with having made the highest aver-
age of all fraternities for the year.

Omega Psi Phi, local social frater-
nity, obtained a quality point average
of 1.81, exactly .20 points higher than
that of Sigma Alpha Mu, the group
announced in the News as the scholar-
ship leader. The other social frater-
nity which was not mentioned, Alpha
Phi Delta, rated fourth place in stand-
ing with 1.38, and is preceded only
by Omega Psi -Phi’, SAM, and Pi
Lambda Phi.

Monday's error is attributed to the
fact that the story concerned only
those fraternities maintaining chap-
ter houses, and hence being aﬁiliated
with Interfraternity council.

Incidentally, this is the third year
that Omega Psi Phi had lead all social
fraternities in scholarship, having ac-
complished that last year and also in
1927-28, the second year of its exist-
ence on campus.

Sigma Alpha Mu, as winner of the
Interfraternity council scholarship
race, will be presented the large
plaque awarded each year by coun-
cil. Pi Lambda Phi held the trophy
during the last year_ SAM came up
to the council lead from seventh posi-
tion the previous year,

318 Enter Former
Turner Freshman
History Lecture

 

Sophomore, Junior, Senior Groups
May Balance Total Pitt
Registration

Incomplete freshman registration
totaled 983 yesterday according to
ﬁgures released by John G. Quick,
University registrar. The total coin-
pares favorably with last year’s coir.-
pletefreshman registration of 985.

Almost one-third of the freshman
class, 318, are registered for :H%istory
I. the course which Dr. Ralph E.
Turner,*who was dismissed this July
from the history department, made
popular. This ﬁgure is normal for
the course, according to Dr. John
Geise, assistant professor of history.
Enrollment in the course is optional,
except. to freshmen survey students,
who are required to take it. Another
undergraduate course formerly taught
by Dr, Turner, “History of England,"
registered a decrease, from 40 to 27.

Other ﬁgures in the release given
by Mr, Quick were: sophomores’ to-
tal, 704, compared with 1933-34 ﬁgure
of 834; juniors’ total, 639, the 1933-
34 total, 817; the seniors’ total, 697..
the 1933-34 total, 879; unclassed and
special total, 119, the
339. '

All these ﬁgures are theﬁnal ones
for the first week of registration be-
ing complete at 5 o’clock Saturday
evening‘. Additional late _registra-
tions are expected to carry these ﬁg-
ures to a larger ﬁnal number. Ac-
cording to Mr. Quick the reduced en-
rollments in the upper classes are due
to the small freshman class of last
year, bringing the sophomore total
to a smaller ﬁgure. The reduced en-
rollments in the junior and senior
classes are mainly the result of trans-
fers to the professional and specialized
schools of the University. Registra-
tion results from the Graduate School,
School of Medicine, School of Law
and the Downtown division total 757
at present, but are far from complete.
No registration has taken place ab‘
yet. at the Johnstown or Erie centers
of the University.

pointed by Theresa Kahn, coach, and

To the Freshmen

UCH ll-IIAS BEEN SAID during
the last week about your re-
sponsibilities and opportunities in life
at the University, and much remains
to be said. The advice has been
unanimously directed toward giving
you understanding of the University
and a ﬂying start in your study.
The heavy schedule of orientation

 

-events should not convinve you that

the University will plan your life
here, nor that it will do your thinking
for you. By the middle of the first
week of classes you have learned
something of what University educa-
tion is, and the spoon—feeding of fresh

man week has given place to work as- .

signments that call for your own in-
itiative.

Many things now attract your at-
tention. -Classes ﬁll several hours a
day; activities offer you a different
sort of education and valuable social
advantage; and the remaining time
you ‘spend talking, drinking milk-
shakes, probing the libraries, or rid-
ing street cars. Your ﬁrst concern in
all this is planning your hours of
study. All too soon——in six weeks
jammed with ordinary excitement and
extraordinarily exciting football week-
ends——~you will have first examinations,
when a large group of new students
frequently fall by the probationary
Wayside. What University education
requires of you will be clearer then.

It is not our obligation to be your
upperclass advisers, but we offer you
this ﬁnal spoonful of advice, remem-
bering vaguely a parable about wise

virgins.

 

The Press

The following editorial from the
Boston Transcript emphasizes
the desirability of sound study.
while it fails to convince us that
certain innovations in university
education are not likewise de-
sirable. The Editor.

 

 

On Sugar-Coated Education

As Dartmouth college opened to-
day, President Hopkins drove home a
lesson in educational conservatism
taught by a country Where one might
least expect it—Soviet Russia, Mr.
Hopkins was speaking to his students
of the great clamor recently heard in
America against the disciplinary re-
quirements of our college curricula.
Much criticism has been voiced, he
said, against all those subjects which
call for painstaking study and mastery
of exact factual data. The labor of
learning foreign languages, for exam-
ple_ has been under ﬁre, on the ground
that it is not worth the trouble. The
whole system of giving “marks” or
grades has been attacked, as tending
to put our students under too much
competitive pressure to attain a high
scholastic standard. “The idea is usu-
ally accepted,” said President Hop-
kins, “that except for conservatism
and addiction to established forms on
the part of the colleges, such require-
ments would speedily be abandoned.”

And then, with telling force, he
remarked: “Well, they were aban-
doned in the- most radically experi-
mental project ever undertaken edu-
cationally upon a large scale, when
the Soviet Union set up its system of
universal education and founded this
on the (so called) ‘project’ method.
What was the result? In a resolution
adopted by the central committee of
the Communist party on August 25,
1932, the whole plan was declared in-
effective and undesirable. It did not
give sufficient general knowledge and
failed to teach the essential principles
of speciﬁc subjects. The resolution
prescribed a more thorough study of
individual subjects. more time to be
spent on mathematics, physics and
foreign languages, and the reintroduc-
tion of examinations and the mark-
ing system.”

This complete change of policy is
now being put into effect in the land
of Lenin, and it is high time that edu-
cators here in America should mark
the fact well and be governed in judg-
ment accordingly. The youth of our
nation face great difficulties today,
and college men in particular are hard
put to know how they can use their
higher education to proper advantage.
But in this perplexity, one thing is
certain. Any policy Which tends to
make the years of a man's college life
easier and more pampered is a policy
which can only make him less ﬁt, not
more ﬁt, for the very conditions of
difficulty which he must face in the
economic world of today. As Presi-
dent Hopkins quietly points out, there;
has been a surfeit of argument about
what the colleges should do for their
students, and a dearth of plain empha-
sis upon what these young men should
do for themselves. “Much has been
said about making the absorption of
learning less difficult, the conditions
of college life more comfortable, and
the adverse judgments in regard to
indolence and indifference less exact-

The Pitt News

ing. Little has been said about how
iearning should be made more accu-
rate, or about how mental ﬁber should
be toughened and intellectual forti-
tude developed."

These are the great and enduring
needs of mankind in life’s stuggle.
The possession of such qualities is
plainly the most valuable asset a col-
lege man can have. American col-
leges and their students will do well
to follow the counsel of President
Hopkins, and redouble their emphasis
upon such basic virtues. Surely
America need not go further in edu-
cational experimentalism and radical
abandonment of conservative teachin.-.3
principles than even Soviet Russia
finds it fruitful to go.——Boston Tran-
script.

Football T eam’s
Starting Lineup
Still Undecided

Shedlosky And LaRue Battle For
Right Halfback Position;
Detzel Stars At ‘Tackle

 

 

Only two days remain before the
Pitt football team opens the 1934 sea
son with VVashington and Jefferson
at the Pitt Stadium. As yet the
Panther coaching staff has come to
no conclusion as to the starting line-
up.

At present, the majority of fans are
probably most interested in the ﬁght
for the right halfback position be-
tween Leon Shedlosky and Bob La-
Rue. There is little to choose from
between these two backs, Both are
fast, ﬁne defensive players, and ﬁrst-
class men when it comes to broken-
ﬁeld running. The main test is yet

to come, the test is competition, Shed- _

losky has already proved his ability
under pressure. Last year he threw
a pass to Nicksick in the waning mo-

ments of the Pitt-Nebraska game
to give the Panthers a 6 to 0
victory. Although LaRue has not

cracked any opposing lines, he has
shown enough in the last two‘ weeks

of practice to indicate that he is a
competitive player.

Regardless of the starting lineup
in the Wash-Jeff game, it is hardly
probable that it will remain the same
throughout the season. The men for-
tunate enough to start on the opening
day will have to improve from week
to week to hold their places on the
ﬁrst team.

Munjas at Quarter

Miller Munjas, with his two years
of experience in football competition,
has that advantage over Green and
McClure. As yet Arnold Green has}
not come up to expectations, but one
of these days the 200-pounder is go
ing to step out and the spectators
will see some real quarterbacking.

At right end, Karl (Silent Threat)
Seiftert is putting in a strong bid for
a first team berth. Any let down on
the part of Verne Baxter will ﬁnd
Seiffert playing right end.

Art Detzel is probably one of the
biggest question marks in Dr, Suther-
land's mind. Is Detzel-, now that
he has almost made a varsity berth,
going to rest on his showing so far,
or will he continue his hard work and
keep right on learning in order to
cinch the right tackle position?
Should Detzel decide on the former,
Oleniczak will see plenty of close-
ups on off-tackle slants this season
There is a good possibility that it
will be Detzel in there getting the
closeups if he decides that he hasn’t
reached his peak.

Fullbacks and Centers Galore

Followers of Pitt football know
that in the starting lineup there is a
fullback good enough to make any
team in the country and another
equally as good on the bench. Wein-
stock, it is true, has a great weight
advantage over Weisenbaugh, but
what Weisenbaugh lacks in weight
he makes up in speed. Kliskey‘ and
Shotwell stack up the same Way at
center as do Weinstock and Weisen-
baugh at fullback.. Both are crack
defensive players_ both have plenty
of experience, and are ﬁne passers.

For some reason or other the name
of Hub Randour has all but been
forgotten. The veteran Nicksick set
the Panther football camp upside
down with some high class perform-
ances while playing at left half, which
all but obscured the steady game
played by Randour.

Between now and Saturday at game
time, it is unlikely that Dr. Suther-
land will be at all certain of the Pitt
combination that takes the ﬁeld
against Vvashington and Jefferson.

Presidents to Be Strong

Just what Coach “Hank” Day will
bring down to Pittsburgh to line up
against the Panthers is pretty much
of a conjecture. No less than 10 men
of varsity calibre ﬁnished their grid
careers for Wash-Jeff last Thank..-
giving. Day has a good store of tal-
ent left over. however. and the pros-
pect that Bill King, who ran wild
fullback, will be in
shape to start the game for the Presi-
dents gives every indication that the
Little Washington team will be
strong,

Other starting men whom Panther
fans will likely remember are Don
Holland, Southside quarterback;
Rosso left half; Ercius, left end; and
Burkhart, right tackle. All of these
players caused the Pitt offense and
defense some anxious moments in
last year’s thrilling opener.

Freshman Football Team
Prepares For Campaign

 

Coach “Skip” Gougler’s freshman

football squad boasts of over 50 can-
didates this year. These boys are ex-
pected to uphold the tradition of an
“always-good freshman team,” and
from what has been seen of them this
year, this tradition will not be down-
trodden. The freshmen have been
working out every day at the practice
ﬁeld and are in playing condition.
They should be in top-notch form for
their game with West Virginia fresh-
men, October 5.
A general call for candidates has
been made, and all students interested
should report to the stadium any aft-
ernoon after 3 o'clock.

 

Gems From the Diamond

Several classic cracks came out during the

end. At one point, when a team was smack-

lot. Doc Carlson oﬁered this nifty: “The

Jimmy. They need a rest.”

Another time, when an inﬁelder had drop-
ped the ball after tagging out a runner, Rags
Radsvansky put a stop to the ensuing argu-
ment with an explanation that the ﬁelder
was merely "bouncing the ball after making

Team Lacks
Gridiron

Regrettably, the large group of en-
thused aspirants for the 150-pound
football team may see their chances
of playing on such a team at Pitt
taken away, As yet, no place has
been provided for the team to prac-
tice. Unless this condition can be
remedied the plan is likely to fall
through in its ﬁrst year.

Dr. Sutherland, who has long been
an advocte of such a. team at Pitt,
believes that unless £1 ﬁeld for prac-
tice is provided the plan will have to
be given up. There is barely enough
room on the practice ﬁeld to provide
space for the three squads now using
it for practice. _

The interest on the part of the boys
who have reported to coaches Hogan
and Meredith is enough asurance that
there is a place in Pitt for a 150-
pound football team.

Summer School

A summer school session is always
a little less exciting than the regular
terms, despite such added attractions
as free dances (at Heinz House), mu"
sicales, and lectures. But it has its
high spots.

The faculty makes good use of its
summers. Those that don’t go ﬁsh-
ing, return to the farm, or explore
jungles, review books, or write them.
Up at the U. library Dr. Geise of his-
tory has been slipping in and out with
bundles of tomes on ancient history.
The word escaped that he is writing
a book on it. I hope he d0esn"t‘ ﬁnish
it before I get through the course.
It is bad enough to buy second hand
books.

Before Dr_ Ralph Turner left the
University he returned some 50 books.
This has a double signiﬁcance: he,
too, is working on a new book, and he
is a scholar. There are copies of his
latest book, “James Silk Buckingham,”
available at the library.

Dean Amos——I always want to call
her Deaness Amos because it is more
euphonious—has spent a lot of time
studying periodicals for the summer
lectures she always is called for,
while Miss Anderson has been direct-
ing things socially. The poly sy pro-
fessors have been sifting New Deal
pamphlets through their heads most
of the summer, so we’ll have to be
patient with them at ﬁrst, this year.

But Most of the Work . .

UT THE BULK of summer work
is done by teachers working on
their degrees. By coming for two or
three summers and writing a thesis,
out-of-town teachers can earn a neat
M. A, They often do this under ter-
riﬁc handicaps, as in one case .a
teacher from Butler was ﬁnishing here
while revamping three courses of

study _for her own precinct. -

Getting a Ph.D. is even harder. It
usually takes years to work, off
enough credits, and then a disserta-
tion. is required as well_ By way of
elucidation, I might say that an M. A.__
requires a thesis, which-though de-
manding research is usually small and
in a limited ﬁeld. A suggested cur-
riculum, a study of the work of some

 

literature, or some student appraisal
work may be perfectly acceptable.
These have to be digested into min-
ute detail, and the candidate must be
a specialist in his own project. He
must know a large bibliography and
the views of all autho-rities in his
ﬁeld. Pretty stiff, yet in a relatively
small field.

But the Ph.D. dissertation is all of
this plus the fact that it must be an
original contribution to knowledge.
This eliminates duplication and com-

Arthur Atkinson (School of Educa-
tion) is scanning the dissertations of
Ohio State, Columbia, Harvard, Yale,
Pennsylvania, Chicago, George Pea-
body, as well as Pitt's, looking for all
the methods of research used. This
means he must travel to all those
schools and handle thousands of the

dissertations_ So you know a Ph.D.
after a name means something:
authority!

The easiest way to a degree is to be
a high school principal and manage
to send several of your scholars to
some little school that welcomes
every student. The school may re-
ciprocate with a nice fat honorary
that may or may not mean anything.

Anytime you want some dope on
your prof’s degree chase up to the
library and read his thesis, although,
unless the degree was obtained at
Pitt, the library may not have it.
Many of the instructors and graduate
assistants are taking an opportunity
now to run up their own personal
alphabet.

CAME TO KNOW several summer

school students this summer and
pressed them concerning their views
of the Cathedral. One unbetrothed
aged female instructor clasped her
hands and murmured ecstatically, “Oh
it is too beautiful!” But the univer-
sal opinion was that itwas‘ beautiful
but dumb. ‘They whom I asked
claimed it. to be impractical, .unne-
cessary, and the elevator service too
poor, (Sounded like a grudge to me.)
But when I pushed the discussion a
little farther I found that few_ of them
had ever been in the "Cathedral; none
of them had read any literature about
it, and most of them had but vague
ideas as to why it was actually built.

One enterprising M. A. asked, “If
they had so many millions, why didn't
they move. out of Pittsburgh and get
a place where the campus W0111d be
better? Or why don't they pay more
to their instructors?”

I needed only to mention that if the
University wasn't in Pittsburgh. it
wouldn't be the U. of P., and then they
wouldn’t have all those Illl;-l_llOIlS; and
«wghy-“did he want a different campus?
To get sunburned? But I was
stumped about the instructors.

New Curriculum
For Students

 

While University students are count-
ing their credits and the incoming
freshmen are booking their three
credit classes, the freshmen and up-
perclassmen of Fenn college in Cleve-
land, Ohio, will take part in a new ex-
periment in progressive education,
the “blended curriculum.”

Instead of taking courses separately
in history, sociology and political sci-
ence these students weave their vari-
ous studies together during a three
months’ problem. The study of the
ﬁrst period will focus on the topic,

To age tobacco

. . . many methods have been tried but
nothing has yet been found to equal the
old-fashioned plan . . . packing the to-
bacco in wooden casks and ageing it in
warehouses for not less than two years.

All the tobaccos used in Chesterfield
are aged this way.

It requires a large amount of money,
and miles of storage houses; but it’s
the only way to make a mild, good-
tasting cigarette.
