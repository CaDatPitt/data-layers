The election board will be made up of

men appointed by the senate for the

purpose of conducting the election,

pose in these columns and be handed
to any member of the present board.

All nominations must be signed by an

upper classman . to gain recognition
and a place on the ticket.

An appeal is made to the students
to select men for their fitness and not
for their personal traits. In the past
the elections of the University have
been based too much on this principle

and not enough on quality. Because

. a.man can tell a story. well or ‘is a

good fellow does not prove that he

_ can edit or manage a weekly news-

other activities, a little strenuous, and
if a man seeks election to the paper
solely to observe his name at the head
of the editorial column, he might well
forget the illusion at once.

It requires work to publish a paper
in a college, and for that reason the
students should choose men who are
willing and capable workers.

The newly elected board will take

‘immediate charge of the paper after

the election. The board will be Organ‘
izeid and go to "work at once. i

ml‘ the Year 1910-11 will soonpbe re-

moved to make way for the next act-

in the college world,» the year of
1911-12, and the very fact makes it
lmperative that we look to our duty
‘in the matter of bringing new stu-
dents to Pitt. The wonderful strides
of the institution have brought to its

halls ,a, number of students far in ex-
_ cess of its most ardent admirers. It’

. is gratifying in the extreme to witness
the Prestige of old Uni increases with
illcreditable Speed; we are proud of

lllg with a purpose, and it is winning.

‘PURPOSE OF MIND

oneyis brought face to, face with the
greatest problem ofthe college man-
the future career.’ Many men‘ have

with a uniﬁed intention, but it is ap-
paling tp consider the number of stu-
dents, who annually. go out from the
colleges of the land with an almost
vacant capacity forthe colossal strug-

gles of after life. More and more this

is becoming anage ofdistinct special-
ization, an era when each man ﬁts
into his particular niche and no ‘place
else." The man, who departs from the
institution of learning every spring
should bear in mind this fact. Col-
lege,tra.ining does not imply four
years of fun, with no deﬁnite aim in
view for the remainder of .ones exist-
ence. On the contrary it should be
the mould into which every possible
need of the future is entitled to a
place. A college man has a debt to

pay to his fellows who must get into_

the arena unprepared because he, the

chosen one -has wasted four years in

academic or scientiﬁc training. For
that reason the product of the univer-
sities and colleges should go on with
increased speed when the getaway of
life is reached. The University of
-Pittsburgh will send out in a few
weeks a large class of students ﬁtted
for various walks of service, for them
the opportunity to concentrate, to uni-
fy purposedhas "passed, but for the
Junior, the Sophoinore and
Freshman it is _not too late. It is a
sacred duty that demands the atten-
tion of the serious man, and now is
the appointed hour, the chosen mo-
ment to decide. V A A

HAZING AND THE COLLEGE

The.news dispatches‘ of the last
week contained an account of a b_rutal
hazing at Bucknell University. The
victim was subjecteddto physical and
mental agony to such an extent that
his ‘injuries for a time thought to be
of a fatal nature. This latest out-
break of college barbarism, for such
it is, occasions no surprise from the
well informed men of educational in-
stitutions. It is the reoccurrence of
the animal passion which in the ages
past hasbeen attributed to the can-
nlbals of the islands ofithe sea. -There
is a striking analogy between the sav-
age who goes about without clothes,
a huge war club in his hand ready to
annihilate at a-moment’s notice, and
the sleek, overdressed youth, who cov-
ers up the same instinct under the
guise of higher education. The day of
the hazer has passed away, like. all
the forms of antiquated usage. It is
nowdof use only to the fond grand-
fathers who sit about a roaring ﬁre
on a winter’s night and relate the
thrilling experiences of a college
Freshman in the good old days. The
event of the last week is an unfortu-
nate one for Bucknell, an institution
of proud and noble traditions; the
perpetratorsof the outrage suffer lit-
tle by the outrage, but their Alma
Mater must bear the brunt of the
stigma and disgrace. The University
of Pittsburgh can point with pride to
the fact that hazing has not,f011nd ya
haven" among its students. Pitt stu-
dents have long ago discovered that
college men are not in the same class
with cannibals and regulate their

their sports accordingly. .G_enera11y

colleges all over the land are extermi-

will not be long before the practice of
such‘ will rebound unfavorably to fac-
ulty and students alike.

A POOR EXCUSE
A western institution of learning is
responsible for the statement that co-
education was responsible for the fail-

ure of the college to win athletic‘

championships. Of all the lamentable
and weak excuses, it has been our
privilege to notice, this one is enti-
When real, living
students attribute the failure of ath-
letics to co-education, then something
must, be wrong with the men of the
school. The situation is extremely
to ludicrous to note. Many slurs have
been heaped upon co-education, but
this latest offering is unique, -if noth-
ing else. We suggest that the men of
the_,school take long walks in the
evenings and think themselves over.
Higher training will suffer a terrible
blow if these gallants allow the pres-
ence of the gentler sex to disrupt
their athletic prowess. The men of
the western colleges need vigorous
practice and a spirit of hustle. ‘It is
not‘ the fault of co-education—it is
perfectly harmless and a/ wonderful
aid of Dan Cupid. The presence of
the women should be an added incen-
tive to achieve greater things for
Alma Mater.

April is livingup to the standards
of a non-prohibition city.

PRACTICAL EDUCATION i

The manner‘ in which leading local
industrial concerns co-operate with the
engineering school ofthe University
of -Pittsburgh for the purpose of pro-
viding the most practical instruction
possible for its students is declared
toube, without . a parallel elsewhere _,in

this country. It is said that one would
have to go to Germany to witness an
equally effective working out of the

admirable idea. Certainly no other

industrial center ‘offers such’ advan-
tages to would-be engineers -to secure
this preliminary valuable experience
at ﬁrst hand.

A desription of the plan, which ap-
pears elswhere in this issue,-.is“‘w‘orth
a careful perusal by those persons
who question the value of having an
institution like the University of Pitts-
burgh located within its bounds. -It
all depends upon the kind of educa-
tion that the university can furnish.
In a distinctly; industrial city like
Pittsburgh there.,_is naturally a de-
mand for courses that . shall train
young men to superintend technical
manufacturing processes and to’ orig-
inate ideas for greater economy and
efficiency ofoperation. This demand
the university and. its neighboring in_-
stitution, the Carnegie Technical
Schools, are meetingfin a manner that
should eevntually attract many more
students, from -far and near, to our
city. Pittsburgh is destined to be one
of the few great educationalcenters
of the country. For students of the
many branches ‘of’ engi-neening the
city itself is already one huge labo-
ratory.

One hundred and eigthy-three of

SPEAKS ON POET BROWNING.

President Lindsay Delivers Clever Ap-

Before Students
‘ \

Reverend Henry D. Lindsay, presi-

dent of the Pennsylvania College for
Women delivered an address on "‘The
Practical Value of Browning,” last
Friday morning in the assembly room

of Thaw Hall. The talk was of keen
interest to those interested in the
study of this great thinker. Dr. Lind-
say showed that the poet, was ac'prac-
tical man, who was -largely misunder-
stood my people. Severalpoems were
appropriately quoted to prove the var-
ious points of the lecture. The speak.-
er, himself a deep student of Browning
was especially qualified to interpret
the intricate passages of the gifted

Regular Meeting of Athletic Commit-
tee Held in State Hall

 Finances in Good Shape
I

The regular monthly meeting of the
Athletic Committee was held on Wed-
nesday evening, April 12, at 8.00 p. m.,-
with almost a full turn-out of faculty
and alumni representatives. Several
student representatives were absent,
a fact causing some remark among the
alumni. “Lettters” were granted to the
gfollowing men who had played in at
ileast six "games of the basket ball
schedule: TV. F. Campbell, H. E. Bon-

. ine,-J. J. Bane, D. W. McDowell, H. G.

Farmer, S. E. Calhoun.

The election of W. F. Campbell as
basketball captain for the season of
1911-12 was ratiﬁedunanimously, as
was that of J. C. Mackrell as tennis
manager for the present season.

The graduate managers’ ‘report
showed, the ﬁnances to be in good
shape.

Mr. Hall was instructed to get out
the track program with the advertis-

liciting more. The sentiment in the
committee seemed to coincide with
that of the students, that the ﬁeld (ad-
vertising) should be left to the “Pitt
Weekly” and “The Owl," and such
will probably be the policy in the fu-
ture. '

_The Eligibility Committee met on

the same ‘evening at.7.'30 p. m. and
passed a number of candidates for
track and basketball.
_ In the future it will not be necessary
for the candidates to appear before the
committee in person, buthe should
appear before, the faculty representa-
tive of his ‘department who will rec-
comend him to the committee

New Locations Community

The fraternities of the university
are seeking locations forhouses in
such a way that a"community of stu-

Within the last few weeks two ofthe

on Fifth avenue, near the house occu-

RAIN CAUSES IDLE TEAM-

 

Pitt and Tech Unable to Play Last
Account of Wet
Grounds

Saturday on

 

The game scheduled fonlast Sat-
urday‘ between Pitt _and Tech was
postponed on account of the rain and
snow of. the day. Both teams had
made preparations for a fast game
and the postponement was a distinct
disappointment to both institutions.

Captain Farmer prepared a strong
lineup to met the Carnegie- boys.
Malloy was «scheduled to pitch and
“-Whitey” Stambaqgh was to catch.
Galvin was slated for ﬁrst base with

for the other inﬁeld positions, Mc-
Nary, Quailey, Koenig and Nevergold
were selected for the outﬁeld.

The postponed game will likely be
played at the ﬂrst vacant place in
the schedule of the two teams.

Final Heats in Relay Heats Are Not;
Run Because of Poor Weather

The ﬁnal heat to determine the re-
lay team makeup was scheduled for}
last saturday afternoon, but the in-
clemency of the. day prohibited run-
ning of any nature. The ground was
entirely too wet and heavy. Captain
Bryson, Halferty, Rosenthal, Miller,
Henry and Wooten were entitled to‘
run in the ﬁnals.

Coach. Thompson had expected to
be present to conduct the heats, but
the weather, of course upset the orig-
inal ‘program.

Thirty candidates for Varsity base-
ball have reported to the coach at the
University of Michigan, of which

twelve are former Varsity players.
