Financial burden worsens for Pitt students

Tuition /oi/ee smgoasses rising inﬂation rates

By Stacy Browning

Stajf Writer

(Editors note: "Ibis is tbeﬁrst
part of a two-part series.)

Matt Razvillas came to the
University of Pittsburgh in the
spring of 1990 knowing he’d
be paying his own way
through school. What he didn’t
know was that after three—and-
a-half years, he’d be paying
$866 more per year.

Razvillas "held down three
jobs to pay his increasing
tuition costs, while at the same

per semester so he could grad-
uate early. '

Although he receives grants
and scholarships to help pay
his tuition, Razvillas has also
taken out many loans. He will
graduate this May shouldering
a $14,000 debt.

Many students are facing
similar financial burdens as a
result of tuition rates that rise

Academic years

Much of Pitt's revenue,
including tuition, is funnelled
into construction, mainte-
nance and improvement of
the university’s educational
facilities. O’Connor said he
believes he is enhancing the
students’ learning environ-
ment.

“They are getting a good
education, and hopefully,
they will be getting a better
education as we enhance our
libraries, study areas, domrito
ties and renovate classrooms,"
O’Connor said in a recent
interview.

O’Connor stated that rising
tuition rates correspond to
salary levels. He said that a 1
percent raise in Pitt’s faculty
and staff salaries translates
into a 2 percent raise in
tuition.

Tuition hikes are also a
result of federal mandates that
increase university costs,
according to Ann Dykstra of

above the inﬂation rate.

In the last 10 yerrs, the tuition rate
has doubled. If tuition had risen at
the inﬂation rate, full-time, under-

graduate Pennsylvania students
would be paying S1,314 less per
year.

tion, Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor

maintains that it is still a “smart buy.”

More state

funding if

Tuition Challenge could
bring additional state fund-
ing for college students if
approved by Pennsylvania’s
General Assembly.

Gov. Robert Casey’s
tuition proposal would give
state—related, public institu-
tions like Pitt approximately
$200 for each full-time,
Pennsylvania-resident
undergraduate.

The funding would sup-
plement any state funding
already appropriated to the
institution, according to
Charles Fuget, from the
Pennsylvania Department of
Education.

But as the proposal reads
now, schools that do not
keep tuition hikes down
would not receive the
Challenge money — or an
increase in state funding.

“The plan would be trig-
gered if tuition increase is no
greater than the Consumer
Price Index,” Fuget said.

He said that there is not
an exact date as to when the

Outdoor drinking party turns violent

Byjohn Temple
Asa News Editor

Responding to screams for help
from Mazeroski Field, campus
police oﬂicers arrested a 19-year-old
man in the alleged rape of a juvenile
female last Thursday night

According to police, a dn'nking
session of a group of students ﬁom
a local trade school turned into a
rape scene when one of the

drinkers refused to have sex with
the suspect.

“The victim was socializing with
several men and one of them want-
ed to have sex with her,” Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses said. “She refused but he
forced her.”

Although yells from the park
attracted the officers to the field,
police said that none of the other
drinkers were able to testify as to

what had occurred because the
park was too dark for them to see.

After the woman identiﬁed James
Downing, 19, of Pittsburgh as her
attacker, the officers arrested him in
the park, which is located between
Frick Fine Arts Building and Mervis
Hall.

The victim, who suffered bruises,
was transported to Magee Hospital.

Misawa says conﬂict is
process for change in Africa

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

The word conflict lost all
negative connotations and
was presented as a means
of resolution last night.

The civil conflicts of
Liberia, Rwanda and
Somalia were described as
expressions of incompati-
bility by visiting Assistant
Professor Buba Misawa,
who spoke for the African
Students Organization on
“Conflict Resolution in
Africa."

Sean Lewis, president of
ASO, said he wanted to
show students the African
perspective.

‘''These speakers ‘will
enable students to ques-

tion what the popular

press tells them,” Lewis
said. J
Along with Misawa, ASO

arranged for Saeed Abdi,

who recently worked as an

inte‘-rpreter; for American,

forces in Somalia, to share
his experiences of the con-
flicts.

Misawa questioned why
people would rush to
solve the conflicts of
Somalia or the conflicts of
other African countries
engaged in civil war.

“Westerners think con-
flict has one of three out-
comes — win, lose or
draw. But what they don’t
understand is that Africa’s
outcome of conflict is per-
petual,” Misawa said.

He said conflict does not
have to carry a deviant or
destructive meaning.

“In Africa, conflict is a
process for change,”
Misawa said. “Conflict is a.
mechanism that is neces-
sary for resolution.”

The conflict Misawa
spoke of was the collapse

' of the Somalian govern-

ment in 1990, and since
then, there has not been a

with a personal touch

By Bob Wagner
Staff Writer

Dr. David Pratt doesn’t view
himself as merely a teacher.
Instead, he views himself as an
instrument of learning.

“My View of a teacher is not
some all-knowing god—like figure
that gives the gospel according to
the author of the textbook,” he
said.

“I don’t think a teacher is pri-
marily a person who says ‘If you

leam this, then you will be able to I

do that.’”

Instead, Pratt says a teacher is
primarily responsible for creating
curiosity, for stimulating thinking
and wondering and for question-
ing, just as a parent or a good
friend would.

Pratt is a professor of chemistry
at Pitt and he says that he enjoys

' teaching. He enjoys the challenge
creating curiosity of science in stu-
dents, especially students who are
only taking chemistry classes to

fulﬁll requirements. To Pratt, that

isjwhere the fun of. teaching -~

begins.

urse in

One way to get those students
interested is by trying to relate
topics in the course to students’
everyday experiences.

“I attempt to connect what
seems to be very abstract material
to your own personal experi-
ences, and I try to do that through
a lot of lecture demonstrations,”
he said.

One example would be a bottle
of Coke. It looks like pretty ordi-
nary stuff, but to Pratt it’s an object
of scientific curiosity. Questions

about pH levels, what carbon

dioxide does to it to make it an
acid, and how the body responds
to this acid can be raised.

By using examples like this,
Pratt tries to make the class inter-

« esting and the concepts tangible.

Another way he makes his classes
interesting is from research.

“It certainly helps me do abet-
ter job teaching,” he said. “Being
active in_ reseatrclrmeans that
every day I’m confronted with

_ changes thatl haven’t thought of

before.”

would be measured, but estimated
it will be about 3 to 4 percent.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O'Connor has proposed a 6 per-
cent tuition increase next year,
along with an increase in state
funding.

Fuget, commissioner for post-
secondary and higher education,

said it is not unexpected for

schools to plan budgets to the

extreme.

“You have to start someplace,”
Fuget said. “If you don’t ask for it,
then you’ll never get it.”

The Challenge grant would be
available state—wide for Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
Universities. Eligible Western
Pennsylvania schools include:
California, Fdin—boro, Slippery
Rock, Clarion and Indiana.

Previously O’Connor said that in

some cases the government cannot
fully estimate Pitt’s actual costs.
Fuget agreed.

“We’re not disagreeing with your
chancellor,” he said. “What the
University of Piusburgh might iden-
tify as a need  the government
might realize they don’t have the
resources to meet that need.”

Fuget said that Casey’s plan is
a “means of trying to encourage
institutions to hold the tuition
down, to keep costs down for the
students.

“Part of his plan is to support the
need for students to have a low
level of tuition," Fuget said.

Schools may try to lobby for a
modification of the proposals lan-
guage, Fuget said.

“Its possible the governor’s pro-
posal will take a different form,” he
said. “Historically, the institutions
were able to work out a change in

the language.

“It's the first round.”

Tuition Challenge was used in
Pennsylvania twice, in 1989 and in
1990. Fuget said in both cases there
were ways to modify the “trigger
mechanism” — in this case, the
Consumer Price Index — as the
deciding factor for funding.

A vote on the plan itself will
come no later than July 1, but Fuget
said there are e.fforts to get it
through early.

“It will be very difficult to try and
forecast how [Tuition Challenge]
will turn out,” he said.

‘‘You’re never certain what might
be the final consensus to keep
everybody happy."

If Casey’s plan goes through as is
and if O’Connor keeps Pitt tuition
increases at 6 percent, Fuget said:
“You won’t get the money. On this
deal, it’s either in or out.”

research means I’m almost
forced by its competitive
nature to be up to date on
what’s going on,” he said.
“Being up to date on what’s
going on helps me make
my lectures much more
interesting.”

Research motivates Pratt,
and to him, research and
teaching are not just linked
they are one.

But there is another ele-
ment of teaching that is
important to Pratt —— the
human element. Teaching
isn’t only about creating a
curiosity in a student but is
also about creating a rela-
tionship with the student.
This happens by talking to
students after class or see-
ing students around carn-
pus.

Pratt has students from
his classes coming into his
office to talk to him about
what they are doing in
other classes. One of his
former students, Jamie
Cromer, was in his fresh-
man studies class. Cromer
now is a teaching assistant
for freshman studies and
wants to be placed in Pratfs

rently has a fellowship at

tion ‘letter from Pratt in

Tuition questions

Elected two years ago to ride in on his white horse and deliver Pitt
from the tarnished image left by his predecessor, Chancellor].
Dennis O’Connor is once again being reminded that his job‘ is not an
easy one — if not impossible. '

W'henlO’Connor was chosen president, one of his major responsi-
bilities was to restore the credibility of his office. Needless to say, he
met with some difficulty. Early on he had to swallow some mistakes
that the media and the university community jumped on: elaborate
renovations of both his home and office and posh Caribbean Island
trips were a few of the political faux pas, which O’Connor endured.

As time went on, however, the tense relationship between
O’Connor and the media dissipated, allowing him to get on with his
duties. In large part he has been a friend to the needs of students.
He has responded to the needs of minorities by appointing'Dr.
Nancy Washington assistant to the chancellor on minority affairs,
and he has worked hard to make the campus safer for students who
study and frolic late at night.

But now, O’Connor is once again threatening to create a rift
between himself and members of the university community. His
budget plan (see page one for details) is the latest storm threatening
to envelope the university in a tempestuous sea of controversy.

O’Connor’s budget plan is above the national inﬂation rate which
in itself is no big deal. A ‘recent New Yorla Times poll showed that
tuition increases for most public universities will average around 6
percent this year, and Pitt has hit that benchmark. _ .

Despite the fact that Pitt is no worse off than most comparable
institutions, students and parents don’t really care about national
averages. Tuition fees for students are a matter of self-interest, not of
principle. The issue for students is whether or not these increases
have been well spent, or are students spending more and enjoying
less.

Maybe this fact will embolden Chancellor O’Connor to engage in
less political doublespeak about Pitt’s future and more about the
self-interests that students are concerned about. The media is one
outlet. Sending a copy of his budget plan to every single individual
contributing to the university is another. There are other alterna-
tives. But, whatever the choice, O’Connor owes it to his consumers
to explain himself. Otherwise, Pitt may find itself once again ques-
tioning the integrity of its leadership.

Final exams and stress  

It’s that time of the year again — exam time. Students are drinking
coffee, eating everything in sight and getting stressed. Only this year,
the situation has become a little bit more intense. This past week, four
students hijacked a domestic Indian airline’s Boeing 737 because they
wanted to get their exams pushed back.

The students hijacked the plane, which was traveling from Lucknow,

I -India to the capital of New Delhi. with 59 people on board. After a 90- »

minute debacle the passengers, were able to overpower the hijackers,
who later turned out to be unarmed. The studentsalso demanded extra

funding for their university and an investigation into a corrupt dean.

The students wanted their exams postponed because of the civil
unrest gripping Indian society. Their main concern was the interruption
of their studies following the destruction of the Ayodha Mosque by
Hindu extremists.

While Pitt students may become stressed as exams approach we urge
them to remember: don’t hijack any airplanes or PAT buses.
The pressures from final exams are tremendous but most professors do
remember what it is like to cram for a test or two. If you don’t feel ade-
quately prepared for an exam, talk to your professor. If you feel
stressed, try exercising or needlepoint. Please don’t hijack an airplane.
Although, come to think of it, it would make a great front—page news
story.

and coaches, it is the sports media
who are perhaps the most powerful
of all.

When intelligent, well-schooled
writers or reporters have something
provocative or insightful to say,
thafs ﬁne. But that does not explain
or excuse the complete insensitivity
and lack of compassion that most of
the media continually display
toward human beings. Often lost
amid the grind of sports is the
human element. People play these
games, not robots. Compassion and
understanding are lacking, and that
is an awful realization, especially
when considering the saga of Chris
Webber.

The Michigan sophomore, a
superstar onthe basketball ﬂoor and
an exemplary young man off of it,
has been vilified by the media for
much of the season. They have
painted him to be a cocky, arrogant
punk — a black knight symbolic of

_ everything that is evil on the basket-

ball ﬂoor.

At 6—feet 9-inches and a driseled
245 pounds, Webber is an imposing
ﬁgure — imposing enough to forget
that he is just 20 years old. He
entered the national limelight in the
fall of 1990, when as a high school
senior at Country Day High in sub-
urban Detroit, he was anointed the
top schoolboy player in America. At
Michigan he has met and surpassed
all expectations, leading the “Fab
Five” to the title game in each of his
first two seasons. But that is not
enough for some critics.

Still, he is criticized ——- for his on-
court demeanor and his supposed
bad attitude. See, Webber enjoys
playing basketball and is not afraid
to show it He laughs and grins a lot
on the ﬂoor, hollers when he dunks
and occasionally likes to talk a little
trash. Many members of the media
depict him as a brash, nonchalant

person who has no respect for oth-
ers. . ,
And don’t think this does not
affect the public’s perception of
Webber and his Wolverine team-
mates. When you hear people talk
about Michigan it is usually some-
thing to this effect; “I hate Michigan
 I’rn glad they lost” or “they’re a
bunch of punks  they play gangsta
ball.” Now if they were ﬁve talented
white kids from suburbia, would
Michigan take all the ﬂack it has
received this season as supposed

“underachievers and istreetball play-

I’ve heard Webber called a "dirt-
bag,” a “thug” and a “street hood."
not to mention countless other
moronic expressions, many of them
blatantly racial. In 1995, crude and
ignorant stereotypes abound, ridicu-

A lous misconceptions about black
basketball players are still lingering
like some sickening stench.

It would be a travesty not to point
out that a minority of the media,
most notably the New Yorfe Yimes;
attempted to give Webber and his
teammates a fair shake all season.
But the average person only sees
and reads the waves of negative dit-
icisrn.

The shame of it all is that those
people will never learn about the
person that wears the baggy maize
and blue uniform and black shoes.
They will miss out on his refr‘eslring
candid nature, the soft-spoken,
almost shy honesty and politeness
that he possesses. He is a genuinely
charming 20-year-old with a smile
that could melt the hardest of hearts.
Raised in a religious  by two
loving parents, he is a young man
with the proper focus in his life. And
his crime has been having too much
fun for the masses to handle, enjoy-
ing a game he loves to play — play-
ing it his way.

Who is to say what the proper
way to behave on the basketball
floor is anyway? And more impor-
tantly,.the media should better
channel their eliorts to learn about
the Chris Webber who exists away
from basketball.

Sports and life are endlessly con-
nected; and as a sportswriter you
learn that each is a giant metaphor
connected to the other. A lack of
compassion is one of our society's
glaring deﬁciencies, and the sports
world is indicative of that. Media
misconceptions and fabrications
destroy the integrity of individuals, a
terrible thing to distard The pen is a
mighty instrument, used too often
as a weapon against innocent indi-
viduals like Chris Webber.

O’Connor, citing Clinton’s Energy Bill, said
that if approved it will cost the University of
Pittsburgh close to $750,000. He said tuition
will have to help pay these costs.

In an effort to suppress tuition costs, Gov.
Robert Casey has proposed a Tuition
Challenge program.

This propoml would attempt to limit tuition
hikes to 3 to 4 percent by offering universities

$200 for each of their full-time, undergraduate,
Pennsylvania students.

Pitt is complaining that this discriminates
against schools such as itself, which have large
graduate and professional populations. Pitts
student population consists of half undergrad-
uates and half graduate.

Pitt has reservations about this proposal
because it goes against the university’s per-
ceived role of being not only an educational
institution, but also a research and profession-
al facility.

enrollment is approximately 45 percent higher
than in 1992.

Although these incoming students are prob-
ably not aware of Pitt’s rising tuition costs, they
will be facing heavy ﬁnancial burdens during
their educational journey.

If the tuition hikes continue, students gradu-
ating in 1998 can expect to pay 21 percent
more than when they arrived, or a semesters
tuition of $6,083.

“He’s somebody I'll remain in
touch with for a long time,” Pratt
said. “That’s the sort of thing I’m
talking about.”

Pratt says that this sort of inter-
action provides a better learning
environment and a friendship that
lasts forever. Instead of being an
emotionless, stoic figure handing
out assignments and grades, Pratt
wants to know how his students
are doing and to become more
involved in their lives.

‘‘\What also helps me is to stop

However, the human element
of teaching means a lot to Pratt.
To him, a new class of 200 stu-

“If I can help stimulate some
fraction of them, then they will
stimulate me, keep me updated

What has been the most tal-
ented division in baseball, the
A.L. West has fallen behind its
counterpart in the National
League. Nevertheless, the
division is stocked with
enough talent, especially in
the bullpen, to win the World
Series, Cy Young, MVP and
whatever F.SPY award you
want to throw out.

The Chicago White Sox
are stacked, no doubt about.
With MVP candidate Frank
Thomas as first and future Cy
Young Award winner (bank
on it — 1995) Alex Fernandez
as their second starter, the Sox
are only an empty disabled
list away from capturing the
division. Jack McDowell is a
Cy Young candidate right
now, and Wilson Alvarez will
prove to be a capable third
starter. With Ozzie Guillen
back, the infield is impressive
— Thomas at first, Guillen at
short with Greg Grebeck
(starting over Steve Sax) at
second and all-everything
Robin Ventura at third. The
outfield isn’t as impressive,
although George Bell, Lance
Johnson and Tim Raines do

(though they leave a little to

an admirable job at the plate

be desired with the leather).

After picking up Jose
Canseco right before the trad-
ing deadline, the Texas
Rangers possess the most
offensive depth in the league.
Try Julio Franco DH-ing, Juan
Gone—zalez in left, Rafael
Palmeiro at first and Dean
Palmer at third.

The starting pitching is
extremely tough, with Kevin
Brown coming back after‘ an
incredible 1992 season.

Benji Gil, the 20-year-old
replacement for injured short-
stop Manuel Lee, could sur-
prise a lot of people and stick,
but the team’s chances don’t
ride on his back. Rookie man-
ager Kevin Kennedy inherits a
very talented team, but his
inexperience could prove a
detriment to this club.

The Kansas City Royals
have as many new faces on
the club as the Pittsburgh
Pirates, except these new
faces have All—Star talent now.

Pitcher David Cone was the
biggest free-agent pick-up in
the American League in the
offseason. Cone brings three
strike-out titles back to his
home city of K.C., along with
neophyte double-play‘ ‘combo
Greg Gagne and Jose Lind.

George Brett will be DH-ing

Joyner at first and Kevin

Jefferies. Jose is a cannon arm
in right, with the bat to hit 25-
plus homers now that he’s out
of cavernous St. Louis’ Busch
Stadium.

Behind Cone, Mark
Gubicza and Kevin Appier
highlight a less-than.-stellar
final four.

Underachieving but incredi-
bly talented outfielder Brian
McRae will have to get over
the conﬂicts between himself
and father/manager Hal
McRae. If the two do work
things out and all of the talent
meshes, this could be the
division winner —— next sea-
son.

After a collective offseason
overhaul that could rival the
Pirates’ claim to the most hor-
rible dismantling of a champi-
on, the Oakland Athletics
hope that whatever talent
they have left can pull them
through what could be a hor-
rible season. —

Remaining is first baseman
and Fu Manchu King Mark
McGwire, who hopes to put
up the same monumental
numbers he did last year.

Relays run strong for
Panther women's track

By Matt Groff
Staff‘ Writer

The sprint medley and the 4 x
400 relay team led the Pitt
women’s track team this week-
end as it continued to prepare for
the Penn Relays and Big East
Championships.

Track head coach Steve Lewis
said that competing at the
Dogwood Relays, which was
held at the University of
Tennessee, was a learning expe-
rience for the team.

“We are trying different per-
sonnel combinations and coordi-
nating the mile and half—mile
relays,” Lewis said. “We need to
be prepared for the upcoming
weeks.”

The highest finisher for Pitt
was the 4 x 400 relay team
(Katina Miles, Ronise Crumpler,
Monica Hockaday, Kim Blair)
with a third—place finish.

Crumpler, Blair and Hockaday
joined Tonia Malloy in the sprint
medley relay to take fourth
place, barely missing a Pitt
record with a time of 3:54.25
minutes.

“This is the first time they’ve
run the sprint medley,” Lewis
said. “They ran a great race.”

Crumpler also competed indi-

vidually, taking seventh place in.

the 400-meter event.
In hurdle events, Staci Suggs

placed 10th in the 100 meter and
Ayne Allen finished 20th in the
400 meter.

“Staci Suggs had her best per-
formance,” Lewis said.
“Improvements like Suggs’ are
really contributing to this team
and will be important in our next
couple of meets.”

Suggs and Allen were also
major factors with the 4 x 2()()
relay team (Tanya Mullins, Suggs,
Allen, Renee Pope), which fin-
ished in 11th place, and the 4 x
1()0 relay team (Mullins, Suggs
Allen, Pope), which took 15th.

In the 5,000—meter run,
Carmela Mariani placed 14th and
Melanie Ishman finished 16th.

Lewis said he considers
Dogwood and this week’s
Panther Relays to be a “final
check” on the team’s perfor-
mance before it travels to its
toughest meet of the year, the
Penn Relays. The team will be
aiming for more than first-place,
finishes this weekend.

“Overall improvement is what
we are looking for,” Lewis said.
“I’d also like to see some of our
multi-event people, like Katina
Miles and Najuma Fletcher, quali-
fy for nationals.” ‘

The Panther Relays will be
held at Pitt Stadium this Sunday
against local competition from
Robert Morris, Duquesne and
other local schools.

Pirates’ release of LaVa]liere more senseless than cheap

There were several moves that
Pittsburgh Pirate General Manager
Ted Simmons made in the offsea-
son that raised the collective eye-
brows of the city. Whether it was
watching the best player in the
game walk or trading away the
best defensive second baseman in
the majors, Pittsbtugh took each
move with the proverbial grain of
salt and looked on to the rise of
the “Fab Five” rookies.

‘ But Sundays announcement
that Simmons has released catcher
Mike IaValliere makes absolutely

was forced to watch his champi-
onship team dismantled.

Tom Prince, if you guys havegsi N

not noticed, is hardly a big league
player. His .156 career average is
so laughable that it makes Dave
Valle look like a slugger. He is
adequate behind the dish but
brings absolutely nothing to the
plate. Why he deserves a spot on
a big league roster is a mystery
that Simmons is going to spend a
while explaining.

space on the ros-
ter for an important player.

First of all, IaValliere’s $4.6 mil-
lion, two-year contract is non-
negotiable and non—refundable —
the Bucs, basically, have got to
pay it come hell or high water. If
he clears waivers, and chances are
100 percent that he will, the
Pirates have to eat his contract.
Spanky then goes on the market
for the league’s minimum price of
$109,000.

Secondly, what, besides a spot
for Tom Prince, did the Pirates
gain from this move? Rumors cir-
culate that the move was made
because of IaValliere’s winter
statements of obvious discontent
with the organization when he

Let’s not talk

about clinching anything. lets sit
back for the rest of the season and
relish what we may not see for
years and years, if ever again — a
team so far above the rest of the
pack that, going in, you know a
win will be the final outcome.

Boring? Hardly — the squad is
so incredibly talented and plays
with such immense heart that it is
enjoyably laughable to see them
destroy the once-mighty Rangers
by a comical score of 104 10-4.
Can you imagine a 10-4 win over

seasons?

Never.

right field for a full season in

over in the blockbuster Canseco

Rickey Henderson continues
his whining in left and, if not

GM. Sandy Alderson already
lost Canseco (trade), Carney
Lansford (retirement), Mike
Moore (free agent), Walt Weiss

INVITATION T() NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES

Faculty in the Linguistics Departments American Indian Languages program invite students of Native
American ancestry to explore the languages, and through languages the cultures, of their heritage. We will offer
Directed Study courses to individual students (or small groups), helping students to learn about their ancestor’s
languages. The only restriction is that we must be able to find materials for students to read and work with; but
since most languages of North America and MesoAmerica, and many languages of South America, are either fairly

well documented or members of well—documented language families, we do not anticipate having to turn anyone
away.

Students will work with one of three Linguistics faculty members: Daniel Everett, Terrence Kaufman, or Sarah
Thomason. (We may have to restrict the number of students who enroll in any given term, because we will teach
these special courses in addition to our normal course load.) Each course will begin with a general survey of Native
American language families and their distribution, followed by intensive work with one language or language_
group. The course is available for two or three credits. Students who prefer a course that focuses on a detailed
general survey of the languages of the Americas should enroll instead in our regular course in American Indian
Languages, taught by Professor Kaufman (next offering: Fall l993).

For further information, call the Linguistics Department at 624-5900.

fied his hold on the distinction
of being the best baseball

writer/analyst in the game. Not
only does he know baseball
front to back. Not only can he
relate to everyone from Bobby
Bonilla to Turk Wendell. Not
only does he put together the
most accurate predictions on
television or in print (other
than predicting that the Pirates
would fold after the loss of
Bobby Bonilla), but he also
quotes Jimmy Buffett.

When discussing the Buccos’
financial situation earlier in
Spring Training, he pulled a
quote from one of Jimmy’s best

“The cannons don’t thunder,

The starting pitching is alright,
with Kevin T apani, Scott “Day of

rest of the infield, you see a
sure-handed shortstop in Omar
Visquel, a long tme minor lea-
guer finally getting his shot
(Rich Amaral) at second base
and former Minor League Player
of the Year Tino Martinez at
first. Too young and raw to
make an immediate impact, but
look out for the future.

The rotation, anchored by A.L.
strikeout king Randy Johnson
and free agent signee Chris
Bosio (from Milwaukee), should
keep the team competitive.
First-year manager Lou Piniella
provides discipline to a squad
that has been sadly lacking.

J Piniella may not be the most

popular or level-headed manag-
er in the game, but his abilities
have to be respected. It will take
a few years, but with Griffey
staying in the Kingdome for at
least the next four seasons, the
organization is finally on the
winning track.

The California Angels have
as much rookie talent as the
Pittsburgh Pirates and as much
chance of winning the A.L. West
as the Pirates.

The outfield trio of Tim
Salmon (RF), Chad Curtis (CF)
and Luis Polonia (LF) will defi-
nitely cover a lot of ground.
Whether or not they hit remains
to be seen.

The biggest of the three rook-
ies is first baseman J.T. Snow,
who arrives via the Jim Abbot
deal. Snow will play across from
3B Rene Gonzalez, who has
served time with the Orioles, the
Dodgers and pretty much every
other big league team.

.Gary DiSarcina and Damion
Easley will dorm the double-
play combo that will try to bail
out what was a very talented
starting rotation. With the loss of
Abbot, Mark Langston moves to
the No. 1 spot ahead of Chuck
Finley, Scott Sanderson and
Julio Valera. Joe Grahe is one of
the best up—and—coming closers
in the game and should have a
terrific season.
