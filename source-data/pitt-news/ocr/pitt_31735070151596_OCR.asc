STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Board votes

to support
elimination of
print yearbook

Danielle Fox

Staﬁ’ W riter

With about 600 more responses to its survey
on Panther Prints compared to the numbers
from one week ago, Student Government

Board members felt comfortable represent— A

ing the student voice against its printing.

The Board voted to recommend redistrib-
uting the roughly $41,000 used every year
to produce Panther Prints, the University’s
yearbook, and use a fraction of the funds to
produce an online photo album instead.

SGB members released the results of their
Panther Prints survey in front of eight students
who attended the Board’s Tuesday night meet-
inginNordy’s Place inthe William Pitt Union.
The Board was previously scheduled to release
the results of the survey at last week’s meeting,
but extended the period of the survey to garner
more strident responses.

Based on the results of the survey, the
Board plans to recommend to Kenyon Bonner,
director of student life, and Kathy Humphrey,
vice—provost and clean of students, that the
portion of the Student Activities Fee used to
fund the yearbook go to ﬁmding other student-
oriented events or activities. This would elimi-
nate the organization’s formula—group status.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Slates, independent candidate face off in debate

Danielle Fox
Stqff Writer

A debate pitting Student Government Board

candidates Tuesday evening served not only

as a forum for the sharing of ideas, but also
as a lesson in SGB programming.

During the debate, two candidates, An-

, drew Abboud and Ellie Tsatsos, were asked

. :’*~:a":;-.~'-*g}§:*r,«

how knowledgeable they were about the
Collegiate Readership Program, a program
funded by the Board in which students can
pick up free copies of the New York Times
and USA Today on campus. They were also
asked whether they supported the program.

Though each said they used the program,
both admitted they did not initially recognize

it after moderator Matt Singer told them it
brought free editions ofThe New York Times
and USA Today to Pitt’s campus.

' Tsatsos and Abboud said they were aware
of the program before Singer’s explanation,
but were not familiar with its official name.

DEBATE

A similar problem arose when Abboudwas
asked for his opinion about the current price
of the Student Acﬁvities Fee. Undergraduate
students pay into the more than $2.3 million
Student Activities Fund through an $80 fee
each semester. The fund supports the Board’s
budget and is distributed to student organiza-
tions through SGB’s Allocations Committee.

Abboud said during the debate that he
did not know the current price and could not
comment. After the debate, Abboud said he
did not understand the question and thought
he was supposed to answer speciﬁcally about
the exact price, which Abboud said he had
forgotten during the debate. The candidates
who answered after Abboud expressed their
opinions regarding the fees effectiveness and
whether it should be changed, which Abboud
said he would have felt comfortable comment—
ing on.

“I was the ﬁrst one up there,” said Ab-
boud. “Had I understood, Iwould have liked
to elaborate.”

Abboud, Tsatsos and the six other Board
candidates in attendance sailed through

the rest of the one—hour debate in Nordy’s
Place. Singer, editor in chief for Pitt Political
Review and WPTS news director, and Dave
Uhrmacher, senior editor for Pitt Political
Review, challenged the candidates, who did
not confront one another on issues asthey ad-
dressed the roughly 25 students in attendance.
WPTS Radio and the SGB Elections Committee
hosted the event, whichwas also broadcasted
live on 92.1 FM and streamed online.

Members of the Pitt Gold, Three Rivers .

and Forward slates, as well as independent
candidate Jake Radziwon, ﬁelded questions
on the allocations process, the structure of
SGB, student representation and transpar-
ency in the debate. T ‘

During the event, the moderators asked
the Board candidates about “transparency,”
a word that Singer said is “paraded around
as a buzzwor .” .

Ron Reha, a candidate from Pitt Gold slate,
said he would update the Board’s minutes on
the Board’s website as often as possible.

In a nod to former President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, Reha said he would try to
institute ﬁreside chats to provide the “widest
space for dialogue” between the Board and
the student body.

Sara Klein of Forward slate said SGB needs
to vote publicly on its own budget.

Mike Nites, who is running unopposed
for SGB president and is also a member of

Forward, said after the debate that the Board’s -

budget is privately submitted to the Alloca-
tions Committee.

Nites said the committee usually denies a
portion of the budget, but the Board appeals
the decision to receive the full amount.

Abby Zurschmit, who is running on Three
Rivers slate, said the Board could improve
transparency by involving more students
through the establishment of a liaison sys-
tem between student groups and committees.

Board members already serve as liaisons
to student organizations, but Zurschrnit said
after the debate that adding an additional

"liaison, who would be the committee chair ,

or an appointed individual, would improve
transparency by making the Board and com-

mittees more approachable and more con— '

nected to student organizations.
Moderators also challenged the candi-
dates in asking how they will improve SGB’s

outreachto student groups. Uhrmacher added

that candidates often seek endorsements
from organizations during campaigning, but

the groups’ ‘fplights fall on deaf ears” after the
election is over. »

Rainbow Alliance President Brandon
Benjamin, a member of Forward slate, said
the Board has the reputation of an “Alloca-
tions money machine.” He said the Board
should “expand its communication system”
by utilizing ofﬁce hours to engage the students
it represents face—to—face. He said after the
debate that the Board should become more
familiar with the programs and initiatives of
each group it serves.

“Knowing the nameslof the presidents
of 50 groups that you’re lilaison to is not that
difficult,” he said.

The allocations budgeting_process be-
tween student groups and SGB, Singer said,
sometimes “occurs entirely behind closed
doors.” Moderators asked candidates whether
they would make the deliberations public or
continue them in private.

For Community Outreach Chairwoman
Mona Kazour, whois runningas part ofThree
Rivers,.the allocations process should be pub-
lic, similar to the public meeﬁng.

“It’s a great way to see the thought pro-
cesses,” Kazour said. I

US kills Taliban leader, undermines
Pakistani stability in the process

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

The United States successfully ter-
minated another terrorist by drone
strike last week, as it has done every

. week for the past decade, so this

statement should not surprise you.
However, this wasn’t just any terror-
ist, this just happenedto be the head
honcho of the Pakistani Taliban,
Hakimullah Mehsud.

Upon hearing this news, your
ﬁrst reaction should be one of reas-
surance: “Good riddance, one less
bad guyinthe world for me to worry
about,” you might say.

This is a completely justiﬁable
response because he was indeed
a menace. Mehsud was notorious
for terrorizing the tribal regions
in northwestern Pakistan. He was
blamed for giving permission for
hisfollowers to use suicide bomb-
ings and roadside explosives to kill
American troops and many inno-
cent Pakistani civilians. He used the
fundamentalist statutes of Shariah

law as justiﬁcation for murdering
anyone who did not conform to the
Taliban’s harsh ideology.

But despite this man’s blatant
crimes against humanity, his execu-
tion was notwarranted in the least.
At ﬁrst glance, it might seem that
the United States did the Pakistani
people a favor by taking out a man
who generated so much fear and
pain among them, but in reality,
the consequences of the U.S. inter-
vention could prove detrimental to
Pakistan.

One thing that separated
Mehsud from previous leaders
of the Pakistani Taliban is he was
open to talks with the Pakistani
government -- talks calling for a
cease-ﬁre in the tribal areas where
the Taliban operated. Granted, it’s
hard to associate the Taliban with
peace talks, but Mehsud offered a
unique opportunity to the Pakistani
government and to its people, who
were desperate foranonviolent so-
lution to the terrorism that riddled
their countryfor decades.And given

the factthat 55,000 Pakistanis have
died, it seems this conﬂict showed
no signs of slowing down. Peace
talks appeared to at least be worth
a shot.

But clearly these talks are no
longer possible because Mehsud is
dead and his replacement, the new
leader of the Pakistani Taliban, is
one of the most vocal opponents
of any planto pursue_talks with the
government. So, much to the dis-
may of many Pakistanis, the tribal
regions of northwest Pakistan will
continue as a war zone.

This is primarily because of
the U.S. insistence on playing the
parent in the region. After all, one
can imagine that upon hearing the
news that Pakistan was willing to
talk with the Taliban, the United
Stateswas none too pleased, consid-
ering its stance on negotiatingwith
terrorists. For instance, according
to the Supreme Court decision in
Holder v. Humanitarian Law Proj-

ect, exchanging words with terrorist orga-
nizations’ is on the same level as exchanging
weapons with them, as they are both listed
under “material support,” according to law.
So the United States was not about to sit idly
by and let these talks happen, no matter if
the Pakistani people wanted them to or not.
The popular Pakistani politician Imran
Khan has called this “a deliberate targeting of

November 18. 2018 I The Pitt News | \/\/V\/\/\/.lC)lllFleWS.COlTl

He will organize protests against the U.S.
strike, which killed Mehsud a day before talks
were scheduled.

“The U.S. clearly knew what was going
on, and everyone in Pakistan knew what was
going on,” Khan said, referring to the talks.
“We’d been waitingtwo months for this peace
process to start, and then ﬁnally when every-

one had come to a consensus for peace, [the

U.S.] destroyed the peace process.” ,
_ Stability‘ in the tribalregions is a vital
concern to many Pakistanis, and even if the

ﬁitile, there would have been no harm in try-
ing. In fact, the consequences of the strike
might prove to be much greater than the
consequences of mere talks — that is, if the
talks had produced any consequences at all.

Unfortunately, these consequences will
most likely fall solely on the Pakistani people.
Security across Pakistan is strengthening in
preparation of revengeattacks executed by
the Taliban, which they see as inevitable now.
And peace talks are no longer apossibility as
the Talil§an claims to havebeen deceived by

I am hoping that I’m wrong and that the
killing of Mehsud will help to bring about
stability but this just seems highly doubtﬁil.
Targeting individuals in a group as large as the
Taliban will bring about little advantage and
will most likely bring aboutan excuse for them
to commit attacks based on Vengeance. Yet,
this is of no immediate concern to the United
States, anyway, because it won’t necessarily

nocent Pakistanis will. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Zanna’s big night spurs dominant play

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Talib Zanna didn’t win the men’s basketball
team’s opening tip against Fresno State last
night. Zanna might not win many tip—offs at
all this year because he is 6-foot-9, lean but
not slender, and possibly miscast as a center.

When Cameron Wright stripped the ball on
defense and quickly unspooled a pass down-
court, Zanna was nearby, but so was James
Robinson. Instead of one of the two Panthers
gobbling up the pass for an easy two points
that would have cut their deﬁcit to 13-9, they
looked idly at each other as it scooted out of
bounds below the hoop for a turnover — a
turnover on a.tumover.

Zanna wasn’t the reason the Panthers
trailed in the ﬁrst eight minutes — he and
Wright evenly split the team’s ﬁrst eight points
+ and at the same time, he wasn’t being a
bruising center against a team that looked
prone to size mismatches.

Zanna eventually took control of the game

1 against the Bulldogs, whose tallest player to

see game actionwas 6—foot—9. Zanna stood out
with his 19-point, 10—rebound performance.

“He plays hard,” head coachjamie Dixon
said after the 75-54win. “[He ﬁnished] around
the rim, pivoting and powering up and gatl1er—
ing and going up strong.”

Dixon included a lot of dominant descrip-
tions for a player who is not exactly someone
who will play the game physically by pushing
his weight around and exerting moves against
defenders. Zarma did, however, prove he could
unleash that type of streak on the court.

With about eight minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half, Zanna held the ball near the
paint, but it was jarred out of his hands by
Paul Watson. He wasn’t overrnanned, norwas
he duped into a turnover. Instead, Zanna’s
defender slapped at the ball, which caught
a piece of his wrist as the sound of battered
skin echoed beyond the court.

Zanna seemed to have had enough after
already receiving at least penalty this season
in the form of the one—game suspension. He
stuck his ﬁnger out after the foul, possibly
pointing at the offender, possibly at the official

al
Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor
for recognizing the infraction.

Either way, Zanna was ignited, and the
Panthers followed his intensity. The posses-
sion reset after the foul and resulted in a la-
yup by Michael Young that put Pitt up, 22-15.
The Bulldogs drilled a 3-pointer on the next
possession, but went cold the remainder of
the half.

In the next 2:30, Zarma made one basket
on a jump shot, grabbed a defensive rebound
on the next possession and coughed up an
inconsequential turnover. Zanna made the
miscue inconsequential by his own hustle
when, after Cezar Guerrero forced the steal,
he chased down the play and wrestled down

Zanna finishe M9 poiltsml rlnuﬂdiiifl 7"-‘.54 nlufliulelsid

the defensive board with one arm.

Then Zanna headed the other direction
to join the offensive fast break. Wright pulled
up, appearing poised to hoist a jumper, but
instead, no-look dished to asprinting Zanna,
who softly received the pass in the middle
of the paint and ﬁnished with an easy lay in.

After abrisk, 1:30 breather next to Dixon
on the bench —— and what typical center needs
under two minutes to feel reﬁeshed? —— Zanna
re—entered the action. With under a minute
to go in the half, Zanna corralled a rebound,
and again hustled down the court, scoring the

MEWS BASKETBALL

Panthers

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketball found itselffacing a deﬁcit
for the ﬁrst time this season, as the Fresno
State Bulldogs used a hot start to carry a lead
into the garne’s ﬁrst timeout. From there, the
Panthers’ defense shut the Bulldogs down en
route to a 75-54 Pitt victory.

Fresno State started 3-for-3 from the ﬁeld
and led the Panthers 8-2 early on. But Pitt (2-0)
battled back to tie the game at 13-13 and used
a 22-5 run to end the half and carry a 35-18
lead into halftime.

After Fresno State’s early advantage, head
coachjamie Dixon and his staff switched from
a man-to-man defense to a 2-3 zone. After the
adjustment, Fresno State shot just 4—of-21 in
the rest of the ﬁrst half. _

“In the beginning of the game they came
out very strong,” redshirt junior guard Cam-
eron Wright said. “They were hitting a lot of
shots, and we weren’t getting stops.”

As a result, Pitt scrapped the man—to—
man look and went with the zone to combat
the athleticism of Fresno State’s lineup that
contained four guards because of injuries to
interior players.

“We have a great coaching staff, and they
adjusted,” Dixon said. “The 2-3 zone I guess
really worked for us in our favor, and we stuck
with it.”

Dixon’s move to the zone is one Pitt will ‘

use more frequently this season, not only be-
cause of tlie players at Dixon’s disposal but also
because of the faster and more versatile ACC
competition Pitt will face later this season.
Tuesday, it worked.

“Obviously our zone was good for us,”
Dixon said. “I think we have the personnel
for it, and we’ve got a lot of work to do with
it as well.”

ZAN NA

Panthers’ last basket on a pass from Lamar
Patterson. A  S

Zanna sdbred six points after the wrist
incident, and Pitt ﬁnished on a 13-0 nm.

The Panthers got hot and Zanna got hot,
which led to him frequently receiving the ball
inthe post. He made it easy forhisteammates,
sneaking open under the basket en route to
shooting 8-for—1o on the night.

“It was a fun time where I just needed
the ball, and I needed to score,” Zanna said.
“Dixon said just get the ball inside, so we just
let the bigs get some touches. It was just that
stretch. I had the ball, and then Lamar [Pat-
terson] did a good job passing the ball down
low,James [Robinson] and Cam [Wright] too.-”

Zanna ﬂourished on the glass and offen-

sively, snaring rebounds with one arm while
shielding off defenders with the other. He
turned rebounds into quick offense, ﬁring out-
let passes while being shoved to the ground.

And while ‘Zanna might not be the most
imposing force defensi_vely,»Wright views his
rare athleticism for theposition positively,
especially on defense. '

“I just feel like me, myself and all my team-
mates are very versatile,” Wright said. “We can
play one-on—one defense, we can also play
zone and rebound out of the zone, which is
really important.” , '

Dixon said that Zarma played defensively
well, but the team’s second half could’ve been
better.

“[Fresno State] attacked differently than
they had intheﬁlm and inthe ﬁrst half,” Dixon
said. “You wanna play a perfect 40 minutes,
but it’s hard to do.” V

But Zanna was close to it Tuesday night.

BASKETBALL

his ﬁrst start of the year for Pitt after he was
suspended for the opener and took advantage
of his status as the game’s most-physically

. imposing player. Zanna made 8-of-10 shots

to score 19 points and pulled in a game-high
10 rebounds.

I “He plays hard,” Dixon said. “The ﬁnishing
around the rim: pivoting and powering up and
gathering and going up strong  he didn’t rush
out on the rolls or in the post—feeds. We did a
good job getting the ball inside.”

Next to Zarma’s double—double, freshman

‘ forward Mike Youngwas a force on the glass
with nine rebounds of his own. The two post
players set the tone as Pitt out—rebounded
Fresno State 48-25, which was the goal for
Zanna and the rest of the Panthers.

“Dixon always emphasizes rebounding,
every day in practice,” Zarma said. “I think
we were going to come out and out-rebound
them.” '

Pitt’s performance on the glass came much
to the expectation ofFresno State head coach
Rodney Terry.

“[Pitt is] a program that has really hung
their hat over the year on their defense, on

rebounding,” Terry said. “We knew going in.

those were going to be two big keys to the
ballgame.”

Fresno State shot just 37.3 percent Tuesday
night, due in large part to Pitt’s zone defense,
which Terry said came as a surprise to a team

expecting to face man—to—man defense all
night. The combination of Pitt’s execution,
and the Bulldogs’ lack thereof, led to the Pan-
thers pulling out early. I '

“We didn’t do a great job of executing,”
Terry said. “We settled for some shots as op-
posed to really working the ball, working the
gaps-”

Fresno State executed better to start the
second half by exploiting the open areas of
Pitt’s zone. More than 10 minutes into the
second half, the Bulldogs were winning the
half by a point at 16-15.

“The middle was wide open for us, as they

were in their zone in the ﬁrst half, and we just —

didn’t take advantage of that,” Terry said. “In
the second half, we were really pass faking,
getting the ball to the middle, we hadshots
in the middle on dump downs.”

But the Panthers continued to feed Zanna
the ball and received a solid night of play from
Wright to fend off any attempt at a come-

back, leaving the Petersen Events Center with 4

a 21-point victory. Wright ﬁnished with 13

points, six rebounds and a game—high four
steals.

Wright’s all—around performance was one
he feels mirrors the capabilities of this year’s
Panther team, at least on the defensive end
as shown by the suffocating zone defense.

“I just feel like myselfand all my teammates
are very versatile,” Wright said. “We can play
one—on—one defense, we can also play zone
and rebound out of the zone, which is really
important.” Q
