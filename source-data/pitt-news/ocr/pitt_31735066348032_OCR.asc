missed a selective boycott of local
merchants proposal as “ludicri-
ous.”

Pressure from Oakland residents
last week forced the relocation of a

/'~S,t‘udent Programming concert and
 opened debate on the uses and

misiises of the Student Union
Annex.

SGB member Bruce Keeler had
suggested initiating a boycott of

‘ select businesses in Oakland who

fail tosupport the students in their
fight to reopen the annex for small
programming events.

,‘Keeler clarified his statement

“Aw '

a good alternative, but ﬁrst we
have to talk to the people involv-
ed."

SGB member Paul Hertneky criti-
cized Keeler for proposing the
boycott in the first place. “You
don’t begin serious_ negotiations
with a threat. We want to go in and
negotiate fairly with the two-block
committee but now we- are serious-

 crippled. Keeler’s statement did

not help us at all,” Hertneky said.
The two-block committee referred
to by Hertineky is a committee
within the Oakland Development
lnc. (ODI) which concerns itslef
with the two block area surround-
ing the Student Union Annex.
SGB president Furick also called
for, "serious negotiations" con-
cerning the issue. Furick said he
was attempting to arrange meet-
ings with SGB representatives and
’ ODI and, if possible, City Planning
Director Robert Paternoster.

variance which would allow small
programming events to be held in
the Annex. He said variances of
this type were “a rather common
thing.”

Concerning allegations that large
gatherings at. the Annex are a

Furick said there was a need to
“negotiate gingerly” with ODI.

The Black Action Society (BAS) is
working closely with SGB on the
issue and the two groups plan to
meet soon to formulate deﬁnitive
plans.

BAS chairperson Graylyn Swilley
echoed the sentiments of SGB
calling for honest negotiations.
“We should wait a while before
doing anything drastic, I hope we
can negotiate and come up with
positive results,” Swilley said.

Swilley expressed concern for the
black fraternities and sororities at
Pitt saying they had no other place

to meet other than the Annex. »

Focus on

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

A study commission to examine
the position of the Pitt News in the
university bureacracy--whether it,is
suitable for the newspaper’s needs,
or whether it should be altered, is
being charged by Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs Alfred Moye.

The commitee is being formed at
the suggestion of Pitt News
Editor-in-Chief Scott MacLeod who
hopes to mitigate many of the
pro_blems existing between the Pitt
News and the Student Government
Allocations - Committee.

“The Pitt Newss is an organiza-
tion of Student Government,
especially in terms of our prosperi-
ty. There are problems in expan-
sion or changes that add to the
betterment of the Pitt News.”

MacLeod admitted that because
the Pitt News is an agency of the

Wide Faction Rips Gas Tax

BY BILL HADUCK

A possible 15 to 20 cent per
gallon increase in the federal tax on
gasoline has met general opposi-
tion from economic, transportation,
and gasoline industry and station
ofﬁcials in the Pittsburgh area.

ﬁPresident Ford is expected to

‘°“opose the increase next week as
part of his new anti-inflation,
anti-recession program. The edict
would also be aimed at combatting
the energy crisis by curbing
gasoline consumption. -

of the West Penn American
Automobile Association, (AAA).
“There are a lot of people who go
to work in cars because they have
no other way. Out in suburban
areas there’s no accessible" public
transportation. Even if they form
car pools, they'll still be burdened
unnecessarily.” Stradfield also

we’d ask is that they come up with

“What they’re doing is out-pric-
ing the man. The measures would
force people to use their cars less,
but gasoline sales would drop off so
severely, that it would put a lot of
people out of work.”

Pitt Economics Professor Reuben
Slesinger agreed. “It could put
some smaller gas stations out of
business,” he said, “but I don't
think it'll have any dire effect on
the economy.”

 Furick Seeks Annex Huddle Vets Give CGUNOUS OK  
To Federal Money Bill 

BY KEN GORMLEY

Local Veterans Associations dis-
played cautious approval of the
Congressional bill boosting educa-
tional beneﬁts for veterans, ex-
pected to be passed by the Senate
this week.

Ben Butler, Director of the Veter-
ans Action Center in Pittsburgh,
admitted he was not completely
satisfied with the somewhat con-
servative allocation of $815 million,
but acknowledged the present state
of the economy does necessitate
cutbacks in federal expenditures.

“I can’t say that the bill provides

University , it is forced to operate
under certain restrictions, but
added the present system puts
Student Government in an unfair

’ position of judgment.

“We (the Pitt News) have to ask
for money every year, which means
Student Government tries to decide
what our needs, are. But they’re not
qualified. Newspaper people
should make these judgments,”
said MacLeod.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye sees the study
committee as a chance to clear up
the question of relationship be-
tween the Pitt News and Student
Government. His plans so far call
for a small committee of about five
or six members to examine the
structure of the Pitt News,
comparing it to the structure of

other college newspapers, making ‘
judgments and offering sugges-

tions for improvements of the
paper to the Office of Student
Affairs. Members of the committee
will be representatives of Student
Government, the Pitt News, and

- faculty members with experience in

the media.

“There’s a lack of clarity in terms
of how the Pitt News is being
operated now, and how it should be
operated,” Moye said. “The
committee will ﬁnd out whether
we’ve chosen the best model for
our student newspaper.”

Director of Student Affairs Daniel
Meloro feels the study committee
can provide objective criticism of
the Pitt News. “A lot of people
‘perceive the paper to be different
things,” he said. “This committee
will give us a deﬁnitive analysis of
what it_shou_l_d be.” I

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

:' The First Lady of Pennsylvania,
‘ Mrs. Muriel Shapp, was on the Pitt
"campus Monday afternoon, but
. stopped short of campaigning for

_. her husband, to visit Pitt's Western
 Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and
I the Nationality Rooms of the
 Cathedral of Learning. Shapp said
. she_ was in Pittsburgh because of
‘f_‘my own curiosity about things."
 She did answer a few questions
~ regarding her husband's guberna-
ii torial campaign saying that things
are “apparently holding up very
well." She said that the polls seem
‘to show the Governor ahead. ‘‘In
fact," she added,“Probably if the
“election were held next Tuesday,
U-there would be a landslide victory,
. however I can't say what will
3 happen in the next five weeks.”
Shapp, who is a practicing

  

 

marriage counselor and a family

therapist who has worked with
brain damaged children, seemed
most impressed with some of the
new techniques used with excep-
tional children at Western Psych.
“They don’t seem to be stuck in a
rut," she said.

“Sometimes I feel like a child
rescuer," she said in reference to
her work in Harrisburg. She
believes that many brain-damaged
children are mis-diagnosed.
“Many of them are of superior
ability."

Shapp is responsible for “a
revolutionary technique for teach-
ing spoken language to profoundly
deaf preschool children” that has
been made available for free to

pating such/a bill since March.
She explained three similar pro-
posals were defeated in Congress
during this six-month interim, and
the near-certainty of the presentv
bill's passage comes as a relief.
“Considering that Nixon promis-
ed to veto any increase in veteran
assistance about 8%, the current
20% proposal is a sizeable, much-
needed increase,” Moore said.
However, there were several

moves in Congress to increase the

percentage still higher, which were

children who live in a ﬁfty-mile
radius of Harrisburg. She has also
established a nursery school for
preschoolers with minimal brain
dysfunction.

Shapp also visited the Nationality
Rooms in the Cathedral of
Learning. It was her first visit and
she felt that the faculty and
students were very lucky to have
such “faithful reproductions.”

The state's First Lady stopped to
talk to Chancellor Posvar during
the tour and upon being invited to
attend the Pitt vs. Penn State
football game, she replied that they
would love to come although it
would be hard to decide where to
sit because “we just have to be for
Pennsylvania."

stifled by President Ford’s insist-
ance that such action would be
inflationary. Moore was convinced
that “there are probably other
areas of.-federal spending which
could have been cut back rather
that aid to vets."

Another director of the Veterans
Action Center, Bob Beck, felt that
despite the withholding of ad-
ditional funds due to a troubled
economy,‘the allocation is satis-
factory. 

According to Beck, “Nobody,
even vets, can expect to be given
everything free.

.. -Vice Chancellor of the health areas

has an important role in the
decision making there, and the
Provost really has little authority in
that area{" ‘
Cornefeld added, “The health
professions may be connected to
the Provost by a dotted line on a
chart outlining the bureaucratic
structure of Pitt, but the health
professions are clearly a distinct
area for various reasons.”

was basically opposed to the
proposal.

“It’s not going to get any more
gasoline,” he said, “and that
should be what the country should
be putting its energy into.”

“The only way dealing with oil is

/going to effect the economy is if we
could reduce the price of oil six or
seven dollars a barrel. It'd help the
economy tremendously."

Gulf Oil News Representative
_fj;‘_Sherry Zippay said her\ company
‘ ” believes the proposal is aimed at

the wrong goals.

‘‘It would have a beneﬁcial
effect," she said, “It would
decrease demand, but it doesn’t do
anything to increase domestic
energy supplies, which is a more
desirable goal. The. consumer
would be better served if money
would be channeled into energy
research.” .

A spokesman from Port Authority
Transit (PAT) said the gas tax_
increase would probably lead to
greater PAT ridership, but wasn’t
sure of the implications.

/_ “We’re running at full capacity

I. ' during rush hours,” he said, “We
have every bus and trolley in
service but _we’ve already gotten
eight million new riders this year.”

As far.» as being able to meet the
needs of the added riders the gas
tax would bring, the spokesman

said, “It depends on whether we
can get more buses during rush
hours. We can't go much more
than we're doing now until we get
more buses.” He said PAT would
get 75 new buses next year.

Pennsylvania Association of Gas
Retailers President Dave Haddad
doubted the proposal would ever
become reality.

“I don’t think it’ll ever get
through Congress,” he said,
“There’ll be too much citizen
pressure, and the legislators
themselves won’t want it. No
matter how big the ‘guy is, the tax
will take a hell of a chunk out of his
purse.”

Otherwise, Haddad believed the
tax may be the only- solution.
“People have not curtailed the use
of their automobiles and the
situation is going to get worse‘. A
tax may be the simplest way to
solve the problem.”

Charging that damage in the
recent Honduras hurricane was
worse than the US Embassy ad-
mitted. a representative of a Pitts-
burgh medical assistance organi-
z_ation said Tuesday that. more US
aid’ is needed. _

Honduran health officials have
given figures of an estimated
12,000 people dead and 500,000 left
homeless, contrary to the US

Embassy’s figures of 6-8,000 dead,'

according to Luke Hingson, admin-
istrative assistant of the Brother’s
Brother Foundation.

“The US is not sending in
vaccination teams like in the past,”
said Hingson. “They just do not
have themoney." In addition to the
lack of funds, U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID)
finds it too difficult to coordinate
the many private organizations that
go into a country that has been hit
by a natural disaster, according to
Hingson. —

The Foundation responded to a
call for help from the Honduran
Health Minister by sending direc-
tor Robert Hingson, Luke’s father,
to Honduras with supplies of
vaccine and jet injectors. These
injectors. invented by the older
Hingson, speed the rate of
immunization, greatly reducing the
threat of nationwide epidemics,
Hingson said.

“One of the first problems was to
set up communications,” said
Hingson. “This is difficult because

  

you do not have radio stations in
each town.”

In addition to the aid that has
already been sent, the Foundation
is planning another trip to
Honduras.

“I’m going down with 1,200
injectors and will turn them over to
the Honduran officials,” said
Hingson. “We are sending down
34,000 pounds of food. This was
donated by the Clark Candy

Company and the H. J. Heinz
Company. We are also sending
about 40 tons of sorgum seed.”

faculty Unionization

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  

to determine an appropriate bargaining unit are an initial step in the
unionization process of Pitt faculty members for collective bargaining
purposes. ..

Many signiﬁcant questions with critical ramiﬁcations for the
-University will be raised during this process, which may not be
concluded until next year.

Union spokesmen agree two major issues are involved in the
‘unionization process. They are faculty salaries and tenure or academic
security for faculty members.
_ Pitt union leaders claim the current high rate of inﬂation mandates an
increase in faculty salaries, which could expand the budget of the
University. They also maintain fewer faculty will be promoted and
receive academic tenure as a result of rising costs. This will demand,
according to union spokesmen, that the reasons for tenure denials and
‘promotion rejections be speciﬁed, so that administrators will not be
able to make arbitrary decisions and faculty will be guaranteed due
~ process in tenure cases.
Another issue of signiﬁcance involved in the unionization of Pitt
faculty is the general question of decision making at Pitt. Should
administrators have sole authority in making decisions on issues
concerning the day to day operations of the University, including
tenure decisions and the appointment of department chairmen? And to
"what extent should the faculty participate in the governing process of
the University? I -
But, there are other greater and all encompassing questions to be
, answered. Should faculty members unionize? To what extent will

beneﬁcial to students? And essentially, will unionization of faculty be
a good thing for Pitt? v
Obviously, the ramiﬁcations of these issues associated with the

effects for students could be critical, which requires that students’
views on these issues be voiced. ‘
I  ' Students have a special responsibility to themselves to make sure that
I  their opinion is known to the faculty and administration. Accepting its
responsibility in_..this matter the Pitt News will attempt to put these
issues in perspective for our reading audience in future editorials.
Like the Pitt News, though, the Student government Board, also has a
special responsibility in this area. Board members should acquaint
themselves with the issues involved in the unionization process and
educate themselves of the possible ramiﬁcations and effects for
students. In this way they will be able to express the concerns of
.- _ students at appropriate faculty-administrator-student forums, so as to

 insure that unionization of faculty not be only a question resolved by
faculty and administrators without consideration for legitimate student
concerns.

The Liberal Arts Ideal

BY ROBERT MARSHALL

I think it's rather clear that the
most critical issue facing Liberal
Arts schools these days is whether
or not they can continue to play
their dominant role in higher
education in the face of the growing
concerns among students about
career preparation.

In this and at least three more

articles over the next few weeks, 1
would like to raise the issue,
suggest some causes, outline some
possible new directions. My
purpose is to generate discussion
as widely as possible, partly with
an eye to having the topic on the
agenda of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences‘ Fall and Winter meet-
ings. 1 encourage as many indivi-
duals and groups among the stu-
dent body as are interested to make
their views known to student
representatives, to faculty, and to
the administration.

I would like to stress that I am not
myself necessarily recommending
change simply because I raise the
question of whether or not we
should change. As a matter of fact,
my most natural tendencies are to
want to defend as vigorously as
possible the traditional values of
the Liberal Arts, though I am also
quite prepared for reasons I shall
be explaining to move in some of
the other possible directions. The
important question, though, is
where it is that the faculty and the
students wish to be or to move, and
I believe it is my function as an
administrator to make that explicit
by causing an open and thorough
discussion of the issues.

I don't think we often enough
realize how important it is, through
the process of debate. sometimes
to reaffirm purposes that are still
valid but have become vague. I
cherish the memor_\', which now
seems of times distantly past, of
those heady days five and six and
seven years ago when we were a

campus constantly involved in bit-

Fred Featherston

ter discussions about the purposes
of education.

I think we knew better then what
we were doing, though sometimes
the talking got in the way of the
doing—except that, in that myster-
ious way in which process and
content or the dancer and the dance
cannot be separated, talking was
doing. We forget too easily that
institutions of education (I, don't
know about the United Nations) are
supposed to be glorified debating
societies.

This year’s freshmen were in the
7th grade in 1968, when we were
doing all that talking. We owe
them a willingness as an institution
to debate regularly anew the issues
of why we exist at all, let alone in
-the ways we do, of what our
relevance indeed is to students’
and society’s needs, of why we
ought to get all that money from
the state’s taxpayers and from the
students and their parents.

The issue of the Liberal Arts and
careers is a particularly significant
one here at Pitt because of the
structure of our undergraduate
daytime program. The fact is that
the College of Arts and Sciences is
the overwhelmingly largest under-
graduate school. And the question
is why. ‘I'd like to think that those
9000 students have all very pur-
posefully and self-consciously
chosen a Liberal Arts education.

But l'don't think that’s quite true.

ldon‘t believe we know very much
about. or a least think very much
about. why our students are here——
why they choose to go on to higher
education, why they come to Pitt,
whether it means anything to them
that Pitt is a university rather than
a college (a very important dis-
tinction to some as they argue the
mission of this institution), why
they choose a particular undergra-
duate program.

I assume that there are large

I. numbers of CAS students who are

in the school only because the do
not want to be engineers or

teachers or nurses or social workers
or health-related professionals (the
range of choices in undergraduate
daytime programs.] That can, by
the way, make for a very creative
situation. I believe that the Liberal

Arts ideal plays its richest role
among students who don’t know
what they want. As an English
teacher, I’ve worked largely with
students who were English majors
because they didn’t know what else
to do, and l’ve found them as a
whole more interesting and chal-
lenging than the “professional”
English major headed specifically
for graduate school or teaching.

But, it also can make for very
frustrating circumstances for a
student to be in a school or major
for negative reasons. And the time
has come for us to deal with those
frustrations, either by steps that
would change the focus of under-
graduate education or by a vigor-
ous and aggressive reaffirmation of
the Liberal Arts ideal.

That's the issue I propose for
debate, and I think it should be
clear that we must engage in the
process not only /for educational
reasons, as I have suggested, but

for practical ones. A few years ago K
when we talked about responding ‘L

to students’ and society‘s
demands, we had educational and
ideological reasons. Now we have
practical ones.

lt’s no news that the crunch is
ahead for higher education in this
country, and we are going to have
to get-used to being accountable to

,the people who pay our bills,
taxpayers and students and’‘\_

.3.»

parents. I say again that being
accountable to doesn't mean giving
in to. It may mean change; it may
also mean the willingness and the
energy to make explicit and con-
vineingthe reasons why we believe
what we believe and do what we

' do.

Featherston, who was more than a
little upset over an eviction notice.

The whole thing started when Roy
Mardis, a policeman and neighbor
of Featherston, went to the, old
man’s apartment to complain about
some loud noises coming from
there. Featherston told Mardis to
leave or he would be greeted with a
shotgun blast. Mardis went and
secured the aid of another officer,
and together they approached the
apartment. Featherston kept his
word, as a shotgun blast ripped the
door apart. 1

If the old guy thought he could
avoid eviction before, he must have
realized his landlord wouldn't let
him stay after this. Anyway, the
cavalry was called and when the
dust settled, Featherston was
dead. Three bullets had found his
body during the siege.

In order to see the significance of
this occurrence, it is necessary to
know just what kind of man Fred
Featherston was. He was not a
hardened criminal.

All that changed early last week.
Fred Featherston, along with all
the other tenants in his apartment
building, received’ an eviction
notice. His landlord had decided to
remodel and figured it would be an
easier task if the building was
empty. Everyone had to go.

But, it’s not easy for an old man to
leave his home, even if it happens
to be just a room in an apartment.
So Fred Featherston decided to
challenge the system. He made his
point, but it cost him his life.

\LStuolent Affairs

And Morality

Dear Editor, V
In light of the recent decisions
against the Delta Sigma Chi
fraternity and the present admini-
stration stance on morality and the
evils of alcohol as far as freshman
are concerned there appears to be a
great discrepancy between the
example set by University admini-
- strators and their proposed moral

-4 “standards.

The situation I’m referring to is
this year’s Freshman Fall Week-
end. Administrators threatened
expulsion from camp (i.e., Fresh-
man Fall Weekend) and possible
further disciplinary action for any
freshman caught with alcohol or
drugs at Freshman Fall Camp.
These rules were not unlike those
for Orientation itself.

It seems as though at the same
time these “m7irality” rules were
imposed for freshman, the admini-
strators of the University appar-
ently subscribe to different stand-

frards. At that dry Freshman Fall
Weekend members of the staff of
the Office of Student Affairs
including a very high-placed
University official came to Fresh-
man Fall Weekend with an 80 proof
cache and soon found themselves,
in plain and simple terms, drunk to
the gills. Undoubtedly, a fine
example to offer freshman whose

Kigkimpressionable mind could not

 ’ tolerate drinking beer at orienta-

tion parties.

Certainly, alcohol abuse is one of
society’s greatest ills and an
institution like the University

of Student Affairs and Stuent
Activities conducted themselves
clearly concones such misuse.
Let's cut the double standards!
Let's get out University officials to
act like the professionals they claim
to be. And to the Office of Student
Affairs: All of your dreamy-eyed
‘plans for the perfect Orientation
and Freshman Fall Weekend and
all of your “morality" edicts
concerning freshman behavior are
worthless as long as your hypocrit-

ical actions and double standards_

continue.

Working In

Annex "Crisis
Dear Editor:

This letter is to call attention to
and rectify a serious omission made
by the Pitt News in this past
Monday’s article concerning the
Student Union Annex concert ban.

The groundwork being done to
reopen the SU Annex cannot be
credited solely to the Student
Government (SG). The fact is these
efforts are .the joint work of the
Black Action Society (BAS) and the
Student Government. Additionally,
the alternative plans of action to
get the Annex reopened were
discussed between the BAS and SG
at last Friday’s BAS Steering
Committee meeting. I feelgthese
two facts are signiﬁcant because to
my knowledge they represent the
ﬁrst time this year that both
representative organizations have
worked hand in hand to resolve an
issue of mutual concern. Hopefully
this will be ‘just a beginning.

Letters to theiEditor

I A Voice in the

Community

Dear Editor,

Student Government Board (SGB)
action involving the Student Union
Annex is ridiculous and a waste of
time, money and paper. Instead of
confronting the issue the SGB
insists on taking action which will
only result in a bitter dispute
between the students and the
community. In Friday’s Pitt News
Oakland Development, Inc. (ODI)
suggested that student involve-
ment in their organization would be
an effective way to bring both sides
to an agreement. I suggest SGB
representatives meet with the two
block committee and offer the
student side of the story.

Throughout my experiences with
various community organizations,
like ODI, I have found the people to
be both reasonable and fair to all
members of the community. Since
students of the University repre-
sent such a large percentage of the
Oakland community, SGB’s failure
to seek a-voice in ODI shows a
servere inadequacy on the part of
the Student Government.

I’m sure that the boycott and
petitions would be effective, but
why cause a lot of trouble when an
easier solution can be reached.the
SGB’s plan would be a good
alternate route in case meeting
with ODI brings no results.
However, these plans will only
work if SGB has student support
and doesn’t underestimate the
power of ODI.

“It is completely unjustified to continue the policy of not awarding
academic credits for ROTC courses to students in the College of Arts

Mueller.

ROTC: UnchampionedCauseﬁ,

BY JOHN POULIN

Oh. say did you see the siege of
campus ROTC--the bombs bursting
in buildings-—see the fires‘ red
glare—-the tear gas ‘canisters so
gallantly streaming‘? What so
defiantly was attacked in the
twilight of the 60's gave proof
through the dawn of the 70's:
ROTC was still there.

As ‘the smoke cleared the
autumn of 1971 a Pentagon 5 icial
triumphantly hailed, “For campus
militants who tried to destroy
ROTC, they might have won a few
skirmishes--but they lost the war.”

After more than 500 incidents of
anti—ROTC demonstrations and
violence, only ll universities-—inost
of which were lvy League——actually
bounced the cadets off campus.
Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Boston
University, and Stanford were
among the leaders, and surpris-
ingly few followed.

history,” said Dr. George C.

of Defense for Education. “For the

The Reserve Officer’s Training
Corps [ROTC] on campus was
considered a blatant and constant
reminder of the continuing war in
Vietnam to college students
through the turn of the decade.

It was an all-too-visible extension
of that war--its rightness or
wrongness—-into the student's own

life. Responsihlity saluted him.
The war lagged on. Criticism
flared. Tension rocketed. but

buildings were picketed, pilfered
and powder—kegged.

Electric emotions jumped school
administrators, faculty and stu-
dents into hasty decisions on the
future of ROTC. Pitt, like many
schools, settled on the avenue of
compromise. Instead ofousting
the program entirely, or retaining it

intact. the College of Arts and
Science (CAS) faculty (all other

schools at Pitt continued to honor_

ROTC) voted to drop the credits
awarded for ROTC courses--there-
by divorcing the school's affiliation
and reducing approval of the
program to a limited extent.

But by the fall of 1971 the drive to
ban’ROTC from college campuses
had burned out. And almost as
“compromise

credits they were reinstated.
Eight--85% of the colleges contin-
uing to offer the program awarded
credits that school year. Pitt never
reversed its decision. Now--6 years
later--the skeleton remains in the
closet.

Colonel Donald Mueller, the
current commander of the Air
Force ROTC attachment at Pitt said
recently, “It is completely unjusti-
tied to continue the policy of not
awarding academic credits for
ROTC courses to students in the
College of Arts and Sciences. In
my opinion, this decision-—which
followed ‘on the heels of the
Cambodian invasion--was an emo-
tional reaction rather than some-
thing well thought out."

ROTC '

Mueller said the decision was
made exclusively by the CAS
faculty-—without regard to student
opinion. “They totally ignored a
poll in 1969 that showed 2/3 of the
students wanted the credits." he
said. “While some thoughtthey
were punishing the military for our
role‘ in Vietnam, what they actually
did was punish the students."

“Now, a person who comes to Pitt
at night or is in any of the other
schools outside of CAS can get

,credits for the very same ROTC
courses that CAS students don’t
get credit for,” said Mueller.
“This doesn’t make sense.” At
Pitt, 8 "/0 of ROTC enrollment is in
CA8.

In 1969, the worthiness of ROTC
courses for CAS credit was in
question. Were the academic
standards of the program up to par
with other departments? Many
students, and some administrators
felt not. Mueller said he thinks it is
time now for a re-examination of
the ROTC curriculum by CAS.

“There is no doubt in my mind
that academic credit is deserving,”
he said. “All our instructors have
at least a masters degree. All have
subjected themselves to the eval-
uation of the Undergraduate
Academic Review and in almost
every case got a rating which put
them in the top 10% of all
instructors in this university.”

The Air Force ROTC commander
suspects there may be a common
misunderstanding of the nature of
course material among non-ROTC
students. “Students don’t go into

class and disassemble machine_

guns,” ‘he said. “And drill training
has nearly disappeared.” The
material of ROTC courses, Mueller
explained, covers basic topics
taught elsewhere in the University-
political science, history, business,
but tailored to Air Force ROTC
needs.

How about the texts? Well, for
example, there's one titled “A-
merican Defense Policy” by
Wesley Posvar, Pitt's Chancellor.

Still another criticism of Pitt’s
chapter of ROTC which figured in
the 1969 decision to drop CAS

credits was that the University had
no say in the hiring and ﬁring of
ROTC teachers. “That’s no longer
true,” Mueller said. “For the last

two years, every person who has‘ i

come into the department has had
his credentials gone over by the
Faculty Review Board. And in
every case they've had full
approval.”

Enrollment in ROTC at Pitt is at
its lowest level in eight years, and

5- Mueller places much of the blame
‘on the failure of CAS to reinstate

credit. 7 The four-year ROTC
program requires 16 credit hours;
while not counted towards gradua-
tion, this means the ROTC student
must complete a minimum of 136
credit hours of study during his
four years at Pitt, rather than the

, CAS minimum of 120.

"Nationally, ROTC enrollment is
also down. Membership has
plummeted from 212,000 in the
1968-69 academic year to near
75,000 currently. The Defense
Department has seemingly tried
everything in its power to promote
it was opened to
women in 1969. (About 20% of
Pitt’s ROTC unit is women, with a
higher percentage in the first two
years level)_. Scholarship offerings
have been stepped up to a current
6500 full tuition grants which cover
books andisupplies. (35 of Pitt’s
113 ROTC students benefit from
these awards). Adding more spice

.  to the cake are $100 monthly checks
 received by all ROTC students in ’
their junior and senior years. Upon ‘

gradua-tion, the Air Force ROTC
student receives a commission as a
2nd Lieutenant and ' serves a
four-year period.

Mueller said maintenance of the
college ROTC program around the
country is essential. “Seventy-ﬁve
per cent of the officer production

, for the US military comes from,
J“ ROTC,” he said.

“We have a
citizen’s ' army,” Mueller
explained. “ROTC at a public
school draws officers from all walks
of life, and all shade of political
persuasion. If you relied strictly on
the military academies you would
get a one-sided effect."

“It seems to me,” said Mueller,
“that right now this country is
trying to heal some old wounds left
over from the war--Ford’s condi-
tional amnesty, etc. I think we
have some serious woundsl right
here at Pitt. What needs to be
done now is for CAS to take a
serious look at the ROTC, curri-
culum. We would hope that this
year the question of academic
credit could be brought up.”

But who--now six years later--is
ready to champion the cause?

A quote in the voter registration
story, page three. September 30
issue of the Pitt News. “Most of
the students come from the middle
middle class or upper middle class
and usually those levels have gone

attributed to College Young Demo-
crats (CYD) President John Rohe‘.

After 1500 miles spent surveying
more than a dozen Women’s
Studies programs, not to mention
ice cream parlors and pin ball
counters, Karen M. Clay still
radiates exuberance from behind
those ever present aviator photo-
greys.

Clay, a senior majoring in
Women’s Studies, along with
Vivienne Radkoff [philosophy ’76],
Fran Baskin and Susan’ Epstein,
who recently transferred to the
University of Pennsylvania, spent
last summer interviewing facultyof
Women’s Studies programs across
the nation as a supplementto their
comprehensive survey of the 90
programs in this country.

The purpose of the 15 credit
independent study was to deter-
mine the relationship between
women in their traditional depart-
ments as opposed to
involvement in Women’s Studies.

While all of the statistics have not
yet been compiled, Clay is sure of
certain aspectsof the study of
women as- opposed to more
traditional studies. “Working
within a traditional department one
can find research sourcesand the

like easily available, whereas in.

Women’s Studies it is a challenge,
it’s a new frontier," Clay said.
One of the challenges in Women’s

Studies, like any new field of,

education is finding support where
it counts--from administrators.
“The universities won’t avail
themselves to believe it is a serious
discipline. They don’t know
enough about it. When you’re
talking to an all-male hierarchy
about Women’s Studies, they stop
at the word women.”

As a consequence of the study
Rapkoff maintains they will be able
to show‘ women who are having
trouble establishing their programs
that there are women at other
universities with similar problems.

“Did you ask the same questions
elsewhere?” then, “Tell us what
you’ve found," wasthe response
from Women’s Studies programs
across the country. Pitt’s Women’s
Studies Program rated in Radkoff’s
opinion as “the best they had

their"

visited.”

Last winter, the.project had been
just something a group of friends
talked over in the Tuck Shop. The
came enthusiasm and cooperation
from throughout the University:
“We found you can do a lot of
things you want to do just because
there are a lot of things that need to
be done. We just tossed the idea
around and then [Women’s Studies
Coordinator] Mary Briscoe, sug-
gested we do it for credit,” Clay
said. A T

The program, said political

Reading, this year’s sponsor for the

the past three years. It is a series
of courses taken in addition to a

Eligibility requirements for the

there is competition, good grades
will help,” said Reading. “A
student with a 2.0 doesn’t have
much chance of _being accepted for

Two years of either Spanish or

The students. must attend a

Radkoff said, “is not on a power

satiating student needs."
Women’s Studies programs

throughout the country have major
commonalities, Clay and Radkoff
found. In their opinion, the

untraditional nature of the study of .

women allows for change in
teaching methods, making the
typical Women’s Studies course
open and questioning.

“These things are being explored
for the first time. It is a‘mutual
learning experience‘ for faculty and
students,” Radkoff said.. Making

working women in Venezuela.
“The trip is not for everyone,” she
said. “You can’tbe shy. You have
to be willing to go out and talk to
the people.” A

La_rdas ,was surprised at the
similarities between Venezuela and
the US. ‘Caracas looked just like
any city in the US. “l was
surprised to see so many
American-made products in the
stores.” . ‘

Before going to live with their
assigned families in La Victoria,
Venezuela, the students joined a
retreat held by the University for

’Workers, where workers are given ‘

time off by their employers to rea
and',study. -
There the students began adjust-
ing to Latin cultures, and “Latin
Ti-me.” “Latin Time" is usually
two hours later than the actual
time,” said Donna Alston, a junior
at the time of the trip. ‘‘If someone
tells you to be at dinner or a party

at six o'clock you shouldn't show

up until after eight.”

Alston did her project on the
inventiveness of the people in the
farming village of La Victoria. “It
was hard for me to communicate
with the people,” she said. “I had
a nice family though and they tried
very hard to. understand my
Spanish.”

Alexander's Jazz Lifts Spirit

BY DOUG GEBHARD

“Ya' know...you look around Eu-
rope and you see statues of all their
favorite mu'sicians—Beethoven,
ya‘ know. What do you see here in
America? You don't see any
statues of Louis Armstrong, do

ya"."' Monty Alexander's Jamai-
can accent danced around his
speech.

. On his third night of playing...two
shows an evening...in the Union
with the stench of a tarp that had to
be laid down to protect the new
tloor, Monty and his trio (Benny
Nelson on bass and Oliver Jackson
on percussion) held tight through
their first stand and was relaxing

‘ for the second.

“We play to have a good time,”
he said, realizing he’s been playing
since the age of four, studying from
six to 14 with roots in the classical
tradition. “Ya’ know...some peo-

ple like to look for something more I

or heavy in the music, but it’s
really afeeling. If it makes you feel
like smiling, that’s_ good.” His
music reﬂects a distinct jazz tradi-
tion with influences from Peterson,
Jamal and most definitely Garner.
He has written arrangements of
some classic tunes like “Shaft”
which has been retltled...“Shift”
and Al Green’s “Let’s_ Spend the
Night.” ‘

With the trio format in jazz there
is an interdependence each piece

Monty Alexander on his inﬂuences: “It all ‘comes back to Nate [Cole],
but ‘I’ve been inﬂuenced by everything....everybody’s got a story to

tell.”

has on each other piece. Despite
the fact that Monty Alexander
might be the leader he has to follow
the constituent members as much
as they have to follow him.

AbbodoLeocls Opening
Pgh. Symphony Concert p

.Claudio Abbado will conduct the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, in
one series of concerts October 4, S,

‘ and 6. Featured with Abbado in

Mahler's Symphony No. 2 in a c
minor will be soprano Evelyn
Mandac, mezzo-soprano Birgit
Finnila, and ‘the Mendelssohn
Choir of Pittsburgh, Hugh B.
Johnson, Director. '

In addition to his debut here,
Abbado’s schedule for the 1974-75
season willinclude a Russian tour
with the La Scala Opera; a German
tour with the Vienna Philharmonic;
and his Covent Garden debut
conducting Un Ballo in Maschera.

Evelyn Mandac, in a few seasons,

has‘ compiled a list of opera, recital .

and or chestral appearances longer
than some veterans.

Swedish mezzo-soprano Birgit
Finnila has performed with major
orchestras in Europe, Australia,
the USSR, .South America, the
United State and Canade. She is
especially well-known for her con-
cert, recital and oratorio singing,
and she is also a fine operatic
performer.

The Mendelssohn Choir of Pitts-

burgh is composed of nearly 150
men -and women who are non-pro-
fessionals in music and sing be-
cause of their deep interest in
serious vocal music. « It was

organized int‘_l908 as a rnale chorus, .

  

but by 1915 was combined with a

female chorus to give concerts on a
regualr basis in Pittsburgh and
other cities. In 1970, Hugh B.
Johnson became the present Musi-
cal Director.

The Heinz Hall subscription con-
certs are scheduled for 8:30 Friday,
Ocotber 4, Saturday, October 5 at 8
pm, and on Sunday afternnon at 3
pm, Ocotber 6. Although-the entire
series has been sold-out by season
subscriptions, some tickets may
have‘ been returned to the Box
Office for re-sale. Phone 281-5000
for information. '

chasing the melody, the keyboards

‘might very well fall flat. It might

be argued that this supposition
isn't entirely true...look at the
number of piano players doing solo
things in bars, etc. But they are-
exactly that—piano players not
keyboardinstrumentalists. A
The most impressive attribute of
Monty Alexander’s work ‘is the
fluidity with which he ‘moves
between his band and the music...
if they‘ can be considered separ-
able. The members create the
music. They also create the
kharma around which basic taken-
for-granted tenets are explored;
theme, content, harmonic and
melodic changes.‘ Taking the
themes and building on them—-ex-
tending their meaning—seems to
be what turns Monty’s music on.

Gershwin: Child Genius.

Practices  Woy to Jazz ,

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

The story of music is full of
"what-if"'s. For example: What
sort of music would he have
composed if Beethoven had not lost
his hearing‘? What if Mozart had
not died at age 35? What if
Tchaikovsky had not been a de-
pressed homosexual? What if
Charles Ives had been recognized
as a great composer while still in
his productive years? What if
George Gershwin had not died
young? .

If he were alive today, Gershwin
would be 76 years old. Instead, he
died in 1937, at age 

Actually, Gershwin produced a
tremendous output, mostly songs
some still popular, but some never
published. Hestarted his profes-
sional career in 1974 at age 16
by punding a piano eight to ten
hours a day at the Remick publish-
ing house in Tin Pan‘ Alley.

Soon he was in demand as one of
the better pianists in the house.
Apparently, he was the type of

I person who played the piano at the
drop of a hat. If he was at a party,
he was usually at the piano.

He would spend hours improviz-
ing at the piano. Once, it is said,
his mother asked him why. he
always played the piano at parties,

- instead of relaxing ' and letting
someone else for a change. He
replied, “When I’m not playing, I
don’t have a good time.” V

Gershwin sweated away for years

in Tin Pan Alley without producing

any hits, until Al Jolson recorded *

one of his songs, “Swanee," and
made it an international hit.

A couple of years later,‘ Paul
Whitemen asked Gershwin to write
something for his band to play in a-
concert hall appearance, with Ger-
shwin at the piano. The idea was to
produce a peice which would show
the orchestral music world that jazz
was a legitimate art form, deserv-
ing just as much respect as the
serious orchestral stuff of centuries
past. Gershwin produced a work in
just a few weeks of frantic writing,
with the help of Whiteman’s ar-
ranger, Ferde Grofe, which became
what we today call “Rhapsody in
Blue.”

While these women are sure of
the validity of Women’s Studies at

Women-Studies is characterized by
questioning discussion rather than
a proselytizing of facts or dogma,
so also is the future of the program.

“Whether in the European or the
American ‘film, whether seen as
sociological artifact or artistic
creation, women, by the logistics of
film production and the laws of
Western society, generally emerge
as the projections of male values.
Whether as the product of one-
auteur or of the system...women
are the vehicle of men’s fantasies,
the anima of the collective male

‘unconscious, and the scapegoat of

men's fears.”

From Reverance to Rape chron-
icles the treatment of women in
film and shows that the situation
described above has worsened in
recent years.

‘Many readers will be surprised V

portrayals of women have deterior-

cingly documents her argument.
With sections on each decade
starting with the 20’s as well as
“Europeans” and “The Woman’s
Film” Haskell demonstrates the
universality of distorted depictions
of women, also noting several
exceptions.

Haskell believes in the auteur
theory of film criticism which
emphasizes- the vision of the
director. She comments on famous
directors: Ford and Fellini worship
woman as “mother”--she is “kept
in her place, innoculated with’
sanctity against the disease of
ambition;" Renoir and Bergman
treat her as an “earth mother;”
Griffith and Chaplin idealize her;
for Keaton and Hawks “she is
celebrated and feared as separate-
but-equal.”

Haskell writes that today with a

"record number of women “per-g
fulfilling

forming, achieving,
themselves” viewers are faced
with the worst, the most abused,
neglected and dehumanized screen
heroines in film history.

Women received better treatment,
in the 30’s and 40’s: characters
portrayed by Bette Davis, Joan
Crawford, Carole Lombard,
Katherine Hepburn, Margaret
Sullavan and Rosalind Russell were
working women with “intelligence
and personal style and forceful-
nessf’

Films featuring women, eman-
cipated or not, decreased in the
50's: the big films like Shane, High
Noon, Bridge on the River were
male-oriented. In the 60’s women

were shown as “icebergs, zombies

V7

and ballbreakers. Misogynism in
the 70's has spawned films like A
Clockwork Orange and Straw Dogs.

Most major films are still about
men, i.e., The Sting, Scarecrow,
and Deliverance. In fact, just look
at the film listings in a newspaper.
The image of men in film has
changed but the new anti-heroes
have taken on “female qualities”
such as sensitivity, and thus, the
presence of women in film is
further decreased. '

Haskell points outa double stan-
dard in films; male stars like Cary
Grant can play romantic roles for
decades. While they are ‘paired
with young women, their original
co-stars are relegated to character
roles as they grow older, reflecting
society's desirability of older
women.

Haskell elaborates her ideas more
thoroughly than can be conveyed in
this brief review; she combines
humor and personal insight with
film knowledge.

Women and their Sexuality in the
New Film complements From
reverance to Rape. While Rever-
ance focused primarily on older
American films, Mellen's book
concentrates on recent foreign
films. Haskell writes that she is a
film critic first and a feminist
second; Mellen is more radical and
I think more successful when she
deals with the same topics as From
Reverance to Rape.

The best example is both books’
treatment of Ingmar Bergman--
Haskell criticizes Bergman while
acknowledging that he is fairer
than most. Mellen is very critical
of Bergman, primarily discussing
Cries and Whispers. This fine

challenging essay presented me

a

 

"€,\.'.‘

(Confirmed from Page 10)

_with insights I never would have

developed on my own.

Mellen's book is a loosely knit
collection of essays, many of which
have appeared in magazines like
Film Quarterly. Some, like essays
on Rohmer and Visconti's Death in
Venice stray from the central topic
but are enlightening nevertheless.

Mellen's best essay is on Up the
Sandbox. She sliowsj the film is
counter-revolutionary in its ridicule‘
of feminist ideas. Mellcn is at her
best as she exposes the values
underlying characterization and
plot. She ties the movie to the
culture that made it.
f‘Lesbianism in the movies”
shows the infrequency of realistic
treatment of lesbians in film.
Screen lesbians, whether in Berg-
man ﬁlms or less artistic en-
deavors, are stereotyped and pres-

A ented disapprovingly.

 

‘A fine lengthy essay evaluates the
relationship between men 7 and
women in Last Tango in Paris.

Other essays discuss Mae West.
Bunuel’s Tristant and “‘Female
Sexuality in Films.” Mellen writes
that the best of recent ﬁlms show
how social institutions have dis-
Itorted human needs.

This book is worth reading, es-
‘pecially for the essay on Bergman;

»Mellen writes that Bergman

IR’

 

“delights in enclosing his women
characters in a cycle of pain based
on physiology’ at a time when many
women‘ are examining and dis-
covering the means by which they
can move beyond what they have
been.”

Some personal comments: these

two books aren’t the best books of‘

film criticism that I have read but
they have done more to change
viewpoint than works by Stanley
Kauffmann and Pauline Kael.
After reading these works. I have
been led to examine films and other
works of art more critically.

For films do not exist in a vacuum
as both authors know. They reflect
the prevailing cultural values and
stereotypes.

Perceptive viewers have been able
to see through the stereotypes
presented in many ﬁlms. After all,
it’s not too hard to figure out that
characters portrayed by Marilyn
Monroe aren't always plausible.
The value of these books lies in
their exposure of the more subtle

Cinema & Feminism in Review

sexism that exists in many well-
made modern films.

The domination by men in the film
industry makes_unrealistic depic-
tions of women almost inevitable.
Societal stereotyping is so perva-
sive that even some films written
and/or directed by women reflect
the negative image of women in our
culture. ’

.Mellen presents surprising criti— ‘

cism of Kate Millett's Three Lives
and Play It as it Lays. . t
These books go beyond film
criticism to an implied and some-
times explicit denouncement of the
society that oppresses women.
They reflect and perpetuate
society’s gloriﬁcation and limita-
tion of women’s role to mother and
supportive wife. After reading
books such as these, I am more
convinced than ever that
fundamental changes in basic
societal institutions, such as the
nuclear family, are needed. Both-

  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
   
     
  
  
 

 

men and women suffer from the
limitations placed on them by such
institutions in their present form.

1- encourage you to read ‘these
books, at the very least, of your
insight into films and the values
they reflect will be increased. But
these books do not evaluate art as
an isolated phenomenon--they
are more valuablethan most books
of film criticism because they place
films in the context of an entire
society.

Many may already realize the
distortions in screen portrayals of
women (the problems of women
artists are marginally alluded to,
more extensive discussions can be
foundiin ‘Virginia Woolf's A Room
of One’s Own and anthologies such
as Woman in Sexist Society). But
the dimensions of the problem will
be made ever more apparent by the
reading of these books.

Last_ Tango in Paris is the subject of an essay in Joan Mellen’s Women
and ‘Their Sexuality in the New Film. ’ /V

One change that has already been

Wednesday in Minnesotér.., The
exhibition record thus far, includes
four wins and three ‘losses,
indicative of the frequent line
changes made to cut the training
camp roster from S4 to a workable
22.

_ The Pen’s farm team, Hershey,
has to take 10 Penguin players,

among them Pierre Larouche, the
first draft choice. The 18-year old
center, brash and able, slowed
considerably in the exhibition
series, but is expected to be one of
those brought up from Hershey for
the weekend’s games. The
Hershey assignment isinot consi-
dered punitive, for it is Penguin
policy to go easy, on top draft
choices for a while. The feeling is
that Larouche will be skating in
Pittsburgh before very long.
Other draft choices sent to
Hershey are Jacques Cossettee,
right wing; Dennis Owchar, de-
fense; Colin Campbell, defense;
Don Seiling, left wing; Mario

praise from Majors at the weekly
press luncheon for their perfor-
mances against the Trojans.

Majors ran his club through
scrimmages on Monday, not a
usual custom, taking a better look
at his second team offense and
defense. Yesterday he concentrat-
ed on both the first team offensive
unit and the second.

“I'm looking for more zip in the
offense," Majors asserted. “We
had the ball nine times against USC
and eight of those we were beyond
65 yards out. We just didn’t move
the ball.”

While most of the attention will be
devoted to the attack, Majors also
noted that his defensive corps will
receive attention.

“The defense has made the big
plays, but there are still plenty of
areas to be worked on,” Majors
stressed. “We’ve given up a lot of
yards rushing and we need to be
sharper.” .

His first task will be replacing the

BY ANDY BEHREND

An excited Pitt soccer team will
be out to continue their improving
play, as they host Carnegie-Mellon
(CMU) tonight at Pitt Stadium,
7:30. ‘

Coach Leo Bemis anticipates
another torrid battle between the
two local rivals. He cites an early
charge by the Panthers as the key
to victory. }

“We have to take command right
away or else we’ll have a typical

, Pitt-CMU cliffhanger.”

Bemis. is still. pleased with his
troops’ effort at Edinboro Satur-
day. An extension of the booters’
solid play should deter CMU’s
attempt to recover the Oakland
soccer crown. Pitt won last year's

through Gate 9 of the Stadium.

“Our players are looking forward

bone in his left ankle in the dying
minutes of last Saturday's loss and
will be out for four to six weeks.
From his “monster man" position,
Bulino_ recorded nine unassisted
tackles, three assisted stops, an
interception that set up Pitt's only
score, one sacking of the USC
quarterback and a pair of blocked
passes.

Defensive secondary coach Joe
Madden has 5-10, 190 pound
sophomore George O’Korn tenta-
tively filling Bulino’s shoes but
stated that no formal decision has
been .made and that other players
will be getting a crack at the
position. Running behind O’Korn

now is 6-4, 190 pound sophomore
Larry Felton.

Besides Bulino, Majors has only
minor ankle injuries to contend
with, although they were sustained
by three starters. Center Mike
Carey, middle guard Gary Burley
(both went into the USC game
slightly h/obbled) and defensive
tackle Don Parrish all are a bit
wobbly. Defensive end Ed Wil-
lamwski also was injured‘ last
Saturday and is not listed on the
depth chart. .-

This week's practices will include
emphasis on both the running and
passing offense and it is doubtful,
but possible, any serious personnel
changes are forthcoming. , y

“I never keep my patience,"
Majors said, “But I’m not" a
front-runner with my players.

One new twist in the Pitt line-up
will be the addition of Bill Rexon
theright wing, giving the Panthers
needed depth. Rex will be used
sparingly, as his bruised leg -will
not permit him to move at full
strength. ’

An early surprise has been the
rapid development of the fullback
line. Bemis reiterated that the play
of Stan Sbei, Ernie Gross, and
Seniors Mark Venanzi and Jerry

Luxbacher has kept opposing

offenses off-balance. .

The Carnegie-Mellon coach finds
himself in a rebuilding year. Peter
Moses, a thorn to the Panthers in
previous outings has graduated. ,
He has been ably replaced by
junior Charlie Lavalle, at center
halfback.

Other Tartan stalwarts are Pete
Hague, at left half, and Tom
Bennie, an impressive freshman
who starts at inside left.

Yaksich will use his 4-3-3
alignment which he employed in
CMU’s only previous game thus
far, a 3-2 win over Case-Western
Reserve.

“We’ll have no trouble getting up
for Pitt," Yaksich warned. “Our
guys feel a real rivalry exists
between the two clubs, so we’ll be
ready." -
An honest-to-goodness rivalry?
That seems to call for honest-to-
goodness people. The admission is

Near the end of the third quarter of the Steeler-Raiders game. the
ckle Pittsburgh fans sent out a boisterous call for Terry Bradshaw.
hese fans, who had cheered a year ago when Bradshaw was helped off
ftheﬁeld with a shoulder injury, were now calling for the replacement of
oe Gilliam simply because the Steelers were being humiliated by their
-“arch rivals.
. When asked after the game if he had considered taking Gilliam out of
'_the':game,v Steeler coach Chuck Noll replied that he hadn’t but that he
— had considered “taking out the offensive line, the receivers, and about

everyone else.” '
."_'RaLl"l€I' than put the blame on his young, quarterback. Noll cited the
fact that the loss was a total team, effort and that the rest of his players
.were‘ responsbile for the defeat as much, if not more, as “Jefferson
"Street Joe."
Somehow. Noll's logic escapes me. After all, it's much more feasible
.. jto replace one man than the entire team. Likewise, Noll had substituted

1 jfreely at every other position except the quarterback spot. The big
::question is, did Joe Gilliam's play warrent his being taken out of the
3. game?
.A "Joe Gilliam is a quarterback of unquestionable ability; In the two
_games prior to Sunday's fiasco, he had directed the Steeler offense to
65 points. In addition, his outstanding play during the exhibition
season enable the Steelers to begin the regular season unscathed. His
throwing arm had tormented the opposing defenses, adding a new
facet to the Steeler attack which had been missing in the past few
years.

But Joe Gilliam just didn’t have it on Sunday, possibly because the
Steelers were" playing Oakland and not Denver or Baltimore. He
completed only six of his 21 passes in the first half and threw one
interception that set. up the Raider‘s second-touchdown, a pass which
never should have been thrown. ,

The Oakland Raiders came into Sunday's game expecting Gilliam to
put the ball in the air. They ran a three man defensive front throughout
most of the game and their pass coverage was superb. Gilliam wasn’t
able to find the open receivers because there just weren’t any.
Nevertheless, he continued to throw the ball, forcing dangerous passes
or, if the coverage was too tight, throwing it away. He refused to run

with the ball, a tactic which almost certainly would have opened up the

Raider defense. .

Although Gilliam is probably the most talented of the Steeler
quarterbacks, his style of play was no threat to the awesome Raider
defense, which was the best in the league last year. The Steeler attack
needed the hard-headed play of a man like Bradshaw, who runs with
the ball every chance he gets, keeping the defense off balance. But
with Gilliam there was never any doubt in the minds of the Raiders as
to what he was going to do with the ball when he dropped back or rolled
out. He would either throw the ball or get sacked. .

Whether or not Bradshaw would have been able to pull out a win over
Oakland is of little importance. What is important is that the Steelers
didn't stand a chance of getting their second victory with Gilliam
passing on obvious running downs such as first and five and second
and three. He was having a miserable day and the best choice for all
concerned would have been to give someone else a chance.

The Steelers have the best crew of quarterbacks in the NFL. Noll
should have given Bradshaw , or even Hanratty,_a chance to earn his

. keep. There is no luxury in having three ﬁne quarterbacks if only one of

them is going to be used on such an occasion. If the loss was a total
team effort, as Noll‘ said, then Bradshaw should have had a chance to
addsomething to it. In any event, Bradshaw couldn't have done much

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Before-the-game antics were
nothing unusual Saturday. A sign
bidding the Panthers--PUT A
HOLE IN THE TROJANS AND
SCREW ‘EM--(Pitt fans can't seem
to keep their minds out of the
gutter, one girl said) was not more
aggressive than those painted
during less promising seasons.

As usual, the fraternity boys, who
sometimes have a hard time
cheering without yelling drunken
slurs of obsenities, were there too.
And so were the chubby girls, the
ones who memorize the alma mater
so they can sing sweetly on sunny
Saturday afternoons.

BUT HADN'T SOMETHING
CHANGED? After all, the stadium
was jammed--hundreds of Pitt
students had no place to sit.

“I’ve suffered through ﬁve years
of losing," one Pitt graduate
student explained. “And if Pitt is
ever going to do it, they are going
to do it today."

Wednesday, October 2. 1974-THE PITT NEWS—Page 15

An Afternoon of Hope and Hate....

arrogance of fielding a respectable
team capable of playing authentic
big-time football.

Once, during a silent interim
when the stadium announcer
reported that CMU was beating
Oberlin 14-7, one Pitt fan retorted
loudly, “Who in the hell cares
about Carnegie-Mellon? Hey man,
this is big-time!"

It's true. Pitt fans hope for

"something this year. They hoped

for something Saturday. Out in the
hot sun before the game, they
thought this year would be nothing
like Carl‘ DePasqua's tragedy in
1972. But would the Panthers beat
USC? They hoped, but they didn't
know.

One thing was certain, however,
the Panthers deserved respect, and
there would be no singing

“Goodnight, Johnny, we’re glad to-

see you go...” if the team fared

poorly. Pitt fans would be afraid to
be critical.

Jeez. look at the size of this
crowd, would ‘ya. Never, never, in
recent years did so many. fans show
up to cheer exclusively for the
home team. The Notre Dame game
is an annual sellout, but then, half
the fans root for the Irish. But it
was different Saturday. Nearly the
entire crowd of 52,934, despite
other differences, were united in
their HOPES for Pitt's Panthers.

But somehow. for Pitt fans the
success had come too quickly. Last
year's invitation to the Fiesta Bowl
was only a vague memory now, out
in the blazing sun. And the
Panther's number eight ranking in
the Associated Press poll seemed
wonderful, but unrealistic. The
aficionados knew they had a better
team. their HOPES were higher

(Contin1u'z1 on Par/'6 16)

Indeed, there was arrogance
Saturday. Not the arrogance of the
fans at Michigan, Ohio State, or
Nebraska, where National Chem-

A typical Pitt fan fills himself with exuberance in order to withstand
the trials and tribulations of last weekend’s loss to USC. Fans were
found to be filled with hate and disgust--not for Pitt--but for the USC

feet, as they trotted proudly off the
ﬁeld at the game’s conclusion.

Even the referees, who had
almost remained invisible during
the Panther’s bland lead through
three quarters, suddenly became
villains in the last canto, as the
victory slipped away.

But there was no scorn for the
Panthers. While the lead was
maintained but not increased
through three quarters, the specta-
tors remained passive, too afraid to
get worked up for fear of shattered
dreams. Frenzy was reserved for
the. really big plays, like an
interception, a Pitt score, or the
crushing of a USC goal line drive.

Even the announcement that
Notre Dame was losing to Purdue
24-O was greeted by one of the
biggest outbursts of applause in
the afternoon.

hopes and dreams were crushed.
But STILL, STILL, with 1:34 on the

were able to arouse the crowd for
