on, Besides Saving A Life,

May Get Pitt Students A Beautiful Date

Forty minutes of your time and a
pint of your blood—that’s all it
takes to save the life of a seriously
injured American boy who's ﬁght-
ing for his country on the nation’s
ﬁeld of war. The donating of that
single pint of blood is a painless and
pleasant experience; the procedure
is simple and eﬂiicient.

After signing your name on the
registration blank located on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral and
receiving a date for the donation,
your ﬁrst obligation will be to pre-

"sent yourself to the mobile unit at-

tendants at the designated time.

~Then will begin a ten-minute
series of interviews, the ﬁrst of

' which will be a check on name,

address, and age. The age veri-
ﬁcation is especially important, as
you who are not of age must pre-
sent your father's signature of

. ~ permission.

and a further check on your age.
The date of your last donation must
be carefully checked and veriﬁed, as
two donations within sixty days
will not be permitted.

Certain physical qualiﬁcations
must be met before your applica-
tion for the donation can be ac-
cepted. The third step in the rou-
tine includes a physical examina-
tion. Here, a nurse will check
your temperature, pulse rate, re-
spiratory rate, and blood pres-
sure; a hemoglobin index will be
taken to determine the quality of
your blood.

Your next step will be to make
yourself comfortable on one of the
unit’s sixteen beds. (Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, director of Men’s Student
Health service, who is sponsoring
the drive for donations, suggests
that it is here that the most pleas-
ant part of the entire procedure
will begin, because there will un-

will arise, and a date -for the follow-
ing Friday night will be made.)
However, to go on, after making
yourself comfortable (as well as
sociable) a nurse or technician will
cleanse your arm with alcohol, and
will inject a drop of novocaine. This
anesthetic will ’prevent any pain
whatever.

The doctor will then inject a
hollow needle into a vein, and
through the small tube attached,
one pint of your blood will ﬂow
into a bottle. The actual donation
takes close to twenty minutes,
which is ample time for you to be-
come well acquainted with your
friend on the next bed.

After a short rest, you will be
instructed to go to the unit’s can-
teen, where meat or cheese sand-
wiches will be served to you, along
with all the coffee, tea, milk, or
cocoa that you can drink. “This, of
course, will present an excellent op-

All kidding aside, gang, they need

next week, turn them in at the Post

“Committee members, who are
connected with various student ac-
tivities, fraternities, and sororities,
are responsible for seeing that each
group gets in as many hangers as
it can,” said Paul Schaughency,
BA43, chairman of the drive. They
are requested to come to a “quick

Amos Announces 

Pitt Red Cross
Drive Results

Totals amounting to $2,335.50
for the faculty Red Cross Drive
were announced today by‘ Dr. J.
E. Amos, associate professor of
Finance, and Dr. Ford E. Curtis,

— a

associate professor of English, co- . 

chairman of the drive. This almost
doubles last year's $1,478.25. Not
included is the Mellon Institute’:

$1,580.00, which under normal ciro _£;., 
cumstances would be included in ~  

the University totals. ‘ i

“I’m particularly pleased with-
the results of this year’s drive,”
said Dr. Amos, “in view of the
fact that there is no way of know-

'ing the outside subscriptions made «

by these same people. Estimates
show they have given hundreds‘-of
dollars to other local organiza-
tions."

The list of subscribers numbers ‘ '
over 380, including the buildings’

and grounds personnel, faculty and

office personnel. “There has been 9..

greatly reduced number of people.

and no comparative war increase‘

in wages. This is much to the
credit of Pitt personnel,” said Dr.
Amos.

The only subscription from an

organization was secured through
the efforts of Dr. Manuel C. E!-
mer, professor of Sociology and
the head of the department. It was

in the form of a check for $43.53.
from the Social Worker’s Club of’

Pittsburgh, which is now extinct.
This amount represents the end
of their treasury.

E. Convention

"University war savings stamps
‘and bonds committee, headed by
Ruth Becker, Ed44, began working
on the second national war bond

made $300 in the past few weeks.
and a jeep costs $500.”

the third round of women’s fra-
ternities selling stamps on April
21. The war savings committee
has sold over $33,000 in stamps
and bonds since it was organized

» Recently a national war bond and stamp drive sta.rted
over the country with the highest goal ever set. Each state,
county, city, town, borough, and even school is pledged or
should be pledged to do its utmost to support the drive.

 T‘ For," after all, it is for ourselves and for the preservation
of our way of living that the drive is being carried on." With
the money collected by the campaign, guns and tanks and food
will be sent to our soldiers and allies, not only on the battle-
ironts, but to their hungry and ill-clothed people on the home
 V ronts.
' Only cold cash will buy supplies for Eisenhower in
Africa. Just imagine how each American would feel and
every Allied supporter would feel, if our successful advances
in Tunisia would be stopped.

» ’_ We are now contented with our victories there, but if we

J would be halted, the whole world would feel the effects. Vic-
, tories can only be won by troops better armed, better equipped,
and better fed than. the enemy. Without funds, our troops can-
'=’11ot be better armed, better equipped, and better fed. Defeat
— might result. V

 ’_ ‘ Thus concretely should we imagine what the outcome
,'will be if we fail to buy more and more bonds and stamps.

, . Evidence is ample to prove that although we have done
 a ‘good job in the past, our record is not as good as it could
:9 I and shoud be. In the drive at school, our motto has been “a

 ..je.ep a week.” But in the past few weeks only $300 has been
 ’ collected. '

1; ‘It takes $500 to buy one jeep!

_ "Allegheny county has its quota to reach and the Univer-
 sity is a part of this ‘county. The success and failure that the
county has in reaching its goal depends as much upon Uni-
.~.versit.y students as it does upon their fathers and mothers,
 relatives, and friends. ‘

 Students at the University are devoting their time and
’ effort to aid in the sale of bonds and stamps. They receive no
 compensation except the feeling that they are doing their pa-
;_ triotic duty. "Everything is being made as simple as possible
so-that the student body may purchase the stamps and bonds.
‘ The least every student can do is buy one or more quarter

‘ stamps. It is not as if they are doing anyone a‘ favor, or that
"they are donating money which is lost forever, but inreality,
_. they are buying a share in America and doing a part of their!
 job on the home front to help thewar effort.

- . 3  Soldiers ﬁght and still buy war bonds and stamps. Civilian

-Students should make up their minds to equala propo_rt_ion, of
 their sacriﬁce. We are- the men a.nd women behind the man
 behind the guns. If we fail them, half of our chance for victory
 is gone. .
