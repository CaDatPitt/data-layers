New Senior
Prize Award

Committee To Hold First
Meeting Ngt Friday;  
Plan Is Changed

Thirty-one students, named to
the University Award Committee

sentative Pitt senior, will hold an
organization meeting next Friday

panied by a statement of the nom-
inee's qualifications and a recapitu-
lation of the reasons why in the
judgement of the signers, the candi-
date should be selected for the
award. Under the plan by which
the former Pepper Prize was con-
ducted, only members of the com-
mittee could make nominations.

A second change provided this

shall act as non-voting chairmen ,t
all sessions of the committee. ,

Cap and Gown
Plans Revue

   

 

Current Show Nearing
Opening Date

Planning ahead while in the
throes of rounding the current pro-
duction into shape is the policy of
the Cap and Gown Club.
 Departing radically from the
usual “type of show produced by
Cap and Gown, next year's effort
will be a revue, patterned after the
work of the Messrs. White, Car-
roll, and Zeigfeld, et al.

In place of a libretto; the show
will consist entirely of a series of
short satyrical skits, novel stage ef-
fects, and tuneful melodies.

The belief that such a show will
provide a greater opportunity for
undergraduates to contribute skits,
songs, and costume and stage ideas
was the reason “given by Walter
Rome, graduate manager, for the
club's conteIuplated._ change in
policy. _ 3

“Efforts were made this year to
obtain a student-written show, but
most of the material submitted
was found to be impractical,” said
Rome. “In a show which will be

Backers of Measure Lodge
Protests With Deans’
Oﬂice; Seek Revote

 

The petition for the dissolution
of Student Council suffered a two
to one defeat in the special refer-
endum vote held on campus Mon-
day. A negative vote of 751 to 365
was rolled up, showing a total of
less than 25 percent of the student
body voting.

Immediately upon completion of
the ballot count, joint protests
were lodged with the offices of the
Dean of Men and the Dean of Wo-
men, charging irregularities in vot-
ing at polling places and demand-
ing a revote on the proposed chang-
es. The protest was made by Rich-
ard Phifer, Bus. Ad. ’32, Wayne
Weaver, Bus. Ad. '33, and Lucien
Fugassi, Jr., Col. ’32. sponsors of
the petition.

No action had .been taken on the
protest this week, but it was ex-
pected that in the event the re-
sults of the referendum were upheld,
the defeated faction would repeti-
tion’ for a second vote on their re-
forms.

Charges and counter-charges
were hurled by both factions
throughout the day of voting, each
charging the other with alleged
misconduct at the polling places.

-Rumors of violations of.-..tha.....elec-

tion procedure were heard on every
hand as members of the elections
committee and self-appointed inves-
tigators toured the halls in search
of evidence of fraudulent voting.

In a joint statement issued Wed-
nesday, the three sponsors of the
unsuccessful petition said:

"We. have protested the recent
referendum because of the obvious
irregularities at the respective poll-
ing places, the most glaring of
which was the fact that all of the
polling officials were representa-
tiwes of the group wishing to retain
the present form of Student Coun-
cil."

It was also pointed -out by the
petitioners, in giving their reasons
for wishing to abolish the present
form of Council, that:

“Council has not done anything
truly constructive for the better-
ment of the student body in gen-
eral,” -and that:

“The majority of the power in
the present form of student govern-
ment is held by a definite group
which is only a fraction of the Uni-
versity enrollment . . a system
which is definitely oligarchie and
which is to be avoided if our stu-
dent body is to progress in the
way that it should.”

_ The sponsors of the petition de-
clined to reveal any of the other
evidence submitted in support of
their charges, pending the outcome
of their protest.

Edward Baker, Dent. ’32, chair-
man of Elections committee, de-
clined to make any statement at
present on the results of the refer-
endum other than:

“Monday’s election was as fair
as possibly could have been ex-
pected under the "existing ‘circum-
stances.”

It was being rumored, however,
that some action might be expected
from the Dental School, through
Dental Student Council, within the
next few days, ’

Vitamin C;

Extracted From Lemons

For five years, Dr. C. C. King,
professor of Chemistry, and his
associates, have labored for a so-
lution long sought by research
scientists the isolation of
Vitamin C.

On ‘Monday, Dr. King announced
that the Vitamin had been isolated
and accurately identiﬁed.

The Vitamin was concentrated
from lemon juice_ according to Dr.
King who says that it is plentiful
in lemons, oranges, tomatoes, pota-
toes, and certain other vegetables
and fruits.

Its effects upon the human body
have been known for some time, Dr.

King said, but how it accomplishes .plants,” he said.

its tasks has remained a mystery.
It was known that the lack of
Vitamin C in the diet of humans.
resulted in scurvey and forms of
malnutrition. , .
Dr. King fed the substance he
identiﬁed as Vitamin C to -guinea

vitamin were excluded from the
diet of the little animals. Dr. King
found that they did not develop
scurvey and that their vitality was
not impaired

Pressed for explanation, Dr.
King said the principal significance
of the result is “that it is one more
step in understanding the chemical
reactions which characterize nor-
mal processes of living tissues. It
will make possible further study
of the specific role that Vitamin C
plays in the body.”

“It appears likely that Vitamin
C must be Phesent in the tissue in
practically all higher animals and

normal metabolism to proceed. It
is particularly important to growth

Debate Card

Traveling Team Returns
From 10-Day Tour
of the South

 

- Pitt debaters met three visiting
university teams during the past
week. On April 5, Strauss and
-Boreman debated Landrum Bolling
-and E. R. Caraway of the Universi-
ty of Tennessee, and Bracken and
Butterbach met the varsity of
’Western Reserve University. Yes-

-terday Butterbach and Shapira met

the touring Colby College team.
All three debates were on the cen-
tralized control question.

Thirty-five members of the audi-
ence had their convictions changed
by the logic of Strauss and Bore-
man in the Tennessee fracas. The
debate, Oregon style, was held be-

fore an enthusiastic audience of the
Catholic Daughters of America.
The Tennessee team was the same
that met Bracken and Butterbach
onthe recent southern trip.

A very even debate took place at
the B’n'ai Israel Congregation‘ so-
cial hall between the Pitt and
Western Reserve teams. The audi-
ence sentiment seemed to favor the
recently returned Pitt southern
team.

Washington and Lee debaters
will be met here on April 21, and
the following day Boreman and
Sandler will go to State College
for a. debate with the Penn State
wranglers.

Southern Tcam Returns

The debating Panthers, Bracken
and Butterbach, arrived back in
town last Sunday after an extensive
conquest of the south, including
the battlefields of the Civil War,
Chattannooga, Chicamaugua and
others. ‘

Butterbach converted many to
his theories concerning social
problems. It is reported that he did
it in the same way that one man
changes the minds of an entire
jury.

Bracken spoke to a political
science class -at North Carolina
University on the workings ‘of
Pittsburgh municipal government.
The travelers voted their stays
at Emory ‘College, Sewanee and
North Carolina University to be the
most enjoyable of the entire trip.
They were specially pleased
again debate Edward S. Lanier and
McBride Fleming Jones of the
North Carolina school, the same
team that they debated at home
earlier in the season.

Two decision debates were held
on the trip. At Emory ‘College two
judges split and at Wake Forest,
Pitt got the decision two to one.
The Wake Forest debaters are the
champions of North Carolina.

in the Stanley Theatre after which
he plans to attend the opening per-

was in 1917 when «hewmade his first

parts in succeeding ‘productions, at
two-season London engagement
where he played in “Little Nellie

prominently cast in such musical

BY J. JAMES MOORE
Styledom’s ﬂashy spring toggery
may be all right for “glgolos,” but
Pitt coeds are opposed to men pa-
rading the campus in the new col-
ors.

“Orange socks, green hats and
pink suspenders are only fit for
circus parades,” said Elaine Blan-
velt: Betty Dunn and Eleanor Stuv.e
consider the new men's styles “too
gaudy and garrish," while Ruth
Malone called them “effeminate.”

“College men should press the
clothes they have, instead of buy-
ing one of those new rainbow
suits," declared Dorothy Lackner.

Dolores Weslager of the Panther
staff thinks that if men are going
to wear the new pastel shades they
should also powder their hair and
rouge their cheeks. Any man who
wears “duds” colorful enough to
match'his fraternity banner should,
“go hide in a. tulip bed,” said

The girls’ opinions are exactly
opposite to those of Dean Thyrsa
Amos who recently said that menfs
dress is “too drab and puritanical.”

Plain clothes undoubtedly appeal
more to coed hearts. Ada Walker
and Sally Rodgers have decided to
give the “zero shoulder” to all men

make them look "like—gigolos.”
Further proof that the men will-
have a lonesome time of it if they
adopt the new shades was ‘evidenc-
ed by two other .opinions. “The
girls -"should shun and even .-ostra-
cize any man who wants to dress
like a peacock,” said Ruth Drum.

Thesis Information __, ”

 

Four senior students of the de-
partment of electrical engineering

have been conducting tests on
street cars of the Pittsburgh Rail-

which will be used in their theses.
Carl Hartwig, Charles Collman,
VVilliam Piercy and Henry Black-
burn‘ made the tests on Fifth ave-
nue cars during the past three
months. Round trips into the city

. were started from Wilkinsburg on

cars ‘on “regular service ‘and on
cars with “deadloads'? at night. .

‘ The purpose of the tests was to
determine the efficiency of the cars
equipped with the redesigned mot-
ors and a new air brake valve. They
found that the horsepower of the
cars was increased 38 percent, the
rate of deceleration increased: 25

33 1-2 percent.

was obtained by decreasing the
-efficiency of the cars. The stu-

of the newly equipped cars with

-iwhic has resulted’ in a faster
sche 1e and better, service. Engi-
neers of the railways company fol-
lowed the work of the students
very closely.

“The best find this town has had
in years”—“a born virtuoso”—- in
his playing, the hkh lights are first
stirring rhythm_ a buried fire, and
a sense of worship for the finest
music." These are some of the
comments which have been arous-
ed by the playing of Henry ‘Harris,
Pittsburgh pianist, who is being
presented by W. C. E. L. in a re-
cital Monday afternoon, at 3:30
o’clock in Heinz House.

Harris will be introduced by
John Frederick Lissfelt, local mus-
ic critic, with whom he has appear-
ed in illustrated lectures-with-mus-
ic throughout the country.

As for ‘a personal sketch of this
young musician——he is a graduate
of Schenley High school, where he
played in the school orchestra as
accompanist. On the night of his
graduation, he left for -Leipzig,
Germany, to study under the music
masters of that city, including.Rob-
ert Teichmuelier. Later he went to
Paris. where he was taught by
Wanda Landowska, and where he
made his formal debut in December
1930. His hobbies are reading and
hiking, and he usually spends his
summers in the mountains of Eu-
rope, where he attends the’festi-
vals in Salzburg and Munich.

Business Men

Finish Series

Thursday Lecture Meets
Brought to Close

 

 

The Pitt Business Men's Lunch-
eon Club concluded its second year
of activity last Thursday with the
completion of a series of talk on

the subject of “TransDortation."
Sponored by Alpha Kappa Psi, pro-
fessional fraternity in .commerce,
the group has met regularly in the
Chamber of Commerce building to
hear selected speakers discuss the
economic situation of the country
from varied viewpoints. Twenty-
two meetings have been held dur-
ing the five months period. Topics
which have been brought to the. at
tention of the business men include
.an economic review of 1931, a dis-
cussion on the» emergency mea_s-
ures proposed by President Hoover
the problem of taxation, an olfiline
of production planning by industry
today, and a debate on the relative
value and worth of leading meth-
ods of transportation, railroads,
motor vehicles, and inland water
transportation. ., ,

Organized in 1929, the first year
of the Business Men's Luncheon
Club, was confined to members .,of
the fraternity. At the suggestion of
Lloyd Mahoney, faculty adviser of
the organization, it was decided to
throw open the meetings to any
who wished to attend. During the
present series, the average record-
ed attendance at the meetings has
been forty men. ’

A more ambitious schedule of
luncheon meetings is now being
prepared for the coming year. The
meetings will begin the first week
in November, and close the last
week in March. To make it profit-
able to students in the University,
an arrangement is being worked
out with the registrar, that will
permit a selected list of seniors in-
terested in finance and commerce
to secure University credit for at-
tendance at the meetings. It is pro-
posed to give two credits for the
lecture course; the only cost will
be for luncheons.

Included in the list of speakers
at the meetings held this year have
been four University instructors:
professors Montfort Jones, J. W.
W. Hallock, and Marion McKay, J.
W. Fitzgerald and H. C. Kidd.
Other speakers were: Dr. Ralph J.
Watkins, director of the University
bureau of -business research; L. T.

Retail Students Hear
Horne Head at Meeting

H". M. Phifer, for many years
store manager of the Joseph Horne‘
Co., discussed with the student_s of
the Research Bureau for Retail

Training the Quota Bonus Plan of
wage payment now in effect at
Horne’s. This plan has been recog-
nized by such authorities as Paul
H, Nystrom who said “Horne’s
quota bonus plan is the most equi-
table plan in use in any store.”
Mr. Phifer said that the i-deal
sales salary plan should be simple
in operation, easily understood, an
fair to the employee and employer.
It should promote interest and ef-
ficiency; show comparative worth
of efich salesperson, provide for ad-
justment of salaries at regular in-
tervals; be based on production
and allow an adequate fixed table
wage; and provide a bonus on -all
sales in excess of the quota.‘

Senior Coed Class Picks
Dresses For Graduation

 

Regulation white dresses for
senior week were chosen at a meet-
ing of senior women held Monday
at 12:30 in Heinz House. Following
the tradition of former classes the
women of the graduating class
have chosen three dresses from
which each may pick the one she
prefers to wear during the senior
week exercises.

Since it is necessary for the
stores to order the dresses imme-
diately, orders should be placed at
once with Marjorie Gearhardt,
chairman of the committee, or with
the store itself The dresses may be
tried on in Kaufmann’s Princess
Shop, or in the Inexpensive Shop
at Horne’s. Payment will not be
necessary until the dresses are re-
ceived.

Kappa Sigs Await Game
With Tartan Champions

Due to the fact that four of the
five regulars of the Kappa Sig In-
terfraternity championship basket-
ball team attended the athletic ban-
quet last night, the game scheduled
for yesterday with Englebrecht
Hall, the intramural champions of
Carnegie Tech, was postponed un-
til the early part of the coming
week.

The contest will be held on Wed-
nesday. On that same evening, Phi
Gamma Delta, the runners-up from
Pitt, will meet Kappa Sigma the
runners-up from Tech, in a prelim-
inary to the championship game.

Schricker To
Fight:Lo_night

Penn State Scene’ of
Olympic Tryouts

 

Tonight, at the Penn State gym-
nasium Jack Schricker, 'tt’s lone
representative in the In rco1legi-
ate Olympic boxing tryouts will do
his best to bring the championship
to Pitt.

Schricker holds the 155 P011113
crown in the Intercollegiate Box-
ing Conference, and will fight at
160 pounds at the State tryouts.

Four collegiate champions of the
160 pound class are entered, and as
the number of entries in this class
is greater than that of any other
class, it may be necessary for the
boxers to fight more than one op-
ponent each evening. This seems
certain when one considers that
the matches are only scheduled for
Friday and Saturday nights, April
8 and 9.

Every college of any -national

tourney. -

The main ‘detour that seems to
lie between Schricker and the title
seems to be Joe. Moran, of Syra-
cuse. However, there are plenty of
other good boxers in that class who
may prove too stubborn to be de-
feated. Schricker and Moran have

did meet Syracuse. Instead of fight-I
ing Schricker, Moran fought Siegel
that night and gained a technical
kayo. Moran holds the Intercollegi-
ate Association 155 pound title,

For the past week Schricker has
been working out with various
members of the boxing team, fight-
ing at least one man in each
weight to get the difference in
speed and punch.

Coach Orsini and Schricker
drove up to Penn State yesterday
in order to give Schricker a rest
and time to get a little workout be-

fore the bouts begin.

 

The twenty-fifth annual Inter-
scholastic Track and Field Meet
of the University of Pittsburgh, to
be held at 'the Stadium Saturday,
May 7, 1932, promiseslto eclipse all
former high school track and field
meets held in this section of the
country. '

Entry blanks are being sent out
this week, but six schools have al-
ready entered men in the track
ca.-rnival. To iWarren (Ohio) high
school, New Castle high, last year’s
winners, Steubenville high, Union-
town high, Erie East and Erie
Strong Vincent high go the honors
of having the first entries. All six
schools sent in their entries as
soon as the news of the coming
meet was released.

Extremely lavish arrangements
have been made to give the ath-
letes the best treatment possible.

of Duquesne University, and re-

Hold Buffet Luncheon

A buffet luncheon will be served
all -coaches and officials at the sta-
dium. Competitors will also be
served if they desire.

In celebration of the silver anni-
versary meet, a special medley re-
lay will be run off in addition to
the regular events. The winning
team will receive a handsome fig-
ure trophy. .

To prevent protests over close
finishes, Director Hagan has an-
nounced that a slow motion camera
will take pictures of the finishes of
closely contested races, and the
winner will not be announced until
the film has been developed.

Instead of the usual gold medal,

Tennis Team
Begins Drills

Netters
Season Monday

 

The Pitt tennis team will begin
‘practice Monday on the Stadium
vcourts in preparation for a thirteen
;match schedule. In addition to the
district teams, matches have been
carded with Navy, Georgetown and
Maryland.

This year, despite the loss of
Captain Eddie Jacobs and Milt Co-
hen, No. 1 and 2 men respectively
the Panthers look forward to an-
other undefeated .season, basing
their hopes on the unusual strength
of last--year’s Freshman team.

The fight for the first three
ranking positions will be between
Billy O’Loughlin, Billy Jacobs, and
Nate Ganger, the latter two mem-
bers of last year’s frosh team. Let-
termen ‘Captain Ed Alcorn, Irving
Goodman, Walter Adler, and Chuck
Vollmer are also on hand .to round
out 3. well balanced team“.

Pitt tennis has been on an un-
usually high plane for the last
three/or four years. In this time
they have lost only one match and
that was to the University of Cal-
ifornia in 1930 when Eddie Jacobs
was forced to default due to a
sprained back.

Dr. William McEllroy, assistant
dean of the School of Medicine and
a Pitt net star of 1914, is coaching
the team.

The 1932 tennis schedule is as
follows:

April 23 _________ __Duquesne at Duquesne
April 29 ____________ "Bethany at Bethany
April 30 _________ “Wash-Jeff at Wash.-Jeff

In Next Campaign

 

Selection of Don Smith to lead the 19.32.33 basketball team
was-popularly received at the annual sports banquet at Webster
Hall last night. Smith, who will be the only man returning for
next year ’s team with two varsity letters to his credit, has been

outstanding in the play of the

Panthers during the past two

years and has been mentioned on several of the district, Eastern

Gand national all-star selections.

Erie Mermen
Retain Title

Jack Hanna Wins Two
University Titles _

 

Swimming in splendid form, a
quintet of Erie ‘Strong-Vincent
high school swimmers splashed to
their fourth consecutive Pitt Inter-
scholastic Swimming Champion-
ship. Carrick High, of Pittsburgh,
won the runner-up berth. In con-
junction with the interscholasticI
event_ the individual championship
of the Pitt squad were run off.

Four meet‘ records and one Uni-
versity record fell before the on-
slaught of swimmers. \

Bill Rollinger, Erie Academy
star, bettered the old mark of 19

seconds in the 40 yard free style
by completing the distance in 18 4-5
seconds. --

In the 200 yard free style, Labet-
ta, of Munhall, ﬁnished in 2:27 1.5,
beating the old mark set in 1930,
by Lindberg, also of Munhall.

New Relay Record

A third record was established by
the Strong-Vincent relay team in
the 160 yard event; when Sugart,
McGovern, Mattis, and Higgins
covered the distance in 1:21 2-5.
The old record of 1.22 was estab-
lished nine years ago.

In the junior high school events,
Duquesne lowered Knoxville’s old
mark to 1:17, in the medly relay.

The only University mark that
fell was in the 440 yard free-style.
Hanna covered the distance -in
5:21 4-5, breaking his own time
established last year. Hanna also
annexed the 100 yard title.

Herman Adlersberg. Joe Schmeil-
er, and Carrick wound up with the
other three university champion-
ships_ winning the 40 yard free
style, 200 yard breast strike, and
1'-3110)’ diving, respectively.

The summary of the University

Like Tim lLawry, whom he sue-
ceeds, Smith had a hard time mak-

ing his freshman team; and he did .
not win a regular berth until mid- .

way in the campaign when the in-
eligibility of Bernie Leech, regular
center, caused frosh coach Paul
Zehfuss to switch Smith to the
center berth after he had alternated
at a guard position with Rocco
Cutri during the early part of the
campaign. a
Work Out Out

The shining light on a losing
team this year, Smith will have
his- work cut out for him when next
seaon roll around. Five Big Ten

teams, including Purdue and North- I

western, winners and runnersup,
respectively, in this year’s play,
Notve Dame, Carnegie, Tech, Tem-
ple, Georgetown, Duquesne, and the
two, service quintets among others
are on Pitt’s card.

Russ Ochsenhirt and Don Maca-
mant are the lone lettermen from
this year’s team who will be back
to aid Smith next year. Cribbs
and Brook of this year’s freshman.
team, Charley Hughes, who played
a bangup game until declared in-
eligible in the middle of the sea-
son, and Morry Rubinstein, Dog
Carlson’s mystery man, will be the
others who most likely will figure
in the battle for varsity positions. '

Siegel Captain. ’

Selections of Francis Siegel to
lead next year’s boxing team, and
of Hanna and Adlersberg to lead
the swimmers also proved popular
choices. 1 p 

Siegel is the most colorful boxer
in Pittsburgh , collegiate circles.
His method of ﬁghting kept the

crowd on its feet during most of ‘- '

his ﬁghts. His team will also face
a tough row with West Virginia,
Army, Navy, Harvard, Duquesne,
Carnegie, Tech, and Wash—Jeff on
the program. ‘
Mario Rubbo and possibly Joe

Pitt Spikers
Prepare For
F i r st Meet

Buckeye Team Makes
Appearance Here
April 23

 

 

With the first outdoor dual meet "

of the season only two weeks away,
Coach Shea is driving his trackers
hard in an effort to whip them into
the best possible shape.

The first meet of the season will
be with Ohio State here at the
Stadium, April 23. As has been the
custom in the past, the Buckeyes
are expected to have a very power-
ful squad.

Last year Pitt traveled to Colum-
bus and was very decisively wall-

oped, 102-33. In 193:1, the Panthers
also met the Buckeyes and were
defeated 97-38.

Buckeyes Strong

Naturally enough the Panthers
are only too eager to get another
crack at Ohio State. Eager or not,
however, the Pitt boys will have to
show plenty of stuff to be able to
bea_t.a.team of the -calibre of the
Buckeyes.

The visitors will be headed by
Jack Keller, ranked by many ex-
perts as the greatest high hurdler
in the world, Keller is a sure bet
and is being
counted upon to win an event or
two for the United States in the
international meet. Keller is prac-
tically certain to win the hurdling
events for his team here, as Pitt
has no hurdler to compare with
him.

The Pitt team is well rounded
this year, and this balance should
help it. “Both (in the ciiiders and in
the weights, the Panthers are com-
paratively strong. The jumpers are
possibly only average. but they can
hold up their end nevertheless.

Keller: in Limelight

Bill Keller may take as many
points as his namesake from Ohio.
Bill is running in his accustomed
form and style and to beat him out
his Buckeye rivals will have to
move plenty fast. This meet will
probably give Bill his first chance
since he entered college to run at

So p h s e t e
Worthy Fresh,

Merit Panthers Awarded
At Luncheon Friday

 

 

Customs Committee announces
the Merit Panther luncheon for.the
new freshmen which is to be held
next Friday, April 15. at 12330
o’clock. ' .

The luncheon is an innovation of
this‘ semester. Prior to this time
Merit Panthers were bestowed on
freshman women who were consid-
ered to have upheld the Pitt tradi-
tion, at an afternoon tea with the
customary ritual. This semester,
because of the small number of new
freshmen,=.approximately forty,’ Cus-
tfoms Committee has found it possi-
ble to make the award at a lunch-
eon.

The awarding of the Merit Pan-
ther to freshman women dates back
six years. The Panther of that time
was a large blue and gold felt af-
fair to be worn on sport sweaters.
A few years later a silver stick pin
was adopted. The present type of
pin came into being two years ago
and is a smallibrooch with the im-
age of the Panther in silver.

The luncheon comes unusually
late. this year, six weeks after the

tating minor changes in the ritual.
Dorothy ‘Lewis, Ed. ’34, chairman of
Customs, has appointed Norma Cib-
ula, Ed. ’34, as chairman in charge<
of ritual and program. Vera Wer-
linich, Ed. ’34, is social chairman
for the affair.

The women who will receive
Panthers next Friday, will have
complied with the following regu-
lations:

1. Attend, events planned especially
for freshmen during the first six weeks
of school.

2. Have a “C” average, no failures
or incomplete work.

3. Comply wibh customs regulations.

4. Be regular attendant at Senior
Mentor meetings.

5. Pass customs test on speciﬁed
dates.

6. Show true Pitt spirit.

7. Maintain a friendly attitude to-
ward upperclass women, toward fresh-
men women. toward the faculty, and
toward the administration. -
Freshmen women who plan to at-

tend are requested to sign up in
the Heinz House with Miss Ditt-
man.

A request of the faculty of the
School of Engineering, that coop-
erative work for students be op-
tional, has been approved bythe
Board of Trustees and Chancellor
Bowman, it was announced Wed-
nesday by Dean E. A. -Holbrook,
of that school. ~

With the exception of the School
of Mines, co-op work has been “a re-
quirement for every engineer mat-
riculating at the University. This
new plan for practical work by
students is similar to the optional
plan being used at Massachusetts
institute of Technology, New York
University, and other leading en-
gineering schools of the country.

Beginning with the first semes-
ter, 1932-33, students in the engin-
eering school will be allowed to
elect cooperative work, or they may
elect to take regular classroom
work without the industrial experi-
ence. If suitable positions are not
available for all the selection for
the work will be made on the basis
of scholastic standing. “In any
case,” said Dean Holbrook, “a stu-

Freshmen entering the School of
Engineering in September will re-

their first year. In May, they may
or may not elect cooperative work
for the remainder of their course.
Those electing to take such work
will follow the present schedule.
Those electing not to follow this
procedure will attend school both
semesters during their undergrad-

summer work.

In the case of all civil, mining

Stressed In
Spring Work

Blocking and Tackling
Hold Attention of
Grid Candidates

 

The basic fundamentals of foot-

spring football sessions to date.

Lengthy sessions at the tackling and
P o

blocking dummies are taking “D 3-

majority of the time. and all line
candidates seem intent on giving
the dummies a few pointers on the
noble game called football. Inci-
dentally, a dummy can’t talk
back.

The blocking and tackling ses-
sions are followed by a few short
hours at kicking and passing. The
guards, ends and tackles are rapid-
ly learning to take the dummies
out of the plays easier than was
formerly thought possible.

The work of finding a kicker to
succeed Rip Collins is progressing
rapidly, and at least five men are
trying for the job. The P0535011
holds a promise of being regular
for the successful candidate. In
practice punting, Heller, Hogan,
and Cutri crowd the spotlight, and
are getting off some beautiful spir-
als, Heller is more consistent than
the other two, and seems likely to
do the kicking.

Love Tries Kickoff

Johnny Love, immense Panther
tackle, holds the inside track in
the matter of kickoffs. Not only
does Love hold the inside track,
but the other lanes and part of the
grandstand. ‘Love is plenty fast and
can out kick any member of the
squad. Last year, at certain stages
he got off kicks that rivaled and
excelled MacMurdo’s.

The spring workouts are suppos-
ed to give the coach an idea of
what the team is likely to do in the
coming season. If the work to date
can be taken as a criterion, the
teams who play the Panthers next
season, -and who expect to have an
undefeated season, had better can-
cel their games with the Golden
Cats.

Strong Aerial -Game

The forward passing of the Pan-
there is not being neglected by any
means. The Panthers discovered
the value of the pass last year and
surprised the Army by laying down
a pigskin barrage. In one of the
workouts, a total of three passes
was attempted in scrimmage and
they resulted in three touchdowns
for a perfect score.

High spirit and Mardi Gras at-
mosphere surround the playing
field, and although some of the
quips are of the over-ripe and ham-
my variety, some are really ‘good
enough to mention. Thisone hap-
pened at tackling practice. One of
the tackles, passing a, group of

ball have been in order during the.

In a startling speech before the
members of the American Chemi-
cal Society, in New Orleans, last
week, Dr. E. R. Weidlein, director
of the Mellon Institute, declared
that research laboratories are fill-
ed with new and secret inventions
that will pull America from the
depression. He immediately came
to the point by stating that those
organizations not making use of
the depression to get rid of the
poor plants, processes, machines,
products and personnel are doom-
P The depression was caused by
attempting to operate a twenti-
eth century economic machine on

Pitkin Club Discusses
Famed Chinese Teacher

The Pitkin Club, a religious or-

ganization of the University. had

a discussion at the last meeting
on Kadawa, the great Chinese set-
tlement worker, who has taught
Christianity to his own people.
The topic for today will be,
“What is Right and Wrong?" The
club will hold an election of offi-
cers at the next meeting, as James
McAfee, Mines ’32, has found. it
necessary to resign from the of-
fice of president. The present offi-
cers are: Franklin Yellig, Mines
'32, vice-president; Eleanor Smith,
Ed. ’33, secretary, and Arthur
Charlesworth, Col. '33, treasurer.

Physics Club to Inspect
Observatory ‘Tomorrow

 

The Physics Club of the Univer-
sity, will make an inspection of the
Allegheny Observatory tomorrow
night, under the guidance of C. W.
Hetzler of the observatory staff.
The party making the trip will
meet promptly at 7:20 o’clock at
Thaw Hall.

All students interested in the
visit to the observatory, and who
have not been approached direct-
ly by a member of the Physics
Club, are invited to attend. Trans-
portation will be furnished for as
many as possible, and those having
automobiles are urged to bring
them.

guardls (football) yodels, “Hey
youse guys, youse ran against that
poor dummy for the last time right
now. It won’t be here after we get
done wid it.” “Quite right, quite
right,” fifes one of the guards (still
football), “we're likely to find it
tomorrow down at your house with
you practicing how to tackle on
it.”

shown by the players, and their
easy assimilation of instructions,
spring training is more than likely
to be cut shorter than usual.

the basis of an eighteenth century
economic philosophy, and it will be
cured as soon as science has ad-
vanced the use of our daily lives
up to the level of our economics,
Dr. Weidleln stated. In his talk, he
pointed out how science has gone
to work in industries. *

He stated that if he were permit-
ted to reveal the activities of the
various industrialists in this coun-
try_ their competitors would have
much more to worry about.

It is his belief that these times
call for original thinking, for dar-
ing and adventurous action, and,
that there are about thirty thous-
and scientists in the United States
who are doing just that.

Spring Events Carded
By Pre-Med Fraternity

At their regular monthly meeting
last Thursday evening, the mem-
bers of ‘Chi Rho Nu, honorary pre-
medical fraternity, set the dates
for activities of the society for the
remainder of the semester.

The club’s anunal trip through
the Medical School will be taken
on Monday evening, April 18, at 8
o’clock. On Thursday afternoon,
April 14, a conducted tour will be
taken through Mayview. A trip
through the Meadow Gold Dairy
laboratories will be made soon.

On Tuesday evening, April 12, a
rushing smoker will be held at the
Sigma Pi fraternity apartment,
Bellefield Dwellings. Chi Rho Nu
will ‘tap along with the other cam-
pus honorary fraternities on the
Spring Tap Day, Friday, April 29.
Initiation ceremony and banquet
will be held during the Week or
May 2.

 

Downtowners Nominate »
Four in Quiet Meeting

 

The usual political furore expect-
ed at the nominations meeting of
the Downtown Students’ Associa-
tion, Monday evening, failed to
materialize. Only one complete list
of candidates for the four student
offices of the association, was
placed in the field. Although mem-
bers had until last evening to post
petitions for election, none were
expected to be filed. '

In case no further petitions are
announced, a general meeting of
the association will. be called by
Chairman William Workmaster,

Monday evening, April 11, at which

time he will instruct that a ballot
be cast for the nominees.

The following have been nom-
inated for offices of the association
for the 1932-33 terms: Charles E.
Walker, president; Thomas W.

Gormley, vice president; Alfretta
MacAll0nan, secretary and Gerald
0’Brien, treasurer.

COLLEGES

Duck Milking

“Go Milk a Duck," a gem of
“slanguage” was born and nursed
on the U. of Vanderbilt campus.
The school is also given credit for
a peculiar three-letter word, “suli"
which is reputed to mean “sweet
young thing."

“Corsages Dear.

Appropriate corsages for the
various typeseof costumes will be
shown” in a Flower Fashion prom-
enade at Penn State. The boys at
State must have more money than
most men on the Pitt campus.

Not Yet

Governor Albert C. Ritchie, of
Maryland, wet candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion, in an interview with the
Michigan Daily, concerning drink-
ing by college students, said, "The
situation cannot be too bad, for I
have been in Ann Arbor for an
hour and a half and have not
found a drink yet.”

Coed Kiss

Quotes an Ohio Northern colum-
nist, “Does it startle you‘ to be in-
formed that the coed kiss of today
is composed of about fifty percent
lipstick, twenty-five percent gin,
fifteen percent saliva, and ten per-
cent residue, nothing else than blub-
bering,drol1ed affection.”

Fraternity Grave

Cumberland U. has 8. graveyard
in which are buried the memories
of fifteen chapters of Greek letter
fraternities. Well, we have seen
some campuses where the things
are buried alive.

lege student from the charge that
he is interested only in football and

some of his political and economic

Scenic Wonder

Men at Cambridge are wearing

kinds of scenery. Heather mixtures
for the Scottish moors, emerald
shades for the Lakes of Killarney
and orange effects for Ulster are
the most popular. Think of wear-
ing a suit to match the billboards
while motoring.

Love Hanged

Men students at the U. of Ore-
gon declared by a straw vote that
they would marry a woman 60
years old if she had a mllion dol-
lars. The coeds also maintained
that they, too," would marry for
money, and love be hanged.

Oklahoma U. has banned slang.
Use of -it in classes is to be report-

Active Friends Now Rivals
For W. S. G. A. Presidency

av GLADYS PYLE>

Once in a while the best of
friends become rivals whether they
want to or not—so Rose Marie
Demestichas, Col. '33, and Ruth
Hamilton, Ed. '33, discovered when
they were nominated as the two
candidates for the presidency of
Woman's Self Government Associ-
ation. After three years of close as-
sociation in W. S. G. A. ‘and other
organizations they rival each other
next week ill the true spirit of
“friendly enemies.”

Both have worked with W. S. G.

representatives of other organiza-
tions, chairmen of committees and
this year as’ major officers of the
organization. Through their close
contact with W. S. G. A., they

Letters

To the Editor of the Pitt Week-
ly:
It is my, belief that the

Campus Poll as conducted by
the Pitt Weekly on Friday,
April 1, will not only fail to
bring to light the ‘students’
favorite presidential aspirants," ‘
but will also fail to give a “fair
cross-section of student opin-
ion."

For I am confident that there
is a growing number of students
swinging to the Socialist and
Communist poiilts of view. I
am disgusted with the capital-
ist Republican-Democratic Par-
ty. I want a society that will
produce not for proﬁt but for
use—-—a society that will give
every man the opportunity to
work for a living wage—-—a so-

yciety in which the workers and
masses will receive justice.

The Republican-Democratic par-
ty is not even aimed in that‘.
direction. 
~ As the Nation has remarked, ,
it would be entirely legal if the‘
citizens of the United States
should elect to the high office
of President an honest, intelli-
gent man or woman» who be-
longed to neither the Republi-
can nor the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, such a. President
would be violating no law if
his chief interest lay not in re-
election but in honest govern-
ment and the cure and preven-
tion of depression without re-
gard to political expediency.

Therefore, I ask for 3. Cam-
pus Poll that will give a “fair
cross-section of student opin-
ion" in fact. Those of us who
do "not vote Republican-Demo
crat will be relatively few, but
I do believe the number will be
signiﬁcant enough to give my
statement validity. The ques-
tion of free speech is obviously
involved. Give us an oppor.
tunity to vote with the rest
of you. ,

Sincerely yours,

FRANK  ,

to how the ideals of the organiza-
tion might be most successfully
carried on.

“I hope that I may do my part,”
says Roe iMarie Demestichas, “to
make the Woman's Self Govern-
ment Association instrumental in
getting the women of Pitt to work
together and to bring about a clos-
er unity among themselves. I'hope,
too, that the relationship between
the various parts of the organiza-

stood by those who take part in
them. This, I believe, must be done

through extensive work with the
individual committees first, and
then a greater coordination of the
several parts into one.”

Ruth Hamilton is of the opinion
that “W. S. G. A., should be a vital
part in the life of every woman stu-
dent at Pitt. “I shall endeavor to
reach every student by fully devel-
oping the various branches of the
activities of W. ‘S. G. A. I think,
too, that it is important to bring
together into closer cooperation
with W. S. G. A., the other major
organizations.”

Both girls have been outstanding
in activities throughout their three
years at Pitt. Rose Marie Demes-
tichas is at present the secretary
of W. S. G. A., junior representa-
tive to Student Council and junior
.advisor to Cwens. Last year she
was president of Cwens, chairman
of the hostess committee, and a.
member of Customs Committee.
As a freshman Miss Demestichas
was a member of the Weekly staff.
She was awarded the Panhellenic
scholarship last year on the basis
of scholarship, personality, “and
leadership in activities. She is a
member of Meda, Quill and Honor-
ary Ushers.

Ruth Hamilton is at present
treasurer of W. S. G. A., and ac-
tive Panhellenic representative for
‘Zeta Tau Alpha sorority, and a
member of Panhellenic Ball ‘Com-
mittee. She recently served on the
Junior Prom Committee.‘ Last year
she was chairman of the Customs
Committee, a- Cwen and a member
of Glee Club. As a freshman she
was social chairman of her class.
She is also an Honorary Usher.

behind their names, there is no
doubt as to the capabilities of these
two women to fill the office for
which they have been chosen.

STUDY SCHOLASTIC RATING. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS

A recommendation will be placed
in the hands of the Engineering
Alumni Association enlisting the
aid of graduate engineers to plan
for the future development of the
Schools of Enginering and Mines
of the University. The project will
be the result of a survey now be-
ing carried on by the____executive

ct‘?

committee of the association. It
will be made to the association at

its annual luncheon meeting in the
William Penn Hotel, the first week
in June.

According to the investigating
committee, the survey and recom-
mendation results from complaints
received during the past year from
graduate engineers and others.’ It
is the general belief that scholas-
tic rating and entrance qualifica-
tions of enginers at the University
are not sufficiently high, and engi-
neering units are too isolated.

in England and Germany in 1914,
according to Dr Eddy, who has
just returned from a six-month tour
of Japan and China.

The Chinese government, which
is at present virtually bankrupt,
cannot continue in power much
longer, be said. Should it fall, com-
munism, now ﬁrmly rooted in many
parts of China, would supplant it,
and the dominion of the U. S. S.
R. would stretch to the shores of
the China Sea. With China under
communism, Japan would be at lib-
erty to help itself to any ‘Chinese or
Manchurian land desired.

Likewise the German govern-
ment is straining under the terriﬁc
burden of war reparations. Unless
the disarmament -conference‘ now
in session moves to relieve the sit-
uation, the Hindenberg regime may
terminate and communism come in-
to power, creating a 6,000 mile
stretcliof communism, from the
Yellow Sea to within 75 miles of
Paris, stated Dr. Eddy.

As France could not conceivably

and as Russia would move to pre-
vent any constriction of the growth
of communism, ‘a nucleus for a
world conﬂict would be provided.

Dr. Eddy suggeiited three meas-
ures to preserve world peace: ﬂrst
the fostering of public opinion
agsinse national unethical and dan-
gerous practices; second, the bring-
ing to bear a political pressure up-
on nations guilty of disturbing the
peace of the world; and third, the
economic boycotting of such na-
tion-s. Only by taking ‘such steps
can the world be saived from the ca-
tastrophe that lies before

Inameetlng of the thirteen mem-

president of the association, held
recently with Chancellor John G.
Bowman, this matter was discussed
It was suggested that the Universi-

of freshmen entering the engineer-
ing schools, to include a four-year
high school course of mathematics,
and compulsory courses in physics
and chemistry. By this means, it
was suggested, freshmen not only
will be better qualified, but there
will be less danger of freshman
failures. Dr.'Bowman agreed with
the committeessuggestions and as

‘‘It is the idea of the committee
