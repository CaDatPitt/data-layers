BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Oakland's Little Italy community

under the Schenley Bridge in .
Panther Hollow is facing the
problems of pollution by the

surrounding population, commun-
ity decay and lack of new‘
investment in the area, according
to local residents. 4

This ethnic community, apart
from the noise and congestion of
has
resisted the changes which have
left many of the other regions
within Pittsburghdirtier and less
livable.

According to _1920’s newspaper
accounts, the Boundary Street area
was a self-sufficient community in
the midst of the city, with its own
grocery store, steam-shipping a-
gency,“barber shop and bank, an
“island” in Pittsburgh’s industrial
roar.

But now the Boundary Street
area has become a dumping ground
for the Oakland District, and the
people around Little Italy are not
happy with the results. A

Dan Pasquarelli, a landowner in
the area, ‘said Boundary Street
community wanted action on this
problem, and the residents wanted
to preserve the atmosphere of
pastoral detachment.

“We like this place,” Pasquar-
elli said, “There is a togetherness
here." A tour conducted by
Pasquarelli of the area for an
_ecology class under the direction of
Dr. - Arcadi Nebolsine, revealed
widespread dumping of waste and
wreckage in the area. -

“This isn’t done by the
residents," Pasquarelli said, “It is
people from outside. To stop it
you'd «need twenty-four-hour
guards."

According to Pasquarelli, there
has not been any considerable
building since the ‘twenties, and
many homes which were torn down
over the years have not been
replaced.

The University owns some land
in the area, including two homes, a
parking lot, and an empty lot. One
of the Pitt-owned homes is vacant.

“One of these homes was a
much-needed grocery store before
the University bought it," Pas-
quarelli said.

Pitt made agreements with the

community over the amount of
recreational greenspace to be
developed from University-leased
land. Pasquarelli said the
negotiations were difficult, but
they proved satisfactory.

"-We'd rather talk with the
University than the B&O Railroad.
That’s who ‘-the University is
leasing the land from,” Pasquarelli
said.

Many of the families who live in
the Boundary Street area have
owned land in there for many
years, passing the property from
generation to generation.

Recently absentee ownership has
become more prevalent as the
families spread out from the Little
Italy community and spread
through Pittsburgh.

Pasquarelli, remarking on the
proposed Oakland Crosstown Ex-
pressway which would utilize the
railroad right of ways through Little
Italy, said he would prefer the
trains to cars on a highway.

“We used to have the old steam
trains through here‘ and they
caused quite a bit of smoke and
noise, but it wasn't damaging to
the environment, even the diesels
weren't so bad. But a highway,
that would mean a constant noise,”

the land owner said.

Nebolsine said the University
had taken a positive approach to
the problems of the area, and he

saw a clean-up program as a partial -

solution to the environmental mess
in some parts of the Boundary
Street area. _ -
“The class is very enthusiastic
about a clean-up,” Nebolsine said,

Delivery Strike Continues,-

BY BILL HADUCK
Pittsburgh was without its two
ma_jor newspapers for the eighth
straight day yesterday as delivery
truck drivers continued their strike
against the Pittsburgh Press and

:the Post-Gazette.

‘ Although a federalmediator met
with both sides earlier in the week,
negotiations failed to bring about a
resolution and the Post-Gazette
was forced to lay off half its
editorial staff according to an
Associated Press report.

“Unofﬁcially, they only. have
about three editorial staffers left,"
said a spokesman at the Press/
Post-Gazette offices.

The strike began March 30 as
Teamsters Local 211 walked off
their jobs in a dispute over length

of contract, wages, fringe benefits, r

loading operations, car allowances,
and holiday work. The old contract
expired December 31 of last year.
Meanwhile, a Monroeville week-
ly will begin daily publication
Monday, in an effort to fill the void
left by the‘ Teamsters? strike.

Buck Nationwide Trend A

BY CALRITCHEY

A nation-wide shortage of
students which has forced some
colleges to begin radical recruiting
methods hasn't seriously affected
Pitt, according to Edmund C.
Harper, Freshmen Admissions

. Officer.

“It’s a complicated business but
I don’t think we’ve changed
basically,” Harper said. “For
instance, we’re still visiting the
high schools. I think we reach
every high school in Penssylvania
in some manner, either through our
recruiters or via our regional

: campuses.” .
’ Recent stories in national publi-

cations have emphasized the

E financial plight of many American
colleges. Some colleges faced with

total collapse have begun using

; direct mail recruiting, radio spot

commercials and curriculum re-
structuring in order to attract
enough students to keep their

. classrooms filled, the publications

said.

“We have done some new
things,” Harper said. “We
recently had a program in
Monroeville where we invited
students who have been admitted
to the freshman class this year --
and their parents -- to hear.-some of
our current students speak about
the college. This was a
pilot-pro_iect kind of arrangement
and we’ve had some good
comments on it.”

Faculty members have been
asked to write letters to freshmen
admitted to their respective
schools. In the math department,
Professor Henry Cohen “has called

‘ almost all" of the 95 new students

in the department, Harper said.

Bernstein and Woodward

The idea is to give the new students I

an opportunity to talk to a faculty
member in the particular school _

before classes begin, Harper said. V

“The faculty has_gotten into this
thing pretty well,” he reported.

Pitt has also awarded seven
Chancellor’s Scholarships this’
year, the admissions officer said.
These scholarships, new last year,
are for $3,100 per year, and can be
awarded in each of the four years
during which an undergraduate
will attend the college. A

“The Chancellor’s Scholarship is . ‘

offered only to extremely well-

qualiﬁed students based on their -

academic performance in high
school, and on their "college board
scores,” Harper noted.

“Pitt is in pretty good shape,”
Harper said. “The number of
incoming freshmen is up from last
year, particularly in the engineer-
ing department. Engineering has
their own full-time recruiter.
Nursing is also up; Arts and
Sciences are about the same as last _-
year. ' .

“We should be able to meet the
quota for the respective schools
without any problem,” Harper
concluded.

Pitt's Registration Supervisor,
[Barry Smith agreed with. Harper i
about the status of Pitt enrollment.
Although registrations for next fall V
declined by 65 students the number
is not significant, Smith said.

“It’s really too early to tell what

the fall registrations will look like,” ‘ V

Smith said. “Students who are

now registered can later decide to r

drop out completely, and some
students may wait until the last
moment to register. The bills will

Post Reporters Reveal Inside Source

NEW YORK AP--Two Wash-

together major Watergate stories
say that Hugh W. Sloan Jr.,
onetime treasurer of President
Nixon's re-election committee, was
a major source of information for
them. '

all of which was done by Bernstein
and Woodward. Many of the
Post’s stories were developed by
persevering on leads bypassed by
government investigators and
other newsmen, the articles say,
but crucial confirmation often came
from a handful of sources including
Sloan.

In a parenthetical aside, the

authors note that Sloan was never

identified as a source in Post
stories, but that he has now agreed
to allow the disclosure of his name.
Sloan declined on Sunday ‘ to

Woodward and Bernstein

Reveal Inside Source  

(Continued from Page 1)
spokeswoman for Playboy said the
magazine paid $30,000 for the right
to excerpt 25,000 words, or about a
quarter of the total.

It was from Sloan, former
treasurer of the Finance Committee
to Re-elect the President, that
Woodward and Bernstein said they
first learned the names of several
key controllers of a secret GOP
fund for financing campaign
activities against the Democrats.

The article also describes a
number of clandestine meetings
between Woodward and a member
of the executive branch, not
identified by name but dubbed
“Deep Throat.”

“Deep Throat” had access to
information at the White House,
Justice, the FBI and reelection
committee, the article says. “The
man’s position in the executive

branch was extremely sensitive.”u
If Woodward wished to set up a

meeting with “Deep Throat,”

according to the article, he would

move a flowerpot containing a red
flag to the rear of his balcony.

If his contact wanted a meeting,
he would circle a number on page
20 of Wood'ward’s home-delivered
copy of the New York Times and
draw clock hands to designate the
time. Woodward did not know how
“Deep Throat”got to his paper,
the article said. I

Woodward had known “Deep
Throat" since long before Water-
gate. The reporter said of his
source: “Deep Throat never tried

' to inﬂate his knowledge...He was,

incongruously, an incurable gossip,
careful to label rumor for what it
was, but fascinated by it.”

At one of their sessions, “Deep
Throat” described to Woodward
President Nixon’s outraged reac-
tion. to news leaks about Water-
gate. ' ’

“Nixon was wild, shouting and
hollering that, ‘We can’t have it
and we're going to stop it. ‘I don't
care how much it costs.”',

Woodward also asked
“Deep Throat” about President
Nixon’s decision to submit L.

Patrick Gray’s name to the Senate
for confirmation as J. Edgar
Hoover’s successor as FBI director.

“Deep Throat” replied:

“In early February, Gray went to
the White House and said in effect,
‘I’m taking the rap on Watergate.’
He got very angry and said he had
done- his iob and contained the
investigation judiciously, that it
wasn’t fair that he was being
singled out to take the beat. He
implied that all hell could break
loose if he wasn't able to stay on
the job permanently and keep the
lid on.-

“Nixon could have thought this
was a threat, though Gray is not
that sort of guy. Whatever the
reason, the President agreed in a
hurry and sent Gray’s name up to
the Senate right away...”

Concerning the govemment’s
probe, Bernstein and Woodward
wrote: “In the biggest, most
wide-ranging investigation since
the assassination of President
Kennedy, the FBI didn’t. even call
the numbers found in the ,Water-
gate defendants’ address books.

One night “Deep Throat” told’

Woodward about the intelligence
gathering activities of the Com-
mittee to Re-elect the President:

“...A lot of the intelligence
gathering was routine. They are
not brilliant guys, but it gotout of
hand. That is the key phrase, the
feeling that it all got out of
hand...Much of the intelligence
gathering was on their own

campaign contributors...”

Summing up the Watergate
affair, “Deep Throat” was quoted
by Bernstein and Woodward as
saying it began in 1969 with “the
first targets of -aggressive wiretap-
ping...the reporters and those in
the administration who were
suspected of disloyalty.

“Then the emphasis was shifted
to the radical political opposition
during the antiwar protests. When
itgot near election time, it was only

natural to tap the Democrats,"-

they quoted him as saying.

Checkpoint counter in the central ground floor lobby of the Cathedral of
Learning. If the invoice transaction is simple there will be a mailbox there.
If the bill, aid/loan certificates and checks equal the amount due on the

» invoice it can be put in anenvelope and deposited, provided the student
is sure about his bill, documents, or check. No cash in the mailbox,
please. These will be processed and paid copies/validation certificates
back in the mail to students within 48 hours, provided the student fur-

I nishes a sélf-addressed stamped envelope with the correct return address.

In an effort to save time for our student customers, we are testing a new
invoice payment systemlthis term. The University wants to keep the lines
short, save timefor students with simple transactions, and give expert
direction to students with problems. There will still have to be thousands
'5. of transactions processed during the first due date of the term, but with
a little cooperative effort we will be able to better serve the students.

As you can see from the diagram, we would like to have incoming stu-
dents use the Forbes and Bellefield entrances on April 9, 10 and 11. All

students should go directly to the Student Accounting Information) All students must go through the information counter whereafast check

of documents will separate quick cashier transactions from students with
questions or problems. Invoices will be stamped here and cashiers will
accept transactions only from students okayed for quick payment. This
should speed up service for all by getting students to the right office

SGB: A Leadership Vacuum WPGH '°'a“5

Athletic Director Cas Myslinski has
indicated he will not fund the
Hockey Club, even though it is a
team sport. All this comes after the
University's attempt to charge
students for time schedules.

Chancellor Posvar has indicated
any increse in state subsidy will be
spent on faculty salary increases.
Meanwhile, worthwhile community
services and essential student
services are being cut back, /as
members of the Student Govern-
ment Board worry about the sex
discrimination provisions of the
CS0 by-laws.

This year the Board should strive
to achieve one important goal at
least. It must force the University
administration to redeﬁne its role
in the community, and particularly
its responsibilities to students. The
administration must state clearly
its obligations relating to funding
and providing services. '

According to former Board

members the University refuses..to..l

deal with the elected student
representatives from September to
the end of their term in ofﬁce. The
administration prefers, instead, to
delay until a new and -less
experienced SGB assumes ofﬁce.

Help cso!

Dear Editor,
Help!!!
We were anxious to get involved.
We wanted to do our part for the
dynamic “new" Student Govern-
ment Board which had promised to

~ “open the windows and let in some

fresh air and new ideas.” Perhaps
we were too idealistic.
We eagerly applied for positions
on. the Committee on Student
Organizations. We were inter-

viewed, we thought, by the Student

' Government Board and were told to

wait patiently for the appointment
announcements which were to
follow. '

We waited,— patiently.
waited, endlessly. We all but gave
up. We ﬁgured that our dynamic
“new” Student Government Board
had “opened the windows” a little
to indiscriminantly. We envisioned
our precious applications being
silently carried out of the Student
Union on the breast of a balmy
spring breeze. We mourned.

Apparently concerned with our
welfare, the Pitt News graciously
conducted an investigation into the
matter and uncovered a “list” of
CS0 appointments. The “list” was
published in a Hockey Club article
on March 29. Perhaps, we
thought, all was not lost after all.
We became optimistic. _We
thought the SG Board would
shortly inform us ofﬁcially of our
appointments so the Committee
could get underway. Once again
we waited, patiently. Once again
we waited, endlessly.

Finally, in the April 5th edition
of the Pitt News we discovered
another announcement pertaining
to the recently appointed [?] CSO.
This time the information was
cleverly hidden in an article about
the SG Allocations Committee.
Included was the date which had
been set for our first meeting, and
the proposed ‘agenda for this
meeting. Of course, we greatly
appreciate the Pitt News’ continu-
ing interest in the plight of the CS0

 

We

As long as Furick devotes the
spring to the allocations process he
will not be prepared to negotiate
with the administration until
September.
must begin immediately, and
Furick must bear the responsibility

’ of directing SG’s efforts at forcing
‘Pitt to redeﬁne its committments

and meet its responsibilities.

In addition, the SGB cannot
devote its attention to only one
problem at a time‘. Too much needs
to be accomplished. Afterall, there
are seven members of the Board.

Unfortunately, the majority of
the Board is not accepting the
responsibilities of their ofﬁces.
Only Pat Kablach and Bruce Keeler
have attempted to supply 'Student
Government“ with the leadership
necessary to function. They have
distinguished themselves as hard

workers dedicated to the needs of 1

their student constituents. .
The other members of the Board
are inexperienced and need guid-
ance and leadership from the
president. Furick must encourage
Board members to accept their
responsibilities. But, ‘this takes
leadership and direction, which
Mike Furick is not providing.

[?]. ' At least somebody cares.

Nevertheless, we are still quite
puzzled’ over the entire matter.
Hadn’t we been interviewed by the
SG Board and not the Pitt News?
Must students depend on the Pitt
News for notiﬁcation “of appoint-
ment to Student Government
committees? Must we always refer
to the Friday editions of the Pitt
News for announcements of our
scheduled meetings? Is Brian
Dunn now responsible ‘for setting
our agenda? Who knows? Who
can help? ’

It has been" said that “that
government is- best shich governs
least,”but this is ridiculous!!!-

to go through to try to get the pitt

some changes that have been made

there was sufﬁcient time to get the

student population know, but now,
we are drawing very close to ﬁnals

that it takes for information to
disseminate on this campus, I feel
that you have let things go for too
long. It is hard for me to believe

WPGH has been functioning at
the University for 15 years as a
carrier current AM station.
Recently, the station has made a
large progressive drive to become a
licensed FM station broadcasting
on an educational frequency.

Although the cost factors might
seem extravagant, the beneﬁts to
the University community easily
. outweigh any and all ﬁnancial

considerations.

The two immediate benefits that
come to mind are the biggest
factors in WPGH’s drive to go FM.
They are a wider listening range
and a better signal.

The wider range is a great
necessity to a university such as
Pitt. It affords the commuters, as
well as the dorm students and off
campus students a chance to hear a
station speciﬁcally geared to their
interests. This larger listening».
audience also helps the university
create a favorable and hopefully
impressive effect on the general
population of Pittsburgh.

In the past one of the problems

is easily seen, a letter which merely

will more than likely never be

Black Studies

The Editor,

While recognizing Professor
Porter’s right to his own views and
wary of the face that this is not the
most propitious time to open
another debate on Black Studies, I
must, nonetheless, publicly disas-
sociate myself from the views
expressed in his article (letter) in

Pitt News April 3, 1974.

Sincerely,
Richard Blackett

' phere,

encountered with the AM Broad-
casting Signal was the students’
complaints of weak reception.
Since the site for the transmitter
and the antenna will be on top of
the Cathedral, WPGH will be
afforded one of the highest points
in the city. A strong signal of
several miles radius from the
Cathedral will be received by a
majority of students.

The long range beneﬁts are
perhaps the key reasons why the
station should become an FM
Licensed Broadcaster. Students
would be better informed about the
University, its programs, activities,
and news. .

Some of the public affairs
programming plans already in the
works should WPGH become an
FM station are: The broadcasting
of events which are sold out or
events, which for some reason a
majority of the students cannot
attend, a listing of all class
cancellations for the day, which
would be aired several‘ times dailyf
a trafﬁc watch in which the

commuters, themselves, would .

participate, free listing and meet-
ing announcements for University
organizations, and of course,
campus news the minute it
happens. '

Another advantage to the stu-
dents is it gives people aichance to
perform in a professional atmos-
preparing them for a
possible future career.

/Plans to help the station achieve
this professionalism are currently
being investigated. ’ ' At this time
WPGH is trying to ' secure a
consultant to help the station with
on the air duties specifically in the
area of public affairs.

Another objective is to obtain
credits for a course designed
particularly for station members
which would utilize their know-
ledge and expertise in a learning
environment to become a skilled
individual broadcaster. . \

Creating more interest among
students for/WPGH and the entire
University is the primary objective
in going FM. Not only will this
create an awareness of the
University in the general Pitts-
burgh communityfbut more
importantly it will provide a vital
channel of communication among
the students at Pitt.

J azz Pianist

BY HEDDY M. RICHARD, III ..

Those who have the good fortiiiie
of meeting Mwandishi (Herbie
Hancock) know he is paradoxically
serious and light hearted, dedi-
cated to and healthily detached
from the music he plays and
composes. , His coming perfor-
mance sponsored by the BAS is
Wednesday April 10, 8 pm at the
Syria Mosque. 

There is such a thing as classic
jazz. It happened between 1956,
[by which time bebop licks were
firmly entrenched that no one
even thought about it any more]
and 1965 when the “new thing”
became “respectable” through the
John Coltrane-Archie Shepp-Pha-
roah Sanders axis.

Looking back on that time, it is
clear it was a classic era, and the
latter part of that period resulted in
Herbie Hancock, who was then
recognized as a classic interpreter
of the mood of the times and
continues to lead today in an even
more spectacular fashion.

Hancock's earliest recordings as

a leader were done while he was a

member of the classic Miles Davis
Quintet; Hancock on piano, Wayne
Shorter on sax, Tony Williams on

. drums, and Ron Carter on bass. A

close examination of today’s status
of these gentlemen would enable
any good observer to see why this
group was considered the greatest
jazz group ever put together..
Hancock is acknowledged to be

one of the bigger draws among jazz-

musicians and his records have
long ago attained respectable sales
ﬁgures. Hancock is‘ an eminent
keyboard stylist as well as being a
highly proliﬁc writer whose work
has been inﬂuenced by such
divergent influences as James
Brown and the little-known early
20th century French composer Lili
Boulanger.

His credits include “Watermelon
Man,” which was latinized into the
top 10 in 1963 by Mongo
Santamaria about which he told an

interviewer of Downbeat magazine,

“When I composed “Watermelon

Man," I think some of the same
elements were there. But I wrote
that 12 years ago, when I was 22.
In 1962, both this country and my
frame of mind were different.”

The music of Herbie Hancock
touches just the right level of
serenity and madness that the age
dictates. It is ethereal without
sinking into drowsiness it has the
electronic charge without becoming
a slave to machinery.

Herbie Hancock possesses those
same qualities that made Miles
Davis recognize him as a young
genius when Hancock was twenty.
He has a brilliant improvisational
technique, a vivid imagination, a
solid understanding of who he Is,
what he is doing, and why he is
doing it, and also the intelligence
and ability to take advantage of his
position as one of the very best.

All these convolutions vanish,
however, when listening to Han-
cock. The music is right and you
can feel it in your bones, no matter

 

how it may vary from-the norm.
This has to do with the technical
skills of the musicians, which is
considerable, their facility at
listening to each other and the
intelligence of Hancock himself.

It is music from emotions below
the surface, but not merely the
bleats and honks of outrage. If you
would like to hear what is
sometimes called “The New Jazz"
as painlessly as possible, Hancock
is the man.

entertainers. l’m not sure what it
is, but I really like the name, I
wrote this for someone very special
to me because I think she deserves
the golden globe award.” In the

song, he explains that this friend
deserves said award because
“those golden globes of yours are
so fine.” He sings,‘ “Ah, those

medium of words. F. Scott
Fitzgerald was_ a novelist, not a
screenwriter, even when he tried.

He wrote The Great Gtsby as a
novel, ‘using words to describe
images that’ people could only

imagine through the words.

All this’ seems rather obvious,

right? .. A novel is a novel", not a .

movie. And just because a story
works beautifully in one medium
doesn't mean that it will work in
another. Quite the opposite. ~You
can't seperate the medium from its_
“message,"--its story. ilt was not
simply the plot behind the words
which made The Great Gatsby such
a monumental novel, but the words
that structured it. .

When will the Hollywood moguls
learn such an obvious fact? , Really
good novels simply do not make
good movies. What usually
happens in" the attempt isieither:
one, the action of along novel,
ﬁlled with subplots, is rushed and
hastily edited, leaving aconfusing
story that cannot be understood
without the book, like The
Godfather;’two, the movie discards

everything but what the producer‘
G discerns as. “the essence,

and
creates a new story from there, like
Charly; or three, the film tries as
hard as possible to reproduce

exactly what the producers think‘.

narrow, stifled, English teacher's
interpretation like Catch-22.

Gatsby falls into this third

category, with the added problem "

of narration .,fromj Fitzgerald's
novel. The words are- richly

descriptive, but are a cheap crutch .

for what should be a movie. But try
as it will, The Great Gatsby is not a
ﬁlm, but rather what the camera
sees as one interpretation of the
book.

In this case the camera sees
mainly a love story of a mysterious

man and the woman he has
pursued for years, with a sketchy
background of the decadent ’20s.
As to detail, the film is faithful
down to the colors and styles of the
clothes Fitzgerald described. But
altogether Gatsby lacks the power

I and passion of the novel Fitzgerald

wrote about morally hollow people,
ﬂoating aimlessly and destructively
through a turbulent era.

The book dealt with a man who
had no identity but a mindless
obsession for one woman, and the
lack of real--although loudly
professed-love in any of the
characters, even the nameless
‘masses who throngedeto Gatsby’s
parties. And that’s just another

not much. It is needlessly wordy,
again using the narration to say
what the camera should. And the

becoming bogged down with subtle

‘Peaceable Kingdom’ . /

An Album On Canvas

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD
;Peaceable.Kingdom (Pd 6023), Rob
Carlson and Jon Gailmor.

Some prophet’s fantasy about the
lamb and the lion resting together

' has been transformed and dreamed

about and metaphorised and
simile-ed more than most visions
you can realize. Somewhere a
decade or so ago a Quaker preacher
set his own interpretation to

'canvas in a series of one hundred

paintings and called it “Peaceable
Ki-ndom." ,

Two guys that have been working
with each other for three’ years,
with interruptions from school and
what-not, have brought us a most
tempting album with the same
title...there is a Santa Claus--he
has brought us his LP from
Polydor by Rob Carlson and Jon

’ Gailmor.

Both men sing, and quite well,
and play guitar, and quite nicely.
Their music is part of the new‘
Underground I believe has erupted
from the “gag” rock, “Glitter”
rock, tight pants and make-up rock,
of the past few years. What has
happened is that performers are
doing more by themselves rather
than being in the larger band
scene. Not that the rhythm backing
them up is discrediting, but the top
artist[s] have the primary _iob...
writing, playing or singing.

stands out
song...good at writing but yet,

— It’s extremely difficult to get away

from the comparison game--mak-
ing the artist sound like someone
else. But it may be helpful at the
beginning of the career to give ’em
a push by saying they sound like
Loggins and Messina or Seals and
Crofts at times. That's good for
awhile, but remember they sound
like Carlson and Gailmor more that
anybody else.

Their songs tell stories. Like most
of my underground category artists
they are concerned with lyrical
content harmonizing with the
musical content." And like most of
the new breed of singer/song-
writers the poetry of the song
like a sore green

distinctive. _

The title track “Peaceable King-
dom” is the epitome of storytelling
tunes and quality verses.
Beginning with an a‘capella har-
monizing and moving into the
instrumentation. It depicts the
idea the preacher/painter had and
how he possibly transformed it onto
the the canvas.

' Softness dominates the album
with acoustic guitar blended with
strings and precise harmonies by
the duo. Tunes like “Annie” that
say..“you cannot tap the feelings
of another without revealing

something, of your own" and
“Gardener Illinois” (pronounced

XMAS Gift Called ‘Kingdom’

(Continued from Page 6)

Illl eh noy for all you from the hills)
which speak “...quicksilver sun-
light illuminates my tintype” are
the archetype for mellow music.
“Ridin’ To nantucket” has a
continuing image of the old salty
New England adventurous sailor
that these gentlemen have in their
tunes. “Thank the Island" is
another of these seaside songs that
instill in you a peaceful easy feeling
and serenity of the music.

The album isn’t all down. The
driving work of the bassman puts
all their tunes in an up tempo but
two particular songs “Tupelo” and

“[Broke Down] Showboar” are real‘

rockers. The first makes you get up
and dance in a honky-tonk sort of
way with a trumpet solo playing the
major role and the second about the
river life with “saints and sinners
picking guitar.” Both have the
energy of a true rocking tune.
My favorite is “Slow Down

Rob Carlson and'Jon Gailmor are outwith an album, Peaceable

(Continued from Page 6)
cannot seem aristocratic in the
least. Redford looks more beautiful
than mysterious, and only rarely
shows the eternal passion that he
feels for Daisy. Farrow seems to
look the part, acting appropriately
giddy and spoiled, but it’s
impossible to figure out why
Gatsby is so enthralled. And Sam
Waterson, as the narrator Nick,
does little more than narrate.

The best performance is by Karen ‘

Black as Myrtle, the “common”
but beautifully sensuous lover that
Tom picks up and throws away.
Scott Wilson, as her cuckolded
husband, is also respectable for his
small part.

The sets, mostly from Newport
mansions, are lushly breathtaking,
and the costumes will make any
fashion page. The photography is
superb in creating romantic moods,
but does not do so well in creating
the feeling of the A“roaring
twenties.”

Perhaps, when photographing the
extravagent party scenes, if direc-
tor Jack Clayton had tried a
panoramic overhead shot, pulling

back from the masses and showing
the total scene, instead of relying
on medium closeups of individual
revels, the parties would have
seemed more wild and indicative of
the social mood.
So the ﬂick is not overly rotten.

‘But if you really want to see The

Great Gatsby, read the book.

It isri’,t all the time that someone
puts out a work of art that I really
enjoy, especially in music.
Sometimes when I listen to this
album I ﬁnd myself thinking these
two have been sent to us from
another planet that hasn’t heard all

‘the crap being played in halls like

the Arena or on the radio stations
that claim to be king. I would
advise anyone who truly (and this is

"in all seriousness) would like to

hear some fresh quality music to

pick up this album. It’s on Poydor '

if you can ﬁnd it at all in this city. I
promise (sounds like William
Shatner) that you'll dig this album
from the first tune. Promise...

Gardner's ‘Nickel Mountain’

4

A Metallic Trip to the Past

BY HARRIS LEVY
NICKEL MOUNTAIN

I by John Gardner 313 pp. illustrated

New York: Alfred A. Knopf $6.95

In some quarters, Nickel Moun-.

tain will be ignored because it is

unusually and intentionally old-~

fashioned. If John Gardner had
been able to iron out the flaws in a
few tinny-sounding passages, his
latest novel would be a total
success. Even though his writing
isn't golden (in the sense that he
avoids flashiness) his simple prose
still shines. (There, that’s enough
bad puns to last you for the whole
month.)

Gardner, whose previous works
include the novels Grendel [1971]

and The Sunlight Dialogues [1972]
and the poem Jason and Medeia
[I973], has matched a simple style
with a story about common people.
By opting for simplicity, Gardner
succeeds where authors such as
John Updike(Rabbit, Run) have
failed. -
Nickel Mountain is the story of
Henry Soames. Henry runs the
Stop Off diner, situated in a rural
area iust north of Nickel Mountain;
his diner is frequented mostly by
truckers and a few local people.
Henry is obese; his doctor has
advised him to lose -90 pounds or
risk a second, possibly fatal heart
attack. A bachelor, Henry is
basically a kind person. He is also

shy and somewhat inarticulate.

Gardner supplements his clear,
functional prose with frequent
analogies. Examples: Henry's
“rolls of fat fell away like the wake
of a rowboat from his nose;” a
character is described as “playing
with sex the way" little boys play
with flares along the railroad
tracks;” a description of a man
whose wife just died: includes “his
face as white and soft as bread
dough, his mouth collapsed like the
mouth of a dime-store goldfish.”

Gardner heightens moods by
having his characters perceive
attitudes in inanimate objects.
“Go slow, said the room. Be
patient, said the trees. She could
feel with coming, a murderous
solidity, hunting her.”

Another example: “I’m serious,

I Frank,” Henry said. All the house

andithe surrounding night seemed‘
to echo his earnestness. He’s
serious.” Gardner also makes
frequent use of equivalent mood-
influencers from nature, like
sunlight and fog.

Nickel Mountain is subtitled “A
pastoral novel.” Gardner succeeds
in giving his novel an old-fashioned
feeling by his slow exposition and

without any.” The name of the
song is “Holding.”

The words are insane and inane,
proof of this being, “Now you ask
was I holdin’/I said why no I’m not
holdin’, I thought you was holdin’
it’s true/so here you're not holdin’,
you thought I was holdin’, my clear

advises, “So find out if they’re
holdin’, get down and start rollin’,
and smoke up their holdin’
instead.” Music over,. he finished
with a flourish, and deadpan,
announces a la John Wayne,
“Holding--it's the American way.”

Eliciting ‘a somewhat teary,
throat-choking sing-along response
from the people was Hartford’s
song about the removal of the Opry
from the old Ryman Auditorium.
“They’re Gonna Tear Down the
Grand "Ole Opry” echoed through
the Annex for a while after the song
had ended. Like the man said,
“Another good thing has done and

the audience yelled out the refrain
in harmony, melody, and scatter-
ings of off-key wails. But it was
Hartford who had the most fun with
the tune as he ended once, then
twice, then abondoned himself to
the song completely.

He composed himself for the
next show, including in it a song
dedicated to the Gateway Center,
whose “buildings all look like
stereo components.” He describes
a» recurrent nightmare in which
“they” cut off his hair, dress him
in a surrealist businessman’s suit,
and send him away to “work in tall
buildings.” The refrain strikes a
responsive note in the hearts of
students, “So it’s goodbye to the
sunshine, goodbye to the dew,
goodbye to the ﬂowers, and
goodbye to you.”

Hartford" has a song for the
people in his past, friends who
have taught him well. One, an
“old riverman,”
vehemently, “you say he’s old-
fashioned, well goddamn, so was
I.” And perhaps he is-, with his
peculiar but special brand of music;
bluegrass andrrock, or, as he once
mused, “grass-rock.” Billed

he defends *

misleadingly as a “guitarist V11‘-
tuoso," Hartford is much more
than a strummer of strings and a
wailer of words. He is, indeed, a
string virtuoso, delighting people
with his knowledge of guitar,
banjo, and fiddle (or, more
deservedly, the violin--Hartford's

skill and versatility. permit won-'

drous transformation of this much-
abused instrument.)

Lastly, because the group was
first [sort of like an upside down
Cathedral], there’s Redemption, a
three man group with guitar
sounds of America but lyrics
incredibly complex and almost too
heavy for singing. But somehow
the singer pulled it off, boogie/ un-
cle tomming it across the stage,
narrowly avoiding the mesmerized
bass player who hid hid face from
“music lovers”
self-parked in the Annex.

Working himself into the proper
melancholy, the singer breathed,
“this is a depressing song, oh God,
how depressing...you just don’t
know...” an interruption from the
bass man, “it’s not that song!”
Yeah, well, looseness helps some-

‘Pastoral Symphony’

in Review

Wil icims

BY THAERN HAAG
An English critic once remarked
that listening to Ralph Vaughan
Williams’ “Pastoral Symphony
(No. 3)” was like watching a cow
chewing its -cud in a field

i somewhere. Both experiences, he

said, are completely uneventful.
But for persons who find no
pleasure in the maddening medio-
crity of modern urban life, the
gentle quietness and serenity of a
rolling meadow with only a cow for
company would be a welcome
relief. ' Such people are likely to

The unifying characteristic of
this collection is the composer’s
deep and abiding love for the

its flowing harmony and lively zest.
The first “Norfolk Rhapsody” is,
to my mind, the most lovely
testament to Vaughan Williams’
use of the folk song in his
composition. It is included in this

BY M.C. PILECKI
The effects of environment on
character is a question that has
intrigued the social scientists since,
well, since there have been social
scientists. Some dispute whether
there is any effect at all, while
others assume that environment is
the greatest factor in molding
A personality.
‘.__V./1-5 What it, all comes down to of
C‘: L’ 9 course is that everyone makes his
own opinion, as it’s obviously
impossible to prove any theory on
the subject.‘ Anton Chekhov, the
famous 19th century Russian
playwright, took off on his own
hypothesis and created Three
Sisters, the tale of how a crumbling
bourgeois town destroys the lives
of its leading citizens. ‘I A
The three ‘sisters are the
wealthiest, most highly educated
people in a village devoid of culture
except that provided by the military
stationed there. The eldest, Olga
(Jeanne Watts) is a lonely spinster
. WA schoolteacher, very sensitive and,
1. '~'t‘longing for a more fulﬁlling life
 devoted to a family. ,Masha (Joan
Plowright), unhappily married to a
local schoolmaster that she now
recognizes. as her intellectual
inferior, laments the waste of her
extensive education and carries on
a discreet affair with an older
officer (Alan Bates), likewise
unhappily married. The youngest,
Irina (Louise Purnell) living for the
day sheiand her sisters return to
Moscow, whiles away her time at
, unsatisfying jobs “with no poetry”
/S or lounging uncomfortably at
 V -.-“home. _
The catalytic character in this

“W 

   

      

family of boredom is Natasha
[Sheila Reed], the conniving young
wife of the sisters’ effete brother.

A native girl totally lacking in the
gentility of her in-laws, she creeps
into their lives and slowly takes

over their household, edging the 1
sisters away from their family"

home.

’As usual in Russian dramas,
there is really little plot, rather the
intricate weavings of characters in
a human tapestry. The story here,
of course, is the total dissolution of
a family of grace, discarded like a
fine silver chalice ‘in a corrosive salt
mine.

It should be noted that Three
Sisters is an American Film
Theatre'presentation, and should
be judged as a play-on-ﬁlm rather
than a real movie. By definition
then, the action is slow-moving,
changing only abruptly between
acts, and the meat of the drama lies
of course in the dialogue. There
are endless interesting exchanges

H between the philosophizing char-

acters, often intriguing and worthy
of subsequent thought.
Director Laurence Olivier kept

And How Can a Play—film,Lose? of 

the story flowing properly for the
camera, and occasionally made
good use of different lighting
effects to emphasize his characters.

He also has a role as the
not-quite-reformed alcoholic Dr.
Chebutikin. He’s a boarder and old
family friend who starts as an often
humorous, sympathetic character,
who like his friends goes on the
skids under the strangling inﬂu-
ences of the provinces. ' ' ’

As expected with AFT produc-
tions, the acting is superb and
cannot be faulted in any ‘manner.
The costumes evoke not only the
mood of the period but also
emphasize the personalities and
relationships of the ‘sisters, as do
the rather limited, but perfectly
detailed sets. The entire movie is
totally engrossing, without a trace
of self-consciousness so often
found when a “classic” is done.

Three Sisters will be shown only
April 8 and 9, two shows each day,
and will not- be_ shown again for
several years. So this is your last
chance to view not
“important play" in literature but
also a pretty good flick.

that shoul go with it.

Whether you're still in medical school with the
rigors of three to ﬁve years of graduate medical edu-
cation still to be faced. or are already a practicing
physician, it’s our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatement? Not if you c.onsider the '

speciﬁcs.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. It’s a period ofyour life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions. _

Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiv-ing training
in your own specialty, you’d be in contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging.

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-
ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con-
ducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future, you’ll ﬁnd it
in the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the
growing specialty of “family physician.” Whatever
your interest, there are few specialties which are not
being practiced in today’ s Air Force. A

The physician starting his practice in civilian
life has to take into account the cost of setting up an
office. The physician commencing his practice_in

the Air Force does not. He ﬁnds his office established
for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.

He has many options available to him when treating A

patients. For example, he can consult with Air Force
specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not
least, are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow—ups, and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physician, or soon to
become one, you might ﬁnd it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye-opener. Ifyou’ ll mail in the cou-
pon, we'd be happy to send you detailed information.

Despite dreary cold weather,
more suitable for catching a cold

- than competing in track, the Pitt

tracksters kept their head above
the water to ﬁnish among the top
contenders at the Colonial Relays
at Williamsburg, Virginia.

“It was definitely the worst
conditions at an outdoor meet I’ve
ever seen,” according to Head
Coach Jim Banner. “It was cold all
day Friday and then Saturday it
poured down rain.”

Along with the horrible weather,

. _   Page 12--THE PITT NEws——Monday. April 8, 1974

Tracksters Place High At Colonials 

bad luck also trailed the tracksters
to the meet.

Senior Chuck Mozingo, a stand-
out during the past indoor season
and one of the top quarter milers in
the East, pulled a leg muscle in the
second leg of the distance medley
relay and lost for the rest of the
meet. .

‘‘I’m not sure how bad Chuck's
injury is as of now but the
seriousness of an injury like that is
hard to tell. It's hard to say how
long he will be out.”

The loss of Mozingo plus Rich

Jackson, sidelined with mono-
nucleosus, took a lot out of
Banner’s bag of tricks.

Billy Rea kept on running up his
string of victories in the long jump,
winning the Colonial Relay leap
with a mark of 25 feet.

“Billy did another great job at
the meet," according to Banner.
“He not only won the event easily
but set the meet record for the
longest jump."

loss of anchorman Mozingo,

Defense Seeks Leaders

. BY RON SIEGEL

At first glance, it appears that
Johnny Majors won't have any
trouble replacing the seniors lost
from last year's defense, which
yielded just 16 points per game.
Majors has the talented people this
year, but Glenn Hyde, Jim
Buckmon. and Rod Kirby provided
leadership and direction that may
be hard to replace.

“It will be really difficult to
replace Hyde," said defensive line
coach Jim Dyar after a recent
practice session. “Glenn was a
heckuva leader and a football
player."

A cheerleader on and off the ﬁeld,
Hyde congratulated quarterback
Bob‘ Medwid with a bear hug so
ferociously- two years ago, he
‘injured Medwid’s ribs, forcing him

to miss several games.

  
   

Dyar won’t have to worry about
depth at tackle. He has three
letterment returning, plus an
All-Conference junior college
transfer.

Dave J ancisin now holds down the
starting slot on the left side.
“Dave played pretty well for us last
season," said Dyar. “He had a
stomach problem last season, and
he was up and down all year.
We're looking for some leadership
from him.”

Pat Gleich, who played beside
Panther noseguard Gary Burley at
Wharton Juinior College two years
ago, currently owns the right spot.

The other returning lettermen are
Don Parrish, who’s missing spring
drills due to injt/try, and Cecil
Johnson, who is now playing
linebacker, but could play tackle if

OUT OF THE LINEUP AGAIN is quarterback Bob Medwid. After
sitting out last year with inlurles, Medwid is out possibly for the
duration of spring drills with a broken ﬁnger.

needed.
Gleich played at defensive end
last season at Wharton, and

defensive tackle the year before.
“Pat would be limited. with us to
offensive or defensive tackle, and
right now it looks like it’ll be
defense," said Dyar. -
“It will be tough to replace a guy
that started for three years,” said
defensive coordinator Jackie
Sherrill about Buckmon. Sherrill
seems to have the troops to do it.
Tom Perko still holds the top spot
at right end, a position he grabbed
last year as a sophomore. “Even
though he’s just a junior, we’re

. looking to him for some leader-

ship,” said Dyar about the
two-time letterman.

A freshman letterman last season,
Ed Wilamowski currently has the
left end slot. “Ed did an excellent
job last year," said Sherrill. “We
should have played him a lot more
than we did.”

Although there’s a slew of’
aspirants for the defensive end
positions, the top competitor isn’t
on campus yet. That's Randy
Cozens, first-team junior college
All-American last year from Scotts-
dale, Anz. Cozens won’t begin
workouts with Pitt until the fall.

Sherrill still isn’t sure who will
replace Kirby, his signal-calling
linebacker. He’s had Arnie
Weatherington and Cecil Johnson
doing it in spring drills, but hasn’t
committed himself to either one.

Johnson and Weatherington have
the two linebacking slots in Pitt's
S-2 defense, but Kelcy Daviston is
missing due to an injury. The trio
possess plenty of game-experience,
and should all see a lot of action
next fall.

Burley is recovering from surgery,
and Al Romano is doing a whale of
a job at noseguard in his place,
according to Dyar.

“We don't have the intensity we
need yet," concluded Sherrill. “By

next fall though, we'll have things ,_

together."

SPRING THINGS--Bob Medwid
fractured the baby finger on his
throwing hand in a freak accident.
“I hit a kid's helmet afte releasing
a pass," he explained. “It
happened to Joe Namath once, and
that make me feel good," Medwid
will wear a cast for a while, and
may not be ready for the April 27
Blue-Gold game.

Jeff Hartin, a defensive back last
year, is playing wide receiver....
The defensive backfield of Glenn
Hodge, Dennis Moorehead, and
David Spates returns intact....With
Medwid injured, Dave Miglior
and George O’Kom are now
backup quarterbacks to Bill
Daniels.

“Rick did an outstanding job

"fact the team had never run

NEW YORK AP - Walt Frazier,

booed in his last game at Madison 1

Square Garden, ﬁred in 38 points
Sunday, including .16 in the last
quarter, propelling the New York
Knicks to a 106-105 victory over the
Capital Bullets in their National
Basketball Association playoff
game. ‘

The Knicks’ second straight
triumph, in the nationally televised
game, gave them a 3-2 lead in the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference
series. Game No. 6 will be played
Wednesday night at Landover,

. AP Golf Writer
GREENSBORO, N.C. AP--Lefty
Bob Charles of New Zealand turned

back a half dozen challengers with

we

a gritty 69 and won the Greater
Greensboro Open Golf Tournament
S_unday. A

The dark, dour Charles collected

$44,066 from the total purse of‘

$220,000 with his first American
triumph since 1967.

The slender Charles, now only a
parttime performer in the United
States, was tied by five players at
one time or another’, but won it with
a 270 total, 14-under-par on the

» 7,021-yard Sedgefield Country

Club course.

Former PGA champion Ray
Floyd and ﬂamboyant Lee Trevino,
each of whom had a share of the
lead at onetime, tied for second,
one stroke back at 271. Floyd, in a
long slump since his 1969 PGA
triumph, lost his share of the lead
with a bogey on the final hole. He
finished with a 67.

Trevino, a runaway winner at
New Orleans last week, had a 66
and shared the top spot until
Charles pulled away with a four
foot birdie putt on the 17th.

John Mahaffey, with a 69, and
Bruce Fleish'er, who had a closing
67, followed at 272.

Jim Jamieson, 70, had a 273
total. The group at 274 included
J.C. Snead, Canadian Wilf Bomen-
uik and Forrest ‘Fezler. Snead
moved up with a ﬁnal round 66,
Homenuik had a 67 and Frezler 68
before a massive gallery an-
nounced at 47,253.

South African Gary Player was
well back with a 70-276. Sam
Snead had a 69-284. 1

Jack Nicklaus, Tom Weiskopf
and Johnny Miller did not compete
in this, the last event before next
week’s prestige-laden Masters
tournament. Arnold Palmer and
Billy Casper failed to qualify for the
last two rounds. '

Charles, 39, a former British
Open Champion, gave up the
American tour in disgust last year
and now classifies himself as only a

 part-time performer.

He now spends most of his
playing time in Great Britain and

Europe.

 

 

New York’s all-star guard,
almost single-handedly repulsed
the Bullets in the frantic ﬁnal
period. He scored 14 of the Knicks)’
last 18 points, putting New York
ahead to stay 96-95 with a jump
shot with 3:39 remaining.

Then he set up Bill Bradley for
another jumper, giving New York a
98-95 advantage.

Capital's Mike Riordan, held
scoreless in the first half, hit a field
goal, giving him 14 points, and
putting the Bullets within 98-97.
But Frazier followed with a layup,
then stole the ball and drove for
another basket hiking New York's
lead to 102-97.

Elvin Hayes, the Bullets’ high
scorer, then dropped in two free
throws. Bradleycountered with a
jumper before Hayes and Phil
Chenier, who had .26 points,

  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  

 

connected on field goals leaving
New New York ahead 104-103.

But Frazier, whose total points
were a career high playoff ﬁgure
for him, then connected on his ﬁnal
basket and the last "one for New
York, a iumper with 33 seconds
left. ‘Capital's Wes Unseld got the
game's last basket.

The Knicks had led 55-53 after a
very heated first half. Chenier and
Bradley exchanged words after
Chenier tumbled to the ﬂoor while
driving for the basket iiithe first
period. Capital's Kevin Porter was
taggedwith a technical foul after
being called for his fourth personal
with five seconds left in the second
quarter, and both" teams criticized
the officiating of Earl Strom and
Bob Rakel. At the intermission,
both Strom and Rakel received a

Naturally, a great camera like the

That's up to you. Yet—it’s nice to
know that your camera can grow

- with you as a photographer.-

Part of the reason for this is the
F-1 system. Since it was designed
in totality, it offers total perform-
ance. There is nothing "added on"
in the F-1 system. Everything works
as it was designed to, and inte-
grates superbly with everything
else. You'll spend lesstime worrying
about operating the camera than in
shooting. And that's what creative
photography is really all about.
Controls fall into place under
each finger. It’s no accident. Pro-
fessionalswho depend on a camera

 amazing how much a comfortable

 camera can improve your work.

But it was rookie Nick Weather-

Meanwhile, Porter, who had

mated $500,000 with the World
Football League's Honolulu Ha-
the San Jose News
reported in its Saturday editions.

Kwalick will play out his option
year. this season with the National
Football League team before

:i«iI .. jumping to theiWFL in 1975 for the

offer that reportedly includes a
pineapple plantation and a condo-

’ minium.

§‘They offered a heck of a deal

and I took it because I felt it was
4' best for my family," said Kwalick

in a telephone interview with the

 To World Football

newspaper from Honolulu. “I feel
the 49ers were as fair to me as they
could be in their offer. I only wish
that they could have come closer to
the Hawaii offer."

Kwalick, who has caught 151
passes for 1,324 yards and 21

t ‘touchdowns in his'NFL career, said

he was looking forward to a good
final season with the 49ers.

Kwalick refused to release the
details of the contract with the
Hawaiians, but the newspaper said
they were supplied by a source
within the 49er organization.

The newspaper said Kwalick
currently makes about $50,000 a
year with the 49ers.

  Kuhn Forces Aaron’s Bat

By ED SHEARER
AP Sports Writer

CINCINNATI AP--Henry Aaron,
playing under a direct order from
baseball commissioner Bowie
Kuhn, went hitless in three trips to
the plate Sunday against the
Cincinnati Reds before leaving the
game in the middle of the seventh
inning. .

Kuhn, in what a Braves official
called “an unprecedented order,”
had forced the Atlanta Braves to
use their 40-year-old slugger
against their wishes. .

Aaron smashed the 714th home
run of his career on opening day
here Thursday to tie the all-time

record set in 1935 by the legendary
Babe Ruth.

Aaron was called out on strikes
in the second and third innings,
facing Cincinnati right-hander Clay
Kirby. ‘

In, his only other appearance,
Aaron bounced out to third base.

Aaron was the sixth batter in the
order when the Braves hit in the
seventh inning, but reliever Fred
Norman retired the ﬁrst three
batters.

As Ralph Garr bounced back to
Norman with two down, Aaron

_picked up his glove and began

walking to the Atlanta clubhouse.
He was replaced in the batting

Pa. Horse Racing

Comm. Conducts Raids

PHILADELPHIA AP--The
Pennsylvania Horse Racing Com-
mission has conducted raids on
thoroughbred tracks in the belief
some winning horses may have
been drugged, the Philadelphia
Bulletin reported Sunday.

The paper said commission
chairman Joseph L. Leece hired
Dan Madden of Kentucky to handle

« the probe, which came following

complaints by horsemen to Gover-

. nor Milton Shapp.

Leece said three stable raids
have been conducted so far as part

of the investigation, and according
to the Bulletin, each raid turned up
illegal hypodermic needles.

Leece said he believed all of the"

raids had been at the Penn National
Race Course near‘ Harrisburg, the
paper reported. '

Edward S.‘ Finkelstein, an

\attorney for the protesting horse-

men, told the paper that he_ thought
nearly a dozen raids had been
conducted.

Leece said that as a result of the
continuing investigation, three
trainers have been suspended. 4 --

order by rookie Rowland Office,
who went into the game in center
field. Garr moved from right ﬁeld
to left field and Dusty Baker moved
from center to right. _

A controversy had swirled for
months over the playing status of
Aaron in Cincinnati after Braves
officials announced intentions not
to use him here.

Kuhn countered that with a
statement that he “expected” the
Braves to use their star in the same
manner they had last year, playing
roughly two of every three games.

Manager Eddie Mathews in-
curred the wrath of the commis-J
sioner Saturday when’ he an-
nounced that Aaron would not play
again before the Braves’ home
opener against the Los Angeles
Dodgers Monday night in a game
to be televised nationally.

Kuhn retaliated with a demand

'that the Braves play Aaron Sunday '

or face “serious consequences.”

“Because of this order and the AA

threatenedpenalties, I intend to
start Hank Aaron tomorrow,” a
weary Mathews said at a news
conference’ Saturday night.

Aaron said before Sunday’s
game, “I.don’t want to get involved

in the commissioner’s -decision. I_

believe the Braves had the right to
promote the only thing going for
them right now.’?

Atlanta's original announcement
contributed greatly to a pre-game
sale of tickets for their home
opener.

A benefit concert for the needy of
the South Oakland community will
be held Tuesday at 8:30 pm. in the
Student Union ballroom. Spon-
sored by the Chaplains Association
and the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes, the concert features the
music of Kenny Marks.

“This concert represents a way in
which we can reach out to meet the
needs of underprivileged people in
the community and it provides a
way we can share the message of
Jesus Christ,” said Mark Ross of
the Christian Athletes.

According to Ross and member
Ken Wagoner, the Athletes have
been helping Oakland needy
through co-operation with an
Oakland woman, Fanny Royston.

“Those are just about the finest
young men I have ever seen in my
life," Royston said of the Christian
Athletes. ‘‘I didn't know where l
was going to turn for helf and then
these boys showed up with a
carload full of food.” Royston is a
Goodwill Ambassador in Oakland
and had given of her own time and
money to aid the people around
her.

“From time to time those young
men bring us more goods. They’re
just beautiful," Royston said

According _to Ken Wagoner, the

Christian Athletes, who have also
been active at juvenile court, are
realizing there is a lot to be done in
serving the community around the

“As we are residents of Oakland

to find the needy. There are people
