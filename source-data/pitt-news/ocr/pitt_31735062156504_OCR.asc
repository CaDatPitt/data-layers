Dr. Lee, who has been granted

decision to accept this new job.
“The honest situation is that I’m

Academic Prospects‘ Poor

“More important“ is that, as I
see it right now, general academic
‘prospects are not very favorable
for the future. Universities have
to get money somewhere.

“Sometimes they get it from stu-
dents in the form of high tuition.
Great rises in tuition are not feasi-

death knell for any ideas of fed-

‘ Researcher Says

I Who talks _ more, men or
‘ women, has been the subject
A of debate since the time Eve
‘persuaded her pliable spouse
‘to eat some fresh fruit.

- A modern researcher at Pitt
with a scientiﬁcbent has done
some observing on the sub-
.ject. He notes ﬁrst that men
outnumber women two to one
on the campus. Secondly, he
perceives that on the eighth
ﬂoor (predominantly inhab-
' _ited_ by males) there is one
public telephone. On’ t-he
Atwelfth ﬂoor, traditionally for
females, he sees two public
" ’phones. . .

Rubbing his hands with un-
_ scientiﬁc glee, at his ﬁndings,

our incipient researcher ﬁg-
. Aures thusly: the two-to-‘one
ratio of men to women juggled
_with. the fact that there are
twice as many ’phones on the
. twelfth ﬂoor than. on . the
eighth, produces the mathe-
I matical conclusion that women
‘talk four times as much as

men. l ‘

ndia Project   Fuml Swell:

‘3  Since the fund drive for “’1*roject India” was announced
»last week in the Pitt News,'almost $2,200‘ has been collected
to send Mary Fuget-on the trip to India. The many organi-
5z’ation’s' that contributed money to buy two live 7pan_ther_
mascots last year gave their permission to have these funds
Tturnedl over. to" Mary "for her trip.'_ Anonymous donors, stu-
*dent organizations, fraternities and sororities, and individu-
..als have donated almost enough to make the proposed trip
,a. foertainty. 1 C

  ‘would like to add our thanks to those of Mary Fuget,
Alfred C. Payne, Chaplain Luccock, and the.other__organ1zers
of the .project at Pitt. The response by_the students and‘
;facul't-y hasbeen wonderful. i-It is certainly gratifying to
know: that people have the ability to recognize the value
fsuchha project andthe generosity to back it with ﬁnan-
l aid. ~ I — ..

To date, the $2,200 collected is slightly short of the
‘$2,500-mark set as the goal. It iséjudged that this latter
*mount will be suﬁicient to obtain the most beneﬁt from
the two—rnonth trip through India for the inter-faith,.inter-
‘rva‘cial experiment in‘ international relations. Of the total
amount,'$l,500 will -be spent for transportation to and from I
;India.» The rest will be used to enable Mary to travel
"throughout India with the other seven "students from Ameri-
_a7._as the live, travel, and work with the people there. We
fhope'that those who have not yet been able--to contact the
"ommittee' handling the project will doso in order’ that the
"goal7may be achieved. Ch-ecksgand money_.orders may be

For the second year in a row,
Delta Tau Delta has been dis-
qualiﬁed in the Sweepstakes
event of Spring Festival.’ It is
signiﬁcant that both times, the
Delts were the winners of the
event. Last year -the dispute
arose when; it
was charged
that the racer
used by the
Delts. was the
property of
the Carnegie
Tech’ chapter‘
. and the driver
of the vehicle
w.a s not a
member of the
chapterhere. On the first charge,
I {don’t believe there was any
dispute. On the second, it was
. one person’s word against ‘the
other.
~ This year, the charge by other
fraternities was that the racer
was again not the property of
the Pitt Delts but was purchased

This column, which will proba-

for the event.
Was It Legal?

Therules for the event say
only that the racer must be the

property of the fraternity. The ,

D'elts had. a bill" of sale proving‘
that the vehicle was their prop-
erty. .

When this fact was introduced
at a h_earing“committee, it was
decided that the Deltshad not
violated any rules set "up by

. _ ieither _Interfraternity Council or
the Festival committee. The dis-,_
qualiﬁcation went through, how-*

ever, on the basis. of vthe~state-
ment that the organization had
violated “t-_he.purpose and spirit
of the Festival.”
Same Story M,

This was the same argument
that eventually dropped the Delts
from the race last year. Whether

we agree or not withithe corn: "

mittee’s decision is not the idea
here. When itcomes to the point
where you have to judge a con-
test on the basis of ethics, and

not rules, things are getting a

could‘ let the ash trays overﬂow.
Then, when the person is ready

to leave, he could pour a glass of
water on the table and clear the_

_whole works away. _
The libraries 'can’t do much
about books being out, but
they can do something about
the stiﬂi fines and the slow
service. Fifteen minutes is too.
long to wait for any book and
ﬁve cents a day is too much tbs
pay for any overdue book’. The
periodical room is the worst of
the libraries. Any book "in the
catalogue of the Periodical room

is always there and ﬁrfes are non— —

existent, because no books may
be taken from the room. This. is
great to keep all the books in one
~ place, but it doesn’t give much
freedom to study a book. Put a

few stout chains on the books .

and the librarians can be elim-»
inated. ' ' ‘
Those hour and a half classes
could stand alittle redesigning,
too. A class -which meets three
tirnes a week is in -session'for a

total of 150 minutes, but an hour '

and "a half» class that continues
without a break for the entire
period is insession for a total of
160 minutes. The extra time is

ﬁne forlearning, but as a French-
man, in the United Nations’ once
said, “The mind can absorb only
as much as the seat can endure.”

Let Them Out
Instructors who hold students

I

   

little out of hand. And while we

-are at it, don’t forget the", com. .
-petitive spirit that- is supposed .-._ 

to be fostered by such an event. ~
Weighing the arguments on
either side and the conditions of
this event and preceding ones, "it
appears that the main fault lies
with the Festival committee» for
the V Sweepstakes event. After
one such experience as last year,’

 it is only reasonable to assume

that some provisions,_laws, rules,
moral codes‘, or something, would
have been laid down to forstall
such an occurrence. * ‘

. It ‘Would «Be Worth It ‘

The embarrassment, hard feel-Y
ings, and bad‘ publicity on the
whole matter could be avoided

by a simple set of rules or at least 

an agreement among the persons
or groups concerned. It-‘would
take little enough time for the
involved groups to get together‘
and iron out the matter and the;
prevention of another such inci-
dent would be well worth the
time and trouble.

after the bell’ rings should re.
ceive calendars as presents. It

the discussion is interesting to

some, then’ dismiss the class and
allow anyone to stay if he is in-
terested.’Otherwise,.let them out.

Now‘ for the nice part," Since
everyone is busy at the end of
the semester why not have some-
thing called “rest week”? This

rest week" could start about two

weeks before the end of the
semester. The University would
close down and ‘instructors and
students could both get unﬁn-
ished work caught up.

We have only one more issue
of the News so it’s too late this
year to start anything in the way
of a campaign or -crusade. Let’s .
leave it at that until Fall.- Until

"then WSGA can have a rest and '

Student Congress can plan a col-
lective summer course in “Stu-
dent Government: It’s ‘ Theory
and Operation.” ‘

Ricketts had Pitt fanning the
breeze the ﬁrst three innings until,

him for the ﬁrst hit. Niemela
poked out another single, but Rick-
etts struck out the next two bat-
ters to end the inning.

Then, in the ﬁfth, it was Shan-
non himself who drew ﬁrst blood.
The stocky junior belted a triple
to right center and scored the ﬁrst
run of the game on Harry Little’s
line single. .

Three more hits in ‘the sixth
wound up the scoring for the day.
Ollie Niemela started it with the

‘followed with a drive down the
right field line—-which the Dukes
‘hotly claimed was foul+good for

fall‘ and then went to San Fran-
cisco to star in the East-West Shine
game on offense and defense.

in the fourth Sam Rago clipped

second of his three singles. Filek’

showed excellent control, Shannon
walking only one and the 6-8 bas-
ketball star walking two-—-all in
the ﬁrst inning.

“Ricketts is the fastest pitcher
we've seen all season,” said _Mit—
terling after the game. “But our
boys played the best they have -all
year. Shannon pitched superb
ball.”

The Panthers turned in a spark-

ling defensive performance, como _ .

mitting not one error and coming
up with the tough plays.
W & _J Today

Even though the Dukes "were
credited with a hit in the eighth
inning, an alert relay from Kyle
to Filek to Rago, which nipped
Duquesne’s Steve Nigro trying to
stretch a bloop single-, enabled
Shannon to retire ‘the last 15 bat-
ters in order. _ .

This afternoon Pitt hosts W&J
at Mellon Field, ‘and Mitterling
will start Don Miller in the hope
of upping the won-lost record to

News Tries Hand
At All-Americans

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

  

 morning the Pitt News set in motion a plan which
might possibly end up as an exclusive feature in collegiate
football. , E

Pursuing an idea originated by Carroll “Beano” Cook,

500_ colleges as the ﬁrst step in an effort to establish a Pitt

.cor_nprehensively judged team. _
-The success of the whole thing depends, of course,_ upon the’
r'esp‘onse_ we receive. __ '
After talking with a number of sports writers, Beano i*eports
that a heavyimajority of editors must go along with the idea in order‘
for the results to be valid, probably 80 ‘per cent.
' Since the idea» is a new one, it may take some time before the
project gains any authority. If it works, that is. —
' At present, news services, writers associations, and maga-

areselected before the season begins.= More often the teams are

made up before the season is over to get the jump on other se-

lectors. " ~ , g
The only valid method would be to do the picking after all the

..sure a representative sample by contacting people who follow foot-
ball avidly weekafter, week. _ .
There is probably nothing wrong with the present system; next

“iencedsports writer is qualified to judge the top talent in the game?
‘ ‘But our idea is to ‘place the question. of selection directly.
into the hands ofthe colleges themselves. ,

~And even though‘ one could cull a fair country team purely

As we’ve "said, though, ‘everything depends‘ upon. the coopera-

very‘ high '' this time of the year, what with baseball, ﬁnal exams,
spring activities, and graduation. -

. Switching from basketball to golf is quite a job if one
contrasts whacking a ‘small white pellet with a club to
dropping a ball thirty times larger into a hoop. -

Nevertheless, Phil Hubacher, ace junior golfer for Pitt,
has played and mastered both sports.

After graduating from Carnegie High School in 1948
where he was a cage star, Phil was offered a basketball

scholarship to Bethany College 1“
Lewisburg, Kansas, a Prep 5311001
for the University of Kansas.
However, much to the disappoint-
ment of the Kansans, I-Iubacher
rejected the offer, feeling" the
school was too fargfrom his home.
Even though he refused that of-
fer, he was determined to 30 to
college.’ In 1951 the 5'11”, 165-
pound blond youth chose Pitt as
his college home.

I Came Through

Then in February of this year,
an’ athletic bulletin announced
Pitt's 1953 graduation-riddled golf
squad had a few promising ﬁrst
year men. Hubacher was mention-
ed as one of the rookies and has

-come along to prove that he is

more than promising by winning
eight of nine matches to be the
best golfer on the team. _ .
His best performance to dat
has been against Carnegie Tech
when he shot atwo under par 69
on the Shannopin course.

Phil learned the game of golf
as a caddie, much the same as
most golfers. In his younger years
he lugged golf bags’ over the
greens of Chartiers Country Club
in Carnegie. During these caddie
days, he received a few playing
tips from his uncles, who play

golf regularly, but on the whole

he learned by watching his cus-

tomers and by getting a few licks
at the ball in idle moments.
' Alert Caddie

“‘I think being a caddie is the
only way to know the game be-
cause you’re out- there everyday
watching and seeing the mistakes
others make,” Phil says.

“If everything goes well, I hope
to make a career of golf because I
really enjoy the sport,” the 22-
year-old Phil relates. He ﬁgures
on joining‘ the South Park Coun-
try Club this summer with a view
toward becoming a top amateur
and maybe joining the ranks of
the pros.

’ If working a whole summer to
pay for a set of golf clubs shows
Phil’s determination to succeed,
