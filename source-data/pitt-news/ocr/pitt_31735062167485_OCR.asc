Speaks to Young
Pittsburgh Crowd

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

Most of the signs read “Mc-
Carthy for President" or “Mc-
Carthy for Peace in ‘68." Many
of them carried make—love—not—
war symbols. One read “War is
Bad for Babies." Another said
simply “Gene.”

The atmosphere was carnival-
like. Men sold balloons and but-
tons. Many people wore straw
hats covered with “McCarthy for
President” stickers. A band play-
ed Dixieland music.

At noon, the appointed hour of
the arrival of presidential hope-
ful Eugene McCarthy. the crowd
in Mellon Square Park number-
ed approximately 5,000. It was,
according to former legislator
Harry Davenport, “The largest
Pittsburgh crowd ever to greet a
political figure.”

The crowd was composed most-
ly of high school and college stu-
dents. They seemed, almost des-
perately, to be trying to gain sup-
port for a man who, more than
any other possible candidate, em-
bodied the principles they believ-
ed in.

One observer remarked, “There
must be 200 voters in the whole
crowd.” Another remarked, “I
don’t know what these kids are
getting worked up about. They
can’t even vote.”

McCarthy, smiling amiably,
ascended the speakers platform.
The crowd cheered. He held up
his fingers in a V-for—Victory.
The crowd imitated him and
cheered louder. He held up his
hand for quiet and the roar sub-
sided.

He said what everyone expect-
ed him to say. He attributed a

The United Oakland Min-
istry was no place for whites
last Tuesday. It was the show-
ing of the movie, Malcolm X
- Struggle for Freedom. Des-
pite the sticky 90 d e g r e e
weather, the church was packed
with over 500 people, predomin-
ately blacks. Many were wearing
brightly colored African — style
tunics. beads, sandels and jeans.

The movie itself was only about
15 minutes long. Malcolm X was
shown discussing the problems of
the black man. Scenes of various
racial struggles were scattered
throughout the film.

“The blackman has been strip-
ped of his blackness — his black
name. culture and history,” said
Malcolm X. He suggested that
the struggle for racial freedom
must be placed on an internation-
al level. “Our struggle is related
to the African struggle,” he said.
“If Africa is strong, we will have
respect for the black man in
America.

“Black Americans are begin-
ning to look back at Africa for
strength,” added Malcolm X and
concluded, “We are fighting for
our place in the sun and we will
not rest until the place has been
secured.”

After the movie, a panel of four
members of the Black Community
met to discuss the movie. Each
man gave his impression of the
film. The first speaker was Sam
House head off the Afr0-Americ-

good portion of his success to stu-
dents. He denied accusations that
he was causing a split in the
Democratic party. He voiced his
opposition to the Vietnam war.

“The war." according to Sena-
tor McCarthy. “is the key to all
our problems. It drains off our
economic, social, and moral en-
ergies. leaving little to solve the
great domestic problems.”

While McCarthy spoke, people
in the crowd glanced nervously
at the tall buildings surrounding
Mellon Square.

 

McCARTHY HELD UP his hand for quiet and the noise of the crowd subsided.

can Institute. Mr. House wore a
brightly patterned pants and a
tunic of Afro-style and greeted
his audience with “Shalom Ale-
chim.” He said that he was deep-
ly moved by the movie. “I must
question myself——am I living up
to the standard of Malcolm X?”
Mr. House commented that cer-
tain bloody riot scenes reminded
him of “the Viet Cong and Cen-
ter Ave. not long from now.”

Ed Alias, sporting a beard and
a black and orange stripped shirt,
spoke next. Mr. Alis, director of
Half-Way Art Gallery, said,
“This film should not have been
shown here — it should have been
shown to an all black audience.”
The current things dealing with
blacks. he explained, are all be-
ing shown in the white universi-
ty. “Should we really give the
whites this type of knowledge?”
he asked.

Jarvis Turner, a businessman-
type and director of the WEB Du-.
Bois Boys Club in Philadelphia,
spoke third. He agreed with Mal-
colm X’s statements and said that
“Black people must overthrow
capitalish to gain freedom. So-
cialism is necessary for freedom.”
He added that he hoped the
whites in the audience were not
there “out of sympathy but be-
cause they realized that racism
can poison whites too. They
should be here out of empathy —
not sympathy.”

The last speaker was the Rev.

by JUDITH GALARDI

Tuesday afternoon to hear presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy maintain that “We have to
face up to the important issues facing this country.”

Richard Mates of the McCarthy Headquarters in Oakland was not surprised at the turnout.

He said that they had passed out over 100,000 sheets of literature concerning McCarthy’s visit

to Pittsburgh.

Senator McCarthy made his appeal to the general public, not just one group. He said that our coun-
try has great strength in its judgment, which will prove itself this year.

‘ Congratulating the public for its effect on politics in ‘68, he said he wants the people to hear all
candidates, especially a “public debate between myself and Vice President Humphrey.”

' Hesuggested that.“a»-l’l the people should have the opportunity to hear each candidate, and then make
their decision.” Since the people had been so active this year, “they had effected all the candidates in such

_ a way,” according to the Senator.

    

dressed, Rev. Robinson said, “I
have come through the stages of
being white. then Negro, then
black. It’s difficult to change and
accept black when all your life
you’ve heard that black is bad.”
He agreed that the movie should
not have been shown to whites.

The panel then refused to de-
bate among themselves. “We
want to show everyone that we
agree on everything.” said Mr.
House.

‘Pitt News’ Review

His acceptance of this enor-

mous responsibility of saying

what he really believes has effect-
ed many people. Edward Sadlow-
ski, president of Steelworkers Lo-
cal No. 65 in Chicago, said, “Sen—
ator McCarthy is taking a very
courageous stand in politics. He’s
partially responsible for the Paris
peace talks and President John-
son’s decision not to run a sec-
ond term.”

After reiterating to the people
that they are to make the choice
and that the delegates are to rep-
resent them, he said, “The dele-
gates must be aware of whatit
means to be a presidential con-
vention delegate and that they
bear the full burden of democra-
cy in America.

“Only after the people hear the
entire story from both the Demo-

cratic candidates,” M c C a r t h y
stated in his typical sincerity, ‘I
will be content to hear the judg-
ment of the convention.”’ Meyer
Burger, national treasurer of the
Americans for Democratic Action
(ADA), and president of the Pitts-

burgh Chapter of the ADA, who s

will be a delegate-at-large at the
convention said, “McCarthy has
a chance at the convention.” Mr.
Burger aided the Senator during
his stay in Pittsburgh.

Not all persons present were for
the Senator. Frank Panzarella,
president of‘ Steelworkers Local
No. 845 in Downey, Calif., said,
“McCarthy has never been con-
nected to any legislation worth
anything. He’s arrogant.”

McCarthy said, “We can no

longer delay our decision about
Vietnam.”

 

  ‘Odd Couple’ Refreshing  

by RISE WEINBERG

It is rare to find a movie with-
out sex, violence, deep symbol-
ism, or slap—stick comedy that is
adult entertainment and not a
product of Walt Disney Studios.
The Odd Couple is just such a
movie. It is plain, unvarnished
cleverness.

Credit for the movie’s success
must go to a witty script and ex-
cellent acting by Jack Lemmon
and Walter Matthau. The audi-
ence laughed so often that I oc-
cassionally missed the following
line from the movie.

Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a
compulsive cleaner, recently sep-
arated from his wife, and home-
less. Walter Matthau is Oscar, a

  
 

 

total slob, who has gotten accus-

  
 

tomed to divorce, and takes Felix
in. Thus, we are thrust into the
domestic difficulties of these two
opposites.

Both actors do an exceptional
job of putting themselves into
their character. Jack Lemmon is
probably the better of the two,
although his role is more the de-
manding. He is required to be
highly emotional and frequently
become hysterical over his sep-
aration. He also runs around the
apartment in an apron, dusting,
and sweeping. Walter Matthau
is really hilarious following Jack
Lemmon around the apartment
dirtying where Lemmon has just
cleaned. He is also quite funny
discussing overdue a I i m o n y
checks with his estranged wife
over thet. who  0

 
  

 
   

Some of the best scenes involve
the couple’s domestic quarrels.
They fight over typical things,
such as meat -loaf and dirty foot-
prints on the livingroom carpet;
These topics are only_funny be-
cause two mature men are the
ones having such a petty argu-
ment.

One of the outstanding scenes
is the one in which Oscar tells off
Felix and throws him out of the
apartment. Oscar begs Felix to
behave normally a n d let of f
steam occasionally. He wants Fe-
lix to have a real fight with him.
Felix says that Oscar is a really
nice guy, a true friend, and prob-
ably the best thing that ever hap-
pened to him. Oscar remarks,

Deficiencies

University. )
by PAUL STOLLER
Pitt News Editor

The information explosion has expanded the scope of
knowledge in the past two decades. What was relevant ten
years ago is now irrelevant. But the information explosion has
caused a great many problems in the “bureaucratic” world.
Organizations have had to expand their membership in order
to cope with the increasing volumes of specialized informa-
tion. This trend has caused increased bureauracy and “red
tape.”

Every functioning organization has had to specialize and
channel its activities. And this channel-
ing has resulted in what Professor Har-
old Wilensky calls “information patholo-
gies” — intelligence (all information) fail-
ures that have caused organizational fail-
ures.

Information pathologies concern the dis-
tortion or the withholding of various data
within the organizational hierachy. And ev-
ery organization is susceptible to these in-
formation failures.

These “pathologies” are rooted within
the organizational hierachy. One cause for an information
failure or pathology lies the very structure of the organiza-
tion. Organizations that have a pyramid structure—a great
many middle level positions with a few top level jobs—are
quite susceptible to information distortion.

The‘ University administrative structure falls within this
category. And, to be sure, the top level administrators at the
University have been subject to information distortion. In any
organization of the pyramid type, information must pass u -
ward on the communications chain; it must pass from the sug-
ordinate administrative levels to the top levels of the admin-
istrative hierachy.

However, a number of factors inhibit the upward pass-
age of credible information. Information, to the administra-
tive subordinate, is equated with status, advancement, and
administrative security. And every “subordinate” wants des-
parately to advance on the organization ladder. Consequently,
the information that he gathers and passes upward has a di-
rect bearing_ on his personal career. The subordinate will,
therefore, take great pains to send up information that will
please his superior. Many times this information is distorted
in order to please the superior or rationalize a subordinate
failure.

Another drawback to the pyramid organizational struc-
ture is that the various subordinate specialized departments
will compete with each other. This competition was readily
observable in the Bay ‘of Pigs fiasco when the State Depart-
ment predicted that Cuban participation in an invasion would
be negligible. The CIA, an arch-rival of the State Depart-
ment, ignored the incongruent information. The result is now
history.

This competition factor can be observed within the Uni-
versity administration. Here there are four areas of special-
ization: Student Affairs, Finances, Academics, and Program-
ming and Development. However, the specialized functions
of these four areas sometimes overlap. And in this situation,
a certain degree of competition results that can be harmful
to credible information output.

Perhaps the most disruptive factor involved in the casual
process of “information pathologies” concerns secrecy. And
here, the University does not provide an exception to the rule.
Many University decisions are made with the utmost degree
of secrecy. Sometimes secrecy is essential. But, more often
than not, secrecy is detrimental to both the legitimacy and
advisability of any decision.

When a decision is made within the aura of secrecy, the
information used to support the decision cannot be upheld to
public scrutiny. Thus, the information can only be viewed
from one angle—the viewpoint of the administrative hierachy.
Secrecy inhibits the beneficial aspects of public debate. Thus,
if the University administration decided to raze Pitt Stadi-

STOLLER

um in order to build a Medical School complex, the decision

would not reflect the diverse sentiments of either the faculty
or the students. Instead, the decision would represent the
single viewpoint of the administration. This situation repre-
sents the dual risks of information pathology and illegitimate

decision making.

Police Paradox

Politics Fake Out Law and Order

by Hobart Harris

In my last column, I pointed out that too
much time had been spent discussing, indivi-
dual incidents of police brutality, and not
enough time discussing them as part of the
Society’s system of Social Control. The police

as an institution is outmoded, not corrupt.

The problem is not to criticize the police
incident by incident, but to analyze why the
police came into being when they did, what
functions they served, and how things have
changed since then. The changes in Society
should proscribe the changes in the police
force, and not vice versa.

Well, what has changed For one thing, the
racial make—up of the lower class. It used to be
predominantly European Catholic. Now it is
Negro. And then, of course, there is the problem
of mobility--the middle class neighborhood is too
amorphous and changing to be much of a control-
ling influence on anybody; everyone knows what
the ghetto is like.

There are a million other things.

The Point Here is obvious the present system
is crumbling, and it is no surprise that the police
are the most visible part of the heap. After all,
they’re the ones in charge of fitting the round
heads into the square holes, and when the process
fails, you don’t see the Mayor Barr’s of America
out there trying to restore order. You see the pol-
ice. Mayor Barr is too busy drafting public state-
ments calling for Law and Order.

It is pretty hard for me to hate the police,
or even call for major reform. The police are paid
$100 a week or so to get shot up doing their duty
and have searching articles written about them in
the likes of Playboy and the Pitt News. They’re
not allowed, to have any public political senti-
ments, and are marched in official statements like
some kind of virginity ._corps, designed to protect
law and order, help old" ladies across the street,
and never, never, complain.

The point I’m trying to make is that whether

 

How Our Readers See  

they’re meaning to or not. the people who are win-
ning in this Society have got the rest of us in the
perfect bind. Instead of fighting for our well being
and our freedom, we’re fighting each other. Com-
plaints against the people in charge. The riots are
not the problem, the causes of the riots are the
problem. And if we (Students and blacks) concen-
trated on those, the Mayor Barrs of the country
might have to do something about it.

THE RIOTS,the looting and the lawlessness
are the public groans of millions of people whose
problems won’t be solved by police reform, they
will be solved by governmental reform. The police
are at best a trivial problem. The society is the
real problem. Perhaps one hundred people die from
“brutal” acts committed by the police in a year.
How many die of drug overdosed in a single week!
The police brutality issue is the biggest fake-out
of the century.Instead of the blacks, the students
and the police fighting, the establishment, they’re
fighting each other, and Mayor Barr is up for
another term.

Many people think of the brutality as an ex-
pression of the kind of personality or of a special
mentality or racism or whatever in the police.
But I would look at it a little differently. Most of
the police were recruited before the riots, during
the time when they enjoyed nuch more respect
and had the kind of image that nowadays is lim-
ited to first grade primers.

And most of them still try to act in the same
way when they can. I somehow have a felling
that a good deal of their brutality is their way of
groaning. The cause! Massive criticism that they
can’t understand or cope with.

AND THE BEAUTY of it is that since most of
the police are from lower middle class, origins
where revolution, even change is anathema. So
instead of fighting for themselves as policemen,
they fight against the people who they perceive
are challenging their way of life, the demonstra-
tors, while the people who are the real danger,
in this city Mayor Barr and his machine, sit in-
violate, protected by the very hatred, greed, and
misery that have set the police and the students
at each other’s throats.

Reform the Police! Hell. Get rid of the Mayor.

 

ROTC Program -— Not A Problem

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

The recent recommendation
(on ROTC at the University) of
the Student Government Liberal
Arts Cabinet and your whole-
hearted agreement with them do
not take into consideration the
nature nor the purpose of the pro-
gram.

It should be noted that the
ROTC program here does show
the existence of academic free-
dom. Unlike other institutions,
ROTC is purely voluntary — not

 

5Q2z~(, BABY,
We 26 OUTTA-

LITTLE MAN  CAMPUS

compulsory. Like all other courses
it is left up to the free choice of
the student. How does this deny
academic freedom?

In schools where, ROTC is com-
pulsory, the school obviously has
control over the program in this
respect. By forcing a student to
enter a program against perhaps
his moral principles, these schools
are denying him his academic
freedom. Because of the volun-
tary nature of this program, the
student who takes ROTC here

 

would more likely be taking the
course “in a spirit of inquiry.”

Thus, he is most certainly as-
sured rather than denied his aca-
demic freedom. The SGLAC has
ignored the ultimate purpose of
the course; namely, the training
of military officers. The military
stresses coordination and uni-
formity. If the ROTC program
were to deviate from the Defense
Department outline, it would be
defeating its own purpose. The
Army and Air Force would have
regular officers as well as unique
University of Pittsburgh officers.
The Pitt officers may not know
much about the military or what
the military expects of them, but
they will be well versed in the
“humanistic and/or political ana-
lysis of military actions.”

Finally, you might re-examine
your position on whether Pitt is
doomed to “subjugate itself to
outside control.” The University
does, not “support professors of
military science” — their respec-
tive services do. It is also within
the rights of the Univeristy to
eliminate ROTC from the cam-
pus at any time.

The SGLAC and The Pitt News
have failed, therefore, in estab-

_lishing that ROTC in its present

form is a problem —— much less a
serious one. Clearly ROTC does
not violate the concept of aca-
demic freedom — a foreign lan-
guage or physical science course
is equally as regimented. ROTC
has just as definite a purpose as
do other programs here. Finally.
the presence of ROTC does in no
way bind this University or its
students. In view of these facts.
it hardly exists as a problem.
