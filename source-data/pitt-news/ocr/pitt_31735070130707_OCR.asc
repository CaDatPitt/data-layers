Mike Unangst and his friends
stayed up all of Tuesday night putting
in » North and South
Oakland and in the dorms. Their hard
work paid off as Unangst was chosen
as the next Student Government
Board president last night.

Nearly 50 people crowded in
SGB’s board room last night to watch
as Unangst won with 1,149 votes to

Este Griffith’s 816 and Michael Guss’ .

Only 2,195 of Pitt’s nearly 14,000

posted the number of votes for each
candidate on a dry-erase board in the
front of the room. The room quickly
filled as Snyder wrote the results from
Benedum Hall, the William Pitt
Union, the Cathedral of Learning and
David Lawrence Hall.
Only Towers remained, and with
1,151 students voting, it helped put
_Unangst and the successful board can-,

The top eight vote-getters of the

.12 candidates running have earned a

spot on next -year’s board. They are
Jeff Alex, Rob Brown, Sara Dadlani,
Jay Dworin, Becca Normand, Kya'
Q’Quinn, Joel Thurston and Desiree
Williams. . .

The elected board will sit until,
April because of ‘a referendum in
October which changed the tenure of
SGB’s board to begin in May and last
until April.

After Snyder placed the winning
numbers for Unangst and gave a quiet
“congratulations,” Unangst hug-ged
slatemates Norrnarid and Alex, who
alsowon board positions.

“It’s the same amount of intensity
and excitement,” Unangst said. “Just
a different position. They’re all big
positions and you’re going to work
hard to get them.” '

Unangst said that last year he was
at home when he was chosen for the

board Since he was on duty as a resi-
dent assistant in Tower B. '

“This is another step I want to
take with SGB,” he said. “Every year
is a building year, organizationally
and individually. The president has to
build on the projects of the past.”

“Unbelievable,” said Kevan
Washo, who helped Unangst run his
campaign. “It shows that hard work
and a message that’s tangible will
win.” _

Presidential candidate Este Griﬁiﬂranticipates election results.

Hoffman remembered election
night as being “nerve-racking.”

“You’re exhausted. And you’re
either rewarded for everything or just
in despair,” he said.

“We accomplished a lot,” said
board member J o’ie Taylor. “Recently
we did a checklist of all the things we

I ran on [atlast year’s election], and we

either did them or looked into them.”

Taylor said she sympathizes with
all the candidates this year and that
last year’s election was “crazy, just
madness.”-

Taylor added that the current
board leaves a lot of concrete things
that the next board can follow up on.

“Last year’s election felt like it
went on forever,” Snyder said after
the results came in. “I think that this
year a, lot of student organizations
were dedicated on the national elec-
tions- And just like every year, they
had to stand out in the cold all day.”

Snyder also commended the can-
didates for being fair and respectful

While the next board won’t be

Unangst said that he will begin work-

plans for the spring term.

“The [elected] board will unofﬁ-
cially meet before the end of this
term,” Unangst said. “There’s no time
to waste.” .

Unangst said the he will do two
main things. First, he plans to discov-
er how to extract major issues from
the students. Second, he plans on
learning how to most fairly and con-

, cisely place thoseissues up for vote

so students can prioritize the agenda
for the board’s next four months.

Tensions mount

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN

News Editor

At 9 p.m., the board room at the Student
Government Board oﬂice was nearly empty.
By 10 p.m., the audience was spilling into
the hallway.

Candidates for board and the presidency
began ﬁling into the small room just after 9
p.m., as current SGB President Joan Snyder
recorded the tallies from Victoria Hall.

With the smallest voting precinct report-
ing, WPTS station manager and current
board member Dave Lander was ready to
call the election. ‘

“WPTS is expected to declare a winner
in the next ﬁve minutes,” he joked.

Despite Este Griﬂith’s third—place presi-
dential showing at Victoria, slatemates Sara
Dadlani’ and Desiree Williams fared well.
Lee Rutledge, the campaign manager for the
“Knock Down the Walls” slate that the three
women ran under, voiced his excitement.

“All right, all right, we’re moving up,”
he armounced.

Rutledge was just as animated as
Snyder ﬁlled in the results ﬁom Benedurn

“Lee, you have got to relax because you
are gonna make me so nervous,” said
Griﬂith, who was trailing by 34 votes.

“You want some caffeine, Lee?” asked .

Lander, perched on top of a table at the front
of the roorri, offering Rutledge a can of
“Whoop Ass” he’d been diinldng.

A collective “no” rose from the quickly
ﬁlling room. -

By 8 p.m., doors to the SGB oﬂice on
the sixth ﬂoor of the Union were locked.
Members of the Elections Committee, along

with chair Carrie Hoover, SGB adviser-

Joyce Giangarolo, Oﬂice Manager Donna

Mihalik, Snyder and work study students
were among the few permitted inside. Even
current board members were forced to wait
in the lobby or the board room.

Meanwhile, the tension grew along with
the temperature. .

Griﬂith sat in the middle of the room,
her slatemates and supporters surrounding
her. ‘This is the most horrible feeling,” she
said. v
Presidential candidate Mike Unangst
stood in the back of the room, silently. “I’m
a little exhausted,” he said.

As Snyder emerged, from the counting
station inside the ofﬁce, she expressed her
distaste for the MP3 music provided by
Lander’s laptop.

“These sound elfects are killing me,”
she told him.

VV1th only the votes from the Towers —
traditionally the largest polling place — left,

Grifﬁth closed her eyes and nodded. “It’s
' gonna'be OK,” she said. A

Allan Hollander was as optimistic. “I’m
not nervous,” he said “I did good in
Towers.”

Lander, tallying the votes on his spread-
sheet, armounced relative standings, to loud
cheering for Dadlani, Williams and Jay;
Dworin.

“Dave, are you sure your calculator is
ri t?” asked Taylor, alluding to the still-
undecided national presidential election.

“Jo’ie, this isn’t with the hand recount,”-

Lander said.’

By 9:30 p.m., the room was reaching its
capacity of nearly 50 students. Lander
played “Last Resort” by Papa Roach.

“What is this?” Griﬁith asked. ’

At 9:35 pm, Snyder entered with the
ﬁnal count of the night, followed by Hoover,
Hoover’s “elections burmy” puppet and the

‘rest of the committee, which had spent the

evening tallying 2,195 votes.

Board candidate Rob Brown manually tal-
lied votes on scratch paper. Unangst,
unmoved at the back of the room, remained
close to slatemates Becca Normand and Jeff
Alex.

As Snyder recorded the tallies — begin-
ning with the board ——- supporters, candi-
dates, ﬁiends ‘and current board members
jockeyed for a better view, standing on chairs
or leaning over others. ,

As Dadlani’s 963 total votes were
recorded, Rutledge yelped and pumped his
hands in the air. Grifﬁtlr smiled in congratu-
lations to her running mate. _

The. room erupted in applause for
Normand, who collected the most votes for
board, with 1,084.

“Oh my god,” she said as she hugged
supporters. . .

Board members Diran Adekanye and
Taylor congratulated Williams, who also
made the board with an impressive 1,015
votes. -

Griﬂith relayed the information over the
phone, “They got on, they got on,” she said.

“Congratulations,” Snyder said over the
din. Then she joked,
“We’re _gonria_ have to

“You guys are awesome,” Unangst said,

hands and offering congratulations, along
with Lander. .

Taylor deemed the day a landmark elec-
tion. “Five people of color,” she repeated,
jumping around the front of the board room,
celebrating that the board of eight will con-
tain ﬁve minority students in the new term.

Opinions and alternatives from Towers patio

DAVE HARTMAN

 

Assistant News Editor

Hundreds of campaign ﬂiers circulated through the
Towers lobby yesterday as a steady ﬂow of students cast
their votes in the Student Government Board election.

More than 2,100 students voted‘for the eight board
members and the president who will serve on the board
next semester until a new board is elected in April 2001.

Students assisted with polling machines stationed in
Benedurn Hall, the Cathedral of Learning, David Lawrence
Hall, Towers lobby, and the William Pitt Union, scanning
student IDs and instructing ﬁrst-time voters on how to work
the machines.

“It’s been busy,” said SGB elections corrirnittee mem-

T ber Janice Tobin. Tobin spent much of the day stationed in

front of four voting machines in Towers lobby.

“It’s a fun job,” she said. “It’s interesting when people
come in and don’t know how to vote.”

Senior Gina Dekhtyar said she only had a little trouble

working the machine. ~ -

“I didn’t know you had to pull the lever ﬁrst,” she said.

Though Dekhtyar had some trouble voting, she said
she didn’t have any trouble with her decision to vote for
Mike Unangst for SGB president.

Tori Conadi said she, too, had to work for her vote. The’
sophomore English writing major said her ID didn’t work‘

the ﬁrst time she tried to vote. After a trip to the ID center,
she cast her vote for a board she hopes will accomplish a

“It doesn’t seem like [the current board] has ’ done
much,” Corradi said. She said she wasn’t sure how much
power the board wields, but hopes that this year’s board will
make use of all of it. I

Outside on the Towers patio, candidates and supporters
made last-ditch efforts to convince voters that their platform
was the best. Bundled in coats and gloves, the students cir-
culated ﬂiers, held signs and talked to potential voters.

But one man stood out from the rest. Brandishing a
sign that read, “Vote Skeletor for SGB President,” he
‘approached passersby to put in a good word for his alterna-

tive candidate.
“Because he’s less evil than all the other candidates,”
the ﬂier said. Vikrarn Sundararaman, senior engineering

student. and Skeletor carnpaigir manager, said his candidate
~ was the “people’s choice.” 9

“People are telling me Skeletor is an extremist, and
there’s no way he can win, but all I want for him to do is get
5 percent of the vote so he can get ﬁmding for next year,”
Sundararaman said, poking fun at Ralph Nader’s presiden-
tial run.

Sundarararnan’s jovial campaigning met mixed
reviews. _ —_ ‘

“I-Ie’s trying to make a joke out of student govern-
ment,” said SGB elections committee member Bekah
Kohn. “The student activity fee pays for this, and it’s hard
to get people to take it seriously.” .
Sundarararnan contends that he takes the elections seri-

— ously but engages in a yearly election joke to lighten the

tensions. He said he did not vote for Skeletor. ,
“I voted for Este [Grifﬁth],” Sundararaman said. “I
thought she got screwed over last year.”

tions. Although this is a good plan
and will make more space avail-
able for student activities, this still
will not be enough. Some organi-
zations do not have the office
space they need because there is
simply not enough within the

. Union.

Oursuggestion is to make the

student union truly a student

union; in other words, the
University should devote all the
space in the Union to student activ-
ities. This means that most of the
non-student offices-would have to
be relocated to other buildings on
campus. Although these offices do

. serve useful purposes, they would

be better located elsewhere.

Career and Placement Services
is not a student organization. Since
it serves mostly CAS students, the
University should move it to
Thackeray Hall. That way, many
students will have their academic
and career advising in the same
place and could register for classes
there as well.

Also, because the Counseling
and , Sexual Assault

services to students, they would be
better placed in the Medical Arts

Building on Fifth Avenue with ,

Student Health. Mental and physi-
cal health are clearly linked, and
this would make delivery of these
services to students much more"
efﬁcient for both the University
and for students.

The Study" Abroad , and
Semester at Sea ofﬁces. should be
moved into the Masonic Temple.
They need more space because
they are becoming cramped in the
Union. The Masonic Temple, how-
ever, has a large amount of space.
Additionally, it is a beautiful build-
ing that will suit these two offices
very well. _

In fact, to make things more
efficient, all ﬁnancial aid should
be located in the Masonic Temple
so that students will not have to
run all over campus to pay their
bills.

The offices that should move
are all certainly useful, but stu-
dents would be better served if
they were in different locations.
Just by freeing up this office space,
student organizations will be better
able‘ to achieve their goals and the
student union will truly be a stu-.
dent union like it is at other

. schools.

The real issues that matter

There was a time, not long ago, when I
thought I could never tire of political debate, but
ﬂiat has passed. Although I care a great deal

about politics, a combination of personal ttnmoil -

and just plain weariness of the same old argu-
ments has rendered me unable to think about all
this serious sniff anymore. I want to think about
the simple stuff. I carmot listen to any more talk
of the Supreme Court, taxes or voting. If you
want to know my position on “important issues,”
here goes:

I Iamanti-caralarrns.AsIwrite

sixth ﬂoor of Holland Hall serious-

throw, you . go” rule. On Fifth
Avenue, a car alarm has yelped all evening long,
as ‘it did last night and the night before.
Particularly, I oppose the type of car alarm that
changes every few seconds, making half a dozen
different armoying sounds repeatedly in succes-
sion. Luckily for Residence Life, I could never

. throw anything far enough to hit the offending

car (which, by the way, is a blue Jeep for those of
you who believe in vigilante justice), so this
forces me to continue following the rules.

I am pro-Minesweeper. This game, which is '

automatically installed on most computers with
Windows, is essential for any college student. I
play it instead of studying on a regular basis, and
it shows: My fastest time at this point is 180 sec-
onds. Minesweeper challenges ﬂie mind more
than other popular games like Solitaire since it

. has a mathematical basis. I believe that all peo-

ple, young and old, should learn to play this
game if they haven’t already.

I am also for Chip’s Challenge and am
incredibly interested in ﬁnding out if there is
actually an end to this game. This summer, I
played Chip’s Challenge a great deal, and
although I do not remember exactly what level I
got to, I know it was well over 100.

I am against shirts that say, “Boys Lie.”
Although I agree that boys lie, I also believe that
girls lie. People lie — often. I want a shirt that

says, “People Lie.” On the same note, I am for ’

homemade shirts that say things like “People
Lie” or other puzzling slogans such as “I don’t

know, ask Mary” (this, by the way, was an obvi-
ously homemade shirt that a high school friend
found at a thrift shop and wore often despite hav-
ing no idea what it meant). I. should also add that
I am generally against lying. _

I am for the listening of the left side of the
radio. In other words, I am against any radio sta-
tions that aren’t situated on the left side of the
dial. The farther to the right the radio station is,
the more likely it is to be incredibly crappy. All
' of the really good, somewhat under-

ground stations are bound to be
under 94 on the radio dial. For
instance, Pitt’s station WPTS—FM
(which I am very much for) is 92.1.
The other good stations are 91.3
WYEP-FM and Carnegie Mellon’s station at
88.4. ‘

I am anti-sickness. I believe that all people
have the right to breathe through both nostrils at
the same time. I support the washing of hands
after going to the bathroom and at other various
interludes during the day. Nevertheless, one
should say “Bless you” or an equally polite
phrase after someone sneezes, and never, under
any circumstances, should one say “Don’t make
me sic ” instead. This is rude and insensitive.

I support Sesame Street, Blues Clues and the
Teletubbies. I accept all of these television shows
as viable sources of entertainment As a lover of
the surreal, these “educational” children’s shows
delight me. Similarly, I wholeheartedly endorse
watching “The Wizard of Oz” on a weekly basis.
The bizaneness of this ﬁlm never ceases to enter-
tain me or ﬁll me with childish glee. I believe that
any self-respecting individual knows the last
words of the Wicked Witch of the West: “What
a world, what a world! Who ever thought a little
girl like you could destroy my beautiful wicked-
ness?’..’

politically minded as myself must allow herself a

Apologies from a Palm Beach County voter

I have been a Pitt student for four
years. In those four years, nearly every-
one I have met has asked me‘ this ques-
tion: “Why the hell did you leave
Florida for Pittsburgh?”

Well, I hope the recent election
coverage has answered your question.
Being that I am a voter from that area,
I feel the need to explain the problems
in my home county, Palm Beach, and
apologize for them.

You see, in Florida there are many
things on which we pride ourselves:
beaches, good weather, models, Disney
World, swamp hicks, stupidity and
voter fraud.

Voter fraud is in fact a proud
Floridian tradition. For example, in the
last mayoral election in Miami, it
seemed that the dead residents of a cer-
tain district crawled out of their graves
and into the voting booths. The election
was, of course, later overturned.

Stupidity is a Floridian tradition as
well. It’s not something genetic to
Floridians, and it’s not something in the
water. Rather,’ it has to do with the fact
that “most of the residents of Florida
possess brains that have gone well
beyond their recommended mileage.

These are the people who have

trouble putting on matching socks in
the morning and schedule their days
around when they have to take what
pills. They eat dinner at 3 p.m. —— the
early—bird special. Then they drive
back home at a speed of 10 mph in the
middle of the road with their turn signal
blinking the entire time.

Once they get home, they LEE
tune in for “Matlock” and
are in bed by 7 p.m. And»
their vote matters just as
much as yours or mine —
and now our nation’s future depends on
it.

Let’s clear up some things’ about
the role Palm Beach played in this
year’s election. The ballot was not con-
fusing —— for intelligent people. There
is a clear arrow and a distinct hole sig-

nifying where people should indicate I

their votes. But we’re talking about the
residents of Palm Beach -—— namely,
elderly retirees who can get confused
very easily and carmot handle breaks
from their routines very well. So for
them, it seems -that the ballot was
indeed unclear, and in this tight elec-
tion‘ that’s important.

Consider that 19,000 votes were
thrown out because of the ballot, with

  

another roughly 3,000 votes going to
Reform Party‘ candidate Pat Buchanan.
Think about that —— 3,000 votes for a
man who some have likened to a Nazi
in a heavily Jewish-populated area.

‘Good 01’ Pat didn’t break 1,000 votes

anywhere else in the state; Obviously,
.there was a problem.
Now I know

in the past Florida has had

STEIN ._voting problems, and argue

- that the ballot was approved
by a Democrat who then mailed a copy

a of the ballot to voters in thatcounty to

prepare them.

Let me respond by saying it doesn’t
matter who made and approved the bal-
lot — the people still had problems.
And unless things in America .have
changed, it’s the people’s opinion. that
matters. As far as Florida’s voting
problems in the past — well, the 1996
election didn’t hinge on 300 votes.‘
That’s why’ nobody cared until now?
And,as a Palm Beach voter, I never got
a sample ballot. A

What should we do next? After all,
this is the tightest election ever. The
discounted votes in Palm Beach
County could‘ have made a world of

Republicans 'will,,argue that

difference to either candidate. In the
fraudulent mayoral election in Miami,
a judge redistributed votes to the other
candidate based on the voter makeup of
the area in question. This seems to be a
feasible option for the presidential
election.

The other more unlikely option is a
re—vote, something that appeals to
many seniors in the area. After all,
they’re used to sending things back to
the kitchen if they’re not _“just right.”

While the Gore campaign tries to
uncover every legal loophole to get a
re—vote and the Bush campaign tries to
hike the ball before the Democrats call
for an instant replay, all eyes are turned

to Florida. Meanwhile, the residents of V

Palm Beach are protesting at the court-
houses, Waving their canes and oxygen
tanks high. ,‘ .

So as a registered Palm Beach
voter, let me apologize one more time
to Pitt and to the rest of the nation. And

let me also say that I will never move «

back to Florida. '

Lee Stein does not even plan on return-

ing to Florida when he is out looking for *

early bird specials and basing his
schedule on his medication.

“New Paintings by
Michael Lotenero”
La Fond Galleries at

Tuscany Cafe

Through Dec. 15
431-3337

RYAN ANDERSON

Staff Writer

Michael I.otenero’s work is derivative.

In the post-modern world of contempo-
rary art, that’s not surprising —-— all artists are
inﬂuenced and often appropriate the styles
and imagery of their predecessors. However,
Lotenero’s work looks almost exactly like
that of Jean-Michel Basquiat The imagery is
borrowed The iconography is borrowed
The artistic stylings are bomowed All that
are Lotenero’s own are his editing of
Basquiat’s incendiary statements and his
choice of very nice frames.

Immediately, one must give credit to

feeling that the paints are more natural than

Iotenero’s abilities of  He recre-
ates much of the feel of Basquiat’s work
with beautiful earth tones juxtaposed
against saturated pigments that evoke a

other painters’ are. The colors have the
impression of stains on the paper rather
than a foreign, unnatural coloring placed
on top of the paper.

His shapes and ﬁgures have a loose
ﬂow to them, creating beautiful organic
shapes, referencing Jean Dubuffet and
Pablo Picasso with their primitivism.
What Lotenero has done is bor-
row the format of these ear-
lier paintings and remove
all of the politics, remove
statements altogether, and
leave intact all of the aes-
thetic elements that make
the pieces pleasing to the eye.

Lotenero has created some
beautiful paintings — that is not to say that
they are great paintings, or even good. They
look good, but these looks are deceiving.
Within the context of contemporary art, his
paintings are Pat Boone covers of an Elvis
songs. It may be catchy, but it’s watered
down, and when compared to the original,
loses its impact

 

1 Basquiat’s work was
poignant and political, a scathing

attack on American racism, as well as many
other issues. Lotenero has co-opted the
craftsrparrslrip but none of the artistry, in an
attempt to create paintings that are unobtru-
sive, that will ﬁt well with someone’s Pottery
Barn decor and Banana Republic wardrobe.

times must create works with the hope of

wonderful job of this.

People want art that looks like art they

the design of their living rooms. This latest

interesting exposition of the complexities

Think of your most vivid memory. Do
certain images stand out? Are some colors

more brilliant than others‘? Etching artist »

Leonard Leibowitz creates works the
color of memory.

Leibowitz, who has displayed his

work in Pittsburgh before, returns this
month to show off new work at La Fond
Galleries on the South Side.

His new work involves a departure
from traditional methods of ink applica-
tion by hand to application by computer,
producing beautiful, rich and watery col-
ors.

Etchings are
made by coating
a-' metal plate,
which is usually
copper, with
acid-resistant

Although this
exhibit lacks a title,
its theme seems to
begmemory and its
contortions and
transformations as

Leibowitz utilizes this method throughout
the exhibit. In addition to manipulating
color to stimulate stirred memories,
Leibowitz also incorporates ghostlike
images into his work, as in “Never a Day
Goes By” and “Your

the plate is ready
to be used for

Leibowitz’s   I -
traditional etchings take on a quirky mod-
em twist when he colors them by comput-
er. His use of deep, yet ﬂuid, color con-
trasts with his old-fashioned etchings, all
of which are smaller than a sheet of note-
book paper.

templatively in the
foreground. Behind

memory, "a woman

children frolic in the brilliant turquoise

by computer.

The contrast of the past and the pre-
sent embodies the essence of memory, and

ﬂoat above his head. Deep indigo, blue
and bright green combine to develop a
sense of darkness and ambiguity. '

An etching is essentially a print block~

from which many more prints can be
made. Leibowitz, however, allows only 20
prints to be made fro_rn each block to
ensure the integrity of them. Technically,
each print is also an original because each
one is slightly different. -
Just like a memory.

The Pitt News

Merging spaced—out styles with
down—to—earth lyricism, Atlanta’s
Outkast have consistently stepped out-
side of rap’s boundaries to explore
more diverse realms of music.

After reinventing them-
selves three times with-
out missing a beat,
they do the same
for album No. 4,
Stankonia.

Rather than 
toy with the present
trends of simplistic,

' bouncy production, they resurrect

the soul that exists in the music of
Prince, Sly and the Family Stone and
J imi Hendrix and lace it with a hip—hop
edge.

This is accomplished without the
aid of samples. Every vibe is recreated
through live instrumentation and pre-
cise arrangements, giving each song a
familiar yet unique quality.

While not having a defined sound
could hinder a listener’s experience, the
changes work to perfection as -the
Hendrix inﬂuenced energy of
“Gasoline Dreams” is contrasted by the
mellow emotion of “So Fresh, So
Clean.” Big Boi ﬂexes his player per-

Andre 3000 waxes poetically on the lat-
ter as he hides out for two weeks in an
attic with a girl who is “so Anne
Frank.” ' '

The thief—in—the—night tales on “Red
Velvet” serve as a cautionary sign to the
materialistic. Big Boi is the anchor,
keeping the song on the street, while
Andre lets loose with out—of—this-world
P—Funk style singing, complete with
vocal distortions.

On “Humble Mumble,” their per-
sonalities pulsate through the speakers
as'Andre takes the song in a totally dif-
ferent direction from Big Boi. The beat
transforms as an old school drum break
increases the tempo to better suit Dre’s
ﬂow. ,

The personal but clever “Ms.

Jackson” is a story about father-
hood that’s dedicated to

‘ their mothers. Big

Boi angrily raps,

‘ “She needs to get

a piece of A the
American pie and

take her bite

.. V out/That’s my

house/l’ll disconnect the cable and

turn the lights out/_She never got a
chance to hear my side of the story/We
were divided/She had fish—fries and
cookouts but child’s birthday/I ain’t

invited.”

Outkast’s strength lies in their abil-
ity to make effortless transitions from
one form of music to the next. Whether
it’s a slow, hypnotic beat like “Slum
Beautiful” or the 155 beats per minute
drum and bass/rock/electronic fusion of
“B.O.B.,” their voices sound at home
on every track.

Consistency through change sums
up Outkast’s winning formula for creat-
ing not only groundbreaking hip—hop
but great music.

' A Iron your ﬂannel, trim up your goa-

Their soundis‘ best described as a
unique blend of pop and grunge,»with
lyrics drawing from Lifehouse’s front
man Jason Wade’s personal experiences
in life and love. . T A to _
The California-based band, consists
of 20-year-old Wade onvocals and gui-

tar, Sergio Andradeg’ on bass, ;

Mathis on a guitar and Rick
Woolstenhulme on_ drums. The four-
some began recording tracks for the
album as far back as 1997.

This album is exceptionally good,
especially for a debut. It has truly
touching lyrics matched with some
great hooks. The first track, “Hanging
by a Moment,” is a pop-inspired love
song that has the potential to be their
break-out hit. The quiet and reﬂective
“Trying” is a definite highlight on the

p  album.

Wade’s lyrics. He demon-
strates true talent through-
out the entirealbum, allowing
each listener into, the recesses of his
innermost thoughts. '

Lifehouse also breaks from the
standard guitar/bass/drums formula. We
hear the incorporation of such instru-
ments as a viola, an accordion and a
Variety of string instruments in the song
“Quasimodo.”

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
   

Other highlights include
“Everything” and “Sick Cycle
Carousel.” Both take introspective
looks at life with emotionally charged,
inspirational lyrics and well-suited
musical accompaniments.

Lifehouse is a ﬁrst—rate band that
you will undoubtedly be hearing about
soon and for years to come. Grab it
before they become too mainstream for
their own good.

Bruce Homsby C ‘

STEVE MOGG

Staff Writer

It’s an understatement to say that
Bruce Hornsby’s firstfever live
recording, Here Come The Noise
Makers, was well worth the wait. With
a 15-year career that is most noted for
his live concerts, 'it’s aston-
ishing that a live

unarguably
proves that he puts
on one great live
show. The only thing_ ‘i
more constant than the sound of
Hornsby’s piano is the emphatic
cheers of the crowd and sporadic
shoutings of “Bruuuuuuce!” present
throughout the entire album.

Here Come the Noise Makers
relies heavily on Hornsby’s dramatic

piano playing. It istfull of improvisa-; j.
tional jams, moving renditions ‘of .

some of Hornsby’s most popular songs
as well as cover songs from his major
inﬂuences. \ lg

Hornsby achieved fame on his
debut album, The Way It Is, which
eventually went on to triple platinum
status and won a Best‘ New Artist
Grammy in 1986. Further collabora-

  
       
   

tions with Don Henley, Bob Seger and

Bela Fleck broadened his fan base.

Here Come the Noise Makers
exposes the -secret to his success —— his
live shows. Recorded at shows
between 1998 and 2000 from a variety
of concert venues 1-— Austin City
Limits, Woodstock‘, ,-Jazz Central +-
Homsby runs the live music gamut in‘
this album. Songs like “The Road Not
Taken” and “Fortunate Son” are quiet
and "intricate, while “Jacob Ladder”
and “Sneaking Up on Boo-Radley” are
fast—paced, funk—induced jams.

He sates his audience’s desire for

his two biggest mainstream hits with

passionate performances of “The End
of the Innocence” and “The Way It Is.”

Hornsby, an apt pupil, covers
songs by the artists who inﬂuenced
him. He plays versions of “Lady with
a Fan,” “Black Muddy River” and a
sample of “China Cat
Sunflower,” all by the

album didn’t hap- Grateful Dead,
3 pen earlier. ‘ with whom
H o r n s b y Homsby brieﬂy

a Lot to Laugh, It
. . Takes a Train to Cry”
is a rendition that would give even the

\

biggest Dylan critic something to

cheer about. V

The highlight of the album is the
10-minute jam session, “Spider
Fingers/Tempus Fugit.” It demon-
strates Hornsby’s‘ piano-playing
expertise, while showing off the musi-

cal ability of his backing band.

We all should feel very cheated,
however.Here Come .the Noise
Makers, while a great offering, is still
the only live album from Bruce
Hornsbgy. Before hearing it, you might

not have known how powerful
Homsby’s live’ shows were — now
you do.

Pitt hosted the Big East volleyball
championship tournament last year but
was not permitted to play. They were
edged out of competition, and the team
was forced to sit in the bleachers and
watch’ as Notre Dame took home the
title.

This year Pitt (22-9 overall, 8-3
Big East) goes to Notre Dame to play
in the tourney and try to bring back the
championship. Ranked third in the con-
ference, the Panthers will begin the
two-round competition of only four
teams with a match against Rutgers.

“lt’s an important match, and we
don’t take Pitt lightly,” Rutgers head
coach Ann Leonard—House said of the
match.

Rutgers plays Pitt immediately
after Notre Dame faces Connecticut in
the ﬁrst semiﬁnal. The winners will
then compete for the championship and
a definite spot in the NCAA competi-
tion in addition to the Big East title. ‘

This year’s matchups are pretty
close. Notre Dame plays the favorite,

but the last time the Fighting Irish
played UConn, the game went into a
ﬁfth-round rally scoring competition.
N otre Dame, undefeated in the confer-
ence, will be facing a peaking
Connecticut, which Pitt’s head coach

Chris Beennan said may be up to the _

task.

“Connecticut is playing their best
ball now,” Beerman said.

Pitt will be rematched with a
Rutgers team that won here at the Field
House in four matches last month.
Currently ranked second in the Big
East, the Scarlet Knights plan to focus
on serving and blocking as keys to the
win against. Pitt. Beerman made his
adjustments and feels that his team can
come out with a victory.

Beerrnan said that N otre Dame will
be a tough match for-any team again
this year. They have a corps of talented
senior players, and have won the title

. four of the last ﬁy_._e‘ years. The Irish

also swept the conference last year and
when they played Pitt earlier this sea-
son, they won 3-1.‘ .

Pitt-Temple highlights the non-rivalrygames

There are days when I wish
picking football games was like
picking apples off of atree.

I like Gala apples the best,
because of their fine aroma and
sweet juice. Red Delicious apples
are not bad, but give me a Galaiany
day.

Oh, right.

College football heads into
“rivalry week,” when two teams
that hate each other immensely
square off in hopes of not only beat-
ing the other team, but embarrass-
ing it to no end. A

I was 4-3 last week and am now
33-40 for the season.

Granny Smith apples are pretty
good, too, but...

Pitt (-9) at Temple

When I perused the Web sites of
the top sports news companies,
their bowl predictions caught me
off guard.

First, there was Cnnsi.com that
predicted the Panthers would make
the Insight.com Bowl against Texas
A&M.

Then I hit Espn.com and
Cbs.sportsline.com and no Pitt in
the Aloha Bowl. There was no Pitt
in the Music City Bowl or the
Insight.com Bowl. Ah, shafted
again.

Then my eyes nearly dropped
out onto the keyboard as I saw the
Panthers heading to the Gator Bowl

in both predictions against
Clemson.
ESPN and CBS had .Notre

Dame, Miami and Virginia Tech all
in the Bowl Championship Series,
so the Gator Bowl would get the
next pick from the Big East.

(Rose Bowl implications on the line.

Trophy games this weekend
include the Brown Bucket (Indiana at
No. 17 Purdue), the Land Grant
Trophy (Michigan State at Penn
State) and the Brown Jug (Kentucky
at Tennessee). These matchups are
always hard fought as another “I” or
“P” link is put in the Brown Bucket
chain, another MSU or PSU plaque is
put on the black granite Land Grant
Trophy, and another UK or UT
scratch is put on the Brown Jug.
Winning or retaining the trophy will
be the only thing on players’ minds
this Saturday.

Storied tradition and longtime
rival games this weekend include the
Iron Bowl (No. 18 Auburn at
Alabama), Stanford at California,
Southern Cal at UCLA, No. 6
Washington at Washington State, and
North Carolina at Duke.

The games may have lost a little
charm because of disappointing sea-
sons, but there are still major brag-
ging rights on the line. A year’s worth
of bragging rights is a prize that all
these schools players cherish. Out-
gunned or not, the underdogs will let
it all out against their hated rivals.

Rounding out this rivalry week-
end are in—state rivals No. 25 South
Carolina at No. 16 Clemson, Illinois

at No. 23 Northwestern, Akron at
Kent and Idaho at Boise State.

But since we’re stuck here in
Oakland and can’t get to any of these
great games, the only way to truly
enjoy massive amounts of televised
college football is to experience it all
at once. If you live in the dorms or on
campus, you’re almost ready to go. To
set up this football extravaganza,
meet with your football friends that
own televisions and decide whose
room is the best place for all of you to
watch the games. - '

~Once the number of televisions
has been decided, go to Radio Shack
and buy the appropriate number of
coaxial cable line splitters,
female/female connectors and any
extra cable line. Have them hooked
up and dialedin by noon on Saturday
and let the fun begin.

I had four televisions set up last
year in a Forbes-Craig living room.
This may be tough to pull off in a
small. Towers pie wedge, but a four-
television wall will do nicely on
Saturday and give you ample, cover-
age of the great football action.

New quarterback looks to knock
off Hurricanes

Following a 31-12 victory over

task of playing No. 2 Miami
‘Saturday at the Carrier Dome.

The 5-4 Orangemen are looking
for a win, which would make them
bowl eligible. ,

“He has a strong arm, is an

Morgan moves up in the record I

books

Saturday’s. 35-7 win over Pitt for
the Miami Hurricanes, was marked
by new records for linebacker Dan
Morgan.

Morgan was named Big East Co-
Defensive Player of the Week after
recording 20 tackles. Morgan also
became the all-time career leading
tackler at Miami, besting other well-

Miami is now No. 2 in the Bowl
Championship Series, but that might
change after No. 3 Florida State

While the Hurricanes are now
ranked second, a win by FSU might
drop the ‘Canes, despite the fact that
