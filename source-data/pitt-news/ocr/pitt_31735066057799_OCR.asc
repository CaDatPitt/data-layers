By Brian Estadt
For The Pitt News

In a speech in the
William Pitt Union

Assembly Room last night,
black author Dr. Cain
Hope Felder urged blacks
to discover their history by
searching for themselves
rather than relying on
Eurocentric scholars.

Sponsored by the Black
Action Society, Felder
kicked off Black Week ‘94
by speaking to a crowd of
roughly 150 people.

White Europeans took
history, especially as it is
presented in the Bible, and
twisted it to suit their
needs, he said.

In an attempt to pirate
the achievements of
African culture, Felder
said, Europeans altered the
Bible while translating it.

SGB looks

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

Students who use the
Internet computer system at
Carnegie Mellon University
are now being censored, and
‘Pitt students could be next.

But Student Government
Board member Todd
Neufeld and other Pitt stu-
dents are trying to prevent it
from happening.

At last night’s SGB meet-
ing, Neufeld mentioned that
CMU released a press report
last Friday saying they are
going to block the use of
pornography over Internet.
The pornography includes
all sexually explicit stories
and pictures.

Neufeld said Pitt is con-
sidering doing something
similar to CMU, and he
expressed the impacts that

the Bible, black roles have
been diminished and
altered, he said.

“I will challenge you
here in this lecture hall to
show me how a Charleton

Taylor could indeed sur-
vive in these areas even
with a [very effective] sun

“We hope you have ideas for us too,

Candidates for governor, state assembly
and U.S. Congress were asked their plat-
forms on four issues: scholarship and loan
allocation/payback, student and national

Neufeld said there was an

where the plans for all of

cussed. Though plans for
university housing were
presented at the forum,
Neufeld said they were not

Pitt offers self-defense training for credit

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

Like a box of chocolates," you never
know what you’re going to get in an
area as diverse as Oakland, which is
one reason awareness and self-defense
should be an important part of student
life.

Campus police officer Curtis Smith
teaches a course in the “Buy Yourself
a Minute” method of self-defense at
Pitt.

“We touch all facets of dealing and
going against assault from making you
street-wise to giving you exposure to

I [self-defense weapons],” Smith said.

Aside from the campus police and his
courses here at Pitt, Smith is also a
chemical spray instructor and a state
instructor for training police cadets.

The BYAM method not only teaches
students how to handle an assailant, but
also how to avoid a potentially danger-
ous situation in the first place.

“When you say ‘self-defense’ people
think of just the physical aspect,”
Smith said. “They don’t really look at
the psychological aspect or the street-
wise aspect.”

One of the ways in which Smith
teachs his students about the streets is
by bringing in individuals who can
warn them about the workings of

gangs.

“We as police only have a limited
amount of information. The local com-
munity has even more. So I go right to
the community and I bring a person in
who understands all of the gang jar-
gon.”

Another method of teaching Smith
uses is “live street assimilation,” in
which students have to go out into the
street and have to deal with surprise,
set-up situations.

One of the main focuses of the course
is the use of language in avoiding dan-
gerous situations.

“Language is very, very potent.

Pitt center researches new ways to help students learn

By George Cann
For The Pitt News

Whether it is math, science or
English that students may be strug-
gling in at Pitt, the Learning Research
and Development Center is here to
help.

For over 30 years, the center has
been a breeding ground for the
knowledge of students.

The LRDC houses more than two
dozen senior and research scientists
engaged in about 45 research pro-
jects. Studies are conducted at the
LRDC to enrich student thinking by
using the traditional methods of edu-
cating.

“Some students, especially highly
motivated ones with plenty of support
at home, have always managed to
learn in traditional classrooms,” said
Kate Maloy, director of communica-
tions at LRDC.

For many years, researchers at the
LRDC have conducted studies in cog-
nitive processes involving learning,
remembering, understanding and rea-
soning.

“Researchers have shown repeated-
ly that students must actively con-
struct and continually adapt their
knowledge,” said Maloy. “Students
must take responsibility for building
the knowledge and skills they will
need throughout their lives.”

The center comes in close contact
with teachers to adjust the differentia-

tion of classroom situations.
Researchers want to express the con-
ceptual facts of how much a student
knows.

“Researchers cannot design truly
effective instruction without relying

on teachers’ expertise regarding the

day-to—day complexities of the class-
room,” said Maloy.

Some researchers work closely with
teachers to design new instructional
methods to apply in the classroom.

Other researchers become involved
in education policy efforts, profes-
sional development programs for
teachers or efforts to measure the
educational performance and identify
the means of improving it.

The LRDC has many methods that
are used in evaluating students.
Maloy said the New Standards
Project is devoted to the very com-
plex challenge of redesigning school
assessments, or testing methods.

“Many new forms of assessment
are based on student portfolios or on
performance tasks,” said Maloy.
Student portfolios are collections of
various work over extended periods
of time.

Metacognitive process is a form of
self-monitoring and assessment, an
overview of one’s process of learn-
ing. ’

“The best learners engage metacog-
nitive processes. They continually ask
themselves how they are doing, how
well they understand what they are

learning, how they can improve their
understanding and whether the mate-
rials they are using are coherent and
clear or filled with ambiguities, infor-
mation gaps or errors,” said Maloy.

Pitt students like Heather Day work
with schools across the country to
develop an innovative method of
learning. Heather is part of the
Quasar Project at Pitt which works
with middle schools in Atlanta,
Philadelphia, Milwaukee and other
cities.

“Our projects focus on minority
school students who have deficient
skills in algebra studies,” said Day.
“The center assesses the students’
comprehension on exams to ensure
that they learn the necessary concepts
needed.”

Researchers at the LRDC are
known and recognized both national-
ly and internationally for their studies
of learning and cognition.

“Some of the important things that
the researchers do are: they edit or
publish in major academic journals in
their disciplines, they serve on
regional and national boards, panels
and commissions, they host confer-
ences of distinguished scholars and
education practitioners,” said Maloy.
“They also direct programs of nation-
al significance.”

The New Standards Project, co-
directed by LRDC Director Lauren
Resnick, works with several states
and school districts to create new

ways of supporting and assessing
much higher levels of student perfor-
mance in public schools. LRDC
Director Robert Glaser chairs a
National Academy of Education
panel to evaluate the utility and
impact of a state-level National
Assessment of Educational Progress.

The LRDC has many apprentice— .

ship programs available for students.
One, called Sherlock, uses an on-line
tutor—software program to teach tech-
nicians—in-training how to detect
repair bugs in the complex electronic
system.

“LRDC’s projects in education for
the workplace aim to develop effi-
cient means for the students to
acquire both knowledge and the abili-
ty to reason with it so that, as work-
ers, they will be able to adapt readily
in changing, sophisticated, high-tech
environments,” Maloy said.

Researchers at the center come
from a variety of disciplines includ-
ing cognitive psychology, computer
science, anthropology, philosophy,
linguistics, law and other professions.

“The overall goal that the LRDC
wants to possess is to continually
improve our understanding of cogni-
tive processes and to use research
findings to improve American educa-
tion in schools, on the job and
through policy efforts,” Maloy said.

The Learning . Research and
Development Center is located on
O’Hara Street.

Board member Julie
Crowell mentioned a differ-
ent type of building that will
soon be built on campus.

As a member of PACWAC,
the Provost’s Advisory
Committee for Women’s
Concerns, Crowell said, “We
are defining the Campus
Women’s Center.”

Though Crowell said they
are waiting for funding and a

location for the center, she

said the center will not have
the problems that the last
women’s center did.

“Pitt had an Oakland
Women’s Center, but it was
dropped for budgetary rea-
sons about 10 years ago,”
said Crowell. “It was sup-
ported by outside university
funding, and when this fund-
ing was dissipating, Pitt
pulled its money away.”

Interested

Crowell, a presidential
candidate in Wednesday’s
SGB elections, has focused
on other women’s issues at
Pitt, such as the creation of a

. Women Studies major.

Though Crowell was once
the sole female presidential
candidate, SGB president
Ross Pasquale announced
that Dina Scardamalia will
be running as well.

But Scardamalia is a dif-
ferent type of candidate, a
write-in candidate. As a
write-in candidate, she did
not have to meet the same
requirements of the regis-
tered candidates, except for
the minimum QPA.

However, her name will
not appear on the SGB elec-
tions poster, and she is
unable to participate in the
presidential debate tomorrow
at 7 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Kurtzman Room.

°From page 1
Bible, Felder said that blacks “need to be suspicious of
the ways they interpret history and ancient texts.”

“If you are waiting for the white publishers to pre-
sent to you a fair and inclusive bible, you have a long
wait indeed.”

Felder’s most recent book, The African Heritage
Study Bible, gives a black interpretation of the holy
book, one which he says has been questioned for not
having white people portrayed within it.

' His response to critics is that his is the only all—black
Bible, whereas there are numerous versions which give
solely white depictions of history.

“If you are willing to darken some of your pictures,”
he said. “we’ll be more than happy to lighten some of
ours.”

He also said that racial prejudice didn’t exist until
1492, when blacks were needed for labor.

In order to subjugate Africans, Felder said, the
Europeans created a myth of black inferiority. ’

Prior to the discovery of the Americas, there was no
racism because Greeks and Romans repeatedly went to
Africa and took pieces of its culture, he said.

“Egypt and Africa emerged as an ancient breadbasket
of the world.”

Unless blacks take themselves seriously, no one else
will, he said. No one is going to help them, aside from
themselves.

“We are expecting charity in a nation which again
shows it has no charity  there is no mercy and charity
in this land.” To back up his point, Felder cited_exam-
ples of blacks being accused of crimes that whites have
committed.

“You will wait a long time for the white repression-
ists to disclose the information  this is information
that must be culled and studied by ourselves,” he said.

And only when blacks look beyond the history of
their slavery will they be able to look to the future.

“We are a people of the day before yesterday,” he
said. “We are a people of the day after tomorrow.”

The GRC conducted the
survey as part of its voter
awareness drive. The com-
mittee visited about half of
the Freshman Studies classes
and informed students about
the elections and the elec-
toral process.

The committee is com-
posed of 18 active members
and is designed to act as a
liaison between the student
body and local and state gov-
ernments.

It is responsible for an
annual luncheon, known as
the “Legislative Luncheon”
for student leaders, faculty,
SGB members, state legisla-
tors, governors and members
of Congress. It also makes a
lobbying trip to Harrisburg
or Washington. _

“We need to represent the
student body more, and the
student body doesn’t even
know we are here. If it is a

concern of the students, it is
something we are going to
take care of,” said Leibowitz,
explaining the GRC’s role.

Other concerns for the
GRC include voter awareness
and registration of students
to vote.

Julie Crowell and Andy
Wuertele are two SGB mem-
bers who have brought
“Register Once” to Pitt. In
one week, the program regis-
tered SO0 students.

The committee currently
has a petition drive to allow
students to register to vote
when they register for class-
es. Leibowitz said many con-
servative candidates are
opposed to the idea.

Many candidates stereo-
type college students as lib-
eral. In addition, only a small
percentage of people from
the typical college age group
vote.

‘‘It will make [registering
to vote] so easy for the stu-
dents, and it will increase

Defense

°FrompageI

Language can create and
constitute the molding of
your perception, of attitudes.
A lot of times, words can put
you into a [situation] where
you are more defenseless,
simply because you talked
your way into it.”

Sexual assault has recently
become an issue on the Pitt
campus, which is another
reason for learning how to
defend yourself.

“We have a high percent-
age of women taking the
class,” Smith said. “It shows
a lot of courage and confi-
dence, but also a lot of
smarts on the women’s
behalf. Guys think they
don’t get assaulted, but
believe me, we transport
enough of them to the hospi-
tal. They are not always as
street-wise as they think, or
as good fighters as they
think.” 9

Though many of his stu-
dents are women, Smith said
he believes self-defense is
something everyone should

know.

“Training is essential
whether you are a layman, or
whether you are a profes-
sional in this particular field,
in combating crime,” he
said.

The goal of the course is to
make students more percep-
tive of their environment so
that they are less susceptible
to danger.

“You have to understand
the opponent, just like if you
were going into a match or
a football game,” Smith said.
“You have to be able to
understand the opponent
and understand the defenses
and offenses you will be
going up against. The more
exposure you get, the bet-
ter.”

Smith said he wants ‘to
make sure his students can
handle high-risk situations,
and situations where the risk
is unknown.

“Always be alert,” Smith
said. “Always be aware of
you and your surrounding
environment.”

Perversion of justice

Last week, former Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin won $5 millioniin
punitive damages from the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel which hosted
the 1991 Tailhook convention where she was groped by drunken
aviators. This is in addition to $1.7 million in actual damages
she-was early awarded from the Hilton and an undisclosed
amount from the Tailhook association.

These decisions are an absolute perversion of justice. For the
Hilton to be forced to pay $6.7 million (and this is only the first
of 12 lawsuits) is ridiculous. The cited reason was the hotel’s
failure to provide adequate security. First of all, this was the first
incident like this in the 19-year history of the Tailhook conven-
tion. Apparently, the security was adequate in those other years.

Secondly, this was a military convention. Now let’s think
about this for a second. A military convention. Since when does
a hotel need to provide extra security for the military? And any-
way, how many conventions have you been to where there have
been security guards roaming all the halls?

The people at fault in this case were the aviators who molest-
ed Coughlin. It is unfortunate the incident happened, but to
penalize the hotel is ridiculous. Even if there was not adequate
security, $6.7 million is an undeserved penalty. It is hardly the
hotel’s role to baby-sit a bunch of military personal.

Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Punish the
perpetrators not the hotel.

Cameras for OJ.

Judge Lance Ito decided yesterday that he would allow the
news media to continue its televised coverage of the O.J.
Simpson trial. There was speculation that he would close the tele-
vision eye because of news leaks on the DNA testing which had
been televised. However, Ito said he was convinced the televised
coverage of the court proceedings was not the cause of the leak
and that there was no precedent to disallow televised coverage.

The Pitt News concurs with Judge Ito’s decision. For all of its
tabloid-like appeal, the Simpson trial is a landmark case in a
number of ways and has attracted the eye of the nation.

One could argue the continued televised coverage of the trial
will create a circus-like atmosphere and disrupt the search for
justice. Unfortunately, the trial is already a circus, and television
coverage will not make it any worse. Indeed, the denial of cover-
age could very likely have made matters worse. Interest in the

case would hardly disappear if there was no televised coverage, ’

and sensationalist news coverage, both accurate and inaccurate,
would run rampant. By having everything in full view of the pub-
lic record, there will be no confusion about what is actually going
on. -

Finally, we are rapidly entering the telecommunications age.
The O.J. trial is only one example of the closeness we will have
to the rest of the world. If you don’t like it, then don’t watch.

Jackson '5 reasons for not voting

he main event has
arrived. Today is elec-
tion day. While else-

where you will receive many
exhortations to vote, it seems
the other half ought to have a
say. a

Not too long ago, I got a
swift kick in the shins from a
rather democratically minded
young karate student. The
awful insult I had committed
was telling her I was not going
to vote. Now, she’s not the type
who would accept the standard
arguments for apathy, so I had
to come with something worth-
while to save my shins. What
saved me from further assault
and assuaged my conscience as
a political junkie may help you
when you realize that studying
for that test or finishing that
paper may save your grade this
term.

Now, that last sentence is the
kind of slacker nonsense my
friend would not tolerate. The
strongest argument for voting
is that you pay your admission
price whether you vote or not
(i.e. taxes). Although the effect
votes have at the national level
can be dubious, this election is
even more important because it
is in the off-season. There’s
more local offices up.

So with that, what excuse
does anyone have to not vote?

First, the plight of displaced
people like myself has to be
considered. The hallowed halls
of Pitt are my home for the
duration of the school year, but
my permanent address is sever-
al hundred miles and a few
congressional districts away.
Where is a displaced person
like myself supposed to cast
his lot?

There are issues of impor-
tance in both elections and
both will affect me directly. It
doesn’t seem fair does it?
Maybe folks in my situation
(out-of-state students, and peo-
ple hailing from more than one
fixed address) ought to get two

at , 1‘ 

votes. What about folks like
myself who haven’t been at the
homestead for more than two
months in the past year. I spent
time in New York, and know
that I’d prefer Mario Cuomo to
George Pataki, but maybe a
few weeks in the Big Apple
aren’t enough to deserve a
third vote on top of the other
two I would like. But this
again illustrates another prob-
lem with the way politics runs.

My rather partisan friend
told me that she would be
working the polls and would
show me which lever to pull if
I showed up to vote. Even if I
knew who the main candidates
were, I’d probably end up vot-
ing for a bunch of characters
that I would want in their
respective offices as judges,
dog-catcher and so on if I
knew what they planned to do.
Take the New York races, for
instance. I know about the gov-
emor’s race, and I think Sen.
Moynihan is up for re-election,
but that’s about all. Crime is a
hot topic there, as in most of
the other elections, but to know
who has the most intelligent
solutions, you have to have a
visceral feel for the state in
question. Sadly, I lack that gut
instinct for even for
Pennsylvania, where I’ve spent
the bulk of my recent time.

You can say that the absentee
ballot solves this, but there’s
another factor to be consid-
ered. Never underestimate
human stupidity (which will
probably be all too prevalent in
this election, judging by the
polls) and the power of igno-
rance.

The danger in this is that
people in this situation have an
extremely hard time in keeping
up with the news from both
places. Now, I’ll confess to a
bit of political addiction, but,
hey, I can quit anytime I want,
especially when there’s a 10-
page biology paper due next
week. There is also the fact

 

 

that being distant from the ol’
hometown can put you out of
touch. College is an ivory
tower in itself, so should these
people be given a voice in
determining the fate of the
country?

Ignorance may be bliss, but
sound bites are no way to
determine who ought to run the
country. Since that’s all I’ve
heard in most of the elections
I’ve followed, I’1l practice
what I preach and stay silent
when it’s time to be counted.

So, the ignorant and the dis-
placed have an excuse, but
what about others who claim
alienation from the system?
The indictments of the status

.quo could be arguments
against the vote. The complaint ‘

that the two political parties
are identical is one that seems
to hold a lot of water. Will
Rogers pointed this out to us
back in 1935.

Why haven’t things changed?
Judging by the rabid rhetoric
that is ﬂying around “tax and
spend libera1s,” borrow and
spend Republicans who don’t
pay their bills, but leave them
with the rest of us, you might
have a hard time convincing
people of this one. The third
parties are too close to the
fringe, and there are always
enough chuckleheads to sup-
port the two current candidates
that we can’t just start over
from scratch.

The real way to change the
government is not by voting. If
we really want to send a potent
message, we ought to stop pay-
ing taxes.

So, you don’t need to be both »

ignorant and displaced; igno-
rance alone will suffice. Even
though it may sound like a
lame excuse, not voting is a
democratic option. The prob-
lem with this is that you are at
the mercy of the mob who does
vote.

tor-at-large.

Heisman;

Auburn

Columnist et’s

David take a

Saliba mome
nt and step

out of the norm of talking about
Pitt football, Pitt athletics and
any other sport associated with
this university.

It’s time to look beyond, to
search the horizon for uncom- y
mon angles on common topics.
We can leave the world of the
mundane and the rehashed and
focus on the different.

°Let’s start with one of the
hottest issues in college foot-
ball, the Heisman Trophy.
Controversy, right? The con-
sensus is: give it to quarterback
Steve McNair from lowly
Alcom State or Rashaan
Salaam from No. 7 Colorado.
Forget them both. '

McNair has not been tested
in his career at Division I—AA.
His statistics have been quite
impressive, and though some
are record-setting, they come
against pathetic teams. Give the
Division I-AAteams their own
trophy.

Here’s two and a half words
for the Heisman: Ki-Jana
Carter. The stand-out tailback
for Penn State has proven to be
the premier back in college
football. Take his latest perfor-
mance against Indiana
University, for example. On 20
carries he ran for 192 yards.
Granted, Indiana is not a diffi-
cult task, but what one may not
realize is that most of the Big
Ten teams are underrated.

The Big Ten is loaded with
teams that have the potential to
be ranked in the top 25 in the
nation. Due to the fact that
these teams play one another in
the conference, the record does
not show their ability. What it
shows is the toughest confer-
ence in college football. Six of
the 11 teams in this conference
could possibly be top 25 teams
if they were in other confer-
ences. ,

This leads to the next issue:

0 The world of college foot-
ball needs some consistency,
some rules. Controversy is
inevitable in the current bowl
system — that is obvious from
the past few years.

Let’s dig a little deeper, clip
the weed below the root.
Eliminate Auburn and
Washington from the polls.
Both are on probation, unable
to go to a bowl, and have no
chance of becoming national
champions. So why are they
ranked? They committed viola-
tions barming them from bowl
games. Why glorify them with
national rankings? It does noth-
ing but create confusion and an

Legend Walton building RMC from scratch

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

It is easy to love a game that
rewards your hard work with
big salaries, packed stadiums
and players who are paid to do
what you tell them.

But not many people who
have risen to the top levels of
professional football would be
excited to return to-the gridiron
at the college level, especially

 

However, coming out of near-
by Beaver Falls High School as
a football star, Walton said his

ship school where a football
program did not yet exist.

However, not many people
have a love for football like Joe
Walton and the character to
bring instant success to a new-
born program.

“As far as I’m concerned, the
biggest difference between
coaching in college and the pros
is the budget,” Walton said;
“Wherever you are, you’re
going to be a teacher, that’s the
most important thing.”

Walton, who has led Robert
Morris College to a 6-1-1
record to this point in the sea-
son, is a 1957 Pitt graduate and
probably one of Pitt’s most
famous pre-dental alumni.

“When I was in college, I was
in the pre-dental program. I
really had no idea I was going
to end up in pro football,”
Walton said.

Panthers land Gill in running
for other blue-c ip recruits

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

It hasn’t taken Pitt coach
Ralph Willard long to throw
his new employers’ name
onto the final lists of blue
chip recruits.

Willard has taken Pitt’s
recruiting, which once cen-
tered in New'York, onto the
national scene.

Willard has already gone to
the heart of Georgia and

Louisiana to sign Vonteego ‘

Cummings and Isaac
Hawkins.
Last week, he went to
Washington, D.C. to land 6-
foot—6-inch wing forward
Michael Gill from famed
Dunbar
H i g h
School

“[Gill]

is a

v e r y

g o o d

athlete.
He’s very smooth with great
hands, and D.C. players
know how to play,” Clarke
Francis, publisher of Hoop
Scoop magazine, said.

Gill is the third recruit to
give Pitt an oral commitment
this year, but Willard and the
Panthers are still in the run-
ning for a host of highly-

sought players.

Gill, who has been labeled
a “scoring machine” by some
analysts, averaged 17 points,
nine rebounds and three
assists last year for a Dunbar
team that once produced
NBA stars Reggie Williams,
Muggsy Bogues and Reggie
Lewis.

Willard got Gill, who is
rated the No. 60 high school
senior by Hoop Scoop, to
commit to the Panthers over
nearby Maryland, Miami,
USC and Minnesota.

Pitt has made the final list
of a number of blue chip
prospects around the country.
Among those that are cur-
rently considering Pitt is one
of the most hotly—recruited
players in the ‘95 class.
Willard might be fighting an
uphill battle by attempting to
recruit 6-foot-9-inch, 300-
pound Robert Traylor from
Murray Wright H.S. in
Detroit, Mich.

Traylor is very close to his
family, and it would be_a
coup of sorts if Pitt dragged
him out of the state of
Michigan, according to
Murray Wright coach Robert
Glenn.

“It’s gonna be hard to get
him away from this area,”
Glenn said. “I think he’s
gonna stay somewhere near-

by.”

But Pitt is among the
remaining five schools on a
list that once included half of
the civilized world. Traylor,
who is expected to sign in
April, is also considering
Michigan, Michigan State,
Detroit Mercy and
Georgetown. C

Traylor is ranked as the
No. 4 player in the country
by Hoop Scoop and is con-
sidered an inside force.

“Robert is one of the best
in the nation,” Glenn said.
“We haven’t yet seen any-_
body that can stop him. He
can’t be stopped around the
basket unless you foul him.”

Francis said that for Pitt to
sign Traylor would be “a
long shot,” but Francis does
expect Pitt to land 6-foot-.8-
inch forward Andre Howard
from Overbrook H.S. in
Philadelphia.

“They’re pretty strong for
him,” Francis said.

Howard is thought of more
as a power ‘forward, even
though he weighs only 205
pounds.

He is a tough rebounder
whom Francis says is a per-
fect fit for Willard’s system.
Howard, who is rated No. 76,
is also considering Rutgers,
Seton Hall, St. Joseph’s

“[Playing football] was some-
thing I had thought about and
hoped for, because my father
had played and coached in the
pros, but I ﬁgured after college
I’d be a dentist,” Walton said.

It was not to be.

Walton’s two All-American
performances at tight end and
linebacker during his college
career brought him national
attention. Walton was taken
14th in the 1957 draft by the
Washington Redskins, begin-
ning a professional career that
would span 35 years and vari-
ous levels of pro football.

Back to 1993, when Walton
was two years removed from
his career in the pros and
Robert Morris College was
searching for a man who could
build a football program from
the ground up, literally.

When RMC named Walton as
its choice, many were surprised
that someone with such an
impressive resume wanted to
tackle such a project. A
National Football League head
coach for eight years, Walton
had never coached outside the
pros.

“One of the myths I’m look-
ing forward to dispelling is the
difference between coaching at
this level and the NFL,” Walton
said when he accepted the

Doherty stumbles in ITA tourney

Braden Doherty and Brad
Wade, Pitt’s top two tennis
players respectively, had a
rough weekend at Princeton’s

past weekend. -

doubles match against
Temple’s No. 1 team, but lost

was tight, but Temple won
the tie-breaker, and Pitt went
down in the second set, which
eliminated them from the
tournament.

“In the [tie-breaker] we
were trading points until it
was nine all. That’s when
they broke our serve and won
the next point, and they got

    

[the win]. We missed a cou-

ple of easy shots, but they
didn’t destroy us,” Wade said.
The two were disappointed

with their serves but felt they
could have won the match if
they would have returned bet-
ter.

“We tried to mix up our
game plan, but they had an
answer every time. They were
a very talented team and
deserved to win,” Doherty
said.’

Pitt’s No.1 seed, Doherty,
played Miami’s No. 4 seed,

I Woni Rom from Australia,

but didn’t come close to win-
ning. Drawing Miami in the
first round for singles compe-
tition hurt because Miami is
ranked No.1 in the Big East.
Doherty wasn’t worried
when he found out his oppo-
nent was from Miami because
he was No. 4 on the team, but
he proved to be a better play-
er than what he was ranked.
“I can’t get intimidated by
names of people or teams.

Once I’ve played enough

people, I put names behind
me and focus on my game,”
Doherty said.

Doherty realized his weak-
nesses from the match. “I
need to be a more forcing
player with ground strokes.
I’m more of a serve-and-vol-

ley player.”

The ITA Rolex
Championship is set up as a
single-elimination toumament
that allows schools to enter
one or more players. The bet-
ter schools are allowed to
enter more if they choose to
do so. The top-seeded players
on the teams usually are the
ones who compete in the
tournament.

A special exception was
made so Miami could com-
pete in the tournament this
year. The Hurricanes didn’t
compete last year because
their players are at a higher
level than the competitors
that were there. They are
members of the Big East
Conference and wanted to
qualify more members of
their team for the National
Indoors by playing easier
schools in the North.

The coaches at the tourna-
ment are appealing to the
NCAA in hopes of keeping
Miami out next year. There is
nothing that can be done for
this year.

The winners have been
determined, and it’s too late
to change.

additional “What if ...”

-I lied. The last issue to be
dealt with is the status of Pitt
tailback Curtis Martin. Contrary
to what I have tried to do, let’s
step back into the world of Pitt.

We all have tried to philoso-
phize on whether Martin will
turn to the NFL and whether
this would be the right decision.
I would assume that Johnny
Majors and the Panther football
staff hope Martin will overlook
the pros and return for another
season.

Martin needs to prove that he
can play with and without
injury. Since his freshman year,
Martin has been prone to injury,
and thatis not an attribute one
wants to carry into the NFL.
With either decision he makes
there are costs. If he stays, there
will be the question of splitting
time with Billy West.

A month ago, the idea of plac-
ing West and Martin in the
backﬁeld together was initiated
by a writer from The Pitt News,
and I would have to say that is
quite an inviting idea. As a head
coach with not much promise

it’s an idea.

Walton —

°From page 7
RMC head coach position last
year. “Teaching and coaching, it
won’t be any problem because I
feel certain we can attract bright
young men to Robert Morris.”

Building a program means
recruiting an entire team in a
single year, which is tough
enough, but add that this
Division I-AA team would bare-
ly have a suitable practice field
and facilities. Considering that
even home games would be
played on a nearby high school
field, winning seemed like a tall
order, even for Joe Walton.

And, most importantly,
according to RMC President
Edward Nicholson, the college
was counting on Walton to
attract true student-athletes.
Walton himself was an
Academic All-American at Pitt
in 1956.

“Our number one priority is to
attract as many student-athletes
as we can,” Walton said. “It will
take some time and some
patience, but I enjoy teaching
and I enjoy young people. I’ve
never had the challenge of tak-
ing youngsters and getting them
started in the fundamentals of
football.”

And as their record shows,
Walton and his staff have over-
come the obstacles to amass an
impressive charter squad at
RMC, including 65 freshman

Hockey

°From page 7
able to put the Panthers away
until the latter part of the final
period. Until that point, the
two teams had been playing
evenly throughout.

“Last week, we were out of
the game by the second peri-
od,” Panther co—captain Steve
Fisher said. “Today, we played
[evenly] with them for the
whole game. We just played
with more experience today 
we weren’t as intimidated by
them.”

“This week, we were a lot
more relaxed,” Hockey Club
president Matt White said.
“The team is finally starting to
gel.”

Much of the reason for the
Panthers’ turnaround from last
week was the return of two
key players missing from last
week’s lineup.

White, a bruising power for-
ward, returned to add a strong
physical presence to the team
after being out for three weeks
with a broken left thumb. Brad
Rizzo, a lightning-quick
winger and one of the
WPCHA’s most potent scorers,
helped to neutralize much of
Duquesne’s speed advantage
which they used to run over
Pitt last week. Rizzo’s playing
status is still game—to-game.

The return of White and
Rizzo, coupled with a strong
emphasis on backchecking,
improved Pitt’s overall defen-
sive outlook, particularly
against the Duquesne power

and Xavier.

Two other players for
whom Pitt is in the running
are 6-foot—3-inch two-guard
Charlton Clarke from St.
Raymond’s H.S. in the
Bronx, N.Y. and 6-foot-5-
inch forward Duany Duany
from North H.S. in
Bloomington, Indiana.

“What would make it a
great class is if they could
pull off signing Charlton
Clarke,” Francis said.

Clarke, who hails from the
same school as Pitt’s
Orlando Antigua, is rated
No. 13 and is considered a
top—notch three—point shoot-
er.

Clarke will choose from
Massachusetts, Purdue,
Providence, Pitt, Texas and
UConn.

Duany was once a lock
for Indiana, but considering
that he lives five blocks
away from the Hoosiers
campus and Bobby Knight
has never spoken to him,
Indiana has dropped from
the list.

Duany is looking at
Wisconsin, New Mexico,
Northwestern and Pitt.

“Willard is gonna get it
done there in a big way.
Both as a recruiter and a
coach,” Francis said.

“[Pitt] has one of the top
five to 10 coaches in college
basketball today.”

play.

The Panther penalty-killing
unit held the Dukes to one goal
on five power play opportuni-
ties in the first two periods,
while notching two shorthand-
ed goals of their own.

“We worked on a lot of
backchecking drills in practice
this week,” co-captain Mark
Zukowski said. “Guys are
starting to learn where they
have to be, and everyone’s get-
ting used to each other.”

Panther center iceman Bill
Elliott led the team in scoring
with two goals and one assist.
Elliott was Pitt’s iron horse on
special teams, where he
accounted for all three of his
points (one power play, two
shorthanded).

The Panthers put their new
penalty-killing philosophy to
work early, as Pitt received

two consecutive bench minors
at the start of the game for too
many men on the ice.

For the majority of both
power plays, the Panthers
appeared to be the real aggres-
sor, taking the body hard and
often, while denying the Dukes
any real quality scoring oppor-
tunities.

Finally, with 30 seconds
remaining in the second penal-
ty, Elliott found himself on a
breakaway after a loose puck
was cleared from the Panther
zone. Bearing down, Elliott
fired a quick, high shot that
found the back o£..the net, giv-
ing Pitt its first lead of the sea-
son at 1-0.

After Duquesne came back
with two goals of its own,
Pitt’s Steve Fisher took a pass
from Brad McMullen, weaved

through a few defenders, cut

right to left into the slot and
slid the puck under Duquesne
goalie Jeff Thomas to tie the
score at two.

- In the second period, with
Duquesne leading 4-3, the
Panthers capitalized on yet
another shorthanded chance.
After the Panthers’ penalty
killers had drawn the
Duquesne point men out of
position, the puck came loose
to Elliott who led a two—on-
none charge with Dan
Woodbury trailing. With the
puck, Elliott tried to fake out
Thomas with a move across
the crease, but Thomas stacked
the pads and was able to stop
the initial shot. Woodbury,
however, was right there to
pound in the rebound, and Pitt
went to the locker room tied at
4-4 after two periods.

Unfortunately

for the

Panthers, what did not hurt
them earlier in the game came
back to bite their heads off in
the final period. *

After the two teams traded
goals to start the period, Pitt’s
third penalty for too many
ducks on the pond opened the
ﬂoodgates. Three Dukes goals
in just over a minute slammed
the door shut on Pitt’s first
chance for a victory.

“We have nobody to blame
but ourselves [for those penal-
ties],” Fisher said. “The play-
ers have to be held responsible
[when] one guy comes to the
bench and two jump off.”

The Panthers take their first
dip into WPCHA waters next
week, when they face division
rival Carnegie Mellon on
Saturday at Golden Mile Ice
Arena. Game time is 10:30
p.m.

-From page 8
recruits on the team, 19 of
whom start.

The team, with a record of 6-
1-1, is currently leading the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference and is in strong
contention for a berth in the
NCAA Division I-AA ECAC
Bowl on Nov. 19.

One of Walton’s moves as
head coach was to name his
son, Joe Jr., as quarterbacks
coach.

The move completes three
generations of coaches in the
Walton family. Joe’s father,
Frank “Tiger” Walton, was the
Steelers’ line coach as well as a
pro player in the 1940s.

Besides coaching, Pitt is also
a tradition in the Walton family.
Frank and Joe were both All-
Americans football players at
Pitt, while Joe Jr. came here in
1991.

He graduated in 1994 and
now studies in the RMC gradu-
ate program, in addition to
serving on his father’s staff.

Walton said a major factor in
taking the coaching job was the
location.

 

“I was born and raised in
Beaver Falls. I love this area,”
Walton said. “My wife and I
have a house here, and we’re
very happy.”

When Walton moved from
the Pittsburgh area for the ﬁrst
time in 1957, it was to play for
the Washington Redskins for
four years and then the New
York Giants for another four.

 

In his eight years as a tight
end, Walton made 178 recep-
tions, including 26 touchdowns.

He moved on to scouting and
coaching for the Giants until
1973, when he went back to the

Redskins as a coach and later
offensive coordinator.

In 1981, he was named offen-
sive coordinator for the New
York Jets, and he rose to head
coach in 1983.

Ask Walton whether he miss-
es the packed stadiums, the
constant media exposure and
the big money glamour of the
NFL, and you’re sure to get a
quick reply.

“Actually, I probably enjoy
this atmosphere more [than the
NFL]. This whole experience
has been a pleasure,” Walton
said.

“Right now, I’m where I
want to bef”

Walton also served as the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ offensive
coordinator in 1990 and 1991
under head coach Chuck Noll, a
job which concluded 35 straight
years in professional football.

But was it the last time we
will see Joe Walton’s name in
the NFL?

“Right now, this program is
my main concern and I enjoy it
very much,” Walton said. “But
two or three years down the
road, who knows?”
