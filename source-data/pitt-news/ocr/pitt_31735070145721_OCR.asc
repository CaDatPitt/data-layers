The cases against three teenagers
charged with the fatal shooting of
a Pitt law student will go to court
soon, and pending decisions will

have a large effect on all three.
It is likely that all three teen-

agers arrested this summer in
connection to the death of Pitt
law student James Wallmuth III

‘will be prosecuted as adults, York,

Pa., authorities said, though a gag
order on the youngest defendant’s
case will keep much of that trial out
of the press. . .
That is the usual process fo
murder cases involving minors,

said Kyle King, an administrator '

in the York County District Attor-
ney’s office. King said he “put the
kibosh” on the murder trial as soon
as he learned the age of the ﬁrst
and youngest defendant, 15-year-
old Jordan Wallick.

Two 18-year—olds from York,
Joshua Edmoundson and Kenneth
Santiago—Curet, were also arrested

Reports of rowdy South Side night life
have spurred City Councilman Bruce

Kraus to push for political action that

will deter outrageous behaviorinthe
popular Pittsburgh party spot.

That push involves what Kraus
is calling a “holistic solution” that
addresses a series of concerns with
night life in the South Side, including
irresponsible party behavior and a
lack of transportation.

The South Side has seen only
slight ﬂuctuations in crime over the
past few years, according to Pitts-
burgh police crime statistics. In 2009,
1,207 crimes were reported to police
inthe area. I ,

Kraus has written a 95—page re-
port speciﬁcally addressing concerns
about the South Side. The report,
called “Inviting, Safe and Cohesive:
A Proposal for the Management of
the South Side Using Responsible
Hospitality Practicesj’ examines
successﬁil strategies other cities
have implemented to create a safe
night life.

City Councilwoman Natalia Rudi-
ak supports Kraus’ initiative. She said
that Kraus’ plan does not require any
official policy changes to take effect
because the City Council doesn’t man-
age the Department of Public Safety,
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl does.

Implementing the plan will re-
quire collaborative action from the
Council, city department heads and
Ravenstahl.

Pizza Sola uses such specials to try
and draw students into their store.

“-Ifyou’re not advertising to stu-
dents you’re losing out on a big mar-
ket,” said general manager Stephen
Ewing-

Eyring’s restaurant offers $7 piz-
zas to students after 8 p.m. He said
that creating deals for students is es-
pecially irnportant for pizza places,

. which are abundant in Oakland.

The Milk Shake Factory on the

_ South Side also offers a deal to start

. off the year. Every Wednesday, the V

milkshake and chocolate provider
offers a milkshake happy hour for
students.

“We ran it duringthe summer and
it was a huge success,” owner Chris-
tian Edwards said.

“We’ve decided to keep it around
especially for the college students...
so thatthey’llvisit us throughout the
rest of their years here,” he said.

Snaring a purchase through‘
student discounts does not always
ensure a lifelong customer, though.
Freshman Katie Shockey is nowwary

of deals targeted towards students
after a computer purchase cost more
than she had expected.

Shockey calculated that she ended

up paying more using the student A
discount than she would have at the '

original price.

Although the initial price was
lower, “you end up paying more
because [the computer company]
added extrafeatures you don’t_: need,”
Shokey said. _

One reason stores try to attract
studentsto their establishments early
is that students often form loyalties

Case could go to juvenile court

Shooting 4 1

Camacho said Wallmuth was
making a phone call on a bench
outside a popular downtown York

' tavern when a group of people ap-

proached him and asked for mon-
ey. Wallmuth apparently told the
group that he didn’t have any, and
one of them turned and shot him
shortly after 11 p.m.

Witnesses observed a male
wearing a red shirt and dark shorts
running from the scene south on
Grant Street and then east on Mar-
ket Street, Camacho said.

Medics transported Wallmuth
to York Hospital, where he was
pronounced dead from a single
gunshot wound to the back at 1:31
a.m.

All three teenagers face charges
of criminal homicide, criminal
conspiracy to commit homicide,
robbery and criminal conspiracy
to commit robbery, King said, and
it is up to a York juvenile judge to
decide if Wallick will be charged
as an adult.

It is unclear who is representing

the teens, and attempts to reach .

their families were unsuccessful.

If convicted of ﬁrst degree mur-
der as adults, the three could face
life imprisonment or the death
sentence under Pennsylvania
law, according to Families Against
Mandatory Minimums’ website, an
advocacy group for fair and pro-
portionate sentencing laws.

The decision to try Wallick as
an adult would have a huge bearing
on the 15-year-old’s future, accord-
ing to the American Bar Associa-
tion’s website; , ,

“Juvenile offenders do not com-
mit ‘crimes,”’ the website reads.
“They commit delinquent acts,

some of which are acts that would .

constitute crimes if committed by
an adult. - .

The trial phase of a juvenile case
is replaced with an adjudication
hearing that determines whether
the child is delinquent.”

The sentencing for delinquent"

juveniles is characteristically more
focused on rehabilitation than

‘ punishment, the website reports.

King largely agreed with the Bar
Associations assessment.
“I can’t really speak speciﬁcally

about this case, but in a violent
crime like this we always prosecute
to the fullest extent judging by the
nature of the crime,” King said. “In
the case of the youngest defendant,
the trial will start before a juvenile
judge, where the defense attorney
will push for juvenile court.”

“This type of decision is about l

more than evaluating the maturity
level of the defendant. There are
many contributing factors,” King
said. “We’re going to weigh the
crime against the capacity for re-
habilitation. Obviously, the age is a
huge factor in that consideration,
but we prosecute the same way we
would any other homicide.”

King said Wallick already ap-
peared in juvenile court, but the
case has been postponed until
late September. He said the two
18-year—olds, Edmoundson and
Santiago-Curet, are old enough
to face adult charges.

The pair were still waiting for
their preliminary hearing as of last
week, King said. Court dockets in-
dicated that the hearings are slated
for late—September. I

Other students ﬁnd that their

“If different places advertise bet-

nior Caitlin Cleary said. '

Red Oak Cafe on Forbes Avenue

- uses its image as a health—conscious

restaurant to rope students in, one
employee said. Red Oak employees
try to establish a welcoming atmo-
sphere and quality service to keep
them coming.

“Because we’re an independent
business we don’t have acorporate
sponsor ‘to send us extra food for
give—aways,” restaurant manager
Max Malle said.

Instead of drawing people inwith
free food, Red Oak relies on its exclu-
sive menu options, such as the Oaﬁe,
an oatmeal smoothie.

The well-known Pittsburgh Stop
outside vendor, which operates on the
comer ofForbes Avenue and Bigelow

Shops vie for students  

Boulevard, gives out discount cards
and coupons good for 10 percent off
each purchase untiljuly 2011.

Chas Bonasorte, the Stop’s owner,
said this is the second year he has

offered the discounts and that they

are an effective way to bring in repeat
customers who might otherwise not
have visited as often.

“I’m getting the same girls’ faces
10, 15 times a year,” he said.

While business owners also plan
ahead for when students aren’t
around. Some places do this by mak-
ingtheir specials available to the com-
munity beyond students.

“In general business owners un-
derstand that in Oakland you have a
dramatic change in foot traﬂic over
the year and they plan for that,” said
Georgia Petropoulos Muir, executive
director of the Oakland Business Im-
provement District

Sorrento’s Pizza owner Aaron
Price ﬁnds that by offering pizzas for
$5 after 8 p.m. his business can main-

tain popularity with both students

and Oakland residents alike. .
“If you can tap into Oakland resi-

, dency, when students go, we still have

people down the street coming in,”
Price said. I

Kraus, locals disagree

South Side 4 1

But the mayor has voiced disagreement with
Kraus’ plan. His spokeswoman,_]oanna Doven,
told the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette that the admin-
istration has already provided garbage recep-
tacles, deployed police bicycle patrols and taken
other measures to help the community. _

Kraus has also invited local universities, in-
cluding Pitt, to join in the cleanup effort. It was
not immediately clear what role, if any, Pitt will
play in the cleanup.

Pittsburgh police ‘officer Christine Luffey,
one of the 35 officers who patrols the South Side
during weekends, called the situation “pretty
ba .”

Public urinaﬁon and propertyvandalism are
just a few of the illegal activities she encounters
while on duty.

Most of the culprits are college students,
she said. ,

But blaming students for the current state
of the South Side isn’t a part of Kraus’ plan to
renovate the Pittsburgh neighborhood.

“This is not about enforcement and'punish—
ment. It’s about compliance,” Kraus said.

He also emphasized that students are not
the sole instigators of rowdiness in the South
Side. Calling college students a “huge positive”
for the city, he instead blames a lack of political
foresight. A

As Pittsburgh transitioned from a steel in-
dustry to a society supported by education and
medicine, no action was taken to prepare the
city for the inﬂux of thousands of students.

“We are reaping the effects of that,” Kraus
said.

Bar owners in the South Side disagree.

Richard Cupka, owner of Cupka’s Cafe on
East Carson Street, believes that Kraus is “sen—
sationalizing” night life in the South Side.

“Do we have problems at two in the morn-

ing? Yes. But allwe need is one ortwo more cop
cars,” Cupka said.
Kraus doesn’t believe that the problem is
so easily solved. _
“People want to think that there are very
simple answers to complex issues. What is

-40 police officers going to accomplish that 35

hasn’t‘?” Kraus said.
Rudiak added that giving more police of-

ﬁcers to the South Side wouldn’t come without '

a price.

“For every public safety resource that’s being
utilized in the South Side, that means less police
officers on the streets of Oakland, or Carrick,
or any neighborhood,” Rudiak said.

Billie Daft, an employee at Green Front Inn,
doesn’t see the South Side that Kraus has de-
scribed as having a “party time atmosphere.”

Daft, who resides in Mount Washington,
said that the behavior in the South Side isn’t
restricted to that area, calling it “just normal
drunkenness.”

“Anywhere there’s bars, it’s the same atrno—
sphere,” Daft said.

Krista Laurent, a 12-year employee at Cupka’s
Cafe, said, “We don’t have any problems.”

Kraus disagrees, challenging anyone who
doesn’t believe his portrayal of the South Side
to come into his ofﬁce Monday mornings and
listen to residents report about “the carnage of
the weekend before.”

What happens inthe South Sidehasareputa—
tion that reaches all the way to Oakland.

Peter’s Pub barman Ben Salem refuses to go
to the South Side. 1

In Salem’s experience, one of three things
will happen if he makes the journey past Bir-
mingham Bridge.

“I’ll lose my wallet or phone, get into aﬁght
or get jumped,” Salem said. ﬂ '

For most at Pitt, three yearlsis one too few

Thinking about becoming a super-
hero is apopular way for many West-
ern preteens to spend their time. At
Pitt, ‘our popular pastimeis becoming

“super seniors.” Let’s face it, pursuing

‘ aﬁve— or six-year academic plan is not

uncommon here. Take note: There’s a
good reason why students are adding

. years instead of subtracting them.

Chatham University recently
launched a new three—year Bachelor
program for students who are willing
to take an increased course load in or-

der to graduate early with a four-year
degree, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette. We hope this doesn’t
start a trend.

Pretend forasecond you’re on the
three—year plan at Pitt.

Economically, you can’t imagine
why your choice doesn’t make sense.
Rising inﬂation, increasingly elusive
loans and Pitt’s tuition increases bol-
steryour conﬁdence that making itto
the job game before things getworse
is the right thing to do. However, if

you are afreshman or sophomore and
your ears perk up at the idea, proceed
with caution. .

Intentionally enrollingin atl1ree-
year plan may leave out some crucial
career—building opportunities.

If you choose fewerthanfour years
of school, you close, at least partially,
the window for resume—enhancing
internships and co—ops — opport11ni-
ties that your four-year counterparts
will gladly take full advantage of. Be
not illusioned: If collegewas too com-

petitive for you, youmight consider
not leaving at all.
Don’ttake ourword for it,. See for
yourself. According to the U.S. Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics, the national
unemployment rate is 9.7 percent.
Given the surplus millions of qualiﬁed
job-seekers out there, well—rounded
resumes —- and these days they’re
looking for perfect spheres — are at
a premium.
If you do graduate after three years
with no job and no plans for graduate

school, be prepared to face the harsh
reality of monthly payments from
your student loans.

The student aid website studen-
taid.ed.gov reports that Stafford
Loans must be paid back beginning
a mere six months after graduation,
while Federal Perkins Loans start ac-
cruing interest after nine months.

Some schools, such as the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
have cracked down on students who

UNVCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

So you think you’re hot stuff 

. has a similar phrase for such a situ-

 
   

jacob Brown
Columnist

Long before I discovered things like

beer or the fact that I had an aﬂ1ic- ‘‘

tion known as acute procrastina-
tion, I used to compete in organized
sports.And amongthe many lessons
garnered from winning and losing,
my mom imparted a tidbit that still
resonates with me: Neverbelieve your
own press.
In the olden days I was a rather
cocky schmuck, and I had no reserva-
- tions letting anyone knowit. Needless

_ to say, being somewhat misguided

in my perceptions, I had a knack for
not takingin as much good advice as’
I should have.

Life and athletic activities contin-
ued on inthe same pattern, with what
sometimes seemed like my mom nag-
ging at me. Not much really sank in
until afterl had made it to the middle
schoolstate wrestlingtoumament my
eighth grade year. A

I went into the tournament with
a top seed, and the people who are
apparently skilled in guessing such
things projected that I would place
ﬁfth in the state in my weight class.

But, the supposedly predetermined"

outcome didn’t materialize. My
weekend became something of a
personal version of the Pitt—Utah
football game. ’

After getting knocked out of
the tournament early in the second

day, I watched the rest of it fromthe ’

bleachers. . _ . j
The experience stung for a while,

  ..._.,,l__2.,t4tIeszer1tiIa11lyﬁgt1red9utwhathad'

happened: I hadn’t listened to any of
Morn’s ever—offered words ofwisdom
thatweekend, nor had I taken a single
piece of advice from my coach. Nota
one of ’em.

My coach told me not to look at
polls or online forums forwhat people
might be saying about me. But like
those scenes in movies when one
character tells another not to look
down and the latter inevitably does,
I did.

I got caught up in the hype of my
own success —— without a doubt, a

I good way to lose one’s composure.

In a more recent example, after

, spending this past summer bugging

all of the right people, Ifound myself
in a position to accept afairly presti-
gious internship. Iwas both humbled
and excited, not only becausel could
learn more about the profession I
want to go into at a high—proﬁle place,
but also because I wouldn’t have to

. spend my upcoming winter washing ~
‘ cars outside like I did last year.

My roommate offered to sit down
with me to go over the company’s
products and services so I could make
a good impression. He sounded more
excited about the opportunity than I

was —— and Iwas pretty excited.

But since my middle school real-
izations, I’d learned to keep my busi-

. ness tomyself.

_ I’m not usually one to quote the Bi-

ble, but I really can’t put my thoughts g

to paper any better than by borrow-
ing 1 Samuel 2:3: “Talk no more so

exceedingproud1y;’letnotarrogancy _

come out of yourmouth.” .
‘ . Luckily for anyone not well-versed

palatable and contemporaryjay-Z_

‘K?’ a

ation: “Made men don’t make state-
men .”

I’d trust what he has to say. He is
“Hova,” after all.

Unless you’re in a job interview or
other similarsituation, there arevery
few reasons to boast obnoxiously.
And there are even fewer reasons
to get caught up _in any unnecessary,
unwarranted hype.

Having written for the school
newspaper for a while now, I’ve said

i things that have been received with

outpourings of both praise and out-
rage.

With the exceptions of extending
thanks to people who have supported
me and the time when I jokingly asked
out a girl who wanted me ﬁred for
some comments I made in a column,

I’ve ﬁgured keeping my own counsel V

isthe way to go.

I’ve modeled my approach oil” a
guy who _went'much farther in the
sport ofwrestlingthanlever did-— a
guythat beat the snot out of me twice
in high school — Eastern Michigan
University’s Mike Miller.

When I. recall the details from
tournaments we were both at, I re-
member that he would pace around
hours before his matches, never
taking off his headphones. At ﬁrst,
I thought he was one of the most an-
tisocial people I’ve ever met.

For a while, I thought he 

have been like Warren, the brother
with disabilities from “There’s Some-
thingAbout Mary.” But it turned out
neither was the case. He just tuned
everyone out and went about win-
ning. " '

Imagine your friend is irritatingly

anybody drinks tap water.

You ﬁnd this trait ofhers particu-

pristine Little Miss Sunshine, hap-
pily splashing about, decides she’d

her ideas still have the same logic
behind them.

This is the problem that occurs
when everybody focuses on hypoc-
risy asthe crown jewel of political
scandal. It might feel validating but
most often ends inaspiral of personal
attacks. Ifpublic policy is supposed to
be about ideas and not people, point-

really prove anything except that the
person is,.well,-hypocritical.

Look how right this makes you!
She’s been preaching about Pine—Sol,
lecturing on Lysol, and sermonizing
about sterilizingforyears, but doesn’t
even follow through herself. The fact’
that she. can’t even abide by her own
behavioral code shows that the code
must not actually be correct. ' ’

Butdoes it really? This is a real ,
—.- pardon my Palinism — “gotcha”

* moment, an embarrassing gaffe and

naked display of hypocrisy. But it
doesn’t say anything’ about the truth
regardingbeing clean. 1
After all, her reason for being so
concerned with cleanliness has not
changed. All her aesthetic and health

‘motivations are still perfectly valid.

She might have some moral faults,
she may place her own bodily urges

above her  world view,   _ _ T

that Al Gore is hypocritical, maybe
even invalidate his suggestions, but

Judging by the fact that he came in second
place at the 2009 NCAA Division I ﬁnals to an-
other guy that beat the snot out of me back in
high school, I’d say his strategy worked.

success need not be ﬂashy or highly publicized.

People inthe powerﬁil mindset we're more likely

When you win an election, which is some-
times the adult version of a high school student
council popularity contest, or have high ratings
or just feel morally superior, you are in that
powerful mindset. Senators start committing
tax fraud while preaching about the virtue of
paying taxes, etc.

All this is just human nature. That doesn’t
mean it is OK, but people should stop the dis-

nothing to do with policy, and are things that

ART

Buddhism and Expressionism intersect

Artist’s Ellsworth Avenue exhibit inﬂuenced by aspects of Eastern religion and an abstract art movement

Merritt Wuchina
Stajfwriter

Mandalas & Deities
Mendelson Gallery

l 5874 Ellsworth Ave.

Runs until Oct. 2
Wednesday— Saturday
12-5.p.m.

. 412-361-8664

At ﬁrst glance, the inspirations
for Harish Sa1uja’s art in the
Mendelson Gallery might seem
contradictory.

Buddhist mandalas derive
from a long tradition of highly

Harish Saluja:

symbolic art. The outer circles
represent gates to reach the cen-
ter, a palace of meditation.

On the other hand, abstract
expressionism began within the
past 60 years in America as a way
for artists to abandon conven-
tions and instead paint with raw

emotion.

But Saluja explained how both
the practice of mandalas and the
flow of expressionism fit with his
philosophy of “freedom within
boundaries.”

“There are certain things
I would not do, like kill, steal,
cheat or hurt someone intention-

. ally,” he said. “But within those

boundaries I refuse to listen to
anybody. I will make fun of every-
body and ridicule myself. I will
break all the damn rules.” A
Walking into the gallery, one
can see how the two contrast-

ing elements work together. A-

glowing, golden Buddha sits at

the center of a canvas, emitting
a sense of tranquility amidst the
chaos of color that surrounds
him. Nearby, the six points of a
blue Star of David touch the outer
edge of a circle, while a tree ﬂour-
ishes in the middle.

ALBUM REVIEW

Music rocks like
‘5,000 Viking oars’

Patrick Wagner
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Father Murphy

No Room For The Weak
Label: Aagoo Records
Grade: B

, Everyoneloves a nice melody, but when

was the last time you heard music made
up of brute force?

In its press materials, Father Murphy
describes the sound of its new EP as “5,0oo
Viking oars being dipped into the cold sea”
and “5o0 Cherokee drums summoning the
spirits of battle.”In a way, these are some
apt descriptions. b ‘

The EP moves with a densely ethereal
sound that seems to build the musical
tensions of each track and keeps people
listening through various worldly musi-
cal motifs.

Some neo-psychedelic bands’ sounds .

move toward a similar passion for drone
and ’60s rock, but none exhibit the sheer
metallic anguish that this Italian trio’s
tracks exude. .

For example, the vocal style is just plain

creepy, with dueling male—female vocals:
L‘, making what seems like more of a 'siren’s

scream than a musical movement (think
F-Minus slowed down). Similarly, there
are a few elements of black-metal and the
group’s lyrical and thematic ideas move
toward’ many of those sinister themes.

What’s here is interesting, but it will
not be everyone’s cup of Earl Grey. People
"with a passion for post—punk, black metal
or neo-psychedelic sounds should seek out
Father Murphy. 1 I

Father Murphy ’s music lives up to its epic description

    

The Italian band takes on stylese neo~
psychedelic and black metal to create an
album with an eerie sound.

Reporting has its
perks.

ALBUM REVIEW

Reserves mimic The Fray

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ Writer

The Reserves

Life

Label: The Reserves Music

Grade: B-

Rocks like: An upgraded version of

The Fray

The old saying “Don’t judge a-book by its
cover” holds true for CDs as well. The cover
of Life by The Reserves is a bland image of
a road. It hardly stands out on the CD rack,
but when the music playing the tunes are
catchy and fairlylenjoyable. '

The opening ‘track, “Ghost Writer,”
kicks off with some upbeat drums and gui-
tar over what sounds like an organ in the
background. A little bit odd, but it certainly
gives this ﬁrst track a sound that stands
apart from other albums. The track features
lyrics about “not wearing your heart on your
sleeve,” and the “the world not being ready
for your dreams.” Thepsong begs the ques-
tion of what someone wants to be, playing
like a storybook. ~

Other tracks have similarly strong beats,
like “Red Eye.” Not all of the songs feature

organs like the ﬁrst — the album shifts from
organ to piano to guitar. The band show-
cases their mastery of all three throughout
the CD. ’

Vocally, singers Dave Greksouk and Mike
Durham don’t do a bad job. Though they
don’t always enunciate, making vocals dif-
ﬁcult to understand, they aren’t the worst
offenders, by far. Their voices are low and
whisperyyand do an interesting job of set-
ting the mood as they harmonize with the

~ music. .

All in all, these guys know what they’r
doing. So here’s the lesson: don’t judge by
album covers or CD titles.

How not to be a ‘biddie’  

Fashion < 7 I

yoga pants during the school week,_]uicy Couture
velour sweatsuits and Ugg boots. L

As early as Thursday night, biddies can be
seen frequenting the steps by the Pete, heading
to parties and grabbing dimer at Qdoba, terribly
overdressed. However, the biddie phenomenonis
at its peakweekend nights on the 1oAbus. Biddies
runwﬂd onthe10Aintheirmini skirts and high
heels, totingtheir suspicious waterbottles. You’re
notfooling anyone, ladies, we all know that’s not
EX/ian you’re carrying.

' In any case,‘ I’vevisited the issue of the biddie
phenomenon for a reason. I, myself, was once a
biddie. I know it’s hard to believe, but most of us
have alittle biddie ﬁghtingto come out. I reached
my biddie peak during my freshman year.

I’ll be the ﬁrst to admit how easy it can be to
get caught up inthe craze. Your ﬁrst semester of
college entices youwith parties, boys, newﬁiend-
ships and ghastly biddie attire. Itcanbe tempting

to fall in step with the phenomenon, but such a

fate is also easy to avoid. It’s true! By following
a few simple guidelines, you can embrace your
inner biddie while simultaneously allowingyour
style to mature.

Rule number one is to avoid logos. Most of
us have had a Hollister or Abercrombie phase,
but hopefully you grew out of it when you re-
ceived your high school diploma. The excep-
tion to the-rule is what I like to refer to as “the

highly esteemed and occasionally worshiped
fashion gods.” The fashion gods include the likes
of Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Lacoste, Gucci, Burb-
erry, etc. For the most part, newer brands are
those that should be considered suspect ﬁ

Now, on acollege student’s budgetthe fashion
gods are out of reach. But, remember, a stuffed
bank account won’t buy you style. Some of the
staple items in my wardrobe have been found on
shopping sprees to TJ. Maxx and vintage stores.
Go on atrip to your favorite dive stores and outlet
malls and, I promise, you’ll be pleasantly sur-
prised at what awaits you.

At the risk of resembling a public service an— .

nouncement, rule number two is always stay
true to your own personal style. I know you’ve
all heard this before from teachers, your mom
and various members of your entourage —— but
it’s true. Most girls ——and guys — are at their
most beautiﬁil when they refuse to conform. By
no means am I suggesting that you should walk
to class dressed as Lady Gaga, bless her, but don’t
ever feel pressured to dress in a way that makes
you feel uncomfortable.

When a gal feels great in what she wears,
that conﬁdence is exuded from the inside, out.
Always remember, ladies, a happy fashionista
is a healthy and conﬁdent fashionista. So I’ll see

you out this weekend. I’ll be the one with th

impeccable style. , -

After nine years of struggling to ﬁnd a

He earnedhis degree from one of the
most prestigious schools in India, the In-

and Princeton together.”

There, his fascination with art was cul-
tivated through various required classes
in painting, theater and music. He worked
for some years as an engineer, but was
unfazed by his newly acquired material

‘wealth.

So in 1971, he left India for Pittsburgh
where he worked as an assistant publisher

and began an Indian radio program on- -

Eventually, he left ‘publishing and be-

. “I like the idea of the struggle of life,
going through hoops to find internal con-
tentment,” he said.

In some Buddhist rituals, the mandala
is actually destroyed after it is created to
represent the impermanence of life. For
some artists this act would be devastating,

. but to Saluja the philosophy of letting go

is quite beautiful.

“I wish I had the courage of destroying
every painting that I did, but the gallery
would have a ﬁt,-so'I do keep some,” he
said. _ _ I

Along with the maqdalas, he also paints
images of Hindu deities, such as Saraswati,
the goddessof arts and, ,l_,earn;ing.

‘fS_l_1_e is described as a beautiful person,
not because of her looks, but because she
is a beautiful being. That is why I don’t put

‘ features on her face,” he said. “Every time

I need" inspiration I go ahead and paint a
Saraswati.” l l

Although Saluja has an extensive
knowledge of and reverence for the beliefs
of many world religions, he does not claim

‘affiliation with any one in particular.
, “I have a very ‘strong spiritual center, '

but I have trouble with organized reli-
gion,” he said.

Yet he consistently feels drawn to the
image of Buddha -— a—- man who never
made claim to divine revelation, but rather
asked his followers to pursue their own
spiritual paths. , f

“If I have to make an image, I make
man — not god —— sitting under a tree,
meditating on the stateof human affairs
and trying to find some peace and content-
ment in life,” he said. " V

. Despite all of his many accomplish-
ments, Saluja remains humble about the
purpose of his art.

“I’m one of those clichéd people who
thinks you can make a difference in the
world, who thinks you need to give back
and touch lives,” he said. “I know it’s stu-
pid, but what you can do, it’s too late for
me.” I ‘ . '

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ” Writer

The Duquesne Dukes found a way
to stop the Pitt Panthers soccer
team this season: wait for light-
ning. ‘

Ofﬁcials suspended gameplay

between Pittsburgh’s cross-city.

rivals Tuesday night in the‘61st
minute when they spotted light-
ning over the Monongahela Riv-
er. After 90 minutes of ominous
thunder, wild wind and heavy rain,
they ofﬁcially called off the soccer
match. - ‘

Pitt led when the storm rolled
in, 1-0. A victory would have given
the Panthers their ﬁrst 3-0 start

i since 2002, when they began the

year 5-0.

When or if the two teams will
make up Tuesday night’s contest
has not yet been decided. The un-

 ﬁnished game Tuesday “is consid-
” - ered a no contest,” according to

Duquesne’s athletic site.
“If we had played just nine
minutes longer before the delay,

it would have counted as a com-
pleted match,” Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “If you play
70—plus minutes and the game is
suspended,.then the result would
stand. We were really just nine
minutes from a solid win.”

The match began under clear
skies, but by 8:45 p.m., those in
attendance noticed lightning to the
southwest of Duquesne’s Rooney
Field. Soon enough, a line judge
saw the lightning and whistled the
game to a halt.

Players from both teams came
to the sidelines before ofﬁcials
conferred and opted to resume
play. Pitt nearly scored on a cross

- to Sam Luffy when play resumed,

but after just 50 seconds of game
time, morelightning enacted a
mandatory 30-minute delay.

The players never returned to
the ﬁeld, and the storm’s heﬁy
rain hit the stadium by 9:20 p.m.

“According to NCAA rules,
when a game is delayed fo_r light-
ning, the game must be restarted
no more than 90 minutes after the
game would» have ended,” Luxbach-

GREGORIAN RANTS

 

Hope remains for
NFL bottomfeeders

Greg outlines why the NFL’s worst teams could win this year. 3

Greg Trietley
Columnist

 

Tonight, for the ﬁrst time in seven months,
football — real, meaningful, professional
football — will be played, and it will be

. glorious.

Right now, every team stands on equal
ground, tied with a pristine 0-0 record.
Last year’s Super Bowl contenders and
also—rans alike can dream of a great sea-
son. A

Detroit, Buffalo, and other punchlines
might plummet to the cellar before Sep-
tember ends, but for now hope springs
eternal. The losers of the league aren’t
losers yet. -

In preparation for this column, I started
to guess each division winner and write a

A . little about each. The same boring names

came up, though:- the Colts, Saints and
Cowboys. I gave up. There’s no fun in pick-
ing the 10 teams that made the playoffs last
year to make them again this year.

With every team equal today, let’s spread
a little hope around. Cellar-dwellers are al-
lowed to dream a little, too. Here’s how the
underdogs could win their divisions.

AFC East —— Buffalo Bills (ESPN Pre-

~ season Power Ranking: 31)

The'Bills played their last playoff game
against Eddie George and the Titans. N eed—
less to say, they don’t have the winning for-
mula. They do, however, have C._]. Spiller,
who will be the best running back in the

division sooner rather than later. His 31-

yard touchdown run against the Colts in
the preseason became the first Bills high-

light on-SportsCenter I’ve heard of in at
least eight years.

And if the old adage “time heals all
wounds” applies to concussions, the Bills
also have quarterback Trent Edwards back.
Edwards had a winning career record (12-

11) until injuries derailed him last season. 1

Add with the league’s second—best pass
defense in a pass-happy division, the Bills
circle the wagons and shock the world.
AFC North — Cleveland Browns
(ESPN Ranking: 28)
What’s orange and white and ﬁnished

g last year on a four-game winning streak?

If you said Tom Brady eating a Cream-
sicle, think again. The 1-11 Browns said
“no thank you,” to the first overall draft
pick and went on a roll last December,
knocking off the Steelers, Chiefs, Raiders
and Jaguars. '

The Browns brought in Mike Holmgren
a man who wins everywhere he goes —— and
veteran quarterbackjake Delhomme, but
outside of that they don’t have many rec-
ognizable names. Don’t worry about that,
though. The “Mangenius” Eric Mangini
remains coach, and kick returner Josh
Cribbs runs enough punts back to put the
Browns in the playoffs.

AFC South — Jacksonville Jaguars
(ESPN Ranking: 26)

The Jaguars weren’t that bad last year.
Had they not lost their last four games to
finish 7-9, they could have earned a Wild
Card spot. But because fan support for
the franchise is low —- attendance dipped
below 74 percent capacity in 2009 — and
they play in the AFC South, nobody talks
about them.

At 3-3, they had a better divisional re-

Rams will showcase their young talent this season

cord than Houston or Tennessee,
and their losses to Indianapolis
were by two andfour points. They
still have Maurice]ones—Drew’——
that really good running back you
might know from your fantasy
league —— and a very manageable
schedule. They run all the way
into the playoffs.

AFC West —— Kansas City
Chiefs (ESPN Ranking: 27)

Addition by subtraction is a
very curious thing, but the Chiefs
did it last year when they waived
troublemaker Larryjohnson. Not
only didjohnson tweet his way to
a suspension, but he also hadn’t
been useful on the field since
2006.

Many‘ people blamed John-
son’s struggles on his offensive
line, butjamaal Charles went out
and rushed for 658 yards over
Kansas City’s last four games. So
much for that scapegoat. Charles,
former Patriot Matt Cassel and
current super—rookie Eric Berry
run, pass and pick-six their way
to the top of a weak division.

NFC East — Washington
Redskins (ESPN Ranking: 20)

Washington, likejacksonville,
sits at the bottom of a very strong
division. The Redskins, though,
have a ton of talent and finally a
coach who can make it all work.

Owner Daniel Snyder handed
Mike Shanahan the reigns of a
veritable “He’s on the Redskins
now?” roster. Albert Haynes-
worth, Donovan McNabb, DeAn—
gelo I-Iall,Joey Galloway, Clinton
Portis and, yes, Larryjohnson all
call D.C. home this year. Shana-
han will make it work.

NFC North —— Detroit Lions
(ESPN Ranking: 29)

The NFL is a quarterback-led
league, and the Lions have a good
one in Matthew Stafford. With
Stafford, wide receiver Calvin
Johnson and running backjahvid
Best, Detroit will put up points. If
Brett Favre shows his age in Min-
nesota, Detroit can run—and—gun
it into the postseason.

NFC South — Tampa Bay
Buccaneers (ESPN Ranking:
30)

Florida gets all the good stuff:
good weather, the second season
ofjersey Shore and user—friendly

NFL schedules. If I called a team
a cellar—dweller in this column,
chances are Tampa Bay plays
them. The Buccaneers have two
scary opponents: Baltimore in
Baltimore and New Orleans.

If the Buccaneers take care
of business outside the division
and hold their own within, they’ll
blast those touchdown—celebra—
tion cannons in the playoffs.

NFC West — St. Louis Rams
(ESPN Ranking: 32)

Remember when the Tampa
Bay (Devil) Rays were awful?
How about the Chicago Black-
hawks‘? Well, funny thing about
being awful ——— you get the chance
to draft great prospects. Then
those prospects mature at once
and —bam!— playoffs.

The Rams picked first or
second overall in each of the
last three drafts. Sam Bradford
(1st, ’O9) will start Sunday.Jason
Smith (2nd, ’O8) and Chris Long
(2nd, ’o7) will mature before our
eyes this year and —bam!— play-
offs.

At the very least, they can
hope. I

MCT Campus
Sam Bradford, the No. 1 overallpick in this year’s NFL Draft, will
start at quarterback for the Rams this season.

Junior Terry Akpua scored his ﬁrst career
Panther goal in the 22nd minute when a
Dukes defender mishandled a through ball
from Pitt’s Ryan McKenzie. The ball came to
Akpua, who wired the ball into the top right
corner of the net. But because the lightning-
out stopped the game, none of the statistics
count, and he technically remains goalless
for his Pitt career.

Duquesne’s Sean Gardner had a chance
to tie the game late in the ﬁrst half when he
snuck to the back post on a corner kick, but
his redirection rolled wide.

The Dukes dialed upthe offense and out-
shot Pitt, 3-0, in the second half, but the
