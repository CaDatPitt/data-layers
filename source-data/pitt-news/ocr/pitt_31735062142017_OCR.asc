outline is as follows:

Eligible are college students’who

Procedure will be to enlist as a

be deferred provided they main-
tain a satisfactory scholastic stand-

P

The climax to a year of maneuvering and of a\month of

bitter campaigning and mud-

slinging comes tonight when

newly-elected SFA members meet to elect officers for the

coming year.

At 7 :45 o’clock in the Men’s Lounge the first assembly
to meet under “equal representation” will hear/Fraternity
and Independent nominatons for president, executive commit-

tee, and other prized spots.

The most important struggle, of
course, will be for the presidency
of the assembly. Both parties have
strong candidates with experience
as assemblymen. “ s

Both Fraternity candidate Gus
Wilde, C43, PiKA, and Aldo Icar-
di, C43, Independent leader, have
piled up impressive activity rec-
ords. Wilde has been’ an outstand-
ing swimmer this year, PiKA presi-
dent, and is a junior worthy. Icar-
di is president of Panther club,
head cheerleader, ODK pledge,

and is this year’s senior worthy.

At ﬁrst glance, it would appear
that faculty votes would decide the
winne.r, but the reluctance of the
faculty to vote on such sharp is-
sues and the rumoredisplit among
the fraternities changes the picture
somewhat.2Besides the fact that
two or three houses are reported
to be ready to give Icardi their
votes in exchange for a little pa-
tronage, it appears that those fac-
ulty members who do vote will vote
for Icardi.

In spite of the fact that the In-
dependents now have equal rep-
resentation in SFA they will be on
the spot as they have never been
before. With this good chance to
push their program through, they
must do something if they expect
to maintain student interest and,
possibly, to prevent successful fra-.

be allowed to. ﬁnish their educa-
tion before being called to active
duty.

If reservists do not pass the
exam, they have still the qualiﬁca-
tions for aviation cadet training
and will probably be ordered to ac-
tive duty as cadets.

. Eligible for enlistment in V-1 are
boys 17, 18, and 19 years of age
who are enrolled in -the ﬁrst two
years of college or have be-en ac-

two calendar years of college work.

ternity attacks on the status quo.

Student union, lower street-car

rates, co-op housing, or well-laid
plans for these things must be soon
forthcoming.

Of course, besides ﬁghting for
these idealistic planks, the Inde-
pendents will have to pay plenty
of attention to their own political
fences. Defeated candidates will

have to be taken care of, struggles
for executive committee and Men’s
Council oﬂices will have to be
smoothed over, and the engineers,
whose vote really won the election,
will demand and get proper, which
means plenty, representation.

new “people’s choices” are not turn-
ing a deaf ear to the seductive of-
fers of various fraternities.

It is not unknown for leading
Independents to go fraternity, even
after being elected by the efforts
of Independents. As a matter of
fact, at least three leading Inde-
pendent SFA members have switch-
ed afﬁliations in the past. Some
protection, however, is afforded by
the proposed rule that the Inde-
pendents going fraternity lose their
seats as Independent representa-
tives, a. rule which Independents
shall demand be adopted at to-
night’s meeting.

All others will be ordered to ac-
tive duty in an enlisted status (ap-
prentice seaman) at the com-
pletion of two calendar years of
college.

include within the ﬁrst two years:
mathematics through trigonometry,
general physics, and considerable

‘physical education.

Democracy . . .
. “A man who is ‘good enought to ﬁght for me is good
 enough to ﬁght with me.” _. ‘
Two privates of-the 369th Infantry—Negro—were the
:ﬁrst Americans to be decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
‘ 1918: C .
And the Negro messman who “manned a machine gun”
. and ‘fblasted away at" Jap planes” in Pearl Harbor might
have been better trained and knocked more J aps out if the
Navy had not discriminated aganst him; had not conﬁned
him and his fellows to the ll/Iessman Branch. _
The Army discriminates against the Negro by segre-
gating him from White soldiers. .
Now the Council" against Intolerance in America has
- proposed to the War Department that a Mixed Division-—
Colored and White soldiers—be formed as a practical expres-
sion of the democratic belief that all men are created equal.
, \ If this Division is organized it will mean that for the
first time on a mass scale Negroes and Whites will ﬁght and
live and work and die together as Americans. It will mean
that in this division will be visible proof that the US is
‘ﬁghting for democracy for all men.
. It will mean that once and for all the lie that Negroes
and Whites cannot get along together inthe Army, Navy
and Marines will be squelched with proof that they can get
. along, that they can serve as a ﬁghting unit, that they are
‘able and willing to be democrats among themselves.

University, here is a chance to show that they are ‘in earnest.
Here is a chance to pledge your future for a tolerantworld
after the war. I 
We heartily endorse this experiment. 
, In fact we are printing below a form which may be ﬁll-
ed out and returned to the Council signifying willingness to
serve in this division. ~ '

In one corner of the

ing their farewell col-
umns. ’ .
A wee mouse was hunch-
ed behind a coke-bottle
(relic of happier days)
and, remembering the
. mold on his meals, he too
was r writing a ' farewell column.

Nostalgia all over the place. .
As a matter of fact, someone reported that when
he came back to the oﬂice once during the summer,
he found Oscar Sheﬂer. in the middle drawer of a

,desk—writing thousands of farewell columns.

Ah, sentiment, we murmured, and turned back to
our typewriter in which there was an unsentimental
Pitt Town Meeting story. And now here we are-—
never having gone to an ICG convention, never hav-

- ing been crow_ned senior queen, never having played
bridge in the women's smoking room, and withonly
a half-inch or so of activities beside‘ our picture in

the Owl. ’

In the strictest sense of the word, you couldn’t call
us a true collegienne with anything to get wish_v-
washy over, could you? .

Sure you could. A
Our sentiment is only for the News oiticc, and the

‘Hitler mustache wesput on the picture of Paulette

Goddard whoseshapely zform was meant to decorate
the bare brick walls. -

And the dead-pan printer with the ‘cigar in his
mouth who barked , just like an ill-bred terrier every
time we touched the type; and the owner of the
print shop who talked through his nose, and thought
that 19 galleys was “awa-a-a-ata, gaweys,” and called
the News editor “colonel.”

And the time the plaster'e.r‘s coverc<.l a cove in thr-
wall, and reputedly shut up one of our more retiring
reporters, who then became a completely ‘retired
reporter. We hear occasional faint tappings from
that wall.

And one particular buffet dinner, served on the
sports editor’: desk: olives pulled out of the jar with
one’s ﬁngers, milk straight from the bottle, cheese
without bread, mustard without ham.

And the weekly exhibits of the paintings of our
art editor—-he would change the positions of his pic-
tures regularly. . .

And how we learned to switch ads from page

two to page four without the advertising manager
ever knowing the difference.

And frustrated women reporters lighting to get a

’ lock of the editor’s hair from his barber, approxi-

mately once every six months.

Sure we've got plenty to get sentimental about.

No more ﬁghting over the last potato chip after

'he Tuck shop has closed, no more rewriting of item‘s

Only hard-boiled employers, family hints about
marriage, and a generally indifferent world.

we've worked until the watchman -vreproachfully

and substituted hamburgers dripping with onions,
and milk shakes that tasted like isoaprsuds.

    
 

Tough-—sure it’s tough, to leave. We’ve had par-

those who were men enough to live for themselves

follows: A leather medal to Delta Tau Delta. for
taking the biggest ride of them all, and liking it
like men (in some cases).

Top honors go to Peggy Fixel who can really take

, ,-it, and who has been unappreciated by the rank and

ﬁed abilities, and we may take care of that matter
later. , , 0 —
John Brosky wins the honors, with some to spare,
for having the most patience of any man alive. Bill
Riddle takes the nod for playing the best game of
chance. Abe Bluestone for speechmaking. We can’t
overlook Aldo lcardi, Hiram Milton and Jack Brady
who proved beyond a doubt that they know more
about politics than Mansﬁeld and that they know
how to take advantage of the power of the press.

To Jack de Benedictis and Irwin Rosen we award
an autographed picture of William Randolph Hearst.
To John Syka a new copy of “How to Woo.” To Roy
Ruane we send a posthumous medal for clearing

ty to come back and back and back for more.) Alex
Zelenski wins honors for the best driving in the IF
Sweepstakes. (How about Stack on the TPA ﬂoat?

We can’t leave out Edgar “Dead Letter” Jones, for
running ‘faster than a brewery truck horse in the

E. Barrymore at N p
0 In ’The Com ls Green’

“The Corn Is Green,” the Emlyn
Williams play in which Ethel Bar-
rymore has scored the outstanding
success of her career will play the
Nixon theatre for one week begin-
ning next Monday, April 27.

Written partially from the mem-
ories of the author’: own youth, I
“The Corn ls Green” is a tender,

heart warming story of a forthright
English school teacher who at-

tempts to bring the beneﬁts of edu-
cation to I begrimed Welsh mining
‘village.

Meeting with local opposition
from the local gentry and indif-
ferent success with her pupils, she
discovers a spark of genius in a
truculent young miner. Under her
guidance the lad wins an Oxford
scholars-hip.

Miss Barrymore plays Miss Mof-

, fat, the teacher, and Richard War-
ing. plays Morgan Evans, the bril-
liant Welsh boy. Edmond Breon, a
noted English actor, makes his first
local appearance as the Squire-, and
Thelma Schnee plays the Cockn¢Y
girl who gratiﬁies her lust for life

1‘ land.

An exhibit of 20 enlarged ph0t0~‘

including technical details and
phases of the actual work will be
shown in 311 State hall from 8:30
to 2 o’clock today

The photographs are the proper-
ty of the Bureau of Reclamaton,
United States Department of In-

  

nearly at the expense of Miss Mol-
fat’s plans for Evans.

Eva Leonard-Boyne plays a shop-
lifter turned house-keeper and Es-
ther Mitchell and Marcel Dill are
seen as Miss Barrymore’s aides in
her ambitious project.

On Broadway “The Corn, ls
Green” created theatrical history
from its very start. lt was the first
play of English origin since “Jour-
ney's End” to duplicate its London
success in this country. _

Also, the play provided Miss
Barrymore with her longest New
York engagement, even surpassing
the substantial records she had
rung up with “Declasse,”
Constant Wife” and other success-
es to play for more than a year.

When the New York Drama Crit-
ics’ Circle held its annual meeting
last spring, the Manhattan drama
appraisers voted the play the best
of the year by a foreign author.
Lillian Hellman’: “Watch on the
Rhine” was chosen the outstanding
native product.

Gondelman, a member of the de-
bate team, was recently tapped.to

Elected to the vice-presidency
was James Dunn, C43, while James
O’Conner, C44, was installed as
secretary-treasurer.

The principal speaker of the eve-
ning was James B. Blackburn,
LL.M., professor of law, whose
topic was “Military Law.”

Start Wartime Activities ~

Pitt is not the only school that
is on its toes! College papers from
all p{,11‘tS of the nation are report-'
ing war activities and unique ideas
for defense programs. '

At both the University of” Ne-
braska and West Virginia univer-
sity, for example, ﬂying units are

Northwestern university has or-
ganized a regular war council with
representatives from each class as
members. Plans for summer farm
labor have been distributed to all
undergraduates and a project to
save old phonograph records is well
under way. Records have an inc-
reasing value because of their rub-
ber content and students of North-
western. are not going to waste
them. '

Los Angeles City college has a

. Last Monday, if the Japs hadn’t
bombed Pearl Harbor, if the coun-
try and the University were not
striving in their greatest defense
effort, there would have been a
gala opening night at the Nixon
theater.

The curtain would have raised on
the thirty-ﬁfth annual production
of Cap and Gown.

But due to the stringent curtail-
ing of expenses by the University,
it was agreed by Cap and Gown of-
ﬁcials and University authorities to
dispense with the show this year.

Cap and Gowners have not ceas-
ed their work, howeve.r, for, ac-
cording to Dr. John S. Ashbrook,
professor of dental anatomy and

 

ture. Many of the dances were
purely original. There were glides,
buck and wing, high-kick, and a
dozen other varieties. The chorus,
especially the girls, made a hit.”

And later in the article: “The
theater was ﬁlled with relatives
and friends of the Cap and Gown
members and especially students.
There was no lack of Pitt enthusi-
asm.”

That enthusiasm has carried on
through the years to produce bet-
ter and better Cap and Gown shows.
It was during the 1918 show, that
Regis Toomey, now a movie star,

discovered, his talent for acting

Other well-known people have

worked to make later productions
successful. Dr. Benjamin Levant,
brother of Oscar (Information
Please) Levant, wrote the music
for many productions. Gene Kelly
and his brother Fred Kelly, famous
Broadway dancers, received their
early stage training treading the
boards for C & C.

After his graduation Gene Kelly
returned a number of times to di-
rect the club’s musicals. Bob ‘Alt-
man, now doing successful work
as a dance designer and director
for New York musical comedies,

was an old C & G director.

every football game. From the 1910
production came “Hail to Pitt,” and
a later show brought ‘forth the Pan-

tegral part of every student’s life.

And even today another Cap

from a British publishing house

5 Last year, on 39 different college campuses, men were asked for can-
did opinions about clothing styles. This poll, conducted by The Saturday
Evening Post, is being repeated this year for more than reasons of fash-
ion. It should have important usefulness in the national conservation of
cloth and other materials.

Manufacturers. and retailers want to know exactly what kind of
clothing college men like .best—what they ﬁnd most practical. Govern-
ment regulations about clothing make it vital to get such facts in advance.

:Maybe you were one  the 4,179 collegefmen who helped provide C
i . the information last year. Maybe you also saw the Post Portfolio of Col-
: , lege Styles in yourifavorite store when you bought clothes last fall. It

made buying simp1erfor_ a good many men.

Track Coach Carl Olson lliouglit he had walclicd

Johnny Woodrulf, his greatest t1'ack- star and one
by of the greatest runners of all time, for the last time

that day in 1939 when the Pitt team met West Vir-
ginia. That meet marked Long Jolin’s farewell to col-

legiate competition.

But this Friday Coach Olson is going to get a
chance to watch his star again, for Johnny, and
it’; Lieutenant John Woodruff now, will run again
in the Penn Relays. This time, however, Long John
is not running for Pitt but on the Army mile Vela)’
quartet.

The 1936 Olympic champion stands out as the

.greatest half iniler and middle distance runner. In

his senior year in high school he began breaking
state, national. and world records and managed to
compile the most impressive record of any runner
in the world.

In his senior year at Connellsville‘ High School,
Johnnv set a new state, W.P.l.A.L., and Fayette
county record for the mile and placed second in the
Junior Nationals in the mile at Lincoln, Nebraska. He
formerly held the national interscholastic mile rec-
ord and the A. M. A. 880-yard mark.

His busiest year as a runner was his freshman

year at Pitt. He started off as captain and number
one man on the yearling cross country team and
ﬁnished his first collegiate year as Olympic 809-
meter champion. After establishing himself at the
Olympiad in Germany as the greatest middle dis.
tance runner, he went to England where he anchor-

ed a two mile relay quartet that set a world record.

Later in the summer he went to Norway and there
anchored a world’s record Swedish relay team. He
also won the 400 meters in this meet in 46.8 seconds.
His next triumph came in a half—mile race in a tri-
angular meet between United States, France, and
Japan at Paris, and here he also ran anchor on a
winning team of which Glenn Cunningham was a
member.

His sopho-more year was equally distinguished and
he went undefeated in dual track competition.

He further distinguished himself in his junior and
senior years when he continued to break records
and was outstanding in the Penn Relays.

Coach Olson is planning to take eight boys alto-
gether to the Penn Relays. These include the mem-
bers of the mile relay team, Hap Stickel. Al Peretic

climaxing a 97 yard sustained drive
late in the fourth period, g9«Ve the
Blues a 6-0 win over the Whites
last Saturday afternoon in the sec-
ond practice engagement of the
spring season.

Described by coach Charlie
Bowser as a typical intra-squad
game, the contest was bitterly con-
tested from start to ﬁnish. Neither
team showed much in the way of
offensive power, with defensive
strength featured throughout the
game.

' The Blue team, which is the first
string eleven. contributed the only
ccoring threats of the day. A fum-
ble on" the four yard line by ]_31l1
Dutton nulliﬁed the ﬁrst scoring
chance. With ﬁve minutes left to
play in the ﬁnal period the Blues
ﬁelded the ball on their own three
yard stripe and rolled 97 yards to
pay dirt.

Injuries to three players. Joe
Broudy, Jack Duiishan, and Mike
Sotak, show just how hard the
players fought for the game. Brou-
dy came out of the tilt with a brok-
en nose, «Sotak wrenched an ankle
and may have torn a ligament in
his leg, while Durishan also suffer-
ed an ankle injury.

The game left Bowser far from

satisﬁed. He declared, “They ‘ _
haven’t shown, as yet, any timing FRANK

or team spirit necessary for a win-
ning team.” Bowser also stated

By MIKE Hrznmgw

Pitt’.x. x‘:-xi’.-*it_\‘ t2~m‘ii;~; to-ain l.1'a\'el-
ed to ‘{,7(;lL1I'nbu.\.' last. Saturday in
high l1()}',)e;S of opening their season
with a win over a major opponent,
but the Mid-Western ‘lennis power
did not see it that way, and the
Panthm-.< (‘E-lfhf‘ home with a 9-0 de-
feat.

The results are not really as
bad as the score indicates, for the
Trees Gym netters were facing one
of the strongest squad: in the
country. Tennis observers the
country over have agreed that the
Buckeyes have an outstanding ag-
gregation, and the betting is that
they will get no worse than a good
second in the fast Big Ten tennis
race.

All six of last year’e varsity out-
ﬁt have returned, and this in itself
is no little item.

The Panthers, on the other hand,
lost three key men from last. year’s
outﬁt by graduation, and had a
fourth man upon whom they were
counting heavily declared ineligible.
Jack Southworth, former City Boys
Tennis champ, was informed that
he could not compete until. he had
spent a full year at the University.

This means that Southworth, 0.
valuable contribution to any ten-
nis squad, will not be allowed to
compete till the present semester

is over. He spent two years on the
California Junior College outﬁt.
Lost l:‘rom last _vear';s‘ tennis team
are Ceptain Ed Goehring, Franlc
Harmuth and Frank Gaenger.
Pitt opened against the Buck-
eyes with Dick Trimble in the num-
ber one spot. Henry Grance play-
ed number two, and Bill Reece was
in the third slot. These men were
followed by Bob Nix.-keson, Frank
Wynn, and Jimmy Deutelbaum.
In the doubles matches, which
were also lost rather handily to

the Buckeyes, Trimble and Grancei

teamed up, as did Reece and Nicke-

son. The third combination showed
Wynn and Bobby Gaylen.

The Panthers open their home
season this Saturday at the 'ﬁees
court: against Grove ‘City. The
Ci-overs have also lost three men
from last year’: outfit, and the
Panther coaches are conﬁdent of
1 victory.

Returning from last year’s team
are Robert Hulton, George Stecli.
and William Weidler, who will
probably play the number one, two,
and three positions. The other three
players will be chosen from among
Bill White, John McDowell, Arthur
Thompson, Harold Millsop, and

Richard Ely.

A tiny pin-hole in a telephone cable can admit
moisture, causing short circuits and service inter-
ruptions. But Bell System men have found a way of
beating this trouble to the punch.

They charge the cable with dry nitrogen under
prcssure. Then should a leak develop, the escaping
gas keeps moisture out. Instruments on the cable
detect the drop in pressure . . . sound an alarm at a
nearby station . . . indicate the approximate location
of the break. A repair crew is‘ quickly on its way.

To "maintain and improve America’s all-important
telephone service, men of the Bell System are con-
stantly searching for the better way. Pioneering
minds find real opportunity in telephone work. 1

The college recruiting plan for
the Army Air Corps was announc-
ed by Lieutenant General Henry
H. Arnold, commanding “general of
the Army Air forces.

His telegram stated: “The suc-
cessful prosecution of this war de-
mands the creation of an air force
second to none on earth, and this
in turn requires the eventual en-
listment as an aviation cadet of
every young man who can qualify
for service with the US Army air
forces.

“This need is imperative— the
number of those ﬁtted for this ex-
acting duty (is) so limited‘ . . . ”

General Arnold explained that
the new plan of enlisting reserves
“will beneﬁt the young men con-
cerned and their colleges, and also
serve the vital -purpose of insuring
the Army Air Forces a continuous
supply of young men well qualiﬁed
by education to become officers in
all branches of the Army Air forc-
es.” s
