CINCINNATI CO-EDS ,

Its ﬁrst home debate of the sea-

cision vote last Thursday _ evemng
when a Pitt co-ed affirmative team
met a Cincinnati university forensic
squad in Frick Training Soho
auditorium on the giestion, ‘ Re-
solved_ that the nited States
should not -protect the foreign in-
vestments ot its citizens.”

Lillian Domestic-us, Ed. "30, and
Alice 'McAfee, Ed. ’29, represented
Pitt, against Helen Friedman and
Helen Swo er who represented Cin-
cinnati. ‘he Pitt debaters main-
tained tha_t intervention by arms to
pt:-otect private property was wrong

' ractice because it brought about,-

 

 

su ering, misery and a general vio- ‘

Iation of ..the li erties of the na-
‘tives of countries where interven-
tion occurs. The affirmative further
maintained that this olicy. of ag-
ession, is inciting t e hatred of
th Latin-American and European
countries, which hatred would even-
t]al_ly_ leadths’ country into ._war

.The negative’ side inted out‘
that intervention on t e part not
some country is an economic neces-

countries have raw materials which
are needed by other countries of
the world, it is the duty of one
country to see that these products
are provided.-. It also showed. that
intervention to protect private in-

with tradition and with interna-

DR. S. H. GOLDENSON
ADDRESSES CHAPEL

Says “Experiences of Life
‘Have Three Distinct
Dimensions”

“Experiences of life have three
dimensions. A full life is the an_-
swer to the three fundamental di-
mensions of length, breadth and
de th,” stated Dr. Samuel H.
Go denson, of the Rodef Shalom
temple, in an address on “Life’s
Dimensions,”- at chapel service last
Wednesday in Heinz house. _

The simplest and least signiﬁ-
cant of the -dimensions is length,
according to Dr. Goldenson. To
prove his point, he cited the exam-
le of the bio aphy of Mathusula
in Genesis whigh devotes but a few
lines in description of nearly ‘one
thousand years of life.

The second dimension, breadth.
stated Dr. Goldenson, is typical of
pure and intellectual interest--um
concerted, and-undirected. He then
referred to the life of Satan, ac-
cordin to Job, where Satan de-
scribe his life as going “to and
fro and walking up and down.”
“So it is with our ives,” continued
Dr. G.oldenson. “Intellect with no
motive is simply movement. There
is nothing real and permanent in
its signiﬁcance.” I

Depth, the third dimension, is
needed to complete life. In ex-
plaining this statement Dr. Golden-
son quoted from the Psalm of
Life, “Thou are the fountain of
life, in thy light I see life.”
should view the depth of life
under the aspect of eternity. Look
on all human interest under the
aspect of the eternal.”

‘Responsibility, earnestness, sac-
riﬁce make up the spirituality of
religion, without which we cannot
live,” stated Dr. Goldenson. in con-
clusion. “We are dependant upon

0] and related to eve one about us.

We must answer to
our relations.” -
Dr. Goldenson’s address was fol-
lowed b ~ luncheon. Professor
Richard . Underwood of the Eng-
lish department, was in charge of
the chapel. services. Approximate-
ly seventy-ﬁve students attended.

COLLEGE CABINET PLANS
YEAR’S SOCIAL PROGRAM

 

Arrangements for a ‘ leap year
frolic as its third dance of the
semester, and plans for the social
calendar of next semester were com-
pleted éit a meeting of the college
associa ion cabinet Friday.

The Wash-Jeff Nine of Washing-

Plans for next semester include a
formal and two informal dances,
states Robert Roy, ’29, president of
the cabinet. Good music and unique
programmes rather than novelties
and extra entertainment, will fea-
ture the dances, he said. A St. Val-
entine dance on February 21, a
spring formal on March 16, and a
final ance on April 4 constitute the
tentative program.

James A. Patterson, ’30, has been

urer in an internal election of the
cabinet.

By  V. STARRETT

Once again it has fallen to me as
Oldest Living Alumnus to review
the Antique number of the Panther.
Let me say in opening that it
pleases me immensely to note the
way this Hungerford boy is coming
along. I picked him as a comer
way back when l was editor mysell.
The cover of this issue of Panther
amply justifies my first impressions.
Encourage this lad, Walt! He has
“it.”

Art work is good and getting
better every time. l’ve seen more
short jokes and fewer long ones, so
that about balances. doesn‘t it? I
didn't like the Hall of Shame. but
why bring that. as Mr. Moran (or
Mack) says, up. I did like the odi-

From the utmost depths of an-
tiquity down to the hard-boiled re-
ality of the present—-yes, sir, that’s
it, the Antique number of the Pan-
ther.

When we looked up the meaning
of a “college humorous magazine"
in Webster's unexpurgated we found
that it meant “a conglomeration of
things to laugh at planted under an
illustrated cover." But this issue
never let us get past the cover. Pan-
ther in his zeal made us fall Into
hysterics over the funny pictures on
the cover. We must admit that
Hungerford is a good artist.

Panther must enjoy being difler-
ent. His usual policy is to clutter
the pages with good illustrations
and supplement them with fair edi-
torial matter. But this time the edi-
torial material provides the saving

LIBERAL CLUB PLANS 0RGANlZATl0N MEETING
FRIDAY; NAME THREEMEMBERS oN coMMITrEE

 

To organize Pitt's ﬁrst. liberal
club, a tentative committee‘ whose
main purpose, is
open-mindedly but to reach balanced
judgment on pressing social prob-_
lems,” will meet inroom 325, Alumni
hall Friday. Harry Weiss,-,Col."'29,
Pittsburgh, will act as chairman» of
the meeting. . .
The general committee, —consisting“
of ‘Herman Recht, Ed. ,’28, Clairton;
Helen Cashdollar, Col. ’28, Pitts-
burgh; Harry, Weiss, Col. ’29, -and
Irene‘ Ravitch," Col. ’29, Pittsburgh,
has arranged‘ deﬁnite plans of. or-
ganization to be presented, before
the‘ group on Friday.

The desire for a liberal organiza-
tion at Pitt which has been preva-
lent for some time, was stimulated
by a speech given by Dr. Norman
Thomas last Friday in Heinz'House.
Dr. Thomas, who is director of the
league for industrial democracy and
prominent in the ﬁelds of sociology,‘
economics, and politics,‘ believes that.-
a college education is'.beneﬁcial only,
when it‘ brings ,out those qualities
that will beneﬁt..huinanit socially.

"Dr. Thomas: in his‘ . ‘ 9117051,-

liberalism, stated ‘tha_.t- ‘poop 'e qei.".~'
-tainly need; open‘ minds-~i_rij d’.!:9.¢F§.5i!!8;
ideas -and facts.

“to investigate.

‘Br this."-hoviewen _

he says_that he does‘not mean that
people should. attack problems with-
out. giving them serious attention
ﬁnd thought. He is of the opinion
that our, modern education, along
these trends, tends to stiﬂe rather

bpen-minded discussion. His theory
pf; open-mindedness maintains that
we should not keep the mind open,
, t to be able to change it to some
more «constructive plan. _
*7 Dr. Elmer Graper, head of the po-
litical science department, is thor-
‘pughly in- accordance ' with the or-
anization of a liberal group at

itt. 'In_.discussing the matter he
‘said, "‘I'ain thoroughly in favor and
iieartily approve any organization

COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE.
LIFE DISCUSSED AT DINNER

 

 

Views on companionate marriage
and married life as held by Judge
Ben’ Lindsay and Mrs. Bertrand Rus-
sell were topics of discussion at a
dinner given by Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women, for her art of living
class at Heinz house Friday.

To get a clear view of Lindsey's
book, “Coinpanionate Marriage,” and
Mrs. Russell's book on “The Right
to Happiness,” a resume of the for-
mer was presented by Edwin Haze-
lett, Col. ’28, and the latter was re-
viewed by Catherine Fleming, Col.
'28. Following‘ the presentation of
the reports an open forum was held.
Most of the students agreed with
Judge Lindsey that companionate
marriage is ideal providing it is
understood. A more universal
knowledge of birth contro‘ is an im-
portant factor in successfully carry-
ing on a companionate marriage, the
class believes.

COLORBLINDNESS OF MEN MAKES
CO~ED CLOTHING MORE COLORFUL

7———-

Clothing of Pitt co-eds is more col-
orful than that of the men, de-
clares Dr. Alfred E. Wolf, in-
structor in zoology and color ex-
pert. That four men to one woman
are color blind probably accounts
for this laxity of taste on the part
of the men, Dr. Wolf maintains.

A man’s taste for color is ap-
parent in the kinds of ties he pur-
chases, says Dr. Wolf. “And some
of these atrocities are enough to
make me jump from my seat,” he
adds.

“There are no colors that do not
go together,” says Dr. Wolf, “pro-
viding the colors combined are pure.
There is nothing more beautiful
than ‘a green and red combination,
or a blue and green. Likewise col-
ors of equal purity will always

trimmings

Many Pitt co-eds have come to
Dr. Wolf for aid in choosing this
color combinations for a ﬂowered’
or some other type of dress trim-

di-.«_

ming. “In fact,” says Dr. Wolf, “I ’ I

have even gone shopping with some
of my women students, to aid them
in a choice of dress material.” No

men students have expressed a de-.-—. 7

sire to receive advice on this score, -_ 

he says.
Men are inclined to choose colors
by their mind and not their eyes,
and women have a greater tolerance.
for color than do men. Tolerance
in color is more essential than in
music, since this sense has never
been developed, asserted Dr. Wolf.
_ Dr. Wolf points out that in select-
ing color combinations, women un-
consciously follow another

Zuppke said he was one of the best

considerable oﬁiciating in the West.
being assigned to many big games. 1
He is anxious to get an ass _ nt

tained Professor Williams. “news-
papers have also made di lomacy
more democratic by the pa lishing
of ‘inside information.’ Not only
has the press sought to secure
more open methods in international
dealings, but with the gift of clair-
voyance, it frequently publishes
copies of documents not intended
for the light and gives forth trust-
worthy accounts of secret meet-
ings.” He believes that the senate
has also played an important role
in making for open diplomacy by
debates in open session.

“The participation of the public
in the framing of policies has de-
veloped as scientific improvements
have brought about a more rapid
and fuller transmission of informa-
tion,” Dr. Williams held. “It is
suggested that a most salutatory
and wholesome result would be
achieved if all diplomatic corres-
pondence, .the rinting of which is

. not incompatib e with the public in-

terest, should be published earl in
the succeeding year. I should like,
for example, to know what have

been our dealings with the govern- 11
- ments of Cuba or Santo Domingo

during the past year. And I can
hardly bring_ myself to believe that
the publication of this material
would really jeopardize the safety

jority Always Right?" at_a social
science conference at Trinity insti-
tute last week.

Dr. Boots pointed out  the ma-
jority principle is of relatively_ re-
cent origin and not based historical‘-
ly on any ethical considerations.
Rather it has “gradually become the
cus “ where party feeling is very
stron , to settle matters by count-
ing..heads instead of breaking them."

ized that the majority was not al-
ways right and therefore placed
most power in the hands of congress
and state legislatures. rather than
in the hands of the people.

The lecture was followed by a
conference discussion on Friday
afternoon, in which Dr. Boots
summed up his points and answered
questions raised b his audience. Dr.
Boots was the t ird sneaker in a
series of lectures on present day
problems sponsored by Dr. Percy G.
Kammerer, rector of Trinity church.
The, lectures are divided into six
main divisions, namely, politics, edu-
cation, art, literature, ethics and re-

8103- .
Pitt faculty members who will de-

Johnson, professor and head of the
department of oil and gas produc-
tion; Dr. Grover H. Alderman, dean
of the school of education; Frederick

Guy S. Greene, assistantprofessor
of English, and Dr. Mont R. Gab-
bert, head of ‘the department of
philosophy.

Meetings of the institute are held
in Trinity church. Discussion con-
ferences conducted by the speaker
of the day are held on Fridays at
4 o'clock in Trinity house.

EMERGENCE”
Writings by Negroes and
writings about Negroes no long-
er depend on their.‘ novelty to
gain attention. They are ac-
cepted as part of current litera-

ture, interesting because they

indicate cultural devclopmat of
the Negro people, and because
they show utilization of fruit-
ful literary material. Some of
this literature is. brought to-

gether in twg recent books:

Plays 6; Negro Life (Har-
pers, $5.00), edited by Alain

Locke and Montgomery Doug-

lal, and Carolina DusIo—-e good
title!-(Harpers, $2.50), edited.
by Countee Cullen. ‘

The editors of the first call»
it a “source book of native
American drama.” Assembled
are twenty plays on the Negro

‘theme, by whiteand Negro dra-
matists. Many of the plays, it‘

must be confessed, are thin and
sophomoric. They are offset by
such things as Paul Green's

I “White Dresses," and “In Abra-

ham’: Bosom”--which, when
expandedinto nine scenes, won
the 1927 Pulitzer Prize-—Eu-
gene O'Neill’: “The Emperor

Jones,'f. and “The Dreamy Kid;"'

Willis Richardson’: “The Flight,
of the Natives;" Ridgley Tor-
rence’s “The Rider of the
Dreams,” and Ernest Culbert-
son's “Rackey." All of these
are readable and enlightening.
Carolz'ng‘Dusk is an antholo-
gy‘ of verse by negro poets,
known and unknown to the
casual reader.
detail tells the color of the
writer; more often the poetry
bears out Countee Cullen's
statement that it does “not
present any aberration from
the poetic tendencies of the‘
times.” There are poems about
death, about trials and tribula-
tions, but there are also -poems
of faith. of ' sensual. enjoyment,
and" of lyric intensity that cer-
tainly enrich American verse
with color, vitality, and fresh-
ness. , A
, Paul Dunbar,“ James Weldon

Johnson, Claude McKay; Jean

Toomer, Langston Hughes, and
Countee Cullen, all fairly well
known,’ are well represented.
Others that seem to. deserve
wider reading include Helene
Jackson, Joseph Cotter, Frank
Horne, Sterling Browne and

Arna Bontemps. We have found ,
more satisfying verse in Carol-*

‘ing Dusk than in any other re-
gent anthol_ogy we can recall. ‘
II it I‘

VIENNESE SUBTLETY

Daybreak (Simon & Schus-
ter, $1.50), the newest of
Arthur S c h nit zl e r’s novel-
ettes, is 3- study of chance, writ-
ten with cool artistry that has
as much effect as the events it
depicts.‘

A, former” companion awoke

mLieutcnant Willa‘ Kasda one .
morning to ask aid in making“
good a thousand gulden deﬁ- ”
- cit in his accounts. The young.‘
lieutenant had no such sum,

but he promised to see what
he could do. Duringthe after.-
noon and ‘evening-he gambled-
with luck, that swayed from
gain to loss. Four. thousand
gulden ahead, at one time, he
ﬁnished eleven thousand gulden
in debt. He then tried to get
the money from an uncle, and
fate twirled’ him to a logical
ending. .

We are so silenced by
Schnitzler’s style, his freedom
from moral platitudes, and the
superb. structure of the piece,
that we refrain from comment
other than to say that a casual
reading may not yield all that
Daybreak offers.

Like Aunt Aggie on her an-
nual visit, Booth‘ Tarkington
is again in the windows» of book

dealers, this time‘ with Claire“

A m b l e r (Doubleday, Daren,
$2.50), the portrait of a young

‘ lady enchanted with her own

personality and thirsty for
men. ' D

To place itfhaphazardly, it

_ belongs with The Plutocrat,

Aliceg Adams, and Woiﬁen,
rather than with Pcnrod and
Seventeen, or with Monsieur
Beaucairc. It is a new combi-
nation, though ; perhaps a com-
bination of Seventeen and The
Plutocrat.

In the first part—-there are
three—Claire ﬂirts. heartless-

lege sophomore, ﬁnally wins
her angry respect by calling her

As the stbry ends Claire un-

had previously driven into an.
engagement’ 3 with a young‘ man-’

Our book-shelves show that M
we always had a .ﬂare for .
books about young men who‘

go to college, throw them-
selves against the gates of

life, fall in love, et cetera. Cy-v -.

ril Hume's The Wife of the
Centaur, Eliot‘ K. Paul's Im-
pnrturbe, and John T. Freder-
ick's Green Bush are among.
them.

To their ranks comes Max
Eastman’s Venture (A. & C.
Boni, $2.50), in which Jo Han-
cock, a young poet, gets kicked
out of college, reads for a year,
and then attacks Greenwich
Village. He writes poetry.
tries to distribute fresh cof-
fee, ‘turns socialist, knows
women, and has a part in every-
thing that is labeled today as
life.

The author, Max Eastman, is
known for The Enjoyment of
Poetry and Journalism 22:. Art.
Venture is not as good in the
licld of fiction as the first of

the other two books is in the .

ﬁeld of poetical appreciation.
Yet it is a book of ideas that
young people will enjoy.

The Youth and Patriotism .
It was my good fortune to

have been gnduatod from an ,‘
American high school not so
. long ago. The good fortune lids
in the idea of getting ‘out ofone

of the worst beds of reaction-'
that it is possible toﬁnd  -.
American institutions.‘ In this

A school, asin all American edu-
cational institutions, -petrloti£m,;,

although not. a subject that 
taught outright. is 5- 

” thst is‘ imbibed; by the evera‘ge..

student with the aid ofcerteins

nlembers of the faculty 
orator: who come tithe scbooh

every now and then toipeelk. _ .
It is ‘true; that "I_  ’
legience" is not‘ recited 
day, and that “The Star «Span-‘
gled Banner" is not sung 
day’-—-but do ‘not thinltéfor a mo-

. lnent that patriotism’ 
, forgotten, and that _
tjonary American institution-‘hat

realized’ the destructibility of"
this decadent sentiment. The
boards of education  that
the average high school student
is able to comprehend just a

' ‘triﬂe more than “I , pledge al-
legiance” without becoming too

analytical =- that if anything
were told him in a high and

“ mighty manner, he would swal-

low it without a grain of salt.
It is upon this state of mind‘tha..t
the. conscious" and .-unconscious
capitalist tools play with their
patriotism, anti-Sovietism, Yel-
low Peril, etc. ' _ '

In celebration of Memorial
Day, the whole student. body or
this school was asked to donate
a few pennies with which topaz‘-
chase a new silk American, ﬂag.‘
This purchase, of course,’ would
tend to instill that;beautiful7end-
uplifting sentiment of love as

. country. Some students“:did‘Vnot' _“
help this worthy cause. Wile.

liam Randolph‘ Hearst would
probably say they were in 
pay of the Soviet Union. 

the day forcelebrating arrived,‘ _

half the student body. was

where could be seen _thej_newly-“

* bought ﬂag. '

The program was opened

in which he stressed the‘ false’

'''‘‘blight’’ which was undermining.‘ ‘

the wonderful institutions.o_f our ‘
blessed country and that this
"blight" must be strangled in -its
infancy. He did not name the
“blight” probably because a
sixth sense told him that he
might ﬁnd so few of its sym-
pathizers in the audience. Of
course he made no contrast be-
tween destructive war and con-
structive peace. "

This program of which ‘I have
just spoken is only one of many.
The jingoes realize that there is

C an armament race which will

result in 8. terrible destructive
war, that the masses (especially
the youth) must be prepared for
it by,prbpaganda,‘and»tha.t'th.¢.
place where this propaganda will
have the most effect is in the
schools nourished by American‘
capitalism. It is up to us as

You say Punch is dead? Yes. . . .I know.. I wasstanding at‘

-“I'm Polly Prim, sir!" \

“And what drives Miss Polly Prim out on a wet‘ nigbtlilﬁt this '2”

“Punch, sir. . . .you. know Punch. . . .wsll, sir, Punch is. . . V.

. I indulged in a few more pleasantries before putting on a coat
and going to‘ the door with’ Miss Polly on one arm. Tethered at the

NEW YORK SYMPHONY
The ﬁfth pair of orchestra con-
certs in the Pittsburgh Orchestra
Association series will be pre-

Esented by Walter Damrosch and
‘his New York ‘Symphony Orchestra

ion Friday and Saturday, January
*2’: and 23. This orchestra is al-
ways welcome in Pittsburgh and
brings old and new works on its
program. Those who expect to
find tho“‘prima donna” type of
conductor will be disappointed, be-
cause Damrosch is almost every-
thing but this. He is a ﬁnished
musician, a sympathetic inter-
preter of. modern music, and one
who, has been associated with mas-
tcrworks for his entire. life.

The piece do resistance for Fri-
day svening is the Beethoven Eroica
symphony, the ﬁrst of the “great”
ones. Beethoven originally dedicated
this work to. Napoleon, but later
removed‘ the dedication because of
his disgust with the mature antics
of the Emperor. This early work
ranks with the great Choral sym-
phony’ which was his “swan song.”
The symphony for Saturday’s con-
cert is the Brahm’s Second. It is
interesting to-note in passing that
Brahms’ works were the cause of
the break-up of the old Pittsburgh
Orchestra. _Emil Paur, the last con-
doctor of this organisation, in-
sisted that the public should like
Brahms. who was then “new.” The

public objected and as a result the
orchestra. was not supported. This

year when a symphony of Brahms
was played we noticed that it was
the most applauded work on the
'prog_ram. Some of the other works
to be played are: La. Nuit. En-
soreelee, Chopin-Aubert; the Bac-
chanals from Tannhauser; Debus-
sy’s— L’apree-midi, cl'un Fa.une,=‘ Cha-
brier’t" Spanish‘ Rhapsody; the pre-
lude to Lohengrin; Strauss’ Roses
from the South; and I-Ionegger’s
Paciﬁc 231. This last work’ is one
which has aroused comment both
in this country and in Europe. It
portrays the spirit and power he-
hind, the; modern locomotive. Those:
who have-. sympathies with the
mechanistic’ age will find this “tour
j. do l'force”‘ interesting; those who
tare‘ incurable. romantics will‘ think
it ugly. We. like it.‘ I

with manyvﬂne themeafor ~ , and
The rich string section of
the orchestra was displayed to ad-
vantage in this number.

The second number was a new
one to Pittsburgh. It was an early
work of Strawinsky entitled Sheree
Fantastique and seemed to have
beeniinspired by bees. After the
first few bars we forgot all about
the bees and listened with interest
to the play of orchestra color. But
it was too long. The composer
could have said all he did say in
half as much. It was pleasant and
technically interesting, but it was
not the sparkling Strawinsky of Pe-
trouchka, or the ironist of The Song
of the Nightingale, or even the joke-
ster of Little Suites. This Scherzo
was merely the result of a young
Russian’: experimenting with the
orchestra. '

Ravel’s choreographic poem, La
Valse, was the second new number
on the program. It is a fantasy us-
ing Straussian and Viennese waltz
motives, and was composed after the
war. On the surface it was bril-
liant and vivacious, but underneath
there‘ was a foreboding current of
irony on the post war‘ world. It
was mad--yes-—but magniﬁcently
madl, The only things we can
think of are .4 Victory Ball and
Richard Strauss’ Also Sprach Zara-
thustra. Surely Ernest‘ Schelling
must have had this work ringing in
his ears when he wrote’ his depic-
tion of the jazz-mad world.

The Symphony‘ in D Minor of
Cesar Franck formed the second
half of the program. Franck must
have been a marvelous man to
write such a work. Every time
we hear it the feeling. that it is
one of the ‘truly, great works in-

P)’.

its haunting brass theme, the sec-

ond with its charming‘ cantabile,

and the third with its spirited syn-
copation is the product ‘of a man
who had a philosophy‘ of life, one
who was master of himself and at
peace with nature. No more ' ped-
dlcr of tunes could write» such a
“scab-stirring” (we admit that the
words are hackneyed, but speech-
lessnoss overtakes‘ us in this in-
stance) mountain moving work.
When we left the auditorium on
Friday night we regretted that we
could. not hear, the whole concert-
repeated.

Saturday's conccrt“_was,a1:nos.t as

pleasing‘ as the previous evenings.-’

The program opened with Smctana’s
Bartered Bride overture‘. This light,
capricious music is the very embodi-
ment of jollity. Thematically de-
rived from the opera, this) overture.

IME and again I have
heard that “There is

beauty in poverty and in
wretchedness.” But what an il-
lusion of bourgeois artists and
so-called intellectuals this beau-
ty must be.

Not until a few years ago
did I realize that Pittsburgh had
slums. Four years ago, 1 did
not give a thought to the pos-
sibility of the existence of slum
districts; three years ago, I be-
gan to ndtice them in my news-
paper route; only two years ago,
I became fully convinced that
Pittsburgh had its full share
of such districts. In fact, too

full a share.
B Most of my spare time

I have passed in dis-
tricts where houses were built
closely together, and where peo-
ple were packed closely together
in these houses.

I have entered these homes
(if one may call these pig-styes
homes without any ciualms of
conscience), and have spoken
with the people concerning their
conditions. I have asked in-
numerable questions about their
emotions, their ideas of living
conditions, their desires for a
change in life, et cetera; and
I have received different and
thought-provoking answers.

times. By the time the ‘Minuetto
was ﬁnished we were heartily long-
ing to go out and smoke. .

D’Indy’s Istar Variations and De-
bussy’: Iberia comprised the second
half of the program. The iirst of
these was a “theme and variations”
in the modern manner." The theme
with all its unutations opened the
work and unwrapped as‘ it pro-
gressed. The simpliﬁed theme did
not appear until the very end of the
selection. D’Indy is the one remain-
ing Frenchman who hasn't fallen
for atonalism or polytonalism or one

of the other “isms," and it is quite I

{Captain Reed Expects A
Team to Go Unbeaten
By NICHOLAS G. TROILU

“I am afraid that we will go
through the season undefeated,”
spoke Sykes Reed, demon leader of
the Golden Panther basketball team,
when cornered and asked about the
team in general.

And this. basketballer knows of
what he speaks. For about eight
years or so, Reed has played
basketball and has also had a spicy
taste of football, baseball and other
sports.

He began his famous career way
back in the grade schools, of Brad-
dock, later going to Braddock High
school where he starred in football,
baseball and basketball. Braddock
always has been known for its_ﬁne
basketball teams and to say the
least, Sykes contributed more than
his share to make the floor sport a
more popular one in the Steel town.

Attended Braddock High

While playing. forward ‘on the
Braddock team, Reed won the high
scoring honors in the W. P. I. A. L
His line passing, dribbling and
shooting ability earned for him a
great rep and with this he cast eyes
toward a college education. Sykes
received all sorts of offers to enter
numerous schools and play basket-
ball but disregarded them to enter
Penn State.

At State Reed. went out for bas-
ketball, football and baseball; mak-
ing all three teams. At the end of
the year Sykes had‘ e .rned numerals
in baseball and basketball. Reed
starred on the basketball team,
proving a. sensation with‘his'shoot-
mg, passing and all around, playing
ability. It was at State that Reed
gave sincere promise of developing
into the good player that he is to-

day.
Comes To Pitt- '

After one year at State, Reed dis-
covered that it would suit his pur-
pose better if he studied and pre-
pared himself for a career in the
held of dentistry: He, immediately
sent away to all the different col-
leges that taught the teeth plumb-
ing business and after looking over
the entire ﬁeld chose Pitt.

Reed was advised not to play foot-
ball as he might open himself to in-
juries that would ruin his chances‘
on the ﬂoor. After being on the

"fresh ﬂoor team a. week- this. Brad-

dock. lad discovered that his best
chance in making the team lay in
giving up all thoughts of playing at
forward and switching to a guard.
McMasterS, needed ,3.‘ guard and wel-
comed Reed. Long and hard did
this Braddock. star work. Almost
every night one could ﬁnd Reed
playing a solo up at the old basket-
ball ﬁoor inthe stadium, trying his
hand in the new; position. .
Stars At Guard

One year of constant playing at
guard found Reed‘ emerging,-' as a
ﬁnished player read to join the
ranks of Carlson. or the past

three” years Sykes has played in this"
.position and; has done it so well for

the past two years that he was the
unanimous choice as All-non Con-

ference guard, and guard on’ the

mythical All-star ﬁve. These, in-
deed, were well earned». honors. The
All-star ﬁve included Tech, Du-
quesne, State, West Virginia and
Wash-J_efl’..

Last year Reed tied Kowallls for
individual scoring honors.

Sykes has been a consistent play-
er ever since he started to handle
a basketball. Often, even when he
is within striking distance of the
basket, he will pass the ball to one
of his fellow players to ring up.
Reed has the greatest respect for
his fellow players. He likens the
basketball team, to one big family-,

with none of the discards and inter-'

nal strifes that so often prevailant
within a family noticeable. “Sikes”
believes that Hyatt and Wrobleski
are two of the greatest basketball
players ever to grace a Panther
ﬂoor, and Zehfuss, Cohen, McMahon
and Wunderlich are valuable Amen.
That seems to be the true reason
why the Golden Panthers are win-
ning so many games and is justwhy
the lanky captain is afraid that the
team will go through the season un-
defeated.

“The schedule was nicely arranged

Sutherland. .

Again referring to. the‘ Stanford

ame, “I wanted to go-out there, and
Iwanted the team to go out there.
I heartily enjoyed it. We played

The Stanford team that beat Pitt,
was the best ‘team that ever‘ played

Outlook Not Bright

Turnin to the outlook for -‘next
year, Joc admitted, “We will lose
sixteen men, including eight varsity
players, by graduation this spring.
The schedule arrangement is the
most diﬁicult I have ever been called
on to face, and‘ there is a lot to be
accomplished. We may come u to
expectations of some alumni, an we
may not. I know very little about

Player’s Account’ Of
Jaunt to California
By RICHARD GOLDBERG

This exclusive account of the
Golden Punthe-rs’ trip to the
coast for the Stanfcrrd game
has been writtewz for the Pitt
Weekly '-by Dick Goldberg, Pan-
ther center.

As you all know, we pulled out
of Pittsburgh aboard our special
pullmans the Monday night after
Christmas. Our ﬁrst stop was St.
Louis where we left the; train for
half an hour and had our pictures
taken by St. Louis newspaper men.
The boys sent cards home and we
just fooled around the station until
it was time to depart.

The next stop was Kansas City
where we arrived the following
night. We again had ‘our pictures
taken and after parading around
the town, taking in the sights and
buying souvenirs, we left for
Dodge City via the Sante Fe, rail.-
road. Getting there around noon

the following day, we were greeted“
by the high school boys of the town;
who were very kind to us and per-

mitted us the use of their foot-
ball ﬁeld. This was our ,ﬁr’st prac-
tice. session en route and the‘ boy?
t
was warm, but the boys felt ﬁne.

-the ride seemingly having no bad_

effects. .
First Practice Held

W- practiced that afternoon be-
fore a crowd of 3,000 townspeople.
The drill was nice and snappy and
after practice we visited Boot Hill,
a historic. ‘place where the cowboys
of old were buried with their boots
on.
Joe Hodge, notorious horse thief,
whose leiters were cut to prevent
him from mounting stolen horses.
Hodge was-‘ nearly 90 years old, and
ﬁlled. the boys with wild cowboy
and Indian tales.

We pulledout of Kansas City

that ‘nightand the next stop: was
Aubuquerque, N. M. We practiced
before a crowd of 3,000 people and
both towns were impressed with
Gibby and hiscohorts. The entire
team was the guest’ of the wonder-
ful Indian theatre, the Kimona. We
also visited Islets, Indian Reserva-

tion, where. we fooled, around and.

met the Indians and everything
else. Most of the fellows" ﬁlled
their. pockets with trinkets at ‘the
‘reservation.
‘ See War Dance

, Ash Forks, Arizona, was our next
stopover, but rain interfered and
we,were,fo_rced to stop over at
Winslow. instead,» where 500 people
watched us hold our third prac-
tice drill., After practice the In-
dians put on a war dance, which
was the real -thing, the Indians
wearing the genuinewar aint and
everything else. Every ody en-
men. 2

Following the dance the “party
boarded the train and head 1 for
Pasadena.» On the way we stop-
ped off and ate at one of the _,fa-
mous Fred Harvey restaurants
which are found all along the line.
The receptions we had received at

every stop had been very hospita-

ble.

. , Entering California

When we reached the state of
California,‘ we were greeted with
beautiful orange groves, extending
for miles, magniﬁcent sunsets, and
rugged mountains. Light work-
outs were staged Saturday and‘
Sunday. In the evenings we went
to the, movies.

Monday was the day of the game
which is now past history. .

A Hot Party
After the game, the boys split
up into numerous groups. A group
of four of us, including Mike Getto,
Charlie Edwards, Joe Donchess and
myself, formed a party and went to
Cocoanut. Grove, a fashionable re-
sort, where we broke into a party
of movie stars. Here_ we met
Phylis Haver, Marie Prevost, Emer-
son Crane, director, Bobbie Agnew,
D. W. Griﬂith and danced with the
actresses. We sure had a darn
good time at this party. They
wanted.t0 hold another. party for
us the next day, but we were too
busy. . V '
The entire bunch went through
all the movie studios with the ex-
ception of the Warner and the
Paramount lots. That night we
were guests of the Chinese theatre
and later went to Bull Pen Inn.
See Catalina Isle
After returning to Pasadena, we
left for Catalina Island in two
lass bottom boats which was won-
erful. We could look through the
glass bottom of the boat and see
huge ﬁshes and deep ocean bottom
plant growth that was something
Henry K. Thaw was
aboard the boat with his party and
we tried to dance on deck, but the
ocean was too rough, and the boat
rocked from side to side.
_ Following a banquet at San Fran-
CISCO, which both teams attended.

‘and a trip through the Stanford

campus, we departed for home
on the Southern Paciﬁc and Union
Paciﬁc railroads. The trip home
included stops at Salt Lake city
where we gave the Mormon colony
the once over, Denver, where we
climbed Lookout Mountain, Chi-
cago, and then the ride to Pitts-
burgh.

While traveling the boys amused
themselves by playing bridge, sing-
ing and Just fooling around.

The receptions we received from
Pitt alumni all along the way made
us feel good and we all greatly ap-
preciated the interest the alumni
showed in making the long jour-
ney as pleasant as possible.

lie ‘ate Tragedies No. IV. But
we li ed Chick's other stuff, espe-
cially the one with the crack about
the Rubicon. “Walt” Conrath dem-
onstrated that he deserves the es-
teamed position as editor of the Pan-
ther by some original pseudo-frescoe
work entitled Evolution. Good stuff
we must admit! Panther can feel
conceited about this work.

To get back to the editorial page,
we ﬁnd that Panther’s trainers have
at last put on a more sophisticated
air, and as a result have given us
some things to think about. The
first editorial is rather obvious and
suggests a throwback on Books And
Things. (Perhaps the literary page
represented the guilty party. We
never’ thought of that.) Such
th.iags..do not happen in the best of
ma azines.

hose other articles are first class
stuff even though we could not get
why “The Crusader’s Handbook” ap-
peared in. this section. We laugh
anyhow.

Books and Things is up to stan-
dard and we enjoyed discovering a
mortalwho still can feel like going
sleigh riding tolthe tune of ”The
Gypsies’ Warning.”

e, also liked “The Hall of
Shame.” Panther, as we said be-»
fore, is making a success of being
different. Of course, we know that
everyone else knows who the illus-
trious Pillsbury is.‘ Still we could
offer some good suggestions to this
innovation.

Editorial sagacity displayed good
judgment in inserting those choice
bits from newspaper files of years
gone by. We liked them.

ll4V£:[l the poetry in this issue is
good. Some of the stuff is too good

or Panther. But we don’t mind it
there. And we promise to read Pan-
that if the editor keeps up the all-
around good work that he has dem-
onstrated ln this issue.‘

(Now let us make one more sug-
gestion. How about thinking up
something new for a cut on the edi-
torial page. The old one hurts our
eyes. . .)_

«Perhaps if we think a tiny bit we
will retract some of the dirty cracks
that we spit out, but you know we
must be fastidious or Panther will
take it for granted that his is a
good publication.Nevertheless if we
"see more of the same brand of work

Extend Pre-Registration
System To All Students

 

Enlarged to include» freshman
and sophomores, the new. system of
pre-registration which went into ef-
fect last September for Juniors
and seniors, will be effective for
February mid-year registration, ac-
cording‘ to J. G. Quick, registrar.

All students who are continuing
in the same sections in which they
are now registered, may pre-regis-
ter by entering the second semes-
ter courses opposite the corres-
ponding first semester course and
submitting study lists at the oiﬁce
of the registrar not later than noon.
February 4. Class coupons will be
reserved for these students. Who
will receive a special permit admit-
ting them to Syria Mosque when
ﬁnal registration will be held. At
the Mosque, pre-registering stu-
dents will secure their registration
booklets and pay their tuition.
Usual conferences with advisers
will not be necessary. _

Pre-registration will not be per-
mitted for students ‘whose study list
is stamped “probation” or “provi-
sional,” or if‘ the proposed second
semester program, contains any
course that is not an exact continu-
ation or a” required sequence of a
first semester course. ,

Study lists and second semester
schedules for all classiﬁed students
registered in the college, schools _of =
engineering, mines, business adnii.n-
istration, and education will be dis-
tributed at the ofﬁce of the regis-
trar in accord with the ‘following

school of business administration.
January 31; school of engineering
and mines, Tuesday, January 31;
school of education, Wednesday,
February 1. Students failing to
call for study lists according to
the above schedule will not be per-
mitted to secure this form until
February 6, atwhich time‘ more do-
sirable registration periods will
have been assigned..-

Study listsiof eac school will be
distributed in numerical order, so

dents from all schools may register
each hour. Study lists bearing low ,
numbers will entitle holders. to},
early» admission to ‘Syria Mosque‘
during the ﬁnal registration period.‘
A For the ‘convenience ofthe stu-
dents the registrar’s_ oﬂlce“ will be
open at 8 o’clock from Monday, J an-
uary 30, to Friday, February 8, in-
clusive. Early application is nec-
essary for students desiring to pro-
cure study lists bearing a preferred
number of each period. M

carding the fez, Kemal Pasha said

* that “it was the cause of all super-

stition and delay in progress.”
Machinery is slow in entering
Turkey because the country has little
money with which to buy it. How-
ever, four agricultural stations‘ have
been. built to experiment with ma-
chinery. For the most part, though,

iron stuck on one end” prevails on
the Turkish farm.

The ﬁnances of Turkey are be-
coming more settled. Turkey is
willing ‘to pay her war debts, re-
marked the speaker. Sale of mono-
polies on oil, alcohol, salt, and
matches is occupying Turkey just
now.

The youth of Turkey is active,
about 100 lodges of men and women
having been organized to further‘
nationalism, Turkish literature art,
Although the
young people can e expected to be
reokless~ and extremely opposed to
tradition, they -are much more set-
tled than the American youths.

Divorce in Turkey is very simple,

man has to do is to say to his wife,
‘I'll divorce thee.’ Polyrramy is not
common among the Turks, for their
religion and economic life has made
itimpossible. for men to support
harems. This silly idea of a bun-
dred thousand Turkish harems“ is
100 per cent American,” stated
Barnes. Almost all women in Tur-
key have adopted the, modern mode
of dress; only in the interior are
women to be found who cover their
faces. Enrollment at Roberts Col-

women is high, and\Turkish students
are always visiting and studying in

.American and European institutions‘,

he remarked. In summary, Mr.
Barnes. gave a clear and brief re-
view of the history of Turkey from
theeleventh century to the present
time. Tracing the invasions of the
Turks, their wholesale adoption of
the Persian language, and the seiz-
ure of Constantino lelilie continued
to _a discussion of urkey’s place in’
the late war and her diplomatic re-
lations. _ .
