MANY P L A N S GIVEN

Several’ speeches by various mem-

bers of the faculty, describing student

buildings in a number of our larger
institutions throughout the United
States featured the ‘regular weekly
convocation’ of last Week. Chancellor
McCormick being absent, Prof; Gibbs
had charge of the opening exercises.
Dr. Ullman spoke on the merits of
the Reynolds Club, which is the great
student organization of the University
of Chicago. This social building of
this club is three stories, on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor are reading rooms and billiard
and pool rooms; on the second ﬂoor
is a large dance hall, there are also
committee rooms on this ﬂoor; on the
third ﬂoor is a small theatre well fur-
nished in which are given plays and
various entertainments ,during the
year. Any male member of the Uni-

company upon their personality and
accuracy in the drill. The members of
this company have been working hard
since their organization last‘ spring
and the praise given by the inspector
was received with great enthusiasm.

In target practice the company ‘has
improved its mark of last year by over
22 points. At the last inspection the
company jumped from ninth place in
the regiment to ﬁfth. The members
all say that by another inspection.th_ey

faithful work will count. _

At present the position of ﬁrst lieu-
tenant is vacant and an election will
be held in the near future to ﬁll this
position. The friends of “Tex” Rich-

At a meeting of the foreign students
of the University, called together by
Mr. Paul =Chowey, a University Cos-

mopolitan Club was organized. This »

is a much needed ‘club and should
prove a great success. Its motto is’

1. To produce a friendly intercourse
between students from all lands irre-
spective of race, caste or creed.

land they represent and an interest in
the people of their country. (This.

' THE PITT WEEKLY

CLASS VISITS DISPATCH

 

Journalistic Students Study Practical’

Newspaper Plant.

 

T-he Pitts-burgh Dispatch enter-
tained the class in journalism of the
University of Pittsburgh with a trip
through their plant on Saturday even-
ing last. For an hour and a half the
students were givena practical dem-_
onstration of how a large city news-
paper is run, not a detail of work be-

P ing overlooked in the visit to the Dis-
‘ patch.» P ‘

' At the start the students were taken
up to t'he editorial rooms, where news
of all sorts comes in, (by wire and re-
porters, and is written up and given
its proper value as news, then sent in

7 tubes to the composing room, thus do-

ing away with any loss of time.

' From the editorial rooms the class
went to the sanctum sanctorium of 21
newspaper -— the editor-in-chief"s of-
ﬁce. The Dispatch has, perhaps, the

' most ‘beautiful office for its editor-in-

chief in Pittsburgh, being without
fault in every respect. It is only a
few steps from this ofﬁce to the
“morgue,” or reference room, with a
“cut” room next to it, where almost

C any sortof reference can be had, also

all cuts of prominent persons.

‘After leaving the “morgue” the “fu-
ture newspaper editors” were taken to
the composing room, where
watched the long line of linotype men
at work; saw type put into “forms,”
and each one got his name printed on

‘a metal plate by a lin'oty»pe,man to

take home as a remembrance of his

' trip to the Dispatch.

Next the press room was visited,
where the last stage of the work is
"done and where the paper is ﬁnally
Here are used up every
night 46,800 pounds of paper.

The last place visited was the mail-
ing room where the papers are as-
sorted for the various routes, the

"V -paper being put up section «by section

and ﬁnally sent out for distribution.

Everyone was amazed at the mar-
velous unity of action displayed in the
Every man is dependent on
each other for the success of the work
done —- a mistake taking place any-
pwhere along the line putting the
whole system at a disadvantage. By
the simple fact that, -when urgent
news may go from- editor to street
_di_stril)ution in eight minutes, one can

. see it is necessary to\have almost per-

fect co-operation in a newspaper
plant. ‘

When all had been seen the class
expressed their ap.preciati'on of the
courtesy and kindness of the Dispatch
in showing to them the workings of
a great newspaper plant. '

versity of Chicago may join this club.
The dues are six dollars a year. Ac-
cording to Dr. Ullman, you get much
more than six dollars a year in value
from the club, and the club is a great
asset to the University of Chicago.

Dr. Scholes gave his views and im-
pressions of the student buildings at
Yale. There are two great schools at
Yale, viz., the regular “Academic”
school, and the “Shefﬁeld Scientiﬁc"
school. i .

The building of the “Academic”
school is called “White” hall.’ This is
t'he Y. M. C. A. «building. It has read-
ing rooms, a lunch room, billiard room
and alarge hall where Sunday even--
ing services are conducted. Sheiheld
building is known as “Byers” hall. It
is more of a social building. It is
very beautiful within and without.

Professor Mellor spoke on “Hous-
ton” hall at the University of Penn—
sylvania. The ﬁrst ﬂoor has reading
rooms, billiard room and p0st—ofﬁc‘e;
on the second floor are “Trophy,” Y.
M. C. A., lunch and committee rooms;
on the third floor are society and of-
ﬁce rooms. Everyone is a member of
this club and live thousand pass in
and out of Houston hall every day.

Professor Crafer had little to say on
Harvard or Wisconsin’s system. He
said that he had attended both insti-
tutions for a speciﬁc purpose and in
carrying out this purpose he had lit-
tle time to follow up the social activi-
ties in either school. He pointed out
the _co-operative dining hall plan at
Harvard as being well worked out and
worthy of consideration here at “Pitt.”

Dr. Sies gave his views on the sit-
uation at Columbia. There the build-
ing was a gift and the students had
no part in raising the money. It fol-
lows closely the general run of stu-
dent bwildings, having reception rooms.
billiard rooms and trophy rooms, be-
sides a large assembly room. The
building is under the control of the
Secretary of the Y.‘ M. C. A.

Professor Chambers said: “Bray-
nard hall at Lafayette is the centre of
school life. It follows the general
plan of social buildings and was erect-
ed" at a=cost of sixty thousand dollars.

G. M. Kirk, speaking for the stu-_

dent body,._urged the students to take
up the work of getting the money for
the students’ building of Pitt with
spirit and energy. He warned the stu-
dents aga-i_n‘st liecoming pessimistic as
to the outcome, although ‘he drifted
once or twice himself into a more or
less pessimistic point of view on one
or two subjects before he ﬁnished his
speech.

Ofﬁcers Were Elected.

At meetings held at a recent date
officers were elected for the ensuing
year for the two classes—]unior and
Freshmen —- Dental department, as
follows: Junior class, W. G. Phillips

WORK ON SHOPS TO START

 

(Continued from Page 1)

The engineering shop work is differ-.

ent from that of other schools. It is
not intended to train a mechanic. It
is planned by co-operative work in
the laboratory to make him familiar

with processes and study materials be-

fore heienters the co-operative work-
ing system. ~

The equipment is original in many
ways. In the foundry are three cupo-
las; two small and one large one. The
latest type of molding machine with
other paraphernalia is there, "so that
iron, «brass, aluminum, etc., can be
used and their properties studied.

The forage shop is unique and up to
date. It will be called the mechanical
laboratory. It will have special facil-
ities for heat. treatment of metals.
Among these are gas, oil and coke
ﬁre furnaces, and a dark room for
heat treatment of metals. Complete
types of pyrometer will be among the
equipment—with these a complete
study of_temperatures on metals may
be made. .

The machine shop will continue the
study of materials begun in the forge

“ shop. This will take the student into

the deeper and broader ﬁeld of engi-
neering, so preparing him for greater
efficiency in the‘ co-operative work
later to be pursued.

This building will be the bes:
«equipped with regard to the beneﬁt of
the student of any other on the cam-

pus. In” addition to shop and class
i rooms there will be locker rooms,
shower rooms, instructors rooms,

store rooms, pattern rooms, etc., all

1 ﬁtted in order to be the greatest value

to the student in his training.‘ The
department of engineering will be
thereby one of the most thoroughly
established in the University.

Not only will it be one of the best
equipped in the school, but also one
of the most systematic in training. for
the best results: Accommodations
will be sufficient that any'number of
students may be given instruction in

the fullest measure. It is_ Dean
Bis\hop’s plan to have no more than 20
in any section of a class, thereby, op-
erating straight through with classes
of 20. Under this revision of method
greatest results are expected from the
department.

In connection with this it might
also be mentioned that the forge
room which will be vacated on the
completion of the new building will
be converted into‘ a cement testing
laboratory. This cement testing will
be carried\ on in a much more exten-
sive scale than heretofore.

DENTAL NEWS.” .

~ Dentals ‘Have Mass Meeting.

Spirit which has been lacking in the
University in general cannot be ap-
plied to the Dentals. A mass meeting
was held Saturday noon, at which the
entire department was present. Cheer
Leader Philippbar put them through
their vocal exercises" in‘ preparation
for the day’s game. Such meetings
will be held at. frequent intervals.
This spirit should be carried out in
all -departments so as to make an ex~
cellenat showing for the next two
games especially. The Dentals can
hereafter be relied upon to do their
part in the roo-ting section.

. Pharmacy Class Holds Dance.

Last Friday evening was the occa-
sion of a well attended and enjoyable
dance given at Braun’s by the mem-
bers of the Department of Pharmacy
which was the ﬁrst of a series to be
held this winter.

The dance was arranged for by the
following committee: Miss Weber,
Messrs. Spahn, Duncan and Kossler.

The affair proved so delightful that
it is intended to have one each month
until spring, as was done last year.

Nirella’s orchestra furnished the
music. -

“Want to hear something great?”
“Sure.” "
“Rub two bricks together.”——Ex.

The ranks having been broken by recent gradu-

various classes of the University of Pittsburgh, into
the University Co. ‘,‘A-,” 18th Inf., in order that the

CAP AND GOWN
.HAS GOOD START

 

Prospects Are Bright for the Coming
Year of University
Dramatic Club

The Cap and Gown Club held its
first meeting of the present season
last Friday evening in Thaw Hall.
Almost all of the old members and a
large number of new men .turned out.
The prospects this year are brighten.-
than ever before. A good musical
comedy has been written for the club
and it is planned to make its produc-
tionione of the important features'of
the one hundred and twenty-ﬁfth an-
niversary celebration. The retiring
president, G. M. Kirk, ’l3, made a
short speech setting f'orth the favor-
able conditions existing for a success-
ful season and the necessity for elect-
ing good, energetic men as officers.
The men selected have been very’ ac-
tive in the club’s plays in the past
and expect to make the ,club better
than ever before. President—elect Z.
C. Wagoner, ’l3, addressed the men
and encouraged each one to stick and
Dr. J. S.
Ashbrook, who was re—elected as
treasurer, said that several good trips
would probably be taken. This the
club officers desire very much, saying
that it would not only -be a stimulus
for new members but would also be
one of the best means for advertising
the University. F. D. Tyler will again
be in charge of the dancing. The of-
ﬁcers elected are as follows: Z. C.
Wagoner, President; A. S. Haines,
Vice President; R. R. Johnston, Sec-
retary; Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, Treasurer;
H. N. Riley, Manager; E. S. Wasson.
Assistant Manager; F. D. Tyler, danc-
ing master; R. D. Linn, Property Man.

The ﬁrst answer to

To that Pittsburgh town to-day.

And see old Wash.-Jeff. play.

We will st'op each buck and run,

Then we’ll show ’em just for fun

How football is played and how all

We’re' here, boys, to win this game

BAND ASSESSMENT. '

We wish to call attention to the
small assessment levied.by the differ-
ent classes upon their members to help

(‘defray the expenses of the band. Per-
, haps nothing in ‘the school is more
. deserving of support than the Pitt Stu-

dent Band. With no reward whatever
but the thanks and praise of the stu-
dents, its members practice several

'_,times a week and lead all the singing

at 'our mass meetings and parades.
They have d'one ﬁne work «since their
organization. Certainly they deserve
the utmost support of faculty, stu-
dents and alumni.

At the present time the band is In
great need of funds with which to de-
fray its necessary expenses. Until -t

.receives the money to secure music.

and other supplies, it will be .-seriously
handicapped in its work. The instru-

~ments used were given by the Ath-

letic Committee. For their wisdom in
granting this money, the members of
the committee deserve great commen-
dation. No money this year has been
better spent than that used to start
the band. But there still is needed a
large sum.

This money the student senate and
the classes have determined to raise
by a small assessment upon every stu-
dent. This is a method by w'hich those
receivingithe beneﬁt of the band will
help support it. The assessment im-
poses severe ﬁnancial burden upon no
one. We are sure no student will ob-
ject to paying it. But we fear that its
speedy collection will be retarded
through carelessness or forgetfulness.
Until the funds needed are raised, the
band cannot do its best work. We
urge every man to pay his assessment
immediately. .

AN ORGANIZATION CALENDAR.

Thecrying need of the societies of
this school at the present timeis an
hour set apart for each club meeting.
Unfortunately .as now arranged sev-
eral clubs meet' at the. same time and
men belonging t‘o two clubs meeting at
one time are forced to drop their
mem-bership in one or the other.
When attempts are made to remove
the conﬁicts the schedule of classes
interfere with such changes. These
conflicts of club meetings are seriously
interfering with the work of the stu-
dent societies.

We recognize the difficulty of any

changes in the large schedule of a uni- _

versity, but it seems to us that great

‘effort should -be made to secure more

available time for student meetings.
Every organization should have a cer-
tain meeting time and place." Nothing
can beaccomplished with the present
system under which a society is called
to meet in a certain room at a certain
place and upon trying ‘to hold the
meeting ﬁnds that the room has been
occupied by some other group of stu-
dents or faculty or that another meet-
ing is in progress at which a large
number of their members are present.
We trust that some action which will
relieve this condition will be taken in
making out the next term schedule.

PRIZE ESSAYS.

Attention has been called in the col-
umns of The Pitt Weekly to the prizes
offeredfor the best essay upon “In-
ternational Peace.” All college and
university students in this country are
eligible to take part -in the contest.
There should be many competitors
from the University of Pittsburgh.
The students of this sch'ool have ac-
cess to one of the best equipped li-

MUSICAL -CLUBS.

In this issue appears an announce-
ment of the opening entertainment of
the Glee and Mandolin Club. This
will be held the night before Thanks-
giving. The Penn State Glee Club
will combine with the Pitt Musical
Clubs in this entertainment. This is
the first large social event of the col-
lege year and every man should deter-
mine to make it'a great success. The
clubs have been practicing for a long
time.and. they will be certain to do
their share toward this end. But with
out the students the members of the
clubs can do but little.- Upon thegsup-
port of the students’ and alumni they
must of necessity depend. Every man
should endeavor to do his share to-
ward supporting the loyal boys who

cal lines. Let every man talk about
the entertainment, go to it, and above
all get his tickets early. Then show
the Pitt spirit when you go.

Everyone out for the rotters’ meet-
ings.

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir :——I am writing to ask you
for permission to call attention to the
beautiful gymnasium on the hill. I
have been fortunate to see many beau-
tiful buildings, but I do‘ not believe I
have "ever seen one more beautiful. I
believe that it will be the prettiest
upon the campus. I would urge every
man to take the time to climb the hill
and see what we have. There is a
large space belonging to Pitt up there
and it will make a grand place. The
road makes it an, easy matter to reach
the top_of our hill. It will make a
beautiful ‘place, ﬁt for the University
of Pittsburgh. Yours sincerely,

 

 

Editor Pitt Weekly":

Dear Sir :——Pitt’s 125th anniversary
celebration is to show the people of
Pittsburgh what-Pitt really is. We
want to show the people that Pitt is
the place for the young man, but we
first want to show the young man that
Pitt~‘is the place for him. We want
High School boys around Pittsburgh
to know that they can get more at
Pitt than elsewhere. The thing to do
is -to make High Sch'ool pupils see
Pitt, talk Pitt, think Pitt and dream
Pitt. I would suggest that ad “Pitt
Weekly” be sent to each of the High
Schools in the neighborhood of Pitts-
burgh. Let High School students get
intouch with Pitt. Let them see it as
we see it. Start a High School col-
umn, publish things of interest to the
High School. Getthe High School
boys to “know” Pitt and our enroll-
ment-will increase as never before.

ANNOUNCEMENTSS

Electrometallurgy.

Students interested in-electrometal-
lurgy and those industries closely
connected with it are to see Prof.
Goodall at once. A class is being
organized by the aid of Drs. Benner
and Bacon. _

This course requires a . general
knowledge of chemistry and elemen-
tary electricity and will include lec-
tures and laboratory work.

The subject of metallurgy takes up
some of the most important develop-
ments of years in connection with
manufacturing of iron, steel, alumi-
num, gold, electroplating, etc. It is

‘ important not to metallurgists alone

but to engineers and chemists. It is
a general technical subject of very
great present day interest to any
study. S

 

Engineering Banquet.

On Saturday evening, November 18,
in the assembly room of Thaw Hall,
the Students, Faculty and Alumni of
the Engineering School will hold their
first dinner ‘of the year. Dinner will
be served promptly at six oclock. Dr.
Walter Riddle will act as Toastmaster
and the speakers will include Mr. Jos.
Trees, Joe Thompson and others.

Not only will this be an opportu-
nity for the display of good old Pitt
spirit, but it will give the members of
the various classes‘ an opportunity to
become better acquainted,-—a thing
which cannot but result in good to all
concerned. In the rush of our every-
day work at classes, ignorance of what
the other fellow is doing does, to a
very great extent, demoralize the unity
which should exist among us. I?
therefore behooves every student in
the Engineering School to be present
at the dinner.

The ‘Senate is acting as the com-
mittee in charge of the event. To
secure a ticket, see the Senator from

your class or J. W. Hallock, Chairman."

Pitt Student Band.

Important rehearsal of the band
will be held Friday night at 7 P. M.
All members desiring to qualify for
the band must report.

 

Band Elects Officers.

Pitt_ Student Band has elected the
following otlicers: Saul Sabad, "12

The Pitt Weekly requests all those
having any talent along poetical lines
to write a poem which they believe
would be suitable for an Alma Mater.

Debate Candidates.

The subject for the triangular de-
bate with Wooster and Allegheny has
now been chosen. All men interested
in this branch of college activity will

good on account of the heavy ﬁeld.
The result of the game was never

"team kept up its phenomenal brace,

which started with the Notre Dame

‘ game and played better football than

the visitors all the way. The handling
of the ballwas cleaner (if you’ can de-

'scribe the ball in this way in such a‘

game); the tackling was better, the

Connelly squirmed, slid and dodged

Pi-tt’s ﬁrst score. Crowe tackled the
Pitt game little quarter as he crossed
the goal line and a sprained ankle
forced his retirem_ent from the game
but it is though.t he will be back in the
game in a few days. Dewar took his
place and played a star game in the
remaining three quarters. Galvin
added a point by placing the mud cov-
ered pigskin directly between the up-
rights.

Dewar received the kickoff on the
3-yard line and pulled off a brilliant
run of 60 yards to Villa N_ova’sf '48-
yard line. The ball had passed the
other backﬁeld men and was bound-
ing along when Dewar scooped it
from the, mud and setsail for the far
shores of the enemy. He ran aground.
however, on the 48-yard mark and be-
fore he could get going again Crowe

managedto stop his progress and all -

seen at Forbes Field this year and the
next longest was negotiated by
Thorpe, who made 50 yards, but was

Harvard Beaten ,

Football followers were not sur-
pnised to hear that Harvard had fallen
the
team, the only surprise evinced being

before mighty Carlisle Indian

that the Cambridge eleven had scored
15 points. After seeing the Indians
perform here last month, many Pitts--
burghers stated that this team was one
of the strongest in the country and
would give Harvard and Penn a run
for their money, which has proven
true.. ,

Thorpe, v the wonderful half-back
played a brilliant game, scoring all the
18 «points himself. He scored the only
Indian touchdown, kicked the goal,
and also kicked four ﬁeld goals, rang-
ing from the twelve to the forty-eight
yard line. .. 1'

The season has slowly grown past
its infancy and now approaches its
prime, the smaller games are over and
the big ‘ones remain to draw our in-

terest, awaken new hopes and desires _»
for “no school on Monday!” The 1911

season approaches the ﬁnale and Old
Father Time already reaches for the
cord that loosens the curtain.
Saturday, two old-time rivals, Pitt
and W. & J., will meet in a clash that
promises t‘o be :1 ﬁ_ne one—even better
than the games of the past two years
in which the ‘ Red and Black has
bowed before the onslaughts of the
Gold and Blue. In 1909 Capt. Roe’s
team had little trouble in winning by
a. score.of 17-3 and last year Capt.
“Tex” Richards’ star eleven downed
the aggregation from Washington
14-0. . ‘ .
Comparative scores show the teams
almost evenly matched is Cornell de-
feated both by 6 points. Little can be
learned from this, however, as W. &-
]., according to some fans, deserved a,
score, and Pitt received a “ﬂuke” de-
feat at the hands of the Big‘ Red‘
team. The Red and Black received a
drubbing from _West Virginia ten.
(lays ago, which was a distinct sur-

prise to all, but the former team was.
without the s.ervices of three of their

best players, who were ruled from the

game by a technicality which existed‘

in the rules under which. the two
schools played. With these men in
the game W.&J. would

Goal Wins Victory

  

 

A play which occurred in the
Princeton-Dartmouth game last Sat-
urday will «be remembered for many
m'oons, as it ‘.‘took the proverbial cake”

' for luck. The teams were very even-

ly matched in strength, the edge be-
ing with Dartmouth and neither team
was at any time in a position to’ score
a touchdown. Late in the game De
W'itt attempted a ﬁeld goal from the
47-yard line. The ball rose not‘ more
than ten feet from the ground,
bounded several times and then tool;

a freak bounce between the uprights.

and over t'he cross bar. Referee Lang-
ford declared that a ﬁeld goal had
been made, as the rules states: “A
goal from ﬁeld is made by kicking the
ball from the ﬁeld of play over the
crossbar of the opponent’s goal in
any way except by a punt 'or kick-
off.”

A luckier play than this was never

emade in football, but one which ap-

proaches it in luck occurred several
years ago in a game between two
small college elevens in the East. The

. opponents were evenly matched and

no score had been effected by either
team until the last few minutes of
play. A trick end run was tried from
midﬁeld which completely fooled the
opposition. The halfback carrying the
ball, passed every ‘opposing player but
the quarterback, who tackled him so
hard that the runner was probably de-
layed by his fall. When he hit the

0 ground he fumbled the ball but rolled

clear of the tackler and instantly

‘jumped to hisfeet, gathered up the

ball and sprinted for his own goal. He
eluded one of his own men and scored
a safety or two points for the oppo-
sitiion. This was some luck!

PITTTSLIDES TO A 12.0 I
VICTORY OVER VILLA NOVA

- (Continued from Page 6)
.‘The beginning of the second quar
ter found Pitt with another chance to
score, but a penalty intervened. Pen-
dergast punted from back of his -goal
line, out of bounds to the 15-yard line.
Brown hit tackle for 4 yards, Dewar
added 3 more, but the aforesaid pen-
alty gave Villa Nova l5 yards and a
litttle hope. Galvin tried a placement

,but failed, and Villa Nova had the

ball on her 8-yard line.

An exchange of punts and a fumble
gave the opponents the ball on their
own 30-yard line. Two fake kicks
were stopped by Pitt’s great defense

for a kick was blocked by Blair.

Late in t‘he third quarter, Pitt car-

line, but lost in. on a forward pass.

yard line and in the confusion follow-
ing this play, Galvin and Curley were
detected roughing it and b'oth were
banished to the side lines.» Pitt had
the ball on the 30-yard line and De-
war escaped a ﬁeld goal, but the ball
went wide. , T

The third quarter found many sub-
stitutes on .both teams, Coach Thomp-
son, seeing the game was sewed up,
gave many second string men a
chance to show up and Coach Crolius
hoped his new material c'ould effect a
score.

In the early part of this quarter
Dewar sent a beautiful ﬁeld goal over
from the 20-yard line, .-but the ofﬁcials
would not allow the score because of
alleged holding by a Pitt player.

Dewar and Connelly performed bril--
liantly for Pitt and used good judg-
ment while in the game. Kernohan,
who was in at fullback, put up a high
class article of ball and deserves much
credit as he is new at this position.
Soles, who played full in the Notre
Dame game, was forced to remain on
the sidelines as he has a badly
sprained arm and shoulder. Blair
was back at hisold position and per-
formed in his usual manner. Graves
and Wagner played well at ends and

Discussion -on “That Reminds, Me” I

Provokes Lively
_ Discussion

 

The Science Club metilast Friday
and held a lively’ discussion of the
material presented by Mr. Jena, under
the head of “That Reminds Me.” The
title summarized the fundamental prin-
ciples of the association theory which
forms the basis of the new method of

examination of criminals, or others,‘

whose mental state presents a problem
too complex or diliiculrt for solution, in
the ordinary way. The discussion cen-
tered up-onthe data presented in Mun-
stenberg’s “On the "Witness Stand,”

which advocates the substitution of

the new system, of investigation for
the well—known “third degree.” ‘The

question naturally arose as to the at-.- _
titude of the courts toward this new A

system and the ast'onis'hing fact was

brought out that it was practically un- . - '

known among judges or lawyers, and
where it was known, was held in dis-
favor in spite of the high degree of
development to which it has been
brought by Munsterberg and Others.
The discussion was cut short, owing
t'o the time being limited. The next
meeting was set for Friday, November

24th, with the understanding that the .

speaker would be announced later.
-Everyone» interested in any ‘branch
of science is invited to attend these
meetings.

Forensic Society. .

The second meeting -of -the Forensic
Society for this school year wasvheld
in Chapel last Thursday afternoon.
The unusually large attendance was
indeed encouraging. The president
Mr. Stewart, -spoke at length, setting

forth the aims and ideals_ of the so- .

ciety, after which Prof. Fish ad-
dressed the members in what proved-
to be a most proﬁtable ‘discourse. He
impressed the students with the fact
that a most extraordinary opportunity
was being offered them by the so-
ciety along the line of public speaking
and debate.

Mr. Sorber was elected recording
secretary. The Program C‘ommitte‘e
announced that the question for de-

bate at the next meeting would’ be: ,

“Resolved, That the University of
Pittsburgh Should Enter an‘Active.

Protest Against the Saloons in Oak-,

land.”" The debaters are: Afﬁrmativ?
——Messers. Sabad, Boggs and-Sorvber.
Negative—Messrs. Allison, Colbert and‘
Quick. A
A hearty welcome is extended to all
students to be present at this meeting
and to become active members in the,

MISS JENNIE sMi'rH DEAD‘

Benefactress of University.

“The other Smith Sister is dead”
is an announcement that may not car-
ry much meaning to, the umlergradi1—
ate who knows only of the Schenley
Farm site of the .University, but to
those w'h'o were undergraduates on
the “Hill” it brings up a Hood of mem-
ories. The -Smith Sisters! The term
showed the -students’ affection for
them, and it was a recognition of these
sisters’ love for one another.

How h'omelike it made _the old
chapel to Freshmen, on opening day,
to see these dear old ladies, who
seemed to have stepped from an an-
cient fashion book. How the stu-
dents looked forward t'o the day when
they would come to open the Smith
Cabinet of blessed memory.

It is just a little over two years
since Mathilda Hudson Smith passed
away, and now Jennie is dead at the
age of eighty. At all times they gave
liberally to the University. The pic-
tures of the former Chancellors was
their latest gift. Large sums of money
were contributed Iby them to the Ob-
servatory, and to their interest is due
many-of‘ the artistic embellish-ments
of that beautiful building.

The University and the numerous
institutions in which she was\inter—
ested have suffered a second great loss
in the death of Jennie Smith——the

world» one of the lives it can least "af-
ford to spare. .

It is not out of place to quote of
her whatiher good friend Dr. John
Brashearrsaid on the occasion of, her
sister’s death for these two were one:
“In the death of this good woman,
Pittsburgh, and the world, has lost one

of its noblest philanthropists, for if

the giving of one’s self, as well as of
one’s means, is the highest type of
philanthropy———then will the memory
of this great soul be a sweet incense
to the hundreds of those who have
been the recipients of her kindly help
in their time of need.”

Let us hope that the day is not far
distant when the Universitywill com-
memorate in some ﬁtting way the
memory of its good true friends———the
Smith Sisters. J
