Student assaulted on Towers steps

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

As Pitt students walked in and out of the
Towers Friday night, a fellow classmate was
beaten up and knocked unconscious right in
front of their eyes.

David Orsborn, 20, was rushed to
Presbyterian University Hospital where he
was placed in the neurological unit. Officials
at the hospital said he was in serious condi-
tion yesterday.

Pitt Director of Public Safety Rick Boyd
said the attack took place on the steps out-
side Eddie’s cafeteria.

‘The student was attacked by two to four
individuals,” Boyd said. “We believe that
there is a good possibility that this attack is
gang relat .”

The student was knocked down and then
repeatedly kicked in the head. He hit the

ground and his head bounced off each step,
according to police.

“A great number of people were going up
and down the steps to the Towers [during the
attack],” Boyd said. “Some people had to
swing around the attackers. They just kept
on walking.”

A Pitt student who did see the tail end of
the attack ran and got police officers. There
was also a private ambulance service parked
on Forbes Avenue that assisted in bringing
the student to the hospital.

One reason Public Safety believes the
crime was gang related, according to Boyd,
was the “suspects were dressed very distinct
in outfits that matched.”

“It [also] appeared to be an unprovoked
attack,” Boyd said. “It was a random act of
violence.’’

Orsborn is a junior majoring in Film
Studies, according to his father, Michael

Orsbom. He is from Downingtown, Pa. and
he transferred to Pitt from West Chester
University last year. .

“He has facial fractures and a severe con-
cussion,” Michael Orsbom said. “He’s still
out of it and he’snot focusing on anything.”

David’s sister, Samantha, said that he
opened his eyes for the first time yesterday.
He has movement in his arms and legs, but
he cannot speak. However, he does commu-
nicate occasionally through moving his ﬁn-
gers, his father said. ’

“There is no brain damage or paralysis, it
is just a matter of waiting,” Orsbom said.
“We are going to take it one day at a time.”

Orsborn said he does not regret his son’s
decision to go to Pitt, but he was surprised
the attack took place in an area as crowded
as the Towers.

“It’s the most heavily traveled place on

Jena Bish, a Pitt fifth—year
senior studying abroad in
Kobe, Japan, was laying in
bed at 5 a.m. when Tuesday
morning’s earthquake hit and
the building began to shake.

“She sat upright in her bed
and then a dresser fell on the
bed right where her head
was,” said Jena’s father, John
Bish. “It would have ﬂattened
her.” 5

Bish said his daughter called
for only a couple of minutes to
say she and her host family
were safe. The building they
were in was still standing, but
had cracks in it.

Bish is one of three Pitt stu-
dents studying at Konan

she quickly says, but then con-
fesses, “I’m sure I am [an

Coffee is the second most
popular beverage in the
United States after soft drinks,
according to the National
Coffee Association’s 1993
Drinking Study. More than
half of all Americans, 53.8
percent, drink a coffee bever-
age.

The average consumption
per coffee drinker, according
to the study, is 3.58 cups per
day, increasing 5 percent since
1991. In 1993, coffee con-

sumption rose to its highest
point in nine years, 1.87 cups
per person.

“There are some people, I
swear, this is their life blood,”
said Skippy, a manager at the
Beehive Coffeehouse in

‘Oakland. He said he has

known people who have gone
days without food and only
coffee.

“It just seems to be the sta-
ple of the morning,” said Pitt
junior Todd Fertig, who sets
his coffeemaker timer so that a
pot of coffee is waiting for
him when he wakes up in the
morning.

Fertig said he began drink-
ing coffee when he was 11 or

12, but started on a regular
basis at 18. His family always
drank tea, he said, but he start-
ed with coffee because “it’s
easier to makea whole pot of
coffee than a cup of tea.”

Emma Storch, a first-year
student at Pitt, said she drinks
about 10 cups of coffee a day
and comes to the Beehive
everyday.

“I like the taste  I have a
supreme tolerance to caffeine.
I can have mass quantities and
still fall asleep,” she said.

Storch began to drink coffee
when she was in the fourth
grade. “I’m not sure why. It
was there.” She said she

Marquez, who is described as

Tuesday that Polish intelligence

The CIA and the White House

until the Polish stepped in.
Polish intelligence officers were
able to conduct a successful res-

They were also able to rescue
15 other people who were being

Study Abroad: You can
afford it!

(Susan Flasser is an intern at
the study abroad oﬁice and a
guest columnist for The Pitt
News.)

Many Pitt students may
miss out on the opportunity to
study abroad because they
believe the ﬁnancial responsi-
bilities are too great. In order
to make studying abroad more
affordable, students need to
know what exact resource
are available. In truth, approx
imately $170,000 per year i
awarded, just by various bod
ies at Pitt, to undergraduat
Pitt students for the purpos
of studying abroad. This fig
ure does not include ﬁnanci
aid amounts awarded or
variety of other scholarship
for which Pitt students are eli-
gible to apply. Here are the
facts every student should
know about ﬁnancial aid and
scholarships for study abroad.

First, regarding financial
aid, students who currently
receive ﬁnancial aid to attend
the University of Pittsburgh
can apply this money (with
the single exception of federal
work-study grants) towards
programs approved by the
Study Abroad office. If the
cost of a study abroad pro-
gram is greater than a typical
semester at Pitt, you can ﬁle a
Financial Aid Reconsideration

Request Form (FARR.)
Through this process, you
may be able to increase the
amount of a subsidized
Stafford Loan you can
receive, although any other
aid will remain unchanged.
You can still receive up to fed-
eral maximum of Stafford
loans (based upon the number
of credits you have earned)
but you may also be able to
decrease or eliminate the need
to make the interest payments
that are required if your loan

Honors College and The

is unsubsidized.
Consideration is also given
for those students who do not
already receive financial aid.
All students must ﬁrst ﬁle the
required financial aid forms
by the April 1st deadline and
then submit a FARR. For
additional information contact
the Financial Aid Office locat-
ed in Bruce Hall.
Scholarships are another
way to help finance your
semester(s) or summer
abroad. There are a variety of
undergraduate scholarships
offered by different programs
at Pitt including The West

to students who wish to par-
ticipate in summer, semester
or yearlong programs.
Eli gibiltity requirements vary
across scholarships, but most
are awarded on a combina-
tion of financial need and
academic merit. Scholarship
deadlines for summer pro-
grams are quickly approach-

ing (Jan. 27 for for Nationality

Room scholarships and Feb. 1
for general Study Abroad
Scholarship Fund). These
scholarships are attainable, as
many Pitt students will attest.
In fact, no one even applied
for the the West European
Studies Program Scholarship
for the spring of 1995.

There are various other
scholarships awarded to stu-
dents for study abroad pro-
grams. Specific program
scholarships are awarded to
students who participate in
programs sponsored by one of

campus,” Orsborn said. “He
was out with some friends, then
he was on his way to the
Beehive.”

Orsbom’s Resident Assistant
in Tower C, Joseph Hollist, said
he is very friendly but mostly
keeps to himself. He said
Orsborn is quick to say hi and
campus police said he did not
seem like the type of student to
provoke a fight.

Last October another Pitt stu-
dent was assaulted by possible
gang members. Jeremy Stamer,
a freshman, had three metal
plates bolted in his head after a

large group of males threw a
brick at him. A Pitt student at
the scene who helped bring
Starner to safety said she
thought the crime was gang
related.

“The result of this incident
will make us more sensitive to
the presence of gangs in the
area,” Boyd said. “We are going
to make contact with the gang
task force of the city of
Pittsburgh.”

Boyd also Said Public Safety
will be taking a more aggressive
approach to gangs on Pitt’s
campus.

The Pittsburgh Gang Task
Force could not be reached for
comment.

Boyd encouraged anyone
with information regarding this
attack to call 624-4040.

“no one really knows.”

According to McCoy, her daughter lived

The quake, measuring 7.2 on the open-

Coffee

became a hard—core coffee
drinker sometime in high
school.

Pitt junior Tom Woods, a
clerk at Tuscany Premium
Coffee on Meyran and Forbes
avenues, said he also drinks a
pot of coffee a day. “I don't care
if it’s hot or cold,” he said.

The caffeine no longer affects
him. He said he can drink
straight darkly roasted coffee in
the middle of the night and be
able to fall asleep right away.

But not all students depend on
or even like coffee.

Pitt junior Robyn Duchin said
she drinks an occasional cap-
puccino, but does not like the
taste of coffee. »

Pitt junior Cathy Cardiff said
she once drank one cup of cof-
fee to help her stay awake so
she could study for a psycholo-
gy test. But she doesn’t like the
taste, so she doesn’t regularly
drink it.

But Fertig said coffee is a
necessity and goes with every-
thing. He, however, is more
affected by coffee since he does
not drink 12 cups a day like
other hard-core coffee downers
who have built up a tolerance to
caffeine.

One night he used coffee to
stay up to write a paper for his
general writing class and got to
“that stage where my body
wanted to shut down, but it
couldn’t because it had too
much caffeine in it,” he said.

“It’s definitely an addictive
beverage,” said Skippy. “It’s not
dangerous. I haven’t seen any-
one ﬁbulate from caffeine over-
dose.”

affects coﬁee could have on

Witness sought

This past Friday, the problem of urban violence was again
brought to the heart of this campus. A Pitt student was attacked on
the steps of the Litchﬁeld Towers, right outside of the door to
Eddie’s.

According to Pitt Director of Public Safety Rick Boyd, the
attack was most likely perpetrated by gang members, though it
looks as though this was a random incident. Public safety plans to
coordinate their investigation with the Pittsburgh Gang Task
Force.

Currently, the victim, David Orsbom, is in serious condition at
Presbyterian University Hospital. While there appears to be no
brain damage or paralysis, Orsbom did suffer facial fractures and a
severe concussion.

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this incident is that there
were people around at the time of the attack. It occurred at 11 p.m.
on Friday. It is not as though there was no one around the Towers
at the time. Some witnesses apparently walked around the attack
and ignored the whole incident taking place. It was not until the
end of the attack that a Pitt student ran to get police officers. A pri—
vate ambulance service on Forbes Avenue took the student to the
hospital. ‘

The apathy that is made into such an issue every Student
Government Board election is obviously much worse than anyone
ever imagined. It has degenerated into callousness. While perhaps
most of the students on this campus lack the physical courage and
capability to intervene directly, nonetheless, alerting the police
was the duty of anyone who witnessed the attack. Are we reduced
to a pack of dumb animals who, when they see a fellow member
of the herd attacked, just moveon out of concern for their own
safety?

One has to question what was going through the minds of the
people who witnessed this attack. To walk around something so
barbaric and do nothing shows that the cities are tuming into jun-
gles. Unless we take a stand against this sort of behavior, cities
will revert back to states of nature.

Part of the reason for community is safety. This campus is a
community of students who must do more“ than merely coexist.
Orsbom’s attackers must be called to task for their viciousness and
animalistic behavior.

Those cowards who saw the attack and did nothing should con-
tact Public Safety and make a statement about what they saw. It is
too little too late for Orsbom, but this would at least be a step in
the right direction. In the future, students should be aware of what
is going on around them and realize that they are part of a commu-
mty.

Director of Public Safety Rick Boyd said: “I would be very dis-
appointed if our students did not come forward to help us make
this case. We have a number of investigators working on this case
until we ﬁnd the people responsible.” Anyone having any infor-
mation should call Public Safety at 624-4040 and ask to speak
with an investigator.

Chinese stab/e under excessive freedom

ecently
in The
e w

York Times
( 1 / 9 / 9 5 ) ,
c o l u m n i st
 William Safire
wrote a piece
Columnist e n t i t l e d
Tony “Yeltsin’s
Dickensheets Tiananmen.”
The stupidity (if the title told me

  
  

right away‘ where th1S"”aIfICl¢ ?

was heading. In the article,
Saﬁre outlined the turmoil that
Yeltsin and Russia are currently
facing with the breakaway
republic of Chechnya. He stated
the fact that the Russians-tried

7‘ to negotiate with the Chechens

since they declared “indepen-
dence” from Moscow in 1991.
Basically, he said that Yeltsin
had no choice after an internal
coup attempt in Chechnya
failed. I agreed with him on this
point completely, but then he
began to compare the political
systems of Russia and China.
What came next was the same
often cited Western propaganda
nonsense: Russia is a “democra-
cy” and China is not, therefore,
according to Safire and the
many others who have no
understanding of present-day
China, Russia is more.political-
ly stable in the long-terrn than
China.

Safire’s thesis is based on two
points: 1) Russia has a free
press and freedom of speech;
and 2) China is continuing to
crackdown on dissidents. He
asks us to “consider the political
miracle taking place in Moscow
today.” His definition of a mira-
cle in Moscow is my definition
of chaos. Ever since Yeltsin
took power in 1992, I have said
that he is a dictator in disguise
and a throwback to the pre-
Gorbachev era. He's a rumored
drunk, has bombed the hell out
of his own parliament building
and it’s been questioned
whether or not he even controls
the military. According to
reports, Yeltsin is refusing to see
his reformist advisors, largely

because he is trying to save his

political career by placating I

those in the military and curry-
ing favor with those on the far-
right fringes of the political
scene. All of this is making
those in Russia’s “Near
Abroad” very nervous. Some
political miracle!

Next, Safire wants us to look
at the Russian situation and

 “contrast that democratic 

Jiang is the appointed succes-
sor, but that is usually the death
kiss in modern Chinese politics.
He also lacks military experi-
ence, but has been trying to
strengthen his position with the
military through increased
spending and promotions of his
supporters. My best guess is that
there will be a coalition of the
above leadersfor a year or two

~ { 'si1,f,;rr3til_na‘so___l§___lg§ider emerges. One

moil to the _.*facadg;_of-:=--‘stabilitys’-. .-utlrringv-thaiieﬁ.  certain of is that

in China. With the death of
Deng Xiaoping imminent, the
leadership is cracking down on
dissidents.” He goes on to say
that this behavior “mocks the
assurances of China’s Western
apologists that a market econo-
my leads to political freedom.”
How long is the American
media going to continue to
deceive themselves over this
exaggerated issue of “human
rights” and dissidents? First of
all, China has a population of
almost 1.2 billion people, most
of whom care little or nothing
about politics and everything
about improving their standard
of living. Even many of these
so-called dissidents are now
doing -business in China. Whose
people are better off? The
Chinese, whose living standard
has increased as fast as any in
the world, or the poor Russians
who have suffered through eco-
nomic “shock therapy” and
whose government is “democra-
tic” in name only? Only a fool
would refuse to believe that the
Chinese are better off.

As to the question of political
succession, no one knows what
will happen after Deng
Xiaoping dies. Throughout
Chinese history therehave been
struggles for power, but since
the death of Mao Zedong in
1976 these power struggles
have been accompanied by
much less violence. Even the
dreaded “Gang of Four” was
not executed by Deng. It is pos-
sible that China’s next ruler will
not come from any of the cur-
rent leaders of Li Peng, Jiang
Zirnin, Zhu Rongji or Qiao Shi.

there   no violent power 

struggle, civil war or a splitting
up of China. The reason is that
the Chinese simply have too
much to lose ﬁnancially by not
having a stable political system.
In 1992 alone, the Chinese had
$170 billion of foreign trade.
Which .br_ings us to Safire’s
comment about Western apolo
gists. E

Contrary to what Safire
believes, it is an indisputable
fact that a market economy does
help to foster political liberaliza-
tion. This pattern of economic
development first and political
freedom second has worked
throughout the East Asian
nations of Taiwan, Japan and
South Korea and to a lesser
extent in Singapore. While these
countries will never have the
style of democracy found in the
West of the excessive freedoms
of America, their societies are
clearly more stable as can be
seen by justlooking at the crime
rates.

This sociopolitical develop-
ment pattern is already under-
way in southern China. If eco-
nomic development doesn’t pro-
mote political freedom, why did
even the Chinese dissidents dis-
approve of America tying MFN
status to human rights? The
answer, of course, is that eco-
nomics and politics go together.

While I have some question
as to the sustainability of
China’s economic development
at its current level, I’ll bet on
China’s political system over
Russia’s anyday.

They epitomize the meaning
of the word underdog.

Yet there’s something that .
you have to like about the Pitt
men’s basketball team.

They are a group of young
players who simply never give
up.

If you have been to the
games or even seen the high-

lights, you know that Pitt has

had a chance to win most of
their games this season.

It’s amazing because the
Panthers have been outmanned
and outgunned by almost
every team that they have
faced.

But fortunately for Pitt, the
Ralph Willard system’ allows a
team to hide most of its defi-
ciencies by running, pressing
and heaving a huge amount of
treys.

The relentless attack has
hidden the lack of team speed
and rebounding that the team
has. 3

But unfortunately for Pitt, it
cannot hide the lack of man-
power.

This problem was glaringly ,
evident last week in the
UConn debacle.

In all my years of playing
and watching basketball, I
have never seen a 25-point
lead turn into a nine-point loss
in so little time.

Embarrassing? Yes.
Demoralizing? Extremely.
Time to pack it in for the sea-
son? Of course not.

The players simply ran out
of gas. The starters are averag-
ing a huge number of minutes.
When a player is tired, he
looks to the bench and sees it
littered with walk-ons.'Tired
players lag on defense, and we
all know that once the legs go,
so does the jump shot. That
explains why Pitt is shooting
40 percent from the field and
opponents are shooting 46 per-
cent. It seems almost impossi-
ble to win under these condi-

For anyone, the adjustment
from high school to college is a
big one, especially if the school
is far from home. For Erin
Bissell, the change was compli-
cated because she had to keep
up academically as well as go
to practice everyday for the
swim team.

“It was hard at first but the
members of the team really
helped me out,” said Bissell.

Bissell, who is from Virginia
Beach, Va., is a versatile swim-
mer. She swims four strokes.
They are the 400 and 200-
meter individual medley and
the 200 and lO0—meter breast-
stroke.

In high school she was heavi-
ly recruited by several schools.
Her decision to come to Pitt
was a difficult one.

“I have a Very close relation-
ship. with L my mother.
Whenever I have a problem

with anything, I call her. I also

talk to Kean (head coach
Marian Cassidy Kean). She
automatically knows when I am
having a bad day by my perfor-
mance in the pool. If my timing
is off, she questions if every-
thing is alright,” said Bissell.
Along with being a freshman
standout, Bissell is also a leader
in the classroom. Last semester
her Q.P.A. was 4.0, which land-
ed her a spot on the dean’s list.
“Erin is a leader on this
team,” said assistant coach
Julie Stein. “She is a passionate
swimmer with great work

Remember the most impor-
tant lesson you learned from
your little league days?

No, it
wasn’t to
k e e p
your eye
on the
ball.

 

Teamwork and a sense of
accomplishment? Oh, please.

The one thing you haven’t
forgotten since grade school
is to never mess around with
a winning streak.

Don’t change your style of
play. Don’t take a different
route to work. Never wash
your game socks.

Let’s hope that last one’s
not true. If it is, then the Pitt
Hockey Club may soon be
able to grow corn in their
skates.

Bissell, no ordinary freshman

Freshman swimmer Erin Bissell missed, Pitt's record for the
200 breaststroke by one-half of a second.

ethics. She is definitely one of
the finest athletes on this
team.”

Earlier this season, Bissell
was one-half of a second off of
the Pitt record of 2:21.21 in the

‘ 200 breaststroke at the_b_,Buffalo y
Invitational. .For this -reésori 3116;‘

many more, the coaches of the
team have great expectations of
her.

“By her senior season I
would not be surprised. if she
qualifies for the Nationals,”

rival CCAC at Neville Ice
Arena this past Saturday.
The victory was an impor-

tant one for the Panthers,

who now own a 3-1 division
record with victories over
Slippery Rock, Edinboro and
CCAC. It puts them into a
second-place tie with
Allegheny College, .just one
point behind division leader
Carnegie Mellon.

This rsetsthe stage for .a.
showdown with the Tartans

this Saturday at Golden Mile
Ice Arena in Murraysville.
The winner will have the
inside track on the division
championship as teams head

, into the second half of their

league schedule.

The important victory over
the Tigers was in many ways
advantageous for a Panther
team not operating on all
cylinders after a month-long
layoff.

“It’s been quite a while
since we’ve all played
together, and some guys
haven’t skated in over a
month,” Hockey Club
President Matt White said.
“We’re just a bit rusty. We
have to relearn what we
already know.”

said Stein.

“The_team finished fourth
last year in the Big East,”
Bissell said. “We are in a
rebuilding year right now. If we
finish any worse than fourth, I

  

   .1    
our team will be in good
shape.”

With the heart and the deter-
mination that Bissell has, the
swim team is once again on the
right track.

The long period of inactiv-
ity showed itself early, as
CCAC’s top line of center
iceman Joe Lacko, left
winger Brian Blum and right
winger Jamie Rohrer was
getting the best of the
Panther defense.

The Pitt defenders underes-
timated CCACls speed early
in the game, and the surpris-
ingly quick, Tiger offense
took advantage, by 9 peppering

» the Panther-net. with 19 shots
~ in the first period. of play.
“Our defense wasn’t really

usedto that kind of speed,”
head coach Dick Rizzo said.
“The guys were pinching up
on the play too often,_ and
weren’t able to get back and
cover”

It easily could have been a
disastrous first period for the
Panthers.

Instead, they were only too
ecstatic to be the holders of a
3-1 lead after the first 17
minutes.

The difference was a brick
wall between the pipes by
the name of Pat Kenny.“

der was impenatrable during
that crucial stretch when the

at the 1995 United States
Olympic Festival (USOF-
'95).

The USOF-95 will be
held July 21-30 in Denver,
Colo. The women's teams
will be selected from four
regional trials.

Bruce is in his 10th sea-
son as Pitt's head coach.
Last season his squad went
'21-10, its winningest sea-
son in 13 years.

Pitt. also established
a , single-season record
with 12 Big East wins,
and Bruce directed
Pitt to a third—place ‘ﬁnish-
ing at the National
Women's Invitational
Toumament. .

This year the Lady
Panthers are 9-4 and 3-2 in
 it

years on the.men's basket-
ball team.

‘way to counteract CCAC’s

speed advantage.

Kenny finished the game
with 34 saves on 38 shots,
but his critical saves on
countless Tiger odd-man
breaks in the first period
earned the coach’s greatest
praise.

“Pat Kenny was our num-
ber one star, without a
doubt,” Rizzo said. “He
made some spectacularjsaves
that really kept us in the
game during that first peri-
od.” -

“Pat did some unbelievable
things in net today,” White
said. “We really needed him
to step in and perform, and
he did. It gives us a good sit-
uation in net  (with) him
and Dan Bratkovich.”

While Kenny was standing
on his head in the Panther
net, Tiger goaltender Tony
Couzzi was having rough
time at the other end of the
ice.

With goals by Chris
Pickell, Travis Wills and Dan
Casagrande, the Panthers
took advantage of the oppor-
tunities given to them by
their own superb goaltend-

ing, and jumped out to a 3-0
lead with 7:15 remaining in
the opening frame.
_Kenny’s heroics in net
could not continue forever,
though, and the Panthers
began to shoot themselves in
the foot.

Penalties hurt Pitt all night,
as the Panthers found them-
selves shorthanded eight
times throughout the game.

After Wills went off for high
sticking with 4:44 remaining
in the first, the Tiger power-
play unit finally broke
through when Lacko grabbed
a rebound and snuck it under
Kenny to make it 3-1 with
2:53 remaining in the first.
The Tigers then cut the
Panther lead to one goal with
another power-play tally
1:46 into the second period.
With their lead slipping

away, the Panthers saved
their best for the most criti-
cal portion of the game.
After consecutive penalties
to Mark Zukowski and Brad
Rizzo separated by just 34
seconds, the Panthers were
left short-handed by two men
for 1:26 early in the period.
The Tiger power-play unit,
which had looked so domi-
nant in three previous
attempts, came up flat this

time, and Pitt capitalized
with two straight goals to
bump the lead back up to
three at 5-2.

The Tigers scored one
more goal to cap off the sec-
ond period, then another to
open up the third. However,
with not even three healthy
lines, fatigue set in and
CCAC was powerless for the
remainder of the game.

As it turns out, the game
was won during that short
stretch of one minute and 26
seconds early in the second
period.

But the situation is not as
bleak as it looks. There is hope
for this team and, for that mat-
ter, the entire program.

Before the year is out, look
for the run-’n’—gun Panthers to
pull an upset or two for the
simple reason that the senior
trio of Orlando Antigua, Jaime
Peterson and Chris Gant have
too much heart to let the team

sink into oblivion. You can be ..

sure that they will put together
a game in which they over-
come exhaustion and pride
carries their tired legs to victo-

And the future, as near as
next season, is bright to say
the least.

The highly touted recruiting
class will infuse talent, but
more importantly, bodies.

Willard will be able to shut-

tle fresh players into the game, ‘

allowing both the press and
the three-point shooting to be
effective.

Believe in the Willard sys-
tem; it can and will work. We
have seen glimpses of its
potential this year with only
seven players. Imagine what
will be possible with a full ros-
ter.

The sky is the limit.
