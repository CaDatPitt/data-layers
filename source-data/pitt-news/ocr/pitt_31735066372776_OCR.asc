Colleges Trying ToHe|p

Students Financially

In anticipation of the loss of
millions of dollars in federal aid
next fall, several of the nation’s
universities and colleges are
seeking alternatives to help

“thgir students pay tuition hills.

Some institutions, especially
private ones, are allocating
greater portions of their re-
sources to bridge thegfinancial
gap created by cutbacks in fed-
eral grants, loans and job
subsidies. ,
Carnegie-Mellon University
President Richard Cyert has
taken steps to generate extra
funds by taking a larger chunk
of money from endowment and
soliciting more contributions
from alumni. ’

- Cyert told the I’itt.s‘burgh
Post-Gazette that he thinks,
schools should be prepared to
accept their share of budget cuts
and - develop ‘other income
sources to make up tor them. He
has assured the CMU campus
that enough funds will be pro-
vided to meet every student‘s
financial needs through a com-
bination of grants, loans and
jobs, regardless of .what
happens on a federal level.

George C. Roche, III, presi-
dent of Hillsdale College, views
the proposed federal budget
cuts in student aid as beneficial
to private colleges and
universities.

“Frankly, I believe this will g
be a step forward for private

education in this country and
will provide a diversity to
higher education, which it has
increasingly lacked as govern-
ment has injected itself over the
past decade in educational
affairs,” Roche said in the latest
issue of The Chronicle of
Higher Education. “The schol- \
arships and the funding of
school will be quite as available
in the future as they have been
in the past, only with the dead
hand of governmept interfering
in the process.”

The prosp_ect of reduced fed-
eral assistance has spurred
efforts to establish new loan and
work-study programs in states
and at individual instituions.

Pennsylvania State Senators
J. Doyle Corman and James J.
Rhodes are co-sponsoring a bill
that authorizes the Pennsylva-
nia Higher Education Assist-
ance Agency (PHEAA) to sell
tax-exempt bonds, as an effort
to develop an alternative in stu-
dent financial aid programs.

According to the bill, the pro-
ceeds from the bond sales would
be used to fund Pennsylvania
college loan programs. The
bill, which still must be
approved by both state houses,
would make loan funds availa-
ble to state students at interest
rates well below current interest
market rates and would be self-

, supporting, therefore not cost

Resolutionbenouncing N-Arms Sought

By ROCHELLE STEVWING

The Physicians for Social
Responsibility (PSR), at a hearing
last week, proposed that the Pitts-
burgh City Council adopt a resolu-
tion denouncing nuclear
armaments.

The resolution, drawn up by the
Pittsburgh branch of the PSR,
states that “The sole means of pro-
tecting the citizens of Pittsburgh
from nuclear warfare would be for

‘nations with nuclear armsito des-

troy those arms and renounce their
use.” ’
To implement this plan, the
PSR resolution suggests that City
Council denounce the Federal
Emergency Management Associa-
tion’s (FEMA) evacuation proce-
dures, and instruct public safety
officials not to cooperate with
FEMA's evacuation plan.

‘City council should, according

to the resolution, inform senators,

Washington representatives and
President Reagan of the resolution.
The proposal suggests that council
urge Reagan to “take initiatives
toward stopping the buildup of
nuclear weapons and reversing the
arms race, and to conduct urgent
and open negotiations between the
United States and its allies and the
Soviet Union and its allies, for the
purpose of dismantling nuclear
arsenals and renouncing the use of
ntrlear armaments forever."

Several PSR members addressed
the council in an effort to persuade
it to adopt the resolution.

The primary function of the
PSR, according to member Dr.
James Reilly, is to study the effects
of a nuclear attack upon the United
States,” with emphasis on the med-
ical consequences.

‘ Dr. John Townsend, a Pitt phys-
ics professor, used aluminum cans

, [0 demonstrate hOW a nuclear reac-

tion occurs between a stream of
neutrons and plutonium.

He explained the relationship
between a nuclear weapon and
dynamite. “The modern wea-
pons.” said Townsend. “in order to

replicate their explosive power, we
would need one million tons of
TNT.”

Townsend said that one meg-
aton of TNT would equal the size
of the Cathedra_l of Learning. “The
result of a one megaton weapon,
ignited at its optimum height
above the point," said Townsend,

would exert _a_, force of 30 to 40
pounds per square inch.

He noted that the destruction
caused by such an explosion would
level buildings over a three mile
radius. Included in this radius
wouldbe the areas of Wilkinsburg,
Etna, Crafton and Dormont.

Shortage Of
urses Opens

Options In Field

By KATHY GIDEON

For Pitt nursing students, the
current nursing shortage will
mean more career options and
improved working conditions.
according to several area nursing
schools and hospital administra-
tors.

Currently, 1.4 n1ill_ion nurses
hold licenses in the United States,
while nearly l0,000 positions
remain unfilledfi according to a
report by the American Hospital
Association.

The report said, however, that to
attract more nurses to the field,
working conditions are slowly
improving. Average salaries have
been slowly rising—a nurse in
Pittsburgh receives an average
salary of $18,700 a year, according
to the report.

And many hospitals, including ”

West Penn, are offering more flexi-
ble and convenient work shifts.‘

For the future, nurses with spe-

cialized educations will have an

edge. Dean Enid Goldberg of Pitt's
nursing school said that Pitt's
school of nursing is currently over-
enrolled. There have also been
increases in the number of nurses
enrolled in master's and doctoral
programs.

This specialization is becoming
increasingly important, said. Jane
Bulger, coordinator of staff educa-
tion at West Penn Hospital;

“The profession is becoming
much more specialized," Bulger
said. “There is a great need for
nurses with special skills."

Bulger ‘said that individuals
planning on making nursing a
life-long career should pursue a
degree instead of just completing a
nursing program.

While, many hospitals still offer
equal-entry level salaries for nurses
regardless of their undergraduate
education, there has been a grow-
ing trencl to differentiate salaries
for iitirses with degrees, Bulger
said.

Profile: Wesley Rohrer, University Senate President

Wesley Rohrer ’

By JEFF RUSSELL _

Wesley Rohrer believes that
Pitt faculty have a right to be
heard.

With‘ this ill mind, the asso-
eiate professor of _me(‘hanieal
engineering worked to improve
communitation between the
administration arid the faeulty
during his terln ofoffiee as pres-
idellt of tlle University Senate.

Now tha is tern  coming
to an end, )lll‘('l'  time to
reflert on the progress of the
polity-‘mal<ing body and roll-
telllplate his arhadeulie futllre.

Rohrer said duritlg his lerln
the aeeompli.‘ nents by the
Senate inelut tlle initiation
of steps to itnprove communi-
eatious between the faculty and
the university’s administration.
He listed several other
areomplisllments: V

0 “The aeeept' ,1’ by the
board of trustees the early

retirement plan for tenured,

faculty.”

0 “The itnplementation of
the rergommendations of the
Provost's Library Task Fortie,”
whirh calls for reorgani'1.ation
of tllepresetlt library manage-
ment system.

0 Some advances were made
in “helpillg the lo ‘—range
planningdone by the ' nl_itlg
atld Resource Management Sys-
tem (PRMS) proeedllre to work

lnore smoothly." Rohrer said.

O l“inall\j. he said that the
Senate “sponsored sortie publie
dislllssions of the Planning
\\'orl<sllop held at I.al<e \'iew
alld of the problems that are
foreseen in the future regarding
finaneial support of higher
edueation."

Rohrer then noted ' there
are three tllain prob tns that
have yet to be resolved. The first

of tl1ese‘problems is the pro?
ll\

posal to rewrite the Universi 1'

Senate bylaws, nlrludlng a

ehange ill the romposition of
blv

the farulty assent .

The seeond problem involves
the "effort t, get the kind of
information i‘ n the adminis-
ttratioll» that will make the
blldget more llnderstandable to

the faculty." :4
The filial and most (‘ontro-

versial problem involves the
proposal establishing guide-
lines for the movement of
faeulty fronl tenure sue’ to
non—tenure stream. “We l’t
foresee an end to this problem
yet. The Senate will continue to
work on this,” Rohrer said. The
proposal would allow faculty to
be telnporarily suspended from
tenure stream if serious prob—
lems would arise to prevent
attainment‘of tenure.

“I probably support the
proposal rather than “oppose

' ' Rohrer said. “If we (‘are-
' y delineate the (‘ll'(‘lllllSl£ll1-
res under \\'lli(‘l1 it (an be done,
we ran monitor the situation
better.” A

Regard‘ ‘‘ the formation of
the Utlit Farul 1’ Rohrer
said. “I don't think 't in my
present position I (all make
judgements on their opinions
and beliefs.”

Rohler definitely believes
that it is important for faculty
to be involved and to be heard.
He believes that the University
Senate “has represented the
farulty voiee much better than

the faculty realiI.es.'V' He also

said that the University Senate
is “the best way to get

' involved."

Lookit ‘ into the future,
Rohrer  i that the goalsofthe
Senate will probably be the
same in the near future as they
were this year. These goals are
to increase faeulty involvement
and to improve (‘()tItmttlli(‘2t-
tions between the administra-
tion and the rest of the
university's entities.

Rohrer said that he plans to

remain aetive. He ran for his.

economic and social consequences

A of nuclear war, saying that society.

as we know it, would be desti'oye_d
if such a war would occur and il his

projections were correct.

Dr. Ronald Stone, a professor of
social ethics at the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, spoke
about community values in the
event of a nuclear war.

Stone said that he believed there
would be no community left after a
nuclear war and therefore. no
values. He said that the destruction
of the host in Catholic churches
and the Torah’ in synagogues
would be a sin that may not be
forgiven.

Reilly spoke on the survivability
of a nuclear war. He told of
to evacuate and
called those plans impractical.

FEMA estimates that it would
take two weeks to evacuate Pitts-
burgh. Reilly pointed out that
FEMA relies on private transporta-
tion to evacuate and that our
bridges, highways and autos are in
disrepair. What would happen,
asked Reilly. if one or more cars
should break down or run out of
gas during an evacuation?

Reilly also questioned FEMA’s
theory that we would have advance
notice of a nuclear attack, thereby
allowing us time to evacuate.

Colleges

To Help ....

_ continued from one
taxpayers anything.

Several colleges will begin
lending their money to parents
or students in the fall.

The College of Wooster
recently set up a loan-to-parents
program, offering up to $3000 a
year at 14.5 percent interest
effective next year.

Other colleges and universi-
ties, not sosure of the extent to
which their student aid pro-
grams caii expand, have taken
safety measures.

Wesleyan University, con-
cluding that it had to limit the
expansion of itsiown student-
aid program, recently ended its
long-standing policy of admit-
ting students without regard to
their ability to pay tuition.

Although the exact amount
of federal cutbacks is not known
lit-cause the proposals must be
first passed by Congress, there is
little doubt that it will be signif-
icant decease.

Another’ certainty to take
place this fall is the double--
digit increase most college stu-

dents will find in their tuition 
' bills next fall. ’

A recent survey taken by the
American Association of State
Colleges-and Universities indi-
cated that next year's tuition
rates are expected to rise by 15
percent or more in at least seven
statesand by l() or I4 percent in
at least ll states. Reasons cited
for the increases_included iiifla- 1
tion and inadequate state
appropriations. .

Pitt _students, » specifically,
have already been assured by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar that
next fall will see a tuition hike
“along the rate of inflation."

The bike can be attributed, in

part, to the fact that Gov. Dick s V

'l‘hornburgh allocated only
$78.2 million. or a 9.6 percent
in'crease to Pitt in his proposed
budget for fiscal year 1983.‘
while the university requested
$85.5 million or a l-1.5 percent
iiicrese in state support.
Not all colleges and universi-
ties will revert to a ttiitioii
increase next fall. as evidenced
by Antioch University, which
aiiiioiiiicetl last month that it
will hold tuition rates in 1982-
83 to this year’s level.
“At some point, we all must
draw, the line," Antioch Presi-
dent William Birenbaiim told

The (lhronicle of Iliglicr E(lll- ‘

cation, “or we will simply
segregate our colleges and uni-
versities according to economic

class.”

  Opinion

, Reporting Eh
  The University

 

Yale University has come up with a rather unique way
toget the government off its back when the university
participates in federally-sponsored research projects: it
declines to take the money, which recently meant the
forfeiture of a $33,000 National Science Foundation (NSF)
grant. judging from the lingering conflict that has been
taking place between the government and universities
over federal reporting requirements for research, Yale's
action was a step in the right direction toward graphically
illustrating the cost and unnecessary intrusiveness of the
reporting requirements. .

At issue is the Office of Management and Budget's Cir-.

‘ cular A-21, a requirement that university professors con-
ducting research with federal funds file “effort reports"

A listing the use of their time spent on teaching, research,
advising and other activities sponsored by the funds. Aca-
demics complain that not only is A-21 a form of indirect
pressure by the governmentjwhere it shouldn’t be pressur-

‘ ing, but the time spent detailing their activities could be
better used in more scholarly pursuits.

Yale declined the NSF grant after Serge Lang, a profes-
sor of mathematics, said he was willing to certify that he
had correctly spent the funds for the final year of his
three-year NSF grant on number theory research, but he
would not submit the effort report detailing his activities.
Although Yale is the first university to have taken such a
measure, it is doubtful that other universities will follow
in Yale's footsteps, particularly in a time when funds for
education are declining in direct proportion to the
amount of demands for those funds.

()MB proposed revisions in A-2| in _]anuary,iwhich, -

among other things, would only require that researchers
document the amount of time they spend working a
federally-sponsored project. These revisions, although far
from achieving the total removal of bureaucratic intrusion
into the activities of the nation's universities, are neverthe-
less a step in the proper direction.

Despite the obvious aversion to federal reporting
requirements on the part of academics, it should be
remembered that some degree of accountability is iieces-
sary when tax dollars are_ at stake. Thequestion then
becomes how much accountability and in what form.’

Pitt is no‘ exception when it comes to problems with
complying with A-21. In fact. the university had to return
approximately $800,000 to the federal government a few
years ago because of poor records that were supposed to
have been detailing the use of almost $20 million in federal
funds. Chancellor Wesley Posvar, in his annual statement
to the state legislature for this year, writes that “coin-
pliance with these and other new reporting and record-

keeping requirements imposed by ()MB Circular A-21 ’

alone areexpected to cost the university $1.5 million to $2
million over the next three years."

Recognizing the confusiiig—and controversial—nature
of the reporting requirements, Pitt administrators organ-

ized a series of seminars in December to aquaint faculty,

and staff with the requirements. Hopefully. those same
faculty and staff put aside their simmering tempers for
long enough to hear what was being said so they won't
waste more time than necessary in the future when comp-
lying with the regulations. _ _

“We may win someday, but we haven't won yet. So
whether we like it or not.'it is a requirement and we have
no choice about it. We're simply going to have to make the
best of it," Jack Freeman. senior vice chancellor for
administration. said recently.

Winning that battle against A—2l and other federal
reporting requirements should not mean doingaway with
the surveillance and monitoring of public funds. Rather,
the battle will be won when there is an effective and
acceptable compromise between the rightiof a citizen to

__ know where his money is being spent versus the right of
another citizen tojustify that the money is being spent in a
responsible and worthwhile manner‘.

Mud-Wrestling a ‘Degradingspectaclefg

Dear Editor:

This is in response to a spectacle
which I was unfortunate to have
observed on April I, 1982. As I
approached the Quad in the even-
ing, I heard someone speaking
through an amplifier and heard a
large crowd of people; I assumed it
was a concert or some such recrea-
tional activity. To my dismay,
h'owt-ver, as I entered the Quad I
eticouiiterd a mud-wrestling cori-
test being conducted, according to

. three of the. earlier participants, by .

residents of Lothrop Hall (the
equipment apparently had been
obtained under the auspices of this
fine university). The announcer
was delineating the various physi-
cal attributes of one “Boom Boom”
and her opponent, whose nick-
name I have since forgotten. As
these two students of higher learn-
ing wrangled in the mud-, the
announcer was heard to bellow,
“Come on ladies, let's get those
clothes off; after all, that's what
we're here for!”

This was one of the inosi degrad-
ing spectacles I have ever seen. In at
least two respects it was utterly
repulsive to me and I hope to others
who encountered it. First, it seemed
inconceivable to me that two pre-
sumably mature women (this, of
course, proved to be a rebtittable
presumption) would subject them-
selves to such degradation as per-

. sons and to such gross exploitation

as members and representatives of a
group in our society which has
worked so hard and has made such
great strides toward extinguishing
not only that sort of degradation
and exploitation in fact. but also
the mind set which is its promulga-
tor. Second, I was much grieved
that students of higher learning,
presumably of higher than average

intelligence and social awareness

(another rebuttable presumption)
would find recreation in such deg-
ratlations and mindless pursuit of
happiness. There was neither sport
nor art in this activity; the specta-
tors seemed to gain pleasure only
from greater and greater degrada-
tion of the women in\'olved.

iii! LANCE BRITTNEY

Last weekend's NCAA men’s
gymnastics championships at
.Nebraska provided a sign of opti-
mism as well as a fine ending for
two of Pitt's top gymnasts.

The Panthers’ two representa-

tives, Bob Besong and Dave Smith,
each displaced “exceptional” per-
formances, according to coach

Frank D’Amico, but both were
unable to acquire All-America
status. '

“Both Bob and David hit their
routines. It was probablv the best

_sa_i§l D'Amico.

of some of the world's best
tumblers on the floor exercise. His
routine was clean and precise.
However, the judges’ scores only
amounted to a comparatively low
9.3.

“Bob stuck his double pike
somersault like a knife, better than
anyone did in the entire meet,"
commented D’Amico.

Sophomore Dave Smith, one of
the vEast’s strongest tumblers,'exe—
cuted a fine routine filled with risk.
Smith's score of 9.2 which earned
him a 21 st place, also did not reflect
his excellent performance, accord-
ing to D’Amico.,

The coach said a number of fac-
tors lead to the Panther’s “low"

scores. -One was the absence of the ‘

entire Pitt team. “Without the
whole team there, it was hard to
make a good impression on the
judges,” D'Amico explained. P

Another element that affected
the scoring was Pitt's llth place
seeding. This selected rotation
would have been the perfect spot if
it had not been for the presence of
the Nebraska Cornhuskers, who
were seeded directly ahead of Pitt’s
two-man team. Nebraska, two-
time defending national cham-
pions, has a roster jammed with
()lympic—caliber gymnasts.

After the Cornhuskers qualified
four gymnasts for the floor exercise
finals on Saturday night, both
Besong and Smith's chances of
claiming All-America were
diminished.

“Going up right after Nebraska
created a hinderance. If it hadn't
been for our seeding, we might
have pulled ahead." D'Amico said.

In the sport of gymnastics, where
the judges’ discretion makes the
decimal outcome, it is necessary to
“make 21 big name for yourself" to
win. according to l)'.>\mico. This is
another factor that the Panthers
unfortunately lacked. Without a
big name it is nearly impossible to
capture the judges attention, said
D'Amim. Making Pitt 21 big name
in the world of gymnastics is
D'Amico's ambition; he feels that

Hitters Poun

Towson

By DAVID OLSON

The Pitt Panther baseball team
exploded for 26 hits, including
three home runs, to pummel visit-
ing Towson State, 21-9 Friday at
Pitt's Trees Field.

The Panthers, who now sport a
modest three-game win streak after
losing their first six games, have
now scored -41 runs in those three
victories, for a gaudy 13.6 average
per game—a figure that has made
Pitt Coach Bobby Lewis temporar-
ily forget about his inexperienced
pitching staff.

Senior Darrell Gissendanner,
who started the game in center-
field, set the tone for the game in
the early going with a first-inning

grand slam. He also scored in the

third inning after singling, steal-
ing second and crossing the plate
after a single by freshman Paul
Westwood.

On a day of many batting stars—-
everyone in the Pitt lineup got at
least one hit—other offensive
standouts were junior catcher Tim
Schwadron, who had five hits in
six at-bats, and senior designated
hitter Mike Fitzpatrick, who
homered to lead off the fourth
inning and scored a r_un in the

sixth. Mike Horew, another fresh-
man, had a two-run homer in the
fourth.

“We were just awesome. They
couldn't seem to get us out,” said
Lewis. "Everyone was just playing
well for us." i

liven though Towson managed
to T score nine runs, Lewis was
pleased with the pitching of starter
Steve Anderson, and reliever Marty
Garda, a freshman who pitched the
last four innings. Although origi-
nally expected to be the Achilles
Heel of the team, the Panther
pitchers have performed well since
coming north. In threegames, the
staff has surrendered only 11 runs.

‘TBoth Anderson and Garda
pitched well. Our whole staff is
rounding into shape,” said Lewis.

The Panthers were scheduled to
visit Morgantown Saturday for a
doubleheader with league foe West
Virginia, but both games were can-
celed due to inclement weather.
The games are expected to be
rescheduled sometime this week,
according to Lewis.

Today the Pitt team is slated to
visit Akron for a doubleheader, but
the cold weather and threat of snow
may force a cancellation. If so, it
would be the third doubleheader of,

Duquense, of course, but il he goes
to either, I wouldn't mind," big
brother john Moore says.

Lloyd Moore has not only the
coaches of both Pitt and Duquesne
drooling over him, l)ut also basket-
ball fans in the Western Pennsyl-
vania area. The same fans who
watched Larry Anderson go to
Nevada-Las Vegas, watched Bill

Varner and Ron Rowan go to ‘

Notre Dame and who watched
Marc Marotta go to Marquette.
They are tired of seeing local talent
in far away places.

“I won’t make my announce-
ment until later in the week, but
the fans feelings will not affect me.
I will do what I want," Lloyd
Moore says.

The Rou-ndball game is minutes
old when Lloyd Moore receives a
pass from Upper St. Clair’s joey
David. Moore takes a few dribbles
then launches his huge mass
toward the rim. The ball comes
crashing through the floor while
Moore pumps his clenched fist in
the air. I

This particular play reflects why
Moore is so cherished and in some
places disregarded. He was down-
court by himself because he had not
gone back on defense, the reason
being that he was tired.

“He hasn't run up and down the

_ court in high school. He’s out of

shape and the offense has to wait
for him to get downcourt. He needs
to lose weight badly,” a basketball
observer said of Moore.

"He is a scorer, no doubt," Pitt
assistant coach Reggie Warlord
said.

the end of the play is but a hint of

gets into position and gets the ball.
He fakes right, spins and puts the

fooled. Moore appears caught on
the baseline.

He jumps, with Benjamin his
shadow. He p.alms the ball, and
extends his arm outward, away
from Benjamin. Moore’s body
shields Benjamin from the ball.

ication, the Panthers will be as
11' yhly regarded in the gymnastics
ﬁlm as they are in football.

The national champion on the
floor exercise was Nebraska's Steve
Elliot. This is the second straight
year Elliot has captured this title
with a superb 9.9 performance.
Elliot, an explosive tumbler, ended
his routine with a triple-twisting
backward somersault into an
immediate front somersault. He is
thetmly gytnnast to "even attempt
-such moves.

For Besong, this was his last per-
formance of his college career. To
say the least, it was an ending.
However, for sophomore Smith,
 trip was just a beginning.

"Dave will definitely -make
nationals next year-—-there is not a
question in my mind. He knows
what he needs to make All-
America, and I know next year he
can do it,” D’Amico said.

This was Smith's second trip to
Nationals. Hopefully next year.
three times will be an All-America
charm. "

D'Amico has organized a tough
schedule next year" which he says,
“will rock the East." This schedule
is definitely the roughest lineup of
meets that the Panthers ever faced.
However, in order to make Pitt 21
national name, this tough schedule
is a must, said D’Amico.

 1982 GRADUATES

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

A year after a summer of dis-
content and squabbling in
paneled board rooms, a farce of
a playoff format in which only
the dollar emerged as the true
champion, and a series of labor
relations that added tedium to a
game already badmouthed for
its paucity of action, baseball
has the gall to beat its chest and
proclaim it’s ‘back!’

That snoring you may have
noticed-is from many former
fans who no doubt discovered

last summer what many already"

suspected—people can do with-
out the self-proclaimed
“nation's pasttime."

As the big league season
swings_ into action today it
would be eminently fitting if
the normal sounds that punctu-
ate a ball park—-the popping of
well-oiled mitts, the crack of the
bat, the bellowing of the home
plate umpire—were the only
sound in the park. ‘ ,

Washington Post baseball
writer Thomas Boswell has
called the 1981 season “the year
baseball was stupid.” Beano
Cook, former Pitt sports infor-
mation director, had a more
acerbic comment on the sport
when he found out baseball
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn
had given the American hos-

tages ilife_time baseball passes

after their release from Iran.

“Haven‘t they suffered
enough?” Cook quipped.

Haven't we ail? For anyone
who has filled his summer after-
noons listening to game broad-
casts, misappropriated his
piano lesson money for bus fare
and a general admission ticket
to a major league game, or
fallen asleep listening to West
Coast games well after "bedtime
on a smuggled transistor radio,
the bleating, bemoaning_ and
crybabying by today's owners
and players alike is no cause for
celebration when it resumes.

I don’t have much romance
for the past—I don't have much
of one——but it seems things
were better then, before the
mesomorphs in doubleknit had
to worry about investment port-
folios, before the owners
became reported on as much on
the players themselves and
before greed became the pro-
vince of both.

Then, whether out of naivete
or just a poor memory, the per-
sonal recollections are of play-
ers complaining more often for
a lack of playing time than pay-
ment periods.

Recruting Trails . . .
Pitt coach Roy Chipman has to

start thinking about Upper Sta

Clair guard Joey David. Chipman
and his staff were waiting for the
Roundball game to see how David,
2- 6-4 slizirpshriotei‘, would do
against high caliber competition.
They need to see no more, as David
not only cracked double figures but
passed off handsomely.

The only problem is that David
isn’t thinking about Pitt.

“Right now it's Ohio State. Pitt
‘hasn’t really come after me, and
Ohio State has been nicer to me.
They're being outrecruited, right
now,” David said.

Even though his father played
for Pitt, David said he would turn

anyoiie

down a scholarship offer from Pitt‘

right now. Of course, Chipman
and his staff will probably go after
David full force after his Roundall
showing. -

had been covering, appears headed
to George Washington. Webster

  
   
       
   
   
       
    
    
   

has made a verbal commitment to
George Washington, perferriiig to
stay at home to display his talents.
Keith Wesson, a 6-9 center from
Ohio, who “can post up better than
we have‘ right now,"
according to Pitt assistant coach
Reggie Warlord, made his official
visit to Pitt this weekend.

The word from insiders is that
Wesson is headed for Pitt. Sources
say that he enjoyed himself on his
visit and is prepared to sign with
Pitt. That would be a relief to
Chipman as his search for a center
would then be over.
Kentucky’s 6-5 first team All-

State guard Bryan Mitchell is still.

or Tennessee. For awhile it looked
like Pitt was the choice, but sources
