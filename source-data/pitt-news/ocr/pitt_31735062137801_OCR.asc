UNIVERSITY HAS  
GREAT OPENING

I Large Crowd at Formal

. Opening. Dr. McCor-
mick Speaks on
History of
.. School

The formal opening of the Uni-
versity for 1911-12 was held Wed-
nesday morning in Memorial Hall,
at 11:30. Every department of the
University was represented and the
great auditorium of Memorial Hall
was well ﬁlled. The faculty and
members of the Board of.Directors
occupied seats on the platform, while
the student body used the main seats.

It was exactly 11:40 when Chall-
cellor McCormick announced No. 45
as the opening hymn; following this
was the reading of the Scripture,

‘ than a_ prayer by Dr. ,r.IcClurkin',the
announcements, and Chancel1or\'Mc-
Corr.1ick’s address. '

The Chancellor expressed himself
as very much pleased with the at-
tendance on this ﬁrst formal convo-
cation of the year. He said that the
seating capa.city of thepbuilding W35

taken, the appearance of the I‘00m
from the platform was very inspiring-

Rooters Meeting
, Is Great Success

Large Crowd Cheer Practice Last
Friday—Men Parade to
Forbes Field

Last Friday _the first cheer practice

of this year was held on the steps of-

Thaw Hall. The steps were ﬁlled and
running over. Several upper class-
men and alumni remarked that never
before have there been so many men
present at a_ rooters’ meeting so early
in the season. The crowd was full
and running _over ‘with the famous
Pitt spirit,—the ‘spirit which gave to

-the University of Pittsburgh a team ’

which was not scored upon last year.

Cheer Leader Kirk put the men
thru the yells and several of the col-
lege songs. Then came short talks
from students and alumni. Hurst,
graduate manager, gave a short talk,
urging the students to pus'h the stu-
dent band- He said that if the stu-
dents did their best, the althletic com-
mittee would help them. Then fol-

lowed some more cheers, after which

the students paraded down to Forbes
Field to watch the practice. .
After cheering the team, collective-
ly and individually, Jo Thompson was
called upon by the boys. In a short
and snappy talk, Jo promised t'he stu-
dents that Pitt would have a ﬁghting
team which would never say die, no
matter what the odds. He urged the
men to..back up the team with all their
might, to root as they had never done
before. He said that any man could
yell when the team is -winning, but
that it takes the loya1‘roo_ter to back

— them up when they are losing. '

After Thompson came Judd Bruff,
one of.our famous old football stars,

now sheriff of Allegheny County. In"

a modest way he promised to do his
best to help Jo turn out a winning
team. The crowd then gave the
cheers all over again and scattered.

 

Evening School .
Enrolls Many Men

Up to the present time the enroll-
ment in the evening school has al-
most reached the .200 mark, with
many more still inquiring concerning
the courses given. It is probable that
many more men will enroll before the
season/is far advanced.

ferred to in the mayor’s letter.

pDr. Kerr moved the conﬁrmation
of Dr. Holdsworth in accordance
with the mayor’s request and Mr.
Hoeveler seconded the motion. Mr.
Babcock then spoke briﬂy on the
merits of the appointment, saying
that the city, the mayor and council
were all to be congratulated upon
the selection and upon the fact that

I Dr. Holdsworth was willing to under-

take the task. The University of
Pittsburgh, he said, had practically
searched the world to ﬁnd the right
man .to pla-ce at the head of its
School of Economics, and this was
a guarantee that no better man could

_ be secured for the work of the eco-

nomic survey. The motion was then
put and the mayor s appointment
unanimously conﬁrmed.

RESOURCES OF SCHOOLS
AT HIS DISPOSAL

~Dr. S. B. McCormick, Chancellor

of the University of Pittsburgh, was
-among the spectators in the lobby

when council was voting upon the
appointment. He would make no

A _ -‘comment but it is understood that

he regards the city as having made
a distinct advance in municipal meth-
ods by placing a work of this kind
under the control of a distinguished
educator. Dr. Holdsworth will have
the support of the University of

C Whose faculty he is :1. member and

practically its entire resources, will
be at his command for the further-
ance of the Work.

It is believed also that the educa-
tional forces of the city will line up

_to the same end.

It is known at all events that this
is the attitude of the Carnegie Tech-
nical. School, with_ which a number

ofeminent economists are connected.

They will co-operate with Dr. Holds-

. ‘_ worth and for the comparatively

small expenditure of«$5,000 the city
will‘ be rendered a service in the form
of an investigation, which if it. were
to be purchased “in the open mar-
ket,” could not be had for many
ti-mes this sum. I

When seen regarding his appoint-

.- ment last night, Dr. Holdsworth said
H that he will begin work at once. He

emphasized the statement that the
investigation will be carried on in a
spirit of impartiality and will be sub-

-ject to no sort of poltical or other

control. Dr. Holdsworth said:

A “There will be no delay in start-
ing the work. There are a number
of young men, thoroughly competent

-for the collection of statistics and
the making of the other ‘investiga- .

tions which will be ‘required, and
they will beorganizee: as a force and
the investigation begun at once. I
anticipate that for the work of inves-
tigation three months will be suffi-
cient and that for the writing of the
report another month will be all I
shall require. -

“I desire it to be generally be-
lieved that I enter upon this work
with an open mind and will be sub-
ject to no partisan or other control.
I will welcome suggestions and help
from whatever quarter they may
come. It has been "generally under-
stood that the investigation is not to
be a muck-raking affair, but at the
same time that we are to go after
the facts and that the truth is not to
be suppressed. ‘

’ “This as I undersand it, is what
the people hope, and this is what I
intend. I think I can safely promise
that the investigation will furnish the
basis for an honest boosting cam-
paign. Because ofthis hope and in-
tention, and while desiring the co-
operation of all who have the good of
the city at heart, I particularly hope
for the effective co-operation of the
recently organized Industrial Devel-
opment Commission.”

INDUSTRIAL COMMITTEE WILL
LEND ITS ASSISTANCE

.A. J. Kelly, chairman ofthe gen-
eral committee of the Industrial Com-
mission, was made acquainted with
Dr. Ho1dsworth’s expressed desire for
the »co-operation of that body last
night- and declared that it will un-
dpubtedly be given. ,The general
committee is to have a meeting this
afternoon at the rooms of the Cham-
ber of Commerce, and it is probable
that the industrial survey will be one
of the things considered. The. gen-
eral interest manifested in the com-
mission, and the "hope of the im-
provement of business conditions
through its agency which has been
aroused, have made it certain that
the inﬂuence of the commission is
to spread to every» section of the city
and to every department of business
and industrial activity.

So general is the interest in the-
hoped for projects of the commission
that practically every line of business

"severe attack of scarlet fever after
only a short illness. '

Mr. Lord spent a year and a half
in the Engineering Department of AJ-
legheny, departing in February, 1911,
for the University of Pittsburgh where
he contemplated completing his
course. During the su-miner he ac-
cepted a position‘ as foreman of a
crew of engineers on a job in Okla-

capacity’ that he contracted the dis-
ease to which he latersuccumbed,

Mr. Lord was one of the Owl Edi-

and students. His many friends will

NOTES FROM LIBRARY.

The Library of Congress has pub-
lished a list of “Additional Refer-
ences relating to Reciprocity with
Canada,” which supplements a sec-

tion on reciprocity with ‘Canada in

the general “List of References on
Reciprocity,” published last fall.
The additional references include
parts of books which have appeared
recently and articles in periodicals
down to the beginning of April, this
year. Speeches made during the

third session of the Sixty-ﬁrst Con-

gress are included, and some indica-

tion is given whether the speaker was '

in favor of, or opposed o the resi-
procity agreement. Lastly, special
§y_ess has been laid on the Govern-
ment publications dealing with the
subgect, issued by the United States,
Canada and Great Britain.

The additional references are con- .

ﬁned to the present reciprocity agree-
ment. ‘Those desiring material re-
lating to the previous reciprocity
treaty with Canada, the results
which grew outiof it, and the caues
which led _to its abrogation, are re-
ferred to the general “List of Refer-
ences on Reciprocity,” mentioned
above, pages 51-81. '

The list of “Additional References
Relating to Reciprocity with Can-
ada” will be distributed free to de-
pository and all other libraries on
our mailing list, while indivduals de-
sring copies may purchase them from
the’ Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing, Office, Wash-
ington, D. C., at 5 cents each.

COLLEGES SEEK DEBATES.

From the present indications, the,

University Debating team will not
lack a schedule this year. The col-
leges on our schedule before will re-
main. In addition, Notre Dame and
J uniata have written, asking._for de-
bates at these institutions. The de-
baters will probably accept one or
both of these» offers if sufficient can-
didates come out toigive us strong

LETTER, BOX

Sir: I wish to give a suggestion
concerning what seems to be an in-

consistency‘ in the policy of the 11-’

brary of the University.

Perfect quietness has been a rule
or the library -as long as I have been
in the University, and this rule has
been carried out very strictly against
the students. Many a" time, when
only talking very quietly to a fellow

student, I, have been invited to do O

my talking in the hall. . This was
perfectly right and I have no com-
plaint to make, but I have a com-
plaint to make on another score.

There is in use by the librarian a
great part of the time a typewriter,
which, to me, is far more disturbing
than a person talking quietly ‘for’ a
minute or two. For can you think of
anything more disturbing, when you
are trying to workiand study, thana
continual click, click, click, inter-
spersed with a ding, ding, every few
minutes. ‘

It seems to me that since quiet is
desired in the library, since the stu-
dents aremade to meet this desire
to the letter, that such typewriting
as must be done by the library de-
Dartment. should be done outside the
library. ‘ - ‘

A Constant Reader.

, October 9, 1911.
Mr. Editor.

Dear Sir: The recent neglect of
the “SoDh” class to- enforce the rules
that it has established f_or the, Fresh
has led to the comment of a great
many of the upper class men, as well
as the Fresh themselves. It has al-
ways been the custom of the ﬁrst
Year boys "to obey these rules that
have been made for them. Other

classes have done it, and why not,

this one?

It is the duty of the ofﬁcers of
this class to get their heads together
and to see that these rules are en-
forced. We look to them to take
theinitiative in this matter that we
may teach the Fresh the respect tha
this University deserves. 1

Sincerely yours, . A

University Has Great
 Opening

 

(Continued from Page 1)

Aversity was clearly shown, although
he also said that unless every year
was a better year than the one lie-
fore, the University could_ not be said
to be going as successfully as it

ought to» be.

The most wonderful growth of the
schooland of the city was next taken
At the time of the founding ‘of
the present Pitt (February 28,
1787), only a few log cabins, a few
houses and places of business were
scattered over the area‘ now compris-
ing Pittsburgh, in fact, there are more
students in Pittto-day than there
were people in Pittsburgh in’ 17_8_'l.
Not only is this true, but this won-
derful growth and the present size
and inﬂuence of: the University to"
day is but a glimpse of the University
of to—morrow. The University has a.
vast army of people to serve, Alle-
gheny county being as great as some
states in population. The question of
future equipment is the great D1'0b-
lem now to be solved, but by heart)’
co-operation of every one connected
with the,University—past and pres-
ent—that problem will be gone, for
then the University will be made
large enough to accommodate all and
give elbow room in addition.

_ The Chancellor further said that
we are living in the best period of
the history of the world, for now the
spirit of public welfare and living
for the community and your fellow-
men holds sway as never before has

been known.

The advantages of a “City Univer-
sity” wer next taken up b3’ the

iChancell vr. While the City Univer-

sity offers 'no dormitory life and
many other more or less attractive
features, it gives a man a chance to
get right down to good Practical
things. It gives a chance for ideals
of all kinds. It gives a man who has
but a limited time to spend in school
a chance to get as much as he can
of exactly what he wants.

Tht last topic taken up was the
matter of making the 125th anniver-
sary a success. The University W111
be given over to the city Without 3
condition. It will be available to
rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, white
and black and any other colors that.

,may exist. . The plan of having all

departments of the University On the
same campus is a novel one; ‘but the

2 time has come or- is close at hand

when the man who has taken medi-
cine as his branch of work will be
deeply interested in the man who has
chosen Law, or Economics or any
other course. To make the anni-
versary a great success and this Yea!‘
the best in the history of the Univer-
sity theestudents must work together
with all earnestness of Dllrpose. Unity

"of action is the Watchword. and by

following such a motto to the letter
we cannot fail to make this Year the
most fruitful in life of dear old P1tt._

Dr. McCormick talked to city
council last week and unfolded his
plan for its approval. At the same
time a resolution was presented,
asking the city to co-operate with
Mayor Magee in issuing a proclama-
tion urgingevery citizen to aid in
making the one hundred and twenty-
ﬁfth anniversary a great educational
event in the city’s' history. The res-
olution was unanimously adopted
and the chancellor assured that
whatever plans he was making would
be heartily endorsed. 
The chancellor told the council
that the "university was established

some 29 years, even before the city

was granted a charter. Since the
time the old Pittsburgh Academy
was started, it has grown into a fully
equipped and recognized university.
It is the plan now to raise, before
next February, a fund, of $1,500,000
to assure additional endowment and
the erection of new buildings to be-
come part of the magniﬁcent $10,-
000,000 group projected on the cam-
pus in the Schenley Farms district,
where already several handsome
buildings are accommodating the
University’s 2,000 students.

Chancellor
realize this fund by that time, and to
celebrate the event with the dedica-
tion of at least one new building, a
historical program, the presentation
of degrees, addresses by visiting col-
lege and Zeducational men, and a
great reunion of alumni. He told
the legislators this University is so
rapidly becoming’ an important factor
in the progress of the city, it is im-
portant that the municipal govern-
ment lend its encouragement to every
project affecting the educational pro-
gress of tne -city. Te was assured

The announcement‘ of Chancellor
McCormick «in Chapel last Wednes-

organized, was received by all de-

the’ students ever since the beginning

of the 1910 football seasonand dur-
ing the past week has burst into
ﬂame and we are to have a Student
Band at last! -
Donald 1. Kirk,’ ’13, has been
working all season among the stu-
dents arranging this organization,
and great credit is due him for his
perseverance and enthusiasm. .He
has recruited about 22 experienced

players and all that is now necessary -‘

is the money to buy several ofthe
heavier instruments, drums, _music,
etc., that are absolute necessities.
It is said that the Athletic Committee
will contribute half of the necessary
funds if the- students will give the
other "half, so you see, fellows, it’s

-up to usi!~ Isn't it better to have a

good band of our own than to pay
Nirella about ‘$350 a year to play at

more ‘spirit in" the cheering section
than Ea hired one and will put ‘ﬁght

into our teams when we are battling ,

against State, ,W. and J. and the rest

give a dime or a quarterr,‘the,re would

be plenty of money to keep the-band’

are collected at once, it is thought
that the band will help smother Ohio

Mr. Ralph George, .
Editor “Pitt Weekly.”

My Dear Mr. George:

As an aluminus and former editor
I am takingthe, perhaps, unwar-

ranted liberty of. writing to con-

glatulate you .upon what I feel sure

’must be your policy with regard to

the unhappy incident of the West-
minster game. Prudence may say
that it is better to forget such things
at once and Policy may attempt to
explain or to condone them, but 1
am one of, those who believe that the
facts should be known and that, if

they show us to have been in the

wrong, we "should make whatever
restitution is adequate.

Judging from the opinions of stu-
dents and alumni who witnessed the
incident and from my own observa-
tion, certain members of our team
wereguilty of conduct unbecoming
gentlemen and University ‘students.

-Whether the incident was a thing

of sudden passion or simply the cul-
mination of a series of minor_ con-
ﬂicts extending throughout the game,
I have no means of knowing. I can-
not think that ‘such action would
have been taken without provoca-
tion either. real or fancied; but
whether or not the act was provoked

- by aggression on the part of West-

minster ‘does not alter the funda-
menal facts ‘of the _case. Possibly
indescretion on the part of our OD-
ponents may be an explanation, but
it is certainly not an excuse.

One of’ the arguments most often

..brought_ forward in defense of foot-

ball is that it develops ‘generosity.

H fair play-, and self-control in those

who engage inVit. If this be true-—
as I believe it to be——-we can make
no defense on the ground that our

citement of the ﬁrst game, or that
they were simply retaliating for an

George Brown was kept from the
Westminster_ game by a— bruised
shoulder which was hurt early in the
season. He will be in line by next
Saturday, it is thought‘. ' d ‘

As a result of Saturday’s fracas
between the players, many football
knockers have gotten intheir share
of raps, and the old,’moth—eaten ‘fan-
vil chorus” has rung out against the
game from many quarters.

“Tex” Ramsdell said in a recent
article: “Of the second string col-
leges of Pennsylvania, State seems
to have the strongest team of the
lot, and bids fair to humiliate some
of the larger college teams,” etc.
We all know “Tex” is a good man in
the dashes, but doubt his ability as
a forecaster. * “

Butler, Cornell’s quarterback,
kicked two ﬁeld goals against Col-
gate, one from the 35-yard mark and
one from midﬁeld. On‘ account of
his ability in this department, Cor-
nell will be dangerous whenever she
has the ball in her opponent’s terri-
tory, as Butler may be able to put
one between the uprights. He scored
two ﬁeld “goals against Penn last
Thanksgiving. ’_ .

Bob Peacock, Dave Richards,
Leahy and several other last=year
men, were atthe Westminster game.

Connelly, a Butler boy, is putting
up a good brand of football at quar-
ter.‘ His elusiveness reminds one of
Miller, State’s quarter, but he runs
more towards the opponent’s goal
and less in circles than the latter.

Ashe, who played end for_ West-
minster, is ,a brother of the Ashe
boys who attend Pitt.

of its players, and even the conduct, given “The Silence” in the next game’

situation,

It is said the ‘

heartiness with which they respond-

ed to Cheer-leader Kirks’ timely call
for a “three times three-Westm.n-
ster” should absolve them from any
,blame, but the players who were

guilty of the wrong snould beidis-g

These men should be

as an indication that Pitt stands for
clean sport and means to have it, if
it. costs every victory and the team
itself. "

In line with the Student opinion
and with a prompt recognition_ of the
Pittsburgh’s athletic au-
thorities reprimanded those who
were concerned and issued a state-
ment in which they declared that a
recurrence of the troubleqwill be im-
possible.-in the future. ‘The most
signiﬁcant thing to note is that the
fray was the personal quarrel of in-
dividuals, in no sense supported or
endorsed by the" ofﬁcials or students
of either institution.

The action of the alleged police
force was ludicrous in the extreme.
A row of neatly dressed scare-crows
would have been just as effective in
keeping order, and far l'ess expen-
sive. I trust that no Pitt man de-
manded or had a part in the arrest
of Coach Gilderslieve. That was a
silly and unnecessary proceeding. To
those in the stands the valiant Dog-
berries of the Watch appeared to be

‘ in much the same predicament as the

young ladies of the Floradora Sex-
tette who were wont to sing “Well,
I guess Ivmust take some one and
it.might as well be you.” i

A Such an incident as that of Sat-
urday ‘hurts both the game and the
University. There are plenty of inal-
contents who welcome such a thing
as an argument against football and
college life in general and who see
to it that the facts are magniﬁed and
distorted to the ’nth degree. The
newspaper accounts of the game
have already brought intense J'0y t-0
Mollycoddledom. ' ’

Football is a game—not a pugilistic

encounter. It is designed to de-
velop men both physically and moral-
ly, and as soon as it fails in either
or both of these particulars it should
be abolished. I believe I voice the
opinion of our alumni and students
when I say that such occurrences as
that of Saturday must cease forever
at Pitt. If the University is, to ad-
vance, as I am convinced it will ad-
vance, to a higher and more useful

sphere of inﬂuence in the culture Of,

mind and body, we must take our
stand now for Truth and Fair Play.

»We have had enough of cave-man
ethics in the past. The Blonde Beast
is an anacrionism. Let us 30 f01"

commission provide that the com-
mission itself shall be brought to the
attention, during spare moments this
week, of those whose co-operation it

in prosperity promoting will sit at
coffee and cigars to devise means for
the furtherance of this work.

Most of the commission’s sessions
will consist of a. conference between
the members of the various sub-com-
mittees announced at the Hotel
Schenley banquet a week ago last
night. Several of. these consist of
only three or four persons. Their
meetings will be arranged informally,
and the -results of their work will be
reported at the executive quarters of
the commission in_the Farmers Na-
tional Bank building at the week’s
end.

Several of the committee already
have organized and have begun their
work for the industriai developing of
the Pittsburgh district. The com-
mittee of. bankers addressed a letter
yesterday to 99 of the leading ﬁnan-
cial institutions of the city outlining
the plans of the commission and so-
liciting the co-operation of those at
the head of these concerns. Organi-
zations also have been effected of
the committees of railway interests,
brick companies and the iron and
steel industries.

PLANS TO EXPLOIT CITY’S
ADVANTAGES TO BE MADE

This afternoon’s meeting in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce
will be attended by the real estate"
and property men of the Pittsburgh
district and those connected with‘
various miscellaneous interestsi too

numerous and scattered to classify
in separate groups. With respect to
membership it is the most important
of any of the sub-committees, being
composed ofabout 50 persons.

A. J. Kelly, Jr., chairman of the
committee, will preside at the meet-
ing this afternoon. This committee
piobably will subdivide itself at that
time into still other subcommittees
for the purpose of getting in touch
more effectually with the large num-
ber of persons in such industrial pur-
suits as fall within its class.

In the meantime, members of the
commission will be engaged in con-
ferences each afternoon this week
for the purpose of further perfecting
plans to be followed in exploiting the
various facilities and resources of
the Pittsburgh district. Most of this
work will consist of gathering such
data as may be used for advertising

.and promoting the district generally.

One of the most important of the
proposed undertakings will be the
providing of topographical and indus-
trial maps, intended to show not only
the lay of the ground in and about
Pittshburgh, but indicate also the
residence districts of the mill and
factory population, the location of
various industrial plants and such
other information as may be obtain-
able. Connected with this wgrk will
be the tabulation of factory and mill
sites. -

Later this information will be pub-

J lished in a pamphlet which will show

just what the Pittsburgh district is
to-day and what it should be. As a
single illustration, it is said, the
Pittsburgh mills to-day furnish 50
per cent of the raw material .that
go into the manufacture of. certain
products, while it supplies less than
one-half of one per cent of the ﬁn-
ished articles. To correct" this in-
equity of production is one of the
objects of the commission.

EVERYBODY Is PUTTING
SHOULDERS TO THE WHEEL.

The introduction of W. A. Donkin,
new general manager for the indus-
trial commission, to his duties took
place yesterday. Until Saturday Mr.
Donkin retained his connections with
the Allegheny COl1I1‘[.Y Light Com-
pany, which he resigned to take
charge of the movementintended to
bring about the commercial expan-
sion of the Pittsburgh district. After
one day in his new position Mr. Don-
kin was optimistciover the dutlook
for thecommission.

“It seems that the businessmen
are taking hold of the work of the
commission with the
making a go of it,” said Mr. Donkin.
“I have observed no disposition on
the part of any of them to hang back
and depend. on someone else. We
are only outlining our plans at pres-
ent, but we are meeting with encour-
agement on every side, and I feel
conﬁdent of the ultimate success oi!
our undertaking. ' -
