City witnesses
military review

Pittsburgh will again have an op-
portunity to witness the spectacle
of a military regimental review this
afternoon. Because of the city’s
isolation from any military camp or
fortress the Pittsburgh public sel-
dom has the chance to view any
type _of military training.

This afternoon at 1 o’clock in the
Stadium, Cadet corps of the ROTC
will hold annual review and in-
spection. After the three battalions
of the regiment pass the reviewing
stand, Major Clifford D. Hindle,
instructor of the Coast Artllery
units of Western Pennsylvania, will
inspect the corps. In the past few
years this inspection has resulted
in the award of an excellent drill
rating for the Pitt Corps.

Samuel H. Williams of the Univer-
sity’s biology department and as-
sociate director of the Lake Labora-
tory announced his warring intent
toward the biting pests of Lake
Erie’s summer beaches.

Warfare will consist, Dr. Williams
states, of studies of the breeding
habits of the pestiferous biting
beach ﬂy (stomaxys calcitrans)
and the brown-winged horse ﬂy
which sometimes make vacations
intolerable.

A large screened breeding cage
will be -‘-*-nstructed on the beach

Dr. and Mrs. Jennings are among
the earliest members of the center,
and Dr. Jennings has acted as ad-

viser to the Hillcrest Garden club

in its project of a wildﬂower trail
in Panther Hollow. He has lec-
tured at the headquarters of the
center which is located across from
Phipps conservatory in Schenley
park.

Other active faculty members
and wives are: Dr. Edna Higbee,
secretary and lecturer in biology;
Mrs. Elmer Hutchisson; Mrs. Wil-
liam T. Root, Mrs. John J. Geise;
and A. F. DeWerth, horticultural
consultant for the bureau and lec-
turer at the University.

A number of University students
are also active in the work of the

precedent last

Wednesday evening when it tap-
ped to membership a non-student.

The newcomer’s contribution, a
sonnet, was read to the members
of the club. In open discussion a
member remarked: ‘_‘That, my
friends is technically perfect. I
don’t think, it is a Shakespearean.”

Customary to the club’s rules,
the poet’s name was withheld un-
til after the vote for his admis-
sion into the Club had been taken.
He was accepted without a dis-
senting vote.

Then the sonneteer’s name was
revealed. The club had tapped
one who is popularly known as
William (Will) Shakespeare, one-
time playwright of Stratford-on-
Avon.

On being interviewed, Mr.
Shakespeare’s only comment was
a quote from his eighty-third son-
net: “How far amodern quill doth

come too short.”

Pittiquette editor
applicatioiis due

Final date for applications for ed-
itorship of Pittiquette, a Pitt ver-
sion of “How to Win Friends and
Inﬂuence People" for freshman wo-
men, has been set as May 22.

Any woman in the University
who will submit an outline for the
book and a sample of her writing
style to the dean of Women’s office
by May 29 will be considered for
the position. The girl chosen editor
automatically becomes a member
of the WSGA social committee.

‘blitzkriegs’ sand flies

in front of the University’s Lake
Laboratory to ascertain effects of
weather on the numbers of the in-
sects, and shaved rabbits and
guinea pigs will. be used for feed-
mg the flies to determine their role
in the transmission of disease.
The main object of the study, Dr.
Williams explained, is to ﬁnd a
cheap, effective exterminator for
the eradication of the pests, He
plans to make an extended study
of repellents and attractions of
many chemical substances for the
ﬂies in an attempt to determine
ways of “discouraging” their activ-
ities and to lure them into exter-

minating chambers.

The University’s Erie Center, di-
rected by J. Lloyd Mahony, and the
Lake Laboratory at Presque Isle
will collaborate with Dr. Williams
in sponsoring the offensive. As spe-
cial envoy from Carnegie museum,
George E. Wallace, assistant cura-
tor of entomology, will work with
the University scientists on the
project.

Dr. Williams is a leading author-
ity on insects and this ﬁrst study
of beach ﬂies on a commercial
scale should bring to him and to the
University the unbounded gratitude
of thousands of ﬂy-bitten bathers.

hospitalization drive 

4' Sign;-now, pay
in September,  
says Carlson

By Lewis Riley

:“It’s the law of averages that

makes this ~ hospitalization busi-

ness 11-ecessary. You’re bound to
get caught sooner _.or later if you
don’t: sign. up. ” _
It‘ was Dr. H. Clifford Carlson
talking. C Surrounding him at the
ground floor “hospital booth” in the
Cathedral was a circle of question-
ing students. , ,
‘‘What’s more _ M
now is‘ sign, you don’t have to pay
anything until next September.
Then your protection will start and
you wi11‘be protected‘ during both

semesters’ and mid-year vacation,”

Dr. ‘Carlson assured ' his listeners.

The questions began to ﬂy thick

and fast:
No summer protection

“Am I protected this summer?
Can’t I have a private room? When
must I pay my’ money? How does
signing a card obligate me? i What
if I’m insured outside of the Uni-
versity?

Dr. Carlson was trying to keep
pace with his questioners:

“No, protection does not begin
until next September . Next
year protection will probably be ex-
tended throughout the summer
. . You don’t have to pay any
money until next September .
Your signing of this card does not
obligate you; you may back out in
the summer if you choose,” Dr.
Carlson rattled off the answers for
his questioners.

In spare moments the doctor told
an interviewer what the group in-
surance plan meant to him.
Beneﬁted» faculty ~ .  .

“The faculty—especially those
who have proﬁted by the plan al-
ready-—will have to sell it to the
students . .. They know its ben-
eﬁts because» they have experienced
them already; they can. give this
drive the aggressive touch that it
needs to put it over,” he said.

“Have the News tell students:
‘Don’t -procrastinate . . . you must
sign up now if we are going to put
this bupsiness over.”

Seniors are not eligible for the
hospitalization insurance this year;
however, students who sign up for
next year will be eligible for re-
duced insurance rates after gradu-
ation, Dr. Carlson explained.

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison gave her

for group hospitalization. insurance

“One of the greatest beneﬁts of
group hospitalization,” said Dr.
Jamison, “is that it would eliminate
completely the ‘Can I afford it?’
question that arises in the patient’s
mind immediately upon a doctors
recommendation that he be placed
in a hospital.”

“This worry caused by ﬁnancial

reasons has, in my experience, been ,,

Herewith is presented a portion of the first day’s
response to our call for opinions on “Our Relationship
to the European Conflict.” We intend to run the col-
umn in every issue for the rest of the year-—-in each
of the remaining three editions.

We reiterate our call for contributions from both
faculty and students.

Who is the bogey man?
observer wants to know

In his speech last Thursday, President Roosevelt
quoted statistics concerning the time by air from vari-

ous foreign—owned territories to points in America.
--The whole point, I suppose, was to show how quickly

we could be attacked if someone (guess who) wanted
to.

At the same time, he did not deﬁnitely show that
that someone had any deep-seated desire to add St.
Louis, Portland, or Kansas to his list of personal prop-

'erty. Maybe Europe doesn’t think that America’s des-

tiny is as irretrievably bound up with its destiny as

we think, that the Atlantic Ocean and the Paciﬁc no

longer serve as dividing lines. Maybe it does. I don’t
know.

I have no desire to see our nation in another war.
Nor do I want to join in the resigned feeling of inevi-
-tableness that so many of us seem to feel about Amer-
ica’s eventual participation in the war.

I am curious, though, to see what will be considered
a. threat to “our science, our culture, and our freedom.”

‘Full economic aid lnust be
rendered to the Allies’

Full. economic aid must be rendered to the Allies by
the United States in the present European conﬂict.
This country cannot stand by while the European na-
tions which most represent the ideals of democracy are
crushed by Adolf Hitler.and his armies. =

Some claim that the Allies are not democratic. A
word about democracy: Herr Hitler has this to say in
one of his works:

‘ “We must get rid of the last vestige of democracy,
especially of the methods of voting and making deci-
sions by majority.” ‘ =

‘ Our moral support is given to this program when
we fail to aid Hitler’s enemies by giving them’ vital
war. supplies. ‘ ‘

Of course, one ofthe basic issues of contention be-
tween interventionists and isolationists is whether our
interests would be better protected by an English vic-
tory, by a Nazi victory, or by neither. ,

, I believe that a victory for England is the only re-
sult which Americans should hope for. We know what
will happen if Germany wins: the last vestiges of de-
mocracy in Europe will be crushed, and Herr Hitler
will look across the Atlantic for new battleﬁelds and
new conquests.‘ This effort can be nipped in the bud
if theAA1lies win the war. .

I A word to those who think that the Atlantic Ocean
is big enough to defend us; the English said the same
thing about the English channel not so many years
ago.——W. L. K., C42.

Health aid plan
draws more praise

lalditor, The Pitt News:

Congratulations on having ac-
complished a purpose which I
thought was beyond even a student
publication. I refer to the organ-
ization of a student hospitalization
‘plan, which your newspaper is co-
isponsoring.

l When the plan was ﬁrst instituted
"here in the city, my father suggest-
-ed that I speak with a group of nine
«other students (ten is the smallest
‘number a hospitalization group
:may have) and petition for group
"insurance for myself and them. I
pooh-poohed the idea, knowing
boy apathetic college students have
always been about insurance, and
the future.

Consequently when. working for
a steel company this summer, I
a-vailed myself of the opportunity
to take out health insurance, hav-
ing continued paying my premiums
since that time.

I, therefore, cannot subscribe to

your sponsored plan. being a mem-

ber already; but I can sincerely rec-
ommend your group to those who
did not have an opportunity to be
enrolled through summer occu-
potion.
FRANK S. MILLER, C41.

Editor’s Note: May we point out,
Frank, that the rates of the student
frlan, offering identical services as
‘(he one 1/ou’7‘e under, are a little
lmuer and consequently more suit-
cd to a student’s purse.

Asserts Inquiry Forum
stands for democracy

Editor, the Pitt News:

Today Inq_uiry Forum gives the
student body an opportunity to dis-

cuss with the sponsors of the Stu-'

dent Hospitalization plan, the whys,
hows, and wherefores of the insur-
ances provided. Doc Carlson of the
Student Health Service and a rep-
resentative of the Hospital Serv-
ice association will present the pro-
posed Pitt service program.

It will give students a chance to
ask questions directly of the plan’s
proponents, and to settle any uncer-
tainties they might have about sub-
scribing. The Inquiry committee
feels that as a practical, construc-
tive program it deserves an open
hearing, and is cooperating with the
News and Health Services in pro-
viding that open hearing.

When the subjects of student
thought and inquiry here and
abroad are contrasted, we can real-
ize that probably in no other coun-

try are students being given the op-
portunities for discussion of, and
participation in, an organized serv-
ice program which utilizes scientiﬁc
and technological improvements for
a constructive social purpose.

In Germany, Russia, England,
ltaly——all over the world-—young
people of university age are com-
pelled to join streamlined motor-
ized forces, airplane bombing
squads, suicide parachute divisions,
units organized for wholesale mur-
der andthe smashing of civil secur-
ity. None of them have had a
chance to decide I voluntarily
whether they would be free agents
in a creative organization or agents
dedicated to a destructive endl

Inquiry Forum today illustrates
this contrast. The discussion itself
demonstrates the retention of the
free speech procedure in an attempt
to arrive at some understanding of
the subject. And the subject points

Editor, The Pitt News:

Would you please remind your
many readers that the University

It is very conveniently located at
the Fifth Avenue entrance of the
Cathedral, in the Information room.
Crammed into this room are many
books that careless students have

Comnlon Sense

Wherein we see that the pen
may or may not be mightier . .

By Gerald Ziskind
Friday, May 17, 1940.

   

My dear Signor Mussolini:

Against the will of your people, against the protests

of your church, against the welfare of your country,
against the wishes of your grand king—you, the buzzard
of. Europe, prepare to swoop down upon the civilization
of France and Britain and help the Blond Beast di-
gest the ﬂesh.

Signor Mussolini, you are a sane man. You are
educated. You are a writer, a thinker, a philoso-
pher. And! yet you join with a mad man, a bully, a
frustrated degenerate, to serve an immediate end of
enriching your country. For what advantage, I ask
you, is a number of torrid African colonies, if Rome
and Naples and Venice are but heaps of smouldering
ashes? What good is another Ethiopia, if your people
are maimed and slaughtered and broken?

‘You fear your own people . . . ~’

Signor Mussolini, you drive—-not 1ead—your peo-
ple with a whip into this folly. You force Italians to
embrace Hitler and the Berlin Axis when you know
that your Italian people have hated Germany through-
out history. You know that your people detest ﬁght-
ing; they were never and are not now a ﬁghting peo-
ple. You know that your people love culture and art
and music and sculpture, and you force them into the
hell of war to ﬁght for the ruin of civilization.

Yes, Signor Mussolini, you fear your own people.
You are afraid that they might read the truth so you
destroy all foreign newspapers. You force your people
to dislike your friends-—the peace-loving nations of
France and Britain—you compel them to join the Ger-

iman brigade of barbarism.

‘You fear . V. . a spokesman for decency’
Shame! Shame! Mussolini. With all your power
and airplanes and cannons you fear a humble servant
who lives near by you. He has no guns; he has no
dynamite. He is just a spokesman for decency. "He is
the leader of the Catholic church, Pope Pius XII. You
fear him Mussolini. For why do your agents rip to
shreds the little newspaper which he prints? ’ _
Signor Mussolini! You see Hitler’s legions suc-
cessful, so far, in his ghastly murder and you think

. the time is ripe to join him. But you are hasty.

Freedom-loving men can never be defeated. Britain
and France are in the vanguard, ﬁghting -against the
onrushing hords of barbarians, and history dictates
civilization’s victory as it hasalways done in the past.
You can not win, Mussolini. The humble man,
your Supreme Priest, the Vicar of Christ, whose be-
seeching prayers you muzzle, will be -the ultimate victor.
Meanwhile, Signor, I await your reply. If it be in
the form of unleashed bombs and terror: MAY GOD

HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL!

Respectfully,

’ GERALD ZISKIND.

Exam time brings forth survey
of college grading techniques

By Norma Lee Koelliker

With the approach of summer,
one of the nightmares of the aver-
age student makes its appearance.
Tuck Shops are not as full as they
were at the beginning of the se-
mester; libraries are ﬁlled to capac-
itl and for once college life takes on
a serious aspect. University students
are not alone in their dread of the
bugabear exams, for the students
all over the country are facing the
same problems.

Student surveys made on the sub-
ject of the fairness of ﬁnal exams
have proven that the majority of
collegians think that ﬁnal examina-
tions arelnot a fair test of a stu-
dent’s knowledge in a course.

We have long been of this opin-
ion, but what can be done about it?

O’Connell joins
Pharmacopoea“

Two members of the University
School of Pharmacy faculty. have
been named to_ committees of the
National Pharmacopoea for a ten-
year period. Dr. C. Leonard O’Con-
nell, dean of the school, has been
named chairman of the nominat-
ing committee and also a member
of the committee of revision.

The committee of revision will
serve for ten years to‘ revise the
standard prescription books for
pharmacists. of the United States.
Dr. George D. Beal, member of the
board, was’ also elected a member
of the committee of revision.

Others who attended the Pharma-
revision convention in
Washington last week were: Dr.
Louis Saalbach, professor of pharm-
acy; Dr. Edward C. Reif, professor
of materia medica; Dr. L. K. Dar-
baker, professor of bacteriology;
Dr. B. F. Daubert, assistant profes-
sor of pharmacy, and Robert R.
Gaw, member of the board of

Publications end year
with banquet May 29

The close of the -school year and
the end of the work of the "campus
publications will be marked’ by the
annual publications banquet at Ho-
tel Schenley on May 29.

Staff members of the Owl, News,
and Panther will attend this tradi-
tional affair. Former editors and
faculty guests have been invited.

The matter has been under discus-
sion at bull sessions and faculty
meetings alike, but nothing has
come of it.

University students are being
graded in the manner most popu-
larly approved of, according to the
survey made of the favorite grading
systems of students as a whole;
Some colleges simply approve or
disapprove a student’s work, (The
improve system referred to in
scholastic circles is not to be con-
fused here.) This plan is generally
unpopular, for 62 per cent of the
students prefer to be graded with
the ABC System. Thirty—six per-
cent are in favor of the Passed or
Failed System while the remaining
2 percent don’t know.

Gallant Panther squad snaps
Wolverine 23 meet win streak

By Ben Foote

Ferry ﬁeld, Ann Arbor, Michigan, May 18—The University of
Pittsburgh’s greatest track team toppled mighty Michigan from
the pinnacle of track and ﬁeld it had occupied East of the Rockies,
as the Panthers edged the Wolverines 67-64 here today.

Coach Ken Doherty’s thinclads suffered their ﬁrst dual, ti-1.
angular or quadrangular loss since May 18, 1936 as the Pitt team won

its fourteenth consecutive victory
and stopped a Michigan streak at 23
straight.

Hap Stickel, the sophomore won-
der boy, grabbed a major portion
of the individual glory as he won
three firsts. He romped home in
the 100 yard dash in 9.9, staged a
whirlwind ﬁnish to clip lVlichigan’s
Stan Kelley in the 220 yard low
hurdles in 23.5, and teamed with,
Frank Ohl to ﬁash a ‘runaway one-
two ﬁnish in the furlong in 21.7.

Reliable Ohl, the senior ﬂyer,
leaped 22 feet 111/2 inches to cop the
broad jump in addition to his sec-
ond notches in both the 100 and
220 and totaled , eleven markers.
Johnny Bazyk also scored a dou-
ble as he outdistanced Bob Ostroot,
Wolverine football tackle, in both
the shot put and discus throw. Ted
Konetsky backed Bazyk with a
show point in the latter.

Boulanger wins

At last rounding into the form
that gained him national recogni-
tion in 1939, Al Boulanger twice
burned up the track with sizzling
last quarter kicks to upset Ed Bar-
ret for ﬁrst in the mile in 4:24, and
third in the two mile. _

The sophomore vaulting stars,
Dusty Rhoades and. Red Jessup,

came through magniﬁcently to
count seven points in the ﬁnal
score. Rhoades climbed to 13 feet

six inches, barely missing the 14
foot mark in his try for a record,
and Jessup deadlocked Decker of

Michigan at 13 feet for second.

place.

Capturing the javelin throw,
sophomore Jim Elliott hurled the
spear 187 feet three inches and
Walt Fridley, junior gridder, toss-
ed 170 feet for a surprise second

 

ing up from ﬁfth with a thrilling
stretch drive to slip into second
behind Kelley in the 120 yard high
hurdle event. Del Anderson took
third in the 1153.8, 880 behind Dye
Hogan and Paul Kautz of Michigan.
Placing second Dave McDowell
leaped six feet three inches in the
high jump, won by Wolverine Don
Canham at 6 feet ﬁve and three
eighths inches.

Breidenbach stars

Outstanding from a national
standpoint was Warren Breiden-
bach’s dazzling 47.2 seconds quar-
ter, equalling his.own Ferry ﬁeld
and Michigan record. Teammate
Jack Leutritz was right behind in
47.4 and Al Ferrara followed in
third place in 48 seconds ﬂat, the
best time of his career.

After the meet had been decid-
ed, the Wolverines grabbed some
belated glory as they got credit
for the mile relay. The Pitt anchor
man, Ohl, had withstood Breiden-
bach’s challenge clear down, the
home stretch, and‘ crossed the finish
line a good two feet ahead of the
Wolverine star, but the judges got
their.heads together and decided to
disqualify Pitt with the charge
that Ohl cut in front of Breiden-
bach.

46.6 anchor

Whether Ohl fouled the Michigan‘
star is problematical for Breiden-
bach was clocked in- 46.6 for his
anchor leg, and that he could have
run any faster today seems out of
the realm of possibility. Ferrara,
Larry Tregoning, and Bud Graf
handed ﬁrst place to Ohl, and the
Pitt time was 3:153, the second
fastest mile relay ever run by a

Newmans engage Oil & Gus nine;

S/[Ms top Pi Lums for I-F title

By Alex Zelenski

Newman Club, undefeated in-
dependent mushball champions,
will meet the Oil & Gas nine, ti-
tle-holders in the engineering
league, in the ﬁrst round of in-
tramural playoﬁs tomorrow at 5
o’clock.

The Newmans have won ﬁve
games thus far this season, out-
standing of which was their vic-
tory over last year’s champs, Gam-
ma Gamma Woos. Oil & Gas also
has an undefeated record but has
played only three games.

Mel Port and Ersil Castello hurl
for the independent winners, while
Mike Sekela usually takes the hill
for the Gassers. Port is the most
outstanding man on either team;
his no hit victory at the start of the
season branded him one of the top
pitchers in intramural competition.
Hitting Predomlnates

Hitting has been predominant in
each team’s victories. Charley Pta-
cek, Jimmy: Brown, Sam Milano-
vitch, and Bob Johnson have all
proved to be power-houses at the
plate. An example of their prowess
at bat was shown in their ﬁnal
game. The Amity Club watched
the ball fly by as Ptacek and Dunn
hit homers to help make the score,
20-6. ‘

For the engineers Bielek and Sek-
ela have provided ‘the main punch.
They have scored at least 10 runs
every time out, once reaching the
twenty mark. V

The surviving team will then play
Sigma Alpha Mu, fraternity cham-
pions, later this week.

Lou Mendlow did it again. For
the second consecutive year Sigma
Alpha Mu won the fraternity cham-
pionship, led by the stout heart_and
arm of star pitcher Mendlow.

Pi Lams beaten, 12-0

The largest crowd of the season
was on hand for the championship
encounter, which matched the fra-
ternities’ two best pitchers, Pi Lam
Bert Jaﬂe and Sammie’s Mendlow.

They were not disappointed as“? --*

Carnage reigns as ‘nine old men’
from faculty lose to vaisityteums

By Sheme Bazell

A nine act comedy entitled “How
not to play baseball,” or “Can we
help it if we’re from Pittsburgh?”
was presented last Tuesday by a

group of faculty members who had.‘

organized ‘a baseball team. Using
the varsity diamond squad as
straight men, the faculty demon-
strated clearly why teaching and
not baseball is their chosen pro-
fession.

Nick Kliskey undertook the pitch-
ing duties for the teachers, with
Bob Hoel acting as backstop. Klis-
key got off to a jittery start as the
varsity collected ﬁve straight safe-
ties to short stop, when not one of
-Paul Zehfuss’ throws reached ﬁrst
base. Dr. Zehfuss, by the,way, was

placed at the short stop position as .~

a “defense” measure.

Bill Daddio, playing ﬁrst base,
generously took it upon himself to
sustain all injuries thatimight befall
any member of his team. Physical
inventory at the end of the contest
disclosed that Daddio, among other
things, had stoved a thumb, bumped
his head, and battered his shins.

Gene Myers, Ben Williams, Steve
Horton, and Jim Potts divided the
task of chasing outﬁeld ﬂies. But
they seemed to have commonly

We may be cynical but we have been unimpressed
by the fuss made in recent months over Don Herring
and Monte Strattton and Eddie Collins, Jr. Each has
lost a leg in some kind of accident, and each has
promised to try to carry on in athletics in spite of the
handicap.

Herring, a Princeton tackle, had his leg crushed in a
football scrimmage 1as.t fall. This spring he is attempt-
ing to earn a varsity letter as a shot putter on the
Tiger track squad. We commend him for it.

Stratton and Collins both are seeking a comeback in
baseball, Collins as a catcher and Stratton as pitcher
and coach for the Chicago Whitesox. We commend both
of them.

The three have been cited for their outstanding ex-
amples of courage and bravery in sports, and we pick
no quarrel with those who so praise them. But we do
object to their being set aside as persons to be par-
ticularly lauded.

While no one would deny that the loss of a limb is a
tremendous handicap and one which may wreck a man’s
future life, the list of those who have surmounted such
a loss without benefit of public fanfare is long.

We know a doctor, a ﬁne surgeon. A victim of blood
poisoning, he was compelled to have a leg amputated.
Today he wears an artiﬁcial leg and gets around almost
as well as before. More important, he has turned to leg
injuries as a specialty and is making noteworthy prog-
ress in the ﬁeld.

We know several other men who were injured when
only boys and who now are walking with the aid of
artiﬁcial legs. Furthermore, they have gone ahead on
their jobs. They haven’t complained, they haven’t asked
for pity or special privileges, and in most cases their
disability is known to only a few of the people with
whom they work.

1 .This is beginning to sound like a Pollyanna story,
which it is not meant to be; but what we are trying to
get at is that while physical handicaps are deserving
of intelligent consideration, they should not be paraded
before the eyes of the public by mawkish, sentimental
exhibitionists.

Particularly is this true at the present time. In
Europe and the Far East, men are being mangled and
torn apart every day. Casualties are on such a mass
scale that we are incapable of grasping their portent.
We, as a nation, “view with alarm” but we treat the
whole situation lethargically.

If we could look ahead and see, not a handful of
cripples, but hundreds of factory workers and mill
laborers and ofﬁce clerks and salesmen with hands or
legs or arms or parts of faces missing, we might find
our attitude toward three athletes a little superﬁcial.

Herring, Stratton, Collins—-they wouldn’t quit. But
sports bulk small in the world’s affairs, and there are
many who have refused to quit. There will be many
more when Europe stops ﬁghting. This is

Dr. Jamison

Continued from page one
od to speedily hospitalize the pa-
tient. ,

Returning with the records, Dr.
Jamison continued, “This year
alone, my files show that there have
been three cases in which hospitali-
zation was delayed for various rea-
sons, resulting in a more serious ill—-
ness, and an additional cost of from
$150 to $200 per patient.”

“Two -or three years ago, the lack

_ of hospitalization insurance proved

almost fatal to a University student,
when, stricken with pneumonia, she
had to be taken home in an auto-
mobile, because, for ﬁnancial rea-
sons, she could not enter a Pitts-
burgh hospital.

“A more pleasant counterpart is
seen in the case of one girl, who,
because of her family having hospi-
talization, was operated on for ap-
pendicitis speedily enough to not
only save her life, but greatly in-
crease the speed of her recovery.” 9

niversity Library fimls solution
to book request slip problerns

For those who didn’t know, for
those who knew, and for those who
wish to rejoice, the_University Li-
brary has experimented with new
“book request slips” and has found
the answer to the perfect student's
prayer, and a real reliefto the li-
'orarian’s despair.

Efﬁciency plus characterizes the
new slips. They will give you de-
tailed “info” as to why your book
has not made its appearance. Fur-
thermore, those of you who have
never caught onto the hang of using
a “book request slip” will ﬁnd de-
tailed information as to their prop-
er use printed clearly on the back.
This last addition promises to erase
the}, blank expression on the faces
of students seeking literature. '

Now at last the fog and pmystery
that surrounded “book request
slips” has lifted and will begin to
disappear in the Summer Session,
