the annualdebate against the~U-niversity-*C~ollege of the -West-

commented

Woody Turner, Arts, Sr., “The Jamaicans use the British sys-

tem of debating, and it was an in—$

teresting experience to
with this style.

Woody Turner and Leonard
Buckey accompanied by Dr. Mary
Roberts, director of the Univers-
ity’s debating union, were the
guests of the UCWI during their
stay in Jamaica. They ‘ visited
sugar and banana plantations,
learning about Jamaican life and

deb_ate

‘ customs.

“What was particularly inter-
esting about our trip was the con-
tact we had with Jamaican ‘stu-
dents and the opportunity to talk
with them about their affairs and
ours.” Dr. Roberts stated.

Students eagerly look forward
to this trip to Jamaica each year.
Only seniors are selected for it
because of its great responsibility.
“These students are actually rep-
resenting the United States people
to the Jamaicans,” said Dr. Rob-
erts. “Their maturity and good

‘sense count a great deal.”

Poetryﬂiscussion Me roha

Lee, Betts, Hazo
Study Two,Poems
Of Rare Complex

SUSANNA DOWNIE
A panel, composed of Law-
rence Lee, professor of Eng-
lish, Dr. William Betts, Eng-

-lish professorat Indiana State
" Teachers

College, and Dr.
Samuel Hazo,’Eng1ish pro-
fessor at Duquesne University, dis-
cussed, explicated and otherwise
worried “two warts on the body of
English poetry.”

The discussion was held at the

second meeting of the Graduate

Humanities Club’ last Thursday.

William Starbuck’s “On First
Looking in on Blodget’s Keat’s,
and Chapmen’s Homer” and an
anonymous poem, “Fall Meeting”
were chosen for their divergent
use of the same central imagery-~
the queen bee —- drone -— honey
complex.

MELLOW VIRGINIAN
‘Lee, in mello\r/ ‘Virginian ac-

cents, started the program with

the not-so-mellow criticism that
the poems were ﬂabby, lirhpid,
rather. dreadful and not deserving
of the name “poetry.” ’

Dr. Betts and Dr. Hazo fur-
ther commented on the meaning
and imagery of the poems and
the whole panel seemed to agree
that. both were clever, satirical
and not the best poetry ever
written.

The discreet, intellectual broo-
haha which followed the prelimi-
nary comments was highly enter-
taining, if not enlightening. Lee,
having a “profound intolerance”
for modern pseudo—Eliot poets,
immediately took the position that
we are living in the Leaden Age of
Poetry, rather than the Golden; a
talent-laden one, Suggested Dr.

Hazo, and furthermore, that only
good poems are real poems.
A TITTER-MUTTER
A titter-mutter of amusement
and protest rufﬂed around the
room and the Hazo—Betts team,
dazed but game, proceeded to de-

fend the rights of bad poets to ex-

ist and mediocre poets to write po-
etry.

As Dr. G. K. Gibson, professor
of poetry at New York Univer-
sity, visitor here, said later, “It
was nice to see an issue so thor-
oughly joined.”

The “joyful miasma” (Lee’s de-
lightful description of it) ended
the pan-panel agreement that you

s can sometimes judge ._a poem by its

punctuation but the good poets are
not always the dead poets.

Sociology Department to Begin
New Graduate Program in Fall

The Department of Sociology will put into eﬁect ‘next

‘ fall a new graduate program. One feature of this program is
A the emphasis upon direct training of graduate students for

the responsibilities they will be called upon to assume as

professional sociologists.

While other components of the graduate program will

give‘ the students an opportunity.

to teach and engage in research,
the students themselves will be
responsible for initiating ‘and
maintaining their own profession-
al contacts.

Also, they will be expected to
seek and arrange opportunities to
present their own papers. to the
scientiﬁc community. ’ —

To compliment the lectures
and seminars offered by the de-
partment, the students will in-
vite speakers from other insti-
tutions to present pa.pers in the
department and to discuss their
work with them.

To implement this, a committee
of graduate students under the
direction of Richard Jung .was
formed in the fall of 1960 to as-
sume responsibility for the organ-
ization of a Graduate Sociology
Colloquium. ‘

Approximately an equal number
of graduate students in the Soci-
ology Department, instructors
within the University, and social
psychologists from other institu-
tions will be invited to address
the Colloquium.

Valuable Picasso WOPIC. Stolen 

F rom  Student Union Art Show

A valuable original pain

ting by famed artist Pablo

Picasso has been discovered missing from the Student Union
Lounge where it had been on display for the past ﬁve months,

The university reported the theft yesterday to Pittsburgh
police after the painting was found missing by Richard
Dodds, a graduate student and dormitory counselor. Detec-

 

tives immediately launched
investigation into the mysterious
theft.

The abstract painting, entitled
“19l8,”, was hanging on a wall
in the Union. William J. Gil-
more, assistant superintendent
of detectives, said the wires
holding the painting had either
been cut or pulled from the
wall.

The wires were turned over to
the crime laboratory for analysis.

The Picasso original, 11 by 14
inches, was on loan to the uni-
versity from the Guggenheim
Foundation of New York City
along with several other valu-
able pieces of art.

In New York, Guggenheim
officials said their records show
the painting had been loaned
to Pitt last .Aug. 15 and was
due to be returned to the
foundation shortly. They said
they purchased the oil in 1937.
It is insured. ‘_

The value of the work was not
learned immediately, but Dr. Wal-
ter Hovey, head of the Fine Arts
Department, said its value could.
be about $10,000. He said some
of Picasso’s originals are worth
as much as $40,000.

Gives Viewpoints on State, Local

Politics in Political Scence Talk
By JIM HUFNAGEL
What kind of mechanisms are state and local govern-
ments? What will be the biggest problem facing urban re-

newal? What is the value of ‘red tape’?

These questions were asked and answered by. Frank
Bane, Chairman of the U. S. Advisory,Commission on Inter-
_.governmental Relations, during a discussion-entitled “The

Role of Politicians, Managers, and?

Technicians in our Cities.”
Speaking on state and local
governments, Bane who has been
in politics for -45 years, said that
“85 per cent of the activities of
the executive branch of any gov-
ernment are, spent in collective
housekeepipg~—that is, the expen-
diture of money originally, spent
by the individual. . .
Cities Example
“Welfare is a particularly good
example of this. Sixty years ago
nobody cared about what happen-
ed to somebody else’s grandfather.
""_1‘he biggest problem to come
in urban renewal,” Bane con-
tinued, “will be the growth and
spread of suburbia.”. -
“Within the next decade we
may have one solid metropolitan
area stretching from New, York

through Philadelphia and Balti-

more to Washington, D. C.

Field Increases
“Because of this rapid spread,
City Management is becoming an
ever-increasing ﬁeld, particularly
for those who would like to work

‘as assistants to mayors.”

When asked’ about the incon-
veniences of .“red tape”, Bane
replied “There are two princi-
”pal reasons for red tape in a
large organization to let‘ the
right hand know what the left
is doing, and to keep people

T from stealing.‘

“When dealing with red tape it

"is helpful to remember the advice

of an ‘old politician, ‘you never
give anything away,‘ you always
trade.’ Recent college gr-adauates
should not ﬁxate against red tape
too quickly, however because to
do so automatically eliminates
working for a large company.”

Compares to Cake

Commenting on the change»
which has occurred in federal-
state-local relationships, Bane

‘ compared the structure to a cake,
~ Saying, “the governmental struc-

ture used to be like a layer cake,
with local government as the ﬁrst
layer, state as the second, and fed-
eral as the third, all iced over by
the constitution.
Now the divisions have be-
come blurred and we have a

sort of marble cake with every- ,,

t h in g intermixed. Interstate

» compacts have taken the ‘place

of states in maintaining the fed-
eral system.” V
The purpose of the panel dis-
cussion sponsoredby the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, was to inform students
about the opportunities available
to them in city government.

These are only a few of the .
group’s possible activities. . They
will be able to do anything from
directing emergency rescue op-
erations to playing‘ chess over

To. put, student government back on its ‘feet, is the

An added impetus for the rejuvenating of the student
government is the heavy competition for the senatorial po-

sitions and vice—president.

. This great increase in the number of students who wish
to participate and inﬂuence the policy formation at the

We hope that all students who feel that they can con-

We are not saying that the students already running are
not qualiﬁed, but that this is the best way to create a wide

for an oﬁice must hand in his petition by Wednesday.

This coming election, and the participation that it pro-

over-

come the traditional thinking and procedures of past stu-
dent governments, and are going to develop adequate rela-

nity.

Nietzsche ‘vs. Peale. . .

By Ina Amdur
One of the main characteristics of our American
‘culture is its fearful and frenzied ﬂight from the
‘ Our most honored espouser of this ﬂight
Positive thinking, so he
It is a strange

negative.
is Norman Vincent Peale-

characteristic of _cultural ad-
vancement, however, that the
great improvers of culture have
been negative thinkers insofar as
they have negated in all or some
respects the tradition which was
handed down to them. This is
equally true of artistic, philo-
sophic, religious and social re-
formers. They have all taken
the accepted tradition and modi-
tied it. All modiﬁcation is in
some way saying no.
Admittedly the negative is only one half of the
picture,’ but it is the ﬁrst half and must preceed
the affirmative. The culture that aﬂirms before it

negates hassbuilt its aﬂirmation on clay and that

is what we have done in America. Nietzsche was
a positive thinker insofar as he said yes joyfully.
But the difference between Nietzsche and Norman
_Vincent Peale is this: Nietzsche’s yes to life was
pronounced with an abnormally sensitive percep-
tion of the negative elements in human existence.
Peale’s yes to life is pronounced with an abnor-
mally insensitive perception of the positive and no
perception of true negativity.

Flight From Time ‘ O.

The ‘examples in our culturelof this ﬂight from.

the negative are most evident in our ﬂight from
time. Time is the grand negator of everything hu-
man. So women dye their hair, lift their faces,
and in general manage to assume mask-like visages
by the time they are thirty. They forget that grow-
ing old is not a new occurrence and that the victory
of time is inevitable from the beginning”.

Another obvious manifestation of our ﬂight from

  

Flight from‘ the

 

 

time is our ﬂight from death. People don’t die,
they “pass away” on clouds of euphemisms. When
they do “pass away,” they are laid to rest with the

  
     

Negative 

other’ “loved ones.” ‘Before they a.e laid to rest, *_

they are made up to look as if they ivere still alive,
After all, if dead people looked like they were dead,
they might frighten the living into thinkingpthat
they were going to die too. This way, no one’s the
wiser.

 

A corollary of our attitude toward the dead is \;

our attitude toward anything morbid. We don’t
want to hear, read, or see anything which reminds
us of the negative. Every book jacket as one satir-
ical critic pointed out, must insure the reader that
‘beneath that book lies a passionate afﬁrmation.”

Witnqss to Nothing

Hollywood is the best witness to our lack of the a

negative in American ﬁlms and television can claim
equalstatus. ,Neither of these media show us the
possibilities of experience nor do they perfect our
power to perceive. They have practically no rela.
tion to that which we do experience and with which
we must come to terms. The tenuous victory of

, the good guy over the bad guy, of the just over the

injust, stands in direct contradiction to that which
we can all see. .. We all recognize, even with our
cultural blinderson, that good men suffer evil and
to their suffering there is no meaning and for their
suffering there is no reason. '

If our entertainment does not provide us with
the desired oblivion, medicine does. ' We do not

I

give the people light and hope that they will find.

their way; we give -the people tranquilizers and find
thetway for them. i

One could continue this analysis of the avoid-
ance of the negative in American culture to show
thatpthere is no aspect in which the negative is not
camaﬂouged. We live happily on top of a false
foundation which is always in danger of cracking.
It is \part of our dignityas sentient creatures, that
is, asfeeling creatures,,to be cognizant of the ‘nega-
tive and to negate when necessary.

Engineer Blasts
New Registration

Editor, The Pitt News:

Congratulations Pitt !! You
were in rare form in displaying
your true colors during the past
registration period. It must have
taken special talent to scramble
so many schedules, lose so many
of last trimester’s grades, charge

so many wrong amounts to bills,

and generally confuse and ex-
asperate so many already con-
fused and exasperated students.

A prominent pictureon page
5 of the January 9th issue of
The Pitt News ran with it, a
caption, which read in part --

A “From all reports, what little

problems that did arise were
handled quickly and smoothly.”
Ask and student who has spent
the greater parts of two or three
days jostling to get through the
doors of the Office of Student
Records.

They’ll tell you, among other
things, that there are four chip-
ped tiles on the floor, a sharp-
edged desk next to the right
wall, and various other interest-
ing bits of useful knowledge they
acquired while waiting to change
Saturday and evening classes to
less atrocious hours. Beleve me,
the wait is no fun.

The only solution I can forsee
is that of purchasing four new
IBM machines to check on the

ones now handling our registra- ‘

tion. Also helpful, would be a
‘free taxi service to transport
around Oakland, students chas-
ing signatures which allow them
to present $500 to the University.

I can take the trimester plan,
the University police parking
tickets, the long “bread line’’
to the cafeteria. But somehow,
I become a trifle chagrinned at
all the red tape one must trans-
gress to get a few classes ‘be-
tween 8 andvﬁve. Particularly

-annoying is , the University’s
seeming apprehension to accept
my payment for the next tri-
mester. (But just let someone
not pay, and the administration
would send a fleet of Lark-driv-
ing University police to suponea
him.) \

Here’s hoping the system will
improve». If it doesn’t, some hap-
less rezvenger is going to feed
the “7070” a bucket of bolts to
gag its “flawless” operation.

Graduate Disagrees

With Turner Letter

Editor, The Pitt Nesw:

It was most appropriate that
the article in last Monday’s Pitt
News, on what 'a university

might be like in 1984, was on"

the same pageras a letter from
Woody Turner in which he in-
forms us that he would relegate
to our state legislature some of
the powers of a Thought Police.

In the letter he implies that
anyone capable of “sound rea-
soning” could not possibly join
any organization whose position
on ‘basic foreign policy issues

udiﬁers from that of those who

currently administer the affairs
of the United States Govern-
ment. Indeed, anyone who does

join or support the policies of

such organizations is undoubtedly
“a dupe” or “a subversive” and
must be serving .“the interests of
the international communist con-
spiracy.”

I’ve been taught that in a

democratic society one has the“

right to espouse views which are
in opposition to those of the gov-
ernment without fear of intimi-
dation; that it is even our duty to
express our disagreements with
the government when we have
them. The new President of the
United States was elected on the‘
basis of statements made during

V icy

the campaign in which he ex-

pressed disagreement with th 65"

then current administration on
basic domestic and foreign pol-
issues. Would Mr. Turner
suggest that.APresident Kennedy
is a political dupe-?

I fear that it is Woody Turn-
er, himself, who is the unwitting
dupe of those who would subvert
our basic democratic rights.

the right to free speech does not

Born in Paris in 1927, Jean
Casadesuz; studied first with his
great—aunt, Rose Casadesus, and
later worked at the Paris Con-
servatory and with his father.

He moved to the U. S. withhis
family in 1940, and his profession-

when he made his debut as solo-

March, 1947, after winning the

Contest.‘

That fall he also won the First
Medal at the Geneva International
Competition.

Begins Career

In 1948 he began a professional

career which since then has in-

\cluded successful engagements in

recital and with orchestras in
Holland, Switzerland, France and

’ Italy.

In six successive tours of the
United States and Canada, he
appeared with all of the princi-

In 1955 Casadesus made his first
tour of the Central American
countries, followed by a -tour of
South America. Occasionally he
appears with his eminent parents

Hoopers Must Improve°
Shooting Timmons Says

BULLETIN

The heavy snow storm that hit' the eastern United
States during the weekend has forced tonight’s Pitt-Boston
College game at Boston to be canceled. Panther Coach Bob
Timmons said late yesterday he was "unable to make, trav-
eling arrangements for.the team. Timmons said the two
teams also were unable to come up with another date for

ancels Tilt at Boston College

the game so it will not be played this season.

‘ B)’ JIM 0’BRIEN
The hungry Panthers have had ﬁve days to droll over
their sweet victory over Bucknell,l79—67, and they have en-
joyedthe taste. Tonight they are away from their friendly

Field House, which has jinxed

the best of visiting stars, and

will vie for their tenth win at Boston College.

Don Martin’s Eagles have

been sharpening their. claws

for the battle, having battled with:
Army over the weekend. They
should still be smarting from the
69-65 setback which underdog
Yale handed them on Wednesday
night.

Last season the Cats split even 
with a 1-1 I chart against their V’
hosts. They won 76-66 .at the 

 

Field House, but suffered a 75-66  ‘

loss in the Queen City Tourna-

ment in Buffalo. Having lost only 
one starter from last year’s ag- . .' ..
gregation which posted an 11-4 ~

record, the Eagles should be a 

formidable opponent.

Despite the Eagles 8-5 mark
beﬁore the Army game, Timmons
feels that his crew will‘ be in the
thick of things. “Just as I’ve said
all year,” he remarked, “If we’re

hitting, we’ll be alright. If we’re 

not, well . . .” .-
His exclusion of a ﬁnal thought
,doesn’t require much mental
work to draw an inevitable con-
clusion.

“Against zone teams we have
been doing real well,” he added.
“We shot 45% against Bucknell
and we won. But when you play
away anything is possible.” ,

Two stars for Skyscraper U. in
last year’s meetings were Bob
Sankey and Paul Lazor. Sankey
scored 14 points in the win, and

WVU Next on Gym Schedule;
Georgia Tech Fray Canceled

Weather permitting, the Panther I
gymnasts are hoping to gain their
first victory of the 1961 campaign
when they invade Morgantown
Wednesday evening for an en-
counter with Coach Bill Bonsa1l’s
Mountaineers. The Jungle Ca_ts
won last year’s meet at home 63-
33 and ﬁgure to win easily again.

If the Blue and Gold gymnasts,
coached by Warren Neiger are
successful against the Mountain-
eers, it would give the Panthers
a record of 1-2. The Jungle Cats
dropped their ﬁrst two contests
of the season to Navy and Army.

The Panthers had ﬁgured to
win their first meet of the gym
wars against Georgia Tech in At-
lanta, Georgia, last Saturday but
the Pittsburgh Weatherman failed
to cooperate.

“We were all set to leave for
Georgia Tech last Friday but

then that darn snow hit us and
we just were not able to get av
plane out of Pittsburgh,” re
plied a disappointed Neiger after
having to cancel the meet with
the Yellow Jackets.

All members of the Blue and
Gold gym team were even more
dejected about the postponement
than Neiger. “Just when we get
an easy opponent for a phange
and ﬁgure to win, something like
this has to happen,” declared
gymnast Ron Daugherty.

Coach Neiger plans no lineup
changes for the clash with West
Virginia. Included in the eight-
man traveling squad are .co-cap-
tains Joe Battaglia and Jack Rai-
naldi, Daugherty, John Lehner,
Earl McConnell," Ed Zamecnik,
Bob Pingatore and John Patter-
son.

Double Victories In
Lopsided Dual Meet
By JOHN FLEMMING
While the rest of New York
was paralyzed with a 17 inch
snow, the Panther Mermen
trudged through the storm to
the campus of NYU to score a

lopsided 68-27 victory.

Carl .Warnes and Bart Haas
scored double victories for the
Aquatic Cats while trouncing the

tankers from NYU. The entire

team proved that the weather has
no eﬁect on their abilities.

Warnes, however, was not satis-
ﬁed with only the double victory
as he set a new school record in
the 200 yard breaststroke. Warnes
was clocked at 2234.1 bettering the
old record set by Ed Robson by
m.ore than seven seconds.

Captures First Place

Warnes also captured first place
in the 200 yard individual medley.
Commenting on Warnes’ showing,
Coach Grady said, “Carl has been
swimming well all year, but he
has .met some exceptionally good
swimmers in his events.”

Both of Haas’ victories were

Maimen Having
Troubles; Worst
Yet to Come~

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

IIVIIIIIIPIIRIIIIII!l'rIlIllll7FV|

 

At the start of the wrestling season the Panther matmen appeared.

to be one of the strongest teams in the nation, and yet with two of
their toughest matches remaining, the grapplers sport a mediocre 4-2
record.

What has brought about this complete change in form for the
team that for the last ten years has never lost more than two matches
in a single season?

I On paper the matmen appeared unbeatable. They went into the
season with four wrestlers who had never lost a dual match. They
had an outstanding prospect coming up from the freshman team.

Jim Harrison was the sophomore who was expected to jump
right into’ a starting berth. He was unbeaten as a frosh grappler
and had an outstanding high school record. Although Harrison
is a regular 15'!’ pounder he has been wrestling at 167 and 177
pounds and now has a 5-1 record. He has been doing his part.

To round out the team at the beginning of the year Coach Rex
Peery had Bob Guzik, an outstanding heavyweight who ﬁnished third
» in the Easterns last year, Brooks Compliment, a better than average
177-pounder, and Dave Weitzel, who would have ﬁlled in nicely at the

_ l17—pound berth.
With Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington, John Zoli-
koff, Harrison, Weitzel, Compliment, August Arrigone and Guzik in

_ the starting line-up, the Panthers would have been almost unbeatable.

But Peery ran into trouble. Compliment and VWeitzel were
lost because of ineligibility.‘ This forced Peery to shift his grap-
plers around in order to attempt to win an extra match.

Kelvington moved up to 157 and got beaten. .Harrison_ went up
to 177 and ‘got beaten. Lauchle and Zolikoff were both upset and
Guzik met some tough competition and lost a couple matches- ,.,Chu“ck
Shaﬁenhas been wrestling in the 191-pound division and has yet to
emerge victorious. ‘ , ‘

Arrigone wrestled in higher weight classes and has been losing.
As a result the Panthers are having a poor year.

With Maryland, Lehigh and Penn State coming up the road

, is going to get rougher instead of better. Maryland can be beaten
but Lehigh may have the best team in the country and Penn State
is always tuogh.

What Peery may decide to do is move Kelvington back down to
137 and Harrison to 157. This will give the Cats a good chance to win
the first ﬁve divisions but Peery will have to hold his ‘breath in the
other four classes.

A look at the future shows the Panthers still have an excellent
chance in the Easterns. Zolikoff will be defending his 147 pound
championship and Martin, Lauchle and Kelvington were runners-up
last year. -

Harrison and Guzik may be able to place and with six men
placing in the Easterns the Panthers have an excellent chance of
capturing the team title.

As far as the rest of the season goes there is still a chance of up-
setting Lehigh and State. With victories over these two clubs a poor
season could turn into a great one.

Harrison Defeats
Wohlfert on Pin;
Lightweights Win

If the Michigan State wres-
lers have a strong dislike for
their counterparts in Pitts-
burgh, it is doubtful that any-
one could blame them.

the Spartans have lost only twice
and both defeats have come at
the hands of the Panthers. On
Saturday the Blue and Gold
trounced the Spartans 19-8 at the
Field House.

The Cats reeled off four straight
wins before the Spartan could
gain a triumph. State’s taste of
victory was short lived, however.
In the 167-pound match Jim
Harrison pinned Duane Wohlfert
and clinched the meet for the
Panthers. Harrison achieved the
pin with a bar arm and body
press.

In a thrilling match, Larry
Lauchle was victorious over high-
ly touted Jerry Hoke. The match
was even with less than two min-
utes remaining when Lauchle
scored a clutch take down to in-
sure his 4-2 victory.

Dick Martin got. the Panthers
off on the‘ winning track in the
123-pound class. Martin decision-
ed the previously unbeaten Okla
Johnson, 7-3. Johnson, who usual-
ly wrestles at 115 pounds, was
substituting for highly regarded
George Hobbs, wh.o was ill.

Had Hobbs wrestled it is doubt-
ful that the outcome would have
been different since Martin easily
beat him last year.

Daryl Kelvington proved to ev-
eryone that his best weight is 137
pounds. Kelvington easily b ca t
former Big 10 -champion, Norm
Young, 6-2.

John Zolikoff, who suffered
the first dual meet _loss of his col-
legiate career, last week, got back
on the winning track at the hands
of the Spartans. Zolikoff had an

In Section “B” the division is

“The service schools have en-
. ough material to place fresh men

A bright spot in the track pic-
ture, however, is the overall im-
provement of the team. Several
trackmen are turning in better
performances than at any time in
the past.

Dan Kanell, according to Rees,

, has a good chance of breaking the
school shot-put record this win-
ter. Both Harry Stokes and Vance

Carter are expected to pick up_

wins at Harvard. Ron Weirs has
also been cited by Rees as a pro-
mising pole vaulter.
