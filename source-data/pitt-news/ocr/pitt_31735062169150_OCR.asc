Dr. Crouch Reports
Trimester System May
Come Under Review

The present University trimester system is under re-
view and this will probably be one of Chancellor Wesley W.

Posvar’s first concerns.

This information was received from Dr. George W.
Crouch, secretary of the University. “We are concerned
about the trimester,” said Dr. Crouch, “and we want to
provide a system that the students. want.” . .

“Although a student poll in November of 1966 indicated -that
students favor the trimester. we are going to see how many like
it enough to attend the spring term,” said Dr. Couch. “Many stu-

dents who formerly attended the spring trimester might only at- -

tend the ﬁrst session this year. For this reason, we might {have

Four Pitt students have won
recognition in a nationwide writ-

lantic magazine, the contest an-
nually attracts hundreds of en-
tries in the categories of story,
poetry, and essay.

The students are: Judith S.

Zapf, and Ben Feiller. Miss Il-
son received honorable mention
for her poem “Still Life.” Mr.
DeCcsare was granted a merit
award for an essaycntitled “My

able mention in the essay cate-
gory. Ben Feiler was given a
merit award for his poem, “The

Among the alternatives which
Dr. Crouch mentioned were a
lengthened semester, a quarter
system, and a .ten-week system.
“One alternative would be to

‘ add one to three weeks on to

our trimesters,” said Dr. Crouch.
(‘This way, there wouldibe only
two semesters.

“Another alternative is a quar-

lter system. This would be simi-

lar to our experiment this spring
with seven week sessions.
“The third alternative is a
10-week session, similar to that
which is used by Penn State.»
‘‘All- of these will very likely
come under the review of Chan-
cellor Posvar,” said Dr. Crouch.
Along with his comments on
the trimester, Dr. Crouch made
announcements about the cal-
endar for next year. “Basically,
we want to provide the student
with more time between trimes-
ters. For example, the Winter
trimester will not begin until
Jan. 8.” '
Dr. Crouch also" announced
that exams will be handled dif-
ferently next year. The exami-
nation period will last ten days,
rather than a week, and read-
ing days will be mixed with
exam days. "

Chancellor Addresses Final

Remarks At Commencement.

Presiding over his second and

"final Commencement at the Uni-

versity, Chancellor David Kurtz-

Wednesday not to replace the
stereotypes of their parents’ gen-
eration with stereotypes of their

own making “that are more
fashionable, perhaps, but not
necessarily more accurate.”

urged the graduates to “keep
faith with the democratic sys-
tern.”

Earlier, the graduates had
heard a message from Presi-
dent Lyndon B_. Johnson, which
was read at the start of com-
mencement ,cer.em«o.n_ies. The
President said,‘ I .;?fYbu=r' i 5ge‘ne_ra- .

you is the challenge to make
this lifelong commitment.”

One-hundred and sixty-one in-
dividuals received doctoral de-
grees at the ceremonies on. the
Cathedral lawn, while 32 candi-
dates for-‘degrees in course grad-
uated with departmental hon-
ors. -

The emphasis of Dr. Kurtz-
man’s'-speech was on “. . . what
‘I have learned from you (the
gradua-tes).” Referring to his
childhood escape from the Rus-
sian Revolu-tion, Kurtzman told
the graduates that ‘-‘. . each
generation must ﬁnd its own
fresh adversity from which ‘to
recoil. This is the first thing you
have taught me.

“The second thing I have learn-
ed in the past few years is 
Because social relationships are
changing so rapidly, we must
learn not to accept stereotypes.”
Dr. Kurtzrnan referred to “. . .
stereotypes of your own making
— stereotypes about politicians,
or generals, or southerners, or
school administrators.”

Reminiscing back to his own
Imdergraduate days, Dr. Kurtz-
man’s third point of learning
was “. . . thatlittle things, which
don’t seem very important at
the time, often Weigh most
heavily in our lives.” As an ex-
ample, Dr. Kurtzman used -his
early interest in political sci-
ence which later climaxed in his
position as secretary of admin-
istration under the late Gover-
nor David L. Lawrence.

“And,” he said, “that brings
me up to a final point . . . you
must have -continuing know-
ledge, fresh each day, like bread
from the bakery.”

Fioliowingi his address, Chan-.
cellor Kurtzman awarded .the

degrees to the Pitt -graduates

  A Criterion For Action

--*-.'>_-;-,3 , ~. ~  . - i.

 

In delivering his Commencement address to the graduating class
Wednesday, Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtzman made a very signi-
ﬁcant point: “Don't replace (the stereotypes of your parents’ generation)
with stereotypes-of your own making, either stereotypes about politicians,

. or generals, or southerners, or school administratoi-s.’? We can carry that
statement one step further and caution students not to accept stereotyped
images of one another.

All too frequently we witness students typing other students and
judging them by exteriors. This was most pronounced during the last
Student Government presidential campaign when students who fancied
themselves liberals rallied to one side and_ those who preferred the labels
“conservative” and “moderate” chose their candidate accordingly. The

. careful observer at the several ‘political rallies during the campaign could

easily note how students responded to the labels that satisﬁed their own

needs at the expense of actually weighing the issues that so vitally con-

cern our student body.
The need to publicly display one’s political allegiance appeared in

the-form of countless “workers” who argued incessantly about the merits»

of their candidate, proud to publicize the rightness of their particular
choice. Students even wore buttons and small signs to make sure that
everyone knew who they favored. _ . .

Regretfully, this activity did not amount in any lasting improve-

ment in student interest in our governing body. One cannot wear labels dur-
ing the courseof the year as one doesat campaign time. The steps to-
ward making signiﬁcant contributions are not as simple as drawing a
campaign poster or distributing literature. All of this is reflected in the
increased ineffectiveness of our student organizations.

We would like to state for the record that the superﬁcial division
of our student body along fabricated party lines only serves to allow our
Administration to do exactly as it pleases, fully aware\ that a united stu-
dent body is a ﬁgment of the imagination.

Fortunately, there are concerned students whose interest trans-
cends “party” lines ‘who have taken the initiative to make our ad-

ministrators realize the importance of consulting students in decisions

that directly affect. us. This is a realtively small number, however, even in
regard to those students who term themselves politically active. The ma-
jority in that category are too concerned with blatantly displaying their
own political views to cooperate in "non-partisan efforts. A
We «feel that this state of inactivity is a direct result of preoccupa-
tion with ﬁtting a desirable stereotype. «
We urge students to heed Dr. Kurtzman’s words that “Stereotypes

"are a dreadful handicap to progress.” For only by looking beyond the

labels we so carelessly give’ ourselves and others can we actually accom-
plish the goals we continually espouse yet always fall short of attaining.

 

Vietnam :War Causes Change

V-THERE HASN’T been a
major confrontation between
the United States and the
Soviet Union since the Cu-
ban Missile Crisis of 1962.
Many Kremlinologists have
argued that the Soviet Union
has since evolved into a con-

" servative, consumer - orient-

ed state under the dual
leadership of Premier Kosy-
gin and Party Secretary
Brezhnev.

At one extreme, Eric

  Froehm has said that the

USSR is now totally concern-
ed with internal, primarily
consumer affairs. At the
other extreme are those who
still regard the Soviet Union
as a, monolithic entity whose
ultimate goal is to conquer
the world.

Most analysts and U.S. po-
licy-makers are somewhere
in the middle. They recog-
nize both “soft” and “hard”
line elements in the to!) So-
viet leadership. with “soft-
liners” currently predomin-
ating.

Apparently, the policy-mak-

ers have recently let other

considerations take priority-

over this crucial one. The
escalation of the Vietnam
War by the Johnson Admin-
istration to a level of daily
bombings of the Hanoi and
Haiphong areas has ended
the dominance of the “soft-
liners” in the Soviet echelon;
_ Dr. Robert Scalapino, when
he was here last April in
answer to a question’ about
what effect the bombing of
the North has had on US-
USSR relations, said, “I

Soviet ‘Hardliners’ Dominate

tional trade fair. They snub-
bed the American booth.
This -was the same Kosy-
gin, _who only two or three
months ago, was reported by
Ne‘-vsweek to be actively en-
gaged in efforts to bring
about peace in Vietnam.
AND NOW in the Middle
East crisis, the Soviets didn’t
hestiate in answering the
Arab‘ appeal for help. While
the U.S. appeared stunned
by Nasseris actions,*virtually
afraid to say anything that
might provoke either side,
Soviet Ambassador to the
United Nations, Nikolai, Fe-
dorenko, declared, “Should
anyone try to unleash ag-
gression in the Near East he
would be met notonly with
the united strength of Arab
countries, but also with
strong opposition to aggres-
sion from the Soviet Union.”
Today Nasser boasts of
complete military support
from the Soviet Union. The
obvious explanation is that
the Soviets knew of the
Arab plans and sanctioned
them. But the Soviets had
never trusted Nasser before.
Why should they have com-
mitted themselves so irrevo-
cably behind him now‘?
Furthermore, the Soviets
have turned down a propos-
al for Big‘ Four talks aimed
at settling the crisis; U. S.
naval commanders in the
Mediterranean have report-
ed Russian trawlers observ-
ing Sixth Fleet maneuvers;
and Soviet naval vessels have
acquired permission to sail
through the Turkish straits
and into the Mediterranean,
thus creating the possibility
of direct naval contact.‘ ,
ADMITTEDLY, the evi-
dence is circumstantial.
There haven’t been any high-
level personnel changes in
the Soviet Government other
than a new head of the KGB.
But one can't help but draw
the conclusion that the
“hardliners” have regained
inﬂuence, because of Ameri-
can policy in Vietnam.
And the ﬁrst confronta-
tion between the two nations
since 1962 has become a real

Admission Policy

The Commuter Haven

by Paul Stoller

WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA University? This is per.
haps the .most appropriate term that can be given to the
University at ‘this time. The University is now under. the
stagnating grips. of. a regionalism, caused by the lack of
foresightand initiative on the part of the Admissions office.

Aboutthree years ago, the University was considered
a_ cosmopolitan institution with a wide geographic distribu-
tion of students. After a ten-year program of progress, the
University is now back on the road of regression.

It is a road of regression because of the failure of the
Admissions office to maintain: a suitable “cosmopolitan mix.”
Three years ago, 40 per cent of t-he freshman class were
out-of-state students. Last. year, the percentage dipped to
30 per cent. This year's “2,000 Best” present the University
with its worst “cosmopolitan mix." Only 20 per cent of
the in-coming freshman class will be out-of-state students.
This means that 400 of the 2,000 best could be classiﬁed
as “out-of-staters.” This number is lamentably insufficient.

V YET, THE Admissions people say that the situation
cannot be helped. They have complained about tardiness of
the out-of-state applications and the lack of University hous-
ing. “We have no choice on the out-of-state ratio,” said
Jack B. Critchfield,.dean of Admissions and soon-to-be dean
of student affairs. “A lot of the out-of-state applications
come late, many as late as April. These are people for
whom Pitt is the second choice.”

Under the present policy, all applications are proces-
sed as soon as they are received-in the Admissions office.
Thus, the Pennsylvania applicant who sends in his appli-
cation at an earlier date has a better chance of being ac-
cepted than the out-of-state student who tends to ﬁle his
application at a later date. This allows for an overwhelming
inﬂux of Pennsylvania sudents.

Moreover, the Admissions office states that the Uni-
versity can only accommodate 400 mien and 350 women of
the in-coming class. Thus, according to an article in the
Pitt Alumni, “The vital cosmopolitan -mix in the freshman
student body will suffer for a couple of years, until the new
dorms are built.”

THE FRESHMAN student body cannot afford to suf-
fer for a few years. The Admissions office must make
a choice of the out-of-state ratio. That choice is simply to
maintain the downward trend of the “vital ratio,” making
the University a commuters haven, or to reassess this seri-
ous situationand make some needed changes in admissions
policies.

The most important change is to scrap the present ad-
missions policy. Instead of reviewing applications on a ﬁrst
come, ﬁrst serve basis, the applications should also be pro-
cessed after a certain set date. This would give both the
‘Pennsylvania and out-of-state student an equal chance of
being accepted. This system is by far the most,equitable
method of admission. ' ’ -

The limitation of housing problem could be resolved
by a bit of foresight on the part of the Admissions office.
The recently formulated Off-campus Housing Committee
could provide housing for in-coming freshman men. More-
over, with the space saved by housing freshman men in
Oakland, a great many more spaces would be open for
women. "

These ideas have not been effectively enacted in the
past. But a new approach is needed to destroy the stagna-
tion that hovers over the University. The Admissions of-
ﬁce is the lifeline of the University. Its current policy re-
gretfully brings upon the University a new staleness—the
staleness of decay. »

Lewis: ‘Under the Con

.k\

by MIKE BROURMAN

In April, baseball coach Bobby Lewis ﬂatly predicted
that his team would go undefeated. Two month later, with
13’victories, three losses and the disappointment of not re-
ceiving an NCAA bid behind him, Lewis still thinks as high-
ly of his players as he did on that cold April afternoon.

“When you win 13 out of 16,
you've got to say it's been a
good season,” explained Lewis.
“But under the conditions, it
was more than that. It was a
tremendous year.

“I couldn't be prouder of the
boys," he continued. “They were
tenecious. They hung in there
even at times when we couldn't

practice for a week at a time be- .

cause of the weather. I'm as
proud of them as I’ve been of
any team.”

This was a team which had

pressure and never did accord-
ing to Lewis.‘“'l‘wice we were
down to our last strike in games
we were behind in,‘ but they
came back to win both games.
That’s what kind of group they
are.” "

The low point of. the season,
of course, was the pair of close
defeats to Penn State, but even
in these Lewis found room to
praise his team.

“If ever a team was going to

time. But they came right back

But Lewis is conﬁdent that his
