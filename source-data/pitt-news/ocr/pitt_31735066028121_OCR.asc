Home-grown airwaves

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

Each Friday night, everyone within a
30—mile radius of the Pitt campus is
invited to the same party.

Directions are simple: ﬂip the switch
on your radio, tune it to 92.1 on the FM
dial. and you’re there. The hub of this
party is WPTS, the university’s own
radio station, and the host is Blakk Steel.

At the station, about ten friends crowd
around the DJ in the small studio, while
others relax in the station’s lobby. The
room buzzes with an energy strong
enough to penetrate the airwaves of the
station’s broadcasting range.

Proof is in the non-stop calls that pour
in from the listeners, who are eager to
make requests. This is not an unusual
occurrence here at WPTS. The station
thrives on the energy generated within
its walls.

The station operates in block program- 

WPTS mixes it up

show dedicated to the music of Frank
Zappa, making this station “alternative”
in the true sense of the word.

“No other station in Pittsburgh is play-
ing this music,” Nicole Narvaez said as
she and two friends lounged on the
couch in the PTS lobby, listening to
Blakk Steel’s award-winning rap show.

Blakk Steel spins old-school rap and

‘rap and metal to reggae, and even a Rich Puerzer of WPTS puts his show together.

B-sides unlikely to be heard anywhere,
least likely to be heard on commercial
radio.

“A lot of this stuff is hard to find, and
it’s not being represented truthfully,” he
says.

The same sentiments are echoed by

many of the DJs at PTS. They see the

Faculty question post-tenure review proposal

By Anthony Breznican
Staff Writer

Faculty Assembly delayed its decision
on a proposal by ex-chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor to review tenured fac-
ulty performance, because members
feared his proposal might limit academ-
ic freedom.

Because there is no mandatory retire-
ment age for faculty members, former

Chancellor O’Connor had put forth a 9

plan to review tenured faculty in order
to make sure they were still productive.
But the assembly members said at
their Tuesday meeting that they felt it to
be unnecessary.
“Faculty goes through a review
process with their immediate supervisor

Columnist Duﬁng
Dr. Robert the 1994-95 academic
Gallagher year, an Alcohol
' Abuse Task Force at
Pitt met to discuss the extent of the alcohol
problem on this campus.
The task force report has only recently been
released by Leon Haley, vice chancellor for stu-

dent affairs. It was concluded by the task force

that the excessive use of alcohol here, as at

‘many other institutions, contributes signiﬁcant-

ly to academic failure, emotional and physical
(Dr. Gallagher is the director of the
Counseling Center)

every year, and that’s always been the
case,” said Keith McDuffie, Senate
president. “It’s been part of the faculty
handbook for years.”

O’Connor didn’t realize that tenured
faculty are also reviewed, McDuffie
said, though with tenure, faculty don’t
have as much pressure to conform to
“what [the] chair or clean think [the fac-
ulty member] ought to be doing in the
way of research, teaching and so forth.”

Other problems with O’Connor’s pro-
posal concerned the mediation process
between -a tenured member of faculty
and that member’s dean in the case that
a disagreement did erupt. Mediation is
not binding in the proposal, which takes
away the negotiation power of a tenured
faculty member.

health problems, sexually transmitted diseases,
physical and sexual assaults on campus, vandal-
ism and even the suicide rate among college
students.

You will be reading more about the recom-
mendations of the task force, but in this column
I want to write a more personal message to stu-
dents who may have an alcohol problem.

Alcohol abuse is a difﬁcult topic to write
about on a college campus, because there are
such varied opinions about what constitutes
abuse. Drinking has always been a part of the
social structure of college campuses, and since
so many people enjoy it, it is not likely to disap-
pear as a part of college social life.

“This language gives the administra-
tion a lot of  leverage to put the pres-
sure on, and that, I think, is an infringe-
ment of academic freedom,” McDuffie
said.

The assembly also discussed possible
pay raises for the fiscal year 1997.
-Faculty salaries were frozen for the fis-
cal year 1996 because of budget restric-
tions.

Philip Wion of the Senate Budget
Policies Committee made a proposal for
salary increases of three percent.

This proposal recognizes that current
faculty salaries have been frozen, but it
does not try to make up for the loss fac-
ulty will feel due to inflation. The pro-
posal will ensure that failure to keep up
with inﬂation will not occur next year.

, Alcohol abuse can make a
° mess in all areas of life

As a psychologist, however, I become con-
cemed about alcohol usage when it begins to
interfere with a student’s emotional or physical
well-being, social relationships or performance
in school. I also become concerned when it is
used as a drug to manage anxiety, depression or
other feelings.

How do you know when your drinking is
becoming a problem? There are a number of
waming signs:

°You are unable to remember what happened
after you were drinking.

°You typically drink until you are drunk.

°You feel anxious if you go a day without

British and Irish talk about disarming the IRA

 World Events

DUBLIN — Irish and British
officials say they are moving
closer to resolving the dispute
over the disarmament of the
Irish Republican Army and to
the scheduling of full—fledged
discussions. The issues have
blocked the Northern Ireland
peace effort for months.

Following much verbal
warfare in the past few
months, public statements
have begun to soften in the
last week and officials say a
deal should be worked out in
the near future.

Until now, Britain had
insisted that the I.R.A. begin
disarmament before talks

' could resume, and the I.R.A

had insisted that Britain set a
date for talks before it would
consider disbanding. The New
York Times

LYONS, France — French
youths burned 60 cars,
smashed windows and pelted
the police with stones for a
third night of rioting yester-
day after the murder of a man
suspected in a bombing by
French paratroopers. .

The youths sent garbage
cans into flames, smashed
telephone booths and
destroyed bus stations to
show their outrage. More than
300 police officers were sent

to the scene in Lyons. The

KENYA — A former mem-

found guilty after a 19-month

WASHINGTON — Ruling in
a redistricting case in
Tennessee, the Supreme Court
indicated that districts in
which black voters are numer-
ous enough to influence the
outcome of elections may in
some circumstances be valid
alternatives under the Voting
Rights Act to the creation of
additional majority black dis-
tricts.

The Court has suggested
that inﬂuence districts can be
a redistricting option, but it
has never ruled directly on the
question. The New York Times

BATON ROUGE —
Hurricane Opal grew stronger
and faster in the Gulf of
Mexico yesterday as it
swirled towards offshore oil
and gas platforms and the
coast stretching from
Louisiana to Florida.

The storm has been the
cause of seven drownings in
the Mexican state of Tabasco.
Winds strengthened to 100
mph, and forecasters at the
National Hurricane center
said Opal was likely to strike
land sometime after midnight
on Wednesday but that it was
too early to pinpoint the most
likely target. Pittsburgh Post-

station’s programming as a break from the monotony of commer-
cial radio —— the kind that dictates which artists should be" played
and when. You won’t be hearing Bryan Adams or Hootie and the
Blowﬁsh once an hour on this station. '

Such breaks from the conformist, mechanical programming
that is customary in today’s radio market may seem revolution-
ary, but it’s actually a retreat to the basics of when radio began,
says PT S. ’

“We do it the old-fashioned way,” says station manager Dino
Lopreiato. ,

DJ s have the opportunity to choose from any of the CDs in the
station’s collection, which numbers over a thousand, or from the
countless vinyl records and 45s that range from groups as
obscure as The Ugly Americans to those “what ever happened to
them” acts like Quiet Riot.

For some DJ s like Gary Warchock, doing it the old-fashioned
way has a special meaning. Warchock, a Pitt alumni, dee-jays an
oldies show Friday mornings 6-8 a.m. He specializes in music
from the pre-British invasion period, the kind that started the
rock n’ roll era. For Warchock, each song brings, back memories
of his teenage years. .

Warchock searches through his black, tattered box of 45s,
taken from his personal collection, for “Foot Stompin”’ by The
Flares. As he finds the 45, a listener’s request, Warchock notes
the reason for the overwhelming number of callers he gets at this
early hour. These are the songs to which people fell in love but
which they haven’t heard in three decades.

“For two hours every Friday I go off into another world and
turn the clock back 30 years,” he says. A ' ’

For Warchock it’s nostalgia: he was there. But for Stan “the
Music Man” Knox, a senior sociology major who follows
Warchock’s set with more oldies from 8 to 10 a.m., it’s a longing
to have been there.

“I would have loved to graduate in 1959 and gone to Vietnam,”
Knox says. .

Instead, he lives it through the music. Standing behind the
microphone, he exudes enough energy for three people, at an
hour when most his age are just rolling out of bed.

Knox plays the more “contemporary” brand of oldies, the kind
that Warchock’s listeners hate. He spins tunes from Buddy Holly,
the Beach Boys, the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield.

While Warchock can speak from experience, Knox gets a little
help from the Internet. He shouts a happy birthday to artists who
are, or would have been, celebrating that day, and recalls impor-
tant dates from 1959 from a list he’s printed off the Net.

gelist.

This particular afternoon,
over the background of tribal
chanting, Mad Mike places
curses on those who have
wronged him. When it comes
to the musical line-up, Mad
Mike sets his own rules. Where
else would you here a version
of “Hava Nagi1a” in the same
set as AC/DC’s “Highway to

These specialty sets add color

drinking.

-You get into fights or lose
friends because of your drinking.

°You go on drinking binges, or
are unable to perform sexually.

Any of these symptorris suggest
that alcohol is beginning to control
your life, and when more than one
of these is present, you may
already have a serious problem.

What can you do ifyou are con-
cerned about your drinking habits?

For a start, it’s a good idea to
avoid judging yourself too harshly.

.Not all people with a drinking

problem are alcoholics, nor are
they irresponsible, failures or bad
people. Alcohol abuse can result

from attempts to cope with stress,

depression, loneliness, anxiety,
pressure and also from strong peer
pressures. Recognizing that you
are drinking more than you should
is the ﬁrst step to changing you

behavior.

Some college students may
indeed be on their way to becom-
ing alcoholics and may never. be
able to control their use of alcohol
except through complete absti-
nence. Many, however, can learn
to drink moderately and to enjoy
the use of alcohol now and in their
post-college years.

If you are concenied about your
drinking habits, talk to your ﬁiends
about it. If you can’t make
progress with the problem on your
own, seek some help.

There are many support services
available on campus. A drug and
alcohol program is available at the
Student Health Service; counselors
are available at the Counseling
Center; and there is a student drug
and alcohol recovery group on
campus. If your goal is to become
a responsible or moderate drinker,
I suggest that when you do drink,
you:
°Drink slowly, perhaps pacing
yourself with moderately drinking
ﬁiends.

°Alternate alcoholic and non-
alcoholic beverages.

°Drink on a full stomach.

°Don’t let others controlyour
drinking style and learn to say no
thanks when you don’t want
another drink.

The use of alcohol can add plea-
sure to your life, but it can also
make a mess of it Emerson said,
“A man will be eloquent if you
give him good wine,” but Ben
Franklin advised that “he that
drinks fast, pays slow.”

For a lot of people, midterm stress should be setting in right

- about now. You finally realized that paper you have been putting

off for a month or so is not going to write itself. That’s it! No
more procrastination. We are all going to get off of our butts and
go to the computer labs.

Unfortunately, that seems to be exactly what everyone is
doing. In case you are one of the rare few who is not in this situ-
ation right now, you should walk by the computer labs some
time. If you thought the lines at Disney World were bad, you
should check out the labs right now.

When you get your bill for the semester, you might notice a
$110 charge titled “Computer Fee.” Even if you don’t have a
computer account, you have to pay this fee. But no matter, if
you do have an account you have no guarantee that you will find
a computer when you need one.

If you walk through the floors of Hillman Library this week, .
you will probably notice that every fifth or so computer has a
sign pasted to it disclaiming whatever technical malfunction the
machine is experiencing. Then you will notice that every third
or so computer that is working is logged into unix or vms, since
we all know how crucial it is to get that note to a friend three
computers away. (There is supposed to be a policy regarding use
of computers and priority users, but it is rarely enforced.) The
remaining computers will be populated with glassy-eyed
humanoids who have been metamorphosed by the radiation
emitting from the monitor for the past 38 hours.

Of course, after a certain time you will be told that you had
better save whatever you are doingbecause the computer
lab/library will be closing in five minutes. It is not important
that you only convinced the net surfer to let you have the com-
puter ten minutes ago. If you don’t listen to this advice, you will
lose whatever you have done because the main power source
will be disconnected in 4 minutes 54 seconds. -

There are only two computer labs open 24 hours a day,
Benedum and Sutherland Halls (the two labs furthest away from
the main part of campus), and those only between Monday and
Thursday. On Friday afternoon, don’t expect to get anything
done, since all labs except Benedum close before 7 p.m. And
don’t even bother getting up earlypover the weekend, since none
of the labs open before 10 a.m. (most don’t even open until
noon) on the weekend. Now we realize that, as a rule, college
students don’t like to spend Friday nights or weekend mornings
in front of a computer screen, but sometimes it is necessary. And
the facilities are not available when it is necessary.

Next time you are in the lab and you think you absolutely
need to e-mail that friend with whom you just had lunch, make
sure no one is waiting to use a computer. And perhaps CIS
might even consider making the computers accessible during
more of the day. .

Oh yeah, if you hadn’t remembered about that paper yet, for-
get you saw this. There is no need to go to the computer lab.

"Publish or Perish"

ublish
or per-
ish, the

maxim of
academe, has
been twisted
by the
Unabomber
into: Publish
or someone
will Perish.
Posingjas a
surreptitious-
ly clandestine journalist with
the mindset of an extremist
politician, the Unabomber
has single-handedly brought
journalism from its tradition’-
al absolute independence
into a newer era of journalis-
tic ethics stressing. communi-
ty responsibility.

Faced with the agony of
making a controversial deci-
sion, The Washington Post
and The New York Times
agreed to co-sponsor publi-
cation of the Unabomber’s
dictum as an eight-page,
35,000-word insert in The
Post. The Unabomber threat-
ened to engage in more vio-
lent acts of terrorism if the
two media giants did not
unconditionally comply with
his demands. In the
Unabomber’s 17-year cam-
paign of sending bombs
through the mail, three peo-
ple have been killed and 23
injured by his deranged
escapades.

The elusive Unabomber
has promised to put an indef-
inite halt to his premeditated
murders so long as his dia-
tribe stating the detriments

of technological advance-
ment and liberals in our soci-
ety was published. Many
opponents of The Post’s and
The Times’ decision to pub-
lish the Unabomber’s mani-
festo argue that the media,
particularly journalism, has
now lost its reputation of
publishing stories that
inform, educate and expose.
These opponents are now
saying that the media has
now been taken prisoner by
the government and that
journalism has simultaneous-
ly been taken hostage by law
enforcement, government
and radical extremists. They
believe that media is no
longer operating as it was
designed to — as an inde-
pendent immune to outside
inﬂuences.

In contrast to the opposi-
tion, supporters argue that
The Post and Times’ decision
to print the tract was'made in
order to protect the best
interests of the community.
Donald Graham, publisher of
The Post, and Times publish-
er Arthur Sulzberger have
both said that publication of
the manifesto was “not an
issue of the First
Amendment,” but a decision
“centered on the role of a
newspaper as a part of the
community.” The publishers’
decision may be justified
because of the growing pub-
lic resentment of editors as
arrogant and insensitive self-
interested press lords. To
counter the growing tide of
people believing that jour-

mandate  

nalists have become self-
interested lobbyists exempt-
ed from responsibility to the
community, The Post and
The Times agreed to adopt a
new stance of “civic” jour-
nalism by publishing the
Unabomber’s essay. It is
journalism which the public
has been longing for — jour-
nalism with a personal touch,
a human face. Acting as a
spokesman for civic journal-
ism, or “advocacy” journal-
ism, Sulzberger responded to
opponents by saying, “What
have you lost? The cost of
newsprint?” By voicing his
heart-felt opinion and resort-
ing to instincts rather than
image, Sulzberger confront-
ed the bitter, critical press
with indomitable, unques-
tionable logic.

Sulzberger and Graham are
heroes, mentors and brave,
brave men. In the face of
enemy fire, they steadfastly
ventured into unknown terri-
tory to make the rational and
responsible decision. In
return for their meritorious
efforts, they gained the
respect, regard and reverie of
the readers; satisfied the
Unabomber’s cutthroat
appetite; and most impor-
tantly, acted as civic leaders
in throwing down their

guards in the face of fierce -

criticism to protect the best
interests of the people —
like members of a closely
knit community.

game. Many
probably
were sur-
prised when the Tale of the
Tape ran out. How about last
week when Virginia Tech
didn’t need keys to win the
game? Pitt opened the damn
door for them.

The students are upset. The
fans are upset. The entire city
is upset. But nobody is think-

It has to be hard to start off
the year with two big wins
and then to respond with
three straight losses. What
makes it worse is that two of
those games should have
been wins.

Pitt lost to Texas in a game
in which the Panthers totally
outplayed the opposition, but
bad luck reared its ugly head
yet again for Majors and Co.

Ohio State came to town
with about 30,000 fans and
left with a lopsided win.

“Dave Bessmieth_ [the
assistant coach] called me
and notified me over the
phone,” Youndt said. He
added that “it was a shock,
and I didn’t know how to
react.” . ..

“Things had swung that
direction and back again so
many times,” Youndt said.
Since teams had been cut
around the country he “ knew
it was a possibility from the
time I started. We were con-
stantly staring down the bar-
rel of the gun that said we
weren’t going to be around
anymore.”

For tennis the cut was
unexpected. The sound of the
tennis ball hitting a racket,
the click of the locker, the
sound of sneakers across the
court, the pong of the ball
after a really hard serve —
these were part of the tennis
team’s life day after day. An
athlete’s life revolves around
practice. .

When asked if he still plays
tennis, Mike Sullivan, who
was a member of the tennis
team, responded, “I practice
every day," then qualified it
to: “everyday that I normally
would have attended practice
at Pitt.”

“Heart is what separates us from other teams,” pitcher

rest of us will have to step it up.”

Campbell was the team’s workhorse during last year’s
stellar season, and DeBernardis was the go-to guy, leading

The experience gained from last year’s post-season run
will be a valuable asset to the returning Panthers.

“We know what it takes to win. We came together as a

which is going to the Olympics
in Atlanta, and none were going
to become professional tennis
players. To most of the athletes,
playing in college was some-
thing they just had to do,
because they had done so their
entire lives.

College competition also
meant added credentials. With
enough credentials from their
college career, some of them
could have coached after col-
lege.

~Asked if he planned to contin-
ue with gymnastics after college,
Youndt replied that he didn’t.
When asked specifically about
coaching, he replied, “Of course.
I would have liked to coach little
kids. It’s been such a large part
of my life.” ~

The athletes still have their

scholarships and will continue to
carry them until they graduate.

“The greatest priority is taking
care of the students and making
sure they make progress towards
their degree,” Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes said. “The athletic
career is important, but the com-
mitment for your education is
something that will last a life-
time.”

At least two dozen athletes
will no longer compete. Instead,
women will be able to come to
the university and play soccer.

“We will phase in the scholar-
ships over a period of years,”
Jaynes said. »

The Athletic Department is on
the verge of hiring a coach who
will immediately start recruiting
a team that will begin scheduled
play in 1996. Jaynes hopes that
current students will help form

the new team. .

“The writers of Title IX didn’t
want things to happen this way,”
D’Amico says.

The struggle to interpret Title
IX continues, and “a way of
life,” as D’Amico also terms it,
ends for these athletes at Pitt.

For D’Amico, sports “helped
me get out of the gutter and gave
me everything I have today.” He

earned his college degree,

through sports scholarships and
went on to a Ph.D.‘ in biostatis-
tics. No longer coaching, he
teaches biostatistics at
Duquesne.

He received his education-

through sports and so will his
former athletes. Pitt brought the
athletes here with a promise of
an education and a chance to
compete. The university has
-honored the first promise. '

question. I thought our game plan was tremendous.”

Granted, the Panthers were bitten by the injury bug
when West, J ells and Harris went down, but that should
make the rest of the team try to step up. Or at least one
would think so, but what do we know: we’re just fans,
right? \

What about the play of the game? It’s a tough deci-
sion. Does it go to John Ryan and his fourth-and-ten
pass that sailed over the Tech bench? What about a cer-
tain defensive back, who shall remain nameless, and his
attempt to give up the longest play in school history?
How about the quick kick that followed two blocked
punts when the team was in need of a score? I would
love to vote on it, but what do we know: we’re just
fans, right?

Fans from all around are excited about how far the
Panthers can go this year, but it does not look so good
anymore. Pitt needs a new wrinkle in the mix, some-
thing to keep the opponents off-guard. But first thing
first, get rid of Roe and bring back the panther.

Department of Economics

Jan Svejnar, Economic Advisor to President Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic, is a
prominent player in the reconstruction of socialist economies in Europe. His hands-on
engagements include Directorship of the Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences
of the Czech Republic and Chairmanship of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of
the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education of Charles University in Prague.
Professor Svejnar is Co-Director of the Transition Programme of the Center for Economic
Policy Research and Consultant to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, both in London. He has published extensively on the privatization of
socialist economies since receiving his doctorate from Princeton in 1979. This lecture
promises privileged insights from the catbird seat.

I don’t know, but I have this
theory: all of the bands that I
interviewed must have started
their illustrious music careers
with a Radio Shack 64-in-one
kit. They probably threw out
the manuals and just started
hooking up wires to the little
springs and were on their way
to

There is a small experimen-
tal scene in Pittsburgh. Most of
the bands are new; all are
potentially dangerous. One

\j——___

such band is 40 Stories. The
group is a startling free jazz
quartet featuring Kevin Shea
on the drum set, Oliver Kollar
on the electric guitar, Dan
Bodwell on the contra bass
and Micah Gaugh on the alto
sax. What is 40 Stories trying
to do with its music? Shea
commented, “40 Stories is a
non-intentional call to awaken
what actually is.” Perhaps this
is more appropriately phrased
by Kollar: “Shut up and play,
man!” “Exactly!” screamed
Shea. ‘

And they can sure play.
Gaugh, currently.residing in
NYC, was recently part of
Cecil Taylor's band, and the
group just played the Knitting
Factory. This is not the typical
improvisational group, though.
Shea explains that much of the
material is plotted out in dia-
gram form or consists of draw-
ings composed by Gaugh_ (see
figure 1). Each musician inter-
prets the diagram and plays
accordingly._ The diagrams are
rehearsed and perfromed in
shows. 40 Stories appears on
Litmus Test, a cassette of

 

experimental music put out on
SSS Records.

Shea. is also active in one of
Pittsburgh's newest groups,’
Storm and Stress. Storm and
Stress is a trio also featuring
Ian Willims (of Don Cab) on
guitar and George Dragons (of
T4, Don Cab, etc.) on electric‘
bass. Williams informs that the
Storm and Stress Group con-
sists of not only three musi-
cians, but also three photogra-
phers and one advisor. When
asked what role the advisor

W

;\\)\

plays in the group, he barked,
“He is an unnamed member of
the intelligencia/cognescenti
and advises us during ques-
tion and answer debreifings
that we have after each of our
shows. The advisor also sug-
gested that we change our
name to Storm and Duress, or
Storm and Undress.”
Musically, the trio is a combi-
nation of subtle guitar sound-
scapes and bombastic drums;
the bass holds everything
together. Williams remarked
that “Storm and Stress is a
program to make the world
beautiful again and  oh yes,
to abolish the practice of walk-
ing down the street with your
friends and in synchronicity,
jumping on the count of four as
if in a water ballet and, finally,
for finding a solution to the
lack of modern fidelity options.
In sum: no-fi.” The group’s first
release is going to be a book.
Swob is a band that is con-
stantly reinventing itself.
Known to many as “noise rock-
ers,” Swob has evolved into an
improvisational-based sound
experiment using non-tradi-

tional objects as instruments.

The group consists of John
Eberly on bass, Thad Bobula
and Steve Boyle on guitars,
and Todd Doehring on drums.
Eberly noted, “We approach
every gig as an individual
event: some shows we play a
more traditional rock fusion;

_ others we use toy instruments,

kitchen appliances, noise mak-
ers, and other various gad-
gets. We don’t write music; we
write sounds.” Boyle reiterat-
ed, “We attempt to take advan-
tage of the situation we find
ourselves in; we try to force
the hands of change.” Eberly
told me that when the band
composes songs it’s a total
group effort. “We record our
improvisations and piece
together the parts we like into
songs during our practice ses-
sions, “ which Boyle noted,
“are in a warehouse surround-
ed by broken down cars and
other junk  the room itself is
-sterile and filled with oscilators
and other sound generating
machinery, but no convention-
al instruments.” Whatever
Swob is doing, the goal is to
“create something out of noth-
ing,” which the reocords docu-
ment nicely —— Tragous 7”(Pop
Bus), Neutrinos 7' (Project A
Bomb), Percis Hussey tape (A
Bomb).

Probably the most enigmatic
of all of the bands is Revo.
Talking to them was most diffi-
cult. Revo is not a band: it’s a
phenomenon. Revo makes
sound (and a great deal of
sound at high volumes) with
computers, appliances and
keyboards. When asked about

the components of their sound.

they greeted me with a phren-
zy of electronic blips and static
that can only be poorly tran-
scribed into “bIeepdingoopbe-
miph-zzzzdolhum.” An answer
followed: “We are one part
biotechnology, part machinery-

tools.” The band has released
a lo-fi tape “Digitally
Remastered,” a 9-floppy disk
release of software written
by/for Revo (can be used on
Mac Power PC and Windows
95) and has an upcoming 7"
single out on SSS Records
entitled “Operation Re-
lnformation.” Re-Information is
the crux of Revo. It is “basical-
ly mind control for the human
race.” Revo further explains,
“We have a space alien influ-
ence  we're essentially pup-
pets, or fingertips of the mind
control.” Revo also instruct all
to “use Re-Information every-
day. it’s about tommorow’s
information, any information
for that matter, and making it
work for you.” Not only is Revo
a sonic phenomenon, it’s
equipped with an equation to
sum up its views (and which is
subsequentally the first song
on the new ep):

there was any advice for future
‘concert’ goers, Revo replied,
“Anyone who attends a show
with two spoons behind their
ears will be O.K. ”**

the above mentioned bands
are frothing mad lunatics or
science geeks with attitudes,
check out their live perfor-
mances.‘The music should
speak for itself.

note the spoon parabolic

It's not often that you come
across a line—up of movies so
likely never to be seen again.
Countering a closeted film
industry that would rather tip-
toe around homosexuality with
movies like Philadelphia, the
Pittsburgh International
Lesbian and Gay Film Festival
dishes up a week of frank,
independent releases.
Celebrating a decade-long run
this year, the festival has a his-
tory of bringing eye-opening
films into this particularly con-
servative town. The films
evoke qualities of truth and
naturalness that can only
come from the experiences of
the writers, actors and direc-
tors. This year’s event lines up
29 films ranging from experi-
mental flicks to international
award winners, as well as a
guest appearance by poet
John Giorno. The festival finds
its home in three locations this
year — the Rex Theater, the
Pittsburgh Playhouse and the
Andy Warhol Museum. .

For a Living: The Poetry of
Work

Edited by Nicholas Coles and
Peter Oresick

University of Illinois Press/
$18.95

Work is work for most of us.
Whether we’re actually work-
ing or avoiding work, it remains
the single dominating structure
in our lives. Funny how this
doesn't translate to the pre-
dominant subject matter of
modern poetry, though. As edi-
tors Nicholas Coles and Peter
Oresick note in the introduction
of their first anthology, Working
Classics: Poems on Industrial
Life, poetry has, throughout
the form’s history, been mostly
obsessed with the subjects of
love and death while ignoring
work as the stuff of lyrical
import.

Fortunately, the fractional-
ized, factionalized, fucked-up
morass that is contemporary
poetry does manage to be rel-

 evant to outside the academy.

But as we move out of the end
of big industry and into low-
wage/no-benefits service
industries, we get a different
breed of poem from the work-
er/writers in For A Living: The
Poetry of Work. Gone is the
direct violence of work and
work lost in factories, mills and
mines. It is now replaced by
the psychological drain of ster-
ile, fluorescent offices and
white—collar servitude. In Denis
Johnson’sr “White, White
Collars,” the rituals of office
work take on a surreal perver-

 

 

 

 

‘made

sion of our souls. The office is
a place where “you know our
clothes/ woke up this morning
and swallowed us like jewelsi
and ride up and down the ele-
vators, filled with us,/ turning
and returning like the spray of
light that goes around dance-
halls among dancing foo|s.”

In John Ashberry’s “The
Instruction Manual,” a writer
working on the “instruction
manual on the uses of a new
metal” escapes his mundane
task by dreaming up visions of
the far-off city of Guadalajara
only to return “back to the
instruction manual which has
me dream of
Guadalajara.” Here we catch a
glimpse of how the brutal
banality of most work drives us
elsewhere, if only in fantasies
of the mind.

But the occupations repre-
sented in For A Living are
more numerous than just office
workers and spread all across
race, gender, class and other
spectrums. We get stockbro-
kers, stenographers, teachers,
social service workers, even
writers. In almost all cases, we

Qieriecfum Center

 

get poignant and sometimes
disturbing pictures of labor’s
toll.

In Mark Defoe’s “A Former
Miner Returns from His First
Day as a Service Worker,” a
coal miner suffers the humilia-
tion of working in the radically
new environs of the kitchen at
McDonald’s. He ends a first
day on the job where, “He has
never been so tired./His hands
have never been so clean.”

Local poet Jan Beatty rails
against asshole customers in
“A Waitress’s Instructions on
Tipping” by reversing the role
for once and providing an
amusing and bile-filled list
requesting what to do and not
to do to a waitress. She tells
us, “If you leave less than 10%
eat at home;” “Never leave
pennies at all;’’ “Remember
that I am somebody’s mother
or daughter;” “Don’t say, Here
honey this is for you — ever”
— and all this because, “If
you’re miserable, there’s never
enough money in the world._”

Pitt professor Toi Derricotte
offers up the literal experience
of labor in her poem on giving

birth in Delivery, while CMU
faculty member Jim Daniels
gives us the compelling
dreams of a minimum wage
cleaner in “Night Janitor,
McMahon Oil.” The local flavor
of this anthology may reflect its
collection by Pitt professor
Coles and University Press
director Oresick but both go to
great pains to keep these
three-hundred-plus pages of
poems as diverse as possible
by including a wide range of
work from U.S. and Canadian
poets. What the abundance of
work by writers with some local
connection might really say is
that this is a place where poet-
ry of this kind thrives and is
welcomed.

Despite the requisite works
from the likes of eminent liter-
ary figures like Joyce Carol
Oates and John Updike and
the more famous poets like
Phillip Levine, Tess Gallagher
and David Ignatow, For A
Living is mostly populated by
the worker/writer —— folks who
make their living outside the lit-
erary world, yet who bring so
much to it by bringing their

work and lives to the poetry. It
is this special kind of writing
wrought in detailed experience
that leaves this anthology
reeking of a broad relevance
and artistry that’s rare and real
enough to inform us all on both
our own labor and others.

Safe

Directed by Todd Haynes
With Julianne Moore and
James LeGros

Take it or leave it: Todd
Haynes’ Safe does not work.
lt’s slick, well-made and
pedantic — so controlled that
the only thing surprising is
how goddamned boring it all
is. The Safe advertising logo

and title in the opening credits
is written as [Safe] to infer
enclosed spaces, something
sanitized and not free, claus-
trophobic. Pretty clever, since
the moral of the story is direct-
ed at those already living with
a fatal disease — AIDS, can-
cer, or an “environmental ill-
ness” — telling them not to
retreat from ‘‘life.’’

Haynes would have loved
the air-conditioned Pittsburgh
Playhouse Sunday night; its
sterility approached an inter-
active approach, and at least
one person got the point and
walked out. I would have beat-
en him to the door had I not

,5 /%§;%;,.,g

movie justice and see it
through.

Haynes is gonna make you
suffer along with his charac-
ters to get the point. You'll sit
through two hours of minimal
dialogue, slow action and self-
conscious camera movement.
[Safe]‘focuses on Carol White,
a housewife “living” in a posh
suburban So-Cal mansion,
who splits her time decorating

the house and doing
aerobics. Her mar-
riage is cold, her
lifestyle sanitized.
When she becomes
ill, she goes to doc-
tor after doctor, but
none can tell her the
source of her prob-
lems. A visit to the psychiatrist
proves futile as well.

Haynes gives us shot after
sterile shot which hammers
home the ennui and empti-
ness of Carol’s life. Haynes
has got the overdetermined
Kubrick track down, with equal
skill in shooting wide-open
spaces to counterpoint Carol’s
cloistered life. lt’s the retreat
from the “real” that's at issue
in Safe. When Carol’s stepson
brings home his report and
describes inner-city violence,
Carol naively responds, “Does
it have to be so gory?” Carol’s
eventually diagnosed with
some sort of environmental ill-

ness and moves to
Wrenwood, a retreat where no
germs or bacteria can harm
her. She uses an oxygen tank
to breath, wears a mouth
guard and is led by one truly
sick, preacher-type in this not-
so-brave new world.

Carol’s descent into sterility
bottoms out when she moves
into a bubble at Wrenwood.
Her non-life life is, yes, a
metaphor. It is a metaphor for
people with fatal illnesses who
have given up on living life,
given into the fear of death
and the environment and

retreated into anesthetic vacu-‘

ums. Haynes’ camera-play
with what is inside and outside
creates visual metaphors for
Carol’s isolation from the
world and her fear of “real”
contact.

Whereas Kids’ sexuality

addresses an HlV-negative
audience, [Safe] is most likely
a didactic film for the H|V_-pos-
itive; life doesn’t end with HIV,
Haynes seems to say, unless
you want it to. Carol’s trip to
the New Age healing center is
healthy only if “health” is
defined as being alone, afraid
and uninvolved in life. Haynes
doesn’t want it" that way.
Carol’s less physically ill than
pathologically, and if you get
the movies’ point, you’ll step
outside the Playhouse and rel-
ish whatever stench may be in
the air.
Safe runs at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, Oak/and, through
October 12th. $5. Call 471-

The publication of the
Unabomber text has caused a
stir among technophiles, lud-
dites and others who are just
plain curious. For those who
have not read the text or aren't
sure what this is all about, a
brief analysis of “lndustrial
Society and its Future” is in
order.

Unlike other analyses, I will
try to stick to the text without

A any amateur psycho-analysis

of its author or authors. It is

, supposedly written by a group

called “FC," which stands for
“Freedom Club." They admit
the name is a little “inane,” but
have decided to stick with it for
continued name recognition.
The text does seem at points
to be a collaborative effort, but
I encourage anyone who is
truly curious to get onto the
Internet and look at it. For

WATER

those who are true luddites,
the library also has the copy
that was printed in The
Washington Post.

The text is 56 pages of diag-
nosis of today's societal prob-
lems. These are all traced
back to the technological base
of society. it is footnoted
throughout, and there are ref-
erences to other works, but
there are no statistics, graphs
or extensive citings of sources.
Most of the footnotes serve to
clarify points already within the
text.

When looking at the actual
text, the best place to start is
the “Final Note.” In the article,
FC admits that it in no way
states absolute truth. It reads:
“Throughout this article we’ve
made imprecise statements
and judgments that ought to
have all sorts of qualifications
and reservations attached to

them: and some of our state-
ment may be flatly false  And
of course in a discussion of
this kind one must rely heavily
on intuitive judgment, and that
can sometimes be wrong.”

Regardless of what their
beliefs are about the state of
society today, they ought to at
least have thought out what
their cause is before they kill
anyone in the name of it. In the
“Final Note,” FC also admits it
lacks sufficient information.
They have been bombing peo-
ple for 16 years, killing three
people and wounding 23 oth-
ers. They ought to be more
certain than their note sug-
gests.

With this “Final Note” in
mind, one can consider the
rest of the text in a meaningful
way. It is divided into three
basic arguments: 1) the indus-
trial society has deprived peo-
ple of their autonomy and left
them alienated; 2) people are
being molded into mere cogs
by the industrial society; 3) the
industrial society must be over-
thrown and not allowed to
reconstitute itself. _
According to the text, people

have a need to engage in what
they call the “power process.”
This consists of having a goal,
exerting effort to attain that
goal and the attainment of the
goal. There must be a regular
attainment of at least some
goals. The manifesto says that
any activities which, if a person
could not perform them if they
had to attend to survival, are
surrogate activities. These
include all science, which the
authors regard as evil because
it increases the ability of tech-
nological society to deprive
people of their autonomy. FC
wants us all to be primarily
concerned with survival.

The idea that people are
deprived of their sense of self-
sufficiency is a problem in
society. Anyone who._has
worked in a large corporation
at the bottom or has fought
any bureaucracy has probably
had this feeling. Low voter
turnout because the vote
seems meaningless is another
manifestation of this. The criti-
cism that we face hazards
because of other people’s
decisions is also true. These

society, a society that the
Unabomber feels ought to be
dismantled.

Whether people are being
molded into cogs for the indus-
trial society is a matter of some
debate. However, the
Unabomber manifesto is not
the first to suggest that the
only real requirement for many
people to get along these days
is obedience. People are sub-
ject to manipulation by the
media, corporations and the
government. The question is:
are people able to recognize
and deal effectively with the
manipulation?

Finally, the text calls for rev-
olution against industrial soci-
ety. it is written almost as a
handbook for others who share
the beliefs. It discusses
spreading the messages of the
text and developing a core of
“rational” individuals to convert
the masses. There is no clear
vision of the ends, but rather
vague references to a back-to-
the-land, post-industrial utopia.
The text admits there is no
way to predict the outcome of
any revolution, and this may
be why there is no clear pic-
ture of the ends to be attained.
Regardless, as the text itself

‘ points out, there must be a

goal. FC thinks that people

need to set goals, yet it has set

none for itself.

“lndustrial Society and its
Future” is an example of peo-
ple afraid of technology. We
can choose to master technol-
ogy or to let it master us. What
the question really comes
down to is whether people can
find the means to self-determi-
nation or choose to go along
with the flow. Some of the criti-
cisms are valid, but people
need to be woken up and not
blown up.

I was talking to the iisiHi'éiiJEé
editors who live inside my
head the other day about ways
to increase readership of my
column. The miniature angel
editor materialized on my left
shoulder and said, “John, you
should write about an impor-
tant social issue that today’s
college students should be
interested in. You can use
your column to educate them.
For instance, have you consid-
ered the plight faced by
Afghan fishermen as interna-
tional disputes now limit their
ability to make their livings?" _

Then the little devil editor‘

appeared on my right shoul-
der. He whispered two words
into my ear: “Sex sells.” So,

. without further ado, I present

to you, my dear friends and
readers, the first annual
(unless yinz like it a whole
bunch and want it more often)
sex-themed edition of zine
scene. I hope you’re all very,
very happy with what you’ve
reduced me to.

Post Modern Sluts #3 is a
very personal, feminist-orient-
ed zine by a couple of local
Goth girls. I get the feeling this
zine becomes more interesting

' in inverse relation to how well

you know the writers. l occa-
sionally felt like there was
something that I should have

been told when I was reading ’

it. But nonetheless, there is a
lot of writing packed into this
zine. Almost everything is writ-
ten in rant form, which is fast
becoming the communication
form of choice for the nineties.
There’s a really interesting one
about the wonderbra (or
maybe I just think its interest-
ing because I’m obsessed with
the wonderbra), as well as
ones about monogamy and
gender roles and being ogled
in public. A friend of mine
characterized this zine as
being kind of riot grrrlish in its
politics, but most of the rants
go a lot deeper than the kind
of knee-jerk reactionism that
some people associate with
the riot grrrl movement. These
women are writing from expe-

rience, not from what they’ve’

been taught at some women’s
meeting. Also, this zine seems
very much Goth cu|ture( espe-
cially in the artwork, which
depicts a lot of women with
big, black, scary hair), and
Goth and riot grrrl just don’t
mix. For a copy, send $2 to:
P.O. Box 81523, Pittsburgh,
PA 15217. lt’s also available at
Slacker on the South Side.
Subliminal Virginity #2 is a
zine put out by Dave
Matthews, whom you may
remember from the personal
ad-style fliers with which he’s
plastered this town. ln case
you haven’t seen them, they
go something like this: whiny,
hopelessly middle class, over-
ly intellectual white guy who
deludes himself into thinking
that he’s rebellious isn’t gettin’
any and wants some. Now, I
have occasionally considered

 

taking out a personals ad, but
never in my weakest moment
would I resort to copying a
bunch of fliers and putting
them up all over town. If Dave
would have put half the work
into Subliminal, Virginity that
he must have put into putting

nation as to why he did the
zine? About the only thing that
I can see in this zine that is
original is a reader survey
about (suprise, suprise) sex. If
by chance you want a copy of
this, it’s available at Slacker, or
by mail for $2 from: Dave
Matthews, P.O.'Box 23483,

these stupid fliers up, then it
could have been an interesting
zine. Instead we are treated to
reprinted articles from sources
like Ann Landers and The
Village Voice. The subject of
these reprinted articles is
always virginity and how it’s
okay now. Mr. Matthews
seems to be taking a sarcastic
attitude towards the articles,

but it is tough to tell, because Joln Us Sunday  8
he doesn’t really do anything

besides reprint them. Now, I at
