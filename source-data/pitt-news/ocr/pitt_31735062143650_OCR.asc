Monday

Dr. Alfred E. \Vo1f, associate

professor of zoology, gave a lec-
ture at the regular bi—1nonthly
forum of the freshman class of
the School of Pharmacy Monday
afternoon.
- His topic was: “The Physiology
and (lhemistry Involved in Mus-
cular Exercise.” Dr. Wolf pointed
out the great strides made in this
ﬁeld in the last seven years, in
that one of the accepted theories
of Z\leyerh0ff and Hill, expounded
in 1326, was blasted by a, German
physiologist in 1930. ‘

.\leyerhoif and Hill received the
i Nobel prize in 1926 for their re-
-’ search in physiology, but.‘ their
1 work was soniewhat upset by the
i new ﬁndings of a German phys-
iologist. Dr, Vvolf said that re-
gardless of the present knowledge
in this ﬁeld. a great deal more
may be found out about this fas-
cinatin:.: subject.

Said to be the outstanding scien-
tific development in this ﬁeld since the
c1‘o.a.ti.ur.L..Qf ,.v.is'.l. kid..,the _j,1‘e;v..process
makes a marked departure from the
usual treatment by impregnating the
raw hide with an entirely new combi-
nation of materials. Upon going into
hiding, the materials support and lu-
bricate the skin ﬁbers, thus prevent-
ing their breaking down under wear.
Since this is the cause of most leath-
ers losing their shape, it is expected
that this one will keep the shoes in
good shape. '

is the subject of a lecture to be given
by Dr. Walter Rautenstrauch, of Co-

the Carnegie Lecture Hall, under the
auspices of the League for Social Jus-

Dr. Rautenstrauch is well known as
the repudiator of much of Howard
Scott's technocracy publicity. Later,
however, Rautenstrauch admitted that
he did this because of “misunder-
standing and confusion,” and, at
present, he is working in conjunction
with Columbia University “to con-
tinue the researches and investiga-
tions under a new organization and a.
new name.” It is expected that he

“While technocracy has recently
disappeared from the front pages of
our newspapers, the problems it raised
and attempted to answer are by no
means settled and will certainly have
to be coped with by the ‘new era’ be-
fore we can hope for a real recovery
from our present economic ills. Dr.
Rautenstauch will present the scien-
tiﬁc point of view from which it must
first be dealt.” This is according to
the League, itself.

types of the dance: the dagger dance

pressionistic gymnastics. In the old
story. “Sleeping Beauty,” the dancers
will pose as ﬁgures in a frieze work.

Since the purpose of the Dance

the dance need not be worked out, but
the idea must be origin:-.1. Under the
tutelage of Mrs. Tracy. creations of

New York I‘Vriter Speaks
On War Probability Today

 

“Proba.bilit.y of W'ar" is to be dis-
cussed by Marcell Scherrer, cheniical
engineer from New York, at an open
forum of the Student League for So-
cial Justice at one o'clock today in
room 107 Alumni Hall. Discussion
will be centered particularly about
the present danger of war in Europe
and the Far East.

Mr. Scherrer, graduate of Colgate
University, has long been known in

social, industrial, and political circles ,

as possessing a keen mind. Hels a
lecturer of note and a writer of wide
experience, having contributed freely
to the “New Masses" and other social
organs.

It is probable that the newly organ-
ized studeiit anti-war committee will
make tentative plans and discuss pro-
jects for the future lnimediately fol-
lowing the meeting. A large meeting
is anticipated by members of the
League “because the present world
affairs have
stimulated recent interest on the part
of the students in the question to be
discussed."

Pitt Bits

It seems as though the stadium ath-
letic officials do not trust the chubby
rascals who try out for the purpose of
representing Alma Mater. The ath-
letic equipment has been missing at
such a rate that everything is being
stamped PITT. Even down to the
socks.

The purpose is to make the
training clothes and other arti-
cles so conspicuous that no one
will want them, Oh Yeah.

It's all over but the shouting now.
After 200 bizad students had W3-flied
up . prayers that Champ Tiernan
would be defeated in a Wrestling
match, the big boy goes and throws
a heavier opponent in less than two
minutes.

And unless the stories of the
unamp's prowess are discontin-
ued, he will ‘become another
legend. Like Paul Bunyan, or
the missing Cap and Gown so-
prano.

The boxing coaches who kept score
cards of the title bouts at the recent
Conference championships held in
‘Morgantown were unanimous in their
opinion that Jimmy C-iannatti had
won the title from ‘West Virginia's
Bill Neely.

T

After narrowly beating the Alpha.
Phi Delta ﬁve 26-2-0 Vvednesday night
at the Stadium pavilion, Phi Delta
Theta was officially awarded the
championship cup in the Interfrater-
nity basketball league. The runners-
up were also presented a cup by In-
terfraternity Council as was Delta
Tau Delta, which defeated Omega
Delta in the preliminary game.

Heckler led in scoring for the
league champs by cashing 3 ﬁeld
goals and 3 fouls for 9 points. Odell
and YVhite, also of the winning team,
netted 6 points each. For the Alpha
Phi Delts, Adonizio was the main
scoring threat with 6 points to his
credit.

The Phi Delt team was trailing by
3 points at the end of the ﬁ1'Sl; quar-
ter, 9-6, but jumped ahead to lead at
the half, 14-11. It maintained its lead

lfrom then on although the Alpha Phi

Delta team was within two points of

The two judges and the ref-
eree evidently didn’t think so as
all three voted for ‘Neely.

And in case anyone is really inter-
(‘!.-‘.l.l;'(l, here's a. tip on how to enjoy
yourself in lllprgantown. Go to the
Cosmopolitan Lunch (no ad‘) on the
main street and see the best looking
sister waitress team in the town.

Undefeated teams seem to be
the rage with Pitt freshman ath-
letes this year. The footballers
started it. and the basketball and
swimming teams continued the
streak. Which goes to show why
coaches of varsity teams smile.
Heavyweight boxers will likely be

on the collegiate cards next year. and
the result will be a new beef trust.
Football players will dominate, it is
hoped, but as is usually the case, the
footballers who act the toughest are
the ones who won't try out-for the
team.

The All—American Girl story
seems to have grown somewhat,
and latest reports have at least
five girls out for the honor. The
original brunette holds the lead,
according to latest flashes from
the battle front.

If weight alone means anything,
John Valenti will be the greatest
football player on the squad. Valenti,
who may hold down the center posi-
tion this year, weighed in for spring
practice at a mere 250 pounds. (Yes,
we were there).

And a few of the boys who
made the papers by announcing
their engagements were behind
the times. At least three of the
better known players were al-
ready married when the epidemic
of announcements arrived.

And to close, one of those married
was the proud father of a. seven-
months-old son.

ment in the state of Pennsylvania.

the last quarter. In the dying min-

ahead 22-20 with the rival Greek ag-
gregation in possession of the ball,
but a lightning play gave it to Odell
who scored, followed immediately by
White, clinching the game.

Omega Delts did not score until well
into the second quarter when ‘Whita-
ker cashed a sleeper. The Delta Tau
Deltas meanwhile had amassed 14
points.

In this game, Hartwig of the Delts
was the high scorer and also the main
ﬂoor menace. His total ran up to 19
points, including 9 baskets and 1 foul.
Next in"1ine was Greene, also of the
Delts, who gathered 8 markers. For
the losers, Anderson stood out having

Milk Maids, Rustic Dancing, Horses and Bandanas Feat-
ure Program in WAA’s Ye Olde Hicke Taverne

 

Amid blinking oil-lamps, bushel
baskets of shining apples and dusty
potatoes, and glistening milk-cans,
Pitt coeds enjoyed the rustic hospi-
tality of \VAA’s Ye Olde Hicke
Ta.verne, last Vifednesday evening.

Overalled waitresses started the
evening's entertainment with a. real
bucolic supper served to cosy four-
somes seated about card tables spread
with red or green checked-~>ta;bIecloths.
Boston baked beans, Boston brown-
bread sandwiches, cole slaw, potato
chips, topped off with hot Dutch apple
pie and steaming coffee were served.
During the meal, the patrons of Ye
Olde Hicke Taverne received large
red and blue handkerchiefs; between
courses they danced to the modern
rhythms of “Sunny" Sunderland's
orchestra in the dim light of the barn.

The high spot of the program was

the farm entertainment. With vigor-
our knee-slappings and a farmer's
drawl, farmer boy Betty Quarrie in-
troduced the entertainers, A novelty
was a square dance executed by
farmer boys and milk maids, the boys
in straw hats and overalls, the milk
maids in checked gingham dresses re-
vealing ruffled pantaloons. Another
was an intelligent horse, Napoleon,
whose feet refused to work together,
but who could pick out the notables
present.

Best of all was the return of Hilda
Rubin and Adelaide Hunter, old WAA
cabaret performers. Proving that old
grads are much better than they used
to be, Hilda as the boy and Adelaide
as the girl gave a complete resume of
their four former programs, ending
with the melancholy singing of “The
old college grads, they ain't what they
usta. be."

“Steps. How many steps did you
count?”

“Steps? No. no, you got us all
wrong! Not steps, stiffs. How many
stilts, cadavers, corpses, bodies. slab-
riders, human remains, STIFFS—-—in
other words, dead persons —- how
many of them have you got in this
place anyhow?"

“WHAT! Stiffs? I thought you
sa.id steps! Listen, buddies, if you
wanna know how many of them
things they be up there, you go up
and count ’em your own selfs. I ain't
scared. mind you, but I just ain't
never had no cause to count ‘em be-
fore, and I ain't feelin’ a helluva lot
like doin‘ it at 1:30 this mornin'.
Here's the keys; go up to the fourth
floor and look around. They ain't no
lights up there now, but, here, use
this.”

’l‘o be frank, the two boys didn't
“feel a helluva lot like it." them-
selves, but “duty was duty, a vow» was
a vow, so let’s boost our courage and
count them-—and how!” So, with
their fiaunting silk bow ties ﬂapping
in the wind, and their hearts beating
in far from waltz tempo. the two went
to their task with a. will for dear old
alma frater; with their dim ﬂashlight
picking out here a. stiff, there a stiff,
everywhere a “dear deceased," they
ﬁnally counted twelve, and scooted
out to a third pal.

They've already been paddled plen-
ty. and invested with the handshake
and the password, so now the re
vealed fact that the three were to-
gether that harrowing night and
morning instead of wending their sep-
arate ways can no longer hurt them.

The third chap wasn’t physically up
to taking a squint at the corpses. He
was resting up in the car in prepara-
tion for scouring the Hill district for
an angora cat that was expecting live
or ten “blessed events." He found
one.

Clarifying the Question

THE impori..a.n.t part of the diploma question has been settled.
There can be no misinterpretatioii placed upon the action taken
by the University this week in calling for a new and complete ex-
pression of senior preference on the two shcepskm forms under
consideration. _ _

Accompanying the announcement of a second poll and the mail-
ing of cards to all seniors was a plain statement of the U_niversit_v’s
position on the matter of selection. The cards sent out this week by -
Registrar Quick state clearly: _

“The old wall-typo diploma will be continued unless there 1S a.
clear majority of the total undergraduate senior class in favor of
1.11 e book-typo diploma. ’ ’

These few words remove one of the causes of student dissatisfac-
tion with the original poll. The fact that they had no deﬁnite un-
derstanding as to the power of their preference in shaping the ﬁnal.
decision may have been responsible for the negative opinion regis-
1.ercd by College and Education seniors against the book-type
diploma. This, at any 1'a.tc, appeared to be the main reason under-
lying Student Council’s action in protesting the first poll last week.

The University’s willingness to discard the results of the first
vote, and the fact that it tried to get an expression from the senior
class of its own accord, indicates its desire to have a.ny cliaiiges meet
with the approval of the sudcnts conccrncd. Certainly, there is no
reason immediately apparent why the University should champion
either a change or retention. of the present diploma.

The eventual choice, after all, matters ].iti.lc. It is probable that
student opinion will be pretty evenly divided. Regardless oi’. the
vote, this division will be true of the argiiinenis for each type: one
side sounds as convincing as the other. It is simply a case of pleas-
ing the greater number.

Any .t'11ri:.licr iiianifcsitations of discontent will be 011.1; of order.
It remains only for the seniors themselves to give a genuine response.

The Alumnus Organizes

ORGANIZATION has at last. reached the unemployed college grad-
uate. It is a. chcerless but yet courageous message that is sound-
ed for the Great American. Class of ’33 by none less than John
Dewey, godfather and guiding spirit of the recently organized As-
sociation of Unemployed College Alumni.

O.rga.nizat.ion and agitat.ion——tliat is the two-fold purpose cher-
ished by this band of jobless college alumni. Trained for the pro-
fessions, they have found themselves graduated into a world that
has evidenced little need for their services as engineers, librarians,
teachers, doctors, lawyers and architects. And so they decided to
do something about it.

Organization——again that magic word——naturally came first. To-
day thc association is telling the world it has soincthing. like twenty
chapters and a few hundred members throughout the coun‘try. The
“agitation” is yet to come. “When we have 10,000 members or-
ganized, articulate,”~ they say, “we can force action.” The- action
referred to is described as an attempt to inﬂuence social legislation,
to win industrialists over to a program of planned indiistry, with
the beneﬁts of unemployment insurance, and to -force the govern-
ment to provide work, rather than charity.

In addition to John Dewey, the unique depression-bred associa-
tion has two other prominent thinkers on its National Advisory
Council, They are Morris Raphael Cohen and Reinhold Niebulir,
both of whom have spoken before and consulted with student groups
on our own University campus within the last year.

“College graduates,” says Dr. Dewey in an “-open letter” to
the class of ’33, “are the most pitiful group of workers in this crisis
. . . U-ncmplbyinent has caught them all unorganized and with no
technique for combating the organized agencies of retrenchment.”
Following. this statement of his followers’ inadequacies, the noted
philosopher concludes his message with a plea for the college
alumnus not to neglect “associations that might give him effective
bargaining power.”

“Association of Unemployed College Ali1mni"——hea_ring it for
the ﬁrst time, one hardly knows whether to laugh or to cheer. Can
it be true that the silent-suffering professional man is to forego the
dignity of his training a.nd actually begin thinking objectively, in-._
terms of cause and effect, bread and butter? It appears to be so.
The proof lies in the earnest statement of the sponsor, in the very
force of his argument.

Organization has been the salvation of the skilled and unskilled
laborer. It has given the wage-earner a bargaining power of im-
ineasurable value. Perhaps it ma.y be able to do something for the
college man.

And What of Poetry?

“Te hear again and again these
days that the poetic impulse i'n mod-
ern civilization is spent. and that we
shall have no more great: poetry. The
idea is not peculiar to our time. Lord
Macauley in the nineteentli century,
saw poetry, as an expression and sat-
isfaction of liumankiiid, dwindling
propo1'tiona.teI;.' as our culture grew
more complex. Peacock in his Four
Ages of Poetry could trace in poetry
a constant discouraging decline from
early times to the preseiit. To both
men poetry lay richest close to the
primitive mind. But the world is full
of strange paradoxes.‘ What a tech-
nique of logic can prove almost con-
clusively, the emotions 1'efut.e. _So
that while Peacock was» ow-riting his
discourse, others in England and on
the cfontinent were creating some of
the ﬁnest poetry we possess; and the
Romantic wave in all ﬁelds of life,
from literature, art, and politics
down, had roused Europe to a clear-
er and deeper uiiderstaiicliiig of the
worth of man and of the poetic spirit
in life.

‘We oiigiit to ponder, then, before
we accept any pessimistic view of
poetry. Not that there is not great

hundred more reasons to buttress his
argiiineiitsz; the confusion. in every
angle of life, values gone with noth-
ing to replace them except erratic ac-
tivity, the noble conception of the in-
dividual fast vanishing, the healtliy
inﬂuences of nature giving place to
city life, where squalor, poverty,
ignorance, swayed by unscrupulous
iiiﬂiience, rubs elbows with sophisti-
cation, great riches, education, and
the l'il_8‘ll8St contribiitioiis of scientiﬁc
civilization; wiiere the old moulds

_,Editor Urges Students to

Start Movements

Dr. Mary E. Woolley, president of
Mount Holyoke College, and delegate
of the United States to the World’s
Disarmament Conference at Geneva,
will speak at the Hotel Schenley, next
Thursday evening, on “The Cause and
Cure of War.” A short reception and
a formal dinner will precede the
speech.

The movement for the cause and
cure of war was founded by Carrie
Chapman Catt in 1920. Since that
time almost all of the active women's
organizations in the country have
Joined the movement.

Viewing the W’orld Christian ‘Stu-
dent iM~ovement as an instrument for
bringing together Christian students
of the world a.n-d thereby promoting
international peace and understand-
ing, Dr, W. A. Visser ’t Hooft, secre-
tary of the VVor1d’s Christian Student
Federation and editor of “The "Student
VVO1-Id,” spoke to YW and YMCA
members at the Schenley Hotel last
Monday afternoon.

“For the past decade we have
thought that education and increas-
ing communication between coun-
tries would make youth internation-
ally minded,” began D1‘. ’t Hooft, “but
today the people who are in a dead-
lock over the disarmament question
and other difficulties are the educat-
ed leaders who know most about
other countries." 1

“Intcri1a.tionalism has not the di-
rect appeal or emotional appeal of
nationalism, which has in its favor
history, a common language, culture,
symbols, and a. national leader. In
Germany severity or eighty per cent
of the students a1'e Hitlerites, while
only about ﬁt‘-ty percent of the total
population belong to that party.
While natioiialism makes the nation
an idol. Communism has the class as
its idol. The W'or1d Christian Move-
ment adds a. common loyalty which
will hold students together in spite
of racial, language, and national dif-
ferences.”

Imagina.tio11——i:he quality of synthc-§
sis, of iiisig11t~—11as the power of dc-;
teciing ultimate values, and of seciixgi
life as a just re1a.tioi1ship of parts to
one another and to a conceived whole.
And imagination and poetry are born;
of the same breath. Imagination is;
to poetry what tiie motive is to the;
act, what the wind is to the riistliiigg
music of the leaves. VVhereve1' this}
quality of insight appears men are go- 3
ing to act on its impulses. Almost.‘
the only place we ﬁnd it today is in;
the ﬁeld of science, and there onlyi
by a few who are capable of seeing».
the entire scientiﬁc system as 
whole. There is little iniaginatioii inf
any branch that runs too deep into;
specialization to communicate withé
others. But Wllei'e_ll_J.Slg‘llt is needed
most is in understanding ourse1ves.3
The outside world works confusion;
inward; we lack all sense of personal 3
harmony, balanced ego, soul, call it’
what you will. In this needapoetry
can be of inestimable service, ,

For the poetic experience is the;
precise state in which our feelings;
beliefs. conditions, and actions are:
aligned for the moment into-perfect’
relationship. in which. as through a
kind of exalted liypnotism. all-=-0.111‘ in-
terests are brought to a focal’=point,;
line on line, and we see things, not as
they are but as they most siuiely
oiight to be.--»~~Im~aginat~iou,—insight, is.
after all. seeing things as they should
exist. We have all the materials for
a splendid civilization, a. technique
for living that surpasses anything yet
evolved. But we need to know how
to use it. We need, ﬁrst of all, to,
know ourselves and to order our ownf
natures. If we are to progress at 3.11.3
this will have . to. be accomplished’
through imagination. He who values
imagination sbouldiinot disdain the
virtues of poetry which, along with:
the other arts, stands highest in its
power to harmonize the interests and
motives of the l1l11‘I18_11" personality.

Industrial Decline

Is Pointed Out
By Bureau

The Bureau of Business Ro-
sezircli of the University compiled
and presented to the care—worricd
business men of the City of Pitts-
burgh last week, a table of busi-
ness indexes, showing the be-
wildered industrialists just how
much immediate danger there is

of pretty prosperity falling
around the corner.
In comparing the indexes of

trade and production in the Steel
City, the Bureau statisticians
divided production into four
parts: iron and steel, electric
power, coal, and rail shipments.
Tiicse major phases of local in-
dustry they compared with the
week ending l\ia,1‘cl1 11, 1933, and
the co1'1'csponding week of last
year.

And so the hopeful slioplzeepers
can toss in bed at night over this.
Production. in total dropped. (in
index) from 49 per cent to less
than 36 per cent. Iron and steel
declined like a ﬁat tire from last
year's 34.7 to the present 21.5.
Electric power took it; on the chin
from over 70 to a little more than
58. Lil-:e-wise, the-production of
coal wilted from over 67 to a do-
ﬁatzed. 54-, Rail shipments fell
from 51 to 34.
