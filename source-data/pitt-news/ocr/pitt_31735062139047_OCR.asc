ments were designated by large white
banners, and like a suffragette parade
they marched single ﬁle down Forbes.
Torches of red ﬁre were provided for
the students as they passed Craft ave-
nue, and a brilliant scene it was. One
long serpentine line of swaying lights,

each rythmically swinging keeping
time to the dear old Alma
.Mater. The band led the procession

th.rough the streets of Oakland to the
tune of “Hail, Hail, the Gang’s All
Here,” “Pittsburgh University,” etc.
Between the selections the boys
marched in wierd single ﬁle, a mam-
moth green lid carried on a litter in

New Officers

In one of the most hotly contested
elections ever conducted by the alum-
ni, A. R. Hamilton was elected presi-
dent. The largest vote ever polled at
an election of the Alumni Association
was registered at the election closed
last Monday evening. The complex
ballot, due to the large number of
nominations, together with ‘the large
vote, were responsible for a delay of
over three hours in securing the elec-

THE PITT

WEEKLY .

. §mREo'ro'R MILLER

SPEAKS IN CHAPEL

 

i=D_iscusses Fencing and Baseball Pros-

pects.

'. Mr. Miller, Director of Athletics,
made a speech at the weekly convoca-

"tion in which he outlined some plans

for new activities in the sporting line
at Pitt. He spoke of the great op-
portunity the University had of put-
ting a strong fencing team in the
ﬁeld, and of the new interdepartment
-baseball league to be formed in the
spring. He said in part:

“There is a splendid chance for the
University to put a fencing team in
the ﬁeld and to ‘have a team in the
intercollegiate league next year. There
is a vacancy in the league and if the
University can put a good team in
the ﬁeld there is every reason to be-
lieve that the University can ﬁll this
vacancy. The intercollegate contests
are ‘held in the Astor hotel in New
York City, thus affording the team a
ﬁne trip. In add-ition to this the Uni-
versity-team would go east to meet
some eastern college in a dual meet
and one eastern college would come

V T to Pitt for a like contest.‘ Mr.  W.
Postgate has kindly offered his serv-l
 ices as coach, in case a sufﬁcient num-'
= ber of students turn out f-or the team.

He is one of the best fencing masters
in the -country. I wish that all stu-

dents’ interested in this matter would ‘

hand in their names to me as soon as
they can. 

“It is the intention of the Universi-
ty to have an interdepartment base-
ball league this spring, and in order to
get-something deﬁnite started along

' this line, it is desired to have the vari-

ous departments elect baseball man-
agers as soon as possible. As soon as
the managers are elected there will be
a meeting of the managers to arrange

I "he'll. a deﬁnite schedule for the league.

Mr. Mellor and B. F. Ashe made

iishort speeches about the program for

anniversary week.

Mr. Harvey made a very short
speech on the student building situa-
tion’, expressing the opinion that there
would be no use to do anything on the

‘ fund until after the celebration. Then

active work would be taken up in

CO-EDS HOLD GIRLS’ DANCE.

 

Girls Only Attend Dance in Honor of
Anniversary.

An informal dance was held by some
of the co-eds on last Monday evening.
This dance was strictly “a la co—cd;"
that is, the co-eds danced with the
co-eds and the co-eds only. The gen-
tlemen gazed from afar, but were not
permitted to dance with the fair co-
eds, even though it so happened that a
masculine orchestra furnished the
music. The whole trouble started
thusly: I p ’

The co-eds had gathered about to
see part of the student‘ demonstration
on the ‘hillside overlooking the Uni-
versity, and the music of thefb-and
having‘ put the ladies in a frame of
mind to dance, they persuaded some
of the mandolin club members to
play for them. The leaders of the
grand’ march could not be obtained
for publication, but it is said to have
been one of the most beautiful grand
marches ever held in the City of
Pittsburgh. All voted the co-eds cel-
ebration to be a great success and a’
distinctive feature of the anniversarv
celebration.

}Large Crowd of Enthusiastic “grads”
? Attend Annual Meeting of

l Alumni Association.

, At the annual meeting of the Alum-
,_ni Association the largest number of
ithe alumni ever present at any meet-
ling of this association attended. The
ifwhole meeting was marked by the
‘most enthusiastic discussions upon
the future of the University and inci-
ldentally the Alumni Association.
 A lively argument took place upon
lthe manner of alumni elections. Ac-
;cording to several members of the As-
l‘sociation the number of men nom-
iinated was so large‘ that it was almost
}impossible to mark. the-ballot. Several
imethods were suggested by which this
difﬁculty might be avoided. The asso-
ciation ﬁnally voted to refer the ques-
tion to a committee of the Alumni
Council with instructions to prepare
an amendment to the by-laws to meet
‘the difﬁculty.
« The proposal was made that the Pitt
Weekly be sent to members. of the
Alumni not members of the Associa-
tion. The question was referred to a
committee to be appointed by the
president of the association. Pro-
fessors Friesell, Asihibrook, Fickes
.'Has1ett and Hertig were elected mem-
bers of the association.‘ A resolution
was passed instructing the publication
of the election results in the Pitt
EV/eekly.

in those lands. In connection w-ith
these lectures, Mr. Chowey, the presi-
dent of the club, was asked to give. a

WIVLSON ADDRESSES
. I JOURNALISM CLASS

 

Erasmus Wilson, the “Quiet Ob-
server” of the Pittsburgh Gazette-

Times, spoke to the Journalism Class"

of the Evening School last Monday
evening on “Newspaper Ethics.”

Mr. Wilson sketched the life of the
American newspaper from the time of
Horace Gree1ey’s New York Tribune,
whensome people were under" the im-
pression that Greeley wrote every
word in his paper, e-venﬂdown to the
-ads, t'hrough the style of newspaper
when sharp editorial attacks were the
policy. Following this came the awak-
ening of the business department, who
forced the editors to modify the news
to suit the advertiser, and on down
through yellow journalism and down
to our present day method of getting
the facts in a plain manner.

Mr. Wilson summed up newspaper
ethics in these words: “Do unto others
as you would have others do unto
you,” and “always see the -other man’s
viewpoint and act fair.”

Mr. Wilson enlivened his talk-by
numerous anecdotes for which he is
famous.

Mr. Schultz, general manager of the
Post and Sun, will speak next Monday
on “Newspaper Management.”

CELEBRATIOi,N.= '

The University of Pittsburgh cele-
brates this week the one hundred and
twenty-ﬁfthanniversary of its birth as
an educational institution in thi_s city.
Two years before"-the time when the
United States adopted its constitution
the Universityof Pittsburgh opened
its doors to the ‘public. From that
time, on, the growth of the present
University has been steady and strong.
Its chief aim -has been to'offer to the
residents, of Pittsburgh, an educa-
tional institution which would be ade-
quate to meet their every demand.

Since those early days when the
University was in its childhood, great
changes have been made both in the
city and in the school. The number
of people then living in the district
now known as Pittsburgh has grown
from a nucleus of a few scattered fam-
ilies, .to an immense municipality, of
approximately one million souls; like-
wise, the University, starting with one
small building and a mere handful of
students, has grown into a ﬁrst class
school, having an immense campus
covering many acres in the very best

A part of the city. Again the small num-

ber of courses at ﬁrst given in the Uni-
versity has increased so that now the
perspective student can choose be-
tween eleven distinct schools.

But the real work of the University’

has_ onlyestart-ed; the splendid begin-
ning is but a token of what is to. fol-
low. As Pittsburgh is still rapidly
growing and Promoting Progress, the
Univers-ity must continue to meet the
ever increasing demands placed upon
it to develop men capable to meet the
demands of the future.

Let every loyal student of Pitt join
in the celebration of his Alma Mater.
Let every student consecrate himself
anew to the duties he owes to his
University, and let each.student re-
solve that he will do everythingein
his power to build up old “Uni.” until
s.he assumes her proper place—one of
the greatest of the world powers in
the ﬁeld of education.

LOYAL FRESHMEN.

The success of any school depends
upon the loyalty of its student body.
With a Freshman class such as ours
certainly the University of Pittsburgh
will rapidly advance during the next
few years. Any body of men who
will wade through deep mud, carry
boxes, lumber and barrels in pouring
rain for a whole afternoon in ‘order
to make their part of a great celebra-

of the highest praise. The work of

need not worry concerning the future
of the University of Pittsburgh.

TI-‘IE S‘TUDENT’S DUTIES.’

In the midst of a great celebration
such as the present, the student is
very apt to forget his duties. With
the many exciting events which excite
the mind and distract the attention
continually surrounding us, it will be
necessary for us to be on our guard
tha.t we may not fail in the perform-
ance of any of -our many duties dur-
ing this week. Aside from the larger
events of the week, such as the pro-
cessions today, the alumni banquet to-
night, the meetings tomorrow, the
musical concert tomorrow« evening
and other'i'mportan.t gatherings, the
stud-ent must endeavor to aid in other
ways." For instance, ‘let no student
permit any person who is .a guest of
the University of Pittsburgh leave
with the feeling that the -students in
this institution are lacking in the
slightest degre-e in the courtesy which
they show to visitors. Let each man
devote his energies to making every
guest perfectly comfortable. iThe
diligent watchfulness which marks
the conduc-t of our student body under‘
normal circumstances ‘must show
itself preeminently during this week.

--—-9

The interest taken in the studen-ts
by, the Alumni Association should
certainly receive the thanks of the en-
tire undergraduate body. At consider-
able cost to themselves the ailurnni
have a arranged that it is possibie for
every student to be present at the
banquet -this evening. That the stu-
dents have taken advantage of this
offer so eagerly is but the sign of its
popularity. The alum-ni have shown‘ a
most progressive spirit in their ar-
rangements with the students; one
which can not fail to bring the alumni
and student cl-oser in contact.

dent T‘h_wing’s speech was as follows:

“We are passing through a.poeti‘c
age, in an age of unrest, of changing

the college do to promote good citi-

the best it can. To see factsas they
are, trying to force the point that two

Weighing evidence is the use“ of
education. Social facts are hard to
determine their relations. Statistics
show that 15 of our 27 Presi-

our Vice Presidents were college men;

the larger portion of the cabinet mem-

‘‘But of the present and of the fu-
ture, the era of good citizens_hip,‘and

ADDITIONAL
SPORTING

 

\-

‘MASON WILL ASSIST

IN BASEBALL

Ralph S Davis, the sporting au-
thority of the Pittsburgh Press, says
-in his sporting column:

i‘Harris»on D. Mason, better known
athletically as ‘Joe’ Mason, _a former
Iroquois A. C. baseball .player of -the
North Side, and later captain and third
b-aseman of the Penn lSta-te College
nine, is located in Pittsburgh, with
the United States Bureau of Mines.

“His position leaves him free S-atur-
day afternoons, and he has offered his
services to Direct-or Charles S. Miller
in assisting to -coach the University of
Pittsburgh baseball candidates.

“A State man help Pitt. Well, why
not Mason is a Pittsburgih boy, and
believes in ‘Pittsburghers for Pitts-
burgh,’ even though his Love for alma
mater will never grow less.

“ My heart will always be with Penn
State,’ said Harry, in commenting on
his offer, ‘but, unable to help State in
any way, I want to do what I can for
Pitt. Two of my brothers, Dean and
Earle, captained W. U. P. baseball
nines in 1903 and 1904, and it will be
a matter of pride with me to see Pitt’s
baseball teams measure up to her
grand footb-all eleven-s. I am willing
to do what I can to help the good
work along, for it seems that it’s tough
sailing to get real baseball under way
at Pitt, although this year will un-
doubtedly see it established on a firm
basis, One of Pitt’s twirling candi-
dates, P. D. Pollock, Dental School, of
Charleroi, is a close friend of .mine,
and he claims that all they need is the
necessary coaching to develop an ex-

_remem»bere,d,

“The average athletic fan . th-inks
only of Pitt and State as bitter rivals
in every branch of spOrt,»a11d may find
it hard to imagine a ‘follower of one
institu-tion -helping the other. That
idea is entirely false. Athletics are
for a deﬁnite purpose, namely, the up-
building of the human body, and not
for the establishing of feuds or hatred
between the students ofirival institu-
tions.”

Direc-tor Miller very much
pleased to receive Mr. Masons’ offer
to assist in coaching the nine and fully
agrees with the Press expert that a
kindly feeling lies underitwhe bitter
rivalry shown on the athletic ﬁeld. In
announcing that “Tom” McCreery has
been selected as coach, Director Miller
stated that with such a man as Mason
to assist the team could not well be
otherwise than successful.

Ex-Pirate Pitcher and Outﬁelder Will
Take Reins of Varsity -— Heaviest

Late Tuesday afternoon, Director
Miller announced that hehad secured
the services of T. L. McCreery to

McCreery -pitched for
several years for the old Louisville
team, but joined the Pirate crew with
Fred Clarke and Hans Wagner and

was with Pittsburgh for about four

ing season.

years. He gained qu.ite a reputation

as a hurler, but Manager_ Clarke

switchedhim to the outfield as his-

heavy hitting made him valuable in

every ‘game. His old record made
when he played for Louisville is still
that in hitting for a
‘total of 13 bases in four times at bat.
The ﬁrst time he faced the pitcher he
cracked out‘: single and then poled
out three consecutive home runs
which put the game on ice for the
Kentuckians.

Coach McCreery is a college grad-
uate and since his retirement from the
strenuous diamond game has been
with +he American Sheet and Tin
Plate C0,, and will continue his posi-
tion there, giving his afternoons to
coaching. His plan is to start battery
practice immediately in the new gym
in order to get t-he men in shape for
the early opening onthe Stadium.
Director Miller has already ordered
the nets necessary for indoor base-
ball work and hopes to havethe gym-
nasium in shapeshortly.

The question of trainer has also
come up and the selection has narrow-
ed down to” two or three men. This

plauded. Following these came H. K.

peared. Among these were a number
of co-eds. Miss*Alma Boehrjg and
Miss Agnes Willis scored decided hits
in the presentation of their respective
parts. _

The tableaux, six in number, con-

formance. Those who took part. in
these are to becornmended for their
good work. , A

This play was a very ﬁtting. affair
for the first real evening of the anni-
versity. Mr. Seibel, of the Gazette-
Times, the author, -wrote the play in

blank verse and it showsa free‘ and-

easy style as well as the use ‘of a
very large vocabulary. Mr. Birdsall

THE PITT.

WEEKLY _-

  Mm box
"Dear Editor: In view of the ener-
getic manner in which the 1915 men
managed the torchlight parade and
cap-night exercises, I am taking the

liberty to ask you to permit me
through your columns to -praise the

' . Freshmen‘for'the-work. The -arrange-.
' ments for last Monday night were the

most thorough we have ever had. I
never saw an -affair of its kind more
AFr—om beginning to end
ther-e was not the least hitdh. The
men in charge should certainly be
congratulated. I heard from other
persons that a large number of the
Freshmen carried boxes, barrels and
lumber‘ for the bonﬁre in a pouring
rain. ,They .are showing the right

. kind of spirit. They are making good.

I_trust that future classes will follow
the precedent set by this progressive
class. Yours for Pitt,

 An “Old Grad.”

Well," well,.here we are one hundred
and "twenty-ﬁve years old! Sure as
you live the big week has arrived in
the history of the University. Con-
gratulations, congratulations, heaps
and heaps of ’em. Just think ofit, a
century and a quarter of «existence!

Seems to .me, that the United States
of America was officially launched in
the year 1787 with-a ﬁrst.-class‘ consti-

; — tution, and since «that, time has ex-

panded considerably. —. Old Uni-vhas not
expanded so extensively, but we feel
equally as big as" ninety. millions of

r

' ‘people three times .over.

.onward an d’ upward.

It"s‘a sure
thing we couldn’t,get along without
Uncle Sam’s farrn,.and its doubly cer-
tain the United States will be unable
to exist without us before many more
years slip past. ‘

But I am skipping away’ ahead of
my story! H i

The first thing I wanted to do was
the extension of greetings t-o our vis-
itors. There are so many; all so
noted; all so famous, that I am not
-going to single out individuals or in-
stitutions. So, here we go all at once
-——a huge handshake and a vociferous»
welcome to Pittsburgh and her great
University! All the keys; all the se-
crets tothe inner recessesof the Uni-
versity belong‘ to'the delegates, who
honor us with their presence this
week. I

It is a wonderful privilege; a splen-
did opportunity to greet men ofsuch
pre—eminent ability, who bear the best
wishes of sister institutions over the
broad expanse of the nation.

* * * * *

What does_ thisnatal day mean to
the students? Itilluminates the'fu-
ture with hopes so immense, so vast
thatthe past is faded into insigniﬁc-
ance. We rejoice that the career of
the University has extended through
these years. We applaud the perse-
verance of thosewho have gone be-
fore. ~All this, and more, we at-tribute
to the pioneers, who have laid the
foundationof the greater Pittslburgh.

But the student of to-day is en-
t'hused with the -pros-pects of the- days
to‘-come. We are going to convert
the barren hillside into a- temple of
learning that knows no rival; that rec-
ognizes no-su-perior. Pittsburgh will
represent the acme of culture, of re-
ﬁnement and of .attainment!

The spirit of progress is sweeping
Buildings; are
coming; strength and reputation are
increasing.

The -glow and ardor of enthusiasm
is bound to bring results. That is the
reason we hurl ourselves into celebra-
tion;' that accounts.for'the jubilant
tone of the sons and daughters of
Pittsburgh this week.
III II! * * *'

When we sing the praises of the
venerable men who have contributed
their lives and services in the decades
long gone by, let us not forget the
master builder of the »present—Chan-
cellor McCormick. It is ‘he, who is
standing at the helm. It is he who is
the dynamo of Pittsburgh energy.
Three times three for the Chancellors

‘and louder rose the din of drum and

boys marched‘ up the boulevard to the
campus, ‘then up the winding road to

and the whole body scattered like so

DR. HOLDSWORTH SPEAKS.

 

Dean of Economic School Lectures on
“The Evolution of the Savings Bank
and the Trust Company”
Bankers’ Association.

 

Dr. J. T. Holdsworth, dean of the
School of Economics, lectured in Jen-
kins Arcade hall last Tuesday evening
before the members of the Pittsburgh
Chapter of the American Institute of
Banking. He chose as his subject
“The Evolution of the Savings Bank
and the Trust Company.” ‘His speech
was largely a history of the savings
bank. Dr. Holdsworth declared that
the system of banking is in a state of
evolution and will soon in the future
be operated by an entirely new set of
machinery. He also said that the
thrift and economy of depositors
which is as beneﬁcial -to society as to
the depositors themselves, is the back-
bone of modern economic organiza-
tion. ’ ' ‘

On Saturday the team journeyed to
Meadville, but were "forced to accept a
defeat from the Alle_gheny College ﬁve
by a score of 39-15. This team has
the reputation.of being invincible on
their home ﬂoor and if the officiating
is always. as poor as it was in the
Pitt game there is small wonder that
this is true. With oﬁiciating as it
should be, Coach Flint hopes to see
his forces down the Allegheny artists
on March 16th when they play in
Pittsburgh; The Meadville , team
cinc'hed the game in the 'ﬁrst half
which ended 25-7 in their favor and
Pitt was unable to gain .much before
the end of the game.

The loss of this game gives Pitt a

total of 9. w.on out of 12 played.

Loss of Captain Halferty

Deficiency Due to Illness Causes Eligibility Committee to
Bar Track ‘Leader—-Pitt Will Be Well Rep-
resented in P. A. A. Meet

A hard blow was dealt thetrack
team last week when the name of
Captain Halferty was ‘stricken from
the list of those eligible to represent
the Gold and Blue on the cinder path
this spring. Halferty was a junior in
the School of Medicine, but illness
forced him to misslboth the fall and
winter- terms this year, so the com-
-mittee was forced to eliminate him
although it will materially weaken the
team. Halferty" ran on the relay
team last. season, but during the sum-
mer months surprised his f_riends by
winning -several mile and half mile
events against some of the best men
in the state. A couple of/months in
the open air since his illness has put
him in ﬁne condition and he is ex-
pected to score several points for P.
A. A. in their third annual meet next
month. _

The ﬁrst cross‘ country run was held
last Friday, and a large number of
candidates reported. The. course/was
from the Mines Building to the Bigo-
low Statue in'Seh-e-nley-«Park and back
being in all about a mile and half. The
-candidates who looked particularly
good were ‘Matt Marshall, Opsion
Haslett and Eastman, and -if these
men continue to improve Pitt will have
a quartet that will do well in distance
running. 4 Director Miller announced
after the run that he expected to have
a course of 2 and 3 miles laidoﬁ‘ and
set a time on each course, giving a
“cross—country button” to any candi-
date who would equal or -better t'he
limit. The time would not bo so easy
that a candidate would be a.ble to earn
a button the ﬁrst timeihee ran, but
would have to do consistent work to
make good.. It would not be neces-
sary to compete against, another man
but to run against time. It is planned
to have squads of men run three or
four afternoons a week, and any who
are willing to take this exercise are
requested to hand their names with
the afternoons they could run to Di-
rector Miller or Manager Hall.

Pitt will enter a full team in the P.
A. A. meet on Saturday even’ng, March

.9, at Duquesne Garden, and expects

to make a strong showing. The relay
candidates include Bryson, Rosenthal
and Davis of last year’s team, Matt
and Jim Marshall, Murphy, Connelly
and several other experienced quarter
milers. The plan is to have trial heats
of-the new men, three to qualify and

to run these three men and the thi-ee.

who made the relay team last year in
the ﬁnals. The‘ men who have entered
the novice quarter should enter the
relay trials to gain experience. Pitt
will be represented in every other
event but is particularly anxious to
win the relay prize.

Although prospects for a dual meet
with Ohio State were particularly
bright a_ week ago, it now looks as
though the arrangements had fallen
through. A dual meet at Washington

with W. & J. is now under way _a'ndi

the management hopes to close the
deal shortly. At present there is on
the schedule the P. A. A. meet of
March 9, the Penn relay games, April
27; the P. S. A. A.'meet at Harrisburg
on May 18, and the seventh annual in-
tercollegiate and interscholastic meet
at Tree’s stadium ofiMay 2'5th. Sev-
eral other meets -are probable.

The coach question is still unset-
tled, but the director now has a plan
that will prove a wonderful success if
carried out. The idea is to have such
men as H. E. Friesell, Dean of the
School of Dentistry and a former all
round track. star, “Davy” Sheehan, fa-
mous sprinter, Harry C. Fry, a well-

known’. local star and “Waldy” Zieg, I

who tossed the hammer 150 feet for
Pitt several years ago, each devote a
couple of afternoons a week to the
track aspirants. These men would un-
doubtedly consent to such an arrange-
ment and the team would be ‘wonder-
fully beneﬁted by such a move. Mr.
Parge, of the Medical School and an
instructor at P. A. A., has applied for
the position of track coach.

 

TECH GAME NEXT. V _
The Gold and‘ Blue forces will line

up against the Carnegie Tech ﬁve at ,

the Westinghouse Club in Wilkins-

burg next Friday night. The follow-*

ing week will ﬁnd tlhe Pitt team in the
East and it is hoped that a large crowd
of rooters will be on hand to give the
team a good sendoff in the /Tech game.

Here’s the way the matter stands:
Pitt has already won the ﬁrst game

of a three-game series for the cham— ‘

pionship of the city and if we win this
game Friday Tech will be out of the
running. Let's be at that game 200
strong and give Tech such a s-mear—
ing that she‘ will never forget it. Beat
themin basketball and drown out
their feeble, rooters! Don’t miss it,

. you may not have another chance to

see Pitt -play Carnegie’s.pets againthis

THE PITT

WEEKLY

 

COLLAPSE 0F PLATFORM
ENDS WRESTLING MATCH
/The wrestling match for the su-
premacy of the school came to an ab-
rupt end last Monday night when the
platform which had recently been
erected for the bouts collapsed. There
were several people in the ring be-
sides the contestants and ofﬁcials, but
luckily no one was h-urt.
The first match was between'Manos
a well-known local Greek wrestler of
the freshman class, and Collins, also
a freshman. Manos gained a fall in
one hour and thirty minutes, and as
Collins was slightly injured and un-
a-ble to continue, the former was
awarded the decision by Referee “Joe”
Choynski. Wills of t-he sophomores
then'challenged Manos and stile bout
had gone nearly the six-minute limit
when the platform fell. This match
was an exciting one, as the stren-gth

 

and science of the Greek wrestler was _

equalled by the nerve and aggressive-
ness of his lighter opponent. , Twice
Wills pressed Manos’ shoulders nearly
to the mat, but each «time the Greek
rolled just in time to save himself
from being pinned, down. Wills also
had some close calls, butgit is proba-
ble that he would have won the de-

cision had the bout not ended so ab-

ruptly. Manos recently slapped Mc-
Cully of Carnegie Tech to the mat in
two straight falls in a match -at the P.
A. Afandthereby won the admiration

I of every loyal Pittite.

A fencing bout had been arranged
between Prof. G. ,W. Postgate, the

s new fencing instructor, and one of his

best pupils, but this had‘ to be called
off on account of the platform break-
ing. Director Miller has promised
however, that both the fencing and
wrestling matches will be continued at
a later date. ’

PITT MAY MEET -
CHINESE IN BASEBALL

 

Manager Grove of the baseball team
has recently received an offer of a
game fromthe manager of a Chinese.
collegiate baseball team. An all-star
collegiate team has been formed in
China and expects to make an ex-
tended tour of this country, playing
the teams of larger colleges en route.

Manager Grove will probably accept
their terms as the game would be a
good drawing card in Pittsburgh.

NORMAN HACKETT SPEAKS.

Lecture on “Shakespeare and the
Drama” Is Given at Friday Chapel.

 

Norman Hackett, the noted actor,
who was playing in Pittsburgh last
week, spoke on the subject “Shakes-
peare and the Drama” to the students
at chapel on Friday. He began his
address by giving an excellent de-
scription of Shakespeare’s home, and
the country surrounding'St'ratford.. He
followed that with a plea for greater
interest in the classic dramas of
Shakespeare. Concerning those classic
plays he said: ,

“They are a glorious Anglo-Saxon
inheritance; the inﬂuence of which no
one can afford to miss. There is a
need for a stimulated interest in this
subject for I regret to say that Shakes-
peare as a popular form of entertain-
ment no longer exists in America. It
is not only a lamentable ‘fact but a
disgraceful one that Shakespeare has
been almost wiped off the boardsof
our’ theaters.”

“The reason is that there is. too
great a cry in America to—day for
only-the modern“ things. People are
thinking only of the lates.t aeroplane
the newest automobile and the style
of dress, forgetting ‘the_ traditional
things, which are absolutely necessary
-in rounding out the character of a na-
tion and its people.

“The trouble with the students of
Shakespeare is that they are prone to

think him deep, vague and beyond,

their comprehension, when, if they
would only cultivate an interest and
love for the man in his early life, they
would have no troub1e,‘.fo"r Shake-
speare is always simple, always direct
and always human. Throw away your
commentator’s books and rely upon
your own judgment to form your
opinions of -him. ~

“I would -like to see a better use of
pure English. Our everyd.ay speech
is corrupted. There is too great a
tendency to cut short our syllables.
We should not be so careless, for we
are ab‘e to understand the capabilities
of 2 rfiaii’s'— ability by the English he
uses.

“Foreign cdtfﬁti‘i.e§ have tlreir ‘na-

tional theaters, regulated by the gov-
ernment, and the people are taught
to demand only the best in dramatic
literanture, w-hile in America the theater
is looked uponas aamere place of
amusement. The crying , need ii;
America is a more general respect for
the theater as ainecessary institution
in our civic life. The church, the
schoolhouse and the theater are the
three most potent inﬂuences in our
civilization.

“Our great universities are awaken-
ing to the real facts and demanding
that more attention be paid to the
study. of the drama. vProf. George
Baker of Harvard has introduced a
course in play—writing with results
that are most encouraging, In this
way will an American drama of our
own be developed with the aid of the
church, the schools and the home.”
