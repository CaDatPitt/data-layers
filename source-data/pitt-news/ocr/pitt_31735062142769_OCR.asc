There appears in this edition the results of men ’s fraternity
rushing. The number of men who have chosen to add fraternity
life, to their college existence is greater‘ this semester than
ithas ever been at Pitt. It is expected, due to the increase in
their numbers, that fraternity men will begin to play an even
more "prominent part in college life andiactivities. It follows,
then, that more space will be given them in the student news-
paper. _ 9 ' p '

_ With this situation existing it is likely that there will be
resentment on the part of independent students, who will feel
they are being slightcd, overlooked, or, in general, being pushed
into the background. There is no denying that friction exists

, over this situation even now, and it is probable that it will

grow‘-in intensity as fraternity membership enlarges.

But the problem is not peculiar to Pitt. In any large uni-
versity there is this condition. In world politics there is a con-
tinual struggle between the “ins” and the “outs”.

As citizens of the United States we must strive to further
cooperation on the part of world governments to lessen the
tension existing ‘between countries. As Pitt students, we must
also cooperate to reduce the friction existing between two large
university groups. . .

"For years the problem has rested in a comfortablelniche,
kept warm by occasional cries of “Independents! Arise! Arise!”
But each time the handful of interested students has been

I stopped+by fraternity opposition or by disinterest on the part

of the independentvstudent body itself.

In a university this size it is impossible for anyone, includ-

ing the student newspaper, to have knowledge of the activities
of all its students. Knowledge comes to us, and to the rest of
the students, through organized channels. There are many rum-
ors abroad about the activities of various groups of students,
but We would be criticized severely, and justly, if we were to
print some of the material we are asked to -—-material which
cannot be checked because it .does not come from a reliable,
organized source. -
' The answer is organization, whether it be of the indepen-
dent students or a group studying the eﬁect of smoke on
Pittites in the tuck shops. If organization is impossible for
certain types of student activities, then all we can ask is that
each and every student supports the group to which he now be-
lcngs. The vets’ organization, Student congress, WSGA—all are
crying for your participation. Support them! And you will
_have a voice through them. ~

-Then, and only then, will you make it possible for us to
give you the complete coverage that we are striving for. Your
organization and support can help us to help you.

Magician Sees

Close Struggle

by Margaret Hurrell

Who is going to win the Inter-
class Sing?

Since the theme is “O-.ce Upon
a Time,” we thought that Merlin
the Magician in King Arthur’s
Court would be just the person to
tell us the winner. V

When we were ushered into his
gray and ebony oﬁfice, he rose
from his pure white throne and,
handing us each a wisp ofsmoke,
murmured, “Have a smoke.” We
were a bit taken back, but graci-
ously accepted, and then present-
ed our question to him. ‘

“Well,” he whispered in a
shaky, _sc-arcely audible voice; “the

thusiasm of a new class, but the
Sophomores will seek to win as
they did last year.” Here he paus-
ed, and we, took out our pencils
and papers to write notes ‘down.

Weird music began to play in
the background. “On the other
hand,” he mused, “the Juniors
will want their chance. And the
Seniors . . . ’-’ here we had to
strain our ears to hear him . . .”
the Seniors have Won twice. They
will desire their last fling.” His
voice faded out.

“But Merlin,” we protested,
“who is going to win?”

-“I am weary,” he muttered.
“See me this afternoon.” ~

“But the sing will be over
then!” we exclaimed.

Merlin shook his white locks.
Before we could say anything, the
castle and mist faded into smog.
We were back in the Commons
room again.
