burgh business man, Pitt‘ graduate
and son of George Woods, former
chancellor of the University, who
died last Wednesday in his home in
Sewickley. .

Mr. Woods was one of the leading
insurance men in the United States;
It was due largely to his active in-

established. He was a member of.
the , committee to study, investigate
and revise’ insurance laws of Penn-
sylvania from 1917 to 1921.

Mr. ‘Woods was born in Pitts-
burgh in 1865 and graduated from
Pitt, then Western University of
Pennsylvania, in 1883. He received
the degree master of arts in 1917
and from Princeton two years later.
His father was Chancellor of the
University for a period of 22 years’,
from 1858 to 1880. V

Made president in 1910 of the Ed'-
ward A. Woods company, Mr. Woods
held that position until his death.

No-Modern Art, N 0 ‘Washing
Machines, Say “Vaga.bonds"

 

 

“If we like the new civilization, we
must like modern‘ art, and _if we do.
not ‘accept the new type‘ of art, then
we “ should vrefuse telephones and
washing machines in our homes,”
said Jan Gordon, “vagabond artist,”
in his lecture‘ on modern art at Car-
negie lecture‘ hall Saturday evening.
Gordon, accompanied by his wife,
Cora Gordon, both painters and
critics of‘ authority, came to Pitts-
burgh under the auspices of the ﬁne
arts department. ‘

Mr. Gordon emphasized the fact

‘nothing more than an aspect _of
thought which canpbe more readily
put down on a ﬂat surface with
pencil and paper. , —
“Contemporary critics, when ' first
asked their opinion. of modern art
said, ‘It mus_tn’t’,”_ stated Gordon.
“Now, they say ‘it isn’t’, that is, the
present art is not modern enough."

Gordon believes.

art, itself, has. not changed; it is
only a development of the past, Mr.
Gordon holds. He believes that art
does not depend on formulae, but
that, it can be likened to modern

any recipe providing he is angood‘
cook. “ln ‘art-it is the same, Mr.
Gordon pointed‘ out.‘ “Ifr_we_ are
good artists it makes no difference
what method of attack we -employ.

People began to .recognize the new
art when viewing the ﬁrst products
of impressionism. Close‘ on the
heels of impressionism came cubism.
Then with the blending of the two
came modern art. These successive
stages ‘are identiﬁed by a more com-
plicated technique, and additional
beauty. Mr. Gordon brought out the
fact that there is no rule for the
ﬁnal selection of beauty, for ‘_‘we can
only accept or _re;)ect the opinion of
artists and critics.” _ '-

Mr. Gordon related how his book,
“Modern Painters in France,” had
,arisen ‘through talks with‘ his dentist.
§Ea'ch time he went to have his teeth
‘cared for the dentist brought up a
new discussion of art.. As a result,
Mr. Gordon would write a_ chapter
on the subject and send it to his
self-appointed critic. Finally these
chapters were collected and com-
bined in book form.

In a short. talk to assembled parents“
Dr‘. Bowman asked parents to co-

their daughters’ progress. . One
‘gray-haired mother, after speaking
‘with tlieteacliers, said, “I think this
is the best thing that could be done‘
for the. parents.” Another parent
in fspeakingof her son said: “He
didn't want to goto school-; he want-

— Maurice I-I. Kendall, instructor: in-

An important forward. step in the
'a'ctifviIties of the ‘General Alumni As-
sociation is ‘the inauguration of the
“Alumni Reading Lists” under the
auspices ;of the Alumni Education
Committee of Alumni Council. The
first of ‘these was mailed lastjweek
by the Joseph Horne Co. to all mem-
bers of the association and to the‘
faculty- Any former student of the
—Universit_y will be placed upon the
mailin list on request. '

ropriately, ' devoted to “Modern

the coaching staff there, and stopped

to Fort Benning, Ga., Where he is
assigned to the 29th Infantry. 
“Tiny" regrets he cannot compete
in the “0ld-Timers" game at the
stadium Saturday against the var-.

sity. He is in good trim, as a result j

of his coaching work at West Point,
_and said he would not be averse to
tackling a football game. The fans
will be disappointed in not seeing.-
him match his‘ prowess ‘ with f.‘.‘Bu1—'

“Tiny” expects to be ‘called back
to West Point in the spring to help

power of attraction which all newthings

night on the campus the new makes its
arance when Pitt Players,‘ campus dra-
_c organization, presents its first program

, Players represent the epitome of new-
.Stu'dents whohave never had the op-
nity to- see members of one ofthe’ largest

‘ interpretation‘ and‘. justification?‘

Dear Mr. Editor: '

I was considerably cheered- to find.
in ‘your last issue an editorial on
Conipanionate Marriage; :,consider‘a‘-
bly "pleased, because it’_ shows’ a
choice of subject which should ap-
peal to thinking individuals, ‘for’,,as7
you ‘say in the editorial, the‘-_co.ll‘eg‘e"
is the place for such people. Also

versity iwhiclfprefers pugilists and
radio announcers“ to._persons‘ inter‘-5.
ested in controversial’ discussions.
But I thinkgno one acquainted’
with the subject will‘ fail‘ to» seek that‘
the article,‘ P displays’ ‘unfairness! and-.
ignorance of even the most Pele-
mentary aspects of the subject.
The author states his..p_llrpose,, to
examine: Comp-anionatei Marriage
“along logical lines.” “  logical
is ‘he? He says,"“Corn‘panionate
Marriage. is “ indicative H of’ an uncer-
taintyon. the part of twoindividuals

as to the lasting; quality‘ of their I

‘love for each other.” This is the
recognized deﬁnition -of Trial ‘Mar-.
riage, a subject irrelevant to our
discussion. Judge. .Lindsay recog-
nizes no such deﬁnition in his recent
book; ,yet he cites him as the au-’
thority on-the subject.

He tears his hair over the sorry‘
plight of “a motherless and ‘father-
less child in its period of growth,”
But one_ of ‘the ﬁrst conditions of
the Conflpanionate Marriage is that
there shall bc“no children.  V

Yesterday they told me. Michael wa‘s\,_d.ead. A week ago they
laid him under a frozen earth ;' they hid forever his wavy hair,
his" shining eyes.

Once when I wandered down -the long aisle to first communion,

Michael paced restlessly, amid_ the candles and carried with a -

serene grade. the. golden plate along the altar. rail‘. 1" dreamed; when
the fragrance of lilies bore down upon‘ "me that..he was an. angel;
or. a heavenly singer.’ His tall ﬁgure, that ‘never to my blurred,

child eyes seemedjawlcward, was saintlike, ‘and I divided my prayers

between him and the virgin. No one could-being. asishe did, bring-*4

ing love and -joy and serene laughter into-’ a} chant, and" at Lauds

. on- M‘au_day Thursday‘ when the, organ"-"is stilled. and a voice alone-

singsﬂin’ the ‘dim church, Michael’ moved‘ a world into the praises-
of God. But his was a world out out by candles‘ in the dark. where
the sound or chimes ﬁlled the stillness with. music. Daylight: and‘

the loveliness of snow on bare branches. were as nothing to him. c

He stood apart as an altar stands high and distant from the crowd.

And then; a_ year ago-an organ murmured as. _slowly_ from-

bent knee before the high altar, Father Michael rose and turned

down the shadowed forest of pillars‘. Alongtheaisle. he paced slorwly,.”.
his eyes closed beneath his bloodless brows and his tapping feet.

rhythimically echoed among the vaults. He turned. again with a

singular grace and climbed the pulpit, and ‘when he crossed; him-’...
self majestically after the fashion of the Jesuits, his eyes‘-ﬂashed --

tawny lights like those of a tiger that never has tasted blood. . ’

.Never shall those eyes glow again, bright in a new experience";

never, shall he move a woman’s heart into a song“--as sinister as 79.-
jungle call. He isdead,’ and yesterday upon hisvtomb they placed
‘a. wreath saying, “He gave himself to God.” . 4 '

In This Day

The sound of trees swayed in his dreams and he muttered slow,-

sad words as if he lay sick at heart and ready to die. He stirred.

- restlessly among the tangled‘ covers -and his eyes opened to. a
morning stained ‘with, red and lovely with wet winds that blew.
' Virom. distant? ﬁelds. of“ buttercups and‘ May apples. Often he had

seen (such a morning when -he, a child, had played serious games
and made silver’ with a drop of water injthe lilac leaves._
He had nc"ver-"wanted to getup; again, »he had thought when

at midnight he had crawled into bedﬂafter a. stroll‘ between_ the",

hours. of dusk and,night. -On other ’evéii-ings he had been’ content
with his ﬁre, his pipe, and his book or with,talking_ to Anna and
Kate. and -the: other drab souls who’ lived. in= the same faded house,-

‘ Anna. would growli about the. bookshop“ and, her feet hurting and

Kate would laugh? cynically at boys and. girlsf-who» came to -school
when they might ‘be better off.’ earniisgv a few pe!‘tnies"_.O;1’_ street

thoughts in ‘a little book. He hadbeen writing for years in this‘

.. smallrblack book, and each time he opened it,’ he hopedzto ﬁnd

On that night the calmness of his --life had, suddenly oppressed;

him and he had‘ wandered out into the spring dusk. The streets‘

lay-~-silent‘ with Aonlyv-the? scres.i‘ning7~.,_.of-i- .children in play circles‘

and tried to forget: it. The wind that ri1Rlcd_his- hair swept througli

the fresh grass bringing. the smell! of a warniing "earth. Again

he stepped along more vigorously, laughing a bit until the =.passers-

deeper, gray eyes that darted; through:  fog. And; then as he
turned a corner under. a’ blaze__ of movie lights; l1e.saw her. He-

Thc winter, day was still an hour of,
With just a shadow moon up in the sky.

Our old hay-wagon stood hub-deepj,in“ snow,

Swollen with snow. Then I stepped“ into; the: path. ‘

Still warm from tucking underneath my pillow,

‘And .thc smoking lantern in my other hand

I heard old muzhik John slam the door

Clinkedhcr halter chain and rustled her hay;
In sleepy voice he mutterc--T .:.=a.~.:.l-.. oaths.
Odorous steam poured from the open .:’-tor,

Cows rose to their feet, and altogether‘
Swishccl their tails. I found my stool; then. . ,
Dragging some straw, a. handful, from Bessie’: bed,
Spread it upon the cold top of the. stool. .
From the cold teats I brushed the strands of straw,
Andrtarted todraw the milkintfo‘ the pail.
The thin stream rings against ‘the still clean tin,

This is a light worlt in the classical

.Rachmani1loﬁ"sf Symphony No. 2 in
E Minor, Op-. 27. Rachmaninoff. is
a living Russian of the- romantic
school? and is known best as a con-

rather early work‘ and at times is
overlysentimental. It is saved from
banality in many places only by the
masterful orchestration. Mr. SORC-
lolf, since’ he is a Russian, should
give. us .a sympathetic; interpretation
of the work. ' ‘ .

Saturday’ afternoon’s program is

Schubert's “Unﬁnished’." Symphony
opens the program. Everybody who
has ever heard any orchestral ‘music
knows the two movements of this
masterpiece. Just why it was never

Th s contest, beginning at two

will bring together the greatest col-
lection. of former Panther stars‘ ever
to grace an athletic ﬁeld. P , 

'With all sorts of» ‘bear’ stories
leaking outjof the Stanford strong-.
hold in the West, such -a move was
made and called by the Panther
board of strategy. Once again P_lt_t
followers will have -an opportunity
to see such All-American‘artist.s. as:
Bob Peck, -Tommy. Davies, Horse
Chase, Pat Horton,-Hilty, Wissinger,
Herb -Stein  Charlie]Bowser, to-

cluding‘ Jess. Brown, Tuffy McMillen,
Tinyllewitt, Tiny Linn, Red Seidel-
son; Jack Sack, Jim Bond, Buck
Templeton, Pie Williams and.Har-

 vey Harmon.

This collection of grid stars who

i have made_ football history at. the

university in years gone by, will

prove rather..conclusively just what”

metal the present aggregation of
Pitt players are made of. Plans
call for the old-timers meeting at
the "stadium" Thursday’ afternoon and
going through a strenuous drill on

. the" stadium ﬁeld for two hours fol-

lowed with another drill ‘Friday.
TWO of the old-timers will be se-
lected to act as coaches and_v;'fork
out a set of signals and plays so
they may be able to throw _a strong
team against the Goldens and pro-
vide a real practice session.

tered into the idea with a- zealthat

of the wonderful shape» the old-
timers are‘ in.
been coaching .at V. P. I. Tuffy Mc-
Millen has just led his team
through a very successful season at
Clearﬁeld. Jess Brown and Herb
Stein have been keeping ﬁt play-
ing pro ball and busily attending to
a pig farm in--Ohio. ..-r“Horse.’3. Chase
is athletic director? at McKeesport
and has rubbed away all surplus fat

_ by practicing with his team and

playing pro ball. Tom Davies is
coaching at Rochester University.
These old-timers are well- versed
in the Warner system and -undou..bt-
edly will use their brains" ratherthan
their weight to outsmart the pres-
ent stars. For the backﬁeld, the old-
timers can call on such stars as:
Tomm§ Davies, Andy Gustafson,
Jess rown, Jakiei Borhen, -- Tiny

Herron, Horse Chase, Red Seidelson,
Jack Sack, Buck Templeton, _Pie

Williams, Harvey Harmon, Charlie.

Bowser, Herb Stein, Tuffy McMillen,
Bob,Peck,_ Zeke Wissinger and sev-

eral others.

While no deﬁnite; plans. have been
madeias to admission, it is probable
that’ a contribution in the way of
buying Christmas seals will be used.

McN‘amee, the best known radio
announcer in the world, who spe-
cializes in announcing big" sport
events suchras the Dempsey-Tunney
ﬁght .- Army«Navy football game,
could not say '-deﬁnitely whether he
will announce the ‘ Pitt-Stanford
game. over the. radio January 2.

. The. famous, announcer was all
thrilled-about the Pitt game in Cal-
ifornia and between gulpy chews of
his wad of gum told us, “You know

 

it is a. darn nice trip out there (Cal-. 7

ifomia) and I sure would like to.

"tell the sports world just how the

Panthers play from the microphone
at the Rose. Bowl.” ' .. 

‘When. asked how he is betting on
the outcome of the game, McNamee
said, “I never bet on con_tests_ that
I announce. Pitt must have awow
of a footballteam but that coast
heat will handicap them. Last_ year
I announced ; the Rosegame in my
shirt sleeves.” -

“I enjoy announcing all sports. I
can't tell you the difference between
announcing collegiate, and profes-

sional sports because I have ‘never -
-' announced a college baseball game

or a professional football game. In

other words, I let the world know

about professional baseball and box-

iyngl happenings, and collegiate. foot-

, "The Army-Navy game was the
best game I saw. this year. The

cheering ‘and color displays were

finest in the country next to the
one at Washington.” '
McNamee together with his ‘side'-
kick, Philips Carlin, picked an all-.

spicuous because of their failure to
Defend-

OPEN a tidy red tin of Prince

Cool as ﬁnal exams. Sweet. as
