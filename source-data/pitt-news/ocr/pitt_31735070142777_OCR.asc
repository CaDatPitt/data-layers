Musical club seeks to fill campus void

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

Anewclub istryingtoﬁllagapfor
some theater enthusiasts who are dis-
appointedbythe lackofmusicaltheater
currently available at Pitt;

The Pitt Musical Theatre Club per-
formedavarietyofsongsfrommusicals
suchas“Wicked,”‘i’&venueQ”and“Cab-
aret” to an audience of students and

community members packed into the
Frick Fine Arts building Friday night.

The club held its ﬁrst performance
forfree with requests for donations.

Larissa Briley, co—director of the
performance and president of the
club, said she came up with the idea to
startthe group at the beginning oflast
semester. She asked herfriend Monica
Meinert to be vice president and help
directthe show. ,

They set up a table at the Student

Activities Fair at the begirming of this
year and provided contact information
lists for interested people.

“The responses from people were
amazing,” Meinert said.

Briley saidthe group got“pages and
pages” of e—mail addressesfrompeople
who attended the fair. *

More than 200 students joined
the club’s Facebook group, and more
than 60 showed up to the ﬁrst meet-
ing, Meinert said. Currently, about 30

members attend meetings regularly,
she said.

Throughoutthe semester, the group
hosted speakers and watched musicals
together. Meinert said she and Briley
wanted it to be more than a perfor-
mance group. They wanted the club
to be for anyone who enjoyed musical
theater.

“We wanted to stress that you can
appreciate musical theater without
performing it,” Meinert said.

Carnegie
fines hiked
50 percent

Carnegie Library
changes its overdue
policy to weather debt

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

To reduce its debt, Carnegie Li-
brary of Pittsburgh will increase
service fees and ﬁnes on overdue
materials beginningjan. 1.

The increased fines and fees
are part of a plan, approved by

the library’s Board of Trustees

this past October, to address a
projected $1.5 million funding
shortfall for 2010.

The increases come at a criti-
cal time when funding for library
services remains ﬂat, even as
the demand for library services
continues to rise, according to a
news release. '

Fines on overdue adult books,
VHS, CDs and MP3s will increase
to 30 cents per day, while ﬁnes on
all overdue children’s materials
will increase to 20 cents per day.
Currently, the late fee for adult
materialis 20 cents per day and
there .is no fee on overdue chil-
dren’s material.

The library’s Board of Trust-
ees will meet Monday to discuss
other ways to decrease its debt,
including the possible closures
of four-of its branches.

For the performance, Meinert

people’s capabilities were. All 35 stu-
dents who showed up for auditions

The diﬁiculty of planning musi-
cals

Pitt currently offers programs
through the Pitt Repertory Theatre,
which performs plays and student-
directed productions. There are sev-

.eral theater groups on campus, such

as Buscare and the Redeye Theatre
Project, but the Pitt Musical Theatre

Clubiscurrentlytheonlystudentgroup V

focused on musical theater.

Bruce McConachie, who chairs
the theater department, said that his
department offers a musical theater
class and some play productions that
feature music.

He saidthe mainproblemwithpro-
ducing a musical is that it can be very
expensive. Musiciansforapitorchestra
canbe one of the biggest expenses.

McConachie said that in the past,
the music department and the theater
department have not been able to col-
laborate for a musical theater produc-
tion. Part of the ‘reason, he said, was
thatmusiciansinthe music department
often performed other kinds of work.

He said without volunteer musi-

cians, the theater department: would

have to hire, and along with costume,
set and royalty expenses, producing
a musical might not bring in enough
revenue inbox oﬂice sales to outweigh
the costs. ,

Mathew Rosenblum, the music
department chair, said he thought
any opportunity for music students
to play would be “great,” and the de-

partment has collaborated with the

theater department before for some
productions.
Rosenblum, who became the de-

partinentchairirizoorz, saidhe doesn’t .

recall being approached about a mu-
sical, but its possible that in the past,
there wasn’t enough interest among
music students.

“Ifthere’s interest, there’s_interest,”
Rosenblum said.“Ifthere’s not, we can’t
force studen .” .

Rosenblum said thatthe music de-
partmentcould“puttheword out,”and

students who were interested could

volunteer.

McConachie said if a club could
guarantee the department that there
would be students to play in a pit or-
chestraforamusical production, then
the theater department might be able
to “go ahead” with a production. But
that’s notlikelytohappenanytimesoon

because of the commitment it would ' 

require, he said. A

Both department chairs agreed
thatthe Pitt Musical Theatre Club was
agood idea.

“I hope they will be doing more
evenings of performances,” McCon-
achie said.

Sean Malloy, the groupfs musical director, said
performing and preparing for a show can be dif-

A ﬁcult, and that hewas impressedwith the dedica-

tioninthe club. _

“So many things can go wrong if people don’t
want to try,” Malloy said.

Lauren O’Leary, who graduated from Pitt in
April and attended the show,_said she appreci-
ated the variety of songs the club members per-
formed. .

. “You can tell how much effort they put into
it,” O’Leary said. I .

AustenTerwilliger; another Pitt graduatewhose
brother, Evan, performed inthe show, said hewas
impressed with the quality of the performances.

“I was surprised how this was just a club, but

they found so much talent,” Terwilliger said.

Jon DeBona, a junior marketing major, said

. when he came to Pitt, he really wanted to per-

form in musicals and was excited when the club
formed.

‘DeBon’a said the group is pushing to perform
aﬁrllmusicalinthefuuire, butthetaskcanbe dif-

ﬁcult. The rights to perform it can be expensive, .

he said.

The club members tailored some of the acts
to apply to college students. In a performance of
the song“WhatIsThis Feeling?”fromthe musical
“Wicked,” inwhichacollege—aged Glindaandthe

W1ckedWitchoftheWestfrom“TheW1zard0fOi’

meetfortheﬁrsttime as ill—fated roommates. The.

cast members changed the lyrics to make it seem
like the eventtook place at Pitt. '

Some of the other acts were more adult-ori-
ented.

The cast performed“The Internet Is forPorn”
from the musical‘iAvenue Q,”whichfea13ures pup-
pets singing songs with adult themes (another
song from the show is called “Everyone’s a_Little

. Bit Racist”). This earned the loudest round of ap-

plause from the audience.

Students Katie Hutchison and Francis Dy —
. teamed up for the song, along with afour—person

men’s chorus. Hutchison, playing the role of a
teacher planning to educate children about the
Internet, ﬂaunted a squeaky, high—pitched voice,
while Dy, playing a puppet, sang his lines grav-
e11y- ' ‘ 0

They also performed “Totally F’-"cked” from

A the musical “Spring Awakening.”

Ben Kaye, who had alead role inthe song, was
born in London, where he said he went to shows

with his parents. He moved to New York seven 1 -

years ago, and now, he’s afreshman at Pitt. .

He said he didn’texpecttobesingingthemain

Cap and crunch

Amid the international crunch to thwart global
warming, Obama pushes berry good cap and

trade reform.

The United Nations Climate
Change Conference (COP15) for-
mally began yesterday in Copenha-
gen. The eyes of an asthmatic Earth
are looking for the 190 attending
nations to set a new standard in
carbon reduction. .

Cuts in emissions should have
happened a long time ago. Unfor-
tunately, the U.S. is the only indus-
trialized nation not abiding by the
Kyoto Protocol. Now is President
Barack Obama’s time to atone for
the sins of the father.

The big problem is getting mas-
sive polluters —— like the U.S. and
China — to agree on signiﬁcant
emissions cuts. Together, these
countries account for 40 percent
of all carbon emitted, accord-
ing to Nation Master statistics.
If they don’t agree on cuts, and
pledge help for unindustrialized
countries, smaller nations have
almost no encouragement to stiﬂe
their growth.

Thankfully, Obama managed
to get a pledge from China on his
recent visit — something obscured
by an excursion he’d otherwise like
to forget. China has agreed to cut
carbon dioxide emissions by at

least 40 percent below 2005 levels '

by 2020, according to the Global
Times. Likewise, the Obama plan
cuts emissions by 30 percent by
2025 and 80 percent by 2050.

' These are breakthrough pledg-
es, and we must refrain from jokes

. about hot air because it looks

like the U.S. means to enforce its
goals. ‘ 5

The Environmental Protection
Agency announced ‘yesterday that

it has the authority to unilater-. ‘
ally regulate carbon emissions.-

Because it found carbon dioxide
to pose health and environmental

dangers, the ‘EAPAidetermine'd it

no longenrequires congressional
legislation for action.
This is a monumental step.
Despite some hype over e-
mails," the climate is changing.

You don’t need a study — just look‘

at a time lapse of Mount Fuji. Yet
these e-mails threaten progress
because governments must be able
to combat climate change based on
trustworthy data.

Everyone knows something
must be done. The problem is how
to do it. ,-

Cap and trade‘will either up-
end the economy or.revolution-
ize it. Yet companies, and thus
their political lobbies, ﬁnd that
prospect too risky, especially in
a recession. .

Sometimes polluters have to
be bullied. The consequences of
climate‘ change are so long—term

they seem illusory. If the EPA is

going to enforce carbon limits, it
must do so with short-term conse-
quences, like hefty ﬁnes, to ensure
companies cannot simply continue
polluting because it‘ is still cost-
eﬂicient.

‘Global warming requires coun-
tries and companies to_think about
more than the bottom line. It’s a
moral issue, but one that could po-
tentially offer economic beneﬁts.

. This conference was held .in
Denmark because of the Danes’
swift and proﬁtable acceptance of
green ideals. Near Randers, local

‘farmers pool together to purchase

windmills. The turbines —— many
manufactured by the successful
Danish company Vestas — provide
so much power that some farmers
sell excess back to the grid. Near

' Copenhagen, the harbor situates

dozens of windmills that provide

A electricity for a bustling capital.

The Obama administration
should rightly promise carbon

cuts," and the EPA should actively if

enforce those new standards. Of-

ten, though, local efforts like these,

can help as much as anythreat or
treaty. . x
If Obama helps broker a climate

V deal including the U.S. and China,
v expect him to return to Copenha-

gent looking a little more deserving
of that Nobel Peace Prize in his

V pocket.

Eat, drink, be healthy

Pittsburgh ’s no Greek island, but we can learn from their lifestyles

   
 

Carolyn Gerecht
Columnist

‘ There’s this guy, Dean Karnazes.
, Hefs 47, Greek—American and was
,_..r’aised-in California. At age 11, he

hiked the Grand Canyon rim to rim.
But that’s not why he’s famous.
He’s famous for running —- a lot.
He once ran 135 miles across Death
Valley, with temperatures around
120 degrees. He ran a marathon
to the South Pole in negative—40—
degree weather. He ran 148 miles
on a treadmill in 24 hours. He ran
350 miles consistently over the
course of 80 hours. - l _
Recently, he ran 50 marathons
—— a marathon is 26.2 miles —, in
50 states in 50 days.
I So although [might want to call

him thelcraziest man in the world, '

Karnazes is more widely known as
the ﬁttest. V 5 4. '
Thus, I was intrigued when he
posted an_entry to his blog on the
Runner’s World website about a re-
cent study of the question, “Where

in the world do the hardiest human
beings -live, and what makes them
so healthy?” V

The study was led-by a man
named Dan Buettner. At age 27,
Buettner biked from Alaska to Ar-
gentina, a distance of more than

' 15,000 miles.

Don’t these people know “The
Real World” is on? ' I

The blog post says Buettner and
his team of scientists discovered
that the hardiest humans are from
the small Greek island of Ikaria.

Well, I’d be hardy too, if I lived
on a Greek island. 

But the real secret to their lon-
gevity is not the blue skies, beauti-
ful people or endless piles of phyllo
dough. As Karnazes says, “They

drink. They stay out late. They

don’t run. They eat loads of fat.”

Hurrah, college students! I
think the University has cause to
celebrate. ‘Look alive, Generation
Y: We’re gonna live forever.

The Buettner study, though,
turns out to ‘be more complicat-
ed. , I

It actually identiﬁed several

so-called Blue Zones around the
world, including Ikaria, as well as
cities in Italy and Costa Rica. In
Blue Zones, the population reached
the age of 100 at a rate 10 times
that of the United States.

Buettner attributes various
reasons to different regions. In
Greece, it’s the herbal tea, in Italy,
the wine and in Costa Rica, its the
high—ﬁber diet.

Buettner spends a great deal
trying to understand why Ameri-
cans don’t have the same rates of
longevity.

To be honest, I’m kind of con-
fused too. I don’t think any other
nation (especially regarding us
college students) cherishes a “sit
around, consuming stuff” lifestyle
like the grand ol’ U.S.

‘Come on, Buettner. Karnazes
said if we get drunk and sleep in,
We’re basically golden, right?

' Not so fast.

Even Karnazes was telling a
half-truth for the sake of a silly
blog post. Maybe Ikarians eat
fats, but we’re talking olives, not

fries. Maybe they don’t run, but

Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to the
editorial titled “Drinking policy
a safer standard.” I agree that
drinking at colleges and universi-
ties across the country has raised
issues for concern, but I think it is
unfair to hold Greek life responsi-
ble. We cannot be expected to cater
to those who lack self control.

Penn State has more than 50
fraternities, with more than 4,000

students involved in Greek life.

Some of its fraternities are double, ‘

if not triple, the size of the larg-
est houses at Pitt. They have more
resources, manpower and support
from their administrators to allo-
cate toward risk management for
their parties. ‘

Fraternities at Pitt do not have
the same luxury. Greek life already
spends thousands per- semester
for insurance, and we have risk
management teams and event

guest lists. We do the best we can.
We have not had any serious inci-
dences of which I know.

Greeks are not the risks at par-
ties — non-afﬁliates, like Joseph
Dado at Penn State, are. The stu-
dent body that refuses to go Greek
on this campus is what burdens us,
so suggesting to be more accom-
modating to them is ridiculous. -

To the Editor,

This letter addresses Mark
Kozlowski’s Dec. 7 column titled
“Health reform bill not viable.” Ko-

ugzlowski might not be a lunatic, but

he certainly does not know how to‘
make an argument.

In the beginning parts ofhis col-.
umn, Kozlowski bashes Medicare as
a bane to the American taxpayer,
saying that nearly one-quarter of
the funds doled out by the program
are fraudulent.

So, he argues, Americans should

, not rallybehindabillthat gives the

government more money to mis-
manage while the American tax-
payer foots the bill. Well, OK. So
far, sogood. , , ,

However,-§he‘ then argues that
health care reform is unnecessary
because Medicare looks after the
public sector’s health care needs.
So his solution to the health care
crisis? Expand the foundations of
the Medicare money pit. Is anyone
out there listening?

The exact reason we need health
care reform in this country is that

Medicaid is totally ineﬂicient an
unreliable.

If Kozlowski spent as much effort
actually thinking about the health
care problem in the U.S. as heap-
parently does linking together trite
arguments taken from conserva-
tive blog sites, he would realize that
his column not only fails to explain
why health care reform is bad for
Americans, but it also reveals why

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to Alie. Gensheimer’s Dec. 4 column on
how to live cheaply.

My fellow restaurant servers and I are appalled at this irresponsible
suggestion to save a couple bucks. Gensheimer should be ashamed.
She suggests that the consumer cheat restaurants to save money.
Businesses operate to make a profit. This recession has hurt every-
one, not just the consumer.

Restaurants already operate under.,the assumption that they will
have to absorb a lot of the costs before they can make a proﬁt. They
do not assume, however, that they will lose profits from customers
who are unwilling to pay for a product.

Restaurants specifically have a policy against sharing a buffet. It
is, inappropriate to purposely set up a confrontation with the wait
staff and management in an attempt for free food.

Additionally, servers are not stupid. If we see you sharing a refill-
able item, such as soda or coffee, you will be charged for two.

As far as not telling a server you plan to split an‘ item to avoid hav-

ing to split the charge, you do not play by the rules of the restaurant,

which purposely sets up a confrontation with management.

These suggestions are ethically wrong. J A .

We hope that The Pitt News’ readers will not heed Gensheimer’s
advice and think it is irresponsible that the paper would run such
a column.

My managers and fellow servers are outraged. We hope that the
paper will find some way to retract Gensheimer’s shameful sugges-
tions.

Fresh band combines folk and jazzy inﬂuences, plus soulful lyrics

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ’ Writer

Cavalier Rose

M Howler’s Coyote Cafe

Dec. 9, 8 p.m.
$5
(412) 682-0320

Accordingto Chase McGowan, his
band, Cavalier Rose, has atendencyto

- sound like a bomb slowly exploding.

“Itypicallybelieve thatthebestway
to describe music to another person is
by usingwords that have nothingto do-
with the music itself, but still relateto
the music you’re describing,” McGow-

an said in an e—mail interview.

Though listeners might not ﬁnd
this description accurate, Cavalier

Rose is rising in status and popular-_
. ity

Aside from ballistic noise, Cavalier
Rose’s music is ablend offolk and‘jazz
accompanied by haunting vocals.

' Since2oo4—whenthetwowere

in college — McGowan and guitarist ‘

Garrett Gibbs Drinon sought raw and
creative people to play with, Drinon
said. '

Butthere wasn’t too much of a plan
involved, McGowan said.

“The band and its sound have come
together organically, [without] much
planning or speciﬁcally discussed

direction,” McGowan said. “I guess
you could say it’s been a spontaneous
evolution.” ,

_ Evolution might not be the most
accurate word, though.

“I don’t think we’ve had enough
time to evolve yet,” Drinon said. “It
‘feels very new and we’re still getting
around to different sides of what we
can do. I hope it’s always like that.”

New as they are, Cavalier Rose
garnered a fan base during its time
in its home in Brooklyn, a musical
epicenter. '

“There are a lot of serious music
fans in the area who love seeing new
bands and going to shows,” McGowan
said. “With that being said, we also
make sureto be out constantly ﬂyering
local shows and meeting other fans of
musicinour area.” . .

The band is branching from its
home in New York for a small-scale
tour. ‘

But for Cavalier Rose, the idea of
community extends beyond the city.

“For me,when it comes downto it,
it’s all about the relationship to other
musicians,” Drinon said. “I feed off

that. They give me ideas and they put 1

my own ideas into context, even if it’s
justarecord that I’m listeningto. That’s

V what the band is to me  sharing.”

Though some members play in
other bands on rare occasions, they

all focus on Cavalier Rose, allowing
for blossoming friendships and the
creation of the band’s stylish sound.

“We allbringcompletely different
thingstothetable, and sovaryingfrom
songto song, you’ll hear more or less
our individual styles come out,” vocal-
ist and key player Heather Christian
said.

Christian also revealed a prime
topic for their songs.

“Desire. Inthe sexysense mostap—
parently, but also in a cerebral one,”
said" Christian. “Usually the song is
trying to ﬁgure something out. I’m
pretty certain that it’s more interest-
ing to write songs that are questions
and not answers.” -

Other players expressed similar
opinions.

“Wedon’tbrandourmaterial,soit .

allows usto go inany direction the song
callsfor,” said drummer SarahTomek.
“We speak more in visual terms and
avoid generic labels, so the music only
evolves as well as its members.”

The evolving band is united in its
beliefthatitis inagoodplace andhave
somethingto be proud of —— even if it
happens to disagree on just how far
it’s come.

“We need more soul and passion
outthere,” McGowan. “I hope Cavalier
Rose has the opportunity to convey
that sentiment to many.”

Psystar stops selling “hackintosh” machines

Apple sued the third% party hardware company for infringement

Donald Campbell
Columnist

   

There is some news in the
world of Apple OS X and its Erid
User License Agreement, or

< EULA.

Psystar — a small company
created in April 2008 to produce

third-party hardware capable of l
, running slightly modiﬁed ver-
’ sions of Apple’s Macintosh OS X

operating. system — has pulled
all of its “hackintosh” offerings
from its website.

This occurrence seems to be
one of the last steps in an ongo-
ing battle between Psystar and
Apple. * 7

Apple took Psystar to court,
arguing that creating and mar-

keting its Mac OS X—enabled
products infringed upon Apple’s
stated license agreements, which
strictly forbid running Macintosh
OS X on hardware not produced
by Apple Computer, Inc.

An article published on Dec. 1
in OSNews, an online computer
magazine, reported that Apple
Computer and Psystar success-
fully entered into an agreement

‘ to settle court proceedings.

 

The world of Mac cloning, without the help of
Psystar, is also alive and well.‘ ’

Apple certainly ‘came out the
victor, as Psystar agreed to stop
all sales of its “hackintosh” ma~
chines.

Until the agreement, Psys-
tar’s Website proudly displayed
its line of computers, including
the OpenDuo, the Open(Q) and
the Open(7).

Psystar even went so far as to
create an enterprise-level, rac
mount server for heavy process-
ing.

All Psystar machines could be
preloaded with Microsoft Win-
dows, Ubuntu Linux or '— con-
troversially —— Apple’s Macintosh

Disney introduces first black princess

~ New princess Tiana dives into classic animation techniques in “The Princess and the Frog”

Azia Squire
Staff Writer

“The Princess and the Frog”

Starring: Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Cam-
pos, Keith David, Oprah Winfrey
Directors: Ron Clements, John Mus-

_ker

Studio: Walt Disney Anim‘atior_1_ Stu-
dios‘ _ ~. _. .  ’   
Grade: A-. V   T

“The Princess and the Frog” marks the
ﬁrst appearance of a black princess in a
Disney fairy tale and the return of illustra-
tion — that is, traditional 2-D animation
-— to the big screen.

The animated musical is loosely based
on E.D. Baker’s “The Frog Princess,” which
is of course based on the fairy tale, “The
Frog Prince.” Disney’s update manages

to be both visually stunning and well- A

paced. « .
Set in early 1900s in New Orleans, “The

' Princess and the Frog” tells the story of

Tiana (Anika Noni Rose‘), a young waitress '
workinghard to make enough money to

buy a restaurant in order to keep the. spirit

—— and legendary gumbo — of her father

(Terrance Howard) alive.

She gets outbid for a building and, in a
depressed daze, lets herself be convinced
to help Charlotte (Jennifer Cody), her up-
roarious blond—haired, blue—eyed best
friend, win the affection of a prince — any
prince would do. A

Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), of the
ﬁctional Maldonia, happens to be the one
Charlotte sees first. i .

But the evildoings of a voodoo magi-
cian, Doctor Facilier, played by a fantastic
and devilish Keith David, turns ‘Prince
Naveen into a frog, which is how he

/ stumbles upon Tiana. In frog form, Prince

Naveen mistakes Tiana for a princess in

_ her gown and tiara.

He bribes her to kiss him with promis-
es of money that he doesn’t have, because
unbeknownst to Tiana, his parents cut him
off. With visions of her father’s restaurant
clouding her reason, Tiana puckers up,
only to be turned into a frog herself.

The two then embark on a journey to
become humans again, making friends
with a hilarious j azz-playing alligator (Mi-
chael-Leon Wooley) and a gentle-hearted
Cajun ﬁreﬂy (Jim Cummings). .

“The Princess and the Frog” might
make audiences wonder why anyone
stopped using traditional animation.

It’s gorgeously drawn with explosive -

use of color, which is most mesmerizing
in’ Doctor Facilier’s scenes.

His mystical voodoo encounters are
ripe with slick lime greens and plush pur-
ples, but the creepy shadow counterparts
that do his bidding might be too much
for children. _

Doctor Facilier is one of the most’ en-
tertaining Disney villains we’ve seen thus
far, ﬁlling in for Tiana and Prince Naveen

where they ultimately lack.

Though sweet-natured and dedicated,
Tiana is kind of a snooze, blind to facts
that are right in front of her. The charis-
matic Prince Naveen is a jerk and at times

refers to women as objects — his verse in.

the song “When We’re Human’? is about
just that.

However, these flaws are not what
keeps them from reaching that third di-

mension, it’s the fact that they’re frogs

for the majority of the film.

Watching them in their frog—t'astic hi-
jinks is fun at times, but viewers can’t help
but wish our ﬁrst black princess didn’t
spend most of the movie being green.

OS X.

N on—Apple devices that run Apple oper-
ating systems are commonly referred to as
Macintosh ,“clones” or hackintoshes.

Psystar truly angered the beast that is
Apple by claiming to sell large quantities

‘*and making OS X commercially available
on non-Apple hardware. ' A l A

Before Psystar, an interested user
would have to turnto an expansive com-
munity of developers who “hacked” OS X

to load it on, well, say, a Dell.

Apple turned its annoyance into a legal
matter, bringing a suit against Psystar
in California. Apple pointed out that the
Apple End User License Agreement forbids
the modification of the OS X code in order

q to run it on non-Apple hardware.
Apple argued that by selling machines j

(total sales ending up around 760) Psys-
tar repeatedly violated its license agree-
ment. ‘

Psystar fought the accusation but was
ultimately required to pay $2.675 million
to Apple, according to an article published
by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes on ZDNet’s
online news portal. »

. So what does this indicate about the
world of Apple clones?

1 Can Apple breathe easier, assuming
that its mission to force absolute obedi-
ence to its license agreement has been
fully successful?

As with many rules put “forth by com-

puter manufacturers and software de— A

velopers, Apple will continue to have a
problem with programmers subverting
its licenses. ’

Psystar, as part of its settlement, was
not explicitly required to stop sales of a
piece of softwareit developed to allow us-
ers to modify Macintosh OS X for loading
on non-Apple hardware.

In other words, Apple decided
that running Macintosh OS

X on non-Apple hardware is
unsuitable.

Thus, the software, called Rebel EFI, is
still available on Psystar’s website.
The world of Mac cloning, without the

' help of Psystar, is also alive and well. Ap-

ple might claim victory over Mac cloning
because it removed a proper corporation
from the mix, but~it will undoubtedly see

. unauthorized versions of MacOS X show

up on non-Apple hardware, despite the
settlement. ‘

Psystar appears to be legally done for:
The settlement comes after what Thom
Holwerda of OSNews called a “massive
win” for Apple.” _ .

Psystar was found to have violated

’ the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a

copyright law designed to protect intel-
lectual property from those who circum-
vent measures taken by the authors of the

_ intellectual property to prevent acts they

‘decide are unsuitable.

In other words, Apple decided that
running Macintosh OS X on non-Apple
hardware is unsuitable.

It added a license agreement to inform
users of this, as well as bits of code to
prevent users from effortlessly subverting
the license agreement.

Psystar ran afoul of the DMCA by
circumventing Apple’s efforts without
Apple’s express permission.

Some more news might come out of the
Psystar suit, as the judgment and settle-
ment were in regards to Apple’s Leopard
operating system.

A different suit, which Apple took in

Florida, references its newest operating ,

system incarnation, OS X Snow Leop-
ard. ' '
Although it seems unlikely that the
outcome will be signiﬁcantly different,
perhaps some more interesting news
points will squeeze their way out.

With early success, Naumaneyes national title-

The sophomore wrestler thrives off competition

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

4 For athletes, it’s never too early to start

dreaming big. For Tyler Nauman, a
second—year wrestler at Pitt, the big-
ger the better. Just ﬁve matches into
the year, the sophomore envisions a
monumental season.

I H Nauman, whowrestles inthe 141- I
. ‘pound weight class,  led the Pan-_‘ "
- thersthroughout the young season. , ,_

He emerged frornlast weekend’s com-
petition at Penn State with an overall
record of 16-1 andwas ranked as high
as No. 6 in his weight class in national
polls. He was also named the EWL
wrestler of the week Nov. 23.

In just his second year, Nauman
has high expectations.

“I want a national title,” Nauman
said. “I don’twant to sound cocky, but
Ifeellike I canwinitthis year. Ifeel like

everyone in there is beatable and that

I can take it.”
Nauman, who had a respectable
record of 21-6 as a redshirt freshman

. wrestling in open tournaments, has

shown improvement this season.

He accredits much of early
success to the increase in practice in-
tensity implemented by coaches, as
well as an increase inhis conditioning
regiment. He said this year’s preseason
routines were more rigorous than in
the past.

“We really stepped it up,” he

said. “Our coaches have stepped up

our practices and made them a lot
harder.” '

Though it’s commonly evidentthat
athletes need to improve in sports, the
early returns for Nauman are clear.

A wrestler since he was 5 years
old and a high school state champion,
Nauman is accustomed to winning.
Over the years, he said, he’s gained

V the con_f_idence- that drives him. It’s
‘‘ a mettle

.around'him." j ' . —
“He thinks he canwin, and that’s

the most important thing,” wrestling

head coach Rande Stottlemyer said.

 gnoti'_cea‘ble to those

‘‘He has very high goals for himself,

so you should expect him to try and
achieve those goals. He wants to
stand on the top of the podium at the
NCAAS.”

To do that, Nauman must continue
to improve.

He admitted to being less com-
fortable wrestling on his feet, and he
wants to improve his offense in that
area. He also said he must improve his
takedowns so that he can play to his
strengths, which lie in his mat skills.

But another thing might hamper
Nauman: atendencyto underestimate
his opponents. _ .

Last Sunday at the Penn State

Open, where Nauman sufferedhisﬁrst I

loss this season inthe quarterﬁnals, he

admitted to alackofrespectforhis op— -

said. “I’ll learn ﬁ'om it. I overlooked - ’

the kid.”

It didn’t sit well with Nauman,
as losing never does with the ﬁber-
competitive sophomore. .

“I hate to lose,” he said. “I’m prob-

” ably the biggest sore loser ever. I hate

losing, whether it’s in wrestling or a

 little card game.”

Stottlemyer has stressed the im-
portance of that point to the entire

team, and the ripe Nauman must learn
to regard.

“He has to pay attentionto every
match because there are a lot of good

guys out there,” Stottlemyer said.‘ “He:

needs to stay focused.” ,

Whether Nauman will do enough V

overthe course of the seasonto achieve

‘ his loﬁzy goals remains tobe seen.

From now until the NCAA champi-

Q.
onships, 16 competitions remain on

Pitt’s schedule.
V During that stretch, Nauman said
he will continue to study tapes of past

‘f matches and work on the details he

believes he must improve.

to put me above the rest,” Nauman

said. “Just train hard, and I feel like I g

Panthers seek to takebite out of Big Apple i

Men ’s basketball team set to play the Hoosiers tonight at Madison Square Garden

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt mens basketballteam showed
its inexperience with stretches of poor
playagainstDuquesne and New Hamp-
shire. .

Butthe Panthers mightregain some
of their experience when they face the
Indiana Hoosiers at Madison Square
Gardentonightatg. .

Jermaine Dixon, who has missed
the entire season thus far with a bro-

ken right foot, might play against the -

Hoosiers.

“We’ll see where he’s at,” Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon said. “And we’ll just
go fromthere.” ~

Dixon warmed up against both
Duquesne and New Hampshire but
did not play.

Pitt (7-1) played its ﬁrst eight games
of the year without its lone return-
ing starter; playing well defensively
but struggling in the offensive end at

“They’re a‘ young team,” New
Hampshire coach Bill Herrion said.

“Thefretryingtoﬁndtheirway. When

they get Dixon back  that’s going to
add so much offensively to their bas-
ketball team.”

Dixon averaged 8.4 points per game
last season for Pitt.

Jamie Dixon attributed some ofPitt’s
problems this year, not to Jermaine
Dixon’s_ injury, but to wear and tear on
other players.

“Chase [Adams] has been banged

The game on Tuesday is the latter
halfof the 15th annualjimmy V Clas-
sic, an annual doubleheader that raises
funds for cancer research. With Dixon’s-
possible return, the Panthers might
charmel past success in the event. Pitt

Pitt topples Broncos in weekend play”

The women’s basketball team is undefeated heading into tonight’s home Valparaiso match

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

In previous games, the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team has had individual players
takeccontrol on the court. But in Satur-
day’s contest against Western Michigan,
ﬁve individuals ﬁnished with double-digit
point totals.

Shayla Scott led thetearn with 16 points,
while Chelsea Cole, Taneisha Harrison,]a—
nia -Sims and,Shawnic_e ,“,Pepp'er” Wilson
contributed more._than._io points-‘each in
the 89-65 win. _, __ ‘ ' ' g   .v 3.

Pitt coach "Agnus Berenato was pleased
with the overall team effort in the Panther’s
victory.

“This was a fabulous team win for us,”

Berenato said the rebounding efforts
were disappointing, despite the fact that
Pitt out-rebounded Western Michigan 39-
38. U

“Rebounding was an issue in this game,”
Berenato said. “With our strong defensive
play, we need to capitalize off the boards.
On the offensive side, we need to set better
screens and then utilize them.”

Harrison, a junior guard, also said the
team is a work in progress, but the coaches

have a plan for success. . . .

“We have to work hard and keep working
hard in practice,” Harrison said, “arid keep

doing what‘ the coaches tell us to do. That

will make us better.” .
The Panthers will have their next oppor-

tunity to improve when they host Valparaiso

 

Whenever we can have so many players scoring
for us, it is deﬁnitely a good thing.

Agnus Berenato

Berenato said. “Whenever we can have so
many players scoring for us, it is deﬁnitely
a good thing.” ,

Pitt was able to hold a lead throughout
the entire game, a feat Berenato credited
to outstanding defensive play.

.“I feel that our defense came into the
game with great intensity,” she said. “They
were really able to impose their will on the
Western Michigan offense.”

The Panthers remain undefeated with
a 7-0 record, but both coaches and play-
ers recognize weaknesses that need to be
addressed. '

l (3-3) of the Horizon Conference tonight at

7 at the Petersen Events Center.

This contest holds a special interest
for ﬁfth—year Pitt assistant coach Caroline
McCornbs,‘who spent six seasons with the
Valparaiso team inboth the coaching and
recruiting departments.

Berenato said she anticipated this match-
up since the release of the schedule.

“We really want to get this win for [Mc-
Combs], as we take on her old team,” Be-
renato said. “This is a big game for all of
us, and we want to show our appreciation
for McCombs.”

there ended in a 65-64 overtime thriller to beat
undefeated Dukein2oo7. —
While the Panthers scored 47 points against
«New Hampshire, the Hoosiers (3-4) haven’t
struggled to make shots this year, averaging 73.4
points per game.
Maurice Creekleads the Hoosiers attack, tally-
ing16.7 points per game. Thefreshman scored at
least 14 points in every contest this season.

   

Another underclassman guard also supplies
double—digit points for Indiana. Sophomore Ver-
delljones chipped in 11.4 points per game.

Pitt guards, meanwhile, have more than
chipped in this year.

Ashton Gibbs, Brad Wanamaker and Travonf

Woodall score 56 percent of the team’s points.
Gibbs and Wanamakerboth reached new career-
high point totals against New Hampshire.

“We ran a lot of sets for them [against New

I Hampshire] ,”_]amie Dixon said. “Theywere very

patient and waited for their shots.” _
Down low, Indiana parks 6—foot-9 forward

Christian Watford under the rim for 12.6 points -

per ‘contest. Watford pulls down almost seven
rebounds per game, aswell. ’

The Indiana freshman will compete against
Gary McGhee and Dante Taylor. Taylor continues
to improve as the year continues, his coach said.

Dixon said. “He was on the glass, and we hit him
in transition one time. Things are coming along
just ﬁne.”

Indiana entered the season chosen to ﬁnish

No. 10 in the Big 10 by Sporting News. Defense ~

has been an issue for the Hoosiers, who enter the
classic off an 80-68 loss to Maryland.
Defense hasn’t been an issue for Pitt, though.
The Panthers have heldtheir opponents to 60

points against up to 55.6 per game.

Dixon said he sees the 15-7 first half against
New Hampshire as a defensive accomplishment
rather thananoffensive debacle. _

“I don’t remember the last time I was a part
of a 1ow—scoring ﬁrst  the one we had,”
he said. “I’d like to think it was a credit to good
defense.”

“I don’tknow how manyteams have had eight
