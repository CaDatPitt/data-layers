GSPIA remembers City cop,
part-time graduate student

By Mark Gordon
and Jackie Duggan
The Pitt News

An off—duty" City police officer and
part-time Pitt student was shot and
killed last -Friday while walking near
his home with his daughter.

Police said James "‘Rip” Taylor, a
student in the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
was ambushed by a possible gang
member after Taylor, a traffic division

sergeant, confronted youths who"

were painting gang graffiti on a side-
walk. ‘

The suspect grabbed Taylor’s gun and
shot him five times after the initial fight
by the sidewalk. Taylor died of multiple
gunshot wounds to the head, neck and
chest.

Martin Staniland, interim dean of
GSPIA, wrote a letter expressing his
feelings but did not wish to comment
further.

In the letter, Staniland said Taylor
was within a couple of courses of
completing his graduate degree. Taylor
was very enthusiastic about his
school work and hoped to take up
an administrative position in a

Secret tunnels, doors on campus

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

E. Maxine Bruhns’ baby pillow is hid-
den in a secret room somewhere on the
Pitt campus. It should still be there, unless
the ghost of Mary Schenley found it and
took it to Bruce Hall.

Though Pitt may be viewed by outsiders
as a typical university, beneath the surface
lies nostalgic old stadiums, trap doors,
tunnels and, believe it or not, ghosts.

“There is a secret door in the Croghan-
Schenley room behind the fireplace. We
think that’s where the ghost of Mary

Schenley stays,” said Bruhns, director of
the Nationality Rooms. “No one has actu-
ally seen her, but some have heard
music.”

A university employee at Bruce Hall
said that cafeteria workers will not go into
the Schenley room alone at night.

The room was a Schenley family dona-
tion and is the actual room Mary
Schenley’s father had built for her wed-
ding day party. Mary Schenley eloped and
moved to Guyana, leaving the room

unused.

The Schenley house was sold in 1951,

Power at Pitt
reflects Great  
Chain of Being

By Anthony Breznican

0 Staff Writer

(Editor's note: This is the first part of
a two—part series on faculty gover-
ttarzce groups at Pitt.)

Put into the most elementary terms, a
university helps you understand
things. 4

But in the process, a university can
become a difficult mechanism to
understand in itself.

Recently, there have been questions
about the efficiency of that mechanism
—— what the different bodies of gover-
nance do and how they interact.

“It’s like the Great Chain of Being,"
said the president of the University
Senate, Keith McDuffie.

“This university is set up so that
you have trustees, and there resides
the legal governance of the universi-
ty,” he said. “The chancellor is
appointed by them, and everybody else
on down the line, including the vice-
chancellor, the provost and then the
faculty and staff.”

However, within any large organiza-
tion of people, there are going to be
matters of disagreement. The adminis-
tration at Pitt is no different.

“You have an entire university, and
a question of how it will be governed."
said Christina Paulston. member
of both the Faculty Assembly and
Senate Council. “Who is going to

Pitt philosophy ranks high

By Jennifer Haluska
F or The Pitt News

Pitt’s philosophy department has recent-
ly been ranked second in the nation by the
National Research Council, with Princeton
University coming in first

In the 1980s the department was ranked
third by the NRC, falling behind Princeton
and Harvard universities.

“It feels pretty good to be ranked just
below Princeton and Harvard one time and
come out above Harvard the next,” said
Robert Brandom, chair of the philosophy
department

The National Research Council evalu-
ates all universities in the nation which
have a doctoral program in philosophy.
The four—year study included a look at
3,634 academic programs at 274 institu-
tions. Over 8,000 faculty members partici-
pated in the evaluations.

Other departments at Pittranked among
the top third nationally, including Pitt’s
programs in chemistry, economics,
English‘, history, physics, physiology, psy-
chology and political science.

The NRC examined the overall quality
and effectiveness of the graduate pro-

grams, the subjective reputations of the
departments and teaching effectiveness.

Although the philosophy department has
been in existence since the beginning of
the university, it wasn’t until the early
1960s that then-Dean Edward Litchfield
began to build a “spire of academic excel-
lency.” According to Brandom, Litchﬁeld
set out to ﬁnd some of the best professors
and faculty members in the world for Pitt’s
philosophy department.

One of the first professors to join the
faculty, Adolf Grunbaum, is still with the
university today. Graduates of the doctor-
ate program usually go on either to teach
or conduct research at a university, while
graduates of the undergraduate program
enter into many different ﬁelds. The phi-
losophy department currently has 55 grad-
uate students and 82 undergraduate stu-
dents enrolled.

Pitt was also ranked second in a 1993
report entitled “The Philosophical
Gourmet Report,” tying with Harvard in its
graduate program but again falling short to
Princeton.

The Gourmet Report comes out every
few years, while‘ the NRC results are pub-
lished every 10 years.

Artist inspires
By Dave Anderson

The World of Lois Mailou Jones,
an internationally known African-
American artist, opened to Pitt on
Sept. 6 in the Frick Fine Arts
Gallery.

The exhibit, originally planned to
run for only threeiyears, is now in
its fifth year and is scheduled to end
in Kingstown, Jamaica, in 1996. It is
open to the public Tuesday to
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and
will be at the University Art Gallery
until Oct. 15.

It contains 50 original works,
including oils, watercolors, draw-
ings and textile designs.

The exhibit was organized by
Meridian International Center and is
being sponsored through the office
of the vice chancellor for student
and public affairs.

According to Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student and public
affairs, the decision to bring the
Jones exhibit to Pitt was made by

university.

Images strives to bring local
African-American artists’ works to
attention — Jones is only the third

featured. -

“Everyone asked the same thing
— ‘do you think we can get her?”’
said Haley, a member of Images,

brought up. “The university is very

Ruth Richardson, a retired social

Assembly

°From page 1
have a word to say something? So you have
the University Senate. which meets once a
term."

The Faculty Assembly evolved as a repre-
sentative for the faculty at large.

“Since every full—time member of the fac-
ulty is a member of the [University] Senate,
you have this huge senate, but you haven’t
got a lot of interest.” McDuffie said. “You
haven’t got people attending all the meet-
ings. There was relatively little interest, I

g would say, because it was so large, and

rather anonymous.

“So the Faculty Assembly was an attempt
to pare down one of the parts of the Senate
into a functioning body that, at least, would
be able to attract those people who are inter-
ested in doing something.”

Representatives from the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, the professional schools and
the schools of the health sciences are elected
for terms of three years. Elections are
arranged so that one—third of Assembly
members’ terms run out each year. The
members are limited to two terms.

“It’s a very outspoken body of people on
the whole,” McDuffie said. “They’re the
ones who are really interested.”

Members of the Faculty Assembly meet
to discuss faculty concerns. which leads to
an expression of the faculty position on cer-

tain issues. Committees are formed, resolu-
tions put forth and votes are taken on them.
All of this is a very involved and tedious
process, the result of which has no legal
weight.

“Anything that the Faculty Assembly does
has no binding  no effect, no real power,”
Paulston said. “[The Assembly] occasionally
makes motions ‘of various kinds, and they get
passed on to Senate Council, and then Senate
Council will vote on it.”

Much as the Faculty Assembly acts as
a down—sized representation of the faculty,
the Senate Council acts as a down—sized
University Senate. The bylaws of the
University Senate define it‘ as “a principal
mechanism for the faculty, the administra-
tion, staff and the student body to seek con-
sensus on policies and practices of universi-
ty—wide concern.”

The Senate Council is presided over by the
president of the University Senate,
McDuffie, and contains representatives from
the Student Government Board, staff, faculty
and administration.

To be a member of Senate Council, a facul-
ty member must serve on Faculty Assembly
for at least one year. The remaining two
years of the term are served on both bodies.

(Tomorrow: Faculty members analyze their
role during this time of transition.)

Crowell said she selected
these individuals because she
felt they best represented the
student body.

The formation of a recycling
committee was also discussed
at last night’s meeting. The
committee is being started to
increase recycling in student
housing. There will be an open
meeting Wednesday at 8 p.m.
outside of the SGB office on
the sixth floor of the William
Pitt Union.

“There is no recycling being
done in some dorms,” said
Julie Clouse, board member.
“In others there are bins for
aluminum and paper. But even
then other waste gets mixed in
sometimes.”

The money raised by the
recycling will go to buy more

design, and you can feel it.”

Another pupil of Jones’
who later became a teacher
is Meredith Young, who
teaches art at Holy Rosary in
Pittsburgh. Young studied
under Jones at Howard for
four years in the ‘60s and
early ‘70s.

“She was fun and full of
exciting stories about her
travels," Young said. “But as
an instructor, she was stern.”

According to Young, in the
hall Jones was full of energy,
even bubbly, but in the class—
room she was a no—nonsense
professor who took art very
seriously.

“When she came into the
room you could her a pin
drop,” Young said. “We con-
sidered her a master.”

Young said feels Jones was
important to her own life and
art.

“I feel very fortunate to
have met her,” she said.
“She’s been a wonderful role
model, and I appreciate the
discipline.”

when Pitt acquired and re-built several
of the rooms on the campus. Complete
re-assembly of the Schenley room was
finished in 1979.

One of Pitt’s major attractions is the
Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of
Learning, but Bruhns said these histori-
cal rooms hold more than just art and
culture.

“If you can find the secret latch

"located somewhere in the early

‘American room, it will open up a hid-
den loft with a bed. My baby pillow
sits on that bed,” said Bruhns.

Finding the latch is something like a
scene from an Indiana Jones movie,
where a piece of the room is moved
and a door opens. Bruhns said there is
also a light switch hidden in a knothole
of the wood walls.

University policy allows anyone to
look for these hidden items, but since
the room contains riﬂes and other dan-
gerous items, exploration can only be
done during a guided tour.

Bruhns. also said there is a time cap-
sule inside the Cathedral’s cornerstone
which contains newspapers and other
information relating to 1937, the year
the cornerstone was laid.

said Harvey White, Taylor’s
advisor at GSPIA.’ “He

get the school more

Both Staniland’s letter and
White said Taylor was an
asset to GSPIA because he
was able to relate his police
work within the community
to his classes.

“He was able to talk about
what it was like to protect
the community,” White said.
“He embellished the school
by his presence.”

‘White said he feels the

‘ shooting death of Taylor is a

reflection of the problems
society is facing. This is
because City police believe
the individual who shot
Taylor is affiliated with a
gang. -

“It expresses how the
community is suffering,”
White said. “Here is a
person trying to make a
difference, in the prime
of his life, and he is cut
down.”

Staniland said Taylor was
colorful and different. “He
engaged easily and warmly
with others and quickly
gained the affection of all
who knew him.”

White said students in
GSPIA have taken the
initiative to collect funds
for the family, and
Staniland said there is a
memorial book in the
dean’s office which faculty
and students can sign this

will only give hints to its location.
Like the hidden doors, Pitt also has

secrets that run underground.

“Oh sure, there are tunnels,” said a
Pitt maintenance worker. “They lead
from Forbes Quad to the Towers. There
are other ones too, but no students have
access to them.”

Hidden tunnels are common at most
older universities, and “tunneling” is a

making it the oldest building still in

At the time of construction the build-

from a dairy farm, but it evolved into
“a social center for the leisured upper-
class.”

The hotel in its original form was
visited by several U.S. presidents and
foreign dignitaries, and a sample hotel

ﬂoor of the union.

A place to call home

If you don’t like living in the dorm, you might not have a place
to call home in a few years if a few prominent Oaklanders have
their way. According to yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the
residential portion of the Oakland community is not at all happy
with the ﬂood of students moving into the formerly residential
area. '

The main area of focus for the proposed redistribution of peo-
ple is South Oakland. Once a blue-collar, residential neighbor-
hood peppered with various ethnic cultures, the area below
Forbes Avenue has become a haven for undergraduate students.
One couple which has lived there for 44 years told the PG that
those students have caused a serious decline in living conditions.

Several proposals have been made by Oakland’s community
groups, Pitt and the city Planning Department to return South
Oakland to the residential neighborhood it once was. They intend
to try to “encourage” (read: force) students to move back into on-
campus housing or move to another area. What they have not
mentioned is how they intend to do this.

Among the proposals which do offer some specifics on relocat-
ing students was the city’s directive for Pitt to come up with a
plan to increase available on-campus housing by 1,100 beds
within five years. Pitt’s proposed plan includes a proposal for
500 beds in new residence halls on Fifth Avenue where Burger
King used to be and near Pitt Stadium. Pitt has also said it will
encourage fraternities to build more housing on campus. Other
proposed plans include stricter enforcement of city housing
codes and requiring landlords to improve their rental properties
for use by graduate students and families.

The PG also mentions attempts to have undergrads “steered
away from residential streets, where transient lifestyles” discour-
age families from moving in. It is absolutely ridiculous to
assume that students can be “steered away” from living in resi-
dential areas. Adding on—carnpus housing will not help anything
if a student finds it cheaper, more convenient or more pleasant to
live in an apartment.

In the PG article, Attilio and Alicia Bellisario complain that
students cause more noise, garbage and rude behavior on the
streets of South Oakland. While they may be right, and students
might show a little more respect for other people who live in the
neighborhood, that does not give anyone the right to discriminate
against undergraduate students.

What the Bellisarios and others like them do not consider is the
myriad reasons why students choose to live in residential neigh-
borhoods. Many students move to apartments because they are
assigned to live with totally incompatible roommates in the
dorms. Others like the ability to cook their own food instead of
having to purchase a meal plan. Others choose to rent because it
can be drasticallycheaper than living in the dorms. For whatever
reason students choose to rent an apartment, neither the commu-
nity groups, the city or the university should have the right to tell
undergraduate students where they can and can't live.

It is illegal to base housing availability on race, gender, ethnic-
ity or any other grouping. Forcing students to leave areas like
Semple, Meyran and Atwood Streets (or denying housing to stu-
dents in those areas) based on their status as undergraduates is
discrimination, pure and simple.

difference between Limbaugh’s
program and “news” papers is
the American people know that
Limbaugh’s program is opinion.
It is rather humorous that we
call the people who write these
articles “reporters,” while Rush,
after writing two books filled
with facts, is called an author.
The title of reporter gives the
American people more reason
to trust them to report the news.
What they are doing to the
American public is similar to
the Milli Vanilli scandal. The
only difference is that the media
have not been caught —- yet.
Coming from a suburban
community, which only offers
one local paper, I have seen the
liberal media in action. Our
paper, The Laviqton Constitution
(like many papers) offers an
editorial section leading the
reader to believe that this is the
only section, besides the adver-
tising section, that will offer
opinion. I have seen this notion
proved wrong repeatedly. A

week before the 1994 elections, ‘

I read an article (which was not
in the editorial section) entitled,
“Oklahoma " needs Dave
McMurdy.” Thanks for the
facts. Rather silly, wouldn’t you
agree?

More shocking is the fact that
these “news” stories can be
found in even larger communi-
ties and papers. Luckily, the
voters in Lawton saw through
the paper’s attempted brain-
washing and voted McMurdy
out of office. However, the
result in the past has not been as
positive. Unfortunately, before
the ‘92 election many
Americans believed the “news”
and media coverage on Bill
Clinton. (Oh well, if it weren’t
for good ol’ Bubba we might
not have taken over Congress
so easily.)

How is the average American
to know what is truth and what
is opinion? Few communities
know that there is not much
political truth in their local
papers. Some communities
have no opposition to many

ideas. This is one reason that
certain countries are surpassing
the United States in education
and other areas. To find the
solution to a problem one must
know both sides, and many
times the media do not offer
that. However, when used in
conjunction with debate and
argument, not only will both
sides be told, but one is offered
the opportunity to make an edu-
cated decision about which side
has the more sound solution (or
even develop one of his own).

Without debate and argument
there would be no way to pro-
tect this country from
Scoundrels. We would only
have looks and popularity to
base elections on. By the use of
debate, we weed out those who
would only use their positions
for senseless self-advancement.
If it were not for the debate and
argument we already put to use
in society, we would not have
had the Emancipation
Proclamation. To protect soci-
ety from the faults in media and
communications, I offer a sim-
ple solution. For every article or
“news” story that expresses an
opinion, there should be one
expressing the opposing view.
With this change, society would
truly grow. Using this adapta-
tion, the United States would
truly become a freer country,
and the First Amendment
would reach its highest level.

The media can be a detrimen-
tal force. The media could be
used for mass brainwashing
much like Hitler did in Europe.
There are many ways that
media are currently detrimental,
such as the way they do not
allow both sides of the story to
reach the public, not allowing
people to make decisions based
on fact or personal opinion.
Today, in a world saturated with
liberal media and communica-
tion, the art of debate and argu-
ment plays an important role in
our future.

nist for The Pitt News.

Seton Hall shuts ouiPiH', 2-0

By Connie Nigro
For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team is no longer
undefeated in Big East play after losing
2-0 to nationally ranked Seton Hall on
Saturday afternoon. The loss drops
Pitt’s record to 4-3 overall and 2-1 in
the conference.

Eight-hundred and seven anxious soc-
cer fans gathered at Owen T. Carroll
Field, home of the Seton Hall Pirates.
The fans, however, had to wait awhile
before having anything to cheer about.
Through 67 minutes of soccer action,
the game remained scoreless, until
Seton Hall broke the silence. A ﬂurry in
front of the bench and a failed clearing
attempt by Pitt allowed Seton Ha1l’s
Michael Magarinos to score an unassist-
ed goal.

“No one could clear it. No one could
get it out,” said junior marking back
Mike-Dyer. 7

Magarinos’ goal proved to be the
game winner, but he wasn’t satisfied.
Twelve minutes later, Magarinos scored
an insurance goal for Seton Hall as he
headed in a free kick by Bill Deftos.

At 81:56, Seton Ha1l’s Jeremy Cohen
was ejected from the game after receiv-
ing his second yellow card. This gave
Pitt a man advantage. The Panthers
failed to capitalize on the advantage.

“We lost our composure. Seton Hall
kept theirs,” Panther head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “There were a lot of
stupid, needless fouls. Both teams were
emotional and chippy.”

A lack of scoring remains the alba-
tross around the neck of the Pitt soccer
team. A

“We’re not scoring many goals. We’re
still looking for that one person with the
hot hand to put it in,” Luxbacher said.

Pitt’s offense wasn’t exactly nd‘n—exis—
tent. The Panthers registered 13, shots

ence game last weekend.

on Pirates goalie Eric Shaw. Senior mid-
fielder Jeff Porter and freshman forward
Phil Matilla each had three shots on
goal. Senior forward Todd Graf had two
shots on goal. The scoring attempts
were there; it’s the goals that were not.

Pitt’s defense played a strong game
despite the loss; The Pirates had five
shots blocked by Panther defenders. Pitt
goalie Adam Spitzer came up with
seven saves, compared to Shaw’s four.

“Adam played well,” Luxbacher said.

As a team, the Panthers put forth
another solid effort. They just let it slip
away in the second half. \

“We played well in the first half, we just
got out of our game in the second half,”
Luxbacher said. “We played individuals
instead of playing our game.”

The Panthers knew going into the
game that Seton Hall was achallenge.
Coach Luxbacher said Seton Hall would
be Pitt’s toughest opponent to date.
Considering Seton Hall's national rank,
Pitt fared well and held their own. A
win is always nice, but the loss wasn’t
very devastating.

“They’re ranked 20th in the nation,”

Women /eaive competition in
dust at Ma/one Invitational

By Geoff Moak
For The Pitt News

. What a difference a year can
make. In Ross Perot-like fash-
ion, Pitt cross country. coach
Dave Sobal produced pages of
statistics — times and places -
to show how much better Pitt
ran at the 1995 Malone College
Cross Country Invitational last
Saturday than at the 1994 meet
on the same course in Canton,
Ohio.

“Amy Francy gets excited
aboutthis race because she’s
from Ohio and she gets to run in
front of friends and family, and
she still was 30 seconds faster
than last year,” Sobal said.

Francy came in eighth place
with a time of 19:16. Kim
Rosenberger of Youngstown
State won the race in 18:15.

The improvements didn’t stop
there. Stacy Anderson came in
second place with a time of
18:31, 1:23 faster than last year.
Stephanie Ellsworth (19:27)
chopped 1:26 off of her time.
For the men, Ed Adamson
(26:51) improved by 44 sec-
onds, and Matt Samuel (27:07)

was 1:01 faster than a year ago.

And Sobal thinks there may
be more improvement where
that came from. “If we could go
back and run there in a month, I
think we could go 30 seconds
faster,” Sobal said.

All of this improvement
translated into “a good perfor-
mance,” according to Sobal.
“We had an idea of what the
competition would be like,” he
said. “We knew IUP would be
tough. Youngstown State won
the meet last year, so we ﬁgured
they were the team to beat.”

Pitt did beat them, and the rest
of the field as well. The women
won the meet, scoring 38 points
with the help of some new
names among the top runners.
Angie Martin was Pitt’s second
ﬁnisher, sixth overall, in 19:06.

“She’s doing better than she
was about two weeks ago,”
Sobal said. “She always goes
out fast. Her and Stacy
[Anderson] led the race for a
while.”

Sobal was also impressed
with Anna Kohler. .

“At the two-mile mark, -she
was in 22nd place, and she

the

ended up in 14th. Usually
there’s no change in the last
mile of the race, but she made
something happen.”

Like the women, the men also
faced good competition.

“Hi1lsdale was the number
three team in the NAIA last

year, and Malone always has a /

strong team,” Sobal said.

Unlike the women, the men
were not successful in overcom-
ing their competition and fin-
ished third with 56 points, six
behind Malone and 14 behind
Hillsdale.

“The guys were disappointed,
but it didn’t break their hearts,”
Sobal said. “We knew we faced
some tough teams.”

All was not lost for the men.
After all, the winner of the race,
Ira Wentworth of Malone, only
tied the course record of 24:51.
Pitt’s Frank Nesko came in sec-
ond in 25:02. Several of Pitt’s
other runners are returning to
top form. Julio Ortez appears to
be recovered from a sore leg he
was nursing last week.

Pitt lands
top nose
tackle

Pitt received an oral commit-
ment from Penn Hills High
School defensive lineman
Demond Gibson on Saturday.

Gibson, considered one of the
top defensive linemen in the
state, told Panther offensive
coordinator Ken Karcher of his
decision before Pitt’s 54-14 loss
to Ohio State.

The 6-foot-4, 300-pound nose
tackle also doubles as an offen-
sive tackle. Super Prep maga-
zine ranks him in the top 25
defensive linemen in the coun-
try, while The National
Recruiting Advisor ranks him in
the top 10 nose guards.

Gibson chose Pitt because he
believes that he has the chance
to play early.

Gibson is the eighth player
from Western Pennsylvania to
commit to Pitt and is the
Panthers’ ninth recruit so far.

Pitt landed Gibson over Ohio
State, Michigan, Syracuse,
Boston College and West
Virginia, among others.

By Geoff Moak
For The Pitt News

One might expect a fresh-
man to be a little bit nervous
and shy in his ﬁrst few weeks
at college, but Julio Ortez is an
extreme case, even for a fresh-
man.

How quiet has he been? Pitt
cross country coach Dave
Sobal didn’t even know that
Ortez won the New Jersey

state cross country champi- ,

onship last year, and Ortez was
reluctant to admit it when
asked about his high school
career. Even when he did, he
concentrated on what could
have been better.

“I ran 16:15 there,” Ortez
said. “It was a half-mile uphill
to the finish, so all thetimes
were slow.”

Growing up in Hoboken,
N.J., Ortez never thought
much about running. His first
sport was basketball. He

but realized he was not going
to be quite as good as Scottie
Pippen of the Chicago Bulls,
his favorite player. In his
freshman year, Ortez was cut
from the Hoboken High
School basketball team. But he’
didn’t give himself much time
to worry about the setback.

“My brother ran track in
high school, so after I got cut
from the basketball team, I
would start going to practices
with him,” Ortez said. “The
coach saw me run, and she
encouraged me to join the

The rest, as they say, is his-

schools such as the University
of Michigan and Penn State.
Academics, though, brough
Ortez to Pitt. ~

“I wanted to major in pre-
med, and Pitt has one of the
best pre-med programs, so I
came here,” Ortez said.

There are stark contrasts
between «high school and col-
lege cross country, according
to Ortez, and there are adjust-
ments to make. Obviously, the
competition is tougher at the
college level.

“The level is much higher
here than in high school. But I
was expecting that,” Ortez
said. “I’m not surprised.”

What has surprised Ortez are
the differences in race strategy.

“Races go out faster. And
they start to pick up with about
a mile to go, not a half-mile
like in high school.”

An increased race distance
has been another new twist for
Ortez to get accustomed to.

The distance of a college cross
country race is longer — 5
miles, as opposed to only 5
kilometers (just over 3 miles)

in high school.

“Last week at Miami, I knew
when I hit the three-mile mark.
I could feel it,” Ortez said with
the smile of someone who has
learned a lesson. “But if you
just stay controlled and stay
focused, it shouldn’t matter.
The extra two miles aren’t
much.”

Saturday’s race at Schenley
Park was proof of that for
Ortez. Despite spending much
of the week before the race
with a sore leg, Ortez was
Pitt’s fourth finisher, in 25:38.

“It’s a tough course, lots of

hills,” Ortez noted as he

looked up Flagstaff Hill, the
long hill that runners climb at
the very beginning of the race.
In addition to cross country,
Ortez plans to run on the track
team for Pitt as well, hopefully

The Pitt News, 'Iluesda , Se tember 26, 1995

feet do the talking

competing in the _3,000 and
5,000 meters. But the task at
hand for now is cross country.
Thanks to a strong work
ethic, Ortez came to college
ready for the extra two miles,
whether they mattered or not.
Preparing for the longer dis-
tance of college racing, Ortez

routinely ran eight miles a day

over the summer.

“In high school, my longest

run was seven miles. That was
tough,” Ortez said. “But I
came here in shape. There’s
just some things I’ve still got
to get used to.”
0 If Ortez’s reaction to one of
those things, his new coach, is
any indication, he’s well on his
way to a successful career here
at Pitt.

“I like the coach. He’s dif-
ferent from my old coach. He
has us do a lot more mileage,”
Ortez said. “We did more
speed work in high school.”

Coach Sobal is happy with
Ortez too.

“Julio is very quiet; never a
problem,” Sobal said. “I’m
really ‘pleased with everything
he’s done — practices, races,
everything. In the grand
scheme of the season, today
(Saturday) was minor, so I told
him to take it easy with his
leg, and he still hung tough. I
think he’s going to do just
fine.”

He may not tell you so him-
self, but Julio Ortez is certain-
ly off to a fine start.

Cross

[Kuntz].”

Kuntz and Ortez finished in a
pack of four runners within one
second of each other, in 25:29
and 25:30, respectively.

Much to the delight of Sobal.
Ed Adamson also returned
from an injury suffered during
last spn'ng’s track season.

“It’s good to see Ed rounding *'

into shape,” Sobal said.

Those runners will have an
extra week to take care of their
injuries, as the Panthers have
this weekend off before head-
ing to Ohio University on Oct.
7.

“That’s the first meet I’m
really trying to get them excited
about,” Sobal said. “Hopefully,
we’ll get a better idea of where
we match up.”

The month of September has
been a “pre-competitive sea-
son” according to Sobal, a time
to get into shape and prepare
for the really important races.

“We have a test at Ohio, then
another low—key meet, then we
start the Big East races,” Sobal
said. “In cross country, we have
the luxury of year-end champi-
onships, so it’s not like other
sports where the whole season
matters.”

If the Panthers keep showing
the kind of improvement they
displayed on Saturday, that

- could be a very big luxury

indeed.

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 26, 1995

Column

‘From page 7

before leaving the game in
the second quarter. Are you
keeping track of this?

Freshman Ahman Green
had 111 yards and two touch-
downs. Green and sophomore
James Sims played all of the
second half, along with most
of the Nebraska subs.

How can a reserve sit back
and watch the starter dance
all over the field the entire
first half scoring at will and
not want to go out and do the
same when he gets his
chance?

In the big picture of Top 10
routs, Rutgers coach Doug
Graber is now likely to join
the ranks of the whiners after
his team’s 59-24 loss to Penn
State. That damn Joe Paterno
again, he’s such a demon.

A pesky Rutgers team hung
around all game against
Paterno’s Nittany Lions this
past Saturday. Penn State
finally pulled away in the
fourth, and redshirt freshman
Mike McQueary came in to
replace Lion QB Wally
Richardson. McQueary will
likely sit behind Richardson
for the next two years before
he gets his shot at the starting
job, and Paterno knows that. —

Graber was livid when
McQueary hooked up with
tight end Chris Campbell ,
from 42 yards out late in the

‘ fourth. Lousy coverage com-

bined with awesome PSU
depth resulted in that TD. It
was not a no-class act; in
fact, Patemo is one of the
most honorable coaches in
the land. Graber thought so
too, but that changed quickly.

Cameras caught Graber and
his little expletives, and it
was easy to read his lips.
After the game Graber met
Paterno at midfield and told
JoePa that he did not think
Patemo was like that. Feisty
little Paterno responded with
an “Aaaaaahhhhh, bullshit”
for Graber, and the rest was
ESPN history.

Ron Dickerson, coach of
Temple, did not act like a
baby the week before when
PSU mauled his squad 66-14.
Dickerson understands the
talent that these teams have
and how they stack up
against teams like his that
have little talent.

I wish that all bad teams
would shut up and count their
money after a weekend when
they play a Florida State or
Penn State. If a team like
Central Florida or Pacific
goes up against fellow-cup-
cakes week in and week out,
the programs will die.

These Top 10 teams are not
going to slow down. So the
Doug Grabers of the world
should allow that to sink into
their thick skulls. Shut up,
play the game and start think-
ing about playing teams
worse than you once in a
while so you can return the
favor.

Matt Grove is a columnist for
The Pitt News.

°From page 7
Dyer said. “They’re a good
team. so we’re not so disap-
pointed with the loss.”
The Panthers are looking
forward to playing a home

game after a four—game road
trip.

“lt’s good to be at home
and get dressed in your own
field house,” Luxbacher said.
“Traveling gets to be a drag.”
