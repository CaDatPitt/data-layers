Two Pitt football players arrested for brawl C

A late-nightlbrawl at the Original

Hotdog Shop resulted in the arrest of two.

Pitt football players and aprofessional
player and the hospitalization of at least
two police officers.

All—Big East offensive lineman Reuben
Brown, who was arrested and then
cleared of drug charges earlier this semes-

Sean Gilbert, Los Angeles Rams star and
former Pitt defensive tackle, was also

According to city police, the fracas
began when Brown, Gilbert and first—year
Pitt player Jon McCray blocked the stair-
well at the back of the Original, not
allowing a woman to go upstairs.

When the woman complained, the man-
ager sent an off—duty city police officer
who works as an Original security guard
to confront the men. The guard, Officer
David Proctor, ordered the men to leave
and they jumped him, according to
Sergeant Robert Connolly.

The fight moved outside when other
officers arrived. After the three suspects

M01/mt Graham report
has Pitt reviewing options

By Beth Kovaly
Asst. News Editor

Yet another chapter in the

unfolding Mount Graham pro-
ject controversy was revealed
at yesterday’s University Senate
meeting.

Reports that were released

last week indicating a cover-up

on “possibly illegal” aspects of
the debated telescope project
were brought before the coun-
cil in the final minutes of its
meeting.

The reports center-on a 5-
year-old study commissioned
by the University of Arizona’s
president to reevaluate the
effectiveness of the telescope
site.

But articles appearing in
Arizona newspapers charge
that several portions of the
report were withheld from the
UA’s Board of Regents before a

‘crucial vote on its continued

involvement in the project.

Parts left out included the
possibility that the fund—raising
approach being used for the
multimillion dollar project was
“unduly complicated, risky and
possibly illegal,” and that “a
new approach is required to
ensure success.” ,

The Regents voted 8-2 con-
firming the UA’s commitment
to the project, -although they
received less than half of the
40—page report, according to
Arizona newspapers.

Pitt is considering investing
in the project to build the tele-
scope on the mountain but has
faced opposition from activists
protesting the site’s environ-
mental and religious conflicts.

Yesterday, members of Pitt’s
Student Environmental Action
Coalition (SEAC) asked Senate
members for a reaction to the
possibility of illegal funding.

University Senate President
James Holland said the project
may very well be turned down
on the grounds that the Mount
Graham location is a poor spot
for a telescope.

Pitt’s Business and Finance
Vice Chancellor Ben Tuchi later
said that Pitt is involved with
the project only on a specula-
tive basis. V

“There are four potential tele-
scope projects that the univer-
sity is looking at,” he said.
“One possibility is Mount
Graham.”

He added that though there
are four possible scopes of
interest, Pitt may not choose to
invest in any of them.

“The only tie [to Mount
Graham] would be in the sense
of our academic community
being aware of the project or
finding it interesting. But as for
specific ties, none,” Tuchi said.

As for cover-up speculations,
Tuchi said that without having
seen the report or having

talked with the Arizona

Sharing your secrets proves good for your health CORRECTION

The ability to confide in
another trusted person has
long been thought to be an
asset to good emotional
health. Expressions such as
“confession is good for the

. soul” and “getting things off

your chest” exemplify this
folklore. Recent research
provides some evidence that
“opening up” is a healthy
thing to do. Dr. James
Pennebaker from Southern
Methodist University con-
ducted a four-year study on
the consequences of sharing
and not sharing one’s
secrets. He found clear evi-

.dence that keeping certain

kinds of secrets frequently
has unhealthy consequences.
People, for instance, who
were unable to talk with oth-
ers about traumatic experi-
ences such as the loss of a
loved one or sexual victim-
ization, had a significantly
greater incidence of prob-
lems with blood pressure,
insomnia, psychological
well-being and immune sys-
tem functioning than did

those who were able to
share their concerns.
Another ‘interesting finding
was that there.were direct
health benefits to opening
up even when people just
write anonymously about

Those who benefitted the
most by this writing experi-
ment were those who had
not previously talked about
their secrets to anyone. It
was also noted that this tech-
nique was most effective

studies Pennebaker asked
people to write about their
most traumatic experiences
for 15 minutes a day. The
individuals who wrote about

events, as compared to sub-
jects who wrote on more
superficial topics, showed

of physiological indexes that

decreased by 50 percent.

about their emotional reac-
tions to the trauma.

These findings are interest-
ing but not particularly sur-
prising to people who work
in the mental health field.
One of the most beneficial
things that people get from
seeking counseling, for
example, is not the advice
they are given but the
release they get from telling
their story and sharing their
fears in a confidential set-

ting. Similar benefits can be
obtained by becoming more
open with other trusted peo-
ple in your life. . This
does not mean pouring out
all the most intimate details
of your life to anyone with
an open ear. It does mean,
however, that you need to
pay attention when you feel
“bound up” or emotionally
stressed by secrets that seem
to weigh heavier on you
with each passing month or
year.

Use good judgement,
but try to find people in
your life whom that you can
trust to help carry your
secret burdens. If you are
not ready to do this, try the
experiment that Pennebaker
suggests, and spend some
time each day writing (in
your private journal) those
thoughts and feelings that
are so hard to share with
anyone else.

Even “self” confession can
be good for your soul and
for your mind and body as
well.

Pitts Graduate and Professional
Student Association is pleased with
the recent shuttle expansion, but the
group is still concerned about the
transportation/safety $30 fee.

GPSA said that the new transporta-
tion system’s purpose of providing
students with a safer environment
has yet to be accomplished.

A GPSA report stated that there is
little connection between the time
the shuttles are offered and when
crimes occur.

“It is also unclear how the shuttle
enhances security since its peak rid-
ership is at 4:50 in the afternoon”
when few crimes occur, the report
stated.

It also stated that “the shuttle can-
not attract significant ridership. Only
a few students receive any possible
security benefit.”

Data from the Department of
Transportation said that the daily
average of students riding the shut-

GPSA questions effectiveness

tles is 3,553 —— but GPSA questions
the data because “it does not control
for individuals who ride the shuttle”
more than one time a day.

Another problem GPSA has with 4

this fee is that it is “indistinguishable
from tuition.”

“Read as a tuition increase, the
proposed fee represents an addition-
al tuition increase of 1.16 percent for
undergraduates and .74 percent for
graduate students, based on $60 for
two terms,” the statement read.

GPSA has proposedgthree recom-
mendations to clarify the situation:

-The administration should recog-

' nize the fee as a tuition increase.

-The shuttle service should - be
recognized as a trans- por-
tation plan, and campus safety
should be addressed through other
initiatives.

°Pitt must be accountable to the
students and mask tuition increases
through fees.

GPSA will be sending its report to
the administration and will address it
at the next Senate Council meeting.

Raps and  
show tunes
bring Greeks
to their thrones

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Debz Kavaler took her own
message to heart last night
when she stepped in front of
an excited crowd and sang,
“On My Own” from the
Broadway musical Les
Miserables. Less than an hour
later she stepped forward to
receive the crown for Greek
Goddess, the Pitt Greeks’
highest individual social

award in one of the closest
competitions ever.

 

“Did I win? I still can’t
believe it,” said Kava1er,‘a
member of Delta Delta Delta.

,“I’ve been so nervous for

about the last month. I put a
lot of effort into my singing
but mostly to avoid embar-
rassment, I never thought this
would happen.”

David Maron, a brother of
Phi Delta Theta, proved that a
show tune style was not the
only way to. become a Greek
deity by finishing as Greek
God with his original “Blow
Me Bazooka Joe” rap.

Maron and his group, the
Lapflounders, worked the
crowd into afrenzy with their
song about the “sultan of

slapstick.”
“I wrote the rap myself,”
Maron said. “I figured

Bazooka Joe was something

funny that everyone liked.”

Give 61 little and get 61 little with
Clinton '5 National Service Program

By Judith A. Friedl
For The Pitt News

Reaction to President Clinton’s pro-
posed National Service Financial Aid
plan is mixed in various Pitt depart-
ments.~

Some professors and administrators
applauded the president’s intentions
but expressed doubts about how much
good the plan will accomplish.

The National Service Plan asks col-
lege students to work as teachers,
social workers or police for one or two
years in exchange for scholastic finan-
cial aid. The service can be completed
before, during or after attending a two-
or four-year college or a trade school.

Dr. Susan Hansen, director of
Women’s Studies and apolitical sci-
ence professor, liked the plan. She
noted that some other aid programs,
especially those for veterans such as
the GI Bill, benefit more men than
women, simply because there are
more male than female veterans.

“What I especially like about this
program is that it values a range of
activities and will benefit women as
well,” Hansen said. “What I really like

is that teachers and social workers and
even women going into police work
will get some credit for that.”

If Congress passes the program,
1,000 students could get national ser-
vice jobs this summer, with 25,000 stu-
dents joining the plan in fiscal year
1994, which begins Oct. 1, 1995.
Clinton said the plan will include
100,000 students by 1997.

Clinton is asking Congress to fund
the plan at $400 million in 1994, rising
to $3.4 billion in 1997.

Kevin Altomari of the Office of
Admissions and Financial Aid said the
plan is a unique and interesting
approach, but a major difficulty with it
is the limited number of students who
would benefit.

“When you talk about all of the stu-
dents that are involved, in higher edu-
cation in all of its forms, 10(),000 peo-
ple is really not that large a compo-
nent,” Altomari said. “Taking the dol-
lars and putting them towards this pro-
gram at a time when other, more tradi-
tional financial aid programs are at risk
financially — while some may consid-
er that a bold decision, it’s a decision

Hieroglyphics reveal
ancient war ring society

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

After almost a two-year collaborative effort, Pitt anthro-
pology Professor Terence Kaufman has successfully deci-
phered the earliest hieroglyphics in the Meso-American
language.

“I’ve never deciphered anything before,” Kaufman said.

So far, Kaufman, along with colleague John Justeson
from State University of New York, has interpreted 60 to
75 percent of the 1,800-year-old writings found seven
years ago by river workers near Veracruz, Mexico.

The stone monuments consist of 21 columns of pic-
tographs more than 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide.

“Right now there is 150 known signs [on the stonesl,”
he said. “We know the values for 100 of them and are
certain of about 75.”

Kaufman said that the hieroglyphics’ resemblance to
the ancient Mexican language of the Mayans helped him
decipher the writings.

“Although some of the signs look the same, the lan-
guages are quite different,” he said. “It’s more phonetic
than the Mayan text and the narrative is more explicit

In War and filmmaking,
Stone is an award Winner

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Producer, screenwriter and
filmmaker Oliver Stone will
discuss his life’s works and
experiences on Sunday night
at Pitt.

The Oscar winning director
who was a former teacher, sea-
man, soldier and failed novel-
ist before landing in
Hollywood on the strength of
his adapted Midnight Express
film script, will speak in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room.

Stone, best known for his
controversial movies ].F.K.,
Platoon, Born on the Fourth of
July, Wall Street, The Doors
and Scarface, has been
accused by many movie critics
as a radical filmmaker who dis-
torts the truth and facts to

‘ draw attention to his movies.

Harry Kloman, movie critic
for In Pittsburgh and a Pitt
journalism instructor, said

there is no happy median to
reacting to Oliver Stone
movies.

“Either you love them or you
hate them, there usually is no
in between,” he said. “The
biggest problem with his
movies is the emotional assault
the audience feels. The movie
shouts at the audience, there is
no real room to think or
speak.”

Kloman said that Stone’s
success at the box office lies in
the fact that he can make his
audience raise questions about
controversial events in history,
like the assassination of John
F. Kennedy and the Vietnam
War.

“I’d rather see a bad Oliver
Stone movie than a good
Chevy Chase movie because
they make you think,” he said.

Stone, the son of a French
Catholic mother and a Jewish
stockbroker father, was born
in 1946 in New York. He stud-
ied at Trinity School and Yale

first Pitt balked but finally
agreed to investigate after fur-
ther pressure by the lead indus-

serious failures,” history
Professor Janelle Greenberg
said.

The University Senate unani-
mously voted on a resolution
calling for Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor to “take forthright
action to rehabilitate Professor
Needleman’s reputation, as
called for in the university’s own
procedures.”

It also calls for the chancellor
to help Needleman with his loss-

es acquired through legal fees.

This resolution calls upon the
Office of Research Integrity of
the National Institutes of Health
to restore Needleman’s reputa-
tion. It also calls on
Needleman’s accusers, Professor
Sandra Scarr of the University of
Virginia and Professor Clair
Emhart of Case-Westem Reserve
University, to publicly acknowl-
edge that Needleman did not
engage in misconduct.

Incident

Continued from page 1
Brown, Pitt running back
Jermaine Williams and a
former Pitt football player,
Derek Hicks, after a raid of
Brown’s apartment that
turned up approximately
$7,500 in suspected crack
cocaine.

Charges against Brown
and the other player were
later dropped due to a lack
of evidence that they had
been aware of the stash of
crack.

Gilbert, a former All-Big
East defensive end at Pitt,
left the Panthers following
his junior season to make
himself available for the
1992 NFL Draft. The Rams
grabbed Gilbert with the

third pick overall in the
first round, and he went
on to earn All-Rookie hon-
ors.

Terri Simon, manager of
the Original, said she is
very concerned about
declining conditions in
Oakland. Simon, whose
father, owner Sidney
Simon, recently called on
Pitt to increase police pres-
ence on their corner, partly
blames Pitt for last night’s
incident. 4

“Johnny Majors wants
more money for weight
rooms and stuff to make the
football team stronger,”
Terri Simon said. “Why, so
they can hurt some more
policemen?”

Bad Company
So often judgements about people are based
upon the company they keep. A person in ”bad company”
is a bad person. A person keeping ”good company” is a
good person. It's that simple. Do you know that Iesus is
accepted or rejected based more on people's opinions of his
companions or followers, rather than being based on his
own character? It does not matter that Iesus was kind,
loving, just, fair, or honest in his dealings with others.

The Scribes and Pharisees of his day as well
as other ”good" people. rejected him and his messianic
claims because of his associates. Seen in the company of
prostitutes and other sinners, he was summarily rejected.
Today it is no different.

Many students who say they seek the Truth
dismiss Christianity based more on those sinners who
follow Christ than on the basis of the personiof Christ
himself. In other words, they don't go to Church because
of all the hypocrites who do go. It could be that those
people in church know they are sinners and know they
need Christ.

 
  

 
        
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
       
 
     
    
  

It is a fact that many Christians, though they
all follow Jesus, don't necessarily agree with all the
attitudes and actions of their fellow Christians. Christians
are people too. They are each different in personality,
I temperament and behavior. They are not all cast from the
same mold. You may reject Christ because you reject a
certain ”type” of Christian. That's too bad. Jesus Christ,
the most important human being to ever live, has come as
Savior to this world. The honest seeker of Truth must
accept or reject HIM, not those with whom he keeps
company.

There was a prostitute, who met Jesus at a
well. She went back to tell the people of the town. They
listened and went to see him for themselves. How simple.
The ”good news” of Christ came through this sinful
woman. Instead of dismissing her and therefore,
dismissing ]esus,they went out and met Iesus themselves.
Company - good or bad - does not lessen the reality of Jesus
Christ. If he is not God, reject him. If he is God, follow

him.

ing experience, was very
complimentary of the Greeks’
performances. According to
overall Greek Week co-
Chairperson Heather
Nachtmann, the judges’
results were extremely close.

“It is great to see the high
level of talent and dedication
that the competitors put into
this event,” Nachtmann said.

“I’ve been playing guitar
for the past five or six years,”
said Erin Walker, first runner-
up for Greek God. “But lately
I’ve been practicing two,
three hours a day to get
ready.”

Elizabeth Cebak, former
Miss Pennsylvania U.S.A.,
said that she was impressed
with the Greeks’ talent, but

also said that there is another
dimension to the event.

“In college it is important
to build comradery,” Cebak
said. “It is important for indi-
viduals to have the support of
their fraternity or sorority.”

Cinda Hottenstein, of
Kappa Kappa Gamma, won
first runner-up as Greek
Goddess with her sentimental
version of “Friends.”

“We chose Cinda to do this
because we knew she had
the determination, the talent
and the beauty to do this,”
said Christy Masco, her
Kappa Kappa Gamma sister.
“We all love her.”

According to Nachtmann,
the event raised over $3,000
for the Pennsylvania Special
Olympics.

and uses more detail.”

Another way Kaufman
decoded the writings
was by reconstructing it
from descendant lan-
guages which are still
spoken in the area.

“The procedure is to
determine how fre-
quently combinations of
letters occur and match
the signs with prefixes
and suffixes of the writ-
ten language,” Kaufman
said.

The story of the hiero-
glyphics, beginning with
an eclipse of the sun,
traces .a society in war-
fare and the rise of a
warrior king who cap-
tures and decapitates an
enemy. After a bloodlet—
ting ritual, the king and
his people struggle
against another enemy
who throws down its
monuments. The people
discover that the king’s
brother is the enemy,
and stone medallions,
according to Kaufman,
are distributed and
shared by the king.

“It’s a slow process of
checking out the com-
mon signs and plugging
them into all the repeat-
ed cases,” Kaufman
said. “We would form a
hypothesis and try it in
every occurrence of the
sign. If it didn’t work
one time, we would
abandon our hypothesis
and start over.”

In their process,
Kaufman and Justeson
gave annual lectures as
updates “to tell every-
one what we figured
out,” Kaufman said.

Kaufman and Justeson
wrote an article about
their discoveries in the
March 19th issue of
Science magazine. The
two professors will also
be interviewed by The

New Yorle Times and .

Time magazine.

Kaufman plans to
share his discovery with
his students.

What's up, Bill?

Referring to his stance on trade with the European Community,
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs,
called it the “two faces” of Bill Clinton. Championing free trade
one minute and protected markets the next, Brittan’s criticism of
Clinton’s trade policy is anything but off base.

The latest trade debacle over government contracts follows dis-
putes over European steel and agriculture subsidies. Mickey

Kantor, the administration’s trade representative, said that the.

administration would bar European companies from federal con-
tracts unless reciprocal agreement was granted to U.S. utilities
companies in Europe.

The European Community is a complex organization, unlike
any other governmental body today. EC member countries exert
considerably more influence than state governments do in this
country. Clinton’s failure to recognize the complexity of the EC

V will hurt both the European Community and the United States.

As the EC becomes more intertwined, EC member states will
have to forgo some autonomy. Only then will United States access
be increased. In the meantime, if the administration fails to play
its cards right American consumers will be thrown into a quag-
mire of rising prices, and U.S. influence in Europe will become a
thing of the past. Clinton’s muscle ﬂexing will have adverse con-
sequences for both American foreign policy, and business.

Ever since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement,
US. inﬂuence has declined on the European continent.-Now that
Central Europe has found its own identity and the EC has moved
closer toward monetary union, U .S. prodding will be anything but
successful. The EC is no longer subservient to U.S. hegemony.

American businesses abroad could also be hurt. Many American
multinationals operating in Europe are treated as “European com-
panies.” They are given a say over regulation and harmonization
standards — as well as offered contracts to participate in research
and development. If not careful, the Clinton Administration could
end up crushing these companies —-— companies that during times
of recession provided revenue for their native—based parents.

The “two faces” of Bill Clinton, Sir Leon Brittan of the EC called
it. It’s. kind of funny. When translated into “American” it sounds a
whole lot like “Slick Willy.”

Stick toyour guns

In the face of Governor Casey’s coercive techniques, we are
asking that Senator Harris Wofford hold steadfast to his views and
support the bill which will guarantee a woman’s right to an abor-
tion.

Yesterday, Governor Casey told reporters outside the White
House that he hoped Wofford “would not support legislation that
will provide a ‘one-size-fitsvall’ abortion on demand regime for
the entire country.” He stressed the fact that it was he who
appointed Wofford to his Senate seat and that his support is
essential if Wofford hopes to win in November.

Casey’s action, while brilliant political maneuvering, is a sorry
display of what the American political process has become.
Rather than put his own petty self—interests aside and represent
his constituents, Casey has all but extorted a vote from Wofford
— let’s hope he doesn’t give in. .

Wofford has thus far served Pennsylvania well. He has been at
the forefront of both health care reform and _C_linton’s Job Corps
Training Program. Most importantly, though, before elected he
promised to help eliminate government waste in Washington.
Holding true to his word, he pledged to support Clinton’s budget
plan, but not without more spending cuts.

That’s more than enough reason to pledge support for‘ Wofford.

4 Hopefully, Casey will manage to see the light.

gang of youths awarded
points to one another for
forcing sex on girls as
young as 10 years old. Last
week, these six students were

arrested at Lakewood High ’

School in Lakewood, Calif.
The oldest was 18, the other
five were between the ages _of
15 and 17. The students, all
members of the “Spur’s
Posse,” were arrested outside
of their school on assault
charges.

In Monroeville, Pa., this
writer’s hometown, a 17-year-
old Homewood boy was
gunned down outside of
Monroeville Mall by a Garfield
resident. Abdul Thompson,
the victim of this crime, is an
alleged member of the
Homewood “Crips.” His
attacker, a member of the
Garfield “Bloods,” is also 17.
He is still presently at large.
Thompson is now in serious
condition. At the time of the
shooting, Thompson was on a
“supervised outing” under the
Community Intensive
Supervision Program.

Nationally, Bill Clinton and
his administration have shown
interest in making the French
RU-486 abortion pill available
to American women.
According to Roussel-Uclaf,
the pill’s manufacturer, the pill
will be tested on between 10
and 20 thousand American
women within a few months.

These three events may not
seem related, but they are — a
common thread runs through
them all. Gangs, abortion
pills and points for sexually
deviant behavior are all con—
crete evidence of the failure of
Americans to realize the
destructive effects rendered
by a lack of families that are
intact._ ‘

The news from sociologists
is not much more hopeful. In
the April ‘95 issue of The
Atlantic, -Barbara Defoe
Whitehead details the horrible
truth about where America is
heading if its attitude toward

the family continues to be
apathetic and liberal.

In her story “Dan Quayle
Was Right,” Whitehead lets
the facts speak for themselves,
and here they are. Statistics
compiled by the National
Center for Health Statistics
show that in almost all aspects
of life, children whose lives
are complicated by divorce or_
pre-marital birth do worse
than their counterparts who
come from traditional families.
If you are achild in a single
parent household, you are six
times more likely to be poor;
two to three times more likely
to suffer emotional distur-
bance; more likely to use
drugs; drop out of school; and
more likely to be in trouble

with the law or get pregnant
than if you had grown up in
an intact family. '

Even more importantly, chil-
dren who grow up in other-
than-intact families are less
likely to be successful as
adults in work and in love.
“Overall child well-being has
declined, despite a decrease.
in the number of children per
family, an increase in the edu-
cational level of parents and
historically high levels of pub-
lic spending,” writes
Whitehead.

The relationship between
child well—being and the secu-
rity of the family structure
continues to be ignored, and
with a liberal philosophy pre-
vailing among American gov-

’ erning bodies, resolution is

not likely to appear in the
near future. I

Between the liberal views of
Hollywood, where liberation
through divorce continues to
be the status quo, and the
hopelesslyuseless ideas pop-
ping up in the White House
(which would apparently like

to see the RU—486 “easy solu-
tion” pill sold to women as the
ultimate quick fix) little hope

is apparent for the troubled‘

American family. _

Some groups are banding
together to protect the belief
that intact families are the
most viable solution to so
many of the problems facing
this country. The Christian
Coalition, founded by Pat
Robertson, is an 800-chapter
organization that acts locally
to inform people of their goal
nationwide cultural
change. One focus of the
group is an attack on pornog-
raphy. _ »

Federal Bureau of
Investigation statistics show
that 81 percent of serial killers
use pornography, along with
85 percent of rapists. Fifty-
seven ‘percent of rapists admit
imitating po-rnographic scenes
during the commission of
their crimes. The Christian
Coalition, along with sociolo-
gists, espouse the opinionthat
intact family structures are the
most beneficial way to pre-
vent the development of these
occurrences.

The future of America is in
our hands. As we proceed
through college, we learn
many things about the world
around us. Among them is the
fact that we have a responsi-
bility to our neighbors and to
act lunselfishly. While in
school, we must begin to
think about choosing a mate
responsibly, working to keep
our families intact and our
children healthy in mind and
body. If we continue on the
path we chose in the ‘60s
toward the “diversification” of
family structure, sociological
evidence shows that we have
more Crips and Bloods, more
child rapists and less hope to
look forward to.

Just thought I’d let you

I know.

While office polls dominate
the walls with NCAA
Tournament picks, the friend-
lier and more sublime conver-
sations turn toward those who
will snare the Oscars. Like
picking Santa Clara over
Arizona, the Oscars are fear-
less sport. But like March
Madness, it is easy to pick the
top seeds to at least grab
some of the glory.

This year’s lineup is suspi-
ciously intimidating with the
realistic possibility of a sweep
looming. Unlike the surpris-
ing The Silence Of The Lambs
(‘92) brooming, Clint
Eastwood’s Unforgiven is ripe
with the stuff Hollywood laps
at. It’s refreshingly violent,
displays heartwrenching emo-
tions and has just enough big-
name stars to capture the little
gold statue.

Scent of a Woman also has
the guts and gravy to score at
the Oscar feast. Fresh off tak-
ing top billing at The Golden
Globes, Al et al could find
themselves with enough
booty to start another
California gold rush.

This year produced a stun-
ning amount of nominations
for independent films, which
are usually reserved for acco-
lades at film fests and brief
mentions during CNN’s
“Hollywood Minute.” But with
Hozvard’s End and The Crying
Game jostling amongst the
corporate clans, things are up
in the air.»

That notwithstanding, here,

in painful detail, is who we

think will and who we think
should take the cheese at this
year’s gala.

Best Director

Ducats Bet: Martin Brest,



 

/2

Scent ofa Woman, used be a
Hollywood outsider but has
since warmed up to his more
glitzy brethren. Sure, it
doesn’t hurt to have Al Pacino
hanging around the set and a
young buck like Chris
O’Donnell, but no soap,
Marty. Save the cab fare, stay
home Monday.

\X7e’ve got a secret, The
Crying Game will get nothing
and like it. Too much hype,
not enough answers from Neil
Jordan.

Robert Altman’s The Player
was depressingly looked over
for Best Picture and Actor; so
there's little hope that the
Academy will dole out any
props here.

Hozvard’s End has possibil-
ities as it is lofty, majestic and
sports Hannibal Lechter in the
lead. Maybe in a different

year James Ivory would be
passing out the thank—yous,
but not with Clint Eastwood
on the same ticket. Sure,
Clint, we remember Every
Which Way But Loose and it’s
even more painful sequel, but
hey, Oscar’s got a short mem-
ory. Remember Jody Foster in
Frealey Fri day?

We Sez: No doubt The
Player was this year’s best
flick. Robert Altman’s brutal
satire of Hollywood dealings
was tremendous. It was like
Blowout meets Love Story.
Tim Robbins’ debut Bob
Roberts was ignored by the
Academy, but only because
most of the members would
have voted for the fascist
aspiring senator anyway.

Saturday Night, is way out,
even if Billy Crystal is the

host. Fan favorite Jack
Nicholson didn’t look good
enough next to pretty Tom

Gene Hackman garnered best
actor award in 1971 for the
French Connection but hasn’t
been able to escape the shad-
ow of Lex Luther since, thus
the Hack’s role remains
Unforgiven. That leaves the
academy with Al Pacino
(finally a winner at Oscar),
the foul-mouthed pretty boy
with a nice tan from
Glengarry Glen Ross. Al must
have spent too much time
with George Hamilton on the
set of Godfather 3.

We Sez: Lyle Lovett for his

role as the cop in The Player.
Jack Lemmon definitely

deserves props for Glengarry
Glen Ross and Harvey Keitel
in Reservoir Dogs. Either
Pacino or Hackman will do.

between Miranda Richardson,

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, March 25, 1993

Vox gives literary lip service to modern sex

Vox ’ ,
Nicholson Baker
Vintage Contemporaries

Nine-hundred numbers are
everywhere and many
promise intimate phone sex.
They’re in magazines, in per-
sonal columns and on TV.
Any lonely soul with a little
money to spare can now
explore the world of phone
sex from the privacy of his or
her kitchen or bedroom. It’s
safe sex for the ‘90s in the
pulsing wake of the AIDS
virus.

In fact, 900 lines are so
prevalent it makes sense for
someone to sit down and
write a novel about it all. If
this is your thought put your
word processor on hold. With
Vox, Nicholson Baker’s third
experimental novel, the sub-
ject has already been treated.

Vox is a 165-page dialogue

"between Abby and Jim, who

have separately called a ficti-
tious party line called 2VOX
(Vox being a hip plural for
voices), and have found each
other interesting enough to
have themselves removed to
a telephonic “back room,”
where they can arouse each
other free from interruption.
What follows are a series of
erotic discourses between the
two which smack of lengthy
“l’enthouse Forum” letters.

Sound boring? Not so.

These little stories are much
more than, “The summer I
was 16 I cut this one lady’s
lawn and she was divorced
and  etc.” Abby fantasizes in
showers about bawdy house
painters who use her for a
human easel. Jim fantasizes
about driving around the
neighborhood with a female
orgasm tracking device; one,
that is, which actually works.
Baker’s penchant is for the
acute description of the little
things which comprise our
world: ‘cable TV reception,
sexy mail order catalogues,
long fadeouts on rock songs
and, of course, 900 lines.
Baker is also a master of rec-
ognizing the erotic through
all the senses. Abby’s and
Jim’s fantasies are original,
particular, intelligent, some-
times ridiculous and often
very funny: a further discus-
sion of them would only spoil
the fun.

So is Vox simply two char-
acters taking turns getting
each other off, THE END, or
is there something literary
and artistic going on? The
answer is both. No doubt,
Abby’s and Jim’s verbal fan-
tasies have the intention of
arousal culminating in orgasm
(which does define Vox as
pornographic), but Baker is
able to sneak a number of lit-
erary elements into the narra-
tive. Metafiction abounds in

the way Abby and Jim go
about constructing their fan-
tasies. Baker also does a
bang-up job of representing
the nature of human dia-
logue; consisting in, as Abby
and Jim become more famil-
iar, decreased nervousness,
inside jokes, a few well-
directed tangents and a dis-
course which takes on a life
of its own.

As should be expected in
good fiction, the reader is
presented with two fictional
lives which affect one anoth-
er. Abby is a modern woman
—— professional, confident
and attractively domineering
—— who has resorted to using
this phone service asa result
of a broken heart, perhaps
seeing it as a safety device.
She is well—spoken and a
touch more conservative than
Jim, a professional man with
time and money at hand, who
enjoys tapping into the
orgasms of strangers.
Throughout the narrative
Abby refines Jim into a more
caring, Verbal lover, pointing
out to him some things
women find attractive, like
strong hands, of which he
was previously unaware. Jim,
in turn, coaxes Abby a little
more out of her shell and, at
the end, with their mutual
agreement to meet in person,
seems to be the perfect
replacement for her vague

lost love.

Vox may leave a reader flat
at first because Baker doesn’t
provide much information
about Abby’s and Jim’s per-
sonal lives, and so they don’t
come across as sympathetic
characters. But to find disap-
pointment with the novel
because of this aspect is to
misunderstand the intentions.
Baker’s 900 line is concerned
with “fantastic” sexual fulfill-
ment, which pulls away from
the personal. And that’s the

only reason Abby and Jim.

meet. To have the two spout

off about personal matters:

would have been anti—ethical
and dry. ZVOX is for fantasy,
not reality. Along the way,
Jim explains why he prefers
the perverse, as does Abby,
and the explanations make
sense. When Abby and Jim do
meet in person, they will have
a mental as well as physical
understanding of what their
sexual needs are. Love can
come later. And behind it all
is Nicholson Baker, nodding
in approval.

Vox is a timely, unique

'novel and an entertainment.

its subject matter is danger-
ous and its presentation is
modernly stylistic. And as
Charles Bukowski writes, “To
do a dangerous thing with
style is what I call Art.”

Velocity Girl
C opacetic
Sub Pop

The lovable pop quintet
Velocity Girl, taking its name
from an old Primal Scream
song, are leading a new front
of music in Washington, D.C.
The group’s latest effort,
Copacetic, released by their
label SubPop, is the band’s
first full-length effort. The
band’s previous label,
Slumberland, handled the
band’s earlier singles, which
were put on the Velocity Girl,
self-titled EP compilation,
released on Slumberland last
summer.

The band’s first public
musical recognition was on
SpinArt’s CD One Last Kiss,
with “My Forgotten Favorite”
and Slumberland’s Fortune
Cookie Surprise with “Tales

of a Brave Aphrodite,”
appearing on Beat
Happening cover/tribute
compilation.

The band’s current five-
member lineup with Archie
(bass and guitar); Berny (bass
and guitar); Jim (drums);
Kelly (guitar); and Sarah
(vocals) finds Sarah replacing
the original vocalist Bridget,
whose commitment to her
original band, Unrest, left
the band voiceless. But
Sarah arrived in time for the
band to get inked to the
mighty Indie label Sub Pop,
and Velocity Girl is making
waves on the love-rock
scene.

“A Chang” is a burst of loud
feedback, and a infested tune
with melodic vocals iced on
it. Sarah’s vocals is like 21
vision of the Virgin Mary dur-
ing the Blizzard of ‘93. Her
training in operatic style
singing, which is unlike the
Cocteau Twin’s Elizabeth
Frazier’s high-pitched moan-
ing, is audibly breathtaking.

“Audrey’s Eye” is love-pop
brilliance. A bundle of jan-
gles with catchy lyrics. It’s

Love Field that no one ever saw. Emma
Thompson gets nothing for Howard’s End,
which ends up on the wrong side of the stick

McDonnell plays a role that the academy has
awarded in the past, that of a woman confined
to a wheelchair who must get on with her life
in John Sayles’ exhaustive but exquisite
Passion Fish. But, Susan Sarandon gets the
weepy nod here with the tai1or—made mother

We Sez: Of the nominees we’re rootin’ for
the French dame. Jessica Lange was sensuous
in Night And The City, but that’s pushing it.
Eliminate the category this year.

Filme de Mieux

Ducats Bet: The movies up for Best
Picture represent an interesting mix of com-
mercial successes and modest producers.
They include huge studio projects and
independent releases. They feature
Hollywood royalty and upstart newcomers.
Most notably, though, they all sound like
potential porn flicks: some hard-core, some
Candida Femme.

A Few Good Men will not win despite the
Academy’s unconscionable habit of award-
ing Tom Cruise movies. Hozvard’s End has
been forgotten about, so count it out.

Another big loser this year will be The
Crying Game, but with Boy George singing
the title track, it deserves to be dumped.
Scent ofa Woman won the Golden Globes
and tradition tells that it will get the Oscar.
But not this year, as Unforgiven will take
the top honor. Crack a beer, Mayor
Eastwood.

We Sez: We’ve got two words: The
Player. And maybe Laa’_)»bugs, it’s a comedy
with balls and kick starring Rodney D. as a
girls soccer coach. Really, though, Reservoir
Dogs is what film is all about. Props to Gas,
Food. Lodging and Indie cinema! Bob
Roberts is also good to go as is the redemp-
tive Bad Lieutenant. Of the flicks nominat-
ed, Unforgiven is the best.

essence of Velocity Girl’s
karma, a great tune and wor-
thy of buying the album.
Archie, the “boy voice” of the
band, takes the lead vocals
on “Lisa.” His voice isn’t as
powerful as Sarah’s, but it
does well with the song, the
hard guitar’s subtle noise
drowns out most of his
vocals.

“57 Waltz” begins with a
slow rhythm but expresses
the heavier side of Velocity
Girl’s sound. “Candy. Apples”
begins with a conversation of
the members of Velocity Girl,
although the conversation
can’t be really interpreted,
there’s always someone
laughing. “Candy Apples” is a
sleepy instrumental, with a
wind chime blowing in
the background. And I
wasn’t laughing when I heard
this. .

The band follows it up with
an angst-filled tune,
“Catching Squirrel.” Velocity
Girl creates another soaking,
distorted guitar song with
dreamy vocals. “Pretty Sister”
is so damn mellow and with
her vocals style, you might
start to daydream for awhile.
But that illusion will soon
disappear when the blur of
distorted guitars crashes into
the song.

nitely another top tune.
While the band effortlessly
plays, Sarah’s pretty vocals
rainbow on the song again.
The next song, “Copacetic,”
reflects most of “Crazy
Town’s” personality. “Pop
Loser” is a Smiths-like tune,
jangle with heavy amounts of
misery. It’s a biography of a
failed pop writer. “Living
Well” resurrects early
Velocity Girl style, a heavy
distorted guitar done with
happy pop. The song is final-
ized with enough feedback to
fill any Nirvana album.

Velocity Girl is America’s
answer to My Bloody
Valentine, Ride and all the
other English bands that fon-
dle the scene that gaze at
their shoes. The group’s sim-
ple sounds, many may put
them off, but they show the
group’s brilliance and inno-
cence. All of the band’s, earli-
er songs are also worth track-

OK, so we didnt all go 16 for 16 in ourpools for
the first tuo rounais, and we may have lea’ a few of
you astray last Yhursday. But some of us are still
feeling like basketball authorities, genuine hoop
gurus, as it were. Therefore, we’re back with anoth-
erset of fearless forecastsfree betting advice to all of
you who haLen’t seen George Washington play in
person or still think Louisville has Penis Ellison and
Billy Yhompson in its starting ﬁie.

Pugs’ Picks — (Thus far, 11 of my original .416
remain, including three of Final Four. Duke was the
victim.)

East Regional: The Meadowlands, normally the
March home of Duke, will instead host North
Carolina this time around. The Tar Heels are rolling
through the anorexic Eastern bracket and appear
Bayou bound. The only thing that stands in its way
is a pair of trapping clubs that play at breakneck
speed.

Arkansas has lots of athletes and defensive stop-
pers at key positions, but Eric Montross shall have
his way inside. George Lynch still does not get
enough respect. (Yes, he is NBA material.) The
Razorbacks will keep this one interesting with
Darrell Hawkins and Corey Beck frustrating the Tar
Heel perimeter game, but too much Tar Heel poise
and discipline wins it.

Cincinnati should have enough to outlast a hot
Virginia club, which, admittedly, I did not feel was
legitimate as of a week ago. Center Ted Jeﬂiies has
played very big for the Cavs and needs to continue
here against Corie Blount. The Bearcats cannot play
any better than they did against New Mexico State,
but Nick Van Exel needs to step up.

As dangerous as Cincy is, there’s no picking
against UNC.

Pugs says: It Won’t be easy, but Dean and
the Heels go backto the Supendome.

Southeast: Everybody that picked Seton Hall to
reach New Orleans had blinders on. Kentucky was
the best team in America entering this tournament
and has solidiﬁed that status, ruthlessly crushing its
opposition. Granted Rider and Utah are mud, but
the ‘Cats have shown no weakness.

And Florida State — awesome to this point. The
much—anticipated FSU—Hall confrontation did not
materialize, fortunately for P.].’s Pirates. The
Seminoles are nearly unbeatable when on their
game, and Charlie Ward (who will be the 1995
Heisman Trophy winner) has been dazzling.

. The ‘Noles meet a tremendous stable of athletes
in Western Kentucky. Darnell Mee is no joke, but
he can’t possibly check the entire FSU perimeter
game. Kentucky has too much for Rodney Rogers
and Co., but this game will be much closer than
many think thanks to Randolph Childress.

things to say. But one thing they’re dead right on
is the importance of styles and matchups. Styles
of play go a long way in deciding these games.
Just ask Seton Hall. _

And as much as every coach and player will
tell you it’s the teams that decide the games, not
individual players, don’t believe for a second that
marquee matchups won’t alter the outcomes.

That was obvious Sunday when, for a number
of reasons, Iowa’s Acie Earl disappeared down
the stretch while Wake Forest’s Rodney Rogers
ﬂat out took over in the Demon Deacons’ narrow
victory over the Hawkeyes.

So when action kicks into high gear tonight
and tomorrow, do not lose sight of the keys:
styles and some stellar individual matchups. Try

Fitt baseball rampages through 12-1 Flrida trip

"By Jason Brame

and Tom Schneider
The Pitt News

The Pitt baseball team kicked
off its 1993 season with a
resounding 12-1 spring record
during its annual Florida trip.

Playing such teams as the
Philadelphia College of Textile
and Science, Eastern Mennonite
University and John Carroll, the
Panthers compiled a team .350
batting average and a compos-
ite 3.21 ERA while touching up
their opponents for nearly 8.5
runs per game.

During a March 11 triplehead-
er, the Ospreys of North Florida
handed the Panthers their only
loss, a 10-6 decision, but Coach
Mark Jackson’s Panthers
rebounded to bury EMU 20-4
and squeaked by Wagner 4-3 in
the nightcap.

“I’m real happy with the
team’s performance,”- outfielder
Kurt Allen said. “It just wasn’t
one guy who carried the team
— it was a team effort.”

“We’ve never had so much
excitement coming off a spring
trip,” pitcher Ron Hanawalt
said. “This is the best record

we’ve ever had for the spring.”

Among those who helped
send teams like Northern
Kentucky and Anderson back
home with losses were former
Big East pitcher of the week Bill
Junker, who compiled a 1-0
record and an impressive 0.00
ERA in seven innings and Gregg
Mrochko who compiled a
record of 2-0 with seven strike-
outs in 13 innings.

Among one of the biggest
surprises of the trip was the
play of first—year player Matt
Skokowski, who registered two
saves "in his first two appear-
ances with the teams.

“He was the biggest surprise,”
Allen said. “He doesn’t say all
that much, but he lets his
actions speak for him on the
mound. When we needed
someone to shut a team down,
he’s the guy we turned to.”

The Panthers began the sea-
son with a doubleheader sweep
against the Philadelphia Textile
Rams, 9-5 and 10-5. Pitchers
Jason Rakers and Brian Shaffer
picked up the wins.

Pitt then faced Anderson
University, sending the Ravens
to a 8-7 and 8-3 defeats. Robert

Richardson and Mrochko gar-
nered the‘ victories for the
Panthers.

Ohio Wesleyan provided very
little competition for Pitt as the
Battling Bishops could manage
only two hits and one run off of
pitcher David Kelley, while the
Panthers rolled to a 5-1 victory.

Following the North Florida
loss in the March 11 triplehead-
er, the frustrated Panthers
opened up batting practice
against the Royals of Eastern
Mennonite. Pitt’s offensive
machine was in high gear for
the entire contest, as the
Panthers racked up 20 runs on
15 hits in the 20-4 Victory.,
Senior pitcher Ed Curtis was
awarded the win.

The final game of the triple-
header was the first of two
games against the Seahawks of
Wagner College. The 4-3 Pitt
win provided Rakers with his
second win of the young sea-
son.

Game two of the twin—bill
against the Seahawks was
Junker’s first start of the season ,
and turned out to be his first
win. He was stunning, pitching

New coach gives Pitt a
Major (s) recruiting edge

On the surface, nothing
seemed all that different last
Monday at the press room of
Pitt Stadium ——- the site of
Pitt’s annual spring football
media luncheon.

The table and podium set-
up was about the same (save
two round tables on the left
side of the rectangular ban-
quet room). The lunch offer-
ing was again top shelf (riga-
toni, chicken and salad). And
the same familiar herd of
media and PR people were
gorging themselves with said
spread of much heaven.

_But something was amiss
-— or rather, rarely seen in
recent years — once the mas-
ter of pigskins, head

but also Pitt’s recent failures.

Whatever the case (and
with his personal style and
on-field substance, there are
plenty of both to choose
from), there was a sense of
respect, a vibe of power
emitting from the 57-year-old
Tennessee native.

It was a captivating power
that sounded loudly and
proudly, “Listen to me!” After
introducing each Pitt player
—— each of whom stood up
immediately after being
called —— he directed, “Thank
you, men,” and the players
sat. After calling on each new
Pitt coach —— who all stood in
the same disciplined manner
— he stated, “Thank you,

The Pitt women’s track team makes the transition
from indoor to outdoor competition this weekend,-
and head coach Steve Lewis said he expects to build
on the unexpected success of this winter.

“We did very well considering the injuries that set
us back during the indoor season,” Lewis said.
“Several athletes stepped up and made great contri-
butions.”

Allison Williams and Najuma Fletcher played
major roles in picking up the team after two of Pitt’s
top mnners, Ronise Crumpler and Carmela Manani,
went down with injuries.

Williams, a senior, ran the fastest 55-meter hurdle
time in the United States at the Big East
Championships and was recently named All-
American at the National Championships in
Indianapolis. She placed sixth in the country in the
55-meter hurdles.

“Allison ran outstanding in the Hoosierdome,”
Lewis said. “Hopefully she can continue that kind of

Williams makes All-American in track

success.”

Fletcher, a frrst—year student, set three Pitt records
this year and is a member of the worid record-hold-
ing shuttle hurdle relay team. She finished third in
the triple jump, long jump and high jump at F.CACs.

“Najuma is very talented, and we look to her to do
good things for us in the future,” Lewis said.

Lewis says Pitt can only improve this weekend
when Williams and Fletcher will be joined by
Crumpler and Mariani at the Alabama Relays for the
opener of the outdoor season.

According to Lewis, Crumpler is Pitt’s leading
sprinter and will compete in the 400-meter, 100-
meter hurdles and several relays.

“I’m satisﬁed with her progress,” Lewis said. “I’d

say she’s back to 80 percent of her full potential.”

Mariani, who has been nagged by a leg injury, will
compete in the 10,000-meter run.

Fletcher is set to run hurdle-and relay events,
while Williams will run sprint events in addition to
hurdles and relays. ,

head coaches Paul Hackett,
Foge Fazio and Mike
Gottfried talked so to be

wanted to hear what he

primp and pose — with
that season-long vacation
his only obligation.

Oh yeah. He’s already the
poster child for the Ted
Simmons School of Bigtime
Boners. ~ I

Maybe Mike LaValliare?
He’s cute, snuggly and
frumpy —— like the Snuggle
bear.

No. Can’t work. It’s a ver-
tical growth chart. And
besides, Spanky may be a
Yankee before the film gets
developed.

How about Jim “Marlboro
Man” Leyland? He’s the
best manager in baseball
and everyone feels real
sorry for him — minus
Barry and all.

Naaah. It wouldn’t be the
best message to send out.
just think ofjimmy
Chainsmoke sucking on a
cancer stick, standing next
to the ol’ black—line mea-
suring stick. Ugly stuff.

I guess the most logical
choice for poster child
would be Vince Lascheid,
the organist at Three Rivers

entertaining and he’ll be
around allyear long. He

might be playing “Taps” all

McCullough — especially
with Antigua needed to

McCullough carried the
team to the 13-2 start, but he
is too erratic as a shooter to
do it consistently. One of the
reasons his play suffered in
the second half of the Season
was that he forced things as
teammates could not pick up
the slack. McCullough is an
outstanding player who will
get better, but he needs
help.

°Then there is the most
crucial task Evans is facing,
finding a new “fat lady sings”
man on his bench.

This is the player that,
when he enters the game,
you know it is over. Brush
was once such a player, but
he developed into a solid
contributor in his senior sea-
son.

Brock Generalovich was
one until Evans decided to
try to utilize his shooting
skills late in the season.
Travis Ziegler took over
then, but he is graduating
along with Brush and

way with him. Dare is legit.

But the Wolverines’ duo will
use its quickness and experi-
ence to frustrate him and could
put him on the bench in early
foul trouble. Webber has as
much heart as anybody in the
game (see Last Sunday’s UCLA
thriller) and is almost to the
point where he's capable of
willing his team to victory.
Howard is the steady and silent
cog, always there to bail out the
Big Blue when times get tough.

much left to be said.

Rogers, 6’7” and 235 pounds,
has the body of a mythological
Greek god, sculpted out of gran-
ite and steel and ready to chal-
lenge Karl Malone for the NBA’s
best body next season. He’s
quick and powerful with an
explosive baseline step. He also
steps out to drill the three as
does Mashbum.

The Monster Mash should be
the top pick in the upcoming
NBA draft with no weaknesses
in his game. He uses every bit of
his 6’8” and 230 pound inside
and out and handles unbeliev-
ably.

Most of all, Mash is a winner.

which leads to my All-American
selections. While some choose
the five best players regardless
of position, the structure of this
team is three frontcourt players
and a backcouit tandem.

First Team: F Glenn
Robinson, sophomore, Purdue;
F Jamal Mashbum, junior,
Kentucky; F Calbeit Cheaney,
senior, Indiana; G Bobby
Hurley, senior, Duke (my Player
of the Year); and G Anfernee

Hardaway, junior, Memphis
State.

Second Team: F Chris
Webber, Soph., Michigan; F
Rodney Rogers, ]r., Wake
Forest; C Acie Earl, Sr., Iowa; G
Sam Crawford, Sr., New Mexico
State; and G J.R. Rider, Jr.,
UNLV.

Third Team: C Eric Montross,
Sr., North Carolina; F Chris Mills,
Sr., Arizona; F Grant Hill, Jr,
Duke; G Nick Van Exel, Sr.,
Cincinnati; and G Terry Dehere,
Sr., Seton Hall.

Not to be outdone, our show-
case editor/ prominent hoop
prognosticator, Brian Berger,
has awakened with his All-
American squad.

First Team: Player of the
Year: Glenn Robinson,
Mashbum, Cheaney, Hurley and
Hardaway.

Second Team: Rogers,
Montross, Webber, Rider and
Dehere.

Third Team: Mills, Earl,
Florida State senior Doug

Kentucky meets Florida State in
the most exciting game of the tour-
ney.

Pugs says: The ‘Cats “mash”
FSU, and it’s Lethal Weapon 3 in
OT.
Midwest: Duke is out, but that
won’t help Indiana. Louisville will
get its ninning game ﬂowing and
that spells a big red exit for the
Hoosiers.

Jason Kidd leads Cal against a
rejuvenated Kansas squad, and the
Bears’ unlikely trek ends. Iamond
Murray will light it up again, but the
Jayhawks will win going away with
Darrin Hancock throwing down
nasty jams at garbage time.

The-Runnin’ Cards meet the
Jayhawk precision attack in the
toughest selection of the weekend.

Pugs says: Roy Williams is
back to meet his mentor Dean
again as KU survives a War.

West: The Wolverines are
primed. Chris Webber is screaming
and scowling. Jalen Rose is smiling.
And Juwan Howard is doing just
what it takes to win championships.
George Washington is a great story,
and Yinka Dare will make it at least
this far again, but this is it for now.
Colonial guards Dirk Surles and
Alvin Pieisall could keep them in it
for a half, but Michigan is much too
much.

As for T emple—Vandy, strap it up
for this one. The Commodores’
perimeter attack will be severely

tested by an active matchup zone.
Vanderbilt looks stronger than I
anticipated, and fate has served
them well, drawing another
perimeter club. But John Chaney is
one of the truly elite coaches in
March and is riding the wave of a
blazing trio in juniors Aaron McKie
and Eddie Jones and sophomore
point man Rick Brunson. Temple
survives.

The Fab Five meets its worst
nightmare, a slowdown game
against a crafty zone.

Pugs says: It doesn’t matter,
Hail Hail to Michigan for two
straight Final Fours.

Gallagher’s Outlook — (Pre-
outlook note: all four of BG’s ﬁnal
four selections are alive and kicking
in the 1993 Dance for Number One:
Kentucky, Michigan, Cincinnati and
Indiana). ’

Southeast: UK all the way —
almost.

After plowing through n'nky—dink
Rider and Pitt-pounders Utah, the
Wildcats are primedgfor some
decent competition. The Forest will
supply that — for about 14 minutes
—— before falling to Mr. Mashburn
and company.

Florida State should bounce
Western Kentucky — setting up a
high—ﬂying UK—FSU showdown.
Take Pitino over Kennedy in a
semi—walk. Kentucky is just too
much.

BG’s pick: KENTUCKY

West: Meeechigan all over again.

Despite a mucho-scare from usu-
al1y—ultra slacking UCLA, the
Wolverines don’t figure to break
much of a sweat versus gamey
George Washington and the win-
ner of Vandy—Temple.

GW has super phenom Yinka
Dare, but the Wolves have five
super sophs named Webber, King,
Howard, Rose and Jackson. Nice
run, GW. See ya next year.

As for Temple-Vanderbilt, ﬂip a
coin. I’ll stick with my pretourna-
ment pick in Vanderbilt. But it
won’t matter. Michigan is headed
for New Orleans. Period.

BG’s pick: MICHIGAN

East: He1ter—ske1ter hits the
Queen City.

The matchup of the brackets two
hottest teams — UNC and Cincy —
won’t materialize. Why? Arkansas.

After the their comeback win
over the Johnnies, the Razorbacks
will harass the Tarheels, sending
Dean Smith back to his dome with
yet ‘another “Sweet Sixteen” banner
and a state full of broken hearts.

Cincy will see the re-emergence
of Nick “I got a bagful of tricks” Van
Exel and sprint past both Virginia
and emotion—drenched Arkansas
for a second straight ﬁnal four bid.

BG’s pick: CINCINNATI

Midwest: Calbert and the
Hoosierites.

Indy is the question mark of the
foursome — almost falling to
Letterman-wannabe Pete Gillen
and Xavier. Sure, they’re without
Alan Henderson. Sure, they have a
lunatic as head coach. But they

have the college player of the year
in Calbert Cheaney and they deﬁ-
nitely will not face Duke in the near
future.
Translation: Indy to Louisiana.
Kansas will burst Cal’s upset bub-
ble but won’t match up with the
system—savvy machine known as
Hoosier basketball. Take BK and
boys.
BG’s pick: INDIANA
' —Brian Gauagber

Southeast: Kentucky beats
Wake 82-71 as Mash and Travis
Ford go crazy against the Deacs.
Randolph Childress is gonna bomb,
but ‘Cats’ first—year guard Tony Delk
from Brownsville, Tenn., Haywood
High, will use this as his coming out
P31TY- A

Pitino’s crew then beats Florida
St. in the “Elite Eight” as Charlie
Ward notches 15 points, dishes
nine assists and records seven
steals. He then reports to the weight
room next week to get ready for
football season, WHEN BOBBY
BOWDEN BEATS MIAMI 27-24.

Southeast Pick: Kentucky

West: Michigan, Michigan,
Michigan. The UCLA scare will
vault this team into the Finals, let
alone the Final Four. Vandy had a
great run and a great season but
Michigan is just too damn much,
even if Billy McCalfrey sports the
Gallagher—esque hair.

I’m not forgetting Yinka Dare out
there in Colonial—land. He was the
surprise of the season, but he won’t
be able to handle the boys down
low from Ann Arbor. BTW, you

think that Omo Moses is thankful
that he got the hell out of Dodge?
Where are the Panthers now that
GW is in the ole Sweet 16?

West Pick: Michigan

Midwest: If the sight of Alan
Henderson playing against Xavier
wasn’t an irispiiational sight, then
you need to watch Hoosiers again.
The ﬂat—top wearin’ workhorse will
not see the big—time PT against
Louisville, which is too bad .

In the upset of the tourney (for-
get Santa Clara, I listened to Jim
Rome and picked against the ‘Cats),
Denny Crum’s crew runs the
Hoosiers out of the building (and I
don’t mean blowout, I mean up-
tempo offense) as Dwayne Morton
scores 22 and the Cardinals win 88-
85. Don’t tell the people down in
Memphis that Louisville is in the
“Elite Eight” — they’re still reeling
after the job Darnell Mee did on
them in the first round. (P.S. Penny,
stay one more year, I haven’t gotten
a chance to see you play in person
yet.)

Look, I don’t care how much .

attention Jason Kidd is getting right
now, Pugs, he is the first-year player
of the year. I don’t want to hear
Othella (Harrington), I don’t want
to hear Yinka. Kidd is the man.

Unfortunately Cal won’t beat
Kansas. The Adonis Jordan/ Rex
Walter backcourt is very, very
tough. (Even though I keep seeing
the same highlight of Walters — he
gets the ball at halfcourt and cuts to
the hoop while drawing the foul
over and over and over and over.)
Kansas will squeak by by two, 74-
72, but Lamond Munay will have a
monster night, scoring 25 and snag-
ging 12 boards.

Oh yeah, Kansas beats Louisville

in the “Elite Eight” to obliterate my

Final Four pid<. (I chose Duke.)

Midwest Pick: Kansas

East: Eric Montross gets a profile
in SI and now we’re supposed to
revel in this guys splendor? Yup.
Heisaman-childinthepaintandis
throwing around his body with
reckless abandon.

Look, Nolan Richardson and his
40 minutes of hell are great, but this
kind of sound, disciplined, mental-
ly tough team will not crack against
the Hogs. I

Cinci beats Virginia. (Hey, I never
said I’ll take Manhattan College, I
was talking Kansas St., OK?) But
Bobby Huggins falls one step short
of returning to the Final Four. UNC
is and will be crowned the best in
this region. Sony, Pugs.

East Pick: North Carolina

—_]ason Brame

Well, the Sweet 16 is upon us
again. Predictions will ﬂy and some
will be shot down. So I’ll throw up
some of my own clay birds and see
if any of them break.

Southeast: My prediction of
Seton Hall winning the national
championship was a “dead duck.”
With the Pirates out, the region
belongs to Kentucky. Rick Pitino
will guide the Wildcats past a solid
Wake Forest team and hope for the
best against Florida State.

The Seminoles will meet
Kentucky after they dispatch an
over—achieving Western Kentucky
squad that will still be celebrating its
win over Seton Hall. But Florida
State will have no luck against the

“other” Kentucky and will bow out
gracefully.

Southeast Pick: Kentucky

West: Again my pick — Arizona
—— is out early. With these ‘Cats
gone, the Wolverines will take their
place. After one heck of a scare
against UCLA, Michigan will dis-
patch George Washington, the
Atlantic 10 Cinderella story.

In the other bracket look for
Vanderbilt to be a little too much
for Temple’s zone. Vandy will
shoot from outside and the Owls
will only be able to stand there and
watch. Michigan, however, is the
best of this West

West Pick: Michigan

East: look for Dean Smith’s crew
to keep on rolling, the only Final
Four pick of mine still in the tour-
ney. North Carolina will beat an
Arkansas team that should have
been out of the tournament last
week against St. John’s.

Look for Virginia and Cincinnati
to scrap‘ at each other for 40 min-
utes in the other East semi-final.
The Cavaliers will wave their ﬂashy
swords and cut down the Bearcats
in the end. But no matter how
excited Virginia may be after
Cincinnati, they will go no further.
The Heels romp and rule this East

East Pick: North Carolina

Midwest: It’s nothing new that
my original Midwest pick, Duke, is
out of the tournament. (Shhhl Don’t

tell anybody of my one—for—four-

debacle.) So it looks like Indiana
will be the team to stop. Calbert
Cheaney will turn up his game and
beat Louisville in a close one.

In the other bracket, look for

‘ California to be mentally drained
' after its upset of Duke. With no

brain and just a Kidd (Jason that is),
Kansas will coast. But the team’s
ride will be cut short by Bobby
Knights men in the red and white.
Midwest Pick: Indiana
1 know all these picks are the
number one seeds of their regions,

weekend.

“We have several solid young
runners,” Lewis said. “Sophomore

Lewis said Miles will be another
important contributor to Pitt in the
heptathlon this weekend, but
stressed that the key to Pitt’s success
is balance.

Pitt will face teams from the SEC,
ACC and Big 10 this Friday at the
Alabama competition, a non—scor-

My picks for the Sweet 16 con-
tains only one guarantee: Pitt is not
going to the Final Four. If this is
news to you, you really ought to
pick up a copy of The Pitt News
more often. Perspective "Editor Brett
Gilman has not accepted the fact
that Pitt has lost, and he will still
accept bets that the Panthers will be
in New Orleans. Well here goes
nothing;

-IntheEastIseeCa_rolina rolling
all the way to New Orleans. Dean
Smith has been a lock in getting to
the Sweet 16, but this year he’s
going to be dancing in the streets of
East Rutherford as his team
advances to the Final Four.

Cincinnati will be the only possi-
ble test for the Tar Heels, but after a

tough win against Virginia, Carolina
will simply out last them. Virginia
killed me just being in the Sweet 16,
so I have to cheer against them.

-In the Midwest things get a little
tougher. Indiana got a tough game
out of Xavier in the last round, so
this team seems vulnerable. The
key to an Indiana win over‘
Louisville is if it can control the
glass. If the Hoosiers can outre-
bound the Cardinals, the game
belongs to them.

I hope Indiana loses (being from
Syracuse I still wake up in the mid-
dle of the night with images of
Keith Smart nailing a jumper over
Howard Trich to win the champi-
onship in 1987), but Bobby Knight
is gonna fire up the troops to get
the W. Indiana will face Kansas in
the regional final.

Jason Kidd is a great player, but I
don’t think he can handle the
amount of, pressure that is going to
be put on him by the Kansas back-

court. Then it’s going to be Indiana
advancing to the Final Four. I
would rather not think about the
last time I saw Indiana in New
Orleans, but at least the Hoosiers
won’t be able to beat Syracuse
there again.

-Now we move to the Southeast.
Nashville was a fun time, but I
would have loved a trip to
Charlotte. Kentucky has to many
weapons for Wake Forest Rodney
Rogers is a great player, but Jamal
Mashbum is even better. The out-
side game of the Wildcats will be
the difference in this game.

Rick Pitino and company will be
playing Florida State in the regional
ﬁnal. I have to go with FSU for two
reasons: Pugs loves the Seminoles,
and they knocked JB’s boys out of
the first round. I like the combina-
tion of Sura and Ward, but there is

no way they can stop Kentucky .

from going to the Final Four. The
Wildcats will be on their way the

New Orleans alter they blow out
the Seminoles. Yes, I said blow out.

°Out there in the West it’s got to
be Michigan over George
Washington. Yinka Dare is one of
the b<5t up and coming big men in
the country, but he is no matdi for
Michigan.

Chris Webber is ptunpcd up, and
when he’s pumped up you can
simply hand Michigan the victory.

Vandy is going to have a bit more
trouble than Michigan, but they too
will advance to the regional ﬁnals.
Temple’s great defense could give
Billy McCaffrey trouble, but the
Commodores will prevail in a tight
game.

Michigan is a great team, but it is
going to be stopped in its tracks by
Vandy. Just being in Nashville is
enough to get caught up in
Commodore fever.

My Final Four: Kentucky,
Carolina, Indiana and Vandy.
