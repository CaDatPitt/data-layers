Dr. Samuel Callen addressed the

Callen also addressed the students one
year ago last Wednesday, this fact

coincident. He said in part:

“A-certain man has said in speaking
of higher education that its inﬂuence
is degenerating. This is notquite so
but we can admit that we are sur-
rounded by many inﬂuences that‘ are
not the best, and we are compelled to
ﬁght against these things.

“Every man is religious more or
less. We s-ometimes hear people say
that there is no such thing as religion
but there comes a time in every per-
son’s life when they cannot deny the

' fact that there is religion and that this

religion is one of the most important
factors in a person’s life.

Many people are very anxious to

change their mode of living and to

Fresh Havegiiilsictures Taken a la F

FRESH POSE  

FOR PICTURE

 

.1904 Men Pour Flour on Freshman

When Under Classmen Pose for
Owl Picture.

 

On Friday morning on the steps of
State Hall, when the Freshmen were
lined up to have their class picture
taken for the Owl, the Sophomores
pulled off a stunt that made the
Freshies anxious for their Sophomore
year to come and the Sophs glad that
theirs was at hand.

It happens just once a year and the
Freshmen should have expected‘ it, but
they didn't. The w/ily Sophs beat them
to it this time. The Sophs were irv
the Biology laboratory, each one of
them supplied with a sack of “Pills—
bury’s Best.” The critical moment had
arrived. There were the unsuspecting
ever trusting Freshmen below, the
co—eds wore their prettiest smile, and
just as the photographer said “hats
-off,” the crash came. So-me of the
fair co-eds made perfectly charming
blonds, and powder was very becom-
ing to the fellows.

‘ Of course the Freshmen wanted tr-
retaliate immediately but the Sophs
had apprehended this move and all
entrances to State Hall were cut off
One very bold Sophomore, who felt
thatlthe burden of his class rested on
his shoulders‘, tried to brave the
crowd and but for the timely inter-
vention of the Chancellor our dear
Sophomore would be no more. "It
was a greatlark and enjoyed by botl"
classes. lt is one of those things that
make University life worth while.

Had any members of the cast of
living class been present they would
have reported at their next meeting
that ﬂour was going down. There
hasn’t been such a drop on the market
for years. But

“Cheer up, little Freshmen!
Don’t you cry; ,

You’ll be Sophomores
Bye and bye.”

Small Growers Can Utilize All of Crop

Through Discovery of Indus-
trial Chemists. '

\

 

The I-ndustrial Chemistry depart-
ment of the University has recently
completed a series ~of

100 per cent. of the ;world’s orange
crop can‘ be utilized in commerce.

Not long ago in one of his lecture
Prof. Duncan gave us the following
statistics on the orange crops of the
United States yearly:

California oranges, value $28,317,000’

loss $424,750; per cent. 1.5. 1
California lemons, value $4,780,000'

loss $358,650; per cent. 7.5.

Florida oranges, ‘value $9,000,000; loss

$630,000; per cent.‘ 7.

With such a report of loss in the
crops it can readily be seen the value
that these. experiments will be to the
growers of the citrus fruits.

The processes for
the juices is not costly, and it produces
thelpure juice of the fruit minus those
dangerous preservativesused in most
of our foods at present.

The skin is used by extracting the
oils and preparing a ﬂavoring sub-
stance, perfumes and camphor. A1‘
these things were previously needless

_waste products.

 

SENATE MEETS.

A meeting of the Student Senate“
was held last Friday morning. This
was the first meeting since the elec-
«tion of the new senators and all
classes were well represented. Re"
pnorts were presented from ‘the various
committees, which have been "work-

ing, and other matters of importance:
were discussed. At the conclusion of

the meeting the senate adjourned to
the steps of State Hall, where the pic-
ture was taken for the Owl. The next
meeting will be held Friday morning
at 10 :30 o’clock.

 

RECEPTION. WELL ATTENDED

 

The reception held last Friday even-
ing for the senior classes of Allegheny
McKeesport and other High" schools
proved another success.

the evening, at the conclusion o~f.which
refreshments were served. The latter
part -of the evening was spent in danc-
ing. A member of the Student Senate
said in an interview concerning the re-
ception: “It is my opinion that these
s-ocials have done more than anything
else to foster a true kindred spirit be-

tween the young people of this vicinity .'

eral agent in the Pittsburgh oﬂice-of

ance Company. Mr. Scovel was grad-
uated from the College of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in 1883, and he’
has always taken a lively interest in
the affairs of his alma mater.‘ His last
appointment followed a resolution on
the part of the company to devote
more attention to the newly developed
fofms of‘ business insurance and
monthly incomes. As Mr. Scovel is 2
recognized specialist in these phases
of the insurance business, and has had
much valuable experience as a lawyer
and man of affairs, the company
has doubtlessly ma-de a wise choice in

‘ selecting him to ﬁll the new position

Mr. Scovel gained na'tional reputa-
tion as president of the National As-
sociation of Life Underwriters during
thetroubled times in the insurance
world in 1905-6. He was also founder
and for several years, chief editor of
“L-ife Association News.” Al-
though a very busy man, Mr. Scovel
ha-sialways taken a lively interest in
educational and cultural matters. He
has served the University of Pitts-
burgh as secretary of the board of
trustees and as executive secretary in
of the memorable three-day
celebration -of the one hundred and
tenth anniversary in 1897. He was also

By Prowler.

 

When the editor of this paper ﬁnally
selected me as the victim of his wrath
and sentenced the co'nduct of this de
partment upon myJpoor self, I ex-
torted one promise. What do you sup-
pose it was? VVell, we are not anxious
to operate a «puzzle picture, so here is
the answer. That The Prowler be ex-
cused from any discussion concerning
the proposed student building.~ '

The building project has been so
conspicuous during the past two
months, that it is really commonplace
and trite in interest. There have been
talks by the Chancellor, the deans and
the professors, but precious little stu-
dent sentiment. And, that is the ex-
cuse I offer for breaking. the pledge
-the editor so kindly assented to in the
beginning.

It has been my pleasure’ to asso-
ciate very closely with a number of
representative students in the last few
days, and I have learned a great many
things. One man, a Senior, is preju-
diced, because he thinks the movement
is not spontaneous; another chap, :
Sophomore Senator, believes -the ‘time
is not ripe for such a building; Stlll :

ful (and I hope there will be many
hopefuls) over the campus, and point-
ing to the student building, say: “Son
your dad helped to erect that one.”

Do you get my point now? Do you
see that petty objections of t-0-day are
mere tr-iﬂes when compared with the
glory of to-morr-ow?

Of course, there are difﬁcul-ties in
the way. Most assuredly, the-Chance1-
lor wants the building. Certainly, the
time is not quite ripe. Granted that
the only way to get money is to ask
for it——call the" process begging or
whatever you choose. I

But, do these outweigh the splendid
satisfaction of knowing you were a
builder of the University» of Pitts-
burgh. To-day is the appoinrte-d hour
to—morrow is too late. '

THE ANNIVERSARY.

the completion -of all preparations for
the coming anniversary "celebration.
Within this limited time -much -work
must be done. To the students will
fall the responsibility for a large share
of this work. The ﬁnal success of
the celebration: will depend upon them
In practically all the major events of
the -week, students will be the leaders
In -the opening torchlight parade and
cap—night celebration, in the ‘historical
play, in the procession on Wednesday
in the Alumni- and Undergraduate
-‘banquet, and in the Musical Concert
the students will be the most promi-
nent actors. The faculty, alumni and
trustees will be unable to make this
celebration ‘a success without the
hearty co-operation of the students.

With so much responsibility resting
upon them, the undergraduates must
exert every power at their command
to make this celebration such a suc-
cess that it.will go down i-n the his,-
tory of the University and the City of
Pittsburgh as the great landmark ir
the advance of education. This is none
too h'gh a standard to set. It is one
which can be fully realized by the stu-
dents if they so desire. Our large stu-
dent body of nearly two thousand is
without the least doubt capable of
making this event a wonderful suc
cess. All that is needed is work. And
the time for that is now here. Every
day more students are needed for the
manydifferent activities which are to
be carried on during the week of the
‘anniversary celebration. Every mar
who desires to help should give his
name to one of the members of the
executive committee. In this manner
each undergraduate will be given
some part in the celebration. ‘Only
once in a lifetime does such an op-
portunity come. None should fail to
take full advantage of it.

MUSIC.

The student assemblies held in Thaw
Hall have been unwarrantly disturbed
during the past few "meetings by some
person orpersons gently striving to
entertain those assembled with some
popular “hit,” either sung or whistled.
Of course those assembled enjoy such
proceedings very much, providing they
are delivered at the right ‘time and the
performers are talented. However, as
anyone present will vouch for, chapel
hour is not the time for such hilarity
and the performers cannot be com-
mended for their training.‘ Therefore
to please those who are trying hard
to do what is right, it is the duty of
the guilty ones to cease such uns’tu-
dent—like maneuvers and either attend
Chapel or at least forego their warb-
ling.

ANNOUNCEMENTS.

It is necessary that sufficient an-
nouncement be made concerning lec-
tures and courses to which people out-
side the University proper -rare ad-
mitted. During the last few weeks
many persons have come to the Uni-
versity to attend meetings of various
organizations and have had difﬁculty
in ﬁnding the rooms in which the re-
spective meetings were held. This

trouble which they meet in finding
their meetinglplace is one which
could easily be removed. A bulletin

of all lectures to which outsiders are
admitted and all meetings of organiza-
tions held in the University building
could easily be kept in each building.

Another _way in which announce-
ments of meetings can be placed be-
fore the public is to send notices of
such meetings to the Pitt Weekly. A
regular calendar -of all meetings for
the week is kept by this paper and
all -organizations or persons «desiring
to hold meetings should announce the
date, hour and room in the Calendar
of this paper. This applies especially
to student meetings. Very frequently

a

"notices are -read .at_-chapel which have

never been ‘posted in the Weekly’s
Calendar; . If the students desire. to
make their‘ meetings a success, to
have them well attended, they should
do their share‘ toward advertising
them. .We trust that hereafter no dif-
ficulty will be experienced in regard
to securing a complete Calendar for

each week. _ -

. ANNIVERSARY “TICKETS.

All students desiring tick-ets for the
Musical Concert and the Historical
Play are urged to -order them immedi-
ately. ‘ Reservations for almost hal"
the seats are now in the hands of the
executive committee and it will be
necessary for all students to send in
their orders as soon as possible.’ It is
the desire of the committee in charge
to make" these events largely student af-

fairs. ' Every eﬁort is being made to

favor the Alumni and students. ‘But
if t'he undergraduates do not hasten
they will ﬁnd no tickets left for them
Let no student intending to attend
these functions delay in ordering his
seats,

RESIGNATION.

Pittsburgh, Pa., Feb. 13, 1912.
My Dear Edirtor-in-Chief:

MM]. 1302;

Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

The little stage thunder which the
Sophomores used last Friday when the
Freshmen were having their pictures
taken for the Owl was effective in pro-
-ducing in its own way a little spirit
——something that is rapidly growing
to a great extent in our University
We h-Qpe that we will have more class
fights but not the ‘personal enmity and
ﬁghting which was prevalent in that
one last Friday.

Yours respectfully,
A Well Wisher.

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir:—In regard to the -disturb-'
ance last Friday morning between the
Sophomore and Freshmen classes I
wish -to state that I heartily disagree
with the members of the faculty in
acting as they did. It is my opinion
that such affairs should n-ot be inter-
fered with unless‘ property is de-
stroyed. Faculty members and others

claim there is no spirit here and that

it is impossible to arouse enthusiasm
over school affairs. Why is it then
that these things which tend to pro-

duce spirit more -than anything else‘-

should be treated in such a manner?

Yours truly,
Soph.

Mr. Editor

In regard to that disturbance on
last Friday when the Freshmen were
having their picture-s taken, I wish to
say through the Weekly mail box that

‘it is an absurd a-ttistude that the fac-

ulty assumes each time anything
starts. The only way we can make
school spirit is to get the students in-
terested in colle e. This cannot be

done as long as t e-men must refrain.

from any class spirit -or demonstration
of any kind. If nothing goes on here
we will never have any tales of college‘
life to tell our children when we grow
up.
too much time is given to classes and

n-ot enough to development of the
inner depths of a boy’s nature.
Sincerely,
A Soplh.
Mr. Editor: I

There has been cons.iderable com-

'ment on the action taken by the au-

thorities in regard to the disturbance
created by the Sophomores Friday
morning when the Freshmen were
having their pictures taken. I think
the attitude taken by a few of the
pr-ofessors in regard -to this was un-
necessary and that if it were not for
an occasional outbreak on the part 0’
the S0p»homores,,the spirit of Pitt un-
derclassmen would be entirely lacking.
Each class wants to boast of its own
achievement. Yours, ,
Observer.

Gold and Blue Basketball Artists Making Fine Record-Mt.
' ‘Union and Westinghouse Clubs Defeated-

The Westinghouse Clubhouse in
=’Wvilkinsburg was the scene of two
lively battles w'hen Pitt met Mt. Union
last Friday night, and the Westing-

house Club team the following night.
Both games were hard ones, but the

Bitt ﬁve had much more trouble
Tdowning the local ﬁve than the Alli-
ance team. The winning of this game
was the ﬁfth straight victory for Pitt
.and made a total for the season of 7
.won and two lost. This is a‘ splendid

record and t'he team deserves much

better support from the student body
than «they are getting. A mere hand»
ful, of Pitt men attended the lastgtwr
games while the numbers cheering or
the opponents could be reckoned ir
Wake u.p, Pitt men; 9

rest of the scheduled games.
Remembering the close game at Mt

iUnion during the early part of the

season, the Pitt players vworked hard
in order to keep the Buckeye boys
from evening up and the superiority of
the local boys over the Ohio ﬁve sur-
prised even their most ardent ad-

mirers and was atribute to the coach-

ing of Dr. Flinut. Pitt took the lead at
the very start of the game and had
such a comfortable lead that Captain
Campbell placed four su-bst:i«tutes.ir~
the game before it was over. Mc-
Dowell and Harley Campbell lead in
goal shooting as usual, while Frish-
man, from guard position, tossedfour
goals in from the ﬂoor. The lo-w score
-of the Mounts was not due Ito poor
shooting, but rather to a lack of that
necessary requirement. Campbell and
Frishman had their opponents we_ll
covered up during most of the game
and few tries from the floor were ne-
gotiated. McDowell outplayed Gibson
the star of Mt. Union, which had much
to to with Pitt’s victory. Brady
Broido, Heiner and Bane were substi-
tuted in the second half and d-id their
share of playing:

The game between the Westing-
house Club ﬁve and the Pitt ﬁve
aroused much interest in Wilkinsburg
and a large and enthusias-tic crowd
turned out to witness the struggle
The greater majority of the audience
pulled hard for the manufacturing ﬁve
-while the Gold and Blue “team did not
receive a single cheer. Pitt won, but

 

‘ Rooters ‘Should Attend Games

no credit is due the usually “loyal

'roo-ters.” -.

From a standpoint of team work the
last game was anything but satisfac-
tory and when a careful study is made
of the game it is a wonder that Pitt
won. McDowell, who leads the team
in ﬁeld goals, was unable to score 2
single point. Harley Campbell was
weak in shooting foul goals, getting
but 11 out of 23, and the -guarding was
far below par. Caprt. Campbell and
Frishman got their signals mixedisev-
eral times and went down the ﬂoor to-
gether, leaving the basket unprotected
and a “hanger” standing near it. Sev-
eral easy goals were made on this a-c-
count. Ochsenhirt put up a great
game at center against Hansell, who
outweighed him and had advantage in
height and was able to score one ﬁeld
goaL ' 4

The game was even all the way
through with a slight advantage in
Pitt’s favor. The score was tied ir
the ﬁrst half, which ended 18-15 favor
P'tt. Again in the second *half, the
score was «tied, ‘but Pitt managed to
gain a few points lead before the ﬁnal
whistle.

J. Brown and Lyford played the
best game for Westinghouse, scoring
all their points, but the guards and
center also did well. After the game
an informal dance was given, which
was much enjoyed by the players and
club members. The club is to be con-
gratulated on the good management of
the game.

W. & J. A LITTLE PREVIOUS.

According to Pittsburgh papers, Dr
Kirchner, the Physical Director at W.
& J., announced a dual in-door track
meet between Pitt and W. & J. Ilt-is
not known just how the report got
out, but Dr. Kirchner would hardly
hand such a story to the papers. The
management took up the matter of an
outdoor andan indoor meet, but when
the conditions of an indoor meet were

learned, the matter was immediately

dropped. .

Lt is just possible that an outdoor
meet at Washington will be arranged
but this lies in the hands of the W. 8*
J. authorities. It may be stated, how-
ever, that the report of arrangements
for a -dual indoor meet is unfounded.

start over again and live a good life.
It gives me great pleasure to be able
to point people -to the way that is open
to live‘ anew and better life.

“It is wrong to think that because
God is great that he does not take
There is a
law that says weakness is" strength. In
the hospitals there is weakness, but
the hospitals ho-ld «the purses of the
rich. Take the story of the prod-igal
son; it is a story of the law of‘weak-
ness is strength. '

“Running between man and God is
the law of weakness governing
strength. God is the Father and we
are the -pr-odigals. The material needs
of man are provided for by God by
discovery; God provided for the so-
cial needs of man, and God _will pro-
vide for the spiritual needs of man.

“If you will only come to God, God
will bless and guard you, and -will de_-.

you must give the world your -best

better off for your having given your-
self to it."

MORROW SPEAKS ON

attentive interest to Mr. Morrow’s re-
marks. _ - I

The speaker said in part: “It is al-
ways a pleasure to receive applause
but with me it has a depressing effect
because I invariably think. of my poor
self. I should, perhaps, do violence to
my feelings on account of the lateness
of the ‘hour, but I assure you it was
all caused by delayed street cars.

“I am to speak to you on the sub-
ject of Lincoln, than whom no greater

man, including George Washington

-preferably

an at, '1_5i’:r~"r wesiitrger‘

has ever lived. Abraham Lincoln was
famous because he represented four
fundamental principles of life: Large-
ness of common sense; honesty of
purpose; simplicity of manner, and an
abiding love for humanity.”

Perhaps the most interesnting feature
of Mr. Morrow’s talk was the graphic
recital of the incidents connected with
the immortal Gettysburg speech de-
livered by Mr. Lincoln. The intimate
touch given the account by Mr. Mor-
row enabled the students to gain an
added grasp of the character of the
Great Commoner.

The comparison drawn between the
eloquent oration of Edward Everitt
and the homely truths of Lincoln's
lines was especially effective.

In conclusion ‘Mr. Morrow impor-
tuned ‘the students to emulate the
splendid example of Abraham Lincoln.

The North Side superintendent was
given a rousing ovation at the end of
the speech by the students. Mr. Mor-
row responded with a clever express-
ion of thanks. -

HUDSON LECTURES TO

fore the Journalism Class on “Edi-
torial Policy,” Monday evening.

Mr. Hudson described the difference
between the news columns and the edi-
torials, by stating that the news col-
umns contained facts, whereas the edi-
torials were concerned only with the
discussion or criticism-of these facts

were contained 1-11 the same issue in

ly instructive.
