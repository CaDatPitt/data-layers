Draft Boards Target  
Of March Offensive

by BOB GING
Staff Writer
In a newsletter this week. the

New Mobilization Committee an-
nounced its plans for the March of-

- fensive to stop the war.‘ March is

to be anti-draft month, and the tac-
tics this month are all directed at .

the draft boards across the nation.

Scheduled the week of
March 16-22. the demonstra-
tions are aimed at showing sup-

for

port for an all-volunteer army.

\\V,

According to a spokesman from
the Pittsburgh Resistance. the
Armed Services Committee will
hold Congressional hearings be-

ginning March 14‘ on the recom- '
mendation of the Presidents Ad- ,
' visory Committee on,the Draft _-

that an all-volunteer army be im

" plemented. . — - —

One of the activities scheduled

for Anti—draft Week. according to‘

‘ organizers, will be a ‘peaceful and

legal ‘harassment of local draft
boards. Some of the tactics sug-
gested ‘for this harassment by the

Resistance spokesman’ were to’:

send your local board a daily
health report. since the draft‘

board requires all eligible men to-.
"inform them of any condition

which might change their draft

-— status. .

, board on matters which may been
relevant to you or-them. and visits

*9

By sending a daily reportfthe
potential draftee permits the
board to have acomplete and up-
to-date record on his physical con-
dition.‘ It was also mentioned that
the boards are required to file all

personal correspondence from 

candidates.

Other tactics suggested were R"

polite and friendly calls, to your

to the board. Q . ._ N

Anti-draft‘ Week also will be
highlighted by a LOTTERY of its
own. This lottery’ will be quite dif-

. ferent though. as compared to the
.‘.,_one, implemented by the current

administration last fall. In this lot-
tery. the names of all members

Biochemistry Department

Holds Open House

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff Writer

The newest department in the
College of the Arts and Sciences
is opening its door (and its arms»
to new recruits.

The Department of Biochemis-
try. formerly limited to graduate
students. will hold an open house
in the Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH) next Friday from
2-5 in Room A-719.

According to Dr. Mike Vaughan.
associate professor in the school.
the Biochemistry deals with such
important areas as molecular bio-
logy (the study of components
DNA and RNA), reproductive pro-
cesses and the development of
contraceptives.

“Pollution is a biochemical
problem,” said Vaughan, as is the

. study of genetic diseases.

‘ "Although doctors can diagnose
hereditary diseases. such as hem-
ophilia." he continued. "they can-
not cure them.-“ The role of the
biochemist lies in finding out how
the mutation of human genes
comes about.

Almost all the research in men-
tal health in the University is fund-
ed by the National Institute of
Health. an agency of HEW. he
went on._

resounded into melodies a nd
rhythms that said jazz. Last
Thursday night. for two hours. the
Tommy Lee Quintet explored the
sounds of John Coltrain. John Pat-
ton. and some of the quintet's orig-
inal compositions.

The quintet. with Tom Lee on
electric flute. Kenny Fisher on
sax. Don DePao1is on electric pi-
ano. Howard Russel on bass. and
Tony Fountain on drums. started
with Kloss’ "Children of the
Morning." a quiet bossanova.
Kenny Fisher featured in “Nai-
ma" with his slow mellow sax.
feeling through the melody.

John Patton’s "Latona" brought
excitement from the audience and
Afro-Cuban rhythms soared
through the Ballroom. The quintet
performed Don DePaolis’ “Pus-
sy." a bossanova of only 15 bars
and an untitled tune in 7 4 time
by Tony Fountain. “Here‘s That
Rainy Day." featuring flute and
piano. was the only standard that
the quintet played.

The most innovative of the se-
lections was “Siddhartha-Consci-
ousness,” a challenging jazz num-
ber that breaks rhythm style, with
5/4 time patterns in the middle of
the composition. At the end of the
composition, Tom, Kenny, and
Don were featured.

With the jazz experience over,
Tommy said. “We were really
pleased with the great turnout,

because our musical success and

interpretation depends upon peo— *

pies’ reactions. We really dug the
people sitting around our feet, tap-
ping their feet, smiling, and listen-
ing. Our music is basically spon-
taneous and as free as we feel it.
We limit rehearsals to the time
needed to learn the simple melodic
line, then we just feel each other
out while were performing.”

_ Monday, March 9, 1970. Daily
Paradox. Written with the idea

I" ._that that was a good-bye, I’ll

be*seeing you, never, as the
‘ } Associate Editor.

— But too much of a part of me
 was left unsaid. Too much.
_._‘ ‘About the’ people I experienced
' ‘V during three and a half ups and
 -- downs _years with The Pitt News.
I ‘A Sunday, Monday, and Wednes-
day deadline. And about -the
Speed of Time. '

. -. qA good-bye without a -Thanks
 For The Memories is no good-
 bye at all. It’s like Abraham
A‘ Lincoln once said: “You can
‘  fool some of ‘the people all of
l L. the time, and all of the people
some of the time, but you can-
- not fool all of the people all of
the.time.”

;, -. How can ‘I forget the night
., .- last year when the then News
_Editor David Tiernan and the

Associate Editor George Lies
called my apartment during. the

 

wee hours, about 2:00 a.m. The ,

two Wohlfarth’s tenan_ts had one
9- too many and somehow decided
to make like a bird. Southbound.
Florida, at least. But how
could they leave without the as-
 surance that someone would go
if-‘v--§to Berger Printing Company to

 ;, asked on the telephone, half-
F awake and less than half-believ-
 I _ing them. “You’re going where?"
.7.  Well, George and David nev-
' -‘er quite made it to Miami
- .'Beach. They stopped at a How-
ard Johnson's near the -Bedford
4 exit offthe Pennsylvania Turn-
,, » * ,pike for some coffee that didn't
* wake them up ‘til.the next morn-
ing; And by then’ they had
9: "* enough sense to come back to
’ where they started from.

And so The Pitt News'perren-

ial, George, continued to write

" "From The End Of The Bar. In

Marc was more than a Hack.
A politician. Leader of the camp-
us FARCE Partyin, last year's
Student Government elections.
The victor. In a relative vote

I count. He“ credited himself_ with

all the votes not cast.- a, rather .2
Silent Majority. ‘

And as a columnist he was
superb. The Pitt News Political
Science expert a la Russell Bak-
er. In Reflections Of The Spleen
he analyzed what the three pre-
sidential candidates said in inter-

‘views -held during the 1968 na-j

tional election campaign. “What'
they said may interest you." he

admitted. referring to the ‘re.-.

marks of Richard Nixon. Hub-

ert Humphrey. and George Wall-

a'ce. “but then again.- so may

the Boer War. if you know what ‘
Imean."

That was like Marcjeading
Bruce Levenson's mind. Bruce.

vid’s original Associate Editor.
From clean—cut to Freak. He
transferred to the New Univer-

climb on a chair,
write on the top of the wall in
the’Editor's Office. “The revolu-

tion is over. It was won.“ And
when asked to explain. Bruce
declared‘. "It's all relative." V
And his discovery was a far
cry from the Bruce of thevyear

before. The politicaliactivist. The ‘
critic of Politicians. He.-tojo; .a_na,--

lyzed the presidential candidat-
es in the national elections. Like
Hubert Humphrey. about whom
he said. “Hubert Horatio Hump-
ty Dumpty has been called the

lesser of the three evils. This ba- -.
boon got to be where he is today;

by. virtue of his intellect. He has

a ‘clay mind. It can be easily.

bended. twisted. formed. and
reformed. Right -now it is de-
formed." ' '

The’ Different Drummer was

the target of Letters To The
Editor. ‘Criticized for immature

ate terms. lack ofrrespect for the

too was criticized for immature

How Our Readers See 

“Michael” Pays Taxes,
That’s Not Enough

Editor. The Pitt News:

Recently. I overheard a conver-
sation in the cafeteria. "Michael"
and a girl I do not know were dis-
cussing his problem. The problem
is that Michael. like thousands of

5' other young men. is eligible for the
draft and does not want to serve.
‘When asked if he felt that he owed
nothing to society. Michael gave
the standard reply: ."I pay taxes."

- I would like to ask Michael. you.
- Mr. Tiernan. and everyone else to
go back in time to 1940. What
would have happened. Michael. if
your father and the millions of
young men at that time had said.
"I pay taxes." and refused to
serve in the armed forces?-Where.
Mr. Tiernan. would you be today‘?
Editor» of a free newspaper? I
doubt- it. Where would you ‘be.
Michael? Living and doing almost
as you please? I doubt that. too. I
tend to think that. had our ances-
tors not been willing to sacrifice
their lives for the welfare of their
fellow human beings, you. with

your dissenting attitudes. would *

find yourself in a concentration

camp. at best. andunder a govern-

,_ ment that would make you do its
will.

Let us now look at the present

and the totalitarian forcesin ex-

istence. It seems safe to say that
some totalitarian forces are de-
sirous of enslaving the entire
world. World dominance is their
main doctrine. Russia and China
are now at odds over who will lead
the revolution. True. this is the
conservative viewpoint. Michael.
You -may not agree with it com-
pletely. But let me ask you this—

what if you arewrong‘? Are you so .

sure of yourself that you are will-V
ing to risk your freedom. your
very life. the lives of your chil-
dren. or your-fellow man? Who

' will you sell down the river?" It is

"just two years. Michael. Just two
years. Mr‘. Tiernan. and you can
ensure. in some measure. the
freedom‘ and the lives of yourself
and the people you claim to love.
If you are as full of love for your
fellow human beings as you say
you are. I think that two years of
some type of service to your fel-
low map is.not too much to give.
John W. Fahnestock. Jr.
— ' CAS. .1973

(Editor's Note: I served four years,
in the Air Force watching them test

million dollar aircraft and then re-
placing them with newer ones. So,
John, Michael ' can have two of
thosefour years!)

,Gorr_n_ley7 Owes Apology

Editor. The Pitt News:

Catching‘ upon last week's edi-
tions of The Pitt News while I
was gone. I was astounded to see
* an article by Bill Gormley actual-
ly praising the behavior of the Leg-
islature in the recent financial
crisis. _ ' - ' 
Not only were the-legislators
(with about five exceptions, not-
ably Gerry Kaufman and Leroy Ir-
vis) totally direlictin any~consider-

were elected to. do by allowing the
financial crisis to develop in the
first place and then .to run nine’
months of a fiscal year without

any budget at all for non-preferred _

finally reached -was the -world's

Give It Up, Jerry‘

Editor. The Pitt News:

In regard to the article on page four of The Pitt NewsMonday.
March 2. entitled Please Give Up, Jerry Gruebel. Please Grow Up!
Using the editorial page of The Pitt News to air vicious and slanderous
personal views (Officer Kucharik is a goddamn bastard and a pig) un-
der the guise of "editorial opinion." is both anathema to the very rules
of journalistic ethics which you so featly stress in your "letters policy."
and disgustingly immature.

‘If The Pitt News is. or is to remain. "One of America's Great. Stu-
dent Newspapers." it can't very well continue to find room for such
inane and otherwise simply poor editorials.

A very concerned reader.

Drama Critic’ I .
Let me beginbyclearing up some of’ the things"

I‘ve heard floating around about Rosencrantz and '

Guildenstern Are Dead. _ _ .
By virtue of its association with Hamlet, it may

A well exude the feeling that there is very heavy dra- '

kind of let out the fact that old uncle Claudius has
been playing around on the side with his mother (no
—not his mother . . . Hamlet's mother) . . . getting
tough? ’

It seems that dad’s brother swooped in while the
old king was asleep and poured some sort of poison
in his ear; While the body was still warm—the poor
boy’s mom and uncle (incest and adultery) hitch up
and find themselves confronted with a mixed-up kid.

Hamlet is now running around, muttering to him-
self. and for all intents and purposes has a problem
(wouldn‘t you?). The king and queen (low and be-
hold.) invite two of Hamlet's old friends to come and
stay at Elsinore (vintage castle) to see what they
can learn of Hamlets thoughts (in other words. they
think he's wise to them).

At this point the play begins with Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern winging their way (on royal de-
cree) to Elsinore. somewhat confused—for they

.don‘t know what it's all about. and in fact they are

pieces ofthis century. Tom Stoppard has taken pen

ful th’eatri'cal work. _ A’ ‘ ‘ '

. 4 An Intriguing Plot V

- In-ta style that probably insults every Shakes-
pearianihistorian that ever lived, the whole thing
goes something like this . . . Hamlet (son of the Dan-
ish King) is off cavorting somewhere when he learns
of his dad’s death. Upon returning home he has’

these visions (the ghost of his father‘ret.urns)* that . I

continually left in the dark. We see two anonymous
characters caught up in-a massive espionage with
no knowledge. of what lies ahead. They are contin-
ually waiting.
. ‘ ' » Play withina Play

Stoppard creates‘ a play within a play. as he
starts from without and gradually unfolds the
thoughts and feelings of Rosencrantzand Guilden-
stern——who in truth Shakespearevaguely sketched
in Hamlet.

Here we begin, to see tragedy within. With no rec'-
ollection-of the past, no understanding of the pre-
sent, and no knowledge of the future, they are two
lost souls. In an effort to passthe time, they make
unfulfilled exploration into their destinies, with a
passing of verbiage between them that echoes E1izi- -
bethan logic and overflows with metaphysical wit.

Stoppard calls forth Hamlet in Shakespeare‘s
tongue, and mixes Rozencrantz and Guildenstern's
pitiful wanderings in- his own skillful manipulative -
language that is rich and verbose with the lighest
redundancy and the most fantastic playfulness.__v -

The troupe of strolling players enter (called by

3Ha_mlet to enact the fatal scene for those at Elsi-

nore) and they too step out of Hamlet and into the
world of our characters, interacting between the
two as scenes intertwine. Theirs is a major contri- ‘
bution to the comic aspects of the play and a distinc-

= tivecommentary on the fate that comes to'all men.

_ In short we’ have two ‘men, caught up in a drama
of which theyhaveno understanding and little com-

prehension. Rules of chance are suspended, their

destiny is marked . . . and they have little control
over their fate, which they so little deserve and so
vaguely understand. ‘

 ‘And yet, through_ it all, perhaps it is their event-

ual death that brings to them final identity. Perhaps '.

 .- it is this very commentary on tradgedy that trans-
.in hand and created. from one of Shakespeare’s( fin- ,

cends the stage and leapsinto the 20th-century with

vividness and realism that we may sitback and
wonder, "Might we too be Rosencrantz and Guild-
enstern?" Could fate be the strings to which the

puppets are tied? ..

By MARTHA HARTLE.
Sports Editor

...Last year at this time, outgoing
Sports Editor Roy Jacobs expressed
little hope for the future of athletics
at Pitt. Jacobs completely refuted the
rah—rah optimism of his predecessors
and he sincerely felt that the sports
program here was doomed to “Pitt—
dom.”

...“.Without a doubt, this year (1968-

69) was the worst yet,” he stated em-
phatically. “The teams, didn’t just

lose, they got whomped . . . I cannot _

view the future with optimism,” he
continued.

,At that time, Jacobs may have had

good reason for his bleak forecast.

Both football and basketball had been
listed on the nation’s bottom ten
standings. The gridders had suffered
their third straight '1-9 season‘ under
Dave Hart, who “ resigned”_follow-
ing the 65-9 Penn State devastation.

The cagers fared no better. In the
first season under Buzz‘ Ridl, the
basketball team won only four games,
while ‘losing 20, including a humili-
ating defeat to Carnegie Mellon.

Other teams fared equally bad, as
only cross-country, rifle and track
posted winning records. There were
a few bright spots _here and there,
-such as Ralph Cindrich and Jerry
Richey gaining all-America honors,
Bryant Salter jumping 6’10’’ and
Dave Wessel drawing attention with

had reason for pessisimism.

How things have changed. What a
difference one year makes. As I com-
plete my year as sports editor, I see
only optimism for_ the Pitt_athletic
program. Varsity sports are on the rise.

..The year 1969-70 will not go down
in the school’s annals as one of the
greatest, record-wise. The Panthers
won no national championships.

We’ve had no all-Americans, yet. But I

this year was far more important than

any won-loss record or trophy can.

signify. The trophies came in the
form of respectability, spirit and re-
birth of pride. You can’t .measure
these things in the record books. ‘

The move toward respectability,
began with football in the fall, and
has continued on through the winter
sports. Carl _DePasqua and his young,

_energenic staff brought'Western Penn-

sylvania football back to-the Stadium
and the Panthers responded with a
4-6 mark that could have and should
have been 5-5. - I e »

Despite posting bigwins over East-
ern rivals. Syracuse, Army and Navy,

. the Panthers failed to gain _recogni-

tion in the Lambert Trophy polls. I

' guess »it’s hard for Eastern, writers

and coaches to accept the ‘fact that
Pitt is back. They hadbetter beginto

Next fall's grid schedule will be
rugged as usual. An eleventh game
will be added and it won’t be with
a patsy. But the Panthers will be able

to cope withit. All that talk of de-’

emphasizing that became popular last
year can be tossed aside, The grid-
ders_ can and will win against the
best football teams in the country. ,

Perhaps I’m‘ overly -optimistic, but '
I can’t help but look to a winning fu-

ture when DePasqua c_ontinues to sign

recruits of the caliber of ., Clair. Wil- .

‘son, Bob Medwid or Stan Ostrowski.

In basketball, the. forecast is also
a bright one. Buzz Ridl’s squad loses
only Mike Patcher and Jerry Causer
from a team that improved 200 per

-cent over last year. And one of the

finest’ ‘freshmen’ ’ teams in recent
years will'_move up to bolster the nu-
cleus of veterans. Look for continued
upswing in basketball_ and ‘a good

possibility for a post ‘season».to.urna-.

ment bid in 1971.

This past year also/‘saw’ the eligi-‘

bility of freshmen in allvarsity sports
but football and_ basketball. , Fresh-
men played key -- roles in“ soccer,
wrestling, cross country, swimming
and track. The grapplers improved»

‘from 3-6-3’ in 1968-69 to 10-4 this
season, with the Easterns -yet" to

come. And that improvement came

without‘ the services of all-America

they could very well do the
0 same again this year. Among the -
other, schools’ ‘competing. are all
the Ivy League colleges along
with anyone in_ the ECAC who
chooses to enter. The tourney
should feature almost 30’schools
from along the coast and 'inland.\'

According to Assistant swim-.
ming coach Dick Bradshaw. “We
can’t really predict how well we
willdo until we get there and,
start swimming. A lot- will de-
pend on whether Yale swims or
not. The boys who have ,the best
chance are Al Morris, and’ Rick’
Rowe along with the relay team.
They‘ve done the best times.“

In addition to the 13 events
that are -competed for in the
dualmeets, the mermen will have
to contend with a 400 yard indi-
vidual medley, 100 yard races

The Cubs have just completed
a 10-6 season. After an initial
they finished in a
gallop. .

Grgurich’s green cagers flop-

ped in their first three starts.

However, they lost to only Duq-
uesne, Robert Morris, and West
Virginia during the remainder of
the year. Duquesne defeated the
Cubs by only a basket in the
Civic Arena. If the_ Dukes had
received just less charity toss-
es (the Cubs took only 16 free

throw attempts compared to Du-

quesne’s 35) Grgurich’s squad
might’ve made a clean sweep of
Al Bailey’s Little Dukes.

In the Robert Morris and

lWest Virginia defeats, only a few

points separated the Cubs from

‘their opponents. They also held

the lead within the final two
minutes of both contests.

Probably the Cubs‘ most

_memorable game of the season

was the 88-85, victory over Duq-
uesne. The outcome was in
doubt until the final minute de-

All-Campus V7restli1tg Tourney
To Expand After. Good Year

by VINCE DiNARDO

The championship bouts of the
All-Campus wrestling tourna-
ment were held last Wednesday
night at the Pitt Field House
wrestling room. Leo Bemis, IM
director, "was pleased with the
response and the quality of the
matches". According to Bemis,
"the competition was very good
and the enthusiasm displayed
was encouraging".

Tim Plez emerged as the cham-
pion of the 120 weight class as
he defeated Rich Loptosky on a
decision. In the 130 weight class,
Ken Hopes beat Art Havko to be-
come the champion. Both these
men were surprised finalists and
were both darkhorses in the tour-
nament.

Reposky, another surprize fin-
alist, was beaten by Rich Cross

/ round.

at 140. Cross was one of the fin-
er wrestlers in the tournament.

Matt Rudinsky, the Dorm
Champ, decisioned Gim Grant
in one of the many tight match-
es of the night. This match was
a good -rough display of ‘ wrest-
ling. .

In a rock-em-so'ck’em match
at 160, Vince Corsi beat Doug
Hochn. This rated as one of the
most exciting matches of the
whole tournament. Hochn dis--
played a lot of offense in the
match and Corsi resorted to a
defensive game.

Jim Ayers, the 170 champ,
did not have to wrestle as he was
declared the champ after the firs

r

Bob Thompson, the dorm

champ, was pinned in the 180
match.

At 190, Bill Snee escaped with
less than 5 seconds left in the
match to score the only point
of the match and enabling him

to become the Winner over Skip ,

Frenzel. Joe Spicko quickly
eliminated Tom Porecca, the B"
champ, and became the heavy-
weight champ.

Bemis wouldlike to make this
tournament a big campus event
and is trying to improve the
tournament. His success will
depend a lot on the response
he receives. The immediate
need is a portable mat.
this, Trees Hall becomes a pos-
sibility for next year’s event.
Next year’s tournament prom-
ises to be an even more excit-
ing event than this year.

With.

recognition in last year’s East-A

erns were Ralph Cindrich, who
placed first in the unlimited
weight class, while Bob Kuhn
placed fourth at 160 pounds.

Mark Payne was expected to
challenge for top honors in the
tournament but he was kept out
of the tournament at the last
minute by an illness.

Payne will be participating in
this year’s tournament, but Cin-
drich’s appearance is extremely
doubtful. He sustained a knee in-
jury in football and has not
wrestled this season. '

Last year Pitt placed ninth,
with 22 points, surpassing in
the top ten only Harvard, who
amassed only 16.

Navy, Army, Lehigh, and Penn
State took the first four positions,
followed by Princeton, Temple,
Penn, and Syracuse.

Tickets for the tournament are
available by contacting the Penn
State ‘athletic office. Tickets are
$7.50 apiece.

The first matches will begin
Friday, with semifinals on Sat-
urday afternoon and finals Sat-
urday night.

Details and line-ups will ap-
pear in Fridayjs Pitt News.

Also available on tape.

Season Opens April 

Mitt Team Still Indoors

With the opening game more
than three weeks away baseball
coach Bobby Lewis still has a lot
of slicing to perform on his 1970
roster.

A couple weeks ago there were
57 guys vieing for spots on, the
club. Lewis has that number down
to 35 now. but he still has about ten
more players to cut.

The coach would like to get his
squad outdoors before making his
final selections. but the weather
hasn‘t been co-operating. The clos-
est the team comes to actual out-
door conditions is in the batting
cage which has been set-up in the
Field House. Players use a pitch-
ing machine and take their swings
in a netted surrounding.

A lot of new faces will make the
mitt line-up this spring, as Lewis
has only nine lettermen returning
from last year’s squad.

These returnees include the top
four pitchers from last year’s
team, and Frank Mincarelli, a
6’1", 170-pound left-handed hurl-
er, who sat out last season as a
transfer.

George Medich (4-2 last spring,
with a 1.64 ERA) leads the Pitt
mound staff.

The mitt batting attack will be
missing two of its better mem-
bers, however.
