Somebody’s indignant, mother
called the Pitt News oﬁice the
other day, and asked _what crime
her son had committed.

“Madam, I don’t keep an account
of your boy’s private" life!” coun-
tered Irv Kaufman, managing ed-
itor.

But she contended that her son —

had received a. summons demand-
ing his presence at the Judicial
tribunal for freshmen of the Uni-
versity. A

Even after Irv exp-lained to her
that all freshman men had re-
ceived such a. notice and that it
was merely at formal request to
attend an annual assembly, she
continued to protest.

“He’s a good boy,” she ‘insisted.

The lady just didn’t get it.

Honor Grnzdimtes
Must Fulfill List
Of Requirements

Inclusion in the honor roll pub-
lished in last week’s News does not
in itself mean graduation with hon-
ors, advises Dr. Stanton 'C.‘ Craw-
ford, dean of the College. 3

“The requirements for honor
graduation involve more than a cer-
tain point average,” he said. These
requirements are set up by_the stu-
dent standing committees of the
College. The recommendations of
the committee are then submitted
to the faculty at a meeting held
sometime prior to graduation.” ,

“,Among the general requirements
for honors,” stated Dr. Crawford,
“are a certain percentage of A’s
and B’s, and no D’s or F’s.”

The student standing committee
of the College is an appointive
group. Erle Fairﬁeld, professor of
modern languages, is chairman.
Other members are Dr. M. M. Cul-
ver, professor of mathematics, and
VV. J. Martin, assistant professor of
history.

Engineers Will Dance
At Mosque this Evening

Members of the Engineering as-
sociation will set the pace for the
Thanksgiving recess period by
sponsoring a dance Wednesday
night at Syria Mosque from 9 to 1
o’clock. H. Gee Skinner, E41, is
chairman.

Appropriate Turkey day decora-
tions are planned‘ for the dance
which is expected to attract many
students as they start their recess
period Wednesday afternoon. John-

Brashear Day

By Frederick Lange

Truly great men—men who are
humble despite fame—are very few.

The University can boast of hav-
ing been served by a truly great
man, John Alfred Brashear, acting
chancellor from 1901 to 1904.

He was a millworker who had a
h_obby——grinding lenses and study-
ing thestars. He had only a com-
mon education, but he had a dream
—. to build an ob.~:ervatory where
people of all kinds could look‘ at
the stars and listen to men talk’ to
them.

He made such accurate telescopes

Sherwood to Us

By Harvey ‘Lincoff

Robert Sherwood’s play, There
Shall Be No Night. played in Pitts-
burgh a few weeks ago. This is
not a review of the ‘play, but rather
a setting down of the ideas that the
Lunts passed across the footlights:
that Germany runs the world, that
it is wrong to ﬁght in war, and yet
everyone will and does ﬁght, that
we are all insane because measles
didn't kill us before we aged to
mental rot, and that from this pres-
ent chaos will emerge a man who
will ask “Why do we fight?” (and
that this question is a man's most

signiﬁcant progress since the begin- .

ning of of time).

I must confess that I never be-
lieved that Germany ruled Europe.
But Sherwood ijationalizes how easy
it is for Europe to believe or to
fear to believe this. I watch.ed'_Rus-
sia compromise the state that it
had stood for, and fall in line ﬁwith
the Gre‘ater_Reich. And when the
German consul said, “This too is in
Morn Kam!pf,” I believed him. It
wasn't true, but it “ﬁt.” How ter-
ribly great must Adolf Hitler be to
those who Jive about him. ‘We can't
see’ his giant proportions from here.

But what ifhe should bring war
upon the Americas. I always
thought that I "should be a conscien-
tious objector, but there in the “play
I saw myself m‘-imiced. An Ameri-
can atnbulance driver from Con-
necticut swore that he too would
be _a conscientious objector; but
when the Russians are flan.ding at
Vitpuri, and he is 0.fi¥ered,“a pistol,
he takes} it. Not bec'au‘s‘e.' of the
uniform that went with it, or the

. parade, or the slogan; there is none

of this.

It all happens in a school house,
alone, out of the world where no
one can applaud or condemn. Yet
he takes the pistol because . . . I
don't know why, he doesn’t say
why. Perhaps because there is
nothing else to do. Perhaps because
it maeks no difference whether he
ever leaves - alive - that - out - of-the-
world shore on the Gulf of Finland,
to return to the.-measly half dozen
people, in Connecticut who . care
whether he lives.or dies...‘ '
" No,‘ this man‘ from ‘Connecticut
was above the .“g1are‘-lure’A’~‘ of prop‘-
aganda, but he ‘ wasn't: a’bove~. the
insanity of, the men of our-age who
kriowi no reason for not killing or
being killed. . « 

Dr. Volkonnen tries to rationalize
this new disease. that; inzfests our
brain. Science saves the _lives of
people from, diphtheria .a'nd"measle_s
so that their bodies"ma,y die of can.
cer ;or_,thei_1; brains___ collapse with
insanity}, Forwithout the earlier
tribulations, the body" has no"re-
sistance to the “lousier” diseases
that come later. It’s‘ a playright’s
spectilation. it’s fantasy, but it ﬁts.

VVhy will we let ourselves ﬁght?
F'or sure, we will . Why do we let
ourselves be drafted into a college
of ﬁght? We aren’t being fooled by
brass bands and glory this time; we
built a defense against such cheap-
ness in the past twenty years . . .
only to ﬁnd that that isn’t what gets
us, that isn’t what we needed a de-
fense against. What is it then? Why
do we ﬁght?

Sherwood’s Valkonnen doesn’t
answer this question, but in the
question, itself, he ﬁnds our salva-
tion. Half a million bodies and six
and a half million spirits died in
the Finnish war. And each in death
asked, “Why do we ﬁght?” They
had learned that question, and they
will ask it of the next lunatic that
offers them a pistol. The lunatic
will hesitate, he will stutter, he will
not answer. And they shall turn
from him and walk away. “And
there shall be no night.”

What a tragic, beautiful, living
example of this is the Spain of to-
day. The Reds thought they were
ﬁghting for the bread that Franco
offered them and the Blues thought
that they were ﬁghting for the bread
that Franco was taking from them.
And now when there is no bread,
they are made to see that there is
no bread because no one sowed the
wheat. It is as simple as all that.
So now the Reds and the Blues
starve and weep beside each other
and ask, “Why did we ﬁght?” Last
month when the axis asked the
Franco government to join the war
against England, Franco turned his
palms upward, shrugged his shoul-
ders, and replied, “I can do nothing
with the people, they are insane.
When I tell. them_‘We mustﬁght,”
they ask “Why?”

Fiasco of Friday Morning:
Spirit vs. Bad Dlannors

CONVERSATION-TOPIC No. 1 this week-end on Frick
Acres, more than even the game itself, was Friday’s late-
lamented pep rally and how it developed into _'a ﬁrst class
display of street corner rowdyism under the label. of school

spirit.

That it was one of the most disgusting demonstrations
ever staged by a grouplof college students is a point that vir-
tually every student agrees upon.

We do not say all the -students, because there were some
who had a good time Friday morning. Some had a lot of
fun stamping and whistling and catcalling and throwing
hoots and cackles and boos and pennies at fellow students
who were attempting to pay tribute to the team.

We do not wish to take the space to go into a lengthy

censure of these students.

We feel that this has already

been done by a student body who drooped out of Memorial
hall Friday disgusted and ashamed.
We are interested in analyzing the factors responsible

for what happened. On
agreement.

this subject there is no uniform

Our opinion would line up the causes in somewhat this

order:

-Breakdown of the public address system, which
prevented any ampliﬁcation of speakers’ voices.

‘Exhibitionism of the Dent bloc.

Like the spoiled

babyat the high school party, the Dent students Friday
wanted to monopolize the spotlight of attention at all
times, refusing to let up for one instant to allow some re-

spect for the organized tribute to the team.

Ironic

enough, in so doing the Dents broke up ceremony honor-
ing a football team of which a Dental student is captain.
Aping of the Dents by a group of engineers on the

opposite balcony.

speeches.

A .  The organization of the students into fraternity, inde-

‘ pendent and school blocs throughout the hall hasbeen offer-

edgas a major reason. Proponents of this say that it, from
the ‘start, ‘created an artiﬁcial inter-bloc hooting contest._ A

"An\o'_ther theory states that the program itself was its"

_ worstenemy, emphasizing that speeches by students have

no’_-place at’pep rallies. "We ﬁnd it hard to accept this..in-

Conscientious Objeotors

‘Common Sense’ Columnist and
Letter W/riter.-Discuss Issues

By Gerald Ziskind.

Now that a number of New
York seminary students have re-
ceived a year’s jail sentence for
refusing to register in the draft, I
can hear the throbbing outcries of
our self-appointed liberals and “hu-
mane” social workers who throw
up their hands in horror at such
“dicta.torship tactics.”

I see with this case of challenge
transcending by far the immediate
signiﬁcance or welfare of the par-
ticipants involved.

I heartily endorse the sentenc-
ing of these students. Their gov-
ernment had already extended to
them the privilege of entering the
active military service. They sim-
ply had to afﬁx their signatures to
a national census, but even this
their “conscience”Awould not per-
mit. We have passed the time of
the social worker complex in deal-
ing with recalcitrants.

continent became extinguished.
They. were so pre-occupied to ca-

tering and soothing their dissenters‘

that they forgot to defend their
fundamental existence as free peo-
ples.

Were these ordinary things we
too would join the brigade of sym-
pathizers. We, too would partici-
pate in the luxury of tinkering
around with our democratic instru-
ments in an effort to right these
misguided youths. But we refuse
to stop and play while half the
world is in chains, while mad men
strike piercing blows at our free-
dom. As long as the on—rushing
hordes of Teutons crush out whole
cultures and disease entire genera-
tions with hate and bigotry and
lust, we refuse to indulge in dem-
ocratic luxury. Of course, we may
commit wrongs at home. We may
be less humane at home. But in
the process we shall have saved
our civilization.

This game ‘

By Alvin Malakoif ’40.
In his column on October 23, in

the News, Gerald Ziskind claims-

he retains a profound respect for in-
dividuality of character, “for the
man who can resist the mob.” But
he -cannot stand the “self seeking
obstructionist tactics of publicity
seekers” who refused to register
for the draft. He categorizes them
without qualm: they are neurotics
who cannot go along with the rest
of the country and register in what
is more than a census.

The “Senator” needs to examine
his facts. The registration was
scarcely “only a census.” To regis-
ter bound one over to obey a new
set of legal forms and laws; to reg-
ister obligated one, if so chosen, to
place army service paramount to
everything else forwten years as a
reservist; to register indicated ac-
ceptance of the belief that the state

, might set up boards to decide some-

thing that to the objector was a
moral and personal decision——

Further, Gerald dislikes the fact

Despite the emphasis on man as
a social being, there are still some
things which a man will act upon
as an individual. Some men will
refuse to commit incest, to abjure
their religion, to enter lifeboats be-
fore women and children, or to fail
to dress for dinner. Some men
will give up their lives rather than
perform one of these acts. Consci-
entious objectors refuse to kill or
aid in killing; or perhaps refuse to
admit the right of the state to con-
script the individual; or perhaps
refuse to ﬁght in what they regard
as an “imperialist war.” For these
matters of conscience they are will-
ing to give up their freedom, their
property, their citizenship, and pos-
sibly even their lives. Let those
who deprive them of these things
look to their own consciences. And
let Gerald Ziskind look to his own
conscience for the curious hypocri-
sy that leads him to admire men of
ﬁrm conviction in general, but not
in the particular.

Editor," the Pitt News:

Imagine if you can approximately
2,000 students, brimming over with
pep and enthusiasm, going to the
Memorial to inspire the Pitt football
team for their celebrated game with
Penn State. And then try to be-
lieve that almost every student with
some sense of decency left that as-

sembly with a feeling of shame"

and disgust at the actions of some
of their fellow students.

We never thought the time could
come when we would be ashamed
of our fellow students’ action. But

Instead of taking courses in dent-
istry and calculus we suggest that
some of you try a course in Com-
mon, Down to Earth, Good Man-

Engineer Seniors,  Trip F1115

Continuing’ the‘ playoffs -in the in‘-
tramural touch football division,
-the AE&ME squad handed the Chem
Engineer seniors an 18-0 white-
wash last Friday on Trees ﬁeld.

The boys did all their scoring in
the ﬁrst half. After receiving the
kickoff and getting nowhere on
‘three running plays, the AE&ME’s
punted to the opposite ﬁve yard line
where one of the Chem boys fum-
bled and the punters recovered. A

Holt in the end zone accounted for
the ﬁrst score. None of the’ attempt-
ed conversions were successful;

After the ﬁrst touchdown, each of
‘the teams took turns in intercepting
‘passes. But Winkler of the win‘-
ners hit pay dirt by intercepting a
lateral on the Chem’s two yard
stripe and dodging over" for the
score.

Stopping a scoringthreat on their
own seven, the AE&ME’s started
down the ﬁeld with a’ succession of
short pases. The scoring march was
climaxed with a pass from Holt,
standing on the midﬁeld stripe, to
'Mamaux over the goal? line.

A series of completed passes, with
Holt on the pitching end, brought

advantage of: it in the ﬁnal period
to score their only touchdown, but
by that time Pitt had 1-3 points’.

Just to vary things a little, guard
Ralph Fife was high scorer for the
day with a touchdown and two ex-
tra points on plac”e'men't kicks, but
the boys who kepta delirious crowd
of 31,000 on’ their feet were
George Kracum an,_c1‘Eddie._Jones.

Kracum galloped past 'State’s
right end on a fake reverse 40
yards to the Lion nine, then lat-
eraled to Fife for the game's ﬁrst
score. Late in the ﬁnal quarter,
with State frantically throwing pass
after pass, Kracum picked one out
of the air and raced .35 yards for
the last six—pointer.

While Jones contributed less to
the scoring, his whirling dervish
antics were a sight to behold. He
dashed from one-‘side of the ﬁeld_
to the other dodging tacklers, he
blazed a touchdown pass to Bob
Thurbon, and he gave the Lions’
left end a dismal afternoon trying,
to keep up with him.

Meanwhile, the Panther line kept
all but one Lion back, a will 0’ the
wisp speedster named Pepper Pe-
tiella, bottled up completely, and
except for Petrella’s sporadic
dashes and a few successful aerials,
State just couldn’t get going.

The lone Nittany , tally came
against a team composed chiefly of
reserves and was scored on a pass.
Otherwise, t_he Panthers stamped
themselves as one of the finest de-
fensive units ever to wear Blue and
Gold toggery. 1

It was almost 13 minutes after
the game began that Pitt hung up
six points. Previouslyl State had
failed on a scoring chance after
tackle‘ Platt recovered‘ Ernie Bo-
nelli’s fumble on the Pitt-s26. Full-
back Bill Smaltz passed incom-
plete into the end zone on fourth
down, and that was the signal
for the Panthers. to start rolling.

Jones and Kracum. made it ﬁrst '

down on.the Pitt 35. Bonelli bat-
tered to another ﬁrst down on the
Pitt 46.
but an exchange of punts made it
Pitt's ball on the State 49. Kracum

kicked out of bounds on the Phi

On the ﬁrst play Mitchell passed
to Bitner, who ran all the way to

mid-ﬁeld. Mitchell passed again,
but this time “Lefty” Ziolkowski
intercepted the aerial. Ziolkowski

dropped back and then passed over
the goal line to Milanovich for the
ﬁrst score. Ziolkowski’s pass in-
tended for Paffrath was too short.

After the li‘al‘f-time‘ rest Doc
Carlson’s‘ boys really became hot.

They had the Phi Gams bottled in
their own territory the whole pe-
riod, but they didn’t score ‘again
until Milanovich intercepted Mitch-
e'll’s pass and carried it to the ten
yiprd marker. Two running passes
failed, and then Kocheran shovel-
passed to Port over the goal for
their second tally. Kocheran again
passed to Port for the extra point.

Paifrath kicked off for the Punks,
and on the first play, Milanovich
intercepted Mitchell’-s pass. Ziol-
kowski passed again to Milanovich,
who was waiting over the‘ goal line,
and the game was over so far" as
the scoring went.

ithers were never headed.

Midway in the.third period Pitt
was off again. Kracum went from
the State 48 -to the 38 in two tries,
and Bob 'l‘~h"urbon, entering the
game for the ﬁrst time, swept over
guard to the Lion 18. A run fail-
ed to gain, and Jones went into ac-
tion. ~sHis first pass was knocked
out of the hands of Stan Gervelis,
his second—thrown on a dead run
-—went out of the end zone, but his
third was right down. the-center to
Thurbon who tookitv in front of
the goal posts. Fife placekicked
the extra point.

An intercepted pass gave State
the ball on their own 47 early in
the last period, and the Lions went
straight down the ﬁeld to score.
Smaltz passed to Patrick, Petrella
scampered to the Pitt 28, Smaltz
passed to Vargo, Smaltz passed to
Patrick again, and ‘then Smaltz
threw a 14-yard clincher to Krouse.
Pol.lock’s kick was good.

Pitt was off on another march
a few minutes later, but it -ended on
the State seven, with Jones’s fourth
down shot being grounded in the
end zone. Half a dozen plays after-
ward, State‘s fullback Brown threw
one from his own 21, but Kracum
was in front of it. Big George out-
maneuvered three Lion tacklers
and, with _Fife’s conversion, the
scoring was ended.

tutored millworker who taught him-
self to build special instruments for
studying the stars. _
“Uncle John,” fondly regarded by
all who knew him, made lenses for

telescopes in a workship near the _

old observatory when the Univer-

' sity was located in Allegheny; city.

With.,only a common education he
became one of the most famous as-

in 1901 when Dr. W. J. Holland
resigned. During_ his three __years
as acting head: of ‘the University,
Dr. Brashear assisted in building
up the School of Engineering an

Because of failing health and ad-
vice of friends‘. that “it wasswrong
