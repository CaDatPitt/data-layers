Irooms will be taken by members of
!the executive committee.

3 University delegates at their week-
lly meetings have been suggesting
Ibills which conform to a model state
llegislature form, but at the present

3 time the possibility of having the ex- A

Iecutive committee rescind their de-
lcision on the use of the model con-
istitution is being considered by the
;va:*ious college ICG groups.

 The students favor using the pres-
, ent constitution of the State of Penn-
lsylvania as a model, rather than
idrafting bills. according to a consti-
fttition not in use at this time.

I

, Attendance at today’s meeting of‘-—

Last Sunday 50 delegates from

W AS.5‘ER..\[.=\I\'I\' AND ’l'l7BERCL'LI.\' tests are again being olfered
ii‘9¥§ to l'nive1-sity students. according to information from the
Mons and \\'on1en's health services. That erstwhile prime "husl1-
hush" woi-d in polite vocabular_v—syphilis——and the even more
deadly TB seem to be deﬁnitely out of the taboo classification here.
\Ve congratulate Doctors Jamison and Carlson for their timely follow-
up on the highly successful health campaigns of last year, sponsored
jointly by The News and the health services. It indicates a progres-
sive attitude and provides a highly-important service to the student
body.
OT SO PROGRESS ‘CE. however. is the attitude of the James
administration toward the state health program, especially its
recently-announced plans to lock up the new State Tuberculosis hos-
pital at Butler upon completion of construction. The new Governoi-’s
assertion that there is no present need for these facilities has been
ably I-et'uter,l by persons well-informed on the subject. According to
Dr. Edith MacBride-Dexter, there are 45,000 active cases of tuber-
culosis today in Pennsylvania. only one-tenth of which are receiving
liospital care. \Ve join with Dr. Dexter in terming this plan of the
Go‘-/er'uo1-'s a serious case of “false economy." If that is economy,

were jniszt as content to remain in the spend-thrift class.
R(,)i’§'SE'\'El.'l‘ SIlOI,'LD RESIGN, publisher Frank Gannctt declar-

ed i'et-eiitly “with all curnestiiess and einphasis” in a speecli be-
.t'or<- the National Republican club. Mr. Gannett gave as some of his
I-c-:.i:aoIIs the usual verbiage indicating that the country is going to the
(lo«_g-s, that capital and business have been consisteiitly stifled, that the
coinmy is headed toward bankruptcy.

A bit of researcli by The Philadelphia Record uncovered the fol-
lowing: inforniation in line with the publisher ’s stirring a(l(l1'ess; “The
Gannett Company, lnc., of Rochester, N. Y., publisher of 19 news-
papers. reported on March 10 a net proﬁt of $]..].65,-_l15 for 1938, a

TIE EARLY SPRING LULL in athletic activity has always been a

problem to sports-lovers. About this time of the year it is custom-
arily too late for basketball and hockey. too early for baseball. and the
other sunnner sports. But a happy solution has been found, according
to last-minute news releases. It is the new sport of goldﬁsli-gulping.
Atliletic enthusiasts need no longer moan about forced inactivit_v.
’l‘l1ey will toss sulphur and molasses out the window and take goldﬁsh
tonic instead.

To our martyr of \V_vomissing Polytechnic institute. who holds
the current goldﬁsli-swallowing record, we extend our heartiest.
coiigratulatioiis. His name will soon take its place with the Abner
Doubledays. the Dr. Naismiths. with the imniortals of sport, who, too,
were ridiculed in their day.

Digest Editor Advocates Freedom

;Of Minorities in

By Fred S. Robie

Inqiliry Address

Real progress is accomplished by
freedom of minorities to try out their
ideas. according to Barclay Acheson,
Tassociate editor of the Reader's Di-
‘gest. who spoke at Inquiry Forum
;Monday.
“Normal progress is like the
, growth of a coral reef,” explained
Acheson illustrating with the growth
:of playgrounds in urban Chicago.
“Progress has always been accom-
jplished by a minority group which
iexperiments and then convinces the
imajority of its worth.”
 He divided the types of problems
lwe have to face today into two,
j“There are problems created by suc-
j cess and problems created by failure;
gmany of our problems are the for-
lmer.” He illustrated by the advance
of transportation creating a problem
in the horse and camel industry.
“Our ﬂexible, adaptable institu-
tions are making adaptations to prob-
lems which in other countries are re-

sulting in concentration camps. Su-
, per-imposed governments, as in Ger-
‘many, prevents any departures by
, minorities.”

“Real reforms come from the sub-
stantial strata of society. “Acheson
said and then he laughed, “Someday,
you’ll wake up with an idea; you’ll
be shocked, but others have survived

; it.”

Coach Bot ser
Seeks Fullback

Replacements

SOll".C‘.‘-.'ll€I'C amongst his squad of
forty-odd football candidates Coach
“Chisel” Bowser hopes to ﬁnd a full-
back who will follow in the thump-
ing footsteps of All-American prede-
cessor Marshall Goldberg.

Bowser hopes to complete the
treasure hunt before the wind up of
his spring training season. Holding
over from last season’s fullbacking
are Frank Goodell and Larry Peace,
who is ineligible for the spring foot-
ball practice.

 

At the scrimmage sessions which,
were held last Saturday and Monday 1

the board of strategy took steps to-
ward the solution of the tailback
situation. Ernie Bonelli, who last
year played halfback, was moved
over to fullback.

In his first attempts at progressing
the ball from the fullback position,
Bonelli kept the blocking brigade
-stepping. Ernie is one of the fastest
men on the squad, and relies on
speed instead of sheer power.

While the chief problem is the
fullback position, there are a number
of spots that still require plenty of
attention. The terminals, tackles, and
right half posts are up for more than
casual discussion by the coaching
staff.

Meanwhile Ed Jones, one of the
shining lights of last season’s fresh-
man team, has been spending his
spring training period with the
freshman baseball team. Jones will
do little football slinging this spring
(or perhaps even autumn); his ef-
forts will be conﬁned to ﬂinging a
baseball from the pitcher’s mound.

Trim Juniors

Rallying in the fourth period after
previously trailing all the way, the
freshman women’s basketball team
edged out the juniors, 29-27, last Fri-
day afternoon in the women’s gym.

The match was the second in the
women’s interclass basketball tour-
nament, the frosh having been de-
feated by the seniors, 31-22.

Despite their win, the freshmen
had to surrender high scoring honors
to junior Florence Ragan who ﬂip-
ped in 19 points, eight short of her
tea1n’s total. Jackie Fike, freshman
star, dropped 14 points through the
cords to ﬁnish as runner-up.

The frosh presented a better bal-
anced attack as Frances Fisher con-
nected for eight points, one more
than teammate Jane Anderson, while
Betty Coulson, second high point
getter for the juniors, hit the hoop
for only two ﬁeld goals.
