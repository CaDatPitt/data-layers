“fires up’ vandals-

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

The Pitt News came "hot off
the presses‘ Monday night—liter-
ally—when a number of issues
were set on fire. ‘

The burning took place around
7:15 p.m. in the Schenley quad-
rangle after the papers had been
removed from their news stands in
the Student Union and the Towers
lobby and placed in garbage cans.

Papers were also ripped and
piled in the cans.

Evan Pattak, associate editor
of the Pitt News, said that the
amount of papers burned could
not be estimated but that “the to-
tal number burned, ripped up and
no longer readable was substan-
tial.”

According to Wade Lawson. SA

Committees Commissioner. who '

was at the scene of the action. the
papers were gathered by "a group

of students extremely concerned ‘

about the decline the Pitt News
has undergone in the lastyear."

Lawson would not divulge the

names of those responsible for the ~
"action. He did, however, admit

that he played “an integral part"
behind the incident and that he
was acting as a "concerned stu-
dent."

“I was very much involved and
concerned about what happened,”
Lawson said.

- The missing papers were dis-
covered when, according to Pat-

tak, he and Bill Gormley noticed '

that the stands on the main floor

' ofthe Student Union were empty.

On their way to the Towers lob-
by to investigatetheyfound three
garbage cans filled with Monday’s
issues.

Gormley said he noticed a num-
ber of students “milling around.”

While Gormley and Pattak re-
trieved papers and returned them
to their stands. one garbage can
was ignited. Members of the Pitt
News staff _carried the remain-
der of the papers to the stands
after the incident.

Eyewitnesses reported that a
campus policeman was present
but took no action to halt the burn-
ing or commotion. A campus po-
lice spokesman described the in-
cident to the Pitt News as "noth-
ing serious." He had no addition-
al comment.

’Jeff Pasek, a student seen in
the quad at the time of the inci-

1 dent, said he was picking up a

‘number of the papers to give to

_'''those members of the WPGH

staff who were commuters and
may nothave gotten a chanee to

 

see the issue. Pasek also said he
-was “disturbed at the treatment
Demetri and others got in the pa-
per.” Pasek was referring to a
column in Monday’s paper cover-
ing the Social Commission and an
allocation for the radio — station.
Pasek also mentioned the story on
the drug arrests ((“Campus Cops
Arrest Nine on Drugs-,” page one)
was another cau__se of his concern.

Pasek described the articles

' published Monday concerning the

drug arrests’ and the column on

Constitution Committee
approves 7-man board

by GLENDA MINSHUL

The Constitutional Review Subcommittee Monday gave

ary approval to three proposals.

prelimin-

The group approved the proposal of a seven-member board to head
student government by a unanimous vote of the members present. Six
of these members would be elected at large without seat identification

for the undergraduate schools.

The seventh member of the -board would be chair person of the-
board. ‘elected also in a University’-wide election from a slate of can-
didates running for that particular office.

The second proposal approved by the committee was the distribu-
tion of the four seats in the University Senate allotted to the undergrad-

uate student body.

One seat will be taken by a representative from the School of Gen-

eral Studies.

The main question was the seating of the other three representa-
tives. After a spirited discussion, it was agreed that one seat would be
given to the chair person of the board and that the other two seats
would be ,assigned to the two board members receiving the highest

number of votes.

The third item passed by the seven members present concerns the
method of approving the allocation budget. V

The Allocations Committee would first submit its budget to the

the white rides past on a ski lift.”

The economic system, said
Bond. is more concerned with
property than people. "

"It is economics that makes the
black last hired and first fired. re-
’ceive six years of education after
attending school for 12. and main-
tain the highest mortality rate in
Vietnam," Bond said.

The way of the system, said
Bond,‘ is to make blacks and other
oppressed groups suffer—suffer
more at all times, good and bad.

To improve present conditions.

Bond said. “blacks must begin to
be serious about the method that
‘has been successful -for other

groups—lthat method being poli- '

tics. the second oldest profes-
sion.“

He termed politics as "who get
how much of what from whom."

election is not the political rela-
tionship between blacks and

seven-member board. A majority vote would be required to pass the
budget. If the budget failed to garner the necessary four votes. it would
be returned to the Allocations Committee. which could ‘amend it and
then return it to the board or return it without any changes.

The second time the budget is introduced. it would take two-thirds
of the board (five members) to reject it. If the budget is rejected a sec-
ond time. the responsibility of engineering the allocations budget would
fall to thelboard.

This method of approving the allocation’s budget was thought the
best means of insuring a system of checks and balances, which the cur-
rent Constitution does not provide.

The group also decided two procedural matters for the committee.
Any vacancies on the committee would not be filled. since it was agreed
that the work of the committee had progressed to the point that a new
member unacquainted with the total issues would be severely disad-
vantaged. _ V _

The majority necessary for passage ofthe proposed constitution
within the committee was set at two thirdsftseven votesr.

Following committee approval, the Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee must approve the entire proposed Constitution. Vice Chancellor
for Public Affairs Bernard Kobosky and Treasurer Dave Smith must
approve the section of the Constitution dealing with the allocations
budget. ’

After gaining this preliminary approval. the Constitution will be,
submitted to the student body in a referendum. tentatively set for Dec.'1.

The idea of a model lease, which
is being drawn up through the Ten-
ants’ Union has been given sup-
port by a local landlord who esti-
mates that nearly 35 per cent of

I ' his tenants are Pitt students.

“An open dialogue concerning
important.
There is no doubt that a good, fair
lease is a major step in the right
direction,” said Sanford Gold.

' Frank Little, who began work
on the Off Campus Housing Com-

  mittee and more recently, the
”  V Tenants’ Union, devised this mo-
del lease from ones already in use -

by local landlords and from guide-
lines set down in an informal pub-

sociation.
“Landlord - tenant problems
could be alleviated if the lease

, ’ were more specific, and devoid
' . ofunclear phrases,” Little said.

During a 4 p.m. meeting today

looked straight into yours in an-
swer to a question, thin lips that
housed an eloquent tongue.

A question lead Bond to elabor-
_ate his position on bussing. To
him, the issue is ‘tied to a more
important one of equal education.

Although many people believe.

public education should be con-
trolled by the state and federal
governments, Bond disagrees
with abolishing the local input
of property taxes.

"When people aren’t contribut- r

of the Student Association, the
Tenants’ Union members will try
to streamline the lease.

Gold has offered to have his
own attorney check the lease for
legality and suggested that the
Tenants’ Union employ a lawyer
available through the. Legal
Awareness Committee. '

‘,‘There should be a group of at-
torneys. who have some diversi-
fied opinions review the lease,
also,” Gold said. “Perhaps . a
judge, the Neighborhood Legal
Service and others.” ,

Little said that after an amend-
ed draft is completed, the Ten-
ants’ Union will samplelocal land-
lord reaction. ”

Gold expressed concern about
a possible polarization of land-
lord and tenant and said that it is
erroneous and dangerous to group
all landlords into one category,
and likewise students.

ing to the education of their chil-
dren, they lose interest.”

But, he added, “State and feder-
al funds should equalize the dis-
crepancies that the property al-
lows." _ ~

As it is right now, he said,‘ un-
equal property taxes provide uri-
equal education for children of
different neighborhoods.

' "But a court in California had
ruled that an unequal property tax
is illegal. Berkeley can't finance
better schools than Watts," Bond

ing director and advisor to the
Tenants Union, said that the idea
of a model lease is not only an ex-
cellent first step toward tenant-

- landlord understanding, but that it

establishes a credibility in the
Tenants’ Union with regard to
students.

Cowell said he feels that cur-
rent leases provide a lot of room
for arguments and disputes be-
tween tenants and landlords.

Little commented that some
lease data is still in use after 50
years. “The phrases ‘landlord will
provide steam heat’ and ‘you may
not bring packages in through the
front door’ are outdated. as well
as others.” he said.

Tim Ging, a member of the Ten-
ants’ Union helping to stream-
line the model lease, termed the
‘confession of judgment‘ clause a
‘kangaroo court.”‘

This clause deals with the land-
lord’s right to hire a lawyer to de-
fend a tenant with whom he has a

said.

“Every child has the right to
an equal education.'’ ’ '

He pointed out one advantage of
bussing.

“It is educationally beneficial-

for you to sit next to a white pupil.
Someday he will be a business col-
league or a neighbor. -

In answer to the question, “Are
black people ready to exercise
their political power?“ Bond re-
plied, ‘‘We’re ready, but we're
not able.

 Tenants’ model lease draws landlord support

court case,

Gold said. "I don't know of any
case where that clause was ever
used. I believe it is no longer val-
id. But since the court system is
so slow, a landlord would have the
clause to fall_ back on in case a
tenant would default monetarily._”

"The model lease,” added Ging,
"eliminates such unlawful provi-'
sions, substitutes legal technical
wording with something’ more
tangible. It clarifies references to
such law_s as the Landlord Tenant.
Act of 1964."

Neither Ging, Gold, nor Little
could explain the content of the.
1964 law and used this as evidence

 that neither students nor ‘land-
lords were aware or took the time

to investiage fully the content of
their leases.

Hence the model lease is plan-
ned to clarify both the rights and
responsibilities of both students
and landlords.

°EVcrytl1ing is political,’ claims Julian Bond

"There are still too many divi- —

sions among us. We are Demo-
crats versus Republicans, fools
versus genuises. We still carry
red, black. and green measuring
sticks‘: some of us are too black.
some of us are not black enough.”

"What we must begin to under-
stand is that everything is politi-
cal. When drugs exist in the black
community in Pittsburgh, it’s be-
cause politicians allow it to exist.

“When black people’s garbage ’

isn’t picked up, it’s because poli-
ticians don’t have it picked up.”

Bond went on to describe the
kind of political organization that
he has working in his district.

“I call my organization the 111
District Organization.”

“,It’s composed of people much
like your parents, who are moti-

‘ vated by what is good for them.

Usually this means good for the

gl‘0_lIp.

BOND:
Blasts unequallproperty taxes.

“If blacks _believed the white
man was in total control, then we
wouldn’t be getting up to work and
breathe every morning. If a
man’s kicking you with two feet,
it’s worth your while to at least
get him to stop kicking you with
one. Sure, there’s still pain, but
the pain would be eased.

Bond stressed that the way
things could change is organizing
black people politically. He cited
Mississippi as an example. Black

‘~ people there, he said, could have

more strength if they were more
"organized, if they were contacted.

“I touch people, shake their

’- hands, kiss their babies; People

want to see you, touch you. While
I..was campaigning many people
told me I was the first politician
‘they had ever seen in the flesh."

When the meeting finally ad-

journed a few minutes before his
scheduled speech at 3 o’clock,

' ’Bond stood up. His stylishly cut

navy blue suit appeared fresh,
without any wrinkles, even though
he had been traveling that morn-
ing. A politician’s politician to the
last, he stayed to talk to three stu-
dents. Bond was explaining, "Po-
litical power has to come from the
bottom up." .

Feminist groups unite

by ELLEN L. GANLEY
Night Editor

The women's liberation move-
ment is comprised of women of
many different political leanings.
According to author Robin Mor-

.gan these groups include women

involved in women's rights. the
women's liberationists and the
radical feminists.

Any many times. the different
contingents find themselves at
war with one another.

A group of Pittsburgh women is
trying to do something to bring
the city‘s women liberation move-
ment together. Their project. and
brainchild. is the Pittsburgh
Women's Center.

Lynn (Puddles) explained that
her group began talking about the
Center in July. She listed the Cen-
ter’s aims as being day care.
abortion and health information.
legal information and referrals.
self defense. a feminist library.
short term lodging for women.
rap groups. and a feminist news-
paper.

One of the major concerns of
the Center is increasing inter— and
intra-city communication between
women‘s groups.

(Puddles) stated that the Cen-
ter’s planners hoped «that they
could provide a place where "all
women’s groups could get togeth-
er to find out what‘s happening in
other groups, so that we can work
together rather than against one
another.“

“Intra-city communication has
already begun,” (Puddles) stat-
ed, “Recently, members of vari-
ous women’s ‘groups from all over

the city got together for a five
hour discussion and found that
they could really work together.”

Another aim of the Women's
Center is to set up manual train-
ing workshops, These would in-
clude carpentry. auto mechanics.
and various crafts.

A number of the Centers plan-
ners are presently working on the
city‘s only feminist newspaper,
The Opening.

(Puddles) explained that the
Center is presently involved in
the fund raising stage of develop-
ment. Their major project is the
presentation of three films this
Friday. Two of the films are
about women seizing power to
form women’s centers in San
Francisco and New York. The
third film is called Make—Out.
which is, (Puddles) explained,
“about what goes through a girl's
mind in the back seat of a car, and

how she reacts to a degrading sit-
uation.”

The movie will be shown in L009
Clapp Hall at 7:30 p.m. and the
Center is asking a contribution of

$1.

Presently. the Center has no of-
fice. If the Center receives suf-
ficient funds from the movies. it
hopes to rent office space and es-
tablish ,a base for the Pittsburgh
Women’s Center. The office will
be located in the South Side be-
cause. as (Puddles) explained.
“we want to get women‘s libera-
tion away from the university and
intmthe real world.”

Women’s liberation in Pitts-
burgh has started slowly and is
characterized by women of all po-
litical levels. The 40 women of
the Pittsburgh Women‘s Center
are trying to bring it all together.

S_o’you ask what I’ve learned

 ,”'the 22 year-old inmate of
estern Penitentiary reflected.
Well, one thing prison. taught

 Wilson (pseudoname) is
pfedjshort, growing in swirls near

boxer’s. This is his V first time
m"prison—a 2-4 year sentence for
_ narcotics violation.

..‘‘Before, this,” he went on, “I
_an with the hippy set—you know,
loye, peace, and all that shit. I
thought of myself as basically a
‘good person. Like you, probably,
;_I7" thought I could never kill
anyone. But that’s all changed.
‘.‘Imagine being in an 8 x 12

ing that your wife is getting a
divorce; -There’s nothing’ anyone

Nothing.” He paused, smiled
almost unintentionally, then con-
tinned, “I could kill now if it
prfofited  . . I could easily kill‘
you and feel no remorse.” '
l»_Wilson, is enrolled in the
prison’s college classes and oc-
casionally goes out‘ to speak at
piiblico’ schools and civic meet-
ing; on the drug scene.
, ‘Look at’ me,” he said, poking
,1's"thumb into his chest. “I'm a
pfriée product of the institution

filth of this pen; Since I’ve come
here, I’ye been raped by other
inmates, voluntarily had sex

"c"o_cked his head to one slide and
tarted to laugh. "Oh man, you
Wonft know how!”

according to Warden Brierley,
“Over 80 percent of the men re-
leased from Western’Penitentiary
eventually return tofsome cor-
rectional institution)’ The sys-
tem is also expensive: to keep
one man in the prison costs, the
State about $3,500 per year.

From the dollars and cents

standpoint then, less traditional
penal methods such as the com-_
munity treatment center would

be more practical; less would
be spent on security and more,
much more, on _rehabilitation.
Also, the community type insti-

‘, tution where the offender, to a

greater or lesser degree, lives
in society, would probably be
more effective, since men would
learn to adjust not to the prison
environment but to the com-
munity outside.

Ridge Avenue
North Side.

'Bill Landers, Director of the
Pittsburgh Center,’ explained its
purpose; “The community cen-
ter is a testing grounds for men
who aren’t sure they are ready
to be re-placed in society. It

-has the double purpose, too, of

serving as society’s test upon
the man. When the staff of the
(traditional) institution has "to
offer and they feel he still needs
more direction, then they may
refer him to us.” o ‘

There‘ are 22 in-residents and
44 men on extended furlough at
the Ridge Avenue Center. an
old, Allegheny mansion.

centers _

said. "My job is to help the
residents work out their prob-
lems. There are no guards here,
and to a certain extent, the. men
rely on each other and them-
selves for discipline.”

Men living in the house have
a 10:00 curfew. When they find
a job, it is extended to 12:00,
and after 30 days, 3:00 a.m.
Living at home, with friends _or
family — extended furlough 5 is
gained through counselor recom-
mendation.

"If a man violates his cur-
few,” Marsha explained,

counselor and peer group joint-
ly. Likewise, it‘ is this group
who removes the restriction.”

A man in the Center can bor-
row up to $30 per week from
house funds. He is charged $10
weekly rent. Once the resident
finds a job and pays off his debt,
with counselor approval,’ he can
handle his own money.

“But the program is.not easy,”
Whitehead insisted. “It re-
quires a lot of work on each
man’_s part and a lot of respon-
sibility.”

The "residents meet twice
weekly in small -groups to talk
over their problems and‘ help
one another; for a few hours
Thursday evenings, the whole
house “raps”-—about restrictive
rules, an unfair counselor,
or the dismissal of a secretary.

Not every resident believes
community treatment worth-
while. One man, who -haslno
steady job and owes the Center
$300, feels that the responsibil-
ity and pressure are too great.

"Sometimes,” he said, ‘*I’d ra- --

ther be back in Rockview "(pris-
on). At least there you don’t
have to worry about money or a
job—they give you work and they
give you money.”

John Williams (pseudonamel
has lived in the residence four
months. He is enrolledin Alle-
gheny County Community Col-
lege and works part time as an
electrician." “The Center has
made things available for me,”
the 32 year-old native Pitts-
burger said. “No.matter what
you do in an institution, there’s
nothing to test it against. It’s
an abnormal situation. At least
here, I can test what I have and
can find out whether I’ll use it. ’

“Although I’m free_—” He
leaned back in the black vinyl
couch; “Although I’m free, I
know in my mind that’I’m not
really a free agent.” ‘

A man who takes-off _from
the Center and does not report
within 48 hours is charged with
prison break, which carries, at
least, an additional one» year
sentence. "They ‘have just

i enough hold on me,” Williams

mused, “to let me know that if
I screw up, I have to serve the
remainder of my time and may-
be then some.- That’s a power-
fulclub.

“No.” John Williams, a re-
peated offender of the narcotics
act, shook his head. “No, I’ll
never use heroin again. I don’t
need to now. Here they really
let a man try to make something
of himself—to change—to expose
himself to a different life style.
You know,” he said, standing,
ready to leave for work. “before,
when they said society, I didn’t
consider myself in it. They were
always talking about something
other than me—something out
there. But now I feel I’m part
of it and I think they made.it
available.’_’ . .

estimate ‘ that about 80 per-
cent of the men in Western
Penitentiary don’t need that

strict security. Pittsburgh Treat-
ment Center Director, Bill Land-
ers, says the figure is “probably
closer to 50 or 60 percent.

“But you have to understand,”
"that the men
we are dealing with—the people
in the State prison—are not usual-

ciety or have a conflict and ‘_

can’t' get it together.

“When a judge gives a guy a
5-10 year sentence, he has no
way of predicting when that
man will be rehabilitated. What
we are trying to develop is a
continuum of rehabilitation—maxi-
mum, medium, and minimum
security institutions, more in-
tense community centers, half-
way houses, and so on. ~Where
the offender is placed in this
continuum ‘will depend on the
treatment he requires. He
may then’ move frontwardv or
backward depending on his re-
sponse.” _

Perhaps the best opportunity
for far reaching penal reform
lies _, i_n the enactment of the
"good time?’ bill now in Harris-

          

 

burg. 'H.B. _ 680 would permit
prisoners sentenced to more than
two years in a state correctional
institution to take part in rehabil-

.itation programs and earn "cre-

their - eventual release date.‘ ‘The

purpose,” say_the sponsors of the V
Bill, "is to hold out some hope

of salvation to inmates who other- ‘'
wisemight give up on "efforts to
restore them to ‘constructive

program

The bill is supported by Super-
intendent Brierley of Western
Penitentiary, many prison ad-
ministrators, and most. inmates
of the Institution.

“It would remove the criteria
of time,” one man said, who is
serving a 26-50 year sentence
for armed robbery. “Now a guy
won’t have to spend his life
in here just because some crazy
judge gave him a ridiculous
sentence. He can work in the
programs, try to change and

have some hope of living out-
side the Wall.’’‘ ‘-

This reform legislation would
largely place the ‘responsibility
of determining ‘when a man
should,‘ be returned to society
upon the counselors of the in-
stitution. h

At Western Penitentiary,
there are seven counselors for
750 inmates. “How can one man
know 100 or 180 prisoners?”
Gus Mastros, supervisor of conn-
selor, answered: “It’s impos-
sible. You know that. And if
“good time’ passes, more re-
sponsibility will be placed on
our shoulders. We will have to
know 'when this man should be
released, we will have to de-
termine when that man is ok,
and’ yet, there are some men we
hardly, know. For this kind of

responsibility we -need more

competent personnel and that
means more money.” '

More money means -public
commitment. The lady in Kro-
ger’s laughed. "No son, not
money for criminals. You’re all
wrong,”, She tossed the six-for
a-dollar cans of green beens
into her cart. “We gotta quit
spending money on them and
worry more about the victims.”
She pushed down the

then turned and repeated, "the
victims, they’re the ones that
need} our help. Not the , con-
victs.” ‘ ’

I Coffee house possible
musicians ’ forum

by CINDY MORGAN
Entertainment Editor

What his campus needs is a good coffee house. where students can

obtain light conversation, coffee, and pleasant folk entertainment. ,

The Committee on the Arts (COTA) has attempted this past week-
end to establish such a coffee house in Schenley Cafeteria. and if stu-
dent response and attendance can be used as a measurement of suc-

cess, then the results can be considered overwhelming.

Calls free for limited time only A

Z2’/5,0/to/45 credit culls backfire’

by CAROLE COVAL
Assistant Opinion Editor

Making long distance telephone calls is fun. Es-
pecially when it’s somebody elses’ money you’re us-
ing. But a Bell security agent I talked with Friday
assures me that you’ll get caught sooner or later.

He showed me a computer card with a lot of
green ink and the words FRAUD plastered across
it, with the date. name. location, and time. plus the

Christmas, or when an invoice is due.

The security agent says that everything is con-
fidential. In other words, the dean or your parents

won't hear about it. I guess it's easier to settle the '

bill with him. too. unless you want to go to court and

pay $100 per call plus court fees, or sack out down.

at the jail for a few years.
The agent told me that a boy and girlfriend

“team” had been caught making calls to and from

a local icolleg_e.

Students not only run out of money for concerts and movies. but

can get tired of them after awhile. And after the movies are over at 11
o’clock, where can a student go except to the local hamburger hang-out
of his choice? -

At a coffee house, you can come in at any time you please, and nev-
er ever be late, and the atmosphere is certainly a lot nicer than can be
found in a quick-service restaurant for a few hours.

The need has been established and the standing—room only crowds
on both Friday and Saturday nights prove it.

But what of the future of the coffee house‘? From what I am told.
it looks grim.

COTA is without finances to bring in entertainment and the group
which appeared this week-end did it for free.

What happens if well-meaning groups no longer volunteer their
services? Will this mean a partial shut-down until someone steps for-
ward?

If COTA can not dig up the funds from allocations, or the Universi-
ty, or devise some means of gleaning finances in other ways, perhaps
there is still hope for its survival.

There is an abundance of struggling young campus musicians try-
ing to break in acts. And there are still others, who although they have
no desire to become professionals have enough talent that they easily
could entertain an audience for a few hours.

The coffee house, then, could become a forum for campus musi-

cians, a place to become polished, and a place to get started. Since the
campus coffee house would already be filling in an entertainment gap.
then maybe it could provide this service, too.

The coffee house proved itself a necessary part of campus social
atmosphere, and by no means should it be allowed to die. I, for one, am
looking forward to returning, and like many others. would be disap-
pointed to find the doors locked some Friday or Saturday evening.

cost of the call on it, too.

He quipped that he had also read Jerry Rubin’s
Steal This Book, and it’s helpful to “the other side”
in apprehending credit card abusers.

Pitt students are paying for their calls, wheth-
_ er before they dial or after the agent calls them.
In some cases. I‘d imagine it‘s hard on the budget.
Paying for afew calls to Mexico,
even Israel might come at an inopportune time. like

gers” of a “general frustration
with the Pitt News‘ declining abil-
ity to present responsible journal-
ism.” I

Said Lawson of the actions tak-
en bysstudents in the quad: "We
feel that we cannot rely on the
Pitt News for factual news. Also.
the Pitt News launches personal
vendettas against persons in or-
ganizations—their interpretations
are always biased."

Lawson voiced particular criti-
cism about the column on the So-
cial Commission meeting.

"It was written in the context
of a factual article when in reality
it wasn't.” '

The article on the drug arrests.
Lawson said, was "also detrimen-
tal to the situation."

The real danger in this situation is the reaction
of the administration to student offenses. Just like
dope cannot be overlooked, or “pretended not to be
there." credit card offenders will probably be next
on the list to be sitting in front of the judicial board,
unless people stop calling free.

As folk dancing expresses the

height of emotion, ballet elevates‘

it to the sublimity of_ art. How-
ever, just as the Ballet Aztlan

other language, neither could the

tion of' Swan Lake be successfully
interpreted by the language of an-

Although the camera has the ad-
vantage of providing a variety of
perspectives, it did so at the risk

of disturbing and segmenting the ~

fluid line of the ballet. Because of
cinematic ability to manipulate
time, the techniques of close-ups,
and switching from one charac-
ter to another, it interfered with
the smooth continuity.

Although these special effects

E captured elements that the human

eye is incapable of, such as juxta-
position of part and whole in rela-
tion to each other, it presented

choppy sequences that destroyed

the form of the ballet.

As far as describing dimensions,
because the peripheral, range of
the camera provides much harsh-
er clarity than the eye, it empha-
sized the occasional amputation
of limbs by the edges of the
frames. Still, it did accomplish
the task of presenting an exc"e'llent
company’s skills.

brated Soviet character dancer, is
delightfully evil as Rotbart, and
as the spirited jester, Valeri Pan-
ov, turned some incredibl_e tricks

However, although the entire

company surpasses criticism, the

film lacked the electricity of a

In conclusion, although every-

The Ike and Tina Turner Revue
will "take us higher” this Satur-
day in Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

The Revue, on the road since
1960, has only recently jetted into
the superstar bracket. The press
has newly discovered Ike and
Tina as well. Feature stories have
appeared in Life, Look and Play-
boy, and Ebony and Tan have de-
voted their covers to them.

Playing small clubs and re-
cording for even smaller record
companies, the Turners have
been working hard in recent years
developing their “gutsey, primi-

tive soul music.” ‘

Cashbox describes them as "one
of the most highly polished and

professional units ever to take the
stage.” ‘

Ike on guitar, his 10—piece band,
the three Ikettes, and Tina her-
self, play as if every performance’
is the last one.

Their first hit was in 1959, F001
in Love. Then in 1966, River Deep,
Mountain High pushed them once
again into the limelight.

Since then, they have toured,
playing-in concert and have be-
come known for their stylistic
versions of I’ve Been Loving You
too» Long, I Want to Take You
Higher and Proud Mary.

Against the pace ofits last few
years, the Revue is putting an
end to an “endless stream of one-
nighters.” They look forward to

The concert Saturday night coin-
cides with Black We'ek—one of the

main reasons the Revue was con- '

tracted, explained Social Commis-
sioner Lenny Kla vonic.

Klavonic said the receipts. for
the Blood, Sweat and Tears con-
cert may have been affected‘ by
the choice of the Fieldhouse.

Thriller ‘Sleuth’ debutsct at Nixon

by ART ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

Anthony Shaffer’s Sleuth, the
smash hit thriller which has been
selling out in New York for the
past year, will play a week’s en-
gagement at Pittsburgh’s Nixon
Theater beginning Monday, Nov.
22.

The National Company, now on
coast-to-coast tour, stars Michael
Allinson and Donal Donnelly. Mr.

I Allinson spent years playing ’Pro-

fessor Higgins in My Fair Lady;
the Irish Mr. Donnelly won enor-
mous praise for his leading role
in Philadelphia with Here I Come.

  

/« '

 

 

 

The mystery has 15 productions
all over the world, headed by the
vastly successful ones in New
York and London. Clive Barnes of
the New York‘ Times calls Sleuth
the best thriller." I have ever seen
—a super show, and one of the
most purely entertaining plays of
many seasons.

Sleuth is the recipient of the
coveted “Tony” award as the Best
Play of the 1970-71 Broadway sea-
son. \

In a hazardous. uncomfortable
and continuous rain a Pitt team
scored 337 points, and it wasn’t
good. Because it ‘was the Eastern

spelled out a poor performance

‘ Seven_years ago, Conemaugh Area High School’s
Most Outstanding Athletic enrolled at Pitt. It was
John Michelosen’s final season as the Panthers’

very discouraging to find out that all the tentatively
scheduled f rosh contests for 1965 had been cancelled.

“My whole freshman year,” Klimek remin-
isced, “was spent scrimmaging the varsity, or the
dummy opponents. I didn’t get into football too
much.” . I

I In addition to Joel’s pigskin disappointments
back then, he also encountered some academic pit-
falls.- Soon after the 1966 spring drills, he left school.

“There was a much heavier stress on old-style
academics at Pitt when I was a
freshman,” said ,Klimek. “Stu-
dents had a lot less freedom in
course selection matters. Both

  
 
 
  
   

had to face a great deal more
pressure then.

“Now there are new ideas in
 college teaching. The language
KJJMEK requirement, which sure didn’t
help me any, has been dropped. Teachers are a lot
more willing to experiment in the classroom. There
is more emphasis on learning, with less stress on
individual grades.” T

.During the almost three-year lull between
withdrawing from and re-enrolling at Pitt, Klimek

  

- , joinedthe Army and was shipped to Vietnam. Upon

ii-,._his return to the Steel City.. not withstanding three

(battle wounds and a Purple Heart citation, Klimek
_ had changed somewhat.

. “Vietnam did not change my opinion of foot-
ball,” explained Joel. “My military career justgave
me a broader outlook on the game. I also felt that I
could now handle the school work. I was more ma-
ture and knew what I really wanted.

“It’s hard to say whether I came back here to
meet a challenge or not. I wanted to play football
badly. Coach (Steve) Petro had notified me that
(the mandatory) language courses had been,abol-
ished. Finally, Pitt’s schedule was as tough as any-
body’s, and still is.”_

Klimek played behind George Medich at tight
end in Dave Hart‘s last year as coach. Nine hun-
dred and seventy-one has seen the roles reversed,
with sophomore Les Block challenging Klimek for
the starting berth. Nevertheless, there is no malice
between the two.

“Block has a lot of speed. He learns very quick-
ly. Throughout summer camp and the season, Les
has always asked me to help him out. He constantly
tries to; improve. ‘ His first game against UCLA
showed everybody that he .,co_uldfdo the. job.’ M V

I PANTHER TIGHT end Joel Klimek (88) breaks clear in

of the season in last week’s Big
Four Meet despite placing second,
had their most lack-luster run in
New York’s Van Courtland Park.

In a field of 196 runners, Mike
Schurko was Pitt‘s top man, fin-
ishing 2(9th. Freshman Bob Steele,
finishing 55th, was the second
Bannerman to cross the finish
line. Dave Szabat (74), Bob Schur-
ko (76), John Black (119), and
Dave Cheselbrough (140) rounded
out the Pitt contingent, which fin-
ished 11th in the team standings.

Assistant Coach Don Mollen
auer, who enjoyed the bright
Pittsburgh’ Monday because he
didn’t make the trip, was disap-
pointed with the IC4A results.

“We’re evaluating it now,”
Mollenauer said, "but we did very
poorly in the meet.”

Villanova copped its sixth cross
country title in the IC4A’s, but it

.‘‘I’ve never felt that Block would take my posi-
tion awayfrom me. My biggest concern was his
speed. Knowing that Les will have a great shot at
playing fulltime next year (Klimek is a senior.), I
realize that he must get game experience now.”

Relishing the body contactthat accompanies _
 his tight end slot, ‘Klimek “would like the opportun-

ity” to play professional football. Joel figures on
gaining a maximum of 10 pounds (up to 230) to play
in the NFL. He admits he will have a lot to learn, but
he refuses to worry about it now. ' 

One of the Panthers’ toughest foes invades Pitt
Stadium this Saturday. However, Joel Klimek hon-

. estly thinks the Cats can beat the Penn State Nit-

tany Lions. 7
-“I believe we have the potential to win. We’re

as good as any team we play. It all depends on how

the breaks go. If we don’t‘ fumble, we can do it.

“It’s hard to anticipate what the Penn
State defense will do. They’re quick and aggressive.
My job will be to block the defensive end and outside

‘, linebacker. ~”

Klimek states that PSU halfback Lydell Mitch-
ell is "one of the best’ in the nation.” Undoubtedly,
he will severely test the rushing defense. Yet Pitt’s
rugged, 24-year-old tight end has not given up
hope. He has fought, and triumphed over, adversity
before. Joel insists the Panthers "can put it to-
gether.” The question is, do the remaining 43 Old
Gold and,Blue participants think likewise?

Bittersweet season i

-— by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

—It takes quite a lot to be a successful soccer team, especial-A I 
.ly at Pitt. Not only must the individualson the squad be profi- ‘_ 

cient soccer players but they must also be track stars.

Jumping hurdles, overcoming a barrage of obstacles, has.._Vfl,
been a constant occupation for the booters during the ’71 cam-* 

paign.

The season hadn’t even begun but the soccermen- seemed 
‘to have been infected by that all to catchy “disease” called dis—. . -

sention. It wasn’t the normal case of dissention—players vs.

players——but the rarer malady of friction between the --pla,vers"_,.._C

and their coach, Leo Bemis.

The booters had many other problems to contend with too.  ‘A
One after another obstacles were thrown in their path, each at- . ‘

tempting to block their chances for a bid to the NCAA playoffs._

At the start of the ‘season, academic standings threatened”
_ the eligibility of Gus Theofilos. Through a misunderstanding,

Theofilos was three credits short of the-number required to par-
ticipate in a varsity sport. . g M
The Office of -Student Affairs and the Eligibility Committee

finally gave Theofilos the OK to return the soccer team success-

fully overcoming this problem. ‘ - ~» -

The squad, however, was less suc-
cessful in hanging on to a few other key
players. '

Immediately after the contest
against West Chester, early in the
campaign, fullback Jerry Kruth, who
had just recently acquired an addition-
al year of eligibility, quit the team be-
cause he was unable to obtain an ath-
letic scholarship.

The other booter to evacuate ‘was
lineman John White. Just before~Pitt
was to play one of its toughest oppon-

 

JANICE BUCCIIGROSSI '

ents of the season, West Virginia, White‘ decided to become a 

place kicker on the Panther football team.

It didn’t have anything to do with liking one sport better T

than the‘ other, White “just always wanted to play football” and
had never before been given the chance.

The booters may have lost some key players but they never '

lost the support of the student body, mainly because the" team
never really had their support to begin with; ,

True, the number of spectators at the games this year was  
much larger than in the past but even this unfortunately can’t ; 
compare to the backing given to soccer teams at-, other univer-’ , .
sities. For example, in the Pitt-Penn State contest last Saturday, - '

approximately 2,000 spectators filled Beaver Field.

Despite all these drawbacks, the soccermen pounded out a K J.
7-3-2 record by the season’s end. This record, however, wasn’t " - "

good enough to enable them to make the NCAA playoffs.

Coming so close to making the playoffs and getting nosed‘

out at the end was tough to take——it’s difficult to work hard for
something all year only to let it slip by at the very end. '

But the ’71 booters. don’t have to make any apologies for

their performance, not any more. “We had a good season—at_ A I

least a winning season,” stated Coach Bemis.

More importantly, the booters put themselves together in -

spite of all the obstacles placed in their road. They over came

all the hurdles and played as a team—something/they found hard ' 

I

to do earlier in the season.

Sure they lost games, but not because they beat themselves,   .~

but rather because they were beaten by better teams.

Seeds of dissention, loss of key players, all these things the  I I

booters had._to overcome. But something valuable was learned
the place to get ‘beat is on the field and not off. 7 

. If for-no other reason than this,’ the season was a success} :7

self week after week. year after
year. His opponents chide him for
his slowness and small size.

Despite all this. 5-9 senior quar-
terback Dave Havern ‘must have
done a lot of things right in ‘his
past four years as a Panther. At
the end of the present season. his
name will accompany eight all-
time Pitt football records—more
than any other Panther player.

His -most recent accomplish-
ment. that of the all—time total
yardage mark had’ been antici-
pated for many weeks. A fourth
quarter pass to Joel Klimek in the
Army game put Havern over the
top. .

“I knew I had a chance at it af-
ter my sophomore year,” Dave
admitted. “It’s been in the back of
my mind that I could do it.”

In Havern’s first season. he

' racked up over 1,800 yards on the

way to the 3,200 goal. Going into
this week’s Penn State game, he
has earned 3,272 yards.

Havern realizes that his critics

 

have had reason to complain
throughout his career. “There
have been a- lot of days when I
haven‘t been exactly Heisman
Trophy material. No one is hard-
er on me than myself. I‘ve been
disappointed with many out-
comes.”

Every year that Havern has
played, he has battled several
other candidates for the Pitt QB
spot. At times, he lost the start-
ing position only to enter late in
the game to save the game.

This.'year‘s UCLA contest was
a good example. Relegated to the
third string before the game,
Havern entered in the second half
to lead the squad to the upset vic-
tory. ‘

“I knew in the back of my mind
that I would get the chance. I real-
ly knew the UCLA defenses from
experience." ,

Havern feels his weekly battle
for the starting position has help-
ed him.

"I don’t like anybody saying that
someone else is better than I

when it isn't so. I know I’m ter-

rible in practice. but when the
game comes, I hate to lose.”

For Havern, this week’s Penn

stuff we have had in the past four
years. It will take a super effort-
we’ll just have to launch ourselves

the happiest.

Dave Havern’s fondest wish
right now is to beat Penn State

silence his critics if he and the
Panthers can pull it off.

’ ‘ Wednesday, November 17," 1971——THE PITT   

 Mitchell’s marks pave Away

   
  
 
 
 
 
   

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

When the 1971 grid season began, Penn State’s vet-
eran halfback Lydell Mitchell was known as "Mr. Out-
side." Now he’s known as “Mr. Everything.”

It‘s not enough that Mitchell now holds the NCAA
record for most touchdowns in one season and has tied

the mark for most touchdowns rushing,with 23, but_

Mitchell also is second behind tight end Bob Parsons in
PSU receptions this year.

“He’s had a fantastic year,” commented Lion men-
tor Joe Paterno via Bell Telephone Tuesday at the week-
ly Pitt football luncheon. “I just can‘t believe that there’s
anyone better in the country.”

Sports Information Director John Morris echoed Pa-
terno’s praise. “J oe’s said for a month now that Mitchell
is the best in the country. He hasn't seen everyone but
how could anyone be better. He does it all. He's a great
leader and a great ballplayer. He now holds 11 Penn State
records in rushing and scoring.”

‘Citing a few awesome statistics should provide the
evidence. Mitchell has rushed for a net total of 1,303 yards
this season averaging a mere 6.3 yards per carry. He has

also caught 11 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. ’

Paternoa also cited Mitchell’s blocking ability as a great
asset to the rushing an_dWp’aAss_in_g ga_rn_es.

“He can do it all—run, catch, block, and he has been
a leader,” said Paterno. “There can’t be a better all-
around back in the country.”

This barrage of praise can only lead in one direction-
the Heisman Trophy. In recent weeks there has been an
upsurge in the interest surrounding Mitchell’s Heisman
possibilities. With each ensuing week, as the yardage piles
up, the PSU veteran is being associated, more and more,
with the Pruitts, the Marinaros and the Patulskis.

.“I hope he gets strong consideration and I hope that

‘he makes his,” said Paterno about Mitchell’s chances for

the trophy. ' V

A history major who is considering law school after
graduation, Mitchell seems pleased with the attention and
the records. but appears more concerned with victimizing
opponents. '

“Records are nice, but winning is nicer,” comment-
ed Mitchell who has greatly contributed to the 14 straight
victories the Lions have strung together. In the two games
that Pitt and Penn State have played while Mitchell has

‘been at State College, the Lions have won both. If Pitt is to

turn the trend around this week-end, stopping Mitchell
will be the main order of the day.

Mitchell has rushed for over a 100 yards in seven of
the Lion’s nine games this yea_r and. a determined effort
by the Pitt defense is essen't1'alto avoid rr_iber_eight_.:_

bu when they did enter someone,

In the entire meet all that Pitt
could muster was two first places.

Annamarie Crelli copped the
100 yard breaststroke in a re-
spectable time of 1:23.41. In the 50
yard edition of the same stroke
she wasznarrowly touched out at
the wall, denying her ‘a second
first place finish. She: settled for
second. timed in 36.9 seconds,

“The times were pretty good
but I could have done better.” she
recalled. -

“The pool was a slow pool,”
Crelli explained. “They had the

gutters built flush with the deck.

arjound the pool. All the wave ac-
tion washed up on the deck and
really wasn’t absorbing the back-
wash.”

"Without the big wall facing me
it was psychologically unnerving
when I went into the turns.”

The unnerved freestyle relay
team was more than five seconds
off their time of last week in the
slow pool as they went on to win
the only other event. 200 yard
freestyle relay, in 2 :00 plus.

As with the meet against Slip-
pery Rock the team picked up
numerous third place finishes
here and there to up their score
bit by bit.

Mary Jo Richards came through

with her usual consistant per-
formance in achieving ‘a third in
diving.
, Patty Lausberg had a good time
in the 100 yard freestyle but didn’t
finish first. It was one of her best
performances, according to Grin-
dle. '

This week the team will face a

similarly tough schedule on only’

one days rest between meets.

They traveled to West Vir-
ginia and come back Thursday
night and host perennial power-L
house Clarion State ‘College’.
