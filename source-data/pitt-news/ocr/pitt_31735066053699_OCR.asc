the motion.

The plan is designed to improve Pitt’s cam-
pus and student programs to make the school
more attractive to prospective students.

Improvements to Pitt’s music and theater
facilities were not included among the priorities
in the original draft of the report by the
University Capital Planning Committee.

This report was the main focus of discussion

at yesterday’s Faculty Assembly meeting, where
Sarah Barker, associate professor of theater, and
Mary Lewis, associate professor of music, com-
plained that the University was not meeting the
needs of their departments. Barker said the
Capital Plan caters to_ the desires of the athletic
programs over the needs of the fine arts.

Daniel Barry is a busy man. He’s
a doctor, a’ pilot, a researcher, and a
professor. He recently added another
titleon to his long list of occupations:
astronaut.

Barry spoke about his recent shut-
tle mission and experiences Thursday
at Montefiore University Hospital.

On Jan. 11, 1996, Barry ascended
into space with five fellow astronauts
aboard the space shuttle Endeavor.
Their mission was to retrieve one
satellite, deploy another, and perform
experiments related to the upcoming
International Space Station. Barry
also said the mission focused on
studying the effects of space on the
human body.

The research Barry conducted is
designed to find ways to help man
adjust to life in space and bring us
closer to traveling to Mars.

“In just nine days, my body
accepted space as its natural environ-
ment,” said Barry. However, life in
space results in bodily ﬂuid shifts,
muscle atrophy, loss of balance, and
other problems upon returning to
Earth. Barry said that he could actual-
ly “feel” gravity upon returning to

‘Earth.

Panama claims military fort
in first step at U.S withdrawal

Around the World

DUBLIN, Ireland — The future of
Northern Ireland may not be a peace-
ful one, as peace talks nearly col-
lapsed Monday. This reaffirms fears
that the cease—fire may be broken by
Protestant paramilitary factions.

Loyalist prisoners said that they
no longer support the talks dueto a
lack of progress. Officials said that
their cease—fire was under strain due
to IRA bombings ‘of England.

PANAMA CITY — Yesterday, the
government of Panama officially
took over Fort Amador at the

entrance of the Panama Canal. The

207-acre former U.S. military fort

World War I and is the first of sever-
al to be turned over to the
Panamanian government.

This is‘ the first step in the U.S.
withdrawal from Panama which is
scheduled to occur over the next
three years. The Panama Canal
treaties call for the U.S. to withdraw
from its bases and give up control of
the canal by Dec. 31, 1999. The New

THE PITT News

CWO nominaes a real doll for queen

The Campus Women’s Organization
nominated a beautiful, slim blonde with
blue eyes as their candidate for homecom-
ing queen.

Her name is Barbie, and she’s made
of plastic.

In an attempt to draw attention away

. from corporeal pulchritude, the CWO

nominated the well—endowed children’s
toy to satiiize the stereotypes associated
with the race. « .
“We are not doing this to make ﬁm of
the other candidates or make them look

bad,” said Kim Graziani, co—president of
the CWO. “We just want to show that
when it comes to picking a homecoming
queen, it should be more then just a pretty
face that decides the winner.”

The CWO leaders said they wanted
the rest of the members to know this unof-
ﬁcial nomination is the leaders’ decision,
and any member who doesn’t want to be
involved doesn’t have to be.

“I believe, as women we must stop
ﬁghting among ourselves if we want to
succeed, and by picking Barbie some may

think we are going against a certain group
of women, but we are not. We just want to
make a point,” Graziani said.

Graziani said she feels that the CW 0
are letting the public know that when it
comes to voting someone for any contest
or political oﬂice, people should base their
judgments on more than just the physical
aspects of that person’s character.

“We must stop looking at a woman’s
surface if we ever want to get the respect
we deserve,” Graziani said. ,

Homecoming 

Monkey,” that “homecoming should be a
spirit thing. I go to every [football] game,

cheer the team on. I don’t think half the‘

people [campaigning] are doing it for
school, they’re doing it to get their face all
over campus.” .

If that was, in fact, the goal of some can-

achieved. In case anyone
failed to notice the candi-
dates’ faces on display in
the Towers or the
VV1l]iam Pitt Union, yes-
terday morning saw
every, parking meter on
Bigelow Boulevard plastered with a
homecoming poster. .

“It’s just a contest to see who’s the
most popular and prettiest out of them all,”
said freshman Suzarme Civotti, who did
not run for any ofﬁce yesterday.

“Who’s going to clean up all this
paper everywhere?” demanded an uniden-
tiﬁed CWO member. “I have a lot more
respect for [Faheem, “The Funky
Monkey”] out here dancing than . ,
those others who just shove paper, ‘I .
in your face.”

Ironically, the vast majority
of homecoming candidates who
print posters and ﬂyers fail to
include anything more than their name,
face, and sponsor. When all the posters
look the same, how do any of them serve
to distinguish their candidate?

Last year, Anil Mehta captured the
king’s crown as an independent candidate

by creating a series of
creative posters, portray-
ing Mehta in amusing
situations, which clearly
stood out from the mass
of other candidates’
posters.

Huff obliquely

referred to Mehta’s campaign as evidence
of homecoming’s decline. “People have
begun to make a mockery of homecom-
ing,” she said, “running with some asinine
campaign, making a complete and total
joke out of it.”
But is it fair to attack an independent can-
didate, running without the backing of a
Greek organization, because he
was able to become homecoming
king by doing a better job of what
all the candidates do — namely,
achieving name and face recogni-
tion?

If there is any travesty to be
found in Mehta’s win last year, it is in the
simple fact that it is impossible to
“make a joke out of” homecoming
when nobody can satisfactorily
explain what the purpose of the
entire process is to begin with.

“It’s like the primaries!” said
freshman Hary Suseela, watching the can-
didates stump for votes. “Why are people
campaigning like this? I’ve already seen
some mudslinging — you know, things
like ‘Funky Monkey is kinda weird.’”

Sophomore Rachel Steigerwalt was

 

 

sufficiently disenchanted by the candi-
dates to decide against voting at all. “I just
refuse. There are so many more important

things to do today than skip class and '

dance outside your car so you can get
votes,” she said, referring, of course, to
Humera Faheem, “The  Monkey.”
Freshman Okey Keke agreed. “They’re
blowing it out of proportion. This is
unnecessary! It’s just a lot of noise.”
To be sure, there are some students who
seem to appreciate the spectacle. “It’s
awesome,” said freshman Adam Getson.
“You have this big notion of what college
is like, and it’s really like that. It’s an awe-
some atmosphere. I love it.”

Perhaps the single catchiest campaign
slogan to be found this year was that of

- Ann Augustyn and Eric Barr,
candidates for the Phi Sigma Pi
coed national honor fraternity,
whose ﬂyers read, “Vote Geek
Not Gree .”

Sadly, neither candidate could
make it to the Towers to carn-
paign themselves —-_ they were busy
attending class. Lousy luck, but hey, this is
a university.

DOE trains students in energy prudrcion, use, conservation

Jaime Leach

   

The U.S. Department of Energy
is fueling an internship program
next summer to give students a
chance to spend 10 weeks doing
work alongside federal scientists.

The Department of Energy pro-
gram is managed by the Oak Ridge
Institute for Science and Education.

ORISE spokeswoman Elizabeth
Kittrell said that the purpose of the
program is to ensure the availabili-
ty of properly trained scientists.
Another purpose is to bridge the
gap between academic institutions
and the DOE. By bring-ing students

into contact with international cal-
iber scientists, the participants are
able to bring a wealth of knowledge
back to the universities.

“The program is intended to be
an exchange of information
between institutions of research,”
said Kittrell. “Students have the
opportunity to work with machin-
ery they do not get the chance to
use in the university classrooms.”

The instruction and training is
designed to provide students with a
perception of energy production,
use, conservation, and societal
implications. Participants also
receive general employee, safety,
and laboratory training.

my/,
mr7C>v,

Project work relates to stu-
dents’ individual academic majors,
career goals, and the ongoing
research and development of the
facility.

The program is currently
offered to sophomores, juniors, and
seniors majoring in engineering,
physical and life sciences, mathe-
matics, computer science, or social
sciences.

Students are selected by the
DOE facility staff on the basis of
academic record, aptitude, research
interest, and the recommendation
of instructors. Applicants must also
have the potential for graduate
study and scientific careers.

The number of applicants aver-
ages between 250 and 300, with
funding available for only 50 appli-
cants. The 1996 summer program
had 37 participants, 18 of which
were male and 19 female.
Participants came from 14 states
and 33 universities.

The DOE in recent years has
been recruiting from minority and
female groups. Kittrell said the
purpose is for that is to “increase
knowledge in the [minority] com-
munity.” The DOE encourages stu-
dents to take the information they
receive to instruct citizens about
energy and conservation in other
community programs.

Students taking part will be
reimbursed for certain travel
expenses, and stipends of $250 per
week for seniors, $225 per week for
juniors, and $200 per week for
sophomores will be paid.

Participants have the opportuni-
ty to do research around the coun-
try at facilities such as the
Atmospheric Turbulence and
Diffusion Division in Oak Ridge,
Tenn., to the Savannah River
Archaeological Research Program,
Aiken, S.C., to Triangle
University’s Nuclear Laboratory,
Durham, N.C., or the Pittsburgh

cut the budget, Pitt can do without
the arts,” said Barker.

According to Barker and
Lewis, Pitt’s arts facilities are
highly inadequate. They cited

insufficient lighting in the Studio
Theater and in a music building
which is outdated as evidence that
Pitt seems less concerned with
developing the arts than it does its
athletic programs and other facili-
ties, which were mentioned in the
Planning Committee’s report.

“I don’t think the University is
pitting arts against athletics,” said
Barker, “but that’s the way this
document makes it out to be.”

The Capital Planning
Committee did include in its cam-
pus improvement document plans
for renovating Pitt Stadium, the
possibility of,a new sports convo-
cation center, and "expanded stu-
dent and faculty athletic facilities.

However, members of ‘the
assembly’s athletic committee said
the money for all the new athletic
developments is slated to come
from state funds and gifts donated
‘by individuals. -

Because Pitt hopes to recruit
and retain~more prospective stu-
dents, Barker said the administra-
tion should consider the areas most
academically gifted students are
interested in.

“The students with the top SAT
scores all participate more in the
arts,” said Barker. “We want to
provide undergraduates with an
enrichment of the arts, and a more
rounded education.”

Lewis’ motion to have the
improvement of arts facilities
included in a revision of the capital
plan was passed, but she wondered
why it wasn’t included in the first
place.

“This is a time for strong advo-
cacy of the arts,” said Barker. “We
thought it was obvious that the arts
should be included in these plans.
Apparently, it wasn’t.”

Those are some of the problems
Barry and the rest of the crew
worked on. They performed experi-

this work, the crew also tested equip-
ment for the International Space
Station.

“We tested actual components
and tools that will be used in a space
station to see what worked best and if
it would last in the cold of space,”
said Barry. . .

The crew retrieved a Japanese
satellite and its data and then
launched another satellite to collect
more data on Earth’s atmosphere.

In between this work, the astro-

pictures of the Earth. “You see so
many different shades of blue. It’s so
much different in life than from a
picture,” he said.

Now that he has returned to solid
ground, Barry said he hopes to be
going back up. He said his education
and experience with the tools they
tested will be valuable when they
start building the space station.

“Persistence was key in getting
this chance [to explore space],” said
Barry. He was turned down from the
space program for 13 years before
finally being accepted. When he
entered the program he was part of a
class of 23 astronauts who trained for
one year before traveling into space.

1992 when he was selected to be
aboard the Endeavor mission.

Once selected, Barry trained with
three other rookies and two veterans
for another year before going up.
“You began to feel a real sense of
teamwork,” Barry said.

While in space, Barry orbited the
Earth 142 times, traveled 3.7 million
miles, logged a total of 214 hours
and 41 seconds in space, including a
six—hour and nine-minute spacewalk.

g After speaking about his experi-
ence, Barry presented to the hospital
a picture collage of the mission
signed by the Endeavor’s crew.

He said he is anxiously waiting
to see the Earth from above again.
Hopefully he’ll find some time out

from his busy schedule.

Last year, Pennsylvania came in 49th out ofthe 50 states for - ' // ' ‘xx . 0 - '1, , c- -1; , ' ll , " A ' '

est ratings for its policies regarding state teachers, according to a
report by the National Commission on Teaching and America’s
Future. 4 v .

Given the fact that Pennsylvania is the state where “memories /,5-,,,, , , r’

It is sickening to think that the laws regarding removing an

incompetent teacher take so much time and money which make it
nearly impossible to do. Apparently, Pennsylvania would rather
waste the futures of the hundreds of students who have a bad
teacher in order to protect an incompetent moron than to make new
legislation providing for the future of its young citizens.

Another sad fact of the Pemrsylvania educational system is
that it gives teachers a lifetime teaching certiﬁcate, but has no
requirements for any training to update teaching skills after one has
received the certiﬁcate. _

N o wonder Pemrsylvania’s population has been steadily get-
ting older. Allegheny County has the oldest population in the coun-
try, even older than Dade County, Fla., the “retirement capital” of
America If you want young people and families ‘to settle in this
state, you have to provide an adequate educational system. Wake
up, Pemrsylvania; people migrate to where the grass is greener. ‘

Once you fall behind in education, the rest is a downhill slide.
Education is the cornerstone of American society, and we are raised
with the edict to work with our heads, not our hands.
Pennsylvanians are being put at a disadvantage in the race towards
the American dream.

Perhaps the only solution to this problem is for the federal gov-
emment to create a national educational standard. If a state can’t
meet certain requirements in the quality of education that it pro-
vides, cut the purse strings and let them fend for themselves.
Maybe this will get slackers like Pennsylvania to clean up their act.

What does the fut

Whenever I listen to a debate
between some of my fellow col-
lege students, I am always struck
by the passion with which my
peers debate social issues, and the
fact that economic issues like enti-
tlement reform are more likely to
elicit yawns than anything else.
Their total lack of interest bothers
me. In the not-so—distant future, the
American people will have to
make some difficult choices which
will affect the future of the United
States , and I fear they might not be
adequately informed.

Comedian Al Franken poked
fun at Gen Xers in his hysterical
book “Rush Limbaugh Is A Big fat
Idiot,” writing: “[Generation Xers]
are poorly educated, Nintendo-
addicted children of divorce, inter-
mingled with an occasional crack
baby.” When I read that particular
passage, I was struck by how much
truth there was in Franken’s sarcas-
tic prose. I don’t want to buy into
stereotypes about my generation
being a bunch of hedonistic, pop-
culturaholic, MI'V—watching slack-
ers, yet I must admit that my peers
show little interest in educating
themselves on the issues.

So what are the facts? Are the
Social Security and Medicare pro-
grams in such a honible crisis that,
if not solved tomorrow, the utter
destruction of the United States
will be inevitable? Certainly not,
but storm clouds are beginning to
gather, and it is preferable to solve
this problem sooner rather than
later.

Social Security is‘ an unfrmd—

ed, pay—as—you-go program. You
pay your money to support retirees,
and after you retire, you will be
supported by those younger than
you. Social Security has always
depended ‘on the number of work-
ers growing as fast as the number
of retirees, but that has not hap-
pened. In the years between 2010
and 2020, the U.S. population as a
whole is expected to grow at about
two percent, while the growth in
the retired population is expected to

A few weeks ago, I endorsed
President Clinton for re—election,
and I plan to vote for him on
November 5. My biggest com-
plaint about the Clinton administra-
tion is that the president has done
little in his ﬁrst tenn to correct the
growing problems with entitle-
ments. Before my Republican
friends jump on this and exclaim,
“Ha! It’s the Democrats’ fault!”, I
would like to say that this unwill-
ingness to reform entitlements is
bipartisan. Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich declared that politi-
cians don’t have the “moral author-
ity” to deal with entitlements,
which is a cute way of saying that
the Republican party has too little
conﬁdence in the American people
to listen intelligently to proposals to
mend these programs, so why even

ure hold for us?

try? \V1th all due respect to the
speaker, I have conﬁdence in the

ability of the American people not

to fall for doomsday rhetoric.

In 1994 Senator Robert
Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator
John Danforth of Missouri released
the report of their bipartisan com-
mission on entitlement reform.
They proposed intelligent ideas
like means-testing Medicare and
moving Social Security from its
current form to a mandatory pay-
roll savings program similar to
those being used in developing
countries like Chile, where people
can pay money into the program
and get out exactly what they paid

in. Unfortunately their ideas were '

met with virtually no interest.
Why? In the past four years, refonn
has been held up by an AARP-
contmlled Democratic Congress
and a Republican Congress that
interpreted their slim margin of vic-
tory in 1994 (nation-wide, the
Republicans won‘ a razor-thin 51
percent of the vote) as a mandate to
launch a long dreamed of assault
on “liberal” economic programs.

Is there any hope for change?
Hopefully, the climate will be right
in 1997 for Democrats and
Republicans to work on putting
some of Senators Kerrey and
Danforth’s proposals into motion.
Senator Keney is-one of the few
politicians in Washington today
with the courage to talk about enti-
tlements. I hope that he will take an
active role in the 105th Congress. I
also hope President Clinton will
address entitlements in his second
term. "

THE PITT NEWS

 

Are alaoriionsmurcler or medical?
A crime against humanity

 

It seems that these pages have
been devoting a lot of attention to the
abortion issue lately, and it is now my
turn to add some sanity to the debate. I
am now ready to defend my pro—life
position. I would first like to describe
the partia1—birth abortion procedure
which has been such a key issue lately,
and then I will ask where the “morali-
ty line” should be drawn.

As you may already know, the
partial—birth procedure is conducted on
babies in the second and third
trimesters. The process begins with the
doctor inserting forceps into the
woman and grabbing the baby’s legs.
The legs are pulled out until the whole,
still-living ‘ baby is outside of the
womb, with the exception of its head.
If the body were pulled out another
three or four inches, it would be pro-
tected as a human being under federal
law. The rest of the process is better
described by Brenda Pratt Shafer, a

nurse who assisted with this procedure «-

and testified about it before Congress
I had the good fortune of attendin

Convention in Allentown this week
end and hearing Ms. Shafer speak. He
testimony was as follows: “The baby’

' body was moving — his little ﬁngersg

clasping together. The doctor took a
pair of scissors and inserted them into
the back of the baby’s head, and the
baby’s arms jerked out in a ﬂinch, a
startled reaction, as a baby does when
he thinks that he might fall. Then, the
doctor opened the scissors up  and
sucked the baby’s brains out. I am still
haunted by the face of that little boy. It
was the most perfect, angelic face I
have ever seen.” .

Now, I would like to ask the ques-
tion, “Is this a question of morality, or
a question of right and wrong?”
According to some, abortion is a
moral issue, and the government has
no right to impose moral guidelines.
As far as I am concerned, the proce-
dure I have just described is no more
or less of a moral issue than rape, lar-
ceny, or burglary. Our government
was created to protect lives of its citi-
zens, and abortion certainly falls under
this category.

Even more disturbing is the asser-
tion that “The only right the govem—
ment has is the right to keep an order-
ly, coherent society. If society is in
danger of destroying itself by allowing
a specific legality, legislators then, and

only then, have the right to prohibit
such an action.” But if this is true, then
the government could allow doctors to
execute one year-old babies while still
keeping , an orderly society.
Furthermore, if government were per-
mitted to kill its weakest and most
defenseless members, it could, theo-
retically, be even more orderly and
productive. Doesn’t this thought
sound eerily close to Nazi Gennany,
an insult that liberals often try to hurl
at pro—life conservatives? Where are
we going to draw the line as to what
we can and cannot tolerate? W """ "

Finally, abortion defenders claim"

to support freedom and their “right to
privacy.” However, none of our rights
mean anything without the right to
live. Perhaps that is why our Founding

Fathers wrote that humans have the

been “endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted.” What if
they could hear abortion supporters
now, who claim that this is simply an
issue of personal morality?

Matt Mills wishes more people had the
spine to identify the difference
between right and wrong.

A valued medical procedure

 

The anti—abortion mob is having a
ﬁeld day lately with all this so-called
“partial birth abortion” fuss. As usual,
the substitution of gratuitously grue-
some descriptions in lieu of cogent
argument is pompously presented as a
“sane” viewpoint in order to justify the
outlawing of a legal medical procedure.

And all this effort for 500 dilation and

they can combine them with shopping

The pro—choice movement is ‘not
saying that abortion is the greatest
thing, and everyone should rush out
and have one just for the fun of it. It’s
not even saying you must have an abor-
tion even if your fetus has severe genet-
ic defects, such as no brain or a brain
outside of the body. That is for you and
your physician to decide.

So the pro—choice movement just
carmot really understand the inordinate
interest in this subject, which by normal
logic is -a private matter between a
woman and her doctor, and further-
more, a private matter affecting less
than one percent of the population. It
seems paradoxical that in a country
which endorses the ownership of guns
and the implementation of death sen-
tences, the cellular stinings of life in
the uterus has become the topic of such
 crutiny.

Pitt football fans can’t catch a

break. V

First, the Panthers forget where
the end zone is. Then, the coach says
the team is worse than last year’s 2-9
disappointment.

Unless you happen to be a mem-
ber of the Nate Cochran Fan Club,
sports life just hasn’t been fair recent-
ly.

Now, it gets worse. And this time,
Pitt isn’t even on the field.

This Saturday, two hours after the
Pitt-Temple Battle of the

and Penn State will clash for sole pos-
session of college football suprema-
cy. Well, outside of Florida, anyway.

A Hence, the problem: Who do you,
as a loyal Pitt student and Panther
fan, want to win this football game?

On one hand, you have a Buckeye
team that gave Pitt its worst thrashing
in school history — worse than any-
thing Penn State ever dreamed about
doing to this program. The 72-0 dis-
mantling on national television may
be the low-point of Panther football.
Of course, this season’s not over yet.

Twelve days ago, Pitt suffered the
unending embarrassment of letting a
running back named Pepe score three
touchdowns. Orlando Pace pushed
around the Panther defense like a
junior high bully. The Buckeye punt

return unit spotted us three guys and .

still led David Boston into the end
zone untouched.

T hat’s enough to make Pitt fans
mad for a long time. In fact, for the

will cheer anybody who can exact
some measure of revenge on the

Almost anybody.

school to college for Cress.

“You don’t have to main-
tain such a high level through-
out the whole practice in high
school as you do here,” Cress
said.

Cress is one of a wave of
Pitt freshmen from the
Midwest. She comes from
Prairie Central High School in
Fairbury, lll., where she was a
third-tearn All-American in
volleyball her senior year. She
also played softball and basket-
ball in high school. Despite her
success there, she felt it was
time to move on.

Cress knew that she want-
ed to get away from home,
which was one of the attrac-
tions of Pitt. Unlike a lot of
freshmen who come so far,
she’s still glad to be away.

“Sometimes I miss having
my family and friends right
there,” Cress said. Then she
laughed and added,
“Sometimes it’s better just to
be gone. It’s a learning experi-
ence.”

Cress’ two sisters were
responsible for introducing her
to volleyball. She started play-
ing on her own when she was
in /seventh grade.

“I just watched them all
the time and tried to ﬁgure it
out for myself and then kept
doing it,” Cress said;

She has continued to play
and do well. Cress was brought
in primarily to be a passer, but
she has added several dimen-
sions to her game. She has han-
dled her role nicely. Cress has
played in all of the Lady
Panthers’ matches so far this
season and is currently second
on the team in assists with 25.
She also has respectable num-
bers in such diverse categories
‘as kills, with 79, and service
aces, in which she leads the
team with 11. _

Besides Pitt, Cress was
also recruited by the University
of South Florida and Big East
rival Connecticut. It was a
combination of factors that
swayed her towards Pitt.

“I’m from a small town in
Illinois, and the big city attract-
ed me,” Cress said. “As far as
the team goes, I like their tradi-
tion of winning. They win the
Big East every year. And the
girls were all really nice when I
came out here. In comparison
to the other colleges, it was the
best.” .

Pitt doesn’t actually win
the Big East every year, but to
someone from a relatively tra-
dition-poor high school, 10
championships in 14 years
would seem close enough.

The NHL’s Central Division has been
dominated by the Detroit Red Wings and
Chicago Blackhawks, only to watch them
fade away oorne playoff time. -St. Louis
Blues’ Coach/GM Mike Keenan adds play-
ers to his roster every year in anticipation of
a Stanley Cup run, often resulting in ﬁrst or
second round exits come the postseason.

Here are my picks for the Central:

1. Detroit Red Wings "(last season: 62-13-
7, 180

Detroit remains the best team in the
league that still hasn’t won the Stanley Cup.
With the talent and coaching the Red Wings
possess, it’s hard to believe the Red Wings
haven’t won a championship in 41 years.

This is a squad loaded with all-stars
including Sergei Federov, Steve Yzerman,
Vyachaslev Kozlov, Greg Johnson, and

Keith Primeau.

Detroit’s defense is exceptional as well.
Veterans Paul Coffey (35) and Viacheslev
Fetisov (38), who haven’t lost a step, com-
bine forces with rising stars Niklas Lidstrom
and Vladimir Konstantinov. Lidstrom put up
career numbers last season with 50 assists
and 67 points. The 29-year-old Konstantinov
led the NHL last year with a plus-minus rat-
ing of 60.

Additionally, Detroit boasts the league’s
most solid goaltending in Chris Osgood and
veteran Mike Vernon. Osgood led them in
‘95-’96 with 39 wins and a 2.17 goals-

ecl Wings still 1 the

with the Wings last season.

2. Phoenix Coyotes (36-40-6, 5th)

Is it just me or does the team formerly
known as the Winnipeg lets look so much
better on United States soil?

Maybe it’s the fact that the Coyotes used
their olfseason time wisely and acquired
some scoring up front. Add veteran Mike
Gartner, Jeremy Roenick, Cliff Ronning and
Craig J armey to a solid list of scorers includ-
ing Keith Tkachuk and Igor Korolev and

Phoenix boasts a defensive grouping

ing department. Mats Sundin led last year’s

5. St. Louis Blues (32-34-16, 4th)

“The Czar” Mike Keenan returns for
another long season with the 1996-97 St.
Louis Blues. The only question for this
year’s campaign is how many players will
turn on the Blues’ general manager and head
coach. ‘

Keenan signed seven players over the
surrirner, including 29-year-old powerhouse
Joe Murphy. Murphy stats are a bit lower
than many predicted (22 goals and 29 assists
last season), but at 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds,
the right winger can throw his weight around
with the best of them.

Winger Brett Hull led St. Louis last year
with 43 goals, and played sensational last
month for Team USA with in the World Cup.
6. Dallas Stars (26-42-14, 6th)

While GM Bob Gainey went out and
made several improvements, the future does
not look bright this season for the Dallas
Stars.

Gainey made some major changes dur-
ing the oﬂ°season, acquiring pointrnan Sergei
Zubov and veteran forwards Pat Verbeek,
and Dave Reid. With the exception of
Zubov, none of these acquisitions are under

Rugby beats Rock 18-0 at home '

The Pitt rugby club won its first
match this season 18-0 at home against
Slippery Rock. The win raises Pitt’s sea-
son record to 1-2. .

The weather didn’t cooperate last
Saturday, but forward Jeff Derda didn’t
let the sloppy conditions hamper his
play. Derda led the team with three try-
scores, accounting for nine points. On
top of that, he scored on a penalty kick.

Derda’s first try came off a back—line
play that was stopped at the five meter
mark. Derda picked up the ball and dove
over the goal line.

“All our forwards played well,” said
Sean Tonkin, the team captain. “Jeff
Derda had an outstanding day.” .

Club President Rob Mailliard want-
ed to credit Tom Woods, Brad Wuerstle,
Sean Shehee, Dave Misiolek, and
Brendan Cumrnins for their offensive
play, but thought the score could have
been worse. '

“If the weather wouldn’t have been

L£.r$LV. as " ‘.z€‘<€35“,.;»“ ‘»‘.r-i.»-J‘

so bad,” Mailliard said, “we would have
beat them by more than that.”

Although the rugby club has a losing
record, their record may change shortly
without having to play. .

“One loss might be turned over,”
Tonkin said. “Under union ‘rules, you’re
only allowed two subs in a game. _When
we played Penn State, they had about
nine substitutions in the first half.”

Mailliard said that besides the sub-
stitution infractions, Penn State also
failed to supply a union official for the
game, yet another infraction of the rules.

If the decision is reversed, Pitt rugby
will have a win over the second-ranked
team in the country in those Nittany

Lions. This Saturday, the boys travel .

down Interstate 95 to take on the West
Virginia Mountaineers.

“It’s become a good rivalry between
us and West Virginia,” Mailliard said.
“The games are usually decided in the
last 10 minutes.”

high school who’s .ever played club
ball,” Cress said. “We were never very
good. Nobody really wanted to dedicate
their time to the sport and to being the
best that they coul .” _ I

If anyone knows‘ about dedication,
Cress is the one. It takes a lot of work to
move up from high school volleyball to
college.

“It’s a lot more competitive.
Everyone plays at a real high level. You
can’t ever get that in high school,” Cress
said. “Deﬁnitely the amount of time you
have to put into it is dilferent. I mean,
you practice every day in high school,
but it’s not as hard as this.

“Right now, I don’t really have very
much spare time. There’s not really
much besides volleyball. I eat, sleep,
and breathe it,” Cress said. “I don’t have
many friends here besides the volleyball
team yet, but I’m getting there.”

At least for now, Cress is majoring
in volleyball. As for an academic major,
the Pitt media guide says she’s pre-law,
but Cress isn’t so sure. When asked
about her major, she just laughed.

“Not a clue. I’m kind of ﬂoating
around right now,” Cress said.

One thing she knows is ﬂiat even
after college, she would like to keep
playing volleyball.

' “If mybody holds up, that would be
nice. I don’t know about how competi-
tive I would like to be, but deﬁnitely, I
would like to play,” Cress said.

Rock on each other.

And, by 3:30, th§re’s a decent 2

chance that the only people left in

Pitt Stadium will be a couple of »

alumni well-wishers, the band, and a
few hapless freshman pledges who
got stuck holding the big wooden
fraternity sign for the whole game.
Oh, and the reporters, who will be
watching the press box monitors for
the PSU—OSU kickoff.

The rest of Pitt’s faithful will be
watching the Big 10 battle from their
location of choice, drinking the bev-

erage of their choice and rooting for .

the team of their choice.

And, they’ll choose Ohio State.
It’s in every Panther fan’s blood.

One nationally-broadcast humil-
iation doesn’t equal years and years
of intrastate animosity. Pitt fans will
side with the Buckeyes, cheer for
Pepe and Pace, and pray that OSU
can return a kick with only three
guys and the mascot blocking for
Boston. .

In other words, they’ll be living
vicariously through a team that beat

‘Pitt 72-0. And on homecoming, no

less. That says something about the
state of this team.

As does the growing support for
the Nate Cochran Fan Club.

Dear University Community, '

This weekend, PITT will be honoring the National
Championship team of 19-76. As a member of that team, it’s hard
to believe that 20 years have gone by.

I remember being 1-10 in my freshman year  There were only
10 showers, 15 bars of soap, and never enough clean towels to go
around. Even the equipment and facilities were from the Jock
Sutherland era. PITT was at an all-time low!

With the help of new coaches, fresh talent, and improved
facilities, our team went from 1-1 to 12-0 in five years time.
Red-shirted in my sophomore year, I had the luxury of being a
part of theNationalChampionship Team. Beating Notre Dame at
the Golden Dome and pounding Penn,State on Thanksgiving day '
—— the memories don’t get any better than this! Thank you PITT
for the quality education and the great times remembered.

The PITT spirit is still alive! I’ve gone from being #1 in ‘76 as
a player to being #1 in ‘96 as the top manufacturer of licensed
PITT products in the country. There are 329 licensed

;, . .:= ;i_4s:»T.=r::s.-

manufacturers of PITT products and the Pittsburgh Stop (outside
vendor) produces more products than any other. This enables you
to buy quality products at low, low prices, 6 days a week. For the
past 8 years —— rain or shine — we have been happy to provide
the University Community with a large selection of PITT
merchandise. .

I would like to thank the PITT administration, student body,
and all PITT supporters for making the Pittsburgh Stop (outside
vendor) the #1 manufacturer of PITT Products in the United
States.

Thanks,
