University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center Health System announced Tuesday
plans for a new athletic complex on
Pittsburgh’s South Side that would house its
Center for Sports Medicine and provide
brand new practice facilities for the Panther
football team and the Steelers.

The proposed facility wo11ld cover 20 to
25 acres of land fonnerly occupied by the
LTV South Side steel mill along East Carson
Street and cost $25-$30 million. It would
provide three outdoor practice ﬁelds and a
100,000-square foot indoor ﬁeld.

The facility is still in the planning
stages, and UPMC has yet to iron out agree-
ments with the Steelers and the city, accord-
ing to UPMC Spokeswoman J ane Duﬂield.
But she said the health system is excited
about the prospect of the facility.

“We envision this state—of-the—art com-
plex and tremendous resources for the com-

Pittstudents plan ways to raise money for hurricane victims

Erin Lindeman
Senior Staff Writer

Nearly 75 members of the Pittsburgh
community attended_ a meeting Tuesday
evening to organize fund—raising efforts to
help victims of Hurricane Mitch in numer-

ous Central American countries.

The Hurricane Mitch Emergency
Relief Committee was formed by a group
of Pitt graduate students and members of
the Latin American Culture Union.

According to Harold Chacron, Pitt
graduate student and chief organizer of the

JEN KOWAL/STAF HPER

Pitt students discuss plans to raise funds for the nations of Honduras,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, which were ravaged by

Hurricane Mitch last month.

relief committee, the group wants to inform
all people at Pitt about the victims of the
hurricane.

The money raised by the Hurricane
Mitch Relief Committee will be given to
two organizations, Building New Hope
and the American Red Cross. ’

Barbara Wein, of Building New Hope,
a locally based volunteer organization,
spoke at the meeting.

“The biggest concern is that the aid is
not being distributed evenly,” she said.
“People are being [asked] about their polit-
ical afﬁliations ﬁrst.” ’

Wein said that the organization has
already sent thousands of dollars in direct
assistance to Nicaragua.

Before the hurricane arrived,
Nicaragua experienced a series of 317
small earthquakes and massive amounts of
rainfall. In addition, the country recently
suffered through civil wars.

Hurricane Mitch began in the
Caribbean and hit Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Honduras again before continuing
towards El Salvador and Guatemala.

These four countries have been deter-
mined as the worst—hit in Central America.

Wein said that the U. S. Military Base
in Honduras is now being used to help

administer relief to needy citizens.
Jerry Cozewith, a representative of the

I Intemational Red Cross, also spoke at the

meeting to encourage help from the com-
munity.

“We are appealing for cash only,”
Cozewith said. “The money will be held at
the Geneva ofﬁce of the Red Cross and dis-
tributed when they know it is possible for
supplies to be bought.”

He added that it helps the stricken
nations’ economies to rebound if supplies
are purchased from merchants who are still
in business after the hurricane.

Cozewith also said that all bridges,
roads and infrastructures in Honduras and
Nicaragua have been destroyed.

The Red Cross is hoping to raise $7
million in relief aid. .

The Hurricane Mitch Emergency
Relief Committee has organized a ﬁesta to
be held Dec. 7 at Rosebud in the Strip
District. Three or four Latin American
bands, as well as several other local bands,
have agreed to participate. All proceeds
from the event will be given to the ﬁmd.

On Nov. 18, Building New Hope will
have a table set up at Club Havana, a Latin

Allegheny County Commissioner Mike Dawida tells Pitt students, faculty
and staff about his recent trip to, Poland. He hopes to get Pittsburgh area
businesses to invest in the soon-to-be thriving Polish economy.

Commissioner: Poland
about to thrive

Lisa Grzyboski

Staff Writer

It wasn’t so long ago that Polish sol-
diers on horseback fought against German
bomber planes as Hitler’s aviators swept
down on Poland’s plains to begin World
War II.

Almost 60 years later, Poland remains a
nation which lags far behind the technolog-
ical innovations of the day. However, some
feel it is a nation on the cusp of breaking the
barriers to become the international mar-
ket’s next bigthing.

Allegheny County Commissioner
Mike Dawida is one of them.

“Poland has now entered into a differ-
ent era, and from a capitalistic viewpoint, it
is the best place to invest, and it is the
(Eastern European) country presenting the
most business opporttmities,” Dawida said
to a small group of about 20 people who
gathered Tuesday in Forbes Quad.

Dawida visited Pitt for a round-table
discussion about the trip to Poland that he
took with area business leaders to explore
economic opportunities between the
Eastern European nation and the Pittsburgh

region. In an effort to help Pittsburgh tap"

Poland’s business potential, Dawida secured
a $50,000 state grant to fund a county trade
oﬂice in Warsaw for one year. Allegheny
County is the only county with a trade oﬂioe
in Poland’s capital city, Dawida said.
“When I ﬁrst visited Poland in 1989, I
found a country that was profoundly and
deeply depressed,” Dawida said. “Polish
people said that they knew I was American

because of the way I walked into a room —
with my head up. Because of being under a
Soviet Communist regime for so long,
Polish people walked into a room with their
heads down. That is not the case anymore.”

Instead, Dawida said Poland, a country
that for years was restricted fromitrading
with nations outside the Iron Curtain, is
quickly becoming one of the rising eco-
nomic stars as business leaders invest in
every type of industry.

“Poland has received $30 billion in for-
eign direct investment from companies all
over the world, not just companies in the
United States,” said Bob Donnorummo,
associate director of Pitt’s Center for
Russian and East European Studies.

He said the strong investment interest
in Poland lies in its 400 million consumers
and their buying potential. It also doesn’t
hurt that labor costs are low in Poland, mak-
ing it cheaper for multinational companies
to do business there than in many, other
European countries, Donnorummo said.

The indications are that Poland’s econ-
omy is ripe for the picking, Donnommmo

said. From 1989 to 1992, Poland went‘

through a deep depression two times the
size of the Great Depression in the United‘
States. However, beginning in 1993, the
country emerged from the rubble to experi-
ence a 5-percent growth in its gross domes-
tic product — a sizeable increase, said

Donnorummo, It has continued to grow '

throughout the ‘90s and shows no signs of
stopping.

munity,” said John Paul, executive vice pres-
ident and Chief Operating Oﬂicer of
UPMC. “The development of such a com-
plex was ﬁrst conceptualized by UMPC staif
who had been exploring the expansion of the
sports medicine program”

Eric Cartwright, vice president of devel-
opment for Oxford Development Company,
and Jeffrey Slusarick, vice president of
sports architecture at L.D. Astorino &
Associates, Ltd., presented UPMC’s plan to
the South Side Plamring Forum Tuesday
night.

UPMC contracted LSA and Oxford
Development Company to design and build
the facility, respectively.

Cartwright and Slusarick displayed
drawings and overhead layouts of the pro-
posed site, and answered questions from
members of the forum.

Cartwright said Pittsburgh’s Urban
Redevelopment Authority will review
UPMC’s proposal for 90 days to determine
to what extent they will back the project.

For now, the top priority will be to forge
an agreement with UPMC and the Steelers,
Dufﬁeld said.

Although nothing is ﬁnal, UPMC antic-
ipates the Steelers’ involvement in the facili-
ty, Duﬂield said.

That should not be a problem according
to Steeler Spokesman Ron Wahl, who said
the team is “deﬁnitely interested” in sharing
the complex with Pitt.

“It’s something we’re excited about and
we think it has a lot of potential,” he said.

FROM PAGE 1

The Steelers will lose their present prac-
tice facility on the North Side when con-
struction begins on their new stadium in
1999, so ﬁnding a new place to practice is a
top priority.

Dufﬁeld said UPMC’s interest in build-
ing the facility is born out of the need for
additional space for the Center for Sports
medicine.

Dr. Freddie Fu, chairman of UPMC’s
Department of Orthopedic Surgery, would
be able to move his world-renowned prac-
tice to the new complex, Duflield said.

The center’s present facility, at the cor-
ner of Craig Street and Baum Boulevard in
North Oakland, is overcrowded and in need
of more space.

Moving the sports medicine program to
the South Side would also free up the space
at the existing center for other programs or
ofﬁces, she said

The sports medicine facility is the sec-
ond commitment UPMC has made to the
former LTV site. Its also proposing an oﬂice
building adjacent to the sports complex. The
city will sell the rest of the 123-acre space to
businesses and restaurants.

Duﬂield said UPMC is dedicated to the
communities they move into and will make
it a priority to have a good relationship with
the residents in the area of the facility.

She said sports medicine care at the
complex would be available to everyone but
that it was too early to determine public
availability of the practice facilities.

“We have to work with various com-
munity groups and get their input,” Duﬂield
said

DAWIDA

FROM PAGE 2

Poland also is in a hurry to build new
highways, install pollution controls,
upgrade computer systems and improve
health care delivery.

Health care is one area about which
Irene Lanza knows quite a bit. The CO-
owner of Lanza Respiratory Services,
which sells medical equipment all over
Western Pennsylvania, travelled with
Dawida and other business leaders to
Poland over the summer.

“In order to know if our business
would ﬁt into the Polish economy, we had
to know what kind of medical structure they
had over there,” said Larrza, who was born
in Poland.

The obsolete and makeshift medical
equipment appalled but didn’t surprise her.
She said Poland has a tough road ahead, at
least when it comes to health care.

‘‘(Poland) has high unemployment.
Under Communist rule everybody had a
job, but now many don’t,” Larrza said.
“Right now, socialized medicine pays for
them. Who is going to pay for them when
the country privatizes health insurance?”

Aside from these concerns, Lanza said
she believes it’s in the best interest of
Allegheny County to invest in Poland while
the economy is in its birth stages.

“Trrne is of the essence, and you don’t
want to get lost in the shuﬁfle,” she said.

Not that Pitt football needs

the South Side for both the

The use of the same practice
facility could also help cement
relations between the Steelers
and the Panthers. Could this be a
sign of things to come?

Though this complex is a
great addition, it only adds to the
rumor that the Panthers could be
playing football in the new
Steelers stadium on the North
Side. Student Government Board
President Alyson Wallach plans
to distribute ﬂiers this Saturday
at the Pitt-Boston College game
to let students ‘know about the
possible move and to try to stir
up a protest against the idea.
After all, can Pitt Pride still exist
when students have to travel to
the North Side to watch Pitt play
home games?

If the rumor is true, Pitt stadi-
um will be demolished. The
plans to have the convocation
center disconnected from the sta-
dium are already set in stone, so
the land is available. And UPMC
does have a penchant for expand-
ing these days.

Whether the rumors of .the

Panhandling is a demeaning way of life

A few days ago, I found myself involved in
a discussion about Tony Oliva’s Nov. 2 Pitt
News column, “Can your spare some sense?”
The person with whom I was having this discus-
sion took issue with a statement made in the arti-
cle that working at McDonald’s is better than liv-
ing as a transient off of the kindness of others (a
condition more commonly lmown as “being a
burn” or “panhandling”). .

Working at McDonald’s is a better means '

of subsistence than panhandling. Sure,‘ it is the
epitome of the demeaning job. The workplace is
a hot, greasy environment full of irate customers
who are sure that you are moving as slowly as
possible just to spite them. You go home
smelling like fry fat and “special sauce,” and the

uniforms are really ugly. But so what? The truth.

is that unless you just happen to be the CEO» of
your own Fortune 500 company, any job is
bound to be demeaning to some- extent There
will always be someone higher up
than you who will want your head on
.a platter if you screw up. Does that
mean we shouldall pick up stakes
and ﬁnd our own special slab of‘con- '
crete down on Forbes Avenue just because “the
Man” has us down? . ' _

No matter how demoralizing your job is, all
of the unpleasantness (or at least enough of it so
that you can function) fades away when the pay-
check is in your hands. It is something y6'ri””vé'
earned, and there is a certain self-respectthat
comes with that knowledge. This feeling doesn’t
come when things are just handed to you.
Having’ to work for money is a dehumanizing
experience. You do so with the explicit knowl-
edge that you amount to nothing more than a
numbert_hatcanbeterminated(or,touseﬂre
more pleasant and ever-so-popular euphemism,
“downsized”) and replaced with nothing more
thanasignature onaslip ofpaper. »

But the existence that is truly dehumanizing
is one based on dependence. This dependence
takes many fonrrs: dependence on others, depen-
dence on the government, dependence on drugs
& alcohol, etc. The entire support group/self-
help industry and its many progeny are based on
the innate desire of people to be completely inde-

  
  

MARK
CAMPBELL the cycle. Ifthere are,  fact," people

pendent. We live in a country whose very exis-
tence is based on this same principle. Why do we
fail to recognize that panhandling is a form of
dependence and that by “being compassionate,”
we are actually encouraging this dependence?
Every time you give a panhandler a dollar
for a “cup of coffee” or a “bite to eat” (or to that
one guy who is actually honest and walks around
Oakland saying, “I just wanna get drunk Could
you spare a dollar?”), you are contributing to this
highly destructive cycle. You are, in effect,

telling them that it is OK to be dependent on oth- _

ers because there are people like you out there
who are willing to help them out In a way, you
are enslaving them. -

Panhandling is quite possibly the most
undigniﬁed way of life known to man. Hurrran
dignity is sacriﬁced every time a bum asks a
stranger for a handout And giving the person
that handout only makes this indignity worse. It
is somewhat like a drug, addiction in
that every time you give a little, it
makes it that much harder to break

Willing to give, why get a job?
Let me explain that this is not applicable to

all forms of charity but only panhandling. There

will always be‘ unemployment; capitalism
wouldn’t ftmctionf without it There will always
be mothers who, despite their efforts, still can’t

W" fri§r‘ria“§é"‘tb'"féé'Ei’tl'iéif cer-

tainly always be the ubiquitous “unforeseen cir-
cumstances.” Soja little help for those who have
had some setbacks in life is more than appropri-
ate. Panhandling, however, is not a viable option.
' ' So this, in a nutshell, is why I won’t give my
spare change to that guy who stands outside the
7-Eleven waiting for me to come out. I respect
his right to stand out there in lieu of getting a job,
but I also have the right to refuse to feed into his
demoralization. Sure, working for a living is not
pleasant It is demeaning to the human spirit But
it is far more degrading to depend solely on the
kindness of strangers. A

Mark Campbell doesn’t understand why people
have to panhandle when they can sell their bod-
ies to science.  Plasma anyone? -

 

  

S East
Football: Better
than you think

If there is one thing you can’t say
about Big East football, it’s that it’s bor-
ing. In fact, the Big East provides some
of the most exciting college football
these days, and I’ll tell you why: parity.

Webster’s New World College
Dictionary deﬁnes “parity” as “the state
or condition of being the same in power,
value, rank, etc.; equality.” _In other
words, the Big East football conference.
Parity equals excitement in my.mind.

Sure, it’s disappointing when Pitt
loses to the likes of Temple and Rutgers,

but it’s a thrill for those teams’ fans, just ‘

like it was for Pitt fans last year when the
Panthers beat Miami, Virginia Tech and
West Virginia. ’

In any given week, an upset can
occur in the Big East football conference.
That can’t be said about the majority of
the so-called power conferences in
Division I football.

For instance, the Florida State
Seminoles are in their seventh season in
the ACC, a conference they have won
every season in their first six years, and
they are only one victory away from win-
ning it for the seventh time in seven
years. Boring! .

They only have two conference loss-
es in these seven years. That’s called
dominance, not parity. Everybody else is
in the conference is ﬁghting for second
through ninth spots. How many people
out there are wondering who is going to
win the ACC each year? That’s what I
thought. .

Let’s see who’s on top of the Big Ten
this year. What do you know, it’s
Michigan and Ohio State.

You can probably include Penn‘ State
in that group, as well. Even ‘though the
Nittany Lions have only been in the Big
Ten for a few years, they’ll always be at
the top. .

Then there are the consummate
mediocre teams that beat up each other to
get their wins. This group includes Iowa,
Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Purdue,
Michigan State and Northwestern. Yes, I
know Northwestern went to the Rose
Bowl a couple of years ago, but it just
had a ﬂuke season. The rest of these
schools will never consistently battle for
a title or prove to be formidable oppo-
nents to the powerhouses. . j V

Until this year, it has been Nebraska
and everybody else in the Big 12. Of
course, Kansas State still needs to prove
it has overcome the Comhusker hurdle

country to play exhibition games,
spoiled Pitt’s preseason party with a
92-90 overtime victory fueled by a
52 percent three-point shooting per-
formance.

“They shot the lights out
tonight,” Pitt forward Ricardo
Greer said.

Pitt jumped out to an early 19-
12 lead with five quick points from
Kellii Taylor, before Marathon
stormed back to make the score 19-
18 with 8:45 remaining in the first
half.    .

Taylor was a major factor’ in the
game for the Panthers, who were
playing without guards Vonteego
Cummings and Stephen Flores, both
lost to hand injuries. There is no
word on when either will return.

Pitt ran the score to 40-37 by

Ricardo Greer led the Panthers

the half. The Panthers were up 40-
35 before Erwin Claggett made a
layup with 1:50 remaining.

Neither team did anything in the
last two minutes of the first half,
and they went to the locker room
with the Panthers up by three.

Most of the first half featured

   

little dump passes inside to Attila
Cosby and Isaac Hawkins. Both big
men were able to seal off defenders
and get easy layups.

Hawkins would keep his man
between him and the ball, and then
take the lob pass from a guard.

Hawkins finished with 10 points _
in the half and Cosby with four, but

Cosby also hadthree fouls.

Taylor added 11 points in a ”

good first half of play. He shot four
of six from the ﬂoor and three of
four from behind the three point
arc.

Marathon only went through the
motions‘ in the first half, shooting
33 percent from three-point range
and not doing anything spectacular.

The second half was completely
different for Marathon. It came out

with a vengeance and ready to shoot '

the three.
“We did a real good job in the

first half of stopping the three, but‘

in the second half we didn’t do a
real good job,” Pitt head coach
Ralph Willard said.

Marathon shot 69 percent on
three-pointers, and that led the team

‘to the win. Marathon fought Pitt j

Coach Willard knew it .

The Pitt Panthers knew it.

And by the end of the game, everyone
at the Fitzgerald Field House laiew that the
Marathon basketball team can shoot the
three-point shot.

“I was happy with our perimeter
defense in the ﬁrst half, we held them to
only six three-point attempts,” said Willard.

But in the second half, despite some
exciting offensive basketball by the
Panthers, the Marathon team caught ﬁre.

And with the long ball, they gave the
home team a taste of its own medicine.

Marathon made nine three-pointers in
the second half, and with its ﬁnal one, the
team took the lead for good.

Brilliant three-point shooting by Marathon last night sent the Panthers
into an unexpected overtime. Pitt lost by only two points, 92-90.

Although varsity crew ﬁnished its
fall season last week in Virginia, the
novice men and women had one more
race to go. '

Washington’s Landing hosted the
Car-Du-Pitt, an armual event showcasing
Pittsburgh teams including Carnegie
Mellon, Duquesne and Pitt. Robert
Morris and Mercyhurst were also invit-
ed.

Duquesne pulled out a win in the
annual race this year, taking home the

COLUMN

by beating Nebraska this weekend.

I’ll give the rest of the teams credit
for being competitive against each other,
but until they rise to the top and chal-
lenge the big boys, I’ll stick to raking
leaves instead of watching them get
squashed on national television.

How many conferences out there
still have four teams in legitimate con-
tention for a conference title? One. The
Big East.

Syracuse, Miami, Virginia Tech and
West Virginia are all bunched up atop the
Big East and will battle each other, along
with other conference foes, over the next
month to decide a champion. Miami used
to be a powerhouse until NCAA sanc-
tions hampered its program for a few
years. The Hurricanes appear to have
recovered nicely and are once again chal-
lenging recent champions Syracuse,
Virginia Tech and West Virginia.

g Each team is capable of winning all
of its remaining games, and believe it or
not, each team could lose more than one
of its remaining games.

That’s because the bottom of the Big
East has proven to be no pushover, with
Temple, Rutgers and Boston College
having two conference wins apiece and
Pitt being a tough opponent for everyone
in the conference. '

Many football fans» see this parity as
a ﬂaw and believe that it somehow weak-
ens the image of the Big East. Hardly! ‘
The Big East is a well-rounded, compet-
itive football conference that provides, to
say the least, entertaining football.

Big East teams are on the rise and
will continue to make this conference
stronger. I’m not concerned with what
the Big East teams do outside of the con-
ference, for it is well known that this ele-
ment must improve drastically.

If you're going to rate a conference,
you have to look at the competition with-
in that conference, and I have yet to see a
conference provide more entertainment
than the Big East.

Robert Morris came in second, while
Pitt came in third, followed by Carnegie

The Panthers made their own three-

ties. Freshman Fred Primus hitthree from
downtown, while shooting guard Jarrett
Lockhart hit two, and Taylor led the way by
connecting on ﬁve of eight beyond the arc.

ber  iWe?1;e pligping to pick up
even more for the spring sprint season.
The past eight to 10 weeks have shown
good potential, and I’m very optimistic
about the spring.”

This is Gallik’s first year coaching at
the college level. For the past eight years,
he coached at area high schools includ-

ing North Catholic, Central Catholic and

Northem Allegheny.
Jean Meta, the novice women’s

coach, has been coaching at Pitt since
. last year.

The women entered six boats,

including three eights and three fours.

Lazell Durden picked up one.

The Panthers controlled the game with
their aggressive defensive schemes and
some well-executed otfensive possessions.

Pitt’s motion oifense got everyone
involved in the attack. The team was led by
Ricardo Greer’s game-high 20 points" and
18 rebounds. Isaac Hawkins also added 18
points and 17 boards.

‘ But every time the Panthers tried to
pull away, the Marathon shooters kept them
close. A

“We need better ‘transition defense,
especially against a team with shooters,”
said Willard, who compared Marathon
with Pitt’s upcoming opponent, University
of Baltimore, Maryland County.

“We felt this would be a good team to
prepare us for UBMC, because they both
play with similar styles,” he said. A

The Panthers return to action this
Friday at Fitzgerald Field House.

    
  

. .

With the fall season ﬁnished, both
novice and varsity still have the indoor
winter season to look forward to.

In February, Winchester-Thurston, a
Pittsburgh high school, will host an
indoor race. Depending on the crew’s
perfonnance there, Pitt may earn an invi-
tation -to the Crash B’s, the nation’s
largest indoor race, which ‘is held in
Boston.

At the end of March, spring training
will begin, and the sprint season will start
with Pitt heading to Bucknell.

YOU can "be part of the growing movement to prepare to

meet the needs of tomorrow’s children by enrolling in the

design to promote positive child and youth development.
