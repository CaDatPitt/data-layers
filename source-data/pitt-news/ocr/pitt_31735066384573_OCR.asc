Congress Argues Student Aid

ByJIMMORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Although there appears to be general support in
Congress for increased federal aid to students from
middle-income families, there is considerable
disagreement on what form the aid should take.

Currently, there are three educational aid bills
under consideration by Congress.

In the Senate, a bill sponsored by Senators Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and
William Roth, Jr., R-Del, would allow up to $500 a
year in tax credits for each student.

The credits would apply equally to college and
elementary-secondary students enrolled in both
private and parochial schools.

This measure has passed the Senate Finance
Committee and is expected to reach the Senate ﬂoor
next month.

The Carter Administration opposes tax credits and
has proposed as an alternative legislation aimed at
beeﬁng up federal grant and loan programs.

A third piece of legislation, a modiﬁed version of
Carter’s proposal, has also been introduced in the
House.

By "a vote of 218-156, the House last week refused to
consider the so-called Student Assistance bill that
would give grants to students from families whose

incomes are as much as $25,000 a year, would give
federally-guaranteed loans to families with incomes
up to $40,000, and would provide more work-study
jobs.

However, according to Pitt director of student aid
Frank Dutkovich, who was in Washington for last
week's vote, “the bill is by no means dead.”

“Both ideas have a lot of support, and it will be
interesting to see what happens,” he said. “There
seems to be sentiment in Congress for making a
package deal, including both tax credits and increased
loans and grants.”

However, in making his proposal last month,
President Carter warned that he would not accept both
credits and an increase in existing programs.

But tax credits, which have been called “politically
popular” by some, may go through despite a Carter
veto.

In the last three years the Senate three times passed
tuition tax credit bills, but the House refused to go
along. And this year, House leaders have said they
may try to head off grade school and high school
credits and allow college tuition credits to go through.

William Maloni, assistant to Congressman William
Moorhead, said many Congressmen are uneasy about
the inclusion of parochial schools in the tax credit bill.

Pitt parking is one traffic problem ex-
plored in a survey sponsored jointly
by Pitt and the city.

Survey Views
Headaches In
Area Traffic

By SUE McFARI.AND

Pitt News Staff Writer

A ten-month study of Oakland
transportation is seeking answers
to the long standing problem of
traffic congestion, lack of parking
and public transportation to and

I from the area.

The study, headed by Pitt
environmental engineer, Dr. A.G.
R. Bullen, is a result of
recommendations by Oakland Di-
rectors Incorporated (ODI), a
community advisory group.

The study, launched March 8, is
being funded jointly by the
University and the city.

Its ‘formation was prompted by
Oakland’s commercial impact on
Pittsburgh as a heavily concen-
trated center of trade, employ-

Kathy Stevens, newly elected
president of the School of General
Studies Student Cabinet, plans to
form a broad base of support to
accomplish her campaign goals.
During her first weeks in office,
Stevens ‘said, she wants to
incorporate her former rivals in the
election into the new cabinet.

“After the election, I did
approach the other candidates, and
we have agreed by concensus to
work together,” said Stevens. “I
will approach Debbie Alpert, also,
and make every attempt to have
her join with us in the coming
year.”

Until she meets with the new
cabinet this week, Stevens is not
certain which of her platform goals
she will first try to accomplish.

“I would like to first meet with
the cabinet and stress that we
should work as a team,” said the

cabinet president. “I want to get
together with the other winners,
and work toward our common
goals.”

Stevens won the cabinet presi-
dential election last week, gaining
260 votes to Debbie Alpert’s 190.

‘Other newly elected cabinet mem-

bers are Kerry Clancy, Rose Dolfi,
Elbert Johnson and Cheryl Peck.

Alpert, though disappointed by
her loss, said she will consider an
offer of a cabinet appointment.

“It depends on whether I can get
the position I want,” Alpert said.
“I don’t know how willing they will
be to give out positions. I would
like to be head of a committee. I
think I might rather do something
for the University, rather than just
SGS, but I can’t say what I will do
right now.”

Stevens, formerly SGS Judiciary
Chairperson, SGS Annual Picnic
Committee member, student rep-
resentative on the Provost Commit-
tee for Undergraduate Programs
and a University Senate member,
said she believed her credentials
decided the election in her favor.

“I have been very involved in
SGS, and I think this was
recognized. Some people, espe-
cially younger ones, rallied to my
side because of this,” said Stevens.

Alpert claimed members of the
1977-78 Student Cabinet had
practiced dirty politics against her.
Alpert added, however, that she did
not believe Steve“ was involved.

Reports on allegations by a
former Night Times editor, who
claimed Alpert offered to pay him

to rewrite a story about her,

especially upset Alpert.

U.S. ‘Racism’ Topic of Foreign Policy Talks Here

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staffwriter

Racism in United States foreign policy was
the subject of four lectures held by the Student
Union Board Monday evening.

Speakers for the program included Prof.
John Beverly of Hispanic studies, Prof.
Richard Cottam, political science; Prof.
Emmanuel Anise, black studies; and Carole
Collins of the Coalition for the Liberation of
South Africa. T

Beverly, addressing Latin American foreign
policy, said the United States has a history of
stereotyping Latin Americans.

He pointed out that Latin American societies
are “inherently” racist, claiming United
States foreign policy has failed to overcome the
problem.

“We have come to view Latin American
people as charming, but erratic and Frito
banditos,” Beverly said. “White. conquerers
have destroyed Latin American cultures. We
have had semi-colonial and direct colonial

control of Latin America, and tried to make
Latin American countries more like the U.S.”

Cottam, a Middle East specialist, said,
“Racist foreign policy is too gross a statement,
and there are other things that are more
important.

“We have a contemptuous attitude toward
people we see as technologically inferior,” he
said. “A strong case could be made that a
yearning for unity on the part of Arab nations
has been stopped by the U.S. and the United
Kingdom.” .

“In order for a Middle East country to be
considered moderate and responsible and get
U.S. support,” Cottam said, “it must be
anti-Communist, accomodating to our econo-
mic interests and limit its hostility to Israel to
rhetoric. V

“And the U.S. has pretty well doomed
democracy through CIA intervention in Arab
countries,” Cottam added.

Anise said American “contempt” toward

black Africa stems from the United States
“growing up fast with little suffering.”

“American foreign policy in Africa has
always been anti-social revolutionary,” Anise
said, “and that means going against the spirit
of the Third World.

“America has maintained the same colonial
attitude that Africans don’t know what’s good
for them,” Anise continued. “American
capitalism is at the expense of Third World

' countries, and this tends to maintain the status

quo, regardless of the forces of history.”

Concluding the program, Collins, focusing
on South Africa, claimed “U.S. attitudes and
behaviors over a long period of years has been
blatantly racist.

“The U.S. has continually supported
multinationals that have strengthened the
apartheid regime,” she said.

“There is a great difference between
rhetoric and reality,” Collins added. “And the
U.S. has had an abyssmal U.N; voting record in
supporting majority rule in South Africa.”

Survey Explores Oakland Transportation Problems

ment, housing and other public
services. Oakland also is the
largest centralized health care and
educational center in western
Pennsylvania and also serves as
a major artery of transp station.
Concern was raised that thL serious
transportation problen‘-s might
hamper the effectiveness or plans
for future expansion of any one of
these operations, according to a
copy of the survey.

Bullen also noted that the city and
the University both had funds
allocated speciﬁcally for the study
of Oakland traffic and agreed it
might be more ﬁnancially feasible
to combine resources so as to avoid
possible overlapping of survey
areas. The total cost of the survey
has been estimated at $50,000, an
equal portion of which will be
absorbed by the two sponsors.

The study will encompass a
survey of all transients (University

of hospitals, merchants and all
other visitors to Oaklar;-7), their
means of transportation to and
from the area and the total distance
from their point of origin to their
exact ﬁnal destination.

An inventory of available park-
ing—and restrictions regarding
availability and costs placed upon
it—will be undertaken. Transit
service (stops, schedules and
routes) will be surveyed, in
addition to effects of traffic signals
on the control of both pedestrian
and motor congestion.

“We feel our number one goal is
to alleviate some obvious traffic
and parking problems in Oakland,
aside from some more technical
problems,” Bullen said, “Through
this study, which is a good
quantitative analysis, we have a
fairly good chance of doing this.”

University faculty and staff are
being surveyed by telephone or
mail, while students are being
questioned in randomly selected
classroom sessions on Wednesday
only.

The most recent study of
Oakland’s transportation woes,

conducted in 1969, was titled the
“Ramp Report” and concluded
that Oakland needed some 600
additional parking spaces, accord-
ing to Student Government Board
member Diane Behers.

“The reports came in but
nothing was done,” Behers said.
“This is always a problem.”

Behers added that at that time
the possibility was raised of an $8.5
million underground parking ga-
rage in Schenley Park that would
accomodate 1,200 automobiles.
That proposal, however, was
quickly shot down by the city on the
grounds that it was not what was
needed to solve Oakland’s pro-

- blems.

When the results of this l'I10.";t
recent survey are compiled in late
December of this year, Bullen said
the group will seek feedback from
groups in Oakland that are directly
affected by the traffic problems,
such as the SGB and commuters.

“We need their interest, advice
and counsel if something is to be
ione,” Bullen said.

Behers said several suggestions
have already been discussed

It’s great to be away from home. Then again, sometimes you just want to go

station-to-station, between 5 and 11 P.M., you’ll be able to talk for ten minutes

concerning the alleviation of traffic
problems, including the staggering
of work hours, instituting more car
pools and improving bus service to
the area.

Behers said Student Government
also has submitted several preli-
minary suggestions such as a
mid-city bus loop from Oakland to
Shadyside and East Liberty; a
move to modify parking form two
hours to four and four-hour meters
to eight.

“Implementing results of the
study is our largest problem,”
Bullen said. “We have the facts,
but they are worthless unless some
action is taken.”

Scientist Speaks For Layman As Noted Lecturer

By GAIL M. SIMMONS
Pin News Siafiwrirer

The first in what is to be an
annual series of lectures at Pitt
beganiMonday night as Dr. Paul
Berg, Wilson Professor of biochem-
istry at Stanford University, lec-
tured on “The Dissection and
Reconstruction of the Molecules of
Heredity: An Expanding Chemical
Frontier.” This was the first talk in
a series of three that Berg will
give on the subject of genetic
engineering and its social conse-
quences.

This first lecture in the Distin-
guished Lecturer Series was
introduced by Chancellor Posvar
and by Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg. Rosen-
berg said the lecture series was
designed to appeal to a “generally
intelligent adult audience."

Berg, a member of Stanford’s
biochemistry department since
1959, has received numerous
awards for his research on modes
of gene expression in growth and
cell division. But he is also known
as an excellent lecturer, having

Student Aid Programs
Argued By Congress

(Continued from Page I)

Maloni said passage of the bill is
sure to raise constitutional issues,
and Dutkovich said there was talk in
Washington that the Supreme
Court would rule the legislation
unconstitutional.

Dutkovich was in Washington
representing Pitt in the National
Association of Student Financial
Aid Administrators (NASFAA).

“NASFAA believes the Student
Assistance bill is more viable and
more beneficial to more people,’
Dutkovich said.

“The increased aid would
virtually double the number of
students eligible for grants,” he

added. “But tax credits would give u

 

money to everyone, even those who
don’t need more assistance."

“If Senator Heinz had a son or
daughter in college, his family
would be eligible for the tax credit,"
he said.

Dutkovich also said some finan-
cial aid directors at other universi-
ties have expressed fear that
approval of tax credits would mean
“no increases in (federal) student
aid for 10 years.”

The Treasury Department has
estimated that Carter’s program
would cost $1.2 billion, while tax
credits would cost $4.5 billion yearly
when the legislation reaches its full
effect.

received the Henry Kaiser teaching
award at Stanford.

Speaking for the layman, Berg
reviewed the basic principles of
genetics upon which the experi-
ments of genetic engineering are
founded. Beginning in the late
l800’s with Mendel’s laws of
heredity. and continuing into the
early 1950's when Watson and
Crick discovered the structure of
the basic molecule of heredity,
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the
science of genetics laid a founda-
tion for the recombinant DNA
experiments that are causing such
a furor among citizens.

Berg said the most frequently
used organisms in genetic engi-
neering studies are the bacterium
Escherichia coli (E.coli) and a
variety of viruses. These are used
because they can be easily and
quickly grown in the laboratory and
because they have small, easily
manipulated chromosomes.

Human chromosomes, which
contain over 1,000 times as much
DNA as E.coli, are too large to be
easily handled in the laboratory, he
said.

In the second lecture of the
series, which was yesterday, Berg
discussed the techniques used in
recombinant DNA experiments.
He described how small pieces of
DNA from higher organisms can be
introduced into E.coli cells where

they will reproduce many times.

These multiple copies of genes can
then be studied in detail to
determine their chemical structure.

The area of greatest promise in
these experiments lies in the
possibility of inserting the genes
for important proteins such as
insulin or thyroid hormone into
bacterial cells. Once in the bacter-
la, these genes would reproduce as
often as the bacteria do, every 20
minutes. If the genes could then be
made to operate, a large amount of
their products could be made
cheaply in a short time.

This technique could be literally
a life saver for many people,
because it would eliminate a
possible shortage of therapeutic
proteins such as insulin. Cur-
rently obtained from sheep, insu-
lin, which is used to treat diabetes,
could be obtained in the lab from
cultures of E.coli containing that
gene. A five-gallon ﬂask of E.coli
could produce as much insulin as a
million sheep.

The final lecture in the series will
be held tomorrow at 4 p.m. in the
Stephen Foster Memorial auditor-
ium. Berg’s last public lecture will
deal with the dangers of recombi-
nant DNA research and the social
consequences of such studies. He
will discuss recent legislation
under consideration in several
states to limit recombinant DNA
studies and what such legislation
could mean to the research
community.

There will be a more technical
discussion of Berg's most recent
research today at 4:15 p.m. in
Room A169 Crawford Hall, and a
general question and answer
session on Friday at 9 a.m. in 343
Crawford.

“I feel one primary cause of my

said Alpert. “Due to the backing of
Stevens by a majority of the

consider the Student Assistance Bill, which is the most promising
proposal to supply more aid to college students increasingly feeling

the inflationary pinch.

Other possible student aid bills are fraught with problems. One
bill, allowing a $500 tax credit for all college students, also gives
this tax credit to students attending private and parochial elemen-
tary and secondary schools. The bill would probably be rejected by
the Supreme Court and students would be left with no increased

aid. ’

The Student Assistance Bill, providing grants for students’
families with an income of $25,000 or less, and loans to families
with an income of $40,000 or less, would give a much bigger boost
in aid to those students now getting the short end of the deal during

aid appropriation.

Though these students’ families are affluent

enough not to receive aid under present aid programs, their families
do not«earn enough to be able to totally fund several children’s

post—secondary education.

As a result, only the very poor and the very rich parents can af-
ford to send their children to the more exclusive, and expensive, of
the nation’s colleges and universities. Many promising students are
shunted aside into less prestigious colleges only because they can
afford to attend no other school. Forcing students to attend less
expensive schools sometimes not able to give them the best possible
education causes our nation to suffer.

At Pitt, many students feel the pressure of increasing tuition
costs without the possibility of any lessening of their financial
responsibility through grants or loans. While tuition rises at a rate

of four percent annually,

unchanged criteria,

deciding the

eligibility of students for aid, makes it impossible for students to
keep even with the rate of inflation.

Though the cost of the Student Assistance Bill could prove to be
great, the final reward gained by ensuring every student can attend
the college he chooses, and thus reach his full potential, outweighs

the costs.

It is possible the House may revive the Student Assistance Bill.

Let us hope they do.

N otre Dame Fans N ot Most Obnoxious

Bob Labriola’s article about the
-NCAA collegiate semi-ﬁnals refer-
red to Notre Dame fans as the
“most pompous and obnoxious in
and furthermore
labeled them “arrogant.” Appar-
ently Labriola does not know too
much about the University of Notre
Dame. 1 do not know which “fans”
in particular he mentioned, but the
ones I have known throughout my
life have been some of the kindest
and most pleasant people anyone

could hope to meet.

Such experiences, in addition to
Notre Dame’s impeccable academic
credentials, induced me to attend
the school, where I received my
degree last year. The students of
Notre Dame do ‘not resemble
anything close to what Labriola
said, in fact, they were the very
opposite. Ask any visitors to the
campus, and you will ﬁnd hardly
another campus in this country in
which students will go out of their

way to assist them. Notre Dame is
much more than a university; it also
is a community in which everyone
feels he or she belongs.

Yes, the students and we alumni
are proud of the university, and with
good reason, but not in the arrogant
manner described in this absurd
and biased article.

King Murder Left Blacks With Void Never Filled

Editor’s Note: This is the second in a
series of columns about the events of
1968, their impact at that time, and their
repercussions on America today.

By R. DAVID TIVE

The assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King in Memphis in April of
1968 was an event which truly
marked the end of an era. For a
decade and a half, King had been
the unrivaled leader of the civil
rights movement in this country.

He had been responsible for
pricking the consciences of many
people and making them realize
that, whether or not they had
actively discriminated against
blacks, they had better actively
help in the ﬁght to end that
discrimination, both for their own
sakes and for that of the black
citizens.

He was also responsible for
shining light on those who felt that

blacks should be discriminated
against and were inherently in-
ferior to whites. For the ﬁrst time,
the ‘racists were challenged and
forced to defend their beliefs in
public.

King’s murder in the spring or
that fateful year had two major
effects at the time, one of which is
still a problem today. The murder
touched off nationwide rioting in
the black sections of most major
cities. While the rioting was not as
bad as that which had earlier
destroyed large portions of Ne-
wark, Detroit and Los Angeles, it
was of sufficient severity to leave
many people homeless, injure
hundred of others and destroy
many businesses.

One of the most interesting
aspects of the 1968 rioting is the
fact that it was the last great urban
rioting we have seen in this
country. The era of the riots,
beginning in the long, h- summer

of 1964, and running  through
the King assassination. accom-
plished little of value for the blacks,
and probably did them harm
through the damage done to their
homes and businesses, But after
1968, it stopped.

It is hard to pick one reason and say
that it is why the rioting stopped,
just as it is impossible to single out
one reason for why it started. One
factor that can, however, be written
off, is the contribution of the federal
Government. Even if the new
politics initiated by the Government
following the report of the National
Advisory Commission on Civil
Disorders, released in early 1968,
had any effect, they certainly could
not be felt by the summer of 1969.

Yet that summer, and all the
summers since then, have been
quiet. Why? I think the answer lies
partly in the second major effect of
the assassination of King.

With the death of Martin Luther
King, the civil rights movement
was left leaderless. King was, even
to those within the black commun-
ity who disagreed with him, the
most forceful, dynamic and popular
leader they had. But, there was no
one with those qualities to take his
place. People like Ralph Abernathy
and Roy Wilkins tried. Though they
had worked closely with Kin g, none
of these men could command the
personal. loyalty King had, or
provide the leadership necessary to
insure continued progress for the
movement and for black people in
America.

Just as the “moderates” such as

Abernathy and Wilkins cou1dn’t ﬁll
the void, neither could the

“radicals.” Stokely C2 nichel,
Eldridge Cleaver and Bob; 1.’ Seale,
among others, all tried 2. 1 failed.
These men, whilerthey may have
had the personal qualities that
made King such a great leader, had’
positioned themselves too far from
the mainstream of black life in the
United States. The average man in
the street simply could not accept
them, their lifestyle .2 .d their
rhetoric all in one dose. 1: was too
much to take.

I THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

‘But, perhaps even more impor-
tant than leaving blacks leaderless,
the King assassination left them
without any acceptable rol.e models
to follow. Not only did Martin
Luther King achieve a great deal for
the blacks in America, but he set an
example for them to follow. He
demonstrated qualities that they,
and all others, could aspire to. He
lived his life in a way that fellow
blacks could hope to mirror.

Since 1968, look at the role
models available to blacks. On
television they have a choice of
George Jefferson, Fred Sanford or
Jimmy “J.J.” Walker, none of
whom is likely to inspire a young
black man to achieve as much as he
possibly can. In politics, the
situation is the same.

There are very few blacks of any
national prominence in politics, and
of those who are, only Julian Bond
seems likely to inspire a
continued effort for excellence.
Black women don’t have quite the
same problem. The female counter-
parts of the black men on television

are for the most part, the kind of
people one could look up to. In
politics, there are women like
Barbara Jordan and Coretta King
to model one’s life after.

Only" in sports are there a large
number of people that a young
black man can emulate. The only
problem is that success 11‘; sports is
a personal thing-—it benefits you
and your family, but does nothing
for anyone else. Success in politics,
education, the arts or any of the
other ﬁelds where there are few if
any reasonable role models to
follow, helps both the individual
and his or her society.

This then, is the lasting legacy
and tragedy of the assassination of
Martin Luther King. As long as he
was alive, he gave a sense of
identity to blacks, by his own
personal qualities. Since his death,
that is gone.

Programs in Black Studies and
other activities designed to in-
crease black awareness are trying
to ﬁll the gap, but it is much
harder, and takes much more time
to do it that way than if there were
a leader who could do it by personal
will. That could explain why there
have been no major riots since
1968. There is no point in rioting
and causing all that damage to
yourself and your friends if you
don’t know why you are rioting.

The year 1968 saw the destruc-
tion of the organized black
movement in this country. It has
not yet been put back together, and
it won’t be for a long time unless a
new black leader, a new Martin
Luther King, emerges.

Next: The assassination of Robert
Kennedy.

Jackson Browne Is Running On Talent

Leland Sklar on bass, Craig Doerge ‘

- Pi! Newsstaffvlriter
Runnhg (h E-pty
Jacksc Browne
Asylum

Although Jackson Browne may
not cut as many albums as his
enthusiasts might prefer, he
maintains a level of quality rarely
matched by recording artists.

‘ ‘Running On Empty,” Browne’s
ﬁfth album, is comprised of live
performances taken from his most
recent concert tour. Unlike many
live albums, the songs on ‘ ‘Running
On Empty” do not appear on any of

ARTS

his previous albums, and only a few
of the cuts are from actual concert
performances.

The remainder of the album was
recorded in such unlikely places as
in one of the motel rooms where the
band stayed during the tour and
backstage of the Saratoga Perfor-
ming Arts Center.

Despite the unprofessional
atmosphere surrounding many of
the cuts, the quality of the music
does not suﬁer. In fact, the album
might even encourage avid concert
goers to catch Browne on his next

tour, for concerts have degenerated
into acts that belong in the center
ring of a circus rather than the stage
of a concert hall.

The title track of the album is one
of the two recorded at the
Merriweather Post Pavilion in
Columbia, Md., during one of the
stops along the tour. “Running On
Empty,” is a ballad that deals with
one aspect of life on the road.
Browne and David Lindley share the
musical spotlight on piano and lap
steel, respectively.

Browne does a rendition of Danny
O’Keefe’s ballad about life on a
nationwide concert tour entitled
“The Road.” This cut was also
recorded in Columbia, but was done
in a Cross Keys Inn motel room.

“Rosie,” a song that is similar in
style to “Ready Or Not” from
Browne’s second album, “For
Everyman,” is a story about losing
a girl’s love to a drummer.
Browne’s keyboard work is the
song’s only music, and the unique
quality of his voice contributes to
the somber tone of the lyrics.

Lindley’s fiddle playing is
featured in “Cocaine,” a song
written by the Reverend Gary
Davis. The song is reminiscent of
Bob Dylan in that Browne, the lead
vocalist, is almost talking rather
than singing with the music.

Throughout the album, Browne
relies on music from conventional

instruments, avoiding the syn-
thesized sounds that dominate
many contemporary LP’s. This is a
refreshing change, and comforting
to many who fear that musicians are
being replaced by electronics
experts.

Fans followed

who have

Browne’s career will enjoy “Run-
ning On Empty,” because it is one
of his ﬁner albums, and people
unfamiliar with Browne’s style will
enjoy the LP, because it is classic
entertainment.

Fine supporting performances
from Russell Kunkel on drums.

on keyboards and Danny Kortchmar
on guitars add to the quality of the
album.

“Running On Empty” is a
worthwhile addition to any record
collection—even if you have to pay
for the album.

Jackson Browne’s new album, “Running On Empty,” was recorded live—not only in concert, but aboard a bus.
Browne’s previous album, “The Pretender,” made his talent as a singer known to a wider audience—-before, he
was best known for his song writing. Currently, Browne is promoting Warren Zevon.

Hollis F rampton ’s F ilms--An Experience

Hollis Frampton’s words intri-
gued his audience Tuesday night at
the Carnegie Museum of Art as
much as his two color ﬁlms, ‘ ‘Vernal

educational and entertaining, but
mainly directed toward those who
appreciate abstract art in film.

“Vernal Equinox” is an excerpt
from Frampton’s “Straits of
Magellan,” which includes a ﬁlm
for every day of the year. The first
day of each season is celebrated
with a longer ﬁlm than the others.
“Vernal Equinox” marks the

Asylum

If you like Joni Mitchell, you’ll
love her latest offering, “Don
Juan’s Reckless Daughter.” A
double album with no more than
four songs on each side, “Don
Juan” contains 11 cuts.

Mitchell wrote all but one song
and plays guitar or piano through-
out the recording, which has the soft

one of the photographers who ﬁrst
experimented with the concept of
ﬁlm in the 1890’s. Muybridge’s
subjects coincided with those of the
impressionist painters _of the time
(everyday, routine scenes), as does
Frampton’s subject matter in this
ﬁlm. It is 62 mintues of a nude girl
performing basic activities, like
bouncing balls, sitting in chairs,
lying down and moving in different
positions.

The sequence of time is broken
down and experimented with, so
that the picture appears jerky, like
an old, silent movie. The ﬁnal
product strongly resembles Muy-
bridge’s moving photographs put
on a revolving drum to give the
illusion of movement; the birth of
cinema.

sound that is prevalent in her
previous pressings.

The second track, “Talk To Me,’ ’
has had plenty of air time on
Pittsburgh radio‘, both AM and FM.
It has some not-so-light-hearted
lyrics that, nevertheless, lean the
listener toward laughter.

“Paprika Plains” is not just the
best song on the album, it’s the best
quarter. Yes, it takes up the whole
second side, and is ﬁlled with some
of the best poetry to pour forth from
Mitchell’s -pen. The images re-

Birth is the theme of this silent
ﬁlm, which was inspired by a dream
Frampton had during his 21st
spring. It is one of his earliest ﬁlms,
also.

When asked why he occasionally
injected a blank, dotted ﬁlm frame
in “Vernal Equinox,’ Frampton,
said, “It shows that the girl is on
ﬁlm. It reminds you that she is an
illusion, and you are imagining the
whole action. It also marks off the
space which she can occupy and
perform in. She unobscures and
reobscures that space.”

Frampton said he has also been
preoccupied with cyclic forms.
Endlessness can be especially
aggravating in ﬁlms, as in Vernal
Equinox,” but Frampton said, ‘‘I
had to ﬁnd out what it looked like.

vealed her melodic memories and
piano work present a classic air.

The third side sounds of the
rhythms of South America rituals,
primarily in the instrumental, ‘ ‘The
Tenth World,” featuring Chaka
Kahn.-, along with Mitchell and a
multitude of others “chanting.”

Things start to look up on the
next track,” “Dreamland,” which
holds to a sufﬁcient samba beat.

In all, carries Mitchell’s meaning
through poetric imagery.

People have a need to see it, though
it troubles them.”

He’s not a follower of Andy
Warhol, who has said he likes
boring things, but is simply
fascinated by the possibilities of
time.

Frampton’s other ﬁlm, “Other-
wise Unexplained Fires,” is his
interpretation of an hallucination,
induced by being blinded during a
scientiﬁc experiment. '

Frampton believes in two modes
of time—-historical, or clock time,
and ecstatic time. Ecstatic time is
our internal sense of time, which is
quickened, or even stopped, by
emotions or physical conditions.
“Otherwise Unexplained Fires”
begins in black and white, with two
early scientists lighting an exper-

The following hallucination is in
ecstatic time: The images quickly
alternate back and forth between
ﬂames, a mechanical horse and
rider and chickens feeding. An egg
appears on the screen a few times.
This continues for about 10
minutes, then the scientists reap-
pear as they were before. The color
hallucination occurred during a very
short clock time, but is drawn out in
ecstatic time in the ﬁlm.

As an experimental ﬁlmmaker,
Frampton doesn’t put ﬁlms to-
gether to please his spectators. His
ﬁlms are experiments and expres-
sions in art. When asked if he is
sincere about his work he said, ‘‘I
am sincere, but sincerity doesn’t
apply to modern art.”

with music so strongly, it could take
10 listenings to understand all the
linesl; the music pulls the interes.
away from the lyric.

The lead vocalist sounds slightly
like Harry Nillson, and some of the
lyrics tend to make the thought
seem more like reality than
coincidence.

“Flashlight,” the song used in
the radio ads, is the worst cut on the
album; it’s lyrics are inane. The rest
of the album, however, soars out of
these depths upon turning the vinyl
wafer onto its second side.

“Lighten Up McGraw” puts
some fine rock sounds into
the cosmos. The title is another
powerful performance of recording
wizardry, overlay upon overlay,
mixing and remixing and variations
of sounds that build up to a fanfare
of voices.

Gymnasts Overcome Injuries To Place Fﬂh in Regionals
Sports

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s men’s gymnastics team
placed ﬁfth in the NCAA Eastern

- Regional Championships at Penn

State last weekend despite a series
of illnesses and injuries that befell
the team just prior to the meet.

“It was just unbelieveable; it
seemed like everything was going
against us,” said head coach Frank
D’Amico of the fractured wrist
sustained by top performer Keith
Wipprecht, and of Doug Smith’s
food poisoning bout on the eve of
the ﬁrst day of competition. With
Wipprecht out of action, Smith
managed to compete in two events
that were vital to Pitt’s overall
success in the meet.

Gale Catlett was named West
Virginia University's head basket-
ball coach at, a press conference
yesterday in Morgantown.

Catlett, who had just completed
his sixth season as basketball coach
at Cincinnati, resigned Monday
ending speculation as to who would
take over for Joedy Gardner, who
was ﬁred earlier this month.

A native of West Virginia,
Catlett had directed the Bearcats to
a 126-44' record and appeared in
three NCAA tournaments and one
NIT tournament during his tenure

I at Cincinnati.

Catlett broke into coaching as an
assistant at the University of
Richmond after lettering on the
1962 and 1963 West Virginia
teams. After three years at
Richmond, Catlett joined Lefty
Driesell for one year at Davidson.

In 1967, Kansas coach Ted
Uwéas after-ea Catlett 5 job as an
assistant and freshman coach. His
ﬁrst-year squads posted a 34-4
record under him.

D’Amico was pleased with his
team’s performance, which bet-
tered its score of last year by more
than 100 points, and, in the process,
captured ﬁfth place in a ﬁeld of 15
schools. Pitt was topped in scoring
by Penn State, Louisiana State,
William & Mary and Georgia.

' “I was really happy with the way
our guys performed, and really
can’t complain about anything,
D’Amico said. “The only thing that
was sort of disappointing was that
we thought if we could score 300

Catlett then moved on to
Kentucky for the 1971-72 season,
where he worked, under the
legendary Adolph Rupp. Both
Owens and Rupp were impressed
with Catlett, and “The Baron”
recommended him highly when the
Cincinnati _iob became available.

“He (Catlett) was responsible for
beating Marquette in the 1972
NCAA’s because of the zone
defense he devised,” Rupp once
said. “He can really recruit, he’s
loyal and he certainly knows
basketball.”

Owens also had high praise for
his one-time assistant.

“I’m real high on the man,”
Owens said. “He’s personable,
dynamic and I hated to lose him.
He’s a good disciplinarian, funda-
mentalist and outstanding recruit-
er.”

Catlett’s 76.2 winning percent-
age places him third in the nation
among active coaches. Of his six
seasons at Cincinnati, Catlett
posted three 20-win seasons with

points, we would take third place.
Well, we scored 301 points, and
took ﬁfth.”

In the individual competition,
which was dominated by eastern
power Penn State, Pitt freshman
Allan Myers, who also fell victim to
injury several weeks ago, placed
seventh in the all-around compet-
ition with a score of 91.4, followed
by teammate Ken Lunt who placed
13th with his score of 72.

“Allan did a great job under the
circumstances,” D’Amico said.

high marks of 25 in both the 1975
and 1976 seasons.

It is believed that West Virginia
gave Catlett a three to four year
contract for an annual salary of
around $35,000 with an additional
$10,000-$15,000 possible from
radio and television appearances.

Catlett, whose Cincinnati team
was defeated by Pitt on a buzzer
shot by Larry Harris in 1976-77,
vowed never to return to the Field
House because of inadequate
facilities. West Virginia makes one
trip to the Field House every year
to play the Panthers.

Catlett, his wife, Anise and
seven-year-old daughter plan to
move to West Virginia sometime
this summer.

Gardner, who began his coach-
ing career as an assistant in the
state of Arizona, was named head
coach at Northern Arizona Mon-
day. Gardner wasﬁred despite
leading the Mountaineers to a
surprising second place ﬁnish in
this year’s Eastern Eight tourna-
ment.

“It’s just a shame that he was
injured before this meet.”

In his ‘short career, Myers has

lead the team in scoring, breaking
and rebreaking many school
records.
' “Ken (Lunz) did a super job for us
this weekend,” D’Amico said. “He
really is a hard-working individual
who is easily coached.

D’Amico said the regional
competition was divided into two
days, the ﬁrst being that of optional
routines determined by the gym-
nast, and the compulsory routines,
which are the same to be used’ in the
1980 Olympics.

“These routines are extremely
difficult, and you have to hand it to
people like our Jim Akisogou, who

learned these compulsories in just
two weeks,” D’Amico said.

Looking ahead to next year,
D’Amico believes the young
Panthers (who lost only one
gymnast to graduation) have an
excellent chance to better their 6-4
record of this year, one of the best
records turned in by the team in 25
years.

“We’ve recruited ﬁve or six of
the best gymnasts in the area,
including three top all-arounders, a
super ring man and a high bar
specialist, D’Amico said.

“All I_ can say for this past
season is that I’m really proud of
these guys, because they really did

the job when it needed to be done.’ ’

Pitt Should Be In the Clear, but Dorsett May Not Be

That Tony Dorsett never earned 117 credits and
will not graduate in the near future should not be
news. His academic record, unless it involves
ineligibility, should be his affair. But what should
have ‘been a relatively innocuous Pittsburgh Press
story concerning athletes in academia has Pitt of-
ficials embarrassed for little reason and has made
Dorsett’s academic achievements a matter of
legitimate interest.

An article in Sunday’s Press (section C, first page)
attempted to describe what Pitt does for its athletes
in the classroom, and how the Panthers’ academic
performance» compares with that of other schools’
athletes, using graduation as a barometer. Anyone
familiar with the relationship between athletic de-
partments and academic departments read the story,
yawned and continued to section D. The average
reader, it seems, was outraged by the “poor” per-
formance of Pitt’s athletes, especially Pitt’s football
players. At least, that’s how Pitt—and many of its
followers-..—saw it.

Pitt was compared with‘West Virginia, Penn State
and Notre Dame. Pitt lagged behind Penn State and
Notre Dame in the story, and the University was
presented as roughly equal to West Virginia. This in-
furiated some apparently naive Pitt followers, and
this made the University somewhat embarrassed.

But Pitt, and those persons who have accused the

. institution of lowering its academic standards in the

pursuit of football excellence, appear to be unaware
(or forget) that Pitt athletes work in an academic
concentration camp when compared to their coun-
terparts at many other schools. Pitt, thanks largely to
_Bruce Murphy, the athletes’ academic counselor, is a
relatively clean school in that athletes are accorded
few, if any, extraordinary academic breaks. It was
not always this way, but it is now.

Pitt’s eligibility standards are higher than the
NCAA’s (though not by much) and, at least during

the past two years, the school’s interest in how its
athletes fare in class has transcended questions of
eligibility and “how low can I go and still get by?”

Football players receive special assistance in class;
anyone who believes they do not must be basking in
bliss, if his ignorance is any indicator. That is
nothing over which Pitt administrators and alumni
need become excited. It happens at every school
whose football team averages more than one win per
season against even poor competition.

 

Gauging a school’s athletes by the number who
graduate in four years is in error; any student in-
volved with a time-consuming activity well may need
more time to graduate.

All of this in no way excuses what has become a
filthy area—colleges’ handling of football.

But the most damaging (to Pitt) aspect of the Press
story was not written by the reporter, illustrated by
the facts and comparisons or inferred by any reader.
It is, however, concerned with statements made by
one of the Pitt athletes contacted in connection with
the article. Tony Dorsett would have been wise to an-
swer almost any question with “no comment.”

Instead, he said he was just three credits short of
graduation and that he planned, as a matter of
“pride,” to return to Pitt soon to complete his
degree.

He was wrong. I .

Dorsett’s academic record at Pitt was not so
illustrious as the standard he set on the football team.

a

In four seasons, he rarely gained less than 100 yards a
game. In four years, he completed fewer than 100
credits. r

There’s nothing wrong with Dorsett’s having am-
massed less than a three-years’ supply of credits
during the four season he spent on or near campus.
But it was wrong to exaggerate so wildly his
achievements, especially when they can be «checked.

Dorsett, almost certainly, performed well enough
in the classroom to be eligible to compete for the
Panthers each season he was here. But he was never
far from the minimum standard in credits earned,
and he had completed 88 credits as Pitt went to New
Orleans for the Sugar Bowl that made the Panthers
national champions. His publicized major was
speech, but the number of speech credits applicable
toward graduation wouldn’t even give him a minor.
His final winter term produced a report card of I’s.

In defense of Dorsett, it must be said he learned
more at Pitt than do many students who graduate.
And while a Pitt diploma is nothing special to an
average student, what Dorsett learned at Pitt away
from Pitt Stadium will benefit him tremendously.

There’s very little wrong with what Pitt is doing for
and with its athletes academically—at least, little that
doesn’t go on everywhere from State College to
South Bend to the Southwest and the West Coast.

And, in some ways, Pitt’s concern for athletes’
academic welfare is laudable. So the University
should not, in any account, emerge embarrassed or
scathed by its melding of academics and athletics.

Tony Dorsett, on the other hand, might do well in
the future to let his legs to his talking. It’s unlikely
Converse asked to.see his transcript before signing
Dorsett to a million-dollar promotional contract, and
it is equally certain the public should have little con-
cern for his academic record-—unless he, unwisely,
ignites the conversation.

Duke’s appointment with des-
tiny was delayed for, at least one
year Monday when Kentucky,
sparked by 41 points from Jack
Givens, defeated the Blue Devils,
94-88, in the NCAA basketball
ﬁnals, at the Checkerdome in St.
Louis.

Givens, who fell three points shy
of the NCAA championship game
scoring record set by Bill Walton in
1973, electrified the crowd of 18,721

converting 18 of 26 from the
d, and adding ﬁve free throws.

Kentucky’s ﬁfth national title
culminated a season ﬁlled with
pressure for coach Joe B. Hall and
his players. At a basketball factory
like Kentucky or UCLA, a string of
seasons without a national cham-
pionship is definite cause for alarm.

“This has been a season without
celebration for us at Kentucky,”
said Hall. “So much has been
expected of us...there has been so

much pressure. It’s been real
tough.”
Givens caught fire midway
through the first half, scoring 16
points in a row, and 18 of the
Wildcats’ last 20 points before
intermission to send the Blue Devils
into the lockerroom down, 45-38.

Pitt’s baseball team, by opening
its season in the prestigious
California-Riverside collegiate
tournament, last year received what
starting centerﬁelder Don Nania
called “a deﬁnite jump” on its
opponents.

By playing such respected teams
as Arizona and California early, the
Panthers, Nania reasoned, “had to
be readier sooner” for its season
than its opponents, most of whom
stayed home to play teams
considerably less tough than those
Pitt played on the west coast.

With season-opening tourna-
ments like last year’s not a yearly
thing for Pitt, the Panthers won’t be
given a similar opportunity to get a
big jump on its opponents this

season. So, instead of traveling to‘

California, the Panthers will go to
Robert Morris College in Moon
Township to open its season with a
doubleheader against the Colonials
Friday.

While Robert Morris is a far cry
from Arizona, this fact shouldn’t
bother the Panthers, team captain
Nania noted. -

bids for next year’s tournament
from 21 to 16, the Eastern Eight
winner has been guaranteed a
berth.

The Eastern Eight has a 5-5
NCAA tournament record to rank it
sixth among the conferences.
Villanova was 2-1 this year, and in
1975-76 Rutgers advanced to the
ﬁnal four.

The 16 conferences with the best
winning percentage in the tourn-
ament over the past ﬁve years will
receive the automatic bids, and the

seven other conferences will be
lumped with the independents
seeking an at-large berth.

‘The Atlantic Coast Conference
has the best tournament record at
18-7, the Big 10 is second at 17-8
and the Paciﬁc-10 is third with a
19-10 mark.

The conferences that will likely
lose the automatic berths are the
Southland, East Coast Conference,
ECAC Metro, Ohio Valley, Ivy
League, ECAC Upstate New York,
Big Sky, Missouri Valley and ECAC
New England.

Larry Demery, 24-year-old pitch-

been sold to the Toronto Blue Jays

Demery had asked to be traded

General Manager Pete Peterson

Phillies were interested in a trade,
but the Pirates’ price of two major
leaguers and two minor league
players was too high.

“No one called me about
Demery,” said Peterson. “I never
spoke to the Phillies about
Demery.”

Peterson was going to ask
Demery to go to Columbus until his
arm came around from an injury
sustained in spring training.

Peterson also said the Demery
deal might be the start of future
deals with Toronto.

tournament got us off on the right
foot,” said Nania, noting that it did
more for the Panthers’ prestige
than it did for their won-loss record
(the Panthers ﬁnished around the
.500 mark in the tournament).

“But we still feel good about this
season, too,” the senior from
Pittsburgh’s Point Breeze section
continued. “We think Robert
Morris will give us two good games.
More than anything, we’re looking
forward to starting the season.
We’ve been practicing since
February, and it will be good to start
the season.”

This will be Nania’s third straight
year starting in the outﬁeld for the
Panthers. After transferring from
Boyce Community College before
his sophomore year, the 25-year-old
Nania played a year in rightﬁeld
before moving over to center last
season.

“Since I’m the centerﬁelder, I’m
more or less the leader in the
outﬁeld,” Nania said. “A center-
ﬁelder is in charge of the outﬁeld.
When there’s a ﬂy ball hit out there,
it is his responsibility to call out who
shouldcatch it.”

Besides Nania, eight other

in team free throw percentage) kept
the game close, and made up for 39
percent shooting from the ﬁeld.
Duke hit its ﬁrst 12 attempts from
the line before Jim Spanarkel
missed, and ﬁnished with a 30-of-34
card. Kentucky finished with 10
more ﬁeld goals than Duke, but shot‘
poorly from the line, converting 16
of 25.

Givens’ phenominal performance
made up for Mike Phillips’s and
James _Lee’s _foul trouble early in
the game, as both players picked up
three fouls before the half.

“It’s an unfair rap,” said Hall.
“We're watched by the officials.
There’s no doubt about that.
Sometimes ofﬁcials overreact when
they're calling a Kentucky game.”

The only overreaction by the
ofﬁcials came in the second half
when the Duke coach was assessed
a technical foul for calling a
traveling violation that was missed
by the men in the striped shirts.
Kyle Macy made the two free
throws, and Kentucky scored on the
ensuing possession to push its lead
over the single digit mark.

“That was a quick call,” said
commentator Al McGuire. “Usually
ofﬁcials will call a technical like that
when they missed something on the
court. That’s a heckuva call to make
in a game like this.”

Hall embarrassed himself and the
team by taking his regulars out of
the game a bit too early. When he
had what seemed to be a safe lead,
Hall replaced Macy, Rick Robey and

 

players, including starters Stan
Smodek, Kurt Leitholf (last year’s
top hitter with a .323 average) and
Mark Stephens, 'return for the
Panthers. Important to Nania is that
three of these players—himself,
second baseman Smodek and
shortstop Leitholf——compose what
he called “the core” of the defense.

Nania thinks Pitt should have the
needed strength up the middle
baseball coaches like to talk about.

“It could be the key to our
season,” Nania said. “We have a
couple guys who can hold up the
middle pretty successfully. At least
we think we do.”

Coach Bobby Lewis agreed.

‘ ‘Up the middle, that’s where you
want your defensive strength to
be,” the Panther coach said. “You
want to be strong at second base,
shortstop and centerﬁeld. Since so
many hits have a tendency to go
through the middle, you want
people at these positions who can
stop them from going through and
allowing the base runner to advance
another base or two.”

“We think we have this strength
in Nania, Smodek and Leitholf,”
Lewis said.

Cooks Devi|’s Goose

Truman Claytor only to have Duke
battle back within striking distance
with 22 seconds left in the season.
Fearing Duke’s glass slipper might‘
fit afterall, Hall returned his
starters to the lineup to finish the
game.

Barcalow Hospitalized

Len Barcalow, coach of the
Pitt Hockey Club, has been
hospitalized for an eye injury
incurred in the Panthers’ game
against Dayton in February.

Barcalow was struck in the
left eye by an errant puck that
caused the 69-year-old coach to
experience multiple vision.

Barcalow, who was hospital-
ized earlier in the year for an
affected neck nerve, is under-
going treatment at St. Francis
Hospital.

By The Associated Press

BRADENTON, Fla.—Phil
Garner came home one night last
June with a batting average in the
low .200’s. The Pittsburgh Pirates’
third baseman was depressed. He
couldn’t seem to ﬁnd that hitting
groove.

Garner’s wife, Carol, a know-
ledgeable baseball wife, made a
suggestion.

“ ‘Look, you can’t reach the goals
that you set for yourself, so why not
forget the past and start your season

ow,’ ” Garner recalled his wife
saying.

“Readjust your goals,” she told
me. “I liked the suggestion. I was
ready to try anything. I wanted to
show the Pirates’ organization, the
players, that I was worth the
six-for-three deal they made to get

,7

me.

Pittsburgh, needing a third
baseman, sent pitchers Doc Medich
and Dave Giusti, along with four
ﬁne young prospects to the Oakland
A’s for Garner, an all-star second
baseman in the American League
who had been an all-star third
baseman in his minor league days.

..Garner tried hard not to make up
a long list of excuses for his early
failure with the bat. He insisted
changing leagues required only a
small adjustment. He thinks it
might have been that he came to the

deadline—and concentrated so
much on the switch from second to
third he might have neglected his
hitting.

“It was strange,” Garner said
before a spring training exhibition,
“because I was making contact with
the ball. I just wasn’t getting hits. I
couldn’t ﬁnd the holes. I was hitting
the at ’em ball.”

Garner felt that he knew some
mechanical things he wasn’t doing
right, but noted that when you’re
swinging at a 90 mile-per-hour
fastball it’s difficult to think of the
many things you should do. It has to
come naturally. And the 28-year-old
was struggling.

“I’m a goal setter,” Garner
conﬁded. “I tell myself every
season what I want to accomplish. I
was wallowing in self pity because
those goals were going down the
drain. My wife’s suggestion helped
to put all these things in their proper
perspective. The past was past. The
future was still there.”

And Garner really took advantage
of that future. Suddenly the
pressure of trying to please the
organization, the players, the fans,
disappeared in a feeling of peace
and relaxation.

“One thing I realized was that I
had a bad scouting report on
National League pitchers,” Garner
said. “I was told on a no ball, two
strike pitch all

I’d see were

fastballs. It wasn’t true. You see
just as many breaking balls in the
National League in 0-2 situations as
you do in the American. Oh, maybe
it’s a slider instead of a curve, but
it’s a breaking ball.

“I’d be standing up there waiting
for the fastball, and get stunned
with a breaking pitch,” Garner
recalled. “That’s all it takes, that
fraction of a second of indecision. I
learned the hard wav.”

Garner ﬁnished the season with a
bang. He boosted his average to
.260, hitting better than .300 from
just before the July All-Star Game
break until the end of the season.
He tied for team high with 10
triples, drove in the winning run in
seven games, hit a career high 17
homers, scored 99 runs and had 77
RBIs.

And perhaps most important,
Garner was 82 percent successful
scoring runners from third with less
than two outs (14 of 17). He stole 32
bases, and when Rennie Stennett
broke a leg in August, Garner took
over at second base in ﬁne style.

Garner said the confidence that
manager Chuck Tanner displayed
during that first half of the season
slump was a big factor. The only
time Tanner relented on Garner was
when the infielder got so discour-
aged and asked for a rest. He was

contributing nothing offensively
and felt sitting back, relaxing and
watching, might get him going
again. It worked.

Garner is enthusiastic about the
National League.

“There is more fan identity in the
National,” Garner said. “You play
in Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Phila-
delphia, St. Louis, the stadiums are
packed. Almost all the towns are
great baseball towns. The fans live
and die with their baseball. There
are more hard-fought battles, more
pride, more aggressiveness, more
running, more knockdowns. You
realize that you cannot let up, or
you’ll get beat. Maybe it’s not
relevant, but it’s more fun.”

Garner again has set his goals for
the season, but they’re a carefully
kept secret. He won’t even share
them with his wife. He believes the
NL East is the toughest division in
baseball, and that the Pirates will be
in the thick of contention.

“I can’t say that we’ll win it and
