One of America is greatest student newspapers — since 1906

VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 112

   

GB,sports dept.
holding a forum    

F J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Thousands of students attend Pitt athlet-
ics events every year.

Few, however, get the chance to inﬂu-
ence decisions about way the sporting events
are carried out — until now.

This Wednesday, at 9:30 p.m., Pitt’s ath-
letics department and Student Government
Board will lead an open forum, where stu-

dents can give their feedback to proposed ‘

changes and suggest their own ideas.

“It’s a chance for students to give us
their feedback,” said Jim Earle, Pitt’s associ-
ate athletics director for New Business and
Fan Development. “We want to make sure
they continue to have a good time.”

“It’s areal opporumityforthemtotellus
what they like and what they don’t,” added
Earle, who will lead the forum with SGB

President Brian Kelly, Board member Matt .
Hutchinson and several oﬂrer professionals

involved in coordinating athletics events,

The panel-led discussion will focus on -

several issues involving football and men’s
basketball events, including fooﬂaall tailgat-
ing, ticket prices for both sports and possible
changes aifecting student sections.

o Kelly said he will. suggest a pre—pur-
chase plan for spaces in the student parking
section at Heinz Field. While students may
have to wait several hours in line somewhere
the day before a game to buy parking pass-
es, he said, it would eliminate the need for
students to drive down to the lot early on
game days. Under the current system, stu-
dents frequently circle the lot until a’ space
opens, hoping to win a spot on the ﬁrst-
corne, ﬁrst-serve system, Kelly said.

“It would get sonre sort of certainty,”
Kelly said of the parking pass program.

The panel will also open for discussion
the idea of creating an upgrade system, by
which students could ‘pay to upgrade extra
tickets in the student section —— which
require a Pitt ID for use —— into guest tickets.

.,“It would legitimize it, where you
wouldn’t have to wony about it,” Kelly said.

He described situations in which students’
visiting friends, wanting to attend football
games, must borrow other Pitt students’ IDs.
to attempt to get into the student—only sec-
tion. If students could upgrade their tickets,
guests would be allowed into the student

section with the upgraded tickets ——_— a sit11a- F

tion that could also make Pitt seem more P
responsible for non-students’ behavior in the
Pitt section. '

The panel will also present the possibil-
ity of increasing ticket prices, both for foot-
ball and basketball games. Noting that st11-
dent season tickets to Penn State football
games cost $145, Kelly said Pitt’s student
season ticket price increased from $20 to
$25 last season. He said that a higher price
might get rid of “casual buyers,” who may

' buy a season pass at a low price and only...

attend one or two games. . . 
“We don’t want to price students out of
being able to go to games,” Kelly added,
explaining that when students buy season
tickets and do not attend the games, they pre- 1

single-game student tickets.

ACLU fighting the war for condoms in America

LUCY LEITNER
Staff Writer

An elderly man held a cane in one
hand and clutched a prepackaged dental
dam in the other as he stood three feet from
Justin Sane of the band Anti-Flag.

Drummer Pat Thetic stood outside the
door of the auditorium in Porter Hall on
Carnegie Mellon University’s campus, dis-
tributing latex contraceptives as people
exited “The Secret War on Condoms” lec-
ture last Sunday.

The day after Valentine’s Day, a four-
person panel spoke to a group of roughly
40 people about the potential dangers of

what they depicted as an evangelical carn-
paign in today’s political realm to dispute

the effectiveness of condoms in preventing ‘

pregnancy and sexually transmitted dis-
eases.

The American Civil Liberties Union
sponsored the event to expand on the theo-
ry espoused by New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof in his January 2003 arti-
cle, “The War On Condoms.” He describes
the push for abstinence-only education and
some conservative groups’ insistence on
the inadequacy of condoms as “downright
weird.”

Panel - speaker Brenda Green, vice
president for education of Plarmed

Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania,’

described the federal regulations imposed
on sex education and condom distribution.
She said “an obscene amount of tax dol-
lars” are used to fund abstinence-only edu-
cation programs, and she referred to sever-
al recent Supreme Court appointments of
anti-abortion justices, saying that they are

_also opposed to the family planning her

organization sponsors.

Green also described a report card
published every three years by a sexual
health organization in which each state is
graded from A to F based on criteria such
as gay rights, sex education and abortion
availability. Pennsylvania has never scored

higher than a D-minus, and only ranks
above the 11 states that failed. She refer-
enced the F-ranked Alabama’s policy that
made the possession of a vibrator illegal.
This policy existed until less than two
years ago. D

“If I was worried before, I’m even
more wonied now,” said CMU’s Student
Health Services Director Anita Barkin at
the end of Green’s speech. She continued

‘to give speciﬁc examples of her personal

encounters with “responsible students”
who visited her oﬂice with contraception
and sexually—transrnitted diseases. She

referred to her ofﬁce as a “safe, oonﬁden- \

tial environment,” where inquiries about
sexual health are encouraged.

Dr. Marian Michaels, associate profes-
sor of pediatrics and surgery at Pitt’s
School of Medicine and director of the

Pediatric HIV Center "at Children’s 

Hospital, described the present threat
posed by the HIV virus and the ability of
condoms, when used consistently and cor-

rectly, to prevent the transmission of the.

disease. '

“The male condom is essentially
impermeable to STDs,” she said, address-
ing the condom strength testing performed
by the. Food and Drug Administration.
Michaels presented statistics of AIDS rates
in the United States and abroad, showing
the increase of the disease in women and

minorities. Twenty percent of adults in '

sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV,
and 300 million venereal disease incidents
are reported worldwide each year, she said.

Michaels referenced the Ugandan
govemment’s ABC Program to target and
decrease AIDS in the country by encour-

aging abstinence, being faithful and con-

dom use.

“I think we should extend the Uganda
program to ‘D,’ don’t put your head in the
sand, and ‘E,’ educate yourself,” she con-
cluded. . '

The final speaker, Dr. Stephen
Thomas, director at the Center for

it Minority Health, called the insistence upon

‘abstinence-only education, “morality and
ideology trump[ing] science.”

’ He related the ﬁght for sexual freedom
to the Civil Rights Movement, and the
“war on condoms” to the Red Scare and

_ mass genocide.

The lecture was brought to a close by
a question-and-answer session moderated
by Sane, in which anonymous audience
inquiries were addressed. When the ques-
tion, “Where does abstinence-only until
marriage leave you if you’re gay and can’t

» get married?” was read, an audience mem-
, ber blurted out, “Frustrated.”

Sane concluded the event by encour-
aging audience members to become social
activists by visiting Web sites, including
www.punkvoter.com.

As the listeners left the auditorium, A

one student remarked, “I just met the
drummer from Anti-Flag. He gave me a
dental dam!”

In the LEED system, green ratings
extend beyond the buildings themselves
and look at whether or not new develop-
ment is placed on abandoned industrial sites
—— known as “brownﬁeld” sites —— whether
the materials were manufactured or gath-
ered locally, and whether the building is sit-
uated near public and alternative transporta-
tion.

PNC First Side Center, the second’

largest green building project in the world,

close to public transportation. Some of its
basic characteristics, such as the inclusion of
both stairwells and elevators, have been
designed to promote anoﬂier aspect of green
building: sociability. _

“People do not speak to each other in
elevators, but they will stop to talk to people
on the stairs,” Lowry said

Lowry also explained- how some of the
basic- characteristics of Pittsburgh geogra-
phy and historical development have kept it
green. Pittsburgh has more trees than any
other city in the country, and these trees
have even more opportlmity to grow and
release oxygen into the environment now
that the steel mills are gone. Pittsburgh is
also home to 712 sets of steps that residents
can use to scale the hillsides, a topic that one
of Pitt’s visiting professors, Robert Regan,
elaborates on in his book, “’Ihe Steps of

A Pittsburgh: Portrait of a City.” 9

But while much of our city is green,
Lowry explained that in some areas, it’s
being overrun by asphalt gray.

According to a recent report by The
Brookings Institution, between 1982 and
1997, the amount of land in the Pittsburgh
region converted to" urban uses increased by

42.6 percent, while the number of house- A

holds in the area grew by only 2.5 percent.
This amounts to about 8.5 acres of.deve1-
oped land for every new household She
explained that these sprawl problems are
particularly visible in the strip mall develop-
ments in Cranbeny Township, and that
more problems would follow if the Mon-
Fayette Expressway is built, since a high-
way would then have to run through the
Braddock area.

Pitt is contributing to the effort to keep
Pittsburgh green through its Green
Construction and Sustainable Development
Program which is part of the department of
civil and environmental engineering. The
program currently offers a number of grad-
uate and undergraduate courses in green
building and enviromnental sustainability,
several of which involve life cycle assess-
ment Robert Ries, program director and
professor of civil and enviromnental engi-
neering, explained that life cycle assessment
is a framework in which researchers study
the enviromnental consequences of a build-
ing or product from the time the necessary
raw materials are extracted through the time
of the object’s disposal. '

“It gives you an opportimity to view,
from a holistic perspective, the lifetime
effects of making a change in that product,”
Ries said “You want to make ‘sure that
change doesn’t have a negative effect

Sudden heroes of FDN Y misbehaving

After Sept. 11, 2001, New York
City firefighters became sudden
heroes. They became instant celebri-
ties in their own right- Countless
Americans sported “FDNY” hats
and pins and other apparel. ,

Recently, though, the depart-
ment’s collective halo has dimmed
in light of reports of drug use, fight-
ing and drinking. At a New Year’s
Eve party at the Staten Island fire-
house, one firefighter bashed anoth-
er in the face with a metal chair dur-
ing an alcohol-fueled brawl. Two
firefighters at an East Harlem fire-

6 house tested positive for cocaine,

and one locker at that house was
found to contain beer and liquor. A
captain and a lieutenant were spot-
ted drinking beer and allegedly per-
forming “Born to Run” in uniform at
a karaoke bar. The department put
out a beefcake calendar to raise
money for charity, and one of the
models — who is moonlighting as a
stripper —— is facing charges of
steroid use.

Without a doubt, these actions
are unsavory and, in some cases,
inexcusable. However, it’s unfair to
hold these people to a higher stan-
dard than any other person in the
public service, just because they
were publicly canonized in the wake
of a national horror.

For the most part, these are

young men, existing in a culture of
machismo, working hard and play-
ing hard. Their actions have not
been right, but they are also not
somehow more wrong than if they
had been committed by, say, the fire
department of Pittsburgh. The New
York Fire Department, by virtue of
valiantly performing their assigned
task on one of the worst days in
American history, has been perhaps
unfairly thrust under a microscope
of public opinion.

After the attacks, more than
2,300 firefighters and officers
retired. Many of them were the most
experienced and mature among the
ranks, and as such, likely played a
leadership role, not just in firefight-
ing, but in proper behavior. '

While not on duty and not in
uniform, firefighters’ actions are
their own business, within the
boundsof the law. Boozing in uni-
form is terrible. Boozing at a party
is a different story. '

Being suddenly made into
heroes after undergoing a great trau-
ma — one that took the lives of
many _fellow firefighters —— cannot
possibly be easy. No one would sug-
gest that lawbreakers or departmen-
tal policy-breakers should -be
excused. It’s not unreasonable,
though, to View the firefighters’
actions through a charitable lens.

There are any number of bold state-
ments I could make about Mel-Gibson’s
“The Passion of the Christ” based on
what I expect or want it to be, but, like
most of its ardent supporters and critics,
I haven’t seen it yet.

Were it not for the
vicious tug-of-war sur-
rounding the ﬁlrn’s Feb. 25
release, I wouldn’t even
know it was coming.

But the controversy
does exist, and it seems
somewhat inevitable based
on the nature of the cruci-
ﬁxion story itself.

The biggest concern is
that it might inspire —— or.
be interpreted as + a clash
between Christians and
Jews. .

My point will be that it shouldn’t,
because it isn’t.

What concerns me about this debate
is that so much of it opposes the Gospel
accounts themselves.‘

Arguments have been made about
the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich’s

work in constructing the ﬁlm’s violence,

and they are warranted. ‘ _

But in the end, it’s a violent story no
matter how you look at it or whom you
reference. _

If Gibson bases everything in his
movie on Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John ‘alone, we will still have a story
about a crowd of Jews calling for Jesus’
torture and death, and so we will still
have opponents to its telling.

The most vocal and persistent oppo-
sition to this film is embodied by Anti-
Defamation League National Director
Abraham H. Foxman and Rabbi Gary
Bretton-Granatoor.

In a Feb. 3 New York Daily News
column, they argue that Gibson’s. ﬁlm

will reinforce a Jewish “Christ-killer”

 

Eric Miller
Columnist

Gibson’s “Passion” depicts love, not hate

stereotype that has caused surges of
anti-Sernitism in the past: “Our concern
is that the images could be used by those
who are disposed toward hatred to hard-
en their hearts.”

Though the struggle between pure
' storytelling and potential
backlash is multi-faceted in
this case, it can pretty much
be narrowed down to one
verse, Matthew 25:27, in
which the angry mob accepts
responsibility for Christ’s
death.

It is this verse that has
been used as a justiﬁcation
for hate, and so it is this
verse that worries Jewish
leaders like Foxman.

The Gospels paint a
picture of a Jewish crowd —
governed by mob mentality and corrupt

‘authorities‘—- that chants and cheers for’

Christ’s execution. .

Opposite them we have Pontius
Pilate," a Roman governor who would
rather appease the crowd than pursue
justice.

And above all, we have Christ, who
knows and accepts that his life was for-
feit before it began.

In the January issue of Citizen mag-

- azine, Gene Edward Veith states it clear-

1y: “What Jewish critics do not under-
stand — and what anti-Semites and lib-

A eral theologians actively reject —- is that

the death of Christ, for all its horrors,
was a good thing. 5

Stars of competitive eating circuit deserve limelight

I. once ate three big Fuddruckers
cheeseburgers, a bunch of fries, and threw
back a couple of beers in one 45-minute
sitting. I thought that was a lot, but then
again, I’m not a professional.

At the end of January, before a crowd
of 20,000 in Philadelphia’s Wachovia
Center, Sonya Thomas ate 167 chicken
wings in 30 minutes to take local radio sta-
tion WIP’s Wing Bowl DGI title. Even
more amazing than that feat may be the
fact that she weighs just 105 pounds -
pre-competition weight, that is.

Thomas is currently ranked the third- pg

best competitive eater in the world by the
International Federation of Competitive

Eating, an organization that exists to give‘

those with big ——-and I do mean big —
appetites an arena to compete in.

‘ According to her IFCE proﬁle,
Thomas has built up quite a resume. She’s
eaten 23 pulled—pork sandwiches m 10
minutes. She ate seven pounds of
Turducken * that much-loved
Thanksgiving dish of a turkey stuffed ‘with
a chicken which itself is stuffed with a
duck — in 12 minutes. She’s even eaten
65 hard-boiled eggs in six _minutes, 40 sec-

'onds in a gastronomical feat that would

put»Paul.Newman’s “Cool Hand Luke”
character to shame.

This summer, I got the privilege of
seeing No. l—ranked Takeru Kobayashi
blow away the competition on Coney
Island by eating 44 and a half hotdogs in‘
12 minutes at the Nathan’s Famous Fourth
of July Hot Dog Eating Contest.
Kobayashi, who enjoys celebrity status in
his home country of Japan, actually ate 50
hotdogs in 12 minutes in the 2001 contest
to set the record, and has also eaten 20
pounds of rice balls in 30 minutes. At 132

pounds, he’s one»in a string of petite_ '

Japanese champions who’ve dominated

' the Nathan’s event — competitive eating’s

version of the Westminster Dog Show —
since Japanese no'odle—e_atir_1g champion

Hirofumi Nakajima roared across the "V

Paciﬁc in the ‘90s to amaze crowds with
huge feats of probably-unhealthy mass
consumption, “Saturday Night Live”
Coneheads—style. .

The IFCE could put many other

sports to shame with its worldwide fan fo1- ‘ 4

lowing of sponsored events; champi-
onships; records; system tracking
the world’s top competitive eaters; and mi
almost ‘mythological history and code of
honor that lends the’ exploits of the best
eaters the heroic air of giants suiding the
earth with silverware in their hands.

Now, most people in the world proba-
bly wouldn’t want — let alone be able —
to stuff that much food into themselves so
quickly. It’s different on the eating circuit.
The IFCE makes_it clear in its safety stan-
dards that such speed‘ eating “is only suit-

’ able for those 18 years of age or older and

only in a °controlled environment with
appropriate rules and with an emergency
medical technician present.” The greatest

shame for a competitor is to
throw up during or following
an event, which is the profes-
sional equivalent of a samurai
losing face to his peers.
Aside ﬁom the obvious
moral questions about a
“sport” so blatantly abusing
the human ability to eat, espe-
cially when there are so many
genuinely hungry people in
the world, the appeal of such
a competition stacked up

The majority of the
world’s population has the
ability to eat, so the develop-
ment pool for the sport is

sports. From a young age,
American kids go through

' same percentage of the population that can

throw a football as hard and as accurately

as Brett Favre or Dan Marino.

Let’s be honest, as the richest and
most obese nation on Earth, we should be
dominating this. Putting such record hold-
ers as Crazy Legs Conti (3 and a half
pounds of pancakes and bacon in 12 min-
utes) and Donald Lerman (seven‘qua1ter—
pound sticks of salted butter in ﬁve min-

Judge gospel accounts on reasonable terms

Miller, page 1

‘The Passion of the Christ,’ is that
blame of every kind is removed.”

At the root of this debate is not
Gibson’s technique, but the question of
whether or not Jews killed Jesus, and
what the answer means for us today.

On the surface of the story, yes, a
group of them did.

We are given a picture in which a
Jewish mob pushes Roman authorities
into an execution toward which they are
indifferent.

But digging deeper, the Gospels
consistently present Christ as one who is

destined to die in this manner, and who
accepts his fate, knowing it is above and
beyond any human intervention.

We are told that the events of the I

ﬁrst Good Friday were allowed and
directed by God, and so it makes no
sense to hold contemporary Jews
accountable for something a select few
of their ancestors did while operating
within God’s will.

And therefore, it is not right to omit
specific points of scripture —— Mattew
27:25, for instance —— just to pander to
those with misconceptions. v ~

When considered holistically, the

story of Christ’s cruciﬁxion is loaded

with meaning and deﬁned by complex
interactions between men and God.

To Whittle it down to anti-Semitism
is to completely miss the point, and no
one can soundly use it as a justification
for hate.

When this idea is embraced by
Gibson’s critics and those they worry
about, the Gospel accounts might be
judged -on reasonable terms. r

In the meanwhile, let’s not shred
scripture simply because some people
might not get it.

The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from
the Life of Robert S. McNamara
Starring: Robert S. McNamara

Directed by: Errol Morris
iikikﬁk

Errol Morris’s documentary, “The Fog of War,”
presents a candid and emotional account of one
man’s involvement in major events of the 20th cen-
tury.

Robert S. McNamara, secretary of Defense
under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations,
reveals the rationale behind decisions regarding
the World War II Japanese firebombings, the
Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. Morris
divides the film into 11 lessons McNamara learned
throughout his controversial career, from
“Empathize with your enemy” to “You can’t
change human nature.”

In retrospect, McNamara admits that he made
mistakes. But when immersed in the fog of war, the
situation is “beyond the ability of the human mind
to comprehend all the variables.” As decades of
headlines denouncing his actions roll by,

<~§McNamara declares that the critics accusing him of

 

duplicity are wrong —— he tried to serve the presi-
dent and avoid nuclear war.

When McNamara was out of the political
sphere, he became director, and later president, of
the Ford Motor Company. The loss of lives to car

accidents was a problem McNamara addressed
with experimentation, such as dropping human
skulls down several flights of stairs with various
forms of padding. The image of skulls shattering in
slow motion on cement ﬂoors is eerie, but
McNamara calmly informs us that it was necessary
to save lives. It is with the same calculated mental-
ity that he justifies his actions throughout his life:
“In order to do good, you may have to engage in
evil.” ‘

Morris’ interviews with McNamara are shot
with the aid of Morris’ invention, the Interrotron.
The device sits just above the lens of the camera,
projecting Morris’ image as he interrogates the
subject. McNamara is forced to stare almost direct-
ly into the camera, resulting in eye contact with the
audience and the increased sense of maintaining a
direct conversation with the interviewee.

Although interview segments are shot in the
“talking heads” format, Morris frequently cuts
mid-sentence to tighten the statements and add’ an

edge of urgency. McNamara is seldom dead center,-

and the varied distarices and angles avert the possi-
bility of a tired image. Philip Glass’ haunting, fore-
boding score intensifies the occasionally tearful
recollections and observations of the man critics
called an arrogant dictator.

Wartime archival footage blends into
McNamara’s interviews, presenting brutal reality
alongside stark confessions. The most poignant

moment falls under Lesson N o. 5, “Proportionality
should be a guideline of war.” Months before the
nuclear bombing of Japan, McNamara was
involved in the firebombing of 67 Japanese cities.-
As we’re carried over the smoking aftermath, each
city’s percentage of destruction is compared to an
American city of comparable size. The statistics
fly by (Philadelphia, 54%; Chicago, 42%), finally
moving too fast to process.

McNamara’s inability to discuss the issue, Morris
effectively reveals the human behind the contro-

JUSTIN ROBINSON/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

~Katie Histed attempts a layup during

Pitt’s loss to Georgetown. Histed led
the Panthers with 13 points.

. RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
entered Saturday afternoon’s game
against Georgetown hoping to avoid
dropping its’ eighth straight contest.

' Things got off to a rocky, start for
the Panthers as Georgetown guard Mary
Lisicky hit two consecutive three—point-
ers, which put her past the 200 mark for
her career and helped her team get off to

‘ an 8-0 start. «

Despite trailing by as many as 12
points in the first half, the Panthers were
able to take advantage of a few scoring

5- fopportunities to make things close.

Late in the first half, freshman
guard Brooke Hughes and sophomore
guard Katie Histed each hit key three-
pointers. After that, Histed hit two free
throws to bring the Panthers within four
wifh only 2:51 remaining in the half.

3 But the momentum was short-lived,
as ‘Georgetown was able to bring its
lead back to nine by the end of the first
half’, and took a 34-25 lead into the

break. -

Pitt was able to come within four
points several times in the second half,
but never got closer. After a 10-0

Georgetown run with 12:59 left, the

Hoyas never looked back and won by
the score of 72-61. ‘

Histed, who was making her first
career start for the Panthers, led the
team in scoring with 13 points. '

“It was great to ﬁnally start,” Histed
said. “I just tried to take it like any other
game, like -I was coming out off the
bench.” A _

g 1 After the game, Head Coach Agnus
Berenato said that she would continue

to look at the positive things the team‘

has been able to accomplish.

“This could’ve been a 30-point
game, but it wasn’t,” Berenato said. “I
think what hurts is the mentality, and
that’s going to develop in time.”

The Panthers (6-16, 2-10) were able
to improve in a number of key areas.
They won the turnover battle by com-
mitting two fewer than Georgetown.

Missed opportunities contribute to loss

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketballteam
had a comeback within its grasp on
several occasions, but the Panthers
always seemed to let the opportunity
slip away. '

Pitt found itself down by four
points twice in the game after allow-
ing the Georgetown Hoyas to open a
14-4 lead in the first half. But when
the Panthers had opportunities to
obtain a_ lead, they found their shots
falling everywhere but through the
basket during their 72-61 loss \l',O
Georgetown on Saturday.

“I felt like we had a great oppor-
tunity to’ go from four to three or two
or one [point deficits], perhaps.
However, I think it’s [our] mentality,”
head coach Agnus Berenato said. _

The first time the Panthers
appeared to gain some momentum
was late in the first half with Pitt
trailing 25-15.

Freshman guard Brooke Hughes
started the Pitt run with a long three-
pointer. Georgetown responded by
hitting a long basket in front of the

arc, but Pitt ran the court and‘ Katie‘

Histed knocked down another three-

I pointer, making the score 27-21.

. Pitt regained possession and

Histed was fouled when she drove the
lane. ‘She connected on both of her
free throws, cutting the Georgetown
lead to four points with 2:51 remain-
ing in the half.
j The Panthers werelooking at the
possibility of taking. the lead before
the half, but the ‘Hoyas went on a run
to make their halftime lead 34-25.

Pitt was able to cut the lead a sec-
ond time, right after the half. Histed
opened up the half with" her third
three—pointer of the day to make the
score 34-28.

Georgetown would score two
more buckets before. the‘ Panthers
made a run. .

Forward _LaToya Kincaid hit two
consecutive layups to cut the Hoyas’

‘lead to six points.

Histed, who led Pitt with 13
points, followed on a fast break in
which she drove through the paint
and hit a layup to make the score 38-
34. The Hoyas bounced back and
extended their lead back to s’ with

two free throws, but Pitt forward
Sheila Stufﬂet hit on a layup to bring
the Panthers back to within four
points. .

With the lead within their grasps,
the Panthers again allowed the Hoyas
to make a run — a run that would seal
Pitt’s fate for the game.

“I think what hurt us was [our]
mentality,” Berenato said. “My staff,
[and I], that have to do a better job of
convincing our team to put the shot
down when you have it.”

Berenato spoke of the time when
the- Panthers were down by four
points and had the ball in their pos-
session. Pitt had severalopen looks at
the basket, but chose poor shots or
passes, allowing Georgetown to _run
the other way.» The choice of poor
shots showed on the stats sheets in the
end. Pitt shot only 34.4 percent from
the ﬂoor, whereas Georgetown con-
nected on 55.6 percent of its shots.

“There were a couple of posses-
sions when [Georgetown’s lead] was
four and either team could have broke
it open,” Berenato said. “Georgetown
broke it open because they’re a veter-
an team.”

Acquiring
Rodriguez was

later. That’s just what the Yankees
need —— another All-Star.

Current Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter will remain at his position and
A-Rod will move over to third base
to replace Aaron Boone. Boone tore
his ACL in a pick—up basketball game
a few weeks ago.

A—Rod is doing the right thing by
moving to third and not causing con-
troversy. He is demonstrating that he
is a team player and is willing to do
whatever it takes to win and hopeful-
ly he will continue with that attitude.

As I am a Baltimore Orioles’ fan,
this deal hurts, but after contemplat-

step I back and applaud Mr.
Steinbrenner. You deserve my seal of
approval, because I said that the
Boston Red Sox should have traded
outfielder Manny Ramirez for A-
Rod, but kept Nomar Garciaparra and
had him or A-Rod switch to second
base» — preferably A-Rod, since
Garciaparra already owns the posi-
tion. Then if Boston was unable to

retain Garciaparra at the end of this

season, it would still have an All-Star
shortstop to fall back on.

But I guess the light bulb didn’t
click on for Theo Epstein and the Red
Sox to try to have both players on the
team. For whatever reason, they
thought that getting rid of both
Garciaparra and Ramirez was the

ALAN SMODIC
Staff Writer

The Pitt Wrestling team won
eight out of 10 matches as the recipe
for their fifth Eastern Wrestling
League victory with a 37-7 win over
the Lock Haven Bald Eagles at the
Fitzgerald Field House Friday night.

Pitt improved to 8-5 overall and

. 5-1 in the EWL while Lock Haven

fell to 3-9 and 0-5. The Panthers won
four out of the first five bouts of the
night. Drew Headlee opened the meet
with a victory and Pitt rolled from
there.

p Other Panther victories included
a technical fall A from Ronald
Tarquinio, a pin by Zach Doll, major
decisions from Josh Birt and Francis
Iorfido, and a forfeit for Matt
Kocher.

“We wrestled hard, I thought..

That’s what we try to pride ourselves
on,” head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “Just staying focused and
wrestling hard.”

In Head1ee’s bout, he used a
reversal in the third period and two
near-fall points to ‘lock up a 7-2 win
over Lock Haven’s Jim Collins.

“Headlee always gets us started.
He creates momentum no matter
what,” Stottlemyer said.

Mike Ciotti continued Pitt’s
momentum with a 9-4 decision at 133
pounds and Tarquinio - picked up a
technical fall win over Lock Haven’s
James Barnes at the 5:57 mark of the
third period in the 14-1 pound weight

class. The win improved Tarquinio’s 4

record to 21-10 on the year. .

Lock Haven’s 1lth—ranked
wrestler Mike Maney had been bat-
tling the ﬂu this week and decided to
forfeit at 149 pounds to Pitt’s
Kocher, who won his team-leading
27th match of the year. '

“[I’m a] little disappointed at 149
because I really wanted to see him
wrestle,” Stottlemyer said about the
forfeit. “It would have been nice to

see what Kocher could do with him.”'

The Bald Eagles earned their first
three points of the match at 157
pounds when Charlie Brenne-man
pulled out a 5-2 decision over Pitt’s
Justin Nestor. It was the second time
this season ‘Nestor has lost to
Brenneman. - 1 .

At 165 pounds, Doll notched an
unusual finish by pinning his oppo-
nent from the defensive position,
beating Jason Gilligan of the Bald
Eagles with just 17 seconds remain-
ing in the bout. 1 _

“One of two things was going ,to
happen,” Stottlemyer said. “He
[Doll] was either going to reverse
him or pin him. Zach had a great
takedown defense. It was tremen-

dous. It contained my three points:
hustle, creativity and a never-say-die
attitude.”

With Pitt leading 23-3, Iorfido

' lengthened his EWL dual meet win-

ning streak to six when he recorded a
major decision over Ryan Summers

’ of the Bald Eagles.

The Panthers and the Bald Eagles
exchanged major decisions in the 184
and 197 pound matches. Pitt fresh-
man Eric Cassidy took the loss at 184

and ‘Birt defeated Lock Haven’s’

Carlos Ponce.

In the heavyweight bout, Pitt’s»

Travis Shirley won by injury default

Panthers dominate in 37-7 victory

over Steve Itterly at the 1:07 mark
after a takedown injured Itterly’s
knee.

The Panthers finish the dual meet
season on Feb. 19 at Fitzgerald Field
House with a match against
Edinboro. Edinboro, is unbeaten in
the EWL and tied for first with West
Virginia. The meet begins at 7:30
p.m.
“They have a nice team with guys
who are ranked pretty high. Some
guys in the top three or four at their
weight,” said Stottlemyer. ‘fI’m glad
we’re at home, though. Hopefully
we’ll get a good crowd.”

Pitt was also able to out-rebound the
Hoyas 39-34.

The biggest difference in the game,
however, was shooting accuracy. Pitt
shot a meager 34 percent from the ﬁeld,
while Georgetown was able to shoot 56
percent.

The skid continues for Pitt.
Berenato said that she would continue

- with the learning process. She has not

given up hope on her team, and said that
she will not use wins and losses as a
way to gauge the team’s progress.

A “We keep teaching and they keep learn-

ing,” Berenato said. “And I think any
time you can learn, .that’s really excit-
ing. And so if ‘I didn’t have any hope,
then I would be depressed, because I
need hope. But something happened
today with 2:01 to go on the clock. We
had a kid step up and say something that
I. have been trying to get said forthe
whole year. That is a huge victory for
me. I just keep looking at all the vict_o—
ries we’re having.” _

Histed echoed Berenato’s positive
attitude, commenting on the importance
of looking at the small victories.

“We’ll come in Monday and coach
[Berenato] will have gone over film,”
Histed said. “And she’ll point out some-
thing that we haven’t done all year, or

one victory, like out-rebounding them, .

and that’s great. [Georgetown is] a great
rebounding team.” ‘

The Panthers will travel to the
Hartford Civic Center tonight to take on
two—time defending national champion
Connecticut. Tip-off is set for 7 p.mr.
Although Pitt has lost the past 16 games
in a row to the Huskies, Berenato said
that her team is looking forward to the

challenge.

“I’m really excited,” Berenato said.
“I know: [people] probably think that
I’m on drugs, but I am undoubtedly
excited for this. I believe that on any
given day, anything can happen. We
can’t prepare for Connecticut; we have
to get better for Pitt. Our team will be
excited for" it. It’ll be a great challenge,

' we won’t back down.”

Boston Red Sox curse continues

 Nocks, page 11”

answer. -

Boston was also/hopping to pick
up Chicago White Sox outfielder
Magglio Ordonez in the process. Well

Mr. Steinbrenner, it pains me to give .

you credit, but congratulations for
having a brain and not being cheap. '
A Now‘ New York will go on to win
another American League East pen-
nant as long as its new acquisitions
stay healthy. The Yankees now have

the ability to score a ridiculous num- _

ber of runs every night, and there was
talk on Sports Center Monday mom-
ing that this team may rival the
Yankees’ 1931 squad that scored
more than 1,000 runs in a season.

I just cannot fathom how the Red
Sox are consistently their own worst
enemy. Unfortunately for Red Sox
fans, the curse will continue. This
time it is. as the result of losing the
best player in the game of a different
era that wears No. 3 on his -back;

Baseball legend Babe Ruth, who
also donned No. 3, was sold to the
Yankees after the Red Sox won the
1918 World Series. Ever since the
sale,‘ Boston has failed to win a
crown. This has got to be devastating.
In both of these instances, the errors
that worked out in the Yankees’ favor
concerned money.

The Red Sox were unable to get

this deal done" back in December, and
there was just a gut feeling that
Steinbrenner would swoop in with his
money.-I wrote a column as a sopho-
more that bashed Steinbrenner for
buying his championships.

Well that was at age 19, and now,
as'I prepare to turn 22 next month, I
guess I have matured and I actually

am notmad at Steinbrenner. I actual- .

ly admire what he did to make sure
that his team came out on top.

Before this deal was made, the
talk was that the Toronto Blue Jays,
Orioles, and Red Sox were going to
make a serious run at wrestling away
control of the A.L. East, but that
seems almost impossible now.

But I’m not too upset because my
Orioles realistically only had a shot at
the AL; Wild Card spot this season. I
just feel bad for the Red Sox because
they always seem to get a raw deal.

Hopefully Boston’s strong pitch-
ing additions will pull it through,
because it will not be able to out-slug
New York this season. Maybe in the

,future Boston will learn to spend the
' money in order to ensure that it has

the best product onthe field.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports
editor for The Pitt News and wants to
make it clear that he still hates the
Yankees, but Jrespects Mr.
Steinbrenner’s smart acquisition.
