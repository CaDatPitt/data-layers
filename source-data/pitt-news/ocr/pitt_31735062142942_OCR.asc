Deans Launch

l)rive to Curb

Bad Manners

A three-pronged drive on‘ the
part of the offices of the deans of
men and women to curb “undig-
niﬁed” conduct‘ on campus was
begun last week with individual
letters to all students and a list of

special orders to William Daufen-
bach’s corps of marshal.ls.

The usual regulations concern-
ing smokers, removal of hats,
gambling, and organization pub-
licity must be enforced, accord-
ing to the new directive.

Expecting spring and spring-
time actions on the part of stu-
dents, a special request to curb
“too affectionate behavior by men
and women students” on the cam-
pus lawnswas made.

Lying On Lawn Is Out

Students are as-ked_to maintain
the dignity of the University 'by
standin-g or sitting on the cathed-
ral lawn. Speciﬁc orders for the
marshalls stated “Students are
expected to stand or sit, but not
lie down on the lawn.”

A corroborating statement ap-
peared in the letter mailed to all
women students by Dean Helen
P. Rush. She explained, “Another
. . is the tendency. of
some students to embarrass others
by too personal a relationship
with men in public. Now that
spring is upon us, thisimay be
carried to the lawn. Here again
we must count on the good taste
and cooperation of every student.”

Lockers Pilfered,

' Other orders listed ’a closer
watch on student actions in the
locker ' rooms. Reported locker
thefts necessitated the ruling. Ex-
cessive noise and rowdyism were
tabooed in the deans’ requests.

In the introductory remark pre-
facing the marshall rules, Dean
of Men T. W. Biddle wrote; “If
all who entered the Cathedral
displayed common courtesy and
goodbreeding in all their actions,
there would be no needfor rules
or for‘ marshalls.‘ Since this/is no
Utopia, thereare rules, and you,
as a marshall, must see that they

New rulings from the oﬂices of the deans received, con-
siderable comment in Pittsburgh papers over the weekend. From
the method of approach that both Miss Rush and Mr. Biddle
took on the subject,‘ publicity for their actions was not a goal.

The publicity, however, should aid rather than hinder the
ﬁnal aims of the program. It has made Pitft people, on and off
campus, conscious of the students’ behavior.‘ The past year has
proved that al downtrend in simple etiquette‘ exists. Perhaps a
public and private notice of a program to correct will provide
the shot in the arm. . ,

At ﬁrst glance, the letter mailed from Miss Rush’s office
and the one to be mailed from Mr. Biddle’s eighth ﬂoorrooms
this week brings a bit of shocked laughter. “To think that a
concerted drive of this sort would be necessary,” or, “Who’s
business is it, anyway?” 1 ‘

We gathered, on the second reading, that they asked the
question: “Have you read Emily Post recently?” in an un-
University-like and not-so-subtle manner.

A c-Sp/tiny. .-gucce/let
Pitt’.s hot and cold’Spring Festival came to a heated close
Saturday when Hunt Armory bulged with cheering, foot-sore

_ students. In overall aspect, the Festival was a success.

The 2000 attendance registered at Tuesday evening’s

‘carnival and the conservative estimate of arecord breaking

6000 dancers Saturday is proof of the success statement.

- The dance is a particular inducement, to committees of the
future to bring a, big name on campus to get a big turnout. It
stands as proof to all concerned that the University enrolls‘
urbanites with'urban attitudes: “It’s either great or it’s no

 good at all.”

More than anything, it proves that a deserving vote o(f
thanks should go to Zeurner, Griewahn, Steinlauf, Zeﬂiro, and
on down to the little people who drew cartoons, created decora-
tions, nailed booths ‘together for the carnival, and more.

M2 c° 3/¢ma¢'
Chuckle of the week occurred Saturday night in the powder
room of an “after the Festival” rendezvous.~ A little Tech girl

remarked, “Wasn’t that a lousy dance; it just proves that all,

Pitt has is school spirit.”
Wow!

The troubled vet who gets shuﬂled up to the 30th floor of the
Cathedral may not be able to dump his problems out the window,

_ The Veterans Administration Guidance center in 3017 C1. has
been solving knotty problems for ex-GI’s since the office was first
set up at Pitt in 1944. The Center functions under the VA in con-

is not limited to students veterans
in its scope. Over half of those
served by the staff are non-stu-
dents, coming from all parts of
Western Pennsylvania.

Chief of the Guidance center is
Howard D. Blank, who is assist-
ed by Dr. Omar C. Held, director
of the University’s guidance serv-
ice. The staff consists of ﬁve ap-
praisers, four p-sychometer spe-
cialists‘and examiners, two Uni-
versity clerks, two VA clerks, and
a vocational advisor.

Persons referred to the Center
from other Veterans agencies and
by personal application are given
a six—hour interview which in-
cludes tests for interests, intelli-
gence, and aptitude, differing from
similar tests given to servicemen
in that they are administered on
an individual, personalized level.
An intensive study of the appli-
cant’s' background is made, and
results of all the observations are
cﬁom.-bined in forming a case rec-
ord froin which conclusions can
be drawn concerning the vet’s in-
dividual problems.

Advice based on these conclu-
sions is given on a completely op-
tional basis; the vet can take it
or leave it. More often than not

Mr. Blank urged Pitt veterans
to check on their grades now if
they are having scholastic diffi-
culties. “Any vet who feels he is
not doing satisfactory work should
be sure to contact us so that he
may be properly advised before

Four Panthers Finish
Season Over .300 Mark 1

That the Pitt baseball team was a hitting club is a fact borne

out by one glance at the individual batting averages.

The Mitter-

ling gang boasted four players with averages of .300 or over.
Rightﬁelder Johnny Wascieko, a stocky little ex-catcher, carried

the big bat with a healthy .415 percentage. Wascieko, who was both

a, catcher and inﬁelder on last year’s squad, was switched to the

outgardens this season.

9 Although he was

no Terry
Moore at ﬂagging down ﬂyballs,
he hit and ﬁelded well enough to
please Coach Mitterling. Wascieko
was also team captain.

Jackie Snyder, a rookie, belted
a res-lpectarble .360 while holding
down the shortstop post. Third-
baseman Dodo Canterna compiled
a .356 mark and led the team in
runs batted in.

Leftﬁelder Johnny~ Gennock
proved a consistent lead-off man
by batting an even .300.

Second baseman Art Barnes,
who led the team in hitting last
year, went into a slump and found
himself with a meager .137 aver-
age. Barnes had just begun to hit
in the closing games of the sea-
son. 1

Jack Smodic, also one of last
season’s power punchers, hit, a
mild .208.

Here are the batting averages of the
regulars: ‘
