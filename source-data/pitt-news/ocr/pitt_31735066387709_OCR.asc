Pitt band will accompany team to bowl

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

It has been officially an-
nounced that the University of
Pittsburgh Marching Band will be
accompanying the football team

to the Bluebonnet Bowl in‘

Houston.

According to Pitt's Associate
Athletic Director Dean Billick,
”From the beginning, ‘we want-

ed to take the band along for the

'bowl game. It was a budgetary

decision. We had to evaluate
some financial considerations,
suchas the cost of transportation
and housing. We put the budget

together. Until then, we couldn't

make a decision.” . ~

”I know that the members of
the band are very happy and
pleased. Several of them have ap-
proached Athletic Director Dr.

Bozik to offer their thanks.” said
Billick. _

In the past, the band has usual-
ly accompanied the football team
to bowl games.

Billick said the band accom-
panying the team became a big-
ger issue than it was. Although
many‘ band members and stu-
dents signed a petition so as to as-
sist the band to travel, he said that
was never a factor. ”It was mere-

ly a budgetary decision,” said
Billick. ’ '
Billick declined to disclose the

cost for the band to attend the
bowl game.

Pitt received a formal invitation
to the Bluebonnet Bowl follow-

‘ ing the Kent State game on Nov. _

21. The bowl game will be held
in the Houston Astrodome on
Dec. 31.

Cuban
inmates

release

hostages  

. By Guy Coates

Associated Press Writer

OAKDALE, La. — Cuban in-
mates Sunday threw down their
weapons and released the 26,

hostages they had held for eight
days at a burned-out federal pri— '
son after a Cuban-born bishop‘

urged them to accepta govern
ment agreement. *

At the riot—torn Atlanta federal‘

penitentiary, Cuban inmates
released four of their hostages
early Sunday, leaving 90 people
still captive.

The freed hostages, some of
them_grinning broadly, walked
from the Federal
Center near Oakdale at 2:25 pm.

a After releasing the hostages,
some of the 950 Cuban inmates
threw their homemade knives, ’

clubs, hammers and boardsstud-
ded with nails into a pile in the‘
yard of the detention center.‘
Cubans seized control of the fa-
cility on Nov. 21 and the federal

penitentiary in Atlanta two days-

later during riots sparked by a
government announcement that
many inmates would be returned
to Cuba. ‘

The inmates demanded that
they be allowed to remain in the‘
United States. Federal officials
have said they would delay any
deportations until the Cubans’
cases could be reviewed in-
dividually.

The rioting left one person
dead, 53 people injured and the
prisons badly damaged by fires
and looting. ‘

About a half an hour after the
hostages were released, four

representatives of the inmates _

signed the ‘agreement with the
government. The signing was wit-
nessed, at the inmates’ insistence,
by Auxiliary Bishop Agustin Ro-
man of Miami's Roman Catholic
archdiocese.

J.D. Williams, a regional direc-

tor of the federal Bureau of Pri- '

sons who was the government's
chief negotiator, refused to reveal
details of the agreement, saying
it might jeopardize negotiations
with Cubans in Atlanta.

”We did not give away the ‘

store,” Williams said. ”I think it's
a good agreement. It's an agree-
ment we all can live with. We got
an amenable agreement.”

The agreement followed a_.‘a _.
videotaped appeal, by Roman,“ '
’ who urged the Cubans to release ‘  
their hostages and sign thepact  3

Lawmakers begi

WASHINGTON — Congres-
sional bargainers took four gruel-
ing weeks to fashion a $76
billion, two-year, deficit-
reduction pact with the Reagan
administration. And that is just
the beginning.

Lawmakers returning from their
week-long Thanksgiving recess
now must chisel into law the de-
tails of the agreement — whose
taxes will be increased, which
programs will be slashed — and
aEo enact federal spending bills

‘ for the year.

Their goal is to complete the
task in about three weeks, in time
for Christmas week. To accom-
plish so much in what for Con-
gress is so little time, legislative
leaders will have to get rare lev-
els of obedience from House and
Senate members.

”This isn't the early 1960s any--

more, when you had [House
Speaker] Sam Rayburn and
[Senate Majority Leader] Lyndon
Johnson running the House and
Senate, and there was an iron-
fisted rule over what members
did,” said Stanley E. Collender, a
budget specialist with Touche

Ross and Co., a Washington ac-
counting firm. ”Members are in-
creasingly independent, es-
-pecially subcommittee chairmen,
who we're counting on to imple-
ment a deal.”

Cartoonist Schulz is
now multimillionaire

SANTA ROSA, Calif. — Charles
Schulz’s earnings as creator of a
cartoon-strip empire aren't exact-

Schulz, according to Forbes
magazine, earned an estimated

- $30 million last "year and is ex-

pected to earn $30 million this
year, putting him among the

tertainers as Bruce Springsteen,
Bill Cosby and Sylvester Stallone.

A constant source of income
has been the ”Peanuts” comic
strip, which-» first appeared in
seven newspapers on Oct. 2,
1950. But Schulz’s biggest bread-
winners are the licensing and
merchandising fees from Snoopy
and other ”Peanuts” characters,
which appeared on nearly $1 bil-

Happy Hour at Hillman

Hillman Lirary en more t

By Keri D. Smith

For The Pitt News

There are quite a number of
places for students to hang out in
Oakland. There's the ”O”, Zel-
da's and the William Pitt Union,
just to name a few.

And then there's Hillman
Library.

Oftentimes — under the guise
of intense study, of course — stu-
dents have been known to do just
a little more than note-taking be-
tween the bookcases.

Anyone who’s been there
knows students begin to con-
gregate on the ground floor to the
left of the elevators.

”lt’s the ground floor and the
first floor, basically. Unless you're
copying notes, you don't get
much done,” said Katrin Soto, a
Pitt student who said she tries to
study at Hillman. The reason she
and her friends go to Hillman is

to study together for their politi-

cal science class.

Allan Bell and his friends study
together for a class, too. ”The
ground floor is really social,” said
Bell. ”The higher up [you go], the
more studying [there is].”

Some people prefer to study

alone, which is why individual

cubicles have been placed
throughout the library.

,_In addition to the sounds of an
occasional ”Shhh” and the turn-

Ourlcampus library — a place for studying or socializing? It appears as if the answer is both.

ing of pages, a student at Hillman
is just as likely to hear jots of gos-
sip and flirtation!

Lara Chensny said she thinks a
library's sole purpose is to be a
place of study. ’’I usually go over
to the Law Library. It's quieter
over there’. I'm meeting someone

here tonight.”

If, by chance, someone un-P

familiar with Pitt asked what
Hillman is, it would be interest-
ing to hear the responses. ”That’s
where everyone goes,” said
Maureen O'Connor. ”A good
friend of mine goes to the first

floor when she wants to see
someone.”

What is the big attraction at
Hillman, though? ”We come to
the library because we know we
can talk here,” said Andy Alex-
ander, who studies with Joe Sale-_
mi. ’’I havn’t noticed [any

looking for quiet, I go to the Pub-_

students were sitting on the first
floor before a table of open
books. ’’If there is increasing

Jerome Lane battles Willie Molson (No.25) for_a rebound.

By John Enright

Editor in Chief

Pitt's freshmen finally decided
to let senior Charles Smith join in
their game, and that made the
difference in the Panthers’ 96-70
season-opening win over Robert
Morris before 6,695 fans at Fitz-
gerald Field House Saturday
night.

Smith scored Pitt's first three
points of the game on a jumper
and a foul shot but was silent for
the remainder of the first half. He
attempted only three shots in the
half. ’ ' _

With Smith relatively silent,
Robert Morris came back from a
29-20 deficit and went into the
locker room at halftime down by
only three points, 37-34.

”We’re not going to win too
many games with Smith getting
only three shots in the first half,”
said Pitt coach Paul Evans, who
had a few choice words for his
squad at halftime."

Pitt's four freshmen each
played at least eight minutes in

the first half. During a four minute _

PlTl' HOOPS, Monday, November 30, I987

span late in the half, all four fresh-
men were on the court with
Smith.

Porter, Matthews and Miller
foresook Smith's presence on the
floor and fired up jumpshots in-
stead. The three combined for
nine, three-point attempts in the
half. Miller, who finished the

game with 13 points and 10 as-

sists, made two three—pointers.

Smith became so frustrated he
even fired up a three-point shot
midway through the half.

”The problem in the first half
was that [everyone] was trying to
score. Darelle [Porter] and Jason
[Matthews] were trying to score.
They had the free, open jump
shot, but they didn't know when
we start off a game, to get a lead,
you start inside and [work out].
They didn't know that,” said
Smith. L

”At the half, ltold them, ’We
have to start the second half
working inside-out and build a
lead. Then they'll collapse on me
orJerome [Lane], and you'll have
an open jump shot.’ They didn't

[know that _in the first half and

were trying to live off the jump ,

shot,” added Smith.

Besides getting the ball to
Smith, Evans wanted his team to
pick up the tempo in the second
half. He had Pitt apply full-court
pressure, with Smith guarding the
inbounds man.

The Panthers forced five
second-half Robert Morris turn-
overs in the pressure defense and
quickly blew open what was
once a close game.

Smith scored Pitt's first six
points of the half as the Panthers
went on an 18-2.run to increase

_its lead to 19 points, 55-36.

Robert Morris never got closer
than 14 points the rest of the
game.

Smith had 19 second-half
points. He finished the game with
23 points, 14 rebounds and
seven blocked shots.

Matthews added 15 points for

Pitt, which is rated fourth by The

Associated Press.
Robert Morris was led by for-
ward Willie Molson with 20
points.
”When I play up front [in full-

court pressure], I can really get af-
ter it if I'm not tired. Tonight
[Saturday night], I wasn't tired. I
can really put some pressure on
the other team,” said Smith.
Pitt forward Demetreus Gore,
who scored 20 points despite his
sore ankle, said the Panthers were
able to open up the game be-

”much better in the second half.”

”Charles puts a lot of'pressure
on the inbounds man, and it's
hard for him to see over Charles.
Our guards did a good jobalso,”
said Gore. A 3

Robert Morris coach Jarrett
Durham said he was disappoint-
ed with his team's failure to han-
dle Pitt's pressure in the second
half. But he also didn't have any-
body to handle Smith.

”In the second half, Smith got
going early, and there was no
stopping him. [Our team] thought
they played well for 20 mintues,
but you have to play well for 40

Brookin’s should

By Jim Urban

Freshmen. Injuries. Acid in-
digestion.

Some coaches say the three go
hand—in—hand. Pitt coach Paul
Evans is getting to know the
feeling.

Last week, Evans lost starting
forward Rod Brookin for a month
to a shoulder separation.

Evans has also watched senior
Demetreus Gore hobble around
with a gimpy ankle he injured pri-
or to fall practice.

Gore missed the first two
weeks of practice and has seen
limited practice time since.

”We’re beaten up,” Evans said
last week. ’’It has been a rough
preseason injury—wise.’’ .

Brookin, a 6-foot-5 sophomore
from Steelton, Pa., was Pitt's most
efficient player off the bench last

season, averaging 10.2 points per

game and four rebounds.

”The doctors think it will be a
month,” Evans said of Brookin’s
absence fromthe lineup. ”Rod
thinks it will be a little quicker,
and I hope he's right. We really
need him. The experience the
younger players will get is great,
but we need the outside shooting
and some other things Rod does
well.”

Gore, the 6-5 senior from
Detroit, was slated to move back

to off—guard this season after

spending last year at small for-
ward. He averaged 16.1 points
per game from the off-guard po-
sition as a sophomore.

   

Although Gore scored 20
points in Pitt's 96-70 win over
Robert Morris Saturday night,
Evans said he thinks Gore will not
be fully recovered until January.

Against Robert Morris, Gore
was noticeably favoring the leg
and played only 19 minutes.

”He can go one day hard, and
then he is no good at all the next
day,” Evans said.

A team can react different ways
to a rash of injuries, according to
Evans. He said he is keeping a
low profile on the situation and
hopes the players do also.

”The way you react is the way

they are going to react,” he said."

Several freshman have been
forced into action a little quicker
than expected because of the in-
juries.

Jason Matthews, a 6-3 guard
from Santa Monica, Calif., start-
ed against Robert Morris, played
26 minutes and scored 15 points.

Sean Miller, the 6—foot point
guard from Beaver Falls who
once dribbled basketballs on The
Tonight Show, played 24
minutes, scored 13 points and

' dished out 10 assists.

Another freshman, 6-4 Darelle
Porter from Perry High School on
Pittsburgh's North Side, played
25 minutes and scored four
points.

With the freshmen playing so
much, Gore said Pitt's practices
have been more serious of late.
He said the players know they
have their work cut out for them.

”We definitely can't take any-

I ‘ . fa?!» I/W

er adds insult to injury

one lightly,” Gore said. ”We
have to work harder because we
have the freshmen in there. It's
gonna be a lot tougher.”

The last time freshmen figured
so extensively in Pitt's attack was
1984, when Gore and 6-10
Charles Smith came in.

Both started — Smith at forward
and Gore at off-guard. Smith
scored 14 points and Core 12 in
the season opener that year, a
104-88 victory over St. Francis.

Gore and Smith perhaps were
under less pressure to produce
because they were not playing on
a team ranked No. 4 by The As-
sociated Press and No. 5 by Unit-
ed Press International. They were
not playing a non—conference
schedule that included road
games at West Virginia, Akron,
Jacksonville and Oklahoma,
either.

Regardless, Gore believes
thingswill get more routine for
the freshmen once he and
Brookin have recovered.

”|t’s gonna be a lot easier for
them because they won't be in a
position where they have to
play,” Gore said. ’’I think Charles
Smith and l were in a situation
where we had to be in the
hneup/’

Pitt finished the 1984 season at
17-12, losing in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament to Loui-
siana Tech 78-54.

Time for a little basketball
jeopardy to welcome the fun and
games "back to the Fitzgerald
Field‘House. Are our contestants
ready?

OK, let's begin then. The topic
is Pitt basketball for $200.

The answer is  The most fea-
tured, if not the all-around best,
player ever to wear a Pitt Panther
basketball uniform, a unanimous
preseason All-American, the sixth
leading scorer in Panther history
and Pitt's complementary bounce
pass to the NCAA tournament, all
rolled into one 6-foot-10
uniformed number 32?

BUZZZZZZZZZ. ”Who is
Thaddeus Gerensky?” ‘

Sorry, sir. You are correct in
identifying Thaddeus Gerensky
as a former Pitt basketball play-
er, but he performed his round-
ball duties in the lone year of
1948, during the days of the two-
handed set shot and black high-

top Converse Chuck Taylors, not
in the present times of the two-
handed reverse Phi Slamma Jam-
ma power slam studies and high-
top two-tone Converse Weapons.

l’ll repeat the answer for our
other contestants: ”The most fea-
tured ..." —— BUZZZZZZZZZ.

”Who is Harry Rabinowitz?”

Heh, Heh, Uh, sorry, Ma’am.
indeed Mr. Rabinowitz was at
one time a crucial part of the Pitt
basketball program, but, uh, his
role was solely that of team
manager from 1952-53. Interest-
ing guess, though.

Panel, the question is who is
Charles Smith. Charles  Smith.
Kinda surprised no one got that
right. Once again, the correct
response is Charles  Smith.

And we'll be right back, if this
program is miraculously not can-
celed, after a word from the Roy
Chipman School of Modern Day
Basketball Trivia for Under-
privileged Souls Still Dwelling in
the Days of Lousy Pitt Hoops.

probably would have an easier
time rounding up archaic Thad-
deus Gerensky film footage than
you would finding basketball fans
who didn't know who Charlie
Smith of Pitt hoops fame was.

Coach Jim Boeheim of Syra-
cuse has a pretty good idea of
what to do when his club runs
across our topic of conversation:
”You have to double— and triple-
team Charles Smith or he'll kill
you.”

And pity those sheltered teams
on the 1987-88 Panther schedule
who don't because they're gon-
na find out their mistake in one
heckuva hurry.

Smith speaks of his decision to
forego the NBA draft and become
eligible for his senior season in
college — he is a Pitt Panther for
one more year, and that's the bot-
tom of the basket.

0 ’’I don't even read the papers
to see what's going on in the
NBA,” says Smith. ”That’s for the-
future. Right now, I'm looking in
the papers to see what's going on
in the college atmosphere.”

And what he will undoubtedly
find are loads and loads of arti-

Sm.ith——

Continued from page 4

cles on the lofty expectations of
one Charles Smith and the rest of
his Pitt Panther teammates. Ex-
pectations that, on occasion,
Smith finds a bit unfounded.

"If you look at it, we're an en-
tirely different team than last
year's [a 25-8 NCAA qualifier].
We lost some very important
people for one reason or another
[shooting guard Curtis Aiken to
graduation, point guard Mike
Goodson to academia anemia
and forward Brian Shorter to the
48th Proposition].

"In the Big East alone, every-
thing is up for grabs. It seems
every team is missing one crucial
part, and that seems to balance
things out within the confer-
ence,” stresses Smith.

"Look at us —— we're missing
our point guard. Syracuse is miss-
ing the outside shooting with the

graduation of Howard Triche and

[Greg] Monroe. Georgetown is
looking for someone at center.
Seton Hall has a lot of talent but
is still just learning to win. We're
not really that much better off
than the next team. There are just
too many ifs on this team right
now for us to be flying high 0

that preseason stuff." ‘

One aspect in which there are '

no ifs, ands or buts is the role
Smith must play on the team if
the Panthers are going to be at
least equally successful this
season.

"It’s simple," says Pitt head
coach Paul Evans. "We need
more scoring and rebounding
from Charles. Teams will be dou-
ble and trip|e—teaming him, but
he's got to produce to free up the
other players/f

’ Smith led the team in scoring
lastseason with a 17.0 points per
game while chipping in 8.5 re-
bounds per contest. He also set

I a team record for blocked shots
in a season with 106, eclipsing
the record of 81 he set as a
sophomore. And somehow, he is
expecting even bigger things out
of himself this season.

'’I look at it this way — against
the Canadian team [a Pitt exhibi-
tion game on Nov. 16], I scored
25 points and had 10 rebounds,
and I didn't think I played a very
good game," says Smith. "If

Charles Smith will have to score more this season accordingto Paul

things go like that for me the rest
of the year, I should have a pret-
ty good season scoring—wise. I'm
gonna keep working hard ‘ to
make sure I don't have too many

bad games or slumps, even
though I'm going to draw a lot of
doubIe—teaming and things like
that." '

'»PI'lT Hoops, Monday, November 30, I987

 

By Christopher Sepesy

Staff Writer

At 6-foot—6, /erome Lane is con-
sidered of moderate size for a
basketball player. But to Big East
opponents, he's bigger than
Kareem Abdul-/abbar. However,
that's not surprising when one
considers Lane /ed the country in
rebounding last year, the shortest
player to do so since 7957.

Lane doesn't think he can win
the rebounding title again this
season. But that shouldn't be a
concern for Panther fans. Lane
has his sights set on another title,
the national title. Can Pitt win it?
Lane hopes so, and don't forget,
’Rome usually gets what he
wants —- at least on the basket-
ball floor.

Q: Going into this season,
everyone has high hopes for [er-
ome Lane. just how good do you
think Jerome Lane is?

A: I think I'm a pretty good‘

player, but I think I still need to
do a lot of work on a lot of things.
I just don't want anybody to think
I'm that arrogant to be able to say,
"Hey, look at me, I'm the best
player we've got.” I'm not that
way. Like I said, I still have a lot
of work to do in certain areas.
As far as that one prediction of
me being [Big East] Player of the
Year already, /well, I don't know
how they can just pick me and
say that's that, when you've got
two seven—footers right there in
the middle who can just
dominate any time. See, that's
hard. That confuses me, and I

‘ know it confuses the people.

Q: But you can obviously see
some credibility in it, can't you?
A: Well, yes and no. So maybe
just right now, I'm just 'a gim-
mick. But if I can come through

' with everything I want to do and

everything everybody else wants
me to do, then it will be a great
thing for me [to be Player of the
Year].

Q: lust what are some of these
things you ‘feel you have to
"work on"?

A: Well, I have some work to
do on defense and some work to
do on shooting. Once I get those
things out of the way, then I think
I'll be the player that everybody
thinks I am.

Q: Last year was a virtuous sea-
son for the team — a return to the
NCA/is after so long an absence,
co-champions of the Big East,
you were the leading rebounder
in the country. Do the hopes and
aspirations of last year carry over
to this year?

A: Well, our biggest hope last '

year was to get to the Final Four,
and that just didn't happen.

Q: Is it a viable assumption that
this year it might happen? is that
the team's goal again?

A: Well, I hope, but there are
some things against us. For one
thing, we don't have the people
we should have to work with to
get to the Final Four. But if we
can jell together like we should
and as the season progresses, we
get better and better instead of
being good at the beginning of
the season and then slacking off
near the end; then we may have"
a chance at the Final Four.

lerome Lane, shown dunking against Connecticut, isn't hesitant to voice his opinion.

at the end of the season like we're‘
supposed to, then I think we'll
definitely be in the Final Four,
no problems at all.

But that's only if we can do the
things like I said before. If we
don't have all the effort all the
time out of everybody, then
there's no way the Final Four is
going to be for us.

Q: How about the Big East?

A: Oh, I don't know. The Big
East is just a lot of competition.
Every night you've got to come
out and play them, and there will
be times when somebody will
have a bad night or something,
and it will be a big letdown or
something’, and boom — there
goes the...se’ason.,

It's times like that the competi-
tiveness really can get to some-
body because it's a lot of work
having to come out and play on
such a heavy schedule. And if
you win, you're a hero, and if you
lose, you're nothing. That's hard.

All I can say for us is if every-
body comes out playing the way
they should, well then, we got a
great shot at winning the Big East.

Q: When did you first really
turn on to basketball?

A: Well, I've been playing
basketball since I was a little kid
in the fourth grade. But when I
was young, my main goal was
that I wanted to play baseball. But

as the years_pro_gressed and as I.
got older and ‘really started to.

' I ls’-ml’.-~ n"»'o'o"n‘” e.‘-'.Q"~«'.' -I

I1! “ ‘M,Q'.‘:‘.:.-l..r' 3;’ *1‘

grow all over the place, I started
liking basketball; But baseball
was still in the back of my mind.

But whenever I got to high
school, I just said to myself for-
get it and that I was only going
to stick to one thing instead of
picking a dual thing, and I put my
mind to basketball instead of
baseball.

Right now, it seems like it's all
working out for me. Just as long
as I can keep my head into it and
keep working the way I'm sup-
posed to, then I don't think I'll
have any problem of getting to
where I want to go and to where
I'm supposed to be. I don't see
anything in the .future to really
stop. me unless I get. hurt or

 

something.

Q: How did basketball fit in
with your other interests while
you were growing up?

A: Well, when I was younger,
it seemed like everybody wanted
to try a little bit of everything. You
know, try a little bit of this and try
a little bit of that. I loved sports,
you know, so anything we
played, Lreally got into it. I loved
anything we played, and I could
do everything. So I worked hard
at it because I was a competitive
person, So it didn't make any
difference what sport it was, I just
worked hard because I wanted to
beat my friends at it because it
was competing.

Q: Do you look back on your
childhood with fondness? Do
you have any regrets? ‘

A: Most definitely with fond-
ness, no regrets. I think I had a
great childhood. You know, I
have a great set of parents.-My
mom, my grandmother, my
grandfather; all down the line. I
think my family has been a great
support behind me, and I've got
to give them a lot of credit. If it
weren't for them, I don't think!
would be where I'm at now. You

know, there's other people who ’

are straight out just not doing the
right thing still, you know, drugs
and stuff like that.

So I think I had a great family

who actually backed me up to

have the things and to let me go
and play the sports. When I ac-
tually needed this and that for
sports, they were there to help
me. They didn't deny me  play-

ing it, and I think if they would »

have denied me playing those
sports then, I very easily could

have been a druggie or a stealer

[sic] or something like that be-
cause I think I would have been
hanging around the wrong
crowd.

Q: Do you still know a lotof
those types of people?

A: The people who I hang with
now are my friends who are into
sports or have a job or something

and not those kinds of people

who are just into drugs.

Q: When you got to Pitt, how
did you feel about what you
might do?

A:‘Well, first of all, when I got
to Pitt, I really got a big disap-
pointment. They told me I was
going to play guard, and this dis-
appointed me. And then I ended
up playing power forward. I was
just disappointed about the
whole situation.

And then, all the people were
saying, ‘Oh, he's just a big baby’
and all that shit, and you know,
people just don't understand
[that] coaches will recruit you for
anything. And then when you get
here, it's an entirely  different
story; They just don't understand.
Then once you start talking back
and not doing what they want
you to do because where you're
at isn't where you want to be at
like they told you to, then people
start [downgrading] you because
you're not playing hard where
they have you. But they don't un-
derstand the whole situation
that's going on inside the organi-
zation. They tell you you'll do
one thing and then have you do-
ing another, you know.'That real-

PITT HOOPS, Monday, November 30, I987

 

_
B ° ’

I hate to commit myself to
predictions before the season
starts. (Well, actually Pitt's season
started Saturday night against
Robert Morris, but I wrote this
piece last Friday. Trust me.) But
I guess it's better than committing
myself after the season has
finished, right? _

Nonetheless, I thought I would
ruminate on what will happen to
the Pitt basketball teamthis sea-
son. I'm sure I'll be erroneous in
some of my judgements, and
there may be other predictions I
get right that will seem very evi-
dent to the average hoops fan.

The past two weeks, my in-
quisitive hoops-state—of—mind has

‘ led me to ponder many questions

about this talented Pitt basketball
team. I've been in the lab look-
ing through my media guides and
yearbooks, and I've spent the past
month analyzing Paul Evans’
practices.

‘ I've concocted 10 theories on
Pitt basketball, and here they are.
Analyze ’em and dispute ’em, but
I doubt you can refute ’em.

Theory No. 1 — Pitt really
hasn't hit the big time in the Big
East Conference just yet, and it
won't happen this year. You'll
notice something interesting on
Pitt's schedule. When the Pan-
thers travel to Villanova and St.
John's this season, the games will
take place in the Wildcats’ on-
campus gym and the Redmen’s
on—campus gym, instead of in the
Spectrum and Madison Square
Garden, respectively.

Are the Panthers still such an
unknown entity that they
couldn't‘ fill up these two big—time
facilities, like Georgetown and
Syracuse are given the opportu-
nity to do.?

Theory No. 2 — Paul Evans
misses Brian Shorter as much as
Mike Goodson. OK, so this may
seem like one of the obvious
ones, but it really isn't. One
would think Goodson’s back-
court play would do more for this
front—line dominated Panther
squad than another big brute, but
not neccesarily. '

Shorter, he's a player. Guys his
size with his kind of tremendous
ability aren't easy to find. Put him
at power forward next to Charles
Smith, put Brookin at small for-
ward and you can even toy with
playing Jerome Lane some at
two-guard.

Or put Lane at small forward,
make Demetreus Gore the two-
guard and bring Rod Brookin off
the bench. Or put Shorter at small
forward. Or  ’

absence leaves Panthers shorter

Get the point. Goodson’s
presence would have stabilized
Pitt's point guard position, but
Shorter’s presence would have
maximized the possibilities of
moving the Panthers’ many multi-
faceted players around at the 2,
3 and 4 positions, making Pitt's
front-line more powerful. ‘

Theory No. 3 — Bouncing off
the previous theory, if Pitt had
Goodson and Shorter, going to
the Final Four would be expect-
ed of the Panthers. Now, many
experts don't think Pitt can do it.
But that kind of prognosis is prob-
ably all the better for Evans’ team,
from a psychological standpoint.

Theory No. 4 — Jerome Lane
won't average 13 rebounds per
game. Would you want him to?
The guy has to improve his
defense and scoring ability. If he
concentrates on those things,
he'll average 10 boards a game,
max. But if Rome is able to im-
prove his matador defense, as
Evans calls it, and still get his 13
rebs, look out. He'd be a lock for
Big East Player of the Year.

Theory No. 5 — Sean Miller».
will be Pitt's point guard before
the Big East season starts. I'd
rather not elaborate. My reason-
ing would take up more bytes
than this computer disk can
handle.

Theory No. 6 — Pitt wil|‘final- _
ly beat St. John's. Doesn't sound
like too difficult a prediction. But
the Panthers haven't defeated
Louie Carnesecca’s Redmen

since  wait a minute, let me get -

since Jan. 16, 1984.

The Panthers have lost seven
straight to St. John's. Charles
Smith and Demetreus Gore have
experienced a lot of great mo-
ments on the basketball floor at
Pitt, but they still don't know
what it feels like to beat a team
coached by a short little Italian
with a raspy voice.

By the end of this season,
they'll knowthe feeling.

Theory No. 7 — Pitt will finish
second or third in the Big East.

Gore ready
for season
despite his
bad ankle

' By Sam Tallarjco

Sports Editor

Coming into his final season as
a Panther, senior guard/forward
Demetreus Gore was looking to
improve from last year's decline
and hoping to enjoy the success
he had as a sophomore.

However, in late September,
Gore severely sprained his right
ankle in a pick-up game at the
Fitzgerald Field House, putting
his season on hold for the time
being. The injury has left Gore
somewhat frustrated, but he finds
himself fortunate because the in-
jury occurred so early in the year.

”With this being my last
chance, my last season, it makes
it more frustrating. Your mind
wants to do something your body
can’t,” said Gore, the 6-foot-5,
210-pounder from Detroit, Mich.

”If you're gonna have injuries,
you better have them now. It
won't hurt us as much as it will
later like during the Big East. You
have to expect injuries,” he
added.

In his sophomore season at Pitt,

A Gore shot 56 percent from the

floor, 84 percent from the_free
throw line and averaged 3.8 re-
bounds. He also chipped in with
42 steals as well as leading the
team in scoring (16.1 points per
game).

Last season, Gore suffered
through a period of inconsisten-
cy, noticeably after the Rainbow
Classic, when he scored 30
points against Wisconsin in the
championship game.

Despite improving his passing .

skills (107 assists — up from 78
his sophomore year), he shot 45
and 77 percent from the field and

Demetreus Gore says his ankle is almost 100 percent now.

free throw line, respectively,
while his scoring dropped to 12.9
ppg, fourth best on the team. It
was after the Rainbow Classic
that the Panthers began their Big
East play, which Gore knew he

didn't do as well as he's capable '

of doing. '
”Last season was our best sea-
son. It took some of the pressure
off, but personally, I could have
done better,” said Gore.
Speaking of the Big East, the
Panthers are slated to begin their
conference schedule on Jan. 6 at
Georgetown, which is about the
time Pitt head coach Paul Evans
expects Gore to be in full force.
”He may be 100 percént in
January, but he should be able to
play against Robert Morris [Nov.
28],” said Evans. ,
Gore feels he can play now but
agrees with Evans that he'll be

ready by January.

’’I’m in good enough shape to
play. Wherever the coach needs
me, I;ll'be ready to play,’’ said
Gore, referring to where he will
play when he returns. ”By Janu-

ary, I should be 100 percent — L

at least I should be effective.
Hopefully by crunch time, I'll be
all right.”

As for now, Gore is trying to
keep his weight down since he
missed‘ the first two weeks of
practice. He has returned to prac-
tices, but he still is trying to re-
habilitate his right ankle.

A ”I’ve been riding a bike a lot.
I'm able to run, so I'm running a
lot, too," said Gore. , .

As the season begins, Gore
may not be in perfect condition,
but with this being his last season,
it's going to be hard to keep him
down.

 

PITT HOOPS, Monday, November 30,1937

Young Pitt guards will
have to stand tall fast

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Big men win basketball games, but little men win national
championships. Says who? '

Undoubtedly, many college coaches who adhere to the theory
that good guard play is a must if_a team hopes to survive in
the NCAA tournament.

That's why the Pitt Panthers, despite their high preseason rat-
ings, have problems that must be solved if they hope to live
up to their billing."

The Panthers (25-8 last season) return what may be the best
one-tvvo punch in the country in 6-foot-10 senior center Charles
Smith and 6-6 junior forward Jerome Lane —- both of whom
were All-Big East performers last year.

But whether or not Pitt goes further than last year in the Big
East and NCAA tournaments is debatable.

The Panthers lost their top two guards from last year, and there
are no guards with any valuable experience returning. Curtis
Aiken graduated, and Mike Goodson quit going to class. Good-
son, who started every game last year at point guard, is an aca-
demic casualty and will not play this season.

So who's going to get Smith and Lane the ball? Evans is still
trying to figure that out.

”There’s no doubt the loss of Goodson hurt- us. He was our
best defensive guard. He really improved a lot this summer,”
said Evans. '

Evans will have to go with 6-2 sophomore Pat Cavanaugh
or 6-foot freshman Sean Miller in Goodson’s place.

Cavanaugh, who was a walk-on last year, earned a scholar-
ship and started the season opener Saturday night against Robert
Morris. ' 7

If Cavanaugh falters, Evans will have to go with Miller, an
All-State performer last year at Blackhawk High School.

The Panthers inexperience isn't atrthe one guard position
alone. The two-guard spot is "also a cause for concern.

Evans originally hoped to play Demetreus Gore at the two-
guard spot, but Gore has missed a lot of practice time due to
a sprained ankle. He hasn't had a chance to get acclimated to
two-guard, the position he played two years ago as a sopho-
more when he led the Panthers in scoring. 1

There has been one bright spot about Gore's injury -— it has
given freshmen Jason Matthews and Darelle Porter a chance
to get a lot of quality minutes early in the season.‘

Matthews started Saturday's game against Robert Morris and
will continue to start at least until small forward Rod Brookin
(out with a separated shoulder) returns.

Brookin’s injury moved Gore to small forward and gave Mat-
thews and Porter more playing time at two-guard in Saturday's
96-70 win. V A

One-would think Evans would be pleased to have the oppor-
tunity to play his young guards so much earlier in the season.

But Evans isn't smiling. ”I’m not happy about it now, but I might

be in February.”

PITT HOOPS, Monday, November 30, I987



Last year, the Pitt and Syracuse
basketball teams met at Pitts-
burgh's Civic Arena on Feb. 9 in
a game that decided first place in
the Big East Conference. The Are-
na was packed that blustery

. Monday evening, as over 16,000

fans braved the elements of a
Pittsburgh winter night to see the
game.

Many other fans stayed home
to watch the game on ESPN. Or
so they thought.

With the game being a sell—out,
the Pitt Athletic Department
decided to have the game
blacked out within a 35—miIe
radius of Pittsburgh.

Obviously, many fans were
disappointed and angered with
the decision.

Nothing has changed since last
year, though. Pitt's athletic
department once again has the
authority to black out home
games.

One particular student has
found this policy quite bother-
some and has come up with what

’ he thinks is a viable solution to

the problem.
By Mark Yanalitis

For The Pitt News

ESPN will‘ nationally televise
seven Pitt Big East basketball
games this season. ESPN, which

has the exclusive cable rights to
Big East Conference games, will
televise Pitt at Georgetown Jan. 6,
Providence at Pittlan. 25, Pitt at
Boston Collegejan. 30, Pitt at St.
John's Feb. 3, Syracuse at Pitt
Feb. 10, Pitt at Seton Hall Feb. 22
and Seton Hall at Pitt March 2.

Of those seven games, Panther
fans will be able to see only four.
Pitt's home games against Provi-
dence, Syracuse and Seton Hall
will be blacked out in the im-
mediate Pittsburgh area.

You guessed right, sports fans,
three of Pitt's big conference
games are sell-outs and, there-
fore, there will be blackouts in
and around the city.

There is only one game that all
Panther supporters can view and
that is on Feb. 20 at the Civic Are-
na, when the Panthers entertain
Georgetown on CBS.

I guess this season will be a
repeat of last year, when Panther
fans had to pace about much like

expectant fathers waiting for"

news about the score of the Pitt
game. Not to demean the other
Big East opponents, but why are
the most influential and emotion-
al games so inaccessible to the
Pitt student body?

Since Pitt entered the Big East
Conference in 1982, it has set at-
tendance records each of the past

‘two years at the Civic Arena and

ANALYSIS

Fitzgerald Field House.

So that's the motive  -green-
backs. Pitt's athletic department
rakes in the money and jilts the
students on some quality
basketball.

Pitt associate athletic director
Dean Billick said this isn't the
case. ”The athletic department
generates no revenue from
Arena-hosted games. The Civic

Arena~Corporation retains all tick—_

et stubs, parking, concessions

and retail sales revenue created. '

Conversely, when Pitt hosts a
game at Fitzgerald Field House,
[the athletic department] keeps
the revenue generated.”

Billick added the basic
philosophy of the Pitt athletic
department is to maintain an on-
campus policy with regard to Pitt
basketball and is against any fu-
ture schedulings of games at the
Civic Arena. ‘

' John Blanton, Pitt assistant ath-
letic director for business and
management, is responsible for
accounts receivable in the athlet-
ic department. Blanton said it
isn't economically warranted for

Pitt to host games at the Civic

Arena.

there at all?
Billick said the Big East has the

authority to tell Pitt to play two

games a year at the Civic Arena.

Kimball Smith, Pitt's director of
ticket sales and promotions in the
athletic department, said, ”[The
Big East] suggests that certain
games be played at a larger facil-
ity. They are trying to establish an
image of being able to fill the
larger buildings.”

The blackout policy doesn't sit
well with the students, but they
could probably live with the fact
two games are held each year at
the Civic Arena.

The main concern of the stu-
dents is resolving the blackout
problem, so all Pitt students can
see every home game. '

If Pitt still aligns itself to its stat-
ed ”on-campus” policy, why
doesn't the athletic department
set up a closed-circuit viewing
system at David Lawrence Au-
ditorium, allowing Pitt students
the opportunity to view the game
live rather than days later via tape
delay?

For this season, this proposal
would require the purchase of ca-
ble rights to three home games -
Providence, Syracuse and Seton
Hall.

A nominal fee could be con-
tracted to cover the cost of oper-
ation, and concessions could be
set to further defer the cost of the
operation.

READ

The PI'I"I' NEWS

Pitt should let fans in on the action also

Consider Smith's statement that
”because Pitt basketball atten-
dance has been at a maximum,
expenditures for marketing have
been at a minimum.”

Couple this with the recent in-
crease in ticket prices for season
ticketholders of reserved seats at
Fitzgerald Field House, and one
would be led to believe money
would be available to finance a
closed-circuit viewing system.

Additionally, if the network

was promising, the University of _

Pittsburgh at Greensburg is a via-
ble market because it lies within
the 35-mile blackout range.

Who would organize and oper-
ate this inspiration?

If the athletic department
wished to initiate, but not regu-
late the broadcasts, it could re-
quest that Student Government
Board allocate funding for the
program through the fiscal oper-
ating budget for the Audio-Visual
Club. The Audio-Visual ‘Club
could organize and operate the
broadcasts. This would eliminate
any financial dent on the athletic
department's fiscal budget be-
cause university—allocated funds
would be used.

For a small amount of effort,
Pitt students could still be part of
Panther victories, while the ath-
letic department could create a
very‘ positive image for itself in
the eyes of students.

Editor in Chief

Paul Evans’ Pitt Panthers and
Jim Boeheim’s Syracuse Orange-
men have been picked by the Big
East's nine coaches to finish one
and two, respectively, in the con-
ference this season, but don't get
too excited. ~

Evans and Boeheim surely are
not.

Both coaches sound as if they
would rather be in Boston Col-
lege coach Jim O’Brien’s posi-
tion. The Eagles have been
picked last in the coaches’ poll,
just where they finished last year.

Well, surely Evans and Boe-
heim wouldn't want to be where
the Eagles try to fly, but they still
don't like having their teams rat-
ed so high going into the season.

”No. 1?” muses Evans.'”They
[the coaches] should come watch
us practice. Sometimes it looks
like the blind leading the blind.”

But don't worry, Paul. Your.
Panthers will be good, but Syra-
cuse, because of a guy named
Douglas, may be even better.

Here's a' rundown of the Big/

East teams ranked one through
nine:
0 One Keith Smart jump shot

iwas all that stood in the way of

Syracuse winning the national
championship last year. But this
season, the Orangemen could be
right there in the Final Four again,
this time in Kansas City.

Boeheim’s team returns three
starters. All three players are All-
America candidates. Six-foot-11
senior center Rony.Seikaly and
6-9 sophomore forward Derrick
Coleman can put the ball in the
hoop, and Douglas, a 6-1 junior
guard, can get it to them.

Nevertheless, Boeheim isn't
making reservations for Kansas
City just yet.

”Georgetown beat us three
times last year, and Pittsburgh
beat us twice. I would think we
could be picked third in the
league,” said Boeheim.

‘While Syracuse didn't recruit a
single player last season, it will
still have a new face on the court.
Prep All-America Earl Duncan, a
6-3 guard who sat out last season
due to Proposition 48, will
challenge for playing time.

Despite the wealth of talent
Boeheim possesses, he's very
concerned with the graduation
losses of starters Greg Monroe
(12.9 points per game) and
Howard Triche (11.8 ppg).

”We have a whole team. The
big three are back, but the other
two were the reason we got
where we got,” Boeheim said of
Triche and Monroe. ”We have to
get something out of our new
people. This team's nothing like
the team from last year.”

Steve Thompson, a 6-4 sopho-

_ more, and Duncan should battle

for Monroe's vacant off-guard
spot, while Thompson, Herman
Harried and Keith Hughes will all

see action at Triche’s small for-7

and Pittsburgh beat us

ward position. \_

The Orangemen will depend
on 6-5 sophomore forward Matt

Roe to give them‘ some outside
scoring, which is one of the few

possible weaknesses on the

squad.

Adding to Boeheim’s worries is
the idea the Orangemen players
may not have forgotten about the
Indiana game just yet. ”Are we
going to think about the-champi-
onship game and dwell on it, or
are we going to forget about it
and go on and work to get back
there?” asked Seikaly. ”l’ve had
my sleepless nights, but we're
looking forward .to this year.”

And for good reason.

0 Pitt may have the best inside
one-two punch in the country
with 6-10 senior center Charles
Smith and 6-6 junior forward Jer-
ome Lane. But who's going to get
them the ball?

Obviously, the Panthers’ suc-
cess will be contingent on the
play of‘ their inexperienced
guards.

Last year's starting point guard,

Syracuse, Pitt's big men will rise 2

Mike Goodson, was an academ-
ic casualty and Curtis Aiken (14.2
ppg) was lost to graduation.
That leaves Pitt with a sopho-
more (6-2 Pat Cavanaugh), three
freshmen (6-3‘/2 Darelle Porter,
6-3 Jason Matthews and 6-1 Sean
Miller) and a senior (6-5 De-
metreus Gore) in the backcourt.
”We’ll be young in the back-
court, but we may be able to run
a little more and do some things
we -weren't able to do last sea-

: son,” said Evans.

Pitt also returns 6-5 sophomore

Rod Brookin (10.2 ppg), why

may have been the most surpris-
ing ‘rookie in the league last
season. »

However, Brookin has a sepa-
rated shoulder and may not be
ready to go full strength until

‘ January.

If Brookin gets healthy, a front-
line consisting of Brookin, Lane ,
and Smith, with 6-9 Parade'All-
America Bobby Martin coming
off the bench, will be hard to
contest.

”Hopeful|y, our inside game
will compensate for some of the
weaknesses we have in the back-
court,” added Evans.

°Georgetown loses All-

America Reggie Williams, _but,.

remember, John Thompson's
team survived the loss of Patrick
Ewing also.

”Reggie’s leaving wasn't a sur- 
prise for us. We knew he was 
leaving after four years,” saith-as

Thompson. ‘

Get the hint. ,

The Hoyas will be as tough as
even_

Ten players return who played
an average of at least 10 minutes
per game last year.

Six-4 senior forward Perry
McDonald (13.0 ppg and 6.5 rpg)
is the Hoyas’ star.

Besides McDonald, George-
town has numerous capable big
men. Six-8 Ronnie Highsmith,

.6-7 Anthony Allen, 6-9 Sam

Jefferson and 7-foot Ben Gillery

will all get quality minutes.
The 6-9 junior center Johna-

than Edwards may have the most

ability of any of the Hoyas’ inside -

players, but he missed 11 games
last year‘ with a back injury.

In the backcourt, Thompson,
once again, has the horses with

ly. tends to piss you off. It really
got "to me my freshman year.
Q: About the coaches —

' you've had two since you've

been here. Under Roy Chipman,
you were reportedly a sullen
player, you seemed not to know

I where you were going. Then last

year for Paul Evans, you really
took off.
A: Well, let me interrupt be-

I A cause I know what you're getting

at. I don't know the recruiting
side of Coach Evans and how he
does it or anything, but for Chip-

* man, well, his approach worked
pretty well. And he suckered me,

I think. I don't think that was
ﬁght

' But comparing the coaches —
when I was coming into my

sophomore season, I knew I was .

going to play power forward be-
cause we already had too many
guards. So I just set my mind and
dedicated myself into going and
playing that role.

— But with the Chipman situa-

 tion, well, it was literally just
‘messed up for me.

Q: Have you and Evans had
any problems seeing eye to eye?

A: Well, you know, off the
court, we're just two ordinary
people. But on the courts, you
know, the man's just got to do his
job; anybody just has to do their
job. You know you're not going
to like him because you don't like
the way he's doing it. But you
know you've got to give the man
credit because he's winning
games. So I don't [downgrade]

 1 him.

1 You know, off the court, we see
eye to eye. It's just certain play-
ing things. People look at us on
the court and think we don't like
each other. He's all right with me
off the court, but on the court, I
really think he's a bitch, basically.

Q: But you still like to go along

 with his way?

A: Yeah. I'm within the system.
I'm not trying to get out of it.

Q: How do Chipman’s and
Evans’ coaching methods really
differ?

A: Oh, man, the coaching sys-
tems are of two different people.
Man, Chipman just didn't know
how to coach at all. Period. He's
a great person and a great man off
the court, but when it came to
crucial situations, Chipman
would just panic. He wouldn't
know what to do. He'd be asking
other coaches what to do.

‘ 

 but on the court, I
really think he's [Evans]
a bitch, basically.

- Ierome Lane

With Evans, when it comes
down to his game-time situation
where it is crucial, he knows
what to do, what to call, what
plays to call and what to do.

You know, it's a difference —
a panic coach and a subtle coach.

Q: Have you benefitted great-
ly from Evans coming to Pitt?

A: It didn't make any difference
what coach would come in here.
I just know what I have to do to
get where I want to be.

Q: It's no secret you've had a
few problems with the media.
Can you elaborate?

A: The media always mis-
quotes you. They put things
down that you didn't say. And I

told whoever it was down at The I

Pitt News that time, I forget his
name not to call my mom that
time, and he did anyway [about
someone] stealing my car, and
they did it anyway. So I told him
I wasn't going to talk to him any-
more. They went against my will

about calling my mom, and they .

did it anyway. So I don't want to
talk to him anymore._

Q: Is there anything you would
really like the media to know?

A: I just think they go against
my will, and I don't like it.

Q: Do you feel the media
wants to portray you in a nega-

tive light?

A: They're just out to get a story
any kind of way, and I don't think
that's right. I tell them not to do
one thing, and then they want to
talk to me during the season. You
just don't do that. You gotta com-
promise with me to get what you
want.

Q: In late September, you were
involved in an off—campus fight in
which you were accused of as-
sault. Do you have anything to
say about the incident, which
you didn't before?

A: All I can say is that I went
over there to help a friend. And
all I did was a lot of talking; I
didn't throw one punch. Hell,
they couldn't even tell Rod

[Brookin] from another person.’

How in the hell are they going to
tell me from another person? I
didn't throw one punch, and
they're just going to blame me
that I did. So, basically, I didn't
do anything. That's all it boils
down to.

Q: Do you think you may have
been accused just because of
who you are?

A: I don't know. All I can say
is I didn't do anything. I got
blamed for something I didn't do.
I was known all over the world
for being a violent person, which
I'm not. So I think that was pretty
wrong of those people down
there and the media to just go out
there and say something when I
didn't have anything to say to
make a backup story.

Q: Is the whole situation over
yet?

A: As’ far as I know and as far
as I'm concerned, it's done.

Q: What are your goals for the
team this year?

A: Well, as far as the team's
goals, I don't know. I hope it is
just tocome out and win. For me,
it's just about the same: work
hard, do the things I have to do
and win.

Q: What is your major here at
Pitt?

A: Liberal arts. I don't have any
specific direction.

Q: Do you enjoy school?

{I '

Martin needs to learn finer points of game

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

When you're a Parade All-
American and considered one of
the top 25 high school players in
the country, there tends to be a
bit more pressure on you than,
say, any other player in the his-
tory of Atlantic City High School
basketball.

This would best describe the
situation for Bobby Martin, the
6-foot-9 talent the Panthers
recruited to alleviate some of the

‘ 

In high school, we
never really concen-
trated on playing
defense. You didn't
learn it during the sea-
son; you had to go to a
basketball summer

camp to pick up those
skills.
— Bobby Martin

burden from Charles Smith's
shoulders.

And with accolades such as
high school All-America, one
might expect Martin to be ner-
vous and, perhaps, unsure of
himself. But fortunately for the
Panthers, this is not the case.

’’I don't feel so much the pres-
sure of the media hype asl do the
pressure of Coach [Paul] Evans’
practices,” said Martin.

Evans knows Martin may some-
day be a tremendous player, but
it will take a bit of work. Martin's
game is far from polished. He is,
to a lesser extent than usually as-
sociated with such players, a
project.

”Right now, Bobby hasn't real-
ly learned the intricacies of our
defensive schemes, but by the
end of his four years here at Pitt,
I know he can be a valuable as-
set,” said Evans.

If one judges. Martin solely on
his performance in practices,
then there might be cause for
concern. For, at times, it appears
Martin has had very little educa-
tion in the way of mastering vari-
ous defenses.

Said Martin, ”In high school,
we never really concentrated on
playing defense. You didn't learn
it during the season; you had to
go to a basketball summer camp
to pick up those skills.”

And if one wants to be educat-
ed in the virtues of playing
defense, it usually helps to have
someone similar in demeanor.
’’Charles [Smith] has really

' helped me in that regard. He's

helped me work on my concen-
tration on the defensive end.

’’I have to adjust my game to
fit Coach Evans’ style, and that

might be the hardest part for me,” A

said Martin.

For a man his size, Martin pos-
sesses a feathery jump shot. He
can hit from 15 feet out. Due to
Martin's already adequate out-
side shooting, he didn't work dur-
ing the summer on that aspect of
his game. ”I wasn't too con-
cerned about my outside shoot-
ing. I worked mainly on my
footwork and trying to establish
my inside postion.”

With Martin's outide shooting
abilities only to improve, he

hopes to eventually be Pitt's_ small _

forward. ”SinceJerome [Lane] is *2
pretty much the power forward,
I see myself pretty much as a
small forward,” said Martin.

However, Evans said Martin
was having a rough time trying to
learn both the small forward and
center positions. Evans has Mar-
tin playing center exclusively
now, and that's the only position
he'll play this season.

Part of Martin's problem, ac-
cording to Evans, is not his abili-
ty (Evans said Martin reminds him
of a young David Robinson) but
his durability. ”Yes, that's some-
thing Bobby needs to improve on
if wants to play a role in our sea— '
son. He needs to improve his
conditioning, so that he doesn't
quickly get tired,” said Evans.

Another player Martin has al-
ready been compared with is
former Villanova star Ed Pinckney
— and that's quite ironic. ”My
idol was Ed Pinckney. I liked the
way he used size in college,
while at the same time, he was
able to play the center position.”

Pinckney led the Villanova
Wildcats to the 1985 NCAA
Championship and was a No. 1
draft choice of the Phoenix Suns.

Originally, Martin intended to
follow in the footsteps of his idol
but changed his mind much to
the chagrin of Villanova coach
Rollie Massimino.

While many people might
recognize Martin for his basket-
ball exploits, he realizes there is
more to life than zone defenses.

”One of the reasons I chose Pitt
was because of its law program.
I think there are a lot of opportu-
nities for me in that profession.” -

Martin once played the lead
role in a high school production

of Jesus Christ Superstar, and I   I"

while the Panthers aren't exactly
in the midst of a rebuilding year,

it would only be appropriate if
Martin could part the Mississippi
River and lead his apostles to the
Promised Land of Kansas City,
Mo., site of the 1988 Final Four.

oping to fulfill critics’ prophecies

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

When we last saw the Pitt Pan-
ther basketball team — that is, on
the basketball court participating
in a game of basketball, not in
some other sort of noteworthy,
notorious news-happening — it
was engaged in a vernal 96-93,
second-round NCAA Tourna-
ment loss to the Oklahoma Soon-
ers way, way out in Tucson, Ariz.
A disappointing defeat without
question for a highly talented
Panther squad, but bygones have
inevitably become bygones, and
the brand-spanking—new 1987-88
season has desscended upon Fitz-
gerald Field House like a, well,
like a hard—driving downpour of
question marks.

‘ 

Look at Louisville last’

season — we're in the
same position‘ they
were in. They were
picked preseason No. 1
with that great front
line of theirs, but they
had injuries and no

backcourt,   and that

killed them.
,— Paul Evans



And just where do these ques-
tion marks originate, for isn't this
supposed‘ to be one of the finest
fives in the land, one that returns
four, pardon, now three starters
from a 25-8 Big East regular-
season champ squad? How can
any self-proclaimed basketball
swami not help but cry out from
the top of the “Cathedral, ”You
gotta love ’em!” Lots of folks have
the Panthers penned in as Final
Four participants this season.

Yet a strange thing happens
when this prognosticating breed
exults its pro-Pitt partiality. For in-
stead of the expected distant echo
reverberating in return, ”You got-
ta love ’em,” onecan faintly hear
the unpleasant but immortal
words of another, ‘lesser known
swami, one whose loyalties lie
with the St. Francis basketball
program but whose battle cry can

. ring just as true for this specific

Pitt team as it has for countless
Red Flash teams.

Cy Facciani of the SFC boosters
has been oft heard crying, ”You
gotta get a point guard!”

Pssssssst. Hey Pitt, you gotta get

A a point guard. - -

And head coach Paul Evans
knows it. Without the point
guard, that is, a capable point
guard, Pitt's superstar tandem of
Jerome Lane and Charles Smith
can lose about 50 percent effec-
tiveness, for researchers just
haven't found a sure-fire method
of scoring without the ball.

”The loss of [last season's point
guard] Mike Goodson really hurt
us,” says Evans. ”He was a good
shooter, our best defensive play-

— er, and most importantly, he had

a full year of experience under his
belt. He knew how to run the
team, and now we've just got to
find somebody else to do the
job.” ' _

Goodson dropped out of Pitt

, due to some sort of academic

difficulty, but, says Evans, "Mike
told me that he was going to en-
roll in January so he'll be eligible
next season.”

But that is next season. For
now, Evans has to rely on a group

of talented freshman and the

returning but semicompetent Pat
Cavanaugh. Cavanaugh holds the
position now, but first-year play-

[The point guard] po-
sition is the biggest
question mark on the

here, that leaves a big
hole in our team.

4 er Sean Miller should take over

with some experience. '’Miller is

_ playing pretty well. I'm happy

with his progress,” says Evans.
Evans also expects freshmen
Darelle Porter and Jason Mat-
thews to contribute heavily,
though the two will be brought
along a bit slower than Miller.
”[l'he point guard] position is
the biggest question mark on the_

‘ team,” says Smith, Pitt's leading

scorer for the last three seasons.
"With Mike not here, that leaves
a big hole in our team. We gotta
look on the bright side, though.
We'll just have to make up for
what we lack with our strengths.”

Now, to top off the inex-

Evans’ Panthers are faced with
another hurdle, this one -in the
form of injuries. Starting swing-
man Demetreus Gore (12.9
points per game last season and
the team's leading free—throw
shooter at 78 percent) has been
hobbled by an ankle injury that
he received in the middle of Sep-
tember. His progress hasn't been
that wonderful.

"Demetreus was having a great
summer, then he hurt. his ankle,
and that's really set him back,”
says Evans. "He's a great offen-

. sive player. He needs to have a

good shooting year. His ankle is

expect him to be playing at full
tilt pretty soon.”

Big things were also expected
out of reserve small forward Rod
Brookin, but he recently sus-
tained a separated left shoulder in
practice and is expected to be out
a month. Last year, as a freshman,
Brookin was outstanding off the
bench, averaging over 10 points
and four rebounds per, game.
Sooo  .

That puts an even bigger bur-
den on freshman Bobby Martin,
a 6-foot-9 forward out of Atlantic
City, N.J. "We'll need an im-
mediate contribution from him

off the bench if we expect‘ to 

reach our peak this season, and
I think he has the ability to come
through for us,” says Evans.
Nate Bailey, a 6-5 transfer from
the Naval Academy, is also ex-
pected to see valuable playing
time this season, although due to
NCAA regulations, he won't be
able to dress until Pitt's game
with Akron Dec. 21. A

And then there is the power
forward Lane and the redoubta-
ble Smith. What else can be said

great offensive player.
He needs to have a
good shooting year. His

lofty ghost—rankings? Preseason
All-America candidate Lane, the
|eading_rebounder (13.5 rpg) in
the country last season, was so
impressive that, according to
Sports Illustrated, Duke forward

John Smith spent the summer
watching videotapes of Lane to
improve his technique. .
Smith, another consensus
preseason All—American who flirt-
ed with turning pro last spring,
has had enough press coverage to
fill a thousand scrapbooks and
draw endless double teams. He
averaged 17 ppg in 1986-87 and
more than ever is expected from
the 6-10 center this season.
How is Evans handling all the
hype for what he calls "the most
talented team I've ever
coached”? *
''I pay no attention to it, and
the players realize it's a joke.
Look at Louisville last season -
we're in the same position’ they
were in. They were picked

front line of theirs, but they had
injuries and no backcourt, and

that killed them. They didn't even 7

finish in the Top 20. We're not
getting carried awayby it."

Evans’ system eases transition for Bailey

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Sure, you've heard all the
hoopla Concerning the wonderful
class of freshmen basketball play-
ers recruited by the Panthers last
year. From Brian Shorter and
Bobby Martin to Sean Miller, just
to mention a few of the high
school All-One-Thing-or-Anothers
in Oakland this year.

Dick Vitale raved (but what
else is new). The preseason hoop-
lit on the newsstands praised.
Panther basketball fans were
crazed. «

And, quietly, Nate Bailey trans-
ferred to Pitt from the Naval
Academy last December.

No fanfare or 21—fou| shot sa-
lute in this transaction ’tvvixt Paul
Evans’ teams. Yet, this Nate
Bailey fella could very easily be-
come a crucial part of the Panther
scheme of things.

A 6-foot-5, 210-pound, redshirt
sophomore, Bailey found that
”the Navy just wasn't for me. I
wasn't interested in the committ-
ment they wanted. The people
there were all very nice, I had no
trouble with them. I just wanted
to see how regular college was.”

As a freshman for the Middies
under then-head coach Paul
Evans, Bailey saw extensive ac-
tion in the 1985-86 ”David
Robinson Cruise-Oh!” 35—game
spectacle season that was finally

' halted on the doorstep of the Fi-
nal Four. He started 11 games for
‘ the team and played in 34, aver-

aging 4.3 points per game ‘and g

3.0 rebounds per game. In fact,
Bailey's high scoring game was
against Big East foe Syracuse (14
points).

’’I came to Pitt basically be-
cause of coach Evans. I knew his
system, the way he runs things,
so I thought the transition would

‘ 

I ‘know [Pitt] is a
talented ball club, and
it's tough just walking
in like I did. But I feel
the things that I have to
offer can help this
team.

— Nate Bailey

be pretty easy. And it was,” said
Bailey. ”What I try to do is help
the other [players] out because I
know basically what he wants out
of them.”

Evans himself is once again
glad to be coaching Bailey.

”Nate’s a hardworking kid,”
said Evans after a mid—November
practice session. ”He’s a physical
player, not afraid to mix it up in
there. He should give us some
good help off the bench.

”Nate is the kind of guy that's
a chemistry-type player. He
doesn't do anything spectacular,
but he does a lot of things well
because of hustle. He has pretty
good smarts out there.”

Although Bailey anticipated
blending well into the Pitt pro-
gram due to his knowledge of
Evans’ scheme, things didn't go
all that smoothly for Bailey in the
early stages of fall practice.

”What happened with Nate
was that he was playing with Jer-
ome [Lane] and Charles [Smith]
and Demetreus [Gore], and he
thought he was going to be like
them, and he just sucked,” said
Evans. ’’I told him, ‘Nate, we
didn't bring you here to be like
Jerome or Charles or anybody
else. You have to be Nate, which
means you do things simply and
agressively.’

”And he's played well ever
since. He'll never be a superstar,
but if he can keep everything
grouped together and get the ball
to the right people and rebound
for us, he can be a tough player,”
added Evans.

Evans expects to use Bailey,
who averaged 21 points and 14
rebounds per game for South
Weymouth (Mass.) High School,
at the small forward position.
However, Evans said Bailey can
even play some high-post and
shooting guard if necessary.

Because Bailey transferred to
Pitt after the 1986-87 season was
already underway, he won't be
able to put on a Panther uniform
until Dec. 21, the day Pitt tack-
les the Akron Zips.

”I know [Pitt] is a talented ball
club, and it's tough just walking
in like I did,” said Bailey. ”But I
feel the things that I have to offer

can help this team."

Lady Panthers have players

to fit Bruce's up-tempo style

By Matt Martin
Staff Writer

After completing a 7-21 season
and graduating three seniors,
most basketball coaches would
be ready to term the following
season a rebuilding year.

But asked under the same cir-
cumstances whether his team will
do well this year, Pitt women's
basketball coach Kirk Bruce said,
with a broad smile, ?’We’re plan-
ning on it.” And with good
reason.

Bruce, in his third year as Lady
Panther head coach, returns three
starters, including leading scorer
and rebounder senior forward
Sally Sheerer and six other let-
termen.

’ But it's not the returning play-
ers who have Lady Panther fans
excited, rather it's the new faces
on the squad that comprise what
may be Pitt's best recruiting class
even

Bruce's optimism seems to be
shared, or at least acknowledged
by the other teams in the Big East.
In a preseason poll of the league's
coaches, the Lady Panthers were
picked sixth.

If the Lady Panthers finish sixth
this season that would be a

I marked improvement over last

year, when they finished ninth —
dead last in the league.

 ”Last year may have been be-,
cause of injuries, or maybe not
; playing hard enough or [not play-

ing] together. But preparation and

_. practice is where it all begii1s,"

Bruce.said. ”Right now, we're
practicing 14 players. I'll use 12

“ or 13 players in each game.

Everyone knows they have ‘a shot
at playing every game.”

Bruce favors an up-tempo style
of play, so it's not surprising to
hear him talk about playing as
many as 13 players in ‘a game.
Last season, nine Lady Panthers
averaged at least 10 minutes of
playing time per game. .

”The players like the up-tempo
game,” Bruce said. ”lt's not fun
for them to‘-just walk the ball up
the court. They'll also be in bet-
ter shape.”

But for his fast-paced game
plan to work, Bruce said his team
will need to rebound better. ’’All
five defensive people will have.to
go in to rebound, or the fastbreak
won't work.” .

The Lady Panthers seem well-
equipped to handle this task.’ Six-
foot senior forward Sally Sheerer
led the team in rebounding, as

I well as scoring last year, averag-

ing 8.3 rebounds and 14.3 points
per ‘game.

Also returning is 5-10 junior
fowvard Tabatha Long, the sec-
ond leading rebounder on the
team. Long, a starter, averaged
6.1 rebounds a game last year
and chipped in 8.4 points per
game also.

Backing up Sheerer and Long
at forward will be 5-10 senior
walk-on LeAnn Burkholder and
5-11 junior Amy Holman.

Also, filling in will be 5-10
freshman Holly Holmes and 5-9
freshman small forward Whitne
Mack, both from Ohio. 

While Bruce has some capable
front-line players returning, the
success of this 1987-88 Lady Pan-
ther basketball team will be con-
tingent on the ability of the
incoming class.

Bruce has brought in three

 

freshman and two junior college
players, while another player is
back after sitting out last season.

Connie Hurt (6-4), a freshman
center from Penn Hills High
School, should be ready to make
an immediate impact at Pitt and
on the Big East. The first team All-
State and Pennsylvania Quad—A
Player of the Year averaged 18
points and 12 rebounds per game
in high school. Hurt is the only
legitimate center on the team and
should see a good deal of play-
ing time.

Also ready to make her
presence known is Deidra Baker,
a transfer from Hilbertjunior Col-
lege in Hamburg, N.Y. Baker, a
5-9 forward averaged 17 points
and seven rebounds per game
last year as she was named first
team Junior College All-America
and Region III Player of the Year.

The one player Pitt fans will be
most anxious to see in action is
5-11 sophomore forward Lorri
Johnson. Johnson, a product of
New Castle High School, was the
leading scorer in Western Penn-
sylvania as a senior. She averaged
29 points a game, as well as nine
rebounds.

Johnson sat out last season af-
ter recurring knee problems re-
quired surgery. Johnson also lost
a year of eligibility because of
Proposition‘48. A

Returning in the backcourt is
5-8» sophomore guard Jennifer

Shingler, whostarted last year. .

Sorren to ’s Pizza
' 2_33(.)Aatg:1)I(1)Ccll St. ’

lj M4

Voted to the Big-East All-
Freshman Team, Shingler aver-
aged 10.7 points and 3.3 re-
bounds per game for the Lady
Panthers.

Joining Shingler in the back-
court will be an assortment of
guards, including 5-7 Denise

_ Becher, who was a teammate of

Baker's at Hilbert Junior College
last season.

Also returning at the guard po-
sitions are 5-5 junior Shaunda
Byrd, 5-6 junior Susan Falvey,
who was injured much of last
season, 5-6 sophomore Karen
Threatt, who started 10 games as
a freshman, and 5-7 sophomore
Jill Sitlinger. Sitlinger missed all
of last season with an ankle inju-

ry.

ent, Bruce is excited about the
season ahead. And he doesn't de-
mand anything more from his
team than hard work. ”We have
set numerous goals for this sea-
son, but our main focus will be
to out-work our opponents. This
squad knows what I expect from
them in the off-season, preseason
conditioning and the preseason.
The players know how strongly
I believe in the up-tempo game,
and they have dedicated them-
selves to preparing for this style
of play,” he said.

Pitt's first home game is against
rival Penn State Dec. 5 at Fitzger-
ald Field House.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 30, 1987

Big Brother has adopted a whole new family

Some trends in new legislation
seem to be gripping the United
States with a fist, albeit a slippery
one, around its civil liberties.

A good example to begin with
is the new smoking policy ap-
proved by Pittsburgh City Coun-
cil. We could also easily find hot
debate on the issue of whether

one should be forced to wear a,
seatbelt inan automobile. And '

how about legislation regarding
abortion? Should a girl, under the
age of legal consent, have to tell
her parents if she chooses to have
an abortion? Should the father be
informed?

By their own nature, these
trends are not limited to House
bills and the like. The ideas must
first come from people — every-
day people —— who are not law-
makers.

A man with a rather contorted
version of Victorian ethics con-
cerning sexuality was recently
brought to the public’s attention
when newspapers reported that
John Napoleon LaCorte, a
78-year-old New York millionare,
was offering $1,000 to women
who remained virgins until they
were 19. Numerous protests

that cause it," admitted Andy.
And as most "socia| outlets"
go, there's usually a time —- a
happy hour, if you will — when
more people go. Finals, maybe?
' "I haven't noticed an increase
[of students around that time],"
said David Kaufman. ”But
around exams, it does get noisy.”
Todd Fischer, who does not fre-
quent Hillman, said he has no-
ticed a pattern. ”I do not ‘come
that much. I only come in when
I have to look up information.
When I come in during finals and
midterms, there seems to be a lot
more people congregating on the
first and second levels. Seems like
it's more of a place for meeting,

T like bars.”

Despite all of this, there are
some devoted studiers that con-‘
tinue to pack their bookbags and
go to Hillman. ”The best time to
get anything‘ done is usually
Saturday or Sunday afternoon. I
find it's usually the quietest day.
That's when I usually get most of
my stuff done," said Randy Be-
lansky, who i_sn’t a student at Pitt.
’’Believe it or not, the worst time
is right around finals.” According
to a friend of Be|ansky's, "People
come here rather than go to a bar
because it's lighter, you can see
the people!” .

The third and fourth floors ap-
pear to be an exception to the
”social” atmosphere of the first
and second.

”Yeah,” said Brian Talbert. ”|t’s

~ really bad. [...] You come here for

it to be quiet. I always go to the
third [or] fourth f|oors.”

It seems logical that study
groups should go to the study
rooms, close the door and then
begin to talk. But sometimes this
is not possible. ”There’s always
a group study room with one per-
son,” said David Tanczos. ”That
person could find a quiet place.”

’’I live in a suite,” said Amy
Magaro, ”so it can be hard to
study there. Lots of times, I study
on the ground floor. But I find

that the higher floor you get to, _

the quieter it is.”

If only Hillman Library had a ,

few more floors 

forced him to withdraw his offer.
Nonetheless, whatever would
possess a man to hold a nation-

- wide virgin search is something

that I certainly would not equate
with a virtuous mind.

The question that came to my
mind was: How, exactly, did he
plan to go about this virgin vali-
dation? And one must also
wonder what kind of female
would respond to such an
inquiry.

The suppression of information
is also an issue that has been left

"to the discretion of governmen-

tal officials. At present, U.S.
newspapers have steadfastly em-
ployed resources available to
them in order to report the news.
Most importantly, though, they
have been permitted to.

In Texas, 2,000 people protest-
ed against the Amarillo Globe-
News for its ”shabby journalism”
and the claim that it ”shed a bad
light on our Panhandle commu-
nities.” .

An eight-part series on racism
against Hispanics in Hereford, a
town close to Amarillo, had in-
censed already fuming local com-
munity .leaders to the point at

Lower Level.

STOPPING TIME

which a funded campaign to
have the paper boycotted was in
operation.

The mayor of Hereford, Wes
Fisher, was concerned that such
investigative reporting could only
be a detriment to the area. Never
mind if what was reported was
true.

He joined forces with T. Boone
Pickens, a renowned oilman, and
together with the town, they lob-
bied the paper out of 500 of its
71,000 subscriptions and sever-
al pages of advertising.

The compelling story was such
a good example ofhow closely
intertwined politics and informa-
tion are. Politicians realize that
information and communication
are the biggestforces that exist.
Together, government and com-
munication push and pull each
other until some sort of balance
has been achieved. The result of

this ceaseless tugging manifests it-
self into what is conveyed to us
through the media.

A Hereford merchant had this
to say about the Amarillo Globe-
News:’ ”The paper should be a
positive force toward bringing
new economic development into
the Panhandle." I

It is distressing to those who
have chosen to work in the com-
munications field that many peo-
ple have‘ misconceptions about
what purpose the media serves.

The media is not self-serving,
nor is it designed to serve anyone
in particular. It is designed to
serve everyone, and by that, I
mean merely to inform. Granted,
the tremendous responsiblity of
sifting through so much informa-

' tion every day, access to that in-

formation and the way it is
presented is inherent to the
amount of influence the media
has over public reform.

It seems as though media could
be looked at as an ideology that
contradicts itself. While its pur-
pose is indeed to be objective,
never has such a neutrality been
known to cause such cataclysm.

Maybe people in towns like_ A

Hereford and in towns across

America simply do not like‘ ;

reality.

According to the executive edi-

tor of the Globe-News, ”Bottom'

line, it's a First Amendment issue.
 Does a paper have the right to
serve the public’s right to know

 whether it's negative or posi- _ 1‘

tive stories?”

Reality is both negative and
positive. It is the media's obliga-
tion to report both. Those who
work in the field are merely
devices. They do not control
what happens but report it to you.
What you see is what you get,
then. .

It is many a politician's dream
to have control over information
that is relayed to the public. Ideal-
ly, politicians lay their cards on
the table. It is the responsibility
of the media to pick up the cards

and display them for everyone.“

The game of communication can-
not be played with two cards up
anyone’s sleeve. And let's only
hope that most politicians play
with a full deck.
