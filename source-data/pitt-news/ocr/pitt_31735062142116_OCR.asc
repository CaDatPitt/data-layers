School R-Day
  Conducted, -as
L Usual - Quick

Next Tuesday's registration
day will, as far as the Univer-
, ‘sity is concerned, be exactly
- like the last one——classes as
usual, with the lounge of Fos-
, ter Memorial hall used at reg-
_v istration place.
. I A precinct ‘of Oakland’s local
draft board number 4, the Univer-
sity will register for selective ser-
vice all students 18 and 19 years old,
in addition to those students who
T have reached their twentieth birth-
_ day since last January ﬁrst.

As before, chief draft registrar
is ‘University registrar J. G. Quick.
He will be assisted by nine sub-
ordinate registrars: C. Stanton
Belfour, assistant extension di-

rector; Robert X. Graham, direct-
or of the Univer'sity News service;
Dr. John Geise, associate professor
of history; H. E. Daer, assistant

. bursar.
Philip E. Rush, assistant profes-
/, sor of electrical engineering; Ray-
..mond Coss, superintendent of build-
“ings and grounds, and Dr. George
W. Crouch, associate professor of
history. '
I These men, together with Mr.
Mr. .Quick, will ‘register students
* all day in thevsecond R-day to be
A * held on campus. First one was held
last February 16, at which time‘
well over -600 University faculty
9 ‘ members and students registered.
~ Two cards are to be ﬁlled out by

the registrar, who does all the writ-'

} fing. Recorded will be such things

A as the registrants name, address,

f place of birth, age in years, and
employment. .~ 1

Students are instructed to an-
swer “student—University of Pitts-
burgh,’_’ for the employment ques-

"tion. -
After certiﬁcation. of‘the infor-
mation, both registrar and regis-
trant will-sign the cards. One card
, y ‘will be sent immediately to the
 local draft goard of the registrant.
~ Thus students, no matter where
they live, or where their local draft
board meets, can register at the
University. .

The other card must be carried
by the registrant in compliance with
Federal draft regulations.

Fewer registrants are expected to

V sign up for next Tuesday’s regis-

i tration than did at last February's,
according to local draft board au-
thorities. -

For Editorials,

The front page of the Pitt News

is the most widely read, and the

least read and least liked were the

ivitamin study and First Aid ar-
"ticles offered by the News.

These were the two main and

more obvious conclusions of a Uni-

C vversity-wide reader-interest ‘ sur-

 ' -vey of the News made by journal-

’ . ism classes under the direction of

Robert X. Graham.

, Arranged in order from “liked

4 way you rated the “departments in
last semester’s Pitt News:

Dougan Leaving ,
Former and

Drill Coach 1

Captain Ramon C. Dougan, as-
sistant professor of‘military science
and tactics, is leaving the Univer-
sity in the near futurefor an un-
known destination. ‘

Captain Dougan will be replaced V

by 2nd Lt. John Finnerty who re-
ported here June 8 and is now on
leave. " I »

Captain Dougan. who was com-
missioned in 1934, came to the Uni-
versity in August of 1940.

He attended 7 the University of

Tennessee in 1928 and 1929. From
1929 to 1938 he served" in the army.
In 1938-1940 he studied at, V.P.l.

for his Bachelor of Science and Mas- -

ter of Science degrees. In 1940 he
he returned to active duty

He‘ is drillmaster for the Uni-
versity ROTC and marching bands
and faculty advisor for Pi Kappa
Alpha social fraternity.

Former Pitt . Assistant
Receives Promotion
James A. Shear, a graduate as-

sistant in physics at Pitt from 1939-:

to 1941,~has just been promoted
from second to first lieutenant in
the army air force.

Lieutenant Shear, now doing me-
teorology work, was in the first

,class to complete the Pitt course

in meteorology instituted by Don-

ald C. Bradford, seismologist in the ‘

department of Physics. He was
graduated from Westminster col-
lege in 1939. ‘

fraternity members and independ-
ents. '

On the other hand, much differ-
ence was shown between faculty
members and students.” In general
the editorials were read more wide-
ly, liked better, criticized less sharp-
ly by faculty members than by stu-
dents. _

While among the students it was
felt to some degree that the News
lacked objectivity and impar-
tiality in its presentation and
coverage of campus affairs, only
three faculty members scored the
News on this point.

While almost 50 students urged
more and longer Pittpourri’s with
more names and events. the total
faculty interest and appreciation of
the famous gossip department prov-
ed to be nil.

In addition. to registration for 2

the summer semester, which is in-
tended primarily for regular under-
graduates, registration for the sum-

mer sessions, for teachers and oth- 5

er adults will also be conducted on
July 26 and 27.

At this-time, students‘ will reg-
ister for the regular- six—weeks

session.

Meanwhile ﬁnal registration to-
tals in the, School of Law show a
50 percent increase over the sum-
mer term of '41, Dean E. A. Gil-
more announces.

In complying with the accelerat-
ed program asked for by the gov-
ernment and adopted by the Uni-
versity, the law school has in no

way changed its requirements for ~

entrance. . _ .
A college degree is still the pre-

requisite for admission.

The equivalent of a regular sem-
ester’s work will be completed in
the term extending from June 8
to September 2, added Dr. Gilmore,
and a student can, by continuous
attendance, complete the three-year
course in two calendar years.

The regular fall term will begin

Other suggestions for improv-

they were violent. Some asked for
more editorials, others asked that
the News editorials be curbed and
cut down. Several accused the

From a distance the wide glass

divide. one house from another and
which serve as a cellar storage

a dark, damp waste place.

Here is one example of the. prac-
tical Bauhaus designer.’Faced with
a limited amountof money, he. must
integrate a storage room, with some
of the functions of a cellar, into a
two storied building. And so he
kills two birds with one stone, mak-
ing the shed (which is not as con-
spicuous as some people might
think) act as a cellar and also as
a partition separating one house
from thernext, making for privacy.
Thus are provided storage and pri-

 Columnist: Elaine Kalwnwd 1 p
1 7.1 § As one of the more horrible examples of what war can’ do
 to sports we offer the current Pitt sports setup, which at
1, 1 {present consists of one tentative intramural program and com-
 pulsory physical education for engineers. Apparently it was
:: fgund that notonly can’t you get blood from a turnipgbut

neither: c_an you..get_anydes1re for sporting competition from

C ‘an jeng_ine,er' toiling through 8:30 to 5:30 classes. " 

; .2  is pleasant to be able to report, however, on the state. i

is pofjdthose engineers who, a short tilneda-fter their introduction
. torthe «compulsory physical education .,_courses,' were barely
able to crawl to their classes and were suffering from a vari-

» etyof ‘aches, pains, st_rains, and bruises. 1 .
 A j,   Now, twoweeks later, the boys have found to their own
}; ~ , surp'ri;se'’and elation that they are still alive and are even able
 to express some merit in the course. In fact, we even know-
one advanced ROTC man‘ who is exernpt from the course pub-
liclystate that he wished he could take it." it ' ' i
2 _ j interesting, at least fascinating, was the method used by
. Pitt track coach _Carl Olson and Army ditto Neal" N ovak for
._deciding'thc, outcome of a recent trackmeet between’ the two
institutions. ‘ . . - ‘
M , 4 ‘It was a grey day all around. Rainy, muddy, cold. No one
wanted .to_ run. So Novak and Olsonsat down and ﬁgured out
[ how the races and ﬁeld events would have come or had they
been held. If, for example, the Pitt relay team had turned in
a time of 3:54 against Penn State three weeks ago, and the
fastest the Army team had run all season was 4 :02, the event
_went to Pitt. * , =   1 . z  4
4 And so were all ‘the other events run off. Events which
..~ were close were decidedby the ﬂip of a_coin.
_  Notonly isthis system applicable‘ to track, but its appli-
’ ‘cations to other sports are practical, if not gruesome." T
,3 Let us suppose, for instance,that the Pirates had chosen
thissystem for ﬁnishing off their games in that fatal Septem-
ber of 1938. Obviously they would havewon the game with
Ch_icago, Pittsburgh would have had its pennant, Pie Traynor
would still" have his job, and Gabby Hartnett might still be
catching for Chicago. ‘ 3 . 1
 . _ - Scoring a; baseball. game by such a method should be sim-
pie. The two managers get together with their lineups and
pitching selections. Suppose Lefty Smith is going to pitch.
Smith, ﬁrst man up for the A team is a cinch for a left
 hand pitcher. Presuming that he would have four times at bat
we give him 0 for four. The next batter up, however, can mur-
der the port side pitch. So we give him three for four. And so
on down the line. The’hits are totaled, a proportionate number
of runs are added, and presto, the game is decided.
The system is practically faultless, unless of course the man-
agers get into too heated an argument whereupon the game
isliable to be called by the police.

Stickel, Once Paralyzed, 1 
Top Collegiate Traclcisteri

13y’1§LAINE KAHN
To_the recipes for success handed
out‘ by. assorted athletes, recipes
which have at various times” in-
cluded mothers, spinach, cigarettes,
and breakfast food, ‘must be added
that of Harold “Hap” Stickel, the
Pitt track star whdrecently climax-
ed three years of college competi-
tion by winning the coveted Nich-
olson, trophy, a trophy given annu-
ally to the most outstanding ath-
lete in the Central Intercollegiate
Meet. 4

Stickel who ranks as the best "

low hurdler in University history
and one of the better sprinters and
, 220 men is inclined to blame his
success on mental attitude.‘ “If
you make up your mind that you
can run,” says Stickel, “then you
can run.”
In Sticke1’s case it had to be a
triumph of mind over matter. F-or
9 at the Page of six he got into a ﬁght
A with another boy over a girl. Stick-
el lost the ﬁght and came pretty
near to losing his life as well when
his opponent sent him sprawling
ontoa concrete pavement. As a re-
sult of the fall his entire right side

was paralyzedand it was not until _

eight years later that he was able
to walk and run normally again.

Track is also a kind of family
tradition in the Stickel family.
Hap’s father, Charles Stickel, star-
1‘,ed_ at track, at both Carlisle and
Dickinson college and for:-many
yelar‘-Ts? held the record fo-r.the 100-
yard dash. I

“Hap” was, ‘IC4A iindoorisprint .

Ach.ampion.i11 L940, holds the Uni-

-- versity record in the low hurdles
and won the IC4A 220-yard low
hurdles title in .1940-41. He is also
:-the world record holder in the 45-»
yard dash,‘ a record he set at the
Knights of Columbus meet. In the
CIC- meet, for which he was award-
ed the Nicholson trophy, he broke
the 75-yard dash record in 7:5,
won the 60-yard low hurdle for
the second consecutive year, and
won the outdoor 220 low hurdle
with a mark of 23:4.

Stickel was also a member of the

football squad for three seasons..

But playing at left halfback, he was

always jpst sort of an understudy‘

for Edgar Jones, and never really
got a chance.

“Hap” thinks the biggest thrill—

in his college career came the day

    
 

ed the Nicholson cup. There w

Probably the bitterest ‘blow he
had to swallowwas in 1941 inithe
National Collegiates. He, had an
eight yard lead over his nearest
opponent in the ﬁnal hurdles when
he tripped and lost. And when the
same thing happened to him again
this year he began to wonder just
what the fates of this particular
meet had against him.

Stickel would ‘have graduated
this year, but for a switch in course
from Business Administration to
Engineering. That change cost him
exactly one-year, postponing grad-
uation until next September.

Mm Rad Sm»:

Testing of the air raid drill siren
system at 12:30 o'clock on three
days of last week would have been
graded 100 per cent had it not
been for some of the University's
more erudite elements.

The sirens were heard on all
ﬂoors of the Cathedral with the
exception of the ﬁfth (libraries)
and the seventeenth (faculty club).

No doubt, faculty members were
ma_l(lng too much noise with the
knives and forks to hear the sirens,
or were too interested in food to
leave their tables. Then, too, may-
be they didn’t want to leave the
table for fear that someone would
swipe their sugar, or put salt and

. pepper in the wrong places. (Back-
ground for this deduction: many
Persons are eating lunch at 12:30
o'clock in the faculty club.)

As for the library, no doubt per-
sons on that ﬂoor were concentrat-
ing deeply on studies and conse.
quently failed to hear the sirens.
Others may have been concentrat-
ing on the latest issues of Esquire
in the comfortable chairs in the
periodical and reference rooms.

As far as we’re concerned, it’s
just a case of Petty’s sirens being
louder than Geise’s.

Raid Plans . . .

continued from page one
Thursday night. The campus
blackout, however, will not affect
regularly enrolled day and eve-
ning students, as only the special
Engineering, Science and Man-
agement Defense Training class-

Ves are scheduled in University
buildings that night.

Electric light current will  shut
off at 8:30 o'clock in the various_
campusbuildings, and by 9:30 all
classes are to have been dismissed
and the buildings cleared. Joseph
S. Lambie, director of the ESMDT
courses, has asked instructors to
conduct classes so‘ long as daylight
permits. '

Members of the Cathedral air
raid headquarters will spend the
greater part of the night on campus
to observe details of the blackout
and to determine changes necessary
to conform to army regulations.

The campus blackout has been

 _ planned by a committee headed by

WALLACE S. PORTER
gives up commission

Pitt Graduate
Trains lor Air

Wallace Stevens Porter,’ who was
graduated from the University’s
School of Engineering in 1941, has
sacriﬁced a commission as ensign

to help meet the navy’s need for
aviators. He is one of seven men
who graduated as deck and engi-
neer officers at‘ the Naval Reserve
Midshipmen’s school, but gave up
their commissions and entered
ﬂight training as enlisted men be-
cause of the navy’s great need for
pilots. ‘

Porter said, upon entering the
Naval Reserve Aviation Base, “If
the navy needs pilots to fly the
planes which will carry the war to
the Axis, then I'll do my part.”

Raising ol Flag
Again to Honor
Men in Service

For the second time a ﬂag will
be raised to honor Pitt men in ser-
vice. And it will be the same ﬂag
which was hung during the last
war to honor service men of World
War I.

This Flag, which has been safe-
ly kept in a cupboard in State
Hall. was bi'ou_s.>,'!'it out at the re-
quest of Mrs. Gertrude Miller,
hostess in the Commons Room.
The 4,029 stars——still on it from
the last war-—will be replaced by
other blue stars, one for each Uni-
versity associate or student in the
service.

Gold stars will be used for those
men who die in service. There were
72 gold stars on the flag when Mr.
Raymond Coss, superintendent of
buildings and ground, took it out
for its second usage.

No deﬁnite arrangements have
been made ‘for the flag raising cere-
mony. Speculation was that per-
haps it will be similar to the gala
occasion in 1918 when twelve wom-
en students. dressed in middy blous-
es, carried it in military fashion.

the engineer ROTC students who
have had military science classes
since June 5.

Beginning at 8:30 o’clock the

Industrial Production
In Pittsburgh Rises

A rise of 1.1 points last week in E

Pittsburgh industrial production

was reported by Pitt’s Bureau of ‘f
Business Research, the increase re- .
' sulting mainly from higher bitumi— E
nous coal production and improved i

electric power sales.

Operating rate of the iron indus- 
try in this‘ district was advanced .3;

to 100 per cent of practical capacity,

the ﬁrst time since late April that 
the industry has worked at capacity. ,

The index of business activity‘ 

remained about the same, although
new motor car registrations re-

mained near zero 1eve.ls, and de- 0

partment store sales showed a de-
cline larger than seasonal factors
would warrant.

son is expected to assume his new
duties July 1. _

A native of Pittsburgh, Dr. Pear-

son_ served his internship at the

,Presbyterian Hospital here. He did’

post-graduate work at_ the Boston
Psychopathic Hospital, was ap-
pointed senibr psychiatrist there,
and taught psychiatry at Harvard
University both while in Boston and
at Foxborough. « ~

His ﬁrst task here will be to
organize a staff and to assemble
ﬁnal equipment in the new hospital.

Priority difficulties in recent
months have delayed the opening

of the 18-story structure, subject‘ of _

political controversy for the last
two state administrations, and un-
der construction for the past ten
years. '

According to the department of
welfare, the new institution will
contain 200 beds, and “the most
modern equipment for the housing
and treatment of adults and chil-
dren; laboratories, dispensaries.

classrooms for students, occupa-
tional and recreational therapy
rooms, offices and records rooms,
rooms for storage and departments
for general services." '

 .

   

on the recommendation of Dr. Cret,
the walls also are to be of a yellow-
cream color. Similar plastic orna-
ments are to appear between upper
and lower panels of the door. A

. A typical French ceiling of plain

painted plaster will be ornament- .

ed with an original crystal chan-
delier which will be selected by
Mr. Ketterer.

Side wall recesses are to have
arched tops and are to be prepared
with mouldings for future wall
paintings.

The hardwood parquet ﬂoor is to
be decorated with a pattern like the
one used in the Palace of Versailles.

Green satin curtains will be
hung at the four windows. To har-
monize with them, the furniture is
to be of mahogany upholstered
with green leather. Bronze orna-
ments will be.used to. decorate the
furniture.
