fairs. has been appointed vice

office for Public .-\ffairs.

Before seeking a replacement
for Kobosky. the Chancellor has
appointed a task force to study
a possible reorganization. reor-
ientation. or reassignment of the
()ffice’of Student Affairs.

In a recent memorandum. the
Chancellor said that he appoint-
ed Van Dusen as Secretary in
order to have  senior admin-
istrative officer who is familiar
with the functionings of the Un-
iversity and who can represent
the L'niversity before many of
our const_ituenci_es" on the staff.

Van Dusen is responsible for
assisting the Board of Trustees,
maintaining relations with other
institutions of higher education,
and coordinating the efforts of
the Boards of Visitors.

versity in 1956. He served for

ment. From 1959-1967 he was

Student Affairs while the spe-
cial task force, makes its investi-
gation.

The Chancellor gave the fol-
lovving ‘reasons for the special
study;

"The present administrative
structure has existed in its gen-
eral framework since the time
when Pitt was far less large and
complex than it is today.

"Furthermore. while the per-
sonnel of Student Affairs have
worked most loyally and effec-
tively over the past years. the
present reorganization and
change of senior personnel in
other areas of the University

KOBOSKY: Promoted

present a unique opportunity at
this time to make this investiga-
tion."

The task force will consider
such questions as whether the
office of Student Affairs might
be more appropriately assigned
to the office of the Provost and
how to improve services to com-

muters, graduate students, for-»

eign students and other special
groups.

Chairman of the task force is

Aid App ‘ill Awaits State Action

by STEVE LUBETSKY
A delegation from Pitt travell-
ed to Harrisburg Thursday in an
attempt to persuade the State

Legislature to allocate more
funds to the University.
Dennis Concilla. Programs

Commissioner of the Student As-
sociation tSAt. who was among
the representatives. described
the issue as "mainly a question
of funding higher education."
The Legislature inquired about
the possibility of raising the tui-
tion to what it would cost if Pitt
were not state-related. Those
who could not afford to pay this
amount would receive state aid.

“The problem with this,” Con-
cilla said, “is that such an ar-
rangement breeds mediocrity.
The only source of revenue
would then be the students, and
to compensate for the loss, en-
rollment would have to go up.
That would result in overcrowd-
ed conditions, and the level of
teaching would decline.”

A major concern of the Leg-
islature was whether Medical
students should qualify for State
loans. "The belief of the legisla-
tors." Concilla explained. “is
that many Med students take
advantage of loans and then
leave the stateifollowing gradu-

“Actually,” he went on, “only
$25,000 is paid by the state. Of‘
$170,000 in aid, the bulk of it de-
rives from Federal grants.

"Furthermore." he pointed out.

Among the proposals that the
legislators suggested was the no-
tion of deferred tuition. Accord-
ing to Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var. who attended the hearing.
such a program would enable
students to pay tuition over an
extended period.

“We have started a staff study
of deferred tuition," Posvar told
the Pitt News The mentioned
the School of Medicine as the
“logical first place" to try such
aplan.

Joseph G. t‘olangello. .Jr..
l)irector of News and Publica-
tions. said "the adopted budget
depends on an increase tuition.
or funds from the Common-
wealth. which is unlikely.

“The State pledged a grant of
5542.3 million which is much
less than we need. Furtherinore.
the money isn‘t expected before

According to sources in Har-
risburg. no new developments
concerning the State income tax
have occured at the time of the

Opposed In Letters, McFadden

Bypussed As Actiiig Exec.

text of ACWO memo, see

page four.

A pair of letters questioning
his qualifications for the job may
have prevented Dan Mcl<‘adden‘s
appointment as acting Vice
t‘hancellor for Student .~\ffairs.

The letters. received by Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar last week.
charged that McFadden had lit-
tle credibility among women and
blacks of the l'niversity coin-
miiiiity.

One of the memos, unsigned,
presented the views of the Advi-
sory Council on Women's Oppor-
tunities (ACWO). The contents of
the second letter, from the Black
Action Society, were not revealed.

The Chancellor belittled the
importance of the letters. saying
that we decided on our
course of action before the sec-
ond memorandum was received.“

Posvar said that he had been
“in clear and direct communi-
cation with representatives of the
black community and the wom-
en’s sector” prior to the receipt
of either letter.

“Their views were presented in
a constructive. polite manner."
said Posvar.

The Chancellor decided that
Bernard Kobosk_\‘. newly-appoiiit—

that position. pending the report
of" the task force.

McFadden was thought by
many to have the best chance of
being named acting Vice Chan-
cellor, due largely to his exper-
ience in Student Affairs. Kobos-
ky recommended McFadden’s
appointment to the Chancellor.

"That was the only alterna-
tive I saw.“ said Kobosky of his
recommendation.

McFADDEN: Profesfed

The Chancellor elected to ig-
nore that recommendation.
though professing a “ very
high regard for the abilities of
McFadden.“

Posvar denounced the letters,

calling them indicative of a
“misunderstanding of the way
responsible people deal with

each other.”

"For those letters to have been
written was completely unnec-
essary and unfortunate." he said.

The AC\\'() memo listed no
specific grievances against Mc-
Fadden. saying only that his ap-
pointment would be unaccepta-
ble to women and blacks.

Kobosky denied that his ‘top
aide was either anti-women or
anti-black, saying that McFad-
den has done “. .’a hell of a
job” in fulfilling the role of Ex-
ecutive Assistant Vice Chancel-
lor.

"It is sometimes unpleasant.
sometimes difficult for the num-
ber two man to be shot at."
said Kobosky.

The (_.'hancellor‘s Advisory Committee. a group of student
leaders. forwarded to Governor Milton Shapp the names of five
students. one of whom will be selected to serve as a member of
Pitts Board of Trustees.

The students include John. Baginski. Dennis Concilla. Lenny
I-ilavonic. Sharon Novak. and Carl Van Horn. One of them will
be selected by the Governor. after personal interviews with the

five candidates.

Governor Shapp recently decided to name a student to each
of the three state-related universities‘ boards. He has expressed
the hope that the three students selected will participate actively

. on their respective boards forfour years. i » -

26th Amendment Gives Youth Vote

by RON LOZOWSKI

The 18-year-old vote became a
reality last week when Ohio be-
came the 38th state to ratify the
26th amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.

(The Constitution requires that
all amendments be ratified by
three-fourths of the states.)

The new amendment states:
"The right of citizens of the Unit-
ed States. who are 18 years of
age or older. to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United
States or by any state on account
of age."

A June Newsweek article noted
that this will provide for the en-
franchisement of 11.4 million
Americans.

Figures offered in a March,
1970, speech by Senator Edward
Kennedy before a Senate Subcom-
mittee pointed out that this will
represent approximately an eight
per cent increase in the eligible
electorate.

According to census statistics.
about half of the new voters are
receiving some type of higher ed-
ucation.

A recent Harris survey indi-
cated that 72 per cent of pre-
viously qualified voters aligned
themselves with a particular par-
ty. However. only 52 per cent of
those in the 18-20 age bracket
voiced party inclinations.

Among the youths favoring a
particular party, the Democrats

held almost a 3-1 edge. The ratio
of Democrats to Republicans for
the rest of the electorate was 5-3.

Another Harris poll showed
Senator Edmund Muskie the fav-
orite presidential candidate
among 18-year-olds. Muskie was
the pick of 49 per cent. compared
to 22 per cent who preferred
President Nixon.

Joe Reppert. press secretary to
Senator Robert Dole. chairman of
the Republican National Commit-
tee. was asked whether the new
amendment would hurt the Presi-
dent‘s chances of being re-elected
in 1972.

Reppert replied, “I don’t think
it will.” He added that, perhaps
as the campaign progresses, the

voters will become more aware
of what Nixon has done for the
economy and how the President
is ending the war. In view of
youth's concern with the latter is-
sue, Reppert said that the new
amendment could prove to have
positive political ramifications
for the Nixon administration.

A Harris survey showed that 76
per cent of 18-20 year olds were
In favor of withdrawing all U.S.
troops from Vietnam by the end of
1971.

In Senator Kennedy's March.
1970. speech before the Senate
Subcommittee on Constitutional
Amendments. he presented statis-
tics showing that one-third of our
Vietnam forces is under 21.

Such issues will meet the youth
test in the forthcoming elections.

A major problem. according to
a Kennedy aide. will be getting
the young people registered in
time to vote in the upcoming elec-
tions. In the past. young would-be
voters have experienced confu-
sion as to how and where to regis-
ter.

Nevertheless. it appears that
the young will vote when given the
opportunity. In a recent special
primary election to fill a Mary-
land congressional seat. only 17
per cent of the registered voters
cast their ballots. More than 35
per cent of the under-21 group
participated in the election.

why, how & where to live
IN MEXICQ ..

If you’ve been considering living in
Mexico, Why, How & Where to Live in
Mexico is one book you shouldn’t be
without. Combining her own opinions
with purely objective material, Jane
Thompson Cobbe has ﬁlled page after
page with valuable information, recom-
mendations, and comparisons.

Included in this informative book are
precise instructions for securing any one
of the resident statuses, exact prices of
houses and food, and accounts weighing
the pros and cons of ﬁfteen cities and
towns. Descriptions of the scenic
beauties, climates and sources of criter-
tainment of each location are set against
pertinent historical backgrounds as well
as present-day impressions, giving the
reader an all-around picture.

Mexico is shown to be an excellent

country in which to relocate, especially
for the person of moderate means.
Without frequent resort to Superlatives,
the author illustrates the Republic’s many
advantages, particularly in the face of the
inflation in the States. She tells of her
own experiences and those of friends and
acquaintances which give useful pointers
and warn of possible pitfalls.

If you want more details on any aspect
of becoming a Mexican resident or about
Mexico itself, there is a list of reading

Covert Capitulation
Reigns in Cathedral

Chancellor Wesley Posvar must pretend he’s above politics.

  
  

The Chancellor cannot afford to succumb overtly to political
pressures. If he yields under duress to interest groups. he forfeits
the image of the statesmanlike decision—maker which is essential to
his mystique. .

On the other hand, the Chancellor cannot dare to resist certain
pressures, particularly when the arm-twisters happen to be women
or blacks. And when blacks and women join forces. the Chancellor
courts disaster if he doesn‘t give in.

Occasionally, the game is difficult to play, even when the
Chancellor is an astute Political Scientist who appreciates the tac-
tical importance of covert Capitulation. ‘

Last week, for example, blocs of women and blacks placed Dr.
Posvar in an embarrassing situation by expressing in memos views
which apparently had been conveyed more politely in prior conversa-
tions.

The memoranda — one from the Advisory Council on Women‘s
Opportunities (ACWO) and the other reportedly from the Black Ac-
tion Society (BAS) — advised against naming Dan McFadden Acting
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. The ACWO memorandum also
urged the establishment of a committee to investigate the future of

I the Student Affairs area. ‘

V Chancellor Posvar has decided that Dan McFadden will not be
named Acting Vice Chancellor. He has also decided to appoint a
committee of the sort recommended by the AC W0.

“We decided on our course of action before the second memor-
andum was received,” Posvar told the_ Pitt News. “for those letters
to have been written was completely unnecessary and unfortunate. ”

If Dr. Posvar says the memos didn‘t influence his judgment. they
did not influence his judgment.

Clearly, however, Chancellor Posvar heeded the advice of women
and blacks who conveyed their feelings in personal conversations, and
later, in memos which the Chancellor himself found juvenile.

Moreover, the Chancellor disregarded the advice of Vice Chan-

cellor Bernard Kobosky, who strongly recommended that McFadden

be appointed Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.

Kobosky considers it unfair for McFadden to be singled out and
attacked by women and blacks. As Kobosky’s Executive Assistant.

_ McFadden has functioned as the fall guy — often bargaining to pave

the wayfor a compromise by Kobosky. But they have worked as a
team; basically, only their roles have differed.

, Gail Hornstein of the ACWO denies that the ACWO memo con-
stituted a personal slap at McFadden. But if the ACWO memo was
based on principle, why is the ACWO content with Kobosky’s stay-
ing on as Acting Vice Chancellor — the arrangement finally chos-
en by Posvar? If McFadden was not acceptable, why is Kobosky any
more so?

The Pitt News is not encouraging the ACWO and the BAS to
condemn Kobosky. But. in the absence of consistency. we must
suspect that the memos may have been prompted by personal ani-
mosities or a desire for a display of force.

The Pitt News fears that McFadden has been penalized for
performing his role as Executive Assistant a little too well. We trust
that Chancellor Posvar will play his role as the statesmanlike deci-
sion-maker a bit more credibly in the future.

ACWO Note: 'Vigorous Opposition’

(Editor's note: The following is the
text of a letter sent to the Chancellor,
written by a member or members of the
Advisory Council on Women's Opportuni-
ties (ACWU). The letter was unsigned.
The Student Affairs Task Force mention-
ed is a part of the ACWO. It is chaired by
Gail Hornstein, who will be a senior this
fall.)

It has come to our attention that the
appointment of Mr. Daniel McFadden as
acting Vice Chancellor for Student Af-
fairs is imminent. Before this appoint-
ment is finalized. we must make clear to
you our most vigorousopposition.

This coming year will be a critical

one at the University. and it is imperative
that if the position must be filled immed-

iately it be filled by an individual with
some credibility among women and
Blacks. Mr. McFadden has credibility
with neither of these groups. In no way
does the ACWO believe that any steps
will be taken toward Affirmative Action
in the Student Affairs area should this
appointment be made.

The preliminary investigation of the
Student Affairs Task Force questions the
efficiency of a Student Affairs area as
much. We therefore recommend that a
study committee investigate the entire
structure of Student Affairs to determine
its future. We consider this an ‘emergen-
cy situation and request an immediate
meeting with you.

 

Late Fee Enforcement Peeves Victim

Editor.

With a good day in the steel mill. every-
thing running smoothly, my father may make
$25 clear with bo_nus. but you can be assured he
worked damn hard for every dollar. I have to
work a day and a-half for that much since
when I work in the mill 1 get a lesser-paying
job. ,

The Student Accounts office makes $25 clear
every time a person brings in their tuition or
room and board payment after the due date.
They don’t work hard for it. It takes about two
minutes. They merely require that the poor girls
collecting fees enforce the late fee.

Surely the center must have a better means
of collecting payment as not to have a lot of
people owing a lot of money which would sure-

' ly happen.

Nonetheless, I feel they are going about it
all wrong. The student knows he must pay be-
fore he starts his classes. Why not set the due
date a day before class. Without a paid invoice
how could someone get into a class?

I received my academic invoice for spring

and summer sessions at the end of the fall term.
Of course I put my summer session invoice aside
with full intentions of paying it before summer
session. ‘

Two days late was over a week before class-
es and also when I walked. up to pay my sum-
mer invoice. Twelve days before classes began
the payment was due. ‘

I asked who I could talk to. unfortunately.
and was sent to a Mr. Passerelli. He informed
me that it was my own fault and that all I
could do was pay the $25. as he marked “late
payment. $25.00“ on my invoice. I could have
saved both of us the time and trouble by writ-
ing that myself.

When someone takes $25 out of my pocket.
I want to know why. and then I want to know
what I can do to prevent it from happening

iwithout hurting either party. At the moment. I

have a sore pocket.

If only one reader reads this and learns what
not to do about a late fee. then I have not
wasted my time.

Carnal Knowledge;

Script Lacks Cohesiveness

by CINDY MORGAN
Entertainment Editor

When a picture has a strong
director such as Mike Nichols.
a cast of top actors and actress-
es. and a title like Carnal Know-
ledge, how could you help
but create a film that would
have the public flocking to the
box office?

The trick is to keep them
flocking. Jules Feiffer. the auth-
or of Little Murders, wrote the
script. and unfortunately, this
story suffers from many of the
same problems that movie did.

It lacks cohesiveness and bogs
down in places, only to be res-
cued by an occasional fine piece
of acting or directing. The dia-
logue sometimes is trite, _ and
the plot borders on the unbeliev-
able.

The story opens in a 1930‘s
college mixer between Amhurst

Simon’s Latest: How Suite

by STEVE ZYCH

How do you argue with the

Despite pans by many so—call-

to be the last of the red-hot play-

as a film scripter—as can be seen
from the enormous success of his

tured at the Gateway.

According to the latest Var-

almost $2 million in less than
two months——certainly a pheno-

Pitt’s Lewis Proposes
()r;_mii.izri,tioii. Of Frill

Brisclmll

by JANICE BUCCIG ROSS!

Panther baseball coach Bob
Lewis. has proposed the organi-
zation of fall workouts in base-
ball.

These workouts. which would
be open to all students wishing
to try out for the ‘72 team.
would begin approximately one
week after the start of classes in
September and end in a months
time. depending on weather con-
ditions.

"These practices in the fall
would be great because they
would be held earlier in the

year and they would be conduct-
ed outside." stated Lewis.

“This would give me a better
opportunity to see what we have
and it would give the guys a
better opportunity to show what
they can do."

Regular try otils and practice‘

sessions begin in March and

run until the end of that month.

Workouts are usually confin-
ed to the Trees Hall gym and
the Field House due to the late
winter weather.

The ‘T1 season practice ses-
sions were typical of past base-
ball workouts at Pitt. Due to
snow. rain. and unseasonally
cold weather. Lewis and his
baseball squad were able to hold
practices out of doors only twice
during the entire month of
March.

the rest of the work outs were
conducted indoors where Lewis
feels “it is difficult to judge
the ability of the players — af-

COACH BOB LEWIS

The probability of the suc-
cessful organization of fall work-
outs is largely dependent on the
availability of field space. The
field that would be used‘ for
baseball practice is the All-Pur-
pose Field behind Trees Hall.
This. however. is the same field
used for soccer practice.

“The fall practices wouldn't
cost the University anything,“
said Lewis. “We have bats and
balls left over from last season
that we can use.

"Last year’s players are en-

thused about the idea — they
would be glad to come back
and work out." he said. "The

big problem is field space and
the decision rests with Mr. .\ly-
slinski tPitt Athletic Director
Casimir M_vslinski i."

The University has received
a grant of $9.655 from the Alle-
gheny Regional Planning Coun-
cil of the Governors Justice
Commission to develop a propo-
sal for an undergraduate and
graduate program in the Admin-
istration of Justice.

The finished proposal will be
submitted to the Governors Jus-
tice Commission. according to
Arthur Fedel. executive associate

dean of Pius School of Geiieral'

Studies. The School will super-
vise development of the pro-
gram.

“The proposed educational

plan will encompass the entire
process of social order and pub-
Iic justice," Fedel said. ‘‘It will

 

be designed to include police,
courts and corrections, so that
the entire system of justice be-
comes the object of study."

Fedel said that the final pro-
posal will include a provision
for acceptance of transfer stu-
dents from the t'oinmunity (‘ol-
lege of Allegheny (Tounty after
they have completed the course
offerings in the field of justice
at that institution.

Other Schools at Hit in-

posal will be the Graduate

School of Law. School of Busi-

ness. and the graduate School of

At a meeting of the Student

Thursday. Chancellor Posvar
suggested that three tindergrad—

The committee. which felt that
five should be named. balked at

The Chancellor said there will
be no search for a Vice Clian—

the Task force completes its
work. He said he hoped it
would turn in its report by early
fall.

The Chancellor has also an-
nounced the appointment of Dr.

His web is spun so fine and wide
as to entrap the full spectrum of
human emotion, and with crafts-
manlike character actors as Wal-
ter Matthau (who plays the male
lead in all three vignettes). Mau-
reen Stapleton, Lee Grant. and
newcomer Barbara Harris to re-
create the successful stage roles
(George C. Scott and Maureen
Stapleton wowed ‘em on Broad-
way in the stage version), it's
little wonder the film is a winner.
