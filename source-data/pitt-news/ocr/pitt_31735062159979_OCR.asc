Legislature
Grants Total
$5,896,000

In the ﬁnal days of the longest
session in the history of the Gen-

tors approved the governor’s ap-
propriation for Pitt’and the West-
ern Pennsylvania Psychiatric In-
stitute.

396,0-00 and the Institute was
awarded $2,500,000. Both institu-
tions are only partially supported
by the state. The appropriations
are for the biennium ending May
31, 1953. ' I

Pittsburgh legislators s t a v e d
off a drive to reduce the amount.
An earlier cut of one million from
the Penn State appropriation was
restored at the same time the Pitt
grant passed. State, completely
supported by taxes, received $17,-
105,000 for the biennium.

Other legislation affecting the
University was the controversial
Loyalty Oath Bill. Under its pro-
visions the Chancellor must sub-
mit a yearly report on the “loyal-
ty” of the faculty.

Hartman Will Gives  
Library $75,000

The late Galen C. Hartman, a life-time resident of Pitts-
burgh, awarded the University Library $75,000 in his will.

Under the terms of the will, the money will be used to
purchase non-technical ‘books. The will also speciﬁed that

all books must be for the advance-
ment of culture and must be writ-
ten in the English language.

Books purchased with this money
will be marked with the Galen C.
Hartman Library Fund Bookplate,
a design derived from the Hart-
man family coat-of-arms.
, Although a University of Mich-
igan alumnus, Mr. Hartman had
for years shown a strong interest
in Pitt.

In November 1945, Mr. Hartman
established the library fund and
made frequent donations of money
as well as books from his own
library. During his life he donat-

ed a total of $4,895 to the library
fund.

Hoopsters Are After
. Fourth Victory

BY BORIS WEINSTEIN

Another representative from the Ivy
League——Pitt’s most recent hunting grounds
for its hoop action—comes to Memorial Field
House tomorrow night to battle Doc Carl-
son’s Panthers.

three straight to Minnesota, Michigan State, and
Michigan, hopes to snap a ﬁve game winless streak
against the mediocre Pitts. A

Tip off is 9 p.m. following the Pitt-Michigan
wrestling matches scheduled for 7:15.

Ivy League Poisonous

In three previous appearances against the Ivy
leaguers, the Panthers have managed to win only
once. Columbia was an upset victim in the dedi-
cation game thriller, 65-64———snapping their 32-
game winning streak.

Since then, however, Penn and Yale have best-
ed the Blue-and-Gold on the Field House floor.
Pitt's record now is 3-3.

‘Coach Franklin “Cappy” Cappon’s problem this
season has been to replace Mike. Kearns, high-
scoring forward who'netted 301 points last year,
and to ﬁnd a capable “bench.” .

Four Starters Return

Cappon, though, has four of his last year’s
starting quintet to go against the Panthers, led by
Captain Chuck DeVoe and Dave Sisler.~ .

. DeVoe and Sisler, son of baseball’s Hall of Fam-
er George Sisler, were runnersup to Kear-ns.

Carlson ﬂoors the same starting ﬁve that has
appeared in all six previous games. So far, Mickey
Zernich, 6-2 junior, leds all Panther point-getters
from the ﬁeld. Zernich has dumped 82 points
through the cords for a 13.6 average.

Probably the worst game that Pitt played was

r the Penn State affair in the Steel Bowl ﬁnal. The
Panthers. couldn’t work the ball through State’s
tight zone defense, and they had just as much
trouble scoring from outside.

Feb. 1946. He had been serving as

Dr. Nutting became dean of the

Loyalty Oath Bill Now
Part of Legal Code

The long and bitter battle over the Pechan Loyalty Oath
bill came to an end shortly before the Christmas vacation
when the General Assembly enacted a much-amended version

of the original bill into law.

The law as it now stands rep-
resents neither a complete vic-
tory for its supporters — largely
veterans groups——nor a complete
defeat for its opponents, mainly
educational‘ organizations.

After leaving the legislature the
measure went to Governor Fine
for his approval. He was strongly
urged by leading educators and
many of the state's newspapers to
veto the bill. The governor signed
the measure and added his praise
to his signature.

The measure requires that all
state employes and elective of-
ficials sign an oath that they do

For those fortunate enough to
get inside the Nixon these even-

New Year’s treat. From Tennessee
Williams has come The Rose Tat-

ma, richly lined with lusty humor
and brimmed with an aliveness
not before associated with this

For Williams this is a welcome

He has discarded the tragic un-

and bursting with life.

Principally, The Rose Tattoo is
the story of Seraﬁna della Rose.
Widowed of a handsome and
amoral truck driver, she dedicates
her life to an urn containing his
ashes. Her dedication is compli-
cated by rumors that her hus-
band has not been faithful—which
she steadfastly denies—and by her
blossoming 15-year-old daughter,
Rosa, who suddenly discovers the
Navy. Finally, confronted with
unquegtionable proof of her hus-
band’s inﬁdelity, Seraﬁna takes a
new and loutish truck driver lov-
er.

All this Daniell Mann has stag-
ed with warmth and a- hugely
comic affection. With the aid of
Boris Aaronson’s arresting, real-
istic setting, and some of the sea-

ated a shimmering masterpiece.

The actors at work here are all

spectacular performances. Miss

Editor

Not even nosy newspapermen can pry loose from the
University the name of the new head football coach. The
top secret here at Pitt still remains safe from the fourth

estate. ‘

There have been no releases from the Athletic De-
partment regarding the .vacant coaching post, but it
would seem that by this time more work has been done
,than appears on the surface.

So far the Athletic Department
has released the names of six men
who were interviewed by the Ath-
letic Committee. They were four
of Captain Tom’s assistants and
Dr. Eddie Baker, head football
coach at Tech, and John Michelo-
sen, ex-Steeler coach.

Many Interested in Post

Before the holidays it was an-
nounced that the list of interested
persons in the head mentor job at
Pitt numbered more than 50. Un-
doubtedly the list has become
longer by this time. But the Uni-
versity has taken a policy of not
divulging these names.

This is perfectly logical since
there are probably many foot-'
ball coaches at other universi-
ties who have applied for the
job and don’t desire to jeopar-,.
dize their present positions.

Rumors about town claim that
such men as Earl Blaik of ‘Army,
Harvey Harman of Rutgers, Bernie
Crimmins of Notre Dame, Biff
Glassford of Nebraska, and Lowell
Dawson of Michigan State have
the inside track on the coaching
position at Pitt. '

Fesler Could Be Had

It seems that an excellent man
for the post has been forgotten in
the mad game of quessing. He is
Wes Fesler, former Pitt coach and
now head coach at Minnesota.

You can’t blame Fesler for
leaving Pitt for more money at

Ohio State. But when he got
into hot water at Ohio, he left
for Minnesota and a contract
offering him less money.

I have never met Fesler but
from talking to University sports
ﬁgures I have never heard a bad
remark about him. He was also
the ﬁrst non-alumnus to leave the
University with an air of gratitude
being expressed by the Athletic
Committee and Alumni Associa-
,tion. ‘

Fesler Still Liked

In fact on the way back from
the Michigan State game when
several University sportsmen
found out that genial Fesler was
staying with his Gopher bunch in
a Detroit hotel, they immediately
taxied from the train station to
the hotel to wish Wes luck andto
chat with him.

I wonder if Pitt would har-
bor thoughts of having Fesler
return to the University as head
coach. The Athletic Committee
could do worse in its selection.

i4ll-State Joe Resutek

Once with Champions

BY GEORGE MEHAFFEY

If past performances are any criteria, the Pitt frosh
dribblers have a real winner in the genial person of Joe

Resutek.

The 6-3, basketeer acquired the winning habit while

playing for Johnstown Catholic’s state champion basketball

team in 1950.
The J ohnnies, under the

expert tutelage of Coach Joe

Majer, went undefeated in 24
Catholic League contests; then
added two more against tourna-
ment opponents, Pittsburgh Cen-
tral Catholic and Reading. They
also, polished off western PIAA
champion Farrell, 34-31, for a
phenomenal season chart of 27-0.

Was All-State

Because of their consistent scor-
ing and playmaking ability, Resu-
tek and teammate Ed Pavlick were
placed on the All-State Catholic
basketball squad. Incidently, Pav-
lick is now teaming with “Big
Joe” for Dodo Canterna’s Junior
Jungle Cats and the two are room-
mates at the new Field House.

Resutek’s biggest thrill took
place in the ﬁnale tournament
game against Reading when he
tallied 21 points to lead his team
to a 42-39 victory and the title.

Hopes To Coach

When asked what he thought
about the Field House, Joe said,
“It is the largest and most beauti-
ful basketball pavilion that I have
ever seen; why, you could put
Johnstown War Memorial inside
of it.”

The former Johnstown star is
taking Secondary Education at Pitt
and may do a bit of coaching on
the side after his court days are
over. .

In ,Miehigan Test Tomorrow

By DON SCHURMAN

Guarding a two-meet win-
ning streak, Pitt’s undefeated
wrestlers square-oﬁ against a
powerful Michigan squad tomor-
row night in their ﬁrst major test
of the young mat season.

Starting at 7:15 p.m. at the Field
House, the meet will be a prelim-
inary attraction to the Pitt-Prince-
ton basketball game.

So far this season, Pitt has
whipped Indiana State Teachers,
31-2, and Yale, 15-11, in dual com-
petition. Competing in the Wilkes-
Barre tournament over the holi-
days, they ﬁnished second to Le-
high, 26-23.

Pitt Out For Revenge

On the other hand, tomorrow's
meet is_ Michigan’s ﬁrst of the sea-
son although they carry an unde-
feated ten-game streak from last
year. “This year,” as Coach Rex
Peery analyzes, “Michigan should
be even better.”

Also runnersup in the Big Ten
last year, the Wolverines will
throw ﬁve rugged veterans against
the Panthers—two in the heavier
weights where Pitt has shown a
decided weakness.

Pitt’s main hopes for avenging
last year’s 16-11. defeat at Ann
Arbor lie in the ﬁve lightest weight

‘divisions where they are unde-

Miller To Face Champ

0 Here, Harold Miller, 130-pounds,

and George Matthews, 137-pounds,
should meet the roughest opposi-
tion. Miller meets Larry Nelson,
123-pound Big Ten champ last
year; and Matthews meets Jack
Gallon who, as a 130-pounder, de-
feated Miller last year and was
runnerup in the Big Ten.

Sophomores Hugh Peery, 123-
pounds, and Chuck Uram, r 147-
pounds, and freshman Joe Solo-
mon, 157-pounds, are Pitt’s best
chances for scoring points.

The “beef” of Peery’s young
lineup—made up of two freshmen,
four sophomores, and two juniors
——will face Michigan’s.big guns.

Gridder Hunter on Team

In the 177-pound class, sopho-

Art (Moose) Dunne. \

Freshman Willard McMarlin,
167-pounds, will compete in his
ﬁrst collegiate meet against Wol-
verine Captain Bud Holcombe.
McMarlin sat out the ﬁrst two
meets with an injured knee.

Disappointingly, only one foot-
ball player, 177-pound Harold
Hunter, has come out to practices
-giving Pitt much-needed
strength in the heavier divisions.

Hiroo Mukai, English born Japanese student in an Amer-
ican college, has a problem today.
The 32-year-old former news reporter for the Kyodo
Syndicate is worried about his accent.

Cap and Gown
Relics Found

The group of students trying to
revive the defunct Cap and Gown
club has -found a gold mine in a
dusty old locker in a hallway near
804 C1.

The locker was jammed full of
souvenirs of annual all-male var-
itty shows put on in the past by
the club. Everything from old pro-
grams to ﬁnancial records and
complete books and music was
cached in the locker, forgotten
since the last show in. 1947.

Offers of support from Cap and
Gown alumni have been reported
and the group is enthusiastic
about the possibilities of re-ac-
tivating the club.

Next meeting of the C&G re-
organizers, will be open to all
students, Wednesday, Jan. 9, at
4:30 p.m. in 832 C1:

Tht drive here was sponsored
by the YM&WCA, in cooperation
with a city-wide drive. _

The clothes were shipped direct
to Pusan, free of charge, by Pa-
ciﬁc Airlines. Th e railroads
throughout the country also gave
their help.

Mrs. Edna T. Batz, director of
tht YWCA, said. “The concern ex-
pressed through the generosity of
the faculty and students bears out
the idea that we were not too busy
with our own affairs to think of
others in desperate need.”

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. headed a
nation-wide drive directed by the
United Nations.

 

Canterhury’s rMeet

The Canterbury club will meet
for a dinner on January 8 at 6
p.m. in the parish house of the
Church of the Ascension, Ells-
worth Ave. and Neville St.

' Following the dinner there will
be a talk by the Reverend Father
Joseph Wittekofski of St. Mary’s
Episcopal Church of Charleroi, Pa.

$ But it’s not his English that con-

cerns him most; rather, it’s his
own native Japanese. For Mukai,
born in London, learned to speak
English long before his own lan-
guage.

“Someday I will speak perfect
Japanese,” he said.

Selected as one of 500 students
from over 7,000 applicants to study
in the U.S., Hiroo came to Pitt by
the occupation army’s choice.

Here Five Months

Here only five months, Hiroo has
made some very interesting ob-
servations of the American people.

“You just can’t generalize about
Americans,” he commented. “They
are friendly on the surface but
generally very diﬂicult to get
to know.”

“Americans are supposed to
have many friends, but so many
of them are lonely,” he added.

“More Japanese get drunk than
Americans,” he announced, “and
I haven’t had time to study the
American women at all yet.”

Taking Journalism

In relation to his occupation as
news correspondent during World
War II he is taking courses in
journalism here.

Comparing Japanese and
American -education, Hiroo said,
“One thing of which I do .not
particularly approve are the nu-
merous examinations in Ameri-
can schools. In Japan we have
only one a semester.”

He spoke of the numerous
changes in Japan since the war.
With a smile he told of the new
place that women have obtained

in various occupational ﬁelds.
“But,” said Mukai, “I still believe
that a woman’s place is in the
home.”

Surprised at Mac's Recall

While Mukai wouldn’t comment
on MacArthur, he admitted that
he was surprised at his recall.

“In general,” he added, “the
Japanese people regard the Amer-
ican occupation as beneﬁcia .”

Japanese are an opportunistic
people, he explained. They realize
that they have to rely on the U.S.
at present, so they like the Amer-
icans.

One institution which Hiroo em-
phatically dislikes is our cafeterias.
He grimmaced as he said, “Some-
how when I go into one of those,
I lose my appetite.” ’

When his schooling is complete,
Hiroo Mukai intends to return to
Japan .and continue his occupation
in the news ﬁeld. Waiting for him
are his mother, father, and wif
who are still in Tokyo. .
