 Quarter Hours Discontinued

F or Upperclass Women

by MARTHA HARTLE

Starting today, upperclass women can stop worrying about count-
ing their quarter-hours.

According to Joni Amdur, president of Associated Women Stu-

dents Housing Board, quarter hours will be completely eliminated

. for sophomores, juniors and seniors as of today. These upperclass

,5’ I-wwomen will now have base time curfews of 12:3o‘tro'm‘ Sunday through
‘ Thursday and 2 :30 on Friday and Saturdays.

Freshmen women will still have. quarter hours, but two major

“changes have been made in" their curfew regulations. After Lantern

night (September 27), freshmen will have base curfews of 11:30 from

\ Sunday through Thursday. The previous curfew was 11:00. Base time
remains at 1:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

Sixteen quarter hours are still the maximum per month for fresh-
men during the first term, but that total has been increased to 24 for
the second term.

Housing Board is also investigating the possibility of abolishing
curfews altogether. A committee is currently being formed to write a
no-curfew policy for upperclass ‘women, in particular seniors and girls
over 21 years of age. According to Miss Amdur, there is a possibility
that the system will go into effect by January.

Another innovation in Housing Board this year is the forming of
an Intradorm Council which consists of the presidents and social chair-
men of each dorm. The purposeof this new branch of Housing Board
is to discuss more dormitory activities and programs and to create more

5 dormitory and school spirit. Mrs. Donna Smith, new personnel and pro-
gramming director, will be the advisor. .

' The key issue in my recent fir-

Student ‘Power’:  

From SU Lawn

ToPa13er‘Rights’  

by PAUL sr. JOHN

In An Open Letter to Our Chan-
cellor and Administrators the Com-
mittee of Concerned Students has
made public the demand for stu-
dent involvement in University
policy making. The two page let-
ter was placed in Strategic loca-
tions around campus Monday.

The basic demand is for de-
cision making power, not advisory
power. It was pointed out that in
the past, Student Government re-
commendations “disappear in the
labyrinths of bureaucracy.” In ef-
fect, the additional advisory capaci-
ty given us “leaves the student
as powerless as ever.”

In the proposed system; “Legi-
timate student organs deliberate
on policy decisions in their re-
levant areas. They then present
these decisions to the proper ad-
ministrative official. This Admin-
istrator then considers the merits
or deficiencies of the policy, and
must accept, reject, or modify it
within a period of two weeks. If
he fails to publicly reply within
this period of time, the policy is
automatically enacted. If he re-
jects the proposal or proposes mod-.
ifications, he must publicly justify
his reasons for doing so, accord-
ing to the letter.
This system» is based on the as-
sumption that the general will of

the students directed toward the 7 -7”
good of the University will be--

come law unless the Administra-

tors can point out genuine draw- ’ 

backs or flaws in the proposals.

This assures a democratic yet‘cau- ' I '

tiously controlled reform which

would lead to a stronger Univer-K ..

sity,” the letter stated.

This was applied to two signi-.1

ficant areas; social regulation and

:1

academic policy. Under “Social and  .r 

Housing Regulations” — Men and’
women living in the dormitories
will express their policies through ‘
Men’s Dormitory Council, Associa-. . \
ted Women Students or other ap-t  _
propriate and legitimate bodies.” j 1

powers. . . . . these cabinets are  
obviously going to have to work» ~.; in 315,7

tees.” .

The Committee trusts the Chan-,_ "  

cellor will have a definite reply
with .a “reasonable” length of

time and strongly suggested-.the‘ -

' date of October 1.

The letter was signed by"the«1_i.._g

following members of the Draft-.

ing Committee; Joe -_ Kociubesf

Gail Hammer, Ann Kolson, Peg-

gy Roth, Jeanie Attie, Barry Hal‘-‘  

pin, and Irving Seldin.

Organize Discussion Of Issues

All’ students will have the op-
portunity to meet with members
"of the faculty and administration
to discuss pertinent issues which
affect them on Oct. 12. At a con-

ference‘ sponsored by a number of
students. Samll groups will meet
together with an administrator, a
faculty member _a n d a student
reader who will officate.

Before the conference can be set
up, the organizers need the help of

The central issue, it can be said
with some certainty, was that I
was willing to disagree with the
Head Resident when I attempted
to discuss with him the advisabil-
ity of several of his policies.

Notwithstanding any disagree-
ment with him, I recognized the
authority of the Head Resident and
at all times carried out his poli-
cies regardless of my evaluation
of their wisdom. '

Zabec unwittingly admitted
that the focal reason for the fir-
ing was my discussion of his poli-
cies with him.

“I am in a position,” Zabec said
on Sept. 10, “that I have to be able
to trust (the counselor), I have to
be able to depend on him to trust
in me: I depend on that. The only
way I«would be able to function
as a Head Resident is having a re-
sident assistant in the house who
is in the position to tell me ex-

' actly what I needed to know and
. _ giveme that type of‘ feedback that

what questions the students want-
to be discussed.

  Willing to Disagree

I needed.

“And if this person is disagree-

ing with policy,” Zabec went on,
“with what I wanted, then I can’t
depend on that person to give back

the type of talk that I wanted.”
The world of University housing
is obviously not yet big enough to
permit discussion of its policies.

The chink in the system which
permits this sort of summary dis-
missal is the fact that it is up to
the individual administrator in the
housing office whether he will to-
lerate dissent or not. Such sweep-
ing discretion seems out of place
at a modern university. In all hon-
esty, I must admit that the Head

Resident of Tower A last year al- 

lowed dissent from his decisions.
Certainly. the firing would have

‘Cover’ To Reflect Reality GSPI A Provides

The University has a new literary magazine, Cover. Form-

erly known as Ideas and Figures, this magazine
both its name and its format.

has changed

“I don’t feel the necessity of re-

creating another college magazine,"' said Editor Charles Crow-
ell. “I see no need for any differentiation between commercial

SLACK'S

and college magazines.”

The title, Cover, was select-
ed because “for a change,
we’re going to call things what
they really are.” And also, the
magazine’s cover will serve as a
canvas to reflect what is in the
magazine and the socio—cultural
environment around it.”

This year’s magazine is going
to be more controversial than in
former years. “When I speak of
controversy, I don’t mean a po-
litical directive, but rather, val-
id art today has its essence in
socio—po1itical revolution and in
middle class opposition. I might
call it sensuous art versus inreal-
ity.”

All manuscripts submitted to
Cover will be judged mainly for
their quality. “We want to see

contemporary art as a direction
in which to point the magazine,”
said the editor. “But we could
hardly disqualify any classical
material. I feel that the maga-
zine should reflect the involve-
ment of the artists who contri-
bute.” He stressed the fact that
Cover is helping to get a lot more
students involved in the magazine.

Cover is also planning to spon-
sor several coffee hours with

speakers from the contemporary.

art and literature scene. Crowell
feels these coffee hours will give
the young writer a chance to see
in what direction the field is go-
ing.

The first issue is scheduled for
the end of November. In the
meantime, Crowell must meet
with the Chancellor to discuss the
new lay-out of the magazine. “We
must see what the repercussion
will be if some of our new ideas
are used,” he explained. “I want
to see how liberal the University
will be.”

by RUTH ZAPLIN

It is the responsibility of every t

nation to ensure the confidence
of its people by providing high
caliber decision-makers in all lev-
els of government. This can be ef-
fected through special education
and training offered at institu-
tions like the University’s Grad-
uate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs (GSPIA).

The aim of this institution is to
provide a curricula that will satis-
factorily train its graduates for
tasks participating in the planning
and execution of public programs.
collaboration with the creators
and managers of public institu-
tions, and indentification with
leadership in various aspects of
public affiars.

makes GSPIA an exceptional in-
stitution devoted to providing ed-
ucational, research and advisory
services in public and internation-
al affairs.

Today’s problems of govern-
ment policy require the attention
of creative men and women will-
ing to involve themselves in pub-
lic service. GSPIA endeavors to
produce these people.

Another aim of GSPIA is to
promote economic and social pro-
gress of newly independent and
developing states. This accounts
for the enrollment of about 40 per
cent of GSPIA’s students from
outside the U. S., according to
Carlson, this is a primary reason
for GSPIA’s inequeness.

2nd Largest Employer
University Offers Huge
Areas of Employment

Co-llege graduates who are
perplexed as to their futures
have been overlooking a very
promising field of employment
—the University. According to
Leland P. Deck, personnel man-
ager of the University, “the
University as an employer is
expanding at a rate of between
18-20 percent a year.”

“The etrouble is,” he continued,
“the public thinks in terms of
a University employing only two
types: those involved in the
teaching professions a nd cus-
todians or secretaries. But in
reality, the University is the sec-
ond largest employer in 1tOWI'1.”

Deck attributed the promin-
ence of the University as an em-
ployer ‘to the increase in popu-
lation, “due to materialism,” he
smiled. “There are more young
today and a larger portion of
them are in college. Another di-

- mension -is that more of them

are staying in college longer.
It’s typical today to think in
terms of graduate school after
graduation.”

The graying excutive, a for-
mer officer of the National Sci-
ence Foundation, adjusted his
bowtie and went on enthusiatic-
ally in his description of the
emloyment opportimities in a
large university. ‘

“The University has the lar-
gest bookstore in the area. We
run the largest boardinghouse
in Western Pennsylvan-la and the
largest research ourtfit. We em-
ploy a large number of profes-
sional accountants, architects,
property managers and MD’s.
But the public never thinks of
a University as an employer,”
he concluded.

The Personnel Manager here
summiarizd a few drawbacks in
working in a university. “One
inhibiting factor is that there

is no route «to becoming a col-
lege president without first be-_
ing an University professor,”
he began.

“Also, the University gives no
bonuses; no stock options to em-
poyces,” he added.

Another thing that Deck warn-
ed against was a student seeking
employment in the place where
he earned his degree. “It’s very
difficult for a student to stay
in the same environment and
Change roles. I recommend that
a student think in terms of

another University,” he advised.

On the other side of the ques-
tion-, there are a number of as-'
sets in working in a university.
Besides the expansion rate of
9 mp-l o y m e n t_ opportunities,
which is six -times that of the
3VeI'age corporation, one realizes
a “psychic income.”

“Working in a university is
a meaningful, worthwhile pur-
sui,” Mr. Deck believes. “It’s
more than just self-aggandize.
ment. A person feels that he is
having a favorable impact on
the world and society.” ,, ,_ ,_

“But,” he went on, “one thing
can really diminish the psychic
mC0me that a person gets. That's
Organized harrassment that at-
tempts .to undermine the aca-
demic ladership of the college
president._ It’s the biggest prob-
lem.”

Zoffer Appointed New Dean S  
Of Graduate Business School

Dr. H. Jerome Zoffer is the
new dean of the University
Graduate School of Business.
At 38, he is the University's

‘ youngest academic school dean.

In announcing the appoint-
merit Chancellor Posvar said,
“Zoffer will bring vigorous new
leadership to «the school as it
enters a major period of growth
and development.” Zoffer, who
previously was Associate Dean
of the Graduate Business School,
replaces Albert W. Frey who re-
tired at the end of the last 'aca-

Wednesday, September

demic year.

“Dr. Zoffer is 1a youthful and
dynamic leader. Under his di-
rection the sc hool wi-1-1 com-
mence a new phase in_ its search
f0I“ a national and initerniat-ional
reputation in the field of bus-
iness investment,” Posvar add.
ed. It’s major emphasis will be
the preparation of a cosmopoli-
tan group of talented men and
women from a variety of aca-

‘demic backgrounds for positions

in regional and national indus-
try‘)! ,

Schweiker To Discuss
Draft, Campaign Issues

Congressman Richard’ S. Schweiker, Republican candidate for
the US Senate, will visit the University campus Thursday. He will
speak informally in the SU Lobby at noon on the draft and other
campaign issues. A luncheon and press conference will follow, with
area college newspaper personnel taking part.

Schweiker, who is running against incumbent Democratic Sena-
tor Joseph M. Clark, proposes a gradual end to the draft and the
subsequent establishmerrtof an all-volunteer Armed Forces. He states
in a position paperlthat reforms in the present system, including
military pay increases to make‘ enlistment more attractive and re-
duotion of unnecessary military jobs, could make a completely volun-
tary army possible “within two to five years."

However, he believes that “If the military draft were abolished
suddenly, it would unwisely jeopardize (U.S.) national security," and
that the’ draft is sometimes a necessary evil.

Schweiker was first elected to Congress in 1960. He has sup-
ported legislation encouraging reduction of military costs and in-
creasing pay for military personnel. His campus visit is sponsoredlby
the University Young Republicans and by Citizens for Schweiker.

Hey Baby! Is That The
‘Real’ Pittsburgh Tour

by DON MARBURY

I was looking through a tour guide the other
day entitled “Come See Pittsburgh.” I was surpris-
ed to see that three of our most beautiful tourist
attractions were not mentioned in the travelogue.

ff Let’s Join Hands

The vague term Student Power or its eumphemistic coun-
terpart, student involvement mean many things to many peo-
ple. Some individuals see it as the “Mark Rudd” radical-
ism that provokes voilent confrontation. Others see it has a

‘ ‘hapless movement with sound, just and humane ideals. And

John Vasquez of the Boston University News has written that
“student power is dead,” for faculty-student “control of the
university is not a fundamental solution to the problems

1. I plaguing students.”

The crux of Mr. Vasquez’s article was that the free uni-
versity—the ultimate goal of educational reform and student
involvement in University decision making- is impossible in
an “unfree society.” In short, student activism, according
to Vasquez’s reasoning, has left the society unchanged.

From this sea of emotional masturbation, we can con-
.clude the movement of student involvment, student rights,
and academic reform at the University has‘ failed to coal- ’
esce. While some 250 students here at the University have
solidly backed a proposal which would grant students a

I  areal decision making power, the other 15,750 full and part-

' .’ time undergraduates remain silent and perhaps unconvinced.

The cry, “we are for the students’.’ is always heard.
The Pitt News says its for the students; Student Govern-
ment (SG) says its for the students; the Commuter Associa-
tion says that its for the students; and the Committee of Con-

 :. rcemed Students says that it represents students. The ques-

tion that all the. representative groups on campus have fail-
ed to realize is what the students at this University want.

V All the student groups are guilty of one up-manship,
we all must do it our way. All of us have been mapping solu-
tions to the undemocratic situation at the University, but we
have failed to sound out student opinion. All of us have lect-
ured, but we haven’t listened. ‘ I

The lecturing may continue, and all of us will con-
tinue to run through the same arguments time and time

' again. But there must come a time of decision—a_time when

all of the groups open their eyes and minds and hear a gen-
uine widespread student view point‘. If the Pitt News, SG,
the Commuter Association, and the Committee of Concern-
ed Students fail to do this, we will be guilty of shoving some-
thing down the throats of the students. And it is just this
type of throat stuffing, that all of us reject. In short, if all
‘students do not want “student-power,” the fight for student

I -influences in University goverance should be abandoned at

this..time.

. , But all is not so bleak. There have been speak-outs on
r the Cathedral lawn, but there is a better solution. Student‘
; Govemmentundoubtedly will pass some very essential leg-v
& islation, but, there is a better answer. The answer lies in a
;. movement of coalesence. This would not be a movement in
which everyone would have to adhere themselves to a phil-

, 2 osophy, but a movement of cooperation and compromise.

A respected television commentator recently said that
change is impossible without compromise. And the first
chance for students and faculty to get together and discuss
and debate the widespread issues involved in the “Student
movement” will be at a conference organized by a number of
interested students at the University. But this conference or

‘ i any other scheme of this nature will be a total flop unless

students of all viewpoints participate.

If this conference fails to materialize, student power will
die amidst the cries of mutual hostility and ‘frustration.

is the best example of antiquated architecture in
the city. And what about that fabulous leisure area,‘
the Hill District? They passed up their ehanceto
tell about how proud it makes a man feel to sit all
day and just let the government support himand his

shooting one another for any reason at all.

I bet if they would have remembered that every
kind of disease carrying fly and mosquito can pro-
bably befound in these three areas, they would
have included them in their travelogue. They might
have showed how inventive the people of these
areas have become without the really unimport-
tant things of life like shoes, sufficient winter cloth-
ing, adequate sewage disposal, enough food to eat.
You know . . . . the real extra things of life.

I’ll bet when the writers of that travelogue
realize that they forgot to mention Pittsburgh’s most
interesting tourist attraction they will really be an-
gry with themselves.

Imagine keeping people from seeing these fabu-
lous All-American areas.

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

Who does Wesley Posvar think
he is’ kidding? Who does Wesley
Posvar think he’s dealing with?
If you want to know the truth,
he thinks he’s dealing with fool-

' ish children (i.e. students). In his

statement in the Pitt News, Pos- -

var called for reorganization;
what he was truly calling for was
pacification. At one point he cal-
led upon the chairmen of the de-
partments to seek more student
opinion and to devise other means
of involving the students. To this
suggestion, I say bull.

After talking
to one of the
departmental
chairman this
summer, it was
made abundant-
clear that the
chairman was
willing to lis-
ten to student
opinion but was  f-
not willing to  
let the students
make any de-
cisions. This
was based on the grounds that
students do have enough know-
ledge to judge one of their own
teachers. To this, I also say bull._

The Chancellor, if he was tru-
ly serious about formenting a
change, should have called on the
students to be ready to listen to
the opinions of the chairmen,
and then let the .students make
Their decisions as to what polic-
ies should be undertaken.

After this token gesture comes
Posvar’s magnanamous offer to
initiate an all-university council.
Posvar should just come out and
call it what he intends it to be:
a high school type student coun-
cil, where the students suggest
and the administrators decide, a
council that won’t mean a damn
thing in the long run. He says
the council will take “penetrat-
ing examinations,” “considera-
tions of methods,” “evaluations
of concepts,”

These catchy phrases show our
chancellor to be engaging in the
stalling tactics that have been per-
petrated upon students for the past
few centureis. The Chancellor
knows, and the students know,
that now is not the time for a
consideration or an examination.
We do, not need‘ _to «consider. Ia

Rosenblum

Q. V._cliange‘ I. in the _:_rules. of‘Uconduct 

-r. . " '.. 0

  

   
 

for students. There should be no
rules. Let the students exist in
society, and be responsible to the
same rules as our chancellor. Is
it really possible that the chancel-
lor is suggesting that the students
need the help of his council, made
up in part by administration and
faculty members who aren’t even
affected by the rules, to determine
their behavior?

You better believe it!

Obviously, Posvar is skirting the
issue. We know how to behave.
We don’t have to behave on any-
one’s terms but ourown. And we
certainly don’t need the help of a _
crusty administration. Provost,
Vice Provost, or any other mem-
ber of the Geritol set to instruct
us on the proper behavior at a un-
iversity.

Going furthur into his state-
ment, the Chancellor states that
these unique proposals will “in
no way infringe on, or diminish

T the importance of our existing in-

stitutions.” He says his suggestions
will only augment them. Again our
chancellor is engaging in an im-
possibility. He is calling for a
change without changing any-

. thing. He is calling for additions,

and useless ones at that.

The chancellor hopes that his
brilliant example of tokenism will
make the students sit back and
think that good old Wesley real-
ly wants to change things in fa-
vor of_ the students. I’m not rul-
ing out this possibilty, but if a
change comes, it will be only on
his terms, and not ours.

But near the end of his state-
ment comes the most_ superbly
ludicrous phrase of all, the phrase
that proclaims this university to
be an “Institution governed
through an intricate set of de-
mocratic procedures based in di-
alogue, dependent upon com-
munication.” I must again invoke
the name Ferdinard, and say
bull.

How can he call this university
democratic when the people who
pay for its operation have no say
in the quality of the product they
are buying? _

How can he call this univer-
sity democratic when boys can
have girls in their over-priced dorm
rooms only if the door is flung
wide open so that nothing—kiss-

ing, holding hands, or, procregag-.»

tion can occur.‘ A 7

Girls at this democracy must be \

in by a curfew set down by our

moldy father figures. Boys at this 4

democracy cannot have liquor in
their rooms. And yet this is what
Posvar calls a democracy.

Would the chancellor enjoy hav-
ing his liquid intake inhibited?
Would he‘ like to forfeit his pri-
vacy? You’re damn right he
wouldn’t. But he can very easily
say that things are democratic.
Sheesh! Come on chancellor.

Following that grandeloquent
phrase, Posvar says he “only
wants to improve the university
by strengthening the voice of the
student. Again he’s hiding behind
his mouth.

What he is again trying not to
say is that he hopes the students
will keep talking, and not start
overtly acting. He wants us to keep
telling him what we want so he’ll
be able not to give it to ‘us. He

wants us to keep asking and not

demanding. This summer I watch-
ed the Black Action Society hurl
invectives and threats all over the
place; but guess what? They ach-
ieved what they desired.

This summer The Pitt News sta-
ted that it had learned the true
tactics of persuasion. I hope it
learned them from the Black Ac-
tion .Society. I hope this news-
paper realizes that its editorial
that termed the chancellor’s state-
ment “A Victory,” was a poor
judgment. This newspaper is
learning. It has demanded the re-
instatement of Bill‘ Peterson, and
you danm well better believe
that Bil1’s going to be back very
shortly. (At least, that ‘is my own
personal prediction.)

Chancellor, you were awfully
cool when you came down to the
jail and bailed us out with your
own pocket money, but it’s a long
time ‘from May to December.
We can’t be silent and grateful
forever. The Pitt News is wak-
ing up. Our student government
president has not only awakened,
but is roaring. The students should
be roaring too.

Don’t put up with nonsensical

-rules. '

Don’t reliquish your right as
a decision maker at this school.

 How OurReaclers

Alumni Raps Student Power

Editor, The Pitt News: A
I have read your front page ar-

ticle (Sept. 9, 1968) on student_

power. It is only democratic for
the students to have a voice in
their establishment, you say.

Well, my friend, you are 100
per cent wrong.

Ina free society the right to
control an institution rests with
the owners of the institution. The

University is a private institution. '

It is owned by private interests
and governed by their representa-
tives. You are a student. For some
reason you applied to attend the
University of Pittsburgh.

The university agreed to accept
you as a student. They ‘did not
agree to give you any control over
the administration of the univer-
sity; .

The. criminals at Columbia Uni-
versity felt the same way. They
wanted to control Columbia Uni-
versity. They wanted to control
Columbia University. They used
force. You use words. But their’
philosophy and yours is identical.

_ “I want it. Therefore, I should

_have it.”

You object to some of the po- '

licies of the university. This does
not give you the right to control
the university. You object to some
of the people who run the univer-
sity. This does not give you the
right to make them your slaves.
You would like to run a universi-
ty. I saythat you have no right
to run the University of Pitts-
burgh. The right of-control can
only rest upon the right of own-
ership. And you don’t own it.

Do you want to go to the trou-
ble of starting your own univer-
sity? No, you don’t. Would you
rather have someone else create
.a university for you so you can
take it over? Yes, you would. Do
you deserve to run a university?
No, you don’t. Who does deserve
to run a university? Those who
own it, or their representatives.

Your desire to control the uni-
versity is a denial of the concepts
of property rights. And as I read
my daily paper . . . and see what

L, is happening all over the country

. . the attitude toward private
property . . . you have a lot of
company.

Some day you will want some-
thing, want it desperately.

And, finally, it will be yours.
And then there will be a knock
at your door. Some lunatic will be
standing there to say, “I want it.
Therefore, I should have it.” At
that moment you will see the true
nature of evil. And, my friend,
your article will have helped to
make the existence of the lunatic
possible.

Grad Praises
First Issue

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a new student at the Univer-
sity, I was pleasantly surprised
by the first edition (Sept. 9, 1968)
of The Pitt News. The forceful
and optimistic tone of your cover
editorial, the truly informative ar-
ticle on Black-White relations at
Pitt, and the arresting essay on
University - Student relations b y
Gerald Farber, are all indicative
of a newspaper that truly seeks to
inform and inspire its readers.

As an alumnus of a college,
which though smaller than Pitt
shares most of the University’s
published complaints, I know how
futile a campus permeated by
apathy can be to an activist min-
ority.

My only comment in this direc-
tion is to advise actively pursu-
ing a “meaningful exchange of
ideas” through established chan-
nels first, concentrating on “tell-
ing it like it is,” before reluctant-
ly (but purposively) turning to
more militant methods for recog-
nition of legitimate complaints.

Please continue the good work
you are obviously pursuing in
your journalistic endeavors.

Claims ‘News’ Reproached Her

Editor, The Pitt News:

I categorically deny your alle-
gations in the Pitt News Sept.
13) that I believe “that the BAS
is a racist group.” As I pointed
out in a letter dated early in Aug-
ust, which the Pitt News has not
seen fit to publish. I would not
presume to express such a judg-
ment of the BAS, not knowing
enough about that organization to

In arrive at that or any other opinion.

I am now being editorialized
against. To reproach me for an
opinion that was not mine and
that I have identified as such is
to add insult to injury. A further
injury is to misquote me as call-
ing the statement of the BAS a
“blatantly fascist document": I
said nothing of the sort.

What my letter really amount-

ed to was a heartfelt plea against

, the use of race as a criterion of

an individual’s worth, and a de-

nunciation of racism in any form.

No one would have guessed this
from your editorial.

That my criticism of some pass-

gt- ages in the BAS statement was in-
terpreted by an editor as a blank-
et condemnation of the Society.

'. cy toward inexact. thi_n,king_. that j _.-

In the interest of responsible
journalism, to which I hope you are
dedicated, I think two apologies
are in order: one to th e BAS
(which I have no reason to wish
other than well, though I disagree
with parts of that particular state-
ment), and the other to myself.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Ethnic jokes are as old as the
groups they chide. Often it can
ease tensionbetween religious or
racial groups to laugh about one-
self. If, Mr. Rosenblum is, then,
making an ethnic joke, then he is
neither an adapt comedian nor a
tasteful one. He has slapped his
religion in the face with slander-
ous examples of the goals of his
“Jewish Power” proponents.

His generalizations make him
sound like the spokesman for the
Jews on campus. But maybe he is
seriously attacking his fellow
Jews. Once again his taste is call-
ed into question. Or is ‘it Black
Power that he is larripooning.
What are you saying Mr. Rosen-
blum? If you have a valid point
to make, please restate your case
more literally and lucidly.

  Zombies Off

by JOE ANDERSON

 

   

It is usuallyvery difficult to narrow down classifications so
that they will fit the style of a certain group. In most cases the
attempt is doomed to failure for the singular fact that there are
as many categories as there are groups. Nonetheless, it is rela-
tively safe to assume that the new album by the Zombies,
Odessy and Oracle (Date-TES 4013), is best subscribed to the

“good time music” column.

In characterization, this style of music would be non—controver-
sial, unpretentious with a minimum of studio and amplified effects.
Found under this headline are such groups as the Lovin’ Spoonful, the
Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Youngbloods. This music doesn’t

ta'ke soul, but competence and a
certain degree of imaginative in-
souciance. It is simple and is
meant for good times. '

Odessy and Oracle is an oasis
of originality in a desert of imi-
tation. The material on this rec-
ord is truly remarkable for its re-
freshing vitality. The first song,
“Care of Cell 44,” is the story of
a man who is anxiously awaiting
the return from prison of his love.
The song opens with a clear-cut
piano backed up by stringsin tre-
melo which help create the fara-
way separated mood. Then the
chorus breaks in with the happy
sound of anticipation—“It feels so
good you coming home soon.”

“A Rose for‘Emily” relates the
sad circumstance of Emily des-
tined to be a spinster. There is
plenty of love in the air but none

er ‘Good Time Music’

for Emily. “She will grow old and
die.” Her garden of roses will
fade and there will be none left
to cover her grave. Emily’s pride
kept her from living the life of
which she often dreamed.

Although fate is so cruel to poor
Emily, it nonetheless lets a
brighter shade of coloring in “I
Want Her She Wants Me.” Here
there is such an abundance of
warmth and happiness that it just
spills forth into every corner of
the listener’s mind. The chorus in
this piece is strongly reminiscent
of the early Beatles.

The strange a n d enchanting
guitar and organ work in “Beech—
wood Park” creates an air of nos-
talgia, a longing for those “sum-
mer daya, after summer rains
when we could count the evening
stars in Beechwood Park.” The vo-
cal goes on to swear that “I can’t
forget you; won’t forget you.”

In “Changes,” a soft, almost
sirupy, flute infuses an ethereal
yet transitory effect while con-
gas add a Latin-American tinge.

The song is that of a man who ’

witnesses a drastic change in his
girl after she suddenly comes into
some money. No longer the queen
of summer’s crown, she has be-
come a slave of money’s preten-
tions. ‘

The most interesting song on
this album is “Butcher’s Tale,” a
sad mournful piece set in the
World War I scene. The butcher,
although used to the blood and
gore of the violent death, is ap-
palled b y th e slaughter -house
deaths of his friends. Resignedly,
he accepts the absurdity of war
but pleads, “I want to go home;
please let me go home.” The ac-
cordian in this piece helps to es-
tablish the setting as that of the
WW I era and adds a touch of
irony all its own. '

Odessy and Oracle is the best
the Zombies have done to date.
‘The old flavor of their singles,
“Tell Her No” and “She’s Not
There” is still evident especially
in songs like “Time of the Sea-
son.” But from this point the Zom-
bies have gone a step further.
Their music has become clearer,
more precise and with a stronger
emphasis on the technical struc-
ture. .

It’s good to hear the Zombies
again. Let’s hope that Odessy and
Oracle will give a new impetus
to the renovation of the “good
time” sound.

Phi Delta Psi

Starting a new group, it has of-
ten been said, entails many pro-
blems. Policies and goals must be
initiated so that a unity is creat-
ed which makes the group mem-
bers want to work. Since Phi Del-
ta Psi was recognized by IFC last
February, the brothers of this
fraternity have discovered that run-
ning a new gruop does indeed
mean problems.

After IFC recognizes a new
group, a probationary period of six
months follows. If after this time
the group is still stable, it can
apply for a position as a perman-
ent member.of IFC. As of this
time, Phi Delta Psi has not tak-
en this step. For a fraternity to
survive and be “stable,” it de-
pends on rush and the following
pledge class. This is one thing
themembers of Phi Delta Psi
have been concentrating on. The
first pladge class of sixteen mem-
bers were initiated into the frat‘
at the end of the 1968 Winter
Term. -

This fallhowever, is the first
time that Phi Delta Psi has rush-
ed with the rest of the fraterni-
ties on campus. The brothers agree
that there is a feeling of compe-
tition between them and other
fraternities. It begins to feel like
putting on a show or spectacular
in order to impress the Rushees.
Yet at the same time, the group
tries to maintain its feeling of in-
dividuality. This involves more
time and work [than people real-
ize.

The feeling of individuality or
purpose of the group is something
that Phi Delta Psi probably finds

. most difficult. In order for a new

group to function as a unit, there
must be mutual goals set. “We
want this group to be more than
something that stands for Satur-
day Night Socials,” says Presi-
dent Larry Langer. “But this is
hard to achieve—we’re working
with a small number- of people
relatively speaking, and right now,
everyone is busy with Rush and
keeping the fraternity operation-
al. This idea of more than a social
group seems to be momentarily
lost.”

‘ Usually, when a group relies
on its members to carry on the
work load, it ends up that some
members are hard workers while
others seem to sit back. “Unfor-

tunately,” points out Langer,

“sometimes you have —members

who want to work but either nev-

er make this known, or else you

don’t need them at that moment.

It hurts the group, when this
happens—especia1ly since we’re'
such a small number. You want
to be fair with everyone.”

The brothers of Pi Delta Psi
have wanted to colonize with a
national fraternity. This really
creates problems. One of the
groups basic and original goals
has been to remain a non-sectar-
ian group. “When you begin

talking about Nationals,” indica-
ted a few brothers, “it’s hard to
find one that appeals to every-
one. This is probably one of_ the
biggest problems a local fraternity
can face; since the entire chara-
ter of the group is revealed
through the ideas of the nation-
al fraternity.

“Learning to operate as a group
is a hard thing,” the brothers
grant. “But yet, each member
knows that given time and effort,
a new ‘group can work. The big
thing is unity for a purpose.”

 Speaks Out  

(Continued from Page 1)

Consequences of the dismissal
have been interesting. The hous-
ing office has had to take on the
nose the protests voiced by other
counselors. If it began to sum-
mararily fire the counselors who
condemned the decision, the re-
sulting uprising in the Towers
would make the protest that fol-
lowed my dismissal look like apa-
THY. If the firing accomplished
nothing else, it provided a tem-
porary atmosphere wherein dis-
sent could be freely voiced by
counselors. =

was to dampen creative adminis-
tration and communication among
the resident assistant staff. While
few feel they can openly admit
it, they have little desire to take
risks or plan programs that might
meet with the displeasure of the

housing office. Furthermore, three

Tower A Counselors have stated
that they have no intention to take
any serious problems to Zabec.

On my final day. as house coun-
selor, I ,was willing to concede to
the Head Resident each point and
stated my willingness to take the
blame for the episode. This was
done without threat on my part,
as a means whereby he could al-
ter his decision without losing
face, but he did not choose to re-
spond.

Face-saving is an important ex-
ercise in the housing -office and
the University generally. One does
not reverse his subordinates once
a controversial stand has been tak-
en. Thus, being somewhat practical,
I don’t anticipate being reinstated
as Random House counselor. The
housing office could assure the
counselors (indirectly to save face)
that their jobs will not be imperil-
ed either by dissent or unwritten
rules.

In this way, the consequences
of this recent decision of the Hous-
ing office might be lessened for
40 Towers counselors and 110 resi-
dents of Random House for whom
I have a great regard. They de-'
serve something better.

SUB To Present  
‘The Drunkard’

Bor Herrod’s production of The
Drunkard will be staged in the
SU Ballroom Sept. 29. The play
is a revivial of the well-known
melodrama by W.N. Smith.

The Drunkard combines all the
elements of a classic tearjerker.
The entire performance‘ is ac-_
companied by a piano which, by
playing a leitmotif for each of T
the three central characters, cues
the audience to its appropriate’
verbal reaction.

In order to help the audience
enter into the spirit of The Drun-
kard, free popcorn is passed
around during the performance.
The audience is given links of

songs and patter between 
and at one point, a chorus‘gi_rl_

ventures into the audience ‘to,

“find a likely lap on,which5-tor”

rest herself.”

The play illustrates, according

to Bob Sarlin of The Phoenix,
“one man’s descent from proprie-
ty to an oversized garbage can in

New York City.” Herbert Berk-‘
owitz of Kingsman calls The

Drunkard “a Serendipity of ‘Thes-
pian Delight.” . ‘

Congress in Vienna

Wilfrid Sellars; University philosophy professor, recently returned

from the University of Vienna where he attended the International‘

Philosophers Congress. The Congress is held every five years with re-
presentatives from’all over the globe.

Philosophers submited papers discussing their current thoughts‘.

-These papers were read, discussed, and published in the Congress’ _,
report. A major topic of concern at this Congress was Marxism and Hu.- 

manism.

For the first time, students ask-
ed to join the discussion. The
Philosophers gave the students per-
mission to select representatives
who would contribute to the dis-
cussion.

Professor Sellars is a member
of the International Federation

UCLA Week, as coach Dave Hart puts it, is in full
swing. The Panthers are down to their final work-
outs and are looking anxiously for the opening whis-

Last week proved to be a difficult one for Hart H
and the gridders. “It was sort of a lame-duck week,”
said Hart. “It was too early to get up for the game,

Hart was referring to Saturday’s scrimmage in
which he described the team’s over-all performance
as sluggish. “We were not running very well and we
didn’t work in unison getting to the ball,” he ex-

Poor timing and the lack of over-all speed are two
items which the gridders must improve on before
they hit the West Coast. “On Film, UCLA looks
quicker than ever,” continued Hart. “And as Coach
Prothro put it, ‘Pitt looks slow of foot.”

“You can’t play college football unless you have
unison and quickness,” Hart stated. “I hope that with
this week’s shorter practices, both our quickness and
general enthusiasm and spirit will pick-up.”

all players. Monday, Kokor began grooming good mean grid-

The freshmen worked on their fourth play, the 8-option. The signal-

The backs and ends collided for

and then jogged 40 yards, sprinted

Yesterday the Cubs learned to
defend against the pass.

“There are three techniques of
pass protection,” explained Ko-

  10-THE PITT NEWS—Wednesday, September 18, 1968

 VOrnhagen Likes Extra Training,

Views Richey’s Return

Coach Jim Banner’s cross
country team is chirping opti-
mistic notes in this last week
before facing competition.

Sophomore distanceman Mark
Vornhagen believes that he is
stronger than last year and also
has become a better runner. “I
think I’ve learned to pace myself
and run hills better,” said Vorn-
hagen.

Mark believes that practicing
at the Schenley Park course gen-
erally helps the squad. “Our course
is pretty tough. The other cour-
ses are usually flatter. And it just
may be that hill running is our
greatest team strength,” stated
Vornhagen.

The team has been training
twice a day since August 25”‘-
The practice is now down to once
a day. Mark commented, “We’ve
had more practice than last year,
and I also feel that we’re better
and stronger since last year.” Vom-
hagen believes that harriers Ai-
ken and Yaksick are particularly
stronger than they were last Sep-
tember.

 yHagner, Cobb Top Runners

On Eager Freshman Squad

Although only one freshman harrier is on full scholarship,
the frosh are eager to show what they can do. All ten or 12
boys are all recognized as hard workers.

The two outstanding members of the squad are Bob Hagner and
Dave Cobb. Hagner’s high school in Reading, Pa., won last year’s state
championship, while he took second place among the state cross-coun-
try competitors.

The freshmen will run basically the same meets as the varsity with

. the exception of the trip to Notre Dame. In addition, coach Banner

has said that he will only take the freshmen to the IC4A’s if a few
members of the squad show outstanding achievement.

This Saturday the frosh battle Kent State at Schenley Park. Hag-

ner warns, “Kent State has a kid from Canada who should be terrific.

\ I can’t really say much about how the meet will go. We should have a
better idea of what kind of squad we have after this first meet. ’

Good GameAgainst Frosh

Lifts Boaters’ Team Spirit;
Lekoma Sparks Scrimmage

Monday’s soccer practice didn’t look too promising from
the start. Norm Roux, a junior fullback, limped onto the field
with his foot bandaged due to a swimming mishap, and Bob Quinlin,
another expected starter, was walking around with leg injuries suffer-
ed in Saturday’s scrimage against the freshmen.

The team enthusiasm that Coach Leo Bemis has been talking
about just didn’t seem to exist. The squad went through a usual warm-
up stint of exerciese. Then they practiced kick-offs and corner kicks
for awhile. ‘

Next, came a scrimmage against their frosh counterparts. This,
too, started out rather unsuccessfully. The freshmen jumped off to a
quick lead after grabbing an errant pass in front of the varsity’s goal.

Not too long afterward, the players sitting on the bench were in
the trees surrounding Kennard Field searching for a couple lost balls.
This topped the miserable afternoon.

Then, suddenly, everything was different. Conference Lekoma
sparked the varsity with the scoring touch that is desparately needed
this year. The little African slapped in three goals, positioning him-

9 self perfectly play after play. Soon, there were two more shots booted

past thefreshman goalie.

The defense stiffened and the freshmen had trouble getting pos-
session. The spirit was back. It stayed with the team during their re-
turn to the Field House locker room.

Outside the Field House the team huddled and let outthe usual
yell, the symbol of their enthusiasm, and they meant it.

Infamous Yogis Return

by LAWRENCE P. BERRA

Although the prophets of Sports

azines have finally realized the
potential of some of the individ-
ual talent across the country, the
1968 football forecasts are lack-
ing.

In a humanitarian effort, the
more capable Yogis will help the
bettors beat. or tie. or lose to the
bookies.

This year’s list of infamous and
unknown Yogis is headed by Jump-
shot Jake who will try to prevent
Benito from continuing the rule.
of the dictatorship in this area. ’

“I really don’t have to predict
the game outcomes,” said Sports
Editor Roy “Jumpshot” Jacobs
modestly, “I know them. But just
to prove that I’m human I will
make many wrong predictions.”

In each of the past two years,
the Editors-in-Chief Fred “Bang”
Frank and Linda “Beulah” Gold-
stein, captured the Yogi crown.
