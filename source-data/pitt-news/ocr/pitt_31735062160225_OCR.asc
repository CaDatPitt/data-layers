THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Off Discrimination Stand

 

Illegal Driver
Deprives Delts

2 Of Trophy

After a stormy session be-
tween six fraternities and
members of the Spring Car-
nival committee Friday after-
noon, the award for Thurs-
day’s sweepstakes trophy
went to Phi Gamma Delta
when it was proven that the
driver of the Delta Tau Delta en-

try, George Billy, was a Tech stu— .

dent. .

Actual winner of the race was
the cart entered by the Delts, but
Thursday afternoon ﬁve fraterni-
ties, Pi Lambda Phi, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Delta Theta, and Phi Epsilon Pi,
entered protests and asked that
the Delts be disqualiﬁed. They

pointed to IF rules which state
_ that non-Pitt men are prohibited

from participating in inter-frater-
nity sports.
, Delts Defend Position

The Delts defended their posi-
tion on Spring Carnival rules,
stating that although a non-Pitt
driver is illegal under IF rules,

. there is nothing in Carnival event

rules to prohibit ‘outside partici-
Therefore, the Delts,
claimed, even if the driver was
from Tech, the Delts could still

- claim their reward.

Lud Lippert, IF president, clari-
fled the rules by explaining that
Carnival and IF worked jpintly on

v the Sweepstakes, and that eligibil-

ity of a cart for the race came un-

' der IF jurisdiction.

, Greenberg Disagrees

At this point, the Delts claimed
that the driver of their entry was
a Pitt man, but Jack Greenberg,
Festival chairman, and Garry Don-
ahue, Phi Delt representative, dis-
agreed. They identiﬁed the driver
as Billy.

After the meeting broke up,
with nothing solved, Greenberg
took a picture of the disputed
driver to the Tech Dean of Men
who conﬁrmed the fact the
driver was Billy, Tech student
and member of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity there.

City Detectives Still Hunting
Missing Phi Ep-IF Trophy

It has been three weeks since
the IF’s “All Points” Trophy was
stolen from the Phi Epsilon Pi
house, and the $60 bauble was still
among the missing today.

City detectives were without
clues as to the identity of the
thugs responsible for its theft, and
had exhausted all leads as to its
whereabouts.

Ron Ecker, Phi Ep prexy, reit-
erated his offer of last week, by

Sherwood Replaces Brailey

In Dean of Men’

_The appointment of Paul M.¢

Sherwood to the post of assistant
to the dean of men has been an-
nounced.

He will replace Lester G.
Brailey, who leaves the University
at the end of the semester to take
a job in industry.

Mr. Sherwood will be adviser
to student Congress and related
activities, and also act as a stu-
dent counselor. Up to now, he had
been employed in the office as a
part—time assistant.

The personnel shift in the
DOM’s oﬁice has also resulted in
a re-shuffling of responsibilities
of the other assistant deans.

J. Edward Ricart from" now on
will have charge of the placement
bureau and scholarships,

cerned with fraternities and oth-
er men’s organizations and activ-
ities.

which the persons in possession
of the trophy can leave it in some
place made known to the Phi Eps,

“We’re getting worried about
this business,” he said, “accord-
ing to the rules, we might have

to pay for the thing if it does not
turn up.”

Decision on Pictorial

Magazine Due Monday

A ﬁnal decision/on whether Pitt will have a new student.

magazine to succeed the banned Panther is due next Mon-

day, when the publications board holds its

the semester.
The board will act on recom-
mendations in favor of a new mag-

azine drafted at a special commit-
tee meeting last Monday.

According to Committee Chair-
man Prof. Robert X. Graham, his
group will recommend that the
board approve a “feature-pic-
toria1” type publication that will
cover student activities, athletics,
and University departments.

Editor To Be Picked

If the board decides to estab-
lish the proposed magazine, an ex-
ecutive committee will be / ap-
pointed to select the editor and
business manager of the new pub-
lication.

Mr. Graham explained that,
while the executive committees of
other University publications have
power‘ only , to recommend new
editors for ﬁnal decision by the
board, and business managers in
the case of the new magazine the
executive committee will have

      

last meeting of

will not convene again this se-
mester.
Good Taste

The special committee’s recom-
mendations for the new publica-
tion stress that subject matter and
treatment must be in “good taste”
and limited to the campus.

Mr. Graham said that the rec-
ommended editorial policy does
not include, but does not forbid,
the use of humor. The journalism
professor added that “the term
‘feature-pictorial’ suggestes that it
would not be a humor magaﬁine.”

The committee agreed that liter-
ary matter—essays, short stories,
and poems—would be acceptable.
They stipulated that all material,
including photography, is to be
original, and that treatment is to
be “non-satirical.”

. No Supervision

According to Mr. Graham, the
committee will not ‘recommend
that the new magazine be placed
under any faculty supervision dif-

Committee_-Vlill Check f
With National Groups

Men’s Council voted Friday to hold up action on the dis-
crimination issue until information could be obtained from
national fraternities on their policy in dealing with chapters
where the school has rules against exclusion clauses.

The motion delaying the action was proposed by Harry

‘A " ‘ "  " ’"9Doug'nerty. Mel Forst, who pro-

posed the anti-exclusion clause
motion, and the resolutions co-
author, Harvey Rabinovitz, ‘op-
posed the action to delay a vote
on the issue.
Committee Assigned
While Council President Ronald

Men’s Council’s investiga-
tion of discrimination in men’s
professional, social, and hon-
orary organizations‘ will start ‘
this afternoon at 2:30 p.m. in
304 C1. The presidents of these
societies or their representa-
tives are requested to be pres-
ent at the meeting‘.

The purpose of the meeting
is to determine the reaction of
the groups involved. to the
proposed legislation of MC, ‘
and how discrimination clauses
can be banned from the or-
ganizations’ charters.

The discussion will be con-
ducted by the Investigation of
Discrimination Committee of
MC, according to Mel Forst,
chairman.

Ecker requested that the commit-
tee assigned to check with the na-
tional organizations report next
Friday, the whole question will
probably have to wait until next
fall before it comes to a vote since
answers from the nationals proba-
bly will not be received by then.

Forst’s motion, admittedly aimed
at fraternity exclusion clauses

reads: “Because discriminatory
practices are inconsistant with
basic democratic ideals, Men’s

Council of the University of Pitts-
burgh ,is opposed to clauses of ex-
clusion in the constitutions and
charters of men’s student organi-
zations; and recommends that the
administration withdraw recogni-
tion from any such groups that
fail to remove the clauses.” »

Programs Enforced

Speaking for his motion, Forst -

claimed that Minnesota, Miami,
and Washington and Jefferson
have enforced similar programs,
and that most national fraternities
will permit a chapter to function
without the exclusion clause rather
than lose a chapter.

Forst suggested that at least one
year be given each involved or-
ganization to either have the ex-
clusion clause removed from the
sonstitution, or make provisions
for chapters involved by school
action.

Pitt Football

The Atlantic Reﬁning Com-

football broadcasts may prove a
boon to Pitt athletics rather than a
disadvantage. ’

According to the athletic de-
partment, there is a good chance
that basketball, as well as foot-
ball, will get radio coverage un-

over getting a sponsor,” says

Cracks Appear in Walls
Of New Field House!

Pitt's ﬁve-month-old Memorial
Field House is beginning to show
the lines of old age more appropri-
ate to venerable old structures
erected ages ago.

Large cracks, and rain seepage
are showing on the inner walls of
the building and a tree stump has
sprouted beneath the stands, it is
reported.

A Normal Occurrence

University officials and accred-
ited contractors assured the News
that these signs are always ex-
pected in a new structure of this
type. They said that the cracks
and leaks were being taken care of
and would present no serious
problem to the structure. The
cracks in the wall were attributed
to the settling and hardening of
the concrete. _

The Trimble Co., contractors for
the Fieldhouse, were contacted
and assured the News that the’ set-
tling” of foundations and the ap-
pearance of cracks in large walls
was to be expected in all new
structures.

Carver Explains

Frank Carver, Pitt’s athletic

‘publicity director, stated that the

well aware of these facts and pro-
tective and preventative measures
had been taken against recurrence
of the faults.

Carver stated that cracks such
as those appearing in the Field
House walls are normal in struc-
tures with large wall areas. He
further said that the Trimble con-
tractors who built the structure
were at work repairing these
cracks and taking measure against
the recurrence of similar faults.

Pitt Protected

Carver said that the University
had a form of guarantee on the
Field House for one year, which
covered the repair of minor dif-
ﬁculties such as these.

Le Blane I s New
SC Advisor

In one of its shortest sessions to
date, Student Congress began
winding up its affairs for the year
and laid plans for next year’s do-
ings.

The solons elected Dr. DeNux
LeBlanc of the geography de-
partment to replace former fac-
ulty advisor Alfred C. Payne.

Congress also approved Ron
Ecker’s motion to send an oﬁicial
observer to the National Student
Association meeting late in Aug-
ust. This means that Congress has
decided, at least temporarily, not
to join the nationwide organiza-
tion. President Burwinkle said that
Congress would have a better idea
on whether or not to join after a

representative attended the con-—
vention.

Hard Task

A summer in Europe with all
expenses paid probably sounds
wonderful. And to Adele Marrie-
cini, WSGA president and Betty
Pickering, chief justice of Senior
Court, it is. But it also involves a
great many problems. ,

These two junior women, who
were awarded the Nationality
Room scholarships on Tap Day
are really busy. In the midst of
preparing for ﬁnals, they are also
concerned with attending ‘to the
many details that must be accom-
plished before their trip can be
realized. Their minds are ﬁlled
with vaccinations, passports, and
clothes. They think that a. prob-
lem worthy of Einstein’s consider-
ation is how they're going to stuff
all their belongings into a single
suitcase and a hatbox. ‘
Wardrobe Worries

Adele thought she had the
clothes problem solved by buying
an entire nylon wardrobe. B t to
her dismay she learned tha the
climate will be much too hot to
wear nylon comfortably.

“We can’t speak a word of Ital-
ian, no French, and only a little
German,” Betty said. But the girls
don’t,consider the language barrier
a problem even though they’ll
probably have to resort, to sign
language at times.

Plan Different Trips

Although Betty and Adele would

like to be together for the entire

trip, a great portion of the time
will be spent apart. Betty is plan-
ning to take part in the Interna-
tional Relations Tour. On the tour

 the Spring . . .

Colleges all over the place are witnessing just now a
phenomenal upsurge of light-hearted, if somewhat felonious,
highjinks on the part of the students. There are “I Go Pogo”
rallies down East, for instance; panty raids which are be-
coming epidemic in frequency, and here at home, .the swip-
ing of the IF “All Points” trophy and the DTD’s notorious

and ill starred Sweepstakes fraud.

_ The whole trouble is, it’s Spring, and the rising sap
symbolic of the time must allow some room in nature’s
scheme of things for the rising ire of the college clean, the
sky-ﬂung shouts of outraged fraternity, and the soaring
pennant of the" purloined panty. In short, the College Cam-
pus, USA, has felt the full impact of the cosmic forces set
in motion by the vernal equinox. And there’s no telling what
will happen next, for it’s pretty obvious that all those
felonies are substitutes for, or maybe even supplements to,
a lot of other felonies committed in the quiet shadows of a

roadside parking spot.

it seems useless to either criticize or condone any of
this, since Spring is going to come no matter what, so we
devote this space to giving hindsight advice to the Delts,
whose attempt to walk off with the Sweepstakes prize
showed commendable Springly spirit, but a depressing lack

of foresight and planning.

Your little fraud would have gone "off without a hitch
if you had payed some attention to the axiom that stood
Hitler in such good stead in his heyday. To wit: If you tell a
lie, make it a big one, then everybody believes it.

There’d have been no quesions» asked if you had dressed
your man in something appropriate to the speed of the cart.
An interplanetary rocket suit with an atomic “S” blazoned
on the cape would have been effective. And a high-altitude
ﬂying outﬁt, complete with oxygen mask, sheep-lined. boots,
and seat—pack parachute would have wowed ’em. Or maybe
pa blazer, white peaked cap, goggles, and face mask would
lhavegbeen more in keeping with the heat of the day.

Then everyone would have thought it was part of the
act, you’d have captured the prize, and all would have gone
home happy. You missed a great chance. .

There are probably as many
Ways of judging this University
as there are people willing to
judge it—-and many rise to the
challenge. One method, as yet
unexpressed and possibly un-
used, might take the number of
profs cited by
the House Un-
American Ac-
tivities Com‘
mittee as a
yardstick. We
could use the
ﬁgure to de-
termine either
our success or
failure, this
according to
your opinion 
of that com-
mittee.
 But none of our profs has man-
aged to get cited by that com-
mittee and so .we must dispense
with the citation yardstick. This
throws our judging awry but of-
fers us” the comforting thought
that we are getting knowledge
from a loyal staff, or, if not loyal,
at least an extremely clever
bunch and who are we to de-
tract from talent. This total ab-
sence of Pitt men from the com-
mittee’s public activities places
our staff almost on the level of
one composed entirely of ex-
communists but not quite. We
probably have some ex-New

 

, _ Dealers but they don’t have near

the class the ex-commies have.
No Surprise
I don’t suppose Pitt’s failure to
get any men cited will come as
a surprise to many people but to
, some it must sound untrue. I re-
fer, of course, to those patriots
who came out of hidingwhen Dr.
» Counts came to town and to
many others who have professed
seeing subversives lurking behind
every column in the Commons
Room. They have the ﬁrm con-
viction that Pitt harbors some
reds and a great many pinks and
that we would cast them out if
we only knew they were here.
During my four years here I
have never heard a prof express
an opinion that went beyond the
bounds of conventional Demo-
cratic liberalism. But I have
h j. . .

  

some express‘ opinions that -

    

s Cited  

so JENSEN

might sound radical and even red
to a William McKinley Repub-
lican or a Daughter of the Amer-
ican Revolution or even General
Douglas MacArthur. But these
opinions were all reflections of
current political differences and
were being thrashed out in the
arena of political and public
opinion. Obviously a man who

advocates social security sounds

like a communist when he is be-
ing judged by a Hoover Repub-
lican.

Results Dangerous

But the danger to the Univer-
sity and to the couhtry comes not
from the judging but from the
results of it. Last winter Penn-
sylvania legislated‘ itself a loy-
alty oath and now our profs must
be -certiﬁed annually by the
Chancellor. A loyalty oath would
not be quite so galling if it were
directed at aliens or at least at
people who were born in other
countries but when citizens born
and reared in this country must
standup and swear that they are
loyal to it, someone is sick and
it is not the person who takes the
oath.

Here we live in a vast, fecund
and beautiful land, powerful be-
yond the dreams of our fore-
fathers and free beyond anything
man has ever experienced and
yet we let the rancorous hates
and deadening fears of a few
wretched cowards throttle our
humanity and blot out our prin-
ciples.
has almost attained a philosophi-
cal divineness we permit a few
cankers on society to destroy it.
Now we bow to every ill-wind
that ‘enforces conformity.

Pride Unfounded

And this is one reason why
Pitt should not feel overly proud
of its clean record with the
House Un-American Activities
Committee. We ought to have a
few gentlemen cited for then we
might be certain that conformity
is not king here. Most of the
really inﬂuential schools in the
country have more than a few
citations to their credit.

Liberals Called Cowards

Policyils Personal. Too '

*A dramatic, and disquieting
motion picture called “Viva
Zapata” is playing at some local
movie houses these days.

It is disturbing, because it as-
serts the diluteness of our citi-
zenship, the cowardice of plac-
ing in t h e
hands of elect-
ed officials the
determining of "'
the future.

Brieﬂy, “Vi- ;
va Zapata” is
about a far-
mer who will
not be put off _
by a slow and L
corrupt go V-
ernment when
he asks for the
return of land‘ which has been
unjustly taken away from him
and his neighbors. He rejects
due process in favor of the
machete and eventually. gets
shot for it.

Well, this is not Mexico in 1910
under the oppression of Porﬁrio
Diaz. This. is the United States
in 1952, and the government is
not oppressive but it "may well
be inept, and the issue of per-
sonal responsibility for its poli-
cies is the same.

That personal responsibility for

 

the future—the feeling on the
part of each citizen that United
States policy rests in his hands
alone, literally and not only in
the rhetoric of expansive Fourth
of July orators-—-that feeling is

not with us, and widespread
cowardice is the reason why.

Liberal Has a Job

Mainly, th e cowardice is
chargeable to the liberals, at
least on the big question of peace
or else in our time. Because they
are the ones who have read So-
viet history and have come to
the conclusion that it is not all
darkness at noon, and that if war
comes it will be attributable as
much to ineptitude on the part of
the United States as to a lust for
power on the part of the Krem-
lin.

The conservatives, those who

are willing to take at face value,

the total depravity of the Polit-

buro or can convince themselves ,

of it, cannot fairly be charged
with cowardice for tacitly sup-
porting a foreign policy based on
that estimate of Joe Stalin and
his friends. A

But the liberal should take a
trip down to Washington and tell
some congressmen to convince
Harry Truman to meet with Joe

‘JACK MARKOWITZ

Stalin on the subject of peace:
Or else he should bring his feali *

of our foreign policy’s not being

completely right out of his head.

and tell some people on the street!

about it, and stop trembling about

the name-callers dubbing himr 1
Red. '

He Goes to Forums A A

Instead, today’s liberal tries to
do what he can for world peace
by going to Foreign Policy Asso-
ciation forums on peace, and
later asking the guest speaker,
“But,

to write a letter” to a congress-
man.

Most of the time, the liberal is
content to cast his one liberal

vote in November for the man *
he thinks will best do his own‘

job for him. Thus, representa-
tive government, which is a
blessing and a protector of free-
dom, gives each citizen a way
out, instead of making him as-
sert personally the right as he
‘sees it.

Under a system of government
which permits free discussion and
dissent, the people, and mainly

the liberals, can take the whole '

blame if war comes, and they
didn’t do a thing, except cast
vote, to prevent it. -

Delts Protest Decision

Last Friday night, the first place trophy for the
Spring Festival sweepstakes contest was awarded

deserving of it.

In the future, we suggest that the Festival com-

Delta Tau Delta feel that this action was not only

unjust, but deﬁnite evidence of the lack of proper

rules for the sweepstakes contest.

We have been accused of using a car built at
Carnegie Tech and a Tech driver.

As to the car, there is no rule pertaining to
the builder or building, of the car used’ in com-
petition._ It has happened quite often in the past
that cars not built by local chapters have been

used...

Now, in regard to the driver, no one can prove

If the contest were under I.F. rules, we protest
that we’ were not permitted to enter three entries,

If the contest was under Spring Festival rules,
we -claimt‘~.-that the driver need not be from Pitt
anymore than the band members in the Carnival

show . ..

In view of these facts, we feel that the ﬁrst
place trophy by right belongs to Delta Tau Delta,

nPateIlos:Johnny-on-the-Spot

By DON SCHURMAN

A popular conception that a jack-of-a11-
trades can be a master of none is emphati-
cally being disproven by Pitt's John Patellos.

For although the three—year track star com-
petes in ,more events than any of his teammates,
he is also Coach Carl Olson’s leading point-
getter.

“He’s the best all-around man on the team,”
says Olson. “We can usually count on John for
15 points a meet.”

34 Points Scored
And, according to the records, Olson’s praises
are not unrngrited. Competing in the broad jump
and the 100 and 220-yard sprints, Patellos has
amassed 34 points in four meets.
At present, his total is pacing the team, and it
seems likely that he will retain the point-winning
title he won last year as a junior.

Last year, however, he also made several show-
ings in the javelin throw. “But he almost threw
his arm out against Notre Dame,” says Olson, “and
so we're keeping him to three events.”

Nittanies Bow

Only 21 years old and a senior in physical edu-
cation, Patellos co—captains the thinclads besides
his other duties. ‘

Last Saturday, he was a key factor in Pitt’s
long overdue 77-54 victory over Penn State. He
scored eight’ points while his teammates whipped
the Nittanies for the ﬁrst time since 1941.

It was the third win for the Panthers as against
only one loss. Only one more dual meet now re-

mains ahead of the thinclads——at Virginia on Fri-
day.

Three Gridders Given

One-Year Deferments

By BORIS IWEINSTEIN‘ ‘
The combined efforts of the Army and Marine reserve
units helped to wreck two Pitt football teams in 19,50 and
1951, and if the Navy reserves had succeeded in grabbing
three ﬁrst-string varsity gridders this spring, the military

might have wrecked another.

‘ Sophomore Halfback Lou Cimarolli, Center Gabe Gem-
barosky, and Linebacker George Glagola have received,

student deferments from their lo-6

cal draft boards till next Febru-
ary. .

At that time the gridders will
apply for a further deferment to
complete their schooling.

Had Induction Orders

Prior to» their deferments,
though, the trio was scheduled to
report for induction at Bainbridge,
Md., this spring.

Linebacker Joe Schmidt and
Guard Tony Romantino are also
members of the same reserve unit
but did not receive orders for mil-
-itary induction.

‘ All ﬁve gridders ﬁgure promi-
nently in Coach Lowell “Red”
Dawson’s plans next fall. Their
departure would have depleted
the squad’s veteran manpower.
Lost Three Fullbacks

Accordixig to Charles Ebert, as-
sistant athletic director, “the boys
simply ﬁlled out the attached green
forms that arrived with their or-
ders, and wrote away for a stu-
dent deferment. “We,” he empha-
sized, “didn’t enter into their cor-

panies have contacted us, but to

with negotiations.”

Last year a proposal to broad-
cast Panther basketball games
from the Field House was turned
down by Atlantic and other com-
panies, but now the way is open
for a football—basketball package
deal, if a suitable one is available.
' It is reported that the University
received a yearly payment in the

TV Controls Hurt
_ The general reason given for
Atlantic’s withdrawal after 16
years of college broadcasting is
traced to the competition of tele-
vision and the stringent TV con-

trols of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.

Therefore, the company an-
nounced its intention of operating
in professional football exclu-
sively.

The action leaves the status of
Woody Wolfe, 13-year veteran of
Panther sportscasting, to the dis-
cretion of the new sponsor only
partially, since the school also ap-
proves the announcer. ,_

. Other Schools Affected

Pitt is but one of the many
schools aifected by the surprise
move, which was announced in
Philadelphia last Sunday.

Penn State, for one, expects
some difﬁculty in obtaining a
backer, since it is not located in
an industrialized area.

Meet Western Reserve

Sur prising, M ittmen Roll On

The Panther nine will have a.
week’s idleness behind them when
they journey to Cleveland Satur-
day for a double-header with
Western Reserve. , '

Monday’s game at Washington
and Jefferson became the sixth
washogt of the year instead of vic-
tory number seven for Coach Mit-
terling’s surprising crew.

A repetition of last season’s
double win over the Clevelanders
would boost the won-lost record to
eight and four, provided that the
opposition hasn’t improved as
much as the Panthers.

Such optimism’ is hardly out of
line, considering that last Satur-
day the Mittmen completed the

In 1950 Pitt lost fullbacks Paul

Five other gridders were slated

never were recalled.

Last year, Chess and Bill Sichko
returned to Pitt from the Marines
but failed to regain their pre-

ond-round today with four teams
remaining. Pi Lambda Phi was
last year’s winner.

The softball schedule has been
hampered by bad weather and as
a result the teams will be playing
step-up schedules until -the play-
offs.

Swimmers Beat Tech

Meanwhile, the IF tennis and
golf tournaments may be dropped
from the spring sports program if
the softball games are not played
off soon. -According to Herb Mc-
Gibbeny, acting intramural direc-
tor, “the teams would rather ﬁnish
the softball leagues rather than
these other sports since it offers
more points toward the IF tro-
phyfs

Intramural swimming went in-
tercollegiate last Monday when a
group of mermen from Pitt visited
Carnegie Tech. The Pittites came

Qukes Next

The Panthers will be out to win
the City golf championship next
Tuesday when they take on the
Duquesne Dukes at the Shannopin
country club.

The linksmen trounced Carnegie
Tech, 16-2, in a driving rain at the
Field Club on Monday without the
help of Captain Bob Reilly, and
out-pointed a weak Geneva team
on Tuesday.

Reilly was unable to compete in

Monday’s match when he was re- '
fused permission to» miss a chem- .

istry exam. » _
It made little difference on the
outcome of the match, however,

as only Bob ’McCarthy dropped ,

points to the Tartans. Norm
Figura, who replaced Reilly as
number one man for the match,
ﬁred a 76 to haul down medalist
honors.

The golfers now boast an ex-
cellent 8-1 chart.

Hardman, Joe Depelhever, and
Bob MacDonald. Hardman also i
placed second in the backstroke
while Depelhever won the breast-
stroke and MacDonald came in
second in the 50-yard free style.

The other Pitt winners were:
Bill Furrer in the 150 yard free
style, Tom Burns in the 100-yard
free style, and Sam Millstone in
the individual medley. Ed Basch,
who captained the Pitt squad, had
a second in both the breaststroke
and individual medley.

Diving was eliminated from the. P

meet since Tech had no contest--

Teacher Job C urb Decried‘

"The American Civil Liberties
Union in a new statement of its
position on academic freedom said
that it is opposed to any ban
against employing teachers solely
because of their political beliefs,
such as Communist or Fascist.

It asserted, however, that it did

not oppose the ouster or rejection
of a teacher found lacking in pro-
fessional integrity.

The union’s statement was
drawn up and printed in pamph-
let form by its academic freedom
committee.

32 Year-Old WSGA Is Center

Of University Activitie

By ELINORE STONE I

With little regard for the lengthy objections of men at
Pitt who disapproved of a Women’s move for independence,
the Women’s Self Government'Association was christened

in March of 1920.

It’s birth came as a result of junior Rose Feine’s trip
to an Inter-Collegiate Student Government conference, upon
the suggestion of Dean Thyrsa W. Amos in the fall of 1919.

This meeting gave Miss Feine theO~——-—

idea for a women's governing body
at Pitt. WSGA materialized from

Rose’s idea, and she became its
first president.

In 1921 a constitution was adopt-
ed and WSGA was officially estab-
lished to “ . . . foster a spirit of
Loyalty to the University, sponsor
the University ideal for women
students, and develop the tradi-
tions . . . and coordinate the or-
ganized activities of women .. .”

32-Year History

During its 32-year history, a
score of activities and traditions
have come to surround this gov-
erning body. Orienting freshmen
women is one of its biggest tasks.
From the green armband ceremony
held during Freshman Week, to the
Guild Party at the end of their
first year, the new Pittites are
guided by WSGA.

Lantern Night, established in
1921, is the oldest of existing

% Women’s traditions. The most no-

, table and impressive annual high-
jlight of the WSGA program is
;Coronation of the Senior Queen,
i first enacted in 1925.

' ‘Wac’s’ Here in ’43

The appearance of the “WAC’s”
brought the war a bit closer to
Pitt in ’43. They weren’t Uncle
Sam's women’s corps but the
members of WSGA’s War Activi-
ties Committee.

This committee recruited girls
for employment in the Cathedral
to relieve the labor shortage.

The existing policy for the
twelfth ﬂoor, limiting it to wom-
en’s use, was established in 1947.
Last year, Mrs. Clifford Heinz do-
nated an ultra—modern kitchen for
women on the twelfth ﬂoor. Lo-
cal companies contributed the nec-
essary pots, pans and dishes to
complete it. '

WSGA commission, the policy
making body of the group, jour-

I

S, Traditions

neyed to White Sulphur Springs,
Pennsylvania, before school open-
ed last fall to plan the year's ac-
tivities. They plan to repeat the
sojourn next year.
Book Drive Successful

This year" has been packed full of
events as per usual. WSGA col-
lected one-sixteenth of all the
books sent from the U. S. to the
University of Free Berlin. Pitt’s
was the largest single donation to
the drive.

A fashion show, Woman’s Day,
Vocational Fair, and Activities
Registration were a few of the ad-
ditional high spots.

They maintain a student loan
fund, sponsor the housing board,
freshmen council and high school

relations p r o g r a m s, co-sponsor _

mixer dances, and publish the
Vade Mecum.

They even have a Senior Court
to make sure everything’s legal.
