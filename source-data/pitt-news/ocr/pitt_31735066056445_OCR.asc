night. "
Guest speaker Isabel Fabian of the
Melinda Anaya Montes Women’s

Movement in El Salvador urged the crowd
before the march to continue the fight
against sexual violence.

“Women have the right to be respected
and to decide what we want to do. If we
don’t want to have sex, we don’t have to 
if we do not organize it will be difficult to
achieve anything,” Fabian said.

According to Shira Hassan, co-president
of the University of Pittsburgh's Campus
Women’s Organization, 88 percent of col-
lege women experience sexual harassment
during their four years. One third to
one half of all women and one in seven
men were sexually assaulted in their child-
hood.

“At least one-twelfth of men surveyed on

That, of course, is the legal definition of

said.

When asked about the biggest
improvement at Pitt since last
September, junior Tim Varley
says the first thing that comes to
his mind is transportation.

“During last year, it seemed
like the shuttle system went
from a single campus bus to an
entire network of shuttles to
every part of Oakland and even
Squirrel Hill,” Varley said. -“It’s

making an improvement like
that.” ~

Public Safety Chair Shahla
Eberhardt has been named as
the winner of the Governor’s
Award by the Pennsylvania
Commission on Crime and
Delinquency in Harrisburg. The
award is given to an individual
on the basis of outstanding con-

prevention. Eberhardt, a Pitt
senior currently in the Study
Abroad program in Denmark,
was represented by her mother
at an awards ceremony in
Harrisburg, Pa., according to
Sgt. Charles Grier of Pitt Public
Safety. 7 1

According to SGB advisor
Joyce Giangarlo, Eberhardt was

“Projects, especially large-
scale projects, are often started
by students who aren’t able to
complete them,” Giangarlo said.
“Shahla followed through on
several major projects. She is
one of the most creative and
resourceful people with whom
I’ve worked.”

Eberhardt was also responsi-
ble for developing and publish-
ing “Pitt Life 101,” a, student
safety guide which is currently 21

classes and is available to all
students in the SGB office. The
booklet, which is the first of its
kind at Pitt, recommends safe
routes on campus and gives
advice on topics such as sexual
assault and drug use.

Giangarlo said.

Alcohol

statistics
brought
to light

"By C. Chisholm

For The Pitt News

The effects of alcohol
and alcohol addiction
were some of the topics
covered lastnight at an
alcohol awareness semi-
nar sponsored by the
Health Education Office
and the Office of
Residence Life. This semi-
nar was held as a part of
National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week.

Lisa Katulis of the.
Health Education Office
spoke on some of the

effects of‘ alcohol addic-

tion. 4 -
According to Katulis,
the three leading killers of
people ‘in the United
States are heart disease,‘
cancer and alcohol-relat-
ed deaths, which include
alcoholism and drunk dri-
ving. Also, “alcohol is the
leading cause of death for
people ages 18-25,” said
Katulis. _

Coupons for free
gourmet cookies at the
Beehive were given away
for knowing statistics
such as “one out of every
two Pitt students has a
friend with a problem
with alcohol,” and “78
percent of Pitt students‘
prefer a drug—free envi-
ronment.”

Katulis also raised the
points that almost one-
fourth of Pitt students
drink alcohol rarely or
never, and that 90 percent
of Pitt students believe it’s
wrong to use illegal drugs
even if they make you
feel good.

First—year student Chris
Jasabe said, “I came
because I have a friend
who I think may be an
alcoholic, and I want to
help her.” According‘ to
Jasabe, the seminar
helped to raise his aware-
ness about alcoholism.

“Describe an alcoholic,”
Katulis asked. “Anyone

can become an alcoholic. _

It’s not just the bum on
the street or poor, unedu-
cated people on welfare.”
»Alcoholism is a devel-
opmental disease, accord-
ing to Katulis. What: starts
out as social drinking can
possibly turn into a more-

severe problem.

The Health Education
Office will be sponsoring
more activities through-
out the week on alcohol
awareness.Questions
about alcohol or drug
addiction can be
answered through the
Health Education ‘Office

at 648-1270..

This year was no exception to
another successful rush for Pitt
sororities and-fraternities —- the
best one yet for fraternities.

The number of fraternity
rushees went up this year from
240 to 262, the average number
of new pledges in each chapter
being 13.5.

“Fraternities with less than 20
new pledges had the option of a
month-long rush during
October to boost their num-
bers,” Inter-Fraternity Council
Internal Vice President Jason
Huey said. “The more [pledges]

all are.” .

For the sororities, new pledge
numbers remained about the
same. Even though last year’s
bids were up to 300 and this

-year only around 280, less peo-

ple dropped out keeping the
amount of actual pledges
around 270, according to
Panhellenic Association
President Lorraine Shipley.
“Overall everyone was satis-
fled, but smaller sororities will
have informal rush parties and
winter rush,” Shipley said.
Something new at this year’s
rush was the ice cream social

s say fall rush '93 was successful

a‘ each chapter has the better we

ties. In previous years, the
social was reserved for sorori-
ties only.

“The social put fraternities
and sororities together in a
group, [and] people formed
friendships that will continue to
strengthen Greeks as a whole,”
Shipley said.

Huey said having the social
together also let rushees know
that “Greeks are united.”

The “Hats Off To Going
Greek” seminar (Greek 101)
was also a great success during
the 10-day rush period.

A Huey said, “The event served
the purposes to educate pledges
about the Greek system, and

secondly [for them] to meet
people from other fraternities
[and sororities] and make friend-
ships that would hopefully last.”

Some topics discussed at the
day-long event were date rape,
alcoholism and teamwork,
according to Huey.

“It also gave us an opportuni-
ty to see why pledges picked
their particular chapter and their
opinions on rush.”

Huey said the theme “Go
Greek” was emphasized
throughout rush rather than
promoting individual fraternities

and sororities to show that-

“United, Greeks portray a pow-
erful image.”

ultimately ended up in front of

Boyle said that directly
confronting Murtha with possi-

ble campaign improvements
several years ago helped him I

get his position in Murtha’s

Boyle said that several years

ago, Murtha’s office handled

constituents’ complaints over

the phone, which proved inef-
fective after Murtha’s represent-
ed area nearly doubled when
Pennsylvania lost two congres-
sional representatives in 1990.

“There needed to be an advo-
cate in the area,” he said. '

“There simply was no per-
sonal touch.”

As a field representative,
Boyle drives to a different city
everyday in Murtha’s district to
meet with members of those
communities when Murtha can-
not.

“The needs of constituents are
great,” he said.

“Every day economic, social
and personal problems are pre-

The additional lighting
installed around the Cathedral
of Learning, William Pitt ;Union
and Hillman Library were also a
result of Eberhardt’s efforts,
according to Grier. He said
Eberhardt’s dedication earned
his respect. ‘

“I met with her once a week
while she was chair,” Grier said.
“She went with us to identify
areas of the campus which
needed lighting and helped us
work out the details. Her efforts,
such as the safety guide, helped
raise awareness all over cam-
pus.” C

One requirement of the
Governor’s Award is that the
individual’s actions must be
taken in a “good neighbor” situ-
ation with no material compen-
sation. .

“It is refreshing to deal with a
student like Shahla,” Officer
Karen Jones of Pitt Public Safety
said.

“She made a commitment

- and took action.”

Eberhardt also researched and
initiated a plan for a walking
escort service at Pitt. Due to" the
reach of the current transporta-
tion system, the walking escort
plan is being revised.

“Her idea for an escortlservice
was certainly the most detailed

plan of that kind to be consid-

Unite against violence
V Violence against-women, especially sexual violence,
has risen at an alarmingrate in the recent past.

Over 13 percent of women, who responded to a 1992
survey of student needs, said they had been forced to
have sex against their will since entering college.

Pitt is not anywhere near exempt from this problem.
Last year a female student returning home from a frater-
nity party on University Drive was brutally attacked and

lraped.“Two years ago a student was sexually assaulted
after being forced to leave Forbes Quad at gunpoint,

and just this past August a woman" was raped while

working in her university office. These are just a" few of '
I the reported assaults, and no one knows how many

incidents similar to these go unreported. ‘

These violent acts have caused student groups to act
to let the university and the city know that it is time to
do more to end the violence against women so preva-
lent in society. Unfortunately, it is only ‘after instances

of rape or sexual assault that such issues seem to
become important to the entire university community.

But these are issues that should be of concern -year.
round until more is done to help prevent such violence.

Last night organizations from Pitt, Carnegie Mellon
University and Chatham College marched in a joint
effort to protest acts of sexual violence against women.

“Take Back the Night” started with a rally at 8:50 p.m.
at CMU and then participants, holding signs and carry-
ing ﬂashlights, continued on to the William Pitt Union
where various participants made brief remarks. The

. event was co—sponsored by the CMU Women’s Center,
‘Pitt’s Campus Women’s.Organization and Chatham’s

Women’s Issues and Actions Committee.

Regular events like “Take Back the Night” will make
the message loud and clear that students will not accept
the battering and sexual assault of women or lawless-
ness on the streets. ' I ‘

According to Karen Pfefferle, in charge of publicity

for the Campus Women’s Organization, this event has .

become an annual event for her group, and since last
springs’ event was so successful, the group decided to
march once again sooner than expected. .

Cooperative‘ efforts, as displayed last night, are just
what, is needed to ensure action on the part of Pitt and
the city of Pittsburgh. But the cooperation should be

— not only among various colleges’ women’s organiza-

tions, but rather it should also be among various stu—
dent groups on Pitt’s campus. A S

For future projectsfsuch as “Take Back The Night,”
hopefully more campus organizations will choose to
help coordinate the event. CWO is not the only student

group that should be taking on the job of educating the

campus of the growing problem of violence against
women. This is an issue for the Student'Government

Board, Black Action Society, University Democrats and

College Republicans, as well as every other student
group on Pitt’s campus.

BAS must be open to white students

Although I had decided to no
longer add “fuel to the fire” in
the recent conﬂict between the
Black Action Society and the
Pitt campus, I feel I must
express these feelings. I would
like to call attention to the two
recent letters printed in The Pitt
News, one, by Mahdi Spruill and
one by Lea Griggs, and the
comments, “find out who you
are first, and then you can come
up to room 627*[BAS office] in
the William Pitt Union and see
me” and the implied notion that
“people haven’t been to room
627 of the William Pitt Union
one day in their life.”

Well, to this I must say that I
have been to the BAS office
(627 WPU) “one day in my life,”
one and only one. I was once

I very close to a strong member

of the BAS and was brought up
to the office this past summer. I

was told that I could come up

to the office because few if any
people would be there and that
otherwise I would not be wel-

come. I asked why and was told
by this well-respected BAS
member that the other members
of BAS would not approve of a
“silly, little, white girl” being in
the office.

I am a black studies major
here at Pitt, but I am also a
white student on campus who
does know who I am and

. Michelle J.
Babkes

where I came from. I believe

that all life was originally born
in Africa, and-I have a deep
respect for all African culture.

I also realize the sick injus-
tices that Europeans have com-
mitted in- the past toward
Africans, and the crimes that
continue to be committed
against black people across the
globe. Yet, I wonder if the BAS

really does want me to come
visit its office. I believe strongly
in the necessity for black orga-
nizations to have their own and
don’t even have a problem with
not being welcome at the BAS
office. _ '

I have learned to understand
the crucial need for black peo-
ple to have their own private
organizations where they can
educate and focus. on the needs
of their family.

I do not take it personally,
just as I have learned not to take
the loss of my closest friend at
BAS, who feels my “whiteness”
contradicts his black agenda, as
a personal attack.

Still, do you truly welcome
whites (who know who they
are or who are at least making a
concerted effort to find out) up
to your BAS office. My experi-
ence has proven otherwise.
With all due respect.

The competitive f'1r

Pitt's sophomore
tennis star thrives
in the heat of battle

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

To say Marlazielinski is competitive is
like saying Gone With the Wind is a nice
movie.

Waiting on a serve, Zielinski hops
from side to side while spinning her rac-
quet in her hand.

Eager for her opponent to serve the
ball, her liquid eyes glare like those of a
cowboyat high noon facing a ruthless
outlaw. ‘

The competitive fires burn deep in the
Pitt sophomore.

“I’m a very competitive person, playing
cards or tennis or anything else. I just
hate to lose,” Zielinski said.

Zielinski grew up in the small town of
West Pittston just outside of Wilkes-
Barre, Pa. 7

Living next door to a tennis court

’ sparked Zielinski’s interest in the game

oftennis.
Similar to many other athletes,

C Zielinski credits her parents with being

the biggest inﬂuence in her tennis life.
“Without my parents, I would never
have played tennis,” Zielinski said.
The love of competition drove her to
try out for her high school tennis team.

Making the team gave Zielinski her first

taste of real competition.
While attending Scranton Preparatory

O School, Zielinski experienced winning

on a daily basis. She was a four—time
member of a ’women’s tennis team that
won five consecutive section champi-
onships. ‘
Zielinski chose to attend Pitt over
other schools so she could experience

The clichés for a Steeler
stomping of the previously
unbeaten Saints are all used up.
Instead of finding creative “ways
to describe the Men of Steel’s
bashing of the men of Fleur De

Lis (see the Saint’s helmets), we _

can get on with the business of
figuring out what it means.

Simply, the Steelers are legiti-
mate Super Bowl -contenders
right now.

After Pittsburgh rolled to
three straight wins entering the
New Orleans contest, critics

pointed to the unimposing

opposition the team did it
against.

Sunday was supposed to
remove-all doubt. The Saints
were 5-0 and pounding people.

-The Steelers made an emphatic

statement by not only pulling
out a win against a good team
— they dominated one of the
NFL’s best. .
The Monday morning quar-

.vit.e.s;,;.;t.'».'-.‘..'-.'.'nu. -\'h . \ \

    

 

terbacks rose up again. The
Saints weren’t really that good‘
they said. O

No greater authority than Eric
Dickerson said their run
defense was weak. Never mind
that Dickerson is just a mop—up
player these days and has little
opportunity to find out who
can play.

Let’s’ get real here. The
Steelers were stifling. They
rolled up five sacks against an
offensive line that had given up
only a total of seven in the first
five games. . -

They gave up only 49 yards
rushing per contest on 2.9

yards -per carry against what.

had been the league’s best run-
ning attack.

Wade Wilson, a solid veteran
who had been second in the
league in passing through five
weeks, was an awful six of 23
with three interceptions. The
Steelers did all of this with_their

best defensive lineman, Gerald
Williams, on the sideline with a
knee‘ sprain. ’

More important for the
Steelers is the running game is
getting in gear. They took some
time to adjust to..the loss of Pro
Bowl guard Carlton Haselrig,
but replacement Justin

,  Ryan
Buncher

Strzelczyk and company are
now paving the way for Barry
Foster and Leroy Thompson no
matter the opposition. The
Steeler offense was effective
against a solid defense despite
an uninspiring day from quar-
terback -Neil O’Donnell and
some ugly drops from tight end
Adrian Cooper. (Still think he is

as good as Eric Green?)

. - - 4 . » - ,

Don’t forget the Year of the
Kicker Update.

As field goals have taken
center stage this season, Gary
Anderson has been a quietly
perfect 11 for 11, including
three on Sunday.

The argument is that the
Saints are not Dallas so don’t

get so excited. Actually, New-

Orleans is not that far behind
the defending champs.

Besides, we’re talking about
the battleto represent the
Awful Football Conference in
the Super Bowl — not actually
winning the thing.

There are plenty of obstacles. .

A loss in Cleveland this Sunday

would put an AFC Central title r

in doubt. Joe Montana’s magic
makes the Chiefs dangerous.
Then there are the Bills, every
bit the demon to Pittsburgh as
San Francisco has been to the
Saints. _

Steelers have the look of a
team that will come marching
in when it is all said and done.
°From a team on the rise, to
two teams on the top. Could
there be a better battle of out-

standing -talent and under-'

whelming managing than this
year’s World Series? The mental.
capacity of Toronto manager
Cito Gaston has found its way
into this space before and is
back again.

Gaston benched American
League batting champion John
Olerud for game three — with
designated hitter Paul Molitor
taking over at first. What about
playing him at third in place of
Ed Sprague?

So what if it has been a while —

since Molitor played there. He
spent most of his careerat
third.

ll’z'tt volleyball lacks big-gum

By Ryan Buncher
‘Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team was

‘uncharacteristically silent on

the bus ride to its match against
the Hofstra Flying
Dutchwomen Saturday after-
noon, but Panther Coach Cindy

Braziel said she was not wor-

ried.
Regardless of state of mind,

Pitt was not facing topflight

competit_ion. The Flying
Dutchwomen had been
grounded in 12 of their 20
matches up to that point in the

season, including a relatively‘
easy sweep by the Panthers at

Hofstra on Sept. 17.

A few hours later it was
-Braziel who was all but silent,
speaking veiy little and only in
whispers. Pitt had found a way
to lose to the lowly
ljutchwomen.

The Panthers had been
through ups and downs all sea-
son, but no loss hit harder than
this one. It was one more
example of deficiencies that
have cost the team all season.

Braziel did not address the
defeat until later in the day.

“The play [in the Hofstra
match] was uninspired,” Braziel
said. “It was without question
the worst match of the year. It’s
difficult to process that in light
of the fact that we are already
halfway through the season,
there’s an emotional level that
we haven’t mastered yet. The
Hofstra match proved that.

“Unfortunately, I’m saying
things that I was saying earlier
in the year.”

One thing the Pitt coaches
have been talking about since
the opening weekend of the
season at Penn State is defense.

‘At that point, they were sur-

game is something we can con-
trol a lot more,” Braziel said in
the Sept. 7 issue of The Pitt

News. “You either have the

attackers or you don’t, and you
can train the defensive aspect.”

Assistant coach Brian Begor
said that a team with Pitts size
needs to be outstanding on
defense to be great. That has
not happened, as defensive
problems burned the Panthers
again this past weekend.

“We didn’t have problems
with [defense], we just didn’t
do it,” Braziel said of Pitt’s loss
to New Mexico last Friday
night.

 T‘Defense is desire. It is not

technique. It is ﬂat out, ‘I want
it more than you do.”’

As far back as two weeks
ago, the team’s focus had been
on beating a solid Lobo squad.
Pitt was emotionally out of the
match early, getting blown
away in the first two games.
When the players got going in
the third game, they seemed to
tighten up too much. The
Panthers lost in four games.

“For some reason, when we

g get in the big games our emo-

tional level is not where it
needs to be to compete,”
Braziel said. “There is an opti-
mal level of anxiety when you
are performing at a high level.
When we work to that point,
we can’t maintain it. We go
past it and out of control.

“We peak and valley. You
are ‘not going to win against
good teams [doing thatl.”

Earlier in the season, Begor
pointed to the importance of
matches against relatively even
opposition like New Mexico.

“What’s critical is our rubber
matches,” Begor said. “This
team is still learning. [T he play-
ers are] trying to find their level
of mental toughness. Tiying to
get over the edge. ’

Persistence pays for Pitt cornerback Maurice W/illiams

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

The year 1991 was the first
year Maurice Williams walked
onto the Pitt football team. He
was a funny sight to see_—
standing 5—feet, 11-inches and
weighing 150 pounds. Williams

resembled a bean pole with

baggie pants on.

At first glance I thought he
was the Rodney Dangerfield of
college football. He got no
respect.

Williams, who always had his
mind set on developing into a
Division I defensive back,
never got his chance. Instead
he was told to learn the plays
as a scout team running back.

In the jbacklof his mind, he
was beginning to second-guess
himself as a football player.

“‘I felt like giving up all the
time,” Williams said. “I went
through practice getting beat
up day after day with no one
saying anything to me. A lot of
times I wanted to quit. They
never told me that I wasn’t
going to play  they just never
gave me the opportunity to
play.” I

But the walk-on wouldn’t
quit because he knew that was
everything his hard-working
and humble parents stood for.

E. Phillip and Rose Marie
Williams kept reminding their
son that they were not going to
let him give up his dream.

They told him, “Since you
started. it, you are not going
give up that easily. If you quit,
you will be a quitter for the rest
of your life.” ’

Now, standing six feet tall
and weighing 180 pounds, the
standout cornerback is happy
he took his parents’ advice.

After outplaying sophomore
Anthony Dorsett during sum-

mer camp, Williams won the ,

starting right cornerback posi-
tion and a full—time scholarship.
Since the season started, he has
38 tackles —— including 28

Zielinski—.

Cont. from page 7
any style of play bests describe

I Zielinski’s game. -

Even in practice, Zielinski’s
desire to be the best comes
shining through.

_“She workshard from the
time she gets to the Cost Center
until she leaves. She is very
coachable and always gives 110
percent every practice,”
Dieffenbach said.

Even in her free time, there is
no slowing down for‘her.
Although undeclared at the
moment, Zielinski plans on
majoring in business.

“I hopelto be a very success-
ful business woman and have a
family,” Zielinski said. “I’ll
never give up playing tennis
completely though.” ,

Knowing her competitiveness
and solid work ethic, one can
only feel sorry for anyone
opposing Zielinski whether it
be on a tennis court or in a
boardroom.

After all, Zielinski doesn’t
take a back seat to anyone.

probably as far or further than
our expectations,” Pitt defen-
sive back coach Tim Lewis
said. “He made a decision over
the summer to lift weights and
come back and try to play tech-
nical football. He is a good
young fellow who is really
working hard.”

“I don’t know what the aver-
age walk—on is like. All I know
is that Maurice is a heck of a
football player and is develop-
ing into an even better football
player every snap he takes. I
just hope he continues ‘along

\ ’ these lines.

“He is _a good leader on the
field,-and he tries to get the
guys psyched up, not by his
voice but by the way he plays.
He is very alert, very aware of
what people think about him.
He wants people to think he is
doing a good for us,” Lewis
said.

Even though Williams is lead-
ing the Panthers in three differ-
ent defensive categories, he is
still not satisfied with his per-

9

sonal and team performance.

“I’m tired of losing,” Williams
said. “I want the team to get
better.” ’

Personally, _ Williams has eyes
set on intercepting more pass-
es.

“Before the season started I
set a goal for five,” Williams
said. “I ﬁgure if I. get five in my
first ‘year of starting, that’s a
half-decent job. I have two
[interceptions] now, but I really
Want to run one back for a
touchdown. If I run one back, I
could do a little something 

' something in the end zone.”

When Williams first walked
on he had set five goals for
himself: walk-on, playing time,

scholarship, starting and inter-

cepting five passes.

He has achieved the first four
and is confident of achieving
the ﬁfth.

Next year his goal is to win
the Jim Thorpe award as the
best defensive back in the
country. This time no one is
laughing at Maurice Williams.

Isn’t comparing a meeting of
two teams, with one win
between them, to a world war
a bit of a stretch? '

The real question is who is
crying more, newborn Scott
Cooper Williams or new daddy

for missing the game.

Ryan Bzmcber is a Senior
Staff Writer for T be Pitt News.

opponents.”

That has not happened
yet for the Panthers. They
lost to a solid Kansas
team days after Begor’s
comments.

Injuries and the lack of
depth weakened the
team earlier in the sea-
son, but that has
changed. '

Alyssia Yanik and
Carrie Thornton recently
returned from injuries,
although neither is 100
percent. Ann Marie
Lucanie hurt her ankle
this Weekend, and Jennie
Driscoll is having prob-
lems with her shoulder,
but all 11 players partici-
pated in a match for the
the first time all season
against Hofstra.

Talent and technique
are not the problems for .
the Panthers. They
returned every starter
from a solid 1992 squad.

“Technically and athlet-
ically, we“re there,”
Braziel said. “Right now
we’re not manufacturing
the drive that is going to
translate into wins. We
can’t seem to get a han-
dle on it. It's frustrating."

The most telling
remarks may have come
from New Mexico head
coach Laurel Brassey.

“I thought Pitt was not
as good as they were last

u

year,“ Brassey said.
