THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SINCE 1906

Pennsylvania public Iuilion
among highest in nation

Lisa Grzyboski

Staff Wrlter

An Ohio state resident attending Ohio
State University this school year pays $3,879
for tuition and fees.

A West Virginian matriculating at West
Virginia University pays $2,412 for yearly
tuition costs.

The tuition for a student living in
Pennsylvania and currently enrolled at Penn
State University’s main campus — $6,040.

For anyone not doing the math,
Pennsylvania residents wanting to attend this
state’s largest public university pay more
than two times the amount West Virginians
pay and more than $2,000 more than neigh-
boring Ohio residents pay for attending their
state’s public imiversity.

And it isn’t just Ohio and West Virginia

I that beat Pennsylvania public-university

prices. According to an American
Association of State Colleges and
Universities report, 46 other states have pub-
lic universities with lower tuition costs than
those of the Keystone State.

“One of the facts we continue to present

to the [Pemisylvania] General Assembly is
that Pemisylvania continues to rank in the
bottom ﬁve states in terms of per capita sup-
port for higher education,” said Ann
Dykstra, director of commonwealth rela-
tions for Pitt. “The percent increases have
not kept pace with those of other states.”

Higher Ed

 

Tomorrow:
I-low lawmakers are thinking
about tackling the problem

In 1aymen’s terms, because the state
isn’t shelling out more money for higher
education, Pennsylvania students currently
attending the state’s public universities have
to shell in more. And students and parents
paying for the coveted diploma all too often

know what that means — high tuition costs.

Pitt students are not excluded from the
heartache. After a 4-percent hike this ﬁscal
year, tuition and required fees for in—state stu-
dents going to school in Oakland now stands
at $6,164, the most expensive in public high-
er education in Pennsylvania. In—state stu-
dents attending Pitt’s satellite campuses
aren’t faring much better, with tuition differ-
ences ranging from the $10 less Pitt
Johnstown students pay to $246 less for stu-
dents at the rural Titusville campus.

“Like everyone else, we would prefer
lower tuition levels,” said Robert Pack, vice
provost of academic planning and resource
management, to a panel of state representa-
tives sitting on the Subcommittee on Higher
Education this past summer. “But, given the
environment in which we operate, we
require the revenue that tuition generates.”

This is something students hear ﬁom
the moment they step on campus to the
moment they step on the stage to receive
their diploma. Even students studying at the
state’s most funded public universities must

In Oakland, Santa’s elves don’t
wear little green suits with pointy
shoes, they wear blue. They don’t
carry hammers, nails or paint
brushes, they carry guns. They
don’t ride in a sleigh, they ride in
police cruisers.

In Oakland, Santa’s elves are
Pitt police officers.

This year, with holiday spirit,
they put up a Christmas tree in the
department’s lobby, decorated with
paper tags shaped like angels and
snowmen.

Each tag bore the name of a
local child, and each of the officers
picked one or two of the more than
100 tags and bought gifts that will

When Mary Ellen Pohl Rodgers and
her husband couldn’t decide where to live,
they ﬂipped a coin. She lost, and they fol-
lowed the location of his job offer.

Although navigating uncharted tenito—
ry in her new home, Rodgers was never
afraid of her own professional future. She
was always fascinated with people and
knew she could make it.

Rodgers, vice president and chief
ﬁnancial ofﬁcer at American Home
Patient, said her leadership management,
drive for perfection and ability to balance
multiple tasks has rriade her the success she
is today.

“What we [women] have worked so
hard for is choice,” Rodgers said. For
women to succeed, they need to gain a bet-
ter understanding of themselves, she
added.

Everyone has a different View of what
happiness is, but most people agree that
ﬁnancial stability is a large part of success,
both professionally and personally.

Of Pitt’s 3,231 seniors, 1,709 are
women, and most of them are here to get
their fair share of the American dream.

Education, $4,265 was the average tuition
last year among the 14 schools which com-
prise the system.~This amount is still more
than what students in other states armually
pay to attend their state’s major public uni-
versity.

Much of the reason behind the higher
tuition costs in Pennsylvania directly relates
to the amount of money the Commonwealth
annually appropriates to higher education.

“Low-level appropriation leads to high-
level tuition,” said Ronald Cowell, an
Allegheny County Democrat who complet-
ed his term in Pennsy1variia’s House of
Representatives two weeks ago. “The long
tradition in this state in higher education is in
the private sector and not the public sector.

THE PITT NEws

Notre Dame upset with
logo posted on adult site

Michelle Krupa
The Observer

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (U-WIRE) -—
An Internet pornography site featuring a
Notre Dame logo changed its format
Thursday in
response to a cease—and-desist letter
from the university’s General Counsel’s
office, which alleged that the site com-
mitted trademark
infringement.

The site features nude photos of a
young woman called Lucki, who claims
she is a Notre Dame sophomore. The
logo appeared prominently with Lucki
on the Web page.

The administrator of the site was
not authorized to use the name or logo,
according to Bill Kirk, assistant vice
president for Residence Life. As of
Thursday, the  had been replaced
with an “SD” logo, presumably an
abbreviation for the “Sexy Dame”
theme that is the focus of the revised
page.

“It has been brought to the General
Counsel’s attention,” Kirk said. “The
use of the university logo is a violation
of the trademark law.”

Assistant Vice President for the
General Counsel’s office, Bill Hoye,
said a “cease and desist” letter was sent
to the site’s
administrator “informing them that we
know they’re using our trademark and
ordering them to remove the trade-
mark.” Hoye’s letter is posted on
Lucki’s Web page.

While he could not

discuss

specifics of the case because of the
attomey—client privilege, Hoye said that
in typical cases of trademark infringe-
ment the party illegally using the trade-
mark has to confirm in writing that it
has done so.

Now that the site has been changed,

the General Counsel’s office will assess
its satisfaction with the change and
decide if it will take legal action. Kirk
would not comment on whether the uni-
versity is seeking confirmation of the
woman’s status as a Notre Dame stu-
dent, nor did he say if the university is
investigating her identity.

“I truly hope that this young lady is
not a student at the University. I look at
this as a real pastoral concern,” Kirk
said.

He refused to speculate about the
potential rarriifications for Lucki if she
does attend Notre Dame.

Lucki was contacted via e—mail, but
as of press time, she made no statement
to The Observer. But rumors are
already ﬂying around
the Notre Dame campus as to her iden-
tity and about which people claim to
know her.

“I can’t believe the amount of atten-
tion that I’m receiving from you guys
on campus,” Lucki wrote on the new
Internet site. “As far as why you haven’t
seen me around, I try to keep a low pro-
ﬁle and wear the typical ND-girl ‘uni-
form’... the last thing I need is for
someone to recognize me - especially
the administration’s Nazis.”

The response from Notre Dame stu-
dents has been intense. On her site,
Lucki posts excerpts from e-mails sent
to her through the
Web page. Many support her decision to
pose nude as a Notre Dame student,
some are requests for interviews from
various media
outlets — and a few students wrote in
the hopes of snaring a formal date.

pany did not to respond to Observer
questions via e—mail, and no phone
number could be obtained for the orga-
nization.

Piﬂsburgh may adopt ”na kill” animal policy

Moran Elitsur and Sara Cagno

The Pitt News

Like Las Vegas and San
Francisco, Pittsburgh is considering
becoming a “No-Kill” city, in which
animal shelters refuse to kill unwant-
ed cats and dogs.

No—kill cities attempt to house
every homeless animal and limit
euthanasia to sick animals.

“Things have got to change,”
said Kathy Hecker, humane agent for
Animal Friends. “We [at Animal
Friends] care enough not to kill ani-
mals. We will close our doors, and
then [animal overpopulation]
becomes the community’s problem
 We’re dealing with little individ-
ual lives here. What we do with them
is an issue we all need to work on.”

Friends of Animals, and Activist
Debate Network, both Pitt organiza-
tions, held a recent panel discussion
on the future of Pittsburgh’s pets.

There, Hecker and Clay
Criswell, executive director of the
Western Pennsylvania Humane

Society, discussed the possibility of
becoming no-kill.

Criswell said a declaration by
Mayor Tom Murphy would be the
way for Pittsburgh to become a no-
kill city. Hecker, on the other hand,

said the power lies in the hands of
directors of city shelters. If shelters
in which city strays are housed
decide to adopt a no—kill policy, it
would reflect the sentiments of the
whole city. —

The goal of humane groups in
the city is to edu-
cate the public
about the issue of
animal overpopu-
lation, focusing on
neutering and
spaying projects
that prove fixing
animals is much
less costly than
killing them.

C r i s w e l 1
defined a no-kill
city as having
three categories of
animals: the adopt-
able, the treatable
and the non—reha-
bilitative. The
treatable animals
are moved up to
the adoptable cate-
gory when they are healthy enough,
and the animals without hope of
rehabilitation — such as those that
are extremely old, sick or bad tem-
pered — are euthanized.

She Said

Animal Friends, where Hecker
works, is Pittsburgh’s only no-kill
shelter. Animal Friends accepts all
animals as space allows and will
only euthanize animals with a termi-
nal or communicable illnesses. She
said she hopes her shelter’s policy
will soon become
that of the city as
well.

Her shelter
boasts a turnover
rate of one month
for dogs and only
slightly longer for
cats. She empha-
sized that no ani-
mal has ever died
of old age at
Animal Friends
and that the quality
of life for the ani-
mals at the shelter
is quite good.

“I dare say
the animals at the
shelter get more
attention than my
own pets at home,”
Hecker said.

Criswell stressed the need for the
public to become active in order to
make a difference in the lives of ani-
mals. Any city or state penalties for

refusing to spay or neuter family
pets would help control the animal
population, but this issue is not pop-
ular with legislators, he said.

When Hecker, in conjunction
with another animal group, tried to
film a euthanization of an animal to
capture the public’s attention, no
shelter would allow the filming on
its premises. Eventually, a chapter of
the Humane Society in another state
allowed the filming, which both
Hecker and Criswell are proud of.

“If this [film] is shock value,
then I’m into shock value,” Criswell
said. “It wakes people up.”

Criswell agreed with Hecker that
Pittsburgh should become a no-kil_1
city. He warns this does not mean
animals will not be euthanized. Just
as in the Animal Friends shelter, sick
animals will be “put down” to keep
the diseases from spreading within
the animal population.

She said the North Side shelter
has decreased euthanizing animals
by 55 percent from 11 years ago.
Shelters are also looking into adopt-
a-thons, spaying and neutering all
animals before adoption from shel-
ters, marketing the animals on the
Internet, and humanely trapping wild
cats to spay or neuter them before re-
releasing them.

Commission of the States, a Denver-based
group that analyzes education policy around
the country. He said that compared to
Califomia’s stratiﬁed system of higher edu-
cation, which breaks cleanly into three levels
of publicly funded schools, Pemrsylvania’s
system is a labyrinth. Because Pennsylvania
hassomanyfundingstreams—theState
System of Higher Education and its 14
schools; state-related universities Pitt, Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln; 15 community
colleges; and state-aided schools such as the
University of Pennsylvania supported for
their one-of-a-kind programs — money
oftentimes is spread too thin.

“In Pennsylvania’s case, you can say it
has taken on the added burden of multiple
layers of semi-state systems,” said Newman.

However, some contend the number
and kinds of schools increases the attractive-
ness of Pennsylvania higher education to
both in-state and out—of-state students.

“Weareveryhappyabouttlrebroad
range of opportunities in higher education in
Pennsylvania,” said Michael Poliakolf, a
deputy secretary in the state’s Department of
Education. “Some institutions go back to the
18th century. We have a range not many

THE PITT

states have in terms of public, private and
state-aided schools.”

He also said in addition to the $1.6 bil-
lion the state appropriated for institutional
support to Pennsylvania colleges and univer-
sities, the state allocated a large amount of
money to the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency for student
ﬁnancial aid

This ﬁscal year, 150,000 students will
receive state grant awards, amounting to
$267 million, said Keith New, PHEAA
spokesman. This represents a 7-percent
increase from last year and will enable qual-
iﬁed students to receive an average state
grant of $2,078. This is money that does not
have to be paid back

Poliakotf pointed out that according to a
1998 report published by The Chronicle of
Higher Education, Pennsylvania ranks
fourth in the nation in state spending for
ﬁnancial aid, a ﬁgure that should not be for-
gotten. He also said this is money that goes
directly to the student, not the school, which
allows students a greater ﬂexibility in decid-
ing which school to attend

While Cowell acknowledged that ﬁnan-
cial aid is an important factor in affording
higher education, he believes it is in the best
interest of all the students if money goes
directly to the state’s colleges and universi-

ties. He said only certain students qualify for
ﬁnancial aid, leaving many students who just
miss the cutoff and middle—class families
who still ﬁnd it hard to atford college costs
without support.

“We ought to give greater priority to
reducing tuition and fees at the undergradu-
ate level,” Cowell said. “I’ve argued for a
long time that we should make a larger
investment [to the universities].”

Poliakoff admitted Pennsylvania ranks
ﬁfth lowest in the country in terms of tax-
payers’ contributions to collegiate degrees
coming from public universities. Where the
taxpayers’ cost per degree is $10,0()0 in this
state, said Poliakolf, it rises to $27,000 in
California and $37,()()() in Nevada, states
with higher education systems dominated by
public universities. While this is good for
taxpayers in Pemrsylvania, it is less so for
struggling students.

“[Pennsylvania] is a relatively low-tax
state, which means resources must be spread
around,” Cowell said. "Ihis means there is a
relatively modest amount of money for
many competing interests.”

Add this to the fact that Pennsylvania
has the second-highest population of senior
citizens in the nation, as well as a blue—collar
worker mentality, and it helps explain why
taxpayers are loath to support more of their

dollars going toward higher education, said
Cowell, who also held the position of House
education committee minority chair in his
tenure as state representative.

Pennsylvania also has “more contention
and less clarity as to what the state role
should be in higher education,” said Charles
Lenth, director of policy studies for the
Education Commission of the States. This
becomes evident when the number of over-

Faces we'd like to see on the
new one-dollar coin

In an effort to properly redress the
staggering gender disparity in American
currency, the U.S. Mint set forth on a
mission: to ﬁnd the perfect woman for
the new .one—dollar coin. The discus-
sions went on for months, battles were
fought, tears were shed, all in the name
of honoring just one of the many
American women who have made this
country great.

No doubt names are already pop-
ping into your head: Harriet Tubman,
conductor on the Underground
Railroad, who helped many slaves ﬁnd
freedom; Sandra Day O’Connor, first
female chief justice of the Supreme
Court, who paved the way for others; or
even Eleanor Roosevelt, the ﬁrst lady
who transcended the role of president’s
wife to become a role model for mid-
century women.

The U.S. Mint chose Sacajawea
Sacajawea?

Yes, Sacajawea, the Shoshone
woman who, at the age of 16, guided
Lewis and Clark through the Louisiana
Territory. She carried her two-month-
old son on her back, endangering his life
as well as hers.

'I'hat’s just not very glamorous. It’s
not very patriotic or awe-inspiring,
either. The U.S. Mint needs to realize
that teen mothers with risky lifestyles
arejusttoodepressingtoput onacoin.

This is a brand—new American coin.
It should really represent American
society. America doesn’t want to think
about the Louisiana Purchase every
time it buys a Coke; historical infomra-
tion makes America’s head hurt.

Certainly, the government wants
the public to accept and maybe even
enjoy the new currency. Who knows, it
may even make people happier about
spending, thereby boosting the econo-
my. The U.S. Mint should therefore give
America what it wants: famous people.

What American housewife would
not like to be able to pay for Oprah’s
book club selections with Oprah dol-
lars?

Sex and nostalgia drive America
like no other force known to man. Coins
featuring popular 1980s sex symbols
such as Ms. Pac—Man, Smurfette or
Mary Lou Retton would draw “oo ”
and “ahs” until the ‘90s become popu-
lar.

And if the point is to provide role
models for young girls, the Mint should
simply tap into the existing bevy of
female stars they already look up to,
such as Hanson, Cotutney Love or the
WB p1ime—tirne lineup.

They may not have explored the
Louisiana Territory, but they have found
aplaceinourhearts—arrdperlIapsour

Musings on Jesse ”lhe Body” Ventura

A week ago, I heard a great joke on ‘The
Tonight Show.” Reﬂecting upon the election of
Jesse “The Body” Ventura as governor of
Minnesota and the aversion the American public
has for “professional politicians,” Jay Leno
asked a question: Would you get into a plane and
feel safe if the pilot walked into the cabin before
take-off and said, “Listen, I’ve never ﬂown an
airplane before. However, I have some new and
interestingideasabouthowtodoso,arIdifyou
stick with me, I think we can make it work?”

If you don’t want to put your life in the
hands of someone who lacks experience, then
why would you take pride in putting your eco-
nomic well-being in the hands of a total govem-
mental neophyte? That’s just what the voters of
Minnesota did when they elected Ventura gover-
nor. One would think that the voters of
Minnesota would feel some trepidation at the
idea of entrusting control of a $23 billion dollar
budget to a man whose sole experience in gov-
emrnent is a four-year term as the
mayor of Brooklyn Park. Now,

Public support for term limits has almost univer-
sal approval. People just don’t like politicians
and politics, seeing politicos as disingenuous
double-dealers and politics as an armoying dis-
traction. One can see the consequences of the
animus to career politicos manifest itself right
here in Pittsburgh. In this year’s race for the 14th
Congressional district, Republican candidate Bill
Ravotti assailed Congressman Bill Coyne as
being unqualiﬁed to represent Pittsburgh for,
among other things, having a pension.
Personally, I’ve never been able to under-
stand the logic behind tetrn  Our founding
fathers gave us the ability to limit the terms of
our political representatives. It’s called an elec-
tion. Most people complain about the culture of
power and corruption that revolves around
politicians, but term limits are a solution worse
than the problem. If I like the job that
Congressman Bob is doing representing me in

How to be a true American celebrity

Mark Campbell

columnist

Perhaps I think too much. Or perhaps
I’ve been watching far too much MTV
lately. But I’ve become completely fasci-
nated by the notion of fame in America of
late.

I’ve oorne to the conclusion that in
order to become famous in America these
days, you either have to be the best at
something or the worst. Either method will
give you fame, but being the worst is both
easier and much more lucrative. The worst
serial killers are the only killers we hear
about. Random murderers are relegated to
the section of the paper on page 11 called
“News Briefs,” while the truly perverse
and heinous killers warrant big headlines
on the front page, several pages of in—depth
reporting, and pictures ——- lots of pictures.
It doesn’t matter that their fame has been
gained through the senseless taking of
human life, because the line between fame
and infamy is so blurred that it seems to be
virtually nonexistent.

The reasons for this are simple. We
are constantly inundated with information,
to the point that we have become com-
pletely oblivious to anything but the
extreme. We really don’t care about poli-
tics (unless, of course, they directly affect
us) or the arts, unless there is something
that sparks some type of voyeuristic inter-
est in us. Did the vast majority of
Americans really care what was going on
in the White House until we discovered
that the president had been getting his own
private perks from an intern in the Oval

Oﬂice? Sadly, it is doubtful. The media
realize that we all have this prurient inter-
est and have latched onto it with great suc-
cess. I have a feeling that the ﬁlm “'Ihere’s
Something About Mary” became such a
huge critical and box-ofﬁce success
because people were so enamored by the
fact that there was (gasp!) semen in it.

This phenomenon is hardly new, but it
has reached fever pitch in the last half of
this century. People in
the entertainment
and, unfortunately,
news industries have
ﬁnally realized that
excess sells. As a
result, we have been
fed a pretty steady
diet of it ever since.
Seeing as I’m never
one to sit back and be
fed anything, espe-
cially media hype, I’d
normally advise
against subscribing to
the system’s ideology. _
Well, screw that. Become part of the sys-
tem. Fame and fortune are within your
reach; all you have to do is use the system
to your advantage.

In that spirit, allow me to present my
“Guide to Becoming Famous in the Late
1990s.” It’s easy, once you have the hang
of it!

Your ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd some way into
the entertainment industry. You don’t need
talent, just a willingness to show off your
private parts, a somewhat surly demeanor
and “connections.” Of all of these, con-

 

nections are the hardest to come by and are
the only thing you can’t fake. It’s a daunt-
ing task, but don’t lose hope, because
everybody loves the spunky underdog.

Once you’ve gotten yourself into the
entertainment indusuy, you’ll need to
learn to piss people off. Start simply, with
the Christian right. All you have to do is be
anti-everything, regardless of whether
you’re contradicting yourself. Then move
slowly to Middle
America, the type of
people who really
don’t have an opin-
ion on anything but
can get pissed off if
provided with the
right stimulus. Once
you’ve managed to
piss them off, you’ll
need to move on to
the liberals. To piss
them off, you’ll have
to to abuse your right
to free speech to
such an extent that
people actually begin to question that
right. Trust me, nothing makes liberal
blood boil more than that.

After you’ve managed to get every-
one’s collective panties in a bunch, you’ll
need a gimmick It has to be something no
one’s ever seen before, so pseudo-
satanism and the willingness to set your-
self aﬂame are out of the question. Ditto
for hypersexuality, watered-down femi-
nism (aka “Girl Power”) and cult-like fol-
lowings. Get creative! There has to be
something the American public hasn’t

seen yet.

As for myself, I’m particularly enam-
ored by the concept of fame based on
doing absolutely nothing. I’ll release a CD
containing 70 minutes of completely noth-
ing, but it will have an excessively
provocative title (deﬁnitely containing the
“F” word). To promote the album, I’ll do
interviews with the press during which I’ll
refuse to answer any questions about the
album itself but will be more than happy to
discuss politics. I’ll charge $40 a ticket to
see me in concert, and I ’ll never even take
the stage! My public appearances will be
marked by screaming matches with the
press and public, and assorted criminal
mischief. The whole world will hate me,
and at the same time they’ll be so
engrossed by my antics that I’ll be cashing
in big time!

There is, however, a catch. You can’t
let the public know you’re a part of the
system. It’s the kiss of death. You have to
rage against the system and convince peo-
ple that it’s compromising your artistic
integrity and suﬁocating you as a person.
You need people to believe that you are
truly some sort of martyr, even though
your martyrdom has brought you millions
of dollars. Sure it’s a lie, but the public is
too stupid to notice. And please, don’t let a
little thing like personal integrity or moral-
ity get in between you and fame!

Mark Campbell is busy recording that
album as you read this. He plans on
releasing “@#!.’& You All! ” independent-
ly, as the record companies will only stiﬂe
his creativity.

Sexual assault education needs to be targeted to more men

Elizabeth

Bowen

I’m guessing that the recent acquit-
tal of accused rapist Todd David DeCato
has sparked many debates and incited
many hot tempers across the University
of Pittsburgh campus. I’m not going to
voice my opinion on that affair, since
the trial isn’t even over and it’s hard to
come to any real conclusions about an
event so lacking in hard evidence. What
I’m angry about is the simple fact that
rapes do occur frequently at Pitt and the
approach Pitt has toward stopping them.

At Pitt, as well as at hundreds of
other college campuses across the coun-
try, rape is a serious problem. To my
knowledge, Pitt has gone about combat-
ing rape in the traditional way: by talk-
ing to the potential victims, aka the
female students. The Sexual Assault
Services’ program on the prevention of
rape and sexual assault, held at the
beginning of this term, took place at the
all—female Holland Hall, an indication
that it was targeted toward an audience

of women.

This approach does make a lot of
sense. As victims rather than offenders
in the vast majority of all rapes, it is
important for women to be educated and
aware of how to preserve their personal
safety. Knowledge of self-defense, as
well as knowing how to avoid getting
into dangerous situations in the first
place, is critical for all women — col-
lege women in particular.

But rapes don’t occur because of
anything women are doing. By deﬁni-
tion, a rape is when a man forces a
woman to have intercourse without her
consent. Translation: A rape is the result
of a man’s actions, except in a few rare
reverse cases. In general, if you want to
solve a problem, you ﬁgure out what’s
causing it and try to change the cause so
that the problem doesn’t occur anymore.

So when it comes to rape preven-
tion, why are we always targeting
women instead of men?

Perhaps some would argue rape
awareness programs aimed toward men
would be unsuccessful, because “boys

will be boys,” and no amount of educa-
tion can prevent rapes from occurring.
The best we can do is teach women how
to avoid, as best they can, an act that
some men are bound to commit. This
simply isn’t true.

The rape awareness programs we
have instruct female audiences to repeat
the mantra no means no, your body is
your own, and it is your prerogative to
protect it. Males need to be educated in
a similar matter.They too need to real-
ize no really does .mean no, and they
need to know what consequences they
will face if they rape a woman. They
need to recognize the fact that by com-
mitting rape they are destroying some-
one else’s life —— that rape isn’t some-
thing a girl can get over in a day or two,
or shake off like a bad dream. They need
to be aware of the legal and social reper-
cussions that will await them if they are
convicted of committing this crime.

It’s hard to say that, in the heat of
the moment, what a man learned in a
rape awareness program would be the
only thing that would prevent him from

raping a woman. But it really could
make a difference. If we could get the
message across to every male on Pitt’s
campus that rape is wrong, that rape is a
serious crime, that rape destroys lives,
then hopefully at least some of the
males here would realize the severity of
this crime, and learn to respect women
and think before they act.

By targeting only the female student
body, we are implying that rape is only
a woman’s issue, something that women
should handle on their own. This myth
needs to be dispelled.

Rape isn’t a female thing. It’s not a
feminist thing, either, or a student thing,
or a heterosexual thing. Rape is a seri-
ous problem and one that requires uni-
versal cooperation to alleviate.
Commuters and residents, young and
old, gay and straight, male and female:
We need to work together on this one.

Elizabeth Bowen believes that potential
assailants as well as potential victims
need to be taught about rape preven-
tion.

    

UConn looks a lot

like UMass game of
1996, so be there

Quick trivia question: What's the
capacity of Fitzgerald Field House?

According to any official infor-
mation you’ll ﬁnd, the ﬁeld house
holds 6,798 basketball fans. Anyone
who was there the night of Jan. 23,
1996, knows better.

The official attendance of that
night’s basketball game was a sellout
crowd of 6,798, but the actual number
of people there was certainly a few
thousand more.

What was the big attraction? It
wasn’t the Panthers, who entered the
game with a mediocre 8-5 record and
were coming off of consecutive loss-
es to Rutgers and Miami.

Most of the crowd came to see the
Panthers’ opponents that night, the
undefeated University of
Massachusetts Minutemen. UMass
was the nation’s top-ranked team at
the time. Its best player, center
Marcus Camby, led the Minutemen to
the ﬁnal four that year and was the
second pick in that summer's NBA
draft. .

Camby was injured and didn’t
play in that game against Pitt, which
probably was part of the reason the
Panthers had a chance to beat the
nation’s top team. But with or without
the star player, the game was still akin
to David battling Goliath.

Everyone in the building knew
that. Pitt led by five at halftime, and
the longer Pitt went without getting
blown out, the more excited the
crowd got. It was a lot like last year’s
football game against Miami, before
John Jenkins intercepted the final
pass of the game to seal the Pitt vic-
tory.

With the score tied and just sec-
onds left, Pitt’s Andre Alridge put up
a desperate last shot that bounced off
the rim, sending the game into over-
time. UMass dominated the overtime
period to win the game 79-71.

This Saturday at noon, the
Panthers have a chance to recreate
that atmosphere when the number-
one ranked Connecticut Huskies visit
the field house. The star for the
Huskies is Richard Hamilton. Most
experts think Hamilton is the best
player in the country, just like they
thought about Camby a few years
ago.

Bowl

Ross Destmone
Staff Writer

It’s the most wonderful time of the
year for college football fans — time for
the Bowl games.

This year marks the first year of the
Bowl Championship Series. The BCS
uses a complex formula done by a com-
puter to determine the best teams in col-
lege football.

Some of the factors in the formula
are wins and losses, strength of schedule,
and average ranking in the college foot-
ball polls. .

This system was installed this year
in order to avoid some of the past prob-
lems with the Associated Press Top 25

and the ESPN/ USA Today coaches’ poll
deciding the national champion.

It’s arranged so that the top two
teams in the BCS can play against each
other for the national championship. The
championship game is rotated between
four different bowl games.

This year, the championship game
will be the Fiesta Bowl, followed by the
Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl and the Rose
Bowl, ensuring that there will be no
shared championship.

The two teams facing off in the
championship game are Tennessee and
Florida State. Tennessee was one of the
top—three undefeated teams heading into
Saturday and the only one that survived.

Florida State was pushed up to num-
__ ber two in the BCS
:1. after a wild
A" Saturday during
»  which UCLA and
" Kansas State were
upset.

UCLA’s loss
 came at the hands
of Miami, 49-45, in
_ a shootout. Then
Kansas State was
stunned in double-
overtime by Texas
A&M, 36-33. The
win got Texas
A&M into the
Sugar Bowl against
Ohio State.

Kansas State
was left out of all
of the BCS games

although they still
finished third in the

picture clears for many teams

BCS rankings.

The Orange Bowl will feature
Florida against Syracuse, then the Rose
Bowl will round out the BCS games with
Wisconsin against UCLA.

Here’s a list of the Bowls and
matchups.

 : Tennessee vs. Florida State

This is the game that will decide
once and for all who’s the best team in
the country. Both of these teams feature
strong defenses and reasonably power
offenses. Don’t expect either of them to
be spending a lot of time in the end zone.

 : Florida vs. Syracuse

Its pretty interesting to see that both
of the teams in the Orange Bowl are
orange. If the quarterbacks get confused,
things could get interesting.

 : Ohio State vs. Texas A&M

It looks like it’s going to be another
year without a national championship for
the Buckeyes, but they still have a
chance to earn some respect. Don’t
expect any from Texas A&M. The team
would love to turn Ohio State into its
next upset victims.

 : UCLA vs. lVsconsin

UCLA features one of the most
potent offenses in college football, led by
one of the most dangerous quarterbacks
(Cade McNown). The tearn’s defense is
quite the opposite.

They’ve had tremendous problems
making tackles, and their problems will
probably get worse with Ron Dayne

Wrestlers roll the dice in |.as Vegas but come back empty

Brlan Knavtsh

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team competed
in the Las Vegas Invitational this week-
end, a tournament so competitive that
head coach Rande Stottlemyer called it
“a rriini-nationals.”

“That's why we go out there,” said
Stottlemyer, “it’s the biggest touma-
ment [other than nationals].”

The Panthers, who were without
the services of their best wrestler, All-
American Nick Mengerink, finished a
disappointing 28th of 43 teams.

“That was the first time since 1993
that we didn’t have a guy place [in the
top eight],” Stottlemyer said.
“Obviously, [Mengerink] not being

there hurt us, but I thought Chad
[Jekso] and [Mike] Ziska would
place.”

Despite no one placing,
Stottlemyer was impressed by the per-
formances of some of his wrestlers.

He felt Jesko, the 149-pounder,
wrestled well Friday but had a bad
Saturday morning, which probably
kept him from placing.

Stottlemyer was also quite
impressed with true freshman Dan
Stine, who wrestled well against the
country’s third- and fourth-ranked
grapplers at the 197-pound weight
class.

The wrestling team's attention now
turns to the dual-meet season, which
opens Thursday when Pitt takes on fel-

low Eastern Wrestling League foe
Bloomsburg at Fitzgerald Field House.

Bloomsburg has been near the bot-
tom of the EWL the last few years, but
according to Stottlemyer, the Huskies
are a much stronger team this year.

“They’ve improved a lot,”
Stottlemyer said. “They've recruited
really well, and they've redshirted a lot
of guys. They’re a good team this year,
and next year they’ll be even better.”

Stottlemyer said his team will have
to wrestle well at every weight class to
beat Bloomsburg and the other teams
on the schedule.

“We will not have an easy dual
meet this season,” he said.

The match begins at 7:30 p.m. and
will be broadcast on WPTS 92.1 FM.

When three collegiate wrestlers
died of extreme dehydration from cut-
ting weight last season, the nation
cried out to the NCAA, “Something
needs to be done to stop unsafe
weight-cutting.”

The NCAA listened. An entire new
set of rules designed to eliminate
unsafe weight-cutting — the practice
of sweating to lose weight and reach a
desired weight class — has been put
into place for the 1998-99 wrestling
season.

So what do wrestlers think of the 

new, safer rules designed to keep the
alive?

Rob Loper. “I think they’re more
restraining to the athletes. Now ﬁve

have to constantly be watching  fihat plastic w
weight and dieting, and that gékes  abolished. ‘

away from our college experiencei.”
Under the old rules, a wrest , stil;

the mat at 133.

Another interesting rule change for
this wrestling season is the order of the
matches

Traditionally, dual meets start with
the lightweights and go in order of
weight class, always finishing with the
heavyweights.

This year, the weight class to wres-
tle the first match will be randomly
picked, then matches will continue to
go up according to weight class. After
the heavyweight wrestles, it will drop
back down to the lightest weight class
and continue until all 10 classes have
wrestled.

For example, if the weight class
chosen to go first is.184, the following
match will be 197, then heavyweight,
then it will drop to to 125, and so on.

This dramatically changes
wrestlers’ mental preparations. A
heavyweight used to always wrestle
last, a slot that also carries the most
pressure should a dual meet come

enough to curb some of the ' 

“In the past, the heavyweight was
always last, and that had some advan-

weights’ mental preparation time. “But
heavyweights also had some disadvan-

match always comes down to you.
This will be the great equalizer.”

Mississippi State’s defense is good,
but can it stop Ricky Wﬂharns, who hap-

nation?

Michigan started the season disap-

 : Notre Dame vs. Georgia

As long as Notre Dame doesn't have

Penn State’s defense has played
pretty well this season, but they’ll have
to do even better to stop Kentucky quar-

COLUMN

ketball, this is one of those events
with the potential to be more than just
a basketball game. You didn’t need to
know anything about basketball to
enjoy the UMass game in 1996. You
didn’t need to know anything about
football to help tear down the goal-
posts after the Miami game. You don’t
need to be a basketball fan to be part
of the electric atmosphere when your
school plays the nation’s best team.
Of course, if you are a basketball
fan, this game could also be a good
match between two strong teams.
Unlike the 1996 UMass game, Pitt has
an above—average team this time,
although that may not be obvious
after the Panthers’ last few perfor-

mances.

Pitt’s main trouble of late has
been extraordinarily poor shooting.
That will change. Any team that
works as hard in the paint as the
Panthers do (as evidenced by their
rebounding statistics, especially on
the offensive boards) is bound to
shoot better than 31 percent from the
floor, as Pitt did at Tennessee. They
are also almost guaranteed to get to
the free throw line more than seven
times in a game, another factor in
Pitt’s most recent loss.

Pitt will put on a good show on
Saturday. So go and enjoy the game.
But get there early. Rumor has it that
there are only 6,798 seats available.

Alamo Bowl: Purdue vs. Kansas State
K-State’s still fuming after an upset
loss to Texas A&M and being dropped
out of all of the BCS games. Purdue’s
defense may not be able to contain K-
State’s quarterback Michael Bishop.

Music gig Bowl: Virginia Tech vs.
Alabama

Alabama better be well—prepared for
Virginia Tech’s rushing attack.

Micron PC Bowl: North Carolina State
vs. Miami

N.C. State’s a pretty good team, but
Miarni’s still going to be fired up after its
upset of UCLA.

Insiﬂtcom Bowl: West Virginia vs.

Missouri

Here’s a pair of teams that have
played strong schedules and played
them well.

Oahu Bowl: Air Force vs. Washington

Air Force has played the best
defense in the Western Athletic
Conference this season. Washington has
not.

Aloha Bowl: Colorado vs. Oregon

Both teams have had better seasons
in the past, but it should still be a good
matchup.

Motor City Bowl: Marshall vs.
Louisville
Apparently, Marshall’s done OK

without Randy Moss.

Las Vegas Bowl: San Diego State vs.
North Carolina

This looks like it could be another
one of those shootouts.

It looks there’s going to be a great
finish to the College football season.
