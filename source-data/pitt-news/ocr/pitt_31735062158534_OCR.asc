e Separate But Equal a
One of the aspects of Pitt student life in need‘ of-major
 jrevamping is the religious program-

p Chaplain Luccok must realize the inherent weakness
of calling the services in Heinz Chapel, “Campus Chapel

Services.” This billing is simply inappropriate.

The services are Presbyterian and thus fulﬁll at deﬁnite

,role on campus. This role, however, is not as the Campus

students: .
I The Pitt~News is making a change beginning today in
the listing of religious services. We plan to list the services
of the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths in one box,
entitled Chapel Services. R ‘ r P
 Thus ‘the three major faiths will be represented to-
gether on an equal basis.
- It is too bad that we cannot have ,“Campus Chapel
Services.” But many Jewish students and ‘the Cathglic .Dio-
cese find the Heinz Chapel objectionable as a place of wor-

Chapel but merely one of the‘ campus services availableto

‘ ship. .

 In ‘order to have services‘ of all faiths on the campus,
a new chapel is necessary. This should be strongly consid-
ered by the Board! of Religion and other groups concerned.
.It might be conservative in decor, representatives of

e the three faiths participating in the planning._ A rotary altar

might be installed to permit the new ediﬁce to be called the

/

_ Eventually‘ this should be done. The sooner, the better,
This would once and’ for all alleviate the unrealistic re-
ligious picture on campus. ‘ ‘ V ‘ ‘

Heinz Chapel, as a place of esthetic magniﬁcence, will_

continue to be a credit” to the University. ‘ '
It could be used as a meeting place for the Religious

_ ','Choir which might perform in the new chapel. or Heinz
' _Chapel depending on the occasion. ‘ '

It might be used for programs of visiting groups before

’  the student body or friends of the University, similar_to
that of the University of Muenster madrigal- choir which

appeared last fall. - 6

C E In these ways, the Chapel might still .be‘ effectively

' utilized in the University scheme, while the religious groups
on campus would be satisﬁed with their facilities.

SAIL oN, SAIL oN: .

I suppose October 12 is just another day to you. You get up in
the ordinary Wayland do all the ordinary things yog ordinarily
do. You have your breakfast, you walk your ocelotl, you go to
classes, you write home for money, you burn the dean in effigy,
you watch Disneyland, and you go to bed. And do you give one
little thought to the fact that«October 12 is Columbus Day?
No, you do not._

‘Nobody tl1inl<s about Columbus these days. Let us, there-
fore, pause I or a moment and retell his ever-glorious, endlessly
stirring saga.

Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451.

_ ‘His father, Ralph T. "Columbus, was in the three—Ininut-e auto

Wash game. ». His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a

' splinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four

brothers and eightsisters. With his father busy all day at the
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,
young Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.
However, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader
and spent all his Waking hours immersed in a book. Unfor-
tunately, there was only one book‘ in Genoa at the time——-
Care of the Horse by Aristotle—a.nd after several years of reading
Care of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor
reached him that there was another book in Barcelona," off he
ran as fast as his fat little legs wouldcarry him.

The rumor, alas, proved false. Theonly book in Barcelona
was Cuidar urn Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing
more than a Spanish translation of Care; of the Horse. .

Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going to I

India where, according to legend, there were thousands of books.
But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and after so
many years of reading Care of the H orsc, Columbus never wanted
to clap eyes on a‘ horse again. Then a new thought struck hiu1:
perhaps it was possiblextoget to India by sea!

Fired with his revolutionary -new idea, Columbus raced to A

the‘ court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs" (Co-_
lumbus was plagued with little fat legs all his life) and pleaded?
his case with such fervor that the rulers were persuaded. '

On October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World.

“The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders
~ never before seen in Europe-spices and metals and plants and ’

ﬂowers and—most wondrous of a1l—tobacco! Qh, what a sensa-

tion tobacco caused in Europe! The ﬁlter had long since been

invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew __
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer, made

still another great discovery: he took a ﬁlter, put tobacco in

front of it, and invented the world’s ﬁrst ﬁlter cigarette! I

Through the centuries ﬁlters have been steadily improved
_ and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate

"ip the ﬁlter cigarette—Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece

of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great ﬁlter, great smoke!
And so, good friends, when next you enjoy a’ ﬁne Marlboro
Cigarette, give a. thought to the plucky Genoese, Christopher
Columbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole lovely

thing possible. _ _ I V .
