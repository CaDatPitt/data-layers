Arson Suspected In Lothrop Blaze

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Separate investigations of arson
in connection with an elevator ﬁre
Wednesday night at the Lothrop
Street Residence are being con-
ducted by Pitt Police and the city
Fire Prevention Department.

Firemen extinguished a blazing
laundry hamper ﬁlled with linen
and towels in the ground ﬂoor
elevator. None of the estimated
450 dorm occupants suffered
injury.

Lothrop Street Residence Area
Coordinator Debbie Warden pulled
the alarm at 10:34 p.m. When she
discovered the elevator settled on
the ground ﬂoor aﬂame. The

False Fire
Alarms Are
Dirty Pool

- “We should have a program at
Pitt to look out for people who pull .
false fire alarms and hang them by
the nearest pole,” Pitt Fire
Marshall Gene Barry said yester-
day. - .

Barry acknowledged many stu-
dents hesitated to leave the
Lothrop Street Residence when the
alarm was sounded Wednesday
might because they thoughtit was
false.

Last year when Amos Hall was
on fire one girl heard the alarm and
rolled over and went back to sleep,
Barry said.

‘ Students should never question
the pertinence of a ﬁre alarm,
Barry said. “Just get your tail out
of there.”

burning elevator had opened on
ﬂoors four, eight and eleven on a
trip upward from the basement.

Off duty ﬁreman and former Pitt
policeman Donald Dorsey, who was
visiting a friend in the dorm when
the ﬁre occured, threw a dry
powder chemical in the elevator to
control the ﬂames.

Three ﬁre departments respond-
ed full force to the one-alarm ﬁre.
Three engine pumpers, an elevator
platform, a rescue unit from Mercy
Hospital, an aerial truck and the
battalion chief car arrived at the
scene within minutes.

Firemen quickly extinguished
the ﬂames and ventilated all ﬂoors.
The ﬁre chief deemed re-entry safe
one hour after the alarm sounded.
Fire Chief Harris commended
the occupants’ orderly evacuation.

Although the general evacuation
proceeded smoothly, Resident As-
sistant Ginny Johnson said many
residents left their doors wide open
or unlocked when they rushed

, down the stairwell.

Most people thought a prankster
pulled the alarm and, therefore,
hesitated before evacuating.

Fortunately, this laundry cart was the only damage caused by a
one-alarm blaze at Pitt’s Lothrop Street Residence Wednesday night.

Johnson said no one on the eight
ﬂoor realized the elevator was on
ﬁre until the alarm sounded and
residents opened their doors to see
smoke seeping through the wing
doorways.

One student grabbed a ﬁre
extinguisher and entered the
smoke-filled elevator reception
area on the ﬂoor, but no ﬂames
were visible.

With the exception of a few shrill
screams and snifﬂes, most of the
occupants proceeded calmly out the
main exit on Lothrop Street.

While the crowd waited anxious-
ly, a light drizzle fell, dampening a
few dorm rugs because most of the
hundreds of windows were left
open.

SGB Votes
To Lobby:
Marijuana

BY TOM WASELESKI

The decriminalization of mari-
juana possession in Pennsylvania
will be sought by the Student
Government Board (SGB) in
cooperation with students from
other local campuses, the Board
voted Wednesday night.

The SGB passed a motion to
support the Citizens Education
Action Group (CEAG) in organizing
a student from for effective
legislation to decriminalize cases of
possession involving ‘small
amounts. '

SGB President Barry Weisband
said later that passage of the
motion indicated Board support for
the decriminalization of marijuana.

There’s a lot of injustice, not only
in Pennsylvania, Hut also in the
United States, concerning the issue
of the marijuana,” he said, adding

he personally favors its decrim_ina- -

tion.

The marijuana question was put’,
to the Board by Annette Kolski of
CEAG and Ellen Doyle of the
American Civil Liberties Union.

Neighbors UpsetOver Fraternity Rush

The complaint was reportedly

Mine Workers Endorse

Heinz For Senate

BY MREA CSORBA

The Pennsylvania United Mine
Workers (UMW) announced yes-
terday their support of U.S. Senate
hopeful H._John Heinz 111 over his
opponent U.S. Representative Wil-
liam J. Green.

The endorsement came after a
vote was taken by the National
Council of the Coal Miners Political
Action Committee (COMPAC), a
group selected by the UMW to
represent them in the political
arena.

The mine workers’ statement
came just prior to a luncheon
debate between Heinz and green
before the Pittsburgh Chapter of
the Life Underwriters Association
at the Hilton Hotel.

The debate went smoothly with
no major disputes between the two
candidates, despite the distributing
of COMPAC pro-Heinz leaﬂets
passed out before the meeting.

Both blamed inflation for the
insufﬁcient allowances received by
Social Security recipiants, both
agreed that public service jobs are
needed to stimulate the economy
(naming railroad and bridge repair
as the obvious starting point in
Pennsylvania) and both were in
favor of a national health plan.

Heinz stressed the importance of
creating permanent public service
jobs to help curb unemployment.
“We do not need ‘make-work’jobs,
but those that will introduce

Tau,and Kappa Sigma fraternities
on the 4700 block of Bayard.

Residents of the neighborhood
have accused the fraternities of
excessive noise at their rush parties
last weekend. Other complaints
include blocked driveways, verbal
assault and urinating in public.

Jay McNamara, president of the
lnterfratemity Council (IFC) said,
however, that the rush parties last
weekend were quiet and no
incidents were reported.

McNamara said a city police
ofﬁcer, hired by the IFC, was
present both nights to move rush
participants along. after the parties
and to watch for incidents during
the parties.

Phil Rosenthal, a member of
Zeta Beta Tau, said the Dartv at his
fraternity was “very, very tame.”

“We have made practically
every attempt possible to get along
with the neighbors,” Rosenthal
said. “We had two brothers on the
front porch of our house at all
times, and nothing,’ happened
outside.”

Rosenthal said he felt some of

the neighbors were unwilling to _

compromise. and were only trying
to force the fraternities to move
from the area. ‘

“People have been known to
block driveways, and it will get
noisy at times, but I think these
people are getting carried away,”
Rosenthal said.

Neighborhood residents who
were contacted refused to comment
on the -problems, saying they will

pursue the matter through legal
channels and do not want publicity.

One woman in the neighborhood,
who asked not to be identified, said
this past weekend’s rush parties
were as bad as she has ever seen.

“I’ve been here for four years,
and these were not tame,” she
said. “It was abominable.”

She accused the fraternity
members of blasting stereo music
out of windows, urinating on her
lawn, blocking driveways in the
neighborhood and calling her

obscene names when she com-
plained.

‘ ‘You wouldn’t believe the noise.
They don’t care what they do,” she
said.

The fraternities tried to alleviate
past problems this year by hiring
the city policeman, requiring
special cards for admission to rush
parties and ending the parties at
12:30 a.m., according to McNam-
ara.

“It was as quiet on the street as
l’ve seen it in two years,” he said.

North Oakland Residents in the Bayard Street area reportedly filed

charges against two fraternities for

Saturday 'night’s rush parties.

CITY POLICE SHOULD PATROL
PARK, CLAIMS
SUPERINTENDENT

PITTSBURGH (AP)-—Pitts-
burgh police Supt. Robert Coll says
city police should take over
patroling Point State Park.

Coll said that a private security
guard was under the inﬂuence of
alcohol the night a city policeman
acting as a decoy was shot in the
park.

He said the private guards lack
the training and equipment to
control what he called “undesir-
able elements” in the area.

The park is currently patrolled by
a private company hired by the
state. Coll says the city’s
assistance has not been officially
requested. but if it is, he says he
will use the force's K-9 corps.

“I would like to see a railroad

On the national health issue,
Heinz said he favors a health
program not maintained by the
federal government that would
beneﬁt everyone. He suggested
implementation of a program
similar to the Hospital Mainten-
ance Plan, a private policy that
covers eye and dental care,’ in

addition to doctor and hospitaliza-

Green reserved statement on
whether the program should be
federally run. ~ ,

The debate was low-keyed with
only a few verbal assaults that,

this campaign.

Tyner Blasts Ford, Carter

There is no essential difference
between a Gerald Ford and a
Jimmy Carter, according to Com-
munist -Party vice presidential
candidate Jarvis Tyner, and that is
why many Americans don’t vote.

Tyner, a native of west Philadel-
phia, is running with Communist
Party presidential candidate Gus
Hall. Their names will appear on
the ballot in about 15 states,
including Pennsylvania.

“We really don’t have any
choices on the vital issues,” Tyner
said in a press conference
Wednesday. “Both candidates are
for an austere economy. They only
differ on how to handle
austerity. Neither are really for
government-provided jobs, and

SGB Lobbies for Marijuana

(Continued from Page 1)

“The Pennsylvania legislature
feels it's not pressured by young
people at all,” Doyle said. “I
testiﬁed at last year’s hearings
where an old legislator waved a
Reader’s Digest article as his
source material."

Kolski said state legislators are
up for re-election this November,
and it is a good time for student
voters to force their representatives

‘to take a stand on the issue.

She said the CEAG is enlisting
the support of local campuses for
new marijuana legislation in
Harrisburg. The CEAG has
already contacted Chatham College
and Camegie-Mellon University.

“It’s a good rallying subject,”
Weisband said. “I would like to
see the Board take it up in
conjunction with the Legal Aware-
ness Committee.” ’

In a programming committee
report to SGB, Chairman Bill

Lureye reported problems with the 1

handling of a Black Week concert,
scheduled for November. ,

During spring term, the Board
had approved a recommendation
which gave the programming
committee responsibility for the
production of a Black Week
Concert in cooperation with the
Black Action Society (BAS).

At that time BAS and members
of the programming committee
were opposed to the Board’s
recommendation.

Lureye said planning the concert
is difficult because BAS; and
programming don’t know their
specific responsibilities.

Lureye requested written guide-
lines from the Board to outline each
group's responsibility regarding
the concert.

Weisband quoted from alloca-
tions committee guidelines. “The
choice of the band is up to the Black
Action. Society and the show is to be
produced by the concert commit-
tee.” Those concerned could infer

from the guidelines that the concert
committee was responsible for all
phases of « production, including
contracting the band, he said.

“The only responsibility BAS
has,” Weisband said, “is selecting
the group it wants."

In other business, the Board
rejected fears voiced by the South
Oakland Citizen's Council and
voted to send a letter of support of
support to “Chances R” supper
club owner Ernest Smallis.

Chances R is embroiled in a
neighborhood controversy over its
transition from Wohlfarth’s Pub to
a supper club. Smallis is seeking
an extension of the bar’s liquor
license which expires in 1977, but
local citizen groups want the state
Liquor Control Board to conduct a
hearing before granting a renewal.

Board member Chip Hubbard
reported Smallis has made several
concessions to concerned Oakland

ﬁresidents.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
PLOT INVESTIGATED

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP)-
A court psychiatrist said Tuesday
that two men accused of plotting to
assassinate Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy are competent to stand
trial. ’

A woman charged with the pair
in the alleged conspiracy to murder
the younger brother of slain
President John F. Kennedy and the
late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was
not examined.

Robert E. White, 42, identified
by police as the organizer of the
alleged plot; David J. King, 31, or
Springﬁeld, and Sandra Rondeau,
37, of Westfield have all entered
innocent pleas to the conspiracy
charges against them.

The trio was arrested after King

neither say much about eliminating
racism.”

Tyner said he is not satisfied
with Democrat Jimmy Carter’s
promise to appoint more blacks to
government posts. “Black faces in
high places is not the answer. It
only helps only 5% of the blacks.”

Tyner said the low turnout at
election time can be attributed to a
lack of choice. “The Communist
Party's presence on the ballot
enhances the possibility of more
people voting,” he said.

He said he received a much
better reception from voters this
year, and volunteers collecting

signatures required to put the party .

on the ballot met less opposition.
“Most people were killing to sign,
and some who weren’t said it was
only because they‘were afraid of
harassment.”

Tyner complained that fewer
black students were in college this
year than two years ago.
“Cutbacks in education are making

wealthy,” he said. '

1 persuade the state legislature to change Pem1sylvania’s outdated

We support this attempt by the SGB to get involved in the political
issues that affect the Pitt student population. Perhaps a coalition of
studentgovernments from all over the state can ﬁnally make a dent on
a state legislature that has so far considered the student vote
unimportant. Unlike the recent unsuccessful battle with the tight-wad
legislature for more state aid for education, the student groups might
stand a chance of winning this one. Decriminalizing pot7doesn’t cost

money.

It has long been proven that marijuana has no serious side
effects—certainly none more serious than those encountered from
alcohol. To prohibit marijuana because it endangers public health is
basing a law on outdated medical knowledge.

There can be no beneﬁt for either the state government or the
Commonwealth’s populace in maintaining a law that is widely ignored,
notuniformly enforced and is far too strict. The state’s marijuana law
makes many students attending college in Pennsylvania criminals.

The truth is, the question of decriminalizing marijuana has long
stopped being a topic for objective discussion and has become a
statutory line of defense where the state’s conservative, agriculturally ,
‘dominated legislature will make a stand against‘ the student rabble
coming from the cities. Ifthe drug laws are going to be changed, then
there had better be an active coalition working for it.

looking at the present SGB’s dismal record when it comes to .

a working in coalitions, we hope that theydo more than pay lip service to‘
‘ a good idea. Many of the tactics used last year in ﬁghting the tuition

hike could be used in ﬁghting for the ‘decriminalization of marijuana.
Local legislatures should be asked where they stand on the issue. Ifthe
state legislature receives a petition with the names of several thousand
Pitt students on it, they might begin to look twice at the
issue—-especially if other colleges and universities follow suit.

We support the decriminalization of marijuana and feel that the SGB
is moving in the right direction. We hope they will actively work for the
repeal of the state’s drug laws and are not, as they have done too many
times in the past, just blowing smoke- A

” Standing in Line

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Standing in line is one of the
great social events of the academic
year" at the University.

.By it’s very nature, it forces

people to talk to each other, touch
each other and in a lot of'ways
takes V the place of the first
ice-breaker for many of us.
There is a shared experience of
pain, frustration, inner doubt and
self-analysis comparable only to
that shared by football players and
thos first few Christian martyrs.
V For the ﬁrst few weeks at least,
standing in line forms an important

A Sad Irony

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

Perhaps the least understand-
able and senseless of crime that
occurs on the Pitt campus is
vandalism.

The crime is committed not for
any gain but rather to gratify some
perverted desire to destroy others
property. While those who
vandalize property may get their
jollies seeing glass break or plaster
crack, it is anything but amusing to
those who have to clean up after
them and pay for the damages.

Which brings us to the reason
vandalism is senseless when
considered in contextito the Pitt
campus: Unlike other crimes,
which are usually committed by
outsiders, vandalism is committed
by Pitt students against Pitt
students. In the end, however,
everybody, indluding the vandals,
will have to pay for the damage in
the form of higher tuition and dorm
costs. ’

There are times when the cost of
vandalism can’t be measured in
dollars. Such a time came
Wednesday night when a ﬁre broke
out in aLothrop Street Residence
elevator, where a hamper full of
rags had been set aflame. On
selected floors, the elevator doors
opened and as smoke appeared on
several different floors, the‘imme-
diate conclusionlof the residents
was that the whole building was on
ﬁre. ’

All of this was complicated by
the fact that the residents of
University buildings are used to
hearing ﬁre bells going off because
of constant false alarms and were
slow in responding--that is, until
they saw the smoke, in which case
a few became hysterie3l.l

There is a certain macabre
humor to this. It’s the kind of
prank most Pitt students grew up
watching on television sit-coms.

C°nt1'3TY t0 the papersstudiers,
the desperate types undergo a thrill
of sheer terror when a student in

must begin the line again. They see
themselves in a similar situation,

When someone screamed “Fire!”
all kind of funny things happened.

What happened Wednesday
night wasn’t funny. It was a

criminal act that could have had

tragic results.

Since the University’s security

systems are designed only to
prevent unauthorized people from
entering buildings, they do little to
prevent vandalism since the
vandals have all the proper I.‘D..

In many cases, the act of
vandalism is seen by other students
but goes unreported. Last Sunday,
a group f male students broke
through the security doors on one
of Tower C’s ﬂoors for women and
rampaged up and down the halls,
Several of the ’
floor’s residents complained to the
PITT NEWS about the incident and
claimed they "could identify the

banging on doors.

persons involved. None of them,
however, are willing to go to the
campus police in fear of reprisal.

It is a sad irony the the notorious
Oakland streets might become a

safer place to walk than the
hallways of the University’s dormi—
tories.

Again . . . Why
Fraternities

WHY FRATERNITIES:

This letter is in response to Jay
McNamara’s dissertation on fra-
ternities. I would also like to ask
why fraternities? First I would like
to know which fraternity handbook
he copied this creed out of. It
certainly wasn’t one at Pitt. Jay’s
letter made it sound more like he
was writing about the Salvation
Army than a fraternity at Pitt.

Jay explained that a community ’

‘proﬁts from being near a fraternity.

I believe that too. It gives the
neighborhood a chance to sense
what an earthquake is like,
especially during a party where a
band is playing. The community

.‘.?‘.:°+9_‘??‘3e‘f1*,S. from all. the garbage. . ,
around the fraternity house after a

"\

rush party. It makes it easier for
the streetcleaner to know where to
clean ﬁrst the next day.

Jay says the fraternity constitute
the polish that a man desires in his
late adolelescent years. I believe
that too. At fraternities they polish
something off all right and they
also gain something for their later
years, it forms right over their
belts.

To me it seems the fraternity has
one purpose, to keep that tap
flowing. To fulﬁll this goal the
fraternity must keep getting new
members, kind of like a chain
letter. As long as the beer ﬂows
the “brothers” are happy.

I wouldn't be getting down on
fraternities unless they affected
me. They do, so I am. Our track
team at Pitt has lost some ﬁne
athletes to the fraternity life and
then to the bottle. It is -a real
shame. Why fraternities? We
don't need them!

Wilamowski, Dorsett
High School Mates

/Continued from Page 10)

successful three-year tenure at

“In hig school, both Tony and I Pitt

-were recruited by Notre Dame,”
Wilamowski reﬂected quietly.
“Back then I thought that was just
great since I had been hearing
about Notre Dame this and Notre
Dame that since I was a little kid.

“-I was all hepped up about their
offer until they sent me a letter
saying that I was too small for their
program,” Wilamowski said with a
slight trace of bitterness in his
voice.

Small in Notre Dame's opinion or
not, Wilamowski was more deter-
mined than ever to make it in
college ball as he proceeded to sift
through the other offers before he
once and for all decided upon Pitt.

According to the 6-3, 2-18-pound
end. Majors’ commitment to
winning football (“he installed a
successful program at Iowa State”)
and the coach's promise that he
would return around Pitt’s then
staggering football fortunes, were
major decisions in Wilamowski’s
decision to bring his gridiron wares
to the Oakland campus.

A little luck was involved, too,
concerning the Panthers’ situation
in recruiting Wilamowski. Heis-
man Trophy candidate Dorsett also
had an indirect hand in seeing that
“GentleiEd” would one day wear
the Pitt old gold and blue. It so
happened that when the Pitt
coaching staff was viewing Dorsett
in high school game ﬁlms, it too

noticed Wilamowski roaming the
ﬁeld with the same size, speed and
intelligence which have made him
an integral part of one of the finest
defensive lines in college football
today—this year’s Panther defen-
sive front wall. ,

“Tony and I sort of came in a
package deal,” Wilamowski said.
“In fact, we both signed on the
same day.” .

Without doubt, that spring day
in 1973 marked one of Majors’
greater recruiting scoops in his

Boaters Take

‘college game at home, was estatic ’

and credited his coach for the
current Panther success.

“I’m proud of it,” Roccon said of
his assist. “Coach Bemis deserved
credit. He has a lot of patience and
optimism. He works with us.”

The second half was a mirror of
the first. The Panthers had
countless chances to score, but
there was always something to get
in their way—a penalty, offsides
call, bad pass, diving Bearcat,
spaghetti strainer or other contri-
vance.

All in all, it was a great game.
The defense—Kim Blasko; Craig
Connolly, Murphy, Karl Nigh,
Irwin Siegel, Frank Bucci (an All
America goaltender candidate who
can fake the pants off everyone)
and company—-stole the ball from
St. Vincent offensemen with
unbelievable ease and kept the
Bearcats bottled up at mid-ﬁeld,
thus crediting themselves with a
shutout.

“A win is a win,” Bemis said
with a gleam in his eye. “This
team knows they can win.”

If they do, then Pitt’s opponents
this season had better ‘invest ina
good, solid dam. ‘

Pitt also offered him the chance
to play right off the bat. Although
hampered by what he terms
“nagging injuries" (the most
serious ailment being a torn
hamstring muscle), Wilamowski
has indeed been a stalwart on the
Panther defensive line since his
freshman days.

Perhaps for a good reason too.
Again reverting to last week’s
game, Wilamowski’s play at right
end was certainly a vital part in
right defensive tackle Randy
Holloway’s ability to garner defen-
sive player of the game honors at
South Bend last week. “Willy’s”
ability to contain the outside runs
forced the Irish to run inside-
generally smack in the, arms of
Holloway and Outland Trophy
candidate Al Romano.

There promises to be more good
days ahead for Wilamowski.

It's your serve...

Chinese Future ll11POl1Cle|'ClbleJudi¢iaIBaa;-dMember

  

BY MAGGIE MCKAY

China's political scene, following
the recent death of Mao Tse Tung
is a dark and murky one, claimed
John Paton Davies, a former China
Service officer in the State
Department, in a speech here last
night.

Davies, a casualty from the
McCarthy era, was ousted from the
State Department in 1951 after
undergoing eight loyalty-security
hearings. He refused to make any
predictions concerning China's
political future last night.

“I can only say that it is
impenetrable. It’s invisible to me
and I suspect is may be invisible to
the CIA," Davies said.

Mao’s goal of a permanent
revolutionary state, although
strongly affecting the Chinese
people, will,‘ according to Davies,
peeter out eventually.

"Mao's goal of a ' permanent
revolutionary state failed. The
change in the personality of the
Chinese people was tremendous,”

Davies said. “There’s no more

individuality. Selﬂessness, the
eternal smile are stressed. It's
almost like Reverend Moon. I may
be a terrible old cynic, but I don't
think it will last."

Mao was a man of diverse parts,
according to Davies", ‘a great
theoretician and poet.

Yet he was a man who was, in
the true sense of the word,
ruthless. Hitler sent people to the
gas chambers. Mao was inclined to
re-educate them."

Davies gave an overview of U.S.
involvement with China and
Indochina touching brieﬂy upon
Vietnam. The American govern-
ment had been badly burned once
by the “loss of China to Maoist
forces,” according to Davies, and
this loss made the U.S. terriﬁed of
losing Indochina to the commun-
ists.

“We all know the sad story of
Vietnam,” Davies said. “A great
deal of our problems came from our
overcommitment and not being
able to withdraw when we saw the
danger signs because of that

HARRISBURG (AP)—A con-

officials out of office would be a
good idea Gov. Shapp said
yesterday.

Despite his statement, Shapp
would not comment on a develop-

ballot, a decision which is expected
to be appealed by Rizzo.

A constitutional amendment to

Students seeking positions on
the campus and residence hall
judicial boards may submit applica-
tions now, Alden Bowen, coordina-

tor of the University student
judicial system, announced Wed-
nesday.

The campus judicial board
adjudicates all hearings stemming
from alleged violations of the
Student Code of Conduct. Those
alleged violations involving resi-
dence hall provisions of the code
are handled by the residence hall
judicial board.

The Code, established in 1972 by
the Board of Trustees, lists
nonacademic standards of student
behavior and applies to all
undergraduate, graduate and pro-
fessional students enrolled at Pitt.

During formal hearings, judicial
board members, acting as jurors,
deliberate and recommend discip-
linary action -and restitution in
appropriate cases. The amount of
restitution is proportioinate to the
severity of the offense.

Bowen, who has served as
moderator to both boards for four
years, said he has learned to trust
judgments of board members
during adjudications. “I have felt
concerned only a few times for
decisions made by students about
their peers.”

Bowen indicated there may be as
many as ten positions on both
boards to be ﬁlled as a result of the
graduation, transfer or resignation
of members. All students not on
academic or disciplinary probation
are eligible to apply for a position.
Students seeking membership on
the residence hall judicial board
must have lived in University
housing for at least one year and
must currently do so.

Applications for both boards are
available in 'room 104 Schenley
Hall. Deadline for applications is
Oct. 1, after which all applicants
will be interviewed by a committee
representing each of the student
governmental bodies. Final
recommendation for board appoint-
ment by the committee will be
made by Oct. 8 to Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs Alfred Moye and
Director of REsidence Life Fred
Fonseca.

tion regarding the Student Code of -I

The Pittsburgh Public Theater

will open its second season this
month with a world premiere
translation of Anton Chekhov’s
Uncle Vanya.

Michael Henry Heim, a Russian

scholar and translator, was com-
missioned by the Public Theater to
create the new rendition of
.Chekhov’s masterpiece, written for
the Moscow Art Theater and ﬁrst
produced in 1899.

Uncle Vanya is slated for Sept.
29 through Oct. 31 under the

"fame. Carling, a veteran character

actor, recently appeared in the ﬁlm
The Sunshine Boys and has
appeared in many plays and
television programs.

Following Uncle Vanya will be
Sizwe Bansi is Dead by Ethel
Fugard, Winston ’ Ntshona and
John Kani, Nov. 10 through Dec.
12. Some of the cast has been
chosen for the work, but the
director has not yet been selected.

Sizwe Bansi concerns the
heroism of an ordinary man facing

direction of Ben Shaktman, general
director of the Public Theater, with
preview performances scheduled
from Sept. 24 to 28.

“In our vigourous translation,
Heim has captured the simplicity of
the language as well as the rich
textures of style that will make
Uncle. Vanya catapult from the
stage into our imaginations,”
Shaktman said.

According to Shaktman, Uncle
Vanya is about ordinary people who
feel their time has passed and are
still willing to risk dreaming of the
future. 1 m

Christopher Bernau, who most
recently played in the Broadway
revival of Tennessee William’s
Sweet Bird of Youth and has acted
in repertory theaters across the
country, will head the cast as
Vanya.

Dr. Astrov, Vanya’s friend who
is obsessed with the preservation of
forest beauty of Russia, will be
portrayed by Jack Ryland, a
classical actor who has performed
at both the Stratford, Conn., and
New Jersey Shakespeare festivals.

In Uncle Vanya, Chekhov has
created two remarkable young
women, Sonya, Vanya’s self-
consciously plain niece, who will be
played by Veronica Castang, and
the beautiful Yelena, Sonya’s
stepmother, played by Kent

' Wilson.

‘Together Again’

‘ has been so far.

BY RON NYSWANER

The Guild Theatre in Squirrel
Hill.
Pictures Corp., is showing 35 ﬁlms
spanning 30‘ years of Columbia's
history. I

The retrospective series began in
August and runs through Dec. 7,
with two different ﬁlms being
shown each week.

Most of the 24 ﬁlms yet to be
shown, such as Gilda which‘ begins
Nov. 24, have achieved “classic”
status. They present a star giving
his or her best-remembered per-
formance.

Other ﬁlms, including Howard
Hawks’ Only Angels Have Wings,
are important because they exem-
plify ﬁlm techniques for which
certain directors are known.

The Green Brothers, owners of
the Guild, are depending upon the
popularity of ﬁlms and the still
strong interest for nostalgia to
make the program successful. It
They feel that
their audiences consist of “ﬁlm

buffs, and people reliving the

past.”

Although some of the ﬁlms to be
shown are forgettable and unde-

Bland Brings Back Blues

BY GEORGE FAINES

Together Again...“Live” '
Bobby Bland & B.B. King
ABC Records ASD- 9317 '

Blues reunions are always
exciting and this one is no
exception. Bobby Bland and B.B.

King ﬁrst got together back in 1950 _=
when they belonged to the Beale 

Streeters, an early blues band that
also featured Johnny Ace and Little
Junior Parker.

established.

_ Bland has become one of the
leading blues vocalists and B.B.
King, well, let’s just say that every
contemporary rock guitarist (Clap-
ton, Beck, Page, etc.) learned the
blues from listening to B.B. King’s
slow, relaxed style of playing and

* singing.

Together Again...Live features
exciting versions of each artist’s
most p0Pl1lar tunes. “Let The
Goodtimes Roll” opens up the
album and really gets the crowd
moving. Right from the ﬁrst few
verses it's evident that Bland and
King are enjoying themselves and
are glad to be playing together
again.

King tells the crowd to quiet

v o 4 o - o g u v p «you've:-voo-o'v_-4-:33-»-‘.._.¢-ya....‘;“.’..,._.«..‘..-..‘_..-..‘.........,....._.....

.» >..t

Since then, both 
have gone on their own and become

    

EM.‘-

into one of the all-time classic blues
numbers, “Stormy Monday
Blues.”

Bland really shows his stuff on
this track and lets you know he has
been singing this song for over two
decades. After a few more verses,
the band goes right into “Strange

Things Happen.” Bland tells BB.

King that he wants to hear Lucille
(the name of King’s guitar) and
King responds with a pure and
simple solo straight from his soul.
This is the real thing...what
every average rock guitarist tries to
imitate. But B.B. King doesn't
need to play loud or use
sophisticated equipment, he just
lays back and plays his blues.
On “Feels So Bad,” .the band

an listen as the n rea s

rolling. When Bland asks the
crowd to help him sing, the concert
hall erupts into a massive
sing-along. /

The audience plays a major role
on this recording. Both Bland and
King are powerful performers and
know how to reach their fans. At
one point, Bland invites a young
woman in the front row to come up
on stage and sing with him.

The album closes with a
powerhouse blues medley consist-
ing of “The Thrill Is Gone” and “I
Ain't Gonna Be The First To Cry.”
This is the highlight of the album
and brings out the best of both
Bland and King. On “The Thrill Is
Gone,” King’s guitar riffs are so
painful and his voice so full of
sorrow that the crowd is mesmeri-
zed.

Very few blues artists have had
as much commercial success as
Bobby Bland and B.B. King. The
Blues is — a very basic and
down-to-earth form of music. You
can’t learn how to sing the
blues...you have to experience it.
Both Bland and King have had
their share of hard times but
they've survived and are now
getting the recognition they deser-

_ved 20 years ago.

The Band At

Mosque Show

After a two-year absence from
the Pittsburgh concert stage, the
Band makes their long-awaited
return at 8 p.m. Tuesday,
September 21 at the Syria Mosque.

The Band has always kept an
extremely low proﬁle. Their
records come in two and three
intervals, with touring almost as
infrequent. But they are, indeed,
one of the great American rock
institutions.

The members, Robbie Robert-
son, Levon Helm, Richard Manuel,
Garth Hudson and Rich Danko,
diverse Canadian and Louisiana
Cajun backgrounds.

Starting out in the early 60s as
Ronnie and the Hawks before
evolving into Bob Dylan’s backup
band, the group has quite a few
memorable record and concert
triumphs.

Cahoots, Music from Big Pink,
and Stage Fright were some of the
60s brightest moments, while Rock
of Ages is an astounding live
album.

In 1973, they played before
600,000 people at Watkins Glen,
New York, and accompanied Dylan
on his 1974 comeback tour.

On stage or on vinyl, the Band’s
dynamic rockability music has
endured the test of time.

Appearing with the Band, will be
Chris Hillman.

A former member of the Byrds,
Flying Burrito Brothers and
Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, Hill-
man is one of the pioneering names
in this country-rock ﬁeld.

BY RON SIEGEL

Overconﬁdence, the experts say,
is the only thing that can stop Pitt
from taking a. 10-0 record into
Three Rivers Stadium for its big
showdown with Penn State Nov-
ember 26. Overconﬁdence will not
be a problem for the Panthers at
7:30 p.m. tomorrow when they
meet Georgia Tech in Atlanta.

While it is true it may be
impossible for Pitt not to be
overconﬁdent against the likes of
Temple and Iouisville, the Yellow
Jackets are a horse (or insect) of a
different -color.

Nationally ranked in the presea-
son ratings, Pepper Rodgers’
troops suffered an embarrassing
27-17 loss to South Carolina last
weekend. Playing the third-ranked
Panthers is enough to get any team
sky high, but when the normally
humorous Rodgers talks with scowl
three days after the loss, the
“Ramblin’ Wreck” will be ready
for Pitt. '

Whether being ready for Pitt will
be enough for any team this year
remains to be seen. Based on the
caliber of opponent and margin of
‘victory, the Panthers are playing
college football as well as any
school in the country.

The smaller (though quickerthan

8 Notre Dame) Georgia Tech defense

will have its hands full containing
Dorsett and company.
According to Pitt defensive tackle
Don Parrish, the grass at Notre
‘Dame was so tall “you could get
lost in it if you fell down.” Dorsett
rambled for 181 yards on 22 carries
in the shrubbery.

Tech’s Grant Field (capacity
58,121) has Astroturf, and Dorsett
runs much better on the carpet.
Even Rodgers was aware of the

he noted sarcastically.

backs returned. Like Notre Dame,
the Ramblin‘ Wreck is looking for a
quarterback to get the ramblin’
goin’. Rodgers was not happy with
the performances of his two
quarterbacks last week, and almost
anybody could end up starting
behind the center tomorrow night.

At least the starting center is
deﬁnite. He’-s Leo Tierney, a 6-3,

After carefully studying ﬁlms,
Rodgers discovered that not even

sidelines. The Tech game plan will
thus be to have the offense
maintain possession for as long as
possible.

But the Tech game plan probably
won’t work. Pitt’s defense played.

Tech’s running game will present

scoreboard early, which can be
expected with a healthy Dorsett,
Rodgers will have to abandon his

pointed out, “We give everyone

The yellow jackets are much

was Notre Dame, and their
offensive line will come off the ball
“much quicker than Notre Dame,”
according to Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors.

rushing with 329.7 yards‘ per game,

  Success Story For Ed -

BY KAREN KADILAK

Ed Wilamowski’s three years at
Pitt have been eventful, to say the
least.

The Panthers’ senior defensive
end has been right in the thick of
the “Major change” in Pitt
football—-meaning three consecu-
tive winning seasons, a trip to the
Fiesta Bowl as a freshman and last
season’s decisive win over power-
ful Kansas in the Sun Bowl.

Nevertheless, all three of the

above take back seats to the last
two Notre Dame games for the

friendly, blond-haired giant. If it
were up to Wilamowski, he would
send last week's 31-10 win over‘ the
Fighting Irish to the head of the
class as his top football accomplish-
ment for some very special
personal reasons. ‘

As it now stands, Wilamowski’s
second and third choices would be
last year’s Notre Dame game (the
Panthers defeated the Irish 34-20 at

‘Pitt -Stadium- behind the . 303-yard.

performance of Tony Dorsett) and
last season’s 33-19 Sun Bowl win,
respectively.

“When you step on the ﬁeld with
Notre Dame,” Wilamowski said,
“you get this immediate feeling of
being overwhelmed. Not that
that’s a bad feeling. In fact, it’s a
pretty good feeling when you
realize you’re playing on the same
ﬁeld with the best.

“When you beat them,” Wila-
mowski went on with a smile of
satisfaction adorning his rugged

looks, “it’s a feeling that’s just
indescribable.”

For Wilamowski, such great
feelings have fortunately constitu-
ted a substantial chunk of a thus far
successful career. A two-year
letterman at Hopewell High
School, which incidentally produc-
ed Mr. T.D. himself, Tony Dorsett,
Wilamowski’s schoolboy career
was capped with a pile of college
offers including those from Michi-
gan State, Penn State, West
Virginia and Notre Dame.

Women Athletes Open

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

You could refer to the Women’s

. athletics’ 1976-77 season as mark-

ing the junior year of women’s
sports at Pitt and as ’ Sandy
Bullman’s third yearas women’s
athletic director. Not only are both
correct, they are synonymous.
Under Bullman,.the program has

expanded from semi-gloriﬁed I in-

tramurals to a network of eight
teams swimming ’)with All
America Angie Lopez), basketball,
tennis, track and ﬁeld, gymnastics,
volleyball, cross country and, now,
ﬁeld hockey.

“I think Pitt was right in the
pioneering days of women’s
athletics,” Bullman said. “Our
early years were building, struggl-
ing. This year, 'we’re, ready to
compete.” '

Unlike last year when Pitt hosted
such prestige-laden events as the
Eastern Association of Intercolleg-
iate Athleticsfor Women swimm-

-ing and» diving« championships. as . -

well as basketball regionals, no
such events (with the sole
exception of the annual Pitt
Basketball Invitational) will be held
here. _

“We’re going to take it easy this

‘t year,” Bullman said. “It was a lot

of work last year.”

The new year, which starts
tomorrow when the cross country
squad travels to California State
and Pantherette tennis swingsioff
at the Slippery Rock Invitational,

‘should have much excitement to

offer--cross country has been
elevated to varsity status, (field
hockey has been added( and the
new women's volleyball coaches
are men.

“I think it was a whole new trend
bringing in male coaches," said
Bullman. referring to new head
coach Mike Hebert and his
assistant, Richard Schall. “But
we’ve got two of the best coaches in

the country." 0
Hebert inherited a team that

went to the regional championships
in its first year of existence. ' ‘With-

Johnny Majors has no intention
of abandoning his winning ways.

Booters Win Home Opener,

  Flow Past Bearcats, I-0  

BY JIM LEWIS

Did you ever try to stop a ﬂood
with a spaghetti strainer? ‘

St. Vincent tried—and got very
wet.

The Pitt Soccer team flooded St.
Vincent’s defensive zone non-stop
Wednesday night to earn a 1-0
home-opener shutout at Pitt
Stadium and even its water mark at
1-1.

Despite the fact that the score
was low, don’t be fooled—the
Panthers thoroughly dowsed their
opponents. As a matter of fact,
there isn’t a newspaper long
enough to list all the scoring
opportunities Pitt had. They just
couldn’t sink the ball into the net.

“The way we moved the ball,”
Pitt Head Coach Leo Bemis said
afterwards, “we should have
scored a couple more goals. But St.

Seasons

the backbone of his team exper-
ienced juniors, Pantherette volley-
ball might be the sport to watch.

Field hockey is the cub in the
family of full-sized panthers. “It’s
going to be a very difﬁcult
season," Bullman said. “I’ll be
the first to admit it and I think the
coach (Janet McDowell) and the
players will be the second."

The main problem is with
recruiting. The decision to add
ﬁeld hockey was made in March.
By then, the high school season
was over and other schools had
scooped up the prize recruits. The
team makes its debut next week in
the preliminary to the Pitt-temple
football game.

Tennis coach Nancy Gordon
started off last year with an
undefeated fall season. Recruiting,
according to Bullman, was excel-
lent and should not only ﬁll the
gaps from graduations and trans-
fers. but it might also provide
sophomore Maria Paris with strong

- competition in practice. ~ ' ' ' - ' ' - - '

Vincent played the way they had to
play. They were ‘big and strong.”

Yes, they deﬁnitely were. The
Bearcats utilized their abnormal
physical strength by playing a
hitting game.

“They were so big, they were
wearing us down,” Tom Murphy,
senior back, commented. “They
had one or two real big guys.”

But the only hitting St. Vincent
was to experience was the
Panthers’ brushing past them as
Pitt ran by with yet another
offensive rush. '

Early in the ﬁrst half, it was all
Pitt opportunities, but no Pitt goal.
A scufﬂe for the ball in the Bearcat
goalcrease, in which four different
Panthers swiped at it, was stopped
when a psyched-up St. Vincent
goalie fell on top of the ball. Then a
penalty kick in front of the Bearcat
net forced the St. Vincent coach to
put EVERYONE in front of the
goal, enabling them to block the
shot. There was also a breakaway
that was thwarted by the opposi-

tion’s netminder. Not to mention a ’
number of balls put in play deep in V

Bearcat territory.

Finally, Mark Nigh came
through. Midway through the ﬁrst
half, Nigh ﬁred a shot cleanly past
the helpless St. Vincent goalie after
taking a rebound from a Randy
Gyory shot.

“I shouted to Randy to let the
shot go,” Nigh explained. “The
rebound came to me and I aimed
for the right corner. I knew it was
going in."

Gyory and freshman Rick Roccon
were credited with assists on the
scoring play to give Pitt the 1-0
win. Roccon, playing in his ﬁrst
