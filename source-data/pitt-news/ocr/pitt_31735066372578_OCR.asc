If President Reagan has his way,
all graduate-students will soon be
ineligible for guaranteed student
loans.

The president’s budget proposal
for the next fiscal year calls for
complete elimination of guaran-
teed loans to graduate students,’
which allows students to borrow
up7 to $5,000‘per year, said Dan
May, associate director of student
aid.oIf Congress passes the propos-
al, May said, the loans would end
April 1, 1982.

“I think it wi-ll go through,”
May, said. “Unless college officials
and students motivate themselves
to do everything they can to fight
this, the proposal probably will be
passed.” ' °

Guaranteed student-loans are the
primary source of financial aid for
Pitt graduate students, Mav said.

he wants the students to relay their

  Grade Inﬂation

Irwin Schulman,
College of Arts and
Sciences Dean

By LYNNE LACEY

When it comes to fighting
inflation, perhaps Pitt should
take a lesson from President
Reagan. Only in Pitt’s case,
supply-side economics might
be replaced by pluses or
minuses. '

Grade inflation—the ten-
dency of instructors to only give
grades of C or better—is appar-
ently well established at Pitt, at
least according to some faculty
members and students.

‘installed to curb the effects of an

inflated three-point system,
according to Dean Irwin Schul-
man of the College of Arts and
Sciences.

“Adding pluses and minuses
to grades aides teachers by giv-
ing them some power over the
inflated grading system,” com-
mented Dean Schulman. “Pre-
cise discriminations between
grades can be made and a more
refined judgement about stu-
dents’ work is also possible.”

During the mid-19705 when
Robert Marshall was the CAS
dean, a committee was
appointed to examine Pitt’s sys-
tem of grading and to make
recommendations for possible

 
  

According to Schulman, “the ~
pattern of grade inflation” was

one of the issues under
investigation.

“The old way was a straight
five-point grading system, with
grades of A, B, C, D and F.

, Almost no D5 or F5 were being

given, and that is still the case.
A more exact subdivision of
grades was necessary for the
sake of precision, to counter the
inaccuracy of an inflated three-
point system. With a B being
considered equal to a C, making
a C was thought of as failing.
Some additional means of eva-
luation was, and is,.necessary.”

Theodore Windt,
Speech Professor

Speech Professor Ted Windt
of Pitt’s speech department has
no difficulty with grade
inflation.

“I give Ds and F5, and
because my students know it,
they work all that much
harder," Windt says.

“When I was in graduate
school, I was told that B min-
uses and C pluses were given
when the professor didn’t know
what other grade to give. He

either wasn’t sure of the per-
_son’s ability or just couldn't
make up his mind. Since I
began teaching here 13 years
ago, I have never given a minus
and have given pluses only
when they were earned and well

pluses or minuses because I give
objective rather than essay
tests.”

One alternative to plus and
minus grades is “a direct recom-
mendation from professors,”
Windt suggests. “Transfer stu-
dents’ grades are less reliable
because of grade inflation. A
direct recommendation would
be more accurate.

“I am not fighting a war to
abolish the plus/minus system.
I’ve just decidedxthat it’s not
right for my situation."

state-related universities are_fortu-
nate enough to receive the amounts
that they did, considering that this
is a time of budgetary restra-int and
that many budgetary items were
cut.

Chip Roth, SGB liason to the
committee, met with a few repre-
sentatives while he was in Harris-

burg. According to Roth, the

representatives’ reaction to the
budget package were mixed.
Representative Ron Cowell (D.-
Allegheny) was reportedly very

- pleased with both increases,

“Cowell believes that this shows

that higher education is favored by
the administration,” Roth said.
“Cowell considers these increases
to be the administration's way of
making up for past failures to ade-
quately support education.”
’ Roth said that “the SGB intends
to keep close tabs on the situation
in Harrisburg. We will do all that
we can to try to help Pitt obtain as
much state aid as possible.”

Roth also said that “It is possible
that the tide may turn against us,”
meaning that a battle may be brew-
ing against increases for state-
related universities.

Connie Kreischer, chairperson

Subcommittee on Education.

“She said that the budget would

that we shouldn't expect much

t The much talked about tlguies,
presented on Tuesday by Governor
Thornburgh, included:

1. $69,691,000 for general and
educational costs, up almost $3.9
million from last year.

2. $2,960,000 for student aid, up
$31,000 which restores the amount
to the 1980-81 level. ,

3. $4,285,000 for medical-related .

The six percent increase ear-
marked for Pitt is about to three
percent below last year's inflation
rate and the projected rate for this
year, so students here can expect
more than the five percent tuition
increase already slated for next fall.

With this fact in mind, Connie
Kreischer said it would be a great
idea for students to write their leg-
islators in‘Harri‘sburg in order to’
let them know of the students
plight. She also said that the fed-

‘ eral level is where the real concern

should lie. This fact is illuminated
when one considers the proposed
25 percent cut in federal aid to stu-
dents who need loans.

In his message delivered before a
joint session of the General Assem-
bly, Thornburgh said, “As the
dream of a "college education...
becomes more difficult for increas-
ing numbers of young people to
pursue, it is incumbent upon us to
take what measures we can, with
the resources available, to keep that
dream alive for...our leaders of

Your Hopes Up

Pitt administrators can stop looking into their fiscal
crystal ball now that the governor has presented his budget
recommendations to the state legislature. Now’s the time
to start praying.

As of the first day of legislative hearings on the proposed’
budget, the trench warfare begins. Pitt’s lobbyists—both
students and staff—will increase their pressure on state
legislators. Legislators will, as usual, complain that the
state-related universities such as Pitt are wasting the Corn-
monwealth’s precious tax dollars. And, as usual, there will
be countless delays, possible reductions and a lot of
changes between what the governor recommends and what
Pitt eventually receives. '

It is always that last factor, however, that makes Pitt’s
level of state funding so uncertain during any given fiscal
year.‘ Pitt’s»l978 appropriation had been delayed almost
six months past the beginning of that fiscal year while the
state legislature squabbled over revenue sources. As an
added ribbon on Pitt’s funding package, Gov. Milton
Shapp also slashed the appropriation by $1.2 million for
good measure. Five-year seniors will remember a comical
side to that fiscal nightmare when the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and Pitt Stadium were put as collaterafjust in case the
university was forced to borrow money because of lack of
state support.

Or, as a more recent example of the distance between
what the governor recommends and what Pitt receives,

/there was the great dispute over the price of liquor and

state-related funding during fiscal year 1981. At some
point between the time the governor recomgiended Pitt
receive $71.07 million in state support ai1d_then said the
university would have to suffer a 10 percent across-the-
boardlcut in that appropriation, two crucial. sources of
state revenue were pulled out tromiunder the governor’s
feet, forcing a possible reduction in the Pitt
appropriation.

One of those two sources of revenue, a $26 million price
hike on liqour sold in the state, was eventually restored,
and Pitt received its appropriation—albeit, four months
after the start of the fiscal year.

Fresh in the mind of all Pitt administrators, however,
was the 1 percent across-the-board slash in 1982 state sup-
port the governor requested and received earlier this year.
In this case, in which Pitt’s spending plans were cut by
almost $800,000, the state budget had already been passed
by the legislature and approved by the governor.

What can we expect‘when this July 1 rolls around?
Hopefully, nothingilike what has happened in previous
years. But who knows, if worse comes to worse, we may see
a combination of previous budget dilemmas during this

, volatile election year. Education funding on the. federal

level, as students will see when they apply for financial
aid, is not exactly the highest of priorities in President's
Reagan's proposed budget. Whether or not these ‘senti-
merits will trickle down to the state and local level is yet to
be seen, although Pitt students should be prepared for the
worst.

In the meantime, Pitt administrators such as Chancellor
Wesley Posvar would be wise to temper some of their
glowing commendations of the governor's budget
recommendations.

It would save both adminstrators and the university a lot
of face when the budget battles get fierce in the Harrisburg
trenches.

lvledical School Critics Hibernating

Dear Edi tor:

In the face of serious questions
about declining quality, the threa-
tened_ closing of programs (e.g.
geography), skyrocketing tuitions
and marginal accreditation of its
medical school, we find the univer-
sity in the midst of a silent winter
and deep sleep. Campus and city
newspapers, legislators, students
and citizens of Pennsylvania have
raised important questions and
demanded accountability of uni-
versity administrators. Only a few
months ago, the editor of the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette wrote: “The
medical school is a public institu-
tion, dependent upon public sup-
port and financing. The sooner it
realizes the importance of operat-
ing in public, seeking public sup-

. port to overcome its weaknesses

rather than hiding them, the more
credibility it will have.” Within the
past week, medical students
expressed “lack of confidence in
the integrity of the university
administration.” The students
were reacting to the fact that de-
spite the criticism of the Liaison

I Committee on Medical Education

(LCME) that Pitt did not permit
sufficient student input into aca-
demic decisions, Dean Donald
Leon ignored this recommenda-
tion and submitted a detailed status
report to the LCME “with abso-
lutely no student contribution.”
Furthermore, the report, which is

a still secret, was submitted -w:i~thmit

input or review by the medical .
school faculty.

Despite the fact that the pro-
found and inseparable problems of
tuitions, accreditation, and clinical
practice plans remain unresolved,
there is no dialogue amongst
faculty members, administrators,
students or trustees—we have only
the great silence.

Careful reading of the dean's
recent interview with Debra Meyer
of the University Times, in which
he claims the medical school is
“healthy,” provides little basis for
optimism. But then the dean is
always optimistic. Recall that it
was only last summer that Dean
Leon wrote in The Pitt News:
“Pitt's medical school is a member
of the prestigious 13 school consor-
tium with" Harvard, Yale, Johns

Hopkins, Columbia, Cornell, ,,
— Rochester, Chicago,

Stanford,
Washington University and several
others. Pitt’s membership in the
consortium indicates that Pitt has
stature among other well-regulated
medical schools." just this week,
the LCME report came out and
here are some of the facts. The
‘‘consortium'' medical schools
scored very well: with the excep-
tion of the University of Pitts-
burgh, all_of these schools were
accredited for seven-l0 years (aver-_,
age, greater than eight years). What
about Pitt?, Pitt is one of the 16 out

‘of some l20 U.S. medical schools

that were accredited for three years
or less! And what other institutions
are in this new marginal accredita-
tion consortium?: The Ponce
School of Medicine in Puerto Rico,
Northeastern Ohio University, the
University of Oklahoma, Texas
Tech School of Medicine and the
University of South Alabama. If
Pitt continues to apply the quick-
fix to its problems, we may see our-
selves realigned in a new
consortium, or worse. .

Where does this leave us? The
dean would have us believe that
“outside restraints"—his euphem-
ism for state funding—are the
source of our problems and that
only an infusion of state funds can
solve them. He does this to deflect
attention away from the practice
plans of the clinical departments of
the school of medicine.

An editorial in The Pitt News
referred to the practice plans as a
complicated issue. The editor over-
estimates the task: it is not that the
clinical practice plans are too com-
plex to comprehend——it is that
facts and information about the
plans have been withheld from us.
In light‘ of the high caliber of

“It is not that the pratice
plans are too complex to
comprehend - it is that
facts and information
about the plans have
been withheld from us.”

reporting emanating from The Pitt
News these days, I am quite certain
that if the facts were available, the
practice plans could be readily

understood by all.. Perhaps that is

what the administration fears!
What are some of the outstand-
ing questions regarding the prac-

tice plans that require answers._
First, what does the dean mean,

when he -claims the plans are
reviewed by —a “board of overseers”?
Who are these overseers? A budget
and finance committee of the
faculty senate was told recently by a

senior medical school administra-/

tor that thepractice plan audits are
reviewedﬁoutinely by the chancel-
lor's office. But.Senior V~ice‘Chan-
cellor for Administration Jack
Freeman told the same committee
that no one in the Cathedral has
ever seen the audits. We need to
know who reviews the clinical
practices plans.

A second important question is:
Where do the tens of millions of
dollars in practice plan l‘(’\'(’nU(‘S go

each year? In his interview with
Meyer, Leon indicated that the
practice plans “generate income
for the school.” Bl).l'[-in his 40-page
report to the governor, the dean
presents an operating budget
report showing that for the past
five years during the period when
all of the practice plans came into
being, there was no increase what-
soever in revenues to the medical
school budget from clinical activi-
ties. Every faculty member and aca-
demic unit of the University of
Pittsburgh must be accountable for
their activities. We have every right
to know where the clinical income
goes. Furthermore, we must know
what agreements ’ took place
between hospital administrators,
heads of clinical practice plans and
the dean and what equations were

‘agreed upon that might curtail the

rate of flow of hospital-derived

.revenue to the school of medicine.

Granted, a degree of enthusiasm
is warranted in the medical school
on the hiring of a directorof basic
science. But in the absence of close
scrutiny and a profound restructur-
ing of the clinical practice plans, I
am afraid the dean is still looking
for the quick-fix to our fundamen-
tal and deep-seated financial prob-
lems. It is worth noting that the
$1.3 million required to set up the
new director is coming from under-
graduate tuitions. ~ ,.

A great university such as ours
must- certainly possess intelligent
and thoughtful faculty members

- and administrators who can sort

out the practice plans and bring
them. under the proper control and
faculty oversight. Perhaps even an
ombudsman from the state legisla-
ture should participate in this
analysis. To accomplish this we
need publicized guidelines and
agreements. The precipitous
decline in Pitt's national'reputa-
tion began in 1976, the same year
the practice plans were initiated.
Theschool of medicine will never
regain the prestige it so recently
enjoyed until the practice plans are
harnessed. Thepractice plans have
Pl_1S_hed us closer to the day when
Pitt will only accept medical
school applicants who can afford
the tuition.

_ If the practice plans and the
insatiable greed of their leaders are
not at the heart of the medical
school's problems, then the study
will still have been usefulforit will
cause us to look elsewhere for
solutions.

‘ A great university needs facts and
information if it is to identify and
correct its problems and shortcom-
ings. The great silence at Pitt
smacks of_ an arrogance of power

that must be ended before it deg.“

Whether or ‘not the Pitt Pan-
thers have a top-caliber volley-
ball squad may be answered this
weekend at the Pitt Invita-‘
tional, a 16-team tournament
featuring several top~ranked
American and Cc .;adian teams.

The quality 0. he Pitt tour-
nament field is rated one. of the J
best in the nation, second only
to the California National
Tournament, according to Pitt
Coach and tournament director
Ray Reilly. "

The talented field —includes
Eastern champion third-ranked
Penn State and No. 9 Ohio
State, which finished fourth last
year in the NCAA champion-
ships. Also competing will be
Ball State, the Midwest Inter-

collegiate Volleyball Associa-

ti_on’s No. 2-ranked.team, and , 2

California State at Northridge,
No. 7 in the state of California.

, The Canadian teams entered
are Winnipeg and Manitoba
which are both battling for No.
2 and No. 3 in Canada, and
Western Ontario, which Pitt
beat twice this season.

The rest of the field includes
Pitt’s Eastern League foes,
George Mason and West Point,
and Tennessee, Indiana of
Pennsylvania, ranked No. 1 in

' the small college division of
western Pennsylvania last year,
Grove City, Edinboro, Slippery
Rock, and Allegheny at
Meadville.

Penn State won the Pitt tour-
nament lastiyear before a crowd

of over 300. The Panther spikers
madeit to the quarterfinals, los-
ing to the University of Queens
of Ontario, Canada. _

The teams are divided into
four-team pools with the top
two teams advancing to the
play6ffs.

Pitt’s main competitor in its _
pool will be Ball State, who beat
Pitt in the semi-finals of the
Ohio State Invitational, 16-14,
12-15 and 15-8. .

According to Reilly, his spik- ‘
ers could have beaten Ball State
in that match.

_“Our game plan will be the
same against Ball ‘State. We
played them well and I don’t ‘
think. I want to change any-
thing. We’ll play aggressive
defense and keep up our block-

Pitt Volleyball lnviteFeaturesTop Field J

ing,” Reilly said.

If the Panthers make it to the
semifinals, they could face
Coach Jim Smoot’s Ohio State
Buckeyes, a team Pitt didn’t
have much luck against this
year, losing 5-15 and 11-15 at
Ohio State.

“Against Ohio State we had a
great mental breakdown,”
Reilly said. “Physically, I think
we’re stronger. We are capable
of beating them.”

The Panthers will be without
the services of freshman Tony
Zortea. Zortea suffered torn
knee cartilage at the Ohio State
tournament; Zortea will receive
therapy for two weeks and then
the team doctors will determine
if he needs surgery.

“Zortea will be greatly

missed, especially this week-
end,” said Reilly. “He’s our best
"jumper, but we have people
that can fill the gap.”

Zortea was sharing duties _
with Gene Larson and Dan
O’Donnell at the outside hitter
positions. Reilly said he will go
back tohis original line-up of
Larson and~O’Donnell.

“We’ve been working on our
all-around game ‘this. week,”
Reilly said. “I’m sure the guys
are looking forward to this
weekend. It’s always nice to win
your own tournament." ‘

The Pitt Invitational runs
Friday from 4 to 9:30 and Satur-
day 8 to 7, when the finals are
scheduled to start.

All Pitt students will be
admitted free with a Pitt ID.

Chip Watkins was used by Pitt coach Roy Chipman against the Bonnies to help out

off the boards.

“We may as well have played the

game without refs,” said one Lady . -_

Panther in reaction to Pitts 81-67
.loss to the Lady Lions of Penn
State. The outcome of the game fell
completely into the hands of the
two referees, and if you live in the
University Park »-area, you don't
make your ‘money calling fouls
against Penn State.

The Lady Panthers made it to
the free throw line just nine times
in the entire game. Of those nine
trips, one came in the first twenty
minutes of play, and six came in
the final 4:42 of the game. Mean-
while, Penn State erected a second

 

home at the foul line, visiting it 34

times. The Lady Lions made good
on 23, thus making up for their
deficit in field goals, where the
Lady Panthers held a 30-29‘edge.
“Several poor calls at a crucial
point ended our momentum and
virtually ended the game,” said
assistantcoach Randy White.
White was referring to a twoand
a half minute stretch which started
with the Lady Panthers closing in,
52-46. Four consecutive question-
able calls against the Lady Pan-

thers allowed Penn State to build

up a 61-46 lead. Two Lori Lewman
baskets and a Debbie Lewisjumper
brought Pitt back within nine, 61-
52. 7

Apparently the referees felt that
that was too close for comfort. Jen-
nifer Bruce was whistled out of the
game with six minutes to go.Carol
Dugan joined her one minute later,
and Lewman was saddled with her
fourth personal foul. The Lady
Lions ran up their biggest lead of
the night, 71-52:

Despite sitting out the last six
minutes of play, Jennifer Bruce led
Pitt with 16 points. Lewman

Maybe the only thing more
unpredictable than
Panther basketball team
weather. Then again, maybe not.
Take last night’s 61-57 loss to St.

Bonaventure. Who could have pre- ,

dictedit?
Who could have predicted that

Pitt, a 30 point winner over St.
Bonaventure on Jan. 20, would

lose, and especially the way they
did? Like being totally unable to
box out Eric Stover and Rob Gar-

bade, the Bonnies two muscle men. .

Like having the offense go poof
when St. Bonaventure went man to
man. And oh, those rebounds. «
Unpredictablity - is about. the
only thing Pitt Coach Roy Chip-
man was sure of when the season
started. With his team barely out of
diapers, Chipman’ knew he’d get,40
minutes of hard basketball and the

rest, well,-cross your fingers. Some-.

times brilliance, sometimes
ineptness.
Chalk up last night for
ineptness.

“We got totally outplayed. Their
inside kids beat .us all night. Our
big kids didn’t go to the board,
didn’t play good defense inside,”
Chipman said after the game, then
adding bluntly, “I am not happy
with the way we played.”

Why should he be? With Pitt 4-4
and coming off two good wins on"
the road over Massachussets and
Rhode Island, Chipman felt his
team was gearing itself for a nice

fter Penn

chipped in 14 and Lewis 12.

“We've been defeated, but we
haven’t defeated ourselves,” said
Lady Panther coach Judy Saurer.
“We still have a chance to make the
play-offs, and the players are aware
of this. We haven’t given up by any
means.”

Sin'ce Pitt is an independent
school, the selection process for the
NCAA tournament will be much
the same as it was for the AIAW
tournament, according to
Women's Athletic Director Sandra
Bullman. The national selections
committee will collect the season
results and seed the teams accord-

the Pitt,
is the

little run going into‘ the Eastern 8
tournament. Now, they have to
hang on to the fourth spot in the
standings to assure themselves of a
homecourt advantage in the first

round of the playoffs. You know 

whose right behind? St.

Bonaventure. ’
The Bonnies won the crucial

contest not by slowing it down as

_everyone had expected, bu_t by

bruising the Panthers. Stover and
Garbade cleaned off the rebounds
and freshman Rob Samuels took
care of the rest. Not that Samuels
scored a heck of a lot, only 11. The
freshman shut down Pitt’s offense;
Clyde Vaughn. Vaughn, who had
11 first half points, was held to four
in the second half by Samuels.

End of Vaughn, end of offense,
end of game;

The loss makes the Pitt-
Duquesne game on Sunday that

much more crucial. Granted it ' "5
the Civic 

Pitt-Duquesne, ' and
Arena will be a hive of emotion,
but there's more. St. Bonaventure is
breathing down Pitt’s neck, and

iv the Dukes, now 4-6 after the loss to
West‘ Virginia, need‘ this one bad.

“We have to get ready for
Duquesne, it’s not going to be an
easy task,” Chipman sajd_

It certainly won’t get any easier if
Pitt doesn't rebound. Against the
Bonnies they were outrebounded
35-25. Bruce Atkins likes those fig-
ures. So does Joey Meyers. They
both ‘made the paint their home in

ingly. The top eight teams will
receive bids to play in the tourna-
ment and advance to the regional
finals. The Lady Panthers are still
very much in the running, but a
strong showing in the final four
games of the season is vital.

The Lady Panthers. now 14-10,
w1ll'host Villanova Monday even-
ing in their last home game of the
season. In an effort to attract more

Cut Times
Against

Tennessee

By SCOTT DELLETT

There are many reasons for the
Pitt Lady Panther swim team to be
ready for the meet tommorrow
against Tennessee in Knoxville: for
the whole team, this is the first trip
to a highly-regarded swim team
outside the East, for some team
members, this is a chance to qualify
for Easterns and finally, for Pitt
Coach Dave Belowich, it is another
match-up between him and his
swimming mentor, volunteer
Coach Terry Carlisle.

“Tennessee has a good pool and
good team,” Belowich said. “With
the exception of the traveling, this
is a good experience for the team.
The meet establishes ourselves as
swimming the best teams around
the nation, and it enhances our
credibility.” '

Four swimmmers still need to
qualify for Easterns, and Belowich
is looking forward for ‘strong

}"‘performances.

“Estelle Grant, Janine Scooti,
Margie Curry and Beth Hitchcock
still have not qualified, although
all their times are close to the stand-
ards. This is a big meet. It would be
nice to have the whole team qualify
for Easterns,” Belowich said. I

If that isn’t incentive enough,
than trying to defeat the man who
got Belowich started in coaching
certainly is. ‘ .

“Since we are close friends, it is
fun to go against each other,” Belo-
wich said. “I worked with him as
an assistant and co-coach, and it
would be nice if the student gets to
teach the_ instructor.” A

Pitt Lady Panther swimming co-
captain Julie Terrell will rarely be
confused as a silent, show-by-
example type of leader. In fact, Pitt
Coach Dave Belowich says he
always knows that the co-captain is
in the pool because “you can h'ear
her.”

Along with her loud voice, Ter-
rell’s antics often provide a wel-
come break from the dull
lap-after-lap, flip-turn after flip-
turn monotony of practice. Cer-
tainly performing weird dives off
the Trees Pool balcony, attacking
swimmers while doing laps, pour-
ing ice down people’s swimsuits
and telling jokes to get out of laps

 couldn't be called your typical

practice session.

“I have always been crazy in the
pool,” Terrell said. “Practice has
two sides, a serious side where you
work on getting in shape and a fun
side. If practice wasn't fun, then it
is hard to keep on going.” ‘

After last year, ‘Terrell herself
thought of not going on in swim-
ming. She was dissatisfied with her
performance in her sophomore and
junior years, after an outstanding
performance in her first year at
Pitt, when she was _a three-time All-
'America on relay teams and a
national qualifier in four other
events.

“I felt like I didn’t do as well in
my sophomore and junior years as
in my freshman year,” Terrell said.
“I didn’t have my head together on
swimming and I was experiencing
problems with motivating myself.
My standards were high and when I
didn’t reach these goals, I was
disappointed.”

With the arrival of Belowich
from Florida State, Terrell’s
thoughts of quitting soon subsided
and her attitude changed.

“Dave called the whole team up
over the summer,” said Terrell. a
native of Silver Springs, Md. “I was

really impressed with his plans for
the upcoming season.” V"

Another reason for her enthusi-
astic return to her senior year was
her selection as co-captain of the
team. Terrell admits she didn’t
expect it.

“I was surprised that I was
elected,” Terrell said. “It is a real
honor that the team picked me as
one of the two captains.”

As for her opinion on her leader-
ship role, Terrell said, “I don’t feel
I have a lot of pressure being cap-*
tain. The people on the team are
very mature and they can handle
problems very well. Nancy (Henry,
the other co-captain) and I make
sure that everything goes smoothly
and that we work as a unit. We also
serve as a go-between with the team
and Dave.”

Terrell has nothing but praise
for the job Henry is doing as a co-
captain.

“Nancy is a_good team leader.” .

Hobbled Grapplers
Visit No. 12 Penn 82‘.

By L.T. DINGER

If he is truly intent on easing

suffering, the team doctor for the

Pitt wrestling team might decide to
distribute blindfolds and cigarettes

to the injury-plagued Panthers as —

they head into tomorrow's match
with No. 12 Penn State.

The Nittany Lions, riding a
seven—match win streak, will face
an outmanned Pitt team that will
be without five of its 10 regular
starters. The Panthers, weakened
lately by injuries and illness, enter
their third-consecutive contest
against a Top 20—ranked team.

V Over the weekend, Pitt fell to No.

17 Navy and No. 7 North Carolina.
Penn State, 9-3, has lost to
second-ranked Oklahoma State,
No. 4 Oklahoma and Michigan,
while Pitt enters the match on a
skid——the Panthers have dropped
four of their last five matches.
The reshuffled Pitt lineup be-
gins with three substitutions in the
first four matches tomorrow.
Freshman Rich Esswein (4-9) con-
tinues to lead off the match for Pitt
at 118 pounds, but at 126 pounds,
another freshman, John Lis, steps
in for Joe Throckmorton, one of

the Panthers’ most successful
wrestlers this season.

Tim Dinger will replace the.
injured Craig Richey at 134
pounds for Pitt to take on Penn-
State’s Bill Marino.

At 142 pounds, Pitt’s third sub-
stitute, John Settinari, steps into
the lineup for injured Jeff Gordon
to wrestle John Manotti.

Doug Haines takes the mat for
the Panthers at 150 pounds against
Lion Eric Childs. Pitt’s Jeff jelic
(14-2-I) will take on tough Eric
Brugel at 158 pounds in a match
which promises to be one of the
highlights of the evening.

With senior Eric “Pepe” Harris
taking the weekend off to get mar-
ried, Pitt Coach Rande Stottlemyer
still hasn't decided whom to wres-
tle in the 167 pound spot against
the'Lions’ John Hanrahan.

At 177 pounds, Panther Jeff
Wilps faces Penn State’s Bobby
Harr. Mark Rich remains in the
lineup for Pitt in the 190 pound
slot. At heavyweight, freshman
Dennis Atiyeh, a bright spot last
weekend for Pitt with three wins in
four matches, wrestles Jim Sleeper.

The match at Penn State tomor-
row begins at 7:30 p.m.

Jeff Je|lc’s 14-2-1 record has been a bright spot on the

‘Panther wrestling team.

Panthers I
Tune Up

ForEast

By SEAN’ BARNES’

The Pitt Panther mens' swim
team left early this morning for
Indiana University for Saturday’s
meet with the Top 10-ranked
Fightin’ Hoosiers in what should
be their fastest meet, as well as
being their last dual meet, of the
1981-82 Pitt swimming season.

Although Coach Fred Lewis and
his swimmers realize they won’t
beat Indiana, Lewis is looking for
fast NCAA Eastern and National

qualifying times from many of his ‘ :

swimmers. Indiana, coached by
former U.S. Olympic coach ‘Doc’
Councilman, has beaten all its Big
10 opponents and will be anxious
to meet the defending Eastern
champion Panthers.

Pitt met Indiana last year in the
Panthers’ first meet of the season.
Although the Panthers lost at
Trees Hall, the times turned in
were outstanding for November.

“It will be the perfect tune-up
meet for Easterns,” said Lewis.
“The psych of swimming against
an Olympic coach and Olympic
swimmers will bring the best out in
everyone. For this, I’m putting ev-

eryone in the events they know

they’ll swim at Easterns.”

Lewis is already preparing his
team for Eastern Regionals, to be
held at Pitt's Trees Hall Pool Mar.
4-6. “We’ll need to remain solid as
a team,” said Lewis. “We’ll need
total performance (at Easterns)
from everyone. The swimmers who
will be going national pace will do
their national times. lt’s the kids
that make the consolation places
that will win or lose the meet.”

With the top 16 places being
given team points, Lewis said. every
swimmer and every event will be an
impotant oneif Pitt is to retain its
Eastern title. ,

A week ago, one would have said
that West Virginia would upset the

Panthers at this year’s Easterns, 

based on WVU’s regular season
win over the Panthers. But lately
every day seems tcrbring more hope

1 for Pitt. Lewis has recently learned

that West Virginia has injury and
disciplinary problems that have
dropped two, maybe even three,
members from their team. Also, the
late season strength of Maryland,
especially in West Virginia’s
strong events, may enable Pitt to
repeat last season’s win over WVU
at Easterns.

Easterns will consist of prelimi-
naries in the afternoon and finals
in the evening. Advance ticket sales
have already begun, with seats
going at $2 for students and $5 for
others. The tickets‘ are good for aiiﬁ,
three days of competition. ‘The K
meet may be covered by cable
television. -,__ _

J’ Terrellin
-New Role

I
continued from page nine

Terrell said. “The two of us work
well together. If there is something
I don’t cover, then she goes over it.”
Belowich believes Terrell has
accepted the leadership role well.
“Julie takes the role of captain
5 very seriously,” Belowich said.
“She is always willing to help the
other members of the team. She
always makes me aware of any
problems with the team and gives
her opinion on my approach. She
has a good working relationship
with the team. She is interested in

4

what is going on and she asks good 

questions that are a delight to

answer as a coach.” -

Terrell’s new-found approach to
swimming has also impressed
Belowich.

“Her concentration is a sign of
maturity,” Belowich said. “She
understands the physical and men-
tal aspects of swimming fast. She
has been working hard in the pool
and on the weights and the results
are she is swimming very fast. I
have nothing but admiration and
respect for her and she will be a big

 wjpss to the ‘team next year.”

Terrell shares the same kind of
admiration for Belowich.

“I am more impressed with Dave
now,” Terrell said. “He has helped
me out both as a swimmer and a
person. Before, I had no idea how I
would do this season. Iarn pleased 3
with my results and trainig. I trust
him with the rest of my swimming
career. Also, because of him, I
understand people and deal with
them better.” «

Before the season started, Terrell
refused to set any swimming goals
like the ones she made earlier in her
career. But as the season pro-
gressed, she has set several goals for
herself and the team for the rest of

.. the season. '

if “Since Dave is a goal-oriented
coach, he has developed both team— he
and personal goals,” Terrell said.
“Since the beginning of the season,

I have developed a lot of goals. I
want to make nationals in several 
individual events, reach All-
America status again, and perform
well in easterns. As for the team, we
would like to win easterns and per—
form well at nationals, placing in
the Top 10. ‘i

As for continuing her swimming
career, Terrell has no plans to
extend it beyond her college days.

“My swimming career will end
after this season,” Terrell said. “I
plan to go to graduate school for
international affairs. I want to

I Y’3’pllore different things and other
opportunities. - "

“When.swimmin'g becomes less
enjoyable, then it is time to quit,”
Terrell said. Thanks to her unique
leadership qualities, Julie Terrell
has made sure swimming doesn’t
become a boring task for the Pitt
Lady Panthers.

Pitt Signs Schilken, Stennett‘ - 

By BARRYZASLOFF

A little extra icing on the cake
never hurts.

The Pitt Panthers got just that
when they cornpleted this year's
football recruiting Wednesday by

signing Parade All-Americas Matt‘

Stennett.and Bob Schilken. '
Stennett, perhaps the most heav-

ily recruited playeriin western Pen-

nsylvania, rejected hundreds of

offers and narrowed his choices to"

Pitt, Michigan, Oklahoma, Notre
Dame and Miami of Florida, before
finally choosing Pitt.

Stennett, a 6-0 185-pound half-
back who runs a 4.45 40-yard dash,
chose Pitt because of its proximity

to his Shaler home, and because he
wanted to play for a perennial
national power. He ruled out Penn
State because ‘‘'I’ve been a Pitt fan
ever since I was a little kid."

Schilken, a Mount Lebanon
middle guard, is expected’ to play
linebacker at Pitt because of his
smallish 6-2, 2l8—pound frame-—
small, that is, for a nose guard. He
chose Pitt over Penn State, Duke
and Virginia because “I had to stay
home. My mom said she wants to
see me play.”

Schilken is interested in a medi-
cal career, and the fact that Pitt’s
medical school turns out Marcus
Welbys as well as pro football play-
ers also was a factor.

 _ragé 1'1’

Panther coach Foge Fazio was
“very pleased” that Pitt persuaded
10 western Pennsylvania players to
remain in the state and play for the
Panthers. I

Fazio gave out 16 scholarships

but said, like any coach, he
“W?ould’ve liked to have awarded
about six more. He had recruited
two top-notch running backs from
New York—Harold Gaydon and
Neil Sampson—and had invited
them to visit Pitt in December or
January, but a heavy snowfall
forced them to reschedule the visit
for last week. By then there were no
scholarships left, so Fazio had to
call the two players and 10 others
back and cancel their visits. .

Martin Thrives

By BRIAN BALK

If there is such a thing as “com-
petitive blood”, Pitt sophomore
gymnast Karen Martin has an
exceptional ‘amount. She
approaches the sport with so much

vivacity that her enthusiasm, as _

much as her ability, clearly marks
her as one of the most outstanding
members of the Lady Panther

L Gymnastics Team.

“I come from a competitive fam~
ily, both my brother and my sister
competed in sports, I guess that

influenced me,” said Martin, an

All-East Performer last year.
Martin’s competitive spirit was
nurtured ‘at Garden Spot High
School, near New Holland, Pa,
where she lettered in four sports-
field hockey, volleyball, track, and,
of course, gymnastics. Because

tomorrow at 2 p.m. at Trees
Hall in an attempt to avenge the
only loss of the 1981 season.

Despite setting a team scor-

e ing record last season at Penn
State before a 10,000-plus
crowd, Pitt still lost the meet to
the then—_No. 2 ranked Lady
Lions. _l?itt finished 11-1 and
11th ranked last season, seven
notches below Penn State. The
Lady Lions dropped into the
No. 4 spot after a sub-par per-

Dorsett. In high school,

Asberry, like Dorsett, was called a
superstar, a blue-chip recruit, and
won all-state honors as a running

back.

When former Pitt assistant coach
Bob Matey persuaded Asberry East,
many labeled him a sure-bet.

Asberry lasted with the Panther
football team for a year or so. A
shoulder injury and a personality
not suited for major college foot-
ball forced his departure from the
team last year. He had all the tal-
ent, but like so many other out-
standing athletes, his attitudes
toward big-time football interfered
in his quest for stardom. The rigor
and pressure of playing college
football was too much for him to
withstand. '

“I couldn’t take it any longer,”
said Asberry in a recent conversa-
tion in his Forbes Hall dorm room.
Asberry shifted slightly in his

chair, then added, “The pressure to »

perform well and become a starter
was ruining my life.”

“When I graduated from high
school, I wanted to be another

Tony Dorsett," he continued as his
soft voice almost drowned out by
the noise of the Comer Pyle rerun
blasting from his television and the
loud music coming from his s.tereo.
“But I found‘ out that there’s a lot

‘more to it than going out and play-

ing football.

. “I couldn't be myself," con-
tinued Asberry. “Being in crowds
constantly, I was forced to assume a
different role. I had to be extremely
careful of every word that came
from my mouth. I had to be respect-
ful even if it wasn’t deserved. Foot-
ball wanted to make me a different
person. I couldn’t handle that."

With this weighing on his mind,
Asberry turned his attention away
from football last spring and
joined the C Panther track team,
where the pressures lie soley within
the context of competition. He cur-
rently sprints the 50-yard dash and
is on the verge of qualifying for the
NCAA National Championship

next month. He also runs on the
Panther l—mile relay team.

Asberry described himself as
“individualistic", and his recent
success has convinced him that
track is his calling. Unlike foot-
ball, where the spotlight is on sev-
eral playersat once and the highest
developed state is the team, track in
most cases separates the individual
from- the team.

A runner can openly discuss
individual achievement, whereas a
football player is encouraged to
project a team image. For Asberry,
the return to the intﬁvidualism of
track, which he enjoyed in high
school, was the cure he needed after

his disappointing two—year tenure,‘-

with the Panther football team.
“It allowed me to finally do
something for myself, and at the
same time, have some privacy," he
said. “When I left the football
team, I questioned my worth as an
individual and an athlete, but track
comforted me and let me find

myself.It was an escape that I really '

needed. .

“I don’t have to worry about the
crowds anymore or watch every
word I say,” he continued. “I can
be myself again."

Would Asberry ever want
another shot at football? “I’m
happy where I'm‘ at now. This is
my life,” the fre_e-spirited ()l1"¢‘.
said. Suddenly he noticed the blast-
iiig radio and TV, and the beer cans
and the clothes scattered about his
dorm room, which’? gave the
impression a storm h/ad recently
toirclied down.

“It’s usually not quite this bad,”
Asberry joked, looking around the
room. “I just returned from a track
meet.” .

And when he left football, he
returned to owning his life.

not throw certain tricks (like a
backliand spring on the beam) but
when I’m in the meets, and I have
to throw it, I always seem to hit,”
Martin said. _, ‘

I can‘t let the beam beat me, so I

One of Martin’s favorite events is

errtly excels in. "Ilre risky n_royes

what I really‘ like about bars," Slit‘
said.

Practiciirg ll nrontlrs a year,
Martin inevitably experieirces feel-

there is nothing to look forward to.
She conibats l')oredom by liaying

By IAN; HOLAHAN

Norman and Ethel Thayer have
' come to watch life on Golden Pond
run its course. Things are always the
same here, as the loons glide effort-
 lessly through the water, oblivious to

time, age, and death. But for Norman
 Thayer (Henry Fonda) time, age and
death have become an obsession—a
dark, fearful obsession.

Old age and death may be the
themes of On Golden Pond, but
 through the spirited performances of
 Fonda and Katherine Hepburn, who
\ plays Norman's wife Ethel, this gen-
3: tle film is transformed into a charac-
3. ter study of two people whohave
‘ entwined their lives around each
other, land who cannot reconcile the.
_ fact that they may be separated. They
may be frightened of death, but will
not allow the fact that they have
grown old overwhelm them.

This is not an easy challenge for
Norman, who can no longer
remember the simplest things, like
why he made a phone call, or how to
get home from a walk in the woods.
To watch Fonda shamefully admit
such things is not to feel pity for him,
but to understand the unwelcome
experiences of growing old. The
affinity between Fonda and the
audience has nothing to do with the
sometimes maudlin screenplay,
which plies our sympathy at every
turn, but everything to do with
Fonda.

There is such a crisp snap in Nor-
man Thayer as he throws out some-
times cruel lines to those he loves the
most as a defense against the deterio-
ration of his mind and body, and such
a stubborn pride to him that we
simply cannot feel sorry for him. In
his isolated pride, which he shelters
himself in, Fonda allows us to feel the
complexities of growing old-the
T anger, the joyvof alife lived, and the
fear. A «e . if

Fonda has always been an actor you
» felt you could implicitly trust and this
performance, probably his last and
finest, explains the appeal Fonda has .,

as Chelsea, the .Thayer's long
estranged daughter, is impelling
because of the family ties, and there is
an acute poigancy to the scenes
between father and daughter, but the
role leaves her little to do. She is pres-
ent merely to wrapfup a few loose
ends, and simplify the complexities
Fonda and Hepburn _have set forth.

V TINTYPES

Pittsburgh Public Theatre
By JANE HOLAHAN

America seems to have an overly
zealous attitude about itself at the
turn of the century, as though it were
an innocent child with a triple burst
of energy and the‘ creativity to match.
Tintypes is a dizzy attempt to recap-
ture the child at full speed and it
works marvelously. There is so much
exhuberance and spirit packed into
two hours that even the hardest

gexpatriot might leave the theatre

whistling ”You’re A Grand Old Flag.”

Tintypes bombards the audience
from the very beginning—old Ameri-
can standards like ’’Hot Time In The
Old Town Tonight" and ”Meet Me In
St. Louis” flow out of the cast like
rapid cannon fire, exploding and
lighting up the stage.

What makes this musical flow like
champagne is the cast——five wonder-
ful singers who barely get a chance to
catch their breath between songs, but
manage to amaze the audience either
singly or ensemble. As soon as you
think one of the five; David Eric,
Alian Stevens, Zelda Pulliam, Pamela
Kalt and Rosemary McNamara, have
pushed a song as far as possible,
another mumber comes up with an
even better one.

Tintypes runs through dozens of old

standards, from ragtime to spirituals

‘Due to the overwhelming response

added!. 8:00 Sc 11:00 PM

as Teddy Roosevelt, among others, is
particularly amazing. He sings the
roof off the Pittsburgh Public Thea-

tre like the best broadway baritone.
Why he's not on Broadway remains a
mystery. .

The charmer of the evening is
David Eric, who plays the perennial
loser, and romantic waif. Though he
does tend to mug excessively at times
his winning characters‘ play off the
ruff and ready Teddy Roosevelt per-
fectly. For sheer bravado there's
Pamela Kalt, who quite effectively
stops the show several times. But
what really makes this revue click is
the entire cast working together.
Tintypes is overflowing to a fault-
at times there is so much going on

Up, but the cast handles the myriad of
events masterfully, and by the second
act the kinetic pace seems quite natu-
ral. Afterall, this was an America that
was moving so fast nobody had time
to breath.

The rousing Americana mood
finally leaves the audience feeling
nostalgic, and sorry for times past,
when wonder seemed a way of life.
Watching the cast’s amazement
when a new fangled invention, the
lightbulb, glows florescently is like
watching a child discover yet another
fascinating aspect of life.

It may all be a nostalgic fairy tale,
but that doesn't seem to matter

that the audience might as well give it i

:3

because for two hours all the fairy
tales come true, and everything is
just jankee doodle dandy. '

YOUR ARMS TOO SHORT TO
BOX WITH GOD ‘
Stanley Theatre

By Victor J. Grigsby

Lights glimmered, pictured win-
dows stood still, and singing voices
of Zion filled the air as the audience
sat in awe; and the cast, like angels
called from heaven, glided into their
places bursting forth into a glorious
night of gospel jubilee.

The play, Your Arms Too Short To Box
With God, is truly a blessing and a
remarkable work of art, starring
Patti Labelle. This is her theatrical
debut and she was marvelous.

Patti Labelle is a native of Phila-
delphia and like many other black
singers, laid her foundation singing
in the church. On this foundation
she stood and built successful career
as a professional singer. In the 60's,
she was lead singer in a popular
group known as Patti Labelle and the
Bluebells. They were recognized as
one of the top rhythm and blues
groups of that period. In the 70's she
recorded "Lady Marmalade" which
was an international disco anthem.

 

Since then, Patti LaBelle has per-
formed in concert as a solo artist at
Carnegie Hall, The Apollo, The
Olympia in Paris and the Drury Lane
in London.

As she stood in Your Arms Too Short
To Box With God with tears glazing her
cheek, she sang "I Love You So Much
Jesus,” reflecting her once laid foun-
dation. She spoke not of herself but
of the glory of God, thanking Him
for her waking, her voice, and her-
being in the show.

The play, performed in modern
dance and song, tells of her life,
death, and resurrection of Jesus
Christ. Twenty cast members per-
formed as though they were a multi-
tude: rising saints from graves,
bands of hallelujah angels, and.
mocking soldiers of a scarlet robe.

Although the actor of Iesus never
spoke, his actions spoke with words
of truth, humility, and grace. Lifted
like a human cross, the sweat and the
beating of his lungs transformed into
a distilled picture of suffering and
sorrow. Your Arms Too Short To Box
With God was an exhilerating even-
fng. rising higher and higher, robed
in white with a caressing glow.

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

I

We ,all know him. Call him Buffalo
Bill, or Daniel Boone, or John Wayne.
.He’s the red-blooded, all-male, all-
American hero, selfless, noble, and
fighting tirelessly to keep us safe in

‘ our beds from savage redskins, mer-

ciless Japs, dirty commie pinkos, or
whoever the currenttenemy should
happen to be. He is inseparable from
the fabric of Americanlife as apple pie
or Sears and Roebucks.

Few of us are naive enough to
accept this mythic American hero at‘
face value. But few of us also turn a
cold analytical eye on him, as Arthur
Kopit does in his savage, brooding
masterpiece, Indians.

Indians opens this week at the City
Theatre Company's new playhouse
at Sennott and Bouiquet Streets, on

the Pitt campus. The production, typ- g

ical of the Company’s work, promises
to be a vivid and challenging theatri-
cal experience. Under Marc Master-
son’s direction, Indians will feature
(among ‘other things)-Annie Oakley
sharpshooting while riding a unicy-
cle, a two-headed buffalo, a fire-
eater, authentic Indian dances
performed by a full-blooded Sioux,
and the President of the United
States portrayed by an actor who is
just over three feet tall. I

In a recent conversation I had with
him, Masterson outlined some of the
underlying ideas in Indians.
Conversation is Indians. Conversa-
tion is perhaps not the right word;
one does not really have a
conversation with Marc Masterson if
he is talking about his work. The
ideas literally fly off of him like a
showerkof incandescent sparks.

”The primary focus of the play is on
the American concept of heroes. Can
someone be a legitimate hero if the
things he was fighting for were not
so heroic? Hollywood, through its
myth of the West, has glorified geno-
cide. We accept these heroes without
knowing who they really were or
what they really did.

’’ "Indians was written in the Sixties.

It's not literally about Vietnam, but it
does deal with the way the govern-
ment tried to glorify Vietnam in
terms of truth, justice, and the Amer-
ican way. The same glorification pro-
cess was working with the genocide
committed against the Indians.
”That’s why Buffalo Bill is so
appropriate as a central character. In
real life, he considered himself a
friend of the Indians, and really did
his best to treat them honorably and
fairly. But at the same time, he was

 eating this myth of the Wild West,

through dime novels, plays, and later,
his Wild West Show. He justified the
' image of the Indian as ‘the Noble Sav-
age’ who had to be tamed or civilized.

I

-

The myth he “created got out of his
control, and he became a walking

Fred and Edward Hale, of the Council
of Three Rivers American Indian
Center, worked intimately with the
director and the actors. Fred Hale,
who dances in the show, choreo-
graphed the white actors who play
Indians. His brother Edward made
the drum used in the production,
taught an actor how to play it, and
taught other actors authentic native
American songs and chants.

But the influence of the Hale

brothers goes deeper than serving

merely as technical advisors. I talked
with John Mumper, the actor who
portrays Crazy Horse, about work-
ing with them.

"The real spiritual part of what

these guys are about came through in

instilling the Indian spirit in our
characterizations.’ It came partly
through working with the Hales on

Masterson has assembled a power-

Claire and Zack Elliot seem

‘ to have the fairytale marriage

that dreams are made of.
They're young, attractive,
successful, and, most
importantly, \ in love——or so
they think. What_ happens to
Claire and Zack is common by
any stretch of the imagination,
but it has happened and no
doubt, will happen again.

Making Love is a different kind.

of love story. It's a movie that

“explores the break-up of a

marriage but unlike the
countless pictures thathave
dealt with this theme in the
past, Making Love has a different

twist; Zack leaves his wife’

because of his attraction . to
other men. What makes Making
Love such a bold film is not just
the subject matter alone, but

approach to a delicate matter. It
is such a contemporary picture
that, if it were put in‘ a time
capsule and discovered on a
hundred years, .a quick glance
at history "would say that it
couldn't have been made
before 1982.

Kate Jackson has the role of
Claire, the wife who is left by
her husband, Zack (Michael
Ontkean) after he has an affair
with Bart (Harry Hamlin)
discovers that he's really a

   

"m<£‘ “-
jj /

Kate: Jackson portrays

executive, who discovers that
she's strong enough to let go of
Zack and create a new life for
herself. Jackson's performance
will probably surprise a lot of
people who thought of her as
either one of Charlie's Angels or
Jill Danko, the character she
played for four years on The
Rbokies. As Claire,» she's finally
given the chance to show her
stuff——she covers a wide range
of emotions in Making Love,
from anger, to frustration, to
confusion, to acceptance and a
million others in between. Kiss
Sabrina good’-bye.

"As soon as people see you
doing a different role, and if
you are believable, I think
they're able to accept you for
what you're doing now and not
what you were doing before,"
Jackson observes. "Audiences

HI;

.will allow you to change.”

Considering that Claire
Elliot is so drastically different
from any other role she's
played, how did Jackson go
about preparing for it?

"The first thing I do when
I'm portraying any character is
try to find her (the character's)
sense of humor; then, I find out
what's important to her—who
she is—who she loves. For
Claire, I didn't really do any
specific research, because they
might have colored the

reactions -she was having to

everything."

As far as Jackson's acting
technique goes, she simply
says,"I just listen; I have a
knowledge of the character, so
I never say to myself,'you're
supposed to be feeling this
emotion’ and then put an
expression on my facegl just
listen—like the character
does—with my heart and ears."

"Arthur.Hiller (Making _

Love's director)’ is sowonderful
to work with. Naturally, he
helped me a lot and I got a lot
from him, but he's not just an
actor's director; he knows all
sorts of technical aspects of
working with the cameras, the
talks to the
cinematographer all the time.
Lights, cameras and acting are
all equally important with
him." '

"When I first opened the

script, for example, and saw ' 
"the tight - camera

sequence
shots (the film constantly goes
back to close—ups of Hamlin
and Jackson reminiscing about
their relationship ’-with
Ontkean), I said 'Oh my God!’
because when you're that close
to the camera, you can't lie. But
Arthur would just ask me
questions, so what you see are
my answers to those
questions."

With so many actors opting

for the stage nowadays,‘ on-eﬂ‘

isn't surprised that Jackson
recently did ajplay, also.

"Yes, I just did Key Exchange
here in L. A. It was very
exciting and a real challenge,
but I discovered that I like film
better. The film experience, for
me is more exciting. I was so
nervous when I did the play—
having that audience sitting
there was scary. Cinema is so
much more intimate, each
movement means
more; it's so much more
economical——the face, the eyes,
have so much more emphasis."

Does Making Love parallel
Jackson's personal life in any
way?

"Well, in a way, yes it
certainly does. Like at the end
when Claire has remarried and
sees Zack atthe funeral of their
old friend, Winnie; in a way

she's gotten over him, but she‘

still feels something for him
because he was her first big
love. And that's true in my life,

‘too. Your first love. is so great, J

Michael Ontkean looks like
the successful young doc_tor he
plays in Making Love. Dressed in
casual, but expensive clothes,
he often runs a hand through
his wavy, brown tresses as he
talks about his role in the
picture.
I ”I didn't do a lot of
preparation going into this
role—no game plan, really. I
screened a lot of movies
beforehand and read a few
things that I thought might
help me understand the
character better. What I really
lgﬁlvvanted to do was get to the
character's split——his dilem-
ma-—so, what I really did was

anything. I did my first picture
when I was eight, and worked
pretty steadily until I was_13——
that's when I quit to
concentrate on hockey.
(Ontkean played for a Toronto
' Maple Leafs’ farm club during
high school, and also for semi-
pro ‘teams in Quebec and
British Columbia.) but I went

kind of strange. This" studio
(20th Century Fox, where the
‘L.._,lti*terview took place) is like a
ghost town at night, so I stayed
here after the shooting was
over. It gave me the feeling
that Zack had—of being alone,
isolated. I also wanted to get a
feel for a different sexuality,
but, instead of going out to gay
bars, which really would have
been out of character for‘ Zack,
I, uh...this might sound
~ strange, but I remained celibate
for awhile. It took me into a
‘wj.a’hole other dimension. But it
only lasted three and a half
month," he exclaims,
somewhat sheepishly.
Ontkean, like Jackson, is a
familiar face to T.V. audiences,
and he's also been featured in
such films as Slapshot and Willie
'n Phil. But he's been in the
acting business for a long time.
”I come from a family of
actors. Both of my parents
 actors——we moved around
a lot because of it——so I was
exposed» to it at an early age,
not that they made me do it;
they never pushed me intolit or

back to acting in college.” ‘

A lot of actors might shy
away from portraying a gay,
but this aspect didn't bother
Ontkean.

”I try never to make
judgements about ' the
character. The only thing Iwas
worried about were my love
scenes with Harry's character,

especially the first one. I was

explained. \

white chablis, showing no
signs of being nervous about

realize that there are things
-that are important to me and
that I have responsibilities that
I can't turn my back on."
(Hamlin lives with actress
Ursula Andress. and they have
a two year-old son named
Dimitri.)

As an actor whose roles
haven't had all that much meat
to them (heclaims to be really
embarassed about ‘several of
his roles and refers to Clash Of
The Titans as a beefcake
monster movie’), he's very
happy about his part in Making
Love.

”This film has the chance to
change a lot of attitudes. We
' made an effort not to portray
stereotypes in ‘it; gays are often
thought of as flamboyant——the
types who make good copy. By
portraying them as people with
successful careers and stable
relationships we can, hopefully
change the way that a lot of
people see the homosexual
world. I think it's an important
film and I'm proud of it.”.

CHICISTARPOINT
February 5, 1982
Syria Mosque

By TODD ERKEL

The flag flies at half-mast
outside C-9, Schenley Hall.
Inside, grimaces abound, eve-
ryone is wearing mirror shades,
and negotiations continue in the
hopes of acquiring a downtrod-
den New Yorker named Dan-
gerfield as a patron saint. In the ’
face‘ of rampant apathy, the
P.P.C.’s concert committee
should seriously consider
sub-mission.

Their latest attempt at bring-
ing a concert (Chic) and a crowd
(preferably human) together in
the same vicinity has failed.
Why? The blame certainly
doesn't go to P.P.C. and Co., for
they made a commendable
effort at promoting the Chic
concert. The reasons behind the
Tmoor attendance are surely far

too blase for these pages. In
their place you get a recap of
what, chances are, you missed.

Starpoint, the opener for Fri-
day's show, provided a pleasant
surprise. The six member group
allowed the crowd to settle back

, and relax before slowly picking
up the ‘pace, bringing the
audience with them. Leading
lady Renee Diggs looked right at
home among the bright lights,
gracing the stage with a
smoothness that filled her
moves and her voice. By the end

." if their set, Starpoint‘ had
prepped the crowd like a master
chef V

Following a short intermis-
sion, Chic hit the Mosque (stage
and began to provide the heat———
wall to wall heat! Vocalist Alfa
Anderson and Luci Martin took

' center stage with guitarist Nile
Rodgers and bassist Bernard
Edwards boxing in the ends. Fil-
ling the gaps were drums, a
horn section, and backing
vocals.

The first notes of ”Stage
Fright” cracked with a precision

t no doubt split the smoke
particles filling the air. The
sound was crisp and delicately
mixed, allowing Chic’s complex
rhythmic mutations to be fully
enjoyed.

That Friday's show was
Chic’s first night out in a year
and a half probably would have
gone unnoticed if Edwards
hadn't made the point. ”I Want
Your Love” followed, the first
of Chic’s many top 40 hits to be
had that night. Next came ”So
Fine" and ”Burn Hard,” back-to-

ack mega-jams that quickly
- . . aid to rest any doubts regarding
Edwards’ and Rodgers’ place
among the elite of their craft.
The duo did give and go's with
the spotlight, staging a clinic on
blistering guitar, driving bass,
and the use of rhythms in bring-
ing down the house!

"Freak Out” brought eve-
ryone on their feet and a medley
of Rodgers’ and Edwards’ pro-
duced hits set the place in
motion. The group's versatility
xshone through on covers of

wah Harry's ”Backfired,”

Diana Ross’ ’’I’m Coming Out,”
and Sister Sledge’s ”We Are
Family.” ”Good Times” and The
Sugar Hill Cang’s ”Rapper
Delight” brought the show to a

2.. ,

 

frenzied climax.

So it went; no encore. Chic
gave a great concert but it didn't
justify $10 a head. Too little of
anything is no good and forty or
so minutes ‘is far too little. But
then again, life isn't fair, times

V are bad, white people can't
dance, and the P.P.C. are bring-
ing The Outlaws to town on—
February 25. The Mosque will
probably be packed because
Pittsburgh has more people
with their wallets chained to
their jeans than any city in the
country. So take my advice and

-go see The Outlaws; You'll get
two hours of mind—wrenching

schlock and droll and all the

encores you can eat.

OZZY OSBOURNEI
STARFIGHTERS
Civic Arena
February 2, 1982

By GEORGE HOLZER

”Ozzy.” This seemed to be the
chant for the evening. ”Oz’zy!”
The crowd was mostly com-
posed of wasted young adults
and drunken teenagers.
”OZZY! OZZY!" They had
merged to form a throng of
Heavy Metal enthusiasts.
”OZZY! OZZY! OZZY!”
Maybe it was idol worship?
"OZZY!”

Starfighters, the opening act,
didn't have a chance. A very
biased crowd lasted through
three tunes, then decidedthey
had had enough. This new Eng-
lish heavy metal leather quintet
has one claim to fame: rhythm

 

"guitarist is the nephew of
AC/DC’s Youngs (Angus and
Malcolm). But their music cer-
tainly isn't a claim to fame. It
stinks. Starfighters returned
for an encore, more for their
own sake than that of the
crowd; the crowd wouldn't have
minded if they had never
showed up at all.

Ozzy’s entrance brought up a
roar from the crowd; he
appeared on stage as if by magic
and carried a large cross around
much to the audience's appro-
val. He set down the cross and
ran to center stage, reached for
his mike, and dropped it. After
that, his show was flawless.

A twelve-song set made the
show very entertaining. Most
of the tunes were from Ozzy
Osbourne albums, but the last
two were from the days of Black
Sabbath. ”Mr. Crowley,”
”Crazy Train,” ”Suicide Solu-

tion,” ”I Don't Know,” and ’’Fly-

ing High Ag-ain” were the Ozzy
cuts the audience appreciated.
most; the Sabbath tunes were
”Iron Man” and ”Children of the
Grave.”

The one—song encore was
another Sabbath song, ”Para—
noid.” This was done better
than the Sabs did it in their
November arena date, like it
was custom—made for Ozzy.

The Blizzard, as Ozzy’s band
is known, was really solid; no
flaws could be found. Randy
Rhoads cut through the back-
ground rhythm with pointed
guitar licks, drummer Lee Kers-
lake performed an impressive
solo, Bob Daisley, the bassist,
and the keyboard man filled out
Ozzy’s sound team.

The ‘stage was the most lavish
I have ever seen in rock and roll,
and the special effects were too
many to name. A great stage
show had been promised by the
media, and the evening saw
more than a great concert come
to pass; it witnessed rock
theater at its best

Ozzy gave a good perfor-
mance and proved that he could
keep his ‘following without
engaging in sub-human antics
such as biting off heads of birds
and bats, even if they are only
press hypes. His music and
stage show alone would keep
the chants going—”OZZY!
OZZY! OZZY! OZZY!”

This is one of those albums
that causes a lot of aggravation.
On one hand, most of it is scin-

rest of it reeks of syrupy sweet-
ness and bears the ill mark of
pop redundancy (you'll swear

YOU WANT IT YOU GOT IT
‘Bryan Adams
A&M

Now wait a minute...I’m sup-
posed to believe that this Sting
/James Dean clone with the»KY
in his hair and the avant-Trash
and Vaudeville wardrobe (well
almost) can even attempt to
rock—n-roll...Well just keep
repeating, ”It’s only a Lynn
Goldsmith cover, it's only a
Lynn Goldsmith...”

Youfwant It You Got It is Bryan

' Adams’ American debut album,
V but by no means is he an ano-

nymous figure en el mundo.
Adams is well received by the
Vancouver club curcuit (his
home turf) and is in the process
of amassing a large following in
both England and the U.S.

You Want It You Got It is not an
exceptional album; it is not,
however, one to be totally
ignored. Bob CIearmountain’s

” “production is slick, resulting in a

strong backbeat and a pumped
up sound. Adams’ songs are
saucy and taunting to a fault,

however. His ”wax persona" of
bravado and streetwise

C. machismo gets to be a little ho-

hum after about side one and
lies as one of the main weak-
nesses of the album.

Adams’ music and voice seem
to bear a resemblance to the old
Eric CarmenlRaspberries sound
which immediately forces a
resurrection of that catch—all
classifier——pop music (is every-
one OK.7). Without using that
evil, prejudicial adjective I will

I go on to say that Adams" music

has a better kick to it, but lacks
the magic of the ’Berries tunes.

Well, maybe Bryan Adams

"ain't no "crackerjack” but this

album ‘is not bad. So if you
already have the Go,-Go's album
and you miss the Raspberries or
even the Babys there's always
You Want it You Got It. You might

want it.

FRANK DIGIACOMO

 

fantastic? Well, this happened
to me after meeting a girl from
Holland who insisted that I buy

this ,album. I had A hrhe name

name before butpl never paid
much heed...until now!
The album Architecture an

Morality is the latest by a band. I

called Orchestral Manoeuvres
In The Dark, a band whose
name depicts its sound. The
album is produced as though the

.songs were various symphonic

movements with the tempo
quickening and slowing with
each new mood of the songs.

The words themselves tell the
tale of a young girl who leaves
her home, friends, and special
admirer to spend her days with
the man of her dreams. But her
heart is shattered and she is left
astray -(/as often is the case) by
her lover; yet, she says, "no
excuses, my feelings still remain."
Eventually, she goes back home
to find the love she so dearly
came to value.

The album is very touching
and I would recommend it
strongly to anyone who values

I well—written sogs ad highly

coordinated music to match.

NIGHTMARE CITY

The Alleycats

Time Coast Records/Faulty _
The debut album from The

Alleycats leaves a lot of ques-

tions. unanswered. Is this new

music? (sex, drugs, and punk’n

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  

roll?) Does anyone involved
with this record know it's 1982?
After listening to Nightmare City,
you may well wonder.

The Alleycats consist of John
McCarthy-drums, Dianne
Chai-basslvocals, and Randy
Stodola-guitar/lead vocals. Sto-
dala, who wrote all the songs
and also produced the album,
sings something like a strung-
out Bob Dylan played at various
speeds. (Especially on the ‘bal-
lad,’ ”King of The Street
Fights/’)

However, the lyrics are the
real focus of Nightmare City.
They're pretty heavy; angels of
doom, junkies, lobotomized
morons and dreams that dance
naked in the night. (The
entirety of the album, as the
title implies, takes place in the
dark.) But of all the hip, bohem-
ian underground references
here, myfavorite has got to be
”phantasmagoric world,” (as in,
Baby, you're so phantasmagoric/’)

V Try that one on your valentine.

So if life doesn't throw
enough bad dreams your way,
go out and buy Nightmare City. As
the title track suggests, you'll
"think that it's over/But it's hardly
begun." _

know"...does controversy sell
records better than the music
it's set to? The answer is proba-
bly yes but for Josie Cotton only
time will tell.

”Johnny Are You Queer" is at
the moment the hottest selling
single in L.A. andmost of sur-

rounding California (e.g., San »

Francisco). It is also causing the
greatest amount of dissonance
among those conservative nin-
nies who subscribe to such lines
of ”thinking” as say the moral
majority (ooh) or ”American
puritan ethics" (aah) since Rod
Stewart's ”Tonight's The
Night." The song has been
banned from numerous radio

4 stations across the US. but is 5

also being overplayed on a
greater number of stations
(including RCT). ,

The song itself is irresistible.
It has more hooks than a fishing
lure and immediately brings to
mind those great all-girl groups
of the fifties, sixties, and eight-
ies Iike the Ronettes, the
Orlons, the Shirelles, and the
Go—Gos. In fact, the song, which
was written by L.A. producers
Bobby and Larson Paine, was
originally a part of the Go—Gos
live repertoire (when they were
managed by the Paines) but was
dropped when they went on to
better things.

So now Josie Cotton has dibs
on the tune and it has undoubt-
edly launched her career as a
”rock-n_-roll singer." Sup-
posedly she has already sold out
the Roxy and is, at the moment
recording her debut album.
Josie Cotton has apparently
caught the crest of a wave that’-s
putting the bomp back into
bomp shu-bomp and the do wah
diddy and is making ”Johnny
Are You Queer” so popular.

However, just as the fifties
and ‘the sixties brought the
Shangri-Las and Martha and
The Vandellas it also brought
the onslaughtgof one—hit wond-
ers tht have-left a single song
unfulfilled contr t.
