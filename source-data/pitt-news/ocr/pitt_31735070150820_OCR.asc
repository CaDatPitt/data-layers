In memoriam:
Donald Egolf‘

Brett Wilson
For The Pitt News

As professorjohn Gareis put it, the
Department of Communications has

A lost its “backbone and stabilizer”

with the death of professor Donald
B. Egolf. Egolfpassed away on Sun-
day Feb. 3, at the age of 75.

“He was just a go—getter  He
was always one step ahead of every-
one else. He just knew that to make
a great department, someone had
to take the reins,” Gareis said. “That
was who he was and what he did for

‘ this school.”

Not only was Egolf a longtime
professor at Pitt, but he also received
his bachelor’s degree, master’s de-
gree and Ph.D. at the University.

“He built himself here,” Gareis
said. “Not only that, he became who
he is through Pitt, and the Depart-
ment of Communications is what it
is today because of Dr. Egol .”

Professor Gordon Mitchell, the
Department of Communications

chairman, spoke onpbehalf of the

entire department.

“We are deeply saddened at the
passing of Dr. Donald B. Egol ,” he
said in an email. “Don was a cher-
ished member of our faculty for
many years, serving the Department
of Communications in myriad ways.”

Egolf has published many works
in his time in the ﬁeld of communi-
cations, including one just last year
titled “Human Communication and
the Brain.” He taught many classes
over the years on both the under-
graduate and graduate levels, but
as Gareis said, he was most known

for his nonverbal and small-group -

communication courses.
Egolf also chaired 24 disserta-

Pitt police
adhere to
Clery Act

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

One free-speech advocacy group
is using this month to raise aware-
ness for its claim that many uni-
versity police departments fail
to adhere to laws regarding the
report of crime on campuses. But
when it comes to compliance with
the Clery Act, Pitt passes the test.

The Student Press Law Center
believes that many universities
don’t properly comply with all as-
pects of the Clery Act, and center

leaders have asked students on

campuses across the United States
to test this theory.

Under the C_lery Act, a statute
that Congress passed in 1990, uni-
versities must inform the general
public about the crimes that occur
on their campuses, their prop-
erty or in contiguous and adja-
cent areas. Universities must also
compileanntial reports on such
crimes that include statistics for
the previous three years. Univer-
sities that .violate the Clery Act
face ﬁnes ranging from $27,500
to $35,000.

Abigail Boyer, the director of
communications for the Wayne,
Pa.—based Clery Center, a non-
proﬁt organization that works to
prevent crime on campuses, ex-
plained that thejeanne Clery Dis-
closure of ‘Campus Security Policy
and Campus Crime Statistics Act
has its origins in one family’s grief.

She said Connie and How-
ard Clery began to lobby for the
disclosure of reports of violent

tions to completion throughout his career — a
feat Gareis said was “quite a magniﬁcent ac-
complishment.” That made him the most active
of all the department’s graduate advisers. in
2002, he was given the top teaching honor at
Pitt, receiving the ChanceHor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award.“Don chaired the department
for several years and tirelessly served on nu-

’ - merous departmentalcommittees throughthe

years,” Mitchell said.

Despite his academic workload, Egolf al-
ways focused on individual student achieve-
ment.

Formerstudent Darmy Schimizzi, a 2010
graduate, described Egolfas a ﬁgurehead in
the department. ’ A

“It was like a rite of passage in the com-
munications department to have him as your
professor, and every student who had him had
a different experience, because he focused
on students individually, not just as a class,”
Schimizzi said. a

Senior communications and rhetoric major
Evan Terwilliger recalled Egolf’s playful-nauire.

“One time, I remember walking down.the

halland looking over and seeing Dr. Egolfdoing V
' a wheelie in his wheelchair,” he said.
Gareis said he would characterize Egolf as‘

a “Renaissance man in the truest sense of the
word.” He was renowned for knowing some-
thing about nearly every topic.

“Whether it was Broadway or religion, he
knew it,” he said. ' ‘

While no oﬁicial armouncement has been
made about a potential memorial service to

.honor Egolf, 'Gareis said he expects that one

will be held.

“I, as well as many others, would like
something organized for him at Heinz Cha-
pel, because he was so inﬂuential to so many
people over the years,” Gareis said. “I believe
that many people would attend to honor his
memory.” I '

crimeson college campuses in 1987, the _

year after their daughter, for whom the fed-
eral statute is named, was raped and mur-
dered in her Lehigh University dorm room.
The Clerys learned that the university had
not disclosed a rise in violent crimein its

. area prior to the attack on their daughter.

“That wasn’t unusual at the time,” Boyer
said. “Her institution was not unique.”

The statute, which applies to all institu—
tions of higher education‘ that participate in
federal student-aid programs, requiresthat
schools publish annual reports that contain
ﬁgures about the number of crimes that
have taken place on campus over the previ-
ous three years. The reports must include
not only crimes reported directly.to the
campus police, but also any crimes reported
to campus security authorities, who include
athletic oflicials and administrators.

Every year, the Department of Educa-
tion checks certain universities’ compli-
ance with the statute. However, the SPLC

has expressed concerns about universities’ C

compliance with the act.

To prove its theory of university non-
compliance with the Clery Act, SPLC leaders
encouraged university students around the
country to check whether their schools
complied with a single aspect of the act.

Under the statute, universities must
make a log of crimes committed on their
campuses and adjacent areas over the
previous two months available for public
viewing during normal business hours. The
logs must also include crimes that occur on
university property. ' ' .

SPLC leaders urged students to enter
their campus police department during the
days between Feb. 4 and 8 and between Feb.
11 and 15 and ask to see these logs.

When ‘reporters for The Pitt News en-

tered the University police department at

different times on three consecutive busi-
ne"s_s.days, employees allowed the reporters
to see the logs.‘

As of Monday morning, Frank LoMonte,
the executive director of the SPLC did not
have information about whether students at
other universities found their institutions
in compliance with the law. C

’ Jane Glickman, a press officer for the
Department of Education, declined to com-
ment on LoMonte’s allegations that many
universities fail to comply with the Clery
Act. However, she did explain in an email.
that-the Department of Education’s ofﬁce
of Federal Student Aid audits a number of
schools annually for their compliance with

e the Clery Act.

The audits evaluate universities’ records
to determine whether they accurately re-
port all crimes in their annual reports. They
must release the annual report by Oct. 1 of
the following calendar year, she said.

Glickman added that the Department
of Education may audit a university in re-

sponse to a complaint. about the institu— l

ti_on’s compliance, in response to a"‘media
event” that reveals a previously undisclosed
crime or through a selection process that

' coincides with state-level reviews.

The FSA’s website lists ﬁve Clery-pro-
gram reviews conducted in 2012 and 16
conducted in 2011. Four of the ﬁve program

reports in 2012 list at least one citation, ~

as do 15 of the 16 that the FSA conducted
in 2011. However, some of the citations
listed include failure to publish informa-
tion on the school’s security policy, another
requirement of the Clery Act, rather than
inaccurate reporting of crime statistics.
Glickman emphasized that the Depart-
ment of Education looks into any case
where it believes that a school might not
have reported a crime accurately. '
LoMonte said that while many campus
police departments maintain proper re-
cords, he suspects some university officials
receive reports of crimes from students but

do not share these reports with the police.
As one example of questionable ﬁg-

ures, LoMonte said that some universities ’

with around 20,000 students report only
one sexual assault annually. He expressed
doubts that such a low number was statisti-
cally likely.

“Our strong impression is that crimes

V handled through disciplinary channels are ‘

going unreported,” he said. _

LoMonte acknowledged that he did not
have statistical data that proved his suspi-
cions about underreporting. However, he

hoped that the efforts of the SPLC could. -

serve as one means to check compliance.
When Kathleen Schreiber, the regional
commander of the University of Pittsburgh

_Police, learned that her department com-
plied with the statute’s requirement that it 1

make its crime logs available to the public,
she did not seem surprised. ’ ,
Schreiber said that the police depart-

ment’s goals included maintaining accurate .
records and issuing crime alerts on unre- "

solved crimes that occur on or adjacent to
the campuses. When a violent crime such as
a robbery occurs in this area, she said, the
department posts crime alerts that include

‘information about the incident on campus

buildings, distributes them to University
ofﬁcials and posts the crime alert on its
website. A ‘

Schreiber compiles the annual report
for the Pittsburgh campus. She said that
personnel from the department check in-
cident reports to make sure that they enter
all crimes about which they receive reports
into the logs for public viewing.

Schreiber could not understand why
universities would misrepresent crimes
that could affect students.

“Our goal as a police department is to
respond to incidents,” she said. “But our
goal is also to prevent them.” I

ANNALS OF DECADENCE ‘ 6 ,
Fear and loathing on Semple

Street: Observations and parting

shots in South Oakland

John Hasley
Columnist

-In many ways, this column is the

product of egregious mastications
ofwhatreally happened. The author
makes these choices deliberately, as
he believes they present a "clearer
picture than the mundane truth
ever could.

I have planned my observations
for the period of time between the
hours of midnight and 3 a.m. on Sun-
day Feb. 10, as these will give us the
best snapshot or cross section of they
contentl am seeking to describe. A
disguise is unnecessary; both the
cover of nightfall and the fact that I
am surrounded by college students
instead of the quiche—eating, opera-

- spectacle—using, pinkie-out, espres-

so-sipping denizens of Shadyside
renders any need to masquerade as
an insider immaterial. These are my
people. I am ready to go.

Tonight brings us to the un-
seemly underbelly of our fair ‘cam-
pus: South Oakland. Having once
lived here for a year, the author-is
now offering his ﬁnal and deﬁni-

tive thoughts on what exactly the
signiﬁcance of this neighborhood
is and why it is that people choose
to live here.

Graciously ceded temporary use
of the porch on which the author

— and his former roommates used to

drink beer and devour Giant Eagle
rotisserie chickens whole (which
is attached to the house in which
the ‘author remains to this day the
undisputed Mario Kart champion;

’ Yoshi fo’ life), the author begins

his observations. Though research
starts here, it will likely end in the
heart of what is culturally —_ al-
beit not geographically -— deemed
South Oakland, aka the two blocks of
Semple, Meyran and Atwood streets
between Forbes and Bates.

12:15 a'.rn.: On the porch of 317
Semple St.

The cacophony of the streets
rises gracefully and encloses the
surrounding precincts in a gentle
symphony of the night prowlers,
those seekers of sensory stimulation
fora mere $5 entry fee. Sounds of
stiletto heels, now at'a trot, now at
a canter, loud peals and confronta-

 

- tions pullulate from the surrounding

night air. This, I submit, is that most

' righteous of stuff. This is the deﬁni-

tive form of college life.

The erstwhile host venue of
SempleFest, that late Pitt tradi-
tion wherein students would join
together to celebrate the conclu-
sion of the academic year, is dark,
yet teeming with life. SempleFest
(which really only existed up until
the spring of 2008; more to say on
this below) was a tumultuous affair
duringwhich memories were born,
legends were kindled and enough
cheap beer to ﬂoat Moses clear down
to Pharaoh’s palacewas consumed. It
was a veritable bacchanal of college
students that no amount of noise
violations or open-container cita-
tions could quell.

' But these were the stately days of
yore, before our mayor graciously
put us on double secret probation,
thereby eliminating any chance of
SempleFest regaining its former
glory. Still, South Oakland proceeds
for the cause, unfazed by whatever
Lilliputian ﬁst shaking may emerge

from the mayor’s office. A wiser man than

s.«myself once countered such accusations by

inquiring as to the mayor’s after—hours use
of the city’s resources. No doubt such an ac-
count would ﬁll many volumes of the Annals

_ of Decadence. ‘ -

The adornments of each porch tell a story.

~ K Some are ﬁlthy and uncared for, while others
are ﬁlthy but clearly settled in such a way as

to make a clear statement about the modes of
living in this neighborhood. Every beer can
lying idly on a table or rattling down onto the
floor is placed with just enough casual elegance
as to tell us that its drinker threw it down in a
ﬁt of exultation, a celebration of the seeming
endlessness of college and youth, conﬁdent in
the sweet and blissful ignorance of the “real
world’? that we cultivate here as undergradu-
ates. Tomorrlow and tomorrow and tomorrow
seldom, if ever,.come. I ‘ » ‘

To have plastic cups and empty beer cans

‘adorning one’s porch is to have a certain social
cachethere, a medal of merit that must be -
displayed to the environs at large. Eventually, '
they will drift down into the street and become"

part of the perpetual mantle of empty beer
cans and broken glass that covers all of South
Oakland on every Friday, Saturday and Sunday
morning, reaching low tide by around Thurs-
day afternoon, only to then be thoroughly

4 replenished over the next 72 hours. Future

generations may well be left with little else
in terms of anthropological evidence when

, trying to reconstruct the wonderful squalor

of this neighborhood.

, 1i13 a.m.: Down to Bates Street

Despite the mayoral constraints, South
Oakland still plays host to the hard-partying
crowd of Pitt. No one moves here to get away
from the helter—skelter of your little—if—any-
regard—held—for-“quiet—hours”-and—less-for-
the—RA freshman dorm. Rather, we move here
to embrace it, to claim it as our own and put
our deﬁnitive mark on it. _ ’

Though the more permanently rooted in-

,habitants of South Oakland may well claw at .

their ears with an animalistic passion when
they hear me say it, one cannot help but feel

that the streets and houses of S emple, Atwood, V
etc., are ours in a way that the University dor— .

mitories were not. While dorms provide a good

environment for starters,‘it is hard to escape

' the feeling that we are under the watchful eye

of Big Brother. An exodus into the surrounding
neighborhoods is a liberating opportunity to
really make a claim of self—reliance' and identity
with one’s physical surroundings.

, Here resides the resulting quotidian of
the masses, the ruck of humanity, the great
unwashed, who are nonetheless washed in
a brimming tide of Natty Light, cheap vodka
and sundry decibels of crappy pop music. Such
are the rites of baptism into the real modes of
college life, wherein rowdiness and depreda—

tion are to be celebrated, not censured. We’ll ‘

brook no early—to—bed nonsense here; this is
God’s country. ’ "

All the while, the true beauty of this neigh-
borhood is in its transience, for we are here
today and gone tomorrow. Try as we might,
college lasts for only a brief period, and our
residence in South Oakland is an even briefer
one than that. As such, it warrants both an
unyielding assertion of one’s newfound au-
tonomy and an unremitting effort to stop up
time in a bottle and displace with blinkered,
yet rapacious, vigor the thought of ever leaving
our beloved streets. ‘

Though we have but a little space in which
to strut and fret our hour, one cannot chide

 P am is a staple of S  Farha Ali 1 Fr  News

South Oakland for lack of trying. Despite the I

cold weather tonight, whole-platoons of young

ladies and gentlemen bustle on by, wending

from porch to porch in search of tonight’s
hot spot. . ,

It looks as though many people are making
their way down toward Melba Street. But that’s
deep South Oakland (below Bates), and,jour-
nalistic integritybe damned, the author values
his life more so than reporting on the unspeak-
ably salacious behavior which no doubt occurs
down there. Something like Dante’s seventh

' circle of hell might come close, but I’ll make

no further attempt at ediﬁcation.

- \

2:23 a.m.: Over to Atwood Street

What is it that drives certain apartments
and houses to self—apply titles? The Brothel,
The Bivoua_c, The Deli, The Cabana, The Boat,
plus numerous others havescome and gone
throughout the past few years in this seedy
neighborhood.,Some names are overtly in-
decent, some play more toward the coy side,
some will never make sense to anyone besides
the residents therein. This last type will likely

die out soon after the apartment is vacated by '

that .year’s‘residents. Butthere are some that
live on, and some at which any freshman worth
her salt in the social scene of South Oakland

should be able to "say that she has successfully
partied by the end of her freshman year.

The ones thatwill live on are a part of some-
thing special, something into which students
can invest their legacies and their traditions, so

— that future South Oaklanders may know that

they live in the shadows of greatness, that they
are in some ways simply further articulations

- of those who have come before. What students

achieve, or at least attempt to achieve, in ap-
plying names to their apartments, is nothing
short of immortality. It’s a tall order, but, then
again, we’re all immortal at this stage of our
lives, so why not shoot for the moon?

Stumblingfreshmen cling to each other
like chains of red plastic monkeys and police
cruisers glide casually by. It’s getting chilly,so
I turn back up toward Forbes Avenue.

3 a.m.: Some_where close to Sorrento’s; de-
tails not important ,

The choice of a'weekend in February was
not perhaps the wisestfdecision: My hands are

now completely frozen; Perhaps I should stop y

in at the nearest kegger for a pint to warm the

spirits. While my editorial desk may well disap— ,

prove of working under" theinﬂuence, I kow-

tow to no such scruple. Unfortunately there do '

not seem to be any parties still in full force. A
few dreary-"eyed boys slink nonchalantly out
of a door across the street, clearly unsuccessﬁil
in tonight’s pursuit. Buck up soldiers, for you
are young, and you’ll live to die another day.
But the sounds! Offin the distance, echo-
ing throughout the haunts of Atwood Street
and Oakland Avenue, rebounding over Bates
Street, the great divider, ﬁlling South Oakland
with a wonderful sense that it is alive and exu-

. berant, lifting its voice high in euphoria to its

own praise. Cries and yells and roars reverber-
ate from the dark hollows. After the hour of

. midnight, one may well be able to track the

sound of some form of shouting oryelling in
South Oakland, unbroken and clear till around
3:30 a.m., accelerating in something like an
inﬁnite feedback loop, initially gaining in force
and latitude, peaking" in wholesale crescendo

» ' after the barslet out, and ﬁnally dying out after

avigorous exercise, after which the adrenaline

ﬁnally ﬂags, and the brave students mosey on -

back to their beds to recharge their batteries
(among other activities). I have heard them

singing each to each, and I must say I whole— .

heartedly approve of the tune: “’Til graduation
wakes us and we drown.” I » . »

Keri Russell (above) acts in “Dark Skies,” a new paranormal thriller

produced by Jason Blum. l‘~flCTC..:1mpus

‘Dork S\<'\es'

 

Sam Botarskll

Jason Blum understands
horror, and he’s worked
to make what he thinks
is his scariest film to
date. _ .
Blum,the producer of
popular films such as
‘Paranormal Activity”
and “Insidious,” recently

  produced “Dark Skies,” a I

new paranormal thriller
set to be released on
Feb.22. ’

In a conference call
with reporters, Blum
discussed thehorror
genre, how he produces
his films and the movie

‘that scared him most as
 a child. ,

Question: “Dark Skies” appears
to be in the vein of an alien
body-snatcher type movie as
opposed to the haunted house

.  What attracted you to “Dark-
‘ Skies” and working within this

kind of horror subgenre?

Staii Wlllel

 

Jason Blum: I really love kind of ordinary
situations where you throw a dark force
of some kind in the mix and chaos ensues.
And so in that way, I feel like “Dark Skies”
is definitely one of the scariest movies
we’ve made. They’re definitely a different
kind of scares, bu‘t~'the emotional journeys
of the characters  in all the movies are
similar.

Q: Why have you decided to
work with [director] Scott
Stewart on “Dark Skies”?

]B: I saw “Legion” and I really liked it a
lot, and Iigot in touch with his agent and
had a meeting with him, and I explained
our model. We work in a very speciﬁc
model, and I asked him if he had any
stories that would fit our model. What
he pitched me and what the movie is are

‘very close.

Q: Do you, yourself, have a per-
sonal belief in the paranormal?

_]B: I think there’s something morelout
there in the world than all of us are aware

Q&A D 10

COLUMN - -

Jeff Ihaza
Staff Writer

Perched above the Gardiner Expressway, which
carries drivers into downtown Toronto, is a bill-
board. In gold letters written over a slick black
backdrop reads a minimalist representation of
Toronto—bom rapper Aubrey “Drake” Graham’s
latest mantra: “Started From The Bottom.”

The symbolism is ﬁtting, as the billboard
hovers above the city displaying a declaration
repeated over and over in the rapper’s latest
single of the same name.

In the days leading up to the song’s release,
Drake tweeted a photo of the newly minted
billboard, and of course, as is custom with
everything on the Internet, dissent brewed.

The crux of the argument presented by dis-

senters (myself included) is that Drake’s ascent -

to his current near—untouchable stature in the
hip—hop community is hardly one that started

' from the bottom. It didn’t take longfor naysay-

ers to point out the rapper’s beginnings on the
teen drama “Degrassi: The Next Generation”
in which he playedjimmy Brooks, a basketball
star whose career is cut short after he is shot
andsubsequently disabled.

If Drake’s ﬁctional character were his real
story, his latest move might be better received.

In rap music, there seems to be an expecta-
tion of earning one’s stripes, street cred of some
sort that says" you’ve suffered solmuch in life
that you deserve to be a rapper. It’s the reason

lines fromjay-Z such as “If you escaped what .

I escaped, you’d be in Paris getting f"‘**ed up
too,” resonate, because on some level listeners

want to vicariously live through these artists’

' struggles. .

I . Drake presents a peculiar position, because
nothing about his “struggle” is terribly compel-
ling. He admits to never having to tote a gun
or sell drugs at a young age. '

‘ In the music video for “Started From The
Bottomf’ we’re given a glimpse into Drakggs

past, playing little league soccer, 

minimum-wage job and later being promotéd
to manager. Drake’s early appeal came from
these facts: He was the guy you worked 
overnight at the grocery store the sumrriér
before college, who’d let you go home early
and give you copies of his mixtape. We all know
aDrake. - V

It’s the same appeal that Mac Miller and
Macklemore have. They rap for a demographic

Middle-class rappers find their-voice  hip-hopigfenre

that is far removed from the crippling pov-

‘ erty in this country, or they rap for average

people. The problem with Drakefs latest foray
is that he’s trying to convince us there is value
in the average struggle. It’s Lena Dunham and
“Girls” that convince the country the problems
of wealthy, white 20-somethings is television-

w0rthy-- * "   l 7
' V ‘.‘Whether or not Drake — or Lena Dunham
for that matter — can sufficiently make this
case is important. For all of my Drake hate, I’ll
admit_that the song is nice, the video features
a feel-good party that we can all relate to on
some level, hitting on cute girls at the cash
register and getting shut down. It’s a ﬁin story.
It seems that at the bottom of the hate for

cooking and kept on doing it,” Bodnar said.

The langos, a type of fried bread made from
risen dough and dusted with garlic salt, is usu-
ally served first. This is often followed up by
a soup of some variety -— usually Bodnar’s
specialty, chicken vegetable peasant soup.
Haluska, a common Eastern European dish
typically attributed to the Polish culture, is
a guest favorite in the dining room. Bodnar
balances ﬂavor and texture to give his haluska
a Hungarian identity.

If not the best dish served atjozsa Corner,
the Hungarian goulash is at least the most
memorable. Bodnar’s version of goulash
consists of beef chunks mixed with ﬂavorful
sauerkraut and topped by a generous gob of
sour cream, which guests often like to mix in
evenly with the rest of the dish.

The last dish is usually an assortment of
fruit and chocolate crepes. The food Bodnar
serves is almost solely carbs and proteins, so
guests rarely leave on an empty stomach.

At Jozsa Corner, each course is separated
by a short break, each varying in duration.
During these breaks, Bodnar will talk to his
guests about avariety of topics, including food,
religion and his origins in Hungary.

Bodnar may even tell the story of how he
carved a bullet out of his own leg after Sovi-
ets shot him while ﬁghting in the Hungarian
Revolution of 1956. I

“I, myself, had more guts than brains,”
Bodnar acknowledged about his days as a
revolutionary. ' ‘

It certainly was more than just guts that got
him to where he is today. Bodnar.is a master
chef whose knowledge of food comes from
years of experiential learning from various
inﬂuences. After the revolution, he ﬂed Hun-
gary and landed in England, wherehe noticed
something peculiar about the cuisine. p

“They boil the hell out of everything,” he
proclaimed, “and everything was tasteless.”

When he came to Pittsburgh in 1957 at the
age of 15, he found good food and a thriving
Hungarian community. These traditionsslowly
faded as the city began to decline industrially.

Interestingly, Bodnar “always went back 

to grandma.” When he returned to Hungary
after the revolution was over, he learned the
real secrets of authentic Hungarian cooking,
along with his own love of serving food. And

his passion is obvious atjozsa Corner.]ust don.’t

get him started talking about food — he’ll go '

on all night.

Bodnar claims he “grew up” in the Pitts-
burgh area after coming here as a young man.

“He was 30 years old and still growing,” his
good friend and frequent visitorjohn Kerekg-
yarto said jokingly-from his seat at the bar. Not
surprisingly, Bodnar attributes his growth to
the abundance and richness of American food.

When Bodnar came to the United States for
the second time, he was a grown man. For the

‘next few decades, he made a living in graphic

arts and advertisinguntil the industry fell into
decline in the ’8os. He then bought the building
in Hazelwood in order to open a restaurant and
a resource for the local Hungarian community.
Bodnar now has a wife and family. J
Once a revolutionary, always a revolution-
ary. One would be hard—pressed to ﬁnd a place
quite like Jozsa Corner these days. But at 70
years old, Bodnar puts no unnecessary burden
on his shoulders. He does hold one special
event, Hungarian Night,'every second Friday
of the month. Guests that come on thisnight
are invited to sing folk songs and even speak
some Hungarian with Bodnar and his friends.
Jozsa Corner has withstood difﬁcult eco-
nomic times in a tough neighborhood. The eco-
nomically depressed, crime—ridden Hazelwood
area is by no means conducive to business. In
fact, most businesses packed up and moved
away a long time ago. ‘ .
Bodnar, on the other hand, has been in
business for about 25 years. As one of his many
favorite sayings goes, “Whatever seems dif-
ﬁcult will take a while, and whateverseems
impossible willjust take a little longer.” I

the track and for what rappers like Drake rep-
resent is a sort of guilt — middle—class guilt.
We’re conditioned —— and for good reason
—— to be grateful for such upbringings. After all,
it’s hard to imagine Chief Keef, now serving a

‘two-month sentence for a gun violation, had

it easy growing up. There probably werer1_’t

any little league soccer games on the South ,

Maybe that’s not the point. It’s possible that
Drake and rappers like him are speaking to
something larger. The courage to put your-
self out there openly and honestly is difﬁcult,
no matter the circumstances. And even if his
story isn’t as sad asjimmy Brooks’ ﬁctional
tale, maybe the bottom that Drake raps about
ismore universal than at ﬁrst glance. _I

Pitt football’s search for a new defensive coor-
dinator has concluded.

It was announced Monday in a statement
that head coach Paul Chryst decided to promote

I secondary coach Matt‘House to the position.

Chryst also hired two new defensive coach-
es.]ohn Palermo will join the team as defensive
ends and linebackers coach and Hank Poteat
will join as a graduate assistant.

Former defensive coordinator Dave
Huxtable left-Pitt in December before the BBVA
Compass Bowl to take the same position at ACC
school North Carolina State.

House, with the greater workload he’s as-

suming, will assist only with coaching the safe-
ties this season. He joined Chryst’s staff last year
after working with the NFL’s .St. Louis Rams
and Carolina Panthers for three years and on
year, respectively. ‘

“I was very impressed by Matt’s work last
year in the secondary,” Chryst said in the state-
ment. “He has been a great ﬁt for our program
as a coach, recruiter and teacher of the game.
His experiences and work ethic have more
than prepared him for this opportunity ‘to be
a coordinator.” , - 5

Palermo is a/38-year coaching veteran who
spent 15 years at the University of Wisconsin,
two _seasons with the‘ Washington Redskins
and this past season with the University of
Tennessee. ’

'coach,’? Chryst said. “I feel really fortunate to
have the opportunity to work with him again.
j.P.’s wealth _of experience is going to beneﬁt
our entire program, both coaches and play-
ers alike.” _ ‘

Poteat was a two-time ﬁrst—team All—Big East
cornerback in his four years at Pitt and led the
team in interceptions in 1998 and'1999..As a
junior in 1998, he led the Big East and ranked
fourth nationally with an average of 0.60 inter-

’ ceptions per game (six total). Poteat holds Pitt

records for kick return yards in a season (764

‘ yards in 1998) and a career (2,010).

He was athird-round selection of the Pitts’-

burgh Steelers in the 2000 NFL Draft.
Poteat played for ﬁve NFL teams over 10
years,‘ earning a Super Bowl ring as a member

. of the 2004 New England Patriots. He retired

from the professional game after the 2009 sea-
son and has spent the past two seasons coach-
ing defensive backs at Division 11 Kentucky
Christian University.

“We’re really excited to bring Hank back

home to Pitt,” Chryst said. “In addition to his

experience as an NFL player, Hank has coached
on the college level the past two years. His
knowledge of the game and of Pitt is going to
be a big asset for us.” I

, Winning isn’t easy when you give your

opponent a six—point advantage before
the contest has even begun.

Pitt has learned this a few times this D
season, having to forfeit at the 125—pound '

weight class. because its wrestlers
couldn’t make weight. A couple weeks
ago, Bloomsburg triumphed over the Pan-
thers, 19-18, in apivotal Eastern Wres-
tling League match that Pitt might’ve
won if one of its wrestlers had made 125
pounds‘. The defeat took away much hope
of Pitt continuing its league dominance

_ by winning the regular-season champion-

ship for the fourth-straight year. I

On Friday night, the peculiar inability
to compete at the 125—pound level would
cost-the three seniors a chance to leave
the Fitzgerald Field House victorious for
the last time in their careers.

In one of the ugliest games‘Panthers fans .

have likelylwitnessed at the Petersen Events
Center since it opened, the Pitt men’s bas-

ketball team suffered its second—straight ‘‘

loss Monday night with a 51-42 setback to
Notre Dame. '

No. 20 Pitt (20-7, 8-6 Big East) started
thevcontest on a 19-3 run at the behest of

_an 0-9 start from the ﬁeld by No. 25 Notre

Dame (21—6, 9-5 Big East).'

But from there, shots started falling for
the Fighting Irish, and Pitt’s lead began to
evaporate. Pitt held only a 22-19 lead at
the half, and Notre Dame took the lead for
‘good with 10:53 left in the contest after a
layup by Eric Atkins. V

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said it best All

after the game, essentially iterating that the _

Panthers just really didn’t do anything well
on either side of the ﬂoor Monday.

“[We’re] disappointed in our perfor— _

. pmance and our play, and our execution

in pretty much every facet,” Dixon said.
“There’s not much else to say. We got out-
rebounded, gave up 60 percent from the
ﬁeld, didn’t guard well enough, didn’t re-
bound, and our shot selection wasn’t very
good.” _ ' »

On the subject of shot selection, redshirt
senior guard Tray Woodall felt the Panthers
played selﬁshly and passed up too many
goodlooks at the basket. As aresult, Pitt
went away from its identity as a team and
took another loss ,— the first game Pitt
has lost since switching to new gold home
uniforms earlier this season.

“We played selﬁsh,” Woodall said. ‘fOur
assist numbersindicate and our rebound
numbers indicate how selfishly we played
tonight, and it resulted in a loss.” '

Pitt only registered 10 total assists Mon-
day, quite a far cry from the 17.2 assists it
averaged entering the game. Additionally,
Pitt was out-rebounded for the eighth time
this season and lost for the sixth time of
those games. Notre Dame ended with a 40-
25 advantage over Pitt on the glass.

Even early on, when Pitt jumped out to

/3’

its 16-point lead, the Irish still maintained ‘‘

an advantage on the boards.

ROGER THAT

Pitt offense goes missing in demoraliingloss to Notre Dame

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

. Losing a basketball game to a team that

scored three points in the game’s ﬁrst 13
minutes and ﬁnished with an unimpressive
51 points can’t happen. It just can’t.

But it did on Monday night as the No.
20 Pitt men’s basketball team blew an ear-
ly 19-3 lead during a disheartening 51-42
defeat against No. 25 Notre Dame at the
Petersen Events Center.

Speakers at the postgame press confer-
ence expressed the frustration felt by the
Panthers after losing a game in such de-
moralizing style.

“Today was just a bad gamefor us. We

played selﬁsh,” senior point guard Tray

Woodall said, shaking his head. “We’re a
team that passes the ball, but the numbers
indicate how selﬁsh we played. We gave this
game away.” ‘

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon’s demeanor
wasn’t much different than Woodall’ .

“We’ve got to get something ﬁxed, get
something changed,” Dixon said. “This
isn’t the same team [as it was two weeks
ago]. To ‘get out-rebounded by 15 is just
unbelievable.”

Nothing made sense in this game.

First Notre Dame (21-6, 9-5 Big East)
couldn’t score. Then Pitt (20-7, 8-6 Big East)
couldn’t score.

Both offenses were doing their best im-
pressions of Manti Te’o’s girlfriend for vari-
ous spells throughout the game.

In the end, the Irish scored more, earn-
ing a crucial conference victory that moves
them above a Pitt team suddenly slipping
down the Big East standings.

It began so well for the Panthers, too.

Notre Dame converted a free throw to
open the scoring, but then Pitt took control
of the game. With a dominating defense
that forced the Fighting Irish to miss 17 of
their ﬁrst 18 shots, the Panthers maintained
enough offensive efficiency to build a'19-3
lead with less than seven minutes remaining
in the ﬁrst half.

But when that offensive efﬁciency crum-
bled away, so did Pitt‘.

Notre Dame clawed back into the game
with a 16-3 run to end the half.

“We felt great being down just three
— that’s amoral victory at halftime,” said
giddy Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey
after thegame. .

Unfortunately for the Panthers and their
discouraged fans, the run didn’t end there.

In the second half, Notre Dame kept
scoring. Pitt kept, well, doing everything

except scoring. In the process, the Pan‘-‘

thers passed up several good shots for bad
shots, another act that Woodall described
as “selﬁsh.”

The difference in the conﬁdence levels
of each team was palpable.

With that renewed vigor, the Fighting
Irish_ slowly but surely turned the three-
point halftime deﬁcit into a nine-point lead
for thelvisitors late in the game, effectively

using Coach Brey’s “burn” offense down the .

stretch to kill off the contest.

When the ﬁnal buzzer sounded, Notre
Dame had ﬁnished the game on a dumb-
founding 48-23 run in the last 27 minutes.

Dixon was left ruing all of the mistakes
his team made.

“Obviously, we were disappointed in: our
play and execution,’.’ he said. “We didn’t
guard, didn’t rebound well and our shot
selection wasn’t very good.”

So where does_Pitt go from here? How
does a team recover from losing a high-
scoring affair ‘on Saturday and dropping a
defensive slugfest on Monday?

With four winnable games remaining

. on their regular-season schedule, maybe

this was just the kind of game the Panthers
needed: A game that helped this team re-
discover its identity, whatever it may be.

It’s pretty apparent what Dixon wants
the Panthers’ identity to be.

“We’ve got to defend better for 40 min-
utes. We’ve got to get rebounding from every
position.” ‘

Defense and rebounding are great.

But some offense would be nice, too. I

Pitt couldn’t hold off Notre Dame clown the stretch. Andy Slepman | For The Pitt News

“We never took control of the game,
as a far as rebounding,” senior forward
Dante Taylor said. “We deﬁnitely knew
that we were getting out-rebounded. That’s
something we go over in every timeout.”

What some may attribute to turning the
proverbial tide was the technical foul called
on Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey in the
ﬁrst half, after which Woodall said, “the
game just changed.” The technical foul was
issued with 7:08 in the ﬁrst half and from
there, Brey’s squad ﬁnished the game on

a 48-23 run that more than made up the
lead Pitt held early in the game.

« Keying the comeback were two three-
pointers off the hands of Pat Connaughton
that brought the score to 19-9. But in the
eyes of Brey, Connaughton’s shots meant
so much more than the six points they

V provided.

“It felt like we tied it. The climate in
the building changed,” Brey said. “For
our group to withstand that start, I’m‘
just so thrilled with how we guarded and
rebounded.”

In the second half, Notre Dame’s of-
fense ﬁnally found its groove while Pitt’s
faltered. The Irish shot 60 percent from

the field in the second half, while Pitt shot
_ 34.8 percent and was outscored 32-20.

Notre Dame’s Jerian Grant ended tied
for the game high in scoring with team-
mate Jack Cooley at 13 points and made a

I number of jump shots off ball screens late
in the game to keep Notre Dame’s lead at
a comfortable margin.

Alongside Grant, fellow backcourt-mate
Atkins scored 10 points and handed out
seven assists. Only one Panther ﬁnished in
‘double-ﬁgures, as Woodall ended with 11
points. Steven Adams’ eight points served
as the_only other tally above ﬁve.

Now, after a 6-1 stretch pushed No. 20
Pitt near the top of the Big East conference

standings, back-to-back losses against No.
18 Marquette and No. 25 Notre Dame leave
the Panthers back down in the middle of
the pack when it comes to Big East regular-
season title contention. Pitt must figure
things out before it plays Sunday at St.
John’s in one of its ﬁnal four games —- four
games Pitt will need to win if the Panthers

hope to score a double-bye in the Big East .

Tournament. ,

“We can’t dwell on this game. We just
gotta come back and ﬁnd each other and
ﬁnd ourselves. You know, look at ourselves
and know we gave this game away,” Wood-
all said.e“Tonight, selﬁshness was the cause
of everything.” Q

- Nelson or Nyama

. point disadvantage

Both Derrick Nelson and Godwin
Nyama have wrestled at the weight class
for the Panthers but have failed to make
weight the past two matches.

“Not having a 125 is killing us,” Zac

Thomusseit said. “We are a top-15 team, .

and we can’t ﬁeld a
whole team.”

Thomusseit was hit with a single—leg take-
down, Lehigh’s N0. 3 Robert Hamlin held
on to win his match 4-2. Hamlin’s victory
put the Mountain Hawks up "22-8’ with
only two matches remaining to seal the‘
victory for the visitors.

‘ ' “I feel you have
to wrestle the best

Thomusseit is
hopeful that either

will return for the
match against Edin-
boro this Friday.
“Our goal is to
have one for the Ed-
inboro match,” Zac
Thomusseit said.
“Our guys need to
do the right things
tolget their weight
under control.”
Adding to the
difficulty of the six-

“Not having a

Max Thomusseit
said of his third-
_ ranked opponent.

coach Pat San-
toro, who" wres-
tled'at Pitt and
is still Pitt’s only
- four—time All-
American, spoke
highly of Pitt’s
184—pounder.
“Max Thomus-
seit is really tal-
I ented,” Santoro

was the potential of .
any carryover from last week’s one—._sided

V affair with Penn State. But Zac Thomus-I

seit’s brother, Max, insisted that the loss
to the Nittany Lions didn’t affect the
team’s perfornianceiin the Lehigh match.

“Losing to PSU doesn’t carry over into

'Lehigh,” the redshirt sophomore said.
_ “You have to forget about one loss and '

.move on to your next match.”

No. 7 Zac Thomusseit felt differently,
however. ' .

. “I think the,Penn State loss took a lot
out of-‘wind out of our sail,” the heavy-
weight said. - 1

Pitt got a boost at 133 pounds when
Mack came out with an aggressive ap-
proach against Lehigh. He jumped out in
the first period with two takedowns and
recorded two in the ﬁnal period, as well.
In recent matches, Mack had been get—
ting good starts but allowing opponents
to come back. A

“I feel good about my match,” Mack
said. “After losing last week, I knew that
being more aggressive was one of the
things I needed_ to work on. It was defi-
nitely a part of the game plan.”

.The‘ Panthers had to divert from the
game plan at 141 pounds as Corey Bush
was forced to replace Travis Shaffer, who
is out with a torn meniscus but plans to

i said. “Heican be
on the podium

. in March [at national championships].

We knew it would be a battle and Robert
[Hamlin] would have to fight for every
point.” . - .

The Panthers got solid performances

out of their top two wrestlers, senior -

197-pounder No. 3 Matt Wilps and senior
heavyweight wrestler Zac Thomusseit.

Matt Wilps picked up a win, 7-2, in
the final match of his career. The third-
ranked wrestler got an important win
after a tough loss the weekbefore to
then-third-ranked Quentin Wright of
Penn State. , .

“I -felt good out there,” Matt Wilps said.
“I’m over [that] loss.” '

Zac Tho_musseit’s 3—2‘victory capped

the overall bitter night sweetly as two of
the three seniors won in their ﬁnal home
matches — 157—pound Donnie Tasser’s
ﬁnal home match ended in a 6-3 loss.
A “It was nice to get a win on senior
night,” Zac Thomusseit said. “But I felt
like I should have won by a bigger margin.
I needed to open up a little more.”

Pitt returns to the mat on Friday when

. it travels to Edinboro. The Panthers can’t
win the Eastern Wrestling League regular- .

season title, but they do have ‘an opportu-
nity to win the EWL tournament for the
third-straight time. ﬁ
