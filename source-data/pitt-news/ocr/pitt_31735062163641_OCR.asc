There are two levels, Dr. Mar-*

the underclass

In discussing "the present status-pi:

of the Honors Program, he ‘indi-
cated the diiﬁculty of setting up

which vary ‘greatly in size and

have an interdisciplinary nature
in some areas. ~
.Dr. Martin also explained that
the honors courses are designed, .
on the underclass level to sup-_
port the objectives of the Dis»-
tribution of Studies program;
but on the upper class level,
they should offer the student
“all he can take” in the way of
academic__ challenge.
The improvement in advising
was attributed to careful choosing

of only graduate students with _ ' 

“sincere interest” as advisors.

Demolition Set
To Make Way
For Library

The Park Schenley and several
other Forbes Avenue buildings
will soon be razed to make way
for the new $10,300,000 'Hillman
Library, University officials have
announced.

The library site is bounded by
Pennant Way, Sennott Street and
Schenley Park. The building itself
will be the keystone of the gradu-
ate school complex to replace
Forbes Field.‘ 5

The completed library’ will
house 1,750,000 volumes with a
seating capacity of 2400 persons
and 96 faculty study rooms. It
will provide graduate and limited
undergraduate facilities and will
permit intercommunication ..be-
tween the library and the gradu-
ate school complex. Each of the
graduate school buildings will ul-
timatelylbe connected with the
library, although they will have
separate ground floor libraries for
their own professions. -

The library plan includes en-
closed sculpture courts on the
ground ﬂoor which will provide
private outdoor study. Second and
third ﬂoors are basically stack
areas with faculty studies and bay
windows. Elevators and mechan-
ical equipment will be conﬁned
to a central core.

It is hoped that construction will

begin late this summer. Plans call
for complettion of the building in
1966.

STER, JR., of Yale University,

policy making all undergraduates

Linguistic Exhibits   gas

A‘!

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

“O FAT.” Don’t get insulted. That comment isn’t a
psychological advertisement for Metrecal, but simply an in-
ternational linguist saying “Our father.” g

Dr. Gerard Fraenkel, Chairman of the Committee on‘ 7-“
Linguistics, selected this and other information on interna-
tional languages for the linguistic exhibit now on display on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral. 0

This exhibit began as an accom-
panying feature of.Dr. Fraenkel’s
linguistic course and experimental
high school text. But Dr. ‘Fraenkel .
also realized that people needed
reminding of the linguistics pro— ~
gram in the University.

With the assistance of Sylvia
Ruﬂfa, he prepared" the exhibit
largely from his personal collec-
tion‘. “For me, personally, the in‘-‘
terest is purely Iinguistic. Study-
ing reveals the ideal structure and
universal qualities‘ of language.” I

international language has little
feasibility. - A . ~ T
As proof of this contention
the exhibit offers evidence that
les than one third of one per
cent of the 'world’s population
speaks ‘ Esperanto. Surprisingly
this inter-lingua language is
more widely used than any
other, including’ 7Globaquo, ‘La-'
.lortel, Lingua Komunand Idiom
Neutral. _

“Every person is involved’
with language and should there-

of international language-—com-
munication. Most people don’t -
know that there are about 700
artiﬁcial‘ languages invented at
a rate of about one every two

' weeks.” — I

A large amountof these experi-
mental languages are, unfortun-
ately, created “by lunatic French.
Very few have been created by
serious linguists.” ’

Dr. Fraenkel, evidently has no
aspirations of inventing the ‘per-
fect language.. “I’m a linguist. I

would never “create’ a language,
because I ’realize there never is an   E.

’Educa’rion: The Green. Degree

What in the name of Horace Mann has happened to higher education in America?
In the old days it used to be that people came to college, to be educated, i.e. to further

their understanding of the human condition and to cultivate their mental processes of
evaluation. Well that idea of education went out the back window a long time ago.
Nowada s people come to college because education spells success. It’s a standing rule .
that coll}ege graduates make more money than high school graduates and therefore
«everyone and his brother should go to college. . . “ ” . W ”  “1
Unfortunately, from this rule stems the spirit that college IS in. ut , earn-

Editor, The Pitt News
Ever=since the government’
report on smoking was made
public, there had been a proli-
feration of “You’re a fool if you
don’t believe what_ you read”
articles“ appearing in the na-
tion's periodicals. As an in-
dulger myself, I felt Iiowed it
to my conscience to read, these
articles in order to frighten my-
self into giving up the cancer
stick. The more I read the
more determined Iibecame to
give" up cigarette smoking and

presently I like to consider my-
self a worshipper of the _god_

of Clean Lungs. In this frame
, of mind, I picked up the Jan-
uary 17th issué ‘of The Pitt
News and ran across your edi-
torial concerning smoking and
its I surprisingly bright future.
As I read the artic1e,_,I again
found myself I saying “right,
ﬁine, correct,‘ I believe it,
check, I’m giving the damn
things up for 'good.”~ All was
' fine until I came to the last
paragraph where the idea was
expressed that the majority of
the people concerned can’t be

rationally convinced of the dan- ‘
gers of smoking and will not:

.stop"even to save their own
’ health. Ergo, you state, the
"best solutionswloluld obviously
be to h_ave the "government ini-
tiate legislation to prohibit the
sale of cigarettes to stop these
idiots from committing a can-
cerous suicide. At this point
you proposed an evil greater

than the one ‘you would like to '

see rectiﬁed."

Wholeheartedly agreed, ci-
garette smoking is not the
healthiest thing in the world,
but the type of legislation and
government" control you pro-
pose is equally, if not more,

dangerous. I fully realize this‘

type of legislation would be in
the public interest as far as
smoking is concerned, but you

are disregarding" the public’s *

political welfare. Whether the
majority of the public can "be
rationally convinced ‘of the
dangers inherent in smoking is
not too debatable—they.can be

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

By the time this review is read by the populace at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, “Billy Liar” will have departed for greener pas-
tures. Unless business perked up over the'weekend, this wonderful
screen comedy from Great Britain will have left Pittsburgh after a
whole ten days of showings at the Squirrel Hill. It is one of those
ridiculous situationswhere a ﬁne ﬁlm came to town, and thanks to a
terrible publicity job,Twas doomed to failure.

The only thing I can really "say about the situation is that
the loss is Pittsburgh’s’a.nd a real pity it is. “Billy Liar” is one
of the-most rollicking and fun-ﬁlled motion pictures to be brought
over to our shores from England and represents a fine effort on
the part of the English movie-makers. The ﬁlm deals with a corn-
pulsive liar who is not believed by any of his friends, girl friends,
or associates. He just enjoys lying‘ and as played. by Tom
Courtenay, Billy becomes another chapter in the great tradition
of “Walter Mitty.” The British import is based. on a play of the

same name, which, in turn, is based on a novel by a talentedt
writer named Keith Waterhouse. ‘

“Billy Liar” was translated to the motion picture screen after a

ever.ybody’s best picture of 1963, the producer and John Schlesinger,

A very talented .man is John,Schlesinger. 'He._also came on

By ART FLEISCHNER

 

HasLittle Success

Chances of having a winning track team around here
are only slightly better than getting George Lincoln
Rockwell to join the B’nai B’rith. Recent track records

I here look like the statistics of an unsuccessful baseball
pitcher.

From 1958 until last year the outdoor track records
were 2-4, 2-3, 2-3, 2-5, 1-4, and 3-4. The height of consis-

’ , tency, but not the epitome of suc-
cess.

The last time a track coach
came up with a winning mark
here was when Carl Olson was in
charge of the team. Olson ‘pro-
duced such great stars as Olym-
pia Arnie Sowell and John Wood-
ruff. Yet he was let go because
he reached the mandatory retire-
ment age. Someone must have felt
that success is only for the young.
Olson proved them wrong. He ‘still
turns out a winner every year at
Carnegie Tech.

Olson was succeeded by his assistant, Carl Rees.
Rees has yet to turn in a winning outdoor season.
His teams have frequently humbled by schools that
Pitt can hold their own with in other sports. All
this, despite the fact that Rees gets more scholarship-
aid than Olson did.

Rees and his team were “looking with optimism to-
wards the current indoor season and the upcoming
outdoor season. They had, they thought, good reason for
such optimism. The optimism bubble burst last Satur-
day when Army humiliated the track team, 83-37. Some
of the team’s runners actually thought the Panthers were
going to beat the Cadets. This kind of thinking makes
‘Cassius Clay seem like a pessemist.

A bumpy plane ride to West Point was given as part
of the reason for the thrashing, but a few sick runners
don't account for a 46 point difference. There is much
more to what ails the track team.

The runners actually had reason for some optimism.
Rees has some very good individuals on the team this
year. Bill DelVecchio is one of the top sprinters in the
country. In Joe Friend, Luddy Hayden, Al Thomassey,
Gary Meckley and John Bailey Rees has some potential-
ly ﬁne performers. ’

‘A But there is more to athletics than ‘talent. It’s
Just about a set rule that Pitt distance runners tend to
get worse, rather than improve in their stay here. In
the three ‘years preceding this season the top dis-
tance runner has been a king size flop the following
year. _
_ Rees has had some potentially good pole—vaulters
in recent years, but despite fantastic assault on the rec-
ord book by pole vaulters in recent years, no Pitt pole
vaulter has yet to clear 15 feet, let along come close to
16 feet.

There have been other instances of trackmen not
coming anywhere near their expected performances.
There have also been some performers who have done
better than expected. But these have been in a minority.

The track team’s record speaks for itself. Losing
season after losing season indicates there is more than
ta-lent missing from the track team.

F rosh Hoopsters Seek 6th Win
Against Slippery Rock Jayvees

 

BOB SMIZIK

_ By KEITH SACHS
The freshman basketball team, victorious in ﬁve of its last six

games, hosts the Slippery Rock J.V.’s tomorrow night at Fitzgerald
Field House. « '

The meeting will be the second between the two squads this
season and the Cubs are hoping?
they can make it a clean sweep.
In an earlier game at Slippery
Rock, the freshmen came out on
top by a 77-53 score.

Last Saturday night, the Cubs
put on a big second half to gain a
69-60 comeback victory over
Johnstown College. The win was
the second over Johnstown this
‘year. The frosh had won, 93-85,
earlier this season at Johnstown.

Bob LaValley_ played his ﬁn-
est game of the season in lead-
ing the Cubs to their ﬁfth vic-

tory of the year. LaValley
scored scored 30 points on 11
ﬁeld goals and 8 .free throws.
His previous high this year had
been 15 against Point Park.
Stan Falenski, who has been
leading the team in scoring all
season long, suffered a recur-
rence of an old shoulder injury
and managed to score only 10
points.

' Bob Boring and Stan -Chapman

points; respectivelyn  -~ = - -

Panther coach Bob Timmons
said, “Westminster is usually a
good shooting club. They play
a‘ strong defensive game using
either a man to man or zone
defense. We expect a tough
game tonight.” _

Tonight’s game could be a lot
easier for the Panthers‘ if cen-

“On offense he doesn’t get
the ball much because that’s
the way our attack goes. He’s
used mainly for a screen for
the guards or the cornermen.
Most of the points he gets are
the result of his getting a re-
bound and putting it'up.”
Despite the fact that most of
the credit for the success of
this year’s team has gone to the
guards, Krieger’s work has not
gone unnoticed. West Virginia
coach George King called him
“the key to "the Panther attack.”
Guard Cal Shefﬁeld is lead-
ing the Panthers with a 17.8
average. Brian Generalovich is
second with 16.8. The work of
Sheffield, 'Dave Roman and
sophomore Larry Szykowny are

a major reason for Pitt’s 10-4.

Timmons commented, “Our
guards can shoot. They can also
lead the fast break. Roman was
in a slump for a while but he
is alright now. This is the best
guard combination I’ve had at
Pitt. ‘

“Guards Tim Grgurich and ‘
Dink Larkin are good, but
they have better players ahead

along faster than expected and
as a result Grgurich has not

Forward Daryle Ruby did not

5 Diver Hahnfeldt to Meet All-American
In Maryland Swim Meet This Saturday

By GUY BUCCI

To most people, the great-
est‘ aquatic challenge of
their life comes the day
they jumpinto three feet
of Water at the commun-
ity swimming pool. But to
Don Hahnfeldt, something like
the‘ Eastern_ Collegiate Diving
Championship would be more
of a challenge. -

As a rule most divers
slightly built. But Don is a well-
muscled six footer. He -feels
that his size isn’t much of a
disadvantage when he has to
pull off some twists. and spins
in mid-air which would be
slightly easier for a smaller di-
ver. , -

Hahnfeldt has 0 v e r c o m (2
every diving challenge which
has ever faced him. He-has
taken ‘the’ WPIAL diving
championship, the Pennsyl-
vania State diving champion-
ship, the local AAU Men’s

Senior d i v i n g championship

and his ﬁrst three varsity div-

ing meets.

This should be enough’ cham-
pionships to last a lifetime. But
with ‘a family like Hahnfeldt has,
Don can’t ‘rest on his laurels.
His younger brothers, Jon_and
Fred,-"are already pressing on
his high school marks, and col-
lege teammate Ed Coleman is

ED COLEMAN
Pushed Halmfeldt

pushing him for every collegi-
‘ ate victory. . ‘
Coleman has pushed Hahn-
feldt so far that Don (broke Cole-
man’s old diving mark of 235
by 23 points to a 258 against
Lehigh. In doing this, Ed bet-
tered ‘his own mark by some
ten points. But typical of Hahn-
feldt’s self-critical attitude, he
said of his new record, “The
judges ' were scoring thigh.”
Hahnfeldt is unsure of his

DON HAHNFELDT
Seeks Eastern Title

diving future. He hates to
sound cocky, so he won’t say
deﬁnitely that_ he is going to
the Olympic trials this year.
Ben Grady, his coach who was
a former National Collegiate
diving champion, has "this
to say about I-lahnfeldt’s chan-
ces, “He’s still learning. If we
get him working he could be
a good tower diver and go
to the Olympic trials.”
While talk persists of Eastern,

 
 

National. and Olympic titles,

Hahnfeldt is concentrating on the_

swim meet against Maryland
Saturday. It is against Mary-
land that Hahnfeldt will be
given his ﬁrst taste of nation-
ally-reeognized diving competi-
tion.

Maryland’s all-time great di-
ver Ron Squires will provide
Hahnfeldt with‘ the toughest
competition he has ever faced.

Squires is an all-America
diver. By,defeating Squires in
a. dual meet, Hahnfeldt would
obtain a tremendous psycho-
logical advantage f o r their
meeting in the Easterns.

Perhaps the best indication of
Hahnfeldt’s ability‘ comes when
he is compared to teammate

Coleman. Coleman took a very ‘

respectable eighth in a forty
man competition in the Eastern
Collegiate D i v i n g “Champion-
ships last’March. Although Cole-
man has improved over last
year’s performance, I_-Iahnfeldt
has had no trouble besting him
in competition this year.

The Maryland m eet will
prove to Hahnfeldt if he is ready
for the really big-time in col-
legiate diving. His records have
indicated that he has bested the
best in high school, and in AAU
competition. He has to go against

‘the very best in the country
Saturday.
