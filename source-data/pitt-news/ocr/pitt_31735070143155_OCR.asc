Serving politics,
lacking pancakes

Graduate student breakfast looks at health care

Caitlyn Christensen
Stajfwriter

 

There were no pancakes at the ﬁrst
of the Pancakes & Politics breakfast
series.

“What really got me here today
was the pancakes,” Congressman
Mike Doyle joked, “and when I got
here there are no pancakes to be
found!”

Instead, the group’s organizers
served French toast. ’

Danjimenez, the president of the
Graduate and Professional Student
Assembly, said he wanted to get Pa-
mela’s Diner to cater the free event.
But the University has a policy that

allows Sodexo to cater its events.
Since Jimenez missed the deadline
to ask Sodexo for an extension, the
50 or so students who gathered in the
William Pitt Union Lower Lounge to
hear Doyle speak munched on French
toast instead.

“We kept the name because we
liked the alliteration,”Jimenez said.

Free food aside, the Graduate
and Professional Student Assembly
hopes its new breakfast series will
give students the opportunity to ask
public officials about issues that in-
terest them.

Currently the program is geared
toward graduate students, butJime-
nez said that might change in the

Looking for anew home, ﬁghting for a new life

Local activists gather at Oakland forum to encourage services that help homeless people receive food, shelter and health care

Liz Navratil -

News Editor

I ike Wurschmidtwas driv-
 g through suburban
Aurora, Colo., one day 22

years ago when he passed a fancy
sports car with a hoseblocking the
exhaust pipe.

Noticing a man inside was try-
ing to kill himself, Wurschmidt ran
to the car, knocked and, when the
man inside didn’t answer, smashed

the window.

Wurschmidt pulled the man out
of the car, held him and began cry-
ing for help. It was around 3 a.m. and
during the age before cell phones.

“As I’m holding this man on my
knees, I began weeping. I began
asking this rhetorical question:
‘Why? What could be so bad to
make this man want to kill himself?”
Wurschmidt said.

But he already knew the answer
to that — because earlier that day,
Wurschmidt, recently homeless,

nearly tried to kill himself.

- Unable to hold a job as a busi-
nessman and to support his wife,
daughter and the son they were ex-

’ pecting, Wurschmidt nearly drove

off a cliff.

As he cradled the unconscious
man, Wurschmidt “just said, ‘God,
will you give me a chance?’ I knew as
I was holding that man that I didn’t
want to die. I wanted to live.”

With help from Christian char-
ity organization World Vision,
Wurschmidt and his family moved

to Pittsburgh, where he attended
seminary.

Today, Wurschmidt, the rector at
Shepherd’s Heart parish Downtown,
devotes his time to providing food,
shelter and laundry services to some
of Pittsburgh’s nearly 2,000 home-
less people.

Wurschmidtwas one of six peo-
ple to speak at aforum for homeless-
ness at Carnegie Mellon yesterday.
Other speakers included U.S. Rep.
Mike Doyle, D—Allegheny County;
Sarah Kahn, director of ﬁeld mobi-

lization for the National Alliance to
End Homelessness; Mike Lindsay,
from the country Department of Hu-
man Services; Adrienne Walnoha,
executive director of the Oakland-
based Community Human Services
Corporation; and Wurschmidt.
Wurschmidt encouraged the 40

to 50 people who attended the fo-
rum to work toward “overcoming
the face of homelessness.” Many of
the attendees worked in organiza-
tions dedicated to serving homeless
people.

UPMC outlines new vaccine center proposal

Seeking federal funding for the $580 million project, UPM C hopes to play a larger role inﬁghting bioterrorism

Jayson Myers
Staﬂ’ Writer

With a little help from the federal
government, UPMC ofﬁcials be-
lieve they can tackle bioterrorism
by becoming one of the world’s

largest vaccine producers.
Wendy Zellner, a UPMC spokes-

woman, predicted that the medical‘

center could save the U.S. govern-
ment more than $28 billion over
25 years and create 7,000 jobs
if it builds a new vaccine center
and switches ‘the way it produces

shots.

Zellner said in an e-mail that
UPMC would begin to use dispos-
able parts when creating vaccines,
allowing it to switch from produc-
ing one vaccine to another in a
short amount of time. The quicker
turnaround, she said, would al-

future.

“It all depends on the level of in-
terest and support,” he said.

About 50 students turned up in
the William Pitt Union Lower Lounge
to hear Doyle speak about health care
at 8:15 yesterday morning.

“Health care is the biggest thing
happening in Congress right now,”
Jimenez said. “And it is what is go-
ing to be affecting us for the rest of
our lives.”

Doyle spent the ﬁrst half of the
forum talking about health care and
the second taking questions from the
audience.

Doyle spoke about speciﬁc con-
cerns young people should have for
the current health care crisis.

With current medical costs ris-
ing faster than inﬂation and sig-

derinsured,” Doyle said. “And half
of all bankruptcies in America are
due to medical costs. What do we do
to reign in health care cost, and in
doing so, how can we provide access
for all?”

“Doing nothing is not an op-
tion,” Doyle said. “It would be
a grave mistake to let this op-
portunity pass.”

Carol Haines, a part—time
student in the business school,
came to the breakfast to ask
Doyle how the government ex-

“I don’t apologize for what we’ve

done in the federal government,” -

Doyle said. “I think we’ve done a darn

Kate Faunce, a third year audiol-
ogy student in the School of Health
and Rehabilitation Sciences, was
happy with Doyle’s address.

I don’t apologize for what we’ve done in
the federal government.

Rep. Mike Doyle '

care plan “when they have failed
to run programs such as Medicare

defended the success of Medicare.

know that Medicare doesn’t provide
a lot of the services he said,” Haines
said.

Haines expressed mixed emo-

Faunce said. “I’m going into a medical

attention to what’s going on in the

Faunce said that she liked the pro-

Chief Executive Dan Onorato and
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, are also on
the list of ﬁxture invitees.

Panhandle-less  

Oakland service director: Most of Oakland’s homeless do not panhandle

Forum 4 3

“It is not limited to that one
person digging out of a trash can,”
Wurschmidt said. “There are so
many different faces.” _

Walnoha said after the forum
that while speciﬁc numbers aren’t
available — many surveys tend to be
city— or county—wide — Oakland has

-a signiﬁcant homeless population, '

and itsmembers don’t appear where

— most students might think.

She said the majority of Oakland’s
homeless people‘ don’t panhandle
along Forbes or Fifth avenues.
Instead, they hide away from the
hustle and bustle, often spending
the night behind businesses so they
can use the heat from their vents to
keep warm.

They tend to be single adults, she
said, because homeless families tend
to stay away from the hectic environ-
ment that is sometimes Oakland.

Lindsay said about 44 percent of

' adults using the county’s homeless

services have either a college degree
or credit toward one.
Preventing homelessness, Wal-

 

noha said, is becoming more diffi-
cult than before. The program had
the title “A Pay Away: The Realities

, of Homelessness.”

 

We aren’t even lucky '
enough to_be one
paycheck [away].

Adrienne Walnoha

“We aren’t even lucky enough

i for it to be one paycheck [away] ,”

she said. “Six months of earned in-
come is what we need to have saved
at this moment to prevent home-
lessness.” _ '

Estimates from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment show that the number of
homeless people across the nation

remained almost the same in 2008
as it was in 2007 — 664,414 on an
average night in 2008, compared to
an estimated 671,888 in 2007.

But that in and of itselfis “alarm-
ing,” Kahn said.

In the years prior to the reces-
sion, levels of homelessness were
dipping off because of an increase
in federal funding for homeless-
ness prevention programs, Kahn
said. But aid organizations nation-

wide are struggling to keep up with y
‘a spike in homelessness since the

recession, Kahn said, adding that
she wanted attendees to encourage
their legislators to pass initiatives
aimed at offering more comprehen-
sive care -— such as mental health
and substance abuse services — to
homeless people and ending home-
lessness amongst veterans and chil-
dren.

Yesterday’s forum is the l<ick— off
event for a sleep-out for the home-
less that will occur on the steps of

town, Oct. 9-10.

“Over the past decade, we

tion,” Romoff said in his testimony.
“There are concrete and innovative

be taking to deal with these vulner-
abilities and challenges that will
make us farbetter prepared for a
range of crises.”

Romoff said the country cur-
rently relies on small biotechnol-

ogy companies, which often can’t
use the newest technology, to pro-
duce its vaccines. Creating a new
center at UPMC, which would be
capable of producing vaccines in
bulk and on short notice, he said,
would save the nation money and
better prepare it for public health
threats. ‘

Zellner said congressional re-
ports categorize biological weap-
ons as weapons of mass destruc-
tion. They also predict that a future
attack on the United States would
more likely use biological weapons
than nuclear ones, she said.

The idea for the new center has
been in the works for three years,
since UPMC received a grant from
the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the Department
of Defense. If approved, the project
could receive funding in the 2011
federal budget and be operational
by 2013.

Editorial

Reltindling Pitt’s
football spirit

Historically speaking, Pitt is a
football powerhouse. They’ve
won nine national championships.
Today, it’s a different story. While
the team remains competitive, stu-
dents’ and Pittsburgh residents’
fervor for our football team seems
to have declined with our team’s
chances to win another national
championship.

When a team’s winning record
sinks, it can be difﬁcult to keep its
fan base aﬂoat. That’s a univer-
sal rule. But there’ve been other
factors besides playing ability
that have weakened Panther fans’
loyalty, and the losses are both a
cause and effect of this unfortunate
trend.

The Panthers used to have their
own football stadium on campus:
Pitt Stadium sat 69,400 fans -
and it regularly sold out games.
Today, the Panthers play at the
cushy Heinz Field. But playing
home games on a ﬁeld that’s really
the home turf of another team -
the Steelers — just isn’t the same.
In addition to losing the students
dissuaded by the commute, los-
ing their own stadium means the
Panthers lost a part of their im-
age. Sure, big stadiums serve as a
means to watch games ﬁrsthand,
but the structure also provides a
tangible symbol of the program’s
strength. It’s no coincidence that
Pitt’s basketball team entered the
upper echelon right as the Pe-
tersen Events Center opened for
business.

Today, the Panthers hold strife
with West Virginia University. But
for years it was Penn State —— and
what a heated and historic rivalry
it was. It wouldn’t be fair to say
Pitt students don’t get ﬁred up for
the Backyard Brawl — we’re still
relishing in our 2007 victory over
then No. 2 WVU. But the Pitt vs.
Penn State rivalry was arguably
the best intrastate rivalry in the
country. Aside from the big game
between the two teams, a strong
rivalry boosts spirit all season as
football fans statewide feel the
need to pick a side.

Pittsburgh still clings to its
appearance as a blue-collar, steel

town. Pitt, on the other hand, con-
tinually markets itself as a more
progressive institution that’s be-
coming synonymous with technol-
ogy and advanced medicine. Un-
less Pittsburgh and Pitt are thought
of somewhat synonymously, locals
and students alike feel little need
to channel their Pittsburgh loyalty
toward the Panthers.

Thinking realistically, there are
a few measures to amp up spirit
and attendance at football games.
At $25, the cost of student season
tickets is now-incredibly reason-
able.

As team logos can provide the
ultimate embodiment and identi-
ﬁer of allegiance to a team, Pitt
should revert back to its cursive
yellow “Pitt” logo that ﬂourished
in the team’s heyday. Some nostal-
gia will show that we’re proud of
our history, something Pittsbur-
ghers appreciate.

Basketball is now on top in Pitt’s
sporting community, but there’s no
shame in offering loyalty points at
football games if it will increase
attendance. The points, which in-
crease a student’s chances in the
lottery to purchase tickets for Pitt’s
basketball games, are offered at
select winter sports games such as
volleyball, swim meets and wom-
en’s basketball games. Nationally
reputed as one of the best student
sections in the country, perhaps
the Oakland Zoo can spread its
passion to enhance the Panther
Pitt, our dedicated-yet-stagnant
football student section.

The Panthers play at Heinz
ﬁeld, but you’d never know it when
it’s not game day. Throughout the
stadium run an array of ads and a
sea of black and gold. Our Panthers
hold virtually no presence. If we
can’t have a home to call our own,
we need to make Heinz Field feel
more like it’s our stadium, too.

As tomorrow will be the Pan-
thers’ opening game, the Panther
Pitt will surely see relatively good

- attendance. Yes, Pitt and its fans

are making an effort to keep atten-
dance up and spirit alive all season.
But this year’s as good a time as any
to try something new.

One 

Music, partying uncertain combo  

Does music imitate parties, or do parties imitate music?

 
 
 
 

Ben Korman
Columnist

Popular music charts have never
been a bastion of the world’s most
profound lyricism. The predomi-
nant themes of pop music evolve
over time, of course, but generally
show little variation at speciﬁc points
— and right now, the predominant
theme seems to be partying.

Disclaimer: I am not anti—par-
tying. The partying institution has
merits that carmot be supplied by,
say, those of higher academia or do-
mestic gardening.

For college students speciﬁcally,
partying provides much—needed
reprieve from the rigors of a hectic

to biblical times, and the two entities
are today so tightly intertwined that
a party without music feels hollow,
void of life and would likely be de-
scribed by college folk as “lame.”
In this sense, the urge to com-
bine partying with music that is
essentially about partying seems

. perfectly reasonable. In fact, it’s a
I wonder we don’t already have music

that itselfis about party-themed mu-
sic — the self-referential dance jam,
if youwill —— and that we don’t party
while wearing T-shirts bearing clever
party-related witticisms. —

Although this scenario would be
totally meta, it would not be freakin’
awesome. Rather, the experience
might simply be a higher order,
drunken iteration of monkey—see-
monkey-do.

‘Psychology showed a similar link
between pro-social lyrics and pro-
social thoughts and behavior.

No such research has been pre-
sented correlating pro-partying lyr-
ics to an actual increase in partying

intensity or frequency. However, ’

the existing evidence indicates that
a causal link between the two is not
only plausible, but perhaps even
likely.

Considering the fervency with
which college students‘ typically
party, it’s perfectly natural to assume
that the urge is somewhat instinc-
tual, untouched by external stimuli
— entrenched in our blood, some

_ might say.

Alas, there is no known genome
correspondingto beer pong skill, nor
to an aﬂinity for bumin’ ﬁres on the

 

That said, the goal of this column certainly
wasn’t to piss on anyone’s party 

week of classes and schoolwork. It
also capitalizes on the factthat atthis
point in our lives, we do not yet have
to tend to the high-pitched timbres

of a crying infant the morning after ‘

a long night out. Partying is good.
Some might even argue that partying
is “freakin’ awesome.”

The Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta
Feeling” has been perched atop the
Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since
July 11, and no less than 23 times, its
refrain makes a dubious yet infre-
quently challenged prediction: “To—
night’s gonna be a good night.”

Although the song’s candor situ-
ates it among the most explicit illus-
trations of the current “party song”
trend, it is not unique.

Seven of the top 10 songs on the
Aug. 29 Billboard top singles chart
make direct or indirect references
to partying or alcohol. For lack of
a better historical comparison, the
chart corresponding to my ﬁrst day
of kindergarten featured only one
such song. And yes, itwas “Fantastic
Voyage” by Coolio.

Indeed, music and merriment are
a winning combination dating back

Psychology majors and laymen
alike might very well be familiar
with the concept of self-fulﬁlling
prophecy. 4

Generally, it suggests that if you
tell yourselfthat tonight’s gonna be
a good night 23 times over the course
of ﬁve minutes, you might in fact be
predisposing yourself to make it
happen. It’s a dubious theory on the

. surface, but self-fulﬁlling prophecy is

not a pseudoscientiﬁc conjecture.

Research presented by noted psy-
chologist and skeptic Richard Wise-
man in his 2003 book “The Luck Fac-
tor” indicates that when people think
positively, their subsequent actions
are actually conducive to producing
positive results.

Likewise, the effects of music
lyrics on human behavior also have
tangible support.

A 2003 study conducted by two

Iowa State University professors pre-

sented strong evidence that violent
song lyrics positively correlate to
hostile moods and actions in listen-
ers.

Another study published last Au-
gust in the journal of Eiqaerimental

Life imitates art. Just as the rise
of the television crime drama has
spawned a 32-percent increase in
undergraduate forensic science ma-
jors, music about partying makes the
whole venture all that more appeal-
ing. Our “festive” lifestyle, in many
ways, has been imposed on us cul-
turally. V

In 1999’s “Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me,” the over-
weight Scottish henchman Fat Bas-

tard whimpers, “I eat because I’m_

unhappy.

And I’m unhappy because I ea ”
This roughly approximates to the
relationship between us and party-
ing: We party because it’s cool, and
we’re cool because we party.

That said, the goal of this column
certainly wasn’t to piss on anyone’s
party — it’s Friday, after all.

All I ask is that you let tonight’s

  Grand Funk Railroadto kickoff Steelers season

“The American Band” brings the funk to the Steelers’ Kickoff and Rib Festival.

Colleen Counihan
Staff Writer

I The Pittsburgh Steelers are the

reigning champions of American
football, so-who better to open a new
season than a band that has called
itself “The American Band” since
the 1970s? *

Grand Funk Railroad will play at
the Steelers’ Kickoff and Rib Fest this
Saturday. GFR made it big almost
four decades ago, thanks to the hit
song “We’re anAmerican Band” and
a rock ’n’ roll-styleaudiences went
crazy for — catchy lyrics, big hair
and tight pants. J .

Though the band has since
changed, it still consists of two origi-
nal members — Don Brewer (drums,
leadvocals) and Mel Schacher (bass
guitar) — and they’ve kept GFR rel-
evant by playing hit songs from the
past that newer audiences want to
hear. J ‘

Brewer said he’s excited for this
particular event because he’s a Steel-
ers fan. “Ifm really a Steelers fan this

year,” he said. “Not just because
they won the Super Bowl, but I’m
completely against the Philadelphia
Eagles because of their lack of ethics

audience. We try to get the audience
involved with the show. In that re-

» spect, it’s very similar to what it’s

always been,” Brewer said.
Just as the band has aged, how-

ever, so has its core listeners, but
Brewer has noticed that they have
found popularity among a younger
generation.

 

“When we were the new hot
band, it was a completely different
reaction,” Brewer said. “We’re a lot

A older, we’re more mature, we’re a

lot better musicians, I think, but the

spirit of Grand Funk Railroad is still
the same that it has been.”

When asked about the signiﬁ-
cance of branding themselves with
the ‘?\.merican” label, Brewer offers it

as a one-word explanation of where
the band came from, why they are
famous and what they stand for as
musicians.

The band comes from a typical
American small town, Flint, Mich.,
and Brewer believes GFR’s everlast-
ing acknowledgement of this modest
identity is partly what has made the
group famous.

“We ended up ‘being the local
band that made it big. A lot of our
fans relate to us in that way. We’re
not untouchable, we’re just regular
guys,” he said.

While other big name classic rock
bands have limited their modem-
day acts to spectacles ranging from
annual VH1 showcases to tours con-
sisting of two shows in New York
City, GFR has made its live music
available to the masses.

And according to Brewer, there
are no plans to stop soon.

“It really is a treat. You can just
go out there and do what you love ——
not everyone can say that,” Brewer
said.. “We’ll continue doing it until
we can’t do it anymore.

Le vi Johnston hungry for more fame

Levi Johnston goes to any means necessary to ensure himself media attention

 
   

Kieran Layton
At-}E Editor

If a law degree is the quintessential
and most common prerequisite for
many successful politicians, what
is the most sureﬁre way to become
asuccessful famewh*re‘? I

For Levi Johnston, knocking up
the daughter of a politician was cer-
tainly astart. Posing nude in Playgirl
couldn’t hurt, either. ' V

The baby-daddy of 18-year-old

Bristol Palin, who in turn is the -

daughter of the now-infamous joke
of the 2008 presidentialelection,
Sarah Palin, Johnston has since left
Bristol to pursue other worthwhile
activities —— namely, to get himself
permanently ingrained in the public
eye.

In a series of gaudy displays of
shameless self-promotion,Johnston
is the most recent — and pathetic

— example of a D-list “celebrity”
attempting to cash in his dignity for
proﬁt. Heidi Montag and Spencer
Pratt must be so proud. .

The shenanigans started this
summer, a few months after John-

ston and Palin “mutually agreed” to .

end their engagement, as reported
by the Associated Press. Johnston
began a round of major news net-
work interviews and talk show ap-

pearances — my favorite being “The

Tyra Banks Show” —— with the seem-
ingly preeminent motive of embar-
rassing the Palins.

Leave it to Banks to deem the ap-
parently accidental conception of
Levi and Bristol’s son as a “wardrobe
malfunction.”

When he wasn’t getting creep-
ily affectionate pats on the leg from
'I‘yra, Johnston found time to do a
large feature in GQ magazine, where
he posed shirtless with an infant that
was certainly not his. _

While the magazine subversively

poked  at his Alaskan-bred excess

of masculinity and Republicanism, it .
‘ also unfortunately set upjohnston to

become a household name.
Then,Johnston agreed to attend

the Teen Choice Awards. Not with

a rising pop starlet, mind you, but

on the arm of self—proclaimed D-list -

diva Kathy Griﬂin. Across the coun-
try, confused spectators to this most
freakish of media circuses echoed,
“Levi, I’ve got a feeling we’re not in
Alaska anymore. We must be over
the shame—bow!”

' Between the bouts of photo-
graphed shirtlessness and cavorting
around with one of the biggest gay
icons out there,Johnston cemented
his image as anew poster boy for the
gay community by doing a Skype
interview on Bravo’s “Watch What
Happens Live” with host Andy Co-
hen.

As if his association with Grif-
ﬁn wasn’t enough, appearing on
what is commonly thought of as

the unspoken gay cable channel has
transformedjohnston into a gay icon
himself.

V And as the cherry on top of an
already VH1 reality show—worthy
set of surreal events, Johnston said
he would be willing to pose nude “if
the money was right.”

To catch up, one year ago John-
ston was just another pawn in the
McCain/Palin campaign ticket. To-
day, he is in negotiations to strip
down for Playgirl.

One almost has to feel bad for the
Palin family — almost — for being
associated with what is simultane-
ously the joke and current prize of

. the media world.

Johnston, who must secretly be
loving his gay fan base, is playing
all the right cards, even though he
might be cashing in too soon.

His most garish move yet —— a
self—written account in Vanity Fair
on the nature of Sarah Palinas politi-
cian, wife and mother — is the most

logical attention-getting move, but
after the buzz wears off from the ar-
ticle, what other plays doesJohnston
have in his arsenal? ‘

The upcoming strip shoot
couldn’t hurt, but ultimately, the
Alaskan good-ole~boy will inevi-
tably ﬁnd himself on the path to
increasingly shameful, yet always
public, attempts to stay relevant. A
memoir will surely pop up some-
day, and maybe a drug scandal will
shake things up. Ifjohnston gets re-
ally lucky, perhaps Miley Cyrus will
hit him up after “Hannah Montana”
gets canceled.

For now, though, let’s mourn yet
another case where a fame-hungry
subject — previously on the edge
of the spotlight — sells his soul for
a little more attention, despite his
plethora of real responsibilities like
raising a child.

Levi has spoken, Sarah Palin. It
might be time to get in touch with
Playboy.

ln—state recruits still afocal point for Wannstedt I

One of Wannstedt’s most fruit-

on making Pitt a contender for
top local talent. Despite Pitt’s
5-6 record in 2005, the recruit-

Panthers young, but picked to win Big East

After losing LeSean McCoy, Scott McKillop and others, Pitt turns to freshmen starters at a few positions in the season’s first game‘

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

The 2009 Pitt football team takes
to Heinz Field tomorrow coming
off its most successful season un-
der coach Dave Wannstedt. Last
year’s team ﬁnished tied for sec-
ond in the Big East with a 9-3 over-
all record before falling to Oregon,

3-0, in the Sun Bowl.

But last season is over and the
football team is ready for this
year when the Panthers host the
Youngstown State Penguins to-
morrow at 1 p.m.

And for the man who knows the
players the best, they’re ready for
this season.

“I would just start off by saying
that I know our players, our staff,

everyone involved with this pro-
gram, our fans are all excited about
getting this season kicked off,”
Wannstedt said at his ﬁrst weekly
press conference of the year.

This year’s team was picked
by Big East coaches to ﬁnish atop
the conference —— but it wasn’t
unanimous, and the battle for the
best team is expected to be a hard
fought one.

There is no LeSean McCoy and
there is no Scott McKillop — All-
Big East ﬁrst team selections in
2008 — but that doesn’t worry
the coaching staff.

This year’s team is younger,
but has quickly grasped how the
program is run.

That’s good news as the future
of Pitt football will soon learn what
it takes to win.

13

‘ .

True freshmen Dion Lewis and
Ray Graham will replace McCoy,
who left Pitt early to enter the NFL
after last season.

While starting such a young
player at such an important posi-
tion might not be the most ideal
situation, the coaching staff knows
the best players — regardless of
age and- experience — will be
starting.

New offensive coordinator Frank

in the vicinity ofBaldwin, and he jumps
to make the catch. Pitt tried this play

with more screens being called from

a lot of different formations.

But, Cignetti said he’s been told not
to complicate things when planningto
use Baldwin.

“I’ve heard a couple guys on the
South Side that say, ‘Hey, don’t forget
that play to No. 82l”’ Cignetti said with
a laugh.

What he’s most likely referring to
is the fade route —— the play where a
quarterback throws the ball anywhere

N otre Dame.

The third jump was converted for
the touchdown.

“I’m working hard on running
routes, and coach Cignetti has some
ideas to get me more involved,” Bald-
win said.

Speciﬁcally, Cignetti wants to put
Baldwin in good positions to make
plays.

“When you throw the ball, you’d
likejonathan to be somewhere in the

progression where he’s either at the
point of attack orthe secondary read,”
Cignetti said. “Or, if he’s not part of
the progression, he’s on the back side
where if he’s one—on-one, the quar-
terback has the opportunity to give
him the ball.”

Baldwin said Cignetti has a lot
of tricks and strategies to move him
around the ﬁeld.

“It’s the screens and other things,
whether it’s those or reverses, it’s the
ability to get him a quick touch and
see what he can do with it,” Cignetti
said.

In Cignetti’s system, the running
game is the primary weapon, but
thanks to Baldwin’s hard work, he is
quickly becoming a favorite target in
practice.

It was rare when one Pitt practice
went by this summer when Baldwin
didn’t make a spectacular catch or
play-

Cignetti realizes that the best way
to start the passing game is through
Baldwin.

“It’s just smart coaching,” he
said.

Panthers’ play needs
to back up predictions

Wannstedt 4 12

brilliance, like beating then—No.
10 South Florida on the road and
moments of underachievement,
such as losing to Bowling Green
to open the season.

The end result was a 9-4 re-
cord, Wannstedt’s first winning
season.

Earlier this week, Wannstedt
was asked whether this team re-
sembled the squad that he imag-
ined he would have going into his
ﬁfth season.

He said the team is “pretty
close” to what he envisioned.

“We’ve got a good group of
guys,” Wannstedt said. “We’ve
got guys that are committed,
and they’re all here to win, and
they’re here to do it the right way.
That’s what you try to assemble
as a coach.”

As for the hype around the
team and Pitt’s preseason po-
sition as the Big East favorite,
Wannstedt knows his team must

justify the attention it’s receiv-
ing by performing on the ﬁeld,
starting with tomorrow’s game
against Youngstown State.

“This time of year, it’s all just
talk. [Media members] have to
pick top-teams, and they have to
talk about different positions and
individuals, but that’s the great
thing about this game,” he said.
“You have to go out there and
prove yourself.”

Indeed, results are critical at
this period in Wannstedt’s tenure.
Lauded recruiting classes and
promises of a brighter tomorrow
no longer seem satisfactory.

Four years ago, Youngstown
State provided Wannstedt with
his first victory as a collegiate
head coach. .

If Wannstedt has guided Pitt’s
football program to where it needs
to be, this season Youngstown
State should be Pitt’s first win on
its way to a BCS bowl game.

Mason competes for
starting linebacker

The freshman surprises with good play at camp

Panthers 4 13

,_ “You would like not to be in
that scenario [of playing fresh-
men], but at the same time, these
two kids came out of camp and
had the most productive camps,”
Wannstedt said. “You want to play
the best players that give you the
best chance to win.”

Lewis and Graham aren’t the
only the true freshmen expected to
play this season. Middle linebacker
Dan Mason, listed as Adam Gunn’s
backup on the depth chart, showed

Qonsistency and power throughout
training camp.

For Wannstedt, typically a
coach with much to say about his
players, few were needed to de-
scribe Mason’s play this early into
his college career.

“He’s the real deal,” he said
simply.

No other freshmen are expect-
ed to play much this season, and
Wannstedt hopes to redshirt any

freshmen who doesn’t play — but
that’s not always possible because
of injuries.

Heading into the season opener,
redshirt senior Bill Stull will again
be the starting quarterback. But
Wannstedt hinted that his backup,
redshirt freshman Tino Sunseri,
will still play a lot this year.

“We want to get him in as many
games as we can,” Wannstedt said.
“We’ll take it one week at a time.”

Stull threw for 2,356 yards, nine
touchdowns and 10 interceptions
in 12 regular season games last sea-
son. Sunseri, as a redshirt, did not
play in a game in 2008 but showed
the ability to play the position well
during training camp.

With Stull as the starter, the
Panthers are hoping to not have a
repeat of last season’s opener. In
2008, Bowling Green upset then-
ranked No. 25 Pitt, 27-17, at Heinz
Field. Mistakes and turnovers

Wannstedt has focused on recruiting players from within Pennsylvania to play for the Panthers.

plagued the Panthers, who were
never able to control the visiting
Falcons.
Wannstedt
knows what

went wrong
last year and
knows his team
isn’t going to
take the Pen-
guins lightly.
““We’ve got

 

to go out there and protect the
football and we need to tackle,” he
said. “If you do those things, you’re
going to have a chance to win ev-
ery week, whether it’s Youngstown
State or West Virginia. That’s the
key.”

This is just the second time that
Pitt will play Youngstown State. In
2005, the Panthers defeated the
Penguins 41-0.

Youngstown State, a member of

the College Football Subdivision,
FCS, is one of the more success-
ful subdivision teams. It won four
national championships during
the 1990s.

After playing the Penguins, Pitt
will travel to Buffalo for a game
against the Bulls on Sept. 12.

The Panthers don’t begin Big
East play until their Oct. 2 matchu
at Louisville. c
