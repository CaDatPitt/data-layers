Plans are being completed‘ for

a full week of live, professional’ 

style. politicking on campus.
Planned for the school week of
Oct. 27-31, just before the national

general elections, the week will; 

feature rallies by the two campus
political clubs, speeches by big

name politicians, and as a climax,

a mock election. 

Idea for the week originated
during the summer with members
of the YM and YWCA’s
Town lvleeting.” The “Y” is of-
ficially sponsoring the week.

Democracy in Action

A steering committee, - headed
by “Town Meeting” president Joe
Trattner, and, composed of rep-
resentatives of various campus
organizations, the ‘ ofilces of the
deans of men and women, and the
YM and YWCA, met last week to
set the wheels in motion.i

Ross Reese, president of the
Young Democrats, and Dan Purdy,
Young Republican head, agreed to
support the project.

Conferred With Leaders

During the past few xweeks
Trattner said he has conferred
with some of the leaders of both

political parties at their down-~'

town ' headquarters, including
Democratic State Senator Joseph
Barr, Sheriff Thomas J. Whitten,
who heads the local Republican
campaign, and Democrat John P.
Robin, chairman of the Urban Re-
development Authority.

All of them, said Trattner, gave
their full approval to the week and
its activities, and said they would
do their best to bring big name
speakers, one from each party, to ‘
make speeches here. Their names,»
however, will not be announced
for several weeks, Trattner add-
ed. "

A prospectus of Political Week
has been compiled by.the ‘‘Town'
Meeting” committee, and mimeo- '
graphed copies will be ready for

distribution to students _in a few -A V

days, Trattner said.
Events Scheduled

The schedule of events for the’
week as given in the prospectus,
is, in brief, this:

God As Much
As Students Do

By CLARK SUTTON

Billy ‘Graham comes to Pitt A

Friday, and from the stage of
Stephen Foster Memorial his
powerful voice will ring out
with his own answers “to the
present world dilemma and a plea
for a spiritual and moral_ renais-
sance.” ~
(Billy.Graham will speak at
Stephen Foster Memorial, Fri-
day, Sept. 26, at 12:45 under the
auspices of the‘ Canterbury
Club.)

preaching has attracted tens of

fended students from critics who

moral group in the country.
“They. are confused and be-
wildered.” Tensely leaning for-
,ward in ‘his chair and speaking
forcefully, he said, “But more and

that God, not man, has the only
answer to the three great prob-
lems of the world.”

. l\Ian’s Problems

These three problems are, “hu-
man. depravity, human sorrow,
and death and students are be-
.ginning to reject the solutions of-
fered by the great, golden social
programs taught by man,” he said.
“Jesus Christ gave the answers to
these problems, and we can have
the peace of mind that comes with
the solution by accepting these an-
swers on faith alone.”

“This program being taught stu-
dents says that changing society
ﬁrst will then change the individ-
ual.” -He clenched his ﬁst and
pounded it in his palm. “But Jesus
Christ‘says change the individual
ﬁrst andwthat will change society.
And Jesus’ laid down his program
for man to follow in His Sermon
on the Mount.” He leaned back in
his chair and relaxed.

EVANGELIST I

ItVlE‘WED—Billy Graham, the noted evangelist

 

   

now holding forth at Hunt Armory and Forbes Field, will speak at
Foster Memorial, Friday, Sept. 26. In a recent interview with a
Pitt News editor, Graham outlined the problems of man and his

solution to them.

and an intimate knowledge of!
present day problems which comes

from his friendships with many

of the notable people of the west-

ern world. He quotes them fre-

quentlytto illustrate his ideas.

Sincere in appearance, he states
with no embarrassment his re-
liance on God to save this coun-
try “from eventual destruction.”
It’s your privilege to accept or ‘re-
ject this view, but that’s what
Jesus said, and .I believe Him,” he
said.

Sincere In Beliefs

When he was asked to answer
his critics who say that what he
preaches isn’t enough in itself to
save the world, Graham again
tensed himself forward and struck
out with his right hand. “I do not
advocate rejection of science and
all other learning, but, my friend,
your expert knowledge on labor
problems, economics, or science is
useless without ﬁrst accepting
Jesus Christ.”

As one student said, “You might
not agree with what he says, but
he, at least, has offered a way
out.”

Transfers

Men’s Council has taken under
its paternal wings those whom the
regular freshman orientation does
not cover. These include the
transfer student, the vet starting
school for the ﬁrst time, and those
whose schooling was interrupted
by a hitch in service.

i A voluntary orientation pro-
gram, planned by Morton Gold-
stein, will introduce these students
to Pitt.

Bob Block, junior representative
to Men’s Council, will conduct the
following meetings, scheduled for
81_7 Cl.

Sept. 25, 10:30 a.m.—Richard
Cunningham, assistant to the dean
of'men, will speak on facilities of

man, assistant to the dean of men,
will relate the history of Pitt.

Oct. 8, 2:30 p.m.—-Paul Sher-
wood, assistant to the dean of men
will explain the placement of
graduates. and undergraduates in
availableavailable jobs.

.Those students who never par-
ticipated in an orientation pro-
gram are also invited to the meet-
ings.

late last week. _

Rev. Murray, Minister of the
First Unitarian Church, claimed
that the “waving of a religious
wand can’t change people’s char-
acter and behavior” and that the
creed of the revivalist “runs
roughshod over two-thirds of
what we have learned from mod-
ern pyschology and pyschiatry.”

Bible Not Soliltion

Rev. Murray, an active ﬁgure
for many years in local affairs,
’said college students could solve
the problems that face them, “not
by reading the Bible, but by

- thinking.” .

A“I would like‘ the“'revivalist,”
Rev. Murray continued, “to task
young people to think through the
implications of civil liberties and
civil rights. The evangelist should
talk more. Let him answer ques-
tions about where he.stands as to
these things—discriminatory clubs,
equal job opportunities, collective
security and world order.” .

Forecasts Harm by Unskilled ’

In his attack upon the kind of
religion set forth by the revival-
ist, Rev. Murray also hit the _po-
tential “harm” that could be done
by unskilled people. He did not,
however, speciﬁcally mention Billy
Graham, an evangelist now con-
ducting meetings in the Pittsburgh
area

Rev. Murray said that the
audience at a revival meeting
was composed. largely of guilt
stricken people. “The revival-
ist,” said Rev. Murray, “offers
an easy way out—walk three
hundred feet to salvation.”

“A great many of these guilt
feelings are unnecessary. We
should play them down, not up,
and ﬁnd out the root of the of-
fense. Revivalists don’t help peo-
ple any, preaching in the middle
of ballparks.”

“We can cure people by letting

“College students can’t ﬁnd prescriptions in the Bible
as to what to do now” ‘from “tub-thumpers for Christ,” as-
serted Rev. Irving Murray in an interview with the News

themgget a profound insight into
human behavior . . . people who
are trained by pyschiatrists and
pyschologists can help instead of
those trained by Bible salesmen.”
“The evangelistic religion,”
Rev. Murray said, “reduces the
Bible to meaningless jhodge-
- podge. The Bible read critically
in the light of what study has
taught, is a great adventure of
the human spirit in the e_om--
pany of the divine; but the Bible
read as the revisionalist reads
it, as revealed truth dictated by
God to human stenographers, is
not only a fanciful story but a
dull-one as well.”

A This year, the planners "of the annual all—student trip
.7‘: to an away-from-home football game made_sure that the
project doesn’t flop, as it did last time”, For the Pitt-Michi-
 gan game last year a train was to be: chartered. But trains
3 being what they are, the railroad_ company can’t afford
to put one on the rails unless a large ‘number of paid ‘seats,
in last year’s. case, over 300, are guaranteed. As it turned
out, only about 200 signed up, so nobody went.

For the journey to~West*Point this year busses will
be hired,‘= and any group of 36 students (a bus load) that
‘decides to go will have a guarantee of getting there‘. The
bus company places no minimum requirement. on the num-
ber of paid seats, except that any one bus must be full.‘

The schedule calls forlthe‘ busses to leave Pittsburgh

about 9 a.m. the next day. You will -have almost half a
day before the game to see West Point. Then, see the game,
:. andhave six hours afterwards to spend in the big city.
-T-hebusses leave for Pittsburgh about midnight Satur-
day, get in: here at 11 a.m. Sunday, in“ time for church!
All for the price of only $16.60!

_.So you getyour ticket at the Student Desk now! It’s
an adventure you can’t afford to miss! 1.

   l augliing Matter  

' City council’s motion to table action on the University’s
live panthers is a slur to the members of Alpha Phi Omega,
the service’ fraternity responsible for the project, and‘ the

’ students who have contributed to the fund to buy the
-animals. -

-The astute members of the council have argued for
weeks over the problem. Some think it is dangerous to the
spectators; some think the animals will suffer if ‘put-on.
public exhibition in rolling cages; others saw ﬁt to pro-
’mote' such ideas as pulling the Panthers’ teeth so that they

, .couldn’t harm the spectators if they got loose. Another’
‘ suggested that live animals would ‘replace the present stu-
dent in apanther suit, thus adding to the unemployed
. students. ‘ « ’

Such remarks are indicative of confusion and lack of
knowledge of the subject. Perhaps if the council members
would actually study the problem, confer with the Highland -1

‘Park Zoo officials, Alpha Phi Omega, and-University repre-
 sentatives, and take a _more serious attitude toward-the
.‘question, a reasonable solution could be worked out.

We hope so. . ‘

Billy Graham, thenoted evan-
gelist, -who speaksin Stephen
Foster Memorial this Friday,
once predicted to a reporter that
his crusade would effect a great
social change in the city.

The hundred or so converts
who troop up
each night to
”surrender to
Christ,” he.
said , we re
proof of the

_ e ffectiveness
ofehis method.

_We hold]
this to be an
overstatement,
and maintain
that if Billy
really had his
ﬁnger on the city’s pulse, he
would realize that what happens
each night at his services has
been happening dozens of times
every day throughout the town
long before he came here.

Results ‘Differ'en'|'

And the results have been far
from what Billy suspects.

As proof ‘we offer the follow-
ing tale, certiﬁed‘ to be abso-
lutely true in every respect:

The salesman straightened his
tie and knocked at the door. The
housewife, who happened to'be
scrubbing the kitchen floor, got
up carefully, rubbed her knees,
pushed at her hair-do, and went
to answer the knock, glad of the
chance to.relieve‘the monotony
of the inorning.

There was the salesman, his

The Ivy "League colleges, ‘especially the big
three Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, have always
‘been notedfor their long histories and their ﬁne

academic traditions. ‘

‘ given for the desire of America’s y_oung men to get

degrees from these institutions. .

John Hershey, Yale ’36, and author of the best-

seller, The Wall, in the Septem-
ber issue ’of Harper’s magazine
made, one reason amply clear.
Going to Yale pays. In an ar-
ticle entitled “Yale No. 36—Look
at'Them Now.” He reveals that
the median earned income, be
fore taxes, of’ a graduate of the
classof _1936 was $9,392 a year.
Median is the ﬁgure right in the
middle of all the incomes re-

corded. That is one—half of the Yale graduates made
over $9,392 and one-half made under that ﬁgure.
On, top of this Yale ’36 graduates had -an unearned

income of $5,190 a year.

9 Hershey compares these ﬁgures with those
published last year in _a book entitled They ‘Went
to College by Ernest Havemann and Patricia Salt-
er West. According to this book the bigthree had
in 1947 a median gross income of $7,365. The medi-
an income fro mother _Ivy League campuses (Co-
lumbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Pennsylvania)

was reported as $6,142.‘

‘Tech Income Good
The median from 17 technical schools includ-
.ing Carnegie Tech was $5,382; from twenty higher

intense look of friendliness and
self-conﬁdence on his _face. He

found out in short order what‘
the woman had been doing, so
he talked up his scrub brush.
Magnificent ‘Brush

It was, according to him, a
really magniﬁcent brush. He got
out achart which showed how
the super-stiff nylon bristles sci-
entiﬁcally dug dirt out of the
microscopic crevices in the floor.
He indicated on the chart ,as pic-
ture of a goateed doctor in a
white coat and a scientiﬁc frown
on his face recommending the
cleanliness" the brush achieved.

He said how beautifully easy
it was to scrub a floor with the
brush. He cited six lovely movie
stars and the wives of three past
presidents of the  who swore
by the brush. _

The salesman saw the house-
wife was beginning to crack, and
he poured on the coal. He be-
came emotional and pleaded with
her, for her sake, to buy one. He
told her it was the only way she
could be saved from the hell—on—
earth of a kitchen with eternally
dirty ﬂoors. He raised his arms to
the sky and describedin a quiv-
ering voice the unbelievable hap-
piness of other housewives who

. used the brush. He strode dra-

matically back and forth on the
stoop, denouncing the miserable
sinfulness of people with dirty
ﬂoors, and ended up with“ one

to wonder about that salesman. "

Also about the brush. She found

that she had to scrub just_‘as»

hard to get the dirt off. Her back
and arms got tired, too, and her
knees were as sore as ever.

Doubt turned to disappoint-
ment, then to irritation.

When she cooled off the house‘-

man’s intense sincerity, his

his glowing word—pictures of the
happiness it could bring were

than any other. ‘

It was, in fact, just another

Harriers in Practice Runs

With only ten days remaining before the “opening meet with

Westminster, Pitt’s cross-country team is working hard to get in

shape for its long hauls.

Coach‘ Carl Olson has been running -his harriers over the four .

and a half mile Schenley Park course—the Panthers’ home course.

looked Very impressive.
. Both boys ran the course in

Olson their time is “better than

riers through their paces on Fri-
, day, Oct. 3, in the ‘first home

’ gives the Panthers quite a hectic

Olson, however, agreed to the
consecutive matches because he
ﬁgures the team needs more con-

. its ten-meet schedule. ~
. One thing is certain, though,
‘Olson has not decided on a ﬁnal
roster. Anyone interested in try-

Soph Battles Hoffman

For Starting Position

. By RUSS

The Windup of pre—season drills ﬁnds the left halfback
‘job still a matter of contention between sophomores Bill

Hoffman and Johnny Jacobs, one of whom will start in the " 

opener against Iowa Saturday at the Stadium.

Hoffman, a good passer, started out last spring as the
likely candidate for the spot in the absence of Lou Cimarolli,
last year’s leading ground gainer. But he has been pressed

in fall drills ‘by the hard-working¢

Jacobs, a 5-11, 195—pounder, con-
sidered the fastest man on the
squad.

Meanwhile, two more transfer

, line.

Transfers Make Squad

Bill Cessar, 6-2, .205-pound
tackle who spent a short time at
South Carolina before transferring
here a year and a half ago, will be
called upon for defensive duty,
along with ’ Guard Dick Gatz, a
6-0, 190—pounde_r.

Gatz performed at fullback and
quarterback at Kansas for a sea-
songebefore entering Pitt last year.

Rough Stuﬁ Over

The good right arm of Quarter-
back Rudy Mattioli, a transfer
from Kentucky, has gained for
him the inside track on ball-
handling chores for the opener.

Yesterday marked the ﬁnal ses-
sion of rough scrimmage in .prep-
aration for Saturday’s clash
against the Hawkeyes.

wvu's Bisichoff
Haled as 't' ’

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

  

West Virginia University has an All-American football
candidate this year in Paul Bischoff. So does Pitt in Captain
Joe Schmidt. The difference, however, is that the Mounties
have advertised their product. Schmidt remains an unknown
to many of those who haven’t seen him perform.

An All-American prospect today needs a good publicity

agent to blab sweet nothings
to everyone. .His Saturday
afternoon performances will
only reafﬁrm what publicity
already has built up over the
spring and summer.

Bischoff,’ a senior end
pushed skyward like a mod-
ern teevee Captain ‘Video or
Jack Armstrong.

_Publicity from Morgantown proﬁles his football abili-
ty with superlatives and more superlatives. They nom-
inate the blondhusky for football. immortality.

Something Called ‘It’

“The best pass—receiver, tackler, blocker, .and pass-de-

 

fender, as smart, and as good a runner as anybody on the E

squad.” This descriptive sentence, to say the least, ‘opens
WVU’s bid to All-Americanize Bischoif. There’s more, too,
in the brochure printed for press and radio. I

“This 6-1, 190-pound pass-snagging paragon is exception-
ally gifted with coordination and timing, sure hands, speed,
and powerful knee action, a knack for football and that in-

tangible something called ‘IT’.”

“He pulls the spectacular and makes it look easy. Catch-

‘ ingva pass on his shoetops or three feet over his head on

the dead run are natural for him.”

Half An All-American

Despite all the praise West Virginia has showered on
Biscphoff they may-have to settle for half an All-American.
According to training camp reports Coach Art Lewis plans
to use Bischoff only on offense.

In this case, his greatness will be cut in half. His knack
for tackling, pass—defendi_ng, and “thatintangible something
called “IT” will go unnoticed.

Three games have been carded

fall «but local gridfans will only

have one look at the yearlings in

games include an engagement with

At present, however, Coaches
Steve Petro and Edgar Jones are
drilling their squad with the var-
sity in preparation for Saturday’s
home opener with Iowa.

The T—minded Cubs have been
running single—wing plays at the
varsity defensive unit, shelving
their own offensive attack tem-
porarily. They return to the T

formation for the rest of the sea-
son since Iowa is the only Pitt foe
that uses the single—wing.

Last year, the frosh merged

with the jayvee squad to increase
their manpower since freshman
were eligible for varsity compe-
tition. This fall, though, the Cubs

will be at full strength but the

jayvee ‘squad has been abolished,
at least for this campaign.

Meanwhile, in their only scrim-
mage to date off the Pitt campus
the Cubs failed to impress the
fresh coaches. They were success-
ful, edging Carnegie Tech’s»var-
sity, but as Petro put it, “They
were awful sloppy and need quite
a bit of polish.”

Jones leaves his coaching du-
ties Friday to scout Oklahoma in
its game‘ with Colorado.
