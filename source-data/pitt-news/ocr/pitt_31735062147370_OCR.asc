With Prize Offer

 

’Free Trip To California Game

To Be Awarded To Winner
In Associa.tion’s Drive

 

Launched with a talk and prize an-,

nouncement, the 1935-36 membership
drive of the General Alumni Associa-
tion promises to be one of the most
successful in recent years.

Meeting in the Cathedral last even-
_ing, approximately 125 class secre-
taries learned of the reward which
will go to the contestant in the mem-
bership contest who obtains the larg-

Vest number of new members for the

Alumni Association.

The prize will be a ten-day, all-ex-
pense trip to the Pitt-Southern Cali-
fornia football game in Los Angeles
on December 14,- with the oﬁicial
alumni tour. Included in the expenses
to be taken care of, by the alumni
will be ﬁrst-class railroad transporta-
tion from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles
and return, with lower berth Pullman
accommodations and meals en route.
In Los Angeles the winner will be
given a room for three nights in the
Biltmore Hotel and a seat on the 50-
yard line forthe game. In addition,
aside trip to the Grand Canyon will
be offered, including meals and sight-
seeing.

Norman MacLeod, BA17, chairman
the membership ‘committee of
Alumni Council, presided at th.eVmeet-
ing and introduced Dr. John B. Suth-
fgland, head V‘ football coach,V who in
turn addressed the group; '

Speaking on the value of teamwork
in putting over an alumni program,
Dr. Sutherland said, “If only 20 per
cent of the 50,000 ‘graduates and
former students of this University
were to get back of the constructive
program "of the General Alumni As-
sociation, there is no limit to the pos-
sibilities of such a united group.”

Striking the keynote of his address,
the Pitt football mentor, metaphored
in football parlance, “No individual
needs to be the star player if we can
have proper teamwork.”

Any member of the General Alumni

Association in good standing who is‘

registered as a contestant may com-
pete, except oﬂicers of the Associa-
tion, members of the Alumni Council,
and members of the alumni headquar-
ters staff. V V AV V

Playwriting Help
- Offered Students

Gerber, Cass win Griticize Drafts
Of Original One-Act Dramas

Authors and would-be authors of
one-act plays will be assisted in writ-
ing and marketing their work under
a new plan‘ proposed by. Carl B. Cass,
asistant professor of English, and
John C. Gerber, instructor in English.

According to Mr. Cass, “There has
recently grownup a ready market for
good one-act plays. Magazines of the
theater _;are- offering large sums for-

publicationfrights alone, and oppor-.

tunities are always. open for produc-
tion of new dramas.” ‘

Inasmuch as the University does
not ’offer a‘ course in one-act play
writiiig, Mr." Cass,V’_direVc_tor "of Pitt.
Players, and Mr. Gerber, faculty ad-
viser of Quill Club, have decided to
aid students interested in the ﬁeld.‘ V '

Undergraduates with ideas, {partly-
completed manuscripts, 'orV ﬁnished
plays are invited to consult with the
men. Both the teachers assure stu-
dents that good work will receive
ready consideration and that a. market
will be found for outstanding produci-
tions. V VV "

V In addition to the national _openings
available, there is also the local
Players group, which during the year
produces ‘many one-act" shows. Stu-
dent-Vwritten plays for such entertain-I
ments will be welcomed by the class
in play ’prod,u_ct,ion. ' ' A

Plan Throughout Year V

   

Eduipped with. their high school

personal snapshots,‘ freshi_nanVmen will
meet their faculty "advisers for the
ﬁrst time on Friday at 12:30 o'clock.
Dr. Omar C. i'Held, personal assist-
ant to the dean of the College,Vfeels
that freshmen needthe advice and
personal contact of their faculty ad-
visers more in their freshman year
than "at any other time during their
college career. ' _
To support his contention, Dr. Held

these contacts :V at the end of theﬁrst
eight weeks," when the ﬁrst ‘reports
appear; at the close of the semester,
when semester blueprints aDP.e9__,r‘;' and
in the spring, when course cards are
issued. ‘P V " “ V "V

“‘W_e have tried, whenever possible,”
Dr. Held stated, "‘to assign freshmen
to members of the faculty, "whom they
have in class. In fully 75 per “cent
of the cases, we have succeeded, al-
though we limit each faculty mem-
ber to 15 men or less.’’ ‘

“In view of the fact that the fresh-

orientation instructors on numerous
occasions," Dr. Held continued, “we
do not feel it is necessary to have
them meet specially at this time.”

The meeting on {Friday will be a
general one between faculty advisers
and all the advisees. Later‘ in the
semester individual meetings will be
held. V V V

The College office will notify, by
mail, all freshman men of the time
and place of their meetings as well as
their advisers. Dr. Held urges all
freshman men to attend this important

Freshmen Take
Customs Quizzes

Herald Asks Cooperation During
“Test Year’? Of Project

“The marked increase in the num-
ber of freshman men out for activi-
ties may, I believe, be attributed di-
rectly to the interest and spirit cre-
ated by the men’s customs program,”
stated Charles Herald, C36, chairman
of the customs committee, yesterday.

“The customs program,” Herald
continued, “is just entering its second
lap. We have much more to do, but
we believe "that we will succeed in
our main purpose, the increase in Pitt
spirit.” V V V V V

Activities heads bore out Herald's
contention that student participation
has increased this year. The Pitt
News and the Panther "each showed
an increase of more than '50 per cent
in new candidates, and "while the Owl
showed a huge drop, Pitt. Players and
the Debating Association have both
reported substantial increases. V

Tests are being given all this week
in the men’s orientation classes, with
-those successful in passing receiving
bronzebuttons toreplace their green
ones. These tests are substantially
the sanie as those given to the fresh-
man women, and include questions
on University history, school songs
and cheers, faculty organization, and
activities. ' V ’ ’ . ‘ V

Dr. Bowm,an Visions Commons Room

As Hub  Varied University Activity

 

By Eugene Burkhart

Although the _Commons Room of the
Cathedral is as yet unﬁnished and
presentsmai picture of gray grandeur
to the" eye, in the mind of'Dr. John G.
Bowman, .ch'an'c‘el1oi‘ "of the Univer-
sity, it is as -.c,_1,ear,ly ,d_eﬁ_n,efd as though
it w_ere.an actual reality.

The ﬁnished room, when present
plans are carried to completion, will
be a room where many University
functions may be held; where stone-
pictures, chiseled into the walls, will
tell the story of Pennsylvania s_o

graphically that none will be able to’

leave without a deep realization that
Pennsylvania is truly a great state,
with natural history secoiid to that of
no other state of the Union.

These stone-pictures will cover the
walls, and portray accurately the
phases of plant and animal life pecu-
liar to our state. They will represent
art as well as labor; music will be in
a leading position, but so will the

sinking of the ﬁrst oil well, a Penn-
sylvania achievement.

The "ﬁnished room will be lighted
in the manner thatﬁwill best empha-
size the oeauty of the Gothic arch,
with bright lights fading into dimness
towards the ceiling.’ A model of the

. type of arch to be used is now al-

tached to a wall of the Commons
Room. Teclinicallyknown as a 60-
degree Gothic arch, it is ar_cliitectur-
ally one of the most beautiful forms
of human expression. As Dr. Bowman
pointed out, it combines into concrete
lines, the mysticism of "romance, of
human adventure and aspirations.

But, though plans are, deﬁnite, the
Commons Room must remain unﬁn-
islied, awaiting the honor that some-
day it will command. ’ ‘

Dr. Bowman countered a reporter's
question as to when the room would
be ﬁliished by asking when the de-
pression would be over. And there
you have it.

The series of lunches, dinners, smokers, dances,
and picture shows took more than a little out of

normal chatter of fraternity‘ dormitories has not
returned._ .Silen'ce week, it appears, has nicked

' even the 'Greeks':a little. ~ -

‘ a week from today.

' Ed36. -

Among some of the fraternity men there is com-
ing a--touch of wonderment about-the practicability

‘ I; of -the ten-day rushing season. Could‘ the time of
- this ~‘,‘Little Freshman Heaven” be shortened and_
still accomplishthe desired ends?

Does a man
have a better idea of the" whole set-up on the tenth
day than‘ he does on the‘ fourth or ﬁfth? These are
a couple’_ of bothering questions.

Records show that ‘few men examine more than
three of the 13 social houses. With three sched-
uled events a’ day at each house, the man can ro-

tate lunch, dinner, and evening dates for three
days to get a line on the fraternities in which he is
interested. The fourth and ﬁfth days could be
spent in checking on the favorites.

Under the present system the rushee seldom at-
tends more than four events at.his future social
“home.” Schoolwork, family, and routine de-
mands all tend to distract the focus of attention
during the longer period.

It must, of course, be considered that hasty de-
cisions are not always the best, but it is doubtful
if a freshman can analyze the situation better in
ten--days than he could in ﬁve. It must also be con-
sidered that the larger houses, which are more at-'
tractive _to rusliees on the ﬁrst days of the spirited
season, might acquire an unfair advantage over.
the smaller houses which must wait several days
before entertaining some of the boys.

It just may be possible that ten days is too much
for such hectic activity. This might prove to be a
clue as to why the all-fraternity scholastic average
rests a_fraction under the all-men’s average. Per-
l1aps‘th'e-“Grreelei has-two strikes called on him be-
fore even stepping into the batter’s box. ‘ ‘

At any rate, it ’s an idea. for the fraternity boys
to ponder over on some of these long winter even-
ings-.when the radio becomes a. triﬂe tedious.

Injuries To Panther Ends, Tackles Hurt Team’s Chances;
Notre Dame Eleven Strongest In Recent Years

The practice ﬁeld lights and "Trainer

football team in shape for the com-

Notre Dame eleven next Saturday aft-

Although the 24-6 score indicated
too much Parither prowling for the

will be inshape to face the Green-
shirts. Shaw may draw one of the
starting assignments on Saturday.
Souchak and McNish are the other
ends who -have been daily visitors to
Dr. Moore's headquarters in the Sta-
dium.

The apparent jinx which seems to
be hovering around «end ;players has
caused Coach Sutherland -to~‘~‘shi‘ft
Henry Adams, sophomore, fromcen:
ter to end. A Adams gained a little ex-
perience at his new job last Saturday
when he went in at right\end.

VVhen the Panther mentor forgets
about his end worries, he can start
with the tackles. Both Daniell and
Delich are bothered with injuries,
Daniell’s keeping him out of the game
last week." Delich, inactive for the
VV & J clash, returned to gridiron'war-
fare against the Mountaineers for a
few minutes in the secondhalf. Art
Detizel a.nd Tony Matisi will probably
be found at the tackle posts when the
Panthers run out on the ﬁeld next
Saturday.

A tentative starting lineup for the
locals would include Souchak and
Shaw at ends; Matisi and Detzel at
tackles; Glassford and Dalle Tezze at
guards; and Kliskey at center. Of
those seven mentioned only three have
ever faced a Notre Dame eleven, those
being Detzel, Glassford, and Kliskey.

In the backfield the situation ap-
pears to be slightly different, for at
least two of the Pitt backs who gave
the Irish something .~ to- - remember
them by in the 19-0 lacing dished out
last year at the Stadium are back.
Both Shedlosky and Greene played ex-
ceptionally well against the Ramblers
in the last meeting, Shedlosky con-
tributing a 58-yard runback of a punt
for a touchdown, and Big Arnold’s bid
for a six-pointer being foiled by a side-
line, after intercepting a pass and rac-
ing about 45 yards. I

Neither of the above-mentioned
backs will be in "the ‘starting quartet;
but they are almost certain to be
pressed into service very early in the
game. The Panther foursome will
likely be made up of Michelosen, La-

"Rue, Randour, a.nd Patrick.

Practice sessions are extending for
long into the evenings this week.
Coach Sutherland would like to get
his eleven functioning as smoothly as
it did after the Mountaineers scored
their lone marker. That drive down
the ﬁeld culminating in LaRu_e’s gal-
lop around left end for 40-yards and
a touchdown had the characteristic
Panther click to it_ and it is toward’
this goal that Coach Sutherland hopes
to work inthe daily drills this week.

Notre ‘Dame, with victories over
Kafisas; Carnegie Tech, and. \Visconsi1r
already in the bag, would like to make‘
the Panthers victim No. 4. For the
last three years Pitt has spelled bad
news for the Irish, and the coming
game is one meeting that the Ram-
blers want to win. A Pittsburgh vic-
tory Saturday would even. up the grid
series between the two teams at four
all, with one tie. . 7

Coach Elmer Layden, former Du-
quesne mentor, used 43 players
against Wisconsin last Saturday to
hang up a 27-0 triumph, indicating that
the Irish reserve‘ power this -year is
very strong. ‘

The Panthers will entrain for South
Bend on Thursday evening.

Junior Women .

To ‘Soak It Up’
In Friday Lunch

Do nice girls dunk? They do, says
the junior class, particularly when
the dunking is free, and to be done
with large sugared doughnuts. And
so, following the precedent first estab-
lished when the present junior class
held their “sophomore dunker" last
year, junior women will trot up to
Heinz House Friday noon to soak up
any amount of doughnutsful of coffee.

Which means that your reporter is
getting well fed these days, what with
LL18 VVAA having their" annual free
feed this week,too. I

Several junior women who have
more time and amiability than your
reporter are busy preparing posters
in which large brown circles are
shown half immersed in what is un-
mistakeably a cup of coffee with a
label around the cup reading “Junior
Donut Dunker.” ' I

And several more junior women are
assembling blue and gold booklets
containing the class program for the
year, to be examined by dunkers
while dun-king.

Publicity committee in charge of
the par.ty includes Martha Bedsworth,

Retail Training Group
Holds Evening Class

The Research Bureau for Retail
Training held the third of a series of
evening classes last night for execu-
tives aiid salesmen of nine downtown
department‘ stores.

Subjects considered were the “Co-
ordination of Store Policies” and the
“_lndustrial Revolution ‘and Machine
Industry." The’ former discussion
was conducted by Bishop Brown, act-
ing head of the Bureau staff, and the
latter was in charge of R. H. Scott,
instructor in economics at the Univer-
sity.

There are two -courses offered this
fall by the Bureau: “A Survey of Re-
tailing Methods and,Practices" and
“Principles of Economics.” The pur-
pose of the courses is to give junior
executives and salesmen a‘more com-
prehensive understanding of retail-
mg.

Each Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock
from October 1 to December 3, and
from January 7 to February 11, the
classes meet in the training depart-

'ment of one of the downtown stores.

ber 30.

Panhel To Publish
Fraternity Songs

Book Of Representative Songs

Fraternity women will be singing
the songs of other fraternities on
campus when the new Panhellenic
songbook is distributed to all Pan-
hellenic members.

The songbook, which will contain
the favorite songs of the various
women’s fraternities, is being com-
piled by Thelma Ritter, Ed36, chair-
man of the by-laws committee of Pan-
hellenic. Miss Ritter has delegated
all associate Panhellenic representa-
tives to obtain the words and music
of these songs. By means of the song-
book, the Council hopes to have each
fraternity become better’ acquainted
with the-songs of other fraternities.

The Council will inaugurate its fall
social season with the annual in-
formal dance to be held at the Hotel
Schenley on Friday, October 25.
Dancing will last from 9 to 1 o’elock.

Tickets are on sale for $1.50 per
couple. This is the only dance on
the Panhellenic calendar open to non-
fraternity as well as fraternity
women.

Several well-known orchestras are
being considered by members of the
social committee, which is under the
chairmanship of Betty Kelley, C37.

bers of the committee, which includes

All Fraternity Women Will Get 

Accessories To Be Exciting,
Asserts ‘Fashion Reporter’

 

“Accessories this season are excit-
ing enough to make one go lyrical,”
says the “Fashion Reporter," the semi-
mouthly fashion sheet published by
the Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing of the University. It is quite
passe to match all the accessories to
one’s suit or dress; rather, one should
have interesting contrast in color or
fabric. “Styles in each accessory
range from classic staples to merry
frivolities.”

Scarfs, favored by many women be-
cause of the variety of waysithey can
be worn, are a high note in fashions.
English type squares of foulards and
crepes. triangles of every fabric, and
the straight reefer scarf will brighten
many, a costume.

In the coed's pockets will be found
liandkerchiefs of rich dark shades to
harmonize with dresses or trimmings.
Of the designs of handkerchiefs the
“Fashion Reporter” says: “Dark
backgrounds with much gaiety of pat-
tern, leaf patterns quite autumny.
sporty plaids and stripes.

Flowers can furnish that needed
touch of color in an ensemble. “Small
tailored versions for suits such as
velveteen boutonniers; huge exagger-
ated versions for afternoon and even-

ing, such as cabbage roses of chiffon
or bouquets of velvet violets,” are
recommended by the “Fashion Re-
porter.”

For those crisp autumn days in the
Stadium, coeds are advised to wear
hose of wool in full length, or knee-
length wools with Lastex top, or
maybe a. pair of sports socks of angora

and brushed wool to keep their feet‘

warm.

The style sheet points out that the
same carefree lines of sports ensem-
bles appear in the pull-on‘ gauntlets
and swagger style mittens, usually
with a strap to hold them up. and
often slit at the back or side. Gloves
will be detailed" with stitchings, per-
forations, lacing, and buckles.

Freshman women who are going to
the .mixer dances and are perplexed
about the dress problem will be glad
to know that even a jersey dress may
be made into an afternoon frock by a
jeweled belt and similar accessories.

Shoe styles this fall emphasize the
comfort, plus style points of rounded
and squared toes. “Fashion Reporter"
says that footgear will harmonize
with fall suits; Araby green, wine, and
navy, as well as many browns and
blacks being the important colors.

Mortar Board Delays I

have been divided into groups. Group

in Room 109, Alumni Hall, and Group
2 meets on Tuesday, sixth hour, in
Room 109. All members of the

ducting several speech classes at
Mount Mercy, and will begin soon to
coach the women's ‘debating group

social worker for the Allegheny

useful in her social work, she prefers
the type of work she is doing’ now.
