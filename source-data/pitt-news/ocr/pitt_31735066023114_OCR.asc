Wellness Resource Center‘ is;

sponsoring all series ‘of ' Self-Care
Cold,Clinics thislxmonth. A . h
. '_-The clinics willbe held from 10

am. to I_p.,m. Tuesdays on the 
. ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral of '

Learning,’ and Thursdays in the
Student ._Union' lobby.

" ‘These are basically, screening
clinics to educate everyone how to
examine themselves for colds, the
ﬂu and even inononucleosis,” said

.Iohanna'Wright, R.N., a health
’ center staff member. 

A list of symptoms to look for and
pamphlets on the various illnesses,
as well as a ‘free examination by

,members\Qf the Peer Medical Aide
Program, will be provided for
students. I _

“We’ll show you how to check
your sinuses, throat and nodes, and
how to take your temperature,”
said Wright. “If we find you are ill,
we’ll refer you to the Student
Health Center.’ "

She said that students, especially
those living in the close quarters of
the dormitories where germs are
easily V communicated, lower their
resistance' to minor illnesses when
they run themselves down with
studying and staying up late,

The clinic is also handing out a,

list ofover-the-counter medications
that can help relieve the cold
symptoms, Wright said. However,
they are not providing any
medicines at the clinics, she
stressed, because there is no cure
for a virus.

Wright said that the best
prevention against getting sick is
“plenty of rest and proper
nutrition, even though it sounds
corny.” She added that the
Wellness Resource Center is
mainly concerned with preventive
medicine. ‘

The clinics, which may be
continued after this month if the

response is good, are open to,

everyone, Wright" said. .

A/tinnesota Nuclear Reactor 
Leaking Radioactive Steam IntoAir

By The Associated'Press .

RED WING, Minn.——A steam
tube I ruptured Tuesday: at the
Prairie’ Island nuclear generating
plant, releasing radioactive gases
into the atmosphere, but the
amounts were so small they‘ could
not be detected outside the plant,
the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion said.

However, Kaplan said, radiation

~ monitoring teams at the plant had

been unable to detect any radiation
in the area around the plant by late
afternoon. -

“Preliminary information indi-
cates there was a small release of
radioactivity to the environment,”
said the NRC ,in a statement from

Washington. » ,
“The licensee reports that
preliminary measurements have

not shown any detectible increase
of radioactivity off the site. This is

Trans-America‘

Dream Bursts

For Balloonists

By The Associated Press

SPENCERVILLE, Ohio—The

I hopes of four balloonists for a

successful non-stop, trans-America
ﬂight ended early Tuesday when a
severe thunderstorm forced them
to scuttle their balloon.and gondola
in a soybean ﬁeld.

The ﬂight of the giant helium-
filled balloon-DaVinci Trans-
Am_erica-ended abruptly after it
was pelted by rain, snow and ice
and threatened by lightning, said
pilot‘ Rudolph Engelmann of
Boulder, Colo.. ’ ‘ .

‘Chief pilot Vera Simons,_ of
McClean, Va., broke a leg during
the landing. ‘She underwent
surgey and was reported in fair
condition at St. Rita’s Medical

Center in nearby Lima.

A Engelmann, along with Fred
Hyde, an eye surgeon from Prairie
Village, Kan.,' and NBC-TV
cameraman Randy Birch, suffered
only bruises.

"A successful ﬂight had appeared
certain for the DaVinci and its four
adventurers. It was only four hours
from surpassing the current en-
durance record for a helium-
filled balloon of 139 hours, six
minutes. It wasrless than 24 hours
from completing the ﬁrstinon-stop
trans-continental balloon ﬂight-
the goal thecrew set when lifti.ng
off from Tillamook, 0re., 2,500
miles to the west, last Wednesday.

“I’m not sure I want to recreate
it,” said Engelmann, at the Allen
County airport early Tuesday
before being ﬂown to Chicago for a
national television appearance.

He said the U.N. declaration of
human rights has struck a blow at
the “deep roots of war, since the
spirit of war in its basic primordial
meaning springs up and grows to
maturity where the inalienable
rights of man are violated.”

The pope, reviving a Vatican
position‘ that has not been voiced in
recent years, urged the internation-
al oversight of Jerusalem because
of its “particular nature,” a
heritage sacred to Judaism, Christ-
ianity and Islam.

He also said that while recogniz-
ing the “value of any concrete
step” to settle the Middle East
conﬂict, a general~overall peace is
not in sight without “equitable
recognition of the rights of all,”
including “just settlement of the
Palestinian question.”

Turning back to the perils of the

-arms race, the pope said modem

weaponry exceeds . in quality and

size the mean of war and

destruction ever known before.”
But he said that eliminating-the

   

war threat demands wiping out its
root causes——the suppression of
human andvreligious rights and
unjust distribution of material
goods on the planet.

“It is not easy, but it must‘be
done,” the pope said.

Standing behind the black
marble rostrum before the high-
doomed blue and gold’ General
Assembly hall, he said: .

“Man lives at the same tinfe
both_ in the world of material values
and in that of spiritual values.”

r. \. 1-,. __H.. /. ’>

His principal qualiﬁcations ap-
pear to be an impressive academic
record, an attractive appearance
and two political upset victories in
rural, sparsely populated South
Dakota. ' ' .

Pressle'r, a convivial and hand-
some bachelor who is a regular "on
Washington's A social circuit, has
made no signiﬁcant mark with his
legislative record, and is identified

with no particular issuebefore the‘

Congress.

Yet his mere presence in the
Senate has given his ambitions
visibility in a year of wide-open
Republican presidential poﬁtics.

Pressler’s candidacy provides a‘
further clue that the Watergate
scandals which drove Richard M.
Nixon from the presidency may
have a direct impacton American
politics for a long time.

Pressler was first ‘elected to
Congress as a House member in
1974. Nixon had resigned -a few
months before and a “throw the,
rascals out” mentality cost many
incumbents, including Pressler’s
opponent, their jobs.

He ran against the advice of
many GOP professionals in South

‘Dakota who said he was too young

and, inexperienced.

Pressler ignored the advice then
and again in 1978 when he went

after the Senate seat vacated by

Democrat James Abourezk. Again,
he successfully defied the conven-
tional political wisdom. .

Now, Pressler is hearing the
same sentiments from skeptics of
his presidential run. His reaction:

“We’lI let the chips fall where they ‘ .
I ~ the $100,000 necessary to qualify

may.” .

A second Watergate legacy isthe
1ikelihood.that Pressler’s: run for
the White House will be ‘financed
partially by taxpayer funds.

In reaction to campaign abuses -
mainly in Nixon's 1972 re‘-election

1974 a system of matching federal

funds for presidential campaigns.

If Pressler, a former .Rhodes

‘ scholar and a Harvard Law School

graduate,’ can raise $5,000 in,

campaign contributions i_n eachof ‘
20’ states, the government will ; 1

match that dollar for dollar.
Pressler saidihe hopes, to raise

formatching funds by January.

Some ‘ political observers‘ say
Pressler’s candidacy may indicate
it hasibecome too easy to run for
president. It remains to be seen
whether Americans will take his
candidacy seriously.

Broadens Appeal With Quality Entertainment

tion at a time when PBS was trying
to broaden its appeal. To bolster
the common" carriage plan, the
promotion budget _wa’s doubled this
year to $6 million.‘ ' _
Last "year, more than two out-of
three households watched some
PBS'a statistic that could be used_
boastfully only at PBS; commercial
networks have very nearly 100
percent penetration during the first
week of each newseason. Weekly
viewership was up 11 percent.

This year promises even more.
New series such as “Musical
Comedy Tonight” and “Mystery!”
are calculated to attract new
viewers from a broader base‘. And
the old programs, from what’s
been seen; grow brighter.

“Musical Comedy Tonight”

“Mystery” does not appear until‘?

. NEW ,YORK—In a ‘world of
business uncertainty, where blun-
ders are hard to avoid and difficult
to recover from, corporate execu-
tives who know instinctively what
not to do are rising to the top.

“There’s a new game in town,”
says Prof. Eugene Jennings. The
person who intuitively avoids
blunders, who knows what to avoid
doing in the crisis, is increasingly
finding himself‘ chosen to lead.

The professor explained that we

live in a blunder-sensitive society,

one in which we expect things to go

wrong. And for good reason: the

risks, or at least the perception of
4 them, seem to have grown.

For corporations this may be
especially true. “They are visible.
they are exposed,” he said. And
they are involved as never before.

Therefore, “If you find an

_ executive who is apt to minimize
 - things going wrong you might get a
‘ winner," a person good at- doing

. the right things and also “adroit at

p Until last weekend, there were-

overloads of power from shutting
off the machines.

Martin 'said each pair of
machines in the laundry room had

_ been connected to a 20-amp circuit

breaker. Since each machine
draws ten amps of power, it had
been assumed that a 20-amp circuit
breaker would be sufficient to
handle the ﬂow of current for each
pair of macines.

.However, in many cases, when
one of the machines on a circuit
was already turned’ on, and the
other machine on the circuit was

‘not doing the wrong things.”

That person doesn’t forsake logic
or research, he said, but doesn’t
contradict his feeling either. He
has, said Jennings, the art of
quickly drawing “sufficient conclu-
sions from infsufficient facts.”

Jenningsiis experienced in the
subject. A psychologist, executive
adviser, auther, and professor of
management at Michigan State, he
has also helped selections commit-
tees choose top executives.

“There is always more than one
right way’, so what an executive
But
what not to do is inexorably
determined by the facts of a
situation and cannot be ignored,”
he explained. - Z

Still, executives today are often
called upon "to make hasty
decisions. “Take time to think,”
said Jennings, “ and’ somebody
might think you have a speech
impediment." Act in confusion‘
and the affect is worse. '

Blunders, mistakes or errors,
might result. Errors involve a lack

about to be turned on, a surge of
power was produced, according to
Martin. This surge would cause a
momentary overload of power, and
the university's sensitive “ground
fault detection breakers”. would
activate, causing the washers to
stop.

The “ground fault detection
breakers” were installed recently
by the university in accordance
with the electric code.

Since the larger circuit breakers
were installed last week, there
have been fewer problems with the

of taste. Mistakes involve poor
judgment, a lack of mental alacrity.

Buta blunder, said Jennings, is
a gross, inexcusable mistake, one
due to lack of instinct or feeling.
“Rational minds cannot forgive it.
It is without common sense.” And
it can be ruinous to the company.

Going into the 1970s, said
Jennings, we were not so blunder-
sensitive. Corporations weren’t as
externally oriented, meaning they
didn't have so many outside
problems with ‘politics, environ-
ment and the like.

Now, he continued, they, have
become more responsive to and

‘responsible for_ the world beyond

their corporations. And they find
fewer chances to “achieve positive
results that .might nullify blun-
ders.” .

The biggest blunders, he finds,
are with media, bureaucrats and
politicians, stockholders, and insti-
tutions such as investment houses
and banks. - Right decisions, he
suggests, aren’t always obvious.

washers, said Martin. Sources told
himthat just two of the laundry
room's 17 machines were out of
order last weekend.

The problems with the washing
machines seemed to be worse
earlier last week. A spot check by
the Pitt News last Wednesday
afternoon revealed that four
washers were filled with water and,
therefore, could not be. used.

Some students interviewed in the
laundry roomclaimed that “about
half” of the machines were not
working. _ A

Several "dryers were also out of
order.

Jack Miller of the maintenance
department indicated maintenance
men had been called upon several
times in the past few weeks toreset

the laundry room circuit breakers.

Donovan Hughes, director of
housing, also heard several com-
plaints about the laundry room
washers last week, and took steps
to have larger circuit breakers
installed.

Hughes said Friday ‘that all
electricity-related problems in the
laundry room should have been
solved by now. Therefore, said
Hughes, students who have diffi-
culties with the washing machines
should phone the company which

_services the University washers.

The phone number is pasted on
each washer in the laundry room.

Hughes added that a serviceman
is on the premises every weekday
to assist students using the
washing machines. '

TMI Officials Await
Decontamination
    S Equipment   

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—A. new system
to decontaminate radioactive water
at Three Mile Island will be ready
for operation _by mid-October, a
plant official said at a public
meeting Tuesday.

At the same meeting, an official
of the U.S.‘ Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said the NRC could
conceivably give clearance to the
system as soon as Thursday-

The system, called Epicore II, is
designed to remove radioactive
material from about 300,000
gallons of water stored‘ inside the
nuclear plant’s auxiliary building
since a March 28' reactor laccident.

“We expect to be completely

[ready to operate Epicore II...in

about l2 days,” said Robert
Arnold,.4’ vice - president of the
Metropolitan Edison Co., operator

V of.the plant.‘

Another 600,000 -gallons of
water, much more severely con-
taminated than that in the auxiliary
building,-is now. on the floor of the
huge containment building that
houses the damaged reactor. A
system to treat that water is in the
design stages.

’Arnold said.there remains only
27,000 gallons of water storage

-capacity within Three Mile Island's
-damaged Unit 2 plant, and about

800 to 1,000 gallons of water is
leaking daily in the Unit 2 auxiliary

'_ building.

But he said there is enough
storage capacity in TMI’s undam-
aged Unit 1 plant to handle leakage
for the next nine months.

Also, with modiﬁcations that
would take about one day to install,

he said a virtually unlimited

amount of water‘ could be pumped

into the containment. building if
necessary. ,
There is minor leakage in the
containment building, which could
conceivably hold millions of gallons
of water. _‘
'Arnold said Epicore Ilvwillbe
‘completed in coming days with the-
installation of some valves, the
calibration ‘of instruments and
other minor steps. .
‘John Collins, the NRC’s deputy
operations chief at TMI, said NRC
staff employees will discuss the

. Epicore II system with the agency’s =

ruling commissioners on Thursday,
and it will be up to them whether to
give the plan a green light.

" He said the commissioners oculd

A take action as soon as Thursday.
Once the water is cleaned by

Epicore II_, the company and NRC
will have to decide how to dispose
of it.

“The treated water would be.
suitable under.’federal regulations 0

for discharge into the river,"

. Arnold said.

But he said the company is now
studying about a dozen different
options of how to handle the water
and will soon offer several
recommendations to the. NRC.

The decontamjnated water will
still contain amounts of radioactive
tritium, which cannot be filtered.
Tritium exists naturally in most
river water. * 4

,“The tritium levels are well
below the regulatory limits...for
drinking water,” Arnold said of the
TMI water.

In the meantime, the decon-
taminated water can be stored in
new tanks built within the Epicore
system, which have'a capacity of
200,000 gallons.

   , At Leas  
 .They’re Listening

A group of administrators more receptive than the
University food service managers who met Monday
with Student Government Board members and
disgruntled resident students could not have been
found. By the end of the meeting, the food service
representatives had praised students’ suggestions but
gave no evidence they’d do anything to answer com"-
plaints of deteriorating food quality.

Whether there ever will be a reaction from the ad-
ministration is doubtful because time is on its side.
Transitive issues like lousy food in the dining halls
can be forgotten easily as the pace of the term
quickens and the more important‘ matters of mid-
terms and papers begin to preoccupy the dissatisfied
students. University food service bureaucrats know
that the bellyachers easily can disappear as the weeks
of the term progress, and then they can return to the
busines of serving the usual unpalatable food to
students who can complain but do little else.

More questions about the quality of food service
and the cafeteria were raised at the meeting than
those that were solved. One manager at the meeting
admitted, “You are observant. The menus have
changed. I don’t care what anyone says, inflation is
up 18 percent. There are things we are puttingon the
menu because we’re trying to cut corners. Maybe we
have had veal a little more often this year.”

Despite recent claims that the cafeteria food is-as
good as ever, the complaints of students that the
food is much worse than it was two or three years
ago, now appear to be true. The food service con-
tributes that to inﬂation. ’ Still, the food service

O‘: offered no solution for the problem. It seems again

that the cafeteria managers are waiting and hoping
the student complaints evaporate as time passes.
Another problem the cafeteria faces that was
raised at the meeting is the deterioration of the kit-
chen facilities. Ted Kokladas, cafeteria manager,
said during the meeting, “We’re living with a
cafeteria that already has seen its life. They are
problems now that we didn’t have 10 years ago.”

While the administrators admitted these problems 1

existed, they did nothing to explain why these con-

_ ditions were allowed to occur and what the food ser-

vice planned to do about them. The only clear action
the administrators made was the acceptance of Stan
Galanski’s offer to use SGB’s researcher to complete
a survey of students to find their opinions about the
- food service. '
The survey is a small step forward, but it can do

nothing to discover why the cafeteris must. cut cor--

ners because of inflation, whythe deteriorating kit-
‘Chen facilities have been allowed to become
inadequate and why managers and 'workers in the
cafeteria seem to be at each others’ throats.

The group best equipped to handle these questions

might be-an organi_zation_,,like the Student Affairs,»

Committee of the R(t‘t/’l'3‘oard of Trustees, which can
act impartially and ‘ask some hard questions about
the food‘ that is being served to students. Two

thousands names on a petition show the depth of

dissatisfaction that a survey can help substantiate, so
intensive hearings by the Student Affairs Committee
would be a sensible step to take besides the initiation
of a survey. ' ‘ -

In response to the debate
between the fraternities and Robert

some clariﬁcation of the issues

Wagner claims so fervently that
education and degradation are
antithetical in theory. but compli-

support his

porno and drugs. I agree with him
that these are mere symptoms of a
much larger problem.

As a woman. I take great-offense

.at such things as a fewfraternity

ads for skin ﬂicks. But I also
recognize that those fraternities are
simply projecting a general societal
trait. and I think that point must be
made clearer by Wagner. As a
student. I can also identify with

and speeding before exams. Sure.
that goes on a lot. but if he wants to
emphasize the meaninglessness of
what goes into obtaining that little

nicely printed on it. I think he has
to delve a little deeper to address

sorority scene or speeding and

What of all those who plug along
day by day. doing what they must
to get by~—or even more—ﬁguring
that it’ll pay in the long run? (Of
course. they're never able to know
what their payment is until they
find themselves out there “working
for something that treats you like a
number or becoming the something
that treats everybody like a
number." to quote Mr. Wagner. If
Mr. Wagner wants to communicate
with those people. which I believe
he does. he has to touch upon more
pertinent issues. Jumping from
fraternity exploitation of women to
capitalistic alienation and degrada-
tion is a pretty big leap. and l’m
afraid that not as many people as
he would like will care to make that

There’s always another layer of
degradation and alienation deeper

The fraternities have every right
to be incensed at the attacks found
in Wagner’s article. But I’m not
sure how much of their anger
should be directed at him. It’s
rather like defending nuclear

hand.

The other , article defending
fraternities just reiterates Wag-
ner’s point, in one sense. by saying
that “the fraternity is an, integral
facet of the University.” offering
many services to the Pitt com-
munity and the community at
large. But does that justify the fact
they participate in acts ‘exploitative
of women?

True. porno is a paft of our‘

society at large. But does that
make it all right? What Wagner's
critics fail to do is to pick up on his
questions of value. both within the
University scene and the general
societal scope.

What I am asking for is some
coherent train of thought. In all the
debate about skin flicks and Greek
civic concerns. I think the intended
issues of discussion have fallen by
the wayside. And I hope to elicit
some thoughtful response from all
parties concerned. ‘

Though the charges vary, they always

are exaggerated, and fraternities, whose ‘

attempts to “inform” the public border
on laughable, respond with a stock
defense—termed “blood and buts”
here—that fails to address the charges
:3-ad probably creates more anti-Greek
feeling than it eases.

The latest battle—fought with letters to
the Pitt News—is an excellent example.

of exploitation as entertainment. While
making these charges, the letter’s auther
made statements that betray a stunning

The fraternities were offered an excellent
chance to inform.

Anyone aware of tradition,_however,
could predict the fraternities’ response.

-Cries of “We gave blood,” and “but we

do this” and “but we do that” came with
the next pair of Pitt News issues.

The Interfraternity Councilr rush
chairman was ﬁrst. He claimed therletter
to which he was responding “is about par

»with all of the negative information the

public is fed about fraternities.” This was
followed, as always, by a listing of
fraternities’ “good deeds.”

This was bad enough for Greeks—an~

illogical response that could lead one to
conclude Greeks are charitable because

they need an occasional excuse.—but the

Pitt’s decision that fraternities are
good—and concluded that “in (this)_light,
cries of ‘exploitation’ do indeed seem
hollow.” This parry, too, lackedlogic.

The exchange can be reduced to this: a

‘ poorly documented charge was made and

met with an attempt to rebut that’ was
illogical and that probably backfired_
This is unfortunate because fraternities
have no reason to be defensive and, after
a well-aimed and -executed campaign to
inform—and not persuade—the public,

probably would ﬁnd themselves “perse- _ -

cuted” no more.

Fraternities provide a large and
irreplacable portion of campus social life,
often aid their members and frequently

contribute effort toward community‘

other membersxof society.

Fraternity “leaders”—this phrase is as . ,3

offensive as “Student leaders”—would
do well to remember this and to abandon
the defense that meets every charge not

self-canonization. _

And those who would attack fratern-

‘By The Associated Press

CINCINNATl—0ld pro Willie
Stargell walloped a‘ three-run
homer in the 11th inning", carrying
the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 5-2
victory over the Cincinnati Reds in
the opening game of the National
League championship series Tues-
day night.

Stargell unloaded on the ﬁrst
pitch from reliever Tom Hume,
sending it deep into the rightcenter
ﬁeld seats to break open the tight,
tense battle and bring a sea of
Pirates out of the dugout to greet
him..

It-“was the third career homer in

playoff action for the 38-year-old
slugger, who was one of the keys‘ in
‘Pittsburgh's dash to the NL East
title. ‘He hit two in 1974 in a losing
effort against Los Angeles.

Hume was working in relief of
Tom Seaver, who had pitched
brilliantly against Pirates starter
John Candelaria for eight innings.
The ace of the Reds bullpen held
Pittsburgh off through the ninth
and 10th innings, allowing only one
harmless single before the decisive
llth.

Tom Foli, who had delivered a

clutch sacriﬁce fly earlier in the
game, -opened the 11th with a
single to left. ‘Matt Alexander went
in to run as slugger Dave Parker
came to the plate. The count went
to 1-2 and Parker fouled off four
pitches before drilling a single to
left, which sent Alexander to
second.

Stargell was next and he wasted
no time with Hume. He jumped on
the first pitch he saw and sent it
high and deep to the right-center
ﬁeld seats for the decisive runs.

The Pirates dugout emptied-
a sea of golden black uniforms

massed between home plate and
the bench——to greet the captain

and inspirational leader of the club.

Pittsburgh threatened to add to

its lead, but Reds reliever Dave
'Tomlin choked off the rest of the
rally. It didn’t matter because the
Pirates had plenty for winner Grant
Jackson.

With two out in the 11th, Jackson
surrendered a single to Dave
Concepcion and walk to Foster,
bringing Johnny Bench to the
plate. Don Robinson, the Pirates
ﬁfth pitcher of the night, relieved
Jackson and walked Bench on a 3-2

delivery. But the next batter, Rat?‘

Knight, struck out to end the game.
For seven innings, the game was
a brilliant duel between Seaver and

Candelaria. Each allowed ﬁve hits *

and two runs and left the game in
the eighth, Seaver for a pinch hitter
and Candelaria for reliever Enrique
Romo.

Romo got into a jam, yeilding a -

Pitt Coach.Jackie Sherrill claims
Saturday's game with Boston
College at Pitt Stadium won’t be
the cake walk a lot of fans expect it
to be. The Panthers defeated the
Eagles, 32-15 in Boston last year.

“Boston College is a team that’s
vastly improved over last year,”
said Sherrill. “They've got some
size, they always have, and they’ve
got some talent.”

After an 0-11 season in 1978, the
Eagles are currently 1-2, having
defeated Villanova, 34-7, while
losing to Tennessee, 28-16, and
Stanford, 33-14. «

The main topic of conversation at
yesterday’s football luncheon was
Pitt’s offense, the unit which has
put but two touchdowns on the
.board during the last two games.
Sherrill isn't about to push the
panic button, though.

“We will do some things
differently,” he explained, “But

we'll not make any wholesale
changesf’
Translated, that means Rick

Trocano will continue to start at
quarterback. “He ran the game-
plan very well against Temple,"
said Sherrill. The coach went on to
say Dan Marino would play this
Saturday (sounds familiar, doesn't
it?).

The receivers will also play,
speciﬁcally Julius Dawkins and
John Brown. According to Sherrill,
the reason they haven't played
much is not because of their lack of
ability, but because of their youth,
and Dawkin’s thumb injury.

ﬁeld he resembles a speeding train
at 100 miles per hour. In whichever
sport he may be playing, he is a
standout. constantly aggressive
with a hard-nosed determination.
This athlete is Tom Liebenguth—a
threat to any type of opposition.
Presently, Liebenguth is playing
his second and last season on the
Pitt soccer team. He has one tennis
season remaining next spring.
Because of a conflict in past years
with scholarships for the two

sports, Liebenguth has only been .

able to play one previous year on
the Panther soccer squad.

Pitt really could have used him
for those two earlier years. The
past is the past, however, and the
present shows that Liebenguth is
one of the most instrumental
players on the team.

than anyone ‘else,’ JoJo Heath, is
now Pitt’s starting free safety, after
playing cornerback last season.
Although Heath realizes a».;switch

probably won’t occur, he's conﬁ-

the Panthers’ ‘defensive four. With
the graduation of Erv Seigel, the
all-purpose sweeper position was
left open. An important move by
Panther coach Leo Bemis ﬁnds
Liebenguth ﬁlling this sweeper
spot.

What a move it has turned out to
be. The Panthers’ defense of 1979
has proven to be the strongest.area
on the ﬁeld. And one can see that
Liebenguth stands out as the most
impressive of the four. The unit as
a whole combines speed, hustling
and strength. Liebenguth’s play
combines all of these assets.

Most Americans don’t play
soccer until their early teens, but
Liebenguth began playing the
game in England at the age of six.

“Over there, soccer 'is the

Liebenguth certainly did more
than just pick up the sport. He
brought with him a keen knowledge
of the sport when he entered the
junior high program at nearby
North Allegheny High School.
Liebenguth played for three years
on the varsity team. In his senior

us acts as a versatile player

switching for someone when they
need help. One thing about
playing sweeper, though, is that
from this position you can see
everything developing on the
ﬁeld.“ _

"in preseason, we proved that
we could score goals; those ﬁrst are
always the toughest to get.” said
Liebenguth; “We are starting to
settle down now and work together
as a unit.

“We have great players out

“We passed the ﬁrst test by
winning our own tournament,” the
coach said, “but the ﬁeld is much
stronger at Cincinnati and we will
be pushed a little more to vyin it.”

“Although they are considered
our second string,” said Hebert,
“every one of them could start on
many other college teams.”

5 When the freshmen were in-
serted into the lineup, they proved
that they could be starters at
another university. In fact,
Duquesne probably wishes that
they could have a few. of the
freshman Pantherettes.-

_Pitt (9-8-3) won the second and
third games with little trouble by
scores of 15-3 and 15-5, respect-
ively. T’

“It’s good that we got to look at

the freshmen,” said Hebert. ‘‘In
particular, Robin Kuklais and Julie
Gaul did ﬁne jobs.” ~

The coach added that Pitt is
totally out of Duquesne’s league
and because of that, it was tough
for the Pantherettes to concentrate
on the match. '

Pitt’s next competition will be
this weekend when they travel to
Ohio for the Cincinnati Invitational.
The ﬁeld will consist of Ball State,
Cleveland State, Pitt, Morehead

"State, Wright State, Indiana and

host Cincinnati and one yet
unannounced team.

“We’re one of three or four
teams that could win the tourn-
ament,” said Hebert, “including
Indiana and Cincinnati.”

He added that‘ this tournament
will be a better test for the
Pantherettes than last weekend’s

4 Kevin Quay|.ateB|oomer,- But Still Number-One

By BRETT DIAMOND
Pitt News Staff Writer

~ ' There is’one lesson of life which
a lot of people never learn: to act in
moderation. Not too much, and not
too little. Sometimes it is difficult to
stay in that medium. There is only
one period of life when this does
not apply. That period is childhood.
where abilities are developed for
the future.

Kevin Quay is the number-one
seeded player on the Pitt tennis
team this year. He is one of those
few folks who seems to. have
defeated that philosophy. Coming
from an Zlltfﬂ jr..-;t- out.~;i'rlt.‘ of
Phiiadelplﬁn ,-_~;~l|.~:l_("m:slmlz<;cl;~.:t't.
Quay didn’t start playing; tcitnis;
untilihe was 14.

For many boys growing up in
Philadelphia, sports are a way of
life. With a professional team in
every sport, and heavy coverage of
the major sports, the interest level
is high. Quay played these sports
(such as basketball, baseball, and
football) most of the time. Then he
discovered tennis.

But it wasn’t really a discovery.
It was bound to happen. His father
was a three-letter man at West
Chester State just outside of Philly.
One of those letters was in tennis.

Once Quay got started in the game.
there was always that little extra he
could learn that would have taken
others longer. Since then, tennis
has been his main love.

Quay played tennis at Plymouth-
Whitemarsh high school. While
Philadelphia is not known as the
tennis capital of the world. there
are still somestrong tennis players
in the area. Quay feels that in a few
years, maybe as many as seven out
of the top fifteen players will be
from around Philly. He had good

years in high school. He didn’t lose’

often, and twice made it ‘to the

State Finals.

ll=.: came to “ill for a fr.:w
t‘ctt.<.mt:-.. but lllii-:l1A\" int‘ tennis. In
his‘ l‘t'cslttnztt'i yt-var. he played

number three singles. By now he
was playing everyday. as he had for
about three years.',Quay' noted,
“There is a big difference between
a freshman tennis player and a
senior player,” and remembers a
loss of two in that season due to
.just that reason. -
—Moving into his junior year. he
felt ready to move up the tennis
team ladder. The previous sum-
mer, he lost about thirty pounds in
order to get into top condition,'and
he worked as a counselor at a camp
where the main sport was tennis.

Playing with other people of his
own caliber, he kept the edge of his
game over the summer. ‘

' A psychology major, Quay enjoys
working with children.
counselor, he got to work with
them every day. He is dedicated to
tennis, but also enjoys playing
basketball and is an avid fan of the
Eagles, Phillies, and 76ers.

His dedication to tennis is
accentuated by long practice hours.
Quay is responsible, as are all team
members, for two hours of practice
a day. Then there is his own
training program, which consists of
running "a few? miles, doing some
pt1l_l-tips. and other CXClt§l.'§(3I$ to
keep in shape. Every ntoming he
plays tettttis with teztmmate Tom
Leibenguth.

Although Quay is not having too
many tennis problems, Pitt’s
program is. Because it consistently
loses money every year, the
amount of matches the Panthers

have played in the past three years

nas decreased from nineteen to
ten. This.has caused a couple of
top-notched players to transfer to
other schools for more playing
time. It also makes it difficult for
Pitt to attract players necessary for

_ Owens, then the club’s farm boss.

 

PHILADELPHIA AP: The big
guessing game in Philadelphia
right now is who will be the next
manager of .the Philadelphia
Phillies.

‘ The answer is simple.

It will be interim manager Dallas
Green-if he wants it. .

If not, bet the mortgage on
Bobby Wine, a long-time Phillies’

A coach.

What makes this speculation
easy is that a_ new Phillies’
manager is almost certain to come
from within the organization.

Make Lee Elia. manager of the‘
‘ Phils’ Oaklahoma City farm team, a

long shot.

The Philadelphia Inquirer con-
ducted a poll on who the fans
wanted to manage the Phillies. The
results showed former outﬁelder
Richie Ashburn, now the colorman
on the club’s radio and television
network, a 2-1 choice over first
baseman Pete Rose. Green finished
third. "

Green succeeded Danny Ozark
as Phillies’ manager in August,
when "owner Rudy Carpenter and
personal director Paul Owens
decided to make a change. The club
tlren was a disappointing ﬁfth.

Green ,was the Phillies’ farm

' system director. He said he was
.chosen manager to assess which
players were giving thier all, who ,

wanted to continue to play in
Philadelphia. His job was to try and
find out in six weeks why the team
picked to win the division collapsed
like a punctured balloon.

Green said a decision on the
manager for 1980 would be made
after the season, probably before
the World Series.

The 45-year-old Green posted a I

20-22 record as a major league
pitcher with the Phillies, New York
Mets and Washington -Senators.
He moved into the Phillies’ front
in 1969, as" assistant to

During his baseball career,
Green, a graduate of the University
of Delaware, served as a pitching
-coach,‘ and managed at the minor
league level. He’s been a favorrite
of. the Carpenter family as far back

7 s“- his college days.

Green became farm director in
June 1972, when Owens was
elevated to the job of general
manager, succeeding the late John

Quinn, who had been ﬁred. He,
Owens ‘and Carpenter, who in-
herited the Phillies from his father,
Bob, in 1973, have worked closely
ever since.

The trio built a healthy farm
system that has developedrplayers
for both the parent club, and as bait
in trades designed to help the
Phillies. They developed the
Phillies into a team which won the
National League East in 1976, 1977
and 1978. ' -

But the Phillies lost all three
years in the National League
playoffs.

Last December, they signed Pete
Rose, a free agent after 16 years at
Cincinnati, believing they had
finally forged the ﬁnal link for a
team that would not only win a
division, but a league pennant and
a World Series. Rose did his part,
hitting .331, getting 200 hits for a
10th season, breaking a tie at nine
with the - immortal Ty Cobb, a
member of baseball’s Hall of
Fame.

But most of the club rattled
through the season as if it was in a
death throe. Rose’s hustle wasn’t
catching. The Phillies "wound up
fourth, although they did play well
through ‘most of Green’s tenure in
the dugout. .

Green screamed, used the term
“quit.” He refused to let them just
play out the season. In fact, the
Phillies won two of three from
Montreal in the last weekend of the
season to help . eliminate the
Expos from the East pennant race.

But Green wasn't happy. with
what he saw while managing. He
refused to name names, declaring
that he would report to Carpenter
and Owens after the season on
what direction 'he felt the club had
to go to solve its problems.

i
Green has indicated he doesn’t
want to manage a club that quits,
but he also has made it clear that a

major house cleaning is‘ not in,

order. He believes the Phillies still
are a talanted, team and can win

again with a few pointed moves,
trades, purchases, minor league
players, etc.

The bottom line here appears to
be that Green will manage the
Phillies in 1980, if he wants the job.
Or, he’ll manage if Carpenter
wants him to stay in the dugout.
He’s an organization man from top
to bottom.

If Green doesn’t want the job, or
Carpenter is not of a mind to ask

The review of “Get the Knack” in last
week’s Showcase exhibits the tragedy of a
few psychology courses grossly misin-

' terpreted by yet another college student.

Is this an album review? Aside from one
poorly placed" simile, where is the
description of the music? Does this writer
know the members of The Knack so
intimately that he can state thay they

“cannot love?” And where does Mr.
Buffenmyer get the credentials to

publicly psychoanalyze this album and

-band?

V From the beginning to the end ofthe
piece (and I read to the end hoping that

‘somewhere some sense could be

found.-—it could not) there is such a smug,
know-it-all attlitude.of,Ithe_ writer, that it
makes onewonder just how much is this

it would be his way. Joni Mitchell is
clearly out of her league. But, in this
case, so would everyone else. It is
evident that Mitchell's voice is not suited
to the music; There is no possible way
that she could put the proper feeling and
expression intothe music. Mingus’ and
Mitchell’s musicalexperiences and life
experiences are_ worlds apart. It shows.

Kreskyi And The Decade Bringcplub Rock Rock 

By SCOTT MOWRY " ’

For too long, the city of Pittsburgh has
wallowed in the depths of anonymity of
this country’s popular music establish-
ment. The raps against this town are by
now infamous: absence of homegrown
talent, lack of consistent fan support for
many artists, stagnant radio airplay and a
limited number of venues in which

concerts can be held.

But as hometown bands like the Iron
City Houserockers, the Granati Brothers,
and most recently, David Werner, begin
to draw attention to the local scene,
Danny Kresky Enterprises and The
Decade Lounge in Oakland have been
committed for the past year in gaining
some much, needed respectability for
Pittsburgh on a national level.

In a pﬂtnership that began -last
December 28th when The David
Johansen Group launched the project into
motion, Kresky and The Decade have
attempted to establish a top-notch,
nationally recognized rock club that’
would attract musical talent from around
the world. So far, Kresky and The
Decade have jointly sponsored 23 shows,
most of which have been received warmly
by Pittsburgh’s rock enthusiasts.

Kresky, a 35-year old entrepeneur from

Los Angeles, has been promoting rock‘.

concerts and extravaganzas in this city
since 1973. About a year and a half ago,
he became convinced that Pittsburgh
needed to expand its live rock resources
and add a concert hall much smaller than
the 3600-seat Stanley Theatre.

“I Q was used to clubs ‘like The
Troubadour, The Whiskey a-Go-Go, and
The Roxy in L.A. and I wanted something
for Pittsburgh as well,” Kresky explain-
ed. i . ‘
Basically Kresky’s original goal was'to
create a , vital and progressive club
“scene," similar to those that have been
enormously successful/in other important
markets such as Los Angeles, New York, -
Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and
Cleveland. '

' “I guess I’m from the old school of rock
n’ ro.ll where I feel that a group should be
good on stage above everything else,” he
theorized. ’

Kresky approached many’ of the clubs
and bars in the area but was most
impressed by The Decade’s response to
his concept. “I received great interest
from The Decade management. They co-
operated with me and made their club

available to me.” I
But before settling on The Decade,
Kresky experimented first with

Antonino’s, also in Oakland, and brought
in Eddie Money to perform. Aboutthe
same time, The “Decade had begun" to

_ broaden their evening shows_ when Meat.’

Loaf participated in a gigantic toga
festival. The collaboration ‘seemed
inevitable. A
“Danny really wantedto do something
for the rocklscene in Pittsburgh. This city
really lacked a place where you could see

a band of national prominence in a small
intimate setting. Wewere happy that he
asked us,” said the Decade manager,
who prefers to be known as Dom.

Although -both Kresky and Dom
admitted to some of The Decade’s
shortcomings, they were quick to point
out that the pluses of the rock club project
far outweigh the minuses.

' “I know it gets hot and sweaty and
crowded in here at times but where else
-are you going to be able to see national.
groups—good rock n’ roll groups—so

close and for- a few dollars,” Dom said‘

sympathetically.
Kresky expressed similar sentiments.
“I realize the physical premises are small

and tight but I see it as better than not '

having these groups play at all.”

. When Kresky chose to headquarter his
project ‘in the Decade, he instituted
several changes within the club. First,
the stage area was rebuilt_ and elevated to
accommodate _not onlygthe bigger bands
but the availability to the fans as well.
Secondly, a more convenient seating

Kresky u/sually expects a capacity of 250

..Iust.lately, the club has propped a
giant video screen in the bar vicinity that
displays a closed circuit view for those

unable to obtain a position close enough’

to the stage.. Kresky says color video is
the next step.

Manager Dom continues to develop the
visual atmosphere of The Decade, giving
it a nostalgic yet hip appearance. When
the club opened six years ago, Dom chose
to emulate The Decade after the New
Jersey" coast bars famous for their lively

music and late night parties. But now, ,

added to the elaborate T-shirt decore
suspended above the bar, he has
plastered the walls with posters. photos,
album covers, records and other

.mernorabilia fromthe groups that have C

  

performed on the Decade stage. The
most impressive: feature of the club is the
large, copper plaque modestly positioned‘
in the back that commemorates the 23
Kresky produced shows.

Congenial and straight-forward men,
both Kresky and Dom share a genuine
concern for Pittsburgh's status in the rock
world. Each dismisses’ the misconcep-
tion that Pittsburgh is a less than

sophisticated, town» and cannot support

the club scene.

Kresky believes that not only can
Pittsburgh sustain a club scene but has
already proven so. “We are 70 per cent
of the way there. There still needs to be
more of a-recognition of the club by

everyone. We need more people talking-

about the Decade, telling their friends

and getting them to come along too.”
“I’m very confident in the people’ of

Pittsburgh. .1 wouldn’._t have gotten into

so far,” Kresky emphatically stated.
“Pittsburgh’s a tough, honest town. If

we comeaacross with a good product we. 5.?

will get the support we need,” Dom
explained,_ who in the past has
demonstrated/a tremendous concern for"
local bands. I
Dom especially speaks highly of the‘
friendships he has cultivated with .a‘
number of the musicians. “Mark Tanner
was one of the nicest guys you would ever-
want to meet. Ant the Henry Paul Band
are our friends, they wanna come back-
and play for us again. Even Joe
Jackson--here’s a guy from Bristol,
England who made a point of coming
down from the dressing room and
drinking with us after the show.” Dom’

also can fondly relate more than a few _

Houserocker memories as well.

As a perfectly complimented team,
Kresky and Dom work together to procure '
a steady inﬂux of new talent to The
Decade. 1
groups that appear destined for future

‘ success. At least one album release and I

co-operation from the parent record
company are factors Kresky keeps- an‘;

alert eye for, while Dom often ,tr‘av“els’ to _,-5.

.No matter what the cit)T,‘ selling and
promoting rock n’ roll can be a risky
business, however Kresky points out that -
only two of his 23 shows have failed to
drawadequately. ‘ ’
Still some acts have gone over better-
than others. Lenny and the Squigtones, a
band with local ties, pulled in the largest
Decade crowd, last May, since Kresky’s
involvement: But other groups such as
The Ramones, who-played before two—
packed houses in March, The Henry Paul,
Band, The Police and Joe Jackson have
done extremely well at the box office also.
It all comes down to timing, calculating

when an act might do well and_where. ~, -_

Dom maintains that Kresky’s ability» at
this hit or miss game is unequalled.
Sometimes, however, an artist can’
outrace his reputations and few will be
familiar with the name and the music,
Stere Forbert’s appearance last January
was a perfect example. Had he perhaps

delayed his visit to Pittsburgh, For_be_rt_ 
would have probably packed The Decade. - ~

Kresky and Dom, however, recom-
mend that no Decade show should be

missed. -
“I want the people of Pittsburgh to

that I care,” Kresky said of his absolute

There is no doubt that Pittsburgh’s

Scufﬂe admitted the fact that Studio

been a concerted, and successful effort to
get Studio back to its original, moving,
growing and maturing form.

The most unique thing about Studio is
its appeal to, and need for students.
They are the actors, and the directors.
They control stage and lighting. The
Studio’s goal is to envelop the student in
any or all aspects of the theatre world that

‘Mr. Mike's Mondo Video’ Fails To Live Up To its Own   Hype

By MARK" HOLAN

Mr.- Mike’s Mondo Video
Directed by Michael 0’Donoghue

“Mr. Mike’s Mondo Video” bills itself
as being sick. gross, degenerated. violent
and tasteless. And it is; parts of it at
least. Unfortunately “Mondo Video"
isn't really sick. gross, degenerated,
violenror tasteless enough to merit its
own hype (or ticket price.) .

Director Michael Q'Donoghue. (Mr.
Mike). is a ‘veteran -‘of, the National
Lampoon/Saturday Night,Live school of
comedy. His “Mon'do" project was
originally planned as--an NBC television
special. Network- censors deleted several
segments. however. and 0'Donoghue
wouldn‘t ‘compromise the\ ﬁnished pro- .
duct; hence the movie.

in particular, the NBC hierarchy was
offended by two skits. One called
“Celebrity Deformities." «*T«:a.tvires Satur-

who: “miss the toilet seat,” “smell their

wipe it on their pants," or “drink too
much and can’t get it up." The episode
ends with, the vile admission: “When I
reach down and feel a ﬁrm colostomy

\ bag. ‘I know I'm with a real man."

Ugh! A The’ censors certainly seem
justiﬁed in supressing that last remark. A
1929 skitrflick with full frontal nudity

called “Uncle Sy and the Sirens" and‘ a—
scene from “Hang-Gliding School -For

Cats" also would not be permitted.

So much for the sleezy side of “Mondo
Video.” The ﬁlm is not completely
without comedic merit. ‘Several scenes.
in fact, are very good. '

The prelude to “Mondo" is a
ten-minute sequence of Mr. Bill;

current cult hero- Mr. Bill's.popularity is

smallest of problems with mimicked

‘ ‘0oooooooooooooh Nooooooooooooooo! ” ’

This skit finds Mr. ‘Bill in the hospital ,

with amnesia ‘after a car accident. Mr.
Bill’s friend, Mr. Hand, -tries to refresh

his memory by going over the de_tails off

Mr. Bill’s past. The ensuing flashbacks",
in essence. act as a Best of the Mr.. Bill
Show, but fail‘ to cure the amnesia. Only
another blow on the head. delivered by
Dr. Sluggo, can cure the round-mouthed
Bill‘.

Also good are the ' two “Dream
Sequences," a skit about mid-westerners
who worship “Hawaii S-0" 'sJack Lord
as their god and a scene with the late Sid
Vicious singing Frank Sinatra's classic “I
Did I-t My Way." There are also amusing
man-in-the-street interviews which ask
such .inane questions such "as, “Do you
think elephants should be subject to the

death penalty?" and “Do you think" deaf '

artddumb people shou|d__be- allowed to

talk with their hands while driving a
car?” ‘ ‘

The best sequence of “Mondo.Video,”.
however, is the last. A group of gaudily
dressed island natives anxiously await an
American cargo plane to parachute down

crates of American fad items instead of H

food _and medical supplies. The happy

natives open boxes ﬁlled with hula-hoops,’
black lights,. Day Glo posters, Silly'String

and Crazy Foam. Their thatched huts are

ﬁlled with these items and on the beach

they have resurrected a sand monument

which,hosts their god—LavaLamps. It is

a —very effective satire on‘ American

materialism and waste.

' “Mondo Video," which is done in the
"oddities-of—the~world” style of the early

' 360s is not the best piece of comedy or
, satire ava-ilable on screen today. nor is it

as sickand bizarre as it promises to be. It
is. however. a good cult diversity ‘for
those who-can stomach its raw edges .and
imperfections. /» ' '

  Y Music Society   Brings Classical Music Recitals To Area    t

By JANICE SCHULER

The internationally renowned Y Music

Society begins its 54th annual Recital \
_ Series on Wednesday, October‘10th at the
Jewish Community Center.

The Music Society began in 1926.
There were three or four other recital
series in Pittsburgh then but for the last
ﬁfteen years the Y has been the only one
in the city. _

Over the years the Y’s artist selection
committee has maintained a tradition .of

featuring promising young artists as well
as musicians of international stature. It
has introduced to Pittsburgh audiences
many accomplished and highly revered
performers; the’ late Efrem Zimbalist Sr.
played during that first year, Vladimir
Horowitz and Andre"Segovia in 1928,
Marion Anderson in 1936, (at that time
she was refused a room at the Schenley
Hotel because she was black.) Artur
Rubenstein playedlat the Center in 1940,
Isaac Stern in 1942, Mstislav Rostro-
povi'_ch in 1965, Pinchas Zuckerman in
1967 and Beverly Sills- in 1971.

Allen Sher,- cellist and teacher, has

_ been the director of the Y Series ‘since

1971 and says that Pittsburghers tend to
devalue their culture but the Y is a highly
acclaimed recital series, ‘comparable to.
only a few other_ American cities like
Boston, Ann~Arbor and San Francisco.
Recital music caters to music con-
noisseurs "who are interested in the
possibilities of the music,‘ the interpre-
tive sensitivity and charisma a soloist" can
bring to a performance. The (Morris
Kaufmann -Auditorium seats 100 and
offers an intimate setting for the
particular expression of the performer.
This intimacy is rare when “bigger is
better.” and the Y Series has managed _to
present unvarnished music without

SHOWCASE on

Movies  

relying on commercial gimmicks to draw
an audience.

Economics have forced many people
away from the honest sound you get from
expensive stereo equipment, or better
still, a live concert. In a live
‘performance, one expects to get the
truest sound the musicians can make plus
the emotional involvement the soloist
projects while performing.

The Y Music Society offers a special

- student subscription because they feel it

is important for young people to have the
opportunity to be aware of contemporary
musicians and the integrity of their inter-
pretations without stereophonic distor-
tions. '

Mark Zeltser will open the season on
October 10 with the Haydn Sonata, No.
48, Chopin’s Nocturne, Op. 27, Two
Mazurkas in A Minor, the Fantasy”, Op.

'49, Pr_okoﬁev’s Five Sarcasmsand the B

Minor Sonata _by Liszt. When Zeltser
played with thePittsburgh Symphony last
year, Carl Apone, of the Pittsburgh Press
remarked of the playing: “His technique
reminded one of the youthful Horowitz,
the drama and power of Serkin -and the
sensitivity of Ashkenazy.’’' . '
On November 3, the violinist,‘ Henryk
Szeryng (pronouncedshearing) will be
performing. ._ ; Szeryng emigrated to
Mexico, from Poland in 1946 and in 1956
the Mexican government gave him a
diplomatic passport. They felt that as
their Cultural ‘Ambassador, Szeryng
could create more good will by playing his
violin all overthe world than if they had

an. official'“ verbalizing their civility.’

Szer.y_ng is known _for his intensely
profound interpretations and insightful
musicianship, Artur Rubenstein refers to
him as ‘fa musician’s”musician.”

Ten __ _
Directed by Blake Edwards
The most interesting thing about
“Ten,” a new ﬁlm written and directed
by Blake Edwards, is not the picture
itself, but what Edwards is trying to say
‘with it. . Is it a film about a man in a
mid-life crisis, or about what Edwards
believes to be the most beautiful girl in
the world, or a study of sexual
degeneracy, or. just a vehicle for
Edwards’ wife Julie Andrews to use a few
expletives? Whatever it is, Edwards is
unable to focus on any of these aspects .
making “Ten” a very pointless and
confusing piece of entertainment.

' songwriter/ actor Dudley Moore) ﬁnds his

forty-second birthday starting a chain of

Foreign Film ‘Wifemistress’ Story Of    And Vengeance -

By THOMAS PALMER ’
Wifemistress ‘

“Wifemistriss” is .a drama. of a woman
whose passion finally surfaces when it is
used as a vehicle of revenge. Yet this
picturesque Italian film. beautifully
scored and photographed for maximum
eliciting of purpose, falls - short "of

A potential. despite its sensory appeal.

Marco Vicario skillfully choreographs
his scenes, switching and zooming so-well
that much of the story needs no dialogue.
and the most effective scenes do not.

world. a

Webber forsakes a relationship with his '

singing girlfriend, Samantha (played

rather masculinely by Julie Andrews) to _ '

regain his feeling of lost youth and ﬁnd
this beautiful "girl. Director Edwards then
puts Webber through a series of slapstick
situations, from bees flying up his nose,
to rolling down California hills.

Meanwhile, Andrews consistently
shocks those fans of the Mary Poppins era
with her earthiness. Edwards also tries to
add an ironic twist when he introduces
Webber’s lyricist as a middle-age
homosexual going through his own
regrets of love.

Throughout the ﬁlm, Edwards en-
velops his characters in a society which
disregards any type’ of sexual mores.

Edwards.camouﬂages any“ explicitness
with — humor. Webber is inept‘, but
relentless. He stumbles into his pursuit

wife’s deceased father’s business.
Luigi, however, does not offer similar
comforts to the.farmers and their starving
families who rent land from him. And
Antonia, shattered by her supposed
shortcomings, feigns a “creeping par-

Falsely accused of murder, Luigi goes
into hiding. in an attic that ironically looks

   Carl Arter Brings Jazz. To Homewood And To Pittsburgh

- By DAVID E. STUBBS

On Dallas Avenue in Homewood, there ,.

" is a" quaint little club called Eileen’s.

From the outside, Eileen’s looks much
like any number of small taverns found
throughout the area, but inside there is

. quite a difference.

The downstairs “Zebra Room,”
however, is quiet and‘ surprisingly plush.
It is an atmosphere which is nothing less
than perfect for the iazz played within.

One band, the Carl Arter Band, is'a
three-piece act featuring Carl Arter on
acoustic and electric piano; Herbert
.Marshall on electric bass, and Ron Tucker
on drums. The group also features spot
performances by an extremely talented

~ ‘sensitivity,

and energetic woman whom everyone
calls “Tiny.”

The group is extremely tight with lots
of room for improvisation by Arter.
Bassist Marshall plays in, out and all

around’ the harmonic structure of the _
tunes adding different colors and textures

to the songs without overpowering the
‘piano melodies. Drummer Tucker seems
to be in another world, grooving through
rhythm rolls which fall smoothly on time.
Tucker’s drumming does for this band
what usually takes an added percussion-
ist. ‘

Arter first came to Eileen’s in January
’76 for a two-week engagement and he
still plays there. Arter had a few
comments concerning performing jazz in
Pittsburgh.

I

SHOWCASE: How do you feel about
performing jazz in Pittsburgh?

ARTER: Ilike it. I always pick my spots.
Some groups try to get the places that pay
the most money, but there are a lot of
things more important than money.

SHOWCASE: Do you feel most of the
audiences that you play for fully
appreciate the quality of music and .talent
you possess?

ARTER: Oh yea, I'know most of’ the
people here. They come and enjoy the
music and we enjoy playing it. Some
musicians like the fanfare. I’m not trying

to become famous. I just like to play. If D‘

you want to be famous you have to leave.

‘Pittsburgh, and a lot have. —

SHOWCASE: What do you think could’
make Pittsburgh a better jazz city?

ARTER: Exposure.~~ "Last spring we
played at Carnegie Music Hall and got
some good TV exposure. Pittsburgh is ap

 good jazz town. A goodplaceto get your,

musical foundations. Music depends a l0l
on the audience. When we played in
Vancouver, once we started playing you
could have heard a pin drop. It was
crowdediand really nice. They had this
beautiful grand piano, --perfectly in tune
too. You don’t have places like that in

Pittsburgh but it’s my home and I love it V

anyway. ’ ’ I '

The David Johansen Group
The Decade
September 25, 1979

By SCOTT MOWRY

David Johansen is a name to be
reckoned with. His show’ last Tuesday
night at The Decade proved him to be a
rock performer of tremendous depth,
maturity, magnetism and
out-and-out musical power.

Making his second appearance in
Pittsburgh in the last nine months,

' .. Johansen and his explosive five-piece
” band rocked and rolled like aboat caught
T 4..-in a hurricane.
 ‘pumped with the life of the big city and

" Johansen’s music

“A mesmerizing presence on stage,

outrageous, lunatic image he held as

A’ frontman for the grossly misunderstood

‘NewiYork Dolls, the godfathers of the

‘ punk movement.

With a thick air pf excitement hovering
among The Decade audience, after a fine
warm-up set by Pittsburgh’s Hell Band,
the Johansen Group kicked its show off

with the hard-driving “Cool Metro”
fromthe first solo record. Johansen set a
blistering pace for the evening that never
let up as he spotlighted many songs from
his latest record ‘'In Style."
The very best the evening had to offer
were five numbers sandwiched right in
- the middle of the 90-minute set.
Johansen and his band burned with the
intensity  “Flamingo Road" and then

perhaps the most 0utstanding_s0ng of the

night. “I'm A Lover” followed with its
rousing “Yeah, yeah, yeah” chorus,

Johansen then strapped on an acoustic
guitar and led his band

through
“Justine," a tender, compassionate love

song. “Let’s just dance," were the words

repeated over and over as Johansen and
Co. drove “Frenchette" to the limit after
a slow, acoustic beginning.

Throughout the night, Johansen
displayed an undeniable quality of
making his screaming shrieking vocal
remarkedly melodic. His encore
performances of New York Doll trade-
marks “Personality’Crisis” and “Baby-

lon” highlighted Johansen’s big, reson-

ate voice.
Concluding with the Four Tops’ raver,

“Reach Out, I'll Be There,” Johansen .-

David Joha_ nsen performed at the  4% seoome in‘ less in years and was

left the frenzied but smiling Pittsburgh

crowd anxious for more as seemingly

hundreds of hands reached out to touch
Johansen to thank him for a magical
evening.

With a more melodic approach on his
latest album and the strength of a tightly
executed and spontaneous show, David
Johansen seems ready to grab the _rock
world by the tail. If only he can hold on.

Bob Dylan
Slow Train Coming
Columbia

Bob Dylan has once again proven what
has been known to most of us all along,
that excellence needs no explanation.
“Slow Train Coming” needs no explana-

’ tion. Although it lends itself to several

interpretations, the bottom. line is simple:
Dylan has created a work of art. It is both
a personal statement of Dylan's indivi-
duality, and an expression of concern for
the future. The lyrics view the present
and question the direction in which
society appears to be. going.‘ \That
direction, according to Dylan, must be
changed and this album is his effort at

I eliciting that change.

From the first cut, “Gotta Serve
Somebody,” the listener is aware of the
tightness and intensity of the album.
Dylan seems once again’ determined to

deliver a message. He does so with all _

the strength and intensity of his_earlier
efforts, “Blood” on the Tracks" and
“Highway. 61 Revisited.” Religious
rhetoric and symbolism proliferate this
album but the delivery is the same as the
“protest” songs which have placed Dylan
where he is today. L

A powerful lowdown rhythm grabs your
attention from the onset, shakes it for all
it's worth throughout the album and
doesn’t let go' until the end. And even
then you're not_ sure. _ The lyrics are
simple, sharpand direct. Dylan gives you

T the message and leaves it to you to choose

between good and evil.

the album is religion. Rumors of a “born-

again” "Dylan are more than Tslightly . '

supported by the cuts,‘ “Gonna Change
My« Way of Thinking,” “I Believe in

You” and “When He Returns” as well as '

by a suggestive photo on the back cover.
A new vulnerability is also revealed in the

cut “Precious Angel,” a romantic song in I H’

which Dylan sings, “Shine your light,
Shine your light on me, I just can’t'make
it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.”_
This openness helps make the album
more convincing and effective.

Dylan is accompanied by an excellent
supporting cast in “Slow Train Coming”:
Barry Beckett on keyboards,/Tim
Drummond on bass and Pick Withers on
drums: But clearly the standout musician

is Mark Knopﬂer of Dire Straights on lead V

guitar. He demonstrates why he is the
best new guitarist to come along in quite
some time. This combination of
musicians adds to the style and class of
the album.

.“Slow Train Coming” has. a solidi.
mixture of driving "message songs and"

gentle, concerned love songs. _It is"'a
functional masterpiece in that it serves
the purposes that Dyla/n intended it to
serve, it conveys his message of faith to
the listener, it demonstrates the result of
proper mixing’ of brilliant lyrics and
music, and most of all itentertains the
audience.
