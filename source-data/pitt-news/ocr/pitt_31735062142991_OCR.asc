The sculptures vary from sever-

sortment of animal ﬁgures in-
cludes a, full-sized tiger cub modd-
eled after one "in the Bronx zoo,
a reclining tiger and one in full
chase, and several bulls in a va-

Other interesting examples are
several heads, an intriguing ab-
stract called “The Dancers,” and

Quotes ‘Henry

“In the hall of great and true
Americans, Patrick Henry holds
an undisputed place,”‘ Rozanski
said in the initial sentence of his
six minute oration, “Patrick Hen-
ry, Orator and Patriot.”

“Patrick Henry was the master

_ of his own art-oratory. No other

man spoke with such a feeling of
cause. Each man in his day who
laboredpfora reality wanted hu-

nianity and democratic govern-

ment,” he continued. b

Rozanski quoted from Patrick
Henry’s most famous speech: “Is
life so- dear . . . to be purchased
at the price of bonds or chains.
Forbid it Almighty God! ‘The
ﬂame of liberty began to roar’.”

Contestants drew lots for posi-
tions and were introduced by

Phi Eta Sigma, i’1'eshman honorary fraternity, last week

fourvyears by freshmen men who ﬁnd that first year the

' ,“roughest.”' «

Prior to 1942 many hundreds of freshmen were helped

H fcoiisidcirable by the role that Phi Eta. Sigma now resumes: that

of big brother ‘teachers to freshmen. Many an F has been
shaded into 21 D in those last few weeks of school. And many

. learned how to study after a Phi Eta Sigma work;out.

To the freshmen ‘who have not as yet taken advantage
of this generous offer of the time and energy on the part of
Phi Eta Sigma, we say tomorrow ’s the last day you can sign
up in the dea.-11 of men’s oﬂicc. And for many‘ more freshmen
Who arealready using this service and who would like to ‘tell

Some ofithe top scores to date
have ‘been turned in by John

- with a 78 last' Tuesday. The course

has a par seventy—one.

Which aspirants will leave on

be decided today.

The six men who will make the
trip will not necessarily hold down

Here’: a perfectly strange man looking you in
the eye. You've been inn-oduced...but it's up
to you to carry on from there. Maybe your go-
between threw in some clues along with your

names. Maybe you’re exposed to each other without beneﬁt

The thought panic: some of you into sticky silences. You

hurl an opener at you. But maybe he thinks ladies should
make the opening gambit. So it could be a draw...

halted by hurler George Gold-

Pitchers Ineffective

Mitterlinpg’-s men garnered six.

more runs in later innings as com-
pared with two more by the Vul-

cans. They looked sound aﬁeld,

and at hat, but were desperately
wanting in good pitching. Perhaps
the fact that it was necessary to

   

use four pitchers in the seventh
frame drove Mitterling to remark,
“What we need is a pitcher who
can throw the ball over the plate.”

POGO STICKS

Lots of people like to play jack rabbit. Still, as
a way of going to work every morning, we
don’t see much of a future for Pogo Sticks. Not

even aluminum Pogo Sticks.

But mention any other means of locomotion
or transportation and our aluminum “Imagi-
neers” get a gleam in their eyes. After all, what
is more logical than vehicles made of aluminum?
Less weight to move. More payload.

We turned our imagination loose on that idea
years ago . . . then engineered our thinking into
trains, trucks, plan‘5"s, ships. ,Alcoa’s Develop-

. ment Division has a staff of “Imagineers” who

think of nothing else but better wayaxto trans-
port people, products. and materials by using
aluminum. Actually, we have four separate

staffs of transportation engineers, one’ each on

railroads, highway vehicles, ships and aircraft.

_ Whatever you do after college, you’ll beneﬁt
'" from that. If you go into transportation, these
Alcoa engineers will be working with you to cut
costs, speed schedules, improve facilities. Or if
you choose some ﬁeld of production, they’ll be
helping to transport your materials and ﬁnished
goods cheaper and faster. ALUMINUM COMPANY
