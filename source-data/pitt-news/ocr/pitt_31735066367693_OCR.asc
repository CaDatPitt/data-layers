Coal Mines Slow _

  Pool Construction

Major difﬁculties in the terrain surrounding the con-
struction of the ultra-modern Physical Education Unit across
from the Field House on Allequippa St. has caused a delay in
the builders’ progress. Construction workers have . uncov-
ered a large maze of smoldering coal mines.

The Physical Education Unit will house a facilities build-

Tests were originally taken by

ing and swimming pool.

a firm which the University hired

to determine the composition of

the ground, but first results did
not disclose the existence of any
loose dirt or mines.

A second examination, however,
revealed the presence of a net-
work of abandone_d mines.

Structure Redesigned

The whole structure had to be’

redesigned, with additional cais-
sons being installed, and the orig-
inal ones had to be planted more
deeply in order tohit solid rock.
Caissons are reinforcing boxes’
-or chembers used for construc-
tion work, usually under water.
As many as 45 have been sunk
under the pool area of the proj-
ect, and approximately 105 un-
‘ der the facilities building.\_,_/,_
As a result, the completion date
of April, 1962, may be extended
to September, 1962.
The construction company was
told that the ground consisted of

undisturbed shale, but, it was.

mines, fill composes a consider-
able amount of the soil.
Mines Formed

“All of the mines had to be

‘formed’,” superintendent William

_ Croyle commented, “that is, we

had to put in wooden forms and
iron sheets to make it sound.”
“We had to resign the pool
area, and had to go as much as
40 feet deeper with the col-
umns. That cost us about a
month of valuable time. We ex-
pect to catch up, but we’re go-
ing to have to really step things
up‘); ‘

The builders did not encounter
any difficulty at all in construct-
ing the Field House, according

will appear at the University
Book Center next Tuesday to
autograph thebook about the Pi-_
rates’ successful .1960 season‘
which he and Bill Surface wrote.

The Pirate captain will sign all
copies of “The World Champion
Pittsburgh Pirates” sold between
the hours of noon and 2 p.m.

The “fiery, courageous captain”
of the Bucs led the National
League in hitting last year and
also won the .Most Valuable Play-

Dr. Mary M. Roberts, associate
professor of speech and director
of. the William Pitt Debate Union,
has assumed a new position as
associate professor of speech with
the Kansas State College at Pitts-
burg.

Dr. Roberts taught at Kansas
State before doing doctorate work
at Louisiana State University.
She came to the University in
1957. .. p

In her new position, Dr. Roberts
will head the Master Program of
Speech at thecollege.

“I have very much enjoyed my
associations with the students in
the William Pitt Debate Union,”
she said when asked how she
liked her stay at the University.

Several University students and
faculty members have expressed
their interest in the Peace Corps.
Students have applied as volun-
teers in the Corps and professors
have submitted project ideas.
None of the students or plans
have been accepted yet.

Thomas Quimby, National Di-
rector of the Peace Corps, empha-
sized at last week’s meeting that
“the questionaire is not a test but
an inventory of skills.”

The questionnaire is the for-
mal application form for the
Peace Corps program. Copies of
the questionnaire and of Peace
Corps Fact Books are available
at 604 Brackenridge Hall or at
the SU Desk.

Quimby urged foreign students
to inform the local students who
are interested in the Peace Corps
about the conditions in their

countries. He also pointed out the
great need for liberal arts stu-

dents.

. About one-half of the people to
be sent will be teachers, and lib-
eral arts graduates will be accept-
ed as readily as education majors.

Error Corrected

Students worried about a D
grade which they felt should be
a B n(?ed not inquire at the Office
of Student Records. The grade is
really a D.

The mistake on grades never
reached the students. According to
Richard Hodges, director of the

It occurred on 500 reports, but
was stopped before it reached the

Increases Study

Of Biological Cells

B-y ALLEN JOHNSON
The School of Medicine has
installed one of the world’s
most powerful electron mic-
roscopes in the anatomy lab-
oratory, one which is capable

‘ of magnifying a specimen to

approximately 200,000 times the
original size.

“We have eagerly awaited the
installation of the election micro-
scope,” Dr. E. R. McClusky, vice
chancellor-for the health profes-
sions, said in announcing its ac-
quisition. , p

“The new instrument will en-
able our scientists to record and
interpret heretofore undeﬁnable
structures within biological cells.
The installation indicates the
Health Center’s increasing inter-
est in molecular biology, a most
important ﬁeld of scientiﬁc inves-

.tigation.”

Only One in West
The microscope is the only one
of its kind in the western hemi-
sphere and only one of four in
the world. It will serve as an im-
portant tool in solving a universal
mystery, “Why do living things
grow old?” A
Dr. Albert Lansing, head of
the Department of Anatomy,
who will be using this instru-
ment in searching for the an-
swer to this question, is attack-
ing the problem by studying a
small organism called a rotifer.
There are several advantages to
using the rotifer in this research.
First, laboratory control of gene-
tic variation confused with age
variation is possible, thus elimi-
nating the possibility of getting
genetic variation confused with
age variation. A
Secondly the rotifer’s life span

. is short. This means that an ex-

periment is not draggedout, and
can azlso be repeated many times.

Finally the rotifer has the same
cells at the beginning and end of
its 21-day life span making it
possible to not only study the

same organisms, but the very.

same cells throughout the entire
experiment. This would be impos-
sible with human beings and
most‘ other organisms.
Studies Metabolism

One of Dr. Lansing’s ﬁrstw uses
for the new microscope was to
resolve a certain structure within
the rotifer’s cilia which serves as
the organism’s mode of locomo-
tion. Dr. Lansing had been try-
ing to resolve this structure for
the past two years with less pow-
erful microscopes but with the
new micr0scope,iwhich is called
the EM200, this focusing was done
in less than a day._

Dr. Leonard Napolitano, as-
sistant professor of anatomy,
will also use the EM200. He
will attack the problem of or-
ganism growing old by studying
the metabolism of fat cells.

. New Instrument

DR. ALBERT I. LANSING, pro-
fessor of anatomy at the Uni-
versity school of medicine, is
measuring the degree of vacuum
that exists in the verticle col-

eration is similar to that of a
television or a radar scope in that
it makes use of an electron gun
to shoot electrons on" a floures-
cent screen.

“Using electrons is much more

convenient than using light as,

ordinary microscopes do since an
electron beam is thousands of

times smaller than a light beam.
The smaller electron beam is obv-
iously able to differentiate be-
tween smaller objects than the
light beam. ,
Forms Image

This electron beam travels
down a column through several
condenser lenses composed of
magnetic coils whose effect upon
the beam is to draw,the beam
to an extremely ﬁne point. The
beam of electrons then bombard-
ed the specimen under study. ,

A fewpof the electrons run
into the neutrons and protons
that make up the specimen,
scattering in all directions.

The other electrons travel on

through the spaces in the atom‘

between the neutrons and pro-
tons and after being spread out
again ‘by more lensvs, form the
image on the fluorescent screen.
These images may be viewed
with the naked eye or through
a binocular attachment which
increases the magniﬁcation from
200,000 to 1,000,000, or they ma.y
be photographed by cameras.
The EM200 is valued at approx-
imately $42,000. Negotiations for
its purchase began more than‘ﬁve
years ago, when the instrument
was in its blueprint stage;

Always Active

Before complaining about lack A of‘ activities-—nothing
to do-——-one shouldtake notice of the University's Student
Union. '

If youpare really lookingfor something to do during
the Spring trimester, the Student Union Boardhas planned
many programs for you.

By attending or participating in these events, you as-
sure the success of the SU’s programs, and in addition en-‘

_‘courage the SU to offer more programs.

iWi1liam H. Cooper stated that four Midday Series

Programs are slated for the term, but if‘ the attendance is"

good, three more maybe added.

Also, if students show any interest in renewing Friday
night dances,_ the SU board will incorporate some dances
into the program. /

Another familiar series again this term is’ the Univer-
sity P.M. Series. On May 11, the Musical Art Quartet, fea-
turing principal members of the Pittsburgh Symphony, will
be the ﬁrst of three programs inthis series.

But lectures, program and dances are not the only SU
functionsthat you can support. Every other Wednesday,
the ﬁlms of great comedians will be presented in the SU
ballroom; every Monday and Thursday, bridge games will
be set up in the Venetian Room; and if students sign up
as Music Room attendants, that facility will also be availa-
ble. ’ ’

. The one program’ that the SU board has endorsed again

this year, and the one which received the greatest response ,

from students and faculty members last year, is the Iced
Tea Hour. Iced Tea Hour means free ice tea served every
Monday and Thursday afternoon and at the-extended Mid-

day Series afternoon session.

It is gratifying to see that the SU has scheduled all of
these events again this year. And we hope that you will
help them to make these program a success this term.

nated in San Francisco in December, 1960, and is
due to wind up in Moscow (bar-
ring unforseen diﬂiculties) in the
fall of this year.

These people, sponsored by
Non-Violent 

ing of peoples throughout the
world to non—violent action and
peaceful protest as an alterna-
tive. to war. Both the goal and
the unrestrained enthusiasm and
idealism with which they are
seeking it are worthy of mention.

But unfornately, these people are looking for the
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and the

 

‘means they are using to find it could have danger-

ous consequences in these times.

Most of__these walkers have some college educa- .

tion, and should, therefore, be at least sophisticated
enough politically to realize that what they advo-
cate, unilateral disarmament, is completely imprac-
tical and dangerous.
One-Sided Pact

Under unilateral disarmament, one side would
take the initiative by destroying its nuclear stock-
piles and then reducing its conventional. forces to a
point where they could menace no other nations.
This would show the rest of the world that this
particular nation isdealing in good faith.

.Since the Russians are obviously not going to
do this, these paciﬁsfs arguethat we should.

Our national military policy of massive deter-
rence, modiﬁed somewhat by the recent trend to-

ward limited war capabilities, is, unfortunate1y,
the ideal way to prevent war.

No status quo based on a “balance of te;.l.0r.,
can be good. But, nevertheless, it is a detei‘rent.ag
the name implies, and the Russians have not at_
tacked us or marched through Europe, presumably
because of thisdeterrent we hold. _

If we abandon our weapons, nuclear and con;
ventional, there would bepabsolutely nothing in the
wayof Russian imperialism, in Africa, in Europe,
and in America. Abandoning our weapons would
certainly eliminate the danger of war, because the
Russians would not be forced to revert to war to
see -their ends accomplished. We would lose without
firing a shot, and, in fact, we would be inviting
defeat.

But this line of reasoning is, of course, faulty,
if one decides that life is so precious that it is not
worth standing up and facing danger to risk ‘it_
Life was precious to the members of the Maquis,
the French who resisted the Germans in VVo1~]d
War II. It was precious to the Hungarians who died
in the streets of Budapest. It was precious to any-
one who gave up his life for democracy.

These paciﬁsts argue that our democracy is not
all-that it should be. Perhaps they are right. Per-
haps our ideology is taking a beating because of

not

 

the demands of this undeclared‘ war we are now -~

ﬁghting.

But to me it seems indisputable that in the end

we do have an ideology worth ﬁghting for, and
dying for if necessary. And the sooner more peoplg
realize this,4the better 'are*ou_r chances for even.
tually defeating communism.
p One point needs reiteration. This -is 3 life or
death struggle and we must win. Victory will not
come through paciﬁsm and the» theory of non.
violent resistance.

This is, I must note, not the fault of the journal
itself. Newspapers are indis-
pensible. They inform, instruct
and entertain. They are one of
the few things thata man gladly
takes to bed with him every
night or drinks coffee with every

No, the newspapers, as an in-

_ most of the sheets have a rather nasty policy of

printing facts; those ugly truths about the world
which bring unbearable discomfort to the reader.
Pressure Snow-balls

Throughout the past few months, there has been
a snow-balling buildup of pressure in the State of

the Planet that is frighteningly similar to that

which pi-eceeded the major conﬂicts of'thjs cen-
tury; conflicts so unearthly that they have been
assigned numbers, rather than names.

It has gotten to the point where one grasps at
laughable straws in this neurotic tornado of events:
a man was noted the other day thanking God that
Austria no longer has any bulls — eye - covered

No Lippman I, just another fellow (patriotic,
but chicken) with a Draft Card in his bill—less bill-
fold. But I have been working on a careful analy-

sis of the big, “bad, bold banner-headlines of late.

Here are some suggestions to relieve world tension:.

The Congo has been a trouble spot for months.
Their problem. is integration, of course. But things
are looking up there, because of the tremendous
amount of Negroes who are now holding top mili-
tary and political positions.

Cuba is also in turmoil. It has been diagnosed
that due to the dieting craze in America, Cuba’:

biggest export, sugar, has fallen oil‘. As a result, V

the people have nothing to do but sit around and
wage a. one-sided war against the Clrillette Com-
pany. We should start buying great quantities of
sugar, to bolster'Cuba’s economy. I think that
would be sweet. ‘

Or take Algeria. Please.

Laos cannot be overlooked. Oh, may this haos
be safe from Laos. Laos is a little country. Some-
place. Anyway, all they seem to have over there is
jungle and people. A great market for opening I
Disneyland.

Berlin cannot be overlooked, either. Unless one

It is hoped, at any rate, that these medicines
for the festering sores of the world will bring as
much peace of mind to you as they have brought
to me. They probably did.

One last question probably remains in your
mind. You are doubtlessly wondering what all of
my scrutinous analytic research has to do with the
title of this column, and vice versa. Nothing, of
course. I merely wanted to illustrate the power
of that three-letter word in the title; I feel that it

Not long _ago I was asked by the
editors of Mademoiselle magazine to
shuiile through a stack of question-
naires that they had sent to several
hundred young women in their last
years of college and several hundred
others who had recently graduated.
The questionnaires were intended to
pry out of these young women their
notions of success—-in college, in jobs,
in marriage. Unlike many question-
naires that I have examined these
seemed to me agreeably civilized both
in the questions asked and in the ways
in which they were answered.

Some of the young ladies were wist-
ful, some deﬁant; some were puzzled,
quizzical, romantic, and some, but only
a few, had a glint of hard ambition.
A few were blasé or smug. But all of
them seemed to be frank.

Well-rounded and well-protected is one of the dis-
tinguishing characteristicsof today’s young people.

others. A job is a way of meeting “in-
teresting people,” of keeping amused,
but it must not be all—absorbing. “I
think deﬁnitely that a job should not
consume your life,” wrote a girl from
the University of Texas. “It should be
one in which you are interested and
which enables you to lead a well-
rounded life.” Another girl, from the
University of Wisconsin, echoed this:
she said that she was interested in a
job, “but only to the extent that it

wouldn’t interfere with a well-rounded

social life.” A

The devotion to well-roundedness
appears to go further than just ambi-
tion for oneself. It applies equally to
ambition for one’s husband. Few of
the private faces seemed interested in
marrying a man determined to get to
the top of his profession, who by hard
and persistent work would push back
the frontiers of his chosen ﬁeld. They
were thinking of his happiness and of
his. health, and they cast both in the
setting of relaxed weekends-——the pic-

ture of thoroughly barbecued bliss. “I

want my husband to be ambitious but
not dangerously so,” wrote one college
girl and another said, “I don’t.want
him to have such a high executive po-
sition that it would ruin his health or
personal relationships with his
friends or family.” Throughout the
answers there was a constant identiﬁ-
cation of work and achievement with
ruined health, lost friends, unhappi-
ness. It was associated with trampling
on other people who are also on the
ladder, with having no time for the
children and working incessantly over
weekends. “The college girl's picture

I

of a Successful Person,’ commented
one of the young editors of Mademoi-
selle who had spent a good deal of time
over the questionnaires, “seems to be
a combination of a bore. and a battered-
and-broken adventurer.”

And money? Money is all right so
long as you can buy happiness with it.
A great deal of money, young women
believe, can only be acquired at the
sacriﬁce of virtue, sincerity, children,
principles, and well-roundedness.
“Just enough to get along comfort-
ably,” seems to be the goal, though the
meaning of comfortably varied con-
siderably from answer to answer. ,
Most of all they want their husbands
to be happy in their jobs, and not to
break their necks or their hearts try-

ing to get rich. “No job,” wrote one

girl, “should encroach on relaxing
time.” As you might expect, the young
wives who answered the question-
naire that was sent them took a more
lively interest than the college girls
in the quantity as well as the quality

of their husbands’ pay checks.

Is there, do you suppose, any real
risk of developing a criterion of suc-
cess that -is based on well-rounded-
ness? A great many well-rounded
young women summons up for me a
large bunch of hothouse grapes -
lovely to look at, plump, smooth, care- *
fully protected from the crankiness of

"weather, and tasteless. Pebbles in a

stream are also well-rounded; so are
the vowels in the mouth of an elocu-
tion teacher. What is the likeness of
the well-rounded male, the male de-
sired by the well-rounded female?
First of all he is affable, friendly,

tleusuccess?  

and trustworthy and he tries to be all
things to all people. He gets on easily
with everybody, everybody, that is,
who is also well-rounded and even
with a few who are not. He is conser-
vative in his tastes for furniture,
foods, entertainments, and women. He

. is conscientious, does his duty by his

community and, when called upon, by
his country. He never gets caught off
balance (neither, incidentally,.does a
ball, which is also well-rounded) , and
he changes his mind slowly because
he likes-to see all sides of a problem.
He, is a man .whose principles -are not
easily shaken, though he knows how
to give a little here and take a little
there; he recognizes that compromise
is not without virtue if it is used for
virtuous ends. He prefers the status
quo, but he does not deny the processes
of evolution. This tends‘ to ‘make him
conservative in his political opinions,
but he is not a reactionary. He is a
middle-of—the-roader. He is a natural
do-gooder within the realm of his con-
venience and of what he expects, the
opinion of his circle of ‘friends to be.
He is ‘not, however, going to risk his
position in the community by espous-
ing an unpopular point of view. He
pushes no frontiers back. He does not
get “burned up” about anything, ex-

cept, possibly, those things that.

threaten his position in the pyramid
of society in which he lives or that
might endanger his property values
or the well—being of his family. '
Someday I should like to meet the
well-rounded man I have just de-
scribed. He must be a rare and re-
markable specimen. I doubt if he
exists at all; he is merely a literaI'Y
ﬁgment, the kind of man one discovers
only by trying to strike an average
from the answers to a questionnaire.
He is not an individual; he is just 3

generality. He is a statistical meatball.

But there is evidence that the meat-
ball is not unrelated to reality. David
Riesmanin an article in The Ameri-
can Scholar told of a study of Prince-
ton seniors that had been made by
Time magazine. Interviewers had

’ asked the students what they thought

their lives would be like in ﬁfteen
years. “No life in the ulcer belt for

A me,” one of the young men said, and ‘
1 another said, “Why struggle on my

own when I can enjoy the big psycho-
logical income of being a member of
a big outﬁt?” The theme of well-
roundedness emerges as clearly from
the Princeton seniors as it did from
the Mademoiselle girls. One young
man who plans to be a lawyer said
(and Mr. Riesman after some initial
doubt decided that the young man
wasn’t trying to pull the interviewer‘ s

, leg) : “I’ll belong to all the associa-

tions you can think of-Elks, VFWs,
Boy Scouts and Boys’ Clubs, YMCA,
American Legion, etc. It will keep
me away from home a lot. But my
wife won’t mind. She'll be vivacious
and easy with people. And she will
belong to everything in sight too-
especially the League of Women Vo-
ters. I won’t marry her until I'm
twenty-eight, and so when I’m thirty-
six we will have only two of the four
children I hope foreventually. We’ll

M be living in an upper middle class

home costing about $20,000 by then,
in ‘a suburban fringe. . . .We’ll have
two Fords oar Chevvies when I'm
thirty‘-six, so we can both keep the
busy schedule we’ll have. But in ad-
dition to this public social life, we’ll
have private friends who don't even
live around Toledo —- friends with

in whom we can be completely natural
‘and relaxed. That’s where Princeton

friends will be very important.”

Mr. Riesman, who doesn’t take the
results of the Time suryey too seri-
ously. says of the young men: “The
career they want is the good life, for
which their corporation or profession
serves as the ‘good ‘provider. These
men already know they won’t be pres-
ident - they wouldn’t want the job
with its unpredictable demands, its
presumptive big city locale, its dis-
ruption of family and recreational
life.” _

i The temptation to make a genera-
tionﬁt such a formula leads to alarm
and distrust-on the part of those who

A . do not belong to it and disgust and

boredom on the part of those who do.
But this brief composite portrait of
a generation's idea of success is not
entirely without validity, and if it
seems to be without any very sharp
edges we must remember that genera-
tions are also without edges; they are
not compartments; they are merely
what we mark oﬁ‘ for the sake of con-
venience on a continuous line.
Actually the changes in ambition
and in the concept of success are not
only changes in where people want
to get but also in how they want to get

 there. They do not want a peak but,

as Riesman says, a plateau on which

 6 COLLEGIATE DIGEST 0 APRIL 1981

to live. They want to proceed up a
road that has protective barriers on
either side; they want to go step by
step up the corporation ladder, some
faster than others, of course, but with
a sense of security about the climb.
There is more kudos, because there

. is also more security, in a man's being

part of a large and nationally known
corporation than part of a small one.
There seem to be fewer men and wo-
men who want to desert the road
and high-tail it to a higher peak that
can be reached only over rocky ter-
rain. The dream of the young family
is to move not only up the road of
career but to move from suburb to
suburb. Many young‘ families today
start life in the mass-produced sub-

urbs where houses are all alike and, I

it is said, there is only one class since
everybody makes about the same a-
mount of money. Their ambition is to
move as soon as they can afford it to
a slightly older and better-established
suburb where each house has a little
more land and is not the image of the

' house next door, and so on to older

suburbs and more land and bigger
houses. At each step there is a slightly
larger and more expensive car, more
“appliances” in the kitchen, perhaps
better schools for the children and
with luck private schools.

Many of the parents of those who
are now in college or who have recent-
ly graduated were married in the
twenties-the era of the so-called Lost
Generation, of the boom that seemed
as though it would never end, of Bix
Beiderbecke, and the 4 per cent in-
come tax. The world had been saved
for democracy once and for all by the
First World War, and anybody could
save himself by following the formula
of Dr. Emil Coué. All you had to do
was to repeat over and over each
night before you went to sleep the
magic words “Day by day in every
way I’m getting better and better”;
your psyche took care of the rest.
Young men stepped out of college into
jobs that paid them handsomely; they
bought stocks on margin and doubled
their money as though by divine prov-
idence. The world gave them a living
and bathtub gin and exaggerated no-
tions about prosperity. Then the
crash caught them. A few jumped out
of the windows of oﬂice buildings;
some just could not pay the mortgage
on the house; a good many found that

what they thought were steady jobs

with promising futures were no jobs

-at all. About the only things that went

up after the crash were the woman’s
waistline and the bosom; they were
almost the only natural resources
whose value had not been over-
estimated

_. Faith in money as a goal to which
to devote one’s entire energies was
destroyed. Money turned out to be
ephemeral just as surely to those who
had put their life’s savings aside in
“sure things” as to those who had

.made money out of money on the

market. Success when measured in
dollars became a hollow thing, a faith-
less mistress not to be followed or

ﬂirted with. The war had saved the_

world for democracy and democracy
was broke. The intellectuals were
called in to tinker with the economic
machinery, and see if they could get
the motor going again. A few wanted
to tear the motor down and remodel
it according to a nineteenth-century
blueprint devised by a man named
Marx; others wanted to patch it up,
give it a shot of high-octane planning
and see if it would not begin to hum
again on its own. Panaceas became
the.prder of the day.

153?. ...3*‘he world turned out not to be
safe for democracy at all. Democracy
had to ﬁght for its life. The planners
with their doctrines and panaceas and
the young men and women who had
been brought up by “permissive” par-
ents turned into ﬁghters along with
everybody else. They believed that once
Facism was licked we could settle
down again to solving our economic
and social problems and to building
reasonable lives. What we got was
prosperity, the threat of Russia, an
entirely unfamiliar set of problems,
and a whole new freezer of mores,
idols, and aspirations.

This alone might explain the pres-

ent cautious concern of the young»

with security and well-roundedness.
But there is another and equally im-

portant cause, as Pangloss could

prove, for this effect. Their parents’
generation, which had at first wrung
its hands over its failura, soon began
to forget the lessons it had learned in
the depression. Once more they saw
visions of an ever-expanding economy
and they began to dance on the dikes
that, they were conﬁdent, could with-
stand any ﬂoods that might threaten
prosperity. They slipped back into old
habits of complacency and acted as
though this were, after all, the best
of all possible worlds. Once again they
seemed to think that they had all of
the answers and that a beneﬁcent gov-
ernment run by beneﬁcent and prac-
tical men would protect them from all
evil. There were cushions and crutches
everywhere. But there was something
a little unreal about their euphoria,
something a little too smug about
their self-conﬁdence that seemed to
betray a distrust of themselves and
their faith.

Their laughter has become a little
too loud, their jokes a little too shrill.
They make an uneasy vibration in the
air. The young cannot help but feel it.

Brieﬂy
Reviewed

novels by established writers who,
each in his own way, is a critic of

our times, should‘ be of particular,

interest to you. The third is a fas-
cinating study of that ever-shifting
subject, slang. 0

Of the novels, probably the most
important is John Dos Passos’ new
book titled Midcentury, which is
widely hailed as his most meaning-
ful book since the “U.S.A.” trilogy,
which was published twenty-five.
years ago. Using many of the same
techniques be employed in“U.S.A.”,

 topical biographies and

summaries of contemporary events,
Dos/,Passos, in this new book, deals
principally -with the theme of the
bankruptcy of  in mod-
ern society. His protagonists, whose
stories are’ interwoven, and inter-
landed with his quasi-journalistic
devices, are three union leaders and
two businessmen, whose varying

fates, even when they try to-combat

them, are vitiated by “the organiza-
tion” in one way or another, or
simply by the over-organization of
contemporary life. The book is

neither as poignant nor as probing "’

of  character as “U.S.A.”
-—-it is more sociological and very
soap-boxy, but in its very note of
despair and even cynicism, it hits
hard and trenchantly.

Like Dos Passos, O’I-Iara, in his
three new novelettes collectively en-
titled Sermons and Soda-Water, has

returnedtoemliez-tlmemes,andthe.

result far more resembles the au-
tbor’s vintage work (Appointment
in Samara) than some ofhis pon-
derous later novels. The best of the
three is “Imagine Kissing Pete”, a
moving, tersely but beautifully writ-
ten story of a destructive, compul-
sive marriage that becomes resur-
rected by something more than
patience,bytimeandguiltanda
kind of moral fatigue, and even by
hope. O’Hara is terse, sharp, hmny
and tragic, and he wonderfully man-
ages to encompass the passage of
time, the impact of generations, one
upon the other, forward and back-
ward, without losing a moment of
narrative impact. It. is a stylistic
triumph. The’ other two long stories,
“We're Friends Again” and “The
Girl on the Baggage Truck”, while
not quite so accomplished, are of
the same genre.

For a change of pace, there is
Crowell’s new Dictionary Of Amer-
ican Slang, compiled and edited by

Harold Wentworth and Stuart Berg ‘

Flexner. The authors have com-
piled a fairly complete listing and it
carries an academic tone. There are
many omissions on the derivations,
but the book does have the merit of
being up-to-date and contains a full
vocabulary of the beatnik lingo.

IIIIIIIlllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIA.

Jim O‘Brien, a sports writer on the Pitt News, quoted
trackman Steve Munter last week as sayinghe hated to run
in the Penn Relays because it was like an. “Animal Farm.”
Munter said today he referred to the conditions at the Relays
where athletes are crowded together in one place and then

herded out on .to the track.

Thisquotation of Munter’s caused a little excitement in
the downtown papers but the amazing thing about the pic-
ture Munter painted is‘that it is true.

Anyone who has been to the Penn Relays knowns what
he is talking about. From Friday morning to late Saturday
afternoon relays are run almost continuously.

About 15 minutes before each race, athletes ‘are
gathered in to an area the size of a bull pen. A high iron
gate keeps. the athletes in place. As one race nears its
conclusions, the runners in the next race are taken along
the wall of Franklin Field‘? tolthe starting line. As soon
as one group of runners ﬁnishes, they run the next group

around the track.

There are bulls, I mean athletes, o£ all sizesranging
from grade school age to the college graduate. The similarity .
between the Penn Relays and.a rodeo is uncanny. .

Still the quote by Munter, or the Panther’s poor showing
this season was not cause enough for Pitt only to send Dan
Kanell to represent the University at the Relays last week-

end in Philadelphia.

Since teams were run in sections according to past per-
formances, the Panther would have been placed in a slow
section and might have won several races. _

Kanell, however, accounted well for himself taking a-
fourth in the Championship, Discus throw and a second in the

college shotput. -

One of the highlights of the Relays, along with the run-
ning of .-.theAbeleine Christian 440 relays team and .Villa-
nova’s one-mile relay victory, their eighth consecutive at
the Relays, was the giving of awards at the Silver Baton

Ceremonies halfway through

first NCAA track meet in 1921, was Frank Shay, a gradu-

Cats Face Clarion, Duquesne,

West Virginia This Weelc .

Panther Pitchers
Hurting; Bluffites
At orbes Field

Coach Bobby Lewis is faced

with depth problems
again as a slight epidemic of

once

minor injuries has besieged
his already thin pitching staff.
Ralph Shutterly,

given a rough treatment by Slip-
pery Rock, incurred a" sore arm in

who was

his brief appearance. And Frank

Ignaczak is still nursing, a bad
wing, too.

To make matters worse, the
schedule-makers have given Lewis
three games to cope with this
week and he is wondering just
who is going to handle the pitch
ing“ duties. -

The Panthers travel to Clarion
today in the first test. Last —year
their hosts shut out the Cats, 6-0,
and Lewis is fearful that they
might repeat the showing. “They
had a real sharp pitcher; he was
only a freshman or a sophomore,
so I know that he’ll be back. I
only hope that he has ‘worked
against someone, else lately,
“Lewis remarked.

Formidable Foe

On the following day, Duquesne
poses a formidable nine at Forbes
‘Field at 3:00. Last season the
arch-rival Dukes knocked off Pitt,
5-4, in their only meeting. This
year Coach “Doc” Skender has a
new threat to face the Panthers.
Mike Rice, the scrappy basketball
star, holds down the shortstop
position and has been a consider-
able lielp tothe Bluffites.

Another friendly neighbor
comes visiting on Saturday.
West Virginia travels northward
to engage Pitt at West Field in
Munhall at 3:00. The Moun-
taineers will bring a club that
has seen far more action than
their hosts to date.‘

WVU has an 8-6 record, but the
bulk of‘ that mark was gained
during the Easter holidays on a
southern tour. “This -has been the
rainiest season ever, if my mem-
ory serves me right,” moaned

Golfers Play Host
To Two Schools

Coach George Underwood's
golfers will play host to West Vir-
ginia and Washington & Jefferson
on Saturday at the Wildwood
Country Club. The match will be-
gin at 2:00 p.m. The linksmen will
carry a 3-6 mark into the tri-
angular meet.

The Panthers met the Moun-
taineers who are coached by Ira
Rodgers, one of their all time foot-
ball greats. Rodgers can use six
lettermen against the Panthers if
he wishes. Outstanding among the
returnees are Gary Loring, Sid
Bennett and Captain Bob King.
Also available are sophomores
Jim Hess and Kirk Nolte.

Coach Underwood will probably
stick with the six men that he
used .against Juniata.

Veteran Crew

West Virginia has a veteran
crew, with about seven-lettermen
bolstering the attack. Last year
Pitt lost two games to -these
southern foes, 2-0 and 6-5 in a 12
inning game. 4

Lewis plans to serve up

Lauren Guthrie, Billy Shay,

Larry Carts. and possibly Jim

Silvas as pitchers, but “I’m hop-

ing to see Ignaczak ﬁre too.”

Aside from this humorous out-

Five Return from
Last Year’s Team
That Won 37-44

This maybe the week that
the Panther trackmen win
their ﬁrst dual track meet,
but don’t _count on it. The
Cats meet West Virginia Sat-
urday afternoon at the Sta-
dium. , .
Last "year Pitt thumped West
Virginia 87-44, but the Mounties
are predicting a reversal Saturday.
West Virginia is undefeated in
three dual meets’ this season and
had fair success at the Penn Re-
lays. The Mounties best VMI by
nearly 25 points, a team that has
given them trouble since 1953.

The Mounties are also given
their best chance_to beat Pitt since
1933. Earlier this season Coach

Carl Rees predicted his Panthers

would beat the Mountaineers with-
out too,. much trouble. He may
have reversed that opinion on the
basis of his team’s poor showing
this year. .
Even West Virginia ‘sent a
team to the Penn Relays, some-
thing Pitt failed to do.

L. A. Scout Eyes '6

One Game Hero.
By JIM O’BRIEN
A pro football scout for the
Los Angeles Chargers sat in
a chair in “Beano” Cook’s of-

ﬁce before the Spring intra-

squad game. “Ya know who
the best end on Pitt’s teams
is?” he questioned. '

back.”

“Nope I” the bird dog murmur-
ed with a smug grin.

“Haserl” countered the impa-
tient publicity man. Receiving
another negative reply, he squeal-
ed, “Who? Who? Tell me who?

Hesitating somewhat, as if try-
ing not to divulge his profound
secret, he whispered, “Kuprok.”

“Wha—a—at 1” “Beano” sputtered
in amazement, controting his face’
as though he has just sucked on

“Beano” ﬁred

a lemon. —
Well, the bewilderment of
“Beano” was appropriate in a

way. For the husky senior end
has never even won a monogram

, at Pitt. =

Sees One Game
But the reason the L. A. ivory
hunter was so inspired was be-
cause every year, he sees Kuprok

play one game -- the Spring
game. »
A few minutes later in the

1961 version, Kuprok snagged
ﬁve passes good for 83 yards and
scored a TD to push the Whites

- ahead to stay. I They over- '
whelmed t h e veteran Blue
squad, 20-6.

In 1960, the‘ gentle, blue—eyed
giant blocked a punt and scored
two touchdowns, one with only
18 seconds remaining to play. To
add to the glorious monotony,
he even topped these sterling per-
formances in 1959. He led the
Whites to a 26-20"win, grabbing

I two touchdown passes. Ivan Ton-

cic hurled the, game-winner 50
yards. _

“To know how to hide one’s
ability is great skill,” Rochefou-
cauld, a French courtier and
Moralist once remarked, but Ku-
prok defies his thesis. During the
regular campaign, Kuprok is re-
legated to the anonymityof the
bench, but he blooms once a year

in unison with the daffodils and

Kuprok, who worked in the
foundry of the Mesta Machine
Company during the off season,
hails from Duquesne. In" the
valley of the Monongahela, it is
a rugged industrial town in a
rugged industrial valley.

The small city is built mostly
along a barren hillside above the
smokestacks of the mills that line
the river front. Duquesne seems
to be trying to climb the hillside
to escape the smoke and belch
and the pain of the mills —— and
failing.

Rugged Product

Kuprok, one of the rugged pro-
ducts of Duquesne, likewise is
striving to climb out of the val-
l.ey of the unknown, but he keeps
failing. And he does notwant to
achieve his climb through news-

When asked for an interview,
Kuprok declined, “Uh, uh. I
don’t want it. That guy in the
Press misquoted me and I’m
scared to say anything. I’m in
the doghouse with the coaches
and the other fellas.” ‘

Actually, the coaches have noth-
ing but praise for the capable

terminal. “That boy has every-
thing to be great,” coach Steve
Petro says, “He has good hands,
speed, and a ﬁne physique. It’s
up to him, but he’s so unpredict-
able.”
Just the Opposite

“That’s right,:’ John Michelosen
interrupted, “but dependability is
the key word. In high school he
was a tremendous defensive end,
but now he’s just the opposite.
Quite a turnabout.”

“He has more’ ability than
Mike Ditka,” former end mentor,
Bob Timmons remarked. “He’s
got more potential than (Joe)
Walton, too.” '

Both were Al1—Americans. But
when ‘Michelosen was asked if-
Kuprok will he Woody Haser’s re-
serve next year, Michelosen said,
“No, I wouldn’t say “that.” He left
the answer wide open to conjec-
ture. ‘ I .
,Meanwhile, Kuprok feels that
Haser is one of the best ends in
the ‘country. Does that mean that
he is conceding the position to
Haser. He blurted, “No. I’ll never
stop trying. ‘I’ll do my best.”‘

.Whether he does or not, don’t
be surprised if the Chargers draft

Dear Dr.‘ Frood: My problem is fat, stubby fingers.
As a result, I am exceedingly awkward with my hands.
My manual dexterity is so poor, in fact, that I can't
even get a Lucky pack open. What can I do?

DEAR FINGERS: Simply strap ordinary sewing needles
along both of your index fingers. Now cup the Lucky
pack in your hands, grasp the little red tab i-n your
teeth, and yank. Next, place the pack on a flat surface
and secure it between two unabridged dictionaries.
Then, with the right-hand needle, carefully, carefully
carve a one-inch-square opening at the top right-hand
corner. Finally, place the points of the needles firmly
against the sides of a Lucky and lift. That's all there
is to it. A word of warning though: Try to be careful
