FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11. 1964 A

“. .. . education will never end . . .f’

Chancellor Edward H.
‘Litchﬁeld welcomed what an

: administrator has called the ,

,»7“largest, brightest, geo-
graphically farthest ﬂung
freshmen class” in the Uni-

‘ versity’s history.

5, Litchﬁeld told the record-shat-

_'i.;eﬁng class on Tuesday in the

»"d_:'.arnegie Music Hall that “com-

{F ing to college is a decision to be-

‘F er you must prepare liberally

come a leader, and to be a lead-

and professionally.”

 The Chancellor stressed the

9’ importance of education in this
age of “increasing complexity,
rapidity of change, and increas-
ing volume of burgeonning know-
ledge.

Ltchtd Greets Ne Classes

. . . But some wanted to call it quits after burly burly registration.

Education Never Ends
“Formal education will never
end for you,” he said, “because
if it does, you will stop growing.”

Dr. Litchﬁeld cautioned the
freshmen “not to waste your
resources, to be curious, be an
individual, be skeptical, and
loyal to clear values.”

In explaining the ‘nature of the
institution, Dr. Litchﬁeld said
that a faculty of 1,600 taught 17,-
000 students in the midst of a
capital plant valued at 250 mil-
lion dollars. There are 17 schools
in the University, representing
“one of the widest spectrums of
academic disciplines available

. anywhere in the world today.”

4 Cites Advantages

Advantages of attending a large
urban University such as this, ac-
cording to the Chancellor, in-
clude the availability of a better
faculty, a more cosmopolitan stu-
dent body, and the opportunity to
go from undergraduate school to
professional school in one place.
Disadvantages enumerated in-
clude the “tendency to feel iso-
lated in a large group,” the poor
communication that always exists
in a complex institution.

Speaking optimistically, the
Chancellor spoke of “this time
of greatness for your institu-
tion; the sense of institutional
destiny is-one of the most pow-
erful forces working for us.”

Tuition Payment
Plan Modified  

By NANCY FUCHS
The new deferred tuition plan,“ the errors made on
academic invoices, and the failure of invoices to arrive on
time have caused confusion among students the last few
weeks. In an attempt to clear up the situation, Dr. Alan

' "Rankin, vice~chancellor of student and general affairs, called

a meeting of administrators and students on Wednesday.

In the past, according to Assistant Comptroller Harry
E. Daer, the University has acted as the agent in the de-

3Panthers Face UCLA    A
“n Opening Tomorrow

See Column, Page 1-0 -

The Panthers meet UCLA tomorrow in Pitt Stadium '

in a football game that will test nine new members of the
Coach John Michelosen’s starting eleven. ‘

Although ranked. only ﬁfth in the East, the Panthers
have an offense that might be among the strongest in the

country.

Michelosen does not say much and is usually pessimistic
, when he describes his team. But he did seem satisﬁed- with both
his offense and defense after the ﬁnal scrimmage at Allegheny Col-

lege in Meadville last week.

“It wasa very ﬁne offensive and‘ defensive drill and showing,
but we’ll have to work on timing before the UCLA game.”

The starting line-up after the scrimmage showed the backﬁeld
about as expected. Eric Crabtree and Dale Stewart at halfbacks, Barry
,McKnight at fullback, and Fred Mazurek at quarterback. 

i The line shows no major changes either. Paul Cercel is the cen-

Anthony Heads Linguistics

A new Department of General‘
Linguistics proposing to teach
English as foreign language has
been formed under the guidance
of .a linguistics expert from the
University of Michigan.

Dr. Edward M. Anthony, for-.-.
merly acting director of the Eng-
lish language Institute of Michi-
gan, will coordinate the program
that will shift emphasis from read-
ing and speaking a language to
its form and structure.

Dr. Anthony has supervised
and taught international pro-
grams for the Peace Corps in
Africa, and has served as direc-
tor for English projects in Laos,
Thialand, and Vietnam.

ferred tuition plan. Students were
permitted to pay one-quarter of
their tuition and fees at the be-
ginning of the trimester and the
rest in monthly installments. The
service charge was sixty cents on
$100 every month.

As the agent, the University
had to pay for the books and per-
sonnel involved, representing con-
siderable bookkeeping expense.
Thus Daer explained that it was
a “business-like move”.- on the
part of the University to have
students defer payment of tui-
tion and other fees through The
Tuition Plan, Inc. of New York, a
subsidiary of Commercial Invest-
ment Trust.

Tuition Plan

Tution Plan, Inc., which has ,

arrangements with 700 other edu-
cational institutions, was consi-
dered by the University to be
the best of 20-30 similar. organi-
zations. 'I‘he University request-
ed that information on the Tui-
tion Plan be sent to all- incoming
freshmen, upperclassmen carry-
ing eight or more credits, and
all graduate students on three-
quarters or more residency basis

July 6. Another letter was sent f

with 17,000 registration kits.

speaking‘ for the students, .

John Vrana, president of Stu-
dent Government expressed the
complaint that the second let-
ter was not clear in stating
that The Tuition Plan was re-
placing the Universlty’s deter-
red tnition plan and that stu-
dents were not notiﬁed of the
plan early enough. —

It was also rumored that Chan. - *

cellor Litchﬁeld and Vice-Chan-
celor of Business Aﬁairs Lawr-
ence Monnett were members of
The Tuition Plan’s Board of Di-

rectors. Daer admitted that the ._

letter sent by the University was
not as clear as it should have
been, but stated that neither Mon-

nettt nor the. Chancellor had any — ' T _

dual role in the program: “a
combination -of teaching and ad-
ministration.” More speciﬁcal-
ly, Dr. Martin will be involved
in curriculum planning at the
Institute, since one problem is
the development of a bacca-
laureate program. ’

Dr. Martin noted that Nigeria
has made “signiﬁcant progress
since its independence in 1960,”
but aded that there is “much to
be done in developing an orderly
and competently staffed govern-
ment.” Still he feels, “Nigeria is
one of the most stable govern-

two years at the Institute of Ad-

“has become a resourceful part

Dr. Martin commented, “I

Arts with regret, although I
am excited about the opportun-

In his six years with the
School, Dr. Martin feels it “has
made real progress in the de-

that there isn’t a good deal
more to be done.”

In his welcoming speech to freshmen on
Tuesday the Chancellor stressed the challenges
of leadership and scholarship in this expand-

ing institution. But he wisely tempered the.

limits of his optimism for the incoming stu-
dents with an accurate description of “the ten-
dency to feel isolated in a large group” and
“the pobr communication that always exists in
a complex institution.” A

Nothing better can exemplify the students’
position in the scheme of things than their
most recent challenge registration. This year
complaints about long lines in the Commons
Room were passe; students wailed instead over

‘_the 800-odd invoices that were never sent out

_and the bombshell of the new deferred pay-

ment plan.

When currents of "student dissatisfaction
reached the administration, the student affairs
mediator, assistant chancellor Dr. Alan C. Ban-
kin, called representatives from the Offices of
Student Records and the Comptroller and Dean
of Students Helen Rush to explain to the
president of Student Covemment and the edi-
tor of THE Prrr NEWS the rationale for the
causes of discontent.

They explained ﬁrst that the University
is taking legal action against the printing

.',~ 1

Editorial:   

-' company for ﬁnishing the invoices one month
later than the due date.

Those students who did receive their kits
on time found a vague letter informing them
that the Tuition Plan, Inc. was a good way to

defer tuition payments. Unfortunately it did —

not state that this plan was replacing the Uni-
versity’s previlous deferred tuition plan; it
seemed only another alternative.

The soundness of the Plan itself, as these
_ administrators explained, and the trouble and
money it will save the University are reason

enough for instituting it. But the misunder-

standings caused by insufﬁcient communication
aobut the change were unnecessary and merely
crystalize the position of the students in this
whole business enterprise. --

Student ‘leaders should have been called
in when the plan was first adopted in ]uly so
that they could have at least informed the sum-
mer students of what to expect. If the decision
itself could not have been made earlier so stu-
dents could plan ahead and perhaps decide on
"another alternative of ﬁnancing their educa-
tion, at least the notiﬁcation of the Plan could
have been clear enough and soon enough for
the people it affected.

‘ Posr FACIO explanations accomplish little.

No freshmen student has been
admitted this term, said Dr.
Rankin, who was in the lower
ﬁfth of his high school graduat-
ing class, and two out of every
three freshmen graduated in the
upper ﬁfth.

Of these, 86 were Valedic-
torians and 62 were salutatori-
ans, twice the number of last
year. A

Approximately two -thirds of
all new students are from Penn-

HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN '
EASTERN sports writers have picked the Panthers no

 

better than fifth in the East. They are wrong. These ex-

perts see nothing but dark days ahead for coach John
Michelosen. But the writers overlooked a glimmer of
hope that will burst into full sunshine tomorrow-
That glimmer of hope is the entire first unit.

Experts have been basing their dire predictions
for thePanthers on the basis of heavy losses because
of graduation. Among them, All-American halfback
Paul _Martha and All-American tackle Ernie Bor-
ghetti. The Panthers also lost fullback Rick Leeson,
tackle John Maczuzak, end-s Al Grigaliunas and J o-e
Kuzneski, guards Ed Adamchik and Jeff Ware, and
center Chuck Ahlborn. '

‘ But the experts overlooked the personnel on this
year’s first unit, a unit at least as good as last year’s.
, There is more scoring punch and breakway speed
" on this ﬁrst unit. The ﬁrst unit line is also strong.
ON THE BASIS of the Panther ﬁrst unit, we look for an
8-2 season, with a possible bowl bid.
' Here's why:

ENDS: Right end Bill Howley is the best re-
ceiver on the team. He looked strong at Meadville,
and is fast enough to turn any pass into a score.

Left end Mitchell Zalnasky is virtually untried.
But he is tall ‘(6 ft.-2 in.) and big (210 lbs..). He han-
dles a football like it was radioactive.

TAC’KLES: Both Ron Linaburg and Jim Jones
blocked hard and tackled hard last year. Both should
be ready for their ﬁrst unit assignments.

Jones is surprisingly agile. He has more than_

‘adequate lateral movement for a 265 pounder. No
one will run through him or over him, and it takes
too long to get around him.

GUARDS: One of the strongest positions on the
team. Captain Ray Popp was on the starting team at
the beginning of last season, but an injury slowed
him down, and he spent the rest of the season on
the second unit.

Bernie LaQuinta, the other starting guard,has
good speed and hits hard.

CENTER: Another very strong position. In Paul
Cercel the Panthers have one of the best all-around
centers in the country. Cercel is a hard blocker, and
loves the body contact as much as Liz Taylor.

QU_ARTERBACK: In Fred Mazurek the Pan-
thers might have the best quarterback in the country,
including Roger Staubach. Last year Mazurek com.-
pleted close to 60 per cent of his passes for 950
yards. Not bad for a supposedly inept passer. An-d
Mazurek rushed for another 600 yards.

Mazurek is the best back to play here since Mar-
shall Goldberg playedhere in 1938. By the time Ma-
zurek gets through this season, he could be the best
in Pitt’s history, and the Heismann Trophy winner.

IIALFBACK: Better than last year, and at both
positions. Before the final gun sounds tomorrow,
every football fan except Barbara Martha will have

.  forgotten Paul. Eric Crabtree is faster than Martha,

-and has the potential to be an even more explosive
ruiiner.

 Crabtree has the ability to score from hi's own
one-yard line on a cross buck. He could be-the second-
best back to play here since Goldberg.

At right halfback, Dale Stewart’ is not as explo-

By FRANKSMIZIK

The “T” formation calls
for a quarterback, two half-

backs and a fullback, but I

four years ago Indiana,
Pennsylvania, had a high

 

\ .

school team with three full-  "A

backs and a guard in the 

backﬁeld. Barry McKnight, Jim

Nance, and Dave McNaughton ‘

were the running backs and Jim
Spadafora was the quarterback.

Today, in college, Nance is the I

starting fullback at Syracuse; Mc-
Naughton starts at fullback at
Penn State, and of course Mc-
Knight is the starting fullback
at Pitt. Spadafora is a guard at
the Naval Academy.

Nance was being called the
new Jimmy Brown at Syracuse.
It also seems that Panther root-
ers are trying to make an ana-
logy between McKnight .and Rick
Leeson. Leeson is believed to be
the shiftier of the two, and Mc-
Knight the more powerful. How-
ever, McKnight disagrees.

“When Rick was in his illn-
ior and senior years he knew
every defense that faced Pitt,
this was because he played
much more in his sophomore
year than I did in mine.” Right
now I’m still learning, but as
ﬁar as_ physical potential goes
I can’t say if" I will ever be a
more elusive fullbac ”

In the ﬁnal scrimmage of fall
camp at Meadville, McKnight
looked impressive as he scored
one touchdown and constantly
broke free for substantial gains.
He usually goes through the line
low, close to the ground and the
defense had a hard time hitting
him solidly. '

McKnight is not especially big

' for a fullback at six feet and 205

pounds. In fact at Indiana he
played right halfback. ‘But con-
sidering his few performances
last season and the way he look-
ed in fall camp, he gets a quick
start and is extremely powerful.
Another extremely powerful
fullback for the Panthers this
season is Jim Flanigan. a sopho-
more from North Catholic in
Pittsburgh. Flanigan is much
bigger at six feet two and 220
pounds but like McKnight is
still learning.
McKnight is philosophical about
Flanigan, "welcomes the added
competition. “Jim is big and

individual taste.

strong, but is» just a little bit be-
hind me in experience. I guess
I’ll just have to learn and iin-
prove a littler faster than he does
if I want to stay .as the number
one fullback.” '

If Barry McKnight learns very
quickly and he should surpass
Leeson in stature, the Panther
backﬁeld could be better and
more versatile than last year’s!

sive as Crabtree, but is a strong runner. He will do
more of the inside running, and should balance the
outsi'de running of Crabtree.

FULLBACK: Barry McKight Won’t make any-
one forget Rick Leeson, but McKnight will get the
yardage when it is needed. Although not as good‘ a
runner as the other three backs, McKnight will be
an effective runner with the defense keyed to Mazurek

and Crabtree.

SO THE EASTERN sportswriters pick the Panthers
fifth in the East. But the Panthers have an explosive
ﬁrst unit. Coach Michelosen has a full house on his
ﬁrst unit, and it's on the rise.
If you like to predict scores, try 26-0 this Satur-
day . .. . Keep an eye on third unit halfback Dewey
Chester, and second unit fullback Jim Flanigan.

 ’ UCLA coach Bill Barns brought
Uwith him to Pittsburgh his most
talented team since he started
; " the “T” offense four years ago.
His quarterback will be Larry
'7-Zeno, reputed to be one of the
— jbest triple threat men in the
 country. He, along with end Kurt
‘C. Altenberg, are supposed to be
 the ‘past-catch combination‘ that

will make the Bruins forget their
2-8 record last year.

Altenberg was the Bruins’ sec-
ond best receiver in his sopho-
more year, catching 24 passes for
419 yards and one touchdown.-
He set a UCLA pass receiving
record last year when he caught
eight passes for 166 yards against
the University of Southern Cali-
fornia. '

 

this year.

Another man who hopes to
help the Bruins forget last sea-
son is Mike Haffner, a senior
halfback who has shown top
running form in the practices

In 1961, Haffner set a sopho-
more rushing record gaining 696
yards for a 6.52 rushing average.
This performance earned Haﬁner
the title of “Sophomore of the

 

Year.”

Teaming with Haffner in the
backﬁeld is junior fullback Jim
Colletto. Colletto played in
every game last season, start-
ing in eight of them. He led
the Bruins in rushing last year
with a 3.80 average -for 179
yards.

Left halfback, however, is an
unsure position for the Bruins.

Cornell Champion was a Junior
College All-American, and sup-
posedly has good breakaway speed-
According to UCLA’s Vic Kelley,
Champion has “the quick start,
the balance, and the speed of a
natural halfback.”

The Bruins plan to use a two-

their new system will improve
their record.

Tacklers Must Stop Zeno

To Insure First Victory

The Panthers will have to stop this man, Larry
Zeno, tomorrow at the Stadium. Zeno is a strong run-
ner and passer, and will place-kick for UCLA this year.
Zeno has led UCLA in total olfense for the past two

Last year, Zeno completed 77 out of 154 passes for
1,036 yards and six touchdowns. Zeno is not as strong
a runner, however. Last year he carried the ball 104
times for 166 yards.

would please him more than to beat an Eastern football
