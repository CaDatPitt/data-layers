Ball, May 26‘

Dollar “Reserve” _
Are Placed on Sale;
Total Price $3.50

Use Schenley Ballroom‘

 

Johnny Johnson and his orcl1estra,,

deserting the Hotel Pennsylvania in
New York for one week between ex-
tended engagements, will provide the
music for the Senior Ball, last major
dance of the year.

The announcement was made this
week by James Van Nostrand, Dent.,
-chairman, as “reserve" tickets were
plugged on sale by members of the
senior committee.

The scene of the ball will be the.

Hotel Schenley ballroom, the time,
Friday evening, May 26. Reserve
tickets are being sold at one dollar,
with the balance of $2.50 to be paid,
any time before the dance.

Johnny Johnson, who followed Ted
‘Weems into the Grill Room of the Ho-
tel Pennslvania, wi-ll come to the
‘University campus during a. brief .one-
week, furlough preceding his summer
engagement in the Roof Garden of
-the same hotel. Proof of his popular-
ity with New Yorkers is evidenced in
his re-engagement for the summer
season at the Pennsylvania, Chair-
man Van Nostrand points out.

The ‘Senior Ball will mark the ﬁrst
appearance of this young band master
on the Pitt campus. Johnson, in the
past few years, has ﬁlled engage-
ments at Asbury Park, Atlantic City
and other eastern entertainment cen-
ters.

As the headliner at the Pennsyl-
vania Maestro Johnson has been fea-
tured by the National Broadcasting
Company in the late evening dance
broadcasts, playing an average of
four nights each week. He brings
his company of eleven musicians and

, -ent.ertainers for the,Senior Ball.

‘Van Nostrand and his committee to-
day were hinting of plans for a. deco-
rative scheme for the Senior Ball
which, “in all seriousness,” would
surpass previous attempts of this kind
here. A design of a decorative plan
was submitted to the committee and
approved last week. Work on the
construction of settings was to begin
early next week, Van Nostrand inti-
mated.

A program design, in keeping with
the decorative scheme of the ball, al-
ready has been approved by the com-
mittee.

Board To Appoint Heads of
News, Panther, Owl

Candidates for major positions on
student publications are now making
appointments for interviews next
Tuesday, Vvednesday and Thursday
afternoons with the Board of Publica-

tions. The board consists of Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women;
Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of

men, and William S. Maulsby, head
of the journalism department. The in-

terviews will take place in Heinz
House.
Any - »undergraduate student,‘ of

either sex, is eligible for any of the
positions to be ﬁlled at this time on
the News, Owl, and Panther. The
board considers grades, experience,
not necessarily on the publication in-
volved, and character as essential
qualiﬁcations.

Each candidate has been invited to
submit a detailed program for carry-
ing out his ideas for bettering the
publication he is most interested in.
A candidate may apply for as many
positions as he. cares to.

It was pointed .out by Mr. Maul-sby
that the positions to be ﬁlled this
spring are not necessarily those now
in existence. That is, the board is
willing to consider applications for
chairman of any publication; if the
board is favorably impressed by an
applicant, he can name his own title.

the board has original jurisdiction are
the chief executive ones on the edi-

iorial and business sides of the News,‘

Ordinarily, positions on the Owl are

given to students who are now second-

Panther or News are likely to go to.

The board, however, in the past. has
been receptive to new ideas from-

Druid Officers 
Defend Election

 

Charge Robbins. With Inaccuracy,
Unethical Conduct

 

Challenging the denouncement of
Druids, honorary sophomore activities
fraternity, made by Irving D. Rob-
bins, Col. '35, who resigned at the
close of Sunday’s election meeting,
when it became apparent that candi-
dates he had sponsored were not
elected, ofﬁcers of thefraternity to
day charged Robbins with unethical
conduct and inaccuracies in stating
that members other than himself had
withdrawn from the meeting. Rob-
bins’ resignation was ofiicially recog-
nized by acceptance yesterday.

In a joint statement given the News

for publication, Joseph F. Novak and
Jules L. Green, president and secre-
tary, respectively, of Druids, refute
Robbins’ statement that the election
meeting was a “farce” and a “bur-
lesque,” asserting that it “was run
as orderly as any meeting could be
until Mr. Robbins, without any basis
for protest, accused the members of
not electing men whom HE thought
most worthy." _
A‘ ‘The ofﬁcers'also deny the: truth of
Robbins’ assertion that three men
withdrew from the meeting upon an-
nouncement of the newly-elected can-
didates, holding that Robbins was the
only member to withdraw.

For revealing in a public statement
the secret methods of Druid election,
Novak and Green regard Robbins’
action as “an entirely indiscreet and
unethical move.” They further charged
him with failing “to consider the feel-
ings of the men who will be tapped
today," stating that he will have giV8I1
them the feeling that they were not
..outstanding, but mediocre men.‘_ This
they denied.

“Battle of Music’
At Grotto Club.
From 9 To 1

The applause of an anticipated
crowd of 800 couples will decide the
winner of a four-hour battle of music
between two eleven-piece orchestras
tonight at the Spring Festival Sports
Dance. Beginning at 9 o’clock all the
huge Grotto Ballroom on the North-
side, the ﬁrst and only all-University
dance of the year will ring down the
curtain on a week crowded with
springtime festivities.

The Bert Weidenheimer
Orchestra and Rosenberg’s Col-
legians of Youngstown, Ohio, will
take turns in playing the music for
dancing. The former orchestra is a
well-known local unit having furnish-
ed the music for a number of campus
dances in the past season._ Rosen-
berg’s group, composed of graduates
of Grove‘City College, are~now play-
ing at. the-- Youngstown ‘Chatterbox;
previous bookings included stands in

At intermission tonight the tradi-
tional presentation of the gigantic
University spoon will be made by Dan
Smith Eng. ’33, chairman of Spring
Festival Week. Leroy Lewis, Col.
’34, next year's football manager and
an outstanding member of the Iiunior
class, will accept the symbol for his
cl-ass. This spoon, which made its
first appearance in 1871, has been
passed along each year, with the ex-
ception of a number of years when
it was missing. Since its disappear-
ance and consequent recovery, it has
been under the personal -guard of J.
G3 Quick, University’ registrar, It
is about five feet in length.

Other awards which will be made
at the dance include the thirteen
trophies to the winners and runners-
up in the Sweepstakes and Track
Meet, the ﬁrst three place winners in
the Float Parade, and to the victori-
ous fraternities in the following
events: the special 880-yard relay of
the Track Meet, the hoop race, the
roller-skating relay, and the scooter-
relay.

Tickets for the dance will be on

tonight. However, all students pur-

sent their registration cards, it was
declared by the office of the dean of
men. .

The dance is ‘strictly a sports af-
fair. Ansel McCamant, Dent. ’33,
cliairman, stated that the correct at-
tire for tonight covers such things
as white ﬂannels, sport dresses, buck
shoes, knickers, linen suits, and
other springtime dress modes.

The ballroom is located at 107 East
Montgomery avenue. It is of sufficient
capacitty to accommodate more than
2,000 dancers, so, despite the large
turnout expected Ior the affair, a,
crowded floor will not hamper danc-
mg.

Dance center around the score of
many colored spotlights bordering the

more than thirty different color com-

Inquiry Speaker Outlines General
Theories to End Crisis

 

“This depression is diiferent from
ii“ Othel” mecedins ones. and ideas
used in previous depressions cannot
lie used In solving the present prob.
em; . declared DI‘.   Turner,
associate. professor of history, before
the Inquiry Forum Wednesday after-
noon. Dr. Turner spoke on “Theories
on the end of the Depression" and
0U§11{1ed the various plans of national
relief.

The Speaker- pointed out two funda-
mental types or reasonnig in regard
to the depression. The ﬁrst, he said
looks toward merely a, recovery of
busmess through either a natural
movement of the economic cycle or
through minor adjustments to the
economic machine, The second idea,
relates to_ the breakdown of capitalism,
and entails a major change in present
organization.

“Recovery. to follow the ﬂr-st theory,‘

can be achieved by various methods,"
said the history professor, “Opening
of investment opportunities, economy
and a. balanced budget, debt reduction,
international monetary stabilization,
inﬂation. public works, or another
great utilitarian invention will, it is
claimed. restore trade."

Under the second theory, Dr. Tur-.
ner pointed to the proposed regulation
oi? Genital issues as a. moderate re-
form, the consolidation of business’
under such a program as the Swope
Plan, socialism—-the nationalization of
basic industries, or even a. revolu-
tionary change.

Interfrqternity Handbook
Will Be Completed Soon

 

The fraternity handbook, sponsored
each year by Interfraternity Council
as an aid to freshmen in making their
choice of fraternities, will be prac-
tically completed before the end of
the present semester, according to
Charles Foreman, Col. '35, editor of
the booklet.

Questionnaires have been sent to
all men’s fraternities by Foreman and
his staff, which, when ﬁlled out, will
give extensive information as to the
aims, accomplishments, and position.
on campus of each Greek letter group.
Foreman has urged an early return of
these question sheets.

Festival Dance Tonight  
Ushers In Social Season

 

Expect 800 Couples At Grotto; Two Orchestras To Play; Tickets at
$1.50 Per Couple To Be Sold At Door; Will Award
Cups, Distribute "Razz Rag”

 

The weatherman may or may not knowwhat he’s talking about.
And the fact that black and white shoes are getting a big play, that
the tennis team has played a few matches, and that seniors are

extremely conscious of “the day’

’ and emplojnnent prospects, may

or may not signify anything. But the fact that tonight marks the

date of the Festival Sports Dance

deﬁnitely and conclusively proves

that “Spring has officially came, tra la.”

Tappees to eight honorary fraterni-%

ties will ﬁnd it an opportune time to
celebrate when they mingle with 800
dancing couples at the Grotto Club.
At a cost of $1.50, the lowest yet,
dancers will choose the musical win-
ners after a competition between the
eleven-piece bands of Bert Weiden-
heimer and Rosenberg’s Collegians.
One of Tin Pan Alley’s noble ef-
forts, “The Grass Is Growing Green-
er All the Time," will probably be
the theme song of the affair.
Awarding of cups won during the
Festival events, distribution of Dave
Lewis’ latest. brain child, the “Razz
Rag,” and the passing along of the
traditional senior spoon will all take
place at the intermission. Playing
of “Good Night, Ladies” (or wliatever
piece both bands know and agree to

give at the end) will ring down the
curtain on a week chock full of fes-
tivities. 1

Since the winners of the ﬁve events
on this afternoon's program will not
he announced until tonight, it's a
sure thing that all the Greeks will be
there to grab off more precious metal
for the pledges to keep_sl1ining.

Ansel McCa.mant, chairman. and his
committee covering all schools of the
‘University, have everything rea.dy,
including a number of novel decora-
tive features, for the anticipated
crowd tonight. '

Next Friday night will have its big
affair, too, when the Grotto Ballroom
again houses a Pitt Da.nce. The Col-
lege Association semester formal,
scheduled from 9 to 1, is expected to
draw a large membership out to the
North Side, while Dick Gaertner’s
eleven-piece XVJAS orchestra occu-
pies the band platform.

Tickets for the formal can be pur-
chased from any of the committee

weather is favorable. The present
record is 1253.5, and Keller ran the

tries in the middle distance races are

A friend of CHESTERFIELD writes us of

a salesman who had “something to say”:

"I dropped. into :1 little tobacco shop,

and when  asked for a pack of Chest-

eriields the man smiled and told me I

was the seventh customer without a
break to ask for Chesterﬁelds. ‘Smoker
after smoker,’ he said, ‘tells me that

Chesterﬁelds click . . . I sell five times
as many Chestcrﬁelds as I did a while

back.’ ”

Yes, there’s something to say about Chest- A

‘ erfieids and it takes. just six words to say

Wherever you buy
Chesterﬁclds,you get
them just as fresh as
if you came by our
factory door

\\:r2/

it-—"They’re mild and yet they satisfy.”

SI’I1.A1s.ING at a convention of i1cu.spa.pc1 publishcis 111 1.1.“ oils.
‘ City Colonel McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune, ac-
; * ' ‘ . _
cuscd eastern colleges and u}11V'€I‘S1t1eS of fostering doctrines of .1 dd-
ical political and economic thought. Colonel McCormick, we believe,
- ' ' ' v u I . J‘
has attributed a growing real.1zat.1on among 11I1(lG1.g‘IaClll2l‘lveS of die
fate that awaits them after graduation to a changed political theory
mnong them, which is hardly the case.
As Dean Sicg of the University recently said in an interview,
uiidcrgraduates today are not the “collegiate” individuals they were
. - ‘1 " -.
four years ago, but the change has been only skin deep. Stuclcnts
are feeling the pinch of the depression, and in many cases feeling it
very hard. It is altogether na't.ura.1 that, being subjected to hard-
ships which thcy never before knew, they should begin asking them-
selves the reason.
But it is certainly true that the new attitude is only skin deep.
To believe that undergraduates of the average university have
changed fundamcnta,l1y, or can, in their intellectual make-ups, is to
credit them with a more serious outlook than they ever deserved.

On the other hand, however, the present about-face has been
wide spread. A larger number of students has been affcctecl "than
were, for instance, during the period of Mencken cynicism in the
twenties. That movement, publicized as it was, after all only ap-
pealed to campus intellectuals. It was 11ot geiieral. Today’s reac-
tion._.is._.,.among intellectuals.aud.plain collcgiaiis alike, for the vic-
tims of the depression have not been chosen discriminatcly.

In few cases has the reaction taken a form that could truly be
called radical. The Marxists are few and far between. Instead of
accepting whole heartedly some theory, students have shown an in-
terest, and not much else. Their “radicalism” is still in a forum-
tive state. Its fruition is far off and doubtful.

For the graduate of June 7, the future is gloomy. And knowing
it, his reaction has been an unusual interest in public aﬁfairs. This
3'ear’s crop of job hunters with degrees will be politically minded.

Too many of last year ’s graduates have returned with stories of
washed out expectations to allow present seniors to forget that there
is no more college after J unc. A job is an imperative need for the
ZPitt inhn or"-'w'o'in"an.’*‘Oui‘ student body is drawn from lower middle
‘class homes in which 2:. college education means sacriﬁce. Pitt stu-
dents look forward to the day they find cmployinent, and pay back
the obligation they have assumed in drziiiiing none too full family
bank accounts.

Radicalism has not sprung up and spread over night during the
depression. But among college students, as among all other classes,
the pcceptaiice without questions of tliiiigs as they are is no longer
to be assumed.

Revise The Rules !

LAST FRIDAY'S election. it is to be hoped. has set a precedent in
student affairs. Through the efforts of Theodore Biddle, assist-

ant to the dean of men, the fraud and attempted fraud t.ha,t marked

elections.-of . f0I‘II10I""_V‘B3.'I‘S_ wasrrediicedvto an-V ideal“-‘ minimum. ,

Unfortunately there has been no guarantee that campus groups
have permanently deserted tactics that made elections in former
years a farce, with the results always known before the ballots were
cast. Continued vigilance by the authorities is necessary.

But more important. is. that all politics he kept in the open. The
high number of ballots cast in last week's election indicated that
when the political situation  brought forth in its true light, greater
interest is evidenced in elections by the student body. Had the
voting students had a picture of the situation clariﬁed by past ex-
perience withn-mo-re‘or-.lcss-f‘op.ciily competitive” ﬁeld, the results
of the balloting might have been surprisingly different.

For the ﬂrst time, it seems, the independent voter, the formerly
disinterested student, rallied to the cause of a clean and uncon-
trolled election. Ballot-box stuffing and similar fraudulent devices
were virtually wiped out. This, perhaps, because such means were
unnecessary with so little opposition. But mild iiitiinidaﬁon and
“blind” voting in an adherence to slated candidates yct remained.

The way, at least, has been paved toward a system of open and
honest competition. The present system of “grab all you can” will
best be brought under control by the gro "th of a healthy, honestly
motivated political opposition. Why not have that happen Iiow‘.?

. Unlessthis is done, there» can be no point in continuing a gov-
erning body which seems to interest boy politicians only when the
time comes to appoint a dance chairman.

Is it too late now to call of re-

Germany a chance to" stage the conic-

is. And meanwhile she is overrun by

International Group Will
Give Open House May 26

The newly formed Interna.tional
Council. an oi'g:-iiiizatioii formed of
i'cpi‘cscntntives of the various na-
tionality groups on the czmipiis. will
give an “lnteinatioiial Open House”
at the Heinz House Friday, May 26.
at 8 o'clock. Invitations are extended
to all students zitteiitliiig the Univer-
sity and their friends.

The purpose of the “open house.” is
to further the spirit of friendship
which rose among the nationality
groups while working together for the
nationality rooms of the Cathedral of
Learning.

A committee under the leadership
of. Leo A. Giitoski and W’i11iain Potter
has prepared a tentative program,
which promises an unique and enjoy-
able affair. Invitations will be sent
to all consulates and proininent per-
sons in various nationality groups

will be cliarged.

modyern-minded individuals, including
some of the greatest men of our time
as “pa<-iﬁsts” or “Reds?” Such teach-
ings, particularly since they are of the
vintage of 1918, glorify War, any kind
of war, make professional ﬂag wavers
and patriotcers; and propagate medie-
val ideas of civilization. If college

we have yet to hear of it.

Yet, it is for the upkeep of such a
useless and mischievous kind of teach-
ing thal; the University proposes to
starve the libraries, the laboratories
and the scientiﬁc and liberal facul-
tics!

This is not a. protest, per so. It is
-.1 ,_coniinenta_ry upon_ a_._,phenomenon
that is gradually making the Univer-
sity thc laughing stock of most intel-
ligent members of society. As a. com-
mentary this letter cannot urge that
ever futile move for a. direct and un-
obscured sampling of student opinion
upon such a. policy as is contemplated.
It merely notes the absurdity of it,
and does that with 3. realization that
nothing will be done about the sit-
nation

Supplession of News

And why all this touchincss over
the foreign correspondents in Ger-
main’? The Ainerican writers, ‘of
course, put up 3. good, big bluff, and
caine out on the right end. But in-
timidation of them was attempted. It
seems strange that Russia has noth-
ing -to fear in this matte.r._ Many
dispatches, unfavorable to the Soviet
leave Moscow every day. Russia, ap-
parently, has nothing to hide.

Were it not that human being are
concerned, the Nezi stand on the
Jewish qiiestiqn would be downriglit
'1‘21ugliaLl5lc‘. " Their incoiisisteiiciés are
only outdone by their Ainorican
friends. ’ -

By official edict Jewish lawyers
and jurists have been barred from
the courts. Jewish professors have
been thrown out of the universities.
Surgeons and physici:-ins are ousted
from hospitals and denied the right
to practice. These men, and they
are many, are denied the good,'o1d
right to earn 21 living, as have been
the business men subjected to the
boycott. That is the simplest. form
of persecution known. It does not iii-
volve “rights.” But it does take away
the bread, meat, and celery.

The Little Pogrom Game

There is also the rather tiresome
argiimeiit over the 1)OgI‘_0n1 that fol-
lowed I-Iitlei"s'“ a'pp"o"in'tment tolthe
Chancellorship. Reports of the po-
grom have been many. And even if
their treatise be divided by two, the
fact of riotous persecution still re-
mains. Hitler had been promising
his hoodlums the chance to pull that
stunt for some years now. Jew-bait
ing was point niinibcr one in his pro-
gram for the economic rehabilitation
of Germany. And if the Nazis did
not run wild the day they took power,
they were awfully well disciplined
boys. which is another thing that no
unintoxicated gentleinzin or lady can
believe.

Then there is that yarn about the
really German Jews being treated
with all due donsideration, the real
objecl: of the Nazi prejudice -being
the Polish Jew. More tripe.

You can. believe this stuff if you try
hard enough. But I hardly think fit
worth the effort." Einsteiii ha.sn’t left
the Fatherland for his health exactly.
And Bruno Walter has not been for-
bidden to conduct because his. knowl-
edge of music is meager.

Hitler is suppressing the political
opposition, the trade union, and the
Jew. And the apologists may scream
tlieir heads off from now until the
utilities give fair rates. and he still
will he a. scoundi-el. It is difficult, of
course, to account for such delusion
and dream among a. people who have
bertoifore demonstrated an intellect-
iial development which, compared to
that of other industrial populations,
is somewhat advanced.

The Responsibility

I believe that a very nice indict-
ment for the respoiisibillty can be
brought against two politicians of
great repute. They are two gentle-
men who in post-war madness formu-
lated the Treaty of Versailles.
Clemenceau and Lloyd George hood-
winked poor \Vilsoi1 into agreeing to
a harness for Germany which, had it
not produced a Hitler, would have
mroduced someone exactly like him.
They made a, salty juice for Germany.
But the catch in it is that their own
peopleiwill now stew in it.

May 2, 1933.
To the Editor, Pitt News:

Spcul-zing officially, and in behalf of
more than tw-0-‘thirds of the members
of Druids. we challenge the fallacies
made by Irving D. Robbins, in the
May. second issue of the Pitt News,
concerning the spring election of men
into Druids.

The meeting which Mr. Robbins as-
serted to be a “farce” and “burlesque"
was run as orderly as any meeting‘
could possibly be until Mr. Robbins,
without any basis for protest, accused
the members of not electing men
whom he thought most worthy. Per-
haps Mr. Robbins is under the im-
pression that a. group should deter-
mine its policies through the opinions
of one, and not through those of the
majority. The election was carried
out In the manner speciﬁed by the
constitution and was attended for the
greater part by Theodore W. Biddle,
faculty adviser of Druids. It is not
our purpose to expose the method of
election used by Druids, for, it being
an honorary and seci'e_t organization,

One-Act Plays

Members of Carl R Ca.ss’s play pro-
ducing class will present the first of
the ﬁnal series of one-act plays, on
Tuesday evening at the Fanny Edel
Falk E1.eincntary ‘School. a.uditoi_'i'um
at 8 o’clock. This is the third series
of one-act plays produced this year.

Jean Stotler, Col. '33, will direct
“The Thing,” by Percival Wilde, in
which the role of “A Man” will be
portrayed by Aron Levenson, and “A
Thing” will be played by Marquis An-
derson. The play deals with the last
desperate struggle of a man with his
conscience.

The cast of “Council’s Opinion is:
Stella, Agnes Calabrese, Bus. Ad. '35;
Lady Cynthia, Rose Ball, C01. '34;
Frazer, George Strong, Col. '36; Philip,
_,,.I,ohu Roman, Col. ’36; Sir Lothoir,
"John V‘/yeth, Col. '35; and “P1um”

wp ,_thing guch an expomire would be,

course of the election, but rzither
after the names of the elected moni-
hers had been 1LIlll0L1IlCe(l that ‘Mr.
Robbins protested. VVe have alvv-.i_vs
been under the impression that so
long as any game, whether it be buse-
ball, tennis, or elections, is run ac-
cording to the speciﬁed rules, there
can be no basis for protest.

Mr. Robbins also quoted that three
members withdrew from the meeting
upon oniiouiiceinent of the ’na.mes"of
the iiewlyclectcd canclidates. VVe
wish to correct this stateinent by say-
ing‘ that he was the only member who
did so.

\Vl1a't we have just mentioned may
or may not prove to the student body
that the Druid elections, although the
men elected were not acceptable to
Mi‘. Robbins, were done with the ut-
most consideration and honesty. But
this is not the most iinportant factor
involved. The iniportant matter is
the fact that a member of this 03.‘-
gaiiization, which is a secret one, ex-
posed to the student body its method
of elec-.tion--an entirely indiscreet and
unethical’ move. He also failed to
consider the feelings of the men who
will be tapped today. He will have
given them the feeling tliat they were
,not oiitstanding, but mediocre men.
lit is zit this point that we wish to as-
sure those men who will be tapped
today that they are outstanding in
(‘.l1{-l.1"¢l(',l;€:1‘, scholarsliip and leadership.
Druids extends to them its heartiest
coiigratiilations. ’

Druids, ofﬁcially, accepts the resig-
nation of ‘Irving 1). Robbins, who, it
feels, is not in spirit with its func-
tions. The theory that the iiiajority
ru1es"is a we1l'est“ablished axiom,‘ and
any organization that can be swayed
by the voice of a siiigle person, which
is the direct antithesis of the majority,
is unstable. Druids is not such an

Looking at Oakland
Willi spring here again and the returning leaves bl.oomiug

i‘g.i:cci1 avenues of mist over the district, Oakland becomes a plcas:.iiit-

or place to look at. It was bad in winter. The beauty and impres-

distance. America, at least, has do-
velopcd the skyscraper mid :2 flinc-
tional and utilitarian attitude toward
‘c1.l'(:llIl'.eClLll1‘e. Where wea.lL£i was once
directed toward realizing :1 city‘s ur-
chitecture in terms of the past, it
might now be tuiji1ed‘,towzii;,rl perfect-
ing the new." Style‘ follows where
money flows. Contrasts are given
where satisfactioii can be gained.
The accent should be set I-’)1‘ our own
age.

But it is 3. discouraging fact to see
the same bungling still going on
around us. The project of the new
Mellon Institute offered a remarkable
opportunity for a modern a'rchit,ect.ur-
al creation——-a. science i-eseuicii inbor-
atory, most peculiar, most specialize-:1
eleineiit of our machine. civilization——
and we see it growing under our eyes
into a ponderous imitation of a Greek
temple! Perhaps the great columns

bulk than beauty, or showing in a
lack of harmony the cluttered pick-
ings from all parts of the world. For
despite the wealth of modern capi-
talisin sunk into the Oakland project,
liardly 21 building strikes one as
worthy or representative of contem-
porary, urban civilization.

Now Oakland is less dismal to look
at from the hill. Shaded off evenly
from the green below, the tops of
‘buildings éii'e7l1ess‘ga11n.t, less intru-
sive. But it does not help much. The
fact of their ugliness remains. No
few hundred trees and teri'a.ced grass
plots can obliterate bad architecture
——the monotonous Schenley Hotel,
distinguished for its fashionable ad-
dress and for looking more like a.
barn in stone than any other build-
ing in the district; Memorial Hall,
evidently built with the vague inten-
tion in someonc’s mind of recreating
the Masoleum of Halicariiassus, im-
pressive iii spite of ﬁlth, but looking,
nevertheless, like some neolithic
monster that squatted there ages ago

they do look ﬁne in the slnntiiig sun-
light; but they are only surface. non-
functional. mere _ori12i._meiits, thought-
fully placed to ci'it"oi‘f 'a"'large sliarc
of illumiiiation.

On our Cathedral we can look with
more favor. It, at least, realizes
symbolically its intention, a. tower of
a.s1)ii'ation., a. modern skyscrapcin
Despite its use of gothic oriiamcnta-
-tion, it is by far the most impressive
building in the city. But one can not
even be optimistic about the interior.
What a. conglomerate bee hive of old
world relics will look like is discour-
aging to thinking upon. For with
all your Dutch Rooms, Greek Rooms,
German Rooms, accumulated through
forty stories, something shzirply re-
sembling a museum cannot be cs-
caped.

Even this building is far from
making the break that would mark
it truly representative of our time.
The things of the old world are ours
only in respect to how 'wo'can use
them to our own ends. Such use of
them is sidestepping the issue, or, at
most, merely patching it up.

And so we cannot help wishing for
something more truly our.o§_vn. Right
now it looks rather hopeless. It is
easier to move a block of slums than
to obliterate a stone heap like the
Mosque for something 01' Teal beauty-
But what opportunities in new build-
ing projects remain we hope will
point forward. Even at that, though,
the projected Heinz Memorial Chapel
will doubtless rise, buttress against
buttress, spire balancing spire, just
as innuineraible chapels in Europe
rose five hundred years ago!

and Qssiﬁed.

The Mosque across the street is,
without doubt, the most uiipardoiitible
atrocity this side of the river. No
building ~iii~i;ended<« for an auditorium
could have missed its purpose more

the footlights and the voice of the
most fulminating speaker rockets
about the roof or treinbles and dis-
solves in the eleventh row. Tliei'e is
as much of the true East about it as
:1 drug store sheik. _ ,

Fortunately the Carnegie brown-
stone school of architecture has
made few inroads, though even at
that we have a consuminate example.
Often we have wondered what color
stone lay under the inches of dirt on
the museum. Old men tell of sonic-
thing fair and pleasant to look at in
the sunlight. But to us that is sound
and fury, who see only the bastard
outlines, heavy, squat, almost wholly
gloomy. And the park can do little
to help, spreading acrossia ravine
that is sooty and cluttered with
slums.

All of this might be excused on the
score that the buildings are old.
They belong‘ to a. period that ante-
dates ours—a time. of haste, expan-
sion, when a. roof meant a roof, and
beauty was realized in adulteraicd
reproductions of old world art. The
Masonic Temple tries hard to look
