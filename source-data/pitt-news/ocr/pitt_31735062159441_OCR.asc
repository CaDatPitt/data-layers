‘Sweater Racket’ Rea ppears Here,
Old Game Fleeces Local Students

The "sweater racket” operators who have been plaguing Pitt
students during the past twelve months has cropped up especially
strong in the period from the start of the Christmas recess to the

present. .

Set Ton’ ght
Two stained-glass medallions
honoring the late Josiah KirbyLilly,
founder of the Foster Hall collec-
tion, will be dedicated tonight as
part of the twenty-third, annual
Stephen Foster Memorial program to
be held in Foster Hall at 8:15 p.m.
The medallions, to be placed in
the windows of the lobby, are gifts
of the Tuesday Musical Club and
the Foster Hall staff. The work of
Howard G. Wilbert of the Pittsburgh
Stained Glass Studios and designer
of several Cathedral of Learning
windows, the medallions commemo-
rate the themes of music and drama.
Sponsored on alternate years by
the Tuesday Musical Club and the
University, the program this year
is under the chairmanship of Mrs.
Lewis E. Young, president of the
Club. Representing the University
tonight will be Mrs. Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald, wife of the Chancellor, and
Helen P. Rush, dean of women.
Mrs. Fletcher Hodges ]r., wife of
the curator of Foster Memorial, will
speak on the collection.
Both the program and the recep-
tion following are open to the public.

Owl Promised
By Tap Day

The 1950 Owl will be delivered
on Tap Day this year, two months
earlier than last year's book, ac-
cording to the Owl staff.

As a result, orders for the year
book will have to be paid earlier.
The deadline set for the final pay-
ment has been announced by Renee
Friedman, editor, as January 27.

Deposits can not be returned if
the final payment has not been
made by that date because mater-

ials are ordered by the Owl Staff as
soon as the order is placed.

Each student owing a balance
will be mailed a statement within
the next week informing him of the
“no payee ~ no bookee" sale plan.

Approximately 2,100 books have
been sold to date. Editor Friedman
stressed the fact that yearbook
sales are continuing although por-
traits cannot now be placed in the
book.

that the operators fleeced Pitts-
burgh district "suckers" of thou-
sands of dollars. According to J.K.
Orr of the BBB, about fifteen com-
’gl_aints were received from Pitts-
burghers who had been approached
or actually bitten on the racket.
While no Pitt students reported at
the Bureau, unofficial complaints
have been periodically received at
the Pitt News office.

Standard Procedure

Orr estimated, however, that the‘
Bureau receives only about "1 or
2% of a complaint on any one item."
This would add up to a thriving bus-’
iness of between 750 and 1500 cus-
tomers for the men who sell cheap
sweaters at premium prices.

"Sweater racket” procedure has
been fairly well standardized by
now. As outlined by Orr,the "sales-
man" rolls up to the curb in an
automobile, and leans out to ask
something to the effect of "Hey,
Bud, what size sweater (or jacket)
do you wear?", or “are you inter-
ested in a bargain?"

He then hauls out an expensive
sweater and an explanation. "I just
bought outa factory ata killing and
we've got these sweaters dirt cheap}
More often it's “We're making de-
liveries for Smith's Department
Store and just found out that the
store gave us an extra sweater.
Now we don't want to take the
sweater back and we’dlike to make
a little money on it.”

Low Price Offered

He names what is plainly a low
price for the quality of the material.
After the sale is concluded, the
operator brings out a boxed sweater
of “the correct size,” collects the
money, and drives away leaving the
buyer with a cheap sweater worth
far less than the original “low
price.”

The clean ofmen’s office has been
working on the racket since it ap-
peared at Pitt last year. It seems
‘to appear in cycles of one or two
years. Dean of Men T.W. Biddle
and Placement Director Charles
Ebert have been especially active.

License Numbers Caught ’

Dr. Theodore M. Finney, head of
the department of music appreci-
ation, was the last prospective vic-
tim reported at Pitt. Dr. Finney
turned the man down, then copied
the license plate number, "6YA9.

Corridors Prove

Hard to Break

Students are stillhesitant about
using the yawning white “short-
cut” corridors on the ground floor.
An electrician told a Pitt News
reporter from his perch on alddder
Friday afternoon that the place
was as lonely as a “lover's,lane
in the daytime.”

While he was working on the
wiring for the modern circular flu-
orescent lights which will light
the corridors, several, students,
peering curiously, stopped and
asked questions about the little
rooms near the entrances. Working
up courage to try their luck, no
doubt.

Late afternoon strollers seem

tling lunch-hour students, who
don't seem to be willing to take a
chance on getting lost.

The corridors start between the
‘elevators and the check room.
One branch is an exp’ress to the
Blue Tuck Shop, and the other

«To Begin This Year

Construction on George Hubbard Clapp Science Hall on the
Cathedral of Learning campus will probably be under way in earn-

Completion of this $3,700,000 building will carry ctnstruction

1950. This will leave the remainder
ofthe Medical Center'l_;uildin.gs plus
the libraries and Student Center to

ing plans, actual dates are still
indefinite. lngham, Boyd,and Pratt,

Changes in plans for both these
buildings caused early delay in
construction plans. At the start of
the semester it was discoveredthat
blueprints for the Nurses .Home
would have to be altered to provide
for a smaller structure than was
originally proposed.

teams could practice.

When Hamilton arrived on the Pitt

letic officials are now especially
interested in providinga 7000-seat
arena for the basketball team.

Center Attention There

A ll Student Congress, noted this season more for its heated wrang-
ling than its accomplishments, has a chance to turn some of its
I-heat and eloquence toward something constructive in which the
backing of the student body is sure to be unanimous. ‘

We refer to the current campaign directed at securing an ad-
*eqLi,ate student recreation center, originally planned as part of the
building campaign.

ii _ Just about every person in the city has been made to feel that
- he'has somepart in the coming expansion of the University. Every-
one, that is, except the student. The planning and building of a
student center could well be ,’in no small part, a sort of student
project in which every Pittite could consider himself a contri-
.butor. A L
Student Congress, as the titular voice of the students, is over-
:looking"both a duty to its constituents and an opportunity ,,.,for it-
'..,,-‘self in ignoring the problem.

Perhaps the committee chosen to investigate the News might
be,»put to better use if its efforts were turned toward obtaining
from the planners sometidea of» when students can expect what in
the form of a center. They might even get to write a letter of pro-
test to the deans. '

,j,Privilege Abused

 The newly-installed Student Congress suggestion boxes are
"very popular with students. Trouble is their popularity is not
the kind Congress planned. The boxes were instituted as a means
forfthe‘ students to go on record in Congress. Instead many stu-
dents have made them a big joke. '

tThe yield of the boxes .after their first week on the walls
_ justifies the latter statement. Q ‘
Of the 60 forms found in the boxes, only 14 were properly
,_ signed and useful to Congress. Eight of these 14 were duplicates.
/The rest of the 60 forms contained some of the "vilest com-
ments” that chairman Jack Lindsey had ever read. A

, In fact, Lindsey said that some of the forms ‘were so un-
ehaste that 'I' wouldn't even let the Panther staff read them.” An-
other popular use of the forms is for scratch pads and "Gin”
scores. During the first week, 200 were wasted in these ways.

,Pharmacy School, which has been bemoaning its lack of re-
presentation in Congress, turned in 16 forms, all worthless.
A The above facts are not nice things to be readingjabout sup-
posed college-level students." In a university as large as Pitt,
the suggestion box is one of the most effective ways of finding
» what students expect of their legislature‘. Even though all stu-
T dents are invited to Congress meetings, the size of Congress’
“chambers and the size of the student body makes this imprac-
ticable. A
V ,}_The students who are abusing this privilege are certainly
harming their more sensible counterparts. If Congress were to
discontinue use of the boxes’ it would erase one of the best things
—~ they have done\thi,s year. The fact is that they are not going to
;/discontinue them. We hope that those _students who. have been
childish in their _misuse will realizethat they have grown up and
B ‘discontinue their wholly objectionable practice.
‘ A If the students follow the lead of Ellsworth Center and State
Hall, where the most good suggestions have come from, the sug-
gestion boxes can be a credit both to students and to Congress.

With the new year only a week
old, we can see that the low over-

V head fad of 1949 will reach monster

proportions in 1950. It might eve
extend to this university. a

Yes, the plain pipe racks and no
fancy fixtures will probably hit our
noble institution any day now. It
will make a different place out of
the Cathedral. Whether the change
will be for the better or otherwise
-— who knows?

The building program will be, of
course, the first thing affected by
the changeover. The original plans
are in line for some extensive alter-
ations. Instead of hand-hewn Appa-
lachian granite, Morgantown sand-
stone from Panther Hollow will be
used for building material. Any
marble needed will have to be
quarried from local cemeteries.

Wood trim to be used throughout
the structures will be supplied
from old, used fenceposts and tele-

Tetters to the Editor

101’s Wanted

Editor,
PittNews

Why is it that some courses such
as Statistics 101, Conimerce 101,
and, Business Law 101 are not
taught the second semester?.Un-
doubtedly, the same situation exists
in other schools, but this writer is
only familiar with the School of
Business Administration. Many
juniors and seniors were not able
to schedule these requisites when
they reported at their appointed
hour «for fall registration, because
for some reason they were com-
pletely filled at that time.

As mentioned, these courses are
requisites and a degree will not be
given without them. This is causing
some students to attend school
another full year or go to summer
‘school. It’s not always convenient,
especially veterans with families.
/It appears that these courses are
being taught on a pre-war level
instead of an accelerated program.

It has been suggested by some
students that a survey be made by
the Registrar or the Deans of the
Schools in order to find out how
many students would be benefited
by graduating a semester or two
semesters earlier if required first
semester courses are taught the
second semester. Something should
be done to eliminate this bottleneck
in our educational system.

As a Pitt alumnus, at present
writing a Ph.D. in English atvHar-
vard and also doing a little teach-
ing here, I have followed the build-
ing program in Pittsburgh, and while
my ability to make ‘financial con-
tributions is small, my interest is
great. i

I wonder, however; what propor-
tion of the fundsiraised goes ex-
clusively to building, and how much
to‘ libraries, other collections al-
ready in existence, and to the rais-

ring of faculty and staff salaries. I

approve of, and contribute to, ex-
pansion in size; but how much is
being done for continued improve-
ment in quality, surely at least
equally important?

Editor,
Pitt News

I_realize that it is a reporter’s
privilege to “color”, news as he
sees fit, and if hecan fulfill an
editorial- assignment with insuf-
ficient information, more power to
him. If,Mr. Gioia hadrdone some
research he would have found that
about the same procedure in award-
ing Panther Keys was used several
years ago. And if he canremembet
that far back, Upperclass Court
was» not in operation then. Cere-
monies to awardPanther Keys have
been used in years past. Though,
in years past reporters have been
able to write intelligently of other
matters, so that Crusades Against
Ceremonies were not used as step-
ping-stones to an editorial career.
However, if the Crusadesdo help
a future editor we feel they have
not been in vain,-.

glow of the fireplaces. The fire-
places will also supply the heat

To Men’s Council:

need for recreational space. Men’s

Council suggested the transfor-
mation of room 817 from a band re-
hearsal room to a recreational

lounge for men students.
Nobody appreciates the lack of

space in this University more than
the band. For the past three years
the band has been shoved from one
rehearsal place to another. In
1947, it was Logan Armory. Accous-
tically it was lousy, but it was a
place to rehearse. Last year it was
the basketball court in the Stadium.
This'. too left a lot to be desired.
but it was a place to ,rehearse.This
year again the band battled echoes
and basketball players to put on
good shows for the games.

Now that football season is over
and basketball season’ is in full
swing, the band needs a place to
rehearse. After all, the basketball
court was built ‘for basketball
(games and not band rehearsals.The

is sound-proofed and convenient,
even though it is a bit crowded
when you put 120 men and instru-
ments in it.

If there is a place that hasn't
been considered for band rehear-
sals, it must b in Alaska. ,

The National Guard is using

find it a bit difficult to play and
dodge half—tracks, -‘jeeps and anti-
aircraft guns at the same time.
Hunt Armory is too far away from
the campus.Neither of these places
are good rehearsal halls,» but they
were considered.

Of course the band could set up
chairs near the loading platform of
the Cathedral, but even you will
have to admit it does get a bit
chilly down there. Then there is
the cafeteria. It would be a lot of
trouble to move the ta_bles out of
the way,” but then room 817 would
make a nice game room.

Maybe Men’s Council could ar-
range for the band to use the Com-
mons Room. After all, they want to
use that austere place for dances.
Why not rehearsals, too?

Debaters Out to Equal

  

 

Last Year-’s Win Record

The Pitt Debate Team, coached by Fred S. Robie, met re-
presentatives from Seton Hill, Westminster, Carnegie» Tech and.
Geneva in a no-decision encounter last Friday night at Geneva.

College.

The debaters hope to equal the record of the 1949 team which

won the Pennsylvania state champ-
ionship and a big gold cup with an
estimated capacity of four gallons
of beer.

Coming out on top of 24 other
universities and colleges from the
state, last year's team won 12
straight matches. The Pitt negative
won the deciding debate from Mount
Mercy’s affirmative team in the
final.

In the debates at Geneva, tune-
ups for the busy season ahead, the
participants were each criticized
individually but were not compared.

Five Pitt teams were entered.
Teamed for the affirmative were
Cyril Wecht and Dick Maine, and
Ludwig Lippert and Ed Burtell.
Defending the negative were: Dick
Moskowitz and Bernie McGowan;
Tom Burkhart and Wayne. McCoy;
Larry More au and Saul Davis.

The topic for the tournament was
"Resolved: The United States
should nationalize the basic non-
agricultural industries.”

Two big tournaments are sched-
uled for Feb. 3 and 4.

Twenty schools from the Middle
Atlantic States will take part in
the annual tournament at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. A four-,man team,
hoping to equal Pitt’s second-place
finish ‘last year, will be entered.

A political hot potato, “Recog-
nizing Communist China” will be
the topic. Rebuttal will be question
and answer style.

A team of two men and two women
will travel to Bowling Green, Ohio,
to compete with about twenty Mid-
western schools in the Great Lakes

same as in the Geneva tournament.

Previous activity of Men’s De-

according to relative excellence.

It also sponsored an inter-col-

noon competition for local high

News these numbers both led to the
same man. According to the De-
partment ofMotor Vehicles in Har-
risburg, the owner was David Perl-
man of 2028 N. 3rd St. Harrisburg.
This same man was reported by the
BBB as being the owner of two
other cars whose license numbers
were caught.

According to the Bureau, however,
the license numbers which lead to
Perlman do not brand him as the
sole operator. At least four other
different plate numbers have been
reported. The Bureau has now
turned the matter over to Pittsburgh
police to work on.

At least one of the vehicles used
in the racket has been identified
as a shabby delivery truck. Another
was a new Chevrolet club coupe.

PAUL DIETZ V
Chessboard Champ

Junior Gets

Chess Title

A Pitt junior has won national

honor as the top collegiate chess“

player in the United States.

On December "30, Paul Dietz,
College ’51,won the National Inter-
collegiate Chess Championship in
competition with 40 other conten-
ders from colleges all over the
country. He played to six wins and
a draw, his nearest competitor get-
ting five wins, one loss, and one
draw.

The matches at Rutgers Univer-

were not the first won by Dietz. He
holds a long list of titles. In 1946

and 1947 he took the Western Penn-

sylvania Scholastic Chess League
Championship and the Rapid Tran-
sit Chess Championship.

He won both the Junior and Sen-
ior State championships and the
YMCA championship in 1948. In
1949 he again won the junior State
Championship and was runner-up in
the Senior State matches.

His last victory was, of course,
his crowning achievement. But he
says, "I would have gotten more of
a thrill.out of winning if I felt that
I were the best player there.” _He
gives credit to runner-up Elliot
Hearst of Columbia‘University as
the top player in the tournament.

' Try-outs are open to anyone over
14 years of age. Singers, dancers,

ductor of the auditions for Mr. Heidt.
Mr. Rankin suggests that no groups
larger than a quartet try out.

Application for auditions con-
sists only of appearing at Station
WJAS, since no formal application
is required. It is suggested that
applicants bring their own accom-
panists to give them familiar sur-
roundings in which to work. ’

Successful performers will appear
on Hcxace Heidt’s show at The
Gardens on Jan. 26 with his two

those who give outstanding perform-
ances will appear on a future net-
work broadcast.

Heidt’s country wide talent hunt
has been successful in starting
many young amateurs on the road
to stardom, and performance with
his 1950 Variety Revue at The Gar-

Frats Cope
With Bias

By LARRY HERLICK

Recent developments have some-
what relieved the discrimination
record of men’s fraternities. A new
fraternity has been organized at
Pitt on a non-sectarian basis, and
one of the established frats has
changed its national constitution
thus putting it on a non»-sectarian
basis.

Most important of these is the
rapid growth of Kappa Beta Phi.
Organized by a group of nine men
of Catholic, Protestant, and Jew-

ish faiths just a year ago, Kappa .

Beta Phi now has 25 actives and
three alumni. The feature disting-
uishing this frat from others at
Pitt is the fact that it is on a non-
discriminatory basis in practice.
Until it is recognized by the Pitt
Fraternity Committee, however,
Kappa Beta Phi will not be recog-
nized as a bona fide University
organization. This committee is
slated to review the fraternity on

Thursday to determine its quali-
fications. ~

According to Lester Brailey,
advisor to fraternities, the most

important consideration given to
the question of admitting another
fraternity to the campus is the
place that it can take in the stu-
dent body. That is, is there room
for it?

Members of the Fraternity Com-
mittee are Dean of Men T.W. Biddle,
Mr. Brailey, Dr. Arthur M. Young,
Dr. Theodore R. Parker, Dr. Karl
H. Oermann, Dr. William F. Swan-
son, Dr. Paul L. McLain, Dr. Ste-
phen Wilson,. and Prof. Robert D.
Ayars.

Dave Diette

Iowa-to-Navy-to-Pitt

By DAVE POLLOCK

It took a 69-0 lacing by Mich-
igan in 1947,“ the worst in Pitt's
football history, for Dave Dietterich
to realize that there was a Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Two years later

he entered Skyscraper U. on a
basketball scholarship.
Dietterich’s basketball ability

was discovered by a friend of Tom
Hamilton while the _young heopster
was burning up the  Navy’s
hardwood.

And when Hamilton came from
Annapolis to Pitt as athletic direc-
tor, he arranged for a basketball
scholarship for Dave.

But for some reason, Dietterich
was asked to switch his scholar-
ship to football. He did this and
played second string end on the
freshman team the past season.

Asked if he would like to play
basketball here at P.itt, Dave re-
plied, "Do I have to answer that?”
Then he went on to say, "I don't
think I would make out so good
here. It’s not my kind of a system.”

The six foot, 180 pounder works
in the check room, and this, too,
has kept him from trying out for
basketball.

Eight Letter Man _

While attending high school in

Clinton, Iowa, Dietterich earned
eight letters in sports.‘
Dave's senior year found him

pacing the basketball team toi20
victories in 24 games. He dumped

in 378 points and received mention
on the all-state team.

Besides his basketball, the sandy
haired youngster played end on the
football team and was a one-man
track squa’d.He participated in four
events, the 440, high jump, pole
vault, and broad jump.

Paced the Fleet

When he graduated from high
school, Dave entered the Navy and
he recalls that he spent exactly
four years, seven months, and‘2l
days under Uncle Sam.

It didn’t take long for the Navy
to find out that Dietterich knew
what to do_with a basketball. He
was a leading scorer at Treasure
Island, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and
New London, Conn.

Only last season Dave and the
Norfolk Amphibs lost the All-Navy
championship by three points.

Kedemus a Teammate

“A lot 'of boys- who played on
my Navy teams were college ball
players, or have since gone to
college,” says Dieterich. "I only
remember one by name, Jeff Ked-
emus from Villanova.”

Dave is confining his basketball
playing to the YMCA t-eam this year
in the intramural league. His team-
mates all agree that he is a good
man with a basketball

In the Y's only game this year,
Dave Dietterich was the leading
scorer.

School Officials
Attend Bowls

Four Pitt officials attended post-
season football contests prior to
the resumption of classes last week.

Head Football Coach Mike Milli-
gan took in the Rose Bowl at Pasa-
dena, Cal.; Graduate Manager of
Athletics Frank Carver, the Sugar
Bowl at New Orleans, La.; Assis-
tant Dean of Men Richard Cassiano,
the Orange Bowl at Miami, Fla.;
and Dr. Ralph Shanor, grid team
physician, also the Orange Bowl.

Cassiano and Shanor arrived
early and watched Panther Lou
"Bimbo” Cecconi play in Miami’s
North—South Shrine game. '

Carnegie Tech Here Tomorrow

ble

Surprising Tartans Have
Good Chance to Beat Pitt

By WILL DOERGE '

Carnegie Tech has its best chance in many a season this year
to spring a victory over a Pitt basketball team. A

The battle-weary Panthers, attempting to bounce back from
their defeat by Cincinnati on Saturday,63-38, take on the Tartans

tomorrownight at the Stadium.

Not since 1941 when Tech upended Doc Carlson’s five, 56-46,
..has the Plaid wona game from the Panthers. _In the all-time series
between the two schools that dates back to 1905, Pitt holds a lop-

sided 68-12 lead in games.

Dog's Day’
The varsity clash is scheduled for 8:15 pm. preceded by a
freshmen game between Bobby Artmarr’s Pitt squad and the Tech

fro sh at 6:45.

If it's true that every dog has
its day, then Tech’s day should be
due tomorrow. The Tartans have
shown good form in several games
to date and should give Pitt quite
a tussle.

Coach Mel Cratsley’s five sur-
prised by upsetting Lawrence Tech,
a midwestern power, 66-53, and
gave the scrappy Bethan quintet

. a good going over, 72- 0. Their

record for the season is five won,
three lost. Pitt has won one and
lost four.

All Vets

Tech has a veteran player at
every position, and they all have
height. Sparking the Tartans*has
been Guard Jack Riehl, (6-0) the
leading Plaid scorer.

The always dangerous Mike Theo-
dore (6-2) is still around at center.
He was the leading Tech scorer
last season, but hasn't lived up
to his past performances so far
this Year. '

Len Bianchi (6-1), a regular from
the 1947-48 squad, and Freshman

- Tom Craig (6-2), only newcomer to

‘the Tartans, are the starting for-
wards, while the other guard is
Tommy Beck, a classy sophomore.

Experienced players backing up
the first line men are Joe Matsey
(66), Bob McCullugh- (6-1), and
Connie Hammann (6-3).

Center Jammed

As usual, then, Pitt's Panthers
will be dwarfed.And if Tech should
take a cue from Westminster and
effectively block the center, thwart-
ing the Panther’s continuity game,
the Tartans may be a winner again
after nine years.

Last Saturday, Pitt was no match

Perhaps it will be added
weight, but you can't blame the
Pitt swimming team if they start
wearing good luck charms.

Their season has just started,
but already they have had more than
their share of ill luck. Even so,
the natators were able to win their
initial meet, 40-26, defeating Kent
State, at Revenna, Ohio last Satur-
day. ,

It wasn't bad enough that Trees

to give his team the proper workout.

getter with ten, winning easily in
the 220-yard and 440-yard free
style.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the young season was the defeat of
Dick Petro in the 100-yard free
style. He was beaten by a sopho-
more teammate, Jules Melograne.
Petro did, however, finish first in
the 50-yard free style.

Westminster Next

Other Pitt firsts were Al Baran
in the backstroke, and Bob Gover
in the breaststroke. The Panthers
had a total of six firsts, three sec-
onds, and five thirds for their 40-
point total.

Good luck charms or not, the
Panthers will leave for New Wil-
mington tomorrow for their second
meet of the season.They will swim

Intramtirals
Back in Gym

Intramural basketball was wel-
comed back to seedy but safe Trees
gym last night with a nod from en
gineérs that the building was not‘
seriously damaged bya stray stream V
of cement. .

Teams in the IM loops are pro-
ceeding according to the same.
schedules that were drafted at the'
opening of'the season more than.
a month ago.

All games played previous to the
December halting of competition
will be considered official league
contests. On the other hand, all’
games by-passed during the dormant
period will be handled as post
poned affairs.

One of the big factors which en-
abled IM Director Leo C. Bemis to i
go through with full schedules was .
the acquisition of Logan Armory.

Cleaning out desk drawers his a preoccupation which usually

ever, you are so unfortunate as to possess a desk in a newspaper

DOC CAIRLSON:
Out of a desk drawer

prised when I find in my desk a
~- pair of gym shoes, a textbook in
‘etymology (which I am not study-
ing, not intend to study), a salt
shaker, or a jar of mustard. But
when I discover a blank examina-
tion form from a course in basket-
ball_coaching given by Dr. Harold

Carlson, my curiosity can’t help
but be aroused.
Larceny?

.Apparently one of the sports
reporters, up in Good Harold’s

office for‘an interview, spotted the
list of ‘test questions and deftly
‘put the snatch on it when the Doc-
~tor wasn't looking. You can never
. tell wlien a list of test questions
will come in handy, you know.
Whatever the means by which
the paper got here, it might be
recreational to take a crack at the
answers. Students taking the course
can copy at their own risk.

~.-~ Q. Name the three objectives of

A. 1. Character building, of course

Q. What is the order of emphasis

coaching and teaching.

2. Imparting skill and knowledge
3. Picking up a pay check

on the three objectives of coach-
ing in the first, second, and last
weeks of the season?

A. Skill and knowledge first,
character building second, picking
up the pay check as often as pos-
sible. "

Shooting.)

Q. Name the two types of shooting
and give five different kinds of
each.
A. One-handed shots:

1. Push shot

2. Hook shot

3. Underhand lay-up shot

4. One-handed tip-in shot

5. Brass rail shot

Two-handed shots:

1. Chest set shot

2. Overhead set shot _

3. Underhand shot from deeipdown

4. Pivot-twist shot in ‘mid-air

5. Shot in the dark for answering

tests like this one

Q. Enumerate ten skills or funda-
mentals, offensive or defensive,
which you think should be taught
at all times. 1

8. Faking

10. Sneaking a second bar of" ice

There were other questionsin the
examination which will not be
treated here, for they were a bit
too technical to be of interest to
the lay sports fan. (That’s a good
out for not knowing the answers.)

BEING RE'I‘OUCl!ED-When the University's build-
ing program was announced more than a year ago,
architects pictured the future field house like the
fabove. But construction on the athletic plant was
stopped last summer and the plans are being revised.

  

Nevertheless, the outer appearance is not expected to
be changed. Inside, the seating capacity will be en-
larged, and facilities will be set up to handle addi-
tional sports. The exact date when construction will
be resumed is anybody’s guess. See story Page 1.

  
 

‘ SPORTS FRAT MEETS

There will be a meeting of Sig-
ma Delta Psi athletic fraternity
tomorrow in the Trees gym of-
ice at 4:30.

More Delay
On Grid Pact

Another delay in signing of Head
Football Coach Mike Milligan to a
new contract came up this week.

Athletic Director ‘Tom Hamilton,
whose presence will probably be
required before any action can take
place, has gone to New York City
and will not return until next Tues-
day. He will speak Monday night
in Williamsport, Pa., at a dinner
in honor of Panther Fullback Carl
DePasqua.

Pitt’s Athletic Committee met
last Thursday evening and shaped
up an offer to present to Milligan,
but thus far no action has been re-
vealed, giving the backfence gos-
sipers plenty of food for specula-
tion. ‘ .

The Committee's meeting was
preceded by procrastination when
Chairman Dr. Homer Oschenhirt
announced in early December that‘
his group would meet “before Christ-
mas,” but no gathering material-
ized.

Hard to Crack

The inexperienced Panthers, who
traveled 1
of winning after losing a close
match to Indiana Teachers, 16-12,
found the Buckeyes hard nuts to
crack. Composed of four lettermen
and four sophomores, the Ohio State
team racked up four decisions, two
falls, and a draw to win their open-
ing meet of the season. -
The Bucks got off to a fast start
when Bill Weber, a 121-pound letter-
man, won over Dan Richards, 7-0.
In a close match, Ray Cappelli,
Pitt's 128-pounder, was edged by
George Molodet, 3-2.

A Pitt Officials Association.
Since 1947, his first year on the
the .job, Bemis has hoped for a_

officials. He now Seems to have
the ball rolling inhigh gear.

Not only do his hardies have
first call on all preliminary games
at the Stadium, but they are obtain-
ing working agreements withleagues
outside the campus, too. In the
meantime, of course, they continue
to play papa to their favorite baby,
intramural basketball.

"This marks our arrival into
big-time officiating,” Bemis smiles.
“A strong group of officials means
better competition among the teams,
and .since the advent of the POA
] we have been getting better played

Thus far this season the colleg-
‘iate whistle-tooters have handled

Ohio State’s first fall came in
the 153-pound encounter when Cap-
tain Milt Klein pinned Pirt’s Morris

Conklin Wins Again

Pitt’s captain, Doc Conklin,temp-

fruitful efforts of adding to their
point-total by pinning Fred McLean,
in the 165-pound fray.

Conklin caught McLean with a
half-Nelson and crotch late in the

victory of the season and tally five‘

Haven Teachers at the Stadium

Lock Haven’s experienced team invades the pavilion to give
the Panthers a doubtful opportunity to pin their first victory of the
season. "In their only other Stadium appearance thus far, Coach
Rex Peery’s grapplers lost the opener to Gettysburg, 20-6 before

man, was credited with OSU’s second
fall. He pinned Bill Johnson with a
cradle hold in 42 seconds of the
third period.

The Panthers scored two points
in the Heavyweight clash when
John Masarik drew with Tom Wilson
OSU’s roundman. Wilson outweighed
Pitt’s entrant by some 45 pounds.

Conklin Mat
Point Leader

With the first of the ‘year gone
by the boards, people engaged in

various activities, athletic and
otherwise, are taking inventory
of stock.

As a team, the Panthers, who
started from scratch, are doing no
worse than was expected of them.
To date, they have lost three
meets and won none. However, in
the process they have acquired a
lot of experience ‘that should pay
dividends as the year progresses.
The team has scored a total of
25 points against their opponents’
60 in three encounters. Foremost
among the point-makers is Doc
Conklin, a medical student. Conk-
lin,who is undefeated, has 11 meet
points to his credit.

Doc has operated successfully
three times. His last operation, a
fall over OSU’s Fred McLean, was
a full count success.

To Answer

MC Letter  

In answer to Men's Council’s pre-
vacation letter asking for permis-
sion to turn room 817 Cl.into a men
student's lounge, Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald has announced that
out-of-town business will prevent
him from giving the request any im-
mediate consideration. ’

Upon his return, the Chancellor
told Roy Nelson, head of the com-
mittee that drew up the letter, he
will consider the matter and make
a reply..

“The need for additional recrea-
tion space” prompted Council to
write the letter in the first place.
\According_ to Nelson, the eighth

floor room would be an “ideal
location.”
Included in the letter was the

statement that the number of card
players who take advantage of the
scattered tables on the men's floor
warrant a permanent lounge.

Howard Greenberger, president
of Men’s Council, envisions the
proposed lounge _as containing a
television set, ‘*"ping pong tab es,
and other recreational facilities.

"Men's Council is endeavouring
to provide facilities for men stu-
dents so they will have a larger

extra-curricular program,’ ’ Green-
berger added.
According to Nelson, Council

does not believe that the transfer-
ring of music appreciation classes
andvof the band rehearsals would be
too difficult to accomplish.

DR. JULIUS ROGOFF

Pre-Med Frat
Initiates 21  

Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary
pre-med fraternity‘, will initiate 21
new members on Jan. 12 in Stephen
Foster Memorial Hall.

Dr. Maurice L. Moore, national
secretary of the frat will be the
frat will be the main speaker of the
evening. His topic will be "Some.
Present Problems in Pre-medical
Education.”

Dr. Moore, who is also a member
of the executive Committee of the
Association of College Honorary
Societies, was recently appointed
Director of Research at the Smith,
Kline, and French Research Labor-
atories in Philadelphia.

' Alpha Epsilon Delta, which now

has 65 actives, appeared on the
Pitt Campus in February of 1948
when the local pre-med honorary,

will probably release the essen-
tials of the plan for publication.”

Discovered Drug

The Rogoff Foundation was es-
tablished for the "promotion of
medical research and teaching."
It is supported by funds from the
patent on’ the doctor’s isolation of
the adrenalin gland hormone, which
is used for the cure of Addison's
Disease.

The doctor regards arguments for
socialized medicine as "merely a
demand for change” due to serious
faults in the present system of
medical practice. Over-specializa-
tion, “slot-machine” medicine, and
the use of new drugs without ade-
quate research are some of the
faults he pointed out.

Visited Israel
Dr. Rogoff recently returned from
a three-month tour of Israel where
he studied existing health condi-
tions. Israel's main health prob-

and psychia-tric disorders among
the many immigrants. The prelim-
inaries of his plan were received
with much interest there.

The Pitt gland specialist gave
the first series of lectures to the
opening class of the first Jewish
medical school in the world, the
Hebrew University Hadassah Med-
ical School.’

"As an oasis of democracy in
the Near East, Israel would prove
valuable as a pioneer spot for -a.
well-planned medical education
system,” said the doctor.
