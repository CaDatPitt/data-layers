A lack of publicity has been
blamed for the current failure of
the YMCA- membership drive, says
Frederick J. Miller, secretary of
the YMCA.

By the end of a month of re-

seventy new members.

The Y has had newspaper and
poster advertising in addition to
the Word of mouth publicity by
the present members.

Each Y member received ap-
plication cards to give to inter-
ested friends. The student desk
on the ground ﬂoor also received
application cards for those who
applied there for membership.

Scholar's Day

Response To University

»X-Ray Program Disappointing

Out of Pitt’s student enrollment of 25,000 students and 458 faculty

members, only 5,470 students and faculty took advantage of the

free chest x—rays.

The x—rays were given every day from 9:30 a. m. to, 4:30 p. m.

from November 3 to November 15.

Thissmeant seven houfs every day.

On the average of four x—rays a minute, 1,680 x—rays could have
been given in one day—16,800 in the ten days the portable unit

was here. Yet, only one sixth ofe

Pitt student body and faculty were
x—rayed. '

The ﬁrst day which was consid-
ered the best had a total of 823 x-
rays. Even this meant a loss of
approximately three hours of x-
ray time. The _ second _day was
723. Sin-ce then the rate‘fell stead-
ily leaving the last day with only
262 x—rays given. This last week
the unit even opened an hour ear-
lier in hopes of reaching‘ -more
students.

The technicians were amazed at
the lack of response shown here.
They found Pitt the least receptive
of any place they had taken their
unit. They said, “In comparison
with the other places that we have
been where the people weren’t as
well educated—-even to the point
of not being able to speak English

Rally Set for Friday

Frid«ay’s bon—ﬁre rally at Ellsworth C:.lllL¥l‘ has more student back-
ing‘ than any other affair that has blotched the social calendar this
semester. Student Congress, Pan-Hel, IF, and the Independent faction
have the Administration’s blessings in their “Stew State” rally.

Lighting the torch at the corner of Bigelow Blvd. and Tennyson
Ave., the victory-crazed mob will fall in behind the marching band
as it rounds the corner on it's way from Logan armory.

The torch-light . parade
wend through Oakland to Shady-
side and to the Ellsworth ﬁeld
where the wood-ﬁlching_ efforts of
Bob Ingram will be burned. Bob
brags, “We have enough wood.
that, laid end to end, would reach
to Penn State and back.”

The gathering at Ellsworth is
strictly a rally. The Panther,
cheerleaders, and the coaching
staff will provoke yells and ad-
monitions from the crowd. (lu-
cidentally. there will be no Bob
Prince at the rally.)

The “Stew State" enthusiasts
will fan out to fraternity houses
and to the Ellsworth cafeteria
after the mass meeting for danc-

.ing and eating. Congress has sup-
plied the center crowd with a

Dance Concludes
State Weekend

Pitt, students‘ are planning to
bury the hatchet with Penn Stat-
ers. Alumni, and anyone else that
comes to the “Hatchet Hop” after
the Penn State game.

The “Hatchet Hop,” which will
be held at the Syria,l\/Iosque, Will
feature the music of Bill Leroy.
It will climax a football week-end
consisting of the pep rally Friday
e\'ening,,the game Saturday aft-
ernoon, and the “Hatchet Hop”
after the game.

Tickets are 50 c ‘ts and will be
sold at the Stude Activity desk
and at the Mosque the day of the
dance. I

¢ At the same time, fra-ternities
and sororities are having open‘

house for independents.

High on the list of objectives is
to have more and a larger variety
of social affairs for independents.

One'of.the ﬁrst things planned
by the Independents is to request
a clariﬁcation of the Tuck Shop
system of, fraternity controlled
booths. _V - _

During the noon hour, say the
Independents, the Tuck Shop is,

so crowded by loiterers, and the/ f

chairs and booths are so cluttered
with personal possessions that
some students cannot eat their
lunch there.

A request for clariﬁcation of‘ C '

certain actions of Student Con-r

 

gress will also be made in the-» -I

near future.

The Independents are looking
forward to a rapidgrowth. All
non-fraternity and non-sorority
women can join by attending eith-
er of the two regular Friday meet-
ings at 12:30 p. m. in mm 324
and at 1:30 p. m.‘ in room G 24.

According to Stu Workmaster,
girls of the School of Nursing, the
‘E & M Cabinet, and the Chem
Specials pledged their support to
the Independents.

John Rosanski, whose speech on
school spirit was recently publish-
ed in The News, and Chuck Davis, A
are two of the more prominent.

students who are in favor of the_

an°In:depen-dent organization.
The organization has already re-

ceived san-ction from the offices-

of the Dean of Men and Dean of
Women.

A committee of volunteers head-
ed by Harry Pluebell, acting chair-
man, will meet on Tuesday, Nov.
18, to appoint a temporary steer-
ing committee. _

It has already been suggested
that a button of identification be
designed for members of the In-
dependents.

Conﬁdent in the part that the ‘

Independents will play in student
activities, Eugene Caplan, a mem.
ber, predicts, “The next election
will show a sweeping majority of
Independents in all of the govern.
ing activities in _iPtt.”

An amusement tax Which would cost Pitt
. students thousands of dollars yearly is being
considered by City Council. The proposed
levy, a city tax of 10% on all events for
which admission is charged, would increase the
total amusement assessment to a new high of

charge. ,
This discriminatory tax would up the cost

of all school functions. The groups hit; by the

measure would include Cap and Gown, Pitt

other organizations charging admission for
any type of aﬂair, social or otherwise. Athletics,
of course,'*wi1l also come under the ruling.
The students hit hardest by the prospective
tax hike will be the veterans. They are least
able to pay higher rates for the few luxuries
they can afford. Most of them ﬁnd it difficult
enough-to eat and sleep on $65 a month, and
for those with families to support, the pro-
posed measure may mean drastic curtailment
of ‘pleasures like movies, sports events, con-

certs and many others.
,d= =I= =l=

_ There will be an open hearing on the matter
at city hall on ‘Wed, Nov. 19, at 2 p. m., at
which all interested may register their pro-
tests. Letters to the mayor and to the council-
men will ,.also be eﬂfective. . .

VVe oppose this new tax fully.,The city of
Pittsburghhas chosen to discriminate against
a single industry in its efforts to raise new
revenue, and the burden will fall upon those
least able to bear it. If council approves,
Pittsburgh will have the highest amusement tax
in the country. ' '

It is up to the student body to see that City
Council hears their protests. Show up at the
hearing Wednesdhy. If you can ’t do that, phone
or write the mayor and the councilmen. Let
the city fathers know that they can’t pass
such a measure with clear consciences.

‘Stew v State’

Friday night is rally night at Pitt. It’s the
-ﬁrst big bonﬁre whoop-te-do since you know
when.

The sponsors of theaﬁair, Student Con-
gress, Pan-Hellenic Council and IF Council,
have made plans that should make it a big
evening for everyone, and that’s who should
be there—everyone.

Music by the Pitt band, parades, speeches,
cheers, songs, bonﬁre, free dancing at Frat

‘ and Sorority houses-—it’s all there. All it needs
is YOU. Come alone, come in couples, come in
groups——but come. You’ll have the time of
your college life. »

We warmed up for this one before the Ohio
State game, but this event is an institution
returned; le't’s welcome it with open arms and
go on from there. Here ’s the way it lines up:

VVe light the ﬁre Friday night with a torch-

‘ light parade from the Cathedral to-Ellsworth
Center, fan it at the rally, let it simmer over

‘night, and Saturday-—-we STEW STATE.

Editor, Pitt News:

The “Few and itgliei'l\Iany:«i..i . .
Instructor Berates
Chest Drive Policy

I

America is known as a country of dissenters. It was founded

by dissenters. Sometimes, it still permits dissent. I am glad the

University of Pittsburgh, and especially the PITT NEWS, re-

calls with veneration that ‘timeless comment of Voltaire:l".‘I‘

do not agree with a word of what you say, but I will defend

to the death your right to say

it.’ ’

I am a dissenter on a current issue: the Community Chest

drive. I oppose the basic princi-9

ple of the drive:‘Urging people to
pay on an equalibasis-—the needy
along with the aﬁ‘luent—for the re-
sults of economic inequality. The
appeal at the University has been:
“Each one pay $2.00.”

But our present phase of free en-
terprise encourages concentration
of wealth in a few hands at the
expense of the majority (see the
U. S. House» of Represenetatives
Report on Small Business which
warns of the increasing menace of
big business monopolies in Ameri-
ca“—a report, incidentally, which
was killed in 98 percent of" the
“free” press).

With our present society, then,
being undermined by subversive
industrial elements (an inﬁltra-
tion neeatly passed off on “commu-
nists” and “reds”) there are grave
inequalities. It is only logical that
where need arises from these, those
most responsible for the inequali-
ties should foot the bill.

What group is responsible for

the deﬁciencies and lacks which

the. Community Chest drive seeks
to alleviate? Here are the ﬁgures
of the U. S. Federal Reserve
Board: liout of 5 families in the
U. S. has an income of less than

«$1,000 a year. Could yourlfamily

live on that? Who has the money,
then? Labor? The U. S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics reveals that
the average wage in the manufac-
turing industry is $45 a week;
and the Heller~ Committee Bud-
getary Report proves that it takes
a minimum of $68.77 for a family
of four to live on a bar subsis
tence level. . l .

What about the gap? The 18th

Quarterly Report of OPA in 1946’
stated: “If prices had been raised ,

only on the basis of increased-labor
costs, they would have gone up .6
percent. However, prices have gone
up 5.9 percent.” “In other words,”
says another survey, “industry
took back $10 for every $1 paid
out in wages.” And today, in 1947,
that process continues—acceler-
ated. '

.Bes'l- Able Should Fill Needs

Why are food prices high? The proﬁts of ‘ a big national dairy

for the ﬁrst six months of_ 1946

were $11,803,000-—an increase of

69% over the previous year; another dairy showed an increase of

51%, another of 79%. On,1946, the

“Big Six” meat packershad niade

$38,700,000 a year over the past four years, a 200% in-crease ‘over

the pre-war average. Have wages
the answer.

kept pace with this? You know

Let those best able to take care:

of the needs which they themselves
have created, take care of them.
Should the average G. 1. student
at the University be asked to foot

the bill? He can barely survive on
$65 a month. Should the married
veteran, on $90 a month, be asked
to support the destitute?, He_'can-
not support himself, and he has
already paid-—in' years and blood
and sweat. ~

It has a lovely ring: “Let each
of us give $2.00.” But the reali-
ties of our society are not geared
to platitudinous levellipg. Demo-
cratic taxation has always meant:
from each according to his means.

a sales tax on the whole public:
those least able to pay are most
affected: Another 2 cents on an

article hits a $50-a-week worker
pretty hard over a period of time;
but the millionaire, who pays the
same, scarcely feels it. I believe
in protesting out methods of big
time charity until the corporations,
by one means or another, shoulder
the burden. ‘ I

A few days ago, when I ﬁrst de-
cided to express my views on
this subject, I was dissuaded from
it. Then, one morning, I happened
to sit down with one‘ of the long-
established, venerable professors at
the University. We were both say-
ing that we did no-t like in the
least the hold-up method of col-
lectingw funds—--having our classes
interrupted for high-pressure
salesmanship.

Prof Puts Blame one |ndusl'rialis'I's

Then, without my soliciting it, he put the blame on the very
ones I had had in mind. “There are other better able to pay,” I said. He
nodded his head" grimly. “The industrialists,” he remarked, with

inﬁnite implication .

. and a moment later he got up to leave,

and said, “If it were a moral question, I would ﬁght it.”
This gentleman, whom I admire greatly, belongs to the old
school in many ways, I presume; he certainly is not what one would

think of as a radical. Yet if he¢

can see through the pall of mis-
informtaion which wreaths our
press and radio, the least I can
do is say _what both of us feel.
And I know there are many vet-
erans who feel the same way.
They are being asked to redeem.
in dollars, the sins of a system
they believed they were glorify-
ing.‘

“If it were a moral question 'I_
would light it.”

Many of us do believe it is a
moral question. Years ago, Thomas
Jefferson, whose wisdom is just
as true "in any year for any Ameri-
can, wrote these words:

“I am conscious that an equal
division of property is impracti-

 

enormous . inequality producing so
much misery to the bulk of man-
kind, legislators cannot invent too
many devices fa.‘ subdividing pro-
perty . . . another means of si-
lently ‘lessening the inequality of
property is to exempt all from tax-
ation below a certain. point, and
to the higher portions of property
in geometrical progression as they
rise . . . .

“The general spread of the light
of science has already laid open to
every view the palpable truth, that
the mass of mankind has not been
bornwith saddles on their backs,
nor a few favored few, booted and
spurred, ready to ride them legiti-
mately, by the Grace of God . . .”

Ho: ‘Willie's’ About
Stadium and Panthers

  

--———by Bill a Veenis""""""""-"'
This week, for a change, Pitt plays a game of
football at the stadium. Coming right out wtih it,
Pitt plays the Nittany Lions from Penn State.
After last Saturday Penn State’s 20-7 dump of
Navy -and Pitt's 23-0 defeat at the hands or the
Boilermakers--the odds are pretty much in favor

J

M of the boys from'Nittany. They should win.

There‘ are numbers of people a'round',here and
up at State College, Pa., who have doubts about
-the “sure”, outcome of the _. game. Reasons for this
insecure feeling are many. A comparison of. the .
schedules of both, ‘schools would make anyonetake
notice. Penn State has 7 met few, if‘ any, teams
that would stand up on Pitt’s present schedule. 4

And, then, there is the ‘stadiuinjinx. Our bonded
indebtedness on the hill has proved a real sore
spot for some of State's best. teams. It may this
year. ‘ 1 ‘ p 1

Another angle of this football-classic, overlooked
by many football swamis, is the strain on the "spot"
for some of , State's best Nittany Lions when‘ tliey
hit Pittsburgh. A’ close look at the State roster ﬁnds
no less than 31 players, hailing from the iron and V,
steel area of Western Pennsylvania. some of their ‘ 
brightest stars began ‘the famous institution of _

, football right here in thecity.
There’s pressure galore when a boy comes home A-

to‘ play -before the home crowd. When Mom and
Pop, near and far relatives, and the high school
buddies are in the stands, no one can deny that
Joe Doaks is under pressure to make good. In most
cases, he’s plen-ty tight. Examples‘. of fumbling home
heroes turned goats ﬁll the football record book.

State will be tight this weekend. The 31, out
of 53 squad members? have a show "to put on.
Mom and Pop will be watching. The Panthers will
be watching, too.

. ~ Loosening their vocal cords for the great awakening, Pitt’s
‘ ‘choral groups are makingthe thirty-first ﬂoor reverberate with an
* ever. increasing volume of rhythm and melody‘. I

Now that Indian Summer is over and hints of winter weather
are obvious, enthusiastic student singers are determined to re-vitalize
the music life of ‘the University. . ‘

The Heinz Chapel Choir, the Wome'n’s Chorus, the Men’s Glee
(Club, and the Pitt singers are
constantly‘ practicing for a new
season that promises them a long
list of varied performances.

Directed by David G.‘Weis-s, the
three groups vocalize chieﬂy in
secular songs. The Men’s Glee
Club carries a repertory of ener-
gized, ro-bust arias that include
“Song of Wonderlust,” “Brothers
Sing On,”'and “Stout Hearted
Men.” Romance and love are char-
acterized in the music produced
by the Women’s chorus.

From these choral units stem a
variety of speciality qu-artets, trios,
and soloists who sing in many
musical functions of the Univer-
sity. One of" the variations of the
Men’s Glee Club . is the Merry
Gentlemen Quartet. It delineates
folk songs and semi-classical re-
frains in combined or spot pre-
sentations. Norman Rose, ﬁrst
tenor; Allen Marks, second tenor;
Richard Cobb, baritone; and Frank
Kodman, bass, make up the combo-.
S Ha-ndlinggthe swing and comedy
routines are the Hemidemisemi-
quavers '(“on_e-sixteenth noters”).
This quartet is used primarily in
spot performances. It consists of
Carl Burk, ﬂrst tenor; Fred Has-
sett, second tenor; Milton Cohen,
baritone; and Frank Kodman, bass.

Unlike the other choral organi-
zations, the Heinz Chapel Choir
features a repertoire of religious
compositions, Under the. directions

PiH Drops Fifth Big 1

Nine Game

Pitt's Panthers owe‘ reserve
backs John Ulam and Bill Bruno
a small vote of thanks for pre-
venting Purdue from registering a
complete annihilation last Satur-
day.

Ulam and Bruno chalked up
Pitt’s only pair of ﬁrst downs
while the Boilermakers were roll-
ing for 18, and a 28-0 victory.

This game marked the close of
1947. invasions of the midwest by
the Pittsburgh team and the ﬁfth
straight on-the—road loss to Big
Nine elevens.

Black clouds hovering over the
soggy turf of Ross-Ade Stadium
kept the Homecoming Day crowd
down to 19,000 damp spectators.

Rather than viewing an aerial
duel between Boilermaker quar-
terback Bob DeMoss and Pitt’s
Paul Rickards, the Wheeling
Whip, the fans watched Purdue's-
mammoth line rip apart the Pan-
ther forward wall for Halfbacks
Harry Szulborski and Norbert

‘ Adams to. scamper through and

away.
Again Pitt failed to generate
even a semblance of an offense,

~ gaining a pathetic total of 33 yards

on the ground and 17 yards on a
solitary pass completion. ‘
Jimmy Joe Robinson had the

. questionable distinction of mark-

ing up the longest ground gain of
the day for the Panthers, ten
yards.

Coach Mike Milligan threw
every back on the traveling squad
into the fray, even newcomers Joe
Cherol and Fred Botti, but to no
avail. Purdue's giant linemen just
poured in too fast and too often.

Bill (Joe Toe) Hardisty offered
theionly conselation as he contin-
ued his terriﬁc kicking, averaging
32.1 yards a boot.

Hig's ‘Poor Little Lambs‘ Set

For Annual Shearing By Piﬂ

By Max Scherb
The golden leaves h-ave all but disappeared from the trees. People
hurry home in the early dusk. And out of the mountains around State
College, Bob Higgins is bringing his ﬂock down to the -big city for

their annual shearing.

From the tables down at Mory’s to Glazer’s Gold Bar, the wise
boys are in complete agreement. Regardless of how well the Lions have
been performing before coming to Pittsburgh, the outcome is usually
the same. An-other almost perfect season spoiled for Penn State.

State’s own alumni are aware of this. “We just can’t beat Pitt
in Pittsburgh,” is their universal opinion. The 1947 Nittanymen will
boast of one of the best intercollegiate records in the nation but‘

Eagles Lose
By Bancl. I8-O

Pulling the biggest upset of the
year in the Independent loop, the
Band crushed the Eagles, 18-0,
and removed the Birds from the
tight league title race.

In the first quarter Burt Logan,
Band back, took an Eagle punt
and raced 60 yards for the initial
Music-maker tally.

This would have been a wide‘

enough margin for a major sur-
prise, but the Bandmen weren’t
satisﬁed as they rolled on to two
more scores in the second half.

lM Style Plan
Set for Frosh

A program of competition
among teams chosen from candi-
dates for the Panther frosh ﬂoor
team will be carried out in place
of a regular schedule.

Different practice schedules for

provide each with ample oppor-
tunity to display his ability to

Niffany Lions Might As
wen Face H; They Jusf .
Can'f Bean fhe Panfhers

By John Golighfly

They have been roaring down from Mt. Nittany since 1893. They
always have a good team. They capture headlines by mopping-up
the likes of Washington State, Bucknell, Fordham, Syracuse, West
Virginia, Colgate, Temple, and Navy. — _

The bonﬁres burn bright every Saturday night at State‘ Col-

lege where the Nittany Lions celebrate their victories. With the r

Panthers it’s a different story. The Big Nine elevens defeat Pitt
withregularity. Nationally, Pitt is near the bottom in offense and

defense.

Penn State is seven bonﬁres ahead of us this season. But they’re
not stacking ﬁrewood up at State College. Tomorrow afternoon

they’ll begin tightening up like they do every November.
It’s been the same for 47 meetings and it’s inexplicable.

matter how good they are and n09”

PiKA End Play

matter how poorly we perform,
a victory for Penn State is usu-
ally a rarity, and almost always
an upset.

It isn’t an ironclad jinx. State
has won 17 times against 28 Pitt
‘victories. ‘Two ended in ties. It’s
more a state of mind. Pitt simply
refuses to concede the Lions a
chance and they know it. _

The tightening up process which
begins on» the State campus to-
morrow usually. reaches the
breaking point by Saturday. Al-
though they never fall completely
apart, neither do they measure up
to their press clippings.

This contempt for the Lions
must be maddening to State par-
tisans. Last year’s encounter is
a prime example of Pitt’s strange
attitude.

The Panthers had stopped a
State drive on the Pitt 22. It we
midway through the third period
with Pitt leading, 7-o. With su-
preme disdain, Lee faded back

near the Pitt goaline and ﬂipped
to McPeak for 16 yards and a ﬁrst
down. '

From there, the Pitts went on
to score and emerged the ﬁnal vic-

‘ tors, 14-7. State’s highly public-

ized defensive record meant noth-
ing to the Pan.thers. ‘

By Smashing
Phi Eps. '|9-0

Closing its regular league play
with a 19-0 victory over the Phi
Eps, PiKA remained undefeated
and took first place honors in the
American circuit.

Coming out on top in their loop,
the PiKA’s gained the right to
enter the IM playoffs. Their ﬁrst
opponent will be the top team in
the rival National League.

Effective blocking played a big
part in Thursday’s decision. Frank
Daugherty was aided no little by
it on his 30-yard jaunt for the ﬁrst
PiKA counter in the opening per-
iod. 1

Again, in the third quarter, po-
tent interference was displayed by
the victors. Jack Berger put a
 air of blockers to good use at
that time, when he carried from
a point near midﬁeld to the Phi
Eps’ ten yard stripe.

From the ten, on the following
‘play Berger took a reverse and
lugged it over. A key block
thrown by Ken Cochran, enabled
Berger to go all the way.

After scoring twice on the
ground, the PiKA’s took to the
air for their ﬁnal touchdown in

, the fourth quarter.

Riflemen Prepare
For Two Matches

With Christmas vacation fast approaching, the Pitt varsity and
R.O.T.C. riﬂemen are entering their ﬁnal month of pre-season prac-
tice.

1st Lt. H. J. Siegel, newly-appointed ofﬁcer in charge of the riﬂe
teams, revealed that two important intercollegiate matches will be
ﬁred in January. They are the annual William Randolph Hearst
national competition, and the Second Army intercollegiate matches.

Five ﬁve-men teams have been entered by Pitt in the Hearst

matches which will be ﬁred be-9
tween January 1 and March 10.
In the Second Army competition,
extending from January 1 to Feb-
ruary 10, Pitt will be represented
by two 15-man teams.

The Pitt riﬂemen are anxious to
place high in these contests and
regain the supremacy the 1946
Pitt team held in winning the
William Randolph Hearst trophy.

That year they went on to cop the
1946 Third Service Command
crown‘.

Carnegie Tech and Duquesne
university will be Pitt’s oppon-
ents in 12 matches to be ﬁred by
the varsity teams of the three
schools between January 15 and
March 13. Alternate matches will
be ﬁred at the Pitt and Tech rifle
ranges. "

Appointed
Cage Aid  

By Bob Van Atta

The appointment of Tay Ma-
larkey, former Pan-ther cage star,
as aide to Head Coach Dr. H. C.
Carlson was approved Wednesday
by the Faculty Committee on Ath-
letics.

He replaces Bobby Artman, who
recently accepted a position as
athletic director with the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association.

Dr. Carlson, commenting on his
newly-appointed aide, remarked
that “Malarkey ranks with Char-
ley Hyatt, Don Smith and Claire
Cribbs as a player.”

Hyatt, Smith, and Cribbs won
All-American honors under Doc
Carlson.

As a player on the Panther
quintet, Malarkey de onstrated
all-around skill, winning letters
in ’4l, ’42, ’43, and ’45. He was an
outstanding passer, a good defen-
sive man, and a superlative shot.

'1‘ay’s outstanding offensive ef-
fort during his four years as a
letterman was a 28-point per-
formance, against Geneva, when
he sank eleven ﬁeld goals from
mid-court, a phenomenal sharp-
-shooting display.

However, Tay says that his
greatest thrill in his career as a
varsity eager came in his ﬁrst
game, the ’4l Pitt—Il1inois match.
With 25 seconds remaining, the
Carlson ﬁve was two points be-
hind.

At this point, he was inserted
into the lineup. When his team-
mates were unable to work the
ball in close for a shot, they pass-
ed to him. He let fly from center-
court to tie the score. The Pan-
thers won in overtime.

Although he played only bas-
ketball at Bridgeville (Pa.) High,
Malarkey took a crack at foot-
ball here in 1943. An injury re-
quired the wearing of a knee
brace for basketball and curtailed
football altogether.

Prior to his‘ appointment he
held a one-year tenure as head
coach at his alma mater, Bridge-
ville High School, last winter.

Vlfhen the Army classiﬁed Dr."

George L. Fahey as “Essential”,
they really meant it.

Dr. Fahey, professor of psychol-
ogy in the School of Education,
returned to Pitt this summer after
an absence oi over five years.

In 1942, Dr. Fahey, then a pro-
fessor of psychology at the Johns-
town extension, was commissioned
in the Army to serve as a clinical
psychologist.

America’s ten million man army
had only 1,000 trained psychol-
ogists at the height of mobiliza-
tion. As a clinical psychologist,
Captain Fahey was called upon
to supervise testing and condi-
tioning of. new soldiers, and then,
as the war drew to a close, to help
disabled veterans adjust them-
selves to civilian life. A

Dr. Faihey returned to Pitt as
liason officer" "between the School
oi‘ Educa‘tio=n and the department
of psychology. This position was
created this year as a joint func-
tion oi the two units in preparing
and,institL1,ting courses in psychol-
ogy for education students.

Dr. Fahey, a graduate of the
University of Iowa, received his
doctors degree from the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin.

Before taking the position at
Johnstown in 1939, he was prin-
cipal and supervisor of a Wiscon-
sin high school.
