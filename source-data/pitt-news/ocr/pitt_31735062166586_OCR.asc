 

1 State Legislature Stagnates Over University Aid

4

J,»-

by LEWIS M. TAFFER
(See editorial, “A Repeat
Performance,” page 4)

If the University does not
receive its annual aid ap-
nropriations from Harris-
burg by Oct. 1, it will be
forced to borrow‘ from five
to six million dollars from
private sources in order ot keep
operating. In addition, the 40,000
college students who receive
$34.5 million in scholarships are
in immienent danger of losing
this aid.

According to Dr. Robert Bailie,
assistant to the Chancellor and
director of commonwealth re-
lations, the University has been
forced to “suspend payments on
$4.4 million in outstanding loans
and has used this money for op-
erating expenses.” Dr. Bailie
added that Penn State and Tem-
ple University have both been
forced to borrow money from

{7o1ume 62, Number 7

   

private sources to keep operat-
ing. Dr. Bailie said this ﬁnan-
cial crisis is “directly the fault
of the legislature’s failure to
pass the appropriations.” The
University's planned appropria-
tions are $27 million.

Meanwhile, Democrats and Re-
publicans fail to agree to just
how much tax revenue the Gov-
ernor really needs. The Senate
is in a deadlock, and the House,
now in two-week recess, doesn’t
even have a bill in committee
yet. Republican’s lack the votes
to approve the Governor’s $300
million tax bill, while the Demo-
crats, who believe that $220 mil-
lion should suffice, are refusing
to support the Republicans. All
in all, stateaid to higher educa-
tion should amount to $132 mil-
lion.

According to Democratic House
Minority Whip. Rep. K. Leroy
Irvis there is no compromise in
the wind. Irvis claims that while

UNIVERSITY o

 

    

 

Governor Shater claims he must
have nothing less than $300 mil-
lion, the Democrats disagree.
Now that the House is in recess,
Irvis feels the party leadership
could possibly reach a settle-
ment, although he claims that
everything “founders on the
rock of the Governor.”

Senate Majority Leader Re-
publican Robert Fleming dis-

’ agrees and states quite bluntly

that he is “very pessimistic.”
Claiming that the two Republi-
cans who have defected from
the party line cannot be recover-
ed. Fleming put the burden on
the Democrats by claiming, “I
have done all I can. Right now
there are $16 million in the State
Treasury, and we have no mon-
ey to meet our commitments as
of October 15,” Fleming added.

Dr. David Kurtzman, chancel-
lor emeritus of the University
and chairman of the Governor's

‘Tax Study Commission which

recommended a one per cent per-
sonal income tax said, “I don’t
think they ever looked at it too
carefully.” Dr. Kurtzman, now
superintendent for public in-
struction for Pennsylvania, fur-
ther stated his belief that the
University's state-related status
could lead to annual ﬁnancial
uncertainly so long as Pennsyl-
vania has such a hit-and-miss
budgeting system.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s
Editor Frank Hawkins, chair-
man of the State Council on
Higher Education, supports the
recommendations of Dr. Kurtz-
man's committee as “sound.” He
noted the party “balance” in the
state legislature and added that
“the problem will have to be
solved, but the question is when.”

Chancellor Wesley Posvar feels
there is no cause for alarm.
When asked if he felt if this
type of crisis would be annual,
he replied negatively.’ “Budget

hassles are not uncommon, but

this much of a delay is an un- 1‘

usual occurrence,” he stated.
The Chancellor said that the
University was not applying
pressure to get the snag re-
solved because this is “strictly
a political problem among the
leadership of the parties.” The
Chancelolr added that “the state
legislators support us and be-
lieve in us,” but he did concede
that the University would lose
the interest money it would have
to pay should it need to seek
funds from private sources.

There has been much specula-
tion as to whether the Universi-
ty’s new state-related relation-
shop would put it at the mercy
of Harrisburg legislators every
year at appropriations time. In
the opinion of a political scien-
tist at the University, “As long
as the majorities are slim, it is
truly conceivable that -this will
be a yearly occurence.”

MDC and WHB Formulate

Year of Close Interaction

by FRANK ALTMAN

A year of closer coopera-
tion between men and wom-
en dormitory students was
forecast during the first
meeting of the Men’s Donn-
itory Council (MDC) Thurs-
day.

This cooperation will result
f-rom a new line of communica-
tion between the Woman Hous-
ing Board (WHB) and MDC.
Previously, the two organiza-
tions had largely ignored each
other even though they perform-
ed many complementary func-
tions.

Both MDC and WHB have set
up committees to implement
their new policies. Their exact
function is to insure a free ﬂow
of information between the two
groups and to seek out areas for
combined action. Accordingly,
two members of the WHB com-
mittee were present at the MDC
meeting.

Speaking for the women, Val-
ery Jackson, chairman of the
“HB committee, .believes that
more student unity will result
from the new policy, and by act-
ing in the joint interest of both
men and women students, more
student goals can be achieved.
Miss ‘Jackson promised to have
at least one member of her com-
mittee present at each MDC
meeting, just as MDC will be
represented at the WHB meet-
ings.

This new link will enable MDC
and WHB to co-sponsor many
cultural and social events. Bo-th
organizations are already talk-
ing about co-sponsoring Dorm

For all rushees who are un-
decided or for those interested
in getting a better look at the
fraternity system, the Inter-
fraternity Council will hold a

4 to 6 pm. in the SU Ball-
room. Each fraternity will be
represented.

Vietnam Correspondent

Lucas Views War

No progress has been
made in the Vietnam war
since the arrival of the
Americans, stated James G.
Lucas, Scripps-Howard cor-
respondent who first cover-
ed the war in 1964.

Lucas spoke to the World Af-
fairs Council and their guests
at the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel
Friday afternoon. He began his
talk with the statement, “I am
a hawk.”

The World War II Marine
said, “We can bring the war to
an end. We can convince them
(the North Vietnamese) that
‘they cannot achieve their goals
if we apply a little more pres-
sure, cruel as that sounds. War
is a cruel thing. This war can
end any time they are prepared
to talk to us.”

Lucas emphasized that “we
are there for the ‘free interests
of the world. We are doing a
very decent thing for very de-
cent peop-le.” Though he believes
that the effort is “right, just,
and proper,” the correspondent
said that he often found it hard
to accept some of the political
decisions which involve the lives

of the men over there.

After his 30-minute talk, Lu-
cas devoted a half hour to an-
swering written questions col-
lected from the audience. Some
of them were:

Q. Why don’t we want to win
the war?

A. We do, but we are too con-
cerned with our image. The US
is worried about world opinion.
Johnson also fears that by es-
calating the war, he will lose
senatorial support. He should
do what is right and await the
verdict of history.

Q. Why hasn’t any other large
free nation shown an interest in

Dr. Cottam Reviews
Israeli Crisis, Lauds

U — Thant’s

Strategy

by HOBART WHITE

“Since 1948, the possibility of compromise has pretty
well evaporated from between Israel and the Arabs, “Dr.
Richard Cottam, Professor of Political Science, said be-
fore the Collegiate Council for the United Nations last
Thurday night. “The Israelis feel a deep cyrnycism, that
they must show the Arabs themselves. The Arabs, on the

other hand, have reached the
point where they must do some-
thing as basic as to prove they're
men. It has gotten that bad.”

Although Dr. Cotta:m’s pub-
lished topic was “In Defense of
U Thant’s Actions in the Mid-
dle East Crisis,” he went farther
aﬁeld, concentrating on the psy-
chological and ideological prob-
lems that /he feels »hJave preci-
pated many of the problems and
are now preventing their solu-
tions.

“The proponents o-f Israel can-
not accept the fact that the
Arabs are paying a terrible psy-
chological price over Israel's
very existence,” Dr. Cottam said.
"They feel that Israel was placed
in the Middle East by the Im-
perial West and must be elim-
inated.” To illustrate how little
the Israelis and their friends un-
derstand this, Cottam gave the
example of the oft-repated Is-

-reali offer that once peace had

been concluded in the Middle
East, she would use her techni-
cal know-how to help the Arabs
modernize their primitive eco-
nomys. “This is a slap in the
face,” Cottam pointed out.

Against this background of ex-

Panhel Plans

Member of the Panhellenic As-
sooiation of the University are
planning two sets of seven Open
Houses for freshmen, transfer,
and upperclass women. These
women students with last names
beginning with the letters A-L
are invited to attend the Open
Houses on Saturday. Those
whose names begin with M-Z are
asked to attend Open Houses on
Sunday.

 

Open House

Women students need not at-
ten all seven Open Houses, but
are urged to do so. The reply
forms are to be brought in per-
son -to the 12th Floor, CL, be-
tween 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. today
and tomorrow.

These Open Houses have been
planned so that sorority women
and new women students may
have an opportunity to become
better acquainted.

treme Arab-Israeli hatred, Dr.
Cottam reviewed the actions of
the UN, with special emphasis
on U Thant’s role as mediator
between the American and Rus-
sian positions. “The Cardinal
rule of the Secretariat is that
the Secretary General must nev-
er take sides between the US
and USSR. He must always
work within the concensus of
these two powers.” _

In light of these criteria, Cot-
tam felt that U Thant had “per-
formed well.” “The two powers
were at each other’s throats this
year,” Cottam pointed out.
Therefore, he felt that any ac-
tion that U Than.t would have
initiated favoring one -side's posi-
tion over the other’s would have
neutralized his own usefullness,
and perhaps had led to a threat
to his very office, as Dag Ham-

Pitt Graduate Joins Peace Corps;
Laura Layton Teaches

Laura E. Layton, an English
literature major at the Univer-
sity, has recently been named a
Peace Corps Volunteer English
teacher assigned to Tunisia. Miss

Layton graduated from the Uni-

versity last April with a BA
degree.

Miss Layton’s new group of
volunteers will teach in Tunisi-
an secondary schools, employing
the mod-ern, direct method of
encouraging, speaking and un-
derstanding as the means to
build vocabulary instead of rely-
ing on rote memorization.

In addition to their teaching
duties, the volunteers will help
guide extracurricular activities
in sports, music, drama or crafts,
and will teach adult education.

College Student Unions

Skibo Hall at Carnegie-
Mellon University is not a
Student Union, but merely a
Campus Activities Center.
Thomas Mcfeely, co-ordina-
tor of student activities at
Skibo emphasized this fact in
an interview last Friday.

This interview and an inves-
tigation by the Pitt New-s into
the student unions of neighbor-
ing college campuses, was
prompted by the recent contro-
versy concerning the control of
the Pitt Student Union.

Mcfeely noted that Skibo does
not have facilities comparable to
those of the Pitt Student Union.

There is a snack bar and several

meeting rooms which are avail-
able for student use; preference
for the use of these rooms is
given to the students, the pur-
pose of the building being “most-
ly to cater to -the needs of the
students,” according to the di-
rector. He added that there is
no room for either ping pong
tables or pin ball machines such
as a.re provided at this Univer-
sity. Skibo does provide offices
for some student organizations
such as publications and Stu-
dent Government.

When questioned on the sub-

Weekend (last year this was
purely an MDC function) and
hosting a new faculty dinner
program that would invite fac-
ulty members to dine with the
students in the Towers Cafe-
tenia on a weekly basis.

Another area for cooperation
would be the creation of joint
panels and cultural forums. Pos-
sibly one men’s housing unit and
one ﬂoor of the girls dorms
could jointly sponsor a lecture,
a discussion group, or other
events of this nature.

MDC President Terry Gordon
also announced that MDC will
give $80 to each of the men’s
housing units per term. He ex-
pressed the hope that at least
part of the money could be
spent on joint programs with
the WHB.

Another new committee estab-
lished by MDC would be respon-
sible for helping to advise Men's
Council. Their work will include
advising MC on freshman ori-
entation, the freshman advisory
board, and its other normal
functions. Also, they will look
into the possibility of setting up
a judicial board for all men un-
dergraduate students.

ject of the degree of student
control of the Activities Center,
Mcfeely responded that the stu-
dents are consulted whenever
decisions concerning them are
being formulated, however, all
decisions are ultimately made
by the administration. He re-
marked that as the administra-
tive director of Skibo, he is the
direct link between the students,
faculty, and administration. His
office is always open, and stu-
dents can come to him at almost
any time with their suggestions
and/or complaints.

Mcfeely is allocated $1,500 per
semester to provide entertain-
ment for the student body. This
sum allows him to plan a TGIF
dance every other Friday night.
The Student Union Board of the
Activities Center is a committee
of the Student Government, and
has no control in planning
events. On the other hand, the
Pitt Student Union Board pro-
vides many free concerts, ﬁlms,
and dances for the student body
of the University.

At t‘he end of the interview,
Mcfeely added that a new wing
may be built onto Skibo Hall in
the near future.

._ ‘Pitt News’ Investigates   White Armbands to be Worn

By Those Opposed to War

Students for Peace (SFP) at
the University will sponsor the
wearing of white armbands by
faculty and students opposed to
the war in Vietnam. The spon-
sorship will begin this Wednes-
day.

According to Larry Fugman,
a graduate student and origina-
tor of the idea, “The armbands
symbolize ‘stop the bombing and
begin negotiations now, at least.”’
Because many people may ﬁnd
the statement too mild and would
prefer one asking for United
States withdrawal from Viet-
nam, the words “at least” have
been added so that anyone who
is dissatisﬁed with United States
policy on the war can wear an
armband.

Fugman says that armbands
were ﬁrst worn at Stanford Uni-
versity. “A small group of peo-
ple began wearing them,” he
states, "and by the end of the
term half the student body was
wearing an armband on Wed-
nesdays.”

Armbands are being prepared
by members of SFP and will be
available at their literature table
set up in the ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral.

It is hoped that both profes-

A Repeat Performance

We are now witnessing the latest episode of the Republicans vs.
the Democrats in our State legislative chambers. Last year the issue
was the University’s state-relatedness, a fact which did not become
a reality until it was almost too late to result in a tuition reduction
for our Fall Term. This year we are involved once again, as we have
not received any appropriations from the State and must now borrow
the money if the appropriation bills are not passed by Oct. 1.

Since the State House has not yet introduced a bill and is ad-
journed until Oct. 9, the prospects are slim of our receiving our appro—
priation before we are forced to seek money elsewhere. The Senate’s
bill is not yet out of committee, and a Pitt News interview with Senate
Majority Leader Robert Fleming (R.-Allegheny County) indicated the
unlikelihoodof a conclusion being reached in the near future: “I haven’t

the faintest idea of when it will be settled.”

So we are forced once more to sit and wait until both parties gain
the appropriate political mileage from the pros and cons of Governor
Raymond P. Shafer’s tax program. After a majority on each side has
concluded that they cannot suspend the working of state government any

further, a compromise will be reached.

Meanwhile “40,000 collgee students are waiting for their scholar-
ship money from the State—-about $31,500,000 in all——and Oct. 1 is the
deadline for paying the money to the colleges” (The Pittsburgh Press,

In Oakland Area

Sunday, Sept. 24). Fleming stated that only $16 million is presently in
the State Treasury, and that there is obviously no money to meet the
scholarship commitments, let alone the $132 million due the state-aided
universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher learning.

Penn State and Temple have already been forced to borrow money
to meet their operating expenses, just as our University is now in the

process of borrowing. Yet our State Government has still failed to re-

solve the tax problem, jeopardizing not only institutions of higher
learning, but the manifold other programs that depend on their state
aid to meet their expenses.

Even if this year’s crisis is soon resolved, prospects look dim for
the future. One has to seriously question whether these “crises” will be
a yearly occurrence for our University, now that we’re a state—related

institution. Our Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtzman feels that

lators.

A Unified Concern

AN ABBREVIATED list

of Allegheny County hous-

ing laws appearing in the
next issue of the Pitt News
shows that many, if not the
majority, of apartments
rented by students have at
least -one serious violation.
But, as Pam Rob.inson’s ex-
periences show, the individ-
ual student cannot really do

fisxthisgw alz. u*h..th.e...s°ndi-

ions in whlc e hves.
When the Health Depart-

ment inspects a dwelling in-

I habited by a student, they

know that whatever their

, decision about the property,

the tenant will have to go
along with it. If the apart-
ment is condemned, then the
student has to move, even if
there is no other place to
move to. If the inspector ig-
nores violations, the student
tenant cannot point them out
because he is essentially ig-
norant of the law. And, if an

_apartment does qualify for

rent withholding, it is grant-
ed only if the tenants ask for
:it. How many students in the
Oakland area are familiar
with the state’s rent escrow
law?

This situation will continue
as it has in other, similarly

run-down areas, until there
is some sort of unifying force
among the neighborhood’s
residents, in this case, among
the students living off cam-

pus.

THAT UNIFICATION of
a neighborhood works was
proven this summer in the
Manchester and North Side
areas of Pittsburgh. There,
the North Side Community
A’c'tl’6ﬁ Program, under the
‘direction of Richard Riden-
our, Obie Sims, and Judy
Einkelstein, served as a bar-
gaining agent for the area’s
tenants and succeeded °in
having the Health Depart-
ment certify 200 homes for
rent withholding.

Almost all the dwellings
in Manchester should be con-
demned. But, strangely
enough, before the Commun-
ity Action Program uniﬁed
the tenants into one strong
body, the Allegheny County
Health Department had only
certiﬁed two homes in the
comm.unity for rent escrow.

However, when pressure,
in the form of a threatened
rentstrike, unfavorable pub-
licity, and a picket of the
Health Department oﬁ ice was
applied, the residents began

to see that they could do
something about the squalor
in which they lived.

Health department inspec-
tors eventually looked at
nearly every home in Man-
chester and certiﬁcations
were made. Only in a few in-
stances were homes con-
demned outright, not that
those that weren’t condemn-
ed shouldn’t have been, but
because if condemnation
standards were applied across
the board, almost all the res-
idents of the community
would be homeless. The city
of Pittsburgh witha hous-
ing shortage of 9,000 units,
obviously could not ﬁnd relo-
cation housing for such a
large group of people and
placed the burden of repair
on the backs of the landlords
who are responsible for the
conditions.

WITH ALMOST 600 stu-
dents off campus in the Oak-
land area, a program such as
that in Manchester this sum-
mer could succeed here. Pam
Robinsons apartment was
condemned because she was
only one individual. If there
were 500 more students unit-
ed behind her who had also
ﬁled complaints. about their
apartments, she would not be
paying the landlord rent for
an illegally rented apart-
ment but would be paying
into rent escrow. The city
cannot relocate displacedstu-
dents any more than it can
relocate the people of Man-
chester.

A strong union of students
could do more than work
with the problem of poor
housing. It could operate a
food store and sell better
products at lower prices than
the A&P or Giant Eagle. It
could operate a community
center where anyone could
go for meetings, programs,
or just a cup of coffee. But
there is no united student
group at the University of
Pittsburgh. It thus becomes
the responsibility of those
students who are concerned
about the conditions in which
they live and the conditions
which surround them to or-
ganize and do something
about them. It can be done.

 

perhaps we now face “annual financial uncertainty” so long as Pennsyl-
vania has no formula for a tax program. Dr. Kurtzman was appointed
by the Governor to chair a Tax Study Commission, whose sound sugges-
tions were not seriously considered by either the Governor or the legis-

Once more, our elected leaders have allowed the situation to go
too far. We urge them to now direct their ammunition towards finding a
workable solution to the problem instead of towards one another.

Landlord Hits

Abrams Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a landlord in the Oakland
area, a former Pitt undergrad-
uate, and currently a sophomore
in Dental School I would like to
answer Ivan Abrams recent edi-
torial in the Pitt News concern-
ing Off-Campus Housing.

Like most problems there are
two sides to the story. I agree
that many landlords in Oakland
charge exuberant prices for sub-
standard housing, but I think
this is the exception rather than
the rule.

Most landlords are sincere in-
dividuals who have worked hard
to acquire their property and
work continually to improve it.
Most people do not takr: into
consideration the fact tha; prop-
erty costs about twice as much
in Oakland as elsewhere and the
mortgages and monthly p-ay-
ments are extreme. Taxes also
are higher in Oakland and in
the City of Pittsburgh very lit-
tle can be done without a per-
mit and a registered plumber,

carpenter, or electrician; land-*

lords in Oakland just cannot af-
ford their union scale wages. It
is also very costly and discour-
aging to rent a room or apart-
ment, that you have spent a
great deal to remodel, to a stu-
dent and discover two months

later that he has moved out tak- ‘

ing half of your furniture with
him, has burned holes in your
curtains and rugs, written on
the walls, punched and locked
holes in the walls, and owes you
a month rent. It takes two
months and the next two years
income to get the place back
into order. Landlords in Oak-
land can only be assured of rent-
ing their places seven mmths
out of the year and usually
change tenants yearly — which
according to_ the law means re-
painting all the rooms yearly.

Landlords in Oakland must
pay higher ﬁre and liability in-
surance and must constarﬂy act
as a buffer between the irre-
sponsible students and irate
neighbors and the police. Oak-
land landlords have no way of
getting references for students
because most of them have nev.
er rented an apartment before
and most students are un:le.- 21
and are from out of stlte so
neither they nor their parents
can be held responsible. When
all of the disadvantages to rent.

ing to students are added up,
think students are lucky to ﬁnd
-the places they do at the prices
they pay. Like everything else,
the responsible, sincere students
must pay for the irresponsible,
insincere students.

In conclusion, I would like Mr.
Abrams to stop and think what
the University gets for a" two
by four room which is shared
with other people, where 1here
are no cooking privileges, no
television .set or other electrical
devices permitted, strict rules
and regulations, and many peo-
ple share the same bathroom. I
wonder if Mr. Abrams would
like the same situation with off-
campus housing, if so, then we
should ask the University to
control off-campus housing; I’m
sure the landlords would be for
losing some of their headaches.

Witness For The Defense-—Act One

“Easy” Ed Whittaker became a believer Saturday af-
ternoon. So did the rest of the Panther defense.

But whereas the other members of the defensive unit
learned one thing against UCLA, Easy learned two. .

He had played on the offensive line last year. His
job entailed blocking for a couple of plays each quarter
and watching the defense get beat for the rest of the time.

Saturday, Easy, the defensive tackle, watched the of-
fense from the sidelines for a couple of plays and got beat
the rest of the time. “Now I can see what the def'ense was
hollering about last year,” Easy said with sort of a half-
smile in the locker room after the game.

THE DEFENSE spent most of the afternoon de-
fending 40 yards of territory against one of the finest
‘offenses in the nation. UCLA drove 47 yards for its first
touchdown and 48 yards for its second. In between, the
Bruins started drives from the Panther 30 and 47 yard
lines that were stymied by the gridder defense, forcing

~ UCLA to settle for one field goal.

The three times in the first half that the Bruins start-
ed from their own territory, they fumbled the ball to the

Panthers twice. and were forced to punt for the first time

this season.

In all, UCLA ran 44 of-
fensive plays during that
first half. “We were tired,”
Easy admitted, especially in
the first half.” Even so, the.‘
defense came within a foot
of stopping four Bruin
cracks from the five yard
line in the half’s closing sec-
onds.

The second half was the
same story. UCLA’s first
touchdown march was 40
yards and its last one was
56 yards. The defense broke
down on that one,” Whittak-
er said. “We’re going to
have to put it all together
and the offense has to give
us a few drives.”

EASY REALIZED what
the rest of his platoon had
already known. The offense
would have to move the ball
to give the defense a breather and better field position.

The entire defense did gain something from the game.
They, found out that they could do things well at times.
“We looked real good in spots,” said linebacker Lou Par-
rott. “I’m a believer now. We stopped their outside game
and their throw back passing game.”

“We took the long pass away from them,” added de-
fensive backfield coach Bill Lewis. “We’ll have to wait for
the films to see if we were too conscious of their outside
game, which would explain why they could run their backs
back inside. But I’ll say this now. UCLA is so quick that
if you don’t go outside with the flow, they’ll turn the cor-
ner and take off.” - ’

PAUL KILLIAN, Mickey Depp, and Joe Curtin did a
remarkable job in shutting off Gary Beban’s rollouts and
containing his receivers. The Panther linebackers and ends
were hitting hard. “I don’t believe we’ll ever be outhit this
season,” said Lewis.

UCLA coach Tommy Prothro attested to the aggres-
sive Panther defense. “We had a lot of boys banged up,”

ED GALLIN
Sticks Mike Gawratt

he said. “We lost two tackles and our number two quarter-

back.”

Prothro feels that the Panthers are improved of-
fensively “up front and in the passing game” over last
year_. And although the offense didn’t penetrate UCLA
territory _until six and a half minutes were left in the third
quarter, it showed by its one long march and in several
other moments that it has the potential to move the foot-
ball consistently.

IN THEIR FIRST EFFORT, the Panthers had third.
down and six, and third and nine situations, and made
them both. On the 77 yard march that the defense was so
grateful for, the offense made three third, and one fourth
down play. And after the Bruins intercepted for a touch-
down, the Panthers came back to execute a third and six
for a first down.

Both the offense and defense performed well enough
in spots to say, as Easy did, that “when we put it all to-
gether, we’ll be all right.” . L

Aerial Attack Shelved  
From Outs~et;White Out

by GEORGE LIES
Dave Hart mixed his best offensive weapon early in
the game, and called the plays in the Jock Sutherland tradi-
tion of “Hey diddl-ediddle, fullback up the middle,” while
watching UCLA ramble by the Panthers, 40-8, last Saturday in the

Stadium.

It had been Hart's game plan to throw the football, but when
he saw fullback John White gain 23 yards. on three carries, he

wasn’t about to touch a good
thing.

But then qu«a.rt~erback Frank
Gustine fumbled and UCLA’s
Vic Lepisto recovered. And Hart
learn-ed that Whiteis hand had
been broken on the ﬁrsst play.
Seven plays after the fumble,
Gary Beban ran a keeper from
the Jungle Cats’ nine and it was
7-0. After the kickoff, the Pan
ther runners were stymied.

As Gustine, the passer, watch-
ed UCLA’s defense contain Gary
Cramer and Mike Raklewicz,
Hart stood along the sideline;
the game plan in his hands.

The passing game which later
proved very successful in the
Cats’ lone scoring drive had
been ignored by the coaching
staff. ‘

In the locker room after the
game, Hart confessed, “We the
coaches didn’t come to the pass-
ing game soon enough.

“Our plan had been simple.
We would take the kickoff and
move the ball. And we were
moving it, but we didn’t have
enough motion in the offense,”
Hart said.

“In the second half, we did
things we didn’t do in the first
half,” remarked Hart.

The mistakes of a sophomore
quarterback were to be taken
for granted, but the injury to
White was ill-fortune. He is the
fourth backﬁeld runner to be
scratched from the Panther
squad since the season began.

With Hart’s “best blocker”
now out for a month, Gustine
had trouble with handoffs, and
other backﬁeld assignments were
missed. “His absence hurt us,”
said Hart. “It threw our timing
off’ for the whole game. We
were forced to use players at
different positions.”

Rakl-ewicz switched to full-

back, not an unfamilar spot, but
one he had not practiced all
week. Cramer was moved to
tailback, and then interchanged

The True Story

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor
Only the murmurs and the whispers of
defeated men could be heard in the Pan-

thers dressing room Saturday. But inside
that door which separates the football world from
the real one, the smell of Wintergreen opened
noses and the soft spoken words of quarterback
Frank Gustine opened ea.rs. ‘

After all,’ it was his ﬁrst collegiate game as
quarterback of the Panthers. He had made mis-
takes o-ut on the ‘ﬁeld, and now there would be
time to replay missed signals and fumbles and
interceptions.

As he lay with a white towel draped around
his waist on the trainers’ table, the young ﬁrst
string quarterback could have been looking ahead
to next Satu-rd«ay’~s game against Il-.linois, but
instead he answered reporters’ questions, one by
one, slowly and articulately.

Where you nervous in the game, Frank?

“Yes, I was until I started breaking a sweat.
Then I felt pretty much settled,” said Gustine,
smiling and eager for the next question.

Although coach Dave Hart said you hold the
football like a loaf of bread, in the game, you
ran better than some people thought you could;
what about it?

“I’m really not a ‘bad runner as people say. I
think I’m okay, but Jeff Barr is an excellent
runner.”

Frank, there was one play, a fourth down and
less than a yard . -. .

“Oh that one. Coach Hart really jumped on
me for that call, Before the game, we decided
that I would sneak for anything less than a yard.
But . . . I thought R.-ak (Mike Raklewicz) was
the best carrier, but he didn’t get the ﬁrst down.
And when I gotpto the sidelines, I got it. It was
deﬁnitely my fvaurlt.”

What about those two interceptions?

F rank Gnstine: “Glad Hart Stayed With Me”

By “The Bomlb"
FRANK GUSTINE, starting his ﬁrst collegiate game at quarter-
back, completed nine of 19 passes for 83 yards in the Panthers’
40-8 loss to UCLA Saturday. Gustine also displayed a ﬁne ability
to run when tapped. A

“Well . . . when I got to the line, I called auto-
matics because of the UCLA defense and I
changed the play. But I threw the bail inside and
Bobby Longo stayed outside. I overthrew the
other one.”

Did you ever want to second guess Hal-t’s play

K calling?

“No. Deﬁnitely not. We talked over everything
before the game and I was satisﬁed with every-
thing he called. I'm with coach Ha-1 100 per cent
I can’t outguess the coach. I gotta have respect
for coach I-Iart just as evervone who plays for
him does.”

Are you glad he stayed with you for the entire
game?

“Yes. I think it was the best decision he could
have made. Even if Jeff Barr would have started,
the best thing for the team was to have the quar-
terback go the whole game. Jeff and I  it
over. He’s my roommate and we're good friends,
and it would be good for both of us.”

Why did you still try to pass when you —were
being tackled?

“Because I sensibly feel I can make it. We
have outstanding receivers. Boblby Longo is an
All-American. Did you see the Way he caught
that one with the guy hanging on his back?”

Then before any more questions were asked,
Gustine’s father, Frank, Sr., Walked in. “Good
game son, good game,” he said. It marked the
end of an interview, but what Frank, Sr. said
brought to mind what UCLA coach Tommy Pro-
thro had said.

“I was very impressed with the quarterback.
ing of Frank Gustine, Jr., especially with his
throwing as a sophomore,” said Prothro, who
was quite a quarterback himself.

And what was I-I-art's reaction to his opening
day choice? “I didn’t think ahvl hing went wrong
with Gustine, He is going to be some quarter
back for us.”

Fresh Stay “Perfect”

by ART ROSENGAR-TEN

While most of the University community was at the
Stadium Saturday afternoon, coach Jim Banner’s varsity
and freshman distancemen were running at Kent State

University.

In a triangular meet with
Kent and Ohio University, the
varsity (70 points) ﬁnished a
third to Kent (23) and Ohio U.
(42). But -the freshman scored
their second perfect score as
they defeated the Kent frosh,
15-50.

“Against an exceptionally good

_ teamn (Kent State), the boys did

a real good job, even though
the score doesn't indicate it,”
said Banner at yesterday's prac-

tice in Schenley Park. “Truth-,

fully, we were -strictly under-
classed in the varsity meet as
Kent State had a few interna-
tional runners,” reﬂected Ban-
ner. '

Two of these international
runners were winners, Sam Bair
and Ed Norris of Kent State,
who ﬁnished in a dead‘ heat with
:4. time of 31:14.1 minutes for
the six mile course.

Bair has a host of records and
ﬁne performances to his credit.
These include a second place
ﬁnish to Jim Ryun in the NCAA
mile, a second place ﬁnish in
the 1500 meters at the Pan
American games and the two
mile record in the Penn Relays.

The best finish by a varsity
barrier was seventh place by
Paul Greig in a time 33:46.5
“Considering that the boys have
done very little speed work this
season, Greig’s performance was
very good, considering the com-
petition,” Banner said.

The freshmen team continued
its ﬁne performance. Banner is
proud of this freshmen squad
which has all the qualities of a
winning team, especialy the de-

.sire to win.”
. Jerry Richey captured his ﬁrst ,
V Collegiate win. He ran the f0U1‘

  
 

mile course in a time of 21:10.5.
"Jerry is a real good, hardwork-
ing boy, but then so is the rest
of the squad,” said Banner as a
slight smile crept across his
face.

The other ﬁve ﬁnishers were
Greg Rodgers (21:23), Mark
Vornhagen (21:46), -‘John Cro-
zier (21:47), Mike Nolan (21:50),
and Bil Matajasick (21:24).

The next time the teams com-
pete will be Saturday afternoon.
They host N. Y. State College
at Buffalo on the Schenley Park
course.

ERNIE MOUEN
Starts Against MSU

Scoring Punch Still Missing

“It didn’t go well,” moaned Bemis. “It never does when

you lose.” The booters lost 2-0.

Saturday’_s loss to West Chester was the second

straight -shutout suffered by the
soccermen this season. In last
week’s opener they lost to [Frost-
burg, 1-0.

There were two changes in
Bemis’ starting lineup. Sopho-

-more Ron Mieiecki started at

right halfback. He replaced Er-
nie Mouen who was suﬁering
from a severe sprain in his
ankle. Mouen got into the game,
but only for a few minutes.
“He couldn't play too long,”
explained Bemis, “His foot was
weak. But Ernie should be able
to start next Saturday’s game
against Michigan State.”
Shelton Zvoma, a senior who

Down Like Titanic;GirlsAtop

A feeling of shock hung over the whole room. On the advice
of doctors, all razor blades, letter openers, and other sharp objects
had been removed from the area. The Yogies were about to dis-

cuss their ﬁrst weeks’ picks.

“It was a ﬂuke,” said the intrepid leader of the sports staff,
“Flatbush” Ros-ens-tein, of his last place, 8-7, card. “The week meant
nothing and there are a big nine weeks to go. Besides, it's easy to
see I have no competition.” Despite his brave words, it is rumored
that “Fl~atbnsh” asked LBJ to declare the Yogis a disaster area.

‘‘That’s the last time I pick the girls who pick the games,” in-
sisted George “Mons-tachio” Lies. The “M-ousrt~a‘chio’s” choices, Jane-t
Brozer and Margie Moore, combined for an 11-4 mark which gave
them a two game lead on the ﬁeld. Tlhe “Moustachio’s” own choices
faired less well as he ﬁnish-ed with a 9-6 card. That tied him with
Mike “Hawk” Brourman and Linda “Beulah” Goldstein for third

place.

The “Hawk,” when informed of “Moustachio’s” remarks, had a
reply ready. “Of course, he won’t pick the girl again,” snarled the
“Hawk.” Because he doesn’t know anymore girls.” As for his own
picks, the “Hawk” was unconcerned. “There’s no sense making a
rout of this too early. I'll wait ’til next week to pull away.”

When “Beulah” was asked about her choices she declined to
answer. “I‘m too busy to talk,” wooshed the Big Wind as she shuf-

lettered last year, started at
right wing. He played most of
the game. “He’s in pretty good
shape,” said Bemis, “West Chest-
er had a pretty good fullback
and he didn’t get ‘inside too
much, but Zvoma will do better.

Despite the loss, Berni-s seem-
ed a little optimistic. “We play-

ed a strong game,” claimed Be- _ 

mis, “They weren't able to con-
trol the game. They ou=tsho.rt us

about 2-1 and they out cornered .. ‘

us. But as far as play on the
ﬁeld, we controlled as much of
the game as they did. Some of
their shots were long.”
Bemi-s singled out fullbaacks
Joe Kruth and Norm Roux in

leading the defense. “They both‘
played especially strong games,” I

he said.

But the. oﬂense still lacks the
scoring punch needed to win At
this time last year the booters
scored ﬁve goals while .splituing
their ﬁrst two games. Then they
were shoutout by Michigan State,

6-0. This year they're winless
and scoreless in two games with 

Michigan State visiti-n-g next
week. ”

“With Mouen back next week,”
hopes Bemis, “We should be able
to give Michigan State a good
game.”
