“ Prof'sRadiation Alarm Lock May Be Clue To Death

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Although Pennsylvania officials
have detected a rise in the level of
radiation in local milk supplies,
experts are discrediting a warning
by Pitt Professor Ernest Sternglass
that the levels could have a
detrimental effect on young and
unborn children.

The rise in radioactivity (50 times
normal, according to state reports)
comes in the wake of a Chinese
nuclear test in the atmosphere about
two weeks ago. The fallout, carried

by winds from the test site to the L

continental United States, have

Police Union

Will Resume

Negotiationsi
mmmmoxm

A Campus Police walkout is likely
within the week if contract proposals
are not resolved, according to union
officials. _

State Mediator Tom Quinn will
reopen negotiations between the
Pitt’s Office of Labor Relations and
the Amalgamated Plant Guards
Union Local 502 this morning.

“This meeting,” Quinn said,
“will attempt to bring the opposing
parties together to discuss the
unresolved issues.”

Three. of the 18 unresolved
proposals causing the most dissen-

' sion between the two groups include
the amount of a wage increase,
number of working hours and the
bidding for shifts and beats, Chief
Union Steward John Forgie said.

The Teamsters have already
‘agreed to 15 of the 33 proposals, but
Forgie explained these proposals
“were only giving us what we
already had in our last contract.”

The Campus Police are demand-
ing awage increase of $1 .50 per hour
to compensate for a cost-of-living
rise over the past three years, while
the University is offering $.60 per
hour wage increase over the next
three years.

The Campus Police now work an
eight-hour shift, which includes a
paid half hour for lunch, keeping
their radios on. The University is
proposing eight-and-a-half hour
shifts, with an unpaid half hour for
lunch, with their radios turned off
and beats uncovered during this
time."

In the past. officers were
permitted to bid for shift assign-
ments and locations by seniority.
The University is proposing to give
the lieutenant on duty the right to
assign the shifts and work areas.

dropped more radioactivity on
Pennsylvania than expected, ac-
cording to state health officials in the
Bureau of Radiological Health.

Sternglass recently warned the
radioactivity could have a dangerous
effect on consumers, particularlythe
young, but Dr. Bernard Cohen of
Pitt’s physics department said the
radiation poses no .threat.

“By drinking a glass of this milk,
people will subject themselves to
about the same level of radiation that
people in Colorado receive every 20
minutes, ’ ’ Cohen stated, dismissing
the Sternglass warnings. .

He said the radiation increase,
according to‘ expert studies, pre-
sent no danger. A

“The National Academy of
Science rejected Stemglass’s find-

" ings, ’ ’ Cohen said, “and so have any

professional expert committee I can
think of, including the National
Committee on Radiation Protection
and Measurement.

‘ ‘I think it would be safe to say the
health physics profession has
rejected Sternglass’ contentions,”
Cohen stated.

The radiation causing concern V

here in Pennsylvania is mostly
iodine 131, an isotope of iodine
which is consumed by cows eating

contaminated grass and then‘

concentrated in cow’s milk. The
isotope has a half-life of about eight
days, which means its potency is
reduced by half every eight days.

Police still have not determined
whether Pitt freshman John N.
Behnk~—’s death was due to murder or
suicide and are asking for the
cooperation of Pitt students in

~tracking down the source of a lock

found on the youth’s body.

Behnk, 18, a freshman engineer-
ing student, was found ﬂoating feet
up last Thursday in the Mononga-
hela River. He had been missing
since the weekend of Saturday, Sept.

'25, when he attended a post-game

rush party at the Triangle fraternity
house, 268 N. Belleﬁeld.

A spokesman for the Pittsburgh
police homicide division said a lock
was attached to the chain which was
found draped around Behnk’s body.

-The master combination had the

serial number 902691 on the back,
and locks with serial numbers close
to that number are being sold in an
Oakland store. *'

Police are asking that anyone with
a Master lock with a serial number
one above (902692) or one below
(902690) the lock found with Behnk
contact fhem.

Police said last night they are still
pursuing their investigation of the
death from both angles——-murder or
suicide. “We are conducting a
number of tests now, but- in the
meantime we don ’t want to leave any
stone unturned,” a detedtive
spokesman said.

Although Behnk was last seen
leaving the fraternity house at about

_ 11:30 p.m. the night ofthe party, his

mother had said it is not believed the
death and the party were related.
The police offered no comment on
the matter.

University officials have denied
reports by local mediaearlier in the
week that they did not cooperate in
the search for Behnk during the ﬁve
days he was missing.

‘ ‘Ifirst found out he was missing a
week ago Monday, and l’ve spent all
of my time on it since,” Director of
the Freshman Engineering Program
Alan Brainard said yesterday.

“The image of the University
being cold and not caring about its
students is totally untrue , ’ ’ Brainard
said.

Pitt Parking Problems

Surface In Area Study  

BYBILLMOORE

0akland’s parkingproblem prob-
ably dates back to when cars were

g first ‘seen on campus.

It is no secret that there are too
many automobiles visiting the
University area each day, and too
few places to park them.» A_ recent
study by the University Center for
Urban Research on students’
attitudes towards Pitt shows how the
parking problem affects students.

BY TOM WASELESKI

Senator Robert Dole, -GOP vice
presidential candidate, addressed a
gala party fund raiser last night at
the William Penn Hotel.

He told some 1,000 Republicans at
the $250-a-plate dinner the race is
neck-and-neck and that Republicans
have an excellent chance to sweep

Pennsylvania and the nation “by a A

much wider margin than anyone
expects.

“The solid south is starting to
crack,” the Kansas Senator said.
‘ ‘Andthat’s because Carter parades
somewhere as a liberal, then
somewhere else as a conservative.
You can’t have both.”

Dole said that in the first debate
President Ford showed knowledge
of the country's problems and an
ability to deal with them.

“Jimmy Carter likes to use buzz
words like loopholes, and he says the
rich pay no taxes,” he said. “Well,
why.doesn’t he make available his
tax returns? He took an investment
credit in 1975-1 guess if it
benefitted him it wasn't aloophole. ’ ’

(Continued on Page 3) ‘

'6 The study showed that 67% of the
students, including‘ part-timers. and
night students, own cars, and 73% of
the car ownerstravel to school alone.
About 21% carry one passenger,
four per cent bring two passengers‘
and only 1.4% bring more than two’
passengers.

Over half of those driving to
campus say it normally takes them
10 minutes or less to ﬁnd a parking
place, 28% take up to 20 minutes.

and 13% said theyneed more than 20
minutes. Night students generally
needed more time than day
students.

‘Most of the respondents said they
used metered parking spaces (38 %]
or non-metered street parking
(31%), with the remaining fraction‘
using parking lots or rented garages.

Not surprisingly, the most
frequent suggestion for improving
the situation was to construct more
lots, followed by providing cheap
student parking.

In regard to the heavy traffic
ﬂowing through Oakland in a day
(more than through center city
Philadelphia), many students sug-
gested the need for better street

signals, student crosswalks and‘

controlled street speed limits. Areas
cited as particularly dangerous were
Bigelo Boulevard, O'Hara Street
and Forbes Avenue.

Although few students said
encouraging use of public transpor-
tation would help alleviate parking
or traffic problems, the author of the
study suggested more public transit
could help. Only 13% of students
said they used a PAT bus every day,
and 56% used one occasionally.
About 92% said they have never
used one of the Pat U-buses. '

Most bus riders said they were
satisfied with the competency of the
drivers, the frequency of bus service
and number of different routes.
The major complaints were the cost
and service at night. '

The improvement cited mo st often
were more frequent service,
especially at night, lower fares,
better drivers and new bus routes.

  Four Party Representatives

BY MREA CS ORBA

Minority party representatives
challenged the ability of the
Democratic or Republican parties to
provide a “real” choice for
American voters this November in a
debate at Pitt Monday night.

Representatives of four Presiden-
tial contenders of the Republican,
Democratic, Socialist Workers and
the Communist parties spoke before
a small crowd of 70 people in a
seminar room in 'the Cathedral of
Learning.

Linda Jennes, 1972 Socialist
Workers presidential candidate,
began the debate, calling the recent
Ford-Carter debates a “gentle-

‘ men’s debate” white-washed of any

major political snags.

 

Program Includes:

“Why were the debates boring?
Because the positions of the two
candidates are virtually the same.
They agree on anti-abortion, on
anti-busing. But the major
agreement between the two was to

exclude ‘from the debates the

minority parties who could confront
them with the real issues,” Jennes
said. “The debate was lily-white,
with no blacks or women or any

' groups present that could really
-challenge their positions.

“Thre great fraud behind those
debates was the two candidates were
posing as the only choice while the
real alternative parties were locked
out of the event.”

‘ ‘The Democrats and Republicans
claim to be majority parties, but the
fact is even the two combined do not

represent the majority. Ford or
Carter will win the election on less
than half of the popular vote.”

Larry Seben, a 22-year-old
graduate of Penn State representing
Carter, backed Jennes on this point.
“The projected less than‘40 or 50%
turnout of eligible voters for the
November election indicates serious
trouble for this country.”

He argued for Carter’s plan to
revamp the federal government,
ridding Washington of needless
expenditures. “It if means starting
at zero and building up again, it’ s got
to be done. There are incredible
wastes within the military. The
defense budget could be reduced $5
billion without serious maleffect,”

' he said. ,

an injection of morality. “U.S.
secret policies with Haiti and Africa
should end,’ ’ he said. Governmental

* agreements should be worked out in

the open,” Seben said, referring to
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’ s
muted involvement in the South
African situation.

Rasheed Storey, a local organizer
of the Communist Party, charged
Kissinger feels safe in supporting
the blacks against Rhodesia’s
apartheid system because that
policy does not endanger the drive
for wealth by the rich whites in this
country.

“Kissinger is willing to dole out a
billion dollars to implement ‘prefer-
ential treatment’ of blacks in Africa
but supported the court decision that
preferential treatment of blacks in

this country is ‘reversed discrimina-

tion,” Story said.

He also said the only way voters
will activate signiﬁcant reforms
from the two major parties is to scare

' them into action. “The government

moves when they see the Commun-
ist hand almost on power, so whether
you agree with the Communist
platformvor not, vote for us, if you
want reforms initiated.”

William Schotﬁeld, a Shaler
Township school board member
representing the Republican Party,
in turn urged the audience to vote
within the traditional two-party
system. “You have two choices in
November, with the minority parties
forming the loyal opposition. There
is no question of the honesty and
personal integrity of the minority
parties’ candidates, but can they do
the job after November second?

‘ ‘The country needs restructuring
after the excesses of the Democratic
Congress, ” Schotﬁeld said. ‘ ‘Presi-

dent Ford has come up through the ‘

ranks of the party system and has

done his job while maintaining his
personal integrity. He will
compromise issues but never
principles.”

He urged the audience to vote so
as not to elect a president by default.

There were no major disagree-
ments between the Ford and Carter
representatives but a question from
the floor regarding the differences
between the Socialist Workers and
the Communist Party split the ‘loyal
opposition’ wide open. Jennes
admitted ‘the Communist Party
made a tremendous stride forward in
1917 but since then, Russia has
evolved into a “totalitarian, reac-
tionary government,” she said.
“Russia is not a democracy
controlled by the people who work
there,” Jennes said.

The Socialist Workers spokesper-
son then accused the Communist
Party of being against the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA), of
supporting the Russian invasion of
Czechoslovakia and of compromis-
ing their ideology by fronting
candidates themselves but suppor-
ting some Democratic election
candidates.

Storey responded that the ERA
“grants equality in form but not in
fact. “The ERA does not touch the
proﬁt system under which this
country operates, and so ERA
supporters are just playing the
bourgeoise game,” Storey said.

“We ﬁght all Trotskyism, all
Maoism, all bourgeoise parties on
the international scale,” Storey
said, defending the Czechoslov-
akian invasion.

The debate closed on a humorous
note with a question from the floor
asking the Republican representa-
tive if, in light of Ford’s veto-happy

‘ record, whether Ford would veto a

bill about Christmas.

provide for more dining space,
according to manager John “Hawk-

dining area and its kitchen facilities,
manager Lou LaManna said.

Peter’s Pub will expand its dining
area into the adjacent space
previously occupied by the M & J
Barbershop which has moved across
the street. Peter’s Pub’s expansion
should be completed by Christmas,
Smith said.

The Decade’ will expand into the

“There will be more police and
more police dogs on the street

situation,” he said. “And students

He contends that with three to ﬁve
“incidents” on weekend nights
there is enough night life in Oakland.

es,” Ferlo said.

Montefiore

BY RICH HARRY

Monteﬁore Hospital will begin
physical expansion soon with the
construction of an $18 million
six-story patient tower, a hospital
spokesman said recently.

The 73,000 square-foot tower, to
be built atop the south wing of the
hospital’s Katz Pavilion, is part of
Montefiore’s Phase V capital
development program which also
includes future renovation of
existing south, east and west wings
of the 47-year-old Pavilion.
Renovation will begin after con-
struction of the tower in 1979 and is
expected to be completed within
five to seven years.

The tower project, which should
be started this month, will contain
five patient ﬂoors, each containing
35 beds in 17 semi-private rooms
and one isolation room. An
additional floor will hold ofﬁces for
administrative and other services.

_Each patient ﬂoor also will
maintain sevices such as nurse
stations, patient lounges and
conference and utility rooms.
Patient rooms also will be provided
with special reading and exam-
ination lights.

According to a Montefiore
Hospital statement, Phase V plans
calling for renovation of older
sections in the hospital’s board of
trustees “to replace outdated
facilities and provide the comm-
unity with the quality of facilities
necessary for the practice of 20th
century medicine.”

Design of the tower was
developed by architects in 1975,
the statement added.

Montefiore President Milton
Porter, indicated goals of the Phase
V program include full devel-
opment of a modern teaching
hospital of about 515 beds and
training programs for medical and
paramedical personnel. Goals also
call for continuation and expansion
of ambulatory care and community
service programs, he said.

Survey lsTl1e Answer

Like the legendary Phoenix rising out of the ﬁre, the new plan for
student surveys of teaching effectiveness could be a rebirth of the
Undergraduate Academic Review (UAR). Only the new plan would be a

healthier offspring than its parent.

The new plan was presented to the Provost by the Committee on the

Evaluation of Teaching. It would elevate the Center forthe Evaluation of
Teaching from the College of Arts and Sciences to the Provost’s level.
University-wide evaluationofteachingbystudentswouldbe directed and
the data -correlated by this center within the Provost’s oﬂice.
Forthose whohaveforgotten, the old UARwas a student-rim teaching
evaluation. Anypnofessor couldrefusetobereviewedbythe publication.
Even after the correlation of the results, a professor could stop their

_release.

The UAR dwindled into a review of courses taught by professors
conﬁdentoftheirpopularitywith students. Itbecameuseless to students

and support for it vanished.

Around this camp_us, when tenure time rolls aroimd, it seems that
professors are rewardedfor publications rather than teaching 
This can do nothing but help accumulate poor teaching and -piles of

ipuhiished writing at this University.

‘A A yearly teaching survey could set up a system of check and balance to
alleviate this problem. Placing it within the Provost’s office will give it
enough authority to get the job done thoroughly. A faculty-student
adviscryboard, calledforinthe report, will help insure that the process is

just.  

Taking the survey yearly, and publishing the supplementary student
surveys, would make this a useful program. For a teaching evaluation to
be taken seriously, no punches should  pulled.

Assembling the results in a dossier to be included in a candidate’s
tenure review hearings would someday create what. is needed at this-
University, afacultythat is not only well published, but also teaches well.

The issue of political consid-

thinkers in the academic main-

another trade, like poaching.

The debate raging on campus
and at faculty meetings ﬁnds its
way to the most unlikely places,
including a small, ill—lit bar on the
fringes of campus -where professor

glass of Stroh's.

“l have no patience with fools
who babble about tenure dec-
isions," Jennikins said, speaking
from 10 years of experience as a
senior faculty member in the
department.

“What laymen (his intonation of

BY BILL MOORE’

One University official has
already suggested to student
leaders that they consider exactly
what they will do if campus police
negotiations fail and a strike
develops.

“Hide.," one student mumbled
under his breath. That, at ﬁrst
glance, at least, seems like the best
suggestion.

But there is validity to the
administrator’s advice. Something
will have to be done.

BEHIND THE LINES

It could be a very trying time for
Pitt students. This.campus is not
the safest place to be as it is,‘and
without the additional security
provided by the campus police
force, things will deﬁnitely deter-
iorate.

It is hard to say how bad things
could become. There still will be
the city police ofﬁcers patrolling
outside campus buildings and
presumably they will enter the
buildings if they are called.

Odds are, however, that the city
police won’t be as close as campus

‘police usually are, nor will they be

as familiar with the sort of
problems we have here. _

It is hoped that someone high in
have
enough foresight to work out an

.argreement with city police as to

exactly what they will and will not
do, and that they will do it in plenty

tenure. He’s driving a cab now I
think, unless the suicide note was
more than a play for staff
sympathy. . . ‘ ‘

Jennikins took a moment to ﬁll
his glass again from the pitcher of
an associate slumped into a coma at
his elbow.

“I remember when I was a junior
faculty member the kind of thing
you had to go through to get tenure
in the department. Every morning
“the chairman would stop by to
check your fingernails. Those who
let dirt collect were out on their
ears in a month.“

Jennikins snorted in reminiscent
glee. “Old Warthog was one hell
of a chairman. You didn't see him
taking any of this qualiﬁcation
crap. There was a man who
recognized -the real needs of the
department. Mer. who would keep
their noses and fingernails clean,
their politics to tnemselves and
would pay their fair share of the
coffee kitty...

‘‘I’m not saying one or two craps
didn't sneak in on qualiﬁcations
alone,” Jennikins admitted
frankly, blinking his blood-shot

Iwant to express my gratitude to The Eleven professors who alerted us
to the peril confronting science and rationality on our campus. Their
warning in Monday’s Pitt News comes just in time, too, with Halloween
goblins soon to be loose among us.
While I cannot presume to speak for the entertainment offerings of the
Office of Student Activities’, I am greatly concerned by the reference to the
non-credit course on “The Darker Side of the Supernatural” in our
Informal Program for community adults. My hasty investigation
discloses that this course is taught by one of our associate provosts, Dr. V
Robert Ncssen, and that it treats necromancy, witchcraft and similar 9*"
topics much as some of the University’s credit courses treat Greek
mythology and the like. [report this not to defend exposing community _
adults to such perilous matter but rather to suggest that The Eleven J
expand their crusade to investigate the classics department and perhaps "
others. Maybe some anthropology courses, Alex, where I understand
shamans and witchdoctors, totems and taboos are discussed before
“Johnny and Janey, ’ ’ as our Pitt students were called. This may be more
than The Eleven can handle alone, though. Therefore I suggest that all
faculty members and students who are similarly aggitated by the peril to
science and rationality immediately telephone one of The Eleven to enlist
intheir crusade. To facilitate doing so, the names of The Eleven are
printed here just as they appeared in Monday’s issue, with only their 
extension numbers added for convenience.

Pete's Austerity Hurts Cops

The fashion in which Mayor
Flaherty systematically destroyed
this city's police force is the only
reason for Pittsburgh's abrupt
increase in crimes of every type.
First, he quit replacing men who
were killed in the line of duty, ﬁred,
pensioned or resigned for any
reason. It must be noted that most
resignations were in protest against
his policy of a muffled and muzzled
force. Their power dwindled under
this bung1er’s methods until the
force is at a third or less of the
strength it should be. Officers with
no longer any backup men nor
reserves to call upon themselves
become useless by the simple means
of the old slow down, avoiding
trouble spots, failing to “see”
crimes happening and‘ simply
refusing to any longer risk their own
lives because one man thinks that
reducing taxes is something to crow
about and pat one’s self on the back
;about. His surpluses proved thathe
was playing a rotten game.
I Political science teaches that the '
secret of a successful democracy is
full employment and much of that
employment must be governmental.

And that to wind up any year with a
surplus is a certain sign of failed
governing. All communities need
full use of all taxes to keep from
deteriorating into a city in reverse
like Pittsburgh has become under
Flaherty. This man has shown how a
city can be changed from most
advanced in the nation (under the
great Davey Lawrence) to the most
receded in the nation (under the
do-nothing austerity of a man who is
so infanitle he puts his name on
garbage cans). This man has
shamed our city; the petition to recall
should have been undertaken by the
people of Pittsburgh and not those of
Philadelphia, where a man is being
hounded because he tried to keep
law and order.

Our group now forming is
tentatively entitled TAXPAYERS
TO BRING BACK PRIDE TO
PITTSBURGH. Sneaky Pete will

probably be gone before we get a_

chance to picket city hall and
‘demand increased taxes and an

increase in the police and every other

service that F laherty has destroyed.

Imagine a city without a public safety
Tdirector! Insane!

Thank Divine Providence that this

man is too narrow, selﬁsh‘ and

ignorant of humanitarian respon-

sibilities to ever rise to the height
that the Longs and other of his ilk did
in Louisiana. He has already had a
taste of what the people outside
Pittsburgh thought of him when he
failed at a senate try. He will ﬁnd out
that certain old home owners who
voted for him here will not be in
sufficient number statewide to again
enable him to attain any political
office under false pretenses. I’m
sure these senior citizens who are
being robbed and maimed in their

untaxed homes today wish they had ~

voted for law and order and taxes to
pay for it.

BUTZ PAYS PRICE FOR
“GROSS INDESCRETION”

WASHINGTON (AP)—Earl Butz
said his farewells yesterday to top
officials of the Agriculture Depart-
ment, which he headed for ﬁve
years, while his temporary succes-
sor assured them Butz’ policies
would be continued.

Butz, who resigned Monday for
making a racial slur, denied a report
that he had held secret meetings to
advise the department's Coopera-
tive Extension Service of ways to
avoid hiring more blacks.

John A. Knebel, former undersec-
retary of agriculture who now’ is

_acting secretary of agriculture, said . I

the report, ﬁrst published in the Los
Angeles Times, was “crassly
wrong.”

Knebel and Butz met together
with the 40 or more agency heads
from the far-ﬂung department.

Knebel said in an interview: “I-

don’t think there’s any difference
whatsoever between my policies and
those of the secretary. The
differences will be in style and
delivery."

Butz, 67, resigned Monday as
“the price I pay for a gross
indiscretion’ ’ in making a racial slur

during an airplane conversion last

August. The comments, with
obscenities, in which he referred to
blacks as “colored,” were reported
last week.

T.V. Shoots It Out For Hits

BY RON NYSWANER

It seems to be in vogue to speak
of television-watching as akin to
being lobotomized. While much of
television is intellectually deaden-
ing, it is however——besides being

fun and easy entertainment-—~the
’most important communicative

institution we have.
This new television season is the

" setting for one of the fiercest rating

battles in the industry’s history. The
reason: ABC, for years the third

 network, shook up the Nielson
’ 1{._' ratings last year by pulling in big

audiences with hits like Happy Days,
Laverne and Shirley and guts-and-

  , guns shows like Starsky and Hutch.

Innovation is not ‘a favorite

L i weaponofnetworkexecutives. They

tend instead to rely upon well-worn
formats, hence the spin-off boom of
thelast few years. With competition
high this season, CBS and ABC
particularly, are taking few risks.
NBC, now in third place, is gambling
with two relatively new concepts.
Last summer's successful mini-

series Rich Man, Poor Man is the

inspiration for this season’«s’NBC

A .BestSellers, a one hour, weekly
show. of book adaptations. Captain

and the Kings, by Taylor Caldwell, is
the first novel to be adapted. NBC
should do well with this format,
judging not only from the success of
the original summertime sl_eeper,

but also from the appeal P'BS’s

Masterpiece Theatre, which has a
similar format.

NBC’s most risky gamble is with
its Sunday night Big Event. This
show attemps to turn television into
spectacle, using successful movies,

' imore book adaptations, Hollywood

premieres and variety specials. The
risk here is that viewers may like
familiar and predictable patterns
better than something so ﬂexible.
Eight of the 24 new shows are
comedies. Holmes and Yoyo, which
tries to make a bionic policeman
funny, and Mr. T and Tina, which
tries to make an ethnic joke funny,
are throwaways and will probably be
among the first to go when the
networks do mid-season cleaning.
Alice, taken from the movie Alice

Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, tries
for much broader humor than the
film attempted. Its characters are
sharply limited, but because they
are played so well—-especially Linda
Lavin’s Alice—the chances for
growth are quite good.

There is a similar problem with
All’s Fair, in which a left-wing
photographer and a conservative
columnist fall in love while working
on assignments. Here again the
characters are rigorously defined
and the show depends mostly upon
the original situation for laughs.
Bernadette Peters and Richard
Crenna are so good, though, that this
show may become the hit of the
season.

season is The Quest, in which a white
man turned Indian, and his
brother—a white man turned into
medical student—look for their
sister, from whom they were
separated years before.

This old plot-line (Remember
when Walter Brennan went search-
ing for his long lost son?) is just an
excuse to get actors Kurt Russel and
Tim Matheson into bars, brothels
and ﬁghts with the hope that the
show will be liked enough that the
search for the sister can last several
seasons.

Feminists may have mixed
feelings about Charlie’s Angels-
the angels being three women

99!. '
esp.

There are 11 dramatic shows in

this season’s line-up, all of which

have been seen before with different
faces.

Two good actors star in two new ’

shows of the cop-with-the-funny
ethnic name genre. Judd Hirsch
plays an almost-always angry
policeman in Delvecchio, and David
Birney, formerly of Bridget Loves
Bernie, takes over Al Pacino's movie
role as Serpico. " -

Unfortunately, good actors do not

_ always make for good programs each

week; bad writing sometimes screws
’em up, as Robert Blake (from
Baretta) might say.

The only Western of the new

Chekhov’s Spirit
Missed in Production

BY TOBI ROSEN

Uncle Vanya is a play I wanted to
like. Hell, George Anderson of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette strung a
long list of superlatives on it in last
week’s paper.

ldo not disagree so much with
his sentiments about the Chekhov-
ian drama as with the Pittsburgh
Public Theatre’s production of it.

The crucial problem lies with the
words. This production introduced
a new “Americanized” translation
by Michael Henry Heim. Chekov,
when translated from the mother-
tongue Russian usually is done in

“British” or Victorian English.
And for a good reason.

American words with their mono
sylables and concrete sounds do
not have ample space to capture
the subtle ambiguities and nuances
which propell Chekhov’s characters
into frenzied action.

His characters and themes are
timeless in their ability to
transcend universal concerns.
Chekhov shows both the feelings
and attitudes of people whose lives
have hit a dead end.

Vanya has worked his brother's
estate long and hard. Each month,

detectives who solve the cases and
catch the bad guys on their own. The
catch: They take their assignments
from a never seen man, Charlie.
Some television producers can only
take one step at a time, but at least
the women, Kate Jackson, Farrah
Fawcett-Majors, and Jaclyn Smith,
aren't billed as Charlie's secretar-
ies. ' A P '

If none of the commercial
network’s entries seem exciting,
remember there is always the Public
Broadcasting System which is
bringing back Hollywood Television
Theatre, Performance at Wolf Trap,
and will be presenting Ingmar
Bergman's Scenes From a Marri-
age, in its original form.

There are also successful movies
whch add to the network’s schedule.
Amongthem: Gone With The Wind,
2001: A Space Odyssey, and
Chinatown. Of course, if all else
fails, Mary Hartman, Mary Hart-
man, and NBC’s Saturday Night
have returned to get us thro ugh each
week.

‘COPE’ RETURNS TO
PITTSBURGH

“Don’t Bother Me, I Can’t
Cope,” which played to sold-out
houses in its Pittsburgh premiere
last season on Heinz Hall’s first
Broadway Theater Series, returns
here now to play two n0n~SerieS
shows, Monday and Tuesday, Oct.
18 and 19, both starting at 8 p.m.

This is the multiple-award-winm

Steely Dan Does It
Again In Top Form

BY GEORGE FAINES

The Royal Scam
Steely Dan
ABC Records ABCD 931

Steely Dan has done it again with
the release of the band’s latest

album, The Royal Scam. It is by far .

the band’s most consistently
satisfying record and a brilliant
improvement upon their previous
material. Steely Dan’s intelligent
style of rock-and-roll has matured
and The Royal Scam is full of
complex musical textures. ’ I
What makes Steely Dan so distinct
is fantastic songwriters, Walter
Becker and Donald Fagen. They
write lyrics and tell stories that most
novelists could not even compre-
hend. At times the lyrics are so full of

‘imagery and so pleasing to the ear

that they sound like poetry.

To guitarist Dennis Dias, Steely
Dan has added a host of extremely
capable studio musicians. Vic
F eldman’s keyboard work is a key to
the band’s sharp and unique sound.
Also worth mentioning is the
drumming of Bernand Purnie, which
gives Steely Dan a more driving and

energetic sound. As usual, Fagen’s —

vocals are highly impressive—al-
most as potent as Dylan’s.

The album’s opener, “Kid
Charlemagne, ” is a ﬁrst-rate rocker
that features a tight rhythm section
along with some strong back-up
vocals. It tells the amusing story of a
spaced-out California dope dealer
who is still lingering in the long-gone
days of Haight-Ashbury. Fagen’s
strict vocals ask him to take a good

The brains and
voice behind Steely Dan.

Donald Fagen:

look at himself and his obsolete
culture: -

“All those day-glow freaks
Who used to paint the face
They've joined the human race
Somethings will never change.”

On the title track, “The Royal
Scam,” Becker and Fagen create a
very grim mood that is drenched
with musical imagery. At ties the
gloomy piano andthe moaning horns
are so painful that they remind one of
a funeral march.

“The Royal Scam’s” message is
even more disturbing than its eerie

Country Cookin' o lo
Mrs. Restino Style

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Mrs. Restino’s Country Kitchen
Susan Restino

Quick Fox Publisher; 291 pages;
$7.95

With today’s food industry

shoveling additives, preservatives,

and other noxious ’-tives’ into
preserved preparations, it’ s refresh-
ing to know what you are eating.

Mrs. Restino’s Country Cooking
is a cookbook that gives townhouse
dwellers ataste of living off the land.
Yet it is more than a cookbook. It
takesthe reader from the wheat ﬁeld
to the dinner table by increments
exploring the content of the food as
well as just giving recipes.

“We try to get down to where we
know what we’re eating and know
it's not all mis-mashed up with insect
sprays and defoliants and purifiers
and dehydrators and preservatives
and artiﬁcial God-knows-what-all, ' ’
Restino writes.

To this end, Restino offers a
copious recipe, concentrating on
listing the biological and nutritional
aspects of food.

She delves at length into the use of
seasonal vegetables which can't be
bought at the A&P——cattail hearts, a
cooked-cross between grass stems
and asparagus, and japanese
knotweek—but can be found in
patches along roadsides and barns.

Restino fuels her recipes with
fresh picked grains and vegetables
from the nearby woodland or her
garden.

Nothing pre-packed, nothing
canned, country cooking requires
preparations which might discour-
age city-folk. She advocates
grinding the grain for homemade
bread and whole-wheat flour and
frowns upon white ﬂour.

A batch of bread made with
hand-ground flour takes two
afternoons to prepare, one ‘for
grinding and the other for baking. I
agree that “nothing compares to
homemade bread," but at ten to 12
hours per batch, bread-baking can't
‘be a spur of the moment affair.

Restino also elaborates on chicken
raising, cow milking, pasteurization
and woodstove cooking. Her
rendition of wood stove cooking

instrumentation. It takes a
frightening look at reality and
focuses on the greedy style of living
in America. The song endstwith a
letter that is found on a faraway
island. It tells how in America ‘ ‘they
are paid in gold just to babble in the
back room all night and waste the
time, and they wandered in...with-
out a dime.”

“The Fez” is a humorous little
number that is built on a very strange
Arabian sort of melody. Its simple
best and silly lyrics are quite a
contrast to the complexity of the
album as a whole.

From its opening guitar solo to its
ﬁnal fade out, “Don’t Take Me
Alive” is a real killer. Its intense
rhythm and harsh moral impact
surpass “Reelin’ In The Years” as
the ultimate Steely Dan song.
Becker and Fagen’s lyrics are
extremely graphic as they describe
the plight of a young fugitive and his
inner struggles with his conscience.
“Don’t Take Me Alive” is so
dramatic that it is more like a
Hollywood drama than just a mere
song.

When Steely Dan are in top form,
there are very few bands that can
touch them. They combine gutsy
rock-and-roll with creative lyrics
and, in turn, possess one of the most
distinct styles in popular music. The
Royal Scam is a must album for all
rock fans who are suffering from the
current shortage of quality record-
ings.

with his neice Sonia, he sends his

makes the simple life sound not so
simple. _

Despite her meticulous descrip-
tion of wood stove parts and
operation, Restino neglects to tell
the reader how to maintain a steady
temperature in a woodstove. Since
the oven temperature ﬂuctuates
with the intensity of the ﬂames, it’s
difficult to maintain a constant
temperature for regulated cooking.

In anticipation of Saturday's
contest at Pitt Stadium between the
Pitt Panthers ( .4-0) and Louisville,
a game expected by many to be a
“laugher," the weekly media
luncheon was filled with more than
the usual amount of oneliners.

The comedian, strangely, was
Louisville head coach Vince Gibson
who, with a team coming off a
dismal 1-10 season, would seem
more in place if he was crying
instead of cracking jokes.

As coach of once-lowly Kansas
State in the tough Big Eight
Conference, Gibson, via a tele-
phone hookup, related how he had
nightmares at the thought of
Nebraska or Oklahoma, whom Pitt
coach Johnny Majors also faced
while serving time at Iowa State.

Gibson was one of the ﬁrst
coaches Majors befriended in the
Big Eight. Asked if Majors has
changed any since ﬂeeing to
Pittsburgh to turn around a
struggling program here, Gibson

‘‘I know a lot of things on him,"

_Gibson said, reaching back for

humor to cover the ominous task he
and his Cardinals (2-1) have
Saturday. “And if he runs up that
score on me, I have some stamped
envelopes and letters ready and
I'm going to put them in the mail."

And when given his chance,
Majors struck back. “The first
thing I'd like to say is that I'm sorry
I spent so much time with Vince

g Gibson.’ '

But the serious purpose of the
luncheon also was fulfilled. Gibson
said he feels the game will be
highlighted by the battle between

-two of the nation's finest running

backs: Heisman Trophy candidate
Tony Dorsett of the Panthers and
Louisville's Calvin Prince, leading
scorer in the NCAA.

“Calvin Prince is potentially a
great back,” Gibson said. “He
doesn't have the offensive line that

most great backs have, but he's a '
‘junior and he has the potential of
‘being a really great back.

“And Tony Dorsett has got to be
one of the best backs I've ever

Eight, and, of course, 0. J.
Simpson, but Dorsett ranks right
up there with them as one of the
all-time best.”

Majors also was to praise, but
also realized the imperfections his
team has yet to iron out——too many
fumbles and illegal procedure
penalties and ﬂaws in returning
kicks.

“Our running game was decisiv-
ely improved,” Majors said. “Our
inside and outside games and our
passing all contributed toward a
good ballgame. The passing game
was probably the biggest thing.

Matt Cavanaugh (voted UPI to the
Backﬁeld of the week) by fairplayed
the‘ best ballgame for a quarterback
we’ve ever had.

“He showed great poise. He
was shaky against Temple because

it was his first start and didn't have___

_ seen.‘ I got to see Johnny Rodgers
quipped, “He's gotten a lot older.”

Number Two Panthers Merit
  More From Unranked Fans

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

When the fans of the number-two ranked team in the country are still
cheering as if in the 1-10 years, you kind of wonder what must be done to
draw their attention and support. But after that second bottle of rum and
the person of the opposite sex in front of you starts looking better with
every gulp, who cares if Dorsett takes a 90-yard trip--he's probably not
feeling as good.

After sitting in the stands for three years—being hassled by the frats
over their ‘ ‘reserved’ ’ seats, ducking empty rum bottles and moving the
guy next to me who has passed out in my lap-—I have found asylum in the
press box, where it isn't any quieter, but perhaps a little more sober.
Though the Panthers are in the midst of a battle for the national crown,
Seagram’s and Sangria seem to be getting more support from the Pitt
Students than Tony Dorsett and Elliott Walker.

Coach Johnny Majors, the Pitt players and the athletic department
would like to change that image. Not only would it erase the apathetic
mark branded on the Pitt students, but cheers of DEFENSE or WE WANT
A TOUCHDOWN can mean a lot to the team and help them to remain
undefeated and reach their goal of an NCAA title.

“It makes a lot of. difference when you have a vociferous crowd,”
Majors said. ‘ ‘Crowd reaction is deﬁnitely a factor. Ithink we play a lot
better before good crowds than if there are lackadaisical people in the
stands. It was really important in the Duke team’ s ability to come back last
week. They had afull house, which is really rare, pulling for them up until
the last two or three minutes of thegame.

“I look for more enthusiasm in our stands, ” heoontinued. ‘ ‘I'd like to
"see our supporters come out with the idea that Saturday is a fun day and a
festive day when there's no classes or no work-. I'd like to see the
bigcrowds again at Pitt Stadium and I hope it starts this Saturday.”

So the Pitt coaches, cheerleaders and band have devised a way to draw
that much-needed support. This week has been designated as “Spirit
Week? ’ with several activities planned to show that Pitt students also rank
at least number two, if not higher, in supp‘orting,THEIR team.

‘ ‘If the students know that this team is their team, we are going to be
more appealing to the students. Theyare the basic’ fans who love college '

~ football betterthan any other sport, but they have to become involved and
become part of it all.” _ .

The plan is this. At 6:30 p.m. Friday there will be a big pep rally in the
Quad with the players, coaches, cheerleaders and band on hand. All Pitt
fans attending the Louisville game on Saturday are asked to wear blue and
gold clothing. “I’d even wear blue and gold underwear if I thought it

« would do any good,” Majors joked. ~

The Panthers, when practicing, wear green jerseys on offense and red
on defense. The colors, of course, are alluding to GO and STOP,
respectively, the purpose of each unit. So, in addition to the pep rally and
the blue and gold clothing, red and green hankerchiefs will be distributed
before the game to be used in cheering. When the offense takes the field,
the fans should wave their green hankerchief, and when the defense runs
on, their red. The Pitt varsity marching band will play appropriate
arrangements for each unit.

Majors’ main hope is to use the home advantage to the fullest and make
Pitt Stadium as dreadful for an opposing team to visit as South Bend or
Columbus . In order to get the students cheering, perhaps something they
are not yet used to, the band will station trumpets in the stands and a
member from each fraternity will be invited to lead a cheer with the
microphone in an attempt to show the support that was missing against
Temple.

‘ ‘Iwas disappointedthey were so quiet, " Majors said. ‘ ‘When we play
Notre Dame, Penn State or West Virginia at home, we have great
enthusiasm and great excitement. But when we play someone not on the
schedule every year and there's no rivalry, the fans aren't as excited."

Let's embark on another MAJOR CHANGE and let's do it now.

Matt Cavanaugh, wo gives the Panthers another offensive

weapon with his accurate passing, talks over a tough situation with head
coach Johnny Majors. Cavanaugh was voted to the UPfBackﬂeld of the

Week for tossing ﬁve TD passes against Duke.

Haygood to come off the bench and
help him. But I think he put it. all
together against Duke.”

Majors’ biggest concern, as it
has been all season, is that the
Panthers don't get fat and
overconﬁdent now that the hardest
part of the schedule is over with.
But Miami (Fla.) is always tough
and Army also has unleashed one
of the nation's top serial attacks.
Rivalries like West Virginia and
Penn State cannot be taken" lightly
either. ’

“None of us can afford to get
satisﬁed," Majors said. “We still
have a lot to work for--even this
week. After the Duke game, the
defense was dissatisfied with
themselves and I think that's
healthy. I anticipate to keep
throwing the ball to give us
balance. A pleasing point (he taps

Wilson photo

the table twice) is that we’ve

thrown only one interception in

four games.”

Gibson is aware of Pitt's
new-found passing attack and
realizes the problem in stopping it,
along with the running of Dorsett
and Elliott Walker. S‘

“Duke said they were going to

slow down Dorsett and they did,"
Gibson said, “but they could not
stop the passes. Pittsburgh can
really make the big play on you
with all those skilled people."
I If the Panthers (ranked number
two in both the Associated Press
and United, Press International
polls) don't win big over Louisville,
as indeed they should (and impress
the writers and coaches who vote)
they could fall in the rankings, even
with a win, and then the joke will
really be on Pitt. .

  Booters Oar Gannon

BY JIM LEWIS

There’s no doubt that Leo Bemis
is at the helm of the Pitt soccer

team, but he doesn't exactly like,

the boat his squad is rowing.
“We're pretty much in the same

I boat as last year," coach Bemis

claimed. “We're struggling to get
goals again.” -

That annual frustration of
lacking offensive power has hit the
Panthers.
little, if any, scoring in a game.
Last year, it- was extremely
noticeable and cost a good team a
winning season. . V

This year, it's happening again.

In preparation for tonight's 7
o'clock matchup between Pitt and
Gannon at Pitt Stadium, Bemis has
been putting his crew through
shooting practice in hopes of better
goal production. _

Not that the Pitt forwards are
bad--they're talented and young for
a college starting line--it’s just that
Bemis is trying to improve
fundamentals for the future.

“We don't have good, strong,
experienced forwards.” Bemis
explained. ‘'50 every time we get a
chance, we'll have ‘to develop
shooting abilities of our players.
We're trying to upgrade the people
we have."

But now the bad news: Injuries
have plagued Pitt. (2-3-1) lately.
Back Erwin Siegel, and forwards
Mark Nigh and Rick Roccon are‘
very doubtful for tonight's contest.

Siegel, a sophomore, is a big loss
to the defense. which didn't play
well in the first half of the Temple
game last week (Pitt lost, 8-0).

"We don't expect him to play,"
Bemis said. “He'll miss the game.

Lately, there has. been _

V

We'll miss him.’ -

Meanwhile, Nigh (bruised knee)
and Roccon (bruised calf) are
questionable with nagging injuries.

Both may play, mostly because
together their two goals apiece are
two-thirds of the Pitt offensive
scoring total so far this season. If
both were to sit out, that would
leave Craig Connolly as the only
scorer on the team with two goals.

But Bemis isn’t ready to jump
into the lifeboat yet; he's sure his
team will make a good showing.

“We're going to be hurt some.
but we're going out to win," be

confirmed. “We just have to get
the guys to start putting it into the
goal.”

Which will be hard, for Gannon
has a strong team. Led by
center-forwards Brian Booth and
Agar Suzan, Gannon boasts a
powerful mid-ﬁeld and a quick
wing game, a set-up good enough
to crush St. Vincent Colle“g'e 8-0,
last week--the same St. Vincent
squad Pitt could only muster a 1-0
victory against.

But Bemis is confident.

“This is a game we need, to
win," he stated. “I think it will be
a very competitive match."

For once, the weather coop-

women's cross country teams from
Pitt, the University of Maryland

and Lock Haven traveled to face the

Penn State Lady Lions Oct. 3.
The team had competed prev-
iously in damp, cool climates, so

_ Sunday's warm weather and clear,

blue skies provided an incentive to
those participating in the meet.
Penn State, ranked as one of the
top five teams in the country, had
little trouble defeating a squad

- consisting of Pantherette, Mary-

land and Lock Haven runners.
Because they have such a large and
talented group of harriers, the Lady

Lions could afford to split the team
into two separate A and B
divisions.

Penn State's A and B [squads
both scored better than the visiting
group of runners, ﬁnishing with 29

and 34 points, respectively, to the. V

Becky Falck turned in the best
time among the non-Penn Staters
with a clocking of 18:35.

go with Falck's 6th. .

BYSTEVESYBERT

To a receiver, a quarterback who
can throw well--one along the caliber
of a Matt Cavanaugh--is a dream
-come true. That’s the case for the
Pitt Panthers’ outstanding junior
ﬂanker Willie Taylor.

As most armchair football experts
know, it takes apotent running game
to open up the passing attack, and
vice versa.

At Pitt, two of the ﬁnest running
backs in the country, Tony Dorsett
and Elliott Walker, have galloped
through secondaries consistently for
the last two seasons. Now the
Panthers also are beginning to
feature one of the ﬁnest corps of
receivers in the land in Taylor, tight

end Jim Corbett (an All-American ‘

candidate) and split end Gordon
Jones.

For Taylor, Cavanaugh throwing

the ball his way regularly would be

_great. But if he has to settle for
throwinga downﬁeld block on a
Dorsett scamper, he feels just as
rewarded.

‘ ‘Sure Ilike us to throw the ball, ’ ’
Taylor said, ‘ ‘ but it’ s taking a chance
and with two great backs, there’s no
need to take chances. I’drather have
the ball thrown to me but when you
make a great block, you still feel
good."

Undoubtedly, Taylor is more
useful as areceiver. For the past two
years, he has been a ﬁxture at
ﬂanker. After spending his
freshman year with the JV squad,
leading the young Cats to a 4-0
record by catching 25 passes for 439

 

yards and ﬁve touchdowns, Taylor
moved up to the varsity in 1975 and
caught two aerials for 55 yards,
including a 41-yarder against
William and Mary, considered by
many the best catch ever at Pitt
Stadium.

Matt Cavanaugh was the Quarter-

-=back during Taylor’s JV career and
joining him on the varsity is a real
blessing for both players.
"In Cavanaugh’s record-breaking
performance last Saturday against
,the Duke Blue Devils, when he
passed for 339 yards, completing 14
of l 7, for ﬁve TD’ 5, Taylor was on the
receiving end of two of the scoring
tosses, one a 66-yarder, Pitt’s
longest of the season, to tie the game
in the opening quarter.

So far this season, he has grabbed ,
seven passes for 158 yards and has ’
received many words of praise from s

his teammates and coaches.

‘ ‘ Willie can be good as he wants to 5

said. ‘ ’He has the makings of a ﬁne
receiver with that inate ability he

his potential and has to work on some .

of the little things.”
Said Cavanaugh, who feels Tayloi

will grab just about anything he,

launches his way, “Willie runs his
patterns very well and is an excellent
downﬁeld blocker. And he’ll go
along with anything that is good for
the team."

The team and not Willie Taylor, is
the ﬁrst thing in Taylor’s mind.

“We’ve got to play as ateam, ” he
said. “I like to catch the ball, but I
want to win the game ﬁrst and do
whatever it takes."

Also avaluable asset as a punt and
kick—off returner, Taylor isn’t one for
looking ahead. His main concern is
that the 4-0 Panthers keep winning.
"‘We’ve got to keep playing them
one at a time," he said.

With Pitt unleashing a devas-
tating aerial attack to go with its
potent running, Taylor will be a
major factor in the Panthers’ drive
towards a national crown.

“Stud” Hard A t Work ,

BY DAVE McDONALD

Every year track coaches spend
hundreds of dollars and travel
hundreds of miles to recruit the
best in track and ﬁeld talent. Some

icoaches even go to extremes like

recruiting in Ireland, England and
Africa.

Often, though, good talent is
overlooked right in their own
backyards. ‘But this isn’t the case
with head track and cross country
coach Mike Agostinella. He
doesn’t cut through the ‘African
bush or hike over the Britain
countryside. In the case of
recruiting Mark Studnicki he just

Studnicki is certainly one of the
hard workers on the team. He
moved up from the junior varsity

Montreal W:1I1i'ep‘e’at As

NHL Opens New Season

BY STEVE SYBERT

With the National Hockey
League season already underway
and baseball not yet done and
football not even halfway through,
there seems to be no end to the
continuous cycle of sports.

But start the NHL has and this
season, the league’s 59th, should
be one of questions and uncertainty
with more close divisional races
than in recent years. The team to
beat, of course, is Montreal, which
completely devastated the two-time
champion Philadelphia Flyers in
last season’s Stanley Cup ﬁnals.

NORRIS DIVISION--Montreal is
a cinch, as indeed it also may be for
another Cup. After winning 58
games last season (an NHL record)
there's no end in sight for Guy
Laﬂeur (the league's leading scorer
with 56 goals and 69 assists), Peter
Mahovlich and Vezina Trophy
winner Ken Dryden (2.03 average).

The team which actually out-
scored the Canadiens by two goals
(339-337), the Pittsburgh Penguins
own one of the league's most
potent offenses, headed by 50-goal
scorers Pierre Larouche and Jean
Pronovost.

The Los Angeles Kings will give
Pittsburgh 2. race for second place.
Center Marcel Dionne (40-54-94) is

the key out on the coast, but the

Kings were hurt by the loss of
Terry Harper and Dan Maloney in
compensation to the Red Wings.

Once powerful in the Gordie
Howe days, Detroit faces still
another year struggling to rebuild a
team which has ﬁnished out of the
money for more years than it cares
to remember.

After winning only 19 of 160
games in their first two years, the
Washington Capitals can only get
better, and should, with defense-
man Rick Green, the NHL’s top
selection in the amateur draft,
being counted on to reduce the
Caps’ 394 goals allowed.

ADAMS DIVISION-—What did)

the Phil Exposito, trade and the
injury to Bobby Orr do to the
Boston Bruins, who won the
division over Buffalo and advanced
to the playoff semiﬁnals? Nothing.
And with former New Yorkers Jean
Ratelle and Brad Park, along with
what should be a sizeable
compensation for Orr from Chica-
go, the Bruins are revamped and
will again be tough.

Toronto, which has been empha-

sizing youth, may pull into second‘

place unless Buffalo can come up
with more than their four-man
team of the “French Connection”
(Rick ‘Martin, Gil -Perreault and

Rene Robert) plus"Danny Gare, ag

50-goal scorer. _
The California Seals are now the
Cleveland Barons and set to start

anew where they most likely won’t \

draw either unless the Browns and
Cavaliers alsohave dismal seasons.

PATRICK DIVISION--For the
first time in several years, there
should be ,a race for the
Philadelphia Flyers, who will be up
against the always pesty New York
Islanders. _

After being humiliated by
Montreal and suffering key injuries
to Bernie Parent, Bobby Clarke and
Rick MacLeish, the Flyers hopes
may now rest on Reggie Leach,
who caught ﬁre last season for 61

goals and a record 19 in the
playoffs.
Norris Trophy winner Denis

Potvin ﬁnished second to Clarke for
the MVP award and is the leader of
the contending Islanders.

If Esposito and Hodge can
duplicate their Bruin glory years in
New York, the Rangers will
improve after suffering through
their worst season ever and a
last-place ﬁnish.

Atlanta, which ﬁnished third last
year, could do it again, but not if
the Rangers capture any of their
previous form.

SMYTHE DIVISION--The lucky
Chicago Black Hawks, after losing
star Bobby Hull to the World
Hockey Association four years ago,
now have Bobby Orr and his $3
million contract. Tony Esposito is
still one of the NHL’s top goalies,
but the rest of the team suffered a
general collapse last season.

Under the leadership of new
G.M. “Cat" Francis, the St. Louis
Blues are working with youth as
and, as someone has said, the
“Cat" will have to use all nine lives
to survive the job.

Vancouver and Minnesota are
still floundering, though the
Canucks did sneak into the
playoffs. The North Stars are
searching for some offense after
recording the second lowest total in
the league last season.

Though ﬁnally in a hockey town,
Denver, the Colorado Roclties,
need the Kansas City Scouts, still
have a long way to go after winning
only 27 games in their prior home.

PA—A GREAT PLACE TO
RAISE RABBITS

NEW STANTON, Pa. (AP)-
‘Volkswagen’s multimillion dollar
plan to broaden a shrinking share of
the U.S. small car market was
brought home to an idle auto plant in
southwestern Pennsylvania yester-
day.

Chairman Toni Schmuecker ac-
cepted the keys to a vacant Chrysler
Corp. assembly plant in Westmore-
land County from Gov. Milton
Shapp, saying his firm hopes to
compete proﬁtably against Ameri-
can automakers on their own turf.

“We are entering the largest
single car market in the world and
competing with the threelargest and
most able car producers that exist, ’ ’
he said. “It is not going to be easy,
but we are conﬁdent ofour success. ’ ’

Volkswagen will invest up to $250
million over the next five years to
regain control of the ﬁve per cent of
the American small car market it
enjoyed until recently.

The New Stanton plant will begin
producing Volkswagen’s Rabbit
model in the spring of 1978.
Company officials expect annual
output to reach 200,000 cars three
years later.

“lthink you will find this is a great
place to raise Rabbits,” Shapp told
VW executives at the plant site.
“I’m certain your company will
proﬁt along with Pennsylvania in
your operation here.”

Volkswagen's entry in the U.S.
auto assembly industry will bring
Detroit’s foreigh competition vir-
tually to its doorstep. Schmuecker
said Volkswagen's may open U.S.
production ofﬁces in Detroit. 5

' “I think it is obvious that for a
period of time we will be where the
real business is, thus the possibility
of the Detroit area.” Schmuecker
said.
