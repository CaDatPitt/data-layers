Nyden’s Apparent Acceptance of
 l5-Month Contract is invalidated

By CRISTOPHER C.I-IOEL

Former assistant sociology
professor Paul J. Nyden’s “un-
der-protest” acceptance of a
special 15-month contract of-

fered by Chancellor Wesley W. A

Posvar after Nyden’s year-long
battled against the termination
of his original appointment was
invalidated by Posvar yester-
day.

Nyden’s attorney later said
Pitt’s move would lead his client
to a “fairly quick” entrance of
the case into court.

In a registered 0 letter sent to
Nyden and his attorney, James H.
Logan,. Posvar “advised (Nyden)

I that his contractual term as a faculty

member at the University of
Pittsburgh expired April 30, 1977, ”
according to Pitt’s news and
publications department.

Pitt Director of Legal Services
William Hannan, said i he‘- was
consulted by Posvar’s office in its
attempt to determine whether
Nyden’s May 26 letter, a seven-
page listing of his disagreements
with the Chancellor's proposal of
May 12, constituted a legal
acceptance of the offer.

“Legally.” Hannan told the Pitt
News last night, “It was not an
acceptance. What kept it from
being an acceptance were the
qualifications‘...the ifs, the ands,
the buts and everything else.

“With seven pages of protesta-
tions,” Hannan concluded, “it

Non—Faculty

Get Minimum

Salary Hike

Next year’s budget includes

$600,000 to_upgrade salary mini-

mums for all full-time non-faculty
staff positions.

At a recent Staff Advisory Board
Meeting, co-director of personnel
Nancy Gilkes said the program,
which hopefully will raise the
minimum monthly salary to $425,
should begin by October.

In the near future, Gilkes said,
the University senior «staff will be
considering new pay scales with
minimum entry rates from $425 to
$500 per month.

The new scales “are designed to
make the University more competi-
tive with area businesses,” Gilkes
said.

Of the 3,000 staff members at
Pitt, as many as 3,000 may beneﬁt

' from the increased income.

Gilkes said no average compen-
sation for staff has been computed.
The $600,000 may be for ﬂat raises
or for salary compensation and
increased fringe beneﬁts.

Gilkes indicated the increases
will be the first of a multi-stage
program. A

PAUL NYDEN

Dealt another setback

could‘ hardly be considered an
acceptance. ’ ’ '

Pitt’s statement said Nyden’s
“seven pages‘ of conditions, re-
quests and objections...sought to
qualify or change the terms of the
offer” and “did not constitute an
acceptance of the offer made May
12.”

Hannan said Nyden’s next step
would be toward court, “unless
they sit down and decide they don’t
have a case that would stand up.

‘ ‘If they don’t go to court, there’s
no place left to go,” Hannan said.
“It’s the only alternative they have
now.”

Logan, who is working on
Nyden’s case with New York
attorney Leonard Boudin, said his
client is vacationing in the Carolinas
and has not been made aware of
Posvar’s decision.’ he also
questioned the substance of Pos-
var’s letter, and its acquisition by
the news media.

 

“This is just a ﬂagrant violation
of the entire grievance procedure at
the University of Pittsburgh,”
Logan said. ‘ ‘It is not at all keeping
with the decision of the hearing
board (a seven-member faculty
panel appointed by Posvar that
originally recommended Nyden be
given a.three-year contract but later
endorsed the 15-month proposal).

‘ ‘We can’t do anything until Paul

gets back and we have a lengthy 

discussion,” Logan said, “but I
assume we will be in court. It’ll be
fairly quick, but the only speciﬁcs I

SGB Hears Budget Appeals

By BETSY NORMAN

A new method of categorizing
student organizations and a re-
structuring of ‘the Programming
and Lecture Committees of the
Student Government Board are two
changes in the annual Allocations
process begun last month.

This year SGB split all the
student organization into four
categories which reflected the

purpose and “program of the
organizations. A ﬁfth category
operational costs, was up to

provide money for the operating
expenditures of all the student
groups. Each category received a
percentage of the total $289,000
collected from student activities
fees. A

“This is the first year such
categories were used,” SGB
member Dave Hesidence said.
“They were set up to give the
Allocations Committee guidelines
to follow. Last year the only
guidelines were that percent of the

Fiddlers on the Student Union patio set the mood for the outdoor cafe yester-

day.

money was, programming and 20
percent for operational costs. A The
Allocations Committee needs
guidelines than that."

The largest category was ser-
vices, which received 61 percent of
the total amount. SGB and its eight
standing committees, the Black
Action Society, the Resident
Student Organization, the Intra-
fraternity Council and the Panhel-
lenic Council are included in this
category.

Athletic and recreational or-
ganizations were appropriated four

percent to fund organizations such .

as the Hockey Club, the Riﬂe Club,
the Aquettes and the Ski Club.
The media and publication
category was allocated 12.5 per-
cent. This category includes the

Pitt.vNews, which receives eight

percent under contract, The Owl,-

Backspace. WPGH. Pitt Capsule
and Eureka. 0

Of the student groups, the two
programming committees will re-
ceive the most money, according to
Allocations Committee member
Joe Mclntyre.

Other groups that will receive .

over $10,000 are

SGB and the Pitt
News. ' '

A total of $15,000 was set aside
for remunerations.

Any money that is ‘not allocated
‘to student group-s will be placed in
a general account to be used for
emergency requests.

Assembly Meets;

By DEANNA LOUISE

Representatives from 21 of 117
recognized student organizations
approved by-laws for the Student
Government Assembly at its first
meeting last week.

Acting Chairman and Student
Government Board member Chip
Hubbard said, “The board agreed
the attendance and interest were
good, considering the time the
meeting was held.” The assembly,
an advisory body to the SGB, met
last Thursday at 2 p.m. in the
Student Union Lower Lounge.

Last month SGB froze the
budgets of 59 student organiza--
tions, when appeals to these groups
for names of representatives to the
assembly fell on deaf ears.

Although the Allocations Com-
mittee has prepared budget rec-
ommendations for all eligible
student organizations, the SGB has
a “constitutional right,” Hubbard
said, to decline vote on such ﬁgures
until representatives are appointed.

Budget Freeze Still On

“The freeze shouldn’t restrict
many groups because most money
transactions take place in the fall
and winter when activity increases.

“In September. the crunch will
hurt,” Hubbard said.

At that time, Hubbard said, the
board will renew its drive for
representatives. Memorandums of
the meetings and solicitations for
issues to be put on the agenda also
will be sent to eligible organiza-
tions.

At Thursday's meeting, the
assembly reviewed its proposed
by-laws and suggested a few
amendments to clarify them.

The by-laws also establish a
council of the assembly consisting
of the assembly representatives of
the Engineering Student Cabinet,
Black Action Society, Resident
Student Association, Interfraternity
Council, Panhellenic Association,
Nursing Student Organization and
the Association of Undergraduates
in Education.
