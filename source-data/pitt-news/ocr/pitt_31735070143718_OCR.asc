week, Sen. John McCain has made progress in the polls, taking a small lead over Sen. Barack Obama. The Pitt News Election
Focus Group sat down this week to discuss the recent support for the Republicans and Palin’s addition to the party ticket.

—-PresidentBush, Sept 11,2006

Today, Democratic presidential
candidate Sen. Barack _Obama and
his Republican counterpart Sen.
john McCain will visit Ground

_ Zero together‘ to commemorate-
; the seventh, anniversary of the
M Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. '

, The senators ' issued a. joint

-; statement last Saturday saying, ac- H
j cording to the Washington Post,
 “All ofrus came  on'9/V11‘ A
I, the "attacks, whenthe media, deter-

1 — not as Democrats or Republi-

 put aside politics and come togeth-
: er to renew that unity, tohonor the

tcanwhodiedandtogrievewith

; the families and ﬁiends who lost

; loved ones.”

It’s a strong gesture. The divi-

, our differences rriore than our

= similarities.

So "we applaud the two candi-

, dates for setting aside their differ-
 ences and remembering the lives

3 lost;
A However, the past seven years
; have been rampant with efforts at
politicizing this tragedy. We hope
T that this does not happen today
Sept. 11, 2001, was a cata-
strophic moment in our nation’s
history. The atmosphere in the
immediate aftermath was one of
i unity and patriotism. Flags deco-

: rated the windows and lawns of I

in millions of Americans, and the
A country was bound together in a

.p revivingdisplay of strength. .
‘ Butin the months and years that ~

_ followed, Americans witnessed the
. exploitation of this tragic ‘event by

politicians, using it to pass uncon-
; stitutional legislationvthat has dam-

aged our civil liberties and to push
the country into an unnecessary
war in Iraq. Soon the atmosphere
of unity turned into an environ-
ment of fear, further exploited by
politicians and the media. I _

We saw this in the former Re-
publican mayor -:'of New York,
Rudy Giuliani. The Sept. 11 at-
tacks were a central part of Giu-

 campaign for president. At a A t
 stop in New Hampshire .

in,2007,— Giuliani said, according to.

. the Washington Post, “If a Demo?

crat is elected president -in 2008,
America will be at risk for another
terrorist attack on the scale of
Sept. 11, 2001.” '

i We saw it in -the months after

mined to ﬁll the chatter of 24-hour
cable news networks, showed the
jarring footage of the falling twin
towers over and over 

- On. SCPK 20, 2001, Bush ad-
dressed the nation and said of the
terrorists behind the attack, “They
hate our freedoms ——- our freedom
of religion, our freedom of speech,

‘our freedom to vote and assemble

and disagree with each other.”

America bought this as the mo-
tivation behind the terrorists’ ac-
tions, and the media failed to give
the fearful public a more realistic,
scrutinized explanation.

Today, many Americans are
still scared. They have lost hope in
their political leaders. Inthe midst

‘ of a seemingly endless war, the

country is divided. But Obama
and McCain have the opportunity
to alleviate the fear, hopelessness
and division today.

Both candidates speak repeat-
edly of change, but we also need‘
to see a changein the dishonorable

_way Sept. 11- has been handled by

politicians. We hope to hear more

than empty rhetoric today and see a _ .

genuine effort at unity. Only when
we learn to set aside our partisan
politics — even with fewer than 60
days left until the election ——- can

Pundits are quick to point out

ii the housing bubble as a brilliant
 example of the private sector
 failing. Isthis a reasonable narra-
 tive? . M I

  The private sector fails  the
 time. General Motors was tool-
 ing plants to build . SUVs while

 modest, affordable shelters. Andi

‘? middle schoolers were learning

that we’re running out of I, oil. A
studio spent $175rnill_ion to make
“Waterworld.” Someone spent $6

to see “Waterworld.” ’ .

—However,, it’s rare for the
private sector to foster-an' inex-
cusable, colossal failurelike the
housing bubble without some

help from the government. Con- '

sider this: There was a blog called
‘The Housing’ Bubble_ Blog,”
chronicling the housing bubble
while the it was going on, and

people kept investing in housing. "

Now, consider just how much‘ the
government does to make people
invest in housing: ’ a

First, there are deductions for
housing. The government lets
you deduct the interest on your
mortgage from your income tax-
es. Is this a good way to help poor
people own homes? Not really,
given that the deduction applies
to mortgages of up to $1 million.

The deduction subsidizes big-

ger and pricier houses more than

for that, it costs the government

$75 billion a year — three times

our infamous farm subsidies. ,
Likewise, the government lets
you deduct property taxes —
meaning the more expensive your
property is and the more likely
you live in a high-tax bubble zone
like New Jersey, the bigger your

, deduction. Culturally, these sub-
. sidies fostered the fantasy that

money spent on housing isn’t
money spent at all. And both are
part of the fantasy in Republican
culture that anything that results

 in the government raising less
we be a nation that is fully healed. j

money is equivalent to smaller

Second, the government

their debt guaranteed,,they could

tried to introduce some sobriety

into the free-lunch ethos of these
hijinks by creating a Treasury De-
partment agency to regulate the
shareholders gambling with gov-

ernment money. But Democratic ’

Sen. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a
self-described Democratic so-
cialist, complained, ‘‘These two
entities —— Fannie Mae and Fred-
die Mac — are not facing any
kind of crisis.” The saga ended
with little oversight and a huge
bailout — at worst, $200 billion,
more than $600 per.American.

The more interesting question,
though, runs, “Why does . our
government encourage housing
so much?” A subsidy should at

least have paternalism or social

virtue to defend it.

If housing investment is so
smart, why do we need a subsidy
—— i.e. why do people that don’t
 it have to pay higher taxes?

uperstition

We might say the government is A

smarter than us and should nudge

us toward home ownership. But ' ~

is buying a house actually smarter
than renting an apartment? We

usually say so, because one day A

you’ll own the house. But what if
I rent a modest apartment and in-
vest heavilyin the stock market?
My stocks will grow more than
10 percent per year — double
every seven years — in the long
term, while my house’s value will
normally just keep place with in-
ﬂation. I know I’ll feel safer with
a giant, diversiﬁed portfolio than
a smaller, single asset, the value
of which might depend most on
my school board. Besides, if gov-
ernment cares so much about its
citizens’ ﬁnancial future, it should

nix the deductions and bailouts ’

and then devote those billions to
cutting tax rates or paying down
government debt. ‘

’ Socially, thecase for housing
subsidies fairs even worse. We’re
encouraging sprawl and discour-
aging dynamic, idea-producing
rental communities. . Subsidized
McMansions usemore energy to

heat and cool than apartments, 1

where your neighbor’s radiation

can heat your home and you’re‘

insulated on ﬁve sides and where ’

you can walk to the grocery store. i
I Home ownership causes unem-

ployment, as laid-off workers

struggle to sell off all the houses ‘

in a neighborhood before they
can move away to better jobs. In
contrast, in my apartment, for ex-
ample, my savings would ﬂow to-
ward job-creating, life-enhancing

investments like industrial equip— V
ment, infrastructure and drugde-i

sign.

Housing policy runs on a su-
perstition that housing is some-
how more worthy than other uses

for our savings. That policy, in ,

turn, justiﬁes that superstition.
It’s time to stop indulging super-
stitions. It’s time that everyone
follow what  say.

Thee 50s  Teens is bound to
draw a diverse crowd.

And Tuesdays show at H0wler’s
Coyote Cafe in Bloomﬁeld was no

exception —— indie kids, anirne fans
and "many others stood shoulder to
shoulder representing a perfect cross-
section of the Pittsburgh alternative
community.

Thee 505 High Teens, an all—girl
Japanese punk band featuring Tomo
(lead vocals/bass), Sue (drums/Vo-

cals), Nami (guitar/vocals) and Yocci
(keyboard/vocals), visited Pittsburgh
on Tuesday to promote the recent US.
release of its 2004 album, Punt/7 De
Beat. Tomo founded the band more
than 10 years ago in the Fukuoka pre-
fecture of Japan, and it’s still playing
its unique garage—screampunk blend.

The band has attained a large amount
of indie popularity in japan and has
toured Europe, but this is its ﬁrst foray

1 “A fair number of the people that
we show here have no connection to
Pittsburgh,” he said. “So Pittsburgh is
not an extremely common theme”

Tohara’s “Pittscapes,” which will
_be available for public  from
Sept 5 to Nov 7, 2008, is just another
set of prints on the librarys walls, but
through his unusual choices of sul}
jects and viewpoints, Tohara is 
to bring something new to the table

“You will recognize parts of the
city, but that’s not what he’s  for,”
said Silverman. ‘ ‘These are not the type
of photos you would see in a textbook
or guidebook to Pittsburgh.”

Though Tohara -is not a native to
the city, he could definitely be con-
sidered a resident According to his

In general, we tend to sectional-
ize our lives based on major events
that we expenence These life—alter:ing
moments include our births, getting a
drivers license, the first time we had
sex, the ﬁrst time we had good sex,
marriage, kids, the first time we saw a
My Morning Jacket concert and then
death.

What you ask, is with that second
to last one? And what the heck is a
morning jacket?

The answers to your questions
are, respectively, the best live show
(except for Radiohead and an as—
sortrnent of Grateful Dead—related
bands, arguably) in the world today
and the band that plays said show

This band sounds like a big deal,
right? Well, it is. And it utterly and
completely rocked my world last Fri-
day night My knees are still shaking.

First, some background: My
Morning Jacket is a quintet from
Louisville, Ky. The band’s first three
albums, including the superb It 525/!
Mover, sounded like an arnped—up,
tiippy version of The Allman Broth-
ers on way more hallucinogenic
drugs Then came 2005’s Z, which
took the whole shebang and made it
sound like The Allman Brothers play-
ing a carnival on Mars. Then l\/ﬂvlj
dropped E2/17 Urges this summer and
blew up the whole sound —.— the re-
cord rocks like Prince fronting a band
of groovy space aliens with a wicked
librarian fetish (check the tune “Li-
brarian”).

Now a lot (note: A LOT) has
been made about the band’s live
show, namely this summer’s mon-
strous three-hour—plus set at Bonna—
roo. So it’s an understatement to say

that I was excited when my girliiiend

spotted that they’d be playing in Phil— 1

Women's Basketball

Big East foes highlight

tough Women's schedule

by Zack Chakan
/1.t.1[..vtzz/zt Spa/‘[21 Editor T’

The Pitt women’s basketball team resumes
its quest to return to the Sweet 16 Nov. 5, as its
2008—09 schedule was announced Monday.

Coach Agnus Berenato’s squad won its
first two NCAA tournament games in the
franchise’s history last season, befoie falling to
Stanford in the round of 16, 72-53.

The Panthers ﬁnished last season with a
24-11 record, going 10-6 in the Big East That
score tied for fifth in the conference.

Pitt begins the season Nov. 5 in an exhibi-
tion contest against the Ohio Legends at the
Petersen Events Center. Another exhibition
game, against the Premier Players, arrives in
Pittsburgh Nov. 11.

The real meat of the schedule begins Nov.

16, in Baton Rouge, La. Pitt will square off-

against Texas A&M, a possible preseason top-
10 candidate, in the State Farm Tipoff Classic.

Pitfs non—conference schedule features a
few high-proﬁle teams. Maryland, which also

lost to Stanford in last year’s NCAA tourna— I

ment, visits the Petersen Events Center Dec 7.
That loss was in the Spokane regional final, and
the Terrapins could be a top—10 club as well.
Cross—state rival Penn State also travels to
Pittsburgh this year. Pitt’s first defeat last year

   

‘came at the hands of the Nittany Lions, and
look to exact revenge Nov. 24.

The Panthers will head to Gainesville, Fla.
to take on Flonda Dec 21.

The Petersen Events Center will host the
Pitt Thanksgiving Tournament Nov. 28-29.
Pitt will play E1011 and either‘ Weber State or
Youngstown State. ‘ »

Pitt’s powerful Big East schedule opens
Jan. 4, at home against nval West  The
Mountaineers are the only conference oppo-
nent the Panthers play twice, both home and

‘ away. The road contest is set for Feb. 24.

Pitt’s toughest portion of the season arrives
with February.

Notre Dame," which finished last year‘

ranked No. 13, visits Pittsburgh Feb. 3. Then,
the Panthers must go on the road to face the
Big East’s perennial powerhouses Rutgers and
Connecticut. .

The Rutgers game will be played Feb. 10,
while the Connecticut showdown takes place
Feb. 15.

The Big East Championship in Hartford,
Conn., begins March 6 and runs through
March 10. NCAA tournament play opens
March 21.

Rens’ system catching on,

but Panthers fall to Dukes

Volleyball, page 16

Rens said the tournament games were
no excuse for losing to Duquesne, which
also played in a tournament in Baltimore the
same weekend.

Pitt was caught on its heels early in the
match, after the Dukes jumped out to an
early 12-3 lead in the ﬁrst game. Duquesne
never trailed in the game and cruised to a 25-
17 win to go up 1-0.

The second game proved to be a tough,
even tilt with neither team stretching past a
four-point differential. With the Dukes lead-
ing 23-20, senior Jessica Moses did her best
to keep the Panthers close late in the game.
She scored three of the Panthers last four
points with two kills and a. block. But the
Dukes hung with the Panthers and rallied af-
ter a timeout to win a close game, 26-24.

Facing a 0-2 deﬁcit coming out of half-
time, the Panthers ﬁnally showed signs of life
against the Dukes, jumping out to an early
8-2 lead. The Panthers never let their lead
drop below six points in the game. Dooley
notched six kills for Pitt, and'the team owned

a .333 attack percentage. It used that and ﬁve .

team blocks to dominate game three and
cruise to a 25-10 win.

In game four, Duquesne jumped out to
an early 3-0 lead and held the lead until the
Panthers tied the score at nine. ' ,

But a kill off of Moses put the Dukes on
top for good. They went on a 10-2 run and
never looked back as they captured the 25-19
game victory and the 3-1 match victory.

Dooley and Campbell led the Panthers

3 with 17 and 14 kills, respectively. Carnpbell

added 13 digs, who, along with Rossi’s 22
digs, continued to adjust to the new defen-
sive system. , .
“Both teams played good defense,” said
Rens. “We had 68 digs as a team.” ‘
* Moses led the Panthers in attack percent-

-age with a .235 percentage, and freshman

Allyson Hodnik had a career-high 45 assists.
Ten service errors by the Panthers, compared
to just two by the Dukes, gave Duquesne
easy points andiprevented Pitt from building
up any scoring momentum. _

“We knew coming in that Duquesne
doesn’t really make a lot of mistakes,” said
Rens.  ,

“We also kind of got caught up playing
[Duquesne’s] system. Their system is slower
and more deliberate. We like to play fast.”

The Panthers lost the match but still led

the Dukes in total team blocks (13-8), attack I

percentage (.147—.128), kills (49-47)‘ and as-
sists (46-44). ’ I

Rens hopes his team continues to improve if

under his new system and hopes to make Pitt
into an NCAA tournament regular.

' “I think it’s a process for everyone in-
volved,” said Rens of the system change.
“I continue to learn more and more about
my players, and they do about me. I love the
openness and how they’ve embraced change

and a new idea and a new system. The team '

really fights, and sooner or later we’re going

i to turn that corner and qualify for the NCAA

tournament.”

- Michael Heater /mPihoto Edit
Pitt's Nicole Taurence (9) and Meagan Dooley (15) reach to deflect a potential spike
against Ohio in the Pitt Classic. The Panthers travel to Los Angeles this weekend.
