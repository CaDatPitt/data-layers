_ The lives of great men were made famous because they. did things. The

men were able to defeat the-British forces because he acted when he saw his
opportunity. He crossed thericy Potomac one night and -struck. the enemy
at, the “proper time to defeat him. Vlfhe had delayed crossing, he would have

to act? A Begin today to do the work you have been puttingoff until tomor-

date. Let us not be like many who have gone before usthat intended ‘to
accomplish something‘ worth while but delayed the beginning so long that

moments roll by instead of existing today and expecting, to live tomorrow.

’ Marcus Aaron, president ‘ of . the

_,Pittsburgh‘ Board of Public Education,

spoke-brieﬂy ofthe needs of -develoIl-

' ment‘ of higher education facilities

in the city, whereby‘ students might
not be compelled‘ to go to other.emi-
nent universities-__ in the country.
Rather, l1e_expressed the "hope, the

-local University, would be a’ magnet
" to draw .from other ‘sections.

Among those at the speakerls table
were R. _B._Mel1on, Harrison, Nesbit,

- or thinking, a.‘ way of doing,‘ a._ spirit:
here out of which has come the v
wealth, the‘ manufacturing, and the‘

, tonnage'_pro_duction.  . 

’,"This spiritfis little known.’ It-was

broughbhere by the pioneers. Then‘

it grew under‘ pioneer conditiolis until

‘ it" became an’ outstanding quality in

the entire district; never a’ thing to

—be grasped, but an atniosphere to -be
"breathed. It-is abspirit of -courage,
of daring, of “speed, of action, and of
honor, fall-gin large proportions won-'

derfully "combined. Let us ‘call’ pit“-a
spirit «of achievement.’ This spirit to
‘a large extent is unreve_ale'd to: the

_-world outside. ' '

. .

“The new a building is to“ express
this spirit of achievement with such

{force and with such grasp of its sub-
‘ limit? that. the whole world'will uu-'

derstand. _It is to be the greatest
structure ever erected by any com-
munity to tell its own living will. The
building is to be high not for the sake
of being high, but for the power of
inspiration and for the sub'1imit:v

which _.g're"at.... height together with‘

right proportion’s,, ‘mass, _l'rne's, carv-
ings, friezes. and “ pointed ,Goth’i'c

the effort of those ‘who made Pitts-
burgh’ what it is and to inspire‘ to
still ‘higher achievement those who
are‘ to '-come. ‘

"The building ‘it to be a cathedral
~ of learning, ~'a great central symbol,
, which makes the heart leap up and
_ understand Pittsburgh. ‘It is to tell

with unforgetable‘ clearness the in-
herent hope .- of the -men and women
of Pittsburgh. The structure, will not
be an imitation of’ anything, but

rather an original and adequate ex-‘

pression of local character, local his-
torical memory, and local aspiration.
,“The record of the pioneers has

 'already'become tradition. It is being

forgotten. Itconsists now chieﬂy of

l , names and dates ol1'tombst'ones, The"

great structurewill tell their story
with clarityand beauty. it will tell

their story by its lift and form, by its '

purpose, by its ﬁne paintings‘ hung
here and there on its walls, by its

..friezes decorating the study rooms,
by memorial-lecture rooms, memorial?
laboratories‘ and memorial libraries.‘
_—In a, word, thebuilding -and its con-
ftent's will keep vivid the lives of

those who have done good workfor
Pittsburgh.’ 'who,‘~to some memorable
degree,have produced music, for ex-
ample, or «built up industry, or ex-
tended our knowledge of truth, or in-
terpreted theuse. and beauty oflife,
or served‘ in_ matters of government.

.The'c'a.-thedral of inspiration will be

our expression of an everlasting
thanksgiving to those who have serv-
ed Pittsburgh ‘and to those, who, as

has been at work reshaping the face of
the earth since. the first mountains
were bul_l_t.. =‘. V I 1. ' , ;

It is the younger moumam systems,

geologically speaking, which are most
subject to these rock avalanches. Thus
the .1-;{im_alayas, which represent but
infant industries,‘ though lusty ones, in
the mountain“ building line, have a.
way, like other youngsters of ‘irnma--
ture charact-er,— of tumbling about in 8.1
Wholesale fashion which would result
in great catastrophes‘ were their
elopes and valleys populated to any
great extent. 5 V: W . '
' Sir William Conway describes the
matter .of .a little. shifting. of rock
which caused the formation-of Gohna
lake, in the central Himalayas, where,
the spur of a large lmolintfaln mass
pitched bodily into the valley below.
The front of the mountain had been
undermlnedby springs until there was
no longer suﬂ‘iclent'support, and in the
twinkling "of aneye a large part of
the mountain slid down and ‘shot
acrossthe valley, damm-ing its river
with Va‘ ‘lofty, and impervious wall.
Masses of rock_were hurled a mile
"away, blocks of limestone weighing 30
to 50 tons being sent through the "air
like huge cannon shots. It is esti-»
niatedgthat this slide carried with it
800,000,000 tons of rock and debrls._

Plenty of Himalayan landsllps quite
as ext-ensive as this 'ha_veXbee_n re-
corded in» theflaist half century.

Aside from‘ the study "of landslides
with reference to the safety of human
life, there is economic value in. their
investigation as bearing‘ upon man's
.search for the precious metals. The

for goldjor other metalliferous deposits
in certain rock strata, and in ordinary
mountain formations these strata are
fairly . regular; at least thelri positions .
can be determined. T,There may ‘be
rock faults, but these the keen'geol-
oglst can trace. However, it is evident
that even men who are supposed to see
down '_a thousand feet into the earth's
crust must‘ be perplexed when the
surface of a mountalnslides off, and
two or three strata come tumbling
downto pile upon the slopes and the
valleys to a depth offrom ten to sev-’,
eral hundredV.,feet'. This chaot._lc_ Icon-'
d1tl'0D"_0f the rocks in -o landslide area
is therefore‘ the despair ofthe miner
and most trying ‘even "to .the experi-
enced geolog'lst_.V . _ .. I _

' In recent years, the determin-
ationof high school champions-inrthe ‘Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic'League' has been one of the hardest problems for solution by the
league officials, but the stadium, owned 'by_a -school that has always fostered
this loop, is a remedy. Obviously, not all of the scholastic contests‘ can be
run off in the stadium, in its accompanying gym, or in its swin‘1ming.pools,
but- all of thefchampionship tilts will eventually’ ﬁnd themselves "as part of.

Olympic paths with__the colors of’ Uncle -Sam?” It is not improbable that the
