Arecurring scene played out through thema-
j ority of Pitt’s game against Virginia on Sunday.
The team on offense methodically works the
ball around the courtwhile players make cuts
through the defense, ﬁghting to prevent open
ﬂoor space. All the while, the shot clock ticks
down. '

That tendency is telling of both the type
of teams — ones with grinding defense and
acute offensive abilities —— and of the type of
game —— one where every possession matters,
and the last one might decide the outcome.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said he saw the
contest heading in that direction.

“This is a one—possession game,” Dixon
said after the Panthers’ 48-45 loss. “And we
knew it would be a low—possession game and
teams would be taking guarded shots for most
of the game, and that’s what it was.”

Virginia head coach Tony Bennett saw the
trend too. '

“It was a hard—fought game. There wasn’t
many easy looks out there,” Bennett said.
“Each team felt like they had the chance to
maybe separate, maybe get up ﬁve or six, but
then the other team would make a play. It was

Two students
rescue man

Not everyone can say they’ve saved a man
from a burning building.

But now, two Pitt juniors can.

Josh Yoskosky, a ﬁnance and pre—law
major, said he andjoe Fogiato, a marketing
and supply chain management major, were
getting ready to go to the gym at about 5:30
p.m. Friday when they heard a commotion
outside of their South Oakland apartment
on Parkview Avenue.

Fogiato went outside to investigate the
noise. After realizing the housenext door
was on ﬁre, he ran back inside to put on
his shoes_ and called for his roommate to
help him.

The burning home belonged to an elder-
ly couple — known by the students as Mr.
and Mrs. Simon — but besides neighborly
pleasantries, the juniors did not know the
couple all that well.

“We saw them sometimes on their
porch, but that was the extent of it,” Yo-
skosky said. _

According to the Allegheny County
Property Assessment webpage’s listing
for the address, Douglas and Anne Simon
are the owners of the property. '

_ For The Pitt News

As part of a “toxic popcorn” team-build-
ing exercise at Pitt’s Emerging Leaders
Program,«groups of students worked
together to transfer popcorn kernels
from one coffee can to another using
only two materials: string and a strap.
Once the 15-minute warning sound-
ed, one team hurriedly utilized a com-
plicated mess of strings to successfully
complete the challenge. But as the can ,
toppled, popcorn poured onto the floor,
and the opposing team loudly cheered.
The exercise was just one of many
during the Emerging Leaders Program,
a weekend-long event that took place on
the ﬁfth and sixth floors ofthe William
Pitt Union from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2. The
program, which required a $60 regis-
tration fee from student participants,
encouraged students to learn about
different forms ofleadership and how
to incorporate their own leadership
into their daily lives during and after

by solving a problem that’s outside of
their academic fields,” Rothrock said.

Allen Howard, a freshman. major-
ing in information sciences, said he
participated in the weekend program
because he commutes from Monroeville

and wanted to be more involved’ in on-
campus events. ' . '

He also plans to pursue the Dietrich
School of Arts and Sciences leadership
certificate, a program offered to stu-
dents to motivate and inform them of
how to better serve their communities.
The Emerging Leaders program fulﬁlls
a requirement for the certificate.

"‘It_ was a step out of the comfort zone
to work with people we don’t know,
which is very important for leadership,”
Howard said. V

The Emerging Leaders program has
existed in someforrn at Pitt since the
1980s, Rothrock said, but the current
curriculum has been a staple of the Di-.
vision of Student Affairs since .2004.
Last spring, the University began to

college. About 90 participants were
divided into four groups led by a facili-
tation team, which led the proceedings
and included a trained faculty or staff
member and two student peers.
Students could also register with

members of student organizations they
belonged to for a registration fee of
$40.
This weekend’s sessions took place
‘from 6 to 9:30 p.m. Friday, 9 a.m. to
. 5 p.m. Saturday and»10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Sunday.

Summer Rothrock, assistant direc-
tor of leadership development and
Greek affairs, said the toxic popcorn
exercise aims to evaluate how students
respond to an unusual situation.

“The purpose is for students to en-
gage in understanding group dynamics

offer two weekend-long programs each
semester. ‘ ‘ '
This semester’s nine-week program

is still available to students between.

Jan. 29 and April 3.

LEADERS 

According to its website, the Emerg-

ing Leaders program aims to instill
“fundamentals of leadership” — self
knowledge, valuing others, integrity:
personal accountability and change —
within participants.

Janine Fisher, the Student Affairs
communications manager who helped
coordinate the event, said this week-
end’s event was a condensed version

February 8, 2014 | The Pitt News '| \/w\A/v.pitmevvs.cem

of the ‘nine—week event for students .

looking to brush up on their leader-
ship skills. ‘

“The same lessons are taught but
only in the timespan of three days,”
Fisher said. “[The weekend-long pro-
gram] is used as another option for stu-
dents who prefer to get it done quickly.”

Fisher said that although the nine- ’

week program takes longer to complete,

_ students can pick from certain time

slots to meet with their groups, allow-
ing more flexibility for busy students.

On Saturday, activities included a
Myers—Brigg assessment -— atest de-
signed to determine personality type -
as well as a discussion on‘ stereotypes,
a break for lunch and other workshops
that addressed issues such as conflict
management and power and inﬂuence.

' On Sunday, activities included work-
shops on ethics and values, marketing
leadership and resumé building.

After the first day of the program,
Howard said he got a lot more out of it
than he expected.

“‘I really liked it because even though
there was a lot of information given,
it went smoothly,” Howard said. “‘The

facilitators mostly let the students con— ‘

trol discussions andactivities and gave
pushes when we needed them.”

Brittany Lewis, asophomore pre-
pharmacy major, completed the week-
end-longprogram last year and returned
as.one of the peer facilitators for the
new group this year. ‘

“I am more of an introvert and before
the program I thought that to be aleader
you had to be outspoken and demand-

ing,” she said. “Emerging Leaders taught

me that I could use my own strengths to

help others'.”|~

When I describe my hometown of
Lancaster County, Pa., to people
-who don’t know it, I tend to make
it sound as “Little House on the
Prairie” as possible: beyond ru-
ral, with inescapable Christian.
values and cornﬁelds coatingthe
landscape.
Inevitably, my high school
was very small. I knew everyone

in my graduating class, and they

all knew me.‘ Of course this al-
lowed little room for privacy, as
everyone was aware of everyone
else’s business, gossip ringing
constantly throughout the halls.
This is part of the reason I chose
to go to a large college such as
Pitt. Honestly, though, rumors
‘ just happen to be one of the few
sources of entertainment in a
small town, and one cannot re-
ally help but partake in spread-
ing them. I still ﬁnd myself Face-
book creeping on random people
from my high school, and I really

couldn’t tell you why I’m still in-
terested in my hometown scan-
dals —. they’re usually extremely
ordinary. I suppose it’s true that
old habits die hard.

In fact, as-much as I hate to
admit it, I imagine that the major-
ity of the habits I developed in my
years coming of age in Lancaster
County are still with me today.
They most likely formed when
I was attempting to conform to
certain social cliques, or in other
words, when I was doing my best
to “ﬁt in.’.’ Consequently, a good
many of my mannerisms and
social cues that evolved during
this time haven’t gone away. And
I think this is true for many oth-
ers: Personality tends to reﬂect
a person’s surroundings during
these sensitive years in life.

Needless to say, my home is
a hugely signiﬁcant part of my
life.‘But, about two weeks ago,
when performing my daily Face-
book newsfeed scan, I noticed not
all was right back in Lancaster.

Many of my former classmates
were clamoring for biblical—style
retribution against two other for-
mer peers of mine. I was shocked
— my friends were literally de-
manding “an eye for an eye” from
two kids I used to encounter on a
daily basis. So naturally, I looked
into the situation.

I almost wish I hadn’t. Two
men, Adam Lynch, 21, and Ryan
Schannauer, 19, were charged
by local police with the killing
of Ashley Kline, 23. The murder
allegedly occurred after the three
got in an argument on their way
to the movies, prompting Lynch
to pull over in a secluded area,
after which Schannauer report-
edly pulled her out of the car. Ac-
cording to the affidavit, “Lynch
told the troopers that he made
sure Kline did not escape while
Schannauer pushed her under the
fence. Lynch then told police he
observed Schannauer stab Ashley

Further in the affidavit, “Schannauer
admitted to police that he and Adam Lynch

"conspired to ‘scare’ Ashley Kline  [He]
4 then admitted to  dousing Ashley Kline

with gasoline while she was still alive-. He
then stated Lynch ignited Kline and then
both men left the area.”

Lancaster County District Attorney
Craig Stedman commented on the case,

“Who exactly did what is under some ques— ~

tion. What is beyond clear is that [Lynch
and Schannauer] both participated.”

This was extremely unnerving for me.
I did not know Lynch very well —- he was
a grade above me —— but Schannauer was
in a good number of my classes in high
school. Granted, we were not friends, but
just knowing I sat in class for years with
someone accused of such a heinous crime
is hard to fathom. But then I got to think-
ing: What could possibly drive someone
to do something so disgustingly horrible
to another human being?

I did not know Schannauer personal-

ly, but I was well aware of his reputation,
which is something hard to shake in a small

high school. He was, unfortunately, not.._

As I mentioned before, I’m a ﬁrm be-

just as I don’t think a drugdealer was born

his unstable emotional state. Perhaps if

someone had stood up for Schannauer in

high school and attemptedto be his friend,
they would’ve prevented the grues_orn_e

death of Ashley Kline. . g . .

Maybe I am wrong, and he was truly
destined to commit such an evil act, and
there was nothing anyone could have done
about it. But it’s worth thinking about. If

people in high school were less concerned
about reputation and the social pecking or-
der, maybe they would reach out to some-

one like Schannauer and would then be ‘

ableto keep a fellow student from becom-

ing so emotionally «damaged that he ends

up taking the life of an innocent person.
Of course, this issue concerns not only

my former high school, but high schools ‘

across the country. Bullying is still very
prominent: A fact sheet from the National
Association of School Psychologists states
that there are more than 3.2 million stu-
dent victims every year. And there unfor-
tunately is a suspected correlation between
bullying and violent crimes. For instance,
75 percent of school shootings have been
linked back to bullying and harassment,
according to Dosomething.org.
Therefore, if high schools do not take
bullying as a‘serious issue, I fear that we

‘ may see more cases likethis involving

Schannauer. Hence, the mentality must
be that if we want our students to be hap-
py with their future selves and the world
around them, we must prevent them from
growing up in a hateful environment that
promotes the opposite. I '

Pitt loses second

straight

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Virginia’s Malcolm Brogdon’s game-

.winning 3-pointer dropped into the

basket with 0.4 seconds to play Sunday
afternoon. In a game tied 17 times, his
head coach knew the outcome wouldbe
determined by one series on each side
of the ball. _ , .
“You knew it was going to come down

I to a score and a stop,” Virginia’s head

coach Tony Bennett said.

As a result, an unranked Virginia left
Pittsburgh with a 48-45 victory against
the No. 18 Panthers. I

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon also
foresaw the importance of a late basket,
knowing how the Cavaliers wanted to
play.

“I think when you talk about Virginia,
you’re not going to score as many points
given two really good defensive teams,”
Dixon said. “They’re going to work. the
clock and use the clock, and that will re-
sult in a low—possession game.”

As a result, Brogdon’s triple from 25 

feet out swung the game’s ﬁnal balance
in Virginia’s favor. But what happened in
the previous 39 minutes and 59Aseconds
resulted in Pitt’s second—consecutive loss
at home.

Even on Pitt’s possession before‘
Brogdon’s dagger, the Panthers missed

a three of their own when sophomore
point guard James Robinson’s attempt
bounced off the rim. But the possession
wasn’t over. Freshman forwardjamel Ar-
tis rebounded Robinson’s miss and went
for a layup. And missed. ' V

‘ Artis didn’t think he was fouled. He

only offered, “I didn’t ﬁnish. I gotta ﬁn-‘

ish.”

The freshman forward from Baltimore
ﬁnished as Pitt’s leading scorer with 11
points next to a team-high seven re-
bounds off the bench. Another freshman,
Michael Young, paired with Artis in the
post and recorded eight points and four
rebounds to give Dixon rare production

from the power forward position.

“We had some good performances by
our freshmen,” Dixon said. “I thought
Mike and Jamel played well and are con—
tinuing to get better and improve.” A

Pitt’s freshman presence was neces-
sary after ﬁfth-year senior Talib Zanna
had to brieﬂy leave the game after twist-
ing his left ankle. He later returned, but
“obviously wasn’t the same” after his in-

jury, according to Dixon.

Lamar Patterson was the only other
Panther with a double-digit scoring total
at 10 points, but shot 3-of—14 from the
ﬁeld. Patterson played 28 minutes, but
dealt with foul trouble that forced him
to the bench for crucial stretches of the
second half.

tight the entire game, we knew it was going

to come down to a score or _a stop.”

It was both.

The stop:

It was another typical possession in the
second half of the game. Out of a timeout,
Pitt passed and passed and passed, search-
ing for any open look. With the shot clock
slipping to ﬁve seconds, Panthers eventu-
ally found one. ’

Redshirt senior forward Lamar Patter-
son kicked to an open sophomore point
guard James Robinson, but he misﬁred.
Freshman forwardjamel Artis swooped in
for the offensive rebound, bounced the ball

once and went for the layup while falling.’

His put-back attempt failed.

Although it proved fruitless, Dixon liked
the opportunities. .

“That was a good look and [Robinson’s]
a good shooter,” he said. “That’s stepping
into a three rather than drifting and fad-
ing away. I think I would take that shot in
a normal situation. The layup that we had
fromjamel I liked, too.” V

Though Artis was off balance in his la-
yup attempt, he was steadfast in asserting
that he wasn’t fouled and put the onus on
his shoulders.

“I didn’t ﬁnish,” he said, perturbed at
the missed chance. “You have to ﬁnish.”

Once Virginia sophomore forward
Anthony Gill corralled the rebound, the
Cavaliers called a timeout with 9.1 seconds
to play. They got the stop —- two of them,
actually — and just needed a bucket. And
they hadn’t made a ﬁeld goal in more than
eight minutes.

The score:

Virginia freshman guard London Per-
rantes dribbled upcourt, crossing the half-
way mark with ﬁve seconds. He waited for
senior guard Joe Harris to whip around a
screen at the 3-point line. But Harris was
the decoyand sophomore guard Malcolm
Brogdon, who trailed just behind Harris
on the same path, was the option all along.

Brogdon caught the ball, leapt, released,
drilled the shot and silenced the crowd with
0.4 seconds remaining.

“We executed [the play] really well,”
Brogdon said. “I haven’t hit it one time in
practice all year. We’ve been practicing it
all the time, and I hit it today.”

Pitt’s N o. 7-ranked wrestling squad (11-
1) traveled to Morgantown, W.Va., Sat-
urday and levied a 33-6 victory on the
Mountaineers at the WVU Coliseum.

The teams were tied at two match wins
apiece after the ﬁrst four bouts, but the
Panthers took control of the match with
victories by Geno Morelli, Tyler W.ilps,
Max Thomusseit and P.]. Tasser.

Pitt’s wrestlers ended the match with
six straight victories to emphatically
break a 6-6 tie.

Women’s tennis against Morehead

State _.

Head coach Alex Santos began his ten-
ure as Pitt’s tennis coach with a 7-0 sweep
of Morehead State at Alpha Tennis and
Fitness in Harmar, Pa. The Panthers began

their match with a 2-0 advantage as the

Eagles were forced to forfeit a doubles
match and a singles point.
Amanda Wickman and Audrey Ann

,Blakely then defeated Andrea LeBlanc

and Hayley Wild 6-1 to secure the doubles

point for Pitt despite Taylor Washington .

andjocelyn Lu falling to Blair Preston and
Sandrine Beaule. .
Washington got her revenge in her No.
1 singles match against Preston when she
notched a three-set win (5-7, 6-2, 10-8)’
after dropping the ﬁrst set in a tiebreaker.
In the rest of Pitt’s singles play, Blakely,
Wickman, Lolade Ogungbesan and Kath-
erine Castro all won in straight sets. A
“We talked about creating a strong
foundation for the program going for-

ward, and as a coaching staff, we think A
the girls were able to come out with great

. poise and energy,” Santos said. “I believe

that our preparation and attention to de- ‘
tail leading up to today has been strong,

. and it allowed us to play the big‘ points

very well.” '
Track and ﬁeld, Penn State National
Invitational .

a 46.32-second run, which qualiﬁed him .
for the ACC championships. Nkanata won
the 200-meter dash after running it in

Virginia got its score.

“We just wanted to have a chance. I
told the guys at halftime that I lovethis,”
Bennett said. “This is where you want to
be right here,-right now. To score and stop,
we will make them earn it and get a great
look ... They could have gotten an offensive
put back on that possession, and you would
have to co-me down. It is a ﬁne margin of
error either way, and fortunately we were
on the right side.” I

iW?i(5oPs 1 .

Namely, the game’s ﬁnal seven minutes
in which.Pitt’s onlyvﬁeld goal came when
Cameron Wright threw-in a turnaround,
fadeaway, bank—shot 3-pointer to beat the
shot clock with 6:52 left to play. .

Fromthere, the Panthers went without
a ﬁeld goal for the remainder of Sunday’s
contest. ,

Patterson’s poor, shooting follows a
rough effort against Duke, when he scored
14 points but ﬁnished 4—of-14 from the
ﬁeld. The 29.1 percent shooting is far
below his 50 percent clip for the season,
which has allowed Patterson to score A
nearly 18 points per game.

But against good defensive teams such
as Duke and Virginia, Dixon attributes
Patterson’s below—average point totals
to the way the teams played against him.

“The numbers are going to be lower,”
Diiton‘ said. “They’re defending. They’re
not going to give up any easy shots. He got
into some foul trouble today, and that’s
going to affect anybody’s game.”

Virginia’s -Brogdon led all scorers with
16 points, Joe Harris had 11, and Akil
Mitchell added 10 with 12» rebounds.

Dixon recognized that missed shots.
were a recurring theme of Sunday’s loss,
as Pitt (18—4, 6-3 ACC) shot a measly 31.9
percent from the ﬁeld and made only 15
ﬁeld goals. A lot of misses came close to
the rim.

“I think it’s just something -we have to
get b'etter at,” Dixon said. “Sometimes
maybe you have to pass if there is too much
trafﬁc and too manygpeople around you.

A It’s a combination of things.”

Virginia (17—5, 8-1 ACC) also beat Pitt at
its own game in the paint as the Cavaliers

_ out—rebounded the Panthers 33~32. A

“They were more physical than us,”
Young said. “They just out-toughed us.”
The loss to Virginia follows Pitt’s

. .15-point loss against Duke on Monday,

which has the Panthers in the midst of

" -their ﬁrst losing streak of the season. A

potential win Sunday was one the Panthers
obviously wanted, and one Young thought
his team needed.

“Coming off a loss against Duke, we
needed this win,” Young said. “We needed P

' this win to bounce back and to get us back

where we needed to be.”§
