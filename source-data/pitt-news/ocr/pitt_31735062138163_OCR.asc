have an abundance of good news

awaiting them. On behalf of the Ex- .

tension Department of the University,
under the supervision of Mr. Mac-
Leod, such an announcement is made
possible. ’ ,

The Postoﬁice in the city of Pitts-
burgh has sent out an urgent appeal,

250 st dents interested in the type of

holiday rush. This appeal is expected

.to. arousea great number of-students

attending the University. who are en-
thusiastic concerning holiday work.

All students interested are urged to
register at theofﬁce of the Extension
Dpartment in State Hall,

The Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Rail-
road of McKees' Rocks has sentout a
call to the boys pf the University in-
terested in part time work. The work
offered is very pleasing to the boy who

desires to work a few hours at night, .

from 4 until 12 o’clock.

For further information regarding
such work, apply at the Extension De-
partment. 

All girls who have any typewriting

chances in this department for girls
who are, specializing in childhood-

Finally’ there have ‘been innumer-j
able calls from -the Y. M.’C. A. and
Y. W. C; A. branches of the surround-
ing districts, for girls and _=boys -to
assist in -gymnasium work or to act
as referees at junior. athletic con-

versity National Campaign
for $5,000,000 0

Pitt men and women, and in fact all
college students and alumnigshould
feel a deep, personal interest in the
campaign being staged this week by
the Roosevelt Memorial Association,
to secure members for the association
and funds for the erection of mem-
orials to the late Colonel Roosevelt,
than any
otherinan of the last 50 years, was
the pioneer in the ﬁeld of American-
ism, and the championzof the cause of
consecration of the citizen to whole-
hearted allegiance to”country and high
id ls. ‘ .

i tis hoped to raise $5,000,000 in the
nation‘-wide campaign now, under way,
~th_e funds to be used for the establish
ment of memorials, at a. number of
carefully selected spots, and the en-
dowment of ‘professorships at- several

colleges and universities to teach the

doctrines "and principles ‘for which
Theodore Roosevelt stood throughout
his entire public and private life.

The plans for the memorials are not
yet completed, but are in the hands"

of the memorial committee of the na.-.

tional committee of the association. It
is believed, however, that they will in-

clude the project of the community .-

land for which has already been a.c- —

quired;.' and which may _ultimately in-

clude isaga-more Hill; theverection of »

Next Wednesday 150 enthusiastic
workers will begin a systematic can-
vass of every school on the campus in
a, concerted effort to "raise. ‘$5,000,.

thoroughly comb the ‘university, and
will use persorfal solicitation in an ef-

So_ that ‘Pitt students can keep con-
stantly informed as to the progress-of
the drive, a unique bulletin board,-, will
be erected on‘ the, campus‘ between
State and Thaw Halls. {The upper
part of this board will be painted in
gold. _4 Beneath this the surface ‘will
be white. The lowerlportion will be
divided into columns for each school.
As the contributions from each: schiool,
increase, the white spaces in the
separate columns will be colored blue.
When a school reaches or passes-its
quota the blue will meet with the
gold. When nothing but blue and
gold can be observed on ‘the marker,-
it will signify that Pitt has justiﬁed
the hopes of the workers and gone
“over the top" with the entire amount

Quite a few alumni went to ‘Syra-
cuse. with the Panther team and while

they were sorry to see ;‘Pop’f War-
ner__’s men lose this game, they all had
a good_time,.and didn’t have any sore
spots. The people of Syracuse, in-

tended the glad hand to the Plttil-es
and made them feel right at home,
before and after the game. Some, of
the ‘Syracuse National Fraternities
had house parties and dances in honor
of the occasion, to which the Pittites

Headquarters of the Pitt partywere
at the magniﬁcent Hotel - Onondaga,-
and it presented a. spirited scene Fri-
day ni§ht when the Syracuse students
had it record breaking snake dance
and rally. -It was estimated that at
least. 2,000- engaged in this demon-
stration and it undoubtedly helped to

day. Old‘ timers said it was the
greatest demonstration of its , kind
that Syracuse had ever witnessed. It:
was late in the night before things
gotlback to normal and it helped‘ put

the whole town one edge for the game .

on the morrow.

«Saturday night the scenes. were just
as exciting. The studpnts, led: by
their band, paradied ddwntown and
through the» hotel lobby, giving their

‘one now and ,then for their defeated
rival. -It was a ﬁne show of real col-

on the Panthers.
Everyone agreed that itewas a great
game and that thebetter team won.
The Pitt players praised their rivals

for their clean game and said it they 0

had to lose they were glad it was to
so fair a rival. . .
standbys Missing. , ,

One man who was ,-missed. in the
Syracuse party was Dr. Walther Rid-
dle, Pitt's‘ “First Rooter.” The’doctor‘
was been bothered with a cold for
some time and his ”‘p‘hysici,an;advi’sed;
him to stay away. Perhaps that is

Rose and Al Hamilton“ ~-were also
among themissing. Is it any wonder '
that we lost? ,  ' ’

Some of the’a-mmni-*fthere were Dr. ’

Cal Marshall, former gridiron captain,
Dr. C. K. Shanor, who ‘always goes on
the football trips, Roy 0‘. McKenna,
an old standby, who mixed right in
with the boys and had a. good time,
Dr. .1. B. O’Donnell, of Johnstown, ‘who
became a great favorite with the
team while at‘ Camp Hamilton, Dr.
Harter of East Brady, and others. Dr.
P. V. (Pat) McPar1and, who is in
New Orleans, wired Pop ‘Warner; be-

“Pat” is usually on deck to handle the
chain on the ‘side lines, his Ipllace
being ﬁlled at. Syracuse by Dr. O'Don-

Penn’s Biggest Game’.

The Penn game is being billed as
the greatest attraction of the year at
Franklin Field and an immense throng

for revenge. They ﬁgure that they
take all that Pitt has to beat them.
The presence of a gang of rooters, led
by the. great Pitt band,‘ will help-a

lot. _ Cheerleader Scott is now co1lect- ‘

ing a fund to takethe hand down.
They will accompany the team Friday
morning. D ' ,
Many alumni will go with the team,
and it is "likely that at special train
will be chartered. The rate for this

is just the same as the regular fare, =

as will be noted from a letter from
railroad authorities ‘ published

elsewhere. But there is always a lot

of funon a‘ special football‘ party and A
this ’

those who‘ can should go on
-train. If it is notpossible, the alumni
rooters can go Friday night and ar-
-rive early Saturday ‘morning. 5.,It‘ they

intend to do this,~they should make.

their own reservations at once, as the
supply of berths will be gobbled up
quickly, owingto the extra travel.

“The Life Line-,’—’ considered the
most startling and spectacular of all

of Maurice, Tourneur’s ibig produc-

tions. will be shown at Pittsburgh’s
New Million-Dollar Grand‘ at the head
Of a Splendid program throughout next
week, starting Monday morning, 03.
tober.27. It is based upon a -great
melodrama of the speaking stage,
by George Robert

Epgland and America back in 1882.

\‘Mr. Tourneur has established a
policy of producing in realistic and
impressive motion‘ pictures the great

these was,_“The Whip,” which created

A ‘a. sensation at the Grand. Then came
* "SDOi‘ting' L_ife,"’ another great

suc-
cess. These were followed by “The
White Heather” and “Woman,’f splen-
did, attractions. “The Blue Bird.’_’ and
“The,Poor Littleh_R,icl1 Girl”; were also
good 'I"ourneur' pictures. The finest
of them all, however, is declared t

be “The Life Line.” . e , '

English life and the sea are the
settings for “The Life Line.” . It is ‘a
story bringing persons of all types
and classes into relationship. There
are aristocrats of the realm~+Gypsys,
crooks, members of the middle-class
and others, who come together with
exciting results. Two half-brothers
are the principal characters. One is
hailed as master of/the Gypsy band.
He is unable to claim his inheritance,
however, for he was born in America
and the proofs of his birth are in the
possession of the other- The latter
is a man withoutconscience or scru-
ples, a weatkling and afcqward. This
is the beginning of a story ﬁlled with
intrigue, unexpected
daring, deeds, comedy, pathos, human
interest, but most of all powerful
drama- The scenes are wonders of
realism. -There is a shipwreck, de-
clared to be one of themost startling
things that has ever been placed upon
the screen." Charles E. Whittaker
adapted the story to the screen.

A genuine all-star cast is shown in
“The Life Line.” It includes Jack
Holt as the hero, Lewis J. Cody as
his despicable brother, Seena Owens
as an unfortunate Gypsy girl, Wallace

Beery and Tully Marshall as quick- .

ﬁngered‘ crooks, who have an import-
ant place in ’ the story, and Pauline
Stark as the»-pretty leading woman.

On the program with “The Life
Line” will be a Mack Sennett comedy,
‘_‘Up in Alf’s Place’.’; the Grand News
Weekly, the “Topics of the Dayf’. and
the Pathe Review.» David Broudy will
lead the symphony orchestra in play-
ing a special number in addition to a
program? of high-cl-ass selections syn-
chronized to the pictures by Zoel»
Parenteau. Both orchestra and pipe
organ will be all-day features. Per-
formances will be continuous. from

Robert Trimble, ex-Col., ’.-75. n

Attended‘ the University "three years,
and had he been able to continue his
course two months longer“ would have‘
graduated. From the time he left
school until the present hehas been
’continuously in’ the employ of the
Pennsylvania Railroad System, for the
Pennsylvania Company, “Panhandle”
and “Lines West,” his present posi-
tion being that of chiefengineer of
the Lines West. -As a student Mr.
Trimble was a .member of the..Philo-
mathean Literary Society, and the
probable explanation of the fact that
this ‘was his only “activity” lies in
the circumstance that the literary so-
cieties were then the only student‘.
activities! He is married, has tgvfo
children, and lives at Glen Osborne,
«Sewickley, while» his office is in the
Pennsylvania Station here.

and Student Volunteer Movement are
together arranging for the convention.
The last convention was held in
K3»nS3..S’iCitY; Six years ago,,with 5,000
delegates. ‘A’ similar convention was
held at Rochester 10 years ago. Con-‘

- “If therelis, any meeting on this con-
tinelit concerning ‘which superlatives
are, not an exaggeration, it is the
Quadrennlal Convention of the Student
Volunteer Movement. The sixth in-
ternational gathering has just _closed
its«..session in Rochester, but its end-
less world inﬂuence has just begun.
The meeting was‘ of very great signiﬁ-
cance in at least five particulars: It
was great in the number and quality
of its delegates.  . A more eager,
alert, masterful, passionately devoted
body of men could scarcely be found
anywhere on the planet. A movement
which seeks ‘to enlist the brain and
heart of more than 1,000‘ institutions
of higher learning in the United‘
States‘ and Canada is a tremendous
_movement. . . . It was, great in its
speakers! and program. . . . Such. a
procession of the continents Such a
laying bare of the world’s need! Such’
-a, call to decision and consecration!
Such ta. summons to giant-hood! , Such
an uplift of the conquering Christ as
they brought! . . . It was great in its
sustained and increasing spirituality.
The great audience was hushed often
or silent prayer and there were groups
offleaders giving themselves to un-‘_
ceasing intercession. Many addresses
were aimed at the discovery’ and deli ,
volopment of the deep things of _life.
It was g'reat,inl its relentless facing
of the facts. Perhaps never before
has a. convention received. such a
solemn sense of a world emergency.
 ..-There was no glossingnwover of
'di5iliculties, no ﬂinchingin the fact ‘of _

enemies of Jesus Christ.— .It was a
'call"to make red-blooded men sglad and
at‘. the same time “drive them, back
upon the omnipotenceof God.‘ The
convention was great in its supreme-
hours. The interest was often at
flood-tide. «The convention drewltorefs‘
close without any undue pressure to
-secure volunteers and ._yet it S‘ was
stated atthe close of the meeting that

, The campaign opened Monday morn-
ing, and was marked with a great deal
of enthusiasm, and the enrollmentthat
has already taken place in Pittsburgh
has surpassed the expectations of the

tribute to the man, and the ideals for

William; Boyce Thompson, president
of the Roosevelt Memorial Associa-
tion, gaye out the following statement
from Charles E. Hughes, former Gov-
ernor of New York and ex-Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court ‘of the
United States, who is an honorary
president , of the association:

that is done, memorializing Colonel
Roosevelt, that there should be con-
stantly impressed upon the succeeding
generations of -America, the habit. of
thought and the ideals ofthat man as
he actually was and walked among us.
If there is anything that has rescued
,Washington from the mists of an -im-
possible legendary character, and
brought him to us and enabled us in
some way to reconstruct his life, it
is Mopnt Vernon andthe picture of
.the-«oéhditions amid which he actually
lived. And in a future day, I have no
‘doubt there will be pilgrimages to
Sagamore Hill in equal number with
those that are made to Mount Vernon,
and in that community there maybe
gathered various articles which will
illustrate his activities, -and there will
be continued the atmosphere of his
home, and the place where he lived
among his neighbors, and in his hours
of retirement after his public services.

‘.‘But after all; we have this to con-
sider. You can never perpetuate
memory by monuments; tho§e whose
memory will ever abide, "*need no
monuments. Nothing can be done in
the way of tributes to the great; they
abide because they are great, they
abide because there isfvsomething in
their inﬂuence whichf’humanity needs.

",‘There is an instinct in humanity
which goes out after the food of the,
soul, just as there is an instinct in the
animal to go out after its natural food,
and those who have really served,
those who have enlarged our concep-
tion of what the human ‘mind is
capable of, those who have“ really

students of upper-class standing can
recall the lack* of ‘a"‘Y” building in
their early years at the University.
Then there was no place to scan. a
book or write up a few notes between
classes; if they ‘carried their lunches,
they were forced to eat them in the

is halls or basement of university" build-

ings; there was no place to idle away
-_a few free moments- The Y. M. G. A.
building has ﬁlled ‘Y many of these
wants. Atthe disposal ‘of allthe stu-
dehts is a comfortably-heated, well-.
lighted hall, ﬁtted out with Y desks,
chairs, -musical instruments and
games. Commuting students who ﬁnd.-

iassembly Wm be held by it necessary to arrive on the campus -
longbefore the first class ‘ is ’ scheduled

to ineet, ﬁnd the Y. M. building open
for their cpnvenience. When‘ their
last class has been ’disIhis_sed and they

they “can start home, the Y. M. offers»
them a refuge, for it is open ‘until 6-
p, m. The student band and the stu-‘
dent orchestra hold rehearsals there,
Omicron Delta Kappa meets there, and
the building will be thrown open in-

should be «informed, according to the
authorities. An interview with C01-

ing facts: C C’ ,1 p,

A general misconception seems to
prevail among the students that the
R. O. T. C. is closely akin to the for-
mer S. A. T. C.» This is not the case,
There is nothing in common between
the two. _'I‘he S. A.’ T. C. was primar-
ily designed to meet the needs of that
‘time, and its purpose was to. make
soldiers, while the purpose of: the’
R. O. T. C. is to make oﬂicers. -The
R. O./I‘.»C. is training officers to
meet any emergency in the future.
Every college man, in case fof an
emergency, should be an officer and

One of the most popular spots inthe
University this falliis the Employment
Oﬁice in thebasement of State Hall.
Here sooner or later -all ‘youthful

«seekers ofrfortunei turn their faces.

And it is quite remarkable what a

large percentage of students are earn-

ing/feither all or a part ‘of their ex.-
DeIlS9S-;_ Many and varied are the
s,ources of income which present them-

selves to willing ‘applicants, ranging,
from teaching and stenographic posi-
tionsto waiting on table and taking,

care of -children. The differentftypes
of work may be classiﬁed under ﬁve

general headin§,s———te-aching, clerical-_
work, ushering, care-taking and path-1

letics. , ,

 -The ﬁrst class includes all teachers
and tutors. The second class, how-
ever, that of clerical work, covers a

much wider r.ange,‘for stenographers, ,
typists and clerical workers, of vary-

ing, degrees of proﬁciency have been

greatly in demand- The oﬁicesjof the

University and thos-e of Carnegie Li-

brary have been particularly in need ‘

of helpers of this sort.

Under ‘the third classiﬁcation we
find a great number of students, large- 

ly boys, who are earning their board

by waiting on table. In connection

Syracuse Proves too Much for
Warner’s Men-—Line _Un-
able to Stop Orange Attack.

it was hard to take and it’s
harder to write about, but since it
was bound to come, let’s take it
with a smile. After romping unre-
stricteniy through’ ‘four seasons and
part or two others_ the old Panther
ﬁn-'i.ll;.' met an opponent capable of
twisting its tail. The big Orange
team of Syracuse did. the trick, and
with a "vengeance, for they scored
24 points while the total result of
Pitt’s attack‘ amounted to _just one
ﬁeld goal, scored by Andy Hastings
in the second quarter.

It is folly to try to offer an alibi
-for the defeat. The whole fact is
that Warner’s men simply met a su-
perior machine. The aggregation
which Buck O’Neill has welded to-
gether is conceded to be the best
eleven the New York institution has
ever had. Experts go so far as to
compare it with Bob Peck’s wonder-

C ful Panther machine of 1916.

"I‘he Pitt line, which had kindled.
such hopes in the hearts of Pitt
backers in the West Virginia game,
was absolutely unable to cope with
the great Syracuse forwards. Time
and again the Orange linemen would
break through and nail one of the
“Flying Squadron” before he was
fairly started. Pitt’s
completely squelched.~ It is ~ unfair
-to "judge the power of the quartet

» behind our line by their perform-

ance Saturday, for they never had a
chance.

Of course, the whole Syracuse de-
fense was well nigh impregnable, but

four men in the line stood ’most
prominently. At the ends, G. E.
Brown and Schwarzer conceded

ground so grudgingly that ,attempts
at the terminals were simply suicide.
Big Joe Alexander, captain of the
a Gibraltar at left
guard. He smeared play after play
and it was his recovery of Davies’
fumble in the ﬁrst few minutes of
play that led to the ﬁrst Orange
score. 3 Robertson, playing a roving
center in Bob Peck style, was every-
where and not only stopped rushes,
but intercepted‘ ‘forward passes in
‘several cases.
' We hadn't [heard much of the Sy-
racuse attack and .naturally we
hadn’t felt the proper respect for it.
‘But the minute that backﬁeld started
to work, every Pitt man knew that
the old Panther had met the greatest
quarter of ground gainers he had
seen in years. Every man in the
backﬁeld is a star, capable of doing
anything on the offensive. If it can
be «said that one man shone more
resplendently than the others, the
honor goes to Ackley, for he stood
out as the leading scorer. In the
first half, he registered 17 points
for his team. ‘It is strange that
Bras-ha, Ackley, Abbott and Ewing
had been the subjects of so little
comment. It is doubtful if Eastern
football has seen their equal for sev-
eral years. ‘
Shortly -after

the ﬁrst kickoff,

' . which Pitt received, Davies fumbled
. and Alexander recovered for Syra-

cuse in Pitt’s danger zone. With
their backs against the wall, the
Pitt line held the -‘Orange big guns,

KISKI NEXT an
  mesa stmanuua

The game with Kiski on Friday is
about the hardest that the Freshies

wi1l'have this year as they are as
strong as ever. -The Saltsburgh boys
are the world’s scholastic champs and
for the last few years have given the
W. & J. Varsity a hard game, and
have held them to a close score in
every instance. Besides this the
Kiski team of 1916 walloped the best
team that ever represented «the
Freshies, until this year. Our present
yearlings of course seem to have the
edge on. all other of our Fresh teams.

The wonderful showing that the
Freshies made against Bellefonte on
Saturday gives us hopes of winning
over the Black and White, and a great
battle is looked forward to. Of this
year’s Freshies, Holleran, Clawson,
Edgar, Snyder and Williams are all
old Kis-ki men and on the Varsity De-
Hart, Hastings, Davies, Stein, Ewing
and Brown were all former students
there. This adds to the keenness of
the rivalry and about makes it an
,alumni game for Kiski. The battle
twill be fought at Saltsburgh.

 

Georgia Tech ‘Out for Revenge
--Old Stars Back

What is that saffron cloud sweep-
ing up in the sky ahead of us? It
comes closer and closer! Now
shapes of men can be seen in it.
Men in football togs dashing hither
and.thither, ‘shouting in a strange
language. Oh, yes! That is the
Golden Tornado that swept up from
Georgia last year only to meet the
Pittsburgh smoke and go home a
gentle spring zephyr. And here it-
comes again. This year_ however,
they are coming loaded for bear and
they are not a bit quiet in predict-
ing that they are going to tie ‘an-
other knot in the Panther’s tail. The
Southerners are bringing up an all-
star aggregation composed of men
of the 1917 and 1918 vteams, supple-
mented by a ﬁne lot of new mater-
ial. They have started out this sea-
son as in years past by smothering
all opposition and rolling up scores
never approached by Pitt. /

Of course, Pitt has been up against
a much higher class of opponents
than Georgia, but any team that can
romp over opposition as the Yellow
Jackets have been doing must have
the goods.

Recent Defeat Not Bothering Pitt‘.

No one can with accuracy tell
what the psychological effect of their
recent de-feat at the hands of Syra-
cuse will have on “Pop” Warner's
boys, but the way they fought at
the Salt !City against overwhelming
‘odds sends a thrill through the heart
of every Pitt adherent. 

The team showed the old spirit
that Pitt’Is football history is so full
‘of. The old spirit that can't be con-
quered. Moreover, the student body
has heard the Panther scream and
is ﬂocking to its assistance. School
spiritthat shas lain dormant during

Nmynwlnn nus win

was winning consistently is coming
to life and the largest turnout in
years will be at Forbes Field next

Saturday to back up “Pop” Warner
and his men to the last ditch and
then some. .

Tech All-Star Outfit.

Underbcoach Johnny Heisman the
Yellow Jackets claim to have a team
50 per cent stronger than last year
and if -that is true it must be a
w.halr;.. it is essentially the same
team they had last year and as it
is natural to expect some improve-
ment, there is perhaps quite a lot of
truth in their claim. A

Amis is at the pivotal position.
-He is an old hand at the game‘ and
has been showing ﬁne form this sea-
son. Leby and Dowling seem to
have the choice at the "guards, al-
though Coach Heisman is well forti-
ﬁed with a ﬁne bunch of reserve ma-
terial for these positions. At the
tackles Huﬁines and Higgins have
been performing in brilliant style,
both _men being towers of strength
on the Tech defense. Staton and
Fincher have been veritable whirl-
winds on the ends. They are very,
speedy and exceptionally good tack-
lers.

From a wealth of backﬁeld ma-
terial Guill has been doing the best
work at quarterback_. He is not
only a ﬁne defensive and offensive
player himself, but he also has
proved Himself to be a ﬁeld general
of the ﬁrst rank. At, the halves
Flowers, and Barron have been gain-
ing ground, seemingly at will. Flow-
ers’ Work has been es-pecially ﬁne
in the las two games this season.
Judy-Harla is the best bet at_ full-
back, but owing to injuries he was
.kept out of the last game. Gavai,
ihowever, subbed for ‘him and proved
‘able to ﬁll’ the berth satisfactorily:

‘her home section by trimming both

Harlan, however, is expected to be
in shape to start against Pitt.

REMAININIE EAMES WILL
  ALL BE DIEEIEUET

Those who have been of the opinion
that Pitt was invincible received a

Saturday. And ouch, -but it did'h71-r't.
Will the fact that Pitt has been over.
thrown react upon the other oppon-
ents of Pitt whom the Panthers must

meet in the very near’ future? Will
Georgia Tech, Lehigh, Washington
and Jefferson, Pennsylvania, Carnegie
Tech and Pennsylvania State throw
their gauntlets on the ﬁeld and de-
clare that they must be shown?
Pitt’s opponents are not of the soft-
est caliber. Just ask some of the
teams they have met. F’rinstance,
Georgia Tech, the Golden Tornado of
the Southland, who will opposethe
Panthers this coming .Sa.turday, has
started another season of v'1.':tory in

Clemson College and Vanderbilt Uni-1
versity. ‘They beat Clemson by a
score of 19 to 0, but only after the
Clemson eleven had held them score-I
less the entire ﬁrst half. This shows“
the powerful comeback that is packed
by lHleisman’s eleven. Some rebound.
Watch for it, Pop. Saturday they beat
the powerful Vanderbilt team by the
score of 20 to 0, largely through the
individual work of Flowers, their
spectacular righthalfback. He scored
all three of their touchdowns. One
man who will need some noticing.
Pitt is called upon to defend the
gridiron honor of the nor"?! Well,
we’ll trust it to Pop and the boys.
You bet. .

On the following Saturday the boys
travel to South Bethlehem where they
will play Lehigh. Lehigh has made
quite an impressive record this year,
having smeared Rutgers by the score
of 19 to 0, on October 11, and wall0p—
ed New York Agricultural College by
the score 01' 51 to 0 last Saturday.
The feat of trimming Rutgers by the
score of 19 to 0 shows that they have
some team. For, didn‘t Rutgers on
the preceding Saturday beat . North
Carolina by the same score, 19 to 0?
And the fact that Lehigh scored a
total of 51 {points against the New
York Aggies shows that the «South
Bethlehem eleven. has an attack that
has consi:.le1‘able weight behind it.
Added to this is the fact that they
will have the opportunity to see Pitt
in action this next Saturday follow»
ing their game with Tech. !

Following this battle will come one

classic of the season for both elevens
engaged. Wash-Jeff has a powerful
team this year, one that. compares
with the best they ever had and that
is saying something. They trimmed
Kiski by the score of 23 to 0, beat
Carnegie Tech 20 to 0 and ‘Saturday
they beat Westminster 16 to 0: These
scores show that while the Presidents
have not a wonderful scoring machine
they have a good one and a very
strong defensive aggregation. Any
team that can hold Kiski, Tech and

good line. And, no mistake. And?

year, one that ranks with the best in
the land and also one that can be
compared with the choicest of Penn
teams. Many veterans have returned,
‘including Heinie Miller and Hopper,
who form ‘an almost matchless term-
inal pair. Titzel, Wray and Little on
the line and Bell, Light and Derr in
the backﬁeld. They have overcome
all opposition down East, s-mothering
such teams as Penn Military, Dela-
ware, and Swarthmore. Against’ Penn
Military- they made 54 points, beat
Delaware by the shameful tune of
89 to 0 and on Saturday they took
over Swarthmore (the bane of their
existence in previous seasons) by the
score of 55 to 7. And that, after
Swarthmore had made the initial
markers of the game. Will Penn, un-
der the joint tutelage of Folwell and
Hollenback, delight in beating Pitt?
Have they forgotten the trimmings
they have received at the hands of
the Panthers since they resumed re-
lations‘?

The next Saturday they play Car-
negie Tech on Forbes ﬁeld. The
Tartan team has made a good record
this season, though they suffered de-
feast at the hands of Vvash-Jeff a week
ago last Saturday by the score of 20 to
0. They defeated Bethany in their
opener by the score of 33 to"‘0, were

beaten in their next game by Wash-

Jeﬁ, 20 too, and took over Case 16 to
0. The proteges of Steffen would like
nothing better than to take it out of
Pop’s boys. And they come over
every year with that purpose in view.
Is this their year?

game of the year. Coach Bezdek's
team has beaten Gettysburg, Bucknell
and suffered a heating at the hands
of Dartmouth by the score of 19 to;
13. They ran up scores of 33 to 0 on
Gettysburg and defeated Bucknellby
a comfortable margin so it is easy to
be seen that they have an attack that
will bear watching.

If the Warnerites come through
the season without suffering another
defeat it will be a case of coaching,
pure and simple—-what might be
termed Pop-strategy. The ‘boys have
received their lesson and know that
they can be defeated so they’ll be out

The only bright ray that could
penetrate Pitt’s cloak of gloom Sat-
urday was the wonderful showing
made by the Pitt Freshies. The way
-Coach Kerr's men hammered the
Bellefonte team was magniﬁcent. As
soon as the whistle blew the boys
started in. Everybody starred. Tom
Holleran, elected captain just before
the game, was the most prominent.
Hindman’s kicking was the best seen
for a long ti-me on a local ﬁeld and
his open ﬁeld running was scintillat-
ing, as was that of Byers. Hewitt,
although he did not have much work

The work of Tommy‘ Holleran,"

however, was the best ever seen on

The ﬁrst two plays-the Freshies

a. matter of marching; down the ﬁeld
with the ball. In’ the ﬁrst half sixty
points were‘ rolled up and then
Coacfh Kerr sent the second team
in and they got six more. Later the

their own. All in all it was ‘a. ﬁeld

introduced by the Freshies when sig-
