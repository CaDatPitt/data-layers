Rick Strom, the backup quarterback
for the Pittsburgh Steelers and a mem-
ber of Pro-Life -Athletes, told Pitt’s
Students for Life members how he got
started on the path to pro—life activism.

“If we save one child from the evil of
abortion, that might be the one child
that develops a cure for AIDS or writes
the next great symphony,” Strom said
at last night’s meeting.

Strom severely injured his leg in a
scrimmage during his senior year at
Pittsburgh-area Fox Chapel High

School. The injury limited his college

choices and he ended up attending

Georgia Tech University, almost 700
miles away from home. While he was
there, far ‘away from the inﬂuence of

his parents, he said he was able to see»

what values he had.

Strom said that during college he
began to accept his faith and see the
light, but it was not until training camp
with the Steelers that he got involved
with the pro-life movement. A team-
mate was involved in programs and
rallies supporting the pro—life move-
ment which Strom said got him started.

Since then he has traveled to many "

Another aspect Strom said turned
him to pro—life was a close friend who

wanted to have an abortion but decid-

ed instead to have the baby and give it
up for adoption. She told Strom it was
a great decision because she gave life.
He began the meeting by showing a
videotape produced by members of

Pitt asks for

$148.7 million -

from the state

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

-Citing a need to “remain a quality research
university of which we can all be proud,” Pitt
has asked for $148.7 million from the state for
the 1994-95 fiscal year.

If approved by the state Department ol
Education, the request would mark a 6.8 per-
cent increase over Pitt’s current state appropria-
tron.

Under the funding request, which the
University submitted to the state Department ol
Education last month, Pitt asked for $1321 mil-
lion for educational and general funds, $8.07
million for Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, $6.56 million for Pitt’s School oi
Medicine, $1.1 million for the Dental Clinic,
$522,000 for WPIC’s Services for Teens at Risk
Suicide Prevention program and $534,000 for
recruitment and retention of disadvantaged stu-
dents.

The budget proposal allows for a 3 percent
inflation rate and a maximum 5 percent tuition
increase next fall. In the university’s appropria-
tions requestfdocument, Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor said the tuition increase will
not be unreasonable for students.

“It has never been the intent or practice ol
the University of Pittsburgh to raise tuition to
unacceptable levels to generate additional rev-
enue for frivolous or unnecessary purposes,”
O’Connor said. “We fully recognize and take
very seriously our commitment to the people of
Pennsylvania to provide affordable education
of the highest quality to our students.”

O’Connor said an increase in revenue is nec-
essary to prevent an “erosion of excellence” in
Pitt’s faculty and quality of education. He said
that several cost-cutting moves, such as depart-
mental budget cuts in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences and the reduction of College ol
General Studies class offerings resulted from a
lack of sufficient funding.

According to the document, Pitt’s state appro-

priation has increased 6.2 percent over the last-

five years. Over the same time period, inﬂation

has risen by 15.3 percent and Pennsylvania’s'

general fund budget has increased by 26.2 per-

cent. “Chronic fiscal scarcity  results in a

series of missed opportunities for Pitt and for

Financial aspects concern of neu/family leave proposal

_ By Steve Kozarovich

Asst. News Editor

Opponents of Pitt’s new fac-
ulty family and medical leave
proposal say that it will finan-
cially overextend the university,
but one proponent says the

new plan is needed because the V

current one is “inadequate and
inefficient.”

“This is something the
[Benefits and Welfare]
Committee has been working
on for four years,” said Herbert
Chesler, chair of the University
Senate Benefits and Welfa_re
Committee. “We found the cur-

rent plan to be inadequate and
inefficient so we broadened the
scope of it.”

The proposal for faculty was
unanimously endorsed by the
Faculty Assembly on Oct. 5, but
it has run into some opposition
since then, beginning at.the
Oct. 11 Senate Council meeting.

Senate Council has not yet
voted on the proposal. Council
members will review it at future
meetings before a decision is
made.

Financial questions have sur-
faced as the main issue in the
debate to pass the proposal
which extends coverage of fac-

ulty Ihembers taking leave for
medical or family reasons.

' University Times reported that

Interim Provost Mark
Nordenberg, Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Dean Peter Koehler
and Nursing School Dean Ellen
Rudy predicted the new plan
would be a major drain on indi-
vidual school budgets.
_ Koehler said he has not yet
reviewed the entire document
and analyzed the arguments
involved, but he said that right
now the proposal appears “too
ambitious” and that the “cost
could be disruptive.”

“This seems to me to be

something more than [Pitt] can
do," Koehle_r said.

Proponents of the new plan
argue that the financial ques-
tions can’t even be answered
because the answers are buried
in bureaucratic paperwork. A

“The financial implications at
current are buried,” Senate
Council President James
Holland said. “These are not
new costs. They are just costs

_ that haven’t been itemized.”

“We don’t know if it will be a
financial drain because we have
no figures,” Barbara Epstein,
chair of the task force which
developed the proposal, said.

“It may be very expensive. It
may be very inexpensive. ‘We
don’t know.”

Epstein said complaints
about the current policy being
too vague and open to interpre-
tation brought about interest in
revising it.

“It will regularize and equal-
ize how people will take ltimel
off,” Epstein said. “This new
proposal is important because
sooner or later during people’s
working careers  someone is

' going to need to take some time

off to care for someone close to
them.” The new policy would

ESC presidentfinds time for leadership, school

By Kelly Hanna
For The Pitt News

Her 21-year-old small body races around
the office of the Engineering Student
Council (ESC) as she listens with complete
patience to several different people talking
at once. Still managing a smile, she sits
down and under her breath whispers one
word: “Hectic!”

Along with the extremely rigorous
class schedule involved with being a
Civil Engineer, Jeanette Johnson is also
President of the Engineering Student
Council, an avid skier and an intramural
volleyball player.

According to Johnson, being elected
president of the ESC is a bit more of a
challenge for her because she is a woman
in a field thatgis so heavily dominated by
men.

“I constantly feel like I have to prove
myself more than a man in my place would
have to,” Johnson said.

“I don’t want people to think that I got to
where I am because I’m a woman. I want
them to know that it’s because of my abili-

astronaut, it is not surprising that she is also
who Johnson idolizes.

“She made it in a man’s world and she
accomplished a lot  that’s exactly what I’d
like to do,” says Johnson.

Johnson, a senior, says she loves Pitt and
has’ learned a lot both about how to be a
successful engineer and a successful per-
son, She is surprised at the family—like
atmosphere that exists within the people in
her classes. —

“At other schools, I've noticed that the
students in engineering aren’t as united as
us. We’re very close here. We help each
other succeed,” Johnson said.

A Murraysville native, Johnson is
adamant about staying in Pittsburgh. Her
roots here are very strong, she says. She
credits a lot of her present success to her
family. Her father is an engineer for
Westinghouse, her mother works in Pitt’s
Alumni office and her older brother is a
med school student at Pitt. ‘ '

“My family has been so supportive of me
all of my life.”

A high school cheerleader, Johnson never
participated in student government pro-
grams until she came to Pitt. She wasthe

that although her professors have been
great, she wishes that she had been taught
by a woman so that she would have had a
mentor. I

“I’m not a die-hard feminist,” said
Johnson, “but as my mom always said, ‘I
just want to be equal.”’

Johnson says her role as ESC president

proud that she has established a more visi-

She says she is proud that she_and

After hearing the name of the

Mortar Board sounds like it has
something, to do with a brick lay-

Actually, if one were to look up
the definition of “mortar board,”
one would find that the hats we all
wore for high school graduation
are mortar boards. The mortar

bol for one of Pitt’s oldest and
longest running clubs. Established

The Mortar Board is made up of
seniors “who are recognized for

vice,” said Dr. Barbara Arnold, the

active leadership and service on

Last night’s initiation of Pitt’s
newest Mortar Board members
took place in the William Pitt

members, Pitt’s chapter president,

Dave Wygonik, said “rejuvenating
the club” is a major goal.

a Along with this “rejuvenation,”
Pitt’s Mortar Board must work on
the main task at hand — the nation-
al service project. This year’s pro-
ject deals with women’s issues and
it will be worked on for the next
two years. No formal agenda has
been set yet for the national service
project. The Mortar Board celebrat-

Making beer, controlling
air pollution and discovering

an introduction to biochemistry

is just a portion of what Dr.
Ian Campbell, a biology profes-
lsor at Pitt,.brings to his stu-
dents.

Campbell said he really
enjoys teaching biology
because he feels more on his
students’ level.

He had not studied biology

_ in college or high school, and

he said being new with the
subject has helped him develop
a good rapport with his stu-
dents.

Some of those students are
learning about the business side
of biology in his commercial
microbiology course. ‘

In that class, students are
taught how to make cer-
tain kinds of drugs and

howthey are applied in the
business world, such as getting
patents. .
He said that he is very inter-
ested in “the use of microorgan-
.'isms“to“a'ddress societal needs,”
and that is one of the main

 

agendas taught in the course.

Campbell is very involved

in his students and
their undergraduate
work.

He said that “once
a day” he is encoun-
tered by students
who are looking for -.
advice in the very
competitive field of
medicine.

One thing that
worries Campbell, .
and something .

he always tells his
students, is the possi-
ble outcome of
President Bill ‘
Clinton’s plan to it
change the health
care in the country.

He and his wife
were living in _
England during the
nationalization of
Great Britain’s health
care, and he said it
was an “extremely
stressful time for a
lot of people.”

He tells some of

his students that are thinking of out.

plan there likely could be a

Campbell has a
few ideas to help
the university’s
_ undergraduates with
 their education.

He said he feels
that, although unre-
alistic, there should
i be a “fund only
used for undergrad-
uate student uses.”

This way, accord-
ing to Campbell,
“All undergraduates
get quality for the
educational dollar,
as the money they
spend goes to pay
their faculty and
maintain their facili-
ties.” I

Campbell also
said that some-
times there is too
much pressure on
students _to declare a
major. Most
students are going
to end up in more
than one career, and he
said it is the “educator’s respon-

sibility to prepare them for
changes.”

Campbell added that
an excellent way to help incom-
ing undergraduates would be
to get more interaction between
high school students and
college faculty. This way
“the transition to college can.
be made much easier,” he
said. A

Campbell came to Pitt in
1965 from his hometown
of Dumbarton, Scotland.
He was on his way to Aus-
tralia after receiving a
bachelor’s degree and a doctor-
ate in chemistry from the
University of Glasgow in

\ Scotland.

He made a stop in Pittsburgh,
and“ shortly after, he was
offered a faculty position. He
originally taught chemistry. But
when the field of biology began
to open up, he moved to that
department.

Campbell is married with two
kids and lives outside of
Pittsburgh. ‘

He said he loves teaching
biology at Pitt, mostly because
the students “are a great bunch
of people.”

Players and coaches from the

Redskins coach Joe Gibbs dia-

to what appeared to be a touch-

catch was negated because
instant replay officials said that
Monk’s foot was out of bounds

Gibbs said, “Instant replay

was able to change that call but
it cannot be there if you choose
the path of abortion.”

Pennsylvania,” O’Connor said.

In the document, O’Connor
said state grants and tuition are
the two largest sources of the
university’s ﬂexible or “unre-
stricted” income funds which
pay for faculty and staff salaries,
building maintenance and
equipment purchases.

However, the amount of state
money universities receive is
limited by the Tuition Challenge
Grant Program. Under the pro-
gram, Pennsylvania’s state-fund-
ed universities must limit tuition
increases for full-time in-state
students to 4.5 percent per year
if they are to receive any unre-
stricted income from the state.

O’Connor said the program,
which is currently in effect,
weakens Pitt’s capability to gen-
erate revenues because it covers
both tuition and state grants.

quences of a policy that so seri-
ously restricts our fiscal.flexibili-
ty can only be a ‘slow but steady
deterioration in the quality of
education,” O’Connor said.

According to O’Connor’s
statement, another “equally
troubling” aspect of the Tuition
Challenge program is the way it
awards funding to universities.
O’Connor said funds are distrib-
uted on an in-state student per
capita basis. This fiscal year, Pitt
will receive at 5.5 percent
increase inrE’duca'tion.al and
General funding, more than the
2.6 percent increase which
Temple willfreceive this-“year but
con'sid_erably--iless than the”4‘.9'
percent ‘increase awardedto
Penn State. Pitt had requested a
6.2 percent appropriations
increase. “This policy contra‘-A
dicts the long—standing practice
of granting each public universi-
ty an equal percentage appro-
priation increase,” O’Connor
said. “If continued over a period
of time, this policy will put Pitt
 at a serious disadvantage.” ~

Additionally, the Tuition
Challenge policy does not

include part-time students in its
criteria for awarding funds.
O’Connor said the nearly one-
third of the Pitt student body
which is enrolled on a part-time
basis is “being penalized by the
[program] because Pitt receives
an institutional appropriation
that is less than that granted to
schools with different student
body demographics.”

Pitt Assistant to the Chancellor
for Commonwealth and

Community Relations Dennis»

McManus said the Tuition
Challenge Grant Program
should be expanded to include
part-time students as well as
full-time in-state students.

“I don’t know why it doesn’t,
but [the program] should
include part-time students,”
McManus said. “It seems that
institutions like Pitt are there, in
part, to provide part-timers with
the chance to get an education.”

McManus said the Tuition
Challenge program was expand-
ed last year to include

Pennsylvania residents enrolled"

in graduate programs. However,
the program does not acknowl-
edge the increased cost of grad-
uate and first professional pro-
grams. He also said the universi-
ty will not know until next sum-
mer how much of the requested
money it will actually receive for
the 1994-95 fiscal year. He said
Pennsylvania. legislators -have

until‘ June 30, 1994 to agree‘

upon the total state budget.

-While-the state does not usu-
ally grant Pitt all the money. it
requests, "McManus ’said ‘he was
o‘pti’mistic about Pitt’s chances
of receiving what itasked for.

“I think’ the University has a
very solid case to present for
increasing Commonwealth sup-
port,” he said. “If the university
works hard ...it’s a definite pos-
sibility. On the other hand, there
are other pressing needs facing
the Commonwealth. We just

need to present our case as '

articulately as possible and hope
for the best.”

more adequately address the needs of all Pitt
faculty, according to Epstein. ’

“This is the key stage now that the problems
have been identified,” said Dr. Pamela Hepple,
chair of the Provost’s Advisory Committee on
Women’s Concerns. “Now is the time for some
dialogue.”

Accepting the new plan would make Pitt “a
more humane employer,” according to
Chesler, who served on the university-wide
task force that developed the proposal.

The proposal is necessary if Pitt wants to
continue to be able to recruit younger faculty,
Epstein said.

“Our university has to stay up with other
universities in dealing with these issues,”
Epstein said. “One of the first questions young
teachers ask is, ‘What are the leave policies?”

“It doesn’t mean we’re against family. I’m all
for family,” Koehler said, “but we have a uni-
versity to run.”

“Putting business in front of families is sav-_
age,” Director of Child Development Center_

Sheny Cleary said. “The longer a mother and
father can be with a baby, the better. The
workplace should support that. The return is
big time. Pitt will win in the end.”

According to the proposal, faculty would be
eligible for up to eight weeks of paid family
leave in case of serious illness or an accident
involving a child, spouse, parent or other per-
son for whom the faculty member “has major
responsibility.” Additional unpaid leave for up
to one year can be requested. Replacements
for faculty on family leaves would be paid for
by central university funds, but individual
depaitments would be responsible for paying
for replacements for faculty on unpaid leave.

In the parental leave section, the proposal
states that all faculty (men and women) would
be eligible for four weeks of unpaid leave for
the birth or adoption of a child.

The medical leave section of the proposal
would provide faculty with up to eight weeks
of paid leave for injury, illness, birth of a child
or other temporary disability. A physician’s
statement must accompany the leave request.

During all paid and unpaid leaves, Pitt will
continue to pay its share of health, life and dis-
ability insurance premiums, according to the
proposal. .

\X/hen a faculty member takes a leave of four
months or longer, the year the leave is taken
does not count towards mandatory tenure

, review, states the proposal.

Give teens another chance
i In Oakland yesterday, on Filmore Street, trees were
cleared of dead and dangerous branches. According to
Allegheny County 4-H agent Brach Barr Jr., “there’s a
need for city foresters,” (Pittsburgh Post Gazette).
But Oakland ﬂora was not the only thing that bene-
fited from this landscape enhancing activity.
Last July, Allegheny County 4-H and Penn State
Cooperative Extension founded the group Teens ‘N’
.Greens to get city teens off the streets and to give
them a sense of community. The four teens pruning
Filmore’s trees were performing a community service
“as part of their probationatory sentences for drug Vio-
lations, vandalism and other offenses,” (P0_st Gazette).
With the ncrease of youths commiting crimes, and

government officials like Attorney General Janet Reno -

calling for rehabilitation as well as punishment, it
renews our faith to see something actually being done.
I More than ever, today’s youth are suffering from dys-
functional families, violence and other social prob-
lems. They need to begiven a chance and sometimes
they need to be. given a ‘second chance. Teens ‘N’

A ,Greens is a program that can offer this to them.

According to the Post-Gazette, the teens wore elec-
triclmonitoring anklets under their uniforms, they had

: been searched for weapons and some were tested for

drugs, but those passing by did not know these things.
The youths were not put on the streets branded with
a scarlet letter announcing them as criminals; they

‘were allowed to work in uniforms and to perform a‘

giskill for which they were trained. This program should
jbe commended for providing a.,_form of rehabilitation
?‘which treats its‘%par'tieipants as I-hu*r“nan beings.

 One of the youths, Dernetrfﬁsi‘f'1‘7,"*l1ad a positive atti-
§tu‘d"e" laboi1t‘l:1‘is' worl€‘."“It §teac_l1es"y_ou_,  to improve ,

isomething  the  liere’s _really nothing

else towdo on the streetslbutnget -into trouble, so why

not d<')5't‘l1is'?’=’- (Post Gazette).
: The young offenders are paying for their crimes _a
iway that betters the city and improves their self
::7é§teenri;"Tliey are give-nmore than punishment; they
farie ..given pride‘. Andthe city receives improvements it
.l.m‘élY"I1‘,r;ver have seen". ' A if V H -

Although the project started out with youth offenders
frornftlre Hill District and Garfieldwho trainedand
worked throughout the summer and after school, the
program has been extended to inner-city youths who
have not commited crimes, (Post Gazette).

Hopefully this expansion will keep many city teens
away from trouble and help those who may have
already been in trouble. Both deserve attention from a
society that has often overlooked them.

A grant from the U.S Department of forestry funds
this program and Barr is looking for more money to
expand Teens ‘N’ Greens. Continued funding for these
types of programs and acontinued interest in our city
youths will benefit all of us.

Catholics must ﬁght against abortion

The Perspective page recently contained some
of the most blatantly anti-Catholic rhetoric that I
have read in print for some time. Milan
Marinkovich’s editorial claimed that the Catholic
Church is “bad” because it “attempts to establish
itself as the only authority on abortion.” His sup-
port for this is based on the claim that the
Church “violates dissenting Americans’ freedom
to choose the religion and beliefs of their
choice.” Marinkovich’s anti—Catholicism comes
out in both his shallow exarni—  _ ‘

So the early Christians did oppose abortion
and Marinkovich missed it. He then provides
evidence to show that the Church debated when
abortion was wrong. One Pope said ‘always’ and
the next said ‘after quickening’. The papal teach-
ing obviously vacillated, but why?

The answer, if one looks deeper into the
“Wavering Dogma” claim, was that the Church
was trying to promote its teaching based on
(what is, now bad) science. Aborting a human
J A  _ was still a crime, but based on

nation of the facts and in his _ .. 
conclusion. The claim is that the

CatholicChurch’s position claiming, “during the
first 300 years of the Church’s existence, there
was not a single piece of legislation dealing-;_ with

is ignorant bordering on stupid; the second is
reprehensible.

To begin with, the Christian Churchfor most
of its first 500 years was illegal and subject to
persecution. Christians lived in areas where the
prevalent practice for dealing with unwanted
children was abortion, infanticide, and abandon-
ment of infants. It was during this period that
the Church relied on letters published by its
leaders, and some of these dealt with abortion
quite explicitly. The Didache (c. 100 A.D.), the
oldest known document outside of the New
Testament states: “thou shalt not murder a child
by abortion not kill them when born” (Did 2:2).
Again the same statement is carried in the Epistle
of Barnabas (Barn 19:5) of the same period.
This period ended when the Roman Emperor
Constantine legalized Christianity in 515 A.D.
But these pagan practices of abortion and infan-
ticide were still legal and practiced openly.

If one were trying to establish the early
Christian position on abor_tion, one could also
look at the example of St. _Basil the Great (330-
370 A.D.). Basil was the .biSh_.op_ of Caesaria, and
through his writings convinced Caesaria that
abortion, infanticide and abandonment were
murder and serious offenses against God. The
response was so overwhelming that Basil, his
deacons and parishoners with their own hands

- took down the high walls where the unwanted

babies were left to die. Because of St. Basil's
heroic Christian witness, the Roman Emperor
decreed in 374 A.D. that all citizens of the
empire had an obligation under penalty of law
to protect the lives of their children. '

abortion” — a statementthat is either a public dis- 
’ play of poor research or a limited presentation in

-of facts to promote a particular agenda. The first

conception, an unique individual exists, intrinsi-
cally human, and distinct from her mother and
father. The Church responded, and continues to
respond to these facts unequivocally: the fetus
is human, and aborting is wrong. Christians
taught this in 100 A.D. They considered this as
science developed and once the intrinsic nature
of the fetus was established, they continued to
teach that aborting humans is wrong.

It is strange how those who so strongly sup-
port abortion continue to resort to twisting the
facts to support the relativist posture they claim
will “end the abortion debate". Unfortunately,
the Church and those who agree with Her will
not shut up and quietly “respect the opinions of
those who disagree” because the wanton slaugh-
ter of human beings is nothing to shut up about.
Those who think the Church “violates” their

‘freedom of religion by speaking out for what

She knows to be true misunderstand the free-
dom of religion — dissenters are free to leave
the Catholic Church, just as assenters are free to
join it. Marinkovich’s claims to “freedom of reli-
gion” ring hollow. He expects the public to
malignor otherwise muzzle the Church’because
She disagrees with abortion supporters, which is

to establisha tieﬁacta anti-Catholic state _religion..,._.

Marinkovich claims that the abortion debate
will cease when we accept differing opinions
about killing unborn persons. The abortion
debate will only cease when we accept the sci-
entifrc fact that human life begins at conception,
and respect the rights of the developmentally-
challenged and respond accordingly. Just as
twisting the facts about the Church is not the
answer, killing the fetus is also not the answer.

New football facilities beckon in distance
New weight, studying and training facilities proposed by A.D. Jaynes

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

There is always a buzzing at Pitt’s weekly press
conference following a win, but the Panthers’ 21-10
victory over Rutgers shared some limelight with talk

of new plans to upgrade football facilities in the very

near future. .

“Its always nice to talk about a victory,” Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors said. A _ ~ ,

“Our depths and ranks are small so we need
improvements on the football ﬁeld. But now it looks
like we’re going to get improvements in our facili-
ties.”

Plans for a new basketball and sports facility —-
a.k.a. convocation center — have been in the works
at Pitt for some time while actual completion of the
new arena is still years down the road. But now, it
seems some new upgrades to Pitt’s athletic facilities
may be coming sooner rather than later.

This talk of new athletic facility upgrades was
ignited by an interview during the Pitt/Rutgers game
with Pitt athletic director Oval Jaynes. He comment-
ed on the need for new facilities at Pitt and plans to
address some of those needs in the near future,
including refurbished weight rooms, training rooms,

and study and tutoring areas for athletes.

“These areas are included in plans for immediate
attention. They are _not associated with the convoca-
tion center. They are a totally separate project alto-

gether,” Jaynes said.

The plans right now place the new weight, training
and studying facilities in Pitt Stadium rather than a

separate physical plant.

“It is much easier to upgrade existing facilities than
it is to build new ones,” Jaynes said. “A convocation
center is certainly coming, but that is a major under-

taking.

“Plans have been on the drawing board for some
time concerning the short-term improvements. These upgrades to
our facilities will be realized much sooner than the new athletic

complex currently in the planning stages,” Jaynes said.

Private funds are apparently available immediately to pay for the

new upgrades of some of Pitt’s athletic facilities.

Pitt A.D. Oval Jaynes announced the construction of new footbll facilities.
But there’s always asking for more funding, according to Majors.
“I’m convinced there are people in the community who are com-

mitted to this program,” Majors said. “They just need [to be] asked.

And I don’t mind asking.”

He’s worn it all season
long, Johnny Majors has. As if
he’s known something.

Through an early
December press conference
announcing his reappoint-
ment as head coach of the
downtrodden Pitt football
program  through the
annual (and oft-sleepable)
spring Blue-Gold scrimmage‘
.  all the way through a
mostly pathetic 1993 college
football season, he’s cracked
that endearing expression
time and time again.

That wrinkled, grandfather‘-
-lovin’, wry-as-the-cliclcens
johrmy smile.

For most of the last two
months of the fall series
“Panther Slaughter”, the smile
was justified —mostly for all
the “positive energy, enthusi-
asm, attitude, dedication” —-
reasons Majors drove home
time after monotonous time
at weekly press conferences.
That or he didn’t know how
else to react to watching his
ballclub get pasted by scores
Arnie Palmer would be
proud of.

Then came Turnaround

Thursday.

A 21-10 upset of 16-point
fave Rutgers. A not—so—coinci—
dental announcement of new
football facilities by athletic
director Oval Jaynes.

From the Big Picture —-
the imminent long—term
future of Pitt football ——- to
the terrific effort by the 2-6
Panthers on 19 inch boob
tubes across America,

Thursday’s events at the New
Jersey Meadowlands cap-
tured and encompassed all
that Majors has worked on
since he took the gig eleven
months ago. It also justified
him smiling.

Johnny knew something all
right. Coaching, motivating
 moving for progress
instead of regress. Necessities
for competing with the big
boys.

If you’re still not convinced
this thing is going to turn

\

around with Johnny at the
helm, you’ll never be con-
vinced. See ya on the band-
wagon in ‘95.l

0 A twice-tried—and-true
formula known as the
ESPN/Majors upset came to
fruition thanks to such hard-
working—but-oft-nondescripts 
like Tom Barndt, Billy West,
Junior Green, Jon McCray
and some linebacking
machine named Tom
Tumulty.

Bartrdi was fabulous from
the get-go Thursday, register-
ing a career—high four sacl-;‘
to go with a forced fumble.
The six-foot-four"-inch, 7%":-
pound redshirt junior was
named Big East Defensive
Player of the Week for his
efforts.

West, as seemingly every
Pitt backup back has done in
recent years, exploded on the
Meadowlands turf —- dis-
playing a deft ability to both
slip and blast past opposing
tacklers. His numbers back it
up: 108 yards on 20 carries,
two touchdowns.

Here we go, baby.

Midnight.

Madness.

It wasn’t the Sweet Sixteen or
the Final Four on Friday night,
but when “Panther Paul” came
out to deafening cheers by the
Field House Fanatics, the lights

went down and the spotlight
shone,it might as well have
been.

Though it paled by compari-
son to last year’s inaugural
event, even the mildest of
hoops fans had to be moved.
And when the adrenaline of the
intros and the dunking exhibi-
tion subsided, I gathered a pen
and scribbled down a few
thoughts for my little notebook.

0 Will Cauley looked good —
-physically. He didn’t come out
and put both backboards in his
pocket like I thought he would,
but I really don’t think Pitt’s
seen a pair of guns like that

Last Friday night, while

getting geared up for
Midnight Madness, the
University of Pittsburgh
men’s and women’s cross

After disappointing finish-
es a year ago, both Pitt teams
went into the race as if they
had chips on their shoulders
and were just waiting for
someone, anyone to knock
them off.

“There is a feeling that we
don’t like all of the other
teams" in the Big East,”
sophomore Mike Umblebly
said.

The men’s team, who fin-

away with a much improved ‘

that there was no slam-dunk
competition; the pre-show was

Jason
Brame

enough to satisfy me for a
while. V

See, I was on one of four
teams —— a disappointingly low
quarter of the expected turn—out
—— to compete in the first 3—on-
3 tourney. A couple of band
squads, a_‘ team from Lothrop
Hall, and us: Chrissy, Bunch, a

«mysterious _wrestler named

 

Jeremy, and myself.

None of us are all-stars, and
to be perfectly honest, Chrissy
was and is better than both me
and Bunch, but we blended in
well. It was one of those “no—
link—stronger-than-the-chain”
ideas, and we cheered for each
other’s hoops and gave a quick
“S’okay, baby, just forget about
it and play some D”’ when
things went bad.

‘We lost our opener, 9-8.
Pretty disappointing, but we did
make an encouraging run after
being down 7-2.

We played each ofthe two
band teams in the second pre-
lim and semi’s. The first game
was tough but winnable, as we
skated away with a 7-5 decision.

Their second team proved to
be a much tougher challenge.
Luckily I popped a pair of

Professor Ca ues
every formula in

threes (they counted as twos in
the one—point scoring system),
Chrissy hit a nice runner and we
all D’d up strong to come away
with a side—aching 5-3 win.

The outcome of the finals was
disappointing, as the same team
that bested us 9-8 in the opener
rolled off five straight points en
route to the 7-4 win. We were
out-hooped, out-rebounded

and out—hustled — just plain

beaten.

Truth? We got a little farther
than I thought we would but we
didn’t win it all. That honor
went to the trio of Mar White,

Rick Bigelow and Vernon"

Vereen who beat us twice —-
first in the. opener and then in
the storied and much-publicized
re-match that followed.

I tried to rationalize the losses.

According to Jaynes,

funding has already been
asked for and is forthcom-
ing upon demand.

I S “I have no doubts that
the funding will be avail-
able when it comes time
to go ahead with our
plans,” Jaynes said.

“The feasibility study is
already well underway.
It’s too early to tell how
much we will need, but
we’ll take a look at it after
the feasibility study is
complete.

"The funding will most-
ly be coming from. the pri-
vate sector for this pro-
ject, and we feel enough
money will be there at
that time,” Jaynes added.

As far as the timetable
on the improvements,
they could not come soon
enough for Majors.

“I would.like to see
these improvements in
place by next September,”
Majors said.

“I would think We

them what is definitely
coming soon,” Jaynes

ers McCray and T umulty (law
firm—esque, eh?) have -tumed
some sharp opposing tailbacks
into mutts. McCray, a bench— ’
warmer to start the year, has
ﬂourished considerably. His
totals? 64 tackles —— four for
losses, a sack, two pass deﬂec-
tions, and a forced fumble. As
for Tumulty, what’s there to say?
He’s simply the most inspired
defender in the Big East, maybe
all of college ball. The Tumulty
file: 91 tackles, two picks, three
sacks, two pass deﬂections, and
a fumble recovery. P

Johnny’s doing the motivat-
ing, but don’t forget the equally
vital foundation builders to Pitt’s
turnaround.

0 Wonder why the fuss over
facilities? Take a deep breath
and follow this rationale:

Facilities bring more talented
players. Talented players bring
more victories. Victories put
butts in seats. Seats costmoney.
Money for the seats revitalizes
the entire athletic program.
Revitalization reinforces school
pride with alums from Maine to
New Mexico... Pride transcends
sports to paint a positive win-
ning image for the entire univer-

.- sity. Everyone wins.

realized that they were just better. _

They were pretty classy, too. Given the
chance to talk a little yang, they politely
declined.

“We just had fun,” they said. “We just came,

True. It took me a couple of minutes for that.

‘Pitt drops a couple and people start talking;

goals were initiated by the non-
stop defensive pressure. No
matter what the Vulcans tried,
they could not stop the
Panthers, who ultimately did
whatever they wanted to do.

The Panthers set the tone
offensively, defensively -and in
net early on.

The defensive pressure start-

:ed_in  gear from the start,
"and it wasn’t long before the

Panthers capitalized.

Just 2320 into the first period,
after a California th1'ee—man rush
was stood up at the blue line,
the Panthers turned around and
White led a rush into the Vulcan
zone. Er_1_tering the zone, White

.fed Elliott between the circles

and the rookie lifted the puck
over Kelly for his first goal of
the night giving-the Panthers a
1-0 lead. ’

After a goal by left winger
Masa Morakami, which boosted
the Panther lead to 2-0, Panther
goalie Moloney faced his first
‘real test of the night late in the
opening frame.

On another three—man rush,
one that this time penetrated the
Panther defense, the Vulcans’
left winger found his center ice-

/ man-alone in the slot. The cen-
ter took the pass, waited, and

snapped a wrist shottoward the
upper right corner of the net as
if to say, “I’ll take that, thank
you,” Moloney thrust his glove
hand upward and snared the

_rocket, much to the chagrin of

the Vulcan center,;who turned

. his head in disgust.’    .

i That was the first andglanjst
'1;;€‘ﬂl:f:qL1ality scoring " clt‘ranc_e_,_tl1'at
the ‘Vulcans had all nigl1t,_,and
the Panther attack wasfree to

.pa.d-its stats a little more.  ‘ '

, After another first period
goal: and _l'lV€ in the sécond'p_e1‘i—
od: to give the Panthers an 8-0
lead, Kelly was finally replaced
in the Vulcan net. The Panthers
welcomed the new goalie with
36 shots in less than 24 minutes.
Six of them found the back of
the net, with Trovato putting the
final"-‘nail in the coffin with just-
16 seconds remaining.

“Tonight, we played great as
a team,” \X/hite said. “For us, this ,
means that we are starting to
gel.” 0 ' ’ '

The Panthers look to add‘ a
few more digits to their scoring
stats when they face CCAC this
Saturday at Golden Mile. Their
next league match is in two
weeks, when they will face
Carnegie Mellon, a team that the
Panthers could not defeat in
two meetings last season.
