Admittance restricted After lA/vl

Dorm Security Yields

BY LARRY PANSINO

A restriction on non-resident
students being admitted to the
dorms after 1 a.m. will go into
effect as soon as the necessary
security doors can be installed.

The new security regualtion was
defended by the Coordinator of the
Office of Residence Life, Marian E.
Hirst.

“We had many outsiders coming
off the streets after the local bars
close. These people wandered into
the residence halls, especially the
Towers, and caused a serious
security problem for us. It was our
concern to curb the matter before it
reached critical proportions.”

When asked why dorm students
could not bring in guests after the 1
a.m. deadline, Hirst replied, “We
feel that 1 'o’clock is a reasonable
hour for students to be in the
dorms. That time was chosen to
control the inﬂux of non-residents
into the halls; we had to draw the
line somewhere.” '

Hirst said that it was difficult to
enforce the system of checking
identification cards before ad-
mittance to dorms, as was done in
past years.

“There was some abuse of
female desk attendants, and these
people will be replaced by hired
male detectives who will be on duty
from 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.”

Hirst does not believe the rape
that occurred in Tower C last July
expedited the adoption of the new
security system. “The proposal
was made before the rape,” Hirst
pointed out. “It probably would
gone through regardless."

Hirst was asked about student
opposition to the 1 a.m. restriction.
“I don’t know of much resident

student complaint. The resident
assistants (RA) and students I’ve
spoken with think it’s good. It
seems as though most of them are
serious about their studies.”

At least some of the RA’s and
residents did express opposition.
“The rule restricts students’
freedom unnecessarily," said one
RA. “I believe it should be
repealed.”

Student Government has initi-
ated plans to fight the restriction,
and social fraternity organizations
are against the rule.

“This is not the business of
Student Government, lnterfrater-
nity Council or Panhellenic
Council," Hirst said. “The
security measures are for the
protection of the dorm students,
who pay to live here.”

Environmentalists Respond

ToNixon Energy Program

BY RITA VITOLO

Asserting that the U.S. cannot be
“at the mercy of” Mideast oil
producers, President Nixon re-
leased Saturday an eight-point
program designed to meet the
nation’s rising energy needs.

As part of his revised State of the
Union message, Nixon is seeking
action on four’ administration bills
that would:

--Permit construction of the
Alaska pipeline.

--Open the way for development
of deep water ports to receive oil
from abroad.

--De-regulate the price of natural
gas at the well head.

--Authorize strip mining of vast
coal resources, mainly in the
Western states.

In addition, Nixon said four other
steps would be taken administra-

Fund Drive

Aimed at Corporation

BY FELICE NEWMAN

The University‘ of Pittsburgh is
beginning a $35 million fund drive
that will be in effect throughout the
1970's. The capital raised by the
drive will go to 5 major areas: The
School of Business, The School of
Law, The School of Dental
Medicine, the Library, and, pos-
sibly, a new Student Union.

Chancellor Posvar, Chairman of
the Board, William Rea, and Vice
Chancellor of Public Affairs
Bernard Kobosky are working on
the preliminary stages of the drive
which consists of calling on

Lynch Formulated Anti-hitching Law

BY FELICE NEWMAN

Councilman John P. Lynch is
currently formulating a new hitch-
hiking law that would ﬁne drivers
who pick up hitchhikers.

This law is aimed at the sexual
deviates who pick up hitchhikers,
particularly children, and often
assault them. Lynch noted that
there has been a 19% rise in
“serious" crime in Pittsburgh, and
that 90 to 95% of that rise was in
the number of reported rapes.

While the number of reported

.°"°“ .

rapes in Pittsburgh has, according
to "Police Superintendant Robert
Colville, risen 20% in the past six
years, the number of reported
rapes in the nation has risen 65%
during the same period.
Opposing the law is Councilman
Richard S. Caliguiri who sees
hitchhiking as an often necessary
means of transportation, notably
during transit strikes. Councilman
Eugene P. DePasquale, who also
opposes it, sees Lynch’s bill as
being almost impossible to enforce.
Lynch admitted that enforcement

would be a difficult problem to
solve, but insisted that his law
could be a deterrent to rapists. He
feels “a rapist would surely think
twice" about picking up hitch-
hikers if the law was passed.
Lynch added that he was not
attempting to stop responsible
citizens from picking up hitch-
hikers; he claims to have picked up
young people “going to high
school,” and will continue to do so.

corporations and foundations to ask
for gifts. .

Vice Chancellor Kobosky said,
“We’ve been received very warmly
by the people we’ve talked to thus
far, so it looks very good.”
Kobosky also said that the
preliminary calls, which introduce
the program to the business
community, will be finished in 4 to
6 weeks.

Kobosky added that a promise
for $500,000 has been received
from an unnamed corporation.
Gulf Oil is reported to have pledged
$1 million early last winter.

Posvar stated that the drive
would be a supplement to other
sources of capital, such as state aid
and the Annual Giving Fund. This
drive represents the first time in 25
years that Pitt has presented a
major plan for private aid. '

A press release issued by the
Office of Public Affairs quoted
Chancellor Posvar as saying that
the funds, “will provide the
essential impulse in elevating a
number of excellent University
programs to the level of national
greatness in teaching, research or
public service.”

tively and would not require
congressional action. They include
development of the Elk Hills Naval
Oil Reserve in California and
research on extracting coal re-
serves in a fashion that would be
“not too destructive to the
environment.” Moreover, he is
seeking a relazation of sulfur
emission standards imposed on
industrial plants as a means of

increasing supplies of heating oil,‘

as well as a sharp step-up in the
use of atomic energy to develop
electric power. 7

“We are seeing a situation very
similar to what we have seen in
other areas,” says Dr. Ernest
Sternglass, professor of radiology
at Pitt, and author of Low-Level‘
Radiation, an account of the
ecological changes produced by a

, nuclear reactor.

“The President and his scientific.
bureaucracy, invoking the catch-all-

‘in the interest of national security’
are willing to ignore the obvious
lack of safety and threat to human
health posed by the existence of
nuclear reactors.” ’

Dr. Frederick Forscher, chair-
man of GASP’s newly-organized
energy committee, cited 300-400
years of coal reserves that could be
strip-mined while successfully pre-
serving the local environment,
provided the areas were “ade-
quately backﬁlled” and steps were
taken to insure recovery of
slag-deposit regions. He said the
cost of coal would increase
approximately 50-70 cents a ton.

Chiding Nixon’s motives as a

“protection” of a nationwide.

investment of some $50 billion in
the atomic-energy industry, Stern-
glass proposed “greatly increased.
research and development” to
produce clean gas from coal.

Suggesting that the recent‘
shortage of gasoline, and the
predicted winter shortage of
fuel-oil do not justify further
exploitation of the environment,
Sternglass proposed alternative
means of producing energy,
particularly from solar and geo-
thermal sources.

Blacl< StudiesHead Sowande Quits

Fela Sowande resigned last week
as acting chairman of the Black
Studies department.

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS), will serve as acting
department head until a chairman
is found. A search committee has
been .formed but, Rosenberg
declined to discuss specific nomin-
ations. “We are being very careful

about the selection," he said.
Sowande was appointed acting
chairman two months ago by Dean
Rosenberg, replacing Dr. Jack
Daniels. The appointment con-
flicted with the faculty vote to name
Curtiss Porter acting head.

According to Rosenberg; allega-
tions in the Pittsburgh Press that
SouLande’s resignation resulted
from a meeting between Chancellor

Wesley Posvar and a group‘

opposing Sowande are incorrect.
“That should not be read into it,”
he said.

Rosenberg does not anticipate
any particular difficulties within
the department because of Sowan-
de’s resignation. “All the teachers
are teaching and all the classes
have been scheduled. The
academic process‘ is proceeding,”
he said. '

News Analysis

Reformed Process Needed for Vice-President  

BY
NJ. BROWN
AND
SCOTT MACLEOD

[Editor’s Note: The New Editors
will present a news analysis on
Monday throughout the school
year. The intent is to take issues of
major importance and offer inter-
pretation and analysis.]

In light of the current crisis
involving Vice-President Agnew,
the issue has been raised about the
process of vice-presidential selec-
tion.

June 15, 1804 was the date the
American people lost the complete
right to select their vice-president.

Before that historic day when
New Hampshire ratified the 12th
amendment, the people directly
voted for the vice-president by
actually voting for two presidential
candidates.

The candidate receiving the most
votes won the presidency, and the
candidate receiving the next
highest amount won the vice-
presidency. -In essence there was
no real vice-presidential candidate.

The 12th amendment was a

result of a tie in number of votes in
the election of 1800. It provided
that all candidates must specify
which office they are running for:
president or vice-president.

With the evolution of party
politics in America, this came to
signify that the presidential
nominee hand-picks the vice-
president, providing their ticket is
elected.

This problem was evident in 1972
when an overwhelming percentage
of the population was willing to
choose President Nixon, yet
reluctant to have Vice-President
Agnew.

Problems with this idea are
clear: if the President is unable to
fulfill his tenure, the vice-
President, many times hand-picked
by the President himself, becomes
the new chief executive.

-Historically, in the past 25 years,
three vice-presidents have gone on
to the presidency. Clearly there is
a problem that must be analyzed
more closely.

Reform ideas have been carefully
studied by the political parties,
politicians, and political scientists.

Briefly there are three areas of
proposals:

1) Proposals which would
abolish the Office of Vice-
President;

2) Proposals which would alter
the method of choosing vice-

presidential nominees within the
present national convention
system; i

3) Proposals which would
provide for the separate nomina
tion and election of the vice-

president.
The most practical seems to be
either to alter the way the

conventions choose the nominee, or
to have separate elections.

“I ran for the vice-presidency on
the grounds that the people ought
to elect a vice-president directly
and he ought not to be selected by
the presidential nominee,” says
former Massachusetts Governor
Endicott Peabody.

Peabody ran for the vice-
presidency for six months in 1972
because he realizes the importance
of the office and the dangers of the
present selection system.

“Just look in my lifetime,” he
said, “and their are five presidents
who had been disabled and
couldn’t perform his duties. Three
of these died.”

A problem with separate elec-
tions of Presidents and vice-
presidents is possible incompati-
bility of the winners.

“The nation wouldn’t suffer
even if they were incompatible,”
says Peabody, “because the
Vice-President has no power.”

“And many times,” he
continued," the President is

jealous of his vice-president and
shoves him into a closet which
creates this incompatibility
anyway."

Presently 27 states provide for
the separate election of governors
and lieutenant governors, and
several reform ideas for the
Federal level are based on these
state systems.

The Democratic Party's Com-
mission on Vice-Presidential
Selection chaired by Hubert
Humphrey is currently working on
reform at the political level.

According to Mark Siegal of
Democratic National Committee,
a popular idea for reform is to hold
two separate conventions two
weeks apart.

At the first convention, the
presidential nominee would be
selected. Two weeks later, after
intensive research on possible
candidates, the convention. recon-
venes to satisfy the presidential
nominees carefully thought out
selection.

Changes within the parties”

structure might prove satisfactory
in terms of short range changes,
however if the people are ever to
have a sufficient hand in selecting
their vice-prsident, it is rational to
conclude that the problem is not
really political, but constitutional.

Security Crisis ll

Recent contract negotiations between the Campus Police and the
University cast a ominous light on the administration’s handling of its
responsibilities toward both the university community and the Campus
Police force.

In recent years the Campus Police have made several admirable but
aborted efforts at upgrading their force. Their cries for improved
leadership and suggestions as to how they felt they could better protect

the university community have gone unheeded.

Three aspects of their most recent contract proposal, aspects which
would have contributed to the calibre of the force -- and hence, the

" security of the university community -- were subsequently rejected by

the administration.

The officers, represented by their bargaining unity, proposed the
inception of a “trial board.” The proposed board would serve as a
means for bringing grievances against individual officers for
negligence and misconduct. The trial board, they supposed, would
have provided a fair and legitimate means for dealing with the internal
conflicts of the force. .

Another proposal would have provided for additional officer training.
The officers felt that the recommended training would better enable
them to perform their function of protecting the university community.
This proposal was ﬂatly denied.

A third proposal would have provided an insurance plan increase
guaranteeing an ofﬁcer his salary for time lost because of injuries in
the line of duty. Campus police officers taking additional risks to

’ perform their duties, and becoming injured as a result of these risks,

will continue to be penalized‘ by this withholding of pay as well as by
the bodily harm incurred.

I, ‘There is an apparent effort on the part of the administration to cripple

and subsequently invalidate the Campus Police. Their absence will be
replaced by unmanned security doors, pinkertons without weapons and
without power of arrest, and curfews. '

We argue that this is not in the interest of the univeristy community.

Last Spring, during what came to be known as the “security crisis,”
aroused students petitioned the University and made their acute
concern for better security known. They received assurance from
Chancellor Posvar that their concerns were recognized and
appreciated. They also received assurance that he personally would
work, along with the campus security force, to provide them with better

protection.

Since that time we have witnessed the debilitation of our most
effective means of security; a debilitation which ran contrary to our
loudly, expressed demands and which was initiated without
communication to the student body of its reasoning or intent.

What the students at this university need is increasd, not decreased
security, and a security which is people, and not building oriented.

Because it appears that student concerns were not sufficiently
appreciated last Spring, it is essential that all students, student media,
student organizations, and members of the university family demand

I immediate answers to the question of campus security.

column and a Half

BY JOHN METCALFE. ,

Some of the most interesting things that happen
here in the city of Pittsburgh take place during the
summer, when the University is on vacation, or at
least not paying much attention. Last summer
produced the astonishing transformation of Fifth and
Forbes Avenues into speedways, on a temporary
basis. Careful observers will note that they are still
one-way, and still exciting to cross.

This summer a new effort is being made to add
interest to the life of the commuter. A proposal is
before City Council, under the sponsership of Council
Member Lynch, which would outlaw hitchhiking in
the city. As I understand it, the new law would not
affect the hitchhiker directly, but would make it
illegal to stop for the purpose of picking up a hitcher.
I think the proposal is foolish.

At this point you might expect me to attack the law
on the grounds it would be difficult to enforce. I will
not, although I envision many embarrassing and
funny scenes: man arrested picking his child after
school. Woman busted for giving ride to neighbor.
Taxidriver imprisoned on suspicion of giving a ride,
and the like. The argument is tempting, but it is not
good, if the argument were good, it would apply
more broadly. For ‘instance, it has been observed
that it is sometimes difficult to apprehend
murderers; to proceed from this observation to the
conclusion that murder should thus be legalized
would offend almost everyone.

The ‘proposed law is foolish for another reason. It
appears to spring from two things which trouble Mr.
Lynch. One, of course, is the recent discovery of
mass murders committed in Texas. News reports
suggest that some of the victims were hitchhiking
when they were lured to their torture and death. The
other is the curious statistic that, whicle the city
enjoyed an overall decline in serious crime over the
past year, a few categories, notably rape, showed an
increase.

I do not approve of rape, nor of murder, and I do
not wish to encourage either .of these activities.

A standard reaction among policaofficials is to
explain the increased incidence of rape on the greater
willingness of victims to report the crime. Mr. Lynch
proceeds to the assumption that the growing
popularity of rape is a function of the increase in the
number of women who hitchhike.

This is neat. The police are not responsible, the

city is not responsible, not even the rapists are
responsible. The increase in reported rapes is
blamed on those who are really responsible, the
victims. They must have dressed or acted
provocatively, they must have hitchhiked unwisely,
they must have chosen to become more willing to
annoy the police with reports they would have been
too shy to make a few years ago (When. presumably.
just as many of them were being raped without
drawing attention to the fact).

Mr. Lynch’s law is foolish, and he is wrongheaded
to imagine that a ban on hitching will remove the blot
of forcible rape from the city.

Perhaps Mr. Lynch imagines that hitchhiking is an
exclusively frivolous exercise, engaged in by those
who have no better use for their time. It costs nearly
a dollar a day to bus to and from Oakland, not much
by councilmanic standards, perhaps, but sometimes
more than a student has. If we take such a student,
without money and deprived of the right to take a
chance on thumbing a ride, what shall she do?

Stay home? This might be fine once in a while, but .

it can hardly be done every day.

Beg? There’s a law against it.

Walk? There are parts of Pittsburgh where not
even a Councilman is safe on foot. Most women
would probably be safer in some stranger’s car than
trying to walk to , say Wilkinsburg, or the South Side,
or even the Trees Hall parking lot.

Mr. Lynch has made a suggestion which sounds
like a solution, and gotten himself a name for feeling
a genuine concern for victimized women.
Unfortunately, he seems to have overlooked a few
facts. Nowhere does he report how many of the new
crop of victims were actually hitchhiking when they
were attacked. His proposal fails to improve the
security of such favority rape sites as hospital
parking lots, well-lighted but poorly patrolled
streets, and the buildings on the Pitt campus.

If this piece of idiocy is enacted into law, we will
(some of us) imagine that something has been done.
Meanwhile, women will go on being raped in ever
greater numbers, and the ever-worse statistics for
this particular crime will be explained away as
somehow the fault of the victims .

I am out of space and out of patience with official
idiocies. Wednesday I will go on to what I think is a
rational alternative to traditional hitchhiking.

The Woulcl—be Pennypincher

BY GEORGE ZRUST

This week I bought my books in
the Book Center.

A statement such as this is liable
to bring the response, “And the
sun came up this morning, too.”
Well, considering the original
sentence, such a retort may be in
order--except if you realize how I
eventually came to buy my books
where I did.

In former years, due largely to
the inﬂuence of a friend, I would
always come to the Oakland store
and buy books several days before
classes even started.

The advantage lay in avoiding
the crowds. Unfortunately, the
procedure was somewhat less than
perfect.

The disadvantage lay in buying
books which professors had order-
ed but only later decided not to use.

At many other stores_ a similar
situation is easily corrected by
returning the merchandise for a
return of the purchaser’s money.

The book store has the asinine
policy of exchange--retum the
books and you get more books. I
don’t know what happens if you do
not need more books, but it is
probably something to swear
about.

The Book Center will no doubt
defend itself on the grounds that it
has some kind of stinky deal with
book publishers and so on. Truly
the book store deserves pity, but
their policy still does ‘nothing for
the pocketbook of the student.

But back to my story.

So buying books early began to
lose its appeal because of caprici-
ous teachers and a business-
minded Book Center.

In addition, the Center’s
now-legendary prices added to the
disenchantment. The prices are
also explained away with pathetic
cries about publisher deals,
especially those concerning hot-
selling textbooks about 16th
century folk literature in central
Moravia.

And» of course, my increasing
reluctance to spend money was no
small consideration. I began more
and more to “cheap”: my way
through courses by borrowing
books from the library and from
friends.

Once I had decided to avoid the
Book Center as much as possible, I
thought about some of the
alternatives. My only conclusion
was that I am not a diehard
penny-pincher. ,

I never got past the thought
Stage, 38 far as co-ops were
concerned. I had heard that art

supplies were cheaper ‘in these

places. but for a commuter these

. stores tend to be out of the way.

 

Many times a student just is not
given the chance or even the time
to think about where he can buy his
books and supplies cheapest.
When the reading assignment is
there, the books had better be
there too, regardless of price.

Then there is the fraternity book
sale.

While I have these people to
thank for ridding me of one very
useless poetry book, I have to
admit that their.operation fails to
impress.

Even if it is the fault of careless
students, the disarray on the book
tables makes buying a matter of

I digging for something which may

not even be in the heap to begin
with.

Through no fault of the frater-
nity, the selection of books is not
what it is at the Book Center. The
hit-or-miss quality of the sale was
too much trouble and I left about 5
minutes after I arrived. Without
books.

Thus it was back to the Book
Center.

With the crowds and queues.
And high prices. And an
occasional surly employee.

In my moment of weakness;
saving money had too great a price
to pay.

 AAUP, PPU Vie For Appointment

we

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
[Editor's Note: This is the first of a
two-part story dealing with the two
unions (A.A.U.P. and the P.P.U.)
bidding for recognition as the
bargaining agent for the faculties
of the University.]

Faculty members at the
University of Pittsburgh are in the
first stages of selecting a recog-
nized collective bargaining unit to
represent the faculties, library staff
and graduate assistants.

Two unions are currently vieing
for the appointment of the
collective bargaining agent. They
are the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP), and
the Pitt Professional Union (PPU).

There are two steps involved
before an appointment of a union
can be made, according to the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Labor regulations.

First, 30% of the faculty must fill
out questionaire cards stating their
desire to have a union represent
them. ’ -

Once the cards have been
solicited, the faculty will vote for
the organization (the AAUP or the

PPU) to determine which group will

be the representative. The faculty
can also vote against forming a
union.

Ray Richman, President of the
University of Pittsburgh chapter of
AAUP recently stated why he feels
the union is better qualiﬁed to
represent the faculty.

“It's all based on traditions,”
Richman said. “We've been in the
ﬁght for freedom and tenure long
before other unions even got on to
the subject."

“And it seems to me that we are
less likely to disturb the traditional
faculty relations than any other
union,” he continued.

Richman explained that the
‘AAUP is taking a very hard look at
University expenditures for non-
educational purposes. He said the
AAUP feels the University is
spending too much money in too
many useless and irrevelent areas.

“The University has lowered to
every self-styled interest group in
the community and this has
become very wasteful,” Richman
added. ‘

Richman cited the present use of
University property on Forbes
Avenue as an example of this
waste. “We want to know why the
administration didn't consult mem-
bers of the planning, business and
economic faculties on the use of

this property.”

“Who in that administration is

Hirst said she would discuss
alternative security proposals
offered by the dorm students’
representative body, the newly
formed Resident Student Associa-
tion. The association's advisor is
Joanne Woodson, assistant to
Hirst. The security system was
generated by Hirst, Woodson,
head residents and the Student
Affairs office staff at the request of
Dr. Alfred Moye, Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs.

Hirst explained the exception to
the 1 a.m. restriction. “If a
resident informs the Office of
Residence Life beforehand of a late
guest coming in, we will make
allowance. The host must leave the
name of the expected guest, and
the name will be forwarded to the
desk of the host's dorm. The guest
will be admitted upon presentation
of identification.” ‘

better qualified to make those kind
of judgements?" he added.

Richman also stated that the
University gets into these difficul-
ties by pretending to deal with the
general problems of the community
that it doesn’t have the experience
in and that they have no real
contribution to make.

“So as long as Pitt professors are

underpaid, we’re not going to’ their questionaire cards. Both the

  Polyester Stretch Music

BY KARL BALDYS
PHOTOS BY RICH TYLOR

(Saturday afternoon in Schenley
Park, the Programming’ Board at
Pitt, along with CMU sponsored a
free outdoor concert. Buzzy
Linheart, Estus, and Bruce Spring-
steen werexfeatured. It went like

’ this.)

Some of the people drifting up
Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park are
surpprised. “Hey, is this a
concert?” An Irish Setter prances
up to the stage and sniffs at the

 

wiring. Somebody throws a frisbee
over the Setter’s head and he cases
it up the hill into the cool glare of
the sunshine.

“I don't know where he is.”

I'm talking to Mark, the
drummer for Estus, and a guy
named Sunny, who is just hanging
around. Estus is home based in
New York. Mark continues, “New
York isn’t New York. I mean
you've heard about the new drug
laws. ‘ So many people are
paranoid...Look, Rockefeller has a
dollar for every person in the state.
You know where he’s at."

Sunny’s eyes are hidden by his
shades. “I’m hip. Let me tell you
man, Music is where the power
really is. Love and Music. I mean
we could straighten up this whole
goddam system with music.”

Mark pushes his hair back.
“You know who I would have liked
as President? I think, like,
McGovern or McCarthy. Maybe
even Kennedy. John Kennedy was
a hell of a good President. That's
why they shot him."

Some Pittsburgh Police are
approaching the stage and as I look
around I see a Policeman with a
walkie-talkie.

“Excuse me, sir. I'm with the
Pitt News. What's happening?"

“It’s been reported that some
people are drinking. No drinking
or pot is allowed in the Park. When
there’s booze we have problems.”
The officer moves on to advise
members of the bands, and the
crowd, to stash the sauce.

“Hey, we need some help over
here.” More equipment.

Buzzy Linheart is tuning up,
getting ready for a sound check.
He’s dressed in a meagre polyester
stretch brief. He looks alarmingly
thin, stooped shouldered——
emaciated. As his muscles tense,
and his voice reaches out, his eyes
roll and blink like an electric sign.

I walk over to Bruce Spring-
steen’s manager. “Hi, I’m with
the Pitt News. You’re Steve?”

“Yea. But, like, who gave you
my name?/What do you want?/I’d
rather you didn't talk to Bruce
before he goes on./The group's
been together for about a year and
a half./No, l’m his road manager
not his manager. There's a big
difference./I really don’t know.

Where does anybody get started?/‘

The industry is the industry, that's
all."

Linheart comes back on stage.
He is dressed now and ready to go.
He starts off with a Rock ‘n Roll
number that moves gently into a
Be-Bop kind of jazz interlude. The
crowd likes it.

Some more’ police move in to
check the crowd. I see another

walkie-talkie.

“I’m Petrucci, Chief of the park
police. Everything’s fine. Just a
little drinking. You were
drinking. Whey don’t you print
that in your paper? Look, it’s right
in‘ the permit--no drinking.”

While scribbling the notes, “I
didn't read the permit or see any
signs.”

“There is never any drinking
allowed in the public parks,”
Petrucci says. “Look, we're just
trying to keep the booze down,
keep the pot down. This looks like
a good crowd. There isn’t any
trouble.”

“Yesterday’s religion,’ Buzzy
Linheart sings, “walking out
tommorrow’s door.” Stage hands
dispense guitar picks and tape
wires. They hover around
Linheart’s group as if they were
assisting in some delicate invisible

9

surgery. About 1500 people
applaud.

“Do they like Rock ‘n Roll
here?" Tom Nicholas, the lead

singer for Estus smiles. “We play
rock, mainly. I think it had to do
with the atmosphere when I was
growing up. Ever since I saw the
Beatles, when I was about 14, I
wanted to play rock. Of course
things have changed a lot. Rock ‘n
Roll isn’t considered just some
kids making noise in a garage, not
anymore. I think ithas progressed
technically."

Harry, another member of Estus,
walks over. “Hi.” Estus has only
been together for a year. They
have a new album on the Columbia
label and they just released a
single, Ninety Miles an Hour.

“Bruce Springsteen's over
there.” His artistic cool waxing
apprehensive. Springsteen shakes
his head at the sound system as he
ﬂoats through the crowd. He's
been writing and performing for
about 14 years.

Nicholas: “The smaller you get
a group the more you can do with
it.” Tom started this career in
Marshall. Missouri, a town that
banned his group from performing
because at one of their concerts the
local audience smoked dope. “I
guess we got them too excited."

“I think a new scene is coming,”

Nicholas continues, “forming a-.

round the music of the Doobie
Brothers, the Allman Brothers...
the acid rock thing peaked a few
years back.”

Springsteen’s piano player is
throwing frisbee with the sax
player. trying to unwind.

Harry. on guitar with Estus. sits
down. With a kind of red. white.
and blue warpaint under his eyes.

I A Spectator Sport?  

(Continued from Pad? 6)
Harry creates a contrasting image
with Springsteen who, leather
pouch on his hip, orange shirt tied
around his tanned neck, would fit
better on a movie set.

Nicholas: “We put a lot into this
first album. In fact we're about 18
grand over our budget. We got a
pretty good deal from Columbia,
but then we used their studio and
pumped everything right back in.”
He explained to me that Columbizf
pays the group a certain flat rate
plus a percentage of the sales for
cutting an album. From this the

group must pay for the studio they
choose to record in.

What about Payola, the drug
scandals, and the investigations
into the record industry?

“Payola, the drug thing, it's
been going on for a long time.
Sure, but that’s only about
two-percent of the people in the
industry. Most of the people are
O.K. It's a bad thing. I mean we
just signed up when the whole
thing broke. It’s not doing the
industry any good. But, it’s such a
small number of people actually
involved...”

Grabbing a peach from a drum
carryall, Springsteen wanders over
to his road manager. “What’d
they do to the piano? They moved
it?”

Springsteen: “Yea.
tight. Excuse me.”

Somewhere between Estus and
Springsteen the sound equipment
breaks down. The crowd waits, or
at least half of the crowd waits, as
the Programming Boards of CMU
and Pitt raffle away an album. But
when a dog discourteously lifts his
leg on a spectator I put my pen

They're

away and go home.

United Form

(Continued from Page 3)

Chavez began_unionizing the farm
workers in 1961 with his life
savings of $1200.
By the late sixties, UFW
membership was up to around
50,000 chieﬂy due to the consumer
boycott of non-union farm produce.
Then in 1971, the Teamsters Union
began organizing the farm workers
with the permission of the owners,
and now UFW membership has
dwindled to about 6000 nationally.
Under Teamster contracts.
wages are lower than. in UFW
contracts.. There is not provision
for pesticide (even though almost
1000 farm workers die of pesticide
poisoning annually). Sanitary and
working conditions are treated as
less important than by the UFW,
and the ordinary farm worker has
very little to say in the Teamster
organization.
Recently, Teamsters president,
Frank Fitzsimmons, announced
that his union was repudiating
certain contracts with growers, and
that the Teamsters had no interest
in further organizing farm workers.
The effects of the announcement
are yetlunclear.
iDuring the years when the two
unions were battling for the farm
workers’ contracts, there were
many allegedly rigged elections or
no elections at all to decide that
Teamsters would get the contract.
“The UFW would win any fair
election among farm workers,”
said Cisneros who added: “Who
has the right to choose the union,
the employees or the company?”
Cisneros also protested the
violent tactics used by the growers
against UFW supporters. “Last
month,” she said, “two farm
workers were shot in the ﬁelds, one
fatal1y.”

Engineering Down,-
Transfers, Frosh

Up This Year

KAREN BURGIO

[Editor's Note: This is part two in a
two part series on admissions.]
“Although our number of
applicants is down this, the
percentage of students accepting
Pitt’s offer is much higher," said
freshmen admissions officer Ed-
mund Harper in reference to Pitt's

. admissions this year.

Reasons for the lower number of
applicants to Pitt are two-fold:
fewer students are attending
college this year, but there are also
fewer high school seniors than in
past years.

Harper also noted that the trends
in 18 year olds are changing--and
that although white applicants will
gradually rise until 1980,‘ the
number of white students will drop
after that time. Minority groups
though, are continuing to rise in
college admissions and will con-
tinue to do so, even after 1980.

The University admitted 2,350
freshmen this year: 1,972 to CAS,
235 to th°e College of Engineering
and 130 to the School of Nursing.

Last year’s ﬁgures were 1,752 for
CAS, 262 for Engineering and 111
for Nursing. “Applicants to the
engineering ﬁeld are leveling off
this year because the ﬁeld is
becoming ﬁlled, and this decrease
was seen in the engineering
applicants,” Harper said.

Transfer students are up 200 this
year. Most coming from Com-
munity College of Allegheny
County.

Harper said that only about 5 to
6% of incoming students would be
from out of state, with the greatest
majority of students coming for the
Allegheny -County are. Mean
family income is approximately
$10,500.

Workers

Last year, Pitt administrators
promised in a verbal agreement to
support the UFW cause, by not
permitting non-union farm pro-
ducts to be served on campus by
the food service. It is alleged that
this promise was not kept.

Consequently, leaders of various
student groups will be meeting
with University administrators on
Monday afternoon, September 10
to discuss the problem. A
pre-meeting show of sympathy will
take place at 2:30 p.m. on the ﬁrst
floor of the Cathedral, and all
interested students are invited to
participate.

In order to maintain its active
schedule of picketting from five to
thirteen A & P Supermarkets a
week plus frequent leafletting, the
UFW Pittsburgh boycott depends
heavily on volunteers.

Something sad? If so, this review
could be the ﬁrst step in your

The movie rotates about the

she’s divorced and here's our
story. Because of the marriage
situation, they leave for a sup-

IIllllllllllllllllIIlllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

When a player quits the Pitt football team this season, it shouldn’t
provoke a great deal of attention in the news media. Usually, the
player's name is listed, and occasionally, a reason is given, such as
homesick, or couldn’t keep up with school. When Lou Ceccoin quit the
Panthers in Johnstown last month, nothing big came from it
immediately. A few days later, however, a pair of attacks on Pitt
football began. ,

gportscaster Sam Nover found out that Cecconi had quit the team
and although it is not know if he spoke to Cecconi, Nover pounced on
the issue and attacked Johnny Majors, accusing him of running a
concentration camp at Johnstown

Sam Nover never sa_wPitt’s Johnstown training camp. Nobody was
keeping him out, he just didn't bother to come up and see what was
going on. Nover would have had a fair complaint if he had been talking
about Penn State, where the practices are closed to the media, but
nobody was hiding anything in Johnstown.

Last week, an interview with Cecconi appeared in the Pittsburgh
Press. In it, he was highly critical of Majors. It doesn’t ﬁt in with
Cecconi’s past actions that he would want to make a big issue of this.
He was trying to make the team despite the doctors’ telling him that he
wasn’t ready yet. His father had lost a job as assistant coach along
with the rest of Carl Depasqua’s staff. Cecconi tried, but the
combination of things led to his quitting. .

When Cecconi got into a squabble over what his punishment was for
forgetting to weigh in, and he refused his assigned punishment, he was
told by Majors to leave the ﬁeld. He went home and decided to quit the
team. He wasn’t run off the squad. _

Cecconi will continue to receive his scholarship, as will all of the
others who quit the team and had four-year scholarships. In other
words, there is no scholarship gained by running someone off the
team, and no reason to do it.

If Majors had retained half of Depasqua’s staff and not kept
Cecconi’s father, there would have been justification for griping. But
Majors brought in a completely new staff, and from what the players
say and I observe, this new staff has it all over the previous one.

There weren't many quitters last year, even in the last ten years.
That was one of the reasons why Pitt has been playing losing football.
Pitt's players weren’t going through the rigorous training that its
opponents were. Anybody who has seen Pitt play the past few years
knows that the team was exhausted by the fourth quarter. 1t W011 t
happen this year. _ _ _

It won’t happen because Majors is making sure that his team is in
shape. They work on a conditioning program year-round, and as
several players confessed at Johnstown, if they hadn’t, they wouldn t
have been able to accomplish what they did in camp.

As a result of this need for conditioning, players found that they
actually couldn’t take all of the drills, and realized that if the others
could take it, the others would be playing in the games.

So for the first time in many years, Pitt has had a few quitters. T1118
is actualy a good sign though, as it means that it takes a little
something to be a Pitt Panther. _ _

Had the circumstances been different, Lou Cecconi would not have
quit this year. The combination of his being switched to d€1€ﬂS€ and

The Pitt soccer team has been
undefeated in three years of league
play. They have been the champs
of the Western Pennsylvania
Collegiate Soccer Conference for
the past two years by winning
thirteen straight games. Yes-
terday’s game was no exception as
the Pitt booters opened their 1973
season with an impressive 9-0
victory over Geneva College.

The victory was particularly
impressive since the Panthers have
only held two regualr practice
sessions so far this year.
Nevertheless, the team played
exceedingly well together, control-
ling the ball for nearly the entire
game. Their excellent passing and
dribbling, combined with their
greater speed, was just too much
for they young Geneva team to
handle.

The Panthers wasted no time
getting their first goal of the season
with Al Jutca scoring early in the
first half. The speedy rightwinger
simply outran the three Geneva
defensemen and came in alone of
on Geneva goalie Bill Wardle. He
beat the surprised Wardle easily
with a blistering shot into the
corner of the net.

As it turned out, Jutca’s goal was
all the Pathers really needed. But,
the Pitt team wasn’t about to settle
for only one goal. They applied
constant pressure to the Geneva
defense ﬁring shot after shot
towards the Geneva nets. The
second Pitt goal came off the foot of «
center Joe Luxbacher. Using his
strength and agility, he fought his
way through the middle of the
Geneva defense to score a brilliant
unassisted goal.

By the time the first half ended,

Monday, séptember 10, I973—THE PITT NEWS—.Page 9‘ V

  Boaters Blast Geneva

Pitt led by a score of 5-0.
Luxbacher added two more goals in
the first half and Ray Rex got a
third to put the shaken Geneva
team out of contention. The tough
Panter defense, led by Rex and
goalie Bill Haines, easily stopped
the few assaults on the Pitt nets.

The second half proved to be
identical to the first. The Geneva
squad continued to have difficulty
adjusting to the Astroturf in Pitt
Stadium. The Panthers took
advantage of the numerous Geneva
mistakes and were able to add four
more goals. Luxbacher scored his
fourth goal of the afternoon as Tony
Bolea, Boris Protiovak, and Ernie
Gross scored one goal apiece to
round out the Panter scoring.

Pitt’s defense was equally as
tough in the second half. The
Geneva offense was hard pressed
to even cross the midﬁeld stripe.
On the few occasions they did
break through, Haines was there to
stop them. Rated as one of the top
goalies in the East, Haines had no
trouble chalking up his ﬁrst shutout
of the season as he ﬁnished the
afternoon with only seven saves.

Despite the lospsided score,
there are still some questions
which remain to be answered
regarding the rest of this season.
For one, will Ray Rex be able to fill
the large defensive hole resulting
from the loss of Gary Midock, one
of last year’s standouts. Also, will
Bill Haines be able to turn in
another of his ﬁne seasons in the
Pitt nets, especially against such
powerful teams as Akron and Penn
State.

The opening win over Geneva
was very satisfying to the Pitt
booters but Geneva has only been
playing soccer for two years and
their team was yound and

inexperienced. Nevertheless, the
Panthers played very well as a
team as well as showing their
indidvidual skills. The defense
showed it had the potential to get
the job done and should improve’
with more practice.

Possibly a more difficult "test for
the Panthers will come next
Saturday when they meet Bucknell

in a non-conference game at Pitt

Stadium. Pitt defeated Bucknell
last year by a 2-0 score. However,
Bucknell was able to obtain several
new players during the offseason
and should show a great deal of
improvement. Pitt will take
advantage of a badly needed week
of practice to strengthen their

defense and sharpen up their-

ball-control offense. A win over

Bucknell could give the Panthers a
big lift to get their season off on the
right foot.

What Lies Ahead For
The MAJOR Change  

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

This Saturday will mark the ﬁrst
meeting between the Pitt Panthers
and the Georgia Bulldogs and both
clubs will have something “extra”
going for them. For Pitt, it will
head coach Johnny Majors’ first
endeavor at turning the tide of the
Panthers’ past. Unfortunately the
game is being played in Athens,
Georgia.

The Bulldogs, under head coach
Vince Dooley, have built up a
66-28-4 record in the last 9 years.
Dooley plans big things to round
out his decade at Georgia and has
the players to plan optimistically.

, ~

Returning from last years’ squad
with varsity letters are seven
offensive starters and eight from
the defense to top a list of 29 in all.
Andy Johnson is back to do the
signal calling and should be the
man that the Pitt coaches will worry
over the most. Johnson was voted
the SEC’s most valuable player in a
pre-season poll but had a sub-par
season due to injuries and an
inexperienced line in front of him.
He still managed to rush for 427
yards in 122 tries (3.5), and
completed 41 of 89 passes for 671
yards and TD’s.

Tailback Jimmy Poulis, who led
the Bulldogs in rushing with 566

yards in 150 tries (3.7), and

Pitt fans will get their first look at
the MAJOR change in Pitt "football

when the Panthers open the home‘
schedule against Baylor on Sept-.

ember 22. Pitt holds a 2-1 edge in
the overall series with the Bears,
their last meeting being a 15-10
Panther victory in 1970.

Grant Teaff is in his second year
with Baylor and has 25 letteman
returning from last years team. QB
Neal Jeffrey, TB Gary Lacy and TB
Billy Wilson will season the Bears’
backfield while DT Joe Johnson
and LB Derrel Luce are the
outstanding defensive returnees.
Other names to note are SE Alcy
Jackson, OT Richard Mason, SE-
Charles Dancer, LB Kevin McDon-
al and DT Vaughn Maddox.

Teaff took over a program _that
had fallen on rocky ground and
seemingly has turned the Bears
around. In all of last season
(Baylor went 5-6), the Bears were
close to their opponents in all but
one game.

Last year Pitt renewed their
series with the Northwestern
Wildcats and will meet them for the
sixth time at Evanston, Illinois on
September 29. Norwestern leads
3-2 in the overall series. Last year
the Panthers disappointed a home

the injury's slow healing were two factors that weighed heavily in his
mind, and he had several others as well. .

But whether or not Cecconi decided to quit, Pitt football does not
deserve to be chastized by several media members, as it has been.
Contrary to the two who have attacked Pitt, I witnessed the incident
that led Cecconi to quit, and saw almost everything else that went on in
Johnstown. The press was not kept out of any practices, and many

. players endured worse punishment than Cecconi would have had to do,
without quitting.

Pitt is commited to big-time football, and you don’t play Pitt’s
schedule without strict enforcement of rules and excellent
conditioning. If a school tried it without those two things, it would
probably end up 1-10 .

crowd by handing a 27-22 victory to
the Wildcats.

Back for the Big Ten contenders
are QB Mitch Anderson, TB Greg
Boykin and FB Jim Trimble in the
backﬁeld. Trimble was especially
impressive in last years contest.
TE Steve Craig, OG Don Haynes,
OG Ray Felton and SE Steve Harris
will give the Wildcats experience
on offense.

The Panthers will return to the
confines of Pitt Stadium on October
6 to take on the Green Wave of
Tulane. Pitt has yet to beat Tulane
in three recent meetings, last year
droppign a 38-6 contest. The last
two Pitt losses were suffered in
New Orleans so the Panthers
should draw some advantage from
playing at home. ,

Coach Bennie Ellender is in this
third season of riding the Green
Wave and so far it has taken him on
a 10-12 route. With 38 returning
lettermen (eight offensive starters,
four on defense), Tulane has been
picked in the top twenty by several
pre-season pollos. QB Steve Foley,
TB Rick Herbert, S David Lee, DB
John Washington, DT Charles
Hall, OG Mike Owens DE Mick
Truax, and C Steve Wade top the
list of returnees.

The West Virginia Mountaineers
have a dismal season ahead of
them and Pitt will be quick to
capitalize on the Mounties mis-
fortunes. Back for the Mounties
are only five offensive starters and
three defensive out of a field of 24
returnees. West Virginia's spect-
acular running back, Kerry
Marbury, went north to the

Canadian Football League even
though he had one more year of
NCAA eligibility. Adding to the
Mounties’ problems is the absense
of a starting QB. Brighter spots are
Artie Owens, RB and FL Danny
Buggs. DT Jeff Merrow is another
noteworthy Mountie but that's
where the list stops. Pitt players
could, enjoy giving it to West
Virginia with no mercy in Morgan-
town.

Boston College was the only
team that fell to the hapless
Panthers of 1972 and this year
looks no better, from an Eagle
point of view. Pitt piled up a 35-20
win last year to tie the overall
series at 2-2. Boston College is
‘returning 33 Iettrmen, 9 offensive
starters and seven on the defense.
QB Gary Marangi, TB Mike
Esposito, and FL Mel Briggs head
the offense of coach Joe Yukica, in
his sixth season (32-18).

Thelast time the Naval Academy
visited Pittsburgh (1971), the
Middieswent into the locker room

_at half time wondering if Pitt was

going to show for the game. Pitt
overcam a 20 point defecit to come
from behind and sind the Middies,
36-35. Last year was a different
story. The Middies took a 21-0 lead
into the fourth quarter and didn't
have to look back. The ﬁnal; Navy

coach at Annapolis and he will have
20 lettermen returning. eight off

difficult for Welsh to improve mush
on those marks. He has two

wide receiver. The October 27
clash will be homecoming for Pitt.

Ben Schwartzwalder will be
starting a quarter of a century as
the head coach of the Syracuse
Orange and plans to retire at the
end of the year. His composite is
impressive (151-82-3) but the
Orange are tied with Pitt in the
overall series, 13-13-2. Last year
the Orange slopped to a 10-6 win
over the Panthers in a muddy field.

QB Rob Stuttum and FB Steve
Webster head the list of 28
returning lettermen who will try to
break ajinx that Pitt Stadium holds
over the Orange. They have not
won in Pittsburgh since 1967. Last
year was the first time in 22
seasons that the Orangemen did
not have a winning campaign.

If there’s one team that will
always pack Pitt Sritadium, no
matter who the coach of the
Panthers may be, it has to be Notre
Dame. The Irish carry a strong
contingency in any city and
Pittsburgh is no different. This
season should be quite another
story with the personality of
Johnny Majors taking the Steel
City by storm.

Ara Parseghian's reputation is
extremely well known and this year
he has 23 returning lettermen
including seven starters from each
unit. The Irish are fresh from the
Orange Bowl and picked highly by
every poll. including some number
one choices.

On the overall series, Pitt has a
lot of catching up to do being on the
tail end of11—26-l slate. Pitt hasn't
beaten the Irish since 1963 and last
year the Panthers held Notre Dame
close for three quarters until Ara
Parseghian decided to run up the
score.

Pitt didn’t play Army last year
but do hold the overall edge on the
Cadets, 9-6-2. In their last meeting
(in 1971) Army topped‘ Pitt, 17-14.
This year, Coach Tom Cahill has
his work cut out with only 16
returnees from a 6-4 team.

Believe it or not, Pitt has the
edge on the Nittany Lions of Penn
State in a series that dates back to
1893, 35-34-3. Coach Joe Paterno

lost the recruiting battle to Johnny‘

Majors but still has a wealth of
talent to fallback on. Tom Shuman,
a quick strong QB that has
problems with his accuracy, ap-

pears to have the signal calling spot I

nailed down. Add TB John
Cappelletti, FB Tom Donchez, DH
Buddy Ellis, DT Randy Crowder
and over two dozen other returning
lettermen and PSU will have no
trouble retaining their number one
spot in the East.

Johnny Majors undoubtedly set
some kind of record this year when
he recruited 65 freshmen, nine Jr.
College tranfers, and ﬁve walkons
for the 1973 Pitt Panther football
team.

Coupled with the 80 or so

they have to remember all the

So, for all the frustration and
