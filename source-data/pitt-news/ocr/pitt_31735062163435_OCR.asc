In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

, For my recent motion picture columns I have put a great amount of emphasis of the
director andihis contributions. I have praised. the works of Fellini, Visconti, and Reed be-
cause the director will always be the major creator of the motion picture and will always
be directly responsible for the ﬁlm’s success or failure. Actors, producers, cameramen and
scenarists all have their deﬁnite functions to perform but the end product will always be the
director’s. I will take this time and space allotted me by my peers and try to offer a preview

of some important up and comingé

motion pictures and the guiding

3 lights who deserve most of the

praise usually_accored the actors.

The elites of the cinema in the
United States are, in my opinion,
George Stevens, Fred Zinneman,
John Huston, and Otto Preminger.
These are 4 of the ﬁnest creators

of the cinema and all are cur-
rently represented or will be rep-
resented by works “in the very
near future. The latest George

-. Stevens project is his magnum

opus, “The Greatest Story Ever
Told.” Stevens is responsible for
such delights" as “Shane,” “A Place
in the Sun,” “The,Big Country,”

“and “Diary of Anne Frank.” It

will be very interesting to see
ho'v a master ﬁlm-maker uses his

talents to depict the revered story ’

of Christ, something that his yet
to be done well in past motion
pictureiventures. '

' Fred Zinnemaan gave us “High
Noon” and ‘,‘From Here to Eter-
nity.” He recently joined,forces
with such people as Gregory Peck,
Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif

to make somehting called ”Behold,f

a Pale Horse.” Since I am un-
familiar with this work I will
leave it to good tasteof Mr. Zin-
nemaan to present an exciting and

, thought-provoking motion picture
in the style that has made himi

tors in cinema circles today.

My favorite guiding light is
John Huston who is currently be-
hind the characters and cameras
in Mexico with an immense. job
on his hands. That job is “The
Night of the Iguuana,” his adap-
tation of Tennessee
brooding drama. Mr. Huston’s job

?f...:./is even more immense when you

consider the stars he is dealing
with: Richard Burton, Ave Gard-
ner, Deborah Kerr, and Sue Lyon.

This brings me to Otto Prem-
inger, who has made a habit of
creating controversy with every

ﬁlm he has made. Those ﬁlms
read like a who’s who listing from
the Hollywood Censor Bureau and
the Legion of Decency: “The Moon
is Blue,” “The Man with the
Golden Arm,” “Anatomy of _a
Murder,’’, and “Advise and Con-
sent.” To those themes of. sex,
drugs, and politics .have been
added that of religion. Mr. Prem-

inger has made the motion pic-.

ture version of Henry Morton Ro-
binson’s great bestseller of the
1950’s, “The Cardinal.” The ﬁlm

will be premiered in Boston in a_.

Week and I will lay eight to ﬁve
that the-director’s work will be

greeted with the same ‘highly
mixed critical reception that ‘has
followed his past endeavors.

I could have mentioned people
like Kramer, Wise, Wyler, Sturges,
Wyler and Frankenheimer. I could
also have included the greats of
the international cinema, namely,
Bergman, Kurosawa, DeSica,
Richardson, Truffaut and Torre
Nillson. They ‘are other_ stories
and I'wil1 present their coming
attractions at opportune times. As
long as the director is king of the
hill, I will praise his abilities and
pass them along to an interested
and eager movie and theatre-go-
ing public.

HOW SMALL CAN“ YOU GET?

Today let, us address ourselves to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a small
college than. at a large college?

To answer this‘ question it is necessary ﬁrst to deﬁne terms.
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some
say that in order to be’ called truly small, a college should have
an enrollment of not more thanefour students. -

'I-surely have no quarrel with this statementpa four-student

'college must unequivocally be called small. Indeed, I would
even call it intime if I knew what ilntinze meant. But I submit
there is_ such a thing as being too small. Take, for instance, a.
recent unfortunate event at Crimscott A and M.‘

Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant" valley nestled

between Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, was founded by

.15 4

A. and M. Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1625

, to escape the potato famine of l841.«As a result of their fore-

sight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for
_one single day of their lives—and mighty grateful they were!
One night, full of gratitude after a wholesome meal of French
fries, cottage fries, hash browns, and au gratin, they decided
to show their appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes
by endmving 3. college. But their generosity contained one
stipulation: the enrollment of the college must never exceed
four students. They felt that only by keeping the school this
small could each student be assured of the personalized atten-
tion, the camaraderie, the esprit, that is all too often lacking in
larger institutions of higher learning. - .

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one-Saturday'
a. few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a. football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football,

as you can well imagine, was something of a problem at Crim-

scott, what with only four undergraduates in the entire college.
It was easy enough to muster a backﬁeld, but to ﬁnd a good
line—or even a bad line—bafHed some of the most resourceful
coaching minds in the nation.

"Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious fate dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow—-in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
Woke up that morning with an impacted incisor. Wriehards,
the slotback, ﬂunked his taxidermy exam and was declared in-
eligible. Beerbohm-Tree, the winigback-tailback, got his neck-
tie caught in his espresso machine. Yuld, the fullback, was
stolen by gypsies. G

Consequently, none of the Crimscott teamlshowed up at the
football game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to
score almost at Will. Crimscott was so cross after this humiliating
defeat that they immediately broke off football relations with
Minnesota, its tradtional rival. This later became known as
the Sacco-Vanzetti Case.

Soyou can see how only four students might be too meagre _

an enrollment. The number that I personally favor is twenty.
Why? you ask. Because, I reply, when you have twenty
students and one of them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes,

' there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one has

to be deprived of Marlboro’s ﬂavor, of Marlboro’s ﬁlter, of

Mar1boro’s staunch and steadfast companionship, and as a ‘

result you have a. student body that is brimming with sweet

content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness

and soft pack and Flip-Top box. '
'That’s why. .

O 1963 Max Shulma.
* * ' *

There are twenty fine cigarettes in every pack of Marlboros,
and there are millions of packs of Marlboros in every one of
the ﬁfty states of the Union. ,We, the makers of Marlboro and
the sponsors of this column, hope you will try our wares soon.

i n a t i on
on campus.
T h e L.A.
Cabinet —
the older of
the two — has already begun
‘its in'vestigations"into the sub-
ject of distribution courses‘ and
the professors who teach them.
‘Working hand in hand with
,7'ZDr. Albert Martin, dean of-.,(the
school of liberal arts, the Cab-
inet has already been able to-
oust one objectionable instruc-
tor and has forced another to
revamp his teaching methods.
The new appeals board, how-

, ;"' ever, has not yet had the same

opportunity to demonstrate its
ability to administer justice in
those areaswhere discrimina-
tion exists, but judging—fr0m
the quality people who are
mpembersof the board, there

can be little doubt that the»

committee ‘will be able toldo a
ﬁne job evaluating the issues
brought up before it.

Dr. Alan C.‘ Rankin, assist— _l

ant chancellor for student -and
general affairs, believes that
“there is no discrimination on
campus,” neither ofﬁcially nor
on a personal level. However,
‘the committee “will be one
way to solve people constantly
alleging ‘discrimination ~-
we’ll investigate and if it ex-
ists, we’ll take care of it.”
Regarding the L.A. Cabinet,
Dean Martin has stated-‘- that
"it “can give a lot of service.
They are a responsible and
concerned group. I expect
much good to come out of the
cabinet.” -

However, Dean Martin has
also stipulated that the group

should be concerned with the
.quality of the courses and their
construction and not with the
personalities of the instructors
involved.

Compare this last statement
with Dr. Rankin’s belief that

there is no discrimination on
campus to speak of, and you

"are faced with an interesting"

situation._ ~
Both Dean Martin and Dr.
Rankin share a fear, however
slight, that unless the new
boards are extremely careful,
.things could get rather out of
hand. And I am forced to
agree with them to some de-
gree. ’ 

-Many of the’ outspoken,
though not necessarily respon-
sible students on campus, will

view the formation of these

complaint boards as an invi-
tation to a whole sale purge
of the faculty and administra-
tion. t ,

Certainly, there are bad in-
structors and bad courses.of-
fered for student consumption
in -this University, and possi-
ble there is discrimination of
some sort practiced on, campus
(though I have as yet seen

' no solid proof of it), but I be-
lieve that it is not __as serious
as the formation of these com-
mittees would lead students to
believe. .

some others are criticized for

ly I had occasion to belong ‘to
the latter group.‘ However, I
am thankful to my critics for
giving me an opportunity to
clarify my view on the issue.
In the “International Week”
forum on “The Image of, Amer-

these (referring to Cuba and
Viet Nam) are," apt -to give
strength’ to the enemy’s criti-

minor amendment to the news

was not made.in reference to
India but in reference to the

Smizik showed how accurate
his second hand information is.
He praises the students who

   Balanced Backfield;

Massive Front Line

There’s no Jimmy Brown ..or Ernie Davis on the Syracuse
team.this year, but coach Ben -Schwartzwalder has come up
with an_assortment of backs, who, although not of the Brown-
Davis mold, are playing more than respectable ball and have
been one of the main reasons for Syracuse's 5-1 record.

The backs‘ are led by quarterback Walley_Mahle, who is no
more than an average passer, but an outstanding rusher. Mahle

. leads the Orange with 360 yards gained for a 5.9 yard average.

If. the Orange need passing Schwartzwalder is more likely

beck, “King had not‘ done too
much until the Oregon State

game, but against them he

Beat Penn State

Mahle, and lately King,
have been big cogs in the
Orange attack that has led
them to wins over Boston Col-
lege, Holy Cross, UCLA, Penn
State and Oregon State. The
impressive 31-7 win last Sat-
urday over Oregon State put
the Orange into the tenth-spot

WALLEY MAHLE tional football ratings.
.Backing up Mahle andvKing will be halfbacks Billy
,AHunter and Mike Koski and fullback Bill Schoonover. Each

has a better than ﬁve yard rushing average.

Schoonover is a replacement for Jim“ Nance, the NCAA
wrestling champ ‘and regular. fullback, who has been out since
the Penn State game with a headinjury. Nance is deﬁnitely
out for tomorrow’s contest. , /
4 - Line Has Improved‘ ‘ .

The Syracuse line has also been doing its share in the
Orange success. The line has improved so much over last year
that two regulars from the 1962 squad are on the bench this year.

One of the linemen is Jim Mazurek, the Orange co-

captain, who started at guard last year, but has been rele-

— gated to the second unit this season. John Paglio, a regular
tackle in 1962, is now a second-unit guard.

 

The man who Pinchbeck calls “our best ballplayer” is not '

listed in the Orange starting lineup. Pinchbeck was referring to
linebacker Ed Conti, who has been'credited with 81 tackles in
the six Syracuse games so far. He has led the team in tackles
every game. I 3

Syracuse will be working out of an unbalanced line tomor-
row which has two tackles on one side of the ball. The Orange
line averages 222 pounds and was called by, one exaggerating
newspaper as “bigger than the Green Bay Packers.”

With four talented ball carriers in the starting lineup, the
Orange are expected to stick mostly to the ground and try to
move behind their massive‘ forward wall. If they go to passing.
chances are King will see plenty of action.

e  Schwartzwalder Big Success

  

  

Syracuse football coach Ben
Schwartzwalder, now in his 15th
season as head coach of the
Orangemen, has compiled an out-
standing 91-43-2 record while
handling the head coaching duties
at Syracuse. -

A graduate of West Virginia
University in 1933, Schwartz-
walder has had only one losing
season at Syracuse, in 1949 his
ﬁrst year at the helm. Since that
time he has compiled as enviable
a record as any coach in the East.

Schwartzwalder coached teams
have captured the Lamb ert
Trophy in 1952, 1956 and 1959.

in'1952, 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1961.

 Hawks Host
Chickens

Tomorrow

Football will be put back a good
20 years Saturday at Schenley
Oval when The Pitt News Hawks
take on the unbeaten Syracuse
Daily Orange Cnickens in the ﬁrst
annual Orange Bowl at .10 a.m1.

The Chickens hold a 12-0 win
over Penn State and lead the
Eastern Journalism Conference
(EJC) with a 1-0 mark.

The Hawks, however are
primed for an upset._ According
to coach Bob (Dietzel) Smizik,
“We can win this game with no
trouble if we can get one factor
going for us.‘ ‘

Great Passer

“That factor is one of the coun-
.try’s truly great passers, Vijay
Jain. Fans probably know him as
the ‘Bombay Bullet.’ But believe
me, if he plays the Chickens don’t
have a chance.”

If Jain can not play_ (he missi-
ed the entire 1962-season due to
a severe case of dandruff)’ the
Hawks will have tovrely on‘Jim
“Juggernaut” O’Brien.‘
the country over for his inept
passing and slow running, “Jug-

gernaut” will have to ﬁll in for I

Jain if the “Bullet” can’t play.

Teaming up with either Jain or
O’Brien will be halfbacks Fred
“Big Daddy” Berlin and Stan
“Long Gone” Stein. _

The end position is still up for
grabs (according to Smizik. “I
don’t know whether to use Art
“Skip” Fleischner, Frank “Pep”
Smizik or Bob ‘f,Mad Dog” ,Wish-
nev,” the coach said. “However, no’
matter which one starts I know [I
can count on an equally lousy
game from any of them.” _

Ralph “Speedy” Albright will
hold down the center post for
the Hawks. "

Others to see action for the"
Hawks are Pat “Chicken” Pollino, ‘

Matt “Phathead” Swetonic, Don
“Yellow” Friedman, and Al “Rail~

I bird” Blumkin.

Marvin “Crazy-legs” Zelkowitz
will act as team "manager (water-_
boy) since he will not be able to
play due to a severe lack of
ability.

Can it be you never listen to my

Is it conceivable that what

I took to be a solid foundation

That‘ what I thought was a
