Violence marks Hot Dog Shop disputes

°OrigiI1al’ strike persists

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Violence erupted Sunday between a striker and
the son of the owner of Oakland’s Original Hot Dog
Shop, where employees picketed against allegedly
unfair working conditions and demanded unioniza-
tion.

Owner Sid Simon said he was uncertain of what
followed the violence though a picketer, Mark Co-
hen, said he thought Simon's son,Bruce, had charged
assault and battery, and that the picketer. Mark
Tauve. was to file similar charges today.

Though both the elder Simon and the picketers
agree that there was some confrontation. they dis-
agree about the initiator of the violence. It is also
subject to debate whether an actual exchange of
blows occurred.

According to a picketer, Tauve was attacked from
behind and knocked to the ground, while Simon stat-

ed that violence first flared when his son was struck‘

in the mouth.

Simon further claimed that the protesters have
no right to picket. since "they don’t work here an_y-
more.“ He maintained that the picketers quit with-
out soliciting petitions for a union or haVingaPenn'-

sylvania Labor Relations Board election. Therefore,

he argued, the walkout constituted quitting. Seven of
the shop’s 17 employees participated in the walkout.

“It’s a boycott, not a strike,“ Simon contended.

However, Cohen declared that a number of work-
ers had earlier attempted to discuss the issues with
Simon, “and when we walked upstairs our time
cards were gone.”

He also said that the legality of the picketing had 

been verified through lawyers and union organizers.’

"We finally got fed up with it." remarked one
striker, citing crucial areas where the strikers feel
shop standards are indequate.

The workers’ grievances include: the deduction
of register shortages from their pockets; no vaca-
tions or sick leave; no free meals (food consumed
must be purchased); no work breaks; discrimina-
tory hiring practices; and “lousy pay.”

In addition, they claim that workers quitting or
f'ired before 30 days have elapsed are liable to have

’ a week’s pay withheld.

Simon denounced the charges as “a lie" and-

"ridiculous.” He said that at his present profits it
would be impossible to meet the pay scales the pro-
testers want.’

The workers have outlined $2 per hour to start,
with a 10 cents raise after each calendar month of
employment, until pay reaches $2.60 per hour.

According to Simon. workers begin at $1.60
under a merit system that brings the rate up to $2
after three months. '

"They don’t want a union." he added. “They just
have a hard-on for the Original Hot Dog Shop; they
want to close us down.”

3

"We need a union,’ announced a leaflet distri-
buted by strikers,outlining a list ofdemandsinclud-
ing the pay scales mentioned above. ten days of
paid sick leave per year (which Simon said he could
not afford), and ten minute breaks for every two
hours of work, in addition to the abolition of "un-
fair” practices.

SC approves strict allocations

policies to, prevent fund misuse

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Student Government'-~approv-
ed revisions in procedures for the
allocation of student activities
monies will make‘ misuse of funds
by student organizations difficult.

For the first time. student
groups receiving allocations will
be required to keep financial rec-
ords which shall be open to exam-
ination by the Allocations Com-
mittee and the Student Govern-
ment Board. Organizations will
also be required to present a rec-
ord of the past year’s expendi-
tures when applying for money.

The Allocations Committee re-
serves the right to recall or
freeze monies of an organization
if it finds discrepancies between
the group's proposed and actual

expenditures. The new policies,,'

however, give organizations the
right to a hearing with the A1.
locations Committee in case funds
are rescinded.

All student expenditures must
be approved by Bill Lenaghen. Stu-
dent Activities Specialist and fi-

‘nancial advisor to student organ-

izations. Previously. groups
were simply required to have the

  

signature of their club adviser on
disbursements.

But. according to Lenaghen.
most advisers didn't know exact-

" ly what the organization was do-

ing, and students often signed dis-
bursements themselves.

“The Allocations Commmittee
had no check on the club’s expen-
ditures except to go back into the
books afterwards,” Lenaghen
said. The new procedure should
“cut down on students’ idea that
organizations can spend money
in any way they want.”

The Allocations Committee has

also outlined new criteria for al-
locations eligibility. For instance.

I organizations of a public relations

nature—defined by Lenaghen as
such groups as the William Pitt
Debate Team and Heinz Chapel
Choir—will be expected to obtain
funds from other University
souces. As envisioned by the Al-
locations Committee, this may
mean that some organizations will
will be totally funded by the ad-
ministration.

"The Allocations Committee
wants ‘to see the University do
more for organizations that are
doing things for the University."
Lenaghen said. I F

 
 

A method of deciding whether a
club of an athletic nature should
receive student activities fees, al-
ways a matter of contention on
the Committee, has been better
defined. According to the new
code, if 75 per cent of the
schools against which the club
competes are funded by activities
fees, the Pitt club will also be
eligible. The burden of proof is
the responsibility of the club.

The code revisions were made
to “insure proper student check
on organization spending of stu-
dent funds," Lenaghen said. "Stu-

- dents should have a say "on what

happens to student money," he
added.

Lenaghen termed the allocations
code "strict.“ It places more re-
sponsibility on organizations," he
said. "I doubt many organizations
had books before."

Any student organization that
has been recognized by the Stu-
dent Government on Student Or-
ganizations is eligible to apply for
allocations.

Application f'orms can be pick-
ed up in 305 SU or 105 SU. Bud-_
get requests must_ be turned in by
March 20. I

Black Studies

major olcayed  

by SHARON SEXTON

\ At a recent meeting. College
of Arts and Sciences Council un-
animously approved the proposal
for a Black Studies major as pre-
sented by Dr. Jack Daniel, chair-

' man of the-Black Studies depart-

ment, and Curtiss'Porter of ‘the
same department.

According to the proposal, stu-
dents could choose their major
from four divisions: Black Social
Sciences, Black Humanities,
African Studies, and Caribbean
Studies.

‘ Each division. in turn. would be
divided into two or more concen-
trations. The major portion of the
students study would be devoted
to one concentration: a Black Hu-
manities major could concen-
trate in Black Art and Culture.
Black Literature, or Black Lan-

‘ guages.

A Black ‘Studies .major would
constitute 30 cred,its——12 from the
chosen concentration, six from
the other concentrations in the di-
vision, three credits from each of
‘the three subdivisions, and three
credits from any Black Studies
area.

Majors are also encouraged to
take related courses in such de-
partments as Political Science
and Economics. Porter indicated
that the department would prefer
a second major as opposed to a
minor in the related field.

In their written rationale, Por-
ter and Daniel explain the func
tion of Black Studies: "Black
Studies must project a future for
black people. For the black peo-
ple who are enmeshed in an ex-
ploitive system, this projection
must begin with an analysis of
that entrapment and move on pro-
ductively to concrete alternatives
in thought and action. “Black ed-
ucation professes to provide the

The Office of Student Affairs.

‘in conjunction with the Chancel-

lor's office has drafted a propos-
al outlining the conditions under
which the University will bring
the Intercultural House under
its administrative umbrella.

The proposal, according to Dr.
Alfred Moye. Dean of Student Af-
fairs, will be sent to John Tyler,
founder of the Intercultural House.
Meetings with the policy board of
the House will be held to discuss
the details.

According to Moye, the proposal
suggests permitting ' the Univer-
sity to lease the House from the
Gertrude Stein Foundation, which
currently finances the project.

Students who live in the House
would receive either free room
or free board. Tuition scholar-
ships would be based on demon-
strated financial need.

At present members of the
House receive full room. board,
and tuition grants.

If the University administers
the project to a greater degree. it

might be’ subject "to charges of .

student of Black Studies with the
perception,’ the mental facility,
plus the academic and philosophi-
cal tools forcontinuing the devel-
opment of alternative systems.“

Asregards the validity of a ma-
jor in Black Studies, “the grad-

uate Black Studies major will be‘ .

prepared. to survive, continue
studying, work, create works for
the black communities in this na- '

tion and wherever his experience i

should take him in the world.
Clearly the most important asset
of the Black Studies graduate will
be the insight of action and crea-
tion of a black independent fu-
ture.” ‘

The only major objection to the
program was raised by Dean Jer-
ome Schneewind, who expressed
concern that the above passages
“might suggest to the average un-
dergraduate reader that the pro-
gram is designed for black stu-
dents only.”

Schneewind objected to several A
other paragraphs which he found
"do not clearly exclude white stu-
dents but seem to be directed to-

ward black students.” Continuing, ,

he said. "As I see the contribution
that Black Studies can make to
white undergraduate education
is far more
seems to be indicated in this pro-
posalf‘

Porter agreed that several pass-
ages could be altered to specifi-
cally include white students. He
also strongly stressed that “Black
Studies has a priority for black
students which we will not ig-
nore.” He added, “Within this
priority we do recognize our re-
sponsibility to white students.”

Porter said that a paragraph
would be included in the outline
which would “say something
about the "difference in benefits
to be derived from black and
white Black Studies majors.”

discrimination against women,
since no women live at the House
and there is no comparable wom-
en‘sfacility. 1“

Tyler stated that the original“ '» .

aims of the project included pro-
visions for a coed facility, but the
physical structure of the House
made this difficult.

A statement drafted several
months ago by the Advisory Coun-
cil on Women’s Opportunities
(ACWO) regarding the Intercul-

. tural House called it a discrimin- -

atory project.

"The Advisory Council on Wom-
en's Opportunities,” reads the
statement, “is opposed to any
University support —— financial,

structural, or moral of any pro- /‘

ject, such as the Intercultural
House. which discriminates
against women’.’

Moye stated that it would be im- S

possible for the House to become
coed immediately, due to the cir-
cumstances of the project's adop-
tion-, but it is hoped that the prob-

.lem can be rectified within two

years.

‘ After Federal_Judge Herbert P.

“From here,” Braden said, “we
wait and a panel of judges re-
views the decision, deciding if
Judge Sorg will have to hear the
case.”

Sorg’s decision was based on
his interpretation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1966. the law which
Braden is claiming the Universi-
ty has violated. His ruling states
that the act covers discrimination
by race only.

The charges which Braden has
filed involve discrimination
against women in the University

asa class in hiring practices, pro-I

motion discrepancies, and dis-
missal of women interested in se-
curing equality of employment.

Although Braden expects the
judicial review to be a lengthy
proceeding, she has considered
the_future of the’case.

“If the panel of judges decide
that Judge Sorg should hear the
case,” she said, "it will be re-
turned to him. If not, we will have
to get another case.”

Dakota is looking for workers
who are interested in giving of
themselves in exchange for room,
board, and transportation to and

from the Sioux Indian Reservation.

The project will last from June
18-Aug. 20. Those interested can

Symposium covers the occult

Miniskirted” witches crafty  

by LINDA SAVAGE

A blond. miniskirted woman.
Therise Perry speaks softly into
the microphone, "I was born a
witch,“ she says.

A second speaker, Dr] Mirta
Mulhare, outlines the origin and
development of witchcraft, but
cautions, “Much more goes on in
the minds of men in witchcraft

than actually goes on in witch-'

craft."

These two women presented the
introductory session in a two-day
symposium on witchcraft entitled
"Kab’bala.”

Mulhare, anthropologist at Car-
low College and Western Psychia-
tric Institute gave an overview
of the historical perspective of

"witchcraft.

Perry, a student and practition-
er of the occult and witchcraft,
led a ‘discussion on witchcraft
and her involvement in it.

Mulhare, who wrote her docto-
el thesis on comparative witch-
craft, traced its beginnings back
to early mankind.

“Witchcraft and magic are in-
herent parts of a social system,”
she said, “necessary because of
man’s need to transcend his ani-
mal manifestations.”

Today, in our scientific society,
she said, when someone experi-
ences misfortune we call it bad
luck, but other societies attribute
it to witchcraft.

g , y MULHARE
Daughter-in-laws Revenge

“Where science could not pro-
vide answers, witchcraft was
left,”- said Mulhare.

According to Mulhare’s studies,
the charge of witchcraft was also

used as a social control in place’

of laws and punishment. Order,

An emergency injunction order-
ing the reinstatement of Joe Acan-
fora until his plea can be judged
was issued after. he filed suit
against. the State College School
District for violation of his con-
stitutional rights.

According to Attorney Lenny
Sharon of the Pittsburgh Law
Commune, Acanforas teaching du-

ties will be completed by the time _,
his case is heard. However, Shar- g
on said Acanfora will continue to ‘-

seek expungement of his dismiss-
al from his school records and
nominal damages for the "stig-
ma” the dismissal placed on his
reputation‘. —
_A__ganfora was dismissed three

ing whoever misbehaved with ac-
cusation of being a witch and pos-
sible burning at the stake.

_ In family relations, she said. it
also served as a social control. In
one African tribe, noted Mulhare,
70 per cent of the witchcraft prac-
ticed was directed at mothers-in-
laws by their daughters-in-law.

Perry described witchcraft as
"having influence upon yourself
and people around you to some ex-
tent.” From witchcraft she claims
she has gained an internal har-
mony.

Perry said she uses mainly her
good powers and relies on her neg-

-ative powers only for defense.

"Knowledge is protection, pow-
er, and wisdom,” ‘said Perry.

Active in a coven and as an ex-
orcist, Perry has been develop-
ing her powers since birth.

“A coven is formed for people

binding together for a linking of
minds,” she said. “One individual

can do much but you take a group-

of like minds and the results are
very good.”

Perry was recently called upon
to get rid of a spirit in the old Al-
legheny‘Workhouse. Another exor-
cism she is particularly proud of
was prescribed by a physician.

days after he filed suit against

Penn State as a plaintiff for the
Homophiles of Penn State (HOP).

Though Acanfora, a declared
homosexual, was told there had
not been any complaints to date
about his performance at a local
junior high, the school anticipated
them, Sharonrelated.

At a press conference, John
Miller. solicitor for the State Col-
lege Area School District. said:

“The publically announced ob-
jectives of the organization of
which Joseph Acanfora is a mem-
ber are not compatible with the
education policies of the public

- school.”

Acanfora remains a plaintiff in
the HOPS case, which is pending.

Miller recital yields   scholirirshipll    

but bears little artistic fruit  ,1 I

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Entertainment Editor

Benefit recitals are usually well attended be-
cause of their lofty purpose and this past week's
Mildred Miller program at Carnegie Music Hall
was no exception.

The noble intention of our local mezzo-soprano
of the Metropolitan Opera in setting up a music
scholarship in her name at the University bore
much fruit monetarily although the yield artistical-
ly proved much smaller.

Miller, well known here for her roles in Carmen
and Rosenkavalier, has had many distinctions as-
sociated with her name: 20 years with the Met, a
Grand Prix du Disque, and even a full length film,
The Merry Wives of Windsor._ Many baseball fans
will also remember that it was she who sang the
National Anthem at the first World Series night
game last October.

‘While Miller’s voice is not astrong one, her earn-
est thoughtfulness for every note she sings makes

ed quite succinct, especially in comparison to her‘

English which was not quite as satisfactory. Such
pronunciation, in addition to her gestures, added
much to the nature of the songs.

One important aspect about Miller’s presenta-
tion is her “stage presence.” Despite an insensitive
accompanist and other problems, there was no
doubt that she commanded respect by her graceful
attitude on stage. This was especially evident in her
words of gratitude at the end of the program.

Due to Mildred Miller’s concern, the music de-
partment now has a scholarship. The preparations
for this recital’ were many and the program was in-
deed for a worthy cause. Even so, the musical
quality of this performance was not fully satisfying,
especially in the context of past recitals by other

artists. A shorter program with more thoughtful

and suitable selections could have proven more
rewarding both for the audience and for the ar-
tists involved.

Lyric analysis    
annoys McLean

by SUE HOENSTINE A
During his concert Thursday Don McLean was detached from his

audience only by distance.

But after the house lights went on and after he signed autographs
for about 80 high school girls, the creator of American Pie let the ef-
fects of being on the road for three months show.

He slouched back in a folding chair and responded slowly to ev-

‘_ ; ery question. It was like talking to a college student the morning after

he studied for two finals and wrote a paper. .
“I guess you could call me a loner, it makes good press,” he said.

I ' “But I wouldn’t call myself a poet. I don’t consider myself to be much

of anything but someone who is trying to stay alive.”

With a head of dark, bushy hair, round cheeks, and the legs of his
jeans stuffed into knee-high boots McLean looked more like a farmboy

  than a 26 year old musician from New Rochelle.

Evenwhen he leaned forward to tell me about American Pie, I
couldn’t verify the color of his eyes. They’re set deeply, shadowed by

a squarish forehead, and "never opened wide enough for.the whites to‘

show.

“There are innumerable connections. you can make between a per-
son and his works. For me the whole album (American Pie) was sym-
bolic of my own death. But I'm way beyond that now,”

He likeneda song to a person and said that “today people are just

too hung up on interpreting things.”

“A song is a mixing of experiences,” he mused. "It has a life of

so incredibly stupid.”

i t . its own and a variety of meanings. To try and base it on one idea is just

Some listeners have interpreted McLean’s American Pie to be
an allegory on the rock and roll era. Although the singer wouldn’t
comment on this interpretation, he called the ?50’s “an important seg-

. ment” in his life. “I was about 10 at the time, and fascinated by rock

and roll. I still love the Coasters, the Drifters, and, of course, Budd

Holly.”

When I asked him how it felt to become a celebrity after being vir-
tually unknown he rubbed his chin. looked past me and only replied,

“It does weird things to your mind.”

. Although McLean wouldn’t specify his musical plans, American
Pie may be his last solo effort. He mentioned that he would like to test

 - his abilities with an electric guitar and with other musicians.

“After this road-trip is over I might get away from solo work.
It would be somewhat of an experiment,’.’ McLean remarked.

cations for the Vira Heinz
Award casts a dark shadow on the
entire foreign scholarship idea at
this University.

Page
A of
Opinion

       

From my own findings, it would
seem that this award was only re-_
cently attached to the scholar-
ship program after over 20 years
of existence.

At its inception, this award was
evidently molded to the liking of
the Dean of Women Students to
be bestowed upon whomever
she and her “committee” felt
should receive it.‘ With her retire-
ment. the award’s custody quick-
ly was transferred to the Dean’s
friend, the Director of Program-
ming for Heinz Chapel. After all,
both these women were friends
of Mrs. Heinz, but was that the
reason enough that they be the
custodians of this award?

Now as the latest “protec-
tor” of the award prepares to
retire, the award finally has
come to rest where it should have
some time ago, the Office of Cul-
tural and Educational Exchange.

Since the award was now part
of the Cultural Exchange Office,
I visited its director to ask wheth-
er I was indeed eligible to apply
for this award. She replied that I
most certainly was.

The Director of Programming
felt quite differently on the mat-
ter, however, and informed me

American pie 2'; la mode

Prophet offers bittersweet dirges

by LYNNE WINSTEN

Armed with only a -microphone to fendoff at-
tacks from hostile hecklers, Lenny Klavonic _ad-
vanced to center stage at Soldier’s and Sailor's
Memorial . . . "and it’s part of the contract that we
rise for the pledge of allegiance.” Shuffling to at-
tention, the audience slouched in silence (devotion
or protest?) towards the limp American flag.

"That’s some opening act." quipped Don Mc-
Lean, as he tuned his guitar.

. "Don‘t laugh,” he added ironically. "It's the big-
gest act in the world."

And that was what he sang about. Don McLean,
new prophet of hope and doom . . . resurrecting mu-
sic in a hall dedicated to dead men in a country
where “the dying are born and the lving are dead,”
and beseeching, “Can music save your moral soul?”

It wasa musical version of the Last Supper with
American Pie for dessert. And the audience ate it
up. There were bitter songs about man’s destruc-
tive greed, and we tasted the salty.tear's of tragedy
and comedy _as “we wept by the waters of Baby-
ion,” and laughed about poor "Gordy."’ who couldn’t
get his“pen«ker” out of the "kundy.” in a bawdy

English ballad. (Sorry folks——McLean doesn’t like
lyric interpreters, so you figure it out.)

 

In fact, one of his songs takesthe interpreter
down the "Amazon” of alliteration. where he is
devoured by the monsters of his imagination. as
“prophylactics prowl” and “hypodermics howl."

I

McLean proved himself amazingly versatile.
American Pie is not his only specialty. Although
many of his songs» were haunting dirges, like the
beautiful Vincent (an ode to Van Gogh), others pre-‘
sented the sugar coated‘ side of cynicism, as in,
“And her mother came to(o).” Besides guitar, he
also plays some footstompin’ banjo. ’

whom to believe. Finally, the

rather in advance of that date, and

Best of all, everything was seasoned to taste;
McLean had no rigidly planned program. He just
went ahead with what he sensed the audience would
respond to. Although he encouraged audience par-
ticipation, most people were content with passive
consumption. —

The concert closed with an extra ‘helping of
American pie, and McLean received an enthusiastic
standing ovation (or was that a pledge of allegi-
ance?).

Bureaucracy frustrates grant applicant

 

Cultural Exchange Director
bowed to the negative decision
of the Programming Director.
Who was at the bottom of this
scholarship anyway? i

Upon being refused the written

«qualifications for this award at
_ the same time that I was refused

the opportunity to apply, I
wrote to the donor of the scholar-
ship. Not _receiving an answer
from her on the matter, I was re-
ferred to the Director of Pro-
gramming for Heinz Chapel Mrs.
Heinz no longer has anything to
do with this award, I was told.

In the ensuing situation I was
also told that, in effect, I really
had not right to write to Mrs.
Heinz. The hope‘ of seeing the
award’s written qualifications
was now evidently crushed as
well.

How regrettable it is that the
Heinz name and its integrity must
be questioned by the donor’s atti-
tude toward this scholarship. Cer-

tainly Mrs. Heinz has some con- 

cern for the way her money is
being spent. While the fav-
orites of her friends have been
sent to Europe on her money,
other students deserving of
the opportunity can only sit by and
watch.

When making out my applica-
tions, the Dean of the College's
office demanded my advisor’s
signature when I already had the
approval of a faculty member.
The scholarship office denied

any need for an advisor’s signa- '

ture, but the Dean's office practi-
cally demanded that the signa-

, ture be on the application before
_the program could be approved.

Appointments for interviews
were not madegon the. date set but

.-I

I was left with an appointment
time when I could not appear, due‘
to a previous University commit-

’ ment. Two days of begging were

required before my time iwas
changed. Finally the announce-
ment date for the winners was
changed quite casually from the
previous date given with no really
valid ‘reason. '

Even is this\were the only pro-

blem connected with the program,_

it would be enough. There were,
however, other problems as well.

All of these irregularities re-
flect the program’s consistent
lack» of integrity as far as proce-
dures areconcerned.

While I have received word
from an Assistant.to the Chancel-

lor that my complaints will very
definitely be considered and that
something will be done about
them, I have my doubts as to
whether any of this will really be
rectified in the end.

The long history which shows
that the Heinz Award really
stands for and my recent experi-
ences with this particular award
and the entire foreign scholarship
program cause me to believe that
things will remain much the way
they stand now. '

If this be the case, how much
longer can this university expect

"Truth and Virtue” to remain as ‘

its motto when its foreign schol-

arship program dares to include
itself as a contributor to the at--

tainment of that motto?

Some of the artists have made noteworthy ap-

_ pearances before on the Foster stage. For example,
his many friends will remember Bert Nemitz, noted .

character actor of great versatility, who created a

sensation when he emerged from his bathtub as ,

Marat in Marat/Sade. -

He will be seen in the remarkable role of Adam
Truman, a noble farmer from Catteraugus, N. Y.,
whose sterling ideals of honesty, thrift, and truth-
fulness turn the tables on the pretentious.insincere
parasites of the metropolis who live only for pleas-
ure.

In the company is also Mary Jacobs Ford. a
favorite with local audiences for the rendering of
such parts as Killer in The Time of Your Life and
Mommy in The American Dream. She will appear
as Mrs. Anthony Tiffany, whose extravagant tastes
lead her abused husband (Mark Huberman) to the
very brink of disaster.

The large cast of characters includes Count Joli-
maiture, a fashionable. European import, played by
James Berry; Joseph Snobson, a rascally scoun-
drel, played by Henry Luba; Colonel Howard, acted
by Dennis Grossman; the sweet little music teach-
er. Gertrude, whose true identity is not revealed un-
til the sensational finale, played by Kate Hauck;
and the attractive French Maid who harbors afa-
tal secret, portrayed by Francine Nemitz.

These artists, together with many other dazzling
performers, dancers, and singers all appear in this
famous American classic.

Featured in the production is the dancing of
“Daring La Polka” by the entire company, and 10
musical numbers by the more gifted members of
the troupe. Songs include Why Did They Dig Ma’st
Grave So Deep? sung by a selected sextet, The
Gypsy’s Warning, a timely footnbte on the dangers
a working-girl must face, I Wish I Was Single Again,
Walking Down Broadway and others.

This theater piece, it is rumored,will move many
to laughter and to tears. The box office at Stephen

In X, Y, and Zee, Elizabeth Tay-
again gets the chance to play a
role she has become increasingly
identified with since Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf.—that of the
overly possessive and vile-mouth-
ed wife. '

While she still may be consider-

_ed an-actress with exceptional

abilities, it is shameful that her
talents have been wasted on this
trite and superficial film.

As Zee, her marriage to Robert
(Michael Caine‘) is anything but
happy. It is built on jealously, hate,
and -mistrust. Robert revels in in-
curring his wife’s wrath by flirt-
ing with any woman who attracts
him. Masochistically, he enjoys
Zee’s verbal flagellations. They
fill an emotional gap caused by
the belief that no one actually
cares about him.

Likewise, Zee accepts her hus-

band’s adulterous behavior as a‘

compliment. While. he continues
to have different affairs, he al-
ways comes back to his “baby.”

This arrangement manages
somehow to survive until Robert
meets Stella (Susannah York).
Dismissed at first by Zee as a
“slob with soul,” Stella soon be-
comes very‘ seriously involved
with Robert.

Thus, fearing that her husband
will desert her. Zee goes into ac-

 Virginia
hams

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports’ Editor

I :" ’ "Oh, you always say that when Pitt, loses.”

Whenl found myself in a similar conversation after return-
7 ing from Virginia last week, Irealized the pointlessness of car-
" rying the discussion any further. Unless you were present in

_ night, it would be difficult to understand the situation.

Panther Coach Buzz Ridl refused to comment publicly on
the officiating, and WTAE radio announcer Bill Hillgrove ad-
mitted that he came “perilously close to using the word ‘homer’
for the first time in his radio career.”

To me, getting homered sounded a bit too polite.

A - Throughout the first half, it seemed like the split crew of
ECAC ref Cliff Fair and ACC ref Lou«Moser would be able to

 I withstand the unbelievable pressure of the crowd. But, halfway -
 through the second half, Moser assessed his second tec‘hnicali;'

“ ‘ the one which precipitated the ensuing travesty.

5 Lg Though Ridl was talking to Fair, Moser blew the technical
.» ‘while stationed on the other side of the court. Fair even ques-
,‘ tioned Moser’s authority on the call, as the two argued at cen-
- ' ter court.

A. Moments later, Fair reciprocated with a;rivial technical
 .-(improper hand raising) on Virginia to even things. At. that
 5 point, I had hoped that Moser would feel his two technicals had
 been balanced out. Conversely, with the score tied at 70, Mos-
.;er bettered Fair’s efforts by calling a hand raising technical of
hisown and topped it off with another needless one moments
 later.

~ 9 Yet no technical was levied by Moser when Chip Miller (in-
 cidentally the best ‘free throw shooter for Virginia) shot a one
E4’ on one foul for Frank DeWitt (that’s right—~he’s the worst per-
. , centageshooter for the Cavs).

__ ' " , The cagers weren't the only ones homered at Virginia. Mrs.
 . Ridl was given a complimentary ticket, normal protocal be-
 tween competing schools. Her horrendous vantage point turned
, out to be at the extreme top of the Coliseum on a small wooden
V ,-{bench behind all of the permanent seats.

, J .Additionally, WPGH Sports Director Ed Rose and I were
_ reprimanded by Virginiapsports Information Director Barney

 

  

  

‘d.Cooke for cheering for Pitt at the Press table. When Rose re-v

-- minded Cooke of his own exclamation moments earlier to ref-

eree Cliff Fair (“Get off the court you dirty old man.” ), the SID
 graciously replied, “I’m in charge here, I make the rules and I
 ’[_'can‘say whatlwant.” ‘ ’ .
_ ' ..In retrospect, the thing that irritated me most was that the
y _ Virginia partisans all believed that Virginia and not Pitt had
“ r been homered. I pointed out to a group of Cavalier supporters
 that we had suffered four technicals. One student wisely retort-
 ed, “Yeh, but we had one so that evened it out.”

It's not hard to understand why so many Western Pennsyl-
.vania stars are deserting to the ACC for their cage careers. Fan
1,. T support is unbelievable—signs.hung everywhere and the sell-
X -‘_0I.lt crowd responded with tumultuous standing ovations for the
coaches and players.

 Assuredly, Ridl and the Panthers will be sky-high for next
' year’s ‘game here at Pitt. Hopefully, the Cats will just have the
.«Cavaliers to battle then. _  , _.-- _ _

» PHILADELPHIA — With Kevin
Love capturing Pitt’s first
EIWA title in three years,'the
matmen tallied 59 points to place
fifth in the 68th annual Easterns
at Temple University over the

. weekend.

Navy garnered the team cham-
pionship with 92 points. Penn
State, Lehigh, and Princeton also
finished ahead of the Panthers,
with 881/2, 6371/2, and 591/2 points,
respectively.

The Middies and. the Nittany
Lions waged a neck-and-neck bat-
tle for first place throughout the
tournament. Andy Tolk’s (Navy)
controversial 7-6 triumph over
PSU’s Bob Medina in the 134
pound finals proved to the mar-
gin of victory. .

Runnerup at 126 last year,
Franklin and Marshall’s Chris
Black was named the tourney’s
most outstanding wrestler as
well as copping his weight class
(126).

Tom Schuler (118) and Lloyd

won_ their third consecutive titles.
Keaser also received the Fletcher
Award, given to the wrestler who
has contributed the most.Eastern
points for his squad during his ca-
reer.

Dominating all four of his op-
ponents, Love pinned three of his

(foes, notching his quickest fall in

the finals against Navy’s Ross
Chaffin with a pipe wrench and
stack-.up.

Seeded second, Love was award-

ed the Billy Sheridan trophy for

the most falls (three) in the least
amount of time (5:37). A

In addition to Love, John “Bim-
bo” Chatman (158), Jim Fleming
(167), and Craig Tritch (190) all
finished fourth or better, 'thus
qualifying for the NCAA tourna-
ment at Maryland, March 9-11.

Heavyweight George Calcag-
nini (fifth) was the only other Pitt
grappler to place.

Leading 6-0 midway through the
period in the finals against Yale’s
Alan Gaby, Chatman wilted in the
final three minutes under Gaby’s

comeback and a questionable

stalling penalty, and lost, 7-6.

After suffering a slight concu-
sion in a quarterfinal bout loss
(13-3) to Cornell’s Rick Craw-
ford, Fleming fought back through
the consolation bracket to place
third. Fleming was fourth at 158

in the 1971 Easffernsjf’  ._ ,
'I_‘_ritch_, like Fleming, came back

pingthe old mark set by the Uni-
versity of Maryland in 1970 of
3:44.4.

Also, Muske covered the 200
yard backstroke with such rapid-

~ ity that there was no announce-

ment at the meet of his record
setting performance. His time of
2202.0 broke the old record held
by Wirth of North Carolina State
in 1965 of 2203.5.

Martin Staley’s inward and re-
verse dives just didn’t have it as

I he scored 218 points on both the

one and three meter diving
boards, just missing the Eastern
qualification mark of 220. He also
garnered Pitt’s other tainted first

season, Craig avenged a 2-2 tie
with Temple’s Roy Baker by hu-
miliating the Owl matman 11-2.

Extremely disappointed at fin-

ishing second, “Bimbo” mutter-
ed, “I know I had him (Gaby) pin-

‘ . ned in the second period. And that

stalling call. How can I shoot if
Gaby is pushing and slapping
me?”

Meanwhile, Love was exuberant
in triumph, and exclaimed, “It’s
been a long time. Being out a year
made me want this title very bad-
ly. Some people didn’t think I
could come back. I’m really look-
ing forward to wrestling in the
Nationals.”

Assistant Dick Slutzky was
pleased with the grapplers’ per-
formance. He indicated that Chat-

N1Tttmy

man would win his share of EIWA
championships and that PSU and
Navy are still one step above the
rest of the East.

Penn State will be sending six
grapplers to the NCAA tourney,
while the Middies qualified five
wrestlers. Pitt,‘ Princeton, and

Penn will each have four matment
competing in the Nationals. Al-
though F&M had three place-win— T
ners, these wrestlers must qual-
ity for the Nationals through the
small college tournament.

' Sports Editor '

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—The art of platooning, which has both .

specialized and completely revolutionized the sport of football _ has
apparently made its way to the basketball courts, perpetrated by none
other than the Pitt Panthers’ Head Coach Buzz Ridl.

While the Cats were humbling a tournament hopeful Nittany Lions

' squad, 78-70, in Rec Hall, Satur-

day night, Ridl was looking for
new combinations to keep his
team jelling. When the going got
rough, late in the second half, the
veteran mentor resorted to rotat-
ing Kent Scott and Ken Wagoner
every time the ball changed
hands. Both players seemed to
enjoy the jagged arrangement.

"Scott is the. better offensive
man and Wagoner the better de-
fensive man,” explained assis-
tant coach Fran Webster after the
game. “It’s only logical.” A

“I guess I’m the better foul
shooter in case we got fouled,”
mellowed Scott A who scored, 13
points for the cagers. The fact
that Billy Knight was the player
always fouled hardlyseemed to
affect the jubilant assembly.

Knight, who started offslow and
picked up momentum as the con-
test progressed, scored 25 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds. Having
a lot of trouble controlling the ball
in the" first half, due-partly to a
mauling defense played by the
Lions’ 6-7 junior Dan‘ Tarr, the

’ ;supe,r-soph.only_ had nine points in

that period. At times 6-7 Ed Chubb
and Chuck Crist, the Lions’ team

_ captain would collapse on Knight

as.he made his move to the bas-
ket.

A slow start, which found the
Cats scoreless for the first four
minutesgof the contest, almost
proved disasterous as the Staters
were able to jumb ahead 9-4. at
the 15:10 mark of the first half.
But some twine-ticklers from dis-’
tance by Mike Paul and Scott
quickly tied a score that seesawed
for the rest of the half. '

Lukewarm shooting (17-38) by
the Panthers balanced out a diluge
of turnovers (17) by PSU, al-
lowed Pitt to go into the dressing
room at halftime with a “39-37

.: 4-») "'7 .x. "E-9-..’ 7} L73l5 

The Cats snapped out of their
doldrums at precisely the same
time as Rid1’s insertion of Cleve
Edwards into the lineup. The 5-10
senior from Pittsburgh, who has-
n‘t seen any action lately, provid-
ed the spark the squad needed.
Both the coach and Edwards
agreed after the contest that it
was Cleve’s kind of game.

"Cleve picked us up right at the
start,” commented Ridl. "He
gave us some speed out there.”

Probably the most unsung hero
of the contest was Mike Paul. The
sandy-haired senior from. Bald-
win, Pa., himed in with 24 big
points, with seven of 10 from
the floor and a ‘perfect 10 for
10 from the charity stripe. Paul
also drew the thankless job of
guarding Lion sophomore Ron -
Brown, who scored 16 points for

' the losers.

Skaters clinch division

in 6-1 rompover C-MU  

by BART MACK

Phil Gefsky. Joe Testa. and Bill
Glanville each tallied goals with-
in a three minute span of the third
period to put the icing on the cake
as Pitt defeated Carnegie-Mellon,
6-1, to clinch the City Division
title last night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet.

Despite having to contend with
the C-MU skaters. the icers also
found themselves arguing with
the officials on several disputed

"calls. Three Pitt goals were dis-

allowed and several unusual pen-
alties were assesed to theskaters.
At the 5:18 mark of the first per-
iod defenseman Joe Testa receiv-
ed a five minute major penalty
for “intentionally kicking an op-

“If I would have kicked him
intentionally,” Testa laughed, “he
wouldn’t have been able to get up.”

Referee Joe Fontell discounted
Frank Williams’ two goals in the
second period claiming that his

V first score came after the whistle

to stop play. and the second,part
of an off-side pass.‘ A Pitt power-
play goal was also wiped out later
in the period.

Denny Browne opened the scor-
ing at the 1:18 mark of the first
period when he banged in a re-
bound amidst a pileup in front of
the C-MU_goal. Mike Kohl took a
perfect pass from Testa for the
only other goal of the first per-
iod. , -

Bryan McDonald scored for
C-MU early in the second period
but Dave Bahnson retaliated with
a Shorthanded goal at the 9:18
mark. Gefsky, Testa, and Glan-

ville then put the game out of
reach with their three goal bar-
rage in the last period.

Pitt now awaits the outcome of
the race for second place in the
City Division. Duquesne is cur-
rently in second place. with a 4-3-
1 record. C-MU is right behind
the Dukes sporting a 3-3 slate.

goals. Denny Browne had the only

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Tim Grgurich's Cubs traveled here Sat- I.-_'_7f”
urday night, but apparently forgot to bring their shooting eyes,la‘s well , 

/

as leaving Lady Luck back in Pittsburgh.

The Cubs. who outshot. outrebounded. forced more turnovers, out-__' 

stole, and had only three fewer
foul tries than the Lion frosh,
were amazingly out of the game
from the outset. ~

The Cubs’ downfall was a direct
result of the shobbiest half of
basketball they have played all
year—the first half. In that disas-
terous 20 minutes, the young
hoopers managed only 10 of 39
field goal tries’ and committed.
most of their turnovers.

While Pitt was shooting its
meager 22 per cent for the half,
the Lions, in the person of Randy
Meiser (21) and Kevin ,Burke
(10), were ripping the cords at a
red hot?58 per cent (16 of 29) and

also hit nine of 11 from the free '

throw line.

The ‘luckless Cubs found,the_ 

   

 

range in the second half,.and'— "’.~;'._°
while down by as many as 22 pts. 
fought back valiantly to cut the .,
score down to ten on two 'o’cca~«_" ' ‘

_sions, but to no avail.

Simpsoii, Neyltmd regain cage eligibility

Last week. the independent in-
tramural Black Flashes along
with the fraternity league Alpha
Phi Alpha were under considera-
tion for ineligiblity for further
basketball competition due to
illegal use of players.

The cagers, John Simpson and
Keith Neyland, have seen action
with both the Flashes along with
the Alpha squad. According to IM
rules, players are allowed to par-
ticipate on one team only.

-Usually teams violating this
rule are banished from further

competition.’ In the case of the
Alpha Phi Alpha squad, a special
meeting of the Inter-Fraternal
Council decided that the Alpha
team could continue to play if it
would replay a few of its previous
victories. -

The previous All-Campus Cham-
pions Black Flashes have also re-
ceived permission to continue to
play from a group of players rep-
resenting the first place teams in
each of the independent league’s
divisions. I
