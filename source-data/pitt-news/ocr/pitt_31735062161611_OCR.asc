Columbia Professor
Avers Faith In League
As War Preventative

By JOSEPH McCLOSKEY

Speaking before the partici-
pants in the University ’s annual
History Conference last Satur-
da"y,~Ja'me's Tr. Shotwell, of Co-
lumbia un'i'versit'y, Director of
the Carnegie Endowment for In-
ternational- Peace, reaffirmed his
belief in the League of Nations
idea, stating that he believed it
the only way for mankind to en-
dure in the modern world. '

In his speech, “Appraising the
History of the League of Nations,”
Professor Shotwell traced the at-
titude of mankind toward war
down through the ages and point-
ed out that genuine movements
for peace have materialized only
within the last century.

Now, advances in science, mak-
ing distance insigniﬁcant and send-
ing the nations of the world into
every corner of that world for raw
materials, he stated, have made
alternatives to war imperative.
Jingoism

Professor Shotwell went on to
point out that the failure of such
efforts for peace as the Washing-
ton Conference is due to a misun-
derstanding of the problem.

The representatives at that con-
ference were taken in by the slo-
gan, “The way to disarm is to dis-
arm,” according to the speaker,
with the result that an artiﬁcial
ratio of limitation was set up
which only encouraged the na-
tions of the world to build more
efficient ships so as to remain
within their limit without sacri-
ﬁcing strength.

The genuine path to disarma-
ment, the claimed, follows the slo-
gan, “The way to disarm is to re’-
duce the necessity for armaments,”
that is, to obtain security in other
ways. '

Professor Shotwell then went
on to explain the nature and ef-
fectiveness of the network of
treaties of arbitration and concil-
iation which pledge the nations of
Europe to submit their controver-
sies to conciliation before acting.

Arbitration Treaties

These treaties promote confer-
ence and compromise, and "avoid
arbitrary decisions by “disinter-
ested” tribunals. One outstanding
example was the Saar dispute be-
tween France‘ and Germany over
the number of “police” which
France should maintain in the
Saar.

Professor Shotwell concluded
his address by explaining the fail-
ure of the League in Manchuria.
He pointed out that Secretary
Stimson’s action in opposing the
investigation by the League com-
mitee left Japan free to take ad-
vantage of the split in the ranks
of the forces for peace. Thus
America‘ must share in the blame
for the failure of the League and
for the partition of China by Ja-
pan.

Now, as the nations of the world
cast about for some form of se--
curity, the League formula still
exists and, in Professor Shotwell’s
opinion, is still good.

Judge McBride Favors

Pre-Marriage Training

Inquiry Speaker
Treats Divorce a

Problem Monday

To reduce the growing number
of divorces and broken homes,
sch_ool -training for young people
in “problems of living together”
is necessary, ‘according to Judge
Lois "Mary "McBride, of Allegheny
county court, who addressed In-
quiry Forum Monday.

Terming the local Morals, De-
sertion and ‘Non-Support, and Di-
vorce courts as “courts to break
up homes," Judge McBride at-
tacked the present tendency to-
ward an increase in the number
of divorces, with its resultant ef-
fects on the lives of parents and
children.

“This awful increase in the
number of divorces is getting more
serious because married couples
have less economic security, must
live in closer groups, and have
more health and mental problems
to face,” said Judge McBride.

One of the factors which con-
tributes to the number of young

"people in penal institutions is the

growing list of divorces, the
speaker claimed.

“Children raised in a divided
home have nothing stable in their
lives,” she said. “They are the
children who are the problem
children. They have nothing left
to believe in, and can have no rev-
erence for their home.”

Laws regulating the granting of(

-marriage licenses should be made
more stringent, Judge McBride
declared. She cited weaknesses in
‘t"he'P'en'nsy1vania and West Vir-
ginia ’laws which allow persons to ,
obtain -licenses after answering
only a few simple questions with-
out confirmation of the facts.
“’I‘he‘marriage application does-
n't mean anything to many people,
who~«take it_ very casually. Then af-
ter we let people get married eas-_
ily, we make it easy for them to
get unmarried,” said Judge Mc-
Bride. '

Tracknien Go Outdoors

For Handicaps Meet

By BILL MAZEFSKY
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 :30 o’clock the Pitt‘ trackmen offi-
cially lift the curtain of the outdoor track season with the sixth
renewal of the Annual University Spring Handicap on the sta-

-dium cinders and turf.

.

Every trackman, varsity and freshman, will head» for the

tape with an even chance to win.

Of course some of the boys

“will have a handy start but this¢

is one track meet where it will be
hard to pick the winners in the
‘various events.

The top men in each event will
‘be scratched (still speaking ﬁgur-
-atively) and some of the handi-
-caps meted out will be big enough
‘to almost insure victory. Johnny
Woodruff will start in the half-
"mile and mile, and in the half-
mile willhave to ﬁght off leads
‘that range from 40 to 80 yards.
The leads in the mile, in some
cases, add up to 175 yards.

MASON " IN DASHES

Captain. Dick Mason faces hand-
icaps in the 100-yard dash that
:..scale from 1 to 5 yards and in the
220, Dick will have to give away
12 yards. Frank Ohl and Al Mc-
Kee, at scratch in the 440, will
"have to dash off a deﬁcit of 25
‘yards or lose the race.

Joe Newman, Henry and Bob
'iSulkowski will be scratched in the
120 high hurdles and 220 low hur-
«idles. Joe O’Heil, Clyde Graf, and
"Larry Katz will also run the 220
low hurdles from scratch.

The two-mile run will draw
more than usual interest. Talked
"up as one of the weak spots of the
‘team, and then discussed as a po-
tential strong link this meet may
help clear up the controversy--if
it be a controversy. Casimir Kopec
will ankle the two-mile jaunt
trailing his teammates by 75 yards
and up to 150 yards. Ben Kopec,
Al Zamborski, Walter Sterner,
Bob Cogswell, and Bill Nurmi, all
cross-country men, will offer Cas
competition.

BENKET AT SCRATCH

Pete Bjeﬁnet will give away 3,
4, 5, ands inche9,.ih.the.high jump.
Johnny Bayik will start at scratch
in the shot put and discus; The
shot putt deﬁcit will range up to
9 feet and the discuss disadvan-
tage reach to 25 feet.

Myles Radvansky will hurl the
javelin and will have to outhurl
his competitorsby 40 feet to win
the event. In the hammer Harry
Pomeroy will have to toss the

hammer 15 feet farther than any- ,

one to insure a victory.

The pole vault event will not go
"to George Clifton unless he over-
comes the 15-inch handicaps that
some of the other entries have.
Frank Ohl will try for a double
victory in. the broad jump, and to
win he will have to ﬁght off hand-
icaps that range up to 30 inches.

Pl-iaye1's’ Next
Show Will Go
Into Rehearsal

Work will bestarted shortly on
the Pitt Players’ production “Ac-
cent on You-th,,” according to Carl
Cass, director of the dramatic
group. The -'-Ssainuel Raph-aelson
show is  be presented in the
Stephen Foster theater Monday
.and:TiiesdaY, May 2 and 3.

Although utilizing only nine
players, two of ‘them in bit parts,
“Accent on Youth” will require a
variety of talents. It was given
on Broadway in 1934-, and re-
ceived so much acclaim that it
was immediately made into
movie.

In the movie version, Herbert
Marshali and Sylvia Sidney were
co-starred’ and immediately‘ were
hailed as stars. Constance Cum-
mings was starred in the Broad-
way show. Recently, the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse presented “Ac-
cent o'n,You‘t‘h.,”'_ their cast includ-
ing Stephanie Diamond, formerly

of _the Joe Penner show, and
Charles Roe, local ‘ radio an-.
nouncer. '

Position Fight
011 As Golf

Practice Starts

Pitt’s golf squad held their ﬁrst
practice of the season yesterday
afternoon at the Alcorna Country
Club as the ﬁght for positions on
the varsity began in earnest.

Loss of the veterans Bob Baugh-
man, Ed Walmsley, Frank Bonur-
atti and others from last year’s
city championship team leaves the
race for positions wide open. Sou-
chak, Daddio, Kay and Lawry re-
turn from last year’s aggregation
and will probably divide the ﬁrst
four positions, with Souchak the
outstanding candidate for No. 1
man.

Tony Kay, No. 2 man on last
year’s sextet, is the most consist-
ent of the returning men. Kay
ﬁnished Conference competition
last year with only one defeat,
that being by Fred Snee of George-
town.

Barrett Melvin, West Penn Jun-
ior Champion two years ago, is
the leading candidate from last
year’s freshman squad and has the
best chance of breaking into the
ﬁrst four slots. Lawry alternated
at No. 6 with Wamsley last year
and will move to ﬁfth if Melvin
makes good his threat.

That leaves one position to be
divided among the seven or eight
remaining candidates with the ad-
ditional chance of one of the big
ﬁve being, displaced.

The Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Association schedule recently re:
leased, , has Pitt. meeting Penn
State and Cornell in a three-team
match on May 6 and 7. This leaves
three weeks in which to pick men
for positions and to get them into
golﬁng form. '
