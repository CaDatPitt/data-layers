Thompson, Margolis 
Chair "Kicker ” CIC

by STEVE LUBETSKY

All that the Citizenship Information Center «CIC» needed was “a
good kick." Dr. Michael Margolis. CIC Board chairman and assistant
professor of Political Science. remarked. The blow was apparently
enough to get the CIC functioning.

Jane Thompson. a graduate of the University and the chairman of
the 7-1 Democratic Club. was appointed CIC director Thursday night.

And the CIC now has offices in 1209 CL «ext. 6471 or 6472) and
622 Social Science Building (ext. 6705».

One of the functions of the CIC, according to Dr. Margolis, is to
provide information concerning the election campaign to students.

Another function is to plan campus activities at which political can-
didates can discuss issues. The nature and frequency of such pro-
grams. Margolis explained. will depend on the discretion of the
director.

According to Margolis, “bu-
reaucratic inaction” was respon-
sible for the CICS delayed start.
“In any large organization, there
are problems of inefficiency be-
cause there are so many channels
to go through before a policy is ex-

ecuted,” he said. A. Allocations Committee

“It becomes necessary." the
professor continued. "to apply
pressure until it finally reaches
the boiling point at which some-
thing has to give. An editorial in
the Pitt News, he, believes. was
the decisive factor which led to
the CICS installation last week.

Margolis stressed that one of
the primary objectives of the CIC
is to facilitate student involve-
ment in politics. "The Center was
implemented to better acquaint
students with the political pro-
cess and will actively seek re-
cruits.”

The provocative academician.
who announced that he will will be
returning to Harvard University
in a few months. refused to be op-
timistic. "Those seeking to in-
duce the public to pay for univer-
sal higher education might useful-
ly remember that only 11 per cent
of the adult population of the Unit-
ed States graduated from a four-
year college. And despite the re-
cent growth in college attendance.
in 1985 that figure will have risen
only 14 or 15 per cent."

Describing “an adversary cul-
ture firmly entrenched in higher
education”—the source of his
gloom—Moynihan suggested that
America resembles Germany un-
der the Weimar Republic, “when
the same devaluation and destes-
tation of everything the policy
was able to achieve was also the
mark of the high intellectuals.”

The hardhitting Democrat ac-
cused the leaders of the nation‘s
universities of failing to cope with
the crisis. For all the spectacu-
lar minds that from time to time
have been put in charge of our
great institutions." he said. "on
balance the leadership has been
social and administrative . . . . .
rather than intellectual."

Emphasizing that “higher edu-
cation in America. for all its size.
remains a privilege." Moynihan
linked "an almost classic form of
nihilism (that! has been taking
root in uppper class culture“ to
the "elite" who attend institu-
tions of higher learning. '

He launched an all-out attack on

“intolerant” intellectuals and de-
fended Middle Americans with
considerable passion. “The silent
majority,” he contended, “is si-
lent not least because it finds it is
so difficult to say things in terms
that will win a respectful hearing
among those who judge such mat-
ters.” -

Applauding such vitrues as
"confidence in the nation. love of
the nation. a willingness to sacri-
fice for it"—-Moynihan quoted
Daniel Bell. who believes the ma-
jority no longer has an "intellec-
tually respectable culture of its
own."

Moynihan concluded that "in-
creasingly higher education will
come to stand for the humilitation
of traditional America. It would

then seem to follow that there will,» ~-:;

be some faltering in our apparent
progress toward universal higher
education.~I expect there will be."

Posvar Deﬁnes CIC

by TOM HEIPLE

Speaking to the University Senate last Thursday. Chancellor Wes-
ley W. Posvar announced that the Citizenship Information Center has

begun operating.

In his report, Dr. Posvar stated that the success of the program

would depend upon “how many students get out and participate." Pos-
var noted that if the recess is viewed as just a long weekend the pro-
gram would fail and the future of others would be jeopardized.

There will be programs scheduled on campus during the two day
recess for those students remaining at the University. The Chancellor
did stress. however, that those students taking part in the campaigning
must "participate in political action as individuals. It must be non-
partisan.“

In other matters, Dr. Posvar confirmed what many students may A

have already noticed, that the College of Arts and Sciences is approxi-

mately 1,000 students larger than had been anticipated. He noted that l

the increased enrollment is not just the result of freshman admis-

sions, but a combination of the low number of dropouts due to the lib- -

eralization of requirements and an increase in the number of transfer
students accepted.

In order to rectify the situation. the University is considering re-
ducing the size of next year‘s freshman class and also the number of
transfers accepted.

Commenting briefly on the budget tie-up in Harrisburg, Dr. Posvar
said. "It is clear that the state will have to have an expanded tax base
next spring . . . otherwise the state will grind to a halt . . . and it would
not be feasible to cut programs so late in the year.“

The Chancellor concluded his report with comments on the state of
affairs in higher education. He expressed concern over a “polarization
of attitudes and perceptions in our society. Some people outside the
University don't understand it, therefore they are frightened . . . which
results in the leveling of accusations and broadsides at the faculty.”

To solve this problem, he concluded that all those connected with
the University “must explain and portray the University as . . . a bul-
wark of our democracy.“ I

Prior to the adjournment of the Senate. Dr. Jack Matthews. presi-
dent, suggested that the Senate organize committees to investigate and
discuss future issues that could possibly develop into crisis matters
lie. the unionization of the faculty). He argued that committees act-
ing in this respect could make the Senate a more viable body.

Only about one—half of the peo-
ple who had considered taking
part in The Brig followed through
with tryouts when they heard of
the harsh rehearsal conditions.

Two ex-Marines and an ex-
Army man are putting the actors
through physical training and
daily drills. Kushner feels that
the punitive regimen is necessary
“to internalize the physical and
psychological aspects of military
life."

Another ex-Marine, who served
as a guard in Marine brigs in Ja-
pan and Vietnam, is serving as
technical advisor.

He also assists with drills and
is letting the troupe know how
closely the simulated barracks
parallels the crushing life of a
Marine prison.

Rehearsals are managed under
a set of regulations and a chain of
command is maintained. If. for in-

to the director, he must ask per-

Absolutely no excuses are ac-
cepted for late arrivals to rehear-
sals and during some breaks,
complete silence is ordered. Pun-
ishment details are assigned for
any infringement of the precepts.

Kushner is aware of the “ridi-
culous sense of frustration" that
members of the cast must experi-
ence when they attempt to con-
form to the military rules.

After each rehearsal there is a
“rap session" and everyone is en-
couraged to air any of his person-
al reactions to what took place
during the evening.

This not only gives the cast a
chance to work out any difficul-
ties, but, according to Kushner,
they are also “becoming aware of
just what it is that makes the pre-
sent military system strong.”

Since many of the actors may
not agree with military institu-
tions. ‘Kushner concludes that
they “must be capable of physical
and psychological endurance“ in
order to stage "a military world
that thrives on its being separate.
without sham."

The Brig will be staged Nov. 6

ter Memorial.

by POHLA SMITH
and JANE HENDERSON

Recently a reader wrote and
called attention to the many prob-
lems involved with living on Bay-

-ard Street and that the most pre-

valent problems are excessive
noice and parking difficulties.

One man voiced the neighbor-
hood's opinion of the usual week-
end din by saying. "It‘s impossi-
ble to sleep. You just don't count‘
on getting any sleep on Friday and
Saturday nights." The noise was
cited as being worst in the warm
weather. especially ‘after Pitt
games. when the parties spill
from inside the houses into the
streets. In past years the frats

1,‘.-have even placed live bands on
' the roofs of their houses.

Perhaps the most anoying
noise to the residents is the sound
of motorcycle owners drag rac-
-ing or just gunning their motors.
One neighbor commented, “Of
course, the police are never
around when this happens and the
motorcycles all disappear if they
do show up.”

Mrs. John J. Grunder express-
ed concern for the “elderly peo-

Bayard Place right behind the
houses. These people aren’t well
and this noise is something terri-

“Most of them are inconsider-
ate about parking in front of our
house." complained Mrs. Shirley
Arch. "They park right smack in

the drive and you can't get in or_
out. It's murder."

Another neighbor agreed whole-
heartedly, saying, “It’s really
bad if you have to catch a plane
and there is a car blocking the
drive.”

Garbage on the streets. in
yards. and between the houses is
another source of annoyance.
“Every morning I have to pick up
whiskey bottles and beer cans
from my front yard.“ related one
man.

"They are just messy.“ noted
one woman. who also said that the
garbage and general messiness
detract from the neighborhood.

Other, less frequent hazards
are the dangers of driving down
the street during a football or fris-
bee ﬁime, and having BB’s shot
at house windows by drunken
brothers.

Though generally displeased
with their Greek neighbors as a
group". all of the Bayr_d St. resi-
dents interviewed agreed that the
guys are courteous and congenial
individually. Mrs. Grunder noted
that the .fraternities are often
community minded. “The tore

new smooth one to prevent injury
by one of the elderly neighbors

Several of the respondents also
admitted having been invited to
attend the weekend bashes.

Associate Editor

“The middle class is dissolving into the working class and no-
body knows it yet,” remarked a labor organizer for 1l99P, the city
branch of the Hospital and Nursing Home Workers’ Union.

The woman’s theory was directly related to the functional pre-
mise of a capitalist society (and probably any other for that mat-
ter): the concept of supply and demand.

It has become apparent that employment and mobilization are
no longer so easily defined in terms of education.

While a college “oruniversity degree was at one time a guaran-
teed prerequiste for employment, graduating bachelors, masters
and even Ph.Ds. are discovering that they are in the same fix as
their working class, uneducated brothers and sisters.

A report in the Chronicle of Higher Education, June, 1970, re-
vealed that a significant number of doctoral recipients have been

- forced to take temporary post-doctural positions at their graduate

institutions.
The number of essentially jobless scholars has risen from 11
per cent in 1969 to 17.7 per cent this year.

The situation has reached crisis proportions. Part of the prob-
lem concerns the vast numbers of students and the limited number
of jobs. Another correlated aspect is the relative youth of our society
and the steadily growing enrollment figures in the colleges.

The consequence is that formerly “secure” employments are
facing the same survival dilemmas experienced for centuries by the
so-called working class.

Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation recently laid off more
than 4,000 of its workers; engineering corporations in California are
laying off college-educated personnel by the thousands.

The tightening job» market and the practical realization that
jobless people are helpless without protection are prompting the
rash of “professional” unions that have made headlines over the
past year. The organization of the teachers is the most famous.

The supply in this country has exceeded the demand and the
costs in a capitalist state always fall on those without power. Al-
though the “privilege” of a college education has always divided the
wealthy from the non-wealthy. its increasing availability is closing
the gap.

Jobless people, regardless of the number of titles following
their names are all in the same boat.

..  Although the standard of living in the United States has risen _
‘ ‘ markedly (even poor people now have televisions), the number of

employment opportunities has not risen with it. Our society is rath-

er becoming more automated.

Nevertheless, despite the expansion of the "jobless" class. the
major corporations continue to operate. »

Motivated by profit accumulation vs. the social welfare ,“A,3§their
workers, the conglomerates have the unbridled option to 
employment rolls and decrease production while maintainingvtheir
gains. ‘ .

The employment crisis hits especially hard on the most oppres-
sed groups—women and blacks. Women have always functioned as
“fill-in" labor and they are the first to be cut from the rolls when the
market tightens.

This built-in stigma is tied to another thought that the woman
organizer voiced: the plight of the American woman has its roots
with working women and that plight is most basically linked to the

Against The Tide

 

Much   Ado About Nothing

by FRANK DONATELLI
Staff Columnist

Back last May when the creation of the Presi-
dential Commission on Campus Unrest was an-
nounced, political pundits expressed surprise at
the Commission’s make—up. V

Loaded with liberals and even some radicals,
many felt that the final report would be extremely
critical of the Administration and would read some-
thing like the 1972 Democratic platform. One
columnist went so far as to call the Commission

“the greatest fifth column in political history.”

Indeed, the report did come dangerously close.‘

to being a “white-wash of campus violence." How-
ever, due primarily to the efforts of panel member
Lt. General Benjamin Davis, the final draft of the
report was moderated considerably.

STILL, the report was, in the
words of Dr. S. I. Hayakawa, “a
remarkably empty, pussyfoot—
ing document." The blame for
campus turmoil is spread so
thin that it is impossible to pin
anything on anybody.

The first part of the report
deals with the present situation
on campus and possible explana-

_tions for it. The major theme here is that the

emergence of a “new culture" among some of the
young has led to “intolerance" by many Ameri-
cans. and as ‘a result the country now suffers from
“polarization." .

-- How does the "new culture" view the world?
"They see the Indochina War as an onslaught by a

technological giant upon the peasant people of a

small, harmless and backward nation. . . They ar-
gue that we are the first nation with sufficient re-
sources to create not only decent lives for some,“
but a decent society forlall. . . .' They feel they
mustremaké Amlericatin its own image.“

AS FAR AS it goes. the explanation sounds
plausible. Where the Commission goes wrong,
however. is when it attributes the rise of this
“new culture“ to the’“idealism of youth."

While idealism is certainly desirable and un-
questionably plays an important part in the “new
culture" for some. I would suggest that beliefs as
foolish as these entail much more than mere ideal-

~1sm.

Professor John Greenway recently stated,
“The underlying cause of student rebellion is sim-
ply the biologically imperative fact that human be-
ings. like all successful species are as bad as they
are allowed to be ‘

 

 
 

 
   

TOO OFTEN, STUDENTS of today have b en
lavishly praised without earning that praise. Ite: is
difficult indeed to tell someone who has been told a
thousand times that his generation is the brigh\:-
est. most concerned in history that it really isn t
and that perhaps he needs to learn a little more
before he seeks to “remake America in his own
image."

The remedies the Commission offers are. on

I the whole, empty. ‘-

They ask the President to “exert moral leader-
ship." But surely we can’t expect the President of
the United States to be the “campus cop.” How are
we to know what this moral leadership should con-
sist of‘? And no mention is made of the things Mr.
Nixon has already done to relieve campus un-
rest such as reducing American involvement in,
Vietnam, moving toward a voluntary military,
sending Administration officials out to the cam-
puses, and arranging special permits for protest
demonstrations in the nation’s capitol.

THE COMMISSION ALSO asks certain offi-
cials to “cool their rhetoric," an obvious refer-
ence to Vice-President Agnew. While this is a pop- »
ular refrain, it doesn’t stand up very well under
analysis. Campus turmoil existed long before Mr.

Agnew ever became veep. Countries such as‘

France, England and Japan experience student
trouble, yet the Vice-President’s influence there
is minimal.

The Commission calls for “increased aid for
higher education . .  This argument presupposes
a positive relationship between money spent on
education and campus tranquility. In reality trou-
ble occurs most frequently at places which have
the largest budgets.

These assembly-line educational factories

have three things in common—bureaucracy, big- ‘ *

ness, and purposelessness. Many within the body
politic of these multiversities either don’t belong
there or have no interest_at all in pursuing their

‘ college careers. In fact, one could make a strong

argument that more money to these places would
only increase the frustration and turmoil.

THE REPORT DOES have some good points.
Its rather strong condemnation of campus mili-‘
tants is to be commended. So also is the Com-
mittees condemnation of certain law enforcement
officers who overreact in certain situations as was

probably the case in the Jackson State tragedy?’

The plea for “tolerance“ and “understanding” is
also admirable.

Generally, however, the report offered no new
insights into the campus-problem. In trying to
please everybody, it wound up satisfying no one
and saying very little

A rumor recently confirmed
- by the‘ Department of Speech and
Theatre Arts has revealed the
administration (under the aus-
pices of Vice Chancellor of Fi-
nance Edison Montgomery) has

_, allotted the space in the Cathe-

dral basement now occupied by
the Theatre Shop to Central
Printing.

Pitts ’ ,4 ctorsi £1/pmdzzélc?

Because of the shops size and
accessibility to both Stephen

_. Foster Memorial and to the Stu-

dio Theatre. the shop is quite vi-
tal to the growth of the Univer-
sity program here at Pitt. With-
out the proper set and lighting
design. a play really has no life
to it. This. in turn, cuts down on
the quality of the productions
that the University Theatre
chooses to do. which results in a
lower standard of theatre edu-
cation.as well as entertainment.

The study of theatre is a much

more demanding field than most ~

people think. Today theatre is
more than just an extra-curricu-
lar activity: it is training and
education for a future means of
living. justas math or chemis-
try is to the aspiring scientist.
AN ACTOR must constantly

v be aware of the world around

him. as well as being adapt in
voice and body movement. The
study of human nature is a very
complex one. which the actor
must continue to learn and to ex-
plore. even beyond his four
years atcollege. V '

_Actin is people. and it is quite

.  : .  tlln m.t.-i:t..--

of mathematical formulas is
more important than the study
of human beings and how they
exist. according to most think-
ers. Whenever departmental
budgets need to be trimmed. it
seems that the departments of
the Arts are the firstto be cut.

Transferring to Carnegie-Mel-
lon University is not the answer.
Even though C-MU is an excel-
lent school for theatre. trans-
ferring there hastwo prime dis-
advantages: (I) it is much more
expensive to attend C-MU. and
(2) whereas Pitt requires cours-
es in other disciplines (Natural
and Social Sciences) for a much
broader liberal arts education.
the C-MU drama curriculum
places stronger emphasis on a
more professional program of
training.

BECASUE Vice Chancellor
Montgomery wants Central
Printing in the Cathedral to
make some easier dollars. the
Theatre department has to suf-
fer. The cultural duc:-tion of
theatre enthusiasts has to suf-
fer. My own theatre education

as to suffer. Why‘?

unw amen" ‘he creative.l‘artfs.,;i.§

 

allowed to perpetuate at Pitt?
Why must the Fine Arts, the Stu-
dio Arts. and the Theatre De-
partments always receive low
priority when it comes to funds‘?
Why does Pitt consider the num-
ber of engineers it graduates
each year more valuable than
the exhibition of creative, hu-
man talents’? More important.
why does a service organization
(Central Printing) get priority
over a teaching area? If anyone
knows the answer. please let me
know, care of 1101 Tower C.

Then maybe I'lll understand them

philosophy of this “liberal arts"
university.

Then. too, I might understand
why the Vice Chancellor, with-
out consulting or notifying any
of the Theatre faculty before-
hand, is taking the shop away
from us, and giving it to Central

Printing. After all, Einstein's ‘

Theory might be more clearly
understood if it were printed on
orange posters with yellow
"Day-Glo" lettering.

YAF Defends Self
Cohen Article Hit

Editor. The Pitt News:

In response to Mark Cohen‘s
scurrilous .misrepresentation of
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF) I feel must make a few
comments. First, the fundamen-
tal principles of YAF stress the
inherent value of the individual
and his basic right to be free from
restrictions of arbitrary force.
Mr. Cohen could not subscribe to
these principles and dares not at-
tack them straightforwardly. so
he must resort to smear tactics
and other equally cowardly meth-
ods of subterfuge.

If Mr. Cohen were really honest
he would say that he does not be-
lieve in free speech for non-Marx-
ists. He would also admit that he
does not believe in the individuals
right to dissent his orthodoxy.

Further, he would proclaim that
he believes that the individual
should be subordinated to his levi-
athan Marxist state, which, he
will soon “wither away" if his
mad revolution succeeds.

Yes, Mr. Cohen is being dishon-
est and cowardly. He berates
YAF for calling for an end to cam-
pus violence, superficially, be-
cause he says he believes it is hy-
pocritical. However, he does not
state his belief that there should
be violence on campus.

He lies outright when he says
that “peace on campus in YAF
terms is . . . opposition to all pro-
test." YAF would be among the
first to affirm the individual’s
right to dissent against any gov-
ernment policy. We do it our-
selves.

***i5i?'Letters To The Editor -it

Response: Z’/1e /6’zzne 0/ ,4,ent/1g/

Yes. Mark Cohen is indeed the
very same sort of hypocrite and
fascist that he accuses YAF of
being. He calls us “good Ger-
mans“ when in reality he is wear-
ing the brown shirt.

0/ Student Opinion

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wish to comment on the posi-
tive position taken by Mr. Werner
of the fraternity system here at
Pitt. Here is one man's opinion.

If Mr. Werner would look at the
fraternity system from afar, he
would see that all is not exactly as
he makes it out to be. He says that
the fraternity has an outstanding
product to sell, but it seems that
each year fewer people sign up
and are sold by the pitch.

In terms of what I have seen for
the past three years, the fraterni-
ties do more to turn guys off than
to turn them on.

It used to be that you had to be
someone special to join a frater-
nity, but what about now? Frater-
nity initials on an application for
admission to graduate school’
used to work in one’s favor. Now I
suspect the Greek letters would
be detrimental to the desired goal.

Fraternity spirit has gone
downhill, too. This can be seen
merely by going to a football
game. When the time comes for
everyone to form the tunnel, which
usually dorm girls and Greeks do,
not too many brothers partici-
pate. The shout heard ’round the
stadium at a game is the call to
the pledges, for the brothers don‘t
want to be bothered.

Frat Story Called  
ldealistic Picture

Editor, The Pitt News:

The sheer intuitiveness of the
Student Government as to the will
of the student body positively
amazes me.

At least four major eastern col-
leges—Notre Dame, Brown, Car-
negie-Mellon and Dartmouth -
have opted against the political
holidays that the SG and a number
of faculty have decided for Pitt
students.

Two of the schools, Notre
Dame and Brown, decided the is-
sue by student referendum. The
vote of Notre Dame students was
three to one against the time off
. . . the summer term.

All this leads me to believe that
a referendum here, during the fall
term, in the presence of the entire
student body, would have been a
reasonable thing to do.

Seen in retrospect, the June de-
cision of SG was made in the pas-

sionate aftermath of the Kent

Participatory democracy seems
to be a noble thing when taken into

Abortion Arrests

Three prominent local physi-
cians, Drs. Felix Miller, Louis
Meyers iand Wilfred Finegold,
were cited by D. A. Robert Dugan
for “conspiracy to commit abor-
tion” in an action early last week.
Reports indicated that the offi-
cial is planning to subpoena area
hospital records, including Magee
Women’s, which handles a large
number of therapeutic abortions
In re-
sponse, a city-university wom-
en’s group, the Pittsburgh Radical
Women's Union, picketed Dugan’s
office demanding abortion on re-
quest, dissemination of abortion
and birth control information and
“release” of the three doctors. A
preliminary hearing is scheduled
for tomorrow night for the three
men.

‘  f;H>eading for Baltimore's Friendship International Airport
and fa fl-ight back to Pittsburgh after an unimpressive 10-8 vic-
toryﬁover Navy Saturday. some Pitt football players were talk-
" ing about the prospects of beating powerhouse Notre Dame.

  ‘Beat Notre Dame‘? If the Panthers continue to play the
game,-the way they did against weak Navy——the way they played
4;ﬁthe.,,last three weeks——the gridders probably couldn‘t beat any-
oneremaining on their schedule. inculding racially-disturbed
-Syra-cuse and Miami. a team whose head coach quit recently.

 'Sornehow it’s hard to enjoy the Panthers‘ three consecutive
wins, The triumphs have come against the weakest teams on the
.sc’h_edul_e—Baylor. Kent State and Navy. Most observers ex-
p"e‘et.e‘dCarl DePasqua's squad to win the three games. but there
_was,js.omething evident that wasn't predicted. “Ragged" is the
word" DePasqua chooses to use when describing the Panther
Play. ' .1

 

_, ; (j The group of players discussing the pipe dream about the
"‘1'Sout,_li, Bend, Ind., lrishmen admitted to the poor performances
in victory, but things like dropping ten points behind the South-

iyyigst.-;Conference’s worst team (Baylor), letting a small univer-

sity team (Kent State) hold its own for three quarters, and bare-

l-ylﬁfsqitijeaking past a 14-point underdog (Navy) didn’t shatter
their hopes. None of the Panthers appeared to be excited about
‘ jtlipir {three-game winning streak, but disappointment wasn't

Z~eyiilent’ either. ‘

’ ..;“,‘Sure. we played three bad games. and we won't be favored‘
.by-_*1_4'again.“ injured linebacker Joe Carroll said, but he gave

EthTe‘i‘mpression that the team would play better. that they would

; ‘_ ‘put“ijt9all together."

 Panthers may not be favored at all this year if they
.kdon‘t"lose« the raggedness. They surely won’t_ be favored this

_yveek._when--they meet one of the nation's best teams, West Vir-
'ginia.;(in*a Homecoming affair.

5": . -"West Virginia lost their first game last Saturday to a Duke
’;te.ai_nfthat is improved over the Blue Devil squad the Panthers
edged last year. But that loss can only ease the burden slightly
. __for‘the Pitt gridders Saturday, if not make things harder. You
_.kii"ow,‘,a team that was pointing for 11-0 can be rough after that
 $7 fir'st}de’feat.

 ".',_§P'itt‘s chances against the Mountaineers are lessened by the
.‘difficulty in discovering why the team didn‘t run away from
,thosel’last.three opponents. Injuries and an offense that just
";doesn"t show any particular partiality to the end zone are good
-guesses. but substitues have produced favorably. and the of-
fense shows signs of possible productivity most of the time. .

{Defensive end Dick Oldshue. who has replaced two different
‘ijrijured-ends. offered an explanation.

 

:,.._“It”s hard adjusting with the injuries,” he said. “But we
“§hou‘ld=have won by more anyway. I don’t know, maybe we’re a
- -team that plays just enough to win, and we can go out and beat
.W,,e_st‘-Virginia. I seem to think we play just well enough to win.”

 
   
  
   
  
    
 
  
 

' The Panthers will have to play their best game of the season
-to_play just well enough to beat West Virginia Saturday. They‘11
_-7_l'iave',to look as sharp as they did in the first half against UCLA a
l‘ong‘.t_hr_ee-weeks ago.

 Notre Dame? It’s not bad to dream about the Irishmen.
Ara Parseghians men are far enough away to hope the Panthers
 improve to the "well enough to beat" stage with the Mid-

iSpic1:o’sFG Auemp

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor
5 Joe Spicko walked onto the field at Navy-Marine Corps Stadium in
§ Annapolis Saturday with 30 seconds gone in the fourth quarter and the
f sense of being there before must have been frightening.

The Panther kicking specialist split the uprights with a 22-yard
field goal to give the Pitt gridders a 10-8 lead which they protected for
their third consecutive win. but the boot wasn‘t as easy as it sounds.

The last time Pitt played at the Navy stadium. two years ago. i

Spicko attempted a three-pointer
from approximately the same.
close range on a third down. He
missed that one. and the Panthers
lost the game, 17-16. And Pitt
fans forgot about the 41-yarder
he had placed perfectly earlier in
the game.

The 41-yarder was the only
field goal Spicko had converted as
a three-year Panther prior to Sat-
urday’s game. But even Spicko
was thinking of the missed field
goal, which happened to be at the
same end of the stadium as Satur-
day’s important kick.

“Yeah, I sure was." Spicko said
afterwards. "I think I would have
shot myself if I'd missed this one."

The Spicko field goal was ne-
cessitated by a Navy touchdown
and a two-point conversion play
‘in the third quarter.

Navy scored on a 16-yard
scamper by quarterback Mike
McNallen and took an 8-7 lead
when McNallen passed to Andy
Pease for two points.

Pitt. however. continued to
have problems finding a healthy
quarterback. -

Panther coach Carl DePasqua
started Tom Hasbach. his third
different starter in three weeks.
deciding‘ to give strong-armed
John Hogan a longer rest on his
two-week-old ankle injury. Sec-
one-string quarterback Dave Hav-
ern. suffering with a back bruise.

listened to the game on the radio
in Pittsburgh. '

Hasbach led the Panthers
through their first offensive
series and gained little. The sec-
ond time the squad obtained the
ball, Hogan was the field general.

The Panthers scored once un-
der Hogan's direction in the first
half. In the only scoring drive by
either team in the opening half.
the Panthers marched from their
own 42-yard-line. Hogan com-
pled four passes. and fullback Phil
Sgrignoli took two strong plunges
through the Navy defensive line.
setting up Denny Ferris‘ two-yard
trip into the end zone.

But Hogan couldn‘t avoid the in-
jury stigma which bothers the
Pitt quarterbacks:

On the final play of the third
period, with the Panthers threat-
ening the goal line, Sgrignoli was
hit at the line of scrimmage and
flipped the ball back to his quar-
terback. The unsuspecting Hogan
was smeared by Navy tackles and
suffered a knee injury which, once
again, places him on the list of
questionable starters.

Hasbach returned as the fourth
quarter began, as the strange,sea-
son of opportunity continued for
the number three quarterback.
DePasqua's removing Hasbach
after only one series contributed
to the unusual year for Hasbach.
who must always make himself
available for action.

"I didn‘t understand his (De-
Pasqua’s) reasoning. "Hasbach
said. referring to his quick exit.
"But I went out knowing John Ho-
gan would play most of the time.
and I’d go in if he got hurt.“

-‘ it

  

Jo SPICKO

And, of course, Hogan got hurt.
Now, having someone like split
end Steve Moyer around for pre-
cautionary measures at quarter-
back no longer sounds like a joke.

DePasqua was also glad to have
Ralph Cindrich around Saturday.
The Panthers‘ pre-season All-
American linebacker returned to
action for the first time since his
opening game injury, replacing
George Feher, who was slightly
jarred late in the second quarter.

Friday night, Cindrich was talk-
ing about a week—and—a-half ago
when he never expected to play
football again and how he would
prefer staring against Navy.
avoiding the anticipation along the
sidelines.

“When I first went out today I
wanted to start,” Cindrich .said
after the game. “And I thought
about it . . . but I'm glad I didn’t
start now. I wouldn't have been
loosened up.”

Cindrich revealed that there
was a little, pain on the first few
plays. but that he felt good the
rest of the way. His first walk
onto the field had to feel better
than‘ the one Spicko made in the
fourth quarter.

Cross Country Team

Places Fifth At N.D.

by MARTY HELLMAN

The cross country team found
the opposition rough in the Notre
Dame Invitational on Friday af-
ternoon. but managed to take fifth
place with a team total of 165

points.

A powerful Bowling Green
squad outdistanced all 30 teams in
the field and won the Invitational
with a score of 51 points.

Jerry Richey was the top fin-
isher for the harriers. as he plac-
ed sixth with a time of 24:19 over
the five mile course.

Jim Harris of Western Michi-
gan won the race with a time of
23:50. He paced his team to a
second place team standing, as
they had 117 points.

The other two teams to come in
ahead of the harriers were East-
ern Michigan with 141 points and
Illinois with 164.

Assistant Coach Don Mollen-
auer was a bit disappointed over
the outcome. but he mentioned

that the squad entered with a \

slight disadvantage.
“We have had a lot-less compe-

_ titionm than "injany, of‘; the:.teams_, in

the lféce,",’ he"sai’(l.. “The vyinnefs’

The lack of early meets and
Coach Jim Banner‘s training
methods this year. hurt the run-
ners at Notre Dame.

“The emphasis so far in our
training." continued Mollenauer,
"has been distance work. and not
speed work. Because the course
at Notre Dame was a completely
flat one. the first part of the race
was extremely fast and some of
the guys weren't quite ready for
it."

The early fast pace took its toll
on Dave Szabat. At the end of the
first mile, Dave was the top run-
ner for the barriers, but he could
not keep up throughout and fell
way behind in the latter stages.

Scoring for the squad besides
Richey were Mike Schurko, who
placed 13th: Mark Vornhagen.
51st, and Greg Rodgers, 57th.

Mollenauer expects that the
squad will improve as the season
goes on.

“We will get better as we get
more dual meet experience in the
next couple of weeks.

Booters Tame Temple;

Ratings Should Ris

by STEVE zvcn

“It was a team effort. The fellows played as a unit and did it
well." Leo Bemis said after his Pitt booters knocked off highly tout-
ed Temple University 3-0 Saturday in Philadelphia.

The first goal of the game was scored by Tunisian Ali Rdissi
who now has scored four goals. the team high in that department.

Insurance goals were added by
Tony Nicholakopoulos and Len
Raffa. These scores were Tonys
second goal of the season and
Raffas first.

The victory, though, was mar-
red by another injury to John
White who was the team's lead-
ing scorer last season. Thus Bem-
is faces Grove City tomorrow with
three of his top players unable
to play due to injuries: fullbacks
John White and Gary Midock and
forward Tsima Lekoma of Bot-
swana who was the team’s lead-
ing scorer two years ago.

Midock’s place was taken by
freshman Fernando Carriquiry
while Lekoma’s slot was filled
by Dennis Kohlmyer, also a
freshman.

Midock is expected to be rea-
dy for Fridays encounter with
Ohio which nipped Pitt last
year, 2-1. in overtime.

"If the boys can continue to
play as a team. then we just
might go undefeated from here
on out." said Bemis.

The team’s record now stands
at 3-2 with seven games remain-
ing in the season, including two
matches this week. Tomorrow the
team travels to Grove City for a
3:00 p.m. game and on Friday
will host Ohio University at 2:00

J V Booters
Tie Indiana
University

Despite 32 shots on goal and
numerous scoring opportunities.
the best the Pitt JV soccer team
could manage against Indiana
University of Pennsylvania was a
1-1 deadlock.

Pitts only goal of the game
came at 6:16 of the second period
when Abdul Almusallam. the for-
ward from Kuwait. intercepted a
goal kick off the foot of Indiana
goalie Jim Griffith and raced in
all alone for the score. It was his
first of the season.

p.m. on the Astro Turf at Pitt
Stadium.

Tomorrows opponent. Grove
City, was defeated by the Pitt
squad 3-0 last. year. but Bemis is
apprehensive. "Last year they
played on our field and were
basically an inexperienced squad.
This year they return with prac-
tically the same team. more ex-
perienced, though. and with re-
venge in their hearts. Besides
we’ll be playing on their field.
which is considerably smaller
than ours and this is a definite
advantage for them as we like to
pass a lot. and a smaller field
restricts our game.“

However Bemis feels his team

will be “up" for tomorrow‘;
game with Grove City.

fleet winger from Bogota. Col-

Table Softball Repeat
Prevented by 4-2

  Loss To Shellebies

by STEVE WILLIAMS
Table. last year's intramural softball champion was eliminated by

the Shellebies. 4-2. Thursday.

Joe Colella. who over a two year period accumulated ten wins and
only one loss. gave up only seven hits but two errors. one his own. were

. his downfall.

An error in the first inning led
to three unearned runs. which was
enough for the Shelleby victory.

Collman’s

Six Goals
Spark Win

Lynne Collman provided the ex-
citement in the Pitt Women's
Field Hockey victory over Wheel-
ing College in the West Virginia
city Saturday.

Lynne scored all of the squads
goals in their 6-1 win.

The six goals are a personal
high for the Pitt center forward.
who is the leading scorer on the
team. In fact. six goals is high for
a team‘ total.

Lynne received plenty of assis-
tance from the “inners” during
the game, with Jackie Adams,
right inner, looking the most im-
pressive, according to coach De
Burnstine.

The victory boosted the Field
Hockey teams record -to 2-1-1.
as their short season draws to a
close this week. The season ends
Wednesday with a match at Trees
Field. but first the squad must
travel to Bethany for a match to-
day.

Bob Parks flied out to start the
inning. Denny Dedo walked fol-
lowed by Walt Kochirka’s single,
put men on first and second and
one out. Jack Marianna flied out
for the second out of the inning,
both runners holding base.

Jim Conlin then lined a three
hop ground ball right at Table
third baseman Steve Volk. who
misjudged the ball for a three
base error instead of an inning
ending forceout. Both Dedo and
Kochirka scored unearned runs.

Tony Balawjder singled home
Conlin for the third and final un-
earned run of the inning.

The Shellebies stretched their
lead to four runs on another un-
earned run in the fifth inning.

Al Hogel. the winning pitcher.

Bob Parks grounded to Colella.
who made an errant throw at sec-
ond. attempting the force which
resulted in two on and only one
out instead of one on and two out.

Denny Dedo grounded to short
and outran the attempted double
play throw to first with Al Hogel
scoring from third.

Table threatened in the third
with Bill Paolisak and Colella on
and only one out. but Steve Volk
lined into an easy double play to
end the inning.

In the fourth Bob Flygar and

Bob Madar reached base. but the .

third double play the Shellebies
executed erased the threat.

Table scored both of their runs
in the seventh inning. Singles
from John Stanich. Bob Madar
and Buck Chobirko yeilded one
run. Carl Manns singled home Bob
Madar and it looked as if Table
might possibly rally and win the
game. But Bill Pavlisak ground-

Netwomen Sprint To

Win Over Chatham

by JAN FRY

Pitt's women‘s tennis team just
might go in for jogging when its
season terminates.

Chatham had the team running
all over the court during last
Thursdays match.

Pitt. however. crushed its op-
ponent.5-0.

“I’ve been jogging in my spare
time and it really paid off,” com-
mented Eileen Surdoval, Pitt’s
number one singles player. “I
think" the ball covered every part
of the court.”

Eileen defeated Sue Mohlman.
a veteran tournament player from
Connecticut. 6-0. 3-6. 6-3. Both
girls played a strategic base line
match.

Volleyball To

{Continued from Page 7)

other senior stars are returning
to try to improve last years 5-1
record.

The Pitt volleybaall team will
meet some new schools this year.
The coach felt that “playing the
smaller schools caused some
problems last fall. When we came
up against a tough team. our girls
took their time settling down to
play.“

It was the second time Elaine
Kingas had played tennis with
Judy Rea. a three year veteran of
the Chatham team. Judy had been
Elaine's doubles partner last
summer in the Edgeworth Club
tournament. This time they were
opponents in the second singles
match.

Elaine, who usually plays an
aggressive net game, played base
line most of the match. Judy pick-
ed up a lot of shallow balls with
cross-court forehand shots that
kept Elaine running.

She was good competition." re-
marked Elaine. "She almost beat
me." The final score was to
Elaines advantage. 4-2. 4-6. 6-0.

"She played a much harder
game than last time." comment-
ed Joann Kotjan concerning Della
Snyder. her opponent from Chat-
ham. Joann played net more than
usual but balls kept slamming into
the net. more than usual. Her
placement of shots. use of the lob.
and hard serve. however. were to
her advantage and she was victor.
6-4. 6-3.

Sue Baer and Mary Swallow de-
feated Chatham’s number one
doubles team, 7-5 and 6-3 with
much difficulty.

"We hit the ball too lightly. and
when we hit it hard it went out."
remarked Mary. "There were too
many mistakes on our part. I‘m
glad we won.“

Chatham lived up to their repu-
tation of strategic playing. Sue
commented. “It's the first time
