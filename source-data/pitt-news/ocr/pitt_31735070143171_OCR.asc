County Executive Dan Onorato announces his bid for governor — but not without protests

Richard Rosengarten
Staﬂ” Writer

Even before his ﬁrst day in oﬁice, Dan
Onorato wants to change history.

Gov. Ed Rendell is almost through
with his two terms. He cannot run for
a third, and by Pennsy1vania’s trend of
alternating its choice of govemor’s po-
litical party every eight years, it’s may
be a Republican’s turn in 2010. But
Onorato hopes to overcome the state’s
60-year habit.

Onorato, currently the Allegheny
County Executive, ofﬁcially announced
his candidacy for governor yesterday,
joining ahandful of other Pennsylva-

nians vying for Renc_lell’s job. Among’

them are state Auditor General Jack
Wagner and Tom Knox, a Philadel-
phia business man who spent millions
in a failed 2007 bid for Philadelphia

mayor.

Onorato traveled the state during
the day, announcinghis candidacyﬁrst

a resolution

Estelle Tran
‘ Assistant News Editor

, tudent Government Board
memberscharlie Shull and
Lance Bonner introduced a

resolution outlining the Board’s plan _
to address G—2o—related concerns at
the meetinglastnight. *

‘ The motion said the Board would
“workwith the University adminis-
tration to inform the students of the
reasoning for speciﬁc police action in
the Oakland community during the
G-20 Summit and to dispel associ-
ated misinformation.”

Board member Nila Devanath
didn’t believe the resolution had
enough “teeth.” .

. _ “Put some ideas into the resolu-
tionso students reading the resolu-

‘ tion would know what Working on’

means,” she said. A
The resolution also said that the

Board would help the University
identity students who violated the
Student Code of Conduct during the
G-20 and support those who were ar-
rested and charged with crimes they

didn’t commit. The Board will vote on

the resolution next week. -

SGB president Kevin_Morrison
introduced a motion to amend the
Board’s bylaws, which he said can
change according to the sitting ,
boards preferences. He said the .

Devanath raised a point during
the meeting about how the new

appoint students to various positions.

“There could be cronyism. There
could be some kind ofbias,” she said,
adding that it might not be a problem
now, but it could be in the ﬁiture. '

Ravenstahl’ s Pittsburgh ostracizes college crowd

Giles Howard
Columnist

 

Eschewingthe typical ideological iden-
tity and principled policy positions that
identify a politician as either a Demo—
crat or a Republican, Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl is running for re—election as
both a Republican and Democrat.

Ravenstahl, a life-long Democrat,
ﬁnagled this by defeating a challenger
inthe Democratic primary andwinning
the write-in contestforthe Republican
nominationwith 607votesfrom Pitts-
burgh Republicans.

With the two—party system success-
fullybroken to Ravenstahls will, two In-

dependent challengers, Franco “Dok” I

Harris and Kevin Acklin, emerged to
contest the election.

Acklin, a business lawyer who grew
upinsouth Oaklandandholds degrees
ﬁom both Harvard and Georgetown,
said he launched his campaign “to
wrest control of this city from the Ma-

chine.” Acklin said that this election is

' about bringing stronger leadership to

the mayor’s oﬁice and eliminating the
corruption that has ﬂourished during
the Ravenstahl administration. —
Acklin’s got a point. Ravenstahl’s
tenure in office has been dogged by
unexplained no-bid contracts, the
awardingof city contractstocampaign

_ contributors when they’re the highest

bidder, and Ravenstahl’s personal mis-
use of city resources such as the SUV
purchased with Homeland Security
dollars that he took to a Toby Keith
concert.

It’s hard to disagree with Acklin.

when he says, “[The Ravenstahl] ad-
ministrationisbeing runforthe beneﬁt
of afew.” RememberthatPitt students
are Ravenstahl’s new cash cow
Ravenstahl recentlyproposedlevy-
inga $100 fee against college students
in order to help resolve the city’s pen-
sion crisis. Both Independent candi-
dates came out strongly against this
fee with Harris characterizing it as a

cynical attempttoextractmoneyﬁoma
constituency without the political clout
to contest it.

Harris said the extra fee when stu-
dents are prevented by their studies
from holding down full-time jobs. The
city should instead look to wealthier
non-proﬁts like UPMC and others that
own large amounts oﬂand throughout

the city but pay no taxes, Harris said. ’

LikeAcklin, Harris saidthathe’s run-
ningto bringleadershiptothe mayor’s
ofﬁceﬂarriswillappearontheballotas
a candidate of the “Franco Dok Harris

_ Party,” and he said that Ravenstahl’s

decision to run as both a Democrat
and Republican reﬂects poorly on his
personal character and demonstrates
that he’ll do anything to win.

Butthe same can’tbe said ofI-Iarris,
whose campaignhas imposed caps on
contributions of $2,400 per individual
and $4,800 perhousehold. Harris said
that these caps are necessary because

its irnpossibletoshowvoters thatyou’ll ,
I bring change tothe city if you don’t

change the way campaigns are rtm in
the ﬁrst place.

NeitherRavenstahl norAcklin have _

joined Harris inthis self—irnposed cam-
paign ﬁnance reform, and Acklin said
thatit simply isn’tfeasible. Acklin said,
“We’re running to win,” and Harris’s
contribution capswouldmake itimpos—

, sibletodefeatRavenstahl’swell-fundedA

campaign. ,
AlthoughAcklinandHarrisdisagree'

onthis questionofcampaigncontribu-

tions, both candidates saidthatthebest

1 way to keep youngpeople in the city is

to promote small businesses and help
start-ups establish themselves in local
neighborhoods in_ orderto create jobs
for college graduates.

Harris said that the role‘ of the ‘

mayor should be to forge public-pri-

b vateparmerships investzinginstareups

and encouraging entrepreneurship. If
elected, Harris said he would work to
rebuild business districts and help con-

nect entrepreneurs withfreelegal and b

business help irom local schools.

Acklinisequallyfocused oncreating
jobs for yotmg people and he stressed
the importance of competition and en-
trepreneurship in rebuilding the city’s
economy. Acklin said that, if elected,

he’dmakethen_1ayor’soﬂicea“onestop We
shop” for entrepreneurs where they ‘

couldbeconnectedwithlocalresources

that would help them build a business °

and create j obs.

One thingis clear: There is no room
for young people in Ravenstahl’s ver-
sion ofPittsburgh, where business deals
aretiedtocampaign contributions and

. students are treated as an easy source

of revenue in times of crisis.

Salvia’s medical potential warrants

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed -

For The Pitt News

I was on You'I‘ube the other day and
came across a grippingvideo of adazed
guy stumbling about, laughing. I was
immediately interested. V
The culprit responsible for his
stupor, Salvia divinorum, is not a new
discovery for man. The planthas been
used in the Mazatec culture in Mexico
by shamans since at least 1939. The

derivative’s effects can induce divina-.

tion and vision formation. Perfect for
inner thought.

Apparently this strong hallucino-
gen has youth and digniﬁed scientists
knocking on its front door. Salvia de-
serves such attention, especially ﬁ'om
the research realm.

The consumers in the video were
a college-age group. That is partly un-
derstandablez a2008 study, conducted
by Dr. Khey atthe University ofFloricla,
shows that22.6 percent of the students
surveyed knew of Salvia, and most of
them had heard of itfrom theirﬁ-iends,
among other sources.

He admits that these numbers may
not be deﬁnitive. One possible error is

survey methodology. Another couldbe
that these students were in the South-
ern U.S.,where Salvia, originatingﬁom
Mexico, might be more available.

The key component in the plant,
Salvinorin A, works similar to opiate
drugs like morphine. However, since

, it is speciﬁc in what it binds to, avoid-

ing certain brain receptors that opiate
drugsbind to, it does not leadtosimilar
addiction or euphoria.

Psychiatric researchers at Harvard
Medical School noted that Salvinorin
A can have antidepressant effects and
mood stabilizing relief for those with
bipolar disorders. Other scientists con-

tenditcouldhaveusesintreatmentfor ,

schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s and even

AIDS.Just likeyou, Iwas asking myself, '

“Whaaa???” "I‘is true.

The same teamatHarvardbelieves
that the molecule can be altered to in-
crease its medicinal elﬁcacy. Such desir-

- ableproperties includebindingability,

duration and reduced hallucinogenic

Previous medicinal roles still exist
for this versatile drug. As a result of its
broad use in Mazatec culture, it has
been prescribed as a cure for ailments

such as diarrhea, anemia, headaches,
rheumatism and swollen belly.
Thefactthatsalviaisthe mostpow-
erful hallucinogen yet known,‘ legal at

recreational drug consumer.

Let not science die again by the
rigid workings of politics.

Its vision-inducing properties and
psychedelic effects help people free
their minds. Some have likened it to
yoga, meditation and the state of a
trance. Still others note an increased
sense of connection with the universe
and sensations of motion. Alot ofﬁrst-
time users will experience fear.

Thatiswhythereis active legislation
to impede the use and distribution of
this drug.Thisincludes etfortsinzoog

The nature of politics entails that
politicians can’t have any choice but to

For one, LSD and heroine are also

them is guilt by association, afavorite

driven the zombie phenomenon back
into the ground, where it theoretical-
ly originated — “Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies”? Please.

That’s why it is such a thrill to see a
movie zap so much life into the craze’s
rotting ﬂesh. Yes, “Zombieland” is the
re-re-animator of zombie—mania.

Simultaneously hilarious, terrify-
ing, satirical and even brieﬂy heart-
warming, “Zombieland” packs more

pure entertainment value into its

brisk 80-minute running time than '

any other movie I have seen within
the past six months.

Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) —
so-called because of his desired des-
tination —— opens the ﬁlm by giving
the audience a list of rules necessary
to survive azombie apocalypse (“Rule
No.3: Beware ofBathrooms”).Though
initially gimmicky, the creative use
and presentation of the rules, as well
as their repetition throughout the
ﬁlm, sets “Zombieland” apart right
away as a deﬁnite member of the
créme—de-la—zombie-crop.

On his way to Ohio, across a car-
toonishly ravaged Americana land-
scape, Columbus joins forces with
Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) —
the above-and—beyond highlight of
the ﬁlm.Acrude,]ack Daniels-drink-
ing,_tough-as—nails good ole boy, Har-
relson nails the role.Practically ev-
erything that comes out ofhis mouth
elicits at least a smile and, more often

than not, a hearty belly laugh.

The two survivors eventually en-
counter sisters Wichita (Emma Stone)
and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), and
the ﬁlm essentially devolves into a
road trip voyage of sorts. Their desti-
nation is Los Angeles, and when they
get there, one of the greatest cameo
sequences EVER_ occurs. It would be
sinﬁil to spoil it -— but trust that you
will nearly die laughing.

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how
the movie succeeds as well as it does.

   

ﬁlm.

After the mediocre “Adventure-
land,” this makes two theme-park
movies forjesse Eisenberg, and it’s

in a candy—colored amusement park,
isthe equivalent of a cinematic roll-
er coaster — an incredible rush of
adrenaline accompanied by a huge
smile that is over far too soon. Ac-
tually, that could go for the entire

more than once. -’

if 

Themixofwit,slap-stick andsatiri- -   ~

cal comedy sprinkled throughout . 

certainly helps, as does the direc-
tor’s knack for establishing tension in
mere seconds. Perhaps it’s the sheer
humanity of the characters. Stone
and Eisenberg have great chemistry
as two hormonal teenagers with few
options for release. There’s a scene
with Harrelson that will bring a sur-
prising tear to your eye.

Of course, the action sequences

are equally kick a**._ The ﬁnale,‘ set

Gentle

To solve Kakuro, your must enter a number between 1 and 9 in the empty squares.
The clues are the numbers in the white circles thatgive the sum of the solution
numbers: Above the line are across clues and below the line are down clues. Thus,
a clue of 3 will produce a solution of 2 and 1, and a 5 will produce 4 and 1, or 2 and 3,
but, ofcourse, which squares they go in will depend on the solution of a clue in the
other direction. No digit can be repeated in a solution, so a 4 can only produce 1 and
3, never 2 and 2.
