Pitt instructor
alleges black
studies chair
wrongly tried
to dismiss him

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Senior lecturer Rollo Turner alleged he
has been “abused and intimidated” by the
black studies chairperson, who he said
publicly tried to fire him Monday without
permission from the dean of Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

In a memo sent Monday to FAS Dean
Peter Koehler, Turner alleged that Chair
Brenda Berrian told Turner he “should
forget about going to [his] classes because
I have gotten someone to replace you.”
Berrian refused comment.

The conflict occurred because Turner
refused to teach three classes instead of
two, he said. Teaching a third class would

violate his contract, according to Turner..

A lack of respect for his academic
accomplishments also contributed to
Turner’s problem with the department, he
said.

His research on the black community in
Pittsburgh is underestimated because it
has “practical implications” and is not
extensively published in scholarly journals,
he said. According to Turner, he also
“holds the record” for being the lowest
paid full—time faculty member at Pitt, with

,a salary of $37,200.

Turner said FAS has not told him he has
been ﬁred, and he is continuing to teach
his two black studies classes. He has
taught in black studies for 22 years and in
the sociology department for 16 years.

“I am puzzled by such unprofessional
conduct on the part of my chairperson 
Her statements  are ludicrous, if not
bizarre," the memo said. “Should I interpret
her untoward behavior as an emotional

Gunman
robs three

Oakland
merchants

By Megan Bertino

News Editor

Police are searching for an
unknown gunman who
demanded a chocolate ice-‘cream
cone and all the money in the
drawer at the Craig Street Baskin-
Robbins last night.

According to city police, the
gunman is believed to be
responsible for six robberies in
the past two days, including thefts
at Atwood Market and Kim's
Market last night.

Baskin~Robbins employee and
Pitt junior Renee Crespy said the
robber entered the store at about
7:30 pm and ordered a chocolate
ice—cream cone.

After Crespy ﬁlled his order, he
told her had asked for cherry ice
cream, she said. Crespy said he
told her to “open the fucking
register.”

Crespy said he then revealed a
gunundernéath his sweater and
said, “I’m going to blow your
fucking brains out.”

As Crespy handed him money
from the cash register, he
demanded the $20 bills and
continued to threaten her life,
she said.

After receiving the money the
man ﬂed the store, leaving his
ice—cream cone behind.

Earlier that evening Colleen
Thurston was on duty at Atwood
Market when the gunman entered
and asked her for change.

Thurston said he rummaged
through his pockets for several
minutes, told her he had a gun

Campsie resigns from SGB

By Megan Bertino

and Jenna Ferrara
News Editors

Student Government Board
member Abbie Campsie said she
resigned from the board yesterday
because she wants to spend more
time studying.

In a letter to SGB President Gil
Golden, Campsie wrote, “I do
not feel that I could serve the
students of the University of
Pittsburgh properly without
academically suffering.”

When asked to elaborate,
Campsie said, "I have goals after
I graduate  I want to go to law
school.”

Campsie said she reached her
decision after she received her
grades over winter break. “It was
a very difficult decision for me to
make, but I think it was an
intelligent one  I wanted to do

Student Government Board more
than anyone will ever know, [but]
I don’t believe in doing things
half—assed,” she said.

Golden said this weekend the
board will discuss the process for
appointing a new member.

Campsie’s replacement will be
chosen “as soon as we can
possibly do it properly and fairly.
If we choose someone .too
quickly, we might miss a good
candidate," Golden said.

According to the SGB
constitution, the new board
member will be selected by a
majority vote of the existing board
after an interview process.

Golden said the board will
consider various ways to
interview, including an open
forum that will allow students to
meet the prospective candidates
and give feedback to the board.

SGB Judicial Chair Dan Wray

will be acting as secretary during
the interviews to make sure the
constitution is upheld.

Golden said anyone who is a
College of Arts and Sciences
undergraduate with at least a 2.5
quality-point average is eligible
to run for the position.

“People have asked, ‘Why don’t
you look at the other two
candidates [who ran but weren’t
electedl?’ I’m not sure that is the
best way  It doesn’t say we

need to limit ourselves like that in .

our bylaws. The fair thing is to let
everybody try."

But, that won’t stop
unsuccessful SGB candidate Joe
Foner, who said, “I'm very
interested [in runningl.”

Interested students can call or
write to Golden in the Student
Government Board office and
request to be interviewed for the
position. ‘

Maintenance staﬁ"
could lose beneﬁts

By David T. Welch
The Pitt News

Pitt maintenance workers might lose their medical beneﬁts
because of new contract negotiations with the university.

According to Maintenance Workers Local 29 President Jack
Yoedt, Pitt wants its maintenance workers to switch to less
comprehensive health—care programs which are cheaper for the
university.

The maintenance workers do not want to see this plan go into
effect without a significant wage increase, Yoedt said.

“The university is paying approximately $1.7 million a year in
hospital coverage. Their proposal was to give a 20-cents-an-
hour wage increase and a $500 bonus, providing everyone will
move to the Keystone or Health America programs or a new
plan [Which cost lessl,” Yoedt said. “They are trying to get our
people to move to a less expensive program.” '

The Maintenance Workers Union said the new plan the
university is proposing, the Comprehensive Deductible plan,
does not offer the maintenance workers adequate coverage.

Special congratulations are extended to the various chapters of University Greek organizations that collected 1,423 of

For the past nine years, the University of Pittsburgh community has shown its great concern and compassion for others
by supporting the community blood donor program. Although the traditional football rivalry will discontinue in 1992,
it is hoped that the University will uphold the annual Blood Donor Challenge from which so many patients benefit. Main Office: (412) 6484980

Only three days into the semester, Student Government
Board member Abbie Campsie has announced her
resignation due to justifiable time constraints. Claiming
she couldn’t “serve the students of the University of
Pittsburgh properly without academically suffering,” she

announced yesterday that she will not be able to serve on I

the board.
But the selection process to replace her is dubious.
In ‘all fairness, her replacement should be Linda

- Kazmerski, the candidate who came in ninth place during

the November elections.

However according to the Constitution of the Student
Government Board, replacing a resigned member lies in
the hands of the elected board. Campsie’s replacement
will be decided through an application and interviewing
process rather than simply allowing Kazmerski to take a
seat on the board.

The application_ process will be a general one, but the
specifics have not yet been decided by the ’92 board. As
of yet, anyone who has a 2.5 GPA and meets the same
requirements the other newly elected members did has a
chance at the vacant slot. After the application process has

i been agreed upon by SGB President Gil Golden and the

seven members of the Board, they will conduct interviews
with applicants and decide among themselves who the
eighth member will be. ’

/ Not only is this process time consuming, but the results
may prove to be nil. There are obvious ﬂaws in the SGB
constitution if a candidate (like Kazmerski) who
participated in the election process last semester cannot
be given a position on the board.

If this is the way the creators of the SGB constitution
intended for board members to be elected, then why are
10 students forced to go -through the election process
.every fall? Following this precedent, new board members
should be elected by old board members and the point of
an actual election and democracy are moot.

The seven board members who remain arejacob Brody,
Derrick St. Clair, Barbara Rodriguez, Daniel Leichter,
Bryan Bender, Ross Pasquale and Christopher Skutches.
They trusted us to vote for them, but that does not mean
weshould allow them the responsibility of choosing an
eighth board member for us. '

Therefore The Pitt News urges students to complain to
the SGB and inﬂuence a revision of its bylaws. Although
the constitution was not created by the present board, its
responsibility should be to alter these laws so that it can
show an equal amount of fairness to all parties involved.

As always, it is expected that a large ‘percentage of the
student population will be apathetic concerning this
political issue. However if our elected officials are no
longer being elected by us, we will be taking a step away
from the democracy that the voting process is based on.

A similar parallel: If the‘ president of the United States
were to leave his position, the next person in line would
receive the responsibility of fulfilling his duties‘, and so on
down the line. Thus the same should be true of our SGB.

Who ’s to hlozmefor moligestion?

One night over the winter break I sat alone in a
hotel room drinking good beer and watching TV.
A commercial for Mylanta antacid came on. A very
worried, middle—aged man held his stomach and
said the pain was so awful, he was afraid he might
have an ulcer. Fortunately, he relaxed to the

down another spoonful of a wonderful three—bean
salad. « .

I see you women. out there nodding, thinking,
“Just like a man.” Sure, we crush beer cans on our
heads and women call us insensitive clods, but at
least men are open about our competition. Women

said, “With indigestion this bad,

Now this seems_ to be ‘ an

effective way to sell an antacid.
But there’s something else going on here ——
something which happens every day. Competition
might be a good name for it, but that drags all sorts
of Olympic connotations with it. Usually in a
competition, you want to do better at whatever it
is you’re doing. But when dealing with this part of
human nature (or maybe it’s just American or
Western ——I can’tbe sure), the object is more: more
outrageous, more intense, more insane —— more.
The man in the commercial bragged of his horrible
indigestion — his was so bad, it forced him to go to
the doctor. He distinguished himself through his
pain.

Nobody wants to admit they’re in less pain than
someone else because the lesser pain is somehow
delegitimized. (“You know nothing of my painl”)
They feel compelled to buy the strongest medicine
available. So even when a little tummyache comes
from eating too many pierogies, gulp down some
Mylanta and everything will be ﬁne, even if a less
powerful (say, Pepto-Bismol) cure will do.

From this comes a curious parallel, one oddly
mirrored in the nuclear proliferation race: The
medicines are made stronger because those are the
ones purchased. (Buying weaker medicine would
be a sign of frailty.)

The resistance of those afflicted is toughened up
as well because the slightest pain is ﬂooded with
enough “relief” to last the next year and a half.
These two keep climbing up and up and up until
gallons of Mylanta must be forced down some
buffet—eater’s throat so he can belch and force

was it’). But then ask a woman exactly. why she S

needs mascara.

A woman once told me she’d never let another
woman cut her hair because of a fear the stylist
would accidentally-on-purpose make a mistake,
however subtle, which would stain or ruin her
beauty. This woman’s_belief was that no woman‘
can’ ever stand to see another woman be beautiful.

Men act like clods (because they’re supposed to)
because women complain (because they’re
supposed to), .and if women always talk about it
then it must be true because if it weren't true they
wouldn’t talk about it (one of those circular logic
things). Two planes circle around an imaginary
pole, each on the other’s rear and afraid the other
is going to shoot. Who’s going to break the circle?

If something bad happens, somebody’s at fault;
Automatically. However our society (with a cultural
kick from Oprah and Geraldo) has become so
inured to accusations of mere fault that it has to be

jazzed up. Those aren’t troubled kids, they’re 

“satanists.” Those aren’t bad parents; they’re “child
abusers.” People who let alcoholics drink are

I understand the pragmatics of

President Bush and the Reagan

this situation, but I wish that

legacy, I want to ask the
dissenters, “Where have you been
all these years?” for, as Smith
points out, Bush’s recent actions
are nothing new.

Since the Reagan-Bush regime
took office, U.S. foreign policy
has become a private club through
which presidents heap favors
upon the most ruthless of
dictators, and government has
ceased to serve those whose labor
funds it.l...l‘Bush asks that we be
patient with his murderous friends

in China, if only for economic
reasons, while overseeing a “drug
war” in his own nation which
defies economics and the logic of
every lesson learned from
Prohibition and which has made
fashionable the" destruction of
constitutional freedoms.

Yes, Bush freed Kuwait; but
not only did he return to power
a repressive monarch who
chooses to treat women and
foreigners like animals, he sent in
the Army Corp of Engineers to

Bush would stop trying to claim
the moral high ground and admit
his true motivations. Bush’s
management of the U.S. economy
is nonexistent, and now he wants
to aid the finances of nations
such as China and South Africa
— by doing business-as-usual
with thugs. God help us all and
our respective economies!

Inside game keys
 83-74 win at Arena

 By Rob Pugliese
Sta_ﬂ‘W1-iter

The undefeated Syracuse Orangemen have been enjoying the
high-flying adventures of the David Johnson and Lawrence Moten
Show throughout their 10-0 start this season, but last night Darren
Morningstar diffused the explosive act with 21 points and six
rebounds in Pitt’s 83-74 win at the Civic Arena.

,“He killed ‘em,” Miller said. “He shot hooks right. He shot hooks
left. He pump faked, hit foul shots; they could not guard him. He

was the difference in the game.”

“He just went after it; he’s improved immensely,” Pitt head coach
Paul Evans said. “He’s a bonaﬁde Big East center now, and he’s
probably going to be playing at the next level next year.”

Morningstar looked more unstoppable as the game wore on, an
effective one-man wrecking crew against futile defensive efforts by
Syracuse centers Dave Siock and Conrad McRae. The 6-foot, ‘10-
inch senior scored 13 of his 21 points and grabbed all of his boards

 after the intermission to spark the Panthers from a 40-35 halftime
' deficit. ‘ --

Johnson, Syracuse’s 6-6 senior All-American candidate, scored 24 3
points, many of them on acrobatic, off-balance rainmakers against
tough defense by first-year players Chris Gant and Orlando
Antigua. Moten scored 17 points to go with nine rebounds,
including a two-minute stretch late in the second half, when the
rookie sensation pumped in nine points. '

Two consecutive buckets by Morningstar pulled the Panthers
even at the 14:37 mark of the second stanza. A strong second effort
off his own miss brought Pitt to within 46-44, and then he went hard
to the goal, muscling McRae to knot the score at 46 all. A

“Our inside defense was our glaring weakness in this game and
the Boston College game,” Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said._

Not to be overlooked was an outstanding all-around effort by
first-year wizard Jerry McCullough. McCullough pumped in 14

points to go with three steals while houncling Syracuse floor
general Autry into six turnovers with tight pressure.

The Orange lurked within two points until Miller dropped in a
25-footer with the shot clock expiring for a 72-67 lead. The Panthers
controlled the final two and a half minutes by hitting some timely
free throws. Pitt improved to 10-4 , 2-0 in the Big East. The Orange
dropped to 10-1 and 1-1 in conference play. Pitt entertains
Providence Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field House.

Asst. Sports Editor

One is a 6—foot, 10-inch, 250—pound
senior. The other is a 5-10, 160—pound
first-year player. But last night at the Civic
Arena, Pitt’s Darren Morningstar andJerry
McCullough paired their diverse talents
to help Pitt achieve an‘ 83-74 win over
Syracuse.

Morningstar hit nine of 15 shots from
short range, finishing with 21 points and
six rebounds. But the statistics do not tell
the entire story. “Darren did a great job

tonight,” Panther guard Sean Miller said.
“He was the big difference.”

That sentiment was echoed by the
opposition, too. “[Morningstar] was
posting up very strong,” said Orange
guard Adrian Autry, “and we couldn't
double-team him either because Miller

.was on that side and he’d just hit the

three-pointer.”

Pitt head coach Paul Evans assessed
his center’s performance as comparable
to his big game against Kentucky earlier
in the season, when Morningstar had 27
points and 10 rebounds. “In the past, a

lot of people were laughingat him,”
Evans said. “Now he’s a bonaﬁde Big
East center.” -

McCullough, the precocious guard from
New York, added 14 points and three
steals in 20 minutes of action. In a
crucial, four-minute span in the second
half, McCullough buried two three-point
shots and four free throws to keep Pitt
ahead in a tight game.

“Jerry just made great decisions down
the stretch,” Evans said. “He was a big lift
in the second half. "

For both players it was a vindication of

sorts. Miller remarked after the game that
both Morningstar and McCullough had
been ridden by the fans for their play.
“But you've got to give Jerry a lot of
credit,” Miller said. “He’s responded, and
he’s learning.”

For the past two and a half years,
Morningstar has been an object of ridicule
on the court. But now a different person
roams the court.

“He looks slow and clumsy, but he
isn’t,” Miller said. “He’s a quicker person
now, and tonight they could not guard
him.” 0

 

Lady Panthers stop losing skid with win over ‘Nova .

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Much has been made about the
disappearance of the center from
the modern game of basketball.
A limited pool of qualiﬁed players
and the faster pace of the game
today have made the “man in the
middle” a last resort.

The Pitt Lady Panthers (5-7, 1-
2) received sparkling play from
both their starting and reserve
centers last night in a 63-56 victory
over the Villanova Wildcats (4-7,

1-2). Sophomore Jonna Huemrich
scored 18 points and grabbed
nine rebounds, and Carolyn
Miller, also a sophomore, came
off the bench to score 18 as well
on 8-for-9 shooting from the floor.
More importantly than the Lady
Panthers use of the inside weapon
was their halt of a recent ﬁve-
game losing streak and gain of
their first Big East Conference
win of the young season. Losers
of seven out of their last eight, the
Lady Panthers returned to the
Fitzgerald Field House hardwood

for the first time since a Dec. 1

‘loss to the Toledo Lady Rockets.

“This was a big game for us,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said.
“We needed this win real bad.
We didn’t change anything as
coaches. The players just came
out with a different attitude, and
you could tell they wanted to
win.”

After leading 34-29 at the half,
Pitt allowed the Wildcats to pull
ahead by four points with 13:05
remaining. A jumper by first-year

- guard Carol Morton and a layup

by Huemrich pulled them back
even. The Lady Panthers did not
trail after the eight-minute mark,
pulling out in front for good on a
Huemrich free throw with 2:19
left to play. ,

Sophomore guard Erin Maloy
turned in a strong performance
for Pitt as well, connecting on
three out of six three-point
attempts. She added a free throw

to contribute 10 points. Junior.

guard Jill McElhinny added six

points and a team-high four steals J

and four ‘assists. Morton

connected for six points. as well ~

as four assists and three steals.
First-year forward Julie Fornadel
rounded out the scoring with five
points. —
Highly regarded Villanova
forward Nikki Benedix had 16
points and nine boards but was

held to just four points in the

second half. ,

This win comes before Pitt’s
first showdown with newly
added, Big East opponent Miami,
led by nationally touted forward
Frances Savage.

Following the whirlwind month
of December, which featured the
Pitt Invitational, ﬁnals week, a

' desertion and a trip to Puerto

Rico, the Pitt women’s swimming

I team‘ returns to normalcy this

weekend with a dual meet at

, Penn State University.

The PSU women, under the
direction of head coach Bob
Krimmel, own an impressive, 8-1
dual-meet record this season; their
only loss came at the hands of
nationally ranked Michigan. The
1991 —’92 season marks the Nittany

"No Gimmicks-Pure and Simple ,
Why go somewhere else when the 1

Lions’ swimming debut in Big
Ten competition.

For Panther head coach David
Belowich, Penn State’s strength
lies in its overall team talent.
“They’re 15th in the country right
now,” Belowich said. “T hey’re
very deep and don’t have a weak
event"

Belowich anticipates the month
of January to be the team’s
toughest yet. “We have our work
cutout for us, as far as the rest of
our schedule is concerned,”
Belowich said. “Three ofthe next
four dual—meet opponents (PSU,
Villanova, Ohio U) are ranked in
the Top 25 nationwide.”

Pitt swim teams return to action

The Pitt head coach said he

hopes the team returns to the -

form it displayed in the Pitt
Invitational. “I’d like to see us be
where we were at the
Invitational,” Belowich said. “If
we could bridge the holiday gap,
I’d be satisfied.”

Though the Pitt women finished
a distant seventh in the
Invitational, the results are
misleading. The team had 93

7 percent of its seasonal-best times

and had 14 lifetime bests. “We
swam at the Invitational about as
well as we could,” Belowich said,
“given the fact that we didn’t rest
much before the meet.”

One Pitt swimmer who stood
out at the meet was Christy
Knobloch. The energetic Tampa,

  

Fla., native qualified for four finals
—— more than any other Pitt
swimmer. Quite impressive for a
first—year athlete. “She had a
couple of lifetime bests,”
Belowich said about Knobloch.
“It was a performance that was
very well done.”

Following a two-week break
for Christmas, the team headed
for Puerto Rico for 11 days of
training and tanning. The trip
included dual—meet wins over
Puerto Rico University and
William Patterson (N.J.) to
improve Pitt’s dual—meet record
to 4-2.

Looking back at the team’s first-
half effort, Belowich said he has
few qualms. “Ifanything, I would
like to see a few more individuals

Belowich said.

In other disheartening news,
distance swimmer Jill Comeau
quit the team and is no longer
enrolled at Pitt. Belowich hopes
Laura Zdyb will step up and
replace her.

The Pitt men enjoyed a
December to remember. First the
Panthers dominated the Pitt
Invitational by besting national
powers Harvard and Miami of
Fla. Later in the month the men
swept two dual meets in Puerto
Rico while also swimming an
average of 110,000 meters per
athlete. (That’s 75+ miles!)

In the Pitt Invitational victory,
the Panthers received eight NCAA-
meet considerations, set one Trees
Pool record and six meet records.
Leading the way with a stellar
effort was first—year swimmer Matt
Brady, who set school records in

Crcidle’no
hand jive    

By Ross Pasquale
The Pitt News

“The hand that rocks the cradle is
the hand that rules the world,”
according to an old wives’ tale, and
in Curtis Hanson’s Tbe Hana’ Tbat
Rocles 7779 Cradle, the owner of that
hand is trying desperately to rule
her world by destroying her rival
and usurping her mother—wife role.

Rebecca De Mornay stars as

I Peyton, the innocent-looking (and

sexy) nanny who has insinuated
herself into the lives of the
unsuspecting Claire and Michael

Bartel. What they don’t suspect is  

that the psychopathic Peyton has
sworn revenge on Claire for her
role in the death of Peyton’s
husband. I

The pregnant Claire (Annabella
Sciorra) wasa patient of the late

» gynecologist Dr. Mott and brought

charges against him for alleged
sexual molestation during a routine
checkup (every woman’s
nightmare);

Michael (Matt McCoy) urges his
wife to testify (it bothered me that

, she had to be urged), and other

patients follow suit. Dr. Mott

commits suicide to avoid the wrath  ji.

of the law and his young, pregnant
wife, Peyton, soon miscarries. Her
assets frozen by the state because
of the multiple lawsuits, Peyton has
nowhere to turn — until she sees
the face of Claire Bartel on television
(as the first woman to testify against
her late spouse) and commits herself
to ruining Claire’s life.

Bouncing into the Bartels’ lives
rather innocently, De Mornay has
no trouble appearing to be a benign,
sweet and helpful nanny.

She becomes young Emma’s best 4:.

friend, complete with a “secret club”
and signal, gets the Bartels to fire
their other hired help and makes
Claire suspect that her husband is
having an affair with a childhood
girlfriend.

Surprisingly, De Mornay is also
extremely convincing as the violent
and vengeful psychopath who
assaults a young boy that teases
Emma (by bending the youngster’s
arm back and threatening to “knock
his head off’) and also lays into the

‘retarded gardener Solomon (Ernie

Hudson), the only one suspecting

her duplicity. I wasn’t expecting
much from Risley Business’ sex
object, but it was really ingenious
casting.

Her Ivory girl good looks are
markedly different from her
frightening mean streak,
especially after she thrashes a
bathroom stall as a tension-
breaker.

She also makes it appear that
the childlike Solomon has been
molesting Emma (Madeline Zima)
after he sees her nursing the
Bartels’ infant son. No wonder
he’s notdrinking your milk, Claire.

Speaking of Claire, Sciorra is
the same actress who made a
splash in such films as Internal
Aﬂairs, Reversal of Fortune and
most recently Spike Lee’s jungle
Fever.

Her character is slightly
reminiscent of the same-named
supermom played by Anne Archer
in 1987’s FatalAttractz'0n, Sciorra
seemed to be teetering on the
brink of incompetence as the
aSthma—ridden Claire.

Was it the writing making her-

alternately unsure and spunky or
Something more simple, like the
fact that these characters are all
just blocks of marble in the hand
that rules the cinematic world —
that of the successful commercial
sculptor? A

In order for the plot to achieve
its aim (the inevitable “we’re alone
in the house at night with a
psycho”), Claire must be weak,
Peyton must be strong and the
man in the middle must look the
other way.

Julianne Moore makes a big
impression as Michael’s Smarmy
boyhood friend, Marlene.

Her character fits well into the
fabric of the plot, and her distaste
for upper ‘middle-class com-
placency contrasts nicely, if not
shockingly, with Claire’s attitudes.
Moore is an actress to keep an
eye on.

McCoy, as Michael, a genetic
engineer and yuppie if ever there
were one, is about as wimpy as

‘his Michael Douglas counterpart

in the aforementioned Attraction.
Although there is some
speculation about whether De
Mornay will land him in the sack,
about all the plot this one-note
character is delegated deals with
one or another aspect of his

His broken limbs during the

Studs, not spuds in ‘Private Idaho’

By Mark Smith
Staff Writer

“You’re living in your own
private Idaho” is an early B-52'5-
song chant. My Own Private
Idaho is a queer film from offbeat
director Gus Van Sant. (There is
no relation between the two.)

Ida/J0 opened nationwide with
critics’ approval in late November,
although Pittsburgh was treated
to a special showing of the film as
a sneak preview during the
Pittsburgh International Lesbian
and Gay Film Festival in October.
Amazingly, it drew over 500
people without any advertising.
Thankfully, Pittsburgh Film-
makers has brought Ida/70 back
to Pittsburgh.

The originality and depth of
Van Sant’s previous works, Mala

Nocbe and Drugstore Cowboy,
generated anticipation for the
release of My Own Private
Idabo months before its release.

Van Sant has a story to tell
through film; each each film
adding to a collected piece. In
Idaho, the narrative can be read
as a search for home. Mike
(River Phoenix) is a hustler living
on the streets of the Northwest,
searching for his mother who
abandoned him during
childhood.

Mike’s friend and keeper, Scott
(Keanu Reeves), travels in this
world without rules. Scott is the
son of Portland, Oregon's
wealthy mayor and seems to

_ reject his family’s wealth and his

father for Bob.
Bob, the drunken street
leader/older hustler is the vehicle

for the co-optation of Shakespeare’s
Henry/IV on the screen, while Scott
is a modern day “Prince Hal.”

Hustling, prostitution and
thievery are not glamorous lifestyles
(recall Pretty Woman), but Bob,
our anti—hero rogue, gives Ida/70 a
medieval ﬂair that lends to the
film’s mood.

Central to Van Sant’s storytelling
is the use of Mike’s ailment,
narcolepsy, a biological condition
that puts Mike to sleep. Sometimes
the involuntary snoozing puts Mike
in difficult situations. Van Sant
merges Mike’s dream world with
the “real” world. While the “dream”
world is the only place for love and
sex., in the real world of these
hustlers, sex is a given.

Van Sant conjures the bizarre on
the screen —— from Mike’s distorted
longings for his mother to the
manifestation of a sex-shop’s rack
of gay male porn to provide lively
dialogue. _

On its face, young men having
sex with older men for money
sums up Idaho for the cable-TV
guide column. It’s not that simple.
This is an offbeat film that will take
you by surprise. Disjointed and
moody, My Own Private Idaho is
playing this month at the Fulton,

TI-IE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 9, 1992

By Larry Chough
Stajf Writer

Some of Pitt’s best actors/
comedians may be sitting right
next to you — if you’re at the
Friday Night: lmprov, the land of
audience participation and
improvisation in the basement of
the Cathedral of Learning.

Pitt’s lmprov, hosted by Jeff
DeVincent, offers spontaneous
situations, where participants are
chosen by volunteering or at
random by the master of
ceremonies to improvise on

particular situations suggested by ~

RECOVERY

members of the audience. The
evening’s events may include a
“Freeze” game, storytelling time,
a theatrical or movie-genre role-
playing game, a sing—along, a
spoof on radio shows of the
19405 or even musical
performances or poetry recitals.

The Freeze game consists of
two people who are given a
certain, most likely embarrassing,
situation. The couple is then
required to act out the given parts
as best as it can improvise. The
bit doesn’t necessarily have to be
comedic, but the general trend
follows in this vein.

At any given moment during
the Freeze game anyone from the
audience can yell “Freeze!” and
take the place of either actor and
the position that he or she may be
in at the time. Then the person
must initiate a new sequence of

_events with an entirely new

situation. —

Examples of the kinds of scenes
improvised in the Freeze game
may start with an American
reporter interviewing a Russian
consulate on a front porch, with
the catch that they’re both naked.
Now try to imagine this scene

eventually being transformed into

"an imitation of Billy Crysta1’s

Fernando interviewing Howdy
Doody. Then try to imagine the
scene being transformed yet
another time into a debate
between the original “Star Trek’s”
Captain Kirk and “The Next
Generation’s” Captain Picard,
about whom the starship
Enterprise actually belongs to.
The next scene could be yours if
you have the guts to call out
“Freeze!” You’re encouraged to
do it because at the lmprov, it’s
OK to fail. If anyone boos you,

you can be sure that he or she 

will be the next one up.

The storytelling section of the .
show starts with two people being -. ‘I

section, the storytellers will pick

Spontaneous sparks fly duringFriday Night Improv

 

rm; pm NEWS, Thursday, January 9, 1992

   
 
   
 
 
 
  
 

. Continued from page S-5
"Jump,-” puts two people center
_stage (or on the floor in this
’ case), where they act out another
,’audience—suggested scenario.
"However this time they’re under
the restriction of having to
. : improvise in the spirit of whatever
"genres the host decides to call
'1 out. Try to imagine a couple
.. trapped in an igloo during a
, ‘theatrical musical or during a

-.  Japanese B—movie of the ’60s.
_ Every once in a while the host
_ ' of the Improv will invite everyone
to walk down the nostalgic past
of ’70s television by singing
I rounds of “The Love Boat” or

“Laverne and Shirley.” You'd be
surprised to find out how many
of the lyrics you actually know.

Another musical aspect of the
night requires the basic two
people under another audience
scenario to improvise the scene,

H but they’re restricted to only using

song lyrics in their verbal
communication.

One section of the Improv lets
a larger group of people improvise
to a certain situation. This is the
section entitled “Radio Days.” It
requires enough people to fit the
bill of a narrator, a sound—effects
person and the group of necessary
actors to play the parts of the

characters. One week’s show was
based upon a detective show —
complete with a hardened
detective, a femme fatale and a
devious villain.

Pitt’s Friday Night Improv was

brought to Pittsburgh three years

ago from the Northern University
of Illinois by Jeff DeVincent.
DeVincent, who is currently in
his third year of graduate school
toward a master’s degree in fine
arts, initiated the Improv at Pitt in
the fall of 1989 with an intimate
number of about 25 dedicated
actors.

“It’s the only audience-
participation improv anywhere,”

DeVincent said. “Improvisation
is a wonderful exercise for the
mind, and it’s open to anybody
who wants to come.”
DeVincent added that, “The
idea that failure is OK is also a
unique aspect of our Improv.”
The second year of the lmprov’s
existence began to draw more
people from all walks of life and
from all around the area.
DeVincent noted that participants
from all of the major campuses,
such as Carlow College and
Carnegie Mellon, attend as well
as people who have been out of
school for quite some time. In

addition to the widespread appeal
of the Improv, the variety of
participants include rion—actors.

“We have a wide range of
people who participate in the
Improv, from members of the Pitt
diving team to psychology
majors,” DeVincent said. “The
Improv is definitely not restricted
to actors only.”

DeVincent, with the assistance
of an Improv board, comes up
with all of the unique skits. Some,

like the Freeze game, are carried

on from week to week, while
others, like a soap—opera parody

called “Southside,” eventually
fade out of the regular lineup of
events. While some events remain
consistent from week to week,
the Improv is constantly
changing. DeVincent said the
board always tries to come up
with something new to improvise

upon.

Although DeVincent_ rarely
participates in the actual
improvisation himself, he did say,
“The role of the host is in itself a
character.”

Another aspect of the Improv
that is extremely important to its
participants is the high integrity
of the actors" in not portraying
their characters in stereotypical
molds in order to not offend
anyone in the audience. If a
stereotype somehow becomes
incorporated into the course of
events, the actors try to take the
stereotypes and blow them up to
show how absurd they are.

Now in its third year, the Improv
plays to a jammed house where,
for about an hour and a half on
Friday night, you can play a role
that you always dreamed of or
one that someone always
dreamed of watching you play.
The Improv Regulars

Oftentimes, especially when a
new idea _is being introduced,
the Improv will rely on the
seasoned veterans or regulars to
start and drive the momentum to

may build up the courage to
participate.

In addition, many skits,
especially during the Freeze
game, have become quite familiar
to the audience to the point where
the audience downright insists
upon its portrayal. One regular
who is largely responsible for the
success of many of the traditional
skits at the Improve is master’s—
of—fine—arts graduate student
David Fielding.

The audience most often greets
Fielding, who is most noted at
the Improv for his impersonations
of Captain Kirk and Fernando,

with a resounding ovation for his
well—known skits.

As Fernando, Fielding will
randomly pick members of the
audience and identify them as
the celebrity they resemble most.
He will then address his Freeze
partner as a specific character,
such as Howdy Doody. As Kirk,
he always seems to have a chip
on his shoulder when it comes to
his starship. In fact, Fielding
cannot escape these characters.
On Halloween, he dressed as
Kirk and was forced to do his
impression over 10 times.

Fielding uses his experience as

both an actor and a regular to
help his improvisation partner
when he or she is at a loss for
improvisation.

“I try my best to save a situation
by getting them to follow my
1ead,” he said, “but there are
some situations you just can’t
save.”

Because he is a regular, Fielding
is often challenged by other
participants.“I’ve had people try
to embarrass me,” he said,
“pointing out the fact that I may
be up there too much. We’re
there to have fun, but it's fun to
