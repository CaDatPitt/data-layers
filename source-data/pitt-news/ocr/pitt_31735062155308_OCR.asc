Records reported that lines have been ,relat_ively_ short ‘this week,
even during the expected ﬁrst-day rush. ’

“Registration should take .

only thirty - five minutes,”
said Anthony Athens, assis-

‘tant of student records. “It
should take 30 minutes to

see an advisor and five min-
utes to ﬁll out your cards and
drop them in the mail.”

The beginning-of-term lines in-
to the student records office have
been relatively short. Athens at-
tributes this to an eifort by many

students to take early care of

scheduling problems.

Athens estimates that 60 per
cent of the students in line to
his ground ﬂoor offices were
plamiing to repeat courses which
they had failed during the fall
term. Approximately 20 per cent

‘ were seeking change of course

Greensburg Campus Plans

Move to Old Lynch Estate

The University of Pitts-
burgh at Greensburg is plan-
ning a $7,500,000 building
program on a new campus
site two miles‘ south of
Greensburg, announced Eric
C. Summers, chairman of the
Greensburg Campus Advis-
ory Board and vice-president
of West Penn Power Com-
pany.

The 104-acre Charles Mc-
Kenna Lynch estate which
was acquired by the University
in June, 1964, will be the new

0 permament location of the Greens-

burg campus, according to Sum-
mers. Eight buildings including
library, laboratory, classroom,
gymnasimum, dormitory and food
service facilities will be erected
on the site.

No Regional Campus
Competition Intended

The University is not going to compete with Pennsyl-
Vania State University for a regional camPus near Ellwood
City, according to Richard Rose, co-ordinator of University

regional programs.

According to Rose, the University will accept as ﬁnal
the decision of the Council on Higher Education, a division
of the state government. Last month, hearings were held

Monday evening that Dean
of Students Helen {Pool Rush
will succeed Dr. Alan C. Ran-
kin as acting vice-‘chancellor of
student and general affairs.

Later that evening, however,
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
announced, “I have reached no
decision on this matter.” The
Pitt News’ sources stated that
Dean Rush would "replace Dr.
Rankin on aniinterim basis until
a permanent successor is named.

sity on July 1 to become presi-

State and the University pre-
sented their respective cases for

Ellwood City area.

Rose expects a decision from
the Council in early February.
All plans ‘ for a University re-
gional campus at Ellwood City
will be held ‘in abeyance until
the decision is announced.

Rose emphasized that the Uni-‘
versity “doesn’t have the re-
sources to compete -and I don't
think Penn State has the re-

sources to compete either. We,

want one strong campus in this
area.”

While Rose stated that the Uni-
versity would not ﬁght for this
regional campus, he explained
that he had no control over the
actions of the citizens of Ellwood
City.

The citizens seem to want a

regional campus in ‘their city, '

The County Property Assessment Board
and the University are continuing their has-
sle over whether Chancellor Edward H.
Litchfield should or should not pay taxes on
his 36-room Shadyside mansion. .

During a recent hearing, the Board
made no decision after reviewing a Univers-
ity petition to remove the estate from the
tax rolls. The Board had previously claimed
that the estate goes beyond a mere residence
and should be at least partially taxable.

It did indicate, however, that it may retain a
part of the property on the tax list because the
third ﬂoor is not lived in. .

At the hearing, George W. Richards, Jr., Uni-
versity counsel, said that with the growth of uni-
versities there has been an enlargement of their
“functions, frontiers and objectives.” _The head of
a university, he said, represents its “image” and is
its official host.  . . 9 . ~ 0 - 1

The Chancellor's residence is located in War-
wick Terrace, above Fifth Avenue, in a section for-
merly called “Millionaries, Row.” The University
bought the mansion in 1961 for $150,000 from H.
J. Heinz, II, chairman of the Heinz food-processing
ﬁrm, and spent $100,000 on remodeling. Heinz paid
the University $50,000 for paneling and other items
he removed from the mansion.

The house is now taxed at $180,000, but the
Board does not think that the Chancellor needs 36
rooms and ﬁve acres and is acting on that premise.
The Litchﬁelds, their four children and a nurse-
lmaid. occupy the second floor, which has six bed-
rooms. The 12 rooms and two bathrooms on the

;third ﬂoorare being used for storage.

Also representing the University at the hearing
Vice Chancellor Lawrence L. Monnett, Jr., Capt.
William G. Fisher, physical plant director, and G.
Stanley Rupp, treasurer. , ,

Monnett listed 42 events held at the Litchﬁeld
home in 1963 and 1964 and attended by 3,384 guests.

These ranged in size from a -dinner for -eight to -a

 

‘“WomeI,1?s.. tea, attended -by_‘-950..

 

Scheduled for completion in

1967, the campus will provide
initially for a full-time enroll-_
ment of 1,000 students. Building
plans have been drawn up with

the prospect of future growth of V j

1,500. The current enrollment of
full-time students is 142.

The $7,500,000 cost of the ini-
tial phase of the development‘,
program will be ﬁnanced in part

by a region-wide campaign for '

public support and in part by
government funds such as those
available under the Higher Edu-
cation Facilities Act of 1963.
Summers emphasized that the

element of public support to the A

extent of $1,500,000 will be neces-
sary in order to, apply for fed-
eral matching grants and loans.
Summers expressed conﬁdence
that the money could be raised
through local initiative, since
the new campus will be an edu-
cational, economic and cultural
asset which will beneﬁt every-
one in the area. He also pointed
out that the University’s other
regional campuses in Bradford,
Johnstown, and Titusville, have
all experienced successful build-
ing campaigns within the last
three years. '

The Greensburg Campus Advi- ’

sory Board, composed of 25 busi-

noss and civic leaders from the 

Westmoreland - Fayette ' Counties
area, is already moving ahead

_ With plans to appeal to all in-

dustry. business, and individuals
in the area the Greensburg Cam-
pus serves.

It is hoped that construction
of the new campus buildings will
begin in spring, 1966, and that
the ﬁrst phase will be completed 1
by fall, 1967.

Interviews:

 

By LARRY BERNFELD

“Little Richard” has returned
to the entertainment ﬁeld after
a four year absence. A cheering
Pittsburgh audience of 13,500
voiced their approval of this fact
at the Civic Arena on December
28.

“A new generation of teen-
agers has grown up since I
started singing professionally back
in 1955,” Richard Penniman said.
“Most of them don’t know me.
But once I get out there and go
to work on the piano, their re-
actions change." _

Little Richard, inthe past,‘ was
a solo performer. Today, on his
return, however, he brings with
him a 30-man revue. “People like
to see a show, not just one man;

_it builds up excitement,” Penni-

man explained. And a show is
just what Little Richard puts on.
Backed up by an eight piece
band, his entrance is preceded by
a few warm-up numbers done
by Larry Lester, a young scream-
er in baggy yellow pants, and by
a quartet called ' the Four T’s.
Little Richard then comes on
ﬂanked by “Buckingham guards”
in full regalia carrying two ﬂags

‘Little Richard’  

 

LITTLERICHARD

—the United States’ and his own
personal ﬂag.

Little Richard performs in a
silver-sequined cape, silver pants
and a Louis XIV. shirt. Throwing
his cuff-links and ascot to mem-
bers of the audience, he then
proceeds to sing a medly of his
old hit tunes, one of which
(“Long Tall Sally”) has sold

 
  

STUDENT OPPOSITION notwithstanding‘, the City of Pittsburgh has

installed parking meters on Fifth Avenue, Bigelow Boulevard, and in
Schenley Plaza. Proponents of the plan insist that the meters beneﬁt
the students, because of a greater daily turnover.

“My message is excitement,”
he said. “I may jump on the pia-
no or down into the audience.
There ain’t no telling what will
happen with me.”

Little Richard has given col-
lege performances at U.C.L.A.,
Georgia Tech, Georgia College,
and at A and I State in Nashville,

Tennessee. “With a college audi- '

ence I get a chance to do some
folk tunes and ballads; something
I can’t do at a big stage show.”
Penniman has observed that
many college students won’t ad-
mit that they like Rock ‘n’ Roll,
“but once the music starts, you
can look over to them and most

- of them are tapping their toes.

Rhythm is the key to music, and
it can attract any age group."

A Negro performer with an
all-Negro revue, Little Richard
commented, a little surprisingly,
that his following is predomin-
antly white. “Fats Domino is an-
other Negro preformer whose fol-
lowing is largely white.” In his
recent touring, he has experi-

enced racial discrimination only’
once, and that was in a hotel in

Washington, D. C. “My manager
is .a white man from Georgia
and we have been ‘rooming to-
gether this whole tour.”

Richard Penniman is a man of
strong religious feelings. In fact,
it was his religious orientation
which accounted for his absence
from the entertainment ﬁeld. He
comes from a Macon, Georgia,
family in which his grandfather
was a._ minister. Leaving the sing’-

 profession to fulﬁll a. “long-.
A- standing desire to study "theology,
-. he entered Oakwood College in

Huntsville, 'Alabama, where he

' received his B.A. “ -

His return to singing was no-

. where hailed louder than in Eng-

land by the Beatles. who openly
and ardently profess their admir-
ation of the Little -Richard style.

Reviews:

By CHRIS MARTIN

December 28 was moving
day at the Civic Arena in
downtown Pittsburgh. Mov-
ing out Was Russia’s health
exhibit and showing in was
local radio station KQV’s rock and
roll show and a capacity audi-
ence.

Two acts highlighted the show,
the Little Richard Revue and the
Four Seasons. The Four Seasons
were accorded the privilege of
appearing last, the position usual-
ly reserved for the most popular
act. True, they did receive the
most applause but the real ex-
citement of the evening came
during the Little Richard Revue.

The two and a half years that
the Four Seasons have been sing-
ing together was reflected by
their polished performance as
they sang both their‘ own hits
and other numbers. After abbre-
viated versions of “Stay” and
“Since I Don’t Have You,” the
four and lead Frankie Valli
launched into their three biggest
hits “Sherry,” “Big Girls Don’t
Cry,” and “Walk.” The applause
was the loudest and most sus-
tained of the evening, but the
enthusiasm provoked by the Lit-
tle Richard performance was not
there. -

The Executives (minus leader
Jimmy Ford) serving as house
band helped singer Vic Dana
with his hit “More.”. The singer's
clear, smooth tones were also evi-
dent in another hit of his, “Shan-

movements of the audience. His
best songiof the evening, “Pretty
Women,” had a good heat and
good back up on bass guitar and
drums.

Another male singer meriting
mention was J onny Tillotson, Un-
fortunately, he began out of his
medium —— ballads and medium
fast songs — by singing “Johnny
B. Goode." He redeemed his per-
formance, however, when he
sang “Poetry in Motion” .and his
current record, “She Understands
Me.”

Sharing the M.C. duties with
the disc jockeys was Bobby Ry-
dell of stage, screen, and ’64

Homecoming fame. He comment- .

ed during rehearsal that he had
not decided what he would sing
in performance. His choices were
“Wild One” and “Forget Him.”
Rydell was also able to excuse

   
 

.«.

himself into a good drum duo
with his drummer Carl Natola,
+ the “C J.am Blues,” which he had
also performed at Homecoming.
The Petites, a group as young
as their name indicates,‘ were
plagued both by a. lead singer
who screamed oﬁ-key and a pro-
pensity for coming in two keys

lower than the back-up band. The A

band, the Fenways, did little to
help the group’s plight by occa-
sionally drowning them out.
Reperata and the Delrons didn't

ances by Ronny Dove, Ray Peter-
son, and Bobby Martin. A

 . remodeled at a cost of $100,000, and presently taxed at ‘a $180,000 value — allto supply
36 rooms-and ﬁve acres to house the Litchﬁelds’ family of six and a nursemaid. But

the University stand, of course, is that a mansion of this elegance is needed for" the

as head of the University.

ii‘: .2 Chancellor’s required entertaining (he hosted 3384 guests in 1964) and his “image”

Primarily, the first floor of the house and the extensive grounds are used for en-
tertaining. What the’ Board is complaining about, and justifiably so, is that the Litch-
ﬁelds’ private quarters on the second-floor would fall under this exemption as well as
the twelve bedrooms on the third floor used for personal storage‘.

Sources did not explain why the Chancellor moved from his 15-room home on
Beechwood Boulevard, but the fact that so much space in his new home should be tax
exempt merely because it is associated with the total image of the mansion seems to

 _, have no economic rationale. Lawrence Monnett, assistant chancellor of business affairs,
0, admitted that Schenley Hall, Bruce Hall, and the Cathedral are large enough for these

social functions but had no home-like atmosphere. But the request for tax exemption
on such a magnitude of property seems to include a few more assets than required for

hominess.

The 1962 Supreme Court exempted the Chancellor’s old Beechwood Boulevard

. residence from taxation but that house was less than half the size of the Warwick man-

sion. What the County’s case may come to is deciding whether to release tax on the
total image or just on the actual space functioning in a school-related capacity.

' We cannot support releasing the tax on the total image and will be surprised if
the University can honestly account for the school-related function of each part of the
new home, including the second and third ﬂoors. It seems doubtful that the Chancellor

will win this one.

I The beginning of term
usually finds many students
complaining about their
swollen toes. With due cred-
it to Student Records, the
student has been left with
little room for legitimate
complaint.

IT IS TRUE that the

 student had many zeal

gripes in the past. Until
1959 registration was a cir-
cus." The University operat-
ed on the semester program
and a luxurious four days
were alloted to a registra-
tion run-around which took
place at two locations — the
Syria Mosque and the Com-
mons Room of the Cathe-
dral. The entire student
body presented themselves
at these two sacrificial al-

I » tars where last rites were
. administered by .unfortun-

ate priests known as gener-
al= advisors. A general ad-

change for_ an 

  
 

moniously appointed seer
and overseer for the four-
day period. Intimate knowl-

edge of the curriculum was

never required and seldom
possessed. Consequently reg.
istration grew to be fear-
ed with a greater intensity

than the ancient ordeal of ,

fire and Water‘.

The advent of the tri-
mester system and the elim-
ination of the Syria Mosque
marked some improvement.

.Four days could no longer
"be spared from the term

and the students had only

one huge set of lines in

which to lose themselves.
Change - of - course action
meant filling out a set of
11 IBM cards going through

a minimum of‘ two more’
lines, and the -inevitable‘

waste of time.

More recently, earlier
registration and the use of
the mail has eliminated
many problems. Change-of-
course no longer entails
lengthy lines and IB M
cards. In its place is the pro-
cess of re-invoicing. The
new invoice. made out in
triplicate, has for its front
sheet a ditto mat contain-
ing the student’s name, ad-
dress and schedule. The
IBM cards are made from
the ditto mat and distribut-
ed to various offices around
the University to help them
in locating students.

l  Frankie’s Forever

 By 305 Smizik

_While thousands of students romped in the snow, play-
ed. in the sun or loafed in the house during the between-
trimester break, this reporter and a small band of likewise
dedicated students worked almost unceasingly to find a
solution to what has to be the most disturbing problem to
face the Pitt student . body _in the past four years, indeed
W -  not in-the history of this Univers-

1 y.

  
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
  

N 0, we did not work out a solu-
, tion to the University’s ﬁnancial di-
 lemma, nor did we tackle the problem
of off-campus housing for women
over 21. These problems are insigni-
ﬁcant standing alongside the mo-
mentous issue we tackled. -

Our group, The Society for the
 Prevention of Dismantling Gustines
A. (SPDG) work at, as the name -iIn-
‘ plies, a plan which would permit that
fortress of student life on Forbes
Avenue to remain, despite the vicious face-lifting being
planned for that area by the unsentimental, unrealistic
University planners.

SMIZIK —

A BRIEF HISTORY of Gustines is needed to help read-
ers to better understand how vital this problem is to stu.

- dent welfare. Frankie Gustine is a former baseball player

with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Upon retiring he decided to
capitalize on his popularity by opening a restaurant near
the ball park. The restaurant became an immediate hit with
sports fans, but not with students. '

In those days there were no dorms, and campus life was
not centered on‘ Forbes Avenue. The place to be was on
Center Avenue. Either at the Luna, Hannah’s or The Pitt
Pott. However, the coming of the’. dorms switched campus
life down two blocks to Forbes Avenue, or_more specifically,
Gustines, Cicero's and later The Pitt Tavern.

But Gustines, because ‘it was closer to campus, or be-

cause, of. its free and easy atmosphere was and is the top
spot. ‘ ' ~

BUT I AM getting away from my point. The I S,_PDG§
feels the absence of Gustines will drastically decrease the
morale of students at this University and thus make it a
far, far less enjoyable place to-attend. g ‘ v

Being a "tea-totaler myself, many may wonder why I
have such an intense desire to see Gustines remain. Itis
the informality of the place. At what other restaurant is
there a constant ﬂow of insults between customers and
waitresses? Name another eating and drinking place where
the cook is ready and willing to go a couple of rounds with
any given customer. And where can you stand on the table
and sing beautiful ballads on a Saturday night?

V To maintain this atmosphere the SPDG ‘asks that all
students write to Vice—chancellor for Development Edgar
Cale and demand that any plans to level Gustines be thrown
out because they are ridiculous, stupid and would interfere
with the drinking habits of hundreds of students.

1.»; Permits  
Spring Athletes to Play
 Without Studying

n University athletes will be able to compete in spring
sports this year without attending school during the spring
_-trimester. This ruling was handed down by the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference during a meeting in New
York December 11. .

Before the ruling, University athletes had to attend school dur-
ing the entire spring trimester and take a full credit load to be
eligible for sports. At that time, the spring sports programs here suf-
fered, with most of the teams having losing records.

“We had tried to compete under the old system for ﬁve years,”
athletic director Frank Carver explained, “but we just couldn’t do
it. With this new ruling, we’ll be able to effectively competeagain.”

The new rule, designed for all schools under accelerated pro-
grams, provides that any school under an accelerated program may
have its athletes compete after the close of the second term, with
their eligibility for the term ending on the last day in May.

The new ruling also makes it possible for athletes to work in the
summer. An athlete here can now attend school two terms, and play
baseball and work during the spring and summer.

In changing the eligibility rule for spring sports, Carver said
that the ECAC has recognized another fact of life. “This rule w.asn’t
set up to tempt anyone to break it,” he said. “It simply removed a
handicap from the schools with accelerated schedules.” ‘Carver added
that there were now seven such schools in the East.

The motion to pass the new law was made by the University and
seconded by Penn State. It met with no opposition at any level.

Hoopsters Whipped Twice

By FRANK SMIZIK

The Palestra in Philadelphia didn't prove to be
the ideal place for the Panther basketball team dur-
ing the holiday. The competition was too strong
and the hoopsters were swamped by the Wichita
Shockers and the University of Pennsylvania Quak-
ers, in the Quaker City tournament. '

The Panthers drew Wichita in the ﬁrst round
and this proved fatal to the Panthers’ chances of
advancing. Wichita overpowered the Panthers 109-
58. Before the tournament began Wichita was the
number one team in the country and rated as the
pre-tournament favorites.

“Wichita was just too good a team for us,” said
.coach Bob Timmons. “What really killed us was
their second team. The ﬁrst team seemed content
to beat us while the second team was ‘hungry to
score.”

The Panthers’ game was as bad as the Shockers
game was good. They would get free for shots but
they couldn't score. ,

“Our shooting in the tournament was terrible.
Besides Lovett and Syzkowny no one could hit,”

Dave Stallworth (42) in the Quaker City Tourna-
ment played in Philadelphia over the Christmas
recess. The Panthers lost both games in the tourna- ‘
ment. They lost to Wichita, 109-58, and they lost
to Pennsylvania, 71.59.

Timmons explained. “We also had trouble bringing
the ball up court against the Shockers’ press,” said Timmons_

The Penn game was a little closer, but the Panthers again had
trouble shooting. They only shot a little over 30 per cent for both
games. The ﬁnal score against the Quakers was 71-59.

“We were in the game until about the last eight minutes and
then we had to press. When we have to press we get into trouble,”
said Timmons. “We play pretty good for the ﬁrst three-quarters of
a game and then we just fall apart.

“Penn has a terriﬁc guard in J eﬁ Newman and Szykowny did a

good job on him holding him to 12 points but that forward Pollack
killed us with 35 points.”

The high scorers in the tournament for the Panthers were Bob A

Lovett with 16 in the ﬁrst game against Wichita and Larry Szykowny
with 14 in the second game against Penn.

Bucha broke the pool record of
2:24.4 by swimming the 200 yard
Breast Stroke in 2:23.8 and Frank
Pratt bettered the pool record in

Co-captain Andy James led the
Panthers by placing‘ ﬁrst in the

Whoosh! What you almost saw above was the wooliest number in years: Oldsmobile’s 4-4-2. Sporting (and
standard) equipment includes a 400—cu.-in. 345-hp V-8 mill backed with 4—barrel carb and acoustically
tuned, chambered twin pipes. And “sticky” red-line tires. And front and rear stabilizers, heavy-duty
frame, springs and shocks that make lean and sway mere memories. Three transmission availabilities, too,
including 3-speed synchromesh, 4-on-the-ﬂoor and Jetaway automatic. Better hurry over to your Olds
~Dealer’s. The 4-4-2 is a restless beast! (And it's the lowest priced high-performance car in America!)
