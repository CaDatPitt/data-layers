' didn’t cancel classes yesterday, de-

spite the fact that some of Pitt’s
neighbors did.

Point Park and Duquesne’

universities canceled afternoon
classes, but Pitt remained open.
The last time Pitt canceled classes

because of the weather was. two ~

years ago, on Feb. 12.

The National Weather Service
issued a Winter Storm Warning
yesterday afternoon that lasted
until 7 pm. yesterday.

Slushy Oakland roadscreated t

problems for drivers and cleaning

crews. Some Pitt shuttles stopped

running for parts of the day.
“Traffic is heavy and road con-

‘ ditions are marginal,” said travel

and transportation administrator
Vince Johns in a statement yes-
terday afternoon. “Safety is of

paramount concern. It is possible .

that shuttle operations will again
be suspended if road conditions

worsen_.”

Pitt workers helped city of-

ficials combat the onslaught of

slush on Oakland streets.

A Pitt police officer Ron Bennett
said that he didn’t notice an espe-
cially high number of _ emergency

‘calls yesterday, but some prob-

lems did arise.
“There were a couple of is-

‘ sues, mainly on top of the hill”

he said. .
The Pittsburgh Port ‘Author-

._ity experienceddelays across the

city but did not cancel any bus
routes. ”
i“We’re
getting into areas with elevated
routes,”_ said A Port Authority
spokesman Dave Whipkey. i

Pitt student” Lahia Annis-
Christy said that while the busses
were running, they seemed to be
having issues navigating some of
the muckier streets. _ .

“I was like, ‘I 'don’t think
I’_m going to work today,”’ she
said. “So, I got off the bus and
walked.”

The economy might be hurt-
ing, but Pitt professors and advis-
ers insist that there’s no reason
for students to lose hope-

“If your dream .is to go to

New York and work on Wall.

Street, that may not work ‘right
now,” said ].P. Matychak, director
of the Career and Development
Center for the College of Busi-
ness Administration. “Your goal
doesn’t need to change, but your
path to your goal does.’-’

  

 

More than 2 million .people
lost.their jobs in the last four-
months of 2008. The unemploy— .
ment rates’ for recent graduates
with bachelor’s degrees is esti-
mated to grow from the current
3.4 percent to 4.1 percent in 2009
alone, according to ‘the National
Association of Colleges and
Employers, which used statistics‘
from the Bureau of_ Labor Statis-
tics for its analysis.

Until President Barack

.Obama’s $825 billion economic
stimulus "package takes effect,

 

Matychak advises students search-
ing for jobs to start early, readjust
their expectations, network and
be flexible.

chairman of Pitt's economics de-
partment. “There are more peo-

_“If you planned on staying in

Some of Pius brightest minds gath-

their knowledge 

“If you don’t eat enough ﬁber, then
you won’t poop Butif you eat too much
ﬁber, you still won’t poop,” said Pitt stu-
dent Suzie Culhane jokingly

Culhane, a student  for the
Department of Clinical Dietetics and
Nuuition, volunmered at Pitt’s Academ-

ic Rush yesterday to help undecided ma- J

jors learn about the school’s majors
Forty-seven majors had tables at the
event, which included representatives
from academic departments as well as
pre—law and pre—med advisers.
About 200 people attended, said Ca-

- reer Development Oﬁice director; Marv

Roth. . . ‘

The event also included a mock job
fair  real employers, where stu-
dents could practice the skills

“I -didn’t really have any idea what I
wantedtomajorin, solcameheretoget
additional information about some of
the opportunities,” said Marshall Sher;
an undecided freshman.

Sher is interested in ﬁelds relamd to
economics and mathematics and went
to the event because he considered de-
dating a joint major in the two ﬁelds
, When asked if the Academic Rush
convinced Sher to enter that 
major, he said, “Not deﬁnitely, but it’s a
good start’ ’

Representatives ﬁom the various
majors embarked in a ﬁiendly competi-
tion between departments . '

At the -anthropology table, Pitt stu-

But foul trouble and subpar offense plagued
the Panthers throughout the game. The team
saw 24 personal fouls to Villanova’s 14, causing

in the game. Pitt center DeJuan Blair, the na-
tion’s fourth—leading rebounder entering the
game, was limited because of foul trouble and
finished with seven points and eight rebounds.

Pitt led for all but a minute in the first half,
giving up two one—point leads to Villanova at

Upcoming job fair to be quite the doozy

by Estelle Tran
Addlilhlllf New E3itor

The economic downturn affects not
only the job market but also Pitt’s upcom-
ing job fair. .

Pittfs annual spring job and internship
fair, scheduled for Feb. 11 and 12 from 10
a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on the main ﬂoor of the
.\X/illiam Pitt Union, expects to host three
fewer employers than last year. But the real
difference exists in the number of non-
proﬁt and government jobs. .

Monica Varela, a spokeswoman for the
Office of Student Employment and Place-
ment Assistance, said 29 nonproﬁt organi-
zations will attend the fair, 11 more than
last year.

While fewer corporations are signed up
to attend the fair so far,.Varela maintains
that the event still serves as a prime oppor-
tunity for students to find work.

“You can. make the personal connec-
tion, that face—to—face contact,” said Va-
rela. ’

She emphasized that students can make
a. stronger impression in person than they
could submitting an application online.

This two-day event, unlike its fall coun— '

terpart, focuses more on internships and
less on full-time jobs.

On the first day, employers specializing
in technical ﬁelds invite engineering and
computer and information sciences majors
to visit their booths. The second day fo-
cuses on positions for students majoring
in arts, "sciences and business.

Del Monte Foods, Dollar Bank, GE-
ICO and the Internal Revenue Service
signed up to attend. Many local businesses
plan to recruit students and alumni at the
fair, but there are also companies from as
far as California and Texas.

Varela encouraged students to dress as
they would for a job interview and to bring
resumes. .

In general, Varela said that students
should do more to prepare for job fairs.
The Office of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance makes a list of com-

panies planning to attend the fair available
online so. that students‘ can research the

companies beforehand.

Varela said that some representatives at
previous job and internship fairs felt dis’-
appointed that the attendees knew so little
about their companies.

The Career Development Ofﬁce offers
resume critiques, mock interviews, help
with self—presentation, an etiquette dinner
and a program about how to work a job
fair before the event. p

Because this fair targets internship seek-
ers rather than job‘ seekers, the University
sent letters to freshmen, sophomores and
juniors. The Office of Student Employ-

‘ ment and Placement Assistance also ad-

vertises with ﬂiers, slides on the television
screens around campus and, for the first
time, with an event on Facebook. Varela
said that if Facebook advertising proves
successful, the office will advertise for the
fall job fair on Facebook, too. 1

Last fall’s job fair featured 230 employ-
ers, up 100 from the previous year.

Employer: Interview
most important stage

by Alex Russell
For T /.2e Pitt New

Many college students strive for good
grades,.a solid internship and positions in
campus organizations. But these achieve-
ments don’t necessarily guarantee students
a job. .
Laurie Hart, a spokesperson for the
local dentist John W. Hart, said that these
things are great resume builders, but ulti-
mately, it’s the interview that carries the
most weight in the hiring process.

_ “Grades might help you get your foot in
the door,” said Hart, “but the interview is
the deciding factor.” _.

Hart went on to say that while it is good
to have “book skills,” applicants ‘must have
people skills as well. The interview, she
said, showcases a person’s professionalism
and communication skills.

Anthony Pivirotto, owner of the local
real estate agency Bayard Business Brokers,
agreed with Hart.

“The interview is very important be-
cause it gives you a sense of a person’s per-
sonality,” he said.

' But Barb Juliussen, associate director
for Pitt’s Career Development Office, said
it’s important for students to get experi-
ence in the career ﬁeld they would like to
enter.

“Whether it is an internship, a summer
job or extracurricular activities, employers
like to see career-related experience.” said
Juliussen.

Pivirotto said Hart has a valid point,

particularly if students want to go into real
estate, where they’ll work on a commis-
sion. It’s a good idea to have some experi-
ence in sales, he said.

Grace Robinson, owner of Grace
Robinson Insurance Agency Inc., said she
doesn’t concentrate on applicants’ grade-
point averages, but rather on the qualities
that they’ve developed by participating in
orgamzauons.

“We don’t really look at grades,” said
Robinson. “We look more at the extracur-
ricular activities someone’s been involved
in.”

Robinson said that she looks for leader-
ship and team building skills and anything
that will make a potential employee stand
out.

Janet Ryan, owner of Century 21
American Heritage Realty, said that in the
21st century, it’s important to have good
computer, leadership and social skills.

But like the others, she also said the in-
terview is extremely important.

“How well they perform on the inter-
view is essential,” said Ryan. “They must
seem professional.”

juliussen said that students participate in
leadership programs, such as Pitt’s Emerg-
ing leaders program and Outside the Class-
room Curriculum program.

“It makes you well—rounded and shows
that you have more than just classroom
experience,” said Juliussen. “It deﬁnitely
makes you more competitive.”

Every Halloween, newspapers, domestic
life magazines and blogs are ﬁlled with clever
ways to make an innovative costume without
spending much money. The classic example
is the bunch of grapes costume, which only

3 requires several purple balloons and tape.

Nowadays the economy is rough and the
employment market is not looking so good.
Not unlike a cash—strapped parent of a can-
dy—loving kid, it’s time we get creative. This
piece is intended to get those very juices of
invention ﬂowing to show hovig with just a
little abstract  and elbow grease, you
can throw together a new line of work. I
present you with: Creative Job Alternatives
for a Questionable Economy.

1) Economics Blog Herald — With each
new day, we discover a new depth to the
levels of the ﬁnancial mismanagement and
ruin of America. Dire forecasts multiply as
analysts and experts pour over records and

  

 

 

statistics to ﬁght over the subtleties of eco-
nomic thought. Trends are described, lines
are drawn through dots. It’s all quite an elab-
orate affair.

However, it should become apparent
that there is no way for a busypman to keep
track of all the invocations of Keynes, all the
dissections of the failures of the incipient

‘stimulus package. Enter the Economics Blog

Herald.

All you need to do to take up this post
is ﬁnd a sufﬁciently rich or sufﬁciently dil-
ettante client and pitch yourself as a human
economic blog aggregator. With candy-gram
aplomb and knickers, you will ‘run the latest
dispatches from Greg Mankiw, Tyler Cowen
and Alex Tabarrok to your ward’s door. In no
time, your employer will be ﬂuently versed in
a dialogue he only partially understands and
you will have a steady income.

2) Electro Hip—Hop Artist —— Even in
dire straits, people will never stop listening

.to music. What makes a life of fearful un-

employment and bailout anxiety worth living

iifyou can’t do it with ear buds and a steady .

. Music by,
Bach, Brian Eno

and The Beach Boys

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

four—to—the-ﬂoor beat? Music is non—cyclical,
my friends, and that means it’s a cash cow. _
Now, I’m sure everyone’s ﬁrst concern is,

- “Wouldn’t everyone become a musician if it

was easy to do?” Most have watched VH1
documentaries and American Idol enough to
know that it is tough to break into the music
industry.

, However, these stars want to succeed
in pop music, a ﬁeld that, by its very name,
demands you become popular’. Not so with
electro hip—hop. You just need one. hipster
blog, out of a ﬁeldlof thousands, to deem
you the next big thing, and before you know
it you will be banging in club sets betwee
Spank Rock and Ninjasonik. -

Don’t worry about musical talent —- as
long as you can rhyme female anatomy with
Pavement lyrics you will be ﬁne. Get a ﬁtted
Pirates cap, some medium tight jeans and a
neon T—shirt, and you are ready for success.

3) Scruff McGruff Ponzi Scheme.Perpe—

to come by. The costume alone costs about
$1500 and will_or1ly be sold to recognized

an't a job? Just dream up your own

law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, you
have to obtain approval from the National
Crime Prevention Council for every appear-
ance of the lovable dog. It is so legendarily
difﬁcult for private individuals to get the
rights to McGruff that I am sure few readers
haven’t dreamt of what they could do with
the rights to such a costume. V

But for this employment opportunity,
you don’t need the costume at all. First,
move to a rural area and- set up a Web site

claiming that you have obtained a McGruff

through the support of a local_ law enforce-
ment agency Then offer nearby charity or-
ganizations, schools and safety coalitions the
opportunity to buy into a McGruff profit-
share in which everyone donates an up-front
fee and successive regular payments to the
McGruff umbrella organization for the right
to have McGruff at their events and access
to McGruff funds raised by the tough_-on-
crime canine. ' ‘

As the demand for the costume will surely
be less than the c'rime—dog-crazy groups buy-
ing into the scheme will foresee, a few well

Hinton, page 10
crafted excuses will get you out of the public
appearance hang—up. As to the payouts, rural
charity groups rarely have large, emergency
expenses. Therefore, when a group tzties to
‘withdraw a small amount, pay it out of the
' principal. As long as enough groups join, you
will take a bite out of revenue indeed.

4) Endearing Tramp -— As Eddie Vedder
once sang, “I don’t mind stealin’ bread from
the mouths of decadence.” Neither should
you. The world has a proud history of mor-
a1ly—ambiguous thieves: The Artful Dodger,
jean Valjean, Robin Hood. It’s high time
you joined this tradition and started snatch-
ing loaves of asiago bread ﬁom Panera and
scones from Starbucks. Likely, a musical will.
be written about you. What could be better?

Hopefully, these suggestions will help
you in the new market. All you need is a, little

Unemployment has

upsides for everyone

by Molly Green

Colu./n/uL11'

 

There are two groups of people in this
world: the employed, and those wily indi-
viduals who prefer the thrill of living day-
to—day, searching the streets . for money,
stockpiling Market Central apples and or-
anges and constructing elaborate mouse
traps in back alleys — for food and enjoy-
ment! It’s a good life, and, as a long—stand—
ing un—employee, one I plan to protect.

Shockingly, there is a growing under-
ground group of people —— I like to call
them the “Job Snobs” — who seek to tar-
nish the good names of the jobless. The
Job Snobs think that those without jobs
are different, and there is no room for dif-
ference in our modern society. Because of
this, there are those who feel that the Job-
less Movement must be stopped immedi-
ately and at all costs.

One by one I’ve watched my peers suc-
cumb to the Job Snobs’ heavy lists of fury.
One second they’re frolicking happily in
the sweet, grassy meadows of unemploy-
ment, and the next second they’re stuffed
into aprons serving up eggs and grits to
table four.

I had a dear friend —- we’ll call her
Cookie — who once was much like me: A
young, happy girl who had not a care in the
world except to decide what kind of cheese
she wanted on her macaroni.

Then Cookie was sucked into the cold,
cruel world of the service industry. She

traded in our joyous games of Spud in the I

park for an ice cream shop. So it came to
be that Cookie spent her mornings, after-
noons and evenings selling various ﬂavors
of custard and ceramic cat statues to elderly
women, small children and one melancholy
clown who oft frequented the parlor.

Sadly, Cookie’s story is just one of many.
Societal pressures are turning more and
more to the job market at terrifying rates.

People without jobs are being dubbed
“lazy,” “worthless” and little better than the
rats that we enjoy catching so much.

And it’s not just a U.S. trend. Many oth-
er countries in the World are beginning to

, blame their problems on the unemployed.

Afghanistan is blaming the unemployed
for its entire illegal poppy market, accord-
ing to BBC News.

The UK —— contrary to its normal
reputation of being filled to the brim with
cheerful, caring folk — has turned the other
cheek to those without jobs. In a study con-

ducted by The Economist, 30 percent of
British citizens stated that the unemployed
population’s “laziness or lack of willpower
got them where they are today.”

The terrible accusations continue, with
Thomas Seidler, a researcher at the Insti-
tute for Social & Economic Research, actu-
ally blaming unemployment for one of the
most petrifying and widespread diseases of
the 21st century: right—wing extremism.

Seidler compiled three data sets that
show a positive relationship between grow-
ing up with unemployed parents and right-
wing extremism, indicating xenophobia in
particular.

Germany is so ashamed of its unem-
ployed that it is considering removing older
unemployed citizens from its government
unemployment statistics, according to an
Associated Press news brief.

This is ridiculous! Everyone knows that
the root of all our problems is the cow
population. They’re the ones that need to
go!

‘After all these attacks, I feel the obliga-
tion to stick up for my people here and ex-
plain why the unemployed are not nations’
foes, but instead entides that need to be
embraced.

Unemployed people are eclectic. We like
jumping around from thing to thing. Dur-
ing my rather lengthy unemployment I was
highly involved with my community, baked
cookies for the elderly, volunteered at the
Pittsburgh Zoo and watched an extremely
large quantity of television — which is ex-
tremely important for reasons I can’t ad-
equately explain in this column.

Many famous writers, musicians and art-
ists were unemployed. The Job Snobs’ pro-
paganda tells us that this is because those
markets are small and competitive. But
many of these same writers, musicians and
artists become famous writing about their
experiences in the unemployed world.

And what a sweet world it is: no oc-
cupation tax, no bosses, no annoying co-
workers, no money —— thus ensuring that
we don’t get sucked into consumerism and
the like. 9

The fact is we’re a great group of peo-
ple, us un—employees. We go about our
ways and mind our own business. We don’t
judge people who have jobs, so why should
they judge us?

And that’s all I have to say about that.

Upon /nearing z_‘/Jatyon were unemployed, /ya;
anyone ever asked, “Sir (or Madam), are)/on re//—
ing opinrn on z‘/ye black n2anée2‘.?” If 50, reek .mp-

Interviewing not as

hard as many think

by Mike Ploetz
Staff Writer

The art ‘of the effective interview isn’t
as idifﬁcult to grasp as you might think.

By doing your research and dressing
your best, you can instantly go from “ho-
hum hire” to “Hey! This guys on ﬁre!”

That being said, a few core principles
are worth keeping in mind.

Always remember that the main pur-
pose of an interview is to sell yourself to
the employer. Everything you do and say
tells your interviewer something about how

you may (or may not) ﬁt into the company’s‘

plans.

On the subject of clothing, moderation
is key. Of course, you should dress profes-
sionally. For both guys and girls that means
a suit in conventionally neutral and under-
stated tones, but keep in mind that it is pos-
sible to out—dress your interviewer.

Barbara juliussen, the Career Develop-
ment Ofﬁce’s associate director, said appli-
cants should also opt for subtle fragrances
and accents. And try to wear only minimal
jewelry. ’

.Nothing turns off an employer more

than the overpowering scent of cheap co-

logne — well, exbept for the sight of an ugly
tattoo stretching across your arm. Deci-

sions like these will lead the recruiter to

characterize you as immature.

You should also allocate time for re-
search. Some advisers might tell you that
it’s difficult to know what questions your
interviewer will ask.

But Juliussen says that there are certain
questions that interviewers are almost sure
to ask.

Behavioral questions, in particular, are a .

favorite of recruiters. An employer might
say: “Tell me about a time when you solved
a problem that was interfering with your
progress. What did you do?” ,
You’d do best to think of an answer
ahead of time. Remember that_question's
like this one are meant to give you an op-

portunity to discuss your talents and abili— .

lies.

And, juliussen warns, “prepare yourself
for an opening of ‘Tell me more about
you and why you are interested in this po-
siiion.”’ Although this could easily be the
most obvious question employers might
ask, you may also ﬁnd that it’s themost dif-
ﬁcult to answer.’

With this and every question, the main
point is to be speciﬁc. Employers deﬁnitely
do not want to hear blanket statements. In

other words, tell your recruiter something
that you think highlights a few of your
most useful skills and talents.‘ ‘

Juliussen also recommends that stu-
dents prepare three or four questions for

their interviewers. Informative processes .

like interviews work both ways.

“When you_ask questions of your re-
cruiter,” says Juliussen, “it demonstrates
you’ve done your homework.” B

It’s important to know the basic facts
about your recruiter’s company. In most
cases this simply means searching the com-
pany’s name online and visiting its official
Web site.

juliussen said students often make the
mistake of researching too little. Getting
the facts “demonstrates a match between
your skills and the position to which you
are applying.” vi

You should try, she added, to avoid be-
lieving in common misconceptions. Don’t
listen to those who say recruiters are try-
ing to trick you into saying something you
shouldn’t or are looking for certain an-
swers.

It’s true that some answers to questions
are more appropriate than others, and yes,
your interviewer will most likely be listen-
ing and watching you closely, but don’t
think that the interviewer is waiting for you
to slip up.

So what happens when research isn’_t
enough preparation? The easiest solution
would be to conducta mock interview.

A Juliussen frequently conducts mock inter-
views in her ofﬁce.

The mock interview is a simulation of
a real interview that provides valuable in-

" sight. In most instances someone will vid-

eotape the mock interview, and you will
then discuss it with your adviser. 9
Juliussen said that mock interviews “are

‘ an excellent way to observe a very impor-

tant part of an interview: nonverbal com-
munication.”

Nonverbal communication, which in-
cludes every conscious and unconscious
movement you make, is a very good indica-
tion of what you are thinking or feeling at
any particular moment. Crossing your arms
and legs, for instance, usually means that
you are insecure in your environment, and
the interviewer easily picks this up.

Also, avoid covering your .mouth with
your ﬁngers. This can either be taken to
mean that you don’t agree with what your
interviewer "says or that you are intention-
ally withholdjng information. Obviously,

Although a stylish outﬁt alone won’t

doesn’t hurt.

Would you hire someone to deal with
important customers and represent your
company if he walked in for his interview
wearing ill-fitting, stained pants, an unbut—
toned, un—tucked shirt and messy hair?
Probably not.

First impressions are important. You
may have a killer resume, but if you don’t
have the presentation to go along with it,
the conversation you have won’t matter
much. Do you want your interviewer to
be staring in shock at your inappropriate
outﬁt or staring in awe at the intelligent an-
swers you give to his questions?

The typical interview dress code is
business professional, but this can vary de-
pending on the company and the industry.
If it’s a creative field, you may want to look

a bit more relaxed so that you don’t seem

Applicants gain pointswith polished

stuffy. If you’re going the traditional route,
here are a few guidelines to help you land
your dream job (and look great while do-
ing it).

For the gentlemen, business profes-
sional entails a suit, dress shirt and match-
ing tie. Dress shoes should match the out-
fit and be clean and scuff—free. And don’t
forget to make sure that your socks match,
too.

When choosing your suit, it’s best to
choose conservative colors like black, gray
or navy. Steer clear of the color red. It’s
pretty bold and is often seen as a “power”
color. ‘

And remember: no hats, no denim, no
sneakers and no sweats, and take it easy on
the cologne.

Make sure everything ﬁts properly. Tuck
in your shirt, and see that it’s neatly pressed
for maximum impact. Ah, you look like a
CEO ‘already!

Dressing professionally is a little trickier
for women. You don’t want to look frumpy
and boring, but you also don’t want to

A skirt or pantsuit is a safe'bet..And
again, wear conservative clothes that come
in neutral colors. No bright blue or neon
green, please. Underneath your jacket,
wear a button—down shirt in- a coordinating
color or a dressy top with a modest neck-
line. We know you have goodies, but your
interviewer doesn’t need to see them.

And watch your skirt-length. It should
be long enough that you can sit down com-
fortably inipublic. You don’t want to send
the message that you’ll be using skills other
thanthose listed on your resume to work
your way up the corporate ladder.

Your shoes should be a reasonable
height. You shouldn’t look like you’re audi-
tioning toybe the sixth Spice Girl. And like
your suit, make sure that your footwear is
a traditional color and not too flashy. Steer
away from glitter, sparkles and excessive
jewelry and makeup. T

Avoid summer attire. Bermuda shorts

Upilzio/w Editor

 

Chances are at this point in your life, you’ve
tried to write a resume at least once. However,
with the economy in its current state, looking

good among a potential ﬁeld of applicants

has never been more important As job open-
ings continue to decrease, you need to ﬁnd a

. way to stand out from the crowd and make

yourself look like the best candidate for the
position.

This could be clifﬁcult If you’re like most
college students, you probably aren’t the best
candidate for any position. Statistically, you’re
probably a liberal arts major who had a min-
irnum-wage job in high school, maybe did
some community service and had a MySpace
account when you were 13 and didn’t know
any better. Unfortunately, so did everyone
else

So, how do you make yourself look better
on your resume so you can stand above the
rest? It’s easy. All you have to do is lie.

\Well, not lie, exactly. Lying is bad. What you
should do, though, is exaggerate. Take your
relevant skills and experience, and  stretch

them a little so they sound more interesting to

a potential employer. .

For instance, computer skills are basically
mandatoryfor any white—collar job in today’s
employment market But unless you’re a com-
puter science major, you’re likely not too well
versed in Web design and programming. No
worries! '

Remember that mandatory computer sci-
ence class you took ir1 high school that taught
you how to use Excel and PowerPoint? Be-
cause of that class, you can list “Extensive
training in a variety of computer programs”
on your resume. Don’t be too speciﬁc, but be
speciﬁc enough that it doesn’t sound like you
don’t know what you’re talking about.

Or how about those two semesters of
Spanish you took freshman year to pass Pitt’s
mandatory foreign language requirement?
That, my friend, is “One year of training in
Spanish.” It doesn’t matter what grades you
got in the class, because you’re not mention-
ing the actual grade, just how long you had to
endure it

One of thejkey aspects of  your,re-

..

reative exaggeration 
God for resume Writing

sume is to tailor it to the job you’re applying
for. So, for example, if you want to work as a
graphic designer, make sure you count all the
time you spent doodling in your notebooks as,
“Classroom experience in art and design.” But
if you’re breaking into journalism, that MyS—
pace you’ve regretted these past many years is
both “experience publishing for a blog” and
“early adoption of emerging online media.”
The most important  of course, is to
walk the ﬁne line between creative exaggera-
tion and outright lying, the latter being some-
thing you never want to do. If you volunteered
in a hospital when you were 14, don’t say that
you “have previously worked in the health
care industry.” You weren’t being paid, so you
didn’t work. But do say that you “have experi-

ence dealing with hospital patients, equipment

and protocols.”

What you want to concentrate on when
 your resume is accentuating your
strengths and glossing over your weaknesses.
In some ways, a resume is like a careful ap-
plication of makeup: It strengthens your best
features and covers up your worst, all in the
name of helping you make the best first irn—
pression possible.

An experienced resume writer who’s held
a number of jobs and sent out a lot of appli-
cations is somewhat like a master beautician
who knows just how to apply the makeup
correctly. Probably most of us are more like
l'l’1C‘L 5-year-old who went rooting through
Mom’s makeup cabinet, used half a stick of
lipstick and maybe ate a bit of mascara. All
an inexperienced resume does is highlight that

inexpetience and make it all the more glaring.

Creative exaggeration is one technique that
can help your resume look better in a ﬁeld of
similar resumes, just like a Ferrari looks espe-
cially good when it’s parked in a lot next to
an ’89 Civic It’s not that the Civic is a bad car
—— in all likelihood, it will probably need less
maintenance than the Ferrari — but to some-
one  a casual glance, the Ferrari is the
onlyncar in the lot

If you’re not afraid to apply a little gloss
and polish, you can turn a humdrurn resume
into one that employers would jump all over.
All you need to do is take what you’ve done
andmake it sound cooler and more interest-
ing than what anyone else has done. It doesn’t

. matter if it isn’t actually cooler — just like that
makeup, it’s all in the presentation.

Web sites connect employers, job seekers”

by Kelly Thomas
Staﬂ l/Writer

Web sites like CareerBuilder.com and
Monster.com provide students with help-
ful tools to aid in their post—graduation job
searches. However, they don’t replace tradi-
tional methods of getting hired.

Allison Nawoj, a career adviser at Ca-
reerBuilder.com, said that online job search
sites give both employers and job seekers
more access to each other.

“Going online allows you to really spread
your net wide,” said Nawoj. She added that

mfor employers, “One major beneﬁt is‘that
they can get a lot of resumes very quickly”

To some, this may seem to put job seek-
ers, especially inexperienced, recent gradu-
ates, at a disadvantage. Nawoj countered
that no matter where you look for jobs,
the market is competitive, and the key is-to
make yourself stand out.

Brian Heddleston, the employment de-
velopment manager of Pitt’s Career Ser-
vices, said, “As a candidate, you’re just one
of many. Being creative is the best way to

aPP1Y-” ,

Heddleston said Career Services doesn’t
encourage people to use job search Web
sites because companies usually post job
opportunities on their individual Web sites
as well. His advice is to go directly to the
source. Research the company and contact
it instead of working through a third—party
Web site, he said.

Still, job search sites can be useful when
used correctly.

The impersonal nature of applying for
jobs online makes interpersonal communi-
cation a challenge, Nawoj said. She advised
students to follow up their online applica-
tions by calling or e—mailing the company.

“Make sure you’re not forgetting to do
the follow—up,” she said.

Many Web sites like CareerBuilder.com
and Monster.com allow users to create pro-
ﬁles and upload resumes. They also post
tips that tell applicants how to make their
resumes stand out.

Nawoj cautioned that generic resumes
are not likely to make a student attractive to

companies. Applicants, she said," should tai— _

lor their applications for the job they want.
Heddleston agrees. He said that writing

_ a more personalized cover letter addressed

to the proper person is better than simply
addressing the letter “To whom it may con-
cern.”

Because online job postings get so many
responses, some employerslook forlspeciﬁc
buzzwords in their applicants’ resumes and
cover letters, Nawoj said. They scan the
documents for those words, and if they
don’t ﬁnd them, they often move on to the
next applicant.

“Sometimes it’s just a matter of selecting
proper keywords and putting buzzwords in
your resume,” said Nawoj.

In addition, Nawoj advised students to
use more than one job search site and to use
all the resources available to them, not just
the Internet. The key to success is doing a
“combination of everything you can handle,
while still handling a student workload.”

Many students agree that job search sites
are convenient. Pitt sophomore Phil Di-

“The application process was compli-
cated, and the results were mediocre,” said
DiCicco. “I rate Monster a C—.’’ ;

Another sophomore, Nick Kelly, said,
“Nothing beats personal contact.” Despite
low grades, Kelly said he was able to get a
lab job because the employer liked his pet-
sonality.

At the same time, he said that he agreed
that searching for jobs online could open up
doors.

“lid be down to seeing what is available,”
he said. — _.

Although job search Web sites provide
a valuable service, students shouldn’t forget
the basics of applying for jobs: Make your
resume stands out, tailor it to the position,
and always follow up with the company af-
ter submitting an application.

“I think [job search sites] are deﬁnitely a

, beneﬁt to all people applying,” said Nawoj.

Greek fe - V PATH TO THE FU’T'U'IRiljI~1
helps students     
network

.,- by Sam Seaman
For Tbe Pitt New
Members of Pitt's fraternities and sorori-
ties boast on their Web site that 48 percent
of all U.S. presidents went greek in college,
as did 42 percent of U.S. senators and 30
percent of all Fortune 500 executives.
But will joining a fraternity or sorority in
college really help you land a job, let alone
“your dream job?

Members of the Panhellenic Council,
which governs Pitt's sororities, insist that go-
ing greek allows students to pump up their
resumes and gain leadership experience.

Panhellenic adviser Kara Petro is writing
her thesis on greek life and noted, "Extra-
curricular activities, greek [life] being one
of them, enhance the students’ sense of
belonging to the University, their leadership

internships average about $15 per hour, she said,
while liberal arts assignments can be considerably

But even without pay, the experience can prove
invaluable, and internships are increasingly popular.

set a good example," said Petro.
The members must delegate tasks, know

, who is attending and coordinate "all the lit-

tle logistics" of general event—planning, all

while doing their regular schoolwork.
Senior Lauren Cavalier said that she

knows the process well. Cavalier serves as

the alumni relations chair -for Alpha Delta

Pi sorority and interns at the_Pittsburgh
branch of the American Heart Associa-
tion. I

As an intern, Cavalier's responsibilities
include "assisting in the planning and ex-
ecution" of the Heart Ball and the Go Red
for Women reception — events that the heart
association hosts each year. Cavalier knew
the Gala director, Mary Catherine Houser,
becauseishe is the recruitment advisor for
Alpha Delta Pi. ‘

Being in a sorority "opens doorways," ,

said Cavalier.

She honed her interviewing skills when
she went through the recruitment process
and continued developing them after she

became a sister. Alpha Delta Pi',»like several
other sororities, holds both resume-"building
and interview workshops for its members.
And the sorority is "constantly contacted
by alumni." _

"Being greek is just a big networking
tool," said Cavalier. _ L

Phi Delta Theta fraternityalumnus Jor-
dan Pallitto agrees. During his time as a Phi
Delta Theta brother at Allegheny College,
he met former brother and current CEO
of the Hill Group, Chris Brussalis.

. A few years later he contacted Brussa-
lis and obtained an internship with the Hill
Group, a management—consulting firm in
Carnegie, Pa. Pallitto then went to graduate
school at CMU, where Brussalis is an ad-
junct professor of management and policy.
Last year the Hill Group hired Pallitto as a
full—time consultant.

"Greek life is an amazing thing," said
Pallitto.’ "I don't think there are any other
organizations on the planet with such en-
gaged alumni."

Unpaid internships pay

by Barbara Rose

C/.2_ica_go T rt"/Jruze (M CT Campzw )
CHICAGO (lV[CT Campus)—-— Thomas
Kemeny applied for an unpaid summer in-
ternship at a top-rated ad agency in Florida
after graduating from Columbia College in

2005. - —

The aspiring copywriter,'now the real _

deal at San Francisco’s Goodby Silverstein
& Partners, was thrilled then to work for
free. 1

‘‘There’s a little bit of a psychological
twist going where they [imply], ‘We’re so
good, we don’t have to pay,”’ he said. “You
think, if the law of supply and demand

works and they can_ pay me nothing, how‘

many people must want this job?”

Yet in plenty of talent—hungry industries,
the supply—and—demand principle works in
the intern’s favor. Big companies that hire
lots of young workers recruit as many as
75 percent of them through internships —
extended tryouts, really.

f‘It behoovesthem to pay their interns
because they don’t want to sour them on
the company,” said Edwin Koc of the Na-
tional Association of Colleges and Em-
ployers. , ._ ‘

Ninety-three percent of the,association’s
members offer paid internships, ‘and they
pay surprisingly well. The averageis $16.33
per hour for an undergrad, a rate that ap-
proaches the national $17.24 average for
hourly workers who'make up four-ﬁfths of
the workforce.

Employers not only are paying up for
good interns, they’re identifying future
ones at ever—younger ages — as_early as
freshman and sophomore years. ‘

“Dude, you have no idea,” she recalled

said, ‘I just calledyou dude, didn’t I?’ If I
was interviewing a senior and they did that,
I’d have_a hard time with it. But if they’re

a sophomore, I’m going to let the rope go
out pretty far.”

Competition is tough for such top—rated ‘

internships. In ﬁelds such as social service
and the arts, unpaid learning stints are still
the rule. Some colleges offer stipends so
istudentsican afford to take them.

Brigid Cakouros, a senior English writing

of nonverbal communication. At the very
least, you’ll become conscious of your
most frequent behaviors and have a chance
to avoid them during the actual interview.

You might also consider answering a
couple “interview—esque” questions for
your friends and family. People who have
known you for awhile will be able to tell
you if you answered their questions natu-
rally and whether you took the chance to
emphasize your best qualities.

Above all, have conﬁdence, because the
hardest part is already over.

“Many students don’t realize that when
they are sitting in that interview, they’ve’
made it past one of the hardest parts of the
process: the resume screen,” said ].P. Mary-
chak, the director of the Career and Lead-
ership Development ‘Center. “They need to
understand that the company already thinks
that they have potential.”

paid internship last summer at an invest-
ment advisory ﬁrm one hour’s drive from
his farnily’s Elmhurst, Ill, home. Then he
found a paying job at a building supply
store to keep his gas tank ﬁlled.

His project involved developing a mar-
keting plan that the ﬁrm funded. Two of
23 friends, acquaintances and family mem-
bers that he persuaded to come to a promo-
tional event signed up to be clients. It seems
the ﬁrm got the better deal, but McArthur
doesn’t view it that way.

The internship was “absolutely” valu-
able, he says. “Not only was it something I
learned from, I had something I could talk
about in interviews. It was also good prac-
tice for working decorum. It was the first
job I ever had where I went to work in a
tie.” ,

him chores nobody else wanted to do, such
as grabbing lunch for busy people, but he
managed to wrangle better assignments.

He got assigned to one project by stick-
ing around until midnight when people
wanted to go home and volunteering to
help. “They were like, ‘Give it a shot,”’ he
recalled.

Did he feel exploited? “Kind of, but I
think it wasmutual. I was using their name
[on my resume]. I think that it’s part of the
game.”

Elise Kidd, a University of Illinois grad-
uating senior, knocked herself out at paid
internships at two big employers over two
consecutive summers.

.“V(/hilc I had the opportunity to learn
and grow I really had to watch myself be-
cause it was like a threc—month interview al-
most,” shc said. “I had pressure to perform
the best I could do and to [outperform] the
other interns.”

For a project analyzing shift work, she
got up at 4 a.m. to arrive at a distribution
center to set up cameras by 6 a.m. The two-

What will he do with his earnings? After
taking care of expenses he plans to stash
