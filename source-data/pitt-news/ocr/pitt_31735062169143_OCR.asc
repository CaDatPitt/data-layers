Frick Plans Appeal
On Stephens Decision,
Claims Defamation

by DAN BOOKER

A Westmoreland County Judge has dismissed Helen
Clay Frick’s suit to stopdistribution of Sylvester Stephens’
book Pennsylvania—Birthplace of A Nation. Miss Frick’s
attorney, David Bueger, says, however, that “with all due
respect to Judge "Weidner, we think the decision is wrong
and will appeal it.”

Judge Clinton Weidner stated that everything in the book about
Henry Clay Frick, Miss Frick’s father, was true. Miss Frick con-
tended t'hat certain statements by Stephens about her father were
not true and would be defamatory to both her father, who died

in 1919, and to herself. Her suit. set the stage fora battle with
historians who believed the action to be a serious breach of aca-

demic freedom.

In his written statement, Weidner noted a long list of ﬁnd-
ings of fact ab-out the activities of coal and coke magnate Frick
that supported Stephens’ comments, Among these were the mono-
poly of coke production held by Frick and his successful attempts
to beat down efforts at unionization of his workers.

Attorney Buerger said‘ that there were “about 90 ‘findings of\_
fact that went our way.” “These were not pointed out in the Post-
Gazette article (published Fri-
day),” he added, “but we will
appeal on the ba-sis of about 25'

Buerger will ﬁle his appeal
today in a special two-judge

He explained that, because of
the “peculiarities of Pennsyl-

will include Judge Weidner and
another county judge. “We will

In an all-day meeting Friday, the Liberal Arts Cabinet (LAC)
and Dean James Kehl, dean of Liberal Arts, met to discuss a wide
range of topics concerning the conduct of students and faculty

Among the topics covered in four sessions we-re policies on
cheating, progress in th'e‘pass-fail program, development of a
course evaluation booklet, and the possib-ility of interdisciplinary

uly members. The proposal at-
tempted to provide common

and examination procedures.

Kehl emphasized that he pre-
fers “to call them guidelines,”
and not a deﬁnite statement of
policy. .

program to be instituted this:

fall, Dean Kehl stated that .be-
fore May 23, 69 students had
registered for pass-fail courses.
He was particularly pleased that
there was “no rush to one area
—-all disciplines were well rep-
resented.”

Spiegal ann-oun-ce-d at the
meeting that research for the
course evaluation booklet was
complete, but that problems
were developing in deciphering
all of the information. A booklet
to cover 80 and 180 courses,
“will be ready by -September,"
promised Spiegal.

Both Spiegal and Kehl made
remarks on proposed interde-
partmental programs. Such a
program would consist of a. list
-of courses constituvting -a major
not otherwise offered at -the Uni-

versity. The student wishing to ,

undertake an interdepartmental

major would have to submit his.

program for approval at the end
of his sophomore year to a spe-
cial committee. -

Kehl and the committee will
continue working on a state-
ment supporting the principle
of an interdepartmental pro-
gram, although deﬁnite plans
have not been made.

In other action, the cabinet
decided to send a memo to Dr.
C. Walter Stone of the Universi-
ty Library concerning hours for
the new library. S-piegal stated
that “basically, we want longer
hours.” He also noted -that Stone
had requested such a memo.

The committee also drafted -a
letter of welcome to Chancellor

Ulysses: History Maker

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ

Movie and censorship history
is being made by the Walter
Reade, Jr.-Joseph Strick ﬁlm
production of James Joyce’s lit-
erary masterpiece, Ulysses, now
showing at the Shadyside The-
ater. Since Judge Joseph M.
Woolsey’s 1933 verdict ruled
that Ulysses is not obscene,
there have been atileast three
attempt to make this modern
class into a ﬁlm.

Too many obstacles prevented
the completion of those at-
tempts: how Could a ﬁlm main-

- tain the essence of the book

without threatening the plot,
and the language; where would
it be ﬁlmed; who would act in
the ﬁlm; and if one did adhere
to the Joycean language how
would local and national censor
boards react to the ﬁlm.
Director Strick has solved most
of the forementioned problems.
In the ﬁrst place, Strick close-
ly followed the J oycean text. He
and his screenwriting associate
Fred Haines have created ﬁlmic
images which complement
J oyce’s language. It is quite ap-
parent to those who have read

,Ulysses (it is not essential to

read the book before seeing the
film, but it does help) that the
ﬁlm captures the spirit of J oyce’s
book; in fact, the ﬁlm can be
viewed as an outline guide to
the story. _ I
Ulysses is Homer’9 Odessey
in modern day terms. It des-
cribes one day (June 16, 1916)

‘in the lives of three people: Leo-

pold Bloom, a gentle, imagina-
tive Jew, who longs for his son,
Rudy, who died ten years be-
fore; Molly Bloom, Leopold's
vain, domineering wife who is
involved in an affair with her
concert promoter becuase she
has not been sexually satisﬁed
for ten years; and Stephen De-
dulus, a young poet-scholar
searching for something which
or someone who can help him
avoid the mundane life around
him, and find an outlet for intel-
lectual and literary pursuits.
Joyce describes the actions of
these individuals by use of the
omniscient narrator, and the in-
dividual though-t processes of the
characters. Joyce comes Very

close to artistically demonstrat-
ing the actual patterns of hu-
man thought.

Strick brings Joyce’s story
and style to the screen by use
of the following techniques: use
of dialogue, photographed ac-
tion, and narration by the ac-
tors of the thoughts which run
-through the minds of the char-
acters as -they perform various
tasks or deal with Various peo-
ple.

Excellent examples of these
methods are when Bloom re-
places his dead son with Steph-
en, while Stephen, ﬁnds Bloom to
be a fatherly companion who
has withstood the sordidness of
Dublin life and therefore stimu-
lates Stephen’s intellect, and
when Molly delivers her solilo-
quy at the end.

Strick’s cast brings J-'o~yce’«s
characters to life. The acting is
very natural and relaxed, add-
ing to the reality of the ﬁlm.
Milo O’Shea is superb as the
timid Leopold Bloom. O’S.he~a is
-excellent as he portrays the
transformation that Bloom goes
through because of the events
he experiences. Barbara J efford,
one of Englands leading Shakes-
pearean actresses, is perfect in
the d-ifficult role of Molly. Her
ﬁnal soliquy, the most uninhibit-
ed speech in all of the commer-
ci-al cinema, is performed beau-
tifully.

  

Maurice Roeve’s portrayal of
Stephen Dedulus and T. P. Mc-
l:enna’s performance as Buck
Mulligan, the lewd medical stu-
dent, are excellent. The other
members in the Ulysses ca-st, too
numerous to name here, ﬁt per-
fectly into Joyce’s characteriza-
tions.

The censors were the last ma-
jor -olbstacle that Strick had to.
overcome. In order to feel out
the censors Strick and Walter
Reade, Jr. planned a sshorrt (three (
day) showing of the ﬁlm. In"
most cases the ﬁlm Was not cut

’ or prevented from being shown.
The major complaint is that
Joyce’s lusty and bawdy lan-
guage can embarrass many peo-
ple. Whether it does or doesn’t
-em‘barras~s anyone is not the
point.

Poronography is in the mind
of the beholder. Director Strick
felt that the ﬁlm of Ulysses
shouid use the language of the
book. I'm glad he did. Joyce
knew people use bawdy lan-
guage. He felt that the use of
this language in Ulysses would
not make his work less artistic,

‘ if anything it would enhance it. 

Joyce’s -language, the way he
wrote it, good photography, and
superb acting make the ﬁlm
Ulysses not only a classic, but
also an {historical innovation into
the freedom from censorship for
the ants. ’

The Man For The Times

As we approach the end of Dr. David H. Kurtzman’s term as Chan-
cellorof our University, it is significant to illustrate the contrast in the
dismal outlook for our University at the time of Dr. Kurtzman’s‘ appoint-
ment as Vice-Chancellor for Finance two years ago and the positive pic-
ture that greets his departure from the chancellorship this Thursday.

‘ -When Dr. Kurtzman was named a vice-chancellor July 15, 1965, the
A University was in the midst of a severe financial crisis, $19.5 million in

_ , debt. The State Legislature had to loan the University money to meet its

payroll, and everyone was pondering the fate of our school, as Chancellor
Edward H. Litchfield stepped down from the helm.

Suddenly, there was talk of our becoming a state-related university,
and people were frightened that the ﬁnancial crisis had triggered the
downfall of our school as a quality institution. We would become associated
with the state and would now assume the status of a second—rate institu-

Iction, with all the visions for greatness vanishing in the harsh reality of
financing our institution. . .

Last summer we did become a state-related institution, but the pessi-
mistic -outlook espoused by critics of this move never came to pass. There
was no great exodus of outstanding faculty members or a lowering of ad-
mission standards. In fact, the rush of students to apply to our University
this past year has enabledthe highest standards ever to prevail.

During the course of Chancellor Kurtzman’s term, issues in other
areas flared up, as events occurred where he was forced t-o either take a
stand or remain silent. Dr. Kurtzman never faltered, whether he was called
upon to stand up to"Helen Clay Frick’s unreasonable demands or asked to

An Interview with the Chancellor

comment on the “conflict of interest” question regarding John C. Lang-
staff’s dual capacity as owner of Your Campus Store and director of Auxil-
iary Enterprises.

Our Chancellor stood ﬁrm n his opposition to Miss Frick’s dic-
tatorial desire to exercise control over her “gifts” to the University.
And when queried as to his stand on Langstaff’s ownership of Your
Campus Store, which has a more complete selection of items bearing the
University seal than contained in our own Book Center (for which Langstaff
is responsible), Dr. Kurtzman confessed that he had been heretofore una-
ware of Langstaff’s private business venture. He made this statement in
spite -of the fact that he was directly contradicting an official University
release proclaiming that Langstaff’s ownership was “well-known.” But
our Chancellor never was one to sooth egoes at the expense of conflicting
with his policy of honesty and directness.

Dr. Kurtzman’s term as Acting Chancellor and then Chancellor may
have been short in actual time, but his imprint on our University com-
munity has been. a lasting one. We are fortunate that hewill now be-
come Chancellor Emeritus and serve as our new "Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar’s senior adviser.

And as we welcome Dr. Posvar into the chancellorship, we must ex-
press our deep thanks to Chancellor David H. Kurtzman for his unflinch-
ing committment to the highest ideals. The exciting growth of our Uni-
versity and the rise in standards in so many areas are indeed the finest
tributes we could pay to him.

AS I reﬂect upon the transi-
tion that will occur this Thurs-
day when Chancellor David H.
Kurtzman will become Chancel-
lor Emeritus and Dr. Wesley W.
Posvar our new Chancellor, I

 cannot help but recall my initial

impression of another Chancel-
lor three years ago when I was
a freshman reporter. _

The then Chancellor Edward
H, Litchﬁeld was a man greatly
respected and feared. We would

7-‘%"-‘~2—never think of succeeding in ac-

tually contacting Dr. Litchﬁeld
to comment on any University
event. He was a man to be view-

‘, ' ed from afar. . .

I never had the opportunity
to meet the late Chancellor Stan-
ton Crawford, so I can only
judge him by the profound re-
spect he commanded from those
who knew him. But I have had

 the rare privilege of knowing

Dr. -Kurtzman, and, appraising
the honors I have been fortu-
nate enough to receive during
my career at this University, I
treasure my weekly meetings
with Chancellor Kurtzman above
all.

BECAUSE OF my deep ad-
miration for Dr. Kurtzman, it
wasnot without a few pangs of

_, ~, -sadness that I entered the ‘im-

pressive Office of t-he Chancel-

- I lor of the University last week
ff" to interview Dr. Kurtzm-an for
the last time as Chancellor.

When asked Why he had at-
tended every University func-
ti-on he could ﬁt into his demand-
ing schedule, unlike other ad-
m-inistrators with _far less re-
sponsibilities, the Chancellor re-
plied, ‘‘I think “a Chancellor

ought to become part of the
Universilty -community. If you
want students to feel part of
the University family, you can’t
stand aside; you ought to be a
participant.”
Dr. Kurztman felt that he per-

 A Culmination of a Career

by Linda Goldstein

sonally had gained a great deal
from his close rapport with stu-
dents: “I think I’ve learned a
lot from students. This is the
only way I have of knowing
what the student feeling is.
Many people think I have over-
extended myself, but it has been
rewarding.” The Chancellor
stressed that his efforts “have
been greatly appreciated by the
people who have participated
with me in these events. I wish
there could have been more par-
ticipation by other administra-
tors, too, but I do not want to
imposenmy feelings on them.”

ALONG WITH his attempts
to establish solid relationships
with "students, Dr. Kurtzman has
extended a hand in friendship
to the faculty. “Whenever I
don't have a meeting, I always
go up to the Faculty Club to
eat. When I ﬁrst went up as
Acting Chancellor, one of the
older faculty members said, ‘I
haven’t seen a Chancellor here
in ten years; as I said the other
day, you make us feel that you
are one of us.”’

The Chancellor's regard for
the faculty stem-s from the two-
and-a-half years he spent atthe
University of Pennsylvania as
senior research and educational
associate. “I did teaching pri-
marily, and it gave me a feel of
what a faculty person wants
from the administration. It has
been very helpful to me.”

Commenting on ‘his tenure at
the University, he remarked,
“My past two years at Pitt have
seemed to pass with lightning
speed. It seems that I came here
only yesterday. But it also seems
that my time at Pitt has been
an eternity—I feel that I’ve been
here forever. The past two years
h.ave been so packed with sur-
prise and challenge that they
seem to have passed in a twink-
ling, Yet they have been so sig-

niﬁcant to me that they seem to

-have constituted a much larger "

segment of my life.”

DR. KURTZMAN stressed that
‘‘it is as if the fast and lasting
friendships that have developed
in these two years had been nur-
tured and developed over» a life-
time.” He also wanted to “thank
my fr-iends———studen:ts, faculty,
admrinistration,
trustees. For the fact of the mat-
ter is, whatever success I may
have had here could not have
come without the support of all
these people.”

An honor which deeply touch-
ed the Chancellor occurred last
week at the AAUP-‘University
Senate dinner, when he was
presented with a bound volume
of letters from more than 200.
faculty members. “I will cher-
ish these for the rest of my life.
They are a richness that can

never be taken away from me,

“So it is with mixed feelings
that I quit the stage and return‘
to the wings,” the Chancellor
confessed. “It is a relief, of
sorts, because the burden of the
chancellorship is heavy. But it
is also a sadness, because the
experience has been so reward-
ing.”

Although it may be presump-
tuous on my part to correct my
Chancellor, I must point out

that he can never “return to the .

wings.” For a man of his cali-
bre is always in the limelight,
basking in the warm respect
and affection which he has so
thoroughly earned.

Entire Community Joins ,

In Praise of Kurtzman

Praise for Chancellor David
Kurtzman during his short but
signiﬁcant career here, has ema-
nated from many sources out-
side the University.

On the occasion of Dr. Kurtz-

man’s receiving anhonorary de- »
gree from his ahna mater, Tem- _

-ple University, the president of
the Temple ‘University Alumni

‘Association, Nathan C. Barr,

wrote to him, “’I‘-he conferring
of an honorary degree to“a per-
son of your stature particularly
pleases the Alumni Association
because you are being recog-
nized for the splendid job you
are doing.” , -
After the Erick controversy,
Gegore Swetnam of the Pitts-
burgh Press wrote, “. . . there’s
one person at the Press who

., t11'ir,1k§ you. deSe,.rve_a, big Oheer.
for standing up to Miss Frick.”

When Dr. Kurtzman was
named the University’s 14th
Chancel-lor, Richard K. Mellon
wrote to him, “Of course, you
have worked so hard and han-
dled everything so beautifully
that you more than deserve it,
but I just wanted you to have
my best wishes for your con-
tinued interest in matters per-
-taining to the University and

' tell you how plea-sed I am that

the Trustees took this action.”

The Valley Daily News of Ta-
-rentum, Pa., wrote, “During a
brief time he solved some of the
most perplexing and serious ﬁ-
nancial problems the institution
has ever faced.”

The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette
editorialized, “Thanks in large
measure, however, to the effi-
cient manner in which Acting
Chancellor David Kurtzman has
brought his wide experience and
economic expertise to bear upon
the University’s affairs, Pitt is
back on the track and once more
solvent. So long as Dr. Kurtz-
man is on the job, there is rea-
sonable expectation of maintain-
ing that blessed condition. Pitt is
most fortunate to have him.”

In an editorial, entitled “Bou-

' . quets for Dr. David Kurtzman,”

station WIIC said, “Fortunately
IOI‘ the University and for Pitts-
burgh, the future seems bright.
Bu-t we believe without Dr. Da-
v-id Kurtzman, the outlook might
not have been as promising. We,,
at WIIC-TV, feel that the entire
community owes a deep grati-
tude to Dr, Kurzman and it
-seems quite obvious that Pitt
will long enjoy the beneﬁts of.
his devotion, ﬁscal genius and/
hard work. Happily, Dr. Kurtz-
man‘ will become the Chancel-
lor Emeritus and Senior Adviser
to Dr. Posvar. Thusthe Univer-
.s_ity~and its new leader will have
the fbeneﬁts of‘ Dr. Kurtzman’s

‘- ability for some years to come.’’

In at ;1ef,te.Ij

Me-llon Bank, wrote, “I do wish
to express my pleasure and hap-
piness at your being elected
Chancellor of the University . . .
I certainly hope th-at after June
1 you will not cease to be ac-
tive in the University affairs on
something more deﬁnitive than
a consulting basis.”

William J. Lederer, member of
the Pennsylvania House of Rep-
resentatives, wrote, “Your lead-
ership was very helpful in per-
suading the General Assembly
last year to resolve the great
ﬁscal problems of the Universi-
ty. We were fortunate in having
you lead the way.”

Upon his selection as Oakland
Man of the Year, Dr. Kurtzman
received congratualtions from
Michael Baker, Jr., president of

an engineering ﬁrm: “This is a”

-deserved honor. -. - . Undoubted-

‘ly you have rendered a great

service to the University and to
the City -of Pittsburgh and to
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
Vania.”

Faculty Members Express

Gratitude In Bound Volume

Last Tuesday, Chancellor Da-
vid H. Kurtzman was presented
with a bound volume of more
than 200 letters from" faculty
"members. The following ex-
cerpts represent the thoughts
expressed by the faculty:

. Dr. George Fahey, president,
University Senate: “How does
-one express his admiration and
-say thank you to someone who,
in a brief time:

> “Turned a multimillion dol-
l-ar catastrophy into a positive
m-odel for the public support of
higher education?

‘:> “Held together a thousand
disenchanted college professors
and recommitted them to the
enterprise?

> “Turn-ed the tarnished pub-
11c image of an institution into
a foundation for growth?

't> “Did these things and much
more armed with only courage,
integrity, and conﬁdence and
without posturing, threatening,
caj oling, or vacuous promising?”

Dr Reuben E. Slesinger, asso-
ciate dean and professor of eco-
nomics: As a member of the fac-
ulty for over 30 years, I have
experienced service under a
number of chancellor-s. Yours
has been the most organized,
efficient, and meaningful of all.
You served well when morale
was low, raised it to its highest
levels, and have set high stan-
dards.-for its future.’’.

E. I. Salkovitz, chairman, Met-
allurgical and Materials, Engi-
neering: “If I may, I would like
to quote a comment recently
made to me by a Pitt alumnus

in Philadelphia. He said that

_America semed to be develop-

ing two types of leaders, either
the ‘doers’ or the ‘explainers.
Dr. Kurtzman,’ he said, ‘is one

of the rare breed who does  '

He is a .doer and-then takes the
time to explain what, how, and
why in a very direct manner
to all parties involved.’ This
candid appraisal is shared by
an‘)!

Jerome L. Rosenberg, profes-
sor of chemistry: “Pirke Avort
contains the pithy comment,
‘Who is honored? He who hon-
ors others.’ One of your traits
that has endeared you to the
faculty ha-s been the demonstra-
tion of respect that you have
shown us and the frankness
with which you have discussed
with us our common problems
and aspirations. For showin-g us
this consideration we hold you
in the highest honor. The same
Mishne -raises and answers an-
other question: ‘Who is rich?
He who rejoices in his portion.’
The zest with which you have
approached the most challeng-
i-ng problem and the ﬂair with
which you have effected their
solurtion are evidence that you
are a wealthy man indeed. We
are thankful that you have
-shared and will continue‘ for
many years to share this wesalith
with us.” '

Jack.Mathews, chairman, De-
partment of Speech and The-
atre Arts: “Your contribution
to me personally has been in
helping me maintain commit-
ments to values learned from

my parents—values I want for

my children. These values -are ~ 

sometimes shaken when I ob-

serve ‘successful’ men swbstiturte

Dr. Robert P. Newman, pro-

fessor of speech and former did-, ~,.;,:,_,;
rector of the_  {Pitt Deo - ’ "j

pressed in the Debating Union,

From Sabre Point To Chancellor

Kurtzman’s Life One of Struggle and Success

Part of Chancellor David H. Kurtzman’s

story will sound familiar to anyone who

has heard the harrowing tales of immi-
grants who fled to America to escape per-
secution. It is the later part of his story
which makes the early part stand out in
bold relief. What happened to him after
his arrival in the United States in 1921
sharply contrasts with What happened to
so many immigrants, who, after spectacu-
lar and super-human struggles to get to
these shores, settled into quite ordinary
existances.

Dr. Kurtzman was born in Russia in
1904, the son of a successful Jewish whole-
sale grocer. They lived in a small town
near Odessa and when _he was 11 years
old, he was enrolled in the Gymnasium in
Odessa. Those were, in contrast to_the fol-
lowing few years, the “good days” al-

, though, even then, only ten per cent of

school students could be Jewish, and our

- Chancellor had to be squeezed into that

quota. .

The Russian Revolution brought terror-
ists into the streets. Once Dr. Kurtzman
was held at the point of a sword and was
rescued in the split second timing that has
come to characterize a melodrama or a B
movie. “A good Christian, posing as a sol-
d»icr—a man who was simply sick of all of
-the killing—rushed in and cried “Stop.” "The
terrorists, thinking the man had authority,
obeyed.

The ﬂight from Russia was like many
.such ﬂights—soundless and ﬁlled with ter-
ror. Dr. Kurtzman and his family stayed
in Rumania. (his father had earlier died
in a typhus epidemic) until they establish-
ed citizenship and obtained a visa. Then
he, one— sister, 7 and -her husband left for

- Belgium, London,and, ﬁnally the long ocean

so it was there that our Chancellor, at 17,
speaking fbroken English, went to work to
help bring some of the others across. For
two years he was a factory hand, worked
in a. laundry, and‘ even did a trick as a. the-
ater usher.

At 19, after helping. buy passage for
s-ome of the others, he enrolled in North-
east High School and graduated in a year
and a h'alf—«a record for the school. Im-
pressed with his brightness, the principal
helped steer him toward a "scholarship at
Temple where he majored in accounting
but developed a taste for Political science-

 

nn. DAVID II. Kurtzmanat 21 as a student-

at Temple University.

His political science teacher insisted that
he work for an advanced degree but David
Kurtzman wavered. “After all ,I was mar-
ried now, and I thought it was time I earn-
ed a living.” His wife, Celia, however, urged
him to go after the Ph.D. so he enrolled
for advanced study at the University of
Pennsylvania. -

America was in the depth of the de-
pression and things were far from easy.
The Ph.D. candidate got a teaching post
at Temple and took, on a second job, that

day I’d t-ake a train to and from Chester,

-get a subway to Temple to teach a course ~

and get another subway to Penn to take

a course.” He got two hours of sleep a '

night and thrived on it.

The Chester job earned him a reputa-
tion which was underlined by his startling
and perceptive thesis: “Methods of’Control-
ling Votes in Philadelp ’ ” The ﬂedglng *
Pennsylvania. Economy League was wait-
ing in the Wings on graduation day. With
the league, Dr. Kurtzman became one of
the main architects of the Pittsburgh ren-
aissance. And it was during his time with
the -league that he suggested the creation
of a. new state cabinet post—that of secre-
tary'o_f administration, a clearing house for
the state government. It was not a post
he had any intention of ﬁning, but under
the persistent urging of the late David L.
Lawrence, he ﬁnally accepted. One of his
biggest accomplishments in the post was the
virtual elimination of the Commonwealth's

deﬁcit. When the Lawrence term ended, he ”

became senior research and educational as-
sociate at Fels Institute of Local and State
Government at the University of Pennsyl-
vania and it was in that job that he re-
ceived a. telephone call, one day in 1965 from
his formerboss, Governor Lawrence. Law-
rence told him the University of Pitts-
burgh was in trouble and needed him.
Would he accept a. post as vice chancellor
for ﬁnance?

His apopintment as acting chancellor
came six months later after the sudden
death of Chancellor Stanton C. Crawford.
And, as Chancellor Emeritus less than half‘
a century  have passed since David
Harold Kurtzman stood numb with fear be-
fore a Russian terrorists sword. " .

Rally Late, Upend  

Dukes 3-2 In Season Finale

by MIKE BROURMAN

Bobby Lewis gambled on
seniority in Saturday’s base-
ball game with Duquesne,
and the gamble almost back-
fired. It took a couple of jun-
iors to hold off the Dukes until
the seniors could rally to score
a 3-2 victory in ten innings.

Lewis started senior right-
hander Don Stock on the
mound, and Duquesne battered
him for six hits and two runs
in two innings. “Don just didn’t
have it today,” Lewis noted aft-
er the game.

Junior southpaw Dave Welty

.relieved Stock in the third and

shut out Duquesne the rest of
the way. In eight innings Welty
allowed only one hit" and three

walks while striking out ten -

batters. No Duquesne player
reached third base.

But, while Welty was hand-
cuffing Duquesne, the ‘Dukes’
ace, Jim Oldenburg, pitched out
of trouble, inning after inning.

“We have all kinds of batting
averages and no runs batted in,”
moaned Lewis. “We haven’t hit
with men on base all year.”

Thus, by the bottom of the
ninth, the score still stood 2-0
in favor of Duquesne. It was
here that the Panthers" erupted
in a rally very similar to the
one with which they ‘defeated

Bailed out by teammates.

Clarion at Forbes Field two
weeks ago.

In that game, the mitters
scored two runs with two out
in the ninth to eke out a 6-5 win.
The winning run scored on a
wild throw from the outfield.

Events Saturday were" very
similar. Chris Mitchell opened
the ninth with a line single past
the second baseman, and Lewis
sent in Floyd’ Snyder to run for
him. But with two outs, Snyder
was still at first.

Then captain Tom Beckett_

walked, leaving it‘ up to junior
George McKenzie. Earlier in the
game, McKenzie had fanned
with the bases loaded. Olden-
burg quickly got him in--the
hole with two quick strikes.
Then George fouled off seven
pitches.

On the next pitch he bounced
a. single between first and sec-
ond. Snyder. scored on the play
and when the right fielder
threw the ball away, Beckett
tallied the tying run.

That set the stage for the
tenth inning. Steve Kienzl drew
a walk off relief pitcher Mike
Creighton. After Kienzl was
sacrificed to second, Phil Nas-
rallah drove a pitch all the way
to the fence in left center for
double, to Kienzl with the win-
ning run.

In explaining his game win-
ning hit, Nasrallah, who is of
Arabic descent, dryly comment-
ed that “Nasser called me on
the phone last night and told me
not to let Sammy‘ bat. (He was
referring, to the on-deck hitter
‘Sam Glass who is Jewish). So,
1 had to. win it myself.”

It was a fittingend for the
four senior regulars, Mitchell,
Beckett, Kienzl and Nasrallah,
in that each had a part in the
late rally which brought the
Panthers their 13th win against
three defeats.

Coach Peery Says:

Golfers’ Season Pleasant Surprise

“It’s going to‘ be a long’
season,” commented golf
coach Rex Peery at the be-
ginning of the year. As it
turned out however, the sea-

son wasn’t quite long enough ,

for the golfers. _

With the top two players gone
from last year's team_that post-
ed a 3-14 rec0rd,_Peery had rea-
son to be pessimistic. However,
the golfers surprised their
coach by finishing with a 6-8
mark, and a pair of cancella-
tions possibly kept them from
breaking even.

-Bucknell and Clarion both
failed to show for their sched-
uled matches. Had the golfers
won those two, they would have
finished at .500,

Neverth-eless,, Peery is W ell

pleased with the season. “They

back to score a 3 and 1 victory.

“It would have been some.

speculated Peery.

even better things next year,

Pope. “Penn State is in aleague‘

Bill Nichols, who was un-

animously voted mos.t valuable
player by the players, went down
to defeat at the hands of State’s
ﬁrst singles player Mario Obvan-

“Bill kept getting the ball back _

to Obando, but he could never
get on the offensive,” said Pope.
Obando is ranked number seven

Cap-tain Bob Salembier did not
play in the match because of
an upcoming operation. His
place was taken by junior Dick
Chalfant. .-

This was the ﬁrst match play-
ed by Chalfant this season. Ac-
cording to Pope, “Dick is a pol-

He just needs plenty of prac-
tice to sharpen his game and
concentration.” Chalfant had
come out for the team in the

The IC4A’s two day cham-
pionships at Villanova Uni-
versity was just a one night
stand for tracksters Roger Hol-
ly and Wayne Bodenheimer. Nei-
ther qualiﬁed for Saturday’s ﬁ-
nals.

Holly turned in “a real good
job, as he’s done all year,” point-
ed out head coach Jim Banner,
but he didn’t make the cutoff
time of 1.51.9 for -the half mile.
Holly’s time in the trials, as all
other non-qualifying times, was
not disclosed by meet officials.

Meanwhile Bodenheimer, who
had thrown 223 feet i-n practice,
again came across his old ne-
misis, pressure. “He just has to
learn to relax,” remarked Ban-
ner. —

Wayne Donelon of Maryland
led Friday’s qualifying trials
with a— throw of 239 feet, two
and a half inches. Bodenheimer’s
best throw in any type of com- 5
petition this season is 209 feet,
eight inches, a toss which led
all entrants at the Bowling
Green Relays over a month ago.
The IC4A cutoff came at 210
feet.

For the team title, host Vil-
lanova scored in 11 events and
dethroned two year leader Mary-
land, 37-21. A surprising Rut-
gers’ team ﬁnished third with
20 points, then followed Army
with 19; Yale, 15; Georgetown,
14; and Navy and Penn State
tied for eighth With 13. _

For Holly, despite missing the
ﬁnals, the chance to run in the
«Eastern champions-‘hips con-
cluded his ﬁn-est track year.

cross country by Banner last
fall, Holly strengthened his legs.
His composure on the track
changed, too. He ran in more
different events. Only a junior
he’ll return next year.

For Banner, the trip actually
proved no loss. Since his tracks
men missed out, he still used
his time wisely.

Banner, Holly, and Bodhen-V

heimer went to University Park
where the high SChl0O]. State
Track and Field Championships
were held. And they didn’t go
just to watch. They were re-
cru-iting.

Banner, a sly but serious re-
cruiter, never publicizes who he
is getting. But one thing is for
sure, he is getting them. Yet he
doesn’t boast, nor does he prom-
ise. .

“To balance out the program
here, it will take a good two
years,” Banner said. “This year
I’ve tried to concentrate on
evrything, track and ﬁeld men.

“But I have ‘put more em-
puhasis on dist-ancemen,” he con-
tinued.

At the State championships,
which were dominated by dis-
trict athletes, who established
ﬁve new records, Banner did do
some watching.

He saw Jerry Richey, who was
Bann~er’s ﬁrst recruit, set a new
mark in the mile run and also
