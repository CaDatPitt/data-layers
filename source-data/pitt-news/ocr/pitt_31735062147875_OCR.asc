deliberation -on theIVpa1t’t of the judges.

The question was, “Resolved, That—
It Should Be the Policy of the United
States to? Claim Full Payment of the
Debts Owed I-Ier By the Allied Na-.
tions.” The affirmative was Ipro-I
pounded by Pitt; the negative by Col-
gate. Pitt was represented by John
D. S. ,Truxa;l,1, E. J. Levy, and Chaun-
cey E. Pruger. ‘Colga.te’s debaters
were: William F. Davison, Abram C.
Brokaw I and Hermon S. Pinkham.
Chance-llor J. G. Bowman was the
presiding oificer. The judges Were’:
Professor W. J. Kay, of West Vir-
ginia University; Alexander Dumber,

vice-president and cashier of the"

Bank of Pittsburgh, N. A. and ‘Wal-
ter S. Lobineier, Editor of the Pitts-
burgh Legal Journal. .
The program consisted of four
parts; ﬁrstt speeches, intermission,
rebuttal speeches, and judges’ decis-
ion. I/‘ I ’
Truxall opened the debate with a.
summary of_ what he termed favor-
able economic conditions of Ehrope.
He advocated payment of -the debts
by securities and goods. ‘ ' ,
Davison, who opened for the nega-
tive, gave one the impression that
his home must have been in “Caro-
liny” or “Alabamy,” for he possessed
much of the Southern drawl. His
statement that the policy of the
United States has been that of vir-
tual cancellation was later violently
attacked by the affirmative.
Levy, the most serious ‘of the de-
baters, and perhaps unconsciously
the. most humorous, accelerated the

ing to the audience .I on the ground

Pruger dealt more withthe moral

istjof -‘nations, cancelled -all dbbts ‘in-
curred’ by the allied nations in the
.conduct -of the war. He stated that
the world is ; an economic unit, and
that a disturbance in one portion of
it creates :a disturbance in all other
parts. Pinkham was clearly the most
impressive and expressive of the de-
baters. ‘ _ '

The rebuttals were opened by Dav-
ison, of the negative. He was fol-
lowed‘ by '.l‘ruxal€l,, who rebutted par-
Brokaw rebutted with
greater vigor and vividness than he
used in his first presentation.

Levy replied with concrete state-
ments to questions put by the nega-
tive, and questioned for the author-
of statements made -by the negative.
Levy described the position of the
United States at Versailles’ as “easy
picking, that’s’"°‘ wha.t!”I Levy was
generously applauded.

Pinkham,  his characteristic
concreteness,I presented his rebuttal
with 9. style that commanded minute
attention, and admiration. He re-
ceived the greatest applause of the
evening- , Q ' I

Are You, PittliAl umnus, }Going   to
, the Band Concert Next Wednes-
day Night, Aprili5th?l

If you had not thought of doing so, read the following
letter from Dr. R. B. Armstrong, Med. ’10. Dr. Armstrong,
while located in Ida Grove, Iowa, is “doing his bit” to put the
Band Concert over.
ing two tickets for,a relative in Pittsburgh who is a. prospect-
for Pitt. The letter follows: 1 ‘ . 
“Enclosed glease find my check for $2 and Band Concert blank for

two tickets to concert April ‘5. Please mail them to Lfeinnox Gordon, 1301
Arch Street, N’. S-., Pittsburgh, a nephew, who is now in high school,

-- and a prospective Pitt student of -the future.

,"The;Pitt Bandsurely deserves the support of us all.”-

The Pitt Band is one of the grandest. institutions that we
have, It is an advertising-.medium.that always attracts atten-
tion. The alumni likejto. hear the boys play at the football

games. Those who have been on the football trips always feel
themselves swell up with pride when the band marches out
on the ﬁeld. , ‘ ‘ ‘  9 gs

Pitt men are glad to boast that THEIR BAND is just as .

good as any band of opposing’ teams, and, in many cases, a lot
better. At all the annual ga.mes~~ with -Penn at Philadelphia,
the Pitt. Band makes a big hit, and is on an equal basis with
the crack band‘ of the University of Pennsylvania, which has
been in existence for many years. I , 1 9 n
This is the last chance ,we. get to -boost the band to the
alumni. Your best answer  be to ﬁll out the blank and
rush it into the manager at No. 1 State Hall. The boys have 0
been working steadily for the last month or so preparing for
this concert and have many surprises in store. They will play
all the better if greeted” by a crowded house at Carnegie Hall
next Wednesday. Will you support them? 1 _ C _

. ' Of Home-Shoe Type. pp

The stadium is the shape of a
horseshoe with two towers] at the
closed end, connected by a. '70-foot
arch and half-dome forming the main-
entrance feature, while at the ends of
the legs will be towers in which will
be housed the athletic offices, team,
locker and shower rooms.

The construction is of --reinforced
concrete and structural steel, requir-
ing about 4,300 tons structural tee1,,
28,000 cubic yards of concrete, and
about 1,000 tons of reiniorcing steel.

In so shortanjarticle it is impos-
sible to adequately describe‘ so im-

i posing a structure as this, which we

hope will represent the most modern
ideals from both the architectural and
engineering stand-points and will be a
credit to both professions, which un-
fortunately cannot be said of most
structures oi this type now in exist-
ence. I g V .

  SENIIIR

  
    

(By Minnie Z. Buckley, '15.)

Word comes that Gretchen Buske,
Puritan of the class or 1915, is
dancing and “bridging” ‘these days.
Probably true, too, for the ‘spirit
of the West, sure gets into the bones
after a few months’ residence. But

it .happens to be known also that

she is doing more than that, for
she is the chief pusher for the
’Ilenth Anndvprsary soelebration of
the Pittsburgh Central High School
‘Class or 1912, to be held ’ on the
Chatham root on Tuesday evening,
April 25. Nothing in anticipation
need be said of the program when
it has been announced that it is
;being arranged by Louis - Broido,
Law, ’17. Aside from the many men
who came to Pitt, that class of

1912, P. ‘C. lFr'.,tS., contributed about

ﬁfteen girls to the University: Cath-
erine Dunn Middleton, Clare Mc-
Gonnelll O’=H‘.aga.n, Bass ‘Moslwigan,
Edith London Slusky, ‘Beatrice Mc-
Millan, Katherine Shepard, Emily
Bowman, Anna Sack, Mary Jones
Grove, Jean Foight, Gretchen Buske

and Minnie Buckley.

.“THE IDEAL TYPE -OF-STUDEN'l"’.

Now that all eyes are turned upon
the new act of ‘choosing an ideal stu-
dent which will be the type of a man
or woman the University of Pitts-
burgh will strive to produce. I think
it is ﬁtting and proper at this time
to take inventory and examine the
different types which -we have ‘in
school today. In all probabilities the
student will have to be a sort of
homogeneous mixture of the different
qualities now represented at the Uni-
versity. ' 1 v

The student whoyshould be chosen
by the committee of thirty members
from the different classes of the de-
partments is one who should be a
good student. By this I do not mean

he should be an “A” student or neces-- A

sarily ,a “B” studentbut one who is
good in his work. The person‘chos_en-
should be a careful and conscientious
worker in everything he would do.
He should be the one who strives to
get the most accurate work done in
the allotted time‘-for» the task. The
man or woman who  honored by be-
ing awarded the prize of $100 is the

. one who s-hould be willing to work

beyond ptheclose of the period. As

is known the man who ‘does not keep

his eyeon the-clock at the office or
factory is the one who eventually gets
the promotions.‘ So it should be in
the case of choosing the ideal student
attending the University of Pittsburgh
during‘ this losemester. Another char-

acteristic ‘ of the student chosen ‘to

represent this institution of learning
is his athletic development. '

The man orwoman who is thought
to be the ‘type of student -that the
school should endeavor to turnout is
the one who is well developed phy-
sically. We do not want fa ,«’person
to ‘represent our Alma Mater who is
sickly and always has the expression
on his face that he ‘has one foot in
the grave and the other out of -it as
the saying goes. It is the robust girl
and fellow we want to have represent
as in the world. I would advise every-
one who aspires to the honor of being
this ideal student to go around the
campus as ‘if he’were alive- The
world today needs men and women
who are strong enough to {stand the
strain of the rush of the modern com-
mercial world. ‘The student need not
be a football L star nor a basketball
star but he should have a good recom-
mendation from the head. of the Phy-
sical Department to the effect that
he was always willing to take part in
the different games’ in the gymnasium
and that he was ready to accept a
challenge to perform some daring
feat in the presence of his classmates.
The same qualiﬁcaltions holds also
for.-the girls. It is the object of the
University to turn out a real all
around man so his social life must
not be neglected while he is a stu-
dent.

It is extremely necessary for a per-’

emacle aa

1 for Iegraduatloui and a. course begun

‘under the supervision. of a. member
of the faculty to instruct those who
cannot dance. Why is it necessary
that the ideal student should learn
to dance? Well, because the Univers-
ity holds several dances each year for
the students and secondly most of the
classes do also. In order to become
a well. ﬁnished product of the ‘ Uni-
versity the person must be well ac-
quainted with theother students and
this is best accomplished by attend-
ing tllle many social lfunctions held
during the year. At these functions
dancing is always a part of the pro-
gram even the aftermath of basket-
ball games’ now. «

. Of course, I realize that there is a
certain limit to this latter subject of
society. It should not be overdone
but it is up to the activity commit-
tee to look after that and. Talking
about the Committee on Student Ac-
tivities brings about the ‘subject of
how many clubs, and organizations
should our desired student he allowed
to enter. , or

I believe now the ruling stands that
a student must have a certain grade
to join more than one organization.
I think that this pupil should belong
to at least one activity in his school
career. There are several good’ clubs
a fellow should join according =td“A his
likes. They develop the different tal-
ents one has. It may be dramatic
ability or musical ability. A The ideal
student should belong to a‘.-5‘ many as
he can and still maintain a general
averagegof “C” orabove. ‘A few of
the miscellaneous characteristics’ our
type of Ideal student should possess
are scattered throughfthe items of ap-
pearance”inoluding his manner of
dressing. "A man or woman attends-
ing a . University shogjld be careful
how he dresses. It sort -of reflects
upon your school if you don’t dress
neatly. ‘Another item is reli.g'.ion., It’
is not sectarian. Tlhe religion of L a.
man is how he lives everyday. The
ideal student however should‘ affiliate
himself with some deﬁnite religious
organization because through this

outgrowth or branch of religion is
the art of conducting ones’ self well
in society.  ‘O ,
Now to sum up my opinion‘ I can
condense this article by saying fthat
our Ideal student should ‘be at good
student in good health and an ardent
supporter of all a-ctivizties going on.
in school, social, dramatic, and ath-
letic. He or she need not belong to
a fraternity, but should give -them
support when they ask for it. .
Another decision necessary is What
class s-houldgthe student belong. The
most logical class would be the Senior.
I take this stand because the student
would have shown his qualiﬁcations
and it would '-be fairly easy to pro-‘
phecy that he would make -a success
of life, (so many of -the honor stu-
dents do not) and his record in the
University would. be complete. .
Now dear friends, that is my opin-
ion as to what the Ideal student should
be. At the present writing, however,
I can ‘think of no one in -the Uni-
versity worthy of the George W. Pep-

the judges "will have to be based upon
a_ narrower set of qualiﬁcations.
. Ambition.

are getting ready to resume their

lion or so steps to Alumni Hall. At
last I’-m in the building. My thoughts
are drowned in the roar, the chatter,
.and the laughter of the groups, and
crowds about me. Ten feet from the

“There will, be an eclipse of the sun ,

tomorrow, March 28th, but not visible
in the United States.
the eclipse passed over Brazil and
Northern Africa. It is what is known
as an annular eclipse, where the moon
does not completely cover the sun,
and for this reason is of no particular,

«interest to astronomers.

The total eclipse‘ which comes on
September 20th, of this year, visible
over the Indian‘ Ocean and Atlstralia,
is, however, a very important eclipse

from the astronomer’s standpoint, and‘ I

a number of expedition; will soon
start to observe it; most of these ex-

peditions will make further tests of
relativity by seeing ;

the theory of
whetherthe rays of light from dis-
tant stars are bent or deflected as
they pass the eclipsed sun. Several
European expeditions are planned and
two. go from America; parties from

the Lick Observatory and from the 1

University of Toronto will establish sta-
tions at Wollal, alittle telegraph sta-
tion which is about the middle of the
Ninety-Mile Beach on the desolate
and uninhabited northwest coast of

‘Australia. The Allegheny‘ Observa-

tory will not~:be, represented at‘ this

eclipse, except that it is loaning a

. L BYERS’L,LELECTlON POPULAR L

The election of “Red” Byers to the ‘basket ball captaincy for next year
is a popular one. LT The cc-nccnsus of opinion is that “Red” was the logical
man for the job and very much deserving of the honor. Not only is “Red”
a star of the first magnitude on the floor but he has the natural qualifica-
tions of leadership. For Tthelpast two seasons “ReLd" has been one of the
most dependable and one of the most brilliant players on the squad, and.
that, in spite of the fact that his Freshman year he was not a member of
the regular Freshman team. But more than being a good player, “Red” is
ca ﬁghting player and his'Tfight and ability to instil hisﬁghting spirit into
the rest of them should make him a great leader next year. L

L LL BALL PLAYERS SIGN PLEDGE
A novel means for keeping the members of the baseball squad in train-
ing is being employed this year by Coach Harley. ltis not a new idea for
it is in use at anumber of other universities, but this is the first time in
our recollection‘ of its having been put in use at Pittjin any brancli of sport.
Each Lmember of the squad this year is required to sign =thLis pledge:

and conscientiously during the college baseball season.” It has" always been
a more or less deﬁnitely understood training rule that the players abstain
from smoking during the season, but in all college circles andin most
branches of sporttherq, seems tovbe, a growing laxity in the enforcement of
thisrule, in spite of the fact that it is based onjust as‘ sound principles
of health and the care of our bodies as it ever was. Coach Harley, having
had a lot of baseball experience, is undoubtedly a ﬁrm believer that a bail
player‘ cannot be at his best when he is using nicotine, and has taken this
me‘.-and as ‘one of the surest ways of seeing that the fellows stickLto training

Freshmen baseball,
answered the call last eek and are
working orut daily at the indoor
track unde-r the coaching of “CLhalky”

ball luminary. The Lwork has been
.g1I-eaitly hindered due to “the in-

liamson hopes to 'get,his men out
on Trees Field this week, which has
been put in excellent shape by

Ollie DeVi-ctor. The‘ Freshmen will.

meet the Varsity in several practice
games before starting their regular
schedule, now in the course of
preparation by Freshman Manager S.
G. Wertz. The first scheduled game
will LtLa‘Lke place in three weeks.
Much interest is being shown by
the ﬁrst year men in their work,
approximately ﬁfty men having
signed up to try out for places on
the team. Lisiweto-nic, fo_rmLer star
pitcher at TA11e-gheny High, is show-
ing up in line form. and expects to
have a. banner year on the mound.
Fawcett, formerly of Sch-enley High,
where ‘he made: quite a. reputation
for himself, is=-"trying outfor airin-
ﬁeld position. Bruder, of football
fame, is also working [out daily Land

 baseball squad is now on» its
second. week of spring training.’ How-

been -accomplished thus liar due to the
unfavorable condition of tthe weather.
Although the diamond stars have been
unable to indulge. in outdoor practice,
they‘ have -been using the indoor track
regularly for the preliminary exer-
cises. It is hoped however. that the
squad‘ will soon be out-of-doors.
Trainer -L Ollie DeVictor has been
working on the diamond’ for some
time, and w‘i11L'soon have it ready for
use. Much is dependent upon the
early training this season. ' The Pan-

some of “ the sLou~t.'ll‘ern college teams

Coach Harley has had an opportu-

quiteconﬁdenit that Pitt will be repre-
sented by Larﬁrst class team this sea-

without the services
Townsend, LS-Lapper and Laughiran, the

T -squad as a whole gives promise for

a successful. season. - Each depart-
ment of the team appears to be well
fortiﬁed. L T - ’

It is as yet far to earlyito give
any idea how the team will line up
in the initial encounter-.L Up to date
however it appears that the receiv-
ing end will be taken care of by the
"two. grladuartes from‘ the freshmen
ranks, Gables and Parker. These men
did the catchlin-g work  in splendid
fashion for the yearlingisli of last year,
The ﬁring line will be ably taken care
of by .LCurry, Hill, ‘Carr, Bloom” and
Noble: The first three a men who
llave come up from the fl-es men team
and are expected to {ill the grape left
-by ‘Townsend and Barrett. The lat-
ter two were members of .-the varsity
squad last year. Much is ‘expected of
“S-trin-g” Noble 1:hisyLear._ Hewas
one -of the standbys last‘ -season and
fromsthe form displayed thus far..ap-

pears to be developing into the "iron

man” for the Panthers. ‘ L

C It is likely LCl!awson will return to
his old position on the initial sack.
Davies may be ‘seen again in the short
ﬁeld, although it is likely that he will
be converted into an outﬁelder. Coop-
er (is the leading candid-ate for the.
third-sack position. The second base
poLsitlion is somewhat up in the air
due to LauLLg'hran’s decision to devote
his time to track Work, although Tom
Holleran will probably "be brought in
from the outfield. The outﬁeld prom-
ises to contain the stellar trio, Capt.
Cook, Barberand Davies or Holleran.
In addition th e are many likely can-
didates who were members of last
year’s freshman team who are going
to make the veterans hustle for their
positions. Cresswell, Heasley, and
Jordan are making determined bids
for positions on -the team. It is not
likely that any position will be cinch-
ed throughout the season.

The schedule fa-cin the Panthers is
one of most. impressive and attractive
schedules that has ever been arranged
for a Pantherjnine. The season is to
be opened by a trip that has been
unprecedented in Pitt athletic {his-
tory, when the Panthers meet six
southern college teams during the
Easter recess. On Monday, April 10,
V. P. I. will be met at Blacksburg,

The most‘. important event of the
big banquet given the basketball team

last week was the election of “Red”

Byers as captain of the Piltt basket-
ball team for the season 1922-23. The
election of Bye1~s,faltholrgh coming as
no surprise, ibrou-ght forth a big cheer
from everyone present.

Byers is recognized as one of the
best roving guards in collegiate cir-
cles, he being chosen on most of the
all-star team-s. As a shot and speed-

’ ster, he was excelled by no : guard in

this section.“ “Red” ranked ﬁrst in
the numlber of field goals per game

among the guards of the Tri—State
L district.

In the game at West Vir-
ginia, he made seven goals “from -the
