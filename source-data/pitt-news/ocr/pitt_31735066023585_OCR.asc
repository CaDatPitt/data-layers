Tower B Lounge Replacement Sparks Protest

Bv VALERIE JACHIMOWICZ
The Pitt News Staff Writer
The Tower ‘ B Hall council

announced that they will hold a
meeting to discuss the replacement

* of lounges with temp housing for

the press and concerned Tower B
residents on Tuesday, December 9,
at 8:00 PM in Lothrop Hall’s Grand
Lounge.

Chip Johansen, a resident of the

-twelfth ﬂoor, said that rumors

started about the removal of the
lounge when workmen were seen
measuring the windows of the

twelfth ﬂoor lounge (cardboard is

put in the windows of lounges when
they are converted to temporary
housing).

Kevin Keown, the R.A. on the
twelfth ﬂoor, spoke to Director of
Housing Don Hughes, and was told
that if there were more applicants

for housing than there were rooms
available, the lounges would be
converted to housing.

This information sparked a
movement in Tower B to convince
the Housing Office that the
Lounges should not be replaced,
according to Rhys Thomas, the
Tower B hall council publicity
chairperson.

Petitions have been circulated on
all the floors in Tower B, Thomas
said. He added that signs
informing residents of the situation
have been posted, and that plans
are being made to inform parents
of the Housing Office’s plans.

Thomas said that residentsuare
being encouraged to have their
parents call or write to the Housing
Ofﬁce and express their dissatis-
faction with Housing’s plans.

He added that the Pittsburgh
Press and Post-Gazette have also
been informed of the situation.

Hughes said that the Housing
Office has every intention of
notiﬁng the Dorm Hall Councils of
the decision. ‘

He added that we haven’t quite
assessed what we are’ going to do.

Hughes said that they are‘ still
receiving housing applications for
the winter term, and didn’t as yet
have a complete count of the
students who will _ be vacating
resident halls at the end of the Fall
Term. » _

We may very well need to utilize
the lounges as temporary housing”
Hughes said.

He added that “no lounge that
was used inthe Fall Term will be
used for the Winter Term.”

r ‘_‘We have the responsibility to 

give as many students the

residence life experience as possi-

ble. The students themselves

should share in that experience,”
7 Hughes said.

Robert G. Scanlon was named Secretary of Education for
the Commonwealth of ‘Pennsylvania in January 1979. He
earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Duquesne
University and a doctor of education degree from Pitt in
1966. He was an_elementary teacher and administrator
prior to his appointment in 1972 as executive director‘ of
Research for Better Schools, Inc., ‘a Philadelphia-based

regional education laboratory.

Scanlon achieved national recognition as a proponent of
individualized instruction in elementary schools and was
instrumental in making the Research for Better Schools
laboratory a major research and development resource for
school improvement in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and

Delaware. L

Scanlon was on Pitt’s campus this Tuesday where he was
the featured speaker for the annual Inter-Fraternity
banquet. The following interview with The Pitt News was

‘ conducted by Pitt News staff writer Scot Stone after the

banquet.

Q: What is the role of your department in terms of higher

education?

A: We’re responsible for managing.the resources of all
those schools that use public monies, that would be from
community colleges to state owned and state-related
universities. We also have the responsibility of developing
the standards that are used in our professions and in our
schools. —We constantly ﬁnd ourselves in an advocacy role,

Pitt professor says pigeons are sensitive to earthquakes

Pigeons ﬁnding Legi

By MIKE MALLINGER
The Pitt News start Writer

The pigeon, known to most cities
as a scavengerfor bread crumbs,
has found new legitimacy as a
predictor of earthquakes. .

Dr. Melvin Kreithen, who is
setting up his laboratory in
Crawford Hall, after a move from
Cornell to Pitt, says that animals,
especially pigeons, are sensitive to
earth tremors and have been
accurate predictors of earthquakes
for at least 3,000 years.

He cited developments with
animals as earthquake predictors in
China and Japan. Civil officials in
many areas there have instructed
farmers to report any odd animal
behavior. ‘During earth tremors
animals refuse to stay inside
manmade structures.

Cows and horses when forced
inside will kick their way out.

Even non-domesticated animals
behave unusually during times of
seismographic activity. Snakes in
hibernation come to the surface of
the ground and freeze to death.

Just these incidents, on a
widespread "scale, caused the
Chinese to evacuate the city of Hai
Cheng in 1975‘.

“It pays to begin investigating to
improve forecast ability by looking
at animals.” Kreithen added.
“Animals may tell us that we
instruments.
There is plenty of recorded history
of animals running around before
earthquakes."

Animals are as sensitive as the
best seismographs.

“It’s pretty clear that birds have
information about the geology of
the earth that we don’t have,”
Kreithen said,

But science has made great
strides in predicting earthquakes
through the compilation of data
about earthquakes zones. Earth-
quakes are a lining up then a
relieving of the stress of ﬂoating
rock in the earth. Any quake above
4.5 on the Richter scale can be
detected worldwide. —

Quakes occur in regions where
pressure builds up between rock
layers.

“It’s, not easy to predict exactly
where that earthquake is going to
be,” Kreithen said, “though
sensors close to the earthquake
zone can detect small tremors as
early warnings.”

Kreithen works with several
dozen pigeons he brought with him
from Cornell, housed in a newly

built pigeon coop atop Langley

Hall.

“There’s more navigation inside _

that bird’s head than there is in a
747 Jumbo Jet,” Kreithen said
while grasping a pigeon.

Kreithen also’ experiments with
the homing instinct of pigeons.

Panthers Defeat Bonnies,

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
“""Pitt News Sports Writer

Before the season started, new

‘coach Roy Chipman stated that his

team would get better as the
season progressed. After Tuesday,
that thought becomes , deliciously
appealing.

Chipman’s Panthers, whose po-
tential wasn't supposed to appear
until sometime in mid-season, are
way ahead of schedule. Against St.
Bonaventure, a team picked by
some to win the Eastern Eight and
by many to challenge, the Panthers
showed that they are a force to be
reckoned with now. This can be
concluded by the fact that the
Panthers beat a team ‘whose 14
year record at Reilly Center was an
outstanding 160-17.

The fact that the Panthers won
raised some eyebrows, but the fact
that they did so by 16 points turned
some heads. The Panthers had ﬁve
players in double ﬁgures and after
ﬁve minutes of the second half
were never challenged.

It wasn't supposed to be that
easy. With Earl Belcher and Mark
Jones, the Bonnies had two of the
better players in the - league.
Belcher, a veritable scoring

machine, was the sixth leading -

scorer in the nation last year.
Jones, in the opinion of his coach
Jim Satalin, is the best guard in the
Eastern Eight. Add those two to
the murderous Reilly Center and
you've got one tough opponent.
Pitt, however, was not phased by
it at ‘all. Instead of playing
intimidated, like most of Pitt’s

predecessors, the Panthers took it

to the Bonnies and seemed to dare

A , them to show their _stuff.

Senior center Ed Scheuermann,

whose 12 points was the most‘

pleasant surprise of the game.
said, “We were nervous in the
beginning but after we stayed close
to them we felt we could beat
them."

Scheuermann, who played a
strong 38 minutes, looked like he

4 belonged at center for the first time

in almost two years. Nowhere to_be
found was the confused look that

plagued him last year. Free of
injuries and playing everyday he
seems to be getting back the feel of
the game that can only come with
activity.

Scheuermann’s play was, how-
ever, overshadowed by a host of
other Panthers. Balance was one
key to this Panther win. Lennie
McMillan, Sam Clancy, Carlton
Neverson, and Dwayne Wallace
had 18, 17, 21, and 11 points
respectively. For McMillan it was
by far his best performance as a
Panther. Not only did he pour in a
career high 18vpoints but also had a
big part in Pitt’s sterling defensive
effort with 6 takeaways. Chipman
talked about his forward.

“Lennie has extremely quick
hands and he’s playing very well.
Clyde is a good player but he’s
going to have to work to get by
Lennie.” '

Chipman was alluding to Clyde
Vaughn, the highly recruited
forward who displayed some of his
shooting touch with a couple of
long jumpers.

Clancy appears to be playing
with more intensity, with more
abandon. On orders to shoot more,
Clancy has poured in 18 and 17
points in Pitt’s ﬁrst two games. He
has seemingly regained some of
that old form with some strong
inside play.

It was the play of the guards,
however, that turned the game
around. With the ever-consistent
Neverson and the catalyst Wallace,
the Panthers have two guards
whose defensive talents are only

Panther Grapplers Host Penn State Tonight

When the Pitt Panther wrestling

P team takes to the floor tonight
 against Penn State. many followers

of the sport may not recognize it as
the Panthers team of old.
Head coach Rande Stottelmyer is

, looking to transform the team into
‘one that is a constant contender for

eastern if not national supremacy.
And it seems that he might just
have all the necessary elements at

 his disposalthis season.

“We recruited a lot of good kids

, last year,” said Stottelmyer. “Put

them together with the people
returning from last year and we'll
have a good season.

“Our biggest problem this year

:will be that we are a young team.

'We have four freshmen starting
‘this year,” he said. “That means
that our freshmen are going to have
to mature real quick."

The Panthers have also altered

their schedule a bit this year. “We
have backed off from teams like

Michigan, Michigan State and
Oklahoma, but we still have to
ineet a lot of the_ big eastern
powers,” Stottelmyer. said. .In the

sive showing. I

“We did exactly what we set out
to do in both of the pre-season
matches. We picked up some
experience and -in the process we
had some fun.”

Stottelmyer added that Pitt
grapplers Glenn Maxwell (125
pounds) and Mike Bond (155
pounds) turned in good perfor-
mances against some top flight
seventh-ranked
Kentucky, West Virginia, Cornell
and Penn State.

Maxwell is a senior while Bond is
a returning junior.

Another returning starter, Pat
Connor who wrestled last year at
177 pounds and 190 pounds. was
lost last week to a knee injury.

“We’re not certain at this point
about the extent of his injuries."
Stottelmyer said.

Connor's return will rest com-
pletely on the results of tests
conducted to determine how
seriouslyhis knee is damaged.

Coach Judy Saurer and the 2-1
Pantherettes host the seventh
annual Pitt Women’s Invitational
Basketball Tournament this week-
end at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.
Interestingly, the Pantherettes had
one loss going into last year’s
tournament, when they defeated
Penn State in the ﬁnals, 58-45.
More importantly, the win cata-
pulted the Pantherettes into the top
20. This year’s eight team
extravaganza is headlined by three
pre-season top 20 teams and
showcases four All-America can-
didates. ‘

Here’s a capsule summary of
the teams and their personnel.

PITT'- The defending champ-
ions are ranked 20th in pre-season

polls,with virtually all of last year’s

Robert Klein knows he's funny.

was downright warm and

Klein answered the phone him-
self and immediately put me at
ease.- He didn't act like I was just
another two-bit journalist wasting
his invaluable time. Instead, he
gave me a feeling of importance
that I have never experienced

By GEORGE SHANER

_ Very interested in this,

Since 1975, the Pittsburgh New Music
Ensemble has sought to bring people to a
better understanding of their musical
culture now, not the culture of a hundred
years ago. 1

This is to the benefit of several groups
of people. The general audience who
might otherwise not learn about a new
vista of cultureyprofessional musicians
who might not get a chance to play this

‘ kind of music; finally, there's the com-
poser who might otherwise see his music

molder away. unplayed and forgotten.

David Stock, the conductor, and the

original organizer of the Ensemble had
the idea for such a group many years
before 1975. He is originally from Pitts-
burgh, and for the 11 years before "75
he taught around the country. When he
returned, he swung into action seeking
support for his ideas.

Although Stock ran into a lot of what
he called "non-interest" and he "got
all kinds of varying responses, from im-
possible to who cares," hedid find sub-
stantial support at WQED and Chatham
College.

The late Jack Sommers, who was
station manager at WQED radio, was
According to
Stock, "Anything that sounded unique
and exciting. . .and enriching the
cultural life of the city, he wanted the
station to be a part of."

They provided more than just interest.
Before the New Music Ensemble was in-
corporated as a non-profit organization ,
WQED was the organization that han-
dled the funds and grants. They
provided expertise and enthusiasm.

' WQED also provided one other service

that was important to Stock’s plans.
"From the very beginning, we wanted
this to be a radio project. A concert sort
of comes and goes. Radio has the poten-
tial» for reaching a larger audience and
second of all, getting it out to other radio
stations.” Without radio, Stock would

have been more isolated in his, plans and

fewer people would have had the oppor-
tunity to reach some personal’ decision
on the New Music.

Chatham on the other hand, offered a
service even more basic to the Ensemble.
A place to play and rehearse. This was
via Lou Coyner, a teacher at the school.
Without this opportunity, the continued
existence of the Ensemble might have
been problematic due to the cost of
rehearsal facilities. . I

From the start, the Ensemble has con-
tinued its relationship with these two
organizations.

That the Ensemble has been able to

keep up its __work for some five years is '

proof that it has found an audience.
Today, the organization does a good job
in filling up the 250 seat hall at Chatham.
Not that it was always that way.

Stock says they were dependent on a
small, faithful body of listeners but it
was never an "insignificant" group.
Stock also emphasizes that it always
takes time to develop an audience. As
mentioned, they've done quite well in
this.

This does not mean Stock is satisfied
with the situation. As he puts it: "The

' one kind of person we've only attracted

in relatively small numbers and the area
that we'd like to get more of, is the
young people coming from more advan-
ced realms of rock and some of the new
jazz. That kind of person we think we
are natural allies with."

"When I came back to Pittsburgh, I
had no notion where I"woulcl get
musicians to do what I wanted to do. Or
whether I could get them." However,
during the time Stock had been absent, a
small group of freelance musicians had

"begun to operate in Pittsburgh. Stock

says "they could just barely exist" in Pitts
burgh. Exist they did,though,'and‘the
Ensemble could go ahead based on
Stock’s professional ideal.

This is _a relatively unusual situation.
Most groups that play modern

“classical” music dep nd either on the
teachers or s_tu_dents ,o the universities. _'

, ’The other alternative,‘ is to try nd» 3

I .

get players from the local symphonies.
Stock had considered working within

Pitt when organizing the Ensemble.
The current situation is to Stock’s bet-

ter hopes, though.

The prime satisfaction of this is that I

the professional player is able to keep
himself going through his skill. Though
not so much through the Ensemble,
Stock says, "When you take all the
‘possible jobs together, it starts to‘ ap-
proach a professional situation in terms
of being self-supporting." In addition,
there _is the satisfaction of seeing your
work put on display before the public‘.
And finally, there is the satisfactionlof
being a professional in an organization
that is yours. ' - ' ’
Naturally, there are some problems
with this. - ' -
Money is always a prime problem,
more so than in a college group in which
the members have alternative duties that
pay the rent. The "professional doesn't

have that option. The pro has to do what .

he must to make his living. Over the past
few years, Stock has lost a number of
members to the Pittsburgh Symphony
and symphonies in other cities.

When you come right down to it, the
Ensemble’s and Stock’s goal is to be a
living institution that keeps on
developing. In Stock’s view, the people_

" world. . 

Klein takes his work seriously.

Then it was my turn. I asked. 

Robert if he thought he was funny.
"Yes I do. Really, I know I'm fun-
ny. People affirm it with every one
of my performances," he said, "I've
made people laugh from Alaska to
England, though I must admit I
just couldn't pull it off in Japan."
With that, Klein admitted that
humor is a large and necessary
part of his life. However, Klein
also said that it's harder to make ‘
him laugh, but that "It's my fault." ,1
Robert is the recent star of his ‘
own radio talk show, The Robert
Klein Show, which Klein described
as a "Who's Who of Rock ’n' Roll." I
The show is carried in over 150
cities, and Klein expressed a desire
to get it aired in Pittsburgh.
A Nonetheless, the comedy of
Robert Klein is his forte. Klein
I possesses an uncanny flair for
remembering the most subtle .
details about people and situations.
Klein uses this ability to develop a
humor that has been described as .
"Based in reality, uncompromising‘
about what he sees around him,

Expertise Behind New Music Ensemble’s Success

whobenefit in the end from the Ensem-
ble are the peoplewho choose to listen.

”This part of their culture. If they
dont't get a ‘chanceto hear the music,
they don't have their own culture." .

Stock has nothing against the large
symphonies playing older material. But
with the 20th century entering its last
decades, much of the music from even
two generations ago is still considered
unsuitable ‘for larger audiences. In
Stock’smind, Beethoven and Mozart are
all very nice. They don't, however, have
more then an "Ephemeral" meaning

when our currentculture is being?’

slighted. - ‘

Though the Ensemble hasworked for
five years, it still needs manythings. It
needs more recording sessions, more
touring, more comissions, andof course,
more money. Stock isn't worried per se,
always optimistic about the future of the
ensemble. '

In the end though, what counts is

' keeping up the quality and Stock has this

to say: "We have always tried to play the
spread ‘of things. All-we want to do is
play the beststuff we can find. The
widest representation in terms of
geography and levels of reputation.”

Enough said. ’ , .
