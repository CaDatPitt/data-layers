A new method of distributing
tickets for. Pitt’s home football
games will be implemented soon,
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye announced at a
special meeting of the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) yesterday afternoon. -

The method, called the “Coupon
Exchange System,” was met with
vehement protest by representa-
tives of the Student Government
Board (SGB) andpwith suggestions
for modiﬁcation by several other
SAAC members.

The new system, which replaces
the old distribution program that
enabled students to enter the

stadium upon presentation of IDs .

and validation cards, was planned
so that overcrowding and violent
situations at- athletic events could
be avoided, according to Chancel-
lor Wesley, Posvar.

 Dispute lnflotes Pep Squod

'-7%!“-i

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Sixteen members have been
added to Pitt's women's cheer-
leading squad, resolving a dispute
over results of tryouts held this
spring.

.Twenty-two women were placed
on the squad, which last year had
only six members.

The large club has been divided
into four groups, which will rotate
each quarter during. football games
from positions in front of the
student section, alumni section and
end zones. ’ -

Only the female captain, co-
captain and six male cheerleaders
will be posted at the student
section permanently.

Several students complained‘
after the original selection of six
cheerleaders in April, when none of
the six black candidates from a
ﬁeld of 23 ‘was chosen. They
alleged the cheerleading program
was being run like a private club,
closed to outsiders.

Athletic Director Casimir Mysl-
inski then proposed to expand the
squad by adding three black
women, but the cheerleaders
rejected the plan. Instead, all the
tryout candidates were placed on
the squad and have been practicing
routines throughout the summer.

“The girls are getting along very
nicely and progressing well in skills

so. vou can shout it out to the world

[through ‘the Livewire, the Pitt
News column that airs your gripes
about ofﬁcialdom and even tries to
get replies to them.

Each week. the Livewire reporter
will investigate a special problem
for students and give a written
account of the effort in a front page
column. '

Send your problem along with
your name and phone number to

and timing,” advisor Karen Agos-
tinella said. Captain Linda
Armbruster agreed the new system
is workin. ’

“It’s very fair, but it’s also
confusing with so many girls. The
male squad has to do twice as much
work since they have to perform
routines with more than one girl,"
Armbruster said.

The cheerleading budget, fund-

ed by the Athletic Department, had _

-to be increased to cover the cost of
additional uniforms, according to
Myslinski. However, there was no
increase to provide transportation
to away games.

“We’ve never sent all _the
cheerleaders to away games in the
past. At best, we have room for
one or two on an airplane, and only
when there is extra space,”
Myslinski said. V

on a ﬁrst come-ﬁrst serve basis for
all these years,” Posvar said, “but
surveys indicate that more students
are coming to the games to watch
our winning team, and there may
be situations when there’s no room
for them in the -stadium. If
hundreds or thousands of students
were to be turned away from the
gates, a serious violence problem
could be on our hands.”

Posvar’s speculation, corrobo-
rated by Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski, was based on studies of
increased student attendance at
Panther football games inthe last
two years, and a speciﬁc instance--
last year’s Pitt-USC contest--when
the 9,200 seats in the student
section were not enough. to
accommodate those who attended.

No evidence of violent outbreaks,

-resulting" from an overcrowded

student section, is available said
SGB President Larry Platt. Posvar
contended, however, that turning
away students from a sold-out
game could invite such outbreaks.

“Whether hard evidence exists
or not,” Posvar said, “the
possibility of violence occurring in
this situation exists, and I must
face my responsibility to avoid this
possibility.”

Under tentative plans for the
Coupon Exchange System, all
full-time students at all campuses
will have the opportunity to receive
a football coupon booklet contain-
ing ﬁve color-coded coupons, one
for each home game. 15,000
coupon books will_be printed in ﬁve
batches of 3,000 tickets. Each

batch of 3,000 coupon books will i
have a distinctive color-code
sequence that is clearly distin-

Burger Chef Opens Doors

BY RICK SIEGEL

Outcrys of criticism have accom-
panied the opening of the Burger
Chef in the Cathedral basement.
These complaints, voiced loudest

by the Greek community at Pitt,‘

are based on several changes
caused by the removal of the Tuck
Shop. .
The removal of the majority of
the bench seating, menu changes
and commercialism are probably
the most unpopular modifications.
The new seating design is the
fraternity members’ biggest com-
plaint. The Tuck Shop had always
been the common meeting place

between classes for frat brothers, - I

but Burger Chef’s restaurant
seating, with the exception of four
double booths in the back, is only
feasible for groups of three or four.

Greeks also are outraged over
the elimination of the bulletin
boards that lined the Tuck Shop
walls.

Said Phi Gamma Delta member
Oscar Stevens, “They’ve taken
away our only means of communi-
cation~on campus.” »

While seating changes haven’t
seemed to make any difference to
the majority of Pitt students, the
menu change apparently has. Cold
sandwiches, soup, fresh fruit and

.yogurt, once served in the Tuck

Burger Chef, though, does offer an
extended breakfast menu.
Indications are that the food
situation will be modiﬁed soon.
Although Richard Beckett, ma-
. nager of the franchise, declined
comment to the Pitt News, Student
Government Board member Mary
Sch‘wartz said Burger Chef told her
everything should be in full
operation by the end of next week.

Dorms Ful/I;  

Commuters    
Shut Out I 

BY KEN GORMLEY

The accomodations squeeze at" ’
Pitt has crushed the plans of‘

several hundred students tolive in
the dorms this year, Director of

Housing Donovan Hughes said‘

Wednesday. .

At least 200 students applying 
for University Housing were "
informed there was no room for" _
them on campus, Hughes said, but i,
these ' were mostly commuters 4,
interested in sampling campus life. 0

“No returning upperclassmen or f
freshmen were denied housing. by‘ 5
the University if they followed the‘, f
proper procedures,” Hughes in-'f

sisted.

He went on to say some transfer _
students, as well as commuters,‘ f
were refused living quarters on

campus. “But we notiﬁed ‘them

several months‘ ago that we’ ,
couldn’t accommodate them,” 
Hughes said. “Andwe returned 1

any down payments made.”

Hughes pinpointed the severed “Ii

crimp in University housing to a

higher percentage of newcomers‘ 
to the University,needing housing 
than in past years, coupled with a . ’
larger ‘number of i1pperclassmen_'W J

returning to the dorms
anticipated.

The Housing Ofﬁce’s projec-
tions, made last spring, indicated
the 3,500 beds on campus would
more than sufﬁce to accommodate
the number of students wanting to
live on campus. '

The projections, ‘ Hughes ex-

than

plained, proved inaccurate by early ' ‘ Ml

summer, at which time it was

necessary to inform some students: ' A
that there was no room, and others — _
that they must live in housing other .

than the dorms. .

Temporary housing is" being,

provided in Hotel Webster Hotel
and at Carlow College for nearly

155 students. ‘Also, 14 foreign

ROTC Anticipates Upswing \

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Pitt Army ROTC officials antici-
pate a 40% enrollment increase
this fall in their program, which
was combined with programs at
Carnegie-Melon and Duquesne
during the summer.

The new plan, however, was
instituted to consolidate supplies
and administrative personnel of the
three schools and is not responsible
for the increase in students,
accoiding to Captain Wilson R.
Rutherford, assistant professor of
military science.

Rutherford cited cuts in ROTC
course requirements, a change to
optional uniform regulations and
ﬁnancial benefits as the cause of
more student» interest in the
program.

Last year between 55 and 61

students were enrolled, but Rut-I

herford said he expects 85 to 95 this
year. Approximately 40 freshmen
will be enrolled and, of those, 30%
are women.

“Because no credit is awarded
for ROTC in the College of Arts and
Sciences, classes this year will
meet for one hour per week and

require 30 minutes of outside work
in stead of three hours per week as
in the past.” Rutherford said.

ROTC enrollments increased
18-20% nationwide last year while
Pitt faced a 20% decrease,
according to Rutherford. He said
the absence of credit for ROTC may
have been responsible and he
plans to work with administrators
and students in an attempt to have
credit granted.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
voted last spring against reinstate-
ment of credit for ROTC, however,
and no action has been taken
toward a reversal of the decision.

“I do believe employment for the
future could be the reason
enrollment is now increasing,”
Rutherford added.

Under the consolidaton plan with -

CMU and Duquesne, called the
Pittsburgh Instructor Group, each
school still has its own program and
students will not have to travel to
other campuses for classes. The
supply areas for the three schools
have been combined and the
number of civil service employees
was reduced from eight to three.

. In addition, the number of

PITT INFORMAL SERIES

The University of Pittsburgh will
offer a special tour of its
internationally-known archeo-
logical dig at Meadowcroft Village
in Avella, Pa.,' Saturday, Septem-
ber 20. .

The tour, sponsored by Pitt’s
School of General Studies Informal
Course Series, will provide a full
day of exploration into man’s
history. Participants will begin
with a morning.lecture on the Pitt
campus, given by Dr. James
Adovasio, director of the Avella dig
and Pitt assistant professor of
anthropology. After lunch at the
Pitt Faculty Club, members will
travel by chartered bus to the site,
where they will be taken on a tour

just spreads inconvenience to
students over all the games.”’_

At the suggestion of most SAAC
member’_s, Moye agreed to elimi-
nate the 300 date tickets reserved
for all home games under the old
system, adding them to student
seating. The student section will
include 9,500 seats as a result.

Moye assured all SAAC mem-
bers that their objections to the
new program,’ and suggestions for
its improvement, would be con-
sidered when administrators drew
up the ﬁnal plan.

under Adovasio’s guidance. The
day will conclude with a visit to
nearly Meadowcroft Village.

Pitt’s archeological dig in Avella
recently made international news
with the announcement that
radiocarbon dating indicated the
site to be the earliest evidence of
continuous-human habitation in the
hemisphere. The Pitt Department
of Anthropology crew and their
work at Avella have been featured
in newspapers and on television
broadcasts across the country in
recent weeks.

The September 20 tour is open to
the public. Fee for the day,
including‘ parking, lunch, and
admission to Meadowcroft Village,
is $15. However, the tour size is
limited, so those interested are
urged to register now. To make

Beginning in the ’76-’77 school
year, all instructors in the
Pittsburgh Group will be cross-
accredited and, therefore, eligible
to teach courses, at any of the
schools.

The Air Force ROTC program
did not face similar reorganization
because, since Duquesne’s AF-
ROTC office was abolished this
summer, Pitt’s is‘ the only
one in the area. As a result,
students from all local colleges
must come to Pitt for AFROTC
classes.

Colonel Donald M. Goldstein,

head of AFROTC at Pitt, said he
could not say for sure until after the
first week of classes whether the
program’s enrollment will in-
crease.

New Firms Operafes

BY THOMAS WEN STON

A new food service management
company will provide better menus
and a better variety of food in the
dining halls this year, according to
Pitt Food Service Director Dick
Dearden.

The University hired Key Food
Service Management, a Pitts-
burgh-based firm, on June 27 to
replace Szabo Food Service of
Illinois, which served the Univer-
sity for two years.

Director of University Housing
and Fnod Service Tom Albert said
there have been few changes in
personnel. “The supervisors and
cafeteria workers are under Pitt
contracts that won’t expire until
December,” Albert said. “At that
time, Key‘Food Management will
negotiate a new contract.”

Key Food Service Management
has been very successful, accord-

      NEWS ROUNDUP: Summer of ’75

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

So you're back, huh?

Like most students, you probably
headed. for vacation and an
ineffectual job in April, leaving
Pitt’s soot-stained campus behind
to. do whatever it does in the
summer.

Well, in fact, the campus carries
on -in the summer just as it does in
the fall and winter--only at a slower
pace--and you missed it all while
sipping beer and telling everyone
.how smart college made you.

You’re back now though, and
you_might as wellface it..there’ll
be no more sunshine with your beer
for a,lo‘ng.while. You're going to

"have toget used.to college life

again. Tohelp you do it, here's a

‘roundup of campus news events

that happened. while you were

P . MAY

The Japan Iron and Steel
- Federation gave $1 million to Pitt’s

Asian Studies Program-'-the largest

_ grant ever given Pitt by a foreign

benefactor.
:Asian Studies Department
Chairman William Dorrill said he

I planned to spend only the interest

on the huge endowment and leave
the original sum untouched.

Pitt ROTC head Colonel John
Roehm announced plans for the
combination of the Carnegie-
-Mellon, Duquesne and Pitt ROTC
programs, effective July 1.

'Under the consolidation plan, all
ROTC instructors will operate
through Pitt’s department by either
ci_rculating among the three univer-
sities or teaching courses at Pitt to
CMU and Duquesne students
commuting to Pitt. A dip in ROTC

enrollment was cited as cause for

the moved.

The Student Government Board
(SGB) voted 5-2 to support setting
up a fast-food chain service in the
place of the Tuck Shop in the

* Cathedral basement.

The SGB pledged its support
with the qualifications that fresh
fruit and nutritional food be served
at -"the establishment, group con-
gregation « be allowed on the
premises and employes of the

Tuck Shop be integrated into other

jobs in the University with no pay
cuts. .

After weeks of uncertainty, Dr.
Charles “Ray” Coble decided to
resign, his post as executive
assistant to the chancellor, effec-
tive June 15. .

Coble, Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var’s right hand man since 1971,
returned to his native North
Carolina to become associate vice
president of planning for the
University of North Carolina.

Seventy per cent of Pitt students
said they favored the immediate
removal of convicted State Senator

.Frank Mazzei from office even

though his appeal still was

pending.

The South Side Democrat,

convicted in federal court on
extortion charges last fall, had kept
his seats in the Senate and Pitt’s
Board of Trustees while he
appealed his conviction.

The University administration

went under scrutiny by a state

review team sent from Harrisburg
to study the efficiency of Pitt’s
operational structure.

The review team, part of
Governor Shapp’s program for
improving the impact of state
dollars on community

spent one month at the University.
Its findings are to be released this
fall.

Chancellor Posvar announced in
June that the University would
study the possibility of establishing
a two-year associate degree pro-
gram.

The Pittsburgh NAACP accused
the University of poor implemen-
tation of its Affirmative Action
plan. The plan requires that the
University fill its pool of job
candidates with qualified minority.
and women applicants.

in a letter to Chancellor Posvar,
Pittsburgh NAACP chairman
Robert Pitts criticized the Univer-
sity’s inability to utilize the goods
and services of the black commun-
ity. '

The University's only public
response to the charges was made
through its director of News and
Publications, Joseph Colangelo.

“Pitt makes a special effort to
seek out qualified minority group
and female applicants,” Colangelo
said. “We’re making an honest
effort to find them."

Chancellor Posvar announced
that Pitt was exploring the
possibility of setting up an
associate degree program.

Two-year program resulting in
associate degrees would be res-
tricted to areas without access to
community colleges, Posvar noted.

A Pittsburgh-based food service
management compa’ny was
awarded contracts to manage the
dining facilities at Pitt’s Oakland
and Johnstown campuses begin-
ning June 27. .

Key Management Services,
located in Peters Township, took

summer, replacing Dr. Charles Coble, who resigned after four years in

the post.

service, a

 

 

over the job held for the past three a.
years by Szabo Food Service of
Illinois. .

In a step to pin down the size of
Pitt's impending tuition increase,
University student governments
mailed out letters to the Pennsyl-
vania Senate and House Appropria-

tions Committee asking for a stand

on commitments to higher educa-
tion in the state.

The letters, sent by the
undergraduate student Govern-
ment (SG), the School of General
Studies Cabinet (SGS), and the»
Graduate and Professional Student

-Association (GPSA), drew assur-

ances from the state on its
commitment to higher education,
but no speculation on the money to
be appropriated Pitt.

Pitt’s Student Health Service
Director Dr. JoAnne Robinson
announced the Health Center in the
Schenley quadrangle would be
closed on weekends due [to
departmental budget cutbacks.

The service cu-t, according to
University officials, was part of a
University-wide move toward re-
ducing operational costs in all
departments.

“The center will operate now
more like a family physician,"
Robinson said. “Students will
have a wait until‘-Monday morning

-before they can see a doctor. They

will be able to get treatment for
real emergencies at one of the
Oakland hospitals."

Dr. Gerhard Werner, acting
dean of the School of Medicine
since September, 1974, was for-
mally appointed dean of the school.

A professor and chairman of the
department of pharmacology since
1965, Werner assumed the position
after officiating in the absence of
former dean Donald N. Medearis.

The American Association of
University Professors [AAUP] was
announced as the favorite choice as

a bargaining group if and when a _

University-wide vqte on faculty
unionization occurs? according to a.
survey taken by three members of
the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIAJ.

The survey, which sampled the
opinions‘ ‘of 99 tenure stream
faculty members, showed the
AAUP to be almost twice as
popular as"the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU).‘and three times as
popular as the Pennsylvania State
Educational Association (PSEA) as
a choice to represent Pitt faculty.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees adopted
a proposal designating the Pitt
News as the University-wide
student newspaper. V.

Essentially approving the orig-
inal recommendation of the Pitt
News Study Commission, the
Trustees stopped short of charter-
ing the paper, saying that to do so
might be an interference in student
affairs.

Under the funding policy .
adopted with the designation, the
paper will draw money for its
operations from graduate and
undergraduate student govern-
ment funds automatically set aside
for that purpose. Previously. the
paper had to bargain for an annual
allocation.

Tuition remission benefits--free
and lowered tuition for Pitt’s staff
members and their families--will
possibly be discontinued as a result
of a measure brewing in the state
General Assembly, Chancellor
Posvar announced at a Senate
Council meeting.

Posvar said the assembly’s
feeling against the tuition remis-
sion program was another mani-
festation of legislators’ resentment
and misunderstanding toward pro-
fessional faculty members, but that
action on the bill wouldn't be ﬁnal
until the next budget year.

Testimony at the Pitt faculty
union hearings concluded with the
record said to be complete on
central issues involving determina-
tion of a bargaining unit, and with
elections projected for November.

The hearings lasted nearly 38
days and involved testimony by
more than ‘I00 witnesses.

The University counseling and
placement services were merged
into one unit--the University
Counseling and Placement Center--
headed by former Counseling

 

Jack Daniel has charged many‘ undergraduates are receiving
inadequate educations because, though Pitt is bringing in more
minority and first generation scholars, teachers are not prepared to

teach them.

Director Robert Gallagher.

The merger, which took effect
following the death of Placement
Director Ernest Holmok, came
after a year of planning and
development by Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye.

Many undergraduate students at
Pitt, especiallylthose in the College

of Arts and Sciences [CAS], are

receiving an inadequate education,
Assistant to the Dean of CAS Jack
Daniel charged at an SGB meeting.

Daniel said the University is
bringing in more women, blacks,

and first generation scholars to Pitt’

than before, but the teachers are
not prepared to teach them.

Daniel said he came to this
conclusion after reviewing ‘studies
he performed in his own classes,
surveys of graduating students,
and personal contact with several
Pitt -students and teachers.

Last of the Big Spenders

BY PAUL MAZUR

How beastly the bourgeois is

Especially the male of the species.

D. H. Lawrence

A pox on bad economic news.
Rising prices with disproportionate
wage increases and infernal wheat
deals dominate the news.

The local media sponsor con-
;sumer reports giving advice on
where to make the best buys.

Students have it especially
tough. Tuition increases, high
rents,-the high price of food and
entertainment, not to mention the

7’; _.,cost of books, have apparently
‘’’-‘-’made life less than bearable for
most students.

Yet not all of us are ready to
cross the Styx. Tired of listening to
economic horror stories; tired of
reading about how to save money, I
decided to look around Oakland for

  

You can own this sleek Mercedes, complete with sunroof and tape

some of the more expensive buys.
After all. we're not all poor.
Since rent is the curse of the

, student. the sensible solution is to

buy a house and eliminate rent.
Several houses are for sale for
$15,000; but a nice two-story brick
house with a yard can be bought for
$24,000. It has a furnished kitchen.
The living room is a very
important part of the house. To
furnish that room S. Binstock
Jewelers has a seven-piece modern
living room set, including sofa,
chair, glass coffee table, two glass
end tables and two all-purpose
tables for $1,350. A Zenith l9”
color television [$479] completes
the room. . ,
And for those interested in
decorative.silver plate, Binstock
carries a complete line with a
silver-plated samovar ($131) and

. ice bucket ($66).

No house is complete without a
sound system. A Revox tape deck

player, for a paltry $20,428--so don’t forget to apply for a student loan.

_A800 ($1.800) can be ordered at
Audio Warehouse, along with a.

precision Thorens turntable (TD-
l25ABMIl) for $410 and a pair of
Bose 901 speakers with stands for
about $1000.

A few more items would go well
in a living room. For example, a

tall three-stemmed brass water_

pipe can be purchased at the Hare
Krishna Boutique for $65. While
there, it might be useful to pick up
two decorator gnus for $21 and a
miniature gong for $10.50.

Finally, the Martial Arts Supp-
lies store on Oakland Avenue is
selling a large oriental sword in a
black scabbard for $150. Not only a
decorator item, the dual-purpose
sword also can provide needed
protection in Oakland.

Food is always an important
concern. Of course, anyone
properly attired can order a
medium—rare steak dinner with
cocktails and wine at Black Angus
for about $35. But for those who
prefer to do their own cooking, the
Imported Foods Store sells delica-
cies such as green muloukhie
leaves for $2.25 per can and
preserved mangoes, $1.15 per can.

For that housewarming party,
lsaly’s carries some 20 flavors of
ice cream. At $6.50 per 2‘/2 gallon
tub for each flavor, it would be
possible to order $130 worth of ice
cream.

In Pittsburgh, it is hard to move
around without a car, but a visit to
Mervis Motors can solve that
problem. There, on the display
floor, is a chocolate-colored Mer-
cedes-Benz 450 SL sedan automatic
with a automatic sun roof, cassette
tape player and air conditioning.
Its complete price--$20,428.

A lot of money can be spent in

one day in Oakland. The total of

Though it's customaryto make New Year’s resolutions on January 1,
those of us who live within the conﬁnes of the school year ﬁnd it hard to
feel a sense of beginning in January, save those who have bumbled and
blundered through the fall term and are lookmg forward to a second
chance in the winter.

Itisnowthatweﬁndomselvesatthestartofanother New Year, and
‘resolutionsarebeingnndebythosewhowishtoaocomplishvarious
goals.

It is to our advantage that the New Year begins now, giving us a
summer’s change of pace to mull over what has passed and what is to
come. Strangely enough, summer is usually a period of limbo for most
students, a time that seems to come about as a reward or as a mere.

' — respite; regardless of how summer presents itself, there. is something

in the season that constantly warns of its temporariness, its
look-but-don't-touch aura.

And so the time from April to September passes as a brief ﬂirtation,
and many are caught unawares of what lies on'the other side of Labor
Day. '

as if dying for lack of refreshment, and we slosh it down, every bit of it,

listening to an intro lectrne at nine, and wondering dumbfoundedly

have been catapulted into class and have never recovered from the first

. shock.

. We come to resent being here, we decide that we hate it, and all

because at the very beginning we neglected to shift gears and ease into
the new situation. ,

_ It would serve us all well to take careful stock of what we’re up
against this year and think about how we’d like things to turn out.

from hindsight that few years are as decisive as the critics nuke them
out to be. p - ‘ ‘

But we can say in all honesty that the '75-’75 school year will be a
determining one at Pitt, chieﬂy because of the faculty unionization vote
scheduled for later this term. -

We must never underestimate the_times we are in, or fail to grasp
the importance of news items as they crop up daily. Though faculty
unionization is often complex and ﬁlled with numerous characters,
students should not succumb so easily to bewilderment.

DespitethefactthatthosestudyingatPitttodayfeeltheoutcomeof

innocently enough in their  schools and their high schools, having .

no notion whatsoever about coming to Pitt, let alone worrying about the
affects of faculty rmionization. But they nevertheless will be here. And
they will be forced to contend with any problens that may have arisen
out of a vote taken back in ’75-’76.

‘ Faculty unionization will be the most consequential decision on this
campus since it moved for state relation in the sixties. And if students
resolve to do one thing this year, it should be to inform themselves on
the issue and take a stand. Though the deliberations may span several
months and the vote be completed in only several minutes, Pitt

V students will be affected for decades ‘to come.

New dilemma

BY MATT KAMBIC

What is the .most serious
I problem on college campuses

' . today? Many might think it to be

crime‘, tuition hikes, warm water
fountains or poorly written grafﬁtti
on rest room walls. But all of these

V problems pale before the real

disaster we are facing, that is: the
severe lack of a real problem.

Many will suggest that we have
more difficulties now than ever
before. But hold! Not one of these
problems will take the initiative to
rise above the others; none leaves
us running to mother or tottering
on the brink of physical and mental
doom. Will we be forced to create
something of paramount wrong-
ness, or will Murphy’s Law take
hold and ease the knuckle-cracking
tension? Can man take some of his
. more common day to day chokes
and blow them up to a reasonable
V level of severity? Something must
he done soon.

In recent years, Mr. Nixon ﬁlled
this dangerous void with impres-
sive credentials. "We rallied behind
him, sensing the smooth manner
with which he would transform a
sedatevand uncaring public into a
mass of frenzied Gallup Poll
statistics’. His record as a problem
is almost untouchable, but we
cannot hope to stretch his massive
mismanagement indeﬁnitely. He
is gone. . We must search and hope

Lack of a Problem i

for a disturbance that is his equal
while we cherish the fear he
brought to our hearts.

Can we count on inﬂation and
unemployment to overwelm us?

It's a nice thought, but it would be '

fatal to count on something so
intangible and unstable to do the
trick. No, it is up to us--the
students--to analyze, decide upon,
and then reinforce a problem that
will leave us in no doubt of its’
effect. It must, quite simply, scare
the living hell out of us.

Perhaps an‘ assemblage of the
most twisted minds in the
community could aid students in
their quest. Perhaps this gathering
itself could become the problem.
History majors might want to
search the cronicles of man’s past
and ferret out our most dismal
tragedies for possible duplication.
Math majors might search for a
calculation ' whose solution would
render useless certain accepted
principles such as addition and
subtraction. Chemistry students
might change a few appropriate
labels on certain test tubes or even
steal the department chairman's
bifocals. .

Regardless, the need for this
people-uniting problem is growing.
so critical that it may become the
problem : itself, eliminating our.
worries of its lack and re-establish-
ing our fears of its existence.

Mom .
Before it ’s too late

BY DAN MULHOLLAND

For the past decade or so, the cry
for increased control of the sale and
possession of ﬁrearms has been
repeated with increasing shrillness
by members of the ' liberal
establishment. We have been told
that guns are responsible for the
soaring crime rate in this country,
and that if they were banned,
America would become a second
Garden of Eden.

In addition, we have been led to
believe that those who oppose
these stricter regulations are
atavistic fanatics bent on satiating_
their wild bloodlust. It is high time
that the true facts be brought to
light in order to explode these
media-inspired fantasies.

In the first place, ﬁrearms are

- not responsible for the rising tide of

lawlessness,» or ..even remotely
related to it. This was proven in a
recent study at Penn State that
found only 3% of all crimes
committed involve any type of
ﬁrearm. The study also revealed
that only 0.0028% of all firearms
are involved in crime.

Joan Little ’s trial

And even in these few instances,_
it is notthe gun that is responsible
for the crime, but rather the
individual using it.

The solution should be obvious:
instead of unfairly penalizing the
99% -plus of honest gun owners, we
should instead step up the war on
the criminal element.

Unfortunately, lawmakers in
several states seem oblivious to
these facts. In New York, for
instance, where one of the toughest
anti-gun laws is in effect, crime
runs rampant. In the meantime,

-decent citizens who might have

used their guns to protect
themselves and theirfamilies are
placed in mortal terror. This is one
case in which an old adage has
been borne out in real life: “When
guns are outlawed, only outlaws
will have guns.”

However, an even more insidious
side to gun control is that it-is a
thinly veiled attempt by the power
elite to gain total control, despite
the fact that any sort of gun control
is unconstitutional. The Second
Amendment clearly states ..that
“the right of the people to_keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed.”

 

But even this precise language
might be ignored by the Supreme
Court, which has made it its
business to insure every possible
“right”for ‘the criminal vis-a-vis
his victims.

When this is done, America will
belittle different than Red China or
Nazi Germany, where the first act
in the final consolidation of
dictatorial power was the abolition
of private ownership of firearms.

What can be done to prevent
this? In the first place, we can tell
our lawmakers that we oppose any
further infringement on our rights. I
The House is currently considering
a proposal by the Executive Branch
that would ban the sale of all
handgun ammunition.

Leading the ﬁght against this
unconstitutional, backdoor ap-
proach to gun control is the
National Rifle Association.
Through its committee on legisla-
tion, the NRA is doing its best to
protect our liberty. By giving it our
support, we can be sure that in the
long run, its fight will be
successful. But if we fail, we will
ultimately fall victim to the wiles of
the criminals.

The Political Left as Jury

BY TOM WASELESKI

Long gone are the days when a
trial, even a controversial one, was
watched with close, almost insat-
iable observation by a nation of
newspaper readers whose sole
intent it was to follow the testimony
and await the verdict as one awaits
the come-what-may climax in a
suspense-mystery.

Nowadays, for better or worse,
we Americans have opinions on
everything--too often preconceived
and therefore premature--and we
cast them about so freely that a
foreign observer might think this is
either a nation of experts or just a
bunch of people who .like to toot
their own horns.

The acquittal of Joan Little, a
black inmate, in the stabbing death
of a white prison guard Clarence
Alligood (notice the key adjectives)
will give bigots and liberation
leaders alike much to crow about in
months to come, not that they
haven’t been crowing all along.

When racial leaders and femin-

ists see the acquittal as a victory for ‘

their respective movements, we
wonder what it is these groups are
really seeking. When socialists
don “Free Joan Little” buttons and
campaign for her release, we
wonder if they are really up on the
facts in the case and the process of
American law.

First of ‘all, it is true that Little
stabbed Alligood to death--this she
did not refuse to admit. . Such
uncommon‘ behavior deserved a
trial by jury, despite her sex and

‘race. and those who would like to’
see these characteristics exempt
her ” from prosecution. '

Liberation groups who immedia-
tely seized on-the Little trial as a
soapbox from which to peddle their
wares used Joan Little as a pawn.
There was no need for feminists or
civil rights spokespersons to come
to the “aid” of the defendant in the
North Carolina trial. There was no
evidence that Little was going to be
given an unfair trial.

Though the political left has been
denied due process in several
notable trials of the late sixties and
early seventies, there _was no
justification for its pouncing on the
Little case, for after the piling on
was over. the. radic-libs (though
they'll never admit it) found
nothing there.

This brings into question the true
merits of the leadership of
American liberation movements
and their sense of judgment on
what the real issues are. Joan
Little was obviously an easy,
almost cost-free way to put the
movements once again in the
limelight, and with the _ use of
propaganda, to show them “win-
ning.” It is this kind of political
pouting that discredits the move-
ments and their noble aspirations,
and it is this sort of non-discrimin-
ate seizure of an issue that is in the
long run self-defeating.

No conversion of racists or
chauvinists to more .humanitarian
ways of thinking
resulted from the trial’s publicity.
Brgots who normally proclaimed
‘with -cynicism that Little would be
acquitted because she was black
and female need more cool
reasoning towin them ‘over than
“Free . Joan _Little'." buttons «and
proclamations of “victory.” .

could have ‘

  m :5. .‘-.2’) :1.) .3‘

recklessness applied in the Joan
Little non-issues by feminists and
civil rights advocates that their goal

Let’s Control Crime—i-Not Guns  

is not to change biased thinking, ﬁg
but to impose a coup d’etat on the" 

judicial system in the United States
whether the people believe in those
ideals or not.

It is especially unfortunate that
Joan Little herself does not
understand the extent to which she
has prostituted herself for the sake
of these movements. She probably
has been more exploited by her
“liberators” than by those who
would discriminate against her
because she is black and female.

Upon acquittal, Little said, “I’
knew that if the people stood
together, ‘we would win." The fact
nevertheless remains that Joan
Little did not need the “people” to
“win.” By the same token, if she
had “lost,” it would not have been
because she was black and female.
At least not at this trial.

The jargon used in controversial
American trials owes too much of
its meaning to sport, and the
casting of Joan Little. as the

underdog favorite for whom we are .

urged to root makes the law appear
to be a game. It should be noted
thatany achievement the political
left seeks in the courts will be only
as great as it holds those courts to
be.

That Joan Little “won,” or
rather more significantly, that she
was found innocent of the charge
against her, was not because of
feminists or civil rights leaders who
spoke on her behalf or because of
tin buttons that were passed out on

Panther Hollow, “but we wanted
something that was as non-
upsetting toithc public as poss-
ible.”

The idea behind the farm is
simple: Von Mastif and his
business partners, who preferred

to remain anonymous, have con-—

structed a complex of holding pens
where they say they eventually will
be able to raise more than 10,000
dogs, 30,000 cats and 100,000 rats
each year. '

Although the growth rate for the

first several years is expected to be

much lower than the maximum
ﬁgures, Von Mastif reports that
when full production is reached,

' ‘the output‘ of the farm “could feed

the city of Pittsburgh almost
singlehandedly.” '

It will work like this: The dogs
will be "the basic unit of food
production.

The dogs will be slaughtered,
packaged and sold under various
brand names as a regular super-
market item. In turn, by-products
from the slaughter house will be
fed to the farm’s rats. The rats will

be fed to the cats, and the cats will.‘

be fed -to the dogs. Ideally, Von
Mastif reports, the farm will be
self-sustaining, and, except for

Von Mastif recently took a group

rigidly segregated in terms of area.
You remember that the illumin-
ated map was in the shape of a
three-pointed star with a hollow
center? The center will house the
slaughter-house and packaging
plant, as well as experimental
laboratories. We already are
experimenting to find additional
uses for the products of the Puppy

 Nomuzlly speaking’ a

long ago, the state of Indiana was a .

stronghold of the Klu Klux Klan.
The governor, and the mayor of

" Indianapolis, were busted and sent

to the slammer on charges arising

_ from murderous Klan activities.

It remains now only to make the
law so inclusive that if you are
caught thinking about mariiuana,
pot, hash, joints, reefers, etc. ad
infinituin; if; in your home, you are
caught with a dictionary containing
the word marijuana, look out.

A You’re headed for the clink.

Sociological theory, No.
of social paradigms, ﬁnally has
emerged and come to roost within

the discipline. It joins there a lot of

; other rare birds.‘ But it is_a step in

century of American social life and
behavior, he will ﬁnd more than a
modicum of suggestion that some
elite organizations are, indeed,
deviant.

Usually Americans in the rank-
and-file call deviant just about
anything they don’t like or don’t
approve of, a redundancy. If
someone asked me to list things I’d
call deviant, the list would include,
to name a few, the KKK, Indiana,
people who don’t smoke pot,
peeping Toms and nosy neighbors,
oral-anal activities except when the
Establishment makes one eat shit,
mathematicians, pro football fans,

son, Archie Buiiker, Fred Sanford

considered LBJ the paradigmatic
classical politician, like Dave
Lawrence, and one to be admired
and supported. I had to concur on
this "point. I think he would have
approved of marijuana use because
he hated drug abuse. Such
approval, as far as I’m concerned,
would have been typical of the
attitude towards grass that all
states should develop. Back to elite
group deviance.

Near the top of my list of
deviants would be the American
Psychiatric Association. The
shrinks make a specialty out of
deviance. Deviance keeps them in
business. If there is no deviance
for them to shrink, they’ll
manufacture some. That’s what a
shrink called Szasz said circa 1970
about his brethren and sistern.
Right now they’re trying to make
the aging process not only deviant
but sinful. Sinful because,

assuming their medical role of .
- omniscience,’

assuming omnipo-

tence, they have God’s ear,
probably in formaldehyde. Thomas
Szasz, MD, described their busi-
ness, related to the state, as the
manufacture of madness.

_,:,,_students have made in
i ' “University power structure and that

-\

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

By the end of thisiterm, there
may be a faculty union in power on

this campus. If so, the University

as we know it will be radically
altered.

Faculty unions, the result of an
idea spreading across the nation
that university teachers should
organize to protect themselves
economically and professionally, is
still a new and immeasurable topic.
Its effects on each campus can be

' different.

There is fear in_some quarters,
however, that the rise of faculty
unionization will eclipse the gains
the

negotiations over the bargaining
table may effect student interests
adversely.

In the 40 days of testimony
completed in recent months con-
cerning faculty unionization, there
was no single signiﬁcant mention
of “students" or “student inter-

ests," according to one University

official.

Well, if faculty unionization will
change things this much, here are a
few things you might want to know.

THE ORIGINS OF FACULTY
UNIONIZATION

These are tough times, and
throughout this state, colleges are
faced with tough retrenchment
policies. The Golden Days of the
university are over, as one union

representative put it, and many
administrations are facing tighter
budgets and stiffer demands from

— the legislature.

“I made more money killing
people in Vietnam than I made as a
teacher,” said one union organizer.
“I think there’s something wrong
with that.”

With money becoming harder to
find for expansion, in fact, with
many colleges shrinking both
course offerings and faculty, the
members of the teaching staffs in
many universities are organizing to
protect their pocketbooks.

The economics, of course, is just
the surface issue. There are many
factors involved, including a
frustration felt by some faculty with
the machinations of in-house
governance procedures, tenure
policies and promotion.

All of these things would, could
and maybe dealt with by unions.

One might speculate that there is
also a determination among some
faculty to re-establish some sort of

decision-making power in the giant '

workings of the paracorporate
university system, power that has
been increasingly abdicated to
professional administrators over
the pastyears.

Of course there is the whole
litany of personal reasons, which
will differ from teacher to teacher
and from professor to professor,
but which all add up to a turning
towards faculty unionization.

These basic reasons, money and
power, are similar to the reasons
for the original striving _for

unionization for the blue collar

worker. .

Money and power, perhaps the
ultimate concern of unions and
their members, could well be the
roots of unionization here at Pitt.

THE UNION STRUGGLE AT PITT

All unions strive to encompass as
many people as possible, increas-
ing their supply of capital and their
political power as well, the largest
unions being able to exercise the
greatest influence over administra-
tive actions.

As organizations, unions natur-
ally are concerned with self-
preservation, and in a biological
sense there I is a form of
evolutionary stress on those organ-

.- izations that fail to grow, fail to

expand and fail to increase the
scope of their power.

In short, weak unions are
annihilated. At the bargaining
table the interplay of diplomacy,
threat and coercion rests on the
relative energy of the union and
administration involved.

There are three unions that are
striving to lock up the University:
the Pitt Professional Union (PPU),
the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) and
the Pennsylvania State Education
Association (PSEA). ' .

One of these unions may be the

Analysis: The Faculty Unions, Money 8: Power  

one voted into power sometime this
term. One of these unions could
well be the one that will change the
face of the University permanantly.

Each of these unions is plugged
into a larger national framework;
the PPU interlocks with the
American Federation of Teachers,
the AAUP interlocks with the
National American Association of
University Professors, and the
PSEA interlocks with the National
Education Association.

Although at one time these three
unions and their national systems
differed greatly in their approach to
faculty economic problems, they
have gradually shifted positions in
the past years, and the positions
taken by locals often have been
widely different from national
policy. A

In fact the character of each local
seems to have been determined by
the attitudes of the faculty
involved, with little or no mass
coordination of policies, demands
or expectations.

It seems safe to say that a union
at Pitt, no matter what its national
program may sound like. will adapt
itself solely to the demands of the
faculty on this campus.

S

WHAT THE UNION COULD no

At the bargaining table, it is

conceivable that anything involving g

faculty committment . or’ interest
will be negotiated. ’ ' 
This may or may not include:

tenure policies, course offerings,‘ ,

academic priorities, ‘work loads,
salary and class size. I
The University Senate Council,
which includes student representa-
tives, now submits recommenda-
tions to the chancellor on these

issues, with students holding seats _I

and voting on the resolutions. ,. I -

Some faculty have found the‘

Senate inadequate to their needs,
partially because of the natureof
the council and its limited power. I

So it is entirely possible that
academic matters how handled by
the Senate Council will be dealth
with at the bargaining table.

Senate Councils in many univer-
sities have survived intact how-
ever, usually at the will of the union
on the particular campus.

For
recently indicated they viewed the
strike, or job actions, as the
prerogative of the faculty, and aspa-
tool in negotiations. There is no-
widely differing view of the strike

as a force in negotiations. . .

In hearings before the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board this
summer, the three unions‘ jostled
for a position on what population of

faculty would comprise the popu_la- _ —
_ tion of the union. ‘ I '

cellor David Kurtzman admits he’s

 trying to phase himself out of the

‘ business of education, “but,” he
adds with a smile and a quick puff
 on his pipe, “it doesn’t seem to be
‘_ working.”
I He’s the man who served as
.7.-.-chancellor in 1966 when it was
 decided that Pitt should become a
‘f state-related school and, in fact, he

 was_ the driving force behind that

-‘ decision. But now there are no

 major decisions for him to make.

After 40 years of service in the
»fields,of education and administra-
tion.--‘ten with Pitt--he’s now
[P technically retired, serving the
{ University only in an advisory
 capacity.
: ,Kurtzman’s office doesn’t look
" like a place of business. His desk is
 too neat and his open appointment

ff’ chairs that line the small but
5. comfortable room are in an orderly
' row. Even the shiny coffee pot on a
3 table behind his desk looks unused.
_ , ‘,‘Sit down, make yourself com-
; fortable,” Kurtzman says softly
‘ while striking a match to light his
pipe. He sucks and pokes
v frantically to keep it from go_ing

‘ out. Between deep puffs, he

in a neat brown suit. Fragrant
swirls of smoke encircle the man as
he speaks, giving his face an added
dimension of recumbency, and a
pile of dead matches in an ashtray
before him attest to the labor

involved in creating that dimen-.

sion. Ultimately, it’s the aroma of
pipe tobacco that is the most
notable characteristic of Kurtzman
and his office.

“There’s really not much for me
to do here,” he says, sweeping his
arms around the room. “In fact, I
could easily provide my services

"from my apartment at the Park
Plaza. lt’s justthat I can’t kick the
work habit I’ve been used to for so
long--at least not immediately. A
lot of people tell me to slow down
and reduce my office hours,
gradually retire, and I’m trying to
do it, but it’s hard work, too.”

lt’s unanimous, then. Everyone
who knows Kurtzman, including
the man himself, says he can’t kick
the work habit. The biggest part of
that habit is the office’ routine
familiar to him for 40 years.

Kurtzman served as director of
research for the Pennsylvania
Economy League in Pittsburgh,
under Mayor David Lawrence.
When Lawrence was elected
governor of Pennsylvania, Kurtz-
man hesitated, then made the
move with him, serving as
secretary of administration. Under
Governors Schaefer and Shapp,
Kurtzman served as secretary of
education.

Kurtzman’s association with Pitt
goes back to 1965, when he came
here as vice chancellor of finance in
a time of deep financial difficulty
for the University. In 1966,
Kurtzman was appointed chancel-
lor of the University following the
death of acting Chancellor Stanton
Crawford. While Kurtzman was
chancellor, it was decided that Pitt
should become a state-related
school.

Since then, Kurtzman returned

Kurtzman:   He can’t Retire 

to work for the state as superinten-
dent of public instruction, taught
courses at Pitt in higher education
administration, and served for a
while as acting‘ dean of the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs.

Currently, he is serving as
chairman of the Office of Com-
monwealth Research and Services
(OCRS), designed to assist state
legislators in attaining information
about the University and related
areas. He is a member of the
Board of Directors for both the
Allegheny Community College and
station WQED.

Having been vice chancellor for
finance and then chancellor in the
years when Pitt faced near financial
disaster and finally made the move
to a state-related status, Kurtzman
has his own tight version of how the
situation came to pass.

“We simply overextended our-
selves,” he says bluntly without
drama.
wanted to build the University up
to the top-notch class in education--
his dream was for Pitt to compete
with Ivy-League schools. Under
him, Pitt tried to offer more
services and expand at a pace that
outstripped its resources. Litch
field tried to make Pitt famous
overnight, but the money to do this
wasn’t there. Our alumni generally
aren’t as rich as the alumni of
Harvard of the other Ivy League
schools, so a lot of monetary
support was missing. Finally, after
two years of receiving $5 million
emergency grants from the state
with no more emergency grants
allowed, myself and most of the
members of the Board of Trustees
felt it was to our advantage -to
become state related to guarantee
support by the state to pay for all
the programs and services we
wanted to provide.” ,

“Which do you feel is Pitt’s more
important mission--to offer an Ivy
League-type of education, or

“Chancellor Litchfield,

 

  

Ex-Chancellor David Kurtzman can’t slow down, can’t retire, can’t
do much but continue work in his fastidiously neat office.

become a community-related and
supported school?” I ask him.

“I think a balance between the
two should be‘ struck. Pitt’s
moving in that balanced direction
today as are more and more
schools. We've still got high
admission standards, but we’ve
also got special programs
admitting underpriviledged stu-
dents and first generation students
from families that never before
could go to college. This is the
wave of education in the future,
and much of it is possible because
we’re state related."

Kurtzman says he doesn’t
believe Pitt’s status as a state-
related school has hurt the quality
of education it offers.

‘‘In many respects, Pitt is equal
to Penn, the only Ivy League school
in Pennsylvania,” he says firmly.

His pipe has been out for a while
and the smoke around the desk
clears. Kurtzman smiles broadly
and relights his pipe before
continuing.

“Pitt’s admission standards are
just as high as Penn’s and our

statistics show our graduate school

is just as popular as theirs, and our
educators, I feel, are of the very
same high quality.” _

How then, I ask, do students who
cannot enter Penn get into Pitt?

“Since we’ve got room for more
students here at Pitt, we don't have
to be as selective as Penn must be
to fill limited space. We’r_e simply
admitting more students who rate
closer to the lowest acceptable
standard of admission than they
are. Because Penn is an Ivy
League school, it attracts the very
brightest of students and it usually
only has room for them and not the
students at the lowest acceptable
standard.”

The pipe has gone out again.
Kurtzman pauses to regain his
breath and let the meaning of what
he has just said sink in. I use the
time to catch the echo of his words

iPitt’s Unsung Heroes -

30 workers in relation to the size of
property it now serves. Pitt
recently acquired more property
and the increase in workmen has
not kept pace with University
growth of 300,000 additional
square feet since 1971.

“Now, we don’t take care of the
dorms,” Merritt says, “Thank God
we don't have that to take care of.”

But the Physical Plant maintains

all other University non-leased
properties. . E
Martin, director since 1968,

maintained his organization is
improving its use of funds and, in
most cases, its quality of work.
“We have to look at operating
cost per square foot,” Martin tells,
“We’re achieving more effective
utilization of the people we have.”
“We compare ourselves to other
institutions through the Associa-
tion of Physical Plant Administra-
tors,” Merrit explains. His reports
indicate Pitt’s unit cost, or average
maintenance cost per square foot,
is consistently lower than the

average unit cost in Eastern and.

Midwest college physical plants.

Pitt’s unit cost did not change
from 1972 to 1973, but in 1974 the
cost jumped 21.1 cents to its
present 63.9 cent level.

Merritt attributes this increase to
escalation of utility costs alone.
Nonetheless, Merritt feels Pitt is
fortunate to pay only the rate it
does.

“We get steam heat _at a very low

rate compared to downtown,”'

Merritt maintained. Long ago
Andrew Carnegie founded the
Bellefield Boiler Association, a
non-profit supplier of coal-gener-
ated heat to Oakland area hospitals
and colleges.

Despite Bellefield’s non-com-
mercial nature, Merritt estimates
this year’s fuel costs will increase
37.5%.

Downtown institutions, Merritt
adds, must purchase their heat
from commercial establishments.

Both Martin and Merritt contend
one of the Physical Plant’s greatest
concerns is improving efficiency.

‘."l‘he great time-waster 1S
getting to and from the job,”
Martin says. He estimated a

maintenance man works only about
40% "of his day, travels 40%. and
sacrifices the remaining 20% to
“interruptions" such as locating
proper tools. He projects Pitt
workmen will eventually work 60%
of each workday.

“There’s an idea that most
people want to do a decent day’s
work for a decent day’s pay,”
Martin said. “We think our people
would rather do that than walk
around campus not being produc-
tive.”

“We're bringing in the Law
School without any increase in
custodial personnel," Merritt said.

By revising daytime custodial
duties the Physical Plant has made
more effective use of custodians’
time, so no more janitorial
personnel will be hired for the Law
School.

“Personnel costs will increase
about 7% (this' year),” Merritt
says. Union contracts already are

negotiated and include wage hikes.

“We are now coming to the point
where we can electronically pro-
cess.” Martin says. The Job Order
Cost System (JOCS) is a computer-
ized method ofjob assignment and
accounting.
among physical plant organiza-
tions, JOCS was instituted at Pitt
over 3 years ago. The system
estimates time and cost of a task
and ﬁles reports comparing its
estimates with actual performance.
JOCS also handles all accounting

for Physical Plant projects, both .
among the four maintenance _

departments and with outside

ﬁrms.

Merritt contends a great down-
fall of college maintenance pro-
grams is deferring maintenance to
hold down expenses. He believes
this practice actually spawns
greater maintenance problems and
ultimately causes great expense to
the institutions..

Kurtzman Can’t Retire
. . . Pass It On

(‘Continued from Page 12)
and scribble them down quickly
before he can say more. As I finish
the last sentence, I look over’ the
desk and watch him stuff his pipe
with fresh tobacco and light it. The
rich smoke begins to swirl around
his face.

What Kurtzman tells me about
the University is probably true
enough, but I can sense that he is
not making the policies anymore
and he misses it. Sure, his opinion
is respected and probably valued
by administrators, but it is no
longer the driving force behind
major decisions.

He still has important friends in
the state legislature--“on both
sides of the floor, Republican and
Democrat,” as he puts it--and he
makes frequent trips to Harrisburg
come budget time to exploit this
advantage for the University. This
diplomatic chore forms a substan-
tial part of his job.

But like an elder statesman, his

most important task now is to 1

comment on the ideas of those who
have come after him.

He goes to his office daily to
please a nonexistant boss and
perform duties. When he gets an
assignment he does it well, but for
the most part, he works hardest at
winding down his career.

What was his most challenging
job?

“I _ think that would be my
position as chancellor,” he says
under a halo of smoke. “I liked
working directly for students. As a
matter of fact, if it weren’t for my
mandatory retirement, I would
have liked to continue as chancel-
lot. It was the most stimulating
and rewarding job I’ve ever had.”

It's people like David Kurtzman
that make a person doubt the
appropriateness of forced retire-
ment. He’s lucky he’s got an
office, though, because he can go
there every day to smoke his pipe
and pretend he’s slowing down.

 » “Equality of rights

United States or any -

That isthe basic‘ text of the
proposed Equal Rights Amend-
ment (ERA), an amendment

battled-for over half a century, and,

as of the spring of 1973, needing

- ratification by only 8 more states to

become law.

Supporters of the ERA know the
amendment, if passed, will not be
some indefatigable s_avior for the
feminist cause--it is only a law, and

V. as such, but a tool in the struggle.

Many opponents cry the ERA
will bring about the “destruction of
the family.” A

And too many Pennsylvanians

' are unaware that this state has its

own Equal Rights Amendment,
mirroring the propsed national
amendment.

groups as Women’s Equity Action
League, Pennsylvania for Women’s
Rights and many smaller feminist
organizations fought for the
amendment which passed in 1971.

NOW member Nancy Epperson,
a Pitt undergraduate, feels that
while traditional obstacles to civil
rights enforcement, like rising
court costs and fear of employer
harassment, are holding back the
full force of Pennsylvania’s ERA,
general public ignorance and
apathy are the real problems.

People follow a “don‘t-make-
noise” philosophy, rationalizing
that discrimination isn’t “hurting
me much,” she says.

Kathy Fein of the Human
Relations Commission would per-
haps see this a symptom of a larger
phenomenon.

Women are prejudiced against
themselves--against their own cap-
abilities and potential, she Stres-
sed. Thus many women have
internalized their ‘oppression’ to a
point where they don’t think in
terms of having a career as they
grow up, never ordering their lives
toward any goal. l

Hunt Stained Glass

Stained Glass By Parrendo

proposes a design for their
approval before finalizing the
contract.

While home-installed windows
often revolve around the theme of
family, many commercial windows
are merely abstract color composi-
tions.

“It’s greatly symbolic and Very
abstract,” says the artisan of his
own work,
contemporaries. “I think artistry
has improved because we are now
talking to our own generation.

“You’re putting your energy out
for one particular person.
Enthusiasm has to do with the
challenge of sharing your work with
someone else. Every jog to me is a
personal experience.” ‘

Parrendo was apprenticed to
in 1950.
During his 25 years at Hunt,
employes and original owners have
retired or died, so that now a
half-dozen men handle the busi-
ness.

Hunt’s business volume suits its
number of employes. “We more or
less consolidated,” commented
Parrendo. Now the company does
a little sculpture and mural work to
accompany its main function of
stained glass artistry.

After acquiring a contract,
Parrendo makes a series of
drawings and paintings and ﬁnally
a full-size “cartoon,” or scale
design. From the cartoon
numbered pieces of paper are cut
to the intended size of glass pieces.

Once the glass pieces are cut to
size and waxed to a glass sheet,
Parrendo brushes pigment onto the
composition, which is then fired at
1,200 degrees. Finally, the window
is leaded and cemented for
waterprooﬁng.

Non-leaded, epoxy-bound glass
compositions consist of inch-thick
faceted dalles that are cut
according to the cartoon and laid in
a form. Resin is -then poured

and that of his

around, the glass. No leading or
painting is done in epoxy-bound
works.

The focus of stained glass art has
changed from illustrative narrative‘
to pure symbolism. _

Glass windows in early churches
served as Bible “storybooks” for
the illiterate, but now the artisans"
attention is closer to purely arti_stic.

Parrendo considers 12th and
13th century stained glass‘ the
ﬁnest. After that time, hesays,
artists began using too much
pigment and shutout too much

light in their works.

“The 20th century has. been the
upswing of it,” Parrendo main-

tained. “They rely less and less on
pigment.”

The ' origin of stained. glass is
unsure. Parrendo comments,
“There are legends about pirates
discovering glass on the sand after
their ﬁres had cooled. There are
legends that early glassmakers
would kill each other for the
formulas, and then there’s a story
about a monk in England. He was
called away from his work and a
button fell from his robe" onto
melting glass. When he came back
he found the glass had turned gold.

Sometimes, after Parrendo is;
done with it, the glass is worth
more.

Faculty Unionization:
An Analysis      

(Continued from Page II)

This is generally known as a
“determination of the bargaining
unit,” defining very carefully these
faculty who will or will not vote as
to whether a union will come to
power on campus.

The hearings have closed re-
cently, ‘after 40 days of testimony,
and the various lawyers will submit
their briefs on September '15 to the
Labor Board, which will then
decide what faculty may vote on the
union question.

The composition of the bargain-
ing unit is very important to unions
because a solidarity of view among
the union members will lend a
union greater power than a union
divided on important issues.

WHERE THE STUDENT COMES
lN

Earlier in this article a University
official was paraphrased as saying
students had not been mentioned
in the course of 40 days of
testimony about faculty unioniza-
tion at Pitt ,in the last year.

It seems the student question is
not of central concern to either the
University or the faculty in the
great debate of faculty unioniza-
tion. _ "

With issues as important to
student welfare as class size and
academic requirements in a posi-
tion to be negotiated at
bargaining table, there is no legal
provision for student participation.

According to a representative of
the Pennsylvania Labor Board,
students are not legally permitted
to participate in union-administra-
tion talks since they do not
comprise “a concerned party.”

At the University of Massachu-
setts, some students are replying to
the question not by attempting to
defeat faculty unionization, but by
unionizing themselves.

If money and power are the roots
of the union system, and if these
are the terms of ‘the bargaining
table at Pitt, a union of students
may be one of the ways in which
students may accumulate money
and power. ‘

If everyone else on the block has
an atom bomb, it doesn't hurt to
have one yourself.

NEWS ROUNDUP

(Continued from Page 6)

State Senator Frank Mazzei was
expelled from office following a
47-0 vote against him by his
colleagues. The action marked the
ﬁrst time in Pennsylvania history
that a legislator was removed by
the Senate.

The 62-year-old South Side
Democrat and member of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees has failed in his
fight against the expulsion, but his
position on the Board of Trustees
has remained in question since the
ouster.

The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences’ [FAS] decision over the
appointment of a chairperson for
the Slavic Studies Department was
met with disapproval and threats of
retaliation by an area Slavic leader
who termed the choice a “slap in
the face to the whole Slavic
community. ’ ’

City Councilman Robert R. Stone
charged Pitt with selecting an

‘inferior and unqualified candidate

in Dr. Jane Harris.

Stone warned of possible politi-
cal pressure to be brought against
the University as a result of the
move, but so far no retaliation has
been evident.

The University Senate voted to
enlarge the Senate Council by one
seat for representation by SGS,
bringing the total number of
students on the Council to nine.

About 30 supporters of the PPU
rallied on the Cathedral lawn to
protest the exclusion of graduate
student "teaching employees from
next year's announced salary
increase. The union demanded
that Pitt’s graduate employees--
TAs, TFs and RAs--receive a
$1,000-a-year wage increase to
counter the increase in the cost of

remainder of his tenure. Tarnock
ofﬁcially chose the latter option.

The SGB announced plans to
study a permanent ‘method of
remuneration to Board members.

Board members had complained
of inadequate reward and lack of
funds due to their election to serve
as student leaders earlier, thus
receiving temporary summer re-
imbursement of $450 each and $900
for SGB president Larry Platt.

New plans for remuneration
include a permanent ﬁxed schedule
of monetary compensation for
Board members throughout the
school year.

Pitt’s 1975-1976 budget came in
early for the second year in a row to
the tune of an $58.27 million
allocation from the state legisla-
ture. In previous years, the
funding has come in as late as
October. '

‘Equality of Rights   
Shall not beAbridged ’ 

(Continued from Page 14)_

“Women have for hundreds of
years been shafted,” says Fein,
“It’s very difficult for a society to
change fundamentally. If you are
going to equalize women you have
to be prepared to ‘see changes in
the institution of marriage, child
rearing practices, employment
practices and the division of labor
and resources--in every aspect of
society. And that's no fun. It’s

,_ hard. It’s hard for people who have

subconscious prejudices. And
those who hold power don’t give it
up easily.” _ _

In. her job with the Human
Relations Commission, Fein sees
the ERA as a legislative lever,
“providing a means to go after
practices, customs and laws in a
generalized fashion.”

What a national constitutional
ERA would do, where it would be a
force for change, and what it would
not do are questions often fogged
by confusion.

Today some women fear the loss
of what few protective social and
economic ‘ sanctions they have
should the ERA be passed. Child

’ vsupport upon divorce and protec-

tive employment legislation are
prime examples.

But many feminists claim that at
least in the area of domestic law
such court interpretations would
not necessarily follow, and that
instead of such decisions being
based on gender they would be
based on financial ability "and
child-rearing talent.

And Maurine Greenwald, of
Pitt’s History Department, sup-

ports the position of one-feminist " ‘ 

workers’ organization that protec-
tive legislation “that is meaningful
in the context of the workplace”

should. be extended to men--in 
addition to pushing for the ERA. - ,' 1 1
“Those who think the ERA will

 

win women equality are (wrong,-”_.  
says Greenwald. “Most see it as a  -
legal precondition for change. This I . -

does not mean power relationships .
within the family will change. In .

terms on employment, an economy; -’ 
that cannot support full employ- »

ment for men cannot support the
same for women.” . .

Greenwald predicts an increase
in job competition as well as
male-female tension as women
begin to win their place in the
workforce. . V

“The ERA has a potential for
intra-class conﬂict. I don’t want to
conclude, therefore, we‘shouldn’t
work for the ERA,” she sayd. -

For Greenwald the political
education of both men and women
under the ERA toward the “larger
struggle” is the priority. “Our

society is one of varying degrees of ~

inequality. We should work for a
transformation to a society where
people can ﬁnd the work they need.
The men who do a knee jerk when
told of women entering their
workplace need to be told‘ women
can be partners in the larger
struggle.”

And like so many others she
concludes: “I hope the ERA will be
passed, but I have no illusions
about the varying effects it will
have.”

Organizational Structure

THE BOOK CENTER is a departmental operation. Merchandise or
services offered are catagorized into -four given areas or departments.
These are textbooks, new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All
buying for these areas is premised on three basic principles. First the
item must be required for a given course or program of the University.
Items of this type are naturally the textbooks, used books, and paper-
backs. Second, trade department items are made available that are
necessary to supplement and complement the course study and to en-
hance the cultural and academic significance of the University. Third,
supply department on the lower ﬂoor has supply items for your every
need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hundreds of other items.
Fourth, sundries department has all the professional items, engineering
supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the availability of
many items extremely professional. '

What ever happened to come-
dies? .

You know--funny, ha-ha movies.
Maybe it’s the power of hindsight
and history speaking, but they
don’t make ’em like they used to.
Today’s comedies are certainly
long on technical know-how, and
pretty bloody short on the laughs.

Take Mike Nichols’ latest com-
edic' venture, The Fortune, filled

_with dazzling camera movement

and highly appreciable attention to
detail. Okay. We’re dazzled by his
camera work and highly appreciate
his attention to detail. But when do
we get to laugh?

Not very often. And very
possibly for the reasons just stated.
They tend to detract from what
could have been a wild, reckless

comedy. The Fortune is too
constrained, overdwelling on real-
 ity to the detriment of the

necessary web of fantasy/
surrealism necessary to construct
comedy.

The movie stars Jack Nicholson
and Warren Beatty (with their
names arranged in that cute
diagonal form so you’re not really
sure on who’s getting top billing),
but their acting seems closer to
affectation than performance. It’s

just a little too tight, a little too

concerned with minute detail.

There are moments, to be sure:
like Beatty’s constant devotion to
the nearest mirror; Nicholson’s
slovenly sexual prowess.

But both take a back seat to
third-billed Stockard Channing (no
relation to Carol), who most‘-
definitely steals the, show. She

The heat of the evening summer
rain was lifting as the wetness
dribbled from the streetlights. The
back of our collar curled around

your humid hair and the rain
running in the gutters gurgled
beside your sneakers. It was a
night for, death and a night for gang
life. It was a night to remember.

The kids were off the streets
under their covers while mom and
dad sat watching TV downstairs.
We were outside down by the gas
station sitting on the hoods of cars
drinking beer that was_really too
warm to drink but what did. we
care, because there was always
more and a litle warm beer never
hurt anybody.

The hoods of the cars were slick
with polish and hard work done in
the driveway of your forever young

seems to glide through the movie
not caring what else is going on.
She’s a welcome throwback to the
dotty heiress-heroines of the 208
and 30s--spoiled, presumptive, and
only on occasion stepping down to
reality.

It’s hard to tell whether she looks
so terriﬁc because the movie is so
bad, or if she makesvthe movie look
poor by her richer comparison. To
be fair, it is somewhere in between,
perhaps closer to the latter. The
few genuine laughs are the ones
she provides, and the scenes
without her are pretty dull.

The plot (such as it is--as though
plots in comedies were ever
important) concerns the efforts of

Beatty to beat the Mann Act with
the help of Nicholson. The Mann
Act, by the way, is’ the one
prohibiting the transporting of
women across state lines for
immoral purposes. That should
provide a few laughs in itself.
The scheme eventually turns. to
thoughts of murdering the young
heiress for the fortune she has
forsaken by going off with these
two bozos. The main part of the
ﬁlm, then, concerns the murder
plots and attempts. Attempts at
humor, too, with as much success.

On Being Funny: Woody Allen
and Comedy, Eric Lax, Charter-
house, $8.95, 243 pages.

Without Feathers, Woody Allen,
Random House, $7.95, 211 pages.

Twenty-eight years ago, Alan
Stewart Konigsberg was nothing
but a freckle-faced 12-year-old who
couldn’t joke his way out of a paper
bag.

Today that red-headed kid is
better known as Woody Allen, a
man frequently compared to the
masters of film comedy--Chaplin,
Fields, Marx.

He is a very successful man,
evidenced by the fact he has had a
book written about him and has
written two himself.

The book about is On Being
Funny: Woody Allen and Comedy.

The latest book by is Without
Feathers.

In the authorized Allen bio-
graphy, author Lax explains a lot
about the drive behind Allen’s
work. ' ‘

BY FELICE NEWMAN

I‘ Loveroot, Erica Jong, Holt, Rine-
hart and Winston, $4.95, 114

pages.

Erica Jong’s latest volume is a
sadly disappointing collection of
some good pointed previously
published poems and altogether
too many that simply do not make
it.

In this latest volume, Loveroot, it
seems we’ve caught Jong at her
worst.

The sexual humor that sold her
widely read novel, Fear of Flying,
and delighted poetry readers in her
ﬁrst book of poetry, Fruits and
Vegetables, has become trite
dribble and base inneundos in
Loveroot.

And her talent for turning the
phrase, for pointed metaphors,
seems watered down,‘ seems to
have given way to the overly
simple, vulgar and commercialized
strains of her writing.

This dichotomy in Jong’s writing
is clearly exhibited even within
Loveroot. A curious coincidence,
noting Jong’s “progress” as a

from meek, and far from the level
of helplessness his ‘character
exhibits. He is the boss on the set
of his films, and he, Mr. Allen,
commands much respect.

Lax shows this well. He writes

Jong Misses Depth in

New ‘Loveroot' Poems

poet, is found when one realizes
that the energetic poems, those
that don’t waste words or depend
on tired associations to work, have
been previously published. ‘
“Sylvia Plath is Alive in
Argentina” was published in the
Massachusetts Review as well as
an anthology edited by ‘Ed
Ochester, Natives. Thus the poem
is one of the earliest in the book.

Taking advantage of the post-‘

World War II rumors of Hitler’s
escape as well as the mysteries
surrounding Plath’s‘ own suicidal
motives, Jong creates “A regular
girls’ dormitory down 'there...the
crazy ladies having the last laugh.”

Jong carries off the absurdity,
with Plath’s roommates being
literary figures like Diane Arbus
and Zelda Sayre, complete with
images of orgies with the Marquis
and Hitler himself as the “daddy
we never ha .”

More important, the story line of
this poem works. The sarcasm is to
the point and the writing is quality.

Compare this to a poem that hits

just unnecessary--the book is what

.a biography should be--heavy on

the fact and light on the fluff.

Considerably better, though, and
less scholarly, is Allen’s own ﬂing
at the typewriter.

Without Feathers is the funniest
new book anybody will read for a
long time.

Blending Benchley and Perel-
man into his own unique style,
Allen proves himself a true

"humorist, as opposed to just a

comedian.
The book is funny. Like his
movies and plays, the essays are a

, series of short jokes, one a bit

funnier than the other, all bound
together with some unlikely prem-
ise.

For example, in “A Guide to
Lesser Ballets,” Allen, describing
the scene of a wedding, writes"
“Meanwhile, Wolfschmidt, on
Sigmund’s behalf, has found the
missing Yvette--not a difficult‘ task,
he explains, ‘because how many
half-women, half-swans are there
hanging around Hamberg?

“Despite Justine’s imploring,
Sigmund rushes off to Yvette.
Justine runs after him and kisses
him, ‘as the orchestra strikes a
minor chord and we realize
Sigmund has his leotards on inside
out. Yvette weeps, explaining that
the only way to lift the spell is for
her to die. In one of the most
moving and beautiful passages in
any ballet, she runs headlong into a
brick wall. Sigmund watches her
body change from a dead swan to a
dead woman and realizes how
bittersweet life can be, particularly
for fowl. Grief-stricken, he decides
to join her, and after a delicate
dance of mourning, he swallows a
barbell.”

A good example of Allen’s wit
and unpredictability, but it is not
the book's best.

if there is a best, is is probably

the one-act play--“God (A Play)”--

Pitt Instructor

Heads Museum

Film Program

BY M. C. PILECKI

.4"\..

Going from an instructor of ﬁlm
to a museum curator is a step in the
right direction, but it does have its
problems.

William D. Judson, the recently
named curator of the film section of
the Carnegie Institute Museum of
Art, ﬁnds communication problems
he hadn't encountered as the
director of the University's ﬁlm
studies program.

BILL J UDSON

“As a teacher, you could get

instant feedback,” he noted. With"

the fine arts department since
1973, Judson pointed out that with
his students he had a “captive
audience,” and thus could explain
more about the techniques of film
and answer immediately any
questions.

That’s a luxury he won’t.have
when dealing with the public
showings of the museum's ﬁlm
section. One of the ways Judson
hopes to overcome this problem is
improved program notes,
giving the audience a bit more

-background on the ﬁlms shown,

and more of an awareness of the

visual impact and methods of ﬁlm. *
“I want to essentially make the -

reason for film clearer and more
accessible to the public,"

_Fv;.,worst--“The Poet Writes in I.”

There are a few nice phrases as
Jong tries to-explore the tradition
of solitude, of loneliness among
poets. She speaks of the
“metronome of pain” and the clock

striking on metal, images with a,

potential not developed here.’
But these few nice lines are not
enough to save the poem, where
theJartist is reduced to McK_uen-
esque:_ ‘ .‘*The poet writes in. I

because ‘she knows‘ no other

language...She‘ is aninlet.. ‘He is a
peninsula. They. is. a great
engulﬁng sea...”

If -.long is trying to reach the

._ common base of some sort of

an.

writers’ experience, by transcend-
ing gender and cultural ties...if she
has tries to go beyond these things
to reach the core of her pain, she

has failed, instead giving us a-

too-cute, not even clever rendition
of sexual geography. T

The trite and vulgar here has

won over her ability as a writer.
She seems to be relying on past
success (the sexual metaphors of
old) instead of pushing on to new
poems.

Too many poems in Loveroot
seem to be the faded negatives of
poems Jong could have written--it
certainly is within her talent as a
writer to do better than this.

Today, even so-called “non-technical” courses
(psych, soc, bus ad, to name 3) require a vari-
ety of technical calculations—complicated cal-
culations that become a whole lot easier when
you have a powerful pocket calculator.

Not surprisingly, there are quite a few such
calculators around, but ours stand apart, and
ahead. We started it all when we introduced the
world’s first scientific pocket calculator back in
1972, and we’ve shown the way ever since.

The calculators you see here are our newest,
the first of our second generation.Both offer you
technology you probably won’t find in compet-
itive calculators for some time to come, if ever.

Our HP-21 performs all arithmetic, log and
trig calculations, including rectangular/ polar
conversions and common antilog evaluations.

Pgh. Symphony Season
Spins a Musical Web

BY PAMELA EUSI

With prices soaring, unemployment running rampant, disaster
movies abounding, and cities declaring bankrupcy, things don’t seem

‘ to be looking up in the world. But if you're a symphony and/or opera

fan, things are a little brighter for you,Pittsburgh.

I don’t know if Bicentennial fever is striking or if Steinberg is trying
to go out with the hang of Beethoven’s ninth. Perhaps a combination of
the two. Even so, the music lovers of Pittsburgh can’t possibly be
unhappy with the program set this year. From tone poems and world

’ premieres to symphonies and concertos,the season offers something to

please the most staid music fan.

William Steinberg will conduct ten concerts in his last season as
music director for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. His standard
interpretation of German Romantic and Post Romantic music is
established and will serve him well in the opening concert September
-12. The compositions of Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner will be
featured.

For his other concerts Steinberg has chosen the music that made him
worldfamous. Included are Beethoven’s Symphonies Nos. 1 and 9,
Bruckner’s Symphony No. 4 and Schubert’s Unﬁnished Symphony No.
8.

It’s interesting to note that this year will mark the first time Byron’s
Manfred, composed by Robert Schumann, will be performed in its
entirety at Heinz Hall.

Featured soloists also help to guarantee a super season. Rudolf
Serkin, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Isaac Stern, Misha
Dichter, Alicia de Larrocha and Lynn Harrell are some of the names
scheduled to perform a number of superb and extremely difficult

-pieces.

Three world premieres and four Pittsburgh premieres are coming up
in contemporary American, French, German and English styles.
September 26-28 Steinberg will conduct an all-English program
featuring Miriam Fried as the guest violin soloist.

The Pittsburgh Chamber Orchestra, composed of prominent first
chair members of the Pittsburgh Symphony; has two concerts

V scheduled spotlighting Bernard Goldberg and Lorin Hollander as

soloists.

Not to be overshadowed by the symphony, the Pittsburgh Opera
offers Offenbach’s Tales of Hoffman, Bizet’s Carmen, Donizetti’s
Lucia di Lammermoor, Ward’s Thr Crucible, Puccini’s madama
Butterﬂy, and Verdi's A Masked Ball. The guest artists hail from New
York’s Metropolitan Opera Company and other leading opera
companies around the world. All performances will be conducted by
Richard Karp and will include the Pittsburgh Symphony and the .
Pittsburgh Opera Chorus. .

Now if the above has not already blown your heart and mind ,the
Pittsburgh Symphony Pops Concerts open with 81-year-old “Pops
King” Arthur Fiedler and continue with Melba Moore, Frankie Laine,
Cy Coleman, Ferrante and Teicher, and Jose Feliciano.

Even if you aren’t a symphony or opera aﬁcionado and just like
classical music, you must admit that this is quite a lineup for one
season. The difficulty of the pieces can only be surpassed by the
brilliancy of the artists in performance. It will be interesting to see
what the symphony can add to the standard pieces, what each

A individual conductor will bring out -in those works, and how well the

conductor and orchestra react with the temperaments of so many
different stars. .

Season Debut

New York’s got one. LA’s got
one. Even Minneapolis has one.

And ﬁnally Pittsburgh’s caught
the bug.

The city's first professional
residential theatre, the Pittsburgh

0

topped 6,000 and additional per-
formances are scheduled to accom-
odate this unexpected demand.
“Adding additional performances
will expose theatre to a greater
number of people then we
originally planned,” said General
Director Ben Shaktman.

“...Plays.that evoke an immediacy in action...”

Public, is riding hard on the heels

and subscriptions of numerous

other community groups.
Already, subscription sales have

“lt’s the community’s committ-
ment that will insure the public’s
survival,” he continued. “Espec-
ially that ofits youth.” '

taking any chances. One of the
innovative offerings (the “open
stage") introduces approximately
900 middle, junior and high school
students the live theatre--in lthe
making.

“Most kids are used to seeing art
in its finished, perfected form, like
movies and TV,” Director of
Resident Programs Edith Oliver
Rea said. “We aim to involve them
in the exciting process of arriving
at that finished product.”

During the final weeks of
rehearsal, you-ng people from
throughout the city may catch their
first glimpse of a lighting board
run-through or a curtain call
rehearsal--much of theatre’s
“spontaneous” activity.

‘But most of the spontaneity in
season has vanished. Careful
choosing of possible scripts was
first in order. “We turned into the
artistic pulse of each possibility,”
Shatkman said. “Our plays evoke
audience response in a kind of

_ immediacy in action. They not only

live in the cerebral, but also in the
soul.”
One way Shaktman bridged the

gap between head and heart is an ‘

open stage concept of scene
design. Scenic designer Peter
Wexler pointed to this flexible
framework as conducive with the

B1 D.UUG GEBHARD
Neil Young, “Tonight’s the
Night,” Reprise (MS222l)!!!!!
“It’s too dark to put the keys in
my ignition...”
Author's preface:
take something into consideration
about this album; the songs were
written within a two-year span
dating around late ’72 and early
'73. Most of them were performed
along with the Time Fades Away
material on the Stray Gators tour in

‘_ '73. At least one song has emerged

unsuspecting to Journey through
the Past movie viewers as the
credits’ music, and Stills has been
performing another for over a year.

Chronologically this album be-
longs _between Time Fades Away
and Human Highway (an un-
released one in the cans). This lp
wasn’t released until now because
it was put away and virtually
forgotten. At a party, he was
previewing a new lp, Home Grown.
Its
starkness and looseness gave it
positive points heretofore missed.

As has been said in Rolling
Stone, Neil has split from Carrie,
has split from his ranch for dune
buggie-ridden Topanga Canyon

and has ﬁnally gotten over Danny V

*********

One man’s music is another
man's poison. And -so it goes.
Many men have died with the truth
in their veins. Neil Young has been
living with the venom in his system
for two years now. In turn he has
killed us a hundred times over.
The mysterious mountain man
behind reﬂector sunglasses hasn't
let us see through the grey
background of clouded impression-
ist lyrics. With each album a new
hidden world is viewed. A
different dimension of a surreal
painting is put on top of another
coat of paint. It gets to a point
where the original signature is
covered over by layers of new
images.

"put out of business.,
 , Expecting nothing of Neil's new
"release, many folks have missed
- the most honest album Neil Young
could have released at this time.
Honesty _is the word to remember
when listening to this piece
because it takes not only a very
brave man, but an honest man, to
' put out this type of album. The
harmonies are off-key, somebody
screws up the words and the
playing is far from flawless. It is,
in his words, a very loose lp.
Tonight’s is" another side of
America. A side we all know now
even better than we did yesterday.
It is a story about ODs. ODs on
smack and on life. It is specifically
1 about the death of Danny Whitten,
ex-lead guitarist, vocalist, song-
writer of the Rockets and Crazy
Horse. Were he alive today, the
face of rock and roll would be
drastically altered. Credit had
never been given to him for his
playing and writing ability. Songs
such as ‘‘I Don't want to Talk
About It,” “Dirty, Dirty” and the

What You Do

  Our Business

Rockets’ “Hole in My Pocket” and
“Mr. Chips,” were forgotten. The
man could write. That was before.
Things got bad and Danny was
burned out before long. While he
was practicing for the Stray Gators
tour, Neil told him he couldn't cut
it. Though he pleaded, Danny was
dismissed. That same night Neil
received a phone call that informed
him Danny had OD’d. With that
under his belt, NY toured. He has
had that on his mind, boxed up and
ready to explode. .
Tonight’s spirit is that of
Whitten’s funk and fluidity rein-
carnated in Nils Lofgren...amply
ﬁlling his place. The album reeks
of death. It has dope smoke all
through it. Beer, tequila and love
ooze from the inner sleeve.
Whatever will get you high and lost
is present. The sad songs and the
pretty songs are here, with their
comrades of indulgence.

Bruce Berry was a C, S, N and Y
roadie who OD’d on horse. He’s

his feel for the "silver screen. It

“The play is fast in its change of
pace and mood. And our form
offers clues and elements of the
1930s homelife. But the audience
also must work.”

Wexler described the set as a ﬁre
escape brimming with moods,
atmosphere and environment.

Any problems so far?

“About thirty thousand of ’em,”
Wexler mused. “We chose seven
trainees to participate in the
training program but it’s too soon
to judge if all is going well.”

‘ Wexler stressed the importance of

such on-the-job training.
“There’s an obligation within

the theatre to pass on information

and technical know-how to its

, young,” he said. “Any group art,

Er

 

be it music, ballet...even architec-
ture has that responsibility.”

It appears that other Public
Theatre staff members feel similar
obligations. Rea designed the
trainee program for those seeking
vocational rather than academic
experience. “This alternative
provides opportunities to both the
young and old, even I for the
disadvantaged with little theatrical
background,” she stated.

But there isn’t a “lack of
theatrical background” in the
tightly woven cast of Tennessee
Williams’ immortal characters‘.

explained. “On a long-range, I
want to make clear the connection
between ﬁlms and what we think of
as movies, that is, the feature-
length commercial ventures.”

One of the ways he plans to go
into this, he says, is by delving into
the relationships between different
artistic media. “I’d like to set up a
mini-screening and exhibition
series,” he continued, “to.estab-
lish the connection between, for
example, the painters of the
twenties and the filmmakers of the
twenties.”

Judson takes over the curator-
ship from the hands of Sally Dixon,
who started the ﬁlm section in 1970
and built it up to a center of ﬁlm
internationally respected.

“I think the reputation has been
established largely by the sound-
ness of her programing,” Judson
said. “That is largely an issue of
quality--getting ﬁlms of interest for
cultural and social reasons.” The
programing for the fall and winter
was done by Dixon before she left
the museum, and Judson says
there will be no immediate changes
in that area. He plans to continue
the public showings, noting “the
program will obviously reﬂect
different tastes and interests.”

The public screening program

series. The ﬁrst includes Eisen-
stein and Bresson (both scheduled
by Sally Dixon) for the upcoming
season, and, as is custom, will
include guest speakers in at some
point in the series to speak of the
directors’ works.

The last, the independent series,
brings in the ﬁlm artist personally
to speak of his or her work. Judson
mentioned the possible inter-
changeability of the two programs,
explaining that an already estab-
lished artist could come in on either
of the two programs. “He could be
a guest speaker on a retrospective
of his own ﬁlms,” Judson pointed
out, “or}an independent ﬁlmmaker
in to show his ﬁlms. It does make a
difference . ’ ’

Judson was discussing the
possibility of bringing in film
artists whose work is still in
commercial release, such as
Antonioni. “But the cost could be
prohibitive,” he noted.

As to the other regular part of
the public showings, the history of
ﬁlm, Judson said that could also
come up for some changes. He
noted that he would never show a

want it, and added that Dixon
would never program on that basis,
But it may go into the
history of ﬁlms on an international
basis, and not conﬁne itself to
English-speaking ﬁlms, he said.

Part of the reputation of the
museum’s ﬁlm section also has
been built on the support it
provided to make‘ Pittsburgh an
important ﬁlm city. Judson said
that any role the museum would
take .“would almost have to be an
active one.”

He went on: The museum has
been supportive of film artists
working in Pittsburgh, and we want

to build up our collection of.

independent ﬁlmmakers.” He
added that, while the museum
hopes to build up its collection of
independently made films, and to
support ﬁlmmakers working local-
ly, it will not make the Pittsburgh
films the basis of the collection.

‘Part of the museum’s encoura-.

- gent of the local ﬁlm scene has

been the annual May ‘Day
celebration, an open festival for‘
local filmmakers. “I don’t know
what to do with it just yet,” Judson
commented. “I like the idea very

much of people all over Pittsburgh V

bringing in their ﬁlms. It’s kind of
fun, and once in a while an
extraordinarily good film comes
up.” He added that, in case the
event ever became so popular that
the calendar was glutted, a
screening program might have to
be instituted. “But it works better
as an open event,” he noted.
Besides being with the Univer-
sity’s ﬁne arts department--and
still teaching one class here--
Judson is a founding member and
current president of the Regional
Film Council of Pittsburgh, which
is designed to coordinate noncom-
mercial ﬁlm activities in the area:

repository of ﬁlms for use by
students and by the public. ‘

    Bulldogs Ilosi P

BY JIM SPANOS

Establishing a football team with
a powerful offense is like getting a
romance started with a pretty girl.
The timing has to be right as you
gradually try to build your
confidence.

That’s just what coaches Vince
Dooley of Georgia and Johnny
Majors of Pitt have done in the past
few years. Offense is what
tomorrow’s game will be about as
Pitt and Georgia renew their
incipient rivalry. The last time the
two teams played was in 1973 when

thev reached a 7-7 tie. _ ,
Georgia is similar to Pitt in that

- it has proven itself offensively. The
‘Bulldogs scored more touchdowns

(41) in the Southeastern Confer-
ence (SEC) last year than any other
team and Dooley is confident the
offense will have another good
year.

“We should have a very good
offense this year," Dooley says.
“We run from the veer and it’s
very exciting to watch." Our players
really enjoy ~it. Our quarterback
(Matt Robinson) is throwing the

ball very well, so offense is a strong 5

point."

Robinson is an exceptional
quarterback, adept at running the
option out of the veer. In his
sophomore season last year, he led
the SEC in passing with 1317 years,
throwing to a variety of receivers.

First among those was Rich
Appleby, a 210-pound tight end
who caught 23 passes for 510 yards
for Dooley last year. Appleby has
the potential to have another good
year in 1975.

The speed demons of America
are well represented at Georgia by
wide receiver Gene Washington, a
5-10 junior who poses a deep
threat. He also returns kicks.

Georgia also is wellrepresented
at running back, its best being
Glynn Harrison, who gained 959
yards rushing last year, third in the
SEC.

To clear the way for Harrison,
the Bulldogs have an offensive line
spearheaded by guard Randy
Johnson, a pre-season All-
American pick. Johnson weighs a
solid 253 pounds and is ﬂanked on
the left side by tackle Mike Wilson
(65, 260) —

While Georgia’s offense is in
very good shape, its defense is very
uncertain.

“We had seven seniors on our
defense who we lost through
graduation," Dooley said, “and I
think that was a blessing. Our
prospects for this year on defense
are not very good; though in fact it
looks very discouraging.”

The Bulldog defense was the
worst in the SEC last year and in
large part was responsible for a
mediocre 6-5 season. Dooley
undertook a complete rebuilding
job this year, and, just how well he
has succeeded won’t be known
until tomorrow afternoon.

Back from last year’s defense are
end Rusty Russell, linebacker
Sylvester Bolcr and safety David
Schwak. They will be largely
responsible for containing Bob
Haygood, Tony Dorsett and the
rest of the Panthers.

In 1973, the Panthers practiced
all spring with the four-man front,
for which Dooley had sufficiently
prepared. Then, during fall camp,
Majors initiated the five-man
defensive line with Gary Burley at
noseguard; Georgia never recover-
ed from the surprise. That bit of
strategy was a very important
factor in determining the outcome
of the game. This time, Dooley is

ls the First Game
Really So Important?

BY RICK STOUFFER
SPORTS EDITOR

' Just how important is tomor-
row’s contest with Georgia at
Athens? Depending on who you
talk to the range of thought goes
from “just another game” to the
“crucial? game of the season.
game of the season.
However‘ one looks at the
situation this game will be a test for

Head Coach Johnny .Majors. With '

‘his records over the past two years
of 6-4-1 and 7-4, a lot of people
have come to expect a lot from the
former tailback from_ Tennessee,
Even Majors admits the program
shouldn’t be where it’s at this
early. The remarkable turnabout in
two short seasons borders on the
fantastic. So it will be a season to
see if Majors can keep up and
improve his winning ways. I
From another standpoint it is a

‘crucial game for Majors and his

staff because of a little thing
known_ as the veer offense.

“We’ve been studying the veer.
for over three years to see just what
it can do,” admits Majors. In his
three years as the Panther head
man he has ﬁnally found the
perfect combination of quarter-
back, runners and receivers that
can indeed handle the veer and the
intricacies that go with it.

For one thing, he needs a
quaterback who can run" like a
halfback, has the smarts to make
split-second decisions as to when to
give up and to whom to pitch the
ball, plus the ability to drop back
and fire the pass if need be. In
other words, he needs a total
leader. /

Majors has two in Bobby
Haygood and Matt Cavanaugh.

The veer also requires a speedy
backﬁeld, not hulking huge block-
ers but men who can glide and
maneuver into the open ﬁeld where
they are the most dangerous and
explosive.‘ Bobby Hutton or Elliott
Walker ﬁll the bill and Tony

Dorsett is...well, sufﬁce to say he’s
Tony Dorsett.

Receivers also make the veer
work in case the running game
breaks down. Good passing from
the veer is a very quick way to blow
a tight game wide. open. Once
again the Panthers of 1975 are
loaded with talent in this crucial
spot. Karl Farmer and Rodney
Clark have the experience while
Willie Taylor and Gordon Jones are
able underclassmen. V

But maybe, just maybe this
game will be most crucial to the
guys busting their backsides every
week--the players. A first game
win could set the tone for the rest of
the season.Whenever this year’s
schedule was made, it was ﬁgured
Pitt would never have another
respectable football team. So
because the gate [money] is split,
teams were scheduled who were
powers then and most likely would
be in later years.

The brains were half-right. The
powers then (Penn State, Notre
Dame, Oklahoma) still are highly
ranked, but this year Pitt too has a
chance at a winning season.

Regardless of schedule tough-
ness the pressure is definitely on
this squad to excel. Not only is it
counted on to out-perform the
previous two years but it begins not
knowing where it stands. The
squad doesn’t know how good it
can be.

Georgia is the test. If Pitt beats

’Georgia it “can at least beat an

average football team,”,accordlng
to Majors.

Looking at this game from all
angles, the Georgia game is
definitely a crucial one--sad in a
way because it happens to be the
first game of the season.

How will it turn out? It should be
a high scoring offensive battlefof
the veers with “the Burgh’s”
Panthers coming out on top. '

Johnny Majors ' can’t seem to
have his cake and eat it, too. The
offensive line might be the biggest
the Panthers have ever ﬁelded but

1 the defensive line will be one of the

smallest. .

The loss of Gary Burley [6-3,
250]--regardless of how well he
played--would be a blow to any
coach. Burley is now ﬁlling and
solidifying the line with the
Cincinnati Bengals in the National
Football League.

Burley wasn’t the only loss the
Panthers suffered. Three-year
letterman Mike Bulino (15 tackles,
12 assists, one interception) and
Kelcy Daviston (68 tackles, 62
assists, one interception) won’t be
around to push halfbacks" faces

' into the turf or knock receivers off

their course from their line backing
positions. ’

On paper.the defensive backfield
looks as depleted as Richard
Nixon's pocketbook. A 50% cut
isn't healthy, especially when the
losses were David Spates (22
tackles and 20 assists). and Glen
Hodge (47 tackles and 28 assists).

If you think Majors will be crying
all season, you are badly in error..
The defense won’t overpower the
opposing offensive lines but it “will
be a scrappy (defense that pulls
together and doesn’t wait for the
one player to make them all look
good,” according to senior safety
Dennis Moorhead.

At the left end position, Randy"

Cozens (6-4, 225) is the front
runner. Besides being the most

‘improved defensive‘ player in the

annual spring game and co-winner
of the first Ed Conway Memorial
Award, Cozens was impressive in
fall drills at Johnstown.

Don Parrish is a happy football
player. No matter what the
situation at Johnstown, he was the
one person wearing a big grin. He
is considered the strongest player
on the roster; many backs will
agree when he moves in “happily”
from his left tackle position.

Parrish as a fresh showed he was
a starter-to-be when he made 48
tackles in nine games. Last year he
ranked fourth for the season with
37 individuals and 41 assists to his
credit.

Keep on smiling. .

Burley isn't around as a middle
guard but Al Romano is his heir
apparent. Although not quite as
heavy as Burley, Romano is
considered by defensive line Coach
Jim Dyar as almost as fast as
Burley. -

Perhaps a bit slower», Romano is
the thinking man’s ball player and
uses his extra smarts in getting to
the ball.

      Defense Small, Scrappy

Randy Holloway (right tackle)
was called by Majors after fall
camp one of the most improved
players in the entire camp. He’s
6-6 and 225 pounds, so no one is
about to argue with this giant.

Outstanding in high school
basketball, Holloway uses his great
height and reach to both bat down
passes and push offensive linemen
away like so many toys on the ﬁeld.
A quiet guy at all times, he lets his
playing to the talking.

Ed Wilamowski went to fall camp
as one of ﬁve defensive ends who
lettered on last year’s team. He
knew he’d have to work hard to
come up with a starting position.
As it turned out, the job was
his with only a dash of pain.

Big Ed had an excellent
freshman year at end but last year
was nagged by minor injuries that
added up to one dismal season.
Majors is hoping the little aches
and pains leave Wilamowski alone
this season.

As a sophomore last year,
linebacker Arnie Weatherington
ranked third in tackles with 129,
behind Daviston and Burley. The

4:

Panthers will look to him this year
to deliver even more than before.
Considered one of the best tacklers

on the s uad, Weatherington '
proved mi way through his fresh-_ ‘

man year that he could handle

tough assignments and this year, V A
should prove to be the biggest test‘ ‘

yet. .
Tom Perko was

surprise to Majors. Although he

had played defensive end his ﬁrst "

three years at Pitt and had lettered
in all three, his switch to linebacker
was a move the coaching staff
niade hesitantly. . .
‘ “Perk” took it in stride and has

become a first string backer-of-the-. I '

line. With his great size, Perko
definitely should bolster the
linebacking corps while providing

badl-y needed leadership on the I

defensive team.

, Larry Felton is a monster. Now ’
don't lock your doors and bolt‘ your c
windows, because Felton plays‘-

the monster back position on
defense--sort of a cross between a
linebacker and a defensive back.

For 1975 Campaign
Boaters Prepare  

BY STEVE SYBERT

Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis is
not making jokes when he says the
Panther booters must score more
goals than their opponents in order
to win. He really means it.

With eight veterans back from
last season’s 4-6-2 squad, Bemis
believes this year’s main objective
will be to build a potent offense to
get Pitt on the scoreboard.

“We have to score a lot more
goals this year in order to have a
successful campaign. With 15
games on our schedule, l,’d say
we’d have to score in excess of 30
goals to have a winning season.”

Bemis, in his twenty-second year
at the reins of the Pitt soccer
program, is counting on his
returnees to generate that offen-
sive power.' Senior‘striker Allen
Jutca will lead the offensive line,
with the -experience of Andy
Behrend, John Morahan and John
Curley right with him.

Kim Blasko will anchor the
mid-defense aided by halfback Tom
Murphy and, with fullback Ernie
Gross, try to provide. adequate
protection in front of returning
goalies Frank Bucci and Fred
Dohrmann. .

The Panthers finished fourth in

“We feel we have a good team,

but we're young and untested and
have to prove our ability to score.

The team is in good spirits and‘

everybody works hard out there.”

Pitt’s tough schedule will un-
doubtedly be the true test. With

Bemis ‘isn't about to throw in the

er JIM SPANOS

In 1973, Pitt set a school
record fortotal offensive yardage in
 ‘ one season. Of course, that was
 Johnny Major's first year as head
 coach, and the Panthers startled
7 everyone by gaining 3,805 yards for
the year, en route to a 6-4-1 record.
  The success of the Cats in 1975
 might just depend on whether or
;_ “not they can gain more yardage
” - than they did two years ago.

' The potential for perfection is
certainly at hand. And when you

. speak of perfection, you’ve got to
. L start‘ with the backfield. At

I quarterback, Majors has two
potentially "ﬁne men. Robert
Haygood, the man who will start

 

I‘ against Georgia tomorrow, isavery .
, Tony Dorsett to kick around any

quick runner.
Majors and his staff converted
the offense from the I-formation to
the veer during spring drills, and a
speedy, intelligent quarterback is
needed if the veer is to work
effectively. Finesse and speed
 ‘ rather than brute force are required‘
 in the veer, and Haygood and his
 I backfield’ certainly will provide it.

- Backing up Haygood is sopho-
more ' quarterback Matt Cava-
naugh, who has even less
experience that Haygood as signal
caller. Cavanaugh is a more
impressive thrower than Haygood,
and if the situation should call for
this arm, he’ll certainly be
summoned.

In a word, the Pitt backfield is

awesome. Tony Dorsett, Bobby
Hutton, and Elliott Walker will
contribute considerably to the
Panther attack. Dorsett will start at
tailback, and either Hutton or
Walker at fullback.

The list of Dorsett’s accomplish-
ments achieved in two years at
tailback is longer than Jimmy
Durante’s nose. An All-American
as a freshman, “The Hawk” has
gained nearly 2,700 yards thus far,
209 of which came against Notre
Dame in 1973 (the most yardage
ever gained _by one runner in one
game against the Irish). Dorsett
came to fall camp in excellent
condition and is ready to make a
spirited run for the coveted
Heisman Trophy.

But Pitt’s opponents won’t have-

more. The veer should enable
either Hutton or Walker to carry
the ball much more than the
fullback did when the Panthers
used the I-formation.

Walker-gained instant notoriety
last year. The first time he touched
the ball he juked his way to an
80-yard run. That was against
North Carolina. Then, with Dorsett
iniured against Temple, Walker
scored four touchdowns and
showed the world that, yes, Elliott
Walker is for real. He’s been
running neck-and-neck with Hutton
for the starting fullback position
and only his coach [Majors] knows
tor sure who will start against
Georgia.

Hutton filled in capably for the
injured Dave Janasek last year,
averaging 4.8 yards per carry. At

six feet and 190 pounds, Hutton _

adds some needed power to the
explosive Pitt backﬁeld.

Explosive also describes the
Panthers’ crop of receivers.
Seniors Karl Farmer and Rodney

Clark provide leadership at split '

end and ﬂanker, respectively.

Speedster Farmer’s main claim to
fame is as Pitt’s record holder in
the 440-yard dash, which he runs in

a cool 46.4 Coupled with his speed -

is the experience he gained last
year, in which he grabbed 18
passes for an average of 15.8 yards
per catch.

“Our passing game could be a
very competitive area on our
team,” says Majors. “We’ve come
along way with it, but only under
pressure-type situations will we be
able to tell how good we are.”

Rodney Clark has been in
pressure situations before. Clark,
also known as the “Pink Panther,”
has been clocked at 4.5 in the
40-yard dash and, along with
Farmer, contributes the speed so
vital to the passing attack.

Junior tight end Jim Corbett will '

have to be at his best if the
Panthers are to effectively chal-
len_ge Penn State as the best in the
East. Corbett snagged 16 passes
for 202 yards last year, and along
with his pass-catching ability, his
blocking talents are vital to the
team’s success. _

“I have to improve my block-
ing,” Corbett noted at the
Panther’s camp in serene Johns-
town. “‘We’re primarily going to
be a running team,” he added,
"‘and you’ve got to block if you
want to run.”

Equally impressive as those who
will start at receiver are those who
won’t. Willie Taylor, Randy
Reutershan, Gordon Jones and
Jinx Johnson all promise to

contribute. Taylor had an
extraordinary year as a freshman
and certainly will challenge Clark
for the starting job at ﬂanker.
Jones is a freshman blue-chipper
who drops a pass about as often as
the sun rises in the West, and
Reutershan and Johnson also are
very much in the thick of things.

INE years ago near Lexing-
ton, N.C., PPG Industries
converted a 150—acre farm
into a sleek new factory.

Today that factory employs more
than 1000 people and produces 140
million pounds of glass ﬁbers a year

I —for‘everything from draperies to

lightweight automobile body parts.

A ' 0 On Michigan's Escanaba River,
_g wood pulp is fed into one end of a

new Mead Corp. papermaking ma-
chine that almost ﬁlls a building a
quarter of a mile long. At the other
end gmerges a band of paper 25 feet
wide. Up to.600 workers harvest the
wood for this plant, while 1100 make
the paper—-;annually enough paper
to cover a 16-lane highway around
the earth at the equator. 2

0 At New Iohnsonville, Tenn.,
DuPont built a plant to produce ti-
tanium dioxide, the safe whitener

that has replaced lead in paint and‘

18 used in scores of other products
including paper and textiles. The
year it opened, the plant provided
jobs for more than 300 local resi-
dents. Now, nearly three times that
number are on the payrolls-—which
ran about $14 million last year.
These three factories are the result
of what economists call capital in-
vestrnent. Their cost adds up to a
huge sum—approximately $250 mil-
lion. Each was ﬁnanced with re-
tained earnings (the funds that in-
dustry has left after paying all the

costs of doing business, including.

taxes and dividends to stockholders),

or borrowed funds, or both.

Such capital investment is what
our forefathers called “thinking
ahead.” When we still lived on farms
or in villages, no one but a fool

I would consume all his garden, herds

and ﬂocks. A smart man kept some-
thing for breeding stock and seed.
But for some years now our coun-
try has lived as if this commonsense
wisdom applied to everybody except

us. Between 1960 and 1973 we rein- -

vested an average of 13.6 percent of
our real gross domestic product in
new plants and equipment, com-
pared with 18.2 percent in France,
20 percent in Germany and 29 per-
cent in Japan. '

Some 60 to 70 percent of our exist-
ing manufacturing capacity has been
installed since 1960, versus 85 percent
of Japan's. While our government

was increasing demand by incur—_

ring deﬁcits and voting new money
payments to our people, we ran
our old, less-efﬁcient factories above
their proper operating level. Nat-
urally, this caused costs and prices
to spiral.

If we are to pull out of this reces-
sion and avoid worse ones, we must
begin now to invest much more in
job—creating plants and equipment.
But how? Most economists believe
one solution lies in substantially in-
creasing the investment tax credit,
which allows‘an industry to deduct
from its federal income tax a per-
centage of the cost of new assets and
equipment (not including build-

ings). Congress recently raised the
credit from seven to ten percent. Re-
spected economist Pierre Rinfret be-
lieves that we should permanently
enact a 20-percent federal investment
tax credit. This would put us on a
par with most of our major foreign
industrial competitors.

More liberal depreciation‘ allow-
ances would also help. Present tax
laws assume useful lives for build-
ings and equipment during which
companies stretch out tax deductions
for their cost. But the assumed lives
often exceed the period of years
when the buildings and equipment
are truly competitive. Thus, business
frequently ﬁnds itself still trying to
recover original cost for buildings
and equipment which progress has
rendered obsolete.

To raise the level of capital invest-
ment and create jobs we must also
change popular attitudes. Too often
when a new factory or power plant
is proposed, our response has been
“Don’t put _it here.” Nobody can
quarrel with the need for informed
concern for the environment, but
nobody can quarrel, either, with the
need for jobs. Consider the exhila-
rating beneﬁts of capital investment
in that PPG Industries plant in Lex-
ington, N.C.: ’

0 Horace Hill, 36, was born on a
tobacco farm, had to quit school after
the ninth grade, spent three years in
the Air Force, got a low-paying mill
job. Then PPG hired him and

trained him to make and repair the .

$5000 platinum nozzles from which
the molten glass is spun. He now
heads a work force of ten.

0 Carolyn Blevins, now 25, was
working in the spraying department
of a furniture factory when she got
the chance to go to PPG as an “end
ﬁnder,” a highly skilled job which
involves ﬁnding thread ends which
are then twisted onto bobbins. “I've
worked lots of places where they let
a woman do a man's job—but they
don’t pay you for it,” she says. “At
PPG everybody’s treated the same.”

0 Charles Clark, also 25, the son
of a common laborer, is one of four
men who oversee PPG’s huge glass
furnaces. Eight years ago he was

Clark directs a staff of 40.

The beneﬁts from PPG are felt
elsewhere. Surrounding factories and
mills found they had to raise their
pay scales to compete. For a while,
labor was so scarce that Lexington
came close to zero unemployment.

According to U.S. Department of
Commerce ﬁgures, the $10 million
PPG paid last year in wages was
spent by employes approximately
like this: $1.8 million for food; $1.6

million for housing and household --

operation; $800,000 for clothing; $1.9
million for transportation, recreation

and education; $1.9imilli0n for taxes v

and Social Security; $600,000 for
medical care; $200,000 _for interest;
and $1.2 million for everything else,
including savings. 5

Beyond this, there’s a multiplier
effect that operates whenever a new

plant comes to town. By Bureau of-

Labor Statistics calculations, each

job in manufacturing makes possible

three other jobs. So when PPG’s
Lexington roster last year passed the
1000 mark, the employes were sup-
porting 3000 other workers, from
bus drivers to doctors.

Lexington can be proud of the new
PPG plant. The low, central red-
brick building, ﬂanked by blue and
white tent-like wings, is handsome
architecturally, and inside, no wom-

an keeps her kitchen looking nicer. ,
If the United States is to regain —

its pre-eminence in the highly com-
petitive industrial world and pro-
duce what we need with reasonably
full employment and stable prices,
thousands of new factories like'this
one will have to become solid life-
giving realities. Thus, it is vital that
we allow American industry to re-
cover the costs of new investment
much more rapidly than is now pos-
sible. Only then will industry have
the means to keep our economy pros-
perously expanding.

Collective Bargaining-New Possibilities

How Faculty and Staff Changed the
Rules for Access to Personnel Files

We give University personnel files little thought until they are reviewed for promotion and tenure decisions.
It is then that we realize the effect that an administrator's comment or a bit of officialgossip can have on
our career development. ‘

Faculty and professional staff at the Pennsylvania State College and University System decided that the

method of handling their personnel files was too important to be left in the hands of the Administration._

After they voted for collective bargaining through PSEA/NEA, they overhauled the whole personnel file
system. ' .

Pitt faculty and professional staff will negotiate‘ for a personnel file system designed for our particular needs

 

when collective bargaining begins here. For background, here is what they did atlthe Pennsylvania State

Colleges and Universities: - . ‘

ACCESS TO FlLES—All professionals have -the
right to see their personnel files at any time. No
reason or explanation has to be given. The right
to access is in the collective bargaining contract.

ANSWERING MATERIAL lN FILES’ ¥Under
the PSEA/NEA contract, faculty can answer or
add to any material that has been placed in their

files and have that response become a permanent, A

part of the record.

CONSOLIDATING THE FlLES—Prior to collec-
tive bargaining an individual often had several
files, one in the Personnel Office, one in the De-
partment Office and perhaps a file in the office
of one or more deans. Under the new system

_ there is only one employment file and one file
for pre-employment references which is confi-
dential. ‘

THE FILES ARE L|MlTED—Only material di-
rectly related to professional performance can
be put in the personnel files. Nothing regarding

personal life outside the University can be in—'
cluded. A member of the faculty or professional

" staff has the right ‘to enter a grievance to have

material which doesn't» meet the definition of
being related to professional performance re-
moved from his or her file.

FILES ARE CONFlDENT|AL—ln addition to

 - the faculty or professional staff member, only
 the college President or the President's designee

has access to personnel files. Anyone else must
obtain written permission from the faculty
memberto see the file. The same written per-

mission must also be given to tenure and promo— 0,

tion committees. '

THE CHOICE. IS OURS—'Personne| files is only
one area of University life in which collective
bargaining will give us an opportunity to make
major changes. !t is not too soon to start to
consider the positions we will want our elected
faculty and professional staff negotiating com-

mittee to take to the bargaining table. _

If one were to listen to Pitt's

he might be led to believe the Pitt
sports program abounds with more

there might not be QUITE that

many, the optimism exhibited by
these folks is well founded.
Leading the pack of All-Ameri-
can hopefuls are Panthers Carson

But, there are question marks

Majors said. “We have quality
seniors but we don’t have a lot of

difficult. I don't wantto cry about
it, but it's the toughest schedule

Haygood will start at quarter-

Bobby Hutton or Elliott Walker at
fullback. Majors plans to useﬁve

all indications, the Panthers will

Both players have well-established
credentials, as everyone knows.
Another Pitt athlete with All-
American credentials is Keith

season and his abundant talents
have pro scouts drooling over the
prospect of signing him to a
contract.

inexperience seems to come to
mind when one talks about the 1975

the potential is there to make it just

assists and one interception, he

will be the steadiness and-

invaluable experience he’ll give to
the other starters.

'Welcome- .  

 

BY RON SIEGEL

(Editor’s Note: The following story

is a comparison of first year camp
with Johnny Majors and differen-
ces in the 1975 camp by a former
Pitt News Sports Editor.)

Two weeks ago, Johnny Majors
and his staff opened their
Johnstown training camp, looking
to plug a few holes in the potent
Pitt Panthers. Two years ago, the
same coaching staff came to the
same training camp with 80 new
recruits, and no idea of what to
expect. ’

Built out of a forest, the
Johnstown campus of Pitt has
changed little in two years.
Majors’ practice sessions, though
have. undergone radical changes.
V Majors took over a squad of
losers in 1973, a team that won
once in eleven tries the year before.
He knew he had to change some
attitudes, and set out doing it.

Pride in Pitt football was the
objective, and Majors had his
squad constantly hustling and
shouting. When a player scored a

I touchdown, coaches literally forced

his teammates to congratulate him.

In 1975, this is no longer
necessary. Just being around the
squad gives a player a sense of
pride, and Majors doesn’t have to
utilize training camp time to instill
it. '

Two years ago, Tony Dorsett was
a freshman sensation, but not a
sure thing in Majors’ eyes. He
asked reporters not to play up
Dorsett, explaining he didn't want
too much pressure put on him.

Last week in Johnstown, Tony
Dorsett calmly prepared for his

' Wannstedt,

expected third straight All-
American season. His freshman
performance was so magniﬁcent
his 1,000-yard sophomore season
was labeled a disappointment by
some.

Majors needed leadership two
years ago (people to come to the
front, as he puts it), and they
emerged in the persons of Bill
Daniels, Ray Olsen and Dave
Wannstedt, among others.

As Majors begins his third
season at Pitt, he again is seeking
leadership. Daniels, Olsen and
as well as Kelcy
Daviston, will provide a form of it
as assistant coaches. The players
that come forward will see plenty of
playing time this fall.

The squad is more personalized,
and smaller than the ’73 Panthers,
and there are only about 30
newcomers. No longer do players
wear their names on their helmets,
so coaches know who they’re
talking to. -

Majors is experimenting with a

‘new defense (the 4-4), as he did

two years ago, but he’s not keeping
it a secret this time. .

Two years ago, Pitt opened
against Georgia, this year’s first
opponent, and Majors surprised
the Bulldogs with a “50” defense.
A trick like that only works once,
and it's well known this year that
Pitt has a veer offense, as well as a
variable defense.

The Panthers arrived in Athens,
Georgia two years ago as 17-point
underdogs, then proceeded to
battle the Bulldogs to a 7-7 tie. Pitt
may be 17 points better than, it was
at this stage two years ago, so look
for the Panthers to be slight

to Football Weekly’s freshman All- _

American team.

Pelusi begins his first year as the
Panthers’ starting center, replac-
ing Mike Carey in that position.
Pelusi, [6-2, 242] was named
co-winner of the first Ed Conway
Memorial Award, given to the most
improved player during Pitt’s
spring football drills. A junior out
Ohio, Pelusi
started against Florida State last
year.

If the offensive line is big and
strong, the kicking game is even
stronger.

Majors emphasizes the kicking
game more than most coaches,
clenching a ﬁst and squinting an
eye any time it is mentioned.

“There’s none better in the
country than Carson Long,” says
Majors. Long, the placekicker, is a
junior this year and is being billed
by the sports information ofﬁce as
an All-American candidate; he’s

already set four all-time Pitt career

records and tied two others,
including most ﬁeld goals in one
season.

Sports Program
Growing for Women

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Women’s athletics at Pitt are no
longer merely expanded‘ extensions
of'the sports programs offered to
men. They have evolved into
cohesive units capable of producing

championship teams and potential‘

Olympic competitors.

Before last year, women’s sports
at Pitt functioned as semi-glorified
intramural athletics with no finan-
cial support to enable‘ growth into
interscholastic competition.‘

their own team. While Bullman‘
searched for a competent female
coach, Jim Banner, former coach of
the men’s team, instructed the
ﬂedgling squad. The new womens
track coach, Georgia Eberhardt,
has an asset in Martha Suhayda,
who placed fourth in the USA-
USSR Junior Women’s Games and
ﬁfth in the Pan-American Games
trials, and who was Pennsylvania
State High Jump Champion in ’,74
and ’75. The. Pantherettes also
may prove to be tough in the
hurdles, shot and discus competi-
tions. They will participate in both

tionals. - A

Eberhardt is quick to acknow- 7’ '

ledge the “tremendous amount of
cooperation from the men in
helping the women.” _
Last season’s volleyball team
had a starting line-up composed
completely of freshmen. They
ﬁnished with a 14 and 3 record,
went on to the regionals and
battled through to the quarter
ﬁnals. -
Swimming and diving competi-
tion promises great excitement via

who will represent Puerto Rico in
the Pan-American Games. And

Coach Kate Mathison also has//we

increase Pitt’s chances in free-style

competition.

Gymnastics requires more'years

of diligent practice than any other
sport. Therefore it is hard to find
these dedicated athletes, and
harder still to locate enough
talented gymnasts to build a
championship team. But Coach
Donna DeMarino and assistant
Michael Kelley are finding new
athletes to improve upon last
season’s 7 and 3 record.
Pantherette basketball deﬁnitely
will be more in focus this year. The
women’s games will be played just

- before the Panthers’ home games.

Last year’s starting quint, four of
them freshmen, posted a 10-6

record. Bullman and assistants--ﬁt;

Jean Condo, Jan Kasnevich and
Pat Wallace report successful
recruiting. There are returning
vets Debbie Jones and Kim
Reynolds to prevent the Panther-
ettes from ever being listed in the
double dribbles department.
Tennis fever has swung into
national prominence faster than

‘Billie Jean King's backhand. Pitt

is not immune to the mania,
especially with a prospect like
Maria Paris on thecourts. Paris is
a promising player who’s competed

All-~ "éloach Dick Bradshaw believes
that both the men’s and the

-a bit of All-American potential,

more so in the women’s squad than .

in the men’s.
First and foremost is Angie

In.the AAU championships held
recently in Kansas City, Stetler was

'“d in the nation in the 100-yard

uorti course and seventh in the
long course. She is rated one of the
top women tankers in the country.

On the men’s squad, Jerry
DeMuro and Dave Reeder are very
strong candidates. DeMuro has
made the Olympic trials and

_ Reeder managed to survive the
Vfirst cut at nationals his last time

The track team has three good
prospects for All-American honors
in Karl Farmer, Mike Matter and
Nick Martin. Farmer and Natter

outdoor meet last season, with
Farmer picking up a ninth place in

 the quarter and Matter, the best

J Nick Martin sat out much of last
season with an injury but came
back after only ﬁve weeks of work

just up from high school with hopes
of making it big in this, her rookie
season.

In the past we have allowed an
outsider to voice his knowledge on

the subject. Lee “No Guts”
Gutkind, professor of English here
at Pitt, will again try to win the
coveted “Yogi” Award, which he
believes was stolen from him the
last week of the ’74 season.

“Everyone knows Mack (Bart
Mack, ex-Yogi) fixed it so he could
win. I was the winner.”

As usual, the prize for winning '

the Yogi contest will go to the
person with the highest percentage
of correct games. All we can say
‘about the prize is...it is deﬁnitely
worth the effort.

Prepares to

Axe Opponents  

BY JIM LEWIS

The arrows will be ﬂying at
Schenley Park this year.

The Pitt cross country team will
hold its meets at the Schenley
Oval, and it plans to stage each
meet in “Custer’s Last Stand”
fashion.

Coach Mike Agostinella has
reason to sharpen his tomahawk
early, before the start of the 1975
season. He has powerful runners
returning in senior Nick Martin,
and sophomores Mel Boyd and
Dave McDonald.

Also donning the warpaint for
the Panthers this year will be
newcomers Ron Wirick, the Penn-
sylvania state champ in the‘
two-mile run in track, Bob Lee and
Mark Studnicki, both‘of whom have
placed very high in open meets.
Add to the list the rest of the old
and new talent, and you have a
strong cross country team.

Agostinella’s chief concern now
is to “blend the good new piople

and the good returning people into

a strong teami” He deﬁnitely is .
looking forward to the ’75 season, I
especially the home meets on
October 3 against Kent State,
October 10 against West Virginia,

and November 8 against Penn f "I

State, a meet that he terms a
“super race.” All home meets are

at Schenley Park, and spectators
are welcome.

Just beware of stray arrows.
