When Oakland’s Mad Mex res-
taurant and bar became exclusively
non—smoking in March, it did so for
moral reasons. Now, some other
Oakland establishments must fol-
low suit, a new state law says. . ’

The Clean Indoor ‘Air Act,
signed by Gov. Ed Rendell. last
Friday, will ban smoking in most

public buildings and work places _

throughout the state but will not

have a sweeping effect on Oakland A

businesses because of an exemp-
tion. ‘

’ ’ Bars or taverns that make less
than 20 percent of its total sales

from food are immune from the

ban. p
Oakland venues, including

Boomerang’s, Garage Door Sa-'
loon and Bootleggers, all of which

make little to no food sales, will rim
as usual, while _restaurant/bars like

Mama’s and Primanti Brothers will
have to be smoke-free under the
law, which takes effect on Sept. 11,
90 days after Rendell’s signing.

“Unfortunately,_ we’re upset
there are exemptions,” said Tom
Baron, owner of big Burrito Res-
taurant Group, which includes Mad
Mex.

“I think what it says is that they
care about the health of some em-
ployees but not all employees,” he
said.

Baron made the switch to non-
smoking March 1, when one of his
employees became pregnant. Bar-
on said he was sick of waiting for
the state or county to pass a smok-
ing ban and decided to make all of
his restaurants non-smoking. P

. “It was the right thing to do,”
he said.

Instead of smoking sections
and ‘_non-srnoking sections, Oak-
land customers will have to choose
between smoking bars and non-

‘ smoldng bars.

Fuel steams ahead aer all fire

by Hayley Grgurich
» 1‘l.:.4ia[a/zt Ne w E3itor
A rogue ember caused the
fuel beneath Fuel & Fuddle res-
taurant and bar’s pizza oven to
catch ﬁre last Tuesday. .
Thanks to the construction
of the oven and its ﬂame—re—
tardant materials, the ﬁre was
contained, and the restaurant

. reopened the next day.

Vic Bovalino, director of
operations for the restaurant,
was not present for the ﬁre but
spoke with ofﬁcials from the
health and ﬁre departments im-
mediately following the inci-

.. dent.

“Our pizza ovens run about
700 degrees, and a small-ember
was trapped in an oven brush
— which is an anomaly, it nev-
er happens,” said Bovalino. “It
fell underneath a storage box
where we keep the wood for
the ﬁre.”

Because of its steel outer
shell and blown ceramic inte-
rior, Bovalino said there’s no
danger of a_ﬁre spreading from
an oven to the restaurant.

“That whole area [around
the oven] is a giant ﬁrebox, so
it’s set up to contain”and"handl'e
ﬁre,” he ‘said.

Before the restaurant could
resume business, it was re-
quired -to gain clearance from

 

the Allegheny County Health .

Department. ‘ _

“It was a small structural
ﬁre in the wall behind the oven.
It did not affect any of the
food service or. the integrity of
the establishment,” said Dave
Zazac, -the spokesman for the
health department.

“All of the exposed food was
thrown out, and they opened
for business the next day.” l

The night of the ﬁre, Roy
McDonald, chief of Fire Bat-
talion BC2, said he thought the
blaze was the result of a worn
brick in the pizza oven.

Bovalino disagreed.

“I believe the ﬁre chief al-
luded to some structural dam-
age in the oven, and that’s just
impossible,” said Bovalino.
“There was no damage at all.”

that the ﬁre was accidental.

In addition to the unantici-
pated post—ﬁre inspection last
Wednesday morning, Fuel &
Fuddle was also due for a rou-
tine code inspection, which the
health department conducted
all at once. '

“They came out and checked
that all the product in use [the
day of the ﬁre] was replaced,

"that there was no structural

damage, that the duct work was

anything.”

okay and that the emergency
lighting was “operational,” said
Bovalino.

The restaurant passed each
inspection and lost only a few
hours of business the night

.of the incident. Still, had the

ﬂames been more severe and
closed the restaurant for longer,

Bovalino said a loss of revenue '

would be secondary to safety.

“In the ‘20—plus years I’ve '

been doing this, in several
restaurants, there are always
situations that come up, and the
important thing is to err on the
side of safety,” he said.

Upon discovering the ﬂames,

.Bovalino said his staff evacu-

ated the restaurant by moving
table to table, alerting the pa-
trons of the issue and asking

‘_ them to evacuate.
When‘ asked to comment,
(the ﬁre department ‘said only

On the whole, Bovalino said
he felt there was no reason to

be concerned about the future-

safety of the restaurant, nor
any reason to anticipate further
problems.

“Restaurants in general are
inﬁnitely safer than most com-
mercial businesses and nearly
every home out there,” said
Bovalino. “They’re equipped
to deal with these situations
because city codes mandate
that they must be prepared for

During his’ time in college, John
Voinski was an avid socialite. As a
Student Government Board member
and business major, he saw firsthand
the benefits that came from knowing
the “right” people.

Now, Pitt’s Alumni Association
wants others to meet those people,
too.

The "database contains 6,000 students
and alumni.

“People took it upon themselves
to talk to one another,’_’ said Voinski
of his New York City event, which
attracted 75_ attendees. '

“Peoplestaying showed they gen-
uinely enjoyed the event,” he said.

The idea for the gatherings came ,

from Alumni Outreach Coordinator

“I was pretty nervous about facing
him for the ﬁrst time [at the trial],” said
Burroughs. “But I truly believe that he
felt some remorse, and that made me
feel better.”

Burroughs said that she endured a left
wrist fracture, a broken shoulder blade
and six broken ribs. Though her bones
healed quickly, she still has difﬁculty
moving her left wrist and arm.

In addition, Burroughs said she suf-
fered burns on 26 percent of her body
from hot automobile ﬂuids. To repair
the bums, doctors surgically transferred
skin from her legs to her upper body.

She has beenputting off the intensive
physical therapy until her skin grafts
heal. As a former long—distance runner,
Burroughs has difﬁculty with her walk-
ing limitations.

“On the day of the trial, we parked
six blocks away. I was able to do that,
but that’s the farthest I’ve done,” she
said. “I still walk with a limp.”

She plans to read a statement detail-
ing her injuries as testimony for Titus’
sentencing. Common Pleas Judge Jill E.
Rangos will sentence Titus on Aug. 21.

“June 28 is the one-year anniversary

‘of the accident,” said Burroughs. “The

time seems like it went by fast, but at the
same time it seems like I’ve been hurt
forever.”

Burroughs plans to return to Pitt to
ﬁnish a master's in business administra-
tion. She said she looks forward to go-

ondhand smoke causes,” he said.

While the ban was enacted for health rea-
sons, Ardo said thatowners of establishments
with low food sales lobbied for their exemp-
tion with ﬁnancial argumenl 3.

Vic Bovalino, director of operations
for Joe Mama’s, Fuel & Fuddle and Uncle
Sam’s Subs, all located on Oakland Avenue,
said because this is a statewide ban, he thinks

the ban will not harm hisbusiness.

Ardo said that Rendell would support.at—
tempts in the legislature that would allow Al-
legheny County and Scranton to impose their
own laws, which could be stronger than the
state’s law. ,_

Both state Sen. Jay Costa, D-Allegheny,
and state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny,
have publicly said they will push for legis-
lation allowing Allegheny County and other
local governments to pass stricter smoking

bans.

When Rendell signed the act, he wrote a
message: “Although I enthusiastically signed
this bill, I do share the concerns of many of
our citizens, and some legislators, who think
we can and should do better.”

The law reads that other exceptions in-
clude certain sections of gaming halls and
casinos, private residences that aren’t used
as day care centers, tobacco shops, cigar bars
and private clubs.

without helmets

Bikers

f should use their heads

; Here’s a shocker: Since
 Pennsylvania repealed the
Euniversal motorcycle helmet
 law in 2003, deaths and
§ hospitalizations because of
 head injuries have increased.

3 A recent Pitt study released
 Thursday revealed that
1 when the law was repealed,
i helmet use by motorcyclists

5 decreased from 82 percent to
I 58 percent. As a result, there
was a 32 percent increase in
head-injury deaths and a 42
percent increase in head-injury
hospitalizations. '

No surprise there. We
_ are surprised, however, that
‘ Pennsylvania legislators‘ chose
to repeal the law in the ﬁrst
: place. The earlier law required
2 all cyclists, regardless of age,
to wear a helmet. As it stands
now, however, the law only
" requires motorcycle operators
i and riders younger than 21
; to wear helmets. Everyone
 else is free to ride without
 head protection, making them
 vulnerable to serious injury
 and death.
, Those in favor of the repeal
 argue that the state government
i does not have a right to interfere
i in the individual choices of its
1

citizens. But deciding to wear a
{ helmet is not just an individual
5 choice. Motorcycle accidents
§ not only impact the victim
j but also the victim’s family
 and friends, who .often suffer
 emotional trauma as a result.
 Accidents can also affect

 taxpayers, who are forced to

pay for the medical costs of
accident victims who lack
health insurance.

An obvious parallel to the
i helmet law is the mandatory

l
>
I
l

 seat belt law. While the decision undo their damage.

to wear a seat belt directly
aifects only one person, the

consequences of choosing not _

to can indirectly affect many 
people in the same way the 

decision not to wear a helmet ?

might. If wearing a seat belt is :

compulsory in Pennsylvania,
then wearing a helmet should
be as well.

While the state does not
always have a right to involve
itself in the personal choices
of its constituents, certain
exceptions must be made when
the safety of its citizens is in
question.

The reality is that no matter
how careful the motorcyclist,
accidents and injuries can
happen. Other drivers or
bikers on the road might not
be responsible and, because of
their actions, could hurt others.
For this, precautions must be
taken.

There is also no reason for
bikers to be concerned about
the helmet impairing their
hearing or vision. According
to ‘the U.S. Department of
Transportation, a person who
wears a helmet can hear just as
well as a person who does not.
Helmets come in many shapes
and designs. Therefore, bikers
can simply choose a kind that
does not obscure their vision.

In 2006, when Steelers
quarterbackBenRoethlisberger
broke his jaw in a motorcycle
accident while not wearing a
helmet, heated debate arose

' over Pennsylvania’s repealed

law. With the release of
this study, it’s time we re-
examined the repeal and
made every effort to inﬂuence
Pennsylvania lawmakers to

Have something tosay?

Speaking English in a country with an ‘English fetish’

by Lewis Lehe_
Colum/ultt

This is part two of my expe-
rience as an immigrant in Ar-
gentina, recounting the trials
and tribulations of my life as an
immigrant. Today’s theme:~Eng-
lish. ~

Spanish has just ﬁve vowel
sounds, all of which exist in
English, while English has 12
vowel sounds. After childhood,
it’s hard for Spanish speakers
to learn our vowels correctly.
Whenever I hear Argentines
trying hard to speak English, I
feel proud for no reason, like I
invented the extra seven vowels.

= As if it was hard for me to learn

them, too, but as a toddler I for
one had the initiative to buckle
down and say “That over there is

I an oar.”

For $5 per hour, I teach Eng-
lish to business people. They try
hard, but fall so short.

For my students, the hard “j”
is a Sisyphean labor, partly be-
cause they can’t perfect it, and
partly because I make them roll
boulders uphill while they prac-
tice. Meanwhile, I draw a picture

(6 '37

of a mouth making a hard _] .

sound.

“Your teeth should vibrate,”
I explain, “but no, it’s not like
when you’re cold.” It’s "hard,
though, since Argentines mush
y’s and j ’s and sh’s into the same
weird “ygsh.” We practice re-
peating “Sean John.”

Argentines stand for this te-
dium because they take English
seriously." Kids go to bilingual
schools. Adults take English
courses in their free time.’ One
day, a student came to class very
upset, because she’d rented an
English—language movie and
couldn’t understand the dia-
logue. The movie in question:

“A Clockwork Oranygshe.” I ex- ’

plained that I couldn’t teach her
to speak the Cockney of a dysto-
pian future. Instead we learned,
“Yinz won go donton n drenk
Am Cety?” ‘

While I like teaching, we im-
migrants hate becoming some
stranger’s language punching
bag. At ﬁrst, when people an-
swered ,my Spanish questions
with broken English answers, I
just kept speaking Spanish. But
now I am bitter, and Iact like
their accent is too. bad to under-
stand. To be clear, I do that to
make them feel bad about them-
selves. Still they try.

In the United States, we com-

plain that everything is made in.

China. But abroad, it seems like
everything is made in America
—— everything culturally acces-
sible. Although great books and
movies and music come from
everywhere, almost everything
really easy to get into and still

pretty good comes from the '

U.S.-Canada-England culture
machine. Think “The Sopranos,”

The Arcade Fire and Nicholas

Homby, respectively.

That’s why you .. can hear,
“Karmapolice,arrestthis man...”
whistled at Estacion Tribunales.
It’s why I can’t remember what
the real Sawyer talks like after
watching two seasons of “Lost”
dubbed in Spanish. I

I found more proof at a show_
for Outbreak, _a hard core rock
band from Maine. For the en-
core, the singer asked, “Who’s
heard of Bad Brains?” referenc-
ing the greatest hard core band
ever. Nobody raised his hand,
and the band launched disap-
pointedly into a Bad Brains
cover. In a ﬂash, the crowd ex-
ploded and 40 kids grappled to
scream the stream of syllables
that to them is “Sailin’ On” into
one humble microphone. It was

Impeachment shouldn’t be thrown out

by  Camarda
Cola/nniat

    
 

You’d never know it based
on mainstream press cover-
age, but Dennis Kucinich on
June 9, introduced articles of
impeachment to the ﬂoor«of
Congress. Even though Demo-
cratic Party leaders would like
to pretend this didn’t happen,
it’s still a significant and need-
ed motion.

Nancy Pelosi, the Demo-
cratic Speaker of the House,
responded through her press
secretary: “[Pelosi] believes
that impeachment would cre-
ate a divisive battle.”

A divisive battle between
whom? Democrats and Re-

publicans? As it stands now,

Congress has been unable to
overcome the smallest of is-
sues to pass legislation, and

nearly every bill must sludge '

through heavy opposition from
either party. Pelosi makes it
seem as though Congress has
overcome the partisan stran-

awesome —- and telling: It’s not
just our mainstream refuse that
washes up on foreign shores, it’s
subcultures, too.

For this reason, among oth-
ers, English is fetishized here in
Argentina. Somehow, English
gives anything an extra touch of
legitimacy. Ads for nice things
sometimes are completely in
English, as if to say, “Our cus-
tomers are the kind of decent Ar-
gentines who speak English.”

One sign for a fashion bou-

glehold in Washington, and an
impeachment effort would be
the tipping point back to old
ways.

Besides, her argument is
completely irrelevant. Never
before in U.S. history has
there been an impeachment
motion supported unanimous-
ly in Congress.

With presidential approval
ratings at historic ‘lows and
reports that Republicans are
expected to be demolished in
the upcoming election, why
not move forward with the im-
peachment?

Pelosi went on to call the
impeachment a “distraction

from Congress’s efforts to

chart a new course for Amer-
ica’s working families and
would ultimately fail.” What
a better course for American
working families than one
without a president who vio-
lates the Constitution and has
ravished the economy?
Somehow performing the
duty of Congress, to remove
a president who has acted im-

ing also promotes hedonism and
impulsive decisions, but we say,
“Live each day like it’s your
last.” We don’t bring up the fact
that if this is your last day then

you logically will have to expire

no later than tomorrow.

An advertisement for a tele-
marketing outsourcer expounds
the beneﬁts of working at Tele-
Com. Then an actress turns to the

properly, is a distraction.

Hundreds of bills are pre-
sented in, Congress that have
little hope of being passed into
law. Congress has even passed
bills knowing the president
will eventually veto them. Yet,
Pelosi feelsthat the impeach-
ment will ultimately fail and is
thus not worth pursuing.

In an era where everyone
seems to be try to distance
himself from the president,
what a better way to do it than
support his impeachment?
Granted, it is unlikely that the
measure will ultimately pass,
but to not pursue it establishes
a dangerous precedent.

Just 10 years ago, President
Bill Clinton was impeached
for perjury and obstruction of
justice. Clinton was accused
of lying about his relation-
ships with Monica Lewinsky
and Paula Jones. Kucinich’s
recent 35 articles for impeach-
ment include the warrantless
wiretapping program, the con-
stitutionality of the invasion

tertaining and providing medical

ways of a single corporate palace

mutation of Scooter Libby.

If none of the charges Ku-
cinich has made against Bush
are grounds for impeachment
proceedings, what does that
mean for the future of the
presidency?

If impeachment is not pur-
sued in earnest, then it is im-
plied that thepresident may
act above the law. In this par-
ticular situation, the president
should be held accountable for
actions that have resulted in
the death of thousands of peo-
ple as well as countless viola-
tions of the Constitution.

If lying about your sexual
relationship is enough for par-
tisan impeachment fanfare,
then shouldn’t the same at-
tention and scrutiny be paid
to a president who is respon-
sible for the most destructive
war since Vietnam and blatant
transgressions against the fun-
damental ideals that America
is built on?

the Democratic leadership in

the most unpopular president
since Richard Nixon.

I recently returned to Pennsyl-
vania from_ a trip to the Cannes
Film Festival. While I was there,
Iviewed various ﬁlms, saw beau-
tiful sights and even met a couple
of famous people. Among the
people I met were writer Charlie
Kaufman, director Spike Jonze
and the president of the United
States  from “Independence
Day.” He is commonly known
as Bill Pullman. He is less com-
monly known as the dad from
“Casper.”

While I was there, I heard
whispers of a brewing controver-
sy between two people whom I
did not meet: Spike Lee and Clint
Eastwood. Something about Clint
Eastwood’s Iwo J ima ﬁlms being
racist. ‘

Now, weeks later, the contro-
versy has continued brewing.

First, Lee criticized Eastwood
for an absence of black people in

RESEARCH STUDY

 

DEPRESSED?  
SMOKING MARUUA

Researchers at the University at Pittsburgh Medical Center
are recruiting people ages M to 25 for a medication

research study. We are seeking people who feel
depressed and smoke marijuana. Participants will receive

his two ﬁlms about the battle at
Iwo Jima. Eastwood came back
by saying that he was trying to
maintain historical accuracy and

- that Lee should “shut his face.”

Lee replied reasonably by saying
Eastwood “is not my father, and
we’re not on a plantation either.”
Who can blame him? Anyone
would have pulled the slavery
card at this point in the argument.
Here are the facts, according
to Time Magazine. Black people
made a signiﬁcant sacriﬁce in Iwo
J irna, as 700 to 900 participated in
this battle. Because of racial prej-
udice at the time, blacks mainly
worked transporting ammunition.
They undeniably had a vital role.
In Eastwood’s defense, “Flags
of Our Fathers” focuses on the

‘soldiers who planted the ﬂag on

Mount Suribachi, the ones seen in
the iconic photograph. The other
ﬁlm, “Letters from Iwo Jima” is
mainly shown from the perspec-
tive of Japanese soldiers.

- Here are some more facts:
“Flags” was released in October

on evaluation that includes a physical exam, study

medication, and treatment for three months at no cost.

Participants will be compensated after each visit.

For more details,‘ call 412-246-5'| 89
or toll-free 1-866-222-3954.

NA?  

December 2006. So why the out-
rage now? What has prompted
Lee to come out with this con-
troversy now that the ﬁlms are no
longer relevant? Would this have
not been more effective sometime
in November of 2006?

Lee’s new ﬁlm, “Miracle at St.

Anna” is released this September. _
The ﬁlm tells the story of four

black American soldiers who get
trapped in a Tuscan villagedur—
ing World War H. Perhaps this an-
swers the “why now?” question.
One would assume from the
nature of this controversy that
there is an accusation of racism
against Eastwood. What is the
goal of taking two of Eastwood’s
ﬁlms and bringing up this particu-
lar issue? Certainly Lee is imply-
ing something about the other
man.
Eastwood made a ﬁlm in 1988
called “Bird.” It was about the life
of jazz musician Charlie Parker,
played by Forrest Whitaker. The
cast of the ﬁlm consisted of many

black people. Lee was upset that
Eastwood was even making that
ﬁlm at all.

It can be safely said that black
people were not intentionally left
out of the two war ﬁlms because
of the director’s racial prejudice.
It comes down to Lee wanting
to sell movie tickets. It seems as
though Lee is manufacturing out-
rage to raise awareness about his
own ﬁlm. H

Lee had a somewhat similar
controversy with Quentin Taran-
tino in the past. He was offended
by Tarantino’s overuse of the n-
word in “Jackie Brown.” Samuel
L. Jackson came to Tarantino’s
defense.

Because of this false outrage
from Lee, a leading Italian-Amer-
ican group has _come forward with
complaints about Lee’s treatment
of Italians in his ﬁlms. The Italic
Institute of America has had com-
plaints in the past. Now they are
worried about how Lee will pres-
ent Italians in the Tuscan village
where his new ﬁlm takes place.

. Lee/Eastwood ﬁght a clever ticket seller

A 2006. “Letters” was released in

Surely, it is understandable
for outrage and offense derived
from truly insensitive material.
Hollywood is chock full of ﬁlms
that draw on stereotypes as fodder
for black side characters. Lee has
given a voice to real black charac-
ters with complexity and nuance.
For that he is to be commended.

As reﬂected by ﬁlm over the
decades, our society has come a
long way from 1915 and “Birth
of a Nation,” where Klansmen
are the heroes. It is important for
ﬁlmmakers like Lee to remind us
what we still need to ﬁx. It is also
important for these ﬁlmmakers to
place morality before publicity.

What are viewers supposed to
think about a controversy manu-
factured by Lee just a few months
before the release of his own
movie? Perhaps there is a better
question: What is more offen-
sive, a lack of black people in a
war ﬁlm or starting a controversy
about it to sell tickets?

Chesney ringleads greatest show on earth  

by Tony J ovenitti
Staff Writer

Kenny Chesney’s Poets & Pi-
rates Tour features only country acts,
but it rocked Heinz Field like only

two other concerts in the stadium’s -

history — boﬂr of which were also
headlined by Chesney.

Chesney brought his tour’s 55

Shore for the third ﬁme in four years
early Friday moming. Crews spent

the better half of two days setting up-

the mammoth stage and 5,000 amps
worth of power and sound equip-
ment —— enough energy to power a
small neighborhood for a week The

. concert has become an annual event

in Pittsburgh, and it becomes more
like a festival each year.

The festivities began late Friday
evening at Station Square with a pre-
concert  at Saddle Ridge and
Chesney’s “Next Big Star” "battle of
the bands at the Hard Rock Cafe.

Pittsburgh’s own NoMAD -
short for North of Mason—Dixon
— won the competition and the

true country sound,
which is an excellent mix of classic
bluegrass and today’s mainstream
country music. Its ﬁrst single,
“North of Mason Dixon,” sounds
like a‘ Pittsburgher’s take on Ala-

Prior to the show inside the sta-

I dium, many local acts were featured

on Y108’s small stage outside the
main gate and Froggy’s ﬂoating
stage along the Ohio River.

But the main pre-concert activ-
ity was tailgating — and Chesney’s

-fans are experts. : _

The cars started rolling inas early
as 8 am. Some brought sand and kid-

Country diva l_eAnn Rimes was

and the familiar acoustic intro of

“Days Go By” ﬂowed through the

jumping off the stage and wander-

_ Ta|kin' Trivia
Who was the last Pitt alum to
play in the MLB? '

Last week's answer: 4

—-l.

Pedro Alvarez, the first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates, takes a swing earlier in the year for the Vanderbilt Commodores. Alvarez, a third baseman, was
the second overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. It was the Pirates’ highest overall pick since the draft in 2002, when they held the first selection.

Pirates vote for Pedro in 2008

by Zack Chakan
/ladiatzz/25 S/‘aorta E3it0r

One year after a widely dead-
panned decision on draft day, the
Pittsburgh Pirates’ choice was
much easier this year.

Thanks to owning baseball’s
second—worst record last season,
Pittsburgh earned the second
selection in the June 6 Major
League Baseball draft and chose
Vanderbilt third baseman Pedro
Alvarez.

Despite being the second
pick, Alvarez was heralded as
possibly the most talented player
in this year’s pool.

But the 6-foot-2, 212—pound
junior broke his hamate bone in
his right hand this year, limiting

his overall production but still’

ﬁnishing with good numbers.

I Alvarez hit .317 this season at
Vanderbilt with nine home runs
and 30 RBIs. His career statistics

are strong as well with a total of
49 home runs in three seasons
and an average of .349.

He is known to be one of the
most major league—ready pros-
pects in the draft and could ﬁnd
his way to Pittsburgh by the end
of next year.

If he signs, that is.

. Alvarez is represented by
super—agent Scott Boras, famous
for his excessive contract de-
mands for free agents and draft-
ees alike.

Alvarez is expected to fetch
at least a $7 million signing bo-
nus.

Pirates’ management has stat-
ed that money will not be an is-
sue when making draft decisions
this year, which was a blaring
accusation after last year’s de-
bacle.

Pittsburgh held the fourth"

selection last season and chose
Clemson left-handed pitcher

Danny Moskos.

Moskos was a top‘ prospect,
and some projections had him
going as high as seventh or
eighth. But former general man-
ager Dave Littleﬁeld grabbed
him fourth.

Public and critical backlash
ensued. Georgia Tech catcher
Matt Wieters was drafted be-
hind Moskos with the ﬁfth pick.
Those same prognosticators be-
lieved Wieters was one of the
best hitters in the draft.

There would be no contro-
versy this time. The Pirates

had been targeting Alvarez for

weeks, knowing he would likely
be available because Tampa Bay
had narrowed its choices to high
school inﬁelder Tim Beckham

and Florida State catcher Buster

Posey.

Pittsburgh liked Beckham as
well,’but once Tampa Bay chose
him ﬁrst overall, Alvarez became

an ofﬁcial Pirate.

General manager Neal Hunt-
ingdon’s ﬁrst draft has been
widely acclaimed for potential
talent and risk taking, attributes
his predecessor Littleﬁeld rarely
attempted. p

Second—round pick Tan-
ner Scheppers exempliﬁes this
change in direction.

Scheppers, a right—handed
starting pitcher out of Fresno
State, has been clocked as high
as 99 mph with his fastball and
usually sits in the mid—90s. Mul-
tiple draft projections had him as
a top-10 selection.

But an injury ﬂared up in

Scheppers’ right arm, which has

been diagnosed as either a torn
labrum or a stress fracture in the
shoulder.

If Scheppers is healthy or
returns healthy with the same
pitching repertoire, Pittsburgh
might have a steal on its hands.

Littman
ranks the -
top dogs 

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

    

There’s a saying in baseball
that goes like this: Players win
and managers lose. M‘

It means that when things are’
going well, most people credit
the players. And when things are
going bad, the manager takes
the fall.

I was wondering why this
method couldn’t be applied to
all sports, but instead of coaches

_or managers,’I could just take it
a step further.

When a sport isn’t doing so
well or something goes wrong‘
why can’t we just blame the
commissioner?

That’s what I did. I made a
list of where I think the current
commissioners of the four ma-
jorsports stand in terms of how
good or how bad of a job they’re
doing right now.

I suppose if anything, it’s
more of a power ranking.

4) David Stern (NBA): May-
be last is a little harsh for the-
N BA commissioner. As of Tues-
day morning, two of the most
historic franchises in his sport
are playing in the NBA Finals
and are one away from a Game
7. 

That’s good right? '

Yes. Thenvhow could I have
Stern as my worst ranking com-
missioner right now?

The answer is Tim Donaghy.
Whether or not you fully be—"
lieve everything the former ref-
eree claims, he’s certainly put
a damper on the playoffs this
year

Last summer Donaghy was_
investigated by the FBI for bet-'
ting on games he refereed and

,Pirates, page 15

Still, because of the injury
and his status as a top talent,
Scheppers will also require a
hefty signing bonus to become
a Bucco.

‘ ‘ Answering an obvious lackjof
talent at the position, the Pirates
drafted three shortstops with
their ﬁrst seven picks, includ-
ing one in the third and fourth
rounds.

Oklahoma State’s J ordy Mer-.

cer was Pittsburgh’s third choice.
He hit 14 home runs last year
and projects to stay at the posi-
tion with some power potential.
Chase D’Amaud from Pep-
"perdine is also a nice hitter but
will probably have to be moved
to second or third base at some

point in the minors. D’Amaud
was Pi.ttsburgh’s fourth—round
pick.

The Pirates chose Scheppers’
teammate and fellow staff mem-

’ ber Justin Wilson in the ﬁfth
round. The lefty starter pitched ‘

seven innings and gave up two
runs in Sunday’s upset over,Rice
in Fresno State’s opening game
of the College World Series.
Another high—risk selection
came _in the sixth round. Pitts-
burgh chose high school out-
ﬁelder Robbie Grossman from
Texas, another player projected
to go in the ﬁrst two rounds.
Grossman has a commitment
to the University of Texas and
will require a steep bonus to

lure him away from the college
ranks. He is regarded as a great
athlete with superb tools.
Huntingdon practically ven-
tured to the North Pole for talent

- in the later rounds. Well, sort of.

Chris Aure was drafted in
the 15th round from North Pole
High School in Alaska. Many
prognosticators rank Aure as the
best prospect from Alaska since
1999. .

Other top high school tal-
ents drafted in the later rounds
because of "contract concerns
include Wesley Freeman, a 16th-
round pick, pitcher‘ Quinton
Miller from the 20th round and
third baseman Zach Wilson from
the 26th round. ’

 

ing to the 18th hole on Sunday,
Woods made a 12-foot putt to
make birdie and force an 18-hole
playoff Monday.

Woods and .Mediate were
even after Monday’s ﬁrst 18

‘holes, forcing a sudden—death

playoff.

Woods made par on the ad-
ditional hole, winning the Open
and notching his 14th major
championship. Mediate bogied
the hole and ﬁnished at plus-
one_.

points and alter outcomes. A little more
than a week ago Donaghy said that Game
6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals,
which was between the Los Angeles
Lakers and the Sacramento Kings, was
ﬁxed. —

Donaghy also said that the ﬁx was or-
dered by Stem so that the series would
go seven games. The Lakers won that
game, shooting 18 morefree throws than
the Kings and ended up winning the title
that year. Donaghy also said Stern told
referees not to call technical fouls on star
players and that one referee was private-
ly reprimanded for ejecting a star player
early in a game in 2000.

Stem has said that these remarks are
ridiculous. But whether he did it or not,
I think this is the right place to put him
right now.

Even if the Lakers and Celtics are
playing the Finals.

3) Roger Goodell (NFL): This is
where the list gets tricky: In these two
middle spots. I’m putting Goodell here
solely for the fact that right now I dislike
him more than the guy at No. 2. But not
by much. «

I think he overreacts to situations. So
far he seems more than willing to hand
out a suspension, but I still don’t think
he’s had to deal with the possibility of
suspending any star players.

Although he’s quite good, people
know Adam Jones more because his
trouble with the‘ law and the suspension
he was given. Chris Henry might not be
on the level of Jones in terms of playing
ability, but he, too, isn’t so bad.

Now could he completely change my
opinion of him if he does something a bit
more drastic with Bill Belichick and the
Patriots? Of course.

Maybe that’s just anti-Patriot bias
more than anything. But one would think
that ﬁnding out one of the greatest coach-
es in the history of the sport might have
cheated throughout a period where his
team won four Super Bowls would cause
a little stir.

Yes, he ﬁned Belichick and took away
a ﬁrst—round draft pick, but that’s not the
best he could have done. Goodell could
even have a little fun with this.

He could‘ rule that the Patriots logo
has to include the face looking into a
video camera for a few years. He could
not suspend Belichick but make him do
some type of community service, like
ﬁlm weddings and bar mitzvahs.

2) Bud Selig (MLB): Ah, he just looks
slimy. And not a cool type of slimy but
just the dirty, I-don’t-trust-you kind of
slimy. First of all, we have steroids. I

June 18, 2008

guess nobody but Selig can really say
if he knew about the rampant steroid
use over the past decade. But I doubt
he minded, especially since people like
Mark’McGwire and Sammy Sosa made
baseball popular again after the strike in
1994.

I can’t say I’m a fan of his interleague
play or instant replay coming to baseball,
but right now baseball seems to be do-
ing ﬁne. Had I written this list up a few
years back, or even a few months back,

he probably wouldn’t be second. But by
now, it’s just a process of elimination.

1) Gary Bettman (NHL): Hey, the
hockey guy! Once again, I’d say he’s
here by default.

The NHL commissioner has some-
thing on his resume most other commis-
sioners don’t have: a cancellation of his
league’s championship.

There were no Stanley Cup Finals for
the 2004-05 season because of a lockout.

But it’s been just a few years since and

Goodell need to up their game

look at how things have panned out. The
league just had an exciting Stanley Cup
ﬁnal that featured young superstar Sidney
Crosby. There are also a good number of
other young stars around the league.

But most importantly, as far as we
know, his league isn’t dealing with an
abundance of stealing or illegal video-
taping.

And even better, his name is now awe”-
some because we can say he’s taunting
the NBA. 4
