Racism Hit
By Faculty
Committee

By PEGGY ALLEN

A group of faculty members
have formed a committee to elim-
inate racism from the University.
A statement signed and circula-

ted by them stated:

“We, the undersigned faculty
of the University of Pittsburgh,
recognize that the University has
been and still is a racist institu-
tion. We are pledged to correct
this situation immediately.”

This committee has had four
meetings thus far. At one of these
meetings, the faculty met with
members of the Black Action So-
ciety where they drew up their
petition. At another meeting,
they met with members of the
Black Community. These two
meetings, said one of the signers,
Malcom MacNair, served as “an
exercise in listening.”

Mr. MacNair also referred to
this committee as an example of
“Professor Power.” The faculty,
he said, can “help determine who
is hired at the University and
some of the policy.” Already, the
Pitt Book Store has agreed to have
a section of books by black
authors and about black history
and culture.

Another of the committee mem-
bers, David Bramhall, said that
“this statement, (the petition) is
obviously true for virtually every
institution in this country is rac-
ist. At the University of Pitts-
burgh, our sins are of obmission

—— not. We have overlooked the

problems of the Negro.” He ad-
ded that he is “proud of the way
Pitt has come through in the last
few months.”

One of the signers, Richard To-
bias, refused to say anything to

Black Action Society Lists

Demands To Administration

The Black Action Society is a new organization on campus represen-
ting the Black community of the University.They hope to end racism
l'nicersity by establishing Black cultural courses. in-
creasing the numbers of Black enrollment and Black faculty members.
The following statement was issued by the Black Action Society last

Thursday .-

“The Black Action Society
is the organization of the Black
community on the campus of
the University of Pittsburgh.

Recognizing that the white ra-
cist structure of the University of
Pittsburgh has failed to meet and
understand t h e fundamental
needs of Black people, and in or-
der to insure the survival of the
Afro-American student in a racist
and hostile environment, we of
the Black Action Society on May
30 presented to the administration
of the University a list of de-
mands.

The key demands are:

—We demand that the Univer-
sity double its Black enrollment
beginning September 1968 and to
continue each year until the
Black student compose at least 20
per cent of the total population
of the University. To increase and
maintain Black student enroll-
ment we propose the following.

a. that a Black recruiting team
employed by the University be
established to specifically attract
Black students.

b. that the true role of the Black
man in history be incorporated in-
to the history courses now being
taught at the University.

c. that the number of black fac- .

ulty be increased and the present
members elevated in stature. Also
that prospective Black professors
be interviewed by the Black
Action Society prior to hiring and
that our opinion be one of the
determining factors in the final
decision of hiring.

d. that a Black Studies Pro-

Chance1lor’s Appointment-

gram, which would be staffed and
directed by Black scholars in its
entirety, be instituted immediate-
ly at the University. This program
would have the same status as a
department but would be inter-
departmental in nature. Black pro-
fessors in the Departments of Pol-
itical Science, History, Socio-
logy, Anthropology, English, Psy-
chology, Music, Economics, and
Fine Arts would present the Black
existence from the point of view
of their respective fields of study.

—We demand that all programs
that have been are and will be
instigated by the University af-
fecting the Black community he
brought to the immediate atten-
tion of the Black Action Society.

—The University of Pittsburgh
is building on land needed by
the Black community. We de-
mand an end to such programs
which take up much housing
space.

To date the University has us-
ed a number of diversionary tac-
tics to steer our attention away
from the original demands. The
demands have met with the tra-
ditionally sincere paternalism in-
herent to the racist foundation of
the city fathers of Pittsburgh and
the University in particular.

We conclude that unless our
demands to alter the University’s
negative attitude toward the
Black community and to realisti-
cally portray the historical con-
tributions of the Black Man in
Pittsburgh and the United States,
are immediately met, this institu-
tion should not be allowed to fun-
ction.” ’

The first ripples of student power are being felt as Univer-
sity students are flexing their new-found muscles.

Student Government (SG) is working toward an increased
student involvement in policy-making decisions. The Faculty
Senate recently passed an amendment to its bylaws allowing the
SG President to speak before that body when the occasion arises.
The Faculty Senate passed another resolution permitting students
to sit on Faculty Senate Committees Thursday.

The Black Action Society, a new campus organization repre-
senting the University’s Black students is striving to end “the
white racist structure of the University.” They submitted a list
of demands to the administration last week.

Student power has finally come to this University, not in
terms of physical force, but in constructive suggestions aimed
at improving this institution. (See also: “What We’re After” and

S.G. Again Successful
In Student Power Fight

By PAUL STOLLER, Editor

Student Government (SG) has taken another successful ‘step
in its student power movement.

The University Faculty Senate passed a resolution Thurs-
day allowing students to sit on Faculty Senate Committees. The
resolution passed the Senate unanimously.

The resolution submitted to the Faculty Senate by SG President
Ken Schueler, allows two students selected by the SG Senate to sit
on the Faculty Committees concerning the Library, Athletics, Admis.
sions, Student Affairs, Organization and Procedures, and Educational

Policies

Ken Schueler told the Pitt
News that selected students will
begin deliberating with the vari-
ous Faculty Senate Committees
in the fall. '

Schueler was
with the action taken by the Fac-
ulty Senate. “The passage of the
resolution is a very convincing
gesture on the part of the faculty,”
the SG President said.

With students sitting on Fac-
ulty committees, a new vehicle
for communication will be born
in the fall, according to Schueler.
“Eventually, this new innova-
tion,” says Schueler, “will pro-
vide the precipitating force in
the promotion of student-faculty
alignment on important issues.”

The SG President made the fol-
lowing statement directly follow-
ing the passage of the resolution:
“This resolution is a structural
innovation intended to bridge a
serious gap of ‘communication be-
tween the students and the fac-
ulty ou issues of joint concern.”

Schueler warned, however, that
“the effectiveness of this change
will be contingent upon the par-
ticipating members of the faculty
committees.”

Schueler also spoke to the Fac-
ulty Senate Thursday on his
views of the Black Action Socie-
ty. He maintained that the Black
Action Society (BAS) is not mere-
ly another student organization.
It is a cultural, social and poli-
tical force structured on a con-
sistent ohilosophy governing the
the development of “a people”
within our University and society.

the new group: “I am prepared
today to give my personal sup-
port to these programs (BAC pro-
grams) and activities and for suf-
ficient operational funds to facil-

phone use, and printing.”
The SG President appealed to
the SG Allocations Committee

to “fulfill the. Society’s request -

for its programs funds.

But Schueler also stressed the
forthcoming white reaction to the
BAC. “There are a great num-
ber of white students,” says Sch-
ueler, “who do not understand
the striving of a people, for an
ethnic cultural indentity for socio-
economic equality. It will be my
personal and public task to try to
generate among white students
an understanding of the Black
problem and to convey the
BAS’s role not only in our Uni-

versity, but in our community

What We’re After

The Student Government (SG) campaign to improve stu-
dent - faculty communication and cooperation and to get stu-
dents into the mainstream of the decision making process at
the University is a step in the right direction. It is first a step
in the long upward path toward student identification.

This new SG movement is essentially geared to a funda-
mental of the student power formula—the increased participa-
tion of students in University affairs. The SC President now
has the right to air his thoughts, programs and desires to the
Faculty Senate. Moreover, students, in the fall, will sit in on
deliberations of Faculty Senate Committees. These are impor-
tant developments for they mark an end to the long era of stu-
dent-faculty ignorance—the beginning to the end to the pro-
blem of the student-faculty lack of communication and coop-
eration.

go beyond changes in the Faculty Senate. Now that students
will be able to sit on Faculty committees there must be a new
responsibility on part of both the students and the faculty.
Student-Faculty cooperation is an essential factor to the
whole student power scene. But all of the students and fac-
ulty must stand united if equlibrium is to be restored to the
unbalanced atmospheric content of the University Commun-
ity.

The Pitt News must agree with the SG philosophy on
Student power. We condemn student violence as being irre-
sponsible. And along with SG, we maintain that such irrespon-

sibility will not be connected with our attempts to improve the
student’s rights at this University. -

But this doesn’t mean that we will soft sell our demands;
it doesn’t mean that we will sell out to the Administration.
Nor does it mean that we will settle for anything less than
that which we demand for we will be relentless in the pursuit
of demands.

SG and The Pitt News will, in the future, work hand in
hand in a united effort to redress the inequities that now exist

ulty and the administration.

In the fall, The Pitt News and SG will present demand af-
ter demand to the Administration. And we assert right here
and now that it is about time that all of the long standing stu-
dent problems be eradicated.

One of those problems concerns the University Book-
store. This issue has been swept under the carpet. But inform-
ed sources have told The Pitt News that the administration
is on the verge of cancelling the 10 per cent discount on
hard - back books. We warn the administration that this would
indeed be a poor decision to make for it would clearly reveal
their lack of student concern.

But we are not satisfied with merely a 10 per cent dis-
count on hard-back books. As students at this university we de-
serve a full 10 per cent across the board discount (paper backs
and hard backs,) And we will not settle for anything less.

The Pitt News discounts the administration’s argument
that an across the board discount is not financially feasible.
We firmly believe that if there is a will, there is a way. If the
Administration truly wants students to have a full discount on
books, they will take the various measures to insure that dis-
count.

If the administration should balk at our suggestions, the
research files of The Pitt News will be opened and we will
reveal valid evidence that will, most assuredly, convince the

Administration that a 10 percent across the board discount on
books is quite necessary.

How can any administrator/say that the University is stu-
dent oriented when the bookstore-—a business enterprize that
attracts city-wide patronage—doesn’t even give the students
here a meaningful discount?

This que.-. mi points to an intolerable situation that must
be corrected. And The Pitt News and SG combined with the
faculty and the student body will use all of or“ plentiful
resources to allieviate this ludicrous thorn in our . :5.

Black Action Society

Demands Must Be Met

By BRUCE LEVENSON

The demands of the Black
Action Society (BAS) are real-
istic and require the support
of the entire University. The
implementation of these sugges-
tions are neces-  
sary to this cam-
pus if it is to re-
main a vital pro-
gressive force in
the community.

The creation of I
the Black Action
Society has awak-
ened the long ,-

  

sleeping Univer-
sity community _
to the problems

of the Blacks on LEVINSON
this campus. These problems are
very real and demand im-
mediate action.

It is appaling that a Universi-
ty of 16,000 students has only a-
bout 170 Blacks in its enrollment.
Equally appalling is the fact that

   

their is only a handful of Black
faculty members. of which their
are only about five teaching un-
dergraduate courses.

The establishment of a Black
culture. according to Roy Mor-
row, a member of the BAS. is of
prime importance in ending rac-
ism. The Black Studies Program
and the incorporation of the role
of the Black man in history are
essential in the creation of a
Black identity. The history of the
Black man has been too long hid-
den and distorted. The time has
come to end what James Farmer
hascalled “the magnolia tree”

 image of the American Black and
’ teach the undistorted facts of the

history and heritage of the Afri-
can peoples. It is compulsory for
the University to hire Blacks to
teach these courses. It is also nec-
essary that the BAS have an in-
fluential voice in deciding who
will teach these courses.

An increaded Black enrollment
is imperative to the needs of the

Black Society as a whole. Educ.
tion is a key that can open many
of the doors that are now barred
to uneducated or inadequately
educated Blacks. The Black re-
cruiting team would be an im-
portant instrument for encourag-
ing more Blacks to apply to this
University.

Finally, the BAS should be
consulted on all Univ. programs
concerning the Black commun-
ity. Since they are educated mem-
bers of the Black community de-
dicated to its improvement, their
opinions should be of great value
toward the success of these pro-
grams. I

It is important to note that SG
and a number of the University
Faculty have already announced
that they are supporting the BAS.
It is important that the student
body also give their wholeheart-
ed support to these programs. An
equal place for the Black Ameri-
can in our society has been long
overdue.

How Our Readers See It. 

Use Pitt News ‘Coop’ Power

Editor.

I fear that the editorial in the
June 21st edition of The Pitt News
was the unfortunate outcome of
one of two possible circumstances:

(1) The lack of important or
news-worthy happenings during
the long summer and or

(2) The rumored, unkept secret
that SG is planning its own news-
paper has finally slipped out to
the Pitt News staff.

Not to be misunderstood, I do
see great importance in the atten-
dance of students at faculty and
administrative meetings. In fact,
this was an original, investigated
proposal of the USA platform
during the last SG campaign. I,
too, believe in “students’ rights”
and student expression.

However, you must be practi-
cal. How can you promise a
staunch campaign, hand-in-hand
with SG, without mentioning a
single specific? Sure, banner-wav-
ing is fun, as are band-wagon gen-
eralities. But how can you expect
the cooperation of an administra-
tion by threatening them now with
what you’ll do to them in the fall‘?
If the problems (the ones you had
in mind at the time of the editor-
ial) are so great as to deserve this
threat of a united student front,

urns MAN ON CAMPUS

why wait until fall?

I think you should “cut the big
talk” and threats of what’s to
come. Use the power of the edi-
torial to present problems when
the time is right . . . instead of
predicting what will come three
months from now. And’ don’t sell
every student out by promising
that there will be only one opin-
ion on this campus when fall
arrives.

The Pitt News is an indepen-
dent power on campus and should
not have to promise a “business
merger” with any other organi-
zation, regardless of rumored
plans.

When the problem is here, act
rapidly and persistently. Dra.V.\f
attention to the “inequities”, but
do it sensibly. I think that per-
haps the word “power” is getting
a little hackneyed. Why not try a
new term . . . cooperation.

A number of students, however,
are laying the foundations for an-
other journal. The Pitt News
finds nothing objectionable to an-

Editor, The Pitt News:

How come certain of your ad-
visors consider us fools?

Look at the publicity of the
movie advertised Friday, May 24,
presents its feature-as “Swivels
from one sexual titillation to an-
other!” (I can’t find my Webster
to elucidate the exact meaning of
the ad, so I’ll complete it with
the other description given there).

“Its predominant appeal to a
shameful or morbid interest in
sex”. Then, one week later the ad
for the same movie has become:
“Recommended for ONLY the
most mature! ”

  pell Robert   Kennedy: C—o—m-p-a-s-svi-ovnva-tee

It Was His Gift
Of Greatness
To Many Peoples

by ARMAND T. BELLY

I would like to speak to you today about
Robert F. Kennedy. In the past weeks we
have heard many eulogiese about this man but
most of them have tended to idealize him be-
yond what he really was; most of them have
tended to ignore those qualities which gave
him his real greatness.

Robert Kennedy didn’t have the gift of
scholarship of Eugene McCarthy nor the great
intellect of Woodrow Wilson. He lacked the
physical charm of his brother John and the
adaptive personality of Richard Nixon. He was
indeed ruthless at times. and. as all politicians,
somewhat opportunistic. ’

But Robert Kennedy had a gift which few men
have - the gift of compassion. Perhaps it would be
in order to explain what compassion is. what it
means. It’s not very easy to explain». We know that
Christ had compassion. He expressed sorrow at suf-
fering, pity at those who suffered. We know that
Martin Luther King was compassionate. He left
a secure life as a minister to champion the cause of
the poor. We also know that few men would do
what Christ did or King did. We know that few men
really care about the suffering of others.

The Di ﬂicult Path

It would have been very easy for Robert Ken-
nedy to ‘ignore the needs of the poor. to ignore the
needs of those less fortunate than he. It would have
been very easy for Robert Kennedy to have followed
the secure path while ignoring the plight of the
Vietnamese peasants. the South African black or
the American poor. It would have been very easy
for Robert Kennedy to have followed the path of
Eugene McCarthy — speaking about the poor solely
in glittering generalities.

But Robert Kennedy did not choose the easy
path.- He chose the difficult one. It was even more
difficult because he was a politician. One always
sensed a friction between Robert Kennedy the poli-
tician and opportunist and Robert Kennedy the com-
passionate. We know that in 1965 he applauded
those who sent blood to the North Vietnamese. We
know that several months later. because of politi-
cal pressure, he was forced to retract the statement.
But what other American politician would have
even thought of suggesting that to relieve the suf-
fering of the enemy was a noble endeavor? What
other American politician would have reacted to
human suffering in such a manner?

It was with the black man’s struggle that Robert
Kennedy felt most at home. He readily admitted
that before becoming Attorney General he couldn’t
have cared less about their needs and desires. He
readily admitted that concern for the black man
grew as he grew in age and maturity. By the time
of his death Robert Kennedy was the last link be-
tween white and black America. He was recognized
by the black man as the only white man who really
understood. Whether he was in Watts, or in Har-
lem his people responded. They responded to him
because they knew he cared.

But perhaps his real personality. his real charac-

ter. was revealed best when he was with children.
David Murray of the Chicago Sun—Times followed
Sen. Kennedy on his campaign. While campaign-
ing in Indiana Mr. Murray sent the following dis-
patch which was published in the Pittsburgh Press.
May 5th.

-No Joy Until. . .

“At first, there was no joy at all on the faces of
the dozen of so five—year-olds in the tiny. dirty
playground at the day nursery.

They stared with wide, solemn eyes through the
old fence topped with dropping barbed wire at
Robert F. Kennedy. who had walked 100 feet down
the street to see them stand in their cage.

Tentatively, they poked their fingers at him
through the fence and he pushed his fingers back
at them and there was a smile or two. on both sides.

But the children still didn’t quite know what to '

make of this man who was surrounded by all the
other people with the cameras and microphones and
tape recorders and notebooks.

When he started talking to them you could
hardly hear what he said. it was so soft. and his
eyes kept talking and stroking their fingers with
his and then one little boy said: “Hey, you’re on
television. arn’t you?” And Sen. Kennedy nodded
and said yes, he was.

The place was the Day Nursery Association of
Indianapolis, and it lies in a grubby section only
a few steps away from James Whitcomb Riley’s
house. Sen Kennedy had gone to the Riley house
as part of his campaign for the presidency.

Sen. Kennedy walked to the day nursery, most-
ly for children of broken homes.

He Opened A Gate

So Sen. Kennedy stopped with the children for
a minute and afterthey got to know him a bit bet-
ter the man who wants to be president pushed
open a gate and went inside and hunkered down
and talked to them some more.

The television cameras and microphones were
there, but that didn’t make any difference to the
children.

Some of them continued to slide down the slid-
ing board or climb on the jungle gym but others
clustered around Sen. Kennedy, not saying much.
some of them. but just trying to hold onto him.

Two.little girls came up and put their heads
against his waist and he put his hands on their
heads. And suddenly it was hard to watch, because
he had become in that moment the father they did
not know.

Gone, for just a moment was the rhetoric and
the playing with audiences and the motorcades and
the adulation and the criticism.

The word that came on strongest, as he sat and
listened to the children and made a quiet remark
now and then, was the word “compassion. ”

This is because — and anyone who has ever
dealt with five—year-olds knows this - you can fool
a lot of people in a campaign, and you can create
phony issues if you want to, and you can build an
image with a lot of sharpsters around you with
their computers and their press releases.

But lonely little children don’t come up and put
their heads on your lap unless you mean it.”

It was perhaps this quality of compassion that
caused Sen. Kennedy his greatest difficulties. It
made him hated in the South because he loved
blacks. It made him hated in suburbia because

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

he identified with the poor and not with the aspira-
tions of the middle class.

Most Disturbing Thing

But perhaps the most disturbing thing was the
reaction 06 ‘intellectuals’ to this man. Intellectuals
pride themselves in being detached from society» -
on looking at things cooly and logically. They pride
themselves in being able to conquer emotion and in
the process they’ve conquered compassion. Sen.
McCarthy appeals to intellectuals because he’s calm,
rational, and cold. He speaks their language. He
as well as intellectuals play games with words while

' ignoring the meaning of lives. The black man to the

intellectual and McCarthy are statistics, to Ken-
nedy they were human beings.

America has lost more than a Kennedy, more
than a politician, more than a great statesman.
America has lost its very conscience. It may be that
Sen. Kennedy was an anachronism. It may be that
in this age of bureaucracy, of corporation, of the
large depersonalized university compassion is ir-
revelent. But it is more likely that in this deperson-
alized scientific age what is really needed is com-
passion and a sort of romantic view of the World

with an unending optimism in the future. What is A

really needed is a recognition that compassion is
more important than objectivity, that what Amer-
ica needs is many score of men who will say:

“Some men see things, as they are and say why.
I dream things that never were and say. why not.”
