_ Committee to Recruit

(A. New Vice Chancellor

A committe has been formed to
f'ind someone to fill the new posi-
tion of Vice Chancellor for Plan-
ning and Budget. which Vice Chan-
cellor of Finance Edison .\Iont-
gomery was to fill.

According to Allen Pond. Asso-
ciate Dean of Public Health and
chairman of the committee. it
was established to act as an advi-
committee to Chancellor
Posvar who asked the commit-
tee to give him a list of names for
his consideration.

Pont pointed out that the Chan-

‘ cellor is eager to find a capable

person soon.

The Chancellor expressed his
concern in a recent communica-
tion to administrators while so-

liciting their advice on the selec- '

tion of a new'Vice Chancellor.

“I have an urgent problem of
recruiting. compounded by a prob-
lem of continuity. inasmuch as
three key new officers are com-
ing intothe University this sum-
mer as my appointees Provost
Rhoten Smith. Vice Chancellor for
Operations Dutton. and Execu-
tive Assistant to the Chancellor C.
R. Cable. I am happy to add these
three strong individuals to my
own team. but now. with four top
officers changing. the personal
burdens upon me during the fall
months will be severe."

‘ nees.

Pond says the Chancellor wants
the committee to work quickly so
that the new administrator can
take over by Oct. 1. "I assume
it will take us a month at least."
he commented.

The committee, which has al-'

ready met several times, is com-9
posed of Associate Provost Don-
ald Henderson; Director, Contin-
uing Education for Women, Mrs.
Caryl M. Kline; Dean, Graduate
School of Business, H. J. Zoffer;
Director, Government Relations,
Russell M. Arnold; and Assistant
to the Chancellor, Dr. David R.
Powers.

Pont described the men.
whom they ‘are looking.

for

“We're less concerned about
finding a budget technician. We
need someone who understands
budget and budget strategy. The
person were likely to choose will
be someone who has been identi-
fied with long-range planning in a
university atmosphere."

\

Pond said they will be consider-
ing people both from inside and
outside the University commun-
ity. The largest amount of nomi-
according to Pond: has
been Pitt'people..He said they are
also considering people from foun-
dations. government. and busi-
ness. '

Cites Headaches,

byPOHLASNHTH
News Editor .
Edison Montgomery. Vice
Chancellor of Finance has de-
cided not to accept the position
of Vice Chancellor of Budget-
ing and Finance.
In an effort to disperse the re-

sponsibilities of the Office of F1-

nance. the office lias been divided

into the Office of Operations and

the Office of Planning and Budget.

.\Iontgomery was to filllthe posi-'
tion of Planning and Budget. while

a new administrator. Joseph A.

Dutton. Jr.. has been hired to be-

come Vice Chancellor for Opera-

tions.

Health Professions Alluring

‘Instead. Montgomery has ac-
cepted.the position of Assistant
Vice Chancellor of the Health Pro-
fessions.

Montgomery. who served as
acting Vice Chancellor for the

Health Professions. 1961-66. said -

he has been eager to return for
about a year. He is excited about
a proposal to join private hos-
pitals and the University under
one Board of Directors. “The new
job looks attractive." he said.

However. the lure of the health
professions did not alone account
for Montgomery's decision’-.

grounds. and parks in the cleared
lots; distribution of free garbage

drums. enforcement of building’

codes and litter ordinances. and a
rodent control program.

“I think its a good thing.“ re-
sponded Mayor Pete Flaherty.
"I'm very encouraged with the
idea of the citizens who know what
they need. working with the city."

Mayor Flaherty demonstrated
his support by bringing a pair of
work gloves as well as trucks,
hilifts, and men to operate the
equipment. Steve George, ‘direc-
tor of the Bureau of Lands and
Water, and Bill Edkins, director
of the Department of Public
Works, also came to help organize
the cleanup operation.

Allegheny County donated mon-

ey. topsoil. and railroad Lies to
shore up sagging land.
Applications for federal funds
have also been made under an in-
terim grant made to Pittsburgh
for the Hill District. and South
Homewood to start the program

u running on a full-time basis.

Alvin Busey, coordinator of the
H-B Cleanup Coalition, listed the
goals of the Coalition: to create
a sense of community pride, raise
property values, and attract small
businesses.

MONTGOMERY: One of a Kind?

“I've been ceasing to get satis-
faction from my position,” he
said. “It was losing its element of
fun. No one wishes to admit fail-

ure, but the job was getting to be

too much for me.”

Noting the disadvantages of
ho1ding.a high administrative
position. Montgomery compared
the rising complexities of higher
education planning to trying to
play a three or four dimensional
chess game.

Asked to define the position of
Vice Chancellor for Planning and
Budget. Montgomery said. “I see
him as more of a staff man and
advisor to the Chancellor than a
figure of power."

' Mold Broken

versity in 1956 as Director of Per-
sonnel. He has also served as Di-

Survive Press Strike

byMARLENEZNOY

_ Today. 28 days after the Typo-
grahical Union went on strike
against the Pittsburgh Press
Company. Pittsburgh is still with-
out its two daily newspapers.

Out-of-town and suburban pa-
pers have picked up the business
left open by the Pittsburgh Press
and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and.
in the words of a cashier at the
Webster Hall Hotel. are "selling
like hotcakes." The hotel has in-
creased its supply and sale of
Cleveland. Philadelphia and New
York papers. ' ,

"I sold about 80 New York
Times in one hour this morning
and had reservations for 50 more.“
the cashier said.

The Forum, a Pittsburgh week- ‘

ly. has increased its circulation’
by nearly 3.000 copies.

Ironically, the least missed
item in a newspaper strike is
probably the news, ‘since many
people normally rely on televi-
sion and radio for news reports.
Since the advent of the newspa-
per strike, local television sta-
tions have expanded their regu-
lar news programs to include tele-
vision programming schedules,
drama critics, and the comic
strips.

The four per cent decrease in
sales over last year for the week

the stores were open a half day

weren’t last year, though sales
figures were compared without

“Friends” Offering Help

by NANCY WHITAKER

Dial 687-5145 or University
Extension 6773 anytime between
8 p.m. and 2 a.m. and you'll hear

a warm, sincere voice offer. “A ‘

Little Help from Your Friends.“
Sponsored by the Pitt YMCA. this
program offers a drug counseling
service run by students for stu-
dents.

Chuck Radler, the mustached.
23-year-old originator and coor-
dinator of the program. said that
while there were many drug
counseling agencies off campus.

. there is a definite demand for a

center on campus with the stu-
dents‘ needs primarily in focus.

According to Chuck, the drug
users on the street are usually
"high" oriented. while in a cam-
pus atmosphere. hard narcotics
don't play as large a role as the
marijuana toked at parties. acid
used for an occasional high. or
amphetamines used as as pick-me-
up before exams. He said that the
slogan "Drugs will ruin your life
and kill you" won't even phase
the student who pulls a 3.0 aver-
age and smokes grass every once
inawhile.

Chuck pointed out that the
center’s purpose is not so much
to tell students to stay away from
drugs as to answer any questions
they might have or offer a “little
help” in any way possible.

Comedy Duo Revolting

by RON LOZOWSKI

Richard Rollins and Howard
Kerr form the comedy duo known
as the Congress of Wonders.
Their first release. Revolting, is
exactly what the name implies.

The two resemble l'.S. (‘on-
gress in that both turn out reams
of stale. often pointless. rhetoric.
however. Congress at least may
be credited with an occasional
worthwhile accomplishment . . . a
virtue this album clearly lacks.

One wonders where Fantasy
Records—the same label for

WTAE Radio will present “We
Remember Wes,” a tribute to
late guitarist Wes Montgom-
ery Tuesday from 9-11 p.m.
The program will feature the
music of Montgomery and in-
terviews with the guitarist, his
wife, and his friends and as-
sociates in the music industry.

IfIt’s from Hardy &Hayes...

which the Creedence Clearwater
Revival records—finds the cour-
age to put out such a waste of
plastic. If you've ever had the
urge to flip a record through the
air to shatter it against the wall.
then this is the disc youve been
waiting for.

Rollins and Kerr appear to have
chosen the most riddled targets
they could find and their desper-
ate attempts to inspire laughter
are truly pathetic. 'Any resem-
blance to humor is purely coinci-
dental.

lated takeoff on the televion pro-
gram. Star Trek, drags on and
on. scarcely drawing a giggle.

B Monty’s Candor, Talent

Will BeSorely Missed

The slight man in the rumpled gray suit munched a tasteless
hamburger. as he mulled over the alternatives of an impending de-
cision.

His furrowed brows and wrinkled forehead betrayed anxiety.
but his calm, imperturbable manner suggested he had learned to
live with it. .

Edison Montgomery has served as Vice Chancellor for Finance
of the University of Pittsburgh since 1967. His work has often been

‘ grueling, and it might have driven a lesser man to incompetence or
. insanity.

But “Monty” has remained a paragon of cool efficiency,
through many 'ordeals. Even when he disagreed sharply with
someone else’s views, he expressed himself lucidly and calmly,
arousing not rancor but respect.

Surrounded by administrators who value "crisis management“
more than idealism, Montgomery has dared to be different. and has
taken great pains to be honest. blunt. and forthright.

Montgomery’s keen sense of responsibility. however. has taken
He
believes he needs a change of pace.

Montgomery’s decision not to fill the new Vice Chancellor for
Planning and Budget position leaves a demanding job open and
deprives the Chancellor of a skilled and experienced planner and
budget analyst at his right hand. -

Moreover. the decision comes at a time of difficult transition.
Provost Charles Peake, Executive Assistant Chancellor Jack Free-
man. and Montgomery—mainstays of the administration for years-
areall leaving the inner circle during the next several months.

Without three of his key aides. Chancellor Posvar will be put
to the test. "With four top officers changing. he wrote in a recent

memo. “the personal burdens upon me during the fall months will
be seyere." '

The University may face a difficult year.

A special Advisory Committee to the Chancellor. headed by
Dr. Allen Pond. is currently trying to find a replacement for a man
who may be irreplaceable.

The Pitt News hopes that the new Vice Chancellor for Planning
and.Budget will demonstrate the same qualities of competence.
candor, and idealism for which Edison Montgomery is respected and
admired.

Big School Blues
Can Be Overcome

by JEAN WEIDNER
Special to the Pin News

A large university can be intimidating to a
new student. As a transfer student (Community
College of Allegheny County. ‘Allegheny Cam-
pus). I know the feeling.

The transfer student from a small college has
a special problem. I was "spoiled“ by small class-
rooms. personal rapport with the faculty. and the
confidence of an ever-increasing body of friends.

On my first day at Pitt. I was feeling pretty
alienated when I decided to walk into the Tuck
Shop. Here I was even more miserable. Not
one friendly face did I see. Where were all the
people I knew who transferred with me to Pitt‘? ‘

Students passed by with their friends, and
even though other students were sitting around
looking just as lonely and helpless, you don’t
feel kind toward anyone else when you're trying
to look casual and self-assured while nursing a
coke for an hour.

Not one to feel sorry for myself for too long
a time-.-~I decided to map out a strategy. A friend
suggested trying the Hunt Room in the Student
Union because, it was smaller and easier to meet
people there. I ~

speak to him. I hope you will. too.

The first day I went in. it was pretty crowded.
I walked over to a table, not noticing that any-
one else's books were there. After getting my
coffee. I came back to find a long-haired guy
peering though his glasses at a philosophy book.
I kind of panicked.

I really wasn’t ready to impose myself on any-
one just yet, but I meekly interrupted him, ask-
ing some dumb question like was he reading the
book for a class. But patiently and with a friendly
smile, he answered, and I had met my first friend.

Fron then on, it seemed easy. My huge lec— 3
ture classes. I found. were broken down into
small recitation sections. where students express-
ed genuine enthusiasm for their course work.

Soon I began running into more students
from‘Communit_v College (it seems that not
everyone attends the first few days of classes».
Students of only "nodding acquaintance" be-
came like long-lost friends. able to depend on
each other if only for the reason they _had shared
the same old school together.

What could have been a nightmare turned out
to be a wonderful experience‘. I hope the next
time I notice a student looking like a lost puppy.
I'll remember, my own loneliness and go over and

More Kids-Less Pollution?
Editor:

In a recent issue of the Pitt
News. you ran a Zero Popula-
tion ad using the Lennon family
picture. The ad was discrimin-
ating against large families and
probably as mistaken on future
population predictions as was
Malthus in the 19th century. I
am not a Lawrence Welk-Len-
non sisters fan but does ZPG
have the right to exploit a fam-
ily which just doesn't happen
to meet ZPG‘s specifications?

Many -recent articles and
studies show that the ZPG num-
bers game is dubious. “Demog-
Z lWal1 St.
Journal. Aug. 27. 1970) and “The
Nonsense Explosion“ «New Re-
public. April 4. 1970) point out
that the quality of life would not
become materially better just
through a halt in population
growth and the "capital cost
of programs to control pollu-
tion wouldn’t be greater if the
population climbed to 300 mil-
lion-but it would be easier for

i ' 300 million to pay the cost.“

_‘;,n:34ivu .-.4“

The alarm over population is
equally absurd and illegal in
the light of scientific achieve-
ments in agriculture. the poten-
tials of the sea as a source of
food. the declining birth rate.
the continual loss of population
in large cities. and the fact
that for the first time in the
60‘s. the race of mankind pro-

duced more than it repro-
duced lU.N. Statistical Year
‘Book 1970).

Perhaps the saddest and most
harmful results of ZPG is the
open discrimination as exhibited
in the “Pitt News” plus the more
subtle discrimination it rein-
forces against illegitimate child-
ren, monogoloids, other retar-
dates, the children of the poor
and non-users of contraceptives
and abortion.

By our apathy and stupidity
we have allowed the ZPG men-
tgality to focus our attention on

people and families rather than
on the real polluters of our
times—the automobile. the in-
dustrialists. the capitalists. How
illogical can we get proposing
legislation that puts additional
tax burdens on the middle class
or poor family with eight child-
ren struggling to get by using a
scant amount of water. driving
used cars. and eating a ground
beef diet?

How about tax legislation
sponsored by ZPG for rich child-
less couples with three swim-
ming pools. three or four homes.
a huge garage and driveway that
resembles a parking lot‘?

How about a few ads in the
“Pitt News” calling attention to
this style of life? How valid can
a philosophy he that stresses
people control while .J&L still
belches out billows of smoke
and untold companies turn our
river system into ahuge cess
pool.?

Norman Podhoretz in the
April issue of Commentary re-
fers to ZPG philosophy as
ethnic suicide and goes on to
ask. "Would even the devil
have ever dreamed that so many
would come to sterilize their
own selves in the name of a
greater sense of responsibility
to the future and a greater
reverence for life 1"‘

Myopic Requirements

Hinder Blind Scholars

by BILL PYKUSH
Special to the Pitt News

Probation is bad news to any-
one. To a blind student it could
be the end of his college career.

College is rough enough with
eyesight. Try to find room 230

.CL if you can‘t even see the
Cathedral while standing on its
front lawn. Try reading three
chapters of sociology for the
next class when your're blind
and your reader quit that morn-
ing.

Blind students survive only
with the help of readers. tapes.
oral exams. and good friends.
The students are sponsored by
the Blind Association. The
Association pays for anything
the student can't afford. This
usually includes room and
board. tuition. books. and read-
er salary.

During the course of the
semester, there are many things
that could force a blind student
to take an incomplete, a with-
drawal, or a failing grade. Any
of these marks cancels his
sponsorship.

. The terms of the sponsorship

_ are strictly enforced. They‘ are

the maintenance of a 2.0 QPA.
and 15 or 16 credits a semester.
depending on the course of
study.

But without the help of the
Association. the blind student
would find it extremely dif-
ficult to finance his education
and extra services.

Many people devote their
time and money to educate the

blind. But the requirements for , 

their scholastic progress should
be the same as any other stu-
dent’s.

Track coach Jim Banner takes
three of his most talented ath
letes to Seattle with him next
week for the NCAA Collegiate
Track championships. The three-
day meet will mark the end to
this years outdoor season and

will mark the end of another suc— '

cessful year for Banner.

The last two times the track-
sters made the trip to the nation-
als they returned with eighth
place finishes. The most recent
.\'CAAs were in Detroit for the
recently concluded indoor season.
in which the Bannermen were
tied by Michigan. ‘

Despite a lot of extremely fine
performances by Pitt athletes all
season long. only Mike Schurko.
Bill Rea. and Dan Kouvolo have
managed to qualify for the cham-
pionship meet.

Regardless of the limited’
amount of manpower. Banner will
boast a lot of quality in Seattle.

'In the indoor season. Pitt was
led by Jerry Richey. who had a
hand in all of Pitt's nine points.

For the second year in a row. a member of the Panther base-

Terry Stokes. Panther shortstop. was selected by the Boston Red
Soxin the sixth round of Tuesdays draft. He was the 136th pick

Last year, pitcher George Medichwas chosen by the New York

Stokes, who is only a junior, hopes to sign in the next couple of
days, thereby forfeiting his eligibility f_or next spring’s Pitt games. ~

After spending the summer
playing in the minors. Terry will
return to finish his senior year.

“I’m very happy about it,” he
exclaimed, “they are a real

. good organization and I do know

that they need infielders.”

According to Stokes. at least
a half dozen other teams were in-
terested in procuring the rights
to him. Last weekend. he had a
tryout with the Cincinnati Reds.
and "they were interested in
me.“ Terry said. 

This past season. Stokes batted
around .320 -for the Panthers and
started each game at short. Last
year. he manned centerfield’ for
the mitters and ledthe team in
stolen bases.

The Pitt Panther football team

its pre-season practice camp this
year. «moving from the Alle-
gheny College field in Mead-
ville. Pa.. to the Johnstown cam-
pus of the University.

According to publicity direc-
tor Dean Billick. the move is be-
ing made. "in order to promote
interest in football on
branch campuses. “

The pre-season drills are slat-
ed 'to run from Thursday. Aug-

because they only will participate
in one event a piece with the ex-
ception of Rea who will partici-
pate in two.

It would be hard to imagine a
team championship for Pitt at the
nationals with only three contest-
ants. but scoring performances
by the three tracksters would
make the trip worthwhile.

“It would be pretty tough with
only three guys,” lamented Ban-
ner, “but they were the only
three who qualified.”

Schurko qualified in the steeple-
chase with an 8258.6 time at the
stadium against Temple. Schurko
had a fair performance in the
IC4A"s with a 9:1-1.0 due to a bad
start.

"Mikes capable of doing much
better than that." said Banner
afterwards. "hes already proven

. that."

‘Kouvolo, who has had a yo-yo
type year in the javelin throw
could possibly win with one of his
good efforts. When the weather
has been good, Kouvolo has won
big. The" weather has had "ill ef-
fects_'on him, but he has a very
powerful arm. In fact, in one of
the meets, Kouvolo arm threw the
javelin 227 feet because the foot-
ing was so bad. His strongest nef-
fort this year was 249 feet. Kou-
volo won the IC4A title for the
second straight year with a
heave of 224 feet.

Rea will be the most active of‘

efforts. Some of the most unsung heroes in the athletic world are

the trainers.

Roger McGill. Associate Trainer at the University of Pittsburgh
has risen above his relatively unheralded position to be recognized

as one of the better trainers in

the country. This recognition
comes with his selection. to the
team of corpsmen who will be
on "hand at the Pan American
Gamesﬁ

The Pan American Games.
which are the Western Hemis-
pheres equivalent of the Olym-
pics. will be contestedthis sum-
mer in Cali. Colombia. I" The
Games feature all the events that
are run in the summer ‘Olympics
and act more-or—less as a warm-

  
      
 
      
      
     
       
    
       
   
    
    
         
     
      
      
   
       
     

  

A

up for the countries in.North and
South America for the Olym-
piad.

McGill will be one of nine
back-up trainers that will assist
two head trainers who are ac-
companying the United States
Contingent. ,He will be primari-
ly concerned with America’s
baseball team. His interest in
baseball dates back to his days
at Pitt as an undergraduate, when
he played for the mitters. for
three years. _ '

McGill earned his Master of
Education degree in 1951 and
then went on to establish his car-
eer as a trainer. which he has

pursued now for 23 years. n

In 1963 he served as head
trainer for the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers. and then acted as the train-"
er for the Philadelphia 76ers.
the Detroit-Pistons. and the Los
Angelas Lak_ers. when they came
into Pittsburgh for basketball

competition.

This is the first time in Pitt"s
history that one of its trainers

I has been selected for the Pan

Am Games. This year marks the
Vlth running of the competition
and the Games, will run_t‘rornl

In the long jump, Rea is clos-
ing in on the 26 foot mark.

He broke the long existing Pitt
long jump record with a 35 ft.
7 inch jump and last week broke
that record with 25 ft. 9 ‘ 2 inches.

Once the tracksters arrive- in
Seattle. they will first have to
qualify for the trials. then qualify
in the trials to reach the finals.
They will be busy all weekend be-
fore hopefully making it to the
finals.

Banner would make no predic-
tions about his threesome, but he
is optimistic nonetheless.

"Even though they will face the
best competition in the country.
they all have a shot at winning.“

_ Chosen For
iHall Of Fame

Marigold "Goldie" Edwards.
associate professor of women‘s
physical education at Pitt. was
named to the Western Pennsyl-
vania Sports Hall of Fame.

This. is the first year for
women athletes to be nominated
to the Hall of Fame.

Dr. Edwards was selected be-
cause of her outstanding ability as
a squash player.

New Jersey State Squash Tourna-
ment played at Princeton and also
placed first in the Massachusetts
State Tournament at Boston.
Edwards was runner up in the
U.S. Nationals—giving her a num-
ber two ranking in the nation.

“I was quite pleased by my se-
lection to the - Sports Hall of
Fame," stated Edwards. 
eryone-—espe‘cial1y‘ in sports has
been so nice to me. Iguess thats

why I can't identify with women‘s -

lib."

plished ‘tennis player, will not be
idle this summer. She will be
playing for the Fox Chapel Club
and the “Pittsburgh Racket Club.
