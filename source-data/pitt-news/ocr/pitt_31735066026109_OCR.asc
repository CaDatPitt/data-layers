Students learn to use PiltCat and other computer systems in Freshman studies.

éI3.l.I&I/V\ :H\/ls‘ 2l3ON|llVQ l\lOSVf

F. studies stays an elective

Jason Gallinger
Staff Writer

Adam Neary found the freshman
studies course to be so worthwhile
that he is now a freshman studies
teaching assistant. /

“It helped me to feel comfortable
around other students and to get to
know some of them,” he said. “I
found out a lot about Pitt and the
administration.”

Neary, a senior political science
major, is in the midst of his fourth
semester as a freshman studies TA.
He said that as a TA he is able to help
other freshmen derive the same ben-
efits he got from the course.

“I get to meet other students,
work with them, and help them adapt
to a new environment and the issues
facing them,” he said.

With a success story like this to
boast of, it might seem ironic that
Pitt hasn’t made freshman studies a
required course for incoming stu-
dents. There are, however, argu-
ments both for and against making
the orientation class a requirement.

“I definitely think freshman

. studies should be required,” said

Nicholas Jones, a professor in the
classics department. Jones is teach-
ing the only freshman studies section
offered this spring.

He offered two reasons why he
thinks the course should be required.
First, he said it makes students aware
of the many opportunities available
at Pitt. “This huge institution” might
otherwise be overwhelming, he said.

Second, Jones said freshman
studies helps ease students’ transi-
tion from living at home to living in
a “very complex and diverse envi-
ronment.” He explained that some
students are from rural communities
or small towns and have no previous
experience that would prepare them
for Pitt’s urban environment. He

added that Pitt’s diversity could even
overwhelm some students from big
cities.

Freshman studies helps students
learn to use the library and computer
system, and also introduces students
to administration representatives.
During class discussions freshmen
wrestle with topics such as living
with roommates; issues of diversity
based on race, gender and sexual ori-
entation; alcohol and other con-
trolled substances; and date rape.

But Susan Harkins, head of the
freshman studies program, said a
large number of students take the
course, despite its not
required.

“Our advisers do a wonderful job
of steering students. toward the
class,” she said.

Harkins pointed out that 75 per-
cent of all freshmen take the course
and that enrollment has increased
each of the past five years.

According to Harkins, freshman
studies was a required course when it
was initiated 10 years ago but that
there was a problem.

“The faculty were not happy
with that,” she said. “They objected
to it being a graduation require-
ment.”

After one year as a required
course, the course’s status was
changed to “highly recommended.”
Because enrollment has been
increasing lately, Harkins said she
thinks the program is doing fine.

Jones said making freshman
studies a graduation requirement is a
more drastic change than he sup-
ports. He said he isn’t trying to hold
up anybody’s graduation but still
believes that all students should have
an orientation like freshman studies.

Economics Professor Herbert
Chesler has taught the class in the
past and expressed an opinion in

SMOKING

Iammarino’s right hand revealed the
intensity of his pack-and-a—half-a—day
habit.

The former three-sport high school
athlete said of his first cigarette, “A lot of
my friends were smoking one day and
they got me to try one. Now I smoke all
the time.”

Most young Americans’ foray into
smoking coincides with puberty, a transi-
tory time that leads teens to search for
what will allow them entry into young
adulthood. Unfortunately for a great
number of teens, that means smoking.

The underlying grip of puberty often
causes teens to break away from their
parents’ inﬂuential hold in search of an
identity. This sometimes means desiring
the company of peer groups or trying to
associate more closely with role models.

Now more than ever, though, the
people inﬂuencing schoolmates and
friends, brothers and sisters, are smokers.

The American Cancer Society esti-
mated that tobacco use is yearly responsi-
ble for 419,000 deaths —— more than one
in six — in the United States. More than
3,000 young people start smoking every
day —— over 1,000,000 each year. These
alarming numbers just magnify the long-
term consequences of smoking.

Those who begin smoking at an early
age multiply their risk of nicotine addic-
tion and smoking—related premature
death. Studies by the ACS show that
about 50 percent of the smokers who

begin when they are teenagers will even-
tually die from smoking, hacking 20 to 25
years from their life expectancies.

“The numbers are startling and
upsetting. It really makes me think about
quitting,” recent Pitt graduate and smok-
er Andrea Draper said of the study results.

Smokers have difﬁculty accepting

target the developing minds and lungs of
teens.

The R.J. Reynolds tobacco company
peddled particular types of cigarettes
directly to teenagers as young as 13, in a
plan to steal business away from Phillip
Morris’ Marlboros, its biggest competi-
tor.

A once-secret

1987 company
the consequences memo coded “RIR
that appear On the Secret,” revealed
side of every pack that the tobacco

of cigarettes sold
in the United
States.

Tobacco com-
panies, however,
have been accused
of working hard to
not only entice
young people into
the grip of nico-
tine addiction, but
also to tighten its
hold. They argue
that warning
labels pose a fruit-
less defense when
positioned against 
the deep—pocketed tobacco company
machine, driven by addiction and big
business.

While peer groups and role models
play perhaps an unknowing part in the
orchestration of teen and young adult
smoking, accusations stirred that tobacco
companies, with advertising budgets that
rival a sports team’s payroll, vigorously

company created a
“wider—circumfer—
ence nonmenthol
cigarette targeted at
young adult male
smokers [primarily
13 to 24-year-old

male Marlboro
smokers].” Camel
Wides eventually

entered the market.

Camel Wides,
hocked by the sun-
glass—clad, hip car-
toon character Joe
Camel, targeted
teens despite RJ
Reynold’s constant denials. The Joe
Camel character was first introduced in
France in the mid-’70s, and eventually
hopped a plane for America.

In 1987, after a successful entry into
the competitive teen and college-age
smoking market, Camel grew like a weed
to the No. 2 brand of cigarettes among
teens. Only the ruggedly handsome cow-

3

boys of Marlboro were able to persuade
more young people to smoke.

President Clinton, among others, has
taken up the struggle to prevent cigarettes
from reaching the hands of students. His
goal is to cut tobacco use by teenagers in
half and also to prevent them from start-
ing. The president gave the Food and
Drug Administration the authority to reg-
ulate cigarettes because of their nicotine
content.

The president’s proposed regulations
to impede underage smoking include
requiring tobacco companies to pay for a
$150 million advertising campaign to
stop young people from smoking, requir-
ing proof—of-age to buy tobacco products,
as well as prohibiting tobacco advertising
billboards within 1,000 feet of schools
and playgrounds.

The president’s concern may have
come just in time. University of Michigan
researchers found that of 2,000 high
school seniors polled, 30 percent reported
that they had their first cigarette in or
before sixth grade. More than 50 percent
surveyed revealed they believed there
were no health consequences, or only
mild health consequences from smoking.
The R.J. Reynolds family, however diffi-
cult to admit, would disagree.

R.J. Reynolds, who began manufac-
turing cigarettes at the turn of the century,
died from lung cancer after smoking his
entire adult life. His son and grandson,
R.J. Reynolds Jr. and R.J. Reynolds IH,
each died from emphysema, a disease
which left them short of breath, sick and
frail, also after a lifetime smoking habit.

stark contrast to that of Jones’.

“I would not recommend that
freshman studies be required,”
Chesler said.

He said there is variety in the
way professors teach the class.
There is, he said, no quality control
to ensure that all sections are taught
in the same way.

“When courses are required,
there is an inherent expectation for

‘ some quality standard,” Chesler

said. To reconfigure the course so it
is always taught the same way
would present a logistical problem
and thus would not be feasible, ‘he

‘ explained.

While Chesler said he feels the
course is useful to students who are
very new to the academic environ-
ment and not “sufficiently mature”
to function “without angst” away
from home, he said some students
come to Pitt with more experience
than others. V

“Students who are more pre-
pared will equate this course with a
waste of time,” he said.

Chesler said he would prefer to
keep freshman studies the way it is.

“The course is explained to the
students and their parents, and that
way an informed decision is made,”
he said.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. — Investigators are
checking into the "death of a South Whitehall

the township manager’s oﬂice.

The incident occuned as police oﬂicers
held a training session on hostage negotia-
tions a few feet away.

Lehigh County District Attorney James
Martin said 59-year-old Kenneth Adams
shot himself soon after arriving at Gerry
Gasda’s office at 11:40 am Friday.

Martin said Adams told Gasda after dis-
playing a .38-caliber revolver". “Don’t wony,
I’m not going to do you, I’m going to do
me.”

Adams was owner of Adams Glass and
Aluminum in Allentown. He sued South
Whitehall in August 1996, claiming he had
been permanently disabled seven months
earlier by a township snowplow.

WASHINGTON — Kathleen Wlley has

encounter with President Clinton.

In an interview with CBS’ “60
Minutes,” Willey said she “could not believe
the recklessness” of Clinton groping her as
she was discussing her fan1ily’s imminent
ﬁnancial disaster.

In sworn testimony, Willey said Clinton
put his arms around her, tried to kiss her on
the lips, then placed her hands on his geni-
tals. She said she pushed him away.

Clinton has denied any sexual
encounter but said he may have kissed her
on the forehead to comfort her.

President Patricia Ireland said on CNN that
if it’s true, it’s sexual assault

But Clinton’s lawyer, Robert Bennett,

Military conduct
rules must be strict

Sgt. Maj. Gene C- McKinney, the Army's
highest ranking enlisted man, was acquitted of 18
of 19 charges at a court-martial last week.

A jury of eight — four military ofﬁcers and
four enlisted soldiers — exonerated McKinney of

many offenses that would not be crimes in the

civilian world, including several charges of sexu-
al misconduct. The only charge of which it did
ﬁnd McKinney guilty was obstruction of justice
—— sentencing for which is expected to be light
will be directed this week. ’
Jurors, as is the practice with courts-martial,

did not comment publicly on the case. VV1thout K

knowing more details of the proceedings, it would
be unfair to praise or criticize the outcome.

But we can still appreciate the fact that a trial
was held. Many in the military believe cases like
this are often dismissed quietly to protect senior
ofﬁcers. Hopefully, this was not just a "show
trial," as McKinney's lawyer has described it, for
the military to Venerate itself following a series of
sexual-misconduct cases in recent times. The n1il—
itary must be vigilant in upholding its internal law.

It may seem unfair to some that military om-
cers should have a stricter law than the rest of us,
especially when they read that one of the charges
brought against McKinney was maltreatment of a
staff member by "repeatedly calling her and ask-
ing her to come for drinks to the hotel room where
he was staying." But there is good reason for such
strict rules of conduct. ’

The Uniform Code of Military Justice pro-
vides a system of rules of conduct to which mili-
tary ofﬁcers must adhere. The idea of having a
much stricter code than civilian law provides is to
maintain order in the ﬁghting forces and to pre-
vent abuse of power by those who are highly
ranked.

Such abuses of power would be all too easy in
our military's hierarchical system. Allowed to run
rampant, those abuses could destroy the very fab-
ric of what makes a cohesive ﬁghting unit: trust-
ing your fellow soldiers.

Surely few of us would feel comfortable
putting the protection of our country and our lives
into the hands of people who eat, breath, train and
ﬁght together 24 hours a day but who could not be
trusted to protect each other's rights and ﬁeedoms.

The Pitt News

When politics gets in theway of education

Marc Nuzzo
columnlst ’

A pair of Pitt Law School profes-
sors, William Luneburg and Jules
Lobel, recently won an injunction for a
group of students from Clarion
University. The injunction has halted a
major clear—cutting -logging project in
the Allegheny National Forest.
Because the Clarion environmental
group, called the Allegheny Defense
Project, can't alford legal representation
in its two separate suits against the
state, the Pitt professors are prosecuting

. the case pro bono on behalf of the stu-

dents.

Enter conﬂict.

State Sens. Wrlliarn Slocum and
Dan Surra have launched an assault on
Luneburg and Lobel for their work,
under the auspices that the two teachers
— employed by a state—re1ated institu-
tion — are adversely affecting their dis-
tricts. Slocum claims the halt has put
$2.7 million in tax revenues in limbo in
his region and threatens a total $11 rnil—
lion loss if the project is ultimately
nixed. According to an article in last
week's issue of the Pittsburgh City
Paper, Slocum is sending a letter, inde-
pendently of Surra, to the University
calling for "disciplinary action" to be

taken against the profs.

And that's where the senator's
political ballyhoo goes too far. \V1th all
due respect, Mr. Senator, you display a

- lot more nerve than common sense.

There exists a certain aura of sanc-
tity around the democratic educational
institution. The American university is
a place where people come together to
exchange ideas and debate concepts -
without the fear of reprisal. To say that

elfective learning can be done without‘

looking at how theory works in real—life
situations is the equivalent of attempt-
ing to complete a marathon with one

leg tied behind your back
Youcantryit,butI'dhatetobein
your shoe.
Instructors are and should be able

-to, unfettered, teach how the concepts

based in books on dusty shelves surge
into motion as part of the way things
really operate.

Both Luneburg and Lobel — who
teach environmental and constitutional
law, respectively —— are involved in a
case that they can now bring into their
classrooms ﬁrst hand They are able to
demonstrate to their students the real-
life dodge-and-parry tactics behind
their court room irnbroglio against the
logging industry and the state.

As an example of one such politi-
cal maneuver being ,used, Sens.
Slocum and Surra have chastised the
Pitt lawyers for the accidental use of
University letterhead for one of the let-
ters they sent in the _case, saying the let-
terhead implies Pitt's support of the pro-
fessors' side. Luneburg has repeatedly
stated that the use of Pitt letterhead was
never intended and concedes that it was
a mistake. It was, after all, one letter
among thousands of pages of legal pro-
ceedings, paperwork and pleadings.

For all intents and purposes,

T Slocum is attacking the Pitt duo for a

slip—up and a petty technicality. The let-
ter from Slocum (who sits on the
Commonwealth's Appropriations
Committee and decides what Pitt will
receive from the state each year) to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg request-

ing punishment is undeniably a pre- '

meditated assault on a sacred institu-
tion.

The University has, and rightfully
so, oﬂicially stated that it is taking no
side in this matter. Pitt spokesman Ken
Service did go as far to say in the City
Paper article that the University "does
support the faculty's effort to remain
current in their area of expertise." If Pitt

THE PITT NEWS

were to sidewith a party, it would log-
ically follow that an institution holding
this View — and which regularly
encourages its members to donate
community service to the people of our
state —— would support its instructors in
these pursuits. '

Coupled with the fact that lawyers
are encouraged by the American Bar
Association to perform a certain
amount of pro bono work each year,
the audacity of Slocum to suggest that
these professors should be punished for
their work becomes‘ even less palatable.

These Pitt law school professors
are meeting their responsibilities as
both lawyers and educators. In an age
when lawyers are often on the receiv-
ing end of moral and ethical criticism,
Slocum is suggesting ﬂogging those
who are doing their part to maintain
what is undeniably good of the legal
profession.

Slocum has — and, arguably,
rightfully so — the interests of his
ﬁnancial backers inﬂuencing his

actions. He owes his loyalty to those’

who put him in his oﬁicial post and
fund him Nevertheless, this does not
give him any right to thrust his pork-
laden belly of inﬂuence into the acade-
mic world. It is one thing to oppose and
criticize the actions of others in the bat-
tleﬁeld of state politics. It is quite anoth-
er to lose sight of what your limits as an
elected official are and overstep your
boundaries.

The political playground bullies
would do well to back off and apolo-
gize for suggesting that the Pitt profes-
sors should be punished. At this point
the senators should simply let the pro-
fessionals — or at least those who act
professionally — handle this case.

A message to

cily planners:
Let it "B "

The Regional Renaissance
Initiative’s destruction last
November by Allegheny and sur-
rounding counties was the worst
whipping since Bush vs. Dukakis.

In the blowout, the public fer-
vently cried out against a l—percent
sales tax hike and, in the process,
dampened the dreams of one—sport
stadiums for the Pirates and Steelers.

Move ahead to early Februar
1998. '

In a political move that could
spotlight Mayor Tom Murphy as the
savior of Pittsburgh’s sports being,
the mayor and his advisers have
devised a Plan B for funding and
building new stadiums.

Once again Murphy has side-
kicks-slash-County Commissioners
Bob Cranmer and Mike Dawida
backing him, just like when Murphy
spoke in favor of the Initiative.

These guys are really smart.

They realized people don’t like
taxes. 0

McDonald’s advertises 99 cent
Big Macs, but you can’t buy one
with just a dollar.

You make $200 a week, but after
taxes are stripped it hovers around
$160.

And the tax those weeny IRS
guys take never equals your expect-
ed refund.

Murphy and Co. took the obvi-
ous distaste‘ for taxes into account
and drafted a new plan with less

_ public funding, no tax increases and

greater contributions from the indi-
vidual teams.

And, the best part of all is, there
won’t be a vote.

So, you anti-development, anti-
vision, anti—sports and anti-
Pittsburgh fossils can’t screw it all
up.

The proposed $803 million will
be raised by a $305 million bond
issue, if passed by city and county
officials. Gov. Tom Ridge, in words
only, has pledged a reported $328
million to the project which also
includes the expanding of the David
L. Lawrence Convention Center. The
Pirates and Steelers are each being
asked to up their antes along with
other private commitments to bring
in the remaining $170 million.

Back to work for anther fooball

Rachel Lenzi
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team
is back in business.

After a long winter of
meetings, individual train-
ing, and the departure of
16 seniors, Head Coach
Walt Harris has assembled
his troops for the begin-
ning of spring drills.

Thursday’s opening
workout came after Coach
Harris’ decision to delay
the start of practice by two
days, due to the decline in
his players’ conditioning
over spring break.

“I wasn’t happy  ,”
Harris said after the work-
out. “But they got the mes-
sage and picked it up on
Tuesday, had a real good
workout on Wednesday
and we decided that we

explained. “But the bulk of
the team was done on

we did [before spring
break]. It was rough. It’s a
physical grind.”

   

The Panthers took over
the Cost Center Thursday

Sounds great.

The bond issue will be paid for
with a re-allocation of the Regional
Asset District and Public Auditorium
Authority taxes. This shouldn’t be
too difficult because the members of
those committees are appointed b
Cranmer and Dawida. -

Whata fabulous idea. Instead of
raising taxes, just use the tax monies
already existing. That way there’s no
crying from the common folk that
$50 a year (what the Initiative reso-
lution would have cost the average
family per year) is too much.

Now. all the wheels are in place.

sports era.

But wait, there’s that buck-
toothed monster blocking the road to
improvement again.

It’s Larry “I don’t want anything
ever to get”'Dunn. Yes, he’s back
spouting his exaggerated lies again.
He, of course, opposes Plan B, say-
ing its just a rich-get-richer scheme

that doesn’t help his constituents.‘
_Dunn has once again convinced his

supporters that Plan B has the same
faults as A and a possibility of a C,
would be like the Plan B after A.
Makes sense  doesn’t it? Way
to go Larry.
Would someone please, please
put cement shoes in his Easter bas-

' ket? No  just kidding.

Dunn aside, Plan B can simply
improve Pittsburgh. First, this plan

causes no more added economic
stress to the area’s working class —
the legislation’s greatest quality.
Second, new stadiums for the Pirates
and Steelers would be monumental
steps in regaining a dominant
Pittsburgh sports scene.

The Steelers have a rising star at
quarterback in Kordell Stewart and
an incredible defense, (see
Bradshaw, Terry and the Steel
Curtain). They have the core of a
possible dynasty, but the continual
economic hardships they encounter
in the off-seasons will never allow
that to happen.

The Bucs have a mountain of tal-
ent and a 21-year-old Dominican
right fielder, Jose Guillen, who
draws some comparisons to Pirate
great Roberto Clemente. But, just

like Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla,
Guillen could soon leave for more
money because the Pirates can’t
afford him.

It’s frustrating.

What could have been if the
Pirates and Steelers would have kept
all their free—agent runaways?

These new stadiums can solve
the problem. Look at the Cleveland
Indians and Jacobs Field. They don’t
have an incredible TV contract, it’s
their stadium revenues that enables
them to re-sign superstar Kenny
Lofton and compete for the World
Series the past three years.

Pessimists think a Cleveland
Indian thing could never happen in
Pittsburgh, but why not? Let’s give
these teams new stadiums and the
chance to keep their home—grown tal-
ent.

And then we can see what kind of
sports town Pittsburgh can really be.

editor for the Pitt News.

like it at times, but that’s understand-
able.”

“Starting from scratch” isn’t
quite the term to describe the begin-
ning of spring drills, as a large per-
centage of last year’s underclassmen
returned to the turf on Tuesday after-
noon.

But Harris is heavily relying on
newcomers to the Pitt football team
— including a promising quarterback
recruit, transfer players who began
their studies at Pitt this semester, and
numerous walk-on players — to fill
the void left by the 16 departures. «-

“It’s up to the new guys to step up
and get the job done,” Harris stated.

One of those new performers
includes quarterback Matt O’Conner,
a transfer from Saddleback
Community College _in Mission
Viejo, Calif.

O’Conner is competing for the
starting-quarterback position with
returnees Matt Lytle and Tony
Zimmerman. All three quarterbacks
took snaps during Thursday’s prac-
tice, but Harris would not comment
on any decisions regardingthe spring
quarterback situation.

However, Harris announced that
a fourth quarterback, John Turman,
who is transferring from Los
Medamos College in Pittsburg,
Calif., will be competing for a start-
ing spot on the fall roster.

“John Turman has been promised
an opportunity to see if he can per-
form,” said Harris.

The football team has this after-
noon off and will practice Tuesday at
2:30 p.m., but the location is still to
be determined based on weather con-
ditions. -

Pill baseball loses two games
to snow, will make up one

Matt Mento
Staff Writer

The returning winter weather
blew into Ohio this weekend, post-
poning the Pitt baseball team’s
three—game set with Ohio State. A

‘ snowstorm tore through Columbus

at the end of last week, freezing the
Buckeye home field.

Two of the three games will be
played as a doubleheader on
Thursday, May 7. The third will not
be rescheduled, according to Pitt
officials. '

The team used the extra time by
preparing for an intercity battle
with Duquesne University this
Wednesday.

“The team has been working
really hard, making solid adjust-
ments,”
Jordano. “They have become refo-
cused since our spring break trip.”

Last season, Pitt split the season

series with the Dukes by dropping .

the first two and winning the final
pair.

Pitt and Duquesne have a ten-
dency to score runs in the double
digits against each other — in their
first contest last season, the Dukes

said Head Coach ‘Joe

won by a touchdown, 14-7. The
Dukes also won a low-scoring affair
in the second game.

But Pitt fought back strong later
in the season, winning 12-10 in the
third game and outshooting the
Dukes 19-18 in the fourth and final
meeting’. .

This season’s Panthers ente
Wednesday’s game with a 3-6
record earned in over spring break.
The Duquesne game will be the first
contest for Pitt outside the state of
Florida.

Junior second baseman Charles
Stafford leads the team in batting
after the first nine contests, batting
.500 in three games played. Junior
outfielder Jason Oliver is second in
batting with a .350 average in seven
games played.

Senior pitcher Bob Balazentis
leads the hurlers with a 1.29 ERA
despite his one loss this season in
seven innings pitched. Kevin
Lazeski is second in pitching with a
1.69 ERA and one victory under his
belt.

Pitt will play Duquesne at 2
p.m. on Wednesday afternoon at
Trees Field, which is located behind
the Cost Center. Admission is free.

2 seed, Davis beat Russ and Abby
Vens 9-8 for win No. 111.

After the match, Davis was
pleased with her victories and, with
urging from Head Coach George
Dieffenbach, spoke
about the record she
is fast approaching. A

“I want to break
the record, and after
I do that, it would
be nice to win a few
more and keep those
wins on top to make
my record stand,”
Davis said. “There
are 10 matches left. ,
To win five is very
reasonable.” Pitt’s
all-time record of
116 is held by Julie ..
LoPrinzi.

Shalbrack, how-
ever, had a tougher _ _ _
time facing Shana  
Young in singles play. In the
longest of the six singles matches,
No.—4 seeded Young took Shalbrack
the distance, but it was Shalbrack
who won the battle of attrition, tak-
ing the match, 6-3, 6-3.

Top-seeded Dana Jafarian lost

her match against Vens, 6-4, 6-2,
and despite a valiant doubles effort
with Lindsay Carlson, the top-seed-
ed doubles team couldn’t take down
Youngstown State’s Young and
Mary Hall, losing the match 9-8.

No.-2 seed Carlson defeated
Hall in singles play, 7-5, 6-2, while
