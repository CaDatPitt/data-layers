Unconfirmed reports

MOSCOW (UPI) -
A Washington Post
report from Switzerland
said Vice President
Bush, who is in Geneva,
received unconfirmed
reports last night that
Soviet President Kon-
stantin U. Chernenko
has died.

Visits by high-ranking
Soviet officials to the
United States and
Yugoslavia being cut
short on Sunday, com-
bined with Soviet radio
programming somber
music rather than a sche-
duled talk show, fueled
speculation that a top
Kremlin leader, proba-
bly President Cher-
nenko, is dead.

Rumors about the 73-
year-old 1eader’s illness
have been rampant’ since
he failed to appear for

the December funeral of
Defense Minister Dmi-
try Ustinov. They gained
momentum since Fri-
day, when unofficial
sources said Chernenko
died.

Politburo member
Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
in his early 50s, is consi-
dered by western ana-
lysts to be Chernenko’s
most-likely successor.

Chernenko ascended
to the presidency of the
Soviet Union, it is
believed, as a comprom-
ise candidate, the choice
of “old guard” power
brokers such as Ustinov
and Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko. Cher-
nenko was a protege of
Gromyko. _

Chernenko dropped
out of sight last year

from February to May,
missing Soviet May Day
celebrations and stimu-
lating rumors of ill
health. His death may
bring to an end the tradi-
tion of older Politburo
men (in their 70s) con-
trolling Soviet leader-
ship and direction.

Gorbachev, a lawyer
and agronomist, is con-
sidered something of an
economic reformer. He
has traveled frequently
to the West. Sources in
Moscow reveal that he
served as chairman at
Politburo meetings in
Chernenko’s abscences.

If reports of Chernen-
ko’s death are proved to
be correct, he will have
died one year, one
month and one day after
his predecessor, Yuri
Andropov.

Novelist defines good

literature in lecture at Pitt

By Dan Mottsman
The Pitt News

World renowned novelist Chaim
Potok spoke Thursday evening in a
lecture sponsored by the Pitt Hillel
Club. Potok is the author of such
books as “The Promise” and “The
Chosen,” the latter of which became
a motion picture. _

Potok focused his lecture on liter-
ature and the human experience,
saying that good literature addresses
“core cultural conflicts” that form
when an individual encounters the
alien ideas of another individual or
group. His novels, drawn from his
own Jewish experiences — espe-
cially from his youth — deal with
these collisions of ideas.

Potok grew up in New York City
in a Hassidic Jewis religious envi-
ronment. He attended a Jewish
parochial school in which almost all
of his readings were limited to sacred
Jewish religious texts. He felt re-

stricted by the narrow spectrum of
his studies and hungered for litera-
ture outside that of his orthodox

eral American Credits.

Students should establish a good credit
rating, according to the president of Gen-

religious upbringing. Potok pres-
ents a similar scenario involving
Danny Saunders in “The Chosen.”

While in high school, Potok
became intensely interested in
serious modern western fiction,
finding in these novels new horizons
of experience. Ironically, the novel
that Potok said influenced him the
most as a child was Evelyn Waugh’s
“Brideshead Revisited,” which cen-
ters around a Catholic British fam-
ily. For Potok, it was the first novel
that “engulfed me and put me inside
the world of the novel." It was the
beginning of his commitment to
writing novels.

At one time, Potok told his
mother that he wanted to be a writer.
As he remembers, his mother rep-
lied, “You’ll be a brain surgeon; you
can write novels on the side."

' Potol/(‘s parents and school
instructors were displeased with his
interest in reading and writing sto-
ries; they felt that it took him away
from his religious studies. Potok
claimed that this core cultural con-
frontation between his Hassidic
Jewish identity and his newly found
passion for modern literature
created within him a tension that

fueled his desire to be a writer.

In effect, Potok became ordained
as a rabbi and later earned a Ph.D.
in secular philosophy. Potok
explained that throughout his life he
has remained strong in his Jewish
faith and identity while benefiting
from his studies in and experiences
within secular culture —- especially
with respect to the novel.

Potok claims that the novel is a
central facet of western man. He
characterizes modern literature as
“iconoclastic” and possessing
“binocular vision. ” He said, “Litera-
ture can focus in on and reveal the
individual in his nakedness so that
he might change.” ’

Addressing the students in the
audience, Potok stated that he
expected that any young,reader of
serious western literature inevitably
will face a conflict between his own
cultural values and those presented
in the novel. If the reader is inﬂu-
enced by the novel, he comes into
conflict with the values of his own
society, Potok said.

According to Potok, the manner
in which the individual deals with‘
this conflict is crucial. If society wins

Aide explains crisis
in Central America

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Most Americans’ understanding
of the crisis in Central America is
“not at all great,” said White House
aide Robert Reilly, who spoke
Friday at Point Park College in
Pittsburgh.

Reilly, the special assistant for
public liaison, said that “anyone
 foolish to think they
could understand what is taking
place there [Central America]
without understanding the role it
plays as a component in Soviet
global strategy.”

The strategy, he later explained, is
based on the ideals of Marxism-
Leninism. He defined the ideals as
“not simply another political
system. It is a pseudo-religious
enterprise bent upon the
metaphysical restructuring of reality
itself," he said. “At the end, the party

must control every aspect of life in
order to effect this transformation.”

Reilly pointed out that the Soviets
have been using their strategy to
seek control of the Caribbean Sea
and Central America.

To explain the vulnerability of the
United States, Reilly focused on the
five principal sea lanes that pass

through the Caribbean and the Gulf-

of Mexico. Fifty percent of U.S.
imports and exports, he said, pass
through the five lanes. Also 75
percent of all U.S.-imported oil
passes through those lanes.

“Now you can see, with the near
acquisition of Grenada by the Soviet
Union through their Cuban
surrogates, the Soviet Union was in
the rather extraordinary position of
being physically contiguous to four
out of the five critical sea lanes,”
Reilly said. '

“And with the consolidating
Marxist-Leninist revolution in
Nicaragua,” he said, “the Soviet
Union comes very close to

Child abuse laws
discussed at meeting

By Karen Frost
The Pitt News

State legislation aimed at curbing
child abuse was discussed Friday at
a public hearing in the Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Union.

Rep. David W. Sweet, chairman
of the House subcommittee on crime
and corrections, and Rep. David J.
Mayernick listened to a variety of
witnesses who presented testimony
on pending bills and a new state law
(Act 244). Act 244, requires
background checks for all potential
employees who would work with
children to verify that no child abuse
charges have been ﬁled against
them. »

“There still is a substantial
unfinished agenda remaining for
those who agree that our child abuse
laws need improvement,” Sweet
said. He listed a series of issues for
committee action in the coming
months, including the new
background check law. This law
would require employers to procure
an affidavit from state police stating
that job applicants have not been
charged with child abuse. The
affidavit and application would then
be sent to Social Services to be
reviewed.

Clark Luster, representative of
the Western Region of the
Pennsylvania Council of Voluntary
Child Care Agencies, voiced
concerns about Act 244. He said that
the law still needs to address the

timeliness of securing background
checks, the cost of checking, and
liability and civil rights issues.

Mayernick agreed that the new
law needs careful re-examination,
with tightening of some provisions,
and must be amended to bring
Pennsylvania into compliance with
recent federal enactments.

Sweet also said that legislation
providing some courtroom
protections for children involved in
abuse cases must be adopted.
Governor Thornburgh vetoed a bill
on this matter late last year because
he objected to an unrelated
amendment. “New legislation is

needed to help lessen the trauma a,

child confronts in the pressure
cooker of a courtroom," Sweet said.
“Certainly, an abused child should
not have to withstand any more
additional pressure than our legal
system absolutely requires.”

Incarceration and treatment of
compulsive child abusers will be
examined by legislators, according
to Sweet, as well as funding for law
enforcement, state agencies and
county agencies responsible for the
implementation of these measures.
“Legislation must be followed by
sufficient ﬁnancial commitments,”
Sweet said.

Mayernick believes that
Pennsylvania is leading the nation in
trying to introduce this legislation.
He said that the public hearings
being held across the state have
educated lawmakers on various
problems with the legislation and
have also generated many
suggestions for improving it.

Engineers Week celebration

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Attention engineers! It’s time to
take your pencil packs out of your
pockets, put down your calculators,
protractors, and mechanical pencils
 and have fun! Yesterday marked
the beginning of Engineering Week
at the University of Pittsburgh.

Since 1954, Pitt has considered
this week of games and charity
drives as one ofits major events. The
tradition began in 1903 at the Uni-
versity of Missouri. A group of engi-
neering students decided they
needed a vacation from a long win-
ter of books and classes. The inspira-
tion to celebrate during the week of
St. Patrick's Day came from one stu-
dent’s notion that it was St. Patrick
who drove the snakes from Ireland,
creating the first worm drive, which
signified that he was an engineer.

In celebration, the engineers cut
their St. Patrick’s Day classes to
engage in various activities. The two
organizers of the events were
expelled from the university, but the-
tradition continued and Engineering
Day was expanded to Engineering
Week.

Pitt’s Engineering Week started
yesterday with an Open House and
will continue through Friday. The
theme this year is “countries.”

The students are divided into
eight teams, according to the type of
engineering they are involved in -
chemical, civil, electrical, industrial,
mechanical, metallurgical and min-
ing. Freshman engineers, who have
not yet specialized, are the eighth
team. The teams compete, and
awards are given at the end of the
week. Classes are even canceled on
Thursday and Friday.

The objectives of the week are to

“Pitt doesn't have a spring break,"
said Mark Cairns, the vice president
of the Engineering Student Cabinet.
“So this is our spring break - two

Yesterday’s Open House was—the
time for parents to see, what their
future engineers are actually learn-
ing and for the students to show off
their departments through slide
shows, demonstrations and
displays.

The week continues with a blood
drive from I0a.m. to4p.m. Monday
and Tuesday at Benedum Hall.
Tuesday night is “Enginuity,” an
event that tests engineering talents.
Team members are given a problem

triangulating the Caribbean.” Reilly
believes that this poses a great threat
to the United States.

Reilly also expressed concern
over the large military buildup in
Nicaragua that has escalated since
the Sandinistas assumed control of
the government in l979. Aided by
the Soviet Union and several Soviet-
bloc countries, including Cuba and
East Germany, Reilly said, the
Sandinistas have

publicly

announced their intentions to
increase their army from 120,000
troops (including the militia and
reserves) to 200,000 by the end of
this year.

Also, a large airstrip is being built
outside of Managua, the capital city
of Nicaragua, according to Reilly,
which is capable of accommodating

even the largest Soviet military .

aircraft. “Not even they pretend that
it ‘is just a tourist facility," Reilly
said.

Reilly added that the airport will
finally give the Soviet Union
something that it has long sought
but never had before A the ability to
survey the west coast of the United
States, including the Silicon Valley,
where high-technology military
research is going on.

Despite the contentions by
Sandinista officials that the military
buildup is in response to “Yankee
imperialism,” Reilly said that the
United States believes the buildup is

a fulfillment of the historic mission
of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front.

As further evidence of the
Sandinistas, Reilly explained, a
reporter from Playboy Magazine
interviewed Nicaragua‘s minister of
the interior. According to Reilly, the
reporter asked the following
question: “Will you respond to the
remark that Nicaragua is the first
domino in Latin America — that
since the revolution was started
here, it will be exported to El
Salvador, then Guatemala, then
Honduras, then Mexico?”

The minister responded, “That is
one historical prophecy of Ronald
Reagan's that is absolutely true." He
concluded by adding, “And Costa
Rica is the dessert."

Reilly said that as the Sandinistas
create havoc in Central America, he
fears the U.S. will be faced with a
large refugee problem. He believes
approximately two-and-a-half mil-
lion people would flock to America.

“Between the Rio Grande and the
Panama Canal, there are 100 million
people, and if the Sandinistas ever
succeeded in their ultimate objective
of destabilizing Mexico itself, that
two-and-a-half million people
would indeed be just a drop in the
ocean,” Reilly said.

Pointing out the crisis in Florida
several years ago when thousands of
Cuban boat people brought
temporary chaos to Florida, Reilly
illustrated the effectiveness of
refugees as a weapon the Sandinistas
might use against the U.S.

Nicaraguans today have no
freedom of assembly, no freedom of
the press, and the churches are
censored, Reilly continued. He
explained that Nicaraguans
cooperate with the Sandinistas only
as a matter of survival.
Commodities are rationed to those
who have ration cards. The cards are
apparently given only to those who
are loyal to the Sandinistas. Private
property is confiscated, and free
labor trade unions are suppressed,

he said. *
Reilly also said there is much
religious persecution. Jews ﬂed, and
the synagogue was taken over by the
Sandinistas and covered with anti-
Semitic graffiti. Over’20 Catholic
churches have allegedly been
attacked by Sandinista mobs. Other
churches, he said, have been
infiltrated by priests who undermine
the true theology of the church.
Reilly also related stories of
actions by the Sandinistas against
church clergy. He told of a preacher
who was allegedly taken by the
Sandinistas and had his ears cut off.
They then bashed his head in with a
riﬂe butt and cut his throat, Reilly
said. This man lived, however, and
eventually went to the United States.

In a question-answer session after
Reilly’s lecture, several members of
the audience loudly disputed his
claims. One woman confronted
Reilly with evidence that she
claimed proved him wrong. After
much heated discussion, other
members of the audience asked her
to sit down.

Reilly said her feelings were
induced by the moral confusion
created by the Sandinistas.

Reilly, in conclusion, supported
Reagan’s upcoming proposal for
more aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua. He said he believed that
if aid was not continued, the
resistance would dry up, groups

would have to deal with the
Sandinistas to survive and El
Salvador could be infiltrated,

enlarging the size of the Sandinista
National Liberation Front.

‘‘If this happens,” Reilly said, “if
Central America begins to unravel
completely, if they then begin to
have some success at destabilizing
Mexico itself  the danger to the
United States will be sufficiently
clear that the president will have to
act. By allowing it to get to that
point, there will only be one option
that the president could deploy, and
that would be direct intervention.”

Bureaucratic Blackmail

The Port Authority of Allegheny County announced Friday
that proposed cutbacks in service would not be sufficient to
avert a financial crisis. So when funds run out in June, the PAT
board plans to shut down the entire system unless additional
money is found.

Welcome to the wonderful world of bureaucratic blackmail.
This announcement is nothing more than an attempt to extort a
transit tax to subsidize the public transit system of the county.
The attempt is quite likely to succeed.

A private corporation, having no recourse to the taxpayer’s
pocketbook, would be negotiating earnestly with its unions for
wage concessions. That will not happen with PAT because the
taxpayer is an easier target than union bosses.

A private corporation also would be taking a hard look at
allegations of fraud and mismanagement. A state senate com-
mittee is currently investigating these allegations. Mismanage-
ment seems to be taken for granted when it comes to tax
dollars. '

Instead of introspectively examining the way PAT spends
money, its board of directors has decided to hold the transit
system hostage. It’s our way or no way at all is what the Port
Authority seems to be telling the people of Allegheny County.

Now, perhaps that isn’t a bad idea after all. Of course it
would be hard at first. Many people and businesses depend on
the service provided by PAT. But in time, privately owned
businesses would spring up to meet the demand for transporta-
tion. They would providejobs to the hundreds of area unem-
ployed who would gladly work for a fraction of what is now
paid to PAT bus drivers and maintenance workers. The man-
agement of these private businesses would have to be responsi-
ble fiscally, because they would be out ofajob ifthe company is
not profitable.

But this is an unlikely scenario. After much weeping and
wailing and gnashing ofteeth, state and local governments will
arrive at some solution to the budget crisis facing the transpor-
tation system. They have no choice, for if PAT were to cease

* functioning, politicians would have to answertotheir constitu-

ents at the polls next election. Whatever the solution, it will be
the taxpayers who will foot the bill once again.

This is not to say that a transit tax is necessarily bad. PAT
fares are among the highest in the country, since most other
metropolitan areas subsidize their transit systems through
some kind of tax.

But it is one thing to institute a tax in order to lower fares and
quite another to make the taxpayer responsible for fraud,
mismanagement and inflated wages.

If a transit tax is the only way to maintain mass transporta-
tion in Allegheny County, let us make it contingent upon wage
concessions and the changing of PAT’s management from an
appointed to an elected board answerable to the electorate.

The issue of South Africa is not a
black issue but an issue of human
dignity and as such should be an
issue of concern to all people, just as
the issue of Soviet Jewry is notjust a
Jewish issue.

I have been informed of a similar
issue on campus that also demands a
rejection of -quiet diplomacy, a
rejection of partisanship and
demands a clear, unequivocal
condemnation by all students,
faculty and staff. What I am
referring to is the Black Action
Society’s attempt to use student
activity fees to bring Louis
Farrakhan to Pitt.

The powers that be, both in the
university and in the Jewish
community —— more specifically,
Rabbi Levine of the Hillel
Foundation and the United Jewish
Federation — have called for quiet
diplomacy and sought to keep the
students uninformed of the BAS’
intentions. I reject this. This is
primarily a student issue, and the
students must speak out loudly and
unequivocally in condemning the
intentions and lack of sensitivity of
the Black Action Society. No
purpose could possibly be served by
giving him a platform at Pitt, let
alone funding his appearance with
student activity fees, other than the
propagation of hate.

This request, by one of the
campus’ most respected student
organizations, the Black Action
Society, has taken the Jewish
students totally by surprise and can
only signify the dismal, perhaps
irreparable, state of the once-close
historic black/Jewish coalition.
This action ostensibly condones
anti-Semitism, a form of racism, and
lends a hollow ring to the BAS' calls
for divestiture and condemnations
of racism.

More than anything else, this
action demands a vocal and
unequivocal condemnation of the
request. This action calls for a
condemnation of the use of a “quiet

diplomacy” that seeks to keep the
students in the dark about the
request. Don't allow the United
Jewish Federation or the director of
the Hillel Foundation to usurp your
responsibility! Lend your voice to an
unequivocal condemnation of
racism and anti-Semitism.

Correcting Details

Few people realize the pressure
under which Pitt News reporters
operate. In addition to publication
deadlines, they have classes and
assignments. This probably explains
some erroneous details that need to
be corrected in the report on my
GSPIA noon colloquium on “Ethio-
pian Jews: Their Past and Future.”

The Sudanese government, while
subject to much criticism regarding
human rights violations toward its
own population, has maintained an
open door to refugees from famine-
stricken Ethiopia. Sudan is cooper-
ating with international relief
agencies to keep these people alive,
including those whose Jewish practi-
ces date back to the ritual practices
in vogue before the destruction of
the first temple in Jerusalem.

The estimated number left in Ethi-
opia is 10,000 to 15,000, somewhat
lower than the number quoted in the
Pitt News story.

While some of the Ethiopian Jews
come from isolated villages that are
days of walking from the nearest
road, my lecture made reference to
the fact that there also were several
Jewish schools in the country.
About 150 Ethiopian Jews are now
attending universities in Israel, some
of them with advanced standing
from having attended the University
of Addis Ababa.

What Exactly Is It?

I am writing in response to the
advertisement/article, “Wanted:
SGB Caricaturist,” that was pub-
lished on March 4 in The Pitt News.

I have one fundamental question
to ask about this “want ad" —- what
in the Sam Hill is it? ls it an article?

0

I’

An advertisement? An obituary?

I am reasonably sure that it isn't
an article; no author is credited with
writing it. Hence, it must be some
sort of advertisement. Did the SGB
actually place such an absurd adver-
tisement? Is it serious? Is the SGB so
desperate for attention that it is
forced to cheapen itself in a tasteless
attempt to be noticed?

Think about it, Pitt students. This
advertisement was obviously written
up by an SGB member. An SGB
member is supposedly a student
leader.‘ ‘ U ﬁfoifﬁﬁfffelyﬁ’ tl‘fiS "3‘d‘V‘e‘t‘=
tisement was written so poorly that
it is hard to believe that it was writ-
ten by a fifth—grader, let alone a col-
legiate leader.

For example, the section on Luke
Kluchko begins as follows: “Ladies

and gentlemen, I would now like to

introduce the l985 SGB President
Luke Kluchko. ” After that introduc-
tion, the author then quotes Mr.
Kluchko’s inaugural address. Is the
author trying to imitate Ed McMa-
hon on the Tonight Show (“Here’s
Johnny ...”), or is he trying to begin a
paragraph?

Furthermore, the stanza on Lisa
Douds is appalling. It speaks of
Lisa’s goal for this year, which is to
“regain SGB respect with the stu-
dents and administration.” Shame
on you! Maybe that is what you
want to do, but you sound so pes-
simistic and desperate — that is no
way to— gain respect. The article
makes it sound as if Ms. Douds is
blaming the students for the SGB’s
woes. Perhaps she really does want
to blame Pitt students, but I don’t
think so. I think it is a case of poor
discretion on the part ofthe author.

The section on Pete Petropoulos
was also poorly written. The ideas
expressed had potential, but the
author was entirely too stingy with
his verbs. Again, I don’t fault Mr.
Petropoulos; however, I do blame
this phantom author.

Finally, I would like to address
the author ofthis advertisement. His
idea wasn’t all that bad. I realize that
he probably wanted to give the SGB
some media coverage and drum up
student involvement in SGB. His
rationale for writing such an adver-
tisement is sound. But he really
should have written the advertise-
ment more carefully. Better yet, he
could have found a more capable
writer to express his thoughts.

Breaking Through/ Vicki Zeitner

The Absurdity of Midterm Exams

. Few instances in the student expe-
rience are more discouraging than
being rushed through a midterm
exam by a professor who insists on
interrupting either to tell you the
time or to explain an error in the
exam questions.

Imagine — if you need to —- that
you have 50 minutes to answer 75
exam questions, one of which is an
essay question. This means that, as
an average, you need to answer two
questions per minute in order to save
time for an honest approach to the
essay.

By the time the professor finishes
fondling the exam booklets, you’ve
lost five to 10 minutes. You com-
plete the first page of questions and
your teacher begins to keep time on
the blackboard, correcting it every
three minutes and subsequently tell-
ing you about it each time he does it.

He wants to make sure; you don’t
drift off into any sexual fantasies or
unnecessary analysis of the , exam
questions, so he says, “Don‘t waste

ime on the ones you’re not sure of,
just guess and move on ‘to the next
question.” Right. Just guess, what
the hell. .

You’re moving along at a comfor-
table pace and the professor inter-
rupts again, “If you’ll turn to the last
page you’ll noticethat there is a mis-
take on No. 5.” But you’re not on the
last page yet, you’re still on page
two. You try to regain your train of

 

%

thought, and the teacher pulls it
again: another mistake on the last
page. By now you’re sufficiently
annoyed to guess the answerto that
one and move on, since you’ve lost
another eight minutes.

Inconsistencies in the logic of the
grammar of the questions slow you
down considerably, as you have to
reread each statement three times
before being able to pass judgment.

If the questions were simply taken
verbatim from the book, which you
thought you had branded on short-
term memory, then you would prob-
ably have had no problem answering
two or three questions per minute.
What are these types of exams any-
way, if not just a collection of exer-
cises in short-term recall? But the
professor rewords the text's ideas
under the pretense that you are
being tested on your understanding
of the material. Meanwhile, he re-
erases and rewrites on the board “I 1
minutes remaining.”

You finally get to the essay ques-
tion with “4 minutes remaining.”
With both your mind and pencil
thoroughly dulled at this point, you
commence to engage in what is
known as “free thought writing.”
However, since the last 39 minutes
and 74 questions have mechanically
conditioned your thoughts to drop
from your forebrain in meaningless,
disassociated fragments, your
answer reads more like utterances
from an amnesia victim re-entering

up

the world than a coherent essay.
With two minutes remaining, how-
ever, you find yourself not even car-
ing whether or not your writing is
intelligible. Frankly, the more unin-
telligible, the better.

So much for examinations. When
I entered college, I was under the
impression that, unlike high schools,
universities trained you to think ~
you know, to analyze, synthesize
and evaluate. But you see, test ques-
tions that begin with “discuss" or
one of the words mentioned above
are too difficult for many professors
to grade. Such examinations, which
are real tests of comprehension and
retention, often allow students too
much freedom of thought to be
“gradeable." Professors then find
themselves having to re-evaluate the
material they teach each term as new
attitudes and perspectives of some
students cause them to approach
topics differently.

Such an educational method of
testing, though, is just not efficient.
Computers and TAs are not able to
correct these types of tests. After all,
in order for a test to be correctable,
there must be a right and wrong
answer to each question.

The Legend of St. Patrick

What do you call a small
building inhabited by wee Irish
people? Leprechaundos, of
course. Thisjoyous riddle was on -
one of the many festive greeting
cards I had to choose from in the
St. Patrick’s Day section of local
card store.

How about this one? What is
green and moist and clings to
rocks? Forgetting about the
upcoming holiday for a moment,
I first thought the answer was
“moss.” I was wrong. The answer
was "a stoned leprechaun.” I
should have known.

Just for the record, I am Irish,
but I just can't see why St.
Patrick’s Day has become the
commercial extravaganza that it
has. You know what I think? I
think most people don’t even
know what the holiday really is.

For the heck of it, I asked
around. Peoplejust looked at me
and shook their heads. One
thinker, though, was on the right
track. He said, “It has something
to do with snakes, right?” Well,
sort of.

You see, there was a legend
that a man named Patrick drove
all the snakes of Ireland into the
sea, or something like that. Actu-
ally, this man, who was once a
slave for pirates, went to Ireland
as a missionary and brought
Christianity to the people. He
also condemned the enslavement

of Christians.

Now this certainly gives me
ample reason to drink green beer
and wear those green party hats.
I might even be inclined to march
in a parade.

And did you know that “green
is keen" according to another
greeting card? When I was in
grade school, they would have
“Green Day” on St. Patrick’s
Day. Everyone was expected to
wear green. But I hated green,
and I therefore had no green
clothes. Boy, did I get ridiculed.

And did you know that St.
Patrick’s Day is now romantic?
Sure. “For you, darling, on St.
Patrick’s Day,” said one card.
“For my sweetheart ..." said
another. I fear that Valentine's
Day will soon become a thing of
the past. And who can resist
green Carnations?

Browsing through the store, I
found a card that was most
appropriate. “We’re not Irish,
but let's celebrate anyhow.
Happy St. Patrick’s Day.” With
this in mind, everyone flocks to
the nearby pubs (That’s what
bars are referred to in Ireland.)
dressed in green, throwing green
streamers, telling dumb Irish
jokes and drinking green beer.
Along this festive line, those
same folks will wake up the next
day with a festive complexion of
none other than — Green.

“strange sense of humor. It’s hard to
understand unless you know a lot of
engineers, but we don't really take
things as seriously as people seem to
think we do. We look at things two
ways — in a completely analytical
sense and in a completely non-

But if you have blown your first
credit opportunity by not paying on
time, it won’t haunt you for the rest
of your life. According to Gordon,
“Bad credit is forgotten after five
years, unless you owe somebody and
they decide to renew ajudgment on
you.

“Engineering classes are generally so
intense that people just don’t talk.
This is _an opportunity to get to
know each other and form some
bonds." '
Chemical engineer Mary Louise
Micklos agrees. “You get to talk to
people you would not normally talk
to, and it doesn’t matter who has a
2.0 and who has a 4.0  you are all
together for the

Judgements have to be renewed
every five years. But this doesn’t usu-

ally happen.”

Gordon advised, “It is important
for a student to take advantage of
any credit offered to him. And he
must use this credit to establish a

department.”

Engineers’ Week also works to
combat the stereotypical all-study,
no-fun notion of an engineer, she
said. “I think engineers are over-
stereotyped. We work hard, but we
play hard too,” said Micklos. “Peo-
ple think all we do is study, but as
long as you can budget your time,
you can have fun like any other nor-
mal person.”

Greek president

offers resignation

Greece (UPI) —— President
Constantine Karamanlis sent a
letter of resignation to the
speaker of the Greek parliament
yesterday, one day after the rul-
ing socialist party took steps to
block him from running for a
second term. Socialist Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou
announced Saturday that he
would not support Karamanlis
in his bid for a second term. ' C

The current five-year term of
the 78-year-old Karamanlis
expires on Friday. Until the par-
liament can decide on a new pres-
ident, its speaker will act as head
of state.

Karamanlis headed a pro-
American conservative govern-
ment that took power after seven
years of military rule ended in
1974.

Papandreou, the man who
triggered the Karamanlis resig-
nation, expressed his regret over
the decision. He said Karamanlis
had fulfilled his duties “in an
impeccable manner.”

Western diplomats and politi-
cal commentators describe the
manuevering as an apparent bid
by Papandreou to recapture sup-
port among left-wing elements of
the ruling party and two commu-
nist parties in October parlia-
mentary elections.

 

The awardees of the 1985 Nationality Room Scholarships for Summer Study Abroad were honored on
Saturday. The program is in its 37th year and Mrs. E. Maxine Bruhns is its director.

Swimmers win Easterns,

James Most Valuable

The Pitt men's swimming and div-
ing team ended its season on a posi-
tive note this weekend by winning
the Eastern Swimming and Diving
League Championships at Cleve-
land State over nine other teams.
One of those teams was West Virgi-
nia, whom the Panthers defeated for
the first time in four years by a score
of 780-690.

“It's been a long time since we’ve
beaten WVU,” said assistant coach
Jim Gamble. “We had more depth
and a greater determination to win.”

Richard James earned Most Val-
uable Swimmer honors by winning
the 100- and 200-yard backstroke.

Geoff Emore, who finished
second in the 100-yard butterﬂy,
second in the 200 backstroke and
third in the 100 backstroke, said the
team members had a better attitude
going into the meet than they’ve had
in the past. V“We were definitely
thinking it was possible, whereas in
the past three years, we went in
thinking we were the underdog.
They beat us earlier in the year, and

we were thinking of revenge."

“The timing was also good — with
the Big East being last week, every-
thing just sort of came together,"
Emore added.

Charles Lersch won the 1,650-
yard freestyle (His time was 16:39.)
and finished second in the 500-yard
freestyle and second in the 200-yard
freestyle.

Don Martin finished third in the
200-yard breast stroke and second in
the 200-yard individual medley.

Pitt placed third in the 400-yard
freestyle relay, second in the 400-
yard medley relay and second in the
800-yard freestyle relay.

In the diving events, Todd Mulzet
won the one-meter dive and Jack
Shuten placed second in the three-
meter event.

Swimmers who will compete in
the Senior Nationals, which take
place in East Los Angeles the first
week in April, include Don Martin,
Chuck Lersch, Geoff Emore and

Rich James. _ _

‘Pitt ends home season

with win over Slippery Rock

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s gymnastics team
competed in its final home meet on
Saturday afternoon at Trees Hall
and defeated the Rockets of
Slippery Rock 267.6-230.75. The
Panthers were never really
challenged as they won every event,
individually and as a team.

Junior All-East competitor Mark

,-Klafter kept the pace high for Pitt

and set a personal best with a score
of 56.6 in the all-around
competition. This score is a mere .05
points shy of the school record held
by All-East teammate Matt Peters,
who set the mark earlier this year.
Klafter won three individual
events, including ﬂoor exercise
(9.85), pommel horse (9.1) and high
bars (9.75). He also finished second
on rings by adding a new move and
scored a 9.2. However, the real
drama unfolded in the opening floor
exercise when freshman standout
Jorge Sanchez obtained a 9.75 on his
routine. Klafter, who hasn’t lost on
floor this season, then proceeded to

capture his 9.85 score.

“My early season injuries are no
longer serving as a hindrance,”
Klafter explained. “The combina-
tion of the pressure of .Iorge‘s score
and my ankle improvement really
helped me to pull it out  I didn’t
hold back on anything.” ‘_

Jimior Matt Peters finished first
on rings (9.4) and parallel bars (9.45)
but did have some difficulty on the
pommel horse — his least favorite
event. “During practice, my horse
routine usually goes well. During the
meet, I just wasn’t thinking hard
enough,” Peters said. “The scoring
system in gymnastics is pretty
ambiguous  I just try to go out
there and do my best.”

Nevertheless, Peters finished
second in the all-around with a score
of 55.0, followed by Sanchez with
52.9. I

Sophomore Mike Mealie took
second in his best event by scoring
an 8.95 on the pommel horse but
said he is “looking for my best scores
of the year” on Saturday at Penn
State.

Other Panthers contributing to
the victory included junior Marty
Comini with a 9.1 on ﬂoor and an
8.85 in vaulting. Comini’s vault

routine had been inconsistent, but it
appears that it may now be coming
around. “We had a good straight
week of practice,” he said. “Our
enthusiasm was definitely at a high.
We were shooting for a 270 but fell
just a little bit short.”

Sophomore Ben Rovee used a
new routine on rings in taking a
third behind Klafter and Peters with
an 8.7. The routine included a
difficult mount that resulted in a

weary performance.

“I didn’t expect to score high,"
Rovee said afterwards. “This was
the first time I had ever used this
routine in competition. As a matter
of fact, F riday’s practice was the first
time I ever even attempted it.”

This was the last home meet for
senior captain Ed Miller. Miller,
Pitt's only senior, was injured two
weeks ago when the Panthers were

forearm to McDonald‘s neck area,
sending both players to the floor.
Hoya senior Ralph Dalton rushed to
McDonald’s aid as both benches
cleared. Mullin, always thinking,
turned and walked away, rather
than risk ejection from the game.
Order was restored, and play con-
tinued with McDonald being
assessed a personal foul.

The final bout came with 7:16
remaining in the final game. With
Georgetown ahead by 12, Redman
guard Mark Jackson hit a jumper
from the foul line. Once again, in the
fight for position, two players got
involved in a scuffle. This time it was
Beaver Falls native Ron Rowan of
St. John’s and Georgetown’s Reggie
Williams. Rowan wound up on the
receiving end ofthe worst call of the
tournament.

Williams hit Rowan with an
elbow, and Rowan proceeded to
square off but did not retaliate, more
protecting himself. Williams then
swung at Rowan, poking Rowan in
the eye, but still no retaliatory
strikes from Rowan. As benches
cleared, the referees managed to
keep everything in order, but ejected
Williams and Rowan.

Ewing, who remained cool for
most of the game, in part because he
spent most of the game on bench in
foul trouble, declined the offer to
discuss the fights. But Thompson
offered an explanation of what had
happened. “When the adrenaline is
ﬂowing in high-level competition
like this, pride is at stake,” said
Thompson. “Everybody gets very
excited.”

All in all, the only surprises in the
whole tournament were who was
squaring off against whom. If
Thompson is right about the level of
intensity in the conference tourna-
ment causing the scufﬂes, what
about in a few weeks when his team
is playing for the national cham-
pionship. Will they bring knives and
baseball bats?

admitted. “Anybody can have an off
night. You can’t come out every sin-
gle night and expect double figures.”

His coach, Lou Carnesecca, was
incredulous at the outcome of the
game. “We get 80 points," Carne-
secca said. “That’s an unbelievable
situation. You’d think 80 points is
enough to win. Now, if we scored 40,
I'd be frustrated.”

Chris Mullin, St. John‘s forward/’
guard, led everyone with 25 points
but got only SIX in the second half.

“They made it so tough to get the
ball, and then when you do get it, it’s
so tough to post up,” Mullin said.
“They always play so hard. The
thing is it’s the type of team that if it
isn’t shooting well, it rebounds well,
and if it doesn't rebound well, then
it’s shooting [well]. Tonight, they
definitely outplayed us.” —

For most ofthe night, Thompson
employed the box-and-one defense
with David Wingate (17 points) on
Mullin while the rest of the Hoyas

went zone.

It was a repeat of Feb. 27: Mullin
played his usual game (21 points)
while the Redmen didn’t in the 85-69
loss.

Strikingly different from George-
town’s last Garden visit was the
physicality of the game. Referee
Dick Paparo handed out five techni-
cals, including two to Thompson,
and ejected both Williams and Red-
ma_n reserve Ron Rowan.

Tl1’e“ej’er:tions came 13 minutes
into the second half after Williams,

_not taking to Rowan’s attempted

boxout, landed his left elbow across
Rowan’s right eye.

“I was a little upset,” Williams
said. “I always want to be in during
the big games."

Four minutes into the game,
Paparo assessed the Carnesecca
bench a technical. After four more
minutes, Thompson became
enraged. Seemingly, Mullin hadjust
decked Perry McDonald, hardly
battle-ready as a freshman, after the

two ﬂailed for a rebound.

McDonald got the intentional
and Mullin made five of six free
throws as Paparo called Thompson
for yet another technical.

“I was worried about the game,
but I was also worried about the
extra-curricular activities," Mullin
said.

“We’re out there for one reason —
to play basketball. It'sjust that we’re
playing so hard. That's how things
are stirred up.”

Later both Carnesecca and Bill
Wennington (7-0 center with 16
points and a only four rebounds)
garnered technicals as Paparo
would stand for none of Friday
night’s doings. Syracuse met the
Hoyas in a semi-ﬁnal game featuring
the Ewing-Dwayne Washington
bout. The Pearl got the decision as
his sucker punch grounded Ewing
for several minutes.

ranked teams met four, let alone,
three times in one season. A fourth
would be March 30 or April 1 in the
NCAA Final Four at Lexington.

For now, both powers are seeded
first in the NCAA Tournament
regionals beginning Thursday. The
Redmen (27-3), in the west, will face
Southern University in Salt Lake
City while Georgetown (30-2),
seeded in the east for the first time in
three years, will play Lehigh in
Hartford.

Can anyone stop the Hoyas? The
man with the best chance, Carne-
secca, is subtle in his answer: “They
didn’t quit — we went after them as
best we could on all counts. Now
you put me in a situation where I
think of the great Kentucky, Indiana
and UCLA teams ...”

Lou Carnesecca likes very much
Georgetown’s chances of repeating
as national champions.

Brawls mar tournament

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The hottest ticket in the nation
over the weekend was a ticket to the
Big East conference championships
at Madison Square Garden in New
York City. Tickets had not been so
highly sought after since Joe Frazier
and Muhammed Ali fought in the
early ’70s. Ironically so, the Big East
tournament resembled the under-
card for the Ali—Frazier bout.

Due to some inconsistent officiat-
ing, combined with what was at
stake, there were a few extracurricu-
lar activities over the weekend at the
garden. First, Friday night, early in
the first half of the Syracuse/ Geor-
getown semi-ﬁnal game, Dwayne

“Pearl” Washington and Patrick
Ewing squared off in what would
only be a warmup to the main event.

With 13:59 remaining in the ﬁrst
half, Hoya guard David Wingate
popped a jumper from the left wing.
During the scramble for rebound
position, Washington and Ewing
became entangled and Washington
delivered an elbow into Ewing’s
groin. “The Pearl”then quickly spun
and squared off to the 7-1 Ewing.

was charged with a personal foul,’
and Ewing with an intentional tech-

calm crowd into a frenzy.

Georgetown, characteristically,
downplayed the incident. “That
might have been the most exciting
thing that happened in the game,”
said Georgetown head coach John
Thompson. “I don’t know," con-
tinued Thompson. “Anytime you
get an emotionally packed game,
emotions are gonna flair.”

Flair they did, one night later dur-
ing the championship game between
St. John's and Syracuse, benches
cleared, not once but twice. Midway
through the first half, St. John’s
guard Chris Mullin was attempting
to come inbounds when Hoya guard
Perry McDonald stepped in his
path. Mullin promptly delivered a

All-America McRae meets best in the

Press Box

Led by Most Valuable Swimmer Richard
James, the Pitt men’s swimming and diving
team won the Eastern Regionals.

in the race was Pitt freshman Lee
McRae, who achieved All-America
status Saturday in the event.
McRae made his way to the finals
in what was at that point his tough-
est race of the year. In his trial heat,
which he won, McRae faced the
two-time defending NCAA cham-
pion in the 60-meters, Rod Richard-
son of Texas A&M, and the
Olympic bronze medalist in the 200-
meters, Thomas Jefferson of Kent

State. McRae’s time of 6.17 in the
trials, which enabled him to advance
to the finals, would have placed him
second in the finals. He finished
sixth in the finals with 6.26.

“I know I could do better. Consid-
ering I was a freshman and all, and
the first six places get All-America, I
was pleased,” said McRae of his
sixth-place finish.

Pitt head coach John Vasvary was

For the first time since I982,
the Panthers are headed for the
NCAA Tournament. Yesterday,
announcing its largest field (64)
ever, the NCAA has Pitt facing
Louisiana Tech in one of four
games to be held at Tulsa in the
Midwest Regionals.

The game will be played in
Mabee Center on the Oral
Roberts University campus
Thursday at 7 p.m. (CST).

Having just dropped a 69-61
decision to Villanova in the first
round of the Big East tourna-
ment last Thursday, the Panthers
will defend a I7-ll record.

Pitt is in!

They are seeded 12th in the
region, Louisiana Tech fifth.

The Ruston, La. school
recently won the Southland Con-
ference championship enroute to
a 27-2 record. The Bulldogs have
been revamped extensively
under sixth-year coach Andy
Russo, formerly a Panola (Tex.)
Junior College coach.

Russo, 36, has been charged
with upgrading the men’s pro-
gram to that of the nationally-
ranked Lady Techsters.

Four of the last five seasons
have seen him go 17-10, 20-10,

Georgetown rolls

to Big

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

NEW YORK --- Even though
there should have been no doubt
that the winner would be George-
town, St. John's-Georgetown III
was acted out the wrong way. The
two titans sparred Saturday night in
a rubber game for the Big East
championship in Madison Square
Garden.

It was Georgetown in a runaway
92-80 as the Hoyas proved their 85-
69 win l0 days earlier on the same
court was no fluke. More so, the
duel finally settled this incongruity
of the nation’s No. l team, George-
town, being ranked second behind
St. John’s in the league tournament.

To be remembered is how Coach
John Thompson cemented a second
straight Big East championship.
Foul trouble forced him to bench his
All-America center, Patrick Ewing,
for 21 minutes. First, Ewing exited
eight-and-a—half minutes into the
game. He only played seven first-
half minutes, scoring ll mediocre
points and grabbing seven rebounds
in the game.

In his place, though, 6-ll Ralph
Dalton and Reggie Williams offered
brilliant defense as each picked up

also pleased with McRae’s finish:
“He’s a freshman. He made it to the
national championships and made
All-America. He was competing
against some of the best runners in
the world."

McRae showed how powerful a
runner he IS by running his second-
fastest time of the year; his time
equaled the Carrier Dome record he
set three weeks ago at the Big East
championships. Pressure has come

East win

seven more rebounds and scored a
combined 23 points. Ordinarily,
Dalton is Ewing’s shadow, giving
the 7-0 center breathing space. And
Williams, a forward, weighs only
I80 lbs.

So? He had more offensive boards
(four) than any Redman.

“The main part was we ran the fast
breaks. That was our key," Williams
said, referring to a preponderance of
second and third shots bestowed
upon the Hoyas.

“That says a lot about Dalton,”
guard Michael Jackson added.
“When Patrick goes out, that tells
other players they have to go to the
boards stronger. A lot ofpeople tend
to write us off when Patrick leaves."

“We didn’t worry,” said Bill Mar-
tin, who scored 18 points, mostly on
multiple efforts. “Ralph was playing
well the last couple of games, so we
felt good around him.”

Georgetown outrebounded St.
John’s 36-l9. The Redmen had been
averaging 33.7.

Equally befitting St. John’s down-
fall was that it didn’t register its first
rebound until Mark Jackson (a
guard) snagged one with 12:07
expired. Walter Berry, the Redmen’s
leader in rebounding (8.9), might as
well have been AWOL.

“I don’t think it was frustrating,”
Berry (14 points, seven rebounds)

business

and gone for the confident fresh-
man. After winning the Eastman
Kodak. Invitational and conference
championships, he was going to
meet his greatest test at the NCAAS.

“I handled the pressure a lot bet-
ter,” said McRae of his performance
this weekend. After beating some of
the best people in the world in the
previously mentioned races, he was
ready for the NCAAs.
