THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Informal Rush
By Fraternities

To Start Today

By ED BACHMAN

A week of informal rushing
ushers in the three-week fra-
ternity rushing period, start-
ingitoday at the University of
Pittsburgh. At the close of
this week, the 18 social fra-
ternities at Pitt will have the

1, through 2 a.m. Sunday, Oc-
tuber 14, each fraternity will
be permitted to stage five rush-
ing events, of which two may

Law and Order Rule As

Cops Patrol

By JIM MARINO

A call to extension 310 will
bring an answer of “Police De-
partment,” as a result of a new
effort by Pitt to enforce traffic
and University regulations.

A ten—man police detail has
been formed under the leader-
ship of Lt. Charles Ray in the De-
partment of Buildings and
Grounds. The new policemen are
fully commissioned by the City
of Pittsburgh Police Department
to make arrests and issue traffic
tickets. According to Lt. Ray, the
force also will enforce rules of the
University concerning such things
as fire regulations and protection
of property.

Two uniformed policemen are
on duty at the University around
the clock. They are Sgt. George
Morgan and officer Morris Marks.
Sgt. Morgan works from 8 a.m.
to 4 p.m. and patrols the campus
for traffic violators. Officer
Marks works the night watch cen-
tering his attention around the
Cathedral and surrounding
grounds.

Lt. Bay has attended a Police
school for three years and was a
member of the Wilkinsburg Aux-
iliary Police before taking the
position as head of the University
Police Department in March of
this year.

Joseph Hedges, Albert Harri-
son. George McFeatcrs, Thomas
Willis, Arthur Czarnecki, Peter
Hopchock, and Joseph Coll are
also members of the Police force
in addition to their other duties
at the University.

Hedges has been employed by
the University as School Marshal
for several years with Harry
Berry. He has now been given the
powers of a police officer and can
make arrests on suspicion. Mc-

Featers is employed as building.

Special Classes
For Air Force
Continue Here

A special program at Pitt will
enable Air Force ofﬁcers to have
an opportunity to become skilled
executives and administrators for
their branch of the service.

Officers who take the course
in management and business ad-
ministration are groomed for top
Air Force posts which demand
business and executive skills.

The Pitt program began in 1948
when the Air Force sent an ofﬁcer
to take an eight-week summer
course oiTered.to the University
for business executives. By 1949,
at the request of the Air Force, the
School of Business Administra-
tion had worked out ‘a special

-program for Air Force officers.

In planning the curriculum,
the School of Business Admini-
stration conferred with all types
of businesses in the‘Pittsburgh
area to see what should be in-«
cluded in a well-rounded pro-
gram. Subjects offered include
industrial organization, business
management, accounting, busi-
ness law, personnel administra-
tion, statistics, economics, hu-
man relations and managerial
report writing. Altogether the
officers complete 48 credit hours.

While taking the Pitt course,
the officers are considered business
executives rather than military
men. Uniforms are discarded in
favor of “civies” for classroom
wear, and management fundamen-

-tals completely replace military

techniques.

"THERE HE GOES- GRANPSTANDING A6AlN.'

The reorganization of Pitt’s administrative structure by
Chancellor Litchﬁeld and the Board of Trustees clearly
shows a strong emphasis on a thorough education. From
the office of Chancellor to the Deans of the various divi-
sions, the new structure seems to be aiming for a strong
undergraduate program that will provide a solid basis for
future schooling.

V The change has been felt most in the College. This
comes as no surprise since it is believed that both graduate
work and the professional schools are dependent upon the
three, divisions of the undergraduate school. These divi-
sions—now referred to as the social sciences, the natural
sciences, and the humanities——-will each have its own dean.
The position of Dean of the College will be kept, how-
‘ever, for undergraduate curriculum planning, counseling
and degree—granting purposes.‘

The objective of reorganizing the College has been to
develop both the sciences and humanities so that each may
make a maximum contribution to the entire University.
There is, however, no intention of reducing the interests
in undergraduate work. Instead, the aim is to achieve a
‘balance among the purposes of the newly-created divisions.

’ The entire area of the disciplines will be headed by a
vice chancellor, not an office for administrative routine
but rather for educational leadership, as the vice chan-
cellors of the health and professional schools are also re-
garded. The vice chancellors therefore will be in the

unique position of coordinating administration with the
.academic pursuits of ‘the University. ' ’

Perhaps the entire scheme of things is summed up
‘best in the responsibilities of the disciplines: the first to
undergraduate instruction, the second to graduate work
and the third to provide active and continuing support for

. the professional schools. With such carefully thought—out
Q .

organization, it is hard-to see how the objectives could
* not be accomplished.

For Well - rounded People ’. . .

Serious Education

By Irv Rofhmon

Each student at the University, in order to
mature properly, must join extra—curricular activi-
ties to supplement his book larnin’. A joiner will
be a deer and all activity areas must be expanded
to meet‘ the ever-increasing numbers, of students
who wish to be well-rounded.

The successfullgraduating senior must be the
circumﬂuent personality devel- .
oped under the auspices of many i
clubsponsors. Such a person
may be recognized as well-
rounded because he usually
travels in circles.

He may also be identiﬁed by
the manner in which /he ﬂaunts
his organization keys rather than
his academic diploma. He also 
prides himself in having passed‘  ' ,,
courses without opening ‘one volume of collateral
reading. He is also an expert at cramming for
tests; in his career as a student he ﬁnds little time
to study between tests.

Friendship Society _ J

This joiner has many friends all of whom be-
long to the same mutual friendship society; but
we have an idea the organization will lose its
charter shortly. This expanding University no
longer has room for it. -

Despite. increased student unionfacilities and
dormitories all of which will enhance extra-cur-
ricular activities at the University, such suppl'e-
mentary programming will be sharply contained;
the student who likes to join copious activities and
would much rather prefer to spend his extra time
meandering in extra—curricular balderdash will ﬁnd
himself required to devote his time to his basic
subjects in school. ‘ .

How will this come about? Certainly no im-
inature points systems will be used to regulate stu-
dents’ activities; certainly no investigating com-
mittees will be established to adjudicate the abili-
ty of students to participate. Under the changing

  

rules and regulationssin their choices oi‘ activi-
ties. Such itemsdeny the student his self-deter-
mination.

Developing Conclusions

However, the educational theorist is actively at
work behind the scenes. From the planning stages,
these conclusions are developing:

When College Boards determine Pitt entrance
requirements, as they will in the near future, we
will bring into the University students who have
shown a basictinterest in academics. Thus much
of the battle will be won; and the change has
started this year.

These are and will be thinking students who may.
realize sooner than too late that a surplus of ac-
tivities is far less important than a basic under-
standing of the». subject material. Professors har-
ried by students who ﬁnd little time to do col-"
latoral work may now proceed conﬁdent that their
students are interested in what they and other
scholars have to say.

Subtle Philosophy

But even more subtle than registration require-
ments is the philosophy developihg in the student
union. We understand that much of the space will
be given to facilities which will enhance serious
contemplation of academics without formal instruc-
tion: comfortable reading rooms, music appreciation
facilities, lounging quarters for discussions.

Certainly there will be rooms for Student Gov- V

ernment, Publications, Religious Organizations,
clubs, and dining facilities. But all areas will be
blended so comfortably into one great compre-
hension center that extra hours whiled away in

academics will prove just as enjoyable as extra ‘

hours spend in extra-curricular programming.
Our curriculum may even prove more interest-
ing. 
So it may be‘ that students will soon learn to
join those activities which they can be assured will‘
beneﬁt them in their profession or vocation as well
as those which will enhance their social life. But "

Progressive Jazz

By Phil Moskol

An introduction to modern jazz
is not easy to relate to people who

have never entered the realms of
self expression by way of music.

The classiﬁcation of a modern
musician is based on his ability to
play as he feels. Musicians inter-
pret this ability as “feeling your
soul.”

Among the many groups of jazz
musicians, there are only a few
who have attained the prestige
which is associated with the cut-
ting of their first record.

The opening scene is inside a
small pub, illuminated by a ser-
ies of violet lights which cast an
eerie glow on patrons and music-
ians.

Definite Harmony

After a short time in the pub,
you come to notice a quartet play-
ing a rendition of “My Funny
Valentine.” There is a deﬁnite
harmony within this group that
brings you to the realization that
an undeterminable amount of
hours has been consumed in re-
hearsing. The closeness of har-
mony, the off-beat breaks, and the
driving rhythm inhibits every
movement and ‘thought.

give the musicians a feeling of
self-satisfaction because they are
entertaining their audience.

A lone voice calls from the mass
of people, “April in Paris,” then
another, “Caravan.” The leader of
the combo casually nods to the
drummer, Jerry Bettors.
Drummer Sets Face

The drummer sets a pace, the
trombonist picks up his horn and

.waits for the bass and piano play-

er to join the drummer to bring
each individual sound into one
harmonious rhythm. The trom-
bonist whispers, “Bridge,” and
joins the orchestration with the
smooth and mellow sounds of his
horn.

The ﬂashing style of Jerry Bet-
‘tors on drums is comparable to
Gene Krupa, Harold Bettors,
breeds in familiarity with Tommy
Turk, while the bass man, Chuck
Ramsey has a style all his own.
The piano man, Bernie Prinshaw
depicts himself as Erroll Garner,
whose left hand always plays a
a second slower than his right.

These musicians combine their
talents to give the public a mod-
ern jazz quartet with its style in-
dependent from any other group
appearing in Pittsburgh. if

In-I-erview Held

A’ later interview with Jerry

history and ambition of this
quartet.

The quartet is still comprised
of the original musicians, except

for an alternate bass player, Ed- .

The group had its start in Con-
nellsville, Pennsylvania, and grad-
ually moved into Pittsburgh. The
men have been playing together
for eight years. ~ ~

The ambition of these men has
not only brought them satisfac-
tion but has increased their pop-

Every musical group hastthe
ambition to cut” a -top—notch_. rec-
ord but this is close to impossible
if you do not have a recording

is holding the group down. The

they would like to record.

A At Oslo University

By BARBARA CHERINGTON

“Brrrrrrrrrrrr! It was cold,”
said Fran Hedges, 1956 Nor-
,wegian Committee Awardee
when she was asked about her

- trip this summer. “It rained

everywhere I went except for

» two weeks in Norway."

But even ‘with bad weather,
Norway impressed Fran as a
simple, clean town
with sparkling white apartment

,,,,,,,,,buildings, flower boxes in win-
. ldows and many bicycles.” -

On the boat trip to Norway, on
the Bergansfjord. Fran had an
amusing experience with a Danish
waiter ‘who was “too anxious to
please.” Having received an order

’ of fried egg turned over, puffed
- 0‘ rice and prunes, he brought back

a dish with those items piled one

 ontop of the other.

Campers Relax
In Norway, “people relax, and
the many pine—covered ‘hills and
lakes- attract folks out-of-doors.
Most Norwegian families pack up

, tngvvacations. Maybe this is why

they are such healthy—1ookin5g
people,” Fran said. .

“The Norwegians think Amer-
icans are all rich people who
smoke and drink constantly and
get everything done by pushing
buttons,” Fran said. V

While in the various Scan-
dinavian countries, Fran saw
the country side of L_illeham-
met with rolling hills like

Pennsylvania, the “lovely Rui-

kan Valley,” and , Stockholm.

This last city was to the

awardee, one of “the léveliest

cities” she had seen.

Physical education, and history

A.,.....§[_Were the courses Fran took at

‘ Oslo University in Norway. Orien-
teering was a popular form of re-

‘ ’creation for the students. In this
a sport, students were given a map

and a compass and sent out into

A forests, lakes, bogs, and hills to

find various assigned points.

Fran said she found herself
often in the "not too pleasant
situation of having muck up to
the knees.”

Literary Rates High

A high rate of literacy exists
in Norway. All schooling is free,
even in the university. An exam
is given after high school from

LAND OF THE SETTING SUN is where Fran Hedges lived
Fran, who studied physical educa-

 

tion and history at the University of Oslo, found the Norwegians
a hearty, healthy people. In addition to the usual sports, she was
introduced to a new form of recreation, which the Norwegians call

Orienteering.

The 1956 Norwegian Committee Awardee, impressed by na-
ture at its best, compared the rolling hills of the Scandinavian
countries to those of Pennsylvania. Here, in the Norwegian Na-
tionality Room,'Fran holds white birch logs like those found in
many homes in her travels through Norway.

dents. Others are accepted to ad-
vanced work only if their place-
ment is high. “Competition is now
very keen for admittance to the
university,” Fran said.
..More than 50 per cent of the
6000 schools have less than 35
pupils. Of these, 900 have less
than 13 enrolled.
“Students are enrolled but do
not have to attend classes or
take tests until their ﬁnal ex-
am for graduation which they
‘take when they feel they have
learned all they can,” Fran ex-
plained.

“I learned much about Norway
during my ﬁve weeks of classes
at the University. We had, a very
wide representation of important
people in government, medicine,
church and business speaklto us
on their particular ﬁelds. One day
we had a question period with the
Bishop and the Head of the Public
Health concerning the ‘Welfare
State.’ We also had the opportu-
nity to hear a panel discussion by
various party members in parlia-
ment.”

After completing her course at
Oslo, Fran rode to Bergen by
train. There on the west coast of

Attend Camp;

School Wins Trophy

By DONNA CONSIDINE ‘

Twenty-ﬁfth annual Freshman Camp, help Sept. 14 to
16 at Kon-O-Kwee near Zelienople, was attended by 207
freshmen and 45 upperclass counselors.

The program, consisting of informal orientation, in-
cluded sports, discussions, campﬁres, songs and skits to
acquaint freshmen with college life.

Freshmen were divided into ﬁve sections: College, Busi-

ness Administration, Pre—Medicine,

+1-Engineering Blue, and Engineer-
"‘ing Gold. The team trophy was

won by Business Administration in
athletic competition.

Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant
chancellor of student affairs, spoke
Friday night on the topic “Grow
with Pitt.” He said, “There is a

' great difference between getting a

degree and getting an education.
Real education is a deep, pro-
found and genuine growth . . .
you are not just going to school
but shaping the kind of man you
want to be.”

Faculty advisors also spoke to
their sections, and representa-
tives from Army and Air Force
ROTC talked with the new stu-
dents. .

The value of activities was the
subject of a panel discussion held

 Saturday morning with students,

umni and faculty members par-
ticipating. .
After ‘worship service Sunday

2

morning freshmen had talks with
the deans of their sections.

The weekend program ended
with the 25th anniversary dinner,
at which Vincent Lanfear, dean
of the School of Business Admini-
stration, was guest speaker.

The following is a quotation
of John Holbrook, first student
chairman of Freshman Camp,
held in‘ 1931, and attended by
46 campers, 16 counselors and
]faculty members.

“If you’re accepted at Pitt, one
of the best ways to get a good
start is to cap Freshman Week
with a weekend at Freshman
Camp. You’ll never regret it be-
cause that kind of start helps take
care of a good ending four years
later.”

Meade Beers, Ed. ’57, was chair-
man of Freshman Camp. Robert
Musulin, Col. ’56, was program
chairman, and- David Caird, Col.
’5, was secretary.

through “beautiful snow—covered
mountains.” P
Then Fran sailed to England.
For ﬁve days in that ‘country’s
capital, Fran said, she “must have
covered. every inch by foot.” Big
Ben, Regent Park Zoo, Westmin-
ster Abbey, and Parliament were
among her sight-seeing highlights.
Saw Grandmother’s Church
In Birmingham, Fran saw the
church and organ her grandmoth-
er once used. She visited Shakes-
peare’s home and Warwick Castle,

referred to in “Beowulf.” In the »

Lake District, Wordworth’s home,
she rowed in Wondermere, the
largest lake there.

Edinburgh"s music festival
came near the. end of the trip.
Sir Thomas Beecham directed
the Royal Philharmonic Orches-
tra. Sadler Wells ballet was
presented. Bagpipers and high-
land dancing was part of a “mil-
itary Tatoo.” “Pleasures of Scot-
land” was a musical pageant of
dances and songs.‘ _

All through her. trip, Fran ad-
mitted, she missed a “good old
American hamburger.” And even
though she “enjoyed learning and
living in Norway,” Fran really ap-.

about one third of the cost on
articles taxed.”

In Holland, she visited a few
villages where people wore native
costumes, wooden shoes and
colored aprons and hats.

‘ Paris “didn’t impress me too
much after seeing the beautiful
Scandinavian _ countries,” F r a n
said. She visited the Eiffel Tower,
Le Louvre, and Arch de Triomph.

The plane trip back to the
United States took 13 hours. Her
boat trip to Europe took ten days.

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

Today I begin the third year of writing this col-‘
umn for Philip Morris Cigarettes, and I _am'merry in-

my heart.

I am merry for several reasons. First, because I am
being paid. _

Not, let me hasten to state, that an emolument was
necessary. “Sits,” I said a few days ago to the makers
of Pliilip Morris, who underneath their dickeys are as
friendly as pups and twice as cute, “Sirs,” I said to this
Winsome assemblage, “there is no need to pay me for_
writing this column. If I can introduce America’s college
men and women to Philip Morris’s natural tobacco good-
ness, if I can inaugurate them into the vast sodality of
Philip Morris smokers and thus enhance their happiness,
heighten their zest, upgrade their gusto, magnify their
cheer, broaden their bliss, augment their glee, and in-
crease their PQ—”

“PQ?” said the makers, looking at me askance.

“Pleasure Quotient,” I explained.
“Ah!” said the makers, nodding their sweet, shaggy

I heads.

“If,” I continued, “I can do these splendid things for
the college population of America, there is no need for
money, because I am more than amply repaid.”

We wept then. I am not ashamed to say it. WE
WEPT! I wish the wiseacres who say big business is
cold and heartless could have been therethat day. I/wish
they could have witnessed the deep, croaking sobs that
racked the gathering, the great, shimmering tears that
splashed on the boardroom table. We wept, every man-
jack of us. The makers wept. The secretaries wept. I
wept. My agent, Clyde Greedy, wept. We wept all. ’ .

“No, no!” cried one of the makers, whose name is

A Good Sam. “We insist on paying you.”

“Oh, all right,” I said.

Then we laughed. The gloom passed like at summer
shower. We all laughed and chose up sidesand played
stoop-tag and had steaming mugs of cocoa and lit plump,
ﬁrm, white cigarettes, brimming full of natural tobacco
goodness. I mean Philip Morris, of corris!

L Refreshed and exalted, wereturned to the busi-

name IS Merry Andrew, “what will you write about in
your column this year?” 7

“About students and teachers,” I said. “About classes
and cutting. About eds and coeds. About Greeks and
independents. About the important issues that occupy
the-supple young minds of college America.”

. “Like what?” asked, one of the makers, whose name
IS Tol’able David. L _

“Like how to ﬁnance a full social life without a re-
volver,” I replied. “Like how to wear Bermuda shorts
though your knees look like brain-coral. Like how to
double—date in an MG.”

“And will you,” asked one of the makers, whose name
is Peter-Sit-by-the—Fire, “from time to time say a pleas-
ant word about Philip Morris Cigarettes, which are now
available in two sizes-Regular in the familiar Snap-
Open Pack, and Long Size in the new Crushproof Box?”

‘jCrazy kid!” I chuckled, pushing my list gently
against hlS Jaw. “You know I will.”

And we all shook hands — silently, ﬁrmly, manlﬂy _
and I left, dabbing at my eyes with my agent, and hurried
to the nearest typewriter. ‘

Score Twgljuick TD’s
After Mountie Fumbles

By ED KOLTISKA _

Coach John Michelosen’s ﬁery halftime talk helped the
Panther gridders come alive and score to quick touchdowns
in the early minutes of the third quarter to give the Blue
and Gold a 14-13 victory over a ﬁghting West Virginia eleven

at Morgantown Saturday.

A record crowd of 34,800 fans witnessed the underdog
Mounties explode for the ﬁrst points of the game in the
second period on a 15-yard pass from quarterback Mickey
Trimarki to right end Joe Kopnisky which set up the touch-

down.

On the next play Trimarki pushed over the score, but

Jim Pickett‘s bid for the extra?

point was wide. It later turned
out to be the margin of victory
for the Jungle Cats as the score
stood 6-0 in favor of the Ridge-
runners at the intermission.

of the game and dominate the
play as he did in the ﬁrst half.
With successive handoffs to Ralph
Anastasio and fullback Larry
Krutko, the Ridgerunners moved
the ball to midfield before Tom
Jenkins intercepted a Trimarki
aerial intended for Kopnisky on

the Panther 41.

The Panthers, having trouble
moving the ball, could only ad-
vance the ball to the 47 on hand
offs from Darrell Lewis to Ray
DiPasquale and Jenkins. With

. fourth and four, Jenkins got a

50-yard punt off that landed on

the West Virginia three-yard

line.

On the ﬁrst play, Krutko took
the ball on a handoff from Tri-
marki and tried the left side of
the line. There he was jarred
loose from the ball by Dan Wis-
niewski and I-lerm Canil with
Vince Socrsone dropping on the
loose pigskin on the two—yard
line.

DiPasquale Ties Score

Lewis handed off to Jenkins
who was stopped by the middle of
the line on the first play. On the
next play DiPasqua1e ran around

his left end into pay dirt to tie

the score at 6-6.
Bugs Bagamery converted to

i put the Panthers ahead 7-6. 

Bagamery’s kick-off was taken
by Anastasio in the end zone and
run out to the 20 before Bob
Pollock and Dick Scherer knock-
ed him loose from the ball with
Bagamery recovering the fumble.

Lewis Kicks Deciding Point

Lewis, again guiding the Blue
and Gold, threw a six-yard pass
to Corky Cost on the 14. After
successive handoffs to Cost and
Nick Passodelis without a gain,
Lewis on a bootleg carried the
ball to the nine. Passodelis then
took a handolf for four yards over
left tackle and on the next play
went wide around left end for
the score. Lewis then split the up-
rights to put the Panthers ahead,
14-6..

The Mountaineers took Lewis’
kickoff in the end zone and

 

brought it back to their 40. With
hard running by Whipkey and
Anastasico, the Ridgerunners
moved the ball to the Panther
37. ' :-

A Trimarki to Bruce McClung
pass was good for 11 yards and a
roughing penalty against the Blue
and Gold put the ball on the 12.
Again, before the ball was moved,
the Panthers were penalized for

encroachment which moved the 1

ball down to the one after Krutko

line for six yeards.

Harriers Seem Strong
Despite Loss of Stars

If adequateireplacements for Arnie Sowell and Jack
Schubert from the team that captured the ﬁrst IC4A cham-

Coach Carl Olson has room for optimism. .

If the veteran mentor is unable to come up with adequate
replacements for these two dependables, thenthere is plenty

of room for pessimism.

Sentiment Never ~
Even Considered

By STEVE, BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 

    

_ 7 Nothing better than the 14-13 victory over the hungry
West Virginians could have happened to the Panthers Satur-
day. The Blue and Gold was lucky, make no mistake about

 

A it. They went to Morgantown wanting to win; the Mounties
~ Wanting to win far more badly.

Luckily, though, the Pantherswere alert on defense. If

_ they had been as uncertain on defense. as they were on of-

fense, the Ridgerunners would have had an easy picking. Respect-

,‘ fully, using true Mountaineer language, it would have been easy
pickin’s. ’

Coach Michelosen’s troops cou1dn’t generate on offense worth

‘ mentioning. They didn’t permit this to interfere with them>"lie-

coming opportunists, however. For a small portion of the third

period when they capitalized two fumbles, they never did any-
thing offensively that merited the win.

In a way, though, this game could be just the ideal standard
with which the Oaklanders can measure their possibilities against
Syracuse Saturday, and the remainder of the opponents on their
schedule that has been called everything from murderous to ludicrous.

The Panther dressing room was happy over the triumph, but not
nearly as one would anticipate. Coach Michelosen and Athletic Di-
rector Tom Hamilton were breathing sighs ‘of relief. It was obvious
that Michelosen was far from pleased at the performance of his
team. He admitted that the Jungle Cats have a distance to go be-
fore they deserve their pre—season ranking. ‘

, Captain Hamilton thinks the Panthers learned a far greater

lesson than if they had won by a much wider margin.‘ “They
found out you have to play, a full 60 minutes if you expect to
win,” offered Hamilton.

West Virginia's dressing room had its crowd of sobering con-
solers, too. Coach Art Lewis was dejected because of the loss. The
players slowly ﬁled out of the darkened runway with heads bowed.
The"'faithfuls condoled them for their loss and they depressingly
replied with reluctant murmurs. It was a tragic defeat for the
Lewismen. They wanted to win so badly. _ A

Developments at College Park, Maryland, found a slight under-
dog Syracuse eleven stun the mighty Maryland Terripans, 26-12.
This is the same Orange aggregation which the Michelosenmen must
face at the Stadium this weekend. It was thought that the Big Orange
had a strong team, but not that conclusively powerful.

Contrasting Syracuse’s triumph with Pitt’s win, we can con-

 clude that the Orangemen will be in precisely the same situation

the Panthers were when they tangled with the Mountaineers. The

' phychological advantage appears to favor the Jungle Cats. They

know. they have to improve and the New Yorkers’ elation could
prove their downfall.

The Panther eleven is much better than they showed Saturday.
What the locals are out to do now is regain their late season com-
posure of a year ago when they were one of the most poised elevens
in the nation. They have a better team and there is no reason why
they can’t or Won’t. .When they recapture that poise and steady
themselves to playing the caliber of ball which they are capable of,
it’s going to cause the opposition many sleepless nights.

And although rampant optimism invariably evolves from sen-
timent, and at times perilously leads to disillusionment, we still
think the Michelosenmen will improve on last year’s 7-3 record.
Peering objectively at the schedule, it will be 9-1 for the season.
You see, we considered sentiment which said 10-0..

Hope Drops 97th a

As Surprised Yogis
. Are Lead Astray

The lives of millions of peo-
hinge on the fulﬁllment of one
word—hope. After all, hope
springs eternal. But, much to
the chagrin of the Pitt News

« Yogis, Hope also lost to a hard-

hitting Heidelberg eleven by the
ignominious score of 41-12.

In another display of rare
form that so characterized their
actions last season, our Swamis
fearlessly went out on a limb
and unanimously selected the
undermanned Hope Dutchmen
to spring the major upset of
the young season. And, true to
form, the Dutchmen went down
to their 97th’ straight. defeat.

Actually, the score is very
misleading of the ferocity and
tenseness of the game. The
Dutchmen had high hopes of
winning and were very much in
the game until the opening
kickoff and then, weary from
their strenuous pre-game warm-
up, began to lose ground to the

superbly , conditioned Student

Princes.

Our peerless star-gazers also
missed the boat on the Notre
Dame-Southern Methodist con-
test by picking the vanquished
Irish to win. Swami Butchock
was last seen heading for the
Aldred Room to check on the
date of the Protestant Reforma-
tion muttering something about
a history prof pleading him
astray.

Only the foresight of Coach

John «Michelson prevented the
Swamis from being whitewash-
ed in another contest. Big-Mike
—-with an eye to next Satur-
day’s game——-was the only
prognosticator to pick under-
dog Syracuse to beat powerful
Maryland. And even Michelosen
didn’t appear too happy when
his selection came through. His
only reply ‘when informed of
this feat was a low moan fol-
lowedlby “Give me the aspirins.

“We’ve only lost two men from
last year’s squad through grad-
u a t i o n and
h a v e a ﬁne

' g r o u p o f
s o p h omores

r e g u lars at

games if we can work ourselves
into top condition.”

And, after Watching the Bemis-
men work out, you’d have to :7:
agree that they’ll be in peak con— 
dition by the beginning of the 1:»?
season.

Competition for starting posi-
tions will be keener this season
than any year in the past. There’s
at least one lettergman striving‘
for each position, with two and
three numeral winners wrestling
for. a couple of places.

Coach Bemis has been striv-
ing defense in his pre-season
drills since the graduation of
Bob Cherry, high-scoring cen-
ter half. But with Jerry Bres-
anelli and Sami Hazou return-

Photo Display Set
To Bring Attention
011 ‘Family of Man’

Edward Steichen’s THE FAM-
ILY OF MAN photographic ex-
hibit, which has attracted world-
wide attention for its outstanding
portrayal of life as lived will go
on display at Carnegie Institute
on October 19, Mr. Gordon Bailey
Washburn, Fine Arts Director,
announced.

THE FAMILY OF MAN has as
its theme the universal oneness
of human beings all over the
world and comprises 503 photo-
graphs by 273 photographers from
68 countries. It will be mounted
on _1l7 large panels, and will be
set u_p in the third floor exhibition
area. ‘

Conceived and directed by
Steichen’ for the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, the
exhibit eﬁectively demonstrates
that the art of photography is a
dynamic process of giving form
to ideas and of explaining man
to man. It was organized by
Steichen as a. mirror of the uni-
versal elements and emotions in
the everydayness of life-—-as a
mirror of the essential oneness
of mankind throughout the
world. _

According to Steichen,_Selection
of photographs, from all parts of
the world, ran through a gamut of
life from birth to death with em-
phasis on the daily relationships
of man to himself, to his family,
to the community and the world
we live in.

Carnegie Institute will observe
special visiting hours during the
exhibit. THE FAMILY OF MAN
will be open to the public until
December 2nd from 10:00 a.m. to
10:00 p.m. daily except on Sun-
days, when it will be shown from
2:00 to 5:00 in the afternoons. A
25 cent admission price is being
observed. School groups and chil-
dren accompanied by adults will
be admitted free of charge.

Milestone Reached Here‘...
In Heart isease Battle  

Another advance in the battle

against the nation’s number one
killer —— heart disease — has been
announced by a team of Univers-
ity of Pittsburgh scientists.

The Pittsburgh‘ researchers re-
port for the ﬁrst time discovery
in the wall of human arteries the
presence of lipoprotein and a
sharp correlation between the
presence of this substance and
degeneration of the arteries.

The research was done by Mar-

Test Lab, “Upstairs”    

Even in aviation’s earliest years, it was axiomatic that “proof
must come in the air". Out of this, the ﬂying test bed was born
. . . ‘and slowly grew to its present-day stature as an indispen-
sable engineering tool, implemented by an extensive variety

of engineering skills.

The problems of observing and recording an engine's per-
formance in the air are legion. Most recently, a Boeing B-50
and a North American B-45 were readied as test beds for
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft’s.J-57 and J-75 turbojets. The
experimental power plant, contained in a retractable pod in
the bomb bay, can be ﬂown to locations where atmospheric
conditions permit most efficient testing. The prototype is
then extended into the air stream for actual ﬂight work with
the regular engines idled, and the job of observing and

recording in-ﬂight performance begins.

From the ﬁrst shakedown ﬂight to the test engine's even-
tual acceptance, invaluable information is gathered. Perhaps
the most vital contribution made by P & W A’s ﬂying test-bed
program is the great reduction in time between initial devel-
opment and quantity production of engines. Important, too,
is the quality and diversity of engineering talent involved in
such a program, for it spells out remarkable opportunity for

%today’s engineering student.
