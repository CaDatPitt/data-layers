mons room tonight at 8 p. In. for the Chancellor’s Reception.

On hand at each of the entrances to the Cathedral, there will
be upperclass men from the ROTC to greet and direct parents to
one of three checkrooms. Here the parents will be met by upper class
women who will assist in the checking. of coats and hats and then
direct the parents to other members of the ROTC corps who will
usher them to their seats for the formal part of the reception.

, At 8:15 p. m. the organ music of Fred Lotz, which will have
given some of the between class atmosphere of the Cathedral to the
visitors, will give way to the words of welcome of Dean Theodore W.
Biddle. Mr. Biddle will be followed to therostrum by Deans Stanton
C. Crawford of the college, Elmer A. Holbrook of the School of En-

sTonHe

 

gineering and Mines, Vincent W:
Lanfear of the School of Business
Administration, Edward C. Rief
of the School of Pharmacy, and
Helen Pool Rush, dean of women.

tionand then-the Chancellor, Dr.
Rufus H. Fitzgerald, will speak.
about the future of the freshmen
at Pitt. The formal program will
be closed by the Men’s chorus and
the Merry Gentlemen quartet un-
der the direction of David G.
VVeiss, singing “Song of the Won-
derlust,” “March of the Men of
Harleeh,” “Russian Picnic,” and
“Hail to ping”

After the close of this part of

. Sponsored by the three most powerful student orgamza.-
tions on campus, ‘Student Congress Panhel, and IF. the hon-
rally promises to have the biggest following of any combined effort

jinx over State's head that inevitably buckles them under any Pitt
onslaught.

Planned as a rally and not as _a
social entertainment event, the
bon-ﬁre gathering promises a pro-
gram of songs, yells, and all-out
racket to set Shadyside rocking.

“Ike” Icardi, head cheerleader
when Pitt was the ‘cock of the
walk’ in football circles back at
the turn of the decade, will be

, back in the driver’s seat probing

cheers from the victory-hungry
Pittites.

“Ike,” with the shining head,
says, “This sure sounds like" the
good old days. Why, I can remem-
ber when We didn’t stop at our
rallys ’til all of Oakland shook.
I _think the kids have something
this time.”

According to reports from the
program committee, students are
asked to meet at the vacant lot
between the Syria Mosque and
Bi-gelow Boulevard at 7:45 p.m.
with their unlighted torches.

Recommendations for making
torches, by Bob Ingram, include:
take an old broom stick, wrap it
thoroughly with old rags. Tie _the
rags on securely with wire, and
be sure to keep the globe of in-
ﬂammable material well toward
the top of the stick.

The committee has arranged for
a 55 gallon drum" of kerosene to
be on hand at the vacant lot
where the parade will form. For
safety purposes the torches are
not to be lighted except at the
starting place, and then only by
the main t0rch—bearer.

From the vacant lot out—post.

Bayard Street to Shadyside, and
then pile onto the ﬁeld at Ells-
worth Center.

A bonﬁre, “bright as J & L I

Steel,” says Ingram, will be roar-
ing soon after the hundreds of
torches are ﬂung at the stacked
wood.

“After the ﬁre dies down, but
when the spirits are still high,
students will trapse back to Oak-
land to the fraternity and sorority
houses for open-house affairs,”
reports Paul Steinlauf.

Ellsworth Center cafeteria will
be equipped with a juke box for
dancing, and it too will be thrown
open to the students. Congress has
arranged for the Center juke box.

Finally, a damper. I.n case of
rain after 4 p.m. this afternoon,
the rally will be cancelled.

‘Like 0111 Times,’t

Seems like old times. “Independents Plan
. . .,” that’s the way the headline ran.‘ Time
was, and not so long ago either, that a head-
line that started with “Independents . . . ”
received quite a bit of attention here on campus.

That was back in the ancient days of the
1940-41 pre-war era and the Independents
were THE campus organization. Under the
guiding spirit of such men as Jack Hoevler and
Aldo Icardi the Independents sponsored dances

’ and socials, participated mightily in school ac-

tivities, and helped run (some say there was
no “helping” about it,,they “ran”) the Stu-
-dent-Faculty Association. -

A Plans are now under way to revive the war-
dissolved Independents. We hope .the revival
is a thumping success. The Independents have

a place, an important place among a student

body as large as Pitt’s.

It will take more, however, than just the"
initiative of a few students, more than a great
number of student members in such an organi-
zation to insure this success. It will take intel-
ligent leadership, sound policies, and sincere
cooperation among its members.

It will take an organization with a posi-
tive program, such as helping the non—fra.1:ernity
students to a greater share - of _ college life,
not one with a negative approach, such as de-
feating at every turn fraternity-sponsored poli-
cies and events simply because they are “fra-
ternity.” ' I ~ V

It will mean the avoidance of cliques, such
as veter'ans,‘within the organization so that it
may function as a really “Independent”
group. -

A It will take time and hard work. We hope
the Independents persevere and come back.
We’ve missed them.

Cordial to State

/' One thing that we talk about at Pitt is »

going to the games and supporting the team.
This Saturday when Pitt meets Penn State,
the student body invades Smoky Town en-
masse. ‘ I

In comparing the wonderful receptionand
the abundant cordiality Pitt ‘received at Mich-
igan with the cold, aloof and very uncordial
reception served Pittites at Purdue, we realize
what it means for a team and a stu entbody
to be well received by their opponent.

The Hatchet Hop, an after-the-brawlvrdance,
this Saturday at Syria Mosque, is a step in the
right direction. The welcome mat is out for
everyone, and everyone will be there.

Let’s be cordial; let’s be friendly; let’s

' show Penn State students a good time.

Panlherhurgerf

Humor Magaziaiewilor Says

Editor’s Note: The following article is straight from the horse’s
mouth. Last week, we sent a letter to the State “Daily Collegian”
editor for his opinion. After due consideration, the editor up there
assigned his huddle, Art Stober, editor. of the college humor magazine,
the task of fabricating a tale of State’s strength. We feel that it is in
the interests of competition, certainly not better journalism‘ standards,

that we print this “tall story.”

They ’re planning to have lion steaks for Thansksgiving down
in Pittsburgh. But‘ from the top of Mt. Nittany it looks as though

they better start orderingmustard, for the bill of fare will

more likely be topped by Pantherburgers.

For this week——more than any¢
other time this season, or perhaps
any other season‘ — Penn Statefs
mighty, mobile football jugger-
naught is in high gear. That na-
tionally—laud.ed Navy victory last
Saturday in Ba1timore’s puddle-
bedecked Municipal Stadium just
hinted at the hoard of power stor-
ed under those Blue & White jer-
seys. n

It makes this .week’s contest
look like an open and shut case
for the “Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Small Children.”
Pitt’s team will probably come
out of this game looking like the
Tower of Learning fell on them.

To cdnsole themselves, 'they’re
talking about having the Indian
sign on State down at. Pitt, about
our _being- jinxed. voo-dooed, hex-
ed, and about their good luck. This
Saturday Co—captains Johnny No-
lan and Potsklan aren’t going to
spend their time praying to voo-
doo gods or hoping for a, hex.
They’re going to be playing foot-
ba1l—a tougher, more vicious
brand of ball than Pitt’s limping
Panther has had the misfortune to

And they needn’t pray for rain
in the “Smoky City,” either. It

was one thought that mud was
the greatest equalizer in football.
After sloshing through two muddy
victories in as many weeks, Penn
S t a t e ’ s gazell-leged backﬁeld
looks as though it could sprint to
TD’s in the middle of the Monon-
gahela River. .

Yes, Penn State is gunning for
Pittsburgh. There are more than
a dozen scoring backs waiting to
be unleashed against that Pan-
ther. The nation’s top line is dig-
ing in. and they mean business.
(It’s interesting to note that Navy
center Dick Scott rates Penn
State’s line greater than that of
Notre Dame’s — that Irish line
pushed Pittsburgh around to the
tune of 40-6).

From all indications it looks’ as
though the only way Pitt will be

able to keep down the score is to

diplomatically not show up at the
Stadium and write it off as-a 1-0
loss.

But what is more important,
Saturday’s victory will mark Penn
State’s ﬁrst perfect season since
1913. Marshall Goldberg and the
entire Steeler forward wall
cou1dn’t~ stop Bob Higgins from
materializing that dream now.

Letters To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt -News:

Evidently your editorial of last
week pertaining to the Henry
Wallace meeting, for which you
shouted, in a mistaken notion of
liberality of thought or of other
advantages, had an -inviting ef-
fect on the reds, pinks and punks.
They ﬂocked by the hundreds to
hear Wallace condemn his own
nation and its. government. Con:
sidering the tenseness of the pres-
entworld situation, his utterances
tend to make war more and more
inevitable.

Mr. Wallace is now playing a
part similar to that of the treach-
erous naturalized “American”
citizen' Fritz Kuhn of 1938 and
__l939, and the organization which
Henry Wallace represents is sub-
‘fstituting the part of that “Ger-
man American -Bund.” ;

Fritz ‘Of 1938-rqutxtedsr Goebbels’

, “Vdlksisher

Bobachter” while
Henry of 1947 quotes, but does not
say he quotes, “Pravda” and “Iz-
vestia,” both Russian government
owned and controlled communist
plblications. They‘ quote Wallace
continually. I know because I read
them. H.

_H.is speech at Syria Mosque last
Monday night was nothing less
than a verbatim reiteration of
what “Pravda” and “lzvestia”
have been telling the Russian peo-
ple for the past eighteen months.
The only difference is that Wal-
lace used the words “Wall Street”
more frequently than either of the
Russian (mblications.

In his audience was a fairly
large. number of clergymen. Isn’t
it about time that the clergy
-should awaken to the dangers of
communism? '

"Replacements were "ﬁlled by
men who had‘the next highest

Congress Approves

NSA Membership

_ Student. Congress, last Tuesday, put its OK on the move to
incorporate the Pitt student body in the National Association.
Congress accepted the report of investigation of the national
group and, with it, the motion to place “appointment of one or two
delegates to observe next summer"s conference” ﬁrst on the agenda
of the 1948-49 Student Congress.
The second part of the motion, calling for immediate corres-

bership. 9
The proposed change calls for
Congress to be made up of ten
men and ﬁve women. Women
members would be the president
of WSGA, ex-ofﬁcio; two seniors
and two juniors. Men student
members would include the presi-
dent of 'Men’s Council, ex-ofﬁcio,
a i-epresentafcive s en i or from
M~en’s Council, four seniors, and

four juniors. '

Signatures ‘well over the five
hundred required to present the
petition to Congress have already
been secured. Congress will re-
ceive the paper at its next meet-
ing, Tuesday, Nov. 25, and will
then set a date for student voting
on the suggested amendment.

Fraternities

Reserve Seats

Cap and Gown is offering block
tickets to fraternities, sororities
and honorary groups for any per-
formance of “Mabe1’s Fable.”

Letters have been sent to all
fraternities asking them to select
a date for their ticket reservation.
Tickets will be available Wednes-
day ONLY at the ground ﬂoor
ticket b‘ooth. =

_ Organization members need on-
ly ask for tickets in their organ-
ization’s reserved section and pre-
sent identiﬁcation cards and ac-
tivities tickets. Under-graduates
may purchase two ti-ckets for the
reduced price of one dollar each.

Independents
Meeting Due
Today at‘Noon

The hue and cry will be heard
today ﬁfth and sixth hours when
the Independents of the Univer-
sity hold a meeting in 324 C1. and
G—24 Cl., respectively. Ken Hall,
‘president of Carnegie Tech’s in-
dependent organization, Citcom
Clan, will address both meetings.

Stu Workmaster, acting publici-
_ty agent of the Independents, and
Harry Pluebell, acting chairman,
say that Hall’s experience will il-

lustrate “the pitfalls which our.

organization might fall into—such
as premature boasts of ascension
to the political powers in Student
Congress.”

All Independents are invited.

Plan ‘Hatchet Hop’ .

Kitty O’Hagan really came close. to Jack Lohman when she be-
labored him with a hatchet for the Hatchet Hop committee. The
pseudo-hair Miss O’Hagan holds is for demonstration purposes only.

Balm for the wounds of the Penn State lion and stew for the
Pitt Panther is to be provided at the post game “Hatchet Hop” in
Syria Mosque.

Paul Steinlauf, chairman of lF’s Social Committee planning the
dance, wants to make it clear that it is the Pitt team that is expected
to do the hatcheting. The “Bury the Hatchet” theme is merely to
comfort the Penn State students who are expected to attend the
dance. ‘ I -

Dancing, which begins immediately after the game and will
last until 6:30 p. m., will be to the music of the always popular Bill
LeRoy. It is open to all Pitt and Penn State students, alumni, and
their guests. ' '

Something hew in publicity stunts is expected to make those at

the game well aware of the fun that is to follow.

The main stated purposes of the

Angeline  Does Well,

In Stadium Romance

Football fanswill witness the

Pitt varsity band depictwa story-

book romance. by way of formations and music during the half-time

intermission of the- Panther-Lion

foray tomorrow afternoon.

Asisted by the stadium public address system, the marching
musicians will portray the tale of “Angeline” from nativity “until

they live happily ever after.”

Band Director Robert L. Arthur will conduct the band from the
west side of the stadium, a-nd Assistant Director Alfred C. Ackenheil

from the east.

The sequence of the story with special music___ adaptations and‘

descriptive formations will be done in this fashi_on.:~

“Once upon a time, alittle baby’
girl was born. She was a sweet
litle baby, and her parents call-
ed her Angeline. (The band forms
a cradle facing l_E1ast, and plays
“Rock—a—Bye Baby”).

Older and Bolder

“But Angeline grew” up, and as
she grew older and bolder, she di-
rected her sweetness to the boys

break their hearts had all the poor
boys and their mothers calling her
“Naughty Angeline.” (In cartoon
style, the band shapes into the

large heart and plays “Naughty
Angeline’)

“When she was graduated from
college, Angeline decided to move
South, but her reputation follow-
ed~ her. Soon Angeline became

known as ‘The Lady from‘ 29
Palms.’ (The formation changes
by replacing the heart with a palm
tree. The music is “The Lady from
29 Palms.”)\
Then One Night

“One night Angeline was out
walking under the palms when a
dark handsome man stepped up
to her and said, ‘All I want is to

tion of Jerome Kern’s “The Way

solo cornet part by Don Lautner.)

“Now. Angeline was only hu-
man, so it wasn’t long until they
were married, and they lived hap-
pily ever after intheir sweet lit-
tle home. (The outline of a house
is formed and an abbreviated Ver-
sion of “Home, Sweet Home” is
played. The band then moves
quickly and silently into the
words “The End” and plays ﬁnale
music. On the last chord it spreads
the words “The End” over a much
larger area of the ﬁeld and then re-
turns to the band block.)

“The Male Animal,” by Eliott

his liberal views in the face of
dire threats from both the faculty

origin. A

The nucleus of the council was
obtained from volunteers who
answered the call for members.

Announcement of the group’s for-

mation appear-ed on the Ellsworth
bulletin boards in’ the early days
of this semester.

It is those men who attended
early meetings and set the organ-
ization on its feet who are now
determining the present and fu-
ture efforts of the council.

"Pige Ke Naralka" ls 
Malayan- Not Greek

Burton Butker, political science major and junior in the College,
is a man in a million-—he can talk back to his wife.

Being a political science major has nothing to do A with this,
nor is it an ability peculiar to college juniors. Burt’s technique is
simply to slip into Malayan when he finds himself on the losing end
of the conversation. Since Mr. B. can neither speak nor understand
ll/Ialaya-n, he is on reasonably safe ground there.

This all started In Sanspor, Netherlands East Indies, where the
days were long and hot, and there wasn’t much for a soldier of the
United States Army to do." ‘ ’ ‘

Watching a bunch of natives chattering in their mother tongue
one day, Burt began to think that
it would be wonderful if he. could
understand what theywere saying.
So he walked up to the group, and
by making‘ gestures and'- talking
his best brand of pidgin English
made them understand that he
wanted to learn their language.

‘Making motions to suggest an
object, then’ having the natives
tell him their word for it, he in-
creased‘ his Malayan vocabulary
day by day. Several months later,
he met a Javanese ofﬁcer of the
Dutch Army who advised him to
send to Australia for books in
Malayan, and soonihe was pro-
ﬁcient enough to read these. Talk-
ing with the island people con-
stantly, he mastered, the language
after only eight months.

Some of his friends started to
learn Malayan after he told them
of his intentions, but because of
the terrific heat and the diﬁicul-
ty of the language, they all ran
out of initiative.‘ “It’sa very com-
plicated language,” Burt says, V .  _ _ ,
“one of the most diﬂicult in the Burg Butker
world, since every word in. Ma- S éaks Mala n
layan represents a picture.” p * * * ya —-..

It is alsohard because the Ma-
layan spoken by the higher class,
such asthe native officers of the
Dutch Army, and that spoken by
the common people, may contain
different words for the same thing.

Now back in the United States,
Burt doesn’t have much chance to

 

tern, so he resigned. Nowl he
plans to turn his linguistic ability
into new channels. He intends to’
teach Malayan to the family’s new
addition, Frederick, so he can
make use of him as an ally, in fam-
ily disputes. ‘

Determined Push
Needed for Tilt .

Pitt reverted to the old theory that the best defense is a
good offense which probably accounts for the optimism these
days up on the hill.

This new conﬁdence was embodied in a statement by Head
Coach Mike Milligan who said, “I believe that we can win if

we get offense-minded. ”

up. Now, we have just two games
left and can go all out. The boys
.feel they can beat State.”

The remainder of the coaching
staff is in complete agreement.
There is a healthy conﬁdence, the

kind that wins games, at the prac- ,

tice sessions. Every man on the
ﬁeld knows just what he is work-
ing for.

Except for two or three new
faces in the line, State’s Lions are
virtually the same team which lost
last season’s wind-up in the Sta-
dium. Remembering last year’s 14-
7 defeat, they’ll be plenty tight.

Glenn S. (Pop) Warner, head
grid coach at Pitt from 1915
through 1923, will be a spectator
at tomorrow’s game.

Small wonder. The Lions have eleven men, backed by eleven
more and eleven more. They’re all good. They have crushed most

of their opponents. _But think.

State swamped Fordham, Bucknell, Colgate, Syracuse, teams that
are far from major grid powers. When the Staters tackled stronger
squads, Temple, Navy, West Virginia, things didn’t go so easily.

We at Pitt know of our impish jinx. So do the Lions who

learned from bitter experience not¢

tiful1y—successful record, prema-
turely tucked away.

Coach Williams also reports
that the Lion coaching staff is
“worried about the Pitt game.”
Penn State knows about the jinx
all right. but, can they do any-
thing about it?

Have Seven Good Backs

In the attempt, Penn State
Coach Bob Higgins will send at
least seven good backs at the Pan-
thers.

State’s most noted and least
used runner is Larry Joe, 185-
pound speedster. Joe comes into
the, game only long enough to set
the Lions aﬁre with one of his
long dashes, then retires to the
sidelines.

Halfback Jeff Durkota led the
Nittanymen to the triumph last
week over Navy, breaking away
for two 40-yard touchdown
sprints. . / ,

State boasts one of the top
punters in the nation in Fullback
Joe Colone. Colone also does a
terriﬁc job of line plunging, as
does his understudy, Francis
Rogel, the cream of the crop

As a savage defensive line-

Charley Drazenovich is unmatch-

His smaller brother, Joe, at a

Much of tomorrow’s hope for an

The best passer on the squad,
Paul’s efforts will determine the

‘ The Wheeling Whip hasn’t yet

Locals Win 'B'
Championship

A blocked kick by right end,
Tom Laboon, set up the lone
touchdown for the Locals of the
Independent league as they edged
the YMCA gridders, 6-0, at Trees
Field Tuesday.

The clash determined the sec-

tion B champion. The win quali-
ﬁed the Locals for a crack at the
league title and a chance for IM
honors.
. In the fourth quarter Laboon
rushed Paul Dulack, kicking for
the Y’s on their own ten, deflect-
ed the ball with his arm and re-
covered the elusive pigskin on
the five.

Pepped—u.p by this break, Bob
Br-ubaker, lobbed a wobbly pass
that was completed to “Jocko”
Ruth in the end zone for the
winning score.

The only serious threat the los-
ers made came in the second
quarter. Four straight pass plays
failed to dent the Local defense,
and they lost the ball on downs.

  All Art Types Shown

In Serigraph Exhibit

By William Brezger

Something different in art went on display this week in the
fine arts gallery. A series of 50 serigraphs, or silk screen prints,
are displayed there as the second of this year’s art exhibits.

The display represents the work of 40 contemporary American
artists outstanding in t.he ﬁeld of serigraphy, and covers a Variety
of subjects representing, for the most part, the American scene.

Fundamentally serigraphs are paintings stenciled on a silk base.

Accompanying the display is an9

educational_ unit that explains
their execution step by step.
Outstanding among the works
on display are two scenes of to-
bacco farming‘ by Pittsburgher

Robert Gwathmey, once a prizel

winner in the Carnegie fall show.
“Tobacco Topping” and “Tobacco
Farmers” are interesting for their

display of solid colors, a good use‘

of the silk screen process.

For the connossieurs of modern

art, the exhibition carries several
abstractions. James McConnell
has contributed two of these as
“Sister Kate" and “Mixed Trio.”
They are notable for their Violent
reds and blues. .
_ More subtle in coloring is Mor-
ris Blackburns abstraction, “Re-
verse Movements.”
‘to be observing the observer
through crossed eyes.

Almost abstract is Ruth Gikow’s

idea of “Coney Island,” that some- l

how doesn’t seem to capture the
flavor of its namesake. Unfortun-
ately‘, the work is somewhat vague
and not clear as to its type. Doris
Meltzer offers a pair oi scenes rep-
resenting Jones Beach, and there

is a slightly distorted view of Bos— r
ton’s Old North Church. The lat-’

tcr is commendable for its use
of olive and terracotta shadings.
The usual animal sketches are
there, too. “Poody" is a big black
cat by Ray Euﬁfa, and there are

characters have no faces. .
