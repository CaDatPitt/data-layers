intervention in life
and death matters

ByTim Hunter
The Pitt News

The right to create or destroy life
was the focus of serious discussion
between Catholic, Protestant, and
Jewish panelists, Monday night,
before a large audience.

The panel discussion entitled
“Playing God: Choices in Medical
Ethics,” was sponsored by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Chaplain’s
Association.

Panelists included Dr. Jack Gal-
lagher, a Roman Catholic priest and
associate professor at the Toronto
School of Theology, Dr. William F.
May, a Presbyterian minister and
senior professor of Christian ethics
at Georgetown's Kennedy Center,
and Dr. Ellen Frank, a member of
the Jewish faith and assistant profes-
sor of psychiatry at the University of
Pittburgh School of Medicine.

“The notion that there is one right
and one wrong is foreign to Jewish
tradition," Frank said on the subject
of abortion. “The fetus is considered
an organic part of the mother, and
it's destruction is condemned unless
the pregnancy becomes a threat to
the mother‘s life. Therapeutic abor-
tions are required of Jewish people
when the mother's life is at stake.”

Gallagher gave another
perspective.

“In general,” he said, “the Roman
Catholic tradition has become a lot
more mixed up in science and philo-
sophy. We are more concerned with
the philosophical concept of person-
hood." He added that Catholics feel
“personhood begins at fertilization
— the conviction that to be an indi-
vidual is in fact to be that living
organism. The person begins when
that organism begins."

Life, according to May, is a fun-
damental good derived from God.
“It is hard for me to side with pro-
choicers who feel that because a per-
son chooses to have an abortion, it
makes that act right. lt is also hard
for me to side with pro-lifers who do
not consider the opinions of women
in such cases as rape and incest,” he
admitted. “

“There are also problems. when
people become pro-lifers for only
nine months. Too often, this society
does nothing to support and care for
the mother of a newborn." May
stressed there should be a distinction
between what one’s views are mor-
ally and what one will do legally.
“We should maintain our moral
views toward abortion,” he said.
“However, we shouldn‘t try to make
those views a constitutional
ammendment.”

On the topic of artificial insemina-
tion, Gallagher spoke in a more gen-
eral context. Animals breed and
reproduce, he said, but humans pro-
create through not only genetic
endowment but also through the
“incidental generosity found in the
strong institution of the family.”

“Once people stop enriching their
liyes thrgugh thjefamily institution
our civilization will end,” he said.
“Reproductive methodssuch as sur-“
rogate motherhood have a funda-
mental effect‘ on
institution."

“Something that is good for indi-
viduals but erodes this institution
should not be pursued,” he" said.

May provided the audience with
examples of society's dependence on
institutions such as the family which
include care of the elderly.

May said he did not find anything
wrong with in vitro fertilization.
“Once the first one was successful,

the risk was over.” May said he
opposes state planning that tells
people how many children they can
have.

Frank said she agreed with the
necessity of maintaining the family
institution and its strong procreative
force. The bond between the hus-
band and wife is especially impor-
tant, she added. “Artificial
insemination from a donor is
frowned upon because it severs the

link between that bond and procrea- A

tion,” she said.

“As a clinician,” Frank said, “I’ve
seen the really heart-breaking pain
of a couple who cannot conceive
children. They are really uplifted
when they can procreate through
artificial inseminationor in vitro fer-
tilization. If something appears that
can contribute to the institution of
.the family then it is good."

. Euthanasia and infantacide were
also topics of intense discussion.

“We are presently faced with a
huge irony,” May said. “Most peo-
ple prefer to go quickly. At the same
time, we generate new diagnostic
and "therapeutic procedures for
avoiding death.

‘We are presently faced with a huge irony.
Most people prefer to go quickly.

——Dr. William F. _May

May added it is important for hos-
pitals to set up policies which distin-
guish between maximal treatment
and optimalcare.

“They’re not always the same,” he
explained. “Physicians should be
allowed to withdraw all curative
efforts,«from the machine to penicil-

. lin, but they should not withdraw

care for the patient."

May said he is against the so-
called mercy killing except maybe in
extreme cases such as on a
battlefield.

Frank said she is fascinated with
the laws that were set down
thousands of years ago and still
apply today. “Active euthanasia,
including extreme cases, is a crime,"
,she said.

“Jewish tradition has set aside a
speciﬁc state —— death is imminent at

the point when the patient will not
live more than three days. When this
state is reached, it is required for
Jewish people to remove that which
will hinder death,” she explained.

“Personally I don’t distinguish
between passive and active euthana-
sia," Gallagher said. “There is no
difference between the two for they
both have the same goal.” As far as
prolonging life, Gallagher said he
feels the factors considered should
be purified.

Painful suffering is a factor, he
said, but not necessarily the quality
of life. It is hard for us to judge the
quality of the patient’s life.

Despite such different views, the ‘

panelists agreed they should not let
their differences prevent them from
a common front toward ending the
ethical problems of today.

Opinions expressed in columns

The Pitt News staff.

Published three times weekly

from May to early August.

The Party’s Over

President Reagan has long accused the press of offering the
American people a slanted, overly liberal view ofthe news. At-
the same time, Reagan has benefited from his easy access to the
White House press corps during the past three years.

During a recent press conference, as the president finished
his prepared text and the reporters began their questioning,
who should sneak up behind the president but Nancy. With a
birthday cake in hand, Nancy quickly turned the press confer-
ence into an episode of politicking and -grandstanding.

This episode, and others like it, demonstrate a serious abuse
of the free media access granted to the president; a privilege
designed to facilitate the communication between the president
and the people, not to simply provide good public relations for
the president.

Reagan has successfully used the press to convey an image of
himself as an all-American cowboy — virtuous, proud and
defiant. Members of the press have admitted they're being
manipulated but contend that he’s “such a likeable guy" that
their efforts at tougher coverage are futile.

This Sunday’s appearance by Reagan, intended to launch his
re-election campaign, showed a new and encouraging direction
by the media. Reagan had requested free air time to announce
his candidacy, but the networks refused the request.

Reagan considered working his announcement into a press
conference, but the networksiheld fast and again refused to be
caught up in another Reagan prime-time publicity stunt.

The networks asked for and received an estimated $400,000
for Reagan's five-minute announcement. The test of an inde-
pendent news service will come later this year when the White
House will surely step up its attempts to take advantage offree
TV coverage. We wholeheartedly support the networks in their
effort to provide impartial and fair campaign coverage.

Cheap Justice

The long arm ofthe law doesn’t reach very far in Pittsburgh
any more.

A new ruling on court scheduling threatens to do away with
the pressing backlog of cases facing local judges by doing away
with the crimes.’ Rather than establishing six new seats for
judges, the judicial system will bend to dismiss cases involving
“lesser” crimes in favor of going after the bigger fish.

Some crimes being considered for dismissal are relatively

lminor, but the majority are not. These include child abuse,

drunken driving, refusal to pay child support, carrying explo-
sives, assault and prowling. This is approximately one quarter
of the caseload, according to a Jan. 25 article in The Pittsburgh
Press. p T

This hasty response to the spiraling number of crimes only
serves to cut down the number of court cases, but as usual, it
ignores the real problem. » A

If the theory that punishment deters crime ever had any truth
to it, it certainly won't deter many future violators. The real
rub, however, comes upon examining the contradiction
between the scheduling ruling and the proud crusade being

conducted against drunk driving. lt nullifies the impact such‘

organizations as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)

- might have had. Thecfamilies of victims are understandably

angry that injustices done to them would take a back seat to the
importance of running a smooth, assembly-line legal system.

When the courts are as overload-ed as they are now, it’s a
signal that something is drastically wrong. The solution is not

to make a quick cosmetic fix but to think in the long term for

once. its a question of priorities. To offer this solution in place
ofan effective solution (which would require thought, time and
possibly money) is to take the easy way out and cheat society in
the end. \ 4 .

To dismiss any crime as “minor” when it clearly isn’t is a
crime against the victim.

Letters To The Editor

Cartoonist
plays into the

hands of the
police

l hope no Pitt students are ever
assaulted by one, let alone several,
police officers. ln court, that can be
like fighting “Big Brother." But the
innocent parties won this time,
thanks largely to the well-planned
and diligently carried—out prepara-
tion by the two assaulted football
players and their lawyers. They did
not make the mistake ofmaking sen-
sational comments during the long
wait before the trial.

But several months ago. an editor-
ial cartoon in The Pitt News did not
have to wait forvthe outcome of the
trial to find the players guilty. Mark
Schneidmiller’s half-page illustra-
tion of Atiyeh and Puzzuoli stand-
ing over the unconscious bodies ofa
policeman saying “Da. we are
tough" was a deliberate. hurtful
crime, not just against all football
players, notjust against the two peo-
ple hurt by this pretrial propaganda.
but against all of us at Pitt.

It was wrong because he found
them guilty just because of the po-
lice‘s incredible claims, it was wrong
because anyone who lives here
knows, with only rare exceptions,

football players are always low vis--
ibility, decently-behaved students
for scholarship and team regula-
tions. Mostly, it was wrong because
Mark Schneidmiller played right
into the police’s hands, sensational-
izing. “the official word“ when the
two defendants wisely did not give
their story until now.

Of course, we cannot live without
police; and of course, the real truth
of what happened that night lies
somewhere in between the stories of
both sides.

‘Mysterious

Some things never change: snow
still falls fromthe sky in the winter.
flowers still bloom in the spring, and
The Pitt News still produces irre-
sponsiblejournalism throughout the
year, l am a pessimist in regard to
your paper. Under the past adminis-
tration, the paper lost all credibility.
if it ever had any. Under your new
administration. as evidenced by the
cartoon depicting Ken Stram as an
idiot, it seems like the trend of irre-
sponsibility will continue.

l am not, however, an optimist in
this regard, as I stated previously: I
expectno better. If I were living in
the Middle Ages, I would simply
believe that there was a “mysterious
force" out there that renders The
Pitt News incapable of presenting
educated journalism.

A word to the wise. If you were
working for a major newspaper and
allowed a cartoon of such stupidity
like the one depicting Ken Stram to
be published for absolutely no rea-
son, you would very quickly have
learned the legal meaning of slander
and libel.

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

Never has there_been a debate as
heated and as obvious as that over
the inherent dangers of cigarette
smoking. There may be other issues
that can arouse discussions, those
leading in turn to settlement by gun-
shot wounds and the like. Take for
instance abortion. non-stop troubles
in the Mideast. poverty in America
and whether California girls really
are the best in the land. _

But never has the argument been
as one-sided as that over the slowly-
induced death by smoking. The big
tobacco producers have been trying
to bolster a fallacious argument,
when actually only one platform
exists: smoke for the rest ofyour life,
and you'll never realize how long
you really could have stayed alive.

The latest battlelines have been

erected by the R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co.. makers of various
brands of white. four—inch long

cancer sticks. Sponsoring ads in
Newsweek and Time this week, Rey-
nolds headlines this page-long graf-
fiti with "Can We Have An Open
Debate About Smoking?“

This latest commercial blitz is in
obvious response to San Francisco’s
Proposition P, passed last
November, and last week‘s 20th
anniversary of the Surgeon Gener-
a.l‘s anti-smoking report. A little
background will explain Reynolds‘
latest offensive front.

In a’ referendum passed by the
rational residents of San Francisco,
Proposition P will restrict, starting
March l, the number ofareas smok-
ers can infringe upon the clean—air
rights of innocent bystanders. inno-
cent in the sense they mistakenly
believe they are forced to brcath.the
noxious fumes from arrogant
cigarette smokers.

Within the metropolitan confines.

Cigaretteargument up in smoke

those addicted to cigarettes must vir-
tually limit their slow death practice
to private homes. Heavy smoking
restrictions will apply to restaurants,
museums, malls and office build-
ings, you name it.

More convincing than Proposi-
tion P are the Surgeon General.'s
initial findings on smoking's health
hazards in I964. Although 53 mil-
lion Americans still consume over
600 billion cigarettesga year, 30 mil-
lion people in 20 years’ time have
opted not to ﬂick their Bics.

Obviously, these two happenings
are to the dismay of R.J. Reynolds,
Southern—based and licensed killers
of those eventually afflicted with

and cancer. If people who buy their
products eventually want all these
wonderful and terminal things to
happen to them. fine. Let ‘em die.

Greeks collect for charities,

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

l’itt‘s Greeks will kick off their
annual Greek Week Friday. Feb. 3,
with a wine and cheese party that
will be attended by fraternity and
sorority leaders. representatives of
the university and local TV person-
ality Jack Bogut, who is tentatively
scheduled to be on hand.

Pitt’s Greek Week. which will be
held March l—8. will donate its pro-
ceeds to a new charity this year,
Oakland’s Family House. The fra-
ternities and sororities at Pitt raised
$48,000 last year. which was
donated to the Arthritis Founda-
tion.

According to Cheryl Perpetua.
one of this year‘s Greek Week co-
chairmen. other charities were con-
sidered for this year but the Family
House was chosen for a number of
reasons. Perpetua said the charity is
willing to work with the Greeks and
in doing so will bring exposure to

‘both groups.

An animalrights group —— Animal Liberation Front — has

She also said the Greeks made
their decision based on the fact that
the Family House is a local charity,
so the university people who con-
tribute will be able to see their
money in action. She explained that
in the past. most ofthe money Pitt’s
Greeks raised went towards research
that wasn’t university connected or
showed tangible results.

“They were new and promised
they would do things for us and with
us.” Perpetua said. “At first. it was
something unusual. but now. eve-
ryone’s enthusiastic, and we are see-
ing the same kind of support as in
the past.”

Perpetua said that in addition to
having a new sponsor, other aspects
of Greek Week are alsodifferent this
year. The biggest difference is the
way the competition points between
the fraternities and sororities will be
totalled.

ln the past, the amount ofcharity,

year. the dance—a—thon will count for
more points than the Greek sing
when the points are totaled.

Also new this year is a Greek
greeters program that the fraterni-
ties and sororities will become
involved with during the month of
February. The Greeks will serve as
“a sort of communications service."
Perpetua said. They will help out at
Family House. doing a variety of
jobs in addition to serving as recep-
tionists for visitors.

Greek Week activities started ear-
lier this year when Pitt’s Greeks par-
ticipated in the great Pitt—Penn State
blood drive. The early start has
helped the Greeks accumulate
almost twice the number blood
donations that they had this time
last year, Perpetua said.

“Hopefully. we will raise more in
all areas; Family House is something
new, and we really want this to be a
success.“

The kickoff ceremony will be held
in the Grand Ballroom of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union at noon.

By Marty Willis
The Pitt News

[)uring this year‘s icy winter
break. most of us at Pitt could only‘
dream of getting away to aitropical
Caribbean island. Not Jose Moreno.
The Cuban—borin professor. a
member of Pitt’s sociology depart-
ment since I967. spent eight days in
the Dominican Republicjust before
Christmas.

Moreno’s trip, however. was not a
typical vacation. As a recognized
scholar of Dominican society. he
was invited to Santo Domingo to
become the newest member of the
Dominican Academy of Sciences.

“I see it as a real honor for me and
for the University of Pittsburgh that
I was inducted. especially since I'm a
foreigner,” Moreno said. He
explained there have been only four
or five other members in the presti-
gious Academy who were not native
Dominicans.

“My research really has produced
an impact in intellectual circles
within the country," Moreno. said.
citing in particular his book on the
abortive Dominican Revolution of
1965. “Barrios in Arms." published
in I970 by the University of Pitts-
burgh Press.

As a Cornell University doctoral
student. Moreno was doing research
in the Dominican Republic in April.
1965. when the revolution broke

, out.

“That changed my life." he said. “I
stopped doing my research on for-
mal organizations and spent the
next four months working in the
rebel zone in Santo Domingo."

Moreno explained this experience
in “Barrios" when he wrote. “I real-
ized that I was the only trained soci-
ologist in the rebel zone and that
events were occurring around me
which I had a responsibility to the
profession to describe and analyze.

"It was not only scientific curios-
ity that drew mc into an active role in
these events; I felt an obligation to
the community to help wherever
possible to solve the national crisis.

as well. “Tome. all subjects are not
equally interesting and important.
I'm interested in subjects that have
in them a human content and pas-
sion.“ He explained that his scien-

‘l was born among
the outsiders, and the

" fact that I have made

it into the insiders
does not necessarily
mean I have changed
my ideas.’

-Jose M oreno

“I felt that I was shut out of the
Cuban Revolution because I hap-
pened to be in ‘Europe and the U.S.
at the time it happened. I was very
frustrated.“ Moreno explained.

Richard Wilson, a fellow Pitt
sociology professor. said he read
Moreno‘s book as a doctoral student
at Harvard University and was
impressed.

“It was an excellent first—hand
account, which is fairly rare in soci-
ology.“ Wilson siad.

Moreno. who worked for several
years as a Roman Catholic priest
before studying sociology. describes
himself as “a committed academic.“
He said he is not content merely to
understand society but hopes to
make a contribution to improving it

sociology of revolutions. of ideolo-

Although he has always strived
for objectivity in his work. Moreno
said he is well aware that a purely
objective analysis of human affairs
can never be achieved.

“I don’t believe it exists. We real-

ize that we can never completely
eliminate our own values. Each per-
son brings a set of historical and
personal experiences that cannot be
totally separated from his analysis."
he said.

One such experience that influ-
enced him permanently was his time

The First Amendment belongs to
everyone ‘

A Gallup Poll done for the First Amendment Congress, a commit-
tee made up of national journalism organizations, showed a positive
correlation between those who have had bad experiences with the
media and those who favor more regulation of the press.

lt also found that most people form their views of the press accord-
ing to how often their local newspapers, radio and TV stations mis-
spell their names, misunderstand newsabout their business, fail to tell
all sides of an issue they care about and refuse or neglect to publish
information readers believe important.

The congress believes that to gain more respect from the public, the ’ Q1:
media must be more accurate, understand the stories before writing
them, remember that they are dealing with people and more impor-
tantly, remember “that the First Amendment belongs to every Ameri-
can, not just journalists.”

For at least three months ofeach ofthe last three years. Tom Sullivan has been
on a tour that has taken him around the nation. In the past year and a half, he has
visited over I60 college campuses, to which he will add Pitt when he makes an
appearance here tomorrow night.

Sullivan’s audiences have ranged in size and sound from a quiet I00 to a
boisterous 6.000. His program, “lfYou Could See What l Hear.” has been called
a celebration ofthe underdog. His emphasis is on self—worth and the determina-
tion of the individual when confronted by mounting odds.

His non-stop schedule will not end here. Sullivan has been a regular corres-
pondent for ABC—TV’s “(iood Morning America" for three and a hall‘ years. as
well as an accomplished athlete. entertainer. actor. authorand musician. His TV
appearances include stints with “M*/\*S*H.““l*an1e,““Mork and Mindy“ and
“WKRP in Cincinnati."

Sullivan. 30. will soon star in a movie now in its developmental stage. He is
also working with a well-known Hollywood screenwriter to produce another
movie.

By the way, Sullivan is blind. Born three months premature and weighing only
two pounds. one ounce. he has since known only what his ea rs tell him. l*or three
and a hall decades. Sullivan‘s lite and his /est lor living have been anything but
believable.

Cl Cl C] Cl
What brings you to so many college campuses?

Sl’l.l.l\'Al\': l‘m lrighteningl_\ concerned that students are not being given
positive reinlorceincnt. l he_\ aren‘t being told they're terrilic. ll you vsould onl_\
listen to vv hat kids are sa_\ing today lhe_\‘re taking the sale roads, lhey go to
sL‘lit)t)l and go into the same thing: business or computer science. It might give
them a career rob. but hardly a lilcstyle.

What is the problem?

SULLIVAN: They have no leadership. lt‘s certainl_v political. ()n campus.
they are getting no laculty support by people who are there because it's a job to
them. We‘re in a situation where kids aren‘t sharing. Nobody is sharing. ()n
campus. everyone used to work together. where they aren't now.

But what is it that you. or anyone else for that matter, can do about it? Besides,
what is it that you have noticed that perhaps no one else is willing to do anything
about?

Sl7l.LlVAN: Twelve years ago. l was in school to get involved in things.
whether they were right or wrong. There was Vietnam. civil rights; it was a time
when we thought we were the enlightened generation. People got together and
did things. Now they get together as individuals for degrees.

CIDDD

Recently. Sullivan‘s l3—year—old daughter. Blythe. entered into a race for her
school‘s student council. The vote was never held because not enough students
ran. Sullivan said that is an example of how students have extracurricular
activity as the larthest thing from their minds. lt leads to what he calls too much
individuality later.

That is the essence of Sullivan‘s biographical lecture. “ll Y ou (‘ould See What
I Hear." a program that includes song and story and mixes rowdy humor with
turn—around philosophies.

[3 Cl Cl C]
What urged you to tackle a problem that poses such overwhelming odds?

SITLLIVAN: What started me oft‘? I work in an industry [show business] that
is apathetic‘. lhere is no love process. less than l0() people succeed in it. Its an
ass—kissing business. Theres no reality in it. You can be at a particular part_v. and
you have to be nice to somebody. lt‘s completely competition. (letting to the top
isn‘t what‘s important. You have to climb or don‘t bother. You only have one
life.

Today’s society oftentimes slaps a label on people who are handicapped. Does
the word “handicapped” annoy you?

SULLIVAN: lt interests me. In horse racing. the handicap is the better horse.
You put a saddle on the better horse. The implications are upsetting. The
problem is. you never beat the label system. To be blind that will always be the
measuring stick in how l‘m measured. What it breaks down to. in the end. is.
what choice do you have?

Your personality doesn’t fit the image of someone who is blind. At what point
did you realize that blindness could become an obstacle to any dreams or
aspirations you sought?

SULLIVAN: ln high school. in order for me to show that I wanted to share
with kids. I always had to overcome barriers. In doing that. l was always the kid
in music, sports; then I was the loudmouth involved in student government. It
was a tremendous need to be loved by everybody else. l saw my “handicap" as a
handicap. Today. there‘s still a disadvantage. but only il l make it that way.

How often do you suffer from the adverse consequences of this disadvantage?
SULLIVAN: The minute you feel rejection the minute you‘re denied

something you want to do but can‘t because you’re blind — I realized that when
kids didn’t want to play with me [when l was younger]. You never get over it. I

EICICICI

Yes, Tom Sullivan plays golf. He also enjoys skydiving, water skiing and
running in marathons. His first two years of schooling were spent at Providence
College, before he let an infatuation get the best of him and went to Harvard to
be with the girl he thought he loved.

While there. he rowed with the Crimson crew and was a member ofthe I9b8
Il.S. ()Iympic wrestling team. having earlier won a Massachusetts state high
school wrestling championship.

He has since married. Ilis wife Patty is also 30.

Sullivan has turned down suggestions that he run for a seat in (‘alifornia

ducer Aaron Spelling and read} ing for a lead role in “ The (‘ouncilotxii Sullivan
senses a void in his life.

Cl E] Cl C]
Do you think you‘ve been given any breaks in life?

Sl'I,I.IVAN: I don’t know what a break is. It is an interesting thought.
though. In some ways. blindness is a break. [People] either over- or under-
estimate your abilities. Ihe people I meet are offvbalance. When I walk into a
business meeting. people are so off for the first I5 minutes that they‘ll offer me
anything. any contract. I’att_v. she‘s the best break. A break indicates luck. and I
think all of us have luck. I he question is. what do we do with it when we get it.’
Ilow do we com ert it‘.’

When you neared graduation from college. how were you reacting to entering
the adult world as a blind person?

SIILLIVAN: At the end of school. there were no jobs open to blind people.
Society has along way to go today imagine what it was like then. The I)ark
Ages. People like us were supposed to weave baskets. I do remember talking to
the head of the psychology department. He said to get a master‘s. then a
doctorate and then teach other blind people. I said. “Forget it.“ lflife has to bea
label. then why be here‘?

Your predicament then is analagous to the time Ford was just coming out with
the Model-T.

Sl'[.I.IVAN: No. we were at the point where the wheeljust came into being.
Now the automatic transmission is coming in. ()ver 7() percent of those who are
disabled today are not working in any kind ofjob. Seventy percent ofthose who
are working are in organizations that work with disabled people.

Nowadays, you are active in so many sports. Besides the healthy aspects ofit all,
why?

SULLIVAN: I do those things because they‘re fun. Also because they‘re part
of life. and I love adventure. Also. to get people to see that I can share. I'll always
be. first. the blind person. I‘ve learned to turn disadvantage into advantage.

To what degree is human assistance a factor in your everyday life?

SIILLIVAN: We’re all interdependent. though we may not think so. Really.
20 percent of my life is dependent. The rest is me and the dog.

Has there been anything at which you haven‘t been successful?

SULLIVAN: It's very difficult for me to accept the fact that I will never host or
be the principal of my own series because the networks will never let me keynote
a show for them. They won‘t build a show’ on a blind person. And there’s another
thing. I’d like to play football forthe[NI~‘I.’s Los Angeles] Raiders and catch TI)
passes. I know the players. They really are America's Team.

EICJEIEI

It was eight years ago that Tom Sullivan was lounging beside his backyard
pool with his daughter. Blythe. Through his own negligence, he admitted. Blythe
somehow slipped into the water and would have drowned had he not saved her.

It was more than a heroic effort. Sullivan will say. as he listened to the water
bubbles formed by BIythe‘s labored breathing to locate and rescue her. He calls it
a crossroads in his life, as if he hasn’t walked precariously before.

EIDEID

What did you learn from that experience?

SULLIVAN: At the time I felt like a complete, total failure. The thingl loved
the most was the person in that pool. I guess society was right. I ean‘t do
anything; I‘m helpless. This was a turning point in that it makes you make a
commitment. I developed a balance of perspective. Before that. I thought I could
do anything. It was plain that I was concerned with my own drives and that as a
father. I wasn't a concerned parent.

And today?

SllI,I.IVAN: Iiverybody hopes to be busy. Sometimes life gets to the point
where it isn‘t your own. I’m at the point where I‘m trying to find a list of
priorities.

with the divestiture of the 22 Bell Operating companies
and the restructuring of the AT&T organization, questions
arise concerning how the change will affect AT&T Bell
Laboratories.

Will the ingenuity still be there? Will there still be the
creativity, the innovation and the unique development
capability that has made AT&T Bell Laboratories one
of the nation's foremost technological resources? Yes.
So what's new?

Pitt speeds up

for the

By Mike Siberini
The Pitt News

For the first I5 or so minutes of
yesterday‘s workout. the Pitt men‘s
basketball team worked exclusively
on getting the ball up the court as
quick as possible. Head coach Roy
Chipman said afterwards that this
was a normal exercise for his Panth-
ers and one that would be put to the
test against Providence tonight in
Rhode Island.

“We‘re definitely trying to run
more than we have been,“ he said. “I
feel like we haven‘t been getting the
easy shots. Off the running game.
hopefully we can do that.“

“lt definitely favors us to be out
on the move." added senior guard
Billy Culbertson. “Personally. I like
it because l can get free for a few
more layups. I like moving a lot; it
helps me more than being in the
slow-up.“

ln addition to his speeded—up
game plan. Chipman has also
decided on another change in stra-
tegy: insert Andre Williams into the
starting lineup in place of Chip Wat-
kins at one forward spot. This move.
like the first. is aimed at boosting the
Pitt offense.

“Chip has not been scoring. We
haven‘t got the offensive rebounds
that turn into baskets." Chipman
said. “Andre gives us more scoring
from inside." E

Williams. who is happy about his
new assignment. admits that he will
have to mentally prepare a little dif-
ferently than if he were coming off
the bench‘.

“Starting. 1 have to be more pre-
pared. When 1 come off the bcnchl

Friars

can watch the game and pick things
up as they go along.“ the 6-8 junior
said. “Now. I have to be aware of
what‘s going on from the beginning
of the game to the end ofthe game.“

And as if these problems weren‘t
enough for one team to worry about.
there is Providence‘s high-scoring
Otis Thorpe. The 6-9 center is cur-
rently third in the Big East Confer-
ence in scoring (18.9 points per
game) and first in rebounding ( l()i6
per game).

‘‘We’ll keep the pressure on him
with our post people." Chipman
said. “We‘ve done a goodjob against
other big players. Our
hasn’t been defense. Syracuse was
averaging 82 points a game. and we
held them to <52. Our problem has
been at the other end.“

“Otis is a strong inside player."
Culbertson added. “He‘s very strong
down under. We’ll try and keep the
ball away from him. We‘re going to
play everyone hard. but we‘ll keep
an eye on him."

Beyond Thorpe. Providence is not
as strong offensively as it was in

. l982—83. The void left by the grad-

uation of starters Ron Jackson and
Ricky Tucker has not been ade-
quately filled.

‘“We‘re not quite as potent as we
were last year." said Friar head
coach Joe Mullaney. “Our defense
has had to come on to keep us in a
few games. The biggest thing for us
is to get our offense going."

Pitt (ll—o overall. 2-5 in the Big
East). which has lost it‘s last two
games. is not taking the Friars (9-8
overall. I-6 in the Conference)
lightly.

“Every game in the Big East is a
tough one." Culbertson said. “We
have to win sometime alongthe way.
and now is as gopd a time as any.“

Lady Panthers
start city rivalry

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

/

In these days of geographically
diverse athletic conferences. it is rare
when one collegiate team confronts
another thatspeaksthe same dialect.

Tonight in Fitzgerald Field House
the H-8 Lady Panthers take on
cross-town cagers rival Duquesne
after a two week stint up and down
the coast--from South Carolina to
Connecticut.

The Dutchesses are coached by
Paul Hindes. who inherited the reins
from Tom Welch this season.
Hindes enjoyed a highly successful
tenure as coach ofthe Baldwin High
School’s girls‘ basketball team.

_chalking up three WPIAL cham-

pionships and an 89-28 record.

Hindes has found that the key to
victory in days gone by has not
opened up many doors this season;
he brings a 5-10 record into
Oakland.

“The level of competition in high
school was such that you could find
a team‘s weaknesses and exploit
them," said Hindes. “l think Pitt‘s a
solid team."

Pitt head coach Judy Saurer
focuses on the team behind the
record.

“They've played some really good
teams--Penn State. and Robert
Morris. to whom they gave a tough
time." she said of Duquesne. who

times I couldn't tell what they were
in. They ran multiple offenses as
well. and he plays a lot of people‘,

Guard Kim Tirik has come into
contact with at least four
Dutchesses.

“Kim Becker (freshman) is pretty
good. and Maureen Major (5-8
freshman) is a good outside
shooter." Tirik said. “Becky ()gelvee
is their point guard. and she’s pretty
quick.”

“They’re scrappy and hustlers.
and they’ll be all over us defensively.
They‘rc still pretty out of control
offensively. They try to run all kinds
of plays that don‘t really work but
they gave Robert Morris a tough
time."

Jennifer Bruce. Pitt’s leading
scorer. averaging 24.2 points per
game agrees with Tirik‘s assessment
of Duquesne.

“They‘re scrappy. and we defi-
nitely can't take them lightly.” said
Bruce. “They think Pitt's a big deal.
but they are sneaky."

Bruce does not take her game
lightly. The 6-0 junior scored 29
points in the team’s Big East win
over Connecticut this weekend. 78-
56. Bruce pulled down I2 rebounds
in the game. which gave Pitt a 3-l
conference mark. but she believes
the team could have widened the
scoring gap even further.

“We should‘ve (blown) them
away." Bruce said. Pitt trailed at
half-time. 32-30. but revived in the
second half. as is their custom. “We
took their main players out of the
game. Leigh Curl fouled out of the
game with only ten points. and she

According to Stephanie Collins.
the Dutchesses will seek to avenge
Pitt‘s hold on the local media
coverage.

“It should be tough.“ Collins said.
“Pitt gets all the publicity. so they‘re
going to want to come in here and
win."

Duquesne is led by forward Chris-
sie Stough with l 1.4 points per game

and 5-8 forward Carol Burchlaw
with 9.5 rebounds per game. Tops in
the assist department is sophomore
Becky Ogelvee with 07.

Hindes expects the contest to be
very defensive.

“We expect Pitt to play a pressure
game. very aggressive." he said.
“We'll have to play a pressure game
also.“

“Their defenses are incredible."
Saurer said. “They are aggressive
and have some very physical players.
Thcy‘ll be fired up.”

“After she [Callan] made Big East

“she started to realize what playing

“She reali/es she is here for aca-

Coach Sauer. “and she must per-

With four straight losses the
Panther wrestling team will be
trying to get back on the winning
track tonight as they travel to
Ashland, Ohio, to take on Ash-
land College and Eastern Michi-
gan, in a tri—meet.

. The struggle to gain a victory
could be even more difficult
because the Panther coaches
know little or nothing about the
opponents they are goingto face.
i Also, due to unknown circum-
stances. Eastern Michigan may
not even show up for the match.

Other than coming to the
match with a I3-I record and an
I Ith place rankingin Division II.
Ashland by and large remains a
mystery. I

“We’re going into the match
pretty much blind, because they
never do much publicity.” said
assistant coach Chuck Coryea.
“All we know is that Ashland
College is one of the better Div-
ision Il schols around."

But the lack of knowledge is
not scaring off the Panthers
attack.

‘‘It’s fine to have a good scout-
ing report. it definitely helps,“
said Coryea. “But you still have

to go out there and do the job.“

The Panthers. 3-6 overall. will
be showing a line-up spotted
with injuries that could deter-
mine the outcomes of tonight‘s
matches.

At II8 lbs.. freshman Hal
Bolin will get the call for the
Panthers. even though he has
been bothered by ajreeurring
back injury. ‘ P

~ 

“It may even help us not to
know what they have because we

Kyle Nellis will take to the
mats at I26 lbs. despite a minor
knee injury. Pitt’s John Hnath
will probably see action at I34
lbs.

At I42 lbs., senior co—captain
Joe Throckmorton will likely be
back to claim his top spot after
an illness had hampered his per-
formance the past two weeks.

Greg Dille. I50 Ibs.. will start
for the Panthers, as will Joe
Bond at I58 lbs.. and co-captain
Jeff Jelic at I67 pounds. One-
hundred and seventy-seven-
pound sophomore Kurt Joseph

.will also retain his starting spot.

The biggest question for Pitt
will be in the top weightclasses as
the regulars in the heavy weight
position. Dan Kasperkoski and
William Hinton will miss tonight

._ due to injuries.

Replacing them will be either
Jack Uppling, the regular I90
pounder or freshman Curt
Conner. Both have had expe-
rience against heavy weights. but
it is not known at this time who
will get the call to move up.

According to Coryea. the
matches will be very important
for the Panthers to get back some
of the confidence they lost in the
four stright defeats at the hands
of West Virginia. Cleveland.
Bloomsburg and Kent State.

“We need it to build up the
confidence in ourselves.”Coryea
said. “After you loseacouple in a

row youstart to feel down about I

yourself. We have to get back on
the -right track and shoe our-
selves that we are better than the
way we‘ve been performing.”

, Coleman climbing
over the obstacles

By Gabrielle Pease
For The Pitt News

Sometimes the walk to Trees Hall
can prove treacherous for small
packages like Pitt freshman gymnast
Kelli Coleman, 4-ll. Especially in
last week's snow storm. On Thurs-
day, Kelli missed the bus, was late
for practice, and had to climb up the
hill on Darragh street.

“I climbed half way up and slid
right back down,"she says. But such
challenges are minute obstacles for
Kelli. She faces them every day in
gymnastics practice.

This season coach Donna DeMa-
rino Sanft is priming Coleman for
the challenge of all-around competi-
tion, which she hopes Coleman will
be ready for by next year. “Kelli is
working on strength right now,"
Sanft says. “We’re giving her train-
ing moves." This season Kelli com-
petes in floor excercise and balance
beam events.

After Kelli has finished a floor
routine in afternoon practice, Sanft
points out the rough spots. “Watch
that twist right off the floor. That
will be a deduction,” she says to
Kelli.

Kelli moves over to the balance
beam. She presses to a handstand on
it and double pirouettes on her
hands with as much effort as one
might take to press an‘ elevator but-
ton. Kelli’s balance beam routine is
especially, important to Sanft
because Kelli istne only person on
the team whose routine, if executed
perfectly, could score a perfect ten.

The routine has three back
handsprings in it. And Sanft is confi-
dent about Kelli‘s ability to perform
well on the balance beam.“ She has a
good head for competition,” says
Sanft.

Kelli, I8, has trained at two ofthe
most prestigious gymnastic clubs in
the state. But she doesn’t dwell on
her earlier years in gymnastics. At
the Parkette Gymnastic Club in her
hometown, Allentown. PA, Kelli
competed for 4 and a half years,
until I982. She was temporarily
forced to quit gymnastics to have
knee surgery.

Once off the crutches, Kelli con-
tinued with her high school studies.
She was involved in cheerleading
and diving. She didn’t go back to
gymnastics until her senior year in
high school when she joined Berks
Academy, a gymnastic club in Read-
ing. PA. She says the disciplined
atmosphere of a gymnastic club has
taught her the necessity of hard
work.

“College gymnastics ~— it‘s like
another hard class”. Kelli added,
“You always have to be there. lt’s a
ritual. But it’s also a lot of fun.”

Between gymnastics and her
classes, Kelli finds little free time.
Especially on the days of biology
lab, Kelli’s schedule is packed. “ I get
back to my room and l‘m dead,"she
says.

Kelli’s room also houses her
hamsters, Harry and George in their
Habitrail. Harry and George help
her study for the career she plans in
occupational therapy.

The pictures of me bodybuilders
on her refrigerator are there to
remind her to do one of the things
she dislikes about gymnastic train-
ing. “l have to lift weights to get my
strength up," she says, making a
face.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February l, 1984

Also in her room. a scale sticks
out from underneath the curtain of
her closet. Although she has to buy
her clothes in the children's depart-
ment, Kelli insists that she has to
watch her weight.

“I eat good things," she says, “and
popcorn." The girls next door
bought her the hot air popcorn
‘popper on her desk as a Christmas
gift.

Kelli plans no further gymnastics
career beyond college. She is con-
centrating on entering a career based
on her academics. “A lot of people
here ask me if I want to be in the
Olympics,” Kelli laughs. “I tell them,
the Olympics are for I4 and I5 year
olds."

Even without Olympic aspira-
tions, Kelli can look forward to a
successful collegiate gymnastic
career, according to Sanft. “Not
competing for one and a half years
sets her back in her training but not 7

WHY WOULD AN MBA
' GO INTO SALES?

Because It's Smart!

  
   
  
   

The smart MBA recognizes that selling provides an ideal career start. It puts you on the "firing line" in a competitive
marketing environment. It offers an exposure to the problems and benefits of a company's product line. It's a groundﬂoor
education into overall corporate operations. And it's a fast track into management.

Many an MBA has started in sales and ended up in the boardroom. But they were smart. They chose their first employer
on the basis of industry strength and potential, of market share and product quality, and of progressive management. That's
why in I984 the smart MBA is taking a long hard look at the Diagnostics Division of Abbott Laboratories.

WHY WOULDLAN MBA
SELL DIAGNOSTICS?

Because It's Smart!

Medical diagnostic products are used internationally to identify specific illnesses and monitor the effect of therapeutic
treatments. They are changing the face of modern medicine, and are one of the fastest growing areas in the health care
products industry. By 1990 diagnosticswill grow from $4 billion to $9 billion. And a major reason for that growth can be
attributed to the sophisticated products created by Abbott Diagnostics. ‘

WHY WOULDAN MBA
SELL FOR ABBOTT?

Because It's Smart!

     
     

When you look at Abbott Diagnostics, you're looking at Number I. the undisputed world leader in medical
diagnostics. You're looking at a company that spends millions of dollars on product research and development.
A company whose advances in ﬂuorescent immunoassays and enzyme immunoassays have created a significant
demand for newer and faster products. A company with an exceptional reputation for quality, pricing and
product support. What's more, you're looking at a company in its infancy. but with extraordinary potential

    WHY WOULD AN MBA
INTERVIEW WITH ABBOTT?

Because its Very Smart!

‘ For professionals just beginning their careers. Abbott is a name worth investigating. We're experienced. aggressive.
and financially strong. But the only way to really explore this unusual career opportunity is to talk with an
Abbott representative, Si n up sheets for Abbott Diagnostics’ interviewing schedule are being posted now. Meet
with us and find out just ow promising a career in medical diagnostics can be.- If you are unable to interview,
but would like a copy of our brochure, “Peak Performance - Careers at Abbott Diagnostics," send a resume to:

Middle-distance man
Colas fights obscurity

By Charlie Oi’Hara
The Pitt News

He has probably run the oval in the Fitz-
gerald Field House more times than the bas-
ketball players have run the length of the
court, but on the University of Pittsburgh
campus. he remains virtually anonymous.
Collegiately. he ranks No. l in the nation for
the 1,000-meter run. and he has yet to receive
his due.

Senior Todd Colas has been fighting the
obscurity that plagues " middle—distance
runners at the University of Pittsburgh.

Last week, however, a break through of
sorts occurred. Colas’ performances came to
the attention of Bally lnvitational meet
director Mike Muska. Colas was awarded
an invitation to compete in the prestigious
event held at the Rosemont—Hori7.on in
Chicago.

He ‘responded to the challenge with
dogged determination. Only former Olym—
pian Mark Belger held Colas and his deter-
mination from breaking the tape.

Colas‘ time of 2:21.86 puts him at the top
of the collegiate heap, while-Belger’s mark of
2:20.97 is No. l at all levels.

“The experience in Chicago for Todd was
great." Panther coach John Vasvary said.
‘‘It‘s not just competing against the quality
runners that he faced, but its also the exper-
ience of doing well against them.

“It has to build his confidence as an indi-
vidual being invited to a meet like that.
Someone else is finally saying ‘he is a good
runner.’ “

“l don‘t blame [the meet directors]." Colas
said. “They’re out to make money, and in
order to do that, they have to bring in name
runners. I don‘t think it’s.fair. I think l‘m
deserving enough to go to these meets.”

As of Tuesday, the organizers of the
Vitalis-Olympic Invitational still don’t con-
sider him deserving and the Millrose Games,
for the second year in a row, failed to invite
him.

“We’re waiting for the invitation [from the
Vitalis-Olympic lnvitational],” Vasvary

 
 

WE’RE BACKIN THE FIGHT!!
LITTLE ITALY PIZZARIA

 

said. “Todd should be in that meet. He’s run
the second best time in the country, and it
might be the second best in the world."

Colas beat ex—national champion Bill
Martin of Club Nike in the Bally Invite.

“lt's satisfying to be known as a member
of a great relay team." Vasvary said of Pius
two-mile-relay team, of which Colas is an
integral part. “But before Todd’s finished,
l‘m sure he would like to be known as a great
middle—distance runner.”

Priorto Vasvary’s arrival at Pitt in Sep-
tember of I982, the only recognition Colas
received was through the two—mile relay.

“Coach [Vasvary] has had a lot to do with
it.” Colas said. “You can‘t go up the ladder
of competition unless you become stronger
up top,” (as he pointed in the direction ofhis
head). “He has worked hard to help me con-
ceptualize my training and racing in a whole
new way. It’s fun to run relays, but l deserve
to run in the individual races.”

Colas is a strong contender for the indoor
national championship in the l,0()O—meter
event. but the distance is not run in competi-
tion outdoors. In April, when the outdoor
season begins, Colas will gear his efforts
toward the 800—meter or l.50()—meter distan-
ces. Last spring. he missed qualifying for the
NCAA championships in the 800—meter run
by only one tenth of a second.

“It has helped from a coaching standpoint
being together for another year." Vasvary
said. “We have a very good relationship.
We‘re able to discuss what we’re going to do.
and then after it’s been done, we discuss
what we did and how to do it better next time
out.

“I really think Todd can go a lot further.l
just hope that he keeps on running after he‘s
done with school.”

Colas is considering graduate‘ school
although he wants to get ajob in the fall after
graduation. The information science major
said he has to make a decision whether he
truly wants to pursue a track career past
college.

lf untapped talent remains within Colas as
Vasvary suggests, the step from national to
world class could well be within his grasp.
