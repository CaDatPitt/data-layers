Shelters’ Target Date
Slated For December

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Two bus shelters will be erected in time for the coming winter,
Paul Hensler. president of the Commuter Association (CA), reports
that City Planning has approved the project and pads will be laid soon.

The shelters will be located on Fifth Ave. and Forbes St. respec-
tively. The target date, according to Hensler, is the second week in
December.

Hensler assessed that the shelters will provide maximum comfort
to bystanders waiting for buses. He explained the exteriors will be
made of plexiglass, which will protect people from the wind, and inter-
iors equipped with heating.

He added that he is “particularly concerned” about the Forbes St.
shelter. “The wind on Forbes St. is especially strong.” A probable solu-
tion will be the installation of baffles to combat the wind, and expansion
of the shelter.

The project was formulated last February when the CA approach-
ed United States Steel Equitable Gas, and the United Plate Glass Com-
pany. An estimate was received which totaled $15,000.

The CA requested finances. from the University, which evokeda
promise to build the shelters by fall.

“Since nobody was around to keep track of things during the sum-
mer,” Paul related, “very little materialized throughout June, July,
and August. Consequently, we didn’t discover the need for an additional
$6,000 until the new term began.”

The situationireached the point in which the CA threatened to build
a wooden shelter on the Cathedral lawn. Finally, the administration
conceded and granted the money. i

The chairmain said that the first two shelters are “experimental.”
He also revealed that shortly after these are constructed two more will
go up—one on the island between Hillman and Carnegie Libraries, and
one between Clapp Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.

At a CA meeting last Thursday, Hensler explained attempts to ob-
tain the lease for two parking lots presently rented by the University to
an Oakland citizen. The CA, with the assent of the administration, hopes
to lower the rates from $7 to $2 per month.

A committee was formed to provide that commuter mail boxes be
installed so that students could receive notifications of University

activities.

Tom Gainan, vice-president of the CA and editor of the commuter
newspaper. the Magic Bus, stated that the next issue of the newspaper
will be released around Thanksgiving. He added that writers and busi-
ness staff members are need for the Magic Bus.

Angelo Davis Called

“On A Collision Course"

by JUDY VOLLMER
Assistant News Editor

A crowd of about 250 filled the
Clapp Hall Auditorium Wednes-
day night to hear speakers work-
ing for the Angela Davis Defense
Fund.

Dr. Audrey Holland from the
University's Speech Department
kicked off the rally, claiming that
“Angela Davis is on a collision
course because of her blackness,
her party membership, and her
militancy. Before she could be
heard, she has been judged guilty.
This is part of the American so-
ciety. The hallowed tradition of
‘innocent until proven guilty’ is
not true.“ '

Dr. Holland also maintained
that as long as America remains
“racist and bigoted,” there will
be more Angela Davises. Stress-
ing the need for financial support
for Angela, Professor Holland em-
phasized, “The academic com-
munity should be pressured to
contribute through the voice of
its conscience. We must guard our

During the past week, THE
PITT NEWS has been informed by
the agency which solicits its na-
tional advertising that some of the
advertisements which have ap-
peared regarding abortion refer-
ral or information services are of
dubious reputability. THE PITT
NEWS would like to advise its
readers to proceed with the ut-
most caution in replying to any of

peared heretofore.

 

 

own community.”

“The political climate," Dr.
Holland continued, “bodes repres-
sion for those who dare and speak

out. We must save our own ability

to say no."

Commenting on political oppres-
sion in America, Rev. Gus Taylor
claimed, “We are all Angela Da-
vis. Any black man with a consci-
ousness of what is going on in this
country is constantly angry. We
realize how petty our small vio-
lence is against the system that
wreaks horror and violence upon
us.

“Many of us know that there are
tanks and armies in Pittsburgh,”
Taylor stated, “and I’ve seen Man-
chester blocked off like an island.
I’ve seen the Manchester com-
munity enveloped in the darkness
that is Pittsburgh. We are all An-
gela Davis.”

After Rev. Taylor spoke, Jan
Calloway, representing the Gener-
al Legal Defense Fund, read a let-
ter from Tim Stevens, candidate
for president of the “New Image"
NAACP in Pittsburgh. Stevens
was unable to attend the rally, be-
cause of “threats of a smear cam-
paign branding him a communist."

The final speaker was Charlene
Mitchell, 1968 Community Party
candidate for the Presidency of
the United States. Mitchell began
with greetings from Angela, now
held in the Women’s Detention
House in New York City.

“Angela sends her greetings to
all people, reminding you that
people have the right to make a

Evaluation Of Women’s

Rights Forced By HEW

by SUE HOENSTINE
The University Committee for Women’s Rights has succeeded in
forcing the administration to evaluate the status of women within the
University.

Saturday was the deadline for Pitt to submit a study concerning job O. " 

discrimination and an affirmative action program to the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) .

Equal pay for equal work, unequal working facilities for women
employees, and imaie-dominated practices of decision making in hiring,
firing, promotions, and scholarship aid are included in a list of 95 alle-

gations compiled against the University by the UCWR. A spokesman : ._
for the UCWR stated that the allegations were drawn up when HEW in-  v .-

formed the women that “the Chancellor didn’t know what we were com-
plaining about.”
UCWR COMPLAINTS
Last January, the UCWR gave the Chancellor a list of goals con-

Political Center Still Functioning

CIC Compiles Legislative

Info,

by ELLEN GANLEY

The Citizenship Information
Center helped a number of Pitt
students become involved in some
of the recent political campaigns.
Now that the elections are over,
the CIC will continue to function.
although in slightly different ways.

Jane Thompson, director of the
Center, located in 622 Social

Science Building (ext. 6705), said
that the office is presently com-

piling lists of the new U.S. Con-
gress and the new Pennsylvania
legislature. The lists will indicate
what committees the incumbent
members are on and give short
biographical sketches of new mem-
bers.

For future use, the Center is
planning to compile voting records
on all Congressmen, Senators and
members of the State Legislature,
Mrs. Thompson stated that the
Center will also be “starting a file
of organizations which are either
pressure groups or are directly
political."

Mrs. Thompson went on to say
that “hopefully, we can act as a
resource for groups who want to
know where someone stands on
various issues.”

Concerning the recent election,
Mrs. Thompson feels that it wasn't
a good campaign by which to judge
student involvement. She esti-
mated that around 300 undergrad-
uates were actively involved, but
most of these students were plug-
ged into campaigns before the
Citizenship Information Center
was begun.

In all, the Center aided around

25 students to find campaigns and

ination clauses of this contract or" 
with any of such rules, regulations, 

(Continued on Page 3)

 

some of these students, Mrs.
Thompson surmised, might not
have followed up their orginal
commitment.

Mrs. Thompson. believes that
one reason student participation
was so low was that the majority
of undergrads do not have the
right to vote. She commented that
it’s “hard to be involved in an
election when you’re not directly
involved by voting.” Mrs. Thomp-
son went on to explain that under
the new Voting Rights Act, any-
one from 18-21 years of age will
be permitted to register to vote
after Dec. 3 of 1970. If the voting .
act is declared unconstitutional. -
new registrations will be thrown 
out. In any case, Mrs. Thompson , 
stated, “the registration cards ’’
will be held back until March.”

    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     

The biggest problem that the
CIC is having at the moment is
lack of communication. Mrs.
Thompson said that she “assum-
ed that the people on campus knew
what the CIC was. The Pitt News
covered everything we did but not "
everyone on campus reads it.” »

“Our biggest problem,” /she‘,
concluded, “is letting people know"7
we’re here.” 2 . I

physically and technically. With a
light Southern dialect that seems
just right—he consistently builds
a character, delivering a beauti-
fully done portrayal that is as nat-
ural as it is believable.

His-timing is one the spot. He’s

calm when he’s supposed to be
calm, and he’s hilariously livid
with rage when the part calls for
that. In short, it is his lovesong.
Starne’s wife-a la prostitute-

but her eyes blink at the wrong

She did, however, pick up-—and
finally her character came to
bloom and she also.

Youths Learn Freely

by CINDY MORGAN

-Upon approaching the Universi-
ty and City Ministries (UACM) on
Fifth Ave.. you may see a group of
casually dressed teenagers sitting
on the steps doing algebra.

One rather long-haired boy yells
to another. “Why don't you shut
up now, man? We aren‘t going to
learn anything if you keep talk-
ing! "

These are high school students,
part of 42 enrolled in Pittsburgh's
new experimental high school, the

Youth Learning Center, which
opened last September. ‘
The alternative school is de-

signed not only to free students
from the rigid structures often
found in many public and private
schools, but also to offer each stu-
dent more personalized attention
and a chance to learn in real-life
situations.

In addition. the students are en-
couraged to apprentice them-

selves for a period of time under

someone working in the field of
their particular interests.

This method is considered in-
tegral to the school's experience-
based education as a student
moves closer to identifying his vo-
cational interest.

Center students are given a
free-hand in choosing their curri-
culum and they are responsible
for getting volunteers in their
specific fields of interest. Many
of these volunteers are house-
wives, college students, and even
faculty members of the Universi-
ties of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-
Mellon.

Presently, there are three em-
ployed teachers who teach speci-
fic subjects, counsel, and arrange
co-operative programs with other
cityorganizations.

Besides the traditional subjects
of algebra and English, these stu-
dents have outlined other areas of
study such as yoga. karate, crea-
tive writing. theology, multi-me-
dial communication, andthe sci-
ence of the occult.

There is much friendly interac-
tion between the student and teach-
er at the Center. No one has for-
gotten that the reason he is there
is to learn, but unlike typical high

schools, there seems to be little
formality in the teacher-student
relationship. There is always oc-
casion for friendly joking.

Not only is there freedom in
these areas, but classes are sched-
uled in much the same way as is
done on a college campus. The stu-
dent is encouraged toymanage his
own time and to seek a specific
direction in his education. ' 3

Gloria Carpenter, a student
from Homewood says the school
is “something I have always dream-
ed of! g

“This is really a good way to
adjust to other kinds of people,
both rich and poor. I know some
of the ‘kids here have parents
who are doctors and lawyers who
probably use words that are six-
syllables long. I am really able to
learn a lot more because I have
exposure to people that I would
not have the chance to meet when
I was at my old high school” ‘I

William Scott, a sophomore
Oakland, added, “If you want to
learn, you learn. If you don't well,
you don’t. Here, if you don’t feel
like coming, you don't mess it up
for the other kids. We have very
small classes, too, and it is almost
like having a private tutor."

Everything at the independent
high school is not “free." how- if 
ever. Minimum standards estab-
lished by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania will be met as re-
quired so that the students can be
granted diplomas.

Tuition, which this year is $1-
300, in part by the number of stu-
dents enrolled and in part by UA-
CM’s ability to raise financial
scholarships on short notice. A
third of the students are currently
on scholarship.

UWCR's statistics show that
only four per cent of Pitt's full
professors are women and they
claim that “women faculty spend
more years than men at a given
rank before promotion.” As far
as women staff members are con-
cerned. the UCWR has accused
the Personnel Department with
channeling women into “the lower
paying, lower status (secretarial
nd 1ow—level administrative) posi-
.ons.“

Also included in UCWR’s tes-
timony against the University is
the allegation that “the universi-
ty has harrassed women since the

‘ Labor Department of the Federal

Government with implied threats
of firing and increasing work loads

On May 29, 1970, the Chancellor
set up four study groups to inves-
tigate the following four areas: 1)
Educational Programs for Wom-
en: 2) Career Opportunities and
Services for Women Faculty: 3)
Career Opportunities for Non-
Faculty Women: and 4) Admis-
sions, Counselling and Special
Services for Women. Provost
Charles Peake, Vice-Chancellor
Francis S. Cheever, Vice-Chancel-
lor Bernard Kobosky, and Vice-
Chancellor Edison Montgomery
are heading the study groups.

The Advisory Council of Wom-
en's Opportunities was establish-
ed by the Chancellor on July 21,
1970. Mrs. Elizabeth Scott out-
lined ,ACWO's functions as advis-
ing, consulting, and reviewing
findings of the Chancellor's study
groups.

“At first we didn't know how the
study officers were getting their
information. Now reports are
coming in and we are receiving in-

- sight into where the administration

is," Mrs. Scott stated. She added
that preliminary reports concern-
ing women's opportunities are
completed and that another report
is due in January.

Mrs. Scott did not comment on
the present HEW controversy.
Concerning the study groups, Mrs.
Scott did assert, “Once the study
is completed. I don’t think that the
University has a choice other than
to rectify some of the situations
that exist.“

"Standards of Conduct” Questioned A

Handbook Printing He ld;i 

by LORETTA HORRELL

A controversial section of the
new student handbook may not be
published. The Student Affairs‘ Ad-
visory Committee (SAAC), con-
sisting of several student organ-
ization leaders, met with Dean
Charles Montgomery Thursday to
discuss “Standards of Conduct,"
the last chapter of the five-chap-
ter student handbook.

The committee was organized
to review the handb0ok‘s section
on student conduct. Its recom-
mendations will be given to Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky, who will de-
cide whether the “Standards of
Conduct" with its present wording
will appear in the handbook.

Criticism concerning the origin

strued as an official organ of the University. lts contents do no reflect policies of the Board of Trustees, the
administration or the faculty, but only those of its student writers. It is published three times weekly from

 

September to April excluding official school holidays and twice weekly May and June and once weekly in
July. Offices are located in the Schenley Ha|l—Student Union Buildings, rooms 407-417. Subscriptions

By all accounts, student involvement in election
campaigns during the past two months was sparse.
, At the University, best estimates indicate that
1. no more than a couple hundred students partici-
pated in the electoral process. This was despite a
two day Election Recess.

Elsewhere, student politicking, where it occur-
red, was on a similar scale. Even at Princeton,
where the drive for election recesses began last

» May, 75 per cent of the student body didn’t get in-
volved.

    

The roots of student apathy are diverse; they
range from selfishness to groping for alternatives
to despair.

~ Among those who deny that selfishness explains‘
their apathy, a popular refrain is “The system’s
hopeless” or “Politicians are all alike and unwor-
thy of my support.”

The Pitt News is unable to condemn the disaf-
fection with political norms prevalent in Pennsyl-
vania and the United States, especially in the light
, of recent developments.

1 Late last week, Governor-elect Milton Shapp, a

Democrat, asked Republican Governor Raymond
Shafer to call a special session of the State Legis-
lature, to solve the state’s fiscal problems before
January.

Governor Shafer rejected Shapp’s appeal for
. reasons which seem to vindicate the pessimists.

” - Unfortunately, Shafer’s motives were no loftier
than those of a Republican playing partisan politics.

It is expected that the State Legislature will
eventually pass an income tax, to eliminate the bud-
get deficit of about $450 million which will accrue
“ by the end of fiscal year 1970-71 late next June.

If the tax is enacted this year, Governor Shafer

will be responsible for it and the outgoing Republi-
, can administration will find itself saddled with
3.’ I blame.
' If, on the other hand, the state’s money problems
aren’t settled until next year, Milton Shapp and the
new Democratic Legislature will probably incur the
wrath of Pennsylvania's taxpayers.

Had Governor Shafer agreed to Shapp’s request,
it would have been an act of heroism. Only a man
who places Pennsylvania's welfare above the status
of his party could have acceded to Shapp.

It appeared months ago that Shafer may have
been a man of courage. He crossed the state cam-

 

Relevant "activity for Pitt students, especially
. for Black students began today when the first an-
 nual Black Week was initiated. Members of the BAS
have said all facets of Black Week are open to the
entire University community.

Black Week should not be mistaken as just a
Black social alternative to the usual White-appeal-
ing Homecoming or Winter Weekend events. It is an
attempt by Black University of Pittsburgh students
to bring to the total campus community that which
is meaningful and of top relevance in Black lives.

This point is obviously exemplified in the various
activities scheduled for the week which show Pitt’s
Black students do not consider the word, relevancy,
simply a concept.

- Events like the African Seminar this afternoon,
in which Pitt's African students expressed their
views on the Black movement in the U.S., clearly
 i’ show a sincere attempt in sincerity, and the quest
for knowledge——the bases for the enti.re week.

Pitt News staffers receive monetary remunera-
tion for the work which they put in on the paper. We
are the only student organization on campus which
receives this, and if it weren't for the token sum
we receive, we believe that the paper, the Universi-
ty as a whole, and each one of you would suffer a

 great loss.

The Editorial Board of the Pitt News requested
a sum of money from the Student Allocations Com-
mittee of Student Government for a sum of approxi-
mately $11,000 to be awarded to the nearly 70 mem-

. bers of the entire staff.

Research was done into already existing college
newspaper remuneration systems across the coun-
try by Mrs. Ester Kitzes, director of all Student
Publications, and the Board, to establish a prece-
dent for our request, and staffers engaged in cons-
tant meetings to convince the then dubious Alloca-
tions Committee that Pitt News physical, mental,
‘ and time demands on its personnel necessitated
some sort of monetary help in order to work on the
 paper.

1 Finally after much discussion, the Student Gov-
  , ernment Senate of the University in a regular meet-
‘ing this September almost unanimously voted to
give the Pitt News the sum we were asking. They
. I also voted to tack on a 50 cents publications fee to

paigning for a personal income tax, despite the un-
popularity of his position. .

Today, however, the lame duck governor has al-
lowed partisanship to override statemanship and he
must be judged accordingly.

His decision probably surprised few students.
For many, cynicism preceded apathy. And for most,
skepticism is not new.

In the fact of the Governor’s behavior, it is
tempting to allow those students who refused to play
the political game to say, “We told you so."

But the state’s financial problems will not be
alleviated by apathy.

It is essential that the State‘ Legislature meet
next month to solve Pennsylvania's fiscal mess be-
fore the New Year.

As House Speaker Herbert Fineman has pointed
out, if an income tax is approved in December, the
tax rate may be three times less than one approv-
ed in 1971.

This is because retroactive taxes are permissi-
ble if passed during the year to which they apply,
while they are constitutionally prohibited when they
referto a previous year.

There is still time for Governor Shafer to re-
verse his decision. As a matter of fact, he has indi-
cated that he will maintain an open mind on the
subject.

Perhaps Shafer‘s sense of public duty has been
dulled by party pressures. Perhaps he cannot be
convinced that a special session of the Legislature
should be called.

“How we live is so far removed from how we
ought to live," Machiavelli argued, “that he who
abandons what is done for what ought to be done,
will rather bring about his own runs than his preser-
vation." I

Maybe Governor Shafer agrees. But from past
actions he has demonstrated that he may opt for
principle, if only given a nudge.

With this in mind, The Pitt News urges all stu-
dents to contact Governor Shafer and advise him
to place Pennsylvania’s and the University's inter-
ests above those of the state's Republican Party.

Student apathy may be called for, but it will ac-
complish nothing. And are those who don’t protest
expediency much less guilty than those who practice
it‘?

Responsive conduct is not likely to come from
politicians, unless it is demanded of them.

Relevance

The week focuses on involvement with the com-
munities which surround and are effected by the
University. Black students here are seeking to era-
dicate the conception that they are “different” from
the brothers and sisters who live in the Hill Dis-
trict and Lower Oakland, especially.

 

Thus events are scheduled such as “Drug Abuse
in the Black Community,” dealing with a problem
which for so long has been evident in the ghetto. But
the problem only became a national one when it hit
suburbia and white youth.

The BAS has also scheduled Black community
representatives to relate some of the problems of

‘ their different areas in another community seminar.

This week. if all goes according to ,Ian, should
establish itself as one of the most important and
pertinent programs in the University relations to
the entire community.

—D.M.

And that's the story.

But not many people understand why we needed
monetary help so badkly. Pitt News involvement is
different from any other organizational or extra-
curricular activity on this campus.

An average reporter on the Pitt News staff puts
in at least 10-15 hours per week. That reporter will
receive an average of (according to last months
payments) 20 a month, or 40 cents a week.

The eight members of the Editorial Board put in
sometimes as much as 30-40 hours a week in the Pitt
News office, or as much as 150 hours a month, yet
the average gift was $80 in that department. (Around
55 cents an hour.)

We needed remuneration because many editors
and certain staffers dedicated to the paper would
have had to quit, or slow down their participation,
in order to take part—time jobs so that they could
make ends meet.

A person has to be a full time student to work on
the Pitt News, but the demands that the paper makes
on its personnel are, many times, greater than if
we were working in full time salaried jobs.

Student Government, in giving us remuneration,
felt as we have long contended, that in all areas, the
Pitt News is a special organizational case, and that
a token sum of money was indeed necessary to re-
tain its quality and dedicated workers.

  
  
 

  

 

    
  

    
 

 

  

 

       

‘Playing The Dozens’
Black Kids’ Game

by DON MARBURY
Editor

We had a little game we used to play when we were younger,

called “capping" or more commonly “playing the dozens.”

You could be a participant if you possessed one disability, pov-
erty. So it is not surprising that black children were the most fre-
quent participants in the game.

“Hey man, I went down your house the other day,” John started

off, “and the roaches was walking around with picket signs, talkin’ -

’bout, ‘Unfair we want the radio in our room.” A
“Oh yet," his verbal victim snapped, “well I done heard thiat

your daddy works on a garbage truck, for a dollar a day and all hi-{ye

can eat."

We‘d all be doubled over with laughter, including the two op-
ponents, when someone else would blurt out, “Ooh, man, you gonna
let him talk about you like that? He really burn’t you.”

To be burn’t was the height of defeat, and we knew that if John
didn’t come back with a really strong “cap’-,’ he wouldn’t be able to
hold up his head for awhile.

“Oh yeh,“ he shouted, “well I heard you done had them shoes
on so long that youd could step on a dime and know whether it’s
heads or tails.”

The laughter which John expected after his comment didn’t
come. He was faced with dead silence, because everyone had heard
that cap before. He would have to do better.

“And besides that,” he continued, “when I stayed over your
house the other night, I went down to see what y’all had in the re-
frigerator, and a rat lifted up the butter compartment—-took out a
piece of cheese—cut me a slice—and then had the nerve to apologize
for not having any fresh bread to go with it.”

That did it. We were all half-suffocating with laugher, and now
Sammy faced the disgrace of “being burn’t.” ’

“Hey John,” he said with a mischievous grin on his face, “some
of the guys done started calling your house ‘The Beach,’ know why?"

John gave an aloof, “No, why?” “Because the ants got sand
dunes all over the living room floor, and when it rains, man . . . y’all
even gots to put up umbrellas in the basement, and ya got a three-
story house."

Things were getting heated. We had laughed eqully hard at all
the caps, but it was getting near dinner time. So it was sort of silent-
ly resolved that both of them would give one more cap, since every-
one wanted to know who would be the winner.

Sammy quickly let fly with his remark. “Hey John, they tell me
that when the garbage men came tp pick up the rubbish the other
day, they made a mistake and tool your house instead of the cans:
talkin' ‘bout, they wish people would learn to keep their rubbish cans
neater."

Things looked bad for John. He thought for a long while; a quiet
look of desperation implanted on his face, when suddenly it broke
into a wide grin. “I heard,” he slowly drawled, “that your Daddy can
cook surplus meat 50 different ways.”

We all started to laught, then we looked at Sammy’s face. He
wasn’t laughing. John had broken the rules. He had something too
close to being true. .

And then I realized that all the things they had been saying about
each other. were true. The way they said them and the atmosphere
made them funny, but the objects which were used in each cap; the
rats, roaches, poor clothing, not enough food, inadequate housing-—
they all were true of each and every one of us.

And you’ve been laughing, just like we laughed back then. Two
little black kids just told you what it means to live in the getto—and
you laughed.

Maybe even that isn't so bad, but the frightening thing is that
little black kids are still “capping” on each other, and we are still
.laughing.

 

ed Tradition

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

 

W , 

Buckley, Senator-elect from New York, the case against male con-
scription is still viewed as an exercise in treason by the so-called “si-
lent majority" and its harpies in Washington.

Draft resistance, however, is an old “American tradition.“

The first historical instance of conscientious objection occur-
red on the eve of the Revolutionary War in 1774. A band of eight-Shakers,
a celibate religious group founded by British emigre Ann Lee, re.
fused to aid the colonies for “religious reasons.”

All received four year jail sentences on various counts of trea-
son without the formaility of a trial or hearing.

During World War II, according to The Book of First Facts,
edited by Joseph Nathan Kane, 26 CO's were incarcerated in the
first concentration camp established specifically for that purpose in
1941. They were considered as “dangerous” to the security of the
country.

Undisclosed numbers of Korean war resisters have made new
comes in Canada. I

In all cases, the objectors were charged with treason.

In a nation torn at its roots by intellectual and political strife,
the question of conscription has emerged as a “safe" topic. The
Young Americans for Freedom, in a pamphlet published in 1968,
labelled the draft,  deprivation of civil liberties exceeded perhaps
only_by criminal incarceration."

Super-hawk Barry Goldwater felt in ’67 that “it would be
wrong to assume that free men have to be forced to fight for their
country.”

The continuation of a system that compels “free men” to par-
ticipate in a ‘conflict that they cannot morally justify is the height
of totalitarianism. It is the logical tentacles, however, of an unre-
responsive political structure that has propagandized its citizens

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is disgusting to watch the
University of Pittsburgh conduct
itself like a blundering Tyrannos-
aurus Rex nonchalantly crushing
those weaker than itself when they

- get in its way. The University of

Pittsburgh has been frightfully
callous regarding those who would
be hurt by the construction of the
proposed hillside dorm complex.
Thehillside dorms would exacer-
bate an already serious parking
problem in the area.

The hillside dorms would create
“people pollution" by cramming
the area with too many people.
The hillside dorms would destroy
the Falk School playground, forc-
ing the children to either give up
playing or play in the traffic-fill-
ed street.

In planning the hillside dorm
complex. the University of Pitts-
burgh has been extremely secre-
tive and has made no attempt to
consult with or even inform the
people who will be hurt. That the
dorms are to be built was acciden-
tally discovered by the commun-
ity around the Falk School when
some construction workers began
drilling for soil samples.

A university should always con-
duct-itself in such a way that it
does not intrude upon the rights
of people. When a university dis-
regards the rights of people who
are poor and too weak to defend
themselves. it makes mockery of
its function of transmitting appre-
ciation and respect for human
values.

Sincerely.

Police ‘Trial’
In Boston

(Editor’s Note( The Sept. 24
editions of the Boston newspapers

' gave banner headlines to Police

Commissioner McNamara state-
ments that the then recent bank
robbery and the killing of a city
patrolman were committed by a
“revolutionary student group.” In
response to what they term “un-
fair charges,” eight professors
from Boston area schools for-
warded a letter to The Pitt News.
The co—signers included John Dan-
giger, associate professor gf as-
tronomy at Harvard; Jerome Lett-
win, professor in biology and elec-
trical engineering at MIT; Hen-
ry Putnam, professor of philoso-
phy at Harvard; William H. Pin-
son, Jr., professor of earth and
planetary sciences at MIT; George
Salzman, professor of physics,
University of Massachusetts;
Bertram Schwary, professor of
psychology at Northeastern Uni-
versity; Marx W. Wartalsky, chair-
man, department of philosophy,
Boston University, and Philip Mor-
rison, professor of physics, MIT.)
The Editor. The Pitt News:

By continuing. day after day.
to fan the idea that radical and
even liberal college students are
involved in terrorism. the press
and the police are acting to gen-
erate a climate of fear to try to
discredit the student

movement

 

in the eyes of the rest of the
American people and to divert at-
tention from growing problems at
home. '

In the Boston area, there have
been student anti-war actions. e.g.
against ROTC and war research
at various universities, demon-
strations against racist hiring
practices. firings, and murders,
and militantly pro—working ac-
tions. e.g. refusal to allow GE re-
cruiters on campuses during the
strike.

But throughout, the radical stu-
dent movement has come out over-
whelmingly against terrorist tac-
tics.

Nothing has been proved so far
against the people who are re-
ceiving a “trial by press," Iand
contrary to the allegations made
by Commissioner McNamara,
none of the three ex—convicts on
whose testimony all the stories,
are based has any revolutionary
background.

Bond. for example. who claims
revolutionary leadership, was
thrown out of SDS meetings at
Brandeis by students who be-
lieved he was a police agent. be-
cause of the inconsistency of his
racist and pro-war views with his
posing as a revolutionary instiga-
tor.

In several of the handful of
cases in which small groups of
people have been arrested with
dynamite. the leader of the group
has turned out to be policeman.

bought the dynamite and organ-

A notorious case, reported re-
cently in The New York Times,
was that of “Tommy-the-Trav-

ed as an “SDS regional traveler,"

It is plausible that the present

With four minutes remaining in
half of the Panther
46-14 loss to Notre Dame Satur-
day in South Bend, Ind., Pitt coach
Carl DePasqua was one of the few

. coaches-—maybe the only one this

year—who felt his team could
‘beat the Irish after that much of

-‘the game had been played.

S ‘Undefeated and second—ranked
in the nation. Notre Dame took a
13-0 lead into mid-second quarter.

, P But_ the Panthers. under the guid-

ance of quarterback John Hogan

this time, fired back with two
touchdowns in less than two min-
~ 'utes to take the lead, 14-13.

It was only the second time any-

” I one had been ahead of the Irish
 this fall, and the 14 points equaled
the most scored on Notre Dame.

;So, naturally, DePasqua thought
_his team had a chance to produce
an upset.

“Yes, really, I did," he reveal-

' ed after the game as reporters

gathered in his two-by-four dress-

* ing quarters at Notre Dame Sta-

dium where conditions were as

- snug as that one-point lead. “But

any time you play a team like this,
you never known when they'll
‘ break away."

When the Irish broke away
Saturday wasn‘t long after the
Panthers had pulled ahead.

you defend against the
best passing combination in the
‘country? You give a guy a new
. jersey, that's how.
Well, not really. But that’s what
‘a lot of onlookers might have

- ‘thought Pitt grid coach Carl De-

Pasqua had in mind Saturday
against Notre Dame and its top
aerial play, Joe Theismann to Tom
,Gatewood.
' DePasqua placed a cornerback

. '-I . I wearing jersey number 23 into a

one-on-one confrontation against
Gatewood, the nation's leading col-
‘ legiate receiver. Number 23 did-
n’t sound like a number any Pitt de-
fender had been wearing this fall,

’ though.

Where did the Panther coach
find this guy?
' The guy was Bryant Salter, the

_ - gridder DePasqua had designated
.. as challenger to Gatewood during

‘interviews earlier in the week-—
only Salter was wearing the new
number. His usual number 20 jer-

jsey was torn last week at Syra-

cuse and there wasn’t an extra
’ one at hand.
Salter worried more about the

3 number 44 on a Notre Dame uni-

form which he had to key on dur-

 ing the Panther-ND game. Num-

ber 44 was quite a worry since it

1 belongs to Gatewood.

‘The Notre Dame end proved

‘ why he is at the top of the receiv-

-ing list by catching nine of 13 pass-
.es Theismann was to complete in
' thegame. He gained 116 yards
against a Pitt defender who was
.determined to confine his threat.

 _After the‘ game, Salter said he V
‘ felt he did what he_w_ante_d to do.. =

With three—and-one-half minutes
still left in the first half, Irish
quarterback Joe Theismann fired
his first of three_touchdown pass-
es. Denny Allan grabbed the long
pass after it had deflected off Pan-
ther safety Bill Ramos and had
drifted beyond another Panther,
Bryant Salter. Allan was free for
the conclusion of a 54-yard touch-
down play.

Two plays later Pitt fullback
Tony Esposito, who gained 91
yards and scored the earlier go-
ahead TD, fumbled the ball over
to the Irish. Two more plays later
and Theismann connected on a 35
yard TD pass to Ed Gulyas who
had wandered into the clear he-
hind the Pitt secondary.

The Irish were ahead, 15-14, af-
ter missing two-point conversion
attempts.

DePasqua called the fumble and
the quick strike the turning points
in the game, as Notre Dame went

on to score three more six—point—
ers in the second half.

“You have to play a damn near
perfect game to beat this team,"
the Pitt coach decided after the
game.

The near perfect game is prob-
ably necessary against Notre
Dame because they have a man

‘ who gains more yardage for his

team than anyone in the club's
famed history.

ND quarterback Theismann
made that official Saturday when
he gained 381 yards for the Irish
via the pass and the run. He sur-

passed the legendary George
Gipp‘s career total performance
mark and current Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback
Terry Hanratty's carrer total of-
fense record. He's advanced 4,-
741 yards in his college games.

Pitt's defense appeared to be
capable of stopping Notre Dame's
powerful offense five Irish
drives were halted in Panther ter-
ritory — but Theismann was al-
ways present to either run for the
big gain (he ran for 97 yards) or
throw the big pass.

“He's a threat all the way," De-
Pasqua said of the Irish star. “I'd
say he's the most well-rounded
quarterback we've seen all year."

Bryan Salter (23) sticks to his man, Tom Gatewood (44).

a lot of passes, but he’s so good
that you expect him to catch some.
I wanted to make him stay away
from the touchdown.”

Salter indeed succeeded in that
mission. Gatewood, Notre Dame's
top scorer with seven TDs, didn’t
socre Saturday and his longest
gain of the day was 21 yards,
which sounds like a long advance
but was short compared to the
jaunts made by players who
caught the few passes Gatewood
didn’t.

Three of the other aerials were
caught for touchdowns of 78 yards,
54 yards and 35 yards. Mike Crean-

" ey .hauled in the longest, and Den-
ny Allan and Ed Gulyas grabbed
the other two scoring flings from

igquartehrback Theismann. ‘

‘ good,,“‘ too;

 

think that the nation's best receiv-
er wasn‘t as good as the record
shows, however.

“Everything they say about him
is true,” Salter said after watch-
ing Gatewood as closely as any-
one has all season. “He has good
moves, quick cuts.”

Salter wasn't watching Theis-
man closely since he was busy
enough tailing Gatewood. But not
looking at Notre Dame's Heis-
man Award candidate wasn‘t the
reason Salter gave for refusing to
talk about the quarterback who
keeps getting the ball to the guy
who catches the most passes.

“I wouldn't like to comment‘ on
Theismann,’,’h Salter said, . “be-

-cause I couldn't say, enough. He's "

Ara Parseghian. Theismann‘s
coach. prised the signal caller
even more.

“He is a complete football play-
er-he runs, he passes, he leads
the team, he calls plays, he is a
real coach on the field," Parseg-
hian said.

Parseghian has more reason
than Saturday's game for praising
Theismann. The quarterback has
only three regular season games
remaining with the Irish and has
20 starts behind him, with Notre
Dame winning 17 of them, tying
two and losing only one.

Notre Dame, now 7-0, appears
ready to accept a bowl bid. which
should be offered at the season's
end.

The Panthers are 5-3 after los-
ing two consecutive games, and
only two games remain on the
schedule—aginst eastern schools,
Boston College and Penn State.

   

hance Against Irish

JOE THEISMANN
Breaks Irish Records

Runners Grab
Six Top Spots
At Penn State .

by MARTY HELLMAN

The first “Big Four“ cross-
country race between eastern in-
dependents. Pitt, Penn State, West
Virginia and Syracuse, on Satur-
day afternoon at Penn State turn-
ed out to be more of a one team
contest.

By taking six places in the top
ten, the Pitt harriers compiled an
extremely low team total of 24
points to place first.

Penn State finished second with
a team score of 49, while WVU
and Syracuse trailed with 70 and
102 points, respectively.

Pitt's Jerry Richey battled Greg
Fredericks of State for top indi-
vidual honors, and finished ap-
proximately 50 yards ahead of
him with a time of 24:58 over the
five mile course. Richey’s time
was only nine seconds off Villa-
nova’s Marty Liquori’s record.

Pitt coach Jim Banner realized
before the race that “Jerry could-

n't let Fredericks have a big lead
at the beginning." According to
teammate Mike Schurko who fin-
ished sixth, “The two of them
were in front together, but Jerry
pulled away at the end.”

However, Schurko felt that the
hero of the day was Dave Szabat,
who placed third. “At about the
two-mile mark, Dave was scream-
ing that ‘we’re going to win‘ as‘
we were running. Not only did ii.
run a tremendous race, but he
gaveus allalift."

Banner complimented Szabat
by saying, “He’s a very fine run-
ner, and I think he’ll imporve into
one of the great runners in the
country in the next couple of
years.”

Bruce Fisher was the only Syra-
cuse runner in the top ten as he
came in fourth. Jim Allahand of
the Nittany Lions and Mike Moss-
er of the Mountaineers were the
only other non-Pitt runners in the
first ten spots.

Mark Vornhagen wound up fifth,
a few steps ahead of Schurko_.

Dave Cheseborough finished nintn. ’

for Pitt, while Greg Rodgers com-
pleted the scoring for the harriers,
finishing tenth.

Banner was quite pleased with
the outcome. “The boys put on a
tremendous show,” he said. “It
was a real display of our power.”

“I think that Penn State has a
better team than they were in the
race,“ he continued, “and I
thought that West Virginia would
do a little better than they did.”

This was the last competition
for the harriers before next week's
IC4A championship meet in New
York.

Banner intends to change the
practice routine a bit in this last
week before the important east-
ern title race.

“We‘ll have to go day-by-day as

far as practice is concerned be‘-J-

cause of the weather," he ‘ex-
plained. “However, we’ll cut down

Pitts freshman football team
attempted to "put the icing on the
cake" over the Penn State frosh
with a last minute field goal on
Friday afternoon. but it turned out
to be their demise.

Lea(ling 20-13 with only 23 sec-
on(ls to go in the game. Cub Coach
Bill Quinter elected to go for a
field goal from the Lion 26-yard-
line. instead of attempting to go
for a first down or giving the ball
up with less than 20 seconds.

A swarm of white-shirted State
linemen. led by linebacker Joe
Carlozo converged on placckick-
er Eric Knisely and blocked the
kick. “Luckily for us." said Nit-
tany coach John Chuckran. “Gary
Hager. a boy with speed picked
it up."

Hager gathered in the loose ball
at his 30 and raced down the side-

".)-lint- for a touchdown. State quar-

terback Steve Joachim, who had
been superb all afternoon, hit
tight end Randy Crowder in the
end zone for the two point conver-
sion with only five seconds left to
pull the game out for the Lions.

The last minute disaster wiped
out an almost certain win for the
Cubs. who had earned a lead over
a tough PSI} squad.

At the start of the second quar-
ter. the Cubs received a break.
Trailing 7-0, they forced the Lion
punter to make a bad kick deep in
PSI’ territor_v. They recovered on
the 15-yard-line.

Tom Donchez of State had scored

In the third quarter. the Cubs
marched 46 yards on the ground
before Knisely put them into the
lead with a 30-yai'd boot._

Shortly before the fateful last
minute. Bill linglert intercepted
a Joahim pass and raced 32 yards
down the sideline with what ap-
peared to be the winning TD.

At halftime goalie Kerry Kruase
comented on the match as he stood
relazed among his sweating. pant-
ing teammates.

“I wish they were all like this,"
he said. "I haven't had to do any-
thing. It's a great feeling to have
a defense like that."

Four of the.si\' shots were stop-
ped by Krause. Fullbacks Mike
Pint-as and Jerry Kruth were each
credited with a save.

The offense fired 16 times at
the opponents goal. but were un-
able to score more than once.

Bemis attributed the lack of
scoring success to the quality of
the opponent's squad.

“We should have had a few more
goals." Bemis said, “but anytime
we can win that's all that counts."

mam STUDENTS

On Wednesday, November I8, the discussion at our "OPEN HOUSE" will focus on responsibility.
This is the second of these ads in the Pitt News which concentrates on that subject. The first ad
dealt with the Responsibility of the School of General Studies to the Community in General and
to its students in particular. This ad deals with the Responsibility of the University of Pittsburgh
t-o the School of General Studies and to us, its students.

There is an old adage which suggests that money cannot buy a good education. We disagree;
we think it can. In fact, we feel that it is incumbent on the University to offer economic solu-
tions to the myriad of problems which the School of Genera-l Studies faces.

We see at least two possible solutions. The one which we most heartily endorse is: A Seperate
Institutional Budget for the School. Under such a system, the School would permit and hire its
own full-time faculty. These faculty members would be the best equipped and most willing
to work with evening adult students. Consider for a minute, fellow students, what it would be
like to attend classes t-aught by men and women familiar with the inherent strengths and
weaknesses of night students.

An alternate solution would be a mandated share of existing School and Department Institu-
tional Budgets. Under this method, each School or Department which offers classes in the School
of General Studies would be required to allocate a specified portion of its budget to us. This
allocation is now done on a voluntary basis and the results speak for themselves.

When -one considers the methods of financing the excellent evening programs across the
country, it seems to us that one of the two proposed solutions must be implemented here in
order to achieve excellence. We are; however, painfully -aware of the acute shortage of funds.
For this reason we ‘must be patient. Yet, the Divine Line between Perpetual Patience and Indif-
ference is a fine one; and we must NOT be indifferent. We implcre the University to begin to
«look for economic solutions NOW. If that is impossible, we should seriously advocate tuition
reduction for General Studies Students.

There are other areas in which the University could direct its immediate attention. Four year
undergraduate programs in Social Work, Public Affairs, and Public Health should be devel-
oped as rapidly as possible. These programs could provide opportunity for many disadvan-
taged members of the community to seek careers in these fields while they continue to work.
In addition, the dividends would multiply as these trained people would return to the commu-
nity to work in those areas where the most pressing social problems exist.

Finally, we feel that the University has the Responsibility to provide the School of General Stu-. ,
dies and its Students with a Dean who is both a man of vision and a man of action. A man who
has the strength to say NO and the compassion to say YES. As students, we must place our trust
in the University to carry out this responsibility.

Watch for our next ad when we will discuss Stuudent Responsibility and please plan to attend
our ”OPEN HOUSE.” That's November I8, between 7 and II:3O P.M. in the Supper Room of the .
Student Union. Responsibility, the ”Four Petitions,” and tuition reduction will all be discussed
along with any issues which YOU might like to raise. See you then.
