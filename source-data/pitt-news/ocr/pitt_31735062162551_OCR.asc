“If it were a question of ﬁ-

Service Handled
5,000 Students

According to Alice Appel Poole,
supervisor of the student employ-
menut service, almost 5,000 stu-
dents were\handled by her de—.
partment during the period from‘
July 1, 1958, to. June 30, 1959.

By‘ “students handled,” Mrs.
Poole explained she means that a
student was interviewed and re-
ferred to a job opening. When
jobs were not permanent, the
same student may have been
“handled” more ‘.than once.

The School of Liberal Arts had
the most students handled by the
Student Employment service. That
total was 2,523. Next was En-
gineering and Mines with 1,144.
The others that made up the tota
of 4,941 follow: ' —

 GT0 Literary Jllinds

-— By INA AMDUR
Most students know that on the sixth ﬂoor of the univer-
sity there is a Liberal Arts reserve room and an Education
Reserve Room. However, not enough students take advantage
of another library located on the sixth ﬂoor of equal value,

the Alldred Room.

This library was endowed by the late Peter Alldred, and
it is through his generosity that?

all books are purchased for this
library. The Alldred Room spec-
ializes in books which have been

"published since 1956 in the ﬁelds

of fiction, biography, and factual
writings of various types.

I There are older books in the
library which belong to sets such
as those of the Heritage Club.
The‘ main advantage to the stu-
dent who uses the Alldred Room

is that current books can always .

be found there. Usually books
lending- libraries. For instance,
while —the_Boris Pasternak story
was being so vehemently discuss-
ed Dr. Zhivago was available in

Spring Festival Solution

The future of Spring Festival is an interesting and im-
portant question at this time. Tonight Student Government

_ Assn. is holding an open meeting at which this topic will
be discussed. .

A SGA has requested that representatives of all groups
interested in Festival attend the meeting. It IS open also

to any individuals who :may wish to discuss the fate of

the annual event. '

f7;'_'i Tonight’s meeting is a necessary one. Because of the
a transformation to the trimester system here, the «usual dates

for Carnivalfall during the third trimester, at a time when

 a’ much reduced student body will be enrolled in classes.

. Herein lie the troubles which future Festivals face. The
Carnival shows which are produced and the booths which
are constructed each year require a-considerable amount of
manpower‘ V

. This manpower, undoubtedly, will not be available
during the thirdtrimester. What, then, can be done to make
Spring Festival be a feasible occasion each year? A

This is the question that must be answered in part at the
discussion meeting. Each group or individual should be pre-
pared to offer his ideas for a solution-to this dilemma. Nat-
urally, no deﬁnite decision can be reached in a couple hours
of discussion. But in those couple" of hours the groundwork
for‘ an eventual decision can be laid,

Several obvious ideas can be expressed. Festival could
be moved up to the Winter, or second, trimester. This sug-
gestion, however, has a major drawback. If the event is held
in either March or April, chances are the weather would be
more of a hindrance than it has been in the past.

Perhaps the location of the Carnival could be moved
from the Forbes Avenue lawn of the Cathedral to an inside
site, such as the Field House. This, too, presents problems.

In all probability the crowd that is usually attracted to

_ the convenient Cathedral lawn all would not be willing to

travel the extra distance to the out-of-the-way Field House.
Thus, it is easy to ‘see the difficult problems facing any-
one who attempts to solve the Festival dilemma. A solution

must be found, hower. And it is up to the students to ﬁnd _

that solution. Carnival time, despite the complaints of the
faculty, offers one of the most enjoyable atmospheres dur-
ing the school year. ,

We feel certain that the collective minds of interested
students can ﬁnd the answer to the problem so that.Spring
Festival can continue uninterrupted this year and in suc-
ceeding years.

Summer Report;  . . .

Glimpse of Grenoble

By David Brealesfone

The broad shafts of early morning sunlight
penetrate into Rue du Vieux Temple with diﬂiculty.
The street is narrow andia little crooked, lined on
both sides by ancient, leaning buildings that effec-
tively bar the angled rays of light.

What this street lacks in visual clarity is com-
pensated for by noise: the shouts
of boys with books under their
arms, the squalling brakes o£_a. 7
score of Lambrettas, the curious-
ly dissonant bells of. the neigh-
boring Church of Notre Dame. .

At No. 1 Rue du Vieux 
Temple, the old section of the
University of Grenoble stands in
tarnished dignity. This section of
the thriving, modern city of
Grenoble, in southeast.ern
France, is known as -- the Old
City. The medievaltown of Grenoble‘ was located
here, and in the fourteenth century the University’s
ﬁrst class was called together somewhere within
the"Old City walls. _ '

 

Ancient University -
The University building which still stands in

‘this ancient part of Grenoble is /perhaps 250 years

old, and in the shadows of the summer morning it
welcomes the foreign students who have come to
study French language and civilization.

Grenoble claims to have the. oldest summer

. school"'in Europe. .When classes began last ‘July 1

there were about V 550 students enrolled in the
school. They had . wandered into Grenoble from
the United States, Britain, the Continent,‘ Africa,
andthe Far East. The Americans were the most
numerous, outnumbering the Swedish students" by

a fair margin. Most of the Swedes were ‘girls, of V

the blonde, blue—eyed milk-fed variety.

_ Starting the last week in Junethe inﬂux be-
gan with _boys and. girls"arriving by train, car,
scooter, and bike. Several boys from Cambridge

 

    
     

even managed to hitch-hike down from Le Havre '

in three days. Incidentally,/htich—hiking is a per-
fectly legal and socially acceptable means of travel
in Europe. 4 ‘

All Roads. Lead to

The university dormitories were ﬁlled by the
end of June. Students arriving later found bed
and board in pensions, private homes, and old

  
 

apartments. The tempo of living in Grenoble”
speeds up with the large number of young people
in town, most of whom are used to keeping late
hours, contrary to European tradition.

The summer school schedule went along
smoothly, uncannily so, considering the great num-
ber of transient tourists. It was’ possible to register
for just two weeks, and the reputation of Grenoble
seemed to attract the curious'for a quick look.
Some stayed, others participated in a few classes,

or cafe “discussion” groups” and then took to the

always-inviting road again.

Monday through Friday mornings, from eight 

until ten, sections in intensive review of grammar,
composition, and vocabulary started the vacation
scholars’ ,day. On Tuesday and Thursdays, from
10:30 to 11:30, large sections in translation were

held. The various nationalities were grouped to- .'

gether in these translation classes, and the assign-
ments consisted of translating- German, Italian,
English, or Swedish literature, as examples, into
French. * '

Sartre. Safe au Laif _
In the afternoons, the studentslhad the oppor-

tunity to do optional work in conversation and pro-271,-1_»7

nunciation. Lectures were given. daily from‘ 4:30
to 6:30,‘ in the new university -audito.rium,’_on‘ a
wide range of subjects. The Alps, the impression-
ism fmovement in painting, the satire of Jean Paul
Sartre were subjects for guest lecturers during July.

In the evenings students gathered in’ the cafes
to talk, went to_ the movies, or organized their own
parties to sing-and dance. The international ﬂavor
of the city was unmistakeable as ideas, opinions.
prejudices ﬂoated in ‘the air ‘wherever ‘students
went. ' ‘ L

I passed an ‘extremely interesting and enlighten- '
'ing’month of July in Grenoble. Living in a pen-

sion where the three Americans, two Germans, two_'

-‘Italians spoke.French exclusively, I had that singu-

lar experience of learning a foreign language from:
the ground up, so to speak.

Learning in the broadest sense of the'word,,
was what I caught myself doing fall the time.

Equal Rights Urged
By Slack ,W’earers I

Editor, the Pitt‘News:

A few days after orientation
week, I, a green young fresh-
man, dared to commit the unfor-
givable sin of walking around
campus and into the cafeteria in

slacks. And on Saturday, too. I
. was nicely informed of my mis-

demeanor by_,my senior assistant.

I feel, however, that the “no
slacks” rule is grossly unfair.

.The rule is unfair for the reason

that those in command do not
allow slacks but do permit Ber-
muda shorts everywhere except
the classroom. Many of .my
friends and I feel that the ruling
is unjustiﬁed for there is no
consistency in the reasoning in-
volved behind it.

Supposed reasons for the rule,
I was informed, were these: (1)
Slacks are lounging wear and
Bermudas are sports wear. (2)

"Girls look much better in Ber-

mudas than in slacks. (3) Some
girls wear toreadors that are too
revealing.

I think this reasoning is illog-
ical because:

(1) Slacks are as much sport-
ing wear as Bermudas; (2) Not
all girls look better in Bermudas
than in slacks. (3) If the ad-
ministration feels that toreadors
are indecent, why not pass a rule
against them in particular in-
stead of slacks in general?

Aside from reasons of personal
appearance, there are reasons_of
personal choice. Has, the country
"reached the point where _it ‘tells
its citizens what to wear? If the
answer to this is “Certain kinds
of clothes are not within decent

   

" - This

      
   

that slacks are not,’ then may I
ask you are Bermudas?

A Frustrated Freshman

‘Are. You Ready?’
Cheerleader Asks

Editor, the Pitt News:

question, “Are You
Ready?,” will be. asked many
times by the cheerleading squad
this year, especially during the
present football sesaon. The
question uppermost in my mind
is, will you, the student body, be

, ready to respond enthusiastically
_ and let our team know that you

are with them all the way —
win or lose.

When we ‘played Marquette,
the only student support present
was that of our. Varsity March-
ing Band, and they came
through with enthusiastic cheer-
ing as well as presentinga ﬁne
pre—game and half-time show.

Had we had some Pitt rooters
shouting “Fight Pitt Fight” or
“Hold That Line” out in the
Coliseum last Saturday I feel
conﬁdent that our Panthers
would have given a better ac-
count of themselves against
Southern Cal. ‘

This Saturday they go against
another team from California,
UCLA. Only this time John
Miche1osen’s charges will be

playing on familiar turf, that of

our own stadium.

There’s no reason why, with
a block of more than a thousand
students and our 120-piece
marching band, the team
shouldn’t hear rather clearly our
chants, cheers ‘and cries of “We
Want A Touchdown.” Who
knows, they might score us a
‘couple! ‘

This-‘Friday night there will
b_e.a combination pep-rally, ‘car-
a-van, bonfire, and kick~oﬁ

dance, and we would like to see p A
as.many students as possible at- I

tend ‘this multiple. event. The
time: 7:30 p.m.; place: Student

V’ Union. Bring ‘your friends. I’m
» sure they will enjoythe festivi--
. ties, and if you have a car,'bring 

that too. ’

In closing, I would; like, to
mention a few brief but im-

portant thoughts. At the game. "

Saturday, .sit in your respective

group, sorority, fraternity, etc., I

where and when possible, for
it aids cheering.

Don’t always? wait for the 
' cheerleaders to organize a cheer;
I if you or your group feel like

cheering, do so and we (the
cheerleaders) down , front will
pick it up. \

When a cheer is announced, *

usually during a time out, your
attention and cooperation will
be appreciated. Support and ap-
plaud our band, for it is a great
organization. I’m sure their per-
formance on Saturday will thrill

    
  

 

those of you who are seeing 4"-fl I‘

them for the ﬁrst time as well '

as you who "are “old hands.’=’
Block “-P” will be functioning
at half-time, and to the viewing.

public it is an impressive sight. ‘

Everyone do his part in order
to make each presentation as
accurate as possible. And last
but not least, let’s show our
guests and our own alumni what
school spirit is. There’s no stop-
ping a ﬁred—up team, and who’s

to ﬁre them up but you the stu-' Rf

dent body?

Has Spultered
First 2 Games

By LARRY HAGGERTY

llIllIllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIA1

.

Like--tlhe children's nurs-ery song, “OIW-here 0 Where Has
My Little Dog Gone?” the theme in»Pittsburgh football circles
these days is, “O Where 0 Where Has the Pitt Offense Gone?”

.. Your guess is just as good as mine as to why the Panther at-

tack has sputtered so noticeably in the ﬁrst two games against

' Marquette and USC. _ .

’ When the Panthers squeezed by Marquette 21-15, they
were in very poor physical condition. Co-captain Bill Lind-
nerand Chuck Reinhold saw. almost no action at all while
Ivan Toncic was suffering from a very painful knee injury
as he directed the 1ocal’s offensive unit.

To make matters worse, most of the Panthers were ‘still
suffering from various bruises gathered in coach John Mich-
elosen’s last full-scale preseason scrimmage.

* * * . *

Thus everyone blamed the Blue and Go1d’s poor showing
on the injuries and the fact that this was Marquette’s biggest
home opening game in their football history, so they naturally
were up for the contest. ,

A fact that was not known to most tri-state gridiron fol-
lowers was, however, that three pro scouts were watching
Marquette’s fullback, Frank Mestnik, perform. As a result of
all these various circumstances many Panther rooters de-«
cided that Marquette had a pretty good football- team so.
good in fact tnat they were shutout by Detroit last Saturday
night, 14-0.

*

3 * * * *

The Jungle Cats entered last Friday night’s tilt‘ with
Southern California in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in
good physical condition. The only exceptions were ‘Toncic
who was still being bothered by his knee injury and sopho-

‘more guard, Regis Coustillac.

 

Toncic failed to move the Panthers against the
Trojans in their 23-0 defeat, but it wasn't his fault as
anyone on the Cat squad will tell you. The Blue and Gold
line was unable to give the senior quarterback any pro-
tection against USC’s ferocious forward wall and as the
result Toncic spent most of the evening on the Coliseum’s
turf. ' I '

He lost 47 yards on attempted passes and was rushed so
bad that three of his tosses were intercepted. When Toncic
was ‘hit extremely hard on two successive plays at the start
of the last quarter, Michelosen rushed in Dave Kraus to pre-

, ‘ vent Toncic from being buried alive.

Kraus’ first pass was intercepted as was the case when
Pete Prince replaced Kraus a few minutes later. This proves
only one thing: the Panthers do not have an adequate of-
fensive replacement for Toncic and this can and probably
will be quite serious if Toncic’s knee doesn’t heal.

* * ‘ * IF *

With the exception of a few pass completions by Toncic‘
and some hard running by right halfback Curt Plowman and
John Yaccino, the Panthers just did not show any offense.

' Yaccino, a sophomore from Hazleton, is probably the fastest

V?"

   

man on the squad, but he may not play this Saturday when
the Panthers inauguate their home campaign against UCLA
because of a Charley horse suffered in the Southern. Cal
skirmish.

The main reason for the poor offensive showing of
the Panthers to date, beside the poor line play, is that
MicheIoscn’s offense simply lacks imagination. How many
times have the Panthers used pitchouts and other wide-
open plays? The answer is quite obvious—not too many.

Unless Michelosen opens up his attack, and that doesn’t
mean ﬂanking an end or a halfback, and ﬁnds a replacement
for Toncic on offense, ‘the Panthers may not win another
_game in 1959 with the exceptions of Boston College and West
Virginia.

The Uclans will be spearheaded
by senior Tailback, Wild Bill_ Kil-

games last season due to a wrist
fracture. Sports experts on the
West Coast are comparing Kilmer
with former Bruin All-American,
Paul Cameron.

In last year's ‘ Panther-UCLA

‘Panthers Hope to Bounce Back

Iflnjuries, Offense Improve

By TED COLTON

After playing their ﬁrst two
games on the road, Coach
Johnny Michelosen’s Panthers
will welcome the friendly
conﬁnes of their own Pitt Sta-
dium. The team that was tag-
ged to win half their games comes

‘home with a 1-1, record and will

meet a good UCLA team Satur-
day.

The Panthers are hoping to
bounce back aftertheir one-sided
loss to USC, a-.» game which not
only hurt them physically but
may have set them back mentally.

This will be a “must” game for

the Cats who cannot afford to lose

to UCLA with such teams .as TCU,
Syracuse, Notre Dame, and Penn
State yet to-be played.

If they are going to‘ beat the
Bruins the Panthers will have to

get some spark -into their lagging-
ioffense. For the past two weeks
Ivan Toncic, has...

Quarterback
been hampered with a knee in-
jury. He should be improved by
Saturday and this will improve

-the Panthers running game.

Against USC Toncic was,un-
able to escape oncharging line-
men and as a result he couldn’t
get away many of his passes. If
Toncic would have been able to
;run he could have rolled out to
the left or‘ri’gh't. thus having a
better chance to get "rid of the
. ball or .else pick/'up1 some yard-
agerunning. ‘ .
Line coach Jack Wiley will have

to do some patching up in the

middle of the line; it was the
cause for Toncic not getting en-
ough time to pass. The return

of Regis Coustillac and Dick Mat-
yus, who have been on the in-’

jured list, may help strengthen

the farward wall.

Norton Seaman and; Seraﬁno
Fazio, two seniors, have looked
very good on defense in their

Slippery Rock Provides Initial Opposition
__To Coach. Bemis’ Untcste‘d4Panther. Eleven
' I I‘ By JACK SMITH. ‘ ,

Playing their ﬁrst soccer game of /the season today with
Slippery-Rock at 3:30 p.m. on Ellsworth ﬁeld, the Panther
"'- booters will discover two things; if their defense is still strong
andii the offense has discovered anything resembling a scor-

 ing punch.

Last year Coach Leo Bemis’ booters, who ﬁnished the

‘_the Rockets 2-1. On the other
hand Slippery Rock ﬁnished with
P. ‘Ia 6-3 record and having many let-
’ termen returning are expected to
ﬁe1d'a strong team. Last week
they tripped Lock Haven 4-2. '
Expects to Improve
, _ “I think we will ﬁeld a strong
73'-" team also,” Bemis said. “Our de-
itense is looking better ‘every day,
and if the line comes through with
the kind of scoring that I know
they are capable of we are bound
to improve on last year.’s record.”
Thus far the Cats haven’t had
a potent scorer. “Simeon Pes-
tich looks like the best bet in
the "clutch, but is still too early
to sell,” said Bemis.

There are other men, however,
 I who have thepotential to be scor-
‘V ers. Lineman Bob Murdoch, Bob
Fiedler, Bob Jerich and Ron Prado
all could come throughif they get
what Bemis terms the “scoring
bug.”

Data Disproves Point

Bemis claims thathis team has
no real strong points, but so far
statistics prove different. The Pan-
thers have always been stingy
whenitcomes to giving the op-
position goals and this year should
prove to be no exception.

and will most likely be there at

stated'Be,mis. “We are sure that

,, Disagreement   

Falls‘ as Rain

Among Yogis

Into one of their many secret
hideaways to mill over their
selections. When they emerged
they announced they were in al-

back for his turn in spotlight.
Although there are a few dis-
senters, Phil has received a. vote
of confidence for the game on
Saturday with Leland. D
Leland would have a chance ex-
cept for. the fact that he was still
out with Brunhilda.
