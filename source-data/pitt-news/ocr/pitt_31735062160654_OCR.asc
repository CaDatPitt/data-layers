For Faculty

University of Pittsburgh
Alumni Council, in a resolu-
tion appearing in the current
issue of The Alumni News Re-
view, urged University grad-
uates to support an increase
in faculty salaries.

,.. According to a recent news re-
lease more than 47,000 alumni in
particular were asked to help in-
sure the future of higher educa-
tion and the nation by backing the
drive to “increase the ﬁnancial re-
wards of teaching."

The University Alumni Council
resolved that the great value of
annual alumni investments in the
faculty be emphasized in the fu-
ture “because of the compelling
national necessity, because of cur-
rent strenuous efforts to increase
facultylsalaries at our own insti-
tution and because of alumni re-
sponsibility to provide leadership
in this fundamental endeavor . . .”

The resolution stated further
that the alumni of all institu-
tions of higher learning have
both an opportunity and a re-
sponsibility for leadershipgwhich
must be grasped if our country
is to master the challenge.

Matters concerning improve-
ment of our centers of higher
learning are of public concern‘; ac-
cording to the release.

The resolution told a1umni- that
every gift is important in itself,
regardless of size, and pointed out
that every contribution is valuable
beyond its worth in dollars and
cents.

“Our pride in our degrees will
continue to grow as the stature
of ’ the University continues to
rise,” the message continued,
"‘for a university’s achievements
reﬁect upon all who are asso-
ciated with it.

“As alumni, we share not only
in the past of our University. We
share equally in its future,” the
article concluded.

Histores Presented

Dr. John Neitz presents historical books to the University.

Largest Book Collection Comes

To Library From John Nietz

The nation’s largest private collection of historic text--
. books will become- a part of the -University of Pittsburgh

library.

l

The collection is a gift from the owner and collector,
Dr. John Nietz, professor of education at the University.
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld formally accepted the

collection from Dr.
ceremony in the chancellor’s office.
The collection of more than
8,000 old textbooks valued at
more than $20,000 will be
known as “The Nietz Old Text-
book Collection” and will be
housed as a special. collection in
the University Library.

A special bookmark has been
designed to mark all books in th
collection. '

“This collection of rare and val-
uable professional and educational
books will make available to fu-
ture generations of students a rich
store of knowledge about the his-
tory and development of Ameri-
can primary and secondary edu-
cation.

“The University of Pittsburgh is
fortunate indeed,” the Chancellor
said, “to have this collection be-
come a part of its permanent
archives.”

Included in Dr. Nietz’s collec-
tion are such volumes as the
400-year-old Hornbooks. Noah
Webster’s blue-back speller and
McGuffey’s readers. The books
date froml early textbooks used
before Colonial days through
the turn of the century.

The earliest primer known, a
one-page, hand lettered medieval
hymn in Latin, printed in Frank-
fort, Germany, dated 1594 is
among the valuable texts in the
collection.

Dr. Nietz uses his collection in
teaching his education classes at

Matthews Presents

. Ingersoll Works

To Poetry Group‘

Dr. Jack Matthews, chairman of
the Speech Department ‘will pre-

sent prose readings by Ingersoll

tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. in the Stu-
dent Union. -

Dr. Matthews ‘ will read the
works‘ of Ingersoll which, accord-
ing to him, express profound be-
liefs and ideals concerning in-
dividual liberty.

He will also include well-known
funeral orations, one of which was
given upon the death of his broth-
er and the other at the funeral of
a young child.

These orations which are es-
sentially eulogys have become
classics through the century.
Dr. Matthews had a two-fold
purpose in mind when he de-
cided to include Ingersoll’s ma-
terial.

He pointed out, “Although
Ingersoll spoke more than a cen-
tury ago, his works are in keep-
ing with the modern American
ideals and express a deep respect
for the dignity of the human per-
sonality. A

“The beauty of language he
used in expressing his ideals will

To Endorse

Final Adoption Of SGA

By EDWIN ZINMAN

"Student Congress unanimously endorsed the proposed
constitution of the University of Pittsburgh Student Govern-
ment Association at the culmination of Monday’s meeting.

This new SGA will succeeded the present Congress.

Chairman Howard Rossen, Col. ’58, of the Committee of
Student Government Evaluation presented the constitution
to SC which was initially conceived in a previous Congress
and is the result of two years study and consideration .

~A subcommittee on Student Government chaired by

Dr. Boyer, associate‘ professor of 9

Political Science, also approved
the Constitution at its ‘Feb. 14
meeting as representative of
Student, Affairs Committee of
the administration. '

Immediate adoption and the
constitution’s ﬁnal recognition is
subect to vote of the entire student
body as slated by SC.

In Congress’s ﬁnal revisions be-
fore submission to the student

body several changes were made.

Larry Fiedler, Bus. Ad. ’58,
successfully moved that the Vice
President rather than President
preside and call meetings of the
Executive Committee.

Later Congress supported Fied-
ler in his motion to delete grad-
uate students as eligible to vote in
the open election of President and
Vice President.

A proposal to retain the elec-
tion of President and Vice Pres-
ident by SGA rather than the
constitutional provision for elec-
tion at large by the student
body received a necessary ma-
jority vote by 9 to 8.

At this point Advisor Jack
Hardman interceded and implied
the need for reconsideration.
I-Iardman noted, “This Constitu-
tion is the result of two years in-
tensive research and editing by
students, faculty, and administra-
tion.

“To include this proposal
would in effect change the con-
cept of ultimate control of stu-
dent government by students.
Furthermore the administrating
would need to reconsider the
constitution as revised causing
unnecessary delay.”

Dick Mattern, Col. ’59, moved to
reconsider his previous motion
and subsequently upon a re-vote
the original proposal was defeated.

At the suggestion of Pat Perri,
Col. ’59, a committee of present
members of SC will be formed to
draw up suggested by-laws that
the new SGA might utilize.

The ‘Constitution speciﬁcally
states that an honor code be
eventually established at Pitt.

Eligibility for membership in
SGA was raised to 1.5 over-all
quality point average or 1.75 for
the preceding semester.

Hitherto the Freshmen were
unrepresented in Congress. but
the new SGA will include two
Freshman representatives. 

The resignation of, -Robert
Muzik-, Engr. '58, as delegate to
Congress, was .announced. ~

the University. The books also
provide a. basis for research and
numerous doctoral candidates
have drawn material from this

I - collection.

Dr. Nietz said most of the
textbooks deal with the theory
of education, not the practice.
“Well trained teachers of the
past taught directly from the
books. Through these books we
may see the changes that have
been made. ' ”

“I have used these books to en-
rich my own teaching, for writing
dissertations and for research.
Since I am retiring this year, I

, feel I don’t want the collection to
' lie dormant.

“The books will be housed as a
special collection of the Univer-
sity library. They can continue to
be used for research and refer-
ence by the student body.”

Dr. Nietz has been a member of
the faculty of the School of Edu-
cation since 1926 and has held the
rank of professor since 1939.

l" Pluribus Unum

The long-awaited answer to many local Student Gov-
ernment problems may have arrived in the Student Govern-
ment Association. ‘ 1

This organization will now, upon vote of the student
body, assume the role of the student government agency
representing all the students at this university.

a The problems of duplicity of role can now be eliminat-
ed. The _;§nany haggles of Student Congress with Associated

. Women ‘Students and Men’s Council over parallel author-

ities should be at an end.

It is diﬁicult to say what total effectthe whole program
will have on the student body. If students persist in disre-
garding the workings and affairs of their representative
government group the new structure may be a complete
failure. _

If the students as a whole (rather than a limited fra-
ternity faction) support the new body, somethinglasting
and worthwhile is certain to be the outcome.

The student government group may then govern in-
stead of making weak statements about various things
from time to time. .

Operation of the student government association will
not be smooth because problems remain as to the imple-
mentation of the new constitution.

The power of this group -is unparalleled among student
groups, yet it is doubtful that they will be afforded real

, power in the matter of the budget.

They are, at least, provided the power to “participate”
in the allocation of funds.

Perhaps from students’ effective insights into problems
and capabilities of student group divisions of the Student
Activities budget by SGA will result.

We should not expect an immediate panacea to rid us
of all our government ills. What we have is a cohesive, co-
ordinated, well-thought out student-administrative effort
to cope with our problems. i ‘

r The students should take it for what it is, read it, vote
upon it, and support the oﬂicers elected under it. Only stu-
‘dent support can lend the needed body of authority to the

V skeletal program.

This constitution is not an end but the beginning of a
new dimension in government.

Peake Explains
Possibilities Of
Future Growth

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor for student affairs,
has released the following
statement to The Pitt News
in’ connection with the pro-
posed Student Government
Association constitution.

“The p r o p o s e d constitution
raised ground-work for sing1e'uni—
versity-wide student government
organization in place of the pres-
ent three or
more with con-
fused responsi-
bilities.

“G o o d stu-
d e n t govern-
ment has to be
built up out of
e x p e r i e n ce.
There is no
complete blue-
print for Uto-
pia.

“The com-
mittees have done a good job,
I believe, in providing a basis
from which effective student
government can evolve.”

Dr. Peake also remarked: “We
will work as effective methods
as we can to give SGA more re-
sponsibility.” .

This will be done on the basis
of “mutual understanding and
conﬁdence,” as arrived at through
the stages of responsibility esta-
blished in the newt outline.

Dr. Peake mentioned in rela-
tion to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee that it was announced
prior to the beginning of any
student government evaluation
and that this is a necessary and ,
typical group to most universi-
ties.‘

It centralizes the responsibilities
of many administrative-faculty
groups of the past to allow for an
overall view. It also allows for
student representation as do many
of the new administrative-faculty
committees.

adoption of the constitution.

“As a total it is basically good,"
he said, “but I
am opposed to
certain phases
of it.” The con-
stitution is be-
ing presented to
the s t u d e n 1;
body for its ap-
proval.

Opposes Two
Sections

P a .r k i n-
son added that
‘ ‘ o v er 1 h e
years the new SGA will provide
a more effective student govern-
ment for Pitt.”

He is opposed to two major
sections of the proposed consti-
tution, and has voiced his oppo-
sition to the committee which
drew up the document. The sec-
tions that he is opposed to are
included in the constitution as it
now stands.

“Due to my philosophy of gov-
ernment I am opposed to Article
3, Section 2,” he said. This section
states that candidates for the pres-
idential and vice-presidential of-
ﬁces must have at least one semes-
ter experience on SGA, and have
been an oiﬁcer of another student
organization.

Against ‘At-Large Elections’

He believes that the clause is a
basic violation of democratic prin-
ciples.

He is also opposed to the “at
large elections” of these officers. ,
He believes that they should be
elected by the SGA body itself.

Parkinson said that the only
qualiﬁcation for these. oﬂices
should be a 1:5 QPA and be a full-
time undergraduate. “A leader can
be good even if he has no experi-
ence,” he said. *

“Student government at Pitt

will, in time, become more ef-

Parkins/on

. fective than it is now. This will

not come‘ at once, but it will‘
come about?!

Parkinson also predicts that the

clauses to which he is opposed will

I be eliminated within five years.

dent of Men’s Council stated,
“I feel this constitution will
provide students with more op-
portunity to demonstrate man-
agement of student government.
It will place one organization as
paramount at Pitt.”

Dr. William Boyer, Department
of Political Science, who heads the
Student Affairs Committee which
was also concerned with the
changes, made the following ob-
servations.

Provides Structure

“I think this new constitution
which was submitted today at the
SC meeting by the Rossen com-
mittee provides structure within
which an effective and responsible

student government can evolve.

Pan-Hellenic, IFC

By MILLARD AMDUR

Irving Rothman, graduate»

assistant in the dean of men’s
office, was chairman of the
committee for reorganization
of student government as an
undergraduate.

After working on the proposed
changes, he stated: “The revision
will organize student government
and give all participating bodies a

sense of something to do. Dupli-‘

cation of re- .
sponsibility is at ; ‘
a minimum. _

“If each of 
the groups con- 3
ceives of its re-
sponsibility.
within areas, it ’
may better see
its objectives.
For this reason,
I can’t under-
stand why Pan-
hel is not con- .
sidered a living area when IF is.

Create Living Atmosphere

“When we were discussing the

problem on the committee, we de-

Rothman

cided that although IF and Panhel _

work on numerous projects, these
become tools for creating a living
atmosphere.

“People join T H E P I T '1‘
NEWS and Pitt Players, for ex-
ample, for the purpose of learn-
ing to create more effectively.

“If they have social affairs, it
becomes a side event. Fraternities
and sororities are organizations
people join’ for social values.
Everything else is secondary and
helps to realize these values.

Prevent Popularity Contests

“Personally I feel the all-uni-
versity election of president will
make more people aware of stu-
dent government and yet the re-
strictions imposed upon persons
running for oﬁice will prevent
popularity contests.

“Student government, because
it has the right to sit in on allo-
cation or funds and to control
‘academic honors, will become
from our survey one of the
strongest student governments
in the country.

“We found in studying student
government that a" number of
schools" had recently conducted
surveys or were revising consti-
tutions. '

Tradition Barred Uniﬁcation

“Problems of a weak student
government obviously exist not
only on our campus, but on many
campuses throughout the nation.

“However, an ineffectual gov-
ernment was orr our campus too
long because tradition had pre-
vented uniﬁcation of our basic
governmental bodies.

“Future bodies must realize that
tradition, while important to sta-
bilize governments, must never
stand in the way of constructive
reform.

“Anything more that can be
done must be done through en-
lightened leadership. Success of
this organization, like any stu-
dent government body, depends
upon leadership that has the
guts to express student view-
point and will take time to find
it out. ,.

7 Lehigh Tilt Tops In East

, By JIM LACEY

The “battle of the East” will be on tap when the Lehigh
Engineers and the Panthers meet at 8 p.m. at the Field
House. The Engineers come into the contest with a sparkling
7-0 record, while the Blue and Gold have a loss in nine meets.
Weekly eliminations between team members to see who

_ will face_ Lehigh began on Tuesday. Every week starting

positions are taken by the sur-$ V

vivors of these eliminations. This
week as in the past, the most ri-
valry will be at the 130 and 147
pound classes. Bob Irwin, Robert
Szekley, and Sherm Moyer will
all be vieing for the 130 slot. The
147 has just as many contenders
with Ted Bienkowski, Bob Sent-
ner, and Bruce Johnson.

Other prabable starters will in-
clude Paul Powell (123), Vic De-

Felice (137), Bob Richardson
(157), Dave Johnson (167), and
Tom Hall, heavyweight. Alex
Skirpan and Tony Vuocolo are
contenders for the 177 pound
berth.

Davidson Wrestles HW
Lehigh will be hampered by in-
juries to two of their starters.
Dave D’Antonio will replace Bob

Myers, in the 123 pound class
while Mel Feroe replaces Bob
Gunst at 157. Leon Harbold

(130), Joe Gratto (137) and Rich-
ard Santoro (147) will still face
the’ Panthers.

Other Engineers will be John

Driscoll (167), Russ Triponey

_ (177) and Pete Davidson in the
heavyweight.

The Panthers and Engineers
have met three common opponents
in Syracuse, Navy and Army. Both
teams defeated these opponents.
The Blue and Gold took the mea-
sure of_ Syracuse 20-5, while the
Engineers won 19-8. Navy went
down to defeat 14-11 to Lehigh
and 18-8 to the Panthers. Lehigh
whipped Army 19-9 while the
Jungle Cats down_ed the Cadets
22-5.

Last Saturday night the Panthers
captured their eighth victory in
nine tries and stretched their dual
victory streak to 37 of the last 39

 

meets when they up—ended the '

Middies at Annapolis by an 18-8.
count.

Powell Wins Seventh
The Blue and Gold took six of
eight matches »to hand the Navy-
men their first loss of the season.

Powell, the sensational sopho-
more, kept his winning streak
intact by disposing of Jim Mc-
Kinney in the 123 pound class,
6-2. Sherm Moyer (130) whip-
ped Gene Kesseler by a similar
score. ,

DeFelice outpointed Captain Joe

 Panthers Battle Tartans;

Prelim To Mountaineers

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
Clinging to dubious hopes for a post-season tournament
bid, the Panther basketball team entertains Carnegie Tech
tonight at the Memorial Field House and moves to Morgan-
town on Saturday to complete the home and home; series

with West Virginia.

The Blue and Goldostopped the cross-Oakland Tartans

86-68 last month and will be fa‘-6

vored to repeat the easy win.
Nevertheless, Mel Cratsley’s Engi-
neers always put up a stubborn
ﬁght against the locals.

Tech has a high-scoring fresh-
man forward from Duquesne in
5'9” Bill Sofia. In the ﬁrst en-
counter Soffa tallied 33 points and
set a Skibo record by sinking 21
free throws. Don Hennon, in that
game, picked up 34 points and
throttled the emotional Sofia in
the second half. In fact, Hennon so
rattled Soffa in that part of the
game, that the Duquesne mite ap-
pealed to the referees for succor.

..Tu.cci High Scorer

Since the Panthershellacking,
the Tartans have played teams
more on a par with. their stabiliz-
ed ability. The result is that they
carry a ﬁve-game winning’ streak
into tonight’s fray. The over-all
season card shows ten wins and
eight losses.

In addition to Sofia, Tech has

a capable starting team. Center ;

Andy Komer and guard John
Tucci, of football fame, have
ranked as the next highest scor-
ers of late. Bud Miller and Tom
l\Iueller round out the starting
quintet.

Mike Flynn, early—season main-
stay, returned to his calculus as
of Feb. 1 and will see tonight’s
“ba_ttlef’ from the stands.

Woznicki Ineligible

Joining Flynn in the stands, but
for different reasons, will be
Panther forward Dick Woznicki.

Woznicki was ruled out of the re— _

maining season competition be-
cause of an ECAC rule which pro-
hibits a player from using more

Sells Soup for 33 Years Then Changes to Neckties

Student Desk Boss FindsWor1§ ing Easy

Sales Gave Berry
Chance for Travel

By TERESA SIRIANNI

Mr. Berry, Supervisor of
the Student Desk, worked for

the H. J. Heinz‘Co. as a sales- I

man for 33 years before com-
ing to the University follow-
ing his retirement.

As a salesman he has travelled

in this area extensively and has
met and talked with many people.

It is easily observed by his help-
fulness at the Student Desk that
Mr. Berry enjoys being with peo-

‘ple. After ﬁve weeks of vacation,

following his retirement in 1950,
Mr. Berry said he was ﬁt to be
tied.

Worked for Chest

He worked for the Community
Chest for a few months and then
came to the University in De-
cember of the same year.

He served as Assistant Cam-
pus Proctor to the Dean of Men
for the ﬁrst ﬁve Years. He re-
lated several amusing incidents
that had happened to him dur-
ing this time.

At one time the Mathematics
Department had been set up tem-
porarily in a room adjoining the
Oval Room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Stranger in the Room

One day a young math instruc-
tor came into the Information Of-

’ «ﬂee to inform Mr. Berry that a

 

strange little old man had gone

into the Oval Room.

Mr. Berry hurried to the room,
opened the door, and found
Chancellor Fitzgerald quietly
rehearsing a speech.

On another occasion, Mr. Berry
noticed a very small boy, neatly
dressed and alone, waiting for the
elevator. In a friendly manner,

. Mr. Berry started a conversation

with the youngster. The boy
wanted to know how to get to the
top of the Cathedral.
It’s Time To Wave

When asked if the matter was
conﬁdential, the little boy replied,
“No. You see, it's 2:45 and, I have
to get to the top of the building by
3 because I’m supposed tolwave to
my friend who will be waving
back from the top of his house in
Wilkinsburg.”

Desk Organized by Biddle
The StudentDesk, organized by

» Dean Biddle, offers many services.

A student can get anything from
a piece of Scotch tape to mend his
book to student insurance to pro-
tect himself.
The Student Desk has for sale
10 to 20 cent stamps, post cards,
student directories, stationery,

No Pet Peeves
When asked if he had any pet
peeves about the student body, Mr.
Berry answered that he didn’t
have and then added, “I have had
more fun here in nearly eight
years than the rest of my life put
together.”
Mr. Berry is a very proud
family man. He says his wife

Mr. Berry said the students may
tease him and call him raspberry

en their task,” concluded the pro-

‘Signiﬁcant Advance’--Hardman

Jack Hardman, assistant to the
dean bf men, advisor to SC, also
commented on the proposals. He
called the constitution “a signiﬁe

cant advance in the student gov- ‘

ernment area of activities to place
it on equal ‘basis with other exist-
ing activity areas.

“It will bring about a depth
experience in the education for
democratic living on part of the
students participating,” he said.

Mrs. Virginia Milligan, . assistant
to the Dean of Women and SC
advisor, could not be reached for
a statement.
